0.00 103.64 speaker0  Hello to all my friends, my enemies, people in extra dimensional beards who feel neutral about my existence, yall know everyone feels nothing but intense love for wolf the dog which is my name, PTBP which is my radio station, and 694.2 which is my favorite grouping of numbers to broadcast on, I'm here to love you as you have loved me and bring you some tasty, tasty information. But first, this week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Mia who tagged that pretending pod on one of them there tweets, thanks for sharing the show with your friends Mia, she writes Greetings, the ladies sewing and seance circle would like to remind everyone that our annual bake sale and dumpster dive are still on for next Friday, the time and location will be on your bathroom Mia when you get out of the shower tomorrow, thanks for passing that on Mr. the dog, thanks Mia. It's good to know the LSSC is still running real strong and generally somehow managing to both creep everyone out and bore them to death simultaneously, but the trick is on y'all I don't have a mirror or a bathroom unless you count the streets of the city that is. Remember, if you want to write up something for your wolf to howl, tag at pretending pod on Instagram or Twitter, tag pretended to be people on Facebook, or write a 5 star review
99.80 112.28 speaker1  If more of your friends listen to the show, you'll have even more stuff to talk about
110.68 209.28 speaker0  just swell. Also the contest happening over on the subreddit ends at 11.59pm central time on September 23rd, if you are listening to this on September 23rd that means it's all over tonight baby, get cracka lacking my pups. Speaking of pretending to be people, it's time for the news. Last time, a whole lot of plot developed just in time for the main event. Get ready y'all, for real, cause this shit, this shit is popping off like beef stroking Are you ready? Because taking us now to the scrap pit is kudzu baby with no back bone.
207.00 453.88 speaker2  sounds of the arena. This colossal room is circular and funnels downward at least 10 stories. There are thousands of seats surrounding a massive covered cage. Think the Octagon from UFC but it's 50 yards across and has a bubble looking rounded top on it that is entirely made of a crystal clear material. Aggressively loud dubstep is blaring, strobe lights are making the entire experience otherworldly as green and red and blue lasers swing wildly around the room. This place feels like futuristic Las Vegas filled with the spirit of all of Vin Diesel's films if they were tarred and feathered, but the tar is replaced by Red Bull and the feathers are replaced by cocaine. away and flashing the words, Oz Mayhem Wolf and Friends vs Planet Juggernaut. my brother. It is an honor and a pleasure to see such bloodsport on a beautiful sunny day in the city. A vast circle in the floor in the arena opens up and from below, planet juggernaut slowly raises into the scrap pit. Thomas raises his hands in the air. lungs out and this thing is a shiny metal sphere 20 feet tall with two metallic arms extending from either side and Thomas just slammed his fist together which is what he described doing when he went into the machine but here's the catch, Thomas, you've never been a planet juggernaut before and I want to give Justin a reason to roll some dice. So, Justin is going to roll a D100 and in order for you to control your body that you're now in, you have to roll under whatever he rolls. Now you don't have to do this every round, you just have to do this until you succeed and then you're fully in control but it might take a couple rounds for you to get used to You might be a notch-ral. You might, you might be a prodigy. Justin, go ahead and roll, let's see what Thomas has to roll underneath to slam his arms together. That's a 50. In Planet Juggernaut, his arms are like outstretched in a very awkward way and one of them goes to swing at the other one to pound its fist into the hand and misses completely, therefore hugging itself. Clark Bishop, regardless of whether or not you think this robot should be hugging itself or slamming its fist together, you are in a Colosseum dome fighting pit against a 20-foot tall robot. I need you to roll a sanity. Keith Vigna, you are already gonzo beans.
452.04 459.00 speaker3  Alright, that is really handy.
458.00 460.00 speaker2  You lose one sanity.
459.00 473.40 speaker3  I hit my breaking point.
467.96 499.64 speaker2  mania from the sample mania's table in the Call of Cthulhu 7th edition rulebook.
496.96 520.70 speaker3  That belief does not seem irrational.
511.80 550.00 speaker2  And number 8 is spelled A-I-L-U-R-O mania, so I'm going to go with aileromania, which is the abnormal fondness for cats. like when you wear a potato sack.
549.00 578.80 speaker3  A three-legged race. That's a potato sack race. They were really on the nose with those names when they came up with those, so you chose which one? That he thinks he's cursed by death magic. Yeah, of course.
571.36 619.24 speaker2  has got to be a rough thing for a god to feel, and 3, you rolled over your power. And my guess is you are a lot closer to Keith Vigna and Oz Mayhem Wolf than you are to Planet Juggernaut. Let's roll a 50-50 shot here.
616.64 650.02 speaker3  So Clark is dressed from the room. He picked up a bomb squad suit, the suits that are really heavily padded with a helmet and everything. He's wearing that. But he also picked up these pneumatic gloves. So think Batman, I think, in one of the Dark Knights had them. Absolutely. He's going against his forearm strength and finger grip strength, and he's just going to lunge straight at Oz, and he's going to try and maybe rip his head off.
643.72 669.20 speaker2  Okay, Oz is going to roll Awareness to see if he's ready for this attack, and he's not. So he's not going to roll against you. You just get to roll an attack on Oz Mayhem Wolf. So go ahead and roll, what would you call that, unarmed combat?
668.20 686.08 speaker3  Correct to my name. Alright, well. That's a zero zero three. Holy shit, that's a success?
683.28 734.72 speaker2  Theoretically trying to snap his neck. Okay. What do you think, D8? Rules knowledge is why people listen to Pretending to be People. The most baseline thing. He's wearing some padding, so he's not going to take all of that damage, but you come up and do you want to describe what you try to do to him here? Because you're not snapping his neck, but you are going to put him in a compromising
733.72 753.92 speaker3  Physically. I'll get him in a headlock, and because Clark hasn't snapped many necks in his life, he's Real bad Charlie Wars.
752.92 761.56 speaker2  Thomas?
757.52 771.64 speaker4  Is Marvin Glass, or is the Emperor in his box anywhere? Interesting.
768.16 791.28 speaker2  be, and it is currently curtained off. Okay.
790.28 795.58 speaker4  That's just him turning on.
793.06 802.84 speaker2  It'll still play. He rolled a 36, Thomas, so you're going to need to roll under a 36.
801.84 815.28 speaker4  64.
812.52 818.44 speaker2  going very conkily and slowly.
817.44 838.52 speaker4  I'm sorry. I had the wrong intent in these dice. All right.
837.52 846.12 speaker2  I do. Then roll heat, baby. Before Justin rolls, tell me what you're trying to finish with this turn here. You're not going to lift off the ground.
844.12 849.76 speaker4  I just wanted to activate.
847.12 862.72 speaker2  Then you failed miserably, and it is Keith's turn. Okay.
860.12 877.28 speaker4  I want to shoot him with my laser eyes. I'm aiming at you, Luke. Okay. Right at Keith, Vigna.
875.64 888.80 speaker2  Let's see if this'll... 19. Five.
887.80 894.84 speaker4  All right.
891.40 900.84 speaker2  What's that look like on your big, metal, shiny, boar body?
899.84 902.84 speaker4  Dr. Eggman. So imagine like that.
901.84 910.44 speaker3  Dr. Robotnik, if you're nasty. Oh, Robotnik. Yeah.
904.84 912.44 speaker4  Just imagine those eyes just like glowing and then shooting lasers out of them at Keith,
911.44 931.92 speaker2  Absolutely. 40% that we talked about. 40%. 40%. Keith, are you going to try to react with a offensive action or are you going to try to dodge in some way?
924.92 944.96 speaker4  I have, in addition to the same bomb squad gear that Clark has on, I have these... I wrote down gump leg braces, but they're super jump slash super run braces on my legs. All right. So I'm going to try to just jump out of the way.
943.96 955.60 speaker2  Base is 30.
954.60 965.24 speaker4  You rolled a three, Thomas. Oof.
964.24 977.60 speaker2  So I jump out of the way. As lasers shoot out of the eyes of Planet Jugger and I... I think like a sterile, shiny metal surface. Okay. So it, like, scorches.
976.60 979.60 speaker4  Yeah.
978.60 986.00 speaker2  And it makes, like, cool little metalworking. Star Wars sparks. It's got the Planet Juggernaut logo. Like... Ooh.
985.00 991.20 speaker4  Yeah. That's why...
990.20 1003.02 speaker3  Can you describe... Much cool. out of its eyes. Where did we see those lasers come from?
1001.02 1005.02 speaker4  The head part, you would be like, oh, that's...
1004.02 1007.02 speaker3  Like, toward the top?
1006.02 1012.02 speaker2  Yeah. If it's a big circle, it's where the eyes might be. Which from...
1011.02 1017.02 speaker4  Not like a smiley face. More like a Pac-Man. Got it. But with now a giant mouth. Just tiny laser eyes.
1016.02 1033.78 speaker3  Nice. Yeah.
1031.70 1051.00 speaker4  So mid-air, I want to pull out... I've got a saw launcher that has diamond-bladed saws that shoot out of it, and I want to aim that over at Planet Juggernaut, and I want to just mid-mass shoot a saw at him.
1050.00 1057.46 speaker2  Like a circular saw, yeah. Okay, gotcha. So go ahead and roll firearms for me.
1055.94 1062.42 speaker4  That's a 42 on a 70.
1057.46 1078.10 speaker2  You can try to make a dodge maneuver here, but you'll have to critically succeed in order to dodge. Okay. No. Keith, describe what this looks like as you're flying through the air. You pull out a saw shooting through.
1073.30 1109.22 speaker4  I see the lasers start to form in his eyes, and I can see that they're aimed mostly at me. So I jump out of the way, and I'm about 10 feet up in the air, going over to the side away from Oz and Clark, and I pull out, kind of looks like a giant crossbow, and it has a giant circular saw on it, and you can tell that the edges are shiny. And I aim it, shoot it, and it flies circular, just shooting right at Planet Juggernaut,
1108.22 1137.62 speaker2  All right. Call that 1d8 plus 3. Planet Juggernaut. The nose is the face's belly button. Take away my laser eyes.
1136.62 1145.18 speaker4  No, no, no.
1138.62 1245.82 speaker2  It is going to take down the damage a little bit, and it embeds itself fully in there as you take 11 damage. Nice. So he is going to roll. If you want to dodge, you can oppose this roll with a dodge roll, Thomas. I crit failed. So basically, he has these boots on that, as he's running toward you, as he's about to take off, he clicks a button and a little thing in his hand, much like one would click the ignition of a bomb or something like that. And as soon as he does so, he gets prepared and ready to jump. He barely makes it out one inch off the ground. He comes out of his shoes, and his boots are stuck to the ground underneath him, and he falls on his face in front of him, halfway in between the group and Planet Juggernaut. What did we see out there? We saw Planet Juggernaut really struggling.
1244.82 1257.90 speaker3  Has he lost it, folks?
1251.42 1326.38 speaker2  thing happen with seemingly one of Oz Mayhem Wolf's friends turning on him in the very first moments of the fight. Let's see if that interbreeding continues throughout this contest. Who knows? to our kiss cam here in the scrap pit. Looking up, you see on the jumbotron, they're showing just these two dudes in the audience who are both cheering and one looks a lot like Luke and the other one looks a lot like Joe. And the camera zooms in on you guys. They look at each other tentatively.
1322.14 1336.86 speaker3  So I'm feeling better now after I got that aggression out of me and I want to yell to Oz. I'm sorry. We're good.
1334.98 1338.86 speaker2  I didn't appreciate it one bit.
1337.86 1356.20 speaker3  Didn't understand. I got it now. All right. I'm aiming at one of the arms. Ooh, interesting.
1355.02 1366.88 speaker4  Negative 40. That's negative 40 for a head shot, but it says negative 20. I don't have a head, so I think it should be negative 40. That makes sense.
1365.00 1381.68 speaker3  Let's call it negative 40. Cool.
1378.28 1407.48 speaker4  tries to swat at the missile no matter what like happens. Love it. We'll see. the crowd.
1401.64 1486.86 speaker2  it actually, the entire like floor that you're on and the dome itself rattles and it like sends reverberations all the way through and you hear just this massive roar from the crowd as they get fucking amped. It's like seeing a wreck, but nobody got hurt yet because it's going to happen later. Probably the hurt, the hurt will happen later. I would imagine. And with that it is a planet juggernaut's turn. roll a dodge out here in front of you. He's going to turn on a defensive mask on his helmet that basically clogs your sensors that show you where people are on the field of battle. And so if he can roll under a 40% actually because you did it, I'll give him a 20% so We will not see the effects of that yet. Um, because Oz mayhem wolf is out of sight, but not out of my mind.
1485.56 1503.90 speaker4  I feel something.
1499.92 1534.82 speaker2  just shot a rocket launcher in your direction. Clark you've already attacked, so you can roll a dodge if you would like to oppose. If you have any sort of a thing on you that can help you mechanically, holler that out a plus 40 on that Dodge, which takes your Dodge up to 90. Holy shit. Is that right? Uh, yeah.
1533.16 1540.94 speaker4  So is this, what is this contested on?
1539.54 1545.58 speaker2  Right.
1544.58 1549.06 speaker4  It's a contest.
1545.58 1552.66 speaker3  So you just did cause I rolled a nine. I passed, but I was lower than him. Oh, I see how that works.
1551.66 1592.86 speaker4  Okay. So this all kind of happens in one move. Like he's puttering over towards Oz and he like flicks the rocket as he's coming down onto him. And then he kind of like Springs up back towards Clark. You see the little helicopter blade where again, he's just had his hand up from where he flipped the thing and he just brings it straight down at Clark. Oh, okay.
1591.86 1625.12 speaker2  Okay.
1624.12 1627.12 speaker4  You've gotten a lot of luck. Don't you?
1626.12 1644.38 speaker3  Yeah. It's 10 whole points to reduce it by one D six, which isn't that big a deal if you're rolling 12 of them at a time. Six of them.
1643.38 1671.14 speaker2  All right. It is your turn. Okay.
1665.74 1679.80 speaker4  that I have on to suction on to the wall, maybe like 10 feet above him.
1677.36 1681.80 speaker3  Fucking dope.
1680.80 1698.24 speaker2  Okay. Uh, so you can roll a firearms check in order to try to attain that goal. Thomas, do you want to combat it in a Dodge movement? Yes.
1697.24 1707.70 speaker4  Fair. I got a 65 on a 70. Oh shit.
1702.34 1716.42 speaker2  So describe what happens is you basically, so I go from where I landed after shooting
1714.74 1745.88 speaker4  from him as well. I use one hand with a suction glove to suction on to the dome. I pull out the nitro thrower and I just let it unload all over the top of planet juggernaut.
1744.88 1755.12 speaker2  useless. Yeah. Nice.
1747.88 1770.36 speaker4  You see another little propeller pop up, but it takes a second to whir around.
1762.18 1802.88 speaker2  looking in the dent planet juggernaut left in the floor, you see crawling out from the dent is Oz mayhem Wolf and he looks fucking rough and he crawls and he sits cross-legged and tries to put his boots back on. First we have Clark Bishop shooting a rocket launcher that gets flicked right out of the way. What'd you think about that one, Nick?
1800.52 1820.86 speaker3  anything useful at all for his team. Planet juggernaut smashed that scrappy fellow like a plastic bag filled with warm ground up pork. I don't know about you, but I am positively starving. I am absolutely hungry now.
1815.02 1830.86 speaker2  And then planet juggernaut just sits right on top of Oz mayhem Wolf before bouncing off to slap Clark Bishop right on top of the head.
1829.86 1853.70 speaker3  emerge alive.
1848.82 1927.72 speaker2  a cadet from the city do some very cool movements. What did you think about the stuff that he did? Down in the field, we have our correspondent. What's our correspondent's name tonight, Nick Nichols? Who's down there? Who do we got? Jeremiah Jones, I think. Jeremiah Jones is down there and he's got three contestants from the audience and he is ready to interview them now and ask some questions. Let's take it down to Jeremiah. If you want to introduce yourselves, what is your name, sir?
1926.72 1932.96 speaker4  Woo!
1931.68 1942.88 speaker2  I'm little Davey. I'm David's son.
1941.88 1963.14 speaker3  Woo! Woo! Hello there. I came to see everybody he's in. I love him so.
1961.18 1970.30 speaker2  It's got Planet Juggernaut on it. Would you like that tonight, guys?
1966.58 2022.54 speaker3  Yeah, I'll give it to my dad if I win.
2021.54 2050.76 speaker2  I remember everything. We've got a trivia question. It's little Davey. Oh, little Davey.
2046.20 2065.72 speaker3  Um, uh, blue. That's right. You get a t-shirt. There are blue birds.
2064.00 2075.10 speaker4  A single tear. I love you, little Davey.
2069.74 2101.16 speaker2  We had to make some of the questions a bit easier because people were not sober enough to answer proper trivia questions. Let's go back down to that third question. What do you think about all that, Nick? to support his friend from the Motherland. May Oz Wolf. Hey, Mayhem.
2099.16 2120.48 speaker3  It's, uh, Farsi. Yeah, Farsi, thanks for coming down. I don't, I don't know Oz. I just, I just identify with him.
2118.64 2127.34 speaker2  you having a good time?
2126.34 2134.48 speaker3  That's right. That's right. You are worried.
2133.48 2163.22 speaker2  You won a t-shirt. Nick Nickels, what did we think about all this trivia we're having around here today? Little Davey is on his Dave's shoulders.
2160.70 2172.94 speaker3  True parental greatness.
2171.94 2190.76 speaker2  country. All right.
2187.66 2241.12 speaker3  So I'm kind of under the hand of the thing now. I want to try and wriggle out and use a magnetic trap that I brought with me. I figure I'll set it under where I am right now, hopefully trapping his arm there. I was hoping I could use a survival skill for that as far as setting traps go. Fucking God. I would. I crit fail.
2240.12 2263.50 speaker2  Me damn it. Clark Bishop, as you go to set this, what do you have on you? Let's go ahead and say that as you set this trap and start to scuttle backwards, the trap sets earlier than you thought it was going to and your rocket launcher flies out of your
2262.14 2269.38 speaker3  That makes sense.
2268.38 2325.06 speaker4  Oh no. are opening up and like letting some steam out. off the dome to get, try to get to the far end, as far away as I can from a planet juggernaut. And I want to set up a mounted 50 cal machine gun with armor piercing bullets and let go.
2319.70 2358.56 speaker2  So first things first, I need you to roll a dexterity because when you put your feet on the dome, your feet feel an adhesive and you are stuck to the dome. Yeah, I failed my dexterity roll. And you cannot release from this position. You are now hanging by your feet on the side of the dome. Okay.
2357.56 2368.86 speaker4  It is indeed.
2366.44 2390.26 speaker2  So you will roll a success there. What did I have you write down there for damage? G8 plus three. Roll that D8 for me, Lukey boy. That is a four total.
2386.18 2424.16 speaker4  It kind of like arcs through the air and then kind of like skids off him flying. Well, no, this was the saw blade. Whatever dude. So it leaves a big catch.
2416.84 2470.28 speaker2  he gets his boots back on, he stands up, clicks a button in his left hand and begins running toward Planet Juggernaut once again, hopefully this time in a successful manner. However, as he runs, a panel on the ground lifts up and flings him. He fails his roll. So he gets flung out of the air. He's just running and you see a panel on the floor just launch him and he flies into the dome and gets stuck like a spider in a web. No, spiders don't get stuck on webs. Like not a spider on a web.
2468.40 2483.34 speaker3  Wait.
2475.56 2597.08 speaker2  out into the audience, he sees moving past a crowd of allured, yelling, drunk assholes. He sees a very short young woman and a very tall old man, both wearing black suits, white shirts, black ties, black sunglasses, and ill-fitting windbreakers moving through this crowd of nonsensical monsters. Many, many, many faint woos as the crowd is going nuts because shit is getting crazy. Boy howdy. Right around we have Clark Bishop, ex-contention police officer, current monster and god thinker of himself. He just cannot get anything off today. His rocket launcher flew right off his back. You know what I have to think? What do you have to think, Nick? And Planet Juggernaut is doing something, ooh, boy howdy, he's got something up his proverbial arms. not last much longer. Any time we can get some humanity out of the robots in this world, I think we should go for it and praise them. We heard that's what he's wanting to do, and he finally got his feet all stucky sticky on the side of the dome.
2591.64 2602.48 speaker3  some of us think he might be, that would be a really classy move by a really classy guy.
2597.08 2614.74 speaker2  Yeah, we got OsmayHipWolf who's trying to make an attack with boots finally on his feet. He just gets flung right into the wall where he gets stuck like a spider on a web.
2613.12 2627.36 speaker3  his greatest fan today.
2625.68 2669.44 speaker2  Dick and Rich Nichols. of this massive dome room.
2668.44 2698.12 speaker1  Whoo! Both in silence!
2695.12 2720.38 speaker2  Let's get back to the action here in Route 4. What do you say, Dick? Clark Bishop, it's your turn.
2715.74 2741.04 speaker3  That trap that shot up and flung Oz, can I see, is it still up? to launch me onto Planet Juggernaut.
2739.54 2788.52 speaker2  Roll a dexterity check there, whoo! Just want to say, Dex Shepard, be like a, like a, like a thief. Yeah, like a rogue who's like a wheelman. What's a wheelman? Like the guy who drives cars. A wheelman! You know, like, some dudes are into legs and some are into butts. He's a real wheelman. He's a wheelman.
2786.52 2803.72 speaker4  Look at the muffler on that one. Oh my goodness gracious.
2799.96 2870.44 speaker3  gloves on and he knows where he's going to land so he kind of jumps onto that trap and it springs up and he flings himself straight at Planet Juggernaut hoping to land kind of on the top of him. And when he does, he's using those pneumatic gloves to kind of like punch inward and try and stabilize himself on the top of it. You know when a bodybuilder is like flexing their muscles, he's coming all the way up to the top and then half moons around the side and bam, right into the top dome area there. And I don't know what's inside it so explain to me what my hands pierce maybe. With the purpose of being stabilized on top of it, so I'm holding it kind of like maybe you would hold the horn on the saddle maybe?
2867.64 2883.72 speaker2  You have taken your time and you are ready to go.
2876.88 2907.28 speaker4  Juggernaut moving underneath him and he sees the secondary helicopter blade pop out and Planet Juggernaut rises off the ground and then it's weird. It's like the outside surface is spinning around something on the inside, but all of a sudden you're latched on and you're going down a roller coaster and it's spinning slow but then it starts going very fast and then Planet Juggernaut drops to the ground and
2905.56 2913.28 speaker2  takes off. You are going to roll, what did we say for this one?
2911.44 2922.68 speaker4  Did I give you a percentage? The 60 I think. I don't know, actually we didn't do a percentage, I figured maybe people would just try to dodge.
2919.08 2959.92 speaker2  I think it's just a dodge, so everybody is going to roll dodge. You do indeed and we'll start with you. That's not going to be good.
2958.24 2968.44 speaker4  Joe is going to take 8 points of damage.
2966.56 2971.56 speaker3  Yeah I'll use 10 more for one d6.
2970.56 2982.96 speaker2  4. Nice. Alright.
2979.40 2986.72 speaker4  I don't get any bonus from those legs since I'm stuck probably.
2985.20 3087.80 speaker2  So you are out. You're so stuck up. I will actually. I'm going to give you a plus 40% for being so far out of the way. Alright so on that success basically Planet Juggernaut like as he's rolling toward you realizes that he can't hit you with how high you are and so bails and goes after Oz Mayhem Wolf who rolls an 83 failing. So roll 3d6 for me Thomas. 12. Ouch. The ball starts rolling and Clark Bishop can't get his hands out from underneath it and it rolls over him and with the critical fail it continues to roll toward Oz Mayhem Wolf and as it rolls over Oz it splatters him. You actually see just viscera of guts and insides and this black ichor all just kind of like splurt out on either side and there is now a Nickelodeon style splat of dark red on Planet Juggernaut but because of the crit fail as he's continuing to roll Clark Bishop gets rolled over a second time. So I need you to roll 3d6 again. 6. 6 points of damage and you were at what?
3086.56 3094.96 speaker4  The mechanics.
3090.64 3109.44 speaker2  So you can either spend 10 luck to get a d6 more or you can roll a constitution check to see if you stay conscious or unconscious. If you fail the constitution check to stay conscious then you'll have to spend luck to stay conscious.
3105.24 3112.80 speaker3  It did yeah I am yeah I'm gonna use the d6.
3111.80 3114.60 speaker2  30.
3112.80 3154.56 speaker3  He's unable to save himself. 3 so I have 4 hit points total. You just hear from the crowd oh.
3153.16 3160.48 speaker2  Keith Vigna it's your turn.
3159.48 3194.02 speaker4  Rolling around baby. Doing a couple victory laps. of the dome so what do I roll to do that dexterity? to where I'm like kind of overlooking the dome from above yeah yeah what do I need to
3193.02 3210.74 speaker2  this dome.
3207.34 3216.30 speaker4  That's a crit success 22 on a 70.
3211.74 3246.84 speaker2  Okay you're like technically already dodging because you're rolling around so go ahead and roll if you can critically succeed what was your crit success? 22. And it's impossible for you to win but go ahead and roll anyway. I know I did roll. Your no was a sign of failure not a refusal to roll I hear you loud and clear. That is an 8 plus 3 that's 11.
3240.12 3284.78 speaker4  Okay with a critical success yeah dude you're gonna roll that 8 again 11 plus 11 plus 3 and the force of him coming at me meet and the saw goes inside of juggernaut.
3279.16 3412.76 speaker2  here we have clark bishop he goes ahead and just jumps and makes a big ol punch with hulk Planet juggernaut you know he took his time last round to really save up something special for us this time. using the saw blade shooter at his vast disposal while stuck on the side of the dome shepherd
3408.64 3427.92 speaker3  about planet juggernaut is that he keeps all the leftover teeth from all the matches and sleeps on a big pile of them that's what I hear it's important to have a legend behind
3423.56 3444.20 speaker4  body of planet juggernaut and like sucking out the teeth that are stuck to him from oz
3436.76 3493.16 speaker2  down to our medical correspondent to talk about that brutal take to oz mayhem wolf joe
3489.80 3493.16 speaker0  he got squashed back to you you
