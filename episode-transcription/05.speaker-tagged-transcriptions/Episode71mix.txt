Time is weird, time is like jazz. It's all made up, and no one fuckin' understands it. Speaking of things I don't understand and I'm forced to do, this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Brittany Roxanne, who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod. Seriously, what a pleasant thing to do, they write, I have an urgent message for Hurt Ork. Your message is simple, infiltrate the enemy, gather intel, and report back what you find. If your cover's blown, do not, under any circumstances, contact us. I hope Hurt Ork accomplishes whatever the mission was, unless that mission is to infiltrate my home and gather intel on little ol' me? Hey, producer, beef up the security around here, you salty salt dog. Hey, do you like this show? Do you wanna help this show? Do you even think we deserve it? Let the congregation say amen, an elf, a dwarf, and a wizard. Blessed are the measures that light the fuse, let's erupt the oppressors and we'll write the news. the pit of their elbows. Hmm, elbows, the knees of the arms.
146.06 171.82 speaker1  comes up again. Seriously, he just thought Justin succeeded that check for some reason. Hmm, he must've been all nervous and shit. What a dumb motherfucker. Anyway, Martin twisted his ankle in the go bag hiding place he had previously covered up and he found the go bag was missing.
166.58 304.42 speaker0  He also cannot remember arriving here at calm, comfy campground. Charles Digby had a knock at the door. calling her Ann. Hmm, nothing suspicious there. Inside tensions rose. Walter tried to turn himself off after Martin violated his personal space. the right kind of wrong. It's Dream Girl, my babies, with Pretty Sexual. This is real, I dream I knew I'd make you be foolish
297.66 422.82 speaker2  made to feel even smaller because it is filled with flowers. So many flowers of all different varieties, shades and shapes that you've never seen before. Sitting right in front of you is James, the executive director of Calm Comfy Campground sitting behind a desk and he has a folder in front of him and he looks up at you. at a negative 40. Well 80, so I failed that, but I also didn't have much chance, I have a 55, so. Oh shit, yeah, that would have been rough. feel docile almost, you feel so pliant. Well I mean, I'm not supposed to talk about Cube, but I'll let you in on a little secret, yeah, you can know about Cube before the rest of the world, basically Cube is just a really expensive personal computer, looks like a jellybean, obviously modeled pretty heavily on the iMac, which was the thing in the late 90s. Really it's just all marketing baby, that's all Cube is. like 48.5 seconds, that's of course rising exponentially with global population, but population of western nations are plummeting and the markets aren't there yet in the developing nations, there's just not going to be as many fools per capita to sell to, you really want to get in right now.
421.82 424.78 speaker3  Well consider-
422.82 455.92 speaker2  On the verge of this new gilded age. You want to buy a Cube? He flips open the folder and there's a thick stack of documents in there.
450.54 496.50 speaker3  And inside there's document after document after document and he hands you a pen and he needs you to sign at the bottom of every page. It's the worst. Oh no.
495.50 507.50 speaker1  Oh my god.
501.54 570.12 speaker3  You always say roll for me, which is like, seems a little bit like self-aggrandizing. You were in the meeting room a second ago, wait, you're sitting in this room. It's small. It's made to feel even smaller by the overwhelming amount of flowers in this room. Sitting across from you at a desk is James, the executive director of Calm Comfy Campground. He's looking through a folder and he looks up at you and these flowers that are all around All different kinds of colors, all different kinds of shapes, varied in many different Part of your job? Is that correct?
569.12 572.62 speaker1  We know who.
570.12 614.06 speaker3  And he's flipping through this folder. You immediately list the people.
610.30 617.06 speaker1  a radio DJ, there was a city council member. All right, all right. Calm down.
616.06 662.58 speaker3  Calm down. I know. It's okay, Charles. Why? You're working with us now. I need you to sign these here documents. We're working together now as a team and we're going to need those pictures. it. And then he flips it open and there is a thick stack of documents there. All right. If you'll just sign and initial all these. I'm doing it. All right. Thank you for your time. Thank you.
661.58 673.78 speaker1  I don't like where the-
668.94 713.26 speaker3  Walter just like goes to punch, wait, no, you're sitting in this room. It's a small room and you're surrounded by flowers of every shape and shade. They're the exact same flowers you've been seeing all over this island, but you're not sure if this is a memory. It feels like a memory. It's a small room, but it's even smaller because of how many flowers are just surrounding you in every direction. And in front of you, there's a desk and behind that desk is James, executive director of the calm comfy campground.
710.02 717.14 speaker2  43 on what would be a 30.
716.14 746.46 speaker3  Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. Well, basically today we're just here to sign some paperwork so that our partnership can continue. Yeah.
745.46 752.98 speaker2  Yeah, of course.
750.54 848.90 speaker3  the front says operation hole puncher. I do. And he looks up and he's like, look forward to working more with you. And then all of a sudden you're just standing in this room. Next to you is Alan Grimes, who you know as your handler. And in front of him is a desk. Behind that desk is James, executive director at Calm Comfy Campground. This room is filled with flowers of all different shade and shape. It's the exact same flowers that are covering the Island where calm comfy campground sits and you are completely docile. So Alan, you're saying that you've got more of these. Yes. I've got, we have warehouses in Washington. We have warehouses in Chicago, new Orleans, Las Vegas. We have access to as many as you need. Well, that is, that is something else and they'll just do whatever they'll just do whatever you want.
845.24 849.90 speaker2  Luke touches his nose immediately, but Walter touches his nose.
848.90 851.90 speaker3  Oh damn.
850.90 855.18 speaker2  Slap your face.
854.18 857.18 speaker3  Yeah.
856.18 870.38 speaker2  He slaps his face. Man.
864.16 888.18 speaker3  Let's sign some paperwork and Alan Grimes approaches the desk where James has a folder that's labeled operation hole puncher. And inside there's a bunch of paperwork. Alan just signs and signs and initials and signs.
887.18 903.18 speaker2  Thank you.
900.18 915.18 speaker1  Let's clank a couple. That's what my mom tells me. It's a real fucking bummer.
914.18 917.22 speaker0  It's okay.
916.22 920.22 speaker1  It's okay.
918.22 924.22 speaker2  So in our last alone session, was the minotaur speaking English?
923.22 937.22 speaker1  I remember that.
931.22 945.26 speaker3  Like you just got punched in the throat and everyone's eyes just kind of cross each other.
944.26 963.26 speaker2  You little bastard. Cool.
962.26 969.26 speaker3  All right.
966.26 991.30 speaker1  Somebody punch him again. He touched me. He did touch you. That's true. Are you okay, Brad? I like walk over to him. I kind of. No.
990.30 1004.34 speaker2  I hate this fucking kid. I hate this calm, cozy campground. I'm leaving immediately. I'm gone. I want a refund. Where's James?
1001.34 1018.34 speaker1  I just had a, was it a memory? Was that a flashback or a dream?
1016.34 1032.38 speaker3  I am so sorry, Walter. I don't know what that was.
1030.38 1037.38 speaker1  Were you guys in that room? It was the flowers all around the island.
1034.38 1059.38 speaker2  That's kind of an old trick. We'd do it in the waiting room when we had to renegotiate contracts. You fill it all with flowers so it looks like people really care about you and are thinking about you. I pegged it right away.
1057.38 1064.42 speaker1  It made the room feel smaller.
1062.42 1067.42 speaker2  That's really the play there. At least it was with us.
1066.42 1093.46 speaker1  I think we need to find James. So I'm probably heading toward that door anyway.
1087.46 1132.50 speaker3  which you haven't seen before, but it is the calm, comfy campground staff uniform. And it is like a one-piece jumpsuit with a collar that goes all the way up buttoned to the top. It is a tall broad woman and a short scrawny man. And they both have spray bottles in their hands. Who the fuck are these boners? which is Roger Fairfield and Bradley Cooper. Can I athletics away? Yeah, you can absolutely try.
1131.50 1145.50 speaker1  Yeah.
1143.50 1159.54 speaker3  but something about seeing these bottles... Oh, hell yeah. How do you get out of the way? I just straight up like Neo.
1151.54 1174.54 speaker2  The Matrix hasn't come out yet, so it's really innovative and revolutionary and shockingly cinematic. and I want to try to grab the spray out of his hands.
1170.54 1204.62 speaker3  Bradley Cooper, Charles Digby, Walter and Ellen Grimes, and Roger Fairfield, you are all standing together in a cottage. It is familiar because the setup is the same as the cottage each of you have been staying in. However, this cottage is filled with surveillance equipment. the insides of Cottages 3, 5, 7, and 9, as well as, it seems, the forests that surround Lake Calm. Do I still have the bottle in my hand?
1203.62 1214.62 speaker1  Everybody roll alertness. Fuck, I fail also. Ooh, great success.
1213.62 1232.62 speaker2  Ooh, nice. Can I see if anybody else still has that?
1228.62 1243.66 speaker3  If they'll show you their arms under their sleeves.
1242.66 1248.66 speaker2  It does.
1243.66 1272.70 speaker3  And because you Chris Exceed, you actually will see on the surveillance footage. and you see there is a tall, broad woman and a short, scrawny man, both with a bottle in their hand, heading toward a cottage, which you innately feel is this cottage.
1270.70 1284.70 speaker2  We can set an ambush for him, boys. Sure. Do we see that on the surveillance? No.
1283.70 1287.74 speaker1  No. Oh.
1285.74 1293.74 speaker2  Which cottage do you think we're in? Probably the one that was tinted.
1292.74 1294.74 speaker3  Which one was tinted?
1293.74 1309.74 speaker2  Five was me, right? Yes. And seven. Yeah.
1305.74 1314.74 speaker1  So is it before it was tinted or after it was tinted and then taken down?
1313.74 1317.78 speaker2  We can see them coming.
1316.78 1329.78 speaker1  They're going to subdue us.
1326.78 1360.82 speaker2  investigate any further on that awesome roll I got. Wait. Don't just greet them. Run to the door. Tell them to get in quick. Tell them there's an emergency.
1358.82 1386.86 speaker1  So like cording or roping. Like zip ties? Is that what you mean? Okay.
1380.86 1405.90 speaker2  Are there any big, uh, calm, cozy comforters like on the couch, like big knit, uh, there's heads. Everybody grabs a monitor. How heavy are the monitors? Yeah. They're just all over the place. Yeah.
1404.90 1417.90 speaker3  And like stacked on top of each other and shit. I look at Martin. Do I go now?
1415.90 1430.90 speaker2  I run out the front door. How far away are they?
1429.90 1436.94 speaker3  Yeah. In the face. Like immediately. As soon as they walk up to you.
1434.94 1447.94 speaker2  What do we see happen as we're holding our monitors? Yeah.
1443.94 1452.94 speaker3  his chin goes down to his chest and he just stops moving.
1451.94 1459.94 speaker2  In. Well, yeah. I just want to wait for them to come through the door and then we all check our monitors at them, at their head.
1458.94 1461.98 speaker1  him?
1460.98 1470.98 speaker3  Yeah. They just keep moving. And, uh, everyone roll humid. Me too or? Pass. 37 on a 60.
1469.98 1482.98 speaker2  Pass.
1479.98 1503.02 speaker3  There is just a blank expression. Look, they're drone people. Clobber.
1502.02 1508.02 speaker1  I'll try. I'll try. Martin. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not a fighter. I'm not a fighter.
1507.02 1510.02 speaker0  I'm not a fighter. Hey, hey, hey.
1509.02 1524.26 speaker1  Pull yourself to fucking gather, man. He's going to go kind of toward the back of the room, but be ready to throw. While they were also searching, is there like a gun on any of the desks nearby or anything like that? No.
1519.58 1549.66 speaker3  But you guys can, if you're all doing the monitor gig, I'd like to do a wield monitors. You would take no advantage, but the other two can have a plus 20.
1548.66 1551.66 speaker0  Yeah.
1550.66 1557.70 speaker3  Okay.
1556.70 1606.18 speaker2  Yeah. Okay. So you're fucked either way. Well, what did you roll? I rolled a 57 and my skill is 65. So if we're doing highest without going over, I completely smashed two monitors on both your fucking heads. Yes, absolutely. If it's a crit. You just keep inventing conditions in which I can lose.
1603.54 1607.42 speaker3  We'll say the tall woman who is extremely bright.
1606.18 1616.86 speaker2  You were rolling for them. These aren't my rules.
1613.66 1622.62 speaker3  So you describe how one of them goes down.
1621.18 1648.34 speaker2  right in their face. They don't even see it coming, just like full fucking glass to the face. They go down. But that was my right hand and I'm not as good with my left hand. And so the person immediately behind them has a little time to like see it and duck and it's not as like strong or good a throw.
1646.58 1649.34 speaker3  And then we got a successor fail over here.
1648.34 1652.06 speaker1  Fail 93. Okay, fantastic.
1651.06 1658.10 speaker3  All right. So the other one is going to...
1654.50 1666.20 speaker1  Can we just throw our monitors up into the air? Yikes!
1660.10 1683.30 speaker3  Immediately horrified, the little scrawny guy was not expecting this and he, still, no scream, no holler, no anything. And he just holds up his spray bottle and begins spraying and running toward you guys.
1681.46 1685.62 speaker1  Can I do something to avoid that now?
1684.30 1700.78 speaker3  So this will be another contested roll. He's coming after the room. You guys are all like right there in the front. What are we rolling? Athletics or dexterity. Okay, let me try rolling again. Or dodge. And you roll the... 83.
1699.78 1706.54 speaker2  Not a good fail.
1703.78 1714.58 speaker1  Do I get any bonuses to this one? No, you do not. I got a 53 on a 50.
1712.70 1719.26 speaker3  He actually also failed. Not a crypto.
1718.26 1720.26 speaker2  He does.
1719.26 1749.18 speaker3  He sprays himself. So literally what happened is he's spraying as he's walking and you guys all just like walk into rooms and he's just like walking down the hallway with his arm out flat just spraying it forward and then he's going to turn around and he's going to change the bottle into his other hand and then spray and just walk down the hallway the other way. Back out the door. He's heading back through the hallway.
1748.18 1771.38 speaker1  Corner us. Yeah. Yeah. Whatever room I've ended up in now, can I see if there's a window that I could break out? Oh yeah, for sure. Or open it. I got to get out of here. I'm going to slam my head through it. The glass hurts so bad. It's all worth it. Open it.
1770.38 1772.38 speaker2  Yeah.
1771.38 1789.66 speaker1  You open the window. Okay. I'm going to crawl out. Okay. Sounds good. Yeah.
1786.90 1807.64 speaker3  There's actually a... Help me out here guys. A tripod. What would... What could he use? No, something far more. No, there's a... A keyboard. Fuck.
1806.64 1823.12 speaker1  There's a snowshoe. An old fishing pole.
1820.78 1838.36 speaker2  Bazookas and grenades and land mines. It's one of those things on the wall with the pinned insects on it. There's a bigger spray bottle.
1837.36 1842.36 speaker1  Ooh, that one. That one, yeah. That one.
1841.36 1855.48 speaker3  There's a taxidermied frog holding a banjo.
1853.08 1861.56 speaker2  That's some quality folk art.
1860.56 1864.56 speaker1  on him. Yeah, absolutely. You got it.
1863.56 1866.56 speaker3  Okay.
1865.56 1882.24 speaker2  Does the door open in or out of this room? There's no door. Oh. What kind of taxidermy is in my room?
1881.24 1885.40 speaker1  Yes.
1884.40 1906.32 speaker2  A long reed. I pluck the reed and I start chewing on it.
1903.40 1911.34 speaker1  When you say hold it like a baseball bat, are you holding it by the head and its feet are standing up?
1908.32 1922.78 speaker2  I'm holding it by the feet and its head is the club end. And I imagine its arms are doing kind of cute things. So those are kind of like little spikes coming out from it.
1921.66 1927.66 speaker1  At least.
1922.78 1932.42 speaker3  He won't see either one of these attacks coming, so you guys can both roll with a plus 20 and
1930.66 1935.26 speaker1  Both of you at the same time.
1934.26 1952.34 speaker2  You can roll- Oh, this would be not- Plus 20? Yeah. Okay, I have a 50. I rolled a 52, but I have a plus 20, so limo.
1951.34 1956.44 speaker1  97.
1954.94 1978.94 speaker3  Oh, thank God. You swing right over this. He's a very short fella and you were expecting the tall broad woman, right?
1974.02 2008.46 speaker2  this motherfucker right in his face with the raccoon teeth pointed out.
2001.74 2011.62 speaker3  is actually stretched fully out and you still are holding on to the other end and if you kind of like-
2009.46 2046.78 speaker2  Yeah, I try to get my raccoon loose. out into the room to do all that, so Justin just sees me in the process of becoming fully nude.
2045.78 2063.40 speaker1  Oh, okay. Can I go find the woman's clothes and change into them?
2057.62 2089.82 speaker3  you're standing in the meeting room for where you had orientation and you're looking over the spray bottle that you have in your hand. I think you can call me my real name now. Oh, Martin Cupertino. Who? Oh. Looking down at this spray bottle and as you're holding it-
2088.82 2114.46 speaker1  It makes sense. Cupertino? Yeah. Garden? Billionaire. Oh. That's what I thought you were saying.
2113.46 2117.46 speaker3  There was a... Uh, no.
2116.46 2136.02 speaker1  Who?
2126.54 2172.50 speaker3  written on the piece of tape is the word Sanfera Blom, S-A-N-F-E-R-R-A space B-L-O-M. Sanfera Blom. me. Yes. And Martin Cupertino, you smell this bottle like it is pungent and you can smell. It's the exact same smell of the flowers that are all over this island.
2169.82 2175.72 speaker1  Can I remember details about what I read about it?
2174.72 2191.14 speaker2  Shut up. Shut up. Remember all the flowers blooming in the city.
2190.14 2193.14 speaker1  Yeah.
2192.14 2219.14 speaker2  Interesting. I'm just going to... Yeah. Zach owes me a debit of five luck.
2213.26 2250.70 speaker3  you are all in this meeting room with the walls that round off at all the corners. And there is these two people, this tall broad woman and this short scrawny man are both on the ground and you're holding one of the bottles and the other bottle is across the floor and it's been opened and it is just like in the corner. It's spilling out of the room.
2249.70 2263.18 speaker1  Yeah. We'll see. Okay. Hey, Angela. Hey, Raj.
2262.18 2268.26 speaker3  This is crazy. We need to get the fuck out of this room. I feel like I was just coming to see you.
2267.26 2276.10 speaker1  Yeah. I think we got to get out of here.
2275.10 2299.14 speaker3  Real quick. What are the Grimes doing and what is Charles Digby doing?
2298.14 2301.30 speaker2  Okay.
2300.14 2311.82 speaker1  I think I'm going to book it with Martin.
2306.06 2329.78 speaker3  short stout man, and he's like, we need to get the fuck out of here immediately. Are you kidding me? What? I think you got him. You got him.
2326.58 2334.82 speaker2  If you're with them, I'm going to spray your ass down right now.
2333.82 2338.82 speaker3  him. I'm trying to- I believe you.
2337.82 2351.98 speaker2  You didn't have a bag, really.
2350.42 2353.70 speaker1  I put my hand in the hole.
2351.98 2364.02 speaker2  Do you have the syringe? Check your pockets. See what you brought with you.
2363.02 2372.02 speaker1  Oh, yep, there it is. Ow! Say ow again. I check my pockets.
2371.02 2389.68 speaker4  Yeah, I have it.
2383.98 2438.54 speaker3  Those people are blank, and when they fell, they just kind of stayed down. But when you look over at them now, they're slowly getting back up with just a look of nothing on their faces. in cottage number 11. So they're both on the ground, and they both put their palms on the ground- In a weird way? Like people do? And then slowly move their feet up toward their palms.
2437.54 2479.74 speaker2  Oh, okay. So just like a normal person would. Exactly. Doing yoga in front of us. And it looks exactly like how a human looks. on the ground, I want to get behind him and put my hand under his jaw and try to rip. As if maybe it's a removable face. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2478.74 2502.74 speaker4  No, I get it. Exactly.
2499.98 2521.86 speaker3  slowly move it away from his face. And he turns around to face you. And he holds up his hand like he has a spray bottle in it, but he doesn't. And he's trying to like moving his fingers like he's spraying you in the face.
2518.86 2523.70 speaker2  I have a 55 now.
2522.70 2524.70 speaker4  Whoa.
2523.70 2548.98 speaker2  I don't... Why not? Zach, I would like that too.
2545.90 2571.20 speaker3  All right, so what does everyone know? I mean, these two aren't going to be an issue, right? And so, and then he looks up and his eyes cross Angela's and his eyes get really big and he's like... I'm so sorry.
2569.78 2579.70 speaker2  like font. And it says, what did you touch?
2578.30 2588.70 speaker4  What did you touch? What did you touch?
2587.70 2601.86 speaker1  What did you touch, honey? What did you touch?
2597.14 2617.62 speaker3  And she begins backing away slowly from everyone. I'm confused though. Is everyone cool here? What has happened? Are you guys good? Yeah, we're cool. Are you cool?
2615.62 2622.58 speaker2  I feel like we never got to the bottom of that.
2621.58 2638.86 speaker3  Yeah, it's no big deal. Will you pass me a J? Is this the time? And she just reaches into her little clutch and throws you a joint.
2637.86 2662.54 speaker2  The classics. Yep. Okay. I passed my human troll.
2658.14 2681.10 speaker3  Charles Digby, you know that she is extremely nervous and confused. Okay.
2680.10 2685.10 speaker2  Out of character. Out of character.
2684.10 2691.58 speaker3  Yeah, in character. What the fuck is going on? What are you guys talking about when you're in the cab? We've just been waiting for James.
2690.58 2699.82 speaker2  Waiting for James. Is that all you think you've done here?
2698.10 2710.06 speaker1  I was going to come and get you, and then you... Yeah, we're going to run.
2708.38 2713.18 speaker2  You can come with us if you want. We're going with Jack Russell.
2712.18 2723.98 speaker1  Yeah, yeah. Wait, but you said we were waiting for James to come in. That means that maybe he's coming.
2722.98 2725.14 speaker2  Roger, come.
2723.98 2736.70 speaker1  We need to go now. And I grab him. go. Honey, come on. We should follow them.
2735.02 2741.86 speaker3  Why are we leaving? There's something wrong.
2739.70 2754.54 speaker1  They're spray bottles, and they're...
2748.46 2793.98 speaker3  Alan Grimes, and Roger Fairfield, you are all sitting in a half circle facing a single empty chair in the meeting room where you had orientation. Everyone roll Constitution. Except for Bradley, who crit. Okay, everyone take your headphones off except for Justin. Yay. all of these confusing plot points like you just got here and everything's normal. Cool.
2792.98 2795.98 speaker1  So like I just first arrived?
2793.98 2802.74 speaker3  Yeah, like you're fresh and ready to go. Right, okay.
2799.62 2812.86 speaker2  It's weird how well that works. The listener can't see us, but usually we go out of the room when it's short, Zach just has us take our headphones off and then we just like press our ears.
2811.86 2814.86 speaker4  Ear flap? What do you call that part?
2813.86 2815.86 speaker2  Yeah, right.
2814.86 2818.86 speaker1  It has a name.
2817.86 2827.18 speaker2  Tragus. A tragus. Ear anatomy.
2825.98 2831.98 speaker4  Oh, okay. Can you guys? Yeah, I know what you're talking about. Ear rumble?
2830.98 2834.06 speaker2  Oh, the ear rumble, yeah.
2832.22 2845.66 speaker4  I didn't know everybody couldn't do that. I think most people can because- It's called the tragus.
2844.66 2851.02 speaker3  Thanks.
2848.66 2879.58 speaker2  You can't tell because I have headphones on. Did you actually in the past get your tragus? No, I've never had anything pierced. Anything? My PA, I've got a Prince Albert, but that's it.
2877.58 2887.62 speaker4  It would be your dingus. I don't know what I would get. Your dingus. We'll think about it later.
2886.58 2893.94 speaker3  It's just you guys. The spray bottles aren't in here, the two people aren't in here.
2892.10 2910.82 speaker1  How's our memory working right now? Do we remember spray bottle guys in the room? Angela wanted us to get better, yeah.
2909.82 2914.82 speaker2  What are you so- What?
2913.82 2919.14 speaker1  I'm not talking about an agenda.
2918.14 2924.82 speaker2  Don't you remember? What's going on? Do you not remember?
2923.82 2930.94 speaker3  But it was different. Right? Am I fucking losing my mind here? I remember that. Yeah.
2929.94 2934.94 speaker1  No, this is my- I just got here. And this is like our orientation, isn't it?
2933.94 2941.26 speaker2  Oh, damn it, Digby. Did they spray you? I'm Martin Cupertino. I'm a Silicon Valley billionaire.
2939.58 2951.58 speaker1  Oh, I read about you. Yeah. Definitely not taking pictures of people like you before.
2950.58 2955.58 speaker2  You? Okay.
2954.58 2965.34 speaker3  Well, this young kid- I contest. Unarmed combat.
2964.34 2971.34 speaker4  Oh, shit. Fuck. 41 on a 60. Oh, wait.
2970.34 2974.34 speaker1  I thought it was below. You rip his face off. Yeah.
2973.34 2989.18 speaker4  I kill him.
2987.50 2999.50 speaker3  how he combats that.
2993.78 3004.58 speaker2  straight up, walk right over to him, and with just my pointer finger and thumb right behind
3002.26 3024.86 speaker3  So at this point in time, what's Charles Digby doing? I don't think we can trust him.
3021.46 3033.54 speaker1  I've never met you guys until today. Have we already done the true truths and a lie in this room?
3030.42 3041.98 speaker3  Of course we have, but we've also done a lot of other ... Do you remember when there were spray bottles? The spray bottle thing?
3038.34 3050.18 speaker1  I'm a little ... Maybe I need to go talk to James. Father, I'm confused.
3049.18 3054.18 speaker3  I say, sorry.
3050.18 3068.86 speaker2  I'm trying to tackle you now. He's trying to tackle you.
3067.86 3073.86 speaker1  or something. Yeah. So it just happens. Yeah.
3072.86 3076.98 speaker3  Yeah.
3075.82 3099.76 speaker2  What's your body look like? Average. It feels like an average. Average sort of tackle. It doesn't feel like the NFL or anything. That's good. It's small compared to that because he's average.
3098.76 3105.88 speaker3  Role intelligence.
3102.76 3123.96 speaker1  A 78 on a 75. It was weird. It was like a chanting kind of thing. Have you ever heard that before? Have I never heard her do that before?
3121.96 3151.16 speaker3  I don't know you. Yeah.
3150.16 3152.48 speaker2  And she's probably not your wife.
3151.16 3162.68 speaker1  Is she not here with us right now? No. Is Martin on top of me while this is happening? That keeps happening. Yeah, I'm on top.
3161.68 3168.76 speaker3  you were lying flat. He's just admitted.
3167.76 3181.16 speaker1  I'm sad. Oh, yeah. I like getting sat on. That's why I'm here.
3180.16 3196.88 speaker2  You can.
3195.88 3200.88 speaker4  Yeah. So maybe that's exactly what it is.
3199.88 3212.28 speaker2  No.
3211.28 3213.28 speaker1  like-
3212.28 3214.28 speaker2  Yeah, I've got you pinned, I think.
3213.28 3220.28 speaker1  I've got you. Yeah. Can I try and, is there like a struggle mechanic? Yeah.
3219.28 3223.28 speaker3  Oh, okay. Yeah.
3222.28 3255.20 speaker2  You do. I'm like- 46 on a modified 90. Yeah. No, like with no apparent effort. Yeah. I've just got him pinned. Comfortably in a pressure lock. And I'm still just turned around like, you know your wife's not real, right? Half the time she's not even here.
3252.82 3263.08 speaker1  of my muscles are moving.
3260.28 3265.84 speaker2  to calm you down like a pig or something. Now I'm more confused.
3264.84 3269.84 speaker1  I'm like, what?
3268.04 3289.40 speaker2  I'll just squeeze you. Calm me down. Okay. I feel you just like touch my chin. I'm like, what the fuck?
3288.40 3302.88 speaker1  She's my wife. I don't understand. I don't understand how she wouldn't be-
3300.60 3317.68 speaker2  Her eyes get really big. Yeah. Uh, fail. Yeah. 85 on a 60. I don't understand the line of questioning, honey.
3316.68 3324.52 speaker1  Where's this going, Martin? Come on, man. She's never here.
3323.52 3332.88 speaker3  Martin?
3331.88 3339.60 speaker4  That's right.
3337.48 3349.00 speaker1  Go get James and get me out of here. What's happening right now? I didn't come here to be treated like this. This is supposed to be a nice calm- Oh, that's right.
3348.00 3414.04 speaker3  Angela. She takes one step back and shuts the door and she's on the other side of it.
3409.04 3440.04 speaker4  I'm tired of coming. I think that you could fall. I knew I'd make you believe. Cooler than you could lose me. Yeah.
