Yes I I thought I just solved all the problems. Yeah, like like I thought the game is over like I fixed it
549.72 575.96 speaker2  I wouldn't leave a boy's corpse or a Bigfoot foot or
570.52 637.60 speaker4  She was fumbling like crazy, but then Chuck steps in Chuck like the most underrated character Miller, you know, she thought he was like a buffoon. Maybe I'll get a real purple heart now. Yeah
629.92 652.48 speaker3  Yeah, could I get like an honorary diploma or something to be a doctor they do that that's who are you asking the government
646.40 660.56 speaker4  Put a hand on his shoulder to be like that was absolutely amazing Chuck or I shall call you Charles
658.56 681.96 speaker3  I'm getting from this other woman
679.96 690.68 speaker2  Yeah, it's a whippet
688.68 733.94 speaker4  Play with small town folk You So she's like we need to clean this up though, and we need to figure out what the hell is going on in there in
730.22 773.08 speaker3  Would be important. I connect my phone to the Bluetooth and play tick by big homie G Just cuz I think she might be bored
769.78 936.14 speaker2  Yeah, I I like morphine Just like rushes through your bloodstream and you feel better than you've ever felt about anything in your entire life You're not sure whether you just pissed your pants, but you don't I don't care Oh, I'm not like an addict I fell through a plate glass window and almost died. It's no big deal. Jeez Of glass that was stuck in my butt They hit another artery and I had to have a second blood transfusion Doctor told me I might not be able to ever walk again, but look at me now motherfuckers not walking not walking but I just kept looking at the nurse and being like Your job is so weird Rusty Hooch and Jerome Dyer finishing up wiping all traces electronic or physical of both the corpse and Freshly powdered ground behind the sprinter van as snow is falling I mean for a second you thought you heard it's the most wonderful time of the year but then it leans pretty hard into a file and rap
934.14 976.42 speaker3  Know there's not much I can do So I decide I'm gonna go out to the van and try to switch places with Chuck
973.06 996.28 speaker2  Like shrugs at the camera like fucking Jim Halpert
992.36 1175.08 speaker3  Take it in stride and I say girl. I know this is just your Insecurity is trying to come out for a boy Cuz you know that you want this duck Admit it I turn around and I just like hock a loogie onto the ground because that's the most disgusting thing And then I do like I do the thing we're like you squeeze one peck at a time and they kind of bounce oh Zero percent in straightness. Sorry Chuck I don't know what the fuck is going on, but we've got two civilians inside I've destroyed all the evidence but we've got to get rid of them Can I can you go inside and take care of that and while while I'm talking to her? I'm looking over and noticing that Doreen is missing a foot And I pull a foot out of my I can hop. All right, I figured it out girl. I put the foot in the deep freeze Chuck stayed stay right where you are sit on the ground. Don't move a fucking muscle is Chuck still in their hazmat suit Detaches, but let it be known when he grabbed the foot and put it in the deep freeze. He had his hazmat suit Okay, it's in the deep freeze if we try to kill it that little alien bugs gonna come out again So I say we just leave it there forever. I think I've got a fucking get rid of this deep freeze
1169.36 1197.84 speaker2  Location in each of your phones for a drop-off warehouse where you're going to bring this body It would be also a great place to bring a foot. Yeah. Yes Although they might get angry at you at the warehouse if you haven't cleaned up everything before you get there. Yeah
1192.04 1242.00 speaker4  Well, I think dr. Miller is gonna I think she's gonna suggest that that's exactly what they do of like cleaning up everything trying to get the body into a Secure sort of body bag and then she's gonna try to talk to Carl and Ruth as they wake up Listen, you've been through a lot We understand that this must be extremely traumatic. There are help I mean and she's gonna lie because she doesn't know if there's help She's got there's help for you waiting and we're gonna be taking care of you I suggest that you don't tell anyone what you've seen here and what you've done here But before you talk to your legal counsel, and she knows that there's probably nothing waiting for these people. She's lying Because that's her job
1240.76 1377.32 speaker2  I think I think Honestly, I'm not gonna have you roll cuz with everything that's happened so far and Jerome is is there and he's known these people for Three years they trust him They don't know what the fuck is going on. So they're very confused We could have a quick montage of the cleanup of the site You grab a body bag from the sprinter van kind of fold the tarp over the pool table over this boy's corpse And gently lift it with all of its blood and everything dripping Into this body bag and you can kind of get it in there seal it up and you can take that out And get it on the stretcher in the back of this this sprinter van You said there's a place that we can go. Do you have a
1374.40 1385.36 speaker4  Yes, we have the coordinates Chuck will drive the other car
1383.76 1440.74 speaker3  Was it my right foot? Come on Well, that wouldn't be my voice Rusty who'd you letting this happen? I? Damn Yeah, I'm gonna let you drive bitch
1436.04 1613.80 speaker2  Everything any evidence you've cleaned up. I need whoever who has the highest forensics So it's 30. So who had the 40? Okay. So yeah, and that makes sense. She's been cleaning up Anyway, that was like her whole situation inside this this this little cabin shack thing lean to a huge lean to with the toilet Can you can you roll forensics for me? And so you guys are going to head on out It is just biting your noses as you pack up everything into the sprinter van and into one of the trucks that is on this site Jerome's truck is here and They're gonna hop into that one. You see a Older and like lifted and souped up It says bush on the side of it with a bullet hole for the period after each letter You're pretty sure that one's Carl's Yeah, Jerome's just got a nice like f-250 or something like that with four doors. So it's got the extended I don't know why I'm getting so into these fucking trucks. It doesn't matter you get into the trucks Jerome driving and you've got Carl and Janice in the backseat kind of smushed together in the backseat and And Yeah, it's just memes guys. So You drive down the long gravel driveway to get out Jerome hits a like a garage door opener that opens the gate for the sprinter van that's in the lead and Doreen puts her one good foot to the pedal which is much easier now that Jerome Dyer has Kind of released the cellular grip that he had on this area. And so you all have full bars again obviously, dr. Hooch's phone starts blowing up and
1610.80 1617.56 speaker3  I'm never gonna say no to her but I do think it's smart to
1614.56 1648.92 speaker2  Check out the road as we go. I think that's really smart Like y'all are just like especially in Doreen's loosened lucid lucidity
1644.44 1688.04 speaker3  Party and then I pull out a beer and I'm like, I'm catching up and then I crack it I just remember that she has refrigerated pants and I have unrefrigerated Asked Chuck if he will store my loose Mentos in his refrigerated pockets, please Yeah, we could do that, but it could probably get a lot pulled a lot faster in the deep freeze
1684.88 1709.64 speaker2  Sentence the camera pans back through to see dr Rusty hooch just like staring at this deep freeze and we see this body bag is sitting on the stretcher
1703.48 1724.84 speaker3  Immediately realized that I don't trust them. I don't trust that they inspected this foot. So I open up the freezer
1720.12 1805.52 speaker2  onto the windshield of the truck driving behind and we see Jerome Dyer and Dr. Miller having a conversation in the front Though it is silent for some time. I would assume in this truck before Jerome's finally like The camera you Jerome reaches for the rearview mirror and adjusts it to see Carl with his head like slung back Still just knocked out cold because Ali hasn't snapped your fingers yet I Just trusted him I believed his story and I knew that they were onto something and I knew that I needed to be here for when it happened and
1803.52 1823.52 speaker4  Here have one of these and she picks out Some sort of pill that will make her probably at least try to cool her nerves Not as strong as the whatever potion that pooch made but something that to just have her not listening on us and calm down
1821.72 1855.44 speaker2  silence in the car You look back Janice is like over with her head on Carl's shoulder Janice Ruth with the most like deviated septum of all time
1850.84 1887.76 speaker4  It's just that it never is, you know, it's never it's never religion behind it It's never you know, one of these stories. It's just stories that people come up with to explain whatever it is, but The truth is always darker. I found We're dressed in red. You wouldn't assume that it's Santa. It's always, you know some alien or some Disgusting pedophile or whatever. I know. Okay, maybe not that but are we saying that Santa's
1885.76 1890.32 speaker3  She's gonna be like
1888.32 1903.12 speaker4  It's always worse
1898.60 1922.32 speaker2  Drive check from Doreen marine. Oh at a negative 20 For being hopped up on morphine
1920.32 1971.76 speaker1  Oh
1968.36 2159.08 speaker2  This cop car is about to make a move You're on a two-lane country road again these trees Connecting over the top build the canopy to the moonlight to just kind of like Hit you every once in a while as you're driving just like You you are the first to notice and this cop is about to Pass you on this two-lane road to get in between you and the and the sprinter man slow down and pull over onto the side of the road the cop car just continues on past and Is right behind the sprinter van with its lights on siren going? You see the truck that Jerome Dyer's driving pulled over in the distance ahead of you Cop is behind you lights on Sprinter vans pulled over cop gets out of the car as he walks up Around the back of the sprinter van he gives it a weird like hand tap on the back like they always do it's like they'd have to touch your car as they approach it and It says officer McGovern Shout out to Jesse Mowry, Jesse Mowry, Jesse Mowry, Mowry, Mowry, Mowry, Mowry, Jesse Mowry Jesse Mowry Mowry Patron who created Steve McGovern who is basically Dale Gribble with a beard Dale Gribble being the Dale man from King of the Hill So this is him with a beard and this is Steve McGovern Thanks, Jesse.

2158.08 2181.84 speaker3  I go
2179.68 2243.66 speaker2  You notice a second Cop car pulls up behind his does the Backup and they talk for a second the guy who is in backup mode goes and gets back in his car Car stays put
2239.62 2282.42 speaker4  Yeah, he can't see that yet
2280.14 2316.96 speaker3  Slowly with a big smile Opens the door and swings out That to the ground No, I did not shoot
2312.78 2326.32 speaker2  I don't know firing shotguns in the woods and here you are
2324.32 2339.48 speaker1  You want to make us a potion?
2333.28 2395.60 speaker2  You are like turned around looking at this situation and you see dr. Hooch like climbing over The Chuckster in the front seat after Doreen has gotten out I wouldn't have thought they were gonna kill the cop. I don't know Let's find out what happens with dice rolling
2393.60 2403.16 speaker3  My anxiety
2401.48 2420.92 speaker2  or strength in order to
2415.36 2430.80 speaker3  Being the person that she's grabbing. Can I also roll to see how I don't know Lindsey. You're a your track record
2425.40 2434.48 speaker2  But if you know if you can sense what's happening, then you're gonna give her a plus 20 nice
2432.48 2456.80 speaker3  Thing he's crossed
2451.20 2498.60 speaker2  Doreen marine and you pull her up to where she can at least get one foot on that like step Your foot plants on to that as she grabs on to you and you fucking punch it immediately that backup cop just Sirens blaring again and you see officer Steve McGovern sprints back to get into his police car and The game is now afoot. Once again, Jerome Dyer is in the car with dr. Olivia Miller and he's like, what do I do?
2495.00 2520.12 speaker4  Unbelievable drive just drive. All right, or actually We could block them. We could block the cops give the other team a chance
2517.80 2572.90 speaker2  grabs hold of the ditch and just Kind of flings itself up onto right in the middle of this two-lane country road as the cops begin to drive up he rolled a 26 on his drive against fail on the cop the cop just Cannot get through on in time and literally just stops in the road You are looking past Jerome Dyer and Through the driver's side window. You can see this cop. It's headlights shining directly in on this truck You have two asleep people in the back and his sirens are going and the other cop is
2570.90 2585.30 speaker4  like continue, okay, so he's
2580.30 2679.44 speaker2  With a 22 he he's like you're brilliant. You're brilliant. I'm an idiot We're fumbling and he's just like doing that like Austin Powers like reverse for Reverse for sorry And then the other one starts to go and he blocks that one and then he goes back the other way and he's like, sorry Sorry. Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry This fucking idiot cannot drive this truck He honestly doesn't even deserve to be driving that f-250 that thing is a nice machine and I just don't understand how You know someone like diet
2674.24 2687.44 speaker3  Shut the door, so I'm driving with Doreen on my lap as fast as I can
2685.44 2733.24 speaker2  Mean not like that. Do you want to? Off of the driver dr. Hooch and dr. Hooch as you're driving on these long winding country roads You're gonna need to make a drive check to get away clean if you can pass a drive I'm gonna say at a plus 20 because of the extreme effort of Jerome Dyer and dr. Miller if you can pass
2731.24 2749.40 speaker3  sacletus go Maybe like we still make it we just run over like a rabbit or something
2747.40 2810.48 speaker2  Yeah, of course After just apologizing his ass off these cops head past you move on and he looks at dr. Miller and he's like Thank you. Your team is

2843.44 2952.98 speaker2  You're right the sprinter van and the truck with Jerome and dr. Miller Carl Lambert and Janice Ruth a huge warehouse door and the pin that is dropped on each of your clean phones with cases on them The pin is inside this one specific warehouse It's got a normal door next to one of those like enormous like corrugated metal doors that can open up for like You know a sprinter van to drive through it or something like that Large door begins to roll up and inside you just see like bright lights Shining out so that you can't really see into the darkness inside this warehouse As The doors close you see a single police car pulling up There are two men in this warehouse that is Blocked off to where you can't really see what's going on in the back of the warehouse There's some makeshift walls up front Just kind of like dividers and they're the only two people on this side of the dividers. One of them's like ah
2948.56 2986.86 speaker1  Man, Jim, we got cops. You wanna go take care of it
2983.18 3021.50 speaker2  But you have to let him know about this fucking foot inside the freezer And as you're about to start describing like the actual gritty details of it the other guy comes out literally in full Santa regalia and he's putting a silencer on the end of a pistol and He looks at you guys and he's like
3019.50 3026.14 speaker3  Colbeck

But she's like I'm sure that I'm sure that they can be convinced that you know something went down here, but they don't have any evidence and as far as I know
3095.60 3121.48 speaker2  Bigfoot that turned into a boy corpse. So they're gonna be fine. They're gonna go back out in the world I'll tell you exactly what's gonna happen.
