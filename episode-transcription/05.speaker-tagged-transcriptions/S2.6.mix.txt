Chirp, chirp, my hungry little chickadees. Mama Wolf is bringing that good slop fresh out of her gullet. Oh yeah. We're also live from 694.2 PTBP or something, I guess. this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from at Bagel Boy, who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod, which is the third quickest way to make wolf salivate. Bagel Boy writes, howdy wolf. Just wanted to send some good vibes your way and to tell you to stay greasy. I'm new to the big city I'm glad I got good old wolf to grace my hearing holes. The city seems nice so far. Aside from the fact that I've been mugged four damn times this week, I haven't seen a single damn police officer since I got here. Though I'll admit it does make me oddly feel like I'm right back home in sleepy, quiet contention. Anywho, keep up the good work over there and I'll keep on tuning in over here. Oh, and stay safe out here in the concrete jungle. I wouldn't want to see my good friend wolf on the evening news. Thanks for writing into the show, boy of bagels. I'm glad we got some listeners buzzing in from old sleepy and quiet contention. ever happened over there. No sir, redo.

192.92 279.78 speaker0  off on a wild goose chase to a mysterious drop pen for exclusive coverage of a secret town run by the Godel Company. They were joined by Stevie, a production assistant with a wall of dark wavy hair that covered all of her face except a pierced bottom lip. further and further off the grid. All the road signs told them to turn back, but they carried on until the CAN van made of tree-lined vines and kudzu, taking us now to the other side of this foresty facade,
277.78 281.78 speaker1  Were you at his house that said that?
279.78 283.78 speaker0  I didn't say it was disgusting, but I was like

380.78 397.78 speaker3  but it's like, you shouldn't do that
395.78 419.78 speaker2  No, I mean, it's by taking it Some people it's like random parts of the body So when I grow my facial hair out, it's only here and here So if you see me doing that, tell me not to
417.78 423.78 speaker3  So is it like a support group on Reddit kind of thing?
419.78 426.78 speaker2  Yeah, it's like a join this so that you can think about doing it so you stop doing it Interesting
425.78 438.78 speaker3  Should we get a spray bottle?
437.78 449.78 speaker2  It's literally like
444.78 464.78 speaker3  My thumb and middle fingernails have like indents
460.78 466.78 speaker2  And I'm not far enough, it's not a fetish yet
464.78 472.78 speaker3  Luke, you let me know when it is Yeah But Dude

519.78 572.78 speaker3  Solved What do you remember? What is the vision in your mind of what you saw at the end of the last episode? Crazy ravine where no ravine should be behind a crazy wall where no wall should be
571.78 594.78 speaker2  Okay Yeah, straight up evil trains, bro No tentacles on this one I didn't think there were but it seems Cthulhu-y to have tentacles Cthulhu-onian But also
593.78 603.78 speaker3  Cthulhu-onian
601.78 614.78 speaker2  And I listened to all the rest of them If you like Delta Green, holy shit, bro
612.78 625.78 speaker3  Listen to Pretending to Be People Season one Scary, very scary
618.78 650.78 speaker2  Also, his name is Blaine the Mono because Blaine the Train I guess is too stupid Okay Challenge accepted, yeah
647.78 664.78 speaker3  I'm Blaine the Mono, don't call me Blaine the Train
661.78 681.78 speaker2  No, it's pretty simple looking Aw, damn He's definitely sentient
680.78 722.78 speaker3  Yes Yes Okay, what's on the other side? The same thing that's on your side Which is? A train station and a wall A train station and a wall Yep, the fog is settled in the ravine below you Cool I need everyone to roll grip, as this is a deeply unnatural sight If you fail, you're just going to lose one grip
721.78 725.78 speaker2  3
723.78 881.78 speaker3  I rolled an 87, which is a failure Which is a failure So you're going to lose one grip, and with that, as you guys are looking around this area, Cal is... And this ravine should not be here This ravine can't be here Are you getting this? Are you getting shots of this? Oh my god, at a negative 20, that makes my intelligence 50? I got a 51 Julius Summers is the only one who really notices And I only say that because Cal Colorado is dealing with Not to touch my face Critical fail I didn't realize that Cal's money maker was Stevie, you're practically a Marvin, you don't know what that means, but Yeah
880.78 896.78 speaker1  Cool, I like that
894.78 924.78 speaker2  It's a kick ass Cal, could you stand next Julius points his phone at Cal and looks at his phone to see like how good he looks on his screen Sure
923.78 937.78 speaker3  Yes Is he made up Yeah and honestly it's Maybe you slide over to a filter Oh for sure, yeah
929.78 987.78 speaker2  Well one of the things that Julius did on the way here was, because he didn't have to drive, was make a can filter Specifically made for Cal, Colorado A calcan? The calcam for the calzone The calcam for the calzone
986.78 992.78 speaker1  Julius
990.78 993.78 speaker2  You want me to go on right now?
992.78 999.78 speaker3  You want me to be on?
996.78 1018.78 speaker2  You can practice a TikTok?
1015.78 1069.78 speaker3  Right now I'm acting very hard The god old corporation in their avarice has torn a trench into mother earth Make it fun Not this reporter
1064.78 1076.78 speaker2  And then he just starts editing the can talk together
1074.78 1099.78 speaker1  But like maybe we wait to post that Like what if it's like, you know a nuclear test site We don't want people like rushing out here to see it
1096.78 1126.78 speaker2  He continues editing the TikTok And he doesn't post it, but he sends it to his uncle
1124.78 1173.78 speaker3  All seemingly made out of steel All built for this one single car You see that there are lockers adjacent on the exterior wall of the station And above it the sign of course says, welcome to Grover's Gorge Founded by Frank Godel in 1945 by necessity not choice I actually saw that What If episode What?
1171.78 1206.78 speaker2  What Would You Do with John Qui√±ones? You've never seen What Would You Do? The whole premise of the show is like We get actors to do really shitty things in public And then we see what the public does What Would You Do? What would you do if a guy beat up a little kid? What would you do if he was at home Sixteen seasons February 26, 2008, the present I've never even heard of this show
1204.78 1219.78 speaker1  There's a lot of people who haven't seen it But for some reason I've seen like every episode Everybody on the show that ends up being on the show
1217.78 1224.78 speaker3  It was created by Chris Whipple Which is a very fun name That is a very fun name Chris Whipple
1222.78 1230.78 speaker2  Not a fun show, really, though
1227.78 1239.78 speaker1  Like, how far can we see? How far does this ravine go?
1237.78 1261.78 speaker3  You can see to the other side That a hundred meters across But the fog is just filling up this ravine And then the fog kind of So you can't even see the end of these walls Of massive plant life
1260.78 1267.78 speaker1  Would you be able to see it?
1264.78 1278.78 speaker3  If it was within about a hundred meters of you on either side
1275.78 1285.78 speaker1  Hey, Stevie, would you grab a mic clip out of there? Here you go, sir
1282.78 1291.78 speaker2  And he shows it to Beck He's like, can you get audio from this?
1290.78 1312.78 speaker1  Hang on a second He wires it up to the receiver Oh no, we can't afford to lose a whole mic, dude
1309.78 1335.78 speaker3  The network will not be pleased to hear about how you wanted to use their equipment And unfortunately, Beck and I are duty bound to report it Or perhaps a church choir
1333.78 1359.78 speaker2  It's wired for sure So yeah, Julius throws the mic with the mic clip over the side But then it just like six feet later stops Cause it's wired in
1358.78 1373.78 speaker3  Dude, thanks! And I knuckle, Stevie As if he's heard that voice from someone else in a past life Another faithful
1371.78 1378.78 speaker2  That was smart, I am smart
1375.78 1393.78 speaker1  Hey, Julius, like if you're trying to like get a sense of like the depth here We could just do the old fashion way And Beck finds a rock Dosses it over the edge to listen for the sound
1390.78 1397.78 speaker3  As if you threw a rock off of a cliff
1396.78 1406.78 speaker1  Uh huh
1403.78 1415.78 speaker3  Like basically 80 stories And then you hear just Of a rock hitting water
1413.78 1435.78 speaker1  Uh, there's water down there I know I heard it The mic's hanging over the edge there And I picked it up on my headphones
1433.78 1456.78 speaker3  On this simple single train car You see two steel doors One toward the rear One toward the front And they both slide open Without obstructing the large lettering Laid out under the train car's windows
1454.78 1465.78 speaker2  That this is what we would be looking at But I think if we go in I can impress my uncle
1463.78 1470.78 speaker3  Your uncle didn't tell you anything You haven't been in contact with him
1468.78 1472.78 speaker2  And acts like he doesn't hear this
1470.78 1519.78 speaker3  Given that assignment by The woman who took my job Is it also enveloped in fog Or can we see, like, the center clearly You can see the center of the bridge clearly Okay In the middle of the bridge or something Like there's evidence of, like, cartoonish Burn patterns or something Cal's looking at the center of the bridge It doesn't look like anything weird We'll just pass uneventfully To the other station Perhaps that's where this gate is
1517.78 1524.78 speaker2  And finds the snack cart Stevie's, uh
1522.78 1563.78 speaker3  And dragging it up into the back And the seating in this train car Is similar to the types of train cars That have a narrow aisle Running down the middle of the car With two seats on either side Oh you mean All trains So with five rows There's enough space here For Magic 20 passengers Some light refreshments Energy drink Energy drink
1562.78 1567.78 speaker2  And pretzels
1565.78 1617.78 speaker3  Is made by the Godel Corporation Is just a plain, like, aluminum Unpainted can with energy drink Painted in the same green That, like, the That was on the wall outside And yeah, you find some energy drinks There And there are large windows On either side of this steel train car Which kind of looks like a giant can of energy drink And the lettering is green So it matches Is this the can tram? This is the can tram Fuck yeah Cal steps on and says Now it's the cal tram Mounted in both the front and the rear The modern flat screens Flicker to life As you all enter And you see a blank White sound stage With a white stool On the screens Oh if your stool is white You should probably get that checked out Yeah, definitely
1616.78 1620.78 speaker2  Like some like Sun dried dog poop
1619.78 1621.78 speaker3  Yeah, that's
1620.78 1628.78 speaker2  That is not natural Poop, white poop
1627.78 1631.78 speaker3  Sits on the stool Oh no
1629.78 1637.78 speaker1  Stool, you said it again And smiles
1635.78 1642.78 speaker2  What do you think of?
1641.78 1649.78 speaker1  What are you guys?
1647.78 1662.78 speaker3  I think of a very gross poopy When we start calling it stool There's a reason it's been collected And it can't be good A man walks into the frame Sits on the stool And smiles at the viewer
1661.78 1667.78 speaker2  Well hello there
1666.78 1747.78 speaker3  And you see the Fred Godel He's a soft looking man In his later 60s With a loose plumpness And glasses That consistently look like They're about to fall off of his nose With black pants and shoes Fred's green shirt I'm overjoyed that you're here to join me On a tour of the future Before we begin Please leave all outside food and beverages In the complimentary lockers On the outside of this here Simple steel single train car sized train station Fred Godel points his finger into the air And a purple light comes on This one means there's still Outside food or beverages in the car He moves his hand a bit over And a green light comes on Definitely the purple And Stevie kind of looks at the screen With this like anger As she goes down to the bag But did you finish the coke in that energy drink That I brought you? Yeah but hang on a sec
1746.78 1758.78 speaker1  And finding energy drinks And is chugging
1756.78 1760.78 speaker3  And see if the light stays purple
1758.78 1771.78 speaker1  Yeah of course Cal Let me just get Topped up here real quick Hang on Do you need to be burped?
1769.78 1779.78 speaker2  Julius is going to wander up there And see if he can't just like Turn the light off or something
1777.78 1787.78 speaker3  Colored bulbs over the top Of where the light is And just the bulb on the outside Is the coloration that's making it
1785.78 1795.78 speaker2  So Julius's hand Over the light doesn't As Julius puts his hand
1793.78 1797.78 speaker3  His hand kind of turns
1796.78 1820.78 speaker2  Right like I'm not saying that it's going to change I'm saying like just if it's covered up Like Continues to hold his hand over the light Just to see It's not doing anything Still doesn't
1818.78 1828.78 speaker1  Putting the bag outside the train car Whatever she was doing I've gotten my fill And we are keeping one Energy drink with us to see
1826.78 1841.78 speaker3  I got rid of all of the snacks and drinks That we brought except for And she flicks a finger At the one in Beck's hand And then we look to the light And the light is still purple
1839.78 1863.78 speaker2  All the drinks And then he No As he nods his head up and down
1861.78 1874.78 speaker3  They have for this outside food or drink But I don't think it's based on your word
1871.78 1877.78 speaker2  That knows whether you have a drink or not?
1876.78 1886.78 speaker3  And they just ask you there But this light seems more insistent Now that you mentioned it Cal
1885.78 1896.78 speaker1  Like And then Beck wants to see if there's a camera
1894.78 1903.78 speaker3  Yeah go ahead and roll search Or you can roll computer science
1901.78 1909.78 speaker1  Which is good for my computer science So you know where to look
1907.78 1941.78 speaker3  Black sheen plastic The top middle The front of this train cabin Above the TV Sheen Very ethical corporation You see that there's a A red blinking light on it Did anyone else succeed? I did succeed at search Bro Yeah so the two of you noticed That there are sensors of some sort On the doors And the entrances On the front and back Entrances of this train car
1940.78 1948.78 speaker1  Smile dudes We're on candid camera And I'm no tech wizard like you
1946.78 1953.78 speaker3  There are some sensors on this door Food sensors
1952.78 1961.78 speaker1  Good work You're right man Those are sensors You're getting the hang of this tech stuff my man
1959.78 1979.78 speaker3  Openly blushing a little bit behind the makeup It might just be the flush of like a Poison oaked face Glatter than a young person saying He did something right with technology
1977.78 2003.78 speaker2  And he walks up to Beck If you want that You better drink it Oh yeah Oh yeah
2002.78 2006.78 speaker1  It hasn't stopped
2005.78 2015.78 speaker3  He's a little wired and just like Pointed his camera right at the camera I see you
2014.78 2026.78 speaker1  So Train go And I guess I'll throw the can out the door
2025.78 2040.78 speaker3  I say train go In the same way that you guys ask me these kinds of questions Did you try to sneak any additional food or bev?
2038.78 2045.78 speaker2  Oh by the way I still
2044.78 2055.78 speaker1  Idiot You didn't
2053.78 2256.78 speaker3  The door shuts Hey guys I do have like six hamburgers in my pocket Oh yeah I've got a bunch of wet lasagna It does so at a quick clip The flat screens show an animation that follows along with a serious voiceover Later that year Evil itself was extinguished As the velocity of this train Has whipped up enough of this fog That it's moving up out of the ravine And towards the clouds And you can see deep 836 feet down Almost 80 stories which would make this Was the thought of coming back home And marrying his sweetheart But Frank, freshly back from stamping out evil overseas Returned only to find evil at his doorstep Threatening his future You can all see just how smooth and strange this wall face is Like nothing you've ever seen before Lasted for 13 hours and 56 minutes The fog in this absurdly deep canyon clears out even more And you see a church building Still mostly intact But completely upside down Awkwardly stabilized by jutting rocks from both sides The steeple reaches out for the water below But the house of God is well stuck You can see on your left hand side The church did not In its place, the Godel Company cared for Grover's Gorge And kept its residents fed, clothed, housed and safe Sitting in his green shirt on his white stool Let me show you a future without hunger, without pain Welcome to Grover's Gorge
2255.78 2264.78 speaker1  Oh damn
2261.78 2275.78 speaker3  Strangely, it feels identical That's not so strange, you look exactly the same That's right, if everyone could roll heavy machinery, architecture, or search Whichever you'd like
2273.78 2285.78 speaker1  I passed search with a 14
2283.78 2328.78 speaker3  Okay, so you all rolled search, so Heavy machinery, architecture, or search So with the success there, you kind of match up Where the door was on the original side Like how far away it was from the station And you can pretty quickly make your way over and find the door through the plant matter On this side as well However, it seems to wrap itself in a way in which you can open this door Without needing to like, cut through any of this shit
2323.78 2339.78 speaker1  Looking around in the train to see its level of decrepitness
2338.78 2369.78 speaker3  But like, maintained? Okay, I don't have any in that, so I won't do it
2365.78 2380.78 speaker2  Is there like a path that's been followed through this Or does it seem like we might be one of the few that have used this station?
2377.78 2391.78 speaker3  I tricked him, I tricked him Can I get a pointy look? Do you have luck already?
2390.78 2429.78 speaker2  Nah, I have luck already Okay, nevermind Joe, you can't have any And emerge from the other side
2426.78 2434.78 speaker1  Cause the lockers at the first side was to kind of leave our shit in
2431.78 2435.78 speaker3  There are lockers on this side, it is exactly identical
2434.78 2441.78 speaker1  Aw, lame We should have looked in those lockers back there and seen if they were something I mean Stevie did, she put the food in the lockers right?
2440.78 2443.78 speaker3  Oh yeah
2441.78 2454.78 speaker1  Stevie, did you see anything in those lockers? Oh, I didn't open up a bunch of them
2449.78 2491.78 speaker3  There was already keys in them so I just locked it and I guess this is our key And then she walks over and she's holding up a key that is number 5 And she's like, oh these are alphabetical on this side it looks like Wait, E Try L7 Try E She walks up and there are keys in all of the doors on this side Drats Except for
2490.78 2495.78 speaker1  Yeah I guess
2494.78 2498.78 speaker3  She's like, ah it doesn't fit
2496.78 2501.78 speaker1  This is so fucking cool
2499.78 2754.78 speaker3  You open B, it is empty I put my pocket lasagna in B And on the other side of this enormous and lush impediment Is a vast opening with plenty to unpack You're looking at a sprawling town park straight out of the 1950's idea of the future Perfectly manicured trees like enormous emerald cake pops Lying a colorful synthetic walkway This slightly bouncy comfortable sidewalk would take you all the way around this gigantic green area ahead of you It's like a big square and the path is a big square going around it And on the far side of this green space Maybe about 255 meters away or so So really far, these people are really tiny, you see tiny people in the distance People wearing like yellow and green uniforms There are two statues of men Each about 26.3 meters tall And they stand tall in front of a gorgeous building Seemingly made of glass and grass There's a massive square park green space in the middle The trees outline the green space And on the side that you're on, behind you, there's just this enormous wall of plant life You can go left or right To follow the path To follow the path And you would assume that based on what you can see in the park that it would lead you in a big square around Yeah, I did say that Fuck yeah Cal puts a foot out on it and then gives a few steps out and starts springing a little bit on it Yeah, it looks like even Cal could go for a jog and it wouldn't hurt his knees Everyone roll grip You are in a completely, seemingly unnatural to you location This is weird, huh?
2748.78 2762.78 speaker1  Beck is not only filming, but he's zooming in to try and see if there's anything on the closest uniform If there's any kind of logos or names or anything
2760.78 2808.78 speaker3  Does it look like anybody's noticed us? As you're now looking at the people who are walking, people are walking on this pathway And they're all kind of side-eyeing you as they're passing, but no one has approached You see that everyone is wearing nice clothes, they're like very well made Everyone who is walking on the pathway is wearing grey-scale joggers and athleisure But then with a flare of green or a flare of yellow And everyone who's sitting nicely casually, having a picnic, is dressed
2806.78 2812.78 speaker2  I was gonna say they're all in Oakland Acor
2809.78 2844.78 speaker3  Oh yeah, so it's either green or yellow No one is wearing both that you've seen so far, but everyone is wearing something The people who are sitting at like picnics, the men are wearing like nice black shorts The women are wearing like a green or a yellow sundress The people who are playing a sport of any kind are Everyone is wearing clothes that are specifically built for what they're doing And everyone has like nice, what you would call like upper shelf athleisure
2843.78 2860.78 speaker2  Julius You're a pro, right? Julius, I am the pro Beck, from what I know, you're a pro?
2857.78 2874.78 speaker3  Hidden behind a giant mysterious ravine That apparently Frank Godel created in a fight with evil itself
2872.78 2875.78 speaker1  Ma-Cal? What did I say?
2874.78 2885.78 speaker3  You said Ma-Cal Rolling on Ba-Beck, Ba-Beck, Ba-Beck
2884.78 2891.78 speaker1  We're standing here I've always just had this voice
2889.78 2902.78 speaker2  Uh, would you like to be on TV?
2896.78 2976.78 speaker3  So just like clean and glimmering in the sunshine And there's a woman who's mid-twenties, blonde ponytail bobbing up and down as she's jogging She's not bobbing for apples For apples?
