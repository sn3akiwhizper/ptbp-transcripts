8.68 61.04 speaker1  Let's just get wild, y'all. It's your local radio DJ that you actually wanna listen to, Wolf the Dog. He's real torn up about it, but there just wasn't enough free time this week to release an episode that is up to snuff. For this, he feels shame, regret, and just a tinge of arousal. He wants each and every one of you but quality time with the incomparable, and formidable love of his life is paramount. Thank you deeply for understanding. You know, back in the day, old Wolfie Boy

63.84 75.92 speaker1  wondering what she's up to back in contention. How many dumpsters has she dove in without me?
73.22 86.76 speaker0  So go on, Zach, whoever the hell that is. Enjoy your life.
84.80 96.24 speaker1  but for now, hold on tight and keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle. Playing us in and immediately out is Kudzu with No Backbone. Tell me it hurts.
