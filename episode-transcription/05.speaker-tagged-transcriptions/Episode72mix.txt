0.00 152.58 speaker0  Greetings, my chubby babies. It's your thick fat daddy Wolf the dog, here to slap, lap, and crap right into your chunky little ear holes. I, of course, am emanating from the basement. 694.2 PTBP, from the future to the past. But the past is your present? I don't know, time travel confuses me, but I still do it constantly because it makes my innards feel frisky. Speaking of frisky business, this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from at Shemelan Shmusk, who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod. It's that easy, y'all. They right, hell yeah. From Adam to Eric, thank you for letting me know about this podcast. It made the first few months of baby Aurelia's life even better. Recently, I took her to her six month checkup, and after they gave her her shots, they cut my dick off. Turns out it's actually pretty common. We love you all the way from DC, DTF. Well, Adam and Eric, I hope y'all have fun running around dickless or whatever. Do y'all know how they dispose of discarded dongs? I sure do, and I'll never tell how or why I know or what kind of wine goes best with a wok-fried wang. spread around some internet love by tagging at PretendingPod on Twitter and Instagram. at patreon.com slash PretendingPod. Also, my producer says the current plan is to record another Q&A episode for this here main feed that will be released quite soon, like maybe next Friday soon. So head on over to the subreddit at reddit.com r slash PretendingToBePeople and find the Q&A thread to submit your questions. Also, feel free to send those questions to at PretendingPod on Twitter as well. Me, I'm tired of the past. It's given me them blues. Thank fuck this is the last broadcast
149.60 171.48 speaker1  I'm blasting out old news. Last episode, the PCs all signed some sort of paperwork to partner with the calm, comfy campground on something called Operation Hole Puncher in a room filled with the flowers found all over the island.
169.00 256.24 speaker0  from a cottage filled with security equipment with some sort of spray made from the flowers on the island. Angela, when cornered and confused by the actions of the group, I'm assuming this may perhaps be the last time And I've been saving this one for this perfect moment. I have the distinct pleasure to present to each of you for the very first time, Dream Girl with Pretty Sexual. ["Pretty Sexual"] [" Working For You"]
255.24 283.84 speaker1  Is that why... Hey, Justin. Go fuck yourself up. That's nice. Good burp, Luke. You're being mean to me, Zach. Oh, I don't think so, personally. I personally do think so. Oh, okay. Personally. Could you just give me a rundown of how I've been mean to you? That way I can better myself?
282.84 289.24 speaker3  No. You called him ugly.
287.20 326.56 speaker1  You hurt me emotionally. You have been hitting him a lot. Oh, that's when I stopped. Dad. Oh, no, dad.
324.56 332.12 speaker2  Finish it.
328.56 357.88 speaker3  No, daddy is hot. Dad is disturbing. We need to take this all out. All of it? Yeah. Some of it. Okay, let's start now. Hey, Zech. Hey, Joe. Would you fuck, Justin? Would I?
356.88 361.44 speaker2  Did I?
358.20 365.16 speaker3  You had a rough middle school, didn't you? Doesn't everybody have a rough middle school?
364.16 370.80 speaker2  Okay, well...
368.20 387.36 speaker3  That's why we have a role-playing podcast. How's everyone's week going? Better than middle school.
385.36 395.92 speaker2  About the same as middle school.
394.92 402.84 speaker1  Shut up, Justin.
401.84 412.36 speaker3  nice. Aren't you a little old to be in college?
411.36 414.36 speaker2  Nah.
413.36 419.36 speaker1  I like them young.
418.36 439.36 speaker2  Oh, yeah.
438.36 451.36 speaker3  Holy shit. This is for five people in our listening audience, but have you guys seen the video of Tony LaRosa? The DUI thing?
450.36 458.36 speaker2  No. It's pretty good. It's amazing. I haven't.
454.36 472.36 speaker3  Okay, Tony LaRosa, former manager of the St. Louis Cardinals. Rip. Rip. Good team. Yeah. Anyway, he- The MLB. What?
470.36 480.36 speaker2  Just fell asleep, stopped in his car.
478.36 484.36 speaker3  do you know what I do? I'm in professional baseball.
482.36 491.36 speaker2  Oh, no.
489.36 575.36 speaker3  That's super cool of him. Well, God damn it. He also took Albert Pools to that fucking Glenn Beck rally for America. Yeah. How did Albert feel about that? game. a quick rundown. So on December 1st- This is not a good start. Cooper and Jack Russell in the back. You are all paddling for your lives. I need everyone to roll a sanity. I pass. On a-
574.36 576.36 speaker1  99.
575.36 579.36 speaker3  Yes.
578.36 585.36 speaker2  Almost 100.
584.36 603.36 speaker1  Don't leave. He'll do bad things. Luke, no. Goodbye forever.
599.36 697.36 speaker3  You guys failed sanity, which means that you turn around now. Sometimes it's a good thing. That Martin Cupertino, you're actually in the same canoe as Jack Russell. In the next canoe forward, we've got Charles Digby, who looks back just in time to see an unspeakable worm-like abomination erupts above the surface of the water. This thing rises 10 feet up out of the black inky darkness. It is tube-like, covered in a squamous black partially translucent membrane. Its body is segmented, and toxically green pulsating arteries and veins can be seen through its thin-looking exterior. It has no identifiable eyes or nose. Its cavernous, circular mouths, one sitting just inside the other, are lined with hooked teeth, and it spits out a saliva that is somehow darker than black. From this maw, a sharp stylet protrudes, like something between a tongue and a noodle-like needle. It plunges down and attaches to the top of Jack Russell's head. And then it rips him out of the back of the canoe, sucking the short, portly man up into its round, teeth-encircled mouth, before slipping quickly and quietly back into the pitch-black water of Lake Calm.
695.36 702.36 speaker1  Oh, what was that? Squamous. What was that? Squamous.
701.36 754.36 speaker3  Did I say it right? I think you did. I thought it was squamous. I rolled a five. Okay, so you lose five sanity. Cool. Martin Cupertino loses five sanity, and Charles Digby just loses one sanity. to least likely. Flight, fight, and freeze. Well, yeah, if he thinks he can't match it, flight. If he has no choice, fight. I think the last thing he would do is freeze. Okay, sounds good. So if you roll a one, you'll freeze. If you roll a two or a three, you'll fight. And if you roll a four, five, six. On a d6? Fight. This thing is all the way back down in the water, so you are now alone in your canoe, ready to fight.
752.36 756.36 speaker2  Do I have a syringe?
754.36 789.36 speaker3  Do I have anything else? You've got the map, and the syringe, and the cassettes. Nice. He knows it. He can do it. I don't like to say that he can, because he sucks, but he can do it. He can do it.
788.36 802.36 speaker2  He's pretty good at it. So he's ready. He's in the canoe. Oh, my God.
801.36 811.36 speaker3  Okay. Yeah, fuck yeah. Then you'll get a bonus if it comes for you next.
810.36 832.36 speaker1  Fuck. Joe, a microphone? Do we say it in the mic? Joe.
829.36 862.36 speaker3  You're still rowing and rowing, and Alan is like, we got to keep rowing. So I need you to roll a strength or an athletics or swimming. Walter succeeds on his check and does some good rows. Walter does? Sorry. Walter fails. Walter fails. Okay, so you guys keep rowing. You're getting almost to the shore on the opposite side. You're very, very near the shore on the opposite side. Roger Fairfield, you're in a canoe with Charles Digby who...
861.36 864.36 speaker1  We got to row. We got to row.
863.36 866.36 speaker4  We got to row.
864.36 882.36 speaker1  He looks, I'm frozen staring behind us. Oh shit.
876.36 891.36 speaker3  there, including the nothingness that used to be Jack Russell, who is no longer in the back of the canoe. You just see Martin Cupertino by himself now. And what is he doing?
890.36 919.24 speaker2  He was in back. Let me just say that. Sure. Like he took time when they were fleeing at the start of this to say to Jack Russell, like, no, I'm in back. I steer. Me. Okay.
915.32 925.12 speaker3  So I need you all to roll, uh, Justin and Thomas, Martin Cupertino and Charles Digby will be at a negative 20% for failing their sanity checks.
923.96 936.68 speaker2  I, I fail. I would have passed except for that negative 20.
935.68 970.18 speaker3  I thought sanity. I've got a little chart that they can see, so I'll just show it off. But basically there are four blank boxes for each canoe and the Grimes have three boxes marked off because they are the closest to the shore. And then Fairfield and Digby in a canoe have two out of the four boxes checked.
969.18 987.82 speaker2  Oh no. I thought most boxes was worse. Turns out it's good. The least boxes checked.
981.12 1019.50 speaker3  At this point, I'm going to roll a D six to decide as the water around all of you begins to move and something massive underneath is choosing its next target. You're one. Uh, we got, you're rolling a D six. I'm rolling a D six. Roger Fairfield is two. Charles Digby is three. Walter Grimes is four. Alan Grimes is five, six re-roll miss. It stays dormant. How about that?
1018.50 1029.82 speaker1  I don't know.
1027.98 1056.54 speaker3  So the water around you. Shit. Wow.
1052.94 1062.66 speaker1  Have you been recording our casual conversation this whole time?
1061.66 1071.78 speaker2  Praise.
1064.38 1077.94 speaker3  So that noise that you just heard was me spilling my drink all over myself and over a lot of XLR cables.
1072.78 1085.78 speaker2  That's what he calls simultaneously coming pissing and shitting his pants. Typical Zach.
1084.78 1087.78 speaker3  That's what it's called, right?
1086.78 1088.78 speaker2  You're very close.
1087.78 1141.50 speaker3  It's Ploweka. That's what it's called, right? So, implant. going to use my actual actions instead of my dice roll. coming for Martin Cupertino, but I was reaching for my dice to roll that attack. So instead of that attack roll, I'm going to use the fumble because Zach fumbled my attempt to grab the dice.
1140.50 1146.02 speaker2  You blundered.
1145.02 1156.30 speaker4  Oh my God.
1155.30 1161.42 speaker2  Oh. That's true. When has he? Aw. Aw.
1160.42 1163.42 speaker1  Not true.
1161.42 1169.38 speaker2  He flosses before every session.
1166.58 1258.28 speaker3  So basically you all- Body pillow. Turn around just in time to see this absolute tube-like creature comes 10 feet out of the once again, but it rises 10 feet out of the water. It is an unspeakable worm-like abomination, tube-like, covered in squamous black partially translucent membrane. Its body is segmented and toxically green pulsating arteries and veins can be seen through its thin looking exterior. It has no identifiable eyes or nose. Its cavernous circular mouths, one sitting just inside the other, are lined with hooked teeth and it spits out a saliva that is somehow darker than black. And actually, instead of going for an attack on Martin Cupertino, all of this spit comes out and just lands all over the canoe. You can roll a dodge or a dexterity to try to avoid this goop getting all over you. Yeah, it failed- But it vomited. Literally grabbing you and- Doing a bad. Pulling you in.
1255.92 1270.06 speaker2  Roll athletics since that's a 65. There you go.
1263.78 1298.76 speaker3  As the back gets completely drenched in this goop that is blacker than the water of Lake Calm, which you thought was already so dark that it basically pulled light away from the So swimming, athletics. Pass.
1297.28 1308.84 speaker1  I'm like, oh, cramp.
1301.72 1333.04 speaker3  So as this goop just gets all over the back of Martin Cupertino's canoe, he jumps back and keeps paddling from the front with such a swiftness that he pulls up even with Roger Fairfield and Charles Digby. Swiftly moving, yeah. Swiftly through the water in perfect, literally- Stroke. Stroke. Stroke. Stroke.
1332.04 1340.92 speaker4  We got to do it like that.
1335.04 1386.32 speaker3  So the Grimes actually reach the shore on the other side and immediately Alan's like, And he's trying to pull the canoe up onto the- And you guys are up on the shore. Now we've got three people in the water, so I'm going to roll another D6. Fairfield, and five and six is Charles Digby. Who is two?
1383.74 1391.40 speaker1  Quit being mean to Tommy.
1390.40 1399.14 speaker2  Yeah.
1395.12 1417.52 speaker3  Just jump, like comes out of the water, almost like a proboscis, but like something from inside its maw is coming toward you and is trying to attach to the top of your head.
1416.52 1428.36 speaker2  Exactly. I grab that and I just try to shove it up the maw instead of my head. Absolutely.
1422.52 1443.12 speaker3  So go ahead and roll melee weapons or karate. It is my unarmed combat.
1442.12 1452.48 speaker2  Melee. Melee. Meal worm weapons.
1451.48 1470.92 speaker3  So you win. Yeah. So as this thing comes down, this like noodle like needle coming out of the middle of its circular vast mouth is like trying to fight its way through.
1469.92 1490.24 speaker2  Left. Right. is.
1489.24 1513.96 speaker3  head. You knock it back and as the maw like gets pulled down with this weird style that's protruding from its mouth. You like jam the or in sideways like in star Wars when Luke gets the in the compactor. Yes. In the mouth. The rain core. The rain core.
1512.96 1516.96 speaker2  I keep its jaws open. Yeah.
1515.96 1528.76 speaker3  And it lets it lets out this.
1525.36 1533.00 speaker2  But he's now he's now he's paddling with both hands. All right.
1532.00 1545.26 speaker3  You're good. You're safe. Can I pass 16? As they're rowing and rowing, what are the Grimes doing?
1539.38 1552.56 speaker2  I want to find a medium sized rock that's like kind of sharp and I'm going to skip it at the monster.
1547.80 1557.56 speaker3  So you'll do that to help aid if it's coming at someone on the next attack.
1554.32 1561.92 speaker4  For every one of these, I rolled a 92, a 93, and a 96. Oh my God.
1558.56 1564.92 speaker3  Roger Fairfield can't canoe to save his God damn life. I mean, literally.
1563.92 1568.92 speaker2  He rolled a 92, 93, and 94.
1567.92 1570.92 speaker3  I should have lied. I should have lied.
1569.92 1572.92 speaker1  I passed.
1571.92 1577.92 speaker4  Let's go back. It was a 92, a 93, and a 94. Roll again.
1576.92 1609.92 speaker3  All right. So Fairfield Digby and Martin Cupertino, the canoes are side by side at this point and you guys are one success away from being safe on the shore on the other side as this water moves and you feel the canoes, both of your canoes just kind of like lift up a little bit as you're rowing. One two for Martin Cupertino, three four for Roger Fairfield, five six for Charles Digby. That's a four. That's Roger Fairfield. You deserve it.
1608.92 1621.80 speaker1  Okay.
1620.80 1630.48 speaker2  Whatever it is. You just drop it. My wrist.
1629.48 1648.28 speaker1  Yeah, no.
1642.88 1676.84 speaker3  And he too fails, so there will be no assist on this, Joe. So as this thing is coming up out of the water, emitting this weird, almost green, almost dark, just like liquid that is all over its body. It's actually like an oil now that is covering the top of Lake Calm surrounding you. And it is coming down straight for your head.
1672.84 1714.88 speaker4  Having seen Martin just handle it with his oar, I'm going to try and if it's coming straight down at me, I want to knock it like a baseball bat would be knocking a ball out of the air. You mean that thing I don't have? I'm going to use, this is the third set of dice I've used, but I'm going to change the dice again. Let him re-roll. Let him re-roll.
1706.36 1733.32 speaker3  And so as this water beast rises up and comes down toward you, you bat away just enough, kind of throws it off its trajectory, and the proboscis goes right into the canoe in between you and Charles Digby, and it actually punctures into the canoe, so you'll both take a negative twenty percent on your next athletics checks to try to get to the safety of the
1732.32 1746.12 speaker1  Wonderful. Now you're taking me down with you hun.
1744.88 1758.32 speaker4  I finally pass one. I get a forty-three. But wait, with your minus twenty percent? I don't pass. Fuck!
1756.60 1772.32 speaker2  Wait, is this good or bad? This is bad. You know it's terrible. You rolled a one hundred. Yeah, I rolled a one hundred. I rolled a one hundred. A one zero zero. Yep, that's a hundred. A one zero zero.
1771.32 1775.00 speaker3  That should have been a crit fail.
1774.00 1776.00 speaker2  Did we make that rule?
1775.00 1809.92 speaker3  I forgot about that. take the, uh, we're going into, like, percentiles of how much land is left between you and the shore, and you guys still have one success left, but now Martin Cupertino needs two or
1807.64 1814.00 speaker1  I don't like this new mechanic, because it's scary.
1813.00 1818.20 speaker2  Yeah.
1814.00 1822.92 speaker1  Well, tough shit, because it's going to come up in every situation from now on.
1820.60 1823.92 speaker3  That's Charles Digby is getting it this time.
1822.92 1831.80 speaker1  No. Like, good getting it, or? No. Charles Digby's getting it. Getting it.
1829.52 1835.00 speaker2  Charles Digby can get it.
1834.00 1845.68 speaker3  What do I need to roll? You need to roll whatever you're going to do to try to avoid getting sucked up into the worm. The water worm.
1843.96 1889.44 speaker1  Can I just, like, aggressively paddle forward? Would I still get my decrease, though? Yes, you would. I think I'd probably want to do, like, a similar thing, where, like, I want to bat it away with the paddle. Are they, like, big, sturdy paddles I'm assuming? I don't have any fucking other stuff to use. I know.
1886.44 1900.16 speaker3  It doesn't lend itself, so give it a go.
1899.16 1901.16 speaker2  Oh, nice.
1900.16 1934.04 speaker3  Unfortunately- That won't be able to help as- Yeah, it actually hits the worm, and it's got a really thin exterior, and so you see one of the arteries of this thing just, like, flops out of the skin, and this toxically green, like, liquid begins pouring on top of Lake Calm. D4.
1933.04 1944.08 speaker1  D4.
1943.08 1947.08 speaker3  Just a little guy. Just a little guy. Just a little guy.
1946.08 1956.72 speaker2  However-
1955.72 1963.56 speaker1  Fuck you, Alan.
1957.40 1999.16 speaker3  As Charles Digby just yells, fuck you, Alan, this sharp stylet protrudes, and it's this tongue, noodle-like needle plunges down and attaches to the top of Charles Digby's head, and it is ripping you up into its maw currently. You guys have one action to try to fix this, otherwise he's going into this creature. All right. And what is Martin Cupertino doing? What is Walter Grimes doing?
1995.16 2004.84 speaker2  I'd like to use this opportunity to get another box checked on them. Okay, yeah, you can.
2003.84 2069.48 speaker3  97. 97. The roll. up and you're five feet off the ground. The only thing keeping you connected to this canoe is Roger Fairfield, who has hands on both of your feet and is just in a tug of war with a giant Xenonema toad. And he's just pulling and pulling, and this thing's pulling at your head. I need you to roll a constitution.
2068.48 2092.76 speaker1  Yes. Constitution. Oh, good. 53 on a 55.
2084.72 2164.20 speaker3  you apart and you reach up and grab onto this thing's tongue just in time before it snapped your spinal cord and ripped your head off of the rest of your body. You and Roger Fairfield together just like snap this thing off your head. You are now, what was your hair situation like before? a gorilla costume to come rip your toupee off? Well that happens and you get scalped. You hired a nematode. Your head is bleeding to the point to where your eyes are having trouble seeing through It was putting so much into it that it just rips backward into the water as it falls backwards
2163.20 2176.68 speaker1  Yes. Yeah. You're Costanz-ing.
2167.20 2186.36 speaker3  However, where the bald spot is is just raw blood and like skin that is like three layers
2185.36 2202.24 speaker4  Thank you, Joe. I love you.
2201.24 2214.00 speaker1  Y'all heard about that dirty Hershey's? Those Hershey's clerks.
2213.00 2230.68 speaker2  Dirty Hershey's. Dirty Hershey's. I got it. It was too far. Elbow bump. Elbow bump. I mean, you can get it but it doesn't make it good. Thank you. Did you hit record?
2229.68 2246.88 speaker1  Yes, I did. Yeah, I don't want to miss out on dirty Hersh.
2244.76 2247.88 speaker3  How dong-like is this thing?
2246.88 2294.36 speaker1  That's what I was thinking.
2285.68 2295.36 speaker3  all standing in the room where you met for orientation and two steps forward, three steps
2294.36 2309.48 speaker2  backward. How are we supposed to feel motivated to escape this creature on the lake, Zach?
2306.68 2312.36 speaker3  from place to place so constantly. Where's everyone at mentally?
2311.36 2318.44 speaker2  Which room are we in? I'm on the lake. I'm still on the lake.
2314.44 2319.44 speaker3  And yet you're standing in this room and you have this spray bottle in your hand.
2318.44 2323.96 speaker2  Which room are we in again? The meeting room. And did Angela just close the door on us?
2322.52 2331.20 speaker3  Well, Angela's not in here.
2328.80 2334.20 speaker4  I think the whole point is to determine that sort of thing. Do you?
2333.20 2346.44 speaker2  Well, okay. I've got the spray bottle in my hand. I'm kicking open the outside door and I'm looking for any motherfucker who works here to spray.
2345.44 2361.58 speaker3  empty. You see that there is the desk on your left and there's the water cooler with the coffee machine on your right and it is dead silent and there's no one around. I want to look at Charles. Is he scalped?
2360.58 2362.58 speaker1  Yes.
2361.58 2370.02 speaker2  I'm like... Oh, sorry.
2369.02 2380.70 speaker3  Like it's just like... The memory of pain or... yet you feel hair.
2379.70 2382.70 speaker1  No, you're fine.
2381.70 2390.18 speaker4  You're fine.
2388.70 2399.10 speaker1  I'm like, oh, my fucking back. And I'm like, look, look, look at it. My back shirt up. I look at it.
2398.10 2402.10 speaker4  You're fine. You're fine.
2401.10 2409.10 speaker3  Calm down. Calm down. You're fine. Oh, God. As you lift it up though, you do notice that you have the little mark on the inside of
2408.10 2416.50 speaker1  Do you... Do you... Do you have this? I...
2415.50 2418.50 speaker4  Yeah.
2417.50 2450.40 speaker3  We... Walter and I, we were throwing rocks. We were trying to... And he holds up his arm and pulls up his shirt and there's a mark on the inside, little blood dried up. Fail. You do not find a gun.
2447.68 2453.40 speaker1  I have a question to ask Zach that they shouldn't listen to. Oh, okay.
2452.40 2459.72 speaker3  Thomas. Why don't you just ask him?
2458.72 2470.92 speaker1  You remember everything.
2469.92 2475.92 speaker3  What did you touch?
2473.92 2496.64 speaker1  Just echo, echo, echo. Can I roll some kind of... Why, just spill your beans. Can I roll some kind of search to see if there's been a trace of someone in here or does it look totally untouched?
2491.22 2528.32 speaker3  It's as if when you first came in to a calm, comfy campground, there was no one in the lobby. It's exactly like that. you're trying to find.
2524.04 2543.08 speaker1  Oh, no, I got a 69, which does that a crit success? That is a crit success. Crit success. Whatever this is.
2541.28 2554.68 speaker2  what's going on.
2550.92 2579.28 speaker3  way a little bit as you found this secret door. And as you push into it, this room opens up, and looking into it, it is a long, long room. You can't see the end of it, and it is lit by the floor, and the darkness is coming from above, and there's these shadows of all these metal shelves, and you have opened up a secret
2577.08 2581.20 speaker4  Geographically, where is this room?
2579.28 2588.16 speaker3  It's just around the corner from the meeting room. It was down a slight hallway from where you guys were.
2584.88 2614.60 speaker2  Sure, but if the island is the face of the clock, what time is it at? We're in the center. Two o'clock. What? It's at two o'clock from the center? It doesn't matter. Then why is the island the face of the clock? Yeah, 50-50. I don't. Aww. This is that room.
2613.60 2635.28 speaker4  Do you guys remember that? Do you remember the room with all the tapes?
2634.28 2637.88 speaker2  towards the boat docks.
2636.60 2644.04 speaker3  Searching for a tape player.
2642.24 2649.12 speaker1  I want to try and find our shelves again. Yeah, I'll go with it. Or is it so gargantuan?
2646.28 2656.08 speaker3  I mean, looking into it, it is infinite and vast. But you can try if you want. Roger Fairfield, what are you doing?
2653.76 2684.20 speaker4  I don't know what Roger would do right now. He's freaked out, but he doesn't... I don't think he would run for the boats. I think the boats are the last thing he wants to be on. I'm like, I don't want to even try to go back there. He's going to yell for Angela and then maybe go into that back office that we saw James Angie!
2679.76 2722.20 speaker3  That begins to echo out and just reverberate and repeat. Walter and Alan Grimes, Charles Digby, Roger Fairfield, and Martin Cupertino, you are all walking through the woods. You're surrounded by trees. You're running through the woods. You're running through the woods. trying to find the door. Charles Digby, you feel blood rushing down your face. He rolled a four.
2721.20 2745.20 speaker2  Quick math. The fuck up, John.
2741.20 2761.18 speaker1  Before that, I assume I'm wearing an over shirt or something. Can I tear it up to make a weird little bandage for my head, like a little hat for my head? Yes, absolutely you can.
2760.18 2781.74 speaker2  It'll be survival. Does anybody have a good survival? you could figure out what it was telling you. That's still better than survival. What's your survival?
2780.74 2797.02 speaker4  It's part of my job. It's part of what I do. I can read it for you. I can navigate it. My wife-wife is my wife. Can we trust you? It's my wife. I don't know where she is. Hey, ease up on him.
2795.38 2800.74 speaker1  He can still read the fucking map.
2799.74 2806.74 speaker4  Tough shit.
2805.74 2815.74 speaker1  Hey, Joe.
2813.02 2823.46 speaker4  You gave me a not yes.
2822.46 2838.06 speaker3  Okay. Press him, baby.
2837.06 2869.58 speaker4  My wife is real. We've been together for... We've been together for... I met her. I don't... I was... I was talking to James and he asked if I was single. I said yes. I said yes. I said yes. I don't... Who's... I don't... I don't... I don't have a wife. I don't have a wife! Hey, buddy.
2868.58 2871.58 speaker2  Can you help us get there?
2870.58 2873.58 speaker1  Yeah.
2872.58 2877.58 speaker4  Yeah. Yeah.
2876.58 2886.58 speaker2  We gotta get out of here. I don't know who she is. I don't know who she is. Okay.
2885.58 2892.58 speaker3  Just calm down. The answers are on the other side of the door on this map. Okay. Now, here's the thing. So, when you guys roll, who is reading the map? Are both of you reading the map?
2891.58 2899.00 speaker2  I think...
2893.58 2910.38 speaker3  I need you both to roll into my little box that I'm holding. It's Joe's dice rolling box. And I need you guys to roll into it and not see the result.
2909.38 2919.98 speaker1  Because...
2918.98 2927.02 speaker3  you should go. I don't want you to know whether you've read the map successfully or not, so I want you both to roll into this.
2926.02 2933.02 speaker2  Okay. Cool excuse, but...
2932.02 2939.74 speaker4  Look.
2938.74 3004.94 speaker3  30. Okay. And what do you have for survival? 40. And you notice directly across from you on the line where you are heading from off the trail toward the door, you're about 20 yards away from where you think the door is, there's a cave opening. And then above that, there's a slight opening in the trees that leads above the cave. Roger Fairfield, you're pretty positive that this map is leading you into the cave and then out through the door. We don't know.
3003.94 3011.02 speaker2  Okay, so how do we feel about how we did it?
3009.02 3014.42 speaker4  One of them critically failed. Oh no. Listen.
3013.02 3020.94 speaker2  We need to go through those trees.
3019.94 3025.70 speaker4  the time. It's through the cave.
3024.70 3034.94 speaker2  We all drive somewhere. It's not like you're a fucking mapologist.
3033.94 3040.46 speaker4  it's through the cave.
3037.26 3044.86 speaker2  Why the fuck would we get out of the forest through a cave instead of going through the
3043.48 3054.42 speaker4  There's no door here. It's all symbolic. There's got to be another entry on the other side of the cave. It's our way out.
3052.88 3102.62 speaker2  You figure it out for yourselves. Don't go into the caves? You need to figure out which group you're in.
3099.34 3111.78 speaker1  I know what I think is happening.
3110.66 3123.86 speaker3  Look at me. I don't know what we were before this. Do you have the memory of us in the flower room?
3120.94 3140.46 speaker2  It's time for me to go on my own.
3136.22 3150.38 speaker3  In this one, there will be in the next one.
3145.90 3168.58 speaker2  Why are all the player characters going to die?
3163.66 3180.62 speaker3  If you turn back, you see a single tear is falling from his eye.
3177.06 3197.22 speaker2  I'll see you at the end, dad. I don't want that loser going with me.
3193.22 3202.06 speaker3  to offend anyone, but clearly not wanted by either group. Yeah.
3198.22 3237.18 speaker2  Go into the caves, you feckless, perhaps sunless piece of shit. Jesus Christ. the fuck out of there.
3232.34 3249.20 speaker3  As you're saying that to each other, he is walking back down the trail away from you all back toward like calm.
3247.66 3264.30 speaker2  It fills you. I like get down, like drop to my knees and I actually start to cry.
3262.30 3270.46 speaker3  Watch your electronics.
3266.90 3278.26 speaker4  He wasn't, it sounds like he wasn't really your dad or something.
3274.94 3282.46 speaker2  I, there's just so much going on. I just can't compute it all.
3281.46 3290.94 speaker4  Roger's going to try and comfort you. I mean, there's this kid crying in front of him.
3289.94 3303.84 speaker1  Like his pet cat. He's like, it'll be okay, but he does like a pat on the head and he's like, Hey, Hey, Hey, it'll be okay.
3302.38 3308.46 speaker4  I've got a little bit of persuade.
3306.38 3324.46 speaker3  So psychotherapy would be comfort. I don't have any of that. You got 10%.
3323.46 3328.46 speaker4  Yeah. Yeah.
3327.46 3378.46 speaker1  Yeah.
3376.62 3401.70 speaker3  Who's leading the charge into this cave. I assume it's Roger Fairfield.
3396.42 3416.48 speaker2  look over and for a split second I try to decide if I'm going to the cave or running after my dad, but I realized I've made that decision. I get up and there's like dirt and mud all over my face and I start following them into
3410.86 3425.70 speaker3  The cave opening is large enough for two or three people to go in at a time. It's not too small. There are a lot of caves around here in Missouri that the entrance to the cave is literally like you dive in head first and your feet go in the air.
3424.70 3445.38 speaker2  It's not one of those. It's like the smallest cave.
3437.38 3505.74 speaker3  the palms behind you kind of into it and scooch on your butt into a pretty large opening immediately where you hear the drops of water and the distance. And besides that, you hear nothing. This cave system is moist. Do we have mites and tights? You got mites and tights for days. Far more tights than mites at this first opening area. So you're kind of dodging them with your mouth and making sure that no of the drip drops get in your grill as you, as you scooch down in. But then you can kind of stand up and you're standing on this. It's both, I would say it's both, it's smooth and wet and there's a line down the middle and you can kind of like put one foot on each side as you move forward. And the light behind you is the only thing guiding you for now. Do you guys have any lighters or anything on you? I'd assume Charles Digby might be a smoker, but that's just an assumption.
3504.74 3514.40 speaker1  Yeah. Because he went to be incognito. Exactly. He smokes a lot.
3513.40 3547.48 speaker2  Like what? Forearm phasing up, palm up. some light.
3542.64 3553.76 speaker3  You guys look over and Walter is holding his thumb over the crook of his elbow and he's like blinking really intensely and he's confused.
3552.76 3582.60 speaker1  What? Are you, what are you doing there? I look at Roger and I was like, this kid's got some fucking screws loose.
3575.84 3598.48 speaker3  of you and there it, it gets smaller and smaller and the distance about 25 yards away. And then there's another opening down there and you, uh, you see there seems to be a path laid out from here to there. Almost like people have been through here before.
3594.56 3632.40 speaker1  I'll lead the way and I hold the lighter kind of in front while guiding them. I'll follow. go a certain way or is it still air? It is still air.
3631.04 3635.08 speaker2  Let's just forge on.
3632.40 3646.08 speaker4  Yeah, let's press on I guess. Yeah. I think Roger right now is a little bit maybe wondering if he read the map right, but he's
3641.04 3678.96 speaker3  So you guys go into this next little opening and there is a slide down. It's a, there's a bunch of different rocks and stuff, but it's been smoothed out over time. There seems to be water trickling in this area just to your left and just to your right, but there's a rock kind of stairway leading down a little bit and you notice that you're now in a room that is probably 40 yards by 40 yards and at least 40 yards high as well. And you're like up at the top currently looking down into it.
3675.40 3693.56 speaker4  And earlier you said that there are signs that this is a used pathway. There's, there's, there's signs that people have been through here. Everyone has to be down here. Let's, let's keep going.
3692.56 3696.56 speaker1  Without your hair.
3695.56 3727.48 speaker4  How's that? How's that feeling? Feels bad.
3725.92 3761.72 speaker3  are getting muddier and muddier. It's much cooler now than it was when you were out back in the woods. Obviously you're in a fucking cave, roughly 52 degrees is what I'm thinking Fahrenheit. I was just watching a formula, it doesn't matter, but I was watching drive to survive the formula one Netflix show and they were like, yeah, it's fucking hot. It's 32 degrees. And I was like, ah, Americans, we're idiots. Whoops. Anyway, so you guys make it down and it is for our international listeners.
3760.72 3775.12 speaker2  That's 11.1 degrees.
3768.12 3807.52 speaker1  As we're wandering around and passing the time, I'm like, Hey bud, why do you, do you think you're a robot? We need to, if he's going to be with us, we got to know what's happening upstairs with him. He's right. Were you pressing into your arm? What were you doing? I'm not supposed to say, I think you should say, I saw whenever we were in that meeting room together, you like shut down when someone touched under your chin. What was that?
3806.52 3901.88 speaker4  Yeah. I am. We're pretty sure now that he isn't your dad. Is that, isn't that right? You think he made you? I know that he did. He built you. I don't think he built you. Walter. You're, you're not a maid thing. I was programmed to feel, oh boy. When you got touched under the chin and you shut down, what did that feel like to you? You just closed your eyes, but what did you think happened? I shut down.
3894.88 4066.12 speaker3  You're in a cage and you're in a warehouse and it smells, it's fucking musty. Like a junior high locker room that was abandoned over summer break. This warehouse is filled with these cages, cramped, rusty, covered in a layer of condensation due to the humidity. And each cage has a kid in it, roughly your age. And there must be hundreds of you all stacked three cages high, separated just enough to is Alan Grimes, followed by a few men who are hanging on his every word. Others had parents who were more than willing to trade them for drugs. And that's where the learning center comes in. These kids have no place in this world. They do not exist. Uh. And the camera zooms out as we see Walter Grimes just clawing, mud, pulling up in his nail beds as he's trying to get through this wall. And we see Charles Digby and Roger Fairfield just take a step back and watch. And you are now in this even larger room. You can roll search if you want. I do. Search or survival? here that kind of like carved out stairs that made you think that this has been traveled before are no longer there. And it is just a smooth slide that goes at like an 11 degree angle straight up and then surrounding you on the other side are equally tall walls about 40 yards high and you are lit only by this very still flame that is casting each of your shadows onto these walls surrounding you. Roll Sanity. Uh oh.
4065.12 4069.12 speaker2  Seven. This seems fine.
4068.12 4072.12 speaker4  I'm fine too.
4071.12 4080.36 speaker3  Oh shit. Then yeah, you guys are fine. You just can't, you just can't see it right now, but you just haven't found it yet. It's no big deal.
4079.36 4085.36 speaker4  Uh, yeah. Roger is going to start running his hand on the nearest wall and going in a perimeter.
4084.36 4089.64 speaker3  We'll find, I'll find it eventually. Yeah, exactly.
4087.36 4092.64 speaker1  We're kind of like, Oh, I feel like since it's so, is it just like pitch black except the lighter? Exactly.
4091.64 4130.24 speaker3  Have you guys read yellow wallpaper? The short story? A long time ago. Yeah. This is reminding me very much of this. So I will just cut to a scene where the three of you are all like conga line style basically with the lighter in front, holding your hands up to the wall. Exactly. And as we pan out, we see that the handprints that have been going around this room have been going time and time and time and time in memoriam and you've made smooth hand prints
4124.08 4151.56 speaker4  all across this wall repeatedly for who knows how long. Holy fucking shit. Fuck.
4148.40 4152.56 speaker3  cave off through the opening in the trees?
4151.56 4164.44 speaker2  Nothing in particular. He's just completely, he doesn't have a single doubt about his own rightness.
4163.04 4166.88 speaker3  Literally.
4165.88 4177.88 speaker2  Yeah. I can see like forest through the other side, but I bulk it. Yeah.
4175.92 4182.20 speaker3  you can't quite move through. Okay.
4178.88 4199.88 speaker2  I would like to meditate and get in tune with this energy. Full power. 23 on a 50.
4193.46 4231.32 speaker3  see where this wall goes up and looking up behind you, you see that it creates a dome over the sky above you and you're on the very edge of it now. And just to your right, there's a little opening where there is no energy. As you walk through the opening, this headache that you didn't even realize that you necessarily had just dissipates and you feel free for the first time and you don't know how long. And you do exactly what Thomas just did, which was exhale and like roll your eyes back in
4229.32 4245.04 speaker2  the head. Pleasure. Okay.
4243.12 4267.04 speaker3  Why do you sound like Jack Russell? Everyone knows that.
4265.92 4301.12 speaker2  Perfect. I'm still 26 years in the future. Well, 26.3. That's what I've calculated. It's cube about to launch.
4296.24 4334.48 speaker3  Roger Fairfield, Charles Digby, Alan Grimes and Walter Grimes, you're all sitting in a half circle in the meeting room about to have orientation and a man walks in wearing a white button down shirt, gray slacks and black dress shoes and he sits at the chair in front of Welcome to calm, comfy campground.
4332.68 4354.96 speaker4  I don't understand.
4353.92 4509.04 speaker3  It's Zach. Before I address how we're handling it here at pretending to be people, I just want to say we wish you all the best during these unprecedented times for me personally, yesterday COVID-19 hit a bit closer to home than I'd have liked. My dad had just finished a 14 day quarantine after coming into contact with someone who is Corona positive and the symptoms hit him like a truck on day 15. This thing is real and it fucking sucks. Please stay home, wash your hands and if you're young and staying safe, please offer to make grocery and pharmacy runs for the older and immunocompromised in your lives. We can make it through this mess together. I know it's hard to stop touching your face, so maybe wear gloves that you've dipped into spoiled milk and let dry in the sun. Maybe that. So we are currently waiting on the rest of our equipment to come in the mail so we can begin recording remotely. We've never done this before, so we might be taking a week off to figure out the logistics, but my hope is to put out this Q and A episode Friday, April 3rd. So post those questions on the thread in the subreddit ASAP and as for our patrons over on Patreon, I will make an announcement once all our equipment is in and we have everything set up and we know what we're actually doing, but we are so looking forward to making your patronage really worth its belt size. For those of you who don't know, I work as the director of human resources and community outreach for a small business that owns five bars and I bartend a couple nights a week as well for extra money. These moments of crisis bring out a compassion and empathy in people that is so heartening. So if you have the ability, please take this time. Reach out to an elderly neighbor, Venmo a friend who's in the service industry, Zoom to see what happens. I love you all, thank you so much for listening and supporting the show. Thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
