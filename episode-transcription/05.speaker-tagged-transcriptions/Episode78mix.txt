0.00 199.88 speaker0  I'm feeling like a damn sandwich here, y'all. I am the meat that is between the good numbers six and nine, the bridge between the celestial numerals that make us all feel so nice. That's right, y'all, this is episode 78. And I'm building a bridge of vocal vibrations live from 694.2 PTBP. The numbers always tell the truth, especially when they are the good numbers, the nice numbers. Speaking of numbers, we got one special message from one very special listener. This week's Howler with Wolf is from Zach, who tagged that pretending pod on his Instagram story for once. He writes, Hey Wolf, long time listener, first time Howler. Howler howls. Did you do it? Did you howl? Okay, now I want to hear you do a real long howl. And it starts real confident, like you're the only wolf in the whole dumpster. But then as the howl goes on, you become less and less sure of yourself. Like you're stoned and underdressed at a wedding that you weren't invited to until like the week before when you ran into your old friend's fiance at the coffee shop. And she invited you after acting like it was a total accident. You were left off the guest list in the first place. Now, do that now. Okay, thanks, love you, bye. P.S. Hey Joe, Justin, Luke, and Thomas, Now listen here, Zachary. I do not howl on command for any man, except for beautiful trash beings who wish to roll in the filth with me, you dig? but that has never stopped me from enjoying myself to the fullest. Emphasis on the moan. I love you too, Zach. And one day I will eat your soul, but before I do, I'll give you a little forehead kiss. Stop it, stop what you're doing right now. and put down the damn quesadilla. Go to Twitter, search at pretending pod. Go to Instagram, search at pretending pod. It's literally the exact same thing that Jesus told his bro-mies. Put down the quesadilla and follow me. Or keep just listening, I guess, but don't disappoint ol' Wolfie like that. Tell your online friends about the show and tag at pretending pod. In terms of perspective, let's try to look at this from Drew's. It's time for the news. Drew drove to the city in the midst of a reconstruction of contention that implemented puddle teaming, the act of placing small man-made pools filled with fish around town. Drew admitted he didn't come up with this plan. Rather, it was Pastor Adam Kane
196.60 212.32 speaker1  Drew chastised the officers for leaving contention during this phenomenally strange and harrowing time, but John Lee Pettymore the 3rd saw a vision of Drew bringing the radio, helmet,
210.32 242.56 speaker0  to the First Church of Contention, and he freaked out on Drew for turning on his coworkers until Drew showed them a round scar on his belly from where he had been tortured. When they patted down Drew, they found a bloody piece of cheap carpet. Drew told them, deadpan, that choking on the carpet until he almost died was how he found them. It didn't take long for the former contingent police officers to torture Drew as well,
239.68 251.68 speaker1  by telling them where Tildy B. Mitchell is.
249.84 308.92 speaker0  Clark chased after him, and Tyler, Kerry Page's energetic black lab, came bounding toward the group from behind a barn, taking us now to Clark's oldest loose end. Honk if you know this, Wolf's boldest goose friend. It's a brand new hit, a lone crack tone. It's kazoo with no backbone. Yeah, it's a new episode.
307.24 321.76 speaker1  Oh, behind the scenes. Everybody listening out there. It hasn't been a whole week What have you guys been up to
320.04 325.18 speaker2  since we recorded the last episode?
323.18 333.04 speaker1  I've been reading drill tweets. I took a stroll over the restroom over there and came back. It was a good jaunt.
331.28 337.24 speaker2  I opened up another bubbly. What flavor? It's aha, it's strawberry cucumber.
336.32 339.16 speaker1  Who makes aha? Who makes aha?
338.32 345.92 speaker2  I don't care.
344.46 376.16 speaker1  I haven't tried it yet, though, but I hadn't seen that flavor before. I haven't seen that either. Yeah, cran-raz. I could've sworn that the package said cran-raz, but this says razz cranberry. It did a reverse of the thing. Ooh, that's a crisp one ripping the head off of that bad boy. Oh, it's foaming everywhere.
373.00 395.28 speaker2  while he shakes his golden locks back and forth. Wow. here at Pretending To Be People. You guys have had a week to think on what happened in the last episode. Any thoughts pop up?
393.08 409.24 speaker1  and Clark at the same time. So I've been preparing. I've been going in and out of character as fast as I can. Can we see some of that? No.
407.28 416.72 speaker2  It's good to see the Contingent Boys.
415.88 419.36 speaker1  It's flawless, right?
416.72 431.68 speaker2  Contrast really makes Clark Bishop's voice. How did Tyler get up here?
430.36 451.94 speaker1  It was like a dirt road, right? was that the date? What date did that take place on? Do you remember? I think it was December 5th.
449.82 457.82 speaker2  Well, Luke, it's been a whole week since the last episode. What have you thought about in the past week
453.70 486.26 speaker1  about what is happening and what you should do on this one? You know, not much. I wasn't trying to be mean to him,
482.66 493.78 speaker2  Alrighty, well you guys are in the misery business, so let's open up shop. Tyler!
491.16 500.92 speaker1  Is that Tyler? That's it, it's right there.
499.34 532.42 speaker2  I pat Clark in the back and says, looks like you found him. Hey Drew, how do you know who Tyler is? You all can see Drew Andrews just filled brimming with affection. Well, Tyler's just the greatest dog in the world but, I mean, he's Councilman Kerry Page's dog, right? Drew, that's correct, it's weird though
531.50 554.98 speaker1  that you just said. John, I mean, I did put signs all over the neighborhood. He probably saw it on the copier or something.
552.58 558.70 speaker2  I saw the pictures on the copier. Okay, everybody roll humant.
557.86 580.88 speaker1  Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna kick you out, Drew.
580.04 637.16 speaker2  Yo. Zach. Thomas, John Lee Pettymore especially, when you hear Drew talking about Tyler, it's not Drew, that's not Drew talking about Tyler. It's not his voice, it's not his cadence. I mean, it is his voice, but it's not his personality that's coming through. Damn it, didn't I spend 10 luck to try to figure out if this was Drew or not? and I answered that question more so instead of like, is it Drew as a question? Whatever, I made my choice.
634.48 646.42 speaker3  that you saw on a poster.
643.22 661.10 speaker2  because he was really worried about not finding that dog because Councilwoman Carrie Pages is a very respected person in the contention community. Thank you not to interrupt me right now, please.
658.14 670.02 speaker3  based off a black and white picture from a poster. That could be any dog, this doesn't add up.
668.14 714.74 speaker2  I feel like that doesn't discredit it. that you've never met. You seem to have genuine affection is an excellent member of our community and the fact that she has a dog means that that dog must be one of the greatest dogs that could be around for sure. Yeah, what? what, Clark Bishop's eyes widen. I need everybody to roll sanity.
712.78 723.12 speaker1  I also fail, but not over my power.
721.42 744.26 speaker2  I believe still in handcuffs. Oh yeah, he's still in handcuffs. Drew gets down on his knees and starts like nuzzling as Tyler runs right up and begins kissing
742.18 758.36 speaker1  They called, yeah, you, what? Councilwoman Pages, how the hell did you get What, what?
755.44 786.30 speaker2  to contention and I didn't think that this was gonna be that much of an issue. Jesus, it's like with you people and I'm just glad that Tyler is here. If you would, if you would just come back, It's just that we needed your help and we didn't know exactly how to get it and so we just need, we figured Drew might be the best way to get you guys to come back.
782.76 793.90 speaker3  but I don't take very kindly to tricks being played on me. I'm sorry. I don't like it.
792.20 804.80 speaker1  a lot of math in his head.
803.96 810.80 speaker3  Is he okay?
808.52 821.06 speaker2  If you ever wanna see Drew Andrews again, you're gonna come back to contention with me.
818.26 827.50 speaker1  So you had to switch his body with yours?
825.30 838.18 speaker3  Yeah, I was gonna say I punch him in the gut where that wound was.
836.26 856.38 speaker2  Please don't hurt me, I'll do it. I'll even act like you guys don't even know Drew anymore. I didn't think about this. There's three of you, there's only one of me. Please just don't hurt Tyler and we could all go back to contention and I can help you, I can help you. I can help you, thank you. Council woman, first of all, we're not gonna hurt Tyler,
855.26 858.82 speaker3  Well, that would be hurting him
857.98 862.98 speaker2  I don't know. I think he'd be real happy
860.70 870.38 speaker1  after we fed him steaks for a few days. You wouldn't. He might forget all about you.
868.14 874.74 speaker3  why don't you tell us what the preacher wants?
873.90 896.92 speaker2  Can I humid that? So that there's no more out in contention so that we can pull away all the puddles and we can open up contention again.
895.00 908.04 speaker3  and then do nothing with it? How can he keep it safe, contained? I think we gotta go talk to this guy. You never stopped to think, did you?
906.80 911.38 speaker1  Drew, Carrie? Drew, Drew, Drew. Drew, Drew, Drew.
910.54 918.34 speaker4  Drew, Drew, Drew. Drew, Drew, Drew. I was trying not to laugh.
915.50 927.64 speaker2  where everything is made up and the roles don't matter.
924.48 950.52 speaker1  with a radio that had tubes on it by, I assume, Pastor Adam Kane. Was this all just like a Tuesday afternoon for you? How did you react to all the... Are you aware of the world around you that you've now entered?
948.66 962.12 speaker2  we decided that we needed to team up to make change happen, something substantial that could actually take care of business in this time.
960.10 975.88 speaker1  Carrie, walk me through the day that Pastor Adam Kane said to you, I need you to switch bodies with this guy here using this radio. How did that set with you? That was just earlier today,
973.52 997.90 speaker2  so I don't know if you've noticed, but the world is different now, and you either adapt or you die. Oh, we know.
996.08 1013.28 speaker3  All right, so how about this? What if we, you know, we're gonna send Tyler away, somewhere where you can never find him and you'll never see him again. Now, we're not gonna hurt him,
1011.16 1019.68 speaker2  That's what I said I would do. Yes, we're on the same page. Well, I know. It was your idea.
1018.76 1042.20 speaker3  I just want you to know that that's the leverage we have against you, is that you won't ever see your dog again. This brief reunion will be merely a painful moment in time in which you get to see what might've been. Drew and Tyler have their heads,
1037.28 1052.40 speaker2  Drew kind of like does one final push into Tyler's forehead and then leans back and looks you dead in the eyes and is like, I will do anything to be, I will do anything to keep Tyler safe. That's what I like to hear.
1050.32 1079.58 speaker3  Boys, I think we ought to head back to contention. It sounds like there's even more trouble brewing down there. Yeah, old Trent left it there. I think Grand Theft Auto is, or tampering with a motor vehicle get back in the passenger seat and look at the guys. Who's driving?
1078.42 1085.28 speaker1  Let's put her in the trunk
1084.44 1089.78 speaker2  I'll drive. Are you keeping Drew tied up? Are you keeping him handcuffed? Yes.
1088.82 1094.54 speaker3  And are you doing anything with his legs? Leg cuffed. Yep.
1092.36 1100.50 speaker1  It seems like that might cause more trouble than it helps. He's gonna be able to be mobile when we get places.
1098.52 1115.10 speaker3  We're driving back, we're halfway to contention. he might be able to kick his way out. But if we leg cuff him, then all he can do is wiggle like an ineffective worm
1111.34 1130.50 speaker2  Handcuffs with attached ankle cuffs were pretty common in the 70s. So that's what Clark has on his old school contention police officer uniform.
1129.42 1136.62 speaker3  handcuffs on his ankles, and then two handcuffs connecting those handcuffs like behind his back like a hog tied.
1135.78 1144.58 speaker1  Yeah.
1142.66 1147.80 speaker3  There's something I really need to show you.
1145.66 1158.40 speaker1  We're in charge of our own destinies.
1156.42 1186.08 speaker3  and show you guys this for a minute. Let's just do it. He's probably ripped up the carpet or peed and pooped in there. I don't know if he even has food left. Not really though, I love Bean. All right, let's go to contention.
1184.00 1243.30 speaker2  and the small town of contention, if it truly can be called a highway, the part nearest to contention hasn't seen road repair in decades. Those from contention know to forfeit the radio during certain stretches of road because the rough old concrete is so loud, the damage to the speakers as well as to your ears What you're not used to is a blockade made of splintered church pews stopping you from exiting and the sign from Subtropolis torn down and spray painted. It's like leaning up against this blockade, has a big arrow to the right and says, detour, please keep right. I need you all to roll alertness or search, whichever's higher or Thomas, you can roll drive if that one's higher in order to see this in time to do anything about it.
1241.88 1245.94 speaker3  I feel like this is a trap.
1245.10 1249.46 speaker1  I fail.
1247.62 1266.60 speaker3  I rolled a 35 on a 70 drive. So I just, I slow to a stop before we have to turn off and I say something doesn't feel right. I think we're about to get children of mend.
1262.52 1302.60 speaker2  some crunchy December grass and onto the service road, just to the right, just to the north of the exit ramp. But there is certainly some sort of situation set up on this service road. A crane sits off to the side of this makeshift entrance to contention. It's boom and jib hanging over the middle of the road where its payload sits. A substitute gate made of those big ass construction tubes. So basically the crane is there to let cars into contention by lifting all these tubes.
1300.80 1307.90 speaker3  No, the big concrete. Big plastic tubes.
1306.10 1323.08 speaker1  they would go rolling across the road It's just the exit ramp that has all this construction going on, right? So we could keep going down the highway unobstructed, come around maybe the backside or something like that.
1322.10 1358.52 speaker3  Fuck the detour. We look for a back way into town. Yeah. Or at least one that doesn't have a giant crane in the way. then it stands to reason that the others are probably less secure than this. has explicitly said to not let us in. I think we're the cops is about the worst thing that could come out of anyone's mouth trying to get in. Like why the fuck did you leave? Why aren't you here in the first place?
1357.30 1364.90 speaker1  But doesn't it kind of sound like Pastor Adam Cain's running the show now and he wants us?
1363.66 1369.02 speaker3  that'd be the best for now.
1366.02 1375.58 speaker1  I'm just saying I think if push came to shove,
1371.10 1386.30 speaker3  Let's try to find another way around and get to my hotel.
1383.82 1389.58 speaker2  might be one of the harder places to get into. I see what you mean.
1387.86 1417.88 speaker3  Yeah, it's right by the exit. We don't have to drive anywhere. Let's just pull, let's go back down the highway the way we came a little bit, pull off the side of the road and then just walk to the Hotel Motel. No, we're leaving Drew Carey in the trunk, but we're taking Tyler with us.
1412.88 1426.32 speaker1  was that she was gonna be on our side and help us now because we threatened her dog.
1423.62 1453.30 speaker3  it just seems like she's more of a liability while we run a dude Drew's thing real quick. Yeah, it feels like the safest place for her to be Yeah, we're just missing in and out. I just gotta get something. Okay, yeah. You can, somebody can stay here and guard, guard him, them if you want, but I don't know. Let's just all go and make it real quick
1452.34 1466.58 speaker1  Here's my only fear, is that things don't seem to go well for us. So what if Drew Carey's trapped in the trunk for a while?
1462.80 1470.96 speaker3  a pawn of this evil goo like a collecting pastor.
1469.30 1475.22 speaker1  Like, are we abandoning the idea that that could be helpful to us?
1472.70 1489.88 speaker3  Right now, I think she's the most helpful in that trunk. If she feels like she's in a situation where we're leading her, trying to be stealthy to the hotel, and she can just scream like, and sick a bunch of people on us. True.
1489.04 1496.12 speaker4  Okay.
1491.54 1504.24 speaker1  Let's go to the hotel on foot with Tyler, right? We're bringing Tyler with us? Yeah. Yeah. Clark goes around to the trunk and pats on it. We'll be right back.
1503.00 1506.54 speaker3  about getting out of there.
1505.72 1513.84 speaker2  Please, thank you. Tell me, please. Nope, nope. We don't want you,
1512.00 1525.80 speaker3  we don't want you leading them to us, so we'll be back within 15 minutes, half an hour, and you just sit tight. Clark's gonna be staying here with you, and then I wink at them.
1523.28 1532.36 speaker1  And I'm putting some headphones in, and I'm just gonna sit silently to myself in the front seat up there.
1530.52 1599.52 speaker3  so you don't disturb him or anything, or he won't be able to enjoy that. Great job. That's exactly right. You just don't say nothing. All right, let's go, boys. Boy. I meant Keith and Tyler. Is there anything in the car we can use to make a makeshift leash for Tyler? and I tie that around his collar. One sleeve tied around the collar, the other sleeve I'm holding on to. Okay. Cardigan leash. Cardigan leash. I love it. All right, Keith, you know, I probably should have humanted you or done something to make sure that your motives were good and leaning us But I didn't, so let's just get this over with. Okey-dokey, who's got the worst stealth? Mine's 50. Mine's 10. Oh my God. Why? I've got 30.
1596.88 1766.56 speaker2  if you guys succeed, you'll be able to assist by giving a plus 20 each on a success to Keith. 10. So that is a plus 20 to Keith's 10. Pettymore the 3rd, and Tyler are walking across the highway. I need everybody to roll alertness. Thomas, you see across the highway when you're like on the highway itself, it's the highest point that you've been at. And looking across the town of contention, there's not much of a skyline in contention, right? Not too many tall buildings here, but you do notice that surrounding what you know as the campus of First Church of Contention, there is, that doesn't look right, it can't, it's moving, it's a wall. You imagine this is what it looked like if Moses actually had parted the Red Sea, as you see a moat in the air that is surrounding the campus of the First Church of Contention. And in the water are many different kinds of fish that are all swimming about. I need you to roll sanity. Lose one sanity as you realize what you are going up against. This is the kind of unnatural that you have not witnessed something this controlled, right, like everything that you've seen has been just haphazard, seemingly chaotic. But this, this was formed and this is held. This is scary. That's what you're supposed to do in horror, right? Is you say, this is scary. This is scary. You're scared now. Do you feel it inside of you where you're scared? All right, I'm gonna, did you roll over your power? No.
1765.56 1790.54 speaker3  Yeah, immediately. and point to the first church of contention and I say, hey guys, take a look at what's going on around the church.
1789.70 1886.12 speaker2  No. So you each lose one sanity. Or like five. which is basically non-existent, I think the highest thing in the town previous to this was probably the church's cross on top of their steeple. Currently above that, you see a massive wall of water that is surrounding the entire land that the church sits on and it is exactly like what you think it might look like It's exactly what it would look like if you made a wall out of water and there are fish swimming all through it it's cool some of them literally jump out of the water and then gravity pulls them back in sideways into the wall of water. And oh, I forgot to mention, it's scary. You've never seen this kind of unnatural power controlled like this. It seems to not be chaotic, it is purposeful.
1883.72 1892.04 speaker1  Look at that, I gotta see this thing.
1889.96 1910.02 speaker3  and then we can go there. Yeah, Clark, that's kind of where all our, seemingly all our enemies are. I mean, except our human enemies, the ooze is its own thing. Yeah, see, Tyler agrees. We should just go run by the hotel real quick and check things out.
1908.74 1914.54 speaker1  close to it later on maybe.
1912.38 1915.92 speaker3  Oh yeah, we'll take them fish.
1914.54 1920.46 speaker1  That'd be neat as hell.
1919.62 1932.12 speaker3  You know it. Pick the pace up a little bit and start more than jogging towards the hotel. Yeah, I follow.
1928.00 1939.02 speaker2  you see that all the doors are open.
1937.62 1944.28 speaker3  tried to get into this room.
1943.44 1965.14 speaker1  in this one here. Yeah, can we reconstruct the series of events that happened here?
1960.34 2006.64 speaker2  and just wonderfully ignoring the scene that's in the parking lot of hotel motel which before you is, there's a dunking booth there's a young boy, a large boy with dumpling cheeks and rounded ears that accentuate the roundness of his face and he is slowly surveying the area with a furrowed brow above glassy, darting eyes while consistently stuffing his face with a cheesy ziti scooped up from a mixing bowl in his lap.
2004.16 2020.94 speaker3  It seems like this husky fella is some kind of lookout. They said they were using children and crazy folks to look out for the ooze. And see he's got his little tank of fish there in case it comes by.
2020.10 2042.30 speaker2  Seven. And you notice alongside that astute observation there is a walkie talkie that is mounted on the netting of this dunk tank What is the kid wearing?
2039.94 2055.16 speaker1  I'm mostly asking, is he wearing like a swimsuit so that he would be happy to be dunked or is he just wearing civilian clothing?
2052.00 2075.62 speaker3  Like Meatwad and some awkward teen hunger force. It's just a thing. So what happens? We tell you what happens. Seems like he could alert the church to our presence so we might wanna, we might wanna duck down.
2074.78 2084.98 speaker4  Yeah, you could draw stealth.
2082.14 2087.94 speaker3  Like does it have a target that we could hit
2086.26 2091.64 speaker2  Yeah, let's say that it does.
2090.66 2126.72 speaker3  We could shoot. That's true. I've got a 60 firearms, what do you got? I'm feeling a little better than that. Well, I mean, what's your plan here? If we dunk him, he's gonna say that he got dunked He won't necessarily see what dunked him. That's true. And if you, you know, fuck up and hit the kid, then we don't really have a problem either way, so. That's true.
2123.72 2130.80 speaker1  another option is that we're here to get something from Keith. Just shoot the kid instead of fucking around with the dunk tank?
2129.34 2134.98 speaker3  You're right, you're right.
2133.26 2155.54 speaker1  you're not wearing a uniform or anything. Why don't you walk up there, show him, I guess, your hotel room key or whatever. I mean, he's looking out for goo, right? I mean, that's ostensibly what he's looking out for.
2152.70 2166.16 speaker3  I grab a big thing of mud and I just rub it all over your face where a beard would be. I allow it to happen.
2162.80 2173.92 speaker4  walk over to my hotel room. And if it helps, I do have some disguise points.
2172.24 2192.12 speaker3  and we'll see how Keith gets along. If he gets into any trouble with this boy, the boy's like, hey, that's Officer Vigna. You know, we'll dunk him or shoot him or do what we have to do. Exactly.
2190.12 2202.16 speaker1  I thought you meant take care of him like we dunk him. I'm not, I don't think I want to kill a kid today. Like I said, whatever we have to do,
2201.08 2211.88 speaker3  We've done through, we've, you know, we've gone through this, so I know you'll do what must be done when the time comes.
2209.24 2220.22 speaker1  It was a thing that happened that we were there for, but I wasn't, like I would've, I would've preferred it not to have happened, but I, I'm with you. We're here.
2218.30 2232.22 speaker3  We're on the exact same page, buddy.
2230.54 2237.10 speaker1  and then a face of maybe shock.
2235.22 2243.38 speaker4  Yeah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
2240.46 2314.66 speaker2  very darting eyes of this total chub, look you up and down and then immediately pay you no mind as he continues to survey the land. And you walk into a room that has been ransacked. Bean is not here. has been busted out. So, hotel safes, motel safes. I think you can just pick them up, right? Some of them. It depends, yep. So, Luke, how much luck do you have? 35. That sucks. Go ahead and roll luck to see if your safe is in hotel motel. I was like, please roll. that would make it better. Oh, you don't have to, you don't have to, this kid is completely preoccupied when you come out with it.
2313.06 2317.26 speaker4  I'm like, I don't need the whole safe. Oh, right.
2315.78 2323.14 speaker2  Oh, shit, yeah, that's what I was thinking. I was like, okay, so Keith carries this safe out. Fuck me, so.
2321.38 2345.84 speaker4  Guys, look, the safe was still there. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. We didn't take it. We could put stuff in it. Are you glad we came? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. All right, do your thing. I open up the safe, take out the watch that I had put in there, I put it in my pocket, and I head back to the guys.
2342.64 2354.96 speaker2  because of your critical success, and you make it back, and Tyler greets you with a warm lick on the face.
2352.56 2372.12 speaker4  or go back to the car, but either way. I need you to see something. Well, one of you guys put this on, and I reach into my pocket and hold out the watch.
2370.22 2464.16 speaker2  and I'm gonna send the other two to the waiting room. Peace out. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. of John Lee Pettymore is changing the channel just like back and forth and back and forth all between these different scenes, and you begin to phase out of your reality as this watch slips onto your wrist, and you seem to be somewhere else entirely, and you feel wet grass and dirt on your fingers, and then the wet grass turns dry, so dry, and the dirt turns to dust, and you look up, and you see contention as an old mining town in the late 1800s, and you look next to you, and you see a man lying face down on the ground, not moving, and then all of a sudden, like a sealed metal door that was mostly buried, and on the door is an inscription, and it says, Pettymore Forevermore, and then the watch is slipped off of your wrist, and you come back to reality. John Lee Pettymore the third puts this watch on, and then quickly pulls the watch off his wrist.
2462.88 2481.14 speaker3  Keith, what the hell is this? What'd you see? I saw contention in its early days. I saw a man on the ground face down, and I saw a door. A door in the ground?
2479.82 2507.68 speaker4  Did it say anything on it? I saw a door in the ground, but it had beans on it.
2505.72 2524.40 speaker3  and I like slap it on your wrist.
2523.56 2592.50 speaker2  Hello. As Clark Bishop has this watch slapped on his wrist, it feels like your consciousness is just flipping through the channels, and you begin to phase out of your reality, and you're somewhere else entirely, and you feel wet grass and dirt on your fingers. The wet grass and dirt turns to dry, dry dust. And you've seen pictures of contention from the late 1800s, but you've never been there. And looking to your left, you see a man who's not moving face down on the ground next to you. You're back in this wet grass and dirt, and you see Maggie Cook's house, and in the backyard there's a door floating in the air. And then all of a sudden you're looking at this door that's mostly buried, sealed, metal door, and there's an inscription on it. It says one, five, two, two, five, one, eight, one, nine, five, five, one, eight, which you immediately can recognize as overseer.
2591.06 2611.90 speaker1  That's on the door in the ground? Yep. I mean, I kinda get it.
2608.70 2620.74 speaker2  onto Clark Bishop's wrist, and his eyes go blank, before the watch slips off the wrist and Clark Bishop looks at you.
2619.70 2627.78 speaker3  What did yours say?
2624.98 2635.02 speaker1  It was the numbers, it was numbers, it was. What numbers? It was the ones they spelled overseer.
2633.42 2645.02 speaker3  Oh, shit, well, that's you, Clark.
2642.98 2679.26 speaker1  I was standing out there in front of it. You know, she lives right there on Bean's Pond, and I saw a door, and it was floating above Bean's Pond, and then suddenly I was looking down at door in the ground, and that's where the numbers were. The numbers spelled out overseer, and I saw the dusty, it looked like really old contention, and there was that guy face down, like you said.
2675.32 2687.04 speaker4  Well, I saw my brother in Bean's Pond, but there was no water in it, and he was looking at a door in the ground
2684.72 2692.50 speaker1  If I interpreted my visions correctly, I think you're onto something. Bean's Pond is involved in some way.
2691.22 2699.42 speaker4  Before I brought it up, I wanted you guys to see that watch, but I think we need to go there.
2697.54 2705.54 speaker1  What do you guys think is the bigger fish that we need to fry?
2703.44 2708.98 speaker4  and we're not gonna be able to get much done.
2707.74 2714.30 speaker3  I don't know, boys. Maybe if we find the door, it'll help us.
2712.32 2729.96 speaker1  If we happen to choose wrong, we'll hopefully just reset, right? I mean. We got all the time in the world. I would hope so. In increments of two hours every day.
2727.60 2755.82 speaker3  Well, we were lucky to have gotten this far, I think. You know.
2752.98 2757.90 speaker4  It's been on my mind for days.
2755.82 2766.94 speaker3  Yeah, let's fucking knock on these doors. So we're heading to Bean's Pond, eh?
2763.16 2769.30 speaker4  but the water might be there, and I point to the wall.
2766.94 2774.76 speaker3  Have you put the watch on more than once, Keith?
2773.04 2780.40 speaker4  as soon as I took it off.
2778.24 2796.12 speaker3  if I put this on, will I have the same vision again or a different vision? we can move right along, but.
2793.56 2816.74 speaker4  and I take the watch and put it on one more time.
2809.08 2861.20 speaker2  over a man's body who's face down in the dry cracked dirt the smell of piss and shit wafts through the humid summer air and looking down the road to your perceived destination you recognize your hometown of contention back to the body on the ground your hands are trembling as you roll him over a dead man in his mid-20s stiff as a glass of moonshine dressed in the fashion of the day which is the late 1800s and a tri-folded piece of parchment falls out of this deceased man's jacket pocket it's a job advertisement for the contention mining company and it reads we is hiring able bodies readying untapped site plenty of work hesitate not bye
