708.38 715.82 speaker0  Now that that's cleared up we can talk imagine
711.58 736.98 speaker2  Imagine if that Zach had been sent to World War one dead so quickly
732.66 786.26 speaker0  But the episode where it took 20 fucking minutes to get to gameplay, let's do it, let's go bodega bodega Even though she had stolen the footage as she was leaving a couple of police officers not in Uniforms came out of a police car used police badges and stole the rest of the footage Including the thumb drive that she had stolen from Beck Wilder It got took took got took once
782.30 898.82 speaker2  Tom inks at the in the post-apocalyptic part of cloud atlas I think we need to go look at the security cameras at the office. Boom In Cal sick Mercedes we all vroom to the office. This is nice Cuz Cal always auto plays it That's based on a real guy Joe and I know Was absolutely obsessed with a b-minus movie I quickly autocorrected. I don't remember it other than I saw it and I was like you speak the true true It'd be so much better
893.74 901.62 speaker0  Let's go straight to the security office. We gotta see like if there was any like identifying Mars
898.82 917.34 speaker2  Maybe we could see the car that they drove. It was a police car Let's review the footage
914.62 949.26 speaker0  Can station you walk through the halls? I'm gonna need a grip check for you for the attire of some of your co-workers that you're passing through the hall
942.74 959.82 speaker2  Like like somebody who is trying to be as inconspicuous as possible and just get through this hallway to the other end
952.18 1020.30 speaker0  in the morning and you pass through the same way you always head to the can security office and as you guys pass in you See that's on shift today is ray. It's Raymond. It's the son Perhaps the the worse of the sons of tife He's watching tiktoks on his phone. He's just like
1014.66 1067.76 speaker2  Julius has never really liked ray ray so he goes over and he sees him screwing off and Just kind of like pushes his feet off the desk and makes his chair like swivel around school
1060.06 1088.16 speaker0  So what can you please just I just was wondering like maybe give me a little backup and he's like kind of spooling through It's all digital. So he's by spooling. I mean he's going backwards So you're probably looking at like 12 15 12 30 except it was like even later
1083.32 1095.72 speaker2  Because I went to the hospital cuz you're like everything's negative 40 if you do anything else
1093.72 1221.98 speaker0  We Here's you guys leaving? Beck is gonna push him out of the way because he knows how to use this equipment into the city action news station after you all have left looking over her shoulder the whole way through as she Crosses into the foyer. She digs deep into her pocket. She pulls out this thumb drive And there's this determined look in her not grainy face because it's pretty decent quality This quality is amazing even five years ago It shows it in there and heads back into the editing Bay surely in your minds to delete the footage or at least take it
1214.74 1269.04 speaker2  Actually had these people install some security in my home and both my my Peabody and three local Emmys were stolen in that time. I I could see the shame on her face. That was a present from my daughter She gave me a gift receipt in case I didn't want it that gift receipt was to a store called Target, huh? That's it. That's it. It was Target. Hmm. I love shopping in Target for all my holiday needs
1262.86 1357.86 speaker0  I I got you and back such wonderful presents two individuals walk through the doors one of these individuals They walk forward scoping out one takes the left side one takes the right side They're looking through the windows on either side. They see the editing Bay you follow them they head into the editing Bay Something it's weird. It's like Something that they're wearing maybe seems to be obvious skating their face It's like it's too well lit like pauperizing around their shirt paparazzi clothes
1354.58 1428.96 speaker2  Fuck, what is the bet? Well, who are the bad guys bad guys? Several weeks together in the in the mid 80s and and she employed a similar device against the paparazzo Oh Mamma Mia 2 here we go again mamma Mia 2 look who's talking now Ray Ray It's it's hard to see their faces That okay. Yes. I mean, I'm familiar. What would you google?
1427.56 1528.44 speaker0  anti face They're in there for a couple minutes They leave the editing bay just the two of them as they're walking out one does a classic like Catches it throws it back in the pocket they head back out to their police car the external camera on the building looks out and you see that this is CPD number eight three six. Oh, come on I should have asked you what number it was
1524.04 1553.92 speaker2  It seems like you guys would know more about how to like investigate things Maybe if we call one of the higher-ups we can get access to the buildings around us I have a couple of trusted contacts in the city police force They might be able to look these badge numbers up for me this car number
1553.60 1576.00 speaker0  Yeah
1570.80 1606.72 speaker2  Too obvious my contacts in the CPD prefer me to contact them more discreetly
1604.72 1630.84 speaker0  Intelligence or
1626.64 1686.90 speaker2  Classic thing where you go in for one thing and the deals are so hot you end up just You get your whole week's worth of stuff Yeah, and I know before Thanksgiving. I bought a stuffed felt turkey there
1681.74 1715.42 speaker0  Thai shitty son Raymond pulls his phone back out of his pocket and he's like Me and Deborah from traffic over here at City Action News are gonna head out to lunch
1710.66 1732.70 speaker2  Yeah, I had a real good dog named Murphy he used to sound like he was on everybody loves Raymond
1728.70 1837.44 speaker0  Oh my god. I just got that. I just understood the jerk As as Raymond starts talking about having lunch with Deborah from traffic at City Action News you think It's like three right now. Oh

1911.28 1992.48 speaker2  Julius slaps that on top of the car and gets in the back Yeah He wants to finish watching some of cloud atlas Cal Cal baby drivers into the the front seat and most Cal is like cows eyes are wide and he's speeding down like one of the main city like thoroughfares He's laughing and he turns to you guys. It was like, where are we going again?
1990.48 2135.08 speaker0  I 120 years ago twisted it says The city park. I Massive trees lining the roads on either side as you curve and make your way through this park You see picnic tables. You see ponds you see fountains You see a little boathouse where a dock has paddle boats the happy couples and families and Rangers Green dawn on either side past the the medical person there That's adjacent to the pond where there is a large statue of an old military general on a horse in front of a
2133.40 2141.68 speaker2  myriad ponds
2135.08 2190.50 speaker0  And there's there's some like duck boats that you can paddle as you pass the police officer that's on a bicycle He gives you a kind of stink eye as you head into the the double lanes you as you pass the bicycle It's the appropriate way to pass someone on a bicycle mind you but he gets a kind of hair But he chuckles and he says don't worry boys. We're off to meet that those bosses boss damn Cal
2188.78 2212.48 speaker1  Sorry
2207.96 2215.86 speaker0  He kind of looks over it back in the passenger seat looks it was starting to get the camera out
2212.60 2370.48 speaker2  looks at Julius and the in the back and he says um Unfortunately, there's only room for two on the on the goose paddle boats, but could you follow discreetly behind me? Also, give me one of your tik-tok phones and I could Julius gives him his tik-tok phone And Julius is stoked because he knows that he can paddle the shit out of these boats with his fucking huge legs Which it I turn on to work against my legs and this is my
2368.48 2386.80 speaker3  I
2379.80 2412.92 speaker0  Spectacle goose a platter arrives and is sat down in front of you. It's got a top on it. Would you do the honors Beck?
2407.92 2438.36 speaker2  And then like a charcuterie board, but it's mostly it's like two full summer sausages Like a big Slim Jim just snaps into
2436.36 2447.08 speaker3  Getting into a good angle
2442.52 2527.00 speaker2  Julius flips the motor in reverse and starts pedaling forward quickly Yes, of course any any taps is he taps his lapel and it's like a back. Can you hear me?
2526.04 2564.36 speaker0  Broad-shouldered gentleman with a big ol walrus Mustache that is gray and salt and pepper. What's his head look like shiny? Yeah
2560.76 2603.56 speaker2  But it still twitches weirdly like a walruses almost like whiskers By the way, this is a two-party consent state, so I
2600.46 2612.54 speaker3  That they on background on background. Is that what it is? Can't be quoted
