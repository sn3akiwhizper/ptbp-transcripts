He writes, Contention PD has issued a warning for residents to be on the lookout for a devilishly handsome 6 foot 1 British man with brown hair and brown eyes who goes by At Matt Makes Messes on Twitter. This individual has been seen being too attractive for his own damn good and CPD have warned not to approach this individual for fear of him talking to you about RPGs and other useless Department. Well Matt Makes Messes, you may be beautiful, you may be tall, heck you might even be British for all I know, but I'd like to see if you can make as big a mess as I can boy. I've made houses unlivable just by being near them, cleared out an entire neighborhood with the stank that my mess produces, I have made a dumpster behind an all-you-can-eat buffet, my residence, my kingdom, the rats gather around my grease-coated frame, I am the king of mess and you will respect and fear me as I sit atop my garbage throne.

374.42 387.78 speaker3  And if you're starting the podcast with this episode at any point in the future that's not like the fall, I suggest you just stop and wait a year, just wait until it's the
386.42 398.94 speaker2  spooky times. You gotta know where we're coming from and you're just not gonna get it otherwise.
396.90 411.78 speaker3  would be the best way to go about this. That's true. That's true. It'd be hard. If you can. I appear in this room right now.
410.78 415.78 speaker2  Ooh. Oh my god. Whoa.
414.78 417.78 speaker3  Hey.
416.78 426.38 speaker2  Hello. I am a time traveler.
424.22 438.30 speaker3  Oh goodness. So we're doing a new story set in the same universe. Like three weeks ago. Yeah.
437.30 449.72 speaker2  Yeah. Around there. And... And then we made them last night.
445.30 455.44 speaker3  When I told you guys to make characters, did you expect it to be in the same... What did I tell you? I told you to make High Schoolers. You told us pretty much exactly what's about to happen.
454.22 468.80 speaker2  High Schoolers in the Woods. It's a prequel. Oh yeah. Prequel. A while back you told us to prepare to make new characters, and I figured that our characters would die and we would just come in, you know.
467.20 475.40 speaker3  He figured our characters would die. But we fucked up those plans in a very fun way.
474.28 486.76 speaker2  I didn't expect to be... Here we are. Here we are.
481.34 511.44 speaker3  So for those listening, I have asked these boys to create High Schoolers to play a little game in the woods. That's where we're at for this one. Play with High Schoolers in the Woods. Take High School boys out for games in the woods. It's called orienteering. I run a course. Fully licensed and accredited.
510.44 515.76 speaker2  Walk on a rope. So much rope walking.
514.76 581.44 speaker3  Get ready. And just to give you guys, listeners, a parameter of what to expect here. The whole last arc with the characters that we played, we did a Pulp Cthulhu mashup. And on this one, we did not do that. So for their characteristics, what are they called, stats, for the strength and constitution and power and stuff, I gave them 60 points to put in, which would average out to 10 points on each stat there. Which means that they're weaker. They're the worst characters. Makes us a lot daintier. Exactly. And the hit points. Exactly. Out in the woods. It's just because I want to teach young men how to become better men.
580.44 596.28 speaker2  Exactly.
589.98 607.64 speaker3  And then for the skills, I gave them 400 points to put into the different skills, which is considerably less than even a Call of Cthulhu or Delta Green character.
604.88 609.64 speaker2  puts another layer of squishiness on us. Yeah.
608.64 623.60 speaker3  There's a bit of squish. We're just helpless little boys. What does Zach want to do to us out here? Torment, scare, kill.
622.60 644.92 speaker2  All right, we got it boys. We got them. We got them. I am a time traveler.
640.72 649.92 speaker3  Let's dive into the game. Damn it. Fuck.
647.92 650.92 speaker2  No, I just lost the game.
649.92 700.20 speaker3  Oh. Fuck. Yeah. We see a high school classroom and the round clock up on the wall, like all high school And on the whiteboard or chalkboard, regardless, is the word detention and sitting at the only desk that is occupied in the room is a boy, a helpless boy. Thomas, what does this boy look like?
692.56 720.62 speaker2  Like Judd Nelson in the Breakfast Club, but really young, like 13, 14. So what's he wearing? He's got kind of raggedy, like pretty thin Western shirt on Wranglers jeans and some
718.94 722.66 speaker3  What's he doing right now?
720.62 738.66 speaker2  Sitting alone in detention.
735.18 779.50 speaker3  Mr. Pettymore, you know that you're supposed to be doing your schoolwork. The teacher also rolls his eyes. The teacher is wearing a sweater vest and some slacks and kind of like an oversized shirt underneath the sweater vest that's poofing out from underneath it. And he's got horn rim glasses and he is equally scowling at you.
778.50 804.96 speaker2  or 14. So he wouldn't, shouldn't have one. It happens to be one that was bought for him by his dad and told that he needed to wear to visualize himself in the future. But he's tall and very fit and he's got a great head of hair and he walks in with a lot of, his head held high.
802.56 831.66 speaker3  And the teacher greets you very warmly. And Oh my God, look who it is, Ash. Oh, my two favorite students.
828.30 879.24 speaker2  jacket so the teacher can't see, but he gives them a like jack off motion. Like, okay. is five something. He's got a white t-shirt on with kind of like a, like a sleeveless jacket vest kind of thing that's buttoned up over his white t-shirt. And it's a mix between like cheetah print and horn, horns, what is it? Houndstooth. Uh, but it's like cheetah print colored acid wash jeans and some like, uh, kind of like scuffed up tennis shoes on. And he walks in and he just kind of winks at the teacher and he looks and he sits down at a desk.
874.98 885.90 speaker3  Ash, I am, I am positive that you don't have detention today. What are you boys doing in my classroom? We saw that, uh, our buddy Jeremy was in here.
883.98 888.90 speaker2  We thought we'd come keep him company. Get back to work. Sorry.
887.90 894.48 speaker3  You were saying?
893.10 915.74 speaker2  here with Jeremy. Just make sure you didn't feel alone down here. Ken and I have a group project that, well, my parents don't really want people, uh, to come over until they're at home and, uh, Ken's is too far to walk to. So, uh, we figured we just hang out here until, until, uh, we got done with our, our stuff.
910.50 933.34 speaker3  Well you know that here at Silas Cole K through 12, we don't necessarily appreciate people joining in on detentions when they don't quite have detention, might give off the wrong idea that it's something fun to do. But you know, you, you two are allowed to do whatever you want.
932.34 937.54 speaker2  Fuck. The only schoolwork I got is with these two.
935.34 965.66 speaker3  Sorry, sir. He is in our class with the, this, this group project.
963.82 966.66 speaker2  Jeremy, get back to work.
965.66 983.26 speaker3  Yes sir. And the, uh, the, the teacher leaves the room and closes the door behind him.
978.78 994.46 speaker2  Uh, and I knocked some stuff off his desk and I'm like, all right, let's get out of here losers. Oh, you just know what, what's that guy's name?
992.90 1001.58 speaker3  Uh, no relation.
999.86 1023.70 speaker2  You know, old Benji just hates me. He just has it out for me. Oh yeah. I open up my like little sweater jacket thing and lining the inside is just a bunch of like a water dynamite.
1022.70 1037.90 speaker3  What's water dynamite?
1036.22 1039.90 speaker2  Uh, yeah, no, sure. Of course.
1038.90 1056.54 speaker3  Are you nervous? What do you mean? You scared old man.
1050.58 1095.82 speaker2  woods and I got some, I got something that I wouldn't even bring to school, that home It's fireworks or maybe something more. me lately, but it is our last hurrah for this year. there.
1094.82 1107.78 speaker1  You know how they are.
1106.78 1115.16 speaker2  You're a fuck. Just like Mr. Krinklehoff.
1109.78 1125.58 speaker3  Cursing as he comes back into the room and Mr. Krinklehoff looks at the stuff that was on his desk that is now on the ground and he looks specifically at Jeremy Pettymore. You shouldn't have left the window open, man.
1123.34 1142.94 speaker2  Hey man, actually our school project, it's outside. We got to go out in them woods and gather some sticks and stuff. So I'll see you all around. It's for our biology class with, uh, and then Ash, Ash can't think of a biology teacher because he's not in biology this semester.
1140.22 1145.94 speaker1  Biology, Mr. Krinklehoff. That's what he was working on. You trust Ken, right?
1144.94 1153.58 speaker2  All right.
1152.58 1174.98 speaker3  The two. Okay. I'll look forward to it. Wait, no, tomorrow. Saturday. We have the, the big, uh, the big parade. Yeah. No, um, yeah. Monday. Okay. Yeah. Detention right here. Whole time. And you're going to work. Don't think you're not going to work. These two can't come in every single day and save you. I mean, Ken's got sport practice, you know, that's true on Mondays. That's when you do sport. I wouldn't miss it.
1173.98 1185.82 speaker2  You better not. You are the best at the whole, the whole team. Yeah. And in the school, perhaps even in the state, you're one of the best.
1184.82 1193.38 speaker1  never lost on me.
1190.02 1195.62 speaker2  Uh, once you're a senior bringing us to the game, the big game.
1193.38 1208.12 speaker1  My dad always says, I'm going to put the family on the map. The Krinklehoff name.
1205.70 1209.12 speaker3  to have our name shining in lights.
1208.12 1252.52 speaker2  That's right. That's right. Benji you married into the Krinklehoff family and took your wife's last name, right? Yeah. And this is the nineties. Just like you. Let's go boys.
1248.44 1264.72 speaker3  As you guys are walking down the hall, I think we've gotten a decent sense of who your characters are, but how do you walk down the high school hallway, each of you? I'm curious.
1261.64 1272.92 speaker1  ahead than it would be to look like I was with these people.
1268.12 1296.28 speaker2  just running it down the lockers to make like a clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, sound. I'm just on my smartphone. It is 1994, right? Doesn't matter. 25 years later, 25 years earlier.
1295.28 1325.76 speaker3  Time. I don't care for it. Yeah. That's why I decided to, on our very first podcast venture, run a role playing game based around time travel. Like a fucking idiot. Wait.
1324.76 1332.00 speaker0  up to tonight?
1330.60 1335.88 speaker3  I forgot that's your guys' thing, right? You guys go look for Madge or whatever?
1334.88 1339.88 speaker2  That's our thing. It's out of the three of us. That's our thing.
1338.88 1346.56 speaker1  That's our thing. We've done.
1341.64 1360.20 speaker2  It's kept us together over all the years we kind of became different people, kind of started hanging out with the little different groups, but it's the one thing that keeps us tied together like glue. I mean, that's always been the idea. I mean, that's the goal. We're going to find her.
1359.20 1372.72 speaker1  Yeah. Yeah.
1371.72 1375.72 speaker2  Hey man. We'll have fun doing that.
1374.72 1378.72 speaker3  Yeah. Don't tell anybody.
1377.72 1404.16 speaker2  That's not cool, man. Yeah, sure. There we go. Brother, uh, as I said, if I ran into you to tell you that he's out and, uh, to get ahold of him.
1403.16 1417.80 speaker3  I could use some. Oh, do you guys want, how should I, am I supposed to sell weed to freshmen?
1413.88 1419.80 speaker1  He's kind of like turned around and just maybe like kicking the locker across the hall.
1418.80 1434.32 speaker2  Ash, Ash. It's true. We gotta, we gotta be. Okay. Well, Cleve Moore, we gotta, we gotta get on our way. I'll see you later. Yes. All right.
1433.32 1440.84 speaker3  Goodbye, Eduardo. You know, I prefer it when you call me Eduardo.
1438.88 1444.48 speaker2  I just like to call people by their last names sometimes.
1441.84 1448.48 speaker3  Well, it's rude, but I like you anyway. Okay.
1447.48 1457.56 speaker2  That guy's exhausting. It's like talking to a fucking turtle. It's like talking to Eeyore. I would, I don't know.
1453.64 1468.72 speaker3  That guy gets high every day and I personally as Jeremy Pettimore can not relate to that.
1467.72 1476.12 speaker2  Ken, skip with us. What is the contention high school mascot? Ooh, uh, the octopi. Did we ever, was it, is that cannon? I think it's something weird.
1474.60 1489.60 speaker1  I doubt you said it. Octopus isn't bad.
1488.60 1491.60 speaker3  We know how much Zach likes that. The 40 miners.
1490.60 1498.18 speaker2  Stop making that joke.
1493.60 1515.88 speaker3  I didn't even get it because that's not how my mind works. That's exactly right. All right.
1514.88 1529.08 speaker2  Yeah. On the way out, the mascot is a guy with one of those hard hats on with the light and he's got the pickaxe in one hand and he's holding out his other and I jump up and I smack his hand to give him a high five.
1526.20 1545.80 speaker3  Except it's a huge, like it's a giant mascot head. Yeah. That's very fun.
1544.80 1582.44 speaker2  Yeah. I jump up and give him a little high five for good luck for the team, for Ken and for tonight. That's fun. H O R N B E A M. Horn beam.
1580.04 1597.88 speaker3  And Thomas, your character is Jeremy Pettymore. I believe we already know how to spell that. A lot of people don't. It's not with a Y. It's with an I. Ash, you mentioned that you have a car for the evening, I believe.
1595.88 1620.56 speaker2  It's my older brother's car. Very cool.
1616.36 1631.56 speaker3  you're driving in this 91 Firebird. It's like a country road probably, yeah.
1630.56 1645.78 speaker2  Okay. I'm going the speed. I'm going like probably 10 over till we get to the dirt road and then just pedal to the metal. All right.
1639.80 1655.44 speaker3  So as soon as you turn on the dirt road to the contention woods, you put the pedal to the metal.
1651.80 1660.58 speaker2  I reach over and turn the tape deck up and Copperhead Road is blessed.
1657.96 1664.56 speaker3  Go ahead and roll a drive check for me.
1663.44 1673.44 speaker2  And then I look at him and laugh. I'm like, it's my brother's car.
1671.64 1678.40 speaker3  in your wheels path. I rolled a 44 on a 50.
1676.48 1688.56 speaker2  Oh, okay.
1682.40 1698.68 speaker3  And you are very good at fishtailing and whipping the back end of this Firebird around. And as soon as you see it, you...
1693.62 1714.24 speaker2  So I kind of turn the wheel to where the car kind of like goes sideways on the road, goes underneath the car. I like start driving backwards and flip it around and basically do a 360 and keep going
1706.72 1799.76 speaker3  The squirrel looks at you with these massive cartoonish eyes before it dips off into the woods. You know, it works. Ash Hornbeam. Bean, I keep fucking this up. Hornbeam. Hornbeam. I want to say bean. Yeah, exactly. Yes. So you guys pull into this parking lot, it's a gravel parking lot for the contention woods. And there are two cars in the parking lot currently, one of which has a notice that is taped up on the driver's side window and the other has a boot on the back left wheel. And you guys see that there is a little shack at the entrance, which you know is typically unoccupied and it is like the entrance to the woods. So it's where the trailhead is. Is it like a park ranger shack thing?
1798.76 1814.24 speaker2  Exactly.
1808.60 1826.40 speaker3  like a Bronco, let's go with a Ford Bronco, that has got a lift kit on it.
1819.14 1840.74 speaker2  a little piece of paper, write, please don't boot my car, ash horn beam, and put it underneath the windshield wiper. You said like a Bronco though? Yeah. Is there any notice or boot on that? No. So fresh. Does it look like the ranger's car? It does.
1839.74 1851.34 speaker3  Okay.
1850.34 1858.80 speaker2  cars are unlocked. Absolutely.
1853.64 1926.66 speaker3  You guys were extremely mature police officers, so I'm sure making you a freshman in high school won't- Seems like it might be visible. out perhaps previously by someone else. It's so clean inside that it looks like someone came in and took everything out of it already. That's kind of weird. That is kind of weird. And the other one you find a bunch of camping equipment, and there is in the console a title for the vehicle that belongs to one Stuart Feldman. Do we know who that is?
1924.38 1940.34 speaker2  Is it registered in contention, or somewhere else? We can return it later.
1937.90 1942.34 speaker3  It's the one with the notice on it. What do you think?
1941.34 1950.22 speaker2  We can always just bring it back. Yeah, I mean, yeah. I like that idea.
1946.72 1966.70 speaker3  You find liquor and a pistol with ammunition.
1962.94 1989.30 speaker2  stick of dynamite at my grandpa's house, so I brought that with me. I don't want to touch the gun. Sure. Can I peek into the shack to see if the ranger's in there?
1982.30 2006.58 speaker3  Yeah, and as you walk up to it and peek in, you do see there is an elderly man sitting on a stool. It's got one of those open-air windows that he would greet you from, basically, and he was asleep until you walked up. Fuck. And this is the ranger? This is the ranger, but as soon as you poke your head in-
2003.78 2033.78 speaker2  He's got a sweet fucking ride for such an old man. I know. He kind of-
2028.42 2044.26 speaker3  and you see that he's actually wearing a uniform that is issued by the state, and he says,
2042.66 2045.26 speaker2  Wait, didn't you just say his name was Jeb?
2044.26 2050.86 speaker3  No, you did.
2049.86 2053.58 speaker2  I think you did.
2051.86 2063.46 speaker3  You're just so good at improv that you just- And looking around, you see that he's got a cane.
2062.02 2071.46 speaker2  You've misread the situation, sir. No, but-
2065.14 2125.06 speaker3  I've already written down this man's name, and he's got a cane next to him, and you would see looking around the little shack, there are clipboards all hanging on the wall and at this desk, and there are fire extinguishers, axes, machetes, flashlights, hand sanitizer, and a first aid kit, and a bunch of other stuff like that. And you do see there is a board behind him with pictures and pieces of paper thumbtacked into the board, like a bulletin board kind of thing, and he says, I'm going to need to around here in contention, so we just need to make sure that we have all of the information
2121.30 2134.94 speaker2  Did you ever consider that a goo monster was taking them to the past? Not even a little bit, son. Are you high right now? No, I was just fucking around with you. Hey, what happened to Jeb, the normal guy?
2130.90 2176.54 speaker3  Well, and he points back at the board, and there's a picture of Jeb. It's a Polaroid, and there's a piece of paper behind each Polaroid, and he says, we're going to need to take a couple pictures of you both and get some information as well, son, what's your name? Okay.
2171.58 2186.50 speaker2  Just a keen sense of imagination and wonder and hope for the world and the future, despite the circumstances I come from personally in my broken home, I still got a lot, I think, to live for.
2185.50 2240.30 speaker3  I like that. I like you. And he writes all that information down, and then he looks up and he says, one last question. If you were to be scared and run away in some place, where might we find you if you were hiding? Probably the old caves. Probably the old caves indeed. And then he looks over at Ash and he says, oh, I like the jib of your cut, and he takes a picture of you. You might be the most photogenic person in contention. He says, what's your name there, sonny? Hornbeam. Ash Hornbeam. Ash, Hornbeam. And what are you up to tonight in the woods?
2235.22 2246.94 speaker2  to come down later, but me and this guy and another buddy, every year we come down here and we, you know, just boys' night in the woods. Yes, sir.
2245.90 2258.54 speaker3  Four years running. You must be very close friends. Oh, yeah. The closest. And did you bring anything with you this evening, Mr. Hornbeam?
2255.98 2274.18 speaker2  That is not traditional camping equipment. Just the tent and this sleeping bag. But I see there's a first aid kit in there. Could we borrow that?
2272.58 2304.78 speaker3  They come here looking for it. It's like if your kid goes missing in the grocery store, you don't want them to go looking about for you. You want them to stay as close to you as possible. I remember one time my grandchild Poppy, he went missing in the grocery store and we never found him. You have a funny sensibility about you and I enjoy it thoroughly.
2299.54 2338.94 speaker2  Well, sometimes your first aid kit grows up and you just got to let it go on its own. Sometimes our normal campsite's a little overgrown. What about maybe, could we have one of those machetes to maybe cut down brush and whatnot? That's a fail.
2336.70 2344.30 speaker3  that grows too quick around here. You know what I mean? I know what you mean.
2340.94 2346.30 speaker2  Unlike the first aid kit, you're going to keep it because you're not entirely bad at your job.
2345.30 2353.70 speaker3  Exactly.
2352.34 2361.46 speaker2  if that were to happen. guy with his head ripped off or something.
2360.46 2387.78 speaker3  I doubt it. My mom always said that if my head wasn't attached to my shoulders, I wouldn't be alive.
2383.94 2405.54 speaker2  And as he does, I want to kind of like sneak around and try to maybe steal some of that fling it out past to create a distraction.
2403.78 2406.54 speaker3  Can I roll pranks for mine?
2405.54 2408.54 speaker2  Okay.
2407.54 2433.72 speaker3  Yeah. Dude, yes. Yeah. And you can craft pranks. Okay. Thomas a boost to his stealth roll.
2430.68 2464.80 speaker2  I would also like to use criminology instead of stealth. You absolutely can. but the uncles that I've been fostered out to occasionally are all quite criminal and they're the only people I have to look up to. All right. So I've kind of thing or two. That would, that takes me up to a 70 and I roll a four. Congratulations.
2463.12 2483.52 speaker3  A lot of clipboards. We've got the bulletin board with the pictures and the information. We've got fire extinguishers, axes, machetes, flashlights, hand sanitizer, and a first aid kit that is already in Ash's hands.
2482.52 2498.26 speaker2  I sleep in it. Does he leave? Does he go check out the relatively big pop in the sky behind the shack?
2497.26 2510.58 speaker3  Yeah.
2504.02 2519.74 speaker2  out of the view of the little window and like fired up probably 20 feet past the shack. So he has to leave to go check it out.
2515.38 2545.20 speaker3  And you hear it and he's like, Oh, Oh no. I, I, Oh, I'm going to be right back boys. I need to take care of something. And he stands up and uses his cane to walk out of this little shack and he heads over to the restrooms that are attached to the shack.
2539.66 2563.26 speaker2  you just see like machetes and the fire extinguisher and flashlights all just like being cartoonishly tossed out to Keith. Perfect. Keith. Uh, ash. Ash. Ash. That's going to be fun. So did we pretty much get everything? Maybe one fire extinguisher just in case two of everything.
2558.58 2567.18 speaker3  Two machetes, two axes, a fire extinguisher, three flashlights if we can get them. Yeah, for sure.
2564.26 2579.98 speaker2  Uh, and then hand sanitizer, hand sanitizer.
2574.74 2604.30 speaker3  We recognize many of them because this is an extremely small town and you would know that a lot of people have been going missing over the past month and the contention police force is seemingly doing very little about it. They're not even really talking about it.
2599.10 2607.22 speaker2  for six months and you know, lives a sinful liberal life.
2606.22 2611.06 speaker3  Learns about the world.
2610.06 2619.38 speaker2  Holy shit. Is there anybody I don't recognize or anybody who really stands out?
2613.58 2651.14 speaker3  Yeah, there is a, there's one guy who is named Stuart. What did I call that guy? Stuart Feldman is a bald guy with an extremely thick jaw line and he seems to be upper middle aged but in incredible shape and looking at his information, he said that he was out in the woods on business and he is a Brit. It is noted.
2647.50 2680.46 speaker2  This is kind of, this is kind of weird here, Ash, right here looking for madge. I think we might've stumbled on some, some kind of a young adult coming of age bonding mystery. I agree. What's a, what's a British guy doing in contention? I don't even know what that is. I that's because you are always in detention and not doing your homework. Hey, you know, but Hey, I didn't know enough about geography than I can point it out on a map.
2678.90 2684.34 speaker1  Here's a globe sitting on his desk.
2681.76 2697.86 speaker2  And I point to Ireland. If you were playing Keith, that would have been like an absolute win.
2696.66 2715.46 speaker3  Do I see those in here anywhere? Uh, roll another search check for me there. You see the keys to the Bronco and they are attached to the keys for this shack seemingly.
2714.46 2744.70 speaker2  Nope. Okay. I'm a little, uh, kind of like nervous, but I don't say anything about it. Hey, come on man.
2739.26 2748.86 speaker3  If you were to go missing and running off somewhere, where would you be hiding? Ash?
2747.54 2755.26 speaker2  So I assumed the caves. Yeah. I mean, that's where we, that's where he said he'd be.
2754.26 2766.02 speaker3  All right. And I'm not too familiar with these caves, but they are, where are they?
2765.02 2781.94 speaker2  on the globe. I point to contention. I'm like, they're right here. Okay. All right.
2776.66 2809.48 speaker3  He writes it all down and then he sticks your guys's pictures up on the board along with the information behind them. And he says, all right there. If you find any one of these people and he like points at all the people whose pictures
2807.28 2826.24 speaker2  So we might have a reference.
2825.24 2845.92 speaker1  Is that Stu? I think so.
2840.76 2908.04 speaker2  Is it like a drivable trail down to there or is it walking on like, it's so we know the car here. Right. What do you think Jeremy? Oh yeah. We already stole all this shit. We don't want to like attract more attention by just driving over the, the parking barrier. My brother would kill me if we fucked up his beautiful car. I know. But uh, well he lets me borrow his car, so yeah, he's pretty cool. For now. liquor flask. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. I flashed the flask at him. It's a massive flask. Oh, I look at him and I look at him and I kind of smile and I'm like, well, and out of my back pocket, I pull out a great mad dog 2020 and I'm like, I'm like, we're prepared.
2907.04 2934.44 speaker3  I think so. I think it is. the two of you?
2933.44 2969.56 speaker2  Fuck. I thought we were still playing shit back and I was like, I've never heard this at all. Legit. He repeated the same words for the start of it and I was like, okay, we're listening back. Shit. Okay. That was spooky.
2968.56 3002.72 speaker3  19. Congratulations. It looks like a car, some sort of vehicle and a smaller vehicle like a four wheeler have both driven down this trail.
2997.36 3033.12 speaker2  Looks like both a car or some kind of large vehicle and a four wheeler both driven down here recently. When I look down, I'm like, oh yeah, I see it too. Damn, we should have driven down here in my brother's car. We're pretty far down the trail anyway. He probably won't be giving us any trouble tonight then. Or come to our aid in case of emergency. Good thing we got that first aid kit. Yes and hand sanitizer.
3032.12 3067.28 speaker3  How do you set up camp? Normally the contention woods, each camping spot has enough wood for a fire waiting for people to come start a fire. And you got a fire pit, but there's no wood.
3061.08 3118.00 speaker2  Okay, well I go and start chopping at this log that's 20 feet away from the campsite. I know how to lat fire us, I don't know how to create them. I think it's kind of weird that there's no wood here, especially like Jeremy called ahead. He like made this reservation weeks ago for this spot. Make sure he has some wood for us. I think it's pretty weird. I'm a little frustrated, but I also want to look around. I want to do a little search of the area to see what else is different. I do not succeed.
3109.92 3148.88 speaker3  So you go looking around in the woods in the area and everything seems to be about normal. All right.
3143.28 3177.28 speaker2  So I'm chopping at this log and it's just usually the wood is like real nicely chopped and easy to make fires out of. I just have like some just misshapen giant pieces of wood that, you know, will eventually start a fire. But I've never done this before.
3167.04 3191.80 speaker3  As you're sitting there, you hear a rustling and then you see a man's head pops up from behind one of the bushes, alert ears, looks left, looks right, looks, makes dead eye contact with you and pops back down under the bush.
3190.80 3192.80 speaker2  Are your knees weak? Are your arms heavy? Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
