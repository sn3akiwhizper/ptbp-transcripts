0.00 143.68 speaker0  What's good, my little buttercups? It's your cow grease producer wolf, the dog. And I'm here to deliver all the full fat milk to all my hungry little babies who can then shake that cream around until it turns solid. That's how the butter is made. Or so I'm told, I am coagulating live from 694.2 PTBP, the only radio station that artisanally crafts its own butter for its host to eat. Speaking of cream, grease, and being told stuff, we got ourselves a new Howlin' with Wolf. who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod, which is the quickest way to make a notification appear in the notifications tab, of the app pretending pod Twitter account. They write, I just want to thank the beautiful bastards who make one of the best podcasts out there. You guys are killing it, may all your balls be smooth. Well damn, thank you Wes from PA. smoothness over the feel of beautiful bristles. What's wrong with petting something that got the feel of a wire-haired brush dipped in a vat of Vaseline? Remember, if you want to write up something for your milk-producing wolf to howl, tag that pretending pod on the internet. like bum-fuzzle, accubation, clique, and click right down there on those show notes to find links to all of my videos. You know you want to make me say some silly shit, like bum-fuzzle, accubation, clique, and click right down there on those show notes to find links to all our ramshackle internet gobbledygook. Goggle with hogwash and swallow lickety-split, it's time for the news. Ahem, I, Wolf the dog, do hereby relinquish my duty to read the news for this episode, and that this will be done by an old friend,
140.56 160.08 speaker1  We met in college where we all studied talking at people real good. I got my damn MFA even, so technically I could be Professor Wolfie,
155.48 212.96 speaker0  specifically the people whose minds are easily penetrated by my all-powerful aura. For one, cannot simply take over the world by just teaching. You must be able to control them with the most modern communication vessel of the century, the most cutting-edge technology, FM radio babies. Also, the community college I applied to never got back to me about the job. Now, slop yourself up enough rubber-boo to feel the collywobbles and fight the whamble.
208.76 341.80 speaker2  Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline Leaving my mind at your altar Crossing the double line, doing it every time Tell me what kind of world are you living in? What kind of world are you living in? Whoa, hello, hello, everybody, Nick Nichols, is this not the, I'm Nick Nichols and this is Nick Nichols. just makes you giggle like that. When your cheeks get rosy, my heart gets fozy, and that's a word that I mispronounce, like fuzzy is fozy, and you love it, I love it, we're all here. And I love you too, my elder brother. We were both born right before the other one. Well, I've just been watching this cool, is it a fight, is it a battle, is it a war, is it, what is it exactly that we're watching here? I'm not too sure, but it is darn entertaining. And it's darn entertaining for sure, and I do think that part of it might determine the outcome of our futures, whether it be us in our lives or the future of humanity, all right, all right, all right. Are you saying that there might be different realities, Nick? I'm just saying we were hugged Can you say that again for the folks at home?
339.28 349.88 speaker3  Well, let's get back to the moment at hand.
345.76 358.88 speaker2  or other planes of existence, different realities. Is that true? That's just a little theory of mind
353.88 367.04 speaker3  And I like to dabble in metaphysical theories in my off. Oh, did we lose Luke? Ignore him. Okay. I'm still here. I don't know what happened to my camera. I got scared.
365.00 376.12 speaker1  He switched positions to it frightened me. I'm back.
374.44 385.56 speaker3  Not even a little bit.
383.24 422.52 speaker2  a quick recap of last time here. Last time, that big fucker on the left, this thing that I've heard a few people on the ground call the giant dumber up in the case it reached up and touched the sky, turned the sky up into an ocean. Ocean with black starts swirling all around like a dark lake or a lake or something up there that you might look into. And then, blah, and then juggernauts shot and rose M-A-R-Y and cut that thing in half with its laser eyes. Oh, God, a bunch of other stuff happened. Don was in the room up there that we can't see, but we know what's going on. Yeah, we know, we know. Isn't that right, The Giggles?
421.52 424.52 speaker3  Yeah, we know what's going on.
422.52 505.80 speaker2  He's watching Keith talk through the phone. And then these creatures, these tall skeletal creatures that kind of look like Bobby Glass showed up. Now we're down to one, and its hand is all shrunk down weird because this old version of the Clark Bishop sees through it. A bunch of them popped like some sort of zits. Oh, God. That's right, The Giggles, like some sort of zit. blasted a wide bar of them down the road, down to one, and out, and out, and out, and out, and Dawn came running outside, Dawn D. Pennymore. We got John Ball, Ball version of John D. Pennymore, lunged at M-A-R-Y, and her top half is the body of the Rosemary, cut in half, starts shuffling all back. John Ball plunged up into the gut, and then Keith Ligna with his frozen peashooter comes down and freezes her bottom half and then smashes off the bottom half. It's going, it's going, man.
504.04 516.64 speaker1  Clark Bishop tried to pull out his gun,
513.04 567.30 speaker2  fired his gun in the air, hit one of these new sea creatures that was pretty much in the air. And then John Ball comes down and blows his own head off, and then Blana Juggernaut comes down, boom, lands all next to Keith's jaw, and then these new sea creatures that was pouring out of the sky, the sky that is slowly rising from its own plane of gravity, which means that it's lowering slowly towards us. in a few rounds by this water with these crazy little worm guys coming out the top. and they are purple, brown, and black. It is getting goopy up in here.
564.22 573.34 speaker3  He's like, I haven't thought about the words I'm saying.
570.14 586.34 speaker2  is that when John leave Will Fortune more, shot his gun into the sky and hit one of those worm things,
583.98 590.94 speaker3  to physical bullets and such. Well, that'd be something to keep in mind moving forward.
588.50 632.10 speaker2  And we got M-A-R-Y. This thing plugged in one of its metal sigils into the ground, seemingly starting to form some sort of portal. Over there in the pitch-blark room, being pitch-blark-roofed, Keith thinks to ask Muriad on a phone to get rid of the big thing out there and bring two McFlurries, one Oreo, one M&M. That is about Wayne Clark. This is the older version of Clark, the overseer told him, shriveled the last Muriad hand back to its elbow and tailored its suit so we can all see the results there. And then Clark Bishop seems to have some sort of conversation happening with this last little
629.40 650.28 speaker3  long-gone translucent beast, and there's so many of them. You have your own to choose, one without a head, the old creepy one, and that one, the good one, I think.
649.44 665.60 speaker1  Who can say?
662.44 697.84 speaker2  He is shooting his frozen gun right up into one of these worm's mouths. The mouth, I have turned green now, you see him with the mouth inside of mine. The mouth is completely frozen, and Keith Vigna dived in, feet first, What is happening?
696.56 698.88 speaker3  I don't think he is.
697.84 713.16 speaker1  Oh no.
710.84 728.00 speaker2  into that worm up there. John Ball went and tried to merge with him, A-R-Y, was repelled like a magnet, and then Wheel of Fort John here, we're finally at the end of things, Nick Nickles, so calm down, you are like, calm down, hey,
726.64 742.24 speaker3  Do not tell me to calm down, and I am simply pissing my pants in excitement. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
740.40 748.72 speaker2  they're waving around, they're discussing the reality in nature, much like we are now, reality.
747.32 757.80 speaker3  as far as we know.
754.60 771.44 speaker2  patted Don on the shoulder to reassure him.
770.24 783.60 speaker3  Yeah, could you do that again? Yeah, please do it again.
781.88 802.52 speaker2  and with me today is Nick Nickles. Let's give a quick recap of what happened last time.
800.28 813.92 speaker3  but, you know, give the people what they want. Now hear me out.
808.92 822.20 speaker1  Oh, this huge lumbering beast that is just towering
817.32 858.88 speaker2  story upon story upon story above you all. It's limbs forming and reforming, shaping and reshaping in a way to where you can't exactly tell it's the, oh no, it's there, it's not there. It is both in this world of this world and nowhere at all.
856.60 861.88 speaker3  it just completely cuts out on this chord
858.88 872.72 speaker1  from the noise gate filters. We get the perfect faces for it. except for occasional like, and then, yeah.
871.56 882.92 speaker3  And then when the episode comes out, we get to hear what you wanted us to hear. It's not even eight in the morning.
882.08 906.72 speaker1  Oh God.
904.92 937.36 speaker2  is about to come. had just reached up into the sky, turned the entirety of the sky into a swirling ocean with waves coming across it. And then these like massive worms started poking their heads out of it.
935.12 1047.64 speaker1  from its point of view, which means that it is lowering slowly down onto you. that are now the size of skyscrapers themselves. I mean, we're talking tens of stories tall at this point. It bends over and it erupts. Something from deep within it begins making this horrible noise. And it's almost as if you hear the souls of every single person that it has ever engulfed cry out as its mouth opens and you see a bevy of skeletons begin to fall out of its mouth. They are all dripping with this same black residue, this puke, this resipuke that is just covering each of these skeletons. And they're all being held by their backs as they're free falling by like a bungee rope, like a marionette doll, like they're marionette dolls, but what the strings holding them are the same strings of like thick, mucusy residue. And these things are crying out in pain, They're real grabby with their hands and their arms and their legs.
1046.44 1069.92 speaker3  Let's go ahead and roll. of skeleton souls, not a horde. That is correct, that is correct.
1064.92 1077.48 speaker1  It is a highly trained para skeletal team.
1074.44 1083.04 speaker3  or whatever that has like the little light on its head. Is it kind of like that, but with skeletons?
1082.20 1088.60 speaker1  I don't think so. It's not like that. But I was just saying, yeah, that's a fish.
1085.88 1102.88 speaker3  It's more like these skeletons make a giant frog's tongue that's coming out and getting ready to come out and like grab a fly. Yeah, there's 12 frogs tongues. Gotcha, okay, that makes more sense. And on the tip of each tongue is a fun little skeleton doing a little dance as it comes toward you.
1101.84 1187.48 speaker1  Yeah. which is currently half embodying. and it's been using her mouth like a weird puppet as it's been dragging her body backwards It's got one of its other metal tendrils plugged into the luminous land below and to the left of you all and is forming a sort of swirl of technicolor light that is emitting now from the ground. You've seen this before and you know that she is creating or it is creating a portal. M-A-R-Y is going to roll a dodge because she is going to try to keep this portal going for this entire round. And so she's gonna roll a dodge at a negative 20 to contest any rolls against her to try to stop this attempt at a portal opening. And she has succeeded with a roll that I will keep to myself. She had a negative 20. Yeah, she was at a negative 20 and she still passed Beatable. If you say it three times, you'll beat it.
1186.04 1193.08 speaker3  Beatable.
1190.56 1197.24 speaker1  Carry on, it is Keith Vigna's turn.
1196.20 1203.08 speaker3  What happened last time?
1201.68 1208.16 speaker2  Let's die for you.
1205.60 1215.84 speaker1  Sorry, it's Keith Beams' turn.
1213.20 1219.12 speaker3  Is Don in the room with me still or did he leave?
1217.72 1226.80 speaker1  You called out to him last time and asked what kind of McFlurry he wanted. He did not respond and so you assumed him in it.
1224.04 1247.32 speaker3  Okay, yeah, so as Keith is, he's laying down on the ground and then he remembers. He's like, oh yeah, I just asked for a McFlurry. I guess I better go out and meet him.
1244.76 1273.56 speaker1  All right, so I've got a mini game here. It's gonna take about three episodes to play of you getting out of this room. So Justin, you're gonna be Keith Beams' left leg. Joe, you're gonna be Keith Beams' left hand. Thomas, you're gonna be the left foot. And then Luke, you're gonna be Keith Beams' nose. So if you could each roll a D7 and then add negative I.
1272.28 1275.08 speaker3  D7, right, got it.
1273.56 1303.26 speaker1  Yeah, I'm at six I. Oh, perfect. So you kind of feel your way with your, well, you bump into the side of the room with your nose but only half of your nose gets bumped and you're like, oh, perfect, I'm right at the doorway. And you reach out with Thomas and Justin's left hand and feel around the corner and you kind of feel the stairwell of this enormous room. The enormous room, you feel the stairwell leading down from this towering building.
1299.68 1306.16 speaker3  Is there still no light or is there light in the hallway?
1304.92 1314.22 speaker1  from the bottom of the stairwell and so you make your way down the stairs and out of this towering dark building and you see.
1311.68 1335.58 speaker3  Okay, so if he's making his way out, then we'll start with me, left foot. That's right, yes, go ahead and roll. Let's see how that first step goes. and anyway. Please tell me you rolled well.
1333.82 1341.06 speaker1  in the dumbest thing I've ever said.
1338.82 1356.82 speaker3  This is, you think the dumbest thing you've ever said? All right, since Keith's left foot failed the foot roll, I stumble down the stairs, just head over, rolling down the stairs.
1354.58 1363.46 speaker2  Rolling, rolling.
1359.22 1451.74 speaker1  Nice, Keith Beans rolls head over butt down the stairs and you land at the bottom of this. Ouchie, ouchie. and you land ace first down at the bottom of these stairs of the base of this towering tower, this dark building that was first shown in a Polaroid picture from Julie Maxwell's car way back in episode one. And so you look out onto this battlefield ahead of you and you see just pure fucking nonsense. The alarms start blaring and these creatures begin falling from the sky and hitting the ground with a thud, but they don't seem to be affected by falling from however far they fell. They're tall, gaunt, translucent, wearing black suits and looking out onto this battlefield, darkness surrounding you, light completely illuminating the land. These same creatures are falling from the sky.
1446.98 1461.06 speaker3  and Keith just kind of breaks down a little bit and he just starts crying, but it's like an angry cry.
1459.30 1466.02 speaker2  What do you think about that?
1463.58 1472.22 speaker3  but we're powering through, buddy, am I right?
1470.86 1478.90 speaker1  on either side of Keith Vigna. Just holding microphones down on his face.
1476.94 1498.38 speaker3  Look at Nick and Mick Nichols with both of their microphones held at my face and I'm crying. I've just yelled, I don't deserve to live. I've been thinking about all the atrocities that I've committed throughout my lifetimes
1496.66 1549.02 speaker1  It's the overseer's turn. in that last round, wherein you literally beamed out this same light from your face that you saw him do first and in that moment, something in your consciousness flickered and there's something strange about it. It's like Clark Bishop is still controlling Clark Bishop and the overseer is still the overseer, but you, Joe Terry, author of your own story, have now taken control. Through becoming the overseer, you have become the overseer.
1547.50 1554.26 speaker3  Yeah. Yeah, okay.
1550.10 1585.24 speaker1  You are floating about 10 feet above the luminous land liturgy that is weaving in and out of itself in a circle, chanting, I did it for the alliteration. because I don't know what it means. Oh, what a liturgy is?
1583.68 1593.04 speaker3  It's just like the service. It's the body and texts and songs of the service, I'm pretty sure.
1590.52 1638.80 speaker1  Yeah, a form or formulary according to which public religious worship, especially Christian worship, is conducted. It's the ritual, the service, the ceremony. bobbing and weaving in and around in a circle around you. And it's just liturgying all over your liturgy. And you feel the liturgy within your liturgy. And you feel this immense power that is being given to you, granted to you by this song, by this chant. And it is flowing within you and giving you what you think is an unnatural score of at least 85.
1636.96 1641.92 speaker3  Now I'm going to put down 85.
1640.28 1659.96 speaker1  That's what you said and I said sick after it We just say sick and then it's not only seconded, not only voted on, it's finished.
1657.80 1747.12 speaker3  I have a righteous, the motion carries. But I am going to shit my pants. Oh no, he's showing it to us now. What the fuck is wrong with him? Oh, he's wiping it on his face and on the walls now, what? Guy's holding up a newspaper but it's from 10 years ago. What is he telling us? Oh, Sirhan Sirhan should get probation?
1744.86 1750.36 speaker1  all of his mess that he made on the floor. Yeah, that was disgusting.
1748.40 1752.84 speaker3  I don't understand what just happened.
1750.36 1757.92 speaker1  Thomas, what was the point of the newspaper?
1755.32 1802.40 speaker3  but if you don't get it, I mean, Right. That's right. My glorious war paint and... That's not subtly that moment. Well, now the coolest thing we've done is one of the hosts smeared shit all over his face in this guy's mind right now.
1799.66 1810.24 speaker1  And to give Joe a good amount of time
1809.40 1875.54 speaker3  Oh! Yeah, it would have been. Oh, you made me laugh now that my reality is shifting and I'm getting some insight into the overseer's head, can I dig around in there a little bit and see what I know? Hondo P, baby. Oh, what are you looking for? And my goal, since I now have a Clark Gold, I have an overseer, and I've also got a Clark who has just recently proven that he can handle some level of skill. I wanna see if there are extra spells rattling around in overseer's head that he can pass along to me Clark, Clark Current. Clark me. And divide forces. If me Clark needs to go be working on something while overseer's working on something else, and he needs to delegate. He's obviously had an end goal in mind. Let's make that happen.
1872.90 1899.78 speaker1  because the same time you feel all of this power, you feel an immense amount of fear, and it is all directed at this creature. whatever you want to impart onto this younger version of yourself, you feel good about being able to do that.
1896.72 1912.40 speaker3  I wanted to make sure that he has a chance to right now with this moment of noticing, oh shit, my Clark, my younger Clark is capable. I wanna use this time to tell him what he needs to do.
1910.98 1933.94 speaker1  you just had this conversation with the only tall, gaunt creature last time, and you both agreed the Lumbering Beast was the issue, you would assume to help. You can think about the abilities that they've used, right? So.
1932.78 1941.46 speaker3  Yep, and wipe a mind.
1938.42 1951.54 speaker1  then you guys can probably eliminate it. are coming down, and those need to be addressed this round.
1949.94 1961.26 speaker3  Okay, this round, I don't know. I was gonna say, my thought was, with the paralyzing power of those, of our Marvin creatures,
1958.38 1965.56 speaker1  that they could stop those skeletons in their tracks.
1963.06 1999.94 speaker3  that he needs people around him to keep this power level up, so he wants to make sure that those skeletons can't take any more people. So maybe that's what this Overseer is going to focus on, is those skeletons. No, he doesn't. Holy shit. It's a 93. I rolled a 93.
1996.66 2033.38 speaker1  and seen the Overseer reach out, attempt something against these falling, lost bones, these rattling bones that are just dripping with ooze as they're falling down toward you, It's Clark Bishop's turn.
2028.38 2038.34 speaker3  and he feels what the Overseer was trying to do, and so he's gonna try it himself. He's gonna take up the mantle of,
2037.18 2046.14 speaker0  all right, I see what you were doing. I see what you were doing.
2041.14 2069.06 speaker3  That is a 20 on a 63 is what this Clark's Unnatural is. from the Overseer and just tweak it. He saw where he messed up. It was right there, and he just tweaks the thing in his mind, and that's the, oh shit, that's where the Overseer fucked up. Here we go, click.
2068.06 2082.14 speaker1  Roll sanity. As you analyze the Unnatural nature of the universe
2080.82 2087.82 speaker3  Do not pass. It's a 82 on a five.
2085.58 2132.62 speaker1  Lose one sanity. You know what that does, boy. Yeah, that's a breaking point. as you handle this situation, and handle it you do, because the losing of the sanity is knowing that you are fucking in control now. Dope. and holler what you roll.
2131.22 2144.58 speaker3  A 75. And a 12.
2142.34 2148.98 speaker1  for picking at one's skin. Nasty.
2147.26 2161.74 speaker3  now that he's like split his body.
2159.64 2163.46 speaker1  to repeat certain words.
2161.74 2168.94 speaker3  Ooh, that's interesting. Now that I'm casting spells. Yep.
2166.98 2188.76 speaker1  And 12. 12 is aminomania irrational cheerfulness.
2186.90 2202.26 speaker3  I can role play that one real easy. I kind of want to do that. I kind of think it'd be funny for him to be the most optimistic person in this total hellscape of a grim scenario. Yeah, let's do it. Let's do that one.
2201.30 2222.02 speaker1  Aminomania. That's perfect. frog into the frog tongue skeletons?
2219.74 2244.22 speaker3  I know that the overseer was last seen. You said he extended his hand. So I think Clark's starting with that. He's got a big smile on his face because he's figured it out. He knows what's going on and it's all going to be fine. And he does it. I don't know. Did you picture some of these powers? How strong is this? Can they start shattering
2242.66 2253.62 speaker1  You can do whatever you want. There's dripping skeletons that are coming down.
2250.02 2270.66 speaker3  He wants them to pop as though those couple of myriads he did, but these are bones. So he knows that this is more of a break and less of a pop, but he wants them to shatter and crumble. Okay.
2267.06 2279.54 speaker1  to see how many of these guys you can get. Uh-oh.
2278.58 2294.90 speaker3  I shit you not. Let's just pretend if we were rolling three, it would have been a 10. So.
2293.82 2298.64 speaker2  God damn it.
2295.80 2315.18 speaker3  This was young Clark who shot the spell off. That's why it was only three. Figuring out his powers.
2312.26 2338.02 speaker1  and their bones as they turn into dust kind of meld with the residue that's around them. And it turns into like residue mud. It's like the liquid of the ooze and the muck with the sand now, like bone sand just kind of forms together in this. Gritty. Yeah.
2335.38 2346.46 speaker3  Is it like when you throw sand on diarrhea? Thomas.
2343.66 2364.66 speaker1  It's like throwing sand on diarrhea And with that, the other skeletons are still coming down. It's your turn. You're in conversation with John Lee Pettymore III.
2360.50 2365.58 speaker3  He's given me a mild embrace with his tendrils.
2364.66 2371.26 speaker1  That's right.
2369.66 2385.62 speaker3  like you would like someone's hand and I'm like kind of like affectionately like grabbing it. Yeah, grabbing. the metal tendril as though it was John's. Yeah, he's patting your shoulder
2384.54 2415.14 speaker1  with his metal tendrils and you put your hand on the metal tendrils
2412.78 2450.82 speaker3  He's kind of hanging limp and there's just a silver ball floating a few feet above him. And it all feels right though. As you feel more and more tendrils moving down your spine
2449.98 2453.02 speaker1  No, no, no.
2450.82 2484.50 speaker3  Just attach yourself to it. and he's part of that wheel of fate now. So we can also nix all that. I want Don to still be a character, but essentially he and John might just be talking heads. I don't want to take away all of John. I just literally took away all of Justin's character's agency, which we can. I just thought it might be wicked cool.
2483.58 2488.74 speaker1  Justin, how do you feel? Yeah, how do you feel, Justin?
2487.82 2527.10 speaker3  That's totally fine. I'm just curious of your motivation for wanting my body. Okay, that's what I don't know. But I kind of imagined John and Don as a second Nick and Mick and they're just heads. Oh no. That are literally like, okay, so imagine the tiny ball and then thick stocks of tendrils coming down forming essentially two legs with Don and John and it's just running around like an at-at.
2525.54 2539.86 speaker1  and we'll see what comes of that. You look next to you
2536.90 2730.82 speaker3  that has started to come down from this very tiny ball and he kind of looks over at you expectantly and with a smile. He says, Don, I know in your life you were mostly an outlaw but I was a law man and that means I'm here to help. So that's what we're gonna do here today and I need your help with that which is why I've taken your body from you but I still respect your criminal mind. and look around at what's going on here. I've taken over your central nervous system You like Star Wars, Uncle Don? Love Star Wars, boy. Where are the legs of a little, The scout trooper, right? What does AT-AT stand for? Attack, attack. The AT-STs are the small one. Yeah, AT-AT is the four legs, AT-ST is two. with the minds of two wily Pettymores, chicken walker. and we're gonna be where we're needed and help who we can. Does that sound amenable to you? when this starts happening, as he's like finally able to like let go of all the stress now that he's no longer in control. And he's like, it sounds wonderful. and then you get wicked whiplash as this thing runs off towards the skeletons. one more time for me? What's the setup? Imagine, imagine a tiny ball with the legs of an AT-ST. So these tendrils have come out and they formed into thick, powerful leg trunks. and where their shins and feet would be, that's the, those are the bodies of John and Don with their heads at like the kneecaps. Yeah, but they look cheerful. Crying kneecaps. Great turn, great turn. Good job, good job.
2726.70 2739.52 speaker1  but rather it is the ball John that has been repelled
2736.58 2767.96 speaker3  Basically John Ball is taken aback by being repulsed from Ballmary. He's floating there for a second and then he sees her starting to open like the portal. Starting. He sees her starting to open the portal and very quickly long spindly like tendrils shoot out of him. He's trying to move the material of the world back, like fill it back in where she's opening the portal.
2767.12 2773.36 speaker1  I dig it.
2769.92 2786.36 speaker3  He's just like trying to scoop the world into her hole.
2784.88 2792.22 speaker2  All right.
2788.56 2798.84 speaker1  and so if you can pass yours, then this happens.
2798.00 2816.72 speaker3  Well done.
2815.52 2828.24 speaker2  Keith has just
2823.84 2896.52 speaker1  with this liquid nitrogen, this frozen material completely creating an ice luge like a water slide down there at Splashylvania but in winter time as if the entire encasement tube has been frozen and feet first he goes right on in there and Keith, let me tell you, the things that you see blow your fucking mind because you are now just surrounded in this ice world. surrounding you all around you and on the other side of it are just dazzling shapes and colors, large shadows, just all of these movements like you're at an aquarium, like a psychedelic aquarium
2893.80 2968.08 speaker3  like to the esophagus or whatever. Keith looks around and he's amazed. He's kind of like entranced and he's just kind of staring off and looking at the shapes and the shadows and everything and then he snaps out of it and he remembers why he's here or whatever part of the body I'm in. I feel like that's gonna be good, but let's find out. so my punch is extra strong.
2964.68 3016.08 speaker1  You can grab onto one of these frozen insides, pieces of this thing to kind of raft you, help you hold on to the top of this water as waves are unnaturally coming at you from left, right, from front, from back. They're going past you. They're coming from within you. Like it's just, the water is not reacting like normal water and as you're looking up over the top of any of these cresting waves, you see worm after worm coming up, diving back in. You look down, you can't see anything. You can't see your body. You can't see your feet. The water is completely dark and looking above you, your sky is a luminous ground that this fight is being fought on and that is your ceiling.
3014.24 3020.56 speaker3  I was under the impression there were two,
3019.08 3043.32 speaker1  Yeah, there's more than two. Well, that's not good. I don't know. fuck, I should not have done this. That's exactly what Keith thinks.
3038.32 3087.16 speaker3  Yeah, he finds a door-sized frozen piece of worm and he climbs on top of it and he looks and he sees a worm come up like a dolphin would or something. And he lunges at the worm that's near him. That's so bad ass. Also, I'm glad you're up in the sky, but now it makes a lot more sense why you went there if you thought like, after you got to that first worm,
3084.76 3092.80 speaker1  like halfway done, there's only one more.
3090.68 3130.64 speaker3  Keith is like, well, I'm here anyway, so might as well just get to it. Doers get it done. and you heard whirring inside of him. How many turns did that take? One. Oh, cool. almost imperceptibly at first, but then it's faster than you can really imagine. And he's heading towards those fucking skeletons like they're bowling pins. Yeah.
3129.24 3155.52 speaker1  and Planet Juggernaut, I mean, this thing is spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning, and then all of a sudden it launches itself up into the air and is going to take out and fitting their nine bowling pin skeletons left in the air, which is how many are left after I have thrown one bowling ball. Cause it's like I only hit one.
3154.04 3162.44 speaker3  It's wild that you can only hit one with the bumpers even.
3160.32 3170.48 speaker1  Yeah, we put the bumpers on and played golf rules. Exactly, lowest score.
3169.08 3176.40 speaker3  It sounds like you created something here that we got to give a try.
3175.56 3180.72 speaker0  Yeah.
3177.40 3216.08 speaker3  Bowling golf is going to make us a million bucks. It's going to be huge. From the creators of the fuck barrel. that puts out some audio entertainment, at home leisure projects, and we also run a professional sporting enterprise. Products. Personal. Look on your foot sheet.
3215.24 3222.40 speaker1  Two D12.
3219.80 3234.00 speaker3  I had to remind myself when I was searching for it.
3233.16 3271.20 speaker1  Hell yeah. when it grabs Drew Andrews I mean the body of Councilwoman Kerry pages, about how fucking cool this is.
3268.08 3341.92 speaker3  So you mentioned that they're flying down from the air. So Planet Juggernaut has flown up to meet him, almost like he hit a ridge in the world but you can't be sure. Something strange happens. As Planet Juggernaut is rising up into the air, heading towards these skeletons, he kind of blocks your view of them for a second. you see just like a string of ichor shooting back up into this thing's mouth. And where Planet Juggernaut hits the ground and starts rolling again, you see like black chewing gum just stuck to the side And you see like some rib cages and shit sticking out. But these things are just like completely waffled on him.
3337.48 3365.20 speaker1  think about an AT-AT and think about Luke Skywalker and think about this Gigantumbropithecus and think about how you've got its tongue.
3362.12 3369.40 speaker3  you just see him starting to take a long, graceful turn around the feet of the Gigantumbropithecus.
3368.56 3387.20 speaker2  Yes. Awesome. Yes. Oh, and as Planet Juggernaut picks up that spare, we've gone through another round of combat here, Nick Nichols.
3385.88 3390.56 speaker3  Planet Juggernaut.
3388.88 3402.68 speaker2  Praise be to the Juggernaut. Now, did you think, Nick, that it was going to be one episode per one round of combat here?
3401.12 3463.56 speaker3  It happened. was waiting for everyone else to take their turn forever. One of which was Justin's.
3454.56 3463.56 speaker2  What kind of world are you living in? What kind of world are you living in?
