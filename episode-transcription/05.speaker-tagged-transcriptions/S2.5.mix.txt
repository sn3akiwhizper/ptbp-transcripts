0.00 8.28 speaker1  Hello, my little listeners.
5.16 27.64 speaker0  And I'm here to sizzle myself up and feed myself to all of my hungry little babies. Make sure and take a Pepto, baby,
24.92 41.32 speaker1  as a pop-up barbecue restaurant. While we digest and digress, why not see what the adoring public is saying about us, shall we?
37.36 62.48 speaker0  This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from KDB in West Virginia, who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Park. A quick and easy way to make wolf feel loved and supported. KDB writes, hello, coming at you from the land of the cryptids, almost heaven, West Virginia. I've been listening since early season one,
60.16 80.88 speaker1  and I'm loving all the eldritch horror who I will eventually convince to listen
78.84 146.20 speaker0  And stay safe out there, wolf. We can't have the horrors that be stopping you from your wonderful hosting. it's that the horrors that be should be terrified of me. There is no horror that I cannot simply consume. Any deranged beings out there that don't fear respect me If you want to write up something How, you may ask? Just play some golf inside the libretto. that also in those sweet delicious network revisions
144.56 160.68 speaker1  Let's make a deal.
157.44 174.76 speaker0  into the 24 hour city news family. But Beck and Cal actually remembered the evening's post printing press. Beck was heckled by his disappointed mother Kim
171.96 183.48 speaker1  with his daughter Carol, which is great.
179.00 227.48 speaker0  and definitely will not devolve into unadulterated madness. Probably, but keep your chin up. I've got a fresh little ditty here for our fifth episode of season two. Prepare yourself for a brand new theme song.
225.48 300.12 speaker2  And it's all my fault cause I like thought I was choking. Well, it was like, I was having a dream where I thought I was choking. Then I woke up, do what? and I was just like breathing it in. And then this morning when I took a shower, I was like, Oh, I got to blow my nose. And I blew out a chunk of like dried blood that was like this fucking long. and I get them all the time cause my dad made me do cocaine when I was a little kid. It's cool. Your dad sounds cool. This is my mom and my plug.
298.52 388.48 speaker3  In that order, I love my mom. And as you're looking around the room, you notice that the producer of city action news, Ty for Rayland is nowhere to be found. He's normally at the big chair at the head of the table here at this long table in this beautiful conference room. Isabella Kaya, the head anchor city action news, who was once co-anchor with Cal Colorado, but now is the sole lead of city action news. She walks forward to the front of the room and stands at the head of the table. As you may have heard, Ty for Rayland, at the city tower with the who's who and whatnot. So I'll be handing out assignments today. Quick question, just as a newsman. Cal raises his hand. Who is who and what is what not? She giggles to herself and gives a massive eye roll to the sports person and the news person who work here. Shay Star. And Shay Star, nice, well done.
386.64 391.40 speaker2  I knew Shay Star, that's two S's.
388.48 397.60 speaker3  It's two S's, Shay Star, well done. You said the meeting was at city tower, you called it? Yeah, the city tower.
395.20 401.60 speaker2  And it's shaped like the Teen Titans building.
400.76 414.16 speaker3  You like that? Yeah, I like that. All four of us. Springfield is the headquarters of the Teen Titans.
410.84 433.48 speaker2  Dude, the Hammond's tower is the Teen Titans building. Okay, no, it's not. It's similar looking. And the Hammond's tower has giant T's on the side of all four sides.
432.32 438.96 speaker3  No, it has like.
437.40 463.48 speaker2  It's like a big blob at the top. The T on top of the Teen Titans tower is literally as long as the building itself. looks exactly the same as Teen Titans tower, but I'm saying if Hammond's tower looks like anything, it looks like the Teen Titans tower.
461.76 467.32 speaker3  like the Teen Titans tower. You're right.
466.20 501.52 speaker2  Motherfuckers. Like a T with a bottom T. Hey, guys, Google the Hammond's tower I know right I am, at indoor two underscores living.
499.44 518.48 speaker3  The Hammond's tower would be, the Hammond's tower looks like a T
516.84 519.96 speaker2  Yeah, look at that, right?
518.48 523.30 speaker3  I think that you would be hard pressed to find anybody who wouldn't go, huh,
522.48 540.68 speaker2  when you saw that. Huh, looks a lot like the teen Titan building. cause guess what, I speak the truth.
537.84 590.06 speaker3  So he's busy at a meeting at the city tower, but you guys are here in the conference room at City Action News Studios, where Isabel Acaya is handing out the assignments. Okay, Cal, I actually got you something pretty great. It's an exclusive. Yeah, you with me? Asclusi. Yes, you got Asclusi. Under his breath, he's like, Cal stabs his leg with his pin under the table. and your whole team here. Just so you guys know,
588.08 599.00 speaker2  I act like I didn't say anything.
594.56 642.36 speaker3  Okay, so yeah, it's Asclusi with the Gato company. and someone out there is gonna show you around apparently. I don't know, Fred Gottel, and kind of the whole crowd is like, holy crap, won't be there. And everyone's like, ugh. As you know, he likes to be on camera as little as possible when he's not fully in control of the narrative, Not sure what that's about. Actually, this might just be like a wild goose chase, who knows? Can't reveal the source at this time, I'm being told.
641.04 653.00 speaker1  I mean, I could take a look at that and I might be able to find a trace of who maybe dropped the pin or whatever.
649.68 664.68 speaker3  On your way out, just see who was the PA, who was the intern who was running for you guys. Oh, that's a fantastic question. He can't look Julius in the eye right now because of what happened during the printing press.
663.12 666.24 speaker2  He ripped my fucking...
664.68 670.92 speaker3  Yeah, it's the one who ripped your shirt off because he was like fucking plastic.
667.80 679.14 speaker2  During the rip, I can't wear that suit anymore. During the rip. I don't remember a lot from that night, but I do remember who did that to me.
676.12 706.56 speaker3  Somebody get the intern, what's his name? And literally no one in the room can remember his name. And this like very haphazard looking, bug-eyed boy comes running in. He's like, oh yeah. And he brings you a, who would it be from? Who would get the tip?
702.08 711.80 speaker2  There's just like the constant emails that come in and they scour through like what is the intern. The email goblin.
709.84 741.40 speaker3  All of the messages incoming from social media and stuff come to my phone. So yeah, it's this. if you wanna head out. That's, I think I read it was 83.6 miles away. So you're gonna wanna get out. That way you can get back in time. that someone dropped? Yeah, and she like smiles at the rest of the room.
738.92 756.28 speaker2  Julius gets up from his seat and looks at her and it's like, oh yeah, by the way, my uncle says hi.
755.20 769.18 speaker3  Who are you? Oh, you're producing for Mr. Cal. Mr. Cal, have a good time.
768.16 775.14 speaker2  I certainly will.
772.78 796.70 speaker3  As you guys head out out of the conference room and heading out towards the front door, you see him, he's pacing back and forth somewhere. He's just like talking to himself. I just kind of do a quick run up to him. Hey man, can I like check out the email that you got Yeah, absolutely. And he takes the phone from you and scrolls through it and clicks on it and hands it back to you.
794.86 800.46 speaker1  with either CompSci or Cygant.
799.62 803.22 speaker3  Go computer science, please.
800.46 807.42 speaker2  I'm trying to find, go fucking CompSci on that phone.
805.82 810.42 speaker1  and all sorts of things.
807.42 814.18 speaker2  In the meantime, I do want to text my uncle and like see what's up.
811.70 822.34 speaker3  Luke, you can text your uncle. That was always allowed. Oh, he's doing it in game now though. Oh, oh.
819.90 828.52 speaker2  Could you text your actual uncle and tell him I say hi?
827.68 866.22 speaker3  No, text Dave. I ain't got it. It seems that it was run through. You can tell it's actually a specific IP that VPNs use and you recognize it as being like, oh, they blocked where they came from.
863.72 874.92 speaker1  We might want to have our wits about us. I don't know if this is like above board or whatever because they're like hiding their tracks. He's a little bit tricky, but I'm a little bit rock and roll.
873.76 885.48 speaker3  I think we can do it.
883.24 894.86 speaker1  it's like a follow-up to the story we did in the corn in the crab farm, right?
892.72 900.44 speaker2  I was also speaking in jest earlier.
899.44 903.72 speaker1  It was a good one, man.
902.68 906.76 speaker3  Anchor good?
905.64 915.56 speaker1  Thank you, Beck.
913.72 989.08 speaker3  and Isabelle Lacaya is standing there We figured you might need another pair of hands since this seems like whatever. You don't know what it is. So we figured since you're out for the day, we'll send a PA with you. She said her name was Stevie and then Isabelle Lacaya disappears back into the conference room. And you see Stevie is a scrawny little dude wearing cigarette-legged jeans in an oversized black hoodie. She has earbuds plugged into her ear holes and a thick wall of dark wavy hair covering their eyes, nose, and top lip only revealing a black lipstick-covered bottom lip pierced with a small hoop. There are the flappy parts around. Hi. I'm Cal Colorado. Hi, Stevie, it's nice to meet you guys.
987.26 994.38 speaker1  Is this the first time that Beck would've met this person? Because it sounds like somebody who Beck would be friends with, for sure.
992.06 996.90 speaker3  Yeah, this is a new, you've known it.
996.06 1002.36 speaker1  Good to meet you. Hi, yeah, it's nice to meet you too.
1001.44 1010.68 speaker3  I'm digging yours too.
1007.72 1012.22 speaker2  like trying to figure stuff out before we leave.
1010.68 1015.90 speaker3  I'm Stevie. Take him back Sunday?
1015.06 1046.88 speaker2  Okay. Like Chick-fil-A? Like Chick-fil-A. having no idea what Chick-fil-A means. Dude, taking him back Sunday like Chick-fil-A Julius, absolutely not, looks back up and just says, make damn sure.
1045.68 1090.36 speaker3  Yeah, nice. but I'm sure you'll gel quite well with the team. We're happy to have you along today. Thank you, Mr. Colorado, sir. It's nice to meet a legend such as yourself. Thank you. Thank you, young person. And to work underneath you and Mr. Wilder here, who has, I mean, a long and storied history as a grade-A cameraman. of a producer title for the two of you.
1088.68 1096.40 speaker2  and he puts his phone in his pocket.
1094.32 1101.42 speaker3  Any caffeinated beverages?
1100.02 1105.16 speaker1  Totally.
1103.04 1131.84 speaker3  And for you, Mr. Summers? Yeah, I'm sure I could find some.
1129.70 1147.04 speaker1  but it's kind of eaten up at Beck that he couldn't crack that phone. He felt like this was an easy thing. You find out who sent a pin. That's like iPhone shit. That's just basic shit.
1144.04 1151.40 speaker2  he wants to drive, but he's gonna wait and see if the intern is gonna try to drive or not.
1149.66 1164.22 speaker3  Well, you guys, just the three of you out there. Oh, just three of us? Yeah, while she's grabbing your drinks. Is that where the pin is?
1163.40 1208.92 speaker1  You nailed it. That's where we're going. Somebody told us that this is where we gotta go Yeah, you know when you're looking at a map on a wall and you're saying, hey, I've been there before, so you take a thumbtack and you put it in there? It's like that. That's where the pin is? Sure. And he hands Julius the phone. I said, oh shit, because he rolled a 65 also. I don't know if that's.
1206.76 1214.20 speaker3  Oh, I thought you said, oh shit, because he nailed it. Even with luck, I wouldn't pass my roll.
1212.16 1221.02 speaker1  Back to the conversation Beck and Colorado having. I'm worried that you think that we're gonna go there and find a physical pin there? And that's not the case.
1219.32 1224.52 speaker2  Yes, someone dropped a pin and it's the key to unraveling the Gato Corporation.
1223.32 1237.96 speaker1  Now I see what you were asking. For sure, dude, no. So there's not a physical pin when we get there. This is just like the lingo we use today to say like, go to a place. You dropped a pen.
1235.60 1250.72 speaker3  And this pin is where that pen is?
1246.72 1260.48 speaker2  called either Google Maps or Apple Maps.
1258.04 1269.88 speaker3  Yes, my daughter drops pins to me all the time.
1268.88 1271.72 speaker2  There's no pin.
1270.88 1272.56 speaker1  Other than.
1271.72 1281.04 speaker2  Let's not rule out the fact
1276.66 1287.12 speaker3  and Stevie Gotel is closing the door to the can van after getting in the driver's seat and.
1285.72 1295.18 speaker1  Or is that just a slip of the tongue? Stevie gets you out to the Gotel company.
1292.64 1299.20 speaker3  This MPC seemed really cool, but I didn't realize they were a fucking plant
1297.92 1301.92 speaker1  for the Gotel board.
1299.20 1306.32 speaker2  Can I go pee and then figure out
1305.20 1308.32 speaker3  Go for it.
1307.48 1315.96 speaker2  I'm just kidding. We're gonna stick a pin in them.
1314.88 1325.56 speaker3  Just yes and it. Oh yes, she's a Gotel.
1323.48 1341.76 speaker2  We have your grandchild.
1340.08 1342.68 speaker1  We know about the pen.
1341.76 1351.56 speaker2  Let's get going.
1348.88 1379.28 speaker3  that you're having, you notice that Stevie has gotten into the driver's seat of the can van and has slammed the door and started the can van. And she rolls down the window and is like,
1376.20 1416.60 speaker2  Yeah, Julius hops in and he's scrolling through TikTok to see like what kind of cool stuff we can do for a TikTok this time. but I'm sure that that's what he wants. if the van had been robbed while it was parked outside the studio.
1413.84 1420.60 speaker1  So how are you guys doing with that Julius? He's back at the station.
1417.92 1441.68 speaker3  You were very good about like not jamming like that. If you're like a role player, like,
1440.20 1463.94 speaker1  Isabelle Crane has, or. Isabella Caya. Isabella Caya has sent us to investigate a secret company town, which is really fucking exciting Okay, cool.
1460.84 1466.94 speaker3  Well, I'm like, why did I have to find this out
1463.94 1499.96 speaker2  from Isabella Caya and not my uncle? But then also looking up the songs we should use in the background of our TikTok once we make. Julius kind of glances up and just goes, put them on.
1498.62 1562.50 speaker3  Oh, fuck yeah, she does. Okay, so you guys head outside of the city. Immediately your can van jammed in this city traffic just right off the bat and it takes a while to get out into the interstate. And Stevie's staying pretty quiet until you get out on the highway. But once you're out, she kind of looks in the rear view mirror and she's like. So do you guys, do you guys believe in ghosts? Have you seen one? No. Do you guys think aliens are? I'm just like, I just want to know
1559.80 1594.00 speaker1  Just probabilities or whatever, my dudes. They gotta be out there. Who? It's like a spooky dude who's like into spooky stuff on a show. You're like that dude.
1590.24 1614.38 speaker3  into different directions and then it kind of dies down again and she gets that same sort of sound in her voice and she's like, well, what do you guys think about like, do you think it's possible to be like rich and be a good person? Like, do you think money corrupts absolutely?
1613.54 1618.18 speaker2  Well, I mean. More money than you make.
1615.92 1622.72 speaker3  Well, certainly more money than I make, but I mean, if we're heading out to talk about.
1620.02 1626.64 speaker2  Well, we all certainly make a lot more money than you, but does that make us bad people?
1625.08 1639.24 speaker3  Well, I guess that's what I'm asking. Do you think that making more money has made you a worse person?
1634.60 1659.18 speaker1  like for all year and in that pocket there was 20 bucks and I took that 20 bucks and I took Cal and our old producer out to the foundry and I got them all shots with it. So I mean, I guess I'm kind of a case in point that it doesn't have to corrupt absolutely.
1658.28 1666.50 speaker3  I like that.
1665.18 1681.58 speaker2  have to worry about that.
1678.90 1700.74 speaker3  No, I'm saying that as like I remember. No, it's not.
1696.82 1707.48 speaker2  That's like Monsanto money versus KY3 money. Well, like better than KY3, but not like generational
1706.64 1710.94 speaker3  billions. No. Exactly.
1709.14 1726.34 speaker2  But Julius likes to think that it is. what I've said that.
1724.54 1728.94 speaker3  We're all rich Luke in friendship.
1726.34 1738.58 speaker2  You know that like Julius knows he's rich. Okay.
1736.70 1747.04 speaker1  to treat you differently because of it? The first because of the second.
1744.08 1788.62 speaker3  you exit the interstate to a highway, to a smaller highway, to a country road, to another country road. And the only signs around are for attractions behind you with an easy place to turn around within a minute of each sign. And eventually the country road goes from asphalt to gravel and a sign says road closed ahead, please turn back. and kind of holds it up near the rear view mirror to show you guys.
1787.50 1801.78 speaker4  Should I just keep going? How far? It looks like less than a mile. Keep forward going.
1798.46 1844.72 speaker3  It twists, it turns, it's a gravel road. The gravel road turns to dirt. And at this point, there's just no signs anywhere. There haven't been like streetlights for miles at this point. Here you see a sign that says stop dead end, no outlet. it says danger road closed. I think these signs are designed But we're the looky news. At this point, Beck is, like I said,
1842.76 1863.26 speaker1  But at this point, he's kind of crawled up to the front between the passenger and the driver and is filming out the front, getting good shots of what we're seeing as it's coming up on us.
1858.26 1888.74 speaker3  The dirt turns into a thick wall of brush. And it goes left and right in all directions. And it's actually so thick, almost on either side of the road that you wouldn't be able to walk too far into it Waist high, though? Yeah, after a little bit, yeah. It'd be about waist high. So we can see over it? Oh, no, no, no, sorry.
1887.06 1894.56 speaker4  On the left and right, it's waist high.
1892.42 1913.74 speaker3  of just thicket and trees. And there's kudzu laying over the top of these trees so thick that you can't see through it. You can roll me an intelligence at a negative 40 if you'd like.
1912.90 1940.88 speaker2  98. 40.
1937.30 1954.62 speaker3  It seems seamless as it grows into it all, so.
1951.02 1957.98 speaker2  I'm not sure that's the correct term,
1956.74 1964.30 speaker3  What is the correct term?
1963.46 1971.50 speaker2  If we're talking out of character. It's bum fuck Egypt.
1969.70 1985.78 speaker3  you were totally right about that, but. Oh.
1983.22 2013.78 speaker2  Somebody on a Reddit thread says bout fucking Egypt, which is just dumb. It's gotta be about your butt, you know, because that's what you fuck. Julius makes that joke, and then like whether or not Cal liked it, he feels a deeper connection to Cal,
2012.54 2040.70 speaker1  We've stopped the van at this point. Yeah, it's. Like the road has ended. and go as close to the thicket as he can and just kind of shove the lens in there and do a big, as hard, as big a zoom as he can on this lens. And just see if he sees, if the lens penetrates better than his eyes can, what's ahead.
2039.66 2045.50 speaker3  Videographer.
2043.06 2052.98 speaker2  can I roll to see if I can find like a, something to cut through these vines?
2050.74 2058.92 speaker1  I have an 80 in this and I rolled a 90. No.
2056.66 2068.98 speaker4  So as you shove it into there, you feel that it gets almost like trapped in a spot
2066.34 2092.20 speaker3  You kind of pushed it in where it kind of latches back onto them as you try to pull the camera back out, but you're able to kind of wrestle it out without damaging the camera at all. And as you look at through the viewfinder of what you just shot while it was out of your view completely,
2089.88 2129.28 speaker2  As this happens, Julius is like, he's the new producer. He wants to just like get to the story as fast as possible. And thank you, I knocked my ones off earlier. Giant scythes on the wheels there still. The van used to have like little like curtains.
2128.00 2135.28 speaker3  Forward, Stevie.
2131.96 2154.00 speaker2  so that like people could edit in the back while they drove. But now there's just no windows. Laying down underneath one of the seats, there's like the slider thing that the- Curtain rod. The curtain rod, yeah. So I grabbed the curtain rod.
2152.24 2166.40 speaker3  and you start swiping through. And as you're doing that, Stevie's kind of gotten out of the van as well and is putting her hands in it and just kind of like moving them around.
2164.72 2175.48 speaker4  And then you guys hear a boom.
2171.36 2178.92 speaker3  with something thick and steel with this rod.
2178.08 2188.44 speaker1  Oh shit.
2187.60 2193.00 speaker3  The hard parts.
2189.56 2196.76 speaker2  Before I hit the metal, did I like cut any like foliage?
2195.52 2208.88 speaker3  from where you've dunked the plant life growing up on it and around it.
2206.92 2211.16 speaker1  and started filming what's going on there.
2209.72 2230.88 speaker2  Yeah, Julius is just gonna use the curtain rod to try to like scrape stuff off of the like metal
2228.28 2260.32 speaker3  As you push the thicket and brush and all of this plant life out of the way with your curtain rod, you push enough away to show where this paint on the steel is showing. There's actually an arrow and you reveal an arrow that's pointing to the left. And as you push more away, there's above it, it says door. What color arrow? You move some more, it's a yellow arrow.
2259.04 2266.24 speaker4  Fuck, it's a green arrow.
2263.72 2267.68 speaker3  And green is pretty industrial and like a...
2266.24 2274.24 speaker2  Yeah, good choice. And like a modern evil corporation that wants to hide that it's an evil corporation.
2273.40 2282.76 speaker3  That's right. Yellow on like steel is just classic bad guy shit.
2279.80 2285.44 speaker2  to like get some footage of what I've just revealed.
2283.60 2287.68 speaker1  Beck sets up a nice shot that has it centered.
2286.28 2314.40 speaker2  Yeah, I wanna just start clearing whether it's like scraping or swiping or whatever I need to do to get to where that arrow is pointing.
2313.56 2329.76 speaker4  while it can.
2326.20 2333.84 speaker3  You are actively getting moist while doing this work.
2329.76 2349.78 speaker2  And I'm like whacking, I'm like, I'm going all out while I'm doing it.
2346.20 2374.72 speaker3  her second canned cold brew of the trip. And she brings over one energy drink to Mr. Wilder and brings another Coke over to Mr. Colorado. She somehow kept it cold. She's like, I brought a cooler. Stevie, you are...
2371.44 2388.20 speaker4  A newsman without words, oh wow, what a compliment. Stevie, would you? Am I a wonder?
2386.52 2395.12 speaker2  And hands her the curtain rod.
2391.64 2416.16 speaker3  but like when we get Coke as a sponsor, I'll be the one laughing. You guys are gonna wish you said monster.
2411.72 2422.52 speaker2  but there's like one foot of like solid curtain rod.
2419.24 2440.68 speaker3  push up against the steel where you've left off and then drag it forcefully to the left is just kind of heading toward this arrow. You guys have made it probably eight feet of clearing by this point and it's taken like 15 minutes.
2438.04 2460.24 speaker2  to see if I can find more of an easy point of access? That's a 66 on a 60, that's a critical failure.
2458.10 2506.78 speaker3  like trying to point out something and a bunch of our progress is eliminated, I think, And Cal, as you trip. I think I see something, fellas. You trip and knock over a bunch of vines which at first everyone thinks is going to cause a deep impediment but it actually reveals a thick metal hatch door. And as you begin to pick yourself up off the ground, you look down and see that you have fallen into poison oak.
2504.96 2512.92 speaker2  It seems like you really screwed up and that's the bad thing that happened.
2511.56 2565.64 speaker3  We never saw the hatch. Cal's like, no, my news hands. you're gonna be at a negative 20% because you're gonna be dealing with how itchy you are. To everything? It's gonna give you a plus, it's gonna take away 20 on everything but it's gonna give you a plus 20 on grip because you're way more focused on your own body than the world around you. Plus 20 to climb. Like physical pain keeps you distracted from- From your mental pain?
2564.80 2575.02 speaker2  Yeah. Flagellation, baby.
2572.12 2596.50 speaker1  Whoa, Cal, you did it, man. That's the door. No, no, Cal. Yeah, all right. Yeah, let's see if there's a pin.
2594.50 2605.86 speaker2  and you're the face. And I try to open the hatch up.
2602.70 2655.88 speaker3  As you turn the wheel of this enormous metal hatch and with almost a free momentum without giving any weight push at all. Like a normal door, like a normal door. I thought you said it was a hatch. like a thick metal doors like in a submarine. Yeah, like a SpongeBob door. Exactly. Gotcha. Yeah, this is magic.
2653.46 2658.34 speaker2  Okay, cool, I gotcha, perfectly.
2657.26 2672.62 speaker3  Like 007. Just to make sure.
2669.42 2677.98 speaker2  that we were previously hacking at, right?
2676.86 2687.78 speaker1  Cool.
2686.42 2780.62 speaker3  In fact, it's quite bright. And as the three of you walk through, Stevie right behind you on your tail, carrying all of your gear. Beck has a tail, by the way. Riding Beck's tail. Listening to Julius' tail. is a vast opening with plenty to unpack. This bridge is a minimalist construction showcasing the steel that seems to be the only way over this deep, wide and foggy ravine. a single simple steel train car is waiting in a simple steel single train car sized train station, presumably here to take you across this awe inducing chasm. On the outside of this minimalist depot, above a wall of lockers is a sign that says, Welcome to Grover's Gorge, founded by Frank Godel in 1945 by necessity, not choice. My life is great And it's all my fault
