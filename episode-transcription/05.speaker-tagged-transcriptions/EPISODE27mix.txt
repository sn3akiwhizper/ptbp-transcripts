0.00 132.02 speaker0  Come tidings to all of our listeners here on KITI City Radio, where the only thing softer than the vibe is the K in our name. I'm your host, Steve Innsmouth, filling in for Barry Nasti for the foreseeable future. Let us slide right into what is, personally, to me, my favorite segment, in my opinion, within the show. It's time for, Hey There Steve, where listeners here in the city can send thoughts and opinions to be read by me, your host, now and forever, Steve Innsmouth, your host. This listener wants to remain anonymous, but I think we all know there is no hiding when you open your stupid fucking mouth and try to speak truth to power. They write, Hey there, Steve. Big fan. Love the new direction for the show. Anywho, wowee, are things getting out of control here in the city. When the hospital caught fire and killed all those innocent children, we all said, wowee, it can't get worse than this. But Goobers Gracious did it. With the death of Ferguson Beans following Bruce Robin to sell off Raw Beans Industries to an overseas conglomerate, the unemployment rate has skyrocketed. We need someone to step up and do something about it. Wow, yes, and that's not to mention the catastrophic news of the evacuation of our neighboring town, Contention, due to a chemical spill from what was once Perdition, but is now unincorporated land west of the soon-to-also-be unincorporated town of Contention. Well, if there's one thing we here at KITI City Radio know, the only thing most people do in the face of abject horror and conscious destruction is to chill the fuck out and listen to House Fire by Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin. Oh I distinctly remember where we left off.
127.92 152.92 speaker1  Taylor is normally gone for work by seven. What time does school start? I don't know. I think she has to be there like
150.92 392.16 speaker2  constitutional and Heard footsteps in the living room that walked very carefully into the guest bathroom and Then closed the door and then it was silent So fast like out of my chest and my contacts weren't in and I was pooping silently wiped and then like got up and like tiptoed across my room in my underwear and put in my contacts and then Got my phone and dialed 911 and like had my thumb like ready to call it and I like creeped down the hallway and The door is closed to the guest bathroom and I couldn't hear anything coming from inside and so I tiptoed past to the kitchen and I grabbed my chef's knife and Then in my boxer briefs Holding my cell phone with 911 ready to go and a chef's knife in my other hand busted into our guest bathroom and She she was home sick Busted in on my sick tired early morning wife with with a knife That's hilarious. How was that? We were both horrified Exhausted and panicked. Hold on. I want to hit that one more time Open and locked into place on the side of the hanging plexiglass room But he slips on the blood from the young boy beaten and prostrate. He looks terrified You realize why when the ceiling begins to lower it is slow But ceaseless the weekend champion boy scrapes and crawls just quickly enough To slide into his cube of metal bars as the ersatz ceiling closes in on the perforated floor eliciting a guttural moan from the now deceased crushed juiced boy The blood rains down onto the gaudy and deranged crowd below many holding their mouths open and tongues out Like an innocent child trying to taste snowflake The cages attached at either end of this hanging chamber one holding the tired winner and the other vacant Unlock and detach moving along the ceiling mounted conveyor belt and through a dark exit in the far corner away from you John Lee Pettymore Keith Vigna Clark Bishop you sit smushed into cages alongside Doug Jacobs and FBI agent Trent Chad's body a Man, so massive his muscles are bulging against the metal bars and a boy who looks so underfed and sickly He could likely slip right out of the cage. I want to fight the boy
389.96 475.52 speaker1  Like the world's most elaborate ninja What Wow, Oh blender would be cool for another like It's extremely good. Yeah, it probably is. Yeah likely anyway Shit I rolled it too and then knocked my microphone over as I
473.52 532.32 speaker2  Well Keith just saw himself Did get juiced? In his own mind so Like an elongated room in the middle hanging above and then separately on the walls like all along the ceiling are Different conveyor belt lines and they can move the cages all around the room. Gotcha Okay, and you guys are on one side of them up against the wall Well, there are only six cages and you're three people Yeah, Chad in agent Chad's body. Hey, hey Doug
530.32 615.48 speaker1  Calm down buddy. It's alright Do you still feel like you need to do everything we say Just do you want me to I'm like also, yeah, if if you fight one of us and you lose your nightmare is over and you'll wake back up So I kind of like look at both of you and I kind of like make like the shooty gun hand and then point to my underwear and I'm like So I don't I like kind of like do some kind of motion to try to get you guys to know That I have it out loud
611.56 746.88 speaker2  Some kind of sturdy rod at least like two points gotcha So you could probably shake a little back and forth, but it's not gonna move very much Doing so however elicits no response from the crowd below as they are far too concerned. Just Raging like they're drinking How powerful is John Lee Pettymore stream solid you just make him do a p-roll. Okay. Yeah, that's right. Can you roll? At a negative 20 John Lee Pettymore struggles to remove his penis from his underwear to urinate on the crowd below He slips within the cage and falls dick first onto the bottom of the cage and you fall right on the bottom of your shaft and as you begin to urinate it is Red as it comes out and a couple people who are closest to where you're at who are part of the crowd notice and begin to bathe in your You would notice I think especially Clark Bishop wouldn't would know the faces of these people
744.48 765.24 speaker1  Someone in a position that looks like they are Controlling this event like a MC or like the host of the game that's going on
761.64 838.96 speaker2  Sitting at the bar is a lone figure who is Dressed in all black. He is of Average build he's about six feet tall. He has light brown hair and a mustache He is wearing tight black pants and he has a dead stare with scars on his forehead and neck You can see very well from what you're at Laid out pretty bare Really? There's just this bar on one side. They're seating all around not in the splash zone that some people are in but the majority of the crowd is in this middle section with couches and Yes, absolutely papa songs from Pier one
835.22 864.86 speaker1  They blew their budget on the blood dome, yeah Does he stand out as somebody whom he's the only guy at the bar, right? Yeah, okay Necessarily and most people aren't in the blood pit. Most people are Oh are okay
860.50 905.88 speaker2  Most people are there's just a few sitting about and even they might be, you know a bit splattered
903.88 929.80 speaker1  Like try to get their attention Yeah, are we gonna wait until we fight or or like do you have a plan to get out? I have no idea what to do right now
927.60 962.44 speaker0  Clark is purposefully remaining silent but Keith just kind of sent him into a panic realizing that there is no plan and He wants to start like shaking at the tops of the cage the sides of the cage
960.04 1060.60 speaker2  they just as quickly release as Clark begins moving inside of his cage toward the plexiglass room hanging above and one other cage also begins moving to the other side of the plexiglass cage and in it resides a sickly sad tired looking boy, the cages make their way to either side of the plexiglass room and Lock into place before the doors Open and a buzzer Sounds the crowd goes wild crawls out and stands as tall as he can and then begins hitting his chest as Hard as he can and he begins screaming at his feet just
1055.68 1085.20 speaker1  Can I like look at my cage and see like obviously one end opens up into the plexiglass? Find which edge that is and see if there's any way to like get it open before it hits the plexiglass
1079.62 1094.10 speaker2  I know that you have the skill of locking but you don't have the tools with you and there's no lock on your cage
1090.02 1125.08 speaker1  So I am able to identify which side of the cage opens up It's not gonna be right now, but for sure
1118.16 1157.08 speaker2  Clark you feel a tiny foot run straight into the side of your head as this boy is Flung himself through the air at you and you did not see him coming you take one point of damage as he rolls across you and You hit the ground
1155.08 1165.44 speaker0  Hit my number exactly exactly
1163.80 1221.88 speaker2  We all do. Yep In his attempt tiny orphan legs shattered Pin you to the ground So I would like you to describe as this kid tries to grapple you what you do with his body
1215.76 1232.92 speaker0  Because he's a small little boy and I'm a big man and I use that momentum to flip around and I'm now on top of him
1228.40 1309.56 speaker2  Pass you see his eyes begin to widen as he looks up and you hear the creaking of the ceiling begin to He's gonna try to grab your hands your arms your forearms to push you away from him
1305.42 1341.30 speaker0  Into the ground and then when I feel like I've got him like within an inch of his life I'm doing a my hardest right hook to the face
1339.30 1406.50 speaker2  He's like, I'm sorry sir, I didn't so With one last right hook your fist connects and moves through his baby fragile chin and His neck kind of goes limp as he hits the ground It is up to you what you do next as it's not this boy's turn because this boy Dustin uproariously giggling all of them The ceiling is
1405.26 1417.08 speaker0  helipass
1412.82 1457.84 speaker2  Where you felt that tightness this morning when you woke up in a cab? but you push through the pain and grab this boy and begin to drag him across and toward your cage and When you get there, do you throw him into the cage first or do you get in? Happy we love you. Happy birthday promotion Clark and it's it's
1455.84 1489.84 speaker1  It's that Michael definitely Clark
1487.84 1535.72 speaker2  cage becomes electromagnetic and you feel an Intense burning shock going through all of the skin that's touching the bars of your cage Stand on the kid. I need you Oh
1530.72 1552.64 speaker0  But I want to push it toward the put into the plexiglass room so that it's not in the cage at all All right, I'm just staying like that for a little while
1549.04 1638.12 speaker2  the ceiling touches the boy's head and then it's lower and lower and Clark shoves the boys lifeless limp body onto the floor of the plexiglass room as the ceiling comes down and smashes completely leveling this boy's skin and bones Into this weird pulp this dark oily pulp that begins Raining down on the crowd below who are losing their fucking minds. They are Along the line and it's heading toward the dark exit that the other boy had gone through But at the very last second it stops and you have full sight of the room It's for a plot reason and not so that you can just stay in the room 50 yards away from your
1636.12 1654.78 speaker0  No, so I need to do sanity
1653.66 1846.24 speaker2  Let's I know cuz in fact I I would even venture to say that being because like exhausted and not quite in touch with reality would make it alongside a Doug in the FBI body as well as a extremely large bulgus man and You notice both of us. No, I said bulgus. Okay Which means like a bulger bulgarious exactly And So He I am cage fighter and my brother Elby, he he owed the glass family lots of money and I went to fight in the scrap pit for him to try to earn this money and You know, I was quite good. I was quite good at it I still am and I was winning all of this money and my lifestyle became more and more Extravagant until I couldn't afford the lifestyle. I wanted to live any longer and Marvin glass a lot of money and They mostly throw children at you and that is fine. It is nothing to kill a child It is much easier than beating down say a planet juggernaut. I
1839.90 1914.04 speaker1  Think about the possibility of me having to fight this guy and I start silently sobbing to myself and Then I look up at the part of the cage that I had found opens and I try my damnedest to open it up
1909.10 1959.56 speaker2  You almost get it unlocked and as the cage door Begins to unhinge and move out of place you feel the most intense burning sensation All over your skin that is touching these metal bars and you take For damage putting your hit points at what for Which also locks into place in? between you is a bloody pulpy pool and your cage doors open I
1956.84 1988.90 speaker1  And get my gun out and I just start shooting Down at the bottom of the plexiglass to see if I can break a hole into it
1981.80 2026.32 speaker2  Especially an extremely powerful gun that's super small for some reason exactly. I brought probably the best one with me You're just shooting a gun into the ground as long as you don't hit yourself actually go ahead and roll
2024.92 2078.40 speaker1  okay, so I Petty more and I lock eyes. I Pull out the gun and I just start in a circle shooting and I see as each bullet hits The plexiglass cracks a little more and petty more sees the cracks I start jumping up and down and I'm I'm expecting if we go like I'm looking at the motherfucker Fat ugly motherfucker in a papasan right below me as I'm jumping
2074.60 2170.42 speaker2  Freaking out and super into this like they are so excited right now Except for like half of them who kind of understand what's happening I think three times circular plexiglass punctuated perforated platform land Square on top of the fattest ugliest motherfucker you've ever seen sit in a papasan chair That's a fat guy's in a papasan guinea Oh, so you've been to top post yeah Yeah So top all time as this happens the crowd begins to go wild and you are now Amidst this crowd who does not know whether or not to continue to soak up the blood of those who have fallen or
2163.40 2224.22 speaker1  To run away in terror. The first thing I do upon landing is aim my gun at Kevin And fire a single shot hoping to hit his chest roll firearms. I
2217.58 2238.98 speaker2  Ascot flowing out from underneath one of his vests and you just lay him the fuck out
2236.98 2316.72 speaker0  Be careful my dick Maybe maybe I'll get somebody to look up and I'm really trying to spit on them
2312.24 2366.76 speaker2  It's everyone else's turn and the crowd begins to dissipate Situation that they are just lapping up the blood on the floor Snorting it licking at it everything they can do to get others blood in their body
2363.36 2419.24 speaker1  So dick, what do I need to do to use some luck here? And I jump off my feet into the air and trying to just like grab on to him
2415.06 2500.52 speaker2  slams your head directly into the bar and you take Six damage, okay Kevin slams your head directly into the bar and you go blank completely unconscious and You are bleeding out onto the ground He looks down at you and then with completely cold dead eyes just walks away. You're dead He's just gonna move on. Okay, I I Clark, what do you do? How's the spittin going? Oh, man, you'd like you've hit one out of every ten spits Which is good. It's really good. It's a far distance to spit. You know, you gotta at least get ten yards
2497.68 2533.36 speaker0  I shake so hard. I shake so hard. I 13 on a 45 nice
2530.20 2563.12 speaker2  But you're able to continue and fight through it. I I
2560.32 2601.78 speaker1  Stop dead in my tracks when I see what happened to Keith Zach wrote that entire
2598.66 2642.18 speaker2  You get this weird feeling because You you feel like you know him. It's almost like you recognize him But you don't you've never seen this this guy before And his cold dead stare straight at you for just a second flickers and His eyes change and they look at you with this remembering and Then it is immediately back to these cold eyes
2640.18 2651.50 speaker1  At a negative 20. Yeah 52 on a 60 so you fire a couple rounds
2645.86 2690.02 speaker2  completely shaken not able to even hold this gun steady at all you miss and And He stares at you and then he just runs out of the room as fast as he can
2688.02 2715.64 speaker1  It could work Let's see Doug flips the obvious like lever
2712.14 2785.14 speaker2  Clark is rocking back and forth in this cage hanging next to an empty dark void leading to another room and John is standing at the bar all the people in this room are freaking out and Running here and there and the last few of them trail out of the room as you hear a Snap and Clark's cage falls to the ground and breaks open upon impact Clark you take
2783.14 2785.14 speaker1  30 luck to come back You sleep in it all day
