0.00 333.44 speaker0  Welcome, my flock. It's your pastor, Wolf the Dog, and I'm here to give you a sermon about the merits of garbage collection. We are the only trash-based ministry that will broadcast you all live from 694.2 PTBP. I pray for y'all every day, hoping that a bounty of trash will fill your bellies, as it always does mine. For some reason, my producer keeps yapping on about how it's December the 6th or something, and it's about, like, 4 PM or something thereabouts. I don't know. I just wish he'd stop yammering. Time means nothing in the house of the Lord. Wolf bless you, my children, and Wolf bless this mess. It's a new Howlin' with Wolf. This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from AtMeganIsANerd, who tweeted about the show way back in September. She writes, Dear Mr. Wolf, While my fellow agents and I were investigating some issues in contention, we became trapped in some kind of temporal anomaly. My colleagues have been scattered to the four winds of time, and your broadcast seems to be the only constant. To Chad, Drew, and Sabrina, if you can hear this, I hope you catch up to my timeline soon so we can properly theorize about what the hell is going on here. Looking forward to catching your house with a full pack soon, Mr. Wolf. From Megan. Well, Megan, my voice has been known to permeate through time and space. I beckon, but only a scant few hear the call. I know Chad, Drew, and Sabrina will hear your message, because any chosen will hear a message when I so command it of the cosmos. Haha, but anyway, I do truly hope your friends find you instead of being caught in some sort of horrible alternate timeline from which there is no return. Remember, if you want to write up something for your wolf to hout, tag at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter. I've pretended to be people on Facebook. Fuck you, Zuckmarkerberg.

Five bucks a month instantly unlocks access to seven exclusive bonus episodes. The most recent one is a Q&A episode. Zach discusses his campaign notes. Justin reveals his relationship with me, Wolf the Dog, but I don't know who that motherfucker is, y'all. Luke and Thomas come up with names for Contention's Army Surplus store, and Joe tells the story of a legitimate alien sighting. So legitimate, in fact, it could be up next in the news. The perhaps second iterations of the formal Contention police officers got an address and phone number for the target. The co-founder and current majority shareholder of BarCorp, Bruce Robin. Maggie Cook tossed them a folder full of information about BarCorp, including a connection to Jesus Christ Ministries, the $2 billion projected gross profits for next year, and the listings for the other three entities with the highest stake in BarCorp. Stacey Beans, Francis Beans, and The Mill on the other side of the city, and then she burned John Lee Pettymore and dipped. Our wasn't properly tenderized, brined, and marinated, and no one wants to eat me, not even the dog. Wolf spit me out. I'm swept up, thrown in the trash. I am nothing. At the landfill, I land on a plastic bag named Phil. She's sweet, but I can't provide nutrients to a
326.32 343.72 speaker1  up. My podcast app says November 18th. Yes, so the first episode got released because I submitted it to iTunes for approval, and then they just uploaded it as soon as they got approved. So then we did
338.80 354.08 speaker2  our official launch later. Okay, I'm glad that you said that because it was incongruous in my brain that I was sure that we had our launch in December. Yeah. Okay, that makes sense now. Yeah, yeah. I was
349.68 420.96 speaker1  actually thinking about this. Do you want to put out a special one-year episode where we just party which again, just this like sickly thickness hanging in the air, and you see these flowers window and you feel like physical resistance when you put it out, but it's probably just the wind.
416.32 520.56 speaker2  reach cars. Mr. Yeah. Mr. Hawkins just couldn't get through. John, at this point in your life, you're going to go in one of two different directions. You can't just keep turning left
515.36 661.04 speaker1  there's flowers and Luke's an idiot. Yep. And there's a thickness in the air. And I love him. in glass all the way from the bottom to the top. It's beautiful. And you can see as you're walking in, there are marble columns and the entry, the foyer that you see after you pass through the fun seven of the same like shitty company. It can be a windbreaker. It can be a t-shirt or whatever. They all have that like gray cottony cloth on the inside. Yeah. Okay. So we found three blue ones of those that are just blank. Um, could have been for a sports team. Yeah. You, you find, yeah, you find them there. They're all, they all fit you well, pretty nondescript. So you can make
656.64 673.36 speaker2  I'm keeping my uniform on it and just putting the windbreaker over it. Okay. So Keith Vigna,
667.44 697.44 speaker1  big cargo shorts, a like bright orange polo. I believe that's correct. Sparey's boat shoes Keith. It's December and it's gotten pretty cold. So you've got goose pimples all over your shins,
693.44 747.28 speaker2  connected to the pants too. You know what I'm talking about? I put that on. Overalls? and then I just ditch the clothes that I came in. So you're just, you're just free and easy
739.92 821.36 speaker1  before, but wearing what you're wearing now, Clark, Keith, Pettymore, you guys show up to a security guard and a secretary sitting at a large marble desk on the far end from you. And behind them, there's an extremely large mural painted on the wall. And it is the painting of George Washington crossing the Delaware, except for replacing all the guns are flowers. and you would see that the floors are separated into different departments within Bar Corp,
816.56 872.08 speaker2  a role or just a knowledge that Clark would have, but reading the directory, are there any businesses or institutions that spring out as that's a contention thing that we know for sure
863.52 877.44 speaker1  Uh, 47 on a 60 for persuade. The silent security guard motions that that is okay and the secretary
872.08 926.96 speaker2  sitting nearby is too busy looking at the computer screen to even pay attention. Does she have a
919.60 943.28 speaker1  you see that there are buttons for one through 12. Uh, you guys just want to go to 12 and I assume Hey buddy, we're supposed to be on the 17th floor. This only goes up to 12. He points to the, it's a different elevator. Grazie. And I've been learning Italian.
941.44 962.00 speaker2  Did that come with the Kevin body? Did it?
957.20 982.64 speaker1  you hear, uh, as he gets on a little, uh, walkie talkie. Do we hear what he says?
978.72 1004.80 speaker2  Is there any advantage to maybe not going straight to the top, to have to kill so many people. You've got that prepared, right? You've got, you've got all,
999.12 1024.48 speaker1  all 16 floors just started out. Oh yeah. I make stats for everybody.
1020.32 1064.00 speaker2  just come right out? I just thought it out there. It's a part of the, maybe an element of surprise
1054.08 1152.72 speaker1  a very dope outfit. Her blouse is white satin and the left half is black striped vertically. The right side is stripped. It's striped backwards. So yeah, they're catty corner. which she has folded neatly together. She has silver rings and it seems to actually just be one 58 or a really, really good 72 type or somewhere in between. How old are you Winifred? That's exactly not the
1147.52 1163.52 speaker2  Well, ma'am, I think it's pretty obvious from our very official windbreakers that we're the police.
1159.28 1251.28 speaker1  Beans, sorry for you, I suppose. That's what you'd like to be known as these days. The internet? Vast. So much knowledge. Just at your fingertips. It's a picture of Clark Bishop and it says, John Lee Pettymore is no longer my best friend. Friendship with John Lee Pettymore ended. Vigga is my new friend.
1247.36 1257.76 speaker2  Police business, ma'am. This isn't a friendly call. It's a work call.
1255.52 1289.52 speaker1  are we the only ones here with her? Yes. Yeah. It's not like a busy office. This has a long hallway and the floor is marble and the walls are lined with similar murals as the one that you saw upon your entry. They are Renaissance America. Wait, what is that time period called in America? The early.
1285.28 1302.56 speaker2  He's asking what you call that type of art that Crossing the Delaware is, which I don't know. Boring.
1300.40 1311.92 speaker1  Thomas doesn't know, but he knows it's not that. Sure. It's one of them.
1310.08 1347.36 speaker2  Are they all flowered? Yes. Yes. Mr. Robin's the only person in the world who might understand. Can you see it in your heart to let him ask these questions personally?
1342.72 1375.92 speaker1  Yeah. I'm going to have you roll against her instead of at a disadvantage. She passed with a 26. I passed, but with an eight. Which would have been great if this wasn't contested. She whispers up into your ear.
1375.52 1384.40 speaker2  Okay.
1382.72 1386.32 speaker1  Yep. She passed with a 17.
1384.96 1414.08 speaker2  Oh, that's what he got. Yeah.
1412.40 1436.56 speaker1  I just sit far enough away. So describe what you push with. And then I just like fucking suplex her to the ground.
1432.56 1480.08 speaker2  And I, I see this happen and I run towards where I think the office is. It's just the door at the end of the hallway. Big double doors. We're really hoping she looked bad for 50. Basically, this got really sad.
1478.40 1511.84 speaker1  The good news is she ain't getting up. Well, maybe you should have let a grieving man talk to the only person in the world who would understand. I think you're white claw sorry because you're adhering to no laws. I'm sorry.
1509.20 1522.08 speaker2  And we'll get an ambulance on its way, but we got to do it. And I just keep walking by. Okay.
1518.24 1546.16 speaker1  I kicked that out of her hands and I'm like, I'm so sorry, ma'am. I'm going to do the dialing because I don't think you're just going to call the hospital. I think you're going to call the police on us. Okay. And I'm like, you know what? Robin. 911, what's your emergency? Oh my God.
1545.12 1552.08 speaker2  Bar court building.
1550.88 1577.36 speaker1  She's a tough old bean. Sir, if you could stay on the line for me, what's the address of the bar court building? Keith Vigna. And what is your mother's name, sir? Winifred Worth.
1575.92 1580.16 speaker2  You just say beep into the phone. I say beep and hang up.
1579.44 1610.48 speaker1  Sir, you're still... Sir, I heard you say beep. Okay. to roll alertness. I've got 60. Got a 70. Gonna get some dice with numbers on them. You turn around to see Winifred pull out another cell phone from her other pocket.
1609.68 1626.96 speaker2  Winnie. Winnie now.
1625.92 1634.08 speaker1  Well, you made us do it. I didn't feel like that. You wanted it.
1632.40 1635.12 speaker2  You set this whole situation up.
1634.08 1644.08 speaker1  I'm so sorry.
1643.68 1668.48 speaker2  I am. I kick it out of her.
1668.08 1679.68 speaker1  Damn it. Can we be friends here? After all this?
1679.04 1686.16 speaker2  Come on.
1684.96 1696.56 speaker1  I'd also like to search. I got a 45 on a 50. Winnifred for the keys. Okay.
1695.28 1705.52 speaker2  And I'm like, what if she is the key?
1704.96 1715.60 speaker1  the armpit. I picked the lock. Pick the lock. And Thomas John, Kevin Lee Pettymore hears the door open as you're going toward Winnifred
1713.36 1725.92 speaker2  to try to find the keys on her. Okay.
1724.32 1833.22 speaker1  You don't find her third cell phone. To your right, there's a wall entirely comprised of a single large bookcase that seems to have been recently fingered through books at a time, some of which have been left scattered about the reading area haphazardly. large binders, and loose papers. Ahead of you is a large desk in a similar condition and five deep button high back to leather chairs that sit in a half circle facing the desk and the panicked, pacing man behind it, jerkily moving back and forth in front of the large window that makes up the back wall of this office, giving you all a bird's eye view of the city somehow both lackluster and rancid. Bruce Robin is muttering to himself. How do they fit? Just right. Well tailored. These pants. And a white shirt, no tie, top button unbuttoned, and a crushed red velvet like burgundy smoking jacket. And his hair is all askew just like mop style all over his head and it doesn't suit his face or the way that he is dressed. I need you all to roll alertness, all three of you. Fail. Fail.
1831.94 1863.38 speaker2  62 on a 70. Mr. Robin? Yeah.
1861.46 1867.86 speaker1  Hey, what are you guys doing up here? Well, we came to talk to you, sir.
1867.22 1876.42 speaker2  I heard that. What were those? Roll human.
1876.10 1876.90 speaker1  Yeah.
1876.42 1897.06 speaker2  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 47 on 80. You got 80, human? Yeah. Fuck yeah, dude. Numbers. I know. No, no numbers for me.
1892.90 1901.94 speaker1  8-1-1-8-1-8-1-9-5-2-0-1-3-1-1-8-1-1-1-9. Yeah.
1899.14 1909.94 speaker2  No, Bruce no likey, Bruce no likey. Well, you just said Bruce did likey. Come on, come on.
1905.70 1917.22 speaker1  Hey, guys, come on, come on over here and sit down, sit down in these chairs right here. Yeah, come on, Bruce likey if you sit down here.
1915.54 1925.46 speaker2  Yeah, Clark doesn't take a seat either.
1917.22 1940.42 speaker1  He immediately walks over and there is a glass on his desk, like a rocks glass, and he picks it up and he holds it in his hand with like white knuckles and he walks toward you guys and he's like, I think maybe you should just probably just sit in the seats, right? Yeah, yeah, we can talk, yeah.
1938.74 1956.98 speaker2  Clark puts his hand on his gun. All right, well, come on down, come on down.
1956.18 1988.82 speaker1  the other side.
1986.50 1999.22 speaker2  I'll stand near a chair, but I'm not going to sit in it.
1997.54 2004.18 speaker1  Yeah, yeah, all right, well.
2000.18 2010.10 speaker2  Can I do a check that we're not standing on like a trap door?
2009.06 2018.26 speaker1  Roll dexterity. No, you can roll search, I guess. I was afraid you were going to say that and I don't have it.
2016.42 2023.14 speaker2  I fail, 97.
2022.82 2025.30 speaker1  Okay.
2024.18 2048.82 speaker2  He just stares at you. You can answer his question, Bruce.
2043.62 2079.62 speaker1  blood on his knuckles, like from a cut or scrape or something, or from punching. He's also wearing a silver ring with a blank, flat top on his middle finger on his left hand. Is that one of the rings that we found at? Jim Cook's house. Okay. And when you rubbed it.
2078.18 2080.58 speaker2  Or when you put it on, I think.
2079.62 2090.02 speaker1  Oh, the M. It was the M made out of four double helices.
2089.30 2098.20 speaker2  Yeah, it was in there. It was in the kitchen or in the kitchen. Yeah. And then we came back and looked at it.
2097.70 2104.50 speaker1  Yeah, I did.
2102.82 2126.10 speaker2  Yeah, you do. Show him the goddamn ring. but I don't say anything. Both.
2122.82 2131.62 speaker1  Are you, uh, are you with?
2130.98 2134.90 speaker0  Jon does that. He waves.
2133.78 2168.66 speaker2  He's like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. They made the androids.
2167.62 2174.18 speaker1  No, you out of character. We can just talk about what you guys know about Marietta.
2170.66 2188.02 speaker2  We found all those folders in Jim Cook's secret room in his house. And folder one was called operation stapler and it had the M helix. And we figured out that that meant myriad. And it had to do with the respecking androids to cut down on costs to sell to other companies.
2186.58 2191.22 speaker1  And that's when we also found. Yeah.
2188.18 2199.30 speaker2  We also saw the same M logo hole puncher.
2194.34 2208.02 speaker1  But we also saw the myriad logo on the Android who attacked us outside of, uh,
2206.10 2220.10 speaker2  that has that symbol on it as well. but I never put it on. Okay.
2219.22 2270.76 speaker1  Confirmed. With his head slumped down, tongue flitting back and forth across his top lip, Bruce Robin's eyes shift up to stare past you through a messy curtain of unwashed hair. And he begins chanting. Okay. However, I'm going to give you a plus 40 for your pulp Cthulhu talent that you took to do combat first.
2270.26 2282.50 speaker0  Cool.
2281.46 2287.46 speaker2  Yeah, baby. The crit trumps the low, the fact that I'm still lower, right?
2286.34 2292.82 speaker1  It absolutely does. Yes.
2288.26 2318.58 speaker2  I Superman leap across the desk, landing the punch in flight. I think that's going to probably tackle the chair over and we'll be playing on the ground, but I've knocked the fuck out of this dude's jaw. I failed.
2318.26 2322.34 speaker1  Yes. A punch from Clark Bishop is the exact same.
2320.58 2331.46 speaker2  And you hear a snap as a sip. That's the exact same damage.
2327.86 2350.74 speaker1  As you tackle him to the floor, you actually see. Oh, hi. A pistol in his hand gets knocked just out of his reach. And he had grabbed it underneath his desk with his head down. Dude, I wanted to say, I was starting to haunt him. Han and Greedo like gun at the table, but I didn't.
2348.74 2358.90 speaker2  So I'm really glad you knocked that gun out of his hand.
2356.90 2364.42 speaker1  I want to jump over the desk as well.
2362.10 2372.18 speaker2  and then pull the ring off of his hand as well.
2365.54 2375.54 speaker1  Uh, roll unarmed combat against him and I'll give him a negative 40 for being pinned. Essentially, I got a hundred.
2374.74 2382.10 speaker2  Oh shit.
2380.10 2382.82 speaker1  and you fall on your ass.
2382.10 2390.18 speaker2  Oh no.
2388.90 2415.62 speaker1  Anything I can see. It's on his desk. Okay. All right, so you're going to roll strength against him and I'll give him a negative. He passed with a 31. I failed 54 out of 50.
2414.58 2422.98 speaker2  How we are cool.
2419.70 2425.62 speaker1  So you can't make it through his big old chompies.
2424.66 2428.10 speaker2  Can I punch him again?
2427.22 2453.22 speaker1  Uh, yes. And he will actually go now. So he's gonna make an attempt to get you off of him. Okay. Uh, so if you're going to punch him, he's going to roll on overcomded against you as well. Contested me and you. Yes, sir. Okay. I fail. So he simply gets you off.
2451.22 2462.58 speaker2  That's a wrap on pretending to be people. Thank you, Bruce.
2460.90 2473.08 speaker1  And he's gonna grab the gun. So he, this round is able to grab the gun again. He has it. So it is Clark Bishop's turn.
2472.58 2476.34 speaker2  Yes.
2473.94 2485.70 speaker1  And he is continuing his chant. You can hear it right now in the background.
2485.46 2495.62 speaker2  Yeah.
2489.14 2520.26 speaker1  He's on his back on the back of the chair with his like head on the ground and his legs like up in the air. Keith is on his ass trying to recover from getting like brush hour two flipped on his back and John Lee Pettymore is like straddling him trying to get this tie in his mouth. Temporarily.
2519.22 2525.62 speaker3  Is he holding the gun?
2521.30 2550.50 speaker2  I think I would, I mean, whatever, whatever role you need for, I would be keeping my hand on his hand, keeping that gun away. Okay. I crit pass with an 11.
2548.58 2574.26 speaker1  It is impossible to disarm him. Oh, no. And he is like far more maneuverable at this juncture for this round because of that critical success.
2573.54 2595.22 speaker2  I see the gun. No, I don't. He says nothing cool. He just reacts immediately and pops one.
2593.70 2601.54 speaker3  My new windbreaker.
2599.78 2620.58 speaker1  It was $2 and 50 cents. Half off yellow tech. Yeah. Motherfucker. You can answer our questions.
2618.02 2624.10 speaker2  I want to just like smack him in the face with my pistol. The bottom again.
2621.54 2632.82 speaker1  I actually, I forgot to have Luke roll damage. So roll a D for damage. Unless you, did you grab at this point?
2629.22 2636.34 speaker2  Do I have my tiny gun or do I just have a service pistol? You have your tiny gun.
2634.66 2654.42 speaker1  Do I have a service pistol as well? Yes. have one. There was just like seven sitting around that accord. Yeah.
2653.70 2664.50 speaker2  You guys want a gun? I got some.
2664.10 2782.58 speaker1  Okay. So man. Okay. the floor pooling in this chair. It is one of those chairs that we like to describe on this show that has the buttons deep pushed in. So there's blood pooling like syrup in a waffle into the back of this chair. Nice. Thank you. Thomas, go ahead and roll a human. Okay. When you do that, stop that. That's what I know. I'm a little exasperated with him. Down the hallway and see what Winifred's doing. As you turn to look back down the hallway, your ear starts ringing because a gunshot just went off. And as soon as you turn around, you see Bruce Robin has pointed the gun to his own head and has committed suicide in front of Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna. I need you all to roll sanity except for Keith Vigna. Who does not have to roll sanity when humans die. That's correct. Crit fail 77. I'm at 14.
2779.94 2793.86 speaker2  Keith walks over and gets the ring off his finger.
2785.14 2806.98 speaker1  And when you turn around, you see that John Lee Pettymore is writing on the desk in blood. Two, one, eight, two, one, three, five, one. Thomas looking up, you have no recollection of writing this. Do you stop him before he's done?
2806.34 2853.54 speaker2  Yeah, for sure. I mean, it's freaking me out that he's not responding. all adding up to something bad. So Clark is putting a stop to that as quick as possible. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But Hey, uh, listen, Maggie sent us here to kill this. Fuck. I guess Clark is kind of bewildered. Nodding one.
2851.38 2854.18 speaker1  Do those, do those numbers mean something to you, John?
2853.54 2900.18 speaker2  What numbers? Those. And I pointed what he had been writing on the desk. Those, those numbers that you were writing on the desk, does that mean something to you? I can't, I'm a little shook up. I must've just been writing the last thing I remembered. Keith puts that ring on. So I've got two, two of them on. If I like touch them together, does anything happen?
2895.30 2941.30 speaker1  three of you realize you aren't standing in the same places. You were just standing and none of you are wearing clothes, but you are completely covered in warm blood and written in the same fresh blood from the lifeless body of Bruce Robin is a new set of numbers covering everything in the office, the floor, the walls, the window, everything over and over and over and over. It repeats two, one, eight, two, one, three, five, one, eight, one, five, two, nine, one, four, and you have no recollection. Cause nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows.
