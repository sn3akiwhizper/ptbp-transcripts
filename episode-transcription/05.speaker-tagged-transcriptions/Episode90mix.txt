This is a bit of an unfortunate time to be here in contention. See We done had a handful of disappearances lately nothing wild usual suspects the whole saloon staff and the bartender miss kitty piano player a few gamblers the town drunk You know if half of them went missing in one go not sure anyone will bat an eye but almost ten folks within the span of a week Not that I blame them.

774.28 789.24 speaker3  Peppa Pig dying brutally
787.04 803.84 speaker2  Tips were not great except from those guys
801.04 944.30 speaker3  Just go ahead and leave and I'll text you one at a time Joe and then it'll be Justin and then it'll be Thomas and then it'll be Luke cool. I can play a game Justin's egg pod. I Oh your character's name is
938.58 957.22 speaker0  Character and Luke was actually the first one to present one and it was the best written thing. I'd read in a long time
950.16 970.90 speaker3  Like a private message and I was like you have to send this to the group so that they know what they're up against
967.08 1077.58 speaker0  So no one knows how long Everett Pace has been in that old Low slung sod house on the bald spot of the hill just outside of town He's just always been up there old Everett folks Ammo supply and once or twice a year when he ventures to the saloon for a drink as though he's celebrating something No one ever bothers him though He just looks off an unruly mess of long gray beard and an attempt at a greasy comb over on top He's got a sickly dirty complexion and walks with an uneasy slightly hunched shuffle But his eyes are bright and wild and fiery and only add to how off-putting his whole presence can be The town folk do catch glimpses of him up on the hill though He's often tending to a sprawling garden Butchering the day's hunt or chopping wood he looks so old and frail but each pull of the hoe a cleave of the cleaver a Swing of the axe reveals muscles that have been at least tuned to the work for ages Mothers in town use Everett as a boogeyman telling their children if they wander too far at night He might snatch them and can them up like the radishes and Brussels sprouts in his cellar and the kids believe it because they can't tell when or if Everett sleeps a flicker of a lantern in the wee hours of the night and the occasional but sudden crack of a rifle being fired off towards something Unseen and unheard makes the kids pull the covers up extra tight at night
1072.70 1108.06 speaker3  Just right over the nose they're holding their their sheets tight and They're thinking about Everett With him like what? What is he what is he doing? Is he out on his property? Is he inside the house?
1103.38 1130.14 speaker0  It's that he's uh, he's he's lived his life on this land protecting it as his own it's it's his his parcel in this world and He he guards it he he'll uh, he'll stay awake at night to make sure the crops don't get to and he'll he'll shoot a wolf if he sees one coming up or a Raccoon or any sort of thing that Threatens his and it's exactly on one of these nights
1128.14 1197.58 speaker3  Everett hears a Grumbling in the distance and it's on his land and Everett Everett knows exactly what direction it's in. It's not it's not where the animals are. It's not where his garden is He lives off the land Yep, damn, that's fucking cool. We're Moving and you know that it is coming from the direction of a spot in the ground Where there is a cross made out of sticks
1195.50 1268.38 speaker0  Why would there be a sound over there? Did I mention in my description that my guy is an old man? Oh No, I don't think you did. He's 65 or 68 years old and he's kind of frail in general He thinks of himself as kind of a loner and a weirdo. He's kind of open to weird shit So he's got the highest sanity of a character. I've ever played at 80
1266.38 1286.30 speaker2  80. Oh, yeah
1285.42 1333.06 speaker3  Ah but there were a fair amount of disappearances to the point to where people are them
1328.46 1361.14 speaker0  So the grave is I would I pictured it. It's like I said, he's on a bald spot I would picture it near the tree lines. So maybe like 20 yards like he's got a good plot up there
1359.14 1393.18 speaker2  I
1392.74 1396.38 speaker3  No
1394.74 1458.30 speaker0  I read that they think that Back in the day of a person's sleep cycle was much more of a farming cycle that they would take like a lot of naps But be awake for a lot of the night Because they had to protect their areas. So he's he's a he's awake a lot of the night. I love it I'm getting in the car baby. I'm getting in the car. I'm coming over there
1455.54 1494.10 speaker3  This is the show where we talk to each other But not as each other because even in our friendships we rarely talk about things that matter It's always bullshit. So we may as well have a podcast where we're completely different people
1492.10 1562.88 speaker1  Oh
1558.64 1598.56 speaker3  Day in the life if you a quick description day in the life kind of situation. Yes
1594.88 1705.88 speaker0  He's just hit his 40s graying ever so slightly Dark tan skin from manual labor. He's a he's a rancher But unlike a lot of other ranchers he tends to do a lot of stuff by himself He hasn't really found Help that he would consider up to his his standards Basically runs the whole shindig himself. He wakes up quite early in the morning probably 4 or 5 a.m. At the crack of dawn Mm-hmm feeds his two dogs Chuck and Bob who are scruffy mutts that he took in Makes a strong pot of coffee and a big ol He mainly raises and trains horses, which he which he loves dearly Few cows here and there and some goats just for the extra cash, but he really loves the the majesty of a big ol horse Checking him out making sure their health's good He patrols the area for any trouble cuz I assume he has like a big swath of land that he has to you know mend fences But at the end of the day, he either goes to the bar to grab a drink or seven having an excellent time or Alternatively, he stays completely home with a book sitting on his porch with his dogs only lit by the light of the lantern and The the glow that reflects off a bottle of whiskey
1703.64 1732.92 speaker3  one or two or seven
1730.92 1756.20 speaker1  I Help me Justin has me trapped here
1752.44 1800.72 speaker3  Just say now roll a d4 for how many hours it's been
1795.04 1823.52 speaker0  some of the guns on here were like nine dollars, so I'm gonna say four dollars here is a
1819.88 1834.44 speaker3  I would be useless maybe even two these days I can't keep up when I was a young man ten shots

1835.92 1936.32 speaker3  Child in the saloon and the piano player is not playing right now cuz no one's paid him is that he's a jukebox and He needs to get money in order to play song. So it's dead silent right now So he's just talking to one of the gamblers who's around here and he's like, oh, yeah, no, I swear to God bad It's a girl teenage girl walking around the new mine over there at night You saw a teenage girl over there at that new mine I don't think Silas had to have the balls do something like that and the other piano players like That's right. What's random and Smart head on top of them their shoulders that she's got nice broad strong like could easily take a man like Silas cause she truly wanted to and there's no reason she would want to deal with that kind of nonsense in his Blessed life praise be Lord Does Jack join in the conversation at all
1935.08 1994.32 speaker0  He just doesn't like Participating so he's kind of he's keeping an ear on because he wants to know what's going on in the town There's a nice cool breeze. He'll take it outside and kind of chill but you know, you know how Ranchers in the Old West love to chill Take it mad easy. Keep it mad posse
1990.72 2003.24 speaker3  There was on a stick and they were just you know Net stick and chill

You see a thin silhouette dipping off fast into the distance So almost a football field away You see this this very slight figure that is just Running and with that roll. You can see it's a humanoid but it's running like But you could chase it through the wild if you could track it
2205.52 2228.44 speaker0  Well, I need to roll two dice, please
2223.04 2257.32 speaker3  There's something in contention that is not human and you look up at the stars and it's a clear night sky and as you're kind of like The world isn't what you thought it might have been if something like that
2255.32 2269.60 speaker0  injured it is 40 I pass whatever this thing was

2299.60 2320.14 speaker1  I
2317.92 2378.76 speaker0  I cock it and I look at it Jack looks away wipes a couple tears away from his face and gets back on his horse to make the rounds to make sure Everybody else is safe I

2447.62 2461.54 speaker2  Naturalist a paleontologist He searches for ancient creatures from the past and they're fossils and and and they're remnants
2457.94 2469.38 speaker3  Sick, does he just put bones together and call it what he thinks it is
2465.02 2510.14 speaker2  Huxters in his like profession do that, but he is a trained naturalist he he's at the cutting edge of modern of modern theory when it comes to paleo biology and he I don't know if that's a word back then but that's that's what he does man. That's what he lives and breathes Delta green monsters Zach has in store for us that professor Horace Horace Green
2507.98 2547.34 speaker3  Like a day not just for me but also for you to get to learn about your character even more through the I was telling Joe earlier. This is the best decision we've ever made for
2541.66 2707.80 speaker2  This is a cool mechanic before you run a game that being said I didn't know it would be read publicly So I will have to self-edit and clean this up as I go along because I sent Zach just a filthy Although he has generally been awake for an hour or more at this point Staring at the ceiling or the curtains or a sleeping cat easy it Observing but not quite seeing these things as he lets his jumbled rush of thoughts flow freely Until they have sorted themselves into something like order He picks his way through the stacks of books that litter his floor and heads downstairs to the parlor Where the widow Anderson is already waiting with coffee He stayed at the hotel the first few months he was in town But he found himself in frequent disagreement with that establishment over payments and acceptable level of cat excretions Returning from his shell one day. He found the hotel and employed the washer woman's daughter to clean his room He opened the door to see her rearranging his table of vertebrae and promptly fled to the washroom to weep Since then he has stayed at the widow Anderson's boarding house She rises as early as he does and enjoys stiff coffee and silence in the mornings The other boarders are young men They leave quickly in the morning to make their shifts at the mine and stay out of the saloons until late at night The widow is content to leave Horace to his vertebrae and his cat enjoys her company when he is away Following the creek a short distance out of town He comes to the rocky outcropping that he hopes holds the answers to his most burning questions And so Horace begins his work He chips and digs at his shale looking for signs of the monsters who once roamed this land It has been months and he has found nothing like the vertebrae that first brought him here They plainly belonged to a mosasaurus, but he had never seen or read of any specimens so large Local children will sometimes come down after their morning chores to help the crazy old professor sift through his rocks and mud But on this day is alone by the early evening He has found no signs of his mosasaurus and returns to town Making a point to stop by the hotel restaurant to enjoy his supper before changing out of his muddy clothes He cleans himself at the boarding house and reads the evening papers with the widow while he's he had sleeps in his lap He retires to his room where he will read or respond to one of his many professional Correspondents or diagram as vertebrae hearing the young boarders returning from the saloon. He knows it is time to retire He tells easy at good night

2848.48 2984.06 speaker2  Judge Ephraim Cortland. He is a very tall large man 43 years old but looks Just soars all over him from like barely washing and not washing his clothes Always has like grease and food in his mustache and on his face. He's always sweaty Greasy hair dirty fingernails and Fair and well respected but about six years ago his wife and his daughter died from cholera And that pretty much is a redone. Yeah, he always Boils his water before he drinks it now. Does he have taste buds? He probably not because he smokes he smoked cigars. He smokes hand-rolled cigarettes He chews tobacco. He's known to make he's known to make tea with tobacco. Oh He uses that as a chaser for his whiskey He always keeps iced fully stocked bar with really nice whiskey But he he buys nice stuff so that people don't think he's a drunk Yeah, so people think he's classy but he is a drunk drinks heavily throughout the day always has a he's got a flask on him It's a metal flask like bound with leather and on on the flask. It says to EC from our EC with love Ruth Ruth Courtland was his wife So he keeps that it's very special to him always filled with whiskey Four times that big so it's like it can fit a hell of a lot of whiskey in it
2981.38 3023.78 speaker3  But because I was playing Taney Zuko in Grease at my high school's production, of course and I needed a flask got that lead as a sophomore baby, and so I Stealing nips from people's parents basements and such right, but I learned later when I used that flask It held half a fifth of shit. Yeah, that's
3017.98 3219.24 speaker2  375 milliliters, I'd say that's about yeah half a fifth is what this can can hold He always has it on him his clothes that he wears since he is a judge Usually like three-piece suits and stuff, but they have not been washed or taken care of The greasy plate is broken on the ground beside him missing the half pound of bacon It held the night before which was eaten far too quickly by the judge and washed down with a half a bottle of expensive whiskey His stomach churns out a low gurgle like the sound of that sweet black gold when it bubbles up from the earth Not help the cause as he rises up from the chair His top hat scrapes the roof of his modest home His 43 year old bones hold him up at 6 foot 10 and carries a little over 300 pounds of booze and pork filled fat The man looks like he's falling apart as if his skin was one paper cut away from expelling the rotten insides and decaying flesh he takes his top hat off and bends over holding the makeshift barf bag expectantly in front of him a Minute passes but the only bodily fluid in the hat is sweat that is profusely dripping off the man's balding head He tosses the hat to the ground and strips down naked He boils water for a bath buying some half-cooked bacon left on the dining table from the night before He decides against a hot bath. It's much too hot already He half-heartedly washes himself in a cool bath just enough to be almost presentable for court He comes as long graying patchy hair across his head and oils up his mustache He picks up an earthy tweed three-piece suit off the floor and dresses himself Bending over to put on his socks and shoes He feels dizzy his top hat finally fulfills its purpose as he empties his guts into his felt and silk wastebasket He straightens himself up feeling much better and removes a flask from his jacket He drains the flask in one goal that fills it with a half empty bottle from the night before He takes one last swig from the bottle switches it around his mouth Gargles and spits it into the top hat he tucks his flask back into his suit jacket and heads toward the door As he walks outside, he figures it to be around noon He was due at the courthouse at 9, but he knows he will be fine as he is the only judge for miles Plus the townsfolk won't get too upset if they can't pay their fine for not hitching their horse or getting unruly at the bar
3217.24 3281.36 speaker3  one of the gamblers disappeared and A couple of them got into a got a pretty unruly Unruly enough to where one of them was locked up at the courthouse and Courtland is walking through and this guy He's got mine face not mine Yeah, but he's kind of my main because his hands are up against the bars in front of him But there's actual bars there. So he's really good at miming, right? And he sticks his head in between two of the bars
3274.74 3292.52 speaker2  like the guys holding on to the bars of the prison cell and he just punches his fingers into the bar of the
3289.52 3300.84 speaker3  backs away into the darkness of his cell
3295.56 3361.82 speaker2  He kind of eyes the guy and just stops for a second and then continues walking back to the day in question How could a man like that own that horse? Ephraim Courtland mounts the horse effortlessly his grace opposite of everything else in his life He takes off at breakneck speed on his steed kicking up an enormous dust cloud as he races towards the courthouse As he rides, there are only two things on his mind his horse and how many men he wants to hang today
3355.58 3450.42 speaker3  When he walks in he goes to flip on the lights the new electrical system has made Electrical lighting possible here in the courthouse. Thanks to all Silas Cole the genius and contention and as you flip them on there's nothing Um, it's just that it seems to be that the the copper wiring has been stolen paralegal comes running up Requesting your presence at the town hall meeting at the church to discuss
