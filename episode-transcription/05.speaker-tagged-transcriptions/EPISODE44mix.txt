The two opened the door to Glass' office, unleashing a relentless surge of water that caught Keith up in its current before he was lifted out of the drink by Marvin Glass. crime family and he showed them a polaroid picture from the odd camera that depicts the which is made of light.
178.62 211.14 speaker0  The only thing keeping me steady is the repetition, baby, it is kudzu with no backbone.
210.14 227.86 speaker3  kitchen. Okay. We were talking about Ed Kemper and Luke said, how tall was he? Six foot nine. And he had an IQ? Of 145. And then you said that'd make him a really...
223.46 236.02 speaker2  He could have been a really good basketball player and probably taught at MIT.
233.18 302.74 speaker3  Oh, goodness. He should have just sacked up and kill fucked his mom earlier. So you're standing on water. Yeah. You probably got dragged by Marvin Glass, like physically, like up, up, like 40 meters up on top of the water and now you're standing there and he's just asked you what you know
298.42 314.14 speaker2  about this picture. agape. Okay.
312.54 429.42 speaker3  Some stuff happened before this. So Clark, Marvin pulled you down like the way that you moved last time. As soon as you made it to your final destination there, whip snapping into position, he immediately snapped and you just went unconscious and during that time when your eyes are open, you're just standing there, but nothing, nothing is seen from your end from behind your eyes and Marvin and Rosemary continued to discuss this picture and he's holding it up and he's It's not, there's something I, you got to send me over there. of all of a sudden Marvin perks up something in his lack of facial emotions, still twitches and he turns and looks up into the corner of the room up to where the elevator in the room next to his office, far above and far beyond the scale of this room, he sees the look on his face when this creature arrives in his palm, his long fingers wrapping around a softball sized fish head with a human body attached to it that is the size of like a Barbie doll.
428.42 531.54 speaker4  Oh gosh. I'm just so sorry. I don't know what happened last time that made, made you sure want to do that, but I, never seen anything like it of this short and there was some, uh, feelings inside. you know, the next great adventure for old me, you know, now that I'm, uh, finally out there, you know, you know, got friends now and I've, I've, here I am talking to like It's just very nice. Is that like, I can't even imagine doing anything of that short of nature. It's absolutely incredible. Thank you so much for this opportunity.
524.10 607.10 speaker3  I mean, and he looks over at Rosemary, who's just arms crossed, but Marvin's face once again takes a different shape and it's like he smells or feels some sort of sensation and immediately his hands move and out from the water come Keith Vigna and this scientist lady with the, uh, the white, you know, soaking wet lab coat and the, the hair maniacally And as soon as she sees Peter Dieter, she's extremely, extremely happy to see him. And Keith, you looking around this room, you're not standing on this water, like I said, and you see these odd people. I mean, the situation is very strange. You've got Rosemary in this room. You've got Marvin Glass next to her behind his desk. You're next to Clark Bishop who is just now seeing you and opening like his eyes to the world. And you also see in like Marvin Glass's hand or maybe on the desk now is Peter Dieter sitting down there.
601.62 620.54 speaker4  After the last time in our meeting, I thought, oh gosh, there's absolutely no way that he's going to make it much more than one episode.
615.74 665.94 speaker3  And Marvin reaches out and shuts down Peter Dieter. Peter Dieter just stares these wide eyes, these wide fish eyes and this tight lipped human mouth. And I need the both of you to roll a power check for me. Hmm. a second time what you know about this picture, you have to tell him like a compulsion inside of you.
664.94 675.86 speaker2  it. I mean, it's, it reminds me of the place that I was with Maggie, correct? Totally. Okay. Other than that, I don't know.
674.86 676.86 speaker3  Right.
675.86 680.86 speaker2  That's what I was going to say. Oh sure. That we know where these come from.
679.86 683.86 speaker0  Gotcha.
682.86 732.12 speaker2  I'll tell him, Oh, they're there. Um, it's that camera there. And I point at it cause it's sitting on the desk. There was one with all the people with the torches and the old timey, uh, clothing in front of blackness, like a black building.
730.52 756.00 speaker4  Say that again. A man with tribal tattoos? You also said the name John Peters.
752.72 773.44 speaker2  Yeah, that was, I think that was the first one, one of the first ones we took. And did, did he have fool branded on his forehead? And in all of them, that's, it's just like a black inky background.
768.20 945.56 speaker3  As you guys are having this conversation there, when, when you guys say that one of them has you see she is eyeing the gun so hard. And the way I typically use handouts is I hold them until you guys do something that would unlock the handout, right? In this instance, you have unlocked a cut scene. Okay. I don't play video games, but this is a, uh, I didn't mean to sound so assholeish when I said that. and go to school and produce this podcast. One day I'll play video games, but anyway, this is an audio cut scene of what happens next. Ooh, nice. Rosemary dives for the gun and as she grabs it, Marvin reaches down and flings the sphere Multiple shiny limbs extend from this small metal sphere and slam into the desk and the water below, giving it the leverage it needs to fling its silver round frame at its target, Rosemary. One of its appendages slices into the soft tissue on the back of Rosemary's neck. Mother snaps her head forward and you hear the fracture as a third metal tendril reaches in gripping the top of Rosemary's spine where it meets her head and it rips her entire spinal cord out of her body in one swift motion, promptly forcing itself into the now vacant spinal column of this human being. The new Rosemary standing before you has a crazed look in her eyes as she blows her nose into her hand, slams the mucus into the empty chamber of this weird gun, and squeezes the trigger on the odd looking revolver. There is an almost blinding flash of light that illuminates your entire field of vision and then, as if she had never been, the body of Rosemary is gone. I need you both to roll sanity for me.
944.56 972.16 speaker2  I don't want to play anymore. I don't want to play anymore. I quit. I rolled a hundred. What was this on? I rolled over my power with an eighty-two. All right.
970.72 984.00 speaker3  This is very fun indeed. Real fast. She shot the gun.
981.72 986.84 speaker2  So like where was the muzzle pointed when it went off?
985.84 1035.74 speaker3  So it just like... Just pulled the trigger. and when the PCs come across them or see them you write like roll sanity and then you write how many sanity you take and a lot of them are zero slash one which means if you pass you take zero sanity damage, if you fail you take one sanity damage, right? Do you have a d3? No, you're right. I was about to roll a d4.
1034.74 1037.74 speaker2  Oh wait, yeah.
1036.74 1040.54 speaker3  You can roll a d4 if you want. It's like triangle, three.
1038.74 1045.34 speaker2  You can roll a d4.
1041.54 1064.26 speaker3  Okay, so that's two plus four is six so you lose six sanity. What am I gonna do? You automatically take the highest amount of sanity damage so you're gonna take seven sanity loss.
1061.82 1081.30 speaker2  That puts Clark at sanity seven. He still has a breaking point at six. Oh shit.
1075.38 1148.34 speaker3  So, Luke, at negative one sanity, you really can't go negative, it's just zero. So typically in Delta Green you would lose complete control of your character, however I trust in you to be able to play a fully insane PC that I'm gonna let you hold onto that character and do whatever you want with him as he completely loses his fucking mind. when we can just make this one fucking nuts. So you're gonna roll a negative 20 on everything and you are going to automatically fail sanity Yeah, basically, because everything is real, everything is good to you, whatever. And you also have that thing that happens when you roll sanity over your power. Yeah. Give me one moment.
1147.34 1152.98 speaker2  I gotta look up what that is again.
1148.34 1164.66 speaker3  Joe, just take off your headphones real quick and plug them ears. So it's that you get extremely paranoid. Okay, yeah.
1159.02 1167.66 speaker2  Do you also want me to constantly be thinking, well, because I already think that I'm possessed by a demon. Oh, yeah.
1166.66 1234.48 speaker3  You're going to constantly. That's going to be a big part of it. Uh-huh. So here we are. As soon as that happens, the light flashes and you- His Marvin Glass loses his fucking mind and then he reaches out and he holds on to everyone. You cannot move a muscle and then you feel as he kind of waggles his lack of eyebrows, you feel your jaws begin to unclench and your tongues begin to become loose and he rolls
1225.64 1241.72 speaker2  I saw that gun one time before and it did the flash thing. I don't know.
1236.48 1338.52 speaker3  You both failed your sanity checks and so you see the ground above the water where Rose down there and seemingly inside all this muck is the placid body of Rose Mary. She is lying peacefully as her limbs seem to fold into this ooze, becoming one with the sentient mass of goop that is now sliding across the water and Marvin Glass reaches out at one of his hands and grabs it and flings it downward into the water below and you hear this noise that you have yet to hear. It's basically like, you know, like there's a certain kind of kitchen top, like a stove top kind of thing that when you turn it on, if it's like kind of broken, the noise that it makes gets inside of your head. You can feel it a little bit in your throat and like inside of your body. Do you guys have that ever? It was just this frequency that would break me as a person.
1337.02 1348.80 speaker2  I can imagine that. Is that what you're talking about? Yes, absolutely.
1347.80 1354.32 speaker3  Yeah, I feel you.
1353.32 1357.08 speaker2  You can kind of feel.
1354.80 1368.80 speaker3  I can feel it in my throat right now as we're talking. Makes me sick.
1366.40 1386.00 speaker2  No, he threw the tube.
1385.00 1408.28 speaker4  What about that? Have you seen that before?
1403.84 1433.12 speaker2  when it decimated two people. I saw it once before. It was seeping out of a picture one time. One that came out of the camera. One of the Polaroids. I saw it once then. I saw it then as well.
1430.08 1446.48 speaker4  Did it take people when you saw it? Do you know how to contain it or is it running rampant through your city?
1444.80 1466.16 speaker2  We know that it takes people. I don't know that I've exactly seen it firsthand. Maybe I have. There was one time that me and John ran into it and there was a guy who was using a vacuum
1464.12 1471.32 speaker4  Who was this man?
1470.32 1522.12 speaker2  Just James. He worked at the mill. Am I still under the influence of power? It's a one. A zero zero. Oh!
1516.08 1540.60 speaker3  You can tell him whatever you want and he is very, very convinced that you are telling him the truth.
1535.00 1542.60 speaker2  All I know is what I just saw and what I saw in those videotapes.
1541.60 1555.44 speaker3  Oh, actually, just kidding. You just tell him. You're so fucked up right now. Yeah, you just immediately tell him.
1552.44 1569.84 speaker2  Yeah, what videotape?
1568.04 1582.32 speaker3  He had never seen it.
1574.96 1622.40 speaker2  Anytime somebody touches one of those metal balls, it does what it just did to her and they've got a room covered in blood and there were lots of videotapes. I just saw one of them, but I assume that's what happens every time. That's what she told me every time and I told her, I told her what we did with the silver We had a bag.
1621.40 1629.20 speaker4  There's nothing? Just like out of nowhere?
1626.40 1634.56 speaker3  The little fish fella says from the desk. Yeah, Peter.
1633.08 1641.96 speaker4  That's so cool. You could just make anything disappear out of nowhere.
1637.80 1682.08 speaker2  I don't know if we tried it with anything else, but those metal balls disappeared. Yeah. One was in that woman's head, that disgusting body's head that I think maybe, I think maybe
1671.32 1693.24 speaker4  He said earlier that they took one of them spears out of this lady's head and that one Is that true? Did your fellow officer hold this spear?
1692.24 1698.24 speaker2  Clark nods. Yes. Yes. I saw it.
1697.24 1699.24 speaker4  Where is he now?
1698.24 1703.10 speaker2  You don't know?
1700.92 1713.24 speaker4  Oh, that's right. He died. He was gunned down and ripped apart.
1712.24 1721.88 speaker2  Kinda.
1716.08 1741.00 speaker4  Now tell me, why was Kevin in this picture with you?
1739.22 1761.42 speaker3  So does Clark's.
1757.30 1772.54 speaker4  that he grabbed the metal sphere.
1768.62 1787.54 speaker2  in the water beneath us, do I see Kevin's body anywhere?
1779.30 1833.70 speaker3  And all of a sudden out of nowhere, the wet dead body of Kevin is in his hand in front of you. And as he pulls the head of John Lee Kevin Moore apart, sitting inside like the pit in a perfect avocado, you see a small metal sphere.
1832.26 1836.98 speaker2  Is his brain in there?
1834.78 1837.98 speaker3  It was like split in half as well.
1836.98 1839.98 speaker2  Yeah. And the sphere was like embedded.
1838.98 1865.26 speaker3  Embedded in it. Was there a spine? Marvin Glass turns it over to one side so that he can hold the ball like steady with half the skull and then he peels down and just rips the body in half completely dropping the other half into the water and you see where a spinal cord should be, there is nothing there.
1862.58 1887.42 speaker2  Zach, if you don't fucking stop, I'm quitting. Keith is racking his brain since the cage fight. All the interactions I'd had with Kevin, trying to think of any, I lose no sanity because I don't have any.
1886.42 1920.62 speaker4  Okay. Well, with this new information, I have a plan for the future. The two of you are on your way to give some heavy entertainment. So if I could answer any questions you may have on your way below ground, meaning death,
1919.62 1933.14 speaker2  What are those? What are those balls? What are they?
1923.74 2051.50 speaker4  Well, as you know, I've been doing research and I have come to very few conclusions, but One was brought to me a long time ago by two men that I was seeking out that along with one other person stole something from me, but I got them. I got them all right. And one of them stuck around as my loyal bodyguard for many years, but he brought me my first That was Kevin. He perished in my need to gain knowledge. and become malleable.
2048.14 2091.22 speaker2  You slung that silver sphere at Rosemary when she went for the gun. So you knew it did a thing. But then she still shot the gun. It didn't work. Is that what you're saying? It didn't do what you thought it was gonna?
2087.38 2155.42 speaker4  That is Jermaine Glass. Cool. He seems to be wherever it is that this camera and perhaps this gun are connected to. Have you any more information about this place, this other world?
2152.10 2159.96 speaker3  What do you know about the world that these take place in? What do you know about this other place?
2158.96 2165.80 speaker2  We don't know much. There's two other things like those.
2162.38 2174.82 speaker3  There's a radio and there's a helmet.
2169.42 2199.42 speaker2  The inky darkness around every figure we've seen reminded us of the goo, but we didn't know what that meant. We had somebody take a look at that one that had a bunch of people in front of a thing and apparently all the clothing was kind of mismatched as far as time periods go. We don't know.
2190.46 2207.14 speaker4  You've never seen another place that has the dark sky and the ground that is made of light
2204.62 2211.36 speaker2  The old photos, we didn't see the ground of light, did we? I think maybe no.
2210.36 2214.10 speaker3  Yeah. I think you've just seen it once.
2212.36 2277.50 speaker2  It was just in this particular picture of us. I've seen that place. I've seen where we stand. But I didn't... Go on, boy. I didn't... We weren't all there and I don't even know if I was there myself. It just was. I saw it. I've seen a place that looks like that before, yes. I saw something in it. There was a creature in that world there and there were people who were trying to keep it at bay and it scared me so bad that I... That's all I know. Why do you want to destroy these?
2275.14 2388.30 speaker4  Use, destroy. Power is my competition and greed is the contest and I will not stop until I have attained control over this domain. Last one. We are in control and we run things. However, from the bureaucratic standpoint, I was getting bored and ready to go out on my own. not take orders kindly and I left them a while ago.
2386.34 2399.62 speaker0  Holy shit.
2392.74 2425.68 speaker3  The metal walls on either side of you are covered in every type of weapon, armor, gadget and contraption imaginable. The wall in front of you has a doorway with a set of steps leading up. What? Are we both there?
2424.68 2472.16 speaker2  And each other. Do I? I search myself. You have it. Okay. Are you looking for this? And I hold up the tiny powerful gun?
2464.60 2484.96 speaker3  It's the cage that you've been in before and inside this cage is a man so massive that he barely fits and his muscles bulge and press against the inside of his cage and Oz Mayhem Wolf squeezes himself out and into this room.
2483.40 2487.96 speaker4  I see that we are.
2485.96 2490.92 speaker3  I was just in Marvin. I was inside him.
2489.92 2507.26 speaker4  Hello everyone. Yes. Here's where I am.
2501.82 2524.18 speaker3  He runs excitedly to go grab his stuff and he grabs a pair of boots and some shoulder pads a football helmet and a pair of gloves and he he's all jazzed up and he's putting on all this stuff and he heads over to the stairwell excitedly.
2523.18 2544.94 speaker2  something else together? I don't what's going on?
2542.86 2569.46 speaker3  you need to start grabbing stuff. Okay. You can have pretty much fucking anything.
2565.86 2580.98 speaker2  Is there any chance that Oz looks back and says what we're going to be fighting?
2576.02 2620.98 speaker3  opens up in the ceiling above you at the top of the stairs as you guys all grab everything that you brought with you and head up the stairs and a disorienting amount of light and sound pours in and you hear violently chanted by an unseen crowd.
2616.46 2642.14 speaker2  when we woke up in this room did we feel anything in what way if we lost consciousness
2635.54 2771.86 speaker3  of immediate sleep like you just became in this other place you just came all over it that way you can keep secrets from each other and stuff however the next episode is going to be by various electronics and machines we see a massive shiny metal sphere 20 feet tall with silvery arms extending from either side a tube connects this gargantuan ball to a machine below the machine begins whirring and we see a small metal sphere roughly one inch in diameter begin moving up through the tubing into the larger armed version of itself as this happens you body this colossal monument to destruction a vast circle opens up in the ceiling above you and it's disorienting amount of light and sound pours into this dark room revealing text painted on the back wall that says the same thing you hear violently chanted by an unseen crowd you
