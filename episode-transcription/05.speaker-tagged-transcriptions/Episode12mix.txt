0.00 233.30 speaker0  Howdy my cowpups, it's your radio sheriff, Wolf the dog, and I'm wrangling up all of contention's juicy news from 694.2 PTBP. First up, a word with some friends on howlin' with Wolf. Your wolf brother Lord Morty wants to give a shoutout to all his dogs over at the discord server for the good friends of Jackson Elias. If you pups aren't part of the pack already, it's a place where you can yip, yap, wolf, or whimper about Call of Cthulhu, horror films, or horror gaming in general. Just dig out your doggy device, download the discord app, and search for the good friends of Jackson Elias. Keep those claws sharp and those canines sharper, see you wolf pups around. Now while this is a note from the producer, the good friends of Jackson Elias have been an integral part of this keeper's horror and roleplay education, if you're willing to lose some sanity along the way. And Scott Dorward, one of the good friends, was even kind enough to reply to this producer's reddit post regarding running his outstanding scenario, Hell in Texas, found in Stygian Fox's reality-breaking book, The Things We Leave Behind. If y'all want your best friend Wolf to read something you got to say, leave us a sweet five star review or tag us in a social media thing, y'all know the drill. And now we got a little news on the wire. Last I heard, Officer Vigna and the two other idiots busted into the deceased child's room at Hotel Motel, guns drawn, and sans warrant. There they found a woman dressed similarly to her favorite TV character, the Fonz. But let me tell y'all, these were not happy days as she whipped a knife out at Officer Vigna after these so-called peacekeepers pulled the guns out. Guns are scary, y'all. The party had Greece and Professor Trelawney pinned down until the brilliant Keith Vigna engaged her in hand-to-hand combat, resulting in a hostage situation for the copper. Vigna, an officer of the law, proceeded to brag about killing a coworker. But I heard the sweet-talkin' officer bishop managed to keep her from killin' him there on the spot. And now when that old wired lady made a run for it over the railin' and ran into the parking lot, all three of those officers unloaded their weapons from the second floor corridor, bringin' her down before she could get into her vehicle. The officers patched her up and sent her to the city hospital with Lauren, the only decent officer left in contention. The scene was so dramatic for everyone stayin' at Hotel Motel, owners say they will likely have to shut down soon due to the negative reviews on Yelp. The officers are plannin' a sting operation to catch Billy Harrison, the stranger runnin' about contention in an official police uniform. What? Wait a minute. Well, if we only get to listen to one song before some bald dude dressed as a cock comes and we all get got, let it be kudzu with no backbone. Hey Drew!
232.30 281.86 speaker1  hole. A very short, young woman and a very tall, old man get out and they are both wearing a black suit, white shirt, black tie, black sunglasses, and an ill-fitting windbreaker that says FBI in big letters across the back. Clark, as you sip on your coffee, you hear the door behind you swing open. The door chimes jingle and jangle and you hear footsteps. Out of the corner of your eye, you see a short, young woman walk across the shop to the counter. The other footsteps approach you from behind. You're all in plainclothes and I think at this point you were texting information.
279.22 299.30 speaker2  like two FBI agents just walked in. Send. Hey baby. Some female body inspectors just walked in. One was approaching me.
297.34 303.78 speaker1  Someone is clearly like standing behind you. I think you had your newspaper up.
302.78 307.94 speaker2  Yep. Okay. I turn around and look up at them.
305.78 343.58 speaker1  It's this, uh, older dude. He's quite tall and he's pretty gruff looking and he just stares back down at you and his eyes are empty. woman at the counter, she orders something from the guy behind the counter there. What's his name? Right? The donut hole.
342.58 356.74 speaker2  Duncan Hole.
347.58 371.58 speaker1  He, uh, pours her a coffee and she walks and sits at the booth with Clark Bishop across from you.
370.42 390.34 speaker2  Are you looking for John? Are you not John? Uh, John what? John Peters. Hmm. I've heard that name before.
386.26 401.38 speaker1  The man behind you, he puts a hand on your shoulder.
397.98 413.30 speaker2  I don't, I don't know where John Peters is. Who are you? Uh, my name's Clark. Clark what? Clark Bishop. Clark Bishop. What do you do? Uh, I actually happen to be a officer here in this town. Oh, of course.
412.30 437.54 speaker1  Of course. You're officer Bishop. Oh, that's right. Um, where's John Peters then? You should know.
431.62 444.30 speaker2  Me and my, uh, my fellow officers, this is kind of a, we're curious about John too. We're working on it though.
443.30 452.70 speaker1  What kind of bag? It's a black Nike bag. It was in a storage unit here in contention and we're looking for it. Huh.
451.70 456.34 speaker2  Nothing. Well, we'll keep an eye out for it.
454.34 468.26 speaker1  That's for dang sure. Okay, well. Hey, off character, off conversation, did we find that in the storage locker?
467.26 471.38 speaker2  What was in it?
469.58 475.02 speaker1  There's literally a Nike bag. Oh shit. Is that in the-
473.78 480.10 speaker2  Is there something horrifying in it?
476.02 487.78 speaker1  I think Clark opened it and he's asked what was inside and I told him there's nothing There's nothing in there.
485.10 489.78 speaker2  Is there anything in the leather backpack? Is it at the prison?
488.78 495.58 speaker1  At the jail?
493.86 499.82 speaker2  other stuff.
497.54 532.98 speaker1  You know, I think that's above your pay grade. Oh, is it? Oh, definitely. John Peters had the keys for those storage units. We went by those storage units. They're empty. Hmm. Uh, alertness. Uh, 87. What are you listening to?
531.98 541.46 speaker2  Natch. Niberia. I'm just failing to understand how a guy from my town missing an empty bag is above my pay grade.
540.46 542.46 speaker1  I'm trying to help.
541.46 559.98 speaker2  Okay.
556.42 589.98 speaker1  us out with some information about some things that are happening in this town. You see, we know about the body in the junkyard and we know about the chopped up body in the plastic trunk with the woman's head that was split open. We're also pretty sure that you killed a man named Charles earlier this evening. And I believe you also shot a woman at hotel motel earlier tonight. So I think maybe officer Bishop, you're not in much of a place to say what should be done next. Oh boy. In character. No, for real.
588.98 592.98 speaker2  Just like, uh-uh. No, no you.
590.98 606.56 speaker3  You didn't, how'd you hear about that?
603.86 624.34 speaker1  We talked to them and they won't be talking anymore. County won't be talking? We didn't kill them. No, we just, there are certain things that need to be kept away from the knowledge of the people. That's one of them. Clark, Bishop, they told you about the difference between the age of the inside and the age of the outside of the corpse from the junkyard, did they not? Yeah, about that lab fuckup?
622.98 634.02 speaker2  That's a big oopsie on their part. Yeah, they're clearly not very good at their jobs.
630.46 673.18 speaker1  Do you know anything about this black Nike bag that we look for? Because we're not leaving this town until we find it? Agent, uh... He's still holding your shoulder. What does this guy look like? I'm imagining like a- Well, the woman that's talking is really young and really short and she's just kind of like bright eyed, bushy tail, weird voice. Like a squirrel. Like a Scottish squirrel or Canadian, whatever she, whatever accent she's got.
672.18 711.02 speaker2  A Scottish Canadian girl? Where the fuck is she from? weird. The reason I wasn't totally forthcoming with you is I don't know exactly what the hell's going on. over our heads at this point.
708.46 714.94 speaker1  And she says, are we keeping you from something more important?
713.74 771.46 speaker2  That's kind of what this all was. That's why I'm not wearing my uniform right now. Yeah. You walked in with the FBI thing on your jacket, which kind of fucked all that up. I guess the plan kind of worked. I suppose in a way. Who are you looking for? And so we were trying to catch him. We were trying to get him back here. I'm not proud of everything that's happened tonight.
767.86 774.70 speaker1  You guys really seem to have the top on this whole situation, don't you?
773.70 782.70 speaker2  We were on it. Well, sorry. That's okay.
781.70 789.70 speaker3  Ding. Oh boy.
786.70 830.10 speaker2  Give me a hit of that vape while we're at it. You guys want to hear that annoying sound? of a loss. I don't know where I stand with these guys at fucking all because I think we're past the point of like lying to them.
825.70 835.10 speaker1  Clark is in like a, Oh, cause he's like wants to help out, but he's like, uh, I will go to jail for sure.
831.10 845.42 speaker2  He was a good cop 24 hours ago, whatever it was.
841.62 853.58 speaker1  It's like 1am on December 4th, the morning of December 4th now.
852.58 876.38 speaker2  What are we, the FBI? Are you, uh, you folks, uh, you guys in town for a while? so far tomorrow at the station.
875.38 890.58 speaker1  Yes. Stop apologizing. Your hands are touched by God.
889.22 914.62 speaker2  Like I'm winning every time.
908.54 942.66 speaker1  We'll see you bright and early at 10 o'clock and agent McKinley and agent Kennedy walk out of the donut hole. Which one was Kennedy? Kennedy was the female woman from agent Kennedy was the short one, the young woman from the Oh, sure. Where do you think she was born? What abouts? God. Who knows?
937.58 956.82 speaker2  It's CPD oil, like contention, police department. That's not a very good one.
955.82 979.88 speaker3  That's let's in an episode right there.
974.14 986.80 speaker2  As soon as those two leave, I'm furiously texting those guys or you guys furiously. The FBI is here. They talked to me. We got to get together.
985.80 998.04 speaker3  Come to the car. I send back. to the car, but I'm still a little like, wow, I could have waited for him.
997.02 1006.08 speaker1  You guys hop in the car.
1004.32 1017.86 speaker2  all this crazy shit that's been happening. Do they know that we have the stuff in the storage units? know that we do.
1016.86 1019.86 speaker3  Okay.
1018.86 1070.90 speaker2  Okay. So we should get back to the PD and... So they're going to come by tomorrow morning at 10 and I told them we cooperate. No. that we killed Charles. They knew... Yeah, but all the murders, I mean, all the things we had to do, we had to do on official police business. Of course. And we would explain that to them. I'm just saying that they're aware of us potentially being off the deep end.
1069.54 1072.90 speaker1  Did they know what else was in the unit?
1071.90 1093.64 speaker2  Yeah. They're looking for a black Nike bag. So they know that the storage units were cleared out and they knew that John was supposed to have the keys to them.
1092.64 1094.64 speaker3  it over.
1093.64 1098.74 speaker2  You know what I mean?
1097.74 1102.50 speaker1  else. Cause I'm not looking to go to jail for...
1101.18 1110.66 speaker3  We found it somewhere. Maybe we went and poked around John Peter's house again and there it was. Who knows? I'm just saying... Let's lie.
1109.66 1117.58 speaker2  Cause I don't want to go to jail. Give up all that cocaine. Yeah. But where can we put it?
1113.94 1140.22 speaker3  Back in the storage units? Let's go back to the PD and figure out what we're going to do from there. Okay, let's all go back to the police department and... It's right across the street. We can see it.
1138.22 1149.74 speaker2  We're back.
1148.74 1156.34 speaker1  Not Drew. Drew is not at the police department.
1152.74 1170.50 speaker3  Well, we need to change that because somebody's going to have to move all this stuff. It's late. It's not going to be us. When's the last time you didn't see Drew when you were here? What do we see?
1163.50 1201.14 speaker1  There is just a note on Drew's desk and it says, went to the chief's house, we'll be Yep. Okay. And as you guys walk in, Dr. Marie Jacobs stirs from her cell in the back and she's We are. We happen to be officer-ing. Shh, you'll wake him. And Salem is like asleep on her, on her lap.
1199.16 1225.48 speaker3  It's your shrill ass who's going to wake him. you walk in? to find all that shit. Right. Oh yeah.
1224.48 1230.56 speaker1  Yeah. It would be five steps into the back room and you'd be like, Oh, there's a lot of stuff
1229.56 1235.78 speaker3  Okay.
1231.56 1247.02 speaker1  I'm imagining that each cell is individually barred from the front. However, they are separated in an opaque fashion from cell to cell.
1246.02 1253.26 speaker2  some dry wall around.
1252.26 1266.26 speaker3  Let's call Drew.
1264.78 1268.26 speaker1  Give a message after the beep.
1267.26 1275.90 speaker3  Bye. Click. I don't leave fucking voicemails. Okay.
1274.26 1278.46 speaker2  I think priority number one is get our goodies somewhere else.
1277.46 1280.46 speaker3  At your house.
1279.46 1292.34 speaker2  Yeah. Uh, you live the farthest out of town, don't you? Okay. Let's put them at your house. We could nimby it up. I'll just take a little bit of home.
1290.06 1309.42 speaker3  I live at a motel right now. And there's a scene of the crime a few doors down for me. Maybe not. Maybe not in my room. You guys could split it up.
1308.42 1315.86 speaker2  That all does sound good to me. It's just that realistically that's a, we have, there's so much shit in those storage lockers. Like we just kind of montage this.
1314.58 1319.46 speaker3  I've already got the cocaine. I'll see you later.
1316.86 1322.42 speaker2  We probably still have the U-Haul, right? Yeah.
1320.46 1324.54 speaker3  The police U-Haul.
1322.42 1345.66 speaker1  You've got some sort of police U-Haul. Box trucks. Can we just montage that real quick? So it's at least 1.30 now. Maybe two. So I'm going to have you guys all lose another willpower point if you're going to keep going. I'm at nine.
1344.38 1360.02 speaker3  So how long is this going to take us to do? We can regain them by sleeping and stuff, right? Yeah, I'm not heading back to the police department.
1357.14 1366.50 speaker1  A full night's sleep gives you 1D6 willpower.
1363.22 1388.70 speaker3  How about we meet back up at like an hour before they get here? Yeah, let's get here at eight. That way we have a couple hours to talk about what the hell we're going to do. Okay guys, we're going to get to work on time and then... Plan. Plot. I think we're plotting. This is fine. Yeah.
1385.90 1397.18 speaker1  rundown of where everything is going.
1393.54 1400.46 speaker3  check up on Drew at the chief's house, especially since he doesn't call us back.
1397.18 1418.42 speaker2  If you guys are taking this stuff to your house, I can go to the chief's house.
1417.42 1429.46 speaker3  your houses. Good night, Keith. Good luck, man. Oh, I don't need it.
1427.50 1437.38 speaker1  what to your respective homes?
1431.50 1446.18 speaker2  I want to take all of the important documents we found and I'll take some of the guns or all the guns either way.
1442.62 1451.82 speaker3  We wouldn't want a man like you wanted up, caught with all that cocaine. You know, the Pennymores, I can just say it was left on the property, you know what I mean?
1450.82 1453.82 speaker2  Yeah. Yeah.
1452.82 1455.82 speaker3  Thanks for doing that for me, John.
1454.82 1459.82 speaker2  I got your back, brother. I don't want to get penalized for forgetting what all- Absolutely. You won't be.
1458.82 1464.34 speaker3  We'll take everything, yeah.
1461.14 1466.34 speaker2  We'll take everything unless there's something that you would think that we should talk about
1465.34 1469.34 speaker3  Yeah.
1468.34 1473.38 speaker1  John takes half the guns and all the cocaine.
1471.22 1513.38 speaker3  The question is what's in everything else? Is the cursed turtle we found going to explode or something that we forgot about? That way I can be like, you can act like you had no idea about it. Yeah, let's look at the bag.
1510.46 1521.38 speaker1  It's a drawstring bag like you would take to the gym. It has a Nike swish on it and it says Nike on it. Nothing inside. Nick.
1520.38 1528.78 speaker2  Is there anything in the office that I can run over? I'm sure we do. I'm sure we have a wand of some kind.
1527.78 1535.98 speaker1  In the bag. There's a metal in the bag. If you swipe it over the top of it, there's a lot of metal in the bag.
1534.58 1543.18 speaker2  So when I look into it though, it's empty?
1541.78 1547.18 speaker3  Maybe you can catch the goo with it. Maybe. We can talk about it more in the morning.
1545.18 1565.34 speaker2  I cast ritual detect magic.
1562.58 1584.58 speaker3  We all watch Clark do that.
1583.26 1593.66 speaker1  Something's up with this bag. Yeah, what's up with that?
1590.46 1600.38 speaker2  That's kind of what I'm getting at is that maybe if we hand it over, they'll tell us what it is. I like that idea.
1598.74 1620.62 speaker3  Yeah, they seem like they know. Like maybe they're right. Maybe this is above our pay grade. Nobody would do that.
1617.74 1622.62 speaker2  source and maybe, yeah, that they solve some shit for us. Yeah.
1621.62 1650.86 speaker3  Well, I mean, let's do it. We've made awful decisions up to this point. Keith, you're right. We've all made pretty awful choices and yeah, if we can like present this as a token of our good will to these people, throw them a bone. Maybe they take this whole fucking mess off our shoulders. I like it. Hey, did, do you know who's this is? Somebody left it or how should I present it?
1649.86 1653.86 speaker2  Okay.
1652.86 1659.34 speaker1  I just, it's just been in my cruiser.
1656.58 1664.02 speaker3  So I'm going to head off to Maggie's house.
1660.34 1713.96 speaker1  And the other two of you are going and taking the stuff to your respective homes. All right. If I could have the two of you leave this room now. I'm trying to think of when I had you lose another, go ahead and lose another willpower point for me. Okay. Yeah. You pull up. It is a nice old brick house in the style of ranch. There's one door in the front. There's like a big window in front of the patio that is out front. It's one story. Pretty nice place. But the chief's cruiser is actually parked in the driveway, which as you know, it hasn't been since she left on the night of December 1st. Oh yeah. I was going to ask, what does Drew drive?
1712.96 1718.72 speaker3  What does Drew drive?
1717.72 1816.60 speaker1  Yes. Yes. That is precisely correct. He drives a very clean mini Cooper and it is red with a black stripe. So that is out front as well. What would you like to do? I don't want to pull into the driveway. As you knock on the door, the door swings open. It wasn't closed completely. And as it opens, it stops short. You kind of look around the corner and you see there are two unconscious men on the ground. Are the lights on? The lights are not on, but these two unconscious men, one of them is Drew Andrews and it smells like poop. If I flip the switch, do the lights come on? to the foyer, Chief Maggie Cook's body in full uniform leans slumped against the wall on the other side of the room. A large chef's knife rests in her left hand. Her face has been stabbed repeatedly and her left foot is missing. Blood was clearly flowing rapidly from there. And as you push your way further into the room, it smells like gasoline and natural gas in here. What do you want to do?
1812.60 1826.76 speaker3  If I look at that other body, is it Maggie Cook's dad or can I identify the other male body?
1824.90 1919.06 speaker1  no hair and no chin. Is he alive or dead? They're both alive. Okay. As you walk into the kitchen, you see an unkempt man at the table hunched over with a fork in one hand and a pistol in the other. A bullet hole in his head has left him face down in a plate of meat. His left foot is also missing. It smells like natural gas, like crazy in here, as well as gasoline, which makes sense because there are gas cans sitting all over the place and gas has clearly been poured on everything. The range has a skillet on it with the leftovers of two feet that have had the meat pulled from them. All four burners are turned all the way up and as you go to turn the burners off, I need you to roll sanity for what you just saw. 87 on a 39. So go ahead and roll a, we're gonna do a D6 plus two. That's four plus two is six. Puts you down at 33. The breaking point of 30, correct, rapidly approaching.
1918.06 1938.20 speaker3  Is that right? Yep. So you're losing your fucking mind.
1931.54 1965.18 speaker1  and your left hand, your left hand hits a wire and you know immediately what you've done because you hear a click off to the side of the room at the front door, the entrance. You see a trap has clearly been set and you just fell right into it. A fire starts right at the front door and there's clearly a gasoline lead path that
1964.18 1967.18 speaker2  What do you do?
1966.18 2002.94 speaker3  Yep. I look up, I'm looking at the stove. Yep. There's a fire extinguisher there, right? Yeah. And then I grab it, stand up and start fire extinguishing at the flames while I'm running out the door. part of the fire to me and try to do that all along and then get out of there cause I don't want to fucking blow up. Yeah. That sounds good.
2001.94 2079.56 speaker1  I'm just kidding. Uh, do you have a skill that would help you in this endeavor? Quick little average of those 55. Yeah. So roll against that 55 71. Okay. Awesome. Try Joe's. His seemed to be working really well. Well, I already rolled that. are trying to wildly spray this, this fire extinguisher at the fire and then get out of there. So as you are running out, you have to jump over the two unconscious men. So as you are jumping over them to leave this house that is going to explode, what do you That is a success. Yay. Finally.
2074.32 2121.24 speaker3  I get up, I'm spraying the fire extinguisher all over in that room and on the trail of gasoline. I jump over and I'm spraying the fire and I realized who I just jumped over. I look at both the unconscious guys on the ground, realize I don't know who that other guy is, but I know that this is Drew and as much shit as we give Drew, we need him. And I put my arms underneath his armpits and just pull as hard as I can until I get out
2114.80 2306.44 speaker1  You guys go flying into the yard and smoke immediately starts billowing and you can hear the ringing of your ears underscored by the wood that was once the chief's house. childhood home. It's your birthday and your friends are standing around this table waiting for you to blow out the candles on your cake. You look up and you see your parents in the corner talking to your little brother. You squeeze your eyes tightly as you blow out your candles and as you do, you see that black shiny viscous sludge. Inside this muck are two thrashing bodies. Their hands reach out trying to escape this thing that has trapped them, but the struggle does not last long. Their limbs seem to fold into this ooze, becoming one with the sentient mass of goop that is now sliding across the ground toward you, opening your eyes. You see all of your peers around your childhood kitchen table laughing at you. The candles are still lit. You look up and your parents are poorly attempting to hold back laughter. You look at the cake and it is gone. You have a plate that is clean and you look around and see everyone else is eating a piece of cake. They are all laughing and begin to chant while pointing at you. Beans, beans, Keith, beans, his only friends are figurines. Yeah, you should. You run to follow them, but looking ahead, you only see that woman dressed in old-timey clothing. Sitting down, you fall into a black hole in the ground and you're standing in a cold, dark room. The lights begin to flicker on and you see massive tanks the size of grain silos standing right before you is yourself. You walk up to you. The face of the other you begins to age rapidly and then just as rapidly ages in reverse. You walk up to one of the massive tanks in this massive, dank, dimly lit room. You press your face against it to see its contents and something creeps toward you. And as it is about to come into focus, you wake up to the sound of sirens, their firefighters
2305.24 2311.98 speaker2  Did you pass a roll with those dice?

2503.34 2534.60 speaker3  Who did that, Keith? I don't know. Is she alive? No. Her and the other two died. I slap Keith a couple times. That was the unconscious guy and then I don't know who the other two.

2535.60 2553.00 speaker3  Hey, can we reload a quick save and instead of doing any of that sting shit, go check on the chief's house? I need to sit, lay down.

2715.92 2721.00 speaker2  How did you get out of there? You said Keith saved you. What, what happened?
2718.92 2736.04 speaker1  They said Keith pulled when they got here. I was on top of Keith in the front yard. I think he pulled me out as the house exploded.
