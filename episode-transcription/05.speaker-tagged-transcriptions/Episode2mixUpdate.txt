0.00 92.32 speaker0  Salutations, my babies. You are listening to 694.2 PTBP, Contingent's best and only radio show. Now, Wolf got a little bit of news for y'all today. Now, I heard through the grapevine that Officer Keith Vigna didn't get the chief a birthday present. Now, that's some cold shit. She did, however, receive a box with a single rose, a white hard hat, and a black silk bow tie before leaving town. And Julia Maxwell crashed her car driving drunk and was pronounced dead at the city hospital. Now, ain't that some shit for you? A body was found at the piston junkyard. The body has a brand on the back reading, This is a fool. That's some spooky stuff, y'all. That's just some spooky stuff. Now, we got a new jam for y'all today. It's Kudzu with No Backbone.
87.60 118.72 speaker2  balding and letting himself go. He's a hard worker and does his best, but it's often not enough. He pretends to know what he's doing. Often he doesn't, though. He's gotten pretty good at faking it. Clark is from contention, and he knows the town pretty dang well. He's a lonely guy who gets home from work, heats up his TV dinner, and watches Wheel of Fortune. And then he goes to bed and dreams about being a noir-style detective.
115.60 168.64 speaker1  where she is called in last night that her dog is missing. Councilwoman Carrie Pages. She is regarded highly in the community. You know of her, you probably don't know her very well. She's got a night to play. She's in the old neighborhood. It's where all these old houses are lined up. They've all been taken care of really well. These houses have been passed down from family to family. They're like rarely bought and sold in this neighborhood. What do you want to do when you arrive at her house? and is wearing a bejeweled pantsuit. No shit. It is lightly bejeweled, but any bejeweling of a pantsuit is immediately noticeable.
168.08 172.96 speaker2  Miss Page.
172.24 247.76 speaker1  Tyler, do you have a... Every morning he goes out and he typically just uses the restroom and comes right back inside before I feed him his breakfast, before I leave for the day. But today he did not come inside. And, you know, I saw some... There was something... Last night in the backyard, I thought I saw something moving, but, you know, there's this rash of homeless people. Are you doing anything about that? There seems to be more homeless in the community these days. And I just think... I'm very worried about Tyler. He's got a lot of meat on his bones. And if the homeless people are looking for something... But I'm not trying to say that homeless people... Oh, no, man. perhaps he is a good-looking eating dog. He's a good dog to eat. And he goes out the backyard and he comes right back in, because he loves his home and he loves his food.
245.28 253.92 speaker2  Have you put up pictures yourself already?
250.96 262.64 speaker1  And I have not seen him since about 5 a.m. It is 9 o'clock now and I'm late. And I would really appreciate you to find my dog.
262.08 269.04 speaker2  Go for it.
265.76 279.36 speaker1  She's got a little back deck set up. She's got a little grill out there. Lawn chairs and such. Big grassy area for the dog. 8-foot privacy fences all the way around.
278.88 284.96 speaker2  No. And then I want to just do a perimeter around the fence and see if there's any holes on the bottoms.
283.44 322.32 speaker1  Go ahead and roll search for me. She comes outside and she's like, have you found him?
320.88 327.68 speaker2  He would come back. I know him.
326.96 357.20 speaker1  Correct. Okay. I would like you to find my dog. I'm working on it, ma'am. Thank you. there eating his food. He should be in the room eating his food right now.
354.56 368.32 speaker2  Otherwise, here's the plan. We're going to put up some signs. Thank you so much.
366.56 376.24 speaker1  I take them. And then she grabs one back and she's like, I'm going to hold on to this one. Thank you.
375.52 391.28 speaker2  Thank you. All right. And then I do what I said I was going to do. I'm going to do a lap around the neighborhood and yell Tyler out the window as I go. Awesome.
389.52 401.04 speaker3  For sure. For sure.
398.08 421.20 speaker1  You also don't see any homeless people in the area. You would notice as you're going around the neighborhood, the dogs in this neighborhood do seem to be like the ones who are outside, which there are probably a handful. They're all barking pretty loudly at different points. Not constantly, but like in spurts, you'll hear a bunch of dog ruckus and then nothing.
418.08 426.96 speaker2  Does Clark have knowledge of dog disappearances lately?
426.16 436.40 speaker1  the police about it.
430.56 459.92 speaker2  to the office. He would literally do a missing dog poster as part of his service to the council woman. He wouldn't do it for anybody else probably, but he's going ahead and doing it, making copies of the photos. And then going out and posting them. wherever dogs would turn up if they are found.
457.68 509.92 speaker1  combo thing going on in this town. I would assume. Lunch explorers. I would absolutely explore many lunches. How about those fat cats in Washington? All right. Do you want to give me a description of John Lee Pettymore?
504.16 523.28 speaker3  His, uh, his father was killed by the DAA on his drug farm when like just after John was born and his, uh, his mother moved them back to contention where she was from. but he definitely wanted to turn his back on that a little bit.
521.60 528.24 speaker1  He's got light brown hair.
526.96 568.40 speaker3  He's pretty average build. Like he was very scrawny in high school. So he's a little like touchy. He like, he looks fine, but he thinks he's like still for sure. He really, he got in trouble a lot. uh, ended his career there. Got him into a safer line of work. Kind of. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. Oh man. Who was it? Yeah. That was tight.
568.00 580.56 speaker1  Perfect. Thomas, John Lee Pettymore is going out. Do you want to go to the spot where he called it in or do you want to go talk to Jimmy?
580.08 621.44 speaker3  to meet me there. You said he's my, like a distant cousin or something. Sure. Yeah, that totally works. You called us, Jim. was an oil spill.
619.60 626.32 speaker1  You know, I don't mess with that stuff anymore.
625.04 630.16 speaker3  I don't know what I know, Jimmy.
629.04 632.16 speaker1  I don't know what to tell you.
630.48 633.04 speaker3  Well, um, where are you at right now?
632.16 646.24 speaker1  No, I'm at the shop. I'll see you in a second.
644.48 647.84 speaker3  I want to ask Drew some details.
646.24 660.80 speaker1  What, you got a call from Jimmy? I got a call from Jimmy at a 4 AM. Yeah. I, he was describing to me this, uh, this, this black, uh, oil that was all over the ground out on a country road out Southeast.
659.84 672.00 speaker3  That's strange. Did he, did he describe the location more? Exactly. Oh yeah, for sure. All right. I'll be back soon. Okay.
670.80 676.64 speaker1  So yeah, I'm going to go.
674.64 682.24 speaker3  So I'm going to pop over there in my cruiser.
680.32 689.28 speaker1  He's like pretty much always stone. Just slinging sandwiches.
686.72 691.76 speaker3  five and then, uh, I need to talk to you for a minute. All right.
690.88 732.08 speaker1  Uh, what's up? hanging out. Where does he live? Went for drive. That part of town. Yeah, it's down there. He's like kind of got some land out there. Your, your family, like all of your distant relatives just kind of like have a plot of land that they've had forever. Um, so he's down in the Southeast part of town. It's a little bit more farmy out there.
731.28 735.36 speaker3  Gotcha. So Jimmy, what do you recall from last night?
734.00 737.52 speaker1  Go ahead and roll humid.
737.20 738.48 speaker3  Yeah.
737.52 777.84 speaker1  24 on a 50. He's going to level with you. in a while. So I went ahead and just did some, I did some mushrooms last night, man. And, uh, I mean, it was a crazy fucking trip. Yeah. I, uh, I definitely don't remember calling the police station. I'm really sorry, but don't worry, man. It's no big deal. I feel bad. Sorry, man. Okay.
777.28 789.60 speaker3  a look at things. Oh, just. Okay. Oh my God. Jesus Christ. I thought as long as you sell me some of those mushrooms.
788.80 876.24 speaker1  I love you guys. Hey. And so you guys drive out there and as you're driving, he's kind of telling you, uh, about his trip. It's good chip layer. Of course. And, uh, you guys make it out there. It's the exact spot that he had told Drew that he was at when you saw the oil spill and there's, uh, seems to be nothing out there on the ground. It was crazy, dude. It was nuts, man. There's just, Uh, it was, uh, it was a nuts night, man. I mean, I was drinking. I'll admit it. Yeah. I was drinking a bit too, uh, but I'm pretty sure I didn't come out here. Maybe I did. I don't fucking know, man. And he like goes through his phone and he sees that he made a call to the police station which is the first time he actually believes you that this happened. And he's like, Oh wow. Yeah, that's my bad.
872.24 888.48 speaker3  a woman's face destroyed last night cause she was driving drunk. I promise John, we don't want nothing to happen to that face of yours.
887.52 901.92 speaker1  It's a good face. Pretty good face. It's just no big deal. It's fine. And I'm sorry about the call. I don't know what that was about, but shit, you know, who knows what I was seeing?
899.44 906.00 speaker3  All right, well I'm going to poke around anyway. All right. All right. So do you like get out?
905.76 931.76 speaker1  All right. So you park and get out of the car. You're out on this country road. There's like nobody out here. Um, you see a few houses in the distance and stuff. Yeah. Nothing, uh, nothing too particular and checking the road, man. There's not even like a stain on the ground.
929.60 949.92 speaker3  I'm glad you saw something and said something. Yeah. You called us. That's the right thing to do. forward to these mushrooms, man. Yeah. I do. Yeah, dude.
948.56 951.84 speaker1  It sounds like a good time.
951.28 962.48 speaker3  Thanks, John. I really appreciate this, man.
957.92 999.28 speaker1  do your job and, you know, I should probably get back and, and, and take care of these good people at contention, get them the sandwiches they need. Something about this just bugs me. He will fucking something. All right. All right.
996.64 1023.92 speaker3  So he's slightly muscular, but he's still got a bit of a gut. So nobody can tell that it's on purpose. Messy. It just looks kind of messy. Perfect. Like dirty blonde.
1023.04 1032.24 speaker1  he washes it.
1028.80 1054.80 speaker3  up shirts as opposed to like cool vintage clothes. a little bit sunken in, uh, kind of like tired look about it. Cool, cool, cool.
1049.92 1156.08 speaker1  See, Keith Vigna is going to check out this, uh, house that has the doors swinging open or whatever. And it was called in by Mildred Mitchell, who is the neighbor. So would you like to go to the house or the neighbor's house first? have been well kept through generations and stuff, uh, you pull up and you see the house. It's across the street from Mildred's house. Mildred's house is like really well kept and the house across the street is just very plain normal looking. However, she is right. The screen door is swinging back and forth and the front door is actually open. Okay. I'm going to Mildred. Yep. Okay. So you knock and the door opens and you see a woman who has shock white hair and big rainbow earrings and she is wearing a Snuggie and drinking tea out of a big mug. Hey, Hey, how's it going there? It's going good. I don't, I don't, I don't talk to him very much. He's, he's very, uh, closed off.
1155.84 1156.40 speaker3  Yeah.
1156.08 1187.76 speaker1  Yeah. He always, you know, comes and goes, you know, he's a person. Yeah. You know, we're, we're pretty friendly in this neighborhood, but, uh, he's, uh, it's cold out, so I don't go out too much. Right. Yeah. Look comfortable.
1186.40 1191.04 speaker3  Yeah, yes, of course.
1190.72 1197.76 speaker1  Okay. It smells like bottle over in this house. And, uh, she's just this kind of crazy looking hippie lady. Yeah.
1197.44 1212.08 speaker3  Okay. Uh, well, you know, I'm going to go, uh, run over there and kind of check out the scene. I appreciate the call. Um, I might be back over to, uh, ask a few questions, but I think for now you've been helpful.
1208.24 1232.08 speaker1  Yeah, no, it's just, uh, I didn't, I didn't think too much of the door being open and stuff, uh, but it hasn't shut in a while. So I thought I'd make, give you guys a call. open and I was, I was just enjoying the view of the neighborhood and there was like a weird flash of light coming from the house. Uh, I don't know what that was.
1231.12 1237.52 speaker3  From inside that house?
1232.08 1260.00 speaker1  Well, it seemed to be from that house, maybe, uh, definitely from the neighborhood in that area, I guess. I thought it was strange. I looked to see if there was a, a car of some sort, but, uh, you know, it takes me a while to get up sometimes. So I must've missed it. I don't know, but it was pretty strange. Okay.
1257.92 1266.08 speaker3  Uh, but for now I'll be next door. So, okay. Okay. Bye.
1265.52 1272.32 speaker1  Okay.
1270.24 1275.28 speaker3  see if I can find out this guy's name.
1274.24 1288.80 speaker1  John Peters. John Peters. There's a car and his driveway and the screen door is swinging back and forth in the wind. The front door is wide open. All right.
1288.08 1309.36 speaker3  if anyone's home. Nothing. Nothing. All right. Uh, we get my flashlight. Are we, it's daytime right now. It is daytime. All right. I'm gonna get my flashlight out. I can find anything.
1307.60 1347.12 speaker1  So it's a large wooden door. It is open, but as you walk by, you notice that the doorknob is like fully embedded into the drywall on the wall where it is. Okay. So it's like stuck open basically right in the living room, which is the room that you see when you first walk in, there are a couple of picture frames broken on the ground and It is wide open. There is a broken lock and a pair of bolt cutters sitting in front of it. This guy clearly liked to drink. Okay.
1345.68 1351.76 speaker3  No, I mean this trunk. Yeah.
1347.44 1359.28 speaker1  I mean the, the, the picture frames that are broken on the ground, but it doesn't look like anyone stole a bunch of stuff. The TV is still there.
1358.00 1366.40 speaker3  Anything out of the ordinary?
1362.08 1370.16 speaker1  Basically there's some family pics, but it doesn't look like it's his nuclear family. Are we talking one story, two stories? One story.
1369.52 1380.56 speaker3  One story. I'm going to just go search the rest of the rooms in the house.
1378.80 1465.52 speaker1  Go ahead and roll search for me. That is a critical success. Well done. So as you go through, you're going to see a key chain hanging by the door. It has his house keys, a bottle opener, his car keys, a few small keys that say G10, G11, G12, and a key fob for a rewards program at Dirty Dog Grooming. And you would know from your time in the city that that is a pet salon franchise in the city. Okay. going through his stuff, maybe on his night table, there are some stubs that seem to be like bedding stubs. What? So you know how like when you go to a horse race? Yeah. You've got the like bedding. Yes. Sorry. Bedding stubs. There's nothing that really shows what he was bedding on or anything like that. stubs from some sort of bedding. Okay. but on your way back, you saw that there were words burned into the top of the trunk. What did they say? It says in all caps, do not open if you want to live.
1463.12 1468.08 speaker3  There is nothing in there.
1467.52 1496.64 speaker1  Okay. But it's empty. It's like foam padding. There are indentations. I gotcha. Yeah. One more thing. As you were like searching the house through on that critical success, you would see that the deadbolt was smashed. Like basically this door was kicked in and the wood in the frame of the door is like broken out. Okay. Okay.
1495.44 1514.88 speaker3  I'm gonna call into the station. It's Keith. I'm at this house. Are you familiar with John Peters? Do you know that name?
1514.56 1525.84 speaker1  No. Okay.
1521.20 1536.56 speaker3  I'm at his house and he hasn't been here in a couple of days and it looks like there's been a break in and so I'm thinking that we might have a missing persons kind of thing. I know.
1534.56 1567.68 speaker1  So let me look him up real quick. 60. That is a seven. Let's see. What would you learn about John Peters? Like he has never, he hasn't done anything wrong really. Yeah. He did find, uh, he was in the hospital for a while, like a long time. He had a long stint in the hospital and that was like a couple years ago. Does it say why? No. Okay.
1566.56 1583.60 speaker3  Well thanks Drew. Go ahead and roll forensics. I have a zero. Okay.
1583.12 1588.56 speaker1  Probably. You're like, I've never done this before, but uh, we'll give it a shot.
1588.16 1590.40 speaker3  Okay.
1588.56 1604.48 speaker1  You think you know how to do this? Uh, you like get some scotch tape out and like... Is there anything else you want to do?
1601.60 1615.60 speaker3  I guess I'll file a report just saying that it looks like a break-in. I mean, I guess I can't file a missing persons because I have no other reason than the break-in to suspect that, um... Go ahead and roll an intelligence check for me.
1614.88 1638.16 speaker1  Yeah. On his key ring was a rewards program for... The doggy daycare or whatever. Yeah, the dirty dogs. Dirty dogs. or any like thing that would tell you that he ever had it. Do they know his name? Go ahead and roll human.
1637.20 1653.92 speaker3  Uh, you have no idea. Cool. I'm gonna make a note of the daycare or the doggy thing. Yeah. Okay.
1653.36 1662.96 speaker2  Hold on.
1661.20 1664.74 speaker1  You gonna skunk, skunk in there?
1664.24 1676.48 speaker3  Yeah. Let's see, do you, have you ever seen John with a dog? Uh, John with a dog? No? I don't think he has a dog. Okay. I know.
1676.16 1678.08 speaker1  Yeah.
1677.68 1697.60 speaker3  Okay. And something clicks in Keith's mind. All right. Okay. Is that all? That's, that's, that'll do it. You can go back to, uh, tending to your skunk. I'm knitting. Yeah, go back to knitting. Thank you. Yeah, I'll come see what you did later.
1697.04 1706.40 speaker1  Have a good night.
1700.56 1711.84 speaker3  I'm gonna go back to the station and, um, I also want to get in contact with Clark and see what he found out about this dog.
1711.36 1721.44 speaker1  Cool. The three of you meet up for lunch at the police station.
1720.08 1727.36 speaker3  Let's go to Klinker's.
1726.16 1732.48 speaker2  chomping on it at his desk.
1731.68 1746.40 speaker3  subtropolis. I'll just canonically, I'll just get a, I'll order a pizza.
1744.08 1759.92 speaker2  She's missing a black lab named Tyler. She hadn't done anything to find it. So I went ahead and put up some posters for her and did a lab around the block and called the humane society.
1757.52 1848.96 speaker3  So I went and checked out that abandoned house. I talked to the neighbor Mildred Mitchell. She is a quirky little hippie lady, but anyway, she let me know. His name's John Peters that lives there. Obviously it looks like somebody had broken in. It was kicked open. The dead bolt had torn off some of the wood from the door frame and door handle was sticking into the dry wall. He had left his key chain with like his key fob and stuff. So it looks kind of a little suspicious that somebody broke in and he had a big trunk there. And on the top of the trunk, it said, do not open if you want to live. Totally empty. Like nothing else had been stolen. The TV was still there and all that. But I did notice on his key chain that he left, he had like a rewards, like loyalty card for dirty dog, dirty dog grooming. He, there was no, there was no signs of a dog living there. And I asked, I went back and asked the neighbor and she said she'd never seen him with a dog, which kind of makes me think, I don't know why he would have that loyalty key chain. Definitely bizarre and dirty dogs. It's in the city. This dog's gone. I don't know what the connection there would be, but I, it could, it could be something just to think about. Isn't it as plain as day? Man loves dog. Dogs loves man. They run away, run away together. Damn.
1847.84 1859.60 speaker4  What'd you find out? What kind of oil? Canola?
1856.72 1903.84 speaker3  subtropolis, he, he was just up real late and pretty tired. I think he was seeing things. So there was no sign of a oil spill? No sign. Nothing like that. No, Jimmy's all right. You know what I mean? He's, he's going a little too hard at subtropolis. Well, what did he see? He said it was like, no, he didn't. He didn't remember this at all. Andrew had a little more details about what the car had said. I said it was like a thick black oil just all across the road and the fields. Yeah. This was at 4am in the morning. Yeah. I went out there and there's no sign of it at all. Nobody would have cleaned it up.
1901.84 1909.20 speaker4  That would have been something that we would have known about. Yeah.
1908.48 1925.76 speaker3  God death cult. I wouldn't suspect. Probably not. Probably not.
1923.20 1940.16 speaker2  She said there's been a rash of homeless people in the neighborhood.
1936.08 1958.24 speaker3  Let's compare addresses to where she lives and where this abandoned house is. Either the rose or the bow tie. Are we talking the same, same street? Same neighborhood for sure.
1952.40 1982.40 speaker1  is on the same street, but south of the council woman's house on the same street. Okay. Interesting. TNT. We know drama.
1977.60 1992.48 speaker3  So I think John Peters is the dog and he ran away. Is this some kind of joke? Yeah, it's a, it's a, I'm sorry.
1990.64 2007.60 speaker4  We're talking about missing people, missing dogs. I shouldn't be joking around. I gotta, I gotta grow up into these britches.
2002.72 2013.04 speaker2  In your investigation of the house, could you tell how long it had been vacant?
2008.24 2021.44 speaker3  So Mildred told me that she, the last time she saw John Peters was two days ago. And I checked, she didn't know his name.
2016.88 2064.72 speaker4  Mostly just junk stuff, but I don't think that he was in the house when it got broken into because there didn't seem to be signs of any struggle or anything like that. for a long stint a couple of years ago. it just said that he was there for a while, but I did, I don't know why.
2063.60 2069.20 speaker2  Take a look at my dog. I still have a tail.
2069.04 2086.08 speaker3  Yeah.
2082.08 2109.12 speaker4  But she said that she, you know, didn't get up in time to like see exactly where the source was, but I couldn't find anything that would have caused that coming from inside the house. Um, the only thing out of place was the trunk.
2103.36 2119.68 speaker1  say G 10, G 11, G 12, and a key fob for rewards program at dirty dog grooming.
2117.60 2125.84 speaker4  beer cans just kind of strewn about the place.
2123.84 2140.32 speaker2  That is a good detective work.
2138.08 2165.12 speaker4  I'm like, I try to get some fingerprints off the truck. I don't know if this is how you do it, but do you want this?
2164.08 2168.32 speaker1  Half of them are mine.
2167.36 2177.12 speaker4  Did I do this? I won't tell you which one up in the city.
2176.24 2198.96 speaker3  Yeah, I went to the city.
2197.12 2203.36 speaker4  You know, also I was a little scared. It's a creepy old house. You guys want to go back?
2202.32 2206.16 speaker3  We should probably have Ray.
2205.60 2210.24 speaker4  Damn. That could have been good.
2208.88 2221.44 speaker2  I did call the dog groomer.
2217.28 2237.76 speaker4  And the person that I was on the phone with was not familiar with his name.
2234.64 2248.48 speaker3  There is no police academy in this town of 5,000 people. You know what?
2244.72 2253.44 speaker4  I think maybe I should go check out what was in his car. Cause people tend to keep things important to them. Yeah.
2251.60 2276.24 speaker3  Maybe we should all go check this house out. It sounds like it might be a linchpin in this whole mystery. You know what they say? Three's company.
2274.32 2280.64 speaker2  I put the station's number on it.
2279.52 2282.32 speaker1  No one has called yet.
2281.36 2291.60 speaker2  Keep me posted. Perfect.
2288.72 2314.48 speaker1  go past Bean's pond on the way to the house. As you pull up, Keith, I think you would probably notice right away that John Peters' car is not in the driveway and the door is closed.
2312.96 2326.96 speaker4  Is the mail still there? Still there?
2325.52 2343.92 speaker1  The mailbox is empty. Is the door still open? No, it's closed. maybe one in the driveway and you go up and knock on the door and you get no response.
2341.12 2346.56 speaker2  Oh, I mean the door has been kicked in previously.
2345.84 2372.48 speaker1  I go and open it. You open the door into this house. You see there are, there's some glass on the ground. There's a bunch of like bottles and cans out and about. Fuck.
2371.60 2375.60 speaker3  It was right there. The one that said, do not open if you want to live.
2374.32 2400.48 speaker4  Yeah, it was right there. It's not there now. Are you supposed, who are you supposed to be?
2396.64 2412.88 speaker3  Look, uh, we actually, this is the first time any of us have been to the Peters' house. Uh, am I John Peters? Keith wrote down the address wrong.
2411.04 2414.00 speaker2  Keith brought us to the wrong house.
2412.88 2431.04 speaker1  Oh, we swatted this dude. where the picture frames were, but they're now like all sitting on like a desk.
2428.24 2437.60 speaker4  Why would he have moved the trunk and not like called? Well, we're probably dealing with some shit that he didn't want to talk to the police.
2436.56 2439.04 speaker2  Yeah, there seems to be.
2438.56 2449.04 speaker1  Carpet. There's like a little indentation where Keith claims the trunk was. Believe me guys.
2447.04 2454.32 speaker4  All I found, like I said, was those keys.
2451.84 2470.40 speaker3  Did you roll to search this house? I crit succeeded. I don't know what that means, but it sounds good. The hell Vigna? Sorry dude, it's kind of rubs off.
2469.36 2478.88 speaker1  Oh shit, yeah.
2476.72 2488.16 speaker4  I'm trying my, I want to do good.
2485.68 2494.80 speaker3  That's, you should take a look at him. What kind of money was he throwing down? He was throwing down some heavy money.
2493.60 2530.16 speaker1  Like hundreds or thousands. Hundreds per night, but on multiple nights. So basically these stubs are from the past, not this month, like not anytime in November. These stubs are from the future. They're, none of them are from November. They're all from October and previous. And there was a lot of money being bet and he never won.
2527.92 2535.52 speaker3  And there is no indication what he was betting on.
2533.68 2546.64 speaker2  Is he always betting on the same thing? He's always betting on it and oh yeah.
2542.88 2554.40 speaker1  crazy bets, like 30 to one, 50 to one bets. None of these are like two to three. None of these are good bets. He's making bad bets.
2552.72 2561.68 speaker3  Is this racing of some kind? There's numbers.
2561.36 2568.40 speaker2  No. Okay. Oh, maybe sometimes. Yeah.
2567.04 2572.80 speaker1  And there's a knock at the door.
2571.44 2584.08 speaker3  It's clearly open.
2579.28 2594.32 speaker1  She's wearing a Snuggie and she has a big mug of tea.
2593.60 2597.12 speaker3  Who came by?
2594.32 2603.60 speaker1  Well, miss Mildred, the men who came by.
2602.40 2620.64 speaker3  They look official at all.
2618.72 2626.08 speaker2  Oh, eating dogs, eating dogs.
2624.96 2635.04 speaker3  Is that your Lippmann test? Like, is he in a suit or not? He's homeless.
2632.56 2647.60 speaker2  Yeah, no, it was to fish for what they were wearing.
2643.76 2656.96 speaker1  and the other one took the other car and they both left after they came out into the house and such.
2656.32 2680.16 speaker4  The trunk?
2678.16 2724.56 speaker3  It was like a white Toyota.
2722.56 2734.80 speaker1  Oh, that's a 54 on a 50. It was maroon.
2733.04 2741.92 speaker4  Put an APB up for that.
2740.16 2755.20 speaker1  Watching the three Stooges routine.
2754.72 2762.48 speaker2  Who?
2761.04 2766.64 speaker4  You seem to be. I used to drive a maroon 97 Oldsmobile Cheeto.
2765.36 2771.84 speaker3  Was it one like that?
2770.64 2776.48 speaker4  What kind of car do you drive?
2775.68 2781.68 speaker1  Well, you know what?
2779.20 2792.88 speaker3  This is what people want to hear. It's actually unseasonably warm if you recall. Fly to fly to the stream.
