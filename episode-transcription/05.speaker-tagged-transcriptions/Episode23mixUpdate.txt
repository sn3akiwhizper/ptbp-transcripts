0.00 195.48 speaker0  Hello my patients, it's your doctor, Wolf the Dog, and I'm here to check the charts so I can diagnose what the fuck is plaguing Contention here on 694.2 PTBP, Contention's only radio show. Y'all I'm scrubbed up and ready to go. This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from at bfevans19 on Twitter and Reddit who blessed us with a glowing 5 star review on Apple Podcasts, quote, and now Wolf has a special announcement for all you agents in the field out there, 42, 65, 20, 73, 75, 72, 65, 20, 74, 6F, 20, 64, 72, 69, 6E, 6B, 20, 79, 6F, 75, 72, 24, F, 76, 61, 6C, 74, 69, 6E, 65, end transmission, end quote. My producer has a note here, apparently Reddit user KRUCZ36 has made a subreddit for pretending to be people located at r slash pretending to be people. The first person to decode the message and post it in the subreddit will receive the pride that comes with being the best agent in the field and also the ability to write up their own Howlin' with Wolf announcement to be read by your personal physician, Dr. Wolf. And as always, if you want to see behind the scenes of 694.2 PTBP, follow along at pretending pod on Instagram and Twitter. There's a Facebook, sure, but Zuckerberg is a fuck face. Now back to reality. Oh, there goes gravity. It's time for the news. After officers Bishop and Vigna had the most uncomfortable dinner since the last supper, some real plot heavy shit went down. Keith Vigna was approached by his niece, Francis Beans. Upon accepting her proposal, the two are driving East away from contention. John Lee Pettymore and Drew Andrews bonded over shared fortune after a smooth transaction. Clark Bishop saw an impossibility out of his window and then woke up in an unfamiliar place with an unfamiliar face. Strap on your restraints and bite down hard because this is going to be a fucking wild ride.
193.34 328.80 speaker2  It is a Chrysler Sebring. She has offered you $1 million to kill her father, your brother, Ferguson Beans. She tells you she is going to take the secret way to avoid security and begins driving on a narrow path through the woods, trees missing her side mirrors by inches every couple of feet. And then she pulls up to a black iron fence seemingly out of place in these thick woods. Francis grabs a backpack from her back seat and motions for you to follow her as she opens a hatch in the ground and jumps inside disappearing from view. I follow her down the hatch. by these red lights every like 15 feet on the walls of this tunnel. It's dank down here. Had I ever been here before? I mean, you and your brother kept in touch kind of, but not really. So had I been the secret way before? No, absolutely not. All right, cool. So anyway. tells you right before, she's like, um, we're about to pop up above ground and it is like this sweet spot where there's no security cameras looking and we'll be able to take an easy direct route into the house. You can do that. I am going to bail and then I will meet up with you later when it's finished. All right. Are you sure you can't come with me? Uh, yeah, I'm pretty fucking sure that it would look a little bit more suspicious if two of us were coming then maybe just one where we're trying to be stealthy, right? And avoid people seeing us. So I think this one's on you, my dude. Have you ever thought about going into the force?
325.72 340.52 speaker3  The one that I'm on in the police force. Maybe not.
338.40 347.84 speaker2  So maybe I wouldn't be a great police officer. Maybe I'd be about as good of a police officer as you are, Keith. Oh, you'd be a much better police officer than me.
346.84 361.96 speaker3  Um, okay. Just show me the route that I need to take. Okay.
356.36 374.16 speaker2  are on the property and then, uh, which one is Ferguson's and how you need to get up into his room and like where to hide, basically like written on her hand. It's written on her hand.
368.28 380.72 speaker3  I put my hand up to her hand and my slightly sweaty palm is hold it on a little bit and then take it off. And now it's just on my hand, but tattoo style first. Yeah.
379.72 481.12 speaker2  Yeah. And she is super grossed out the entire time your hand is touching your hand. She's like, I hate this. I hate this. I'm taking a picture. This is so, why didn't you just take a picture evidence I'm a cop. up in this hatch for you and looking out, you're into the world. It's this beautiful, nice little place. Uh, Ferguson beans and his wife, Stacy live in two separate houses, right on the County line between contention and the city. They both own one of the homes and they use a weird archaic marriage law. So they can both vote in both counties. with lots of sharp lines, glass walls and geometrical patterns. And Stacy's home is an old Victorian with a wraparound porch and a turret reaching into the sky from one corner. And there's almost a line like in the grass where you can see the, like the County line And uh, as you can see from your hand, your backwards hand map, uh, you've got a direct route into the back of Ferguson's home, uh, where you won't be seen by security.
480.12 483.80 speaker3  Yeah, absolutely.
481.12 497.96 speaker2  So you can, I mean, you're just walking, there's like nobody here. It's super dead. You can maybe see there's like one or two lights on in the other home, the Victorian home, Stacy's house. Uh, but there are no lights on inside Fergie's Fergie's home.
495.18 523.84 speaker3  And I'm, she told me to go into his house, his house. Yeah. They actually live in separate houses. Okay. of door is it?
520.70 527.00 speaker2  it's like, welcome home Ferguson. This like voice comes over the top.
526.00 531.74 speaker3  I pause.
530.74 535.58 speaker2  Nope.
534.58 544.10 speaker3  Yeah. Walking through his house, everything is automated.
540.70 554.90 speaker2  So like everything is super automated. The like, everything looks super nice. Everything's really minimalistic. Okay.
550.18 567.02 speaker3  I want to go like outside and try to find the breaker or something for the house and just like turn all the, you know, power off. So yeah. Yeah. You can do that. All right. Easily. I do that. And then I go back to that door and walk in. Okay.
564.86 601.94 speaker2  I assume that you left it like cracked so that you could get back in. Yeah. You go in and everything's off. Cool. Completely dark inside. Just go upstairs and get into his room and hide in the closet. And he's going to be drunk or high or both when he comes home and he'll just pass the fuck out in bed and just put a bullet in him and leave as soon as you can. Okay.
598.50 604.94 speaker3  I'm going to grab, stabbing him is seems pretty hard. It's really intimate. Yeah.
603.94 608.34 speaker2  I don't want to do that either.
607.34 629.22 speaker3  Maybe. Yeah. If you're going to stab him. Does he have some sort of like chemicals or something like if he's going to be drunk and pass out, I could just like suffocate him or something. Yeah, absolutely. Uh, roll.
627.60 644.66 speaker2  You're not like under duress, I guess. I mean, you'd be, you'd be stressed out, but with a 40 you can for sure find it. It's a 12. Hell yeah. So going through, you actually find, um, what do you want to find?
643.66 660.46 speaker3  Like chloroform. Yeah. I don't know. What do you mix to make mustard gas? They did it in King of the Hill once. I'm on a list now.
657.94 664.26 speaker2  I just Googled mustard gas ingredients.
660.46 674.94 speaker3  I did mustard gas mixture. Bleach and ammonia.
673.94 677.94 speaker2  Yeah. He's definitely got those things.
676.94 703.34 speaker3  Yeah. I do that. Um, and I get like a towel. Towel. Yeah. And I'm going to get the bleach and ammonia. I'm not going to mix it together until he's there because I don't want to kill myself because I'm pretty sure it's like pretty easy to do. Okie doke. And I take those upstairs to his room and hide in the closet. All right.
695.22 734.70 speaker2  So when you walk into Ferguson's room, uh, the lights are off, but there are candles lit. Uh, one candle on either side of the bed and by the candle light, you can see a woman in bed wear laying on top of the sheets, but you know that this woman is not Stacy. And this is an older woman, probably at least a generation older than you and Fergie.
733.70 740.94 speaker1  not Fergie. Who are you? What? I am. I'm not.
739.70 742.94 speaker3  Oh, okay.
741.94 751.34 speaker1  Is Ferguson okay?
748.86 760.90 speaker3  Somebody broke in or something. What are you doing here? Did you break into the house?
757.98 765.90 speaker2  No, I'm, I'm not. Who are you? I'm Joan. Joan. What?
764.90 793.18 speaker3  Joan Robin.
788.70 800.38 speaker2  That way he could, you know, he could rib his business partner about sleeping with his mother and a million dollars is a million dollars, right?
798.98 803.94 speaker3  It's a good round number.
802.10 807.54 speaker2  I think you've got two options here.
804.94 816.70 speaker3  I think it's best that you leave right now. I give you my gun and when Ferguson walks in the door, you shoot him. Wait, what?
815.70 821.50 speaker2  You heard me.
817.70 855.50 speaker3  You won't get a million dollars, but I can promise you a little money if you'll do it. The less, you know, the better, but go ahead and roll persuade. What's your persuade skill?
852.74 897.78 speaker2  How much extra are we talking on top here? 500? It is, but uh, it's your service pistol. Okay. You know what? enough to bring a different gun. I wasn't. Okay. Your search roll from earlier, we'll have it, you know, go over and you can definitely find it.
896.78 925.72 speaker3  So I find his like revolver. Okay. Here's the deal. I'm going to wait in the closet so that you don't get any funny ideas and I've got my service pistol on me. I trust you to do this, but I'll be here just, you know, in case anything bad happens more for your safety than anything. And then I opened the closet, give her a wink.
923.34 1008.54 speaker2  up to the house. And if you go to the window and look, you would see a white 15 passenger van with the words Jesus Christ ministries in all caps painted on the side. It pulls in to this beautiful, pristine circle drive in front of the house and the van is pulling a white trailer that also says Jesus Christ ministries in all caps, a big trailer on the back of the van. This beautiful man gets out of the passenger side of the van. He has perfect hair, perfect teeth, perfect jawline. He's wearing the fuck out of a bright white suit with a red Rose pinned perfectly to his lapel. It is your brother Ferguson beans. He clicks a button on his keys and as he walks toward his home, the ground around the van and trailer begins to move and shift and the entire vehicular ensemble is transported below ground on some crazy futuristic elevators of sorts as the driveway closes back up with Thank you. And then you, uh, go back in the room and hop in the closet. I hop in the closet.
1007.38 1042.70 speaker3  Just however you see fit. I don't know if you want to do it just as soon as he walks in or if you want to let him get in the room, but just do it and you know, we'll figure it out. Uh, I'll help you out once the deed is done. Okay.
1034.18 1055.02 speaker2  It's pitch black and you hear the door open and shut and then you hear your brother holler upstairs. You hear a very scared Joan Robin calling back.
1053.50 1057.02 speaker1  Must've been the storm.
1056.02 1171.30 speaker2  Why not? Let's set the mood, right? You can hear it. It's pouring. Yeah. Oh, I don't know. I guess. I don't know. Your feet are wet from the wet grass. Spooky. Yeah. That's so scary. This is a horror podcast. Remember? shot and another shot and another shot. And then you just hear crying. Is it a female crying? I opened the door. out and you see your older brother in this beautiful white suit, Rose on his lapel looking fresh as hell. But the Rose is not the only red part of his outfit now as he is just completely riddled with holes from his own gun. Yeah.
1168.70 1172.30 speaker3  I rolled a 45 and my current sanity is 24.
1171.30 1190.72 speaker2  Okay. So for convincing a stranger to kill your brother and then seeing your older brother's dead body, uh, on a failure, I'm going to go ahead and have you roll a D six, three. All right. Lose three sanity. Where are you at?
1189.72 1195.90 speaker3  Bringing point is 20. Oh boy. Yeah.
1192.72 1205.42 speaker2  So you are kind of losing it, right? You just start crying. I think probably, you know, you guys are just crying in each other's arms.
1201.30 1225.50 speaker3  I cry for, you know, a couple of minutes and then I kind of snapped back to it. to think of how to clean all this up. Uh, I think I saw some cleaning stuff in the, in the closet while I was in there. Just give me a second and we can clean this up and we'll figure out what to do with the body.
1224.50 1231.22 speaker1  Okay.
1227.10 1235.26 speaker2  She just kind of like sits at the end of the bed and with her head in her hands. Okay.
1233.22 1239.58 speaker3  I get the bleach and ammonia.
1235.26 1247.86 speaker2  Maybe I brought like a little cup with me or something to mix it up, pour them in there.
1246.86 1267.74 speaker3  Yeah. Um, and then I was probably gonna hurt my hands, but whatever. I get the rag and I put it in the mixture and I bring it out and walk over to Joan. Yeah. This seems like a great thing to clean blood up with. Look at me real quick.
1264.10 1273.38 speaker2  She's not in any a state of mind to think about anything.
1267.74 1282.90 speaker3  So she just kind of looks up at you and I take my right hand with the mixture. I put it up on her face, grab the back of her head, like with my arm and just hold it there.
1281.62 1341.90 speaker2  Let's do a strength contest. Her strength is 45. What is yours? means. Well, I know what it means. It means a ass that poops. Yeah. Not a good one. It's a, but the poops. So I missed, you missed as this is happening. She fights you and she can get her hand in between her mouth and nose and the towel that you're using. And she starts yelling. What'd you get? Describe what happens. Why did we just cheer you killing an innocent woman? Well I guess not. She's a murderer. Well, are you?
1340.90 1376.98 speaker3  Okay. So I ripped the towel off her face. I'm like, Oh my God, I'm sorry. I just, I saw you kill my, or I saw my dead brother and I just started to freak out. she stops fighting back.
1375.98 1386.22 speaker2  I do not pass. Yeah. So you just killed a woman covering up the murder that you made her do. Right.
1385.14 1409.62 speaker3  Can I do that? I want to take like my, I think I have like a handkerchief or something. I want to take the gun, put it in her hand and put it up to her head and shoot so that it looks like she killed herself.
1402.50 1447.14 speaker2  I'm going to say that you're just in this weird state of like shock and determination And that's what you've made it look like. I need you to roll. Let's just go D4 honestly, cause it's not as bad as, uh, you know, there's no tie there I guess. That's a three again. All right. Lose three sanity down to 18. All right. And what's your power?
1446.14 1450.14 speaker1  I'm doing crazy. Yes you are.
1449.14 1480.38 speaker2  I'd say. Yeah. But it was all for the money. I did it all for the money. You've just lost six sanity within five minutes. So you're losing your goddamn mind. However, as you're walking away, you see that Ferguson is wearing that watch that you remember
1479.38 1491.30 speaker3  of him. Where do you put it? On is probably not a good answer in my pocket.
1485.84 1548.70 speaker2  When you take the watch off of Ferguson with this handkerchief, you see that the face of the watch is blank. There's nothing on it, which is odd for a watch. And when you slip it into your pocket, it feels like your consciousness is changing the channel and you begin to phase out of your reality and you seem to be somewhere else entirely. You feel wet grass and dirt on your fingers and you were looking at a door in the ground And on the door is an inscription, three lines. Where do you want to end up? What do you mean?
1544.62 1574.10 speaker3  I do want to do like a quick, obviously I want to put like the chemicals and shit back where I found them, wipe them down. Anything that I touched, I want to wipe down so that I can't be associated back to being here. Sure. I'm going to leave the bodies and shit where they are. Cause you know, I guess I'll just walk back to that tunnel. Okay. Do I have her phone number or should I, I don't really know where I am. motel.
1573.10 1633.24 speaker2  Hotel motel. basically somewhere else in your eyes as you begin cleaning up, making sure that the scene of the crime looks exactly how it should and that your fingerprints are gone and that any idea that there was a third person there is gone. And we see you get into the tunnel and walking through the tunnel and your eyes are still just, you know, kind of glazed over as you, um, not only have lost so much sanity from doing and seeing what you just did and saw, but also it's almost like you are seeing that feeling of being at this place with this door that's buried in the ground. The whole time you're doing that stuff, you're just like halfway there, halfway here, and then cut to you laying in bed at hotel motel, but you still have that watch in your pocket
1631.04 1640.24 speaker3  Do I have like a safe in this hotel motel? Yeah.
1638.64 1707.08 speaker2  Do I have the same look in my eyes? No. You're back. I'm back. stranger named the Duke, paid him a grand to tell you Marvin Glass buys from him in bulk, and paid 8 of your cousins 10 grand and a 24 pack of keystone light, to which they each took a petty more sky shot and headed off into the night. me. This is amazing. I thank you for showing me how to shoot a gun.
1702.58 1714.28 speaker3  And I point my gun at him and I'm like, can you give me that gun back now?
1710.28 1747.88 speaker2  He passes it over and he's like, oh, that's okay. Sorry, man. That's fine. All right. Well, mostly I wanted to thank you for your friendship. You too, man. You know what, Drew?
1746.88 1751.68 speaker3  Yeah. Case an idiot and Clark's real uptight.
1750.68 1770.52 speaker2  Well, you're my best friend in life. Yeah. Hey, hey. Cool, man. But, uh, I am gonna leave. That's cool. Yeah. Get the fuck out of here, man. And I think I'm gonna bail. I think I'm out. You're out? Yeah.
1763.68 1772.52 speaker1  I think I'm gonna get a little, uh, a little spot, you know, and, and maybe north, I don't
1771.52 1780.88 speaker2  All right.
1779.40 1814.86 speaker3  sticky paper together. You're the goddamn peanut butter to our jelly, man. And I'm the jelly in Clark and, uh, Clark, Clark and Keith are the pieces of bread. Like, we need you, Drew. Contention needs you. We gotta save this fucking town, man. And then we can go to Florida or wherever else people go.
1811.76 1833.08 speaker2  I'll see you around, John. And he, uh, takes his briefcase and he gets into his car, heads down the long, long driveway that you have out to your county road. What do you want to do? Is there anything you want to take care of before you call tonight?
1832.08 1837.72 speaker3  How tired am I? I did a bump, right? I think so, yeah.
1835.28 1856.00 speaker2  Your willpower should be at 12. What do you do? How do you prep?
1851.76 1860.96 speaker3  drunk angry voicemails as I just pounded fucking keystones.
1859.96 1864.96 speaker2  Is it ringing? Yeah.
1863.96 1878.44 speaker3  What's his voicemail sound like?
1876.52 1890.80 speaker1  Leave your number at the beep. Beep.
1888.56 1900.56 speaker2  Stupid piece of shit. Messing with my smoky DVDs, you goddamn bandit.
1896.08 1912.32 speaker3  I'm going to stick a boot up your ass and then I'm going to fucking marry the turd that comes out of that ass.
1906.40 1928.68 speaker2  I'm going to keep yelling about $5 million and then something about a turd coming out
1926.48 1956.00 speaker3  my teeth and stuff. And I send Keith Vigna a text message that just says, I know, love it. I kind of spent some time, as I'm a wealthy man now, I have a fortune to protect. So I am a little bit nervous about all these, these monsters and ghouls and entities that have descended upon my town. Got a lot more stake in this place now.
1953.16 1974.60 speaker2  Now you got to protect your town now. You could own this town.
1969.72 2005.68 speaker3  A rich man has no troubles friend. a joint on his couch, dreaming of his millions, but also of terrible monsters.
2001.16 2113.88 speaker2  mess of a living room by the DVD menu screen of Smokey and the Bandit. The night sky is beginning to turn bright, but the sun has yet to peak over the horizon. It is early on this cold December morning and the air smells crispy. John, you wake up abruptly to the sound of two gunshots. What do you do? I scramble for my pistol. You scramble it for your pistol, find it. And I get, you know, behind some cover, but I peek out a window. hostage, the Pettymore cousins and Drew Andrews. She is wearing jeans with a white shirt and a leather jacket. She is gaunt with crazy hair and enormous thick glasses that make her already large eyes look even bigger. Six Pettymore boys and Drew are on their knees with their hands behind their backs. Their mouths are duct taped and most are bleeding from some part of their body. This is even more apparent as all seven of them have been stripped of their shirts. The other two Pettymore cousins are also bound and shirtless, but they are face down about twenty feet away from the group, and each has a puddle of blood growing from where their heads landed.
2112.88 2136.86 speaker3  it open. I know her, right?
2135.54 2142.50 speaker2  Come on out with your hands up. I come out.
2141.10 2146.86 speaker1  You know who I work for.
2144.90 2150.34 speaker2  He wants the gun John.
2147.86 2171.86 speaker1  He wants the gun? Not your gun. No, I know. He wants the other gun. I don't like it when people run away.
2164.82 2217.62 speaker3  I still probably hate you forever, but I see what you done and why you did it. Listen, your boss can have that gun when this is all said and done, but I don't particularly think that's what he needs. Or in another way of speaking, he wants to get his boys back, right? Yeah. regard. I think we kind of want the same thing, so what do you need? You can have that gun, but I don't think that's really... Let's talk about... You can have that gun, but I think you might find some... What do you need?
2214.82 2230.42 speaker1  I was sent here to collect the gun. If you don't have it, then I'm supposed to bring something back as collateral, you know, until you bring it. So uh... Alright. Hey, wait.
2229.06 2239.34 speaker3  I mean it's down at the station. But why don't you bring me as collateral? What? Bring me to your boss. I'd like to talk to him. Uh, wait.
2237.58 2260.14 speaker1  The gun is just at the station? No. That's what you just said.
2258.26 2272.70 speaker3  Yeah, okay.
2271.70 2320.38 speaker1  We don't need you. We just want the gun. He wants the gun. I'm going to bring him the gun. If not, I'll go ahead and, you know, if you can bring the gun, then that would be great. If you could go get it now, that'd be better. For me personally, I don't like being here. So... Alright, alright. Can I come with you? Sure. Jesus Christ, was it so hard? Let's go get the gun. Lady, you killed two of my cousins. Well, they tried to run away from me when I had a gun. I mean, how many do you have?
2319.06 2344.50 speaker3  Yes, Edward was.
2343.02 2349.26 speaker2  Sad day for the Patty Moore's. We're all like brothers, so it's fun.
2348.10 2352.58 speaker1  Yeah, we'll get the gun. Right now.
2350.26 2364.10 speaker3  If you can introduce me to your boss, I'll get you that gun.
2360.46 2377.98 speaker2  to you because she just killed two of your cousins. So first she's going to let the cousins all go. She's going to keep a gun on Drew.
2376.98 2390.98 speaker3  And I bet they could split. Yep.
2388.90 2393.50 speaker2  That's a, oh brother, we're at that reference.
2392.50 2407.14 speaker3  Perfect.
2400.34 2419.46 speaker2  So she's going to go ahead and have you and Drew drive in Drew's Mini Cooper. And she's going to sit in the backseat with a gun pointed at both of you as you guys go down to the station.
2418.46 2433.54 speaker3  about it. What you've done today was unforgivable. And there are many of us living in these Hills. We're coming for you.
2432.54 2461.02 speaker1  Okay. That's fine.
2451.62 2488.26 speaker2  So Clark, you are in this stone room, circular stone room with a stone table light shining down one man sitting across from you. He's holding this big fucker. And then he immediately puts it down in this like container in between his legs and puts the lid on it.
2487.26 2503.86 speaker3  at this lug. Who are you?
2498.74 2632.22 speaker2  circle of knowledge, which I believe I just inducted you into. We have a first task for you as a new member of the circle of knowledge. And he reaches into his pocket and he pulls out the small little plastic container and he slides it toward you, takes a gun out of his pocket. And it's not a normal gun. It's a tranquilizer kind of thing in the little package that he's sliding across the table toward you. It's clear on top and there are a couple needles in there. your will for some time. And what we're going to need you to do is, well, I don't know if you're aware of this, And we're going to need you to kind of get that under control. That way we can take back control of your town. So I'm going to need you to go back to contention. There should be one FBI agent who is coming in the morning to take over all of the police work in the town of contention. I don't see any way that they're going to keep you all on based off of literally everything that you've done. They're watching you. And that's one of the reasons that we're bringing you on is that literally no one will believe a word you say at this point, honestly. You have absolutely no credit to your name. They shoot out this little microscopic needle that has this toxin in it. And I need you to make sure that the FBI agent doesn't see anything funny going around in contention. I know you just met me and you just figured out my name, Leon Simpson.
2631.22 2647.46 speaker3  Tell me all about it.
2642.70 2665.50 speaker1  And then there were FBI agents that came and they had a black bag and they told us that we were going to have to put stuff in it to neutralize it or something. And there was these photos from a camera with tubes and a radio that made a man a cat and a cat a man. So, I mean, some stuff's been happening.
2664.50 2677.50 speaker2  Mm-hmm. What? What is this ooze, though, that you speak of? Do you see it everywhere or?
2676.50 2681.38 speaker3  How come?
2680.38 2710.06 speaker1  of this. Okay. Oh, and it made some, between you and I, a couple kids disappeared in it. Whoa. Haven't told anybody that. Whoa. Yeah.
2707.74 2734.38 speaker2  James, the mononym James? I do. Is he still around?
2730.06 2737.10 speaker1  It was, our chief Maggie Cook was in, it was her house. Okay.
2735.38 2740.10 speaker3  There were some other people in there.
2738.10 2773.42 speaker1  It was Maggie, and it was James. Maggie is dead? No, he got out of there. He rescued my dispatcher also. Dispatcher?
2772.42 2800.06 speaker2  My goodness. Okay. Well, that's crazy. I mean, do you guys know who did it?
2796.50 2812.22 speaker1  Well, I mean, if you had a lost dog, oh fuck, I fucked that up too. If you needed to cross the road at a crosswalk, we could help you with that.
2809.54 2838.16 speaker2  Well, this is going to be a bit more intensive than that. This shooting an FBI agent with the needles and then telling him what to do, but basically we're going to need you to keep them away from any of the strangeness, any of the goo that you've seen or ooze or whatever you're calling it, and that would just be great. You have 24 hours and then I need you to report back and we can make sure that you will be
2837.16 2842.36 speaker1  Exactly.
2841.36 3208.94 speaker2  Yeah, absolutely. And he slides a business card across and it says Leon Simpson and then it has his number and that's it. Currently we believe it is a vector from either another time, another place, or another reality. We're not quite positive, however, it is the thing that Paul Simon found that has connected the dots of the knowledge of the overseer, which you will attain one day within our elite group, however that is for another time. Basically these creatures, they have certain abilities that we have found a way to exploit and so we need them. And he opens up the one door in this room and it opens into another stone room. This one much larger. This circular room is 20 yards across and has a domed ceiling. The walls are stone and there are a handful of torches mounted to light the room. There are six large slabs of stone, each with a couple of people laying on them, circling a single unoccupied stone slab in the center of the space. Each person laying down has one of those giant fucked up worm things attached to them and many of them seem to have dead skin covering one or multiple limbs. And there is a woman in electric blue slacks and a bright yellow cardigan walking deliberately around to each slab, checking on each group and checking her watch. And her back is turned to you. When you walk into this room you're just kind of taking it all in. This is a legitimately horrifying sight I would imagine. chamber of the circle of knowledge and here is where we do our most important work. You see, these brave men and women, and he motions to the people laying on the slabs who all look very down on their luck. One might call them homeless looking. And he says, these fine individuals have dedicated their lives to the survival of humanity. of years and have begun to explain to people why they're dedicating their lives before skin or limbs for the cause. We want you to be one of us. And he kind of points at him and the woman in the electric blue slacks and bright yellow cardigan who is standing on the far side of the room with a notebook, taking notes. up and you know, we really like you around, we'd hate to lose you. So as he walks you out of the room, you hear the woman say, bye Leon, and you turn back and look and you recognize this woman. She is cold and vacant with a big smile on her face and her hair is covering one of her eyes. And she says, bye Clark. You feel a little pinch in your neck. Clark you come to in the back of a cab, trees lined both sides of the narrow gravel road you were bouncing down. Looking back, you see the gravel path leads to an opening where just enough plant life has been removed to open up space for a parking lot and a massive brick building with two enormous smokestacks reaching up into the canopy of trees encircling this property.
