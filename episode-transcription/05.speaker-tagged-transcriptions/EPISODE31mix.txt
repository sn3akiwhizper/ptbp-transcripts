0.00 210.00 speaker0  Welcome one and all to Contentions best radio station that is currently hijacking the radio waves of the city. And now I am hearing that we are also the city's best radio station as well. Well would you look at that y'all. This is your radio pirate ship captain Wolf the dog. And I'm here to steer all y'all's doubloons so I can buy myself a mini fridge for my new apartment here in the city. This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from NZO. Remember, if you want to write up something for your wolf to howl, tag at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter, tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook, or write a 5 star review and email us at PretendingPod at gmail dot com. NZO writes, Hey Mr. Dog, how you doin'? I feel like nobody asks you that. I would like to send a shout out to my lovely second half, Ryanna. She really isn't big into tabletop games, but the moment she heard this gem of a show, she was all ears. And she thinks everyone is doing a terrific job. Just wanted to tell her thanks for being my number one, even when I can be a real number two. I guess that's really it. So I will re-ask my initial question. How you doin'? You know, I've been alright, can't complain. Rent here in the city is a little nuts compared to the old basement back in contention. Those tasty, delicious little morsels of meat. Mmmm. So here is an exceptionally intimate version of the news. The other day, I was walking my dog, Wolf. Or it could have been the fact that she was covered in ranch dressin' that was getting my boy all riled up for love. Who can say? Please remember, my friends, we got ourselves a Patreon now. The link is in the show notes. And if you can't support us financially, please tell a friend about the show. And if you don't have any friends, please write a review on iTunes. And if you can't use iTunes, post about the show on Reddit. But no matter who you are, turn up the volume and clap on the three and four. It's kudzu with no backbone. Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. It's been a while.
209.00 215.00 speaker1  It's been a while. Been a while.
214.00 229.00 speaker2  I'm realizing now. Okay. Clark. Oh, fuck. I mean, Joe. See, I'm already here. I'm already ready to go. Already there. I'm already rearing to go, baby.
227.00 235.00 speaker1  In situ.
234.00 245.00 speaker2  Hi.
241.00 249.00 speaker1  If you haven't seen that video, go watch Have a Summer by...
247.00 250.00 speaker2  Do he and Kulop still do that one podcast they did?
249.00 253.00 speaker1  He still does it.
252.00 256.00 speaker2  Yeah, that's it. But she's not on it anymore. Gotcha.
255.00 260.00 speaker1  She got busy. She started writing and producing and all that. Yeah.
259.00 266.00 speaker2  Taylor, do you have anything to plug this week?
263.00 289.00 speaker1  Go be a teacher and mold young minds. Do the teach. Wait, what? Armpit hair.
288.00 294.00 speaker2  Your pubic hair.
292.00 295.00 speaker1  There's not a chance this will be cut.
294.00 314.00 speaker2  No, I don't. This is absolutely staying in. I really like my job. Well, at least you've been armpit hair. Let's jump. I love that. You should be a teacher.
313.00 318.00 speaker1  And don't we all? Take a look deep within yourselves.
316.00 428.00 speaker2  That's cool, yeah. You could also become a priest. Clark. A thick fog obfuscates your vision. It's heavy. The air, like gravity, is somehow stronger than usual. A whisper in your ear sends shivers down inside your spine. The voice is familiar. A stainless steel door appears in front of you, opening so near your nose you feel a drop in temperature as the cold metal swings by. A woman begins screaming behind you. And when you turn around, you see the face of Tildi B. Mitchell on a television screen. She begins repeating herself over and over. And then you are running down the street. You recognize this street. You live up here on the left. A familiar boy is about to walk into the house. You begin to scream, and you are surrounded by this thick fog. Your screams begin to echo infinitely into the sheer endlessness engulfing you. And then you hear a voice, and you look up, and you see, well, Taylor, why don't you tell us what Clark sees? Reiterated. What's he wearing?
426.00 429.00 speaker1  Gerald and Clark.
428.00 444.00 speaker2  What he's wearing? Mm-hmm.
438.00 460.00 speaker1  But Gerald, he's one who ages so gracefully that it almost looks like he's younger. He has lost a little bit of his hair, but he's like the most handsome, balding, old librarian you've ever seen. He never talked about tats, did he?
459.00 463.00 speaker2  I think he was wearing a- Secret tats? He was wearing a sweater vest.
462.00 465.00 speaker3  He was wearing a sweater vest with-
464.00 469.00 speaker1  Mm-hmm.
468.00 474.00 speaker3  Yeah.
473.00 476.00 speaker1  Anyway, he's looking good.
474.00 478.00 speaker3  Mr. Finkerson ain't looking tight.
476.00 491.00 speaker1  That's how you speak now?
488.00 493.00 speaker2  What kind of underwear does Clark wear?
492.00 498.00 speaker3  Yeah, yeah, non-stop.
493.00 537.00 speaker2  And he is also wearing a t-shirt from a gas station called Pump and Dump. And it's like December 6th, and it is quite cold outside. It's strange because you feel absolutely incredible. The past few days have been exhausting and non-stop. But you feel better than you felt in a very long time. So I'm going to need you to take your hit points and willpower all the way back up to full. Which takes you to what?
536.00 546.00 speaker3  That's my max. And willpower, you said? That brings me up to 12 is my max.
543.00 624.00 speaker2  You feel unstoppable. And Clark, around your wrist is a string that's attached to a bag of ice with a metal rod sticking out of the top. And this bag of ice is leaking red down the driveway the two of you are standing on. The suburban home this driveway belongs to looks exactly like all the other homes on this street with one key distinction. The mailbox says Jim Cook. You've got this string around your wrist, bag of ice connected to it. Bag of ice is leaking red down the driveway, metal rod kind of sticking up out. And you notice that there's also like a little, there's something else in the bag of ice.
622.00 642.00 speaker1  I thought that was our little banter. We walked here from the park. Don't you remember?
636.00 667.00 speaker3  And then I saw my partners and they were, they were shooting and fell in the crowd and they were... Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. I peek in. What do I see?
659.00 746.00 speaker2  Peeking in, you see this metal rod goes down into the bottom of the ice bag and it is surrounded by ice. So you just got the top of the rod, just the tip. Up against like the side of the bag on the inside, up against some ice, there is a small canvas bag. And by mini sessions, I mean full episodes as how they turned out. And... And you recognize this metal rod that's shoved inside this bag of ice is from the cage that you were in. It was one of the bars that was on the cage. but you know, the string at the top of a bag of ice, like a little rope thing. Got it, got it, got it. Your hand is just kind of through it.
745.00 776.00 speaker3  Like the drawstring? Yeah, exactly. Mr. Fingersen, is there anything on my back? Am I hurt? You look amazing.
769.00 793.00 speaker2  You see right, almost in the middle of your chest, but just a little bit off stage left, there is a gaping hole that goes all the way through you. Do you see anything, Mr. Fingersen?
787.00 798.00 speaker1  Perhaps that donut hole in the middle of you could have be filled in with some cluck.
796.00 808.00 speaker2  It hurts right here.
807.00 818.00 speaker3  That's a failure.
813.00 830.00 speaker2  You feel fine, but you're going to take half a D6 of sanity loss on that. Oh, shit. Okay, that's three. You lose three sanity taking you down to? 23.
829.00 847.00 speaker3  My breaking point is 18.
837.00 871.00 speaker2  the hole down into your body and creates this gelatinous cartilage walled tunnel that runs through you. And you can actually put your fingers in and as you press in to the skin that is technically inside of you, but is not because it's a tunnel. So it's outside of you still somehow. It just feels like an ear, you know, or like a nose. It's just that that cartilage kind of hard lumpy.
870.00 895.00 speaker3  Skin's covering it all. It doesn't hurt. It's like my body got a gauge, you know, like in your ears. Yes. You want to touch it? Not particularly.
892.00 900.00 speaker1  I was actually just on my way to go see my dear friend Jim. We have cashew chicken on Sundays together.
899.00 902.00 speaker3  Jim Cook.
901.00 926.00 speaker1  Why are you here? Jim is my dearest friend.
925.00 947.00 speaker3  Fingers.
939.00 967.00 speaker2  And he is wearing one of those full windbreaker outfits that's like purple and green and black and white. And like straight out of the 80s. And he is walking quite briskly and he's got these little goggles on that seem to make him more wind resistant. And as he approaches you he flips the goggles up onto his forehead. Hey fella.
966.00 974.00 speaker1  Hey. Hey fella.
970.00 1003.00 speaker2  You seem to be maybe a bit out of place. What's going on here? Do I recognize this person at all? Not even a little bit. But I'm far more concerned about what you're maybe doing out here on this property. Oh god. And he looks down and he sees the red going down the driveway and he's like, what? What happened there? That's no good.
1002.00 1012.00 speaker3  Oh a jello. Who's Mr. Fingerson? This year Mr. Fingerson.
1010.00 1039.00 speaker2  And your name was? Clark Bishop. Clark Bishop. And he pulls out his phone and he types and he says Clark Bishop. Okay that is, you know what? That is good information. So basically what we have here is you Clark Bishop not necessarily belonging in this neighborhood. Would Clark know where Jim's house is?
1037.00 1045.00 speaker3  Just from his, are we in contention?
1044.00 1048.00 speaker2  Gotcha. Suburbs.
1046.00 1066.00 speaker1  Now sir you will not talk to my son that way. Now we will be on our way and you can go do some more briskie boys. Okay you know what?
1062.00 1077.00 speaker2  I guess have a good day. Alright okay then. And he puts his goggles, he flips them right back down onto his eyes and he bails.
1076.00 1111.00 speaker1  That was exhilarating. I've never talked to someone so harshly before. It must have shown in my muscles. Now I have had a hard time processing what you've said about Jim but you know what I always say about a good researcher. If you don't see something first hand how could you possibly believe? Let's go inside.
1107.00 1125.00 speaker3  Mr. Fingerson did you just happen upon me here in the driveway? How'd you find me?
1117.00 1144.00 speaker2  So let's go ahead and as we watch Clark Bishop and Gerald Fingerson walk toward the house Yeah. So you died. I died.
1143.00 1157.00 speaker3  45 luck. Alright.
1152.00 1207.00 speaker2  from the Pulp Cthulhu rulebook and Clark chose... I'm heartier. Much heartier at a time such as this and actually how we're going to do that in this game is I'm going to give you a plus 40 on your Constitution. So what was your Constitution before? Past that it's going to be all successes unless you're disadvantaged in some way. Super cool.
1204.00 1219.00 speaker3  In jargon it gives me a higher initiative roll.
1213.00 1292.00 speaker2  Delta Green we don't actually roll initiative unless it seems like a fun thing for me to do at the time. So what we are going to do for Quickdraw is put Clark at the top of the order in every combat scenario and I'm going to let you spend 10 luck to act twice at the top if you would like to. Oh wow. point that you hit we had discussed Clark Bishop needing to express his anger through violence on a daily basis otherwise he would wake up the next day with a reduced amount of willpower. We are going to go ahead and take that idea and push it to excess. So what's going to happen is every time you roll a sanity and you fail but that roll would also fail power so if I ask for a sanity roll if you fail that roll but you also fail power which what's your power at? 60. but you're also going to immediately lash out physically. Ooh that's awesome.
1291.00 1302.00 speaker3  Exchange.
1300.00 1324.00 speaker1  Just cause I'm old doesn't mean I'm near the grave. I'm a sprightly 67 now I'm probably like 80.
1321.00 1340.00 speaker2  table and you just do as a character. I will say like and Joe did that sanity roll also fail on power and if so then I'm not going to say okay then I'll take control of your character or anything like that. I'll just do it. And get weird with it.
1339.00 1349.00 speaker3  Love it love it. Do I have to inflict harm or can I lash out in other ways?
1344.00 1359.00 speaker2  I would say lashing out at a being of some sort would be unnecessary. Okay. Sorry this sounded maybe like I said unnecessary. I'm physically to a being necessary.
1357.00 1371.00 speaker1  He has to hit my face. I'm a librarian. The power of words is more powerful than the power of fists.
1369.00 1374.00 speaker2  You've been doing those wrist curls though you'll be alright. You're right.
1373.00 1386.00 speaker1  I'm ready.
1385.00 1447.00 speaker2  the door swings open. and there's an upright piano in the entryway. The living room has papers and binders strewn all over the coffee table, couch, chairs, the floor. Really everywhere in the living room there's just papers and binders and papers and binders and the sun still low in the sky because it's early morning is shining in through the window illuminating a fair amount of stagnant dust that is just hanging there. kind of new idea that we've never done before so I'm going to have Taylor and Joe fill out a quick form off mic and it's going to be of the mad gab style. Persuasion.
1445.00 1449.00 speaker3  Is that the fill in the adjective, the noun?
1448.00 1463.00 speaker2  Okay cool. Stoked. We'll be right back.
1460.00 1485.00 speaker1  Would you like to hear me play Mary Had a Little Lamb? It was his favorite song.
1483.00 1495.00 speaker3  Are they anywhere close to my size? A 55 on a 45. Oh.
1494.00 1505.00 speaker1  Geralt hides in the closet.
1504.00 1534.00 speaker2  Geralt goes home. Looking at these pants they're actually, they are quite tight as you put them on and as you pull them on they grab onto your leg hairs and pull up and they are basically capris on you. Yeah totally. So now you are wearing capris, no shoes, no socks, and a shirt from... Pump and Dump.
1531.00 1544.00 speaker3  That is correct yes the Pump and Dump. Yeah I'm looking real swell.
1537.00 1589.00 speaker2  So as we said before I wanted to do the investigation of this house very odd and quick moving. To basically lay out the information for you and let you do with it what you will. Basically all of these solo episodes are meant to get the three boys back where they might need to be. The boys are back in contention. And on the fridge you see a picture that catches your attention. It's a picture of your parents. They are posing with silly hats and another man who is begrudgingly smiling.
1588.00 1613.00 speaker3  Jim.
1605.00 1616.00 speaker2  Serendipitously scouring for more information you see a chest cavity of drawers.
1615.00 1618.00 speaker1  You could have just said chest of drawers.
1616.00 1641.00 speaker2  Chest of drawers and open it. Inside is a ziplock bag containing two small items. A single tarot card. It's the devil with several bullet holes in it. Wow. And a taxidermied baby squirrel. Baby squirrel.
1639.00 1664.00 speaker3  Does it have any signature? Of course they do Zach.
1662.00 1667.00 speaker1  The tarot card alongside the squirrel?
1665.00 1671.00 speaker2  It's a taxidermied baby squirrel.
1669.00 1678.00 speaker1  So the baby squirrel.
1677.00 1703.00 speaker3  I believe he is. Can he tell the craftsmanship? Is it Julie Maxwell's craftsmanship? Go ahead and roll intelligence for me. Oh shit. Fuck. It's not a pass. Don't lie.
1702.00 1720.00 speaker1  It's our special little game.
1717.00 1761.00 speaker2  However, as you continue to blindly search for more, you look behind the couch and hiding behind there, you can see a leather holster for a firearm. There isn't a gun, but there is a small bit of text tooled into the leather. Tooled into the leather. Tooled into the leather. And then underneath it, it has a dash and then the letter uppercase K.
1760.00 1778.00 speaker3  It is indeed.
1777.00 1834.00 speaker2  Thank you Taylor. It is smooth and silver with a little plateau on top. It is completely smooth with no markings on it whatsoever. and then where it would be on the top of your finger, it is just a flat plateau. Moving throughout the rest of the house, you see that in the living room with all the papers and binders and stuff all over the place, you see two notebooks that are sitting out. One is leather and thick and it has a symbol on the front you have come to recognize. It has a big circle surrounded by six smaller circles. The other notebook is thin and red and it looks familiar.
1832.00 1845.00 speaker3  That's a pass. That's a 35 on a 45. Alright.
1844.00 1877.00 speaker2  Girthy. Girthy wooden bookmark. Girthy. it is only through death that he may rise again and death is capitalized and he is capitalized.
1876.00 1891.00 speaker3  It's actually weird.
1884.00 1904.00 speaker2  like drawn over it is a picture of a hooded figure with a brilliant light shining from its maw. So all the text is in the background and in the foreground is this hooded figure with this big light where its mouth is.
1903.00 1939.00 speaker3  It's not, no.
1932.00 2055.00 speaker2  As you flip the book back through, you see there's a note stuck in it in between these two pages and it kind of flits out as you go through the book and the book closes immediately. It almost unnaturally, so you can't get to any of the other pages, but this little piece of paper flips out this envelope and inside the envelope is a letter, a handwritten letter. You can see very clearly at the bottom it's signed by Jim Cook. calling it the, quote, scratches of a broken man. The letter then goes on to outline new guidelines, including the immediate reassignment of all members of the disposal unit. the symbol with the circle surrounded by the six circles and it says, faith through knowledge is just called knowledge. hands up, holding up this bag of ice that is still dripping faster and faster red, just all over this house, just red everywhere.
2050.00 2063.00 speaker1  Capri pants, first priority, second priority, blood bag.
2056.00 2078.00 speaker2  Clark, what the fuck are you doing in my daddy's house?
2076.00 2085.00 speaker1  He's the only thing in my life.
2082.00 2101.00 speaker3  Clark is, he might be crying. He might have a tear running down his eye right now and his hands are lowering. Is her gun lowering? Her gun is lowering as your hands lower.
2098.00 2113.00 speaker1  but he wants to show allegiance towards Gerald in this situation. I mean, I'm sorry, towards Clark in this situation. Actually, that was an accurate statement both ways.
2112.00 2137.00 speaker3  You can just call me Maggie now. but still is so slack-jawed. Maggie, I thought you died. I thought you were dead, Maggie. Okay.
2134.00 2145.00 speaker1  so he's sort of like shuffle-stepping forward.
2143.00 2150.00 speaker2  that's existed on this show.
2146.00 2161.00 speaker1  And Gerald has never felt so much warmth and love in his life.
2160.00 2166.00 speaker2  I pull away from the embrace.
2165.00 2191.00 speaker3  Did I see her body? Did I ever see her body? Maggie, I saw your body. You were dead, and saying that out loud freaks Clark out a little bit, so he recoils and gets a little further away from her.
2189.00 2231.00 speaker2  She's not wearing her uniform, and this is maybe the first time you've seen her not in uniform in years. Yeah. And now you only saw, I mean, you saw her five days ago. You were celebrating her birthday, but since then you've already mourned her. But she's just wearing like black jeans and a hoodie, and she kind of walks toward you and walks kind of past you a little bit and grabs the red notebook that was sitting out. She kind of thumps it on one of her hands.
2229.00 2243.00 speaker3  I'm missing, I've got some gaps. I actually don't know how I ended up here at this moment. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
2239.00 2249.00 speaker2  and she pokes at your chest and feels it give.
2248.00 2257.00 speaker3  I lift up my shirt and show her. She steps back.
2256.00 2270.00 speaker2  All right. Clark, I've been waiting a long time for this. I've been waiting a real long time for this. You need to come with me immediately.
2269.00 2290.00 speaker3  Both. Has she acknowledged Mr. Fingersen at all? No. Like, when she said come with me? Was she walking out of the house or somewhere else into the house? No, she was just standing. Clark.
2289.00 2311.00 speaker1  Clark. Now wait just one second. You won't tell us what to do. Clark, what should we do? She's ignoring me right now. Don't listen to her. Mr. Fingersen. Yes?
2310.00 2312.00 speaker3  Clark.
2311.00 2316.00 speaker1  I don't know about this, Maggie. I don't trust her. Listen to me.
2315.00 2332.00 speaker3  I point at Mr. Fingersen. I'm talking to Mr. Fingersen, Maggie. Okay, Clark.
2327.00 2338.00 speaker1  She wouldn't acknowledge that she didn't turn back in because of Winn-Dixie.
2337.00 2340.00 speaker3  Clark.
2339.00 2348.00 speaker1  He knows what's at the mill.
2345.00 2358.00 speaker2  in the world do you keep looking over there for? And she's looking over there too and just in bewilderment, and she's very confused.
2352.00 2365.00 speaker1  Clark, don't you remember all our good times together at the library when I tried to teach you how to read at a first grade level?
2364.00 2378.00 speaker3  Can I touch him?
2374.00 2387.00 speaker1  I want nothing more than to hold hands with Clark.
2378.00 2393.00 speaker2  As Geralt Fingersen holds out his hand to grab yours, you reach out and grasp onto nothing. Fuck.
2392.00 2399.00 speaker3  Clark has freaked the fuck out.
2398.00 2402.00 speaker1  Stay with me. Hold on.
2401.00 2418.00 speaker3  An 18 on a 23. And with that, Geralt Fingersen dissipates. I think that freaks Clark out in and of itself too, that he's now lost the thing that was kind of helping him at this moment.
2417.00 2435.00 speaker1  Okay, I'm done.
2434.00 2440.00 speaker2  Are you here?
2438.00 2444.00 speaker3  Yeah, I'm here. I'm here. All right.
2443.00 2449.00 speaker2  We got a lot of work to do.
2446.00 2451.00 speaker3  I'm going to get some ice and fill up this bag just to be safe.
2450.00 2457.00 speaker2  What's in there?
2454.00 2462.00 speaker3  If there's ice around it, I assume they were trying to preserve it in some way. Frankly, I'm afraid that it's the hole in me, Maggie. Oh my God.
2461.00 2503.00 speaker2  Oh my. And she begins to move some of the ice around. She wants to see what's in there. I let her. Okay, so she starts moving the ice back away and moving down around this metal rod that's in there. It's a hollow metal rod that's in there. She moves enough ice out of the way that you both look down and you see a heart. And when she sees that, she goes, that explains quite a bit. She goes, all right, we're on a time crunch. I'll be in the car.
2502.00 2508.00 speaker3  He's probably only got a couple. He's just got two. He's a normal American.
2506.00 2524.00 speaker2  He's got two ice trays. I throw those in the bag. What would Maggie Cook be driving now?
2523.00 2531.00 speaker3  I think we said a Bronco maybe.
2529.00 2557.00 speaker2  She's in new wheels now. So I'm going to put her in a silver Camry, just a real common car. And as you guys are driving out of the suburbs of the city and what you would know as toward the mill outside on the other side of the city, you guys are in the car just sitting in complete silence.
2553.00 2572.00 speaker3  Clark wants to look in the little canvas bag that's inside the ice bag. I guess next to my heart, next to a heart that I think is my heart.
2570.00 2584.00 speaker2  I feel like it's been inside me. When you grab this canvas bag that is cold and wet and it's got a little blood on it, this is it.
2579.00 2630.00 speaker3  Oh, he just handed me a small canvas bag in real life. Oh my God. I'm opening it. It looks like little tiny puzzle pieces maybe, little pieces of cardboard. Little pieces. Oh, there's letters on the backs. Okay. It's going to spell a word, I believe. I guess I can just tell you as I see them, S-T-L-E-N-R and a symbol. The symbol is a square with a circle in the square. It's a stlearner.
2620.00 2646.00 speaker2  Yeah, in the car you pull this bag out and you look at what's inside and it is these cut pieces of this material with a coloration on one side and letters on the other with a symbol.
2643.00 2696.00 speaker3  It's missing the I though and the I might be the symbol.
2689.00 2804.00 speaker2  It's got some real importance for me and people like me and soon to be people like you. There's a prophecy in there, Clark. And that prophecy is the revelation of the overseer. And what it says is that it is only through death that he may rise again. Well, not only that, we're also fighting on the forefront to keep this world safe from the unnatural that's on the other side. And Clark, I was against it at first and she kind of breaks a little bit and she's much more comfortable now talking with you. And she's like, I didn't I didn't believe in the way things were going and I didn't understand. But now I'm I'm starting to understand a little bit more about how the world works. You know, it's fire that keeps this world going. Most people. But you can. I can. We can. People like us. People in the Circle of Knowledge.
2799.00 2831.00 speaker3  And it sounds like the crazy knowledge, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You were just spouting out at me and you were not there.
2827.00 2915.00 speaker2  The things that you have been dealing with, they may seem large. I guarantee you, you haven't seen anything yet. After driving about 10 miles past the city, you take the country road that leads out to the mill. Trees on either side of the road have grown to meet above, making a verdant tunnel that encases you. A few miles down this road you see a small sign next to a gravel path that leads into the thick woods. The sign says, the mill, on our grind and crushing it. That gravel path leads to an opening where just enough trees have been removed to open up space for a parking lot and a massive brick building with two enormous smokestacks reaching up into the canopy of trees encircling this property. It makes you feel small. The trees must be at least 12 stories tall. And you pull into the mill. There's people all over the place working. They're not paying any attention to you whatsoever. Oh, you are such a wreck! Do you still have this bag of ice? Yeah, totally.
2913.00 2936.00 speaker3  Yeah, absolutely. That makes sense. No. Other than what's happened in the last few days? And then also, do I recognize anybody in the halls? Is there any familiar faces?
2934.00 3115.00 speaker2  You recognize no one in the halls. As you're going through these halls, you go through doorway after doorway that leads you to stairs and then other stairs. And then finally, this one corridor of stairs that's blocked off. She walks up to it and there's a scanner on one side of the door and she clicks a button. And this little thing pops up and she sticks her armpit over it. And then it beeps and it goes back into the wall and the door opens. And you guys walk down these stairs. Everything past here is cold stone and it is a spiral staircase that leads down, down, down. And it is quite dark, but you are led by a flickering light that is coming from the bottom. And when you make it down to the bottom of the stairs, you are standing in a room that you have been in before. And it is this circular domed room that is concrete all the way through. And these familiar slabs are set up where there's one in the middle and there's six surrounding it. As you walk in there, there are already two bodies on each slab. And attached to each of these bodies is a xenonema toad, which is one of those crazy looking, just like this oily, squamous material that is actually this creature that you've seen the mouth of before. And you've seen the razor sharp teeth with the teeth inside of it. Maggie walks you into this room. To get inducted into the circle of knowledge, I'm going to need you to have a quick lie down on this table here. And she points to the slab in the middle of the circle. But the game has changed, Clark. And you're being inducted.
3112.00 3125.00 speaker3  Is it the same number of people roughly in the room? Is it more or less?
3119.00 3357.00 speaker2  The only difference is that the other two people, Leon Simpson and the woman who was here last time, I don't need you to have faith. I need you to have knowledge. And she walks over to the side of the slab and there's this handle in the ground. And you feel it bite in and your vision immediately goes dark. You feel strange, content, satiated in every physical way. It is extremely relaxing, but also weirdly involuntary. Above you is only darkness. In every direction surrounding you, where what could be called the sky meets what could be called the ground, is blacker than black opaque darkness, except for the 12 figures in the distance and the giant black mass. They are all dimly lit from below. You would think they would cast a shadow on the sky above if it was anything more than all-consuming darkness. These 12 figures seem to be following some massive being as they travel away from you. As you move closer, you hear the chanting. It's soft at first and muffled, but these 12 figures are chanting from deep in their lungs. And ahead of them, seemingly made from the darkness that surrounds everything in this place, is a towering, lumbering beast. It walks on two massive legs the size of trees. Its broad shoulders are at least 25 feet from the ground. As you stare, its image seems to form and reform over and over like incomprehensible little glitches. And then it roars. Every muscle in your body tenses up at the same time. All air leaves your lungs. And you begin weeping uncontrollably before you can even hit the ground. Your eyes open and you come to and you are laying on this table. Maggie Cook is putting this horrible creature back into the ground next to you. And she looks up at you and she says, Clark, that thing's coming. And we keep it from coming here.
3356.00 3372.00 speaker3  Yes, sir. Fail. It's a 37 on a 23.
3371.00 3374.00 speaker2  Make it a 2. Yes, sir. How many did you have?
3373.00 3380.00 speaker3  I had 23.
3378.00 3401.00 speaker2  And you didn't roll above your power, did you? No.
3399.00 3424.00 speaker3  That would have been tight.
3423.00 3447.00 speaker2  Okay. She grabs the rod. She pulls slowly. She goes, I know, I know. She lifts it up and then she grabs your heart with one hand and she removes it from the rod like a shish kebab.
3443.00 3454.00 speaker3  I'm trying to get my hand over her hand to stop that sputtering.
3452.00 3611.00 speaker2  Do I have any physical sensation when doing that? Now, I want you to see something. She grabs a small stick from a box in the corner of the room. She comes back and she slowly puts it into the hollow metal rod and she begins pushing it all the way through. And then she cups her hand at the end of the other side and through pops two little pieces of metal. You remember our backup plan for if you didn't come back and finish your last job? You didn't come back in time. Oh. I've tried to take your heart already, Clark. I think you're going to be fine. Clark, you're one of us now. And I hate to do this to you right away, but I've got a job for you. You asked where Leon was. He's on a job. I'm going to send you out on one as well. I send you out. You complete the job. You come back. Most of the time, that's all you need to know. Okay? Now, I got kind of a rough one for you right off the top. But where it's taking place, you are already supposed to be. I need you to go to the funeral today. It starts in, she holds up her watch, starts in an hour. It's at the city cemetery. I heard about, you know, Ari dying in the fire. I was pretty shook up about that. But this does give us quite the opportunity. You see her dad, Stan Manstein, he's going to be out of the city asylum for the first time in a long time.
3607.00 3619.00 speaker3  scares me more than anything that I've ever experienced in my life before. If you're telling me, if you're telling me killing Ari's dad is going to stop that thing, fuck it. Sure. How are you doing?
