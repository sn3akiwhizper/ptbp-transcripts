James, the executive director of Calm Comfy Campground, got inside the dreams or memories of our four PCs. Then they were in a bit of a canoe race. The Grimes took the lead while Jack Russell had a mental break, leaving him and Bradley Cooper at the back of the pack. But before that concluded, the four PCs and Alan Grimes were standing in a seemingly infinite room full of shelves filled with audio cassettes. object made of plastic and polyester type plastic film with a magnetic coating. Most of them hold between 46 and 120 minutes of audio. The names on these cassettes were those of many politicians, CEOs, activists, journalists, religious figures, as well as a group consisting it's about time for these PCs to wake the fuck up. Personally, one of my favorite things in the morning times is dream girl with pretty sexual.
272.10 337.70 speaker2  it's DJ plays the same song over and over and over again. Does that contribute to the town's low sanity? Does the station schedule include a top 40 show and is it no backbone EJV is a dope new song every time I hear him. Brand new premier. out someone still loves you. Boris yells, someone's on a couple episodes and that's
332.22 357.80 speaker3  the Patrion episodes I mentioned a band that I went on tour with free at last. They're fine. Go listen to them. I, when I saw that, I, uh, hadn't listened to them in a long time and, uh, went to their band camp and I forgot that the album artwork is pretty dope by an
351.68 803.68 speaker2  artist from Ozark, Missouri named Tim Peacock who, uh, now works for the new Yorker. Oh a roll off and this is will matter for the game that we're playing. So you're all going to roll off against each other against 50 and if you get under 50 pass and if you all pass, whoever rolls lowest loses. How many rerolls do we get? Go through the rounds and if you, if you roll over feel so strange, like something within you has changed. Like Martin Cupertino is very aware of how his engine runs. And you know, I didn't spend the last 15 years mastering Transcendental Buddhism to not be in touch with my inner workings. But you have so much control that you can keep down anything like strange or painful about how you feel currently. Like you feel almost like, you know, when you're so hungry that you feel like you're going to like pass out. Yeah. down, you see that you have a little bit of dried blood right in the crook of your elbow. Like I'd been hooked up to a, like they were taking my blood. Something like that. Or an IV or something. makes a smoothie. So when you go downstairs on your way to make your smoothie, did you put the into the hole. I need you to roll a D4. What? You just lose one hit point, but you like wang your ankle to the point to where you have to, like, you can't walk quite normally. Well, that's okay. I'm about to do my stretches. So probably work that out. Smoothie and stretches? Smoothie and stretches. Then about two minutes after he actually wakes up, his little digital watch starts beeping and he's it's the last thing I remember being in the room with all the tapes. Vaguely, but it's almost like that memory along with countless others are consistently swirling around in your head. Does physical like inventory of myself. Okay. You said I feel weird. It looks like a needle's been in me. Yeah. How do I feel weird? Do I feel like I've been drugged or anything? A little bit. Like, uh, just a little hard to focus or a little out of it. Okay. So you remember how last night when you were pulling up the floorboard and stuff, you were trying to think of how you got to calm, comfy campground and it like tripped you out that you had no memory of even like the boat ride to getting here or even finding out about calm, comfy campground, all the memories of your friends telling you that you needed to get help seem off in some strange way, how you found out about calm, comfy campground. That memory itself is warped. Roll sanity. Critical success. 22. Wow. Yes. Yes. Okay. So, uh, with that, uh, not only do you know that this is your second day at calm, comfy campground, but you also know full well that it's not. Looks like the world's finally
799.92 832.88 speaker3  catching up to the possibilities of my kind of thinking. I'll have to figure out what the, cube or something, you know, someone gets in a, an online game or really as I don't know,
827.88 956.28 speaker2  enough, everything that you took out of the bag is still with you or where you put it, but the bag itself is gone and everything you left in the bag is gone with it. So you still have the cassettes and the map. I was listening to the episode and I completely spaced the syringe that was in there. Do I feel like that's a possibility for what I out that you were being watched, you kind of think that maybe that memory is faulty because there are no cameras in this cottage. Like turn my TV on, go for it. And flipping around and you see on the inside of your elbow pit, there's a little mark where some dried blood is there.
950.56 988.20 speaker4  we were with the, the floor was made of blight. It was like that scene in the matrix. Oh my God.
980.24 1001.56 speaker2  strange because those memories that are part of your dreams, maybe with Alan having the same dream, you, you, you start to realize maybe, Oh fuck, this isn't, this isn't the second day that
994.60 1109.76 speaker3  you've been to calm, comfy campground. It's not the second day. Something is, but linear timeline I don't, my computer doesn't work that way, so I'm not freaked out. I am alarmed though. Yeah. Can I do a medicine or something like for not first, maybe medicine to feel Alan's pulse and see if his heart rate is normal and see if do like a overall check to see if the not armpit,
1102.12 1194.24 speaker2  city. But when you come back to wheel of fortune, it pops up 37 50 prices, right? Yes. Sorry. I thought you were saying the price was right, which it was 37 59. You said, well, you would have gone different objects around the rooms. And you also find a shoe print that is quite small,
1187.60 1198.92 speaker3  I find those, I'm going to keep them in place as to not arouse suspicion. Sure. Go ahead and
1194.24 1234.76 speaker2  roll stealth to see if you can like find them without, if someone was watching what they
1229.24 1338.56 speaker3  are. Yeah. And I point at like where the microphones are. And I, you do it in a way that
1332.64 1481.56 speaker4  I, I, the ad for calm company campground, it's all swirling. It's all, it's all a part of the if it was a dream or not. If we were actually there when, when I saw Brad piece of shit's name
1474.52 1608.20 speaker2  feel super fucking weird. Like something is off with your body. Like you are a very particular person. You know how you feel. Something is wrong and your arm hurts. And when you look down, there is a little bit of dried blood, like a little mark of dried blood right in the pit of but something inside of you tells you that this is not your second day at calm, comfy campground. and everything on the shelves was made out of styrofoam. It was so terrible. You know
1604.36 1635.08 speaker0  and I got a to-go box and I was carving my name into the top of it. I didn't know. Maybe Thomas yelled, stop, you're killing him.
1627.56 1671.08 speaker2  in high school and a lot of high school theater sets are made using a lot of styrofoam. And one day I was walking through the wings backstage and this massive, probably 10 by 10 foot sheet of styrofoam was laying on the ground and people were hanging up another equally sized sheet and to where it slid across the top. Oh my God.
1667.56 1684.92 speaker0  I don't have this phobia at all, but that kind of got me a little bit. That's a weird
1677.56 1743.64 speaker2  friend Andy and he was running the game and it was a horror Pathfinder game. And he asked Taylor, from underneath the table, he just pulled out two pieces of styrofoam and rubbed them together. No, I know it's kind of weird, but no, I kind of think the Blackwater is cool looking.
1738.60 1750.28 speaker0  outside. When's the first? What do we do next? Are we meeting with somebody?
1747.80 1848.28 speaker2  coming up pretty soon. So you have time to shower. It's all good. she turns back and goes back to the kitchen and you notice that the window in this study was definitely closed and locked last night when you went to sleep. And it's definitely cracked open a little bit right now. And on the windowsill, there's a hair tie with some dark brown hair. flowing mane of curly hair. And she's like, well, I, as you well know, don't live my life
1844.36 1894.12 speaker0  in that chair. That's probably what did it. Yeah. Yeah.
1887.96 2002.52 speaker2  And as you guys are approaching the main house, there's a big like wrap around porch on this hexagonal building in the middle that you like walked up the stairs to go through the main door and standing up there is James wearing the same white dress shirt as yesterday. 10, 11, 12, somewhere in there. And she's got pigtails. And as they see Angela and Roger Fairfield walking up, the little girl gets a big smile on her face and runs off the porch. Go ahead and roll human for me.
1997.96 2039.32 speaker0  can I compare it to the hair tie I saw in my room? Is it probably her hair tie?
2036.68 2333.40 speaker2  You heard what I said, Justin. Gross. The nectar of the man go all over the place. Terrible to the point to where you feel, Oh God, what? Oh, in your arm, like all over you feel weird, but your arm specifically hurts. And when you look down at it, you see that on the inside of your elbow, there's a little bit of dried blood and there's a slight bruise around it. from last night, they're still swirling around, but you can kind of push them down Something's awry. Not only is something awry, feel like you just arrived here. Yeah. Is the walkie talkie on? It still is on. Can I like been moved. Like it's still on your nightstand where it was, but it's not it. Maybe it's like wondering if you've seen Jack Russell, the boat man. You met him last night. Have you seen him uh, no big deal. Not an issue, but, uh, you know, he's not in his apartment, so, uh, maybe just holler. Let us know when you come up. You'll be at the main house soon for another we'll use that search roll and roll it over. You hear heavy breathing from underneath your feet. responding. You can roll persuade if you want to try to like persuade them to talk to you.
2329.96 2361.56 speaker0  up is happening. So I might be worried that something fucked up is happening to this person.
2353.08 2391.32 speaker2  up and he climbs up out of the floor beneath you. Hey, um, and he looks like absolute shit.
2384.44 2450.68 speaker1  girl or something? Talk to me on here at one point last night. And then I fell asleep and I had all
2445.08 2468.68 speaker2  and pulls out a duffel bag and rummages around through there and grabs a syringe out. And he's
2466.28 2489.48 speaker0  to see if I see like a camera placement? Yeah, roll search. Okay. I kind of stare at my feet a little bit. Let's get, ah, fuck. We gotta,
2483.08 2498.44 speaker4  we gotta get out of here. But I, oh shit, shit, shit. Do you mind if I hide out here?
2494.12 2537.96 speaker0  No, no, no, no, no. Something, something bad is happening to all of us here. I couldn't agree more. I don't know what it is, but we, we need to find out.
2528.28 2643.24 speaker2  and Walter and Alan Grimes are all sitting there and the door opens and James comes in and he's
2637.96 2682.76 speaker0  arm yesterday. I hadn't seen it before. I asked her about it. She told me it was, she and I, we travel overseas often. We have to get vaccinations. She told me it was a reaction
2678.52 2816.12 speaker3  a man like Alan thinking anything about me, that doesn't move Martin. You're not actually Alan. I brought you here with me. You're a secret government project from the late seventies. You're a clone of Donald duck and Richard Nixon. we don't remember arriving here. I'm just fucking with them. Do you guys remember arriving?
2809.64 2863.00 speaker2  saying for you, Roger Fairfield, who didn't realize that he didn't know how we got here. you have absolutely no memory of being on your way here or even a boat ride to get to this island.
2858.52 2893.48 speaker3  I think something to keep in mind, we saw the names of a lot of famous people on those tapes, people who've gone out into the world and done things presumably after they've been here. So, you know, just try to keep your head on straight and hopefully we'll get out of this.
2888.28 2904.92 speaker0  Yeah. I mean, we, we had a fight. She said that this would help us.
2900.44 2933.24 speaker2  as being in the canoes or being in the room with all the shelves.
2932.44 2941.00 speaker0  I put a wallet.
2939.48 2954.04 speaker4  Not in general, just on them traditionally.
2953.48 2978.52 speaker3  Yeah. escape?
2972.44 2981.00 speaker0  happening to us. And she's alone with him right now. Roger's going to stand up and start walking to the door.
2980.12 2982.68 speaker3  Hold on. We need to think.
2982.04 2984.84 speaker1  Those tapes.
2983.72 3012.92 speaker0  She wasn't with us. They didn't, they didn't get, get, they didn't get to her. I pass. And do you love her and is she?
3010.76 3028.36 speaker1  And what is actually, how'd you guys meet?
3026.68 3035.48 speaker3  what kind of a look do I get from Alan?
3034.60 3046.12 speaker2  by Bradley Cooper. You'll never know.
3045.00 3067.24 speaker3  Oh, that's my tongue. My like Husky blue eye, blue gray eyes, black. And I am still.
3065.24 3070.04 speaker2  I found the factory reset on this freak.
3068.36 3097.32 speaker0  I think Rogers freaked out. What the fuck? Don't you remember from the dream? He's a mechanical boy. That was an idea you floated out of fucking insanity.
3093.96 3118.76 speaker3  Look, he's just closing really hard. He is a little freak. Maybe this kid's not as smart as I thought. He might not be. Trust me. We're working on that though. It's quiet.
3116.52 3133.48 speaker2  Like after you, as you guys are having this conversation, he's like, well, don't talk about my son. And he clicks underneath your chin. Alan pulls his finger away from underneath your chin.
3130.60 3166.20 speaker3  Okay. That's going to be contested because he's some martial arts expert. 75 on a 70. So as soon as I'm back. Roll a D4. That's a four.
3164.92 3186.60 speaker2  You punch him in the throat.
3181.56 3190.28 speaker3  And then immediately I put my hand on his shoulder and I am not supposed to do that. I am not supposed to do that. Yeah. You're violating your prime directive kid. Cornered, room in at least right.
