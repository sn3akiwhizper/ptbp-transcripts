0.00 8.20 speaker1  Welcome, brothers, sisters, and siblings.
4.40 40.90 speaker0  It's your ethereal pup god, Wolf the Dog. Blessings to you all, my children. And I'm hollerin' from the heavens and the hells at you live from 694.2 PTBP. A station of radio. You know how most companies exclude their employees for participating in drawings,
35.20 89.00 speaker1  Apparently that's not the case here at 694.2 PTBP, cuz this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Joe Terry in Springfield, Missouri, who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod, which is self-promotion when he does it, but it's super fuckin' cool when y'all do it. Hey, dog. so I want you to say Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip Bradley Whitford and Matthew Perry turn in electric performances as co-showrunners of a Saturday Night Live-type program. It got one season.
87.60 161.50 speaker0  Love ya, dog. You will, Joe. Sweet Joe. I love you too, buddy. One day we shall frolic in the slop together as one, but you shall feed me your life force so that I may continue to live on and grow in power. Do not tremble when the darkness fills your vision, surrounding you, when all of your senses start to fail you We will become one, Joe. And you start to think maybe we always were. Welcome back, Joe. The links are in the damn show notes. The news. Last time, the City Action News field team
158.70 223.90 speaker1  across an awe-inspiring bridge that ran over an unnaturally smooth chasm filled with fog and an upside-down church. A pre-recorded Fred Godel from the TVs in the train car welcomed them to Godel's Gate to Grover's Gorge. Through the next Spongebob-y hatch door was a town ripped from futuristic concept art of the 1950s. The first thing Julius wanted in Grover's Gorge was an interview. And while they talked to a great employee of the Godel Company, a GE of the TGC, they noticed hopping along the synthetic track they all stood on, a jackalope, taking you back to this mythical critter.
219.90 262.00 speaker0  And it's all my fault Cause my life is great And it's all mine Cause my life is great And it's all my fault And it's all mine
258.10 266.90 speaker2  You are now listening to what I think is probably episode 7. Mr. Joe Terry, tell me what's a weird dream that you've had?
265.90 273.30 speaker1  Yeah.
270.20 299.70 speaker2  Oh, I mean, there's one I've remembered for some reason since I was a kid. Awesome. I'm running down the hillside and it's like the Windows XP background, like beautiful lush green hills and beautiful clouds, and I'm leading an army of giant ants toward like a hole at the bottom of the ground. I'm not an ant, no, but I'm like running fast and it's like joyous. Like it's not scary or dangerous or anything. We're like a stampede of giant ants running toward it.
298.30 302.10 speaker3  It's like the most joyous dream I've ever heard of.
299.70 322.10 speaker2  Yeah, that's so cool. I don't know if that's weird though. Where are we at? What are we doing? Are we in the normal world? Are we just like hanging out at the news station? No, man. Are we in the city?
318.30 340.00 speaker3  No, we're out on assignment and shit is not normal, Zach. We're not in the city. We're in Walmart country. surrounded by impossible geography,
339.10 351.30 speaker2  answers for the people. So, uh, Luke, can you describe the landscape in which you are standing currently?
350.90 365.50 speaker3  Nice. Got it. Nailed it. You can describe the city in one word. I would say weird. The landscape weird. The people weird. It's a huge space age city with bouncy colorful synthetic walkways. Awesome.
364.70 368.90 speaker2  Nice notes. Very good notes. Do you have luck right now?
368.50 369.70 speaker3  Actually.
368.90 375.40 speaker2  You have luck now.
374.70 385.20 speaker3  Joe's like, what the fuck?
384.20 400.20 speaker2  Do you guys remember, um, Dave Coulier hosted a show that was kind of like America's home videos, but it had a Jackalope. Do you remember this? You're thinking of Bob Saget hosting America's home videos. Are you throwing us off because Thomas took good notes? Oh shit.
399.40 424.10 speaker3  No, I have no, I have no recollection of this. Coulier time. Um, I'm going to start taking notes once I use my point of luck. Just when you thought it was safe to check the mailbox,
421.80 430.00 speaker2  and it's just a rabbit that they've tied horns to and they do bits with it. It's a real dead rabbit. It's like a taxidermy rabbit that they've attached horns to.
429.00 434.60 speaker3  That's awesome.
430.10 443.40 speaker2  the one that you guys are looking at here in Grover's Gorge is alive and it is just kind of hopping on this synthetic walkway
440.90 448.90 speaker3  where is it between us and the massive square park? nice.
448.70 456.10 speaker2  Oh, you can't have more than just luck, but I'd give it to you again. Ooh, I'd give it to you again. Oh, no, no, I just want,
455.20 465.30 speaker3  I just want your praise.
460.60 485.10 speaker2  in either green or yellow tinted or accented uniforms. What's on the other side of that park? I bet Joe knows. Is it two big statues? It is two big statues. Yeah, they're about twenty six point three meters tall. In fact, and they're made of green rock.
481.20 495.30 speaker3  labs? Yeah,
491.30 505.50 speaker2  It rhymes ass. Brass.
502.00 509.90 speaker3  Ass glass of grass.
508.20 524.00 speaker2  you see housing, beautiful, beautiful,
522.10 527.00 speaker3  what do you think that to the left is? What would you say those buildings look like? I don't know,
526.60 565.00 speaker2  what are they? They're all unique to each other though. They all have their own special flair to them and they're enough apart to where you think it wouldn't be an issue to like hear your neighbors or anything. There's definitely privacy. And so those are to the west. Those are to the west. If you came from the south, Headin' west like you're blowing Kanye. Oh,
563.30 568.50 speaker3  nice.
565.00 571.30 speaker2  Childish Gambino line for you there.
569.80 574.60 speaker3  You should have just said it was yours. I thought it was yours.
572.30 608.80 speaker2  I'm Donald Glover. Donald Glover. Oh, dong lover? Okay, you would assume you're not sure how big they are proportionally based because you're just too far away to make out the subtleties of these statues. However, you can assume based on the enormity of the statues that the dongs might have a similar weight to them. Interesting.
605.80 612.40 speaker3  The dongs weigh as much as the statues or at least a similar amount. They've got dense dongs.
609.90 623.00 speaker2  The dongs take up. What? No,
620.50 626.10 speaker3  So two giant dong statues.
624.90 639.90 speaker2  They're big penises. Men. They are two men. Are they doing anything?
639.10 640.70 speaker3  Yeah.
639.90 690.80 speaker2  Are these the Godels? These are these the Godels. The one with the hands on the hips is Frank Godel Grand Granddaddy Godel. Which is his son. Yes, Fox and Faith Fox and Faith Godel. dude. Some people do that.
690.00 693.20 speaker3  That is correct. Yes,
691.00 696.90 speaker2  according to the story told on the train.
693.20 700.60 speaker3  Some people name their kids mostly like their sons like the same name. It's fucking weird as hell, dude.
699.50 804.50 speaker2  Must be confusing. I would never name an NPC with the same name as another NPC. No, You're talking to Jennifer who is from here. She's a GE. She's a great employee. She said for the Godel company here in Grover's Gorge. She was born and raised here and has worked for the Godel company for a few years now. She's in her like early to mid 20s. And now the corner of your eyes, you all noticed a Jackalope kind of hopping across this bouncy walkway that others are exercising and jogging on. Some people are paying it a little bit of attention, you know, And you see that it has a yellow ribbon tied around its head around its antlers. Cal says, Woo woo yeah go GE's hungry for points. And she kind of like motions with her hand to a couple others and they all kind of run around and make a circle around this Jackalope that's sitting on the ground and they hold each other's hands and they go, I'm a GE of TCG. Well, so as as they're like doing that,
803.60 856.80 speaker3  Definitely doing that. Yeah. No, sorry. Yeah. So I thought you were saying oh my god. I knew you were just fucking up.
855.10 873.30 speaker2  Thank you Thomas.
871.10 897.10 speaker3  So I'm like you're hiding something from us you fucker. Julius is definitely recording on his phone like trying to get up as close to the Jackalope as possible. Is it does it seem scared?
896.10 900.70 speaker2  No, not at all.
897.90 907.40 speaker3  What are you guys? What are you guys doing? I've asked the people around the Jackalope.
905.50 947.80 speaker2  Oh, hey, what's up? Oh, hi. Hey, how's it going? Uh, oh, yeah. No, we're just celebrating our points. Hey hungry for points. Oh, do you eat Jackalope?
946.10 955.80 speaker3  Why you are all wearing yellow? Why is it got a yellow ribbon? What? What?
955.60 998.40 speaker2  Yeah. No, so the Jackalopes, they run free and they're not actually Jackalopes. That's so sad. The points is the best part.
997.40 999.70 speaker3  What do the points are in you?
998.40 1004.00 speaker2  Of course I get ahead of myself. I'm just so excited and happy to be here.
1002.00 1010.60 speaker3  Well, Jennifer, we can certainly see that.
1008.90 1041.20 speaker2  Win what? Oh, the prize at the end of each quarter, there's a prize. The fiscal quarter? Yeah, of course. What is the price? I'm sorry, EEs? Those are the green ones and she kind of points around and you see some people who are wearing the same like similar really nice kind of athleisure. But their accents are green as opposed to yellow, which is what? What does green sound like? What?
1039.80 1069.30 speaker3  Their accents are green. Like Ireland.
1067.60 1165.40 speaker2  But do you like have a say in it? No, it's just kind of where you fit. Yeah, the excellent employees work in the lab and the great employees work in the factory. she points to the top of a massive greenhouse that is peeking out above these cake pop like trees. You know how I assume you guys all work together? Well, then you're probably very close to your co-workers and less close to people you don't work directly with, right? No, I mean, not not like as a rule. Wow, that sounds really hard and sad.
1164.40 1182.50 speaker3  I'm just fine. We want to know more about you, Jennifer, and what you do here.
1174.90 1211.00 speaker2  monochromatic with green accents, approaches your group confidently with a hand outstretched. What a coincidence indeed to run into you here. My name is Fox Godel. I am the son of my father, Fred Godel, the grandson of my grandfather, Frank Godel, It's an absolute pleasure to meet you.
1209.30 1222.80 speaker3  Like does he go into the real world? Oh, great question.
1218.20 1235.60 speaker2  where he's just like posing on a sound stage with his dad just within the past year. How old is he?
1231.00 1236.80 speaker3  How can someone have a monochromatic outfit with colorful accents?
1235.60 1286.60 speaker2  Oh, well that's easy. It's just like white, gray, a few different shades of gray, black, and then has like green accents on the side. Not monochromatic. It's pretty, it's pretty. Gray scale. Gray scale. Okay. Gray scale. Monochromatic gray scale with green accents. he looks up at you, notices the headphones on your head and immediately his eyes glaze
1284.12 1288.60 speaker3  Was the last person that did that a farmer? Yeah.
1287.60 1291.40 speaker2  He was.
1289.60 1292.40 speaker3  It was the lemon or just some other guy.
1291.40 1306.52 speaker2  It was. It was the ticket guy. It was actually, it was Jesse Lemon. Okay. It was the farmer who sold his property to Fred Godel.
1305.30 1312.60 speaker3  at at the farm? You even took them off and stuff.
1311.60 1337.00 speaker2  Yeah. I need everyone to real grip as the look of this man who was just completely normal a moment ago as clearly gone somewhere else inside of his own mind and is trapped seemingly with the disturbing. The lonely stoner seems to free his mind tonight.
1334.00 1339.00 speaker3  Oh, I crit failed too, dude.
1338.00 1358.40 speaker2  It was an 88. Oh, that's right. You just spent your luck. No, I made it 99. It was and it is.
1357.40 1367.40 speaker3  No, I made it 9.9. Oh.
1362.40 1370.40 speaker2  Beck Wilder, Cal Colorado, you're going to lose two grip each. Well, that's not so bad.
1368.40 1380.40 speaker3  Because we saw his face. It was the headphones that freaked him out.
1376.40 1416.20 speaker2  Yeah, that's what's freaking you out is that now you've run into a second person who has had the same reaction to your headphones. It's simply just... It's wrong for someone to be scared of a headphone. And then not only that, but unnaturally with the snap of a finger. But there is no snap of any fingers. going in for a handshake. Nice. What the... What was that?
1412.20 1422.20 speaker3  I don't shake his hand because I've now critically failed this grip loss. I think that he... Awesome. What are you doing? If you fail grip, you can't shake his hand.
1420.20 1425.20 speaker2  That's the rules. And he kind of...
1423.20 1440.20 speaker3  You awkwardly grab too soon and grab his fingers. And maybe I go up like, is there something on my neck? And then I feel the headphones.
1439.20 1456.60 speaker2  What's going on here? You know, he pokes you in the belly a little bit. Uh, Julius, like... Like Tife. Definitely... Yeah, like Tife.
1455.60 1458.60 speaker3  That's not a cool thing to do.
1456.60 1469.60 speaker2  I guess we just had a couple... Is Taylor...
1466.60 1474.00 speaker3  but enough that he wants to like address that... But I would like you to...
1472.00 1485.00 speaker2  Because you just failed, you didn't critical fail, I'm going to let you roll an alertness check here. But again, because you did fail that check, you're going to be at a negative 20.
1482.00 1490.00 speaker3  A 32, which makes it a 52, on a 70. Fantastic.
1486.00 1519.40 speaker2  If I could have Thomas and Joe remove their headphones in La La La, but don't La La La, because you're in the same room. her eyes are welling up with tears as she's staring into the face of Fox Gothel
1516.40 1522.40 speaker3  Like, do I recognize that it's from his...
1519.40 1527.80 speaker2  I mean, he's doing a real weird fucking thing here
1526.80 1541.80 speaker3  And then you're back. Julius looks at Fox. What was that... Stevie?
1540.80 1605.60 speaker2  It's nice to meet you. He puts out his hand and is like, And you. So what is your name? Why did you have that look on your face? So sorry if it was too charming for you. It's just pure terror is across and you can just see his lips quivering. His eyes are kind of like darting back and forth. He's not looking even at the headphones anymore and just as soon as you notice it, he's done. But because this just happened and you kind of have a bit of a grip on yourselves this time, the two of you, because you didn't roll alertness last time, you get to roll alertness this time, but because you critically failed last time,
1604.60 1619.00 speaker3  I rolled a hundred. I rolled a one. Okay.
1617.00 1625.00 speaker2  because I don't know what to do with you.
1623.00 1644.40 speaker3  So, fuck. Zach, can you take your headphones out and rub your ears? I don't want to have to change shit if we get it right, but I think people are getting Clockwork Orange here. Like, God has some kind of device. Headphones are a major part of it. Yeah. So I'm sure he's done it to control his son. He did it to convince the farmers to sell to him.
1643.40 1648.40 speaker2  I like that idea.
1646.40 1665.40 speaker3  because they seem kind of aware of themselves. Yeah. Do they have to put ear drops in? Zach? did you feel like you were back at the big boy show? Oh, dude.
1663.40 1678.80 speaker2  Yeah, but my heart wasn't thumping to the point of actual anxiety. Absolutely rattling my chest cavity.
1676.80 1682.80 speaker3  when you're fucking 10 years old and you get to go to a show.
1680.80 1687.80 speaker2  It was absurd. And we were so close to the front. It was fucking awesome.
1686.80 1695.80 speaker3  I had never felt this before, but when I would breathe in through my nose, I could feel it vibrating. It was so weird.
1693.80 1706.20 speaker2  So the story behind this is that I was sitting on my couch on Saturday and Luke calls me and says,
1704.20 1712.20 speaker3  I was about to edit, yeah. I'm like, okay, you're going to Bentonville with us to see Big Boy and Run the Jewels.
1710.20 1722.20 speaker2  And then he said he'll be at my house in 10 minutes. So I hung up and changed clothes and then we drove to Bentonville and watched Run the Jewels and Big Boy. It was fucking sick as hell.
1720.20 1744.60 speaker3  It was incredible. That venue was pretty cool too. No, it sucked. Walmart sucks. Walmart does suck. The vans were great. Well, it's confusing.
1742.60 1789.00 speaker2  It's extremely confusing seating, Joe. It's so confusing. you and Luke take your headphones off here. First off, Stevie is staring directly into the face of Fox Gottel with just this wild sadness. Just this deep Her eyes are welling up with tears. So much so that the wall is about to break, but the dam stays and no tear actually rolls down her face.
1787.00 1793.00 speaker3  How old is Stevie? Stevie looks
1791.00 1823.00 speaker2  her late 20s, early 30s. Okay, what is the second thing I see? It's what you remember. You remember but it's like a little piece of trivia that you remember. Probably from reading the news. Or even saying it. Exactly. Literally saying it on the news when Fred Gottel had his second born child
1821.00 1833.00 speaker3  but he turns around and looks at Stevie and he mouths Faith? Her eyes
1831.00 1843.00 speaker2  Fucking Gottem.
1841.00 1859.00 speaker3  most of the time it was but my finger slipped once and I heard Thomas go MOUTH!
1857.00 1873.00 speaker2  you were rubbing, it was just like so
1871.00 1899.00 speaker3  this alertness role and it's because all Beck's life he's been a goofball and in response to that is disappointment and maybe some disgust sometimes when he's like a slob. To see himself elicit like carnal fear in somebody he's like what the fuck? There's something wrong with me all of a sudden. I'm broken. Right. Holy shit.
1897.00 1913.00 speaker2  squishing the rabbit underneath your feet and falling directly on the antlers impaling your upper thigh.
1911.00 1915.00 speaker3  a fucking crit fail.
1913.00 1921.00 speaker2  Holy shit. You lose four
1919.00 1929.00 speaker3  Get a doctor. Mr. Gothel.
1927.00 1957.00 speaker2  oh right a doctor right. Damn it man. Move. Thankfully someone else comes up it's one of the people in yellow athleisure comes up and is like out this device out of their pocket and it looks like a futuristic like Star Trek speaker system it's actually you know what it's um they're called tricorders in Star Trek. Okay no I'm not
1955.00 1961.00 speaker3  going to do that. Does it have like a big talkie grill kind of thing? Yeah it's
1959.00 1967.00 speaker2  got a big talkie grill on it it's like a 60s like little oval
1965.00 1969.00 speaker3  wah wah wah wah. Yes exactly.
1967.00 1985.00 speaker2  Like a CB radio thing. Yeah almost like a CB radio and she grabs it and immediately we're on the track yeah we're
1983.00 1987.00 speaker3  Foxgoddle is walking away with
1985.00 2013.00 speaker2  his hands in his pockets while whistling uh go ahead and stop the bleeding here so Beck you're not going to bleed out. Oh thank god. So you get this rush of relief over
2011.00 2021.00 speaker3  oh god Julius my man
2019.00 2023.00 speaker2  what this does for him. Just one. Just one
2021.00 2043.00 speaker3  get one hit point back oh that's good very good okay very nice
2041.00 2045.00 speaker2  over here that's that's not
2043.00 2055.00 speaker3  not true at all no man I mean like
2053.00 2075.00 speaker2  people don't normally talk to me like that that's strange interesting yeah no uh you seem fine but if you still need a doctor or whatever that's fine too
2073.00 2079.00 speaker3  10 minutes but like dude
2077.00 2103.00 speaker2  I suppose we should uh wait for the uh medical authorities and elsewhere okay roll grip you you almost expect it this time and all just like roll your eyes at each other
2101.00 2111.00 speaker3  from the ground Beck is trying to get uh Stevie's attention
2109.00 2143.00 speaker2  water yeah you got water no but I bet can you uh and there's someone passing by who is holding water as they're jogging they see the headphones and their mouth goes slack jawed and they just kind of like phase out of existence like their faces they're just like oh and then their face is completely normal and they're like
2141.00 2179.00 speaker3  god dammit could you excuse us for a moment uh Julius you you better come over here once we're all like kind of huddled up with Stevie I say uh Julius Beck I'd like you to meet Faith Godel shut the fuck up shut
2177.00 2189.00 speaker2  but he changed his name did he change his name or did your father
2187.00 2213.00 speaker3  in your ears and wiggle them around a little bit we're trying to talk over here laughter are you the one who told us about
2211.00 2221.00 speaker2  what's going on okay
2219.00 2225.00 speaker3  job what's the job finding the pen
2223.00 2233.00 speaker2  this and then we have to get it out of here
2231.00 2251.00 speaker3  and I look at the
2249.00 2255.00 speaker4  Beck looks to Cal
2253.00 2273.00 speaker3  gopher we've ever had on this crew thank you can we trust these people with our Beck is he safe in their hands in their medical care yeah he'll get the best from Beck sure yeah I don't
2271.00 2277.00 speaker4  think that'll be a problem Beck is looking
2275.00 2291.00 speaker3  slurring even more than he usually does wrapping paper ribbon laughter
2289.00 2295.00 speaker1  like it is into like their like
2293.00 2311.00 speaker4  once you're there it seems like you'd have access to a lot of things like hospitals are like centrally located in most
2309.00 2317.00 speaker3  get out or were the Godel children
2315.00 2323.00 speaker2  when I think when um I think that's when Greg got got
2321.00 2329.00 speaker3  it to himself and then makes eye contact with Stevie and then
2327.00 2333.00 speaker4  yeah
2331.00 2339.00 speaker3  what's the deal with the food on the train why can't any outside food
2337.00 2359.00 speaker4  all amped up on caffeine before we got in it's uh you can't have any caffeine or drugs in here all the stuff that they have doesn't actually have caffeine in it it's just like if you have caffeine be able to get got
2357.00 2385.00 speaker3  Beck is gonna be bulletproof here he drank like 40 of these so the people here are all under some kind of control I punch him in the face
2383.00 2391.00 speaker4  actually yeah literally I just
2389.00 2395.00 speaker3  earphones like away from his ear
2393.00 2415.00 speaker2  when he comes to you guys are like walking and we're whistling Fox comes up and he's kind of talking to you guys and you see that the medical staff has arrived and they came on a bowl pen cart yeah dude hell yeah
2413.00 2421.00 speaker3  are they wearing green
2419.00 2461.00 speaker2  Beck situated on this on this stretcher kind of situation comfortably sitting and they begin walking everyone kind of down the trail along the west walkway up toward the lab toward the north side alright well do any of you want to come see I'm very proud of it I think we'd have a good time you don't want to stick around and deal with all this medical nonsense and I've got a pool I've got a hot tub

2465.00 2489.00 speaker2  my Godel innovation zone yes of course my GIZ yes of course the best thoughts come in your GIZ I can take credit for that I believe I dreamt it as a child and made a drawing that my father made a reality that's rad
2487.00 2495.00 speaker3  seeing your GIZ? we are gonna
2493.00 2507.00 speaker2  alright I'll take the I'll take the old rain check if you're gonna be nice about it I don't much care for that one and he points at Cal
2505.00 2531.00 speaker3  the medical emergency of our co-worker you tried to refuse a medical service and now you seem to want to separate us from our friend now I assure you I could be very nice to you and very beneficial for your business if we perhaps get the message you want on the air but you have to talk to us first why don't you come
2529.00 2535.00 speaker4  film the interview from the bed
2533.00 2543.00 speaker2  okay you got me there and he continues walking alongside

2545.00 2559.00 speaker2  of course I do very kind
2557.00 2597.00 speaker3  and one of my favorite things I think I've ever written in my notes is I fell on a jackalope it's not at all what I expected to happen tonight I fell on a jackalope Beck fell on a jackalope is honestly someday how I expect to hear that actual Beck died holy shit where do Scientologists go when they die hell
2595.00 2633.00 speaker2  who is kind of turning the corner she's coming from the lab statue area right turning the corner heading down the walkway toward you and you see that she is a pencil of a woman with bouncy spiky hair on top of her head
2631.00 2643.00 speaker3  I'm imagining a number two like bouncing down the road fresh shape
2641.00 2657.00 speaker2  is just like yeah just gonna running though back from whence she came so wait wait
2655.00 2661.00 speaker3  did she just come towards us and turn around
2659.00 2711.00 speaker2  turned the corner saw you guys immediately started running in the opposite direction and Fox is like oh Barbara off to go run and see her old husband probably freaking out that he didn't meet you guys at the gate huh Chuck Bidwell and Barbara Bidwell Barbara was running off like that she's kind of his keeper I suppose
2709.00 2721.00 speaker3  he's been rolling this whole time Mr. Gottle what would a city manager handle here do they handle taxes
2719.00 2735.00 speaker2  yeah they would handle all sorts of business sides of things but of course taxes because of course you pay our employees in
2733.00 2741.00 speaker3  US dollars
2739.00 2753.00 speaker2  I'm a bit of afraid to say I don't know the answer to that question I am a bit more of the hang out in my GIZ and kick it kind of guy
2751.00 2763.00 speaker3  do not pay your employees anything
2761.00 2807.00 speaker2  ahead he says see uh commissioning it a gallon of milk god I don't know um pffff seven seven seven dollars is everyone here guess that's what you might call vegan yeah pretty rough move when he came in there Beck stepping on an animal like that that's uh
2805.00 2817.00 speaker3  fell on a jackalope Beck yeah cool
2815.00 2831.00 speaker2  I think he killed it it was at least
2829.00 2835.00 speaker4  killed an animal before
2833.00 2867.00 speaker2  to the front here and it's a sight to behold this is a massive glass building taking up the whole north side of this park square and in front of it massive 26.3 of this green rock and up close you see an immense amount of detail hey Zach would that happen to be 69 feet
2865.00 2871.00 speaker3  I literally just did the math in my head at 78.9
2869.00 2879.00 speaker2  did the math because I was like that's probably
2877.00 2907.00 speaker3  footage of Godel just being just incriminating Stevie a little more discreet it's a really rad dolly shot there it's a walk and talk
2905.00 2923.00 speaker2  yeah it's a total walk and talk down low angle Joe loves his sorkin and as you guys are walking down at the very end you see a
2921.00 2927.00 speaker4  pterodactyl
2925.00 2933.00 speaker3  oh god
2931.00 2943.00 speaker4  purple ribbon
2941.00 2949.00 speaker3  is there a purple team? Fox you notice kind of runs over
2947.00 2985.00 speaker2  puts the ribbon in his pocket and then starts walking away from you all back toward where you came from kind of toward where you he's kind of pointed at his house he's just kind of walking away whistling with his hands in his pockets once again at a negative 20 to see if you can throw a pair of headphones and I assume you grab
2983.00 2993.00 speaker3  you grab Bex
2991.00 3019.00 speaker2  and you throw them without unplugging them from the cord at all and they just kind of immediately Fox turns around as he's whistling and he's not looking he's just yelling over his shoulder you said continues kind of whistling
3017.00 3025.00 speaker3  and one of the people walking
3023.00 3037.00 speaker2  and then they notice the headphones on the ground and they're like
3035.00 3043.00 speaker4  Bex calls after Fox also no interview then or
3041.00 3053.00 speaker2  you guys are now walking past where there's this rabbit just kind of hopping along with a spare pair of antlers
3051.00 3059.00 speaker4  I'm sorry about your brother my man
3057.00 3071.00 speaker3  oh yeah I was talking to the rabbit straight up was like dude the rabbits talk right

3097.00 3103.00 speaker2  yes
3101.00 3115.00 speaker3  am I right? between Kyle Colorado and two EE's do you feel like you're better than the great employees?
3113.00 3121.00 speaker4  it's different
3119.00 3139.00 speaker2  they point at one of these dope houses inside this futuristic mid century modern house that wouldn't happen to be the home you were born in would it? how long have you been in Grover's Gorge? gosh like five years?
3137.00 3149.00 speaker3  what's your salary? if you don't mind me asking a million dollars
3147.00 3158.00 speaker2  kind of now and this oh like the golf carts
3156.00 3166.00 speaker4  we've been in that the whole time yeah you've been walking him down
3164.00 3204.00 speaker2  it does a nice little slide into stairs where it's got kind of rails that land down on the stairs to where it can slide gently up the stairs and you're walking up the stairs and all of the stairs that you're walking on are grass grass stairs leading up and then this like small grass field in front of this beautiful glass building and on this grass the hogs? they're like well I mean how many feet did you say Luke? 78.9 yeah that's like seven stories tall real quick these things are tall
3202.00 3216.00 speaker3  the grass stairs where people have traveled up them or is the grass worn away
3214.00 3224.00 speaker2  not at all and you see a woman who is walking out of the lab currently in full judges robes and a powdered
3222.00 3230.00 speaker3  wig atop her head hey that's from the thing oh yeah
3228.00 3234.00 speaker4  she's wearing a
3232.00 3240.00 speaker2  heels no green or yellow
3238.00 3246.00 speaker3  like a real world judge and no gaudel corporation trappings
3244.00 3254.00 speaker2  perhaps the powdered wig might make her not so much look like a real world judge or like I'm sorry British yeah are you aware of
3252.00 3276.00 speaker3  the commonwealth nations? I'm not idiots yeah they look like buffoons and those fucking buffoons send you away to prison the lawyers wear them too straight up this is what they look like oh my
3274.00 3286.00 speaker2  so exactly like real world judges oh my god these guys look so silly as she's walking out I need everyone to roll humans please I'm sorry she's walking out
3284.00 3302.00 speaker3  of the factory the lab the lab pass ooh hard pass with the three I failed a
3300.00 3312.00 speaker2  surprised I didn't have you rolling a negative
3310.00 3316.00 speaker3  adrenaline has started to wear off a little bit
3314.00 3320.00 speaker4  you look back and my eyes are closed
3318.00 3324.00 speaker3  who is this judge?
3322.00 3344.00 speaker2  the eyes of this judge and Stevie meet
3342.00 3356.00 speaker3  to somebody else's eye couldn't you? yeah you can it's not feels weird we'll try it later
3354.00 3378.00 speaker2  making eyes right they lock and you notice a strange look come over the judge's face but because you know who Stevie is you see a look of recognition on the judge's face as she looks at Faith Godel Stevie is
3376.00 3384.00 speaker4  she knew where I was
3382.00 3394.00 speaker3  she work for? the Godel Company what is your relationship to her?
3392.00 3506.00 speaker2  maybe not nice she serves as some kind of you guys are walking through these glass walls there's seemingly no door but the walls kind of lift creating an opening in the whole front of this building and allow you to walk through Cal says on grass inside stairs but suddenly there's an incline of the same synthetic pathway that you saw out on the track and that incline synthetic pathway takes you upstairs so basically you walk up and then you flip a yay and you're facing back the way you came and there's another huge wall of glass that you're looking out and up against that glass there are three stools with this glass backdrop and it faces back the way you came looking out through the glass wall into the beauty and enormity of the park at the city center of Grover's Gorge and on the far stool perched on its plastron which is the belly of a turtle is an extremely old looking common box turtle its head flippers and shell are covered in scratches and scars and it looks damp a makeup artist is attempting to powder it dry while holding the turtle steady by its Cal reaches a hand out to the normally, pretty small, yeah so it's like a big box turtle, okay
3504.00 3552.00 speaker3  for everybody at home he was putting his hands about this far apart, like the size of my head that would be terrifying, how long do box turtles live, oh forever never born though, neither were box turtles, whoa are not born, and do not die of our lord and says they're right on the wikipedia, dude in the bible, box turtles actually look fucking insane you know, like a big wheel with eyeballs
3550.00 3556.00 speaker4  turtle its shells instead of eyes
3554.00 3560.00 speaker3  box turtles generally
3558.00 3574.00 speaker5  but some have been known to survive for um, eternity
3572.00 3576.00 speaker4  waiting room, but then the turtle was
3574.00 3598.00 speaker3  getting its makeup then I thought they were maybe disrespecting us very hard you want to interview, here's our employee of the month boxy
3596.00 3610.00 speaker2  well I think you'll be doing the interview up here and we can just have the medical staff come up and meet you they're based in this building, so oh wait, the interview with mr
3608.00 3660.00 speaker3  oh, with the mayor, mr bidwell no, the mayor
3658.00 3664.00 speaker5  and Neil Armstrong? and Ryan Gosling
3662.00 3672.00 speaker3  which is about
3670.00 3688.00 speaker5  ew it's not very good
3686.00 3692.00 speaker3  you know that really old one
3690.00 3704.00 speaker5  there's no plans that I can see but there's an article that says the fly continues to make a strong
3702.00 3704.00 speaker4  can I get 30 seconds to sound? oh
