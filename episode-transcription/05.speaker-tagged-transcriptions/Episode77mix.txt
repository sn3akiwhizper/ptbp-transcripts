0.00 18.18 speaker0  Greetings, Dream Babies! It's your sleepy daddy, Wolf the Dog, and I am here to snooze 18 hours a day and eat garbage for the six waking hours.
14.52 29.50 speaker1  Well, I try to catch up on my math lessons.
23.70 61.50 speaker0  the only radio station that definitely penetrates your sleep brainwaves even when the radio is turned off. This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Ain't Slayed Nobody, a new actual play podcast playing Down Darker Trails, the Old West setting for Call of Cthulhu. They done gone and tagged that pretendin' pod in a tweet, ya hear? That's some Western talk for you cowpokes out there. They write,
58.30 68.64 speaker1  Think of the subscriber counts before you answer.
66.80 116.80 speaker0  when we earned this announcement. We have some things in common, We'd sure appreciate anyone who lets us bend their ear for an episode or two. Now listen here, bub. I don't do anything I do for some kind of subscriber count.
115.04 131.56 speaker1  But I digress. The Old West.
129.98 243.90 speaker0  Or a future one. I have been all places at all times at some point, I am sure. I wish I knew what the fuckin' internet was so I could see a goddamn podcast. Disclosure and money. Wolf the dog has an odd relationship with money. Paper money is crazy and I don't understand how nobody uses it. But coin money? take on a legendary house in Call of Cthulhu's The Haunting. Caleb Stokes, lover in the ice, a delta green favorite that gets nasty real quick. for part two of that game in the next few weeks.
236.86 268.84 speaker1  you want to see how the sausage gets played, patreon.com slash pretending pod.
264.00 305.42 speaker0  They saved an old woman from a freakishly long limb creature in a black suit. Wow, that's nice. Then she died. co-worker, Jim Cook. Realizing quickly that Keith was not Jim, the creature tried to get some info, but due to the lack of perspective, mostly just fucked with them, knowing it was going to wipe the memories of the past week at the end of the encounter. But did our beloved heroes allow themselves to be brain mopped? Abso-fucking-lutely not.
301.90 392.46 speaker1  And then Drew Andrews pulled up.
387.08 396.46 speaker2  except for he's not, I am a dirty liar and I love him so dearly and I miss kissing his face. Oh boy. Face.
395.46 403.48 speaker1  Me.
398.60 431.00 speaker2  I wanted to start today with a quick game where we try to kiss each other's faces. everyone to answer on like 3, 2, 1 you say us or you on who wins a roll. So who wins if I roll a 52 on a 50 and you roll a 51 on a 60? 3, 2, 1.
430.00 436.44 speaker3  Yes, nice.
432.00 438.44 speaker2  And if I roll a 0, 7 on a 40 and you roll a 45 on a 45?
437.44 451.90 speaker3  Us.
450.90 470.60 speaker2  What happens? Unless it's a 1. Unless it's a 1. I've got one last one for you. If I roll a 0, 1 on a 10 and you roll a 69 on a 60?
469.60 479.88 speaker3  Us. I don't know that one. And it trumps all of these?
478.72 486.88 speaker2  No, does it trump all others? It trumps a 1?
485.88 492.88 speaker3  It's the crit.
489.68 504.68 speaker2  You all did very well, almost perfect.
503.68 532.16 speaker3  The Hamburglar. their awards. I was trying to remember a scene in New Hope where they were like quizzing each other on numbers. I couldn't come up with that scene.
530.56 569.68 speaker2  He freaks out. Drew.
558.80 614.40 speaker3  You see, Kevin was Marvin Glass's main enforcer along with Rosemary, but he was actually the Oh my god. This is John. I'm John, yeah, I'm John, and I'm in this body now. I... Yes, he did, right? I don't understand.
605.36 618.80 speaker2  been through a lot with you guys, and he did, in fact, witness the Cat Man switching bodies, so this is, um...
616.16 620.80 speaker3  He can roll with the idea of somebody being in somebody else's body. I like what you're saying here.
619.80 644.64 speaker2  A little bit better, yeah. He's gonna be able to slightly understand that, and so John Lee Pettymore the fourth is in the body of John Lee Pettymore the third, and your body is, where's your body?
639.48 659.40 speaker3  You know what, we can get into all this later, I don't really know if we have time to explain ball to you. What's contention like?
651.88 708.20 speaker2  Okay, so contention is working still, yes, of course, and we're working on puddle teaming everywhere, so basically what we gotta do- to come get you so that you can come back to contention and help, because you are the only police officers that we had, and you all abandoned us, and I wanted to come find you and bring you back so that you could help us, thank you so much for doing that, but Whose idea was this, Drew? Did you organize this, Drew? Oh gosh, no, it was Pastor Adam Cain, it was Pastor Adam Cain that did that, and he's taken over.
707.20 721.24 speaker3  Did you call him daddy?
715.60 746.00 speaker2  pretty wrecked, right, and so we needed a leader, and Pastor Adam Cain is taking care of everyone at the First Creek family at contention, and so everyone is there, and that's how we're staying safe.
745.00 782.38 speaker3  relevant leads. We're professionals, Drew, you should know this by now. Yeah, we were just doing our jobs, I mean, we eliminated a couple huge threats to the town, Marvin Glass won't be sticking his weird looking face in our business anymore, for one, cause he's dead, or maybe he's not dead yet in this timeline, but he will be due to our actions in the past. You haven't seen us since we left contention, right? No? Okay, good. Don't worry about it. We'll explain all of this on the way back to contention.
780.50 795.38 speaker2  Have you, has your phone been off or something? Oh, I, and pulls out a burner, and is like, sorry, I had to get a burner cause I got wet.
791.98 802.22 speaker3  You said, you said that you got this puddle teaming thing going on, and you got people who are jumping into puddles if they see the ooze. Are you able to see the ooze now?
799.50 823.78 speaker2  No, no, we use kids and crazy people. Kids can see the ooze. Yeah, maybe that was just a bit too much tell, not show, but yeah, we use kids and crazy people to do it because they can see the ooze.
820.60 837.42 speaker3  those details. So kids and crazy folks, huh?
833.70 857.58 speaker2  but these puddles are everywhere, you know, it's really good. residue will move away. We're trying to come up with a solution.
855.14 860.22 speaker3  Well, people have been through worse, Drew, you know.
858.66 907.46 speaker2  Throughout human history. Then being hunted by an unknown ooze that most of them can't see unless they're crazy? Yeah. the safety measures taken have been very good, but what we are trying to do now is get back to a sense of normalcy and we would appreciate having the police officers of contention help us in that regard.
904.02 923.94 speaker3  I walk over to the passenger's side and get in. on ideas. Have you or Pastor Adam Cain come up with any ideas that seem viable so far?
922.94 936.02 speaker2  It's fine. You know, it's just, anyway, what was the question?
930.46 956.14 speaker3  Have you developed any idea about how to maybe vanquish the ooze once and for all?
949.26 976.98 speaker2  So I wasn't there, but apparently a fish can like gather the residue, it like sucks up into it, basically into its mouth and then you can squeeze it out. To what end? Oh, to get rid of it. I mean, if you needed to put it all somewhere, right, so we're just kind of collecting fish that have it.
972.50 979.70 speaker3  What you're saying is the pastor is collecting all of the ooze in one place?
976.98 986.46 speaker2  Oh, yeah, I guess you could say that is what we're doing.
985.46 987.46 speaker3  I don't know.
986.46 1029.30 speaker2  I'm not there. I don't like the sound of that. point or going to zero.
1028.30 1035.94 speaker4  Yeah, you picked that up real quick. That was good.
1033.10 1042.34 speaker2  Hey, Drew, did you ever get that cat carrier we sent you off for?
1038.94 1045.34 speaker3  Hey, have you been spending your money?
1044.34 1049.34 speaker2  No.
1048.34 1054.34 speaker3  Hey, the feller we sold it to. He's dead. Yeah. The Duke is dead?
1053.34 1057.34 speaker2  It was Keith's brother. The Duke was Ferguson Beans?
1056.34 1077.66 speaker3  And Keith killed him. Okay. Montage. Road trip montage to contention.
1076.66 1088.38 speaker2  bag. Do you guys have all those with you?
1084.62 1109.90 speaker3  We've got a plan that eventually our past selves are going to pop out of the ground and then we're going to go and get them. So don't worry about that. Thank you. Say that again. How much time do you reckon we have to get back to contention? the city? Does he have the bag too?
1108.02 1110.90 speaker4  Marvin's got that bag too, huh?
1109.90 1164.90 speaker3  So yeah. I mean, if you think people could, uh, you know, puddle it out for another 12 to 18 hours say, and until we can just stroll on into that glass compound, which will pretty soon be, be ruined. seats and watch it happen again, if you think we can, we can spare the time. I mean, do you need us back in contention by this evening or can we, can we wait until, you know, maybe we get the gun and the camera and then hit up a diner and get a nice like What's that?
1159.52 1170.44 speaker4  I'll just show you then to explain, but we need to go back to my, my hotel first and it'll make a lot more sense.
1169.12 1200.84 speaker3  Oh shit. to contention? Okay. Here's what I'm going to say.
1193.16 1232.94 speaker2  However, the most important thing is that you guys come back with me to contention. I will say though, if we do wait, contention will be a different place when we get there. will have changed, maybe even escalated if we were to not handle it currently. Sure. Sure. If we were to go do something else.
1229.74 1246.66 speaker4  And this whole fish thing collecting the ooze. The pastor rubbed me wrong the first time I met him anyway, so.
1245.26 1301.06 speaker2  What a wise man. thanks is due. No matter which body you're in, I think that you of all people would understand that what is Drew Andrews' money is Drew Andrews' money.
1299.90 1308.32 speaker3  And forceful for you, Drew. Drew, have you ever branded somebody a fool?
1305.14 1315.62 speaker2  You've been gone for one day and like, I know we said the whole thing, but you think I started branding people with my newfound fame and fortune?
1313.52 1325.30 speaker3  I'd like to human this.
1324.30 1327.58 speaker4  camera help us much down there. Yeah, we don't really know how to use them.
1326.30 1330.88 speaker3  I think we should get down there, do what we can first. Do we have one name left on us or two?
1329.88 1338.46 speaker4  We got two. We got Tildy. Okay, so this isn't- And uh, Drew?
1337.46 1340.06 speaker2  You guys have my name on you?
1338.46 1356.06 speaker3  Two contention to wrap it all up. Keith was just about to say, Drew, you're uh, it's so great that you came and got-
1353.04 1360.38 speaker4  have to explain on the way, but we got names written on us.
1359.06 1367.62 speaker2  No, no, no, no, no. Oh, you got Tildy?
1366.62 1371.14 speaker3  I mean, it sounded like- I, I interrupted myself.
1368.62 1387.40 speaker2  Do you even know what you're talking about, Keith Vigno?
1385.02 1406.66 speaker3  He could just be repeating what we said, bubble gum tree. Tell us something Drew Andrews would know.
1405.66 1409.94 speaker2  No, everybody knows that.
1408.94 1416.54 speaker3  This was a sting, Drew.
1415.42 1423.06 speaker2  I thought they knew. I'm just messing with you, Drew.
1421.06 1429.58 speaker4  What's your cousin's name? Emmett. He's the EMT.
1428.58 1433.74 speaker3  Okay.
1429.58 1453.62 speaker2  If you're still wondering who I am, Keith Vigna, thank you very much. I went and picked up a cat carrier to go take a cat that had the soul of an FBI agent inside of it. So maybe don't question me. Okay. Okay.
1449.46 1469.70 speaker3  Well, if he is fake, he's a very good facsimile, so.
1467.66 1470.70 speaker2  Who has the best humant?
1469.70 1489.90 speaker4  I have 80. Check that out. It's a 79 on an 80. Oh, nice.
1486.90 1508.74 speaker2  Drew is acting strange, obviously. That's why you questioned him on it, but he definitely skipped out on the question of how he knew where you were.
1507.74 1512.74 speaker3  Unluckier-less. Unluckier? Luckless.
1511.74 1539.50 speaker4  No, I'm gonna kick you out. Hey, Thomas.
1535.74 1545.50 speaker3  know if this Drew can be trusted.
1542.78 1554.26 speaker2  John Lee Pettymore as your... Sorry. John Lee Kevinmore.
1547.50 1561.58 speaker3  What I have on my character sheet is Kevin John Pettymore the third. But I think John Lee Pettymore the third works too.
1559.92 1790.22 speaker2  John Lee Pettymore the third. Well it's the body you're in currently, but it's back when he was still your daddy. You recognize the face from pictures. The reflection is poor, clouded and gray. It's a television screen. Then the television turns on, and you see the empty interior of the contention police station. And it's a mess. It's a wreck. There's water that's been splashed all over the place. There's files just like riddling over the floor, over everything. It's where it's in the state that you last saw it. And the channel changes. You see Jim Cook in an abandoned gas station briefing three familiar faces you recognize from a file in Marvin Glass's compound as a team called K-Cell, comprised of this young John Lee Pettymore the third, aka Kevin, a man called Kyle, and Karen, which is the alias of Anne Love. As the three are leaving this derelict come and go, you see Jim Cook calls Karen back real quick to have a word in private. Back in the disheveled contention police station, Drew Andrews leans on a two-tiered plastic cart as he pushes it towards the evidence room. He punches in the code, enters with an empty cart, and rolls on out with the radio on top and the helmet on bottom. And that helmet is sitting on the briefcase that you know contains Drew's cut. Five million dollars. The channel changes, and you see Drew pushing this full cart up through the sanctuary of the First Church of Contention, which is hard to recognize with all of its pews removed. And the TV turns off, click. screams. She's holding these two people at gunpoint in their own hallway just to the right of you, and they refuse to tell her what she wants to know. it? A few freckles? screen. into the man's mouth while forcing the woman to watch. Karen's eyes light up as she begins chanting in some tongue, either ancient or alien, and this couple begins rising slowly, steadily off the carpet.
1789.22 1800.74 speaker3  Yeah, you've seen- Is it Clark's parents? It's Clark's parents.
1795.14 1827.00 speaker2  You've seen their picture every day for a while sitting on Clark Bishop's desk. Your vision shifts completely to a close-up of a man's left hand. Blood is flowing down from his forearm and dripping from his fingers, and you see Drew
1814.06 1845.68 speaker3  Andrews lean into frame and kiss the ring on this man's hands, bloody fourth digit. What I'm getting from my question, can we trust Drew, is no. Did Keith say he was in the front seat or the back seat? Front seat. I'm going to say I am directly behind him.
1844.68 1872.36 speaker2  Do you want me to bring the other two back? All right, John Lee Pettymore III is 10 luck lighter as his eyes immediately come fluttering back into reality, and he looks to his left and sees Clark Bishop in the back seat right next to him.
1871.36 1883.32 speaker3  Are we driving right now?
1877.04 1887.80 speaker2  shotgun with Drew Andrews driving this red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse.
1883.60 1893.52 speaker3  I've seen it before, and it led to good things, so I just let it happen.
1892.52 1894.52 speaker4  point.
1893.52 1927.20 speaker3  He's doing the thing. Remember? He was able to like see things last time. And then he's back. I'm so sorry, but I really have to pee. This old body, the bladder isn't, you know, not as strong as I'm used to. I'm still adjusting to the new Corpus, so, uh, could we, could we pl- I just, I'm about, I'm about to piss all over your car if we don't, you know, pull over right, right, right
1925.64 1936.44 speaker4  That really freaks Keith out.
1931.84 1961.12 speaker2  don't work the same way that we used to, and, you know, you're not as trained in knowing when your body needs to go, but I ain't gonna need you to maybe just like hold it because as you well know, there aren't any gas stations in between the city and contention, it's only an hour drive.
1960.12 1989.76 speaker3  Please pull over, Drew. Oh, Drew, please pull over, we don't want that. These guys have some bad memories about an old man shittin' all over the place, it'll probably make them barf all over the car. It's just because of the memories, though. Even if we just find a field or something. I will go shit in that long grass, I swear to God.
1987.52 2009.88 speaker2  Uh, yeah, I'll drive you. He sees this like little country road that's going off, little gravel road. then is like, hey, do you think here is fine?
2006.96 2015.88 speaker3  You're next to a cornfield, but it's December. Perfect, perfect.
2012.04 2031.76 speaker2  So it's just flat land that you can clearly see through.
2028.12 2045.04 speaker3  To that end, uh, John steps hard on your toe. Oops, John, you got me on my foot there. John gives, gives Clark, like he, he stares daggers at him.
2043.20 2046.68 speaker4  As soon as I see that, I pull my gun on Drew too.
2045.04 2054.72 speaker3  All of our eyes just got so big. Clark doesn't pull his gun right away and is startled.
2053.08 2056.60 speaker4  Oh, John, John, John, fellas.
2054.72 2066.50 speaker3  Put it in fucking park, Drew.
2063.64 2076.24 speaker2  Drew takes the keys out and hands them to Keith.
2072.28 2078.60 speaker3  Clark, Clark, you get out too and you keep them covered.
2076.24 2085.44 speaker4  As soon as he's out, I want you to put them in handcuffs. This ain't our Drew. Money changed.
2083.92 2088.20 speaker3  Clark has gone ahead and starting to get out.
2086.84 2106.50 speaker2  I answered all your questions. I don't know why you don't think I'm me. It happened all the sudden. John, I mean, you're not even John, what's going on? Hold on just a second.
2105.68 2108.34 speaker3  Murphy's barking at the door. He's barking at the door.
2107.34 2126.98 speaker4  That's what it means.
2125.58 2134.02 speaker3  Get on him, Clark, cover him. I'm doing it.
2132.76 2149.06 speaker2  but I would really thank you to not do whatever you're about to do. Drew. Drew, stop talking.
2145.26 2161.68 speaker4  and I'm saying, Drew, I'm sorry, but I got to trust my partner here and I'm cuffing him.
2159.72 2216.00 speaker3  I don't like having Drew in handcuffs. This isn't right. I know, he knows it too. Ever since I came back into this body, but I can see moments from this sphere in which I did not participate. And the past. This time it was just the past the helmet, and all his money from the evidence locker and gave it to the church. And then he kissed some creepy bloody hand with a ring, a wedding band on its finger. So Drew, my question to you is why did you take those items to the church? I mean, it's simple really.
2214.72 2243.00 speaker2  then they have all the power and people who have all the power have the ability to make other people do things that they may not wanna do and I was one of those people who was made to do something that I didn't wanna do. They said that I could be saved. I could have my life, I could be safe if I brought these things and so it was my only option.
2241.80 2260.58 speaker4  Oh, Drew. Me? Yeah. 38 on an 80. You all can.
2259.70 2274.46 speaker3  I lost my dice. Yeah, if you just wanna say numbers, that's fine.
2269.46 2289.90 speaker4  When I dropped my dice earlier, I couldn't find it, so. I've just been winging it. Three on a 50.
2288.06 2307.22 speaker2  between a rock and a hard place and had to make a decision and this is the call that he made. What? Drew.
2304.26 2314.94 speaker4  Is there any visible torture on his body?
2309.94 2327.62 speaker2  There is a ring of blistered skin on his stomach, on his round belly.
2326.22 2332.50 speaker4  The pastor did this to you?
2329.62 2345.50 speaker3  You do that thing where you heat up a container of rats and they try to escape by clawing through your belly. And Drew just pukes.
2343.62 2349.82 speaker2  Vomit splashes on his feet.
2347.22 2355.02 speaker4  This is just sad.
2352.18 2367.68 speaker3  I mean, I think we can keep him with us and not fear for our safety, but maybe we should keep him detained until we know the full extent of the hold this pastor has over him. it might be a good time to make sure
2366.10 2383.90 speaker4  I get out of the passenger seat, I go over and I hug Drew, but then I pat him down after I give him a hug.
2380.06 2422.50 speaker2  It is a little damp and it's been rubbed on something that is like red or like dark red. Basically looks like a tiny piece of cheap carpet that's been dipped in blood. Drew- But maybe not dipped, but just like a little bit rubbed on it. Drew, come on. In this car? Drew.
2421.26 2437.98 speaker4  43 on a 50. Just tell us what it is. You know we're just trying to help. We're the good guys. Are you still a good guy, Drew? I don't know if you are.
2434.94 2447.70 speaker2  Do you remember what happened to the town of contention while it was under your watch? It was under your watch too, Drew. Everyone. People lost their animals, people lost their families.
2446.30 2456.06 speaker4  Drew, you know as well as us that we did everything we could. We were working the case the whole time.
2453.56 2467.50 speaker2  Didn't talk to anyone about anything. Didn't let the public know what was going on. Didn't respond to any calls. Drew, we responded to every call we could.
2466.02 2478.06 speaker3  that we were ill-equipped and had none of the resources we needed to face a full-on reality-shattering catastrophe.
2475.64 2482.36 speaker2  that you've ever come across in your life?
2480.36 2491.80 speaker3  is this some kind of magic talisman that the preacher's using to control you? Yes.
2490.96 2495.76 speaker4  Good work on that.
2493.52 2504.28 speaker2  It's not what it is, thank you very much. You can just say something and then it's true.
2502.76 2543.56 speaker3  Something's wrong with you. Something in you is not you. Okay. We just, or not the gun, you know, the Adams. Yeah. Sorry about the whole rat thing. So what have I done wrong? We need you, yeah. We need you to tell us what this is.
2540.56 2548.68 speaker2  Hand me the, just put it in my mouth.
2547.52 2564.12 speaker4  What do you think, fellas? I mean, he's cuffed still. What are you gonna do if I do that?
2561.84 2588.20 speaker2  will make us like be cool, cause I don't know why you put me in handcuffs all of a sudden, like I haven't done anything wrong. So if this'll make us cool, then I'll just tell you the truth about this. I didn't wanna blow your minds or anything, but just like you asked earlier about how I knew where you were and this is how I knew where you were. So tell me like who you wanna know where they are and like what they're doing or something and put that in my mouth.
2586.08 2594.88 speaker3  the nature of this item? I believe you, you don't have to demonstrate. Why don't you tell us exactly.
2593.64 2599.66 speaker2  Thank you very much.
2598.82 2603.26 speaker3  and how you came across it.
2600.70 2619.36 speaker2  until I almost die and I go unconscious a little bit and I see where whoever I'm thinking about is.
2618.22 2625.12 speaker4  and says Tildy.
2624.06 2633.28 speaker3  You gotta shove it in there,
2630.78 2643.18 speaker2  This seems like something that someone should draw.
2638.88 2661.12 speaker4  opens his mouth up, shoves the carpet in there, closes his mouth and says Tildy B.
2658.26 2670.94 speaker3  Hold on, Clark, you gotta let him nearly die. as he's choking?
2669.50 2684.94 speaker2  Yeah, he's just choking. Is he handcuffed behind the back or in front? I said behind earlier, yeah. So he gets down on his knees and-
2683.78 2687.30 speaker4  I'm kinda helping him down.
2684.94 2758.08 speaker2  Okay, yeah, and then help him onto his side. That's what he's trying to do. That's what I do. And he's just choking, choking, choking, shoots out of his mouth, and the carpet only comes halfway out. It's mostly just blood he spits out. Carpet's hanging out of his mouth, and he starts chewing on it a little bit. Tilly B. Mitchell is in a dark container. It seems to be four walls made of some sort of material that she cannot get out of, and I couldn't really make out everything that was her whole deal, but she didn't seem to be tan. It was very, very pale.
2755.92 2773.64 speaker3  What's Jay Leno doing right now? Shove it in there, shove it in there. Let's see what old Jay's up to. I bet he's driving a car.
2771.06 2792.06 speaker2  and John Lee, Pettymore the Third. I mean, you think we give a shit and basically torturing him. He's crying on the ground right now. I mean, Keith did that.
2790.72 2803.56 speaker3  It's not like it was unexpected.
2802.50 2828.16 speaker2  This hits you so deep. You feel like all at once you're like, oh, I could have stopped Keith from doing that. And we could have asked Drew if we could have made it more comfy on him somehow or at least gotten him out of cuffs before we got him like choking violently on the ground, gasping for air, unable to like see any future for himself in that moment.
2825.04 2834.64 speaker3  while we tested out the magical item with only his word for what it did. I think that's super fair.
2833.08 2845.16 speaker4  I failed my roll. That makes me hit my breaking point on the dot.
2842.66 2861.20 speaker2  I'm gonna get Thomas and Luke out of here. Bye. So you're gonna roll a D100 three times while I pull up the core rule book for Call of Cthulhu seventh edition.
2859.80 2885.08 speaker4  a 98, and an 89. Also to calculate breaking point, it's your sanity minus power.
2882.80 2924.52 speaker2  and a phobia on the second one. All righty, Joe, you rolled a 56, Oh my God. Is it fish? It's an obsession with fish. Yup. Pretty much. Just to hit the other ones, 98 is typhlomania, which is pathological blindness. Okay. And then scribblomania, obsession with scribbling or doodling, that would have been good for.
2922.96 2932.32 speaker4  If we didn't have a fish thing in there, we could have had that.
2930.84 2938.04 speaker3  The way that I should play this though,
2934.68 2943.86 speaker4  Like I don't have to like seek out fish from now on, right?
2942.22 2986.18 speaker2  if you would like to. Maybe if Clark Bishop, oh, I brought them back too soon, but otherwise you don't need, yeah. Thomas rolled over his power, did Joe as well? Okay, so as Drew spits some more blood out of his mouth, he's kind of like leaning up as Clark Bishop is like helping him up. I think maybe even losing the sanity, like helping him up even quicker, like, oh shit, what have I done kind of thing.
2985.34 3002.44 speaker4  Yeah. I want to pull it out for him. Thank you. That was awful. That's a worst case scenario deal right there.
2999.74 3018.12 speaker3  and it looks like he's trying to pull his own head off. and it just starts like it's fading a little bit in the distance. Keith watches that for a couple of seconds
3013.52 3026.72 speaker4  Drew, who else did the pastor make you look for? hollering after him.
3023.16 3037.92 speaker3  You see John like trip over a golfer hole or something out in the field and he just like eats dirt and he slowly gets to his feet and he kind of like, he looks back and he shakes himself off.
3036.46 3041.62 speaker4  You're all right over there?
3040.78 3058.26 speaker3  I'm all right. It's just a consequence of body swapping. Sometimes, you know. Kind of like why am I here, who am I, you know, what's going on, what's.
3056.98 3061.06 speaker4  It's all good, it's all good, it's all good.
3058.26 3095.52 speaker3  But if you're saying you're okay now, that sounds good. You see his arms like twitch and try to pull his head off like seemingly one more time. Then he flops him around like spaghetti and takes a big, big breath of air. And he pats his legs and like dust himself off
3092.92 3135.26 speaker2  just to find you. It was you mostly. Me. And as he says that, you see a flurry of movement in the distance. Far beyond John and Clark, both walking back through the field, there's a barn and a dark blur is whipping around from behind it, Drew no longer sees any of you. He is only gawking eagerly at this frenzied black lab making its way toward you all. His big ass gums flapping about in the brisk If nobody knows, nobody knows.
