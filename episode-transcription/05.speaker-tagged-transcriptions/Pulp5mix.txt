0.00 23.00 speaker0  Greetings and salutations, my pack. It's your hellacious howler, Wolf the Dog, and I am shoutin' at you live from 694.2 PTBP. My screams can be heard no matter where you are,
20.26 38.98 speaker1  That's how radios work, I think.
35.26 84.78 speaker0  They tweeted about the show and tagged at PretendingPod. They write, Thank you all for your excellent show. I cannot wait to see what season two brings. the best friends to play an RPG with. We here at PTBP love it when you make something you love
81.94 154.18 speaker1  Just ask all of my friends. sittin' in this studio for all time with only my producer and dog, Wolf the Dog. I definitely don't long to share a warm garbage parfait with another under the flickering lights in the parking lot of the long-abandoned supermarket called Cream for Less. The stars and moon cast in an otherworldly glow upon our yogurt-covered claws and maws. Yeah, I definitely don't care about none of that. tag at Pretending Pod on the Internet or write a five-star review on Apple Podcasts and holler at us about it. Say it loud to the person on your left, at Pretending Pod. at Pretending Pod.
150.52 162.94 speaker0  Say it out loud to your fest-drenned Brad,
159.94 169.94 speaker1  Last time, Lafayette J. Honeycutt
167.14 225.94 speaker0  with his Fuck Yo Gravity machine. It scuttled across the top of the building toward him as he failed miserably including a burning timber that drove checkers down and in a downpour of good luck, Honeycutt blasted the flying monsters with a jetpack fart to the face and flipped down next to Harvey and checkers with ease.
223.94 231.94 speaker1  electrical discharge,
229.94 241.94 speaker0  of these twisted winged beasts with pulsating crenulations across their jagged heads.
238.94 327.44 speaker1  And now, for the first time, a brand new song here for 694.2 PTBP. a body could be hollow I didn't know that the wind could soak the tissue and faggot bone. You were hollow and you spoke to me. Hollow and you sang. I thought you might be starving, so I gave you everything.
323.44 359.94 speaker0  Jesus wept. when our Sunday school teacher didn't have anything prepared for us on Sunday morning, and Bible trivia was a game that was like, you know, Trivial Pursuit, whatever, is in a box and so we'd bust it out and play. And the question was, what is the shortest verse in the Bible? And my friend's younger sister said, enthusiastically as anyone has ever proclaimed any two words,
357.94 373.44 speaker1  Jesus wept.
371.44 381.44 speaker3  just to wipe them away. Just smudge them a bit. Yeah, from back to front too.
379.44 388.44 speaker0  Yeah, and they didn't have bidets back then, so, ugh.
386.94 451.94 speaker2  if you don't have a bidet, we're not living in Jesus times anymore. You can get one. They're relatively inexpensive and it keeps your butthole happy. Brought to you by, I'm Googling bidet company. that wasn't like, just like Bomba socks or whatever every time, it would be cool if we were just exclusively sponsored by a bidet brand. Today only, if you type in the code PTBP and then delete it off there, you can buy, if you buy two bidets, you can save $90 at Tushy.com. And if you use Honey, it'll probably help. Our Jimmy John's came, Scott.
448.94 474.94 speaker3  Your sandwich place is called Jimmy John's? Jimmy John's, yep. Oh, Jimmy John's. Oh, sorry. I thought you said Jimmy John's. I was expecting it to come with flavor aid. The Jim Jones. Is this going to be like some special Patreon content where it's just like eating sounds for 10 minutes?
471.94 502.94 speaker2  So we literally have to split off in our very first episode. There's a doorbell that rings like four minutes into our very first recording. Jimmy John's just showed up at the door and Luke went to the door and the guy was like, what are you guys up to today? And Luke was like, oh, we're playing a role playing game. And the guy was like, oh, sweet. Have you ever heard of Delta Green? That is what we're playing.
501.94 504.94 speaker0  Brilliant.
503.94 522.94 speaker2  You should listen to this thing that will come out in two years. Well, that guy was Joe.
520.94 526.94 speaker3  Take your time. I don't want to see any of you choking to death
524.94 527.94 speaker2  trying to catch the game in a hurry.
526.94 529.94 speaker3  It's a horror game, Scott.
528.94 545.94 speaker2  Psychic attack! Yeah, I'm ready to go. Fantastic.
542.94 548.94 speaker3  and then we can move on to the death?
547.94 555.94 speaker2  Oh, man, yeah. Luke really betrayed me.
554.94 559.94 speaker3  I don't know what happened at the end there where he was first aiding you after having shot you.
558.94 586.94 speaker2  I know, it's wild. Well, I was pissed that I could feel you betraying me in real time and then I didn't want to kill you, but I had to stop you psychic attacking me. I'd like to read something from the psychic attack part of the Pulp Cthulhu handbook. Okay, I can. Sounds like you're making it up already. I'll read the whole thing then, I guess.
584.94 593.94 speaker3  It says that I can.
591.94 635.94 speaker2  The psychic may attempt a psychic attack if the target is in line of sight. If the initial opposed power roll is failed, the psychic hero may attempt another power roll If the second attempt fails, the target of the attack can never be targeted again by the same psychic. as like two psychic attacks back to back in one combat. Okay, so then I've done it once. So if I do it again and fail, then I'll never be able to psychic attack you ever again. And then that would restore my trust in you.
633.94 642.94 speaker3  Yeah, so don't think of it as a psychic attack. Think of it as an inoculation. Right.
639.94 676.94 speaker2  Oh, and if I fail, it works like a pushed roll. So something suitably bad happens. Possible consequences might include bleeding from ears and eyes, sanity loss and instant delusion, incapacitation by shaking and spasms, et cetera. Nice. Yes. Anyway, that could be bad, huh?
674.94 688.94 speaker3  with the two of you down there in the cellar, patching things up both figuratively and literally?
686.94 750.94 speaker2  I'm not sure what any of it is. I don't know what the invention is. I don't know what that thing was. I don't know what you're trying to get me to join. as much as I can do right here, but... I'm feeling much better, thank you. There's got to be a doctor. Hey, I want you to know, just because you're no longer my master does not mean that we cannot be friends. Huh? I can teach you the ways of this creature, and you can learn. But I'm in charge, though. Assuredly, but you can learn from me. Hmm. and you're not making no sense.
747.94 759.94 speaker3  you can start hearing all the screaming and crying and strange, you know, crashing sounds from outside.
756.94 780.94 speaker2  and he's like, hey, they're missing us out there. Right. I help you walk up the stairs, and we'll head out of this horrifying dungeon.
778.94 802.94 speaker3  you'd heard all the chaos as well from deeper within the building. What are you doing? Yeah, absolute panic. You've got to get out of here as soon as possible, and I mean, you know where the front door is. I mean, you know, if you just run out of there, I'm sure you'll be fine.
801.94 809.94 speaker4  I'm charging ahead.
807.94 816.94 speaker3  just legging it down the corridor full speed away from him.
815.94 817.94 speaker2  I started with 13.
816.94 826.94 speaker3  You didn't know that?
823.94 831.94 speaker2  He's done that in, like, the same direction that the creature just flew off, basically?
829.94 838.94 speaker3  Yeah, he's running towards the chaos.
835.94 841.94 speaker2  and then closes the door behind him and locks it. Like, while you're in the room?
840.94 851.94 speaker4  Yeah.
847.94 877.94 speaker3  largely consists of blood-splattered furnishings, blood-splattered bedding, blood-splattered carpet, blood-splattered corpse, the syringe and the strange liquid, blood-splattered ceiling, blood-splattered light fixtures.
875.94 926.94 speaker2  or cabinets and find, you know, is there anything in his bedside table, any super sentimental knick-knack that I can take to just really rub in the world's, you know, You would know. Ego. Yeah. I see that, and I look at it, and I kind of toss it away, and I see, like, propped up next to the bed is that stupid self-playing violin, and I take that. Yes. And I...
922.94 943.94 speaker4  And I look at the weird, you know, the stuff he was injecting. And I pocket that as well. Okay. And then are you two running up those same stairs out of that wardrobe? Yeah, I think at this point the two of them
941.94 956.94 speaker3  Well, hello, chaps.
955.94 975.94 speaker2  Yeah. Did you see it fly out of there? He's fucked up because he's thinking that that thing's his master, but I am.
972.94 977.94 speaker4  Just like everybody down there.
975.94 981.94 speaker2  It's going to change the world, you know? Also, the last branch, you should get in early
979.94 984.94 speaker4  because it's about to take off.
983.94 986.94 speaker2  No. No.
984.94 1007.94 speaker4  God damn it, no. He did take off in his amazing jet pack. I don't know who that is, David. Whoa! The whole time? Checkers recalls, he's like,
1005.94 1016.94 speaker2  I've seen him in the magazines. I am the best inventor. You're the second best inventor on Earth?
1013.94 1021.94 speaker4  Well, and then I see him.
1018.94 1023.94 speaker2  I was the best before.
1021.94 1026.94 speaker4  I made this kick-ass jet pack.
1025.94 1071.94 speaker2  Alive? A jet pack! that followed through with the energy focus in order to make you the successful man without any sort of rival to speak of? and show off could change the world, you know? I'm like, eh?
1069.94 1073.94 speaker3  you'd have to lick it.
1071.94 1086.94 speaker4  Yeah. I spread a little flame out the back. Just revving the engine, just a little. Huh?
1084.94 1098.94 speaker3  I think with all the blood and tissue around,
1095.94 1104.94 speaker2  and figure out what the hell's going on out there.
1100.94 1111.94 speaker4  and dying out there, so what if we just stayed in here? That was sort of my plan.
1109.94 1123.94 speaker2  No, wait for everything to leave. They know we're up here. It seemed like it just wanted to get out of here.
1121.94 1126.94 speaker4  I shot him. Sorry.
1125.94 1130.94 speaker2  I think I'm going to be protected. Split up.
1128.94 1136.94 speaker4  Okay, you take care of him then,
1132.94 1151.94 speaker2  Wow, he's going to be deeply unsafe now. or any of its friends, so of course, yeah, that seems fine. Perfect.
1150.94 1154.94 speaker4  and report back to me. Yeah, I'll let everybody know you're up here.
1153.94 1198.94 speaker2  I kind of shuttle you out the door after. No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't do that. Well, in order to make sure that tonight goes off without a hitch, everyone should know where everyone is.
1194.94 1238.94 speaker3  and you were going to head to the exit, but now that you're on the stairs, you're beginning to come out of this panic and you can see that it is carnage down below. There are people running around all over the place and there are a number of these flying creatures buzzing through the air around them. A few of them are holding these devices that look a bit like cameras maybe. The people are terrified. Some of them are trying to get outside. You can see there are a few bodies on the ground. People are getting trampled. What do you do?
1236.94 1252.94 speaker4  Notice me. What?
1249.94 1319.94 speaker3  There are some of these creatures buzzing around, but nothing seems to have taken a lively interest in you yet, At the moment, you're mainly looking into the hallway and you can see about half a dozen of them here, but there's sounds of buzzing from outside. You hear some strange crackling noises from out there as well. And there's pandemonium in the ballroom as well. The band, funnily enough, has stopped playing at this stage. silhouetted by the light from Gordon's room.
1318.94 1335.94 speaker4  Yeah, it's easy to see that. Let's just go back and lock ourselves in that room.
1334.94 1341.94 speaker3  I can't take them alone. I don't think four of us can take them either.
1339.94 1358.94 speaker4  You saw that thing that came out of the cellar? I shot it. There's a lot of those.
1356.94 1380.94 speaker2  Where did this voice come from? So I don't really even have an actual voice.
1378.94 1430.94 speaker3  Unfortunately, it sounds like it. So while you're having this conversation, you see Margaret Payne running pursued by one of these creatures. Another one of them wields this camera-like device and seems to be trying to point it actually in your direction. But this bolt of energy shoots out of it and hits the mounting for the chandelier in the hallway. And you see the chandelier come down and land on Margaret Payne, pinning her to the ground.
1429.94 1465.94 speaker2  yeah, I shot that thing. It didn't get affected at all by my gun, Fayetteville, D'Artagnan. Fayetteville. I saw Fayetteville burn one to death. So because I can't move because Harvey's got his grip on me, I pull my lighter back out and I try to just set the picture on the wall on fire. Stop setting shit on fire, dude.
1462.94 1474.94 speaker3  you're standing there almost casually with your arm out as this picture frame slowly smoulders.
1472.94 1479.94 speaker4  I was going to lock myself in a room on the second floor and you're about to burn me out, dude.
1477.94 1487.94 speaker2  and I figured you'd just come along with us. So fire kills him.
1486.94 1516.94 speaker3  still under the chandelier. She's looking around in panic and she just makes eye contact with you at the top of the stairs, one bloody hand reaching up towards you. And there's one of these creatures that's swooping down, buzzing down towards her menacingly.
1513.94 1523.94 speaker4  and I jet pack down the hallway.
1521.94 1530.94 speaker3  Are you going for the creature that's about to attack her? What are you doing?
1528.94 1548.94 speaker4  before I can get to her. if you're still with me. I'm following him for sure, but do you hit the creature?
1544.94 1564.94 speaker3  So I think this comes down to your 35% piloting roll. I'll let you use that as a combat skill. This thing is going to attack you in return, and it's going to try to bring you down to the ground so it can rip you apart with its pincers.
1562.94 1569.94 speaker4  Yeah, 33!
1568.94 1614.94 speaker3  Oh, but it's not a crit. Let me just see. I've got a success for it. It is an ordinary one. It just missed a hard success by 1%. So, yeah, you slam into this thing at speed. It doesn't have a face, so it's difficult to describe it as looking surprised, Are you trying to take it outside? Are you slamming it into a wall? Are you slamming it into the ground?
1610.94 1623.94 speaker4  and I am just going to try to jetpack away. I don't know if I can get it to follow me, but I basically want to try to lead it away. You've got a hold of it, I think.
1621.94 1630.94 speaker3  I mean, basically, you've barreled into it. You've got hold of it.
1628.94 1635.94 speaker4  oh, what's something clever to say, boys?
1634.94 1655.94 speaker2  Say that.
1653.94 1668.94 speaker4  And as I'm holding it tight, yeah, I'm going to try to just drop it into a wall with some momentum, bowl it a little bit.
1665.94 1694.94 speaker3  I think it's going to have one chance to attack you, because as you're holding onto it, it becomes very apparent in just how many sharp appendages it has, and it's bringing a couple of these big pincers up to see whether it can remove your face.
1692.94 1703.94 speaker4  like, if I see him going for a swipe, I'm going to try to, like, do a big drop with the jet pack.
1701.94 1745.94 speaker3  and give that a try. 93. and, oof, this could hurt. I mean, it takes a chunk of meat off the end of your nose, and there's blood running down into your mouth.
1744.94 1753.94 speaker4  I say. Good man.
1752.94 1784.94 speaker3  Yeah. Okay, I think it's going to try to hold on to you as you do that. So, yeah, if you want to give me again your pilot roll, and I shall roll again for its, sink its sharp appendages into Lafayette roll.
1783.94 1788.94 speaker2  I rolled a 20.
1787.94 1834.94 speaker3  Yeah. And so, yeah, I mean, you try to throw it away from you, but as you do so, it sinks its sharp claws and the ends of its legs into your flesh. And as you try throwing it away from your body, you can just feel multiple rips in your body as it holds onto you for dear life. Because that's an extreme roll, it does maximum damage on this. So that is... Ow!
1833.94 1840.94 speaker4  Yeah. Yeah, so I'm down to 9.
1836.94 1871.94 speaker3  Okay, so you're still wrestling with this creature in the air. What's everyone else doing while this is going on? because the two of them are pretty much bouncing off the ceiling and the walls all around you, moving at speed. So it's not only like trying to hit a pinata, but it's like trying to hit a pinata that's actively running away from you.
1868.94 1883.94 speaker4  Okay, yeah, you can give me a strength roll to do that.
1880.94 1943.94 speaker3  but she drags herself out from underneath it and says, Oh, thank you so much. I thought I was done for there. Safety, we're safe. Where is safe? Shall we get a car and get out of here? Sorry, the car's not an option. They're destroyed out there. the ones that are armed with these things that look like cameras have been firing them, that there are bits of the wall and ceiling now which are beginning to catch fire.
1941.94 1955.94 speaker4  Perfect. Yeah, we're on their side now, so this seems fine.
1953.94 1976.94 speaker2  Yeah, I'm looking for the religion man. The Reverend.
1970.94 2004.94 speaker3  It's cutting through the chaos and he's shouting in absolute fury, you idiots, you are ruining this. You are ruining everything.
1999.94 2010.94 speaker4  I think I probably just sent her on her way because my wife is still flying around.
2009.94 2039.94 speaker3  Smart. Yeah, I mean the rest of you gather downstairs. There are people running all over the place just trying to get the hell out of here. A couple of them are on fire. There are some on the ground. Immediate laughter from the PTBP crew. Someone was on fire.
2037.94 2049.94 speaker4  It's like, this is great.
2041.94 2052.94 speaker3  What I would like if you're trying to make your way through to the ballroom is dodge rolls off everyone to avoid being stampeded by the panicking people.
2051.94 2080.94 speaker2  Uh oh. I fail. No, I passed.
2072.94 2088.94 speaker3  But, yeah, Mr. Soul gets knocked to the ground and someone's foot slams into your face as they're running off.
2087.94 2095.94 speaker4  Oh, no. It was a little dainty foot. Oh, just a little dainty foot.
2093.94 2248.94 speaker3  It was a child. But the point is, you're down at the ground. The rest of you, through the doors to the ballroom, you can see Reverend Nye is just marching through the panicking crowd. The air is thick with smoke now, and there's more of these creatures buzzing around these electrical arcs flying everywhere. And you see the air around Reverend Nye seems to be shimmering. It's like he has his own personal heat haze around him. His eyes are absolutely black and he just marches up in the direction of one of these flying creatures, shouting, you idiots, you're ruining this, you idiots. And he raises his hand up and there is this shockwave of force. We should have just done that. And as he sees you coming towards him, Jesse's movement coming towards him, he whips around and raises his hand up again. But pauses for a moment as he sees that it's you. It needs to be shown to the world this is such a delicate time, such a precious time. We need to make sure that his invention goes out there and changes the world. This is Cicero's doing. But if you think you understand it, then have at it.
2245.94 2252.94 speaker2  And I want to roll Cthulhu Mythos.
2248.94 2331.94 speaker3  Actually, Cthulhu Mythos doesn't really apply. Oh, shit. Or at least attack the bug. Maybe not Lafayette. Yes!
2329.94 2414.94 speaker4  Hell yeah, that's what I want to do. Right as the breakdown starts. Could I attempt a biology roll against this creature to find any weak spots? It's a science I have. Science biology. Damn.
2408.94 2419.94 speaker3  I mean, you have a choice about what to do here. You've got maybe half a second before they hit you like a wrecking ball.
2418.94 2503.94 speaker4  Okay. Oh. Yeah. What does that leave you with? What's 59 minus 18?
2493.94 2526.94 speaker3  Harvey may be holding on to the undercarriage of this creature, and, yeah, the creature is pretty nonplussed by all of this. And I think it probably wants to get Harvey off it at this stage.
2523.94 2552.94 speaker4  So whatever maneuver I can make to do that. Do you have five luck?
2547.94 2576.94 speaker3  So, yeah, you'd need to have a result of 40 here. Ouch!
2575.94 2598.94 speaker4  Yeah. Go for it. Go for it. Okay, yeah. That's an 81.
2592.94 2619.94 speaker3  But on your first attack there, you did take three damage as it sunk its claws into you. But then you're punching it right back. It's still trying to gut you, so it's fighting back. Nice! That would be a d3 plus your damage bonus.
2618.94 2639.94 speaker4  Yeah. That's a 2, but my damage bonus is a d6. Ah, that's good. That's a 5. So 7. 7.
2638.94 2760.94 speaker3  Oh, hell yeah. Oh. and through the snow sees just the burning remains of the tower out there. And he just stops for a moment, staring at this thing. And you can just feel the stage shaking underneath him. Did you need that? What happened to the tower? And the temperature drops again by a few degrees, and he looks around and says,
2758.94 2768.94 speaker2  Luke, it doesn't anymore.
2766.94 2780.94 speaker4  We smashed it up real good.
2776.94 2804.94 speaker3  and another one of these things spirals and bounces off the ground. This is one that's holding a camera type thing. And as it bounces off the ground, this huge arc of electricity comes off it and shoots over in your direction. Can I have a group luck roll? Whoever's got the lowest luck out of the four of you? I have 4.
2803.94 2823.94 speaker4  34.
2820.94 2848.94 speaker3  There's electricity now. I mean, not just the arc of electricity, but the electricity within the console is sparking your way now as well. Just all this, you can feel your hair standing on end. Yeah, the air itself seems to be electrified. What are you doing?
2847.94 2854.94 speaker2  It is.
2852.94 2855.94 speaker3  energy now.
2854.94 2890.94 speaker2  Oh, OK. I was going to grab it, but I don't think I'm going to grab it. Yeah, my goal is to grab it and then direct it at the machine to give it even more juice. And I'm going to be trying to press buttons that look like they do stuff. This new invention that it was just revealed. Yeah.
2888.94 2912.94 speaker3  OK, fuck. OK, so you're trying to get the machine working. stopped fighting?
2908.94 2920.94 speaker4  and I to a safe stop and we just kind of ditch the corpse, maybe try to drop it on another one of these things. OK.
2917.94 2937.94 speaker3  You are in a target rich environment. fire and sparking with electricity.
2936.94 2967.94 speaker4  Yeah. going away at it using computer use. Yeah.
2963.94 2980.94 speaker3  Before we do that, let's just deal with, was it Mr.
2979.94 3010.94 speaker2  thing. 54 on a 30. So I'm going to spend 24 LUCK. Oh, nice. To succeed.
3006.94 3035.94 speaker3  take your legs off and grab hold of this device. It looks like, yes, it does have controls on it that are supposed to determine when it discharges. But on the other hand, this thing is very definitely damaged. It's just shooting randomly.
3029.94 3050.94 speaker2  making sure that it is facing not at anyone who's working on the machine, but basically like at a wall until I can run over to the machine close enough to direct it into the machine and not at any of my new friends who are over there.
3047.94 3119.94 speaker3  Yeah, I don't see any reason for a roll. So you can just do that for a bit while the others try to get to grips with the malfunctioning machine. Now, just as Lafayette is getting to grips with it and trying to work out how to fix can see how to fix this. So, yeah, I mean, you can see. I mean, if you can just get inside the works and disconnect that red wire over there, then you can at least stop any further damage or at least you can probably limit any further damage while it's on fire. a separate problem. the machine and all of a sudden it's like the room gets turned upside down.
3115.94 3126.94 speaker4  His final trick was perfecting the anti-graviton. Yeah.
3121.94 3146.94 speaker3  I mean, as a mad scientist, yeah, clearly that's what's come to mind. Yeah. Wow.
3141.94 3154.94 speaker2  I wouldn't say that.
3152.94 3192.94 speaker3  ceiling without getting hurt. I mean, you were born to walk on ceilings. awkwardly on the ceiling.
3190.94 3214.94 speaker4  Oh, 36 on a 36.
3211.94 3219.94 speaker2  I could spend 10 luck, but I only have 15.
3216.94 3262.94 speaker3  You land far more heavily on the ceiling. And so this is quite a high ceilinged room. So you are now 20 feet at least away from the burning machine that is right above you. I mean, it's maddening.
3261.94 3267.94 speaker2  Okay, yeah.
3262.94 3279.94 speaker4  So he jet packs up to there or gives it a go anyway.
3274.94 3308.94 speaker3  It's not like you're being attacked at this stage, and it's not like you're fighting strong winds. What is your goal here?
3302.94 3332.94 speaker4  I think I'm trying to disable it, but what can I gleam of this machine's function from messing around in its innards? 96 on a 90. I'll spend six luck.
3327.94 3390.94 speaker3  Something that an idiot like Morden should never have been able to figure out how to do. It doesn't have a power source per se, that it seems to be somehow pulling ambient energy out of just the fabric of reality itself.
3386.94 3438.94 speaker4  Can I tell, so is this thing like spitting out energy right now? But I'll need you up on the aerial, manning it like a turret gun. Because it was above the eaves of the window, right?
3434.94 3450.94 speaker3  So, yeah, you could jump up and pull yourself up to the window. I want to try to do that, yeah. There is this small matter of what happens when you get outside, whether what's happening with gravity is limited to this room or whether you might risk falling off into the sky.
3449.94 3469.94 speaker4  I'm real excited to find out. Okay. So if he does end up falling into the sky.
3465.94 3478.94 speaker3  And then, yeah, if you want to try to grab hold of the aerial.
3477.94 3488.94 speaker4  Ooh! Oh, yeah. Big brain! Give me a luck roll. Okay.
3486.94 3504.94 speaker3  That's a fail, a 68 on a 30.
3500.94 3516.94 speaker4  I want to be able to grab onto the antenna that's on the outside here.
3509.94 3522.94 speaker3  And you can just hear the despairing cries of a few people who've gone out the front door and have fallen up into the sky as well. Holy shit! This is amazing!
3520.94 3531.94 speaker4  So cool!
3528.94 3583.94 speaker3  Are you trying to break it away from the ball? In order to have the freedom of movement to use it like that, you'd probably have to break it away from the ball and move it around or hold it. Then what I want is a combined strength and dex roll, so it's whichever one is lower out of the two that you're rolling against.
3581.94 3603.94 speaker4  And I got an 0-5. Oh yeah! It's an extreme success.
3593.94 3614.94 speaker3  Feeling like you're upside down, even though you're looking up into the sky, there are plenty of these buzzing things around you.
3613.94 3657.94 speaker4  I got it, boss! Here goes nothing! And he flips the switch and turns the thing on.
3652.94 3679.94 speaker2  But he's kind of just like not really sure what to do and just trying to stay safe.
3678.94 3777.94 speaker3  Cool. But you are on the whole blasting away and killing more bugs than anything else. And the bolt hits him almost immediately. His clothes are on fire, his hair is on fire, and he just turns around. His face looks almost inhuman now with the black eyes and the twisted, contorted features. And he almost seems to ignore the burning of his clothes. And he marches across the ceiling towards you, his fists raised, murder in his black eyes. What do you do?
3775.94 3816.94 speaker2  As I'm crying, I just say, And even though I could learn so much from you, sir, it's just hopefully gonna any second now blast off.
3809.94 3823.94 speaker3  the gun fires off again and shoots into him and you can see it just blasts a hole through his chest. And he slumps to the ceiling.
3822.94 3838.94 speaker1  Fuck yeah.
3837.94 3852.94 speaker3  Friend. Master.
3851.94 4007.94 speaker2  Segue. It's always such a pleasure to game with Scott and if you haven't checked it out, he also ran a Call of Cthulhu scenario he wrote called Bleak Prospect for us. You immediately gain access to 30 bonus episodes. We play one-page RPGs, do Q&A sessions, go through session zeros and have a rip-roaringly good time while doing it. And your financial support means so much to me personally. I'm the producer, the editor, the social media person, the business boy, everything. And it's my favorite thing in the world, but I also work a full-time job and have a healthy marriage and I try to keep a decent social life. I sleep sometimes. Your support on Patreon allows me to continue to spend a dumb amount of time working on this show. And I'm down to scale that up if you all are. So, season two is fast approaching. I don't have a date set yet, but while we do take a short break on the main feed to get season two up and running, we're going to do a couple live streams for patrons at every level. Yes, so we will have every single person who is a patron of pretending to be people on Patreon for the live stream, in the chat, everybody going to get hyped for the new season alongside your monthly dose of the Den of Sin over there at patreon.com slash pretending pod. So, if you don't already follow us on social media, now's the time to follow at pretending pod to not miss out on what's all happening, because it's all happening, baby.
3999.94 4033.94 speaker3  So, yeah, you can feel it sparking, bursting into life, and then this almighty arc of power just comes out. It's only partly visible. It's less that you can see a bolt of light coming out of it and more that it seems to be setting the air around it on fire. Holy shit. And, you know, certainly wherever you point it, things seem to be exploding and catching into flames.
4030.94 4043.94 speaker4  just trying to get my feel for the zapiness of it.
4040.94 4101.94 speaker3  and, you know, these things are, you know, small and fast moving. Okay. and, I mean, you're not necessarily shooting every one of these creatures out of the sky, but you've certainly shot enough of them that the others are fucking right off. They do not want anything to do with this.
4100.94 4121.94 speaker4  Good shooting, chap. I turn around and look at you guys. Oh, thanks, guys. Oh, shit.
4117.94 4168.94 speaker3  You probably don't notice the sound behind you at first, This huge claw and another huge claw reaching out as if it's lifting itself up through the ruined remains of a body that is far too small to contain it.
4166.94 4187.94 speaker4  Direct your fire on the beast. Can I have sanity? Pass. No. A hundred. No.
4186.94 4196.94 speaker3  Fuck. So you lose 100 points of sand.
4195.94 4197.94 speaker1  Oh, my God.
4196.94 4213.94 speaker4  Was it a D100?
4212.94 4216.94 speaker3  Is that right?
4215.94 4219.94 speaker2  Sorry, I succeeded. I failed.
4217.94 4234.94 speaker3  So Checkers loses 87 points of sand.
4233.94 4243.94 speaker5  Oh, man.
4239.94 4253.94 speaker3  And Mr. Soul loses 10 points of sand. And yeah, can I have an INTELLIGENCE roll to see whether you go into a bat of madness?
4252.94 4257.94 speaker2  That is a fail.
4256.94 4326.94 speaker3  So that's something. How much has Lafayette lost in total? Yes. So basically, the only one of you who's not in a bat of madness at the moment is Mr. Soul. What's even worse than that is that the person with the death ray hanging outside the window is on zero sand as this huge monster is filling up the room.
4324.94 4354.94 speaker2  I'm down for the summary.
4352.94 4372.94 speaker4  Well, we've faced worse odds.
4369.94 4403.94 speaker3  So let's go round one by one. How do you think this ends for Checkers?
4396.94 4431.94 speaker2  He goes to like just shoot himself to end it, but he doesn't have any bullets left, so he just kind of lays down.
4430.94 4433.94 speaker3  Wait, how much luck do you have?
4432.94 4534.94 speaker4  Oh, shit. And he's still insane. So once he gets back control of it, he's trying to point it at the tentacle thing. But maybe one of those errant blasts hit the machine that was powering it on. Oh, yeah. So I've got no juice to shoot at this thing. I assume a tentacle comes out and just grabs a hold of me and does what tentacle things in Cthulhu do.
4533.94 4545.94 speaker3  It makes it angry.
4544.94 4576.94 speaker2  This is over. And so he crouches down at the side of Checkers. Psychic attack him. And he is thrusting his mind directly into this fucking creature, which the rule book says you can't do.
4574.94 4615.94 speaker3  Just don't get your mind back again afterwards.
4610.94 4694.94 speaker4  He sees all of his three companions for the evening just, like, meet horrible fates. He's probably still floating by the controls when the machine gets, like, shot by Harvey. And at that moment, he just, like, watches in horror as the beast reaches out a tentacle and consumes his man. As he's watching the building just collapse down around him. Or up. Yeah, collapse up around him. He just sees a hole, through some beams, and jetpacks out of there, spending his last luck to, you know, narrowly get by before the Indiana Jones door closes on him. He jets away into the night. Everything that was loose has flown off into the sky.
4693.94 4728.94 speaker5  You know?
4724.94 4734.94 speaker3  Certainly nowhere near as successful as Harvey was. That was fucking amazing.
4733.94 4736.94 speaker5  Wow.
4735.94 4742.94 speaker2  That was great.
4737.94 4768.94 speaker4  Can I ask a question? If we hadn't fucked up the tower, what was the plan? That the beam would hit that tower and then do what?
4755.94 4838.94 speaker3  But he'd found this injured amigo at some stage and started, first of all, extorting it to create stuff for him, and then realized that he could just extract its cranial fluid, inject it into himself, and it would boost his own intelligence. So he started coming up with weird shit like that. So his plan was just simply to create a device to succeed where Tesla didn't, and wirelessly transmit electricity. The tower was basically just a big lighthouse, and the idea was that he'd flick a switch and demonstrate to everyone that there weren't any power sources up in the tower, and yet that light would suddenly beam with an incredibly bright wattage. Yeah. I mean, unbeknownst to him, Nyarlathotep had taken an interest in his work and was encouraging him along, because with World War II and the offing, he decided that what would really help World War II would be if people had death rays. And so he was really keen on getting Cicero's invention out there into the world, just in time to turn the battlefields into killing fields.
4832.94 4860.94 speaker5  You kind of wrecked all that, but you did wipe out most of humanity, so you win some, you lose some.
4859.94 4865.94 speaker3  Gotcha. Incredible.
4864.94 4878.94 speaker4  Scott, you knocked it out of the park again for us. Thank you so much, dude.
4877.94 4904.94 speaker3  Yeah. And yes, I did laugh.
4891.94 4927.94 speaker2  It is an incredible podcast about horror gaming, role-playing, and horror gaming in general, and horror gaming in general. Yeah, that too. Did I get that? It's a solid podcast. It's one of my go-to weeklies. I'm a huge fan, so check that out.
4923.94 4931.94 speaker4  And you can go back if you haven't listened to it already, The Bleak Prospect that you ran for us a year and a half, two years ago.
4928.94 4981.94 speaker2  Yeah, it is extremely good. That's why you're the only person we've brought back. Oh, fuck.
4975.94 5080.94 speaker1  I didn't know that the wind could sew The tissue and faggot bone Hollow and you said I thought you might be starving Briers and dried red clay Crocus blossoms in February And I live in May Time between a mother's fingers And spit off of a bridge While waiting for a fix
5076.94 5086.94 speaker5  Restless legs at 3 p.m. While waiting for a fix Better in my jaw
