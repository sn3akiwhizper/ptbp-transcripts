0.00 139.36 speaker0  Hey y'all, it's Zach. Sorry for not being wolf, he'll be on momentarily, but first I have a quick announcement and a request, a plea, I'm begging, it's a bag. The announcement, you may have noticed we released a trailer for this first season of pretending to be people here on our RSS feed. immensely proud of the result. And the fact that my best friends and I have been able to stay close the bag. Please, please, you've listened to so many hours of this campaign and like three and a half years of our bullshitting banter, so I beg you, please share our trailer for pretending to be people season one everywhere. Reddit, Discord, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, fuck Mark Zuckerberg, everywhere. It would make me feel good. And as Wolf says, the link is in the show notes. Seriously, thank you all so much for listening. We have horribly delightful things in store for you after season one, so hold on to your horses by their sick BDSM gear

I am the segue, and the truth, and the life. No one cometh unto the news but by me. Last time Rose Mary performed its predictable, prepared, profusive prose. Though the production proved powerless due to a pitiful pun, John stood his well-lit ground, shed the skin of his father, and began to alter the stage for what is sure to be a main event level brawl. Don, Keith, and Clark ran for the shiny black building. They were met by a chanting chorus, a singing swarm, a reciting circle, a luminous land liturgy, a crooning crowd that consisted of close to all the characters that have been in this show so far. forever? If so, that's fine. I've got Dragon in 3 with What Kind of World Are You Living In?
422.88 526.00 speaker0  You see little technicolor beams from in front of you as you're running toward this building begin they're confused about what's happening. They're looking around. You see they're feeling their skin like they were just recently covered in ooze. And now they're here. And you see with each And with one arm, this beast swipes at Silas Cole, picks him up off the ground, and as Silas Cole is devoured by this fist, he is no longer visible. you sent him to his seeming demise. It's your turn.
519.76 560.64 speaker2  seeing the town, I was getting nostalgia waves of joy with each person. When you said Gary
552.88 608.00 speaker0  your head, you kind of think back to the moment you were in the circle of knowledge. Chief Maggie Cook places this thing, this little bug-like creature with round circular mouths on the bottom of your left foot, and you're sent to this place where these 12 figures are chanting up to this beast. This beast that now in your memory looks tiny compared to this thing that you're
603.84 632.56 speaker2  I don't know if he can find a way to get into the circle, but he wants to, he's like,
622.56 743.52 speaker0  a light beams straight up into the dark sky from the middle of this circle, and a figure begins rising with both of its hands out from the middle of this inner and outer circle that are going in counter and normally clockwise directions. And you see a light emitting up into the air from this humanoid's face. It is wearing dark robes, and it removes the hood above its head, with black robes about 10 feet off the ground in the middle of this. And you, with your immense power, chanting this same chant has given the overseer an overwhelming dose of unnatural power. this building that once looked huge, but again, with the perspective you have in this world now with this creature behind you, this building doesn't look so tall, maybe three stories, four stories. You hear the phone ring, and it's ringing from the top floor of this building. You
739.92 752.80 speaker2  Does the building have doors even? Like, I don't know. Is it like an unnatural? Yeah,
747.84 838.48 speaker0  that is tugging at the heartstrings emotionally of the other three PCs in this situation, sprint through these people into this building, up the stairs to the top floor. You see a small room. There's a table made out of this inky black substance that the entire building is made out of. There's a candle that is lighting this room that's sitting on top of this table, and the candle is giving off the only light in this room, and it is illuminating two objects sitting beside it on this desk. One on one side of the candle. There is an old-timey radio with strange glass tubes, one of the glass tubes of which is broken, and neither the red nor the green light are lit. On the other side of the candle, there's an old rotary phone.
830.96 862.00 speaker3  deeper, and this red and white light is coming out of it, this angry light, now that you've seen
856.24 1208.88 speaker0  the overseer like the top of a mayday pole as they weave in and out of each other. Now, you've got the inner circle going one way, the outer circle going the other way, and before they in a small circle before carrying on with a new partner. And they head toward this foe. people from all across space and time and this specific campaign move toward this enormous creature, it had just swiped down and grabbed consumed Silas Cole with one of its hands, this group of two intertwining circles chanting has just been consumed by the arm of the Gigantum story. The dice tell the story. And since I can't trust any of you, I'm going to need your cameras, like Thomas is doing now, to show me the dice rolls that you will be making. I'm going to assign each of you a group of NPCs, or former PCs, and you will roll, if you roll under 50, that NPC survives. Justin, show me this roll. We'll roll individually for most NPCs, but for the first three, we're going to put them in a chunk. They're all right next to each other. We've got the Old West folks, not the PCs that you guys played, but we've got the bartender, the piano player, and a gambler named Thomas. Kill them. They all have friend branded across their foreheads, and they have a raccoon, a chunky kitty, and a handsome dog. You better not kill them. the bartender, piano player, and gambler named Thomas, all from our old west of contention
1206.08 1246.00 speaker2  everybody he throws up is about to get swatted right now. It's an eight. Yay.
1239.68 1315.68 speaker0  All right. Next up, Harry clinker with an old distinguished proud. pulls out a slice of white bread with some cut up hot dogs on it and feeds it to the dog.
1314.88 1334.24 speaker2  Good job, Joe.
1325.28 1343.84 speaker0  First is going to be Mildred Mitchell, rainbow earrings, her face completely bruised and swollen from her last encounter with the contention PD and on her shoulder is an old gray squirrel.
1343.12 1360.24 speaker3  22.
1358.16 1368.32 speaker2  He's putting your own dog in it. That's so sad.
1367.76 1373.60 speaker0  There you go.
1373.12 1392.24 speaker3  Whew. All right.
1391.92 1484.50 speaker0  Okay. Yeah. He was a NPC from Contention Critter Coalition, one shot. Just a possum. Fun fact today for you. His eyes have been just as dilated as they ever were on any of his many shrooms trips while he's been in this world. And he's honestly been having a pretty good time. So as he's consumed by this endless darkness within the arm of this gigantic creature, he takes the possum, he takes the possum by the front two legs, stares into its eyes and says, down to the next one.
1484.00 1491.92 speaker3  Yeah.
1490.08 1501.12 speaker0  Bobby Custard is up next. Please don't die.
1500.32 1513.60 speaker3  81. So that's personally...
1512.32 1545.52 speaker0  Oh, I just like this. Perfect. Good timing. Now, can you play him real quick as he dies?
1544.80 1551.84 speaker3  Love it.
1550.08 1562.00 speaker0  Carrie Page's body. Oh, no. Drew Andrews inside with Salem the cat's body.
1560.72 1568.88 speaker3  Agent Trent Chad. I hope God loves me enough for this role.
1568.08 1580.00 speaker0  Have you done your apples today?
1579.12 1615.60 speaker3  Hell, yes. Thank God.
1605.28 1662.08 speaker0  are soaked up into the arm of this massive monster that then grows and grows its arm first. About twice the size it was before as the ooze slowly forms out over the rest of its being. And Rosemary leaps from a top now 15 stories off the ground and lands. Her body does not touch the ground as the four tentacles from the back of her neck slam themselves into the luminous land below. And it kind of holds her up and she makes direct eye contact with the overseer. Keith, it's your turn.
1658.24 1696.88 speaker3  And I get into the same room that he's in with the one candle and I look around and it's just everything is dark except the candle. And I just stare right at the candle and go over to it and blow it out. And then I just lay down on the ground and my heart rate kind of slows down and I just take a ah and lay on the ground.
1695.28 1703.28 speaker0  Clark Bishop, it is your turn.
1699.92 1867.52 speaker2  Yeah, Clark is gonna lay down and steps that somehow everybody already knows this this circular dance he wants he doesn't want to look stupid so he's trying his best to keep going in that dance he stumbles over some people here and there but he's wanting to make his way up to get as close to Clark Gold as he can I don't know what I'm supposed to do now could I do I do you need me to do something uh I feel like we've been doing a lot for sure Thomas is offended keep chanting fucker a lot of your bidding and pretty cryptically too if you could have just told me not to do that I would have not done that that seems kind of it's I'm sorry I'm sorry I don't mean to be mean you're being mean it just got me uh I'll keep chanting if it's gonna help he looks down and angrily chock teela overseer he's lost all his gusto he was really feeling like things were
1858.96 1898.00 speaker0  a few words under his breath you are unnaturally compelled to worship the overseer oh shit
1889.92 2085.04 speaker2  with the phone and I think I he finally stops muttering to himself as he's like shocked into grab the phone and I'm like we got it we got to get back we got to get back that's what you say know what the hell the old timey phone probably should have looked that up the handle it's called assume that's how it worked Satan Satan but I was in my history did do I know like the number I'm we need help down here I start breaking down like a little bit
