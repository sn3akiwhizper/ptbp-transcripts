0.00 82.26 speaker0  What is up my people, it is your friendly neighborhood DJ Wolf the dog. Wolf is here with some hot scoops of news. Now the county said that the body from the junkyard had the organs of someone who died 200 years ago but the skin and hair of someone who died yesterday. Somebody get Ripley's Believe It or Not on the line because that is some unbelievable shit. Charles, a drunk man and friend of the missing John Peters went to the police station to get answers before pulling a gun and running away upon hearing the sound of a car crash in the parking lot. Sounds like it is about to hit the fan and the it is shit my babies. Kathy Piston shot Keith Vigna in the foot. He snooped around her property until trying to stow away on her school bus full of homeless folks. Now John Lee Patymore seems to believe some hooded robot man gave him a message.
78.66 88.90 speaker1  Now we've all had a dream like that before am I right fellas.
83.82 148.62 speaker0  Seems to have been a stolen black SUV t-boning George Piston's truck while it was parked in the police station lot. Now how drunk you gotta be to hit a parked car?
140.58 199.38 speaker2  You come sliding out drift style into the county road that the black SUV is on and you are immediately in pursuit alongside two other police cruisers and the black SUV is taking off and takes a left into the entrance for the water park splashylvania. So you guys pull up to the entrance of the vampire themed water park and see a large wooden sign that reads splashylvania in all caps above a cartooned vampire wearing floral swimming trunks and riding a surfboard. A caption bubble extends from the summertime villain's mouth that says you'll want to splash the entrance. What do you guys want to do?
197.66 204.50 speaker1  Can we tell if it is occupied?
199.38 214.32 speaker2  Doors on the left side on the driver's side are both open and there seems to be no one in the SUV. I want to pull up and check out what's inside of the SUV.
212.92 216.32 speaker1  to suddenly back up.
215.32 232.32 speaker2  Same. Approaching the black SUV when you look inside there doesn't seem to be much in it. It's a pretty clean car. There are no people inside this black SUV. But there's animals and things? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tons of animals. There's squirrels everywhere.
231.32 239.68 speaker1  And a dragon. Objects. There's no people. Roll initiative.
237.20 285.00 speaker2  There's some paper towels. Dragons are spooky. There is the Two Fanged Plunge, Holy Water Falls, and a ride called The Stake, which is a log flume ride but the front of the boat is sharpened and at the bottom of the ride's steep drop there is a massive ornate heart the riders float through. Awesome. That's badass.
284.00 288.00 speaker1  I pass.
287.00 297.36 speaker2  I got an 88. Nice.
296.36 312.16 speaker1  his shoelaces. Oh wait.
310.16 317.16 speaker2  God damn. Why?
315.16 328.16 speaker1  Oh, I have a lot to tell you. Can it wait?
327.16 401.56 speaker2  I'll hop behind. Okay, so the two of you would see across the park, it's a really small water park, but across it you see standing atop the two-fanged plunge is Julie Maxwell in a hospital gown with a terrified Leo piston kneeling in front of her. Leo is kneeling at the top of the water slide where a rider would wait impatiently for a tanned teen to give them the green light and Julie Maxwell cackles into the night sky and and the underground temple from which it shall rise but if there's a tiny chance that justice see a spray of red explode out of Leo piston's stomach and his body slumps forward and begins sliding down the steep yellow slide, a streak of red trailing, his flinching body roll sanity. I failed.
400.56 403.56 speaker1  Is that?
402.56 406.96 speaker2  Yeah, yeah. I passed with a six.
404.56 411.76 speaker1  That means everyone who's your friend gains one.
408.24 418.64 speaker2  Okay, so if you succeed, you lose no sanity. If you failed, you lose one sanity. What do you guys do? Open fire on Julie. I think that's what...
417.64 420.64 speaker1  She just shot a dude. I think she's going down.
419.64 427.64 speaker2  Yeah. Okay. Roll firearms, everybody. 21.
426.64 439.08 speaker1  Oh my God. Holy shit. Yeah.
437.36 447.82 speaker2  Do you want to narrate it or... I mean, it's that.
440.84 469.10 speaker1  As soon as that blood spray hits, I'm already efficiently out, gun drawn with a pistol from this far away. Yeah.
464.52 522.28 speaker2  we desire, but that was tight as fuck. point. see the bodies of both Julie Maxwell and Leo Piston are picked up and slammed into the ground repeatedly and at an absurd rate by some unseen force. And then, as if they were never there at all, their bodies are gone. Roll Sanity.
521.28 547.56 speaker1  I pass. I don't know how though. Yeah, no. up things I've heard in Delta Green. I don't know how to explain being okay with seeing that. Exactly.
545.80 573.68 speaker2  And who failed? Keith Wigner failed. Clark. Just a regular pass.
572.68 591.36 speaker1  No.
583.68 638.96 speaker2  Covering the ground where Julie Maxwell and Leo Piston's bodies just existed, there is Their hands reach out, trying to escape this thing that has trapped them, but their struggle does not last long. Their limbs seem to fold into this ooze, becoming one with the sentient mass of goop that is now sliding across the ground toward you. What do you do?
637.96 713.64 speaker1  Perfect. Okay. I just, I scream at the top of my lungs. And I run off. I hop off. So he takes off running, screaming, hopping, hopping, hopping, screaming. crazy shit. I don't know if I even notice him running off. Is there gore on the sidewalk?
712.64 737.46 speaker2  Yeah. Yeah. Blood and viscera is sitting at the bottom of where like the pool of water that you splash Well, it's not great.
736.46 743.26 speaker1  Yes.
741.70 788.50 speaker2  Your guess is as good as mine, Clark. Yeah. By that old great.
787.50 791.50 speaker1  That makes sense. Of course.
790.50 803.18 speaker2  Yeah. bouncing dot in the distance. He's, he's, he's out of the spot by now. I holler.
802.18 832.02 speaker1  Hey Keith! Hey Keith! The FBI. Yeah. Well, this is a pickle.
831.02 847.30 speaker3  You got it. You got everything here.
842.02 857.02 speaker2  As you guys walk back to your police cruisers, uh, the SUV is still sitting there. And John, as you, um, as you get to your car, uh, you notice that real quick, we shut the
856.02 864.98 speaker1  Yeah.
863.98 872.42 speaker2  It's Ray. Yeah.
869.38 875.66 speaker1  As far as I recall, it's always been Tim.
873.42 876.66 speaker2  The guy who does all the stuff for you, like.
875.66 882.66 speaker1  That's Tim? Yeah. He's Tim now. Well, it's always been Tim. It's always been Tim. Of course it has.
881.66 892.74 speaker2  Yes, it always has been. Cool. Glad we're all on the same page.
890.62 925.12 speaker1  Have you sought medical attention for your foot yet? So my foot, I probably do need to get this looked at. Kathy shot me as I was Kathy piston, George's wife. She shot me in the foot, not realizing it was me.
923.58 936.26 speaker2  She wrapped my foot up for the time being. It's okay, but it hurts real bad and I'll probably bleed through these bandages pretty
933.44 942.74 speaker1  alarm went off and she had, she just left.
938.50 953.20 speaker2  I looked through the small farmhouse that was there that Leo lives in and the barn and
952.20 984.22 speaker1  the pigs are. and I snuck into one of those school buses to see who came out of the warehouse. I assumed it was Kathy. She and about a hundred homeless people got on the bus that I was on, crammed in there and started driving off. I freaked out. I opened up the back door, fell out of it and hopped my way back to the cruiser.
983.22 994.46 speaker2  Yeah.
993.46 1005.48 speaker1  want me around. Also, I told her I had a warrant, which she, she believed. So I don't think we're gonna have to deal with that anytime soon.
1003.42 1007.78 speaker3  Oh, they were, they were homeless.
1006.78 1024.14 speaker1  They weren't. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, it didn't smell like pig shit, but it didn't smell not like big shit. So yeah. The immediate thought of get me the hell off this bus. And then as soon as I fell out of the bus, I thought, well, maybe I should have stayed
1023.06 1031.92 speaker2  I was hiding in the back.
1030.04 1071.84 speaker1  see what I saw in there? That's a, that's a great theory, but I saw black viscous goo with Leo and, and Julie Ice cold. That's why I screamed and hopped off guys. You didn't see that? I got a theory.
1070.76 1085.80 speaker2  I got a theory here.
1080.52 1101.16 speaker1  That shit that happened to them probably happened to happen to her or it, whatever that body was.
1096.22 1111.40 speaker3  When I was getting set up back at the station for an interview, we got a call in from the medical examiner about that body out there in the junkyard. It's real weird.
1107.00 1118.64 speaker1  I opened my car door and just throw up out of the side of it and then continue listening
1112.40 1124.72 speaker3  The sides of it were that of a body that's been dead for a hundred, 200 years, 200 years,
1118.64 1179.92 speaker1  but the skin and hair was deceased as of December 1st yet another perfectly explainable. it all the time. Ancient innards. You get all rotted in there because of your lifestyle choice. I think something is up that we alcohol, which we have never seen before tobacco. So I need to go to the hospital. It sounded something like this.
1175.68 1201.88 speaker2  the underground temple from which it shall rise. But if there's a tiny chance that justice matters, then my sister deserves this fat fuck to bleed out and die.
1197.30 1216.22 speaker1  And according to Vigna, like shiny black goo, slam these people into the ground. So I think you're just drawn at straws here.
1210.26 1218.98 speaker3  There's oil, there's dark soup, there's yeah, yeah, yeah. Dark, dark soup.
1217.22 1222.18 speaker1  You're writing this off too quickly.
1220.46 1233.18 speaker3  He's right.
1227.52 1265.06 speaker2  and your own and you kind of take a look into yours and the camera that you found in Joey Maxwell's car, which is in the back of your police cruiser, obviously that red light is I'd like to inspect the camera. instead of red light. I want to look through it and then I also, I want to feed it a blank Polaroid. Cool. I'd take a picture. That was the steak.
1264.06 1267.06 speaker1  No, no, no.
1266.06 1279.90 speaker3  Okay. One went down one thing. The other went down the other. Yeah. Real fast.
1279.02 1351.18 speaker2  Yeah. You would see the death of Julie Maxwell as well as the death of Leo piston. Great shot. Um, and then you would probably, I feel like the, the shot would be obfuscated. their bodies at the top peak moving around. Cool. So John, you walk back with the camera to the two fangs, you hold the camera up and the viewfinder looks very normal. When you click in to take a picture, there is an extremely bright flash that is almost blinding and as your vision comes back into focus, you see a piece of paper being smoothly printed out of the bottom of this device.
1350.18 1364.30 speaker1  house. Roll sanity. Ooh. Oh, you're going to do me like that.
1363.30 1418.86 speaker2  You're starting to. I believe. You're starting to lose it a little bit. The picture shows a short balding man with large eyes and a tiny nose. He is bent over head and hands and stocks that are a shiny black material and fool is branded into his forehead. You see an inky black substance all over your hands and dripping onto the ground from the camera and the picture. It is pooling on the ground and you could swear it is moving. When you blink, the substance is gone. Your hands are clean and you're holding this odd device and this even otter picture. Let's go ahead and get them back.
1417.86 1431.18 speaker1  Okay. Sorry. Howdy.
1425.82 1435.18 speaker2  And Clark, the two of you see an extremely bright flash of light coming from where John is standing.
1434.18 1439.54 speaker3  He was taking a picture.
1437.16 1456.62 speaker1  It was bigger than a regular flash of a camera. I don't know what kind of camera you're using. Is the gate, is the entrance to, uh, is the entrance to, can I fit my cruiser inside of the water park?
1455.62 1488.14 speaker3  I get out of my car. I'll go and. Yeah. John, what you got? I'm not rightly sure. I look over his shoulder or whatever he's looking at.
1485.06 1498.34 speaker1  I pass him the picture and I look at it with him.
1492.82 1509.58 speaker2  The picture shows a short balding man with large eyes and a tiny nose. He is bent over head and hands and stocks that are a shiny black material and fool is
1508.58 1513.26 speaker3  Like he's hanging?
1512.26 1519.70 speaker1  Like where I took the picture. Like did you just aim it right ahead of you or did you, what do you, the picture's like
1516.54 1541.34 speaker2  super zoomed in seeming you don't really see much around. I'm like reaching out in front of me. You feel nothing. You feel the air. I hit a snow.
1540.34 1543.34 speaker3  I failed.
1542.34 1555.86 speaker2  Keith is fine. And Clark, you lose one sanity. Maybe it's like a printer of some kind, dude. This might not be a camera.
1550.80 1588.54 speaker1  It might be like a printer of some kind from a different, well, this sounds crazy, but like a different dimension. Now you do sound crazy. I'm sorry. It was like viscous black goo.
1584.78 1590.14 speaker3  In the picture of the guy in the stocks, is there signs of the water park behind him?
1588.54 1605.46 speaker2  Uh, no, it's really zoomed in. Oh shit. You really add the whole back is, is blurry and such.
1599.50 1633.22 speaker1  I went to the hospital, a madman jumped out at me, possibly a man, possibly mechanical, but he did. Uh, he gave me a note in binary. John? That's me. That's what happened to cheese dad, but death.
1632.22 1642.86 speaker2  You couldn't see his face.
1641.62 1645.02 speaker3  man also.
1644.02 1653.22 speaker1  Cool. I killed the cheese pops, comma John, not I killed the cheese pops, signed John. It's addressed to John.
1652.22 1683.30 speaker2  Fun thing. It's obviously a little different now and it's got fool branded into its forehead, but you're pretty sure that's John Peters.
1679.34 1688.26 speaker3  I think, I think this picture is John, John Peters, our guy who's missing. God, you're right.
1686.30 1704.60 speaker1  This is the same guy from those pictures in John's house. Is that green light still on the camera or is it red again? It's red.
1703.60 1705.60 speaker3  This is a fool.
1704.60 1710.00 speaker1  Right? Yeah, this thing does not like fools. Oh God, guys.
1709.00 1727.68 speaker3  Somebody don't like fools. Cut in that music. We'll get those rights. We can definitely afford it.
1726.68 1731.76 speaker1  Call out the dude. Call out the dude. I need to get to the hospital.
1730.76 1742.60 speaker3  Oh shit.
1736.68 1756.40 speaker1  Yes, I'll stay behind and try to put together this tangled web of mysteries that are certainly not currently swamping the resources of this small. see if we can't find out what the hooded figure guy came from or what he looks like.
1755.40 1758.40 speaker3  What was the hooded figure thing?
1757.40 1761.40 speaker1  He jumped out of me. Oh, right, right. Are you going to the city?
1760.40 1765.60 speaker2  Which one did you go to?
1764.60 1769.24 speaker1  That's where I would go.
1767.56 1774.24 speaker2  Okay, so that was the end of the day basically.
1772.24 1792.96 speaker1  I'm going to take an overnight here at the hospital. Did I regain any health points? Can you roll to see if he loses the foot? Be hilarious if I did.
1791.52 1804.28 speaker2  Okay, but I have a foot? You do. Can I walk on it well or no? Which do you want? I want a wheelchair. You've got a wheelchair.
1803.28 1819.60 speaker3  That's going to prove problematic.
1817.32 1855.04 speaker1  It's like the one that they had at the clinic. Yeah, yeah, it's super old. Cool. Finally, we can tell the mic what we can't tell the world.
1850.32 1882.88 speaker2  hands and dripping from the odd camera and picture. Your perception changes and you're out of your body, looking at yourself, staring intently at your hands. You see there's the same viscous muck dripping from your eyes and nostrils as you wake up in bed.
1876.52 1891.44 speaker1  things to whichever teenagers are playing Call of Duty at this time of night.
1890.44 1900.44 speaker2  I think he's probably pretty good. Yeah. I think he's put in some hours. Yeah. All right, go ahead and grab Luke. Hey you.
1899.44 1905.44 speaker1  Hey Luke. Hey. Keith.
1904.44 1934.88 speaker2  Hey. Keith, your eyes open and you see a woman standing before you in your bedroom. She's wearing old timey clothing and she stares angrily at you. She lunges toward you, picking you up and throwing you to the ground. You fall into the floor of your bedroom and then you wake up in bed.
1932.00 1949.20 speaker1  But I have seen enough shit that I think it is. There's no one in your room. What time is it? Just do a quick sweep. Nothing? Nothing. I'm going to lay back down but probably have some trouble falling asleep. Probably so.
1948.20 1955.64 speaker2  Yep.
1954.24 1959.08 speaker3  It's a Salisbury steak tonight.
1958.08 2002.88 speaker2  Gross. And you're watching Wheel of Fortune and then you see a man underneath you and you're not on your couch. The man underneath you is struggling to breathe as you tighten your grip around his neck. You look up after the life leaves his eyes and see an empty dark alleyway as you wake up on the couch with infomercials playing on your TV. Okay, so you guys get up and you meet at the police station around the normal time.
2001.88 2006.08 speaker1  Eight o'clock for Clark. You know when crime starts.
2004.28 2012.44 speaker2  Eight o'clock for Clark Bishop. A little bit later for the other two probably.
2008.52 2021.80 speaker1  I think today I get there on time because I didn't really go to sleep last night. Gotcha. I get there late but for the same reason.
2020.32 2037.36 speaker2  Today is December 3rd. Been two days since all this crazy stuff has started.
2034.56 2076.40 speaker1  Yeah, well what, along what lines? After what we saw. What happened? floor. Yeah, it was really scary. Do we really need to hear about your fucked up sexual fantasies? about it. Some weird dream.
2073.24 2098.00 speaker3  Your body's just trying to process what you've gone through.
2094.08 2103.12 speaker1  We kind of forgot to mention her dad might be dead, if you could look into that. The Chief's father? Yeah, Pops.
2102.12 2110.32 speaker2  Great.
2108.24 2120.10 speaker1  John's eyes narrow a little bit though as he looks at Drew.
2117.16 2140.60 speaker2  He's so scared that you might be serious. John knows that and revels in it a little bit. No shit.
2138.40 2161.04 speaker1  Pistons house and their warehouse. That is true. Maybe we should leave him alone. That probably closes that thread. Pistons.
2160.04 2164.60 speaker3  Right, maybe we'll have some cool down.
2162.52 2167.60 speaker2  There's only 5,000 folks in this whole town.
2164.60 2180.20 speaker1  Has anyone notified the Pistons about Leo?
2177.36 2182.48 speaker2  of George's brother without a body.
2180.20 2185.92 speaker1  There is a pool full of his gore. Take him to there.
2184.92 2196.32 speaker2  Yeah, here's what.
2190.20 2210.20 speaker3  That last picture we saw was of John Peters, so maybe we should go back to that case and see what happened to him.
2202.88 2217.12 speaker1  our hands just fucking degrading this town, this town, each other, this town, our values, faces. Should we go back to John Peters' house, or what do you, I don't even know what strings
2216.12 2229.36 speaker3  to pull. John pulls out the keys.
2222.66 2247.44 speaker2  There's a note on your desk, John, that the storage unit that these keys are likely for is called A Plus Storage. They're the only storage units in town that have a G building.
2245.56 2274.80 speaker1  fold up and throw in the back of your cruiser. I took one of the wheelchairs, so I'll throw that in the back of your cruiser and ride with you, Clark. Cool. I'm gonna wheel myself over to outside.
2270.08 2282.48 speaker2  a small house looking kind of thing to the right with a front door. It's a small, probably one-room building. Their open sign is on.
2281.20 2286.04 speaker1  What are the numbers on those? G units.
2285.04 2288.04 speaker2  10 through 12.
2287.04 2296.04 speaker1  Let's go check them out. Let's start with 10. Yeah. What if we all open one, and we open them all at the same time? Yeah, sure.
2295.04 2306.84 speaker3  Why not? Don't they come in different sizes?
2305.84 2321.32 speaker1  I can't open one up right now. I'm gonna sit at my wheelchair and watch you guys open them up. simultaneously.
2320.32 2413.68 speaker2  At the same time. Gotcha. Yeah. We'll get it in post. We'll wait. Okay, let's start with 10. You open up G10. G10 is filled with crates that are stacked three high. There is also a pallet on which is sitting a large cube shaped object covered in so much plastic wrap that its contents are obfuscated. Inside these crates are guns, ammunition, and heavy weaponry. This includes pistols, shotguns, rifles, a shoulder mounted anti-aircraft weapon, an EMP rifle, a grappling gun, a small gun that shoots tracers, lots of grenades, and a few other items. Well, this could be the locker of any honest citizen in contention. You can each come up with anything that you want to be in here in one of these crates and if you roll for luck and I approve it, then it's in one of the crates. Okay, cool. Oh shit. Those are already there. There were shotguns. There doesn't seem to be a sniper rifle. So that could be one. There's an EMP rifle, yeah.
2409.88 2417.36 speaker1  Well, that's actually going to come in handy because I do think we're dealing with some
2414.68 2422.92 speaker2  Do you want to go ahead and roll luck, Thomas, for a sniper rifle?
2421.92 2444.60 speaker1  Something more spectacular. It's just one really sweet vintage cotton candy machine. The mighty cricket? Yeah.
2443.60 2449.84 speaker2  Oh, sorry. Noisy cricket. We all want noisy crickets. Too late. Okay.
2448.84 2452.44 speaker1  Noisy crickets, please. Does it have to exist on earth?
2451.44 2460.40 speaker2  Tiny powerful guns.
2458.52 2462.40 speaker1  No, regular tiny super powerful.
2461.40 2477.44 speaker2  Go ahead and roll luck. 20. You find a very tiny, very powerful gun.
2476.44 2486.08 speaker3  That might be too game-breaking. We've already got radios. We've got radios.
2483.28 2489.20 speaker1  They like read your thoughts and send them to the other players.
2487.08 2505.20 speaker2  These aren't like unnatural items. These are just crazy technological items. Wait.
2504.20 2507.96 speaker1  No. Oh, fuck.
2506.96 2559.16 speaker2  Give your idea to someone else. You can convince one of them to do it. Please roll for it. It's so good. If only. Okay.
2556.08 2572.76 speaker1  Some people, when they play a game like this, might take a moment to think. There might be a lot of downtime. We don't. You will never hear that because it doesn't happen. So are you thinking weapons or like a gadget?
2571.00 2597.00 speaker3  A waffle iron. Wish for a waffle iron. What about just like a really fancy, cool ass, uh, like revolver?
2595.60 2631.28 speaker1  Opposite of what I got. But also... It's a huge, weak gun. I think we should be prepared to shell vast numbers of the enemy. Yeah, right. The fact that this is a rollpoint armed drone. They're probably just misunderstood. Yeah, I don't know. Oh dude, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone.
2630.28 2634.28 speaker3  Should I get a drone? Can I get a drone?
2633.28 2651.96 speaker2  But yeah, you can roll. Pass. All right. All right. Hey. It's a nice one though. It's nice.
2649.96 2660.24 speaker1  I'm going to start cutting into that plastic wrapped cube. Okay. I want to examine it before.
2655.16 2730.52 speaker2  As you're examining it, you examine Keith Vigna cutting into this giant plastic wrapped cube. And as you dig your knife a little bit too far into it, a white powder starts pouring out of it. Let me see that. Step aside. As you begin to take off the outer layers of plastic wrap, you would see that this is bricks upon bricks of cocaine. This is an entire palette. And as you begin counting, based on the math that you guys are, I'm assuming, great at based on your characters, it is precisely 479 bricks of cocaine. Hell yeah. Quick math. Okay. One brick is clearly missing from the pile. I think that we can come back to...
2729.52 2748.16 speaker1  Useful items to have. I don't know. An army of homeless people.
2744.72 2753.68 speaker2  worth roughly $12 million of cocaine.
2752.68 2760.68 speaker1  Because I'm Thomas. I'm not. I think we found a green room. Maybe. So I drop...
2759.68 2764.96 speaker2  Cool. The Gs. They're in the Gs for green.
2762.96 2771.60 speaker1  This is a pretty poppin' box.
2770.60 2772.60 speaker2  And lock it back up.
2771.60 2784.88 speaker1  Lock it back up. I take that. 50 cal. Ammunition for same. I pocket some pistols.
2783.88 2786.92 speaker2  Cool.
2784.88 2789.92 speaker1  And I pocket my regular tiny super powerful gun. Of course you do. I'll name it later.
2788.92 2858.12 speaker2  Perfect. What's its name? Inside G11 is a burlap sack containing $50,000 in shredded blue dye stained banknotes, a piece of notebook paper with poorly drawn diagrams and nearly illegible writing, two 25 pound bags of potatoes, a ziplock bag containing five bulbs of garlic, a garlic crusher, an empty test tube, and a syringe, a small drawstring Nike bag, a three million candle power hand held spotlight, a well filled toolbox, a black leather backpack, a bottle of caffeine pills, a carton of cigarettes, three shovels, a small digital scale, a syringe labeled morphine, a handful of ski masks, walkie talkies, and a burned CD. Could you repeat that? Inside G11. Dope. Yeah.
2857.12 2870.12 speaker1  Okay.
2864.88 2885.64 speaker3  about having all this stuff, but like we're police officers investigating a missing person. I think he would rationalize it that he's seen some fucked up shit last night and he
2881.00 2907.84 speaker1  wants to be prepared for anything and this seems like it's heaven sent. That's right. This is the Lord's word.
2904.00 2910.84 speaker2  tool, flattened Phillips head screwdrivers, and a lockout tool.
2909.84 2916.80 speaker3  I mean, grab everything. There's morphine that could keep us going.
2912.84 2928.12 speaker1  We go out and call Drew and ask him to send a U-Haul down here. Do you want to do that? Logistically, we have the keys. This shit is all here. This could be our base of operations.
2927.12 2933.20 speaker3  Usually as a safe house for ourselves.
2932.20 2939.32 speaker1  Let's get this stuff. Let's U-Haul it out. People might try to take it. Just anybody might come in here and try to take it.
2937.88 2940.32 speaker3  We're confiscating it for evidence.
2939.32 2947.44 speaker1  Yeah, exactly. We can put it in the evidence room, which is probably pretty sound.
2946.44 2949.44 speaker2  We'll put it in there. Let's open.
2948.44 2962.24 speaker1  Yeah.
2954.80 2976.82 speaker2  Inside G12 is a four-wheeler with dried dirt and clay caked all over the thing, as well as a couple of plastic trunks. Near the door is a small chunk of paper that has been folded into the size of a business
2971.56 2981.32 speaker1  card, and against the back wall is a small table with some papers on it. Was there a paper in G11, too? No.
2980.32 3045.08 speaker2  Sorry. There was a piece of notebook paper. Poorly drawn diagrams and nearly illegible writing. Do any of you guys have heavy machinery? No. I want to find someone who would know more about that. of it that fall out. The piece of paper is on a thicker cardstock, and looking at it, you can tell that this is the translator paper on which people place their bets to see what they're betting on. So it's got the odds, and each number from the bedding stubs is in relation to a name on the bedding paper, and it's got a date at the top, and it says October 31st. What are the names? There were three things that you could bet on on October 31st. Hold on.
3044.08 3092.68 speaker1  Did you like that dick I drew? Did you like that dick I drew? That dick you drew? That. Is this like MMA? Do we even? We got no. Oh, Planet Juggernaut is- Something these three things are versing,
3091.68 3102.60 speaker3  I think. Oh, God. So cool.
3095.68 3124.64 speaker2  The ripped up bedding stubs, you can tell he lost, lost, lost, and over the night lost $5,000. Yeah. The first two were probably closer to five to one, six to one, and then the last one was 30 to one.
3122.32 3133.64 speaker1  So he gets like desperate after losing that money? Exactly. Does a Google search for any of those names turn up information on the participants or the sport?
3131.92 3188.12 speaker2  Give me the name of one of those fighters. Yeah. So Oz Mayhem Wolf, it will come up that he has been in like low time MMA fights or amateur cage boxing or cage fighting, whatever that sport's called. Yeah. No joke. disassembled handguns, and an impossibly clean machete sitting atop three full suits, including shirt, tie, and shoes, all covered in dirt, clay, and black stains that look to be blood.
3187.12 3195.24 speaker3  Yes.
3190.72 3226.48 speaker2  As you approach the other plastic trunk, this one has the lid fastened. The stench is nearly unbearable. The trunk is clear and without- I bet there's a hundred homeless people on this truck. Without opening the lid, you can see only a dried black crust, which is painted on every bit of the trunk's insides.
3222.44 3237.00 speaker1  I'm not going to open it in here right now, but let's go see what those papers-
3235.12 3239.20 speaker2  What's that say, John?
3238.20 3254.88 speaker1  Love that movie. K. We took care of nine of them as well as the leader. Okay.
3252.16 3264.84 speaker2  This one is also handwritten in different handwriting.
3261.80 3278.48 speaker3  Life isn't as complex as they believe. They are quite simple. It will be their downfall.
3275.24 3284.44 speaker1  We are here to serve the beautiful community of contention. Is Cole ... Do you remember Cole's Orphanage?
3283.44 3289.24 speaker3  The only thing I can think about-
3284.44 3295.20 speaker1  Didn't we used to go to school with hundreds of smelly orphans? Well, this probably doesn't mean anything.
3292.68 3298.60 speaker3  Let's crumble a month down the way.
3296.52 3300.60 speaker1  Cole was the counterpart to beans, right?
3299.60 3301.60 speaker3  Silas Cole, right?
3300.60 3317.00 speaker1  Oh, yeah. I'm going to ask some old-timers around here and see if they remember that.
3312.60 3327.78 speaker2  He was the owner of the mine for a couple of years. And his wife, Mary Cole, did a lot of good in the community, and the library is named after her.
3326.00 3341.58 speaker1  It's the Mary Cole Library.
3337.84 3348.64 speaker3  But I don't remember a Cole's Orphanage, because I am 37.
3347.64 3357.60 speaker1  it. Cool. Is U-Haul here yet? Yes. Do you want to load literally everything?
3356.60 3358.60 speaker3  Does a four-wheeler run?
3357.60 3400.32 speaker1  Can you drive my cruiser? Are you actually going to ride it out? Okay. I'll drive your cruiser back then. I take my shirt off and I get on the four-wheeler. Is this like the three bears pants situation? The farts are just right. Yeah, catalog it all and then try to do some investigating on the stuff that doesn't make sense to us.
3398.48 3422.12 speaker2  Well, man, there's just so much crime all of a sudden.
3418.56 3427.24 speaker1  I get tired so I do a quick bump and I'm like, ready to go? Oh yeah.
3423.12 3428.76 speaker2  I meant to ask you, are you doing any of that cocaine?
3427.24 3434.48 speaker1  I'm not right now. I'm not doing it right now, but yes. Keith has been known to dabble. Yeah.
3433.48 3449.76 speaker3  Clark is a straightener. Under Clark's eye. I'm adjusting.
3448.76 3457.36 speaker1  He does not. Okay, so can we cut to...
3455.76 3464.28 speaker2  You guys really worked through the day too. You skipped lunch and now it's done at 2 p.m.
3460.68 3473.32 speaker3  In the process of cataloguing stuff, did anything new catch our eyes? Because that's the time when anything would have crossed our vision in particular.
3470.32 3480.60 speaker2  I gave you basically the outline of what each thing is.
3478.20 3482.60 speaker1  anybody that knows about those diagrams that we saw.
3481.60 3486.08 speaker3  Very good. Do we want to do anything with the crusty tub?
3485.08 3498.76 speaker1  Now that we're back... Yeah, we need to check it out. I want to... I mean, maybe it's gore, but it might also be... Somebody might have isolated some of the black stuff. Should we do that in the evidence room or should we go outside or...
3497.76 3510.96 speaker3  I'm kind of nervous about it. Clark is kind of nervous about it.
3509.96 3536.36 speaker1  How about this? Because we ticked our fangs. I'll go into... I assume... Do we have like a jail cell? Yeah. I want to go into one of those with this tub and open it up. I'm interested too.
3531.08 3576.08 speaker2  chopped up human body sits a woman's head split down the middle and pulled apart with a small silver sphere sitting in between the two halves. Well, this could be anything. Hell yeah. Real sanity? You all wear old hands. I crit pass if that helps me in any way. Oh, yeah, it does. How about you don't look? Okay. For sure. Keith and John, you both lose one sanity on a pass. Are you going to put the lid back on? Oh, yeah, I am. Okay. Identifiable. Yeah.
3575.08 3579.20 speaker3  Yes.
3578.20 3602.16 speaker2  If you will. Clove in twove. It's cloved in twoved.
3599.52 3609.80 speaker1  But it's identifiable to someone that would have known this person.
3607.08 3619.20 speaker2  But like, it's not really, it's so old. This has been. Well, that's, how about this?
3617.36 3629.40 speaker1  box to the corner. Let's grab it.
3628.40 3643.88 speaker2  You grab it. Look, it's a little silver sphere. About the size of a large marble. And by large marble, I mean it's one inch in diameter. So the radius is a half inch.
3642.32 3660.52 speaker1  I hold onto it for good luck. Awesome. Oh shit. I don't know that good a man. It didn't like attack and kill us, so I assume. Why would you assume a dead body would do that? I've seen some fucked up shit today and yesterday. How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the
