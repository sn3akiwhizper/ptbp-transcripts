0.00 214.24 speaker0  Yesterday, I ate a whole bucket of long-deceased crab. Now y'all know I like to dive right into a slop bucket, putrid or otherwise, but something about these weird ocean spiders got me feeling nasty. But not Wolf the dog nasty, just regular diarrhea nasty. What does not make me feel nasty is broadcasting live from 694.2 PTBP, the only radio station that is also in the past and the present and the future at all times, but also sometimes none of them. This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Daisy. If you want to write up something for y'all wolfy to howl, tag the show at Pretending Pod on Instagram or Twitter, or write up a 5-star review on Apple Podcasts and email us at PretendingPod at Gmail dot com. That way you can be like Daisy here. They write, Hello to everyone in contention and beyond. Thanks to the weird time stuff going on in contention, Texas has gotten a signal to y'all's best and only radio station, 694.2 PTBP. I've been listening for a month or has it only been a few days? Contention is so weird with its time. Well, I would just like to take this time to say thank you to Wolf the dog, his producer and all the people who make this radio segment possible. Sincerely, Daisy, sending all the love and trash in Texas. We are going to write a Delta Green scenario as a community. Over the next few months, we'll be having prompted writing contests to find the best to make ourselves a narrative feast. to be people. The deadline for submissions here in round one is August 22nd. Show us what you've got and vote for your favorites to help us choose the winners. The one where the boys played Lover in the Ice, the infamously mad fucked up Delta Green scenario written by Caleb Stokes? Well, that was just part one of a three part series. You can find parts two and three over at patreon.com slash pretending pod. There's a link in the show notes. Green, and Kala Cthulhu's original scenario, The Haunting. You can also listen to the session zero for season one, during which the boys create the town of contention and discuss character ideas.
208.20 229.70 speaker1  And uh, next up on the Patreon docket, some fucking human named Justin is running roll
224.62 355.60 speaker0  Speaking of notes, mine here in front of me are all dusty, but I'm pretty sure they say Hollering, he ran off the missing Miss Kitty, who was digging with her hands over the burial site while mumbling to herself. He couldn't help but overhear the slurring about the missing gambler being last seen in the mine which he referred to as living oil. in the night, leaving the building without electricity to the judge's bewilderment. Tartally, he loped to the church for the town hall meeting about the recent disappearances.
350.88 457.68 speaker1  week until you're weak from these sweet, sweet elite beats. It's the Creek Rocks with Can't You Hear Them Wolves Howlin' Can't you hear them wolves howlin' All around my poor little darlin' All around my poor little darlin' I'm afraid they'll get my darlin' Can't you hear them wolves howlin' All around my poor little darlin' All around my poor little darlin' I'm afraid they'll get my darlin' Can't you hear them wolves howlin' All around my poor little darlin' All around my poor little darlin' I'm afraid they'll get my darlin' Justin, what do you think you would do for money if you existed before 1900? Oh yeah, I'm strong so I'd beat people into submission. You could do like bare knuckle boxing.
456.64 464.48 speaker0  Yeah, we'd box.
461.36 475.04 speaker1  I would be the boss because I can't do manual labor. Is that how that works immediately? No, I'd be a grifter for sure.
470.96 494.48 speaker2  Just like flouting from town to town, changing your name. Quick, what's your name? John.
494.00 508.32 speaker1  Too late? Never mind, go on, go on. Terrible, man. Would you be a barber? Oh, could you be a barber? No, I don't know how to cut hair.
506.32 509.76 speaker2  I don't know how to be a foreman, but I'm going to.
508.32 511.84 speaker1  It's the 1900s, dog. There's no rules.
510.48 542.88 speaker2  It's the 1800s. The 1800s. I was going to say, I mean, like a bartender or like a... Well, the three of us would literally be giants. Because we're tall? They weren't, they were short back then? Yeah. Hobbits. I'm almost positive. I want to play baseball in the late 1800s. I'll teach them how to play if it's... Oh, nice. Was it 1870 something?
540.56 552.88 speaker1  We're going to teach them how to play baseball.
552.00 555.68 speaker2  Or do you play third? Third. Joe. I'm a Joe stop.
555.36 567.76 speaker1  Home Joe.
567.04 574.96 speaker2  And like... Oh, like everything.
573.04 585.20 speaker1  I was looking up recliners.
582.16 607.44 speaker2  I would just do all sorts of music. I would, for some reason, the first song on my mind is Higher by Creed. I think they would love that. like Little Lion Man. By Stomp?
606.00 611.04 speaker1  Trash can fellas?
610.48 616.00 speaker2  Yeah. Stomp, stomping music.
614.24 620.48 speaker1  Stomping music? Yeah.
618.48 626.32 speaker2  They didn't have a drummer, Thomas. The lead singer just had a kick drum and that's it. Is that a true story?
624.88 630.88 speaker1  Is that part of their origin story?
627.68 632.08 speaker2  The Ho Hey song with stomping and clapping.
630.88 638.00 speaker1  The Ho Hey?
634.48 655.68 speaker2  You know, like, Hey, they do that a lot throughout the song. Isn't that Mumford and Sons? I don't think it is. The Lumineers. Hell yeah, dude.
654.56 659.28 speaker1  iPod touch?
658.80 664.40 speaker2  I don't know.
663.84 665.36 speaker1  Like pornographies?
664.40 670.08 speaker2  I didn't have any videos.
666.24 673.36 speaker1  Did you put any dirty films on your big iPod?
671.28 678.80 speaker2  I had explicit music on there. When were you guys allowed to listen to explicit music?
676.32 679.60 speaker1  I was never like not allowed to.
678.80 744.40 speaker2  Did you have to hide it? By the time that was a problem, I was just downloading everything I wanted. LimeWire and then that's when I got all my stuff. and they cuss up a storm in the skits. I do remember my mom saying something like, I wish we would have just gotten the soundtrack to Dead Man Walking, I had a three CD disc changer. I specifically remember at one point in time, it had Mercy Me, and it had The Bends by Radiohead.
743.76 746.88 speaker1  Interesting.
744.40 785.20 speaker2  That's a mix, eclectic. What year do you think that would have been? 2004? 2004? Mine would have been just classic rock. In 2004, for sure, mine would have been, I think I was still, that would have been the tail end of my Zeppelin phase. My dad's a big John Denver fan, so I didn't get into classic rock until School of Rock came out.
783.36 808.48 speaker1  that I no longer listen to, because it's not always the most fun thing to listen to. Like Eminem? Like late Jay-Z. Oh, Joe. I didn't mean it that way.
807.44 823.28 speaker2  I didn't mean it that way. I was trying to think of another big rapper. He is alive. I don't know if you know that. Joe couldn't have meant it that way, because he has sheltered Tupac for a few months in his loft.
821.52 842.00 speaker1  He's like, I know Tupac's fucked. and Joe started hammering up barricades over. What's he saying?
840.72 846.80 speaker2  Does he have an E.T. in there?
846.08 850.64 speaker1  Is that E.T.?
849.76 857.68 speaker3  It's definitely not. It's an E.T.! It's an E.T.! It's not anything else.
857.04 864.00 speaker1  Oh my God. It's Biggie!
863.12 870.40 speaker3  It's 3Pac!
869.44 876.56 speaker1  Just those last two.
874.08 921.52 speaker2  Really ramped ourselves up for the Old West mood here. So this will be the day after Everett's interesting evening, after Horace Green's attempt at sleep, and after Jack Perlman's night of fun. So, Judge Ephraim, Courtland's day that we dove into. Who's gonna be at the town hall meeting on time? Not me.
919.44 931.84 speaker1  Yeah, Horace goes. Okay. Rough night. Sorry, I'm still thinking about how Joe harbored Tupac from,
930.24 943.68 speaker2  you know, the Illuminati or whatever. There it is. Luke and Justin, take your headphones off.
942.16 949.20 speaker1  Oh my god, are you drinking a Coke?
948.00 952.56 speaker2  Nice, no calories.
951.20 986.96 speaker1  It's only for men.
985.60 1016.88 speaker2  And the smell in here? Foul. Thankfully, this is a lunch meeting, so the sun isn't shining directly through the windows, but the shade just lends itself to the wetness of the air. Bobby Custard takes his place at the pulpit and begins speaking before the unruly crowd simmers down.
1014.40 1028.56 speaker3  disappearances of all them saloon folk.
1028.08 1037.28 speaker1  end of that.
1035.20 1106.88 speaker3  Oh, Mr. Pace, yes, of course. Round last night, I reckon the moon was high up there. It must have been two in the morning or something. There was a ruckus out there by the tree line. There's something that means a lot to me out there. It's where I buried my wife. I walked up on and it was Miss Kitty. And then she looked at me and then she just took off running in the woods. I hollered after, but you know, I can't keep up with anybody these days. And I don't know what happened after that. Y'all have a good day. And he starts walking out. If you clearly have some sort of information.
1098.72 1144.08 speaker2  as the night watch at the cemetery stands up, hat in hand.
1139.92 1197.92 speaker3  I, I promise I Bible swear. I swear. I don't know. I, I, I'm telling truth. She had three corpses on her back and she ran off with them heading down south. Is that what you're trying to? and must have headed down to your property there, sir. I'm deeply sorry. Thank goodness. She didn't, she didn't get down in that hole deep enough. I was able to put some earth wrap back on there. She didn't get deep enough. You must, you got her. I would have never expected Miss Kitty. Was she on hard times or something?
1194.24 1215.52 speaker2  She, she always had the money to live her life. at him with huge eyes and he's like, I mean, I, she, I don't know.
1212.64 1252.48 speaker3  Oh my goodness. I did not expect this much information to come out so soon. Like much appreciated from the both of you speaking up like this.
1247.20 1273.36 speaker2  features toward the church house at the exact same time. And Jack Pearlman and Judge Ephraim Courtland arrive almost simultaneously.
1272.64 1280.40 speaker1  We'll say yeah. You tie, tie up my horse. You got to tie up that horse.
1276.00 1285.04 speaker2  Otherwise any old random groundhogs can come up and they're scaring off around there and take off without a horse driving around.
1282.56 1314.08 speaker1  Exactly the words I would have also used. Same. I give Jeremiah a good little pet and head on in following the nasty man. Spits on the ground.
1310.72 1366.80 speaker2  of disgusting flesh falling from itself. Presence of Judge Ephraim Courtland spit on the ground as he walks in to the church with Jack Pearlman, a much different hotter figure, following right behind. in a church, it's not a service, whatever. They all become green with the sight of Judge Courtland and then immediately blood rushes to certain spots and especially cheeks when Jack Pearlman walks into the church.
1365.12 1378.08 speaker3  Oh, hello there Judge. Um, I was just asking to see if there's anyone who had any sort of information to bring forward about the disappearances recently of the saloon.
1376.32 1396.08 speaker2  My copper wire got stolen. That's why I'm here. And the judge is just standing in the aisle and everyone's just kind of looking at him.
1389.60 1398.80 speaker3  Is that, I'm sure, do you want me as like Sheriff, you want me to take care of that?
1397.28 1426.08 speaker2  I can't turn my lights on. Okay. That my secretary told me to come here because of my wires. Thought that was what this meeting was about. There's like the pew. He just like scoots someone over and sits like right next to the aisle.
1425.04 1450.56 speaker1  Rhubarb, rhubarb. Jack Pearlman, I'm assuming was kind of like with him upon entering, but whenever he started mouthing off and yelling, he kind of just like scooted sideways kind of a way to the, the back of the, the church to kind of listen and not be associated with him at all. Yeah, makes sense.
1448.88 1453.60 speaker2  Horace Green is just reading a book.
1453.28 1473.84 speaker3  Sure. As, as soon as we're done here, first thing that I look into for sure, but we're talking Satan's last night of Ms. Kitty out and about.
1471.60 1477.92 speaker2  Kitty was grave Robin.
1477.04 1486.80 speaker3  Uh, yes.
1484.64 1490.72 speaker1  What'd you ever, what'd you dig up? What'd you see her dig up?
1488.00 1498.56 speaker2  It was three old, old bodies. Who'd you dig up? Yeah.
1495.84 1506.40 speaker3  Who, who'd you get from the cemetery over there?
1498.56 1582.24 speaker2  It was, uh, Sally Jensen who, as we all know, pass God 30 years ago now. Mitzi Frankenship, who unfortunately left us 34 years ago. I can't pronounce it. It's a lot of consonants all in a row. It's S T E I N F P F I E M P Z F. I don't know how to say that, but she died 37 years ago. She, she taught me in school. I remember I had to spell her name. It had every letter of the alphabet. So some of his kitty disappeared him or what?
1576.64 1598.16 speaker3  So Ms. Kitty did come around and, uh, and it was taken by, she took three before she headed off three from the cemetery for she headed off up to the pace place. She must've dropped off them bodies somewhere along the way. Cause she didn't have them.
1597.84 1601.92 speaker2  Okay. Let's go get her. Go get her. What?
1600.56 1604.40 speaker3  You know where she is?
1603.28 1630.16 speaker2  What are we even here for? But what do you mean by let's?
1627.36 1633.28 speaker1  Speaking, I'm speaking as a biologist, sir.
1632.00 1641.44 speaker2  You know, I can ride around. My mistake. Shut the fuck up.
1640.64 1660.00 speaker1  Let's go get her.
1659.20 1670.64 speaker2  Well, you guilty. Oh, holy shit.
1668.96 1691.04 speaker1  Oh my God. It's going to kill everyone. He's got mad monster.
1690.24 1698.08 speaker3  Fuck.
1696.88 1725.52 speaker2  And the whole crowd goes. Okay. Completely. Okay. No one bats an eye. Everyone's down for it. They enjoy the smell.
1724.64 1728.64 speaker1  anything else.
1727.92 1735.52 speaker3  What's going on? Does anyone know?
1732.32 1743.20 speaker2  Does anyone know where she is? Everett? Where did you last see her?
1742.08 1755.04 speaker3  I mean, south. I think it was about two in the morning. I just made that up, Zach. I don't know if that matters the time.
1752.96 1756.96 speaker1  No, it was three in the morning. It was late at night.
1755.84 1771.28 speaker3  I didn't have my watch on me.
1769.60 1990.24 speaker2  62 on a 65. Joe and Justin, take your headphones off. Around this time, you notice a man standing in one of the windows watching the proceedings take place. You recognize him immediately as Silas Cole. This man has made contention what it is today. He is the reason that the mine is profitable. He is the reason that there's electricity all throughout the entire town. He is the philanthropist making sure that children have education. Him and his wife, Mary. He's five foot eight. He's got messy, dirty blonde hair. His crooked yellow teeth and bright green eyes that are sunken in, but they're also of the church. I believe there are some breakdowns in athletics in this game. And so... Oh, nope. There are not. I was completely wrong. How would you run fast in this game? Fast talk, but with your legs. Pilot your own self. Jump. It's like a video game where if you jump, fast. All right, we'll just use dexterity. So roll a dexterity contest against each other. Fail. 73 on a 60. Okay, so you're both going to make it out at the same time? Stumbling over each other. Yeah. With Courtland leaving, there's a breath of fresh air inside as you both kind of bail outside. Just these massive eyes. He's holding a ladder. And right next to him, he has odd looking mechanical devices with some sort of like wooden planks going off from a middle point on his body. No, no, no. On the ground next to him, he's got like three or four of these devices, essentially, that have some sort of motor in the middle and then these planks coming off from them and around his shoulder like a lasso. He's got copper wiring. Oh, well, Ephraim, we might have solved your problem. He's wearing huge pants. So he's wearing both suspenders and a belt. Well, a chill runs down Thomas's spine. No, no, no. This is Silas Cole.
1989.04 2040.48 speaker1  I know, but clearly. me any fossils they might find in the mine. I'm concerned about... Why are you concerned? Have you heard anything about Thomas? Did anything happen to him in the mine?
2036.80 2056.64 speaker2  His eyes are bugged out, looking at the ground, kind of looking at your feet. And then he looks straight up at you, and he's like, I don't know what you're talking about.
2054.16 2061.84 speaker1  Could you explain the principle to me?
2058.00 2073.84 speaker2  I'll show you if we go inside, but did you... This Thomas fellow, what do you know about him?
2068.24 2077.36 speaker1  Uh, I'm worried someone might have hurt him for his gambling debts. Do you think that's why he's gone?
2076.16 2089.68 speaker2  It could be, Mr. Cole. Indeed.
2087.76 2115.76 speaker1  the day before his disappearance.
2110.64 2206.80 speaker2  Okay, so first off, I need psychology. A 90 on a 10. We had words, I'm glad he's working for you, because he's not working for me now, obviously, because he's gone. And then Judge Ephraim grabs the copper wiring or goes to, and Silas Cole puts his opposite arm on the Judge's shoulder and looks straight up into his eyes. And you see these wild green bulging eyes looking at you. Are you sure that you want to do that unless you're helping me? Because it seemed like maybe you're not helping. I would do no such thing. If your lights aren't working there in the courthouse, then I can get that working for you. But these are for the church currently. So please either help me carry them inside or release them.
2203.52 2217.52 speaker1  Horace Green, um, chews on his pipe a little bit and blows some smoke into the air and turns around and goes back into the church.
2214.00 2244.48 speaker2  the entire time either one of those actions are taken.
2238.48 2263.20 speaker1  spits some chew spit on the ground and he's got copper wire over his shoulder and he just throws a copper wire onto the ground and just kind of stands there. Horace goes back to where he was sitting and opens up his book again, but it doesn't really look like he's reading it now.
2258.32 2335.44 speaker2  And as soon as Courtland, Judge Courtland says Cole's here, the doors bust open to the church and a skittish man looking at the ground in front of him kind of seeing the copper wiring on the ground immediately starts collecting it as he's pulling in these four odd contraptions you've never seen before. Some sort of motor in the middle and then wooden planks coming off from the sides. Silas Cole is five foot eight with messy dirty blonde hair. He's got crooked yellow teeth and these bright green eyes that are sunken in but also bulging at the same time. And he's wearing huge pants. He's got suspenders and a belt. Yeah. Carry on. I'm just gonna go ahead and hook these up for y'all. It's pretty hot in here. And this is the new one and kind of like holds a thumbs up. Do we do this yet?
2333.92 2340.48 speaker1  You really do need to watch Dark.
2339.52 2364.08 speaker3  You found your wire.
2355.36 2385.84 speaker2  and is hooking up the very first ceiling fan that's ever existed here in the town of Contingent. And he looks down at you and he's like, Maybe you know something about it.
2381.44 2397.60 speaker1  and puts a hand on it and kind of like menacingly looks up at Silas.
2388.40 2500.48 speaker2  I'm just here to provide circulating air for the entire townsfolk here while I have contention. Air's not good enough here. Being right above you, the smell is not pleasant. comes back down the ladder. Are you like right at the base? And then yeah he just looks you dead in the eyes with these wild crazed green eyes and begins moving the ladder forward. He runs the wire through real quick and sets it up and the first fan starts going. And everyone in this room feels relief from this hot humid air for the first time. And as he begins setting up the second one he looks down. Personally, good riddance. Contention's better off without those people. to figure out what the next best move is. Bobby Custard takes control once again and is like, Silas Cole looks at you.
2499.04 2514.56 speaker3  We get to it then.
2513.36 2526.24 speaker1  Completely ignores you.
2519.44 2531.20 speaker2  until their voices rise up meeting yours and your voice is lost as you say Mr. Cole.
2529.68 2582.16 speaker1  Is it Custer or Custer? Yep Bobby Custard. As I say that I'm gripping him ever so slightly more aggressively. Roll intimidate. Uh do not pass.
2579.60 2594.48 speaker3  robber on the loose we're gonna have to stop that. They'll just keep coming night after night taking all the bodies.
2587.84 2615.76 speaker1  Sheriff I overheard a minor last night um saying that one of the disappeared had been arguing with Mr. Cole. Now I seem to think he's he's got an ulterior mold of fear. Don't just let these people disappear because he gave you some fans.
2610.08 2628.40 speaker2  Now I I it's not that I'm not doing anything because there's fans here it's just that
2621.36 2654.24 speaker3  of you and if if we don't know where this person who clearly disappeared and then somehow came back. If we don't know where to go after her then I don't know what you expect me to do. Well it sounds to me like she's got something in the woods there. She had three bodies. She didn't have three bodies when I saw her. She dropped them off somewhere between here and there. We got to search around between here and there.
2651.36 2685.20 speaker1  Sheriff what are you planning on doing about about that? Because you know you got to do your job so I can do mine.
2680.88 2718.40 speaker3  owns and runs this town if you guys catch my drift. But if you happen to have plans aka Mr. Pace going down to the woods trying to find a spot in between the two spots I'll certainly come with you if if you if you if you require my assistance but if we could keep it on the down low from Mr. Cole clearly I think that would be the best course of action. So maybe don't all stand around here all at the same time.
2714.32 2737.28 speaker1  Jack turns around and just starts walking out puts his hat back on his head or whatever. a little bit then the professor turns around too and he's like he looks like he did not get what he wanted from the from the sheriff.
2735.92 2746.32 speaker3  situation.
2743.04 2780.32 speaker1  him off till I get one of them fans so uh yeah. walk off.
2776.64 2785.92 speaker3  we do it's you that I'm blaming.
2784.88 2794.56 speaker1  What a creepo.
2793.92 2814.40 speaker2  Big fan. Horrified of what you're capable of.
2809.52 2821.44 speaker3  He's he's worried about his the grave on his property there and uh you know doesn't really know what's going on.
2819.20 2922.24 speaker1  it's just that this ended up on his doorstep. Horace typically wouldn't care to get involved either but he can't resist a conundrum. a criminal so he gets excited at the thought of catching one. Horrifying. Jack Pearlman probably was uh less invested before he got pissed off by Judge and Silas Cole kind of just being assholes. Which is funny because at first he was pissed off at the Judge for being an a jerk to Silas Cole and that he was way more pissed off at Silas Cole implying that they should do nothing. And it kind of lit a little fire underneath him as a citizen of contention. Under his little butt. Under his little hot buns. Under his tight little butt. punching somebody. And uh I think Jack Pearlman and Everett Pace are gonna get fanfic'd together. I can predict it already. Ship him. Ship him. Oh. Jevret.
2921.68 2928.32 speaker3  There it is.
2927.76 2970.48 speaker2  Nice. you see Silas Cole walking down south to the new mine where they've set up shop after the one a little bit west of there has finished up.
