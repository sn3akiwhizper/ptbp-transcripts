0.00 31.00 speaker0  Welcome one and all to Contentions most exciting local news radio show, ran by yours truly, Wolf the Dog. Now let's jump right into some news. Now I heard the officers went to Chief Maggie Cook's house, and boy wouldn't you know it, she wasn't there. And then they went on over to everybody's favorite bar, Klinker's.
25.56 48.80 speaker1  as hot dogs on white bread, ya boy Wolf's favorite meal. Julie Maxwell had a restraining order put out against Leo Piston back 15 years ago for killing her sister Ashley. Now that is some messed up shit.
43.72 62.52 speaker0  And wouldn't you know it that some idiot at City Hospital fucked up and put Julie Maxwell in the morgue. She woke up from a coma and started bloody screaming.
59.52 93.88 speaker1  and best variety of music in Contention.
87.96 112.52 speaker0  Drew looks nervous as he hands you the note, and the note says that body had been dead for years.
107.70 124.28 speaker2  They've never seen anything like this down at County, so go ahead and roll sand for me. Wowza. 10. Oh nice. 60. I mean I assume you have far more than 10 sanity.
123.28 129.56 speaker0  Yeah.
128.56 140.28 speaker2  what they're doing. They messed something up. They messed something up clearly. You got some time to kill before the Piston Brothers come out.
134.32 142.28 speaker0  Clark definitely wants to look at the file on the Ashley case when she was hit by the car.
141.28 245.86 speaker2  Oh the Ashley Maxwell. Yeah. Okay, so diving into the old file on the death of Ashley Maxwell, you'd find out that she was on her way to Splashylvania, the town's weird vampire themed water park to meet up with some friends. Clark would remember that Splashylvania used to bring in snow machines in the winter months and let the townspeople sled down the water slides that use sleds and go down. This was very obviously a fucking awesome but terrible idea. And after more than a few broken bones, the water park has only been open in the summer months for the past decade or so. ago. So her sister Julie went looking for her. Julie found Ashley's body face down in a watery ditch on the side of the road. She also saw the beat up truck that her former classmate Leo Piston drove around town. It was heading toward the Piston pig farm. The autopsy showed that Ashley had a severe concussion but actually died from drowning. Leo Piston eventually broke down in a testimony and admitted that he had gotten out of his truck to ask Ashley a question and he must have scared her because she sprayed him with pepper spray and in his flailing about he accidentally hit her in the head and he immediately drove home to get water on his eyes. The Maxwell family, Ashley's family, was fervent in their disbelief of this story but the judge was easy and gave him one year of juvenile detention.
242.48 251.66 speaker0  So that's basically what you would learn from that file.
247.44 269.30 speaker2  Right after school, basically on December 1st, so her and her friends and her sister and her friends, they were all meeting up to go do the like sledding at Splashylvania. But she never made it.
268.30 279.30 speaker0  I dig it. For sure. Yeah.
278.30 312.34 speaker2  For sure. This is the first block when an awkwardly tall, skinny man with gin blossoms and bad teeth walks into the police station and he is visibly distraught. This is not George Piston. He walks right past Drew and stumbles a bit into your desk. You can smell the alcohol in his breath as he mumbles, my friend is gone and you haven't done anything about it. Where is this missing person's whatever? Why aren't you looking for him right now?
310.06 334.50 speaker0  Hey, what are you doing? What's going on here? Just he just seems wobbly. Yeah. Hey, uh, but what's, what's going on? You're you're, you're talking gibberish. Yeah, you're fine.
333.50 335.50 speaker2  your papers.
334.50 343.98 speaker0  Hey, whoa, sir. Hey, I need you to sit down. You got to do your fucking job, man. All right. I'll listen to you, but you got to sit down first.
342.98 373.02 speaker2  All right. All right. I just, my friend John Peters is gone and I went by his house earlier and the lock was busted and there was a mess inside and he hasn't been online in like a couple of days and that's not like John. And so I need to, I need to know why you're just sitting here when he's fucking gone.
370.42 387.44 speaker0  We, we, uh, we've actually been alerted to that case. We've, we've been working on it. Uh, when was the last time you saw him?
379.22 419.60 speaker2  We just like, you know, he's just an old friend from the days and we used to know each other. So I, I just, I, he like starts crying and then he like stands up and just walks to the back of the police station basically. And he just is like looking around at different stuff.
417.64 449.16 speaker0  Hey Charles, come, come on back here. Why do you think somebody took him?
445.36 462.96 speaker2  like I know John and he wouldn't do that.
461.96 464.96 speaker0  We came to that conclusion as well. Do you have this stuff?
463.96 481.48 speaker2  What did you find? We didn't find a whole lot there. Do you have his, do you have his keys?
480.48 518.56 speaker0  Yeah. But we, we, we've got his keys. sure. Okay. Cool. I pull them out of my desk and I'm holding them way far away from him and literally showing him. Okay.
511.36 524.12 speaker2  just reek of booze and he is staring very intently.
522.80 525.12 speaker0  Oh no, you can, you can see him.
524.12 530.32 speaker2  You can't touch him. Can I see him with my, with my hand?
528.80 534.12 speaker0  Uh, have you had something to drink tonight? Yeah.
532.52 582.24 speaker2  I got a car. Did you drive here? Nah. Charles, the guy standing in front of you immediately pulls a gun and runs outside.
581.24 597.64 speaker0  Holy shit. Stop.
593.80 633.00 speaker2  truck has been T-boned on its driver's side. A large black SUV is reversing onto the street and begins to drive east. Roll alertness. plate as it begins to drive away. Charles runs to a car that is parked in the parking lot and gets behind the wheel. What do you do?
632.00 637.00 speaker0  No stop. Gun is probably drawn. Yeah.
636.00 642.08 speaker3  Okay. Stop. I'm probably getting around to his driver's side if he's already getting in the car.
641.08 645.80 speaker0  He's getting in.
644.80 654.08 speaker2  So real fast.
653.08 657.08 speaker0  Any sign of George? Yeah.
656.08 668.96 speaker2  He's been smashed. You can kind of see him. He's behind the wheel of his own truck.
666.76 685.20 speaker3  So you wanted me to draw a, do athletics. Okay.
680.48 687.60 speaker2  got enough time to get onto the road before you can really get to him.
686.20 691.92 speaker0  He's, he's on the road in his car.
687.60 699.56 speaker2  He is pulling out of the police station parking lot onto the road.
698.56 719.84 speaker3  Come on. Uh, Oh shit. Uh, fuck. Uh, we got a, we got a, uh, a wreck in the parking lot. There's a, uh, a guy's just taken off gun in hand. Leo's in a, in a black SUV. I didn't catch the damn plate. I need, I need some help down here guys.
718.84 731.44 speaker0  Everything's happening. It's all happening.
730.44 929.60 speaker2  fence. Keith, as you walk up on the massive piston pig farm, you see a large farmhouse, a small farmhouse, a barn, a warehouse, and acres and acres of land. Leo's old rusty farm truck sits next to the small farmhouse and there is a large SUV next to the large farmhouse. Sitting next to the large warehouse is a line of old school buses, most of which are broken down and have plants and tall grasses growing up in and around them. Go ahead and roll luck for me. That's a 19 on a 60, 19 on a 60. So as you approach, as you're walking up to the pig farm, you feel warmth running under your left foot. As you realize you hear the sound of a gunshot, you look down and see some blood pooling underneath your shoe. Take one point of damage and roll sand. I failed my sanity check. Okay, so go ahead and lose one sanity as well as one hit point. What do you do? So I'm bleeding. I want to see where exactly did I get hit? Right in the foot. Don't pass. Okay. Just meant to scare you a bit. And it's coming from the large farmhouse. And as you look up to see where this voice is coming from, you see a woman in the window of the large farmhouse and she's like holding a rifle. Oh shit. Little Keith Vigna. Holy shit. Yeah. God damn it. And as she runs up to you, she's like, Oh fuck officer. I kicked that shoe off. Okay. And so also can we do this inside? Oh yeah, absolutely. So she'll take you like you can put your arm around her and she'll walk you into the large you would see this place is, yeah, I want to do like a quick look around. It's not too dirty. There's some stuff about, it's not super tidy, but it's not like overly messy. And it's not overly gross in any sort of way. So she'll get your foot up on that ottoman and begin wrapping it. And she says, seriously, officer, I shit, I did not mean to actually hit you. I was just, I didn't even recognize you and I didn't see the uniform. I was just really worried. I, you know, with all, I don't, I don't know, you know, you got to protect your property and whatnot.
928.60 932.60 speaker0  High crime? High crime.
931.60 978.86 speaker2  Oh Jesus. Oh, why is that officer? I didn't say that, but well, I mean, George, George is headed out with Leo down to the police station. So I would assume that you stayed behind to what now? name of yours.
975.70 1010.36 speaker3  search of the perimeter, make sure nothing was up and I was going to get, get back to the station. Yeah, but, uh, I've dropped it as soon as you shot me cause it scared me so bad. And she failed.
1006.88 1036.20 speaker2  human emotions through action and voice. She uh, she buys it. Oh, oh shoot. Okay. Uh, well fuck. I am. Oh boy. Okay. Well, you know, Keith, I knew your parents and you know, I, I, I'd really appreciate you letting this one slide. I think, I think we, I think we're on the same page here.
1033.48 1042.52 speaker3  take a look around, we'll forget that this ever happened.
1037.20 1062.88 speaker2  Uh, so she goes back and as she's walking back to the kitchen to put on a pot of coffee, her phone starts doing the alarm. That's ready to go.
1061.24 1064.88 speaker3  Not really, but I'll drink it.
1063.88 1080.28 speaker2  Okay. That's, that's perfect. I'll be back fairly quick with a plastic cup with iced coffee in it. That's so you can take it to go and kind of looked at you.
1078.84 1087.64 speaker3  to take, take a little peek around. If you got something to do, feel free to go do that and I'll lock up behind you, but I'll
1086.52 1106.32 speaker2  Oh, okay. Okay. Take your time. She, uh, pops out the back door. Okay. Fuck yeah. Free range.
1103.32 1129.26 speaker3  I think I'm going to just do some snooping in this main house real quick. What are you looking for? I don't know. Particularly like anything that just doesn't seem like the pistons would have like, I know in my mind who these people probably are, right. through drawers, but open drawers up, looking through that and just kind of searching this main house at first.
1128.26 1170.48 speaker2  Okay. So this main house is like I said before, it's, it's fairly well kept. It's pretty clear after snooping around for a while that this is where Kathy and George live. And they have an extra bedroom. That's a guest bedroom that is completely neat and unused. There's another room in the farmhouse as well that it is filled with Mary Kay stuff. Okay. Yeah. And you would know Kathy, which is this woman, Kathy Piston. She's a Mary Kay. That's her side hustle. Yeah, absolutely. And she's like very into it and wears kind of an absurd amount of makeup for a pig farmer.
1165.92 1193.44 speaker3  So if I don't find anything of interest in there, I'm going to go over to the small farmhouse, which I assume is Leo's. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1183.12 1222.10 speaker2  As you are going to the small farmhouse, you see the door on the big warehouse shut. There's no one standing around there and you just see the door shut and you walk into the small farmhouse. This is Leo's place and it is quite different. It is a shithole. Filthy. It's gross. He works with the pigs all day and he does not take off his shoes when he gets home. Gotcha.
1221.10 1225.06 speaker3  Yeah. It smells fucking awful.
1223.10 1239.38 speaker2  There's like rancid food in the kitchen. The bathroom and the kitchen are like one thing together. Go ahead and roll search for me. Nope.
1238.38 1251.12 speaker3  Pig shit. Pig shit for days. I get out of there like ASAP and then I want to go.
1250.12 1253.12 speaker2  That's it.
1252.12 1262.98 speaker3  Yeah. Um, since I saw the warehouse door closed, I'm going to go to the barn first and leave the warehouse to be my last place. Okay.
1258.10 1277.10 speaker2  So you would go and open up the barn door. It's two big swinging doors right in front of it. And inside is just bales of hay, a couple of horses. This is like the stables basically. I'm going to go pet one of the horses. Cool.
1276.10 1284.46 speaker3  Cool. Uh, I want to glance around, kind of poke around a little bit. See if there's any, this seems like a good place to hide something.
1283.46 1292.98 speaker2  Sure. Sure. Go ahead and roll search for me again. Shit.
1291.52 1295.80 speaker3  I'm doing some Vigna style police work.
1292.98 1305.70 speaker2  This is some Vigna police work. This is a normal barn.
1304.70 1318.30 speaker3  Yes. I want to go sneak into one of the buses and post up and see if I see anybody coming out of the warehouse.
1314.22 1323.46 speaker2  Where are you going in inside this bus and which bus are you going to?
1322.46 1327.70 speaker3  Okay. And I'm going to just get in there to where like I can just pop down if I see somebody
1326.70 1415.80 speaker2  and hide. Okay. Sounds good. You're kind of looking out the window, uh, in one of the back seats of the bus and you're looking at that door and the door opens and Kathy pops her head out and is scanning. You roll luck. So she kind of scans over to where you're at and you pop your head down just in time. My bus? The bus that you're in the back of. And she sits in the driver's seat. The bus begins filling up with people and you hear voices and it's all muffled and they're all chitter chattering together. And it starts to smell really bad on this bus. And it's not that pig smell from Leo's farmhouse. It's a different kind of smell. It's the, it's the odor of the homeless population who is now residing on this school bus. There are as many people as can fit on a normal sized yellow school bus plus some. Are you looking up how many people can fit on a school bus? God, how many rows are there in a school bus? Okay.
1414.80 1424.60 speaker3  Okay.
1421.52 1453.04 speaker2  to you, but they are so close to you. You're like crouched behind this back seat and they are smashed. the bus begins to move. What do you do? Fuck.
1452.04 1455.60 speaker3  go off. The emergency door in the back.
1454.60 1491.52 speaker2  Fuck yeah. Okay. You reach over and you grab the, the handle of the door in the back and as you open it, the door immediately opens and alarm starts sounding. It's going and you fall out the back of the door.
1488.32 1503.52 speaker3  I got a fucking 99.
1502.52 1558.92 speaker2  It's a critical fail. it a d four for falling out. Uh, you take two damage, you fall and you fall on the exact same foot that got shot earlier and your ankle rolls. And so now it is like almost impossible to use that foot and put weight on it. But as you fall out, the door slams back closed and you hear the alarm stop ringing as it slams shut and the bus peels out on the County road and drives away, leaving you sitting in the middle of the road, which is not actually the main drive that you were on earlier. It's this back way that you didn't even notice before. So you were actually probably half a mile from the warehouse, which is on the far south
1557.48 1587.00 speaker3  part of the property. What's my movement speed at this point. Okay.
1580.40 1591.08 speaker2  And so you multiple times fall over on your way there, but you make it to the warehouse. What do you want to do? I want to see what's in this.
1589.48 1594.32 speaker3  Oh God.
1593.32 1630.00 speaker2  Flashlight on. Flashlight on. It's dark in there, but there's a lot of windows on the top of the building and probably some like sunroofing. This is where all the pigs are. It's an indoor operation. And so inside the warehouse is this massive pig farming operation. There are hundreds of pigs separated into different sections of the warehouse and what looks to be an irrigation system running just above the head of an average man that sprays cool water down into the pins every once in a while. Only pigs in here, right? Yeah. There's just a bunch of pigs and it smells like pig shit.
1626.48 1639.44 speaker3  Are there any sleeping bags or anything like that or were these people, do I think these
1634.32 1657.36 speaker2  no idea how that many people fit in here with all these pigs? Because the rows in between the pig pins are very thin. Well, not very thin, but like one person, right? Two people, not, you know?
1655.20 1661.80 speaker3  I want to do a search roll just to see if I... No. 80.
1660.80 1669.48 speaker2  80? Okay. So you hop around. You can use the pins at this point to get around easier. You don't find anything.
1668.48 1680.40 speaker3  I'm going to hop back to...
1675.04 1689.52 speaker2  We haven't done that yet in this campaign so far because we've never actually used this luck mechanic in our home games before. And so we all keep forgetting about it, but yeah, you can always spend luck.
1686.72 1707.06 speaker3  Wish I would have known about that five minutes ago. When a lot of bad stuff happened. I want to hop back to the house real quick. Okay.
1705.32 1711.92 speaker2  you on your person. And it is Clark.
1710.92 1735.24 speaker0  Oh, shit. Fuck. We got a wreck in the parking lot. There's a guy who's just taken off gun in hand. Leo's in a black SUV. I didn't catch the damn plate. I need some help down here, guys.
1734.24 1872.24 speaker2  Yes. John Lee Pettymore arrives at the hospital in the city, and as you are walking through the parking lot to the entrance of the large building, a man jumps out at you from in between two parked cars. I immediately draw him again and fire. Oh, we're doing this. He's this like weird hunched dude wearing an old tattered robe with a hood that's covering his face, and he says, Oogie boogie there, my friend. You know, as if my day wasn't already busy enough, I'm going to radio this in. Drew. through 12 or whatever it was. I want to get one of them just so we're doing the legwork of checking out local mini storages. Right, so those keys are in Clark Bishop's desk. Vigna threw them to him earlier when you guys were in the station, and Clark has them in
1871.24 1880.60 speaker3  his desk.
1877.60 1882.60 speaker1  within nearby that has G units?
1880.60 1910.60 speaker2  You could ask Tim to do it. G unit. Okay, cool. So. Real quick. Who's Tim? Oh, Tim, the guy who works at the police station who does like everything. Ray? No.
1909.60 1917.24 speaker3  I asked him to do that.
1911.60 1985.08 speaker2  Okay, so as you walk into the large hospital, you see a desk with a woman sitting behind it next to a large Christmas tree and a life-size nativity scene. What do you want to do? I'd like to see Julie Maxwell, please. is an old man with mutton chops and large, thick eyebrows. I immediately hold out my hand and say, hello, Julie. I didn't like her one bit. I'm glad she's gone. Where is she now? She just got up, I don't know, about half an hour ago and left.
1983.20 1989.28 speaker1  to find out where Julie went.
1985.08 2009.72 speaker2  This would take a little time, but you would find out after looking through the cameras, you would see that she walked out the front door half an hour ago, gown open, just heading out into the world.
2008.04 2012.28 speaker1  matching her description.
2009.72 2034.84 speaker2  Not today. The city's pretty rough and tumble.
2027.84 2037.84 speaker1  So if I explain that, do I get any assistance or offers for a squad car to go look for or something? They're busy.
2036.84 2045.64 speaker2  You're a small-town cop. They don't give a fuck. If it's a murder case and we get a hold of her, then we'll let you know. Okay. Well, you have been no help.
2044.64 2079.54 speaker1  Thank you very much. Perfect. I hope no one else dies. How'd you feel if your whole family's faces were smashed or ripped? Okay, so I'm going to take off in my cruiser in the direction that she left and try to look for her, but I also have some other things I want to do while I'm in the city. I'd like to see how close I am to a camera store and how close I am to a dirty dog grooming.
2071.84 2090.64 speaker2  You're pretty close to a dirty dog grooming and there are five dirty dog grooming salons
2085.88 2104.44 speaker1  Does John Peter's dirty dog loyalty card mention a specific location? No. Okay, so I'm going to head to the camera shop. You get a call.
2099.44 2118.20 speaker2  Yeah, I think we actually clocked your suspect in a gown. She seems to have just stolen a black SUV and is heading west on the highway. All right.
2115.20 2147.88 speaker1  I don't give a shit about jurisdiction. Hell yeah. I'm going to chase her. Yeah, I'm going to chase her down. Sounds good. She's heading for contention.
2146.88 2162.68 speaker2  Okay, nice. So you speed back into town and you don't catch up with her on the highway because it seems she got a pretty good head start on you.
2161.04 2179.80 speaker1  The truth, really.
2178.32 2194.20 speaker2  You roll into contention. You drive straight down the main road, right down to the police station.
2192.20 2214.28 speaker1  My luckier dice. 14. Hell yeah.
2213.28 2239.08 speaker0  Come on. Uh, oh shit. Uh, fuck. Uh, we got a, we got a, uh, a wreck in the parking lot. There's a, uh, a guy's just taken off gun in hand. Leo's in a, in a black SUV. I didn't catch the damn plate. I need, I need some help down here guys.
2232.04 2250.44 speaker2  You see Leo piston in the driver's seat of this SUV with a horrified look on his face. And you see the barrel of a pistol pressed firmly against the back of Leo piston's head.
2249.44 2250.44 speaker1  Okay. How can you have enough drowning out all the notes.
