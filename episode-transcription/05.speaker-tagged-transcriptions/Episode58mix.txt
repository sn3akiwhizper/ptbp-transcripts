0.00 244.08 speaker0  Ho, ho, ho, my babies, it's your number one gift giver and home invader, Wolfy Claws. And I'm here to throw copious amounts of garbage down your chimneys at night, whether you've been naughty or nice. Hope you put that fire out, because my gifts of garbage are good and grease-filled, baby. And as always, we are delivering all that unholy holiday cheer live from 694.2 PTBP. What's that smell in the air? Is it holiday cheer and joy? Is it the smoldering ashes of a house I accidentally ignited into flame from throwing greasy garbage down their chimneys? No, it's Howlin' with Wolf. This week we got a new Howlin' with Wolf, and it comes from someone very close to my heart. Dear Wolf the Dog, You are handsome, you are beautiful. When you command, people obey. You are the master of trash, a savant of meat drippings, an academic of pandemics. Just wanted to let you know how special you are to everyone, especially me, baby. With great admiration, Wolf the Dog. Now damn, that was a nice letter. We should get more like that, I think. This kind being must have massive intellect to compose such a letter. If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl, remember to hit us up on one of the various forms of social media and tag us. Or give us a 5 star review on iTunes and all that jazz and send us a damn email for wolf's sake. Pretendinpod at gmail dot com, baby. Also if you love the show like I do, consider becoming a subscriber over on patreon dot com slash pretendinpod. We got some nice exclusives for y'all over there. Speaking of transition, it's the news. Leon Dunn murdered some cops while leaving Bruce Robin's office. The city PD tried to catch them contention boys, but the fast and furious car chase ended after Keith threw a shotgun at the lead car so hard it buried itself into the driver, causing the CPD cruiser to swerve and flip an absurd number of times. The wake of destruction got to John and Clark, and they dived into their own consciousnesses, unresponsive and chanting the numbers that translate to Bruce Robin. Right before they snapped out of their weird trance-like state, Keith learned an ominous fact from Leon Simpson. Apparently Clark Bishop is the overseer, and in his future he will go back to the past and found the circle of knowledge. So uh, that's fun. Y'all it's time to introduce a new one never heard before on this station. It's my favorite Christmas song of all time, one that inspires joy and happiness to all far and wide. No matter the dimension, no matter the timeline, it's Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is Kudzu With No Backbone.
234.80 263.52 speaker1  Simpson and Keith Vigna, and you are in a parking lot of CSU, City State University. And Leon and Keith are just, Keith especially, is just... I'm staring at you, mouth agape, like... Keith? Um... Uh... Do you know? Know...
262.52 274.50 speaker0  Where are we?
272.66 284.18 speaker2  Time for you guys to head on out.
279.50 300.58 speaker1  If Keith and John want to go in from this way, her dorm is this next one right up here and he points at a building, and you see the entire campus of CSU is dripping in holiday festivities.
299.58 325.30 speaker2  in it. Bruce Robin. Nah, that didn't sound like us. Over and over and over again.
324.30 366.14 speaker1  scene. Police tape is up and there are little, like, placards, you know, for evidence all over the place and spray painted all over the walls and even, like, on the bed sheets and, like, pillowcases and the desk and really anything. Spray painted on there is 1-5-2-2-5-1-8-1-9-5-5-1-8. I decoded that.
363.10 370.46 speaker2  Look at those numbers and I think that's what it called you.
368.34 379.34 speaker1  How, that wouldn't make...
375.02 385.10 speaker2  of this podcast?
384.10 404.18 speaker1  I look at you. Why won't nobody look at me? side and get into the administration building.
401.98 414.14 speaker2  Do you think I'm the overseer? Yes.
408.54 438.58 speaker1  Clark, it's better not to think about it too much right now as it seems to be... I don't know. I was just telling Keith here. I don't know if I believe in destiny anymore, but if the prophecies are true, then you will eventually start the circle of knowledge in the past. That sounds right.
434.82 469.74 speaker2  If Leon's right, that's, I think that's you. Why'd you tell that girl to kill herself, man? Do you remember what was written in that book?
467.54 477.08 speaker1  I mean, Clark is our greatest asset.
473.14 494.98 speaker2  that's kind of the whole point of the circle of knowledge, wasn't it to bring about the Overseer?
493.98 498.46 speaker1  now.
494.98 522.08 speaker2  Clark throws up. Leon, there's a huge flaw here in this whole thing. I don't do magic. I don't know how to do magic. Do you know how to do magic? I didn't even know magic was the thing until I saw Old Me. Does the circle know magic? Can you teach me to do magic?
521.08 529.88 speaker1  I've never seen... Where is your sense of wonder, Leon? Honestly, I've seen too much to wonder about anything anymore.
528.38 536.00 speaker2  Have you talked to the Old Me? Do you know that Old Me has been sticking his hands in our daily lives for the last few days?
535.00 542.36 speaker1  No, what?
539.92 548.16 speaker2  Yes, but hold on, what was the other thing? That's what he's been doing to us.
543.52 571.24 speaker1  I watch that every night before I go to sleep, but I haven't seen... You're saying that...
558.68 584.80 speaker2  What rude monkey is Old Clark?
579.96 593.70 speaker1  hear about the ways in which Old Clark has put his fist inside of you. Don't get weird with it. No, no, no, you know what I mean.
589.68 622.38 speaker2  It seems as though he's been helping us in sort of indiscriminate ways. He tried to warn us a long time ago when none of us were around. He went and talked to Drew and told him something terrible was going to happen. That was Old Clark? It wasn't me. I thought that was just a double. Oh, man. I don't know how it works. He did something to us. I show whichever one. What's on my chest again?
621.38 626.38 speaker1  Marvin.
625.38 641.24 speaker2  I'm going to show him that one. He branded us with a name. And I hold out my hand too.
638.62 642.24 speaker1  I hold out my hand.
641.24 646.72 speaker2  Look real close. Watch the birdie.
643.24 657.04 speaker1  I hold out the opposite hand to the one they're holding and then smack me with the other one. I don't hit him.
652.84 680.02 speaker2  I don't, I can't, the only thing I can assume is it was magic. He held up a scroll. Joe's asking that. I just assumed it was magic of some kind.
674.46 702.98 speaker1  that we believed and were taught that it did and part of the circle of knowledge is keeping that truth a secret from the general public because the minute that this goes wide, chaos will ensue. Not if he's like regulated, like set up a Hogwarts. That is an extremely good point, Jon. Thank you. Maybe season two.
696.06 707.02 speaker2  Yeah, fuck yeah, Jon as Dumbledore, right in on the discord if you want to see that.
702.98 710.54 speaker1  If you don't think that the overseer would be Dumbledore, then I don't know what to tell
708.02 722.06 speaker2  Wouldn't the overseer be doing more important stuff? He's Voldemort. Yeah. We uh, that's Dewey Jack Black.
721.06 724.06 speaker1  Dewey Finn.
723.06 732.66 speaker2  Sorry.
731.66 782.14 speaker1  I sure don't. We need to get in here. We need to make this quick. So, my plan split up. All right now, Keith and Jon, I think you guys have the best chance at going in and figuring out what happened in the dorm room. Talk to her roommate. Talk to anyone who is friends with her. Try to get the run down. They will have already been talked to by the city police, so you're going to have to convince them that there's a reason that you're re-interviewing them. Clark, we're going to go ahead and sneak into the administration building and pull files. All right?
779.06 791.78 speaker2  Uh, I guess if you say so, if you think that's best. That's what, I don't even know what, what are we, what are we doing, Leon?
786.78 825.66 speaker1  We need to figure out if Harriet Marks is the beginning of this or if she passed it on whatever it is. Perhaps, you know, Bruce Robin quote unquote got it, whatever it is from Harriet Marks. She got it or whatever it is from the Overseer. You guys. Are you saying it follows? I mean, it seems to pass. Any points of the pictures that are in your lap?
821.42 831.78 speaker2  So it gives the name of the last person who had it, is that the theory? We were writing down Bruce. What was Bruce writing down? He was writing down Harriet. Got it.
830.78 850.58 speaker1  I see what you're saying. And Harriet was writing the Overseer. It's just a theory, but if it starts with the Overseer, we need to figure out why you made this happen.
845.30 853.26 speaker2  Let's call him Clark, Clark, Clark, old, let's call him Clark old just so I don't feel like
850.58 874.46 speaker1  you guys are accusing me of shit I didn't do. Your cops do your interrogation work. From what I've heard, you guys are real good at putting guns in people's faces and making I'm like, you don't know a goddamn thing about us. And he just keeps talking.
873.14 883.14 speaker2  I got an idea, fellas. If you take a picture of me and use a filter to oldify me, then you got a picture of me.
882.14 885.26 speaker1  Face app.
884.14 892.06 speaker2  I smile real big. Snap a pic.
890.06 901.22 speaker1  That's the, uh, nevermind. I'm going to cut that. Sorry about the Internet Research Agency. Some Delta Green lore.
899.22 919.38 speaker2  Oh, great. Okay. Well, I guess, uh, should we go to, go to her door? You killed the vibe, nerd. I know.
918.38 923.38 speaker1  captain. Okay. I mean, I guess let's go to her dorm then, John. I'm following you.
922.38 948.82 speaker2  All right.
943.14 964.70 speaker1  John Lee Pettymore and Keith Vigna get out, start walking toward the dorm. Leon puts the car in reverse and starts driving out of the parking lot. I need you to roll either a human or an alertness, whichever is higher.
963.70 987.30 speaker2  I crit pass. I got a one. I got a zero zero one. I think a one is better than a 33. It sounds like it should be better to me. I don't know how I do it.
986.02 1027.90 speaker1  Never apologize, baby. All right, shit. Are you ready for this? I know, but go. You notice Leon's free hand is reaching and he grabs a gun out from under the shotgun seat, like in between the console and the shotgun seat, and he's moving it to aim it at you. And it's not a normal gun. It looks like the tranq gun that he gave you earlier. So instead of him just firing it into you, we are now going to roll against each other, depending on what you want to do.
1026.90 1038.62 speaker2  Fantastic.
1036.90 1052.06 speaker1  He's got a 80% in firearms. No, sorry, 70. So he's going to go down to 30.
1048.38 1062.94 speaker2  I got a straight 30 on a 70.
1061.66 1114.46 speaker1  next to you. And it is your turn to act. I failed too. I got a 94. So that's just fail on fail. So he continues driving without a wrecking. However, the gun is just like being wildly moved back and forth and you've got two hands on his arm and he is trying to muscle back on you. It's his turn. And he is going to try to wrestle the gun away from you. So roll it up again, baby.
1113.46 1117.46 speaker2  It's a 33. Okay.
1116.46 1121.54 speaker1  What do you do?
1117.46 1122.54 speaker2  I rip the gun out of his hand and I pointed at the back of his head.
1121.54 1130.26 speaker1  Leon. Yeah. What the fuck? I just thought it'd be easier if you weren't conscious for this next part. Please don't.
1128.78 1133.62 speaker2  Did you want me unconscious? Yeah.
1131.26 1137.52 speaker1  There's a star.
1136.26 1141.16 speaker2  Can I tell where he's going? Has he left campus?
1139.58 1184.40 speaker1  No, it's a, it's a pretty big campus. So he's just like driving slowly through these stop signs and stuff. I was just doing that for the best. So, okay, so you are, you are essentially, I know this sucks, but I've got a lot riding on you in the future and I thought it would be safest if you weren't around for this next And if you die, maybe the world ends like I don't know, but I need to protect you at all costs.
1183.20 1188.12 speaker2  that means I live through all this. I'm untouchable.
1185.40 1203.32 speaker1  The, I don't know if the future and the past work. I don't know how any of this works. I don't know. I don't know how any of this works and I have to keep you safe.
1202.32 1255.32 speaker2  Listen to me, Leon. I've started to think that maybe this overseer business sounds pretty good to me. that you are saying that I start the circle in the past. I think I'm going to get out of this unscathed. You on the other hand, might want to keep your head down, cause I don't remember Leon being Clark Old's right hand man. Oh, Clark. Joe's gonna say, is it the calm, comfy campground?
1253.66 1273.44 speaker1  You get 10 luck. But first, do you actually, let's go back to what you just said a few moments ago. Do you actually believe that you're like indestructible?
1272.12 1302.48 speaker2  Yeah, I think so. figure something out. I don't know. You know what? Let's...
1298.80 1361.92 speaker1  You actually see a sign on the building that you're heading directly towards and it's the administrative building, which is where you guys were originally planning on going. It's where he said you guys were originally planning on going. doing my job and I... But honestly, if you can prove what's happening here, I mean, I would be, I'll help, I'm interested. Let's just do this. Let's fucking go for it. And he pulls up to the spot right next to the door and... We'll just take care of this first, because I want to see if you can. And then we can head over there.
1360.92 1398.36 speaker2  I like that. How does he get out? Yeah. He hasn't asked for it, you mean? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna just hold on to it.
1397.36 1419.48 speaker1  were in. And you guys look out at the campus of CSU, City State University, and the entire thing is riddled with holiday spirit. There are decorations covering everything. Wreath.
1414.76 1424.52 speaker2  Yeah, there's a big wreath that's just like on the dorm building right in front of you. Lights. Oh yeah. Oh, you know there's lights.
1422.48 1432.64 speaker1  There's like an absurd amount of Christmas lights. They're on every single building up the walls and on every tree on campus as well.
1431.64 1441.54 speaker2  Inflatable minion.
1436.16 1467.88 speaker1  It's Derek and it's wearing the Christmas hat. What is that called? Santa hat? Santa hat. It's wearing a Christmas hat. And yeah, it's arms are just like the only thing that's moving on it. The mascot of City State University.
1466.36 1474.16 speaker2  I'm assuming you have this written down.
1468.88 1484.24 speaker1  Oh yeah, let me just look it up on my computer real quick. It is a Venus fly trap. Cool. That's a native to North Carolina. Well, you don't know where we are. Not North Carolina though, right?
1481.36 1513.68 speaker2  Probably not, but it's native to the city. This is a good podcast, guys. Are there trees?
1506.52 1584.16 speaker1  the dorm room of Harriet Marks, which is 328 Giff's house. And actually you see this building that is right in front of you. It has a sign on it that in big capital letters it says Giff's house, G-I-F-F-S. And the building is covered in a massive wreath that is lousy with lights. Let's go in there up to the third floor, I'm assuming. Room 328. When you guys go into Giff's house, you see that all the lights are out. us? If it had only had one F, you would have said it wrong. That's an opinion. So you guys were going into Giff's house and the lights are out. On your right there is a secretary's desk and there's a computer. The glow of the computer screen is the only light in this room, but you can make out from there that to your left there's like a sitting area with a baby grand piano and ahead of you there is a glass wall of windows with a door leading into that room and then from there there's a hallway that breaks off and it goes left and right.
1582.32 1605.12 speaker2  Baby grand piano is my pop star name.
1604.12 1607.52 speaker1  in the middle.
1605.12 1609.52 speaker2  I'd like to see if I can access this computer.
1608.52 1661.56 speaker1  Yeah, you can hop on there. Any good stuff? Oh, there's a directory you can find out that when you look up Harriet Marks, she lives in 328. Her roommate's name is Amelia Locke and right across the hall is 330 Giff's house, which is listed as show dorm. Like one they show to prospective students on tours, yes.
1659.72 1672.28 speaker2  Does it remind you of the good old days? It does, I want to go back. intense crosstown rival. It absolutely is.
1671.28 1685.44 speaker1  Yeah, it's their big rival. Point! Poinsettia! City University leads the way! Nice!
1684.44 1696.08 speaker2  That's our fight song. I walk to where the elevator is.
1695.08 1735.16 speaker1  you're in. And you can also see it from the light on the vending machines behind you. The walls and the floor of this space are completely covered in numbers, like absolutely riddled in numbers. So many different sequences of numbers, in fact, that you can't make out any specific single sequence. All sorts of materials. We've got Sharpie, paint, spray paint, blood, cum, piss, like there seems to be a smear of shit on the wall at some point. Tell me more about the cum numbers. So the cum numbers, they're dripping, and they were dripping, now they're coagulated
1734.12 1739.68 speaker2  in place. Is there a dorm room near us?
1738.68 1743.12 speaker1  There's actually not, no.
1739.68 1745.12 speaker2  Well, damn, do you think people are still living in this dorm room, or in this dorm hall?
1744.12 1793.20 speaker1  I have no idea. What dorm room are we in her dorm room? but you do see that when you turn to look into the elevator, in the corner that would be out of sight when the elevator door first opened, there is a slumped over body of a student. And the head has been smashed. Her face is no longer a face, it seems to have been hit repeatedly in the forehead and nose. What the fuck kind of hell dorm is this?
1792.20 1795.52 speaker2  Fail.
1793.20 1815.60 speaker1  Go ahead and lose one sanity. We're getting there.
1812.12 1820.92 speaker2  Well, good thing it wasn't Amelia, because that's who I'm wanting to talk to.
1818.32 1822.92 speaker1  Alright, and Thomas, if you could leave the room.
1820.92 1828.76 speaker2  Before we do that, can you tell me what I found on the computer?
1827.36 1836.04 speaker1  Did you want to find anything else? Yeah, like the answer to all these mysteries. But there was a...
1835.04 1849.56 speaker2  Wrong computer. Is there a reason I'm not going with him?
1842.56 1866.12 speaker1  thing was a promotional ad, like a poster, for The Jingle Ball, taking place the night of December 6th at CSU. And it says, follow the scavenger hunt to make your way to The Jingle Ball. Is December 6th the night that... That's the night. Okay. And do we know what date Harriet died? December 2nd.
1865.12 1870.88 speaker2  Okay.
1869.88 1895.76 speaker1  Okay. I mean, we would have gone up together, right? Yep. Okay.
1893.16 1902.04 speaker2  Is this these, those mind control darts?
1901.04 1911.50 speaker1  No. Probably fall asleep for a while.
1910.50 1916.16 speaker2  I'm going to hold on to it then. I don't want you sneaking up behind me and doing it, trying to do it again.
1914.68 1932.80 speaker1  That seems fair. And I don't want to do that to you now. I mean, if you're willing to, you seem down for the cause and with your current knowledge, I think that we're good. All right.
1931.04 1946.20 speaker2  That's what we were looking for, right? Harriet Marks. Let's see what we can find out.
1944.72 1991.24 speaker1  Like it's evening. The sun is going down currently, but there is no one on this campus. are holiday themed decorations obliterating this place. It's almost as if someone like vomited delicious holiday spirit all over for a block square of the city. Just dirty with it. It's dirty with it. It's lousy with Christmas gear. It's like tiny Santa clauses everywhere and menorah, like blow up menorah, just like in
1988.86 1994.82 speaker2  a yard in front of one of the dorms. It's all over the place. It's great.
1993.82 2005.86 speaker1  If you love Christmas... How does Clark feel about Christmas?
2000.14 2026.62 speaker2  He probably has early good memories right up until his old parents didn't have Christmas for him no more. No more Christmas for old Clark Bishop, or young Clark Bishop. A young Clark Bishop still had no Christmas. Old young Clark Bishop.
2020.42 2109.98 speaker1  So when you guys walk in, the administration office is actually open, but inside all the lights are off and there's seemingly no one in here. Do we know what time of day it is right now? The sun is going down. It's about golden hour. It's yay around golden hour. Cool. Take a picture. It looks beautiful. Yeah, you and... It must be. I don't know. I don't know how colleges work. And so let's just hop in there and see what happens. So you guys turn a corner in this unlit corridor and about halfway down the hallway, you see two figures and one of them, you just hear this like voice that is repeatedly just going like, please. Oh God.
2108.98 2111.98 speaker2  Is it the number stuff?
2110.98 2122.54 speaker1  What do you want to do? Well, and then you guys look over and there's a sign and it says like office and there's
2120.56 2128.14 speaker2  We're both still wearing police uniforms, aren't we? Yeah. Sure, we'll approach them. We'll find the records office, right?
2127.14 2184.90 speaker1  Perfect. I'll go get Justin from the other room. and John Lee Pettymore pulls a Sharpie out and begins writing a sequence of numbers. chant. Right. Bruce Robin. Bruce Robin. The elevator door opens and you are on the third floor. It is also completely dark, the lights are all out and it is silent.
2182.14 2198.22 speaker2  I get my phone out to light the hallway. I guess I'll grab John and kind of just drag him behind me.
2197.22 2217.74 speaker1  He does not. Is it unlocked? It is. It is actually wide open as is the door across the hall, 330, which John told you was the
2216.74 2240.74 speaker2  show dorm. Before I go into 328 I'm going to look into 330, what does it look like?
2238.22 2251.34 speaker1  dorm room with their logo all over. And in the middle of the room there is one out of place Casio keyboard with a sheet of music in front of it.
2250.34 2259.42 speaker2  Okay. That way he doesn't escape somehow. Are there numbers on the walls?
2255.74 2313.34 speaker1  There are numbers covering the walls, the floor, the ceiling, and literally like a desk. Was that also in the hallway and stuff? Yes, every single place that you've been so far. Okay, I'm going to go and see what the music is. A set of music notes written on the staff is pictures. And the pictures are seven eggs, a golf ball, a cat, a demon, and an egg. Are they like cartoons or? They are. And John Lee Pettymore begins writing once again on the back of the chair in this room. Bruce Robin in numbers. Is the keyboard on? It is. So poke around.
2310.74 2317.38 speaker2  It's not like fart noises and like bleh, bleh, bleh.
2314.34 2325.94 speaker1  It's more like the, you know how they have like the choirs on there.
2324.94 2331.34 speaker2  it means right now. Sure. I guess I'll take one more look around and then I guess go over to 328.
2330.34 2356.02 speaker1  Okay. dorm room and looking out you can see the whole campus from here and it too is completely, the whole campus is all festive. Like there are lights up everywhere. There's all these different decorations all over the place and in the middle of campus there's a large old bell tower.
