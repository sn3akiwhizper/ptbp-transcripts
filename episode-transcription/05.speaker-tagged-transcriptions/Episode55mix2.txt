0.00 12.88 speaker0  Welcome one, welcome all, welcome y'all, wait a minute, did I say this all before?
9.64 395.92 speaker1  Have I lived this moment in another time? this one for the first time, but a second time, anyway. Speaking of endless cycles of torture that I am forced to relive every week, it's time for Howlin' with Wolf. This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Ian, who wrote a five star review of this show like the sweet, sweet boy he is. Hey everybody, be more like Ian, he writes. Dear Wolf, I hope this letter finds you well. Needless to say, I'm a huge fan of your show. Not only for the soothing sounds you howl through the airwaves each week, your DJing prowess and your spectacularly diverse discography, but you are hands down the most reliable source of news that the mainstream media won't report on, those otherworldly happenings in the town of contention. My neighbor's got a sister in contention, and even he doesn't know what's going on. Then again, he really hasn't been himself since last week when I returned that shiny ball bearing he dropped out in the parking lot. Didn't even thank me, he's usually a pretty chill guy, but the other night he woke up half the apartment complex screaming and carrying on at two in the morning, thrashing and banging around like we're living in college dorms again or something. he was spattered and marinara and holding what looked like a fake spinal cord, he just said, uh, Halloween, and shut the door in my face. It ain't even October, now he just stares at me coldly every time I pass by on my way to the mailbox, sorry, totally got sidetracked there. Anyway, love the show, keep on howling the good howling snapping those pearly fangs at Mark Zuckerberg's milk toast android ass. You're the wolf now, dawg, your friend and admirer, Ian. P.S. If you could do me a huge favor and dig into the deep cuts, I'd love to hear you spin something a little different from the usual setlist. Do you have no backbone by kudzu in your collection? Thanks a million. No, thank you, listener. All-profit news stations are designed to keep you scared and coming back so they can make that sweet, sweet cash money. I like to keep y'all scared, but I do it for free because I'm a true radio journalist DJ of high caliber, and, uh, it gets me off to know the power I hold, and, baby, you know I'm always scrounging for them deepest of cuts when it comes to tunes. I might have a little something special just for you this time. Remember, if you want to write a message for me to read on air, tag us on Instagram or Twitter at PretendingPod, or write a five star review on Apple Podcasts and email us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com. And the conglomerate of pretending to be people want me to keep shouting out that they are taking questions for a third Q&A episode, so if you have questions for any of the mature, most thoughtful adults who make that show, tag at PretendingPod on Twitter or Instagram. There's also a post in the subreddit where you can comment your questions. Or go all out, record audio of you asking a question and send that so they can use it in the episode. Same as the second Q&A episode, this one will be for our honorary police officers over on Patreon who plug the holes of this sinking ship five bucks a month at a time. The anthropomorphic corks who hold this whole thing together currently have instant access Now if you want a question answered but you can't rationalize making room in your budget, fear not. For some of the questions missed on the recording, the boys will journey into the hardline mainframe network and answer right there inside your phone or laptop. Speaking of crawling into other people's business, it's the news. Clock Bishop Keith Vigna and John Lee Pettymore the fourth, in the body of John Lee Pettymore On the backs Drew, on the bottom of their left foot Maggie, on the palms of their dominant hands Tilly, and on the chests Marvin, but Marvin is crossed out. After realizing they have the moments of the, I guess successful, raid on the glass compound, the three former officers from contention began to understand the situation they found themselves in. Clark tried to summon another version of himself, looked a little too deep into his collective unconsciousness and received a phone call from his former boss. Taking us now to the parking lot of the city cemetery where Maggie Cook just assigned the three dilapidated husks of humanity she once called co-workers with the task of taking out Bruce Robin. Ferguson Bean's former business partner is a personal favorite of mine and a brand new single from Kudzu. Y'all ain't never gonna guess what it is.
389.44 412.12 speaker0  So you guys woke up in the tomb of Ari Manstein and then you realized like you do and you realized that Marvin which was carved into your chest or burned into your chest rather is crossed through with the same sort of burning all the way through which we took as a clear
407.04 520.80 speaker2  indication that that was done and we have nothing to follow up on there and you didn't talk about it at all well and then eventually leaving the tomb you ran into the old woman realized that you had been here before the thing that you had been debating up until that point she had seen us run through before exactly and then you almost ruined the entire might do that and I don't understand how uh pushing you to new creative heights by thinking podcast strike boys our characters sit there and wait we're out and no one's allowed to Cook has joined you she has driven up into this parking lot and has given you a job to do which is to take out or essentially murder Bruce Robin full owner of bar Corp and the one-time business partner of Keith vigna's brother Ferguson beans she is sitting in this
516.26 550.72 speaker0  there's something yeah there's something I want to add to that actually that I just kind
544.48 669.48 speaker2  walking back over to join the group after looking at his cell phone and his car there real quick and then I'll explain okay I need Joe to roll an alertness check for me real I've always been this cool I think you've just been too drunk to notice and then she grabs an envelope out of her shotgun seat and she throws it to you right out the window and she looks at
664.48 713.96 speaker0  high-pitched buzzing that I heard she didn't acknowledge she did not got it but it sounded
707.92 755.48 speaker2  operation hole puncher on the outside of it with the logo for the circle of knowledge the circle surrounded by six circles and inside there is a list of nonprofits charities think tanks and
750.60 767.44 speaker3  company has date slash phone that phone number next to it isn't still the case so that was a
761.60 889.96 speaker2  whereas the other one was just a list of companies with a name and her biome got it so inside is a full rundown of bar Corp it's two owners Ferguson beans and Bruce Robin it's three subsidiaries Jesus Christ ministries health and rehabilitation unlimited and the Learning Center and its annual gross profits from the last five years which has been steadily rising last year bar Corp made just over 850 million dollars paid zero dollars in taxes and there's an estimate that this year they will make over two billion dollars you also see that Ferguson beans is marked as deceased his majority share in the company was split between his wife Stacy his daughter Francis and the mill listed in the legal documents this leaves the majority ownership to Bruce Robin there are addresses listed for Ferguson beans home Bruce Robbins home the bar Corp headquarters and all three subsidiaries Jesus Christ ministries health and rehabilitation unlimited and the tell them in character what you know about Jesus Christ ministries that's what I know right that
883.40 940.08 speaker0  we got from the yeah from from the lockers there I sold that me I sold that to a church I didn't know it was to a church I just heard that but my associate had a good had a good connection and it been personally a giant ball monster like how you gonna worry about me selling a little bit of you
934.92 1090.52 speaker3  know contraband some good times I guess I guess we are a little past procedure but I wonder what thing we saw was Marvin and a bunch of people bursting out of a flooded office well we had been in the office when it was flooded and then before right after that we kind of just woke up
1083.24 1110.60 speaker0  silver balls just so you know there could be a silver ball on you right now oh yeah I mean I'm pretty sure I am the silver ball when my Kevin father killed my my err body my first John yeah
1105.84 1188.44 speaker3  little ball that rings that rings a bell actually because I've seen those balls rip spines out of you remember if you were ball you'd be a ball you know you were a ball well hey man being a ball
1184.16 1214.36 speaker0  all just turn around and I'm gonna give you a little John Lee petty more patented neck rub and we're gonna see if I feel anything weird in that spot of yours what if you ball me what if I don't rip and then John Lee petty more gets in there and he's like god damn it's good it's firm but
1206.76 1222.52 speaker3  sensitive it's for the first time in days your attention leaves Clark's shoulders I'm following
1214.36 1260.96 speaker0  your muscles and your bones perfectly and it's just like fuck you feel like a dog basically a expert but John Lee petty more is a back rub expert and I don't see any signs of ball from
1253.56 1318.32 speaker3  rosemary made a move for the gun the tube gun on the desk of Marvin in his office I don't know what out and replaced it he threw the ball at her through the ball at her and it popped her open
1314.48 1328.36 speaker0  one who was turned into a fool the one who got evaporated yeah so she was trying to get that
1323.84 1369.76 speaker3  and I still am about the whole business of her making a move at Marvin Marvin throwing the ball at her like that would do like he knew it would do something but then it I don't know if it did the thing he thought it was gonna do like she pulled the trigger either way based on all those
1359.88 1434.76 speaker0  a sweet nostalgic sigh he's back in his in a human body but he feels like he should be in a gigantic not to murder again I mean I have but I she kind of she kind of addressed it well do you think we
1428.84 1447.96 speaker3  you the story I convinced her to kill my brother and then I killed her so she couldn't tell on me
1441.76 1454.16 speaker0  probably never again let's just never talk about it all cops are bastards me too I don't really
1447.96 1479.08 speaker3  identify as a cop anymore really but uh what what why did you by proxy kill your brother
1471.60 1578.96 speaker0  investigative skills sell some drugs that I found in the course of an investigation that's to a man
1572.56 1678.56 speaker2  it's a exhale II exactly Maggie gave it to me I don't know what we're in here and you guys take off downtown to a two-story brownstone in the city when you arrive you find parking decently nearby and you find the number on the door is 218 but probably more important than that is that there
1673.20 1708.72 speaker0  you guys walk in the stench is the first thing you notice like a dead body would any of you have
1702.28 1873.08 speaker2  gone there's like pallets made all over the place but there's actual human fecal matter just like strewn about seems that people were like stepping in it and tracking it all around the place smells like piss spray-painted on one of the walls Heisenberg is eight one one eight one eight nine that everything that would have been in a place this nice is long gone drawers have been pulled out of cabinets and doors are open everywhere everything is just strewn about and everything the hallway you see there's a few rooms up here in a bathroom and there's just this heavy presence that you've never felt before and carved into the walls in this room that is maybe had been an office at one point in time is the same set of numbers that you saw spray-painted downstairs eight one one eight one eight nine five two zero one three one one eight one one one nine and it
1864.96 1973.08 speaker0  is carved over and over and over on everything in here using a simple substitution cipher with you know one equaling a and so on do I get any new words out of this do I take a break and give wouldn't so I actually I'd be down to spend a few minutes looking at it I don't know we might find it's very elementary once you get right into it so we can probably just breeze through that
1968.12 2022.76 speaker2  could be like the master bedroom or at least the bedroom one of the bedrooms upstairs that's large and has a bathroom attached the bed is gone the bed frame is gone and there are pallets all over is like some rotten food but then there's also like some takeout a lot of like fast food that's
2018.36 2055.80 speaker0  property crimes down here and we might have tracked him to a drug hideout up there in the whatever information you had on that if you could get it to me about who was living there how long it had been in that state as a drug squat whether or not the owner of the residence was participating
2052.12 2160.76 speaker2  I said it wasn't as important as the police tape over the door that doesn't mean it's not important we questioned some of the neighbors and they said that he was going absolutely crazy he was not acting like himself and he was uh had just people coming in at all time of the day and night and just inviting them all in and and then he just disappeared probably two days ago and they haven't amount of time but I you don't want to go in there it is absolutely disgusting they did a number on that place in such a short amount of time I mean it was truly horrific stuff did y'all have any know he's a high profile member of the community and we're just kind of putting it on the back and uh she hey now that's the lead his business partner is also dead oh god tragic so he seems to have been going through some stuff and if you know mental illness is a serious issue here in
2154.84 2244.12 speaker0  if you're not acting normal you know we either send you to a lot of church or we make you feel alienated until you just leave or kill yourself it's the it's the small town way jesus christ our next step we came real close to doing it to you when you first came to the department I tell you
2239.16 2275.64 speaker2  making a final pass through the home favorite uh you accidentally step in a pile of piss
2271.48 2377.08 speaker3  a thing we learned oh yeah we learned that Kathy was kind of running homeless people around at why don't we just call him call robin call robin you could be like do we have his phone number in robin no I haven't but uh you know we're both aware of each other you know I'd give him a call
2373.08 2407.64 speaker0  guys just standing on the street should we walk around the block before we get back in the car
2400.20 2472.92 speaker2  contention uh the filter sickly green on the coloration yeah sickly green tint with heavy grays the streets are covered in trash and spilled liquids and there's a scent in the air like someone left out cheese and a colostomy bag on every corner the faces of the buildings are slathered in billboards and the faces of the people bumbling about are bloated and lifeless in a strange opposition to all this depressive scenery there are beautiful flowers in every shade and shape growing in every otherwise empty alleyway and out of many cracks in the sidewalks
2467.24 2487.00 speaker0  whole massive corporation like that yeah it's crazy right why I don't know something about the
2480.84 2546.04 speaker2  to renovate everything apparently he's gonna make everyone have livable wage and benefits that are realistically priced for all workers uh I guess we're getting better hours and yeah he's renovating all the facilities to be up to code so we're all getting paid during the time off time and a half
2540.12 2694.60 speaker3  uh rosemary if those flowers were always there can you remind me if you said yes or no whether they barcorp do they manufacture something other than these subsidiaries do they do something so I didn't pretty successful I'll see they sell I assume they sell stuff I want to ask this guy that we hoping to get in touch with Robin I had a couple questions because I think it was under odd circumstances that his mother and my brother both recently passed away I was hoping to speak with
2688.48 2716.84 speaker2  understand that you're going through a real trying time right now but Bruce is unavailable is he in
2711.20 2838.28 speaker3  oh oh write down some questions and call back I was just hoping to have more of a conversation is maybe doing some good for this city as well that's what they told the workers that's true
2833.76 2854.20 speaker0  was a man who bought cocaine in a van full of children how do we think that Robin is any better
2848.76 2875.16 speaker3  in the first place and is his heart that full of gold and someone that we trust wants us to kill
2870.04 2895.68 speaker0  know if I do trust this new well it was pretty cool I'll she faked her own death that was right
2892.56 2895.68 speaker2  maybe find out what other stuff the circle in the lodge has been up to the only one trying to
