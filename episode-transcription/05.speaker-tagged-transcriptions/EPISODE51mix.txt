The most recent one is the recently unearthed recording of session zero for this whole damn campaign in which the town of contention is created and the cast discusses their plans for the podcast, well, everybody makes plans, but only what actually happens becomes the news. As of right before sundown, Liz Lonklin had spoken with a strange rambling man in a clearing surrounded by sigils in a circle of a white powder before she ran into Ash Hornbeam, arm still stuck in the tree, coming up with no solution, Ash freaked out and pulled his arm halfway out, his extreme pain tolerance the only thing keeping him conscious. a naked, bloody, muddy man tied to a tree, Jeremy was feeding him sausage toe beans in an attempt to calm his new friend he called Rusty, Ken was not on board with this situation. Judy Krenkelhoff ran off into the woods after losing her shit and calling Shadow a tree, the two of them almost fell into a pit trap but instead found a rather gregarious raccoon that charade style told them to avoid the hand sanitizer and to all get the absolute fuck out of the woods, the three of them walked back to the trailhead where they found Krista Krenkelhoff in the ranger's shack, she gave Judy more hand sanitizer before the three came to the conclusion that the best next course of action is for Krista and Shadow to go back into the woods to find Liz while Judy stays at the ranger's shack with the raccoon and then Judy Krenkelhoff opened the door to the bathroom and she learned exactly
254.20 298.60 speaker1  she knows she knows that the time has come to dance beneath the dance beneath the shadow
290.44 365.20 speaker3  his arm stuck in a tree and the sun goes down behind the trees of the woods and you are now walking through total darkness, you are not on the path of the trail any longer because that is not where Ash Hornbeam resides in the mind of Liz Lonklin and as you're walking through you all begin to realize that you have no fucking clue where you are or where you're going. He's looking at your fingers and like doing that thing where he wraps his lips around and like yeah, he's being a turd, huh?
362.60 375.96 speaker2  Liz you said he was this way, where is he?
369.90 392.28 speaker3  And as you guys pass that corner you see that amongst these trees you can make it out in the moonlight, it happens to be not a full moon but like so close to a full moon that you might be like that's a full moon but then you look it up and you're like it wasn't a full moon.
388.04 400.52 speaker2  Does this ever happen to you where you think it's a full moon and you say oh that's a full
399.52 404.72 speaker3  not.
400.52 412.12 speaker2  Sometimes it's really close to a circle.
404.72 467.86 speaker3  So this moonlight is shining down and ahead of you you see glinting from the moonlight is a frame like of a painting and it's hanging from a tree. Let's just turn around y'all, fuck that. What if we just went the other way immediately? Hornbeam, and Jeremy Pettymore are out in the woods.
466.34 501.34 speaker2  Simpler happier times.
492.02 525.74 speaker3  As you're looking up from your stream of urine, you see the frame of a painting hanging in the woods. It's about 25 yards away from you and you can see that it looks as if there is nothing within the frame.
519.22 528.38 speaker2  I'm going to approach it a little bit, that's weird, who put a frame out here in the woods?
525.74 536.70 speaker3  Go ahead and roll alertness for me.
532.86 544.30 speaker2  I pass a 27 on a 50.
543.30 583.72 speaker3  up. It looks almost as if what's behind this frame that's hanging isn't the same as what you can see through it. You slam and as you walk to the side, you see that beyond this frame is a cabin sitting
580.02 604.22 speaker2  Ken wants to push his hand through the frame, can he?
595.62 622.34 speaker3  As you approach the frame, you make a misstep and your foot is about to land on a wire. There's a wire that is going across the ground that's right in front of the frame and you almost step right on it and you see it's connected to like a stake in the ground and then it goes off to a tree and ties off.
618.06 642.42 speaker2  Okay, I want to abort my mission of the hand through the painting and I want to step back and grab a branch or a rock, anything that's nearby and try and toss it in from where I'm standing.
635.94 656.08 speaker3  painting and strikes directly into a tree that is five feet away from you and you think if you would have been standing there when you stepped on this wire, you would have gotten a face full of splinters and probably a back of the head full of splinters as well.
652.14 663.34 speaker2  And it came out of the frame, like I couldn't tell where it came from. You couldn't, but it busted through the frame.
662.34 676.96 speaker3  Yeah.
675.96 713.10 speaker2  It can't be real. I've just not gotten enough sleep tonight and it doesn't exist.
705.10 724.54 speaker3  As well as this large, bloody, muddy man who is at the end of Jeremy Pettymore's rope. I'm so sorry. Rusty.
723.54 752.30 speaker2  Jeremy! Don't. Go. You recognize that frame? I didn't, I didn't, I didn't think it was real. I didn't think it was, I just thought I was, just hadn't had enough sleep that night.
745.52 767.36 speaker3  Looking down where Ken Krenkelhoff is pointing, you see that right before this frame that's hanging there is a trip wire on the ground tied to a stake in the ground and the other end of the wire goes to a tree that is nearby.
761.90 775.68 speaker2  So they wanted to distract us with the frame and trip us up with the wire. Stand back, stand back. Rusty, come here boy, come on.
772.32 793.08 speaker3  And I go ahead and throw a log and show them. When Ken Krenkelhoff throws a small log onto this trip wire, a long wooden spear flies through the canvas of the frame and directly into a tree 10 feet away from you guys.
791.20 808.20 speaker1  Whoa, that was cool.
799.36 831.24 speaker2  I, a couple of years ago, I was, I had to pee and I came over here to pee and I saw, I saw it then. I didn't think it was real. I didn't, I didn't, I just pushed it out of my memory. I didn't, but it's real. It's there. You guys see it, right?
824.56 836.24 speaker3  You now see there's a cabin in the woods on the other side of the frame. Oh my God, Zach. That's already a movie. I think it's a lot of movies.
835.24 838.56 speaker2  Did you not know?
836.24 840.60 speaker3  Zach, that's a name of a literal movie.
839.60 845.60 speaker2  There's a movie called. Fucking beautiful idiot. Cabin in the woods. That's a very popular movie.
843.60 852.80 speaker3  Are there any eldritch gods in it? I think so, yeah. Actually, kind of. Oh, fuck.
851.40 854.80 speaker2  If you want to start over, we can. Let's just go back.
853.80 873.04 speaker3  This is so embarrassing for you.
872.04 877.04 speaker1  Oh. Got him. FBI.
876.04 880.04 speaker3  Got him.
878.04 888.04 speaker2  Busting makes me feel good.
887.04 895.04 speaker1  Sorry.
893.04 928.04 speaker3  It's middle schoolers and ghosts. Hey, Jeremy Pettymore, how do you feel about the fact that Ken saw something out in the woods a couple years ago and didn't say anything to you? But right now, he's very much in the moment.
927.04 933.04 speaker1  Cabins in the woods?
932.04 940.04 speaker2  there. It's just when you look through here. Nope. Oh, that's not the case?
936.04 943.04 speaker3  When you look through on the other side this time, there is a cabin.
942.04 945.04 speaker2  Go ahead and roll sanity for me.
943.04 952.04 speaker3  There's obviously a cabin there, dude.
950.04 960.04 speaker2  A 93 on a 34.
959.04 962.04 speaker1  Oh, boy.
961.04 968.04 speaker2  Yeah.
967.04 998.04 speaker3  Go down to 29. What the fuck? It's come through a couple of times, maybe just once earlier, but you have not seen it. We're going to do bouts of insanity. Do you remember earlier in one of our other campaigns, maybe both of them, what I would have you do is rank fight, flight, and feint. Oh, yeah. From most likely to least likely for your character. So, which would be most likely?
997.04 1002.04 speaker2  Flight.
1001.04 1026.04 speaker3  And the third would be? Feint. All right. What? Oh, God. So, here's what I'm thinking. You just start punching that cabin.
1025.04 1033.04 speaker1  Yeah.
1031.04 1042.04 speaker2  the spear and be ready to fight? Like, I'm amped and stoked to be doing damage now.
1041.04 1054.04 speaker3  was going to be run away. So, fight is going to be run toward.
1053.04 1056.04 speaker2  Someone built that with their hands.
1055.04 1082.04 speaker1  They lived there for all we know. It didn't used to be there. She's like, it's a cabin. Why is it that crazy that there's a cabin there? I'm sure that person that lives there put this frame there. I don't know. It just seems to me like somebody's being a douche who's trying to keep me from performing voodoo on the girl that I'm-
1081.04 1086.04 speaker3  Yeah. Damn, she has such a cooler reason for being in the woods than us.
1085.04 1089.04 speaker1  I'm just pissed.
1086.04 1099.04 speaker3  Why the fuck am I here with these fucking freshmen right now?
1098.04 1104.04 speaker1  Come on, Rusty. I follow after him.
1102.04 1117.04 speaker3  Can't stop, got to fight might be your last words. Roll an alertness check at a negative 40 for being insane. Yeah, there might be.
1116.04 1130.04 speaker2  At negative 40.
1129.04 1144.04 speaker3  on the ground.
1143.04 1151.04 speaker2  I'm going to get out of it. Busting makes me feel good.
1148.04 1251.04 speaker3  You guys actually see him as he's running. Ash Hornbeam, you're standing in the middle of the woods. No fucking clue direction wise where you are from anything in the contention woods. Your arm is halfway in the hollow of a tree. I looked it up while I was editing that episode. a knot? It's a hollow and we both used the word hollow within 30 seconds of not knowing what it is. Okay. Well, perfect. Your arm is halfway into this hollow of this tree. The rest of your arm that you can see up to your elbow is muscle and a thin layer of membrane You were in nursing school for like four months. What's that sin you called the white stuff? Aphasia. Aphasia. No. Fascia. F-A-C-I-A. F-A. Yeah. Fascia. Fascia.
1250.04 1253.04 speaker2  Fascia.
1252.04 1257.04 speaker1  Let's move on. It's not like that would have been ripped away.
1255.04 1336.04 speaker3  Like the brine of an orange or the pith. I mean, so. Oh yeah. Ew. Gross. You can see this juice. Think about that. And the sun goes down behind the trees in the distance. And you are standing all alone in moonlight. Someone is nearby. I wait silently. He's wearing a black suit, a white shirt, and a bolo tie. He is in his late 20s, early 30s maybe. He has a very, very bitchin' mustache. He's pretty fit. His pants are a little too tight. And he flashes an FBI badge as he approaches. Name's Agent Kevin. I need you to tell me what you're up to with your arm stuck in this tree out here in the woods. Ash just looks down at his arm. I need a little bit of information before I can help you.
1335.04 1356.04 speaker1  Why? Because I put it in here. And the more I pull out, the more skin gets ripped off. I just, I don't know what to do.
1355.04 1387.04 speaker3  willing. So he begins, he has some ointment that he puts on your arm, and then he wraps a cloth around it, and he's like, that should help start the bleeding for now a little bit, but I need some more information. What were you doing out here in the woods? You know there's people missing, right?
1382.04 1390.04 speaker1  shine out, and I just point to it, and I look at him with wide eyes.
1389.04 1403.04 speaker3  That's not an answer, though. Why'd you come out to the woods, anyway, in the first place?
1401.04 1408.04 speaker1  we just camp. I was just trying to camp, but we found...
1406.04 1424.04 speaker3  You decided to camp when there were people missing in the woods? You decided to come out here and camp, anyway? Doesn't seem very smart. I'm in high school. I see that.
1417.04 1430.04 speaker1  I wasn't going to stop camping every year if people are missing. I don't... I'm invincible.
1426.04 1456.04 speaker3  Roll a persuade. He's going to roll human against you. You're not telling me the whole truth, son. I can see it in your eyes. Something scared you. You knew about something like this before you came out here. What's your deal? We come out here every year to find something.
1455.04 1517.04 speaker1  What are you looking for? Ash looks down at his arm and he sees the first aid, basically. Sure. He says, I'm looking for Madge. Who's Madge? It's just a while back we heard about a woman in the woods and at first it was just kind of an excuse to come out and camp every year, but every year we started believing in it And we're out here looking for her. Two of my buddies are, I don't know where they are now.
1515.04 1540.04 speaker3  Shit. Alright. Thank you. And he walks up behind you and you feel the metal of a gun up against the back of your head and his hand is trembling. An instinct kicks in.
1538.04 1578.04 speaker1  His right arm is in the tree. His left arm reaches into his pocket, pulls out a lighter and then he reaches in to his inside of his jacket, pulls out a handful of firecrackers and in one quick motion lights the lighter, lighting five or six firecrackers. is going to get hurt, holds the lit firecrackers on this guy's head and waits for them to explode.
1571.04 1612.04 speaker3  I'm going to go ahead and roll some dice here to see what Agent Kevin decides to do. As soon as you do that, he pulls the gun back down, grabs the firecrackers in your hand and he throws them with your hand and then he stands up in front of you face to face. Alright, you're a fighter. We could actually use another set of hands. Well, I guess maybe just one will do. I'll be back.
1607.04 1622.04 speaker1  He reaches back into his jacket and stares him in the eye.
1618.04 1722.04 speaker3  and he turns back and looks at you with this wry smile. Yeah, we're going to need some thinking like that for tonight. And then we flash back into the history. The pages on the book turn backwards as this, you know, fluttering music happens behind us and we travel back into time when Ash Hornbeam is an even younger boy and we see the front of the Hornbeam home. What kind of house do the Hornbeams have? He's wearing one of those like crisis blankets and he's got some hot cocoa in his hands and there's an officer from the contention police force there talking to him.
1717.04 1848.04 speaker1  I think it was two voices, maybe three, but I'm pretty sure two men's voices. He takes them to coin shows and shows them off and he's got some real valuable stuff down there. Ash Hornbeam is home alone watching TV and he sees an ad, made for TV ad kind of thing, for something he really wants to buy. It was like a CD player, I think, that he wanted. Three disc changer. Three disc changer for how much it cost. His allowance was not going to pay for it. It was my birthday. He knows which ones were more valuable, so he just took a handful, not the whole thing. He didn't need $40,000.
1844.04 1861.04 speaker3  I mean, you got paint cans that are hanging from strings.
1854.04 1963.04 speaker1  So yeah, I found some paint cans in the garage and some hammers and tied strings to them. I learned how to do a trip wire when I was in the Boy Scouts. So I did that by the stairs and when they were coming up I threw marbles down the stairs and they fell down and then they were mad. So they were coming after me. And then the second one came up, the shorter one came up and the other trip wire. Yeah, the second trip wire that I did, the hammers came and whacked him on either side of the head and he fell back down and got paint all over him. And then I yelled that I was going to call the police and that I had a gun. And then, yeah, then I called you guys. But it went all over him and the buckets on his head so he can't see anything. He walks into the wall and falls down. Less tall, still tall. Okay. One was ugly. The other one was even uglier.
1961.04 1977.04 speaker3  Well, the most important thing is that- And a beard. Oh, he's got a beard too. Okay, well, this is really narrowing it down. Well, the most important thing I believe is that you feel safe here.
1973.04 2011.04 speaker1  Yeah, I think I've got to unbuby trap the rest of the house. So don't go walking upstairs or anything. But yeah, I feel safe now. I think I can defend myself. I think my parents are on their way back home too. Hey, Luke. Yeah. Yeah, he's got it. He carries it everywhere he goes. He's got Def Leppard on there. And then he's got a Madonna album in it too.
2009.04 2046.04 speaker3  Fucking Def Leppard. Alrighty, cutting back to present day or whatever your present day is. Cutting back to Ash Hornbeam with his arm stuck halfway into the hollow of this tree. This man's smile fades as he turns. Agent Kevin walks away from you back into the darkness of the woods.
2035.04 2074.04 speaker1  But he looks back down at his arm, looks at the tree, and just punches it with his left arm and looks down and defeat.
2066.04 2130.04 speaker3  And you see from the direction where Agent Kevin walked away, he's walking back and there's another figure with him. And as they come into focus, you see that it is a woman. She is wearing a black suit, a white shirt, black tie, and she is holding a machete that is glinting in the moonlight. And as she's walking toward you, you can hear she is chanting while she rubs one of her hands over this blade. And as she gets closer, you see she is smiling a cold, vacant smile behind asymmetrical bangs that are covering one of her eyes. And the two of them finally get up to you.
2121.04 2161.04 speaker1  Finger guns with his free arm and the hand that is stuck inside of the tree also finger guns. Ash winces a little bit from using his muscles in the tree. It kind of digs in just a little bit. But the wink and the free hand finger gun make up for the pain.
2154.04 2571.04 speaker3  And she lifts this machete that is glinting in the moonlight over her head and she brings it down swiftly right at your forearm. And you step back away from the tree and immediately out of shock reaction, you look at your forearm. And not only is the end of it completely cauterized, but it starts to grow back. And your forearm literally remolds itself into this kind of long stump at the end. So you don't have your hand, there's just this kind of long stump, but it's still this well-formed skin. And then from halfway up your forearm to about your wrist, it's still raw and red. And like, you know, you can see the muscle and tissue and stuff. She says absolutely nothing. She just like smiles at you and then turns around and starts walking the other way. Agent Kevin throws his arm around you. And he leads you along with Agent Karen to a black sedan sitting next to a four-wheeler in the middle of the woods. And you can see through some of the brush and trees, there is a cabin and it's a stakeout, baby. Hell yeah. And I believe she was singing a song about death. She's like folded arms walking and the sun goes down behind the trees in the distance. She's like, oh, is that Liz? Krista immediately takes off into the brush of the woods with the flashlight kind of bouncing off these trees. Total darkness except for the moonlight and this flashlight. Yeah, absolutely. You've got the things dangling from your hands and you're like waving them back and forth and just kind of like whimsically running through the trees. And so since you don't care, I'm going to have you roll your alertness at negative 40 as you just put no effort into running through all these woods. What's your alertness normally? Oh, bummer town. So you have a zero. So, uh, let's see if you, if you roll an art one, that's a success. And you see the flashlight go completely dark as you feel a rope tighten around your ankle. And in this moonlit darkness, you lose control of your body and you lose your bearings completely as this rope hoists you up into the air upside down, hanging by one foot. The blood immediately begins rushing to your head and a bright light blinds you momentarily before Krista Krinklehoff turns the flashlight on herself under her chin like it's spooky story time. From your personal hems, I can assume and do hope that a lack of existence is your preference. Then another, then another and another as the limbs extend toward your pinata like hanging body. The camera pans down to watch the long shadows play out this grizzly scene on the detritus below. So just imagine that feeling inside that you have like when your ankle would get grabbed is the exact horror that you feel as you're standing at the entrance of this bathroom that is attached to this shack at the trailhead of the contention woods. And the body is Buzz Woodrow, if you will, and it is lifeless.
2569.04 2577.04 speaker2  Okay. I got a 20. No way. That's incredible. That's a success.
2576.04 2607.04 speaker4  Oh yay. Good.
2597.04 2672.04 speaker3  You see the exact brand of chapstick your mother, Krista Krinklehoff uses, has rolled behind the toilet of this place. Wait, you had a 32 in first aid? Oh, I did say sanity? Do you mean first aid? So now roll first aid for me. That's what the raccoon says with its arms.
2671.04 2674.04 speaker1  Cool. I follow him.
2673.04 2692.04 speaker2  I'm losing my mind.
2686.04 2714.04 speaker3  There's one light that overshadows the entire parking lot and it's flickering. You turn the corner on the other side of the shack and looking down the trailhead, a lightning bolt flashes in the distance. And it's just enough to light up a blood-covered Krista Krenkelhoff who is walking directly toward you. The wonders of the wonders of the shadow of the moon.
