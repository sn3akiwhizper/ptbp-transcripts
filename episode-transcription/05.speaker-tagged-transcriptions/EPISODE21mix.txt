0.00 52.82 speaker0  Hello friends engulfed in flames, it's your local firefighter Wolf the Dog and I'm here to spray your burning bodies down with all the hot gossip and news from Contingent at 694.2 BTBP my babies. Now this week on Howlin with Wolf, your firefighter Wolf the Dog read some dope shit on the Glass Canon Podcast subreddit, user BFEvans19 recommended 694.2 BTBP writing, among other lovely things they quote, wanted to bring these guys to everyone's attention because I think they bring the same energy to gaming that the GCP does and I expect that a lot of GCP fans would
51.30 62.14 speaker1  Wolf the Dog.
56.70 118.54 speaker0  Last time was basically combat from the time the Robotman blasted the door from its frame, to when the Robotman almost cut off Officer Bishop's arm, to when the Robotman froze at the command of Officer Pettymore, to when the Robotman's torso flew out the window gripping the throat of Officer Vigna. Thank beans, he poked that terminator top in the eye just in time to escape before the metal fella exploded like fireworks. Speaking of fireworks, we got a musical mortar for y'all today and they're here to blow y'all's
115.34 125.30 speaker1  I got shit on my balls, you're exactly right. I was leaning forward. That's good luck.
121.54 134.50 speaker2  Well, it took me like three wipes of just my balls to get the poop off of them. Because it like hit full on, I was like, oh, I don't know that that has ever happened to me before.
131.18 151.30 speaker1  I think it's because it's a hot day and I'm wearing black jeans, so I had long balls.
145.94 204.58 speaker2  half and a small jetpack began shooting flames from the bottom of its torso. It grabbed Keith by the throat and flew through the window of the living room into the front yard. Keith bit into the mechanical hand and two of his teeth broke off. Keith then poked its one good eye. The thing dropped Keith onto the front lawn and then flew up into the night sky where it exploded like fireworks. What do you do? Yeah.
192.54 230.74 speaker1  and then dropped on the ground, I lay down and just kind of like, oh, and just like, if you can in post, just repeat that like eight or nine times. You need to role play that. I want to make my way to the front window and just look out. It didn't take you.
225.18 253.78 speaker2  As you look out, the window is completely broken open and you know, some wind is hitting the curtains and blowing them about and the cool night air is blowing in on your face feel the extreme pain this metal man has put you through.
250.98 271.14 speaker1  That metal man put me through extreme pain. Would first aid help me at all since I'm not like bleeding or anything, I'm just...
268.22 275.54 speaker2  All right, go ahead and roll first aid for me.
274.54 278.14 speaker1  Okay.
275.54 284.34 speaker2  So I just casually drape it over the blood.
278.14 325.18 speaker1  I would like to pull off my cell phone and call the EMTs and have them roll first aid on us. into the house or close to the house. That way any falling debris doesn't hit me from the beautiful explosion that just happened above me. him, grab his shirt, and try to finish what he started. I got a 31 on a 60 for first aid. All right, roll a d4.
324.18 328.18 speaker2  Three hit points back.
327.18 351.18 speaker1  Thank you. You owe me. That's what any a contention PD officer would do. I would hope. And I start to laugh and then immediately my ribs just hurt and I lay on the ground.
349.62 356.18 speaker2  He's like five feet away from you. Oh. No. No.
355.18 391.06 speaker1  Keith, patch me up. Help me up. Grab my left arm. Yeah, I mean we all were. What happened specifically to you so that I can first aid you and maybe get you a couple hit points back? He tried to pinch my ribs together, but a lucky surgical screw.
390.06 398.10 speaker2  side.
395.46 460.06 speaker1  Can I tell, is it like broken the skin or is it like... Yes. There's a hand in me. Okay. Tried to make me its puppet. I am going to attempt first aid on him as well. I would like to wait for the EMTs. Yeah, I'm going to wait for them too because there's nothing. I look down at my side, my just side is bruised. So either he was a robot or... I'm pretty good at his job as a firework technician. I crit pass. Shit. Ooh, pass.
459.06 462.06 speaker2  I failed.
461.06 465.06 speaker1  Because I was first hand. Saw it. Clark, you lose.
464.06 469.06 speaker2  No sanity. I get it first hand.
468.06 471.90 speaker1  First hand.
470.50 514.54 speaker2  I'm gonna lose one sanity. When you walk over and sit down at the piano, you start playing it, but no sound comes out. And when you kind of lean forward and looking inside, there are no strings inside this piano. Can I do a search to see what I do see? Yeah. He rolled an 80 on his search. You see the inside of a piano.
513.06 542.18 speaker1  Is this a guitar? So I want to stand up and I want to open the bench that I'm sitting on.
540.38 604.70 speaker2  Yeah, I'd do that. You kind of remember reading music and you can kind of plunk around on this thing, but it's honestly, it's really hard to play music when you can't hear the music. Is there anything else in the bench? No, it's just that one piece. I want to hobble over to the coffee table and you mentioned there's a tube. Exactly. Inside is just a rolled up paper, a bunch of paper that's all rolled up. When you unfurl it, you see these are blueprints for a place called Calm Comfy Campground. Blueprints. It looks like there is a large lake noted that it is called Lake Calm with an island on it.
602.70 613.70 speaker1  It's spelled with C's, right?
606.38 676.02 speaker2  On the island is one large building with six small buildings surrounding it. Ew. Ew. three piece blue suit on his upper body and no clothes on his lower body. see that the bathtub is a bit dirty.
675.02 694.02 speaker1  in that bathtub, buddy. We're going to scare you up another change of clothes. Why don't you just get everything on you wet and scrub that all off and we'll talk in a Does the water still work? Did artillery shells take that out or just give that faucet? Just try to wash the shit off yourself. Oh, no.
693.02 697.58 speaker2  It doesn't look like it. It's getting hot very quickly.
696.58 699.58 speaker1  Well, there you go.
698.58 701.58 speaker2  It smells great now. The aroma.
700.58 703.58 speaker1  Good luck, Randy. I closed the door.
702.58 710.94 speaker2  All right. Maybe hit that fan on the way out.
709.94 715.62 speaker1  of hit the fan.
714.62 717.62 speaker0  an office.
716.62 728.82 speaker1  Gotcha. Was there a fan in Randy's pants because he shit his pants twice. Yeah. That was a weaving avenue. Cut that out.
727.82 745.50 speaker2  Yeah. Not a joke. Yeah, it's okay.
741.42 755.82 speaker1  It's okay if this one sucks.
751.82 776.70 speaker2  It's only one story and there's no basement to it. It's a two bedroom, two bath. Everything is fucking immaculate. This is an extremely clean house. As you're going through stuff, it looks like James, who lived here, lived very minimalistically.
775.70 805.18 speaker1  and a piano. Yeah. He spent all of his money on nice things. He has no furniture, just impressive for us all right. He was a collector. Clark, I don't know if you've ever thought about getting into contention real estate, but this place is now officially a fixer-upper. The owner's dead. We've got the estate agent in the bathtub with shit all over his pants. I think we could negotiate a pretty good deal on this if you ever want to. Yeah, all you got to do is rebuild the entire home.
802.62 818.86 speaker2  Keith, I'm not trying to get in on ... I'm sorry, man. I don't want to buy a house with you.
816.62 819.86 speaker0  would pertain to maybe his work at the mill?
818.86 832.66 speaker2  No, nothing. Okay. Yeah. No, this is ... Honestly, it's pretty weird how bare and spartan the rest of this house is.
830.54 837.56 speaker1  Not until we own it.
835.98 861.60 speaker2  probably know how to fix it. My guess is that Clark has a pretty dope savings account because he seems to not spend his money on anything.
855.30 866.46 speaker1  John, I do distinctly remember you hours ago saying the only way to fix this situation is to solve.
864.74 874.38 speaker2  You got to keep your mind open to possibilities. You just got to keep thinking.
868.02 903.38 speaker1  Who is going to buy a house from two contingent PD officers if we don't solve this case? Nobody. All right. That's the smartest thing you've ever said. I agree. I'm not a smart man. It's like ... In reverse. Raising a barn, not in reverse, but in a 90 degree angle. House flipping, yeah. You flip that on its own.
899.42 905.10 speaker2  Actually, house flipping shows would be so much more fucking popular than they are if
903.38 909.18 speaker1  they actually just flip the house, yeah.
908.18 912.18 speaker0  Did you ever see that? Yeah, we moved houses.
911.18 918.98 speaker2  Doing the big, yeah. That's insane. Yeah, where they get the foundation or whatever of.
917.98 937.86 speaker1  I used to see it all the time. I feel like I saw it a lot when I was a kid. The housing bubble, maybe. and now you can't do that anymore, because if it falls off the trailer, the bubble can't protect it. The bubble can't protect it.
936.86 948.18 speaker2  That's it. When I was a kid, I used to always think in any room that I was in, how I would leave That's fun.
945.78 966.38 speaker1  That's dope. Through the door. Yeah. Yeah.
963.10 970.94 speaker2  Higher for the doorknob, and then step over the exit of the doorway.
966.38 971.94 speaker1  If you're like a five or six year old, you could probably reach that.
970.94 976.94 speaker2  It would be a leap. If you were in a foyer, too. Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. You've got a taller ceiling going up.
975.94 983.70 speaker1  You'd be screwing a McMansion. Yeah.
981.70 987.38 speaker2  Love tall ceilings. By the way, the ceilings in this house, very tall.
986.38 989.38 speaker1  Yeah, but they-
988.38 992.38 speaker2  Not the house we're in. The house you're in. Oh.
991.38 1002.86 speaker1  Ew, gross. The house you're in. Okay.
1001.86 1005.86 speaker0  No. Oh, yeah. No.
1004.86 1017.06 speaker1  What is it? Also, are your legs okay? Did you break your leg or something? Was it like- There's two dead people down there.
1016.06 1019.54 speaker2  Oh.
1018.54 1024.66 speaker1  Yeah. How dead were they?
1021.54 1033.42 speaker2  They looked to be maybe a week or two old. No, no. I know what you mean. Yeah, we knew what you meant.
1032.42 1054.90 speaker1  Okay, cool. The all prevailing and inescapable odor of the dead did pervade throughout the house when you fell through that hole, but I just assumed, you know, it was Randy. Wait, so do you think James kept those people down there or do you think- It looks like they fell into the armor trap, right?
1053.26 1057.14 speaker0  You said it was 12 feet, right? Do you die from a 12 feet drop?
1056.14 1060.14 speaker1  I don't think you die. Well, you break your legs and if you're down in a pit-
1059.14 1065.18 speaker0  And then you can't get out, sure.
1064.18 1067.18 speaker1  You could if you were upside down or something.
1066.18 1071.94 speaker2  Yeah.
1067.18 1081.06 speaker1  Well, so that's what I'm thinking is, do you think James could be some kind of crazy H.H. Holmes killer?
1078.22 1084.06 speaker0  go through the pockets before I tried to get myself out of there.
1083.06 1096.02 speaker1  Hold on. Can I get Ramona out of here? Ramona, Ramona, let me hold you while you're going in here, baby.
1094.30 1109.00 speaker2  Yeah, it is, dude.
1108.00 1115.62 speaker1  I forgot all about that.
1114.62 1116.62 speaker0  a man's grave.
1115.62 1119.62 speaker1  Doing more like a man's grave. Yeah.
1118.62 1129.82 speaker0  Fuck. symbols in their pockets. It's the circle with the circle surrounding it.
1128.38 1157.02 speaker1  The six around them, yeah. Where was the CCC? Does anybody know where that is? Oh.
1156.02 1177.54 speaker2  Randy might. it smells just awful.
1175.98 1250.66 speaker1  You doing okay in there, buddy? Okay, why don't you just try to rub your hand over it and get some of that shit out of the Do you have any- Okay, listen. Don't worry about that. CCC. Calm Comfy Campgrounds. No. Okay, well thanks for your help, buddy. like you're at pants stage yet if you're still at drain shit stomping stage. The water is no longer- We're definitely not getting you socks. Okay, well, yeah, just keep that up, I guess. All right, well hey guys, yeah, he didn't know anything about that. What is that smell?
1248.10 1258.94 speaker2  turned, you know, whatever color.
1254.50 1280.22 speaker1  outside and wait for the ambulance, because I think I'm gonna throw up, and I feel like if I throw up, the pain from my ribs is gonna make me throw up. on the ground.
1276.66 1282.86 speaker2  your cruiser is, because your cruiser is in the yard. Correct, I might know.
1281.42 1287.22 speaker1  The cool way to park.
1285.78 1297.90 speaker0  I'm in a lot of pain.
1293.38 1307.78 speaker1  and call the EMT guys over, and I put them in Clark's direction because I feel like he has the biggest injury.
1305.54 1317.58 speaker2  It hurts real bad too. What happened tonight, guys? No, you've asked me that before.
1315.82 1362.94 speaker1  This is just what I sound like. No. we need help. like, hmm?
1361.62 1378.74 speaker2  you at the same time.
1376.46 1394.26 speaker1  back to full health. Final Fantasy. That was a Final Fantasy joke. I win 95.
1393.06 1407.78 speaker2  I'm at 12. Keith regains one hit point. God dammit. And Clark regains four hit points. Nice.
1406.78 1433.02 speaker1  four back, huh? I'm just kidding. Just kidding, I'm good with six hit points. We've explored the tuxedo statue. Did we check out the painting yet? Yeah, we checked out the painting. Remember it had all the, uh, we bonded over the bomb making.
1432.02 1439.58 speaker2  That's right.
1438.18 1443.90 speaker0  Who do you guys think her is?
1442.90 1457.04 speaker2  I have 40.
1451.62 1459.04 speaker1  If we can like stick it into the database and see if it's DNA that pops up of anybody
1458.04 1463.44 speaker0  I want to do that. I want to run in there and take a sample of the blood that says, stop her.
1462.44 1467.56 speaker2  Do I need to roll for that?
1466.56 1492.30 speaker1  That's very easy. Yeah. So I go into the, um, the inside where all the strings would be and I'm just feeling around for like loose keys. I run my hands over the keys. I'm just kind of checking everything again thoroughly, but this time I did get a crit success. 33.
1491.30 1529.54 speaker2  You did indeed. And as you are looking through the empty piano, you would make note of the fact that there were piano strings in here at a certain point in time. However, those strings are no longer here.
1528.54 1538.06 speaker1  We got suit of armor.
1537.06 1549.26 speaker0  pockets though. Might as well run a hand through. It was a statue.
1548.26 1555.18 speaker1  That's gaudy. Oh yeah. All this shit is horrible. He's got the rose paint.
1554.18 1559.74 speaker2  Wait, hold on.
1556.46 1572.42 speaker1  Bow tie that moved, Rose painting.
1571.42 1582.24 speaker0  tie in the package? It was indeed.
1578.82 1604.22 speaker1  We found James dead with Maggie cook. She got a gift box with those things in it. We are at James's house with two dead bodies and a 12 foot pit.
1602.98 1613.54 speaker0  at the mill and him working at the mill. I wonder if they knew each other before all this.
1612.22 1625.14 speaker1  So I mean, what do you think? I mean, that is the mysterious present that I took credit for, which you know was a lie, right? You know, by this time. My eyes narrow.
1624.14 1633.14 speaker2  It's like a key.
1632.14 1644.02 speaker1  benefit me. Okay, so how?
1642.18 1657.90 speaker0  Why would he have sent this stuff? I think we need to go to the mill. I think the mill's a really good place to go. One, two, three. Mighty Ducks.
1656.90 1660.90 speaker1  Mighty Ducks.
1659.90 1667.50 speaker2  It's quack. That's super not what they did in that movie, guys.
1664.90 1673.10 speaker0  Mighty Ducks on three.
1672.10 1679.14 speaker2  crime scene? What are you doing?
1678.14 1691.06 speaker1  about a... Yeah, I bet a few people do though.
1687.54 1698.26 speaker0  We should get that handbag from those paramedics, run some tests on that bad boy.
1697.26 1699.26 speaker1  What's your name, buddy?
1698.26 1708.42 speaker2  I'm the EMT. Yeah, absolutely.
1707.42 1732.18 speaker0  I'm Emmett, the EMT. We've got a couple bodies at the bottom of a pit that we can't get out of. Could you send some guys with ropes to pull those up for us and get them over to the corner? You make sure nobody else gets in here.
1731.18 1737.34 speaker1  Yeah, hey, Emmett.
1734.22 1745.54 speaker2  Listen, we're deputizing you. Too late, buddy.
1743.54 1795.66 speaker1  Let's just get Florence over here to... Who? Florence? Florence. Let's get Flo over here to patrol until we tell her not to. Sounds good. Drew, tell them to relay the info to Florence. Sounds good. Yeah, it's not gonna happen. I got some cousins.
1794.66 1803.90 speaker2  It's like, we get it. You're pretty now.
1802.06 1820.34 speaker0  even over the doors and the windows and stuff.
1819.34 1900.86 speaker1  here. I don't know how we could do that. Somebody could leave their cell phone. Oh, no. Do it. I go to my cruiser, and I'm hoping that my other two officers aren't looking at me. And I open up the trunk, and I look around, and I open up. in there. I just have a bunch of snacks. Is that in the foyer? Those are both in the foyer. Kind of above and to the right of both of those, I put it up in the corner, and I tape it up there, and I have it feeding to my phone. Sweet. Done. And I'm kind of sad, because I was going to do some cool ... I've been trying to learn how to skateboard, so I've been putting it on my helmet while I skateboard, but none
1898.86 1916.46 speaker2  I'm going to say, hey, buddy. I was thinking about you. Hey, man. The door flings open, and steam starts just pouring out of this room. Oh, you're enjoying this now.
1913.74 1936.82 speaker1  Well, I guess it's good that I caught you in a good mood, because hey, it does seem to me like the estate has a real fixer-upper on their hands, and I'd be willing to take this off your hands pretty cheap. Glad you got the shit taken care of. Here's some pants. Hey, buddy. I need you to do me a big favor. So you could shit them again easily? Okay, you know what?
1935.82 1955.34 speaker2  That all adds up. So, hey.
1954.34 1958.34 speaker1  us know immediately.
1957.34 1965.78 speaker2  Okay.
1964.42 1986.10 speaker1  Yeah, that means soon.
1983.70 2018.82 speaker2  area, standing- Yeah, man, we kicked a robot's ass.
2017.82 2034.32 speaker1  Yeah.
2027.06 2070.34 speaker2  a bunch of ammo for the weapon he was using earlier, and that's it. That's all that's in the pants. John unbuttons those pants, unzips those pants, and starts bringing those trousers to the ground, and there is, hanging between the mechanical legs of this thing, it's a real penis. Look at that, boys.
2067.10 2090.94 speaker1  I thought it was going to be, like, John Peter's face stares back at you. Yeah, right.
2083.58 2112.30 speaker2  Okay, so when you take his pants down to the ground, he is smooth like a Ken doll. However, on the penis spot, the spot where a penis and balls would be, there is a little symbol etched into the metal, and it is an M, the letter M, as in Mancy, made of four
2109.86 2121.06 speaker1  double helices.
2120.06 2127.42 speaker2  Full luck. No dice.
2125.06 2134.58 speaker0  If I look at it, do I- does it ring any bells for Clark? Nope.
2132.78 2136.58 speaker2  That sounds like a flow job.
2135.58 2137.58 speaker1  Flow job.
2136.58 2140.42 speaker2  I think we won't-
2138.58 2195.78 speaker1  Well, we haven't gotten in contact with Flow. I contacted Drew to get in contact with Flow. I want Flow to stay here. I think we should have Drew come down here, take the legs back to evidence. But then they're just sitting in a room. It's not like Drew can do anything with them there. Yeah, but we can do with them at some point. I'm with you. If they stay here, then they're just going to go by the wayside. Yeah, we can just take them. Ooh, let's take the robot legs. Yeah, but I feel like if we take the robot legs with us, they're going to attack us at some point. Then we can get them at a jump point. say aye. Aye. Aye. All in favor of taking them with us to the mill. Aye. Aye. Okay, so I- I-
2194.78 2196.78 speaker0  That way they can't get to them.
2195.78 2220.22 speaker1  We'll take real good care of them, buddy. Yeah, we'll throw them in the trunk of my cruiser. Great, guys. Okay, well- What, are you afraid they'll ruin your snacks? You don't know that I have snacks in there. We know about your snacks, buddy. I sit down on the ground, I'm like, you guys can do whatever you want to do. He's mad.
2219.22 2232.10 speaker0  Keith is angry.
2230.70 2265.44 speaker1  He's got the best drive. Me. 70. wait for the other two officers. Right before they get- Oh, yeah. Right before they get to my car- I don't think I can carry it. Taking one arm. One arm.
2262.50 2274.48 speaker0  Yeah, I get to the ankles underneath the armpit there.
2270.92 2329.24 speaker1  I lock the trunk right before they try to open it. I hear the gun shoot off, I'm like, ah, I don't want to test it, so I unlock it and then- Oh, I put the legs in the trunk. I'm laughing, but it hurts. The first time I do it, it hurts my ribs to laugh, so I just unlock it because I'm like, I can't keep doing this. It'll be too funny. So it's unlocked. I open it. And then I lock it right before. At this point, I'm just like hurting and tired and mad. Stream it out.
