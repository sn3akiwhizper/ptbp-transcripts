0.00 193.20 speaker0  You are tuned in to 694.2 PTPP here in the idyllic town of Contention. It's your oral doula, Wolf the Dog, here to guide you through this warmer than usual December 4th. We are supported today by a dear friend who is making a deliciously positive impact in some place called Springfield, Missouri. Jake's Vegan Burgers. You can find Jake's Burgers and Taco Meat at Mama Jean's, Jake's Patty Melt and Quinoa Sausage Bowl at Druff's, Jake's Breakfast Sausage at Gailey's and Jake's Italian Sausage at Piccolo in Nixa. Whether you are vegan, vegetarian or just plain hungry, follow him at Jake's Underscore Vegan Underscore Burgers on Instagram. Y'all been on that Instagram before, seen a whole lot of pictures of dogs on there, saw some people taking pictures of sandwiches and whatnot. They were chased by a couple of giant, gaunt, suited men that seemed to vanish when the pair of Bettymores came across John's nemesis, Large Eddie. Now Large Eddie was roughing up Don's car in the parking lot and Don wasn't taken too kindly to it. The altercation ended with a deliriously concussed John Lee Bettymore seeing his second cousin father figure scorch Large Eddie's fist with only his hand. Back in the current timeline, the officers went to the First Church of Condention, which was hosting a lunch for anyone who needed it. The lunch was made by the pastor's wife and children and served by the youth group. and learned that he is working on legislation to allow motorcyclists to ride without helmets.
191.60 206.60 speaker1  I think they're just called D-Pants. D-Pants? Something like that. What do you have, though? E-Pants. They're one better. Yep. Exactly.
206.00 298.60 speaker2  True. And this week we have a special guest. We have our friend Jake sitting in. Hi. He's playing Ferguson Beans, the brother of the child Keith Beans. And we're going to do a flashback to the childhood of a young seven-year-old Keith Beans and a nine-year-old Ferguson Beans. So let's hop right into it. The home of William and Lena Beans was a beautiful estate that sat just outside of contention. The grounds were sprawling and filled with well-kept gardens and ponds and bridges and statues. There were multiple buildings on the land. The Beans' home was the largest and most grand. And there was also a small office building where William spent most of his days and nights working on his projects. This was one of those days. William was off in his shop and Lena was in her room on the phone. Keith and Ferguson are having breakfast in a massive pristine kitchen. The sunlight shining in through the windows on a beautiful day. And what do these young boys look like? Keith, if you want to kick it off. I look a lot like Keith Vigna just 22 years younger.
295.60 305.60 speaker1  Yeah, I've pretty much had big pants my whole life. A young boy? A young boy, Keith.
305.00 321.60 speaker2  Young Keith. Pre-Vigna Keith. Picture of Keith.
319.60 337.60 speaker1  Ferguson is beautiful. Right.
334.60 350.60 speaker2  This country has a problem with sexualizing young alien boys. Right.
348.60 366.60 speaker1  And you know, already very tall. Too skinny. Like a very skinny kid. Awesome.
361.60 396.60 speaker2  But we see her hand a plate of eggs Benedict to both children at the same time. She's just asking what you're going to do with your day. Helga. There's something weird in my voice.
394.60 399.60 speaker1  It's good to see you and thank you for breakfast.
396.60 404.60 speaker2  It'll fuel us for our games today.
400.60 409.60 speaker1  Eggs Benedict are a particularly difficult dish to make.
407.60 413.60 speaker2  Did I get the Hollandaise sauce right?
410.60 436.60 speaker1  Oh, that's so sweet of you to say. He only has like one pair of clothes.
434.60 447.60 speaker2  Ferguson's got these like beautiful threads.
440.60 486.60 speaker1  And a lot of like sometimes he just likes to wear the frilled like ruffled collars, like which is not period appropriate. It may look a little big on you, but you're welcome to. Thank you. Yeah. He's very, you know, vain. So, you know, Ferguson probably was a little confused by your selection of a sports clothes for a play time, but he pardons the insanity.
484.60 494.60 speaker2  That's awfully kind of you. Uh, so what is Ferguson wearing to play? Probably some linens.
493.60 514.60 speaker1  Yeah. Uh, because if they ever get stains on them, they're immediately discarded. Amazing. Okay.
508.60 532.60 speaker2  Ahead of you is a massive fountain and the circle drive that comes right in front of the home. And you can see the different buildings on the land that your father owns. And what do you guys, uh, what do you guys want to do? Where do you guys want to run off to? The sun is shining high. It's what a game day for play day.
531.60 561.60 speaker1  it. it's so engrossed. brother, probably shoots him a look. I snicker and I head back to the fountain to do it again. Keith, please.
560.60 564.60 speaker2  What do you want to do then? You're boring.
563.60 581.60 speaker1  I'm just deep in thought. Look, that one has a wiener. Yes, wieners are funny.
580.60 605.60 speaker2  boobs. there's just like an old, old woman who's a servant for your father who's just staring at you, shaking your head as she walks away. What do you want to do? These statues are boring.
603.60 619.60 speaker1  Perhaps we should continue that. Can I be the robber this time? I knew you were going to say that.
614.60 642.60 speaker2  black bandit cloth wrapped around his eyes, like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with the little eye holes cut out and he's wearing a all black and white striped shirt with black pants and he's holding two bags that just have big dollar signs on them.
636.60 653.60 speaker1  bobby cap and gives it a little flick and it goes from being folded up into a thing and places it on his head.
648.60 668.60 speaker2  head in full officer regalia. He's got a look in his eyes that says the law's coming all over you. Coming for a naughty boy.
664.60 701.60 speaker1  it down on the ground in front of him to, you know, make him lose his balance when he runs after me. And I throw another handful and I run away. Ferguson is annoyed that his brother's stolen his coin collection and use them as a weapon against him, but he's patient and begins to collect the coins.
700.60 721.60 speaker2  this building. It's got Ivy crawling all up along the sides and you know this to be your father's workshop where you guys aren't supposed to hang out by, but Keith is running and trying to hide around the backside because I think maybe he knows that you won't go there.
720.60 752.60 speaker1  Oh, okay. I think that probably, I mean, how far away? What's the distance between us? Between you and Keith? 20 yards. Okay. thing. Keith, get out of there.
750.60 772.60 speaker2  I'm the gingerbread man.
769.60 776.60 speaker1  I don't understand what you're talking about, policeman.
772.60 906.60 speaker2  As you guys are having this conversation, you hear something that you've only heard maybe once before in your lives, and it was when you were much, much younger, but you hear these alarms going off all over the entire estate, and it's just like this, wow, wow, about, you actually see security is like breaking out into different formations all over the property. You probably see two or three guys coming in your direction, in your general direction, they look like, but they are almost landing. You think that it looks like they're landing on the ground near you, however, you didn't actually see them in the air, and these things are massive, gaunt humanoids in these black suits with translucent skin, and as you're being picked up by security and running away, these things are being put down by the security guards. The guns are firing all around you, the alarms are still going off, and your father is nowhere to be seen, but security is all over the entire place as you guys are tucked back into the home where it is safe, and later that night, your dad comes in, William Beans, and he sits and the alarms that we have on the estate. Ferguson, you know that my top priority is to keep you safe, and I will do everything that I can in order to make sure that you stay safe. Thank you. Thank you. I want you to come with me, and he stands up, and he reaches out his hand toward you.
903.60 919.60 speaker1  face reaches out to take his father's hand.
912.60 922.60 speaker2  really around, so you can either go back into your room, or you can follow them and kind of like hide.
921.60 931.60 speaker1  Yeah, they're leaving the house.
926.60 944.60 speaker2  They're walking toward the office with the ivy climbing the walls where William works, that you've never been in before, and neither is Ferguson, to your knowledge.
942.60 950.60 speaker1  try to hide and follow and see what happens. Okay.
945.60 967.60 speaker2  So as you make your way there, you would eventually come to a spot in the wood on the property, maybe behind a well-sculpted bush or a nice tree. With good pubic hair?
965.60 982.60 speaker1  I think that, yeah, it was like a bait and switch. Okay, that's fair.
976.60 1041.60 speaker2  William comes out of the door of the office and he takes a knee and looks at you, Ferguson, and he's holding something. It's a watch. Ferguson, I don't know how much longer I'll be around, and I had hoped that I would be You are the anointed. When the time is right, you must go back and save the world. And he puts this watch around your wrist, and it's way too big for you. Yeah, probably pretty heavy too. And it doesn't have anything on the face of it. And, Keith, when you see it go around Ferguson's wrist, something on his face changes, and he looks kind of different. And then William says to Ferguson, it will fit when the time is right. Is that because it's a watch?
1040.60 1064.60 speaker1  The time?
1062.60 1070.60 speaker0  It was awful, but it was so good.
1069.60 1074.60 speaker1  with it in tow?
1073.60 1083.60 speaker2  Should we go lock it up?
1081.60 1114.60 speaker1  Let's put them all in the same spot. Maybe not all in the same spot. I thought you were just like Wheel of Fortune. Power Rangers is on Saturday mornings when I wake up. Only if you turn the TV on. Yeah. Let's put them each in their own separate locker. Okay. Lock them up.
1112.60 1136.60 speaker3  Put them something a little, yeah, or maybe more secure. I don't know. It's a locker at a police department. I mean, our evidence room probably has... Individual. Individual. Yeah.
1130.60 1142.60 speaker2  and the helmet all in four separate lockers within the evidence room of the police station.
1140.60 1155.60 speaker3  or lights changing? You don't. Okay.
1154.60 1165.60 speaker1  A real ozone-y smell. Yeah.
1164.60 1174.60 speaker3  ball that we found?
1173.60 1189.60 speaker2  Yeah. Is there anything else that you guys have acquired throughout the campaign so far that you would like to put in these lockers, or is it just these four main items? Just the four main items. I think just those four, yeah.
1188.60 1199.60 speaker3  Yeah, because that could be useful. You think?
1198.60 1200.60 speaker1  Yeah, you got the bag.
1199.60 1203.60 speaker3  Clark's got the bag.
1200.60 1219.60 speaker2  Clark's got the bag. When you were looking at all four of the items that you put into the lockers at the police station, you would notice that they all have the red light showing, except for the camera, which has the green light showing. Okay. Duly noted.
1218.60 1240.48 speaker3  Oh, shit. I'd like to mess with it just a little bit. Okay. orders in relation to each other and just see if that changes the lights at all. Okay. That takes some time.
1236.60 1261.60 speaker2  I mean, one of the objects is a pretty heavy radio, so maybe you move the items around it or you move all of them, whatever, either way. It takes some time, but you would notice that the lights don't change. The camera is green.
1260.20 1277.28 speaker1  It was back at Splashylvania. Yeah, and it had a picture of the guy in the... In the stocks. In the stocks. I think we should take a picture. I think we should, too. ordinary?
1275.68 1301.76 speaker3  Do I see a spooky thing through the... Okay. You never have. Take a picture. I'm pretty nervous, but let's go take a picture outside. gun and you took a picture of me like that? That'd be cool, huh? No way. No. No. No. Okay. Well...
1300.76 1309.40 speaker1  I can put it on my... I got an Instagram recently. I can put it on there.
1307.96 1335.48 speaker3  and then we'll go from there. Has the light been on this whole time?
1333.00 1351.96 speaker2  It was last used the night of December 2nd.
1350.96 1364.08 speaker3  I'm outside. I'm doing two thumbs up.
1363.08 1386.60 speaker1  You guys should follow me. I'm Keith0911 on Instagram, and then I make sure the safety's on and it's not, so I turn
1379.92 1407.44 speaker2  come back into focus, you see a piece of paper being smoothly printed out of the bottom of this camera. Everyone roll Sanity. Let's start with John and go around.
1405.44 1415.52 speaker3  I didn't leave a D4 out. That's four. Four, yeah. You might want to use a different one, but yeah. Three.
1414.52 1425.08 speaker1  Three.
1420.52 1432.04 speaker2  John Lee Pettymore loses four Sanity, Keith Vigno loses three Sanity, and Clark Bishop loses four Sanity.
1429.52 1451.88 speaker1  I'm at 30, my breaking point is 30. I'm at 36, and my breaking point is 32.
1450.32 1473.56 speaker3  Instagram account.
1468.86 1540.24 speaker2  You can barely make out the two figures in the picture, thanks to the light from a small candle, also made out of a substance without color. The candle is sitting on a table made of the same unbelievably black texture, and of the two men, one is a slender, muscular man in a black t-shirt, revealing tribal tattoo sleeves on both arms going down to his hands and fingertips. He is kneeling before another man who looks like a no-bullshit John Wayne-style cowboy. This man seems to be aware of the picture being taken, holding his hand up to block his face from the camera's flash and sight. On John Lee Pettymore's hands, you see that inky black substance, and it's dripping onto the ground from the camera and the picture. It's pooling on the ground, and you can swear it's moving, but when you blink, the substance is gone. John's hands are clean, and he's holding this odd device, and this even odder picture.
1535.28 1546.88 speaker3  John still feels like there's goo on his- he is freaking out a little bit.
1541.28 1551.64 speaker2  Also, if I could get an alertness roll from both Keith and Clark. I fail.
1550.64 1556.96 speaker3  43 out of 70.
1555.80 1605.58 speaker2  the recording going. If you guys just want to dip out on the other side of the door, and la la la. Okay, so Clark, when you saw that inky black liquid dripping all over the camera and picture in John's hands, you looked up, and saw that exact same substance oozing out of John Lee Pettymore's eyes, his nose, his mouth, and his ears. As soon as you blink, the substance is gone. Okay, so would you guys like to do anything, or would you like to just get the camera-
1604.58 1613.58 speaker1  I don't, do I? Tribal Tats and Contingent would like stick out, right? Is this John Wayne?
1611.58 1646.30 speaker3  That guy looks like John Wayne. Is that guy John- no, but he does. He looks like an actual cowboy. That's kind of silly. Yeah, everyone in Contingent is a cowboy. We're all cowboys.
1645.30 1651.82 speaker2  No.
1649.04 1654.02 speaker3  It's like he knew you were taking a picture, though.
1651.82 1661.36 speaker1  He's got his hand right in front of the flash.
1659.98 1678.26 speaker3  something came through. This is some kind of gateway.
1676.98 1689.48 speaker1  stocks.
1688.48 1706.60 speaker3  with the camera. In the stocks? In the stocks.
1705.60 1714.28 speaker1  Oh, that's right.
1713.28 1719.56 speaker3  This is Joe real fast. Did we, we still don't know anything about where he is, right? John Peters? I don't think so.
1718.56 1731.56 speaker1  We haven't answered any questions. Oh, shit. Um, so Billy Harrison, who was part of the team, as far as we understand, they were just
1730.56 1739.88 speaker3  Uh, sorta. I think didn't the, I think the FBI agents mentioned John, John Peters to me. Right. You're right.
1738.88 1748.70 speaker1  You're right. You're right.
1747.56 1759.48 speaker3  Maybe John was a part of that. They were working together. Maybe John brought all this stuff here. Maybe got out of here.
1758.48 1763.92 speaker1  MMA fights or something.
1762.92 1776.68 speaker3  It seemed like. He had a whole list of funny fighter names.
1775.68 1786.48 speaker2  Ah-woo. Yeah.
1785.48 1792.60 speaker1  Squaring off against. How about that? Instead of versus-ing.
1791.60 1796.92 speaker2  Planet juggernaut.
1795.92 1803.90 speaker3  Yeah. Juggernaut.
1801.04 1829.38 speaker2  Just about things that you've already seen. The Fonzie woman at the hotel motel said that Marvin sent them to contention to find out what happened to Jermaine Glass and Alfred Glass when they came to collect money from John Peters. Okay. He won't shut up about some gun. He sounded like a lunatic and Jermaine is missing.
1825.98 1837.44 speaker1  The Glass dudes are associated with the mobster guy. John Peters probably bet on these fights and lost and they are like sharks coming to get money from them.
1836.44 1842.74 speaker3  Well, yeah.
1839.44 1850.74 speaker1  That's just- I think that's what he just said. Yeah. You know what?
1849.74 1853.74 speaker3  Give him the light bulb. Dude. Oh yeah.
1852.74 1857.46 speaker1  That's a good gangster thing.
1855.50 1861.86 speaker3  Will you describe the picture as we hold it now?
1860.86 1879.78 speaker1  Yeah.
1878.18 1885.02 speaker3  The room is made of nothingness.
1883.94 1890.98 speaker2  There are two men.
1887.02 1906.38 speaker3  It's also- Tribal guy is standing- The tribal guy's kneeling before another man. I'm sorry. Okay. So he's kneeling, the John Wayne guy is standing. Yes. Yes.
1905.02 1923.06 speaker1  we should head off to the mill. Hey, also, I don't want to do this, but just to make the thing better, I did cocaine and you said it would only last for a few hours, so.
1920.68 1931.66 speaker2  So you feel like hot, sweet garbage. Also, it is 1 p.m. now.
1929.54 1940.26 speaker1  I'll be right back. Okay. Thanks for telling us. I go to the bathroom and I rip a line of cocaine. Go ahead and roll a D6 for me.
1939.26 1947.14 speaker2  It's a four. You're good until 5 p.m. Cool. You are coked up to the gills. Hell yeah, baby.
1946.14 1950.82 speaker1  You are coked.
1947.14 1969.10 speaker2  You did a fat line in the bathroom of the police station.
1968.10 1980.38 speaker3  passing. Yeah, you didn't flush.
1975.46 2012.50 speaker1  I've got my phone out up to my ear and it's playing Life's Been Good by Joe Walsh and I'm like banging my head to the guitar riff. I just kind of want to like jam. I'll ride with Clark then. Sorry, Clark. It's going to be a really good time. I just don't feel like driving right now. I think it would be safer if the two of us were right up there together, you know? Okay, yeah, yeah.
2011.02 2020.66 speaker3  I'm already walking out the door.
2016.26 2035.38 speaker2  Okay, so you guys begin driving off to the mill.
2032.42 2049.06 speaker3  Our DM is literally vomiting with excitement. He's looking like Ramona right now.
2041.58 2088.74 speaker2  About halfway in between downtown and the highway, you go over a overpass that leads over the creek. It's actually, you would know, it's the same creek that runs behind the first church of contention. In fact, as you take the main drag, looking to your right on the other side of the creek, you can see the back of the first church of contention. juncture as well. This is a different place?
2082.06 2113.10 speaker3  having a cat mind, or a person mind in a cat body, we'll find her cat husband because he'll be the only goddamn cat that's not in that creek. Good job. Is he letting Vigna use your radio? He's definitely doing coke, right? He says yes he is. Over. Yeah, I heard.
2112.10 2151.88 speaker1  I did it. Why are you doing coke? Why my hand? Because I don't feel very good without it. I don't, you know. Are you hearing voices, Keith? The more you talk about it, the more nervous I'm going to get. Let's just roll with it. Just act like I'm normal. I am normal. I would not be able to function. I'll tell you that. Alright. That's why I went to...
2150.52 2161.60 speaker3  Keith, we're going to talk about your dependency later. I'm not dependent. I'm just, it's useful for me right now.
2160.60 2170.36 speaker1  Let's just go. Why are you guys talking about... Just make sure it's that way.
2169.36 2184.80 speaker3  What is it then?
2181.48 2193.20 speaker1  I crawl over the console into the backseat. Well, no, it's a cop car.
2189.80 2199.80 speaker3  You just bang your forehead on the cage.
2198.80 2374.84 speaker2  Keith! John or Clark, who is ahead? Who is behind? You see the sky ahead of you begin to swirl. About thirty feet above the ground, a flat oval begins to form. The sky around it spirals like cloth, making folds as it gathers in bunches in certain places in the sky. The oval is black, but a technicolor energy is erupting from its darkness, and then the sky is just as it was, but something is falling. Roll sand. Fail. I'm broke, y'all. We're going crazy together, brother. glass immediately cover everything around you. Slumped across your dashboard is the lifeless body of a grown man, and blood is splattered everywhere. Roll sanity. Now real quick, Clark, I need you to roll a drive check. windshield. You instantly feel another violent impact, this time from behind, as Clark plows into your cruiser. You lose control of the vehicle and swerve into oncoming traffic. You hear the sound of a horn blaring, and you vaguely remember the sight of a minivan driving in the oncoming lane before this chaos of disorienting glass and blood and pain. You see a flash of color fly by out of the corner of your eye and then, as your car finally jerks to a stop, you hear a deafening crash, and the rumble of fire. How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the
