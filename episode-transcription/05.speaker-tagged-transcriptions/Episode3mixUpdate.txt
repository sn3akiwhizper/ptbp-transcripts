0.00 96.44 speaker0  Good morning my babies, it's everybody's favorite radio DJing contention wolf the dog and we are hitting you live from 694.2 PTBP today with a little news for y'all. Councilwoman Carrie Page's dog is missing and let me tell y'all she is pissed about can't catch a break. And two people came to John Peters house packed a drunken to their white Toyota and took off coming in hot off the presses we got a new song for y'all it's No Backbone by Kudzu.
95.44 127.44 speaker1  That was funny. of his body sticking straight up and it looked like his dick was like a uh. What happened last time Zach? Last time you guys were standing at John Peters house and uh you just reviewed Keith Vigna's excellent policing. Yeah you're welcome for that.
126.44 130.48 speaker2  Yeah yeah yeah.
127.44 152.40 speaker1  Because I didn't do any I didn't have a climax. John Peters drives a maroon car.
151.40 157.24 speaker2  Civic.
152.40 175.84 speaker1  And the car that came picked up the trunk and also drove off with John Peters car were two men in a white Toyota. Fucking exotic dude. Do not open if you want to live. Correct?
171.64 179.72 speaker2  Or conversely it said open if you want to die. That was just implied.
177.28 193.12 speaker1  It's about 2pm on December 2nd. But um chuh dude. Happy New Year.
187.28 198.04 speaker2  I repeatedly told you that I loved you a lot and it still rings true today. We'll see about tomorrow but. I wish you'd been there.
197.04 200.04 speaker1  I was sleepy. Hahaha.
199.04 211.40 speaker2  Dude wait here.
208.84 212.40 speaker1  Joe just like moved his lip a little bit and was doing it.
211.40 215.44 speaker2  Pretty much there. It's kind of my face.
213.72 223.80 speaker1  He had that dry vape mouth.
219.64 231.68 speaker2  The best way to do it is like to not have to move your muscles in your lip and just have it hang on there because of how dry it is.
230.68 236.04 speaker1  That the men came in. Not for sure.
233.68 257.22 speaker2  I don't think we can put out an APB for a white Toyota. Yeah also we didn't. Cause she drives a white car right? And they were in a white Toyota. Wait hold on. Is this a cool like knocking on the door sound? Hold on.
256.22 259.22 speaker1  Yeah it is.
258.22 271.78 speaker2  Set the scene.
265.02 282.02 speaker1  Mildred Mitchell is headed back across the street to her home which has her white car in the driveway. There's a black car in her driveway as well since we're just talking colors of cars. I drive a silver car.
280.26 293.28 speaker2  That's a police work that I do.
292.28 296.02 speaker1  What color is your car?
294.28 344.00 speaker2  Are we in the house or out of the house right now? I think you are standing in the house of John. Can I roll a search roll just to do. I think you already crit succeeded right? bad about how shitty I did this first that first time around where. You're like seeing their faces. I really want to redeem myself on this like shoddy police work that I've done and I want
336.84 347.80 speaker1  that you saw earlier are cleaned up, the bedding stubs are still there, bottles are still around.
344.00 357.84 speaker2  The people who were clearly here did not drop anything. I want to look at the pictures real fast are they anything interesting?
352.12 373.32 speaker1  Yeah basically it's just pictures of him and like maybe some friends from college. But they were broken before and now they're all cleaned up? They would probably want to move them in order to have a clear path.
370.64 386.00 speaker2  So obviously he did not come back to the house. So we got to figure out who was in that white Toyota.
380.28 403.88 speaker1  You guys would also be dealing with the fact that there was a dead body out in the junkyard last night? That's true. Frankly all that seems secondary to the city councilor stuff.
401.80 428.10 speaker2  Like how would we wrap this up as far as a case goes? I don't know I feel like if there's three of us on the force and a murder just happened this is not gonna be in our mind.
423.86 439.82 speaker1  The hardest lead we have right now towards the big mystery is the dogs.
438.50 452.30 speaker2  You wanna go hit up that chief? We all drive all three of our cop cars back to the station.
448.30 456.98 speaker1  No we're just bad.
454.62 463.42 speaker2  You just gotta focus our energy on...
462.42 476.26 speaker1  I got 50. 75? 55. Yes. You do have the dead body and you basically have one lead from that.
474.10 552.16 speaker2  Have we heard back from the coroner on... Yes. Would I know this? The brand that she had on her back was that in like the same size or font that the do What? She was... He says confidently. I'm a good detective. I am. So the do not open if you want to live was branded into the trunk and that lady had that brand in her back.
551.16 557.42 speaker1  I closed. It seems like Keith did his due diligence so.
555.82 567.26 speaker2  We closed the door this time. And then just bailed. And we leave. Alright cool.
562.32 572.42 speaker1  You let Drew know that you want to get a hold of county and get a picture of the back of the body that was found out in the junkyard.
568.66 573.42 speaker2  Honestly I'd like to have all the pictures that the coroner took just for posterity.
572.42 594.34 speaker1  Sure. Perfect absolutely. I didn't recognize any of it. It seemed like it might be symbolic of some sort of stratification in the city or perhaps amongst the cult.
591.78 599.98 speaker2  Didn't know that it would make her react that way so.
598.62 606.22 speaker0  I called the chief. It goes straight to voicemail.
605.22 609.38 speaker2  This has never happened. Not even remotely?
608.22 615.90 speaker1  Okay so I'm a little maybe worried.
614.14 620.78 speaker0  She's never missed a day of work like this before.
619.78 627.50 speaker2  Yeah sure. I just want to apologize when we see her.
625.22 632.50 speaker1  Which ones do you want to use to describe your actions? Tag. Are you going to come with? Yeah.
631.50 634.50 speaker2  Might as well.
633.50 646.02 speaker1  We do that. Okay you guys head over to the chiefs house. The chief lives in the old neighborhood right by beans pond. She has. A nice old house. Is that the northwest?
644.02 662.72 speaker2  No this is just southwest of downtown.
659.62 665.08 speaker1  east of pages Kerry pages.
662.72 668.08 speaker0  So they're all like within blocks of each other? Oh yeah. Cool.
667.08 717.64 speaker1  Yep yep yep yep yep. So you go to the chiefs house and her cruiser is not out front. Like a F-150. Can I do a search roll for the chief? Hey guys. Guys I've really tried my best here. You would know. I think you've known her for a long time. Her truck is in the garage typically. There is probably just like one window up front that you can see through the curtains a little bit and you can't see it.
716.64 727.12 speaker2  It's nice. Thank you for that.
722.76 732.12 speaker1  It's got a nice little front patio area with a bench on it. Nice. Nice.
731.12 737.12 speaker2  Rick? Uh yeah.
734.12 743.56 speaker1  What did it, what was my looking in the windows? What did that? See it's dark in there.
742.56 754.64 speaker2  It's not. It's locked. I'm going to swing around back guys and see if the back door is open because I feel so bad about making her storm off and I just, I need to apologize and this seems a little fishy.
753.64 778.80 speaker1  I don't know. She's got a gate on her privacy fence that doesn't have a lock on it so you just go into her backyard and as you're walking through her backyard you can see in her back windows and the lights are off. Nobody's home. I'm going to check the back door. Absolutely. Yeah. Hold on just a second. I'm going to do a roll for her real quick. No, no, no. Everything's locked up nice and tight.
777.80 815.90 speaker2  Everything's locked up. Okay. Well I swing back around front and uh. Let's go check and just see if, was it Harry Klinker? Who's the guy that runs that place? You know Harry. I don't know Harry. I don't know anybody in this town. It's a few boys. Let's go to Klinker's and check out and see if anybody saw her. If not, you know, I think between the three of us we can handle this murder mystery. We don't need the chief, but I'd love to apologize to her.
813.70 855.56 speaker1  So yeah, we head over to Klinker's. Okay, you walk into Klinker's. Klinker's is like a small shitty dive bar. When you walk in, there's cigarette smoke hanging in the air. There's three tables. There's a pool table and a bar. There's a couple of regulars in there and Harry, the owner and bartender is back behind the bar. What did Harry do to you? Dick? I bet, like honestly, I bet Harry would be pretty anxious to see all three cops in town
854.56 863.28 speaker2  Can we establish this? Do you know this guy? Probably. Yeah. I think we all do. I don't. I'm playing the new kid in town.
862.28 872.24 speaker1  I know, but you've been here for a few months.
869.16 875.76 speaker2  Harry Klinker babysat every child. Yeah. He was my babysitter.
874.24 893.64 speaker1  Did your mama never drop you off at Klinker's? There's a baby seat. You see, there's a doorway in the back right of the bar and it's got one of those baby gates on it and there are three toddlers standing over the edge trying to crawl over.
892.64 904.98 speaker0  Well, hey, question. Have you seen the chief? Thanks. And we head out. Bye, Harry. Bye, Harry.
903.64 915.04 speaker1  That was Harry.
911.56 923.64 speaker3  I pull out my pack of cigarettes that you guys have never seen me smoke.
918.76 931.80 speaker2  I go, I just had some weird thoughts from my childhood come in. I spent more time at Klinker's when I was a kid than I have since I've lived here.
930.80 956.30 speaker3  Oh, hey. You came outside, Harry? Yeah. He steps outside for a smoke.
954.18 963.22 speaker1  Well, that doesn't really answer the question.
961.22 969.50 speaker3  So in your experience, no.
966.06 973.30 speaker0  He would only eat hot dogs cut up on white bread.
972.30 976.08 speaker3  Great question.
974.30 979.90 speaker2  What's, what's the hottest lead we got?
978.90 987.82 speaker0  Got nothing back. Yeah. Took the body to the corner. I guess we could run.
986.38 1014.38 speaker1  Drew will send them on over. Okay. Yeah. You're going to lose one sanity as you see this brutal act shown out on this, uh, this woman's back. The skin is blistered and boiled around each letter.
1013.38 1021.30 speaker0  we did? Would they have done anything like that?
1020.30 1022.30 speaker1  check some stuff.
1021.30 1030.22 speaker0  They're not sure what's going on. Okay. And then also the Julie gal who crashed her car. Yeah.
1029.26 1040.38 speaker1  Yeah. They called and said that she was pronounced dead last night.
1039.38 1049.62 speaker2  Some kind of inquest. Cause this is a, this is my main person of interest.
1048.62 1051.62 speaker0  Let's look into that. Let's see if she's, let's run her name.
1050.62 1058.74 speaker2  See if she's on casenet.
1057.38 1060.74 speaker0  you get any background on her. Okay.
1059.74 1078.58 speaker1  Sounds good. You are going to find that she has an Etsy page for her taxidermy. She's a taxidermist. What's her last name, Julie Maxwell. Maybe like a few, uh, disorderly conduct charges from a couple of years ago. Here in town. Here in town.
1077.58 1092.26 speaker2  Was it alcohol related?
1088.78 1097.74 speaker0  So she got it awarded to her against Leo or Leo put it out on her.
1096.74 1105.24 speaker2  Yeah.
1103.18 1108.82 speaker3  I hope they're still there.
1107.82 1113.82 speaker2  And we talked to Leo. Right. I think we talked to Leo. Yep.
1112.82 1118.82 speaker3  Well let's take off toot sweet to the piston boys.
1116.10 1119.82 speaker2  That can be the auspices in which we visit them.
1118.82 1120.82 speaker3  Yeah.
1119.82 1144.86 speaker1  Okay. And just to stay on the same thread, you guys wanted to talk to the hospital about Julie Maxwell's body. So you have Drew send over a message to them saying that you want a full report on the autopsy of Julie Maxwell's body. Okay. And then the three of you head out to the piston farm. It's kind of by the junkyard in the far Southeast corner. So they like live right next to it.
1143.86 1159.38 speaker2  Gotcha.
1158.38 1173.78 speaker1  Okay. So the three of you drive out to the piston farm. It's a pig farm. And when you arrive, it's on the old country road and there is a gate that is locked at the insurance farm gate. Yeah.
1172.78 1174.82 speaker2  You got his number, right?
1173.82 1193.30 speaker1  Hey Leo. You can see the farm and it is probably 150 yards off the road.
1192.30 1217.86 speaker3  Hey buddy. We're we're outside. We need to, uh, yeah, this is, uh, this is John Lee Pettymore, the fourth of a deputy. You know me, Leo. Just four, one we rarely see. Can you let us in buddy? Your very ominous pig farm.
1216.30 1218.86 speaker2  We told him that we would do this.
1217.86 1233.44 speaker3  Yeah. Hey Leo, that's why we're here. We're bringing you your key back.
1229.32 1255.32 speaker1  down the road and goes up to the other side of the gate and he gets out of the truck and walks up, kind of leans over the gate and he's still, he's wearing those overalls and they're covered in shit and he's got no shirt on underneath it. like, all right. It's like piggy couture.
1254.32 1259.16 speaker3  Oh boy.
1258.16 1268.00 speaker1  What's happening?
1266.22 1274.00 speaker3  You got my key? Let's try it.
1273.00 1279.00 speaker2  One more time.
1278.00 1292.84 speaker3  That's why we're here. We'd like to talk.
1291.84 1295.68 speaker1  for me.
1292.84 1313.72 speaker2  Well, Leo, that makes me want to talk to you even more.
1310.30 1315.72 speaker3  and I'll reach my hand over this fence here, which I'm doing now.
1314.72 1322.32 speaker2  Put your hands up. Oh geez.
1317.72 1326.12 speaker1  So now he's horrified and he puts his hands straight in the air and he's like, what? We're all good here.
1325.12 1333.60 speaker2  Let's sit down. Let's have a drink. And we gotta have, we have a few questions.
1332.60 1347.64 speaker1  Okay. Yeah. We come in. Oh, he comes back on his cell phone and he's like, George, George, the police are here
1343.32 1369.12 speaker3  They just came to return my key and now they're on the property.
1367.52 1395.60 speaker2  was on your property. You knew this. We told you this last night. I'm angry at this guy right now. I don't know him very well and he's not following my city cop orders and I'm kind of mad at him.
1394.60 1413.80 speaker0  Uh, I'm sorry. We, we kind of bum rush you right here like this. Uh, it's just, we've got a, we're all pretty hungover. We got a pretty strong case going here. That's uh, it's real messed up, but uh, there's a chance that Julie Maxwell's caught up in something here. We found out that you had a restraining order against her. We just wanted to know what that was about.
1412.80 1425.32 speaker2  What's up with Julie Maxwell?
1422.08 1427.32 speaker1  now and everything, I did everything fine.
1426.32 1441.20 speaker3  No, no. We know you got the restraining order against her. Yeah. We just wondered what was the cause of all that?
1438.12 1449.12 speaker2  I accidentally, huh. Wait, would we know about this case?
1444.62 1455.44 speaker1  Go ahead and roll, uh, not you Keith, but the other two who are in town. If you want to roll law. Yeah. Oh, bummer.
1454.44 1472.20 speaker0  Oh, awesome.
1464.40 1477.92 speaker1  uh, was involved in a manslaughter case for the death of Julie Maxwell's younger sister. He did a year in juvie.
1476.64 1483.16 speaker2  How old is he right now?
1481.12 1526.48 speaker0  Were you just testing his math? As soon as he hears Leo say that, would I have been like, Oh yeah, the Maxwell girls, like, did I know them?
1525.48 1533.68 speaker1  a lot of stuff happened. A lot of clinkers between then and now. A lot of TV dinners.
1529.94 1556.58 speaker3  They were going for a second degree, which is a cop. dead, but you didn't mean nothing.
1550.32 1559.58 speaker1  Second degree murder is any intentional murder with malice, a forethought, but is not premeditated or planned.
1558.58 1563.28 speaker3  A crime of passion.
1559.58 1585.36 speaker1  We're in a pretty heated moment in world right now. Definitely. All these memories are flooding into your brain. in his shirt. Luke, I think you said Keith Vigna has his hand on his gun.
1583.98 1595.08 speaker2  and him have going on. So I moved my hand from my gun to my taser. Keith, Keith, there's no need for that. I looked, I'm looking straight at Leo.
1594.08 1603.80 speaker3  Leo's a good boy. I'm a good boy.
1602.80 1605.80 speaker1  It's fine.
1604.80 1608.80 speaker3  We can talk right here. We can talk right here at this gate.
1607.80 1632.52 speaker0  Hey, Keith. around when I joined up with the force. It was, it was a bad time. Leo. I'm sorry we brought all that up. It's just, we've got a, we've got a real sticky case here. Sticky?
1631.52 1638.08 speaker3  Hairy. Hey Leo though, have you had any contact with Julie in the past few weeks?
1637.08 1654.56 speaker1  She stayed away. died on December 1st, 15 years ago.
1653.56 1701.76 speaker3  Bad day for her parents. No, it's really funny. Leo, where's the chief? Leo, do you know anybody in town that drives a white Toyota? What?
1699.28 1708.92 speaker2  Tell me if you know anybody that drives a white Toyota.
1707.92 1714.12 speaker1  Roll human. That's exactly how I get it. Yeah.
1713.12 1717.12 speaker2  I got a 74. On a what?
1716.12 1720.12 speaker3  Oh, for real? For real.
1719.12 1728.12 speaker1  Damn. He, he is scared. He is very, very scared.
1726.48 1756.04 speaker3  We are not our best today. We're a little unfocused. It just seemed like the right thing to do. I just want my key back. What happened? Well, we were hoping you could fill in some blanks earlier.
1755.04 1773.18 speaker1  There was a what? And he immediately gets back on the phone. Did he? He turns around and he's like walking back towards his truck.
1770.92 1789.64 speaker3  Yeah, I don't know.
1788.12 1796.16 speaker1  And he hands you the phone.
1795.16 1810.96 speaker0  I'm George. We're up here. We're returning your brother's key to the lot. Yeah. Yeah. I got to tell you though, George, we found a body last night out there at the yard.
1809.96 1819.20 speaker1  What kind of body? Are you talking a weirdly coyote? Talking coyotes?
1817.40 1821.76 speaker0  We found a dead woman on your property.
1820.76 1828.24 speaker3  What?
1826.24 1866.28 speaker0  Is there a time you guys can meet us down at the station? Get off our property please. We're heading out of here right now. What does he say? What does he say? I want to talk to him. Let me talk to him. I put him back on with Leo. What does he say?
1864.44 1880.34 speaker3  made a copy of that key. Hindsight screwed the pitch, bro.
1879.34 1887.46 speaker0  Yeah, it's like three o'clock. So it's only a couple hours. If you're concerned about it, we could watch the house.
1886.46 1893.18 speaker2  I'm going to stay here. I'm going to stay here and make sure they don't leave before they go to the PD.
1891.66 1901.90 speaker1  Do you give Leo his key back? Okay, cool. As soon as he gets it, he gets it back on the key ring.
1898.58 1911.30 speaker0  I know it was real, real frightening, but we just had to figure some stuff out. You and your brother are going to come down and talk.
1907.58 1914.30 speaker3  And hopefully over the course of the day, we all get a lot more focused and disciplined.
1912.30 1936.86 speaker1  I bet y'all can do it. And you, sir, are my wings.
1934.42 1944.36 speaker2  but I don't want them to know that I stayed behind. Okay. Are you doing this to hide to see if they talk to each other?
1943.36 1954.82 speaker0  No. Which we also knew.
1948.94 1963.86 speaker2  I just, I wanted to see the comings and goings and kind of like try to be a little spy. Can I roll something besides stealth? That's a 30 on a 40.
1960.98 1975.74 speaker1  So yeah, you can find a nice spot where you would be able to keep an eye on their comings and goings.
1967.94 1998.18 speaker2  I get into my car and I pull it into a little clearing in the woods and my car is hidden, but I'm standing outside of my car, eyes scanning for now, because I think what I'm going to do is do a little walk around. Sounds good. Cool.
1993.82 2002.86 speaker0  from the hospital about Julie, maybe checking in with Drew about the chief, all that kind
2000.86 2056.94 speaker1  I want to read the chief's journals. Okay, sounds good. You would know from working with Chief Maggie Cook that she always carried a blue notebook with her everywhere she went. The blue one is on her desk. The yellow one is not in her office. There are three colors that these notebooks come in. The third is red and there is not a red notebook in this office. The blue notebook is a day-by-day journal of sorts. It has to-do lists, grocery lists, and random thoughts. It's basically her notepad app for a phone, but it's physical copies she carries around everywhere she goes. Oh my God, Zach.
2051.46 2079.94 speaker3  It's basically her notepad app for her phone, but she carries it around physically. It's her notepad. Yeah, that's what I said. Dog. Cat.
2077.46 2133.86 speaker1  November 3rd or something like that. So this is since November 3rd to December 1st are her notes. Chief is thorough. She's very thorough. She's very good at her job. But most of what's in there is notes about her job. Clark Bishop, as you sit down, what were you looking into? from the morgue and it turns out that Julie Maxwell pronounced dead. Not actually dead. Yeah.
2131.98 2140.78 speaker3  Pettymore values his face. Is it drew? She in the city. This is the hospital in the city. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
