0.00 27.80 speaker0  Hello, insert audience name. Damn, my producer wrote me a weird-ass intro this week. I'm gonna wing this one, y'all.
19.20 383.00 speaker1  It is I, Wolf the Dog, and I am here to gobble your biscuits and... bake... some... some biscuits. This shit's too hard, man. Let's skip to the fan stuff, why don't we? a thing you could easily do right now. Like, so easily. Just fuckin' do it, dude. Just type, I listen to "@pretendingpod", and you should, too, if you're nasty enough to handle it. The only thing that keeps me happy is my favorite DJ Dog the Wolf along with his dog, Wolf, The wolf that eats my recyclables? Or is this the wrong number? Either way, fuck Zuck Markleburg. Did you just call me Dog? The wolf? Get the freakin' hell out of here, buddy. Thanks for the email, pal. Hope you have a good one, friend. If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl, tag at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter, Hey, it keeps my throat wet with that good, good sloppy juice, so I can keep howling with the lush flow of words you hear now. And second, you'll get immediate access to 41 exclusive bonus episodes on the contention confidential RSS feed. Y'all know what RSS means, right? run by Thomas and sit in the holler outside a contention in the aftermath of season one. It has been an absolute blast. Joe, Luke, and Zach are playing members of the Pettymore family searching for the lost treasure of John Lee Pettymore. and if you're looking for a link, the links are in the show notes. It's, uh, it's time for the news. Last time, Shelly St. Blythe, Jimmy Corrigan, Vincent T. Bory, and Meat Hook went to the main offices of Holy Cow Farms, set off the alarms, and viewed some strange security footage of Dr. Brock Hargrave and his missing co-worker. With sirens in the distance, they bailed in the weirdest and most chaotic way possible. That's wild. He seemed like he had a good head on his shoulders, good gut instincts. Guess not. And Aaron mentioned that Hargrave has been digging holes out by the Zeitgeist, Taking us now to what is hopefully the most dysfunctional group at the cowboy's disposal, it's Hudson Freeman with Muscles R. Springs. ðŸŽµ
376.00 391.00 speaker2  ðŸŽµ All my muscles work like springs ðŸŽµ
389.00 395.00 speaker3  They made a promise to me.
391.00 405.00 speaker0  They made a promise to the boys. Welcome to episode three of this short arc with our guest player, Becca Scott. Woo! Oh, hello.
403.00 445.00 speaker3  I debated. You know? I thought about, what happens if I never come back? That's right. Did she wash into the ocean? Was there a rainstorm? Did she find some other way to get electricity?
444.00 457.00 speaker2  Wow.
455.00 461.00 speaker3  Oh boy, it was shameless.
459.00 464.00 speaker4  I was trying to get through his filmography.
461.00 473.00 speaker3  Because that shit was Fargo.
469.00 488.00 speaker4  I want a quick rundown of the interior of this stretch, Escalade, as well as the... and there was another place to go, but I may be wrong.
484.00 501.00 speaker3  Let the DM direct it where the story is. Don't tell him he's giving away where he wants us to go next.
496.00 526.00 speaker4  and I think after that phone conversation with both Aaron and Arin Strummer... Vincente is going to make a little more money after this. That's right. And there's a telescope in the top. Dr. Brock Hargrave.
524.00 532.00 speaker3  Sam Luke gets luck. Luck.
530.00 575.00 speaker4  Hey, I'll split it with you. We each have half a luck. That sounds useful. or you don't have luck. It's like a switch that's turned on or off. And when you do have luck, you can turn your luck off by changing a dice roll and you change the dice roll just by switching the numbers. So if it's critical... Just like real life. Numbers match. So you can't ever use luck on a crit. That is a fun little wrinkle in this. Boomtown.
573.00 587.00 speaker3  Our listeners are not educated people, so...
580.00 664.00 speaker4  And for the wonderful, wonderful role-playing in the last couple episodes as me took, I would like to award a luck here to Becca. Probably going to give it back to Luke. Who looks like what? Who's doing what? Who's driving what? Heading out to the outskirts of the city, out away from downtown, out away from the district, headed inside, set off the alarms, called the alarm company, made it worse, and then talked to a security guard and talked to the woman who you knocked out. She saw some of your faces and saw your stretch. Dorothy. Yeah, Dorothy saw your stretch escalate drive away as well and left her there, headed off into the night to the zeitgeist. I mean, not only did you talk to the security guard, you got up to some legitimate escapades.
662.00 669.00 speaker3  I remember the long person.
664.00 675.00 speaker4  But you also got there in the first place by running two blocks away to fire gunshots and draw their attention.
670.00 678.00 speaker3  Because the rest of us got winded on the stairs.
675.00 691.00 speaker4  Carrie and Joe's character.
684.00 699.00 speaker3  and he's pouring Perrier in champagne flutes for the three people in? I'm in there, yeah. Hey, thank you. I really appreciate that.
698.00 703.00 speaker4  Oh, hey, thank you. Oh, you can't pour a drink for the...
702.00 734.00 speaker3  It's your game. It's a Perrier.
733.00 746.00 speaker0  She chugs it.
744.00 751.00 speaker3  Carbonated water.
750.00 770.00 speaker2  Yeah, this is new. I didn't steal this one though.
768.00 791.00 speaker3  Double door refrigerator? Double door refrigerator.
789.00 795.00 speaker4  Oh, no.
793.00 802.00 speaker3  I was really hoping you would say just silent.
795.00 833.00 speaker4  Yeah, just a situational awareness is the most important asset you have at any given time. I bet Shelly got to the gin.
831.00 839.00 speaker3  We're used to a kid if we make it out of here.
835.00 947.00 speaker4  And should we all invest in a stretch Escalade? For the lifestyle. You guys are heading to the Zeitgeist, which is an abandoned space needle. And I think that Dylan B. from Deadwood, South Dakota did an excellent job describing the Zeitgeist. So I'm just going to go ahead and read this. It'll give you some backstory, some history of the Zeitgeist within the city that you would all kind of be aware of. It is primarily aesthetic by design and it fulfills this purpose to the detriment of all others. The free outdoor observation deck has rusted and fallen away into the surrounding woods. The expensive rotating restaurant is quietly creaked to a halt inside. Its facade is as weathered and gray, but when the Zeitgeist's lights blink on among the foothills, the weary citizens of the nearby city will still sometimes prod their children and tell them again that the aliens have come, cresting the horizon. And the children will laugh or cry or ignore them altogether. In its heyday, celebration packages included neon mocktails and costumed servers, the parting gift, a white cotton t-shirt that read, I was thinking about turning this place into a t-shirt the whole fucking time you were reading that and then they did it for us. You don't get any of the profits. Sorry. The Zeitgeist is bright and gaudy and it makes no sound. The forest's silent carnival.
945.00 950.00 speaker2  Dylan, where's your podcast?
949.00 981.00 speaker4  It's your podcast. It's heavy. Good luck.
969.00 1009.00 speaker2  And after a few weeks of just wandering up and down the elevator, eventually she was abducted by a kind of creepy guy in a van and that was Fishface. Okay.
1008.00 1017.00 speaker0  Uh, wow.
1014.00 1103.00 speaker4  And you guys are heading out into... All of the restrooms haven't been cleaned in ages. The parking lot is overrun with weeds and shit from the bathroom. Just pouring out, making a flowing river down the hill. It's a long, long hill. This parking lot is simply on an incline. One should park sideways according to where the parking spots are. But if you park according to where the parking spots are, you should use a parking brake.
1101.00 1113.00 speaker0  I had such glorious days here.
1109.00 1123.00 speaker3  He might, you know, find a little present we left over the years. Mark McGriff.
1120.00 1126.00 speaker2  And by present, you mean dead bodies?
1125.00 1143.00 speaker3  Got it. God's gift to the earth.
1142.00 1194.00 speaker2  The planet Krypton.
1187.00 1204.00 speaker4  It's just quite warm out this evening and the grass is green. Nailed it.
1200.00 1214.00 speaker3  If you were out here digging, looking for something, where would you start? Which area of this ground?
1213.00 1254.00 speaker0  Oh, um, perhaps. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go ahead and roll. That's a 40 on a 50.
1248.00 1267.00 speaker4  where I come from, we called him witching rods, but here's the thing. If you want to know where he's dig. If you want to know where he has dug.
1266.00 1316.00 speaker0  Is the past tense? You can see here that the dirt has been de-grounded. We should start our search here.
1310.00 1342.00 speaker4  The trees kind of surround you and looking down, you see mound after mound after mound. They're at the ends that have not been filled in, but the rest are clearly where the ground was dugged up. Digged. And then it was splatted back down, slapped on into the ground.
1341.00 1355.00 speaker3  Fucked and un-fucked.
1354.00 1379.00 speaker2  I know signals.
1376.00 1400.00 speaker4  For a grown man you might need to stab upwards of a dozen times to really put them down.
1399.00 1402.00 speaker2  No, I don't like being taught things.
1401.00 1410.00 speaker4  Maybe you should join his criminal enterprise.
1408.00 1417.00 speaker3  If you need to, we try not to do it all the time though. It's the 21st century.
1415.00 1436.00 speaker0  Perhaps you'd like to become an archaeologist?
1433.00 1463.00 speaker4  Meat Hook can kind of figure out what's going on right now. Becca, I've shared my screen with you.
1457.00 1495.00 speaker2  There's a backwards L and then a tiny little L and then a little straight line with two mounds. And then, you know, like an F but missing the other across line.
1490.00 1537.00 speaker4  The letters are interacting with numbers on the alphabet in a direct way. So A is one, B is two. He's like, figure out this Braille puzzle, motherfucker. You absolutely got it. And you also notice that the H, C, and F seem familiar to you for why? Hard cousin fuckers.
1536.00 1542.00 speaker5  Perhaps if I...
1540.00 1550.00 speaker0  If I put an exclamation point here, there would... Holy cow farms.
1545.00 1595.00 speaker4  Wait, are the numbers also important, or did you just have her translate it from letters to numbers back to letters? Actually, you know what? I don't even know if that's true. It's how this online Braille translator works. Nice. Everything matters, Joe.
1589.00 1603.00 speaker5  It all has significance, okay? The stars? They were put there to send us messages.
1602.00 1638.00 speaker3  And that's how I got here in the first place. I'm doing freaking mythical quests on the side while I'm running the family business.
1637.00 1642.00 speaker5  Tell me. You might not be real.
1641.00 1659.00 speaker3  What? What does that even mean?
1657.00 1667.00 speaker5  But your intelligence is artificial. Do you ever think about that? You're the simulation, maybe, man.
1667.00 1702.00 speaker3  Roll grip. If that's true, I do not pass my grip. I want to think really hard and whatever the first thing that comes to my mind, that is what I believe the message is.
1694.00 1715.00 speaker4  First things first, first thing in your mind, mounds on the ground, dirt all around, the space needle above you, the zeitgeist.
1713.00 1719.00 speaker5  You were sent here to tell us that, so I'm with you.
1718.00 1739.00 speaker3  Vincente then tries to see if he can just float. He's doing like the Chris Angel mind freak float thing where he's just actually up on one like tippy toe. And he's like, I'll try, I'll try later.
1737.00 1771.00 speaker4  The empty ones are the ones that have been filled.
1770.00 1779.00 speaker5  Ford Escort.
1773.00 1799.00 speaker4  Back out in the parking lot, Meat Hook is seeing this Ford Escort in this parking lot with only your two other cars. No one else is around. It's really silent here. You hear some crickets. When you go up to it, you see that it is locked. Looking through the windows, you see that there are zines all over the ground called Gnathic News, spelled with a silent G.
1797.00 1802.00 speaker0  Gnathic News.
1800.00 1834.00 speaker4  I think that Meat Hook would know all about Gnathic News.
1831.00 1895.00 speaker3  So he is going to try to break into the car and steal some items. Real criminology.
1887.00 1906.00 speaker4  Little, little pieces of glass just bust into this Ford Escort just ruining the person's day who owns this car.
1905.00 1912.00 speaker3  Hit me with those searches.
1907.00 1928.00 speaker5  Just a classic Gnathic news. Nothing going on here. That's not enough.
1926.00 1940.00 speaker3  Yeah, I got a 55 on a 40 so I did crit fail.
1932.00 1953.00 speaker4  We always forget that and so with the 69 that is going to completely outweigh the critical failure on the part of Vincenzi Bori. So you just saved him a D4 of damage cutting himself on the glass that you busted through there. Oh, she's definitely going to use it on cool shit in the car instead.
1952.00 1955.00 speaker3  It applies to everything.
1954.00 1957.00 speaker4  It applies to everything.
1956.00 1965.00 speaker3  It's situationally excellent all around.
1958.00 1990.00 speaker4  So as you go through this car you find there's an avoided ID for a Rowan Fitzpatrick. Marie Marie. Discord super mod. Absolute brilliant person, kind tea drinker Marie. Thank you.
1987.00 1994.00 speaker3  She's threatened to ban me from the Discord before so fuck you Marie.
1993.00 2009.00 speaker0  Just kidding.
2008.00 2011.00 speaker4  He meant Discord.
2010.00 2015.00 speaker5  What did I say?
2014.00 2042.00 speaker3  Join the Patreon for not free. And pay us money when you join the Discord.
2034.00 2047.00 speaker4  They are wearing a brat pit band tee and tweed blazer over the top of it.
2045.00 2081.00 speaker5  I mean they got a Nothic News in their car.
2069.00 2096.00 speaker4  So you've run into Rowan a couple times they're just like an androgynous dude and they're 30 somethings hanging out making zines talking to people about Bigfoot and UFOs in a very monotone voice.
2093.00 2105.00 speaker3  I assume you don't have a cell phone.
2102.00 2114.00 speaker2  You think I want them knowing my every move? The lizard people.
2113.00 2122.00 speaker4  Meatloaf?
2121.00 2147.00 speaker0  I wasn't upset. Hey it's Meatloaf.
2145.00 2161.00 speaker4  It says Rowan Fitzpatrick and it has a phone number.
2154.00 2192.00 speaker3  Vincente puts his reading glasses on and pulls out his like iPhone 2 and is like yeah can you read those numbers off to me? And he's like holding it really close to his face and he plugs in the numbers. 4206969. 4206969 area code 836. Nice got it.
2189.00 2218.00 speaker4  What are you guys doing as you're looking at these holes? When you said the tower light I assumed you meant like a flashing airplane light that's still on it right? Yeah.
2217.00 2221.00 speaker3  But there could still be lights inside.
2219.00 2236.00 speaker4  And the generator like fucks up and like twitches out. No. But it's fucking cool and it is but not right now.
2235.00 2242.00 speaker0  Was there a reason these holes are here?
2237.00 2252.00 speaker4  What do you make of these holes doc? Do they look like your standard anthropological holes?
2246.00 2267.00 speaker0  I don't understand why he would have been digging here. There's nothing of significance in this area. I don't uh... It's baffling to me.
2259.00 2400.00 speaker4  As you call Tri-Gate Supply it's like 1045pm and you get a message. That was new. Beep. Beep. And you hear scuttling and someone like trying to silence their phone. Hello do you consent to being recorded? And you see an androgynous 5'7 30-something with unkempt curly red hair and dark circles under their eyes. Wearing a brat pit tee. Yes, still. Cuffed straight-legged jeans, Doc Martens and a tweed blazer. And when they're holding out this Panasonic RN-163 micro cassette recorder. Who the hell are you? My name is Rowan Atkinson. I am sorry. That's not his name.
2399.00 2409.00 speaker5  If you don't come clean about the...
2405.00 2435.00 speaker3  And I'll burn down the perfect print too. And my callback number is 4226767. Bye.
2433.00 2442.00 speaker4  Yeah, what do you find? What is some stuff you'd want to drop in a hole?
2441.00 2465.00 speaker3  A giant figurine of Bigfoot. Like a carnival stuffed animal Bigfoot.
2464.00 2496.00 speaker4  I snatch it out of his hand. They have just like a wildly blank face on and they're just, okay, so is that a no? I am not trying to get myself killed. I am doing investigative journalism and research. Why are you here? What brought you to these woods? Have you seen the man digging here? With the hat. Cowboy hat.
2495.00 2512.00 speaker0  Cowboy hat. He likes it. Do you know Dr. Hargrave?
2507.00 2581.00 speaker4  I am investigating what he has been up to. He has been seeming very sketchy. Immediately they've got a card in your face and it says the Occult and Unnatural Investigative Journalism Association, Rowan Fitzpatrick. Yeah, you told us you were an investigator. How do you know Dr. Hargrave? He said he'd been acting weird lately. Yes. He did not come to the meeting last night. His body a little, you little spooky club? I followed him and I saw him with the shovel and then I saw the holes in the ground after he left. He does scare me a bit when he, I mean you know him, he is... A dastardly bastard, yes. And a bastardly dastard. We are friends of Dr. Hargrave's. We're trying to get some help for him. Can you tell me everything you know about his activities in the last few days? Knees and toes, yes.
2580.00 2583.00 speaker3  Shelly, what do you think?
2582.00 2591.00 speaker0  So he's been coming here for days now.
2584.00 2603.00 speaker4  I just followed him last night but, and then Rowan, they kind of point to the holes in the ground. I mean it takes a long time to dig holes so... Maybe two, three holes a night, you know, if he was up for it. That's what she said.
2602.00 2635.00 speaker5  Thank you. Just a regular tackle. Oh, I do one.
2631.00 2703.00 speaker4  You take Rowan Fitzpatrick directly to the ground and they are like, Oh my goodness, the smell. And that's like the first thing that they say is their face kind of hits into the soft, you know, summer humid ground below. Sewage, water. You can still kind of smell the sewage from the parking lot a little bit, but not as bad up here. The corners had the most foul images I had ever seen.
2702.00 2705.00 speaker5  I knew it.
2704.00 2711.00 speaker0  The classic reason.
2706.00 2727.00 speaker4  Sorry to lie to you about the images. So, if we're all here to investigate. All you know is that he was acting funny. You don't know why. You don't know what brought him here. He is interested in occult and unnatural things, such as I, seemingly such as you all are.
2723.00 2746.00 speaker5  Do people go to this meeting that I heard you talking about as I snuck up through the woods?
2728.00 2748.00 speaker4  Yes. The Cult and Unnatural Investigative Journalism Association is a tight-knit group of comrades who believe in investigating and making journalism entries into the world about the unnatural and occult findings that we get leads on.
2747.00 2777.00 speaker5  How come nobody ever invited me? Answer the question. That's a load of crap.
2776.00 2797.00 speaker4  No human role needed.
2792.00 2799.00 speaker3  What kind of organization are you running that wouldn't want to invite her? I'm mad at you, kid.
2798.00 2895.00 speaker0  She is a perfectly good basement creep.
2887.00 3030.00 speaker4  I would call him a core member for some time, as he used to work with a group of cowboys or something. I'm sorry, he told you about his work with the cowboys? Well, yes, because he was changing direction philosophically on how he felt about the unnatural. Previously, his work had been to get rid of the unnatural, but now he would like it to be more in the light and be written about journalistically to show the people the truth of the world. I think Shelley and Jimmy share a glance. Gross. He gets rock hard and says, we're going to have to kill Dr. Brock Hargrave tonight. Happy cat factory. He was rambling at the last meeting he was at and he was talking about... Four days, looking back, that was when we had the last meeting and I saw him. He was rambling when it was his turn to talk about some run of numbers and holy cow farms and something... What was he calling it? It was... They're literally scrolling through their phone on their photos and they're like, Oh, I did take a picture of, yes, here and it's the words, it's words, it's letters. It's A-N-D-E-N-P-I-L. That is correct. Space and A was capitalized. Space, capital Z-V-E, space, capital R-L-O-R-E-N.
3029.00 3041.00 speaker0  Ooh, and I rolled a nine. Nine on a 50.
3040.00 3046.00 speaker4  And you picked German?
3043.00 3061.00 speaker0  Can I, I want to pull back the curtain. Can I? I don't think I'm going to need two languages. And he says, take German.
3058.00 3095.00 speaker4  And he was like, okay. And I didn't say anything. Because in my mind that just adds up.
3094.00 3102.00 speaker3  Mine, Italian. What the hell does this mean?
3097.00 3111.00 speaker0  German is a little rusty, but it roughly translates to...
3108.00 3120.00 speaker4  It says, Andenpilsverloren. Andenpilsverloren.
3119.00 3166.00 speaker3  Lost to the fungus. Hey Meat Hook, do you know anything about the fungus? Fungus? Yes, that sounds like Meat Hook's alley.
3163.00 3192.00 speaker4  That's right. I was paying full and total attention and that's why I was totally with you.
3191.00 3208.00 speaker0  Thank you.
3199.00 3213.00 speaker4  I don't think he made it as far as you did. He just showed us that. I didn't know that it was German that meant something specific. Where did he say it was from?
3211.00 3236.00 speaker0  In his presentation, he did not explain the words he showed on the screen.
3233.00 3265.00 speaker5  It sounds like maybe his friend got lost to this fungus.
3264.00 3286.00 speaker3  Which one? Thank you. You want to drop it? I'd rather give them to my children. Nope. Maybe if they don't do anything in the holes, you can grab them out of there. I don't need them after that.
3283.00 3334.00 speaker2  It's just a vibe I got. I didn't actually know that about your personal life. I'm much better going up.
3333.00 3337.00 speaker3  There's giant Mario mushrooms all over the place.
3335.00 3346.00 speaker4  Yeah, growing out of each of these holes in the ground, no. This fucking toadstool runs by. Looking around, yeah, you don't see any mushrooms about, no?
3345.00 3387.00 speaker2  Except for meat hook. Don't eat that. No, this is...
3386.00 3390.00 speaker0  Nope, bye.
3388.00 3398.00 speaker3  This seems maybe like a conversation we have at the top of the tower.
3396.00 3415.00 speaker4  As you're heading up to the top of the tower, this conversation is going on. I feel like if there's no power... Yeah, there's no power right now. The lights aren't on, so the elevator doesn't work.
3412.00 3434.00 speaker0  It used to take forever, even back in its heyday. It surely is on its way down. Roll luck. Yep, no power.
3433.00 3447.00 speaker4  Electrical science.
3444.00 3473.00 speaker2  If you open the top of the elevator car, climb up on top. I don't know if that's going to get you up any faster. That's like climbing a rope in gym class, you know?
3465.00 3488.00 speaker4  You are like part of the way up and like a koala, just like stuck, just chilling. You're like, you know, in your heart of hearts, if you continue to go up, you can try, but it might not go well for you. You might slide down and hurt yourself.
3486.00 3505.00 speaker2  Looks like it's stairs for Meat Hook.
3504.00 3515.00 speaker0  Yeah, I have two. Meat Hook, I appreciate the effort, but if we must take the stairs, we must take the stairs.
3514.00 3527.00 speaker4  Or stairs if you like. Yep, I failed.
3526.00 3529.00 speaker3  I passed.
3528.00 3537.00 speaker0  Jimmy piggyback ride.
3535.00 3561.00 speaker4  So, did Meat Hook succeed or fail? You can go ahead, Morgan. You can go ahead if you'd like, but everybody else is... It's bad. All this stuff is very bad. You're right. It's out there.
3559.00 3568.00 speaker0  Everything you know to be true is true.
3567.00 3577.00 speaker4  Wow. But here's the thing. Nobody else can know it. They're not strong like you.
3575.00 3586.00 speaker3  The feeble little minds will break. Society will collapse.
3585.00 3598.00 speaker4  Urchin with nothing. But we are all fairly comfortable men.
3597.00 3600.00 speaker0  The status quo must remain.
3599.00 3626.00 speaker4  It must. It's the Delta Green way, unfortunately. Who is your father Vincentian going to rob? If people don't have any more money because they know about all this bad stuff.
3623.00 3635.00 speaker2  Everyone will have everything that they need because we'll all understand the truth.
3633.00 3661.00 speaker0  We are quite fragile as individuals.
3659.00 3675.00 speaker4  99 flights of the zeitgeist.
3669.00 3697.00 speaker3  And share it amongst your, what's that little shack called that you live in? That's it. You can tell everybody in the hold. You can make your zines.
3694.00 3701.00 speaker4  Which is the real information, the truth. She can make her zines about Bigfoot.
3700.00 3749.00 speaker3  Right, yeah, just not this stuff. You can talk about it with your three dads. I don't know why the stars aligned to show me zines. I'm still trying to figure it out and you can help me. And look at the telescope. It's like, I have a lot of money and a lot of other people don't and that makes me feel good.
3748.00 3797.00 speaker4  It's beautiful.
3796.00 3800.00 speaker0  It's only reasonable, yes.
3798.00 3815.00 speaker4  I'd be gun dad. You could be crime dad.
3808.00 3818.00 speaker3  So you can be the number one time spent child, but still there's not going to be a ton of time. I'm a very busy man.
3816.00 3821.00 speaker4  Vincenzi's probably not going to be in your life a whole lot.
3819.00 3875.00 speaker3  But the telescope will always have the telescope. And I want to look around this restaurant for the telescope. Keep them at arms length so that they want to be close. Yeah, that's what kids are for. And as scapegoats in case I get caught doing something. That's why you got eight of them. Hey, and Meat Hook, I got nine again.
3874.00 3878.00 speaker4  He's not in the zeitgeist with you.
3876.00 3881.00 speaker0  He's been making little like asides.
3879.00 3931.00 speaker4  Meat Hook, you can't know these things. He's on the ground below. He's walking up from the parking lot area toward where these holes in the ground are which are kind of directly underneath where you are but still within sight. And he is walking up with two people and they are both on those like kid leashes. They are behind but they are not being dragged on the ground but they are being kind of like forcefully led. However, they both seem to be passive and just kind of like stumbling forward.
3924.00 3940.00 speaker3  I would like to grab the telescope that I know is in here and aim it at them and then ask Shelley if he recognizes the people.
3934.00 3943.00 speaker0  God damn Hargrave, he's here. He's with two people. They have leashes and I don't know him.
3941.00 3999.00 speaker4  I can see his big hat and shiny shovel from up here. It's just like a man and a woman, they seem to be in their mid-thirties and they're just dressed normal like they were maybe out at a bar or something and now they're here. Kind of stumbling lifelessly behind Dr. Brock Hargrave. And as he's kind of walking up, he's not looking up or around, he's just looking at these holes. He's got his eyes set directly on these holes in the ground. I don't think that you should immediately notice that Rowan Fitzpatrick has been with you this whole time. I don't think you should drop those down yet. Shut up. I think we should be quiet. Also, are you interested in three dads? You seem a little way with yourself.
3998.00 4013.00 speaker2  Hold on, you just let anybody be your child?
4011.00 4019.00 speaker3  The whole way we were walking back to you guys.
4018.00 4021.00 speaker4  You fucking freak.
4020.00 4024.00 speaker5  No inflection at all.
4022.00 4029.00 speaker4  I would have in the past, but now I do not.
4027.00 4034.00 speaker3  Meat Hook, you were so right about this freaking nerd.
4032.00 4060.00 speaker4  Okay, well I am not going to leave even though I feel like I should. Right, but your voice should leave. Shut up. It's like 25.48 meters. That's a thousand feet.
4059.00 4064.00 speaker3  Yeah, it's pretty short. So it's like a sad miniature Space Needle?
4063.00 4066.00 speaker4  Yeah, it's a bummer.
4065.00 4068.00 speaker0  It's the Las Vegas version of the Space Needle.
4067.00 4094.00 speaker4  Even they, I think, have a pretty cool one.
4093.00 4104.00 speaker2  I never let anyone. They only take pictures in my sleep, you know? I can't stop them.
4103.00 4110.00 speaker3  Fish face.
4109.00 4124.00 speaker2  Hey!
4121.00 4139.00 speaker0  I feel that we've now located Hargrave. Wasn't that part of our mission? I think that now is the time to act.
4137.00 4266.00 speaker4  And he takes his shovel that he has in his hand. We should have dug in the other holes. And then he pulls a pipe out of his pocket and lights the bottom of it. An acrid smell begins to rise up toward the top. He's smoking the crystal. And he starts shaking his head violently. And Hargrave takes a deep breath as he pulls a bit on the man's lead and he positions the swaying man a bit closer to himself than the still leashed woman. And that's when Dr. Brock Hargrave shoves one of his fingers deep into his own ear. Wiggles it around and then puts that whole eerie finger into his own mouth wrapping his lips around the bottom knuckle and sucking. And he reaches out toward the torso of Dr. Brock Hargrave who just stands there and watches as this dude scoops into Hargrave's abdomen with both hands. Like he's doing the breast stroke or walking through a beat curtain. And he crawls into the belly of Dr. Hargrave and disappears from view entirely.
4264.00 4334.00 speaker0  What was that fish face?
4332.00 4334.00 speaker4  I think this is something where it's the end of the episode. I knew that. How did you not know your cliffhanger voice?
