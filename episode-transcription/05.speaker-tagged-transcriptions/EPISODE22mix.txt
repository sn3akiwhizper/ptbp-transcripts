0.00 69.88 speaker0  Hello my students, it's your professor Wolf the Dog and I'm here to teach you all about what's synthesizing here on 694.2 PTBP, Contentions only form of education. This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from AtKCruise36 on Twitter who tagged at PretendingPod, an A plus thing to do my students. The people of contention are fed up with our incompetent gun-crazy police force. We the committee to unite the nearby townsfolk refuse to let good, hard-working folks be terrorized by the likes of a petty more firing wildly into the sky. Coffee is always hot and so, so black y'all.

73.00 87.52 speaker0  However, Professor Wolf is here to talk facts with y'all. It's time for the news my babies.
84.92 195.36 speaker1  man with feelings, perhaps. Is it a robot if it has feelings? Keith Wigner found a single piece of music called The Rise of the End in the bench of the stringless piano. A suspiciously planned out set of seven buildings, six encircling a large one in the center that sits on Lake Combe. A similar design was found drawn on a piece of paper in the pocket of one of those two corpses they found in the pit under the trap door that Bishop fell into. Then in James the Millworker's house, the officers remembered that he died in Chief Maggie Cook's house with a bullet in his head, face down and a plate of foot meat. They also remember the contents of the present that she received from an unknown source the night she took off. on the smooth pelvic area. It is an M made out of four double helices.
188.40 262.68 speaker0  Today on December 4th, during a nap, I was eating a glass of water and began bleeding all over the floor. I looked down and my dog Wolf was lapping up the blood. It's your life and it also cuts you with no back bone.
261.08 272.40 speaker2  That's the second smartest thing you've ever said.
270.44 280.04 speaker3  than going all the way out to your house.
275.88 284.44 speaker2  forward to getting back to my home, just how I like it, you know.
280.04 291.88 speaker3  Maybe we should all stay, maybe we should all stay at Clark's house so that we're together just in case something dangerous happens. I got plenty of beds. Yeah, he does, he has plenty of beds.
288.72 297.12 speaker2  I know we're just not a giant robot but are you a little, maybe you should go sleep with
296.12 302.64 speaker3  encounter. No, I'm not afraid, I'm just thinking that we should probably all stick together at this point. You know, some weird shit's going on.
301.64 306.88 speaker2  No man, I like-
302.64 311.64 speaker3  What if the ooze, what if the, what's the closest waterway to you, you know?
310.64 340.56 speaker2  Okay, well- You guys can come, do you want to come stay out there, Keith? No, not really. Okay. Zeke's a Hazard DVDs. You guys have your- And Smokey and the Bandit.
338.44 342.56 speaker3  The cruisers are still destroyed, right? That is correct.
341.56 346.72 speaker2  Yeah, I've got my- Yeah, for sure.
345.72 365.92 speaker3  Oh wait, and then do you have a- I don't think I do. So you know, guys, I think it'd just be easiest for us to all stay at Clark's house tonight since we only have one car.
362.20 387.44 speaker2  You have an impound lot so you can just take cars that have been impounded. You know, I think Vigna's afraid of something and maybe just invite him over for a little sleepover or something. He doesn't seem like he wants to- He seems spooked, you're right, you're right. I'll put a word in his ear for sure, let him know he's welcome.
386.44 411.04 speaker3  Yeah. Oh, hey, so you sure you don't want to have a sleepover over at Clark's? You know what? I'll take you up on that.
408.04 416.92 speaker2  Yeah, I got a spare bed, Keith. Okay. You like Salisbury Steak? It will probably be safer for you tonight if you're with Clark.
415.52 436.96 speaker3  Do you have Game Show Network? Cab, Wheel of Fortune, whatever's going on. I like that Cash Cab. We're going to watch Wheel of Fortune, but I gotta warn you, I get a puzzle sometimes a time. Hey, well, let's see if I can't bestie on at least one round.
435.96 466.02 speaker2  Ooh, good luck. Yeah.
464.68 475.30 speaker3  Do we have one of those? There's a pretty sweet 91 Toyota Corolla.
474.30 483.22 speaker2  No. No. Okay. No.
480.30 489.62 speaker3  There's a cool lime green GEO over there. No, I'm good.
488.62 492.46 speaker2  Nice.
490.62 495.62 speaker3  I'm going to just stay in my cruiser. My stepdad had one of those.
494.62 500.22 speaker2  I think that year and everything. It was so wide.
499.22 524.14 speaker3  It super is, yeah. Okay. And here are the keys for those. And yeah, as soon as we get the cruisers back in working order, I'll make sure that you're in them. the impound lot, probably.
521.90 527.34 speaker2  I mean, definitely not a great idea. I mean, don't like, you know...
525.86 537.86 speaker3  Hey, Drew, I'll see you around, buddy. Okay. Follow me back over there? Yeah, of course.
536.86 539.86 speaker2  How old is it?
538.86 544.86 speaker3  Nine thirty, maybe now. Sure. Are there any late night food spots open? Yeah. I mean, you can always get a burger at Burgatory.
543.86 549.06 speaker2  And Daily Fuzz is still open.
548.06 564.36 speaker3  That sounds... I tell you what, I've been looking forward to my chicken nugget dinner. So... Okay. Bring me a burger, bring it over. That's fine. Well, I mean, really what I'd like to do is have a bishop night. Do you have an extra for me?
562.76 572.78 speaker2  I got a Sal's Berry Steak I've been holding back. You can have that one.
571.78 600.98 speaker3  Whatever you want. If you want to go first. I think maybe... Yeah, we'll have you guys here first. You got a driveway that's two cars wide, right?
599.98 601.98 speaker2  Okay.
600.98 609.16 speaker3  So I park behind you then. Yep.
606.26 615.62 speaker2  in and head toward the kitchen.
611.34 641.54 speaker3  I go to my trunk, I pop it open. grab a bag of chips and a couple of Slim Jims and I drop it down, close my trunk and I walk in and I walk in the open door, close it behind me and I look at Clark, I go, I brought a couple of snacks.
637.30 674.74 speaker2  I know we got a couple of meals going, but you know, I figured for maybe, maybe we could I go to my freezer and I pull out the chicken nuggets and I pull out the Salisbury steak and Clark has always ever done one frozen dinner at a time. So he's kind of baffled right now and he thinks about it for a while and then he puts both
671.52 684.88 speaker3  describe Clark's like a furniture situation?
680.66 712.78 speaker2  across from the TV and everything is kind of dated. but perpendicular to it. there Keith. Mi casa, su casa, as the Spanish say.
708.30 750.18 speaker3  of the television cause I know that I'm in your house, you're cooking me food. I did bring snacks over, but I don't, I don't feel like I should sit in your recliner. So I sit down on that side of the couch, but I also do scoot the couch up a little and I, I immediately, I move it back, scratching up the floor again as I move it back. Clark winces. I'm sorry, man. So I get up and I, um, no, it's, it's, it's fine.
748.50 761.10 speaker2  You're just Clark, just sit down. Just sit down. No, I got to keep an eye on these. You know what?
760.10 810.78 speaker3  Don't worry about it. I, you know what? I'm the guest. I'm, I'm here to take care of you. You know, this is a nice little bonding.
807.98 826.86 speaker2  Uh, I do want to emphasize that the house is immaculate. Like I keep it pretty Spartan and clean.
824.02 885.76 speaker3  No, I, I almost smells like plastic burning. I almost forcefully like put my hand on Clark's chest and push him down into his comfy chair. I kiss Keith. I'll get it. and um, I see two microwave dinners stacked on top of each other and the plastic on the top part is just melted into my Salisbury steak. So I pull them out and like the chicken nuggets are cooked well and like I peel the plastic top off of that and I'm like, Oh, these look good. So I grabbed the chicken nugget, I swish it around in the mashed potato part of that and I pop it in my mouth. I'm like, yeah, that's pretty good.
884.24 900.88 speaker2  It burns the fuck out of your mouth. Yeah. All right.
896.72 936.36 speaker3  So I, and then I get the Salisbury steak, the plastic is melted onto the Salisbury steak. I try to peel the plastic off, but like I, it takes me like eight different peeling off the edges to get in. There's still a plastic on there, but I'm like, yeah, what, I mean, I'm a guest in this house. Fuck it. Uh, what is this like a, like jeopardy or something?
932.36 945.96 speaker2  So I go over and grab that and I kind of start setting it up in front of me and I look up Go, go take that over to that couch over there.
944.96 962.84 speaker3  You can. You can use it. Just lay, lay down and, and don't worry about it. I'm just going to sit right here.
961.84 981.32 speaker2  me.
974.88 999.52 speaker3  use my plastic fork to cut a little piece of my Salisbury steak out and I put it on his chicken nugget tray, but it's the one piece of Salisbury steak that has like the plastic still melted on top of it. You know what? I will take that tray and I take the tray.
993.52 1007.68 speaker2  I go sit down on the edge of the couch and I'm like, okay, let's uh, let's just play
1004.36 1016.28 speaker3  I uh, those chicken nuggets are cooked very well by the way.
1013.40 1029.44 speaker2  that into my mouth first and I'm like, I do like that. I do really like that. I gave you just so you know.
1021.28 1041.56 speaker3  I mean, and I, um, I, uh, take, I take like a little bite of it and like, it's okay.
1036.52 1053.40 speaker2  stand up and start walking back to the bedrooms and I go into like a linen closet and I get out like a pillow and some sheets and I go into the spare bedroom that has a bed in it but is bare and I get the sheets all on it.
1052.40 1066.80 speaker3  Dude. This show is kind of like hangman real quick.
1064.24 1070.28 speaker2  I got a 39 on a 55.
1066.80 1077.44 speaker3  I got a 73 on a 50.
1076.44 1086.76 speaker2  Nice. Anyway, that was happening. You came up against a master. Yeah.
1085.76 1111.08 speaker3  Okay. I think I might go home honestly, but oh, you don't want to. It wasn't to, it was to hang out with you, Clark.
1110.08 1126.06 speaker2  Yeah. Of course. I had a great time. He knows deep inside that Keith was just real scared tonight about all the things we'd seen today and he knows that he's, this is his way of reaching out for comfort and this is time of need.
1121.64 1133.36 speaker3  Um, I go to sleep in the bed that Clark has made for me. Yeah.
1129.96 1142.54 speaker2  I go ahead and go to bed like right, like after that conversation, I'm like, I want to, I want to pass out.
1140.18 1318.34 speaker3  in besides my own tonight? There's definitely an open room. So I, um, I clean up our TV dinners. I move the couch back. I quietly leave Bishop's house. This is your niece. It's Ferguson's daughter. What's her name? Oh, my niece is Francis beans. Okay. So I'm coming to you first with this opportunity. I know you have no love for your parents, especially after they left everything to Fergie, He killed them when he needed the money. Some of which I think you deserve goes to me upon his death. We deserve it. He deserves it. And she holds a lighter underneath the note and she lights it. She kind of motions. I throw the note off to the side as it's burning. I look around. Yeah. Six. You see that no one is out and about right now. No one's watching. I reluctantly get in the passenger side of her car. Maybe follow me in your car. And she drives up and hops on the highway and heads toward the city.
1314.06 1354.82 speaker2  you go over the bridge that travels over Coles Creek. Looking out the window of your borrowed and pounded vehicle, you see animals of all size farther north you drive. What do you do upon arrival? Hey.
1353.82 1357.50 speaker3  Everything's ready to go.
1355.82 1366.50 speaker2  Uh, what time did you tell them to meet? 2 a.m. All right. Why don't you get here around midnight? Okay, perfect. All right. I'll see you then. All right.
1365.50 1370.50 speaker3  Okay.
1369.50 1372.50 speaker0  Hopefully.
1371.50 1413.30 speaker2  Okay. Like John Lee Pettymore gives himself a moment to, uh, to imagine that just like, what if, what if it does all go well? minutes just like letting himself feel that and kind of trying to de-stress a little bit. He's going to try to get a little nap before, before, uh, everything goes down. Absolutely. It looks like someone broke in and rifled through all of your shit. What the hell?
1412.08 1426.02 speaker3  What the fucking hell?
1424.66 1503.62 speaker2  has been knocked over. I would do such a thing. God damn it. First this whole fucking town goes to shit and then somebody steps on my Smokey DVDs and now it's fucking, what a goddamn horrible day. on the floor. I'm gonna fucking kill that son of a bitch. That idiot, incompetent, coke-addled, motherfucking ransacker, I'm going to kill him. Yeah, I keep several. It's cheaper than insulation. You just go to the stadium. So the sprint car racing, they just used to give me big ol' bags of the popcorn.
1500.14 1509.50 speaker3  If you keep it in plastic, it doesn't go bad.
1507.70 1523.94 speaker2  They definitely won't chew through the popcorn. It does, I mean, now that it's raining down on me here, it does look like the squirrel,
1522.94 1537.50 speaker3  it.
1535.78 1637.58 speaker2  Would you be worried about that? No. Well, it was dark, but it would have taken, like, excavation to get it, yeah, and I don't think I saw any signs of that. I think he's too angry to sleep. John Lee Pennymore just needs to stay focused, and he is unspeakably angry at Keith, but he's going to rechannel that anger into just energy for tonight. What he's going to do right now is smoke a big ol' bowl and put on smoking the bandit and just de-stress for a minute and just fucking try to forget it all for a minute. I just got to fucking, er, four hours. Drew gets here in two hours. I just got to calm down, watch Smokey, and then tomorrow I'm going to kill Keith Igna. The doorbell rings. Gun draw, and I go to the door. Yeah, it's Drew. Hey, hey, buddy. Hey! Okay, cool. And he is holding a pistol, and he is holding it, like, by the top. I'm going to give you a quick rundown on all this. See, here's the safety. You got that off. Yep. Yeah, you want to put that on. Oh, okay. Let's go. I got a shooting tree. Let's go back and shoot the shooting tree for a minute. not good.
1635.58 1638.58 speaker3  Yeah, you don't think he's going to shoot you.
1637.58 1676.54 speaker2  No. Unless things get really bad, I want you to just keep that safety on, but I do feel like we've taught you how to hold this and look more intimidating to the mafia. I couldn't agree more. I look very intimidating. Man, Emmett made the right call. Emmett's so cool. I didn't even consider, oh my goodness. Think about that, buddy. Okay.
1675.54 1685.30 speaker3  I'm 57. No.
1684.06 1711.02 speaker2  We're getting you laid. We're going to get you laid tonight. Okay. Oh my goodness. Okay, cool. Is there a strip club in town?
1705.94 1722.46 speaker3  No, there's just a, there's an auto mechanic called sassy reds. Okay.
1719.98 1759.30 speaker2  So it's coming up on 2 AM. Okay. I'm down to eight. Get ready. I'm just going to check to make sure that's all on place. Just out to the woods. I just kind of make a bird call and a similar, but slightly different bird returns. I love the great Northern collar. It's my favorite bird. Drew.
1758.30 1766.02 speaker3  Oh, I've never heard of that one. I'm a fan of pigeons.
1764.10 1924.26 speaker2  Uh, I'm going to do a little bump too. Okay, cool. Well, we've established that John goes to work at like 7 AM. Hey, uh, uh, Drew, what the fuck are all the kids doing in the van? I have absolutely no idea. I don't- How do you know the Duke? I-I- God, we should have covered some of this before. Probably. He has perfect hair, perfect teeth, a perfect jawline and he is wearing the fuck out of a bright white suit with a red rose pinned perfectly to his lapel and he begins walking up to the two of you on the porch and he just stands there. He's the Duke? Are you Drew? Drew's here. I believe you have some money for us? We got the cocaine on the property here, store it away, uh, why don't you show us the money?
1922.54 1956.86 speaker3  handcuffed to his wrist. far away, they're like on the other side of the van, they all kind of line up, like staring at you, all holding the shovels in the exact same way in front of them.
1952.54 2056.90 speaker2  Drew, go take a look at that briefcase, make sure everything's alright. Keith, his britches too big. Too big. Yeah, so they fall off. Fucking first. Anyway, alright, just hold onto your britches buddy, we're not through this yet. Alright Duke, you see that maple tree over there? Mr. Duke, while you got your children there digging, can I ask you a couple questions? Go for it. Uh, why you got children out here digging for cocaine at two in the morning? is that correct? Okay, so about half of it.
2049.38 2069.82 speaker3  And the Duke walks over and unlatches the handcuff from the other end and hands you
2065.90 2078.86 speaker2  Duke, uh, Duke, Duke, show us the other case.
2076.94 2083.74 speaker3  you and gives you a peek. Looks the same.
2082.46 2093.82 speaker2  Your boy should see the hole.
2092.38 2098.94 speaker3  as they did the first time.
2096.50 2119.54 speaker2  You don't know nothing about, what kind of crime is this Duke involved in? That's fair. Uh, how dangerous do you think he is? I mean, he just brought children. the trees right now. What? Yeah, man. Overwatch.
2118.54 2123.10 speaker3  Like... I thought it was just me and you. That takes so much stress off my shoulders.
2121.54 2151.06 speaker2  I should have probably told you, yeah. But I don't see a fucking, I don't see any goons or muscle, just all these children. And, you know, I don't want to take candy from a baby, but it seems like we could just take the ten million dollars and all the cocaine. What kind of retribution would that bring down upon us? Maybe. But then we'd just have to sell the cocaine again.
2149.50 2164.86 speaker3  I've been pooping all day.
2162.66 2189.98 speaker2  It's twice, there's twice a difference. Maybe he's got somebody watching us, I don't know, but... John? What's that mean? Just kidding.
2188.98 2195.94 speaker3  and he's like...
2193.86 2201.54 speaker2  Me too Drew, you're a fun guy.
2195.94 2223.86 speaker3  And the children are now taking the second pile of cocaine and loading it up into the trailer behind this van. And when they are finished, the Duke walks toward you and undoes the lock on the handcuffs
2219.78 2280.66 speaker2  I love it when a deal goes off without a hitch. Me too. This went off far smoother than I expected it to. me a shitload of money. It seems like I'm in a position to give a little bit back and I slip them like a grand. What is this for? What do you know about Marvin Glass?
2279.66 2302.82 speaker3  Marvin Glass. That'll be one thousand dollars. He buys in bulk. Like his uh...
2301.82 2324.78 speaker2  I don't fucking know. Neither one of them have ever been much of a threat to me. What are y'all hearing in the city about what's been going down under contention?
2323.78 2341.18 speaker3  soon.
2340.18 2359.10 speaker2  that's all about. Hey, Mr. Duke, is there any significance to the rose you wear? I can't smell, I don't have the sense to smell, it's a joke. You're pretty fly, I mean, it's a good thing you had all those kids to do that digging
2357.94 2381.90 speaker3  I absolutely agree. These are all your kids?
2376.58 2437.70 speaker2  hops into the white van with Jesus Christ Ministries painted on the side, and begins the wide turn necessary to head back down John's long gravel driveway. Drew? Yeah? Should we leave tomorrow? I hadn't, I hadn't thought about it. Drew, you wouldn't, would you leave the boys at a time like this? Cause fuck it, man, now that you said it, I think I might.
2432.70 2445.70 speaker3  has gotten stronger over the past couple days through all this. You know, I like Clark, Keith can certainly kiss my piss.
2443.70 2494.70 speaker2  Kiss my piss. really weird holding this. Hey buddy though, listen, you're a cocaine millionaire now. Hold onto it. You might need it for protection. And he takes it back, and he's holding it correctly this time. Awesome. I don't think I've invited him. Jimmy. Not him. Not the shrooms guy? No. These are younger cousins. Fair enough. Like the youngest one is probably like 15. Okay, yeah.
2493.70 2508.26 speaker3  Oldest? 40. Nice. Do you want to describe that?
2501.70 2550.70 speaker2  So about eight very clearly Pettymores just step out from behind some trees in a circle around everywhere, and the youngest is 15, the oldest is 40, but they all are unmistakably of John's family. Like the blood is strong and perhaps intertwined. And yeah, John- Nope. John gives them each 10 grand out of his suitcase and says, good work boys. I'll see you all at the reunion. They all like- Oh yeah, and I toss them a 24 pack of keystone light.
2550.70 2566.54 speaker0 
2561.70 2588.22 speaker2  Clark, after you go to bed, you are having a little trouble sleeping. and then you hear him leave and you hear a car start up and then you hear the car back out of the driveway. I want to get up and go to the front door and lock it.
2587.22 2636.36 speaker3  You do so? Okay, cool. alongside your house and it flows down south from the lake at Centennial Park up north.
2630.20 2697.58 speaker2  in the creek closest to your house, he leaps from the water and begins screaming and waving I pass 23 on a 29. Okay, cool. to a close.
2692.78 2863.16 speaker3  light from the middle of this small stonewalled room. You are sitting in a chair across a stone table from a man with grey hair under a white called himself the overseer. The seer claimed that the now king was to hold some very important knowledge but would need to have the restraint to not abuse this power. See, Richard was given this knowledge, but he couldn't handle it. He lost his mind and killed his two nephews. The overseer, disappointed, eventually passed the same knowledge down to a Henry Tudor so he could whoop Richard at Bosworth. Henry VII held this power and eventually passed it down to a reliable and trusted confidant, thankfully not his piece of shit son. This knowledge was passed down repeatedly, abused and respected, respected and abused But a grand purpose was never found. The politician, not the singer. Soon after being elected to the Senate, he was walking near his home when he came across the first known xenonimatode. He sought out Robert Byrd, the Senate minority leader at the time to share his newfound understanding of the world. Thankfully for the world, Byrd was among those carrying the knowledge of the overseer from centuries before. Together they formed a small circle of men to hold the weight of this realization. Now today, we carry on their tradition by keeping the darkness out of this world. We are the opaque rampart delaying the destruction of life as we know it. Welcome to the circle of knowledge.
