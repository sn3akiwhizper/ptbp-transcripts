0.00 14.24 speaker0  Howdy-doody, my spooky-poopies.
8.68 136.40 speaker1  And I'm here to provide sustenance to all of my little baby buddies. I'm tootin' at y'all live from 694.2 PTBP, Speakin' of weird shit that I'm forced to read that makes people mildly uncomfortable, this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Kyle. Remember, listener, Kyle asked for this. Kyle writes, To my darling wife, Steffy. Hundland, Hundland. Ow! Cough, cough, cough. Hundland, Hundland. Uh... thanks for that, Kyle. I know I did. At certain parts, but mostly I didn't. If you wanna write up somethin' for your guttural wolf to how, tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook, or write up a five-star review on the podcast app of your choice. Screenshot them deliciousnesses and send them my way. If you refuse to post on social media, but you still wanna support the show, give us money in exchange for a whole bunch of bonus episodes, access to submit NPCs and locations, behind-the-scenes livestreams, exclusive T-shirts, and et cetera, et cetera. It also helps give Zach the little bits of sausage he needs that keep him goin' as he produces, GMs, and edits this fine show. Links to all that and Wolfie's merch store are, you guessed it, in the show notes. For those just tunin' in, I'm Wolf the Dog. You are listening to 694.2 PTBP,
133.72 146.64 speaker0  and this is the news.
141.84 207.12 speaker1  and his childhood connection to the City Action News Studios. And when Julius was a child, crawlin' around gnawin' on marbles that were, Well, back then, Cal Colorado was the frothy film of the slot bucket, my babies. sided with Julius against Cal Colorado when the team was asked to follow a lead that Cal balked at. Let's see if we can top that. Here's a brand new rock act. It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.
202.96 230.88 speaker0  Cos my life is great And it's all my fault
228.84 253.60 speaker2  Hell yeah, dude. Find somebody in to piss play. looking at the charge. Cos I was talking to somebody and stuck my phone in my pocket while we were messaging. Oh no, how much? That's still insane for a month.
251.36 259.08 speaker0  That is insane for a month. But I was hoping, oh wow.
255.48 296.52 speaker2  You just made me feel fine about this, I guess. And instead I have a month of Bumble Premium. I guess I'm gonna have to make the most of this. Yeah dude, go fucking wild on Bumble now. Fucking unlimited swipes. What is Bumble? Bumble's the one where the women message you first. So you never get like anything live? No, no. It's all a trick.
294.76 338.96 speaker0  I don't think they're real.
336.88 340.56 speaker2  Also go back and listen to episode one.
338.96 346.36 speaker0  If this is your first episode, this is the perfect time to go back a couple episodes. We only got three now.
344.48 350.68 speaker2  This is the only time where we can say just go back a couple.
347.48 355.04 speaker0  Now is the easiest time to make sure you go back now.
353.48 388.80 speaker3  and you go back a couple, I don't have a fun folksy word for nine. Say it like Mr. Lemon.
387.84 395.28 speaker2  Oh yeah, I do. Yeah.
393.16 411.24 speaker3  this episode starts with a shot of Jeremy standing in the parking lot, standing in the empty spot where the can van just was holding a hot iced latte and two energy drinks.
407.80 418.88 speaker0  It's about now in the van that Beck remembers that,
415.00 447.36 speaker3  And he begins sprinting down the road through traffic holding these three items. We didn't get very far, did we? We did not get very far. We're stuck. almost immediately. So let's see the inside of this van. Like 6 p.m. in the middle of downtown. Shit is. So? Shit's fucked.
445.32 452.48 speaker2  That's actually the beginning of the TikTok. He's asking the person in front of us in their car
451.64 464.04 speaker0  What? Does the city suck? Yeah. We've only known him for two episodes,
461.04 472.80 speaker3  but there's no fucking way Cal Colorado's saying that. But you could try to talk him into it and scene. Wait, that's at the end. How do you start one?
471.24 478.00 speaker0  Fire.
476.36 481.36 speaker2  That's why you don't yell fire in a theater because they'll think it means well.
479.84 493.22 speaker0  It's time to start. but he still doesn't have a clear idea
491.00 502.22 speaker2  Julius is scrambling for ideas and just kind of looking around and he sees a pizza at Cal's own shop. And he looks at Cal.
500.74 509.42 speaker0  Oh my God. And he looks back. And he looks back. Oh my God. Oh my God.
506.10 542.94 speaker2  Cal is blinking and smiling and here at TikTok, so he's telling you the time. I had a sensible lunch and breakfast. I, no, I don't think I could eat right now. Just a bite or two. I'm sorry, I don't know if you've noticed, but I do keep my figure trim. And I just point to like people walking. Man on the street, I love it.
538.26 558.10 speaker3  it's like way too big and it's drooped over his eyes almost. He's walking like he's sitting down, but he's walking. And- I'm sorry, Zach, what? He's walking like he's sitting down, but he's walking. So he's ass- You've seen people, right? Oh man.
557.26 564.98 speaker2  Yeah, he's like- Zach, what do you think walking?
562.42 567.58 speaker3  and kind of like dancing around. Cal has a microphone in his face.
566.26 575.14 speaker2  You, sir, what are you doing?
572.36 588.98 speaker3  like sitting dance thing, like a silly walk. And he's just like, you know, I like to get through the city by dancing. You see these cars here? They're stuck. I'm not stuck. I'm free.
587.14 593.78 speaker2  A disturbingly ableist message. From the Cal zone.
592.74 611.66 speaker0  From the Cal zone. we try like you try to dance like him with him. That might be amusing. Oh, a street man. Okay.
610.78 625.28 speaker2  Cal is nailing it. Cal is like athletic. Cal watches this guy move and then moves like that.
623.86 632.14 speaker0  in your basketball days.
629.90 653.86 speaker2  Well, yeah, I mean, I played some D and when they got in the Cal zone, they got slapped down. Your sign off needs to be, and that's another slam dunk from the Cal zone. Oh yeah.
651.94 660.62 speaker0  he's doing, he's maybe adding a filter and he's putting the text over the top and it's when you in the Cal zone.
659.54 663.78 speaker3  That face when. What's the song?
662.78 682.00 speaker0  Whoop, there it is.
678.62 692.62 speaker2  like just stoked that it's perfect. And he just adds the caption, another fresh hot Cal zone.
690.66 705.66 speaker3  As soon as it's blasted out, literally the second it posts a TikTok, you get a notification on your cell phone, Julius and Tife has hearted the message that he sent you.
704.30 729.74 speaker2  Make a TikTok, bitch. Oh, right. saying that we posted a TikTok or something like that. Breaking news, a new TikTok is dropped.
725.64 743.18 speaker3  As you guys are all reconvened, as you were all- Jesus.
741.48 758.82 speaker0  Can we start the season two over?
755.48 784.44 speaker3  of traffic in the rear view mirror on the can van. And he is holding one hot ice latte and two energy drinks. And he approaches the van and he's like, They were not happy about that order, Julius,
782.02 794.20 speaker2  He takes it and he's surprised that it is somehow both very hot and very cold. And here are these for you, Beck.
792.16 801.56 speaker0  that he has with him that has a bunch of extra cans
797.94 812.88 speaker2  Cal has Julius's phone and he's just watching the TikTok like repeatedly with a huge grin on his face.
810.64 822.76 speaker0  and if you could get me a black coffee, please.
821.80 851.54 speaker3  as Julius. It's a group text between Taif, Cal and Julius. And he says, her name is Kaylee Silver. Shout out to Distant Egg Song in Houston. Hey. For Kaylee Silver, we'll likely meet her soon. Kaylee Silver, it says, specifically asked for Cal because he is a truth above all type of guy.
846.66 856.10 speaker0  She grew up watching him on TV and she trusts him.
854.18 863.94 speaker2  then I grew up watching you on TV. That gives him pause. Sure. He's heard that. That can go a lot of ways.
861.22 886.52 speaker3  immediately back is Jeremy. The quickest coffee run, I time myself, thank you, that I have ever made. Thankfully, because, and he points behind him. I went to the U zone.
885.06 896.74 speaker2  Cal kind of realizes what he's done. He like realizes they're in the street and not the office
895.46 905.62 speaker3  from where he came from.
904.02 927.18 speaker2  I said what I said. or we could go find out what's going on with backwards running, man.
924.86 948.46 speaker3  And then eventually it kind of opens up and you guys get to your destination And on that piece of paper that you have says apartment 836.
946.90 956.22 speaker0  of the outside of the building. So he's got a tripod under an arm and his case of camera equipment.
955.34 960.74 speaker3  What's Cal doing?
959.02 980.66 speaker2  I was talking to this girl on Bumble and we've hooked up a couple times and she was like, hey, this guy just sent me this really weird dick pic and I don't know if it's like diseased or what. And she just sent it to me.
979.34 989.06 speaker0  Cal has a crazy life.
986.74 995.90 speaker3  Was that like a play of some sort? Of like just showing off your personality early?
992.74 1007.62 speaker2  No, again, this is a person I've had sex with.
1006.06 1026.66 speaker0  No, no, no. She was like this dude sent me a dick pic
1025.26 1066.42 speaker3  Did you look at it again, you freak? It won't be a dick though.
1065.58 1081.38 speaker2  Fucking idiot.
1080.38 1089.46 speaker0  Why did I have taste buds?
1088.38 1097.38 speaker2  Fucking pervert. Where the fuck were we? Well, I was jacking off to that dick pic in your bathroom.
1095.62 1102.90 speaker0  and you're asking Cal what he was doing.
1099.30 1112.02 speaker3  I asked Cal what he was doing and then we got into that. Julius, what are you doing as you guys approach this mid-rise?
1109.30 1124.98 speaker2  to get some B-roll of him hitting the eight button on the elevator. you can always use B-roll.
1123.82 1137.14 speaker0  Oh yeah, that's good. Beck is always, the B-roll doesn't have to be for that story. Like videography is his passion
1135.70 1151.30 speaker2  he could use for art projects. He's like, is there anything that could be like a quick shot? Oh yeah.
1149.42 1160.58 speaker3  You're familiar with his YouTube page.
1157.24 1164.54 speaker2  I definitely pictured a John Wilson how-to situation. It's not funny.
1161.86 1180.10 speaker0  Yeah, well, I mean, he was an inspiration as far as the idea that he's always filming stuff. He inspired how-to John Wilson. Who knows how or when he'll use it.
1176.18 1181.38 speaker3  experimental YouTube page inspired John Wilson
1180.10 1187.10 speaker0  to make how-to.
1183.64 1193.22 speaker3  the doorman sees that your city action news and opens the door and lets you get in.
1191.10 1199.90 speaker2  interaction with the doorman? Where we try to get in?
1196.50 1224.58 speaker3  you're on your way up to the eighth floor of this building. And when the elevator door opens, you are in a stagnant, stale hallway. It smells like old cigarettes and Chinese food. It's not a bad smell. It's kind of comforting if you're me, but if you're me. I lived in an apartment building
1222.96 1231.54 speaker2  It's propulsive even.
1227.62 1275.94 speaker3  And the carpet in the hallways of this apartment building is only made more timely in its interior design by the wallpaper that lines these hallways. It feels almost suffocating. Apartments 809 to 814 are to the left and then 819 to 836 are to the right. So how do you knock on the door?
1272.26 1286.36 speaker2  I get my TikTok out and hand it over to him and I'm like, get like the surprise on her face when he knocks at the door.
1284.66 1297.82 speaker3  You hear the heavy breathing coming from the other side of the door. Cal makes this big step back. Shh, is it Cal?
1296.62 1302.34 speaker2  Wow, okay cool.
1301.08 1308.42 speaker3  I'm in a lot of trouble. Can you help me?
1307.14 1312.98 speaker2  Could you let us in?
1311.74 1346.54 speaker3  Is she saying all that? into apartment 836 and shuts the door, this 20 or 30 something and a choker necklace repositions a towel against the door's threshold and your noses tell your brains to tell you why. is a sight that could affect your grip on reality.
1345.06 1348.10 speaker2  so that you can get your camera out.
1346.54 1356.74 speaker0  But there's a little bit of resistance that Beck was getting a shot of it instinctually.
1355.18 1358.98 speaker3  That way we know where everything is.
1356.74 1373.38 speaker2  Are you familiar with the impossible geometry
1370.98 1387.22 speaker3  which is your grip on reality. It is directly attached to the score of power. Power times five is gonna be your grip. We're replacing the word sanity in this campaign. Losing your grip.
1386.10 1393.74 speaker0  Yeah, we like it a lot.
1391.14 1399.86 speaker2  I don't know, some kind of situation in the past, you could really make it old timey. Oh yeah.
1398.74 1404.98 speaker3  Almost anything, yeah.
1404.14 1410.06 speaker2  I don't know what you're planning. Foxy.
1407.34 1415.94 speaker0  I mean, that's more of a teens, but yeah.
1414.34 1419.74 speaker3  So, I need you all to roll grip. I failed.
1417.90 1429.72 speaker0  In fact, it's one of his best skills because it's related directly to your power which is my highest. Yeah, exactly. I rolled a 76 on a 75.
1428.34 1442.46 speaker2  Damn. Well, Cal is an old professional and he rolled 39 on a 60. Yeah, Julius got a 62 on a 60.
1440.70 1450.46 speaker3  This is not your job. Why are you here? She shouldn't have called you. This was just a story.
1448.94 1459.98 speaker0  and oh fuck, there's a body. That was not on the docket today.
1458.86 1462.30 speaker3  Julius looks.
1460.82 1466.54 speaker0  Beck definitely looks.
1464.34 1513.78 speaker3  as you see there's a streak of blood on the floor of the apartment where Kaylee Silver clearly dragged the body to then put her on the couch. You notice out of the corner of your eye, Kaylee's wincing as you all look and see the body of another 20 or 30 something by something sharp enough to get the job done but blunt enough that some of the cuts look more like the skin was ripped apart. where this poor woman's neck and throat should be with blood caked all around it, you can see the top of her spinal cord and you can see right down her trachea. Did you pass that grip check?
1512.78 1521.38 speaker0  39. Now he's there.
1520.54 1525.10 speaker2  This isn't the first time
1523.86 1536.22 speaker0  He's seen bodies before. He just wasn't ready for it. He thought he was, yeah, this was a fluff piece.
1532.66 1545.54 speaker2  He thought he was prepared after seeing the legs. He wasn't prepared for this. He vomits quietly in the hallway.
1544.70 1572.26 speaker3  Two. Two. One. You lose two grip, Julius, and Cal, you lose one grip. Cal is taken so far back, he is out in the hallway.
1570.62 1584.18 speaker2  and seeing a little bit of it. Even worse, he's just frozen there staring at it.
1582.00 1595.16 speaker0  he's a little more in the moment for a second, and he's suddenly aware that he's standing in a room with a dead body and a woman saying, I didn't do it, which sometimes they did did it. Yeah, sometimes they did his did.
1593.16 1598.72 speaker2  The most likely person to have did it is the alive person in the room.
1597.56 1615.84 speaker0  He's putting a little bit of distance between himself and Kaylee, just in case she's maybe got a knife on her currently, even still.
1614.12 1641.00 speaker3  under the coffee table that is absolutely dripping in blood. And Kaylee walks over to the kitchen and leans against the countertop and just turns back to you and is like, okay, I did it, but I had to do it. I did it, but I had to do it. You have to trust me.
1638.68 1645.28 speaker2  you've got to be getting this, right?
1642.92 1654.56 speaker0  to try and get micro expressions and everything.
1652.88 1688.72 speaker3  It was self-defense. She was, I don't know how to say this, but she was trying to tear me apart. Why? Get it together, Kaylee. Kaylee is a young adult. She's got dirty blonde space buns and she's wearing a pink crop top with neon green ringers on the sleeves and the collar. It's one of those happy bunny shirts. When you say space buns, do you mean Princess Leia buns? Oh, I guess kind of, but just like buns that are on the top of her head, like little buns.
1687.76 1695.16 speaker0  Did she have those?
1694.32 1704.32 speaker2  Yeah. What's her deal? Yeah, but in self-defense.
1701.76 1716.54 speaker3  were like all wrapped up in buns. and it says, it's not your fault, I'm blaming you anyway.
1715.28 1719.64 speaker2  That's Thomas's take.
1718.20 1725.28 speaker0  She said it was in self-defense.
1722.72 1741.24 speaker2  and he wants to, I guess, I want sincerity in her voice and then I'm also looking for signs of a physical struggle. Humant for her, forensics for the scene,
1739.44 1748.56 speaker3  She seems extremely genuine. Who is she?
1747.64 1760.08 speaker2  Who is she?
1757.40 1768.54 speaker3  It's spelled differently, but we're best friends. We like bonded on that. Is this what really,
1767.08 1780.56 speaker0  When we're talking about Kaylee at any moment, it could be two different people. One of them is dead.
1779.24 1782.72 speaker2  I did what I did.
1781.48 1786.72 speaker3  In the moment.
1784.08 1792.40 speaker0  that you regretted naming an NPC John and a PC John in the first season.
1789.60 1796.80 speaker2  Okay, but like, are we going to be talking to Kaylee for another 40 episodes or just right now? I think it's pretty fun.
1795.24 1800.16 speaker0  Also, Luke had an elegant solution. Carolee is her name.
1797.64 1804.40 speaker2  Kaylee, K period Lee.
1802.48 1852.36 speaker3  Carole is the daughter of Cal. Yeah, that's her full name. K-Y-L-E-I-G-H, Kaylee. Oh no. Oh, Kaylee silver, Kaylee gold. We're like, we're destined to be best friends. And for the past, fuck, 12 years, she's been my ride or die, you know? And then she comes at me, her eyes went somewhere else. She was just staring at my gut and she was trying to tear me apart. She was trying to tear me apart.
1850.16 1896.72 speaker2  that gold is better than silver? please say you got it. And she just nods. and there is usable footage, but basically like this segment can't air as is, right? we wanna discuss the best way to cover your incident here.
1893.12 1913.48 speaker3  Like I said to whoever I talked to on the phone, I trust you, Cal. I know that you believe in the truth and I know that you are gonna find it, okay?
1909.06 1926.28 speaker2  and he lingers a moment on her gaze and nods.
1925.08 1928.40 speaker3  I mean.
1926.72 1932.36 speaker2  Either way, Cal is walking away from, like he's huddling up.
1930.56 1939.56 speaker3  And Kaylee is just petting the cat and trying to calm down.
1937.96 1953.30 speaker0  he doesn't ever like to turn the camera off in a place like this, but he goes ahead and does it. You've been in a place like this before?
1951.72 1986.96 speaker3  None of you can think straight. This is not your job. This is not normal. You are not having a normal day. You have some serious decisions to make that might have ramifications on the rest of your lives. We have to call 911.
1986.12 1989.92 speaker2  Which is what he says. I'm looking around.
1989.08 1995.40 speaker0  Fuck yes.
1993.88 2021.52 speaker2  I'm looking for Mr. Lemon. But yeah, Julius is calling 911. 911, what's your emergency? There's been a... Wait, hold on, let me take that again.
2020.36 2024.80 speaker0  Yeah, that's true.
2023.16 2033.64 speaker2  Yeah, but that was like Mardi Gras in St. Louis. Like, I don't talk like that.
2032.80 2072.40 speaker3  911. Holy shit! Oh, that's downtown. Is that an apartment building?
2068.88 2088.12 speaker2  I didn't do it, but I know who might have. And they left. Julius is obviously not reading the signals from his partner as well at all.
2086.72 2092.08 speaker0  What are you, no.
2089.60 2098.84 speaker2  This is someone who knows more. Hello, Cal, Colorado, City Action News.
2095.96 2125.76 speaker3  They're, wow. Yeah, my name's Jennifer, and I am speechless, but I need information as soon as possible. Well, Jennifer. I, it was fine until now, I suppose. Tell me more about this homicide.
2124.20 2128.20 speaker2  You know, that's what I do.
2126.64 2144.00 speaker3  I do know that's what you do. I know.
2142.68 2173.84 speaker2  when I got to the city, but. but she says it was in self-defense, an act of necessity. The violence visited upon this corpse might belie that fact, but we are not the police. That's why we need you here to look at this.
2173.00 2185.88 speaker3  Take this as high as you can. Take this as high as you can. Take this as high as you can. Take this as high as you can. Do you know Obama?
2183.52 2190.84 speaker2  but I did interview him when he campaigned in the city.
2189.88 2193.84 speaker0  is of Cal and Obama.
2193.00 2198.96 speaker2  Sir.
2197.52 2209.96 speaker3  Officers are on their way and they will be there very shortly.
2208.40 2220.80 speaker2  We are journalists.
2219.20 2231.48 speaker0  Yes.
2228.32 2236.36 speaker3  Have you talked to the woman who said that she did it? Has she told you anything more
2234.72 2245.20 speaker0  Well, she told us she did it
2243.08 2254.28 speaker2  would be incredibly incriminating and it might implicate us in her crime.
2251.76 2264.92 speaker3  That would have been not as fun to role-play, I don't think.
2264.08 2268.96 speaker0  You're right.
2267.72 2276.32 speaker2  It might have to happen.
2272.68 2286.84 speaker3  are on their way up the elevator to your location right now.
2286.00 2294.92 speaker2  Ding.
2291.44 2323.76 speaker3  These cops bumble out of this fucking elevator. And they approach you. It's two officers and. Two officers come pouring out of the elevator. Oh, sorry.
2322.32 2352.80 speaker0  that I've got a good shot of them, I wanna kinda put the camera down tiny bit and I wanna talk to them before they talk to us and I'm just gonna say, You might let him ease you guys in there. Ooh, role persuade. I'm gonna go ahead and use my luck. Ooh.
2351.96 2360.08 speaker2  Awesome. Six, that's a good one.
2357.88 2374.96 speaker3  that he's about to talk down to you and as he goes to talk, he's got a frog in his throat and one of the officers behind him says,
2372.20 2411.56 speaker0  and like, I think at the end of the day, turning herself into the police is the right idea. I just think you need to make sure that she's convinced of that and maybe get to the bottom of why she did this about what put her in a state of mind to do this and maybe get more about like what was happening Yeah.
2410.72 2425.12 speaker2  Hahaha.
2422.52 2430.88 speaker0  and gonna just follow him into the room.
2427.52 2445.58 speaker3  She's hunched over and looking at her phone and she has wide eyes that cannot look away. And she's just staring at the screen.
2443.58 2459.20 speaker2  and like snaps. Kaylee? Miss Silver. I'm sorry, what?
2456.56 2465.00 speaker3  It records motion.
2462.84 2472.84 speaker2  She holds the phone up to you
2469.62 2529.40 speaker3  You see Kaylee gold before she became the corpse laid out on the couch. In this grainy video, she's sitting on that same couch, petting Ger, shooting the shit. In the kitchen, you see Kaylee Silver before she killed her friend. She walks through the background and grabs a beer from the fridge. There's no label on the bottle, all is well. Kaylee gold is laughing. Kaylee Silver takes a swig. Something changes. Kaylee gold's neck snaps like she's a dog and Kaylee Silver's a squirrel. Gold's posture gets weird. She lunges, reaching out for Silver's stomach just under the neon crop top. I need you guys to roll grip.
2527.60 2537.80 speaker0  I pass with a 26.
2533.70 2605.38 speaker3  You can see the fear and panic and confusion in her eyes, both on this Furbo footage on her trembling phone out of frame, but when Kaylee gold comes back into view, and she spears Kaylee Silver into and over the kitchen counter, out of the Furbo camera's view. and you hear a glass bottle break and a splash of beer hits the fridge. Then a heartbreaking wail. Kaylee Silver stands here, phone out, frozen, tears filling up as much of the eyes as possible without yet spilling down her face.
2602.86 2622.58 speaker2  I'm glad you could trust me. You're gonna have to go with the police now. Can you send me that footage before you go? but doesn't necessarily say anything to stop that.
2621.26 2639.78 speaker0  He doesn't normally do this. From behind the camera, he's a silent viewer, but he's now seen that she's 100% been truthful with us.
2636.30 2651.66 speaker3  and she can sense the cops on the other side of it. I don't think we closed the door. Oh, okay, then she can see the six cops just kinda like peering in, staring. One of them's got handcuffs in their hands ready to go.
2649.34 2657.26 speaker2  I load up the video that I just sent myself and like go to show it to one of the cops.
2654.30 2671.02 speaker3  As you do so, the other one walks in. Ma'am, you have the right to remain silent. Everything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
2667.42 2691.18 speaker2  Kaylee, the video shows you acted in self-defense. Just tell them the truth, everything will be fine. It wasn't normal. It wasn't. They'll find out.
2689.10 2697.06 speaker3  Can't have you in an active crime scene.
2694.10 2706.14 speaker0  to have kind of inched my way further back into the apartment to maybe get some wider angles of everything in the room?
2705.30 2707.58 speaker4  One.
2706.14 2715.78 speaker3  Yeah, dude, are you serious? I rolled a one. Oh my God, that's amazing.
2714.94 2723.98 speaker0  but it's fun. You can get any shot.
2719.58 2729.02 speaker3  you see that Kaylee Silver is an avid home brewer.
2727.66 2734.70 speaker0  That is super dope.
2733.46 2740.82 speaker3  Gold is the friend. As soon as Silver drank the beer, Gold's neck snapped to attention.
2739.98 2746.58 speaker0  Thank you for that.
2745.26 2755.86 speaker2  Also the kind of shit we would have spent like five episodes not finding out.
2753.98 2759.22 speaker4  Perfect, perfect impression.
2756.94 2765.82 speaker0  I want to get pregnant with you.
2763.18 2770.46 speaker3  I've been working really hard on the podcast voice.
2769.10 2777.86 speaker4  I want to have a baby with you.
2774.06 2815.78 speaker2  Julius texts his uncle, just like two thumbs up. and just shaking his head. And he starts to walk out and he puts his arms around both of you.
2814.62 2820.50 speaker3  You're my only hope.
2819.46 2844.58 speaker2  And he gulps. I'm taking you boys to the foundry.
2842.98 2855.62 speaker0  around the table. She was like, so did you zoom in on it?
2854.58 2867.50 speaker3  Had you? No. Did you then? No. Will you in the future? For you? Yeah. Jesus fucking Christ.
2866.14 2874.82 speaker2  No, please don't.
2873.54 2876.50 speaker3  Like I didn't watch any of that shit. Luke does.
2875.66 2878.50 speaker2  Donkey man.
2877.58 2883.78 speaker4  Oh my God.
2882.94 2892.14 speaker0  I know. I say again, can we restart season two? I'm bummed out.
