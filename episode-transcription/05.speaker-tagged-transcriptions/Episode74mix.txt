0.00 30.50 speaker0  Hey all you cool dogs and puppas, it's your best friend Oh Wharf the dog, and I am here to receive all the belly rubs live on 694.2 PTBP. If you rub my tummy, make sure you wear some kind of gloves that you can dispose of, because
29.50 102.10 speaker1  and ooze. that pretending pod they write, to Wolf the dog, from Mike Fardy and the Wonders and Blunders podcast. Dearest Wolf the dog, I can't hold back my feelings any longer. Your gravely tones, your otherworldly fluting echoes, your got-dang thickness, may the light of the blood moon guide you to me like I'm a dumpster full of night meat. Much love from Wonders and Blunders, a fellow horror comedy actual play podcast, and good luck to those contention boys. End transmission. moment.
95.98 140.34 speaker0  She never asks for nothing, yet provides endless bounty for me and my loins. Maybe, but probably not. There's a long list of suitors out there for little old Wolfie.
134.74 155.10 speaker1  That's the goodest, and speaking of having nice things, you can find more tasty content
148.82 184.14 speaker0  If you've listened this far, you very likely know about the subreddit and discord communities, these internet nooks and crannies blossom into havens of silly and supportive solidarity. Now time to get serious, because this episode is so, so very serious, seriously.
182.54 199.10 speaker1  very serious. Seems like the producer was worried about becoming accustomed to remote playing before
193.14 269.54 speaker0  Now remember to sit in those questions on the subreddit named episode 74, which it will clearly not be, as this right here is episode 74. Now let's get serious, my dear sweet innocent pups. By the time you hear the intro to this song for the second time ever, you will know the fate of the golden retriever called Bean.
263.22 352.46 speaker1  us more time to field questions for next week's plot talk, and also to give me more time to prep for this upcoming story arc. Now on top of that, I figured it wouldn't hurt to get some more practice in with this whole remote recording thing before we jump back into the nitty gritty good stuff, especially with the mishap last week with Thomas' gain controls. Well don't worry, we fucked it up again. This time Luke and Thomas had their audio sent crisp and clear to the zoom call, however they accidentally recorded their tracks with their laptop microphones instead. I have edited this session, and I believe it is quite listenable and even, dare I say, enjoyable, but it is not up to our standards for audio quality, and so we are using this as a learning opportunity, and we are adding another clearly overlooked but important task to our pre-recording checklists. Thank you, each of you, for listening and supporting this show, it means so, so much to me. Everybody clap on four and eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, wonderful. Thank you all so much for coming here today. You're welcome. I miss our finest of eves, here on Pretending to be People.
349.70 363.58 speaker0  How's everybody doing out there? Doing about as good as you can hope, you know?
362.58 367.98 speaker1  Uh, hold on.
364.58 373.22 speaker2  If I'm talking normal, I'm hitting like around 18 to 12. That's where I was last, well yeah, that's where I am now I guess.
371.98 380.10 speaker1  Where's your gain turned to?
379.10 384.14 speaker2  About one o'clock.
382.66 397.58 speaker1  I think you're probably good, man.
396.58 407.58 speaker0  Oh good.
403.08 426.62 speaker1  So let's get right into this, because it's already nighttime. The sun has been down for a minute at this point. I hope so. Maybe.
425.62 439.62 speaker0  Speed. Fuck.
435.38 483.42 speaker1  You all choose an animal you'd like to be. Bean was a revered member of the Contention Critter Coalition. The leader, a wise squirrel, is calling out to those who have survived by joining the newly founded Contention Creek Critter Coalition. They need the most highly trained, well-balanced strike team ever assembled to go on a near suicide mission to save Bean, the most thoughtful and caring creature in the whole coalition. And to pull off this rescue, you'll have to avoid the black goo and some humans too. First thoughts when you read that. And don't be mean.
481.58 487.26 speaker2  Yeah, be serious.
483.42 488.26 speaker1  Oh, there's like dead kids or something?
487.26 492.34 speaker2  Good. That's bad.
489.26 494.34 speaker1  Oh, their bodies are filled with maggots and shit?
492.34 550.94 speaker2  No, no, I do want to- No, actual shit. I do want to say everybody's body is filled with actual shit. Near suicide mission. It would be bad podcast.
548.94 774.66 speaker1  What if you do, though, die? Well, we'll see. That's my kryptonite. I didn't want to keep singing. Thank you. of the water. Numbed by the frigid waters or the cutting winds, this brutally arctic reality was far greater than the alternative. The contention critter coalition has made their home here in Coles Creek, the survivors rebranding themselves as the contention critter- fuck. It's always Cs, Thomas. When there's three Cs in a row, it's Cs. All my Cs are hard, dude. They rebranded themselves as the contention creek critter coalition for accuracy and additional alliteration. The contention creek critter coalition has gathered to hear an announcement from its esteemed leader and wisest member, the old grey squirrel called Stallone. Look around, look at what's left of us. Tired, empty, shivering, the enemy. And they point to both banks of Coles Creek where masses of writhing black ooze sloppily spill back and forth, attempting to nip at any animals near to the shore, but consistently careful enough to avoid falling into the water. Few here have survived without witnessing at least one close companion consumed by this unspeakable foe. But I hold high hopeful hearsay, our admirable, admirable and astonishingly astute ally, the golden retriever called Bean is still alive, though he is trapped. His person has continued to leave him locked in isolation. The wish should be clear to everyone now that water is life. Who among you are brave enough to take on this task? To liberate Bean from his prison of a pin at Hotel Motel.
770.50 818.50 speaker2  And I think he's probably been something of like a community organizer in these trying times. pigeon because he can carry messages between the creators of the coalition and he can understand humans so he can feed them info.
816.74 825.70 speaker1  Two of our finest. And who else? Who is willing to join these two brave souls?
825.14 846.82 speaker0  Did you say Beans? I know Beans.
844.58 860.66 speaker1  So what do we know about this character? What do the other animals know? And what is this name?
855.38 875.78 speaker2  And he recently escaped his master, and he's on the run. I don't want to interrupt our flow, but Joe, you're breaking up like crazy. At least for me.
874.10 882.74 speaker1  Thomas, what kind of dog were you? I didn't catch that.
878.10 922.18 speaker2  He's based off a dog I used to live with. One of my roommate's dogs that she had fostered and then adopted. He was a sweet, big old boy named Dracula. And he was just a big gray, maybe like a shepherd lab mix. Inky bones, but a lot of heart.
921.54 926.90 speaker1  I'll just say it.
925.06 936.66 speaker2  Clark was tasked with finding this dog.
932.50 941.62 speaker1  And Justin, a coward or are you taking this for spot?
940.18 1012.90 speaker0  Yeah, I'm just like, no, I'm not playing. I'm just going to hang out with you guys. Kind of undermine Zach. He's comfortable. He's hanging out. Uh, no, out of, out of the shadows steps, uh, a very small, but proud creature. It's a little chipmunk. Hey, I think y'all are going to need some leadership for this today. I'm chip Montgomery. Y'all know me. Y'all know me really well. Should have been president, but that's okay. Some peoples ain't meant for leadership. We know it's bullshit, but I'm here. Cause y'all seem like you could use an old hand besides old rusty here. My days are numbered. Anyway, I don't think chipmunks are long for this world.
1007.70 1016.74 speaker2  of a spiritual, uh, counsel, uh, chip.
1015.70 1047.54 speaker0  He's quite fat. Now his, uh, chipmunk for his grade over time, quite elderly, but still spry and full of sass.
1039.86 1076.18 speaker1  chip from rusty as looming in the background is this ooze that just kind of like follows you, like mirrors your movements as, as you've grouped together up front near this, uh, this elderly gray squirrel. how to get out of this Creek. The black goo is everywhere and he watches, he watches our movements and he wants us.
1072.10 1101.14 speaker2  Like what a dog who's, okay. Well, I think we, we gotta get water on it, right? How would animals do that? Yeah. it a big old dog shake and just flashes water everywhere. And does the, does the goo flee from the water?
1100.66 1104.18 speaker1  It does.
1102.90 1141.22 speaker0  That looks like it works. Chip Montgomery gets a little tiny like cap off of like a little nut and fills it with
1133.86 1143.30 speaker2  And because, because I'm, I'm pretty old and weak, perhaps if Tyler, who is spry and I
1143.06 1144.66 speaker0  Yeah.
1144.18 1152.98 speaker1  Get on my back. Come on, get on my back. You can use my collar as a, as a brains. Come on.
1149.46 1163.30 speaker2  You shake, you shake and clear a path. And then you leap over the goo. You got it.
1161.86 1181.70 speaker0  I like take off. land? I mean, is there, is there a space that this, oh yeah.
1176.02 1207.14 speaker1  So it's just, it is formed lines near the land just far enough, like a far apart from each other. Like the lines, like at the, like, if you're like heading to the paint in basketball, you got those lines. Did that make any sense? Am I making any sense? Yeah, no, it's free land. They are clearly, they want to consume, but they cannot get into the water.
1204.58 1220.42 speaker2  But an athletic dog could definitely clear the gap.
1219.06 1267.94 speaker1  I fly over. be like in a different group, like in a different gang that's not affected, like the privileged.
1264.98 1282.90 speaker0  Otherwise he's running back and forth, getting more water on his body, clearing a little bit more, coming back, clearing a little bit more.
1275.94 1293.38 speaker1  So basically in order to fully get out of this mess, you're going to have to roll either one of your special skills or dexterity, probably. I've got a special skill of jumping. He's a really good jumper.
1291.38 1299.86 speaker0  That's how he got out of his last yard. Yeah.
1293.62 1489.38 speaker1  So real quick explanation for how we're doing mechanics for this little one shot here. We're using the six stats from Delta Green, which are somebody else, please. For those six, they got to put those wherever they wanted. And then I said you guys could have two special abilities that would both be at 75%. And I guess we'll figure out what those are as we play the game. One of Joe's for Tyler is jumping. So go ahead and roll, baby. So as you fully pushed through this barricade of black goo, you can get rusty and chip up and through. Like if this was red Rover, you know, you would have came all over past. Jesus. and contention that leads from the highway down. You might not know this, uh, depending on how, uh, well-versed you guys are, but you do know where hotel motel is. As you have hung out with being a fair few times in the parking lot, where he hosts, uh, anyone and everyone who just wants to come and chill and have like a great time. As long as his person remembers to leave the door unlocked for him. Um, I'm going to roll a D4 to see, uh, which one of you this affects. And hopefully it's not Thomas. Uh, let's see. We'll do one is Luke. Two is Justin. I'm here. And four is Joe. And this D4 says. It's not a good thing as the four of you. As the four of you. First off. And then promptly knock you straight off the podcast. Luke, uh, you've got, uh, as Wilson, the woodpecker. Are you flying or are you, uh, how, what is your mode of transport here?
1488.02 1503.14 speaker2  Like we're all together now?
1495.30 1547.86 speaker1  this line and make it through with the intense, uh, bouts of jumping and dexterity and just really a lot of, um, a lot of flair as you guys jump through this area. It's almost like, uh, like a horse, uh, jumping through a hoop made of fire is essentially what everyone else sees who is in the CCCC who's in this Creek. And they all start cheering and chanting with lots of hurrahs and yippees. Essentially crowd at this point, watching you guys work your magic.
1545.38 1553.62 speaker0  its ranks or does it just chill by the Creek?
1552.34 1583.06 speaker1  more food there, right? Even though the water is in between them and they can't get it there, they see, it sees more that it can consume and therefore is distracted. And the four of you make your way to the main drag of contention. And you know that just on the other side of this drag is hotel motel, where the dopest of dopes Bean resides.
1577.14 1597.14 speaker2  As you approach this business highway, Wilson, are you in the air or are you on the ground? above, foot above the ground.
1590.42 1618.82 speaker1  Up above you see, no, it, it can't be it's, I mean it is a possum, but it's not just any possum. It looks like it's, it's your friend. It's common. And he is laying on his back. This adorable, adorable little possum that Wilson has known for years and years, just right there on the side of the road.
1616.58 1627.54 speaker2  I'm like, you do this all the time. Come on, man.
1622.26 1629.46 speaker1  You can't just come into me with your beak all like sharp and whatnots on me.
1627.54 1636.58 speaker2  Why are you playing dead over here?
1634.50 1661.30 speaker1  to y'all in the water. And it don't find me nothing to be consuming for when I be laying on the backside.
1659.06 1673.70 speaker2  He, uh, what are you doing here?
1668.02 1683.22 speaker1  Cause I heard that you joined away from the birds, people who don't like me much no more no way anyhow.
1681.78 1686.26 speaker2  water if you want.
1685.06 1701.46 speaker1  And now I'm leaving. Thanks for saying hi to all of you. Thanks for barking at me and Chip. I know what you did.
1697.54 1710.58 speaker0  You think a possum can clear whatever amount of slime is down there?
1709.70 1719.86 speaker1  Chip, what'd you do to his brother?
1717.94 1726.50 speaker0  Well, first of all, possum is delicious.
1724.42 1740.18 speaker1  Wilson, it's good to see you. Weird crew you're running with these days.
1734.82 1755.06 speaker2  The birds are not too concerned with it, so I'm trying this group out to go get them.
1752.50 1788.42 speaker1  I better go now before you seem to cry. Did Colin have something to offer us?
1785.06 1805.78 speaker2  Besides his next dope track? That was it?
1804.02 1812.74 speaker1  So you guys make it over to the other side. I'll go back and kill him if you want me to.
1810.26 1839.38 speaker2  Rusty, yeah, I was like, I'd really love to eat that possum.
1829.62 1870.74 speaker1  is not full at all, and the exterior doors of this place hold as much residue as a sink that is owned by a 19-year-old boy, or girl for that matter. 19-year-olds just don't clean their sinks very often. Basically, they're grody. It's grody doors all over the external of this place. And this is Hotel Motel, where you know that Bean is in one of these motel rooms. Oh yeah, he's the dopest golden retriever this side of the Mississippi, baby.
1867.62 1905.14 speaker2  and he can still smell like a son of a bitch, literally. There's too much. He's confused. He's like, I almost smell him, but there's too much in the air.
1898.18 1923.06 speaker1  but you do hear a bit of a warble in the air that's singing along the winds, and it's like...
1921.14 1935.30 speaker2  so he'd like to focus in on that sound.
1932.26 1964.34 speaker1  a rich, clear voice come through that says, Hello there to all. My name is Murphy, and I would like someone to let me out of this room.
1963.78 1974.02 speaker2  Oopsie.
1972.50 2008.74 speaker0  I'm the ghost of your dog. Contention Creek Critter, coalition don't leave no dog or aminal behind. Namaste. Namaste, brother.
2003.30 2025.30 speaker1  where there's a front door with an open sign that is well lit.
2024.58 2031.06 speaker2  Wait, what? If Murphy's there, I assume I'm there.
2030.34 2043.94 speaker1  It's Thomas. Thomas is a janitor. No, you're a maid. You've got fresh towels, baby.
2040.82 2111.86 speaker2  ol' Keith's name on that list, see where Bean is. And I fly towards the office thinking that the window is just open space. I don't know what you mean. What do you mean, what do you mean? What is reading? It's like human symbols that mean words. You are not making one lick of sense. Yeah, I don't follow none right here. I'll trust you again. Doonk! But there's some sort of force field.
2109.30 2159.94 speaker1  So go ahead and mark one on your... So we're doing a three check box system for damage here. That's the first box. And if you take some more damage, that's going to be major damage. That's the second box. And then if you take damage a third time, you're going to have severe damage, which is going to require a constitution rule to stay conscious. Otherwise, you're going to have to have one of your teammates help you one shot right before all this quarantine broke out.
2157.62 2196.18 speaker2  The damn fool bird don't know about glass. What the fuck just happened?
2194.58 2201.86 speaker1  Describe it deeper.
2196.18 2214.42 speaker2  Oh, he tries to put his ruffle feathers back in place. He's just like...
2211.06 2222.18 speaker0  Little tiny fat chipmunk is like, wake your damn ass up, bro. We got work to do.
2217.38 2236.34 speaker2  I get up and I stretch my wings out and flap them off to get any of the spit off. And then I fly up and perch on the little thing next to the window and peck it.
2234.82 2250.10 speaker1  right before you ran in this window. As you peck, it kind of slowly...
2245.46 2270.02 speaker0  My name's RoPo and welcome to Hotel Moto.
2269.62 2275.30 speaker2  Taylor!
2273.38 2305.78 speaker1  Thomas wants to hear your RoPo voice.
2303.94 2310.34 speaker0  RoPo seems weirdly high energy. Yeah.
2308.34 2322.66 speaker2  Have you ever seen my ass?
2322.18 2328.10 speaker0  She's right.
2326.90 2341.38 speaker2  have you seen my ass? Have you seen my ass?
2340.58 2357.94 speaker1  Pee break. Everyone leave your recording going. I'm gonna go break as well. Question is, which voice do I come back with?
2356.98 2387.46 speaker2  I'm not smoking. And I'm out of edibles right now. I'm also intermittent fasting and...
2384.98 2390.90 speaker1  That's for people who love Jesus.
2389.30 2436.42 speaker2  A dog can't love Jesus. But when I intermittent fast, I definitely feel like I've taken a mild edible during It's not the edibles. It's my fat.
2435.70 2442.58 speaker1  Your Santa voice?
2442.10 2444.02 speaker0  Yeah.
2442.58 2452.18 speaker1  Santa Claus it is. All right.
2450.50 2456.18 speaker0  Tyler starts growling at the cat.
2452.74 2464.90 speaker2  Rusty sees the cat and is startled and goes woof.
2463.06 2467.38 speaker1  Are you guys trying to intimidate her?
2466.26 2481.22 speaker2  It's just a reaction. Rusty tilts his head to the side and then when he sees the cat is no threat, his tail
2477.70 2487.86 speaker0  down, backs up a little, pause forward, backs up a little. Just trying to gaze what this cat's doing.
2486.26 2499.86 speaker2  This force field, what you call it? Oh, it's a window.
2498.42 2518.42 speaker1  That's a picture of me. I would never want to get rid of it.
2515.22 2526.10 speaker0  Looks like you haven't been hard up for food none lately.
2522.74 2529.54 speaker1  I miss our nights together every now and then.
2528.50 2536.10 speaker0  He's like, yeah, brother.
2535.06 2542.58 speaker1  Hey, Cat.
2541.86 2546.18 speaker0  There's a goo.
2544.42 2561.54 speaker2  so all the critters are meeting down at the creek. Well, keep an eye out for it.
2556.58 2565.38 speaker0  You know any animals that would be trapped or something in these parts?
2564.90 2581.14 speaker1  Bean. Oh, you almost... Oh, you do know their names. Yes, of course. Well, I'm not much for the symbols, but I believe you'll find where they are on those charts over there.
2580.66 2582.10 speaker2  Can you...
2581.14 2587.38 speaker1  Did you go to college?
2586.02 2613.78 speaker2  Critter Community College. Yeah. Intelligence. I thought... Don't you have... You said understand human, which I think means... Yeah, I can... I have... It's called a little birdie told me.
2611.22 2628.50 speaker1  When I told you that you could have special skills, you wrote down somewhere that your special skill was a little birdie told me.
2627.06 2646.26 speaker2  I think it has to be one or the other. It's I understand human stuff.
2645.54 2683.94 speaker1  Season two? Are you kidding me? That you can read and understand stuff. Okay. But if people try to talk to you, boy, you ain't gonna know what they're saying? And then we've got Murphy is on the first floor in room three.
2682.34 2696.18 speaker2  Do you guys know what that means? No.
2693.06 2710.18 speaker1  I believe it's the woodpecker that knows the symbols. Any more, Chip? I dream of you.
2708.66 2723.62 speaker2  This is a really tight game, guys. I can read the symbols on the doors here. This one's seven right here. And I fly over to room seven.
2721.54 2727.30 speaker1  And you guys go to the stairs.
2723.62 2741.22 speaker2  I go to three first then, since it's on the first floor, probably.
2740.10 2749.30 speaker3  He's our mission. He might be able to help us get this other guy. I think we should get beans.
2747.70 2760.18 speaker2  Maybe Murphy can help us. Yeah, and this first dog's on the first floor.
2759.14 2770.66 speaker0  He has stopped listening.
2769.14 2788.82 speaker2  Don't throw rocks at dogs.
2785.46 2798.82 speaker0  He can barely, he can't lift his own body weight up.
2792.90 2812.26 speaker1  where the cartoon's rocks and chips are changing size rapidly back and forth, special ability that is, or intelligence.
2809.86 2836.66 speaker2  Hearing and smelling counts as perception, right?
2830.02 2879.22 speaker1  and you see driving by slowly is someone who is looking at you, and in the shotgun seat, there's an old person with a cane, and they're shaking the cane at all of you out the window, and they're screaming something in their weird human language, convincing the person who's on the phone to do something. So does Rusty.
2873.94 2889.78 speaker0  He's real skittish, and he's already probably running for under the stairs, maybe.
2888.66 2895.70 speaker3  Yeah, exactly.
2891.46 2897.54 speaker1  Famed Tyler nemesis, Greargin.
2896.66 2913.62 speaker3  Fuck, guys, it's Greargin. We have to get out of here.
2910.58 2914.58 speaker1  He just won't die.
2913.62 2921.38 speaker2  Wow, spoilies.
2919.14 2932.66 speaker1  How are you getting into room three or seven?
2930.50 2956.26 speaker2  Look who knows what glass is all of a sudden.
2954.90 2959.94 speaker0  could perhaps go into?
2959.06 3008.90 speaker1  Of course there are. Luke, Wilson is tapping on the glass and the curtain slowly opens with a dark chocolate. I'm talking 92%. Beautiful old dog. Long hair. And it looks at you with these gorgeous knowing eyes. And it says, well, hello there, my good bird friend. I sure would like to get out of this room. Cut to Chip is running on hind legs through an air vent.
3008.34 3031.94 speaker0  Oh God. He's a warfatter. He's like he's a prepper squirrel.
3029.22 3034.18 speaker3  He's got some sick Nike's on combat.
3031.94 3038.74 speaker0  No little combat boots for a chipmunk.
3037.54 3043.46 speaker2  have been a chipmunk.
3039.54 3044.66 speaker0  Oh, like bald on top or like Tony Shalhoub.
3043.46 3067.78 speaker3  Oh, yes. All right, let's start over. I'm going to start the recording.
3067.46 3071.54 speaker2  No. I think we could do this a lot tighter.
3069.62 3099.22 speaker1  I loved every second of this. Okay. You heard me. Say it.
3098.98 3116.98 speaker2  Yes. Yep.
3116.26 3124.98 speaker0  ventilation? What happened?
3123.62 3140.42 speaker1  No, no, no, listen to me. It's round. It's really wide. But it's really wide and there's some like oil that's just like dripping from it. It's very strange.
3139.70 3184.34 speaker3  Holy shit.
3183.86 3189.62 speaker2  that means. Wait, what?
3189.22 3195.94 speaker3  Yeah.
3192.26 3224.66 speaker2  The cord's like this long, but it should, it should be fine. Some- Body. On my Animal Crossing game, I made the town theme song All Star.
3221.70 3244.66 speaker1  asked to turn the glass off. The two dogs are right behind the woodpecker and Chip the chipmunk is about to bust into a grate that is into this room.
3242.18 3260.66 speaker2  I'm like, hold on there, little fella. Help is coming in the form of a chipmunk. Please don't eat it. Although you might be tempted, he is on our side and he's going to help you get out of that room.
3258.50 3273.06 speaker1  Do you have a plan to help him get out of the room?
3271.22 3275.38 speaker2  This is a hotel motel for humans.
3274.74 3287.40 speaker1  It's a push. So it's just got like a push bar. You just have to use an Allen wrench.
3286.90 3288.74 speaker0  Murphy.
3288.18 3289.86 speaker1  Yeah.
3288.82 3299.70 speaker0  Now I'm going to come on down. Don't eat me now. Okay. I just really need you to promise me that there ain't going to be no eating of old chip tonight.
3298.74 3326.26 speaker1  Roll intelligence. I would never even consider it.
3323.70 3331.96 speaker0  the ceiling I'm coming or below? Oh yeah. Yeah. From the wall.
3331.46 3345.54 speaker3  Perfect.
3341.78 3386.66 speaker0  So I'd like to think he like does like a sick ass, like combat role. Like he like slides down the wall with one hand on the wall. So it slows him down with his little tiny, weird, creepy fingernails that rodents have. And he goes down really slow. And then as he lands, he does like a little combat role and like jumps up and he's like, He's like, now is my time.
3383.94 3402.02 speaker2  I think he would hurt my dog in a role-playing game
3401.62 3405.64 speaker0  Excited.
3405.14 3419.38 speaker3  Yeah.
3417.22 3435.96 speaker2  And I start pecking at the glass. Can you break it open?
3431.32 3516.92 speaker1  Luke Wilson, the woodpecker is standing on that little ledge that windows have. and you start seeing like shards and then sparks as you're going so slowly. So slowly through this glass, but your beak movement is so fast that these little shards sparks of glass begin flying out. And then finally you can smell the stale motel air on the other side. as a bunch of different spider web breaks on the glass. And then it into pebbles as both dogs from the outside. No. As Murphy on the inside comes bounding through the glass to the outdoors being ridden by chip. And what is chip doing on top?
3513.16 3529.48 speaker0  He's up near its neck, like holding it and trying to guide it.
3528.20 3546.92 speaker3  Rusty sniffs his ass too.
3538.60 3571.40 speaker1  So Murphy is just you've heard tell that there's an old wise wizard that lives in Hotel Motel, but you've never you've never met this Murphy, but he seems to just be here passing through or for a short time.
3568.60 3575.80 speaker0  and we're here to help all the animals we can.
3574.92 3580.84 speaker3  We got to get up there.
3576.28 3585.00 speaker2  Murphy, have you have you smelled the other dog around here, Bean?
3582.68 3595.00 speaker1  Up in room seven. And then you're all standing outside room seven. Let's do it again, boys.
3594.68 3595.96 speaker3  Same.
3595.16 3608.76 speaker2  Same game plan. Go for it, Willy.
3600.12 3621.96 speaker1  Cut to the glass shattering as Bean, a gorgeous golden retriever, jumps through the window with Chip on his back.
3621.24 3622.46 speaker3  Oh, it's high.
3621.96 3637.48 speaker2  Well. Thanks for nothing, cucks. We got to get you back to safety, Bean.
3636.20 3641.40 speaker0  Oh, hell yeah.
3641.00 3650.76 speaker1  Yeah. What should I do? Oh, he's like.
3649.88 3661.64 speaker3  Do not waste.
3659.64 3666.68 speaker2  The like Lumberjack. Mr. Peanut Butter. It's Mr. Peanut Butter's brother. Mr. Peanut Butter's brother. Gotcha.
3666.20 3701.16 speaker3  Yeah. Does someone fart? What was that? Was that Luke?
3698.20 3735.08 speaker2  and you knew it and you're a real squeaker. He sounds like Woody the Woodpecker.
3732.84 3745.56 speaker1  But I was fine in there alone. How long have you been in there? How long have you been in there?
3743.24 3754.60 speaker3  I thought Bean was the smartest voice. Most compassionate and caring.
3752.76 3762.44 speaker0  I'm so fucking smart.
3761.64 3788.04 speaker1  Jesus. Do you guys want to sniff my butt? Got you, dude. Ah, shit. Did you guys see Rusty get a rusty eye? Oh, shit. You got my stink on you now. Do you love it?
3787.56 3789.32 speaker2  That would.
3788.04 3829.24 speaker1  Do you fucking love it? Let's get out of here, bro. Thanks, Luke, for doing this to me. This piece of shit, man. I don't even know. He's my bro-lo for ro-lo, but I don't even know-lo. Just little red riding head lipstick in this motherfucker. Jack links.
3826.84 3848.84 speaker3  Yeah, let's put him back. Let's not rescue this guy.
3844.84 3886.92 speaker1  As you bust through, and the glass just pebbles down and cascades, and you're all standing there in a line from, like, tallest in the middle, and then, like, well-crafted shot design all the way through, and you're all standing in a line sideways, it's beautiful, and the glass just, like, shatters at your feet into pebbles, and then you see, like, in the foreground, the animal control van pulls up, and it is game time. Oh shit, the fuzz!
3885.48 3902.92 speaker2  No time to sniff butts. We've got the man to take on. To roll initiative, doggy style.
3897.80 3909.08 speaker1  Lettuce, tomato, roll your dice on dexterity. It's a deck structure. That's my worst.
3907.88 3926.12 speaker2  I failed.
3924.04 3941.96 speaker1  So you will all get to go first. Literally, it's... God, who should it be? It should be a pair of doofuses.
3940.76 3951.48 speaker2  Oh, that's better. Except Rip Harris.
3949.32 3957.08 speaker1  No, they're both Sewage Joe.
3955.24 3967.72 speaker2  Oh, the perverted guy. Yeah.
3966.60 3973.00 speaker3  The Todd.
3969.08 4003.00 speaker1  And Sewage Joe. And they both have taser guns. No, not guns, prods. Oh no. And they're just coming from Murphy.
4002.12 4006.84 speaker2  I love you, Luke. I love you, Justin. I love you, Joe.
4005.88 4012.04 speaker3  Fuck you, Zach.
4010.04 4023.56 speaker1  It's gotten me all shook up.
4018.60 4030.28 speaker2  I'm like, they cut down my favorite tree just because I was pecking on it in the park. Fuck these guys.
4027.16 4052.52 speaker3  They've been looking for me for days and I've been out running them, but I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, guys. They're right there.
4050.44 4079.08 speaker2  Bureaucracy, window, glass. It's a big old world. All I know is I've got it out for these fuckers and I take off and I fly towards them and I take a shit aiming for Todd's eye.
4075.72 4100.04 speaker1  And if you hit the same person twice in a round, then they'll be at a disadvantage for that second and whatever role. He's gonna try to high-five it out of the way.
4097.72 4108.20 speaker2  Oh shit, my headphones just died.
4104.68 4132.84 speaker1  In the meantime, I'd be interested to see what he rolled because I rolled a 49 on the Todd's ability to high-five. I already told them what I rolled.
4132.20 4150.76 speaker3  What did you get? You barely beat the contestant. That's so good.
4144.36 4191.00 speaker1  It literally curves around his hand like James McAvoy shooting a bullet, and it hits the Todd square in the eye, disabling him for the entire round. or basically you have the entire round yourselves before there's a reaction from Sewage Joe.
4184.92 4212.68 speaker2  We've got four dogs and a chipmunk, and they're just two stupid humans. We can round them up and take care of business. I don't have opposable thumbs.
4210.28 4243.40 speaker0  Then I can do some good work up close. so that he doesn't see the beat down that's coming to him.
4242.04 4354.12 speaker1  No, he's like fully disabled. Okay, I want to describe something terrible for you. It's okay. Um, like is it? As Chip is being flung at the Todd, who has his eyes covered in the fecal matter of Wilson the woodpecker. It's getting in his mouth because it's open because he's screaming about it and it's dripping down into his mouth and it's all over his tongue. Like he just licked ice cream, but it wasn't his bird shit. And at the exact same time, you see a masked bandit who has snuck out of its cage in the back of the animal control truck and is hitting the Todd on the opposite side of the head in the opposite direction at the exact same time as you're hitting his chin. And the two of you chip the chipmunk and Rocky the raccoon just snap the Todd's neck. As his shoulders hit the ground, so does the back of his head. Front of his shoulders, the back of his head.
4353.40 4397.96 speaker2  It's Willie. Is it Wilson? You didn't call me Willie. I have been. It fits. And I just want to try to intimidate him.
4387.72 4409.32 speaker1  Now I'm going to say Sewage Joe has a mental power of 30 because he's a flatter thing.
4405.72 4445.08 speaker2  He's got a 20 decks and a 30 strength, but he has a 70 power. So unless I fuck up the roll. I rolled a 13. There was so much opportunity.
4436.52 4457.24 speaker1  So I want you to tell me what is going through the mind of this Sewage Joe. When he looks into the eyes of Rusty.
4456.04 4497.80 speaker2  like freaks him out. And then Rusty in the lead, Bean and Murphy flanking him. Maybe Tyler's chasing his tail in the background. But these dogs with their hackles up are like slowly advancing on him. And you see the wolf in them. They're a pack of predators and they're just staring him down and growling. And he knows he needs to get the fuck out of there.
4496.68 4508.84 speaker1  Isn't it just right there?
4501.80 4517.80 speaker2  Rusty like locks eyes with him, growls and then points his snout at all the cages like in the back.
4516.84 4578.92 speaker1  I will do that. If he takes his time out here, I will head in there and I will take care of it. And then I will be right back. I have only been what I am, which is Rocky the raccoon. And I will easily take everyone and get them out of there if you just have him stand there real quick. Yes, of course. And so he, this little raccoon runs into the back of the animal control van. And soon there's a parade of animals, three long. It's the raccoon that just went in there, a fox, a little red fox. And there is a goat. So we're going to get you guys back onto the Creek. Wait. Yeah.
4577.72 4603.88 speaker2  Cause they cut my tree down. Why?
4601.64 4610.84 speaker1  I want to pick his eyeballs.
4609.80 4654.04 speaker2  But I'm not sewage Joe. reiterate that animal control has nothing to do with cutting down trees in the park. Maybe the utility company, or perhaps even just a local, you know, tree service. Uh, that tree might've been rotted, might've been about to fall. I just don't think this is the guy who cut down.
4652.04 4664.44 speaker0  We're, we got a mission to complete here.
4663.64 4685.08 speaker2  off the comments. I want to land on his head and peck his eyeballs out. I only have one box check. Yes.
4684.68 4696.52 speaker1  Okay. Take your second damage, you motherfucker, because you definitely just flew. Wait, roll intelligence for the sake of playing. 21 on a 20.
4695.24 4703.08 speaker2  He knows what class is now.
4702.04 4726.68 speaker1  That is so perfect. You slam into the glass of the animal control van and he looks out and you guys make direct eye contact as he's driving away. And let me tell you something Wilson, he looks scared.
4721.48 4738.92 speaker2  Can I at least crack his window to make his day inconvenient other than his dead friend?
4736.04 4756.04 speaker1  The only two things that exist in this man's life.
4755.32 4794.44 speaker2  I'm content. Okay, let's get back to the creek, I guess. Oh, thanks.
4792.92 4800.28 speaker1  conga line butt sniffing. Oh, yeah.
4795.96 4829.00 speaker2  Rusty says to the chipmunk and the woodpecker, you guys want to get in on this? No. I go and perch on the goats and horns and what's up, kid?
4827.48 4856.04 speaker3  Well, of course. The squirrel, he sent us and we're supposed to bring it back to the creek.
4855.24 4868.36 speaker1  the parking lot.
4867.72 4887.48 speaker0  Yeah. Now that we've rehearsed it.
4882.52 4893.24 speaker2  found a new favorite tree and never left it because he's deathly afraid that there are windows in the sky now.
4892.60 4912.04 speaker1  He's content. And obviously Murphy will be the last.
4910.60 4919.64 speaker3  Yes, be careful, motherfucker.
4916.52 4943.64 speaker1  We've got Stallone, the old gray squirrel. And it says Stallone carried his torch well, but not for long as he was gotten on the very next run, laying down his life for others on a run to get nuts. See, that's why he was first.
4941.72 4946.12 speaker0  Making way for a new leader.
4945.16 4958.12 speaker1  Chip Montgomery.
4955.56 4962.68 speaker0  And now he, after the successful mission, he's...
4958.84 4966.20 speaker2  You're, you're questioning whether a chipmunk can be a leader after a squirrel.
4965.72 5018.12 speaker1  Wow. But a chipmunk? Thomas, do you have a good one? Oh, uh, Common. Common died, uh, on the side of the road, dot, dot, dot. Or did he? You know, something of that nature. And then, uh, the dead possum picture up on the screen winks at you with a little star that goes... desk and then it says, uh, RoPo found out what the black goo was the hard way. No.
5013.88 5027.80 speaker3  The freeze frame on Tyler is him kind of veering away from the group. And, uh, he got distracted and saw a snake in the grass and started following it.
5026.92 5047.56 speaker0  I don't like that.
5039.48 5050.04 speaker1  Rocky made a, made a good friend and then had to tragically watch him die slowly from chocolate poisoning.
5048.84 5071.32 speaker2  Did Rocky give it to him? I don't think animals know what they can't eat because then they wouldn't eat it.
5066.60 5082.28 speaker0  despite his age, but no one would accept him because he's an old fat asshole.
5080.04 5132.44 speaker1  leader of the Contention. That was the end. Did you guys like that?
5131.32 5132.44 speaker4  No, it was fun. Nobody home.
