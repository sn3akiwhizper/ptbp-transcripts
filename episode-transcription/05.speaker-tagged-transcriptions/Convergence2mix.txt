0.00 83.52 speaker0  Hey, what's up? It's Zach. I just want to pop in here up top to make a quick announcement. It's getting really cold outside. We here at PTBP feel super grateful to not only have a warm place to sleep at night, but also the means to help those who don't. So we're going to take the money from all new and upgrading Patreon supporters throughout the month of November. We're going to double it and we're going to buy blankets and sleeping bags for folks in Springfield who need them. So one more time for the people super focused on washing dishes or eating pussy or both, if you join our Patreon or upgrade your support any time in the month of November, we are going to take all that new and upgraded money, we're going to double it, and then we're going to use that money to purchase blankets and sleeping bags for people in our area who need some help staying warm this winter. This David Winters. Whatever, here's Wolf.
75.04 427.12 speaker1  And despite all my rage, I somehow wound up in the 1990s. What the flippin' fuck is going on with Wolf, and this week's is presented by Stephen Lee from Brampton, Ontario, Canada, who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pog. He writes, hello PTBP crew. and I began to listen. Listening motivated me enough to get a one-shot started with my gaming group. Keep up the great work, and I'd like to shout out my own agents, Hannah, Sarah, Well, damn. Hello, Stephen Lee. I'm happy that whatever this show is inspired you to do something. You only have one shot in this life, unlike me, and I'm glad you are shooting that one shot to run a one-shot with a gaming group. I'm glad you're doing whatever the hell it is you're doing, and I hope you're loving doing it. Ta-ta for now. Well, now, if you want to write up something for your dimension hopping wolf to hell, it's really quite simple. Just with an email to pretendingpod at gmail.com. Pretending Pod. Pretending Pod. Pretending Pod. If you can't support the show by telling your friends that you're a heckin' weirdo, throw us some bones on Patreon in exchange for a slop trough full of 24 episodes. Like that piece of shit Zack said at the top of the show, we're out here slingin' extra tent to purchase tents and sleeping bags for folks who need them. It's cold out there, but Wolf's got a warm heart. doing right now. Raise your snout to the sky like the animal you are, and shout these three words were sent to Groversville, Tennessee, the bud end of regional jokes due to the reported UFO sightings in the area. What brought them there, however, was neither unidentified nor flying. A recent high school graduate named Billy Ray Spivey smashed a hole in his dad's chest before going on a Skies. Watch the Skies? More like watch these guys keep interviewing this cool ass mom for the next
417.44 460.40 speaker0  David Winters. David Winters is here, everyone, to run us through a game of Delta Green. Yes, No, I was shooting for a single episode appearance, but it seems as though I bit off more than I could chew, and I am now contractually obligated to stay.
458.88 474.40 speaker3  He's going to have to break to those guys.
469.60 477.84 speaker0  your phone's operating system, and you're just like, agree, agree, agree. How bad could this be?
474.40 502.00 speaker3  That's what we actually slipped it into, was your latest Samsung terms of service. Actually, I bet you are an Apple guy. Am I correct? Yes.
495.76 532.42 speaker0  Not the newest one, but one that's better than mine currently that will actually open up when I click an app because there for a while, David, I was clicking an app, and then it would just close because my phone didn't work anymore because it was 10 years old. Yeah, as an iPhone original series. I had the OG iPhone. Wow. That was from 2007. Yep. A decade ago.
531.92 576.40 speaker3  30 more. Josh, respect. Jesus. It's so uncomfortable the first time. You know what was uncomfortable? As as a nation, watching those people leap to their deaths. Can we take 30 fucking seconds, Joe? No, sir.
574.56 588.48 speaker0  here with David Winters. We feel like we know you.
586.72 592.88 speaker3  We're comfortable with you, David.
592.00 610.80 speaker0  You don't even know. All right, let's go into this 18-year-old girl's room.
610.00 639.84 speaker3  Yes, yes, yes. We've got a lot of people we need to talk to. Bradley Allen has potentially been at work missing this whole time, Was the town hall and the sheriff's office all kind of together?
636.64 666.48 speaker0  Scott Adams, watch the skies with an email address. Watch the skies at AOL. Watch. Yes. He's probably still working through his 20 free hours from his last three and a half inch floppy disk that he just received. Those were fun in the early 90s. All the CDs and floppy disks is where they try to get you hooked. AOL mailers. You're like, hey, you can get 20 hours of internet a month for $15.
664.00 678.08 speaker3  Now, did you look more closely at the business card?
673.84 684.00 speaker0  Someone has to have a Room Raider style blacklight flashlight on their character sheet, right?
682.80 725.68 speaker3  He was wearing cargo pants. We didn't have time to send you the list of things in Harlan's pants, but I reviewed it beforehand. That was one of the things. We do need to think like 1992, so we should probably also check for prints. Rest in peace. The show? The show.
724.48 730.88 speaker0  30 seconds of silence.
729.12 744.72 speaker3  Further look at the business card. Hey, me too. Go for it.
743.52 787.44 speaker0  49! but that's a weird thing to dust for on a business card. However, also with your forensic skill, you flip the business card over Otherwise, you wouldn't have seen that. I'm looking at it. How many is a phone number? I bet it's Scott Adams. We'll have to get to a phone.
784.00 804.56 speaker3  I bet there's one near the computer at Bradley's office. Hey, do you think this is famed creator of Dilbert, Scott Adams? That's the assumption I was operating under. I bet it is.
802.48 815.68 speaker0  I don't read the newspaper. And not even the funnies?
811.84 869.60 speaker3  you know, our main DAA headquarters in the city that that is located in. Whatever field office we're currently based out of, which is uh... I'll show you when we get back there. It's pretty funny. And I show her the business card.
867.68 886.56 speaker0  A weird Venn diagram of the two. How'd you know? That just a lucky guess.
885.28 919.20 speaker3  Dogworth flies a UFO. you know, exploring the theoretical limits of human capability, perhaps through surgical enhancements?
914.88 942.64 speaker0  and she has discussed that, but surgical enhancements less so. Where did she want to go? Prestigious. I agree.
941.92 949.28 speaker3  Illustration?
947.60 968.16 speaker0  It's all coming together. The far side? The rapper? Who isn't?
964.96 978.88 speaker3  Oh no, I mean, I've got just as many far sides as I do Dilberts. I can't wait to get you back to Memphis.
978.40 999.52 speaker0  Yep.
996.80 1009.60 speaker3  That doesn't mean you're considered a suspect at this time. Person of interest. Perhaps. Okay.
1007.60 1013.68 speaker2  Tell me if she's under the influence of anything.
1011.44 1040.96 speaker0  You can roll medicine or human.
1040.16 1052.64 speaker3  You can go for it.
1048.96 1069.68 speaker0  increased blood pressure, rapid heart rate, raised temperature, and shallow breathing of which is demonstrating all of them with your critical failure. How do you know David Winters? Sorry, honey.
1068.24 1074.56 speaker3  Micro doses, PCP.
1073.12 1089.92 speaker2  I'm like whispering to one of them. You'd see it, right? You see all those signs, right?
1083.36 1101.20 speaker3  Yeah, we're, it is classic signs of PCP, but, uh, there does seem to just be something strange in her eyes. Uh, something that's not there. Why don't I take a crack at this? I rolled a, uh, a 38 on a 60.
1100.40 1120.40 speaker0  Contrary. It's not.
1118.32 1126.48 speaker3  of PCP on your arm.
1120.40 1133.52 speaker0  I have so many PCP tattoos that show what PCP looks like. Do you have any ICP tattoos?
1127.92 1138.32 speaker3  Well, you have the cartoon of Dogbert doing PCP and demonstrating all the effects.
1137.76 1152.24 speaker0  Crystal. Crystal. anything in her eyes that looked unnatural as I'm trying to make my determinations, but I failed miserably.
1151.20 1163.28 speaker3  I have 10 unnatural.
1162.40 1168.74 speaker0  If you don't die first. Fair enough.
1165.78 1178.74 speaker3  We've seen her far in the future shitting on a toilet with her smartphone.
1177.54 1185.06 speaker0  So you're on notice sec.
1183.54 1193.62 speaker3  I don't think she's on. I can't tell that she, do you think she's on drugs? Yeah.
1190.98 1197.38 speaker0  I think she's just really fucking weird. Yeah.
1195.78 1210.82 speaker3  It makes me very uncomfortable. Yeah.
1210.50 1223.14 speaker0  ma'am.
1220.50 1260.90 speaker3  You guys are, you're down with Intel, right? Absolutely. Okay. Um, ma'am, have you come under the influence of anything? He kind of loves his voice and gets like a little closer. Spooky. I've been in about a year. There's a show like an exactly this, this time next year.
1260.66 1265.30 speaker0  Wow.
1263.78 1278.98 speaker3  They should have called it the end files. Anyway, I saw that in my partner's eyes one time. That's how I know.
1277.54 1280.42 speaker0  So we need to get the fuck out. Let's go talk to Bradley.
1279.94 1281.62 speaker3  Time to leave.
1281.14 1287.22 speaker0  Look at that. Take care. Cool. Yeah.
1282.98 1294.98 speaker3  Can we do like a little quick search of the rest of the house as we go out? Sure.
1294.18 1298.74 speaker0  Pass.
1297.54 1304.26 speaker2  A 79 on a 70.
1300.66 1316.98 speaker3  They tumbled down the stairs, but we noticed behind a picture frame.
1316.10 1350.58 speaker0  That's what I was. I was looking for there. Otherwise you would have found, uh, several bodies. The house is pristine. You see clearly her husband lives there as well. Much like the daughter, their rooms are spotless. It seems as though this lady just walks around the house, cleans all day and thinks about Dilbert cartoons. And that's pretty much it.
1350.34 1357.62 speaker3  Wow. That's really sad, man. He's a by the book guy.
1357.06 1367.70 speaker2  City hall. Do we want to do? It's about 10 o'clock now.
1367.14 1386.02 speaker0  Questioning. You can never spend less in game time than you spend in real life doing something.
1384.98 1409.62 speaker3  According to her. And she seems super trustworthy. fuzz knows and maybe get kind of a more bird's eye view of the town from him. I agree with that. We don't need to let him know that we need to use the internet to look this shit up.
1407.86 1472.82 speaker0  Again, center of town is the town hall. Just to the side is the joint sheriff's office, ambulance, single ambulance stand and volunteer fire department. You knock on the door and conveniently the sheriff, even though it's 10 o'clock at night, is still working. And he greets you. Thank you for finally making it. Sheriff Dan Oakley. How goes it? Is she taller than him too? No, he's pretty tall. He's tall, but fat with gray hair, solid gray mustache hugging his upper lip. He looks kind of like a poor man's cliff from Cheers. As he goes to meet her for a, for a hand shake, she like dodges it and then goes for a hug where she puts her arms around his, like right above his belt. Close to your woodpecker.
1471.54 1475.54 speaker3  I'm Cindy Woodpecker.
1474.82 1482.10 speaker0  Nice to meet you.
1479.14 1492.66 speaker3  I'm agent Dodine and this is my partner. Agent Cindy Woodpecker, DEA. These are our associates on this current task force.
1491.86 1506.18 speaker0  Nice to meet you all. I don't want to be around.
1505.22 1508.10 speaker3  Which would you prefer?
1507.54 1512.42 speaker2  Let it go.
1508.90 1523.06 speaker3  No, as she lets go of the Sheriff, you see that, like, Jodine has had a very intense grasp on like her belt, like trying to like pull her away this whole time.
1522.42 1573.78 speaker0  Yes. Okay, so you successfully pull her back and he's, I'm glad you made it in here. Welcome to my town. Been Sheriff here for years and it's not too often we get city folk in here. What do you want to know? What can I help you with? Can you tell me how to get to Sesame Street? Sunny days. Ah, nice. Okay, sick. sort of influence. Doesn't seem to be drugs from my personal understanding of the situation, but she is out of it for real. And she has not seen her daughter who was the boyfriend in forever. The daughter was the boyfriend? Yeah, three weeks. Yeah.
1573.22 1600.10 speaker3  in this town? Not that I'm aware of. might cut to the quick here. Has anything been going wrong in your town lately or do you feel like things are just fine?
1599.62 1604.18 speaker0  No, sir.
1602.74 1612.50 speaker3  It's just something we have to ask. It's part of a forum.
1611.14 1634.02 speaker0  There are no drugs here. Let's just put it that way. he's going to ignore me, which is what I was going for. I'd like to be looking for cuts, small incisions on his skin 22.
1633.14 1639.78 speaker3  Hell yes.
1637.22 1667.62 speaker0  that last time to see those tiny little pricks. He does not have them. But you know all about that.
1665.86 1705.30 speaker3  The super meth that he was on. Yeah, it's real shame. Yeah, real shame. And the devil. You know, them kids. The combination of the two is really horrible. DND. It gets them all riled up. Always at work. It's a light flock. Let's put it that way.
1704.74 1714.50 speaker0  Shame. One went out of business. To the extent churches are businesses.
1713.38 1718.50 speaker3  And it's America. Yeah.
1716.34 1724.10 speaker0  Is that why you're asking these very specific church questions? Maybe if we're in town long enough.
1720.02 1744.50 speaker3  The next question I actually want to know is, have you seen Bradley Allen recently? The Alder? Have you seen him coming and going from work in the past few days or even weeks? What's he like? What can you tell us about him? Smart man.
1740.82 1778.34 speaker0  He was educated in the big city. Is he from around here? Born and bred. But I think this drug stuff is nonsense. It would never happen under my watch.
1773.70 1792.50 speaker3  I've seen good, upstanding Christian children just go astray. And so you told me your flock was diminishing and we're with the DEA. It gets, you wouldn't believe what we see. Super meth for one. But we're basically healers.
1789.94 1807.54 speaker0  We're going to come in and we're going to take care of it. And you're going to look like a hero and it'll be great. And that is you're here investigating the super meth. Why are you looking for missing people?
1806.74 1864.98 speaker3  Spivvy? How do folks say that around here? Spivvy. Spivvy. You said that with perhaps a hint of disdain. Is that a family that's, that causes some, some ruckus? Occasionally. Occasionally. super meth to your town and he might've spread it around to some of his friends. and people go missing. And so that's kind of the connection of, you know, every thread we can kind of pull on. And we dropped by her mama's house who said that she ain't seen her in about three weeks. So that got us, that was just got us wondering. I'm, I'm sure she's going to be fine.
1859.22 1874.58 speaker0  I wouldn't, I'll fill out a report, but kids around here, very mature.
1870.50 1883.22 speaker2  where, where do they, where do those kids congregate, especially the seniors in town?
1879.70 1903.70 speaker0  It's the only place in town with, with booze license. We keep all the riffraff there. The younger ones, I know what those kids do. They have their siblings buy them beer at the county bunker. And then they take it down to the reservoir and hang at the reservoir.
1899.70 1910.82 speaker2  Is it, is it five or six kids or is it 20 or 30 kids?
1908.74 1923.06 speaker0  It's a, it is a Thursday night. Thirsty Thursday. Thirsty Thursday.
1919.22 1941.54 speaker3  Maybe we go down there and talk to them after we talk to Mr. Allen. If he's in there. Eight. Name all of them.
1940.74 1946.82 speaker0  Oh, that makes sense. Yeah. Richest man in town.
1946.26 1956.98 speaker3  Yes, sir. Oh yeah.
1956.10 1988.50 speaker0  The mega deuce. anything to eat nor are you sleeping. except the 24 seven mega deuce. That's very handy.
1987.22 1998.44 speaker3  Should we go talk to Bradley? Well, I mean, so sheriff is the city hall open right now. Would anybody be there?
1997.94 2014.42 speaker0  Probably. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go check it out. Yeah, let's go. Give me some.
2013.54 2018.90 speaker3  And they don't exist. Cliff bars exist.
2015.94 2022.10 speaker0  Oh, she pulls out four bags of trail mix.
2020.34 2028.50 speaker3  Oh, her home at her trail mix is good. There's lots of M and M's.
2027.94 2037.78 speaker0  Yeah. I think those are boosted at the time. Man, those things make a mess, huh? Yeah, they're good though.
2035.78 2040.18 speaker3  They are really tasty before we leave.
2038.34 2050.58 speaker2  Harlan wants to ask the Sheriff.
2049.62 2068.02 speaker0  That troublemaker. Yes. I looking at a UFO nonsense. One of those idiots. What does he have to do with the drugs? Oh, nothing. I checked.
2066.74 2076.98 speaker3  That is disappointing. We're just fans.
2074.42 2105.06 speaker0  Wait, we don't have any. That is nonsense. Bunch of poppycock. He said it again.
2103.22 2133.54 speaker3  Uh, why are you asking? Okay. for tourist draw around here was kind of the UFO. Yeah.
2132.90 2150.34 speaker0  Sure. Sure. Yes. Uh, yes, we are the butt end of jokes all across the country. They say those idiots in Grover's Ville, they say they're such Muppets. They named a Muppet after him. That's what they say about us.
2149.14 2156.90 speaker3  So I understand. Oh, sorry. Rolfsburg. Yeah.
2155.62 2165.46 speaker0  I'm from Elmo town. So I also completely I'm from big birding 10 say one, Joe.
2164.82 2171.14 speaker2  Snuffle up.
2170.74 2189.30 speaker3  Yeah. We don't think this is a mother. Thank you. Sounds like you got your head on straight about all this, but why? What again? Yes, sir. What's the origin? Why did it start? Was there like a Roswell crash siding sort of precipitating incident or
2184.26 2200.90 speaker0  people say they see stuff in the skies and that kind of nonsense. Never seen it myself. Think it's a bunch of hooey. This town's fine. I am a great sheriff to be clear. I believe that. I believe that. Sheriff. Yeah.
2200.50 2221.16 speaker3  You know what? You just call us. Yeah. Wow. You might think of anything you think of. You can call the DAA. Sorry.
2219.08 2225.24 speaker0  It's a phone in your car.
2224.12 2261.56 speaker3  Isn't that cool? That's so cool, right? You can, uh, beat me too. Yeah. Sheriff. Let's do try to keep things professional. We are federal agents. I'm sorry. That man's beeper channel is a critical piece of national security. Can't be filling it up with security with boobs. Beeper number is, uh, actually, yeah, it's eight zero zero eight one three five.
2256.36 2276.60 speaker0  Wooda Baker goes for the high five and then turns her back and starts walking next door. Wait, let's go to the last question with Joe.
2274.84 2282.36 speaker2  Is there something that's keeping you tonight?
2279.64 2287.24 speaker0  Is it, uh, since when is it bad to love your job?
2283.88 2292.20 speaker2  I'm asking if there's something on your desk that's taking a little extra time.
2291.00 2295.00 speaker0  You know, exactly.
2293.48 2299.88 speaker3  But, uh, what are you working on tonight? What's your job tonight?
2299.16 2312.76 speaker0  I have a staff.
2311.32 2359.40 speaker3  No, they're severely understaffed. Have all your deputies, have all your deputies been coming in and showing up to work and everything? Just making sure. Bye. She don't trust nobody though. That's just her way. Hey, you have a pleasant Eden Sheriff. Thank you Sheriff. Thank you.
2351.48 2364.84 speaker0  As you leave, he calls out, uh, if you, if you go to the mega deuce, tell him the Sheriff Oh yeah, we'll do.
2364.04 2369.32 speaker3  One more question.
2367.96 2377.00 speaker2  You reeled him back in.
2376.52 2388.44 speaker3  Yeah. Yes sir.
2386.60 2419.64 speaker0  Just trying to help Mr. Cervantes out. Can I, he meant that? Sure. It doesn't seem like he's misleading you. He's suggesting you go to like a 24 hour diner and restaurant versus going to a bar with presumably like microwave chicken fingers and stuff. It's actually probably just good advice as far as quality food goes.
2417.56 2432.36 speaker3  Harlan, I've looked into his soul. So I believe we should head on a, well, wait, I guess we're going to hit up the city hall first.
2431.36 2452.20 speaker0  Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. We're playing like a side scroller.
2451.56 2461.88 speaker3  All in a line.
2458.12 2496.20 speaker0  It's a nicer, more regal looking building. Clearly the nicest building in town. It's up almost a flight of stairs outside to get kind of in the front. And there's like a large grand foyer as you get in with a reception desk up front. And it happens to be staffed by a young woman right now. Right.
2494.44 2497.96 speaker3  No. Hey, could it be?
2497.00 2501.88 speaker2  That would be convenient.
2501.32 2503.00 speaker0  Hot damn.
2501.88 2503.88 speaker2  Cracked the cakes.
2503.00 2511.00 speaker0  Her mom was right.
2510.44 2522.60 speaker3  Hi ma'am. Hello. We're agents. Could you point us to Mr. Bradley Allen's office? Ah, the alderman. That's the one.
2521.64 2540.20 speaker0  He's in his office? Yeah, he's busy right now. I'll get him for you if you can just hang here. Can I interest?
2537.08 2552.76 speaker3  Real quick, how many of the aldermen are working tonight? Just a couple of them, I think. Is it typical for them to, you know, burn that old midnight oil? It's tax season.
2552.20 2562.28 speaker0  And death. Death and aldermen. Go ahead. I'll go get him.
2561.56 2565.08 speaker3  Thank you.
2564.68 2567.88 speaker0  Yes. Yes ma'am.
2567.40 2575.88 speaker3  Two. Wow. Just go get the alderman, please.
2573.96 2580.68 speaker0  If you need anything, the bathroom's right behind you. Thank you.
2579.56 2588.12 speaker3  I took a shit, dude. Dude, in real Delta Green, are you supposed to take shits?
2586.52 2600.20 speaker0  I took a shit right before the meeting. You have to be careful because you might get disorders related to, like, pooping your pants and stuff.
2595.16 2626.30 speaker3  Yeah, no, Luke had that through all, like, a year and a half of our first campaign. So we got a lot of shit jokes. Yeah.
2624.86 2633.82 speaker0  It's fine if it's just that. I'm not pushing.
2631.90 2639.26 speaker2  kind of getting a lay of the building.
2636.54 2644.30 speaker0  Cindy is putting on her cardigan and cheaters.
2642.62 2652.38 speaker2  It's a 35 on a 50.
2648.54 2694.46 speaker0  some sort of offices upstairs, looking down the longer hallways to the left or right. They're totally dark. There's no movement or anything else. It's probably much busier during the day than it is right now. In fact, the lights are largely off. It's pretty dimly lit, actually, inside. They're conserving those taxpayer dollars. With that search role, you go through her desk, you find her purse, you find standard stuff in there. ID, lipstick, mirror, no cell phone yet, and her name is Jennifer Kahn. You also see that on her desk, on her name tag. K-H-A-N.
2693.50 2723.02 speaker3  Maybe her last name?
2718.22 2744.70 speaker0  So after a couple minutes, she comes back, assuming neither of you took that long in the bathroom, you can still be in the bathroom finishing your business if you really want to when she comes back, but she comes back with an alder man dressed neatly in a suit and he introduces himself.
2742.94 2755.18 speaker3  Oh, freshly washed. It's not, I didn't pee on my hand. He did though, but he didn't say that. He just thinks it. Okay, good.
2754.62 2760.86 speaker0  It's clean. Roll me a persuade.
2760.22 2768.72 speaker3  I got a three.
2768.22 2785.74 speaker0  I'm sorry.
2783.74 2801.02 speaker3  You guys need to get some different soap in there. Asparagus soap is very odd choice, very odd choice. And then I just kind of fall back a little bit and just look down at my shoes.
2798.22 2809.58 speaker0  Well, what can I help the other three of you with?
2803.82 2818.38 speaker3  We've got some questions for you regarding, well, frankly, your daughter and her friend, Billy race baby. Oh, would you, is there some more private? We can talk.
2816.22 2825.18 speaker0  Let's grab one of these side offices right here.
2822.54 2871.66 speaker3  or involved in any criminal activity. Is she okay? We have some questions for you, sir. Can we, can we go into another room? Uh, yes. One question per room. Let's try out a different one. No, we don't have one of those rooms. Oh shoot. Well, could you tell us anyway?
2869.82 2877.50 speaker0  Well, I appreciate your honesty.
2874.78 2878.30 speaker3  humant and we'll see what we get.
2877.50 2910.62 speaker0  I'd rather not. and take everything I say on face as the truth. Oh sure, that's what we meant by your office. Let's go. Yeah.
2909.98 2911.90 speaker3  Mm-hmm.
2911.26 2929.42 speaker0  I'm very busy. I have to go. Yeah, we'll go with you. Face guy.
2928.46 2944.06 speaker3  I'm just joshing. I'm joshing. That's good. What kind of drugs is your wife on?
2941.34 2951.10 speaker0  We're God-fearing people in this town. Okay.
2948.54 2959.02 speaker3  So you haven't seen your daughter in like three weeks. And that's not normal, but you're fine with it. She's an independent girl.
2957.58 2976.54 speaker0  I've been busy at work. It isn't taxi. Same in our County. It is 14 success.
2975.98 2978.78 speaker3  What are we? Okay.
2978.30 2986.38 speaker2  Human.
2985.42 3015.90 speaker3  That's pretty bad. Leave him alone. It all makes sense. Now she's an adult. She can do what she wants.
3010.06 3042.30 speaker0  As far as his empathy goes similar to his wife where he is saying it doesn't bother him. It doesn't seem like it bothers him, but he also doesn't seem like he's some like psychopathic serial killer either. So it's somewhere kind of in between that golf. There's something a little not there. It's like Stepfordy. Yeah. No. Okay. This the sheriff was weird too. But a little bit. Yeah.
3038.86 3056.06 speaker3  What does what's going on in your town bother you or is anything in your town bothering you? Wasn't he like, are you saying I'm a bad sheriff? Yeah.
3050.46 3076.38 speaker0  Like he got defensive in an attempt to cover up the fact that he doesn't truly believe that anything is wrong. We're like, Hey, excuse me.
3075.90 3080.54 speaker3  Spivvy?
3079.42 3088.62 speaker0  She's going places. Boy's just dragging her down. But that's why you people were here. Because of him and those drugs. That's what the sheriff said. Yeah.
3087.74 3091.02 speaker2  He is a brick.
3088.62 3096.62 speaker0  He's like a brick of this new super meth.
3095.90 3113.82 speaker3  Oh, you're right. Here's the deal, Alderman. You say she was hanging out with a boy that you knew was trouble. He's trouble. You say she's going places, though. Ohio State University. The Ohio State University.
3112.54 3121.98 speaker0  I put in a good word.
3120.62 3146.14 speaker3  That's pretty similar to UFO. And that's just a little coincidence I noted. But going on, don't you think it's odd that a boy you do not enjoy, let's put it that You think he's trouble. You say she's going places. Yep. And she's in fact been places unknown for the past three weeks. What are you suggesting? Why aren't you worried about that?
3143.66 3174.38 speaker0  Well, that spivvy boy, he's in custody, right? He's going to stay away from my girl. Well, you know. You can't just conduct a normal drug investigation. You got to ask the nonsense alien questions, just like every reporter.
3169.82 3207.34 speaker3  If you would have ever seen this meth, you would say it's otherworldly. Ah, nice. I want to know if this anger about the UFOs, which the sheriff also demonstrated. Is that legitimate, like hometown pride, like we're the butt of all these jokes? Or is that defensive? Oh, yes.
3203.18 3231.42 speaker0  With your 18, you know that they're definitely the butt end of the jokes based on your interaction with the sheriff as well as him. You know, people in authority here don't like their town being looked at as this kind of laughing stock. That makes sense. It's unclear if he's actively hiding anything, but he's definitely defensive about it. Gotcha. But it is just like the sheriff.
3227.50 3236.14 speaker3  And as the town leader, he seems to have a really good reason to feel that way. As far as you know, that's it.
3235.74 3245.34 speaker0  Hey, man.
3243.18 3267.98 speaker3  Do you have any tattoos? Or maybe you could show us your arm or your leg. Oh, look, I got tattoos. This one is Japanese for diligence. I do. Oh, what?
3263.26 3277.66 speaker0  So he takes off his suit jacket that starts rolling up his sleeve like he's going to give blood. And you see right on the inside of his right forearm. He's got one of those sweet infinity sign tattoos.
3274.94 3289.10 speaker3  Nice upon closer inspection. We're all just digging our eyes. Woodabaga just grabs his arm and brings it up to all of our eyes.
3287.42 3310.70 speaker4  I pass with a 40 on a seven. I got another 99.
3306.86 3335.66 speaker0  So the first time on Billy Ray, you definitively saw marks. And then it was Nancy, the mom. Yes. Same with the sheriff. He definitively does not have the same kind of muscle punctures.
3332.94 3362.06 speaker3  And then we've been working on this task force with Tan here. So they've all been just razzing me about, you know, when are you going to get yours? When do you get yours? And I'm like, it's 1992. We're like 20 years away from that being really socially acceptable. Just, you know, in a professional job, maybe even 30. It's just been on our minds lately. I hope you like it. Yeah. What's it mean? It means infinity.
3361.66 3372.78 speaker0  Nice. Oh, that happens sometimes, you know.
3370.62 3380.54 speaker3  Maybe we could go use your computer real quick. Thank you.
3378.62 3415.90 speaker0  He can crack it open for you. There's not really such a thing as cyber security at this point. There's not even a login really to get on. And he fires up the 28-8 modem on that computer and you hear that sweet, sweet sound of
3414.94 3423.26 speaker3  And I was like, no, it's fine. Yeah. It's really confusing. Sorry.
3419.58 3433.18 speaker0  Player Thomas, character Joe, you said you had an AOL account?
3432.30 3440.06 speaker3  Joe Dean. Okay, great.
3439.82 3442.86 speaker0  Okay.
3441.82 3493.02 speaker3  Who's it from? Your AOL. Sounds role-play appropriate. He's probably the only reason I have an internet, like an AOL account right now. Like last Thanksgiving, he was like, yeah, personal computer. The, you know, the nerds came in, wired up my home. I've got, uh, I've got access to the whole world right now, baby. And it's just a shitty AOL chat room. Agent would have begun. Oh yeah, sorry.
3491.98 3499.58 speaker4  Bring that up.
3496.46 3510.86 speaker3  Do you guys remember any, uh, nineties joke chain emails? my mom used to fucking love those all. This is like a little bit before that for sure.
3509.18 3512.22 speaker0  you're going to have bad luck kind of thing. Exactly. Yeah.
3511.90 3537.50 speaker3  Yeah. It's that. doesn't sink a really viable candidate. I hope this country doesn't hate women enough.
3536.30 3543.58 speaker4  Watch the skies. Orange piece of shit. AOL.com.
3542.86 3581.18 speaker3  Well, what do you do? Types in the email address, subject line, D E. Hey. Curious, uh, re UFOs. Wanted to ask you some cues.
3578.62 3585.10 speaker2  Cause I don't know if we're going to get access to the email again.
3582.30 3590.94 speaker3  I was like, oh, I've been wondering about that the whole time. Like this, how do we get a computer again?
3590.70 3596.78 speaker4  Yeah.
3593.50 3601.82 speaker3  Sincerely, John Dean, federal agent. Aggressive. I want him to think I might know things.
3599.90 3607.58 speaker4  A with the circle around it.
3605.74 3611.18 speaker3  It's called an apostrophe. I think I believe that's correct.
3610.54 3621.26 speaker0  Yep. You've got mail. Ooh. Auto reply.
3619.42 3633.90 speaker3  Did you get two messages perhaps? Oh, I did. Look, the Dilbert guy messaged us back. You. Yes.
3630.70 3662.62 speaker0  So auto reply, uh, read D E Hey. Investigating what's happening in Grover's Ville. I will get back to you at my earliest convenience. Signed Scott Adams, not the creator of Dilbert. And he gives a address in Knoxville.
3660.86 3686.22 speaker3  There is in fact a telephone in this office. Are you going to call that address? No, I'm going to call the number that was on the back of the card. Uh, hold on, hold on, hold on. roughly 10 minutes, uh, for an urgent federal business. Uh, we're about to call our boss. We need to commandeer your phone. Could you please step outside?
3685.18 3693.42 speaker4  You're escorting him out? Yeah. We just started escorting him out. But yeah, it's just only for a little bit.
3692.70 3702.46 speaker3  You got busy. Remember you said you had to get back to work, right? Yeah. 10 minutes. Probably got to talk to him.
3701.74 3714.14 speaker0  I'll wait. You know, do you need to ask me any more questions or should I just go back to work? Now you can fuck off. Thanks. Except for she realizes she's wearing the cardigan.
3712.94 3721.74 speaker4  She's like, Oh, wrong voice. Ah, dammit. Okay.
3718.54 3750.38 speaker0  He goes upstairs back doing whatever he's doing upstairs with taxes. And you're gonna make that phone call? Yes. Now I need that trademarked ring that you guys do. Oh, so well. We'll put it in.
3749.02 3780.54 speaker3  I don't think I've ever actually heard this. I'll do it in post Taylor. Really? Thomas doesn't listen to the show. It's one of my favorite parts.
3779.10 3781.18 speaker0  Not ringing like a normal phone.
3780.54 3782.62 speaker3  Listen to this.
3781.74 3789.74 speaker0  What's happening?
3786.06 3795.50 speaker2  It looks like maybe he was expecting documents of some sort.
3795.02 3799.74 speaker3  There is.
3798.70 3811.26 speaker0  It bounces back. Fax unable to send. It's not. So apparently it's not a fax machine. It's actually a modem on the receiving end. Does that just mean he's on the internet? Yeah. Yeah.
3807.18 3816.62 speaker2  So Joe doesn't know why a person would write down an internet address, modem address on a piece of paper. But, uh, my character probably would. It's a no, no, no.
3816.14 3825.18 speaker3  He didn't. He. So remember back in the day, you couldn't use the phone if you were connected to the internet or like, yeah.
3824.54 3832.22 speaker2  Well, okay. You used to get just to get a busy tone if that happened.
3831.82 3839.66 speaker4  I do. Who are you calling when you were three years old? You can wait.
3837.66 3842.14 speaker0  But you don't have to answer this, but how old are you? I was born in the mid eighties.
3841.82 3848.78 speaker4  All right. Yeah.
3844.14 3870.86 speaker0  And I remember AOL at age six, uh, doing exactly this. This is one of those like base.
3864.62 3882.78 speaker3  That means the call is coming from inside the house in this building using the internet. Or it's just us.
3881.42 3893.74 speaker4  It was a puzzle this whole time.
3893.26 3900.94 speaker0  Damn. And that's it. We're done. I inspect my own arm.
3898.54 3904.38 speaker4  We're all covered in tiny little needle marks.
3904.06 3943.26 speaker0  Okay. Maybe you're right in real life. It would be a busy signal in this world. The way the technology works, that means it's, it's logged in. That's the point of that you're supposed to get. I will give you something else just cause no one has, uh, the telecommunications, uh, networking skill. One thing you would notice that phone number is area code nine three one, which is not a Knoxville phone number. So it's a different area code than the phone number on the footer of his email. Nine three one is the area code for this County. So it seems to be a local number.
3939.90 3963.34 speaker3  He might be staying at the same motel we're staying at. and if he created Dilbert.
3962.06 3968.62 speaker0  How can I help you?
3966.86 3985.34 speaker3  down at the Sheriff's office.
3983.42 4041.66 speaker0  Let me check the records. They do here. This is, this is actually the town it originates in, in the early nineties. Oh no, he's been here. It looks like he's paid up for three more nights. Uh, who is this asking specifically about, uh, people saying at this, uh, motel that I probably should ask that before, um, I just give away information like this Yes. That okay. That makes sense. Sure. Um, yeah, no, no, no. He's here. Uh, he has two rooms down here at the motel.
4039.18 4059.50 speaker3  What a, which is what we're after him for.
4058.86 4066.06 speaker0  And what was your name? I'm the manager by the way. Uh, my name is Riker Yates.
4065.18 4119.58 speaker3  That's a strong name. Riker Yates. You liked that UFO stuff?
4116.38 4171.98 speaker1  It must be something inside of me.
4163.98 4223.50 speaker4  Breathing in, breathing out.
4217.66 4239.50 speaker2  No I won't get high. By all means do it if it helps. For me it makes my brain melt. Does anybody know why I can't get high? And I can't help but feel it I'll always be at the bottom.
