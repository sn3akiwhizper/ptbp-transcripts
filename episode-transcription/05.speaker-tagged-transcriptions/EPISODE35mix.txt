0.00 19.00 speaker0  Hey there y'all, it's your little ol' Wolfie boy again here on 694.2 PTBP
15.00 215.00 speaker1  It is currently 11 a.m. on December the 6th Today on Howlin' with Wolf we got ourselves an announcement from user totorosebangbus over on the subreddit Who posted about the show and tagged at pretending pod on Instagram Tag us on Instagram or Twitter at pretending pod Or write us a 5 star review on apple podcast and email us at pretendingpod at gmail.com Totorosebangbus writes Hello folks, Patreon here and I just want to say that I don't understand why you keep mentioning me But I would like to thank you for the influx of money that has come my way recently due to this show Thanks to you all, I am one step closer to getting my mushroom restaurant shiitake on me up and going in the city I'd like to offer everyone a 15% coupon off for when we do open My favorite part of the mushroom is all that nasty mud I hope they don't wash them off too much My producer has a note here Apparently a vast and overwhelming number of wolf pups are android users The fungus that dwells as a morel Give me that mushroom stew, baby, and give it some extra stank Speaking of blasphemous smells like rot and greed and cirrhosis piss, it's the hemorrhoids of truth, it's the news John Lee Pettymore or Kevin Lee Pettymore or whatever he's called himself now had a vision and is now convinced he has the second sight Keith Vigna desperately wanted to call the number left to them by Agent Kennedy Agent McKinley and Billy Harrison Oh shit, Kennedy, McKinley, Billy William Harrison? And taking us to that scene now, using the unnatural power to roll back time
205.00 262.00 speaker2  You see standing and materializing all at once on top of this crypt that is overlooking the clearing that you are standing in for the funeral of Ari Manstein There is this figure, this large, like six and a half foot tall humanoid figure with translucent skin It's got giant gaunt features wearing a black suit and it looks at Clark Bishop directly in the eyes and says It's like a man in black kind of thing, like a grey man Everyone roll sanity for me
260.00 272.00 speaker4  I fail
271.00 278.00 speaker2  No I did Yeah, I rolled a 90
276.00 302.00 speaker4  Also I need to borrow a pencil Why did you have to get this nice soft desk? I can't write anything on it
301.00 326.00 speaker2  You each lost one sanity That is correct, so keep that in mind Okay, very close A 21 with a breaking point of 20 Luke, where's Keith at?
323.00 347.00 speaker4  Alright, we are down to the end
345.00 351.00 speaker3  The acapella
347.00 356.00 speaker4  It's the PTBP acapella
354.00 364.00 speaker2  PTBP, PTBP
361.00 384.00 speaker3  Covering every boy band It took us a lot of takes, but we put them all on there
382.00 405.00 speaker2  Oh, we even have parodies Well, you have to get into parodies when you do that many versions Okay, so you each lose one sanity And the figure, the towering gaunt figure Is just staring at you and it slowly begins to hold out One of its overtly long hands
402.00 417.00 speaker3  Clark is going for his gun, but as he's doing it He's yelling at the thing
415.00 422.00 speaker2  Kevin John has very little left to live
420.00 426.00 speaker3  In greeting
424.00 440.00 speaker2  You're gonna try to shake its hand I mean, it's got a long arm, but I don't know if it's that long I would say the arm itself is 5 feet long Too long What is Keith doing? Keith runs behind a
439.00 454.00 speaker4  Anything A mausoleum? A mausoleum I run behind the closest mausoleum, pull my gun out and hide Alrighty
451.00 480.00 speaker2  I need you to roll power for me But overcome it in your ability to continue pointing this gun And the creature says
477.00 492.00 speaker0  Please give me the book
491.00 509.00 speaker2  And it says As it asks you your name
507.00 532.00 speaker3  What's your name?
530.00 560.00 speaker4  I peek around the corner Aim my gun at the guy and take a shot
556.00 596.00 speaker2  You fire this gun and you wing it in the arm And you see as the bullet flies through This arm just kind of like dissipates and then begins to slowly reform And before you have even smelled the smoke off of your firearm This creature is standing next to you with its hand on your throat And it lifts you up against the mausoleum
594.00 605.00 speaker4  Keeping them honest
603.00 618.00 speaker0  I was here for the funeral Why are you shooting?
616.00 624.00 speaker2  And you are not Oh dope
622.00 635.00 speaker3  When it was not on the mausoleum and was then at Keith Did we see it do anything or did it just blink?
633.00 647.00 speaker2  But it was all sped up This is likely what you think The other perspective was
645.00 665.00 speaker0  And then I will go Subject 1522518195518 There will be no trouble Give him the book man
663.00 699.00 speaker3  I don't have a book I don't have a book I came here with the clothes on my back and a gun I don't have a book Keith you got a book? Give him a book I don't read Is it looking at me when I do? We do not possess a book
697.00 721.00 speaker2  And begins tilting its head To the side Back and forth like a dog When you say squirrel And it says
719.00 727.00 speaker0  It is here you are Subject
725.00 737.00 speaker2  Freaking out it's getting really upset It doesn't understand Why you don't have this book And especially why you're not just
735.00 743.00 speaker0  Where are you? I'm here
741.00 747.00 speaker3  The city cemetery
745.00 753.00 speaker0  You should be here with
751.00 771.00 speaker4  Ari's coffin and open it up Roll search 84 on a 40 You've merely horrified her They are fucked up
769.00 801.00 speaker3  There's one old lady who has been sitting there She can't leave She can barely see He's holding his gun up To be not threatening now Can you describe The book? What book is it?
799.00 851.00 speaker0  For me to take Away from you You are not to be in Possession of the book Your time with it Has come to an end Now and We do not want you Using it any further I need to bring it What do you mean by
849.00 857.00 speaker4  2 nines
855.00 863.00 speaker2  Through this thing
861.00 869.00 speaker3  Like dissipated so maybe you're not hurting it but anyway
867.00 917.00 speaker2  And it falls Every single part of its body Dissipates into smoke as it hits the ground Including its suit And it is no longer Standing or existing In front of you I need all three of you To roll sanity 58 And Luke I need you to dive deep Go unconscious you will wake up With a new
915.00 923.00 speaker4  And I tackle him And I want to pin him down
921.00 927.00 speaker3  What fucking book was he talking about?
925.00 941.00 speaker2  Unarmed combat Just to see who See what happens here Keith
939.00 947.00 speaker3  I rolled an 11 A crit success
945.00 963.00 speaker2  Crit beats a 40 Automatically So as Keith comes running at Clark Clark you can describe what you want to do with his body As he is yelling At you about the book
961.00 971.00 speaker3  If you're diving at me I'm just gonna try to spin you past me You just whiff on me Maybe I'll throw you to the ground Fuck Keith
969.00 983.00 speaker4  I'm looking up at you from the ground Eyes wide Probably pupils Dilated and I'm Shaking in like fear
981.00 999.00 speaker3  Keith, Keith it's alright What's going on? I just I start to approach him hands up Kind of like a calm down kind of gesture
997.00 1005.00 speaker4  I've calmed down a little bit but I get up And I just start backing away from the both of you
1003.00 1011.00 speaker3  It looks like you got it I don't
1009.00 1033.00 speaker4  Summon that thing? I keep walking back And my back gets up Into one of the mausoleums and I kind of bump into it And I still like looking back between The both of you and I just I just faint
1031.00 1043.00 speaker3  Keith John he's out, he's out cold Let me slap him A few times to make sure
1041.00 1093.00 speaker4  Let me slap him, I don't think he's quite awake Slap, slap five times While I'm awake and I Keith you alright? I'm so sorry You know what? Came over me I'm sorry I didn't My heart is beating like a thousand miles a minute I'm sitting down I look up at both of them I'm really sorry Something in my brain just triggered I don't I'm really sorry I didn't mean to Attack you or accuse you but That thing just fucked me up
1091.00 1103.00 speaker3  The gray man Was he gray? Translucent He's a He's a man in black right?
1101.00 1119.00 speaker4  A little bit of marfing glass? Translucent skin Too big and small Do you have Any idea what book he was talking about?
1117.00 1173.00 speaker3  Any book I did find a bunch Of papers and documents and books At Jim Cook's house Maggie's father Maggie's father Maggie's father was part Of the circle of knowledge Did you find anything Left them there where I found them At Jim's house So it turns out that Maggie's dad was in the circle of knowledge As I was raveling through his papers I did find a leather Bound book that Boy it was It was freaky deaky Like a grimoire It was just the circle of knowledge
1171.00 1177.00 speaker4  You found was the book that fellow was talking about?
1175.00 1199.00 speaker3  I was racking my brain for books That's the one that just now came up Are you sure you don't have it? I don't have it Clark I know where it is No I don't have it
1197.00 1205.00 speaker4  Did it dissipate too? Yes
1203.00 1217.00 speaker3  The thing was that book it was freaky deaky I could only open it to the last page And I mean I could only Magnets almost? That's what it felt like
1215.00 1221.00 speaker4  Magnets you nailed it What did the last thing say?
1219.00 1243.00 speaker3  It had this drawing This hooded figure with light Coming out of its mouth but it wasn't actual light It was just drawn And written over the top of that Over and over and over the entire page It said It is only through death that he may rise again That's all I could see
1241.00 1247.00 speaker4  What did it look like?
1245.00 1293.00 speaker3  Like if you were to draw black scribbles In the shape of a hooded figure And then leave the middle of it Emanating light out of its mouth I used an eraser there In that part Clearly had some skill They knew how to use negative space They had a command of negative space I saw the contention High school art programs Fucking yearly fucking exhibition There's no motherfucking kids in that class Who can do that shit? None of them have command of negative space
1291.00 1297.00 speaker4  As much as I love talking about artwork right now
1295.00 1305.00 speaker3  That's my whole point is that it's fucking terrible If we take it as fact that that's the book it was looking for I might need to tell you a little more about it
1303.00 1309.00 speaker4  I'd love to hear about it
1307.00 1361.00 speaker3  It's some kind of Word text of some sort for the circle of knowledge And uh It has to do with the revelation Essentially the circle of knowledge Is hoping to The overseer's maybe a good guy Who lays peace on the world Or something like that Anyway, it's not the big thing I saw The big thing I saw was a scary thing That maybe combats it or something There's some reason they want the overseer It's not, that's what I mean The overseer is maybe the good guy And the thing I saw is the bad guy I don't know, I'm piecing it together as I go It's at Jim Cook's house Would I remember?
1359.00 1377.00 speaker4  I could bring you guys there if you wanted to see it Is that in contention?
1375.00 1421.00 speaker3  But Clark Robed and with light coming out of the mouth The circle had them The circle had a beautiful rim that gave me anything I wanted I think that was more mechanical than me
1419.00 1425.00 speaker4  I have no fucking idea what you're talking about right now Oh
1423.00 1429.00 speaker3  What do you mean by old Clark?
1427.00 1441.00 speaker2  Fingers deep into boiling water
1439.00 1475.00 speaker3  Kevin seemed to know that you were around I asked him How am I alive? And Kevin let me know that he thinks he saw Old me is what he said Old you? What does that mean? Did you say plural? Just like the figure he was just talking about In the grimoire
1473.00 1499.00 speaker4  Old Clark Clark in the future I know what old Clark means but is it a future Clark or is it a This is the first I'm hearing about this I'm super confused
1495.00 1503.00 speaker3  I'm looking for definitive answers in the middle of this horrifying circumstance
1501.00 1509.00 speaker4  Have heard of this before
1507.00 1563.00 speaker3  That apparently old Clark Dragged me into a room or something like that Drug me away And he reached into you And then you both disappeared Well that makes total sense So we can move on I mean if the circle of knowledge Has something to do with the light mouth in the book And then I woke up and then Maggie found me and took me into the circle of knowledge It sounds like they orchestrated it in some way To bring me into the fold I'll accept that for now Maybe old me blipped into existence
1561.00 1579.00 speaker4  Don't you think maybe Did you see them blip out? Was it the same way that Stan Manstein blipped out?
1577.00 1597.00 speaker3  No you was Old you was And then you did the thing and then you guys were gone
1595.00 1609.00 speaker4  If none of us know really Let's turn back to the task at hand Somebody's trying to get this book Do you think we should try to go Find that book? I mean
1607.00 1621.00 speaker3  We can drive there We can certainly go and get it I don't understand its significance is the only thing It was asking for it That's the book that it wanted I mean we can grab it just to make sure it's in our possession
1619.00 1643.00 speaker4  It's in the city We ought to drive over there get the book On the way we can call the Quote unquote FBI On the way over there and then we get the book and then You think we go to Glass?
1641.00 1671.00 speaker3  And then after that we do the Chewbacca plan with me We take care of business Fuck you Seth What was I rolling on? Anyway alertness
1669.00 1677.00 speaker2  Well that is a fail indeed Well that was fun with your plans That will certainly happen right now
1675.00 1681.00 speaker3  We're already out of the cemetery goodbye
1679.00 1687.00 speaker4  Both of you arrive here I drove the police car that we took
1685.00 1695.00 speaker3  Oh nice the circle provided me a car
1693.00 1697.00 speaker4  Well do you guys want to take the two cars
1695.00 1705.00 speaker3  Or do you just want to hop in the police cruiser
1703.00 1709.00 speaker4  Are you with Rosemary?
1707.00 1713.00 speaker3  On one of these mausoleums
1711.00 1719.00 speaker2  Who's got the best search between the three of you I have 40
1717.00 1721.00 speaker4  No I don't have the best search
1719.00 1733.00 speaker3  It's under S Oh shit I have the best search
1731.00 1755.00 speaker2  Was and you don't see her Looking around you might even Put your fingers on top of one of these mausoleums And lift yourself up and looking around I do that You see that she's not on any of them But what you do see Is two city police officers Heading straight your way
1753.00 1769.00 speaker3  Two city PDR They're hoofing it our way We might want to fucking skedaddle
1767.00 1779.00 speaker4  So let's get the fuck out of here I wait for John Lee Pettymore To get down from the mausoleum And I start booking it towards
1777.00 1791.00 speaker2  Okay are you guys just going out the same way you came in Through the normal route That one would take to get from the parking lot To this clearing? Taking directly the route away from the cops
1789.00 1803.00 speaker3  Even if we have to double back We're taking the route that will get us out of sight
1801.00 1815.00 speaker2  As you guys begin to recollect yourselves And head out through the back way We are now in combat order
1813.00 1825.00 speaker3  I turn around I mean I don't know if I would have had that still in my hand
1823.00 1827.00 speaker0  Everything's fine here fellas
1825.00 1833.00 speaker3  Contention PD We're getting out of your hair
1831.00 1837.00 speaker2  Keep your hands in the air
1835.00 1853.00 speaker3  I was gesturing to the coffin Which is open Because I had opened it up We lost a good one in the contention ranks I'm kind of frankly disappointed that you're crashing it like this They both have their guns up
1851.00 1867.00 speaker2  That went off during the funeral here
1865.00 1871.00 speaker3  I fucking pass a 16 on a 40 Alright the police officers
1869.00 1887.00 speaker2  Put their guns down and they say And they look at
1885.00 1901.00 speaker4  I pull my Contention police badge out and I say When I hung out with Ari We always like to go boating
1899.00 1929.00 speaker2  And they're like alright well uh And they're like we need to take statements from all of you I want to move up to intercept him Does Kevin have any kind of identifying information on him Yeah you would probably have Like a dirty dog keypad Something like that Okay I pull the dirty dog grooming keypad
1927.00 1933.00 speaker3  I don't think we need to have this conversation
1931.00 1977.00 speaker2  Oh and they kind of look at each other Oh oh oh And then they start whispering to each other And We are certainly sorry Please give our deepest apologies To Mr. Glass and Actually they cover up their names And badge numbers And they turn Sir again Deepest apologies please don't say anything To Mr. Glass we weren't even here That's god damn right And they turn around and they
1975.00 1989.00 speaker3  What's the keychain do Den of Sin and maybe some other
1987.00 1999.00 speaker4  The Den of Sin? Oh the Den of Sin you know where we were I saw a whole rowdy
1997.00 2007.00 speaker3  Open up a door on the floor Dirty dog grooming keychains
2005.00 2019.00 speaker4  Yeah that's exactly what John Peters had on him Well he was a dirty degenerate that couldn't Am I the only one who heard that?
2017.00 2031.00 speaker3  The Den of Sin is a name I don't know but I do The Den of Sin was the name of the place we were at We found those bedding stubs at John Peters house
2029.00 2035.00 speaker4  And John Peters he was telling a big story
2033.00 2041.00 speaker3  There wasn't really happening for him There's more to that than I remember
2039.00 2059.00 speaker4  Walk away I look Back at both of my I would say former co-workers And now I think we're Co-workers now again but in a different Capacity and I say
2057.00 2079.00 speaker2  Here in the clearing before You head out there are three Corpses of basically androids That are laying out And then also the body of Ari Manstein is in her coffin But not in a tomb I believe the funeral might have ended with Placing the coffin in the tomb
2077.00 2089.00 speaker3  And And then we probably Need to get on that crank and lower Ari
2087.00 2109.00 speaker4  And grabs three four more I think it's cooled down by this point Whoever was manning the fire Has been gone for a minute These are all above ground mausoleums
2107.00 2123.00 speaker2  There is one with an open door Tomb doors to the mausoleum
2121.00 2127.00 speaker4  You pick up the coffin
2125.00 2145.00 speaker2  And you begin walking her Into her crypt That she will stay in For the rest of her time
2143.00 2155.00 speaker4  We've done this twice already I looked for the book And then I also opened it up earlier To see if she was even in there She was? She is in there
2153.00 2159.00 speaker3  And there is no book in there Oh good, okay let's bury her
2157.00 2171.00 speaker4  I grab one of the bars And I close the coffin And I think the three of us Start walking into the mausoleum
2169.00 2241.00 speaker2  And as you walk in You hear a voice You might recognize Maybe a little bit quicker Than the other two Because it sounds So much like you And looking up You see these little sparks Of light as a voice Rings out chanting In the darkness You see these flashes and sparks Ignited seemingly by this Steady chant It emanates a piece of parchment Held by an old Clark Bishop wearing a dark cloak That is covering almost all of his Face as light begins Emanating from his mouth And the words he's chanting Begin to ignite And the fire lifts off the page And begins to dance in a circle Around you Looking up You all see his lifted hands Are cut open Pouring onto the ground
2239.00 2247.00 speaker3  Or constitution
2245.00 2251.00 speaker4  Baby Alrighty, so
2249.00 2303.00 speaker2  Luke, Keith, he loses No sanity whatsoever He rolled a 1, correct? And then Thomas, John Loses one sanity Clark, you also lose one sanity So this blood is Pooling on the ground Clark and John, both failing their sanity Checks, both drop their load Of the coffin, leaving Keith As the sole support And the coffin hits the ground Ari's corpse, limply plopping Into the muddy blood puddle In this dusty Cold crypt Alternatively, this Logically sashaying fire Surrounds you and bathes All three of you In a comforting, warm Light that feels familiar But the look on Joe's face says Otherwise
2301.00 2307.00 speaker3  Trying to get him to the ground
2305.00 2317.00 speaker2  On to an empty cloak And hit your face directly On the back of this Mausoleum
2315.00 2317.00 speaker3  Clark, that's the guy I was talking about I don't know
