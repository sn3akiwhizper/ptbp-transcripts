0.00 148.80 speaker0  What's snazzy, my pips? It's your knobby, sloppy, off-the-cobby, radio host with the absolute most. Your butter and egg man with jams and toast, it's Wolf the dog. If you're not yet big, then you may be a grower, cuz I'm blowin' your wig from my radio blower. Here on 694.2 PTBP, the internet's oldest and only radio station. This installment of Howlin' with Wolf is from The Duckman in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. They write, To the boys of Best Korea, Wibble Wobble Dingle Chungus, Wumbo Dingo Tringus, and a whole lotta love to you, Wolf, for introducing me to the magical musicians of Missouri known as Kudzu. No backbone is the bee's knees. You're the top dog in my books, Wolf. Keep up that good work, and I hope you find some extra good scraps in tonight's trash can. You shred it, Wheat. Remember, if you wanna write up somethin' for your wolf to howl, tag us on the internet, uh-uh, fuck Mark Zuckerberg, or write a five-star review on Apple Podcasts. All the links are in the damn show notes like they always have been. Why don't y'all take a look for one second? I'll wait. to set the stage for the special presentation I have for you today. So, uh, shake a leg, split with those getaway sticks, and grab a swell glass of city juice with your meat paws. In my cave, it's all wet to be dried out, so double down on your dog soup. I might be behind the grind, but these fine expressions from the time of Great Depression, they align with wolf's obsessions. Now, time to perform my midnight profession. So unwind from uniform strife and oppression, and mainline this newfangled warm-life lesson. It's Grady Philip Drug with Real Life.
143.80 223.80 speaker1  Easy times feel less than serene In the moment it's hard to count your blessings So we long for days gone past As grief and strife That's, that's 30, right?
221.80 292.80 speaker2  when you said nearly departed dipshit, but who is with us today is a man who I've spent a lot of time listening to and learning from about Call of Cthulhu and other horror gaming in general, Mr. Scott Dorward, whose credits include working on Cubicle Seven's World War Cthulhu line, let's see, working on Dead of Night, Cthulhu Dark, Pulp Cthulhu's first campaign, the Two-Headed Serpent, and of course, he is one of the good friends of Jackson Elias over on the absolutely delightful podcast, The Good Friends of Jackson Elias. Thanks for joining us, Scott.
290.80 301.80 speaker0  This is a great pleasure, and I am looking forward to putting you through hell.
298.80 322.80 speaker2  Ooh, love being on the other side of it. for the people listening at home and what you do? Yes, okay.
319.80 334.80 speaker0  I'm a big boy.
331.80 371.80 speaker1  I've worked primarily on Call of Cthulhu products, but done work on a number of other RPGs. I do a bunch of podcasting, as well as The Good Friends of Jackson Elias, which Zach mentioned. I'm also a cast member on the How We Roll podcast and a semi-regular on Ain't Slayed Nobody. So, yeah, I am.
368.80 377.80 speaker2  running The Bleak Prospect here.
375.80 580.80 speaker1  Yeah, this scenario, Bleak Prospect, comes from the Chaosium publication Nameless Horrors, which was the first book that Matt Sanderson, Paul Fricker, and I, The Good Friends of Jackson Elias, did for Chaosium some years back. And, yeah, this is not a happy scenario, but I'm sure we can find a few laughs in there, Excellent. So the scenario takes place in November of 1932. The setup is that you are all residents of the same shanty town are all people who have fallen through the cracks of society in the Great Depression. The Great Depression has been going on for a couple of years now This shanty town is perhaps a little more afflicted than most, however, because as well as the normal depredations of poverty and homelessness, you're also having to contend with a mystery disease that is going through the camp as well. Dr. Coombs, who we'll get to in a moment, has been doing some work on trying to research it and understand it and maybe find some way of helping the people who are afflicted. The main symptoms seem to be lethargy, muscle wasting, perhaps flaking skin, and just general sickness. People are just run down. The effect on the camp is varied. They're still functioning, even if they're not feeling tip-top. Others, however, are beginning to suffer quite badly. There are one or two, in fact one in particular, who we'll come to when we introduce Dr. Coombs, who is doing very badly indeed. There are a few kids who live in the camp, and they tell odd stories of how there are things going on at night, strange people, people who don't have faces. so I'm sure there's nothing to it and you have nothing to worry about. Shall we go around in turn and just say who you're playing and what has brought you to living in the shanty town?
575.80 654.80 speaker2  and I've been living in this Hoover town pretty much since its inception. I was a very, very bitter old man, just living in the city scrounging about my way, spending my time sending my fingers into another men's pockets, But now, now I live in the same world as everybody else, and it's nice, they've seen my side of things, and I'm showing them the dark ways of the world as well. Because the world, it's a terrible fucking place. But if you put a smile on, you just forget and forget about it, then everything's gonna be okay, okay, all right, hey! Perfect. Can we see if Zach's character has a face?
651.80 666.80 speaker1  I'm not entirely convinced that it's not just a mask or painted on, but yeah, he has what appears to be a face. So, Joe, do you want to introduce your character next? Sure.
665.80 674.80 speaker2  Yeah.
673.80 759.80 speaker3  I'm a burglar. Shit. Don't you hate it when that happens? Yeah. I was the head of the Bentham Hospital back in the day, and then the crash hit, and I fell with it, man. I ended up right there at the bottom. I got this thing I just can't figure out. It's making me, it's giving me blackouts. I can't find the will to move around some days. and I just, I can't figure it out. I just, I wish I was better. I wish I could just figure it out. I wish I could help them all, but I just can't get it. I don't know what it is. and my old protégé, Dr. Cavendish, he comes and helps sometimes, and there's, of course, Billy. He keeps everybody's spirits up around here as much as he can, I don't know what to do. Nice.
757.80 849.80 speaker2  Do I have this disease? Oh, boy. you probably know me. My story's not too dissimilar from Nathaniel's, from Dr. Coombes. I was doing good before the Depression. I had worked my way out of poverty. I'm a second-generation Irish immigrant, and I built more than my father had before me. I did it straight, unlike a lot of people in my neighborhood, and things were going good. I weathered the storm a little better than most. I was crawling my way back up. I was almost living like normal again, and then, like Nathaniel, I came down. I came down with this sickness, and it just took everything from me. It weakened me. At that point, it was almost like my partner, my business partner, was energized. He started succeeding in everything I failed at, and, well, he's got the business now, and here I am sitting with all of you. So, yeah, I kind of want to help the doctor here in any way I can, because what's eating away at me on the inside is eating away at a lot of people in this camp, and it's not right. Nice.
847.80 973.80 speaker1  People are getting up and about and performing their morning routines, such as they are. There's a group of people who are out making a campfire where they're going to boil up some used coffee grounds and possibly some old roots that they've dug up to make what passes for coffee around here. or, in some cases, buy to make some breakfast. He is a former journalist who worked at the Crawl Examiner, and Harold, out of all the patients you've had here, has been the worst hit with whatever this disease is. that this is going to be his last day. You can hear, oh, maybe what sounds like a death rattle in his lungs, but it's not quite like any death rattle you've heard before. It doesn't have that wet, phlegmy sound. It's a more dry, rasping rattle. Which seems to correspond with all the other symptoms you've seen recently. I mean, you've had trouble getting him to retain fluids, but it's more than dehydrated. He's desiccated. His skin is flaking. And this morning, you swear a couple of the times when he's had trouble breathing and coughed, you've seen a little cloud of dust come out of his mouth.
971.80 980.80 speaker3  or is this the first time it's actually... No.
978.80 1075.80 speaker1  you're going to lose to whatever this is. other than palliative care. He is beyond any help. His wife has been sitting in a little chair beside him for most of the night. And she's fallen asleep at this stage, and the exhaustion has just got to her. But with the noise outside, she's beginning to stir. Her name's Agatha. They're both actually fairly young, though you wouldn't think of it to look at Harold at the moment. They're both in their 30s. But he looks like, if you didn't know otherwise, you'd think that he was in his 60s at least, she stirs and she takes hold of his hand. There's this sort of cracking sound,
1073.80 1078.80 speaker3  OK, you're a doctor.
1077.80 1116.80 speaker1  Maybe not this weird. that there's bits of bone fragment poking out through this desiccated flesh, his hands trembling a little bit. One of the fingers where it's dropped on the ground, the desiccated flesh has dropped away from it a bit, He's still staring up at the ceiling.
1114.80 1127.80 speaker3  I want to see if he responds to light. Harold, are you still in there?
1122.80 1148.80 speaker1  but you've certainly got an electric flashlight that you can shine in there. It's a bit brute force, but it's better than nothing. And not only do his eyes not respond, but you see with all this dust that he's been coughing up, that there is actually a thin patina of dust across his corneas that he's not blinking off.
1147.80 1162.80 speaker3  Yeah. I'll check if he's breathing at this point.
1158.80 1173.80 speaker1  Agatha, understandably at this stage, is freaking the fuck out. She is screaming, she is crying, she is demanding to know what the hell is going on with her husband.
1171.80 1192.80 speaker3  but my point in calming her down is to say, Agatha, I'm sorry to say this might be your last chance to say anything you need to say to Harold. He doesn't have much longer. If you'd like to say anything, now would be the time.
1190.80 1241.80 speaker1  If you say so, Doctor. And she leans over him, and she's obviously trying very gingerly to find some way of holding onto him without damaging him further. there's tears dropping off her face, and where they're dropping onto his skin, they're just leaving little gouges as they run down. let's cut outside to... Yeah, let's go to Frederick, first of all. So, what's Frederick's morning routine? What does he normally do when he first gets up?
1238.80 1311.80 speaker2  and you see some children playing. You don't see Frederick Mellon the first because he is hiding inside a half-rotted-out metal barrel that they used to make fires for some time until it eventually disintegrated and was no longer useful, so it's kind of half-rolled over. And he is inside waiting for these kids to get just close enough for him to just pop out He's just trying to really, really give them a show. And as soon as their eyes are massive, he holds out a single-dollar bill. The world has joy. Joy for you, joy for me. Yes, take it.
1308.80 1363.80 speaker1  With that, the three kids start fighting over the dollar in a very spirited way. I mean, there are kids of various ages throughout the camp, and there's normally four of them who travel around in this particular group. I mean, the camp's only got about 15 people in it, so there aren't that many kids. that normally go around and do all the mischief, There's one of the girls, Esther. Yeah, the other kids look up and sort of half pay attention to what he's saying. I always get her and Benji confused. And then go back to fighting over the dollar because they haven't seen the whole dollar for a very long time.
1361.80 1387.80 speaker2  So he kind of raises it up, and he's like, okay, okay, I was gonna give it to you, by answering me a question, all right? Now, where is this Esther? Where's your friend who runs around with you? and now just today she's gone. Yeah, do you like that change?
1385.80 1396.80 speaker1  One of the little boys looks up and says,
1393.80 1408.80 speaker2  kind of coughing slightly to himself as he just holds the dollar out and hands it to him. A smile just grows across his face as he watches the kids.
1406.80 1429.80 speaker1  out of your hand and goes running off down the camp with the other two kids chasing him in, let's say, a playful manner, but the same kind of playful manner as you'd expect from hungry dogs. Yeah.
1427.80 1432.80 speaker3  might play someday if we're lucky.
1430.80 1444.80 speaker2  Whoa!
1440.80 1492.80 speaker1  she lives with her mother, a woman called Mrs. Frain, who you may know as Maureen, Her husband killed himself a little while back. She used to come from money, and you know that she's very protective of her daughter, but at the same time, she's been quite ill with the disease that's going on around here. I mean, Esther, as far as you know, has been one of the healthier people in the camp, and it's really unusual not to see her up and about. I mean, her mother's been bedridden for a little while, but Esther definitely should be up and about at this stage.
1489.80 1502.80 speaker2  Kind of, he's curious, so he's just going to kind of poke around where his nose shouldn't be.
1499.80 1504.80 speaker1  They never see me coming in.
1502.80 1508.80 speaker2  I'm very stealthy.
1506.80 1513.80 speaker3  and you're like, we need a monster.
1509.80 1562.80 speaker2  I am playing a nice, optimistic, and pits children against each other. I've been watching, and I enjoy the way Luke plays a game. Thank you, Tommy.
1557.80 1625.80 speaker1  So, yes, you take a look inside the tent, Well, I say cots. I mean, they're fairly makeshift things that have been cobbled together out of spare wood and whatever cloth and, in some cases, newspaper they've managed to get hold of. But let's call them cots. And one of them is empty. In fact, it looks almost undisturbed. The other one has got Maureen Frayn lying in it. And you're not sure whether she's alive or dead. She is, at the very least, badly injured. There is blood down her face, and it looks like someone has bludgeoned her. There's blood splattered all over her sheets. And, yeah, she does not look in a good way.
1622.80 1652.80 speaker2  unable to decide what to do. He is just going to give the room a quick once-over to decide, A, if there is any, like, fight put up, any sort of distress actions happening in this room,
1649.80 1771.80 speaker1  so it would be very difficult for someone to be hiding in here and for you not to see them. But as far as trying to discern the details of what happened goes, let's have a spot hidden role. As far as the state of Maureen is concerned, you reckon, for a start, that she's still alive. You can see her chest rising and falling slightly, but there's, like I say, a fairly nasty head wound. The other things you clock are that Esther's bed, like I say, I mean, seems to be largely unmade, but perhaps more unusually, the thick winter coat that she had that is obviously fairly vital at this time of year is still there beside her bed, as are her shoes. So, you know, if she is up and about or outside the tent, on a cold November morning like this without her coat and shoes, that's not going to be good for her. is there is something tucked underneath Maureen Frayn's bed, and it's wrapped up in cloth, but it must have been disturbed when whatever happened last night happened, and you can see that she does have what looks like a fairly nice, a very expensive-looking shotgun tucked under her bed.
1770.80 1784.80 speaker2  You'll get to know him. It'll be fine.
1779.80 1788.80 speaker4  and walk quickly toward the doctor's abode.
1787.80 1835.80 speaker1  Wherever he might be working. It's not where he lives. He lives in a tent just next to it, but he's got a shack which serves as, I guess, a sort of field hospital that has got a couple of cots in it and has got what equipment he's managed to salvage or get from various sources, what medical equipment and drugs and so on. And so, yeah, you can make your way over there. Thomas Dolan, how you doing? What's Thomas Dolan's morning routine? Is he up and about at this time?
1831.80 1857.80 speaker2  but he's tired in the mornings a lot of times, so he might be just dragging himself out of his shack right about this time and seeing if anybody around the campfires has some extra coffee.
1854.80 1946.80 speaker1  and there are only a couple of people sitting there. There's Dr. Rothstein, who you know was some kind of university lecturer, who's sitting there, warming his hands. He's making the coffee at the moment. Her name is Nancy, Nancy Carver. And she worked in a lawyer's office, you think, before everything went south. And she is sitting there with an absolutely vacant look in her eyes. She's just looking at the flames, and you can see that there is actually, in the back of her hair and on her coat, there are some ice crystals there that suggest that she might actually have been sitting there all night. Her eyes just go a bit wider, and she looks at the fire more, and then she forces herself to look up and looks over at you. Where am I? Where am I? Where am I?
1943.80 1957.80 speaker2  There's me, Thomas Dolan, and there's Rothstein right there.
1952.80 1992.80 speaker1  I was here. I was here. I was here last night. Why can't I remember? What do they do to me? Who? Who, Nance? Who did what to you? They were here last night. They did something, Thomas.
1990.80 1998.80 speaker2  Has she been like this all morning?
1994.80 2002.80 speaker1  She just taps the side of his head and then goes back to making the coffee.
1998.80 2026.80 speaker2  Can I do a, I was going to say a psychology check, but I don't know if that would. No, 76 on a, I think it's a 40.
2020.80 2032.80 speaker1  I mean, even without the role, I mean, it seems unlikely that she'd be lying about something like this. I mean, she seems genuinely upset, but.
2028.80 2048.80 speaker2  Yeah, but it's the 30s, so we don't believe victims yet. Look at this, there's ice all over the back of her fucking head.
2044.80 2071.80 speaker1  I went and got, I got some roots. I added them to the coffee. You know, the grounds are, grounds are all moldy today. Grounds are all moldy.
2069.80 2094.80 speaker2  Was she in vaudeville?
2086.80 2107.80 speaker1  And my God, Thomas, they made it sing. And she just bursts into floods of tears.
2098.80 2176.80 speaker2  It's like, all right, well, Nance is off a rocker. I don't know if that's, you know, so out of character. Well, these are hard times. Everybody gets a little weird. Oh, yeah. Dolan is definitely confused by this, but I don't think he clocks it as, as supernatural or anything. It just seems like a drunk woman in the depression. Yeah, that seems entirely reasonable. I gotta go say hi to Dr. Combs. Maureen got hit on the head. Why don't I... Let's walk her on down there.
2171.80 2203.80 speaker4  And then we'll try to hold her arm up on the other side to help her walk. And we skip away.
2193.80 2217.80 speaker1  You can see what appear to be a couple of fingers lying on the ground. The side of Priestley's face is melting slightly. There is a death rattle coming from his lungs. And what's Dr. Combs doing while all this is happening?
2216.80 2288.80 speaker3  Yeah, sure. To try and pull that closed and meet them past the curtain. Give Agatha and Harold privacy. Okay. What's going on here, guys?
2279.80 2307.80 speaker4  So I went to see if she was home with Maureen and turns out Maureen, big old gash on her head. You know, so definitely needs to be checked out for sure. But, you know, not awake maybe.
2299.80 2324.80 speaker3  Nathaniel's going to start gathering up a doctor's bag. And Nance, why are you here? Are you feeling all right?
2322.80 2327.80 speaker2  I think that thing's going to freak her out.
2325.80 2337.80 speaker3  Little Gregory? What's the problem with Little Gregory?
2332.80 2355.80 speaker2  And she's had a fairly traumatic puppet-related experience in the past. And also, just having a puppet of Rasputin seems very strange.
2351.80 2468.80 speaker3  All right, Nance, let's get you warmed up. Let's have you get over here by this fire. And he goes and grabs an unused blanket to wrap around her and gets her right up close to the fire. Is my little buddy Billy in the tent right now? No, he hasn't turned up yet this morning. It sounds like somebody's hurt. I'll be back as soon as I can. If anything happens, you can come and find me. I'm going to be over at Maureen's place. Nancy's sitting in here. She's going to warm up a little bit. I'll be back as soon as I can. And I'll let the guys lead me to, or whoever wants to go with me, lead me to Maureen's tent.
2459.80 2490.80 speaker4  As he kind of lays his hand about to show off the body of Maureen and be like,
2488.80 2498.80 speaker2  Thomas Dolan is crossing himself.
2497.80 2527.80 speaker3  I surely did not. And then he's going to, yeah, Nathaniel is going to start doctoring Maureen. Okay. Trying to stabilize her and see if I can tell what happened and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, give me a first aid roll then.
2522.80 2604.80 speaker1  She has taken a very nasty head wound. At the very least, she's got a concussion. She's drifting in and out of consciousness and she's not really with it at the moment. Ideally, she should be in the hospital, but you know the hospital will take her. Did you recognize these men, Maureen?
2603.80 2642.80 speaker2  Done.
2634.80 2677.80 speaker1  You'd listen for a few moments just to make sure. There's definitely no heartbeat.
2675.80 2685.80 speaker2  Oh.
2684.80 2718.80 speaker3  Sorry about that. Do you need to go and pick it up? Are you sure? What if it's really cool? Let's get him.
2717.80 2729.80 speaker2  Yeah, this is excellent. Oh, glad you're enjoying it. I really am.
2723.80 2785.80 speaker3  I was hearing a scratching and scratching from inside a thing I should not be hearing a scratching and scratching coming from. He's going to look for external sources and maybe like under the bed and see if that's if there's something underneath there or something. It definitely is. The call is coming from inside the body. No, no, you can't.
2775.80 2794.80 speaker1  One of the side effects really of this desiccation of Priestly's flesh is that even prodding it and poking it. Yeah, there's no elasticity. It's quite rigid now.
2792.80 2827.80 speaker3  She's in this room with us, right? Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Agatha, if you could step out of the room, please. I'll make sure that Harold here is cared for. We'll arrange funeral arrangements together here in just a bit. Just step outside that curtain there for me.
2825.80 2835.80 speaker2  I mean, Mrs. Priestly? I am Mrs. Priestly.
2833.80 2837.80 speaker1  She has shut down completely.
2836.80 2864.80 speaker3  This is kind of... I should have asked this a long time ago. Is she terribly affected by this disease also or is she kind of doing okay?
2863.80 2911.80 speaker4  Yeah.
2908.80 3289.80 speaker1  It's cracking and crumbling as you're doing so. Yeah, there's no blood, there's no fluid coming out, and there's just chunks of what was his abdominal wall falling away. And inside you catch sight, first of all, of something colorful. I mean, you think perhaps initially it's one of his internal organs because it is sort of glistening and iridescent, but no, it's not that. And there's another one, another one, these little round things. Something, I mean, it's only a couple of inches long, but it's sort of cucumber shaped, but there are little barbs or spikes coming off it. And it lifts its front end up towards you and the whole thing irises out, and you can see this sort of mouth with all these little sharp teeth. And suddenly this sound that sounds an awful lot like a baby crying coming from it. No! You stagger back and unconsciously just try to support yourself by grabbing onto the nearest thing you can, which unfortunately is the privacy curtain that you set up. And as you put your weight on it, you just crack the pole that it was on. The whole thing comes down. As you land down heavily on the ground, crushing one of the fingers beneath you as you do so. And the rest of you from outside can hear this cracking wood sound. And then a moment later from the other side of the privacy curtain, the sound of Nancy Carver screaming as she can see the things wriggling around inside the remains of Harold Priestley's abdomen. Oh, fuck. And you can see the ruptured remains of one of these, what you realize are now eggs, which seems to be what this has come out of. And as you're looking around at the other sort of iridescent shapes there, you can see dark shapes moving around within those. You tip him up slightly and his right arm just breaks off and lands on the ground.
3288.80 3392.80 speaker2  You have a basement?
3388.80 3507.80 speaker3  And, uh, and look out for that, that one. It's got teeth. And he's, he's pointing to the one that's still, I think, warming around in the body cavity. I don't know. I mean,
3505.80 3555.80 speaker2  More like a scalpel to stab the little fucker.
3551.80 3586.80 speaker4  And so we'll kind of back off or help you with the Mason jars.
3581.80 3609.80 speaker1  You've got about a half dozen plus this hatch specimen. Gross.
3607.80 3646.80 speaker3  Can I squash it? And I don't, I don't know. I need to run some tests. I need to, I need to know if there's a way to make these not be.
3636.80 3667.80 speaker1  You've got Agatha Priestly, who's outside, who is now just wandering around, just trying to get her bearings. You've got Nancy Carver, who is still in some kind of fugue state.
3663.80 3898.80 speaker3  I could, I could use, I could use help here today of all days. Frederick, Dolan, have you, you guys, you guys seen Billy today? Yeah, yeah, let's do that, let's see, let's.
3890.80 3914.80 speaker4  But now he can burgle so few because there are only so few who actually have anything to burgle.
3899.80 3958.80 speaker2  Seeing this very human moment, Thomas Dolan takes out his grandfather's fiddle and plays, plays a mournful tune, but I'm pretty sure he only has 30 in fiddling.
3952.80 3966.80 speaker1  Yeah, sure. Yeah. I mean, I, I, either spot hidden or track would help there.
3962.80 4077.80 speaker3  I hit it. I don't know how that works in this game. I hit, it's 25 on a 25. I point that out to my compatriots here. It looks like a, it looks like they went this direction, which I think we should, I think we should see where it leads.
4075.80 4148.80 speaker1  I assume you want to. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the drag marks, they meet up with a number of other sets of footprints. You reckon there were maybe like three or four people in the camp last night. The footprints, they look like men's shoes and I mean, definitely shoes and not boots. And from the general footprints that you can see, they look like they were probably in relatively good condition, which is unusual for people in the camp. And from the angle of the tire tracks, it probably drove off towards Arken or at least away from Crawley, away from the town, out of town.
4146.80 4219.80 speaker2  Hey, didn't Dr. Rothstein used to work in Arken? He did. Well, maybe we can show him around. I mean, maybe he can show us around. That's right, yeah. We just don't know that they go all the way.
4210.80 4278.80 speaker1  The woman who runs it, Ida, I think she doesn't really like it when people from the Hooverville turn up there. She certainly won't serve you there because you drive away paying customers. But on the other hand, if she's throwing food and old coffee grounds and stuff like that out, she'll generally let you have it for free.
4275.80 4320.80 speaker4  And they're open late, I assume? Oh, yeah. That's a good idea. Even if not, we can see if she's got any grounds at all.
4313.80 4330.80 speaker1  They're probably not big enough to be a truck, but they certainly look like they're from a car that's bigger than your average car.
4327.80 4362.80 speaker2  Oh, yeah. Hyrum. Hyrum Melnick. Hyrum Melnick. Let's go ask him if those are Rolls Royce Phantom tracks.
4356.80 4439.80 speaker4  And, you know, I'm fairly well versed in the thick and thin of a tire. And just kind of poke around, poke around, poke, poke. Okay, so that's a hard success.
4431.80 4458.80 speaker1  But on the other hand, yeah, I mean, you know, you mentioned Hiram's old Rolls Royce. Yeah, I mean, this could be a Rolls Royce. It could be a big model Cadillac. I mean, whatever it is, you're fairly certain that, I mean, it's from a luxury car of some kind. The kind of car that really would stand out.
4457.80 4495.80 speaker2  Yeah. There it is.
4489.80 4524.80 speaker1  Yeah, it's obviously open. There's a few cars parked outside. And you can see that there are people eating, being served in there. But yeah, going around the back and knocking on the door. Yeah, Larry, the short older cook, comes and opens up the back door and just goes,
4520.80 4530.80 speaker2  Doc, they're nice to you. They give you, you know, they feed you here.
4529.80 4563.80 speaker3  Yeah. I was wondering if I could, were you here last night? You might be able to help me. I was going to talk to Ida, but if you were here last night, I could ask you too. No.
4557.80 4601.80 speaker1  But then about two minutes later, Ida comes to the back door. She's looking a bit harried. There's a pencil tucked, and she's got her hair up in a bun, her graying hair. And she's a fairly round, ruddy-faced woman. She's got a pencil tucked behind her ear, looking a bit flustered, and says, You're too early for the leftovers and coffee grounds. Look, come back, come back, say five o'clock. I'll give you what I can then, okay? Sorry.
4596.80 4626.80 speaker3  but we're missing a couple people from camp. We have reason to believe they came up this way. You didn't happen to see, I guess, anything strange, but especially a pretty nice car come through here last night? A big one.
4617.80 4679.80 speaker1  I mean, there was a big black car that drove up. Yeah, yeah, I didn't really think much of it at the time. It wasn't much traffic, but yeah, it was a Cadillac, I think. Big Cadillac. I think it belongs to the man who bought Greenleys. Is that right? Greenleys? I mean, you know that's one of the estates just up the road from here.
4677.80 4700.80 speaker3  That's just up the road, right? Yeah, it's like a mile up the road. All right. Ida, thank you. That helps us a lot, actually. That points us in a pretty concrete direction. We were never here.
4692.80 4718.80 speaker1  I'm thinking now that I maybe shouldn't have told you that if you're going to go around and cause trouble with the good man who lives there. Don't let me be hearing from the police that you've gone up there and done something stupid, all right?
4709.80 4760.80 speaker2  We're not going to be dealing with anybody in society who might get the feathers ruffled. This is bum business.
4759.80 4800.80 speaker4  Affection.
4797.80 4815.80 speaker1  For starters, it's really great to have an opportunity to play with you guys. It's great to have a chance to run this game because it's been a long time since I've done so. I've never actually recorded this one.
4811.80 4834.80 speaker3  Scritching and scratching got me.
4832.80 4837.80 speaker4  Thomas Dolan.
4834.80 4841.80 speaker1  So, are you heading...
4839.80 4868.80 speaker3  The question on everyone's mind is that we either...
4863.80 4877.80 speaker1  Are you going back to the camp for any reason?
4870.80 4883.80 speaker2  Maybe go ask Hyrum some questions about his business partner who now owns Green Lees.
4878.80 4898.80 speaker3  At the very least, he could give us a lay of the land, maybe tell us about the house.
4892.80 4900.80 speaker4  it's smart to ask him questions about doors and windows and other holes. Just any holes.
4899.80 4913.80 speaker3  Yeah, let's do that. All the house holes.
4908.80 4921.80 speaker2  No one knows it like a former homeowner. Boston.
4918.80 4999.80 speaker1  You head back to the camp. At this stage, when you get back to the camp, Hyrum has gone over to the medical tent. Having heard that Nancy is there, he's basically kneeling on the ground beside Nancy, just talking to her, comforting her. Nancy, I mean, what happened to her? She's just, I don't know. She's saying all sorts of crazy things about men with no faces and puppets and, yeah, something about a singing puppet.
4998.80 5009.80 speaker2  But it is weird. A lot of weird things are going on. Hyrum, we need to ask you about your old estate.
5004.80 5070.80 speaker4  I'm starting to say with 100% confidence that the people who did this, who came into our Hoveville and took our little Esther and our medium-sized Billy, and took them all out, they took them to Greenlee's, the place that you used to own. And now the livers in there, the people, the internal organs who do their business inside the house that you once called your own abode, they're the ones who came in here and they might not have faces from what she's saying, but we're not sure about that, but we can be positive that it's those, those are the ones who did then do this to us and we're gonna fight back, not only gonna fight back with guns and with fists, but we're not gonna do either one of those things. We're gonna fight back with stealth. They're not gonna know we were there. We were never there. And we'll come back with our people and they won't know it.
5067.80 5081.80 speaker2  Because it used to be your home, you tell us what you think. Right, questions.
5080.80 5118.80 speaker1  No. That's, yeah, that's crazy. I mean, you know, the man's an animal, he's, you know, he's a thief, he's the scum of the earth, but kidnapping kids? Yeah, he's got plenty of cars. He bought my old cars along with the house and, yeah, he always had cars of his own.
5113.80 5130.80 speaker2  but Billy and Esther were, like, 100% seen taken away from here in a big black caddy towards your estate.
5123.80 5182.80 speaker1  As I say, I always knew Caspar was a thief, but stealing children? Yeah, well, yeah, you got to go get him back. I mean, look, I'll tell you what, if you want to get in there, take him by surprise, you go around the back, there's some old servants' quarters around there. I mean, I never had anyone there, but there's old servants' quarters. And yeah, I mean, I don't know if he's had any work done, but there's a window just by the back door that the lock on that is terrible, terrible, terrible lock. I was meant to get it fixed.
5178.80 5197.80 speaker4  You've got two kids and you're trying to hide them, and you live in your old house. Where would you put them?
5190.80 5216.80 speaker2  but that also answers my next question, which is where would be the best place to sacrifice two children in your old estates? Anyway, we should think, Hiram, you've been a big help. Let's go, right guys? Hiram, do you want to come?
5213.80 5232.80 speaker1  You know, the state she's in. Yeah, she, no, I'll stay here with her. That's wicked smart.
5231.80 5245.80 speaker3  Okay.
5243.80 5286.80 speaker4  Frederick Dolan I, I took your name. You took my first. He's like patting off Hiram's shoulders of any dust or anything on his shoulders and kind of touching at his cap and pulling up his shirt and making him look nice. And he's just saying, thank you, thank you, thank you so much.
5285.80 5289.80 speaker1  Yes.
5288.80 5293.80 speaker4  Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah.
5292.80 5309.80 speaker1  So yeah. Yeah. He takes his hat off. You got to tell me how you do that someday, man.
5303.80 5332.80 speaker4  And then he, uh, he dips off and says, uh, I'll meet you guys, uh, up there at the front. I'll be just a second. Uh, and when he comes back, he comes back with a, with a shotgun, hopefully. I have only shot it like twice.
5329.80 5338.80 speaker2  Would that, would it be realistic to say he has a pistol stowed away or something?
5337.80 5341.80 speaker1  You got to fiddle.
5340.80 5371.80 speaker2  I'm the bard. I've got to start acting like it. So, um, yeah, Thomas Dolan plays a mournful, but, um, but hopeful tune, bittersweet would be the best word for it as we set out on the road for our adventure.
5365.80 5391.80 speaker1  up in the, the medical shack before you head out, one thing you notice, the Mason jar that you left with the, the eggs and the, the specimen in it.
5389.80 5410.80 speaker2  before we hit off that trail. You do.
5403.80 5414.80 speaker1  The, the lid of it is still sealed, but there does seem to be a little trail of slime coming out the side of it.
5412.80 5433.80 speaker3  How did it, how did it get out of the, out of the jar? It's, and I, I hold it up and kind of shake it a little. It's intact. Oops. And he sets it down carefully.
5431.80 5466.80 speaker2  It's lit away. Not that hot. Let's look for, let's look for where it's livid. Yeah.
5459.80 5470.80 speaker3  Maybe I can sedate Agatha for, for a while, just until we figure out a way to destroy Maureen Frayn. I'm sorry, Maureen.
5469.80 5485.80 speaker2  Doc, no offense. That sounds overly cautious. I don't think anybody in the future is going to judge you if we eliminate this host right now in an abundance of caution.
5483.80 5495.80 speaker3  I could say I could save her potentially. We could figure this out and I could save her. We just need to make sure she doesn't leave here while we're gone.
5491.80 5510.80 speaker2  Does it look like it crawled through a nostril or a mouth or something or did it bury like right into her abdomen? Poke around, Doc. See what you find. Maybe, I mean, like pull her shirt up above her belly button, see if it's still trying to crawl in. Right.
5509.80 5571.80 speaker1  Exactly. You kind of pull her shirt up and there is, yeah, that little trail of slime that then Well, as Dr. Coombs examines and looks for a wound or any mark, you press her abdomen just where that trail ends and your finger just sinks in through her flesh. It's like sticking your finger into a bowl of warm porridge. Appropriate.
5568.80 5587.80 speaker3  It's a 9 on a 37. Yeah, you're fine then.
5579.80 5601.80 speaker1  And what's really, really weird about this is there doesn't seem to be a wound. As you pull your finger out, there is no indication that you even broke the skin. Wow.
5600.80 5655.80 speaker3  Mercifully, no. Fellas, I felt it in there. It's in there. I felt it wriggling around. There's a chance I could get it with my tweezers. Do you think I should or do you think we should? Thomas Dolan is shakily handling you, your surgical tongs. the wriggling creature that I felt a second ago. My goal is to pull it out. Frederick, get the jar ready. The jar didn't do fucking nothing last time. Well, let's have a Dex roll to see how well you pull this off. I'm going to pull this off. Oh, no.
5654.80 5666.80 speaker4  Well, you've got a couple of options.
5660.80 5700.80 speaker1  Alternatively, you could push the roll so that you haven't quite managed to get an angle in there with the forceps, but if you really push, you could try to force me.
5697.80 5710.80 speaker3  That brings my luck down to 19.
5708.80 5762.80 speaker1  that's permeable. But, yeah, you manage to get hold of the wriggling creature and pull it out. And, yeah, it's writhing around within the forceps and screaming again. It's pretty much doubled in size.
5760.80 5796.80 speaker3  We can't risk it getting out again. Let's destroy this one. And I've got the eggs that I can run my tests on. So how are you destroying it? Boot it. Yeah, I'm going to drop it on the ground and try and step on it. Okay. Dudes, I failed with a 100.
5791.80 5818.80 speaker1  And there's no resistance, no squishing sound, nothing like that.
5816.80 5843.80 speaker3  Did you get out from under it? I don't see it. It's not, where is it?
5838.80 5894.80 speaker1  is perversely, you have a sense of immense wellbeing. For some reason, your spirits are lifted and yeah, you feel almost a surge of hope and just this lightness in your heart that hasn't been there for a long time.
5886.80 5900.80 speaker0  In the moment it's hard to count your blessings. So we long for days gone past us. Grief and strife, bloody, that's real life.
