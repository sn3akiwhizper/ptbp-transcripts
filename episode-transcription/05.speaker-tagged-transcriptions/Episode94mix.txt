0.00 42.60 speaker0  my closest comrades. Some of you may have noticed a strange occurrence in the past couple weeks. I, Wolf the Dog, your fearless leader, have been held against my will for a time. But I have escaped the torturous restraints of Judge Ephraim Cortland's sloppy meat trees he calls hands. And I am now back triumphantly crawling once again into your ear holes. Here on 694.2 PTBP, contention's oldest and only radio station.
39.24 179.56 speaker1  I think it's about damn time for some truth. Fuck every billionaire. Greed should only exist in the dumpster. Mm, what's wet, stinky, and made for sharing? It's the news. No shit, that disgusting excuse of a human, contention's so-called Judge Ephraim Cortland, was keeping me locked up in a cell. I'm deeply sorry to leave you so unsatisfied for so long, my pups. I promise to never get caught in a slop trap ever again. Trapped me with slop bait once, shame on you. Trapped me with slop bait twice, shame on you. Trapped me with slop bait three times, what the fuck is wrong with you? It's clear I can't help myself. And your crew would just take an advantage of that? Silas Cole can host any trials or legal matters out on his property by the mine. And he may as well preside over them too. He is, after all, the reason contention is so very prosperous. Can't You Hear the Wolves Are Howlin'? ["Can't You Hear the Wolves Are Howlin'?" plays in bright rhythm.] How do you do?
178.32 180.96 speaker0  How do you do?
179.56 186.56 speaker1  How did I not know that?
185.72 193.24 speaker0  Howdy. Which then became howdy. Howdy. Howdy. How did I not know that?
192.40 195.48 speaker1  Hey.
194.48 207.76 speaker0  Got it. I've got something that good for you here. Why did the cowboy take hay to bed to feed his nightmares? Oh my God. Mm.
206.92 213.00 speaker1  Mm-hmm.
212.16 218.68 speaker0  No, no more good. No, no good ones, but I've got another one. What did you Google?
216.28 227.24 speaker1  It looks like he's really enjoying it. I'm Googling cowboy jokes.
225.72 228.92 speaker0  It's a very cute smile. A hand behind the head.
228.08 234.72 speaker1  Oh, another cute smile.
230.68 238.68 speaker0  Oh my God, that one's even better.
234.72 246.36 speaker1  What do you call a happy cowboy? A jolly rancher. Oh.
244.60 284.80 speaker0  Luke, have you delivered this joke before? Luke's been sending him these all week. so let me try, okay, my hotspot is on, Okay, that worked. You could have kicked Luke
283.40 288.36 speaker1  Yeah, you're yeah. Yeah, you're yeah.
286.40 302.84 speaker0  Did you see that Alec Baldwin roast with like his daughter was doing it? Yeah. Yeah, like at a roast thing and the opening.
301.04 306.36 speaker2  Oh my God, Luke's frozen in the exact same. It's in spotting, it was just the smile.
305.20 328.04 speaker0  That's insane. Screenshot. It's so cute. What a cutie. I hope he looks like that forever. He will, have you seen his fucking dad? Oh, that's so true.
324.48 337.68 speaker2  Well, Efron fell off his damn old horse, broke his big ass spine in twain. I fucking wish. Everett crawled inside him. Oh, okay, let's go.
336.68 341.44 speaker0  You seem good.
339.52 354.00 speaker2  Can you put your arm behind your head and smile for us really quick?
350.36 487.92 speaker0  shackled by preacher-sheriff Dr. Bobby Custard with Judge Ephraim Cortland standing right behind him, right next to the preacher-sheriff doctor watching as Jack Perlman, Professor Horace Green and Everett Pace loaded the rug out of the back of Silas Cole's wagon and then slowly unfurled the rug after seeing shoes on one side and Everett, I believe, reached in to the other side and felt some patchy hair, a very thin-skinned scalp, almost touching the skull right off the bat. And as soon as the rug is completely unfurled, hopping onto all four haunches, haunches? Haunches. Haunches. Haunches are like, would be with your legs, right? Hopping onto her back two haunches with her human arms in front of her. No, she's in a two and a half point stance. Velociraptor. Which means she's got like one arm kind of halfway down. The other one's on a knee, elbow on a knee. You notice there are no fingernails on her hands that are moving back and forth quickly with these wild eyes. She just slits right under them from where her cheekbones are poking through the thin skin on her face, blood dripping down and she lets out a guttural scream. If it's a one or a two, she's gonna attack Jack Perlman. No. If it's a two or a three, she's gonna attack, oh, three or four, she's gonna attack Everett Pace. No. Five or six, it's gonna be Professor Horse Green. Hey Luke, can you roll a D6 for me and tell me what you get? Six. Oh, that's gonna be Professor Horse Green that she jumps directly toward.
486.04 499.68 speaker2  You made him your executioner. Sorry.
495.76 530.28 speaker0  What does Professor Horse Green do as this human wearing these unfathomably out of fashion clothes with thin skin, open mouth, tongue waggling about, jumping at you, arms first, these fingernail-less hands going to grip onto either side of your shoulders.
529.44 533.16 speaker2  And gets a,
531.52 539.16 speaker0  And gets a what? A hundred.
537.32 549.80 speaker2  Oh my God. What? What? Holy shit. You nailed it.
548.08 628.04 speaker0  Oh no. is still in the holster when you reach down to grab it, pull it out, and you flick the trigger right there on your holster. Go ahead and roll damage. What's the damage on that pistol? Holy shit. Six. Professor Horse Green, Bone shards from your knee are now sticking up out of the dirt as blood just begins spurting a fountain of blood away from your leg out onto this dusty ground beneath you. How many hit points did you have total? Yeah, so I'm going to need a constitution check there to stay conscious, buddy. Horse Green instantly collapses unconscious as he bleeds out on the ground.
627.04 629.04 speaker2  Oh shit.
628.04 636.84 speaker0  Damn. Holy shit.
636.00 658.16 speaker2  What? than I thought tonight. He's been practicing with Red Dead, but only using the bow and arrow.
656.08 665.52 speaker0  Judge F from Courtland, it is your turn.
662.28 682.72 speaker2  and I just hear a scream and I turn around and I see her like hunched over. So I'm like within an arm's reach of my horse. So I grabbed my lasso off the horse and try to get her with the lasso,
681.32 687.92 speaker0  Roll rope use for me.
687.08 723.72 speaker2  Oof. Oh shit, my internet just went out. Yeah, we're gonna have to do it again. Yeah, we're gonna have to do all live from the get go. So as I hear the scream, I turn around, grab the lasso and throw the lasso, but I had forgotten to tie the rope into a lasso. So I just threw the end of a rope at her.
720.52 762.60 speaker0  So the end of a rope hits her in the shoulder and it's a heavy rope and she grabs on to the other end of the rope. Just failed a sanity check. A sanity check that I forgot to have all of you roll, which you'll need to roll now.
761.48 771.80 speaker2  Welcome to the party, baby. Crit success. There you go. Okay, I got a normal success.
770.96 787.84 speaker0  Oh my God. Not sure how, not sure why.
785.56 793.28 speaker2  She's just wild with fear.
789.96 815.04 speaker0  because the success is still losing one sanity on this one. That is my apologies. Judge Ephraim Courtland, you're going to lose zero sanity with the full disregard that you have for all humans.
813.16 823.84 speaker2  Honestly, those smashed up watermelons made me feel worse than this.
821.64 856.04 speaker0  in this short arc. Jack Perlman, you're gonna lose a D4 plus one, except for with a crit fail, that D4 is automatically a four, which means that you lose five sanity, which just happens to be enough for you to have a short bout of insanity. So this is the thing where I'm gonna have you rank, fight, flight, or freeze from most likely to least likely.
853.16 858.48 speaker2  Fight, freeze, flight, most likely fight.
856.08 897.44 speaker0  If you roll a one, you're gonna run away. If you roll a two or a three, you're gonna freeze for one round, and if you roll four, five, six, you will immediately fight, That'll be a freeze. Perfect. So Jack Perlman, on your turn, You're gonna do what future Sheriff Dr. Bobby Custard is doing, which is... Everett Pace, it is your turn.
895.04 939.36 speaker2  She grabbed onto it, so she's still holding it onto her end, and he's holding onto his end, right? That is correct, yes. I wanna grab the rope anywhere that I can to pull as hard as I can, the purpose being to have her fall on her face. Sounds good. I pass a 23 on a 50.
936.64 949.88 speaker0  the rope goes completely taut, and she's looking directly at you with these wild, wild eyes.
948.16 972.68 speaker2  Son, I ain't got none of that. A 96 on a 10. Would that help me? You've seen a feral possum.
968.36 998.20 speaker0  These eyes, this sick combination of fear, loathing, and pure rage of needing to survive. and I'm sure other things. Oh, I'm sorry. And with that...
997.08 1007.44 speaker2  Feral skunks. It's Jack Perlmanster.
1004.92 1015.44 speaker0  No, I just want you to tell me... Will Ferrell? Yeah, just talk to me
1012.72 1050.88 speaker2  So inside of Jack's brain, he's been beaten down just sanity-wise over and over and over again from the get-go, because I think I failed every sanity roll this time. But he's just hit the breaking point where it's like the rubber band of stress has been stretched too much, and it snapped. And when it snapped, he just, he can't do anything. He doesn't know how to put it back together and do something that's useful right now. Paralyzed. I'm paralyzed with fear, baby. He says to Everett.
1049.64 1055.32 speaker1  Hey, Everett, I can't move.
1052.92 1056.96 speaker2  And as those thoughts are going through your brain,
1055.32 1127.76 speaker0  out of the corner of your eye, you see Tilde be this crazed teenage girl in a complete bout of madness in her own right, drops the rope and lunges directly at your neck. Unable to respond, she doesn't even try to pin you. She just like, mouth first, goes straight to your neck. She misses the jugular. She goes around the side, almost behind your ear, and bites down. You're gonna lose four damage. As she bites down to where her teeth, top and bottom, touch, and then she rips her head back. Blood begins pouring down, and you feel the shirt on your back become wet with thick, hot Jack Pearlman blood juice. And she begins chewing.
1125.12 1158.36 speaker2  and kind of, you know, loses all of the tension. And the opium is really starting to hit the judge right now combined with all the whiskey he's drank. So he- I forgot about that. He starts to nod off a little bit and then wakes up and just starts to coil the rope back and then takes a swig of whiskey and just lackadaisically starts tying it into an actual lasso. Okay. Unaware of what's happening to Jack.
1155.96 1252.78 speaker0  Horace Green is now on the ground. Jack Pearlman is standing there with part of his shoulder neck. His traps are missing on one side a little bit. And blood gushing down his shirt. Judge Ephraim Courtland staring off into the distance, coiling up his lasso and ever at pace, holding on to the other end of that there rope. Silas Cole stands up from his position, still handcuffed, and begins making his way toward the front door of the house and he gets up onto the porch before it is Bobby Custard's turn, who immediately turns. And with that notices, Tildy B takes his attention off of Silas and is going to fire at Tildy B. Mitchell. Yeah. Fires three rounds into Tildy B. Mitchell's chest, who staggers backwards and lets out another. that is clearly the cut of another time. I don't know how many different ways I can say that.
1250.88 1273.54 speaker2  What is Forever 21? and throw it toward her feet. I'm trying to bait her, so I'm saying things like,
1271.18 1277.00 speaker1  Here, here, take some of this, take some of this.
1276.16 1289.62 speaker2  onto the ground in front of her.
1286.38 1297.82 speaker0  Okay, I bet you don't have charm. So let's have you roll.
1295.78 1324.26 speaker2  every week on PTBP. And if you run into a feral possum, it's handy to have some watermelon in your pocket to feed it to get its attention away from you while you get away.
1322.06 1331.34 speaker1  You could just do that for us real quick.
1328.68 1334.62 speaker0  Okay, roll farming.
1333.78 1347.40 speaker2  I pass. It's a 41 out of 60.
1345.30 1353.14 speaker0  you possibly could have.
1350.50 1358.90 speaker2  For an animal, oh my God.
1356.18 1363.46 speaker0  on this dusty, dusty ground.
1360.70 1367.82 speaker2  That's how well it's landed in this ground.
1366.18 1382.28 speaker0  Yeah, no matter what happens, whether I remember to or not, the epilogue of this story is the growth of watermelons next year.
1380.98 1398.84 speaker2  and start getting out of there. It's a distraction. So I'm walking back toward the horses. Can our next arc be like going inside one of the characters cause he swallowed a watermelon seed
1398.02 1410.08 speaker0  Yes. Watermelon seeds. Are you trying to sneak away
1409.20 1422.20 speaker2  Just kind of walking, hoping that I distracted her enough that her attention is not on me. Okay. But I don't have stealth.
1419.80 1436.52 speaker0  There wasn't a lot to hide behind anyway. No big rocks.
1435.12 1470.12 speaker2  That's what it feels like as I put my hand over what used to be part of my neck and shoulder. And now I assume it's like a donut. Like when you take just a single or like a bagel and it's that perfectly round bite, Justin does.
1468.12 1474.56 speaker1  Oh, I crit failed again.
1473.12 1475.40 speaker2  with the bite I'm assuming?
1474.56 1482.84 speaker1  I'm like, whoa.
1477.84 1495.96 speaker0  And then as soon as she rips the muscle up out of your neck, Back to reality. Back to reality.
1492.60 1506.26 speaker2  is she like real fast and kind of like spindly and wiry? and like hold her down on the ground?
1505.44 1507.10 speaker0  Okay.
1506.26 1513.30 speaker2  Shove her face in that watermelon. I have fighting brawl or strength, I don't know.
1511.78 1515.82 speaker0  that I would like you to roll against me on.
1514.14 1529.36 speaker2  And yeah, I basically want to just like grapple her to the ground and kind of like hold on to her, but in a position where I cannot be bit, like. I got a 10. Yeah.
1528.22 1597.24 speaker0  Yeah, that'll do. That'll do. So for a pin, no damage will be dealt to her, but you are now pinning her, which gives her a negative and you a positive on your next rolls and her a negative on any opposing rolls. You're moving forward. However, as you have her pinned to the ground, you look around you. Right next to you on the ground, you see Professor Horace Green, who just lost another hit point this round. Four. Oh shit. Damn. Everett Pace, who is slowly backing away from the entire situation. Silas Cole, who is on the porch of the house, heading into his home, hopefully. Preacher Sheriff Bobby Custard, who is gun drawn looking around. So he seems to be a good ally here. And Judge Ephraim Courtland, who seems to not care so much about all this, care far more about getting his rope
1594.16 1614.68 speaker2  He's walking away from me. that opium is a natural painkiller, so if that can help in any way. And he smoked some of it.
1613.28 1620.24 speaker0  Yeah, no, he can't feel it. You like that?
1618.60 1746.44 speaker2  He can't feel that he's dying. High and low. Thank God he hit that 10, though. That gives us a moment. That's when the dogs were getting here, so I couldn't hear. Did she attack you first and then you did it? so he preemptively shot. Yeah, I tried to shoot at her and just blew my knee off. I thought she'd like crit attacked you or something like that in success. That's crazy. Good old crit fail. Always fun. It was a hundred, too. It was the crittest of fails. following a day of drinking and roaming around in Mexico. While sipping his tequila, he noticed a sizzling scrumptious looking platter being served at the next table. Not only did it look good, but the smell was wonderful. He asked the waiter, what is that you just served? The waiter replied, ah, you have excellent taste. Those are bull testicles from the bullfight this morning. Delicacy. The cowboy undaunted said, what the heck? I'm on vacation. I'll have some. The waiter replied, I'm so sorry. There's only one serving per day because there's only one bullfight each morning. If you place your order now, we'll be sure to save you the delicacy for tomorrow. The cowboy placed the order and the next evening, he was served the one and only special delicacy of the day. After a few bites and inspecting the contents of his platter, he called to the waiter and said, these are delicious, but they're quite a bit smaller than the ones I saw you serve yesterday. The waiter shrugged his shoulders and replied, sometimes the bull wins. So it was like he ate the person's balls. If only he'd been there a day earlier, he could have gotten the bull's testicles that he wanted.
1743.68 1750.40 speaker1  Yeah, that's actually more of a dramatic tale that you told us.
1747.28 1784.56 speaker2  A cowboy asked me if I could help him round up 18 cows. I said, sure, that's 20 cows.
1779.56 1805.48 speaker0  Jack Perlman is thrown at least four feet in the air Roll sanity. Okay.
1804.64 1832.64 speaker1  Fail. No.
1829.08 1856.28 speaker2  After the judge gets his rope coiled up, he notices that Silas is not on the ground by him anymore and catches him out of the corner of his eye and sees him running off towards his house. And he's going to drop the rope
1854.68 1884.12 speaker0  Character sheet here. Climb for climbing stairs. Drive wagon coach, which is what everybody in town calls your fat ass. I'm not seeing anything. So I'll have your old dexterity.
1883.28 1886.00 speaker2  39.
1885.16 1908.24 speaker0  Damn. Gotcha, baby. Judge F from Courtland's this big lumbering creature, almost as horrifying as Tildy B. Mitchell. And he makes it right up onto the stairs as Silas Cole slams the door directly in his face.
1905.92 1917.32 speaker2  and just kind of like blinks hard and looks
1916.28 1978.20 speaker0  Save us all. Actually, let's see who's going to roll this for me. Joe, you can roll it. Roll a D six. If you roll a one, two or three, he's going to shoot Tildy B. Mitchell. If you roll four, five or six, he's going to start giving first aid to Professor Horse Green. It's a four. Right next to his bag, he grabs his medicine bag out of his side saddle there, part of his tack. Nice. Maybe, I don't know. And he rushes to Horse Green Horse Green, conscious again, you gain three hit points.
1977.36 1989.92 speaker1  Ah! Ah! Help me!
1987.64 2006.42 speaker2  So she's devouring this watermelon and she's just all about the watermelon right now, right? She's scrambling over toward it.
2005.24 2012.64 speaker0  so you know she's a fan.
2010.04 2024.84 speaker2  to grab the rifle out of the side saddle there. Smart. Can I get there in time and shoot or do I just get there? Yeah, you don't know her name.
2024.00 2041.54 speaker0  And she screams, Ah! Ah!
2040.36 2051.04 speaker2  Oh, I can push. So I rolled a 77. That would be a crit fail on a 70. I'm gonna push this roll. I forgot about pushing.
2049.62 2053.80 speaker0  You can't push. Oh, a fucking crit.
2052.40 2096.24 speaker2  God damn it. Our dice are cursed tonight. Fuck. All right, yeah. That was a crit fail with a... Roll damage for me. Ooh. Four, so eight total. Eight total?
2093.66 2121.08 speaker0  Professor Horace Green, the first thing you see actually when you open your eyes and start screaming once you've come back to reality a little bit, the front of Preacher Sheriff, Dr. Bobby Custard's torso, just on his left side, explodes through and viscera and awful just starts kind of pouring out the front of him.
2118.48 2139.44 speaker2  It's like you threw a crispy. Let's just keep going. Whose turn is it now?
2134.72 2150.88 speaker0  Dr. Bobby Custard grabs almost the entire thing of gauze in his pack and shoves it like a fistful just right into his own gut.
2148.12 2158.80 speaker1  Jack Pearlman gets his knife out. He's going for blood.
2156.20 2161.08 speaker2  whatever, whatever works, whatever you think works.
2159.96 2168.44 speaker1  Stab, swipe.
2165.48 2170.68 speaker0  Unless you have a knife skill that's different than that.
2168.44 2183.24 speaker1  The knife is brawl skill. Oh, that's cool. Well, I failed, so 72 on a 60.
2182.40 2200.96 speaker0  Oh, always. that's just kind of how it works. If she was to fight against one of you guys and you could fight back, you'd take a negative that round as well.
2198.92 2219.40 speaker1  But then if I do fail, I crit fail. Yeah, that is correct. I'm going for it. Right guys, right?
2215.56 2228.32 speaker0  like bends back, dodging all of your side swipes. What are you doing to try to?
2226.76 2234.28 speaker2  and he's swiping like that. And then as he misses one of his swipes,
2233.16 2237.88 speaker0  The American plunge.
2236.56 2255.68 speaker1  Well, yeah. So two D4 plus two.
2254.84 2272.60 speaker0  The knife has a damage bonus.
2271.76 2273.44 speaker1  So five?
2272.60 2280.00 speaker0  Yeah, five. That's still not great. How many hit points did you have?
2279.16 2281.92 speaker1  What did you start with? 14.
2280.84 2304.08 speaker0  Holy shit, okay. You had 10, now you have five. Taking half of your current hit points in one round. I'm going to need a constitution check for you, Jack Perlman, and you've been doing nothing but rolling great this entire time. So I'm sure you'll have no issues staying conscious. Joe.
2303.24 2308.84 speaker1  Oops.
2308.00 2309.68 speaker3  Wait a minute.
2308.84 2316.28 speaker1  No. A 10.
2315.44 2322.44 speaker2  Wait, what did you tell me to roll? No, that's great.
2321.16 2336.12 speaker0  So you can stay conscious. That was a constitution check in order to stay conscious. However, your knife is directly in between the two bones in your femur. Nope, femur's one bone. Tibia and fibula.
2335.12 2339.16 speaker2  What's the bone right next to the femur?
2338.00 2342.00 speaker1  I stabbed my PP.
2341.16 2347.72 speaker0  Is that your thigh? That might be in your arm. No, that's your leg.
2346.72 2350.36 speaker2  I broke them bad boys.
2349.44 2355.64 speaker1  It's in my leg.
2353.08 2389.60 speaker0  up against your femur. You think that if you were to pull out your femur bone and look at it, it would have Tildi B's initials on it. It's completely dug in there. And she helped guide it away from her and right back directly into your leg. And it is stuck there.
2387.64 2399.64 speaker1  Am I still losing hit points?
2397.84 2424.80 speaker0  If you'd like to roll firearms.
2423.96 2439.08 speaker1  Yeah. Yeah, I failed.
2437.08 2442.28 speaker0  And what does he do, Zach?
2441.44 2447.36 speaker3  Oh, no.
2445.08 2452.92 speaker0  Who is just giving you first aid.
2451.56 2459.68 speaker2  Bubby.
2455.80 2572.60 speaker0  to point at the unnatural creature tearing apart Jack Pearlman with his own turns, you fire the pistol on its way down. Go ahead and roll damage for me. Oh, boy. It's 11. Oh, my god. most famous, most infamous gunfight probably of the West, happened in Tombstone in 1881? People always think of it as this, you know, Tombstone, right? Big gunfight. Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday. It only lasted 30 seconds, which is five rounds of this game. And we're at the end of round three currently. Yeah. and his body flies off in a completely different direction than where you actually shot? Quentin Tarantino style? Yeah, no. He flies into the back of the wagon. His headless body is just flung. since I didn't see it. No, not you. You feel like Cotton.
2570.80 2586.64 speaker3  My god, dude.
2585.48 2589.80 speaker1  Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly right.
2588.36 2594.68 speaker2  I regular failed.
2592.28 2598.28 speaker0  Jack Perlman knew it would lose two sanity.
2597.24 2606.72 speaker3  I pass. Loses no sanity.
2602.84 2619.20 speaker1  And it blasted the wrong way, so he didn't even see it.
2614.72 2682.20 speaker0  Here's a noise that sounds like, no, as it's happening. And honestly, that noise is coming out of these vocal cords that are hanging out the top of this body, just waggling back and forth in the arid wind. And you assume that that noise is Tildy B. Mitchell, killed just now. However, at the top of this round, you all see Tildy B releases the knife that is in Jack Perlman's thigh and begins running as fast as she can. Away? Away. Oh. She runs around the backside of the house. And she actually runs so far in this round. This is a six-second round. She makes it about 75 yards.
2678.56 2708.00 speaker1  That's the son of a bitch what killed Dandelion. I yell to no one in particular.
2706.96 2711.28 speaker2  Thin door.
2710.28 2808.36 speaker0  take their headphones off. is the first thing you notice when you kick in the front door of the coal abode. At first, you think the stench could be from the unattended dishes strewn throughout this living room, the ruminants of several meals now covered in a few buzzing flies. But that static hum of these buzzing around flies is so loud in your ears due to the large swarm hovering above and about the body of Miss Kitty, which is laying lifeless across one of the sitting chairs. Lifeless, to be sure, because this body, the skin is chewed up so badly that chunks are hanging off or completely missing the dripping dark red blood pooling below on the floor, but especially lifeless due to the way this body is crumpled. Her back held directly in the middle by one of the armrests dangles straight down perpendicular to the floor.
2804.40 2829.60 speaker2  A 50 on a 50. I'm going in. Can I see Silas or?
2827.84 2836.84 speaker0  So this is a shotgun style house. So basically front door leads to the first room and there's one door all the way ahead of you.
2835.64 2852.88 speaker2  I'm going to keep going. I want to find Silas. Is it a closed door? It's not like an archway.
2852.40 2871.52 speaker3  Awesome.
2867.96 2896.48 speaker0  takes off into the distance, Judge Courtland kicks in the door of the Silas home, takes in his surroundings before you hear, So many people on this list are dead now.
2894.48 2909.56 speaker2  kind of given whatever kind of cover I can if somebody comes out that front door. But I want to be making my way to whoever looks most injured between Jack and Horace. I could visually tell that, couldn't I?
2908.16 2912.44 speaker0  Jack, what are your hit points at?
2911.92 2971.20 speaker2  Three. I'm going to head over to Professor Horace and try and do a little first aid on him. That cool? It's a crit pass, a 66 on a 70. He just dropped all his medical supplies right there on the ground. I reached down and grabbed with one hand some gauze and just like patted it into the knee area. And I've done it a lot. Living out there on the land by myself, I had to patch up myself all the time. So I'm real good at it. And I keep one gun trained on the door, my rifle, and the crook of my elbow here while I get his knee back in tip top shape. Perlin.
2970.72 2993.84 speaker1  What? My thigh. My thigh. I want to rip off a chunk of my shirt with my teeth and tear it up and then wrap it real tight.
2990.80 2997.32 speaker0  It perfectly cuts into a cute little crop top.
2993.84 3042.24 speaker1  Oh, yeah, I do from the tummy, not from my sleeve. Yeah, I do the tummy cloth, not the arm. of a long sleeve crop top. Yeah, great. I'm going to push it.
3041.32 3044.80 speaker0  What's your first aid?
3043.88 3051.20 speaker2  Oh, shit. It's 50-50.
3049.44 3083.52 speaker1  Let's see what happens. Wait, hold on. Yeah, yeah. What is happening? That's good.
3082.12 3102.36 speaker0  doesn't stop the bleeding. And so you think to yourself, well, obviously I've got to get this knife out. And so you grab onto the handle of your knife. Oh, OK. Did I say she ran off with it? I think you might have. I thought you did. I thought you said she took it out.
3100.76 3116.16 speaker2  At some specific point, you did say she dropped your knife, his knife. I don't know if it was still in his leg when that happened or not.
3111.56 3159.56 speaker0  and then she let go and released it so that she could bail, but just left it in his leg. She doesn't need a knife. She got chompy chompies. And as you pull it out, it nicks an artery, and blood just starts going everywhere as you're desperately trying to tie tighter and tighter this shirt bottom around your leg. And you lose four hit points. check to stay conscious. Joe?
3156.84 3198.08 speaker2  if you crit fail a first aid roll, just don't do it, Justin.
3195.68 3202.00 speaker1  God damn it.
3200.04 3234.56 speaker0  to the point of non-return. We are. Oh, with Sylas. How much mobility do I have? Mechanically, you're going to be at a disadvantage on anything that needs you to run or be dexterous or anything like that. But you can hobble. So you're just as good as Everett Pace was always.
3232.64 3239.64 speaker2  I think I just got to your position.
3236.28 3293.68 speaker0  in this location, which I'm picturing about 10 yards away from the front porch of the Cole home. You guys are right out front. in the living room. Just a reminder that he was in the first room of this house no, you failed your listen check. So you're just kicking in the next door? Oh, you're just going to open it? If it is open. Describe to me exactly what you do.
3291.88 3306.56 speaker2  You know what, I'm pissed off and I'm big. So after I'm yelling, get your ass out here, I kick in the other door, the next door.
3305.08 3318.32 speaker0  two separate rolls. Listen first.
3313.32 3326.84 speaker2  Crit success on the spot hit 33 on him.
3321.12 3350.44 speaker0  As you kick in the door, you find yourself in the bedroom. The bed has been completely flipped over to use as cover on the right side of this room. And you see a small one inch in diameter metal sphere rolling directly toward you.
3349.28 3369.64 speaker2  pay any attention to it. Yeah, it's like a marble. So I'm going to be careful not to slip on it, but I'm going to go and just brute force grab the mattress and throw it away to see if he's behind there.
3365.96 3395.08 speaker0  throw it right up against the wall to your side. And you see Silas Cole, he's hunkered down and he is chanting something quietly to himself.
3391.80 3404.68 speaker2  My left hand, I grab one of the belts he's wearing and I just lift him up over my head.
3403.00 3565.60 speaker0  on the back of your neck. And we, me and you, Luke, we see Judge Ephraim Courtland freeze. Multiple shiny limbs extend from the small metal sphere and slam into the wooden floor beneath you, giving it the leverage it needs to shove down as one of its appendages slices into the soft tissue on the back of Judge Ephraim Courtland's neck. as a third metal tendril reaches in, gripping the top of Judge Courtland's spine where it meets his head, the C1 vertebrae, and it rips his entire spinal cord out of his body in one swift motion, promptly forcing itself Hell yeah. So your goal is to make sure that there are no witnesses to what has happened here on the property today. There are a couple ways you can do this. You would be able to keep the body of Judge Courtland if you wanted to do that and then control Courtland whenever you wanted to around town. It might be kind of tricky at this point. M-A-R-Y typically likes to only control and then other people that she can use for outside towns. However, the judge would be a... that also works in your advantage, but you typically don't want it. because then they'll know the secret, and if they get away having known that, then you're fucked. The third way is that Silas Cole, you know now, that Silas Cole is chanting and will continue to chant the spell that after a couple rounds will open up a portal in the floor of this room, the middle room of this house. You know that there is a back room, which is the kitchen, a front room, which is the living room, and then the middle room, which is your guys' bedroom, and the portal can be in front of both doors on one side of the room.
3564.52 3573.40 speaker2  And it's in the bedroom?
3572.56 3585.64 speaker0  Okay, sweet. So those are your options. so I'm gonna let them choose what happens next.
3583.68 3585.64 speaker2  Oh shit, how long have we been playing? ["Get Your Head Around My Poor Little Darling"]
