0.00 254.10 speaker0  What is crackin' my babies? Answer, my bones. Constantly. It's your bone daddy Wolf the dog, here to delight and fright as I hit you with the news both past and present from 694.2 PTBP. This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from at witch.hazels on Instagram, who created a stellar piece of art depicting Sharon Shadow Berryman, Liz Lonklin, and Judy Krenkelhoff. Seriously, go check it out. They right. Hi, Mr. The Dog. Hazel and Pals here. Sorry we had to send this message by Raven. They're basically rats where we're from. So why not catch one and convince it to be an errand boy? Just wanted to thank y'all for consistently putting out amazing content. The show got me through a hard time this year. Let's my group of cucks and I share endless laughs and spooks, and inspires us in our own tabletop misadventures. Mini-cacophonous Howls, Hazel, Alia, Britt, Flynn, Gabby, and Liam. Haha, please. My father was Mr. The Dog. You can simply call me Wolf... The Dog. I have an unkindness of ravens constantly circling my general area. Maybe they can smell the death on me and mine. But who knows? I'm glad we can put out something that can fright and excite you simultaneously, Hazel. Remember, if you want to write up something for your wolf to how, tag at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter, tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook, or write a five-star review on iTunes and email us at PretendingPod at Gmail.com. Fuck Mark Zuckerberg, that insatiable invertebrate. And the dudes from PretendingToBePeople want me to remind you they are accepting questions for a third Q&A episode. There's also a post in the subreddit where you can comment your questions. Similar to the second Q&A episode, this one will be exclusive for our honorary police officers over on Patreon, who keep this show alive five bucks a month at a time. Those beautiful people who hold that dirty title currently have access to six exclusive bonus episodes, and that number is growing each month. The PTBP crew will answer some of the questions they don't get to in the Q&A session right there on the internet. Maybe your question will be one of them. In which case, you probably want me to shut the fuck up and deliver the news. Let's get right back into the business. It's Blue False Indigo with Moondance. She runs. Ooh.
249.10 358.10 speaker2  She knows. That the time has come. To dance beneath the, dance beneath the shadow of the moon. Ash Hornbeam. It's completely dark outside, and it's pouring down raining. You are only seeing where your feet are taking you, splashing in all this mud by the moonlight, and the pretty consistent lightning flashes illuminating everything around you. You make your way onto the trail and continue running. Judy! Yeah. I grab her by the arm, and, uh, I just hold onto her, and I bring her with me, and I'm like, I start running down the trail. Is this the trail that leads to the campsite? Yes.
357.10 373.10 speaker0  You arrive at the campsite.
359.10 412.10 speaker2  Fire was never made, so it's kind of hard to tell where it is, but you see, getting soaked by the rain are your bags and everyone's gear that was brought into the woods with you. Do I see the naked man? I look at Judy.
409.10 437.10 speaker1  He fell through the... He fell through the earth. I saw it happen. He just disappeared.
431.10 471.10 speaker2  You see there's hand sanitizer sitting on the... I don't know if you wanted to use it. No. Clean off your hands. When Judy pats Ash on the back, he throws up like a burped child.
470.10 509.10 speaker1  Hands on the ground. Then I go back to look for some more rocks, and I'm like, I'm really nervous about you. You seem to be acting really weird.
502.10 688.10 speaker2  He starts to think about just what he's seen in the past minute and a half, two minutes. You're trying to hurt me? So you're going to roll 1d6 for damage. I'm hit in the head with a rock. I'm kind of spun around to where I fall on my back facing Judy, and the last thought before my lights go out is, every girl I've ever liked has hurt me. Hey. It's dark, man.
685.10 729.10 speaker1  Shit. Can I tell the voice that was yelling?
722.10 813.10 speaker2  And it doesn't seem to matter as you get your head up into the room, as the room is empty. This is not the inside of a cabin. This is a lab. Okay. All around the room, there are these same tubes that are translucent, and filling them all is this black liquid substance that is oozing through the tubes and going down into the floorboards. And there are these like coffin-shaped boxes. It is. It is completely lit by lights. Just as a normal cabin would be, it's got electric to it and a lot of like white light, like laboratory lighting, right? Yeah. And I think as you get up into the cabin and start looking around, you would also see there is a wooden trunk. A large wooden trunk up against the wall. And there is a desk with papers littered all over it.
807.10 859.10 speaker1  Is there maybe a brand on the machines or is there signage on the walls like, wear your lab coat or anything like that? You hear a...
846.10 902.10 speaker2  Out the window and looking out the front window of this cabin, you see Liz Lonklin and Jeremy Pettymore on the other side of a moat that is outside this cabin. Seemingly surrounding it about five feet wide. And on the other side, Jeremy Pettymore and Liz Lonklin are running and you look over at the exact moment. Liz Lonklin stops dead in her tracks. A massive metal claw from a branch on a tree right above her swings down, decapitating her. Oh no! And blood just spurts and squirts. Like when you're peeing after you had sex and it just goes everywhere. Uh huh. That's the blood coming out of Liz Lonklin's body.
900.10 924.10 speaker1  I do it specifically for each person. Oh fuck. Oh my god, I pass a six on a 29.
923.10 926.10 speaker2  That didn't happen.
925.10 938.10 speaker1  There's no way that happened. It's trying to scare me. After that happens, what's Jeremy doing? Where's the last place I've seen you?
935.10 939.10 speaker2  He's gone. He dipped. He just kept running.
938.10 980.10 speaker1  Oh god. He just kept running. Oh my god. Okay.
979.10 1009.10 speaker2  Oh my god. And looking at the plans, it seems to have been recently completed. There are also plans for small metal spheres, one inch in diameter. And looking at the plans, it seems that they are being put into small human bodies.
1005.10 1028.10 speaker1  I take a weary glance at the three feet long coffins. Uh-huh. Can I go through the drawers of the desk? Sure. I just want to see if I can find anything.
1026.10 1038.10 speaker2  Okay, roll search for me.
1036.10 1046.10 speaker1  Don't pass. A 97 on a 50.
1042.10 1059.10 speaker2  You're just looking over these plans in a very broad, vague sense.
1058.10 1071.10 speaker1  Yes. And it's kind of by the window that I just saw terrible things happen? Yes.
1070.10 1090.10 speaker2  Okay. Being surrounded by the moat. And it is smaller than this cabin and the door is open and there's a light coming out of it.
1088.10 1116.10 speaker1  Can I see, does it open in any way? I want to open it. But if it's opaque, I guess I'm going to open it. It is opaque. I'm opening it.
1111.10 1160.10 speaker2  Roll dexterity to see how quickly this happens. You open up this coffin and this black viscous, sludgy, oily goo starts pouring up out of it, all over the table that it's on, and then onto the floor. And you get out of the way just in time to not touch any of this, but it is starting to spread throughout. And as it dissipates out of this coffin, you see that inside the coffin, there is a two-year-old body.
1159.10 1170.10 speaker1  Wow.
1164.10 1182.10 speaker2  So picture a face with a plastic bag over it, that's what this face looks like.
1181.10 1224.10 speaker1  Okay. Then I am going to run out the front door. And when I say run out the front door, I am panicking running to the front door, but when I get to the door, I want to try and gingerly open and close it behind me.
1220.10 1247.10 speaker2  And the dark night sky is being lit by the moon. And all these lightning flashes that keep illuminating everything around you. You've seen so much shit tonight that every single time lightning flashes, you think you see something off in the woods. And then eventually you do see a figure walking toward you. And it is Judy Krinklehoff, the older sister of Ken Krinklehoff.
1245.10 1276.10 speaker1  Judy, where the fuck did you come from? I was just walking in the woods and I saw you and you're running and your clothes are all cattywampus and I don't know what to do. No, they ran away and they left me. The shack up at the front by the parking lot. The parking lot? We should go back there.
1275.10 1300.10 speaker2  I guess. You're like three years older than me and at this point in our life cycles that's like,
1293.10 1357.10 speaker1  Like you are significantly larger than me so if somebody tries to come and get us you could probably kill them first so can you please just go in front? Yeah.
1355.10 1384.10 speaker2  So are you stabbing? You're stabbing multiple times? Yeah, I'm stabbing. Okay, so we're going to roll melee. What is your melee? You're going to have a bonus. I have a 40. Plus 20. Oh, fuck.
1383.10 1424.10 speaker3  What the hell?
1422.10 1449.10 speaker2  Roll Sanity, Thomas. Jeremy Pettymore, what are you going to do? Run.
1447.10 1489.10 speaker3  Is this game boring? Run. Run. It's late.
1488.10 1500.10 speaker1  I never sang it for you. That's awesome.
1493.10 1525.10 speaker2  Ken Krenkelhoff walks out of the cabin, out of the front door, onto the front porch. It's dark. Two of them have black ties and one is wearing a bolo tie.
1524.10 1534.10 speaker1  Obviously.
1529.10 1561.10 speaker2  The man with the bolo, shorter, pants pretty tight. He's got a thick mustache. And then the third is a woman and she is smiling. A cold, vacant smile behind asymmetrical bangs.
1559.10 1596.10 speaker1  Are they inside the moat perimeter? I want to get away from that. That's creepy chanting, lady. 61 on a 35.
1589.10 1625.10 speaker2  your hand phases into the door and you feel a slight push behind you. And your body moves toward and into the door of the cabin. Wood fills your body as the thoughts in your mind go out of existence
1623.10 1644.10 speaker3  Yep. Holy fuck.
1638.10 1727.10 speaker2  As soon as they come in, one of them starts yelling about the ooze that is all over the floor. Another one grabs a bucket and runs out to the moat, comes back in with a bucket full of water, and splashes it on the ooze, pushing it backward. Two of them grab the trunk and they leave. One of them comes back in. It's the woman, and she starts chanting again, and the entire place begins to light up in flames. Ken Krenkelhoff dies burning as part of the cabin in these contention woods. Yeah, he is. Are you going to stop by your campsite before you bail to grab your bag of things?
1720.10 1741.10 speaker3  He's seen Ken disappear, Ash is apparently stuck in a tree somewhere that no one could find, so he is just fucking booking it back to the ranger station.
1737.10 1794.10 speaker2  like a streetlight on the parking lot. It's flickering. Rain is torrential downpour at this point. You are completely soaked. You've got some blood on your shoes from where Judy Krenkelhoff fell on that machete, and it splattered out onto you, and it's probably washed off with the mud and the wet at this point, but you see from the moonlight shining down a reflection on all this water that's pouring from the sky, and the lightning strikes are illuminating everything around you. You're all alone in the parking lot, and you see there's the car, the notice on the driver's side window. and when you go to turn it over...
1793.10 1819.10 speaker3  Yeah. Give me a roll. Okay. I don't know what that should be, but... Oh, driving. But naturally, on your page, you have a 20% drive. And you rolled? A 27. Yeah.
1818.10 1821.10 speaker2  Fucks.
1820.10 1824.10 speaker3  Fucks. So he doesn't know how to start a car. When you go to...
1823.10 1834.10 speaker2  It's just dead. There's a point to where something is wrong. Either the battery's dead, like literally no lights are coming on when you turn the car over.
1831.10 1843.10 speaker3  I get out of it and I start running down the road towards town.
1842.10 1901.10 speaker2  I'm going to get ashed. They're going over the top of you creating a sort of canopy. And the camera is down low, like on the ground. As you're running off into the distance. And then we see a black sedan driving incredibly furiously come over the top of the camera. And behind it, a four-wheeler. And as they approach, the four-wheeler overtakes the black sedan and rolls up next to you as you're running. And you look over, and riding this four-wheeler is a man. Pretty fit. Early 40s. He's wearing a black suit with a white shirt and a bolo tie. And he has a fucking badass mustache. And you recognize it as John Lee Pettymore the Third. Your second cousin.
1899.10 1903.10 speaker3  I want to hop on the four-wheeler.
1902.10 1907.10 speaker1  John! Uncle John!
1905.10 1914.10 speaker2  He stops the four-wheeler. And he sees you. And his heart sinks. And you can see it in his eyes.
1912.10 1918.10 speaker3  Thank God you're here.
1916.10 1966.10 speaker2  And he lifts up a pistol.
1965.10 2077.10 speaker0  She knows.
2076.10 2078.10 speaker2  to Be People.
2077.10 2086.10 speaker3  Zach, what's wrong with your voice?
2081.10 2091.10 speaker1  They're back in the scrap pit.
2086.10 2133.10 speaker2  Justin's not here, but we figured we'd pop on in at the end of this episode. And we recently just said that we would take Q&As for a new Patreon episode that's coming out next month. And we figured we'd pop in here and answer a couple of the quickly asked answers on the subreddit. And we're going to take down a couple of them right now. So, Sky Spore, or Sky's por, or Sky's po ar asks, What do you all do when you're told to leave the room?
2131.10 2164.10 speaker1  I don't know what happens. He thinks that's how it works.
2161.10 2168.10 speaker3  So she's always making like dope smells in the kitchen.
2166.10 2169.10 speaker1  Every time we open the door, it walks in.
2168.10 2178.10 speaker3  Some awesome fucking barbecue chicken.
2177.10 2191.10 speaker2  Ew!
2188.10 2197.10 speaker3  That's the bitch I own for.
2195.10 2202.10 speaker2  but it's fucking terrible out now.
2199.10 2216.10 speaker3  Yeah, so the answer is we hang out with Taylor. Just kind of shit amongst ourselves. If there's multiple people back there, we will talk.
2212.10 2229.10 speaker1  So we shoot the shit and hang out because we see each other once a week this way. You signed the contract. I don't care. I don't fucking care.
2228.10 2234.10 speaker2  Right.
2233.10 2237.10 speaker3  Two cats. Nice sweet kitties.
2235.10 2239.10 speaker1  Tell them about your not so fat cat now.
2238.10 2312.10 speaker2  How big was she? Ropo was 35 pounds when we got her. So fucking insane. And she's short too. She's really short. She's not a long cat. And she was so cute. We had to get her, but I didn't want a diabetic cat. So we've been working out with her every day. She's really toning up her core. Honestly, mostly Ramona just chases her around and doesn't let her eat. So that's the diet that she's on. It's really worked. Yeah. What is she now? Oh, shit. Really? Wow. Yeah. It's super impressive. However, now she has this flap of skin that just drags the ground everywhere she goes. And she was never pregnant, I don't think. But fun story about Ropo. Her name was Roly Poly when we got her, and they shortened it to Ropo. But she was owned by a woman who took in lots of shelter animals. And when the woman died-
2310.10 2322.10 speaker3  Fucking clearly.
2315.10 2344.10 speaker2  And when they went into the house, they found I think she had eight cats and 13 dogs or something. And Ropo was hiding in the cabinet under the sink. Full of old lady face.
2342.10 2355.10 speaker3  Your cat is so fat. How fat is she?
2347.10 2376.10 speaker2  I did like the first night that we had Ropo, I woke up to her just like chewing on my cheek. It says, why is Luke so handsome?
2373.10 2392.10 speaker3  But now, look at me.
2390.10 2421.10 speaker2  M-A-L-I-D-O-R-I. It says, howdy everyone. Fellow Missourian here. What up, what up. I hope you're all staying nice and warm with the winter incoming fast. It is coming all over us. Speaking of staying warm, one, what is your all beverages of choice? They've been into Kraken Spiced Rum recently. Fall beverage of choice?
2418.10 2425.10 speaker1  Me and Thomas went through the Kraken phase. We used to bring that to parties all the time.
2422.10 2441.10 speaker3  Yeah, before we were 21.
2433.10 2463.10 speaker2  Also, that is exactly the viscosity level that I'm thinking when I talk about the ooze in this campaign. I like hot tea.
2461.10 2471.10 speaker3  That shit is fucking awesome.
2470.10 2497.10 speaker2  Oh, Jesus. Yeah, I drink way too much milk.
2496.10 2502.10 speaker4  Yeah, in real life.
2497.10 2520.10 speaker3  This is your wife puking for ten minutes after trying to make herself burp.
2519.10 2531.10 speaker1  Dude, the bubblies are way better. Because I hate them, but I've got to stop drinking soda. Yeah, bubbly's good and spindrift is good. I've been having good luck with those.
2527.10 2538.10 speaker4  What's the one that you said you bought it all or something? Spindrift.
2532.10 2554.10 speaker1  Spindrift, yeah. I've cleaned out the grocery store that is near me because nobody else is buying the spindrift there. I'm bumping up dim numbers.
2553.10 2555.10 speaker2  Wow.
2554.10 2557.10 speaker1  I just can't do that.
2556.10 2561.10 speaker3  You can see these two cans right next to me.
2560.10 2566.10 speaker2  I put lime juice and bitters in there.
2565.10 2572.10 speaker4  Peychaud's.
2571.10 2573.10 speaker3  Yes.
2572.10 2577.10 speaker2  Okay.
2574.10 2591.10 speaker3  Because a thing I really like is just water. Yeah. At the point, a thing I don't like is unflavored sparkling water.
2586.10 2599.10 speaker1  I drink a lot of water too. I'm trying to replace just the soda that I would also drink.
2598.10 2616.10 speaker4  Oh, that sucks. It does suck, but it also doesn't suck because I drink way more water now and pollute the ocean.
2611.10 2626.10 speaker1  Apparently that's bad for you. I guess it's still carcinogenic or something like that to reuse the water bottles.
2625.10 2650.10 speaker4  Lost Trail? Yeah, Fernette Baraka.
2646.10 2661.10 speaker1  I'm a beer guy in general, but I also always have a bottle of whiskey at the house.
2657.10 2699.10 speaker2  Oh man, that with a shot of espresso next to each other? Baby, baby. Nice. I mean, we tag Bell's in a lot of pictures where we're drinking Two-Hearted, but the recent picture from Halloween. Yeah. Pretty great picture. Nice.
2690.10 2705.10 speaker3  Yeah, you only see my bottom layer and the wife beater shirt that I ripped in half.
2704.10 2711.10 speaker1  You look great.
2710.10 2733.10 speaker4  Natural Brew. Natural Brew, dog.
2725.10 2735.10 speaker2  There are honorary police officers of the Pretending to Be People Patreon, and we are so fucking grateful for them. Thank you.
2734.10 2738.10 speaker3  Jesus.
2737.10 2743.10 speaker2  Seriously.
2738.10 2768.10 speaker3  Don't forget about that and up, by the way.
2767.10 2781.10 speaker2  Really, really cool.
2780.10 2789.10 speaker3  Basement Cats. Straight up.
2786.10 2798.10 speaker2  And all three of them really knocked it out of the park. I was so stoked to have them be a part of this little adventure that we made together.
2797.10 2804.10 speaker1  Yeah.
2802.10 2810.10 speaker3  So that was a lot of fun to listen to. Super fun. And spooky.
2807.10 2822.10 speaker4  It also just makes it way much more fun that it is closed because you get to record and then every week you get to find out a little more of what was going on.
2816.10 2833.10 speaker2  I was really nervous actually about running six PCs in one area, but I think everyone had a pretty good time and it turned out sick. I'm really happy with the end result.
2832.10 2842.10 speaker4  Oh my gosh. Really cool artwork. Go check out Witch Hazel. I believe so. Witch.hazel on Instagram.
2841.10 2845.10 speaker3  It's witch.hazels. I think it's plural.
2844.10 2852.10 speaker4  It's dope though.
2850.10 2858.10 speaker1  And I checked out all her Instagram stuff. It was all really cool. Yeah.
2857.10 2866.10 speaker3  Check out their live shows. Is it the first?
2865.10 2870.10 speaker4  Drive to Springfield. Fly to Springfield. We got an airport.
2869.10 2885.10 speaker2  Come drink with us. We'll be at that show. Thanks for listening. And we'll have more content for you that is part of the contention narrative coming very, very soon. Bye guys. Bye.
2884.10 2885.10 speaker4  Like and subscribe.
