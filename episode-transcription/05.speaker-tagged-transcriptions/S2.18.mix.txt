Oh shit, it's this week's Howlin' with Wolf. And this week's HWW comes from Kate in Limestone, New York, who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod. A very easy and helpful thing to do. Go on, do it for ol' Wolfie. Kate from Limestone, New York writes, I wanna thank the PTBP gang for confirming to my coworkers that I am exactly as fuckin' weird as they thought. And shout out to Mickalyn for introducing me to this absolute shit show in my newest hyper fixation. You're one of the best humans I could know. I can't wait to hear these idiots fuck up next episode.
100.44 108.84 speaker1  that it's Kate from Limestone's birthday today.
106.32 138.36 speaker0  Wait, do y'all know what that means? I'm unfamiliar with a birth day. And I hope your birthday is one in which things happen that humans generally desire. If you wanna write up somethin' for your bone-filled wolf to how, tag at Pretending Pod on Twitter or Instagram.

159.70 270.24 speaker0  Apparently, a Zatch of some sort took over my airwaves recently, which is... It's fine. He at least had some cool news. The good people here at PTBP will be matching all new and upgrading Patreon subscriptions for the month of December. And they're takin' that doubled amount and donating it to a crisis cold weather shelter in a place called Springfield, Missouri to help keep the folks in their community warm during the upcoming winter months. and oh, that's right, they'll also shelter them pets. Links in the show notes. Help those pretending to be people boys help the folks in their community Links in the show notes. Last year, the Patreon went up $400. We matched that and donated $800 to the shelter. This year, it's already up over 250 bucks. Thanks to y'all. Links in the damn show notes. the 38th exclusive episode is a Contention PD Halloween special called It's the Butterfinger Bandit Keith Beans. The boys play child versions of their season one characters
266.78 284.08 speaker1  the spooky nature of my omniscience.
279.08 298.10 speaker0  Apparently, that Zach being does a decent recap, so no need for me to double dip. I'm just here to exalt Alter Girl with
294.36 339.04 speaker1  It's all my fault
338.04 345.04 speaker2  Give me that horse juice. I'm late to this.
343.04 360.04 speaker3  during White Boy Summer. Like, I understand.
359.04 372.04 speaker2  No. Oh, are we recording? 30 Seconds of Silence.
370.04 385.04 speaker3  Did I just say I like Chad Hanks on you? Did we record that? Okay, you gotta delete that.
383.04 399.04 speaker2  and you're apologizing for saying you get him. It was clearly a bit, Your Honor. So, what do you say? Do I delete all this or do we do 30 Seconds of Silence?
397.04 403.04 speaker3  Would have been fucking hilarious. I think it's up to Joe. 12 months ago.
401.04 409.04 speaker2  It doesn't matter that it's out of date because you opened it with this is,
407.04 410.04 speaker3  Yeah, I get it was in context for the fact that.
409.04 412.04 speaker2  What do you think, Luke?
411.04 442.04 speaker3  I like Tom Hanks. Orange County. that he would be a country music star? Oh, yeah. And then this happened. He didn't see the other way it could go. They didn't make these kind of Chets back then. That's right.
441.04 444.04 speaker2  The future didn't exist yet. Yeah.
443.04 450.04 speaker3  It was the brand new model. There was no way to foresee.
449.04 458.04 speaker2  It's unfortunate for Tom.
456.04 464.04 speaker3  He is living his truest life.
462.04 467.04 speaker2  I don't support Chet Hanks. I don't like Chet Hanks,
465.04 475.04 speaker3  but after watching an interview, I get why he is like he is.
472.04 486.04 speaker2  but more importantly, as of three nights ago, we've been recording for five years. December 1st. And we've been releasing for four years. That's insane.
484.04 489.04 speaker3  Did that one actually happen in November? Which one? Releasing.
488.04 507.04 speaker2  No. I think I uploaded three episodes early, but then we were like, it's December 1st is when it actually officially dropped, and that's when season one starts on December 1st, because of the calendar. You have to do that. Yeah.
505.04 517.04 speaker3  That is actual play legal. Who? Gary Gygax?
516.04 519.04 speaker2  That's his name, right, Joe?
518.04 538.04 speaker3  Yeah, yeah. You know who that is, right, Zach? When Gary Gygax received the original rules of D&D from God, it included that very specific fucking condition that the day it is today is the day you're roleplaying.
535.04 543.04 speaker2  The day it is today is the day that you're roleplaying. It's what it said on the tablets from Mountain Doom.
540.04 554.04 speaker3  Which he had to translate on his own and no one else could look at the handbooks from God. Are you implying he didn't do it faithfully, or he did it to some advantage for himself?
552.04 561.04 speaker2  I'm saying I think it might all be made up.
557.04 568.04 speaker3  as I don't know if we can continue on as friends. Certainly not roleplaying partners after. Are your guys' hands sweaty? My hands are the sweatiest they've ever been.
567.04 585.04 speaker2  I'm nauseous. I'm going to have to change gloves. Dude, I was watching Shark Tank
583.04 589.04 speaker3  That catches your body sweat when you work out, and the fucking commercials he was showing them.
587.04 609.04 speaker2  So you can drink it afterward? No, it's to help lose body weight Would that be his whole... It's just a heavy sweater. But in the video he showed of people using it,
606.04 616.04 speaker3  it was literally people afterwards dumping the sweat out and it was vile.
614.04 627.04 speaker2  that that's one of the only gags from Jackass that made me gag in real life. it was something about the sweat suit that got me so grossed out.
626.04 629.04 speaker3  And then Mark Cuban bought it.
627.04 640.04 speaker2  But wait, so is this guy's whole marketing thing? Is it some people want to see the sweat? Is that the whole thing? If Mark Cuban bought it, that means enough people out there do want to see.
637.04 645.04 speaker3  But it was like to lose water weight if you're like a wrestler or something trying to make weight, and then you've got to weigh it.
644.04 655.04 speaker2  I've seen people do that, where they tape off their pant legs and stuff like that, their sweat pants and stuff, to just keep it all in there. One of the guys was like,
654.04 663.04 speaker3  That can't be much. He's like, a lot of people will just buy it to see how much they sweat and look at their sweat.
662.04 665.04 speaker2  I don't want to say.
663.04 666.04 speaker3  Mark Cuban was like, oh no, I totally get that.
665.04 670.04 speaker2  I want to point out, Thomas has been making a face this whole time like he wants one.
669.04 679.04 speaker3  I don't want to, no, no, no. I don't want to say Mark Cuban is an infallible businessman and never makes mistakes. That's not why I think maybe there's something else going on here.
677.04 684.04 speaker2  What I think is going on is that
681.04 700.04 speaker3  Mark Cuban will buy a bad product and then bring that person into his life just to prank his other billionaire friends. but it's really all a Clooney-esque, pretty cruel. Like dinner for schmucks? Yeah, it's pretty much dinner for schmucks.
699.04 716.04 speaker2  But he shits in the guy's litter box. Oh my God.
714.04 732.04 speaker3  where they see how far they can get the product they think is the dumbest. And a special invitation. Donations? Oh, charity? It starts at home. That's why.
731.04 772.04 speaker2  In the month of December, we're going to take all new and upgrading subscriptions and we are going to match that increase and we're going to take that double the amount and we're going to donate it to a crisis cold weather shelter here in Springfield, Missouri to help keep people in our community warm during these cold winter nights. It takes all genders. From what we could see when we were doing our research last year, it seemed to be a really reputable and solid organization doing really good work in our hometown.
771.04 775.04 speaker1  Farmers almanac.
774.04 780.04 speaker3  The persimmons, yeah.
779.04 785.04 speaker4  Yep, that's how they do it. Spoon persimmons.
784.04 797.04 speaker3  What? We have a very large- Is that bio-farming? Yeah. House-less population in Springfield who are not served very well by our city government or the state government. Yeah. So there's a lot of people who really need it.
796.04 808.04 speaker2  Yeah, and it's really rad. We've got some extremely progressive churches who have come together to put this together and we're here to help support people doing good shit. A lot.
806.04 811.04 speaker3  10, 12 times in the past couple weeks here. I get it. We should have done it in November.
810.04 814.04 speaker2  That's my bad. No, no, no. I just mean-
812.04 816.04 speaker3  It's going to get worse.
815.04 817.04 speaker2  It's going to get worse.
816.04 822.04 speaker3  It's just going to get worse.
820.04 830.04 speaker2  I thought we'd try to bump those numbers that way we could send them a fair amount of cash. We're doing a raffle this time around.
829.04 837.04 speaker1  Raffle. You can win.
835.04 840.04 speaker2  I hope I win.
839.04 858.04 speaker3  That's right. Like when he comes back. Yeah. Soon. Enter me. Her heart? There's a left behind joke here. Res-e-rection? Is that what you're trying to say?
857.04 861.04 speaker2  He just- A resurrection. A res-e-rection.
860.04 869.04 speaker3  A res-e-rection. Wow, we're going to have to cut out so much of this fucking-
864.04 907.04 speaker2  Every $5 newly subscribed or upgraded Patreon subscription will get you one entry into the raffle. We're going to do three raffle winners at the end of December. Two of you will receive a PTBP t-shirt, any design you want from the merch store or the season one Patreon exclusive merch or the season two Patreon exclusive merch, which we're dropping this month in December and will be available to patrons in January. And it's fun. It's really fucking cool. Sick. Is it though? And we are going to have the third winner either receive a shirt, if you want that you can have a shirt, or if you'd prefer-
906.04 908.04 speaker3  I mean, sure.
907.04 913.04 speaker4  Should we start doing that? That's pretty fun.
912.04 918.04 speaker3  Hopefully you know how to do that. If not, we'll be interested. Oh yeah, don't-
915.04 930.04 speaker2  Then get a shirt. Okay, let's do it. Let's do a different option if they don't want to do the music. Did we say what they actually get? No, we haven't said what they actually get yet.
927.04 931.04 speaker3  If you don't want to do the music option, we'll make another one up.
930.04 943.04 speaker2  Okay, what would be cool? What if they got to- Oh, with the boys? And I'll run it and it'll be home brewed by me. Daddy and the boys?
942.04 957.04 speaker3  Daddy and the boys. And they only have to upgrade just like $5 to the entry?
952.04 960.04 speaker4  to see us record those Den of Sins, you can bump up to $15, get yourself two entries.
959.04 963.04 speaker2  Wait, that already happened. Nevermind. Cut.
962.04 986.04 speaker3  Oh yeah. It hasn't happened, but it will have. campaign, the hunt for John Lee Pettymore's gold. But gold. But gold. But gold. But gold. But gold. The hunt for John Lee Pettymore's gold. I'm but a gold. Oh, it's not even that. It's the hunt for John Lee.
985.04 1002.04 speaker1  Wow.
1000.04 1018.04 speaker3  But gold would be such a better title. Anyway, the lost treasure of John Lee Pettymore. It's a Patreon exclusive campaign. At any level you sign up for that, you'll get episodes of that, which will be coming out starting in December and going on for a few months after that.
1012.04 1029.04 speaker2  And those are podcast episodes, audio episodes, and that will be the 39th one that we will release. So there's 39 bonus episodes over on Patreon. Oh, and one other note. We've got an editor here at Pretending to Be People. Ooh.
1028.04 1033.04 speaker3  Who is it? Who is it?
1032.04 1075.04 speaker2  Collaborator. Collaborator. Collaborator. Nope. He already is a collaborator. Am I getting closer? His name is Cole Simmons of Brat Pit and now known as Mint Fatigue. Or other way around, wrote some music for a certain podcast theme song? I believe he produced and wrote, co-produced and co-wrote the music of our current season two theme song. What a good song.
1074.04 1078.04 speaker3  Hell yeah. Great songs. Great song for a good podcast.
1077.04 1102.24 speaker2  Good job, Cole. Anyway, so Cole is doing our first initial sweep of the podcast to do a nice edit through there for me. That way I can come on through and do the little creative edits I like to do afterwards without spending so much of my time editing. And I'm just so happy to have Cole here with us at Pretending to Be People.
1098.04 1108.04 speaker3  Cole removes everything problematic we say and then Zach goes back and creatively edits the things we actually said to make us something problematic. AI has gotten really, really good.
1105.04 1126.04 speaker2  It's a fun little game they like to play. Let's get into this fucking thing.
1125.04 1132.04 speaker3  Aspirin. You can get your aspirational dorm room at Target. Everything you need for back to school.
1131.04 1146.04 speaker2  Target's a big swing. It's Christmas at Target.
1145.04 1151.04 speaker3  What do we have?
1150.04 1154.04 speaker2  We're doing pretty good.
1151.04 1155.04 speaker3  I thought we had a solid 20 at least.
1154.04 1165.04 speaker2  16? That's not great.
1160.04 1172.04 speaker3  Don't be too selective with your edits here, Cole.
1167.04 1207.04 speaker2  You went with Stevie, the new intern and secret eldest child of Fred Godell, to an anonymously submitted dropped pin, which had been secretly submitted by Stevie. And that led you to a series of road signs telling you to turn around and a dead end with a dense tree line, which was secretly a wall covered in plants and bushes and trees. And inside was an unnaturally smooth gorge and a single simple steel train car took you across the wildly deep and foggy ravine with strangely slick sides. Of course, after you left behind all food and drink, which Stevie explained was secretly a ploy by Fred Godell because caffeine makes it harder for him to affect your mind.
1206.04 1230.04 speaker3  Caffeine-free lasagna. And then you finally- Now at Target. $14.99. Even had a full tank of gas.
1224.04 1271.04 speaker2  Gorge, there at each pump, a green Range Rover, and stepping out of one while staring directly at the Can-Van, was president of the Godell company himself, Fred Godell. Fox Godell with Stevie, just the two of them, where else but in Cal Colorado's basement. It's a very well-built basement. And then you decided to keep Vivica in the room to do a better edit of the footage from Grover's Gorge. And she crit-failed her grip check. Does anyone have anything they'd like to say about any of that? I'm sorry, Vivica.
1269.04 1282.04 speaker4  to show her any of the God stuff. Freaked in the bean.
1278.04 1293.04 speaker3  Sorry, we thought sanity was problematic, so this season we're going to have freaked
1291.04 1310.04 speaker2  Freaked in the bean indeed. those human-animal hybrids at the end, which were outlined by Beck Wilder in the edit,
1309.04 1313.04 speaker4  The people animals?
1310.04 1349.04 speaker2  Yeah, yeah, I think that more than anything. Yeah, they were like covered in blood too. One of them had like a pug face, but a human body. And I was asked on Instagram by a famous pretending to be people artist, Slidewhistle. Shout out to Slidewhistle. human skin flaps, but then in the shape of a pug. Excellent question. And I asked which was worse. And they said just the human skin with the flaps. So it was that? So I said that, yeah, for sure it's that.
1348.04 1352.04 speaker4  I agree.
1351.04 1369.04 speaker3  And cute Hannah. And it's just like in weird patches. Ugh, ducky ducky.
1368.04 1454.04 speaker2  Somebody do AI of that. in your ears pounding through your heads as you see the images of the unnaturally lush greenery and the sounds of the bones and cartilage and Julius's face being broken and rearranged. And you're brought right back to the most dreadful and confusing place you've ever seen on a screen, much less been to. Back to Grover's gorge and you feel nauseous. But this was your goal. You technically succeeded, but how these mixed emotions land on you right now, it's really up to the roll of the dice. So I'm going to need a grip check from each of you. And if you pass this grip check, the success and pride you feel in a mission accomplished pushes through the horrific memories and cements a stronger resolve. And you'll be able to add 1d8 to your grip and you'll be able to add 1d10 to any skill of your choosing with an explanation of how this resolve makes you better in that skill.
1453.04 1457.04 speaker3  I failed.
1456.04 1477.04 speaker4  I know. Ever.
1473.04 1521.04 speaker2  you lose yourselves in the footage playing in the editing bay and you won't be able to take your eyes off the screens and you'll miss Vivica tensing up like a horse editing a commercial for fireworks. You mean a dog?
1520.04 1523.04 speaker4  Yeah, we all failed. We missed it.
1522.04 1534.04 speaker2  Yeah, you all failed. So, wrapped up in your own sort of situation, she tensely continues the edit and wraps up.
1533.04 1538.04 speaker3  Wow, right?
1537.04 1540.04 speaker2  You handled it really well.
1538.04 1550.04 speaker3  It's going to, I mean, this is good news, right? Don't you think this is good? I mean, not this is bad news, but don't you think this makes great news? I, we're going to get promotions.
1549.04 1558.04 speaker2  Hey, hey, hey.
1554.04 1569.04 speaker3  but, well, let me say you're right to be nervous because I can't imagine anything beating you this year. We're talking Pulitzer.
1567.04 1573.04 speaker2  shaking your head no.
1569.04 1584.04 speaker3  I know you're a perfectionist, but I saw your cut and it's good. We've got to get it out immediately. People need to see this, Vivica. I know you probably want more time with it, right? She nods.
1581.04 1589.04 speaker2  She's running her hands over her face and-
1588.04 1594.04 speaker3  This is 9-11, Vivica. This is your 9-11. But, like, in a good way.
1592.04 1621.04 speaker2  I don't understand how that makes me comfortable. Yeah, go ahead and roll. How foolish of me. That's a pass. Yeah, I just worry about the larger implications.
1617.04 1629.04 speaker3  So we're just going to, Bec, can you just burn yourself a copy there that we're going to get sent out of the editing room over to production? You can keep working on this for your sizzle reel.
1628.04 1663.04 speaker4  Yeah, yeah. And I just go over and just plug it straight in and maybe kind of move her out of the way Does it go off without a hitch? That's a pass. 34 on a 60. It goes off without a hitch. I plug it out. Vivica, this is going to be a good thing. Like, did you see that medical device in there? Like, I know you freaked out by, like, the scary stuff, but there's also stuff there that's going to revolutionize the way we do medicine. Like, it could cure cancer.
1660.04 1666.04 speaker2  She's just stone face staring at the floor.
1664.04 1677.04 speaker3  Are you having personal problems?
1673.04 1681.04 speaker2  And you're asking me if I have personal problems right now. What the fuck is wrong with you?
1680.04 1705.04 speaker3  You're right. I feel like I already dealt with some of these truths, and I apologize if we thrust this upon you, as it were. We've had a little more time to process this than you have, apparently. You're the best in the business. It had to be you. We thought you would be, you know, strong enough to handle it versus hiding it from you.
1704.04 1706.04 speaker4  It's a good edit.
1705.04 1730.04 speaker3  It's a great edit. This is what this is, Vivica. This is justice, putting this out in the world. You saw what they did. You saw the footage from the It Pit. It has to be out there. Fine. So maybe, you know, adrenaline if you're not tired. Any kind of motions towards, like, her workstation.
1728.04 1749.04 speaker2  I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. What time is it right now?
1748.04 1757.04 speaker3  Well, and he wasn't at...
1754.04 1766.04 speaker2  Luke, he also wasn't at work today. That's right.
1763.04 1770.04 speaker4  Somebody at least gave a reason for his absence.
1768.04 1789.04 speaker2  It's a big tower that looks like a T. Good job. Good job, man.
1787.04 1799.04 speaker4  have any, like, second thoughts now? Like, that's gonna... What just happened is gonna happen all over the city,
1795.04 1801.04 speaker3  I think maybe that's the kind of outrage we need to fight against Grover's Gorge.
1799.04 1810.04 speaker4  Was it outrage or abject terror?
1806.04 1818.04 speaker3  We try to not hold their hands, or at least we did when I was an anchor here. I'm just saying... People will recognize.
1815.04 1840.04 speaker4  Vivica's, like, a hardened, like, professional who's edited, like, everything that's come through here, and she's never had a reaction like that. It's me, Beck.
1838.04 1846.04 speaker3  Are you fine? Are you afraid of success?
1842.04 1857.04 speaker4  If it's, like, success on one hand, and, like, you know, people not being able to live in the world that we present them as fact now, I don't know which is worth it.
1855.04 1862.04 speaker3  so I think it's going up.
1859.04 1873.04 speaker4  maybe just take out a few of the more mind-blowing things? Maybe the animal people come out, and we save that for later?
1868.04 1897.04 speaker3  A whole week of series progressively leading up to... He's into it. Absolutely. As we tease the real things. But it will also, yes, perhaps, anesthetize the population to some extent against the kind of surely atypical reaction we've seen here.
1894.04 1948.04 speaker2  the frosty glass door that leads into the editing bay, it's a pole, and it is being pushed as a body slams into it, and then disheveled opens the door, flinging it open, and you see Kurt, you guys would know Kurt. He's in his thirties, but he looks older, his eyes are sunken in, and he's wearing a disheveled can windbreaker. He's got big curly hair on top, and as he kind of pushes in, you see he's got an old TCN polo underneath his can windbreaker. to different news agencies that he's taken throughout the late evening of night, and he kind of flings the door open, Oh, let me get the voice.
1946.04 1952.04 speaker3  not because I disapproved of your voice choice. Boys, welcome.
1949.04 1958.04 speaker2  Boys, boys, welcome to daddy. Oh, boy.
1956.04 1979.04 speaker4  Boys, welcome to daddy.
1977.04 1986.04 speaker2  What's the voice?
1984.04 1989.04 speaker3  He flings the mic. Sorry, Cole. He flings the door open.
1988.04 1998.04 speaker4  Hey, it's me, Kurt. Hello. Hello, it is I, Kurtis.
1997.04 2055.04 speaker3  No, thank you. Wrong editing, babe. What do you want, Kurt?
2053.04 2061.04 speaker2  I want you to prepare.
2060.04 2064.04 speaker4  We tell you that every time.
2061.04 2073.04 speaker3  I don't know why, but also, we have some... Oh, Julius. Oh, Julius, no. I just only recently met him. I thought it was just... No, Julius, he gets every new employee.
2071.04 2078.04 speaker2  He introduced himself to me as daddy.
2076.04 2122.04 speaker3  Oh, this is very disappointing. Julius feels dirty. Kurt, you ought to be ashamed. Julius, I'm sorry. This is Kurt. We're probably pretty full up this week, but let's see. Yeah, this might be the last time you see us down in the non-executive editing bay. That's not a real thing, but we're on the up and up is what I mean. But let's see what footage you have. Beck likes Kurt.
2121.04 2127.04 speaker4  No. Kurt? Kurt, you got another tape?
2126.04 2132.04 speaker2  It's fucked up, man.
2130.04 2142.04 speaker4  and it was just a guy taking a swim in the river, right?
2141.04 2172.04 speaker3  I mean, I'm sorry, Kurt. No offense or some offense. to film the grisly aftermath. We go back to your place. Julius pops the video in to see what's on it.
2166.04 2182.04 speaker2  as the EMTs are rushing over to a car that is flipped over on a bridge in the city, looking out beyond this accident. You see the city skyscape in the background. That's what it's called.
2179.04 2192.04 speaker3  Kyle shakes his head and turns away, like looks away.
2186.04 2359.04 speaker2  and one of the EMTs is running up to try to pry open the door to get the two of them. Suddenly, out of nowhere, you hear coming out the left speakers, the audio. A car speeding through slams into the EMT, who is trying to help accident on top of accident. It's gruesome. The camera zooms in. He rushes towards them, trying to figure out what was going on. The camera whips over behind to see where the car came from. There's nothing, but then the camera sees people stopping on this bridge, getting out of their cars, looking up beyond and above the camera. The camera whips around. It's like a bolt of lightning that's continuously striking, or an unnaturally focused tornado. An unholy, stomach-dropping phenomenon connects the sky above and the bridge below, and Kurt begins running toward it, the camera bouncing up and down as he zooms, and pulls focus onto this vibrating, humming, electric, and wet mass that makes up this towering force of nature, this terrifying, unfamiliar weather pattern. Quietly to himself, but right into the microphone, Kurt states, for the first of our kind upon witnessing them. this colossal cylinder of destruction is gone, and Kurt makes it to the front of a confused and scared crowd to shoot the wake of this devastation, and you all see a hole in this bridge about the size of a big revolving door at a mall, and Kurt approaches the edge with caution. You can hear onlookers screaming at him to get away and be careful, but he holds his camera out over the edge and you see the choppy waters of the enormous city river below, and there's a tugboat with a full barge, and it's too close to the changing tide. It's fighting, resisting the new path, but whatever that was, it punched a hole in the bottom of the city river, and this tugboat is circling the drain smoothly at first, and then violently, this vessel is ripped bow first, and it plunges into the unknown followed by its barge. Kurt doesn't move a fucking muscle, and after about 30 seconds worth of an eternity, the spiraling waters below slow their pattern, and the regular flow of the city river resumes, and as the camera zooms back out of the hole on this bridge,
2355.04 2372.04 speaker4  The tearing nature is rough and ugly and leaves shrapnel,
2367.04 2384.04 speaker2  and he runs up to the first person he sees who looks like Carrot Top.
2383.04 2392.04 speaker3  Smart.
2389.04 2402.04 speaker4  It's a kid, and he's also mouth agape, and he's staring at the hole, and he's looking into the camera,
2399.04 2409.04 speaker1  Is it like a special effect?
2406.04 2430.04 speaker4  and then it's like a mirror, right?
2426.04 2454.04 speaker3  in the Men in Black testing facility, because they're out at midnight with physics textbooks.
2452.04 2478.04 speaker2  And he goes up to the third person. Thomas, what do they look like? The camera whips back around to the original Carrot Top. Camera pans back and forth between the two of them.
2476.04 2492.04 speaker3  You see several more Carrot Tops in the crowd. One of them comes up and goes, has been angering God for a long time.
2490.04 2500.04 speaker4  Well, you might be surprised.
2499.04 2509.04 speaker2  Kurt runs away. Kurt runs away. The camera turns off and he's like,
2507.04 2537.04 speaker3  since his kind of false modesty at the start pretty much the whole time, and he chuckles. Well, that's a very nice, is that your audition reel for Marvel or the Fast franchise? It's a little weird that you have a kid point out its special effects halfway through, but that was very well done, I suppose. That's better than what you normally apply yourself to, I guess. Let's get a grip check from everybody.
2535.04 2543.04 speaker2  or if he actually feels that way. Cal passes.
2542.04 2553.04 speaker3  I got a 99. and runs out of it. I'm back.
2552.04 2558.04 speaker4  Clark, I'm fine.
2556.04 2585.04 speaker3  Julius lets out a wily, god damn it. What happens, Julius? And that was just from seeing this footage. Yeah. Go ahead and roll a D4. He flipped me off again.
2583.04 2589.04 speaker2  All right, you just lose one grip. Good.
2587.04 2602.04 speaker4  Can Beck look at that footage and see a time on it and try and compare maybe what we were doing in Grover's Gorge when this happened?
2597.04 2610.04 speaker2  it seems to have happened roughly 20 to 30 minutes after you left Cal Colorado's house. Oh, no.
2609.04 2613.04 speaker3  We have angered God.
2611.04 2618.04 speaker4  Can we, from landmarks in the footage or maybe just asking Kurt, where did this happen?
2616.04 2623.04 speaker3  Is it the neighbor near my house? Yeah.
2622.04 2638.04 speaker2  Bing, bing. Bing, bing. Bing, bing. Bing, bing. Taylor again. Bing, bing. Bing, bing. And then it goes to Stevie's voicemail.
2635.04 2644.04 speaker4  and Beck starts to get the drained blood from the head feeling. Hi, Stevie.
2642.04 2742.04 speaker3  Just wanted to check in, see how y'all are doing in my basement. Hope you're having a good time. I did, you know about the pizza money I left. I think I told you about that. If you don't, there's $25 on the counter. If that's not enough for pizza these days, I hope you're having a good time. Please just let me know that everything's okay. Thank you. Again, this is Cal Colorado. Good night. Choice. and is on one of the lightning strike looking things. And is just like intently just staring at it and picking at his face. Gross. Again, I do find this all very impressive and certainly better than your normal filth and depravity. You should pursue this passion for CG, computer-generated imagery. But we do have to go check on our friend. This has been Cal Colorado. and looks at Kurt and he's like, what's the rate, daddy? What's the rate, Kurt?
2739.04 2771.04 speaker2  I'm hoping for 800. Yep. This'll do. And he's out. is that the move?
2770.04 2777.04 speaker4  before we leave. Yeah. Maybe just tap on the bathroom door. Oh, yeah.
2774.04 2780.04 speaker3  We have a whole new release strategy to discuss with her.
2778.04 2785.04 speaker2  So when you tap on the door, she immediately opens it.
2783.04 2787.04 speaker4  and we've talked about it and... She goes for a hug.
2786.04 2793.04 speaker2  Oh, hey. It's like kind of weird. It's like not normal.
2791.04 2812.04 speaker4  We talked about it and you're right, that this is maybe too much too fast. We're gonna take another pass at the edit and we're just gonna take out some of the really scary stuff and maybe kind of build up to it over the course of a week or two. Prepare people for it. You were right. It is scary. You were right, Vivica.
2809.04 2837.04 speaker2  Beck, if you could roll alertness. and she kind of walks out and is like... and we'll see you in the morning. See you tomorrow.
2836.04 2845.04 speaker4  It's all gonna be okay.
2839.04 2850.04 speaker2  I need either humant or alertness from Julius and Cal.
2849.04 2869.04 speaker3  Okay. I critically fail. Okay. Either within 88.
2865.04 2887.04 speaker2  off of the marbleless floor in front of you. Empty, dark outside but it's well lit in here. Well lit? Yeah, you can hear a vacuum going in the background as it's like 3.30 in the morning.
2885.04 2893.04 speaker3  Should we go check on God?
2891.04 2904.04 speaker4  that Kirk brought is, I don't know, did something fuck up at the God basement? Wasn't that your neighborhood, Cal?
2902.04 2908.04 speaker3  It wasn't quite as nice.
2907.04 2914.04 speaker2  Yeah, yeah.
2912.04 2958.04 speaker3  but no, that's not quite my neighborhood. What do you mean? It's actually probably the most popular suicide bridge in the city. Yeah, it's like 83.6 yards tall. It's on TripAdvisor. it was built in the 1880s It's the subject of some local fascination. And how far of a walk from your apartment is it? 15 minutes. Julius just kind of looks at Beck and Cal.
2956.04 2963.04 speaker4  Yeah, it could have happened, I guess.
2961.04 2966.04 speaker3  and I've got a bad feeling.
2964.04 2974.04 speaker4  We have a date with you in the hospital. Do you want to get dropped off, me and Cal, go check it out?
2972.04 2977.04 speaker3  I looked it up in the rules, by the way,
2974.04 3007.04 speaker2  and the official rules of Delta Green. You're not conscious at two hit points. Like, you can't even... How could you be? You're not conscious at one or two hit points. Good thing I've got four. and if you succeed, then you're fine. You're just unconscious. But if you fail, you take a permanent injury that reduces one of your stats. It's super bad for you.
3006.04 3012.04 speaker3  Well, no, because it worked out
3009.04 3021.04 speaker2  to stay conscious both times, I believe. So no permanent injury, which works out well.
3018.04 3032.04 speaker3  Yes, we're not breaking any rules. which technically I've got so many hours to get back there. Let's go. I'll go with you.
3029.04 3045.04 speaker4  I'm just worried if a strong breeze comes through.
3042.04 3059.04 speaker2  I think it's just going to be 3.30 in the morning. Basically, you're exhausted. Cal is exhausted. Yeah.
3055.04 3088.04 speaker3  Now that the energy of getting the edit done, the excitement, all the adrenaline from today is finally worn off, he's not sure why Vivica is so adverse to this amazing opportunity that's been dropped in front of him. And he just wants to go back to his apartment, his nice apartment where nothing has happened. I guess if I've got to go to sleep, I might as well go to sleep at the hospital. So I guess call me and let me know if Stevie's there. Righty-o.
3085.04 3102.04 speaker2  Okay, so you guys are going to leave and drop off Julius at the hospital on the way to Cal Colorado's townhouse. I need an alertness check
3101.04 3115.04 speaker3  Wow, dude. 89. Wow.
3113.04 3125.04 speaker2  and you don't see. Okay, it could be worse.
3124.04 3128.04 speaker4  Yeah.
3126.04 3144.04 speaker2  I guess it'll be fun later. And we can all look back and be like,
3143.04 3159.04 speaker4  No, it's great. If the sky is on fire or there's people screaming and running.
3157.04 3174.04 speaker3  there are multiple Waldos in each scene that we could have been rolling to find. And he's like, wow, interesting. You don't wear... Do you know what they call it in England?
3173.04 3177.04 speaker4  I was going to guess Wally. So maybe I did know it at some point.
3176.04 3187.04 speaker3  And then I could say, No, it's Where's your cunt or something stupid. But it's Where's Wally?
3186.04 3204.04 speaker2  So you head off. And at the hospital, we're going to go ahead and have you stay overnight and get some health back. Yeah. So go ahead and roll a D4. I also looked up the rules for Delta Green on this. Apparently you're supposed to roll for the surgeon to see if they're good enough to help you.
3203.04 3213.04 speaker3  One. Wow. Surely you could also have a credit rating roll against that to see if you can afford a good surgeon.
3211.04 3230.04 speaker2  because his health insurance with City Action News Yep. So you're going to wake up up to five. However, you do also every single night gets you-
3229.04 3235.04 speaker3  Two back for talking to the nurse.
3233.04 3237.04 speaker4  That doesn't seem mechanically fair. No, no.
3236.04 3277.04 speaker3  Turns out the surgeon sucks. Don't they? You absolutely should get more than one. This is the start of the arc where we sue the hospital for their incredible malpractice and treating Julius.
3274.04 3281.04 speaker2  they call you and are like, actually. Okay.
3280.04 3282.04 speaker3  Yeah, for now.
3281.04 3288.04 speaker2  What did they do to me? Fluids. And-
3287.04 3291.04 speaker4  Fluids. Fluids. Just fluids.
3290.04 3295.04 speaker2  One pain.
3294.04 3322.04 speaker3  Morphine. Morphine. You're fucking high as shit. No pain, one gain. On the good stuff. Hopefully you guys don't need me.
3321.04 3328.04 speaker4  It doesn't seem correct.
3325.04 3333.04 speaker3  up, you're going to get six hit points or some shit.
3330.04 3356.04 speaker2  Since when have we played by the rules?
3354.04 3365.04 speaker3  Should I step outside? Yeah, I guess so. You should go wait in the cold. Oh, do you have a Bluetooth headphones? I don't. I forgot the headphones. You can just rub your ears.
3364.04 3367.04 speaker2  I have headphones.
3365.04 3391.04 speaker3  I'll go outside until it's too cold. You can go to your room. I'll go to my room. You can put in my headphones. I'm going to go outside. That way I can, well, I can vape in my own room too, but just let me know.
3389.04 3394.04 speaker4  Did you guys drive separately?
3393.04 3398.04 speaker3  Yeah, we're all in the can van.
3397.04 3405.04 speaker2  Okay, right.
3402.04 3414.04 speaker3  where he left it before we headed out to Grover's Gorge. Yeah. How, like two days ago or whatever?
3413.04 3416.04 speaker2  Classic time law.
3415.04 3421.04 speaker3  Time law, not van law.
3416.04 3425.04 speaker2  But yeah, so it says July 6th on your phone, but it, you know, you haven't slept in July 6th yet, so it's still July 5th in your bones.
3424.04 3428.04 speaker3  Yeah, exactly.
3427.04 3432.04 speaker4  Okay, sounds good.
3431.04 3437.04 speaker2  You see nothing.
3436.04 3466.04 speaker3  Nice. Beep, beep. As he passes Beck parking on the street in a salute. Beep, beep. Yeah, Cal could walk straight into the basement from the garage, but to be polite to Beck, he walks out the door, back up onto the street, and then lets him in the front door. And before they go downstairs, he's like, do you want anything? Uh, tea, coffee?
3463.04 3472.04 speaker4  We just got to make sure Stevie's like here and okay.
3467.04 3481.04 speaker3  I assume they fell asleep playing chess or Catan.
3479.04 3509.04 speaker4  Yeah, it's a fun one. Do you know it? Oh yeah, we play it all the time in the group. Oh, we should play it. The sheep are good. Sometimes you can get a good floor and you corner the market on them.
3501.04 3526.04 speaker2  Cal hits the light and you see the restraints previously on the body of Greg Godell, which have been cut off, lying helplessly, lying lifelessly on the ground of the basement of Cal Colorado's basement.
3525.04 3539.04 speaker3  What's lifeless? All the stuff that- Oh, okay. I don't give a shit. Where's Stevie?
3537.04 3546.04 speaker4  I kind of expected one or the other to still be here.
3545.04 3549.04 speaker3  the help of- A god. A turtle.
3548.04 3569.04 speaker4  God turtle. God turtle. A pizza god turtle. No, I think that something bad has happened. They're not here. The whole thing was that they were supposed to stay here. floor. Is it, it's cut? Is that what you said? Yeah, it's cut. Are there like scissors or a knife laying around?
3567.04 3574.04 speaker2  There's a pair of scissors sitting on a table. Okay. Just nearby.
3571.04 3587.04 speaker4  I wondered if he had somehow cut himself free or if she had helped him. Could be either one. I think that maybe Stevie set them loose.
3584.04 3598.04 speaker3  No signs of forced ingress. It seems logical, yes, that she unlocked the door herself down here and took them both
3594.04 3606.04 speaker4  She knew the whole thing was to like not let him get to a place where he could kill himself. So maybe, I don't know, he said something to her that made her think that wouldn't happen?
3605.04 3623.04 speaker3  than we are. I do. Ah, fuck.
3622.04 3643.04 speaker4  That's like what he says. Have you seen like, you had to have seen the 1973 Bigfoot that he had. He's 30. He's like 30.
3642.04 3644.04 speaker3  Right.
3643.04 3661.04 speaker2  Exactly. Right.
3659.04 3674.04 speaker3  The biggest year on record. For instance, in 2021, there were only five estimated big feet born. That's a lot less.
3672.04 3695.04 speaker2  There's smaller feet now. Little feet. Beck, it's clear.
3692.04 3707.04 speaker4  I was really hoping we could like crash here and then.
3703.04 3709.04 speaker3  Would she answer your call or a text?
3708.04 3720.04 speaker4  I'll give that a shot, yeah.
3718.04 3734.04 speaker3  You know Carol, you know my daughter. Do you ever find me exhausting, Beck?
3732.04 3740.04 speaker4  I would be exhausted at some point. But that just happens in relationships.
3739.04 3749.04 speaker3  Thank you, Beck. Sometimes we say things to hurt the ones we love. I'm on the call. I'm on the call. Oh, oh, oh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
3748.04 3762.04 speaker1  Breathe, breathe.
3759.04 3788.04 speaker4  We're really worried about you because you're not where we left you, and that was kind of the whole thing we had set up, is that you'd be where we left you. Cal hopes that you don't think he's exhausting, and I hope that you're alive and that your brother's alive and that there's not a new god in the world that is maybe bad for us. I don't... I'll talk to you later. Bye.
3787.04 3791.04 speaker2  Just please call?
3789.04 3798.04 speaker3  Beck, I know you prefer to take the can van, but perhaps tonight on this hunt for Stevie, we should take my ride.
3797.04 3806.04 speaker4  Is that what you're talking about? Dude, yeah.
3805.04 3807.04 speaker2  Thomas doesn't know.
3806.04 3810.04 speaker3  Coupe C. C class.
3809.04 3818.04 speaker2  Hey, Luke.
3817.04 3821.04 speaker4  but I could... Yeah, we'll get it in there. No, no, no, Beck.
3820.04 3835.04 speaker3  It was a search mission. And frankly, while I've seen tonight what today, what a common cell phone can do.
3833.04 3837.04 speaker4  And mine as well.
3836.04 3842.04 speaker3  So...
3841.04 3853.04 speaker2  He's so exhausted. He's being a bitch.
3852.04 3859.04 speaker4  This is more story. We need to film it. It's more story.
3858.04 3864.04 speaker3  No sound, no lights.
3863.04 3870.04 speaker2  I'm not carrying a boom.
3869.04 3874.04 speaker3  Through the streets. In my sweet Mercedes.
3873.04 3879.04 speaker2  I looked it up.
3878.04 3905.04 speaker4  I'll grab... I'll just grab some of the mics and I can fit a tripod. Yeah, that's what I'm going to grab. We need equipment.
3903.04 3910.04 speaker3  He Tetris is a pretty sweet kid. Yeah. All right.
3908.04 3924.04 speaker2  Now, I think if you go out and continue this, you're not going to be able to get a sleep and then show up at a normal time to work. So you're going to be at a negative 40 all day for the next day.
3922.04 3930.04 speaker3  I think we deserve to sleep in. Wake up pretty late. I just didn't know how late. 7 a.m.
3929.04 3931.04 speaker2  This hunt.
3930.04 3946.04 speaker3  Oh, I mean, I figured we're... and you'd show us God or whatever
3944.04 3949.04 speaker2  I wasn't worried about mechanics in this hunt.
3948.04 3970.04 speaker3  You're going to the hole? Yeah. Right? Sure. Awesome.
3966.04 3975.04 speaker2  into downtown from Cal, Colorado's lovely neighborhood. Beck.
3974.04 3977.04 speaker3  No.
3976.04 4016.04 speaker2  It is blocked off. 80 men died building this. There are all sorts of different crews. You see people in suits. You see people in all sorts of different... There's cops. There's people in hazmat gear. There's all sorts of different... There's tents popping up. There's a whole crew. There's a whole kit and caboodle, a whole situation happening. News crew? There are other news crews that have begun piling up here. Yeah.
4013.04 4027.04 speaker3  Cal elbows you a little too hard in the ribs and he's like, You were right, Beck. We should have brought all this shit.
4024.04 4034.04 speaker4  and the light here I can attach to the top. Yeah, we're set.
4031.04 4046.04 speaker3  and you're holding it in one hand and a boom in the other.
4045.04 4057.04 speaker4  The perfect lighting. Or not live. We're to tape in four, three, two, silent one.
4056.04 4094.04 speaker3  Are you getting this? Are you getting this? We're live on Bean's Bridge. Reporting from the scene of a bizarre accident, some kind of hole has been punctured through the structure. We've got some footage obtained by a consultant earlier tonight. Once again, I want to stress this was not shot by anybody strictly affiliated with Cannes News. But you can see here, folks, you can see here the extraordinary footage captured earlier tonight showing what we're approaching the hole now. You can probably see in the insert, again, the footage.
4090.04 4104.04 speaker2  has bottlenecked up and there's big kind of wooden structures with four legs and a bar across the top.
4103.04 4111.04 speaker4  Yeah.
4110.04 4113.04 speaker3  You're right. Yep, it's a barricade.
