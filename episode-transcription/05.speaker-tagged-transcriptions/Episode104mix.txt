0.00 219.84 speaker0  What is boiling, my dumplings? It's your chef de cuisine, Wolf the dog. And I am pinching dough like a mad dog so I can provide sustenance to all my glorious fans. Hope y'all like that boiled dough with some mayonnaise inside. And I am cooking it up live from 694.2 PTBP, the only radio station to win a Michelin star by force. This episode's Howlin' with Wolf is from at Sis Fordman from Maryland, who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod, the sixth best thing you can do with your fingers. They write, the network has been compromised, root access granted. The reality we know or knew is DDoSed and held by dark matter. All bow, the new pseudo is here. This exploit is sticking around. Patch Tuesday, kernel panic. Your disk is spinning fast and you can't dump the RAM. Unplug yourself and pray. Silas Cole is here to fuck up your day. Sis admin, what the fuck did you just make me read? If this is about computers again, I'm going to be so fucking pissed off. Remember, if you want to write up something for your cream filled doughy wolf to how, tag at pretending pod on the internet or write a five star review on Apple podcasts, please. If you're one of the blessed angels or demons who make a post, forget the om, I just want to say T Hanks, thanks. I don't want to be cast away in a green mile of thick woods solely-ing the forest with my gump. I want to be big. Now onto the next thing I do. It's time for the news of the world. Last time, Don D. Pettymore was confronted with the fact that his nephew is a non-human being that currently resides inside its own daddy, Don's brother. This was after John, as always, forgot that not everyone already understands his current condition. Jack explained, he was searching for the door out of this place. Keith promised Leo they'd come back for him to take him away from this existence. Don admitted he came to this plane through his Nike bag, the same one he used as Agent Victor to dispose of an unnatural rotary phone that supposedly healed anyone of anything. John gained a new understanding of his abilities in this setting, and he dissipated an opening into the wall of this junk room where Keith claimed a rope bridge connected and led to a second stilted bunker. The group decided to call the number of the rotary phone, and they heard a ring from across the oily, colorful bridge inside this duplicate fort. The entire party witnessed a dreadful sight as Keith, Don, and Jack all walked out onto the Bridge of Spies. Boom, another Tom Hanks reference at the buzzer. Now listen here. No, closer, closer.
216.60 229.04 speaker1  This track is in a league of its own.
224.04 245.90 speaker0  ["What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?" by Dragon in Three plays in the background.]
242.24 279.06 speaker1  Crossing the double line, doing it every time Tell me what kind of world are you livin' in? What kind of world are you livin' in? We're pretending to be people,
274.58 361.26 speaker2  My name is Zach, and I am your handler, not your best friend, not your dad, I'm the hand, I'm here with my second, third, fourth, and 17th best friends, and how are you guys doing? I was trying to cover it up by really being over-hyped in the intro, but... Your butt turned green? You hate to hear it. Yeah, the whole thing. Is it mad? It's jealous. Because I think just within the cheeks I could get two, but I don't think any are going in my actual asshole. Oh, standing up for sure, I mean. Yeah, wow.
359.86 402.66 speaker1  I don't think I could get any As long as you put the whole thing in you, you can slice it up. Okay. Okay. Do I get to eat it after- Any part you slice off does have to go up there.
399.66 409.90 speaker2  and you bite down where the skin meets the flesh, like the inside, and the skin just goes right up in between your teeth? That's awful.
409.06 414.74 speaker1  No.
412.30 433.18 speaker2  with your butt instead of your mouth, huh? I'm doing this new thing where I say, huh? Your butt doesn't have teeth. This is a good introduction to the podcast. Again, right up on that microphone.
430.06 484.46 speaker1  if you don't get up on that. Yeah, it could just be our normal bullshit, I don't know. no one knows who started it. Okay, what do you want to talk about putting up our buttholes?
481.06 493.30 speaker2  Save it for the den of sin, baby, save it. Patreon people know what the fuck barrel is all about. Yeah, they do.
491.34 521.58 speaker1  before the general public? Oh, hell yeah. Ah, the bridge, I jump off the bridge. Back to safety. Take it to the bridge.
516.58 557.74 speaker2  Like the last episode ended on a bit of a cliffhanger. I need stealth roles from Clark Bishop and John Lee Kevinmore because they were trying the Littles, Aiden and Alice, who they had one interaction with previously.
555.94 559.98 speaker1  Am I close enough to hear him say this?
557.74 569.70 speaker2  No, this is his own internal narration
565.30 601.62 speaker1  Yes, he's reminded himself as he expertly avoids identification by these children with a 39 on a 50. Oh, well done. Unfortunately, Clark is like peeking his head out Hey, look, it's those kids. Hey, look over there and he's pointing.
598.02 632.10 speaker2  who's hanging out, hanging out Beatles style of this doorway. And they both give you the, pointing two fingers at their eyes, these little twin children eyes, and then pointing those same two fingers right up at Clark Bishop.
629.80 650.94 speaker1  and he's like watching that over his shoulder.
647.70 659.66 speaker2  anywhere between 10 and 12, so 11. Sigh.
657.14 676.00 speaker1  I was picturing way more, like these are, that we could just kind of, you know, push off the bridge or something, but.
673.66 755.32 speaker2  They are standing on a boat. Did you say they're both little? that's super colorful has been written on with the shimmering silver sea seemingly. There are shiny numbers all over the whole of the boat and it is the numbers that spell overseer. And the figurehead of the vessel is a young man with curly black hair who Don seemingly recognized. You could see it in his eyes. And I mean, this dude is being melted continuously about from the waist down as he's halfway in the water and his mouth has been steeled shut as well. And he's just like. And Julie Maxwell was wearing a hospital gown. Couldn't help but notice when I said that she had a massive gash running down her forehead,
752.52 772.72 speaker1  Before you said running down her forehead, there was a pretty big pause when you just said
767.72 786.76 speaker2  Her nose is missing and she smiles with no teeth or lips on one full side of her face. You think doo-doo her face being smashed.
784.92 801.48 speaker1  I don't have to pile on that particular theme, but what's this about her doo-doo gash? Jesus Christ.
796.80 860.04 speaker2  and that side that is missing the teeth and lips has an eye. There's an eyeball there. That part isn't missing, but across her face on the other orbital socket, if you're at home, don't Google orbital socket or orbital socket oozing. But this one is oozing with this dark substance is pouring out. Okay, so her head snaps forward and a metal sphere climbs out like a massive spidery tendrilly metal thing just like pulls itself up out of the body of Julie Maxwell and continues to hold that body at the end of one of its tendrils as one of the other ones lashes out and rips at the bridge that Keith Bishop. Nope.
857.76 870.16 speaker1  we've been keeping this whole time. We were all brothers, carnival brothers. I'm my own grandpa.
867.20 877.40 speaker2  In this world, all it takes to get married is to share a microwaved meal on the same recliner.
875.32 880.32 speaker1  So you guys are technically married.
877.40 901.72 speaker2  Okay, so this thing just like it plants some of its legs down into the boat and then one of them rips out at this rope bridge that's made out of this same dark and colorful material and Keith beans and Jack Russell
899.80 912.44 speaker1  Oh, that's right.
907.44 937.20 speaker2  What are you doing as the metal tendril rips down in between the three of you and this stilted room that Clark Bishop and John Lee Kevin Moore are inside? and you're about five yards into it. You're like exactly halfway. Also, give me your dexterity.
935.52 938.04 speaker1  Mine is 55.
937.20 938.88 speaker2  Same.
938.04 1008.96 speaker1  I got a 60. Don John. Great movie. Oh yeah, you love film? Just has a lot to say. Not a lot of people get it. Not a lot of people get it, but it actually has a lot of really insightful things to say kind of turns the whole gender thing on its head. And Joseph Gordon-Levitt was the white man to do that. the whole time, which is crazy. See, like I said, you always find out new things about that movie. So if you consider yourself a film buff, check out Don John. All the stunts in the movie, he did for the most part. He actually cleaned an apartment as a man?
1003.96 1038.64 speaker2  Five yards to your left is the second large stilted room that you have not been to. There's a hatch that is just right there, five yards away. And five yards on your right, on the other side, you see this John made hole and you see John kind of hiding. His back is turned. He's looking through a compact as Clark is hanging his head out What do you do?
1035.20 1049.92 speaker1  Below 50, I jumped back to the John made hole. 87, I jumped to the hatch.
1048.56 1071.28 speaker2  Well done, well done. Okay, fantastic. So you are running, running, running as this bridge is falling out beneath you and you are going to be able to make a leap without falling to your likely demise. Good thing you passed that rule.
1068.96 1076.84 speaker1  from the point that I'm standing, right? Correct.
1072.12 1118.16 speaker2  Like the bridge part that is nearest you is going to fall. You're not sure whether or not it will go into the water but if I said earlier that the bridge is 10 yards long and from one of the stilted hatch doors of the room down to the shining, shimmering, shiver sea, I think I said that was maybe 10 yards, 15 yards, but it definitely wasn't less than 10 yards. And so if you're like holding onto the rope bridge then you'll probably be safe from falling into the not ocean. Certainly not. No, I was just trying to give you an idea of like what it looks like as it's happening.
1115.84 1182.02 speaker1  I mean, I don't think I have an action here. I want to stay on this side of the place because I'm thinking about the boat He's not going to like run out there. I'll see if anything catches my eye that could be helpful in this situation. Maybe like bed sheets or something. I rolled a 50 on a search and that's not good. I've got a 20 in search. These'll work. because the one we were going to is where the telephone was ringing, correct?
1178.82 1197.10 speaker2  And that is where Keith is like sprinting towards very like agilely running across this bridge that is currently falling.
1195.70 1207.62 speaker1  Dexterity it is.
1205.54 1229.18 speaker2  Okay, fantastic. So you are going to be able to make the jump as well. At the beginning of your next turn, you're going to be able to make that jump. John, you see Clark digging through and finding pillowcases. What are you doing?
1227.18 1235.98 speaker1  And specifically the John Mayhole?
1231.50 1245.46 speaker2  You are 10 yards away from the hatch that is across and then you are 10 yards away from the boat
1242.66 1252.10 speaker1  I see that everybody else who's out there on the bridge is currently running to the other bunker, correct?
1250.90 1261.42 speaker2  So he hasn't moved because that's how games work in real life too.
1258.38 1269.02 speaker1  John, just I want to just start like closing the John Mayhole.
1266.54 1281.46 speaker2  Okay, roll unnatural.
1280.46 1319.52 speaker1  Describe it. He looks like he's frantically like trying to mop up a mess with his hands. He doesn't make like a good or like, it doesn't look like a manmade solid wall like it might have before. You can actually see like his fingerprints and stuff as he just like quickly goo-clayed it back into solid. so they can see what's going on.
1315.62 1418.54 speaker2  you're probably the only one who sees Jack Russell. I'm going to do the same roll that Luke did, above 50 goes towards them, under 50 tries to go back where he came from, I rolled a 94. And so he's going to take off running to follow Keith and Dawn, and he rolls a 10. So Jack Russell is going to run along. So the three of you, picture it like, I'm picturing a Wes Anderson framing of this scene because it's very flat, you know. You've got this endless background behind you, but then you have two identical stilted rooms on either side of the frame, 10 yards above this silver sea that just goes on endlessly into the background. And then there's a bridge hanging in the middle. Jack, Dawn, and Keith are sprinting to the right as the bridge collapses from the left. And as they run, the three of them kind of jump out. And I'm picturing kind of a railing going around the outside on this one maybe. And so Keith is able to make the leap and hopefully grab on. So Keith, go ahead and roll as you see behind you, this giant ball after it crashes down. John, you can see this too through your thimble sized hole. And so.
1417.14 1429.66 speaker1  poking one of its legs through it. I'm trying to head off that eventuality.
1428.30 1435.18 speaker2  And so you.
1433.42 1447.98 speaker1  I'm pretending to be people after dark.
1442.98 1491.42 speaker2  They're planting themselves into this silvery ocean and you hear a noise. And you see these tendrils are all the same texture. It's this shiny, shiny metal. It's like the same texture, but a solid of the ocean that is out there. And you hear this like. And you think that it is coming from the ball. It is like reverberating this noise through the world that you're in.
1489.10 1499.46 speaker1  or is it actually like metallic sounds?
1494.46 1509.82 speaker2  However, it does sound like the vocalizations of an entity.
1508.98 1522.02 speaker1  Yeah. I passed a 54 on a 60 or 75.
1519.34 1565.86 speaker2  you're seeing it's like kind of stilted movements of the ball as this noise is coming out of it seemingly. Not only do you realize that even in ball form, you would still be able to speak and vocalize just like this thing is. And it might sound like a little metallic, but it would be your voice. And this thing's voice sounds animalistic and taking that idea one step further, you think that this ball might've been inside an animal for the past, who knows how long. It's the raccoon. And that's why it speaks like this.
1564.30 1568.74 speaker1  It's a feral ball.
1567.02 1578.18 speaker2  Yeah, it's a rabid ball. That's so dope.
1574.78 1627.22 speaker1  who's frantically gathering pillowcases, I guess. And he's like, quick update, door's closed. That ball is some kind of feral ball. I don't really know where I was going with that anyway. And he drops it. I mean, it can't hurt. Find a Sharpie in here. You could draw a little face on it. And then that could be your mask from those kids. and a big beard, and then it won't look like Clark. Exactly. So.
1623.98 1633.18 speaker2  in order to reach out and grab.
1632.34 1644.74 speaker0  Oh. On a hundred.
1642.62 1659.46 speaker1  was always darting off to the Olympics.
1657.46 1666.42 speaker2  So you fall. He could spend luck. Oh. Ooh, well, how much luck do I have?
1665.58 1673.46 speaker1  Is it? It's not luck. Luck doesn't start over with the new sheet, does it? Ha!
1672.18 1676.74 speaker2  Okay, you begin falling. Do you want to describe it?
1674.30 1690.70 speaker1  Yeah, I am running along the bridge and then obviously start to lose footing. And I like jump and I smack my arms on where like the railing is. This room is hot. This area is pretty hot, right? Cause of the melted ocean.
1688.94 1702.18 speaker2  We've not talked about the temperature.
1699.46 1721.26 speaker1  and my hands hit the bars. I grab on just for a second, like try to pull myself up and then slip off relays that back to Clark.
1720.18 1724.46 speaker2  Right, yeah, of course.
1722.86 1746.42 speaker1  We might have to open this hole back up. He slipped off the bridge there. Is he in the molten? Is he in the sea? Is he gone?
1745.02 1765.18 speaker2  you know, in character. It's like, it's always what I want. So I'm never gonna cut you off. and everything else action wise, very slow.
1762.74 1768.42 speaker1  I've got no fucking clue, man. I was gonna ask.
1766.90 1774.92 speaker2  I will cut you off. Clark Bishop, it's your turn.
1773.00 1790.10 speaker1  I mean, can I keep searching for a thing that's 10 yards long? I don't know how to save a guy that's falling 10 yards away from me.
1787.82 1793.70 speaker2  Remember guys how I'm doing the huh thing?
1790.94 1795.82 speaker1  How to save a life.
1794.86 1811.70 speaker2  Huh? So yeah, Keith is in the fray falling down and Clark is looking through. Man, you could really, I mean, a cable car would be able to. Here's what I wanna do.
1809.02 1839.14 speaker1  I wanna look for something big and flat that might float down there and I could try and throw it under Keith to like stop his fall. No way. Fuck yes, dude.
1836.80 1858.86 speaker2  Joe just always has one set of dice Okay, cool. Well, what do you find?
1857.76 1867.90 speaker1  I'm picturing Titanic. I don't wanna throw this lifeboat of a door down there.
1866.14 1873.86 speaker2  It looks really light. I hold it up and show John.
1871.18 1886.46 speaker1  And I'm trying to motion that I'm wanting to throw it out. If you start throwing it at the end of your turn, I will, at the start of my turn, open up the door again
1884.62 1943.98 speaker2  John says that with his eyes Thomas just looked into the camera with big eyes. It's a shame Keith's gonna fall right into the water at the beginning of his next turn. All right, so it is Dawn's turn. Are you gonna just grab two-handed onto the railing? I consent.
1942.22 1959.22 speaker0  and all this action's happening. He starts chanting to himself,
1957.78 1975.58 speaker1  over and over again.
1971.86 1980.74 speaker2  Do you wanna describe grabbing onto this railing, Justin? I fuckin' grab it.
1979.14 1996.94 speaker0  Yeah, I fuckin' grab it, bro. I do what Keith did except I succeed. And I light a cigarette in my mouth while I'm doing it.
1995.74 2030.08 speaker1  In slow motion. Jon compelled as if, it's almost like he's sharing a will with Clark. He just knows to go to the door and he rolls a 64 on a 67. and, or down the wall, and a door-sized slot just opens right as the door goes flying through. Yes.
2028.64 2036.28 speaker2  I am not gonna lie, I was very much looking forward to Clark just throwing a door into the wall.
2035.16 2045.56 speaker1  Yeah, exactly.
2042.40 2048.96 speaker2  I'm glad you guys are succeeding, I guess.
2045.56 2061.36 speaker1  That, I mean, yeah, you've never seen Jon's eyes so big and he's just staring at Clark in disbelief.
2056.36 2132.28 speaker2  in the wall and begins making its way down to the water under Keith Vigna, Jack Russell is going to roll a naught 7 and he grabs on directly next to, it's like we get another shot of what just happened of the three men running and jumping where Keith goes, hits, falls, and immediately, Don grabs, and then immediately, Jack Russell grabs right next to Don and so the two of them are hanging from this railing. Jack Russell is just pulling himself up, going, oh, this is fucking shit. and Don is a chancy, chancy boy. Below the ball, you see these two twins, one with a bowl cut, the other one with a pig tail. They're running overalls. And each of them has a massive smile on their face and they reach into their little pockets in their overalls and they each pull out a lollipop.
2130.72 2144.36 speaker1  That was scary.
2139.72 2176.92 speaker2  Behind the ball, it's tendrils finding support in the silvery, shimmery sea, making this weird like, noise is going to fling some of the melting steel with one of its tendrils. It's going to splash. And it rolled a 23, like Michael Jordan. You'd never wanted to get in the pool with Michael, all time greatest splasher.
2175.12 2184.44 speaker1  He could do the thing where he puts his hands and squeezes them and it shoots right at your face. You know what I'm talking about?
2181.80 2246.00 speaker2  I do, my dad did that shit all the time. And this door made out of this black texture, this colorful black texture flying perfectly through the air to save Keith Vigna from falling into this metal gets completely engulfed. This melting steel wraps itself around this door and it is no longer the liquid that it was previously. It is now a metal door and the metal door falls,
2243.48 2276.52 speaker1  that my cargo shorts could act as parachutes in this crazy world we're in right now to slow my fall just a little bit? that he was about to kill you.
2273.28 2410.92 speaker2  Put a thumbs up if you think that Keith touches down into the metal sea and put a thumbs down if you think parachute shorts. Keith, your feet touch first. Okay. It's giving off no temperature change to the air around it but as your toes dip in, you can't feel anything at all and your mind goes completely numb and there's just this piercing noise The shock immediately changes as the rest of you slowly, slowly, agonizingly melts into this ocean. Up to your knees now, your shins are fully melting. You don't even know what it would be like inside of your shorts but you think your legs might just not even exist anymore. You're just becoming part of this ocean itself and your stomach hurts. Your mouth immediately has the taste of metal inside of it, blood and metal and you can smell butter. Smells like butter? And you will continue melting in on your next turn and by the end of your next turn, you will be fully submerged in the shimmering silver sea. Clark Bishop, it's your turn.
2408.68 2463.44 speaker1  Everything going good out there? Did he land on the door? That was good timing with you opening up that. We got him, right? High five me, man. John, weekly high fives you. Every week? This is our weekly high five. It may or may not be about what just happened with Keith, I may or may not have just seen one of the most horrific things I could ever hope to imagine as he may or may not have melted into the ocean. until it gets to his lungs and then it's just gurgles.
2460.88 2473.40 speaker3  See, he's so excited that he got caught by the door. He's so excited. He's screaming for joy, right?
2470.28 2501.44 speaker1  You did your bit as good as anyone could have asked you, but unforeseen circumstances came up and now he's being swallowed into that goo there. Yeah, yeah, that's his blubber. He was, you know, he was an inside boy.
2499.96 2505.44 speaker3  Are you telling me that Keith's dead?
2503.08 2514.64 speaker1  You can see him dying out there and screaming. So any idea you have is as good as. We still got time.
2513.16 2550.16 speaker3  We still got time. Clark is going to search through this magical room one more time for something long that he can throw out there to maybe pull him in with. God damn it, I can't find anything. It's an 82. There's so much junk in here, but it's also useless. You find a putter. How about this? A putter. Is it long enough? You just whang him on the head.
2548.80 2555.96 speaker1  Phone on me.
2554.64 2568.36 speaker2  Don D. Pettymore.
2563.36 2570.00 speaker0  Biza girl, biza girl, biza girl.
2568.88 2587.96 speaker1  That was three times.
2585.84 2712.80 speaker2  Yeah, you were all fools to worry. And as he's hanging, his chant begins reverberating through this entire place. You all feel yourselves freeze, both in space and in time. As the world begins to rewind. Oh my God. You feel yourselves moving backwards, making the exact same movements, only this time in reverse. in the piston bunk yard. Keith screams out. His legs exist once again. His stomach is content. The taste of blood in his mouth vanishes and the smell of butter melts away. and the shock dissipates. from out of the shimmering silver sea and flings off its steel covering to reveal a colorful black texture. The little twins put lollipops back in their wrappers and into their overalls. The unnaturally hued door sends a spray of liquid metal toward the feral ball that inhabited Julie Maxwell and then flies back up into the junkyard bunker just as John closes a hem made hole in the wall. Clark catches the door and promptly places it under some junk on the floor. Keith's body ascends toward the second stilted bunkers hatch and his sweaty hands grab and immediately release the railing as he is thrust backwards onto the rising bridge and time freezes once again
2710.28 2717.44 speaker1  before suddenly stumbling forward
2715.08 2731.20 speaker2  and Keith leaps toward the hatch, reaches out for the railing
2729.04 2739.52 speaker1  Oh well then it just happens again. Okay. It was a 48 on a 60 just so you know.
2738.36 2755.22 speaker2  Oh then we learn now. saves everyone in the world and podcasts over.
2754.40 2760.16 speaker1  That's the end. Good game. That was wild. That was a great ending.
2758.92 2767.60 speaker2  You guys wanna play again? I do. Like you mean like season two?
2766.40 2774.12 speaker3  Let's just do this again. Let's just start.
2772.08 2780.40 speaker1  Fucking right off the bat. Maggie, it's your birthday. You're under arrest. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. ["Livin' In"]
