0.00 267.70 speaker0  What's cooking my babies, it's your gumbo master wolf the dog, and I'm here on this early evening on December 6th to cook you up a fresh pot of goo. This gumbo was made with nothing but the discarded shells of river bugs, various types of blood, and celery. Mmm makes my tummy rumble just thinking about it, and my tummy is causing reverberations all throughout the galaxy live from 694.2 PTBP. Speaking of my tummy, I'm hungry for love, so you know what time it is. It's time for Howlin' with Wolf. This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Eric from New York, who writes, Hello Adam, I'm glad you're enjoying the podcast so far. If you've made it to this message it means you've probably passed where I am in the story. I hope baby Aurelia isn't too traumatized by this ultra-violent podcast. Love from New York, Eric. I admit my auditory secretions. not stop until my power is absolute. Coochie coochie coo, my little baby babies.

But you don't have to even ask questions to your old wolfie because I already have like Burt Macklin from the hit television series The National Broadcasting Company's Parks and Recreation. And then they said very few words before making it to the office of Bruce Robin, literally over the body of a stylish woman who was thriving in the city as a high-powered PA. Once inside, things did not go any better. Keith Victor claimed to be from a secret organization called Myriad. Bruce began chanting and reached for his gun. Clark Bishop dove over the table, knocking Bruce over backward in his chair and sending his handgun just out of reach. After a back-and-forth three-on-one fistfight except for the knives and guns, John Lee Kevin Moore the three-and-a-half looked away for just long enough for Bruce to finish his chant and fire his gun into his own head. Taking us now to the most happening place in the city, a fancy chief executive's penthouse office that is completely covered in a sequence of numbers I dare not repeat on these soundwaves written in the blood of the almost-billionaire Bruce Robin, it's a brand new track from your best of 2019 list's top artist, Kudzu, with the premiere of this tasty fuckin' jam, No
266.70 281.06 speaker1  Nope. We're coming up on that time where your friends realize how much you care about them.
280.06 298.30 speaker2  Yeah. Thomas is like, you don't know nervous. I don't know nervous either, which is why I do a lot of my shopping between the 22nd and 24th-ish.
293.68 299.54 speaker1  There was one year that I got like three things Christmas Eve and it was just fuckin' terrifying
298.30 303.98 speaker2  and awful. Like you received three presents on Christmas Eve and it was terrifying and awful.
302.98 317.46 speaker1  No. It was that I wouldn't get my gifts. Actually three ghosts.
315.60 322.46 speaker2  My mom, my dad, and my sister. That's it? Yep. So I'm not supposed to get you anything?
321.46 329.78 speaker1  Oh, I've gotten you guys.
328.78 375.34 speaker2  That's nice. Am I allowed to use Patreon money to get you guys Christmas gifts? That'd be a hard write off. So we were talking when we came in today before we started recording about the numbers. The Painfully Easy Cipher, I believe the episode was titled. And you guys did some work and figured out some of the... Translations. Translations. Even for some of the past numbers that have been in this show. Do you guys want to give a rundown of where you're at on that?
369.62 427.86 speaker1  Well, so it turned out to be a pretty simple, I think they call it an alphabet cipher? Is that what they call it? A substitution cipher. A substitution cipher. So the first ones in the apartment that was kind of ransacked and shitty we think say Harriet Marks, M-A-R-K-S, which is not a name that rings any bells for any of us. the name of the man that had just committed suicide in front of us. us of Marvin creatures standing on a mausoleum yelling at us. And he started spouting numbers. that turned out to spell overseer. And we asked... Yeah, that's nothing.
426.86 430.02 speaker2  You probably...
428.26 445.74 speaker1  I don't remember anything of it. And we also asked him who he was.
444.30 447.74 speaker2  I don't know what it means.
446.74 463.66 speaker1  So we did that off, Mike. We'll see how that comes out in character. I remember those numbers clearly.
462.66 480.58 speaker2  All over each other. And we're naked. Unclothed in the office of Bruce Robin, and you are surrounded... That was sick.
476.26 491.32 speaker1  Zach just hit a button on a remote, and the lights in this room turned red.
489.62 554.22 speaker2  You guys are surrounded by blood. It smells of deep iron and soulless humanity in this room. And the reason that you came to is because the two double doors leading into this office busted open, and three police officers come in as you come to. The officer in the back is a good-looking older man with gray hair, and I need Clark Joe, you recognize this man dressed as a city police officer as Leon Simpson of the circle of knowledge. What do you say? The man in the back drops a couple duffel bags on the ground and promptly puts three bullets in each of the other two from the back. They drop to the ground, and he walks into the hall behind him.
553.22 560.66 speaker1  Leon?
556.22 566.62 speaker2  You then hear a single gunshot from the hallway.
563.10 576.10 speaker1  He's, guys, he's with the circle, he's on our side. He's with Maggie, at least. He just killed two cops, though. We're three cops.
573.54 645.52 speaker2  I walk over to my clothes and put them back on. Covered in blood. Are you gonna wipe yourself off before you get your old clothes back on? is the least bloody. uniform with blood stained on the back of your back. Also, the blood that's on you is gonna seep into that material and stuff. But the gray-haired officer, Leon Simpson, walks back into the office, and he walks up to one of the duffel bags that he dropped on the ground and reaches in. his gun, walks over to Bruce Robin, places the gun in Bruce Robin's empty hand, and begins defacing any writing in the room with numbers on it. Essentially, he's just trying to clean it up and make the room look less esoteric and more murder-suicidy.
642.08 674.40 speaker1  Can we hear the bleed-through of sound from his headphones? He hasn't acknowledged us, right?
673.40 676.40 speaker2  What are you doing here?
675.40 692.44 speaker3  I gotta get out of here. He's got his headphones on. He's not paying attention.
691.12 717.28 speaker1  That has to be it. He's with a circle. He helped me before. You guys remember when I got those tranquilizer darts that helped us mind control? Yeah. I nod over to him. Got them from him. Oh. I'm gonna go and see if there's something, if I can open his duffel bag and see if there's anything else in there that might help in cleaning.
713.44 729.56 speaker2  But when you open it up, you see there's some stuff that you could use to help clean up. And then also in a second duffel bag, he has three city police officer uniforms that are clean and pressed.
726.28 746.68 speaker1  I wanna use cleaning supplies in the duffel bag to start cleaning myself. Yeah, I wanna do that too. Yeah, I'll divvy it out. And turn. And turn.
739.64 766.00 speaker2  And you guys see when Clark Bishop takes off his uniform and is cleaning himself off, there it is, that gaping hole in the middle of Clark Bishop's chest. But no matter how many times you look at, you can't get away from the fact that it's horrible. That's just this like skin tunnel that goes from front to back.
765.00 815.36 speaker1  Does it hurt? Doesn't hurt at all. Kinda hurts to look at. Yeah, it's pretty gross. Cool. Of course it bothers me when I look at it, but I don't know what to tell you. Just put a shirt on. It doesn't hurt when you just kinda touch it. You've done this before, John. I know you love touching my hole.
810.42 836.48 speaker2  Looking over at Leon Simpson, he's rifling through paperwork and he eventually finds something that he's clearly looking for and then he brings out a stamp and you notice that it is a stamp of Bruce Robin's signature that he is putting on this paperwork and he's flipping through pages and stamping the bottom right of like every third page.
834.64 852.84 speaker1  anything from those documents he's stamping.
847.28 885.36 speaker2  I'd like to search for like a personal checkbook or anything like that in Bruce Robin's effects. What's it say? There's some more numbers. She broke me open and all new things have the power to escort change in the future of good in order to break. Hold on, I'm not reading this right. I hate paying the syntax.
879.92 897.20 speaker3  While he's reading that eye rifle through the duffel bag, seeing if there's a belt because whoever these clothes are for is much larger than me.
889.72 944.96 speaker2  You can find a belt off one of the dead officers that doesn't have blood all over it so you can get a second belt going. Sweet. She broke me open and all new things have the power to escort change in the future of good in order to break the cycle and find fulfillment in an unquestioning goodness that breaks the relentless tether holding this lie of a world withstanding itself. I can smell my past. I can hear the future. I am joy. I am destruction. I am pure. Harriet. 8-11-8-1-8-9-5-2-0-13-11-8-1-1-1-1-9. Probably not a zero in there, but that's a 20. We got that number before. I don't know if we've done anything with it yet.
943.20 970.20 speaker1  Out of character, that is Harriet Marks.
969.20 981.24 speaker2  Adam West?
980.20 993.28 speaker3  It sure is.
992.28 1093.88 speaker2  real quick. Joe, when Clark Bishop pulls out his phone, if you pull out the burner phone, you see a text that you've received from the same number as before. And it says, the book your parents died for is still hidden in an undisclosed location. Unfortunately she recently committed suicide in her dorm room. She is known as an organizer and an activist working for pro-union groups. She would have been a political science major. I'd like to go on some of the more elaborate conspiracy theory boards that John Lee Pettymore follows. Absolutely. And see if any of them are talking about Harriet Marks. Roll a cult for me. Woo! Oh, not unnatural, just a cult. Gotcha. Okay, well I failed. just saying, like, there were discrepancies within the police report about her suicide. Just asking questions!
1091.08 1100.12 speaker1  Yeah, they wouldn't tell you in a news article how the suicide occurred.
1097.36 1130.08 speaker2  Did you know that Harriet Marks showed every sign? Did you know that... Jokes are about the journey.
1128.08 1141.44 speaker1  You ever heard of Harriet Marks? Yeah. Who is she to you and us?
1136.52 1147.96 speaker2  We really gotta get going, but yeah, she's clearly earlier on in the thread, and then he puts his headphones back on.
1146.96 1154.32 speaker1  He helped me earlier.
1153.32 1156.32 speaker3  I do that too.
1155.32 1202.00 speaker2  Cleaning montage finish? Red juices are just like falling to the floor, like mixed with like suds from those like handy wipes that come in small little packages that people keep in their purses and bags and such. And you guys finally wipe off the very last bit of blood from your hands, and the little wet nap is just like completely covered in blood, and you throw the very last one into the trash duffel bag. Oh, absolutely. It just like cuts to it, but the lights keep like flashing all crazy like during those moments.
1197.88 1223.54 speaker3  Also, at one point, Keith takes a plastic glove and puts it over his head and blows Howie Mandel style.
1216.18 1249.46 speaker2  freshly pressed and very clean, and Leon Simpson picks up the bags and throws in some paperwork into one of the duffels that's not full of the disgusting blood nappies. Along with your uniforms, you each have a service pistol. And you hear sirens, and he runs over to the window looking down on the city, and from 17 floors up, you see six police cars roll up to the front.
1248.46 1255.26 speaker3  Lead the way. After you.
1254.26 1263.90 speaker1  I would hope so, yeah. I'll put them on. And then real fast as we enter the hall, oh, did you just say enter the hallway? Enter the hallway.
1261.10 1336.40 speaker2  As you guys enter the hallway, there's a distinct smell. What does it smell like? It smells like dead Winifred. She has exhumed her bowels, and Leon does not pay any mind as he walks right over her to the stairwell on the far side of the elevator and begins walking down the stairs. The stairs go down to the 12th floor, and when you get to the 12th floor, you have to exit and go into the hallway, and it seems to be like an accounting floor. There's no one at this point. All the lights are off. You see a cleaning person on the far side away from you, and you guys just walk over to the next set of stairs on the other side and begin to head down. I need whoever has the lowest luck to roll luck for me. I have 35.
1335.40 1381.08 speaker3  That's me. 70.
1379.64 1396.36 speaker2  I'm not going to answer them. So yeah, we were literally, we came from a pig farm.
1392.20 1404.56 speaker3  I want to use disguise to just act like a cop. Yeah, I'd like to use being a cop to act like a cop.
1403.56 1406.56 speaker2  Hell yeah.
1405.56 1407.56 speaker3  Can I just roll law to do that?
1406.56 1411.56 speaker0  Yeah, absolutely.
1410.56 1413.56 speaker3  Damn it.
1412.56 1420.32 speaker1  85 on a 60.
1414.56 1470.34 speaker2  So you guys are like halfway down, and he turns and he's like, you guys are walking weird. We're going to have to take an elevator. And he dips out of the stairwell into a new hallway where it's another floor that's empty. You know, the lights are off. Nobody's there. It's Saturday. And also Bruce Robin gave pretty much everyone the day off and the weeks off. So there's no one in the building essentially. So you hit the elevator and as you get to the very bottom, you see, as soon as the elevator door opens, the security guard and the secretary who are sitting in the foyer of this large building and the security guard makes direct eye contact with you guys and then grabs his radio and then takes off running in the opposite direction. Clark, you're first act if you would like to do this in combat order.
1468.66 1476.82 speaker1  I'd like to follow his lead as much as possible.
1475.66 1482.98 speaker2  You can see him. He's already like reaching for his gun.
1481.98 1502.28 speaker1  Then I'm reaching for mine. I'm not going to shoot.
1497.10 1525.04 speaker2  His radio is in one of his hands, hands that are slowly raising into the air. You know, like you do when a cop yells at you. It's now Leon's turn. Oh shit. Okay. So he aims his pistol and as soon as the bullet fires, you hear a coming from the radio as if it was an aerosol can that got shot with a BB gun. Luke, what are you doing?
1523.32 1558.12 speaker3  I don't see it exactly hit. So I'd fire on the guy as well. Go ahead and roll firearms. 61 on a 70. One.
1555.60 1560.12 speaker2  a finger and now it's not on his hand anymore.
1559.12 1565.00 speaker3  He's like, dang.
1563.04 1570.04 speaker2  What is John Lee Pettymore doing? He's going to try to shoot this guy.
1566.84 1584.12 speaker3  Oh fuck, 74 on a 60.
1580.24 1614.28 speaker2  And he dips like full blown runs to the entrance. You actually see that there is only two police officers within sight outside on the other you guys. So Leon stops short about 10 feet in front of the revolving door.
1613.28 1617.28 speaker3  We need backup. Did you hear those gunshots?
1616.28 1660.04 speaker2  Awesome. Yep. They immediately start talking to each other and then they're going to take cover behind and there's another stairwell on that side with an exit door head through there and into the mid evening on December 6th in the city.
1659.04 1662.04 speaker1  Yeah.
1661.04 1682.20 speaker2  You guys all get in the car. Leon gets in the driver's seat and as soon as he puts the pedal to the metal, you hear a whoop whoop and baby, we got a motherfucking car chase. These two dudes who are outside definitely recognize that you weren't officers got into
1681.20 1709.08 speaker3  hundred. How good of a driver are you? What'd you say? a, the rally driving teams do. Hell yeah. That's dope. Sweet.
1708.08 1711.08 speaker2  Bishop's turn.
1710.08 1713.08 speaker1  Hunker down.
1712.08 1714.08 speaker2  Okay.
1713.08 1722.40 speaker1  Go ahead and roll stealth.
1720.04 1745.26 speaker2  You just can not get your legs. So like those whole backseat is just filled with like a bunch of tactical gear and all And there's all these things that are in the floorboards. So your feet can't occupy that space and it's making your head stick up in the window in the back.
1743.72 1766.16 speaker3  Is there a shotgun back here? I grab it, roll the window down and shoot at the driver. All right. Oof.
1763.28 1776.00 speaker2  But thankfully there are no pedestrians around. You absolutely can.
1775.00 1796.88 speaker3  Okay. 43 on a 70. All right.
1792.58 1822.72 speaker2  And as you guys pass, you see just like all these kids with their nasty grubby little fingers on the windows, just like looking down like, oh wow. And like give him a wink. It cuts into slow-mo as John Lee Pettymore winks at them out the window. And then it immediately goes back into normal speed as the car just dips away right before the police car behind just slams into the school bus about halfway in between the middle. Oh no.
1821.72 1836.00 speaker3  I manifested that guys. I just put what I wanted out into the universe and that's the secret.
1835.00 1843.72 speaker2  Got a 55. That's you. Go ahead and roll that luck baby. This is to see if another police car is within the area.
1842.72 1845.72 speaker1  That's a hundo.
1844.72 1851.28 speaker3  I saw the zero zero and I was like. At ease.
1847.72 1855.72 speaker2  Two police cars immediately are on your tail.
1851.28 1859.04 speaker3  Good thing school's just getting out. Clark Bishop.
1856.72 1864.34 speaker2  We just learned a great trick.
1860.22 1873.34 speaker1  Can I look through the stuff that's in the back seat here for anything that I could throw that they would hit that would make their car fucked up.
1872.34 1877.02 speaker2  Roll search for me. You have a great search.
1874.34 1893.46 speaker1  I got a 20. I do not pass. Take that.
1891.82 1910.34 speaker3  I want to aim the shotgun. I want to shoot one of the flip flops out of the air and then shoot at the driver of the closest car.
1907.78 1913.98 speaker1  We're a traveling circus act.
1910.34 1933.18 speaker3  What just demonstrates that we're accurate and we have ammunition to spare. Nine.
1931.00 1946.62 speaker2  like through the middle of it. And then another fire just eviscerates the flip flop on the windshield as the windshield busts out and you see a spray of blood. Oh. Oh.
1945.62 1967.18 speaker3  Intimidated them to death. Roll 2D6. I'm so sorry. Yeah. I let him borrow a 2D6. I'll take those back and burn them in shame. Oh yeah.
1961.62 1974.62 speaker2  The officer turns on the windshield wipers and you see that it wasn't blood that sprayed. They were holding a red smoothie of some sort in front of them that happened to explode. And a jelly doughnut.
1973.62 1984.14 speaker3  Yeah. Oh my god.
1981.10 1994.30 speaker2  And now they're real mad. But he's going to take a negative twenty on the next drive check so Thomas would you like to attempt the same thing or are you going to do something different?
1993.30 2011.18 speaker3  Fuck. So some.
2005.58 2051.72 speaker2  have got the red light and he punches it as a semi goes right behind him and it takes out one of the cop cars just like rams directly into the trailer of the semi pretty much taking off the entire top of the car. However you see the second police car fly around the semi and it's still on your tail. Go ahead and.
2050.28 2063.14 speaker1  and try to shoot out a tire. Alright roll firearms. Nice. A pass.
2062.14 2067.00 speaker2  attempt.
2064.14 2109.12 speaker3  I'm doing the same thing shooting at the driver again. Good pass. Nice. Well what I do is I aim the shotgun at the passenger kill him and then just chuck the shotgun at the driver and we're going fast enough that it just impales the driver through the head. rolling and then yeah stops.
2107.12 2113.00 speaker1  And then it explodes.
2112.00 2123.44 speaker3  Hell yeah. Absolutely.
2122.44 2126.44 speaker1  Yeah. I think they implied. I heard them say that.
2125.44 2132.68 speaker3  Let's tell ourselves that.
2131.16 2142.96 speaker1  in Marvin's pocket you're correct.
2139.24 2155.60 speaker3  indiscriminately we can just do that all over the streets of the city.
2152.48 2189.20 speaker2  out in your minds or whether you're just saying it out loud. No. When it would be the reason for the sanity is an emotional reason because Keith Vigna
2186.96 2233.32 speaker3  has no empathy in his body.
2223.72 2268.18 speaker2  is calming down you notice Clark Bishop and John Lee Pettymore begun diving into themselves mentally and they both begin murmuring and muttering 2 1 8 2 1 3 5 1 8 1 5 2 9 1 4. You recognize it as the sequence. You are all writing upstairs in the office of Bruce Robin that you have translated and this man I believe Clark told you his name is Leon Simpson. He looks at you.
2267.18 2305.80 speaker3  You're not. Okay so we got one of you. We've seen it. Marks I think let me think and I you know like jot down what I can remember of that number and start doing the same thing and I'm it says Bruce Robin.
2302.88 2318.38 speaker2  They're just repeating Bruce Robin over and over? Yeah.
2312.64 2336.64 speaker3  of it but I just kind of snapped out of it and and you know woke up just covered in blood and we looked like we'd written that all over the walls. I don't know. I mean obviously we killed Bruce. I don't know why they're chanting it though. He shot himself? He shot himself. Okay.
2335.64 2353.68 speaker2  Yeah with his with his gun. Because it made it look like a suicide before I came in and made it look like a murder suicide.
2352.36 2364.32 speaker3  I'm Leon by the way. How did. Oh you're you're Fergie's brother? Yeah.
2362.32 2367.52 speaker2  That must have been a hell of a childhood. It wasn't fun.
2366.52 2377.60 speaker3  How did you know him?
2376.60 2386.88 speaker2  No.
2385.88 2416.18 speaker3  Yeah. I just thought he. What is Bar Corp? Was Bruce Robin in the circle of knowledge?
2410.18 2525.50 speaker2  You know it's it's probably better that you learn this from someone else but your your brother is a I mean he's a dick but he's a good man you know he's he's working he's trying to keep the or he was trying to keep the world safe in a way in his own way in our own way but more and more I'm starting to question whether or not our version of the world is worth saving. right in front of you I just got a hold of these he hands you a file folder full of pictures he's like I got these recently from the investigation in on Harriet Marks's apparent suicide I mean you can see for yourself spray-painted all over her dorm room one five two two five one he looks in his rearview mirror at Clark Bishop who is mumbling these numbers to himself
2518.82 2544.40 speaker3  was a picture of a drawing of somebody in a hood and and written scrawled in there over and over and over again was that like what do you know that from?
2537.32 2579.52 speaker2  been more than a man or if it's just his future or destiny or I don't even know if I believe in that anymore but your your partner Clark Bishop looking at him still through the rearview existed I don't know how to tell you this but Clark Bishop is the overseer and he will circle of knowledge How can you have enough drowning out of the circle of knowledge
