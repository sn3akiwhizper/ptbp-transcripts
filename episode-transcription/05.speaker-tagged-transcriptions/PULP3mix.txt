137.26 248.20 speaker0  then friendship ended with Zelda, now Link is my best friend, of explicit or understood regulations or principles governing conduct within a particular activity or sphere? Hi, rule. Fuck Ganondorf Dragmire, it's time for the news. Last time, Elden Ring ended up dancin' with a woman whose mind was already owned by some force greater than Elden had ever met, such force that Chequers, Elden's leader, had to pull out smell insults to bring the psychic back to reality. Lafayette J. Honeycutt teased his own invention as he and his man, Harvey Brewer, climbed up a frozen ladder to the top of the tower flyin' through the winter storm and toward the house. But at the very end of the last episode, Elden Ring basically pledged allegiance to this unimaginable power that has taken hold of the guests here, and when Chequers brought him back again the changed psychic stared into the pitch black eyes of Reverend Nye, who winked. If that doesn't give you shivers, in your jaw and shoulders. Here, maybe this'll help. It's Isabelle Crane with Hollow.
244.20 304.20 speaker1  before its blood ran cold. through tissue and faggot bone. You were hollow when you spoke to me. so I gave you everything.
301.20 339.20 speaker3  Psychic attack, psychic attack, psychic attack! There's not someone in your closet you don't have to check. But there is somebody in the backseat of your car. Listen to podcasts while driving, cut this bit.
336.20 343.20 speaker2  Put in honking noises. Yeah, put in sirens. Sirens.
341.20 350.20 speaker3  Oh my god, that happened to me the other day. It made me so angry and it was another actual play. That wasn't fun for me. It scared me.
349.20 364.20 speaker2  I don't like cops. Get a job, cop!
358.20 377.20 speaker3  And we are here in the pretending to be people episode Oh, my pleasure, gents. My pleasure. How do you think it's going so far?
373.20 388.20 speaker2  It's accelerating nicely and I am looking forward to doing horrible things to all of you. Nice! Yeah, we're gonna die.
383.20 397.20 speaker3  Hey, Zach, big thanks for taking that huge luck hit for me in the last one. I'm a team player. What are you at now? I am down to two. No, I'm just kidding. I have 51. Oh, shit. After all that?
396.20 400.20 speaker2  You'll be fine. You had mad luck. Okay.
399.20 403.20 speaker3  Yeah, 65 luck. Wow.
401.20 420.20 speaker2  You won't need luck for anything else in this scenario.
418.20 440.20 speaker3  You need to start doing more crazy shit. So, yeah, last time we left off, you guys were in the tower. Destroying. and the secret was it was set up to receive some kind of alien transmissions.
439.20 467.20 speaker2  Or send, I think. Send, okay, yes. Yeah, meanwhile, Checkers is chatting it up with an heiress to a fortune. Yeah, the senator still haven't talked to him.
464.20 474.20 speaker3  Have yet to talk to the senator from Vermont.
473.20 479.20 speaker2  Why, Zach?
477.20 509.20 speaker3  Use it or lose it. I think it's a really fun joke. I mean, literally anything else. All right, I'll be literally anything else.
503.20 519.20 speaker2  When we go back and listen to this, every time Elden Ring is said, it's just Scott introducing himself.
518.20 631.20 speaker3  It's a me. Or you could just call me Kief, since that's like... If you have been hitting some character moments with that in mind that have made Joe and I almost wet our pants. It's been a really fun experience. I'm happy to have such a delightful cult leader to be playing alongside, as well as a crew of two that no one should outdo the brewer and whichever name you're going by. David Ellington, or is he just Birth Dave? Yeah, it's very familiar for you two to call me Dave. specifically Margaret Payne, the philanthropist, reached into her mind and was met once again with a voice that basically enlisted Elden Ring to make sure that the partygoers know that nothing should go off without a hitch this evening, that Mardant's new invention should be well received, and that everyone should know it's going to change the world, you know. Did you forget the word reverent? The fucking religion man.
628.20 651.20 speaker2  Doing Keef from the Righteous Gemstones. When he says that to Checkers, immediately he's- Okay. I did say that.
648.20 656.20 speaker3  And you meant it, but now you have no choice. I really don't.
655.20 675.20 speaker2  Scott, is this cool? If you're both happy with this, I am absolutely ecstatic. I'm fine with it, yeah.
674.20 724.20 speaker1  90 as well. Checkers can feel, yeah, for some reason, Eldin has turned against you, it seems. He is trying to implant these thoughts in your head. But at the same time, he has at least implanted some of them so that perhaps you can feel that he really wants you to go out there and convince everyone else at the party that Mordin's adventure
721.20 745.20 speaker2  Yeah, so I can feel that he's done this to me. Eldin, what is the invention? It's going to change the world, you know? Checkers starts backing up a little bit, and he wants to get the fuck out of this room. He doesn't want to be around psychic attacks.
744.20 752.20 speaker3  Checkers!
749.20 759.20 speaker2  He runs out the front into the snow. How far away is the tower from me right now?
757.20 803.20 speaker1  Yeah, you can see the outline of it. If you're looking around just trying to get your bearings there in the snow, you can give me a spot to hit and roll. but you can't even make out the outline of the tower now. There's a few feet of snow, it seems, that have fallen since you've been in there. The cars are partly buried under the snow now, and you can't even see any footprints out here now. It's all been covered up.
799.20 836.20 speaker2  and Checkers is thinking, I just need to get inside, but not around all the crazy people that are in there. He remembers when he got poked in the eye by his pencil that they were passing a tower, so he wants to go in the direction that he thinks the tower is. Fuck yeah.
831.20 858.20 speaker1  you make your way through the whipping snow, and you do eventually find yourself at the base of this structure. You can make out the general shape of it now that you're underneath it, but the visibility has dropped almost nothing now.
855.20 878.20 speaker2  and he's like, oh, I think there might be ice on this, so he gives it a little lick, and yeah, sure enough. It tastes cold. but he's going to try to carefully make his way up because he's freezing cold right now, so he just wants to get inside somewhere.
876.20 909.20 speaker1  It is not a pleasant climb. Every rung is now more and more slippery as you're going up, and the wind is pulling at your clothing a couple of times. You're really having to hold on tight to stop yourself being blown off, but somehow you do make it up to this trapdoor, and from the other side of the trapdoor, you can hear the sound of things being smashed.
906.20 913.20 speaker3  and the grunts of a brute.
909.20 925.20 speaker2  Yeah, that terrifies Checkers, but he's freezing cold, and the only option is climbing back down this, and he's not going to do that, so he...
920.20 928.20 speaker3  I think you might recognize this Lafayette in the screens.
925.20 947.20 speaker2  As I'm trying to decide whether I climb back down to get away from this scary sound, I hear him say something. I'm like, oh, I think that's the scientist, and I pop in.
945.20 957.20 speaker3  Fellas? Enjoying the party?
956.20 1008.20 speaker2  We're kind of busy here. You can read, though, right? Of course. I'm going to look around. That's a fail on my spot hidden, so I'm going to grab... What's something shitty that would be up here? Just kick something, Checkers. I don't know, just smash, smash, Checkers, smash. I start using my fists and feet to... I'm not really sure what I'm doing, but there's a big guy. There's these two guys and a really big one telling me to do this. I'm just going to do it.
1004.20 1014.20 speaker3  so I'm going to start flipping switches while I'm punching buttons and stuff.
1013.20 1016.20 speaker1  Yeah, there's no power.
1014.20 1037.20 speaker3  Yeah, we smashed it up good. It broke. Cool, I bet that was loud.
1033.20 1046.20 speaker2  He hasn't really had an outlet for his frustration in a while, so in his coked-up brain, he's like, yeah, fuck this place, and he pulls out a lighter.
1044.20 1057.20 speaker3  He's going to try to just set something on fire.
1055.20 1071.20 speaker2  Yeah, 25 on a 32.
1068.20 1079.20 speaker3  You set an attainable goal and you achieved that goal.
1076.20 1082.20 speaker2  I'm like, look, and just point at one of the fires.
1079.20 1097.20 speaker3  Harvey looks over and is surprised how into it you've gotten, but then notices the fire. Whoa, buddy, maybe too much there.
1094.20 1114.20 speaker1  It's caught onto some of the insulation of the wiring and there's a bit of thick black smoke that is now pooling into the air,
1109.20 1121.20 speaker3  He's taking a heavy breather, and he thinks it's hilarious that... I keep wanting to call you Chuckles.
1119.20 1135.20 speaker2  You surely can. but I do think we should probably get a move on pretty quickly now.
1130.20 1152.20 speaker3  and he wants to steal the most advanced thing, intact thing he can, like an antenna, maybe the most alien-looking deal. and I'm going to reverse-engineer your technology.
1150.20 1179.20 speaker1  I mean, you've smashed the place up. You could open up a window and lean out and try to unscrew one of them,
1176.20 1194.20 speaker3  Harvey's just going to do a smash with a fist through a window
1190.20 1268.20 speaker1  to see whether you can do this without destroying the antenna You've managed to wrench this antennae away. I mean, you've got bits of it in your hand, I'll say that you take only one hit point of damage from this, or at least running down your arm, and your hand's getting a bit sticky and slick from it. It might occur to you that this is perhaps suboptimal for your climb down again. It'll take you a bit of time to bind the wound, and that fire is beginning to spray. If you want to take the time out in the burning building to bind the wound up, you certainly can.
1263.20 1282.20 speaker2  with his 1% in medicine, he holds his lighter up.
1279.20 1300.20 speaker3  that's never left his hand this whole time, and he's looking at the flames, and he's like,
1297.20 1326.20 speaker1  fleeing the burning cabin, so I think this is where I start asking for rolls. Okay. I'll give you a choice as to whether to make a dex or a climb roll, whichever is better, but what I will say is that, as Lafayette is carrying his suitcase, I'm going to ask for a hard dig.
1322.20 1331.20 speaker3  Well, my dex is 30, and I rolled a 36.
1329.20 1365.20 speaker1  You've got a number of rungs down, but now that you're trying to get down fast, these rungs are really quite slick, and you realize that you're not going to be able to get down
1362.20 1373.20 speaker3  And rocket man away from the fucking conflagration.
1371.20 1386.20 speaker1  50 or 60 mile per hour winds, on this icy ladder under a burning building,
1383.20 1390.20 speaker3  Sounds simple, easy, and yeah, that's what he does.
1386.20 1397.20 speaker2  His design is as ergonomic as it is brilliant. Okay.
1395.20 1404.20 speaker1  let's just make this an ordinary Dex roll.
1403.20 1408.20 speaker3  Okay.
1407.20 1417.20 speaker1  And what is your plan? Are you just leaping into the wind from there, or are you trying to just slow your descent? What are you doing?
1414.20 1423.20 speaker3  He licks a finger and holds it out and gauges, like, before it gets, like, whipped away by the 50 mile an hour wind.
1421.20 1433.20 speaker2  He says, it is cold.
1429.20 1454.20 speaker3  He gauges the direction of the wind and leaps off with it and ignites the jet pack and tries to, you know, he doesn't want to fight the storm. He wants to rise with it into the air. Riders on the storm.
1451.20 1474.20 speaker1  So I think we'll come back to you in a moment. Okay, perfect. But let's deal with the other two first. So you're in this burning structure, and you've just seen Lafayette down below you on the ladder
1472.20 1478.20 speaker3  Yeah, Lafayette is like, we gotta get out of here. Deuces.
1475.20 1485.20 speaker2  Can I assume that it's on fire enough that, like, it's a pretty well lit... It's well lit. I'm well lit, bro. Yeah, yeah.
1483.20 1494.20 speaker1  I think the darkness is the least of your problems.
1490.20 1502.20 speaker2  and I look at Harvey before we can even have the conversation I'm going down.
1499.20 1520.20 speaker3  light up and start to take off, and he's, Harvey's going to start trying to get down the ladder also.
1518.20 1524.20 speaker2  Yeah, as soon as I go down, I...
1522.20 1528.20 speaker3  We need you in the group. Yeah.
1527.20 1533.20 speaker2  Yeah.
1531.20 1563.20 speaker1  So I think checkers, first of all, let's have a dex roll from checkers to see how well you're clambering down the ladder. OK, so you're going down fine. I mean, it's slow going because, again, you're having to, every now and then, just hug onto the ladder for dear life to stop being blown off. I'm going to ask for a hard dex roll because of the injury.
1562.20 1571.20 speaker2  It's a fail fail. 62 on a 50.
1567.20 1594.20 speaker1  the blood's dripping down off your arm and your hand's slick. Every now and then, because of the blood in your hand, it's actually freezing.
1591.20 1601.20 speaker3  and pull it down further so that he's not having the blood contact with the rail.
1598.20 1663.20 speaker1  Let's treat this as a push roll so there will be really bad consequences if you fail. But I'll say it because you're doing that. If you want to make a strength roll. No, this just needed to be a hard. So yes, you do manage to tug it down. I mean, that's not quite stopped the bleeding, but it slowed it down enough that the blood isn't going to be quite as much of an impediment. painfully down to the ground. Is it that kind of damage? No, you lost the one before for slashing your arm up, but that's it. But the rest of it, I mean, it's largely cosmetic damage. Your hand hurts a bit from endorsing a bit of the skin off
1662.20 1672.20 speaker3  You could do some stuff.
1671.20 1683.20 speaker2  Google it. Oh yeah.
1679.20 1697.20 speaker1  from the 1930s, they could do latent fingerprints off fabrics and stuff like that. No, that's really cool.
1695.20 1705.20 speaker2  then immediately forgot the information.
1702.20 1737.20 speaker1  else two days back that required that knowledge, so nice. So let's cut back to the inside of the manor where Mr. It's going to change the world, you know? most of the people that you're telling that to are telling the same G5 back.
1733.20 1757.20 speaker3  It's going to change the world, you know? It's going to change the world, you know? Wait, I'm sorry. We can do this. Yeah, we can do it.
1756.20 1762.20 speaker2  No, we can't.
1759.20 1764.20 speaker3  It's going to change the world.
1762.20 1787.20 speaker2  It's going to change the world.
1784.20 1796.20 speaker1  is so taken with your number that they're actually joining in. Yes.
1795.20 1805.20 speaker3  God. under the same thrall that I'm under?
1802.20 1846.20 speaker1  I mean, you're sort of sounding people out. Totally. It's through your call and response method. Money. I'm sorry. I don't know who else to ask, but I'm getting more and more worried about Cicero. How's he going to be able to change the world with his invention? And it is going to change the world, you know. Oh, of course. It's going to change the world, you know. Where is he? I'm getting worried. I mean, what, two hours into the party now?
1844.20 1852.20 speaker3  and says, we must go find him. We must. We must.
1850.20 1856.20 speaker1  And she grabs you by the hand and leads you out to the ballroom.
1855.20 1871.20 speaker2  Quick question. Like the people in the house, are there like windows that they would be seeing, like the fire?
1869.20 1886.20 speaker1  you know, so distracted by the party and if it weren't so difficult to see it through the really thick snowstorm that's going on outside, they might've noticed. But as it is at the moment, no.
1884.20 1902.20 speaker3  I just lost my best friend, you know,
1900.20 1916.20 speaker2  as Checkers is going down the ladder, he's thinking, we could pivot, we could pivot. No, he's thinking, he's like, the cult can just be whatever his invention is.
1915.20 1919.20 speaker3  Oh, nice. Like, I don't care.
1917.20 1933.20 speaker2  I don't believe in the bullshit I'm peddling.
1930.20 1981.20 speaker1  and I haven't managed to find him yet. I was going to check upstairs, but I just, I wanted some company because, well. but I saw one of the maids upstairs, just in the glooms, I was heading upstairs, and there was something very wrong with her. and, oh, this is going to sound mad.
1980.20 2004.20 speaker3  That's completely normal. Too many legs. Yeah, that's a spooky name. And he starts picturing a maid with multiple legs. I think you triggered something in me.
2001.20 2015.20 speaker2  I'm thinking like the lusty Argonian maid.
2012.20 2043.20 speaker3  Sometimes we see things that don't look right, and our brain rationalizes them so that we can understand the physical realm as it is in the spiritual. You'll be okay.
2038.20 2048.20 speaker1  and pats you on the back of the hand.
2046.20 2065.20 speaker3  where he's got two fingers up on either hand, and he's like putting them to his temples.
2060.20 2076.20 speaker1  Margaret taking the lead, and the hallway up above, I mean, there's a landing, first of all, but there's a hallway that runs along for the landing that goes down the main wing of the house.
2073.20 2107.20 speaker3  I will go ahead and make sure the coast is clear. you know, with the shirt holding.
2104.20 2127.20 speaker1  there's a set of double doors that look like they're
2123.20 2142.20 speaker3  and I would not like to spend the luck, but I would like to get on my hands and knees and crawl at a brisk pace to try to get closer, undetected, to listen better.
2138.20 2154.20 speaker1  Okay, yeah, if you want to push the roll.
2153.20 2162.20 speaker3  Okay. Nice.
2158.20 2203.20 speaker1  and Margaret looks a bit confused by this As you're passing by one of the doors, you can hear what sounds like howling wind from the other side of the door. and there's the sound of wind outside, and the wind's got in, the door itself is shaking.
2201.20 2209.20 speaker3  or would you like to continue to stay behind me?
2206.20 2226.20 speaker1  I mean, that's Cicero's room up ahead, she says. Do you think it's important that the window's open?
2224.20 2244.20 speaker3  I turn back and I say, well, he might not be in his room, it might lead us to learn more, to be able to help him or find him, so I think we should open up the door.
2241.20 2247.20 speaker2  And it's the bug brain from Starship Troopers, and Neil Patrick Harris touches it and says,
2246.20 2259.20 speaker3  it's afraid. That's also from that movie. I haven't seen it. So yeah, we're going to creep into the door. I know, I haven't seen it. Oh, you're going to love it.
2258.20 2262.20 speaker1  while you heard the wind.
2261.20 2266.20 speaker3  Nice.
2264.20 2298.20 speaker1  and there is a bit of resistance. And yeah, as you push it open, you realize, yeah, it is because there's wind blowing in from outside. There's also snow on the ground. With the window open, snow has been coming in, and there's a fair bit of it. This looks like it's probably a guest bedroom. It's made up as such. I mean, it's certainly a bedroom and there are sheets on the bed. Everything's dark, however, and you can only make out vague shapes of furniture and the snow on the ground.
2296.20 2312.20 speaker3  My warmth is on the inside. so he's just going to kind of get up and pop around.
2311.20 2314.20 speaker1  Gotcha.
2312.20 2325.20 speaker3  So he's going to whisper into the darkness, is anyone cold? And Margaret from behind, he says,
2323.20 2341.20 speaker2  Okay, forget my ignorance, but in 1937, would you be able to just turn the lights on? Yes. Okay, that helps me going into more of this.
2337.20 2384.20 speaker3  If no one responds to my query other than Margaret Payne, Elden Ring stands up. that would be good, but if not, I mean, Cicero, if you're, okay, we're just going to, bye, bye, I'm talking to no one. He's, Margaret Payne, I'm speaking to no one, and he heads back out into the hallway. you could give me a spot hidden role
2381.20 2408.20 speaker1  you can see that over by the window, that had blown in, a mound of snow on the ground. That is someone lying there very still.
2406.20 2414.20 speaker3  Are you cold?
2412.20 2424.20 speaker2  I did not see you.
2422.20 2477.20 speaker3  Escalators cannot be broken. And he's gonna, he's just gonna stare. Temporarily? Sorry for the convenience, podcast listeners. Do you know anything about the first aid skills? paying other people to be good at helping others, then you would know how to help someone yourself. And he moves on to the body.
2475.20 2506.20 speaker2  That's a physical description. He didn't apply any emotions to the eye.
2502.20 2530.20 speaker1  In the gloom, you can make out that it does seem to be the body of a young woman. She just seems to be in her undergarments lying there in the snow, and you can see that there's blood soaked into the snow around her head. You should look her to see if she's cold.
2528.20 2583.20 speaker3  This dead girl tastes cold. To solve this mystery, I'm gonna need two things. A hammer and a whole army. I'm going to grab some cloth drapes if I see anything around to just throw over the body immediately. while I connect with this lady intellectually? Yeah, I think so. There's only one way to find out.
2581.20 2592.20 speaker2  but maybe you'll die.
2589.20 2621.20 speaker3  in Pulp Cathedral. You're a loser. Your character is the vessel through which this story gets to feel very cool, but yeah, you are whatever dark force is working through this home, absolute bitch. to see if she's still alive, because I don't know anything about first aid.
2619.20 2635.20 speaker1  just in case you rolled a double zero. Okay, yeah, she's dead. There's nothing there to probe.
2633.20 2645.20 speaker2  Yeah, 404.
2644.20 2647.20 speaker3  Yeah, there's a murderer.
2645.20 2651.20 speaker1  Maybe Cicero's in danger as well. Oh my goodness.
2650.20 2677.20 speaker3  Let's go. That is our first priority.
2674.20 2682.20 speaker2  sometimes they find people have taken their clothes off. Well, Margaret Payne,
2679.20 2712.20 speaker3  sometimes when people are dying of hypothermia, like she did in the cold, they have a strange reaction that makes them take off their clothes. It's science. I'm not sure it's real.
2710.20 2733.20 speaker2  Sherlock Holmes says,
2729.20 2748.20 speaker1  His invention is going to change the world, you know.
2746.20 2752.20 speaker2  You want to get on all fours again?
2750.20 2771.20 speaker3  We can crawl if you want to. We can leave that old corpse behind. Because if the old corpse isn't necessary to the mission, then it's no friend of mine.
2767.20 2802.20 speaker1  And, yeah, as I said, the door is slightly ajar. You can see inside, obviously, the lights are on, because that's where the lights are coming from. Yeah, I doubt you've seen Mordhaupt's bedroom before, but it's as tastelessly furnished as everything else. It's got garish wallpaper, a big four-poster bed with colorful drapes hanging from it.
2800.20 2813.20 speaker3  To do coke off of.
2809.20 2832.20 speaker2  Well, he hasn't invented the anti-gravity coke mirror machine. No one has.
2826.20 2844.20 speaker1  you can see a pair of men's feet wearing socks,
2842.20 2866.20 speaker3  Party time's gotta go smooth, right? That's what's most important to religion, man. So let's carry on and talk to you now.
2865.20 2894.20 speaker1  Are you following her? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. in that there's a big sort of freestanding wardrobe up against one wall. And from somewhere apparently deep within it, you can hear what sounds like an electrical buzzing.
2891.20 2908.20 speaker3  Is Mordaunt okay, he says, as he's just staring into the light?
2902.20 3020.20 speaker1  He's wearing a silk dressing gown, garishly patterned. He looks pale. He's sweating profusely and his eyes, they've got deep rings under them and they seem quite sunken. His hair is matted with sweat and they're lying just a couple of feet away from him. You can see that there's a bottle that has got some kind of yellowish liquid in it. a glass hypodermic needle that's half full of the same liquid that's just lying on the ground. And you can see his trembling fingers, they're reaching out towards the syringe. Oh, yes, of course. you can see that there are track marks and weeping wounds, infected pus-filled wounds all down both of his arms. Gross. Cauterize it. And then there's a deep sigh. Oh, that's much better.
3018.20 3044.20 speaker3  Thank you so much for inviting me to your party. It's what?
3043.20 3169.20 speaker1  What is it, by the way? I should have been downstairs a long time ago. Oh, Margaret, Margaret! He pushes himself up, grabbing hold of the side of the bed, and says, Oh, Margaret, it's good to see you. I wish it were under better circumstances. From the open wardrobe, you can hear that buzzing sound again. It sounds like it might be electrical sparking. It might not be. There's something about that sound that you can hear that, yeah, that's not electrical. It sounds maybe like a beehive. Cicero's just shaking. You can see his eyes are looking a bit clearer, though, and he's standing up unsteadily. There's a big vein down his forehead that is just pulsing violently. Should have stuck him there. But he looks over at Mr. Ring.
3167.20 3180.20 speaker3  Including Mordaunt himself!
3179.20 3218.20 speaker1  Fuck you! I mean, this is just an unprotected human psyche for you to do with as you will.
3215.20 3245.20 speaker3  He's just trying to be a vessel to pass on. He's not even trying to do it himself, he's trying to open up himself to Margaret. He's gonna use Margaret as a conduit to get to the thing on the other side so that it can push through him into Mordaunt.
3238.20 3323.20 speaker1  But Margaret, the conscious part of your mind, you can hear that she actually sounds quite alarmed and frightened. I mean, you can hear her going, At the same time, you can hear Cicero's voice saying, Yes, yes, I understand. Yes, it is going to change the world. It's going to change. Yes, yes, it's going to change the world. I must do as you will. I must do. And from the distant place you are within your own psyche, you can suddenly feel something warm and wet. Splashing all over you. just wavering backwards and forwards. The top of his head is largely missing. And then he falls heavily down on the ground. And from the open wardrobe, you can just hear this buzzing voice, screaming angrily, Come closer dear in my teeth, thread her in my jaw.
