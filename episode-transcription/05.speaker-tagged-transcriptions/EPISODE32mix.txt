0.00 238.54 speaker0  Well, well, well, I see y'all are crawling back for more Wolf the Dog, and it don't matter if I'm broadcasting in contention, the city, or anywhere else in the galaxy, everybody always wants a taste of ol' Wolfy Boy. Well, I am here hittin' you live from 694.2 PTBP to let y'all feast upon my mouth sounds. I hope it's real satiatin' for y'all. This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Dr. Colossus, who is an honorary police officer on our Patreon and a member of the community over on the subreddit. They tagged atpretendingpod in a tweet, which is just about the sweetest thing to ol' Wolf. Dr. Colossus writes, Time for ol' Wolf to come clean, my pups. The audio adventures of the contention PD are just a cover to distract from my own insidious efforts to dominate the national radio landscape. Today contention, tomorrow the city, later on the world. I can tell you this now because it's too late to stop it. There's nowhere to hide as my hypnotic suggestions surf the electromagnetic waves straight into your ear holes and hack your brain stems. My dominion is nearly absolute. Remember, the trigger phrase is plate of foot meat. Thank you, Dr. Colossus, for ruining the surprise. My producer and I were going to start by buying out all the local radio stations in every small town so that Wolf the dog could have a grassroots movement of domination. Then I'd begin the persuasion. Real nice, real slow, you see. I got time. There's no one else for them to even listen to. Draw them all in with hunnied words and promises of infinite foot meat. Remember, if you want to write up something for your old wolf to how, tag at Pretending Pod on Instagram or Twitter, tag Pretending To Be People on Facebook, or write a five-star review and email us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com. Y'all, I need that positive motivation from you beautiful people because life in the city is strange. Yesterday, I saw two pigeons eating a rat. Whenever I went over to try and scare them away, they hissed at me like a rabid raccoon before skittering off. They just ran away real fast. Please remember, my dear listeners, we got ourselves a Patreon now. The link is in the show notes, and if you can't support us with your money, please write a review on iTunes, and if you already wrote a review, please steal your friends' phones and write a review on their iTunes, and if you don't have friends, go to the nearest Apple store and write a review on iTunes from every phone and tablet on display in the whole fuckin' place, and while you're there, grab that aux cord that's connected to the speaker system and warn everyone that shit is about to slap.
237.54 423.98 speaker1  Spank me. Flank me. That means you yourself admit it yourself that you love your mother-in-law. Are you ready? Yeah. John Lee Pettymore, you are standing outside a storage unit. A massive yellow symbol has been spray painted on the door. The symbol is a wonky question mark with two lines, one curved and one straight, jutting down from the question mark's dot. The storage unit door slides up, and inside is the thick brush of well-wooded land. In the distance, you see a small cabin. Looking down, your hands are covered in blue paint, and you are holding one of those small silver spheres. It feels warm in your hands. It has a nice weight to it. And then you see a sky of endless darkness. Far out in front of you, through this thick and terminable nothing, you see two children standing completely still, holding hands, and you hear the sounds of torment. the wretched noise overwhelms your senses. You open your eyes, and you're staring up at a ceiling, and you look to the left, you look to the right, and you see corpses. And it smells overwhelmingly like blood and viscera and death and shit, other bodily fluids spilled out. You see the body of John Lee Pettymore IV. Your body, but not your current body. And you see the body of Rich Nichols, the man that led you from room to room in this layer of Marvin Glass. What do you do? Well honestly, the body of Kevin, or as we'll call him, John Lee Pettymore. Okay. reflective, extremely reflective. Looking in, you see this man who is, he looks like a broken version of your daddy that you knew from when you were a child, a very young child, but he is much older. side and these crazy eyes, and you're just an older man, basically the same build, you still have a mustache, you know there's a lot of similarities.
419.54 437.78 speaker2  I want to look at my old body and see where I came out of. Oh yeah. Okay. What do I feel like?
433.74 452.26 speaker1  Do I feel like a person or like something wrapping itself around a host? Well you feel like you've always felt. Okay.
447.58 474.98 speaker2  I want to, I want to basically pretend to be Kevin as long as I can. Okay. Yeah.
467.98 527.62 speaker1  to adapt some of the rules from Pulp Cthulhu, fold them into this campaign and in doing so, we have given each of the PCs two talents from the Pulp Cthulhu rule book. Thomas, you chose quick healer and this game we roll one D four to get new hit points for each day and in your case you'll get one D four plus three every day. And then you also chose clairvoyance. Basically how we're going to do that is I'm going to trust you to not use this every second that we're playing the game. That's a mistake. Yeah, I think that's fair, but here's what I'm gonna allow you to do. You can spend 10 luck at any point in time to like dive into your internal self and have a vision. Also with your, uh, with your character for the stuff you hit a breaking point yesterday as well, I believe.
526.62 535.22 speaker2  As your breaking point? No, 20 is my breaking point and it's, it's very hard to see. Right.
532.02 592.72 speaker1  So that means you're actually extremely close to your 28. There's no way that's a 28. So you're extremely close to your third breaking point. Well, we will hit that when we get there. However, on your, uh, on your first breaking point, when we did that, we had the idea that you were going to have to put your life in danger to save others. Basically you were going to throw yourself in harm's way to, to save others. And if you didn't, then there would be a willpower disadvantage for you the next day that is going to be subsumed by this next breaking point situation, which is when you roll sanity, if you fail and the role would also fail on a power check, what's your power 60. So if you roll on a sanity check and you roll over 60, then you are going to split into
591.08 600.12 speaker2  Okay.
592.72 644.04 speaker1  And that is a, uh, a load of role-playing that I am heaping onto your very, uh, capable talents. All right. I believe in you. You walked into this room and it was filled with filing cabinets and my file was sitting out open. John Lee Pettymore IV's file was sitting out open on the table as was a file regarding some people that ended up being Kevin. Marvin wants to talk to us.
639.12 648.88 speaker2  And I want to real quick see if, um, I can find a file for Clark and Keith.
647.88 652.92 speaker1  35.
651.92 660.56 speaker2  50. All right.
654.92 665.84 speaker1  And actually, um, in your new body, we're going to up your hit points and willpower
664.84 668.80 speaker2  Okay.
667.80 669.80 speaker1  Yeah.
668.80 670.80 speaker2  All your takes after his dad.
669.80 756.08 speaker1  Yeah, exactly. So yeah, I passed the search rule. names that catch your eye. One says Clark Bishop and it is completely empty. Another says Keith Vigna and it too is completely empty. Both of these file folders are, they're like extremely crisp and new. Then like the third folder you find titled the contention PD, which is so worn, it is turned a noticeably different color, uh, opening it. You see a lot of recent news stories, file clippings, uh, newspaper clippings that are cut out and put into this folder and they all have to do with the police force and whether or not you guys weren't handling missing persons cases or you were firing weapons into the air in public or you were harassing citizens. There are plenty of news articles written about the contention PD that have come out in the past three or four days that have been grouped into this folder.
753.68 788.84 speaker2  the file back where he found it and follows Rosemary. some spy craft as Kevin. It's not out of character for me to ask you how you're doing, is it? Everything's going as planned. Yeah.
787.84 791.32 speaker1  What part of the plan are we at?
789.84 799.00 speaker2  Where are you on your part of the plan? I know where I am, but what have you, what have you accomplished?
793.88 856.32 speaker1  Well, I think that's why we're, uh, I think that's why we're going to see Marvin for us. He's probably going to send us to go collect the money now. So you guys make it to the top of the, uh, elevator ride and the door opens and there's a long hallway and at the end of the hallway, there is a 10 by 10 slab of black marble and four guards, two on either side of the enormous and strange door that slowly slides open as you approach. And the guards are in full brown jumpsuits and they each have a large scythe strapped to their backs. And the blade of each scythe is shaped like an enormous fish hook. A closer look reveals these men have unnatural matching faces. Their eyes are far apart, almost on either side of their face. Their noses do not jut out, but are rather two slits above their two wide thick lipped mouths. And they have a few flaps on either side of their necks. Fish man. Walking into this.
855.32 863.88 speaker2  This whole time.
859.32 973.80 speaker1  When you walk into this room, you see it's the size of a basketball court to your left. One of the long walls is entirely made of glass. And there is murky greenish water on the other side, like an aquarium, but it's of staggering proportions. Marvin Glass is standing behind a table, arms folded behind his back, staring off into the distance. And again, he is just massive and gaunt all at the same time. And he is still wearing that fitted black tuxedo that you've seen him before. And when you turn, you see his weird hole in his face where his mouth should be is still just covered in this circle of red lipstick. And that hole begins moving. You have been doing excellent work for me recently. And we are moving into the final phase of contentions demolition. And as he's saying this, you notice that behind them, there are these windows and you see lights, just like crazy lights, just like shining in and off. It looks like there's something happening in that room behind him, but you can't quite tell what it is. Looking around the room, you see that on Marvin's desk, there is one of those small silver spheres sitting on like a little tripod holder that's holding it up.
968.52 1007.80 speaker2  That's awesome because I knew he had one from the tape and now I don't have to go looking for it. It's right there. You can see it.
1002.96 1057.88 speaker1  I just have one request on your way to contention. I believe it begins rather shortly and he will be out in the world for the first time in a very long time. I have sent your new Charles, Keith Vigna, one of the officers from the contention police his job.
1056.32 1067.32 speaker2  Not again. Kevin thinks it's very appropriate that Vigna is the new Charles considering he killed the first one.
1066.32 1128.52 speaker1  That's so good. the plans, huh, sir? And Marvin laughs.
1123.44 1150.64 speaker2  My attempt to shame Rosemary in front of Marvin has failed miserably.
1143.56 1163.68 speaker1  way and you guys take the elevator back up to the top after loading up with some heavy
1160.68 1170.56 speaker2  Why did you get the gun instead of the money?
1169.56 1197.94 speaker1  stop. Like, I thought for sure that they were going to keep going until they just blew my brains onto the concrete. And I don't trust them to have not stopped the second time. And so I obviously not wanting to get shot, I hate getting shot. You know, I hate getting shot. So I, you know, just figured that was the easiest way.
1195.06 1221.58 speaker2  pleased that she was like actually intimate. Like we were something of a force to be reckoned with at least. Right. Yeah. Some sort of fry.
1214.46 1262.60 speaker1  in an alleyway in the city and the sun is shining in kind of bright from the, from a low angle and there's fog in this alleyway and you look over and you see a group of raucous, like rowdy people, like people that you wouldn't expect at 10 AM, but maybe in the city that's more normal. There's at least 12 of them and they all walk up to this, uh, this alleyway that you're in and there's a large grate on the ground and they all stand on it and they all hold up their dirty dog key fobs at the same time and the grate seems to disappear and they
1261.60 1280.64 speaker2  Yeah. Okay. And that's sitting in lockup, evidence lockup most likely. Cool.
1275.20 1368.20 speaker1  you hop in and begin making your way to the city cemetery. the elevator that you came in on and you ride up to the top and it leads you back to the parking garage that you drove into when you came with your partners and Doug Jacobs and the body of agent Trent Chad and Rosemary. And when you arrive up there, there are still the same guards up there wearing suits and earpieces and your police cruiser from contention is also sitting exactly where it was before. Do I see any of my friends? No, you do not. this whole time. your cruiser and when you look at your cell phone, you see that you have a bunch of missed calls and a voicemail from Drew Andrews.
1364.80 1376.12 speaker2  Okay, I listen to the voicemail.
1375.12 1406.68 speaker1  you guys. Oh, fuck everybody. It's everywhere now. You have to tell everyone, everyone, please, please, you have to get as far away. You have to get as far away as possible from here. It's growing. It's growing. Fuck.
1405.68 1418.58 speaker2  save Drew. Okay. Oh, do I have the camera with me?
1416.30 1422.54 speaker1  of the items that you came here with. Okay.
1421.42 1425.10 speaker2  The gun's gone. The gun is gone for sure.
1424.10 1443.06 speaker1  Yeah. Okay. The camera's gone. The body armor's all gone. Okay. Yeah. You're just left with a couple of guns.
1438.66 1448.26 speaker2  And then Marvin actually gave you your small, powerful gun. When is this funeral?
1446.54 1457.10 speaker1  You've just enough time to like make it there. Okay.
1454.22 1465.50 speaker2  I have just enough time, I guess I can't go get my dress clothes on. So I'm going to be dressed for a different occasion, but. Maybe stand out like a sore thumb.
1464.50 1510.70 speaker1  We'll see. So you, uh, you drive to the city cemetery and I don't know if Keith has been here before, but the city cemetery is all. Oh, it is in the city. It is in the city. Yeah. And it's all above ground. Exactly. So there are, as you drive up, you park and then there are countless tombs winding aimlessly about creating all these odd little pathways. The mausoleums are just tall enough to look down on you as you pass through. And the morning fog adds an extra layer of disorientation.
1506.90 1526.70 speaker2  it smells like a crawfish boil. And I head to where the smell is coming from.
1520.38 1550.42 speaker1  a funeral service set up for Ari Manstein surrounded by these ornate and menacing graves. There are a handful of rows of chairs, all facing a small podium next to a coffin. Where would you like to... Yeah, the circles are seats.
1549.42 1558.18 speaker2  Okay. Where's the crawfish boil pot at? It is...
1556.54 1563.86 speaker1  It's actually right in front of the coffin. You want to be first in line. I want to be first in line.
1562.86 1571.42 speaker2  Absolutely.
1570.42 1597.06 speaker1  greet you. I thought maybe there was a chance that you weren't going to come, but you know, last minute and then I don't know where your partners are, but this is just, I couldn't be any happier or sadder technically, I guess I am at my daughter's funeral, but thank you.
1593.06 1605.26 speaker2  They're a bit incapacitated right now though, but I wouldn't miss it for the world.
1603.82 1617.62 speaker1  seat in the front row. Okay.
1613.62 1622.34 speaker2  All right, yeah, I'm good.
1619.62 1631.38 speaker1  That's what literally everyone has agreed on. We all came together, put our thumb on the thing, showed that we pledged our allegiance to you. I appreciate it.
1630.38 1653.42 speaker2  Thank you everyone.
1643.82 1666.30 speaker1  and you are looking at chief Maggie cook or Maggie cook now, and she backs away from you pretty quickly. As soon as the weird squamous, like worm like creature with the mouths is back in the ground, she steps back and she looks at you and she's, Oh, okay.
1665.30 1680.74 speaker2  Um, all right.
1673.02 1687.06 speaker1  When you came back, I know we went over this, but how, how was it that you are still alive?
1686.06 1691.62 speaker0  Okay.
1690.58 1740.78 speaker1  need to get going. So basically as soon as you're finished up, you can do pretty much whatever. You can head back to contention. You can hang out in the city. We'll put you up here if you'd rather stick around and be close, but this job isn't a daily situation or it won't be at first. We'll get you trained up and, uh, working more and more often, but for now you can pretty much go back to contention, get your affairs in order and, uh, pack up everything because your life there, it doesn't, doesn't have to stay there. You can, you can move here. You can, you can move wherever you need to be and, uh, and we'll, we'll stay in contact with you either way.
1739.78 1745.78 speaker0  thing. Let's, let's stop it. Let's make it not be. All right.
1744.78 1763.34 speaker1  I like your passion. I like your fire. This is exactly what we need in this organization right now is fire. All right. So take this and she pulls a burner phone out of her pocket and she hands it to you. Take this and I'll be in contact with you.
1760.42 1775.38 speaker2  I'll, I'll, I'll hit you up tomorrow and I'll make sure that we get going. All right. Hey, hey Maggie, do you know anything about my partners?
1772.02 1860.94 speaker1  They dropped off the radar about when you did. Do you think they're ready? Yeah, but are they ready? Let me know. All right, Clark, you being a part of this, that means I trust you. We're going to rely on each other a whole lot moving forward. So if you say they're ready, then I believe you. So in order for that not to happen, let's get you moving. All right. And so she leads you back up top, back into the parking lot of the mill and sets you up with a car. It's a little silver Honda Accord and she hands you the keys.
1859.94 1866.06 speaker2  Of course.
1862.94 1873.22 speaker0  All a news, a gun. You guys have all those old contention police department uniforms in there. I went ahead and got my old uni, an old uniform of mine.
1872.22 1880.06 speaker1  Amazing.
1875.14 1891.90 speaker0  And uh, Oh, you got any of those, uh, Leon gave me this gun that shot these tranquilizer darts that made people do things. You got any of those left?
1887.38 1943.38 speaker1  We just used the last of it to make sure we could get the federal Bureau of investigation on our side. We thought that might be quite important. Okay. Yeah. He needs to die. Cool. So, uh, you hop in the car and you're heading off to the city cemetery and the car is actually low on gas. So you have to stop and fill it up on the way over there. And while you're filling it up, I need you to roll an alertness check for me.
1941.18 1958.74 speaker0  Ooh boy. I pass a 32 on a 70.
1952.34 1968.86 speaker1  turn around just in time to see that something has been dropped into the passenger seat of
1966.86 1974.42 speaker2  Can I get any sense of who she is? Any chance I've seen her before?
1971.26 2020.30 speaker1  It is an average build woman with dark hair. You walk around the car, open the door, pick up the cell phone and the cell phone immediately buzzes with a text message. And it says, do you want to know why your parents were killed?
2019.18 2038.36 speaker0  the menus on this phone. Do I see anything else? Old text messages, a sign of a phone number anywhere, contacts. I just reply, who is this?
2033.06 2209.68 speaker1  And then you hop back in the car and head back on your way to the city cemetery. And when you arrive, uh, I don't know if Clark has been to the city cemetery before, but it is all above ground mausoleums and such. Exactly. So you pull up to a parking lot and then you walk in to the city cemetery underneath this big gate that like old like iron rot that kind of spells city cemetery in the gate and you walk through and you're now in these windy, endless seeming walkways that you're surrounded by these tall tombs and mausoleums on either side that are looking down on you and it's morning and there's fog all through. Cool. Yeah. It smells almost like a, like a new Orleans party in the cemetery and you follow your And as you approach, you can see that there in the distance, uh, there's a small clearing and inside the clearing there's a funeral service set up for Ari Manstein, a handful of rows of chairs and they're all facing a podium next to a coffin. And you can probably see from where you're at, you're far enough away to where no one's really paying attention to you so far, but looking in and you see Jan Manstein, the mother of Ari and you see Keith Vigna and he is wearing Sperry's boat shoes. I believe a blue coral shorts that are very small or big. I can't quite remember. And then I think they're too big. That would make sense. And then a, uh, like an orange polo that is extremely tight. I don't know necessarily. You don't know why he's wearing that, but that is what he's wearing. in the cage when you watched him die. So this might be a confusing sight for old Clark Bishop. back from the other side. So basically this is the setup. I'm holding up a whiteboard with the setup and Keith is on the front row in front of the coffin. Uh, in front of the coffin, there is a crawfish crawdad boil going on, which is causing the
2204.92 2230.04 speaker2  scent to be overwhelming in this area. It's as weird to you as it is to me. Okay.
2226.36 2245.10 speaker1  It was in your, uh, it was in your package that you were supposed to read before you
2244.10 2270.26 speaker0  There is a crowd. Okay. You know, in a movie when the guy goes to the funeral that doesn't want to be seen at the funeral and he's kind of amongst the trees, but he's not, he's not hiding per se. Sure. That's what I'm doing.
2264.62 2282.78 speaker1  So are you in the back in open sight of everyone or are you going to kind of creep behind some, some like one of the tombs that's nearby? You could probably like hide behind a column or just like stand up against the column.
2281.68 2291.20 speaker0  that guy hiding?
2290.20 2294.00 speaker1  Yeah. Nothing respects the dead like leaning on them.
2293.00 2297.00 speaker2  Of course.
2296.00 2316.52 speaker0  Is my other partner there?
2313.80 2330.24 speaker2  Oh, they thought of me.
2326.00 2423.80 speaker1  way to the city cemetery in the car with Rosemary. dead until Marvin said that we'd replaced him. And then I just looked it up on my phone and I saw that he, he died in contention. know. I didn't know that they were serious. I thought they might've been lying to try to get me to talk or something. So I just thought that, you know, we were a little bit more robust than that. Is that where are you? easily. I would imagine you're not going to keep him around if he's just a dog on a leash basically. So he, I think he's far more far more eloquent than even say Rosemary, you know, cause she's, she's when you're, when you're right next to her, you see that she's got some scars on her as well and she's able to keep up. Got cool.
2422.80 2426.80 speaker2  Gotcha. All right.
2425.80 2445.36 speaker1  Hold on.
2443.60 2452.52 speaker2  Everything dies.
2451.52 2551.50 speaker1  Like New Orleans. Exactly. So you pull into a parking lot and the two of you begin walking through all these different mausoleums and these little pathways that are winding endlessly to and fro about. And it's morning and the sun's coming in at a low angle on this fog that is perpetuating all throughout this entire cemetery. As you're walking through you, you smell this like nice seafood, like crawfish, like scent, like New Orleans. It smells like New Orleans. And following the scent, the two of you see from a distance, you hear a large group of people and you see that there's a small clearing ahead where there's a funeral service set up for Ari Manstein. And it is surrounded by all these ornate and these, these menacing, these tall graves, these tombs that are completely encasing this, this little clearing. But inside there are a handful of rows of chairs that are all facing a small podium next to a coffin. And in front of the coffin is the crawfish boil. You see that there is a Keith Vigna sitting on the front row. How does Keith look? that he has regained an eyeball and his jaw, that he has regained his eyeball and his jaw. And so that is different. And he's also wearing a very tight fitting orange polo, like bright orange polo and these massive coral shorts. What's Keith's bod like?
2549.54 2614.50 speaker2  He's still wearing those big pants. What's he like under that tight, tight polo? Stringy, I think. Yeah. Beanie. In a polo. Wait, on top of other horses? whack a ball. Anthropologists look at horse cultures and see if they've come up with polo to determine how advanced they are. Horsey culture.
2613.50 2616.50 speaker1  Horsey culture. Did you see that Brony documentary?
2615.50 2617.50 speaker2  Thankfully, no.
2616.50 2678.52 speaker1  Don't you mean they? I'm sorry. He's sitting in the very front row in front of the coffin. And as you continue to look around, go ahead and roll a search for me. 84, fail. one of the mausoleums is Clark Bishop. He is wearing an old contention police uniform, like an older model of the contention police department uniform. And he is just leaning casually in the very back.
2675.44 2708.20 speaker2  I'm going to circle the perimeter and check things out. And I want to make my way towards the so-called Clark Bishop in this old uniform. Does he look natural? Is his stance Clark's stance? It looks like Clark. Do I still have? Shot by his daddy.
2703.24 2725.48 speaker1  Rosemary is like, I think I'm going to get some higher ground over here. She is going to climb on top of one of the mausoleums. That looks real dumb.
2724.48 2767.00 speaker2  Nailed it. Convincing. and see if he looks. Okay. Yeah. 81. My skill is 50. Okay. Yeah. We don't even need a mirror. I want to get behind just some people near him and kind of like play in the penis game Yeah. That's great. Does he look? Yeah. All right.
