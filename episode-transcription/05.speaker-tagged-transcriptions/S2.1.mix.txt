0.00 28.38 speaker0  Thanks. Thanks for that fridge. It was like the grudge sound. Sounds like clinking bones.
22.76 40.74 speaker1  that went back in the fridge. There was a mouse in the fridge? No man, it was the ghost
35.34 138.98 speaker0  Zach. Welcome to season two of Pretending to be People. First off, Joe, do you need to listen to season one of Pretending to be People? Hell no. But should you listen to season one of Pretending to be People, Luke? Hell yeah. And what did you think about season one of Pretending to be People, Thomas? I thought we could do better. That's why we're In and out, 20 minute campaign. Justin is also back with us as both Wolf the dog, the AM radio DJ, who will continue to introduce each episode. And he's also returning as our in-house composer. Justin actually messaged me and said, hey Zach. That's how he messages Justin back in-house composing for season two. Very excited. I hope it's good. Oh, I listened to it. We'll see. Now we are here because what do we do? We play a role playing whatever you have, but we have a table. I thought you meant like best friends or whoever
134.86 148.06 speaker1  and pretend to be people. And we tell stories together. He said the name. He said the name.
143.38 307.70 speaker0  a game called Delta Green, the role playing game and a game called Pulp Cthulhu. This season we are maybe going to utilize a lot of those same rules, but we're really focusing Cthulhu. I should mention here Delta Green is published by Arc Dream Publishing. Shout out to them for creating an absolutely phenomenal game that we can't remember all the rules What does that mean? Oh, that just means that when your characters choose to go off on their not just for fuck words. Uh, we're going to get pretty gross. We're going to get pretty how long we've been playing together? 18, 19 years. It hasn't been quite that long.
303.62 316.86 speaker1  I'd divide that by three and I think we'd be about right. So how long did we play before
311.30 486.10 speaker0  I think before we started playing. And then season one was almost four years of recording. this group because you're literally my, I was going to say best friends. You're my only friends. But I also- Is that better or worse? It's the same dude. It sounded like a downgrade in the town cops last season. This season, we're not doing that. And we're also not playing Delta
479.70 681.22 speaker1  it's a new Howlin' with Wolf. This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from John Scott Tynes, Call of Cthulhu, Puppetland, and Delta Green. John tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod, a very cool and very easy thing to do. He writes, I've got a message here from high up on the down low. Hey, clockwork child, love your style. Watch out for minotaurs in the labyrinth. Dr. Gonzo, keep on keeping it surreal. Jeff Hawthorne, hello and goodbye. Nice job keeping ahead. And Florida man, master of the dude way. Rock that red beard and tell Jane hi. Blood and Wolf to howl, just tag at Pretending Pod on Twitter or Instagram. Tag pretending to be people on podcasts, screenshot that super supportive endorsement and send it to our socials. And if your body in the finest of branded threads, go grab a shirt, hat, beach towel and fanny pack over at PretendingPod.shop. No need to remember all that. The links are in the show notes and me, I need to go folks. Find some wet debris and with a whole dose. We've got a brand new theme to warm up your throats. It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.
670.86 772.30 speaker0  It's June 18th, 2022 and walking feels more like wading through a pool. But plenty of people are parading up and down the perpendicular pathways that make up the city. Each intersection, four perfectly 90 degree angles. Each street sign, splendidly shining in the sunlight. Each person some folks keep their heads on straight, helps them keep a grip on their reality, but everyone's different. Though I bet plenty of people would agree it'd be nice to be able to get an eyeful of the city without being inundated with so many advertisements. Facebook, Olive Garden, The Godel Company, Gucci, Amazon, The City News, Apple, Exxon Mobil. It's impossible. They're everywhere. You say The Gobble Company? G-O-T-T-L-E. It's like Butterball. The Godel to feed the cows? That's just agriculture. Yeah, they're an agriculture, they're an ag company.
768.62 800.06 speaker1  Hell yeah. Who's going to be the bad guy, do you guys think?
795.74 905.18 speaker0  out in the field of City Action News. I want you to tell me about your character and what they're up to on this oppressively moist Saturday afternoon. My character is Julius Tyfe Ralen, T-Y-F-E, Ralen. Shout out to Jeff from Seattle. One of our patrons at the $10 above level has given us this character who is a six foot tall man with dark slicked back hair and a permanent smirk. Tyfe is a cool name. Tyfe Ralen is the executive producer of the City Action News and he is Julius Summers direct report. Hey, what the fuck is up? My beautiful baby nephew. Come on. Huh? It's a beautiful day for overtime. Yeah. Stucks.
904.62 913.10 speaker1  Overtime.
908.06 957.42 speaker0  Of course you are. All right. Well, get him, get the camera guy, get them all out to the, get him out to a farm. Okay. Find a magnetic fucking farmer to do 90 seconds. Only 90 seconds. Okay. On whether they would sell their land to the Godel company. I heard Fred Godel himself is going around and closing these land deals in person. See what they think about that, right? Okay. Just 90 seconds this time. Don't let him go all in depth like he likes to. Oh, and nephew.
956.70 1036.86 speaker1  It's going to be hard. masters, which is weird. He big thighs, normal rest of his body. He throws on. So normal dong, but thick thighs. People are like, whoa, get it, get a load of those. Do they save lives? his eyes and starts pointing around and then stops and he puts on a light tan suit with a tan
1028.70 1048.14 speaker0  undershirt, a tan tie, tan pants and tan shoes. So everyone can see your sweat stains on this
1042.46 1087.74 speaker1  but it'll soak up as much sweat as possible. Grabs a cell phone, puts it in his pocket, Summers house, which is located right on the outskirts of town and the first like little
1078.14 1109.50 speaker0  let's dive in and see what Thomas's character is. As a character. When you get this phone call, what are you up to? It's a hot Saturday in the city. Cal Colorado has definitely been
1104.78 1159.02 speaker1  and he sets down his, his cup of black coffee and he picks up the receiver and he says, going to the farm. Which farm? You can figure that out while I drive to come get you. kind of get to know you thing. As soon as the phone is hung up, he's like, fuck that.
1153.98 1189.98 speaker0  Honestly, the AC hasn't even kicked in to full gear at this point in time. Windows are kind of rolled down while you've got the air flying through. Oh, I thought you meant the AC in Cal
1185.42 1332.14 speaker1  But Cal Colorado keeps it at 73 no matter what time of year. accessories. There are a bunch of pictures along the entrance hall, like showing a long career. I'm not sure how the last guy did it, but I'm sure I'll do just as well. Well, He just kind of nods and then he calls his camera man and heads to the camera guy's house.
1329.58 1455.82 speaker2  I guess you could try again cause I'm not calling you back. he is just in his tighty whities, pasty skin, uh, blonde hair, kind of medium length, all messy from a fitful night of sleep. There are pizza boxes and energy drinks all over the floor. And on a desk that has a bunch of computer monitors. When we say bed, he's on top of the sheets. Like he obviously just conked forward from a standing position pounding on the door in his dream and he's been scared to answer it. And then he, oh, uh, uh, oh shit. And he starts jumping up and he goes to his closet, he rips it open and there are a variety of Hawaiian shirts are on the rack. But his favorite one is on the floor crumpled He throws it on, uh, he goes and opens the door and he still just got the tighty whities.
1451.10 1515.66 speaker1  Julius just kind of looks him up and down. The Caesar reference goes right over his head.
1510.54 1640.78 speaker2  on a cargo shorts that have a lot of pockets. These are, these are the cargoiest of cargo first he grabs the leftover energy drink that's sitting on his desk and he takes a big swig of it and realizes that it was from like five days ago and that wasn't the one he was drinking last Amongst this chaos though, you do see that like the computer desk that's strewn with energy drinks and stuff, it's got the computer monitors and stuff. The actual computer monitors and desk and stuff are impressive. It's a good high quality setup and kind of over in a corner is where he keeps his camera equipment and it's the cleanest part of the house and he grabs two cases. One's got the camera and one's got all of his accoutrement and he grabs a tripod and gets it up under his arm and it's all a little disheveled as he's walking toward you. Alright
1635.66 1697.26 speaker1  could you open the glove box? Cal is, like, kind of looking over his script and not really paying glove box and he has some, like, cool, like, flame striped racing gloves in there and he puts those
1692.22 1765.34 speaker0  off the highway right outside of town. You're gonna hit a country road and then head off on a two-lane farm road that, uh, shockingly has farms on either side of it. As you head down, you see that the O'Carney Farm has a bunch of trucks and cars parked on the grass up by the house, uh, and then to the left you see a, uh, a very quiet farm. Far, far less. Is it a bio-farm? Are you gonna hit me with that every time I do this? out there. No one's out and about currently. And then on the right you see a farm, which is, yeah, the O'Carney one, but it has a bunch of cars and trucks pulled up by the house.
1761.50 1799.34 speaker2  out the window. Awesome. I don't know if I should say it every time, but he, that's one of his things is he's always filming. So think of that when you think of Beck. Think of that when you
1792.94 1922.38 speaker0  of 30, maybe even 40 cars and trucks all haphazardly parked, but nice enough to where no one is blocking anyone else in. As you guys approach, you see that there is a folding table to the right of the farmhouse. And there is a man who is dressed to the farmer nines standing behind it with a metal box in front of him with the lid wide open. He is very much a farmer, what with overalls and a big straw hat, but you also see that he is wearing a full face mask, Come on down. It's going to be a $5 entrance for each of you to see some Farm Wrestling. I'm the tiller, which is funny for two reasons. One, I till the ground and till my opponent into the
1916.06 1954.54 speaker1  at Beck and Cal. Guys, I heard about this in college. I didn't think it was real. Farm Wrestling. he's just saying, a big black bug bit a big black bear. A big black bug bit a big black bear. Wow,
1950.06 1969.98 speaker0  of course. And he pulls out his cell phone and attaches a little square on the bottom of it,
1966.94 2022.70 speaker1  Oh, it was a business card. No, I meant the credit card.
2019.74 2054.22 speaker0  t-shirt with the sleeves cut off. Nice. She seems to be in her mid-50s, maybe up to 60s. You're not quite sure. a backyard wrestling arena. Thank you, Curtis.
2050.46 2098.46 speaker2  Beck is going to already start setting up a tripod to see if he can get a good angle of her just standing here. We don't even need to go anywhere in his eyes.
2092.62 2103.74 speaker0  And she takes a massive swig from the bottle of Jim Beam that she had in her hand.
2102.46 2110.94 speaker2  We don't even need to communicate. Kal is combing his hair as you do that.
2106.94 2145.18 speaker1  Julius is like, thanks, ma'am, and grabs the bottle out of her hand and just kind of walks inside of the camera. She accepts. Hey guys, fuck it. Let's cut it again.
2143.58 2148.46 speaker0  We're doing a lot of pissing.
2145.18 2156.38 speaker1  That's what we're good for here. An old P-T-B-P. Stands for pissing.
2155.82 2191.10 speaker0  Pissing. Pissing. Farm wrestling.
2186.94 2213.26 speaker1  But now, thanks to changing times, she's forced to do the unthinkable. She hosts violent combats on her property just to make ends meet. Muriel, when did these farm wrestling matches begin?
2207.02 2239.98 speaker0  My son, Mitch, is a big fan of wrestling and he loves his wrestling mask. He actually, he loves his wrestling mask so much at a young age, he started having sex with it. And then eventually, the mask actually became pregnant and had a baby. I didn't even know he was fucking his mask, but now it's apparent.
2237.90 2247.42 speaker1  we gotta cut all this, we gotta cut all this.
2245.82 2256.78 speaker2  It's pointed at the ground right now.
2252.54 2261.98 speaker0  You can tell that she is intoxicated, even though she's very good at holding her liquor.
2258.54 2304.38 speaker1  Muriel, maybe we steer more towards the Godel company. Yeah, okay. It's quickly replaced by a professional smile. a major player in agribusiness. You are one of the last holdouts in the area. What keeps you here?
2303.42 2315.98 speaker0  Come on back here. And she kind of motions the camera and you as well toward the back of the farmhouse.
2313.58 2332.30 speaker2  Cal Colorado is going to stay in the frame no matter what he does.
2325.50 2359.26 speaker0  strewn over the back door as a makeshift tunnel for wrestlers to make their entrances. And there is a farm DIY wrestling ring set up right near this tarped tunnel in which there is a wrestler dressed as a crab, also wearing a luchador mask with the sign of, I don't know, the cancer sign for... Which one's the 69? That's the one. He's got a big old 69 on his face, I guess. Gemini, right? Oh, wait, what?
2358.22 2364.54 speaker1  I thought that was the crab.
2362.22 2369.42 speaker0  I don't know what any of it is.
2368.62 2376.38 speaker2  Yeah, cut me out.
2371.10 2424.86 speaker0  So on the mask, the 69 is around the two eyes, but besides that, fully dressed as a crab, even including claws on his hands. The other wrestler is extremely patriotic, just stars and stripes all the way through. And she leads you back there and she yells out to this crowd of 50 to 80 people. They all start chanting.
2421.42 2439.02 speaker2  And then toward the end of the panning shot, he's getting really up close to one of the more vehement, sweaty, spittle, coming out of the mouth shots of a person who's just red-faced and angry yelling this. Oh, yeah.
2432.38 2455.66 speaker0  And she's got pigtails on the top of her head on either side, and she's just screaming into the camera, Fuck Fred Godel! So I would say that's what I think about the Godel company.
2453.74 2463.26 speaker2  his neck at the least, but they're on his ears at this point. So he whips back around to get her in frame with Cal.
2461.66 2469.98 speaker0  I'm not paid to think, ma'am. Oh shit, 90 seconds.
2468.62 2481.26 speaker1  Wrap it up, wrap it up. Did you pay? Yes.
2478.70 2493.10 speaker0  Well, you're free to stick around if you want to. And she walks back to the wrestling ring.
2492.38 2509.66 speaker1  folk culture. What we're going to be doing.
2506.86 2522.38 speaker0  If I'm being honest, I had no idea this was going to happen. Oh, you didn't know we were going to farm wrestling?
2521.34 2528.46 speaker1  Doesn't mean I planned it. Anything for it.
2527.50 2538.22 speaker2  don't want to be interviewed.
2532.70 2583.42 speaker1  He, he motions to Beck to like put the camera down and he, he approaches like Muriel without the microphone. Ma'am, you have an opportunity to get your side of the story out today. Now, so far with the profanity and well, frankly, a lot of those men are covered in blood. We can't show that on our family network. Do you want to give us something we can use? He has an 80 persuade, but he doesn't quite make it.
2577.58 2639.58 speaker0  I have given you each a one point of luck to start this campaign with. And when I say point, I mean that you have luck. We are doing luck in a slightly different way than we've played in the past. So it might take us a little bit to remember it all, but you either have luck in this game luck, you can switch your tens dice and your what's the other one called? Hundreds. No, single single. Singles. Your ones dice. You can switch the tens and the singles dice in order to perhaps create a success. Please ask me for luck if I don't give it to you.
2638.30 2648.30 speaker2  You told us about the kissing thing.
2647.58 2653.10 speaker0  It had to be good.
2652.54 2677.34 speaker1  Tonguey. He said sweet like cherry pie, I think.
2675.82 2690.94 speaker2  A wasted sweet little kiss.
2682.70 2708.70 speaker1  As Cal sees his words fall flat, he just gives her a huge wink with his piercing blue eyes. And she looks up at you. Again.
2706.54 2728.94 speaker0  I miss you being the anchor, Cam. I do too, Mrs. O'Carney. All right, well, let's go over here with a nice shot of the farm in the background and say something nice for the people, huh? I would surely appreciate that.
2726.06 2738.94 speaker2  She set herself up in a good spot with rolling fields behind her. The edge of the farmhouse is there to get a sense of perspective. She set up a nice shot and I follow her lead.
2737.66 2754.86 speaker1  Crabs are walking by. Right. That's why the wrestlers were corn and crab guys.
2753.50 2763.42 speaker0  All right, let's do this. Mariel O'Carney.
2759.26 2777.66 speaker1  The Godel company has been purchasing many of your neighbor's properties. You are the last holdout in the area. What keeps you here?
2769.58 2865.50 speaker0  I don't appreciate someone who has been given everything that they have coming in and trying to use that privilege to buy up what is rightfully mine and has been, like you said, in my family for four generations. I am not going to sell to Fred Godel because I do not trust him. I think he is a snake of a businessman but he's no longer mentally capable to run the Godel company, which is why his idiot son has taken over. Sorry, I'll do that again. I don't want to sell my land to the Godel company because they are ruining America. As she stares straight down the camera. In my opinion, they are taking the ability to make a living for oneself out of the hands of those of us who have been doing the living for ourselves for generations and feeding America. Are you comfortable, Cal, with one person being in charge of feeding America?
2863.82 2868.62 speaker1  No, Cal was never going to answer that.
2867.42 2874.14 speaker0  Are you not here for the truth?
2871.18 2893.10 speaker1  but I'm not the one who answers the questions. I ask the questions and the people seem to think I do a pretty good job. Can I ask you a question?
2891.66 2902.46 speaker2  Does she fault them for it? And maybe even why she thinks that they sold, that kind of thing.
2901.82 2914.86 speaker1  Good question.
2913.74 2942.54 speaker0  It's none of my business. They can do with their land what they want to do. I'm going to do it my land, what I want to do. Yeah. And she points over at one of the guys watching the match. He's just dressed in like super normal clothes. He's car hearted out. That's a typhus. Typhoid barge.
2940.62 2947.66 speaker1  We're playing Star Wars, right? Exactly.
2946.54 2950.62 speaker0  Typhoid barge.
2948.78 2951.18 speaker3  Such a good Star Wars name.
2950.62 2959.74 speaker0  That's great. That's the lupus mcmanus.
2958.94 2966.22 speaker1  It's never lupus.
2962.46 2969.52 speaker0  He sold the lemon farm like a week ago.
2969.02 2982.06 speaker1  No.
2980.06 2989.50 speaker0  Pulling it out, pulling it outward. Oh yeah, that's not kneading.
2985.74 3010.62 speaker1  but he goes over and is going to go talk to Mr. Lemon.
3009.34 3025.10 speaker2  Did you hear that tiller guy?
3022.22 3033.34 speaker0  you hear him talking in his normal voice to someone.
3031.82 3047.74 speaker1  but I also control the till.
3046.86 3049.50 speaker3  Yee-haw.
3049.18 3063.10 speaker0  Sorry.
3062.54 3064.86 speaker2  Objection.
3064.30 3077.98 speaker3  Leading the win.
3077.34 3083.02 speaker0  Open up. Did you guys ever do that? Was it make the chills happen on the back of somebody?
3082.14 3119.02 speaker1  Carry on Luke. I didn't know if that was like your alphabet trick for eating pussy. So he walks up to Lemon and what are these guys' names?
3118.06 3123.66 speaker0  And cousin Sam.
3121.02 3125.74 speaker3  We got cap and crustacean versus cousin Sam.
3124.22 3139.26 speaker1  Sir, what do you like to be on TV? I hear that you recently came in to a lot of money.
3137.90 3154.30 speaker3  What do I need to tell you about?
3150.70 3157.90 speaker0  He spits in his left hand and shakes you with his right hand like a normal person.
3155.82 3180.86 speaker1  Cal gamely spits in his left hand and shakes. Oh, yeah.
3179.02 3197.50 speaker0  He's already looking at the camera and he's like,
3194.54 3205.10 speaker2  if you'll address your questions to Cal there, he's the one that's going to be talking to you. You don't have to look down the barrel.
3204.14 3220.86 speaker1  Headphones on.
3217.10 3257.82 speaker0  his entire body, his face goes pale and he starts sweating as he's just staring at the headphones that are on the ears of Beck Wilder. It's like a physical reaction.
3254.94 3285.90 speaker2  and then does hands up like they're done.
3283.90 3291.66 speaker0  Yeah, Cal reaches out to steady him.
3288.94 3293.98 speaker3  It's Saturday afternoon straw.
3293.42 3300.46 speaker1  Yeah, of course.
3299.98 3323.98 speaker0  70. Fantastic. And so as you pass, you see that there is a pure unconscious terror in this man directed toward headphones for some reason that he is not seemingly aware of.
3322.62 3409.90 speaker3  Thank you so much for having me. or a Fred Godel around very often. Now, do you? When it came to my property and made me do, I couldn't quite refuse you. Not good at that. Not going to tell you how exactly much, but enough to where I was ready to sell pretty much merely. Well over what it is worth, in my opinion. When it comes to money, I will tell you. My farm is roughly estimated to be worth about 1.2 million dollars. Indeed, it's enough for me to live off of for the rest of my life. My money stays right with me.
3408.62 3433.66 speaker1  2.5 million? And it's way more than he currently owns, which is still a lot. Right, he has deleted his crypto app off of his phone so that he doesn't look at it. Oh, is that a little...
3429.82 3438.94 speaker3  I diversify my portfolio across my pockets.
3437.26 3454.70 speaker1  Do we have anything else we want to ask this guy? Are you still on it or have you moved?
3453.58 3478.86 speaker3  You see, I'm right over there. So I'm just selling off all my equipment.
3478.62 3482.70 speaker1  No.
3482.38 3491.34 speaker0  Damn.
3490.46 3492.86 speaker1  Some of them make it.
3491.90 3515.90 speaker0  Some of them frogger.
3511.02 3519.42 speaker1  Cal is stoked that he said that and just says, Mr. Lemon, enjoy the wrestling. Cal, Colorado reporting from Okarni Farm. Just a taste.
