177.92 291.28 speaker2  um anything i want to look at her communication see who she's talking to you know is she in a
288.48 387.92 speaker1  basically what you would garner is that she was a pretty standoffish kid from what you can tell she clearly grew up maybe not clearly but she grew up in this house with her grandma her parents are gone she's had a weird home life uh her grandma raised her but was always stoned you would gather from her phone that she probably has uh
382.64 460.88 speaker2  before we forget okay so it seems like a troubled teen uh sneaking around her neighbor's abandoned gotten to her about having those things somebody besides julie maxwell purchased other items maybe we should go back and find out who purchased those other items if there's a security footage entered the room of like the mastermind of all of this and we're like she's a poor teeny and you're fear of a little girl about to shoot a police officer or a fear of a girl about to do something metaphysical i think i think we i think we probably got both but i i would suspect that
457.36 617.28 speaker1  she learned some things about what she had in her possession i think we should go back as she's flipping through the through the big book gosh uh there were three items recently bought from booth 504 there was a camera that was bought with a check and uh that was from
612.56 622.16 speaker2  but i think he definitely would have spent time around a church growing up what is the first
617.28 626.88 speaker1  church of contention baptist Scientologist it's uh we're not it's just the first church of
622.16 704.48 speaker2  contention we're not gonna call it one denomination is more evil than the other they're all pretty would have followed up with this with you on this on our first visit but uh thank you for
696.24 732.72 speaker1  when she says no that no one asked her about these items she seems scared are you sure nobody
728.08 833.76 speaker2  to where you have your hand on a gun why don't you start talking you two-faced shit sandwich if you're here for us here's what's gonna have to happen your life and contention is over you have
828.88 848.64 speaker3  helping you're helping maybe save lives here now can you can you remember anything else about him
842.00 874.56 speaker1  you know he had he had gin blossoms all over his nose and under his eyes love that man and he had
870.96 904.40 speaker3  in contact with him do you want you to follow up with him ever said he'd be watching
898.80 1071.20 speaker2  i'm thinking we need to go talk to uh what's the physician's name marie jacobs yeah what time is together or something we'll find out later something crazy so it bumps the top of the
1065.76 1135.84 speaker1  like to avoid hitting a sign on the side of the road and then gets back on the road and as it is going north on the road from forgotten treasures clark you are in position right behind the white toyota and john lee pettymore you are taking up the rear right behind clark bishop seat of the white toyota cool clark how are you handling the situation from a driving perspective
1131.68 1177.12 speaker3  cautiously but still trying to maintain as much speed as i can but still seeing how safe i can be about the oncoming traffic if i'm if they're stopping i'm going but if they're don't look
1168.32 1245.20 speaker1  swerves out of the way of the traffic as he goes through the intersection nimbly dodging a car clark bishop you are about to hit a car coming in from the right too hot didn't see your sirens didn't uh didn't hear you so you have to like hit the brakes yeah in order to uh avoid a collision there as john lee petty more just like slides like through the intersection and flies through it on the tail of the white toyota keith what do you want to do i'm gonna flash my gun at the is going like 60 65 miles an hour on a 45 and gaining speed john lee petty morn it is up to you
1240.80 1256.72 speaker2  just going to try to get ahead of him and make him stop or run off the road how close is he to
1251.20 1264.88 speaker1  10 yards 15 yards behind the white toyota and you guys are 20 yards behind his cruiser you
1261.12 1306.08 speaker3  even if he does manage to get to the side or around it i'm gonna still kind of be taking up
1299.12 1370.00 speaker1  a hand go out the driver's side window with a something that is on fire in the hand and he throws a bottle molotov cocktail awesome and it is flying through the air i need you to roll against his throw on a drive check in order to avoid the molotov cocktail heading straight exactly but it does catch the the back corner of your car and and you're not sure whether or not a fire has started or whether or not just the exterior of your car is on fire currently clark shatter off in in that direction as you guys are pulling up closer this is the most alive
1365.92 1385.04 speaker2  i think he did dude we gotta take this guy out i already have reached back and picked up the shotgun and i'm waiting to roll my window down until we can get close enough to him because i
1379.76 1534.16 speaker1  swerved to the left and you guys pulled up right next to him so the two of you are side by side with the white toyota right in between you right ahead of you clark is there anything you want to forward but you are heading directly for a t so there's no straight there's only right or left coming up and the white toyota is going to whip it to the right so as you guys hit this turn please keith 21 on a 70 awesome and you were aiming for a tire front right tire yeah as he takes this right turn clark you try to fishtail him you make connection however he turns into it and begins to avoid the fishtail maneuver however keith vigna blows his front right tire as he's doing so which would pull him harder right hard right yeah so that is going to complete the fish there until you guys can move to get him out because i'm not trying to pop around so john
1530.56 1556.24 speaker2  guys are in a position to go like to block him from the front we can just get them blocked in
1549.36 1576.32 speaker1  of the car you've got a shotgun in your hands and he is going to begin firing at you okay are you going to attempt to take cover or fire back so if i was coming up to his passenger side i'm gonna
1572.40 1586.88 speaker2  i don't want to like shoot at him yet i don't want to try to kill him but i want to get at a good
1582.00 1665.52 speaker1  breaks out the glass of his uh the on the passenger side of the white toyota and then in the passenger backseat side he shoots out that glass too as he's trying to get at you
1659.44 1681.60 speaker2  trunk and see is he still in inside of his car yeah with all the doors closed yeah if i like pop up pop up over the trunk and look and see inside of his car through the back window is his
1675.76 1704.72 speaker1  front he's in the driver's seat he is looking your direction he's kind of looking all around but he just fired back through there and so he's panicky how would you feel if i was him bad
1699.92 1781.68 speaker2  fire off a warning shot of the shotgun to where maybe like a couple pellets hit like the side of his ear or his head the rest just go like like a like a like a but not right at him okay so
1779.92 1792.24 speaker3  shit okay um
1785.60 2033.36 speaker1  so you uh you blast into this car you were trying to shoot to the right of him but you really you just fired directly into the back of his seat there is a mist of red going all over the front of the car as the horn begins to blare and the slumped body of charles is leaning directly into the steering wheel his face making the horn incessant what happened and then heard more shots coming your way what do you want to do open fire back the door you see he is bleeding out all sorts of crazy basically from his nipples to his uh you're trying to do but 28 on a 30 oh well done you grab at his i don't know pulse one of them where you are you think you you know your way around a wrist or a neck however no pulse is
2027.92 2066.32 speaker2  he's he's real dead ah fucking i hate paperwork can we cover this up maybe just make it look like couple more shots into the air and tell them to disperse roll firearms what are we around up up
2061.28 2192.00 speaker1  cars like two cars have pulled over and they're just sitting there staring phones out do they one of the people just gets into somebody else's car and they they're nice enough to take them out this car you see there's a there's a handgun in his hand in the seat next to him there's a rifle a burner phone a wallet and some keys all in the back seat all in the back seat i want to on it whatsoever and as you open up the wallet there's an army id for a billy harrison he's a pretty fit dude bald guy young guy probably in his uh late 20s early 30s wouldn't it say on the id
2188.16 2212.40 speaker2  for some reason i was picturing like a tundra i actually just pictured us chasing a ford bronco
2203.12 2490.72 speaker1  back here okay so as you pop open the trunk there is a man is completely unconscious is it billy harrison he looks exactly like billy harrison he is alive though yeah he's unconscious he's are going over charles he has id on him named charles donovan he is from the city he's got a them both immediately one is john peter's house and the other is the piston pig farm the keys that are in the ignition of the white toyota include a key to a room at the motel my motel the one that keith vigna is staying at and there is a key fob for dirty dog grooming charles donovan also has scratches all over his arms legs and face do they look like fake the set of scrubs has an id that says dr zebrowski and the black suit inside one of the as you're looking over charles's body helping clark discern the scratches that are all over him you see that the scratches are in the pattern of of hands and it looks like a human human's hands
2485.52 2561.12 speaker2  all these credentials to see if there actually is a dr zebrowski somewhere in state following up on the fbi credentials for agent parks see if that's a real person and then uh john is gonna go over
2554.16 2604.32 speaker1  and do not succeed and immediately they're like we got to get him help they throw him on a stretcher and put him in the back of the ambulance i'm gonna go with him in the ambulance just in case
