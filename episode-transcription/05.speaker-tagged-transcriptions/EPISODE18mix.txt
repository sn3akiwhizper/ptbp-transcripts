0.00 251.44 speaker0  Hello all my nephews and nieces, it is your fun uncle, Wolf the Dog, and I'm here to weird y'all out from 694.2 PTBP Contention's Greatest Radio Show. This episode is brought to you by Fire Lizard Games, a tabletop games company based in Springfield run by just three brothers. They currently have a Kickstarter launched in their first game, Base, a card PG. Base is a setting agnostic storytelling game using a simple, uniquely designed system. They designed the game to be appealing for everyone, whether you are a newcomer to roleplaying games or a stone cold pro. All you need to play the game is the rulebook, a standard deck of cards, and a few six-sided dice. The Kickstarter tiers start as low as $3 and it will end on April 16th, my babies. Give them a follow on Facebook for your buddy Wolf, or Instagram, or Twitter, or how about all three, at Fire Lizard Games for more updates. And now let's get back to my favorite segment, Howlin' with Wolf, where we get to hear from our caring, adoring, and intelligent listeners. This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Hot Donna on Twitter, who writes, After careful consideration, my request is as follows. Instead of making an actual announcement, I would love for Wolf to make one incredibly long and possibly melodic fart noise. Ahem, I guess it might go something like, preferred his older son, Ferguson. as strange, gaunt men in suits appeared to fall from the sky and were shot down by the Bean's security personnel. Later that night, William Beans gave Ferguson a watch and told him about a prophecy that says he will save the world. Back in whatever year it is now, the officers took the pastor's helmet to the police station and locked it up with the other items from the booth at Forgotten Treasures. The light on the camera was green, so John took a picture of Keith outside the station. Unsurprisingly, the picture was not of Keith, but of two men in a strange room that lacked color. On the way to the mill, on the other side of the city, John saw something strange in the sky, causing a fiery three car wreck on the main longitudinal drag of contention. Taking us to that scene now, is Kudzu with no backbone.
248.60 262.88 speaker1  I got an 86 on a 50. Okay.
256.00 281.88 speaker2  You have the choice to either stay put in the exact position that you're in or to move. Now real quick, I'm going to have you all roll a D6 for hit points to see how many you lost from the wreck. Four. One.
280.24 284.08 speaker1  Luke said he was at 19.
283.08 286.08 speaker2  My name is Keith.
285.08 290.08 speaker0  Oh no.
289.08 305.88 speaker1  Luke, it's you.
303.56 309.88 speaker2  Do you move or do you stay put? I move.
307.88 316.68 speaker1  Is my car still operational? I move. Okay.
315.68 428.32 speaker2  Just John. John, you lose one willpower and I need the other two to roll a D4 for me. One. Three. Well, Clark Bishop is at seven willpower, John Lee Pettymore is at 11 willpower. When you get down to one or two willpower, you're at a negative 20% on all rolls. Now, Keith Vigna, having lost willpower at this point, you were back at a negative 20% on all rolls. And so your high of your cane- It was so harsh, dude. It was harsh as fuck. You no longer have the- I do more. Advantages. So you guys are all in the car wreck and John passed his power roll and so he's spending one willpower to move. Keith and Clark both failed their power rolls and so they had to roll a D4 in order to find out how much willpower they were going to lose in order to move. Keith is losing one willpower point to move. Clark failed and is spending three willpower points to move. Clark is driving one cruiser with Keith sitting shotgun and John is driving the cruiser ahead that got rear ended by Clark's cruiser. John's luck is 55. Yes. 98. And he fails. So I need you to roll a dexterity check to try to get out of your seat, which your seat belt is completely jammed and you're stuck in your seat currently. 11. Critical success. You want to describe how you get out of this car in a very cool way?
427.32 442.40 speaker1  Yeah. We describe how I'm stuck again real quick.
436.52 475.36 speaker2  went into the console of your cruiser, breaking through the plastic on either side of the steering wheel and so your knees are like cut up and bleeding from the plastic and you hit your head on the steering wheel and so you're kind of dazed and your seat has moved forward in a way to where your seat belt has jammed you into position. He chews his way out. Like a rat in a...
473.28 496.16 speaker1  few times and gets lucky. bit more about the situation as I get out because what I'm really interested in is what's
495.16 543.22 speaker2  Absolutely. So as you make it out of your police cruiser, you would notice not only has your police cruiser caught fire, but you look over and you actually see the other vehicle that you ran off the road by swerving into their lane. It's a minivan. It is flipped over and it is currently leaking fluid all over the ground. Keith, I need you to roll luck. Your cruiser with Clark driving smashed into the back of John's cruiser. Your airbag went off. It knocked you back and...
542.22 544.22 speaker1  Grab it.
543.22 587.94 speaker2  Grab it with the door. Your side of the car got completely smashed in and so your door is unable to open. So you're going to have to smash through the window to get out of this vehicle. So I need you to roll strength for me. All right. So... I... Give me a second to think about it.
586.62 602.62 speaker1  So yeah, I do that. And then do I have a move or...
597.22 624.78 speaker2  you would notice that this cruiser that you were in, Clark's cruiser, is also leaking fluid all over the ground underneath the vehicle. Clark, I need you to roll luck for me. I mean, you already spent your three willpower to make a move action this round.
623.78 633.18 speaker1  Okay, awesome.
628.86 657.82 speaker2  car and you would also see John's cruiser is catching fire. You all look over and see this minivan that has swerved off the road is completely upside down and dark liquid coming out all over the place. Round two. I need everyone to roll power in order to move.
656.10 661.18 speaker1  Your other penis falls off.
660.18 690.18 speaker2  You succeeded. So you're only going to lose one willpower right now?
686.22 692.18 speaker1  But is one closer?
691.18 705.30 speaker2  Okay. Sounds good. You run up to the van. Roll an alertness check for me. Fuck.
704.30 714.10 speaker1  Okay.
708.78 735.74 speaker2  There's a woman driving and a young boy in the front seat.
733.90 741.74 speaker1  fire on my engine. Does it look extinguishable at this juncture?
739.02 745.14 speaker2  So go ahead and roll law for me.
744.14 774.32 speaker1  13. Describe what you do. Calmly and efficiently, like seeing Clark taking care of the civilians, I demonstrate an excellent knowledge of law and procedure. Go right to the compartment. My extinguisher is locked in and calmly, but professionally and with the quickness, I put the fire out.
770.64 791.12 speaker2  The engine is smoking and you see flames licking out from underneath the hood. Keith Vigna, you failed your power check in order to move. I need you to roll a D4 for me, although it doesn't really matter.
790.12 802.24 speaker1  One. That means I'm at zero.
794.96 856.72 speaker2  Keith hops out of the side door of Clark's police cruiser and desperately looks around, smelling the gas, seeing the oil, seeing the flames, seeing this minivan. Your head begins spinning and you black out. The two of you look over and see Officer Vigna, just eyes go blank and he falls backward onto Fight! Okay. Four. John loses four willpower and Clark loses one. I'm now at five. I'm at six. All right.
855.72 865.60 speaker1  Awesome. Fuck you.
863.76 873.72 speaker2  So John, what do you want to do this round?
870.24 895.36 speaker1  Is there enough juice left in the container or do I need to get theirs?
888.64 903.52 speaker2  to let you finish out the rest of this canister on their car, but I need you to roll law in
902.00 937.04 speaker1  Fuck you. Well done. Thank you. Nice. Once again, like fucking calmly as shit, John Lee Pettymore, who has lost a lot of willpower and HP, like bleeding all over the extinguisher. I just nailed that shit and save this family, the passed out Clark's, like all the converging fluids you've been sending at us.
933.84 988.92 speaker2  police cruiser as well as Clark's police cruiser. Clark, you, you are crouched down at this minivan and the flames are growing taller and taller coming out of the bottom of the front of this minivan and the smell is overwhelming. What would you like to do with your turn? They look pretty dead.
984.84 991.00 speaker1  I assume I'm on the, actually I don't assume, what, what side am I on when I, when I walked up to it?
990.00 1022.32 speaker2  What side do you want to be on? I guess I would prefer to be on the passenger side. You are on the passenger side. I break it. Go ahead and roll. You can roll strength or law. I'm rolling strength.
1019.52 1030.52 speaker1  as he falls and then pull, drag him out. And as far away from the cars, I feel as a safe distance, but not too far away because
1029.52 1075.64 speaker2  Absolutely. And as you pull him away from the car, the minivan explodes and I wouldn't say mushroom cloud erupts from this minivan. And the entire thing, I mean, this is loud. of a young girl.
1074.64 1086.20 speaker1  Okay.
1076.12 1091.16 speaker2  You are hearing the sounds of rubber popping and plastic melting and your stimuli are completely
1090.16 1101.68 speaker1  Exactly.
1091.16 1109.08 speaker2  And Clark, you absolutely know that there's someone screaming for help inside this burning vehicle.
1105.24 1120.68 speaker1  That puts me at 36 with a breaking point of 31. Is that how old you are? No.
1119.68 1132.28 speaker2  Okay.
1124.84 1141.68 speaker1  You old motherfuckers is like eight months older than you or something. Yeah. Luke is 17.
1137.40 1145.80 speaker2  I'm almost 17.
1143.08 1162.30 speaker1  I'm almost 17. That's what Keith speaks like after the explosion.
1156.60 1182.38 speaker0  This is how Keith finds his character voice.
1180.82 1189.92 speaker2  Sounds awful. John, what do you do?
1187.18 1207.14 speaker1  Well, I don't know how realistic that is. Have I noticed Vigna lying there? Yeah. Sounds good. What is your first aid? The basic 10%. Cool.
1206.14 1211.46 speaker2  Good luck.
1210.46 1231.82 speaker1  situation. There's like, okay, if I can wrap my shirt around it, then I've seen that in a movie. Break your collarbone. Also, what is the extent of, I'm not like cut up or anything. I'm just- No, you're just like unconscious, right?
1230.50 1236.86 speaker3  Just passed out and probably hit my head. You're probably bleeding from your face a little bit.
1233.82 1239.86 speaker1  I'm trying to slap your face and maybe I like accidentally- A little too hard. Yeah.
1238.86 1290.62 speaker2  Poke you really hard in the eye. It was weird. Jon, you run over to Keith to try to resuscitate him and as you're running over, you actually trip and fall and your knee comes down right on Keith Vigna's nose. and get up, but he is bleeding just way more profusely than he was before. And Keith, I need you to roll, actually, you know what? You did the damage. Jon, go ahead and roll a- Oh, no. D4. I'll really try not to.
1287.62 1303.98 speaker3  Keith, you take one hit point of damage.
1301.78 1309.82 speaker1  Can I discern better if he's conscious or not? Is he lucid at least?
1308.82 1313.58 speaker2  Okay.
1311.78 1333.38 speaker1  How engulfed is the van? Holy. I want to, yeah, I want to run over to the driver's side and just see if I can get close Crit failure.
1330.06 1341.08 speaker2  So I don't know, I don't know how to, you know, what do you guys-
1339.46 1350.58 speaker1  So yeah, it's possible. This episode will probably win the podcast if it won one of the Oscars. I've seen all the best movies.
1349.58 1351.58 speaker3  A potty.
1350.58 1374.98 speaker1  No, they have a name. Blowy. A blowy. If you're saying it's so hot that no human could get close enough to do this, then just
1373.98 1383.02 speaker2  Okay. I'm not going to do it. I'm going to run back to the boy.
1381.30 1386.94 speaker1  unless I have a direct line to paramedics.
1385.30 1390.26 speaker3  We need emergency services up here. We've got some hurt people.
1388.14 1394.90 speaker1  We're just up the road from the clinic. Send ambulances.
1393.90 1411.74 speaker0  Okay.
1410.74 1475.66 speaker2  Fail. Yeah. That's all of my fails from here on out. It's funny because when we started, he thought about holding his gun to do this the whole So after that very funny exchange, you see this boy begin to die. As the ambulances arrive on the scene, two paramedics hop out immediately. One of them comes over, comes up to you, Clark, cause you have the boy. Hey man, what happened here?
1473.66 1489.38 speaker1  I don't, I don't, I don't know.
1485.02 1512.90 speaker2  So they are loading him up on the stretcher as you're, as you're telling them this and they get the boy into the ambulance. The fire truck arrives and firemen hop out and begin putting out the flames on this minivan. What are you guys doing?
1511.90 1534.06 speaker0  They were screaming there.
1531.18 1569.02 speaker2  I'm a horse from a three day bachelor party. Ooh. Naaay. Um. Do not edit what he's saying. out, get Keith on it, get him into an ambulance. Amber lamps. One, you would see them take Keith away on a stretcher as you walk over to the front of a fire machine.
1568.02 1593.82 speaker1  Oh God. I can't. Fire foam.
1592.82 1621.66 speaker2  the cruiser. And when you walk around, you see him and you kind of move some of the foam away from his face. And he is a short balding man with large eyes and a tiny nose. And he has fool seared into his forehead with a brand.
1618.86 1675.18 speaker1  Hey Clark, I think we found John Peters.
1669.54 1707.22 speaker3  early last night so that Santa Claus could come bring me some gifts. So I immediately realized that it's Christmas day. So I excitedly run down the stairs and I see my entire family, my mom, my dad, my brother Ferguson, all sitting around a bunch of gifts. Half of them are already open and they all turn their heads at me.
1706.22 1715.50 speaker2  We forgot.
1714.50 1726.02 speaker3  Ferguson. I say, Hey, what, what have you gotten already?
1721.96 1734.06 speaker2  His eyes have looked different ever since your dad gave him that watch. William, your father says, we got Ferguson some games that will help him train for his
1733.06 1777.74 speaker3  That's cool. Maybe once you beat the games, I can play them. Well, they aren't really for you. Can I, I can watch you play them. Okay. Well, Hey, Hey dad. I get, where's my presence at? Uh, Hey Fergie, I'm excited to see what you got.
1771.06 1796.82 speaker2  Ferguson looks to your parents, both of them, sternly shaking their heads and his eyes begin
1790.02 1807.82 speaker3  had all of the rare cards and super rare and all the shiny ones you see Fergie open up
1803.26 1842.52 speaker2  for and dropping hints for the past couple months that this is what you wanted. And Fergie looks up with these begging eyes as your father says, do it. And Ferguson shuts his eyes tight, a single tear running down each cheek as he picks up his Christmas hot cocoa and pours it all into the box filled with these cards of pocket monsters.
1834.44 1863.82 speaker3  I just rip open my gift expecting to see more Pokemon cards, but I open it up and it's a white box, one that I've recognized from years prior from Christmases past and I knew that it contained just clothes.
1859.60 1882.24 speaker2  Something you're not accustomed to since you are typically the recipient of Ferguson's hand-me-downs.
1875.48 1905.28 speaker3  mother and a tear is rolling out of my eye and I say, thank you so much. It is, the sleeves go past my hands. It is at least two sizes too big.
1900.48 1937.90 speaker2  He begins sobbing uncontrollably as he walks toward you. Ferguson beans, wipes his tears away and takes the jacket from off your back, putting it
1936.90 1938.90 speaker1  Ambulance people.
1937.90 1944.70 speaker2  EMT. The EMT. Oh, hey, you're back. How are you feeling?
1943.70 1962.58 speaker3  What?
1961.58 1985.78 speaker2  Oh yeah. So you're still at a negative twenty percent. So you gain two hit points back. Do you think you can stand up? How are you feeling?
1982.02 1998.18 speaker3  Yeah, I think, I mean, my face just hurts. It feels a lot better after that, thank you, but, you know, I think I just, I just took
1997.02 2052.02 speaker2  Okay, for sure. out there. There, it's, I mean, it's not chaos anymore, but there are people running around all over the place, taking care of business. The fire has been put out, they're getting information, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You see John and Clark standing on the other side of John's cruiser, just ahead of you, and you walk out of the back of the ambulance.
2047.50 2056.42 speaker1  For the listeners, Thomas is holding a mechanical pencil that he threatened the life of Luke with. No, just the eye.
2055.42 2057.42 speaker3  What's behind your eye?
2056.42 2059.42 speaker1  Luke, you would look really cool.
2058.42 2081.82 speaker3  No, I don't think I'd look cool with an eye patch.
2074.58 2117.86 speaker2  Okay, so John and, John and Clark are standing in front of John's police cruiser and you've just had this revelation about who the body is. When you guys look up and you see Keith Vigness stumbling out of the back of the ambulance. Wow. Hey, you guys. Okay.
2116.86 2136.46 speaker1  You do. And you said fool was on his head. Correct.
2134.58 2161.10 speaker2  Also, you killed him. He fell on his back. He fell on his back. Like his FAQ. So you would clearly see, well, it's not out of the ordinary for you to try to find a pulse, but this body is extremely dead from what you can tell.
2158.46 2168.22 speaker1  Do I see any remnants of the stuff we saw earlier? No.
2165.74 2171.18 speaker2  saw the body fall from the sky.
2169.22 2227.30 speaker1  And all the stuff happened like around the sky. Did you not see the clouds go crazy? The clouds go crazy. Can you feel my forehead? Fuck. I feel his forehead. Warm, wet, or cold wet? Warm, wet. I'm not seeing things though, buddy. I mean, I'm not, I'm not going to discount it just because of all the stuff we've seen, but I didn't see it, my man. Okay.
2226.30 2228.90 speaker3  in the hood of your car.
2227.30 2230.90 speaker1  I, uh, I pat him on the shoulder. Keith, you all right?
2229.90 2233.90 speaker3  Oh, that hurts. Please don't do that. Ooh.
2232.90 2246.14 speaker1  Ooh. I'm very sore. What, uh, what got you?
2241.08 2252.46 speaker3  got broken, but somehow I fell on the back of my head and ended up with a broken nose. So I assumed the airbag, right?
2251.46 2281.26 speaker1  Oh yeah. It's, it's weird. Looking at you, are you bandaged? Yeah, I'm bandaged up.
2280.26 2300.36 speaker3  and stuff. So I'm feeling beat up, but you know, definitely worse for wear. So I go up to the body and I look down at it and I look up at both of you guys.
2299.36 2332.60 speaker1  Do you know who this is?
2328.68 2342.72 speaker3  I put my sunglasses on and then I take them off.
2341.72 2353.52 speaker1  scene. Okay.
2352.52 2358.68 speaker3  I failed it too. Sanity.
2357.68 2359.68 speaker1  Yep.
2358.68 2375.48 speaker3  71 on a 31.
2374.48 2382.48 speaker2  Roll a D4. One.
2381.48 2387.12 speaker3  Four.
2384.48 2396.28 speaker1  I am at sanity 32 with my breaking point at 31.
2394.12 2404.96 speaker3  I hit my breaking point last time.
2401.80 2409.32 speaker2  We are going to worry about the disorders.
2408.32 2436.24 speaker1  Exactly. Gotcha. Got him. Got him. What kind of clothes is John Peters wearing?
2435.24 2466.52 speaker2  Are they cool jeans? Hold on.
2464.48 2481.92 speaker1  Luke just slammed his face into the wall. What would Leto do? What would Leto do? He just slammed his face. I would like to search John Peters pockets. Get police instincts.
2477.20 2497.08 speaker3  They're full of cum.
2495.52 2499.80 speaker1  Keith, taste it.
2497.08 2502.60 speaker3  Oh, he needs to change his diet.
2501.60 2513.04 speaker2  Sorry. Except cum.
2511.84 2523.76 speaker1  It probably won't.
2522.76 2537.92 speaker2  Sorry. Cummer. I wish I could give you something here. It just doesn't make any sense for him to have anything on him.
2536.92 2552.00 speaker3  Can I do a... Wait, do I have forensics? Okay, yeah. I'm going to do a forensics roll to see how he died.
2550.44 2561.80 speaker1  Can we get a tight hell yeah on that?
2560.80 2573.80 speaker4  Let's try to fight against... How did he die? Yeah, he did. He did nail it. It was 17 for that first roll. Oh, was it? Okay, cool. Oh, really?
2572.80 2587.72 speaker1  Oh, shit.
2585.72 2603.68 speaker3  So an unusable bit.
2596.04 2638.28 speaker2  see the firemen are pulling a woman's charred remains from the driver's seat of the minivan. Is she hot? Don't pull out a dog. Pull out a kid, not a dog. Oh, we should have been a dog.
2635.40 2655.64 speaker1  This is going to stack nicely with... That makes me hit my breaking point. 32 now, I'm at 30 with a breaking point of 31.
2654.64 2662.80 speaker4  I always forget.
2661.62 2677.92 speaker2  From your current sanity. Gotcha, cool.
2673.80 2685.52 speaker1  Joe, I'm bad at math, and that one's a little sad.
2682.52 2730.32 speaker3  not paying attention at all. Perfect. It's like when you have to play basketball, yeah, yeah. Perfect. Because I was too busy messing with the clear face mask they put over me to not break my nose.
2729.32 2733.52 speaker4  No.
2732.52 2743.36 speaker1  Too funny. Oh, man. No, just ridiculous. New cars.
2741.80 2749.72 speaker2  Good thing we're not out of town yet. Thankfully, Keith's Cruiser is still at the police department.
2747.60 2754.16 speaker1  Let's call Drew and have it bring it to us. Grab it. Bring it to us.
2753.16 2768.36 speaker4  We respect you, Drew.
2766.88 2781.28 speaker3  She's not going to be using it. Utilize. We can certainly utilize. It's still police department property.
2776.84 2792.36 speaker1  When we call Drew, can we also have him get a tow truck and bring in our cruisers and maybe start working on fixing them bad boys back in shape? Well, we could also, instead of this mill thing, we could just go to the cruiser store.
2791.36 2793.84 speaker3  That is true.
2792.36 2796.90 speaker2  Drew did fix the four wheeler.
2795.90 2808.52 speaker3  Around town? I mean, following you guys. Put it in neutral.
2806.72 2809.52 speaker1  No, Keith, you're going to have to ride with us.
2808.52 2813.88 speaker3  I'm sorry. Yeah, good, because my drive is-
2810.76 2890.06 speaker1  Hey buddy, we'll have more four wheel adventures real soon. We are going to have to like, yeah. Hey! Hell yeah.
2888.06 2897.20 speaker3  And then let's have the cruisers towed. We can ride with the tow truck back to...
2895.40 2910.20 speaker1  And then he could ride with the tow truck back. Also, the tow tump... The tow truck company is called Towed Truck and they just have a towed logo. Oh, of course. Love it. I like it.
2907.80 2941.48 speaker3  Yeah, that's why it's a toad. We all hop in my cruiser.
2934.72 2949.48 speaker2  He gets out and he looks at all three of you suspiciously and he says... Bubble gum tree.
2948.48 2953.16 speaker1  Bubble gum tree. Bubble gum tree.
2951.96 2958.00 speaker3  I forgot what it actually was. Bubble gum tree.
2957.00 2971.62 speaker2  What happened here? I mean, you don't have to tell me now. I'll see the paperwork later when I fill it out, but that, I mean, this looks crazy.
2968.76 2981.12 speaker1  careened across the highway into oncoming traffic. And because of that, two civilians are dead and another is seriously injured and Keith's
2978.76 2982.60 speaker3  For the record, my penis is still attached.
2981.12 2986.32 speaker1  Oh, they got that back on. I don't know.
2984.60 2992.64 speaker3  It kind of makes me mad since... You were screaming and my penis fell off. I don't know.
2991.64 3014.84 speaker1  I don't know.
3007.76 3046.16 speaker2  Okay, so guys, I hate to do this, but I just got a call from the estate salesman and he's at James's house and he found some unsettling writing in blood and many guns after accidentally triggering some sort of secret door-like trap. I told him probably not, but that you guys would go over and check it out because it seems like it might be a crime scene, what with the weird blood writing and such. Who was James?
3045.16 3048.16 speaker3  He said see you later guy. That's what I thought.
3047.16 3063.90 speaker1  Yeah.
3060.54 3067.54 speaker3  He was the one hunched over the table, foot missing. Also the guy with the vacuum in the neighborhood.
3066.14 3073.66 speaker1  And was he eating a plate of foot?
3072.66 3077.70 speaker3  Oh yeah.
3076.18 3096.34 speaker1  Well, they blew up. Remember? Oh, man. Okay. Again, Joe fucking up.
3089.34 3108.16 speaker3  James slumped at the table with the foot meat or whatever, shot in the head, his foot missing. Holding a gun. Holding a gun. Drew passed out and the Harold Dorsey of what'sbehinddorsey.tumblr.com.
3105.98 3114.38 speaker1  By the way guys, I know who did it. Don't tell us. We got to figure it out. Don't tell us.
3111.16 3119.52 speaker3  A guy with a scar over his eye and a gun.
3117.96 3121.52 speaker2  And we have not seen that guy since.
3120.52 3124.52 speaker1  Correct. Okay.
3123.52 3148.96 speaker2  Okay. After Drew says all that, he kind of looks at John Lee Pettymore. Yeah, it'd probably be best. Okay, sure. Yeah. What's up, buddy? And so he kind of pulls you over to the side of the road, maybe off the ditch in the side of the road.
3147.96 3150.96 speaker4  Hey, John.
3149.96 3154.68 speaker1  What's up? Hey.
3153.68 3176.52 speaker2  Oh yeah. What is, what's it say? The deal is going down tonight. Uh, 2am. Whatever, whoever sent it to me said the location will be sent later tonight. All right. I just wanted to give you a heads up, obviously, and not really text about it like we talked about before.
3175.52 3179.08 speaker1  Criminal instincts.
3178.08 3184.28 speaker2  I have to think I learned quickly.
3183.28 3210.24 speaker1  Oh. That's the way the Pettimores look at it. Absolutely. And if you can pull this off, I'll give you 5% of my share. Okay. All right. I want you to try to negotiate with the Duke and say, hey man, we're the ones with the drugs. We picked the location and I wanted to come out to my farm where we got the drugs buried. Okay. Sounds good.
3209.24 3217.24 speaker2  You're a good man.
3216.24 3231.36 speaker1  Okay. Sounds good.
3230.36 3256.16 speaker3  Hey, dude. I know, like, I'm really sore. I remember not losing consciousness in the car and my nose definitely wasn't broken. Can I do a human on?
3252.08 3283.00 speaker1  Well, hey, Clark didn't actually see this, but I like that you think this is going to somehow possibly make up at all. Not going to work. He's probably going to break it again.
3282.00 3313.20 speaker3  So good on you for that. That was good. but I don't think that's on you. I think I'll be hearing those screams for a while though.
3307.72 3334.64 speaker1  So as, as I walk up, I like slap a big hand on Keith's back and I'm like, Hey man, really sorry about the nose. I was rushing over, trying to give you some existence and I, uh, I tripped on your big pants and kind of need you right in the face there.
3333.64 3351.64 speaker3  Yeah. I know that I was about to say like, you know, I'm a, I don't know if I would have done the same thing for you. Not out of spite, but out of pure fear. I mean, yeah, I would have definitely helped you too. Sorry. I said anything.
3349.08 3383.56 speaker1  Uh, John isn't like thinking about your faux pas. He's just like, did Keith call me brave? Yeah. you need. Hell yes.
