0.00 72.88 speaker0  What's everybody do? Keep going. Oh boy. My name is Zach and this is pretending to be people We are a role-playing podcast and we are playing the game Delta green, but it's not really Delta green It's an amalgamation that we have come up with that is a mixture of the role-playing systems Delta green and pulp Cthulhu with all that nerdy shit out of the way for the rest of you listening This is a collaborative storytelling experience that you will be listening to over the coming weeks I am here with Joe. Hey, I'm Joe Luke. I'm Luke and Thomas I'm Thomas having heard many stories from other DMS GM's out there. I consider myself to be We ran two ten-month-long Delta green campaigns where we played weekly and we've kept the exact same group ever since I
69.24 107.08 speaker2  Wanted something a little more story based and less mechanics driven I didn't like sitting around for 30 minutes while the wizard took his turn. So Delta green was perfect for that It's all about character interaction and like solving this mystery together and combats are very like combat is very simple quick and rare and rare Yeah, and violently, you know, you're shooting guns at each other. It ends it gets over with quickly
102.72 133.20 speaker0  Didn't take it very seriously and our DM took it very seriously So we were not invited back to play Loved it. I've pretty much constantly been playing it since I
128.44 157.08 speaker2  D&D game with some mutual friends of ours and I I think unbeknownst to him I had already been kind of wanting that I had been listening to podcasts and watching shows on Twitch and things like that So we did it It was it was awesome to have that all of a sudden pop up that group didn't last for very long But pretty quickly after that dissolved Thomas again asked if I wanted to join you guys and I said fuck
155.08 218.62 speaker0  seriousness to our table Very first time that you role-played with us you were playing Taylor my wife's partner And then we had one of our best sessions to date right then and there it was amazing Hey, baby I hope that you guys become our best friends the way that I have become best friends with my role-playing group
215.92 233.88 speaker2  We try to not talk about it too much outside of the game We really want to be surprised by each other and by Zach
228.56 269.28 speaker0  We've kind of talked and you guys have given me full reign to fuck over your characters Which is a very fun thing to give your DM the right to do and I try to take full advantage of that But outside of that everything is improv. It is also a closed game. Oh, that's a really good point Luke So we play a closed game so anytime one of these characters goes off on their own the player also sits in the room with Just me and we go through what happens that way the players can keep secrets from each other
264.12 292.26 speaker2  It's like secrets and lies the name of the game that continues outside the podcast, too We try not to talk to each other about what's going on in the game too much
289.10 461.62 speaker0  This isn't just because we use the fuck word It's also because a lot of the descriptions within the story are going to be gruesome and brutal with We hope you think it's funny So we got together and we created a small town together that this story would take place in Contention contention is the name of this fictional town in this fictional universe that is based Loosely on our own world people could easily relate this to x-files or Season 1 of true detective pretty much anything that has a creepy supernatural Ambiance to it, but we're also going to try like to keep it funny Story in which these three guys are playing police officers of this small town of contention We did this for a couple reasons It's an easy way to get them involved in a mystery within their small town and have the power and the free time To look into said mystery very excited to have our friend Justin involved in this podcast He will be the first voice that you hear as Justin is playing wolf the dog the a.m radio DJ in the town of contention who will be our narrator and Introduce each episode. He is also responsible for creating the original music that you will hear backing this We hope that you continue to listen now Let's get that a.m. Dial in position to six nine four point two and hand it over to wolf the dog
460.78 565.54 speaker2  Only Radio station some of you surrounding listeners might not know contention like we all do here But it's a small quiet town about an hour west of the city Dogs are barking going crazy and I've been seeing a lot of homeless folks lately But you know be kind to those throw a little change the way for your buddy wolf the dog And I want all you listeners out there to wish police chief Maggie cook a very very happy Oh Oh You heard it here first folks Jim Belushi not a good actor yeah hot takes so let's go ahead and talk
563.38 590.96 speaker1  He's a 17 year vet It hasn't risen up the ranks kind of cuz there's not a whole lot of rank upping to go But he's a little bit sad about the fact that he's still where he is in life But he also takes a lot of pride in his job and he's okay at it Luke what character you playing
585.18 670.50 speaker0  grew up in contention and then I had a big aspirations moved to the city where I Became a police officer was not that great at it and they kind of transferred me back to the town Just to get rid of me bad cop.

Take a big old dump in my pants if I need to and nobody will know nobody I think of don't know Well, our story does begin on an unseasonably warm December 1st in a small town called contention Thin mist can be seen under the street lights on an empty country road the inside of the contention police department However is cozy warm and bright a smiling man sits behind a large secretary desk littered with papers and snack wrappers He has a round baby face and small teeth and he is wearing a sweater vest over a shirt and tie
805.14 824.02 speaker2  This man's phone rings this guy by the way, he's the secretary in the office. He's like the office or his gums big or
818.28 847.40 speaker0  I kind of picture him as like like small teeth, but very very healthy gums. Oh, those are some real Yeah, he's wearing a sweater vest over a shirt and tie and his phone rings
842.68 866.36 speaker2  Which happens often in the office? We cannot be vaping on mic all the time

872.12 907.20 speaker1  I do have all your mics
903.40 924.84 speaker0  I'm like, oh, yeah, we're just playing some Dungeons & Dragons and he goes, oh, that's cool Have you ever heard of Delta Green? Shit you not I'm like, that's actually what we're playing and he's like no way it I'm like, yeah
923.28 934.74 speaker2  First fan
931.22 1118.50 speaker0  What do you look like he just kidding we know what he looks like So this guy his phone rings and he picks it up like before the first ring is finished the big the big gum guy So His phone rings and he picks it up before the first ring is finished drew Andrews Do we need to send out multiple of you or just do you think everything's gonna just send ray? Oh, okay and drew Andrews this man with the gums and the Small teeth comes out from the back room and he's got a little cupcake and it's got one candle in it and the candles lit and he goes over and knocks on the door of the chief of police of She's a strong fit woman with a dark bob and intense eyes Always in uniform this woman you've never seen her not wearing her uniform He pulls out this little gift that's wrapped and she opens it and it is a new journal And you guys would know that she always has a blue journal with her like a notebook everywhere She goes and it's the specific brand that she likes. And so this one is yellow Oh, so now you have one of each color, isn't that it's neat. Thank you so much drew I really appreciate you doing that for me
1113.06 1133.84 speaker2  Go into my desk and I pull out like two-thirds of a bottle of cheap bourbon. Hey, here you go Maggie
1129.20 1146.20 speaker0  With the the three-quarters of a bottle that I have sitting on my bar cart from last year I appreciate that and then you all kind of look over at Keith who and I'm I'm
1143.08 1158.64 speaker2  Sweating because I had no idea that it was her birthday
1151.64 1338.22 speaker0  She looks and there is a box that's sitting in the room. That's this white box with a black bow on it Oh Keith Oh my god, and she immediately walks back into her office and closes the door behind her I guess and it was probably right it might have been right and right about at that moment The chief comes walking out of her office and she is completely broken down Tears have clearly been streaming down her face. Her face is red. You've never seen her in this emotional state before Keith Immediately walks from her door out of the office Chief So when you walk into her office, it's neat. It's like a super office Inside of it. There's no paper or anything. I need a tag or anything on it. There's no tag on it There's just three items inside the box. It is a flower. It's a rose. It's a single rose There's a hard hat just like a straight-up normal white hard hat and a black silk bowtie. I want to plop that
1332.66 1351.00 speaker1  Her office and look in the box and I pick up the tie and I want to see if there's any like is it monogrammed
1348.62 1419.50 speaker0  He hangs up and he looks at you guys and he's like Um fellas Somebody found a body out at the junkyard I Think this is an actual emergency you guys I Don't I don't know they hung up immediately she it was a woman's voice and she said that there was a body at the junkyard and that we needed to come out and And look at it immediately and she was she's kind of slurring her words Did you get her name? She just said Julie and then stopped immediately I don't know what happened, but there was like a I heard something kind of not break But I heard something kind of there was a noise and then she like screamed a little bit after she said her name And and then and then she hung up immediately and you said this out at the junkyard. Yeah Go check it out. Okay, so you guys all have
1418.50 1427.58 speaker2  Just in case I'm with you
1425.58 1540.58 speaker0  I don't think they see that So the three you'd go ahead and grab that pull off the bottle before you head out and the three of you are going out It's a dark night. I'd say it's pretty nice It actually feels more like fall than it does winter at this point in December 1st But there's like a light mist coming down. So I would say it's real dark out You got the streetlights guiding your way the junkyard sits on the far Southeast corner of town and it's where the old mine was This is an old mining town back in the 1800s and the junkyard is out on top of where the the old mine was throwing junk down the shaft Oh, yeah Yeah and so you guys are gonna drive from downtown out on a few country roads to get out there and There is a car coming from the other direction that is flying going Maybe double the speed limit. It's probably 45 out here and this car is going 80 90 miles an hour Swash it around
1538.58 1556.10 speaker2  Dollar
1551.58 1714.02 speaker0  So the three of you are driving down this road in this car flies by you as anyone pulling off Clark Bishop Continue on to the junkyard and John Lee Pettymore Turns his car around and I immediately if the lights weren't on I assume that they are on now and you're in chase mode Thomas to see if John Lee Pettymore can catch up and successfully pull over this car But she is about to hit more into the town and less of a country road You're gonna go ahead and want to pull her over as soon as possible. I do that nice So he had a 70% and drive drive being the skill and he rolled a 20 which is a success So you want to roll underneath your score if he rolled a 22 with the tens dice matching That would be a critical success And then if you roll above your skill, which just happened which just happened It's a failure because your luck is 50, right? Yep, and he rolled a 55 which the dice match and it's above Which means it is a real fail the car in front of you loses control and immediately Crashes into a telephone pole Can pull over however you want to so are you going alongside in front of behind like how are you pulling up on this?
1711.32 1728.82 speaker2  Oh, I don't have to I don't have to have an accent when I'm describing my
1724.74 1765.72 speaker0  She was thrown clear of the vehicle and she is alive You can actually hear her like screaming and moaning about 20 yards away
1761.72 1805.90 speaker2  I've got no medicine skills and I have 10% first aid. Yeah
1799.22 1894.92 speaker0  You guys pull up and the headlights are shining through an old rusty chain link fence and through the end of the fence You see at the end of the lights reach of your headlights The ground is splattered with blood and a lifeless body is crumpled on the moist dirt about 20 yards past the fence inside this junkyard is The gate locked to the gate is locked. Is there barbed wire? There is barbed wire The Pistons this is the piston junkyard and the NBA team. Yep, the Detroit pistons. Hey Clark Leo and George and they are the piston brothers I think that Clark Bishop would know these two from back in the day Clark Okay, give him a call come have him unlock this I don't have to cut through if we don't need to but let him know it's a serious situation
1889.12 1941.20 speaker1  Leo hey Leo. Hey. Hey. Hey, it's it's Clark Clark. Hey We've got a situation up here at your yard Clark who? Bishop with the contingent PD, you know me Leo We've got kind of a thing going on up here at your yard We need to we need you to come down here and let us in in the pig farm. No your junkyard. Oh
1939.20 2043.06 speaker0  But hasn't been taken care of recently Rust is starting to grow on it He pulls up and a large man in overalls covered in pig shit gets out You know kind of waddling I guess is the right word towards you guys and he's got this big circle ring of Keys that he's already like in the darkness trying to thumb through trying to find the right one fully fleshed out Character and a human being we love and we love and respect sweep up Two weeks ago, you haven't been here for two weeks. It's George was George here today
2037.90 2059.22 speaker1  Yeah, Kathy, who's Kathy? No, it's a George's wife. You know, do you know? Okay. Oh Kathy, of course, of course
2057.94 2084.34 speaker0  Oh He's so scared like looking in his eyes he is the scariest boy I
2081.06 2106.22 speaker2  Slap him on the shoulder. I said, I'm just kidding. You haven't been here in two weeks
2099.58 2128.64 speaker0  He's very he's very quick with his fingers and he gets the key off the ring immediately and hands it to you and it's like
2126.46 2144.00 speaker2  Just be prepared to have a little conversation tomorrow
2142.00 2219.48 speaker0  Nervously and leaves So the the gate opens two of you walk in and you're looking around this junkyard. It is a massive junkyard We're talking 10 acres of land I mean this thing is massive and there's junk piled up every which direction right in front crumpled up dead body with blood splattered all around it in every direction and it is sitting right in front of They're basically the only building on this entire land Mass that is kind of serves as like an office It's a quickly put up almost like trailer It's got one door one window kind of place and it's got the sign on it piston junkyard all that jazz
2214.50 2226.32 speaker2  But uh, do you have that the camera equipment lights and stuff in your car? Is that in I do? Okay, you got it
2224.04 2240.32 speaker0  I'm gonna take a peek at it. Yeah, okay
2237.44 2255.44 speaker2  We know one thing I'm gonna interrogate the body roll human
2253.44 2365.58 speaker0  splattered in a circular Range around this body in every direction So it looks like this body was thrown here or dropped here Looking around though. The ground is wet a little bit. It's like the ground is the ground is moist and There there are no footprints in the area except for your own But it does seem to be the body of a woman. Why can I not see its face? Well, okay, you can see her face, but the face is smashed completely Beyond recognition beyond all Can I can I see if there does she have teeth or finger fingers?
2363.42 2373.90 speaker2  Look at these fingers, dude. These are great We can well, I don't know how many she started out with
2368.86 2509.84 speaker0  I hope she has committed a crime at some point. That way we can identify her in our database Parchment on it is written in this weird black thick ink and it says We is striking when the land gets darkness readying torches hesitate not Besides that note in the pocket. That seems to be all you can really garner from it It has punctuation it is we is striking when the land gets darkness period readying torches period hesitate not period It's just written as it could fit on this piece of paper John Lee Pettymore is at the scene and the ambulances arrived. They are going to ask you what happened
2503.24 2516.40 speaker2  I've not seen that's anything like that in a while. Obviously, you know sprint car race and you see your fair share of smashed faces
2513.80 2540.94 speaker0  Well, we need to get her to the hospital. And so they start
2533.54 2579.46 speaker2  Bamboo wood and cheesecloth and they get her in the back of this ambulance and falls right through the cheese Zombie Oh, yeah, take a swig out of that to steady my nerves and then I'm gonna check her car out I'm gonna do a search probable cause out the ass
2573.66 2704.48 speaker0  You're good to check the car when you're going through it in the back seat of the car is a it's a Polaroid Camera and it seems to be from early early Polaroid camera making days. You've never seen a camera like this It's got the normal like chunkiness to it But it's got some like weird glass tubes that go around it and on it is a light that is red and it has a viewfinder and a button to take pictures and Then a spot for the paper to go in and a spot for the paper to come out and then all these glass tubes Yeah, I forgot to mention there is a Polaroid sitting in the seat of the car In the shotgun seat. It is a Polaroid. It shows the base of a tall building and a group Crowding the entrance with fists raised Everything in the picture is lit by torches in some of the people's hands and the building is a slightly shiny pitch black The entire picture is not fully like colorized It almost seems black and white but the the light from the torches is giving off some sort of like a yellowy Hard fail, okay Off of the old whiskey. So yeah, this is really weird. Like you've never seen anything like this You've probably not messed with Polaroids too much in your life, but you definitely know that if you do notice that on this camera where the red light is coming from there is also a
2700.60 2713.04 speaker1  Unlit green light next to it. So the red light is illuminated. Yes. Gotcha
2707.88 2726.76 speaker2  That's supposed to go into this or a place for that to go somewhere that might activate that green light
2722.60 2929.04 speaker0  Basically one is colored red and the other one is colored green and the red light is shining He's all alone and he is standing with a camera that is odd in his hands Aiming it at different things and looking at nothing in particular multiple gas cans and A bunch of lighters and matches classic firebug. Yes Where did we leave you guys? I guess we found that note and search role I Do not pass you do not find anything and Joe Clark Bishop is walking up to the Building the front door of this building and it is unlocked. I go in it is a small room There's only one room There's a desk that is like literally covered in papers and garbage and a bunch of shit just everywhere There's a couple chairs in there that are also covered with shit and there's a bunch of filing cabinets This place is deeply disorganized and no one has been in here in a while Yeah, and you would also see that it does point at the front door, which looks out the window
2925.28 2959.94 speaker1  Police officer to look at the tape in that VCR. Would he take it back to the shop?
2957.66 2972.14 speaker2  Maybe I can do a roll and see if it was
2969.82 2995.72 speaker0  No, that's how that's how life works cool So you guys at this point could you could have ray come out and watch this scene for the night?
2994.76 3010.44 speaker2  Yeah I'd like to have your input on this. Give me a call back. Bye. I think that was good. Love you did great
3007.56 3059.24 speaker1  Keith did you just call the chief Maggie?
3055.28 3088.74 speaker2  Sorry about that last voicemail. Everything I said was true, but I want to We'll call you chief Okay, so we haven't seen John in a minute Let's I'm gonna radio him and see what is what's going on over there
3084.30 3118.78 speaker1  Sets darkness when the land sets darkness gets darkness
3112.52 3139.90 speaker2  Poor driving was she drunk or what was it? Are you drunk? I never know these days vigna You should have seen this face. This is got me pretty shook. Well, do you need what are you doing right now? Do you need help? I'm just trying to make this camera work
3135.52 3155.90 speaker0  Ray is gonna take care of cleaning up the car on the side of the road. That's been smashed He's gonna call a tow truck and let everybody know what needs to be taken care of there Well, it's about time he did something. Yeah, he's also gonna Go out to the junkyard and keep watch over the crime scene for the night, which you put up crime tape and all that
3150.78 3167.90 speaker1  Jazz, I wanted to express to Ray that we do want the coroner to like autopsy won't be one
3164.50 3220.58 speaker0  You're probably all out in the parking lot now is about when you would either I don't know All right okay to County and
3218.30 3226.58 speaker2  Mm-hmm. Can you have you ever seen a camera this queer?
3220.58 3242.26 speaker1  I don't think I've ever seen anything like this before it looks kind of old with the glass tubing like that I know they used to use that some of them old radio. Yeah, but this this ain't a radio Clark. Yeah
3236.74 3271.86 speaker0  I want to look at the picture. The picture is a Polaroid of a base of a tall building There's a group of people crowding the entrance their fists are raised Everything in the picture is lit by torches in some of the people's hands and the building is a slightly shiny pitch black But the only coloring that you see is from the torches and it's like an orange ish yellowish hue Everything else is black and white roll sanity
3269.54 3279.14 speaker1  Do I recognize the building by any chance a place?
3277.14 3340.74 speaker0  anyways, because it's literally just like I got this from Julie Maxwell's car. Wait, does that the car you pulled over?
3332.86 3348.74 speaker2  Torches one woman's face was smashed another woman's face was split entwined. What was Julie wearing?
3346.74 3354.46 speaker1  What was her are you asking me? Looking like
3351.14 3360.34 speaker2  What was her clothing looking like let me stop to recollect
3357.58 3369.38 speaker0  Middle-aged woman who is stuck in the 80s
3366.78 3405.30 speaker2  Who's the one who still thinks it's 1985?
3403.30 3408.30 speaker0  Oh god
3405.54 3412.86 speaker1  Oh, yeah, no, she's dead Julie Maxwell's
3409.10 3455.38 speaker2  She's a cop to severe blood loss. She's dead. She's just rolled a hundred Sleeper and think about what I've seen today This was my first dead body and I'm kind of creeped but also a little bit stoked. Oh, yeah
3452.62 3514.80 speaker0  yeah, so you're gonna want to head and lose one and Just a quick note for you guys. We're gonna run this as a sanity We'll run as like a humanity tracker to see how much you care about Humanity everything that you see that makes you doubt the like goodness and humanity will make you lose Sanity also anything that makes you think that maybe humanity isn't all that's here will make you lose sanity Hey Keith, who do you know in town? Like who are your friends? Who's your family? Do you have anyone?
3508.36 3530.12 speaker2  Any like close family? I've only been here a couple months. So I haven't really made friends I don't hang out with people really the only time I see other people is when I'm at work What's your dog's name? My dog's name is bean. I

3660.36 3693.56 speaker2  Can't really shake this picture. Yeah, he's just kind of looking at it And he probably stays in the station maybe half an hour 40 minutes after everybody leaves Tucked in pearl snap. Yeah, and a pretty fucking sick leather jacket
