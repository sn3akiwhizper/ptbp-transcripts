333.52 357.32 speaker3  It's impossible to explain that joke. Oh, it was the, it's four 20 everybody. Wow. This is the energy we're bringing to the four 20.
354.48 366.40 speaker2  It's the day where you smoke weed and don't ask for help.
364.56 425.24 speaker3  Can you guys, can you let me in? You guys are on the Northeast corner in a downtown intersection of the city. You're just Northeast of the Natcher Hole. You're in a parking lot. You are sitting in Cal Colorado's white Mercedes C-Class. Nice car. And Julius Summers just pulled up. Cal Colorado, Beck Wilder and Stevie were in the Cadillac there and in the Mercedes C-Class there. Come on. A car that you all don't recognize pulls up. It's a car driven by Jeremy, the intern who- He's very, very rattled at all times.
424.08 429.24 speaker2  What's he sound like?
425.24 434.44 speaker3  His eyes are super wide, that's for sure.
432.76 442.08 speaker2  Okay, oh, thank God, oh, thank God.
438.20 458.84 speaker3  after Julius has left and he breathes for seemingly the first time in a while. of the parking spot next to you.
457.44 534.72 speaker2  or not like where I could be hit, You mean the other two? Julius is like standing right there like watching this. with a weird fungal problem that he has on his body? and I'm tired of hearing it. Could you just go be a friend about his embarrassing skin problem. Where are you at? Am I in the car still? outside the passenger seat watching this go on. Yeah, that's true. The reason I clarify though is because So you can just roll down the window and talk to him.
533.88 541.56 speaker3  That's what I'll do. I'll stick my head in Cal's car.
540.24 581.00 speaker2  He's covered from head to toe. Oh, absolutely. His nose is bleeding and you can see a shoulder, like a gunshot in his shoulder. Jesus, is it healed? Like, has it been attended to medically? It happened less than an hour ago. It happened so fast. So speaking to Jeremy, Cal's like, okay,
580.16 582.32 speaker3  Headphones, boys.
581.00 588.04 speaker2  What's going on here? can you tell me what the fuck happened?
586.88 591.18 speaker3  Yeah, get the fuck out. I love you.
590.34 603.00 speaker2  Bye. Okay.
600.28 642.56 speaker3  and nobody went in, obviously, but we called the cops and Julius came out of Type's office with blood all over me. videos and photos and it was so sad and it was just like, he's just like, he's got a gun on him and he's dangerous. He killed the high-freaking.
641.32 652.76 speaker2  this all on his phone.
651.28 670.72 speaker3  I don't know what to do. He told me to drive him to you guys and he knew where you were.
668.64 672.96 speaker2  Who kills their uncle?
672.12 679.20 speaker3  Wait, what?
676.16 708.36 speaker2  the man you thought he was, if what you thought he was was a good man. He was a bad man who did not care about the news. He was ill-suited for his position. I'm not happy he died, but Jeremy, big things are going on today, strange things. We have reason to believe Type was involved with corrupt police officers.
707.24 711.04 speaker3  That doesn't mean, that doesn't, oh.
708.36 735.96 speaker2  Working for the Godel Corporation, they stole our footage of the most insane news story that I have ever personally covered. Type was a part of them, Julius is now too. I guess we already were, but we need your help. I'm so sorry, I meant to persuade you
735.00 740.32 speaker3  This is contested? Yeah.
738.00 748.52 speaker2  Oh, you done got him.
745.84 760.12 speaker3  cause I'm an intern and I don't work for money, I work for truth.
756.56 765.36 speaker2  and he's swelling with pride.
763.72 767.72 speaker3  That's what I'm fucking talking about. That's what I'm talking about.
766.64 777.04 speaker2  That's what I'm talking about.
776.20 790.48 speaker3  That was fun. Yeah. The TV looks at Julius's blood-covered head that is through the window and without missing a beat,
788.88 799.56 speaker2  Julius, what the fuck happened?
794.56 843.84 speaker3  for this face being so close to you. This man being so uninterested in his own... Bodily health. Hey, while you're doing that, Beck. And now if you could roll a... Did you fail? If you could roll a nothing, you just lose one. Lose one grip as this face is just inching near you.
842.96 878.80 speaker2  You were like... Utterly grossed out just because it's blood and viscera. But then I see that there's maybe a bullet wound in the shoulder and I'm like, Holy shit. Julius looks down at it. I mean, I told you, I just got wet. I mean, I'll dry off, it's fine. There's no more to be coming out, yeah. what the fuck are you talking about?
877.32 882.92 speaker3  Luke, how many hit points do you have? Two.
881.76 897.84 speaker2  I sneeze and headbutt. I'm gonna put my hand past his head and pound on the roof
896.60 935.12 speaker3  At that exact moment, he is yelling something equally loud at you. Oh, Thomas. Tommy. Beck, Beck, get away from him. And at that exact moment, Beck is yelling back at you.
933.48 970.36 speaker2  and Jeremy is on our side. but if you let him in my car, I'll be disappointed. I don't know. Is our cherry removable? The thing that we've been running around, the siren light? Oh yeah? I gotta imagine he was like.
968.20 993.28 speaker3  very serious situation goes. It's a wild pitch off to the side and you reach out way for it and it touches your fingers though.
990.92 1002.96 speaker2  So you know deep down you could have caught it. Just like the story if it gets away from us.
1002.00 1012.48 speaker1  that you just got out of. We gotta get you back into that one and we gotta get you to the hospital, dude.
1009.00 1022.40 speaker2  Beck wants to, he feels like he needs to snap Julius into it and he wants to poke the wound to see if that elicits a response.
1018.60 1027.84 speaker3  When he reaches out for you, do you counter?
1026.80 1031.24 speaker0  Fuck.
1030.08 1038.06 speaker2  Can I use your pencil? That would take me to one hit point.
1037.22 1041.26 speaker3  one hit point here.
1039.30 1059.58 speaker2  Can it be taken into account that I wasn't like trying to injure, I was trying to shock. 56 on a 55. You did both. Do you respond to that other than?
1058.74 1061.26 speaker3  Into the car.
1059.58 1072.54 speaker2  Into the car, onto your lap, Now do you believe me, dude? That's a wound, man.
1069.42 1084.30 speaker3  you see yourself absolutely covered in blood and you are in a wild amount of pain
1082.90 1093.66 speaker1  Yeah, yeah, exactly my dude.
1092.82 1096.98 speaker3  Thank you.
1094.94 1102.26 speaker2  Do it for old lady news.
1099.54 1105.66 speaker3  Hand to my, hand to my, hand to my forehead, fingers flat.
1103.46 1124.38 speaker2  Julius hears like get him to the hospital like they're not coming with me and he gets out of the car. We gotta solve it together. Julius, you know, the last time you tried to pull this, no offense, we lost God.
1122.78 1130.38 speaker3  you lost God when I was in the hospital. Who knows what happened when Julius.
1127.30 1139.62 speaker2  Good point, I will not be going to the hospital. And he starts to just kind of try to wipe himself off and like holds the bullet wound.
1137.48 1147.50 speaker3  Go ahead and roll a first aid on yourself if you have it to try to look around and find.
1146.66 1153.02 speaker2  No. Do you have any first aid back there?
1149.62 1169.12 speaker3  You find some fast food napkins in Jeremy's glove box.
1165.38 1175.78 speaker2  It's been scratched out and then replaced, but I have it.
1173.50 1177.70 speaker3  we had at the top of the app.
1175.78 1189.96 speaker2  Okay, yeah, then I don't, nevermind.
1186.38 1205.30 speaker3  because I rolled for first aid. I think base is 30, is that correct? 10. 10, yeah. Okay, so I gave Stevie a plus 20. I rolled both D10s and one said 80 and the other one rolled off the table.
1204.46 1211.30 speaker2  Reroll them both. Yeah. Yes, of course.
1209.36 1216.90 speaker3  As we've always played. So reroll both.
1215.74 1232.54 speaker2  That's a critical success. That's good news. He's back to full health.
1228.40 1240.38 speaker3  any sort of like first aid training was this one summer camp
1238.08 1247.56 speaker2  What kind of summer camp was that? Rich people. Oh, okay. I'll have to do a story about that.
1246.58 1272.90 speaker1  I think it's a bullet wound.
1269.50 1288.18 speaker3  and she pulls that out, goes over to Julius. against the car and just, you know, bite down on this.
1286.70 1295.14 speaker2  What is your max, Luke? 10.
1292.74 1301.82 speaker3  What do you need from me, Mr. Colorado? What does lady journalism need?
1299.66 1314.58 speaker2  We can only cover so many points of entryways to the subway to watch the meeting. So if you can keep them, you know, if you can take up the rear. Subway? Eat fresh. We're meeting Stevie. Julius accepts that as an answer.
1313.74 1327.44 speaker3  He did?
1326.34 1330.26 speaker2  and she's gonna recover it. How many? Just the two, as far as I know.
1329.42 1342.86 speaker3  Which ones? As far as we know, it's the guys that we went to the apartments of.
1339.54 1351.94 speaker2  Not sure if he's gonna die or not.
1350.02 1364.32 speaker3  But he's not bleeding. Blood isn't coming out of the hole anymore. Whereas before, it seemed with every heartbeat, there was just like a little glug.
1363.48 1366.74 speaker2  Yeah, absolutely.
1364.32 1391.88 speaker3  Here's my phone, looking at it right now. Not to lose any or gain any, but to know whether you... Yeah. Now we're married.
1389.22 1393.48 speaker2  You're meeting Richard Riley and Wilson Wiley.
1391.88 1399.28 speaker3  Yeah, because they have the footage, so I just need it back. And that way I can...
1397.92 1434.18 speaker2  That way I can... You're not gonna meet him. Well, no, of course we're not gonna meet them. Yeah. That's the plan. this is as close as you're gonna get to meeting them. They're dead. Both of them? Yeah. They were, well, they were at Cannes.
1432.64 1437.52 speaker1  but I think the first one is, did you get the footage back from them then?
1436.48 1451.36 speaker2  No. What do you mean no? Where was the footage? It all went down so fast. And then I think I just broke.
1450.24 1454.36 speaker3  Holy shit.
1451.36 1463.36 speaker2  And Julius is like a thousand yard stare. Yeah. Hey, Brack, he killed Tife. Tife.
1462.52 1468.32 speaker3  Yeah.
1464.76 1491.80 speaker2  Well, he was gonna destroy the footage too, I think. He didn't want it out. Like this is too much. Do we need to roll grip or? 20 on a 41.
1490.32 1499.08 speaker3  That's my first 69 in a long time. All right, you're gonna gain a D4 of grip back. Ooh.
1498.24 1534.26 speaker2  That's a four. Hell yeah. Oh, nice. It says four on every side of that. Yeah. it's tied up some loose ends and answered some questions, even though others are now posed. But it's like kind of weirdly making sense. Yeah. So Julius, like, holy fuck, you killed him. Don't worry about that.
1532.44 1537.14 speaker3  Well, one of them.
1535.58 1545.50 speaker2  RR or WW. Or, or Tife?
1544.66 1549.50 speaker3  Holy shit.
1548.66 1552.12 speaker2  Could I, could I? Wouldn't even say it.
1550.34 1564.54 speaker4  Could I see your gun? No.
1559.70 1586.90 speaker2  and flashes you and you see two guns on it, on either hip. And then he puts his shirt back down. I'm sure if we went back to the stationers, Yeah. So he was bad, right? A bad man who hated the news.
1584.66 1591.14 speaker1  it sounds like you did what you had to. I mean, they're not like bad.
1588.42 1596.74 speaker3  I mean, they just do whatever the Godot company wants them to do that doesn't make him like necessarily.
1594.38 1609.94 speaker2  They follow orders without thinking, no matter what? They're just following orders? It's like, what's the big deal? Can I hear that, Steve? Oh shit. A serious look, yeah.
1606.36 1625.46 speaker3  Right, okay, so if the, okay, huh. if all of this is happening, do you guys need coffee or anything?
1622.66 1651.74 speaker2  on our way through the door, back at the station. Real quick, back to Stevie. You're not bad, Stevie. You could be, depending on what you choose to do. They like smile. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But you're not bad because you're a Godot. Yeah, not yet.
1650.78 1673.38 speaker3  I used to be a good guy.
1672.10 1702.14 speaker2  Like, is there, is it a crime scene? We've got to accept that there's probably a lot of cops and a crime scene environment there, but we're the perfect cover. We're Can News. We are Can News. We've got to come in and cover it, you know? That's, they'll believe that. I'm Cal Colorado. or was this money being exchanged
1701.02 1707.90 speaker1  So maybe it's on them.
1705.66 1718.26 speaker4  it was probably in Tife's office. Yeah. I mean, maybe. I didn't look too hard. Also, I don't know if there'll be cops there or not. Kind of depends.
1715.62 1724.20 speaker2  And he's like staring at his phone, waiting for-
1722.86 1745.66 speaker4  Julius says. Okay, Julius, like, is staring at his phone for a while and you see it kind of deeing. Guys, I, I want to tell you-
1744.10 1783.42 speaker2  I didn't make that up or anything. for a couple days now. You know what I mean? Yeah, the It Pit pretty much did it in for that. Okay, well.
1781.02 1785.10 speaker4  I don't normally carry guns around, right?
1784.26 1800.62 speaker2  Yeah, yeah, no, no. You didn't really seem like a big gun guy before, except for, you know, those cannons and your, and your, that you call thighs. You are a gun guy.
1797.70 1843.22 speaker4  Well, I have to be in my line of work. but for, you know, the shit we've seen the past few days. Extreme. I don't know, I just have a connection that, that pays me and tells me to, to do things and...
1842.38 1878.26 speaker2  Yeah. 70 on a 70. How does he feel? and I believe that you believe that you're in the X-Files or whatever, but yeah. I mean, so why don't we just get back to the can building And we can talk all about your little alien adventures or whatever. Okay, well, just so we know,
1876.22 1882.74 speaker4  So don't tell anybody. Are you, Julius, are you telling me that you have like an assignment?
1881.90 1892.38 speaker2  What do you, yeah. Do you know more about what's going on than we do?
1888.82 1901.38 speaker4  and I need to kill Gops. We agreed we need that footage.
1900.54 1911.54 speaker2  Yes. I want to human that. Roll it, baby. Nice. 36.
1909.78 1921.78 speaker3  Fuck yeah, baby.
1919.02 1934.98 speaker2  Yeah, are you like a real producer too though?
1931.90 1946.86 speaker4  Well, Ty was my uncle, It was, I mean, I'm lucky that he was my uncle.
1944.62 1956.86 speaker2  Well, we, yeah, we all knew that part. Probably could have clocked that a little sooner,
1954.62 1973.38 speaker4  I have the same kind of heart that you guys do. I want the truth. I want people to know the truth. Well, at least enough truth that they won't, you know, go nuts.
1970.18 1983.22 speaker2  In this case, we just rolled about this.
1981.38 1994.34 speaker3  Julius text.
1990.06 2008.26 speaker4  If that's, you know, that's the easiest way to refer to it. Yeah, she's my roommate. Oh shit.
2006.86 2022.94 speaker2  that wants to remain anonymous. What's her real name? We'll need to get clearance to interview her and everything for this. I don't know that that'll be happening,
2021.34 2027.26 speaker4  She just texted me.
2026.42 2045.22 speaker1  What? Ha ha. Pfft. Pfft. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. And it's all my fault.
2044.38 2046.06 speaker2  That's the end, right?
2045.22 2056.02 speaker3  That's the end. Unfortunately for... We're doing two episodes, so.
2055.18 2062.62 speaker2  Yeah. So it ended down to like 30? 33.
2060.70 2072.22 speaker3  So unfortunately that can't be the end. Yeah, sorry Joe. Ha ha ha.
2069.06 2076.26 speaker4  still like 20 more minutes of episode after.
2075.42 2082.06 speaker3  Yeah.
2080.98 2085.06 speaker2  Not a full fucking song. Nobody would listen to it.
2084.14 2091.22 speaker3  Two seconds.
2090.38 2116.46 speaker4  And he... X? But he texts back a house emoji or Z, question mark. The house. Okay, you guys wanna see my house? What's Z? Secret meeting spot.
2115.62 2129.94 speaker2  It's, well... What are you guys, like an internet discussion group
2128.18 2139.38 speaker4  I'll tell you guys the full story later but I mean, unless you wanna hear it right now. Ha ha ha ha.
2138.54 2143.42 speaker2  Okay. This is perfect.
2141.98 2145.94 speaker3  Where is Jeremy going?
2143.42 2155.14 speaker2  Beck is FaceTiming Julius who is in Jeremy's car following behind us. Or no, we're following them because you've gotta lead us to your house. Who am I in the car with?
2153.38 2160.38 speaker3  You're FaceTiming from Jeremy's car and you're only in the car with Jeremy.
2159.54 2173.18 speaker2  Clark. Beck is getting the... Beck is putting the phone on, like trying to balance it on the dashboard
2170.18 2179.74 speaker1  while he rummages around for like Arby's napkins to start wiping the vomit off of him.
2177.50 2184.34 speaker2  Oh, were you sick?
2182.02 2192.06 speaker1  I poked Julius in his gunshot wound because he didn't think it was a gunshot wound and I was trying to show him it was a gunshot wound
2191.22 2206.26 speaker2  Cal just... Julius says over FaceTime. Cal just kind of blinks
2203.94 2339.66 speaker4  It started when I was in high school and then the screen fades away. Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope. wearing a black and white track and field uniform with the suburb sharks emblazoned on the front. We see clips of him talking and smiling with friends and teammates interspersed between highlights of his sprinting, pole vaulting, high and long jumping. It cuts to Julius on top of a podium wearing multiple gold medals and holding flowers. Julius is surrounded by his friends and fans and being showered with congratulations and praise. The other teens head home with their parents or older siblings. And eventually Julius stands completely alone near the pickup lane at the high school. and asked to use their cell phone. Oh, okay. Yeah, I won. Yeah, okay, I'll just walk home. See you tonight? Julius hands the phone back. Politely declines a ride home and begins to walk the four miles to his mom's house. toward an overgrown path in the woods, a shortcut he's taken a thousand times. About 50 feet onto the trail, Julius hears a twig snap and a low gravelly voice. Nice race. Julius spins around to look at a man in a tight, ratty black suit, dark aviator sunglasses and worn combat boots with thin waist-length pitch black hair rooting for you, You're good.
2338.02 2344.34 speaker2  Let me, let me feel your strength.
2342.98 2353.34 speaker3  Get the fuck away from me!
2351.98 2391.74 speaker4  Julius stares at the man. He notices how unevenly shaved the man's face is. A patch of three or four hairs inches longer than his five o'clock shadow protrudes from his chin. The man raises his hand up to stroke the longer hairs. Five, four, looks over them at Julius and motions his head toward the trail. Go, Mr. Summers. Two. He hurdles over fallen limbs, rusted scrap metal and loose rocks.
2390.86 2395.10 speaker2  One.
2393.58 2414.74 speaker4  begin falling behind him. He can almost see the end of the tree line that opens up into the back of his neighborhood. Julius falls to the ground as he's tackled from behind.
