0.00 45.02 speaker0  Greetings, friends of all shapes and sizes, especially those that are octagonally inclined. This is Wolf from the past, hitting you in the present, so that you can have a brighter future. And the future is always looking bright here on 694.2 PTBP, contentions only time travel and pirate radio show. Squares need not apply, because only the dopest geometry is invited to listen in on this week's Howlin' with Wolf. This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Matt in Singapore, aka at taffysaint, who tweeted
44.02 104.88 speaker1  They write, dulcet-toned broadcast all the way out here in Singapore. that you are there to recap the tragedy on a weekly basis. that escaped my notice. Anyway, impending apocalypse aside, I hope all is well with you. Your broadcasts have inspired me to seek a group of plucky idiots of my own out here
101.52 116.08 speaker0  Well, thanks for writin', Matt in Singapore. All is well with your number one slime puppy, Wolf the dog.
115.08 135.12 speaker1  on ya. Y'all like hentai? I certainly might. But anyway, I'm glad to hear you are takin' up arms with a new crew out of the blue.
127.44 156.40 speaker0  Make sure you get eight hours of sleep, focus on work-life balance, and eat as much trash meat as you can.
152.44 309.36 speaker1  And remember to tell your IRL friends about this show, too. in which we discuss PC creation and fleshed out the town of contention. Speaking of this campaign, what also has a shitload of gas in the tank and isn't slowin' down anytime soon? Ash took off back down the trail to tell Buzz, the ranger from the state, they had found one of the missing persons. Ken Krinklehoff met up with Jeremy after not running into Ash on the trail, and he takes the ranger from state's questions. Judy doused her arms in hand sanitizer and is deeply worried about her mother, Krista Krinklehoff's minivan in the parking lot of the contention woods. Liz tried to, down low, too slow, Woodrow's hand sanitizer squirt and failed, while Shadow decided hand sanitizer would skewer her connection with the earth and the moon and such. The three then saw dripping of blood from the back of Woodrow's neck, staining his shirt. Ash Hornbeam got lost in the woods, saw Tree with a bright light shining from a forearm sized hollow, and avoided a hidden tripwire before sticking his arm right on in that there tree hollow. He seems to have risked his life with this one. He'll have to take on any monsters in the woods single-handedly. You hear that?
307.36 329.36 speaker0  She runs. She runs. She runs.
327.36 357.56 speaker2  She knows. She knows that the time has come to dance beneath the, dance beneath the shadow of the
354.56 365.76 speaker0  I'm just like, uh, dude, did you know that you're bleeding out of your head?
364.76 410.96 speaker2  left it with me. I will give you a roll of persuasion with a plus 40 since you're trading such an enticing
408.96 414.16 speaker0  I'll use it if I want to use it, but thank you.
411.16 415.16 speaker2  If there's any brush in your way, it's likely to be mint there.
414.16 434.16 speaker0  All right. Yeah. I'm going to file that away. Okay.
433.16 444.36 speaker2  All right. So as you patch him up, are you taking a sample of this blood? All right. A three.
443.36 453.36 speaker0  Wow. That's dope. Means good. Yeah. Just kidding. Don't you judge?
452.36 464.36 speaker2  We're an anti-drug podcast. Everybody knows that. For all the 13 year olds and below. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.
463.36 468.36 speaker0  I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.
467.36 476.56 speaker2  I'm just kidding. We're also the ones above 13. Don't do drugs, dads.
474.56 483.56 speaker0  If you're 14, you're in. If you're 14, you're in.
479.56 509.16 speaker2  Dads, wait till your kids are 14 until you start doing drugs again. I'm just like trying to make this about me. So, with all of that taken care of, what are you bringing with you into the woods? Did you bring any camping gear? Were you planning on spending the night or are you just out here to do this and then
508.16 518.36 speaker0  We have some blankets. bag. I have no other thing. And my toothbrush, obviously.
517.36 523.56 speaker2  Obviously. Naturally.
522.56 535.96 speaker0  Notch.
534.66 558.46 speaker2  and useful items. Correct.
557.46 559.46 speaker0  Some bird poop.
558.46 581.36 speaker2  Peat. Yes. Some strained out bird urine. 100%. Yes. Is Judy into gold digging? Is that what a sieve is? I don't know what a sieve is.
577.36 583.96 speaker0  And I'll leave it at that. Okay, so sifter...
582.36 621.76 speaker2  Alright, let's get you guys into the woods. You take everything that you brought with you into the woods, and you head down to a designated camping spot. The camp spots in the Woods of Contention traditionally have wood and a fire pit built up and ready to go for each individual spot to make it easy for anyone who's spending time there to immediately start a fire. However, when you get to yours, you see that there are no rocks surrounding your fire pit. There's plenty of wood. However, no rocks to speak of.
620.56 639.06 speaker0  Judy's very concerned about that.
633.26 660.66 speaker2  like I can be a part of our ritual unless we're all in this together, meaning the earth and the trees and the sky and the moon. And Judy, what is Judy doing? Just staring at where rocks were?
655.06 737.26 speaker0  Yeah, Judy's just desperately looking for something to cling to as far as emotion. She's really terrified already. She's coming to grips with the fact that she's going to be out in the dark. Yeah, Liz is gone. So yeah, Judy's just standing around looking for comfort. Maybe in a pond somewhere that is nice? That's so stupid. me think that my mom is out here. Someone definitely stole her car like Elizabeth said. Anything you say is right and always.
731.96 738.26 speaker2  So first, I am going to request a sanity roll.
737.26 740.40 speaker0  First one.
739.26 751.36 speaker2  You've played D&D before. You ain't rolled a sanity check. Oh, fuck. What'd you roll? That's a pass.
750.36 752.36 speaker0  I rolled an eight.
751.36 786.76 speaker2  Yes. Under your sanity, which your sanity is? the world around you begins to kind of warp and change. You were just looking through these woods for rocks and you could not find any and then all of a sudden you are seemingly standing in a different spot in the woods.
785.76 790.48 speaker0  Oh, congratulations.
787.76 882.16 speaker2  So you're going to find a couple of things. So you turn back and you don't recognize the path that you just took to walk out here, but looking forward, you do see a few rocks, big rocks, and next to them, even bigger rocks. And you see there's an extremely fit man in his mid 40s and he is bald and he has a super And he is walking around in circles with his hands just like waving all about and he seems to be like talking to himself. toes into the dirt beneath trying to become a moon baby. A maybe. Is what it's called. If you won't. And as that happens, I need you to roll a sanity check at a negative 40.
881.16 887.96 speaker0  What is your sanity? My sanity is at a 40. Oh, right.
885.08 894.40 speaker2  So if you roll a zero zero one, that would be a success. But if your dice match, then it'll be a critical failure.
893.40 900.12 speaker0  I rolled a 98.
899.00 1042.92 speaker2  So that's terrible. And you failed miserably. Cool. I'm going to need you to roll a D six, which is the normal die in order to see how much sanity you lose. Okay. You're going to go batshit crazy. So when you lose five or more sanity in one go, you automatically will have a bout of insanity is how we're going to play it for this little story. That means that you will either have a faint, flight, or flight. Did I say flight twice? Who knows? Flight, fight, or faint are the three options for your character. So let's rank them in most to least likely for Judy. Faint. So if you roll a one, two, or three on the D six, then Judy will faint. And what would be the second most likely flight that makes sense. So if you roll four or five, she'll run away. And then if you roll a six, she will get extremely aggressive. So Judy is going to freak out and take off running, but you look over and you see shadow swaying and her swaying begins to become one with the trees behind her and the trees are swaying and then the ground starts moving from underneath you and you lose touch with your own sense of direction and the sky above you turns into the ground and everything is upside down and the ground underneath you is above you in the sky and your feet are on top of your head playing patty cake with your hands and you cannot tell what is reality and you need to get away from this place. So won't Taylor come back in?
1041.92 1045.92 speaker0  Yeah. Mm hmm.
1044.92 1056.88 speaker2  That's a term I made up and I knew it already. Everyone knew it. Duh. You look over and you see Judy and Judy doesn't look like Judy. Like her normal. Judy.
1055.88 1082.72 speaker0  Hi. How are you doing? Don't talk to me. How long have you been a tree? powerful too. So I'll take it. Stop talking to me. Oh my God. I can't do this anymore. I have to go right now. Oh my God. I have to run to safety. Wait. Where is safety? I don't know.
1081.24 1086.48 speaker2  I sigh heavily.
1085.48 1099.04 speaker0  Just give me a minute. I grab the machete and I run after her. So she's wearing those as she's running off. Oh it's in her pocket.
1098.04 1103.04 speaker2  In her hand. Oh and cute.
1100.04 1124.26 speaker0  It's a zip up pocket so it'll stay in no matter what.
1120.24 1131.48 speaker2  You were talking to Judy and she called you a tree. If you were a tree what kind of tree would you be?
1130.48 1141.16 speaker0  Wow. Tree form. All mixed together.
1139.16 1148.26 speaker2  What do you do when Judy just takes off running?
1144.52 1164.38 speaker0  I'm also up for a little bit of adventure in the night. I just sort of assume that like the forest will take us where it wants to take us.
1163.24 1170.76 speaker2  you just walking? How are you doing about this?
1168.80 1209.56 speaker0  I'm definitely not walking. I'm kind of I'm like leaping through the forest. And I have like these attached veils they attach to my thumb and they're almost like these wings but just of like meshy material. What? So when I leap through it's almost like I'm a dancer but they kind of like float like
1208.56 1241.40 speaker2  Yes. Liz is standing at a bit of a clearing here and she's looking at these big rocks and in between a nice cleavage of rocks you have seen this man who is waving his arms about and talking to himself and he is bald and has some scruff and a big jawline seems to
1236.80 1243.36 speaker0  49 on a 50.
1241.40 1282.84 speaker2  Congratulations. The first thing you are going to see is that the trees directly in the area that seemed to be making a circle around this clearing all have a very specific sigil carved into them. It is like a single line with three lines coming off the top and two lines coming off the bottom and it looks like kind of a like a branch of some sort and you would also notice inside the clearing where this man is he is surrounded in a circle of a white substance.
1278.40 1283.84 speaker0  Are we talking like coke or like liquid white?
1282.84 1311.36 speaker2  Not liquid. All right. I know we were both thinking milk but it is a powder of some sort so that is what you see. You do think as Liz.
1310.36 1330.12 speaker0  with any of it. Okay all right I'm ready I'm rolling for stealth.
1328.20 1356.80 speaker2  That is a fail. That is a fail and so you are staring at him and then you take a step backward and just crunch down on a big old stick, crack! And it echoes throughout this little clearing that he's in and he immediately looks over makes direct eye contact with you and he's waving you forward and he wants you to he
1352.92 1381.92 speaker0  wants you to join him and he's like oh you gotta get around from over there you know All right Liz finds this guy attractive so I mean he's talking to me now I'm gonna go
1376.24 1454.96 speaker2  he's like oh hey if we're gonna stop before you touch on it if you don't you step right since then you gotta keep safe gotta keep safe there's nothing about the fish out here us then it's safe so. Oh fuck. a bit of a perimeter so if you stay here with me you're gonna be safe but if you leave it's over. And he walks back towards his campsite and you see on the back of his neck he has a tattoo and it is like a stylized H so the two sides are kind of like curved in so it'd be like a backwards C and then a normal C with a line going through the middle of them.
1452.72 1481.80 speaker0  Is his camp like within the circle of this white powder? Yeah I mean it's marked out so.
1480.80 1501.04 speaker2  So how do you feel about it? On a 30 so that is a fail yes and how do you personally Lindsay outside of the game feel about this character?
1495.20 1504.04 speaker0  there's a strange man he's attractive so there's like 10% 10% wanting I want to trust him.
1503.04 1550.52 speaker2  Yeah but I don't. Attractive people do have it easier in life just in general true it is a privilege especially have to stay here it's nightfall at this point and if you leave you'd absolutely get in thought so there's there's no way around here you know it's got to be with the fishes and we've got to keep it left right upside down sideways I mean your feet might be where
1549.20 1555.56 speaker0  and do that what do I roll for?
1550.52 1642.16 speaker2  You don't have to roll anything he's gonna call after you and he's just like oh no no you got oh god damn you gotta fucking get got there's not a chance that you're not gonna you're not dead you're still alive you're just lost okay as Liz Lonklin is walking through the woods desperately trying to find her campsite she loses track of where she is and the sun
1634.64 1661.60 speaker3  light you can also as you get closer about an inch of my skin below my elbow is completely
1655.08 1705.52 speaker2  127 hours when James Franco like cuts his nerve didn't watch it yeah that was hard to watch shits
1699.96 1789.08 speaker3  camping trip but I kind of got lost I don't something really weird happened I don't know arm in here and I was lost and I saw this tree and there's a hole in it with light coming out and I I just stuck my arm in it and now it's stuck and it hurts really bad and I don't I drop my axe back at the campsite so I don't really have anything to get out of here with do you have any was a crazy naked man that was all cut up and we tied him up and he also couldn't talk and he tried but my main priority right now is to get out of this fucking tree and I pull my arm about half an
1781.96 1960.72 speaker2  of your skin are completely gone and blood begins running down your elbow and dripping onto the and looking down right where you were about to step mm-hmm there is a wire that is running across roll a sanity check for me both of you because you do not know how to get out of the situation enough to wear a little fun rule about this game is that when you lose sanity the handler can make yourself and you pull your arm out another like three inches and you lose three hit points putting
1956.32 1984.80 speaker0  help help I start like running away I'm looking for somebody I'm gonna leave them cuz I can't do
1979.72 2013.08 speaker3  it like in shock like look off I've started to say something to Liz but she's gone I'm out
2006.16 2178.36 speaker2  it no mind as the world around her is melting and contorting and convulsing all at the same time the earth seems to be pulsating but the ground is the sky and you have no idea what's going on so I'm need to roll a 30 or under in order to pass this alertness check go and roll those dice for me I you stop dead in your tracks because right in front of you is very clearly a pile of leaves that is wholly suspicious as if beneath it lies some sort of trap but Judy notices this and stops burst onto the scene Ally I want you to roll dexterity and because you crit earlier there's no chance you'll fall into the leaves so you're just rolling to grab shadow and throw her off her in a very whimsical manner and you see her just in time to grab her and pull her to the edge and the two of you fall and hit the ground and as you do that one of your arms flings out and hits this pile of leaves and immediately the entire pile falls and you look down and you see that there
2169.56 2255.36 speaker0  maybe fate could take us together down that hole um shadow I am really trying to lose trust in you right now because first you turn into a tree and then you chase me through the trees and try to
2249.48 2266.84 speaker2  swoop down and like slowly flap their wings as we danced behind them shadow like knew which birds were like closest to her campsite earlier so you could listen for those bird sounds as
2261.92 2352.52 speaker0  opposed to earlier one well okay when I think of bird calling I think of like bird communicating five bird friends so I would like to use my bird calling and my very accurate and reasonable explanation is that I noticed that there were a line of oak trees right by our campsite and I happen to know that there is a regional canary by the name of Churchill that's its bird species of course yeah and it only nests in oak trees of that age and so I'm listening and right now it's
2346.00 2379.44 speaker2  sitting on a log that is around the fire like a person might just like cross-legged and it is using its tiny little fingers to eat food any food that you guys might have brought with you
2364.92 2403.80 speaker0  Oh shadow what is that trash panda that you said um he our good friend really pretty friend Liz
2397.16 2440.64 speaker2  raccoon it makes eye contact with you and it immediately perks up puts the food down looks at you and then runs over to your bag and starts like throwing shit out of your bags and it's
2436.40 2479.20 speaker0  gonna take off my jacket and I'm gonna walk over there and I'm gonna try to like jump on it and right now so she has taken her arms put them inside the sleeves of her onesie that she's wearing in the head crouched down and is just sitting there rocking back and forth saying Liz's
2472.44 2524.24 speaker2  raccoon succeeds as you attempt to throw your jacket over on top of it it dodges nimbly out of the way and it is holding a bottle of hand sanitizer that I believe Judy brought with her you guys grabbed the hand sanitizer from yeah and the raccoon is holding it and it points at the hand sanitizer and then it like does a thumb underneath its chin and swipes across like cut throat and then it like throws the hand sanitizer on the ground and backs away from it and puts its
2514.28 2553.92 speaker0  sanitizer maybe half the bottle on my body but I didn't eat it or anything so I probably am fine or am I gonna die maybe we should use the water canteen and you should take off all your clothes
2546.96 2655.48 speaker2  you a thumbs up and then motions back down the trail toward the trailhead with its thumb go Judy you were looking at this raccoon and you do not see a raccoon Taylor go ahead and take your headphones off and plug your ears for me and just wiggle your fingers around in your ears don't get in fact she's already not listening so Ally Judy sees this raccoon and looking in its eyes you see
2647.64 2721.92 speaker0  animal and that I could trust Judy I know you've really been through a lot and I'm just not sure I can trust your judgment right now but lucky for you I really like that little raccoon because he reminds me of my mother or so let's go I like jump up I'm still like cradling my own body at
2712.20 2941.60 speaker2  the trail and you come to a spot where you can hear some people talking and as you're walking up down it is almost pure darkness and at that point it's a clear sky and the only thing you'll be able to see by is moonlight and you know that and time is running out and you are freaking the fuck out but as you make your way back to the trail you finally find it and as soon as you do you see a campsite just off to the right in which you see Jeremy Pettymore and can clink it crinkle crinkle by name as the whole Pettymore clan is just a full big old family of rust abouts and and there do wells and can clinkle ha fuck me you can call me whatever you want it's crinkle ha can crinkle ha is a freshman as well at Silas Cole K through 12 and he is the star sport athlete at Silas Cole K through 12 he is the future of this school the two of you would know that Liz lonklin is a total badass always wearing her Doc Martens always disrespecting anyone who steps to her and as the two of you are trying to calm each other down essentially well more so Jeremy is trying to calm down Ken as you're talking to this man who is cut up and bloody and muddy and almost feral but you're you're treating him with some with some nice little winkies and Liz you see this
2934.80 2957.80 speaker4  just out here kind of screaming and you know acting a fool so ash wrestled him into the ground and I I tied him up but then he it just seems like a little some kind of dog man so I was gonna give
2953.08 2978.80 speaker0  friend it ashes over there stuck in a tree you know that right no he took in a tree ash is stuck
2971.96 3054.12 speaker4  this fella here cuz he's one of the 18 missing peoples in them in these woods where what kind keeps it up keeps it up wherever he gets could you show us where he is can you can you take me will hurt us if you let him free can eat he didn't see what a sorry state he was in he's
3049.00 3076.64 speaker0  I can can we like just keep them tied up and like take them with us tied up that's right yeah you
3071.88 3113.72 speaker4  Rangers where to find him it'd be easy peasy he's survived out here long enough apparently dammit Ken sometimes you have to do what's right and not what's gonna look good to a college admissions board well all right I know associated with wild men ain't the kind of thing that you want to be seen around cuz you're you're some kind of fucking you know achiever now and you're better than the rest of us but once you was down in the muck covered in in scratches just like rusty here I
3109.40 3128.12 speaker0  was telling me that if I leave by myself something will get me so I don't want to leave this guy by
3121.32 3177.92 speaker2  fell and I put I put one in there and he immediately just like holds it with fingers of both
3172.92 3476.44 speaker4  he was snarling and gnashing and and there was just there was something in his eyes I could tell show me where ash is he can do whatever he wants with this guy I just I gotta get away from here
3472.16 3519.84 speaker0  yeah she has never oh she does have her toothbrush toothpaste in her toothbrush but she's still
3513.84 3565.16 speaker2  the Ranger sits and you see all the cars in the parking lot all of the same cars are still these
3558.28 3611.04 speaker0  some of it to brush my teeth we should probably go up there and find her mom mom wait wait wait
3604.40 3657.96 speaker2  see as you turn the corner that Krista Krinklehoff is poking her head out the little window of the a thing of hand sanitizer from behind the bar if you will and puts it up on the little shelf the little little ledge of the shack everyone should be washing their hands as opposed to you know getting all higgledy-piggledy or anything else like you you must use hand sanitizer and not you
3653.20 3682.32 speaker0  when Judy sees a bottle of hand sanitizer she runs to it and puts it in her hands she's already
3676.24 3819.36 speaker2  got a four which if we play prices right rules so the highest number wins as long as you stay under your staff so you fight this raccoon off to get some hand sanitizer and you put a bunch understand why what it is that uh brought made you bring a raccoon with you back out into the me to watch his stead for the time being because he heard that there were some some folks out there just wobbling jaws and and and he was afraid that they might you know get their barking irons out and take care of business and we can't have anyone shooting guns and making mayhem out here in the
3813.48 3862.44 speaker0  into the woods right now I just want to stay with the raccoon probably you could go maybe alone Judy I'm not sure that anyone could comfort Liz the way that you can you know about your
3855.44 3876.00 speaker2  you should go back into the woods and grab Liz I will wait here and Judy you can wait here with
3869.60 3935.08 speaker0  very comfortable and one with everything in nature I'm a little confused as to why you the mother of my best friend would want me to go back into the woods by myself where several people have
3929.44 4097.08 speaker2  Ranger comes back if you could stay here and the raccoon friend I suppose can can stay here as together even though your vision is starting to blur you're still going to lose one sanity okay but that is just going to make the world around you slowly it's as if it's going to turn the way it did earlier but it doesn't quite make it fully you just see your vision is rippling and the raccoon is walking back from around the side of the building and it looks at you with these dead leads you to the small restroom attached to this Rangers welcome shack and as you approach the heavy metal door the Sun finally finishes its shift from the inside of this trailhead restroom we see the scratched up brown door open and Judy Krinklehoff is backlit only by the single flickering light illuminating the contention woods parking area I'm gonna need a sanity check here
4091.84 4116.24 speaker0  hands are shaking a little bit and she's breathing a little heavy but she doesn't want to run she's
4103.76 4172.72 speaker2  dead stare from her eyes we see the body of Ed buzz Woodrow still in his state ranger uniform but his limp body is on the dirty bathroom floor and it's been folded neatly like a freshly pressed
4156.36 4172.72 speaker5  She knows that the time has come to dance beneath the dance beneath the shadow of the moon. Her eyes have seen it all. The wonders of the wonders of the shadow of the moon.
