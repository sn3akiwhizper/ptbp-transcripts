0.00 15.16 speaker0  Greetings, friends. It's your BFF, WTD. BFF means beefy, funny friend.
10.16 197.40 speaker1  And a WTD means wet-tongued doggy. You're welcome. TTYL, time to yell loudly. and that makes my nasty old heart always burst with love. This howlin' with Wolf is from Distant Egg Song, location, Houston, they write. Thanks much to the trash slurpin' host with the most. Always glad to hear your voice on the airwaves. This goes out to Tamantha in St. Louis. Hey, Vinnie, glad you turned me on to this podcast. It made my 2020 better. Regarding your question, I checked in Ma's recipe book. The way to render the sacrificial, purulent goo from a gamer's flesh is to go low and slow for a minimum of eight hours. Glad to see you and Vinnie and Galina. Your brother from the Venuccia mother, Vinnie. Mmm, damn, that recipe sounds abso-fuckin'-lutely tasty, scrumptious, unctuous. I must visit this all-mother and exchange my forbidden recipes with them. If you wanna write up somethin' you can go fuck yourself. Ha ha ha, I'm just kiddin'. Fuck Mark Zuckerberg, I got some hot news. I have it on good authority that this here is the second of two Q&A sessions to wrap up season one of somethin'. that next Friday on November 5th, ha ha, shucks, for real, am I gonna have to say some corny, stankin', remember, remember nonsense? V might be for vendetta to some folks, but to me, V is for volumizing shampoo and conditioners. we will have a guest seated at the head of the table. You might know him as the rules lawyer on the Glass Cannon Network star finder program Androids and Aliens. And if you don't, you'll get to know David Winters as the handler of pretending to be people for the next five weeks as he runs Joe, Luke, Thomas, and some idiot named Zack through a classic Delta Green scenario. Get ready for an absolute mess, y'all. And finally, get ready for ol' Wolfie to be an absolute mess. It's time to say goodbye to a brand new song. This premiere will be the last time I play it here on the main feed of 694.2 PTBP.
195.24 205.28 speaker0  of a banger ever again,
200.76 241.28 speaker1  One of which is just Google cuts you with no backbone.
238.04 251.56 speaker2  Oh yeah, did you see the article came out today or just the story of Chokin'? No. Yeah, Chokin' on Deez Nuts.
250.72 255.48 speaker3  He didn't say Chokin'. He didn't say it.
254.64 264.90 speaker0  I got you. Yeah, I got you to say it.
263.84 266.88 speaker3  Reverse got him.
266.04 267.70 speaker2  I got got.
266.88 311.08 speaker3  Thanks, Joe. was telling me that like a lot of people she works with no longer use Photoshop. They use a program called Figma. Because it's not a person I could say Figma balls to. You know what? And this time took a long time for y'all to find out.
309.80 315.80 speaker2  I have a bad story first. You want to hear it? I do want to hear it. Let's fuck around.
313.58 321.16 speaker3  Let's fuck around.
318.08 325.48 speaker2  I forgot that I had stabbed my hand with a steak knife
324.64 336.08 speaker3  Oh, wow. Shit. Wait, I didn't see it.
335.24 338.04 speaker2  Hold it over to the screen.
336.08 339.36 speaker3  It's like, Zach doesn't know how to use Windows.
338.04 392.68 speaker2  Yeah, oh. It doesn't look that bad. It's deep. I was trying to split two hash browns apart that were frozen with a steak knife. And I literally went, I shouldn't be doing this. Like without much pressure at all. And I just like stabbed into my hand and I just was like, oh man. Oh, it was an afternoon, yeah. So you were drinking for a few hours at that point. So this is, you woke up and this was like
390.92 396.80 speaker3  a midnight snack, almost.
394.04 418.20 speaker2  And yeah, and luckily I was okay, Cause if you've ever like sliced chicken, where it like kind of the muscle kind of split, I did a little bit of that, which was very fun to look at. And I was like, oh man, that's bad. You guys make chicken different than I do.
416.32 423.96 speaker3  You might not have seen the inside of your hand. It's chickeny. Oh.
421.24 429.88 speaker2  Have you ever seen the inside of your body?
427.70 435.86 speaker3  I suppose I've seen the inside of my body. Technically, yeah.
434.04 442.72 speaker2  Yeah, I do want it. I'm Zach's second opinion. That looks, doesn't look normal.
441.88 471.86 speaker3  Pollip. It's a pollip. but it's clearly shit. You can see the corn. Yeah, that's a pollip. Wake him up, tell him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You gotta wake him up because they put you in a daze. It's a real a pollip of daisy. Oh my God.
471.04 477.24 speaker2  Do we have any questions? All of them.
474.54 487.68 speaker3  The bollard asks, what the fuck? Fuck you too. Yeah, that was my first question to you.
486.76 491.00 speaker0  To what we've done.
490.16 495.16 speaker3  Oh yeah. I think that's what I said. I think that is what you said at the end of season one.
493.84 509.80 speaker2  The fuck? I mean, it's just a small town mystery.
508.04 512.92 speaker3  of Wolf the dog?
512.08 516.84 speaker2  There's a little bit.
514.24 528.76 speaker3  If you can, if you're, you know. If you're smart. all of Wolf the dog is in there. So go back, re-listen, get those numbers up. Definitely re-listen and get those numbers up.
525.92 555.96 speaker2  Actually, at the Patreon $100 tier, I will call you on Discord and tell you. You have to be subscribed for two years. It's patreon.com slash Justin wants money.
550.96 559.20 speaker3  you can see at least the story of Wolf the dog.
556.84 561.04 speaker2  Yeah, there's some slight origin story in there.
559.20 577.40 speaker3  That's how he comes into the studio. and I don't know why it needs to be any more than that. Yup. To do hakenu to you as well, son.
575.28 579.68 speaker2  To do hakenu are true words of power,
577.44 583.72 speaker3  but how did you come up with vis-a-girl and shuck-a-tee-felicia? Asked and answered.
582.88 585.04 speaker2  Asked and answered.
583.72 606.16 speaker3  We went over this one last time, but hey, Celery Top, we like what you do. You've done some sick art. Exactly, pasted it again in the Google document. which is fucking rad, yeah. Abadfeeling asks, question, what was up with the feet eating?
604.96 619.60 speaker2  I'm curious about that too. No, I was gonna ask you, Joe, if you had an idea. My only theory, and I don't know if these guys know this yet, that was how I was introduced to that light plane world You can say it.
618.24 623.12 speaker3  It was a jagant umbropithecus.
619.60 638.64 speaker2  It was a xenonimatoh that they attached to my foot to send me there. And so I assume it's maybe covering up evidence of those scars on, he kept mentioning that scar on my foot. I assume it was maybe covering that up in some way, but I wasn't sure why they needed to consume it. I didn't know what was up with that.
637.80 703.68 speaker3  All right. And I mean, did you have a reason at the time beyond it's real spooky? Yes, it was simply what Joe said, that it is a thing that shows that you have been at the circle of knowledge. And if you were a Delta Green agent and you were like cleaning up after like a mission or something, and one of the parts of the mission was that certain people had this crazy scar on the bottom of their left foot, then yeah, you'd cut it off and- Feed it to them. Like you do. Okay, but Chief Maggie Cook had some serious issues with James the Mill Worker specifically, because James the Mill Worker clearly had issues with Chief Maggie Cook and his own blood, if you would have tested the blood at his house that spelled out stop her, that was James the Mill Worker's blood because he knew that Chief Maggie Cook was going down this dark path. at the contention police station? Yeah. Drew Andrews is a- Vampire.
700.82 704.52 speaker2  He's a vampire and you just give him a little blood.
703.68 714.60 speaker3  I forgot about it. He licks it. He laps it up. And then he goes, and then he blows blood.
712.08 725.44 speaker2  James the Mill Worker's blood. We kept forgetting to take advantage of that.
722.56 742.28 speaker3  the various theme songs for the show's various arcs strike me as something very cool this show does Will this continue in season two? Yes. Any bangers picked out yet? No bangers. No bangers picked out.
740.92 762.70 speaker2  Circling some? We're circling. We're circling. Springfield bands that we're into, yeah. Connected to the region at the least, yeah.
761.78 777.34 speaker3  For sure. Justin and I were in a band and we played with Blue False Indigo and that's kind of how we met them
775.58 784.86 speaker2  We played with Dream Girl and Kudzu before too.
783.18 848.26 speaker3  that we've used a couple of times on the show called No Backbone, the lead singer of that band is a very good promoter in Springfield who always makes sure that bands coming through are well taken care of, that they have a good place to sleep and that they get paid. So we were happy to promote Kudzu, yeah, which No Backbone's a fucking banger. The rest of the songs, I mean, we've got Someone Still Loves You, Boris Yeltsin, who's just a fucking staple of the Springfield scene. We've all seen them countless times, I would imagine. More than any other band. And then who else do we have? Grady P. Drug, who is just an excellent musician. We saw him a couple of weekends ago actually and he was phenomenal. A Dragon in Three, which is an offshoot of Someone Still Loves You, Boris Yeltsin, yeah. And they are an incredible little outfit And I'm looking forward to new music from them, hopefully.
846.34 854.86 speaker2  Creek Rocks are some friends of mine and they've got a residency right now down in Silver Dollar City. Oh, no shit.
853.38 856.82 speaker3  That's super rad.
855.98 862.62 speaker2  as the weather changes.
861.08 876.10 speaker3  We've been really happy, I think, with all the songs that we've been able to play. Do they have any pants left? To throw on the show. Wow, that is a deep cut from Luke talking about... There's a ride at Silver Dollar City called Fire in the Hole.
874.02 880.82 speaker2  Oh, yes, I should have got it. God dang it.
879.50 891.86 speaker3  Luke, do you want to describe? Yeah, it's called, did you say what it's called? It's called Fire in the Hole.
890.66 897.50 speaker2  with like a prison escape or something? Oh, yeah. It's a town on fire.
894.62 916.94 speaker3  And the town is lit on fire by the... Bald Knobbers. Bald Knobbers. Why is that, Luke? Oh, because at one point in the ride you see a home. A home that is on fire.
915.02 919.70 speaker2  That's on fire and one of the guys is getting out of the home.
918.58 926.78 speaker3  He's hanging out the window. And she says... And he's wearing his long underwear. His nighttime clothes.
924.38 945.98 speaker2  And she says, whatever your name is, it's whatever his name is. I can't put on my pants. The dang Bald Knobbers stole them.
944.66 960.18 speaker3  We're trying to get local work. And blank a patch, shout out to blank a patch from NerdPoker.
959.34 965.66 speaker2  We answered it, good.
964.38 972.30 speaker3  Oh, that's, thanks. Congratulations on excellent work across two continents. Thank you. Thank you.
970.96 981.46 speaker2  It was across three at one point, which I was super proud of when we had Scott Dorward playing with us. I bragged about that to people in my life that we were playing a game across three continents.
980.62 983.12 speaker0  That was cool.
982.28 1076.94 speaker3  That was rad. So were the time loops and resets always part of your story? We're the coolest people who do this. No. after the characters got into impossible situations? Yes. Also, how... Hold on, hold on, hold on. Did the characters get into impossible situations Yes, also yes. Very much yes. It was my doing that I had opened up the story And I thought to myself, how will I take them down these avenues? And then I thought, well... Time travel, the greatest cop out of them all. that I can play with who might be able to do some stuff. Yeah, fucking nightmare, honestly. this community contributed to going? Fantastic question. It's going really well. Frankie and, no, no, no, no, no, no, hang on, have compiled everything that everyone has written and voted on up into one document and it is slowly being whittled down into a playable game. And it'll be out in, oh, what, 2031. Yeah. It'll be playable.
1075.38 1092.66 speaker2  Let's not put it that close. Okay, yeah. 2053.
1088.82 1102.24 speaker3  And if these guys have forgotten enough of what they might've read from what people wrote about that campaign, I would definitely be interested in running some form of that.
1100.94 1113.28 speaker2  I purposely didn't read a lot of it because I thought we played it at some point.
1110.06 1115.42 speaker3  maybe even just using parts of it to create a one-shot. What's up, Thomas?
1114.12 1127.82 speaker2  This is the first time I've even heard of it. Oh, right, perfect. I knew about it.
1126.22 1156.46 speaker3  thanks for doing such great work. Hey, thanks. Honestly, it's been great just listening to you guys improv together. I felt like I've learned a lot about how to keep the jokes rolling in my own life Sit you on a bad path. Dangerous ground. Yeah, you're on thin ice, my friend. And let me tell you, you better walk back right now for the sake of your relationships.
1155.62 1163.94 speaker2  And your career. We don't do this. Right. Yeah, all six of us have,
1161.62 1252.34 speaker3  or there's five of us, I have no, no. Like, I was like, well, wait, I have tons of people that I like and that I'll talk to in public. And did you have any fears going in? Probably, for sure. Yeah, you've been wanting to do it for a while But we also, we were all listening to a bunch of role-playing podcasts. And when I listened to a lot of music, I thought I could play music. And when I listened to a lot of actual play podcasts, We're like, why not record it? Yeah, it was enough to where when I brought it up, no one balked at the idea, except for Taylor, Yeah. We felt good. We all felt good playing together
1249.86 1255.18 speaker2  and we thought it might translate.
1252.34 1275.22 speaker3  We honestly didn't expect this. Thomas is shaking his head like I did. don't put a nod in his mouth. Ooh. Did you guys, you guys didn't have any fears? No, I didn't.
1273.86 1280.58 speaker2  Going in, I definitely did.
1278.18 1293.02 speaker3  Do you guys have any fears now? Oh yeah, there's so much more to lose. One fear.
1291.02 1298.46 speaker2  and we finally found that we were just playing at a table together, my fears were allayed. I remember that we have fun doing it either way.
1297.62 1301.98 speaker3  That's right. Exactly.
1301.14 1305.22 speaker2  Yes.
1303.22 1309.94 speaker3  So that was on that stream the other night. The stream the other night, yeah, yeah.
1306.78 1317.54 speaker2  But we, yeah, because we did record so many episodes
1312.98 1328.42 speaker3  to just put the game we were playing on the air. We were very comfortable with what we were doing at that point because it was just the same thing we'd always done, kind of. Yeah.
1326.30 1335.86 speaker2  like that is to build up a little bit and then start releasing it so you're not scared
1335.02 1338.86 speaker0  It's like edging.
1337.42 1353.94 speaker2  It's the only way.
1351.46 1383.14 speaker3  If you start fucking me, you better make me cum. She went on Punch Up the Jam and she punched up the jam. She was on it. Bruno Nunez asks, what was the balloon shaped head kid from the JLP the Third Flashback? I mentioned a balloon shaped headed kid multiple times. He had very dark eyes. Who was it, Joe?
1380.90 1419.26 speaker2  It was Pastor Adam Kane as a child. When we were listening to the episodes in real time and I got to my flashback, I had already played at that point a scene with Pastor Adam Kane and he described him exactly the same way. And I texted Zach, you son of a bitch. I know who the balloon head kid is. Did you have a flashback with him or was that just a mistake on their part?
1415.58 1452.90 speaker3  John Lee Pettymore the Third, burning down the Kane home. he saw his dad rescue him is one way of saying it. Steal him and burn down the house of his family is another way of saying it. or will he be banished back into the pit from whence he came until another uncle PC is introduced?
1451.18 1464.62 speaker0  Zach said I can't come out of the pit.
1461.42 1472.22 speaker2  my schedule is going to be so freaking wacky with grad school crap, especially when we're going to start recording it.
1470.26 1480.94 speaker3  He already makes all the music. You guys asked too much from him.
1479.74 1485.46 speaker0  Zach's down there with me digging it.
1482.82 1491.98 speaker3  and he's like, ah, you want to finish, don't you?
1488.70 1497.26 speaker2  would for me right now would be just a little bit too much. Even though I've had a blast.
1495.14 1532.78 speaker3  If you do all my assignments, you'll finally earn your Zachster's degree one of these days. Alexia says, I love this format where I can just immediately Alexia says, thank you for making this amazing show. Thanks. Thanks. Question, how do you manage to find so many amazing bands local to you? Well, it all dates back to the Ozarks Jubilee.
1532.10 1534.38 speaker0  It's also true.
1532.78 1563.90 speaker2  It has a really cool musical history. And it's just been full of musical talent. We've had a burgeoning musical scene forever. And exactly, it does go back to the Jubilee. I saw this question earlier on. And I wanted to plug, there's a documentary out there right now. You can find it on thecenterofnowhere.com. And it's kind of about the history of Springfield music. It used to be on Amazon. But I think they had some weird thing where they took a bunch of documentaries down. But you can find it on that website. They want to silence the truth of the Springfield music scene.
1562.10 1569.34 speaker0  Well, I also think, I don't know.
1567.38 1579.76 speaker2  Because your parents do music stuff. And mine do. And Joe's do also. Yeah. My parents tried to make it. They put out a cassette.
1576.00 1602.40 speaker3  And they moved to Nashville before they had kids. And put out a Christian cassette tape. But neither one of them have Grammys. Switchfoot. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
1601.04 1603.74 speaker0  He's like, my dad's a good old.
1602.40 1613.48 speaker2  I was like, you have to explain. He's a good, good piano player. He's a really good piano player. Or it was a folk album of the year, I believe it was.
1611.04 1623.04 speaker0  We should make our dads do a battle of the pianos against each other. My dad would kick your dad's ass.
1621.04 1642.60 speaker3  He has a degree in composition. Music composition. What has he composed? Yeah. A cassette tape? Yeah. Yeah. Moving on, we found so many amazing local bands because there's so many amazing local bands around.
1640.64 1643.20 speaker2  We've got an embarrassment of riches around us.
1642.60 1648.04 speaker3  We really do. And also, throw yourself into the music scene
1646.76 1650.20 speaker2  Because it's probably got good music.
1648.04 1702.36 speaker3  Yeah, I'm sure you're going to find something that you like. Also, it's really easy for people to record music these days. And so more people are making it. Every time the boys woke up back in the cemetery, was there another group of them running around in the same city? Or was that an alternate timeline? Yes. Alternate universe. Yes kind of thing. So A, yes, there was an alternate version of them in that scenario. But in, for instance, the iteration where you guys went to the Glass Family Compound, that world continues on and keeps doing its own thing. The next time you come back, you're in a different iteration of that same plane. But you've done what you did previously before. Does that make sense?
1698.88 1705.32 speaker2  Yeah, I do get that sort of, so our guys are doing it?
1704.28 1780.50 speaker3  there's only one of you. In the second one that you woke up in, there's two of you in that world. In the third one you woke up in, there's three of you in that world. four of you in that collective universe. Well, there's not because you died in the CSU arc. We got another question here. What up with the names branded into their skin when they wake up at the cemetery? Was it an overseer hint on where they need to go next? Yes. Or was it something more than that? It was simply that when you interact your group will have that name crossed out. The next time you wake up and you only have until all your names are crossed out, then you have one last time to go through it. So first time you had one name crossed out. Second time you had the second name crossed out. Third time you ran into both Tildy B. Mitchell because Keith ran into Tildy B. Mitchell, Andrew Andrews, and therefore crossed out both of those names, giving you only one more chance at life. Thank goodness.
1779.38 1785.14 speaker2  you need to talk to these guys. But he was just hoping that you would figure out what you needed from him. Yes.
1783.62 1789.74 speaker3  Yeah, that was his.
1788.66 1796.94 speaker2  Good, good, good, good. That's what I was hoping.
1795.46 1875.90 speaker3  I love the way, this is long. I love the way you created horror by constantly throwing new mysteries and problems and gross shit into the plot. Instead of being scary because of slowly built tension, it was scary from being completely overwhelming, like it was a mental breakdown. It was. Yeah, very cool inversion. I love that you wrote a time travel plot and still held characters and plot elements so loosely and let unexpected things happen. Yeah, that was really fucking hard. I loved how great everyone was at instantly bringing each new character to life. That's just good for you guys. Thank you. I love the way the players play like they are horror movie characters. Yes, again, thank you that I agree with that. Thank you for doing it. I thought it was great that no matter how tangled everything got, it always felt like there was an explanation for everything. If we could just understand. I mean, your trust means everything to me. I love that when the players were given complete freedom in the final episodes, they kept topping, lol, lol, each unbelievably cool thing they did with another unbelievably cool thing.
1875.06 1878.66 speaker4  Thank you, yeah.
1877.14 1887.22 speaker2  We all kind of felt like our power is unlocked.
1883.70 1894.78 speaker3  So they're saying, having done such cool stuff, what was the one thing you wish you had done differently as your character?
1893.06 1907.34 speaker2  but I would have been super curious how the whole thing would have gone if I'd gone with Leon. That really was a fork in the road that could have drastically changed the way this whole thing went.
1905.66 1912.38 speaker4  I would want to see what happened then.
1911.54 1938.98 speaker3  So you would have- with Jon, probably a lot, but Jon does know as a character Who was your favorite interlude character that you made? So any of the small Mark characters?
1938.14 1940.98 speaker2  Oh, okay.
1938.98 1964.42 speaker3  So we got one from Calm Comfy Campground there. Justin, what about you?
1963.42 1966.50 speaker0  Shut the fuck up, Donnie.
1965.26 1971.78 speaker2  Oh, oh yeah. That old chestnut. It's a movie.
1969.78 1976.34 speaker0  No, I really enjoyed being Donovan
1975.50 1981.14 speaker2  He was good. He was really good.
1978.82 1997.18 speaker3  you made some really dark decisions there. hey, you want to get fucking wild? And you were like, anything to give Donovan more power is literally what you responded with.
1995.54 2004.70 speaker0  I would literally, you want me to kill all those members of contention?
2002.82 2045.54 speaker3  what do you need from the community to release the campaign notes in some form? Money. Which actions from the players did you most expect and which was the furthest from what you expected? but most of the time I just, honestly guys, I set up scenarios with the hope that you will surprise me. I don't plan the ending of any of this stuff. we touched on this in another question. I think the most surprising thing has to be the myriad Keith.
2043.10 2055.18 speaker0  Yeah, the myriad Keith name. I didn't plan it.
2052.70 2061.94 speaker2  you had thought of it almost as you said it.
2060.22 2069.06 speaker4  It just says, do what you want.
2066.54 2071.58 speaker3  you've seen in real life? A snake probably.
2070.74 2074.86 speaker4  A snake, yeah.
2073.94 2091.58 speaker2  when I was a little kid. It was so cool. Oh, that's rad. across the concrete of the carport and we thought it was a plastic bag rustling in the wind. It's just loud.
2090.14 2105.02 speaker4  Like a fat snake.
2104.18 2206.38 speaker3  And it was wet. It was a big wet turtle. How much did you cut and did it become less and easier? As time went on. or unnecessary or dead air or me saying um, like with a long space on either side of it. That's mostly what I edit out. I don't edit out a lot of content. when someone says like, hey, let's cut that out. That's typically like a cue to leave everything in. So you really hear pretty much everything that we do. Those of you in the Den of Sin just know that I edit out dead air. I just want listening to this show to be a nonstop fucking ride. And that's kind of been my goal is that it just pushes, pushes, pushes constantly. is Wolf the dog going to still be around in season two? And there's a follow up from Sensory13 that says, and or Justin as a full-time character. Second chance to give us the right answer, Justin.
2205.54 2225.50 speaker0  Fish.
2224.22 2228.80 speaker2  Oh, Justin said, maybe not.
2227.30 2291.86 speaker3  TBD apparently. this is a question for Zach. Were the story arcs inspired by the intro songs at all? Or were you able to find songs that the lyrics oddly tied up with the story arcs? Either way, it's very impressive. before I decided that the balls would rip out your spine. Yeah, right. So the plot of the balls definitely came from No Backbone, but then for the rest of the stuff, anything that was coincidental. and just like threw stuff in every once in a while. There's a really fun thing in Pretty Sexual that's like, I swore I knew you before this.
2291.02 2295.74 speaker0  It was good.
2294.06 2313.46 speaker3  yeah, that probably definitely influenced even though that was gonna be probably part of the plot. Honestly, I don't know. Moving on. It was a lot of back and forth there, I think. Brofos, brofos, brofos, brofos, brofos, brofos, brofos.
2312.22 2317.28 speaker4  Brofose.
2315.22 2577.36 speaker3  in the Cabin in the Woods arc? The hand sanitizer specifically was being used by Mary, M-A-R-Y, Ball, who was Old Madge hanging out in the woods. that could be put on human skin and then would- And it killed bacteria. I hope that answers your question. Denny Cready asks the functions of all the different key devices. Well, you know, I wanna know. Basically, if you used the hand sanitizer, it allowed me as the handler to pull you out of reality and get you, quote, lost. I took the initiative to anytime they were moving from one place to another, they got lost on the way to their destination. So that is what the hand sanitizer did. It allowed me to put the PCs into situations that they were not expecting. Denny Cready says the functions of all the different goo devices is clear apart from the helmet. What exactly does the helmet do? You say that the functions of all the different goo devices is clear. Oh, they also say it seems it's either illusory or allows the user to benefit from other dimensions. The goo devices, let's go over them real quick. First ones, the camera. The camera takes pictures when it has been a certain amount of time in between uses. It was all based on time for these devices, or as we saw Pastor Adam Kane use, you could slam some goo up toward the, the goo was able to travel through glass, and so it could move into any of these devices and then charge them and make that green light lit. The camera was taking pictures of the dark place, the plane that you guys ended up in, and that was all just random and based on plot, how I wanted to do that. It wasn't based on location or time of what you guys were getting in those pictures. The gun, okay, this is the weird one. The gun had a bullet that was in the trunk that John Peters pulled from the green box. specifically made by Keith Beans as Silas Cole to eventually get back there. So she slams the bullet in. The person who used the gun previous was Jermaine Glass, So what happened was John Peters pulls the trunk out of the green box, goes home. He owes the Glass family mob a lot of money. The two brothers show up at John Peters' house to get the money. John Peters grabs the gun to try to defend himself, pulls the trigger, and inside the barrel of this gun, inside the chamber of this gun is, what is it? Not the bullet from the Old West. Therefore, the ooze goes in and fills up the chamber, The next time it's used, Tildi B. Mitchell grabs the bullet that was with it, slams it into the cylinder, and then fires, which sends her to the Old West. Then the gun is used once more, finally, by Rose M-A-R-Y after the ball takes over Rosemary's body, but M-A-R-Y knows how to use this gun. So she blew snot into her hand, which would have filled her hand with ooze, and then she loads the gun with ooze so that she can get to that plane, and that is the gun.
2576.52 2582.88 speaker0  Straightforward. Very straightforward.
2579.80 2587.92 speaker3  The radio is obvious, it switches, you know.
2586.54 2590.40 speaker2  but he brought up the different dimensions.
2589.56 2614.88 speaker3  Radio is obvious. You are correct, though, it is illusory. So when the person who is wielding the helmet passes a power contest against someone, then they can change the reality of the person who they are contesting with by using the helmet.
2613.64 2616.56 speaker2  It is an illusion.
2614.88 2690.20 speaker3  Yeah, it is all illusory. So when you guys were all seeing different stuff with what you thought was real, but as some of you saw, like the repercussions of your decisions came about in a different way. So it wasn't an alternate plane, it was simply illusory. I haven't even seen the new Space Jam, and I know that that's the bad guy's name. It's so cool to know that Don Cheadle listens. Originally, was the officer whose name changes throughout the show supposed to be the gaslight that it was? No. Or did Zach, oh yes, or did Zach Wright forget to write it down in his notes? No. Was it originally going to be memory manipulation, because it was just split dimensions. The whole thing is based off of the Mandela Effect, the Mandela Effect, which I'm a huge fan of.
2689.36 2697.72 speaker2  Exactly.
2694.02 2708.64 speaker3  I immediately called my mom and was like, who wrote the books with the bears? What were they? The bears.
2706.48 2738.96 speaker2  I always thought it was Emily B. Bear. Probably against the terms of service for-
2736.68 2745.40 speaker3  that said that it wasn't able to be used.
2743.00 2768.16 speaker2  If you want to cut this, it does specifically have, there's categories of people who are doing promotion or that's our logo, at least. It's not promotion, it's art, baby. It's art.
2766.58 2777.04 speaker4  Gonna give us $50.
2774.48 2781.34 speaker3  into different iterations of the same world, but infinite versions of that same world.
2779.44 2788.28 speaker0  What a great final question. The final question is-
2785.72 2801.52 speaker2  the ooze and the worms and all that. Are they goopy or are they squamous? Good question, Zach, what does squamous mean?
2796.52 2841.00 speaker3  I've always pictured the ooze as being squamous. I don't believe it. Scaly ooze. Like an old wet turtle. Of course it's squamous. Of course it's squamous. It's a scaly, horrible ooze. It's very goopy and very squamous. No, they're not antithetical, but they're close. They don't quite cancel each other out, but they almost do.
2839.52 2848.94 speaker2  The conundrum is that you didn't-
2845.48 2860.04 speaker3  as both solid and liquid at the same time, and in my mind, that is essentially what this ooze was,
2858.40 2861.92 speaker4  Yeah, but which part of that is scaly?
2860.04 2873.20 speaker3  Dude, if it reached out to you, and you looked at it, and you thought that you would poke your finger up to it, it would be hard, but it's still gooping
2871.32 2874.96 speaker2  But in a repeated scale pattern?
2873.20 2886.48 speaker3  A repeated scale pattern. Scaly? Yeah, squamous.
2883.64 2890.76 speaker2  No, Zach didn't know what that word meant.
2889.52 2892.98 speaker4  Andy Serkis.
2891.80 2925.04 speaker3  It's all that mocap. Maybe the guy who did Jar Jar, since he's the OG. Nice. First one, first one in the biz to do that. Justin, I have a question for you. As you've been making music for the show, have you changed your goal or perspective of each time you sit down to make a track?
2923.30 2970.50 speaker2  Yeah, I actually have been thinking about that because I was like, here's the points I think we should hit, because I can't just make any old random song. I mean, I can, but then it would be like, okay, this is only useful for one really particular moment. So yeah, when I'm thinking about the music, I'm thinking about how it interplays with the, I don't know what the correct term is, the moment to moment of the sound, yes. I'm thinking of how the audio exists. the different tones. What was that? The feeling, the mood.
2969.02 2974.54 speaker0  The start of it all. I, what do you get, oh God,
2972.18 3024.60 speaker2  you guys keep mumbling, interrupting, I can't. So you try to make it good now, right? that fit these moods, but the Western one, the one that has that kind of tinkly guitar or piano riff, maybe it is, that is so perfectly creepy and old timey. Thank you. that there was gonna be the old West arc and be like, all right, let's do some... Basically I took what I would have done, like a weird arpeggiated synth thing or other, or just nasty synth stuff and converted it over
3020.84 3036.84 speaker0  to like Western instruments and stylings and stuff. And so that was very fun.
3034.28 3059.56 speaker2  The Urgent Wind was the time rewind. That one's called A Road, A Rod. A Road. I love it.
3058.24 3060.80 speaker0  No, I also love that one.
3059.56 3083.04 speaker2  That's my favorite track. The one that has the big strings.
3080.16 3096.76 speaker0  Yeah, it's four hours long, so I get it. He's like, hey. Wait, no, you, the listener, not me.
3095.92 3097.60 speaker2  Thanks, Justin.
3096.76 3104.06 speaker3  Thanks, Justin. You're welcome.
3102.60 3116.76 speaker0  As a matter of fact. Unfurls a scroll. Hey, Zach. Good question. What the fuck, bro?
3114.40 3149.02 speaker3  our friendship means a whole bunch to me, and I'm really proud of you, that you're taking the shot at grad school and really focusing on it. And while doing that, we've created the artistic collaboration that I've been most proud of in my entire life. And we've collaborated on a lot of artistic stuff together And this is like really fun to make. And I'm really glad that you're on the team. Thank you.
3148.20 3151.08 speaker0  Me too.
3149.86 3154.84 speaker2  We weren't talking to the rest of you. This is me and Zach's time. Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.
3154.02 3164.96 speaker0  I'm sorry.
3162.88 3171.18 speaker2  Everyone should try it sometime. Seriously. When you first started this,
3168.80 3176.24 speaker4  and we would make new ones or were you? Yeah. Yeah. Yep.
3173.68 3198.32 speaker3  And I thought you'd have new ones. We're gonna do that in season two, by the way. I'm gonna pull out the rug from some of those Pulp Cthulhu rules that we're using. And we're gonna go a little bit harder on Delta Green to get some nice, satisfying character death.
3197.24 3206.84 speaker4  This is. If you want to hear me play a minion, subscribe to the Patreon. Nope. That is also gonna be on the main feed.
3206.00 3207.66 speaker3  That is?
3206.84 3212.44 speaker4  Yeah. Do it anyway.
3211.60 3220.38 speaker2  Oh, that's right.
3218.62 3225.38 speaker3  and you play guru? Yes.
3222.22 3233.26 speaker4  Yes, we will be doing that before season two.
3231.46 3247.42 speaker3  I quit if you don't edit that out.
3246.58 3261.26 speaker0  Pudding. Yeah.
3258.10 3344.92 speaker3  We're gonna be back next week, actually. We're gonna be back next week. If you follow along on Instagram or Twitter or Facebook, Reddit or Discord or any of the places where you can find out information from us outside of just listening to our voices speak, then you know that on November 5th, the first episode will be out of a short five episode run that we're doing with a guest handler running us through the Delta Green scenario, and Arc Dream publishing right now and our handler was able to get his hands on straight from the source of Shane Ivy, a copy of the updated version of Convergence for the new Delta Green role playing game to run for us. And then after that, on the main feed, I will be running Control Copy, another Delta Green scenario, this one written by Dennis Detwiller, which the patrons voted on over on patreon.com slash pretending pod. They chose Control Copy for me to run for this crew and that'll be out after Convergence. And so that's what we've got ready now and more on the horizon. And we're all really, really looking forward to it.
3342.62 3349.14 speaker4  I can't wait to play.
3347.58 3349.14 speaker2  Oh yeah. Pweloo, how can you have enough
