166.80 189.80 speaker0  the links are in the show notes. Don't blink, don't think, just sink into the deep. It's time for the news.
184.80 220.60 speaker1  But Julius is clearly having a harder time dealing with recent events. Will Cal and Beck agree to work alongside X?
216.60 271.60 speaker0  My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.
265.60 352.60 speaker2  I beat up who's ever keeping me from the meat bins and take what's mine. Yeah, that'd be good. Banana peppers are solid. Cuc, tomato, Sammy. Cuc on either side of the tomato with some Dijon mustard. Yeah, the Sammy was the cucumber. The cuc was the bread. Technically cheese is part of that first bracket. I'll just eat tomatoes with oil and vinegar. There you go. You guys throw some oregano on there? Oh, he's definitely getting that on the tomato. Maybe a little salt and pepper too.
350.60 363.60 speaker3  Oregano soup. I'm going to say you can toast it. You can toast it.
362.60 374.60 speaker2  That's the perk.
373.60 387.60 speaker3  That's it.
386.60 392.60 speaker2  Yeah, we should have been recording that.
390.60 395.60 speaker3  Oh, yeah. Can we shout out Cinder Crow?
394.60 401.60 speaker2  Who's doing it? Or wherever you're from.
399.60 406.60 speaker1  You're our American hero.
403.60 422.60 speaker3  and it's really detailed and good, so what if we made some funny sounds and words to see what it does? Flurbin, lurbin, shlick.
421.60 433.60 speaker2  Which ones am I using? You're a nightmare to people like him. Who knows?
432.60 436.60 speaker3  Seriously.
434.60 441.60 speaker2  Huge shout out to Cinder Crow. Absolutely. That is so insane. You rock. Thank you so much.
440.60 455.60 speaker3  Bazinga.
452.60 465.60 speaker2  I mean, that seems... Well, we can do those. It's just you've got notes.
463.60 484.60 speaker3  No, I'll still do it. This life venture, right?
480.60 522.60 speaker2  or if you know someone who would be into the transcripts, you can find them. They're linked over on our Discord, and you can find that Discord... In the show notes. In the show notes. And so pretty soon, none of us will be necessary, which means all of your Patreon money will go straight to making the pod better.
518.60 536.60 speaker3  and my favorite part was the guy who is playing Luke, and he says, This mystery's mysterious! And then fart noises for 45 seconds. It's absurdly accurate.
535.60 548.60 speaker2  Yeah. Human fart noise. Taylor just walked in. Wow.
547.60 555.60 speaker3  Bye. We can cut all that out. Just the end and the buy.
554.60 568.60 speaker2  and it was fucking... It was after dark. I had not turned my French ports light on, so I just get this knock on my door, and I can see nothing. I turned the light on.
567.60 580.60 speaker3  It's good he wasn't blurry. And I was like, Well, you know, this isn't the highest crime area,
579.60 603.60 speaker2  I know there's a lot of petty crimes, like package thefts and car break-ins, so if you'd be interested in a camera or anything, and I was like, Oh no, I'm the one doing all those, so I don't want any more cameras. He just laughed nervously, and then I shut the door on him. He said,
601.60 610.60 speaker3  You should buy all my cameras then. Once they're gone, they're gone.
608.60 620.60 speaker2  and it must have been the knock. My doorbell doesn't work.
612.60 621.60 speaker3  And a young lad on one of those bird scooters.
620.60 624.60 speaker2  It wasn't a bird. It was a plane.
623.60 627.60 speaker3  Superman.
626.60 630.60 speaker2  Oh, those. Like, yeah. Like a hoverboard thing.
629.60 633.60 speaker3  They call them hoverboards. Yeah, the hoverboard.
631.60 644.60 speaker2  He was just hoverboarding around the neighborhood. Nice. How old was he? Seven, yeah. Those labor laws, man, in Missouri.
643.60 653.60 speaker3  What was he selling?
650.60 672.60 speaker2  Oh, no, I'm sorry. I'm not wearing pants. These are ticks. You got pests everywhere. Should we do it?
671.60 676.60 speaker3  I'm really excited to do it. I don't know what we're going to do.
674.60 702.60 speaker2  You just said, like, pants made out of ticks. That's what Beck Wilder sees. the intern. Jeremy.
700.60 703.60 speaker3  Yeah, we'll say co-worker.
702.60 708.60 speaker2  X.
706.60 725.60 speaker3  But technically true. But so his roommate is technically true as well. She's many things. Isn't she your boss? Some people could look at it that way. Sure.
717.60 795.60 speaker2  And they're all, you're all at the close to empty house where Julius and X are living. It's Wednesday, July 6th, 2022, and it is quite late. On a fairly rough note, even though he just taken the time to clean a few folks' guts and spray from off himself and change suits, Julius is openly bleeding once again, half of his face now scraped in raw, beating up with his own blood. Jeremy, the intern, stands up from the Ikea couch and stretches his arms and legs while And on his way out, he squares his shoulders to Cal and assures you, Just idle nose and coffees for everyone. And with that, he's off. 48 hours? before you were to be named the new producer.
794.60 801.60 speaker3  Yep.
795.60 823.60 speaker2  And X looking down at her phone says to Julius, I've just alerted the doctor. She's on her way. She looks down at her phone again.
822.60 854.60 speaker3  Hmm. Is it going to be the usual or, I mean, do we have access to those Godel things? I can attest that they work like a charm, dude. He got killed. No, not killed, but almost died from a rabbit.
848.60 863.60 speaker2  tied up with antlers to resemble a jackalope and then left to wander willy nilly. And of course it was going to impale someone. You know, of course someone was going to trip and impale themselves on that. It was a hazard. It was a hazard. But yes, the medicine thing they had.
862.60 876.60 speaker3  It wasn't my fault. So, like, do we? I don't feel very good. He kind of does, though. Look at him.
875.60 886.60 speaker2  How many hit points do you have? It's all rushing back to him. It hurts.
883.60 905.60 speaker3  I'm at 40 percent capacity, it feels like. I had the napkins shoved in me and they were helping.
902.60 911.60 speaker2  And Beck winks at Stevie. Yeah, man. Good work. Thanks.
910.60 921.60 speaker3  Is she coming here?
920.60 1012.60 speaker2  The door slams open. What is the doctor, Murray? And this elderly woman with thick gray hair, thin and wiry and built five feet tall and created by Chainsaw Unicorn from Augusta, Georgia. Whoa, is that what a unicorn sounds like? Chainsaw Unicorn is patron at at least the $10 level over on patreon.com slash pretending pod. And you too can send in an NPC or a location at that tier and support the show over there. And I don't know if you can see. I don't know if you can see, but I'm wearing clothes that are two sizes too big. But yes, I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you out. Who's the benevolent neither of the help. Oh, look at you. Look at your face.
1006.60 1024.60 speaker3  Julius looks at Cal and Beck and is like, yeah, they're generally pretty. They're always this weird.
1021.60 1033.60 speaker2  So why don't you want to go to a fucking hospital?
1030.60 1049.60 speaker3  Yeah, sure. They're all a little weird, but not like this. Julius rips his shirt off and just points to his bloody mess with napkins and everything shoved in it.
1043.60 1084.60 speaker2  Okay, you're going to need to have your lay down on the on the kitchen island table over there, the countertop. Just strip on down to your baccas. Yeah, I heard I heard about the incident the last time. Oh, Mr. Big Thighs had had is the doctor. Things got bad. And now we can we talk less? That's kind of my whole thing. Okay. Tell me. But with a Swift, let's see a Swift. Oh, a extreme.
1083.60 1089.60 speaker3  It's not good.
1088.60 1143.60 speaker2  Fuck yeah. Basically without you even realizing it. And then for the final critical role trick here, she goes, oh, and I got something real fucking neat for your face. Everything previous has just been in her bag. And inside the suitcase, you see a contraption that, while familiar, does have very specifically different sort of branding.
1142.60 1158.60 speaker3  Yeah.
1157.60 1176.60 speaker2  Thank you. Dicked dildo. Oh my God. Can you imagine? I've seen that. Those are the two kinds of jokes you're going to get here pretending to be people.
1174.60 1189.60 speaker3  Oh doc, patch me up. What do you call that thing?
1186.60 1222.60 speaker2  I don't know what the folks upstairs are going to call it. And she slams, she slams this, uh, this device on, on Julius Summers face. You know, when the question itself is so wrong, you don't know where to begin to answer.
1220.60 1240.60 speaker1  Does it feel good?
1236.60 1251.60 speaker2  Uh, go ahead and, sorry, I was waiting for whatever this is. Feels so good.
1250.60 1266.60 speaker3  Yeah.
1251.60 1313.60 speaker2  Dr. Murray says, and you feel the, these like warm rays like shining in, penetrating, and then you feel a sort of tingle almost like a, like a foaming sensation that you can hear. Yeah. Pop rocks with a mouthful of Sprite. And you feel warm. You feel nice. She pulls it off and everyone looking sees Julius Summers with a face, a whole face.
1312.60 1320.60 speaker3  It feels great. I mean, God, we, we got to tell people about this stuff.
1319.60 1327.60 speaker2  Yeah, what do you need? What is going on?
1325.60 1330.60 speaker3  Why don't you just give me a top up?
1328.60 1348.60 speaker2  You said it was a, you sat on it. Yeah. All right. Face down. Ass up. All right. That's the way I'll stitch you up. You got it.
1347.60 1367.60 speaker1  jacket. Yeah.
1366.60 1371.60 speaker2  Huge thumbs. We never talked about it.
1369.60 1376.60 speaker3  Did I recover any hit points from the face? Uh, healing. Uh, no, that was with two rolls.
1375.60 1379.60 speaker2  That was your sweet.
1377.60 1388.60 speaker3  At least I look good. Julius thinks and then makes a note to go check.
1386.60 1412.60 speaker2  All anchors carry these all reporters carry these. Take a look at that. Oh, you want, you like, you want to have one. And uh, what, what firm? Well, the program, you know, the group, you know? Yeah. What's that called?
1411.60 1424.60 speaker3  No name for it. Obviously.
1422.60 1443.60 speaker2  My dear boy. Wink, wink. She winks.
1441.60 1460.60 speaker3  Oh my God. So you're military.
1458.60 1489.60 speaker2  What kind of doctor are you Dr. Murray? Mostly, uh, surgical. People? Of course.
1487.60 1503.60 speaker3  He probably, Stevie.
1500.60 1506.60 speaker1  Breaks in the news cycle like this don't come often, Stevie.
1505.60 1543.48 speaker2  No, you're right. upvotes on it. That's a lot. Yeah. And it is a hole in the ground somewhere in South America.
1542.48 1549.08 speaker1  Uh oh.
1548.08 1556.20 speaker2  He's gone international.
1554.40 1563.88 speaker3  Is this a particularly smooth hole?
1562.40 1603.96 speaker2  Um, wow. now the, yeah, that no one's going near the hole cause they can actually see down, but they can keep seeing down until they can't see any more down, I guess.
1602.36 1646.52 speaker3  So it's like a place that you vacation? Where's it from? This happened in Chile. Okay.
1640.64 1648.52 speaker2  Reddit article that is in Europe and it's like a huge hole in the ground.
1646.52 1659.12 speaker3  That's very smooth. Stevie how many, how many of these are there? I don't know.
1652.20 1678.56 speaker2  I just started seeing them like today, but there, there seems to be a few, a fair, fair amount of them. One went through a building like half, like half of a building is just like gone.
1677.56 1701.92 speaker3  are for?
1700.92 1748.64 speaker2  out or whatever. And then I let it out or whatever. On the bridge? I didn't know it was there. I didn't, he just did like immediately. What did you see? I mean, I saw the same as everybody else. I wasn't even over there, but I didn't know what it was at first and it started dawning
1745.12 1754.20 speaker3  How come God couldn't teleport out of Grover's gorge? Is there a spell?
1752.20 1764.60 speaker2  I think he was in a turtle. Or maybe there's a spell like, oh, that might be it.
1763.60 1788.24 speaker3  Or slow holes? Oh, there you go. They might've looked like potholes, divots, but very smooth.
1785.32 1793.20 speaker2  It's been a long day.
1792.04 1827.08 speaker3  Oh, energy drink? Give me one. Oh, okay. Yeah. Me too. Go, go, go. Well, where are the... I don't know. Can we... Let's maybe start plotting them out. Maybe it's a drawing. Maybe it's a symbol. A good old fashioned connect the dots. We saw symbols in the pit. Maybe that's it.
1825.80 1853.00 speaker2  Let's Google map them. Yeah, those Reddit tweets have been breaking a lot of shit on us. Yeah, they could move this forward like so fast.
1851.20 1856.24 speaker3  I feel like sometimes everything I say is wrong.
1855.24 1871.08 speaker2  No, no. No, it's good. I can't. I can't ask. And they're just like going through the phone and...
1867.56 1873.84 speaker1  He's already had burner accounts that he can start putting stuff in different forms.
1872.60 1890.04 speaker3  I think I do. Yeah, that's it. It does not take computer science to know how to troll on Reddit with backup accounts. What skill do you want me to roll?
1888.56 1891.04 speaker2  It's the only one that makes sense.
1890.04 1900.96 speaker1  Oh, fuck. Hold on.
1898.96 1987.12 speaker3  What's your percent? Okay. You were upvoting. It was clear that you were upvoting from the same like ISP on your multiple accounts. Julius pulls his phone out, but can't figure out how to navigate off of the leg day subreddit. So he just puts it back. He doesn't want to leave that page anyway. Does he see anything? I have zero. It's spelled H-O-L-E. And everybody gets what he's talking about. So it's the highest upvoted on the page right now. So there's no map made or what? How long is it going to take these nerds?
1981.92 2024.20 speaker2  Like, I mean, they don't always crack everything like right away and even if they do, it might
2018.16 2027.20 speaker1  Is a SIGINT specifically technology or could it be used to like decipher a cipher? It's absolutely.
2026.20 2028.20 speaker2  Specifically.
2027.20 2033.20 speaker1  For deciphering. Yeah. If we lay out the plots, can I use a SIGINT roll?
2032.20 2040.20 speaker2  All right. Let's roll those SIGINTs boys.
2039.20 2056.40 speaker3  Damn. You got a 69. It's just like dots on a map.
2055.40 2064.72 speaker2  It does. It just looks like dots on a map.
2062.12 2082.32 speaker3  ways, maybe that will come to fruition for us. Have we tried calling your brother?
2076.96 2145.16 speaker2  They hold their phone up and it's like outgoing call, outgoing call, outgoing call, outgoing call, outgoing call, outgoing call. And he looked afraid. And I, I just, I wanted to show that I was on its side and I wanted to, I thought that if I could prove that I wasn't a threat, you know, like, I don't know, I, when he,
2143.20 2157.88 speaker1  Like, was he like scared?
2156.16 2193.48 speaker2  like he, it looked like he was there. It looked like, it looked like Greg and just like a single tear rolled down his face and then he wasn't, rolled for what? I called after him and I ran for him and I, I tried to grab onto him and push me off.
2189.64 2199.00 speaker3  It wasn't, it wasn't him, it wasn't him anymore.
2193.48 2241.52 speaker2  It wasn't, just kept walking.
2240.02 2267.12 speaker3  Yeah, at the bridge hole. You didn't tell me about the bridge hole.
2266.12 2275.36 speaker1  subsequent holes.
2272.80 2282.80 speaker3  But you and Julius were here before the hole. What were you here doing?
2281.80 2298.76 speaker2  Yeah.
2297.76 2299.76 speaker1  You have one.
2298.76 2312.32 speaker3  Yeah. I mean, we got them, they got them, but it's kind of like the government's scared to like tell people so they want to expose it so that they're the bad guys that gets everybody scared
2309.64 2315.76 speaker1  and then we can just make it normal.
2314.76 2321.80 speaker2  In my mind? Uh, nothing. Do you feel that? Yeah. Okay.
2319.96 2336.52 speaker3  Why does Godel have to be the bad guy? Oh, because you know, some people are like, don't be God. And so they can, if, Hey, if it's all good stuff, then Godel, that's good. If it's all bad stuff, then it's not us. That's good.
2334.84 2338.52 speaker2  It turns out it's good.
2337.52 2368.68 speaker3  It's good for everybody. Cow's looking at X. What power is this? Like the humanity's hope. He looks at X to see if that was a good answer or not. How do you get that hope out of a human?
2366.80 2375.44 speaker2  We just don't know.
2374.44 2421.92 speaker3  2000? It seems like a miracle technology. it. 94. and how that makes you feel, but that's going to be everybody. And they're going to be mad about that.
2419.22 2431.68 speaker1  and you got a hold of their part of their contract? Did the Godels make one specifically for one for the military?
2428.00 2491.64 speaker2  Those are all big questions, Mr. Wilder. to it, I probably wouldn't, you know, it'd be hard to get a replacement. You know what I mean?
2489.08 2493.64 speaker1  Like a machine that makes cappuccinos on demand?
2492.64 2501.64 speaker2  Well, we already did. Okay.
2500.64 2537.12 speaker3  Cow's like, yeah. Yeah. Beck. of knocked it over with your camera. Yeah. I told you there's no, yes. And I told you there's nothing to fear. It's just a cappuccino maker.
2536.12 2547.56 speaker2  think of. Another one of those.
2540.56 2560.76 speaker3  Dr. Murray X, can we have Dr. Murray's thing for our dangerous mission to find God? Yes. Uh, you cannot have her device.
2559.76 2566.60 speaker2  Thank you so much for your time.
2560.76 2586.08 speaker3  Can I human that to see if she's lying and that we can have it?
2585.08 2587.08 speaker2  Yeah.
2586.08 2592.08 speaker0  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2588.08 2600.16 speaker2  I hope you're feeling better and, uh, everyone, uh, feel good and stuff. Don't, don't have any need for me. Okay.
2599.16 2605.28 speaker1  Do you have a card?
2604.28 2641.72 speaker2  And she shuts the door. Last night.
2639.80 2642.72 speaker1  Dr. Murray, did you forget to tell us anything?
2641.72 2686.70 speaker3  She's having a stroke. She's just standing there. She's just standing there. Stuck frozen. Hey Julius, could I have my makeup kit back?
2685.70 2755.82 speaker2  It was a woman. wild story in this whole time. She's just poking her head out back into the door of Julius and X's place. Total cleanup over at the zeitgeist. There was people in half. Yeah. It was very strange. Did they see what happened? Well, I mean, there was a woman there and she was like all sorts of wild. She was a fine girl. Yeah. No, no, no. At the zeitgeist. The printing press. No, that's the drink. Where are we? We're at bucky kid's bar.
2754.82 2841.58 speaker3  No, the first bar. The foundry. The foundry. Sorry. I was confused. Space Needle. I think you just call them Space Needles. They don't have another name, do they? Huh? It's our city's famous spire. Was it cool or was it like gimmicky? Cal's eyes get misty and he like looks into the distance and a single tear rolls down his cheek and he says, it was very cool. he longs to have been able to go to the rotating restaurant. Top class. What happened?
2840.58 2843.50 speaker2  Does that thing?
2841.58 2854.34 speaker3  Yeah, would it fix a half? How much can that thing grow back?
2853.34 2873.30 speaker2  open. What the?
2871.54 2924.10 speaker3  What if we go check out the halves? I think we should go. I mean, we got two days until we can run the scratch fixer 2000 or what our skin graft 2000. We've got the nerds working on this on the, on the, on the read it. Yeah. And then, I mean, we also got, we got other programmers out there fixing the holes or something, right X? Yes. Let's go. We can get a new news story about the halves. Yeah. We can make a whole like other story, the B block. The story can be called like, uh, it's like half, but it's like one over Z cause it happened at the zeitgeist. Sure. Yeah. We'll think about that.
2923.10 2928.26 speaker1  Yeah.
2927.26 2933.30 speaker3  And it's halves. Okay. Yeah. I was going to be the producer one day.
2932.30 2952.62 speaker1  I was going to be the producer. You're a pretty good producer.
2946.68 2959.00 speaker2  claiming that someone was trying to get into someone else's stomach.
2956.34 2974.60 speaker3  And there was, uh, beer, uh, something to do with beer involved. I remember that. Google Kaylee silver. Yeah.
2972.76 2979.16 speaker2  Well, I mean, I'll need some help here. How long do these things take to go to trial?
2978.16 2998.08 speaker3  Depends. Cal's reading the article over your shoulder. He's like, wow, that was fast. If there's one thing about the city, it's the kind of lack of crazy crime. That's usually our thing.
2997.08 3010.04 speaker1  Swift justice. What? Yeah.
3009.04 3011.04 speaker3  Yeah.
