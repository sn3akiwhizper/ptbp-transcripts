0.00 23.88 speaker0  Hello, good friends of the podcast called Pretending To Be People. It is the wolf, the dog, w-wolf the dog, with a special announcement this fine morn-vening.
20.04 33.52 speaker1  In fact, it ain't even part of this here campaign.
29.28 218.68 speaker0  situations we last left Julius Beck and Cal. In this premium, exclusive content from our contention-confidential feed is the episode one of a six-part series that Thomas has entitled, The Lost Treasure of John Lee Pettymore. That's right, Thomas is the GM, and he's running a story set in the holler outside of contention been calling the Oops All Pettymores campaign, because Joe, Luke, and Zatch are all playing members of the extended Pettymore family, and let me tell y'all the what, it's been as well as the 30-something bonus episodes that came before. Now I'm not saying you need the bonus content, but I am saying that if you did need all this to provide an all-new, all-banging theme, provided by one of Joe's dad's bands. It's the Morels with Get What You Need. I need a boat. I need a plane. I need a car. I need a train. I need a pill. I need a drink. I need a smoke. I need a drink. I need an eight-foot couch and a four-foot screen. A big vacation and a dog that's mean. I need a four-wheel drive and a three-piece suit. A nine-millimeter that I know I can shoot. In the USA, it's not a question of greed. Cause everybody who is anybody agrees. For followers the ones who lead. You get what you need. I'm ready.
216.68 273.16 speaker1  Brad's Monkey! Brad's Monkey Monkey! The Funky Monkey! Is it not, Luke? It is. The title of this one is, remind me, Thomas? The Hunt. No. The Lost Treasure of John Lee Pettymore.
271.16 278.40 speaker2  You're all cousins to somebody. The working title in all of my notes is Oops All Pettymores. Oops All Pettymores.
277.40 296.40 speaker1  Exactly. So I think the Pettymores cousins are going to go on a treasure hunt.
290.40 299.40 speaker2  It's Thomas' job to make it serious and call episodes bad blood.
296.40 313.64 speaker1  And it's up to us to say, Oops All Pettymores! Well, I did want to say, while tonight we'll be searching for treasure, you can find treasure, especially for the holiday season, at Target. Target is the best destination for treasure. That bit hasn't come out yet.
312.64 320.64 speaker2  It hasn't come out yet. You're right, this is a sneak peek.
317.64 330.64 speaker1  So guys, go shop at Target. That is what you get here in the Dennis Inn. That's a bit from an episode we recorded yesterday, last night.
327.64 344.88 speaker2  So it's some pretty fresh stuff for you. Some pretty hot sauce. We asked for some sins in the chat.
343.88 347.88 speaker1  What did I say? A different Zach.
345.88 371.12 speaker2  Zach with a K. Like this one?
370.12 393.36 speaker1  Apologize? You make fun of him. How much does your boss hate shitting? How much do you need your job? How much do you personally value honesty as an individual? How much is that going to eat you up? Are you the kind of person who, if you know you have to lie to your boss about the fact that you made him shit his pants?
391.36 398.36 speaker2  Every day for the rest of your life until you die because there won't be retirement for us.
396.36 434.60 speaker1  Is that going to fuck with you? One day you guys are sharing what the worst thing that ever happened to you was What about you? That's when you tell him. Honestly, it was the day that I accidentally gave you laxative So if that would eat you up, just get it over with.
432.60 451.84 speaker2  There's somebody talking about that they found this cheap beer called Montucky Cold Snacks and just the name alone makes me want to taste it. Have you not had it? Totoro's Bang Bus has been recruiting people for a year to drink it because it makes really good Brad's Monkeys.
449.84 465.84 speaker1  That funky monkey.
463.84 482.08 speaker2  I don't go to that section.
479.08 494.08 speaker1  It looks like if they made Outrun Horse Show. Uh huh. What's an Outrun Horse Show? Come on down! No, it's like Knight Rider, but a horse.
492.08 498.08 speaker2  The horse always wins.
496.08 504.08 speaker1  Who's faster than a horse?
502.08 516.32 speaker2  radio plays that had Superman racing the Flash And what I understand, Superman always won and I always think that that sucks because The Flash has one thing and it's to be fast
514.32 518.32 speaker1  And he's still not the best.
516.32 520.32 speaker2  And if he loses to Superman, that's just sad.
518.32 530.32 speaker1  That's such a bummer for him. Man, if you had that kind of power, wouldn't you become I don't know, an authoritarian fascist or just indifferent? That might be interesting to explore.
528.32 532.32 speaker2  That kind of Superman.
530.32 534.32 speaker1  Has anybody ever done a bad Superman?
532.32 538.32 speaker2  Who would try to put him down like some sort of
536.32 542.32 speaker1  It's probably going to have to be another group of pretty shrewdly realized superhero
540.32 550.32 speaker2  parodies. Wait, what? Who are we talking about?
548.32 560.32 speaker1  Well, a number of different IPs. Where he's a kid?
558.32 562.32 speaker2  I haven't seen it, but I remember the whole thing was that
560.32 566.32 speaker1  it was bad Superman. Oh, Hancock.
564.32 570.32 speaker2  No.
568.32 572.32 speaker1  Yeah.
570.32 576.32 speaker2  He's right, Joe.
574.32 604.32 speaker1  Brightburn. Because it's like, oh, Superman, he's bad, but what are you going to do? Oh, and he can do crazy stuff. Yeah, I've got Brightburn.
602.32 624.32 speaker2  What do we do? What do we do? What do we do? Yeah, what do we do to get the fire back
622.32 626.32 speaker1  Loins burning.
624.32 642.32 speaker2  It's strange. They're not that far apart in age. It's not that weird. Thomas. Yeah. I'm rearing to go. I'm ready to play a pettymore for the nth time.
640.32 652.32 speaker1  I've never played a pettymore. Are you excited? Yeah.
650.32 656.32 speaker2  You wouldn't let me read it, though.
654.32 660.32 speaker1  Of course not. There's secrets in here
658.32 666.32 speaker2  I've got my intro in mind, but unless the story reads it, I think I should go first
664.32 680.32 speaker1  can go after me. after Zach. Actually, we might sandwich Zach. Joe, you told me you literally had dreams about rehearsing yours.
678.32 682.32 speaker2  It's not a page-long, is all.
680.32 702.32 speaker1  Okay, Luke can go first and give Zach time to write his. trying to be me as vengeance or if we are the same person. then...
700.32 706.32 speaker2  Welcome to my life. Did you get it?
704.32 722.32 speaker1  Is that how we're kicking off? No, there's some stuff. about the episode for the Patreon?
720.32 726.32 speaker2  Hello audio listeners. Hello audio listeners.
724.32 744.32 speaker1  You guys have missed so much that we talked about before in the Patreon. So go ahead and up those Patreons. Did you know Chris D'Elia died?
742.32 750.32 speaker2  though, because Joe's over here scrolling
748.32 754.32 speaker1  I got the update, I got the CNN update
752.32 770.32 speaker2  and I said that aloud. Which confused Zach. Because I thought he said that Chris D'Elia died and then Thomas goes, aww,
768.32 810.32 speaker1  Like someone you cared about I watched that pervert episode of Workaholics all the time before I went to bed. because it was just on like the nightbox as I was going to bed as a young one. by the time you hear this episode edited as a Patreon listener. is episode one of The Lost Treasure of John Lee Pettymore. It's called Bad Blood. Bad Blood.
808.32 820.32 speaker2  And everybody made me mad.
818.32 840.32 speaker1  an oops all Pettymore arc where all the boys are going to be playing family members of my character John Lee Pettymore from season one. And we kind of established during that season that he has a very big extended family who are
838.32 850.32 speaker2  areas. Huge smoking big doinks in Amish.
848.32 864.32 speaker1  because some of you might remember what happened at the end of season one. Spoilers. Spoilers. Spoilers.
862.32 876.32 speaker2  the beautifully round shape off riding into the sunset of Planet Juggernaut he looked at that shape and said
874.32 892.32 speaker1  Oh. I thought you did this intentionally but I don't know. I was like damn I respect the fuck out of Luke when I listen to like episode 15 or 16 and Keith literally says like I'd like to
890.32 898.32 speaker2  I think it's just something That's just the Luke
896.32 900.32 speaker1  preoccupation that you brought into
898.32 902.32 speaker2  the character.
900.32 922.32 speaker1  Which is a great no it's the who shot Mr. Burns episode. point of the movie. Oh they do a dome in the movie who shot Mr. Burns he just builds a giant thing that blocks out the sun. If you want to block out
920.32 930.32 speaker2  during this episode you can put up your hand like that in a particular way in front of that camera that can block one of us from sight. Yeah.
928.32 934.32 speaker1  That's me. I'm gone now. I was trying to block you all.
932.32 944.32 speaker2  That's all of us. You're all going to be playing Betty Morris.
942.32 1030.32 speaker1  And times are a little tough for the Betty Morris. Jon in the way that cousins often are. Some of you are a little older. One of you is pretty much right at Jon's age. But he's been missing for a year at this point. He's not the only anymore missing. Don D. Pettymore is gone. Jimmy Sanders is gone. There's some talk about Aloysius and Edward. Some sort of foul play that might have happened involving Jon but nobody really knows. You've only heard rumors. And when you were all growing up you would come to Pettymore Holler at least every year if you didn't actually live there for the big family cookout. A huge Pettymore reunion. And it's been five or six years since that's actually been put on. or a handwritten note from Ma Pettymore, the family matriarch. We can work I think even though some of you are older it's plausible you're all within the same generation of cousins Wow. The math on that is horrible. It sucks. She's like 77.
1028.32 1052.32 speaker2  97. She's turning 70. That's what I wrote on the Patreon is that it was her 70th birthday. She's turning 70. Okay, that helps a little bit. Put in a second grade. Make it weird. No.
1050.32 1106.32 speaker1  She's your great-grandmother and she's called you all here today for the first Pettymore cookout, hoedown, get-together, hootenanny of all the family property in Pettymore Haller, which is where John lives on the edge of. place. She says, it's not just a birthday celebration. This is about family, remembering, and our future. And so in one way or the other, you all make your way from wherever it is you live to John Lee Pettymore's house on the outside of contention. And it's not really the same as you remember getting there last time. The Haller itself is located in between, um, I've actually got something written for this. I could just start reading. Yeah, you should do that.
1104.32 1116.32 speaker2  Do a good voice. the puddle.
1114.32 1170.32 speaker1  The home and property of John Lee Pettymore. John Lee Pettymore sits just above the cleavage that separates the two local prominences known as big and little beans A cleavage that, for as long as anyone can remember, has borne your family's name. Pettymore Haller. Generations of Pettymores have lived and died between the teats, tending to the land, themselves, and generally honoring the bounty the good Lord has seen fit to bless them with. That's at least how the Pettymore tells it. But God doesn't make bras big enough for mountains. And you know as well as every outsider within 50 miles that the Haller has never truly contained your rowdy, wild, and extremely prolific clan. You're all driving. There's one way into contention, pretty much. The highway. And you're driving down some familiar farm farmland, wide open spaces. As you get closer to contention, the land becomes more treed
1168.32 1174.32 speaker2  and hillier. And about 10 miles outside
1172.32 1192.32 speaker1  construction barricade across the highway, diverting you onto Farm Road 67. detour, roll an alertness
1190.32 1198.32 speaker2  Ooh. Already rolling.
1196.32 1262.32 speaker1  I pass. 18 on a 50. Okay, you two grumble a little bit and take the detour. But Luke, you would notice, and we'll get to who you are in just a second, but you would notice that pretty much as far as you can see past the barricades, you don't see any signs of construction. There's no equipment. There's no upturned earth. It just seems like abandoned highway for as long as you can see until it disappears kind of project, so maybe it's just further on down closer to contention itself. And you all take Farm Road 60 in your own ways. has to offer, all the natural beauty you grew up with, or at least spent time around as children, like to some extent. to John's pretty much. Give me just a second.
1260.32 1280.32 speaker2  I'm in the hauler. I'm there. I'm a drone right now. I'm a drone in some cleavage.
1278.32 1304.32 speaker1  crossroads of Farm Road 67 and Jiminy Road, which sits pretty much directly at this small unincorporated community known as Jiminy Station. There's a little gas station and bed and breakfast there and a couple of like abandoned mid-century commercial buildings. You would know that, you know, if 50 people lived in Jiminy Station in the 70s, maybe less than
1302.32 1310.32 speaker2  two dozen do now. You take Jiminy
1308.32 1444.32 speaker1  Which leads to the heart of Pettymore Hauler. And you see, you see all the ancestral fiefdom. You see Ma Pettymore's house. You see some frankly less well camped properties. Sites you're pretty familiar with though. A lot of pettymoors don't like to get rid of things. They like to keep them around in case they need them. So if you prefer that to a yard, you know, whose business is that but yours? And when you get to the gates of John's Farm, you see the front field is completely packed with parked cars. And there's already a pretty broad gathering. Dozens and dozens of pettymoors all around these tables and whole family there. For the first time in years. Relatives you haven't seen since you were small. Some you might have seen more recently. But everyone is so happy. Luke, we're gonna do Tell me and then I'll go. pulls in to this cookout, you park and you get out of your car. And who gets out? Who are you? Where are you from? are born in and roam the hollers near contention. Bears, coyotes, bobcats, and pettymoors live their entire lives there until they're eaten, shot, or hit with a truck. The latter two spell the end of Bernie Pettymore but only after he fathered his first and only son Peter Bernard Pettymore. Peter Bernard Pettymore, known around the hollers as mother along with plenty of help from the rest of the Pettymore clan. Upon graduating high school, a relatively uncommon accomplishment in his neck of the woods, Petey left the comfort of the holler to pursue his dream. Flying. Peter packed up the few belongings he had, hitchhiked his way to Colorado, and joined the United States Air Force Academy. After four long years of intensive study and training, Pete joined the Air Force and at long last took to the skies. Although a handful of Pettymoors had taken trips in planes and even more had conquered the land and sea, Petey was the first of his name to make a home
1442.32 1448.32 speaker2  fulfilling his duty to the United States military,
1446.32 1498.32 speaker1  frontier, Florida. Petey accepted a position at NASA honing his scientific skills and offering his perfected piloting prowess for the furtherance of humanity and safety of the planet. outlandish, and often completely fabricated. But Petey knows the truth and that's all that matters to him. secret rocket ship to shoot a missile bomb at a giant accumulation of space trash that was headed right for Kilimanjaro. Would have wiped out the whole eastern hemisphere but we nailed that sucker and blew it back to Alpha Centauri. What was some poor alien's fucker's problem pale ale, which is the secret beer we
1496.32 1504.32 speaker2  brew at NASA. Yep,
1502.32 1552.32 speaker1  a long sip from his Miller Lite and size, looking over at his conversation partner, a young disheveled Pettymore boy concentrating on his Game Boy. Without waiting for a response, Petey chugs his beer, stands up, and crushes the beer under his black combat boots. The camera pans up from the crushed can and we see a blue jumper adorned with a NASA patch, an American flag, and an embroidered name tag that reads Commander Petey B. Peteymore. The top of the jumper is unzipped, revealing a black graphic t-shirt emblazoned with a cartoon astronaut eating a peach and the text that says Eat NASA. slick-backed red hair, the sides still shaven in the military fashion, but the top long enough to slick back and settle on his back a few
1550.32 1554.32 speaker2  green eyes dart around, searching for a familiar
1552.32 1594.32 speaker1  face in the curious sea of At least for now. You remember me? And you see a very, very almost impossibly skinny old man who kind of just comes hobbling over to you and he's wearing a camo fatigue vest and he's got a Vietnam veteran's cap and he just grins at you with these yellow teeth that are, you know, what's left of him and this huge, huge tobacco-stained
1592.32 1600.32 speaker2  really wanting to talk to you about
1598.32 1612.32 speaker1  since I went to space. Well, since you've seen me, I've been to space too, my friend. Really? More than once or twice have the
1610.32 1618.32 speaker3  been going on up, you know, up in the government because they don't answer my letters none.
1616.32 1636.32 speaker1  can mostly just tell you about blowing stuff up in space as far as the government's concerned. I never saw any aliens. Yeah, the official story is
1634.32 1650.32 speaker3  up with you later because I, well, have you heard from, have you heard from Trey? Trey wants to talk to you and but I think you're done with your government work.
1648.32 1658.32 speaker1  one reason I tried to move back around here was, you know, make a little money and have a little fun. That's good to
1656.32 1670.32 speaker3  Okay, well. Trey's gonna fill you in on more. Okay, I'll go find him. It was really good to see you, Beatty. I'm gonna get you to talk. I'm gonna get you to tell me about them grays.
1668.32 1678.32 speaker1  hobbles off to refill his beer. You wander off to go mingle with the rest of the party and Joe, you pull up next.
1676.32 1736.32 speaker2  standing by the keg and he's got a red solo cup full and he's got a mullet. It's a gray mullet and the front of the mullet is feathered out kind of Rod Stewart style mullet. Hell yes. And he's wearing these kind of gaudy big glasses with a gold rim around the edges. Maybe little circles embroidering the arms of the and it's a white cowboy shirt with white pearl snaps and the filigree on it is embroidered white. So it's kind of shimmers in the sun and catches shadows and it's cut off at the sleeves and he's got no shirt underneath. It's open. beer belly hanging out the front but his legs are like in skinny jeans. He's kind of like a rooster looking almost with his big belly and his swoop back hair and his rooster legs
1734.32 1744.32 speaker1  If you can
1742.32 1750.32 speaker2  ago and stuck with it.
1748.32 1754.32 speaker1  many guys that we used to see at
1752.32 1838.32 speaker2  So the camera kind of zooms in on him and he's already talking to somebody and he's I don't blame it. It's been years. I kind of keep to myself anyways. I'm back there in the laboratory. You probably sampled my Saturday morning cartoon. You probably had a taste of that SMC. That's what the kids were calling these days. People think it's called that because it makes you see Looney Tunes. it out of. I make it out of it's frosted corn flakes and milk. because it's all about the proportions of them chemicals. That's kind of the whole thing. Use chemicals. I use chemicals. Use all chemicals. It's just a matter of the proportions of them chemicals. It's just something I've always been able to tell in a person is the chemical makeups of them. Some people say I'm a genius. It'll fuck you up for sure. It's real good. Hey I'm just kind of cooped up in that lab back there. It's got a cot. It's got a real nice cot. It's one of my favorite cots. I bought it myself. Well I didn't buy myself. Ma bought it for me. But it's mine. You having a good day? Camera pans down.
1836.32 1840.32 speaker1  talking to. Yeah that's the game boy.
1838.32 1846.32 speaker2  It's a little kid. Well I'm going to go see who else
1844.32 1872.32 speaker3  Well it sounds like you really got a lot going on and I feel like there's a lot of people here and kids are really more into like TikToks and streaming content. I don't think it's like cartoons have to strictly be on like a Saturday morning anymore. You can kind of watch it at your own schedule. But it didn't really sound like you were talking about cartoons. My mom said I should meet you. I got to meet all my else's but I hope you enjoy talking to someone else. Yeah
1870.32 1876.32 speaker2  of course and if you ever want a free sample you
1874.32 1896.32 speaker1  brings us. The little boy wanders through the party with his game boy. as much as he can but he's basically relying on them to shout out to him. Pretty game boy focused otherwise. And he runs straight into the legs of... Well he'd run into
1894.32 1982.32 speaker2  that boy some harm because they are shiny these jeans. And above them a big old belt buckle. White tank top tight and tucked in under a pearl snapped unbuttoned cowboy shirt. Joni Pettymore the first is wearing some high top Nikes to bottom out that whole situation clothing wise. She's got a bleached blonde perm with super dark roots. And her eye shadow gives raccoon. Oh it's giving raccoon? upon this kid bumping into her she just pushes him away from her. Do you hear me? Oh I'm sorry Go on get running then. is a fucking wreck. you see her in the exact same outfit climbing out of a second story window and like kind of reaching out for the drain pipe on the left side and she just kind of makes a jump for it and as she's shimmying down someone's hollering
1980.32 1986.32 speaker0  What do you fucking know? Come on down
1984.32 2056.32 speaker2  dips off running off into the distance. We flash back previous to that. You see her she's going through the metal detector to get into high school and then immediately heads to the bathroom goes into one of the stalls. She's wearing the exact same outfit that I described before but she is six years younger ish and she opens up her backpack pulls out a ziplock bag that has like a is it dehydrated urine she shoves a straw into it and starts pulling on this straw like it's her job sucking down liquid in this bag and then barrel proof whiskey through that ziplock bag. She puts it back in the backpack and heads back into the high school there and as she walks through the hallway she runs into her boyfriend Jared Krinklehoff wearing a letterman's jacket and Thomas just gave me
2054.32 2060.32 speaker1  He's wearing a letterman's
2058.32 2158.32 speaker2  his arm around her and he's like Immediately is like transformed by the presence of this young man and the little love that they have and it flash forwards to her slamming a screen door the weekend I gotta go to a family function and based on the way you acted last time you're not allowed so you're gonna be here alright and she walks out the door and as she's walking out she's eyeing the muscle car that's half renovated that's what they call renovated for cars in the driveway and she pulls and she just runs it down the whole side of the car as she heads out with a screech. by herself in a car that you are considerably worried about how it's running and whether it would pass an inspection and she goes into a gas station and she steals a water bottle and as yes. Yes. She goes in to steal a water bottle but as she's heading out. on a criminology
2156.32 2166.32 speaker1  of 80.
2164.32 2182.32 speaker2  out she actually catches a glimpse up at the front of the register. There are these prepackaged bags of whiskey being sold right there at the register.
2180.32 2190.32 speaker1  six or so months now they seem pretty popular. Would you like a bag? No.
2188.32 2198.32 speaker2  want a pack of smokes. Yellows. Okay. And when he turns around she's gonna grab
2196.32 2200.32 speaker3  Actually you know what
2198.32 2208.32 speaker2  I gotta quit. I gotta quit. this time. I gotta go. Well bless
2206.32 2226.32 speaker1  your journey. 36 that's it. And then she goes to the party?
2224.32 2242.32 speaker3  Oh okay I thought maybe I was your kid but you established that you left your kid at home. You must just a lot of the women here look like you. I'll go find my mom. Thank you for talking with me.
2240.32 2250.32 speaker2  we got off to a wrong start. You gave me a scare there cause I didn't know you were gonna be in front of me when
2248.32 2266.32 speaker3  Yeah I'm a pettymore same as you.
2264.32 2316.32 speaker1  you see Arlo around the drink table. Joni I assume you might be heading the first stop traditionally. You gotta get your lubrication, get your libations and then you can talk to your god damn family right? Cause that's what family's for. older relatives you haven't seen in years and immediately around you you notice a few people. It's all kind of mysterious what exactly is going on here. Why did Ma call everybody? Kind of, you know, you've left the hauler, you've gone on to different sort of lives it kind of seems like maybe we're leaving this whole thing behind. Maybe we had finally stopped killing and dying for this way of life. Killing ourselves trying to wring a way of life out of this hauler.
2314.32 2320.32 speaker2  Oh hey Arlo how's it going? It's been a minute. Joni's been here.
2318.32 2326.32 speaker3  You still up to all the mess?
2324.32 2334.32 speaker1  The camera pans down to the five foot three uh
2332.32 2350.32 speaker2  Petey. Hey Petey. Petey this man I don't want to see you. I was just going to pick your brain about something. You reckon there's a way I could get a
2348.32 2354.32 speaker1  I mean how much you need cause uh, who's to say
2352.32 2358.32 speaker2  a drop per batch. We can send this shit into orbit right
2356.32 2366.32 speaker1  here. It's been so long since I've tried some of your, what are you calling it again?
2364.32 2370.32 speaker2  earlier who told me that they don't do that anymore.
2368.32 2408.32 speaker1  Well SMT, it's been a while since I had some of your SMT but if I can I'll do any, I got some. I took there just waiting for some kind of use and here we found it I think. to some kid who I thought could be yours
2406.32 2414.32 speaker2  Who's kid is that? Well I don't know that kid's about as, he's about
2412.32 2422.32 speaker1  who knows, probably Joni popping one out.
2420.32 2428.32 speaker2  the uh, like full blown
2426.32 2482.32 speaker1  to the groin. You can't tell if it's the same kid or not but a small slender toe headed child pops out from underneath the tablecloth on like the keg table solo cups full of beer and disappears off into a group of other kids who all just start cheering. and we used to play Tipsy? look, you're making deals for rocket fuel. What about you Joni? As far as what? Making deals, rocket fuel going to outer space like me.
2480.32 2512.32 speaker2  I guess but you know I think there's a lot of skills that I'm bringing to the table these days that could be of use to you as well. You know you're talking about maybe losing some rocket fuel you know if you need to lose something from something where you don't have the sort of connection where you can get in there I might be the kind of gal who could acquire such situations. They call you jungle style?
2510.32 2514.32 speaker1  Yes I remember that.
2512.32 2524.32 speaker2  Cause I'm in and out. Did I do it? They called you
2522.32 2540.32 speaker1  So at that moment this woman with the crazy like bleached blonde perm and electric like acid wash denim vest full like tiger leggings she runs up and she says oh my goodness
2538.32 2548.32 speaker3  all of you. It's been years since we've been together. Isn't it kind of strange though? John not being here we're on his land.
2546.32 2562.32 speaker1  the deal with that? You know he'd shoot us all. He'd shoot us all in a heartbeat. He'd shoot every last one of us. He was a shooting son of a bitch. He sure
2560.32 2576.32 speaker3  back there. one callback. That is Bonafide callback. I'm
2574.32 2586.32 speaker1  shot just would go out in public and shoot his gun in the air when he was a police
2584.32 2610.32 speaker3  I ain't wearing black you ain't wrapped up. No it's weird to
2608.32 2614.32 speaker1  missing? Sounds like they got out.
2612.32 2638.32 speaker3  their Facebooks haven't been posted on. Nobody's heard from them in the family group texts or via mail. But we hold I guess we got to hold out hope that's right that's right. I don't know if I want to hold out hope for John though because have you
2636.32 2648.32 speaker2  say that uh. I haven't
2646.32 2658.32 speaker3  said he knew that his cousin Freddie was
2656.32 2666.32 speaker1  a trash truck and they drove that trash truck all the way across the country but it got blown up.
2664.32 2676.32 speaker2  they've been around have been telling stories about lost treasures to keep themselves busy and not minding their actual capitalistic ventures.
2674.32 2700.32 speaker3  I mean but it is a good story Joni. Why are you such a downer? This is you could call me more baby. Yeah I could. Oh hell do you
2698.32 2722.32 speaker2  which has a water bottle filled just like grandma and she stabs just like a tiny pencil sized hole on the top of it and then squeeze bottles
2720.32 2728.32 speaker3  Wait did you bring more of those girls? Do you have
2726.32 2734.32 speaker2  car I guess. I could go get it.
2732.32 2738.32 speaker1  wait. Never mind. That joke
2736.32 2742.32 speaker3  There's a couple missing
2740.32 2762.32 speaker1  which means there's some you know eligible bachelors here. Oh. Steven died and I
2760.32 2764.32 speaker3  Well what about the treasure
2762.32 2768.32 speaker1  though? You know she's probably right.
2766.32 2780.32 speaker2  You know. Like if there was
2778.32 2784.32 speaker3  in the woods. I heard it got blown up in a
2782.32 2802.32 speaker1  are pressing the trash truck theory yes. Which I do admit has a ring of truth to it. It's so oddly specific. More to Arlo and hey I heard Trey might know something about this or
2800.32 2812.32 speaker3  seen Trey? I ain't seen him. Johnny. You seen Trey? Oh we were wondering where cousin Trey was
2810.32 2848.32 speaker1  She steps on your foot. she sees um what was the name of your husband? Jared. She sees like his he's ex married in. He's here for the kids. Nice. She runs up and goes uh
2846.32 2852.32 speaker2  long since I've seen you Dawn. Thank you for noticing
2850.32 2854.32 speaker1  You can't hear this. Not a day
2852.32 2860.32 speaker2  over 40. Ha! You!
2858.32 2868.32 speaker1  you know that it's gonna be maybe 30 minutes before y'all sit down to eat so you
2866.32 2878.32 speaker2  like you two are the kind of people that I was hoping to talk to about all this maybe without the addition of more people who make
2876.32 2886.32 speaker1  Ron you remember him? Yeah. He told me that Trey was looking
2884.32 2890.32 speaker3  getting in on something with Trey I'd like to get along. Oh yeah.
2888.32 2908.32 speaker1  The more the merrier and only this whoever he's already talked to. That's smart. At that moment Uncle Ron hobbles up.
2906.32 2916.32 speaker2  it's good to see that you ran into these two
2914.32 2920.32 speaker3  soon. Gotta go bye. Bye.
2918.32 2942.32 speaker1  are real. you've got an opportunity now to look around the property maybe poke around if you want to get a little frisky but you could also talk to some more people here. There's a few interesting characters that you might see around
2940.32 2950.32 speaker3  you. Maybe they're highlighted if this was a video
2948.32 2962.32 speaker1  at John's house. John was like starting his DVD collection and so he wants to go snoop around and see how big John got that collection.
2960.32 3000.32 speaker2  break break break that we need to take right now. Everyone we're gonna take a break real quick. Stand up stretch your legs go to the bathroom grab another seltzer water do whatever you need to do for fucking shout out and a happy thank you to Thomas who's fucking killing it right now. Hell yeah.
2998.32 3022.32 speaker1  Hoot and holler. to all the boys here who are killing it and Zach who's graciously playing graciously graciously pettymore
3020.32 3026.32 speaker2  episode comes out on Friday yeah okay we'll see
3024.32 3040.32 speaker1  we'll see we might be moving to a more relaxed keep that in mind
3038.32 3054.32 speaker2  we'll see Maxine your mother my parents Don and Han
3052.32 3084.32 speaker1  I named Maxine moments before I invented her but then we ran with the fact that she was your mom I like to go to court
3082.32 3088.32 speaker3  Trey is a little bit younger
3086.32 3112.32 speaker1  John who was 26 at the time of his disappearance and your generation so he's in like you were the object of like his charm and his magnetism he lit up the whole world it sounds like Jesus everybody loves this kid
3110.32 3118.32 speaker3  don't spoil my Christ narrative
3116.32 3122.32 speaker2  narrative some of you
3120.32 3168.32 speaker1  that Trey wanted you might have seen a different decline of Pettymore Holler he in fact is one of the original you know when he does it'll probably be pretty loud inside the house to check on John's DVD collection in the kitchen cooking food and getting things ready there's a lot of hustle and bustle and you get caught up for a minute as people are saying
3166.32 3182.32 speaker3  I haven't seen you in years what are you doing? what's your spice? I'm crying I'm crying I'm actually
3180.32 3212.32 speaker1  which is eerily quiet considering house besides the kitchen because it's exactly as John left it in the living room you see the DVD collection the shelf that they're on at one point all of them are there but Petey the first time you saw it you were amazed it was the most organized thing in John's house and now you see it's kind of been hastily shoved back on you know Smokey 3 before Smokey 2
3210.32 3218.32 speaker2  what? that's embarrassing
3216.32 3296.32 speaker1  is that you can see a lot of bullet holes in the ceiling and the couch is covered in drywall debris and some foam insulation from the attic that's wafted down through the bullet holes quick sorry not insulation popcorn actual popcorn leaking out of a little plastic bag and you remember that John used to take home the huge plastic bags of popcorn that they stocked concession stands with at the Raceway and he he filled his attic with that to use as insulation and it's cold in here because the squirrels have eaten most of his popcorn DVD collection and is just a little sad looking at it thinking about John but also just sad that it's not as perfect as he remembered but he kind of fixes it up a little bit and then from the inside of his jumper pulls out a signed he has signed a copy of Space Cowboys and then slips it in alphabetically where it should go so in between Space Cowboys and Space Cowboys director cut
3294.32 3300.32 speaker3  one regular Space Cowboys
3298.32 3302.32 speaker1  astronaut right very cool
3300.32 3304.32 speaker3  Peter you probably would have been
3302.32 3334.32 speaker1  someone you wish John had looked up to I think you probably tried to put him on the straight and narrow with hard work and dedication you can join the Air Force get through Air Force Academy go to the become an astronaut and John thought it was cool that you were an astronaut but he thought it was a lot cooler that Trey had a dope car in the fact knowing that John also wore blue though just like Pete
3332.32 3338.32 speaker2  well the cop in the
3336.32 3344.32 speaker1  even if they didn't wear blue you know they're wearing blue
3342.32 3350.32 speaker2  because then when Clark changed into the 70's CPD uniform
3348.32 3356.32 speaker1  so yeah they both wore blue
3354.32 3368.32 speaker2  not his cop
3366.32 3390.32 speaker1  sticks it in there looks back and is thinking like you know maybe if we find him we can set him set him straight wind through the bullet holes in the attic you just hear a it sounds like a comforting sigh and you think maybe somewhere John would like what I just did with his DVDs
3388.32 3394.32 speaker3  over there Petey I was just fixing them they're
3392.32 3404.32 speaker1  John we'll write that one down as maybe he did go missing and didn't run away
3402.32 3426.32 speaker2  not there because while Jon is family Joni's a thief and right now she's very much interested in one thing and that is getting an undershirt of John's that has that manly manly smell on it that she can put in her car to piss off Jared later
3424.32 3462.32 speaker1  Joni as you head back to the bedroom to the bad room on what time of day it is sometimes after a night a night of Miller lights and beer pretzels the bathroom's the bad room bedroom a number of
3460.32 3464.32 speaker3  a few of you and John
3462.32 3478.32 speaker1  he was about three years older for cousin friends but older enough to be cool
3476.32 3488.32 speaker2  can't afford a cool car dated a guy with a cool car cause he had a cool car when you say you want a cool car
3486.32 3496.32 speaker1  ooh can I catch it dexterity or athletics
3494.32 3508.32 speaker2  that's a 40 on an 85 dexterity you catch it it says my distinguishing feature is wiry like a live wire like a live wire wire like a live wire
3506.32 3524.32 speaker1  you can feel the back of the frame feels a little weird it's kind of bulging out like there's something stuck back there looking back in the picture there's something stuck between the picture itself and the backing
3522.32 3542.32 speaker2  around the back edge of it which is easy cause only two of them are holding the whole thing on and she kind of slides it out what's back there big
3540.32 3580.32 speaker1  I thought you might be one of the ones who could seek out some of these clues that I've left behind here's the deal Joni I came into a treasure and I don't know if I'm going to be able to enjoy it in this life so I want my family at least whoever in my family deserves it and aside from my clues it might be you and you know any team you might assemble ocean style to aid you in this process oceans 12
3578.32 3590.32 speaker3  yeah or it's the world's greatest clue
3588.32 3594.32 speaker2  what coordinates are
3592.32 3636.32 speaker1  you Joni you reminded me of myself she's in the bathroom at the door shut there were certain things one of the sentences I'm riffing this all uh about Smokey and the bandit one thing find that thing and you'll find your next clue and you remember you guys always just talked about how fucking sweet it would be to have the uh 77 black Trans Am is that a thing? yeah of course it is I'm Jon talking to you in this letter I know what car my dad drives stupid
3634.32 3644.32 speaker2  the baby uh fuck yeah in the back of that 77
3642.32 3648.32 speaker1  or your team again if you have assembled one who finds my treasure
3646.32 3654.32 speaker2  absolutely not just me
3652.32 3666.32 speaker1  on this property the clue after that is gonna be harder good luck you see actually a lot of them are bulging
3664.32 3668.32 speaker2  I grab all of those
3666.32 3688.32 speaker1  they're not coming off uh fuck unnatural yeah that's a fail 92 Peter naturally good at attaching pictures to walls it looks like it's just should be just a simple wire but try as you might you can't get any of the other pictures to come off
3686.32 3700.32 speaker3  the wall and you see one um about? and you
3698.32 3720.32 speaker1  around with a DVD he's decided that it would be a good ambiance to have smoking the bandit on in the background hallway and if Arlo follows
3718.32 3726.32 speaker3  trip down memory lane?
3724.32 3732.32 speaker1  take a sanity roll for me
3730.32 3738.32 speaker2  45 it's not right it ain't right it's not right
3736.32 3748.32 speaker1  but nobody's better than Joni no fucking wall is gonna keep these pictures on here if you want them so why can this wall not
3746.32 3760.32 speaker2  try to take that picture off this wall look at this look at this and she's like grabbing onto it and she's gonna try to like put her feet up on the wall to show that it's really
3758.32 3772.32 speaker1  as Arlo and Peter walk in and look at this plops off the wall
3770.32 3778.32 speaker3  can I try to catch it?
3776.32 3812.32 speaker1  athletics or dexterity I got an 88 on a 70 the picture shatters fuck it was a really nice frame it's broken fuck and Peter the glass is poked right through your face ruining forever as far as you know the only copy of a pretty nice picture of the four of you
3810.32 3814.32 speaker3  yeah and you cut
3812.32 3820.32 speaker1  I thought you made my real face and you slice your finger take a D4 of damage
3818.32 3824.32 speaker2  Petey
3822.32 3832.32 speaker1  I slice from like pointer finger down to below my
3830.32 3846.32 speaker2  blood splatters the ceiling can I try to first aid myself?
3844.32 3850.32 speaker3  I got you Petey you know that's the thing
3848.32 3856.32 speaker2  37 on a 50 for first aid I cannot do blood
3854.32 3870.32 speaker3  give me a second he pulls out a bandana out of his back pocket and just wraps it around there real tight he knows where to stomps the bleeding just right that's not gonna feel good for a while but you'll be alright
3868.32 3912.32 speaker1  amongst the shattered glass? there's blood everywhere but um but Arlo is able before it just gets like fire hosed with your blood spray to nimbly grab a note that's in there and it's essentially the exact same note as before it says hey Arlo, Peter, and Joni what do I lose? uh just one
3910.32 3914.32 speaker2  it comes out at the bottom like
3912.32 3954.32 speaker3  Joni is this what you're talking about? but if this picture came off the wall it means all of you are here god dammit I couldn't happen to know who might stumble into my house or why I figured you might try to rob me the smarts, know how, gumption and the character remember when we all used to watch Smokey and the Bandit
3952.32 3958.32 speaker1  didn't his daddy have one of those?
3956.32 3968.32 speaker2  disappeared and then that car went missing shortly thereafter
3966.32 3988.32 speaker3  treasure treasure treasure treasure series of clues good luck to y'all I love you lots
3986.32 4034.32 speaker1  through those holes hey Arlo you know there's nothing up there but stars right? I just farted and Peter thinks about the time spent piloting jets and stuff and that was heaven we gotta do something let's go you know where you said it got lost I bet she does I didn't remember that John's dad had that car
4032.32 4050.32 speaker2  it is pretty cool that he did well if that car got stolen
4048.32 4056.32 speaker1  you flip the note over
4054.32 4062.32 speaker3  by the way I know my dad had a cherry but that's not the car I'm thinking of
4060.32 4080.32 speaker2  his was black his daddy had a black one the one from the show was cherry and is it a movie?
4078.32 4088.32 speaker3  little Joni I thought somebody would teach you more about cars
4086.32 4094.32 speaker2  I haven't seen it
4092.32 4100.32 speaker3  I was looking at my phone
4098.32 4104.32 speaker2  waiting for Jared to call
4102.32 4140.32 speaker1  can I go over and look at the DVD's and search that a 40 for search yeah you know that there's no clue in the DVD's you open them up and they're all smashed except one does have it says go back to the hallway what do you think is going to happen there? you want to edit?
4138.32 4142.32 speaker2  coming down the line?
4140.32 4172.32 speaker1  I mean we're like 20 minutes from it I'm the DM you pick one of those letters back up you keep reading the back it says I'm not talking about my dad's cherry trans am with a sweet
4170.32 4184.32 speaker3  why don't you go take a look at it why don't you go take a look at it why don't you go take a look at it
4182.32 4186.32 speaker2  Ma's speech
4184.32 4204.32 speaker1  you hear a dinner bell a big loud dinner bell and Ma Pettymore you hear a voice in the distance say
4202.32 4210.32 speaker3  Pete runs
4208.32 4214.32 speaker1  wherever the fuck you want to sit do you sit together
4212.32 4226.32 speaker2  Joni just has a cigarette hanging out of her mouth unlit normally Arlo sits at the kids table he's done it all his life
4224.32 4228.32 speaker3  this time he's kind of
4226.32 4248.32 speaker2  like you're gonna go sit over there Joni who's 24 and just started sitting at the adults table no didn't even sit at the adults table the last time she was here five years ago Arlo
4246.32 4276.32 speaker1  I've got a little flow chart here and if at the start of this whole cookout you had decided not to mingle or investigate Jon's place and instead just be dicks you would have been sent to the kitty table we would have heard mom's speech about 45 minutes ago
4274.32 4282.32 speaker3  here you go Arlo and I pulled the chair out for him much obliged
4280.32 4320.32 speaker1  everybody's sitting down too there are two huge long tables that stretch almost as wide as Jon's barn which they're in front of and Ma, it's her 70th birthday she kind of comes out from the kitchen wearing a long white dress and she's beaming she's smiling to everyone she shakes some hands she hugs the little children and two or three of them follow her as she goes and sits down at the table and she raises a glass and she says please, please, everyone, everyone be seated
4318.32 4332.32 speaker2  and as everyone sits down do we all roll for our anti
4330.32 4404.32 speaker1  yeah, if you get told by we can make this a mechanic actually if you get told by a person in authority to do something even even if you want to do it, you're going to have to roll against your oppositional defiance which we're going to say means Joni you're going to have to beat a 40 or above on all oppositional defiance I have to roll above? I don't know how you want to do it I have a 60% chance of not doing it yes, you two have a 60% chance Pettymore's heart for Ma, who is not thank god man's authority, she is as far as you're all concerned a direct agent of the Lord like, this is this is the mouthpiece of the universe as far as you guys are mostly raised to be concerned and she's currently beaming and she's tapping her glass thank you, thank you all so much
4402.32 4410.32 speaker3  on my birthday
