0.00 21.96 speaker0  Welcome, my sour-creamy children. It's your yogurt craftsman, Wolf the Dog, and I'm here to leave out all the cream until it becomes art.
16.32 34.84 speaker1  I'm about to flood this farmer's market with that thick, nasty artisanal cream.
28.24 183.80 speaker0  the only yogurt creamery and, uh, radio station, I think. He writes, No ooze is good ooze. And all dogs go to heaven. Things fell apart. The sinner couldn't hold. The Stygian tide is loosed and everywhere. The ceremony of innocence is overcome. And what eldritch beast? It's our come round at last. Slouches toward contention to be born? Shout out to Irish Chris and Elena the Good Witch of the Midwest. Season one has been squamously good. Thanks for all the creepin' terror, PTB crew. Damn Van Gogh's ear. That's awesome for you, I bet. It was mainly just the letter E, but they got what I was puttin' down. Only a very small percentage of them actually do. Weird, right? If you wanna write up somethin' like Van Gogh's ear here, If I had a YouTube, I'd definitely look at it. So what I need y'all to do is to look at it and then share it with all your internet buddies.
180.44 195.24 speaker1  After y'all caught up with the creature crew,
190.92 205.32 speaker0  For the conclusion of the mission in Moja. Apparently that's a place where spooky things can happen, but y'all gotta check the Patreon to find that out.
202.48 215.60 speaker1  Are there links for all that sloppin' more? Why, yes. Where are they?
213.52 317.28 speaker0  Do it for Wolfie, my babies. I'm makin' puppy dog eyes at ya. And now I'm doin' this for y'all. It's the gosh dang news. Last time, I gave over the power, relinquished the duty, forwent the honor of presenting the news. But this time, you know what's goin' on. Took out the horde of incoming goo-drenched snatchy skeletons, and turned it into a curveball-gotcha-tongue situation. You're sweet and sourly mistaken if you're lookin' for Dragon in 2. This is Dragon in 3 with What Kind of World Are You Livin' In? Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline, leavin' my mind at your altar, crossin' the double line, doin' it every time.
312.28 328.28 speaker2  It's Nick Meckles and I'm here with my brother, Nick Meckles!
327.28 337.28 speaker3  I need to be amped up. Justin, Justin, he's our man. If he can't do it, no one can.
336.28 360.28 speaker2  It's Nick Meckles time! Round three and we're at the top of this, motherfucker.
357.28 368.28 speaker3  I guess, are we at like a little television desk?
366.28 376.28 speaker2  I've got one microphone in his face, you've got the other microphone in his face, which means that we have four microphones between the two of us. That's quite amazing.
374.28 382.28 speaker3  I love that we found these extra microphones in this extra dimensional plane.
380.28 406.28 speaker2  and we're gonna go right to the business! Do you see the big, gigantic, Planet Juggernaut's got his tongue swinging around like Luke Skywalker in Empire Strikes Back. I do see that. Well, that guy is right up there!
403.28 415.28 speaker3  The Gigant Umbropithecus reaches down
413.28 577.28 speaker2  Am I using that right? At the... Yeah! And so another chunk of this crooning group of chanters. Zach, it would be really asinine to stop you right now I like learning, and this is a illuminated land, into the forearm of this enormous beast as it swipes across at this group. And I was thinking about it, and I thought, you know, we already rolled for, gosh, so many people. We rolled for the Old West people. Oh! We rolled for Councilwoman Carrie Pages. We rolled for Harry Clinker, Everett Pace, Mildred Mitchell, Gary Daley, Jimmy Sanders, Professor Horace Green. We rolled for a lot of people as well as a lot of pets. And to put you guys through that again, I thought might be super duper fun. as this enormous towering beast that's just oozing, forming and reforming its tongue, hanging out with Planet Juggernaut at the end of this black ooze that it's held onto. It swings around him. And because Planet Juggernaut has this thing's tongue, we're gonna take a negative 20%. This thing will take a negative 20%. So this time, we're gonna roll for some more NPCs, whether or not they live or whether or not they will be consumed, and they each have a good 30% chance of non-existence, which means a 70% chance of survival, which is big. So I will start. I will go ahead and roll the first one because we have just enough NPCs left for everyone to have their own to roll for. So I'm gonna start with Greer Hilfintop Kermunker now. dressed like she's in the Old West still. She's got just insanely strong thighs. And when you look at the thighs, you think to yourself- Yep. 100%. And shout out to M from Michigan for giving us this NPC- To maybe murder. $10 level on Patreon. You can write up an NPC. They will kill. Yeah. So if it is a 30 or under- They die?
576.28 580.28 speaker3  Yep. 95. Safe.
579.28 608.28 speaker2  Sweet life. Thomas, I need you to roll as we see the janitor of the First Church of Contention. He has a pencil-thin mustache and a mullet. Casey Kristoff. His beard gut is spilling out of his Van Halen t-shirt all over his cutoff shorts, his outfit of choice for the past 30 years, and he is missing a hand.
604.28 613.28 speaker3  is a disgusting and amazing description.
611.28 621.28 speaker2  I am, and you are, and we are, to B. Weldon from Salt Lake City, who wrote up Casey Kristoff for us.
620.28 625.28 speaker3  To 100? Yep.
622.28 663.28 speaker2  Thomas, 30 or under, and he gone. 42. He has dirty overalls and boots, a trucker cap with long, oily hair flowing out the bottom of it, and a lip packed with chew, the scent of booze on his breath, oil-stained hands, and a ripped flannel. You got your $3 back from Terence Liquor. Yep. Now let's see. I hope he dies. Oh!
661.28 666.28 speaker3  It's a 29.
663.28 701.28 speaker2  It's a 29 as Terence Liquor looks up at the very end of his life. Literally, in my imagination, the ooze must have taken him as he was still just laying in the yard of Randy Yanks, and so he has almost no time to come to his senses here in this dark, luminous, landed plane of existence. He had a bad day. as he dissipates into the arm ooze of this gigantic umbropithecus.
700.28 707.28 speaker3  Yeah. If I had to guess.
704.28 735.28 speaker2  Shout-out to B. Crever for that lost life. Thank you for making Terence Liquor. from the city, and she has a large tortoiseshell glasses, a full-sleeve tattoo of a robed figure holding a ball of light on her left arm, and she always wears blood-red lipstick. That's right, it's Clara Blankenship.
733.28 739.28 speaker3  and she told us about a dream she'd had. Yes.
736.28 744.28 speaker2  Yes, and shout-out to Annie B.
743.28 745.28 speaker3  Oh!
744.28 787.28 speaker2  It's a 45. Oh, my God, that was close. Annie, she is okay. Shout-out to Sarah from Philadelphia. Just go ahead and roll over 30 for Archie and Taco. Archie and Taco, two dogs to help fight the black ooze with the Contention Creek Critter Coalition. Archie is a white lab mix, and Taco is a Shetland sheepdog. And then in parentheses, Sarah from Philadelphia has written, Just please don't kill my pups. Oh! Hey! Hey, Liv.
786.28 790.28 speaker3  Wait, could you see that? I did, yes. Oh, nice.
789.28 807.28 speaker2  Yeah, that worked. Oh, wow, that was a really, this thing is clearly off its balance. It does not know. Yeah. I mean, it was rough. Tear of Slicker.
805.28 809.28 speaker3  Yeah, we did miss one, yep.
807.28 818.28 speaker2  Literally, the people who are chanting have noticed Tear of Slicker's lack of involvement in the chant, and they just kind of pushed him
815.28 836.28 speaker3  a little bit more towards the edge of the crowd. And even that, I think, by the tongue Skywalker situation. and just unfortunately a huge drop of its ooze just smothered Tear of Slicker, like would pacify.
835.28 850.28 speaker2  That's perfect. And if it weren't for that Planet Juggernaut movement with the negative 20%, I think we would have lost a few more. Almost all of them, I think.
847.28 857.28 speaker3  We hit a 42 and a 46. Now he's just bragging about how fucking cool
854.28 867.28 speaker2  No, I'm just bragging about how lucky our roles were. Immediately, Rosemary, M-A-R-Y, removes itself from Rosemary. Can we roll to see if she got hit by the Gigantombropithecus?
866.28 886.28 speaker3  Oh yeah, sure, I'll just roll.
881.28 988.28 speaker2  up out of the face and back of the neck of Rosemary. Upon seeing John Ball... Filling her hole with the world. That's right. Upon seeing this competition, she's going to give it a bit more oomph so she removes all of her tendrils from the back of Rosemary. And so she plugs all of her tendrils down into the hole, the portal, that she is trying to open in an attempt to focus more of her energy to combat the situation that John Ball is making happen. However, with this, she is leaving herself open and defenseless. So I am not going to roll a dodge roll for her this round, and any combat directed at her will be unopposed as she is going to attempt to bring some sort of creature from the other side, which we can already kind of see through this weird haze, this veil, and just barely, we can all make out with skin so thin, her bones protrude into view. Bruises and lesions cover her body. But even through the hideous transformation, you recognize Mildred's granddaughter. And with pure hatred in her eyes,
986.28 995.28 speaker3  We couldn't hear you. I just saw the face.
991.28 1036.28 speaker2  from the manipulating activator robot Y, and you all hear or feel a soft voice around you. Silas Cole, the fool who brought me into his existence and then left me out of all his plans, and he finally told me where he kept her, for well over a century. You, uncaring meat vessels, disgust me.
1034.28 1044.28 speaker3  a problem with Silas. That's Keith. Go get him.
1040.28 1080.28 speaker2  And John Paul says this to M-A-R-Y, and the camera does a whip pan over to Keith, who is in between two very, very interested announcers who have microphones shoved into his face, but they suddenly are joined by another figure who is a tall, gaunt, translucently skinned figure in a large, black suit and black tie, and it just sort of appears in front of this Keith Vigna, who is on his knees, crying into the luminous land below.
1078.28 1087.28 speaker3  I bet they'll make for a really good interview.
1084.28 1099.28 speaker2  and reaches out its two hands, each with a McFlurry. Yes.
1098.28 1106.28 speaker3  Oh.
1102.28 1111.28 speaker2  I believe you requested these!
1108.28 1124.28 speaker3  and sees the Oreo one, takes a little bite, and then he looks around for Don, because he needs to deliver this M&M McFlurry.
1119.28 1129.28 speaker2  When you look around, you find Don as...
1127.28 1138.28 speaker3  than you left him?
1134.28 1160.28 speaker2  One of these balls has made him into a leg of a sort of three-part operation, Don being one leg, John being another leg, and a ball floating atop in between them. But also, Don seems to, from this perspective, have full control over what he says and does.
1159.28 1186.28 speaker3  Yeah, essentially. and below your nephew's ball. Your nephew, but the body of your brother. Oh, right, yeah. Next to your brother, nephew, which isn't the first time somebody's had to be called that in the Pettymore family.
1185.28 1214.28 speaker2  That's right. And we'll post that on the social media Yes.
1212.28 1220.28 speaker3  It seems like maybe you just kind of blipped into existence here. Can you take me over to them?
1218.28 1225.28 speaker2  Okay.
1222.28 1236.28 speaker3  just silently look at him, looking him up and down, and I just hop on his back, like piggyback.
1234.28 1271.28 speaker2  and you move there at an absurd rate that you haven't felt really since this thing clearly moved from on top of one of the mausoleums in the city cemetery to you to put its hand directly around your neck. That was the last time that you felt this movement, but this time you're a part of it. And then you're standing in front of this AT-ST that is already you guys practicing.
1267.28 1275.28 speaker3  and is like, hey, and he holds up the M&M McFlurry and looks at Don.
1273.28 1280.28 speaker1  I try to slap it out of his hand.
1278.28 1286.28 speaker2  This ain't the time for a McFlurry boy.
1282.28 1312.28 speaker3  Uh, Don. Hey, Avigna, if you're just passing out McFlurries and you don't want one, I'll take that McFlurry right now. He switches his hand over like a foot and offers it to you. John hanging there, he doesn't reach out for it. He just extends his neck a little bit
1310.28 1319.28 speaker1  but my hands are barely moving. You're swinging your torso
1318.28 1334.28 speaker3  and the noodle arms are going with it. I'm like, what about the other thing I asked for?
1332.28 1434.28 speaker2  and about half of these creatures stare directly into the portal that is currently being attempted and the other half looks directly at the beast, this enormous, lumbering, dripping, forming and reforming Gigant Umbropithecus. So the first half is going to attempt to help close the portal. to keep it from moving again, and that is a success. So that is going to hinder the Gigant Umbropithecus further. And so you see about half of these little Myriad fuckers and try to put their hands out toward the portal but nothing seems to be happening as the MARY manipulating activator robot Y of making this portal appear. And the other half do reach out their hands and the beast that is off kilter already, they seem to be helping the momentum of Planet Juggernaut in whatever it's trying to do. So that'll make it easier for Planet Juggernaut in the future. And with that, it is the end of Myriad's turn and the beginning of the turn of the Overseer.
1430.28 1452.28 speaker3  His focus is on Gigantupipidogum. His goal, he saw Juggernaut bringing the tongue around the legs. He wants it to fall down.
1451.28 1456.28 speaker2  Sure. Do you have a thing?
1454.28 1465.28 speaker3  Well, I could... You know when a guy kneels down behind a guy and then he's stumbling back behind him? That's what I was going to pick.
1464.28 1470.28 speaker2  Yeah, tabletop.
1469.28 1529.28 speaker3  It's a tabletop game. I think Overseer... We just saw that Clark can do the light thing, so we're going to let Clark startle it, and we're going to have the Overseer bringing that tube down behind it. That is a success. and he's holding a giant ball of light. It's a flashbang of magic.
1526.28 1544.28 speaker1  Zach and I made the exact same sound.
1542.28 1580.28 speaker3  we'll all start sealing, is what we'll call it, I know. I've been taking lessons. Oh, we should have been taking improv lessons, bud. And it's Clark Bishop.
1579.28 1583.28 speaker2  Complete the plan.
1582.28 1590.28 speaker3  I pass. It's a 24 on a 64.
1587.28 1593.28 speaker2  and so now you have a split second
1592.28 1630.28 speaker3  Clark has seen the plan. He knows the plan. It was a plan before he even knew it was a plan, and his hand stretches out toward that thing that he had previously fucked up. He let this thing out of that tube, so he's like, I got to... This is poetic justice here is what's happening, and he just whips his hand. Whips his hand. It's a magical flourish of a hand whip. As quick as somebody can turn their wrist, that thing flies from where it was right down behind it. So rad. Oh.
1627.28 1644.28 speaker2  and as with all large, large creatures, it's basically in slow motion as it's just like, oh.
1639.28 1666.28 speaker3  all blow at once?
1663.28 1712.28 speaker2  The Gigantover Vivigus, stories tall, or why it's taking over your town, the town of contention, for this entire time, You're never quite sure exactly where it is, but in this moment, you do know that it can no longer stand, and it is now falling backwards, having been table-topped by its former prison.
1710.28 1733.28 speaker3  I got to say, I'm really enjoying this McFlurry. I thought we were maybe more needed in this fight, but it looks like that thing's fallen over. Do you want to just share this McFlurry right here? But as Kevin says that, the ball runs off with you towards the fight.
1732.28 1737.28 speaker1  Yes. You're bumping everybody.
1735.28 1756.28 speaker3  You're just passengers now, and everybody's shaking really hard, and you can see a lot of... We got the Butterfinger? M&M. M&M. You can see M&M's and McFlurry kind of chunking out, but your brother, nephew, unsteadily passes it over to you as best as he can.
1753.28 1763.28 speaker2  wet M&M's that are melting their colors Cool.
1761.28 1779.28 speaker3  Yeah, roll to taste that. It's only a 40, so... What'd you get?
1778.28 1785.28 speaker1  That's a long bit. Yeah, I got a 29 on taste, so what does that do, Zach?
1783.28 1792.28 speaker2  Let me get inside your mouth real quick. That means you get to taste it. It just...
1790.28 1805.28 speaker1  Who don't like a McFlurry?
1803.28 1810.28 speaker3  seemingly, so that's probably a lot of things he hasn't gotten to enjoy besides just dairy. Uh-huh.
1808.28 1817.28 speaker2  What's next on the agenda? Cheese?
1815.28 1820.28 speaker1  Everybody's still really shaken
1817.28 1838.28 speaker3  as this ball ATSD runs towards the fray, but after Kevin John sees that Don succeeded on his roll and got a good taste of this McFlurry,
1836.28 1843.28 speaker1  possibly three.
1841.28 1864.28 speaker3  and it looks like he's thinking, and next to you from your ball leg, another tendril shoots out, and out of it is you would swear a Harry Potter wand made out of tendrils. And it's kind of like it taps you on the shoulder,
1861.28 1870.28 speaker1  with my weird limp arms and body.
1868.28 1873.28 speaker2  Yeah, yeah, so you try to grab it,
1870.28 1881.28 speaker3  and when you can't, the tendril that's got your arm kind of lifts your arm up to it. It's like a ventriloquist grabbing the dummy's hand
1878.28 1900.28 speaker2  and then, like, using it like, Now you're grasping this thing's wand. Now, see, that's interesting,
1898.28 1925.28 speaker3  that doesn't seem super phallic, but when you said when you're grasping this thing's wand, all I could think of was a dick, so... Okay. but then as soon as you said wand out loud, I was like, yeah, that sounds like a fucking cock. So you grab the magic rod. What do you want me to do, boy?
1924.28 1931.28 speaker1  We're gonna get into it.
1927.28 1955.28 speaker3  We're gonna add some petty more unpredictability to this fight, but I feel through my ball bones that you might be able to attenuate to that little cock-like object you have in your hand. Hopefully it will amplify and target your magic towards our enemies.
1954.28 1961.28 speaker1  It's a lot of card tricks. It's a lot of card tricks.
1960.28 1963.28 speaker3  Mostly street magic.
1962.28 1966.28 speaker1  Yes.
1965.28 1973.28 speaker3  It's a lot of hand.
1971.28 1990.28 speaker1  Well, I guess I'm seeing everyone run towards the Gigantum umbripithecus. Nailed it. You got it. And I'm gonna use devil hands, but extend the range out with the magic wand. Yeah. I'm like, boy, you're about to see the best devil hands you done ever seen.
1989.28 1994.28 speaker0  Who are you devil-handsing?
1993.28 1998.28 speaker1  Did you say it again?
1996.28 2010.28 speaker3  you're about to see the best devil hands you've ever seen. Kevin John shrinks away from you because that was another name for Uncle Slaps. I just reach over and slap you.
2009.28 2028.28 speaker2  Yeah. It's hard to be a petty more. And so when you devil hands this thing, I need you to roll an unnatural.
2026.28 2041.28 speaker1  You have unnatural memorized? Well, I'm DM. Step DM, what are you doing?
2039.28 2053.28 speaker3  just maybe not in that context.
2052.28 2093.28 speaker2  I mean, I was about to describe the magic coming out the tip, so I thought I was- Stepkeeper, what are you doing? and the vector that is Baal come together to form this unholy trinity of both of them, and it just fires out. I mean, you all see the first massive amount of color you've seen in this world that isn't just technicolor. What color is devil hands?
2090.28 2108.28 speaker1  In my mind, I thought of holding the wand, like my entire arm starts just glowing orange-red and charging up, basically,
2107.28 2120.28 speaker3  Step Uncle.
2116.28 2157.28 speaker2  is now blasting in the middle of its body, which literally starts to unform at the center, and the bolt of energy, this unnatural energy, just goes rocketing through it, but the thing is at an angle to where it's coming in at the belly button area, and it's blasting out the back of this thing's head, and it's just falling to the ground, and you hear this massive roar.
2155.28 2177.28 speaker3  If Don were to look over, he's not because he's concentrated on making the spell happen. is turning into that technicolor muck one bit at a time. It's flowing from the leg with Kevin Don
2173.28 2290.28 speaker2  into your wand, out of the bag. that is connected and blasting through is encircled. Spiraling technicolor energy surrounds the crimson-red firebolt, and when it connects to the Gigantum Barpithecus already on its way down, the crimson-red and technicolor stream begins making its way throughout the entirety of the existence of this enormous, unnatural creature, and then the entirety of this forming and reforming structural beast, this huge presence of this world that has been feared by everyone who's been here for as long as they can remember, it just dissipates. And then, like a bomb, the spot erupts and technicolor shockwaves, with hues of red breaking up every color between them, send everyone huddling to the ground The Gigantum Barpithecus is no more. and a whole lotta Mary. to assist you in closing this portal. However... They've failed. They've failed.
2286.28 2320.28 speaker3  and a lot of them wind up on their ass with the shockwave. John shoots out impossibly long tendrils on either side that kind of literally just throw every Myriad who fell on their ass from the shockwave. He just scoops them into the hole and tosses them on in there. Yeah. Nice. Holy shit. We might need those guys, though.
2319.28 2344.28 speaker2  All right, go ahead and roll. Unnatural. Myriad rolled 100 in order to keep themselves from being used in this way. It's a critical fail?
2343.28 2356.28 speaker3  It's the most critical fail.
2352.28 2414.28 speaker2  and throw themselves onto the pile as well, and these are ones who were trying to help and kept their feet under them, but they throw themselves at the mercy of this John Ball creature who clearly knows what he's doing, and these things know that a portal shouldn't be open, and some of them are even yelling out. You see them communicating with each other, and one is like, Yes! Yes! Yes! The plane! The plane! It's unstable! Close the portal! Some of them look down, though, and you see, Let's roll Humant, but it'll be at a negative 20. Everyone, go ahead and roll Humant, but at a negative 20.
2413.28 2439.28 speaker3  Hey! Should I roll for both, Keith? No, it's not going to be the one that's up another one.
2436.28 2489.28 speaker2  turns and sees these myriad creatures, and the ones who are blocking themselves over this portal, and they're looking down, and you see on their faces. From the portal? and they're all very aware of how thin all of their skin is, and how none of them have nails, and they're having this weird crisis moment. I didn't put two and two together in time just now.
2488.28 2515.28 speaker3  Keith. eternal life, which made her fingernails pop off, and her skin very thin, and her hair fall out. Holy shit! One of the Keiths didn't have fingernails either.
2513.28 2525.28 speaker2  Might have sent the wrong thing into that portal. Wait.
2523.28 2612.28 speaker3  but what does that make Marvin? Were they part of the transformation? They're a lesser of the Myriads? You're looking at me and not Zach, which is insane right now. I'm sure he didn't. They don't even need human speech and all that. That could be. though, and Marvin had a lot more of his own agency. I don't know. For sure. Marvin was like a crime lord.
2610.28 2619.28 speaker1  They say things in numbers.
2615.28 2638.28 speaker3  and sees Tildi and sees them and starts thinking about it, he just walks over to the pile. Yeah. Did I do that?
2637.28 2644.28 speaker1  Oh, man.
2641.28 2667.28 speaker3  when he's looking at me?
2665.28 2772.28 speaker2  They're rising out of the water. They're tube-like, covered in squamous black partially translucent membranes. Their bodies segmented as toxically green pulsating arteries and veins can be seen through their thin-looking exterior. They have no identifiable eyes or nose. Their cavernous, circular mouths, one sitting just inside the other, are lined with hooked teeth. And from these maws, sharp stylets protrude And you look down at the door-sized chunk of frozen worm keeping you afloat. And as your eyes refocus on the darkness of the cold ocean around you, This ocean is made of absolutely zero water. It is not ooze, either. This upside-down ceiling slowly lowering down toward the battlefield below That's why the waves crash in irregular patterns and why being submerged has a strange sort of pressure, tightness, that doesn't happen in water. And these things begin crawling up your legs.
2766.28 2809.28 speaker3  and spots a worm not too far from his frozen door worm. and there's like a little hole in the middle of it. He takes his pants off and shakes off the worms and feeds one of his legs of his pants through that hole, and then he jumps at the nearest worm with the intent of stabbing this saw near the front towards the teeth, jumps over and tries to stick it in. I got a 4.
2808.28 2823.28 speaker1  I do.
2819.28 2875.28 speaker2  through this circular saw, these worms are climbing you. As soon as your pants are off, these things are climbing your legs and you realize that when they're climbing, it's not individual ones getting any higher on you. They're just sucking their little circular mouths, hooking into your skin, and then the next one is just somehow crawling up on top of that one, and it sucks onto you a little bit higher, and then the next one, just these things running up your leg, and your legs are just completely covered in these tiny little mouths that are chunking out bits of your skin and sending you mentally to a completely different place as you take six damage.
2874.28 2879.28 speaker3  Is this your main, Keith?
2877.28 2883.28 speaker2  So it was full health, right?
2881.28 2909.28 speaker1  Didn't we start that fight really low?
2906.28 2922.28 speaker3  and I use the circular saw to cut my legs off so that I can get away from the worms and fly towards the other worms. My God.
2920.28 2926.28 speaker2  and so this circular saw just...
2924.28 2927.28 speaker3  after you go through that femoral artery.
2926.28 2944.28 speaker2  No, we're going to go ahead, and it's a whole new kind of samurai move that you've invented here of taking a circular saw through the thigh in order to... Die?
2943.28 2949.28 speaker1  God dammit.
2944.28 2954.28 speaker3  Or the Cubs announcer.
2951.28 2957.28 speaker1  Oh my God, why do we think about that?
2956.28 3004.28 speaker2  That was Nick Nichols. I know. What's Harry Caray sound like?
2999.28 3026.28 speaker3  around the Gigantopropithecus when the rest of team good guy, we think, baby, team our world, really stepped up and knocked that fucker out. So Planet Juggernaut kind of sees this and starts swinging back around. He adjusts his path, and he's heading towards Mary in the portal.
3024.28 3033.28 speaker2  So go ahead and roll. I think we can make this happen this turn. Oh, right.
3031.28 3044.28 speaker3  Okay, so he's going to try to just take her out. Land on her?
3042.28 3060.28 speaker1  Oh, my God. It's a straight 69. Oh, my God.
3059.28 3067.28 speaker3  That's right.
3064.28 3076.28 speaker2  Yeah, it's got all of its tendrils except for two plugged in because those two had been lasered off previously.
3074.28 3151.28 speaker3  and bringing Tilda into this world getting bigger and darker. And just as she thinks she's about to pull it through, she's at her moment of utmost concentration. Everything ends for Mary. Everything goes black. There's no more consciousness, no more pain, no more struggle. The mission is over. Mary is over. The rest of the people in this weird world feel everything around them reverberate as Planet Juggernaut crashes into the ground, and it kind of pillows into the soft surface of this space. And you don't hear the sound that you think you should as it's kind of absorbed into the floor of this world a little bit like you jumped on a soft pillow
3145.28 3393.28 speaker2  one Ball named John, and an AT-ST holding the Dawn exist out of combat. And as Zack, the bald, mustachioed man sitting across from you, continues to describe this group of people on this alternate plane, figuring out what they're going to do next. You notice the walls of this room swiftly change color and placement. Suddenly, one wall is covered in a moving blanket that's been nailed up to keep the daylight out of this baseball-themed room. The adjacent walls have been painted Cardinals Red with the St. Louis skyline and Busch Stadium, and five friends sit around a desk and a table, each with a microphone in front of their mouths. Next to this enthusiastically narrating Zack sits a chortling Justin with thick, curly hair, clear frames on his glasses, and a consistent giggle that reflects his compassion and tenderheartedness. is nimbly slipped in by this sharp, well-bearded Thomas, who finger guns a Luke who is wearing a cute top and sick new shoes and a hat that is both abstract and completely made out of leather. And this comedically verdant Luke looks up into the sky and says, Hell yeah. He says that at the exact moment a charming, punctual Joe Terry with long, windswept-in-a-nice-way hair brings the group back to the story with a sentence that is somehow both equally in and out of the story, which leads this thankful Zack, distressingly unaware of me or you or any of us, back into this group's current contention story, in which the filter on the colorization changes as we all see the city. Everything is drab and gray with a sickly green tint to it. The streets are covered in trash and spilled liquids. There's a scent in the air like someone left out cheese and a colostomy bag on every corner. The faces of the buildings are slathered in billboards and the faces of the people bumbling about would be bloated and lifeless if there were any people here, but there are not. In a strange opposition to this depressive scenery there are beautiful flowers in every shade and shape growing in every otherwise empty alleyway and out of many cracks in the sidewalks and roads. You all get the sense that this is some sort of nighttime, though the stars are bright enough to light the sky. Perhaps the people who live here are merely asleep or elsewhere. And suddenly countless different versions of a group of contention police officers fighting off some wild threat begin to appear from portals placed pervasively throughout this city. So I like to imagine the first group is clearly Clark Bishop, John Lee Pettymore IV, Keith Vigna, and some sort of animal friend all in astronaut suits, extravehicular mobility units for you trivia people. But along with these four there's a mind-shatteringly immense creature squeezing its way into this existence. This belief-wrecking monstrosity smells like rain and smoke and the dried sweat of a loved one. And it reminds you of a time you felt safe. The next group through one of these many portals is three myriad agents wearing pinstripe suits and trilby hats blowing on whistles that sound like they say FBI when blown. And they're chasing these four versions, these like mobster versions of John, Keith, Clark, and whatever Justin is playing in this. What would you look like?
3388.28 3410.28 speaker1  And the white shirt doesn't fit quite right so the top few buttons are unbuttoned. And maybe one of the suspender straps is a little bit dangly. It's not quite fit right. And he's disheveled.
3407.28 3471.28 speaker3  And he's got a Tommy gun. And he kind of shoves the disheveled Clark on by. Keith has a white cotton tank top on with some black dress pants that are quite big. Like those crazy 40s ties. Like the memes of the biblical angels.
3470.28 3507.28 speaker2  Yeah. where all these portals are opening up in the empty city and all of these different versions from different versions of...
3506.28 3531.28 speaker3  That's exactly right. Into a shared game space. Yeah. Which is the city. Yes!
3527.28 3590.28 speaker2  One's purple and one's green and they're both staying on his head for some reason. And he's got pirate vibes. He's got a pirate shirt on underneath a long tuxedo where the tail on the coat is actually 14 yards long. You get a Wonka character? A Wonka character?
3589.28 3643.28 speaker1  Yeah. Some kind. Is that a Wonka? That's the Wonka. Is that a Wonka? Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's perfect. He got swept away after his child got taken. And he's just following these people who seem like they know how to get out of here.
3642.28 3681.28 speaker2  Oh, wow. Yeah, I know. I know. It's wild. My final one is that busting through one of these portals into this weird city scene is Keith Beans in an Olympic style wrestling leotard. Clark Bishop wearing a crown made of flowers with a guitar strapped to his back. And you both look like you have what are oversized paper clips aimed directly at a John ball. And at the end of each of these metal tendrils, what do you have?
3677.28 3712.28 speaker3  Just a bunch of myriads with Tommy guns.
3705.28 3724.28 speaker2  We're back in this room talking to each other and dealing with...
3722.28 3751.28 speaker3  Roll sanity.
3734.28 3770.28 speaker2  When a sound like a swelling sea surf surrounds you and smothers your senses as an actual swelling sea surf consisting of cramped small-scale xenonematodes begins collapsing down toward you.
3768.28 3772.28 speaker1  We could have been doing so much. Shut up, Zach. Come on. What kind of world are you living in?
