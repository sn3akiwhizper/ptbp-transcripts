24.52 93.04 speaker0  who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod, A thing you should do, lest your blessed internet guests guess that your zest for ingesting my jests has been wrested from your chest. But I digress. Sam Witch writes, you've given to the letterer every week, telling those that would be to my left and to my right to keep the radio dial tuned to 694.2 PTBP, despite there being none other than me in this near featureless void. You, Wolf the Dog, are the only exception to the otherwise unending monotony. Thus to you I plead, please, Wolf the Dog, be my lifeline back to the extensive library that led me here with its yellowed pages and please be quiet signs. No, that's okay, Sam Witch.

137.68 244.36 speaker1  to the crisis cold weather shelter in their hometown of Springfield, Missouri. because of the good y'all helped us spread and no matter what kind of water fills your holes, that stole footage from Vivica at the Cannes station. The two officers showed up in CPD cruiser number 836 and Chief Mac used cop net to identify them as officer Richard Riley and officer Wilson Wiley. Julius Summers and asked him to come back to the Cannes station soon to meet in Tithe's office and to bring Beck and Cal. After a quick stop at Riley and Wiley's local drinking hole, which is of course called W-A-R-E-R-We, we're at Bucky's Kids Bar, duh, the Cannes crew was able to bribe the night manager for Riley and Wiley's addresses. more impatient this time, requesting the team's presence in his office.
242.24 279.50 speaker0  my widdle baby. And it's all my fault Cause my life is great And it's all mine
276.50 301.62 speaker1  And it's all my fault And it's all my fault Hey Luke, who was your favorite teacher?
298.74 318.94 speaker2  My first pet named after my favorite teacher. Jesus, Jesus, okay. Uh, oh crap, I was trying to think of like a-
317.50 323.22 speaker1  That's the hill he died on.
320.94 348.66 speaker2  And he stayed dead. Dude, I was laughing the other day. I was online, somebody was like, so he didn't die for our sins, he like took a weekend off for our sins.
346.78 369.06 speaker3  He died, he went to hell. I don't ask me why he went to hell. He stole the gates. No, not the gates, that would be too much. It would be too much for him to carry. Far too much.
367.66 371.66 speaker2  It does sound like a set up for a joke.
369.06 381.70 speaker3  Okay, so Jesus dies, he goes to hell. He steals the keys, not the gates. Yeah, from hell.
378.62 385.58 speaker2  Yeah, Alan Moore's adaptation. I want that-
383.46 403.22 speaker3  Wait, so did Jesus really go to hell? There are many eye witnesses to- who do believe that Jesus went to hell and stole the keys.
402.38 404.54 speaker2  and that's what they believe.
403.22 417.02 speaker3  So you worship a thief? Wow. like a thief in the night for his followers.
414.58 422.70 speaker2  if Jesus comes back, we'll kill him again.
421.22 427.70 speaker3  Is this an ad for Roman? Did I show you guys the shirt that I bought
426.32 456.58 speaker2  Yes, you did. I cannot wait to get that one. kind of like kicking back. And it says, if you don't like my attitude, call 1-800-EAT-SHIT. I was hoping that I could. Now I'll just have to wear it to a client meeting. No, just have to wear it, yeah.
455.54 474.38 speaker3  No, it's not Christmas time. It's January, mid January. How's sober January going for you guys?
470.02 484.98 speaker2  is gonna be until, you know, usually January 3rd, so. Mine's jerk off every day. In 2022. It's the same one every year.
483.22 495.34 speaker3  so we're rocking 359. How many times have you KO'd? Wait, say the first part again.
492.74 517.50 speaker2  I would say maybe not every day, but at least enough to average one a day.
516.54 534.54 speaker3  Average. Yeah, at least. in a day.
532.66 542.10 speaker2  I'm proud of each and every one of them.
541.26 552.66 speaker3  Yeah. One of my favorite Christmas movies.
551.54 567.42 speaker2  Oh my goodness. Die hard. Have you guys watched the Lindsay Lohan Christmas movie? I did, yes. Was it bad? Top notch. Like recommend or like it's fine that you watched it?
565.02 569.52 speaker3  Yeah, I had to notch it all the way up.
568.68 572.34 speaker2  Real tight. Did you really watch it?
571.50 623.04 speaker3  Yeah, I did watch it. It was on at my house. I didn't put it on. Probably your dumb wife. My dumb, I couldn't even say it. Taylor, my extremely intelligent and compassionate wife. another one of our guests here at Pretending to be People. Another one of my wives. They put it on when we were hanging out and then I think they hung out and I watched the Lindsay Lohan Christmas film. It very much is a Hallmark movie. It's just on Netflix, yeah. She bonks her head, forgets who she is. The guy that she falls in love with is technically taking advantage of her because she knows how much money she's worth.
621.20 645.76 speaker2  do you mean he still actually really loves her? Oh, defo. I saw one on Peacock called Love on Rye and this Jewish matchmaker sets these two people up and then the drama is that they find out that they operate competing delis.
644.92 649.54 speaker3  TBD.
647.50 658.94 speaker2  I think he's asking is it reality or? That's historical fiction is what Luke means. Based on a true story probably. Yeah, Argo style.
656.94 662.98 speaker3  Sounds like it's based on You've Got Mail.
661.14 663.98 speaker2  It's called Hanukkah on Rye.
662.98 667.62 speaker3  What did you say it was? Love on Rye?
664.86 671.72 speaker2  Yeah, I was wondering if that was like a play on words for something. Well.
670.90 672.56 speaker3  Let's do it.
671.72 675.50 speaker2  Dive on in.
674.66 691.54 speaker3  Dive. Let's do a dive into the pool. Hey, remember what we said earlier about Scottish accents. Oh, I said I was gonna do a dive into the pool.
689.74 695.26 speaker2  As long as you're respectful.
693.98 715.66 speaker3  What's four feet? Bet I can dive in here.
713.22 720.50 speaker2  Richard or Wylie? Or say their names.
719.46 726.38 speaker3  Wilson Wylie.
721.66 731.20 speaker2  Wilson or Richard and we've got a date with Uncle Tife. You do have a date with Uncle Tife.
727.70 751.86 speaker3  You've been out and about today going from place to place. I believe you started over at Vivica's apartment, headed on back to the can station, which then led you out to a bar. What was the bar called?
749.22 753.10 speaker2  An eloquent, well-spoken gentleman.
751.86 766.46 speaker3  An articulate gentleman. And he gave you the names of the... He gave the names.
764.84 785.98 speaker2  Cops on the Godel payroll. Which led us to, where are we? Duh. Where we spoke to Bucky Kid's kid. That's right. Who pointed us to Lulu, the night manager. L-E-A-U-X.
785.14 788.70 speaker3  Lolo. L-E-A-X. Is it Lolo?
787.64 843.52 speaker2  It's Lolo. Pardon me. He pointed us towards Lolo, the night manager of where are we, we're at Bucky Kid's bar, duh. And I think it grew on us a little bit. I'm fine with it, as long as you're the one who remembers how to say it. It's like Wawa KBD, right? Or B-K-B. Wawa book-ba. Wawa book-ba-da is what they call it for short. He hooked us up with a couple addresses. After Cal. Called him. And. Tricked him. And.
842.68 847.98 speaker3  Fin modem? Fin modem.
844.52 867.12 speaker2  Yes, sometimes you must grease the palms of truth. And then I think we took off towards one of the addresses. so you can give us the character you want us to meet first. And on the way there, Tife texted Julius, said, hey, get here soon, but we got a date for 45 minutes. Yeah, and what are we supposed to meet Tife about?
865.84 882.72 speaker3  I don't think we know, I think he just. You didn't talk to Tife. He hasn't seen you around. It's been a minute since you've seen Tife, so he's probably just curious.
881.60 889.84 speaker1  that we didn't have the footage and we were trying to get the footage back?
888.40 901.72 speaker2  so it's. I told him I was working out, that's why I couldn't meet with him then. It's like, I gotta see my cousin's hot gym bod. I don't know if we did, did we tell him about the footage? I don't know if we did.
900.36 908.68 speaker3  I feel like we did, I feel like we told him
907.04 915.24 speaker2  I told him I was working out.
911.76 919.84 speaker3  Okay, I thought we did, but it doesn't matter either way. He'll ask us where it is if we get there.
916.56 925.60 speaker2  In that moment, two possible realities were created.
922.24 930.48 speaker3  So we'll be playing two different stories from here on out coming out on still the biweekly schedule.
928.52 935.36 speaker2  It might get a little wild. And who knows, maybe we'll go back and forward in time. Oh, god.
934.28 958.20 speaker3  Oh, timey-wimey? Oh, timey-wimey. you're not going to be able to visit there and make it back to the can station in time for the meeting with Tyfe. So you have a choice at this point. You can either show up early for the meeting or you can go to one of these homes and then show up late to the meeting.
956.48 970.40 speaker2  in getting to these places right now? To get our footage back. Yeah, have the footage when we go to work. I think we were pretty heavily headed in the direction
969.56 976.60 speaker3  Yeah, I think so too.
974.52 977.48 speaker1  when we get to one of these places.
976.60 1000.16 speaker2  Looking at these names, I wonder if he had a voice plan for Richard Riley and then he's just gonna do it again with like a lisp for Wilson Wiley. It seems like his style. but I think I can hold him off if we're a little late.
998.64 1003.52 speaker3  Let's go to Wilson Wiley's. Brrrrrr.
1001.68 1010.82 speaker2  Arghhh.
1009.74 1021.40 speaker1  Ahhh-ooh-ha.
1016.40 1052.60 speaker3  The apartment for Wilson Wiley is in a nice tall... Yeah, do you like that? What's this neighborhood called? Oh, the downtown area. It's a hot July day, midday, rolling into downtown, skyscrapers towering on either side of you. You continue in Cal Colorado's beautiful Mercedes C-Class with a, what was it?
1048.82 1065.12 speaker2  and Julius is in the back watching Cloud Atlas. Hahahaha. talking loudly over the radio and saying, do you like this Beck?
1064.08 1071.48 speaker1  Yeah, man, it's...
1069.44 1118.04 speaker3  and that's, I mean, it's got its things too. No, that's a good one, yeah. All right, yeah. Did we start at one? Yeah, yeah. Wait, hook? Hook. Hahahaha.
1114.96 1139.24 speaker2  and it's kind of like looking very inspired. What is an ocean but a multitude of drops? And then they pull up to Wylie's house. but that's what they're calling it.
1134.24 1155.52 speaker3  So you guys pull into a underground parking lot for an apartment building in the downtown area? Da. Da da. And it's like really nice.
1154.68 1161.24 speaker2  Indeed.
1157.48 1169.56 speaker3  and an elevator that leads you up into the building. His apartment's on the eighth floor.
1167.20 1185.90 speaker2  Making our way to the downtown area. Driving fast. Looking for Wilson Wylie. On the DVD. Funky Nassau.
1184.40 1187.80 speaker3  And Oprah.
1186.74 1199.76 speaker2  She's thinking of the color purple. Dammit.
1198.92 1258.76 speaker3  Nailed it. That's closer. No, but like a... So you guys get out of the C class There's a doorman who's actually stationed down in the parking area and he greets you and he's just like... Eighth floor? And he clicks the up button on the elevator. Who are you going to visit? Oh, just an old friend. Dave. City Action News. Whoa, that's right. I knew you looked familiar. How are you doing today, Dave? Wow, better now, sir. Got any news for me?
1256.36 1264.72 speaker2  But that's not what we're doing here today. Again, this is just an old family friend we're checking up on.
1262.32 1265.70 speaker3  Well, of course, you all have a lovely day.
1264.72 1271.32 speaker2  You too, Dave. I stay waving until I'm sure the elevator doors have closed and he's gone down.
1269.64 1281.68 speaker3  The elevator doors have closed. You are going up. He has stayed in the same spot. No, he was on the outside of the elevator. He's in the...
1280.20 1288.56 speaker2  I thought he was in it with us also.
1287.72 1293.52 speaker3  Yeah, I thought we... I'm not so much an elevator attendant as a parking garage kind of guy.
1291.92 1306.98 speaker2  There's a way to make this work in the edit without us saying anything else. Hahaha. As the doors open to the eighth floor,
1303.08 1315.44 speaker3  It's got scenes of the jungle on it. So there's lots of different plant life
1313.76 1322.44 speaker2  like at the Springfield airport.
1319.44 1330.96 speaker3  I just watched season one of White Lotus last year. It was really good. Was there animals? I don't remember. of everything Zach just described.
1330.12 1332.92 speaker2  Okay, so it's that.
1330.96 1342.68 speaker3  It's the White Lotus season one intro. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I was just thinking about it. Hahaha. And there's...

1476.42 1489.86 speaker3  and you see just the most adorable little six year old on the other side staring up at you.
1487.22 1500.06 speaker2  and then turns back to her with a huge smile
1498.22 1538.86 speaker3  in front of me at the door. Come in and look at my toys. Sandal, I like Sandal very much. Me too. Tressa, does Tressa know Oh, it seems that Tressa is hungry.

1564.38 1569.34 speaker1  against the horse's mouth.

1574.18 1599.38 speaker3  Who's leaving a six year old home alone? That's good. These neglectful parents. You think that you hear a sound coming from like the bathroom or something, but. Then a cat hops out.

1675.58 1684.98 speaker2  It does not work.
1683.18 1688.98 speaker3  If you create, I'll give it to you.
1687.82 1696.22 speaker1  It was a 23.
1694.10 1725.50 speaker2  Does Julius start seeing numbers? Yeah. Like it just kind of feels like. God told them to. But it was boobs was the apartment number, right? I did already, it didn't work.
1722.50 1738.30 speaker3  but there is currently not a laptop and it seems like the charger is pulled up in that spot and there's like a clip for it and the mouse and mouse pad are there, but there's no laptop sitting in the empty spot on the desk.
1737.46 1741.30 speaker2  What? You know what?
1740.46 1742.12 speaker3  Yeah.

1752.54 1762.26 speaker2  She smiles. Do you get left alone here very often? No. No? How long ago did your parents step out?
1760.46 1785.54 speaker3  She's just like playing with toys and there's like some things have been pulled out of the fridge and like no chopping has started, but it seems like meal prep is about to begin.
1783.18 1793.74 speaker2  who feeds you good nutritious food. I'm sure your dad cares about that too. What time would you say he left for work?
1792.90 1805.60 speaker3  Oh. Of what year?
1804.78 1808.82 speaker2  What? How old are you? The year you were born.
1807.98 1815.06 speaker3  I'm this many. Six, Julius.
1813.94 1822.22 speaker2  It's 2022. He tries, yeah, I'm not doing that math.
1818.22 1828.18 speaker3  It's like 1980, what am I, Stephen Hawking?
1823.18 1835.90 speaker2  Julius tries eight, three, you said six years old? Well, not, yeah, but.
1834.46 1842.70 speaker3  and she's six years old. Yeah, eight.
1841.86 1860.32 speaker2  16. Eight, three, 16. Roll luck again. 90 is good, right? I liked them. Oh, that's my friend Julius. He's very clumsy. Are any of these animals clumsy?
1859.50 1869.06 speaker3  Twain? Twain. Twain is very clumsy. Yeah, Twain is always twipping.
1866.42 1874.44 speaker2  It's okay to be clumsy sometimes. Yeah.
1871.38 1877.90 speaker1  Do you think that means that the name is Twain or Train?
1875.82 1886.02 speaker2  Julius tries nine, one, one.
1884.14 1923.54 speaker3  and just like trying repeatedly to open it with different random numbers, you're not having a lot of luck. But while this conversation is happening with the child in the main room and you're going through all this stuff by the desk in this back room, you see that underneath some folders and there's some mail and there's a handwritten piece of paper shoved up in the middle of it.
1921.86 1926.54 speaker2  It says it's always kept unlocked.
1924.42 1937.00 speaker3  It's meant to be hard to get into. You can't just pass a search check and get into a safe. The paper. It says. That's safes.
1936.16 1961.06 speaker2  As a role-playing mechanic. As a reminder, safes. Oh yeah. Locking. It should be difficult. It should feel challenging but rewarding.
1958.46 1983.46 speaker3  The Naturhole, which you all know is an abandoned baseball stadium in the city. It was abandoned because there was a sinkhole. In the middle of the infield that basically eliminated the entire playing area within the stadium. However, the stadium seating itself.
1981.90 1985.58 speaker2  Well, plus the triple A team,
1984.74 2013.02 speaker3  That's right. Wait, no, they can't play there. They were. Exactly. And it's a movie theater that we called. The Naturhole. The Naturhole. Shout out to Thomas Cox, not a patron. Just on our, in our session. Just a friend of the podcast. In our session zero that is yet to be released. Our session zero part two for season two.
2011.82 2019.12 speaker2  Unofficial collaborator.
2017.98 2022.54 speaker3  The Naturhole. The Naturhole. The Naturhole.
2020.86 2026.42 speaker2  Currently the movie theater.
2025.58 2043.10 speaker3  The Naturhole. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like an omni-plex or whatever where you like look down into this massive screen and you like, yeah.
2041.70 2053.34 speaker2  They're still figuring it out. I bet that's cool for five minutes.
2051.10 2066.62 speaker3  it has cross streets, which are on like the Northeast side of the Naturhole. And it says, follow down.
2063.14 2076.64 speaker2  He grabs it and goes out into the main area with them. Guys, I think I've found a clue. And he looks over at the like meal prep area.
2075.22 2083.80 speaker1  Beck agrees, Beck. As soon as he heard her say that she was just popping out for groceries, he felt like we're on a time crunch.
2082.58 2097.80 speaker2  Oh yeah, yeah. If you feel like we were good here, and he's like sitting crisscross applesauce and having his nails painted. And he's like, oh, yeah, yeah.
2095.14 2107.92 speaker3  You mean Cal, your own character? I don't fucking know.
2106.60 2116.36 speaker2  I can do them later. Let's.
2115.48 2117.44 speaker4  Are you leaving?
2116.36 2145.96 speaker2  I'm so sorry. It was so nice to meet you and all your friends. But anytime, if you feel like you miss us, you can just tune in to the local news and you'll see me again. This is Cal, Colorado saying it was nice to meet you.
2143.92 2182.84 speaker3  give me a strength. You can't pick up a fucking safe. Five on a 50. But as you lift it up off the ground, you see that there's no bottom on it. Like you're just lifting the top up off. It's like not connected to its base. do you have the cash on you or have you already?
2180.74 2188.60 speaker2  Yep, Julius has it in his hands and is like,
2187.48 2194.40 speaker4  Monopoly money.
2192.28 2195.62 speaker2  far too cruel for one of your age.
2194.40 2205.92 speaker3  That's what my mom says. Where did you get that?
2204.52 2210.08 speaker2  He just kept points in the room,
2208.60 2219.64 speaker3  like I don't know what he fucking said.
2218.52 2224.44 speaker2  and sees all the money. Beck follows.
2222.84 2230.82 speaker3  But is that all there is? Oh no, there's a bunch of papers and stuff too.
2229.98 2237.00 speaker2  He does. Does Cal want to be in it or?
2235.64 2239.36 speaker3  and says, do a boomerang.
2238.00 2264.34 speaker2  Julius. And he starts dabbing. Julius puts down the phone and is like, maybe we shouldn't document this. No, no, no. Okay, well, get pictures. Beck, you're filming, right? Oh yes. We need to document that this man has been paid off by the goddess. Is the paperwork or anything in there give any indication where the money came from?
2263.24 2266.56 speaker1  Oh yeah, that's great.
2264.34 2278.80 speaker3  That's what you need to do. Roll accounting, everyone who's checking this out. Wow, I have accounting. No, I'm going to go with accounting.
2275.60 2280.84 speaker2  I got a crit success, a 33 on a 50.
2278.80 2284.40 speaker3  Okay, that's awesome.
2282.68 2287.44 speaker2  These figures are all a little bit over my head. Does anybody know what these mean? Oh, Julius.
2286.60 2292.98 speaker1  Let me take a look.
2288.88 2320.40 speaker3  Wilson Wiley seems to be on the payroll for some sort of a nonprofit. through all of these stacks of papers and papers with your keen accounting skills and that critical success, you flip through and you can draw a direct line from the Godel company to a shell, to a shell, to a shell, to a shell, to this nonprofit.
2318.72 2347.20 speaker2  I don't know, not here. W-A-R. There's something big here. How do you know? It's all in here. And Julius holds up all the paperwork and documents, pockets it, leaves the money. He's like, we should go.
2345.22 2363.06 speaker1  I don't know if we need to take anything with us because I've got it all on camera.
2361.12 2374.02 speaker2  I fail, a 62 on a 40. Sorry, I keep meaning to get up and get my own. Of the elevator.
2372.88 2375.52 speaker4  What ding?
2374.02 2388.78 speaker1  The egg timer on the counter. I think we really need to get out of here and quick.
2387.86 2396.74 speaker2  Let's hoof it, boys. Julius is gonna keep, he's gonna keep the papers, leave everything else and hoof it.
2395.56 2416.22 speaker3  I would love to have the tea party If you give her the hug, you're gonna get caught in the room.
2414.18 2436.34 speaker2  I'm running backwards out the front door. Julius says, don't tell anyone we were here. Nobody will believe you. The three of you like.
2433.14 2458.06 speaker3  like the hall wall on the other side away from this door as the door slams shut and you turn and looking down the hall, you see a woman in her mid thirties carrying like four bags of groceries, tote bags walking toward you with suspicious eyes and I need whoever has the highest bureaucracy.
2457.22 2479.70 speaker2  I got a 70. I got a 50. Oh, one floor up. He always does this.
2478.18 2490.70 speaker4  He's quite stupid, ma'am.
2488.50 2497.30 speaker2  and frantically pressing the elevator button.
2495.34 2503.74 speaker3  No, it's right there because she just came up on it and you hop into the elevator. You going up to the ninth?
2501.42 2509.26 speaker2  Yeah, I press one and as the door is closed, I make a show of like being like,
2506.94 2511.78 speaker3  We'll have to do it all over again.
2510.60 2524.22 speaker4  She's like already in her apartment. Yeah, she's gone.
2521.78 2527.84 speaker2  We just sat outside their apartment knocking for roughly 15 minutes.
2527.02 2532.58 speaker3  Who was it again? Oh, we call them Gramps.
2531.46 2538.10 speaker4  We call them Gramps. Oh, oh, Gramps.
2537.26 2544.50 speaker2  We've got places to be.
2542.80 2550.28 speaker3  Yeah, 58 on an 80.
2549.44 2562.46 speaker4  You both rolled higher.
2560.96 2583.84 speaker3  whatever he's thinking about before. Just how many times he can jerk off in a day. Without thinking it's weird.
2581.44 2599.96 speaker1  to walk past her or was that a mistake?
2599.12 2610.12 speaker4  I don't know. Go pee, okay.
2607.26 2622.92 speaker3  And we're back and you guys have just headed down into the parking garage here, hopping in that Mercedes C-Class and heading out, saying goodbye to the nice gentleman who's waiting at the elevator, thinking about J and O.
2621.04 2629.74 speaker2  How we looking on time?
2628.78 2635.74 speaker3  What's it say? And it just says ETA question mark
2632.28 2656.62 speaker2  because it is time for you to be at the can station. but we're bringing him the story of a lifetime and then we head to Richard Riley's house.
2655.40 2663.68 speaker1  and just do it from here. Maybe we can find that idea.
2660.68 2674.74 speaker2  After I send traffic, I say FaceTime question mark. Bring, bring, bring, bring.
2671.24 2682.74 speaker4  Hey, what's up my fucking nephew? How you living?
2680.36 2694.64 speaker3  but you are not here. And you said you were gonna be here. Not base bro, not base bro. Forget about it.
2692.72 2710.28 speaker2  Cloud Atlas in Cal's car because the traffic is just crazy.
2708.32 2717.34 speaker3  Where is Cal? Where's Beck?
2714.28 2793.80 speaker2  trying not to like let him see that the traffic may not be as bad as we said, but I show like Cal and Beck. I'm like, they're in the car here with me. Beck gives a wave as the camera pans. Yeah, Cal gives a little salute and says, great to see you, Typh. Hey, we're working on the story of a lifetime here. I think you're gonna like what your nephew serves up to you. Obviously, traffic's a little behind I'm sitting here driving and also he's Googling different sources and calling them and things. Lots of wrecks, lots of construction. Oh, wow, I think I just saw another one. Another one. We could stop and get some food for you. No, no, absolutely. We'll go ahead and do that. Do not stop.
2791.76 2809.80 speaker3  Oh, wow, horrible reception.
2808.24 2814.08 speaker2  and like making that sound and then.
2813.24 2823.28 speaker4  Like.
2821.24 2826.44 speaker2  We'll be in by the end of the day.
2824.48 2845.88 speaker3  I mean, I need you here right away, straight here right now, okay? Otherwise it's back to Barstow for you, Julius. Cause I ain't going back to Barstow, that's all you. I thought you said Barstool. Ah, no, I didn't.
2843.80 2850.68 speaker4  when you go work for me, bro?
2848.56 2874.76 speaker2  I've heard him say many times at the Foundry that his dream job is to work for Barstool. He hangs up. He says like bye, but that he kind of hangs up. Julius would love to work for Barstool Sports.
2873.04 2887.32 speaker3  Welcome back to Call Me Daddy.
2886.14 2889.84 speaker2  Dave something? Portnoy. I was going to say it's Portnoy.
2889.00 2894.60 speaker4  Port something. Portnoy, yeah. Dave Cooley.
2893.48 2903.56 speaker3  Oh, Will Ferrell.
2901.30 2920.86 speaker2  before we get to Richard's house. I mean, couldn't you be doing something more productive like editing a TikTok? We are at work. I mean, I don't think Julius has any TikToks to edit. A good one.
2919.98 2932.20 speaker1  Another little tease.
2929.10 2938.42 speaker3  that you've uploaded with Grover's Gorge footage have been deleted.
2936.42 2944.98 speaker2  and changes the password for the TikTok.
2940.98 2963.98 speaker3  because it might send an email that you have to change the password to, but it might two-factor you. Let's just get a luck roll since we're playing a dice game. I want under 50.
2962.26 2972.42 speaker4  Oh, boy.
2971.14 2986.42 speaker3  You're not sure what happened, but when you go to TikTok on your browser, that most recent TikTok, also not there,
2985.58 3001.50 speaker2  Oh, shit! they're not going to, this story's done.
3000.50 3010.66 speaker4  I'm working on it.
3008.30 3025.26 speaker2  did you meant deleted by the user
3022.78 3044.30 speaker3  No, there wasn't a notification that it had been flagged. Good question, because some content on there
3043.34 3054.54 speaker2  Vroom, vroom, vroom.
3051.90 3066.68 speaker3  or are we at the can station?
3065.86 3081.38 speaker1  Yeah.
3080.54 3090.94 speaker2  Wait, Rachel.
3088.58 3106.14 speaker3  That is where Richard Reilly lives. He is an officer of the city police department and you are pulling up to a guard house outside of a gate.
3104.26 3109.34 speaker2  Wouldn't they have the same last name?
3107.70 3121.06 speaker1  I didn't catch Dave's last name.
3116.06 3131.30 speaker3  The slightly better off brother of the two. He gets to sit down. A little more hair. Yeah, out.
3130.46 3148.58 speaker1  Right.
3147.14 3154.66 speaker2  and it still looks this good. Fuck you.
3153.56 3161.74 speaker4  Whoa, Dave.
3158.96 3173.82 speaker3  And he taps slowly on his name badge. Darren. Hello, Darren.
3172.86 3224.62 speaker2  Heroes. But first we need to see an old family friend who lives in the inside. Could you let us in real quick so we can check on them? They had a small gift they wanted to give. Oh, we just call them Gramps.
3223.46 3235.06 speaker3  26 pass. 60 pass. Fuck you. Nice.
3233.02 3242.78 speaker2  And he said he had something he really wanted to give us. But afterwards, we'll come interview you.
3240.90 3265.28 speaker3  as he clicks the button and says, tell Gramps hello and have a good day. See you soon.
3263.52 3280.60 speaker2  And we're looking for the house that has like the metal archway that says Riley on it. Gross.
3276.00 3287.44 speaker3  And it's got like a shield on one side and a eagle on the other. Like, you know, laser cut into the metal.
3286.16 3296.24 speaker2  It says Lorem Ipsum.
3295.04 3310.82 speaker1  Latin shit put up there.
3307.88 3362.70 speaker3  would you like there to be a car in the driveway? You said car. Damn it. He still made a family. Cal brings like the C class. Actually, no, there's a shitty station wagon in the driveway. He hates his family.
3360.94 3369.14 speaker2  and he's like peering over the steering wheel and kind of glaring at the scene.
3366.02 3380.48 speaker1  I mean, I think as bad as much as I've ever thought this whole time. We got to get the footage, but I don't know how. I mean, do we just talk to him?
3377.22 3433.16 speaker2  his reaction is kind of some sort of, you know, evidence, First of all, I think we're going to be dealing with another mom. Yeah. Julius son, no offense, but you should leave the mom to me. Julius is instilled with the confidence of the group and rings the doorbell. is your husband home. Jesus Christ.
3432.32 3454.14 speaker4  Roll that. That's the stuff. That's the stuff.
3452.18 3471.96 speaker3  She goes, he never is. Cal like turns to you guys and has like a shocked look on his face. and yelling over her shoulder essentially.
3470.56 3477.80 speaker2  Not much better it would seem.
3476.40 3493.52 speaker3  someone to love them. Yes, don't we all? Would you? She's pouring a drink.
3491.04 3508.64 speaker2  our new executive producer. He's kind of a rising star here at Cannes. but you know, I've got a lot to learn from the man.
3505.88 3532.52 speaker3  As she eyes you down and down.
3527.52 3556.84 speaker2  and you can hear like a little seam rip. Ooh, I got a little pumpin' at the lake earlier. Well, as she hands you each your drink. Thank you very much. What was your name, ma'am? Debs.
3556.00 3576.12 speaker3  Of Richard? That seems like all I am. to show me off black tie events with a bunch of the worst people in the fuckin' world. Oh, what do you mean by that? Charities, nonprofits, you know the type. Ah, yes.
3575.20 3593.92 speaker2  Such ghouls. at all these charity functions with the who's who of the city? He's rubbing elbows.
3592.68 3595.68 speaker3  He's making friends.
3594.84 3619.88 speaker2  you usually have to show up Comedy Hour. Youth sports is solid. Damn it. Debate League.
3617.52 3625.32 speaker4  That's really good.
3622.68 3636.76 speaker2  for Children's Leukemia for the last 15 years. Oh, I don't make anything, ma'am. goes into it each year, but we've raised over $20 million in that time. Wow.
3635.92 3644.88 speaker4  Wow, wow.
3643.84 3662.88 speaker2  Yeah, we know about the thighs. How are Julius's eyes? Julius says, my thighs are down here. from your husband. He said he'd be here, but we can just, we're kind of in a hurry. We can just grab it.
3661.08 3667.48 speaker1  we'll be right, right as rain.
3663.84 3681.92 speaker3  I'm in my cups and he crit succeeded, so. Oh, when was that? Oh, I mean, as soon as I heard you on the other side of the door. Oh, you mean me?
3679.72 3685.96 speaker2  and you're like, you had rolled out their interaction as a couple earlier this morning. He crit succeeded.
3684.52 3700.72 speaker4  I'm like, what's that? And he's like, don't fucking worry about it. Don't fucking worry about it.
3697.64 3711.40 speaker2  Yes, your husband was reviewing some footage for us in a capacity as a expert consultant. We needed to see a law man's opinion of things.
3707.20 3716.32 speaker3  No, he said he was taking the footage to the nature hole.
3713.40 3719.68 speaker2  Cal slams his drink and he says, thank you very much, man.
3718.84 3730.68 speaker4  Dude. Thanks, man. Thanks, bro.
3729.56 3739.12 speaker2  It's been a pleasure to meet you. I just remembered we're late for our interview with Darren, your gatekeeper, but. Oh, I love Darren.
3737.72 3747.68 speaker3  Yeah, you can send him in. Cal is like scribbling down a number and he's like,
3744.36 3756.52 speaker2  to the story, you can reach Julius here at any time. She takes it.
3755.48 3769.56 speaker3  Lorem Ipsum.
3767.88 3772.72 speaker2  We've got to get to the nature hole.
3771.64 3781.32 speaker1  That's what she said, right? Do you think it's our footage?
3779.84 3785.48 speaker2  that we found, too. What? The connection.
3783.92 3810.76 speaker4  Oh yeah, you here, look. SG, nature hole.
3807.76 3815.92 speaker1  so I don't have to wiggle in my ears.
3811.76 3825.60 speaker2  It's really tiring when it goes on for like six minutes. drill bits on Alibaba come up.
3824.76 3833.28 speaker3  That's one of my favorite bands. Did you do that? Drill bits on Alibaba.
3832.44 3838.68 speaker2  Yeah. For real?
3836.84 3840.68 speaker3  Cool, neither one of them reacted.
3839.52 3846.16 speaker2  They're good at pretending. To what?
3845.32 3847.00 speaker3  Duh.
3846.16 3847.84 speaker2  Yeah.
3847.00 3854.36 speaker3  It's from- Type. Yeah. What's it say? Love ya.
3853.52 3859.68 speaker2  What does it say?
3856.96 3861.40 speaker3  I need you to come and bring Beck and Cal.
3859.68 3867.88 speaker2  I text Beck, yeah, for sure. Like I said, end of day. By the end of the day.
3865.80 3888.20 speaker3  this is good news, come right now.
3887.36 3893.88 speaker2  Yeah.
3890.72 3902.96 speaker4  Caw, caw, caw, bird, bird, bird noise, bird noise.
3899.92 3904.76 speaker2  One that eats like bugs off a rhino.
3903.80 3916.68 speaker1  Oh, should we came in too early and now we found out that he turned into a bird. Big bird.
3915.84 3923.20 speaker2  Dang.
3921.16 3940.24 speaker3  Cal, you are behind the wheel. You know that the natur hole is off in a different direction than the can station. It's gonna make you even later to this meeting than you already are if you head that way.
3937.36 3947.84 speaker2  we have to have jobs in order to break news and type's not happy. I think we ought to stop by the station before we go out there.
3945.48 3961.32 speaker1  I mean, we could even, if you feel like we have to, we can maybe talk around the issue while we're there. Yeah, maybe I left the footage at my house
3959.72 3984.92 speaker2  You can show them some of what we've got. Yeah, I'm sure I'll be like, what are you even doing in my office? The TikToks got deleted. What do you mean? I didn't want to worry you or anything, but I wanted to go to Richard's,
3982.68 3993.18 speaker4  Oh, I thought you were going to interview me.
3992.18 4003.20 speaker3  after you guys left.
4000.12 4020.38 speaker2  I mean, I was going to tell you, I kind of had forgotten, but I didn't want to tell you- He combed his hair. So that we didn't go to Richard's. I think, you know, somebody's been deleting the TikToks. Tyve is not happy with us. I think we got to go. I think we got to go talk to him.
4018.04 4028.40 speaker1  That adds a new wrinkle that, yeah, that sounds like he's maybe,
4026.78 4056.76 speaker2  this is track four, by the way. It's cheaper to keep her about our jobs, but I don't know, it sounds like he doesn't want us to do our jobs. If we get the footage, we could sell it to any news agency in the world. and do it here, though? If we don't act, we might never get it back.
4052.54 4068.36 speaker1  that if we can maybe do some creative talking to Tyve, maybe we'll get some resources that can help us with our actual goal. And we can just buy some time.
4064.72 4075.20 speaker2  if, you know, we don't really tell him exactly if he's on Godel's side, then.
4072.52 4081.46 speaker1  yeah, this is for the good of Godel.
4077.42 4110.60 speaker2  I didn't nearly die in that piss-shit common blood pit just to lose the evidence of it. I'm going to the natural hole. I'm getting my story. As both a player and as Julius, I am torn. Birds. I can't have me getting fired on my resume.
4109.28 4113.72 speaker3  Yeah, um.
4111.56 4117.56 speaker1  Yeah, I'll come, I'll come, Julius.
4115.60 4148.42 speaker2  but we just gotta check in with Tyve. I think he's gonna fire you anyway, Julius. Well. I think you tell him to go fuck himself. If you're gonna go. You'll get a job once you put out Beck, you should be there to document it. I can do it on my own. It's, it's just my uncle.
4145.06 4156.08 speaker1  I'm just, if Julius is saying that we need to go to Tyve, I don't, I don't know. It feels like maybe, maybe we should go see Tyve
4154.54 4165.62 speaker2  Call him again. Cal calls Tyve.
4164.76 4196.72 speaker3  How are you? Oh, well, not very great, Tyve. Yeah, get your ass down here. I got some great fucking news for you. You wanna be sitting at that head anchor desk again? It's promotion time, but I need you and Julius and Beck to come in. Why do you need us to come in? Because we have to do the paperwork for your new promotion, of course. I've got to tell you, Tyve, I don't care.
4195.42 4198.00 speaker2  I think the paperwork can wait.
4196.72 4202.80 speaker3  It's going to be great. I need you to come in now.
4201.56 4207.72 speaker2  Well, we'll see.
4206.38 4214.00 speaker3  So I want to give it to you, but I need you guys to come in.
4212.48 4226.92 speaker2  I don't know if I trust your word, if you actually care about your job here at the news, you're going to want to let us pursue this story. I love my job.
4224.72 4239.36 speaker3  And I need you to come in. So it's either that, or I think we're going to have to have some harsher words. Tyve?
4237.40 4249.64 speaker1  He's trying to muffle the receiver.
4246.86 4257.80 speaker2  I take it off my ear and like make a play show of putting it on mute. And he's like, I know about you.
4255.54 4269.20 speaker1  Dude, Cal, if he's offering to make you an anchor, that's a win-win for us because you'll have the desk. He can't tell you shit once you're live on air. We just run the footage. We're talking about to tape right now.
4268.16 4278.28 speaker2  But we don't have the tape. Or someone working with him. Or the people paying them both. Don't you see? Tyfe's in on it. Tyfe wants to kill it.
4277.12 4282.56 speaker1  I don't think you're wrong, but I also think that we can still make.
4280.52 4286.00 speaker2  The anchor job is never going to happen.
4283.62 4288.66 speaker1  Unless he wants to put you on anchor to shut you up and stop investigating.
4287.34 4296.00 speaker2  That's exactly what he wants. Don't you see?
4294.20 4298.76 speaker1  He can't control us outside of the office.
4297.24 4302.16 speaker2  We're outside of the office. He cannot control us.
4300.08 4308.56 speaker1  But I'm saying if we go now to the natural and he just does straight up fire us. So what? We post it on TikTok.
4307.20 4314.16 speaker2  We're locked out of the can TikTok. It keeps getting deleted. We'll make a cow TikTok.
4312.64 4331.80 speaker1  This is all things that they control. I think that they have the ability to take that stuff down. What I'm saying is that we have the chance to put this in front of eyeballs, no matter who tells you no. Once we get you on air live.
4330.48 4337.64 speaker2  We can ship it to a dozen news agencies. We can put it live on as many platforms as possible. It's not live then though.
4335.08 4344.54 speaker1  It's all to tape and they get to decide when they run it. Yeah.
4343.72 4406.60 speaker2  Are you coming? Your uncle is not looking out for your best interests and your career will live beyond this, especially if you're part of the most legendary news story of all time. The movie's happening in this car, Julius. He looks at Cloud Atlas. It's one of my favorites, but if you ever want to be the kind of person who produces the next Cloud Atlas or runs City Action News or a national news station, this story is how you get your foot in that door, not your uncle. If he fires you, screw him. I'll give you every recommendation in the world. Ty fangs up. I think if I'm gonna do this, it's all about who, you know? And I don't want to be like a Snowden or something and get sent off because of the Godel company. I gotta go.
4404.44 4410.00 speaker1  Cal, you know I'm gonna follow you wherever we go,
4408.62 4415.38 speaker2  We're going two different ways, Beck. Who you go with is up to you. Julius orders a Uber.
4413.64 4418.40 speaker1  Yeah, no, Cal, I'm your cameraman.
4416.56 4467.38 speaker2  I'll make sure he doesn't fire you. Julius, don't go. A tear runs down Julius's eye as he waits for the car to stop and gets out. He looks at the... What are you waiting for? My Harry Anderson juke. Julius is crying too.
4464.82 4528.90 speaker3  to the city action news station. You get out and you head in over that marbled, marvelous floor, head upstairs. As you make your way upstairs, you see the door to your Uncle Ty Frailand's office is closed and you hear whistling and when you open up the door, you see standing behind his desk, your Uncle Ty Frailand. looking back toward you is a tall, mousy police officer wearing glasses and a short, jacked, bald police officer.
4527.74 4561.30 speaker2  That's right. Nice.
4560.46 4569.14 speaker3  And when you pull up-
4567.50 4576.80 speaker4  It is straight for the natural.
4574.08 4616.46 speaker3  When you head to the northeast corner, you see that there is a subway station there. over their eyes, covering their nose,
4614.70 4651.02 speaker4  Beck is waving to you. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. It's great, and it's all my fault. Cause my life is great, and it's all mine. Cause my life is great.
4649.34 4665.12 speaker3  I feel so seen right now.
4664.30 4665.12 speaker4  Nothing. It's all my fault.
