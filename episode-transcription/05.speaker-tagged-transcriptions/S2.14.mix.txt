I have stumbled upon a strange box in the cellar of Duke Arthur, out of which your lovely voice comes. is very entertaining while I weave blankets for the coming winter. I pray you are not one of the wolves that come to prey on us in our dark days.
83.72 120.52 speaker0  Well, Mistress Yachty, I cannot guarantee It brings me back to my less omniscient days. be like Mistress Yachty.

165.68 202.84 speaker0  to no one in particular, tell them it's time for the news. Last time, the can crew was arrested for the murder of the mayor of Grover's Gorge, Sandro the Turtle. With the trial in the gang's immediate future, Vernon Covington, the landlord, led the cuffed crew to the It Pit,
198.64 208.12 speaker1  scrawled ceaselessly on its dimly lit walls.
205.36 280.80 speaker0  through the open metal cellar doors, There, the city action news team attacked, Of the It Pit.
275.80 299.36 speaker2  I love being in all the blood and cum.
296.64 337.72 speaker3  So you guys have had a week to look over this symbol. What do you make of it? and needs serious help. from when I was a kid and came across this and was like season two, baby. Made by her. This came out of the mind of a very disturbed child. I might've turned 30 this year, but I take it.
336.20 360.40 speaker2  Like Thomas. Thomas loves you when I talk like this.
358.36 366.12 speaker3  that was all about rum
364.60 372.52 speaker2  And everyone clapped.
369.08 381.52 speaker3  They all stood up and cheered for me. They chanted, cum, cum, cum, cum. I had some of the copy that I wasn't gonna put in there
379.48 383.60 speaker2  was young, dumb and full of rum.
381.52 404.60 speaker3  And she's like, that is so gross. What about like rum in my mouth? I thought you meant like you made a movie poster for the cum diary.
403.76 414.80 speaker2  Yeah, cum.
413.96 424.12 speaker3  Classic.
421.92 429.84 speaker2  that you mentioned that this was a hammer. or like a music stadium.
429.00 432.64 speaker3  I like that, yeah. But it could be a hammer too,
430.84 434.92 speaker2  especially with the square up there.
432.64 439.12 speaker3  It just looked more like that than an upside down cross, which is literally one of the examples.
435.76 455.04 speaker2  Or if you zoom in, it's a basketball goal. no, you said stupid scribblings. I like the episode starting with the four of you.
452.72 483.80 speaker3  That's not the part I don't say about. Just standing, like the episode starts with the four like a basketball goal? Yeah, I enjoy looking at shapes and clouds, but this is neither the time nor place.
481.84 494.00 speaker2  Like I was seeing red for a second there, guys. I'm sorry I lost my cool dudes.
489.48 496.80 speaker3  I went somewhere else when I got in this pit.
495.72 498.16 speaker2  Where did you go?
496.80 509.96 speaker3  In my mine palace. Oh, what's that? Don't you have one?
507.92 516.28 speaker2  but you have one in your mind?
513.52 523.20 speaker3  She looks up and one of the doors is open
521.04 536.24 speaker2  So there's potential here.
532.80 549.24 speaker3  I was thinking I got that clicker that opens all the windows in that place. Is there a clicker for these handcuffs? Well, we should probably search this corpse, right? Not corpse, but- Almost lifeless body. But this shell, yeah.
547.68 564.68 speaker2  This shell of a human. he's pretty easily able to go through and find a key to unlock all of your handcuffs.
562.48 591.22 speaker3  Thank you, Julius, for setting us free. Now here's my proposition. Oh, that feels so much better. Okay, yeah, what's up? but what if we just scream and yell for help? Say he attacked us
590.40 608.12 speaker2  I was gonna mention, it seemed like you even had maybe a vendetta against this guy. There may be like other people who feel that way, and this is gonna be like a, hail Godel, the wicked landlord is dead situation.
605.16 615.04 speaker3  Yes, a Godel come back to the people to save them from the grip of the horrid landlord.
613.36 620.52 speaker2  Does that mean that they would assume that I was down here the whole time?
618.72 625.64 speaker3  I don't think so. Everyone saw you. Oh, right, duh. Oh, shit, yeah, that's my bad.
624.28 642.92 speaker2  That's true, Cal, yeah. I think we- I swear. Wait, no, but they saw Stevie. Let's see if like you're a totally different person. Yeah, take your glasses off.
641.36 662.76 speaker3  Boing, boing, boing, boing. Classic 90s rom-com. so he tucks it back in.
659.68 667.76 speaker2  That's a great, I was wondering that the whole time.
664.88 688.88 speaker3  that we couldn't quite reach the top or? Oh, we could just- We can just climb out. Force ourselves out. You guys could just hop off my shoulders. That's true, you're like a mighty tripod.
686.64 693.32 speaker2  and like it makes it look like we're like hapless and don't wanna be.
690.76 699.28 speaker3  Oh, I think it's still a good idea, but it wouldn't be necessary for our escape.
697.68 703.16 speaker2  for people to see us in this hole and that we didn't like run away when they-
701.80 714.04 speaker3  Oh yes, and then in that case, we should scream and call for help because I don't want to wait in this hole
711.56 725.52 speaker2  That is, I mean, yeah, that's kind of in Stevie's court. Like how do you think this plan works?
723.20 750.44 speaker3  and find us with our jailer. Julius gets his phone out and turns the flashlight on and looks at what's actually down here
749.12 769.22 speaker2  How big a room are we in? How many of my arm spans would it take to hit the next wall? Holy shit. Yeah, like 20 yards by 20 yards-ish.
768.40 824.22 speaker3  Like the station wagon. Car nose down. Like car sardines, yeah. After Julius kinda like flashes his flashlight around a little bit, he is kind of like pushing Cal to stand in front of one of these symbols and he like flips over to TikTok. I could just get like a still image to put in the TikTok later or do you wanna describe anything? up over the pit. I get that with the symbol in the background.
820.74 834.44 speaker2  but is there any remains that are more intact around here? Is there anybody else in here? Is this a pit that's been holding other prisoners? So there's like 40 other, no. There's no one else down here.
832.42 839.34 speaker3  They were all cheering wildly.
835.54 863.30 speaker2  Priti Press, Priti Press, Priti Press. Oh, hey guys. No, there's no one else down here. of down here, what?
861.86 868.88 speaker3  Oh, I'm thinking of left behind.
867.80 910.12 speaker2  Nope, I didn't. There's like, there's no- Well, you nailed it. It's hot shirtless dudes. God's jealous. He left them all behind. You guys are looking around and there are no like intact human bodies down here, but there are seemingly pieces of body parts down here. And as you pick through, you also, I mean, if you're, are you like picking through at this point or? and doing a like red or a yellow versus green kind of thing. Oh, okay, yeah, cool.
908.66 937.66 speaker3  Everybody roll search. 40 on a 70, pass. Three pieces of information. Julius. Yeah, you each write down three things and we'll decide which of the six are the best.
936.82 945.52 speaker2  Yeah. Yeah, so as Julius is like,
942.02 959.04 speaker3  of what's all in here and then he stumbles on. It's like a ear. It's like a weird,
954.04 964.72 speaker2  And it seems to have fur on the outside of it. That doesn't quite narrow it down.
962.44 977.20 speaker3  Does it, it's human ear shaped?
973.76 994.66 speaker2  and it's kind of sticking out from within this just layer of disgusting gloop that's down here. And Beck Wilder, as you're going through, just kind of looking around with your cell phone light, you see that. They took the camera away from him? They took the camera away from him.
993.84 1006.20 speaker3  Oh no. Remember they put it in a bag. It's the worst anyway. Right, in my mind the bag was on his back for some reason.
1004.08 1012.60 speaker2  and so it is just right above you. Outside of. Like he set it down outside the doors.
1011.44 1015.52 speaker3  Oh, okay. So it's just right up there. I'm glad that.
1014.68 1026.60 speaker2  You can smell it, Beck. Mostly dead. Face up, but pretty rough.
1024.28 1032.64 speaker3  Face up in the muck. I turn him face down. He says nothing at all.
1030.88 1067.96 speaker2  He's almost dead. a piece of cloth actually sticking up out of the muck here. And as you grab it, it seems to be some sort of like, yeah, it's a jumpsuit and it's. Is it red? It's red. Monochromatic. Oh, holy shit. Damn.
1065.44 1070.16 speaker3  Your brain just made a connection on accident.
1067.96 1085.16 speaker2  I wish, but it's not. It is a monochromatic jumpsuit. We went over this. It's a gray scale jumpsuit, but.
1084.20 1097.56 speaker3  Purple.
1095.76 1124.04 speaker2  Cal vomits like in suspense. Anyone who's either one of you. I got it in my notes. The purple Jackalope, purple ribbon Jackalope Fox removed it from that Jackalope and walked away. Dang straight.
1122.32 1130.60 speaker4  And that Fox dude like took it off. He was condemned to death,
1129.64 1141.24 speaker3  That was a joke.
1140.40 1166.96 speaker2  That was good. Thank you, Stevie. Yeah, that was solid. I guess they kept, I was expecting this place to be full. This is where they kept the twenties. The twenties? as the twenties.
1166.12 1179.88 speaker3  Meaning what? Furry ears?
1174.88 1202.02 speaker2  And as she says that, Cal, you find the matching ear. So it's like the other ear from the one that Julius found. And do any of you have like biology, any science, any animal knowledge? If not, I'll take a intelligence at like a negative 20.
1197.72 1208.08 speaker3  and peers into it for some whisper of its secrets. And fails. He drops the ear back into the book.
1207.12 1214.16 speaker4  You said a negative 20? Yeah. That's a 49 on what would be a 50. Nice.
1211.88 1219.88 speaker3  I got a 91, so I don't win. So they're holding up these things and you walk up with the...
1218.64 1231.00 speaker4  Uh-huh.
1227.04 1246.32 speaker2  it's very clear that, yeah, it seems to... It's like fox ears, but they're bigger. Yeah, like they are the ears of a fox, but it would be a massive fox. So you're just really leaning in
1245.40 1252.94 speaker3  Always have been.
1252.10 1261.18 speaker4  Oh, duh.
1259.46 1306.92 speaker2  succeeded on your rolls, I'm gonna go ahead and give you one final thing. Because I thought of something. as you pulled it out, you see that there's actually a small piece of paper sticking up out of this muck where it had clearly been buried and you might not have even found it if you hadn't gotten the second ear, but underneath you see this little bit I look to see what's on the paper. No, you don't. I'm standing right over it.
1306.10 1314.00 speaker3  Yeah. Shut the fuck up. This is my paper.
1312.86 1324.78 speaker2  I dive for the paper.
1323.70 1330.06 speaker3  I read the paper.
1327.78 1334.46 speaker2  you're gonna have to kind of get some of the muck and gunk off of it.
1333.00 1347.86 speaker3  Read this nasty paper for me. after I scraped some muck off. It's like a small business card
1345.46 1372.48 speaker2  And it says the occult and unnatural investigative journalism association. Shout out to Intrepid T over on Discord, one of our $10 and up patrons over at patreon.com slash pretending pod for giving us the occult and unnatural investigative journalism association. What do you think about that, Cal?
1371.28 1377.70 speaker3  Ouija. O-U-I-J-A.
1375.30 1384.38 speaker4  No, that obviously spells Ouija. Oh, yeah.
1382.74 1390.02 speaker3  I was like, oh, it doesn't mean anything. So it'd be funny to say like, Ouija. O-U-I-J-A. O-U-I-J-A.
1389.08 1391.82 speaker4  And I'm like, wait.
1390.02 1399.94 speaker2  Do you think that Intrepid T knew what they were doing when they wrote this? Nope.
1398.10 1402.30 speaker3  A Bob Ross situation.
1399.94 1411.70 speaker4  It's so wild he picked out that collection of words. Did he even know?
1407.94 1419.00 speaker3  This is our original campaign notebook full of notes. What's it say?
1415.52 1421.52 speaker2  Yeah, before we recorded, it was all pretty boring.
1420.68 1453.08 speaker3  Nice. Bright light and immense noise. The dust begins to crawl, then fly. The cave is full of lice. They investigate Bigfoot and other nonsense.
1450.16 1469.84 speaker4  I mean, but do we like have proof, you know? Like, did you see it?
1468.48 1501.34 speaker2  to answer all these questions, but the 20s are what we called them because it was roughly, you know how Greg got got? He was Greg and now he's Fox. Yeah, it's kind of like mind control. But basically when he does it, there's probably like a 20% chance that it just, It just kind of does this to you.
1500.10 1509.36 speaker3  with the mind of a child.
1507.06 1530.94 speaker2  Yeah, I mean, you just talk and talk and talk, but nothing of substance ever really comes out, just yammering on and on about some tower, getting God back to heaven. It's just, they just talk and talk. I mean, I thought that we were gonna be surrounded. I was ready for a different kind of fight, honestly,
1529.60 1535.36 speaker3  Don't worry, in a very real way, they're still with us.
1532.94 1539.20 speaker4  Yeah, my camera's up there, dude.
1537.96 1557.70 speaker3  Let's go get our camera. and puts his hands down, ready to lift people up and out.
1552.70 1567.06 speaker2  Each time, I'm gonna make sure Luke passes his before you have a good shot at yours.
1564.30 1576.98 speaker3  29 out of 50, pass on the second one. Fail on the third one.
1575.66 1580.70 speaker2  Well, what we're gonna do here-
1576.98 1583.42 speaker3  Also, both my fails would have still failed with 20 more.
1581.54 1590.16 speaker2  I meant plus 30.
1587.86 1597.42 speaker3  I got 90s and 80s.
1592.86 1614.26 speaker2  but you do have time, whoever is last is gonna be the one who might get stuck, and that's gonna be the difficult place to be in. like helping everyone up out, then you would be the last one that they're gonna try to pull you up.
1612.94 1623.14 speaker3  I think that's the plan, though.
1618.42 1642.86 speaker2  you're easily able to get Beck, Cal, and Stevie up out of the it pit. They're all three looking down at you in this vile, disgusting, absolutely wretched, like it's hard not to throw up while you're still down. And we just walk away. You can't get used to it.
1638.22 1648.10 speaker3  To get a little higher up, I would like to sit Vernon up against the wall and stand on his shoulders
1645.26 1661.66 speaker2  to have a couple more feet closer to the wall. That's fucking role playing. That is Liam Neeson, Ra's al Ghuling, being aware of your surroundings, and that will get you out of here without rolling. Hell yeah. But we probably need to try to roll.
1659.78 1713.62 speaker3  Should we roll to retrieve him? Fucking leave him in there. I think this is the best place for him right now. nobody might hear him, because we're gonna shut the door behind us, for sure. Should we run screaming into the town now, saying help, help, help. The former does seem like the better, But our very lives depend on it, and so does the information we carry in our minds now, and on Beck's precious camera.
1711.22 1725.20 speaker4  Oh yeah, it's out of the bag and back to filming.
1722.58 1731.92 speaker3  Do you think we could just go to Greg's and see if we can't get some help?
1729.96 1751.20 speaker2  what was happening with us. If he's just at his house, he hasn't been paying attention to anything, so he wouldn't even know that we're heading to trial, and she looks at her phone, and she's like, in like half an hour.
1749.44 1766.56 speaker3  we could have just called 911? in case he thinks maybe we can.
1764.60 1776.28 speaker4  I'm using my flashlight, Your battery is draining to nothing.
1773.04 1779.04 speaker3  I'm gonna go with a solid, there's no way, but.
1777.56 1784.04 speaker4  up until we got sentenced to death, so right now exploring that option is probably.
1781.84 1794.68 speaker3  The giant statues are just cell towers.
1792.88 1804.66 speaker4  that was maybe important, and then I forgot. It was pretty important. I hit a breaking point.
1803.74 1810.28 speaker2  What was your question?
1807.12 1843.78 speaker3  what I wrote down as my phobia or whatever. This is what I had. and the next one was grip colon in a different note, and I just never wrote it down. With no number, amazing. But I knew it was something to do with that, and that makes sense. Good to go. It's from July 5th. Grip. Oh.
1842.94 1853.68 speaker2  Okay, cool. Well, let's have Luke and Thomas take off your headphones real quick, and Joe, let's.
1852.68 1879.24 speaker4  Oh, good, cool. Just viscera and gore and gross gore. Gross gore. Like beyond just blood. Yeah. Or crazy designs. I like, I. Joe, the player, loves investigating crazy designs. Yeah. Yeah. Or if you got something else.
1877.76 1885.64 speaker2  Yeah, yeah. I think that.
1883.52 1903.56 speaker4  was what made me, my sanity broke, and I had a fight response, if you want it to be fight related. Okay, yeah, yeah. It was the least likely thing I had put. I rolled a one to get it. Okay, yeah. What about? Yeah. Oh, yeah.
1901.30 1916.30 speaker2  Or like, I guess that's a little strange, maybe, I don't know. Or heights, you could also do heights. Like falling? Yeah. But I like either of the first two that you came up with, so I'll. I like the ones you said, though.
1915.32 1933.64 speaker4  I mean. I'll defer to you. I'm between the heights, the suit, and the blood, because I don't. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree with you. if we ever look at it again. We'll all cut out heights. Okay, so suits or viscera?
1932.56 1934.48 speaker2  because either one.
1933.64 1953.76 speaker4  Yeah. One, two, three is blood. Four, five, six is the other one. I mean, that's great. That's good for Beck as a character.
1952.52 1959.92 speaker2  you're gonna need to. Am I gonna have to fight every person in a suit? Well, you're gonna need to work on maybe Julius and Kal.
1959.08 1966.48 speaker4  Oh, fuck. I forgot I was surrounded by men in suits.
1964.84 1972.92 speaker2  Yeah, they both wear those,
1969.28 1989.52 speaker4  I was picturing just running into maybe some of the Godels. Nope, it's everybody around me. Ouchie, ouchie. So, okay, then I need to clarify with you right now, like how extreme is this? Is it a phobia, would you call it? Yeah. I'm scared of the suit.
1987.46 1992.32 speaker2  Yeah, scared of the suit, I suppose. Yeah.
1990.34 1998.76 speaker4  And then if I have them remove their jackets, would that be enough for me? Yeah, I think so.
1997.60 2003.56 speaker2  It takes the power away.
2001.64 2009.52 speaker4  Okay, but okay, yeah. But okay. I just don't know how, like, when I go.
2006.48 2026.04 speaker2  I mean, literally, let's say as soon as you get up out of the pit and you're looking at them for the first time, and they're also covered in this stuff, like he was when you attacked him, you're gonna need them to change how they look pretty quickly, yeah.
2023.90 2032.80 speaker4  But it's, yeah, it's just an uncomfortable thing for me. Like, it's not gonna make me lash out at them, per se. No, but I think that you need
2030.76 2036.00 speaker2  to be pretty intense about it. Cool, yeah, I get that.
2033.92 2042.04 speaker4  I just mean, like, if I run into my, like, if I run into his thief, if I run into Typh, am I gonna be angry with him?
2040.76 2042.88 speaker2  I think you're just gonna be weird.
2042.04 2046.20 speaker4  Exactly, that's what I mean.
2042.88 2054.60 speaker2  Yes, weird, stilted, like, no eye contact, not cool-ass fucking Beck like you used to be. I'm all about it. Women in non-binary, women in non-binary people
2053.08 2076.92 speaker4  in suits are fine. I dig it. You should check the recording, make sure we're still recording after the lights blinked. Luke, you can take your ears out.
2075.04 2082.12 speaker3  Dude, it is going nutso.
2080.56 2094.00 speaker4  that you can then loop whenever you need to. Yeah.
2092.76 2113.08 speaker3  Famous last podcast.
2111.40 2120.08 speaker2  brought me to thinking about Thor, which brought me to thinking about Norse mythology,
2119.24 2133.38 speaker4  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thinking about Sandman, anybody started watching that on Netflix?
2132.54 2137.80 speaker3  Is it good?
2135.74 2146.06 speaker4  I thought it was a really cool first episode and it makes, I've never read the book, so I'm intrigued as to what is gonna happen.
2144.20 2165.24 speaker3  I just like, when it came out, I was like, I'm not in the mood to watch something like this because I wanted to watch something stupid. Is his name Morpheus or Morby? I read the description and it was something like that.
2163.26 2169.10 speaker4  cause he is the God of like dreams,
2168.06 2176.86 speaker2  In real life?
2174.58 2205.08 speaker3  based off the Morbintime meme and then they produced a show and released it? Maybe. Yeah, Joe's eyes just went white and he floated in the air for a second and he said that weird shit. I think it was a prophecy.
2204.24 2212.80 speaker4  All right. We're all out of the hole at this point.
2209.56 2232.70 speaker2  looking down at the slumped body of Vernon Covington, the landlord, which Julius Summers has just used along with your help to get up out of the it pit.
2231.86 2245.04 speaker3  That was wild. Yeah, you're gonna have plenty of options of thunder samplings.
2242.04 2255.04 speaker2  looks at Cal and Julius, but with something different in his eyes.
2250.78 2273.52 speaker4  Hey, what's up, what's up, what's up fellas? It sure is hot today. Boy, howdy, you guys look like you're real hot. Would you guys want to take off your coats, please?
2271.80 2276.96 speaker3  It's covered in shit and blood. I was planning on removing it anyway.
2275.68 2294.68 speaker4  Yeah, there you go. They're dirty. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
2292.28 2309.48 speaker2  like come out all. Yeah, whether we're going to go to Greg's GIZ or whether we're going to come out and say like, hey, what's up, we're back. We're ready for our trial now, please. Or we can get the fuck out of here.
2307.36 2315.44 speaker3  Stevie, do the people of Grover's Gorge know about the It Pit?
2314.60 2325.58 speaker2  All of them? Yeah. Do they know what it's like in there? Yeah, I think they do, Cal.
2322.34 2337.90 speaker3  what we ultimately want to do before we go down any of these avenues, aren't we?
2334.94 2351.94 speaker4  like is there a chance that we're looked favorably upon because of this landlord situation? Like maybe he's an asshole and everybody was like, thank God he's gone. Yeah, I mean, Fred definitely won't like it
2348.94 2380.34 speaker2  until, I mean, they definitely told him that Sandro died. Like they definitely told him that Sandro died, so. Was that just a turtle Not functionally the mayor of this town, but pretty importantly, the mayor of this town. In like a community pride sense
2377.42 2385.30 speaker3  or in some weird dark forces way.
2382.30 2396.30 speaker2  I'm gonna sound really out of control here while I'm talking, but just know that this is really out there.
2395.34 2410.34 speaker3  Quiet, Julius. Stevie was just about to tell us about the spooky shit going on with the turtle. Yeah.
2407.42 2420.30 speaker2  I didn't, you saw, you saw it?
2415.30 2448.64 speaker3  It was, I mean, it sounded like it was talking too, but not anything, not real words or words that I could understand. And when I saw it, I got this taste in my mouth, just salt, salty, saline. You saw God?
2446.16 2461.56 speaker4  but it like wasn't that, dude. I mean, what?
2457.32 2473.92 speaker2  and is like, I kind of always thought that it wasn't real. Like there was some other explanation for all of this, but I'm starting to fucking freak out, man.
2471.60 2488.88 speaker3  Listen to me, look at me, look into my eyes.
2486.04 2504.02 speaker2  No, right, that's not God, but then what is it? It did everything. I mean, it's like, it's like gave him all the power. It's like, what did you, you saw it too, Beck?
2501.84 2532.40 speaker4  and like go into Chuck. Did you see it go into Chuck? To me, I didn't like quite see like, it didn't look human to me exactly. And like, I didn't hear anything unless I didn't ask the right questions. Dude, like to me, it was just like, somebody like shot a super soaker out of the turtle into Chuck.
2529.14 2540.72 speaker3  Now someone, I thought the turtle leaped to its death, but someone shot a super soaker at it?
2538.70 2558.00 speaker4  You remember how it like leapt off the edge, right? Yes. So then the super soaker came out up from beneath like where that, like where it would have probably like impacted is what like, I like inferred or whatever. And it like shot up and over and like into Chuck.
2553.30 2561.70 speaker3  The humanoid talking, tasting energy went into Chuck and he exploded through the glass.
2560.02 2568.30 speaker4  See, I didn't see like a humanoid thing. I just saw like a super soaker blast, dude.
2566.28 2571.58 speaker3  How many fingers am I holding up?
2569.86 2575.50 speaker4  Yeah, I'm counting five, my dude.
2573.40 2583.16 speaker3  you could still be trusted with the news.
2581.42 2594.38 speaker4  is that I didn't film this. I was startled. Remind Joe, I think I said that there was something else that startled me at the time, right?
2590.26 2598.42 speaker2  Well, you were shooting the deep healing that was happening. I think even Julius grabbed your camera or something.
2597.14 2620.66 speaker4  There was some reason that I remember it like jostled down to the ground. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, like it's not there, dude. It's not in the footage. Fuck. I got the aftermath, because you remember when Chuck went through that window? Like that was why he got pushed through that window.
2618.28 2621.94 speaker3  God turtle, Godel, God, is there something in there?
2620.66 2632.30 speaker4  God turtle. Cal, you fucking figured it out, my dude. God turtle, Godel, God turtle, God turtle, God turtle.
2631.46 2643.38 speaker3  But still. We don't want to reveal our position just yet. Is that why you're named Godel?
2642.06 2665.54 speaker2  I don't think so.
2664.30 2688.04 speaker4  I mean, it's probably ancient times they've been worshiping the Godel turtle. It's ancient, man. Stevie, like maybe you're figuring this out for the first time.
2686.86 2719.42 speaker2  This is amazing. Total, total.
2717.90 2732.90 speaker3  on their property. If we can even leave, it might be time to start preparing our defense.
2729.30 2742.98 speaker2  And if we leave, I'll try to help.
2737.98 2769.06 speaker3  Personally, my vote is stay and risk our lives Why would your uncle say that? thinking about leaving this place.
2766.82 2780.50 speaker2  You're willing to risk all of our lives for it? Precisely. Oh. Oh. Yeah, I mean, I-
2777.94 2810.30 speaker4  that is a little bit Julius in here, that this is footage that nobody's ever seen before. What else could we maybe get? We could do a whole documentary special and you'd win the Pulitzer for this, dude.
2807.42 2812.22 speaker3  Beck, you should know, this is a very bad idea.
2810.30 2818.76 speaker4  No, yeah, for sure, for sure, for sure.
2815.22 2827.02 speaker3  pictures of you with famous people? You could be one of those people
2824.86 2832.16 speaker2  I am one of those people, Julius.
2830.34 2845.02 speaker3  And I won't if I leave with all we have. And I won't follow you to this death. Julius just looks at Beck.
2842.76 2851.66 speaker4  Beck does, part of him really still wanna stay in film, but I mean, I guess this place isn't going anywhere. Like, could we come back with maybe like?
2850.38 2875.74 speaker3  We can come back with. A bigger crew or whatever? An armed federal escort. by the federal government. What we have now is enough to make that happen. Julius just kind of nods his head. He absolutely still would like to stay and shoot more, but he knows that this is a team and that he has basically been outvoted and so he's not gonna argue anymore.
2874.08 2913.30 speaker2  Okay, the best way getting out of here is gonna be around the back of this factory and then we're gonna get into the trees. We're gonna take the tree line all the way to the big plant wall. We're gonna have our fucking teeth in that wall as we just crouch and kind of shuffle our way as quietly and as smoothly as possible. Across this plant wall all the way to the door. out of the view of the most people.
2909.80 2924.14 speaker3  Julius is a little bit happier knowing that he can leave with at least a cool escape TikTok.
2921.18 2944.22 speaker2  So just further east, just straight into the forest is where she pointed, like straight into this tree line, this thick tree line that's on the far east side and then going as far south as possible, like staying in the trees the entire way down to the plant wall and then walking across the plant wall over on the south side that you came in and finding that door and then getting out. The door that you came in.
2942.94 2950.40 speaker4  So we're going east into the woods and then south using the woods as cover. Got it, got it.
2947.28 2959.36 speaker3  Is there anywhere we could raid a supply closet or something for extra onesies? I like the green ones myself.
2957.08 2986.16 speaker2  or in the super nice GIZs. Yeah, I mean those would be here in the factory but I think we're risking a lot by trying to go in there. That'd be like a whole other episode probably. All the way across, like on the far other side, like the full west side or like the green, like all the EEs live on the super far west side.
2983.12 3001.28 speaker3  Did they leave some of their EE cummings in that pit? Oh, thank God.
2999.28 3007.78 speaker2  I like the ones where they grab that newspaper and black out a bunch of words
3006.94 3019.82 speaker3  That's fun. I like the one where this guy takes a piece of bologna and pokes a bunch of holes in it and then slaps it on a page and then that's the poem.
3016.62 3021.86 speaker2  Do you think he'd poke the holes first or afterward?
3019.82 3026.02 speaker3  Well, some of them don't work. So I think he just does it.
3025.18 3038.62 speaker2  That's how you know.
3037.78 3056.42 speaker4  Yeah. This footage now from Beck's camera is like when you're watching a documentary and shit hits the fan and it pans around and you see the boom operator is rolling out. You guys are in front of me and it's hazard. It's shaky cam. It's shaky cam.
3054.86 3057.26 speaker3  It's some Blair Witch Cloverfield.
3056.42 3065.00 speaker4  Going through the woods.
3062.74 3109.78 speaker2  So it is thick brush. He's at two hit points. So literally he's barely breathing. He's able to make all these points and stuff, but he mostly got hit in the face. Oh, that explains it. Yeah, it's not. I'm gonna die of a blood clot You look over at Julius and one of his eyes is completely filled with blood and it's starting to drip from the wrong corner, like not from his tear duct.
3108.06 3117.58 speaker3  like argued it in a good face instead of just being like, no, you idiot. Like, do you? We need to kill you. What?
3116.54 3140.10 speaker2  Yeah, like. There's a 50-50 chance that a punch would kill him. I can't punch him. because it's D4 minus one. Wait, so nope, that's, fuck.
3139.26 3170.54 speaker3  Yeah. Oh, so one, yeah, you're right. Fuck. Anyway, don't punch me. I'll take a minute. This would be a really bad place to drive a four-wheeler. I don't understand the reference. Julius doesn't either. Stevie pats you on the back.
3169.70 3173.34 speaker2  He's Frank Gotthold.
3172.10 3177.06 speaker4  I mean, Caesar, I mean. I mean, fuck.
3176.20 3186.02 speaker2  Oh yeah, we're walking. We finally get to the big plant wall.
3183.94 3199.70 speaker3  Shimmy, shimmy, y'all, shimmy, y'all, shimmy. I'm gonna get in behind and TikTok them walking however they're gonna be walking.
3196.64 3214.50 speaker2  So I need everyone to roll stealth.
3213.66 3223.50 speaker3  And I got a three.
3220.90 3232.56 speaker2  for just like all of Grover's gorge. And Luke, will you check out what I rolled there?
3231.10 3243.62 speaker3  He rolled a 100. So they are all taking a big long blink.
3240.52 3249.66 speaker2  Like 80% as an entire city? Like for someone to see. We're only in part of the city and the part
3248.74 3251.98 speaker3  that's best to hide in.
3249.66 3333.70 speaker2  Well, then it's a great thing for everyone that I rolled a 100 just now. Holy shit. As you guys hit the door, creak it open and take one last look out at Grover's gorge. are not paying you any mind. You see Chuck Bidwell, bright blue eyes, face lined by the sun, topped by a tight flat top of salt and pepper hair stocky, the muscle of his youth turned fat. is absolutely drenched, wet, soaking as he walks through Grover's gorge. You grab the door, close it shut. Click on the other side. And you guys are standing, looking out at the massive gorge that you saw when you arrived. Fog is filling up this enormous gorge. And you see that the train, the single steel train car is sitting Just how it was the last time you were here.
3330.62 3367.84 speaker3  And he says, Julius, put that fucking phone away and get on the train. Julius gets up flush with the train and is gonna tick-tock you guys walking into the train and then get in the train. since he's been here.
3366.72 3584.96 speaker2  What's up everybody? I'm Zach. And that fun isn't going to stop, but it is gonna slow down a bit. Putting the show out mostly weekly for almost three years now has been my pleasure. And I'm tired. It's been affecting my mood for the past month or six, which sucks. And I want this show to continue to be a pleasure to create. And I don't want the quality of the show to suffer. So in order for that to happen, we're going to move to an every other Friday release schedule. Now the goal is to get back to weekly episodes. So I've reached out to someone who can help lighten my load on the editing side of things by cleaning up the tracks of debris before I finish them off. But that process will take time to smooth out and it will expedite the process, but it'll still take time and money. So with our eyes set on getting back to weekly, we've got two new Patreon goals. The first is at $5,785, which is of course $69,420 over the year. At this first goal, pretending to be people will move from every other Friday releases to three episodes per month, dropped on the first, 11th, and 21st. The Patreon goal to go back to weekly releases is set at, you guessed it, $6,942 per month. And when we hit the PTBP radio frequency, we'll be once again swaddled I also bring three fun announcements. First, we recently recorded another side story for season two, and we had another mind-blowingly talented guest. Becca Scott joined us for a four episode modern Delta Green operation set in the city. She was fantastic. We were fantastic. I'm seriously, I'm so excited for y'all to hear it. It's nasty. Second, the Den of Sin will be live on Tuesday, October 25th for a very special Halloween episode. We'll be following Clark Bishop, John Lee Pettymore III, and Keith Vigna as kids at Clinkers Daycare as they go trick or treating in contention on what could not so canonically be their last Halloween ever. will be out before the November Den of Sin, which is the third and final cool thing. And November Thomas is going to kick off his Oops All Pettymore's Patreon campaign with a Pettymore family Thanksgiving. Joe, Luke, and I will all be playing members of the fam for the run, and we are really fucking excited about it. Okay, seriously, thank you so much for listening. This is a wildly cool thing to be a part of, and I really hope it continues to be fun, and rad, and sick, and twisted, because I like it. ["My Life Is Great"] ["My Life Is Great"]
3582.96 3608.24 speaker3  No, it's a very long gummy. But it's thin. You can only fold a fruit by the foot on itself eight times before. I think it needs a square, right? Yeah, any loser. And I say, hey, do you want to see how much I can bend you? Did it just lightning? Shut up, nerd. Shut up, nerd.
