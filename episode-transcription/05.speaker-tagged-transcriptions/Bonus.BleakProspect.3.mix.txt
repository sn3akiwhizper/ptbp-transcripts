0.00 17.16 speaker1  This is yet another introduction from your big boy Wolfie.
13.20 52.38 speaker0  Recorded live in front of a studio audience. And live in front of my producer, at least. Producer don't seem to talk too much these days, though. Speaking of my possibly deceased producer, who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod, which is a top notch internet move in my opinion.
49.76 67.92 speaker1  for the great work you put into this pod. It has brought me an immense amount of joy and comfort. Zach, your world building and storytelling is top class.
63.32 92.08 speaker0  And to our dear PCs, your characters always managed PS, to everyone, winter is coming. Love each other and remember your vitamin D.
89.32 106.00 speaker1  The only pod I know about is the ones
102.96 126.44 speaker0  They will probably devour us all rather quickly
123.20 139.48 speaker1  or write a five star review and shoot us an email. or trapped by a sleeping pet right now,
138.56 145.76 speaker0  Get on it.
143.64 192.52 speaker1  because it's time to get scary. I don't want to be gruff or forward, THEME SONG
189.28 214.32 speaker2  presume is Astin Hawkes' laboratory. something perhaps moving in liquid towards the back. There are indistinct shapes in the gloom, but there really isn't enough light to work out what anything is.
212.44 264.60 speaker3  just in case you want to recheck your pockets with another luck roll for those flashlights? and has worked in the dark many, many times and has learned to rely on his keen sense of ears as well as smell. And so he is going to try to really dig past his inability to see, to make out anything else that's going on in this room. has a lighter in there. OK, well, give me a luck roll.
261.28 267.52 speaker2  You do have your trusty old Zippo in there.
264.60 285.88 speaker3  I see Frederick making some weird faces, like sniffing around and trying to hear, and I flip that on like this, this might help. I passed my listen roll, so I hear the lighter.
283.56 340.60 speaker2  identify where that sound is coming from. And sure enough, as you've got a bit of light in there and it's a lighter, so it's not lighting up the whole room, but as Dr. Rothstein mixes way in a bit, you can make out details and you can see a glint at the back of glass and metal, and you reckon the sound you heard of something moving in liquid came from have, it looks, well, maybe not quite like a fish tank, but certainly, you know, there's more metal on it than a fish tank. But there's glass windows and it definitely looks like some kind of large tank that's holding of equipment on them, including more of these cylinders and forceps and gloves and aprons and stuff like that.
340.28 343.68 speaker3  Good.
340.60 352.80 speaker2  Yeah, we should stock up on all of those, all
347.76 359.96 speaker3  man. Do we see any light fixtures?
356.16 409.88 speaker2  There is also something that looks like an electrical wiring loom with all sorts of equipment. And yeah, you're not quite sure initially what it is, or maybe with a bit of time, Dr. Rothstein could work it out. But what looks like some fairly complicated electronics just covering an entire part of the wall on this loom. And there is a bigger knife switch that's there and a few controls. the floor. The floor is flag stoned, but there is this big ring of metal of some kind, maybe copper, that seems to have all these strange somehow to this electrical loom.
409.48 417.76 speaker3  Yes. Or does it kind of run around the room indiscriminately?
415.60 423.96 speaker2  the room. All the other equipment, everything else is outside that circle. Cool, yeah.
423.52 457.56 speaker3  repair? 60%. Dope. I was hoping it was higher than mine because I actually pulled 50 in it because I thought Frederick Mellon might have cut people's power when he went to rob them, you know, gotten adept at handling that kind of stuff. But then I was like, Oh, no, what if I Did you? No. ceiling directly above it? No, it's just on the floor. Good question.
455.00 481.00 speaker2  Rothstein in particular can work out fairly quickly, I guess, that there is no power source in this room. But obviously, you saw those cables going off to the other outbuildings. And, you know, it probably makes sense to you that those must be external generators.
479.76 528.36 speaker3  Do you think this here is that? I mean, if anything was a portal, that would be it. Don't you believe? I mean, when you think of portal, you think of that, don't you? I don't have a great sci-fi horror frame of reference at this point in history. This is real life. So I didn't know. looks like a portal. I think it is. Frederick Mellon is like standing in the middle middle of the circle back on the other side.
524.60 540.16 speaker4  the outside. Should we try to turn the power on? No, absolutely not.
538.16 551.00 speaker5  I thought we were going to send them back. No, I think we just light them on fire.
547.84 558.40 speaker3  wants to walk back further toward the tank and inspect it a little closer.
555.88 586.44 speaker2  the penumbra of Rothstein's Lighters, so it's fairly dark. But yeah, you get back there and yeah, there is some kind of dark liquid, probably water, maybe not, inside this tank. And in the little bit of light you have, you can
583.16 594.36 speaker3  before, or is it a wholly new thing to me?
592.04 600.68 speaker2  in the gloom.
597.04 608.16 speaker4  I pass a 7 on a 25. 25.
604.52 640.40 speaker2  that wriggle past do look like the specimens that you saw earlier, albeit larger versions. But there is something in that tank as well. You can't really make out the details a bit, but from the size and shape of it, it looks... No, it looks very, very different, paler and larger. And there are tendrils coming off it.
637.20 658.64 speaker4  like maybe they keep them here swimming around or something. There's another one. There's another thing in there. I don't know if it's like insects in our world. It's maybe it's queen or something.
658.16 661.48 speaker3  happens.
660.80 668.84 speaker2  Fuck.
667.08 697.76 speaker5  we're going to try to turn this thing on and send these things back to where they came from. So I guess we get ready to push over the tank into the big old copper circle and then two of us go to the generator rooms, flip on the the two left inside here push over the fish tank into the into the circle and then we'll turn it back off.
696.32 708.80 speaker4  We don't know a lot about this portal. We could turn it on and they come flooding out at us. I don't know if it's how it works. That's let's push that tank over.
706.28 721.20 speaker5  So I have to be one of the ones working in the electric city, which I have some experience with. So if they do come flooding out, that's a risk I'm willing to take. Rothstein, let's go. Sweet.
720.64 726.24 speaker3  on your own? I don't know.
725.04 730.16 speaker4  I'm not there.
728.08 753.16 speaker3  I just figured instead of counting to 50, I could I could be somewhere in the middle and I could let together at the same time. with you. Well, we'll know when the lights come on. I guess that they did their part and then we tip the tank over.
750.80 758.84 speaker4  going, they could just join us back in here. We still got to flip a switch on the machine, right?
758.48 764.68 speaker5  right?
764.16 771.72 speaker3  Okay.
768.00 777.64 speaker5  have, that we know what's going on with this and be like, oh yeah, fuck yeah, dude. All right, let's go. What?
776.80 784.52 speaker3  all humanity? Like, come on. I doubt it. Nothing mentioned, nothing gained.
781.84 806.60 speaker5  People like us don't have the power to change human history. They've told us that over and over our entire lives, they've let us know. shake up this. How old are you? I'm like 27. I'm 44.
804.80 811.48 speaker3  No, my character sheet says old.
810.76 813.28 speaker2  is that right?
812.76 819.68 speaker5  Okay. And I could do both now that we're not doing it at the same time. Sure.
817.72 826.72 speaker3  It's not like a pressure plate puzzle or anything, I don't think. Yeah.
824.92 845.36 speaker2  You can see that there are a few drums of diesel there as well. So, but there seems to be enough fuel in there that you fire up the generators and then, yeah, the lights inside the laboratory start flickering on.
841.76 852.44 speaker5  he's going to roll one of those tanks of diesel back to the lab.
850.84 861.08 speaker3  conflagration, I get you.
857.52 943.08 speaker2  you can see much better what's inside here. As I said, there's fairly complex a wiring loom with all sorts of weird stuff going on in there. You also see that there is a journal or at least a notebook of some kind on the bench as well. Pulling it over is going to be difficult because it is bolted to the stone wall. do look like this thing that Caspar Brink had There's something about it that reminds you of a monkey in the shape of it, but maybe a monkey that's been turned inside out. And it's floating there in the water. Its limbs do look more like tentacles than arms. Let's have a sanity roll off Dr. Coombs as he was the one taking an interest in the contents of the tank.
939.88 956.48 speaker4  I fail, a 93 on a 32. OK, so you lose a D4.
951.60 987.96 speaker2  Coombs, just cry out an alarm as the lights come on. And basically, he's been standing there trying to stare into this tank and all of a sudden he gets a really good look at what's on the other side of the glass and just staggers back and lands heavily on the ground. look at some of this equipment. leather-bound volume, at least, that's sitting on the workbench.
985.92 994.00 speaker3  What, are we going to read the journal like a bunch of nerds? Let's just flip the switch.
993.56 998.88 speaker4  OK. Ah, I thought you were quiet.
997.68 1026.72 speaker3  That's much better.
1022.44 1046.12 speaker2  I mean, you can skim it just to try to pick out the pertinent points. It's written in English, which isn't your first language. So if you're skimming it and trying to dig out the meaning, let's have a read English roll. Off you.
1045.68 1051.84 speaker3  Right.
1047.88 1094.84 speaker2  You're skimming through, but it's going to take you a bit more time to make sense of this. You could just sort of try to ignore the others around you and just really focus on digging this and push the roll. But I mean, you know, there's always the chance that you'll just catastrophically misunderstand what it's saying.
1092.84 1117.24 speaker3  Can we spend luck to fail the roll?
1115.04 1134.96 speaker2  Rothstein has got his nose in the book. What's Dolan doing?
1128.08 1150.12 speaker3  you can. But I bet his anxiety is like, doc, other doc, are you ready over there? Are we going to do this? So we're going to, what's going on? I'm reading.
1144.20 1169.00 speaker2  as he comes back towards the laboratory, is as you've turned the generator on, a few of the lights, not all of them, but a few of the lights in the main building have come on as well.
1165.00 1205.48 speaker5  He loves stealing, like from rich people specifically. And so he really wants to go up there, but better judgment says, ah, okay, let me at least check in with the boys. I'm so disappointed in you.
1201.00 1212.44 speaker4  then we, uh, we gotta, we gotta find a wrench guys that this thing's bolted to the wall. Okay.
1209.16 1214.84 speaker3  We, maybe we should pursue other options.
1214.64 1221.80 speaker4  Yeah.
1216.32 1238.56 speaker3  What if we, what if we break it and we create some kind of channel or funnel, uh, directly into the center of the portal? You know, just some planks or whatever that run to it.
1235.36 1261.20 speaker2  The, the ring in the floor is fairly large. It doesn't take up the whole room by any means, but yeah, I mean, there's still a few meters between the tank and the, the ring in the ground. Um, or at least just up to the edge of it. Yeah, perfect.
1256.12 1269.24 speaker4  And I point to the creature in the glass that that's, that looks, that looks a little, a little more mobile and dangerous. It's got, it's got, it's just floating there.
1268.44 1270.16 speaker3  He's having a good time.
1269.24 1281.96 speaker4  It's a happy monkey. then letting a monkey out into this room. That would not be good. I'd like to have a monkey friend. I don't
1280.64 1284.08 speaker3  monkeys are horrifying.
1282.44 1289.96 speaker5  Haven't you seen the move in pictures?
1289.52 1315.04 speaker3  monkey. That's opportunity right there. any moves.
1314.52 1321.88 speaker4  Eyes? What eyes?
1321.28 1324.20 speaker3  Yeah.
1322.08 1399.64 speaker2  So what Dr. Osteen is picking up from the book is you to remember Dr. Hawks was obsessed with the work of another physicist or an inventor who had also, well man called Crawford Tillinghast. And he'd created some kind of device that would shape human perceptions and allow people to see through to other dimensions of reality. But what Hawks seems to have done is taken the subjectivity out of the Tillinghast resonator and created what he refers to as the Hawks device, which creates much the same effect, but in objective reality, rather than it just being an individual who perceives it because of the changes to their pineal gland, that it does actually reshape an area of reality so that it shifts through the dimensions.
1398.56 1417.24 speaker3  That's awesome.
1409.48 1481.36 speaker2  now of how to operate the Hawks device, that, yeah, your initial surmise was correct, that the ring in the floor does seem to be containment of this hole or whatever it is that's being ripped through reality. From some of the later entries, though, as you flick through the whole thing, there are Now, that's another thing. Up to about eight years ago, the entries in this were being written by Aston Hawks. They changed hands, though, and the later entries are all written by someone else. You're not quite sure who. And the indication is that in recent weeks, as they've been going on their fishing expeditions, pulling things through from these higher dimensions, the containment from that ring on the floor is failing.
1476.80 1500.72 speaker3  So maybe like the best idea is kind of what Dr. Nate was saying earlier. And what if we just shove it in real quick and then shut it off? And hopefully nothing breaks containment in that short amount of time. I like it. It seems like a good experiment.
1499.76 1512.32 speaker4  what we're thinking of? Do we feel like we could push this tank?
1508.80 1536.88 speaker2  from the wall, it would probably do most of the falling over work itself. just to see whether you can do this in an orderly manner.
1531.36 1544.76 speaker3  70 luck. I have a 50 mechanical repair.
1542.76 1598.64 speaker2  Rustine is still busy reading the journal. And at first it's fairly rusty. So you're having to put a bit brute force in there. And a few times the spanner slips and things judder in an alarming manner. But you do manage to just keep it under control. The thing is, like I say, it's not very well balanced and it seems to be pulling itself away from the wall at this stage. And if you remove the last few bolts at this stage, it is going to come crashing down.
1596.28 1603.68 speaker3  We're ready to flip the switch. Should I turn it on?
1599.84 1625.28 speaker4  I'm going to go to a workbench and make sure that I have a pair of forceps and a metal canister handy, ready, just in case. Grab the big one first. I think I'm ready. I think I'm ready.
1620.48 1631.68 speaker2  from Dr. Rothstein, just to operate the machinery based on what you've read.
1629.20 1644.16 speaker4  OK. And I got a 22. Nice. It's a hard success.
1639.20 1764.80 speaker2  And you can see that, yeah, perhaps, you know, whoever has been working on the journal since then has perhaps got some of the settings slightly wrong, or at least you hope that you're not compounding the problem as you make a few changes. But then if you're ready to do the deed, are you just pulling down the live switch to activate it once you've got everything set up? starts glowing and almost immediately it's like a heat haze, something rising from the in that ring, there is something else. There is a shifting landscape, maybe. I mean, your eyes and brain are trying to make sense of it and, you know, it sort of makes sense to try to imagine this as a landscape, but that doesn't really work. There are certainly shapes there and things that are moving, all sorts of strange things, some of them small, some of them large. It is perhaps like looking into a fish tank or some kind of display of deep sea creatures. And there are perhaps, you know, some like the creature you've seen before. There are other things that are larger, that look more predatory, that are shifting And there is the uncomfortable feeling that as you're looking at them, they're starting to look at you as well. Let's have sanity rolls up.
1763.16 1792.60 speaker4  31, I fail, 34. Five.
1787.48 1868.00 speaker2  Sort of jumps back from the circle and bumps up against one of the workbenchers, knocking tools off. But he is composing himself. Melon, on the other hand, needs to make an intelligence roll. You are panicking. You've misjudged this whole situation. You need to get out of here as quickly as possible. The problem is that, you know, in your panic, you can't see a way out of here. There was that thing that Rothstein mentioned before about containment failing. And as you're looking around here, you can see that this isn't just contained within this circle. You can see that there's ripples in the air all around, that you're there trapped at the back of the room. How the hell are you going to get out of here without falling into this and getting lost forever? How are you going to get out of this alive?
1859.36 1886.00 speaker5  this this big aquarium over, instead turns and is trying to claw through the stone behind him and falling to the ground, kind of like claws down into the floor, trying to escape like a like a rat trapped in a heated up metal bucket stuck on a snitch's belly.
1885.28 1890.00 speaker2  I can.
1888.32 1924.32 speaker5  32 on a 36. Oh, dear. Oh, well. It's actually a 100.
1919.92 1968.52 speaker2  moment and it creaks and almost comes away from the wall, but doesn't quite. And there's bits of the liquid sloshing down the side, dripping on the ground. There's you saw that there's some kind of metal hatch on the top and there's something you're convinced now that's just slamming against the tank, just slamming against the hatch, trying to force it open from the inside. You know, it knows you're out there. It's it's clearly coming for you.
1966.44 1992.12 speaker5  intensely. Did you guys see what I saw? And then there at the end, it sped you up. So it's coming for you.
1990.92 2008.84 speaker2  Do we notice that? Right. I mean, you can see him. He's down on his hands and knees. He's actually beneath the tank now, just clawing away at the ground.
2004.20 2015.64 speaker4  From my point in the room, can I would I be able to get to one of those bolts, one of the less bolts?
2014.44 2036.80 speaker0  We got to we got to finish this. Now is not the time for this.
2033.56 2050.04 speaker2  Actually, I mean, it probably has occurred to Dr. Rothstein that the metals in this room, none of them seem to be ferrous metals.
2048.76 2063.76 speaker3  Or magnetic. Yeah.
2060.28 2076.24 speaker4  He's loosening. I'm trying to get one of them loosened also.
2070.20 2093.92 speaker2  Are you getting Freddy to safety before you do this or are you just taking your chances and hoping that the tank doesn't crush him?
2090.72 2110.28 speaker4  I'll try to get him out. That's for sure what Nathaniel Coombs would do. He would try to help.
2107.76 2147.40 speaker2  to safety before this thing comes crashing down. OK. And you can see that Dolan's got just about the last bolt out. You can try pushing the roll, but that means that you're not going to get free either if this comes crashing down before you do so. Oh, shit.
2143.40 2154.24 speaker5  Sedgwick was the one who was taking over, but he was he was he's not the closer. He's not the closer. He can't close it. He can't contain it. It's not Kira. It's just not Kira.
2152.76 2175.84 speaker4  I'm going to I'm going to push the roll. I'm going to try it. Nice.
2173.04 2208.76 speaker2  getting him out of the way as you're taking this last bolt out. And you think you're free and clear just to get the last bolt. And then just as you get it clear, Melon pulls Coombs back in the path of all this, just as it comes topping down. to roll clear as this tank comes crashing down.
2208.08 2213.32 speaker4  Nice.
2212.04 2215.92 speaker5  So I'm going to spin five luck.
2215.44 2230.56 speaker4  OK.
2224.32 2281.48 speaker2  shatters, liquid comes pouring out the front and these things come flopping and wriggling out from all over the place. to see whether any of the creatures take an interest in you. rolled out of the way, sees just the tail end of one of these spiny creatures disappearing into his side and wriggling inside him.
2276.48 2330.20 speaker3  Obviously, you know, there's the fellow in the woods and probably a few back on the camp. We're going to have to do this whole process at least one more time so we can get that one out of you. And he remembers the conversations that he had had with with Hawk about stuff like this. And he's just amazed that it's right there in front of him.
2322.28 2349.52 speaker2  You do notice that you can't actually see the ring in the ground anymore and that every now and then out of the corner of your eye, you can see just shifts in the air around you as if it's not all just happening within the center of the room.
2344.80 2363.36 speaker3  book, looking for any notes about how to change it or anything.
2353.88 2402.56 speaker2  writing these notes has changed his mind so often that it's proving not very useful. grasp how all this works. roll, who's busy throwing these things in, just to see how long it takes you to wrangle all these creatures and throw them into the center.
2401.72 2405.44 speaker3  I've got a 50.
2403.96 2410.24 speaker4  Would I be able to take part in this?
2409.96 2417.80 speaker2  Yeah. So, yeah, let's have Dr. Coons do it.
2415.60 2425.44 speaker4  I pass a 58 on a 70.
2417.80 2462.12 speaker2  OK, that's good, because what you notice as you're throwing the creatures in is that the other creatures you can see within the zone or whatever it is that's being created. really hear them and they don't necessarily behave in the same way. But you're seeing what you consider to be perhaps some kind of flock behavior or certainly the kind of behavior you might see in birds or fish or whatever that are beginning to look agitated and moving in formation away from maybe some approaching predator.
2461.00 2472.16 speaker4  Oh, shit. What's Inside Out Monkey doing? Did he get into the portal already?
2469.52 2494.28 speaker2  It's bigger. environment. You're kicking it into the center. Right. Then...
2493.08 2511.72 speaker5  You love to see it.
2505.16 2546.28 speaker2  think is probably a scream of pain, or at least that's what you get for the first couple of seconds of it. But the sound, it does something to your brain as you hear it, and you can just hear or feel your brain just shutting down in response to this sensory overload that's coming out of this pained creature.
2543.24 2564.44 speaker3  I failed 79 on a 40.
2557.04 2630.36 speaker2  and you can see that your two companions have just dropped the ground and are just sitting or lying there looking vacantly as this thing sings or screams or whatever. finish the job of kicking it in or shoving it in through the barrier. air, it's a bit big for that, but you managed to shove it and as it disappears into the the center of the room, then the sound stops. I'll kick them.
2628.64 2652.80 speaker4  going to be the one that we need to turn it off. So I'm rushing over to him and maybe like shaking him by the shoulders. Carl, Carl, you with us? We're going to need you to turn off this machine here pretty soon.
2650.24 2684.00 speaker5  earlier and then put it into Rothstein. They suck it out of your body. We got to get the one that went in when you screamed earlier. We got to get it out of here. We got to put it in Rothstein. That way his eyes come back from the glassiness, OK? Just long enough for him to turn off the machine, right?
2683.48 2707.16 speaker4  Enjoy. All right, all right. And I hold my arms up, giving him ample angle.
2699.40 2747.76 speaker2  Coombes, sticking your forceps in through his side and just digging around until you grab hold of something that you maybe hope isn't his pancreas and start pulling.
2747.16 2755.20 speaker4  Does that matter? Or it just goes to zero? You die instantly.
2752.08 2764.24 speaker2  So your group luck roll now is zero. Just putting that out there. Perfect.
2762.84 2777.72 speaker4  That's all that was. You're a good friend, Joe.
2773.76 2791.16 speaker2  Coombes as you drag this screaming, thrashing creature out of him.
2790.08 2811.56 speaker3  He's about to crumble.
2809.44 2829.56 speaker5  I'm going to hold onto it in the forceps.
2824.12 2835.16 speaker2  its way into his body, his flesh isn't in that state where you can get the forceps in, at least not without cutting him open and gouging him.
2833.76 2869.24 speaker5  I'm going to try it first. I'm going to try it first where the forceps keep just like... Poking him really hard. going right into his belly.
2867.16 2882.76 speaker2  creature wriggles its way inside him. And yeah, I suppose with that, with that jolt of energy, you do start to come out of your fugue state.
2880.36 2901.32 speaker5  I like to think the entire time this is happening.
2898.68 2963.08 speaker2  with the containment while Dr. Rothstein's been unconscious. But then you remember it would be pointless. Rothstein is coming out of this fugue state, he can see, yeah, that this, this area of otherness is spreading and has, you know, is now pushing up against where you are and it looks like it's almost about to engulf your feet where you're lying on the ground. You can also see now that all the smaller creatures have fled and there is the shadow or the outline of something very large coming your way.
2961.92 2967.96 speaker3  Oh, so, yeah.
2966.96 2971.44 speaker4  He's already gone.
2971.12 2992.80 speaker3  I do.
2983.32 3016.52 speaker2  huge that is just beginning to move into the center of the room and just pushing beyond the bounds of the containment here. And there's something that is reaching out towards you. And then just all of a sudden, the knife switch goes click. And there's just the metal ring in the center of the room, the stone floor. Whoa.
3015.12 3025.96 speaker3  Did it, did it work? Are we all here? Dolan is still dazed, right?
3023.12 3041.16 speaker2  You've got no memory of what's just happened. Yeah. I mean, one moment, you know, the tank was going over and the next moment you're now sitting here and everyone's in different positions and you're not really sure what happened.
3038.56 3043.88 speaker5  Uh, park the car.
3042.88 3047.48 speaker3  Uh, park the car.
3046.56 3066.76 speaker5  It's facing out. That way we can get out quickly. Are they gone? Uh, did we, did we do it? But how do you like them apples?
3066.48 3073.76 speaker3  Yeah.
3068.44 3093.20 speaker5  And also I'm sure there's a lot of squeamy things out there in the woods that seem to still be out there. There's that guy that's fucked up. I can't, not on this, not on this one. around here.
3092.92 3100.36 speaker4  Right.
3096.40 3110.64 speaker3  Nancy and, uh, yeah, the other one. And then the, you know, that guy in the woods just seemed to be silly with them. So, uh, we might just have to throw him all the way in there. Didn't we buoyant some though?
3110.48 3112.44 speaker4  Yeah.
3110.64 3118.52 speaker3  We could just burn that fellow alive.
3117.80 3144.04 speaker5  the end there. has no idea how to describe what was reaching out there at the end, right before it came down.
3139.88 3163.64 speaker3  shadow moving towards you through the thing, you know, presumably it would just move on. Like if we did it in 15 minutes, I don't, you know, 20, you know, an hour is still going to be waiting around for that portal. It saw no, it's going to be eating fishes somewhere else.
3160.04 3168.72 speaker4  we're just going to burn the remaining ones, should we, should we destroy this machine?
3167.56 3185.52 speaker3  No, we keep the machine. In what way, Doc? Uh, I won't, it will be safe.
3183.96 3193.60 speaker4  I mean, we've seen what it can do. That's, that's, there's no way that that can be used for good, right?
3191.36 3201.52 speaker3  I'm just saying, are we done destroying things with it? We should probably at least look at the lights in the house, right? Well, we got to go check out the lights in the house.
3200.24 3206.92 speaker4  We've got to find Billy and Esther. Yeah.
3205.28 3220.32 speaker3  How did you make me feel so good? Oh, fantastic.
3219.28 3234.12 speaker5  Well, great. No, I'm just kidding. Lay down. look, do not look down.
3233.52 3242.56 speaker3  Okay. Don't press.
3240.48 3243.68 speaker5  Press my finger right above my belly then.
3243.04 3250.96 speaker4  Okay.
3248.64 3264.32 speaker2  There's no ripping or tearing at the flesh. It's just like putting your fingers into a bowl of warm oatmeal.
3264.08 3269.72 speaker4  Yeah.
3268.36 3272.72 speaker2  inside of your own abdomen.
3271.40 3306.76 speaker3  I got a 69. A fail. Did you say 69? Yeah. Usually I'm happy to see that number, but.
3305.16 3318.40 speaker5  critical success house rule.
3316.88 3365.64 speaker4  When in Rome, 69.
3362.88 3370.84 speaker5  Just trying to get 30 minutes of silence to really get the
3370.32 3385.76 speaker3  Shut up. Sorry. Okay.
3382.56 3396.84 speaker5  Uh, cause it'll way over compress. If it's trying to cut out the fans that are no longer there. You guys can talk about it. Yeah, but you can't.
3396.64 3408.12 speaker3  Yeah.
3405.00 3422.00 speaker5  Is there a point in the rest of us speaking to each other? Can't think of any.
3421.44 3423.72 speaker3  I can swim.
3423.16 3425.52 speaker4  I can swim.
3423.72 3481.84 speaker3  I've put on a lot of weight lately though. was a tic talk the other day that I saw. But it's just this guy. Considering your, your internet culture consumption, that could have been like a billion times worse. He's like, dude, you just look like you like have never bowled a strike. He's like, dude, I have my own ball. Like just getting really mad. And I'm like, that is a hilarious insult.
3479.76 3498.32 speaker5  He was trying to remember if he'd ever.
3494.64 3515.48 speaker4  Ben to give you a tip and he's told you about the bringing the hand up and touching the ear and the very next ball you rolled was a strike and we all were like, Ben knows how to bowl and knows how to teach people how to bowl that. Wow.
3514.20 3521.28 speaker3  So he's probably not a good one.
3520.04 3525.04 speaker2  otherwise that's going to smart, right? Correct.
3522.72 3542.88 speaker4  That, that would hurt quite a bit.
3536.08 3570.36 speaker5  boot on my ankle because I had like fractured a bone in my foot, but my family still decided that our outing that Saturday was going to be bowling. No, exactly. You can, you can do it. I bet. And I was like, yeah, okay. So I like would waddle up and I bowled seven strikes in a row to start off the game. Hell yeah. I don't remember it all exactly, but I do remember I left a couple open frames there upsetting.
3567.12 3571.00 speaker2  So the secret to good bowling is to be smacked off your tits.
3570.76 3578.80 speaker3  Yep.
3578.60 3581.64 speaker4  Yeah.
3578.80 3588.68 speaker3  My highest I ever bowled was a two Oh two. I had to go to Instagram to look cause I was so proud of myself. That's good.
3587.84 3600.72 speaker4  That is good. Yeah, that's really good.
3595.96 3601.72 speaker5  So I've never bowled in between 160 and two 47.
3601.00 3642.28 speaker3  That's crazy. When I worked at the order, I picked up some, some tips from Jake that made me a much better bowler and it made it really fun. It's fun to be good at something fun to play it when you're good at it. But he taught me how to do the like spinny curve throw game changer. Plus it's way more fun to do it that way. That's a good strategy. And that's what I've always said.
3639.80 3651.52 speaker5  Um, we went to the house.
3648.88 3658.40 speaker3  The home who must be named the name of the scenario. I yep.
3657.88 3663.40 speaker4  Good.
3662.24 3721.96 speaker3  that there was a name for it. We went to prospect thing. We passed. we, uh, the slugs escaped, right? Kinda kind of. Yeah. Are they called Hoover towns? Cause they suck. I love vacuum humor. And then we went to the house. We did some sort of portal, uh, broke a fish tank. There's a monkey.
3717.72 3736.20 speaker5  especially because this will be in the same episode as what just happened. Incredible.
3734.04 3748.72 speaker2  wanted to do in the laboratory. And that your plan now was to go to the main house and see whether you could find out what had happened to the kids.
3743.88 3761.72 speaker4  I remember, if nothing else, that the kids were our next plan of attack.
3757.24 3836.28 speaker2  There is, however, some light because when you switched the generators on, you switched on some lights within Prospect itself. There isn't a lot of light coming out. It's not like every light in the place is now blazing. But there are a few. equidistant from both the front and the back entrances. You don't see any movement, but the window, yeah, the window looks a bit weird from down here. It looks like it's got perhaps some strangely colored curtains across it, some very moist looking curtains.
3834.64 3867.80 speaker5  on it, or is it more thick and heavy? Like he's an older gentleman. Let's say he's got that like turkey neck thing going on. So he just kind of grabs it as gobbler and he's like, oh, is it more like, and he just starts kind of shaking around the like part by his Adam's apple, just kind of violently making a kind of a wet slapping noise of the skin against his Adam's apple. Uh, skin draperies?
3867.16 3882.28 speaker2  Oh, good.
3880.88 3890.40 speaker4  I don't know why you would have floated that. That's kind of an out there thing to kind of jump to the conclusion.
3888.92 3899.36 speaker5  For some reason, I can't remember.
3898.32 3911.12 speaker4  Let me let me take a look at you. Did you get hit? Are you all right?
3907.68 3937.96 speaker3  Yes, I wonder if I'll have the same accent.
3932.52 3946.00 speaker5  Because they might expect us in the back, because if we're supposed to be sneaky, then we would go in the back. Right. And they clearly know something's up because we turned on the power. What's it about?
3945.44 3969.32 speaker3  I was doing you. Yeah, a window. Why don't we look for a window down here? Thank you.
3959.24 3975.76 speaker2  Coons can attempt to spot hidden role, actually, because unlike the others, you have a bit of medical knowledge that you can draw upon here that might help. I will give it a shot.
3975.00 3990.08 speaker4  I don't pass. It's a 27 on a 25. You could spend two points of luck. I ain't got no luck, boys. That was one of the things that happened last session.
3989.32 3992.68 speaker5  Does that mean our...
3990.96 4006.80 speaker3  ...group luck roles are now at zero?
4006.28 4007.64 speaker4  You can't.
4006.80 4022.64 speaker3  With some of my luck, or...?
4009.20 4040.64 speaker2  But what I will say is that, and it's difficult to tell what you're looking at through that window upstairs, because there's condensation on the inside of the window, and there's definitely something obfuscating the view. But, yeah, there's something about the color and the texture of what you're looking at in the window that is just tickling the back of your brain. But you just can't get a good enough view to really work out what it is.
4037.04 4050.72 speaker4  There's something up with what's going on in that window up there. I don't think it's skin, but there's something odd about it. It's tickling the back of my brain.
4049.56 4064.96 speaker3  Look at the color of it. I prefer not to. I don't want to look at this thing at all.
4064.56 4076.72 speaker5  Yeah. Exactly, exactly.
4076.20 4078.52 speaker3  Thanks, Luke.
4077.12 4109.36 speaker2  There certainly are. The windows are shuttered, but it wouldn't take much to pry the shutters away.
4106.52 4152.00 speaker3  Explore, save the kids, get out. We are the storm. We made a portal already today, so we can do anything. Let's let's get in there. Let's save these fucking kids. Let's find a goddamn window we can open.
4146.20 4211.96 speaker2  There's a bit of creaking and grunting as you pull these rusted shutters away. And there is some light on inside. You can see that you're looking into a room. Yeah, I mean, it's obviously a room, but the walls are covered with wallpaper or paint of some description that is glistening, that it's sort of reddish purple and there's liquid trickling down it.
4204.76 4216.80 speaker5  That way, they, you know, if they hear you coming in through the first place, then they wouldn't be able to.
4216.12 4225.48 speaker4  You're really?
4222.96 4262.16 speaker3  Let me let me help you up into the window. And I like offer him my hands to step into.
4254.68 4320.40 speaker2  But when you try pushing the sash window up, there's resistance. And as you do so, there's a sort of noise and there's something sort of wet and rubbery around the bottom of it that just pulls the window back down as you pull it up. And there's a smell to it, maybe not an entirely repellent smell, but yeah, there's certainly some nasty undertones to it, but mostly it's is kind of warm and moist and meaty.
4316.64 4327.48 speaker4  If we had if we had a knife or something, could we could we could we cut it away?
4325.92 4352.04 speaker2  Does does anybody have a knife?
4349.12 4364.16 speaker5  But I figure I could chew it away, probably. Guys, two things.
4360.48 4391.44 speaker3  But then to Freddie, I love your enthusiasm. Maybe go back to your original plan of the hands, not just eating the bubble gum, because I don't think that's bubble gum. But also, why don't you use my knife?
4380.68 4396.72 speaker5  And as he slowly opens it up, he'll slide the blade just in between the window and the threshold and just kind of like, slide it along.
4395.92 4402.88 speaker2  Ah, yes.
4401.76 4429.92 speaker4  I thought you were too.
4419.04 4438.28 speaker2  And inside the house, you can hear what sounds like a creaking, groaning sound coming from deep within. And just for a moment, the wall shakes and trembles.
4437.64 4453.96 speaker3  I'm in.
4445.44 4529.32 speaker2  What I do want is not a CLIMB roll, but just the DEX roll, I think, just to see how gracefully you can do this. Because what you realize as you're clambering through is everything inside is slippery as fuck. Nice. but are now again covered with this pulsating pinkish purple stuff. I mean, despite that, you've managed to land on your feet and not slip over the floor. The floor is also covered with all of this, plus a few inches of fluid. Yeah, it is incredibly slippery. Now that you're inside and get a good look at all this.
4522.60 4582.52 speaker5  It's just a very wet, very squelchy, very slippery room. Completely normal. I rolled a sixty seven on a fifty, so that's a fail. he's going to try to slide across the room as quietly as possible to hear better, because if he's further away from the three men and the outside, he might be able to hear better. He pushes himself along the room.
4580.08 4678.08 speaker2  Yeah, you can push the roll here. membranous whatever it is. But there's a bit where you suddenly realize as you reach it that the wood underneath or the flooring underneath has rotted away. And you work this out just as your foot goes straight through it with this sort of wet ripping sound. And the next thing you know, you're up to your waist in the floor and desperately scrabbling, holding on, trying to hold on to this as this wet, slippery surface as you are falling or slipping through this hole in the floor. From down below you, you can smell this indescribable stench. There are acid acrid vapors coming up, burning your eyes and this overpowering smell like the worst septic tank you've ever smelt down below.
4677.16 4687.48 speaker4  I've got to get in there. Give me a boost. Give me a boost. You're a doctor, too. Not that kind of doctor.
4685.96 4701.04 speaker2  Coombes in through the window. Again, you know, if you're going to try to avoid just sliding around helplessly, I do want to DEX roll. Sure.
4700.60 4755.52 speaker4  Push it. But I want, yeah. When I get up, I get a hand on something firm and my hand just slips right off. And I'm kind of, I'm kind of wiggling, rolling through. And I'm going to try and restabilize myself by grabbing hold of the window frame and getting a better purchase on everything there. And then I pass. Oh, good.
4748.44 4788.44 speaker2  And certainly your fingers go through a couple of things that you hope are wooden struts and not, say, ribs. But, yeah, holding on to it, you managed to get yourself onto your feet. You can see Freddy just about five feet away from you, just slowly slipping down this hole, his fingernails digging into this wet tissue, ripping holes in it. But it's just so slippery. He's just falling down in slow motion, inch by inch.
4785.44 4829.88 speaker4  It might be the frame of the window, if it's all.
4826.36 4868.08 speaker2  Coombes' ankle, because otherwise shit is going to get real. And there's this horrible, wet squelching sound as you're pulling yourself out of this hole and more of this hideous, hideous stench coming up.
4866.44 4890.52 speaker3  Carl, help me, help me pull them out. We got to go deeper.
4884.40 4895.04 speaker2  He is absolutely covered in just slime and bits of tissue and...
4893.40 4912.80 speaker3  Or me in seventh grade.
4910.12 4917.00 speaker4  So that's a that's the that's a good pass.
4916.60 4958.64 speaker2  Yes. Yeah, you can see there is something very much about this that reminds you of the lining of the large intestine.
4957.28 4965.40 speaker4  Then maybe keep it to yourself.
4964.60 4972.60 speaker3  We got to know.
4970.72 4980.92 speaker4  It's it's it's intestine. It might have been trying to digest you in some way.
4978.04 5087.48 speaker3  It's a goddamn monster house written by Dan Harmon. This is this is a lot bigger than we thought, boys. Is there like a groundskeeping garage or home or anything? Boys, here's what I think we got to do before we get back into the house is we got to put some hobnails on our boots. So I literally just want to find nails to run through our shoes. Good point, Freddy. OK, OK, thank you. It's important to be clear when delineating a task. So, yeah, you want to take your shoes off. Step one, step two, you drive the nails through the bottom of the shoes. Step three, you got sticky shoes. So it does not want to eat us. So I don't think we want to be vomited out forcibly by this by this house. We know it just tried to eat you. You heard it groaning and creaking as it happened. Come on.
5086.96 5116.52 speaker5  Is that right?
5110.72 5139.72 speaker2  outside of the house a bit, you can find there are a couple of other outbuildings just around the back. In fact, really just around the corner from where you are now that have got all sorts of tools, a tool shed and a workshop that's obviously used for some maintenance. Rope? Rope. Hmm. I think this would be a good opportunity for a group luck roll.
5139.08 5141.64 speaker6  Well, we can't.
5141.24 5147.88 speaker3  Roll it. Roll your luck, Joe. You got it.
5145.04 5164.12 speaker4  It's a, uh, oh, it's a eighty eight.
5160.28 5170.56 speaker2  Do you think that it wouldn't stand any chance of supporting one of your weights?
5168.16 5179.92 speaker6  Yeah, I see it, too.
5176.88 5208.52 speaker2  But we'll save the luck roll on that one for when you're actually in trouble.
5207.76 5218.04 speaker4  I think it'd be handy.
5216.48 5245.88 speaker2  I won't make you make a luck roll for that. It's a workshop, there'll be screwdrivers. out by the generator. That's right. I actually, I mean, Dr. before.
5243.84 5262.24 speaker3  So I don't even mention it to the rest of the group. A cup a day keeps the doctor away. That's a joke because leaded tastes sweet and there wasn't unleaded gasoline yet. So, oh dude, that was fucking weird.
5261.48 5265.16 speaker5  Yes, it was.
5264.08 5278.00 speaker3  I just saw you guys like,
5274.96 5288.00 speaker2  your boots, what are you doing next?
5283.92 5301.24 speaker4  there any place in that house that wasn't fleshy? Was there any hardwoods anywhere? You saw what I saw.
5297.08 5350.52 speaker2  through the floor, there were at least three other doors or at least three doors rather in that room. There was one that was ajar. In fact, no, two of them were ajar, but two internal doors. One of them seemed to go deeper within the house, possibly into a corridor. And yeah, that looked almost as fleshy.
5346.68 5356.40 speaker3  Uh, what order are we in and in our hose train?
5355.88 5365.80 speaker6  Okay.
5365.52 5367.56 speaker5  Exactly.
5365.80 5381.96 speaker3  I, uh, no objections.
5380.20 5455.32 speaker2  You're, you're not going around the front. You do have to get the knife out and cut some of these strands of flesh away from the door frame, but the door itself isn't locked. And, you know, once again with a sort of squelching noise, you managed to pull it open and yeah, inside you can see what do you now reckon must be the kitchen? I mean, it's difficult to tell because, you know, every identifying bit of furniture or surface or whatever is covered in flesh. There's a sort of side door that looks like it may go to some steps down and then there's another door that's going deeper into the house. Coombs earlier. Now that the rest of you are there on the doorstep within the house, dealing with, you know, everything, the sensory overload that this is providing. I do want San rolls off the rest of you, everyone except for Freddy.
5452.60 5459.92 speaker4  I failed a 40 on a 28.
5458.56 5497.00 speaker2  So is it just Dr. Coombs who loses a D3 of San? of you are stepping in, Dr. Coombs is just there hesitating on the doorstep with the frayed hose suddenly getting pulled taut and creaking a bit. You can see some of the cracks and getting that bit longer as he's just standing there digging the nails of his shoes into this flesh.
5492.72 5503.84 speaker4  I told you guys that I think this might be a digestive tract and you guys just want to walk in.
5501.80 5514.76 speaker3  This would be the upper part of the body. I mean, essentially all the body just exists to support digestion. So, you know, we're basically just a tube from our mouth to our asshole, but.
5513.56 5532.32 speaker4  That's what they taught us, correct? Day one in medical school.
5529.32 5567.96 speaker3  property, but we got the nails in our shoes now. We can maybe, unfortunately, I think we're going to have to go up to that fucking creepy moist curtain and check out the light in that room. But it seems like we have the tools to do that now without getting sucked in by the floor. We got the hose. We're all holding hands. They're just like kernels of corn. We just go straight through, uh, unbothered.
5564.72 5580.16 speaker5  I live my life by three rules and three rules only.
5578.12 5614.24 speaker3  And you got, it's just time to live, Dr. Coombs. I love you.
5609.40 5638.44 speaker2  So you're going through into, yeah, this little corridor that's got a door on the other side, uh, and then seems to go round to your left.
5636.36 5653.52 speaker3  To the magic school bus inside the human body.
5648.96 5690.72 speaker2  getting less flashy around here, but the carpet is still very, very moist here. There's still a kind of constant, as you're walking across it and you come across and you can see, you know, in the few lights that are coming around that to your left is probably the ruins of an old conservatory round to the right is the sort of main entrance with staircases up the ruins, the front door and doorways to a couple of other interior rooms.
5689.04 5702.60 speaker4  taking our surroundings one more time around here. So if there's anything that's changed, another word for deeper in.
5699.40 5712.08 speaker2  hidden role, they'll tell you different things.
5711.56 5720.04 speaker3  Failed.
5719.68 5728.76 speaker5  Okay.
5727.96 5748.96 speaker2  the house. Uh, for a moment you thought it was like a breeze coming in through the front door, but it's not that, that the movement of the air seems to change direction on a slow, regular basis.
5748.44 5762.20 speaker3  Hmm.
5759.68 5796.84 speaker2  yeah, it's like what you heard earlier. There is a sound coming from upstairs, a sort of rasping, groaning sound. I mean, it's difficult to discern because it's so low. Uh, it's almost infrasound. It's rumbling through the house. But you, you reckon it is originating upstairs. I mean, I think we got to go upstairs to that flush curtain room.
5793.84 5799.44 speaker5  kill the sleeping occupant, you got to go up to the bedroom and kill the sleeping occupant.
5798.48 5811.04 speaker3  That's what tonight is tonight.
5807.72 5818.76 speaker4  Is that, is that the, I thought this is, we're standing on there. Okay, gotcha.
5818.40 5853.88 speaker3  Yeah. Ah, I've not heard that one. You're not from around here. Don't worry about it. Yes, I agree.
5853.72 5878.60 speaker6  Yeah.
5873.20 5900.84 speaker2  I mean, there's, you've got short corridors going off on other side, but you're fairly certain, you know, off the back of the rolls you made earlier, that the main movement of the air is coming through the double doors of what you assume is the master bedroom directly in front of you.
5896.16 5938.96 speaker5  pushing in and out through these double doors, which is likely the master bedroom. This is my whisper. So we're all keeping our voices down. So I say we push in double doors wide open. What would Neil put do is what I'm trying to say. Die. He was sleeping. All right. So we'll let's, um, let's rush in there.
5937.80 6018.12 speaker2  You rush in. There is a single flickering light in the ceiling here. Obviously the moisture has got into the works and it's just flickering on and off. But you can make out that there, again, the walls here are disturbingly fleshy. It's not the same color. It doesn't look like the same kind of tissue as you saw downstairs. It's, it's something different. It's pulsating. pulsating hole in the wall, this large hole, and you can see something worm-like moving around inside it. Huge. I mean, like larger than any one of you. entirely, but yeah, now that your mind has made the connection with the tongue, that is absolutely a tongue.
6017.08 6033.52 speaker3  Mouth to asshole. That's all we are. That's all this monster house is.
6026.96 6057.44 speaker2  particularly here at that point, you can hear this rumbling sound coming out of the hole.
6054.88 6063.24 speaker3  Are you acquainted with this goddamn monster house?
6062.84 6072.92 speaker2  Okay. So each one of you loses a D6 of sand.
6071.28 6081.64 speaker4  I rolled a big old sixers.
6080.92 6084.84 speaker5  Oh, you passed. So, so, so you still lose one.
6084.52 6093.44 speaker2  Okay. For the two of you who lost six. Can I have intelligence rolls please?
6091.56 6100.20 speaker4  Also a 65 on a 60. Dr.
6099.68 6164.88 speaker2  That's good. You're not having a bad and madness. Dr. Rothstein on the other hand is, I think, you know, that makes sense. Total sense. I heard your name. I think at that point, Dr. Rothstein in blind panic runs, just runs out of the room. Suddenly that rope that you've got is, well, rather the hose is stretched taut. And well, we've already established you're not going to pass a group luck roll here. So that's the point at which it just snaps. This frayed rubber just, just snaps completely. as he runs off somewhere within the house. You don't see where he's gone.
6163.20 6172.24 speaker3  monster house that wants to eat us.
6171.96 6173.92 speaker6  Yeah.
6173.20 6181.20 speaker5  Cause I don't know.
6178.92 6198.68 speaker3  I don't want to give Luke or the DM any ideas. We got to get them boys.
6195.60 6222.96 speaker4  the wall tongue mouth has just spoken. And he's going to kind of look wide-eyed at it and say, you, you can, you can, you can talk, you can talk.
6217.60 6240.80 speaker2  air suddenly quite fast through the room around you enough to ruffle your hair.
6240.48 6249.36 speaker4  We got it. We got to get Carl back in here. He, he could help.
6247.24 6268.24 speaker5  you know, whole house. Like Sedgwick turned Hawks into a fucking house. So let's, uh, keep talking to them, I guess. And let's get some answers.
6266.24 6272.96 speaker4  That's are you, are you Austin?
6271.68 6274.12 speaker5  about how we can help you.
6273.84 6277.72 speaker4  Yep.
6276.20 6279.16 speaker3  But you're talking so slow.
6278.80 6292.04 speaker5  Maybe.
6291.80 6303.68 speaker4  All right. We'll get them. Hang on. Hang on. Carl.
6302.64 6308.04 speaker2  Rothstein please?
6306.96 6325.60 speaker3  So I fail.
6317.92 6383.16 speaker2  you had run back out through the way you came back in, but in your panic, you have clearly forgotten about that hole in the floor. Yeah. As, as your foot just goes down through this hole and you're off balance, you've gone down, you slammed your face down into this pulsating, warm flesh at the floor. And again, you're in a very similar situation that Freddie was earlier of just beginning to slip down this hole. this dripping liquid and the sound of liquid moving around and you can give me a listen roll as well, just to see whether you can pick up something else.
6381.80 6388.36 speaker3  33 on a 20.
6386.48 6392.96 speaker2  Like I say, liquid moving around.
6391.72 6412.08 speaker3  I'm not going to spend my luck yet.
6408.68 6424.36 speaker2  I mean, yeah, maybe if you just let yourself slide down a bit further, you could push the roll and get a better listen. Yep.
6423.44 6428.64 speaker3  Oh, okay.
6427.88 6443.16 speaker5  I love you. This makes me so happy.
6437.24 6484.64 speaker2  underneath and yeah, you do actually at that point hear what it is that you were struggling to, which is just the sound of someone crying. It sounds like a little girl crying somewhere inside, somewhere down below. And, and yeah, I mean, as you strain your head down just to get a better, a better lock on where she is, that's the point at which just the remaining bit of the floor holding you up collapses and you fall down into darkness.
6481.40 6507.84 speaker5  what was down there, but I really didn't want Frederick Millen the first to fall down there and I really got the best of both worlds out of this.
6504.44 6534.12 speaker3  there or what's waiting on the other side, but it's the climb.
6532.68 6543.12 speaker5  Her godmother's Dolly Parton. Okay.
6540.24 6543.12 speaker3  I was like, are we just saying things associated with musicians? How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the
