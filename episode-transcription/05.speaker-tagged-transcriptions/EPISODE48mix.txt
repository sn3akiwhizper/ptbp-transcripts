0.00 182.72 speaker0  What's up my babies, it's your grease daddy Wolf the Dog, and I'm here absorbing all the oil from all the deep fryers here in contention. The grease used here in the past is much better than the grease used in the present and the future.

How else am I going to fatten them up before I feast upon them? The news is meant to be a time to remind our listeners of the past. So you might not have to send your minds on such a difficult journey when remembering all the nonsense that has gone on so far. Now, if I pick and pull what I remember from my time in current day contention, it might spoil some of the sweet niblets that are being served up in this story. This fresh, fresh story. We may be in the past, but I've seen the future and I know the best possible present is Moondance by Blue False Indigo.
174.42 220.56 speaker1  The sun, the sun, the sun is leaving soon. She knows, she knows, she knows that the time has come to dance beneath the, dance beneath the shadow of the moon.
219.56 238.56 speaker2  Is it DS and NCS? Holy shit. Yeah, I'm super, super stoked. My dad is turning 60 on that day and so my brother and I are taking him to that game
237.56 239.56 speaker1  Lucky.
238.56 292.74 speaker2  Yeah, it's going to be dope. That's super dope. Somebody I know was doing one of the Atlanta games. I've only been once and it was when I was like 17, 18 years old and I was there with candlelight thing, my brother and I skipped out on it to get extremely drunk at the hotel. Like you do. We, uh, there was a college basketball game on and we bought a really cheap bottle of bourbon and we played a game where we each chose a team and then every time the team
291.74 301.30 speaker0  Yeah. What?
294.74 344.46 speaker2  He was 21 and we were children in monsters and we got so drunk. Oh yeah. Yeah. Rip. Um, we're taking his corpse to game four. Pretty cool. My ghost brother to buy us tickets. Uh, so we, we get really drunk and then we change into our swimming trunks. Uh, yeah. We even made a thing where it was like, and on turnovers and dunks you take two shots cause we're idiots and thankfully I don't drink like that anymore, but we're very drunk in our swimsuits in downtown Atlanta and the pool was closed. So we went to the weight room and maxed out on bench.
342.46 345.46 speaker0  This is standard stuff.
344.46 391.34 speaker2  Yeah. And then we went outside for me to go smoke a cigarette right after doing that because like, Hey, Hey, you guys have any money? And we were like, no, no, not at all. But uh, and like we pull out this bourbon from our bag, we brought it with us outside and we're like, you want to get drunk with us? His name was Orestes. Orestes. Yeah, he's, he's, he was so funny. And then we, uh, we talked with him for a long time before we decided we'd walk around downtown, but we walked directly into the candlelight vigil that was happening from.
388.34 403.46 speaker0  The thing we were supposed to be at. That's great.
398.94 454.10 speaker2  and hoping desperately not to run into our dad who's hopefully not listening to this podcast. How do you spell Krinklehoff, Joe? Oh boy. Cool. That works for me. Yeah. The professor's name is, he, he spells it a little different. P H. Sure. You are heading to the woods in your mom's minivan.
452.62 473.22 speaker1  That's, that's all it is. That's all it's ever been. driving me. That's all I'm saying.
471.26 476.02 speaker2  Mom, Ash has a car.
474.34 493.34 speaker1  It'd be easier for all of us.
489.90 499.90 speaker2  just causing all sorts of wreck and havoc all over the place. I mean, it's just, it's just not who you're going to be. All right.
498.90 512.94 speaker1  You're right.
507.18 554.70 speaker2  She reluctantly turns onto the little gravel road that says, has got a sign next to it that says the contention woods. It's trying to sprint. It seems like its leg might be broken and it tries to cross the road in front of you. And her reaction time is Nada. She doesn't even see it. And she just crushes.
553.70 560.06 speaker1  That's cold shit.
557.98 592.94 speaker2  I don't like you using that word. And you guys pull into the parking lot, it's a gravel parking lot, and there are a few cars there. You do see two cars that one of which has a boot on it and the other has a piece of paper taped up to the driver's side window. You also see the 91 Firebird that Ash drives and then near the little shack, the little Rangers shack right at the trailhead entrance. Right next to that is an old Ford Bronco with a lift kit on it.
591.94 594.94 speaker1  Sure.
593.94 611.70 speaker2  No, it's unmarked. Gotcha. But the plates are state level. Gotcha. Immediately your mom is like, well, at least, you know, there's some sort of authority presence here. They'll be watching over y'all.
605.20 615.62 speaker1  Are you scared of stuff that could happen to me or are you scared of me doing stuff? Both. You don't have to worry, mom.
613.70 653.26 speaker2  Didn't you read that op-ed in the newspaper? The Contention Chronicle says that we've got multiple people that are out here in the woods they're missing. You know? So I just don't, I know that, you know, Officer Cox is working hard trying to keep everything in line. I trust our town's authority figures, just as everyone should, can. You should trust your authority figures, currently me, but I do trust you. It's just, I don't trust the influence that these boys are having on you.
649.74 659.86 speaker1  There's no way that anything's going to happen tonight that you wouldn't be proud of.
658.86 680.42 speaker2  is. I mean, he is the number one used car salesman in contention. He tells me all the time, I know. If he wouldn't have snapped his knee, you know, he would have gone pro, but that's what we're hoping for you, not the snap knee part, the going pro part, all right? I know, I know.
679.42 697.98 speaker1  I did bring marshmallows. Thanks, mom. I love you. boy. I go around the back of the car and I pull out those marshmallows. Can I pull out a tent?
696.98 699.42 speaker2  Yeah.
698.42 702.42 speaker0  I got my tent and a sleeping bag.
701.42 709.10 speaker1  I've done this a few years in a row now.
704.42 720.90 speaker2  So you get everything about the car and she's like, I'm going to park right here and I'm not going to leave until I see you go up in there, all right?
717.50 730.30 speaker1  I'm going to take whatever route I need to take that I can walk past that car that had a note on its window. I just want to read what that note says as I go.
725.22 737.66 speaker2  So it's just a notice that says if this car is still here on a certain date, like maybe a week or two from now, that it'll get booted.
733.90 750.66 speaker1  So I walk down the trailhead and every little while I check back and see if she's still there and every time she is, I wave again, kind of exasperatedly each time.
748.72 753.98 speaker2  come from inside of it.
752.98 758.06 speaker1  Hey. Oh, hey. Turtle me.
757.06 775.10 speaker2  All right. I know Jeb's not here, but my name is Woodrow. It says right here, and he points to his badge, and he's like, but you can call me Buzz, as that is my nickname. Hey. Hey, Buzz.
772.86 785.70 speaker1  I'm doing quite well.
780.86 794.42 speaker2  So if you wouldn't mind, step right up, and he grabs this Polaroid camera off the desk in front of him, and he holds it up to you, and he snaps a picture. Oh, hey. Oh, hey there. Okay. Fine.
793.42 800.38 speaker1  I'm Ken. I'm Ken Krinklehoff. Oh.
797.42 844.46 speaker2  Yeah, and he goes out and he grabs it, and he is like extremely frail. You see that he actually has a cane at his side, and his hands are like shaking as he And he kind of points back at this board, this bulletin board behind him, and you see that have been taken in this exact spot with a piece of paper behind them. And when he asked you your name, he wrote down Ken Krinklehoff on this sheet that looks similar to those. And he's like, I got a couple more questions for you. What are you up to tonight in these here woods?
842.94 870.62 speaker1  We're going to be camping out here. We've done it many years in a row. Oh, you look to be about the same age as these boys. I'm actually heading in there to meet them now. Okay. My sleeping bag here, and the tent, and, you know, the essentials. Hmm.
869.62 872.62 speaker2  Yep.
871.62 883.94 speaker1  One final question.
880.02 889.86 speaker2  where might it be that we could find you if we're out looking for you? Hopefully that doesn't come to this, but where might we find you?
887.86 897.34 speaker1  I'd definitely run back out here to the parking lot. Yeah, that's a smart answer.
895.18 918.02 speaker2  Is it part of the woods, seemingly? All right, well. And you look behind him, and you see there are a couple of clipboards, and like a fire extinguisher, and an ax, and a machete, and a flashlight, and that's about it in here.
916.52 942.50 speaker1  leads on that? That's kind of weird that it's all happening all of a sudden.
937.26 948.30 speaker2  the ranger service, and I am here to make sure everything gets taken care of, sweeping up the issues and whatnots.
946.90 951.94 speaker1  Is that where them people going?
950.94 955.46 speaker2  Do you know? I don't.
954.46 1018.50 speaker1  You checked around? For what? Missing people. Who? The people that have been missing. Nothing. Thanks. Thanks, Buzz. That would be a good time to see you again. That's true. Thanks. See you in the morning. Bye. Yeah.
1017.50 1047.74 speaker2  What's up, guys? Hello. For our listeners, you're hearing three voices that are not Thomas, Joe, and Luke. to do for a long time, which is run two different groups inside the same sandbox and see what happens. So first off, we have a brand new voice on the podcast, and that is our good friend,
1046.74 1052.74 speaker1  Lindsay. Hello. My name is Lindsay. What?
1051.74 1055.66 speaker2  Welcome.
1052.74 1074.66 speaker1  Welcome to the podcast. I'm so sorry. For yourself? As for the way I've acted.
1069.70 1079.18 speaker2  So Lindsay, right off the bat, do you have any RPG experience?
1076.66 1081.18 speaker1  I am on a D&D campaign currently. My first one.
1080.18 1084.46 speaker2  Nice. And are you enjoying it thus far? Yes.
1083.46 1090.90 speaker1  And it's your first time role playing? Sort of. I was in Thespians growing up. That's sort of the same thing.
1089.90 1098.26 speaker2  The Thespian Society? The Thespians. Yeah. I was in The Thespian Society too.
1094.22 1099.26 speaker1  I don't know if our listeners would believe that or a bunch of drama nerds.
1098.26 1103.70 speaker2  Yeah. Shocker.
1102.70 1127.94 speaker1  About me in real life? Yeah. Okay. This is the one I always use. My great uncle by blood is Phil Jackson, the ex-coach of the Lakers in the bowl school. What? Yeah. I don't talk to him. Yeah. My brother used to write him letters and stuff. Yeah. He actually got some free tickets. Wow. I can't wait to know that. Can we offer that to our listeners?
1126.94 1129.94 speaker2  Absolutely. What's his address?
1128.94 1135.82 speaker1  Oh my God.
1133.82 1137.82 speaker2  She's like the zen master. I know.
1136.82 1140.82 speaker1  He wears a crystal around his neck. Oh my God. Yep.
1139.82 1142.82 speaker2  Oh my God.
1141.82 1143.82 speaker1  Oh yes.
1142.82 1154.26 speaker2  Every day.
1151.06 1159.82 speaker1  makes it more special, magic crystal. And I'm not going to tell you what it does, so you're just going to have to watch out.
1157.24 1160.82 speaker2  If you tell us what it does, will it not work anymore?
1159.82 1166.18 speaker1  Truly. Yes.
1165.18 1169.14 speaker2  Ali.
1166.18 1173.34 speaker1  Ali Jepsen is also- That's a joke. My husband makes jokes.
1171.92 1189.38 speaker2  Thank you for pointing out my jokes. I really hope that you do that throughout your entire tenure on this podcast. Yeah. As long as you say it exactly like that.
1188.38 1191.38 speaker3  Oh. Got it.
1190.38 1204.42 speaker2  Speaking of Ali. Ali Jepsen. Oh, can we say your last name? Did I dox you? No, you're fine. All right. Ali, welcome back. Of course. On the podcast for our listeners. Long live Brett. Long live Brett.
1203.42 1208.42 speaker3  Did Brett die? Brett died. But he's a robot, you know? Long die Brett.
1207.42 1216.30 speaker1  Robots come back.
1211.42 1226.22 speaker2  Please, if this is your first episode, go back and listen to our back catalog. You might just be here to listen to Ali and Taylor and Lindsay and that's fine, but the
1225.22 1229.22 speaker3  in. True.
1228.22 1238.34 speaker1  You made a mistake. Well, all right.
1237.34 1243.98 speaker2  This is Zach. Every single time that you speak, you should joke.
1242.98 1249.88 speaker3  She said that. Joke. No one takes my jokes.
1248.66 1252.22 speaker2  Ali, what's your favorite joke?
1249.88 1260.74 speaker3  My favorite joke? What's the favorite joke that I've said?
1256.80 1270.30 speaker1  When I was in fourth grade, I had no friends and I thought this joke will help me.
1267.70 1271.30 speaker3  The needle said, need a little help there?
1270.30 1273.30 speaker2  Ooh.
1272.30 1285.10 speaker3  And I still didn't have friends. Because friends of myself. To this day. To this day.
1281.06 1290.10 speaker2  I'm excited to have you both on and you are both part of- Basement cast. Yeah, a comedy group. A comedy show.
1289.10 1335.98 speaker3  Can I be on it? I sort of thought that on the podcast was the appropriate time for me to ask to be on the show because you can't say no to my jokes. Joke. Is that an appropriate time to say thank you? PDM. The DM. What's PDM? The Game Master DM. Yeah, welcome.
1331.62 1342.22 speaker2  And if you had one extra hour of free time a day, how would you use it?
1339.70 1361.70 speaker3  You're not supposed to say which cat you like more than the other. I like Ramona and Northern Ropo. They can understand. I know you feel that way. Which makes me want to choose Ropo because she's lonely. But I also kind of really like Ramona. It's hard to say. They're so different from each other.
1359.10 1365.70 speaker2  And that's enough cat talk for the podcast. Thanks for listening this far.
1364.70 1379.70 speaker3  Oh my god. It's not a joke, it's the percast. It's a podcast.
1378.70 1396.70 speaker2  That is disgusting. And I didn't change the screen for it.
1395.70 1400.70 speaker4  Wow. I don't smell anything.
1397.70 1432.94 speaker2  That was an appropriate time to inhale into the microphone. But like I just said, if we could not do that during the recording session, that would be phenomenal. You are disgusting. No inhaling. On this show, otherwise I have to edit out.
1431.94 1443.18 speaker3  This is not a time for comedy. You are being very inappropriate.
1442.18 1464.18 speaker2  to start that way. And these characters all go to the same high school, which is the Silas Cole K through 12 in contention. We'll get into more of that later. Allie, tell us about your character.
1462.18 1469.42 speaker1  She's great.
1467.42 1493.66 speaker3  She's a senior. Does she have like one of those Kringle shirts that when you buy it, it looks like it could fit a doll and then it expands? Yes.
1491.66 1498.66 speaker1  This is not one size fits all. She never says the right thing.
1496.66 1520.66 speaker3  She's very anxious. She's always nervous about stuff. school, but the odds are not in her favor.
1516.66 1531.90 speaker2  brother is Ken Kringlehoff, who's being played by Joe.
1525.90 1557.14 speaker3  Ken's the star child and I'm not a disappointment to my parents, but they're not super proud of where I am, which is like 17th row in band. Like just sit there with the tuba and pet it. And that's what you'll do. And that's what I do.
1555.14 1581.38 speaker2  Like you said earlier, he's the star child. Sorry, no big deal. Just the spawn of Satan and not Ken Kringlehoff.
1579.38 1650.86 speaker3  I have a crush on the coolest girl in school. Well, she's not the coolest, but she's like the rebel of school. Her name is Liz. My name is Liz. But Judy calls her Elizabeth because she thinks it's sexy and maybe one day Liz will realize. Judy and Elizabeth, man. It's a teen term, guys. I'm not popular or I try not to be. I don't know. From Greece?
1649.86 1654.86 speaker1  No, no, no.
1652.86 1655.86 speaker3  That's why I second guessed it.
1654.86 1657.86 speaker2  Rizzo from Greece, yeah?
1656.86 1663.10 speaker3  Yes. The original Lizzo. No, definitely not. I'm sorry. I take it back.
1662.10 1664.10 speaker1  Lizzo doesn't deserve that.
1663.10 1667.10 speaker3  No.
1666.10 1673.10 speaker2  I'm Sandra Dee. It's actually, fuck.
1672.10 1683.10 speaker3  God damn it. In high school, Zach played Danny DeVito. I did.
1682.10 1684.10 speaker2  I played Danny DeVito.
1683.10 1685.10 speaker4  Danny DeVito in Greece.
1684.10 1688.10 speaker2  Oh my God, Zach. As a sophomore in high school.
1687.10 1708.34 speaker3  That's real. He did that. I didn't know him back then. It's okay, because I didn't know him. Look at me.
1706.34 1716.34 speaker4  All right.
1715.34 1727.58 speaker3  Okay, yeah. So you're picturing Rizzo. I'm picturing Rizzo. Oh, no.
1725.58 1730.58 speaker4  Like a lamb, not the rat. Oh, shoot.
1729.58 1757.82 speaker3  That's not it. That's not the right one. So leather jacket, cigarette, Doc Martens, and bitch. Right? You already love Lizz.
1754.82 1760.82 speaker2  Try to make a likable character that way when I kill it, it'll be better.
1759.82 1761.82 speaker3  All right.
1760.82 1772.82 speaker2  Perfect. Taylor, you're also here.
1769.82 1782.06 speaker3  call me Shadow, I'm going to fucking lose my mind. Oh, shit. Just kidding. Okay, Sharon. My dad is listening to this, and I didn't say the F word. I have never said it in my entire life.
1781.06 1793.06 speaker1  I don't even know what it is.
1786.06 1809.30 speaker3  Okay, so Sharon Berryman used to be a cheerleader, like used to be popular, very bendy, come from money, and then a particular event happened in my life that led me in a different direction, and now I'm obsessed with death in all forms.
1808.30 1813.30 speaker2  Well, like-
1812.30 1860.78 speaker3  Great. Your classic deaths. I- Current death. My mid-death, yeah. Oh, mid-death, right. Yeah, but then I go to hospitals for like that new, new. Oh, shit. Jesus. Oh my God. 17. How'd she get in here? I used to be a candy striper, but then they kept finding me in the-
1859.78 1862.78 speaker2  Yeah.
1860.78 1880.78 speaker3  She's like, but don't you want to die? Well, the whole thing is like, I really want to speak to the other side. So I sort of, it's like prudent for me to be there for all processes of death.
1874.78 2005.98 speaker2  So we are going to kick off actually role playing in three, let's get the music. So the story starts inside the public library of contention, a place that we have seen before. It is a rarely used building because as one might suspect, the population of contention owns all their books. That one was just for me. Standing behind the entry desk, there are two individuals. One is either an extremely young or an extremely old man with a sweater vest and sleeve tattoos on both arms, I believe. The other one's a young man who is wearing a sweater with another sweater wrapped around over his shoulders. And on top of that one, he has a second sweater that is wrapped around his waist as well. And he is wearing gold rings on all of his fingers. And the young man in all the sweaters looks up at the three of you as you walk into the contention public library and he says, oh, hello. Thank you so much for coming to the contention public library, whatever it is that we could do for you today on a day such as this. Is there many lands within these pages that we can, I don't know if you know me. My name is Steven pages, cousin of the esteemed Carrie pages, valedictorian of Silas Cole. Your gentleman's ears perk up.
2001.98 2021.98 speaker4  I do wish you would tell me what it is you're looking for. Could you just go back, take us to what we want to look at without him coming with us?
2020.98 2028.98 speaker3  would be just fine.
2023.98 2051.98 speaker4  I'm so sorry for intruding on your girly time.
2045.98 2088.48 speaker2  Steven pages begins walking you to the back of the library and there is a small room in the back with a curtain over it and there's a sign that is hanging off of one nail and it says occult but the OC in front has been like crossed out and inside you find a bookshelf with six shelves and each shelf has one book on it and there is a shelf marked voodoo on
2086.38 2118.48 speaker3  I do want to voodoo. This is exactly the book that I was hoping would be here. Okay, if we just flip to page 419, we're gonna find exactly how to get rid of your
2114.48 2146.08 speaker4  Oh my god, that's like so mean of Britney to do. Right? You're beautiful. You're like so beautiful. He was so lucky to have you and you're so beautiful and pretty. And also smart. He was so lucky.
2142.88 2177.08 speaker2  necessary to performing this ritual. There's also a bit of fine print at the bottom of each page that states this book voodoo is merely a collection of rituals put together by a woman named Lulu Fufu Voodoo and is in no way associated with any religious ideologies or practices with a similar name. Also, page 419 notes this ritual must be performed surrounded by trees.
2174.08 2198.88 speaker3  There's a woods right by my house that would be perfect. We'll hold hands and bask in the moonlight the entire time. It'll be beautiful.
2197.88 2207.78 speaker4  Judy!
2206.48 2230.68 speaker2  I will start. You need the left pinky toe of a dead squirrel. Oh, okay. Allie, what is the second thing that you might need for this voodoo spell?
2227.68 2250.48 speaker3  by a calf that's menstruating.
2249.48 2253.48 speaker2  It says that in the book.
2252.48 2256.48 speaker3  Yep, voodoo do you.
2255.48 2262.48 speaker2  Do you voodoo. To do voodoo.
2261.48 2274.28 speaker1  The fourth and final? Fourth and final thing. The fourth and final thing.
2271.28 2279.28 speaker3  Which we all know is also bird poop.
2278.28 2286.28 speaker1  When a bird pees, it also poops. Is that why it's so runny? It's mixed. Oh my god.
2285.28 2288.28 speaker3  What, your bird? Yeah, it's mixed.
2287.28 2302.88 speaker2  Oh, hell. Smash cut to you guys slamming the book closed and then realizing that nobody has a library
2299.88 2317.04 speaker4  Dear, dear, dear, what will you do? fee.
2315.04 2324.88 speaker3  How do libraries work?
2323.88 2332.58 speaker4  Oh my goodness. We play bridge with them every Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.
2331.58 2345.10 speaker2  That's right. Me and my old friend, Gerald Fingersen, and your parents-
2341.66 2353.78 speaker4  Would you like a poppy seed muffin for your walk home? I'm allergic to poppies and peas. Oh my god, me too, twinsies.
2350.70 2417.64 speaker2  Smash cut to you guys leaving the library with the book. Smash cut to you guys on the side of the road, all bent over a dead squirrel, cutting in the sky. The mixture of both. how to get the blood part.
2411.76 2432.68 speaker3  Yeah, I do, but my question is, how the hell are we gonna get this goth cheerleader blood? What? Yeah. Does you not know that I used to be a cheerleader? Gross.
2429.60 2442.08 speaker2  And then Shadow does seven back bends in a row. Whatever the fuck that is.
2440.60 2471.08 speaker3  It's a gymnastics thing. It's easy, Liz. It's easy. You just take the nail of the squirrel toe and I scratch it on my finger and blood comes out. Well, where are you gonna put the blood? And then put it-
2470.08 2479.36 speaker4  Judy. Judy. I'm really sorry, Elizabeth. Please.
2475.08 2517.72 speaker3  I've done just this kind of ritual before and it always goes fine, okay? Well, it's already- Get the vial. It's my ex. his blood after.
2512.76 2524.16 speaker4  If Elizabeth doesn't care, I don't care either.
2521.96 2540.24 speaker3  We'll go have a sleepover at my house. My parents are, like, totally chill and they don't care about anything, even me.
2538.68 2573.36 speaker2  But they really want you to laugh. Let's cut back to that scene. The bell rings and you guys are all standing outside of one of your lockers. Hey, Liz.
2570.36 2585.84 speaker3  I'm just trying to start a nice conversation with you. Could you just, like, not be a bitch for one second? Could you just, like, get to the point? Yeah, that's a really good point.
2582.76 2594.16 speaker2  I forgot my name, but I was in the last episode.
2590.72 2633.24 speaker3  It's just a budding friendship that's gonna happen, probably. cheating on you. What? Oh, you didn't know? With fucking who? I don't know, some girl named, like, Britney. I think she goes to, like, Spinkbonk High, which is, like, 15 miles down the road. Fucking Spinkbonk? I know, it's, like, most of them are total trash, but, like, I think she's kind of cute.
2632.24 2649.76 speaker4  There's literally no way. I mean, there's a way, but... No, like, she couldn't be cuter than you. What a- what a be-on.
2645.60 2657.00 speaker3  anymore and I just, like, really want to be there for you right now.
2652.12 2677.48 speaker4  Can we, like, touch you or help you in any way?
2675.48 2688.48 speaker3  Um, my name's Judy.
2684.48 2715.88 speaker4  a lot, even though I think it's not really perfume, I think it's just the cigarettes that you chew up after you smoke them. Get your shit together, Judy. I collect trash off the side of the road because I'm a good person. It's not just the trash.
2714.88 2720.28 speaker2  That's really cool. That's, like, art, man.
2719.28 2727.28 speaker3  Are you gay Arnold style? Like, in your closet?
2724.28 2736.28 speaker4  It's not Arnold.
2733.28 2744.28 speaker3  Yeah, whatever, I'm already over it, but here's the deal. I'm gonna need your help. I mean, I'm kind of busy on...
2743.28 2746.28 speaker4  You can totally reschedule that.
2745.28 2749.68 speaker1  You have time. I know your schedule. I have orchestra rehearsal.
2748.68 2763.18 speaker4  Shadow, Shadow, listen, we can help her. I'll help you. I'll do your orchestra for you.
2758.68 2795.28 speaker2  Smash cut to you guys in the car on the way to the woods that night after you've spent some time at Shadow's house and Shadow is, like, holding up the vial, like, flicking it and it's got her blood already inside of it and you guys have all of the ingredients necessary to do voodoo and who is driving? And three, two, one point at the person who's driving. Three, two, one. That is two points at Shadow, one point at Judy. So, Shadow is driving. Shadow, what kind of car do you have?
2789.28 2799.28 speaker3  So, my parents have a ton of money, so I have a Lamborghini. Shit. Weird.
2798.28 2802.28 speaker2  Super weird.
2801.28 2812.28 speaker3  Weird flex, but all right. It's what I always chose in the game Mash for my car. Mash. Mash.
2811.28 2815.28 speaker2  We were very into beetles. Yeah, is that going to happen?
2813.28 2825.28 speaker3  I just had this conversation over the weekend. Lamborghini 2017, even though it was 2013 when this all went down. Nope, not even close. Yeah, times don't matter. Nope. Oh, it's the 90s.
2824.28 2850.28 speaker2  Times don't matter. Oh, it's the 90s. It is a 2017 Lamborghini, and you guys are flying down the road to the contention woods. When you turn right onto the gravel road that takes you into the parking lot of the contention woods, I need you to roll a drive check for me.
2849.28 2852.28 speaker3  I'm sorry.
2851.28 2895.28 speaker2  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I got a 4. There is a possum that walks directly in front of you, and you dodge. You drive however best you see fit. There's a possum staring you directly in the eyes. You can see that there is fear in its ears. It looks, and then it turns, and it sits on its back legs and just freezes right in the
2889.28 2932.28 speaker3  I immediately pull over to go examine. Feel free to chip in with your thoughts on what I'm doing at any time. He's definitely in a better, or different, or maybe non-existent place, but I'm so happy for him.
2930.28 2948.28 speaker4  I have a question. Do possi- What is that? Do they could happen when they die?
2943.28 2999.28 speaker3  that's what you want to tell yourself, Judy, then that's fine. Yeah, can we bury Stacy? Okay, does anyone ... Oh, wait, it's my car. Let me go grab my cemetery shovel, and we'll scrape him off the pavement. My God. Just to piss Judy off.
2993.28 3052.28 speaker2  You look up, and you see that you are already in the parking lot of the Contingent Woods, and looking around, you see five cars. One car has a notice on the driver's side window taped to it. Another car has a boot on one of the wheels. There is also an old Bronco, like an SUV, got a lift kit on it, and it is right up next to this little shack at the entrance, like the Park Ranger shack. You would also notice a 91 Firebird that belongs to the older brother of Ash Hornbeam, and you would know the older brother of Ash Hornbeam is like a party animal. And then also, Judy, your mom's minivan.
3045.28 3059.28 speaker4  Guys, I don't want to freak you out right now, but I'm pretty sure that's my mom's minivan that's parked here.
3056.28 3067.28 speaker3  What if I get in trouble for being here? You're 17 years old, Judy.
3066.28 3078.28 speaker4  My God.
3074.28 3080.28 speaker3  I'll shove you down into a ditch. That would be really good.
3079.28 3089.28 speaker4  Do you promise to shove me in the ditch? Promise me. I promise.
3086.28 3107.28 speaker3  I would love to shove you into a ditch right now.
3106.28 3158.28 speaker2  Yeah. Is it Halloween? Nope, it is fall, but. Spooky times. She is wearing a forest ranger uniform that is a state forest ranger uniform. I believe Shadow, since she comes out here often and bathes in the moonlight nude. Normally, there's a guy named Jeb who's a contention park ranger, but this is a different guy. to fill out some forms over here for me in the shack.
3155.28 3175.28 speaker3  Did you decide to be a ranger because your name has wood in it? Anyway.
3174.28 3194.28 speaker1  This is Lindsey.
3193.28 3195.28 speaker2  That is what I assumed.
3194.28 3222.28 speaker3  Pre and post nakedness. I was a little disturbed. Oh, okay. Alright. Pre and post, but not mid. Not dirt. Yeah. Alright. Just making sure. Only the squirrels and the trees. My psyche was bothered.
3220.88 3231.28 speaker2  to get these forms filled out.
3227.28 3279.28 speaker4  I'll just put, my name is Jude. beneath the shadow of the moon. Moon.
