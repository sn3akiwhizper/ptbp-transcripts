00:00.000 --> 00:05.720
Well bake me a cookie and call me a monster, because I'm here to gobble y'all up.

00:05.720 --> 00:07.480
Nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom

00:07.480 --> 00:14.720
It's your dessert demon daddy, Wolf the Dog, and I'm here to consume your delicious sugary morsels.

00:14.720 --> 00:23.800
I am coming at you live from 694.2 PTBP, the only radio station that runs off of pure glucose.

00:23.800 --> 00:30.120
Fill me up a tub with maple syrup, because it's time to relax and check in with our newest segment,

00:30.120 --> 00:31.640
Howlin' with Wolf.

00:31.640 --> 00:36.360
This Howlin' with Wolf comes from Zachary Fredrickson in Phoenix, Arizona,

00:36.360 --> 00:39.800
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod.

00:39.800 --> 00:46.640
The quickest way to tell your friends you're a nerd who loves putting apples where you can't tan without some effort.

00:46.640 --> 00:51.000
Thanks to Zachary for doing that, and what a great name too.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.720
Anywho, he writes,

00:52.720 --> 01:00.360
I wanna thank my pal, Eld, from the Lancer and PTBP discords for getting me into the show.

01:00.360 --> 01:04.880
And the boys from Contention for getting me into Delta Green as a whole.

01:04.880 --> 01:12.640
I've been a handler for a few times now, and using the lessons I've learned by listening means it's always a great time.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.160
Eld, we gotta play together again sometime.

01:16.160 --> 01:20.320
If anybody was interested in a different type of actual play,

01:20.320 --> 01:30.240
check out at FTLcast on Twitter for a ton of great GM-less role-playing games and LGBTQ plus voices.

01:30.240 --> 01:31.720
Keep it up, boys!

01:31.720 --> 01:33.760
Thanks for writin' in, Zachary.

01:33.760 --> 01:40.320
I've only met one other Zachary in my entire life, and I've gotta say, wasn't a big fan.

01:40.320 --> 01:43.680
But you, Zachary, I'm a big fan of yours.

01:43.680 --> 01:45.960
Thanks for writin' in, buddy.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.920
But to that other Zach, you know who you are.

01:49.920 --> 01:53.120
And you know I'm comin' for you, baby.

01:53.120 --> 01:57.000
If you wanna write up something for your sugary sweet wolf to howl,

01:57.000 --> 02:01.160
go ahead and write up a five-star review on Apple Podcasts,

02:01.160 --> 02:05.320
and email a screenshot to pretendingpod at gmail.com,

02:05.320 --> 02:11.440
or tag at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter, and seriously, it's time.

02:11.480 --> 02:16.080
I know you've been considerin' it for a while, and never took the initiative,

02:16.080 --> 02:22.600
but it's time to demand that your friends, coworkers, and baristas start listenin' to this show.

02:22.600 --> 02:26.680
Think of how easy it would be to have conversations with them

02:26.680 --> 02:30.480
if they could debate who the worst cop in contention is,

02:30.480 --> 02:35.800
or what's goin' on with Maggie Cook, or what the fuck I am,

02:35.800 --> 02:41.040
all while you listen to Justin's original soundtrack on our YouTube page.

02:41.040 --> 02:48.920
And then, you can both get your Splashylvania FastPasses over at patreon.com slash pretendingpod

02:48.920 --> 02:52.920
for an absolute cavalcade of bonus content.

02:52.920 --> 02:56.920
Go ahead and click Details on this here episode,

02:56.920 --> 03:00.560
because the links are indeed in the show notes.

03:00.560 --> 03:06.200
The Segway is a two-wheeled, self-balancing personal transporter

03:06.200 --> 03:09.160
brought to market in 2001.

03:09.160 --> 03:11.640
And this is the news.

03:11.640 --> 03:18.200
Last time, the group relived a short chunk of time thanks to the chantin' of Don D. Pettymore.

03:18.200 --> 03:24.840
The second attempt was much better for Keith Beans and much, much worse for Jack Russell,

03:24.840 --> 03:27.760
who was skewered by the rabbit ball.

03:27.760 --> 03:34.840
After John Lee Kevinmore the 3rd realized his goo magic is perhaps endlessly powerful,

03:34.880 --> 03:40.960
He created a portal to the other stilted bunker, where Keith had just walked through the hatch door.

03:40.960 --> 03:48.280
Clark and John narrowly escaped the wild ball, leaving Leo Piston to yet another hellish experience.

03:48.280 --> 03:55.480
Don D followed the boys into this new plane of existence, and John closed the gate behind them.

03:55.480 --> 04:02.840
Standing on glowing ground, they saw a towering building made of darkness in the distance.

04:02.840 --> 04:08.280
More attention, though, was paid to the monumental pipe floating above them.

04:08.280 --> 04:14.120
The inside walls of this tube exude the same bright light they all stand on,

04:14.120 --> 04:20.040
and lumbering across the luminous land of this cylinder is an indescribable beast.

04:20.040 --> 04:24.920
Taking us now to the scene of a literally breathtaking roar

04:24.920 --> 04:30.040
is Dragon N3 with What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?

04:32.840 --> 04:43.800
Bad girls on top of the water, Mary and Caroline I'm on the borderline

04:43.800 --> 04:51.800
Leaving my mind at your altar Crossing the double line, doing it every time

04:51.800 --> 04:57.800
Tell me, what kind of world are you livin' in?

05:00.600 --> 05:06.600
What kind of world are you livin' in?

05:09.240 --> 05:21.720
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1st and 2nd Samuel, 1st and 2nd Kings, 1st and 2nd Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Limitations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos,

05:21.720 --> 05:37.720
Job, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1st and 2nd Thessalonians, 1st Timothy, 2nd Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews and James, 1st Peter, 2nd Peter, 3 John's, Jude, Revelation

05:37.720 --> 05:43.160
No, it's Justin, Joe, Luke, Thomas, and Zach.

05:43.160 --> 05:44.920
He always mixes that up though.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.120
That's who's in the call tonight.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.280
I've just gotten used to it.

05:48.280 --> 05:52.200
Philemon, please roll sanity.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.800
I've made a turnaround, guys.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.880
You're like way into Jesus again.

05:56.880 --> 06:04.400
I'm like super into Jesus again, and I think that we need to cleanse this show of our wickedness

06:04.400 --> 06:10.720
in our terrible, terrible, sinful ways, and I think we should start off this episode with

06:10.720 --> 06:11.720
a prayer.

06:11.720 --> 06:12.720
I'm good.

06:12.720 --> 06:13.840
Okay, perfect.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.960
That means you're in, right?

06:15.960 --> 06:17.600
Hold on.

06:17.600 --> 06:23.520
This is really weird, but my cousin literally just texted me and said this, got high and

06:23.520 --> 06:24.720
had ideas.

06:24.720 --> 06:29.680
What if the Carcano rifle Oswald used was a gun in a Delta Green setting, and every

06:29.680 --> 06:32.800
third bullet was magic?

06:32.800 --> 06:39.440
That's a good Delta Green gun.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.800
Did H.W. Bush cast the spell on the gun?

06:42.800 --> 06:45.760
Yeah, I don't know Delta Green lore.

06:45.760 --> 06:50.720
Zach, do you think God could make an apple so big that even he couldn't fit it up his

06:50.720 --> 06:54.720
ass?

06:54.720 --> 06:59.960
No.

06:59.960 --> 07:03.120
There's nothing too big that it couldn't fit up God's ass.

07:03.120 --> 07:07.280
There's no problem too big for that.

07:07.280 --> 07:12.000
I think G.K. Chesterton and C.S. Lewis argued about that point a lot.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.960
Yeah, who won?

07:14.960 --> 07:15.960
The apple.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.680
Yeah, the apple always wins.

07:18.680 --> 07:26.680
When there's one set of footprints, C.S. Lewis won, I think.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.680
Dear Father God.

07:28.680 --> 07:34.080
Are you one of the, are you the poopy kind?

07:34.080 --> 07:39.080
No, no, more of a Paul guy than a Peter guy, personally.

07:39.080 --> 07:42.800
This is like when you asked us to roleplay playing golf.

07:42.800 --> 07:48.480
You guys should get more hobbies, like...

07:48.480 --> 07:49.480
Golf and religion.

07:49.480 --> 07:50.480
Golf and religion.

07:50.480 --> 07:53.480
That's the kind of guy I would love to do.

07:53.480 --> 07:59.520
You guys should really expand your world view into more like traditional white American

07:59.520 --> 08:05.280
things like fundamentalist Christianity and golf.

08:05.280 --> 08:07.760
Wouldn't kill you all to broaden your horizons.

08:07.760 --> 08:14.360
All I'm thinking about is how many golf balls versus apples and there's a lot, a lot more

08:14.360 --> 08:16.500
golf balls you could fit in there.

08:16.500 --> 08:17.980
So maybe I will take it up.

08:17.980 --> 08:23.360
They do flush golf balls down toilets to show like how, how much water pressure there is

08:23.360 --> 08:24.360
or whatever.

08:24.360 --> 08:26.920
And toilets are kind of like butts because you poop into them.

08:26.920 --> 08:27.960
Wait, I'm sorry, what?

08:27.960 --> 08:30.840
You know, like they show like the water pressure or whatever.

08:30.840 --> 08:34.360
They put a bunch of golf balls in a toilet and flush it and it's like, look how much

08:34.360 --> 08:36.320
stuff you can flush down this toilet.

08:36.320 --> 08:38.800
Because you got to see how powerful that flush is.

08:38.800 --> 08:39.800
You got to know.

08:39.800 --> 08:41.640
I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.

08:41.640 --> 08:45.560
It sounds like a guy just came over to your house and like pranked you.

08:45.560 --> 08:46.560
Like what?

08:46.560 --> 08:48.880
He's like, yeah, I'm a plumber, but really it was just like doing everything you could

08:48.880 --> 08:49.880
to break your toilet.

08:49.880 --> 08:50.880
Right.

08:50.880 --> 08:51.880
And he put a little...

08:51.880 --> 08:52.880
Yeah.

08:52.880 --> 08:57.920
We call this the golf ball test.

08:57.920 --> 08:58.920
Look it up.

08:58.920 --> 09:01.280
Golf balls and toilets is the thing.

09:01.280 --> 09:02.880
You can't run with us.

09:02.880 --> 09:03.880
All right.

09:03.880 --> 09:04.880
Uh, let's...

09:05.280 --> 09:06.280
Are you okay, Zach?

09:06.280 --> 09:14.680
You had like a real flustered moment after that.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.440
It sounds to me like Justin's not a part of the turbo team.

09:17.440 --> 09:24.360
Uh, let's go ahead and get into the, what happened at the end of last session, which

09:24.360 --> 09:32.000
is that John created a fucking portal, uh, with his goo magic.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
What are you calling that, Thomas?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.580
Does that, does that sound right?

09:34.580 --> 09:40.100
You know, my, my ooze abilities, my, I guess we would say muck magic for alliteration,

09:40.100 --> 09:41.100
but we've never called it the muck.

09:41.100 --> 09:43.700
I like alliteration clearly this arc.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.560
Muck sounds like something fun we could call it.

09:45.560 --> 09:49.260
That's also like down homie and would be appropriate for these characters.

09:49.260 --> 09:50.260
Muck magic.

09:50.260 --> 09:51.260
I like that a whole lot.

09:51.260 --> 09:52.260
Muck magic.

09:52.260 --> 09:54.060
We're fighting the muck, but I guess I'm from the muck.

09:54.060 --> 09:55.940
I always knew that.

09:55.940 --> 09:57.060
How do you feel right now?

09:57.060 --> 10:01.140
You just said without thinking about it, talking about the current campaign, we're fighting

10:01.140 --> 10:02.140
the muck.

10:02.140 --> 10:07.380
Uh, there's a bit of a two minded nature there happening within you, I'd imagine.

10:07.380 --> 10:09.380
No, no, no real conflicts.

10:09.380 --> 10:10.380
Okay.

10:10.380 --> 10:11.380
All right.

10:11.380 --> 10:12.380
Good.

10:12.380 --> 10:13.380
Good.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.380
Very straightforward stuff.

10:14.380 --> 10:19.100
You know, you can put, you could, John, John Lee Pettymore is a very strong personality

10:19.100 --> 10:22.180
and it doesn't really matter what form you put it in.

10:22.180 --> 10:24.620
It's pretty sure it's John.

10:24.620 --> 10:26.060
What's your goal though?

10:26.060 --> 10:30.980
Well, you know, even if I was made of this world, I'm from our world.

10:30.980 --> 10:33.500
I'm our, I'm fighting for it.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.780
I'm with us.

10:34.780 --> 10:35.820
The muck needs to go back.

10:35.820 --> 10:38.220
I'm not going to go, you know, I'm one of the good ones.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.220
That's the right answer.

10:39.220 --> 10:40.220
You can stay.

10:40.220 --> 10:47.900
So you guys make it through this portal and into a new world that Keith has seemingly

10:47.900 --> 10:50.360
led you through this hatch.

10:50.360 --> 10:57.100
You heard a ring-a-ding-ding from the other side of this door that you then walked into.

10:57.100 --> 11:03.460
John closed the portal behind you and the hatch door that you walked through disappeared

11:03.460 --> 11:05.740
along with it.

11:05.740 --> 11:12.140
And as you guys look around, you see the ground you all stand on.

11:12.140 --> 11:13.820
It's made of light.

11:13.820 --> 11:20.680
There's a soft glow that illuminates this new world from below and every direction surrounding

11:20.680 --> 11:24.940
you, what could be called the ground meets what could be called the sky.

11:24.940 --> 11:28.620
And it's this blacker than black opaque darkness.

11:28.620 --> 11:35.180
And there's nothing on the horizon except for a single imposing building way off in

11:35.180 --> 11:37.980
the distance, dimly lit from below.

11:37.980 --> 11:45.820
But you can see that it's a slightly shiny pitch black, which I think would trigger your

11:45.820 --> 11:53.480
memories back to a specific picture that you found inside Julie Maxwell's crashed vehicle.

11:53.480 --> 11:58.100
But Keith doesn't notice any of that because he is staring straight up and each of you

11:58.100 --> 12:04.640
understand why he hasn't stopped staring when you follow his gaze up into a tube of pure

12:04.640 --> 12:06.800
light hanging above.

12:06.800 --> 12:13.320
The interior wall of this incandescent pipe is made of the same light you currently stand

12:13.320 --> 12:20.240
on and there seems to be only complete darkness beyond its well lit passage.

12:20.240 --> 12:25.200
So imagine, yeah, someone who is just extremely massive out of this world bigger than you

12:25.200 --> 12:31.880
is holding a them sized toilet paper roll above the world that you are in.

12:31.880 --> 12:37.880
The interior of the toilet paper roll is made of this pure light, but the outside of it

12:37.880 --> 12:40.260
is made out of pure darkness.

12:40.260 --> 12:45.640
And so you can see up through it past all the light is darkness as well.

12:45.640 --> 12:53.560
And inside this immense, resplendent toilet paper holder, consistently plotting the glowing

12:53.560 --> 13:00.120
terrain somehow simultaneously moving toward you and staying at a uniform range, there's

13:00.120 --> 13:07.200
this towering, lumbering beast seemingly made of the darkness that surrounds everything

13:07.200 --> 13:08.320
in this place.

13:08.320 --> 13:16.280
It walks on two massive legs the size of trees, its broad shoulders swing back and forth high

13:16.280 --> 13:18.780
above the glossy ground.

13:18.780 --> 13:26.200
As you all stare, its image seems to form and reform over and over like incomprehensible

13:26.200 --> 13:30.600
little glitches and you cannot fully make sense of its shape.

13:30.600 --> 13:35.120
Real quick, I'm not getting, I don't have a clear picture of the tube.

13:35.120 --> 13:38.280
Can you do it one more time or tell it to me in a different way?

13:38.280 --> 13:40.960
Yeah, I don't actually either understand.

13:40.960 --> 13:45.040
This creature is walking on the light plane inside the tube?

13:45.040 --> 13:54.320
Yeah, so imagine that gravity is pulling everything inside this tube to the walls of the tube,

13:54.320 --> 13:55.540
the internal walls.

13:55.540 --> 14:00.220
So this thing's walking on a different level of gravity from you guys.

14:00.220 --> 14:05.780
It's walking down, but it is clearly like on the wall of the tube.

14:05.780 --> 14:07.380
Like a hamster wheel?

14:07.380 --> 14:10.020
Yeah, like a sideways hamster wheel.

14:10.020 --> 14:15.940
So imagine that this notebook is what you guys are standing on, okay?

14:15.940 --> 14:22.780
Now above you is the toilet, I'm holding up a toilet paper roll above the notebook.

14:22.780 --> 14:30.860
From where you are, you can see all around, you basically just see a circle, like an oval

14:30.860 --> 14:32.980
in the sky made of light.

14:32.980 --> 14:38.820
But then as it moves around, this thing is not stagnant, it's kind of moving.

14:38.820 --> 14:44.560
It is always directly above you and also very much not all at the same time.

14:44.560 --> 14:50.320
So it is a round circle that then you can see as you're looking straight up, you are

14:50.320 --> 14:57.720
seeing the inside of this tube as well as through the tube into the darkness that is

14:57.720 --> 14:58.920
above it.

14:58.920 --> 15:05.300
Now inside the tube, if you guys are looking straight up, there is this creature inside

15:05.300 --> 15:07.520
the tube and it's massive.

15:07.520 --> 15:16.420
And I imagine the tube to be gargantuan in nature, we're talking hundreds of yards across.

15:16.420 --> 15:22.300
So this creature, while not taking up a ton of room inside of this tube, also you can

15:22.300 --> 15:25.440
see how huge this thing is.

15:25.440 --> 15:30.820
The creature is walking along it, but it could also be walking along this side or across

15:30.820 --> 15:37.340
the top or across the other side or across the bottom, always seemingly lumbering toward

15:37.340 --> 15:42.300
you and keeping the exact same distance away from you all at the exact same time.

15:42.300 --> 15:43.380
Is it bipedal?

15:43.380 --> 15:44.500
It is bipedal.

15:44.500 --> 15:48.140
Its feet are rooted on whatever side it's on, but its head is always in the middle.

15:48.140 --> 15:49.140
Yes.

15:49.140 --> 15:50.140
Cool.

15:50.140 --> 15:51.860
Which means that this thing is fucking huge.

15:51.860 --> 15:52.860
Good screenshots, Luke.

15:52.860 --> 15:53.860
Thank you.

15:53.860 --> 15:56.380
I knew those would come in handy.

15:56.380 --> 15:57.380
Does that make more sense?

15:57.380 --> 15:59.460
It does make more sense, for sure.

15:59.460 --> 16:01.900
Everyone notices, everyone rolls sanity.

16:01.900 --> 16:08.820
What about those of us that have maybe very little sanity?

16:08.820 --> 16:09.820
I failed.

16:09.820 --> 16:12.860
You should have rolled a three like me.

16:12.860 --> 16:16.460
I grabbed a different character sheet just off the top of a pile of character sheets

16:16.460 --> 16:19.020
and I was like, how do I have fucking 40 sanity?

16:19.020 --> 16:20.340
I'm kicking ass right now.

16:20.340 --> 16:24.060
Oh no, I've only got 10.

16:24.060 --> 16:32.180
Justin, Dondi Pettymore looks up and just has this like, of fucking course reaction.

16:32.180 --> 16:33.180
I failed my sanity.

16:33.180 --> 16:35.700
I failed, but not over my power.

16:35.700 --> 16:38.780
John Lee Kevinmore the third loses zero sanity.

16:38.780 --> 16:44.620
He just sees the agitation on the faces of those around him as they show the telltale

16:44.620 --> 16:47.700
signs of losing a little bit of their minds.

16:47.700 --> 16:50.460
And he then becomes agitated because it's like, what?

16:50.460 --> 16:55.980
Come on, guys, we go through this shit every day at this point.

16:55.980 --> 17:01.220
It's good to be in a game where you present a very, what you think is a very cool monster

17:01.220 --> 17:09.420
and then someone succeeds on their sanity check and says, I'm over it.

17:09.420 --> 17:13.900
It's not even, it's not even, you know, of course it's a cool monster, but like, is it

17:13.900 --> 17:14.900
breaking?

17:14.900 --> 17:18.180
Why is it still breaking your minds?

17:18.180 --> 17:20.980
Get over the world you knew and embrace, embrace the muck.

17:20.980 --> 17:23.140
Keith Vigna lose one sanity.

17:23.140 --> 17:26.280
Clark Bishop sees something a little bit different.

17:26.280 --> 17:31.640
Not only does Clark see what this is, but he also sees the history that he has with

17:31.640 --> 17:32.640
this creature.

17:32.640 --> 17:36.040
So I need you to roll a D4.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.040
It's a two.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.400
Lose two sanity.

17:38.400 --> 17:43.120
Hey, uh, Don, what did that phone look like?

17:43.120 --> 17:46.760
It looked like a old, like old school rotary phone.

17:46.760 --> 17:49.720
So that's not, that's not the phone we're looking for, is it?

17:49.720 --> 17:52.560
No, I do not think so.

17:52.560 --> 17:55.360
I can't say that that looks much like a rotary phone.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.240
I start running towards the building.

17:57.240 --> 18:01.360
Can we hear anything in this space other than the roars of the monster?

18:01.360 --> 18:04.540
There's a slight hum in the air in the distance.

18:04.540 --> 18:10.240
It's not completely silent, but you can't make out what the hum in the distance is.

18:10.240 --> 18:11.240
Where are they?

18:11.240 --> 18:13.360
Where are they?

18:13.360 --> 18:14.800
Where is who, Clark?

18:14.800 --> 18:15.840
The circle.

18:15.840 --> 18:17.700
The last time I was here, the circle was here.

18:17.700 --> 18:18.700
They were chanting.

18:18.700 --> 18:21.040
They were chanting to keep this creature at bay.

18:21.040 --> 18:22.040
I don't, I don't see them.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.040
I don't hear them.

18:23.040 --> 18:24.040
Where are they?

18:24.040 --> 18:25.040
This can't be good.

18:25.220 --> 18:26.220
This can't be right.

18:26.220 --> 18:27.220
This can't be right.

18:27.220 --> 18:28.220
This can't be right.

18:28.220 --> 18:29.220
This can't be right.

18:29.220 --> 18:30.220
This can't be right.

18:30.220 --> 18:31.220
This can't be right.

18:31.220 --> 18:32.220
That's the thing.

18:32.220 --> 18:33.220
That's the thing I've been telling you guys about.

18:33.220 --> 18:34.220
And the circle was keeping it here.

18:34.220 --> 18:35.220
And if they're not here, I don't, I don't know what's, I don't know what's going to

18:35.220 --> 18:36.220
happen.

18:36.220 --> 18:37.220
I don't know what's going on here.

18:37.220 --> 18:38.220
Do you remember what they were chanting?

18:38.220 --> 18:40.480
Hey handler, can I, Joe doesn't for sure.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.980
Could Clark do a role to see if he remembers?

18:42.980 --> 18:43.980
Yes.

18:43.980 --> 18:52.720
Do an intelligence at a, okay, I'm going to do negative 20 for how many lives you've lived

18:52.720 --> 18:54.360
since then.

18:54.360 --> 19:01.100
Another negative 20 for seeing this thing and being in its presence and then a third

19:01.100 --> 19:11.080
negative 20 for the sheer horror of being sent to another realm by a little bug that

19:11.080 --> 19:13.080
was attached to your foot.

19:13.080 --> 19:18.820
So I've got a 55 so I can only crit fail this.

19:18.820 --> 19:19.820
It's a 29.

19:19.820 --> 19:20.820
Okay.

19:20.820 --> 19:28.380
I thought I was giving you like a slight chance, not a zero chance, but even if it was negative

19:28.380 --> 19:29.380
40, he would have failed.

19:29.380 --> 19:31.620
No, I can't for the life of me remember what they were saying.

19:31.620 --> 19:33.300
I didn't really care about chance back then.

19:33.300 --> 19:34.340
I wasn't paying attention.

19:34.340 --> 19:39.140
Your mind was like fucking split in half in that moment when, when you got sent to this

19:39.140 --> 19:43.140
other plane of existence for a moment, honestly, I've been kind of hoping I could run into

19:43.140 --> 19:47.340
some of those circle of knowledge guys while we were here and they'd help us get back.

19:47.340 --> 19:49.980
So that kind of blows my pant plan out to shit.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.460
I don't, I don't know what's going on now.

19:51.460 --> 19:55.700
Well, I mean, if we could remember that chant, maybe, you know, we could go back and grab

19:55.700 --> 20:01.180
Leo and sit him here to die for eternity while he chants it, or we could at least say something

20:01.180 --> 20:02.180
temporarily.

20:02.180 --> 20:04.100
It seems like that's kind of a dead end though.

20:04.100 --> 20:07.860
Yeah, it'd be a good idea if I could just remember that damn chant.

20:07.860 --> 20:09.860
How far away has Keith gotten?

20:09.860 --> 20:12.380
I was going to say, am I actually making progress?

20:12.380 --> 20:13.380
Yeah.

20:13.420 --> 20:17.780
The world around you guys is stretching as Keith is running away from you.

20:17.780 --> 20:21.540
In my vision, is the building getting any closer to me?

20:21.540 --> 20:23.680
Yeah, ever so slightly.

20:23.680 --> 20:27.660
And then all of a sudden I need Thomas and Joe and Justin to take their headphones off.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.300
Uh oh, I hope I'm alive when they get back.

20:30.300 --> 20:36.620
Well, at least one of you probably will be as you are running.

20:36.660 --> 20:46.380
You are completely caught off guard by this humanoid figure hanging by its ankles.

20:46.380 --> 20:53.380
Some darkness has pulled itself and you see it's holding on to the bone right above the

20:53.380 --> 21:00.820
ankle and it is rubbed down through this man's pants to where the pants are cut and it is

21:00.820 --> 21:02.460
rubbed through the skin.

21:02.460 --> 21:08.300
There's blood pouring down the man's legs up toward his torso and then onto his face,

21:08.300 --> 21:13.180
a face that you recognize that is beet red.

21:13.180 --> 21:20.260
And there are two belts pulled tightly around his neck.

21:20.260 --> 21:26.700
The word fool is branded on his forehead.

21:27.460 --> 21:38.380
And Keith beans, you are looking directly into the face of Keith beans, your own face,

21:38.380 --> 21:40.720
maybe a year or two older.

21:40.720 --> 21:47.300
And he is wearing clothes that you recognize as clothes that you wore when you were going

21:47.300 --> 21:50.220
under the name Silas Cole.

21:50.220 --> 21:51.220
Damn.

21:51.220 --> 21:56.860
Well, so I'm running and this thing like just pops up in front of me and I smack right

21:56.860 --> 21:58.620
into the body.

21:58.620 --> 22:04.900
It takes me a second to realize and I look down and he's dead obviously, right?

22:04.900 --> 22:05.900
He's not.

22:05.900 --> 22:07.340
His face is completely red.

22:07.340 --> 22:12.180
You've you've kind of woken him up and you said he has two belts around his neck, two

22:12.180 --> 22:15.020
belts around his neck, no belts on his pants.

22:15.020 --> 22:20.740
I look and I see the belts and I want to try to like get them from around his neck, like

22:20.740 --> 22:26.340
take them off.

22:26.340 --> 22:30.060
Are you, who are you?

22:30.060 --> 22:32.980
Who are you?

22:32.980 --> 22:34.380
His eyes get huge.

22:34.380 --> 22:35.380
Keith.

22:35.380 --> 22:36.380
Yeah, that's me.

22:36.380 --> 22:37.380
It's me.

22:37.380 --> 22:38.380
It's you.

22:38.380 --> 22:39.380
It's me.

22:39.380 --> 22:45.700
Are you, are you Keith or are you, are you Silas?

22:45.700 --> 22:46.700
Yes.

22:46.700 --> 22:49.100
How'd you get here?

22:49.140 --> 22:51.140
She threw me through the hole.

22:51.140 --> 22:52.140
Who did?

22:52.140 --> 22:54.540
She threw me through the hole in the ground.

22:54.540 --> 22:55.540
Mary.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.540
Mary.

22:56.540 --> 22:58.100
How long you been here for?

22:58.100 --> 23:02.340
Oh, I guess that'd be like a bunch of years, right?

23:02.340 --> 23:03.340
Uh huh.

23:03.340 --> 23:04.340
Yeah, a bunch.

23:04.340 --> 23:09.820
Uh, you, he like tries to reach out to grab you and you see like his hands have been hanging

23:09.820 --> 23:13.620
down to the ground below his head for who knows how long.

23:13.620 --> 23:14.620
They're completely red.

23:14.620 --> 23:17.860
Uh, he seems to have no use of the fingers.

23:17.860 --> 23:24.060
So he's just kind of like prodding at you, uh, with these unmoving phalanges.

23:24.060 --> 23:31.340
And he's like, let me try to get you down.

23:31.340 --> 23:32.940
Get the blood out of your head.

23:32.940 --> 23:39.100
I want to like touch the goo, whatever is holding him up is, am I able to manipulate

23:39.100 --> 23:40.100
it at all?

23:40.100 --> 23:41.100
Yeah, it's malleable enough.

23:41.100 --> 23:42.100
You can manipulate it.

23:42.100 --> 23:45.820
I just try to pull him down and like stretch it out enough to where it breaks.

23:45.820 --> 23:51.220
Yeah, it's, it's honestly, it's being hung up by nothingness up into the air, up into

23:51.220 --> 23:58.100
the sky around you as if, uh, it is, it stretches out and then kind of snaps.

23:58.100 --> 24:00.580
I'm thinking like laughing, like Laffy Taffy.

24:00.580 --> 24:02.740
If you like stretched out Laffy Taffy.

24:02.740 --> 24:03.740
Yes.

24:03.740 --> 24:06.060
Perfectly dark Laffy Taffy.

24:06.060 --> 24:08.660
I don't know what, stand up.

24:08.660 --> 24:11.620
Can you stand up?

24:11.620 --> 24:16.020
There is no blood in the whole bottom half of his body.

24:16.020 --> 24:23.260
And so as he's trying to stand up, I start massaging him from his head down to try to

24:23.260 --> 24:24.260
put the blood back down.

24:24.260 --> 24:36.660
Yeah, I think like this seems like, that seems like the perfect moment for the rest of the

24:36.660 --> 24:40.460
group to come up and meet you.

24:40.460 --> 24:43.620
Tell you they're sorry.

24:43.620 --> 24:57.100
Okay, uh, Luke, go ahead and take off your headphones for a second while they catch up

24:57.100 --> 24:58.340
with you.

24:58.340 --> 24:59.340
Real quick.

24:59.340 --> 25:03.180
In all that time you were just with Luke, did he make it to, um, did we see him like

25:03.180 --> 25:04.180
go in the tower?

25:04.180 --> 25:05.220
No, no, no, no.

25:05.220 --> 25:09.580
He made it about a third of the way before you see that there's something else in the

25:09.580 --> 25:14.100
distance that he is, he's dealing with, uh, another body there.

25:14.100 --> 25:21.580
Uh, it was hanging upside down at first and then he like pulls it down to the ground.

25:21.580 --> 25:27.060
And then as you continue approaching, he kind of gets it up onto its feet.

25:27.060 --> 25:28.780
Can we make out the figure from here?

25:28.780 --> 25:30.500
Do we, is it a person?

25:30.500 --> 25:34.860
If you guys get to the point to where you can make out who it is, then I'll have Luke

25:34.900 --> 25:37.620
back on the call cause you guys will be within earshot.

25:37.620 --> 25:38.620
I'm good with that.

25:38.620 --> 25:39.820
Is Don with us?

25:39.820 --> 25:40.820
Yes.

25:40.820 --> 25:42.020
What about mentally?

25:42.020 --> 25:45.020
Not so much.

25:45.020 --> 25:49.780
Don's kind of muttering to himself about like the phone over and over again.

25:49.780 --> 25:54.020
Now that we've come in here, he's like, where, why did the phones, I thought we heard the

25:54.020 --> 25:55.020
phone in here.

25:55.020 --> 25:58.260
I don't, we need to find the phone.

25:58.260 --> 26:02.820
He's staring at the tube still while you guys are talking and muttering to himself about

26:02.820 --> 26:03.820
the phone.

26:03.860 --> 26:07.740
Good point Don, we did hear the phone from in here, so presumably the phone is somewhere

26:07.740 --> 26:09.740
around here.

26:09.740 --> 26:13.460
Yeah, we gotta, we gotta find, we gotta find that phone.

26:13.460 --> 26:15.820
John, your friends are weird.

26:15.820 --> 26:21.180
I think we need to get together and use this here petty more magic that we possess.

26:21.180 --> 26:26.340
I've been calling it muck magic, but I've taken to calling it as of late.

26:26.340 --> 26:27.340
That's wonderful.

26:27.340 --> 26:28.340
That's beautiful.

26:28.340 --> 26:31.540
Hey, you know, you know, Uncle Don, you seem, you seem just a little bit rattled.

26:31.540 --> 26:36.940
My muck magic, my, my spider senses, as it were, they're kind of sending me towards a

26:36.940 --> 26:37.940
Keith's direction.

26:37.940 --> 26:41.220
I think we should maybe go check that out and see, see if he's sure these friends of

26:41.220 --> 26:42.220
yours are reliable.

26:42.220 --> 26:43.860
We got an important mission right now.

26:43.860 --> 26:45.100
We got to find that phone.

26:45.100 --> 26:46.100
Oh Lord.

26:46.100 --> 26:51.600
No, but they are definitely connected with the phone and everything.

26:51.600 --> 26:56.160
So like it's, we sticking with them is probably the best direction towards that.

26:56.160 --> 26:57.740
If you think so.

26:57.740 --> 26:58.740
We got it.

26:58.740 --> 26:59.740
We got to find that phone.

26:59.740 --> 27:00.740
All right.

27:00.940 --> 27:08.620
So like I said, my, my, my muck Dar, my, my, my tingly connection to this world, you know,

27:08.620 --> 27:10.100
it seems to be pointing me towards Keith.

27:10.100 --> 27:11.100
Let's just head that way.

27:11.100 --> 27:15.340
And I grabbed him by the shoulder and I kind of, I kind of push him towards that direction

27:15.340 --> 27:17.220
and start walking with him and guiding him.

27:17.220 --> 27:21.260
I slap his arm off me and walk that direction by myself.

27:21.260 --> 27:23.980
Such a healthy family relationship.

27:23.980 --> 27:29.860
Not like a mean slap, but you know, I'm like, yeah, like uncles do.

27:29.860 --> 27:34.260
You know, an uncle slap.

27:34.260 --> 27:40.740
The three of you approach a site that I'm going to let Keith describe or Luke rather.

27:40.740 --> 27:48.260
So you see a man sitting on the ground in front of Keith and Keith is putting his hands

27:48.260 --> 27:51.900
around the man's head like this.

27:51.900 --> 27:54.220
We can see that, but you're going to have to describe it for the listeners.

27:54.220 --> 27:56.580
He's like two hand jerking off the whole head.

27:56.580 --> 27:57.580
Yeah.

27:57.580 --> 28:02.740
Like massaging his head with his hands around his head and like pushing down and then like

28:02.740 --> 28:10.820
going down his shoulders or like up his hands and down his body and like rubbing him down.

28:10.820 --> 28:18.300
And then as you get closer, you see that the man in front of him on the ground has just

28:18.300 --> 28:21.100
looks like all the blood is in his head.

28:21.100 --> 28:26.060
And after you kind of get over that, like the kind of purpley red on his full forehead

28:26.060 --> 28:29.540
is the brand fool.

28:29.540 --> 28:35.420
And after you see all that, you realize that the man is Keith beans.

28:35.420 --> 28:38.140
Oh shit.

28:38.140 --> 28:40.300
But he's got some old timey clothing on.

28:40.300 --> 28:41.300
Oh shit.

28:41.300 --> 28:43.740
Is he like visibly older or?

28:43.740 --> 28:46.580
Few years I think is what, not much.

28:46.580 --> 28:49.940
Is he responding to our Keith's touch at all?

28:49.940 --> 28:50.940
Oh yeah.

28:50.940 --> 28:51.940
Thank you.

28:51.940 --> 28:53.940
Thank you Keith.

28:53.940 --> 28:54.940
This is getting out of hand.

28:54.940 --> 28:56.940
Now there's two of them.

28:56.940 --> 28:57.940
Guys.

28:57.940 --> 28:59.860
I found me.

28:59.860 --> 29:01.500
It's Silas Cole.

29:01.500 --> 29:02.500
Yeah.

29:02.500 --> 29:07.900
What happened to make you sound like that?

29:07.900 --> 29:12.620
And he points it to belts that are on the ground and he points at his neck.

29:12.620 --> 29:16.180
He had these belts around his neck and he was hanging upside down and I'm just trying

29:16.180 --> 29:19.620
to get the blood back down into the rest of his body.

29:19.620 --> 29:24.140
And I'm still massaging his head.

29:24.140 --> 29:32.020
Oh God.

29:32.020 --> 29:37.940
I forget Keith that you did pass that EMT class so you do know exactly what to do in

29:37.940 --> 29:38.940
these situations.

29:38.940 --> 29:44.380
Hey Silas, Silas, Keith, put your arm, raise your arms up so the blood goes down into the

29:44.380 --> 29:46.380
rest of your body.

29:46.380 --> 29:47.660
His arms go up in the air.

29:47.660 --> 29:53.100
Keith, why does, why does Silas Cole look, it's you, but you said it's Silas.

29:53.100 --> 29:54.900
I don't, I don't understand.

29:54.900 --> 29:57.660
I thought I had told you this before, but.

29:57.660 --> 29:58.660
Yeah, you have.

29:58.660 --> 30:02.740
I'm just, I'm as Clark seeing two Keith's before him and you're calling one Silas.

30:02.740 --> 30:04.700
I feel like it needs to be reiterated.

30:04.700 --> 30:12.420
Well, just, he's Silas and I'm Keith, but I'm, I'm remembering now as a, as I see it,

30:12.420 --> 30:16.900
as I see him, uh, he said he got thrown into a hole and that's how he got here.

30:16.900 --> 30:24.180
And I remember when I was him, I got thrown in to a hole by Mary.

30:24.180 --> 30:29.140
But if I was him, but I'm me, but I.

30:29.140 --> 30:30.940
When did, when were you him?

30:30.940 --> 30:36.500
Uh, well, a long time ago, right?

30:36.500 --> 30:37.500
Roll sanity.

30:37.500 --> 30:48.420
Thomas, I'm sorry to bring it up again, but can you move the microphone in a better position

30:48.420 --> 30:49.420
for you?

30:49.420 --> 30:53.060
Uh, I, yeah, it's that or me like breathing right into the mic.

30:53.060 --> 30:54.060
Like yeah.

30:54.060 --> 30:55.060
Okay.

30:55.060 --> 30:56.060
I get that.

30:56.060 --> 30:59.100
It's just, when you do lean forward, then we get really, really good audio.

30:59.100 --> 31:01.060
But then when you don't, it isn't good.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.060
Yeah, I understand what you mean.

31:03.060 --> 31:08.580
But I think you're a great person and you're a good friend and a great role player.

31:08.580 --> 31:09.580
And I love you.

31:09.580 --> 31:10.580
I love you too.

31:10.580 --> 31:14.100
But I do take that all intensely personally and I'll never forgive you.

31:14.100 --> 31:15.100
Good.

31:15.100 --> 31:16.100
Good.

31:16.100 --> 31:17.100
That seems, that seems perfect.

31:17.100 --> 31:18.100
That seems right.

31:18.100 --> 31:20.940
But I, I have learned my lesson and I'll definitely just keep all that in mind and not like I'll

31:20.940 --> 31:22.980
keep that in practice.

31:22.980 --> 31:28.020
Luca, how'd you do on the sanity check?

31:28.020 --> 31:29.500
I failed.

31:29.500 --> 31:30.500
Regular fail.

31:30.500 --> 31:31.500
Okay.

31:31.940 --> 31:36.580
Just lose one sanity is you can't remember when you were Silas or when you were you and

31:36.580 --> 31:40.200
you think maybe that you're both at the same time right now.

31:40.200 --> 31:41.200
Isn't that you?

31:41.200 --> 31:42.200
I mean, it is you.

31:42.200 --> 31:43.200
Yeah.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.900
I look at, I look at him and I punched myself in the stomach.

31:45.900 --> 31:46.900
Did that hurt?

31:46.900 --> 31:47.900
No.

31:47.900 --> 31:48.900
Okay.

31:48.900 --> 31:49.900
Just.

31:49.900 --> 32:00.220
But I, there's so much pain going on in my throat and my head that I don't know if a

32:00.220 --> 32:03.060
stomach punch would really do much damage right now.

32:03.060 --> 32:06.940
I start rubbing his throat like you would a dog that you're trying to get to swallow

32:06.940 --> 32:10.940
a pill.

32:10.940 --> 32:14.820
Remember in Looper when they torture that guy by like removing parts of him in a different

32:14.820 --> 32:18.780
time and all of a sudden his little bits are gone in this time?

32:18.780 --> 32:19.780
That shit was crazy.

32:19.780 --> 32:20.780
That was crazy.

32:20.780 --> 32:24.780
God, I hope that doesn't happen to us.

32:24.780 --> 32:28.980
Just something to keep in mind if you ever, you know, get out of line, Silas.

32:28.980 --> 32:36.220
Not that we have that capability, but come on, you know, we could figure it out.

32:36.220 --> 32:38.620
You're a past version of, of Arky.

32:38.620 --> 32:39.620
Do you know us?

32:39.620 --> 32:41.620
Do you, are you, do you know who I am?

32:41.620 --> 32:42.620
Yeah.

32:42.620 --> 32:43.620
You're the overseer.

32:43.620 --> 32:49.260
Oh, you know me as the overseer.

32:49.260 --> 32:50.260
That's that's, that's kind of.

32:50.260 --> 32:51.260
No, you're Clark Bishop.

32:51.260 --> 32:52.260
You're my partner.

32:52.260 --> 32:55.260
But we talked about it like, oh, who's the chosen one?

32:55.260 --> 32:56.260
He's ball.

32:56.260 --> 32:58.940
You know, that's, I don't know you.

32:58.940 --> 33:03.660
And he points at Dawn and he's like, I don't know who you are, but I don't know who you

33:03.660 --> 33:04.660
are either.

33:04.660 --> 33:05.660
God damn it.

33:05.660 --> 33:09.540
Did you become Silas Cole after one of our days waking up in the mausoleum?

33:09.540 --> 33:16.780
Yeah, it was when you were up in the mausoleum and I went down underneath Bean's Pond and

33:16.780 --> 33:23.900
then I saw Tildy and I used the gun and I was Silas Cole.

33:23.900 --> 33:26.300
Am I going to have to rerecord all of your lines?

33:26.940 --> 33:30.260
Yeah, and you're going to have to, you're going to have to pop yourself in the throat

33:30.260 --> 33:32.380
a couple of times before you do.

33:32.380 --> 33:36.180
Yeah, he's, he's right.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.180
I remember now.

33:37.180 --> 33:44.140
So then, so then after you were thrown as Silas Cole into a hole, a, a Cole in a hole,

33:44.140 --> 33:46.300
then you woke up again in the mausoleum with us?

33:46.300 --> 33:47.300
No.

33:47.300 --> 33:48.300
No, not you.

33:48.300 --> 33:49.300
Our Keith.

33:49.300 --> 33:50.300
Sorry.

33:50.300 --> 33:51.300
Sorry.

33:51.300 --> 33:52.300
Not you.

33:52.300 --> 33:53.300
Oh, you want to hear mine though?

33:53.300 --> 33:55.500
Don't we, didn't we just figure yours out?

33:55.500 --> 33:57.780
Just the past, not the, not the present.

33:57.780 --> 34:02.380
Oh, I kind of assumed since you got here, you just been hanging, uh, what's, what's

34:02.380 --> 34:03.380
been going on?

34:03.380 --> 34:05.380
I just been hanging.

34:05.380 --> 34:06.380
Okay.

34:06.380 --> 34:07.380
Yeah.

34:07.380 --> 34:08.380
Yeah.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.020
But all the people I put here did this to me.

34:10.020 --> 34:12.180
Once you got here or before you got here?

34:12.180 --> 34:13.180
Once I got here.

34:13.180 --> 34:14.180
Gotcha.

34:14.180 --> 34:15.180
Okay.

34:15.180 --> 34:17.380
So there's, there's other people around and Clark starts looking around.

34:17.380 --> 34:19.140
What do you mean the people you put here?

34:19.140 --> 34:25.340
You remember when we put, when, when we put the people, when we put the people in here

34:25.340 --> 34:26.500
to get rid of them?

34:26.500 --> 34:30.740
Like the professor and the rancher.

34:30.740 --> 34:31.740
That's right.

34:31.740 --> 34:34.740
Cause we got the big judge, the big judge was Mary.

34:34.740 --> 34:35.740
Yeah.

34:35.740 --> 34:36.740
That's right.

34:36.740 --> 34:38.340
Mary got a hold of Judge Cortland.

34:38.340 --> 34:39.340
Good God, Keith.

34:39.340 --> 34:42.860
How many did you kill in the service of contentions founding?

34:42.860 --> 34:51.100
I mean, I, I really, when I was him, I had, I would say literally no control over my actions.

34:51.100 --> 34:52.100
Yeah.

34:52.100 --> 34:55.740
But isn't that just what the Nazi said?

34:55.740 --> 34:56.980
I'm not saying you're a Nazi.

34:56.980 --> 34:59.140
I'm just saying you're, you're saying like a Nazi.

34:59.140 --> 35:00.140
I'm not a Nazi.

35:00.140 --> 35:01.140
Yeah.

35:01.140 --> 35:02.540
But Silas says things like a Nazi.

35:02.540 --> 35:03.540
I'm Silas Cole.

35:03.540 --> 35:04.540
No, you said it.

35:04.540 --> 35:05.540
And I'm Keith.

35:05.540 --> 35:06.540
He's me.

35:06.540 --> 35:07.700
And no, but he's him.

35:07.700 --> 35:09.460
I'm not him right now.

35:09.460 --> 35:10.460
He is me though.

35:10.460 --> 35:11.800
I'm him, but he's not me.

35:11.800 --> 35:13.280
And I'm him, but I'm not him.

35:13.280 --> 35:18.300
I'm going to, we, we, we should draw a big mustache on one of you just in case we ever

35:18.300 --> 35:19.300
get you confused.

35:19.300 --> 35:24.760
You see the giant brand on one of the foreheads that says fool.

35:24.760 --> 35:27.140
No, I think a mustache would be...

35:27.140 --> 35:31.020
John still takes out a Sharpie and...

35:31.020 --> 35:32.020
And puts it on your Keith.

35:32.020 --> 35:34.960
A fancy little, yeah, on our Keith.

35:34.960 --> 35:35.960
Okay.

35:35.960 --> 35:38.460
There we go.

35:38.460 --> 35:41.900
Now we'll just remember Keith has, has the, the fetching.

35:41.900 --> 35:44.180
You better not draw a Hitler mustache on me.

35:44.180 --> 35:45.820
No, I didn't draw you Hitler mustache.

35:45.820 --> 35:49.880
I really like this fella named Jimmy Buffett and he's got a song called Pencil Thin Mustache

35:49.880 --> 35:53.660
about all the movie stars that you grew up watching.

35:53.660 --> 35:54.660
Yeah.

35:54.660 --> 35:55.660
It's on that.

35:55.660 --> 35:58.460
It's, it's a couple tracks after that I think on the greatest hits maybe.

35:58.460 --> 36:01.660
But yeah, you got a little, a nice little Clark Gable mustache.

36:01.660 --> 36:02.660
Well thank you.

36:02.660 --> 36:05.540
But maybe we gave it some, some fun little twists up at the end.

36:05.540 --> 36:06.540
Yeah, I think we did.

36:06.540 --> 36:07.940
Look, there's a happy little twist.

36:08.420 --> 36:11.620
You said Mary threw you in the portal.

36:11.620 --> 36:13.780
This question goes out to any Keith.

36:13.780 --> 36:16.620
How did you, how did, why did Mary turn on you?

36:16.620 --> 36:24.820
Well, Mary was his ball, you know, that I made, that he made, that we made, and it got

36:24.820 --> 36:26.220
into...

36:26.220 --> 36:27.220
He high fives you.

36:27.220 --> 36:28.220
I high five him back.

36:28.220 --> 36:29.220
How's his hands looking?

36:29.220 --> 36:35.780
As soon as he high fives you, he's like, ah, and like kind of shakes him, shakes him out

36:35.820 --> 36:40.660
because it would hurt so much if you high five someone with all the blood still like

36:40.660 --> 36:41.660
in your hands.

36:41.660 --> 36:49.940
I mean, yeah, so the ball that we made, ball, which is Mary, got in a big old guy, giant

36:49.940 --> 36:58.980
guy, and he, you know, basically killed, kind of got rid of us.

36:58.980 --> 36:59.980
A giant guy?

36:59.980 --> 37:00.980
Big old guy.

37:00.980 --> 37:03.540
Is that guy up there in the toilet paper tube?

37:03.540 --> 37:05.740
No, not that big.

37:05.740 --> 37:07.940
Also what do you know about that, I point up?

37:07.940 --> 37:11.820
You know, Clark was babbling a little bit about it, but it seemed like he, he had taken

37:11.820 --> 37:12.980
leave of his mind there.

37:12.980 --> 37:17.180
He seemed to think that there should, should be others, other people, other...

37:17.180 --> 37:21.860
Yeah, uh, Fool Keith, uh, you've been here for a while, have you seen other people around

37:21.860 --> 37:22.860
here?

37:22.860 --> 37:25.940
Have you seen, when I was here a long time ago, there were people who were kind of keeping

37:25.940 --> 37:27.540
that thing at bay, and I don't see them here now.

37:27.540 --> 37:30.220
Have you seen them go anywhere, do anything, or?

37:30.220 --> 37:34.820
They used to, ah, they used to, there used to be people there, yeah.

37:34.900 --> 37:35.900
What happened to them, do you know?

37:35.900 --> 37:39.500
Nope, they're just not there no more, but that thing's bigger now.

37:39.500 --> 37:44.140
You said you got kicked out of there, and I point to the building, you got kicked out

37:44.140 --> 37:45.140
of there?

37:45.140 --> 37:46.140
Who kicked you out?

37:46.140 --> 37:47.140
A long time ago.

37:47.140 --> 37:48.140
Who kicked you out?

37:48.140 --> 37:58.900
Gambler, named Thomas, uh, the professor, and the rancher, and, uh, bartender, the piano

37:58.900 --> 38:02.320
player, they were all super angry that I'd thrown them down here.

38:02.320 --> 38:03.900
Why were you throwing them down here again?

38:03.980 --> 38:05.980
Again, this goes out to either Keith.

38:05.980 --> 38:07.980
They were finding out about the residue.

38:07.980 --> 38:08.980
Right, right, right.

38:08.980 --> 38:09.980
Residue?

38:09.980 --> 38:10.980
I've been calling it a muck.

38:10.980 --> 38:11.980
Mmm, I like that.

38:11.980 --> 38:12.980
Good name.

38:12.980 --> 38:15.980
Wait, were we using the residue to make stuff?

38:15.980 --> 38:19.980
When we made stuff, the residue is the magical brite product.

38:19.980 --> 38:20.980
Okay.

38:20.980 --> 38:21.980
Silas?

38:21.980 --> 38:22.980
Nah.

38:22.980 --> 38:24.980
John, John's getting real serious here.

38:24.980 --> 38:30.980
So you're, you are the, the Keith who became Silas, and, and made ball?

38:30.980 --> 38:31.980
Yeah.

38:33.980 --> 38:37.980
At long last, this is my, my real daddy.

38:37.980 --> 38:38.980
Ahhh!

38:38.980 --> 38:45.980
And he reaches out, and he's gonna swipe, uh, some of the, uh, muck from your face,

38:45.980 --> 38:50.780
and he puts it on his thumb, and then he swipes it across your forehead, and he says,

38:50.780 --> 38:51.780
Simba!

38:51.780 --> 38:54.980
Did you just lie, you just lying king to me?

38:54.980 --> 39:00.780
Oh my god, I kneel down, I kneel down in front of him, and I start rubbing his head like

39:00.780 --> 39:01.780
Keith is.

39:01.780 --> 39:02.780
Yes!

39:03.660 --> 39:04.660
Thank you, Daddy.

39:04.660 --> 39:06.660
Thank you, thank you for accepting me, Daddy.

39:06.660 --> 39:08.660
Oh, you're beautiful.

39:08.660 --> 39:10.660
Thank you, I try, I hope I'll make you proud.

39:10.660 --> 39:12.660
Have you, have you had children?

39:12.660 --> 39:16.660
No, I'm a bit of, you know, I'm a bit of a, bit of a hound dog, bit of a bachelor,

39:16.660 --> 39:18.660
race car, former race car driver, you know.

39:18.660 --> 39:20.660
He, he puts out a fist to pound it.

39:20.660 --> 39:22.660
Yeah, I pound it.

39:22.660 --> 39:24.660
Can I ask you just one question, Daddy?

39:24.660 --> 39:26.660
Of course.

39:26.660 --> 39:28.660
Why did you bring me into this world?

39:29.540 --> 39:33.540
Well, it's tricky, because I, I already did.

39:33.540 --> 39:35.540
So then I did it again, because I already had.

39:35.540 --> 39:40.540
Ain't that just why parents keep having babies, you know, when you get right down to it?

39:42.540 --> 39:45.540
Just doing what's expected of you, or what you think's expected of you.

39:45.540 --> 39:47.540
I get it, I get it.

39:47.540 --> 39:50.540
Alright, so it's not like I was planned, but you had to do it, I get it, alright.

39:50.540 --> 39:54.540
I have as much of a valid reason for existing as any of these guys did.

39:54.540 --> 39:56.540
I think so, yeah.

39:57.420 --> 40:02.420
Silas, are you saying you only did things because they, it happened already?

40:02.420 --> 40:04.420
And you're just trying to do them?

40:04.420 --> 40:06.420
I didn't have to try.

40:06.420 --> 40:10.420
I just did what I did, and it happened to be the thing that already happened, because that's what I did.

40:10.420 --> 40:12.420
That's deep, that's like Eastern.

40:12.420 --> 40:14.420
You're so wise, Daddy.

40:16.420 --> 40:18.420
Wow, that is...

40:20.420 --> 40:22.420
Daddy, if we get out of here, can we have a catch?

40:24.420 --> 40:25.420
Of course.

40:26.300 --> 40:28.300
Right on, right on. Thanks, Pops.

40:28.300 --> 40:41.300
I hate to break this up as sweet as it is, but I, you know, before I ran right into you, I was trying to get to that building because of that, as I point up.

40:41.300 --> 40:50.300
And when you point up, you all look and see this thing, it has been getting a little bit closer, you think, than the last time you saw it.

40:51.180 --> 41:01.180
And you remember that this Silas Cole version of Keith did say that since the people around it have gone, that the thing has been getting bigger.

41:01.180 --> 41:15.180
And then you look back down at the building in the distance, and you all see, making its way toward you, across this twinkling terrain, is some sort of four-wheeled personal vehicle.

41:15.180 --> 41:18.180
Like a double-wide motorcycle.

41:19.060 --> 41:29.060
But as soon as it starts to get close enough for you all to recognize the wheelsman of this sort of smart car without the little doors or roof, a portal opens up right above it.

41:29.060 --> 41:40.060
A very similar portal to the John Made Hole you all just recently escaped through, and crashing down onto the back of this tricycle with the same amount of wheels in the front as in the back,

41:40.060 --> 41:50.060
is a gaunt woman with crazy hair and enormous thick glasses that make her already large eyes look even bigger.

41:50.060 --> 41:59.060
She wears jeans and a white t-shirt with a leather jacket, and four wiry metal tendrils protrude from the back of her neck.

41:59.060 --> 42:09.060
One dethrones the previous driver of this four-wheeler, tossing him behind like carelessly placed banana peels in Mario Kart.

42:09.060 --> 42:14.060
As the other three plant themselves firmly into the fluorescent floor below.

42:14.060 --> 42:30.060
Rose Mary, but this time with periods after each letter in Mary, holds on tight to her mechanical steed with 42 horsepower, and her long silver limbs fling her up high into the air,

42:30.060 --> 42:43.060
so high in fact that she seems to click into a new set of gravitational rules, and she falls wheels first onto the ground of the bright cylinder that hangs above this place,

42:43.060 --> 42:54.060
and houses the lumbering Gigantam Bropithecus, and the consistently one-upping itself ATV drives up and away from you.

42:54.060 --> 42:56.060
Holy shit.

42:56.060 --> 42:57.060
Damn.

42:57.060 --> 42:59.060
Holy shit.

42:59.060 --> 43:01.060
So anyway, could we have a catch sometime?

43:05.060 --> 43:14.060
So basically this four-wheeler's heading toward you guys. It's in between you and this imposing building off in the distance that's made out of a shiny black substance,

43:14.060 --> 43:25.060
and suddenly a portal opens up above the four-wheeler. Rose Mary, M-A-R-Y, comes down and lands on the back of the four-wheeler.

43:25.060 --> 43:33.060
One of the four metal tendrils coming out of her neck rips the driver off of the four-wheeler and tosses them behind her,

43:33.060 --> 43:49.060
and then the other three tendrils plant themselves into the ground and fling her and the ATV up into the air so fucking high that they go up inside the toilet paper holder,

43:49.060 --> 44:01.060
cylinder of light that is hanging above you all, and she lands inside of it and starts driving towards this massive lumbering beast that you've seen.

44:01.060 --> 44:02.060
Roll Sanity.

44:06.060 --> 44:07.060
Fail.

44:07.060 --> 44:08.060
Fail.

44:08.060 --> 44:09.060
Fail.

44:09.060 --> 44:17.060
This is a zero slash one, so you guys all lose one sanity as you already knew the ball was inside of Rose Mary,

44:17.060 --> 44:25.060
because two of you watched Marvin Glass fling the ball at her when it took her over before she fired the gun,

44:25.060 --> 44:32.060
and you already knew that these things were capable of, like, insane feats.

44:32.060 --> 44:43.060
However, a couple new things. One, just the sheer fact that this thing anime jumped itself with a four-wheeler up that high is fucking crazy,

44:43.060 --> 44:53.060
and then for Jon, personally, realizing that you can be in your body and use the metal tendrils is a new idea,

44:54.060 --> 45:01.060
which that could be sanity-blasting in and of itself that you could be a Spider-Man villain if you so choose.

45:02.060 --> 45:10.060
If you were to look at the back of Jon's neck, you might see some tendrils, like, just bubbling up beneath the surface in anticipation.

45:12.060 --> 45:13.060
This is dope.

45:13.060 --> 45:15.060
Everybody roll unnatural real quick.

45:18.060 --> 45:19.060
Crit pass.

45:19.060 --> 45:21.060
I crit pass too. I got a 22.

45:21.060 --> 45:22.060
Holy shit.

45:22.060 --> 45:23.060
I got a 55.

45:23.060 --> 45:24.060
And I got a 9.

45:24.060 --> 45:27.060
I bet my roll be the most important one.

45:28.060 --> 45:30.060
I bet you fail.

45:30.060 --> 45:32.060
Hold on, I lost one of my dice.

45:34.060 --> 45:38.060
That happened to me earlier, and I couldn't find it, and now I'm rolling with my second choice dice.

45:38.060 --> 45:41.060
Are you fucking kidding me? I got a 71 on a 70.

45:42.060 --> 45:43.060
Oh, shit.

45:43.060 --> 45:46.060
That other dice was probably a crit success.

45:46.060 --> 45:48.060
I don't know why I did that voice.

45:52.060 --> 46:04.060
Dice truly do tell a story, and oftentimes they follow the history, lore, and plot of what's happened in the campaign leading up to this point, which is always handy.

46:04.060 --> 46:10.060
Yeah, that's because they're controlled by God, who wants us to have a cool game.

46:10.060 --> 46:13.060
Oh, good. I'm glad that you've seen the light.

46:13.060 --> 46:18.060
If you have a lame role-playing group with bad rolls, it's because God doesn't love you.

46:18.060 --> 46:20.060
You just gotta pray harder.

46:21.060 --> 46:24.060
Get them rolls right. Get them rolls right, boy.

46:27.060 --> 46:29.060
Rolls right with God, rolls right with me.

46:29.060 --> 46:32.060
And you guys are standing there.

46:32.060 --> 46:35.060
And you guys are standing there.

46:38.060 --> 46:48.060
Dawn, you don't see fucking anything, but the other three see a bright flash of light right in front of you.

46:48.060 --> 46:52.060
And Thomas, take off your headphones real quick. Justin, same with you.

46:52.060 --> 47:15.060
Clark and Keith see the translucent, spindly hand holding an old, strange-looking camera with a green light lit as it takes a picture of the three of you standing on this luminous land with darkness in the sky behind you.

47:16.060 --> 47:38.060
And the face of Marvin Glass, the orifice with just red lipstick outlining a hole, is only seen for a glint, just a moment in your mind before the bright flash of this camera snaps you back to your current existence.

47:38.060 --> 47:41.060
This thing blipped in for only a moment.

47:41.060 --> 47:42.060
Dope. Holy shit.

47:42.060 --> 47:44.060
Sick. So sick.

47:44.060 --> 47:46.060
Holy shit.

47:46.060 --> 47:50.060
I rub my eyes and I'm like, did anyone else see that?

47:50.060 --> 47:53.060
Clark is also just kind of blinking real hard.

47:53.060 --> 47:59.060
I think I saw it. I saw it was him. Did you see it?

47:59.060 --> 48:01.060
I saw him, too.

48:01.060 --> 48:03.060
Yeah, what are y'all talking about?

48:03.060 --> 48:05.060
You remember seeing that picture, don't you, Clark?

48:05.060 --> 48:08.060
Yeah, and so I guess we just saw him take it?

48:08.060 --> 48:09.060
I think so.

48:09.060 --> 48:10.060
Is that what that was?

48:10.060 --> 48:11.060
I'm sorry, what did y'all see?

48:11.060 --> 48:13.060
It was Marvin.

48:13.060 --> 48:14.060
Taking our picture.

48:14.060 --> 48:15.060
Taking whose picture?

48:15.060 --> 48:17.060
Ours. Here, standing here now.

48:17.060 --> 48:19.060
You've seen a picture of that?

48:19.060 --> 48:21.060
I'm pretty sure.

48:21.060 --> 48:25.060
Yeah, me and Keith were in his office at one point. I don't know if you remember.

48:25.060 --> 48:27.060
A couple days ago.

48:27.060 --> 48:29.060
You were underwater at the time, I believe.

48:29.060 --> 48:32.060
Yeah, no, I'm not allowed to listen to those episodes.

48:32.060 --> 48:38.060
And he had a picture. He'd taken it with the camera with the tubes on it.

48:38.060 --> 48:40.060
And he kept asking us why we were in it.

48:40.060 --> 48:42.060
And at the time, we sure as shit didn't know.

48:42.060 --> 48:46.060
But now we know. I guess it was now.

48:46.060 --> 48:49.060
Back then, he took our picture now, right?

48:49.060 --> 48:53.060
I still couldn't really answer his question if he asked me right now.

48:53.060 --> 48:54.060
Exactly, yeah.

48:54.060 --> 48:56.060
At least I know where we were?

48:56.060 --> 48:59.060
Well, that's a fun little Easter egg, I guess.

48:59.060 --> 49:03.060
Anyway, you think Rosemary's gonna kill that thing?

49:03.060 --> 49:07.060
Real fast, the timing is still all-timey weirdness here.

49:07.060 --> 49:13.060
Because he showed us that picture, and then Rosemary did her shit in the office, and she fired the gun.

49:13.060 --> 49:16.060
And now we see, presumably, that she ended up here.

49:16.060 --> 49:20.060
But he'd already taken the picture when we saw all that.

49:20.060 --> 49:28.060
But just now, we saw that Rosemary came down through a portal, went tearing off into the glowing light up there on the ATV, and then the picture got taken.

49:28.060 --> 49:30.060
So there's something weird still going on with all this.

49:30.060 --> 49:32.060
Oh, there's something weird going on here?

49:38.060 --> 49:45.060
Literally, the second Keith moves into frame and pokes at the little metal tendrils coming out the back of your neck.

49:46.060 --> 49:48.060
I give him an uncle slap.

49:48.060 --> 49:50.060
The pet and uncle slap away.

49:50.060 --> 49:52.060
Ouchie, ouchie.

49:52.060 --> 49:54.060
Don't touch my spine.

49:55.060 --> 50:02.060
This all just reiterates that time doesn't move the same here, which could be to our advantage or disadvantage. I don't know what to make of that.

50:02.060 --> 50:05.060
All things are happening at once, maybe? I don't know.

50:05.060 --> 50:08.060
Well, it could be, but probably not, but maybe.

50:08.060 --> 50:13.060
I turn to fool Keith. Fool Keith, how long have you been here? From your perspective?

50:13.060 --> 50:21.060
It sounds like it was to hang you from your feet for a year. Would you be able to know that it was a year?

50:21.060 --> 50:23.060
Yeah, like if I had a watch or something?

50:23.060 --> 50:25.060
You don't really have day and night cycles here, I guess.

50:25.060 --> 50:29.060
No, it's always bright from the bottom and dark from the top.

50:29.060 --> 50:32.060
How many years would you guess you couldn't guess how many years you've been here?

50:32.060 --> 50:35.060
Like a hundred and forty.

50:35.060 --> 50:38.060
That's a long time. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that.

50:38.060 --> 50:42.060
That means apparently you don't age here either.

50:42.060 --> 50:48.060
Or need food or water, I guess. Was somebody feeding you? Was somebody keeping you alive here?

50:48.060 --> 50:51.060
No, never got hungry. Never got thirsty.

50:51.060 --> 50:58.060
I had thought maybe you had peed and pooped all over yourself hanging upside down, but luckily that probably wasn't an issue.

50:58.060 --> 51:00.060
No pee-pee, no poo-poo.

51:02.060 --> 51:06.060
I want to look up and see what's happening up above us right now.

51:06.060 --> 51:12.060
The all-terrain vehicle is driving toward the Gigantam Rapithecus.

51:12.060 --> 51:16.060
Do they either one seem to be making progress towards each other very much?

51:16.060 --> 51:17.060
Nope.

51:17.060 --> 51:21.060
So, Keith, you said the Circle was keeping that thing up there.

51:21.060 --> 51:23.060
No, that was me.

51:23.060 --> 51:24.060
Sorry.

51:24.060 --> 51:25.060
Was I saying that?

51:25.060 --> 51:29.060
No, Daddy. I just got Clark and Keith confused.

51:29.060 --> 51:31.060
Something weird's happening here.

51:33.060 --> 51:35.060
Yeah, I think you're right. Damn.

51:35.060 --> 51:42.060
Why did the Circle want to keep this thing up there, and what do y'all think Mary might want with it?

51:42.060 --> 51:48.060
The way it was conveyed to me, there's a chance that that's the only thing the Circle of Knowledge has ever wanted, was to keep that thing here.

51:48.060 --> 51:56.060
They seemed to think that it was kind of the Destroyer sort of be-all-end-all. If it got out of here, things would be bad.

51:56.060 --> 52:03.060
And I'm a little fuzzy that there's, I think, the Overseer. I think the Overseer is supposed to do battle with that thing maybe.

52:03.060 --> 52:08.060
He's like the savior that is going to stop that thing once and for all.

52:08.060 --> 52:10.060
Yeah, and you're the Overseer.

52:10.060 --> 52:11.060
Should we boost you up there?

52:12.060 --> 52:13.060
And we're here.

52:13.060 --> 52:20.060
I'm not the Overseer yet though, guys. I don't know anything like old Clark does. Clark old does shit that I can't even dream of doing.

52:20.060 --> 52:22.060
Maybe you become it when you defeat this thing.

52:22.060 --> 52:31.060
Yeah, and I mean if you are the Overseer, eventually it means you are the Overseer now. It's been inside you the whole time.

52:31.060 --> 52:33.060
Like ball was inside John.

52:33.060 --> 52:35.060
But not the whole time, was it?

52:35.060 --> 52:36.060
The whole time.

52:36.060 --> 52:37.060
Yeah, the whole time.

52:37.060 --> 52:39.060
Oh, the whole time.

52:39.060 --> 52:40.060
Mrs. Doubtfire, you guys like that scene?

52:41.060 --> 52:42.060
It's a fun movie.

52:42.060 --> 52:43.060
The whole time?

52:43.060 --> 52:44.060
Anyway.

52:44.060 --> 52:47.060
Or like Harry Potter. Always.

52:47.060 --> 52:53.060
I always cry at that scene. You know that movie is about kids' parents dying. That tears me up every time.

52:53.060 --> 52:54.060
Or like Sandlot.

52:54.060 --> 52:57.060
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

52:57.060 --> 53:00.060
Yeah, that dog. That big funny dog.

53:00.060 --> 53:01.060
Yeah.

53:01.060 --> 53:02.060
He's scary, but ultimately he's a sweetheart.

53:02.060 --> 53:06.060
So Clark, if you were going to fight that thing right now, how would you do it?

53:06.060 --> 53:14.060
I mean, Jon, you remember when we were fighting Anne, I did do a little bit of what seemed like magic.

53:14.060 --> 53:18.060
I was just repeating what I heard though. I don't know if... I can't like create.

53:18.060 --> 53:19.060
I don't think.

53:19.060 --> 53:24.060
What if you can though? What if like that circle was just saying the words you say right now?

53:24.060 --> 53:30.060
I was hoping that when I found my parents' book that I could use that to figure out more stuff. I just...

53:30.060 --> 53:35.060
Just say some bullshit and we'll see if that like giant stumbles or something. I don't know.

53:35.060 --> 53:37.060
Too-doo-hock-a-noo. Try that.

53:37.060 --> 53:39.060
Try too-doo-hock-a-noo.

53:39.060 --> 53:40.060
Don.

53:40.060 --> 53:42.060
Maybe it coming out of your mouth gives it power.

53:42.060 --> 53:50.060
Clark summons up all his gusto that he can and kind of walks away from the group a little bit,

53:50.060 --> 53:55.060
cracks his neck, looks up at the monster up there and with...

53:55.060 --> 54:00.060
And as you walk away from the group, you see that the man who was thrown off the back of the four-wheeler

54:01.060 --> 54:05.060
as the portal opened up above and a man got thrown off the four-wheeler.

54:05.060 --> 54:08.060
He's been walking toward you slowly this entire time.

54:08.060 --> 54:11.060
And he's pretty much up on you at this point.

54:11.060 --> 54:16.060
And so you can keep talking for sure and give it a go.

54:16.060 --> 54:25.060
But just to let you know what you see, which is a slender, muscular man in a black t-shirt.

54:25.060 --> 54:33.060
He's got tribal tattoo sleeves on both arms going down to his hands and fingertips.

54:33.060 --> 54:38.060
Friend is branded across his forehead.

54:38.060 --> 54:40.060
Joe, do not let him distract you.

54:40.060 --> 54:45.060
He knows that if we say too-doo-hock-a-noo right now, the game's over. We win.

54:47.060 --> 54:49.060
Don't get sidetracked.

54:49.060 --> 54:53.060
And he's carrying a huge stick, like a staff.

54:53.060 --> 54:58.060
And the staff is made out of, you guessed it, pure darkness.

54:58.060 --> 55:00.060
I was going to say wood.

55:02.060 --> 55:05.060
Clark nods at him and says, hey, Jermaine.

55:05.060 --> 55:10.060
Too-doo-hock-a-noo! Too-doo-hock-a-noo!

55:10.060 --> 55:13.060
Was it Jermaine? I was looking up which one it was.

55:13.060 --> 55:14.060
It absolutely is Jermaine.

55:14.060 --> 55:15.060
Fuck yeah.

55:15.060 --> 55:18.060
As you start saying too-doo-hock-a-noo, he's like, oh, hey.

55:21.060 --> 55:25.060
Do I roll unnatural for my too-doo-hock-a-noo, or does nothing happen?

55:26.060 --> 55:29.060
You know, we're kind of making it up as we go.

55:30.060 --> 55:34.060
You certainly roll unnatural for your too-doo-hock-a-noo.

55:38.060 --> 55:43.060
This is either narratively great or narratively awful, but it's an 83 on a 63, so I fail.

55:44.060 --> 55:47.060
Wasn't failing an unnatural roll going to be bad?

55:47.060 --> 55:48.060
Yeah.

55:48.060 --> 55:50.060
And it motherfucking is, y'all!

55:50.060 --> 55:55.060
This towering, lumbering beast plotting for it on two legs seems to...

56:00.060 --> 56:07.060
As it realizes that it has been unleashed from the treadmill spell that had been previously put on it,

56:07.060 --> 56:14.060
and it begins, boom, boom, boom, moving faster and faster and closer and closer toward you.

56:14.060 --> 56:20.060
And as it reaches, the ATV is going straight towards it, and the two are about to collide.

56:20.060 --> 56:22.060
Clark is yelling back to the guest, bad idea, bad idea, bad idea!

56:22.060 --> 56:25.060
And he's going to start trying to get toward the building.

56:25.060 --> 56:27.060
Just say it louder.

56:27.060 --> 56:37.060
Rosemary leaps from the back of this all-terrain vehicle and wraps her tendrils around the beast,

56:37.060 --> 56:43.060
creating a sort of saddle on this thing as she rides on the back of his neck

56:43.060 --> 56:52.060
as this gigantic umbropithecus with Rose M-A-R-Y on the back of it leaps from the edge of the cylinder

56:52.060 --> 56:58.060
and lands on the same plane as the five of you.

56:58.060 --> 56:59.060
Oh, fuck.

56:59.060 --> 57:03.060
Jon goes from six to midnight and considers betraying humanity for the first time.

57:06.060 --> 57:07.060
Hell yes.

57:09.060 --> 57:10.060
Fuck me.

57:22.060 --> 57:28.060
I'm on the borderline, leaving my mind at your altar.

57:28.060 --> 57:32.060
Crossing the double line, doing it every time.

57:32.060 --> 57:38.060
Tell me what kind of world are you living in?

57:41.060 --> 57:47.060
What kind of world are you living in?

57:52.060 --> 58:12.060
What kind of world are you living in?

58:12.060 --> 58:21.060
What kind of world are you living in?

58:21.060 --> 58:23.060
What kind of world are you living in?
