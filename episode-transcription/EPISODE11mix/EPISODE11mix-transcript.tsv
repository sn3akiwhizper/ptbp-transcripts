137120	144240	events the three officers went to charles donovan's room at hotel motel now uh wait a
144240	155600	minute do y'all feel that do y'all feel that beat this could only be one thing it's kudzu with no

178640	186640	me and what are the two of you guys doing oh i i had a backup gun right i i got a walkie-talkie
186640	193040	gun and everything back is that correct what gun did you grab because you lost your small powerful
193040	199120	gun i did wait i thought i just had my regular pistol gun my my that's a madman with a noisy
199120	204960	cricket well it's a small extremely powerful that's the one he stole i thought he just stole
204960	211440	like my i would assume that you always had that on you oh see i wasn't assuming that as well as
211440	215520	your police firearm i thought the yeah so you still look for it though like i feel like you'd
215520	220880	go for the surface revolver so he has both of my okay how about this not i don't i thought that
220880	226240	that gun was still in like lock up you can leave it in lock up and he just stole your police side
226240	231440	okay well so then i guess i have that gun on me because it was the only other pistol that i could
231440	236480	get so i have that yeah i didn't think we were fucking with our crazy shit yet more than welcome
236480	244240	well now i have to use it because you know i don't have another police gun if you didn't want to we
244240	252880	probably do but no i want to um okay i'm john and clark what are you guys doing uh i think vigna is
252880	259040	kind of a jinx so i'm standing back is there a window into this place from the outside are we

283520	291600	hey and happy days is playing on the television and there is a
294000	304480	woman on the bed and she is a gaunt woman with like crazy hair and enormous thick glasses that
304480	311120	make her already large eyes look even bigger and she's wearing jeans and a white shirt and a
311120	319120	leather jacket and when you hear fonzie on screen say hey she also goes hey and then looks up
319120	325600	immediately freaked out by you so is this like a greaser professor trelawney professor trelawney
325600	329200	is exactly what i was trying to think of yeah it's a greaser professor trelawney
333760	340960	sans tea leaves so she just is looking at me yep i say don't move officers coming through
342080	351760	i'm trying to be a cool guy cop like the fonz what does she do she's frozen
352960	356080	we need to ask you who are you we have questions for you
356080	358960	you ask her if there's anybody else in the room is there anyone else in the room
361520	371040	speak ah no just you it's just me who do you know here what how are you staying in this room

378160	381120	do you know charles i put my hand on my gun
383360	389680	when you put your hand on your gun she puts her hand under the pillow to the right of her
390400	395680	i said i am a police officer not the tooth fairy get your hand out from under that pillow right now
396640	402240	damn that was a good line vigna thanks i've been proud as he's as he's doing this i'm coming in
402240	412160	behind him gun drawn gun drawn gun drawn uh but still behind keith okay so keith she immediately
412160	417440	just like wings her arm at you she's she's throwing an object at you uh what do you want
417440	421440	to do how do you want to respond to that action can i tell what she's throwing her is it too
421520	425040	quick of a motion uh go ahead and roll alertness for me
428000	435040	nice zero that's the bad one i got a hundred oh then you have no chance of dodging out of the way
435040	445600	so let's see if she passes her athletics role she does yay i'm so excited we thought you were cool
446000	455600	lady uh only rolled a one on damage however so keith you look away for like
455600	465040	half a second and all of a sudden there's a knife sticking in your um arm just like right
465920	471760	just like on your forearm like a how big of a knife it's a it's a small knife about six inches
471760	477120	long and sticking all the like all the way through my arm or what no it actually just
477120	481680	like under the skin yeah it didn't it didn't get in very deep it kind of went in at a weird angle
482240	488320	uh so it didn't mess with any tendons or anything hell yeah uh but you do take one damage okay i did
488320	493920	already i look down at it and i look up at her in the moments between or not between but as soon as
493920	501360	the knife is in his arm sure i've registered as such yeah what is she doing so she immediately
501360	508960	is reaching back under and throws another at clark bishop okay so how are you handling
508960	514720	that situation there's a knife being thrown at you currently i had the gun pulled i want to just fire
514720	520960	okay sounds good can i can i try to uh you can't grab the knife out of the air there's no one in
520960	529680	this town no this is fucking america like i'm gonna get lit the fuck up are you going for a
529680	537760	kill shot or purpose i mean i'm not but it might happen you can try to avoid a kill shot at an at
537760	542800	a penalty you can aim for a specific uh you know like a called shot is that the one yeah it's a
542800	548720	called shot so you would take a negative 20 on your firearms check to do less damage what is
548720	553440	that's what i want to do so my firearms is normally 80 so i'm rolling at a 60 right now correct
553440	563120	i pass crit pass crit pass ones just a single one yeah dude these are new these are different
563120	569440	dice too yep that we have been rolling high yeah they've been rolling shitty yeah oh my god okay
569440	572880	clark where do you want to shoot her in the throwing arm the arm that she was reaching back
572880	578560	under the pillow with that's perfect literally uh as she starts to fling an object you shoot her in
578560	587920	the hand and the knife just drops onto the bed next to her and she is going to uh roll over
587920	593840	off to the left side of the bed and john it is your turn what do you do you heard a uh gunshot
593840	600720	just now uh yeah i just like i slide in on my knees between keith and clark through the door
600800	605440	and i've just got my drunk gone drawn gone got my gun drawn
608240	613760	are you just gonna make us kill everybody like i've set up i've set up characters in specific
613760	619760	locations doing specific things why do they all attack cops this is america like we have to shoot
619760	628800	them you don't have to but you do i mean you can do it however you want however some of these
628800	635440	people are extremely aggressive and have things that they need to do i guess they don't think much
635440	640960	of the contention after i take my shot can i just say i winged her so that you know that i've at
640960	646400	least got her i mean like yeah i slide through the door and i'm like don't you move a fucking muscle
646400	652800	okay cool does she move a muscle she doesn't you can see the top of her head like she's on the far
652800	657040	side of the bed but you can see the top of her head peeking over hands in the air right fucking
657040	662400	now slowly raise your hands she slowly raises her hands in the air is there anything in them
663760	670320	yeah there's a lead pipe in one of her hands drop the pipe fonzie okay
671600	677760	she does not drop the pipe and keith it's your turn i pull the knife out of my hand or out of
677760	681840	my arm try to stab her in the arm with it to make her drop the pipe
681840	688880	so you've got a gun and she's got a pipe but i got a real powerful gun i don't not trying to
689440	696640	unleash this shit yet i'm doing it she i'm she's facing away from us right i would say based on
696640	703280	where you are in the room because i picture you kind of where the tv is and then she is to like
703280	708560	if you walked in the room the bed's on the left tv's right in front of you facing to the left
709280	714560	tv's right in front of you facing to the left and she's on the other side of the bed and you're
714560	719200	standing there so you can kind of see her at a side angle yeah i want to try to like slice at her
719200	724480	hand that's holding the pipe and then like pin her down on the ground okay go ahead and roll melee
726160	736160	i do not pass yeah she crit succeeds so as you swipe with a knife she immediately
736160	743520	like uses your momentum against you and holds the knife to your throat and she's got you hostage
743520	752960	and so it is clark's turn uh help me ma'am ma'am hey whoa hey don't do it uh hey don't do it i'll
752960	759600	fucking kill him uh we uh we're just here uh to ask you questions and you started slinging knives
759600	765440	at us i mean he pulled his gun oh i think he was thinking about pulling his gun because you
765440	771920	weren't talking i don't like him nobody really does uh unfortunately we're partial to him so
771920	778560	i need you to let him go and then can i roll a persuade on just that yeah absolutely i mean
778560	784320	it's gonna be very hard to get her to just let him go but okay sure roll persuade
784320	796000	oh what the fuck awesome i watched it happen with my eyes just rolled an ott one i rolled a one
796000	800320	again how many ones have you rolled i was about to say through this campaign i've done it a bunch
800320	805120	it's and i'm using different dice every time i promise have you done a bunch i have that's the
805120	811200	fourth at least the fourth yeah and two of them have been going back to back that's shots that's
811200	814240	that's the note right there wait what are you trying oh you're persuading i was just trying
814240	823760	to get her to let you go without doing anything else how about this i won't i'm sorry i won't
823760	830960	kill him and i'll let him go if you let me go tell the tell her that's okay tell her that's
830960	837520	okay come on do you know what happens when a one is rolled you're in no position to negotiate i
837520	843040	mean if you want to ari like i i just don't see literally any possible way that she's just going
843040	846800	to be like after hurting a police after like hurting a police officer that she's just going
846800	853120	to let him go and be like yeah have me well but then what does a one get you she's willing to
853120	859120	slice keith's throat currently so makes her stop i would why what but there's no way we're letting
859120	864080	her go sure that makes sense to her though i mean that's easy to do but then we're just fighting her
864160	868720	again but without keith being right there yeah i think this woman would have been dead from the
868720	873600	second she fucking threw a knife in your arm at this point she doesn't seem to have like a firearm
873600	878800	and we are at the entrance to the motel so we could just like let her go and then just i mean
878800	884160	what is she's not gonna escape ma'am uh we're amiable for that can we just ask you a question
884160	891520	or two before you go i will allow that as she motions the two of you into the corner opposite
891520	896240	from the door she's wanting to scoot towards the door with keith all right we got the key
896240	902560	to this place from a guy that we know to be charles do you know charles the tall guy yeah
902560	906320	yeah how do you know we work together
909440	912320	do you know who you're fucking with
912320	923600	no you should probably get more information because you are going to regret this
925360	936000	can you point me in a direction do the words marvin glass mean anything around these parts
936800	946080	now out of character you guys know marvin glass is the mob dude in the city he runs the city
947280	953680	of course i know marvin glass then you know
954640	958960	no no
963200	964080	coughs and cuts
968560	976080	then you know that you probably don't want to be on his bad side right now you're on the
976080	981760	contention pd's bad side you know what i'm fucking tired it's been a long ass day and your buddy
981840	987520	charles got his head blown off by me where the fuck is his radio the radio
987520	990320	sorry the radio that all sounds like you
993280	994480	she's having like a breakdown
998560	1004960	you just want the radio oh no we actually want quite a bit more but god damn you are not being
1004960	1010640	very forthcoming we got guns on you we don't really even like vigna like well that's uh
1011520	1017120	she wants to be in the doorway with vigna and she wants you two to be over by the bathroom in this
1017120	1022640	motel room are you gonna do that i'm not i think i probably am all right so john what are you doing
1022640	1029920	she's got a knife to his throat yeah i don't know man john yeah john like john will scoot
1029920	1034320	but he's pissed that makes sense mostly mostly at vigna
1034320	1042000	first i'm like sweating bullets right now i've i am not confident that she's not gonna still
1042000	1048880	kill me i mean if all you want's the radio it's in the bathroom how does it work i don't know
1048880	1054480	you probably turn it on turn it to the station you want why did you want it i don't know charles
1054480	1058480	brought it back he said don't touch it it's in the bathroom i didn't know it was a big fucking deal
1058480	1065440	why did marvin send you here oh i mean marvin marvin sent us here to find out what happened
1065440	1072720	to his son who's his son well i mean germane glass him and i mean him and alfred came to collect some
1072720	1080400	money from john peters and then you know only alfred came back and he's a blubbering idiot
1080400	1084880	now so what do you mean now he won't shut up about some gun
1084880	1095760	i don't know what gun some uh he i i don't know that he sounded like a lunatic but marvin sent us
1095760	1101040	out here to find it find uh find germane this is hilarious to me because now it's you who has
1101040	1108560	no idea what the fuck you're dealing with if you had any idea how long our day has been the shit
1108560	1114160	we've been through the things we've seen marvin glass you think we give a shit
1114880	1121280	about the crime lord from the city contention is in some real shit right now you're in some
1121280	1126160	real shit too because you had to be banging around with that charles guy i don't know what your man
1126160	1130960	got into sounds like he stumbled into what we're into but this is a lot bigger than some crime
1130960	1136240	bosses so why don't you fucking let keith go and come with us and answer some questions and we
1136240	1142800	might be able to protect you from what that's what we're trying to figure out that radio turned a man
1142800	1150160	into a cat bullshit that gun turned your buddy and alfred into an idiot that makes sense right
1150960	1158960	ma'am uh the gun can do that so can a radio he's uh he's telling you the truth we've seen some shit
1158960	1166240	today and marvin is not even ranking on the list right now do you know billy harrison no charles
1166240	1171280	had him in the trunk of his car i don't know a billy hairs i literally okay you're you want to
1171280	1179760	know the deal i'm good at killing it's what i do and i get brought along to kill if it's necessary
1179760	1185840	i like you're stopping me from watching my happy days and i just want to watch my happy days
1185840	1191840	so i i don't want to get caught up in all this i just want to go back home and
1194240	1199440	where's charl where's charles do you did you arrest him i shot him in the fucking head with
1199440	1205520	a shotgun was he a good killer because he fucking died pretty well oh my god okay so here's what's
1205520	1215280	gonna happen i need everyone to roll dexterity i got a 14 on a 60 i got a 7 on a 65 i got a 73 on
1215280	1222320	a 60 i failed fail and then you guys both succeeded and what were your numbers 14
1222320	1230720	seven okay she rolled a 26 so she gets to go first and then 14 and then keith vigno wait
1230720	1236400	she gets to go first correct she she rolled higher higher under how we always played i know
1237440	1243360	like that i would have known to roll higher oh i'm so sorry i told you it makes it so that if
1243360	1249040	she has a higher pool she can still be you that makes sense yeah that does make sense okay sick
1249040	1255200	so uh she's gonna take the first action she's going to do the classic hostage move where she
1255200	1262480	just pushes the person that she has and then she's gonna she's running yeah so she dips and
1262480	1267760	it is keith next wait the dexterity rolls were like initiative i was thinking that it was our
1267760	1272880	chance of getting away from her normally whoever has the highest dexterity goes first but i thought
1272880	1277840	since it was such a tense moment that we'd add a little roll in there on our dexterity's to uh
1277840	1282240	make it a little bit more playful uh because she has a higher higher dexterity than you guys do
1282240	1291680	so what's her dex 80 oh that's very hot so she pushes keith and then turns around and jumps over
1291680	1297680	the railing keith what do you do i run outside look over the railing and how far away is she
1297680	1303600	she hit the ground and is gonna start running i'm gonna do called shot shooter in the like leg okay
1303600	1310720	uh go ahead and roll at a negative 20 shit fail all right so keith pops off a couple rounds
1310720	1314880	john it is your turn uh yeah i mean i'm running to the balcony i'm shooting at her too
1316240	1326880	62 on a 60 all right and she's going to continue running clark what are you doing i'm running out
1326880	1332720	and taking a shot as well so she is across she's like halfway across the parking lot at this point
1332720	1339040	and is heading to a maroon car in the parking lot roll firearms are you just i'm just shooting
1339040	1350480	at her just shooting trying to hit her all right uh crit pass 66 on an 80. i'm good at shooting
1350480	1355120	boys yeah you're very good at shooting i'm a shooter boy go ahead and roll 2d 10 for me
1355120	1364080	eight intense 18 is zero zero and eight yeah yeah 18 that's 18 so
1366720	1375120	you fire and like i'm thinking probably three shots hit her center mass and she is i mean blood
1375120	1382320	just splatters not only like onto the ground but also uh onto the car that she was like running

1493280	1497760	cool cool so i have her cuffed and then i want to immediately start administering first aid to help

1637280	1644160	old timey radio but like the little half yeah i was picturing it about two feet wide a foot tall
1644160	1650000	and uh it's got a light on it that's shining red oh that's what you call a foot you call five
1650000	1663520	inches yeah it's uh it's uh it's got a uh two two like lights on it and the red and the green

1711760	1715280	oh you sound a lot cooler all of a sudden he started smoking
1715280	1717760	everyone around here kind of sounds like this
1720160	1726960	that uh our our lackey guy what's his name tim or something lauren no it was ray but now it's not
1726960	1732480	oh lauren is the officer who takes care of everything for you guys okay that doesn't
1732480	1738400	sound right lauren i let's get it does though let's get lauren to uh meet the this perp at
1738400	1743680	the hospital and keep an eye on her didn't it start with a d or it was travis right
1743680	1749680	travis or i have no idea what you're talking about it's always been lauren you're pretty sure
1749680	1755040	i do want to send lauren to keep an eye on this perp at the hospital perfect is that l-a-u or
1755040	1764880	l-o-r-e yeah is it lauren lauren lauren it's lauren lauren lauren is it a boy or girl l-a-u-r-e-n
1764880	1767440	she identifies as a woman dope is she hot
1769920	1779760	idiot i'm sorry guys i am just i've had an off day you know an off well an off career so far
1779760	1786240	for future reference if a woman slings a knife at you you're an officer of the law you can shoot
1786240	1791280	her yeah but yeah and if then she then is just like peacefully like you know she surrendered
1791280	1796400	she was still holding a pipe though i don't know why you would close that distance well
1797040	1802320	because i am trying to get the most information i can out of these people i you know at the end
1802320	1808080	of the day it would be great to take down the mob in the city be known for that you know and
1808160	1814160	mob is like an oozy blackness spreading across decent society right we got one of
1814160	1818880	those in contention right now that's an actual oozy blackness spreading across
1818880	1822800	decent life forms you know what i mean like so do you want me to go
1824160	1830800	kill her is that what you're telling me to do i'm kind of confused here i mean i want to be you
1830800	1835440	guys are better cops than i am and i want to be a better cop so if you need me to just go kill her
1835440	1839680	that's going to make me a better cop and didn't just tell me to do it we're not saying kill her
1839680	1845360	now we're saying you probably could have killed her then but she's totally within your or at least
1845360	1850000	winged her i mean but guess what i'm alive and she's alive and we can get information i don't
1850000	1855600	see the downside of this right here she's barely alive let's yeah but barely alive is still
1855600	1861200	technically alive we did seem to come out ahead on this one you are correct okay so the next
1861200	1869200	perp i'll just kill him no well got it if they intend harm upon you keith go ahead and kill him
1869200	1873120	i assume that every criminal wants to intend harm upon a police officer because that's
1873120	1878720	criminals favorite crime right nothing i'm gonna have to maybe read up on this i don't
1879840	1887200	a little a little confused here did you go to the academy yeah in the city i did yeah they taught
1887200	1892000	me they taught me more up there than they taught you what year did you graduate i oh that's never
1892000	1901280	mind that sorry too too personal too personal i forgot years don't exist we don't ask those
1901280	1904880	kind of questions i'm just trying to i'm just trying to figure out that's yeah hr would be on
1904880	1911280	my ass if i knew well i try not to kill anybody but i guess i'll make it more of a make more of
1911280	1917680	an effort to kill then no it's again it's not about merely killing like so make them make them
1917680	1923600	make them suffer maybe just be a little safer okay keith we're not telling you to make people
1923600	1929920	suffer we're not telling you to kill people make them suffer but but do if i have maybe don't let
1929920	1934960	them try to kill you or make you suffer right that's what we're golden rule i'll do some more
1934960	1940240	research on how to act like a proper police officer and we'll get back to you in the meantime
1940240	1945680	keith you ever played a video game do you like video game guy particularly john peters was is
1945680	1950800	that what you're talking about that's probably what i was thinking of but you know when you've
1950800	1957440	when you got your melee class and your ranged class it's generally not advised for the range
1957440	1963920	class to try to close the distance and engage the melee class you know in their wheelhouse that's
1963920	1968080	kind of what happened with that lady in the pipe and you and the knife keith nods his head and
1968080	1975040	acts like he knows what you're talking about all right fellas uh she was talking about a gun that
1975040	1981520	screwed up i think she said alford yeah made him made him an idiot well there was that girl back at
1981520	1986480	mildred mitchell's house who she had a gun she had a gun that she shot at me and then disafucking
1986480	1991840	peered and boy i tell you what i'd be talking about that for a while also hmm maybe we should
1991840	1996080	they said alford did come back though right alford did come yeah alford yeah maybe we should be
1996080	2000960	talking to him trying to find him but changed clark you still have that gun oh it didn't
2000960	2006400	disappear with her for some reason i thought you guys took it i would assume oh that's right yeah
2006400	2010480	i do remember that you know i know it was just the other day but it feels like weeks ago yeah
2010480	2016320	we've got the we've got a camera a radio and again the gun they all have weird tubes coming off of
2016320	2021440	them they've all got red and have we tried to turn the radio on or anything yet oh i would not we have
2021440	2028720	not to do that we're not going to because of the cat man situation true unless you want to you have
2028720	2035440	a dog right i don't want to be a dog well if you want to volunteer to turn that on while your dog
2035440	2040080	is in the room so it's the one that gets well what if it switches with any but anything but if
2040080	2045840	i could switch with you that would be pretty cool for me not for you so much but you know keith i
2045840	2053040	mean in spite of all that we said here you you know i'm a good cop you're not that but you do
2053040	2057440	have an attractive bod i would i would freak you friday with you let's talk about that later
2059120	2064640	going back through my sweet little cop notebook uh there's one more item from that uh shop that
2064640	2069040	is unaccounted for which one uh it was a helmet that was purchased by the first church of
2069040	2074800	contention we haven't been to the church yet have we how about we do that tomorrow yeah yeah we get
2074800	2079920	a good night's rest oh we do that oh dang there's that guy on the there's a guy remember that guy
2079920	2085680	that overpowered you and took your uniform and just vaguely your service firearm and let's go
2085680	2090400	hunt him down what can we what can we do because we don't know what he was driving we don't know
2090400	2094720	if he's on foot we just know what he was wearing he's kind of what he looks like he's got my radio
2094720	2100720	i was thinking we should set up a trap yeah that radio trap we can mention something and just show
2100720	2104480	up there and if it doesn't work then we can go to sleep and try it again tomorrow what do you think
2104480	2108800	could trap him maybe he got on the bad side of charles and he was also snooping around john
2108800	2112960	peters because he's looking into these artifacts as well so if we put it across the radio that we've
2112960	2118080	got the radio and john peters or any of those yeah or that we've got a lead on where the radio is and
2118080	2123040	we're headed there yeah right and then he shows up yeah but then we're there already so what do we
2123040	2127360	say we have a lead on the john peters and the radio because he's he seemed like he was trying
2127360	2133280	to find john not i mean perhaps we don't know that john peters is alive so if he's dead yeah but i
2133280	2137680	don't think that this guy knows whether john is dead or not i think he was looking for him and
2137680	2140960	couldn't find him we don't know what he was looking for at john peters house lots of people
2140960	2144800	been poking around there lots of crazy devices turning people into catmen turning up around
2144800	2149840	there if they think john peters is going to be there it'd be extra incentive well how about we
2149840	2155200	give the description of a man who resembles john peters okay yeah let's do that i like that john
2155200	2161920	peters is a short balding man with large eyes and a tiny nose so that's where do we want to set up
2161920	2166960	this sting operation should we set it up like down the street from the police station let's
2166960	2171520	make it convenient on ourselves at uh what it's on that street well there's the donut hole they
2171520	2177360	could say he's there yeah is that a 24-hour donut hole where is the donut hole that's just something
2177360	2182960	i made up that might be near the police station i was thinking if we for sure yeah oh cops like
2182960	2189680	donuts yeah that's right so yeah that makes sense uh i just mean like if we could set up a place
2189680	2194000	that we have like a van like a security man no i just meant like if there was buildings around
2194000	2198800	wherever we're going that we could get on the rooftop camouflage right next door yeah like get
2198800	2203360	up on the roof he's got some hunting blinds displayed in the parking lot yeah so i'm thinking
2203360	2208480	like the downtown area where the police station is he has like roof access that we could like put
2208480	2215040	one on the roof put somebody in a car or like in a in in like a personal vehicle why don't we just
2215040	2220880	set up a dummy yeah in john peter's clothes in the middle of the parking lot and it looks like
2220880	2226480	he's fiddling with the radio yeah and then we just fucking elmer futhish you know we wait for
2226480	2232080	the bunny to show up not a terrible idea i don't think oh i do but i don't think we should have
2232080	2238880	the radio out there what could go wrong um what do we just like have them go to the be like yeah
2238880	2242960	they're in the donut hole and then just one of us could be sitting in there with like a hood on or
2242960	2247440	something be like describe john peter's wearing a hoodie we have the hoodie on and then one of you
2247440	2252400	guys like across the way on the top of the building and one of you guys or one of us in a
2252400	2258560	car i like it so who wants to be the guy inside you have that sniper rifle do you want to be on
2258560	2262720	the roof sure and then between me he already knows so this really does seem like a situation this guy
2262720	2267600	already knows what i look like that's true being neutralizing instead of killing yeah i think you
2267600	2273200	should be inside but he's he's already assaulted a cop he has his clothes yeah let's play it out
2273200	2278640	though so he comes in let's say do i take him down from inside or do we wait till he gets outside i
2278640	2283520	don't know if anybody should be sniping yeah i think we all just need to get this guy two of us
2283520	2288480	like one of us be in the bathroom or something one guy be sitting there facing away from the window
2288480	2292880	with a hoodie on and then one guy outside and then we all kind of like rush him once he like gets to
2292880	2296000	where you are okay do you want to be in the bathroom or do you want to be in the bathroom
2296000	2299040	do you want to be outside or in the bathroom i kind of got to go to the bathroom okay john in
2299040	2303440	the bathroom i'll be waiting outside in a car and then once he goes inside i'll be closing closing
2303440	2307840	in closing that closing that exit and then i'll just be inside be invading probably just take him
2307840	2312640	down as soon as you see i probably have civvies at the station right oh yeah i'll swing by the
2312640	2317840	station and put on my regular boy clothes yeah i'll put my regular clothes on too that way he
2317840	2322720	doesn't like see a uniformed cop sitting in a car be in the bathroom so i'll just wear my clothes
2322720	2327520	as soon as i see him i'll radio you i guess or maybe just shout you'll hear me shouting for
2327520	2334240	him to freeze let's arrange some kind of signal you have your radio off and then i'll be outside
2334240	2339760	once he goes inside i'll radio you there you go we'll close in on him i like it okay and break
2339760	2344400	what's the plan uh i'm gonna be waiting i'm gonna swing by the station and put on my regular
2344400	2350160	civilian clothes and sit in the donut hole i put on civilian clothes as well i sit in my car
2350160	2357600	across the street from the donut hole and i radio in i've got a description a short balding man
2357600	2363920	big eyes and a kind of small nose matching the description of a wanted person we have reason
2363920	2369200	to believe that he might be dangerous and he's got he's got that that radio that we've been told
2369200	2374320	about that we've been looking for so if we could get uh if we could get somebody down to the donut
2374320	2381120	hole uh yeah it's gonna take me an hour probably to get down there yeah i'm i'm not anywhere close
2381120	2389280	right now uh what about you john i am in the bathroom somewhere else it's gonna be a minute
2389280	2396880	okay well uh if we can have maybe lauren or or drew get down there but uh it's gonna take all
2396880	2402640	three of us a while to get there it seems like so i'm in route either way okay sick so you guys
2402640	2407680	wait i've ordered a coffee and a single glazed donut and i'm maybe reading the paper from
2407680	2412640	yesterday because it's like one in the morning yeah yeah real quick if you guys could all lose
2412640	2421760	one willpower for me i am so excited guys i hope our plan works for absolutely nothing to happen
2423920	2431040	okay so after about 15 minutes a black suv rolls up and parks a block away from the donut hole
2431040	2437840	a very short young woman and a very tall old man get out and they are both wearing a black suit
2437840	2444640	white shirt black tie black sunglasses and an ill-fitting windbreaker that says fbi in big
2444640	2452000	letters across the back clark as you sip on your coffee you hear the door behind you swing open
2452000	2457760	the door chimes jingle and jangle and you hear footsteps out of the corner of your eye you see
2457760	2464080	a short young woman walk across the shop to the counter the other footsteps approach you from
2464080	2476400	behind
2494080	2506400	oh
2514160	2520400	street me down takes me back
