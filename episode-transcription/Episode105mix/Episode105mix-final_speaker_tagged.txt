0.00 207.30 speaker0  Bless this mess, my babies. Damn, y'all are stinky. Uh-oh. It's your scent-spraying stepdad, Wolf the dog. And I'm here stinking up the joint live from 694.2 PTBP, the only radio station that offered smell-o-listen for a time. But we had to stop. People died, man. This episode's Howlin' with Wolf is from at Sergeant Boondock on Twitter. He tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod, which really puts the hell yeah in hell yeah, dude. Mr. Sergeant Boondock would like me to dedicate a big old smooch to Mrs. Sergeant Boondock. Well, I guess I can cook up a little romance. Prepare for a smooch. Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew. Mwah. Sorry, I don't know what came over me, Sergeant Boondock on Twitter. I was overcome with a strong passion. I haven't given an auditory smooch in many a millennia, according to my smooch calendar. If you wanna make a saucy request of your stinky wolf, tag the show at pretending pod on the internet. And if you're interested in trading $6.66 and purchase your own personal Splashylvania Fastpass. As always, the links are all up in the show notes and I am all up in the news. Last time, the little twins recognized and stared down Clark Bishop from a horrifying vessel floating across the shimmering steel sea, aboard this defaced bay boat, the rabid ball holding Julie Maxwell's corpse ripped at the bridge connecting the two stilted bunkers. Keith, Don, and Jack leapt for the railing of the little balcony outside the second bunker's hatch door, but Keith couldn't hold on. He fell into the molten ocean and became engulfed in the sea made of solder. But Don D. Pettymore chanted some sort and each action by person, object, or ball played out perfectly in reverse. As the rope bridge came crashing down a second time, Keith leapt for the railing of the little balcony outside the second bunker's hatch door. But this time, with a little hindsight, to everyone's delight, he held on with all his might. It's Dragon in 3 with What Kind of World Are You Living In.
202.30 297.30 speaker1  ["What Kind of World Are You Living In"] How many apples can you fit in your butt, Thomas? So, Taylor and I started saying ditto a lot. I don't know who started it, but then we were, like, kind of playing with the word and saying different iterations. So, there for a minute it was just, like, ditty, ditty, dits. And now, if we agree with each other, we just go, big dits. Big dits. Big dits. But then...
292.30 329.30 speaker2  with Luke where he sucks our penises and calls them bananas cause he's Diddy Dong? To Luke?
325.30 341.30 speaker1  Right. Well, then the listeners can know that you feel that way.
340.30 366.30 speaker2  Oh, God.
359.30 411.30 speaker1  But that's our new intro, like, thing, is that we say fucked up stuff until Thomas goes, I don't think we can put this in there, and then we start the episode.
407.30 433.30 speaker2  and somehow the reverse, you know, didn't put the sweat back on my hands, and I grab on with all my strength.
432.30 443.30 speaker0  Echoes.
438.30 517.30 speaker2  Can I try to pull myself up this round or, I guess, probably not? It looks like Keith made it this time. This time, I'm saying this time because we went back in time. Did that happen to you, Jon? Oh, hell yeah, I fail. Oh, I failed over my power. It's a 66.
515.30 534.30 speaker1  You can't fool me again. You ain't going to Rorschach me again. All right, so with that, you all lose one sanity. This was a zero slash one, so Clark, you still only lose one.
532.30 549.30 speaker2  I would just start chucking things against walls. I just threw a door. You saw me do that. I'm going to just keep on chucking shit. Where the fuck are we? Get out of here.
546.30 593.30 speaker1  you pick up the golf club you found earlier, and you fling it, and as it leaves your hands, you think you're throwing it at the wall, but it just kind of flips out of control. Putter head over handle flies toward Leo piston, and the putter part just sinks directly into the bullet hole in him, I mean, you're just not even paying attention. You're just throwing shit. Don V. Pettymore, you're up.
590.30 609.30 speaker0  so I need to re-grab onto the thing. Yeah. Okay.
605.30 613.30 speaker1  I'm willing to take that risk.
612.30 618.30 speaker0  Nice. Yep.
615.30 629.30 speaker1  as this rope bridge is crumbling beneath him, and he, not crumbling, just moving, just falling.
627.30 650.30 speaker0  He's like, oh, son of a bitch.
642.30 652.30 speaker1  on this stilted room above the shiny, shimmering silver sea.
650.30 672.30 speaker2  John, it's your turn. Keith, Don, are you okay? no lasting effects at all, and my hands aren't sweaty anymore.
670.30 682.30 speaker1  You didn't feel it mature you at all, like you passed through a crucible,
678.30 719.30 speaker2  I don't know. I'd say maybe I have lost enough sanity and rolled over my power and am at a breaking point, past my breaking point. and crash into the sea. Can I calm him down at all with persuade or... Yeah, if you have psychotherapy, that is what it is meant for,
717.30 725.30 speaker1  then you'd take a negative 20. Okay, I'll try a negative 20 on my persuade,
724.30 755.30 speaker2  Fuck. 59, that would have been excellent. that he's using as a shield, and he's deflecting some incoming shots. Please! I don't like shots.
754.30 759.30 speaker1  Please!
757.30 771.30 speaker2  I guess just don't worry about it, and your life will always be like this now, so why even, you know, don't stress out?
770.30 889.30 speaker1  Fails. Oh, no! Takes his huge pants down. But the shorts make for a huge parachute, The twinkle star in the sky, he just disappears like Team Rocket. and as he makes the jump for it, he hits his head. He, like, grabs on to the railing, but then his head kind of slams into the room, and he immediately just lets go, and he starts falling, and he's falling on his back, and he's kind of, like, rotating backwards, so you think his neck is probably gonna land first. The moment that it reversed all of its actions where they just held lollipops, but then, for some reason, we're forced to put the lollipops back into their overalls.
888.30 912.30 speaker2  taking our candy away from them on top of everything else that had happened. Holy shit.
910.30 994.30 speaker1  However, the reason he doesn't hit the ocean is because one long metal tendril flies out towards him and skewers his neck right in between his head and his shoulders. It goes all the way through, about five yards past him as well, and so as the long, long metal limb is just horizontal above, parallel with the ocean, the body of Jack Russell is, like, hanging from it like a foosball player, but the stake is going through his neck. Because of his, like, rotation as he was falling, he is like a foosball player, kind of spinning around by his neck. The metal tendril rips backwards and brings the body of Jack Russell with it, and so now two of its tendrils are holding up bodies, one being Julie Maxwell, the other Jack Russell, as two of the other tendrils are in the melting, shimmering silver sea. within the waters, made of the same texture but in a different state than itself.
992.30 1018.30 speaker2  Keith is pulling himself up to get up and get on, like, level ground, and as he's saying it, he looks over at Don and is like, thanks, don't use that on him. And with a 12, I pull myself up.
1015.30 1024.30 speaker1  that is outside of this stilted room with the hatch door right next to you.
1022.30 1032.30 speaker2  I think about what just happened to me, and it's not computing.
1030.30 1051.30 speaker1  to take off their headphones. Did he, Don? I'm on top of it. I need you to...
1050.30 1053.30 speaker2  All the... All right.
1052.30 1063.30 speaker1  Hitting them all. All the things. So I need you to roll three times. A D100, right?
1061.30 1071.30 speaker2  A 3. And 80.
1069.30 1090.30 speaker1  irrational compulsion for stealing. an excessive liking for darkness. Okay. And 80 is phasmomania, an obsession with ghosts.
1089.30 1112.30 speaker2  when this happened, and it's, you know, dark and gooey and all the colors and also other stuff, right? Yep. The second one, compulsion for the dark. Yeah, okay.
1110.30 1123.30 speaker1  I like it.
1119.30 1175.30 speaker2  All right, let's get him back. I feel birded. You know that one, classic one. and then I look at Don.
1173.30 1190.30 speaker1  What am I rolling? I crit, succeed.
1189.30 1200.30 speaker2  No. Jesus Christ. Should I try and move? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1196.30 1206.30 speaker1  So you could roll like constitution to tough it out, yeah. Wait, wait, I lied, I lied.
1205.30 1233.30 speaker2  Did you crit fail? I only have a 40, so I crit fail. Should I still roll? Whoa, sneaky.
1229.30 1247.30 speaker1  and a critical fail, huh? Throw him back into the sea. Yeah, he just slips and falls over the railing. Undo everything.
1246.30 1283.30 speaker2  I don't have to die. My parachute pants open up and it slows me down so much that I can't even touch his fingers with my foot.
1280.30 1296.30 speaker1  Oh, Keith Vigna, old wet hands. You like getting his face too.
1295.30 1319.30 speaker2  Screaming right in his face. Clark, your turn. Am I snapped out of it? Yeah. He starts to get his wits about him and he stops throwing things with his much vigor and then slowly stops throwing things at all.
1318.30 1325.30 speaker0  Leo, I'm so sorry. Oh, fuck. Leo, I didn't mean it.
1324.30 1336.30 speaker2  I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. It just happens sometimes. I'm sorry.
1335.30 1338.30 speaker0  I'm sorry.
1337.30 1346.30 speaker2  I didn't mean to do that. Leo, you have to admit it was one hell of a throw. That was one in a million.
1345.30 1353.30 speaker0  Dang it. Dang it.
1348.30 1357.30 speaker1  This hole is so big now you can fit like two apples in here.
1356.30 1362.30 speaker2  Two. Okay, rookie numbers.
1360.30 1366.30 speaker0  It's driving us mad.
1364.30 1381.30 speaker2  We got to – that ball's out there.
1380.30 1419.30 speaker0  I guess not. – Vigna take one step and then tweak his ankle and fall over and start yelling at me? That seems like Don.
1413.30 1427.30 speaker1  No, I think that with how panicked and freaked out Keith is, he's just going to take it.
1425.30 1431.30 speaker0  Let's say both. Thanks for the recommendation, Luke.
1429.30 1447.30 speaker2  Yeah, yeah, anything.
1446.30 1452.30 speaker1  Yeah. Oh, God.
1451.30 1511.30 speaker2  So unfortunate. Snapped out of it? And Jon smacks him twice across the face, grabs him by the shoulders and says, I don't know.
1509.30 1519.30 speaker0  Ouchie, ouchie. Oh, my God.
1517.30 1563.30 speaker2  A petty ball. Jon Lee petty ball. Holy shit.
1552.30 1599.30 speaker1  So, yeah, he's still hanging there and his vocal cords are pushing against the metal tendril that's going through his neck sideways.
1598.30 1608.30 speaker2  Yeah. Yeah, Zach, you ever think of that? Yeah, Zach.
1606.30 1630.30 speaker1  It's definitely Don. It's coming for Don. He's the only one who's like, out of one of the rooms and he's standing above Keith, so Keith wouldn't be a target. So the biggest target is Don D. Pettymore and this thing is flinging a metal tendril at you. What do you do?
1626.30 1655.30 speaker0  Is the hatch near me the door to get into?
1646.30 1679.30 speaker1  and we were staring at the hatch, you would be with Keith holding him just to the left of this hatch and you'd have to reach across this hatch door in order to pull it open, putting the door in between you and the metal tendril flinging toward you but also putting the entrance to this bunker on the other side of the hatch from where you were standing.
1678.30 1706.30 speaker2  Yeah.
1704.30 1709.30 speaker0  What's going on there? What was that? It was gross. He's making kissy faces.
1708.30 1717.30 speaker2  That's weird.
1716.30 1736.30 speaker1  What are you guys talking about? Taylor brought me food. It's not all B's. Wait, really?
1734.30 1738.30 speaker2  They rebooted it with a Z.
1737.30 1747.30 speaker0  It's called Arby.
1746.30 1750.30 speaker1  What about Arby? That's what Thomas said.
1749.30 1770.30 speaker2  We're going to Arby. Yeah, that's what Thomas said. Oh, sorry. Windy.
1769.30 1773.30 speaker0  It's plural.
1772.30 1781.30 speaker2  There are two Arby.
1780.30 1785.30 speaker1  With a 40. Which is lower.
1784.30 1801.30 speaker0  Wait, is that good or bad? I don't know. That's good for you. Yay! Cool. Hell yeah.
1797.30 1857.30 speaker1  You just rip it open and it's blocking you and Keith. You can't see the boat at all anymore. You can't see this metal tendril coming toward you. And then all of a sudden, the hatch door, which is made out of the same black, colorful, inky darkness, warps toward you. Like something is pushing into it from the other side. And it's almost as if a stretched out piece of cotton or a canvas is being pushed by a hand. But it's this metal tendril trying to push and break through this hatch. And it cannot. And it kind of rubbery bounces back. You can't see anything, but you seem to be safe. You feel... There's not a metal tendril inside of you. So you did good.
1856.30 1873.30 speaker2  Hey, Jon.
1858.30 1906.30 speaker1  When he flings open the hatch through the doorway, you do not see the inside of a room like the junkyard bunker that you are in. You see a vast world. The sky is the same inky darkness that is extremely, extremely... Oh, wait. No, it's not. And the ground is made of pure light.
1902.30 1928.30 speaker2  Looks like there's a world of pure light over on the other side. That might be nice, instead of this junkyard fucking dying-ass Leo piston. The cat fucker. It may not be nice, actually.
1926.30 1934.30 speaker0  That's where they were trying to keep it. They were trying to keep it in that place. Well, Don just opened a door.
1933.30 1998.30 speaker2  That's probably not good. I don't think it'd fit through that door, but that's probably not good that that door is open. Shit. I don't know. Maybe it is best if we just stay here with the cat fucker. But we probably should go get Keith. How are we gonna... What are we gonna... And then once I'm like a master, then we go outside and rescue everybody. Can we use that to our advantage here? But in another manner speaking, I don't want to break the game by being super powerful.
1990.30 2006.30 speaker1  I think now is the time to use any resource that you have available in order to not die or not let your friends die.
2005.30 2048.30 speaker2  Yeah. John walks over to the wall and puts his hands on his hips and kind of considers for a moment. And he touches the top and he touches the bottom. And he closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. And I roll unnatural. And he passes with a 37.
2035.30 2075.30 speaker1  Looking through this portal that you've just created, John Lee, Kevin Moore III, and Clark Bishop see a metal tendril pulling back away from this portal. And the view that you're looking through seems to be from the side of the hatch that was just penetrated by this metal tendril. You're like looking out of that hatch somehow. So if you walk through, then you'd be on the other side from Don and Keith.
2073.30 2116.30 speaker2  Right. But it's probably going to hit again, right? You don't know that to be true. Yeah, on the wrong side of the door, though, I think.
2113.30 2121.30 speaker1  You can hear Clark and John having this conversation.
2119.30 2161.30 speaker2  John? Oh, shit. And I'm still laying on the ground?
2159.30 2195.30 speaker1  But it's like out of control. As you open this portal, you see one of these long metal tendrils just flies up through into the portal. It's like trying to, like, get one of you, but it just completely misses as John closes the portal. And this metal tendril just falls in this Leo piston junk bunk yard bunker stilted room. And it wriggles for, like, half a second.
2192.30 2265.30 speaker2  It doesn't, it can't, or, I don't know. Yeah. And it sounded like a spell to Keith. And he knew that Don just cast a spell. So Keith is thinking that he was trying to cast a spell. So Keith starts saying,
2264.30 2291.30 speaker0  Is it solid metal?
2290.30 2351.30 speaker2  You can wait. I'll trigger it to set off right after your turn. I'll skip this turn, wait till the end of your turn, and so the portal will open right before Don's turn in a manner of speaking. so that it'll open up and Don can run through it on his turn and bring Keith with him.
2346.30 2383.30 speaker1  Yeah, if you poke your head around the door, then you would see it's not the whole tendril. Half the tendril is recoiling, and it's losing its mind. Or mind. It's losing its ball. when two of you were on the boat together.
2381.30 2389.30 speaker0  Oh, he said two? Oh my god.
2385.30 2409.30 speaker1  Oh, it's so good that it's just me and you, because we've got two to a canoe here. Two to a canoe.
2406.30 2415.30 speaker0  I'm like, I feel like I'd just be like, now stay close to me, boy. We gotta survive this, and I'll like, is he near me, or were you like, scooting away from me?
2413.30 2423.30 speaker2  You're like, standing over me.
2422.30 2442.30 speaker0  Perfect.
2428.30 2486.30 speaker1  Don, Keith, the two of you see the ball put its long, long limbs into this shining, shimmering, silver sea, and begin moving. It drops the body of Jack Russell onto the boat right behind the little twins, still holding onto the body of Julie Maxwell, but it moves and makes its way toward the John made hole in the side of the original piston bunker yard, and John and Clark, you both see, just rising from below, right outside that John made hole, a one inch in diameter, silver sphere pop up with the tendrils coming out below it and above it. It's made its way to the John made hole.
2484.30 2505.30 speaker2  I stand up. Fuck. I look on the other side of the door to see what could have happened to this spider.
2497.30 2545.30 speaker1  but then you see through the door this entirely new world, the sky completely dark. It's almost tension relieving when you look into it because it is just one thing. When you look into the sky and you look at materials that are in this plane of existence where you are currently, it wrinkles your brain, it like tenses your shoulders. You haven't been able to really relax even though you feel completely content here. There, on the other side, it is just darkness above and just light below.
2538.30 2625.30 speaker2  and trying to not have the ground in my eyesight at all, staring straight up and just walk in. He kicks himself for closing the portal in the first place and hastily tries to make it again. 43. With his experienced hand, he opens the door into the ivory endlessness of the terrain in the other bunker. They see Keith just in front of them walking into it. Jon yells at Clark, Come on, buddy. We got to get fucking through this portal. And kind of assumes, I guess, that the ball will choose Leo instead of Clark.
2623.30 2647.30 speaker1  Do I see, like, Jon coming through? Yeah, when you turn and go around the hatch to your left immediately on the inside of this hatch door, you see Jon dragging Clark through and they pass you as you're standing there. They pass you and walk right behind Keith into this new world.
2642.30 2657.30 speaker0  I think Don just slams the fucking door and turns to go with them. Fuck yeah.
2655.30 2665.30 speaker1  It is Jon's turn right behind you. The inside of this hatch is still a portal to the world that you were just in.
2661.30 2678.30 speaker2  Anybody forget anything? Car keys? Cell phones? Leo! No, no, no, no. No. God damn. I promised him we wouldn't forget him.
2676.30 2686.30 speaker1  You hear a violent cry.
2684.30 2712.30 speaker2  No, it played an important role.
2710.30 2854.30 speaker1  Because you're home, baby. Jon moves his experienced hands across this strange inky doorway, removes the portal, and the hatch dissipates into nothingness as well. The ground you all stand on is made of light. It's a soft glow that illuminates this new world from below. And it's this blacker than black opaque darkness. Dimly lit from below, you can see that it's a slightly shiny pitch black. But Keith doesn't notice that because Keith is staring straight up. And each of you understand why he hasn't stopped staring when you follow his gaze up into a tube of pure light hanging above. The interior wall of this incandescent pipe is made of the same light you currently stand on. And there seems to be only complete darkness beyond its well-lit passage. And there's something in this immense, resplendent cylinder, consistently plodding the glowing terrain, somehow simultaneously moving toward you and staying at a uniform range. It is a towering, lumbering beast, seemingly made of the darkness that surrounds everything in this place. It walks on two massive legs the size of trees. Its broad shoulders swing back and forth high above the glossy ground. And as you all stare, its image seems to form and reform over and over like incomprehensible little glitches. And you cannot fully make sense of its shape. And then it roars. Every muscle in your body stiffens and every breath abandons your lungs. What kind of world are you living in?
