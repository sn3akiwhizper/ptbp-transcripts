00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Welcome one and all to Contentions best radio station that is currently hijacking the radio waves of the city.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And now I am hearing that we are also the city's best radio station as well.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,500
Well would you look at that y'all.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,500
This is your radio pirate ship captain Wolf the dog.

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:28,000
And I'm here to steer all y'all's doubloons so I can buy myself a mini fridge for my new apartment here in the city.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from NZO.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,000
NZO writes,

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hey Mr. Dog, how you doin'?

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I feel like nobody asks you that.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I would like to send a shout out to my lovely second half, Ryanna.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
She really isn't big into tabletop games, but the moment she heard this gem of a show, she was all ears.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And she thinks everyone is doing a terrific job.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Just wanted to tell her thanks for being my number one, even when I can be a real number two.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I guess that's really it.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So I will re-ask my initial question. How you doin'?

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You know, I've been alright, can't complain.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Rent here in the city is a little nuts compared to the old basement back in contention.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But otherwise, everything has been okay, I guess.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I do miss the rats back in the basement sometimes.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Those tasty, delicious little morsels of meat.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Mmmm.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Anyway, as I've been getting settled into my new place here in the city, I have fallen behind on the latest happenings.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So here is an exceptionally intimate version of the news.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The other day, I was walking my dog, Wolf.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And we ran into a little old homeless lady pup getting a nice little snack at a dumpster that I frequent.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Now this little old lady dog took a liking to my dog, Wolf.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And y'all, it looks like my little old boy has fallen for a city girl.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Or it could have been the fact that she was covered in ranch dressin' that was getting my boy all riled up for love.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Who can say?

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Please remember, my friends, we got ourselves a Patreon now.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The link is in the show notes.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And if you can't support us financially, please tell a friend about the show.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And if you don't have any friends, please write a review on iTunes.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And if you can't use iTunes, post about the show on Reddit.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But no matter who you are, turn up the volume and clap on the three and four.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's kudzu with no backbone.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's been a while.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's been a while.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Been a while.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But it has been a while since I've said sorry.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm realizing now.

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You can say it to me now if you want.

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Okay.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Clark.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh, fuck.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I mean, Joe.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
See, I'm already here.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm already ready to go.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Already there.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm already rearing to go, baby.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
In situ.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
We have another special guest with us this week, and it is Taylor.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Hi.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You've met me.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm Taylor.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Taylor, are you having a summer?

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Oh, you know I'm having a summer.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
If you haven't seen that video, go watch Have a Summer by...

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Howard Kramer.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Do he and Kulop still do that one podcast they did?

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He still does it.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I think it's called Who Charted.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah, that's it.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But she's not on it anymore.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Gotcha.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
She got busy.

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
She started writing and producing and all that.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah.

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Taylor, do you have anything to plug this week?

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'd like to plug my career.

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Go be a teacher and mold young minds.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Do the teach.

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's the only way we move forward.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Do you like the smell of pubic hair and having your eyes rolled?

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Wait, what?

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The smell of pubic hair?

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Wait, what?

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Armpit hair.

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
She is currently lifting up her arm and pointing at her armpit.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Your pubic hair.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I can't wait for this to be cut later.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
There's not a chance this will be cut.

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
No, I don't.

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
This is absolutely staying in.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I think there's a rule against me talking about my students' pubic hair.

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah, I was about to say, we might be in legal territory at that point.

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I really like my job.

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Well, at least you've been armpit hair.

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Let's jump.

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I love that.

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You should be a teacher.

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If you like the smell of pubic hair, you should be a teacher.

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And don't we all?

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Take a look deep within yourselves.

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's cool, yeah.

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You could also become a priest.

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
All right, so let's dive into the episode this week.

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Clark.

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
A thick fog obfuscates your vision.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's heavy.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The air, like gravity, is somehow stronger than usual.

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
A whisper in your ear sends shivers down inside your spine.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The voice is familiar.

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
A stainless steel door appears in front of you,

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
opening so near your nose you feel a drop in temperature

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
as the cold metal swings by.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
A woman begins screaming behind you.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And when you turn around, you see the face of Tildi B. Mitchell

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
on a television screen.

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
She begins repeating herself over and over.

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Bonus round, bonus round, bonus, bonus round, bonus round, bonus round.

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And then you are running down the street.

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You recognize this street.

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You live up here on the left.

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
A familiar boy is about to walk into the house.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You begin to scream, and you are surrounded by this thick fog.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Your screams begin to echo infinitely into the sheer endlessness engulfing you.

122
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And then you hear a voice, and you look up, and you see,

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
well, Taylor, why don't you tell us what Clark sees?

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Clark is about to see his one life mentor, a one Gerald Fingerson,

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
in front of him.

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And how is he looking these days?

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Handsome as ever, I say.

128
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Handsome as ever.

129
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Reiterated.

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What's he wearing?

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Well, I wanted that experience to be just between me and Clark.

132
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Gerald and Clark.

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What he's wearing?

134
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Mm-hmm.

135
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay, so the listeners aren't allowed to know?

136
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He's a little bit older, as is Clark.

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But Gerald, he's one who ages so gracefully that it almost looks like he's younger.

138
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He has lost a little bit of his hair, but he's like the most handsome, balding, old librarian you've ever seen.

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Does he still have those tats?

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
He never talked about tats, did he?

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah, he had tats all down his arm.

142
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I think he was wearing a-

143
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Secret tats?

144
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
He was wearing a sweater vest.

145
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
He was wearing a sweater vest with-

146
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Oh, did we make some-

147
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Mm-hmm.

148
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He was wearing a sweater vest with no shirt underneath.

149
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah.

150
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And I foisted upon you that he had tattoos beneath.

151
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Mr. Rogers.

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Anyway, he's looking good.

153
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Mr. Finkerson ain't looking tight.

154
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That's how you speak now?

155
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That's Clark's new character voice.

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Gerald is very disappointed.

157
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And Taylor, on this crisp December morning, Clark Bishop is wearing his underwear.

158
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What kind of underwear does Clark wear?

159
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Tighty-whities.

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah, yeah, non-stop.

161
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And he is also wearing a t-shirt from a gas station called Pump and Dump.

162
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Good.

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Woo-hoo.

164
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Now, Clark, when you look down and see that, you realize that you are also not wearing any shoes or socks.

165
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And it's like December 6th, and it is quite cold outside.

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's strange because you feel absolutely incredible.

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The past few days have been exhausting and non-stop.

168
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But you feel better than you felt in a very long time.

169
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So I'm going to need you to take your hit points and willpower all the way back up to full.

170
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Holy shit.

171
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Which takes you to what?

172
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
My hit points go up to 26.

173
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's my max.

174
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And willpower, you said?

175
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Willpower as well.

176
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That brings me up to 12 is my max.

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Congratulations.

178
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You feel unstoppable.

179
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Woo.

180
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And Clark, around your wrist is a string that's attached to a bag of ice with a metal rod sticking out of the top.

182
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And this bag of ice is leaking red down the driveway the two of you are standing on.

183
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The suburban home this driveway belongs to looks exactly like all the other homes on this street with one key distinction.

184
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The mailbox says Jim Cook.

185
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh shit.

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So you're standing there.

187
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You've got this string around your wrist, bag of ice connected to it.

188
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Bag of ice is leaking red down the driveway, metal rod kind of sticking up out.

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And you notice that there's also like a little, there's something else in the bag of ice.

190
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Where's Mr. Fingersen situated in the world?

191
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
He's just sitting.

192
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He's holding your hand.

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yeah, he's holding your hand.

194
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Mr. Fingersen?

195
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
My dear boy, you look a little different than I saw you last.

196
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Where are we? How'd I get here?

197
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Boy, we've been here for 40 years.

198
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm only 37, Mr. Fingersen.

199
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I know. I like to joke with you, my boy.

200
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I thought that was our little banter.

201
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
We walked here from the park. Don't you remember?

202
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't, Mr. Fingersen.

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What do you remember, my boy?

204
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I remember a room and there were cages and I fought, I fought, I fought, I fought a kid.

205
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And then I saw my partners and they were, they were shooting and fell in the crowd and they were...

206
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And did you save them, boy?

207
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't, I don't know. I don't know.

208
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What do you suppose we shall do now?

209
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I pull the ice bag toward myself. Can I open it without, without losing any contents?

210
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

211
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I peek in. What do I see?

212
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Peeking in, you see this metal rod goes down into the bottom of the ice bag and it is surrounded by ice.

213
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So you just got the top of the rod, just the tip.

214
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Up against like the side of the bag on the inside, up against some ice, there is a small canvas bag.

215
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So is the metal rod just a metal rod? Is there any markings on it or anything?

216
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It doesn't look like it. Go ahead and roll intelligence for me real quick.

217
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Oh boy, it's a roll. It's the first roll in a while.

218
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Now for the listeners, I, I failed to call for rolls quite often in these last two little mini sessions with the other two boys.

219
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And by mini sessions, I mean full episodes as how they turned out. And...

220
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So he's going to give me a lot of rolls with a lot of chances of failure.

221
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Setting Clark up for failure is what I do best.

222
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That one I passed on though. I got a 10 on a 55.

223
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Congratulations, Sue. When you look at this rod, you flash back to being in that cage.

224
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And you recognize this metal rod that's shoved inside this bag of ice is from the cage that you were in.

225
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It was one of the bars that was on the cage.

226
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And I'm, and I'm tied to the bag?

227
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You just have a string around your wrist. It's just, it's not tied to you necessarily,

228
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
but you know, the string at the top of a bag of ice, like a little rope thing.

229
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Got it, got it, got it.

230
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Your hand is just kind of through it.

231
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Like the drawstring?

232
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yeah, exactly.

233
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You said it's dripping red, like presumably blood?

234
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Presumably.

235
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Mr. Fingersen, does this, does this look like blood to you?

236
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
My boy, I've only seen blood once in my life, but it does appear that way.

237
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I lift up my shirt and I'm looking for scars on myself and I'm turning around and it's like,

238
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Mr. Fingersen, is there anything on my back? Am I hurt?

239
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You look amazing.

240
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
As you lift your shirt up, you lift it right above your chest.

241
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You see right, almost in the middle of your chest, but just a little bit off stage left,

242
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
there is a gaping hole that goes all the way through you.

243
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Do you see anything, Mr. Fingersen?

244
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Nothing too out of the ordinary.

245
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Perhaps that donut hole in the middle of you could have be filled in with some cluck.

246
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Go ahead and roll sanity for me real quick.

247
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It hurts right here.

248
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Not so much here, not so much here, but right here.

249
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
A 51 on, you said sanity roll, currently is 26.

250
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That's a failure.

251
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
All right.

252
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yeah, I would say a hole running through your body.

253
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You feel fine, but you're going to take half a D6 of sanity loss on that.

254
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Oh, shit.

255
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You know, because there's a hole through your body.

256
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I rolled a five.

257
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Okay, that's three.

258
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You lose three sanity taking you down to?

259
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
23.

260
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Woo!

261
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
My breaking point is 18.

262
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So as you look at your chest, you see that the skin actually moves from each side of

263
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:07,000
the hole down into your body and creates this gelatinous cartilage walled tunnel that runs

264
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
through you.

265
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And you can actually put your fingers in and as you press in to the skin that is technically

266
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
inside of you, but is not because it's a tunnel.

267
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So it's outside of you still somehow.

268
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It just feels like an ear, you know, or like a nose.

269
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's just that that cartilage kind of hard lumpy.

270
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That skin covering it all?

271
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Skin's covering it all.

272
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Cluck, are you in pain?

273
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It doesn't hurt.

274
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's like my body got a gauge, you know, like in your ears.

275
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yes.

276
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It seems you've become quite a badass.

277
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's pretty cool.

278
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You want to touch it?

279
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Not particularly.

280
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I try to not touch anymore.

281
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That's probably good life advice.

282
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Perhaps we should go inside.

283
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I was actually just on my way to go see my dear friend Jim.

284
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
We have cashew chicken on Sundays together.

285
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Jim.

286
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Jim Cook.

287
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yes, of course.

288
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Why are you here?

289
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Mr. Fingers.

290
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And I don't know why I'm here, but we found out earlier in the week that Jim Jim's dead.

291
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Well, that can't be.

292
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Jim is my dearest friend.

293
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Once you stopped visiting me at the library is the only one I had left.

294
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you, Mr.

295
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Fingers.

296
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But we get it on good authority that he was found dead in an alley.

297
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Okay, well.

298
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
At precisely this moment you notice that there is a man walking swiftly toward you.

299
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And he is wearing one of those full windbreaker outfits that's like purple and green and black and white.

300
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And like straight out of the 80s.

301
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And he is walking quite briskly and he's got these little goggles on that seem to make him more wind resistant.

302
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And as he approaches you he flips the goggles up onto his forehead.

303
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Hey fella.

304
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Hey.

305
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Hey.

306
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Hey fella.

307
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
What can we do you for here?

308
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You seem to be maybe a bit out of place.

309
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What's going on here?

310
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Do I recognize this person at all?

311
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Not even a little bit.

312
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I like your aesthetic.

313
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I certainly do appreciate you saying that sir.

314
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But I'm far more concerned about what you're maybe doing out here on this property.

315
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Oh god.

316
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And he looks down and he sees the red going down the driveway and he's like, what?

317
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Oh god.

318
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
What happened there?

319
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
That's no good.

320
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's a jello experiment is what Mr. Fingerson told me.

321
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Oh a jello.

322
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Who's Mr. Fingerson?

323
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
This year Mr. Fingerson.

324
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Oh that's me young man.

325
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And you are sir?

326
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh I'm Ken.

327
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's good to meet you Ken.

328
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It's good to meet you as well.

329
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And your name was?

330
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Clark Bishop.

331
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Clark Bishop.

332
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And he pulls out his phone and he types and he says Clark Bishop.

333
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Okay that is, you know what?

334
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That is good information.

335
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So basically what we have here is you Clark Bishop not necessarily belonging in this neighborhood.

336
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Would Clark know where Jim's house is?

337
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Jim Cook's house is?

338
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Just from his, are we in contention?

339
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh no you would know that Jim Cook lives in the city.

340
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Gotcha.

341
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Suburbs.

342
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Now sir you will not talk to my son that way.

343
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Now we will be on our way and you can go do some more briskie boys.

344
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
The man Ken, his eyes get real wide and he backs up.

345
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Okay you know what?

346
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I think I better just go then.

347
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I guess have a good day.

348
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Alright okay then.

349
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And he puts his goggles, he flips them right back down onto his eyes and he bails.

350
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
He briskly walks.

351
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
That was exhilarating.

352
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I've never talked to someone so harshly before.

353
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You were on your toes though Mr. Fingers and thanks.

354
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You know I've been doing extra wrist curls recently.

355
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It must have shown in my muscles.

356
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
He was intimidated I'm sure.

357
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yes.

358
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Now I have had a hard time processing what you've said about Jim but you know what I

359
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
always say about a good researcher.

360
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
If you don't see something first hand how could you possibly believe?

361
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Let's go inside.

362
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I think getting off the street either way is a good idea.

363
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Let's see if the door is open.

364
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Mr. Fingerson?

365
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Mr. Fingerson did you just happen upon me here in the driveway?

366
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
How'd you find me?

367
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It seems like me a coincidence.

368
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I don't know why you're here boy.

369
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:45,000
So let's go ahead and as we watch Clark Bishop and Gerald Fingerson walk toward the house

370
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
let's go ahead and talk about the changes in Clark Bishop as a character.

371
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yeah.

372
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So you died.

373
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I died.

374
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I had a great fall.

375
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And you spent 30 luck?

376
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah I spent 30 luck to avoid death.

377
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So how much luck are you at now?

378
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
That puts me at 45 according to my sheet here.

379
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
45 luck.

380
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Alright.

381
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Basically as I explained in the last episode I have given each of these boys two talents

382
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
from the Pulp Cthulhu rulebook and Clark chose...

383
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I chose one of them called Endurance.

384
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Oh yeah so that's a Constitution bump so...

385
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm heartier.

386
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Much heartier at a time such as this and actually how we're going to do that in this game is

387
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm going to give you a plus 40 on your Constitution.

388
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So what was your Constitution before?

389
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
My Constitution was 65.

390
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So now it is 105.

391
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Nice.

392
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So on a Constitution check you will still be able to crit fail on a 100.

393
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Past that it's going to be all successes unless you're disadvantaged in some way.

394
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Super cool.

395
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Super duper cool.

396
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And then you chose another one as well.

397
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I chose Quickdraw which essentially makes it so that I am faster to a fight.

398
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
In jargon it gives me a higher initiative roll.

399
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah so typically I think in Pulp Cthulhu it boosts your initiative roll but here in

400
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Delta Green we don't actually roll initiative unless it seems like a fun thing for me to

401
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
do at the time.

402
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So what we are going to do for Quickdraw is put Clark at the top of the order in every

403
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:34,000
combat scenario and I'm going to let you spend 10 luck to act twice at the top if you would

404
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
like to.

405
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Oh wow.

406
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Now I believe yesterday in world Clark Bishop hit a breaking point and the last breaking

407
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
point that you hit we had discussed Clark Bishop needing to express his anger through

408
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
violence on a daily basis otherwise he would wake up the next day with a reduced amount

409
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
of willpower.

410
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
We are going to go ahead and take that idea and push it to excess.

411
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So what's going to happen is every time you roll a sanity and you fail but that roll would

412
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:12,000
also fail power so if I ask for a sanity roll if you fail that roll but you also fail

413
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
power which what's your power at?

414
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
60.

415
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
60 so if you roll over 60 on a sanity check not only are you going to lose that sanity

416
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
but you're also going to immediately lash out physically.

417
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Ooh that's awesome.

418
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So glad I'm the only one around here.

419
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Yeah and that he said he was going to make me roll a bunch.

420
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Exchange.

421
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Get your things in order Gerald Fingersen.

422
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm always ready.

423
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
For the grave.

424
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
That's rude.

425
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Just cause I'm old doesn't mean I'm near the grave.

426
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm a sprightly 67 now I'm probably like 80.

427
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I think you said you were 19 in the last one.

428
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm funny.

429
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I wrote sanity over 60 equals bad on the side of my character sheet.

430
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
So that's going to be something that I think would be fun if we didn't talk about at the

431
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
table and you just do as a character.

432
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Okay.

433
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I will say like and Joe did that sanity roll also fail on power and if so then I'm not

434
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
going to say okay then I'll take control of your character or anything like that.

435
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'll just do it.

436
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yeah just go for it.

437
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Okay.

438
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And get weird with it.

439
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I love it.

440
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Love it love it.

441
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Do I have to inflict harm or can I lash out in other ways?

442
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I would say lashing out at a being of some sort would be unnecessary.

443
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Okay.

444
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Sorry this sounded maybe like I said unnecessary.

445
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm physically to a being necessary.

446
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Oh he can't just like verbally berate me.

447
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
He has to hit my face.

448
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Yeah that makes sense.

449
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I don't know.

450
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm a librarian.

451
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The power of words is more powerful than the power of fists.

452
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yeah I mean yeah you can think that.

453
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You've been doing those wrist curls though you'll be alright.

454
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You're right.

455
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You're right.

456
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm ready.

457
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Come at me young boy.

458
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Checking the front door of Jim Cook's house Clark feels the knob just open right up and

459
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
the door swings open.

460
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Let's go in my boy.

461
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:15,000
As you walk into this house the house smells kind of old but in a calming familiar way

462
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
and there's an upright piano in the entryway.

463
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
The living room has papers and binders strewn all over the coffee table, couch, chairs,

464
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
the floor.

465
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Really everywhere in the living room there's just papers and binders and papers and binders

466
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
and the sun still low in the sky because it's early morning is shining in through the window

467
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
illuminating a fair amount of stagnant dust that is just hanging there.

468
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I was thinking about a way that we could investigate this house in a fun way and came up with a

469
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:55,000
kind of new idea that we've never done before so I'm going to have Taylor and Joe fill out

470
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,000
a quick form off mic and it's going to be of the mad gab style.

471
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Persuasion.

472
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
What's mad gab again?

473
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Is that the fill in the adjective, the noun?

474
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Yeah.

475
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Okay cool.

476
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Stoked.

477
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
We'll be right back.

478
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Holy shit cool.

479
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Well it seems like Jim's dead.

480
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Would you like to hear me play Mary Had a Little Lamb?

481
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It was his favorite song.

482
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Yeah sure sure sure Mr. Fingers.

483
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Ding dong ding dong ding ding dong.

484
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I make my way toward where I think a bedroom might be and want to find some pants.

485
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You immediately find some pants that are sitting out on the bed.

486
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Are they anywhere close to my size?

487
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Go ahead and roll luck for me.

488
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Uh oh.

489
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
That's a critical fail.

490
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
A 55 on a 45.

491
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Oh.

492
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Geralt hides in the closet.

493
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
What could we put in Clark's...

494
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
No no no.

495
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Not a sainted hero.

496
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Oh right right.

497
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
So Geralt hides in the closet.

498
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Geralt goes home.

499
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Looking at these pants they're actually, they are quite tight as you put them on and as

500
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:23,000
you pull them on they grab onto your leg hairs and pull up and they are basically capris

501
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
on you.

502
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah totally.

503
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So now you are wearing capris, no shoes, no socks, and a shirt from...

504
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Pump and Dump.

505
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
That is correct yes the Pump and Dump.

506
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Yeah I'm looking real swell.

507
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Yeah just nailing it.

508
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So as we said before I wanted to do the investigation of this house very odd and quick moving.

509
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
To basically lay out the information for you and let you do with it what you will.

510
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Basically all of these solo episodes are meant to get the three boys back where they might

511
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
need to be.

512
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
The boys are back in contention.

513
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
The boys are back in contention.

514
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Exactly.

515
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So Clark you begin looking floppily around the house.

516
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And on the fridge you see a picture that catches your attention.

517
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It's a picture of your parents.

518
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
They are posing with silly hats and another man who is begrudgingly smiling.

519
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Have I seen the picture before in my life?

520
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
You've never seen this picture before in your life.

521
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Do I know who that third man is or the third person?

522
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Jim.

523
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
You would recognize him from some of the other pictures you've seen in this house.

524
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It is Jim Cook.

525
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
It's old Jimmy boy.

526
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
In my little notebook I was writing Jimmy boy.

527
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
It's good to take thorough notes.

528
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Serendipitously scouring for more information you see a chest cavity of drawers.

529
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
The cavity was a joke to you.

530
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
You could have just said chest of drawers.

531
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Chest of drawers and open it.

532
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Inside is a ziplock bag containing two small items.

533
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
A single tarot card.

534
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It's the devil with several bullet holes in it.

535
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Wow.

536
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And a taxidermied baby squirrel.

537
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Baby squirrel.

538
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Is there anything with the squirrel?

539
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
There is nothing with the squirrel.

540
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Can I look at the bottom of its base?

541
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Does it have any signature?

542
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Do taxidermists put a signature on their taxidermied?

543
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Of course Zach.

544
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Of course they do Zach.

545
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
You know that Joe is from a long lineage of taxidermists.

546
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Taxidermists.

547
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It's in his blood.

548
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I would say probably not.

549
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But maybe there's one there.

550
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
All of that is in a ziplock bag?

551
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
The tarot card alongside the squirrel?

552
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yeah.

553
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It's a taxidermied baby squirrel.

554
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It's a sandwich size bag.

555
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
So the baby squirrel.

556
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
The squirrel baby is the devil.

557
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Canonically Clark is a fan of taxidermy?

558
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I believe he is.

559
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Can he tell the craftsmanship?

560
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Is it Julie Maxwell's craftsmanship?

561
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Go ahead and roll intelligence for me.

562
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
That is a pass.

563
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Oh shit.

564
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Fuck.

565
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
It's not a pass.

566
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Don't lie.

567
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
It's a 56 on a 55.

568
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
He can't see you.

569
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Never lie to me.

570
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I will know.

571
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I lie to Zach all the time.

572
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's our special little game.

573
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
It's what keeps our marriage healthy is secrets.

574
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
That's a good foundation.

575
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Summer secrets.

576
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Oh you know I'm having a summer.

577
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You cannot tell the origin of this taxidermied squirrel.

578
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
However, as you continue to blindly search for more,

579
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
you look behind the couch and hiding behind there,

580
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
you can see a leather holster for a firearm.

581
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
There isn't a gun, but there is a small bit of text

582
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
tooled into the leather.

583
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Tooled into the leather.

584
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Tooled into the leather.

585
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Tooled into the leather?

586
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Tooled into the leather.

587
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:13,000
It says Scientia Mors Est, which is S-C-I-E-N-T-I-A space M-O-R-S space E-S-T space.

588
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And then underneath it, it has a dash and then the letter uppercase K.

589
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And that's in the leather on the holster.

590
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It is indeed.

591
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,000
And this one really made me happy with the way that the mad gab worked out.

592
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Stupidly going through his bathroom, you find a ring in a pile of abandoned pubic hair.

593
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Thank you Taylor.

594
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
It is smooth and silver with a little plateau on top.

595
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It is completely smooth with no markings on it whatsoever.

596
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
When you say a plateau on top, it's presumably like the base of where something would sit maybe?

597
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It doesn't look like it. It looks like it's just rounded right up to the top

598
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
and then where it would be on the top of your finger, it is just a flat plateau.

599
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Moving throughout the rest of the house, you see that in the living room with all the papers and binders and stuff all over the place,

600
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
you see two notebooks that are sitting out.

601
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,000
One is leather and thick and it has a symbol on the front you have come to recognize.

602
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It has a big circle surrounded by six smaller circles.

603
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
The other notebook is thin and red and it looks familiar.

604
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Oh.

605
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Go ahead and roll Luck for me.

606
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
That's a pass. That's a 35 on a 45.

607
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Alright.

608
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Walking over, you take a look at this thick leather book and it has this girthy wooden bookmark.

609
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Girthy.

610
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Girthy wooden bookmark.

611
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Girthy.

612
00:30:47,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And as you open it, it takes you to nearly the back of the book and written over and over on this ancient parchment is the phrase,

613
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:10,000
it is only through death that he may rise again and death is capitalized and he is capitalized.

614
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Can I flip forward in the book some and see is it all handwritten or is some of it printed?

615
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It's actually weird.

616
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So before you can flip the book at all, drawn over this obsessive scroll,

617
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,000
like drawn over it is a picture of a hooded figure with a brilliant light shining from its maw.

618
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So all the text is in the background and in the foreground is this hooded figure with this big light where its mouth is.

619
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
It's drawn though. It's not an actual light emitting from the book, is it?

620
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It's not, no.

621
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
But as you try to flip the book toward the front, go ahead and roll luck for me.

622
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
That's a critical success. 33 on a 45.

623
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Oh my God. That is incredible.

624
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
All the secrets of the universe are revealed to you in an instant.

625
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
So as you flip this, as you flip this, yeah, I wasn't planning on giving you this.

626
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,000
As you flip the book back through, you see there's a note stuck in it in between these two pages

627
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
and it kind of flits out as you go through the book and the book closes immediately.

628
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
It almost unnaturally, so you can't get to any of the other pages,

629
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:39,000
but this little piece of paper flips out this envelope and inside the envelope is a letter, a handwritten letter.

630
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
You can see very clearly at the bottom it's signed by Jim Cook.

631
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:50,000
In this letter, Jim Cook refutes, quote, the revelation of the overseer,

632
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
calling it the, quote, scratches of a broken man.

633
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
The letter then goes on to outline new guidelines,

634
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,000
including the immediate reassignment of all members of the disposal unit.

635
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
So A is the envelope addressed and B is the, is there a greeting to anybody at the top?

636
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
So at the top of this letter, it actually has the logo, the logo,

637
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
the symbol with the circle surrounded by the six circles and it says,

638
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
faith through knowledge is just called knowledge.

639
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Nice.

640
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I need you to roll luck for me.

641
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
A fail. 75 on a 45.

642
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And with that, you hear the hammer of a gun click.

643
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Oh no. I got my hands up, but still, I guess, carrying the bag with the rod.

644
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Hands up, wearing your capris and your shirt from a gas station,

645
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,000
hands up, holding up this bag of ice that is still dripping faster and faster red,

646
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
just all over this house, just red everywhere.

647
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
We should investigate that.

648
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Yeah, I should look into that bag a little more.

649
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Capri pants, first priority, second priority, blood bag.

650
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Clark, what the fuck are you doing in my daddy's house?

651
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And it is chief Maggie Cook.

652
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Oh my God.

653
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Margaret, do not talk to my adopted son that way.

654
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
He's the only thing in my life.

655
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Maggie, is it you?

656
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Clark is, he might be crying.

657
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
He might have a tear running down his eye right now and his hands are lowering.

658
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Is her gun lowering?

659
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Her gun is lowering as your hands lower.

660
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Gerald is half standing in front of him because he doesn't actually want to die,

661
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
but he wants to show allegiance towards Gerald in this situation.

662
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I mean, I'm sorry, towards Clark in this situation.

663
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Absolutely.

664
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Well, in himself.

665
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Actually, that was an accurate statement both ways.

666
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Maggie, I don't, I'm sorry, chief.

667
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
You can just call me Maggie now.

668
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Clark starts to compose himself a little more, stands up a little straighter,

669
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
but still is so slack-jawed.

670
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Maggie, I thought you died.

671
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I thought you were dead, Maggie.

672
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Yeah, I'm pretty confused here as well.

673
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I start walking toward her and I'm trying to hug her.

674
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Okay.

675
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Gerald continues to like put himself in between the two,

676
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
so he's sort of like shuffle-stepping forward.

677
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,000
She awkwardly walks toward you and engages in one of the more awkward hugs

678
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
that's existed on this show.

679
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Sandwich hug.

680
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And Gerald has never felt so much warmth and love in his life.

681
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
You've got one arm in between us.

682
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
No, I mean, half my frail body is in there, too.

683
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It's the size of one arm, though.

684
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I pull away from the embrace.

685
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Maggie, I swear to God, Joe doesn't remember.

686
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Did I see her body?

687
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Did I ever see her body?

688
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Maybe you would have seen the charred remains.

689
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Let's say I did.

690
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Maggie, I saw your body.

691
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
You were dead, and saying that out loud freaks Clark out a little bit,

692
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
so he recoils and gets a little further away from her.

693
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
This is just like an Edgar Allen Poe poem.

694
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Chief Maggie Cook.

695
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Well, just Maggie Cook.

696
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
She's not wearing her uniform,

697
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
and this is maybe the first time you've seen her not in uniform in years.

698
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Yeah.

699
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
And now you only saw, I mean, you saw her five days ago.

700
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
You were celebrating her birthday, but since then you've already mourned her.

701
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
But she's just wearing like black jeans and a hoodie,

702
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
and she kind of walks toward you and walks kind of past you a little bit

703
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
and grabs the red notebook that was sitting out.

704
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
She kind of thumps it on one of her hands.

705
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Clark, have you been looking around here?

706
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
What did you come here for?

707
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Do I remember what color Drew gave her?

708
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Drew gave her a yellow one, I believe.

709
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Maggie, I'll be honest.

710
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I'm missing, I've got some gaps.

711
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I actually don't know how I ended up here at this moment.

712
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Mm-hmm.

713
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Mm-hmm.

714
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And she pulls her finger out, and she kind of reaches towards you,

715
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
and she pokes at your chest and feels it give.

716
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Hmm, what happened there?

717
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I don't, I don't, I don't know, Maggie.

718
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I lift up my shirt and show her.

719
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
She steps back.

720
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Okay.

721
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
All right.

722
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Clark, I've been waiting a long time for this.

723
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I've been waiting a real long time for this.

724
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
You need to come with me immediately.

725
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
What's her demeanor?

726
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Excited.

727
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Happy or afraid?

728
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Both.

729
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Has she acknowledged Mr. Fingersen at all?

730
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
No.

731
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Which I find very rude.

732
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Uh, fuck.

733
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Where, uh, okay, where is she motioning toward?

734
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Like, when she said come with me?

735
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Was she walking out of the house or somewhere else into the house?

736
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
No, she was just standing.

737
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Uh, Maggie, uh, I mean, where, where do you, where have you been, Maggie?

738
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Clark.

739
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Clark.

740
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Now wait just one second.

741
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
You won't tell us what to do.

742
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Clark, what should we do?

743
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Clark, is everything okay?

744
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Oh, shit.

745
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
You know Maggie always was a bitch.

746
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
She's ignoring me right now.

747
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Don't listen to her.

748
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Mr. Fingersen.

749
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Yes?

750
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Stop for a second.

751
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Clark.

752
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I don't know about this, Maggie.

753
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I don't trust her.

754
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Listen to me.

755
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I point at Mr. Fingersen.

756
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I'm talking to Mr. Fingersen, Maggie.

757
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And she takes a couple more steps back.

758
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Okay, Clark.

759
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I think she's ignoring me just because one time I charged her extra for a late book.

760
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
She wouldn't acknowledge that she didn't turn back in because of Winn-Dixie.

761
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I am staring very scared at Mr. Fingersen right now, and I turn back to Maggie.

762
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Clark.

763
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Yeah, Maggie.

764
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
He knows what's at the mill.

765
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You keep looking at Geralt every time he's talking, and she keeps saying, what, what

766
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
in the world do you keep looking over there for?

767
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And she's looking over there too and just in bewilderment, and she's very confused.

768
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Clark, don't you remember all our good times together at the library when I tried to teach

769
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
you how to read at a first grade level?

770
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I start walking toward Mr. Fingersen, and I hold out my hand.

771
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Can I touch him?

772
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,000
As you walk toward Mr. Fingersen, I think he probably backs up, and then you continue.

773
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
You have that dead wrong narrator.

774
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I want nothing more than to hold hands with Clark.

775
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:47,000
As Geralt Fingersen holds out his hand to grab yours, you reach out and grasp onto nothing.

776
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Fuck.

777
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Clark.

778
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Clark has freaked the fuck out.

779
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I need you to roll sanity.

780
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
My sweet baby boy.

781
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Stay with me.

782
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Hold on.

783
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I pass.

784
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
An 18 on a 23.

785
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And with that, Geralt Fingersen dissipates.

786
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Oh, shit.

787
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I think that freaks Clark out in and of itself too, that he's now lost the thing that was

788
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
kind of helping him at this moment.

789
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
What about cashew chicken sundae?

790
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Okay, I'm done.

791
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
What about cashew chicken sundae?

792
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Yeah.

793
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
As he floats, he just turns into dust.

794
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Actually, no, as Mr. Fingersen is disappearing, Clark is going, no, no, no, no.

795
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And he's gone.

796
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Clark, are you with me?

797
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Are you here?

798
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I turn very solemnly to Maggie.

799
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Yeah, I'm here.

800
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I'm here.

801
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
All right.

802
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Get your head straight.

803
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
We got a lot of work to do.

804
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Maggie, I'm leaking pretty bad here.

805
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I'm going to get some ice and fill up this bag just to be safe.

806
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Yeah, okay.

807
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
What's in there?

808
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I don't know exactly, but it looks like blood coming out of it.

809
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
If there's ice around it, I assume they were trying to preserve it in some way.

810
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Frankly, I'm afraid that it's the hole in me, Maggie.

811
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Oh my God.

812
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Oh my.

813
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And she begins to move some of the ice around.

814
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
She wants to see what's in there.

815
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I let her.

816
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Okay, so she starts moving the ice back away and moving down around this metal rod that's

817
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
in there.

818
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
It's a hollow metal rod that's in there.

819
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,000
She moves enough ice out of the way that you both look down and you see a heart.

820
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Yeah, I was afraid of that.

821
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
That has been impaled by this rod straight through the heart.

822
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And when she sees that, she goes, that explains quite a bit.

823
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
She goes, all right, we're on a time crunch.

824
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I'll be in the car.

825
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I go to the freezer and I crack all the ice trays that I can.

826
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
He's probably only got a couple.

827
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
He's just got two.

828
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
He's a normal American.

829
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
He's got two ice trays.

830
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I throw those in the bag.

831
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I crack them up and dump them in the bag.

832
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Okay, so you go outside and Maggie Cook's car is out there.

833
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
What would Maggie Cook be driving now?

834
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I'm nervous that we've said before what she drives off duty.

835
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I think we said a Bronco maybe.

836
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I think she had a truck, but that truck is still wherever it would have been.

837
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
She's in new wheels now.

838
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:19,000
So I'm going to put her in a silver Camry, just a real common car.

839
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And as you guys are driving out of the suburbs of the city

840
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
and what you would know as toward the mill outside on the other side of the city,

841
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
you guys are in the car just sitting in complete silence.

842
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Clark wants to look in the little canvas bag that's inside the ice bag.

843
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I guess next to my heart, next to a heart that I think is my heart.

844
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Next to a heart that you could reasonably.

845
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Hey, that looks like my heart.

846
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I recognize this heart. It's familiar.

847
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I feel like it's been inside me.

848
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,000
When you grab this canvas bag that is cold and wet and it's got a little blood on it, this is it.

849
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Oh, he just handed me a small canvas bag in real life. Oh my God.

850
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I'm opening it.

851
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:13,000
It looks like little tiny puzzle pieces maybe, little pieces of cardboard.

852
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Little pieces. Oh, there's letters on the backs.

853
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Okay. It's going to spell a word, I believe.

854
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I guess I can just tell you as I see them, S-T-L-E-N-R and a symbol.

855
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
The symbol is a square with a circle in the square.

856
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
It's a stlearner.

857
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I figured it out, Zach. It's stlearner.

858
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
You get a hundred luck. You nailed it.

859
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Yeah, in the car you pull this bag out and you look at what's inside and it is these cut pieces of this material

860
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,000
with a coloration on one side and letters on the other with a symbol.

861
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Joe knows what these are and I think Clark does too.

862
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Hit me with it.

863
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
They're the letters they give you in the final round of Wheel of Fortune.

864
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
It's missing the I though and the I might be the symbol.

865
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Are you sure about that, Joe?

866
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Clark is making that too. Clark is like, these are those letters that they always give you at the end of Wheel of Fortune.

867
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I'm going to give you ten luck for getting that so fast.

868
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Fuck yeah.

869
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
So what's that put your luck up to?

870
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I got 55.

871
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
And you guys are in the car just sitting in complete silence.

872
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Maggie, can you tell me why are you alive?

873
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I saw you were kind of standing by my dad's old book.

874
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Yeah, that leather book.

875
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:56,000
It's got some real importance for me and people like me and soon to be people like you.

876
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
There's a prophecy in there, Clark.

877
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,000
And that prophecy is the revelation of the overseer.

878
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And what it says is that it is only through death that he may rise again.

879
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:25,000
We believe the overseer is coming and he's going to set an order in the world and I've been preparing his way.

880
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
That's what we do at the Circle of Knowledge.

881
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Well, not only that, we're also fighting on the forefront to keep this world safe from the unnatural that's on the other side.

882
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:47,000
And Clark, I was against it at first and she kind of breaks a little bit and she's much more comfortable now talking with you.

883
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:55,000
And she's like, I didn't I didn't believe in the way things were going and I didn't understand.

884
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
But now I'm I'm starting to understand a little bit more about how the world works.

885
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
You know, it's fire that keeps this world going.

886
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
You know, it's it's fear. People can't handle that knowledge, Clark.

887
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Most people. But you can. I can. We can. People like us. People in the Circle of Knowledge.

888
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:25,000
And we've been tasked with this responsibility and it's a big one. We keep the world moving.

889
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,000
What was your question?

890
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I'm at Leon. I'm at Leon Simpson.

891
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Yeah, that's right. Leon's a cool guy.

892
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Maggie, we've been dealing with some stuff for the last five days or so.

893
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
And it sounds like the crazy knowledge, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

894
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
You were just spouting out at me and you were not there.

895
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I couldn't be there, Clark, but I knew that you guys could handle it.

896
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
We couldn't, Maggie. We couldn't handle it.

897
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Well, where are we at?

898
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I just want to know why you weren't around.

899
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Clark, does the ant question when it is being moved by a boot?

900
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
The things that you have been dealing with, they may seem large.

901
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I guarantee you, you haven't seen anything yet.

902
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,000
After driving about 10 miles past the city, you take the country road that leads out to the mill.

903
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Trees on either side of the road have grown to meet above, making a verdant tunnel that encases you.

904
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:36,000
A few miles down this road you see a small sign next to a gravel path that leads into the thick woods.

905
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
The sign says, the mill, on our grind and crushing it.

906
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:48,000
That gravel path leads to an opening where just enough trees have been removed to open up space for a parking lot

907
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:56,000
and a massive brick building with two enormous smokestacks reaching up into the canopy of trees encircling this property.

908
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
It makes you feel small.

909
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
The trees must be at least 12 stories tall.

910
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And you pull into the mill.

911
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Oh, shit.

912
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:12,000
And you guys park and she walks you into the mill and you go through a couple doors, corridors.

913
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
There's people all over the place working. They're not paying any attention to you whatsoever.

914
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Even though I'm stylin'.

915
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Even though you look...

916
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Oh, you are such a wreck!

917
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Do you still have this bag of ice?

918
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Yeah, totally.

919
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
You're just carrying it with you.

920
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
As far as I'm concerned, that's my heart in that bag. I'm not gonna let it out of my sight.

921
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Yeah, absolutely. That makes sense.

922
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:43,000
So even though you look like a fucking lunatic, no one pays you any mind as you follow Maggie Cook.

923
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Real fast, has Clark ever been to the mill in his life?

924
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
No.

925
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Other than what's happened in the last few days?

926
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
And then also, do I recognize anybody in the halls? Is there any familiar faces?

927
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
You recognize no one in the halls.

928
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,000
As you're going through these halls, you go through doorway after doorway that leads you to stairs and then other stairs.

929
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And then finally, this one corridor of stairs that's blocked off.

930
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,000
She walks up to it and there's a scanner on one side of the door and she clicks a button.

931
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,000
And this little thing pops up and she sticks her armpit over it.

932
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
And then it beeps and it goes back into the wall and the door opens.

933
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
And you guys walk down these stairs.

934
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Did that take your temperature, Maggie? Is that what that was? That's how you take a kid's temperature.

935
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Oh yeah, no. You get into all these doors with your pubic hair.

936
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Oh, of course. That makes sense. That's how you do it.

937
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So you walk down and at this point, when the door opens, everything on the other side is completely different building structure than what you've been walking through before.

938
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Everything past here is cold stone and it is a spiral staircase that leads down, down, down.

939
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,000
And it is quite dark, but you are led by a flickering light that is coming from the bottom.

940
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,000
And when you make it down to the bottom of the stairs, you are standing in a room that you have been in before.

941
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:19,000
And it is this circular domed room that is concrete all the way through.

942
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And these familiar slabs are set up where there's one in the middle and there's six surrounding it.

943
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
As you walk in there, there are already two bodies on each slab.

944
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:48,000
And attached to each of these bodies is a xenonema toad, which is one of those crazy looking, just like this oily, squamous material that is actually this creature that you've seen the mouth of before.

945
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
And you've seen the razor sharp teeth with the teeth inside of it.

946
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
How are they attached to the bodies? Everybody has a different place?

947
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Everybody has it in a different place and all of these people, they are covered in open sores from other placements.

948
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And their skin is rotting and gross looking. Are any of them conscious? No one is conscious. Everyone's eyes are closed.

949
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Maggie walks you into this room.

950
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Alright, Clark. Well, this is the fun part.

951
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:27,000
To get inducted into the circle of knowledge, I'm going to need you to have a quick lie down on this table here.

952
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,000
And she points to the slab in the middle of the circle.

953
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Whoa. Leon said he wasn't going to make me have to put one of those things. He said I didn't have to sacrifice flesh or limb.

954
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Well, you're not going to have to sacrifice limb and you're only going to have to sacrifice a little flesh.

955
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
But the game has changed, Clark. And you're being inducted.

956
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Real fast, does Clark, can Clark do a comparison between now and the last time he was here?

957
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Is it the same number of people roughly in the room? Is it more or less?

958
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I think it's the same number. I could be wrong. I think it's the exact same number.

959
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:05,000
The only difference is that the other two people, Leon Simpson and the woman who was here last time,

960
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:11,000
neither one of them are in this room. Leon! Leon! I sent them out.

961
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Leon said I wasn't going to have to do this. Those things freak me out, Maggie.

962
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:22,000
She grabs your shoulders. Clark, faith through knowledge is just called knowledge.

963
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I don't need you to have faith. I need you to have knowledge.

964
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:33,000
And she slowly kind of pushes your chest. I let it happen.

965
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And then she moves down to your left foot. You haven't gotten shoes or socks yet, so she doesn't have to take off anything.

966
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:48,000
And she walks over to the side of the slab and there's this handle in the ground.

967
00:52:48,000 --> 00:53:00,000
And she reaches down and she twists this circular handle, pulls up this big cartridge the size of a...what the fuck?

968
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,000
A parking pylon. Is it that big? Yep. Yep. A parking pylon.

969
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Inside you see one of these creatures. And she, in one swift motion, pulls out the xenonimatode and attaches it to the bottom of your left foot.

970
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And you feel it bite in and your vision immediately goes dark.

971
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Ooh, boy. What's about to fucking happen?

972
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:40,000
The ground you're standing on is made of light. It is a soft glow that illuminates this new world from below.

973
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:53,000
You feel strange, content, satiated in every physical way. It is extremely relaxing, but also weirdly involuntary.

974
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Above you is only darkness. In every direction surrounding you, where what could be called the sky meets what could be called the ground,

975
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:13,000
is blacker than black opaque darkness, except for the 12 figures in the distance and the giant black mass.

976
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:22,000
They are all dimly lit from below. You would think they would cast a shadow on the sky above if it was anything more than all-consuming darkness.

977
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:29,000
These 12 figures seem to be following some massive being as they travel away from you.

978
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:38,000
As you move closer, you hear the chanting. It's soft at first and muffled, but these 12 figures are chanting from deep in their lungs.

979
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And ahead of them, seemingly made from the darkness that surrounds everything in this place, is a towering, lumbering beast.

980
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:56,000
It walks on two massive legs the size of trees. Its broad shoulders are at least 25 feet from the ground.

981
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:04,000
As you stare, its image seems to form and reform over and over like incomprehensible little glitches.

982
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And then it roars. Every muscle in your body tenses up at the same time. All air leaves your lungs.

983
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And you begin weeping uncontrollably before you can even hit the ground.

984
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Your eyes open and you come to and you are laying on this table. Maggie Cook is putting this horrible creature back into the ground next to you.

985
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
And she looks up at you and she says,

986
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Clark, that thing's coming.

987
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
And we keep it from coming here.

988
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
What was that, Maggie? What was it?

989
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I need you to roll sanity.

990
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,000
The chanting, was it discernible? Was it words? Okay.

991
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Would you have me roll sanity?

992
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Yes, sir.

993
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Fail. It's a 37 on a 23.

994
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Oof. Okay. So I'm going to have you half a D6 again for that pretty horrifying and astounding situation that you've just been through.

995
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Half a 3.

996
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Alright.

997
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Make it a 2.

998
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Yes, sir. How many did you have?

999
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I had 23.

1000
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Alright. Down to 21. What's your breaking point?

1001
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
18.

1002
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And you didn't roll above your power, did you?

1003
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
No.

1004
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I got a 60 power. I'll be alright for a while, I think.

1005
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I say that it's just a matter of a single roll that makes it not...

1006
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Yeah, it's a 40% chance that you freaked out on somebody.

1007
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Oh my God, if that had just happened just now, Al, that actually would have been cool.

1008
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
That would have been tight.

1009
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I'm going to do it anyway. I punch a pumpkin.

1010
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Maggie, is there anything you can do about this? And I hold up the bag with my heart in it.

1011
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,000
She reaches and grabs the rod and she pulls it out of the bag.

1012
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1013
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
If you're Clark, trust me here, you're alive without it. Let me look at it.

1014
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Okay.

1015
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,000
She grabs the rod. She pulls slowly. She goes, I know, I know.

1016
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:18,000
She lifts it up and then she grabs your heart with one hand and she removes it from the rod like a shish kebab.

1017
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
And it starts sputtering blood.

1018
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Oh, Maggie, Maggie.

1019
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
And it's going all over the place.

1020
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I'm trying to get my hand over her hand to stop that sputtering.

1021
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And it's sputtering through your fingers like you've plugged a hose or something.

1022
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Do I have any physical sensation when doing that?

1023
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
None at all.

1024
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Okay, cool.

1025
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
None at all. She goes, you're fine. You're fine. Look at you. You're staying. You're fine. Alright?

1026
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Now, I want you to see something.

1027
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:48,000
She grabs a small stick from a box in the corner of the room.

1028
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:56,000
She comes back and she slowly puts it into the hollow metal rod and she begins pushing it all the way through.

1029
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And then she cups her hand at the end of the other side and through pops two little pieces of metal.

1030
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,000
You remember our backup plan for if you didn't come back and finish your last job?

1031
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
You didn't come back in time.

1032
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Oh.

1033
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I've tried to take your heart already, Clark. I think you're going to be fine.

1034
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I don't have a heart, Maggie. What?

1035
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Clark, a lot of things in this world move a lot stranger than we thought they might have.

1036
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Yeah. I mean, yeah. I'm seeing that now. That's for sure.

1037
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Clark, you're one of us now. And I hate to do this to you right away, but I've got a job for you.

1038
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
You asked where Leon was. He's on a job. I'm going to send you out on one as well.

1039
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
What does that mean, Maggie?

1040
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I have a lot of responsibility, Clark. I have my eyes on a lot of pies. Alright?

1041
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I send you out. You complete the job. You come back. Most of the time, that's all you need to know. Okay?

1042
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Now, I got kind of a rough one for you right off the top.

1043
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:08,000
But where it's taking place, you are already supposed to be.

1044
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I need you to go to the funeral today. It starts in, she holds up her watch, starts in an hour.

1045
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:22,000
It's at the city cemetery. I heard about, you know, Ari dying in the fire.

1046
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I was pretty shook up about that. But this does give us quite the opportunity.

1047
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:36,000
You see her dad, Stan Manstein, he's going to be out of the city asylum for the first time in a long time.

1048
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:45,000
He doesn't go out much. And we need to take this opportunity. Clark, I need you to take him out.

1049
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:53,000
You want me to kill Ari's dad at Ari's fucking funeral?

1050
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,000
It's actually more of an assassination attempt, but yeah.

1051
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Okay. Okay, Maggie. That thing I just saw in that vision, whatever the fuck it was,

1052
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
scares me more than anything that I've ever experienced in my life before.

1053
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:19,000
If you're telling me, if you're telling me killing Ari's dad is going to stop that thing, fuck it. Sure.

1054
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Hand me a gun.

1055
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
How are you doing?
