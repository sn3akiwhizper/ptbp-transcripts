273.28 278.28 speaker2  You were over. By how much? Like four seconds.
277.28 280.68 speaker1  Were you rushing? Or were you dragging?
279.08 345.28 speaker2  I was dragging. you all made an alertness check. I mean, so much happened. Oh, my gosh. Really the most we've ever... The most land covered? If you guys were on Find My iPhone and you were tracking each and every one of you, Oh, no. Yeah, I couldn't pinpoint it. It's not going to pinpoint that closely. We went upstairs. Yeah, we could be in the exact same dot location, just one story above. Find My iPhone can't tell you that. Maybe it can. We really don't. We're from Springfield, Missouri if you're listening to this and you haven't heard us before.
343.68 348.88 speaker3  I've never used it on a second floor.
347.68 352.28 speaker2  to find Taylor's phone.
350.88 356.08 speaker3  Nope. There you go.
354.08 357.88 speaker2  How many stories is the Hammond's Tower? 16?
356.88 362.08 speaker3  Yeah, 69.
359.48 365.88 speaker2  That's where I grew up. Go there. Doc Zach in the past. Go there right now.
365.08 369.88 speaker3  Past docs.
368.88 377.28 speaker2  Because people will go there. It probably could be used for an interview.
376.68 396.88 speaker3  Right. All right, let's bail, bail, bail, bail. And it's raining. but all we heard was rain. I know. And I said, yeah. Which means it was an opposed roll. Oh, interesting. I wonder who we were opposing.
394.88 407.08 speaker2  at the end of this scenario.
405.28 424.28 speaker3  Because it killed that gas station attendant. In full view of that witness who thought they heard something, So yeah, good meta gaming Joe.
422.08 495.08 speaker2  I hadn't put that together. Roll sanity, Luke. Just for Luke. I fail. Luke's eyes just got so big. Yeah, he hit a breaking point. We'll see. GPS wise. If it was called Nikotine. As you guys have been reading through the phone of Arvin twice. Once the day after the McCarty murders and once the day of the Quentin Harris murder, but previous to that gas
493.88 517.98 speaker3  Okay, I look out the window. Is it raining? I don't think I should do the talking. Yeah.
517.78 529.28 speaker2  to it. I have to pee Elwood.
528.18 530.48 speaker3  Somebody needs to check the bathroom.
529.78 540.08 speaker2  I got a pee. Is it really bad? Scale of one to ten.
539.08 545.08 speaker3  So you can't hold it. He's hopping around and it's like making the whole house. Oh, you look like you're about to pop.
544.68 553.18 speaker1  Go.
552.58 575.18 speaker3  Ought one. I get it right in the toilet. He feels he feels like a spring in his step. Maybe like he's got an extra awareness or something about
570.38 582.28 speaker2  it. Plus twenty to any role that you would like during this episode because of how well I just pissed incredible.
579.38 591.28 speaker3  I wash my hands, but you have to tell me before you roll that you want to use your plus twenty.
590.28 600.88 speaker2  going to leave it be?
599.88 609.58 speaker3  It dazed you. Yeah, this is an Andre giant. So it's like it's kind of like a getting a fire hose like stream in there.
605.88 658.48 speaker2  Maybe I would assume I picked up my dice tray and I showed it to Joe. I saw that you want me to share what it was or you want to keep it. So I didn't share what I rolled. possible second before it's going to go to voicemail. She hangs up.
656.28 661.48 speaker1  What the fuck did you do? What did you do?
661.08 666.38 speaker0  Hello.
664.48 670.78 speaker3  My name is Clarissa Sparrow. What did Arvin do to you?
669.68 676.08 speaker1  Who are you?
675.08 685.58 speaker3  We don't know where he is. We're worried for him.
683.18 686.18 speaker1  Be worried for my fucking brother.
685.98 698.38 speaker3  Yeah. So that's kind of I didn't know if you were really on his side or not. Yeah, so you're not neither are we we're not worried for him. We're trying to stop him.
697.28 705.68 speaker1  He killed Quentin.
703.38 722.18 speaker3  He called you two days before your brother died. How do you know Arvin?
721.18 739.48 speaker2  got stuck in. They trapped him there. It tricked him told him the world was different than what it is and he fucked with them. anything. He was not able to be inside. He was different.
737.78 751.08 speaker3  How did they say the world was different?
747.78 774.18 speaker2  I didn't even know that Arvin was a part of it until he called me. I didn't even know his name. He's just sound like an old friend who would lost touch
771.28 806.98 speaker3  Yeah, he told you he was somebody else. I'm gonna kill him.
802.48 852.48 speaker2  a mimicry of the sound that you heard from Arvin Chilton that horrible day the worst day of this man's life. and then you hear him kind of walk away and he's just crying.
851.68 860.48 speaker3  I'm not laughing. I'm trying very hard not to laugh at your me me me's.
859.18 870.08 speaker2  anymore. Okay.
869.58 935.78 speaker3  Duchesne. brutalized. Whoo doggy. more like they got it. They really got it into them with Kevin and they're like this old man is going to be easy to pick on. Let's just beat the shit out of him. by the windows outside. We're like it's raining. Yeah. Wow. Yep. All righty for the first time Clarissa is kind of behind
931.48 941.28 speaker1  Kevin to like she's seen Elwood do so many times we can share
937.98 962.68 speaker3  Yeah now like you're actively crouching behind her to now going down the stairs.
957.98 1204.38 speaker2  Whereas before you would have seen six police officers outside gone their cars are not gone. The only one who's going to lose zero sanity here probably 85 on a now 80. There's like something in him that just represses all of this sanity loss down to absolutely nothing. Whereas the the other the other two of you. I mean seemingly a lot because the Duchesne home is an abattoir a slaughterhouse and the smell of spilled blood like an unwelcome houseguest as you all notice there's been a distinct vibe switch in this withering old man's apartment. It's as if a merciful veil has been cruelly lifted and the reality of your situation begins to sink in as you stare into the face of Arvin Chilton the target of your mission and you know deep down in the sickening turmoil that's brewing at all. Arvin Chilton looks like his photograph but a version that has been completely lost to madness his hair darts in every direction akimbo like his eyes any visible skin is covered in scratches and dried blood and the often mended clothes that wrapped around the short stout landlord now hang awkwardly from his tenants tall gaunt frame the whole confusing and unnatural switcheroo situation is topped by the same old pork pie cat dawned by what had appeared to be Alexander Duchesne, but Arvin Chilton isn't the only horribly unfamiliar thing in this room. The walls are now or always were painted in human blood dirty hands spread and shaped the gore like gruesome finger man seen on the side of the Ocean City Cafe human body parts are strewn throughout this place a loose tongue here a sole foot there a length of dripping intestines is draped over a stained lampshade and in some cases you recognize instances where your eyes must have lied before the ashtray on the coffee table is now a Glock 17 wet with vital fluids the two mops are now Mossberg shotguns where there were once five baseballs placed randomly around there are now four God dude. What is it?
1200.98 1211.28 speaker3  We had an opportunity at the very next time. How did you fall for that?
1206.78 1225.28 speaker2  Guess what the olives are eyeballs eyeballs and guess what
1223.58 1238.28 speaker3  Oh my God.
1232.58 1239.08 speaker2  fail again and Kevin gelato for having eaten eyes and flesh
1238.28 1251.48 speaker3  that one's a fail.
1245.08 1279.28 speaker2  overcome with uncontrollable vomiting for a number of turns equal to the loss three turns. So for three full turns the only action you can take is yacking. Oh and one more change in the scene dressing the copy of as
1278.08 1294.08 speaker1  It's a title changed.
1291.98 1377.68 speaker2  I feel like that seems obvious. So no, it's just a diary. of Arvin Chilton in a pool of their own blood are seven bodies each with their throat slit all uniformed police officers because I fuck you not he out rolled all eight. Police officers. eighth one. He has this cop by the back of the neck and this cop is staring at the three of you with eyes that make you think maybe he's not looking at you even though his eyes are pointed in that direction and as Arvin, let's go of this body you see he's been holding this long knife that has a weird Bend on the end of it this crooked knife and this cop just slides off the end of it and face plants into the ground in front of
1376.88 1398.28 speaker3  How are the bodies looking? Are they are they eyeful or eyeless so far only two of them
1396.88 1404.98 speaker2  Where do you throw up?
1402.48 1412.78 speaker3  I think that's we've lost the sanity because we've peaked in so I'm at least that far inside Kevin gelato normally
1409.68 1428.38 speaker2  when someone loses over five sanity in one go we would have you roll fight flight or faint. However due to what is written in the scenario it says that for the next three rounds you are vomiting and so therefore I'm going to use that as your fight flight or faint response if that's cool with you, that's fine.
1426.28 1556.28 speaker3  Where are you violently throwing it? I had just stepped right inside the door since I was the first you were the first one in and I step right inside see the middle of a giant Stadium hot bright lights shining down on him the crowd is roaring Kevin is staring across the field giving a menacing look to Tom Brady Tom has a nervous look on his face and sweat is pouring off his forehead into Brady Brady's head comes clean off his body is the Tom Brady's head and holds it up in the air proudly displaying So I don't think I'm going to do it Kev. That's insane. Elwood walks in. We were just talking about Kevin's future football career You're better off here with me. We can do big things together together together and then the camera zooms out to Kevin puking in this living room.
1550.98 1596.38 speaker2  Agent Sparrow's eyes meet the eyes of Arvin Chilton and they are absolutely crazed standing above eight slumped uniformed ocean shitty PD officers. Hey, man, only people from Ocean Shitty can say that.
1595.28 1597.38 speaker3  What'd you roll, Thomas?
1596.58 1608.18 speaker2  I rolled a one. Get that fight going, baby. Agent Sparrow, her eyes are darting around at this whole
1604.08 1630.08 speaker3  situation is she's trying to balance her FBI agent mind, her Delta Green agent mind, her student body president agent mind. It all builds to just, I've got to destroy this. Yeah, and she picks up one of the grenades. Yeah, pulls the pin on her own. Oh, yeah, and just tosses it like right towards him and the bucket of dynamite.
1628.48 1638.48 speaker2  Oh my God, what?
1636.58 1645.98 speaker3  together would take out a block, wouldn't it?
1638.48 1664.68 speaker2  So in Delta Green, there is a 15% lethality rating for M67 grenades within 10 meters. What about dynamite? Which is easily within this and then within dynamite is going to have a 10% lethality rating within 20 meters. And how many sticks are there?
1660.18 1669.08 speaker3  There were 19 sticks of dynamite in this bucket.
1664.68 1702.98 speaker2  It is absolutely going to compound and Agent Sparrow has chosen to end this threat. You really don't even have to pass this check for everyone to die.
1700.88 1709.08 speaker3  It lands right in the bucket of dynamite.
1704.78 1724.28 speaker2  You really based on the lethality of 19 sticks of dynamite as well as these two grenades and the other grenades in this room, which is three more.
1718.28 1776.38 speaker3  She takes one last look around at Kevin and Elwood and she's like, man, if we'd gotten three or four more episodes with these characters, I might have really cracked something in That thought manifests as just like a small glint in her eye before the entire room is a ball of light and flame. Elwood as he's puking puts his hand on Kevin's back. Kevin is still throwing up, but he sees the grenade get launched in there. He grabs Elwood and just lays like on top of him to try to prevent Elwood from getting exploded.
1774.48 1815.28 speaker2  Early Grand Theft Auto. Look at this scene. This two-story duplex fucking explodes. All the cars on the street are
1813.18 1821.48 speaker3  Every dog is barking. Twitter is blowing up. Did you guys hear that noise?
1819.88 1861.58 speaker2  And yeah, everyone is just a sonic boom. So here's what we're going to do. I'm going to have Luke roll the last roll of the scenario. Don't roll yet, please. I'm going to add and you've got a plus 10 due to the luck. And what role do you think would satisfy the requirement of covering the body of Elwood Boyd enough to shelter him from this absolute blast?
1859.78 1911.18 speaker3  Strength or athletics a thing, right? Let's see. Yeah, like your con. I could do con. You could not fail. Is there anything you have at a 70? So that at least gave a little leeway and I saw the nine
1908.48 2024.58 speaker2  red and blue lights cover everything. Red-eyed night shift EMTs begin uncovering 107 East 12th Street Ocean City, New Jersey as they're picking through body off the top of him. Somebody get the ambulance over here everybody. We need a stretcher. We need a stretcher now. the goggles on the corpse of Kevin gelato?
2022.78 2239.48 speaker1  Death in the face. I'll be all right. I can go there now. now make us cry. Doesn't it always seem like the villain Paul in the strings is a regular guy. You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise. Kerosene wipes clean what we couldn't bear to tarnish. I'll be all right. I can go there now. I'll be all right. I can go there now. There's a conundrum in the wisdom of my spirit. White washed hymns and the deadly sins push me to my limit. When you deconstruct, you shit out of luck for a minute. After the last bend, you can break it all down to rebuild it. You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise. You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise. You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise. You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise. He's trying to eat another grinder. I promise.
