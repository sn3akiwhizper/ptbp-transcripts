0	3240	This is yet another introduction to a show
3240	7460	that you listen to called, well it's broadcast live
7460	12460	from 694.2 PTBP and I'm your benevolent host
12940	15860	with the gross wolf the dog.
15860	18340	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Ash
18340	21520	out of North Carolina who tweeted about the show
21520	23740	and tagged that pretending pod,
23740	25540	which is a nice thing to do.
25540	29700	She writes, hey there, I don't have anything to promote,
29700	33300	just wanna let you know how much this show means to me.
33300	35500	I listen every day while I'm at work
35500	37760	and it passes the time so fast,
37760	41000	my job feels almost inconsequential.
41000	45220	Almost as if the atrocities I've committed don't affect me.
45220	48760	As if I can't hear the violent snapping of tendons
48760	52000	and viscera emanating from my monitor.
52000	54900	A mere taste of the despair that lies
54900	57160	within the nightmare network.
57160	61400	Shout out to my friend Gwen for showing me PTBP
61400	63940	and keep up the great work.
63940	66840	Hmm, nightmare network?
66840	69240	Did you just try to sneak in promotion
69240	72980	for another media channel that isn't my radio station
72980	76120	on my radio station?
76120	80440	Hmm, I shall be contacting my lawyers.
80440	85440	They are definitely real and definitely will do law things
85640	87560	at you, for sure.
87560	90080	If you wanna write up something for your wolf to howl,
90080	93120	tag us on the internet or fuck the zuck,
93120	95760	but preferably write us a five star review
95760	99040	on your podcast listening application.
99040	102860	Whichever way you choose, it's time for the news.
102860	106520	Last time we met Dr. Rusty Hooch,
106520	109040	the never missed scientist.
109040	113720	They insist that she enlist, create an ocean of blue mist.
113760	117320	Her ex was pissed, you get the gist.
117320	121760	Dr. Olivia Miller, the sad single mom surgeon.
121760	124560	Her daughter saw her dissect some sort
124560	126920	of a extra dimensional creature
126920	129080	out of a screaming woman's neck
129080	132200	and it shot into a sir's snot socket
132200	134160	who was promptly shot in the skull
134160	138000	by his sorrowful sidekick, full stop.
138000	140840	Next, Doreen Maureen.
140840	145600	Scroll Pinterest on that iPad, that's a good haiku.
145600	149960	Finally, the step motherfucker himself, the Chuckster.
149960	152360	Coming in at five foot seven,
152360	157120	213 pounds of round muscle that is.
157120	160420	It's ball buster 420, hell yeah.
160420	163720	And he survived the holy suffocating,
163720	167240	holy decapitating tongue from hell.
167240	169480	Well, it's time for the briefing.
169600	171640	Yep, you can hear that creeping.
171640	176640	If your ears aren't leaking, it's Molly Healy with circles.
187120	189700	See ring star, deafening heaps.
193000	195840	You don't know where you found it.
195840	200680	In this state, as your eyes fall short,
200680	205680	you better learn how to keep it.
210880	212720	Welcome to Pretending to Be People.
212720	215120	I am here with the same people who are here
215120	218040	on episode one, part one of this story.
218040	219840	It is now part two.
219840	223840	Let's go around the room as well as the TV.
223840	228840	Eleanor is on a TV on our kitchen countertop here.
230960	234040	We'll take a group photo at the end of this
234040	235520	with us and the TV.
235520	238200	That way we can all have a picture together.
238200	239040	Oh, that's right.
239040	239920	Oh, sorry.
242040	244400	And you can put up a picture of yourself.
249720	251080	Let me know when you want to take the picture
251080	253240	and I'll put up like some glam shots.
254120	254960	Yeah, perfect.
257360	258200	You sell it.
258200	260160	Ellie on the kitchen counter, the nudes.
260160	261000	No, okay.
264000	266680	You guys, that's how you make money in this industry.
268920	271720	I've been trying, Eleanor, but-
271720	273520	Dude, more feet, more feet.
273520	275480	Oh, okay, yeah.
275480	278200	More feet in this audio podcast.
278200	280960	Oh no, they want to see it, they want to see it.
280960	282160	All right, let's go around.
282160	285320	Everyone, if you could just like say your name,
285320	287080	your character's name,
287080	290080	and then the worst thought you've ever had about your mom.
290080	291680	So let's start with Allie.
291680	293120	Ooh, can't wait.
293120	294960	My name's Allie.
294960	298160	My character name is Rusty Hooch, Dr. Hooch.
298160	301000	The worst thought I've ever had about my mom
301000	303240	is that I'm exactly like her.
305880	308080	Way to sidestep the question.
308080	311080	Also, you don't have to answer that, any of you.
311080	314520	Jen, if you're listening, I love you, and she will.
314520	315360	Really?
315360	316200	Probably.
316200	317040	Interesting.
317040	317880	Hi, Jen.
319680	321280	My mom won't listen.
321280	322760	Lindsay, you're up.
322760	323600	I'm Lindsay.
323600	327800	I play Doreen, Maureen, or Chlorine, or Boreen,
327800	329160	or whatever you want to call me.
329160	330480	First name, Doreen.
330480	334120	And the worst thought I've had about my mom
334120	336680	is probably that I based this character off of her.
339040	340400	And she won't be listening.
340400	344400	She will not even know that this exists.
344400	346800	I'm going to, what, Facebook?
346800	348640	I have Facebook here.
348640	349840	It's like, I'll tweet at it.
349840	350400	No, I'm probably not.
350400	351200	Because she definitely has a Facebook.
351200	351720	Pinterest.
351720	352240	Pinterest.
352240	353720	You can just DM her on Pinterest.
353720	355800	Slide into her Pinterest DMs.
355800	358840	That's the most definite way to get a hold of her.
358840	360360	Eleanor, who are you playing?
360360	361600	What's up?
361600	366480	Hi, I'm Eleanor DiLorenzo, and I play Dr. Olivia Miller.
366480	368800	And do you want to know the best thoughts
368840	370560	I've had about your mom, Zach?
370560	373200	Yes.
373200	375040	Yes.
375040	378000	OK, actually, I don't know anything about your mom.
378000	379520	But what's her, never mind.
379520	380280	We're not going to go down this road.
380280	381720	You're going to dox my mom?
381720	384080	I'm not going to dox your mom, no.
384080	385240	I'm sure she's a lovely lady.
385240	388800	Most American ladies I've met are super kind and sweet.
388800	390840	So I'm sure she's great.
390840	393640	My mom, on the other hand, what a, no.
393640	398200	She's the worst thought I've had about my mom is,
398200	399520	oh, shit, yeah, I don't know.
399520	402480	I feel like you can't talk shit about your mom
402480	405320	if you have a good mom, because moms are the best.
405320	407760	So I feel bad about even considering
407760	410960	like the list of awful things.
410960	417440	But so I'm thinking, I'm trying like, hmm, one time
417440	422840	she made like a pretty nasty chicken tikka masala.
422840	425400	So that's.
425400	427880	It sounds like you went through a lot of early life trauma.
428720	430920	Yeah, exactly, exactly.
430920	435560	So, yeah, that's the worst mom thought I've had.
437440	438640	And Taylor?
438640	440400	Hi, my name is Taylor.
440400	445120	My character name is Chuck Cheese.
445120	446280	Oh, yeah?
446280	447120	Charles Cheese.
447120	447960	Charles Cheese.
447960	449880	You're going with Charles the Chuckster Cheese?
449880	450840	Charles the Chuckster Cheese.
450840	452440	You can call me Chuck or the Chuckster.
452440	453920	What's your middle name?
453920	457560	Chuckster, Charles Chuckster Cheese.
459120	460640	Charles Chuckster Cheese.
460640	461240	OK, anyway.
461240	462880	My mother-in-law rules, so.
462880	464360	I will say, though, I've had time
464360	466760	to think about this because I was the last one to go.
466760	470560	And when I was a kid, I would walk to and from school
470560	471800	and elementary school.
471800	474760	And if I was mad at my mom, I would intentionally
474760	479560	step on all the cracks to break my mother's back.
479560	480680	Wow, violence.
480680	482600	Did she have back problems?
482600	485320	Yeah, actually, yeah, she had to get a breast reduction
485320	487960	because her boobs are so big it hurt her back.
488200	489920	You're making your mom's boobs bigger
489920	492160	by stepping on the cracks?
492160	494840	Yeah, every time it's like a Pinocchio.
494840	497040	They just grew and grew.
497040	500760	Apparently, my grandma had to do that, the breast reduction.
500760	506400	And I was like, give me those titties.
506400	508800	Literally, it happened in middle school.
508800	511720	And I had a lot of sleepovers as a kid.
511720	514400	And after my mom got the surgery,
514400	517400	any time my friend came over, she was like, look.
517440	522520	And just lift up her shirt and show her smaller scarred boobs.
522520	524440	Do they shape them?
524440	525760	Do they shape them?
525760	526280	They do.
526280	529880	So they look like perky nice titties, huh?
529880	534800	Yeah, she went from double Fs to perky Cs.
534800	536320	So Zach, are you really happy we're
536320	538000	talking about your mother-in-law's boobs
538000	539320	on your podcast?
539320	540880	Yeah, good.
540880	543320	What are your thoughts, Zach, about your mother-in-law's
543320	543820	boobs?
543820	549300	I was really prepared to answer that question
549300	550020	until you finished.
556020	557380	So my thought about mom's boobs.
557380	561020	You can talk about your own mom's boobs if that's easier.
561020	564700	Tell us about your own mom's boobs.
564700	570340	When I was 17, my birthday landed on Easter Sunday.
570340	573500	And so the whole family came over on my birthday
573500	575180	after church.
575180	577340	I'd been going camping with my friends a lot.
577340	581660	And so my mom got me a camping chair, a really nice one,
581660	584620	because I used to borrow their camping chairs.
584620	586980	This was her really nice way of being like,
586980	589700	stop fucking taking my camping chairs.
589700	591500	So she bought me my own.
591500	593780	And I was so stoked, actually.
593780	594780	I was like, this is rad.
594780	595340	This is great.
595340	596700	It's huge.
596700	598220	It was like a big one.
598260	601140	And she's like, yeah, it's oversized.
601140	605420	So it can actually hold up to 250 pounds,
605420	607340	which was pretty cool of her to say
607340	610140	to her very chunky young boy.
610140	612420	So happy birthday to you.
612420	613820	Self-conscious son.
613820	614940	Yeah, yeah.
614940	616500	It's called a captain's chair, right?
616500	620180	It is a captain's chair, extra large, oversized.
620180	621420	For oversized boys.
621420	624460	For oversized boys who are addicted to Mountain Dew
624460	626580	and White Rum.
626580	629180	All right, so let's dive into it.
629180	630020	Dude, Mountain.
630020	630900	Oh, right, actually.
630900	633420	I was going to tangentally about the topic.
633420	635140	I don't even know how to say tangentally.
635140	636020	You know what I'm talking about.
636020	636540	Tangent.
636540	637380	Yeah.
637380	637900	OK.
637900	638380	One more.
638380	638980	One more.
638980	640100	I want to.
640100	641060	One more boob.
641060	644060	No, no, it's not about boobs, but it's about cool women.
644060	645700	I have a cool story about my aunt.
645700	649340	Men in her family would take off their shirts very often
649340	652140	when it was in the summer months in Sweden,
652140	654820	because that's socially acceptable for men
654820	656420	to wear their boobs out.
656460	658180	But even at the dinner table, she's like,
658180	659540	please put on a shirt.
659540	660860	And they're like, fuck off.
660860	661700	Maybe not.
661700	664740	They didn't say that, but maybe something similar to that.
664740	666740	And so one day, she was like, OK.
666740	672580	And she's a 65-year-old woman, and she took off her shirt
672580	675020	and sat down to eat at the table.
675020	677740	And I'm like, that's my goal in life.
677740	680500	I want to take off my shirt.
680500	682220	So we should all take our shirts off?
682220	682940	Yes.
682940	683780	OK, great.
683780	684780	No one will know.
684780	685940	No one will know, guys.
685940	687940	It's an audio drama.
687940	688580	I don't know.
688580	691380	I don't know.
691380	694580	Maybe it will be funnier, just more vulnerable.
694580	696700	Just do sounds with taking your turn off.
696700	697700	Make for better audio.
697700	698540	Vroop.
698540	699420	Vroop.
699420	700820	Skier.
700820	702060	Ding-dong.
702060	703020	Ding-dong-dong-dong-dong.
703020	703900	I get it.
703900	704420	I get it.
704420	705020	I understand.
705020	706780	All right, let's dive into this episode.
706780	707300	Yeah.
711100	712540	Y'all ready to play some Delta Green?
712540	715020	I think we got a pretty good introduction to your characters
715060	716220	in episode one.
716220	719740	The way in which the game works is now going to change,
719740	723460	because we're going to put you all in the same place
723460	725820	and then send you on a little mission.
725820	726620	OK?
726620	727220	OK.
727220	727980	OK.
727980	729500	All right.
729500	730060	Oh, no.
733380	736660	At least a year has passed since each of you
736660	739340	had your unnatural encounters that brought you
739340	740660	into Delta Green.
740660	743740	And here you are again, going into the field
743740	747780	with three strangers sitting in the back of a Sprinter
747780	753900	van turned into a mobile lab in the parking lot of a public park
753900	759580	with no cameras in Shreveport, Mississippi at 2,200
759580	762940	on a cold January night.
762940	767500	Anything to stave off the end of the world, right?
767500	771780	Your handler on this one is a bit dramatic.
771900	775420	Three years ago, this guy's just like talking with his hands.
775420	776260	He's super intense.
776260	778420	He's leaning into all of you as he talks.
778420	784020	Three years ago, Jerome Dyer left his job in Dallas
784020	785580	as an intelligence analyst.
785580	790420	During his second night at the opera, he left.
790420	791860	He abandoned his post.
791860	797940	And he joined a group called Bigfoot Underground Search
797940	799380	and Hunt.
799420	805940	He's been radio silent for three years until tonight.
805940	809180	Dyer made contact with a YouTube account
809180	815860	I run posing as professor and Bigfoot enthusiast Dr. Ann
815860	816900	Falsom.
816900	820460	And this guy looks super proud of himself when he says this.
820460	823380	Agent Dyer is desperately seeking extraction,
823380	825380	but not for him.
825380	830660	For a body, a big body, from an isolated cabin
830660	834820	in the thick, verdant hills of southwest Arkansas
834820	838460	near a small town called Fook.
838460	841980	I've pinned the location on these clean phones.
841980	844540	And he hands you each an older model iPhone
844540	848260	with various used cases on them.
848260	852740	The cases are so that the phone doesn't get shattered, Ali.
852740	854420	Wow.
854420	857180	Called out.
857180	860340	OK, OK, so I've gotten super into Bigfoot Underground
860340	864260	Search and Hunt while portraying this Dr. Ann Falsom.
864260	868220	And the origin story of their ringleader, Carl Lambert,
868220	870780	is fucking tragic.
870780	871700	Check this out.
871700	875060	When he was 14 years old, he went out
875060	879300	camping with his dad and his younger brother Michael,
879300	881740	who was 12 at the time.
881740	885460	So this Bigfoot sneaks into their camp in the night
885460	888140	and abducts the younger brother.
888140	890620	Carl and his dad tried to explain what happened,
890620	893060	but who's going to believe them?
893060	896460	Everyone just assumed the dad killed the boy
896460	900700	and pressured Carl into telling the Bigfoot story.
900700	903420	So dad decides he can't handle being
903420	906060	tried for his son's murder.
906060	911340	So he offs himself, which leaves 14-year-old Carl
911340	914700	with a very singular mission.
914700	918100	Find Bigfoot and kill it.
918100	922780	It's been three decades, but it seems like he finally did it.
922780	926620	So the operation, go to that point, go to the cabin.
926620	929020	Again, GPS marked in those phones.
929020	930620	They have cases on them, don't worry.
930620	932140	Secure the body.
932140	934020	Destroy any evidence.
934020	938060	We can't have, obviously, we can't have this getting out.
938060	942620	Agent Dyer is sabotaging the Wi-Fi and the cell networks
942620	943260	up there.
943260	947140	So Carl and Janice won't be able to post anything
947140	948780	unless they figure out what he's up to.
948780	951860	Oh, Janice Ruth, their third musketeer,
951860	955500	she's a conservation agent, mostly hunts down poachers.
955500	958740	She keeps her identity hidden from most
958740	962060	of the Bigfoot underground search and hunt fan base.
962060	964540	They'd probably deem her untrustworthy, right,
964540	965860	because she works for the man.
969060	970540	Bless you.
970540	973900	He takes another huge rip off of La Croix.
973900	978140	Ruth considers her bachelor's degree in zoology
978140	981540	essentially worthless compared to her countless hours spent
981540	985260	learning everything there is to know about Bigfoot ecology,
985260	988700	behavior, migration on the YouTube channels
988700	990180	of her perceived peers.
990180	990980	Shit.
990980	993380	Sorry, that's so much information.
993380	996540	He looks at his watch and waggles his eyebrows.
996540	1002380	Dr. Anne Falsom, with quotes, should be getting on her way.
1002380	1005220	But that's one of you, obviously.
1005220	1007500	One of you has to be Dr. Anne Falsom when you get there
1007500	1008500	to secure the body, right?
1008500	1010460	Because I've told you that's the whole deal, right?
1010460	1011900	Real quick, do you guys have any questions?
1011900	1012740	I have a question.
1012740	1013220	Yeah.
1013220	1014300	What the fuck is going on?
1017780	1018300	Yeah.
1018300	1021980	We are dealing with a conspiracy theorist, I'm assuming.
1021980	1024020	Someone who believes in Bigfoot, and we're
1024020	1026540	here to look into a body.
1026540	1028620	I don't know what this could possibly be, obviously,
1028620	1030780	based on this description I was given.
1030780	1031620	Yeah, it's a Bigfoot.
1031620	1032340	OK.
1032340	1037340	Well, how about I make that call when I see what we see?
1037340	1038700	That's why we hired you guys.
1038700	1040300	That's why we got two of the smallest.
1040300	1041740	Oh, yeah.
1041740	1043460	Are you still going by?
1043460	1045020	The juxtaposer.
1045020	1046500	Yeah.
1046500	1049380	So honored to be in the presence of such righteous ladies.
1050300	1050780	Fuck.
1053540	1054020	Very.
1054020	1056860	So what's your expertise, Chuckster?
1056860	1059820	Well, you see, I've seen a lot of battle in my day,
1059820	1062860	fought a lot of not-so-good guys,
1062860	1066060	and I'm here to keep you ladies safe.
1066060	1066740	Yikes.
1066740	1067980	All right.
1067980	1070860	Dr. Miller taps, absent mindingly,
1070860	1075060	her revolver she has in her pants,
1075060	1077860	stuck to the top of the way in her pants because she's like,
1077860	1081500	guess I will be protecting myself for the rest of the day.
1081500	1082540	Dope gun.
1082540	1083540	What's the range on that?
1083540	1086620	Can I hold it?
1086620	1088780	Isn't that like sharing a glass of water?
1088780	1090220	I mean, we just met.
1090220	1091300	Cool, cool, cool, cool.
1091300	1092020	I understand.
1092020	1092660	I understand.
1092660	1094900	We all got our weapons.
1094900	1096860	Dr. Miller has no idea what a range is.
1096860	1098620	Or is that Ellie, who has no idea what?
1098620	1100780	I know nothing about guns, but.
1100780	1102020	I don't either, literally.
1102020	1102620	OK, good.
1102620	1105020	All right, 22 miles.
1105060	1108220	For people who've listened to pretending to be people before,
1108220	1116060	normally when someone's like, I pull out my M6942K AK-47
1116060	1118540	silencer laser pointer, I'm like, all right, yeah,
1118540	1119740	that's a gun.
1119740	1124340	So roll for shooting a gun.
1124340	1125060	That's me.
1125060	1126460	Some Delta Green people are super
1126460	1128260	into that side of Delta Green.
1128260	1130980	I'm all for that, but I don't know any of it.
1130980	1133580	So therefore, I'm not super into it.
1133580	1136020	So gun, shoot, pew pew.
1139020	1143940	Doreen is like somewhere in between the Chuckster
1143940	1147140	and the intelligence of these two doctors.
1147140	1149860	So she's just kind of taking it all in.
1149860	1154580	She knows that she, as an agent, has more capability
1154580	1157340	than the Chuckster, but is not going to say anything.
1157340	1162500	It's just going to be, you know, she'll let the Chuckster think.
1162500	1164460	Chuckster is just raw confidence.
1164460	1166540	That's what he works on.
1166540	1167780	And that's fine.
1167780	1168820	That's fine with Doreen.
1168820	1173140	Doreen can be our audience stand-in for just looking
1173140	1175820	back and forth between these two groups,
1175820	1177380	these intelligent doctors.
1177380	1180020	She's also just constantly looking over her shoulder,
1180020	1182180	assuming she's going to see children somewhere.
1182180	1187540	So not that good.
1187540	1189460	Anyone want a brewski?
1189460	1194540	I keep them in my refrigerator pack pant pockets.
1194540	1199020	You see, I invented a mechanism you can put in pants
1199020	1202020	with their insulated pockets and ice packs
1202020	1203620	so I can always keep my beers cold.
1203620	1204780	What's your name again?
1204780	1206980	I think maybe you'll just want to call me Charles.
1206980	1210220	All right, Charles, it is 6.30 AM.
1210220	1211380	If you can please get that.
1211380	1213140	It's late at night.
1213140	1214140	It's 2,200.
1214140	1215820	It is literally 6.30 AM.
1215820	1217140	It's 10 PM.
1217140	1218940	Get that brewski away from me.
1218980	1219980	It is party time.
1219980	1222060	I understand, I understand.
1222060	1224900	Doreen takes him up on the offer.
1224900	1226220	Dr. Miller is very intrigued.
1226220	1228860	She's like, a wearable fridge.
1228860	1231460	That could be quite useful, actually, in terms of,
1231460	1235620	we will, in order to keep certain vaccines cold.
1235620	1238980	Happy to share my pants with you.
1238980	1239900	All right.
1239900	1242940	Well, for now, let's keep the pants on, Chucky.
1242940	1246260	And maybe I'll take you up on that offer later.
1246260	1247460	We'll see how tonight goes.
1247500	1249580	OK, I'm now uncomfortable.
1249580	1251220	So I'm going to get the fuck out of here.
1251220	1254100	You guys need to get going.
1254100	1257500	They expect Ann to be, Dr. Falsom, sorry,
1257500	1258900	to be up there soon.
1258900	1260940	So whoever wants it can have it.
1260940	1264860	And he throws down four IDs on this table.
1264860	1266820	And you're in a Sprinter van, right?
1266820	1269860	But it's been transformed into a lab in the back.
1269860	1272180	So there is almost like an ambulance.
1272180	1275540	There's going to be a stretcher in the middle.
1275540	1277500	So you guys are kind of sitting on either side
1277500	1278500	of this stretcher.
1278500	1280420	And he slams down four IDs.
1280420	1283460	They all say, Dr. Ann Falsom, they
1283460	1285460	have each of your pictures on.
1285460	1286780	So he's like, your choice.
1286780	1289260	Whoever wants to take lead on it can do it.
1289260	1291340	But I got to get out of here.
1291340	1294460	My number is in those clean cells, right?
1294460	1299220	So once you have the body, shoot me a call.
1299220	1303220	The second location that's in those phones,
1303220	1306380	GPS, is going to be the drop off point.
1306380	1307620	So I've got a warehouse.
1307620	1309700	I'll meet you there after the mission is up.
1309700	1313900	So I have all the faith in you that I should.
1313900	1314860	You're very intelligent.
1314860	1315940	You're very capable.
1315940	1318700	He looks at two different groups when he says those things.
1318700	1321100	And that'll be it for me.
1321100	1322380	I'm going to get going.
1322380	1327900	And he kind of opens up the back doors of this Sprinter van
1327900	1330820	and walks off into the parking lot, presumably
1330820	1331740	to be picked up.
1331740	1332700	He turns back around.
1332780	1336700	And he's like, oh, yeah, OK, bye, yep, all right.
1336700	1337740	Bye, bro.
1337740	1339620	OK, yep.
1339620	1340260	See you, man.
1340260	1340740	All right.
1340740	1342940	And he finally just turns back around.
1342940	1345740	You hear a truck start on the other side of the parking lot.
1345740	1347220	And it swings by and picks him up.
1347220	1348860	And the truck heads out.
1348860	1352060	You are now, the four of you, alone,
1352060	1354300	I mean, with three strangers, in the back
1354300	1358940	of this converted mobile lab slash mobile ambulance
1358940	1361700	kind of thing that just looks like a standard Sprinter
1361740	1364620	van on the outside.
1364620	1366740	So I'm a pretty dank actor.
1366740	1370260	But I don't know that I'm so much the doctor type.
1370260	1374020	So maybe someone wants to take lead on being that doctor.
1374020	1376380	I think, clearly, I need to be the one to do this.
1376380	1377660	None of y'all can handle it.
1377660	1379420	You do seem real right smart.
1379420	1380820	And I like them bangs, girl.
1380820	1382820	I am a lesbian.
1382820	1383980	Stay away from me.
1389580	1390540	All right.
1391380	1397700	Hey, Ellie, Eleanor, I'm going to ask
1397700	1399780	Allie to explain something real quick.
1403860	1407620	What do you even mean, Zach?
1407620	1409580	Well, I'm just curious about a couple of things.
1413460	1415780	Do you want to explain kind of your thought process
1415780	1419060	going into creating a character for being on the show again?
1419100	1421540	Yes, so this is my third time on the show.
1421540	1423140	First time I played a straight man.
1423140	1426740	The second time I played a closeted lesbian.
1426740	1429860	At the time, I was identifying as straight.
1429860	1434220	I am now playing an out lesbian and am an out lesbian.
1434220	1437380	But you're manifesting pilot this time, right?
1437380	1439380	So I'm going to be a pilot next.
1439380	1441820	But the funny thing is there was a time in the middle
1441820	1444620	where I was like, I cannot believe how problematic it is
1444620	1448540	that I, as a straight woman, played a lesbian on that show.
1448540	1449460	That's so terrible.
1449460	1451900	And now it's fine.
1451900	1453980	It's actually the only reason she became a lesbian.
1453980	1455420	There's a cover for that.
1455420	1458100	That's my testimony from being on pretending to be people.
1458100	1460940	I became gay.
1460940	1462140	I love it.
1462140	1465420	What have you guys done for the show?
1465420	1466620	Anyways.
1466620	1469660	OK, so back into the Sprinter van, the back of the van.
1469660	1470980	You guys have this information.
1470980	1474740	You know that it is called Bigfoot Underground Search
1474740	1475740	and Hunt.
1475780	1478660	The ringleader's name is Carl Lambert.
1478660	1480900	The other two people helping out
1480900	1483300	with Bigfoot Underground Search and Hunt
1483300	1486740	are Janice Ruth, who is a conservation agent
1486740	1488860	and Bigfoot expert,
1488860	1493500	and an undercover Delta Green agent named Jerome Dyer,
1493500	1496820	who has been in the field now for three years
1496820	1498540	working with this group.
1498540	1501540	So clearly, he saw something early on with him
1501540	1504580	that showed him, I need to stick with these people
1504580	1507060	and make sure nothing crazy happens because they
1507060	1508540	seem to be onto something.
1508540	1514340	So Dr. Rusty Hooch picks up this ID
1514340	1519340	that's got her face on it, her bangs,
1519340	1520700	and the name Dr. Ann Falsom.
1520700	1521220	So hold on.
1521220	1525220	Are the rest of us playing pretend characters?
1525220	1527180	You can be anyone you want.
1527180	1530860	You can present yourselves as whatever kind of team
1530860	1531580	you would like.
1531580	1536340	But this is just a way to get through the front gate,
1536340	1538140	if you will, a way to get in the door.
1538140	1542700	So Dr. Ann Falsom's credentials are she is a, sorry,
1542700	1543660	medical doctor?
1543660	1547780	And Bigfoot enthusiast, who has been posting she,
1547780	1551380	quote unquote, this hand letter as Dr. Ann Falsom has been
1551380	1556740	posting comments and DMing back and forth with the Bigfoot
1556740	1559220	Underground Search and Hunt YouTube page.
1559220	1560860	So they're going to trust her immediately.
1560860	1564860	Yes, because she would be the obvious first choice
1564860	1567820	to call upon finding an actual body
1567820	1569900	so that they can have someone who
1569900	1573060	is respected, quote unquote, in the field
1573060	1576140	to present their discovery.
1576140	1580060	What are the skills they would expect from this Dr. Falsom,
1580060	1580980	whatever her name is?
1580980	1585300	They want her to come in and be like, yes, this is Bigfoot.
1585900	1589860	They want her to probably name it scientifically, right?
1589860	1594860	And then just be there standing, like a product that
1594860	1597380	is for sale, but no one wants to buy it.
1597380	1600180	So they have a doctor come on the screen and be like,
1600180	1601300	I'm a doctor.
1601300	1606900	So Dr. Miller agrees that a rusty hooch can take on the role
1606900	1610260	as this pretend doctor and say, I'll
1610260	1611780	be your second in command then.
1611780	1613060	I'll support you.
1613060	1615620	Are we like med students?
1615620	1617180	Yeah, we're part of the team.
1617180	1618740	I think to make it more believable,
1618740	1621380	maybe just say we're med students like first year,
1621380	1624260	like here to offer hands.
1624260	1625940	Yeah, that sounds good.
1625940	1627820	Dr. Hooch is pretty, she's having
1627820	1629220	a lot of mixed emotions right now
1629220	1632580	because she grabbed the ID because she's really
1632580	1634940	feeling like she's surrounded by idiots,
1634940	1638020	except for Dr. Miller, who she's extremely intimidated by.
1638020	1640860	And it's pretty clear that Dr. Miller is smarter than me.
1640860	1643980	So that's why she chose to grab that ID first.
1643980	1646540	But she is getting a little anxious about it
1646540	1648940	now because she actually doesn't believe in Bigfoot
1648940	1653980	and has no idea what she's about to get into.
1653980	1656580	I wonder if Dr. Miller senses that.
1656580	1661020	And she's just like, no, show us the way.
1661020	1662620	I'm sure it will be fine.
1662620	1664260	And then like, rinse.
1664260	1667140	She grins and can see like her teeth,
1667140	1669140	like in a very predatory way, like.
1678140	1678980	Who's driving?
1678980	1679820	I'll drive.
1679820	1681860	Damn straight.
1681860	1685740	Dr. Miller, may I call you Olivia or Liv
1685740	1687500	or the Livmeister?
1687500	1689220	Like what terms are we on here?
1689220	1691220	Dr. Miller is fine, thank you.
1691220	1695180	You guys are on a 50-minute drive from Shreveport,
1695180	1699540	Mississippi, all the way up into the fucking
1699540	1701660	boonies of Arkansas.
1701660	1703820	So when you guys are driving through Arkansas,
1703820	1705300	it is late at night.
1705300	1709300	You're coming up on, let's see, 2230, 2330.
1709300	1712140	So it's around 11.15 PM.
1712140	1714740	You're 15 minutes out from the destination.
1714740	1716740	And you're driving through the mountains
1716740	1718620	and you're driving through the mountains
1718780	1721100	You're 15 minutes out from the destination
1721100	1725860	and you start hitting windy turns deep into the woods.
1725860	1730340	You haven't seen a gas station or any business
1730340	1733140	in 10 minutes or so.
1733140	1735580	And you're not sure that there's anyone,
1735580	1739140	any business that is further into these woods.
1739140	1742100	Every once in a while, you'll see a small house
1742100	1745820	or a trailer deep kind of hidden in the woods
1745820	1747420	on either side of the road,
1747940	1752660	that is it's like a archway of trees and thick branches.
1752660	1756380	So you can barely even make out the night sky above you.
1757460	1760860	You're in a part of the country where you'd feel
1760860	1764220	fairly uncomfortable if this Sprinter van
1764220	1765980	were to break down.
1765980	1768380	Yeah, I've been in those parts of Arkansas.
1768380	1770140	Well, cool, I have not.
1771500	1774260	Your GPS is getting closer and closer.
1774260	1776500	And as you get toward it,
1776500	1779060	you're starting to lose cell signal.
1779060	1783740	And you remember that your handler mentioned Jerome Dyer,
1783740	1787940	Agent Dyer was sabotaging the cell signal up here
1787940	1791460	so that no photos or videos of this body
1791460	1793900	that they've taken can get out.
1793900	1795580	So as you're losing signal,
1795580	1799540	your dot begins to just kind of float
1800900	1804180	and there are no more roads on the screen,
1804180	1806500	but you can kind of make out where you are
1806500	1811500	in relation to where the dot that you're headed toward is.
1811660	1816660	And eventually you see a mailbox in the darkness,
1817300	1819820	your headlights lighting it up.
1821140	1825660	And there's a road that leads off to the left gravel road
1825660	1828460	with a gate, a red metal gate.
1828460	1830580	Y'all, I'm so sorry, but we got to go back.
1830580	1832820	I actually need cell service for another hour.
1832860	1834700	We got to go back, I'm sorry.
1834700	1836620	There's something I got to check on.
1836620	1837620	What do you got to check on?
1837620	1839340	It doesn't matter, it's my own personal business.
1839340	1840780	We just got to go back for,
1840780	1842140	can we just come back in an hour?
1842140	1845300	I mean, these people have been out here, what, three years?
1845300	1846740	They can wait another hour.
1846740	1849940	I think Rusty's keeping secrets from us.
1849940	1852820	Doreen who is driving does not say anything
1852820	1853980	and just keeps driving.
1854980	1856580	It's like solid as a rock.
1856580	1860780	Oh my God, Doreen is drunk from the beer she drank.
1860780	1863860	We're letting a drunk driver take us to this gate.
1866220	1868340	If you want me to drive, I could drive now.
1868340	1869280	That'd be fine.
1870540	1872940	Rusty, maybe you and I can have a side adventure.
1872940	1875780	You and I can walk back together, find that cell service.
1875780	1876620	If you look at me one more time.
1876620	1877660	Maybe become best friends.
1877660	1880220	I swear to God, I will break your neck.
1880220	1881140	Man, damn.
1881140	1883100	Fasty lady.
1884460	1885660	I don't know, I like that.
1885660	1889260	Dr. Miller is just staring out through our window,
1889260	1893300	listening to Chucky and Rusty going back and forth
1893300	1897700	and then she's like, we could be as quick as possible
1897700	1899740	so we can get back as soon as possible,
1899740	1901860	but I think we should head on.
1901860	1903140	I mean, we're here on a mission.
1903140	1904660	I know they've been out here for three years,
1904660	1908260	but I've seen some things to worry
1908260	1911380	that there might be more of an emergency.
1911380	1912900	I just want to take a look at it
1912900	1915220	and then I'll make sure that you get back in time
1915220	1918260	for whatever phone call it is that you have to make.
1918260	1920420	Dr. Hooch is extremely intimidated
1920420	1924140	by the doctor and concedes.
1924140	1926100	Oh, you know, by the end of this,
1926100	1928340	I think we're going to be best friends.
1930220	1931380	I sure hope so.
1932300	1935980	Chuckster, you noticed that there is a file
1935980	1939340	that is sitting on the counter space,
1939340	1941260	you know, next to one of the chairs here
1941260	1944500	in the back of this mobile lab.
1944500	1945980	And when you pop it open,
1946020	1948740	it's got a little bit more information about the mission,
1948740	1951380	including a code for the gate.
1951380	1953300	Hey, look, I found this file here
1953300	1955380	and it seems like it's got a bunch of information.
1955380	1958620	Maybe even has a code to the gate.
1958620	1960060	Has your voice changed?
1960060	1961220	It's very possible.
1961220	1963140	I think you went pretty hard Southern
1963140	1966500	after going pretty hard, like excited bro.
1966500	1968780	It's going to wander where it wants.
1968780	1972300	Don't expect consistency in any manner from me.
1972300	1973620	I love it so much.
1973620	1975780	When you got into Mississippi and Arkansas,
1976420	1978420	you started code switching super hard.
1979620	1981620	I just want everyone to be comfortable.
1982780	1984740	Yeah, you're just, you're basically conforming
1984740	1986860	to where we are a little bit, yeah.
1986860	1988900	It's also just where every accent goes
1988900	1991180	when I try to do an accent.
1991180	1992300	I just have the one.
1992300	1994260	I snatched the paper from Chuck
1994260	1996260	because I say, give me this.
1996260	1998220	You don't, you probably don't even know how to read.
1998220	1999060	Let me see this.
1999060	2002340	Yeah, you write after, I'm not very smart man.
2002340	2005140	I'm not very smart man.
2005500	2008220	This is the gamer guy who is like,
2008220	2010900	just stoked to be like, hey, what up, what up?
2010900	2012500	How you living like?
2012500	2015180	Just because I'm confident doesn't mean I'm combative.
2015180	2020180	I respect these ladies, these smart ladies.
2022300	2023940	Honored to be in their presence.
2025940	2028100	Dr. Miller is like, I'm going to die.
2028100	2031260	And so she starts writing down on her cell phone
2031260	2032380	without cell service.
2032380	2034780	She's starting to write down a note for her daughter.
2035460	2038860	So just like, if I don't survive,
2038860	2042100	you can take like, there's the money in this account.
2042100	2045500	And then your asshole father has the rest of the money
2046860	2048300	stashed away somewhere else.
2049500	2052100	She knows she's not going to survive this.
2052100	2055020	Doreen asks for the code.
2055020	2057460	She reaches back and grabs another beer.
2057460	2058900	She's just stressed.
2058900	2062180	She grabs another beer out of the pocket of Chuckie's pants
2062180	2064380	and just chucks the whole thing right there.
2065220	2066060	As you pull up to this gate,
2066060	2070260	you see it's an alpha numerical keyboard
2070260	2071100	that you're looking at.
2071100	2072740	It literally looks like an old,
2072740	2077300	like Macintosh keyboard from like 09
2077300	2079660	that is like the clear blue,
2081340	2084980	colorful keyboard that is like almost duct taped
2084980	2087460	to a stick that's been shoved into the ground
2087460	2089180	and there are wires coming out of it
2089180	2092340	and then going down toward the ground.
2092380	2095260	And then you kind of see the wires above ground
2095260	2097900	going toward this big rusty red gate.
2099620	2100860	The code is Bush.
2105900	2109060	Well, it's Bigfoot underground search and hunt.
2110220	2111660	They call themselves Bush.
2112860	2117660	Doreen takes a huge sigh
2117660	2120380	and then leans her whole upper body out of the window.
2123340	2125060	Do you want to do that?
2125060	2128060	Boop, boop, boop, boop.
2128060	2130300	Oh, it took a long time to hit that H, huh?
2131780	2135300	Doreen is, she might be a little bit above the-
2135300	2136140	A little faded.
2136140	2137540	Yeah, she's a little faded.
2138580	2140180	That's okay, she's capable.
2140180	2144340	As you type in the H, the gate slowly begins to-
2144340	2145180	Beeee!
2145180	2146020	Beeee!
2154700	2156100	It finally stops.
2157860	2159540	In an open position.
2163500	2164340	God damn it.
2164340	2165780	And then you-
2165780	2166620	Yeah.
2166620	2167460	The gate is open.
2167460	2168300	Let's do this.
2168300	2170300	Ahead of you is the same kind of thing
2170300	2173660	where there are trees climbing on either side
2173700	2176100	and then meeting above the driveway.
2176100	2180060	It's a long gravel driveway that goes uphill
2180060	2184700	and then seems to make a slight dogwood left
2184700	2186860	where you see that there's a clearing
2186860	2191860	and lights are coming from a small one room
2192180	2196340	corrugated sheet metal type just room
2196340	2200300	that has been laid on maybe not even a legit foundation.
2200300	2202900	So is this like a shack, like a big-
2202940	2205260	Yeah, it's a big shack.
2205260	2206220	Okay.
2206220	2208740	And then it's like shoddily put together
2208740	2211180	so there's like light coming through cracks.
2211180	2212620	Yes, that is exactly right.
2212620	2213460	Yes.
2213460	2214300	All right.
2214300	2217420	And there's one streetlight that like,
2217420	2220380	it looks like they might've literally stolen
2220380	2225380	a public streetlight and then moved it up by this shack
2225740	2229300	and the light is shining down on a truck
2229300	2230620	that is sitting up there.
2230620	2233100	Were we given anything in the van?
2233100	2235100	Oh, there's shitloads of stuff in the van.
2235100	2235940	Okay.
2235940	2236780	Weapons.
2236780	2239340	Not so much weapons as just like lab equipment,
2239340	2242020	anything you might find in an ambulance.
2242020	2244860	I like to, because you're up against
2244860	2247620	such insurmountable odds,
2247620	2252100	I wanna give you everything you need to try to fight back.
2252100	2255620	So anything that you think of that could be in there
2255620	2258900	is probably in there and that's just a nice way
2258940	2260460	to know that you're fucked.
2260460	2264940	Dr. Mill almost automatically starts scrubbing up
2264940	2267980	like if there's any protective gear, masks,
2267980	2270660	anything of just like assuming that they're gonna go
2270660	2274420	into a fucking shit show of, I don't know.
2274420	2276540	She's very paranoid at this point.
2276540	2279420	And she's assuming that all these dumb asses
2279420	2281620	will do the same but then she realizes maybe
2281620	2283020	that none of them are doing it
2283020	2284260	or I don't know what they are doing
2284260	2287580	but she's just like, oh, perhaps we should,
2287580	2289580	like she's trying to be polite but then like, oh no.
2289580	2293500	Yeah, you kind of point at the three other hazmat suits.
2293500	2296340	I'm just like opening drawers and not closing them
2296340	2301220	and like opening cabinets, like rifling through.
2301220	2302580	Like, what's this?
2302580	2303540	Oh, dope.
2305220	2308100	Doreen is just like rolling her eyes at Chucky
2308100	2311020	and like grabbing her weapons that she just of course
2311020	2313220	has on her as an agent and just putting them
2313220	2315180	in the back of the van,
2315180	2316740	getting ready to put the hazmat suit on
2316740	2319420	and Chucky is just staring with his mouth open
2319420	2322140	at all of the weapons she has.
2322140	2324460	And then she just is staring back at him
2324460	2327260	while she's slowly pulling up her hazmat suit.
2327260	2331500	Oh, dude, I think you and I are gonna be BFF-les.
2331500	2333820	We got some fortune comin'!
2333820	2335140	What's the L?
2335140	2335980	Liver.
2336860	2338180	Pretty sure.
2338180	2339860	It's best friends. Pretty sure.
2339860	2341900	I think it's liver.
2341900	2343780	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2343780	2344900	You wanna see my weapons?
2344900	2346380	I can show you.
2346900	2347740	I got throwing stars.
2347740	2349580	I think it's time.
2349580	2353180	I pull them out and then they're engraved.
2353180	2354660	I have C.
2354660	2355500	C.
2356420	2357260	Oh my God.
2357260	2358100	Oh my God.
2358100	2359700	What's my last name?
2359700	2360820	Oh, C.
2360820	2361660	Cheese.
2361660	2362500	Cheese!
2365100	2366300	Okay, change my mind.
2366300	2368020	Engraved in each of them is just like-
2368020	2368860	Just cheese.
2368860	2369700	A cheddar.
2369700	2373300	It says CCC and then under it there's-
2373300	2374380	A block of cheddar.
2374380	2375380	Yeah, chunk of cheddar.
2375380	2376220	Yeah.
2376940	2377780	It's very good.
2377780	2380180	Please just keep those in your pants.
2380180	2382300	Don't pull those out, please.
2382300	2383580	All right, all right, I understand.
2383580	2387700	Dr. Hooch is very preoccupied with Dr. Miller at this point
2387700	2390980	and she's really fascinated by how professional she's being.
2390980	2393220	So she is sort of trying to imitate it,
2393220	2395980	immediately starts putting on a hazmat suit as well,
2395980	2398140	also starts putting on gloves and things.
2398140	2399220	And she's still in the backseat,
2399220	2400780	but she's like kinda leaning forward
2400780	2402060	so that Dr. Miller will see
2402060	2404220	that she's like taking it seriously now.
2404340	2405700	Ooh.
2405700	2408540	Dr. Miller smiles a little bit to herself
2408540	2411580	and then she turns around to the other two.
2411580	2413900	He's just like, whenever you're ready,
2413900	2417300	we shall have Dr. Hooch lead the way.
2417300	2418140	Dr.
2418980	2421420	Dr. Anne Hooch.
2422620	2424300	Actually- Dr. Anne.
2424300	2425140	What's your name? Falsom.
2425140	2425980	What's your name?
2425980	2426820	Falsom.
2426820	2427940	Anne Falsom. Falsom.
2427940	2430740	F-A-L-S-O-M.
2430740	2432940	Oh, right, no, Dr. Falsom, sorry.
2432940	2435820	Dr. Falsom, sorry, I forgot.
2435820	2440140	You're such a famed Nobel Prize winner,
2440140	2443540	so you did cure happiness, whatever.
2443540	2444740	I've cured- I've cured-
2444740	2446380	Mad pal disease.
2446380	2448740	Which is the cause of sadness.
2451620	2452620	Very true.
2452620	2455260	I start putting on my hazmat suit.
2455260	2457780	I don't know how well it can be one of these doctors,
2457780	2458660	these medical students,
2458660	2461940	so maybe you guys could teach me some terms.
2461940	2465500	I know the word scalpel, and-
2465500	2467140	Scalpel.
2467140	2470020	I know the word liver,
2470020	2474220	and what other doctor terms could I know?
2475100	2476660	Dorian's like, I think we should just both
2476660	2477860	keep our mouth shut.
2480660	2483500	Now that's exactly what I was gonna propose too.
2483500	2487060	How about Dr. Anne Falser, Falsom?
2488340	2491700	You do the talking. You look at the ID again.
2492300	2495300	Dorian helps Chuck put on his hazmat suit
2495300	2497300	because he gets his hands-
2497300	2498540	He gets his arms tangled,
2498540	2502180	since somehow both arms are in one arm hole.
2502180	2507020	Dorian is starting to find Chuckie a little bit endearing.
2507020	2510900	She's kind of like, okay, I'll take care of you.
2510900	2511740	Pat, pat.
2513060	2515740	Does he remind you of your whippet?
2515740	2517860	He kind of reminds me of my whippet, yes.
2517860	2519580	This is pretty useless.
2519580	2521700	She's like, I don't want my dog on this trip.
2521700	2523860	I might as well just take care of this kid.
2525420	2528180	I start mimicking, she's Pavlov to me,
2528180	2529460	and I start like,
2533900	2534740	Good God.
2535740	2537780	Dr. Miller walks up to Chuck.
2537780	2539460	If there is any weapons, do we have weapons there?
2539460	2542620	You said you would give us anything, right?
2542620	2544460	Oh yeah, what do you find?
2544460	2546740	I would like to find an automatic rifle,
2546740	2548740	or something that deals a lot of damage
2548740	2550300	that Chuck would know how to use.
2550300	2551140	Yeah, absolutely.
2551140	2553260	I also have my go pack, so I'm ready.
2553260	2556180	I got my pistol, I got my knuckle busters,
2556180	2557940	my throwing stars, and my switchblade.
2557940	2559660	If you want to find something
2559660	2561580	that has a little bit more firepower,
2561580	2564140	then there is a rifle in the back.
2564140	2565780	I think Dr. Miller finds something,
2565780	2568900	but she is not able to herself use it,
2568900	2571700	and so she walks over to Chuck, and it's just like,
2571700	2574060	now listen to me carefully, boy.
2574060	2577540	If you see something, if you see something,
2577540	2579500	stop panting, it makes you look dumb.
2581900	2583180	Sorry, ma'am.
2583180	2584100	It's okay.
2584100	2587900	If you see something, I want you to not think,
2587900	2589780	I want you to shoot, okay?
2589780	2591020	The door opens.
2592500	2593340	Oh God.
2593340	2594740	Not that, don't shoot that.
2597460	2599260	I look confused.
2599260	2601740	If you see something that you might find strange,
2601740	2604700	and might attack, I don't know if the other two
2604700	2605740	will be able to do it,
2605740	2610380	but I guess with your quick reactions and presence,
2610380	2613220	I'm sure that you will be the quickest to act.
2613220	2615220	Whatever terrible thing we're gonna see in there,
2615220	2617860	I wanted to not leave this room.
2617860	2621620	Chuck harkens back to his short-lived military days,
2621620	2625380	and really likes having a leader tell him what to do,
2625380	2630140	so he stands in line, mission ready, and says, yes ma'am.
2630140	2631620	You better be ready, Dr. Miller.
2631620	2633340	He's gonna piss in your bed.
2633340	2634180	Yeah.
2635180	2637740	And she's like, oh God, what have I done?
2637740	2641060	I start to pull a beer out of my refrigerator pants,
2641060	2645820	and Dr. Miller slaps it out of my hand.
2645820	2647260	Maybe, if she wants to.
2647260	2648300	Oh, hell yeah.
2648300	2651220	Or she's like, perhaps later, perhaps later.
2651220	2652620	Yes, yes ma'am, yes ma'am.
2653660	2655500	Let's go, yes ma'am.
2655500	2658660	And she taps his shoulder a little harder than necessary,
2658660	2661020	but I'm thinking like maybe he likes the roughness.
2661020	2662860	Yeah, and then he does a little burp.
2663700	2664540	Okay.
2665380	2669860	You truly are a child, like a young infant child.
2672140	2674780	Y'all, I got a question real fast before we go inside.
2674780	2679780	Oh my God, this could just keep happening forever.
2679780	2681700	The getting ready stage.
2684260	2685740	Do you think that Dr. Anne Falsom
2685740	2686780	should have a British accent?
2686780	2688500	I just wonder if they'll believe me more.
2688500	2689540	The front door opens.
2689540	2692500	It's a metal door of this metal corrugated shack,
2693020	2698020	and walking out backwards is seemingly Carl Lambert.
2698180	2702620	He is in his early 40s, and he is slightly overweight,
2702620	2706740	severely balding, wears a dirty tank top,
2706740	2709180	and as he's walking backwards,
2709180	2711700	his love handles on either side
2711700	2715060	are kind of jiggling with each step as he walks backwards,
2715060	2718020	and as your eyes go up to the top of his head,
2718020	2721100	he has a makeshift headband, like a t-shirt,
2721140	2723660	like a ratty old t-shirt that's been ripped,
2723660	2726620	and is now tied around his head.
2726620	2730420	He is talking to the camera that is being run
2730420	2735300	by seemingly Janice Ruth, and then behind her even,
2735300	2739180	you see a man, you can assume this is Agent Dyer,
2739180	2743660	and he is kind of a small, thin man
2743660	2747820	wearing big, thin-rimmed glasses,
2747860	2751340	and Carl Lambert is talking directly to the camera,
2751340	2752260	and he's like,
2753420	2757540	welcome to another Bush product.
2757540	2759300	Hey, what up, Bushheads out there?
2759300	2760620	Everybody wants to come on down,
2760620	2762420	and we got something big for you.
2762420	2763580	I know we say that a lot,
2763580	2765500	and if we get a knock on the wood,
2765500	2768380	or if we get, I mean, the other day,
2768380	2770100	when we had that knock, I swear to God,
2770100	2773780	that is what the, I'm getting ahead of myself.
2773820	2776700	We are going to meet with the one,
2776700	2781460	the only, Dr. Anne Falsom today.
2781460	2783460	You've seen her comment on the messaging board,
2783460	2785140	and you know what she's been up to,
2785140	2787380	and you know that she is the only one
2787380	2790060	we would call if we were to,
2790060	2792060	and then he gets right up into the camera,
2792060	2797060	and he's like, actually find and kill a big fight.
2801460	2802940	It happened!
2802980	2805380	Yes, I am so excited for you.
2805380	2806940	Smash that like and subscribe,
2806940	2808580	comment below when you see this thing.
2808580	2811540	All right, now, let's talk Dr. Anne Falsom here,
2811540	2813140	and let's get into the thing going.
2813140	2815100	And he turns around,
2815100	2817500	camera is still coming towards you guys,
2817500	2820900	and you can kind of hear from behind his weird growl,
2820900	2823660	you hear this camerawoman is just kind of like,
2823660	2828460	hmm, hmm, hmm, just kind of like breathing heavy,
2828460	2832260	you know, just your normal camera person
2832300	2836300	who has something like wheezing in her throat constantly.
2837220	2840540	So if you were to watch Bush videos,
2844540	2846660	then you would be hearing that in the background
2846660	2848300	pretty much the whole time.
2848300	2851300	And she brought her team!
2853460	2855980	He's looking, Carl is looking back and forth
2855980	2859500	between all four of you to see kind of who steps forward.
2859500	2861700	Very frazzled, Rusty quickly decides
2861700	2863980	to go for a British accent, steps forward.
2863980	2866980	Chuck steps forward with her, and then she pushes him back.
2869060	2870980	I shove Chuck back in his place.
2872020	2875660	Hello, my name is Dr. Anne Falsom.
2875660	2878660	Aw, yeah, and you can even tell how smart she is
2878660	2880940	because the way she says words nice.
2880940	2883860	Hey, Dr. Falsom, it is an absolute pleasure
2883860	2886260	to finally meet you on camera.
2886260	2888220	That's correct, it is.
2888220	2889700	Are you channeling Joe Rogan right now?
2889700	2890660	I'm sorry, go on.
2892140	2892980	No!
2892980	2895740	I've never, I haven't seen him since Fear Factor.
2896940	2898180	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
2898180	2899780	You're not a rogue head?
2899780	2901580	I don't know, is that true?
2901580	2902540	I'm a Bush boy.
2906940	2908220	Doctor, doctor, doctor,
2909180	2912300	I know that I said that I promised you a body,
2912300	2916260	and what I have is, I guarantee you,
2916260	2917940	and he looks again at the camera,
2917980	2922980	the first taken and held and killed corpse
2923940	2927380	of a Bigfoot that's ever been found, ever,
2927380	2929220	and we've got it here.
2929220	2932300	Dr. Falsom, what are your thoughts on the situation?
2932300	2934460	First of all, I don't want to be on camera.
2935620	2940060	His eyes turn to pure sadness,
2940980	2943380	and he kind of pushes the camera away.
2943380	2945140	But I thought you were a fan.
2945140	2947220	I prefer to keep my identity private,
2947220	2948780	and my team as well,
2948780	2951460	and I will be the judge of whether or not this is a Bigfoot.
2951460	2953540	Everybody roll alertness.
2956180	2957220	I got a five.
2957220	2959580	Oh, what is your alertness?
2959580	2960420	20%.
2960420	2961820	Oh, then that is a success.
2961820	2965060	For rolling rules, if you're new to Delta Green,
2965060	2968740	if you roll under your skill, then that is a success.
2968740	2973300	So you want to roll as high as possible without going over.
2973300	2974460	Price is right rules.
2974620	2976420	If someone's trying to steal something from you,
2976420	2977860	like in this instance,
2977860	2979420	they would want to roll higher than you
2979420	2981620	in order to succeed.
2981620	2983100	So what did you roll, Taylor?
2983100	2983940	A 43.
2983940	2984780	On a?
2984780	2985620	On an 80.
2985620	2987100	Oh, so that is a success as well.
2987100	2987940	Yeah.
2987940	2989460	Eleanor, what did you roll?
2989460	2992540	An 11, alertness 20, so.
2992540	2994300	And your dice match.
2994300	2995500	Yep.
2995500	2996340	And it's under.
2996340	2998140	All right, so that's our first critical success.
2998140	2998980	So we have our first critical success.
2998980	2999820	Yay!
2999820	3002740	Ooh, all right, nice.
3002740	3003740	Nice.
3003780	3005900	Not that it matters, but Lindsay, what did you roll?
3005900	3007700	Well, I did crit fail.
3007700	3008540	Oh my God.
3011060	3012420	Those beers hit her hard.
3012420	3013500	The beers, yeah.
3013500	3014900	And I'm also just so paranoid.
3014900	3016700	I think I just like don't want to be here at all,
3016700	3019500	but I also really, this is the only thing I'm living for.
3021820	3024060	There's a lot inside of you.
3025620	3027860	It's a mixture of me and my mom in real life.
3029460	3032580	Okay, so with that being said,
3032580	3037580	let's take a quick pause because Discord is messing up.
3037940	3039020	You want me to whistle a song?
3039020	3040180	Yeah, I'd love that.
3040180	3044340	What was it called?
3044340	3046420	It's called a little jig.
3047780	3048860	A jig.
3048860	3049860	That's beautiful.
3049860	3052060	A little jig, yes.
3052060	3053540	A wee little jig.
3053540	3056740	I shush away, but ever jigging me.
3056740	3057860	Oh God.
3057860	3060500	I should have gone with that for my dog accent.
3060500	3061340	I just want to say,
3061340	3063700	if ever given the opportunity to have more than one accent,
3063700	3065540	I will take it.
3065540	3068260	The last time I got to play a fucking shit.
3071460	3072780	Zach, you're doing a great job.
3072780	3074420	I'm losing my mind.
3074420	3076060	You're doing such a good job.
3076060	3077820	Thanks guys, I appreciate that.
3080340	3081660	Quiet on set.
3084860	3086220	Hello.
3086220	3087620	Hello.
3087620	3089020	Lindsay, during Marine,
3089020	3091220	because of the critical fail, roll sanity.
3091220	3092060	Damn it.
3092060	3093540	Yeah.
3093540	3095740	Come on, you stupid ass.
3095740	3098460	Jesus Christ, Doreen is down that ladder.
3101460	3103220	We have a crazy person in our midst.
3103220	3104340	Seven.
3104340	3105580	Oh, success.
3105580	3107380	While this whole conversation is happening
3107380	3109140	about whether or not Dr. Anne Folsom
3109140	3110980	is going to be on camera or not,
3112140	3115940	you turn around and you see yourself
3115980	3120180	in the reflection of the driver's side mirror
3121540	3126540	of this sprinter van and a chill runs down your spine.
3126980	3129660	And right when you think you're about to hear laughter,
3129660	3132220	you're almost fucking expecting it at this point.
3133220	3134900	Nothing happens.
3134900	3138100	And you're just staring at yourself in this reflection.
3138100	3140300	And it's honestly probably the first time in a minute
3140300	3143820	you've been able to just hold eye contact with yourself.
3143860	3148500	And it kind of feels good to see and be seen individually.
3148500	3150340	With your critical success, Eleanor,
3150340	3154740	Dr. Olivia Miller is the only one who notices
3154740	3157620	that Janice Ruth, oh, she's still filming.
3157620	3161340	She may have pointed the camera away from Dr. Anne Folsom,
3161340	3163660	but she did not stop recording.
3163660	3166060	All right, yeah, no, I understand, I understand.
3166060	3168420	It's just that I really thought you were a fan.
3168420	3171860	And I thought that the whole point of you coming out here
3171860	3175420	was gonna be that you were going to be on camera
3175420	3177060	talking about the body.
3177060	3178420	Well, we're talking about science.
3178420	3181460	So I need to step inside and take a look at the situation
3181460	3183860	before I allow anyone to record anything.
3183860	3186100	Okay, so can we try this again?
3186100	3190340	But it's just me, but then I'll let you see the body.
3190340	3194740	And then after that, then you'll be on camera.
3194740	3197180	I don't know, I need to be let inside.
3197180	3198980	You're wasting our time.
3198980	3200620	Nice.
3200620	3201580	Roll persuade.
3201580	3203220	Please.
3203220	3205260	I got a 94 on a 20.
3207540	3210300	I mean, I suppose, can't Dr. Miller step in?
3210300	3211180	Oh yeah, absolutely.
3211180	3213500	Especially since Dr. Miller critically succeeded
3213500	3217540	and notices that Janice Ruth is still recording.
3217540	3221220	So you can use that kind of maybe as leverage here.
3221220	3224460	Excuse me, Dr. Anne Folsom did say specifically
3224460	3225980	that she did not wanna be on camera.
3225980	3228780	And yet I see that you're still recording.
3228780	3230060	Is that how we're going to work here?
3230060	3232660	Is that what we do as friends?
3233700	3235940	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
3235940	3238980	I didn't, I didn't, I didn't notice.
3238980	3242380	And she's like fumbling her thumb for the record button.
3242380	3245140	She's like, I really, I didn't know.
3245140	3246660	Are you all right?
3246660	3247500	Yeah, I'm fine.
3247500	3249340	Can I roll like a first aid or something
3249340	3251420	to see what the hell, like see what's going on with her?
3251420	3252380	Yeah, absolutely.
3252380	3253500	You can roll a first aid.
3253500	3255300	First aid or is that, does that make sense?
3255300	3257820	Maybe not first aid, but like medicine, medicine.
3257820	3259180	Yeah, medicine works, yeah.
3259220	3260780	Whichever one you have more of.
3262060	3264260	52 on a 60, so who?
3264260	3265340	Ooh, nice.
3265340	3269700	So you would know that Janice Ruth has health issues,
3269700	3272180	specifically maybe some untreated asthma.
3272180	3275260	Okay, so this is not something to be that worried about.
3275260	3278700	No, she's just very stressed out and excited.
3278700	3281660	And she's also really worried seemingly
3281660	3283920	that she did something bad.
3283920	3287540	You're getting onto her, which she's not used to.
3287580	3291700	And she's just like, I'm sorry, I didn't know.
3291700	3292660	It's okay.
3292660	3295580	I was just trying, I was just trying.
3295580	3296820	Calm down, just calm down.
3296820	3300300	So you see her click it off and the camera's off.
3300300	3303940	All right, all right, yeah, come on in, come on in.
3303940	3308820	We've just been doing, you know, some photo shoots,
3308820	3311420	I guess, with the body.
3311420	3314100	It's actually laying on the pool table.
3314140	3315580	So come on in.
3315580	3318620	And you see, as you guys are turning back
3318620	3321160	and looking at this one door shack,
3321160	3324960	one room, one door, corrugated metal room.
3324960	3327980	Jerome Dyer, this small thin man
3327980	3331700	wearing these large glasses with thin frames
3331700	3334540	is just kind of leaning up against the corrugated metal
3334540	3336340	next to the door.
3336340	3337220	Hello?
3337220	3338120	Who are you?
3338120	3340520	Jerome, you can just call me Jerome.
3340520	3342960	You know me, Bush, Dr. Anfalsom.
3343800	3348080	Yes, I do know you very well.
3348080	3349780	You both fucking wink at each other,
3349780	3352280	like enormous winks, like huge winks.
3353480	3355840	Oh, I know who you are.
3357440	3359680	And then I'm like, no, shut up, shut up.
3359680	3360520	Oh, right, right, right, right.
3360520	3362020	And then I just put a fist out.
3364080	3367640	He like taps on it with one finger
3367640	3370100	and is like testing one, two.
3370100	3373120	Ha, ha, ha, ha, nice to meet you.
3374300	3375260	That was so dope.
3376580	3377580	This guy's funny.
3379060	3381700	I just walk inside, cause I'm over the bullshit.
3381700	3382600	I'm coming with her.
3382600	3383660	Everybody going inside?
3383660	3385500	Yeah, I wanna see this thing.
3385500	3386340	Chuckster.
3386340	3387160	Chuckster.
3387160	3388000	You going inside?
3388000	3389540	Hell yeah, bro.
3389540	3391380	There he is, there he is.
3393700	3396820	Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna waver between country boy and.
3396820	3399180	It just depends on who's talking to you.
3401020	3403340	Chuckster, the code switch king.
3403340	3408140	All right, so you guys all need to roll sanity.
3408140	3408980	Oh, fuck.
3413180	3414820	I got a 41 on a 56.
3415820	3416860	That is a success.
3416860	3420020	I got a 54 on a 56.
3421940	3424860	That is also, the doctors have succeeded.
3424860	3428080	I got a 10 on a 60.
3428080	3429620	Also a success.
3430100	3430940	52 on a 40.
3430940	3431780	Oh no.
3431780	3434540	And there's the fail, there's the fail.
3434540	3436540	This is not what you were expecting
3436540	3439300	and it's also not good.
3439300	3441740	So even though you passed,
3441740	3443860	the three of you who rolled under your sanity
3443860	3447420	still lose one sanity.
3448540	3449380	Chuckster.
3449380	3450200	Yep.
3450200	3452300	No article for you this time.
3452300	3453140	You.
3453140	3453960	Serious.
3453960	3458600	You are going to roll a D4,
3458600	3460480	which is the pyramid.
3460480	3462940	And then you are going to add one
3462940	3465320	and you are going to lose that many sanity.
3466720	3468200	Four.
3468200	3470000	Rolled a, rolled a big old four.
3471640	3474160	So I lose five sanity, I'm now at 35.
3474160	3475000	Jesus.
3475000	3476440	There's a thing that happens in this game
3476440	3478320	when you lose five sanity.
3478320	3479480	As you guys all know,
3479480	3483160	and pretending to be people when you lose one sanity,
3483200	3484960	you have to do a shot of hard liquor
3484960	3487000	when you lose two to three sanity,
3487000	3488360	you have to rip a bong,
3488360	3490000	and then anything past that,
3490000	3491360	you have to do a fat line.
3494880	3497440	Ellie, if you'll open the package that we sent you.
3498400	3500240	I was like, I'm trying to lose some sanity.
3500240	3501080	Yeah, but also guys,
3501080	3502220	you have so much money,
3502220	3504120	like being able to send cocaine.
3506120	3507920	It's what all the Patreon money.
3508840	3513760	When you lose five sanity in Delta Green,
3513760	3517800	what happens is that you have a temporary break from reality
3517800	3522120	in which you react in an uncontrollable way.
3522120	3526240	So you are either going to fight, fight.
3526240	3527380	What did I say first?
3527380	3528220	Fight.
3528220	3529040	Fight.
3529040	3529880	Fight.
3529880	3530720	Or fight.
3532560	3535720	What I was wanting to do was I'm frozen,
3535760	3539680	but I'm just going cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
3539680	3541760	Okay, normally you would roll,
3541760	3543720	but I think that that's really funny.
3543720	3545280	So we're going to go with that.
3548320	3551120	You can kind of like look at the face.
3551120	3553600	I think the camera is just hitting the face
3553600	3556720	of Charles Chuck, the Chuck Steer Chuck,
3556720	3558520	as he's doing cool, cool.
3558520	3561200	And then the camera kind of slowly pans around
3561200	3565360	until we can see what all of you are looking at,
3565360	3570200	which is this corpse that is on the pool table laid out.
3570200	3575200	This corpse is not the corpse of a Bigfoot, however.
3578000	3579720	It's a child.
3579720	3583880	It's a wrinkled corpse of a child,
3583880	3587320	completely covered in dark purple bruises.
3587320	3588980	Seems to be a preteen.
3590240	3593300	This thing is riddled with holes
3593300	3596580	from 12 gauge shotgun slugs.
3596580	3601460	Blood has been pouring from these holes onto the pool table,
3601460	3606460	which has a tarp down that the blood is pooling onto.
3606460	3610140	And this bruised body just sits lifeless.
3611020	3614200	For those of you who only lost one sanity,
3614200	3616920	you see the eyes of Carl Lambert
3616920	3618780	as they fill up with tears.
3623300	3625220	Michael, what the fuck?
3633540	3634380	For a moment.
3634380	3635220	Oh, that's the end of the episode.
3635220	3636060	What?
3636060	3638880	I want to say, hooch is in deep.
3643460	3644300	Amazing.
3645940	3648380	Fine, I'll save that joke for later.
3650060	3652020	Maybe for not this scene.
3652940	3654380	Dear God.
3654380	3655320	Wow.
3655320	3656220	Shit.
3656220	3657140	That was really cool.
3657140	3657980	So that's the end of episode two.
3657980	3660100	That was really cool, thank you.
3660100	3661580	Thanks for playing.
3661580	3666580	For, I was not sure if that was what they knew was there
3666940	3669900	until the Carl Lambert moment.
3669900	3671180	And then I was like, fuck.
3671180	3672020	I have theories.
3672020	3673740	Maybe I'll save it for air,
3673740	3676100	but I have theories of what's going on.
3676100	3678600	See rings of deafening people.
3682180	3685020	You don't know where you found it.
3686700	3690200	In this state as your eyes fall short,
3692380	3695040	you better learn how to keep it.
3712020	3717020	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3717980	3720900	Clasp your fist over all the blood.
3723860	3726620	Water leaks through your fingers.
3728300	3731300	You're standing in a swirling flood.
3734140	3736480	And only darkness leads you.
3742020	3742860	Ooh.
3759660	3762080	Falling fast into deep abyss.
3765540	3767880	Till it tears you out again.
3767880	3770960	Find your feet on your broken bones.
3774000	3776160	Clear out the edge again.
3797880	3800960	You're standing in a swirling flood.
3827880	3830960	You're standing in a swirling flood.
3857880	3860960	You're standing in a swirling flood.
3887880	3890960	You're standing in a swirling flood.
3917880	3920960	You're standing in a swirling flood.
3947880	3951120	You're standing in a swirling flood.
3977880	3980960	You're standing in a swirling flood.
