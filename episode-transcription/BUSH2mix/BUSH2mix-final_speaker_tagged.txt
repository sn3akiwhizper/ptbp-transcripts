0.00 15.86 speaker0  This is yet another introduction to a show that you listen to called, well it's broadcast live
12.94 195.84 speaker1  with the gross wolf the dog. This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Ash and tagged that pretending pod, which is a nice thing to do. I listen every day while I'm at work and it passes the time so fast, my job feels almost inconsequential. Almost as if the atrocities I've committed don't affect me. As if I can't hear the violent snapping of tendons and viscera emanating from my monitor. A mere taste of the despair that lies and keep up the great work. Hmm, nightmare network? Did you just try to sneak in promotion for another media channel that isn't my radio station on my radio station? at you, for sure. If you wanna write up something for your wolf to howl, tag us on the internet or fuck the zuck, but preferably write us a five star review on your podcast listening application. the never missed scientist. Her ex was pissed, you get the gist. Dr. Olivia Miller, the sad single mom surgeon. Her daughter saw her dissect some sort of a extra dimensional creature out of a screaming woman's neck and it shot into a sir's snot socket who was promptly shot in the skull by his sorrowful sidekick, full stop. Next, Doreen Maureen. Scroll Pinterest on that iPad, that's a good haiku. Finally, the step motherfucker himself, the Chuckster. Coming in at five foot seven, 213 pounds of round muscle that is. It's ball buster 420, hell yeah. And he survived the holy suffocating, holy decapitating tongue from hell. Well, it's time for the briefing. Yep, you can hear that creeping. If your ears aren't leaking, it's Molly Healy with circles. See ring star, deafening heaps.
193.00 218.04 speaker2  You don't know where you found it. In this state, as your eyes fall short, Welcome to Pretending to Be People.
215.12 239.04 speaker3  on episode one, part one of this story. It is now part two. Let's go around the room as well as the TV. Eleanor is on a TV on our kitchen countertop here. We'll take a group photo at the end of this with us and the TV.
238.20 244.40 speaker2  Oh, that's right. Oh, sorry.
242.04 258.20 speaker3  And you can put up a picture of yourself. Yeah, perfect.
257.36 271.72 speaker0  You sell it. Ellie on the kitchen counter, the nudes. No, okay.
268.92 273.52 speaker3  I've been trying, Eleanor, but-
271.72 275.48 speaker0  Dude, more feet, more feet.
273.52 278.20 speaker3  Oh, okay, yeah.
275.48 280.96 speaker0  More feet in this audio podcast.
278.20 298.16 speaker3  Oh no, they want to see it, they want to see it. your character's name, and then the worst thought you've ever had about your mom. So let's start with Allie. Ooh, can't wait. My name's Allie.
294.96 317.88 speaker0  My character name is Rusty Hooch, Dr. Hooch. The worst thought I've ever had about my mom is that I'm exactly like her. Really?
317.04 323.60 speaker3  Hi, Jen. My mom won't listen.
322.76 348.64 speaker0  I'm Lindsay. I play Doreen, Maureen, or Chlorine, or Boreen, or whatever you want to call me. First name, Doreen. And the worst thought I've had about my mom is probably that I based this character off of her.
346.80 353.72 speaker3  I have Facebook here. It's like, I'll tweet at it. No, I'm probably not. Because she definitely has a Facebook. Pinterest. Pinterest.
352.24 430.92 speaker0  You can just DM her on Pinterest. That's the most definite way to get a hold of her. What's up? Hi, I'm Eleanor DiLorenzo, and I play Dr. Olivia Miller. And do you want to know the best thoughts I've had about your mom, Zach? OK, actually, I don't know anything about your mom. But what's her, never mind. We're not going to go down this road. You're going to dox my mom? I'm not going to dox your mom, no. I'm sure she's a lovely lady. Most American ladies I've met are super kind and sweet. So I'm sure she's great. My mom, on the other hand, what a, no. oh, shit, yeah, I don't know. I feel like you can't talk shit about your mom if you have a good mom, because moms are the best. So I feel bad about even considering like the list of awful things. she made like a pretty nasty chicken tikka masala.
428.72 435.56 speaker4  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
430.92 445.12 speaker0  So, yeah, that's the worst mom thought I've had. And Taylor?
440.40 447.96 speaker4  My character name is Chuck Cheese. Oh, yeah?
447.12 450.84 speaker3  Charles Cheese. You're going with Charles the Chuckster Cheese?
449.88 462.88 speaker4  Charles the Chuckster Cheese. Charles Chuckster Cheese. OK, anyway.
461.24 464.36 speaker3  My mother-in-law rules, so.
462.88 492.16 speaker4  I will say, though, I've had time to think about this because I was the last one to go. And when I was a kid, I would walk to and from school and elementary school. And if I was mad at my mom, I would intentionally Yeah, actually, yeah, she had to get a breast reduction because her boobs are so big it hurt her back.
489.92 494.84 speaker0  by stepping on the cracks?
492.16 506.40 speaker4  Yeah, every time it's like a Pinocchio. They just grew and grew.
500.76 511.72 speaker0  And I was like, give me those titties.
508.80 526.28 speaker4  And I had a lot of sleepovers as a kid. And after my mom got the surgery, any time my friend came over, she was like, look. And just lift up her shirt and show her smaller scarred boobs. Do they shape them?
525.76 536.32 speaker0  They do. So they look like perky nice titties, huh?
534.80 538.00 speaker4  So Zach, are you really happy we're
536.32 550.02 speaker0  talking about your mother-in-law's boobs on your podcast? boobs?
549.30 613.82 speaker3  until you finished. So my thought about mom's boobs. When I was 17, my birthday landed on Easter Sunday. And so the whole family came over on my birthday after church. I'd been going camping with my friends a lot. And so my mom got me a camping chair, a really nice one, because I used to borrow their camping chairs. This was her really nice way of being like, stop fucking taking my camping chairs. So she bought me my own. And I was so stoked, actually. I was like, this is rad. This is great. It's huge. It was like a big one. And she's like, yeah, it's oversized. So it can actually hold up to 250 pounds, to her very chunky young boy.
612.42 614.94 speaker4  Self-conscious son.
613.82 621.42 speaker3  Yeah, yeah. It is a captain's chair, extra large, oversized.
620.18 626.58 speaker4  For oversized boys.
624.46 629.18 speaker3  and White Rum.
626.58 630.90 speaker2  All right, so let's dive into it.
630.02 637.38 speaker0  Oh, right, actually. I was going to tangentally about the topic. I don't even know how to say tangentally. You know what I'm talking about. Tangent.
636.54 640.10 speaker4  Yeah. OK. One more. One more.
638.98 694.58 speaker0  I want to. One more boob. No, no, it's not about boobs, but it's about cool women. I have a cool story about my aunt. Men in her family would take off their shirts very often when it was in the summer months in Sweden, because that's socially acceptable for men to wear their boobs out. But even at the dinner table, she's like, please put on a shirt. And they're like, fuck off. Maybe not. They didn't say that, but maybe something similar to that. And so one day, she was like, OK. And I'm like, that's my goal in life. No one will know. No one will know, guys. It's an audio drama. I don't know.
691.38 697.70 speaker4  Maybe it will be funnier, just more vulnerable. Just do sounds with taking your turn off.
696.70 702.06 speaker0  Make for better audio.
700.82 704.42 speaker4  Ding-dong. Ding-dong-dong-dong-dong.
703.90 727.22 speaker3  I get it. I understand. All right, let's dive into this episode. Yeah. I think we got a pretty good introduction to your characters The way in which the game works is now going to change, because we're going to put you all in the same place and then send you on a little mission.
726.62 739.34 speaker4  OK. OK.
736.66 1013.22 speaker3  had your unnatural encounters that brought you into Delta Green. And here you are again, going into the field with three strangers sitting in the back of a Sprinter van turned into a mobile lab in the parking lot of a public park with no cameras in Shreveport, Mississippi at 2,200 He's super intense. He's leaning into all of you as he talks. as an intelligence analyst. During his second night at the opera, he left. He abandoned his post. And he joined a group called Bigfoot Underground Search and Hunt. He's been radio silent for three years until tonight. Falsom. And this guy looks super proud of himself when he says this. Agent Dyer is desperately seeking extraction, but not for him. For a body, a big body, from an isolated cabin in the thick, verdant hills of southwest Arkansas near a small town called Fook. I've pinned the location on these clean phones. with various used cases on them. The cases are so that the phone doesn't get shattered, Ali. Search and Hunt while portraying this Dr. Ann Falsom. And the origin story of their ringleader, Carl Lambert, is fucking tragic. Check this out. When he was 14 years old, he went out camping with his dad and his younger brother Michael, who was 12 at the time. So this Bigfoot sneaks into their camp in the night and abducts the younger brother. but who's going to believe them? Everyone just assumed the dad killed the boy and pressured Carl into telling the Bigfoot story. with a very singular mission. Find Bigfoot and kill it. It's been three decades, but it seems like he finally did it. Again, GPS marked in those phones. They have cases on them, don't worry. We can't have, obviously, we can't have this getting out. up there. So Carl and Janice won't be able to post anything unless they figure out what he's up to. Oh, Janice Ruth, their third musketeer, she's a conservation agent, mostly hunts down poachers. She keeps her identity hidden from most of the Bigfoot underground search and hunt fan base. They'd probably deem her untrustworthy, right, because she works for the man. Bless you. He takes another huge rip off of La Croix. Ruth considers her bachelor's degree in zoology essentially worthless compared to her countless hours spent learning everything there is to know about Bigfoot ecology, behavior, migration on the YouTube channels of her perceived peers. Shit. Sorry, that's so much information. He looks at his watch and waggles his eyebrows. Dr. Anne Falsom, with quotes, should be getting on her way. But that's one of you, obviously. One of you has to be Dr. Anne Falsom when you get there to secure the body, right? Because I've told you that's the whole deal, right? Real quick, do you guys have any questions?
1012.74 1021.98 speaker2  Yeah.
1018.30 1043.46 speaker0  We are dealing with a conspiracy theorist, I'm assuming. Someone who believes in Bigfoot, and we're here to look into a body. I don't know what this could possibly be, obviously, based on this description I was given. Yeah, it's a Bigfoot. OK. That's why we got two of the smallest.
1041.74 1049.38 speaker3  Are you still going by? The juxtaposer.
1046.50 1075.06 speaker4  So honored to be in the presence of such righteous ladies. Fuck. Very. fought a lot of not-so-good guys, All right.
1070.86 1083.54 speaker0  her revolver she has in her pants, stuck to the top of the way in her pants because she's like, guess I will be protecting myself for the rest of the day.
1082.54 1090.22 speaker4  What's the range on that? Can I hold it?
1088.78 1092.02 speaker0  I mean, we just met.
1091.30 1098.62 speaker4  I understand. I understand.
1096.86 1102.62 speaker0  Or is that Ellie, who has no idea what? I know nothing about guns, but.
1102.02 1116.06 speaker4  OK, good.
1108.22 1143.94 speaker3  normally when someone's like, I pull out my M6942K AK-47 into that side of Delta Green. So gun, shoot, pew pew.
1139.02 1168.82 speaker4  Doreen is like somewhere in between the Chuckster and the intelligence of these two doctors. So she's just kind of taking it all in. She knows that she, as an agent, has more capability than the Chuckster, but is not going to say anything. It's just going to be, you know, she'll let the Chuckster think. Chuckster is just raw confidence. That's what he works on. And that's fine.
1167.78 1175.82 speaker0  That's fine with Doreen.
1173.14 1182.18 speaker3  back and forth between these two groups, these intelligent doctors.
1180.02 1214.14 speaker4  assuming she's going to see children somewhere. Anyone want a brewski? I keep them in my refrigerator pack pant pockets. You see, I invented a mechanism you can put in pants with their insulated pockets and ice packs so I can always keep my beers cold. What's your name again? I think maybe you'll just want to call me Charles. It's late at night.
1213.14 1218.94 speaker3  It's 2,200.
1217.14 1228.86 speaker4  Get that brewski away from me. Doreen takes him up on the offer.
1226.22 1239.90 speaker0  She's like, a wearable fridge.
1238.98 1246.26 speaker4  All right.
1242.94 1251.22 speaker0  And maybe I'll take you up on that offer later. We'll see how tonight goes.
1249.58 1331.74 speaker3  So I'm going to get the fuck out of here. You guys need to get going. They expect Ann to be, Dr. Falsom, sorry, to be up there soon. So whoever wants it can have it. And he throws down four IDs on this table. And you're in a Sprinter van, right? But it's been transformed into a lab in the back. So there is almost like an ambulance. There's going to be a stretcher in the middle. So you guys are kind of sitting on either side of this stretcher. And he slams down four IDs. They all say, Dr. Ann Falsom, they have each of your pictures on. So he's like, your choice. Whoever wants to take lead on it can do it. But I got to get out of here. My number is in those clean cells, right? So once you have the body, shoot me a call. The second location that's in those phones, GPS, is going to be the drop off point. So I've got a warehouse. I'll meet you there after the mission is up. So I have all the faith in you that I should. You're very intelligent. You're very capable. He looks at two different groups when he says those things. And that'll be it for me. I'm going to get going. And he kind of opens up the back doors of this Sprinter van
1330.82 1332.70 speaker4  to be picked up.
1331.74 1340.74 speaker3  He turns back around.
1340.26 1345.74 speaker4  All right.
1342.94 1364.62 speaker3  You hear a truck start on the other side of the parking lot. And it swings by and picks him up. And the truck heads out. You are now, the four of you, alone, I mean, with three strangers, in the back of this converted mobile lab slash mobile ambulance kind of thing that just looks like a standard Sprinter
1361.74 1377.66 speaker4  van on the outside. But I don't know that I'm so much the doctor type. So maybe someone wants to take lead on being that doctor.
1376.38 1379.42 speaker0  None of y'all can handle it.
1377.66 1383.98 speaker4  You do seem real right smart. And I like them bangs, girl.
1382.82 1399.78 speaker0  Stay away from me.
1397.70 1407.62 speaker3  Allie to explain something real quick.
1403.86 1419.06 speaker2  What do you even mean, Zach?
1415.78 1423.14 speaker3  going into creating a character for being on the show again?
1421.54 1439.38 speaker4  First time I played a straight man. The second time I played a closeted lesbian. At the time, I was identifying as straight. I am now playing an out lesbian and am an out lesbian.
1437.38 1449.46 speaker2  So I'm going to be a pilot next.
1448.54 1458.10 speaker4  That's so terrible. It's actually the only reason she became a lesbian. There's a cover for that.
1455.42 1470.98 speaker2  That's my testimony from being on pretending to be people. I became gay.
1469.66 1542.70 speaker3  You guys have this information. You know that it is called Bigfoot Underground Search and Hunt. The ringleader's name is Carl Lambert. The other two people helping out with Bigfoot Underground Search and Hunt are Janice Ruth, who is a conservation agent and Bigfoot expert, and an undercover Delta Green agent named Jerome Dyer, who has been in the field now for three years working with this group. So clearly, he saw something early on with him that showed him, I need to stick with these people and make sure nothing crazy happens because they seem to be onto something. So Dr. Rusty Hooch picks up this ID that's got her face on it, her bangs, and the name Dr. Ann Falsom. You can be anyone you want. You can present yourselves as whatever kind of team you would like. But this is just a way to get through the front gate, if you will, a way to get in the door.
1538.14 1551.38 speaker4  So Dr. Ann Falsom's credentials are she is a, sorry, medical doctor?
1547.78 1580.06 speaker3  quote unquote, this hand letter as Dr. Ann Falsom has been posting comments and DMing back and forth with the Bigfoot Underground Search and Hunt YouTube page. Yes, because she would be the obvious first choice to call upon finding an actual body so that they can have someone who is respected, quote unquote, in the field to present their discovery.
1576.14 1585.30 speaker0  What are the skills they would expect from this Dr. Falsom, whatever her name is?
1580.98 1610.26 speaker3  They want her to come in and be like, yes, this is Bigfoot. They want her to probably name it scientifically, right? And then just be there standing, like a product that is for sale, but no one wants to buy it. So they have a doctor come on the screen and be like, I'm a doctor.
1606.90 1624.26 speaker0  as this pretend doctor and say, I'll be your second in command then. I'll support you. Are we like med students? Yeah, we're part of the team. I think to make it more believable,
1621.38 1638.02 speaker4  like here to offer hands. Yeah, that sounds good. a lot of mixed emotions right now
1634.94 1661.02 speaker2  except for Dr. Miller, who she's extremely intimidated by. And it's pretty clear that Dr. Miller is smarter than me. So that's why she chose to grab that ID first. But she is getting a little anxious about it now because she actually doesn't believe in Bigfoot and has no idea what she's about to get into. I wonder if Dr. Miller senses that.
1656.58 1669.14 speaker0  And she's just like, no, show us the way. I'm sure it will be fine. And then like, rinse. She grins and can see like her teeth,
1667.14 1678.98 speaker2  like in a very predatory way, like.
1678.14 1687.50 speaker0  Who's driving? I'll drive.
1685.74 1701.66 speaker4  or the Livmeister? Like what terms are we on here? Dr. Miller is fine, thank you.
1699.54 1834.70 speaker3  boonies of Arkansas. So when you guys are driving through Arkansas, it is late at night. You're coming up on, let's see, 2230, 2330. So it's around 11.15 PM. You're 15 minutes out from the destination. And you're driving through the mountains and you're driving through the mountains You're 15 minutes out from the destination and you start hitting windy turns deep into the woods. You haven't seen a gas station or any business And you're not sure that there's anyone, any business that is further into these woods. Every once in a while, you'll see a small house or a trailer deep kind of hidden in the woods on either side of the road, that is it's like a archway of trees and thick branches. You're in a part of the country where you'd feel fairly uncomfortable if this Sprinter van were to break down. And as you get toward it, you're starting to lose cell signal. And you remember that your handler mentioned Jerome Dyer, Agent Dyer was sabotaging the cell signal up here that they've taken can get out. So as you're losing signal, your dot begins to just kind of float and there are no more roads on the screen, but you can kind of make out where you are in relation to where the dot that you're headed toward is. And eventually you see a mailbox in the darkness, your headlights lighting it up. And there's a road that leads off to the left gravel road with a gate, a red metal gate.
1832.86 1837.62 speaker2  We got to go back, I'm sorry.
1836.62 1842.14 speaker4  What do you got to check on? It doesn't matter, it's my own personal business.
1840.78 1852.82 speaker2  can we just come back in an hour? I mean, these people have been out here, what, three years? They can wait another hour.
1849.94 1893.30 speaker4  Doreen who is driving does not say anything and just keeps driving. It's like solid as a rock. That'd be fine. Rusty, maybe you and I can have a side adventure. You and I can walk back together, find that cell service. If you look at me one more time. Maybe become best friends. Fasty lady. I don't know, I like that.
1889.26 1928.34 speaker0  listening to Chucky and Rusty going back and forth and then she's like, we could be as quick as possible so we can get back as soon as possible, but I think we should head on. I mean, we're here on a mission. I know they've been out here for three years, but I've seen some things to worry that there might be more of an emergency. I just want to take a look at it and then I'll make sure that you get back in time for whatever phone call it is that you have to make. Dr. Hooch is extremely intimidated
1926.10 1935.98 speaker4  I think we're going to be best friends. I sure hope so.
1932.30 1955.38 speaker3  Chuckster, you noticed that there is a file that is sitting on the counter space, you know, next to one of the chairs here in the back of this mobile lab. And when you pop it open, it's got a little bit more information about the mission, including a code for the gate.
1953.30 1966.50 speaker4  and it seems like it's got a bunch of information. It's very possible.
1963.14 1973.62 speaker3  after going pretty hard, like excited bro.
1972.30 1975.78 speaker4  I love it so much.
1973.62 1991.18 speaker3  When you got into Mississippi and Arkansas,
1988.90 1994.26 speaker4  when I try to do an accent. I just have the one.
1992.30 2002.34 speaker2  I snatched the paper from Chuck because I say, give me this. You don't, you probably don't even know how to read. Let me see this.
1999.06 2010.90 speaker4  Yeah, you write after, I'm not very smart man. I'm not very smart man.
2008.22 2023.94 speaker3  just stoked to be like, hey, what up, what up? How you living like?
2022.30 2031.26 speaker4  Honored to be in their presence.
2028.10 2057.46 speaker0  And so she starts writing down on her cell phone without cell service. She's starting to write down a note for her daughter. So just like, if I don't survive, And then your asshole father has the rest of the money stashed away somewhere else.
2055.02 2066.06 speaker4  She reaches back and grabs another beer. She's just stressed. She grabs another beer out of the pocket of Chuckie's pants
2065.22 2135.30 speaker3  As you pull up to this gate, you see it's an alpha numerical keyboard that you're looking at. It literally looks like an old, that is like the clear blue, colorful keyboard that is like almost duct taped to a stick that's been shoved into the ground and there are wires coming out of it and then going down toward the ground. And then you kind of see the wires above ground going toward this big rusty red gate. The code is Bush. They call themselves Bush. Oh, it took a long time to hit that H, huh?
2131.78 2145.18 speaker4  Doreen is, she might be a little bit above the- A little faded. Yeah, she's a little faded.
2144.34 2156.10 speaker3  Beeee! Beeee!
2154.70 2166.62 speaker2  It finally stops. In an open position.
2165.78 2206.22 speaker3  Yeah. where there are trees climbing on either side and then meeting above the driveway. It's a long gravel driveway that goes uphill and then seems to make a slight dogwood left where you see that there's a clearing and lights are coming from a small one room corrugated sheet metal type just room that has been laid on maybe not even a legit foundation.
2205.26 2213.46 speaker4  Okay. And then it's like shoddily put together so there's like light coming through cracks.
2212.62 2235.94 speaker3  Yes. All right. And there's one streetlight that like, it looks like they might've literally stolen a public streetlight and then moved it up by this shack and the light is shining down on a truck Oh, there's shitloads of stuff in the van.
2235.10 2242.02 speaker2  Okay. Weapons.
2239.34 2267.98 speaker3  anything you might find in an ambulance. I like to, because you're up against such insurmountable odds, I wanna give you everything you need to try to fight back. is probably in there and that's just a nice way to know that you're fucked.
2264.94 2301.22 speaker0  like if there's any protective gear, masks, anything of just like assuming that they're gonna go into a fucking shit show of, I don't know. She's very paranoid at this point. And she's assuming that all these dumb asses will do the same but then she realizes maybe that none of them are doing it or I don't know what they are doing but she's just like, oh, perhaps we should, like she's trying to be polite but then like, oh no.
2296.34 2377.78 speaker4  and like opening cabinets, like rifling through. Like, what's this? Oh, dope. Doreen is just like rolling her eyes at Chucky and like grabbing her weapons that she just of course has on her as an agent and just putting them in the back of the van, getting ready to put the hazmat suit on and Chucky is just staring with his mouth open at all of the weapons she has. And then she just is staring back at him while she's slowly pulling up her hazmat suit. Liver. Pretty sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I got throwing stars. I think it's time. I pull them out and then they're engraved. I have C. Oh, C. Cheese. Cheese! Okay, change my mind. Engraved in each of them is just like- Just cheese. A cheddar. A block of cheddar. Yeah, chunk of cheddar. Yeah.
2376.94 2382.30 speaker3  It's very good.
2380.18 2390.98 speaker4  Don't pull those out, please.
2387.70 2411.58 speaker2  and she's really fascinated by how professional she's being. So she is sort of trying to imitate it, immediately starts putting on a hazmat suit as well, also starts putting on gloves and things. but she's like kinda leaning forward so that Dr. Miller will see that she's like taking it seriously now.
2408.54 2424.30 speaker0  and then she turns around to the other two. He's just like, whenever you're ready, we shall have Dr. Hooch lead the way. Dr.
2422.62 2432.94 speaker4  Actually- Dr. Anne. What's your name? Falsom. What's your name? Falsom. Anne Falsom. Falsom.
2430.74 2455.26 speaker0  Oh, right, no, Dr. Falsom, sorry. Dr. Falsom, sorry, I forgot. You're such a famed Nobel Prize winner, so you did cure happiness, whatever. I've cured- I've cured-
2452.62 2483.50 speaker4  I start putting on my hazmat suit. I don't know how well it can be one of these doctors, these medical students, so maybe you guys could teach me some terms. I know the word scalpel, and- Scalpel. I know the word liver, Dorian's like, I think we should just both keep our mouth shut.
2480.66 2495.30 speaker0  Now that's exactly what I was gonna propose too. You do the talking. You look at the ID again.
2492.30 2537.78 speaker4  Dorian helps Chuck put on his hazmat suit because he gets his hands- He gets his arms tangled, since somehow both arms are in one arm hole. Dorian is starting to find Chuckie a little bit endearing. She's kind of like, okay, I'll take care of you. Pat, pat. I start mimicking, she's Pavlov to me, and I start like,
2535.74 2557.94 speaker0  Dr. Miller walks up to Chuck. If there is any weapons, do we have weapons there? or something that deals a lot of damage that Chuck would know how to use. I also have my go pack, so I'm ready.
2556.18 2561.58 speaker4  my throwing stars, and my switchblade.
2559.66 2568.90 speaker3  that has a little bit more firepower, then there is a rifle in the back.
2565.78 2583.18 speaker0  but she is not able to herself use it, and so she walks over to Chuck, and it's just like, If you see something, if you see something, stop panting, it makes you look dumb.
2581.90 2591.02 speaker4  Sorry, ma'am. It's okay.
2589.78 2594.74 speaker3  The door opens.
2593.34 2625.38 speaker0  Not that, don't shoot that. I look confused. If you see something that you might find strange, and might attack, I don't know if the other two will be able to do it, but I guess with your quick reactions and presence, I'm sure that you will be the quickest to act. Whatever terrible thing we're gonna see in there, I wanted to not leave this room.
2621.62 2633.34 speaker4  and really likes having a leader tell him what to do,
2631.62 2637.74 speaker3  He's gonna piss in your bed.
2635.18 2645.82 speaker0  And she's like, oh God, what have I done?
2641.06 2651.22 speaker4  and Dr. Miller slaps it out of my hand.
2648.30 2652.62 speaker0  Or she's like, perhaps later, perhaps later.
2651.22 2661.02 speaker4  Yes, yes ma'am, yes ma'am. Let's go, yes ma'am.
2658.66 2685.74 speaker0  but I'm thinking like maybe he likes the roughness.
2684.26 2692.50 speaker2  Do you think that Dr. Anne Falsom should have a British accent? I just wonder if they'll believe me more.
2689.54 2863.98 speaker3  It's a metal door of this metal corrugated shack, and walking out backwards is seemingly Carl Lambert. He is in his early 40s, and he is slightly overweight, severely balding, wears a dirty tank top, and as he's walking backwards, his love handles on either side are kind of jiggling with each step as he walks backwards, and as your eyes go up to the top of his head, he has a makeshift headband, like a t-shirt, like a ratty old t-shirt that's been ripped, and is now tied around his head. He is talking to the camera that is being run by seemingly Janice Ruth, and then behind her even, you see a man, you can assume this is Agent Dyer, wearing big, thin-rimmed glasses, and Carl Lambert is talking directly to the camera, and he's like, Hey, what up, Bushheads out there? Everybody wants to come on down, and we got something big for you. I know we say that a lot, and if we get a knock on the wood, or if we get, I mean, the other day, when we had that knock, I swear to God, that is what the, I'm getting ahead of myself. We are going to meet with the one, the only, Dr. Anne Falsom today. You've seen her comment on the messaging board, and you know what she's been up to, and you know that she is the only one we would call if we were to, and then he gets right up into the camera, and he's like, actually find and kill a big fight. Smash that like and subscribe, All right, now, let's talk Dr. Anne Falsom here, camera is still coming towards you guys, and you can kind of hear from behind his weird growl, you hear this camerawoman is just kind of like, hmm, hmm, hmm, just kind of like breathing heavy, you know, just your normal camera person who has something like wheezing in her throat constantly. So if you were to watch Bush videos, then you would be hearing that in the background pretty much the whole time. He's looking, Carl is looking back and forth between all four of you to see kind of who steps forward.
2861.70 2880.94 speaker2  to go for a British accent, steps forward.
2878.66 2888.22 speaker3  because the way she says words nice. Hey, Dr. Falsom, it is an absolute pleasure
2886.26 2890.66 speaker2  That's correct, it is.
2889.70 2902.54 speaker4  I'm sorry, go on. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You're not a rogue head?
2901.58 2947.22 speaker3  I'm a Bush boy. Doctor, doctor, doctor, I know that I said that I promised you a body, and what I have is, I guarantee you, and he looks again at the camera, of a Bigfoot that's ever been found, ever, and we've got it here. His eyes turn to pure sadness, and he kind of pushes the camera away.
2945.14 2953.54 speaker2  I prefer to keep my identity private, and my team as well, and I will be the judge of whether or not this is a Bigfoot.
2951.46 2957.22 speaker3  Everybody roll alertness.
2956.18 2965.06 speaker2  I got a five. 20%.
2961.82 2985.62 speaker3  For rolling rules, if you're new to Delta Green, if you roll under your skill, then that is a success. So you want to roll as high as possible without going over. Price is right rules. If someone's trying to steal something from you, like in this instance, they would want to roll higher than you in order to succeed. So what did you roll, Taylor?
2984.78 2987.10 speaker4  On an 80.
2985.62 2998.98 speaker3  Oh, so that is a success as well.
2998.14 3005.90 speaker4  So we have our first critical success.
3003.78 3013.50 speaker3  Not that it matters, but Lindsay, what did you roll?
3012.42 3037.58 speaker4  The beers, yeah. And I'm also just so paranoid. but I also really, this is the only thing I'm living for.
3032.58 3048.86 speaker3  let's take a quick pause because Discord is messing up.
3047.78 3053.54 speaker2  A jig. That's beautiful.
3052.06 3057.86 speaker0  A wee little jig.
3056.74 3065.54 speaker3  Oh God.
3063.70 3089.02 speaker2  I will take it. Quiet on set.
3087.62 3103.22 speaker3  Lindsay, during Marine, because of the critical fail, roll sanity.
3101.46 3107.38 speaker0  We have a crazy person in our midst. Seven.
3105.58 3177.06 speaker3  While this whole conversation is happening about whether or not Dr. Anne Folsom is going to be on camera or not, you turn around and you see yourself in the reflection of the driver's side mirror of this sprinter van and a chill runs down your spine. And right when you think you're about to hear laughter, you're almost fucking expecting it at this point. Nothing happens. And you're just staring at yourself in this reflection. And it's honestly probably the first time in a minute Dr. Olivia Miller is the only one who notices that Janice Ruth, oh, she's still filming. She may have pointed the camera away from Dr. Anne Folsom, It's just that I really thought you were a fan. And I thought that the whole point of you coming out here was gonna be that you were going to be on camera
3175.42 3190.34 speaker2  talking about the body. Well, we're talking about science. So I need to step inside and take a look at the situation before I allow anyone to record anything.
3186.10 3197.18 speaker3  But it's just me, but then I'll let you see the body.
3194.74 3201.58 speaker2  I don't know, I need to be let inside. You're wasting our time.
3200.62 3224.46 speaker3  Roll persuade. Oh yeah, absolutely. Especially since Dr. Miller critically succeeded and notices that Janice Ruth is still recording.
3221.22 3242.38 speaker0  Excuse me, Dr. Anne Folsom did say specifically that she did not wanna be on camera. And yet I see that you're still recording. Is that how we're going to work here? Is that what we do as friends? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
3238.98 3246.66 speaker3  And she's like fumbling her thumb for the record button.
3245.14 3269.70 speaker0  Are you all right? to see what the hell, like see what's going on with her? Maybe not first aid, but like medicine, medicine. Whichever one you have more of.
3265.34 3275.26 speaker3  So you would know that Janice Ruth has health issues,
3272.18 3278.70 speaker0  Okay, so this is not something to be that worried about.
3275.26 3296.82 speaker3  No, she's just very stressed out and excited. And she's also really worried seemingly
3295.58 3303.94 speaker0  Calm down, just calm down.
3300.30 3359.68 speaker3  All right, all right, yeah, come on in, come on in. We've just been doing, you know, some photo shoots, I guess, with the body. It's actually laying on the pool table. So come on in. And you see, as you guys are turning back and looking at this one door shack, one room, one door, corrugated metal room. Jerome Dyer, this small thin man wearing these large glasses with thin frames is just kind of leaning up against the corrugated metal Jerome, you can just call me Jerome. You know me, Bush, Dr. Anfalsom. You both fucking wink at each other, like enormous winks, like huge winks.
3357.44 3367.64 speaker4  And then I'm like, no, shut up, shut up. Oh, right, right, right, right. And then I just put a fist out.
3364.08 3377.58 speaker3  He like taps on it with one finger and is like testing one, two. Ha, ha, ha, ha, nice to meet you.
3376.58 3383.66 speaker4  This guy's funny.
3382.60 3388.00 speaker3  Everybody going inside?
3387.16 3396.82 speaker2  You going inside?
3393.70 3408.14 speaker4  Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna waver between country boy and. It just depends on who's talking to you.
3403.34 3414.82 speaker3  All right, so you guys all need to roll sanity.
3413.18 3424.86 speaker2  I got a 41 on a 56.
3421.94 3430.94 speaker3  That is also, the doctors have succeeded.
3430.10 3436.54 speaker4  52 on a 40.
3434.54 3470.00 speaker3  This is not what you were expecting and it's also not good. So even though you passed, the three of you who rolled under your sanity still lose one sanity. Chuckster. You. Serious. You are going to roll a D4, which is the pyramid. And then you are going to add one and you are going to lose that many sanity.
3468.20 3478.32 speaker4  Rolled a, rolled a big old four. Jesus.
3476.44 3501.08 speaker3  when you lose five sanity. As you guys all know, and pretending to be people when you lose one sanity, you have to do a shot of hard liquor when you lose two to three sanity, you have to rip a bong, and then anything past that, you have to do a fat line. Ellie, if you'll open the package that we sent you.
3500.24 3504.12 speaker2  Yeah, but also guys,
3502.22 3517.80 speaker0  like being able to send cocaine.
3513.76 3529.88 speaker3  what happens is that you have a temporary break from reality in which you react in an uncontrollable way. Fight.
3529.04 3543.72 speaker0  Fight.
3541.76 3634.38 speaker3  but I think that that's really funny. So we're going to go with that. You can kind of like look at the face. I think the camera is just hitting the face of Charles Chuck, the Chuck Steer Chuck, And then the camera kind of slowly pans around until we can see what all of you are looking at, which is this corpse that is on the pool table laid out. This corpse is not the corpse of a Bigfoot, however. It's a child. It's a wrinkled corpse of a child, completely covered in dark purple bruises. Seems to be a preteen. This thing is riddled with holes from 12 gauge shotgun slugs. Blood has been pouring from these holes onto the pool table, which has a tarp down that the blood is pooling onto. And this bruised body just sits lifeless. For those of you who only lost one sanity, you see the eyes of Carl Lambert as they fill up with tears. Michael, what the fuck?
3633.54 3652.02 speaker2  For a moment. What? I want to say, hooch is in deep. Fine, I'll save that joke for later.
3650.06 3673.74 speaker4  Maybe for not this scene. Dear God. until the Carl Lambert moment. And then I was like, fuck.
3672.02 3685.02 speaker0  Maybe I'll save it for air, but I have theories of what's going on.
3682.18 3830.96 speaker2  You don't know where you found it. In this state as your eyes fall short, Water leaks through your fingers. You're standing in a swirling flood. And only darkness leads you. Find your feet on your broken bones. Clear out the edge again. You're standing in a swirling flood. You're standing in a swirling flood. You're standing in a swirling flood.
