00:00.000 --> 00:03.240
This is yet another introduction to a show

00:03.240 --> 00:07.460
that you listen to called, well it's broadcast live

00:07.460 --> 00:12.460
from 694.2 PTBP and I'm your benevolent host

00:12.940 --> 00:15.860
with the gross wolf the dog.

00:15.860 --> 00:18.340
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Ash

00:18.340 --> 00:21.520
out of North Carolina who tweeted about the show

00:21.520 --> 00:23.740
and tagged that pretending pod,

00:23.740 --> 00:25.540
which is a nice thing to do.

00:25.540 --> 00:29.700
She writes, hey there, I don't have anything to promote,

00:29.700 --> 00:33.300
just wanna let you know how much this show means to me.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.500
I listen every day while I'm at work

00:35.500 --> 00:37.760
and it passes the time so fast,

00:37.760 --> 00:41.000
my job feels almost inconsequential.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.220
Almost as if the atrocities I've committed don't affect me.

00:45.220 --> 00:48.760
As if I can't hear the violent snapping of tendons

00:48.760 --> 00:52.000
and viscera emanating from my monitor.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.900
A mere taste of the despair that lies

00:54.900 --> 00:57.160
within the nightmare network.

00:57.160 --> 01:01.400
Shout out to my friend Gwen for showing me PTBP

01:01.400 --> 01:03.940
and keep up the great work.

01:03.940 --> 01:06.840
Hmm, nightmare network?

01:06.840 --> 01:09.240
Did you just try to sneak in promotion

01:09.240 --> 01:12.980
for another media channel that isn't my radio station

01:12.980 --> 01:16.120
on my radio station?

01:16.120 --> 01:20.440
Hmm, I shall be contacting my lawyers.

01:20.440 --> 01:25.440
They are definitely real and definitely will do law things

01:25.640 --> 01:27.560
at you, for sure.

01:27.560 --> 01:30.080
If you wanna write up something for your wolf to howl,

01:30.080 --> 01:33.120
tag us on the internet or fuck the zuck,

01:33.120 --> 01:35.760
but preferably write us a five star review

01:35.760 --> 01:39.040
on your podcast listening application.

01:39.040 --> 01:42.860
Whichever way you choose, it's time for the news.

01:42.860 --> 01:46.520
Last time we met Dr. Rusty Hooch,

01:46.520 --> 01:49.040
the never missed scientist.

01:49.040 --> 01:53.720
They insist that she enlist, create an ocean of blue mist.

01:53.760 --> 01:57.320
Her ex was pissed, you get the gist.

01:57.320 --> 02:01.760
Dr. Olivia Miller, the sad single mom surgeon.

02:01.760 --> 02:04.560
Her daughter saw her dissect some sort

02:04.560 --> 02:06.920
of a extra dimensional creature

02:06.920 --> 02:09.080
out of a screaming woman's neck

02:09.080 --> 02:12.200
and it shot into a sir's snot socket

02:12.200 --> 02:14.160
who was promptly shot in the skull

02:14.160 --> 02:18.000
by his sorrowful sidekick, full stop.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.840
Next, Doreen Maureen.

02:20.840 --> 02:25.600
Scroll Pinterest on that iPad, that's a good haiku.

02:25.600 --> 02:29.960
Finally, the step motherfucker himself, the Chuckster.

02:29.960 --> 02:32.360
Coming in at five foot seven,

02:32.360 --> 02:37.120
213 pounds of round muscle that is.

02:37.120 --> 02:40.420
It's ball buster 420, hell yeah.

02:40.420 --> 02:43.720
And he survived the holy suffocating,

02:43.720 --> 02:47.240
holy decapitating tongue from hell.

02:47.240 --> 02:49.480
Well, it's time for the briefing.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.640
Yep, you can hear that creeping.

02:51.640 --> 02:56.640
If your ears aren't leaking, it's Molly Healy with circles.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.700
See ring star, deafening heaps.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.840
You don't know where you found it.

03:15.840 --> 03:20.680
In this state, as your eyes fall short,

03:20.680 --> 03:25.680
you better learn how to keep it.

03:30.880 --> 03:32.720
Welcome to Pretending to Be People.

03:32.720 --> 03:35.120
I am here with the same people who are here

03:35.120 --> 03:38.040
on episode one, part one of this story.

03:38.040 --> 03:39.840
It is now part two.

03:39.840 --> 03:43.840
Let's go around the room as well as the TV.

03:43.840 --> 03:48.840
Eleanor is on a TV on our kitchen countertop here.

03:50.960 --> 03:54.040
We'll take a group photo at the end of this

03:54.040 --> 03:55.520
with us and the TV.

03:55.520 --> 03:58.200
That way we can all have a picture together.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.040
Oh, that's right.

03:59.040 --> 03:59.920
Oh, sorry.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.400
And you can put up a picture of yourself.

04:09.720 --> 04:11.080
Let me know when you want to take the picture

04:11.080 --> 04:13.240
and I'll put up like some glam shots.

04:14.120 --> 04:14.960
Yeah, perfect.

04:17.360 --> 04:18.200
You sell it.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.160
Ellie on the kitchen counter, the nudes.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.000
No, okay.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.680
You guys, that's how you make money in this industry.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.720
I've been trying, Eleanor, but-

04:31.720 --> 04:33.520
Dude, more feet, more feet.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.480
Oh, okay, yeah.

04:35.480 --> 04:38.200
More feet in this audio podcast.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.960
Oh no, they want to see it, they want to see it.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.160
All right, let's go around.

04:42.160 --> 04:45.320
Everyone, if you could just like say your name,

04:45.320 --> 04:47.080
your character's name,

04:47.080 --> 04:50.080
and then the worst thought you've ever had about your mom.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.680
So let's start with Allie.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.120
Ooh, can't wait.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.960
My name's Allie.

04:54.960 --> 04:58.160
My character name is Rusty Hooch, Dr. Hooch.

04:58.160 --> 05:01.000
The worst thought I've ever had about my mom

05:01.000 --> 05:03.240
is that I'm exactly like her.

05:05.880 --> 05:08.080
Way to sidestep the question.

05:08.080 --> 05:11.080
Also, you don't have to answer that, any of you.

05:11.080 --> 05:14.520
Jen, if you're listening, I love you, and she will.

05:14.520 --> 05:15.360
Really?

05:15.360 --> 05:16.200
Probably.

05:16.200 --> 05:17.040
Interesting.

05:17.040 --> 05:17.880
Hi, Jen.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.280
My mom won't listen.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.760
Lindsay, you're up.

05:22.760 --> 05:23.600
I'm Lindsay.

05:23.600 --> 05:27.800
I play Doreen, Maureen, or Chlorine, or Boreen,

05:27.800 --> 05:29.160
or whatever you want to call me.

05:29.160 --> 05:30.480
First name, Doreen.

05:30.480 --> 05:34.120
And the worst thought I've had about my mom

05:34.120 --> 05:36.680
is probably that I based this character off of her.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.400
And she won't be listening.

05:40.400 --> 05:44.400
She will not even know that this exists.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.800
I'm going to, what, Facebook?

05:46.800 --> 05:48.640
I have Facebook here.

05:48.640 --> 05:49.840
It's like, I'll tweet at it.

05:49.840 --> 05:50.400
No, I'm probably not.

05:50.400 --> 05:51.200
Because she definitely has a Facebook.

05:51.200 --> 05:51.720
Pinterest.

05:51.720 --> 05:52.240
Pinterest.

05:52.240 --> 05:53.720
You can just DM her on Pinterest.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.800
Slide into her Pinterest DMs.

05:55.800 --> 05:58.840
That's the most definite way to get a hold of her.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.360
Eleanor, who are you playing?

06:00.360 --> 06:01.600
What's up?

06:01.600 --> 06:06.480
Hi, I'm Eleanor DiLorenzo, and I play Dr. Olivia Miller.

06:06.480 --> 06:08.800
And do you want to know the best thoughts

06:08.840 --> 06:10.560
I've had about your mom, Zach?

06:10.560 --> 06:13.200
Yes.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.040
Yes.

06:15.040 --> 06:18.000
OK, actually, I don't know anything about your mom.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.520
But what's her, never mind.

06:19.520 --> 06:20.280
We're not going to go down this road.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.720
You're going to dox my mom?

06:21.720 --> 06:24.080
I'm not going to dox your mom, no.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.240
I'm sure she's a lovely lady.

06:25.240 --> 06:28.800
Most American ladies I've met are super kind and sweet.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.840
So I'm sure she's great.

06:30.840 --> 06:33.640
My mom, on the other hand, what a, no.

06:33.640 --> 06:38.200
She's the worst thought I've had about my mom is,

06:38.200 --> 06:39.520
oh, shit, yeah, I don't know.

06:39.520 --> 06:42.480
I feel like you can't talk shit about your mom

06:42.480 --> 06:45.320
if you have a good mom, because moms are the best.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.760
So I feel bad about even considering

06:47.760 --> 06:50.960
like the list of awful things.

06:50.960 --> 06:57.440
But so I'm thinking, I'm trying like, hmm, one time

06:57.440 --> 07:02.840
she made like a pretty nasty chicken tikka masala.

07:02.840 --> 07:05.400
So that's.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.880
It sounds like you went through a lot of early life trauma.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.920
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

07:10.920 --> 07:15.560
So, yeah, that's the worst mom thought I've had.

07:17.440 --> 07:18.640
And Taylor?

07:18.640 --> 07:20.400
Hi, my name is Taylor.

07:20.400 --> 07:25.120
My character name is Chuck Cheese.

07:25.120 --> 07:26.280
Oh, yeah?

07:26.280 --> 07:27.120
Charles Cheese.

07:27.120 --> 07:27.960
Charles Cheese.

07:27.960 --> 07:29.880
You're going with Charles the Chuckster Cheese?

07:29.880 --> 07:30.840
Charles the Chuckster Cheese.

07:30.840 --> 07:32.440
You can call me Chuck or the Chuckster.

07:32.440 --> 07:33.920
What's your middle name?

07:33.920 --> 07:37.560
Chuckster, Charles Chuckster Cheese.

07:39.120 --> 07:40.640
Charles Chuckster Cheese.

07:40.640 --> 07:41.240
OK, anyway.

07:41.240 --> 07:42.880
My mother-in-law rules, so.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.360
I will say, though, I've had time

07:44.360 --> 07:46.760
to think about this because I was the last one to go.

07:46.760 --> 07:50.560
And when I was a kid, I would walk to and from school

07:50.560 --> 07:51.800
and elementary school.

07:51.800 --> 07:54.760
And if I was mad at my mom, I would intentionally

07:54.760 --> 07:59.560
step on all the cracks to break my mother's back.

07:59.560 --> 08:00.680
Wow, violence.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.600
Did she have back problems?

08:02.600 --> 08:05.320
Yeah, actually, yeah, she had to get a breast reduction

08:05.320 --> 08:07.960
because her boobs are so big it hurt her back.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.920
You're making your mom's boobs bigger

08:09.920 --> 08:12.160
by stepping on the cracks?

08:12.160 --> 08:14.840
Yeah, every time it's like a Pinocchio.

08:14.840 --> 08:17.040
They just grew and grew.

08:17.040 --> 08:20.760
Apparently, my grandma had to do that, the breast reduction.

08:20.760 --> 08:26.400
And I was like, give me those titties.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.800
Literally, it happened in middle school.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.720
And I had a lot of sleepovers as a kid.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.400
And after my mom got the surgery,

08:34.400 --> 08:37.400
any time my friend came over, she was like, look.

08:37.440 --> 08:42.520
And just lift up her shirt and show her smaller scarred boobs.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.440
Do they shape them?

08:44.440 --> 08:45.760
Do they shape them?

08:45.760 --> 08:46.280
They do.

08:46.280 --> 08:49.880
So they look like perky nice titties, huh?

08:49.880 --> 08:54.800
Yeah, she went from double Fs to perky Cs.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.320
So Zach, are you really happy we're

08:56.320 --> 08:58.000
talking about your mother-in-law's boobs

08:58.000 --> 08:59.320
on your podcast?

08:59.320 --> 09:00.880
Yeah, good.

09:00.880 --> 09:03.320
What are your thoughts, Zach, about your mother-in-law's

09:03.320 --> 09:03.820
boobs?

09:03.820 --> 09:09.300
I was really prepared to answer that question

09:09.300 --> 09:10.020
until you finished.

09:16.020 --> 09:17.380
So my thought about mom's boobs.

09:17.380 --> 09:21.020
You can talk about your own mom's boobs if that's easier.

09:21.020 --> 09:24.700
Tell us about your own mom's boobs.

09:24.700 --> 09:30.340
When I was 17, my birthday landed on Easter Sunday.

09:30.340 --> 09:33.500
And so the whole family came over on my birthday

09:33.500 --> 09:35.180
after church.

09:35.180 --> 09:37.340
I'd been going camping with my friends a lot.

09:37.340 --> 09:41.660
And so my mom got me a camping chair, a really nice one,

09:41.660 --> 09:44.620
because I used to borrow their camping chairs.

09:44.620 --> 09:46.980
This was her really nice way of being like,

09:46.980 --> 09:49.700
stop fucking taking my camping chairs.

09:49.700 --> 09:51.500
So she bought me my own.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.780
And I was so stoked, actually.

09:53.780 --> 09:54.780
I was like, this is rad.

09:54.780 --> 09:55.340
This is great.

09:55.340 --> 09:56.700
It's huge.

09:56.700 --> 09:58.220
It was like a big one.

09:58.260 --> 10:01.140
And she's like, yeah, it's oversized.

10:01.140 --> 10:05.420
So it can actually hold up to 250 pounds,

10:05.420 --> 10:07.340
which was pretty cool of her to say

10:07.340 --> 10:10.140
to her very chunky young boy.

10:10.140 --> 10:12.420
So happy birthday to you.

10:12.420 --> 10:13.820
Self-conscious son.

10:13.820 --> 10:14.940
Yeah, yeah.

10:14.940 --> 10:16.500
It's called a captain's chair, right?

10:16.500 --> 10:20.180
It is a captain's chair, extra large, oversized.

10:20.180 --> 10:21.420
For oversized boys.

10:21.420 --> 10:24.460
For oversized boys who are addicted to Mountain Dew

10:24.460 --> 10:26.580
and White Rum.

10:26.580 --> 10:29.180
All right, so let's dive into it.

10:29.180 --> 10:30.020
Dude, Mountain.

10:30.020 --> 10:30.900
Oh, right, actually.

10:30.900 --> 10:33.420
I was going to tangentally about the topic.

10:33.420 --> 10:35.140
I don't even know how to say tangentally.

10:35.140 --> 10:36.020
You know what I'm talking about.

10:36.020 --> 10:36.540
Tangent.

10:36.540 --> 10:37.380
Yeah.

10:37.380 --> 10:37.900
OK.

10:37.900 --> 10:38.380
One more.

10:38.380 --> 10:38.980
One more.

10:38.980 --> 10:40.100
I want to.

10:40.100 --> 10:41.060
One more boob.

10:41.060 --> 10:44.060
No, no, it's not about boobs, but it's about cool women.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.700
I have a cool story about my aunt.

10:45.700 --> 10:49.340
Men in her family would take off their shirts very often

10:49.340 --> 10:52.140
when it was in the summer months in Sweden,

10:52.140 --> 10:54.820
because that's socially acceptable for men

10:54.820 --> 10:56.420
to wear their boobs out.

10:56.460 --> 10:58.180
But even at the dinner table, she's like,

10:58.180 --> 10:59.540
please put on a shirt.

10:59.540 --> 11:00.860
And they're like, fuck off.

11:00.860 --> 11:01.700
Maybe not.

11:01.700 --> 11:04.740
They didn't say that, but maybe something similar to that.

11:04.740 --> 11:06.740
And so one day, she was like, OK.

11:06.740 --> 11:12.580
And she's a 65-year-old woman, and she took off her shirt

11:12.580 --> 11:15.020
and sat down to eat at the table.

11:15.020 --> 11:17.740
And I'm like, that's my goal in life.

11:17.740 --> 11:20.500
I want to take off my shirt.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.220
So we should all take our shirts off?

11:22.220 --> 11:22.940
Yes.

11:22.940 --> 11:23.780
OK, great.

11:23.780 --> 11:24.780
No one will know.

11:24.780 --> 11:25.940
No one will know, guys.

11:25.940 --> 11:27.940
It's an audio drama.

11:27.940 --> 11:28.580
I don't know.

11:28.580 --> 11:31.380
I don't know.

11:31.380 --> 11:34.580
Maybe it will be funnier, just more vulnerable.

11:34.580 --> 11:36.700
Just do sounds with taking your turn off.

11:36.700 --> 11:37.700
Make for better audio.

11:37.700 --> 11:38.540
Vroop.

11:38.540 --> 11:39.420
Vroop.

11:39.420 --> 11:40.820
Skier.

11:40.820 --> 11:42.060
Ding-dong.

11:42.060 --> 11:43.020
Ding-dong-dong-dong-dong.

11:43.020 --> 11:43.900
I get it.

11:43.900 --> 11:44.420
I get it.

11:44.420 --> 11:45.020
I understand.

11:45.020 --> 11:46.780
All right, let's dive into this episode.

11:46.780 --> 11:47.300
Yeah.

11:51.100 --> 11:52.540
Y'all ready to play some Delta Green?

11:52.540 --> 11:55.020
I think we got a pretty good introduction to your characters

11:55.060 --> 11:56.220
in episode one.

11:56.220 --> 11:59.740
The way in which the game works is now going to change,

11:59.740 --> 12:03.460
because we're going to put you all in the same place

12:03.460 --> 12:05.820
and then send you on a little mission.

12:05.820 --> 12:06.620
OK?

12:06.620 --> 12:07.220
OK.

12:07.220 --> 12:07.980
OK.

12:07.980 --> 12:09.500
All right.

12:09.500 --> 12:10.060
Oh, no.

12:13.380 --> 12:16.660
At least a year has passed since each of you

12:16.660 --> 12:19.340
had your unnatural encounters that brought you

12:19.340 --> 12:20.660
into Delta Green.

12:20.660 --> 12:23.740
And here you are again, going into the field

12:23.740 --> 12:27.780
with three strangers sitting in the back of a Sprinter

12:27.780 --> 12:33.900
van turned into a mobile lab in the parking lot of a public park

12:33.900 --> 12:39.580
with no cameras in Shreveport, Mississippi at 2,200

12:39.580 --> 12:42.940
on a cold January night.

12:42.940 --> 12:47.500
Anything to stave off the end of the world, right?

12:47.500 --> 12:51.780
Your handler on this one is a bit dramatic.

12:51.900 --> 12:55.420
Three years ago, this guy's just like talking with his hands.

12:55.420 --> 12:56.260
He's super intense.

12:56.260 --> 12:58.420
He's leaning into all of you as he talks.

12:58.420 --> 13:04.020
Three years ago, Jerome Dyer left his job in Dallas

13:04.020 --> 13:05.580
as an intelligence analyst.

13:05.580 --> 13:10.420
During his second night at the opera, he left.

13:10.420 --> 13:11.860
He abandoned his post.

13:11.860 --> 13:17.940
And he joined a group called Bigfoot Underground Search

13:17.940 --> 13:19.380
and Hunt.

13:19.420 --> 13:25.940
He's been radio silent for three years until tonight.

13:25.940 --> 13:29.180
Dyer made contact with a YouTube account

13:29.180 --> 13:35.860
I run posing as professor and Bigfoot enthusiast Dr. Ann

13:35.860 --> 13:36.900
Falsom.

13:36.900 --> 13:40.460
And this guy looks super proud of himself when he says this.

13:40.460 --> 13:43.380
Agent Dyer is desperately seeking extraction,

13:43.380 --> 13:45.380
but not for him.

13:45.380 --> 13:50.660
For a body, a big body, from an isolated cabin

13:50.660 --> 13:54.820
in the thick, verdant hills of southwest Arkansas

13:54.820 --> 13:58.460
near a small town called Fook.

13:58.460 --> 14:01.980
I've pinned the location on these clean phones.

14:01.980 --> 14:04.540
And he hands you each an older model iPhone

14:04.540 --> 14:08.260
with various used cases on them.

14:08.260 --> 14:12.740
The cases are so that the phone doesn't get shattered, Ali.

14:12.740 --> 14:14.420
Wow.

14:14.420 --> 14:17.180
Called out.

14:17.180 --> 14:20.340
OK, OK, so I've gotten super into Bigfoot Underground

14:20.340 --> 14:24.260
Search and Hunt while portraying this Dr. Ann Falsom.

14:24.260 --> 14:28.220
And the origin story of their ringleader, Carl Lambert,

14:28.220 --> 14:30.780
is fucking tragic.

14:30.780 --> 14:31.700
Check this out.

14:31.700 --> 14:35.060
When he was 14 years old, he went out

14:35.060 --> 14:39.300
camping with his dad and his younger brother Michael,

14:39.300 --> 14:41.740
who was 12 at the time.

14:41.740 --> 14:45.460
So this Bigfoot sneaks into their camp in the night

14:45.460 --> 14:48.140
and abducts the younger brother.

14:48.140 --> 14:50.620
Carl and his dad tried to explain what happened,

14:50.620 --> 14:53.060
but who's going to believe them?

14:53.060 --> 14:56.460
Everyone just assumed the dad killed the boy

14:56.460 --> 15:00.700
and pressured Carl into telling the Bigfoot story.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.420
So dad decides he can't handle being

15:03.420 --> 15:06.060
tried for his son's murder.

15:06.060 --> 15:11.340
So he offs himself, which leaves 14-year-old Carl

15:11.340 --> 15:14.700
with a very singular mission.

15:14.700 --> 15:18.100
Find Bigfoot and kill it.

15:18.100 --> 15:22.780
It's been three decades, but it seems like he finally did it.

15:22.780 --> 15:26.620
So the operation, go to that point, go to the cabin.

15:26.620 --> 15:29.020
Again, GPS marked in those phones.

15:29.020 --> 15:30.620
They have cases on them, don't worry.

15:30.620 --> 15:32.140
Secure the body.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.020
Destroy any evidence.

15:34.020 --> 15:38.060
We can't have, obviously, we can't have this getting out.

15:38.060 --> 15:42.620
Agent Dyer is sabotaging the Wi-Fi and the cell networks

15:42.620 --> 15:43.260
up there.

15:43.260 --> 15:47.140
So Carl and Janice won't be able to post anything

15:47.140 --> 15:48.780
unless they figure out what he's up to.

15:48.780 --> 15:51.860
Oh, Janice Ruth, their third musketeer,

15:51.860 --> 15:55.500
she's a conservation agent, mostly hunts down poachers.

15:55.500 --> 15:58.740
She keeps her identity hidden from most

15:58.740 --> 16:02.060
of the Bigfoot underground search and hunt fan base.

16:02.060 --> 16:04.540
They'd probably deem her untrustworthy, right,

16:04.540 --> 16:05.860
because she works for the man.

16:09.060 --> 16:10.540
Bless you.

16:10.540 --> 16:13.900
He takes another huge rip off of La Croix.

16:13.900 --> 16:18.140
Ruth considers her bachelor's degree in zoology

16:18.140 --> 16:21.540
essentially worthless compared to her countless hours spent

16:21.540 --> 16:25.260
learning everything there is to know about Bigfoot ecology,

16:25.260 --> 16:28.700
behavior, migration on the YouTube channels

16:28.700 --> 16:30.180
of her perceived peers.

16:30.180 --> 16:30.980
Shit.

16:30.980 --> 16:33.380
Sorry, that's so much information.

16:33.380 --> 16:36.540
He looks at his watch and waggles his eyebrows.

16:36.540 --> 16:42.380
Dr. Anne Falsom, with quotes, should be getting on her way.

16:42.380 --> 16:45.220
But that's one of you, obviously.

16:45.220 --> 16:47.500
One of you has to be Dr. Anne Falsom when you get there

16:47.500 --> 16:48.500
to secure the body, right?

16:48.500 --> 16:50.460
Because I've told you that's the whole deal, right?

16:50.460 --> 16:51.900
Real quick, do you guys have any questions?

16:51.900 --> 16:52.740
I have a question.

16:52.740 --> 16:53.220
Yeah.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.300
What the fuck is going on?

16:57.780 --> 16:58.300
Yeah.

16:58.300 --> 17:01.980
We are dealing with a conspiracy theorist, I'm assuming.

17:01.980 --> 17:04.020
Someone who believes in Bigfoot, and we're

17:04.020 --> 17:06.540
here to look into a body.

17:06.540 --> 17:08.620
I don't know what this could possibly be, obviously,

17:08.620 --> 17:10.780
based on this description I was given.

17:10.780 --> 17:11.620
Yeah, it's a Bigfoot.

17:11.620 --> 17:12.340
OK.

17:12.340 --> 17:17.340
Well, how about I make that call when I see what we see?

17:17.340 --> 17:18.700
That's why we hired you guys.

17:18.700 --> 17:20.300
That's why we got two of the smallest.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.740
Oh, yeah.

17:21.740 --> 17:23.460
Are you still going by?

17:23.460 --> 17:25.020
The juxtaposer.

17:25.020 --> 17:26.500
Yeah.

17:26.500 --> 17:29.380
So honored to be in the presence of such righteous ladies.

17:30.300 --> 17:30.780
Fuck.

17:33.540 --> 17:34.020
Very.

17:34.020 --> 17:36.860
So what's your expertise, Chuckster?

17:36.860 --> 17:39.820
Well, you see, I've seen a lot of battle in my day,

17:39.820 --> 17:42.860
fought a lot of not-so-good guys,

17:42.860 --> 17:46.060
and I'm here to keep you ladies safe.

17:46.060 --> 17:46.740
Yikes.

17:46.740 --> 17:47.980
All right.

17:47.980 --> 17:50.860
Dr. Miller taps, absent mindingly,

17:50.860 --> 17:55.060
her revolver she has in her pants,

17:55.060 --> 17:57.860
stuck to the top of the way in her pants because she's like,

17:57.860 --> 18:01.500
guess I will be protecting myself for the rest of the day.

18:01.500 --> 18:02.540
Dope gun.

18:02.540 --> 18:03.540
What's the range on that?

18:03.540 --> 18:06.620
Can I hold it?

18:06.620 --> 18:08.780
Isn't that like sharing a glass of water?

18:08.780 --> 18:10.220
I mean, we just met.

18:10.220 --> 18:11.300
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.020
I understand.

18:12.020 --> 18:12.660
I understand.

18:12.660 --> 18:14.900
We all got our weapons.

18:14.900 --> 18:16.860
Dr. Miller has no idea what a range is.

18:16.860 --> 18:18.620
Or is that Ellie, who has no idea what?

18:18.620 --> 18:20.780
I know nothing about guns, but.

18:20.780 --> 18:22.020
I don't either, literally.

18:22.020 --> 18:22.620
OK, good.

18:22.620 --> 18:25.020
All right, 22 miles.

18:25.060 --> 18:28.220
For people who've listened to pretending to be people before,

18:28.220 --> 18:36.060
normally when someone's like, I pull out my M6942K AK-47

18:36.060 --> 18:38.540
silencer laser pointer, I'm like, all right, yeah,

18:38.540 --> 18:39.740
that's a gun.

18:39.740 --> 18:44.340
So roll for shooting a gun.

18:44.340 --> 18:45.060
That's me.

18:45.060 --> 18:46.460
Some Delta Green people are super

18:46.460 --> 18:48.260
into that side of Delta Green.

18:48.260 --> 18:50.980
I'm all for that, but I don't know any of it.

18:50.980 --> 18:53.580
So therefore, I'm not super into it.

18:53.580 --> 18:56.020
So gun, shoot, pew pew.

18:59.020 --> 19:03.940
Doreen is like somewhere in between the Chuckster

19:03.940 --> 19:07.140
and the intelligence of these two doctors.

19:07.140 --> 19:09.860
So she's just kind of taking it all in.

19:09.860 --> 19:14.580
She knows that she, as an agent, has more capability

19:14.580 --> 19:17.340
than the Chuckster, but is not going to say anything.

19:17.340 --> 19:22.500
It's just going to be, you know, she'll let the Chuckster think.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.460
Chuckster is just raw confidence.

19:24.460 --> 19:26.540
That's what he works on.

19:26.540 --> 19:27.780
And that's fine.

19:27.780 --> 19:28.820
That's fine with Doreen.

19:28.820 --> 19:33.140
Doreen can be our audience stand-in for just looking

19:33.140 --> 19:35.820
back and forth between these two groups,

19:35.820 --> 19:37.380
these intelligent doctors.

19:37.380 --> 19:40.020
She's also just constantly looking over her shoulder,

19:40.020 --> 19:42.180
assuming she's going to see children somewhere.

19:42.180 --> 19:47.540
So not that good.

19:47.540 --> 19:49.460
Anyone want a brewski?

19:49.460 --> 19:54.540
I keep them in my refrigerator pack pant pockets.

19:54.540 --> 19:59.020
You see, I invented a mechanism you can put in pants

19:59.020 --> 20:02.020
with their insulated pockets and ice packs

20:02.020 --> 20:03.620
so I can always keep my beers cold.

20:03.620 --> 20:04.780
What's your name again?

20:04.780 --> 20:06.980
I think maybe you'll just want to call me Charles.

20:06.980 --> 20:10.220
All right, Charles, it is 6.30 AM.

20:10.220 --> 20:11.380
If you can please get that.

20:11.380 --> 20:13.140
It's late at night.

20:13.140 --> 20:14.140
It's 2,200.

20:14.140 --> 20:15.820
It is literally 6.30 AM.

20:15.820 --> 20:17.140
It's 10 PM.

20:17.140 --> 20:18.940
Get that brewski away from me.

20:18.980 --> 20:19.980
It is party time.

20:19.980 --> 20:22.060
I understand, I understand.

20:22.060 --> 20:24.900
Doreen takes him up on the offer.

20:24.900 --> 20:26.220
Dr. Miller is very intrigued.

20:26.220 --> 20:28.860
She's like, a wearable fridge.

20:28.860 --> 20:31.460
That could be quite useful, actually, in terms of,

20:31.460 --> 20:35.620
we will, in order to keep certain vaccines cold.

20:35.620 --> 20:38.980
Happy to share my pants with you.

20:38.980 --> 20:39.900
All right.

20:39.900 --> 20:42.940
Well, for now, let's keep the pants on, Chucky.

20:42.940 --> 20:46.260
And maybe I'll take you up on that offer later.

20:46.260 --> 20:47.460
We'll see how tonight goes.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.580
OK, I'm now uncomfortable.

20:49.580 --> 20:51.220
So I'm going to get the fuck out of here.

20:51.220 --> 20:54.100
You guys need to get going.

20:54.100 --> 20:57.500
They expect Ann to be, Dr. Falsom, sorry,

20:57.500 --> 20:58.900
to be up there soon.

20:58.900 --> 21:00.940
So whoever wants it can have it.

21:00.940 --> 21:04.860
And he throws down four IDs on this table.

21:04.860 --> 21:06.820
And you're in a Sprinter van, right?

21:06.820 --> 21:09.860
But it's been transformed into a lab in the back.

21:09.860 --> 21:12.180
So there is almost like an ambulance.

21:12.180 --> 21:15.540
There's going to be a stretcher in the middle.

21:15.540 --> 21:17.500
So you guys are kind of sitting on either side

21:17.500 --> 21:18.500
of this stretcher.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.420
And he slams down four IDs.

21:20.420 --> 21:23.460
They all say, Dr. Ann Falsom, they

21:23.460 --> 21:25.460
have each of your pictures on.

21:25.460 --> 21:26.780
So he's like, your choice.

21:26.780 --> 21:29.260
Whoever wants to take lead on it can do it.

21:29.260 --> 21:31.340
But I got to get out of here.

21:31.340 --> 21:34.460
My number is in those clean cells, right?

21:34.460 --> 21:39.220
So once you have the body, shoot me a call.

21:39.220 --> 21:43.220
The second location that's in those phones,

21:43.220 --> 21:46.380
GPS, is going to be the drop off point.

21:46.380 --> 21:47.620
So I've got a warehouse.

21:47.620 --> 21:49.700
I'll meet you there after the mission is up.

21:49.700 --> 21:53.900
So I have all the faith in you that I should.

21:53.900 --> 21:54.860
You're very intelligent.

21:54.860 --> 21:55.940
You're very capable.

21:55.940 --> 21:58.700
He looks at two different groups when he says those things.

21:58.700 --> 22:01.100
And that'll be it for me.

22:01.100 --> 22:02.380
I'm going to get going.

22:02.380 --> 22:07.900
And he kind of opens up the back doors of this Sprinter van

22:07.900 --> 22:10.820
and walks off into the parking lot, presumably

22:10.820 --> 22:11.740
to be picked up.

22:11.740 --> 22:12.700
He turns back around.

22:12.780 --> 22:16.700
And he's like, oh, yeah, OK, bye, yep, all right.

22:16.700 --> 22:17.740
Bye, bro.

22:17.740 --> 22:19.620
OK, yep.

22:19.620 --> 22:20.260
See you, man.

22:20.260 --> 22:20.740
All right.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.940
And he finally just turns back around.

22:22.940 --> 22:25.740
You hear a truck start on the other side of the parking lot.

22:25.740 --> 22:27.220
And it swings by and picks him up.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.860
And the truck heads out.

22:28.860 --> 22:32.060
You are now, the four of you, alone,

22:32.060 --> 22:34.300
I mean, with three strangers, in the back

22:34.300 --> 22:38.940
of this converted mobile lab slash mobile ambulance

22:38.940 --> 22:41.700
kind of thing that just looks like a standard Sprinter

22:41.740 --> 22:44.620
van on the outside.

22:44.620 --> 22:46.740
So I'm a pretty dank actor.

22:46.740 --> 22:50.260
But I don't know that I'm so much the doctor type.

22:50.260 --> 22:54.020
So maybe someone wants to take lead on being that doctor.

22:54.020 --> 22:56.380
I think, clearly, I need to be the one to do this.

22:56.380 --> 22:57.660
None of y'all can handle it.

22:57.660 --> 22:59.420
You do seem real right smart.

22:59.420 --> 23:00.820
And I like them bangs, girl.

23:00.820 --> 23:02.820
I am a lesbian.

23:02.820 --> 23:03.980
Stay away from me.

23:09.580 --> 23:10.540
All right.

23:11.380 --> 23:17.700
Hey, Ellie, Eleanor, I'm going to ask

23:17.700 --> 23:19.780
Allie to explain something real quick.

23:23.860 --> 23:27.620
What do you even mean, Zach?

23:27.620 --> 23:29.580
Well, I'm just curious about a couple of things.

23:33.460 --> 23:35.780
Do you want to explain kind of your thought process

23:35.780 --> 23:39.060
going into creating a character for being on the show again?

23:39.100 --> 23:41.540
Yes, so this is my third time on the show.

23:41.540 --> 23:43.140
First time I played a straight man.

23:43.140 --> 23:46.740
The second time I played a closeted lesbian.

23:46.740 --> 23:49.860
At the time, I was identifying as straight.

23:49.860 --> 23:54.220
I am now playing an out lesbian and am an out lesbian.

23:54.220 --> 23:57.380
But you're manifesting pilot this time, right?

23:57.380 --> 23:59.380
So I'm going to be a pilot next.

23:59.380 --> 24:01.820
But the funny thing is there was a time in the middle

24:01.820 --> 24:04.620
where I was like, I cannot believe how problematic it is

24:04.620 --> 24:08.540
that I, as a straight woman, played a lesbian on that show.

24:08.540 --> 24:09.460
That's so terrible.

24:09.460 --> 24:11.900
And now it's fine.

24:11.900 --> 24:13.980
It's actually the only reason she became a lesbian.

24:13.980 --> 24:15.420
There's a cover for that.

24:15.420 --> 24:18.100
That's my testimony from being on pretending to be people.

24:18.100 --> 24:20.940
I became gay.

24:20.940 --> 24:22.140
I love it.

24:22.140 --> 24:25.420
What have you guys done for the show?

24:25.420 --> 24:26.620
Anyways.

24:26.620 --> 24:29.660
OK, so back into the Sprinter van, the back of the van.

24:29.660 --> 24:30.980
You guys have this information.

24:30.980 --> 24:34.740
You know that it is called Bigfoot Underground Search

24:34.740 --> 24:35.740
and Hunt.

24:35.780 --> 24:38.660
The ringleader's name is Carl Lambert.

24:38.660 --> 24:40.900
The other two people helping out

24:40.900 --> 24:43.300
with Bigfoot Underground Search and Hunt

24:43.300 --> 24:46.740
are Janice Ruth, who is a conservation agent

24:46.740 --> 24:48.860
and Bigfoot expert,

24:48.860 --> 24:53.500
and an undercover Delta Green agent named Jerome Dyer,

24:53.500 --> 24:56.820
who has been in the field now for three years

24:56.820 --> 24:58.540
working with this group.

24:58.540 --> 25:01.540
So clearly, he saw something early on with him

25:01.540 --> 25:04.580
that showed him, I need to stick with these people

25:04.580 --> 25:07.060
and make sure nothing crazy happens because they

25:07.060 --> 25:08.540
seem to be onto something.

25:08.540 --> 25:14.340
So Dr. Rusty Hooch picks up this ID

25:14.340 --> 25:19.340
that's got her face on it, her bangs,

25:19.340 --> 25:20.700
and the name Dr. Ann Falsom.

25:20.700 --> 25:21.220
So hold on.

25:21.220 --> 25:25.220
Are the rest of us playing pretend characters?

25:25.220 --> 25:27.180
You can be anyone you want.

25:27.180 --> 25:30.860
You can present yourselves as whatever kind of team

25:30.860 --> 25:31.580
you would like.

25:31.580 --> 25:36.340
But this is just a way to get through the front gate,

25:36.340 --> 25:38.140
if you will, a way to get in the door.

25:38.140 --> 25:42.700
So Dr. Ann Falsom's credentials are she is a, sorry,

25:42.700 --> 25:43.660
medical doctor?

25:43.660 --> 25:47.780
And Bigfoot enthusiast, who has been posting she,

25:47.780 --> 25:51.380
quote unquote, this hand letter as Dr. Ann Falsom has been

25:51.380 --> 25:56.740
posting comments and DMing back and forth with the Bigfoot

25:56.740 --> 25:59.220
Underground Search and Hunt YouTube page.

25:59.220 --> 26:00.860
So they're going to trust her immediately.

26:00.860 --> 26:04.860
Yes, because she would be the obvious first choice

26:04.860 --> 26:07.820
to call upon finding an actual body

26:07.820 --> 26:09.900
so that they can have someone who

26:09.900 --> 26:13.060
is respected, quote unquote, in the field

26:13.060 --> 26:16.140
to present their discovery.

26:16.140 --> 26:20.060
What are the skills they would expect from this Dr. Falsom,

26:20.060 --> 26:20.980
whatever her name is?

26:20.980 --> 26:25.300
They want her to come in and be like, yes, this is Bigfoot.

26:25.900 --> 26:29.860
They want her to probably name it scientifically, right?

26:29.860 --> 26:34.860
And then just be there standing, like a product that

26:34.860 --> 26:37.380
is for sale, but no one wants to buy it.

26:37.380 --> 26:40.180
So they have a doctor come on the screen and be like,

26:40.180 --> 26:41.300
I'm a doctor.

26:41.300 --> 26:46.900
So Dr. Miller agrees that a rusty hooch can take on the role

26:46.900 --> 26:50.260
as this pretend doctor and say, I'll

26:50.260 --> 26:51.780
be your second in command then.

26:51.780 --> 26:53.060
I'll support you.

26:53.060 --> 26:55.620
Are we like med students?

26:55.620 --> 26:57.180
Yeah, we're part of the team.

26:57.180 --> 26:58.740
I think to make it more believable,

26:58.740 --> 27:01.380
maybe just say we're med students like first year,

27:01.380 --> 27:04.260
like here to offer hands.

27:04.260 --> 27:05.940
Yeah, that sounds good.

27:05.940 --> 27:07.820
Dr. Hooch is pretty, she's having

27:07.820 --> 27:09.220
a lot of mixed emotions right now

27:09.220 --> 27:12.580
because she grabbed the ID because she's really

27:12.580 --> 27:14.940
feeling like she's surrounded by idiots,

27:14.940 --> 27:18.020
except for Dr. Miller, who she's extremely intimidated by.

27:18.020 --> 27:20.860
And it's pretty clear that Dr. Miller is smarter than me.

27:20.860 --> 27:23.980
So that's why she chose to grab that ID first.

27:23.980 --> 27:26.540
But she is getting a little anxious about it

27:26.540 --> 27:28.940
now because she actually doesn't believe in Bigfoot

27:28.940 --> 27:33.980
and has no idea what she's about to get into.

27:33.980 --> 27:36.580
I wonder if Dr. Miller senses that.

27:36.580 --> 27:41.020
And she's just like, no, show us the way.

27:41.020 --> 27:42.620
I'm sure it will be fine.

27:42.620 --> 27:44.260
And then like, rinse.

27:44.260 --> 27:47.140
She grins and can see like her teeth,

27:47.140 --> 27:49.140
like in a very predatory way, like.

27:58.140 --> 27:58.980
Who's driving?

27:58.980 --> 27:59.820
I'll drive.

27:59.820 --> 28:01.860
Damn straight.

28:01.860 --> 28:05.740
Dr. Miller, may I call you Olivia or Liv

28:05.740 --> 28:07.500
or the Livmeister?

28:07.500 --> 28:09.220
Like what terms are we on here?

28:09.220 --> 28:11.220
Dr. Miller is fine, thank you.

28:11.220 --> 28:15.180
You guys are on a 50-minute drive from Shreveport,

28:15.180 --> 28:19.540
Mississippi, all the way up into the fucking

28:19.540 --> 28:21.660
boonies of Arkansas.

28:21.660 --> 28:23.820
So when you guys are driving through Arkansas,

28:23.820 --> 28:25.300
it is late at night.

28:25.300 --> 28:29.300
You're coming up on, let's see, 2230, 2330.

28:29.300 --> 28:32.140
So it's around 11.15 PM.

28:32.140 --> 28:34.740
You're 15 minutes out from the destination.

28:34.740 --> 28:36.740
And you're driving through the mountains

28:36.740 --> 28:38.620
and you're driving through the mountains

28:38.780 --> 28:41.100
You're 15 minutes out from the destination

28:41.100 --> 28:45.860
and you start hitting windy turns deep into the woods.

28:45.860 --> 28:50.340
You haven't seen a gas station or any business

28:50.340 --> 28:53.140
in 10 minutes or so.

28:53.140 --> 28:55.580
And you're not sure that there's anyone,

28:55.580 --> 28:59.140
any business that is further into these woods.

28:59.140 --> 29:02.100
Every once in a while, you'll see a small house

29:02.100 --> 29:05.820
or a trailer deep kind of hidden in the woods

29:05.820 --> 29:07.420
on either side of the road,

29:07.940 --> 29:12.660
that is it's like a archway of trees and thick branches.

29:12.660 --> 29:16.380
So you can barely even make out the night sky above you.

29:17.460 --> 29:20.860
You're in a part of the country where you'd feel

29:20.860 --> 29:24.220
fairly uncomfortable if this Sprinter van

29:24.220 --> 29:25.980
were to break down.

29:25.980 --> 29:28.380
Yeah, I've been in those parts of Arkansas.

29:28.380 --> 29:30.140
Well, cool, I have not.

29:31.500 --> 29:34.260
Your GPS is getting closer and closer.

29:34.260 --> 29:36.500
And as you get toward it,

29:36.500 --> 29:39.060
you're starting to lose cell signal.

29:39.060 --> 29:43.740
And you remember that your handler mentioned Jerome Dyer,

29:43.740 --> 29:47.940
Agent Dyer was sabotaging the cell signal up here

29:47.940 --> 29:51.460
so that no photos or videos of this body

29:51.460 --> 29:53.900
that they've taken can get out.

29:53.900 --> 29:55.580
So as you're losing signal,

29:55.580 --> 29:59.540
your dot begins to just kind of float

30:00.900 --> 30:04.180
and there are no more roads on the screen,

30:04.180 --> 30:06.500
but you can kind of make out where you are

30:06.500 --> 30:11.500
in relation to where the dot that you're headed toward is.

30:11.660 --> 30:16.660
And eventually you see a mailbox in the darkness,

30:17.300 --> 30:19.820
your headlights lighting it up.

30:21.140 --> 30:25.660
And there's a road that leads off to the left gravel road

30:25.660 --> 30:28.460
with a gate, a red metal gate.

30:28.460 --> 30:30.580
Y'all, I'm so sorry, but we got to go back.

30:30.580 --> 30:32.820
I actually need cell service for another hour.

30:32.860 --> 30:34.700
We got to go back, I'm sorry.

30:34.700 --> 30:36.620
There's something I got to check on.

30:36.620 --> 30:37.620
What do you got to check on?

30:37.620 --> 30:39.340
It doesn't matter, it's my own personal business.

30:39.340 --> 30:40.780
We just got to go back for,

30:40.780 --> 30:42.140
can we just come back in an hour?

30:42.140 --> 30:45.300
I mean, these people have been out here, what, three years?

30:45.300 --> 30:46.740
They can wait another hour.

30:46.740 --> 30:49.940
I think Rusty's keeping secrets from us.

30:49.940 --> 30:52.820
Doreen who is driving does not say anything

30:52.820 --> 30:53.980
and just keeps driving.

30:54.980 --> 30:56.580
It's like solid as a rock.

30:56.580 --> 31:00.780
Oh my God, Doreen is drunk from the beer she drank.

31:00.780 --> 31:03.860
We're letting a drunk driver take us to this gate.

31:06.220 --> 31:08.340
If you want me to drive, I could drive now.

31:08.340 --> 31:09.280
That'd be fine.

31:10.540 --> 31:12.940
Rusty, maybe you and I can have a side adventure.

31:12.940 --> 31:15.780
You and I can walk back together, find that cell service.

31:15.780 --> 31:16.620
If you look at me one more time.

31:16.620 --> 31:17.660
Maybe become best friends.

31:17.660 --> 31:20.220
I swear to God, I will break your neck.

31:20.220 --> 31:21.140
Man, damn.

31:21.140 --> 31:23.100
Fasty lady.

31:24.460 --> 31:25.660
I don't know, I like that.

31:25.660 --> 31:29.260
Dr. Miller is just staring out through our window,

31:29.260 --> 31:33.300
listening to Chucky and Rusty going back and forth

31:33.300 --> 31:37.700
and then she's like, we could be as quick as possible

31:37.700 --> 31:39.740
so we can get back as soon as possible,

31:39.740 --> 31:41.860
but I think we should head on.

31:41.860 --> 31:43.140
I mean, we're here on a mission.

31:43.140 --> 31:44.660
I know they've been out here for three years,

31:44.660 --> 31:48.260
but I've seen some things to worry

31:48.260 --> 31:51.380
that there might be more of an emergency.

31:51.380 --> 31:52.900
I just want to take a look at it

31:52.900 --> 31:55.220
and then I'll make sure that you get back in time

31:55.220 --> 31:58.260
for whatever phone call it is that you have to make.

31:58.260 --> 32:00.420
Dr. Hooch is extremely intimidated

32:00.420 --> 32:04.140
by the doctor and concedes.

32:04.140 --> 32:06.100
Oh, you know, by the end of this,

32:06.100 --> 32:08.340
I think we're going to be best friends.

32:10.220 --> 32:11.380
I sure hope so.

32:12.300 --> 32:15.980
Chuckster, you noticed that there is a file

32:15.980 --> 32:19.340
that is sitting on the counter space,

32:19.340 --> 32:21.260
you know, next to one of the chairs here

32:21.260 --> 32:24.500
in the back of this mobile lab.

32:24.500 --> 32:25.980
And when you pop it open,

32:26.020 --> 32:28.740
it's got a little bit more information about the mission,

32:28.740 --> 32:31.380
including a code for the gate.

32:31.380 --> 32:33.300
Hey, look, I found this file here

32:33.300 --> 32:35.380
and it seems like it's got a bunch of information.

32:35.380 --> 32:38.620
Maybe even has a code to the gate.

32:38.620 --> 32:40.060
Has your voice changed?

32:40.060 --> 32:41.220
It's very possible.

32:41.220 --> 32:43.140
I think you went pretty hard Southern

32:43.140 --> 32:46.500
after going pretty hard, like excited bro.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.780
It's going to wander where it wants.

32:48.780 --> 32:52.300
Don't expect consistency in any manner from me.

32:52.300 --> 32:53.620
I love it so much.

32:53.620 --> 32:55.780
When you got into Mississippi and Arkansas,

32:56.420 --> 32:58.420
you started code switching super hard.

32:59.620 --> 33:01.620
I just want everyone to be comfortable.

33:02.780 --> 33:04.740
Yeah, you're just, you're basically conforming

33:04.740 --> 33:06.860
to where we are a little bit, yeah.

33:06.860 --> 33:08.900
It's also just where every accent goes

33:08.900 --> 33:11.180
when I try to do an accent.

33:11.180 --> 33:12.300
I just have the one.

33:12.300 --> 33:14.260
I snatched the paper from Chuck

33:14.260 --> 33:16.260
because I say, give me this.

33:16.260 --> 33:18.220
You don't, you probably don't even know how to read.

33:18.220 --> 33:19.060
Let me see this.

33:19.060 --> 33:22.340
Yeah, you write after, I'm not very smart man.

33:22.340 --> 33:25.140
I'm not very smart man.

33:25.500 --> 33:28.220
This is the gamer guy who is like,

33:28.220 --> 33:30.900
just stoked to be like, hey, what up, what up?

33:30.900 --> 33:32.500
How you living like?

33:32.500 --> 33:35.180
Just because I'm confident doesn't mean I'm combative.

33:35.180 --> 33:40.180
I respect these ladies, these smart ladies.

33:42.300 --> 33:43.940
Honored to be in their presence.

33:45.940 --> 33:48.100
Dr. Miller is like, I'm going to die.

33:48.100 --> 33:51.260
And so she starts writing down on her cell phone

33:51.260 --> 33:52.380
without cell service.

33:52.380 --> 33:54.780
She's starting to write down a note for her daughter.

33:55.460 --> 33:58.860
So just like, if I don't survive,

33:58.860 --> 34:02.100
you can take like, there's the money in this account.

34:02.100 --> 34:05.500
And then your asshole father has the rest of the money

34:06.860 --> 34:08.300
stashed away somewhere else.

34:09.500 --> 34:12.100
She knows she's not going to survive this.

34:12.100 --> 34:15.020
Doreen asks for the code.

34:15.020 --> 34:17.460
She reaches back and grabs another beer.

34:17.460 --> 34:18.900
She's just stressed.

34:18.900 --> 34:22.180
She grabs another beer out of the pocket of Chuckie's pants

34:22.180 --> 34:24.380
and just chucks the whole thing right there.

34:25.220 --> 34:26.060
As you pull up to this gate,

34:26.060 --> 34:30.260
you see it's an alpha numerical keyboard

34:30.260 --> 34:31.100
that you're looking at.

34:31.100 --> 34:32.740
It literally looks like an old,

34:32.740 --> 34:37.300
like Macintosh keyboard from like 09

34:37.300 --> 34:39.660
that is like the clear blue,

34:41.340 --> 34:44.980
colorful keyboard that is like almost duct taped

34:44.980 --> 34:47.460
to a stick that's been shoved into the ground

34:47.460 --> 34:49.180
and there are wires coming out of it

34:49.180 --> 34:52.340
and then going down toward the ground.

34:52.380 --> 34:55.260
And then you kind of see the wires above ground

34:55.260 --> 34:57.900
going toward this big rusty red gate.

34:59.620 --> 35:00.860
The code is Bush.

35:05.900 --> 35:09.060
Well, it's Bigfoot underground search and hunt.

35:10.220 --> 35:11.660
They call themselves Bush.

35:12.860 --> 35:17.660
Doreen takes a huge sigh

35:17.660 --> 35:20.380
and then leans her whole upper body out of the window.

35:23.340 --> 35:25.060
Do you want to do that?

35:25.060 --> 35:28.060
Boop, boop, boop, boop.

35:28.060 --> 35:30.300
Oh, it took a long time to hit that H, huh?

35:31.780 --> 35:35.300
Doreen is, she might be a little bit above the-

35:35.300 --> 35:36.140
A little faded.

35:36.140 --> 35:37.540
Yeah, she's a little faded.

35:38.580 --> 35:40.180
That's okay, she's capable.

35:40.180 --> 35:44.340
As you type in the H, the gate slowly begins to-

35:44.340 --> 35:45.180
Beeee!

35:45.180 --> 35:46.020
Beeee!

35:54.700 --> 35:56.100
It finally stops.

35:57.860 --> 35:59.540
In an open position.

36:03.500 --> 36:04.340
God damn it.

36:04.340 --> 36:05.780
And then you-

36:05.780 --> 36:06.620
Yeah.

36:06.620 --> 36:07.460
The gate is open.

36:07.460 --> 36:08.300
Let's do this.

36:08.300 --> 36:10.300
Ahead of you is the same kind of thing

36:10.300 --> 36:13.660
where there are trees climbing on either side

36:13.700 --> 36:16.100
and then meeting above the driveway.

36:16.100 --> 36:20.060
It's a long gravel driveway that goes uphill

36:20.060 --> 36:24.700
and then seems to make a slight dogwood left

36:24.700 --> 36:26.860
where you see that there's a clearing

36:26.860 --> 36:31.860
and lights are coming from a small one room

36:32.180 --> 36:36.340
corrugated sheet metal type just room

36:36.340 --> 36:40.300
that has been laid on maybe not even a legit foundation.

36:40.300 --> 36:42.900
So is this like a shack, like a big-

36:42.940 --> 36:45.260
Yeah, it's a big shack.

36:45.260 --> 36:46.220
Okay.

36:46.220 --> 36:48.740
And then it's like shoddily put together

36:48.740 --> 36:51.180
so there's like light coming through cracks.

36:51.180 --> 36:52.620
Yes, that is exactly right.

36:52.620 --> 36:53.460
Yes.

36:53.460 --> 36:54.300
All right.

36:54.300 --> 36:57.420
And there's one streetlight that like,

36:57.420 --> 37:00.380
it looks like they might've literally stolen

37:00.380 --> 37:05.380
a public streetlight and then moved it up by this shack

37:05.740 --> 37:09.300
and the light is shining down on a truck

37:09.300 --> 37:10.620
that is sitting up there.

37:10.620 --> 37:13.100
Were we given anything in the van?

37:13.100 --> 37:15.100
Oh, there's shitloads of stuff in the van.

37:15.100 --> 37:15.940
Okay.

37:15.940 --> 37:16.780
Weapons.

37:16.780 --> 37:19.340
Not so much weapons as just like lab equipment,

37:19.340 --> 37:22.020
anything you might find in an ambulance.

37:22.020 --> 37:24.860
I like to, because you're up against

37:24.860 --> 37:27.620
such insurmountable odds,

37:27.620 --> 37:32.100
I wanna give you everything you need to try to fight back.

37:32.100 --> 37:35.620
So anything that you think of that could be in there

37:35.620 --> 37:38.900
is probably in there and that's just a nice way

37:38.940 --> 37:40.460
to know that you're fucked.

37:40.460 --> 37:44.940
Dr. Mill almost automatically starts scrubbing up

37:44.940 --> 37:47.980
like if there's any protective gear, masks,

37:47.980 --> 37:50.660
anything of just like assuming that they're gonna go

37:50.660 --> 37:54.420
into a fucking shit show of, I don't know.

37:54.420 --> 37:56.540
She's very paranoid at this point.

37:56.540 --> 37:59.420
And she's assuming that all these dumb asses

37:59.420 --> 38:01.620
will do the same but then she realizes maybe

38:01.620 --> 38:03.020
that none of them are doing it

38:03.020 --> 38:04.260
or I don't know what they are doing

38:04.260 --> 38:07.580
but she's just like, oh, perhaps we should,

38:07.580 --> 38:09.580
like she's trying to be polite but then like, oh no.

38:09.580 --> 38:13.500
Yeah, you kind of point at the three other hazmat suits.

38:13.500 --> 38:16.340
I'm just like opening drawers and not closing them

38:16.340 --> 38:21.220
and like opening cabinets, like rifling through.

38:21.220 --> 38:22.580
Like, what's this?

38:22.580 --> 38:23.540
Oh, dope.

38:25.220 --> 38:28.100
Doreen is just like rolling her eyes at Chucky

38:28.100 --> 38:31.020
and like grabbing her weapons that she just of course

38:31.020 --> 38:33.220
has on her as an agent and just putting them

38:33.220 --> 38:35.180
in the back of the van,

38:35.180 --> 38:36.740
getting ready to put the hazmat suit on

38:36.740 --> 38:39.420
and Chucky is just staring with his mouth open

38:39.420 --> 38:42.140
at all of the weapons she has.

38:42.140 --> 38:44.460
And then she just is staring back at him

38:44.460 --> 38:47.260
while she's slowly pulling up her hazmat suit.

38:47.260 --> 38:51.500
Oh, dude, I think you and I are gonna be BFF-les.

38:51.500 --> 38:53.820
We got some fortune comin'!

38:53.820 --> 38:55.140
What's the L?

38:55.140 --> 38:55.980
Liver.

38:56.860 --> 38:58.180
Pretty sure.

38:58.180 --> 38:59.860
It's best friends. Pretty sure.

38:59.860 --> 39:01.900
I think it's liver.

39:01.900 --> 39:03.780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:03.780 --> 39:04.900
You wanna see my weapons?

39:04.900 --> 39:06.380
I can show you.

39:06.900 --> 39:07.740
I got throwing stars.

39:07.740 --> 39:09.580
I think it's time.

39:09.580 --> 39:13.180
I pull them out and then they're engraved.

39:13.180 --> 39:14.660
I have C.

39:14.660 --> 39:15.500
C.

39:16.420 --> 39:17.260
Oh my God.

39:17.260 --> 39:18.100
Oh my God.

39:18.100 --> 39:19.700
What's my last name?

39:19.700 --> 39:20.820
Oh, C.

39:20.820 --> 39:21.660
Cheese.

39:21.660 --> 39:22.500
Cheese!

39:25.100 --> 39:26.300
Okay, change my mind.

39:26.300 --> 39:28.020
Engraved in each of them is just like-

39:28.020 --> 39:28.860
Just cheese.

39:28.860 --> 39:29.700
A cheddar.

39:29.700 --> 39:33.300
It says CCC and then under it there's-

39:33.300 --> 39:34.380
A block of cheddar.

39:34.380 --> 39:35.380
Yeah, chunk of cheddar.

39:35.380 --> 39:36.220
Yeah.

39:36.940 --> 39:37.780
It's very good.

39:37.780 --> 39:40.180
Please just keep those in your pants.

39:40.180 --> 39:42.300
Don't pull those out, please.

39:42.300 --> 39:43.580
All right, all right, I understand.

39:43.580 --> 39:47.700
Dr. Hooch is very preoccupied with Dr. Miller at this point

39:47.700 --> 39:50.980
and she's really fascinated by how professional she's being.

39:50.980 --> 39:53.220
So she is sort of trying to imitate it,

39:53.220 --> 39:55.980
immediately starts putting on a hazmat suit as well,

39:55.980 --> 39:58.140
also starts putting on gloves and things.

39:58.140 --> 39:59.220
And she's still in the backseat,

39:59.220 --> 40:00.780
but she's like kinda leaning forward

40:00.780 --> 40:02.060
so that Dr. Miller will see

40:02.060 --> 40:04.220
that she's like taking it seriously now.

40:04.340 --> 40:05.700
Ooh.

40:05.700 --> 40:08.540
Dr. Miller smiles a little bit to herself

40:08.540 --> 40:11.580
and then she turns around to the other two.

40:11.580 --> 40:13.900
He's just like, whenever you're ready,

40:13.900 --> 40:17.300
we shall have Dr. Hooch lead the way.

40:17.300 --> 40:18.140
Dr.

40:18.980 --> 40:21.420
Dr. Anne Hooch.

40:22.620 --> 40:24.300
Actually- Dr. Anne.

40:24.300 --> 40:25.140
What's your name? Falsom.

40:25.140 --> 40:25.980
What's your name?

40:25.980 --> 40:26.820
Falsom.

40:26.820 --> 40:27.940
Anne Falsom. Falsom.

40:27.940 --> 40:30.740
F-A-L-S-O-M.

40:30.740 --> 40:32.940
Oh, right, no, Dr. Falsom, sorry.

40:32.940 --> 40:35.820
Dr. Falsom, sorry, I forgot.

40:35.820 --> 40:40.140
You're such a famed Nobel Prize winner,

40:40.140 --> 40:43.540
so you did cure happiness, whatever.

40:43.540 --> 40:44.740
I've cured- I've cured-

40:44.740 --> 40:46.380
Mad pal disease.

40:46.380 --> 40:48.740
Which is the cause of sadness.

40:51.620 --> 40:52.620
Very true.

40:52.620 --> 40:55.260
I start putting on my hazmat suit.

40:55.260 --> 40:57.780
I don't know how well it can be one of these doctors,

40:57.780 --> 40:58.660
these medical students,

40:58.660 --> 41:01.940
so maybe you guys could teach me some terms.

41:01.940 --> 41:05.500
I know the word scalpel, and-

41:05.500 --> 41:07.140
Scalpel.

41:07.140 --> 41:10.020
I know the word liver,

41:10.020 --> 41:14.220
and what other doctor terms could I know?

41:15.100 --> 41:16.660
Dorian's like, I think we should just both

41:16.660 --> 41:17.860
keep our mouth shut.

41:20.660 --> 41:23.500
Now that's exactly what I was gonna propose too.

41:23.500 --> 41:27.060
How about Dr. Anne Falser, Falsom?

41:28.340 --> 41:31.700
You do the talking. You look at the ID again.

41:32.300 --> 41:35.300
Dorian helps Chuck put on his hazmat suit

41:35.300 --> 41:37.300
because he gets his hands-

41:37.300 --> 41:38.540
He gets his arms tangled,

41:38.540 --> 41:42.180
since somehow both arms are in one arm hole.

41:42.180 --> 41:47.020
Dorian is starting to find Chuckie a little bit endearing.

41:47.020 --> 41:50.900
She's kind of like, okay, I'll take care of you.

41:50.900 --> 41:51.740
Pat, pat.

41:53.060 --> 41:55.740
Does he remind you of your whippet?

41:55.740 --> 41:57.860
He kind of reminds me of my whippet, yes.

41:57.860 --> 41:59.580
This is pretty useless.

41:59.580 --> 42:01.700
She's like, I don't want my dog on this trip.

42:01.700 --> 42:03.860
I might as well just take care of this kid.

42:05.420 --> 42:08.180
I start mimicking, she's Pavlov to me,

42:08.180 --> 42:09.460
and I start like,

42:13.900 --> 42:14.740
Good God.

42:15.740 --> 42:17.780
Dr. Miller walks up to Chuck.

42:17.780 --> 42:19.460
If there is any weapons, do we have weapons there?

42:19.460 --> 42:22.620
You said you would give us anything, right?

42:22.620 --> 42:24.460
Oh yeah, what do you find?

42:24.460 --> 42:26.740
I would like to find an automatic rifle,

42:26.740 --> 42:28.740
or something that deals a lot of damage

42:28.740 --> 42:30.300
that Chuck would know how to use.

42:30.300 --> 42:31.140
Yeah, absolutely.

42:31.140 --> 42:33.260
I also have my go pack, so I'm ready.

42:33.260 --> 42:36.180
I got my pistol, I got my knuckle busters,

42:36.180 --> 42:37.940
my throwing stars, and my switchblade.

42:37.940 --> 42:39.660
If you want to find something

42:39.660 --> 42:41.580
that has a little bit more firepower,

42:41.580 --> 42:44.140
then there is a rifle in the back.

42:44.140 --> 42:45.780
I think Dr. Miller finds something,

42:45.780 --> 42:48.900
but she is not able to herself use it,

42:48.900 --> 42:51.700
and so she walks over to Chuck, and it's just like,

42:51.700 --> 42:54.060
now listen to me carefully, boy.

42:54.060 --> 42:57.540
If you see something, if you see something,

42:57.540 --> 42:59.500
stop panting, it makes you look dumb.

43:01.900 --> 43:03.180
Sorry, ma'am.

43:03.180 --> 43:04.100
It's okay.

43:04.100 --> 43:07.900
If you see something, I want you to not think,

43:07.900 --> 43:09.780
I want you to shoot, okay?

43:09.780 --> 43:11.020
The door opens.

43:12.500 --> 43:13.340
Oh God.

43:13.340 --> 43:14.740
Not that, don't shoot that.

43:17.460 --> 43:19.260
I look confused.

43:19.260 --> 43:21.740
If you see something that you might find strange,

43:21.740 --> 43:24.700
and might attack, I don't know if the other two

43:24.700 --> 43:25.740
will be able to do it,

43:25.740 --> 43:30.380
but I guess with your quick reactions and presence,

43:30.380 --> 43:33.220
I'm sure that you will be the quickest to act.

43:33.220 --> 43:35.220
Whatever terrible thing we're gonna see in there,

43:35.220 --> 43:37.860
I wanted to not leave this room.

43:37.860 --> 43:41.620
Chuck harkens back to his short-lived military days,

43:41.620 --> 43:45.380
and really likes having a leader tell him what to do,

43:45.380 --> 43:50.140
so he stands in line, mission ready, and says, yes ma'am.

43:50.140 --> 43:51.620
You better be ready, Dr. Miller.

43:51.620 --> 43:53.340
He's gonna piss in your bed.

43:53.340 --> 43:54.180
Yeah.

43:55.180 --> 43:57.740
And she's like, oh God, what have I done?

43:57.740 --> 44:01.060
I start to pull a beer out of my refrigerator pants,

44:01.060 --> 44:05.820
and Dr. Miller slaps it out of my hand.

44:05.820 --> 44:07.260
Maybe, if she wants to.

44:07.260 --> 44:08.300
Oh, hell yeah.

44:08.300 --> 44:11.220
Or she's like, perhaps later, perhaps later.

44:11.220 --> 44:12.620
Yes, yes ma'am, yes ma'am.

44:13.660 --> 44:15.500
Let's go, yes ma'am.

44:15.500 --> 44:18.660
And she taps his shoulder a little harder than necessary,

44:18.660 --> 44:21.020
but I'm thinking like maybe he likes the roughness.

44:21.020 --> 44:22.860
Yeah, and then he does a little burp.

44:23.700 --> 44:24.540
Okay.

44:25.380 --> 44:29.860
You truly are a child, like a young infant child.

44:32.140 --> 44:34.780
Y'all, I got a question real fast before we go inside.

44:34.780 --> 44:39.780
Oh my God, this could just keep happening forever.

44:39.780 --> 44:41.700
The getting ready stage.

44:44.260 --> 44:45.740
Do you think that Dr. Anne Falsom

44:45.740 --> 44:46.780
should have a British accent?

44:46.780 --> 44:48.500
I just wonder if they'll believe me more.

44:48.500 --> 44:49.540
The front door opens.

44:49.540 --> 44:52.500
It's a metal door of this metal corrugated shack,

44:53.020 --> 44:58.020
and walking out backwards is seemingly Carl Lambert.

44:58.180 --> 45:02.620
He is in his early 40s, and he is slightly overweight,

45:02.620 --> 45:06.740
severely balding, wears a dirty tank top,

45:06.740 --> 45:09.180
and as he's walking backwards,

45:09.180 --> 45:11.700
his love handles on either side

45:11.700 --> 45:15.060
are kind of jiggling with each step as he walks backwards,

45:15.060 --> 45:18.020
and as your eyes go up to the top of his head,

45:18.020 --> 45:21.100
he has a makeshift headband, like a t-shirt,

45:21.140 --> 45:23.660
like a ratty old t-shirt that's been ripped,

45:23.660 --> 45:26.620
and is now tied around his head.

45:26.620 --> 45:30.420
He is talking to the camera that is being run

45:30.420 --> 45:35.300
by seemingly Janice Ruth, and then behind her even,

45:35.300 --> 45:39.180
you see a man, you can assume this is Agent Dyer,

45:39.180 --> 45:43.660
and he is kind of a small, thin man

45:43.660 --> 45:47.820
wearing big, thin-rimmed glasses,

45:47.860 --> 45:51.340
and Carl Lambert is talking directly to the camera,

45:51.340 --> 45:52.260
and he's like,

45:53.420 --> 45:57.540
welcome to another Bush product.

45:57.540 --> 45:59.300
Hey, what up, Bushheads out there?

45:59.300 --> 46:00.620
Everybody wants to come on down,

46:00.620 --> 46:02.420
and we got something big for you.

46:02.420 --> 46:03.580
I know we say that a lot,

46:03.580 --> 46:05.500
and if we get a knock on the wood,

46:05.500 --> 46:08.380
or if we get, I mean, the other day,

46:08.380 --> 46:10.100
when we had that knock, I swear to God,

46:10.100 --> 46:13.780
that is what the, I'm getting ahead of myself.

46:13.820 --> 46:16.700
We are going to meet with the one,

46:16.700 --> 46:21.460
the only, Dr. Anne Falsom today.

46:21.460 --> 46:23.460
You've seen her comment on the messaging board,

46:23.460 --> 46:25.140
and you know what she's been up to,

46:25.140 --> 46:27.380
and you know that she is the only one

46:27.380 --> 46:30.060
we would call if we were to,

46:30.060 --> 46:32.060
and then he gets right up into the camera,

46:32.060 --> 46:37.060
and he's like, actually find and kill a big fight.

46:41.460 --> 46:42.940
It happened!

46:42.980 --> 46:45.380
Yes, I am so excited for you.

46:45.380 --> 46:46.940
Smash that like and subscribe,

46:46.940 --> 46:48.580
comment below when you see this thing.

46:48.580 --> 46:51.540
All right, now, let's talk Dr. Anne Falsom here,

46:51.540 --> 46:53.140
and let's get into the thing going.

46:53.140 --> 46:55.100
And he turns around,

46:55.100 --> 46:57.500
camera is still coming towards you guys,

46:57.500 --> 47:00.900
and you can kind of hear from behind his weird growl,

47:00.900 --> 47:03.660
you hear this camerawoman is just kind of like,

47:03.660 --> 47:08.460
hmm, hmm, hmm, just kind of like breathing heavy,

47:08.460 --> 47:12.260
you know, just your normal camera person

47:12.300 --> 47:16.300
who has something like wheezing in her throat constantly.

47:17.220 --> 47:20.540
So if you were to watch Bush videos,

47:24.540 --> 47:26.660
then you would be hearing that in the background

47:26.660 --> 47:28.300
pretty much the whole time.

47:28.300 --> 47:31.300
And she brought her team!

47:33.460 --> 47:35.980
He's looking, Carl is looking back and forth

47:35.980 --> 47:39.500
between all four of you to see kind of who steps forward.

47:39.500 --> 47:41.700
Very frazzled, Rusty quickly decides

47:41.700 --> 47:43.980
to go for a British accent, steps forward.

47:43.980 --> 47:46.980
Chuck steps forward with her, and then she pushes him back.

47:49.060 --> 47:50.980
I shove Chuck back in his place.

47:52.020 --> 47:55.660
Hello, my name is Dr. Anne Falsom.

47:55.660 --> 47:58.660
Aw, yeah, and you can even tell how smart she is

47:58.660 --> 48:00.940
because the way she says words nice.

48:00.940 --> 48:03.860
Hey, Dr. Falsom, it is an absolute pleasure

48:03.860 --> 48:06.260
to finally meet you on camera.

48:06.260 --> 48:08.220
That's correct, it is.

48:08.220 --> 48:09.700
Are you channeling Joe Rogan right now?

48:09.700 --> 48:10.660
I'm sorry, go on.

48:12.140 --> 48:12.980
No!

48:12.980 --> 48:15.740
I've never, I haven't seen him since Fear Factor.

48:16.940 --> 48:18.180
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

48:18.180 --> 48:19.780
You're not a rogue head?

48:19.780 --> 48:21.580
I don't know, is that true?

48:21.580 --> 48:22.540
I'm a Bush boy.

48:26.940 --> 48:28.220
Doctor, doctor, doctor,

48:29.180 --> 48:32.300
I know that I said that I promised you a body,

48:32.300 --> 48:36.260
and what I have is, I guarantee you,

48:36.260 --> 48:37.940
and he looks again at the camera,

48:37.980 --> 48:42.980
the first taken and held and killed corpse

48:43.940 --> 48:47.380
of a Bigfoot that's ever been found, ever,

48:47.380 --> 48:49.220
and we've got it here.

48:49.220 --> 48:52.300
Dr. Falsom, what are your thoughts on the situation?

48:52.300 --> 48:54.460
First of all, I don't want to be on camera.

48:55.620 --> 49:00.060
His eyes turn to pure sadness,

49:00.980 --> 49:03.380
and he kind of pushes the camera away.

49:03.380 --> 49:05.140
But I thought you were a fan.

49:05.140 --> 49:07.220
I prefer to keep my identity private,

49:07.220 --> 49:08.780
and my team as well,

49:08.780 --> 49:11.460
and I will be the judge of whether or not this is a Bigfoot.

49:11.460 --> 49:13.540
Everybody roll alertness.

49:16.180 --> 49:17.220
I got a five.

49:17.220 --> 49:19.580
Oh, what is your alertness?

49:19.580 --> 49:20.420
20%.

49:20.420 --> 49:21.820
Oh, then that is a success.

49:21.820 --> 49:25.060
For rolling rules, if you're new to Delta Green,

49:25.060 --> 49:28.740
if you roll under your skill, then that is a success.

49:28.740 --> 49:33.300
So you want to roll as high as possible without going over.

49:33.300 --> 49:34.460
Price is right rules.

49:34.620 --> 49:36.420
If someone's trying to steal something from you,

49:36.420 --> 49:37.860
like in this instance,

49:37.860 --> 49:39.420
they would want to roll higher than you

49:39.420 --> 49:41.620
in order to succeed.

49:41.620 --> 49:43.100
So what did you roll, Taylor?

49:43.100 --> 49:43.940
A 43.

49:43.940 --> 49:44.780
On a?

49:44.780 --> 49:45.620
On an 80.

49:45.620 --> 49:47.100
Oh, so that is a success as well.

49:47.100 --> 49:47.940
Yeah.

49:47.940 --> 49:49.460
Eleanor, what did you roll?

49:49.460 --> 49:52.540
An 11, alertness 20, so.

49:52.540 --> 49:54.300
And your dice match.

49:54.300 --> 49:55.500
Yep.

49:55.500 --> 49:56.340
And it's under.

49:56.340 --> 49:58.140
All right, so that's our first critical success.

49:58.140 --> 49:58.980
So we have our first critical success.

49:58.980 --> 49:59.820
Yay!

49:59.820 --> 50:02.740
Ooh, all right, nice.

50:02.740 --> 50:03.740
Nice.

50:03.780 --> 50:05.900
Not that it matters, but Lindsay, what did you roll?

50:05.900 --> 50:07.700
Well, I did crit fail.

50:07.700 --> 50:08.540
Oh my God.

50:11.060 --> 50:12.420
Those beers hit her hard.

50:12.420 --> 50:13.500
The beers, yeah.

50:13.500 --> 50:14.900
And I'm also just so paranoid.

50:14.900 --> 50:16.700
I think I just like don't want to be here at all,

50:16.700 --> 50:19.500
but I also really, this is the only thing I'm living for.

50:21.820 --> 50:24.060
There's a lot inside of you.

50:25.620 --> 50:27.860
It's a mixture of me and my mom in real life.

50:29.460 --> 50:32.580
Okay, so with that being said,

50:32.580 --> 50:37.580
let's take a quick pause because Discord is messing up.

50:37.940 --> 50:39.020
You want me to whistle a song?

50:39.020 --> 50:40.180
Yeah, I'd love that.

50:40.180 --> 50:44.340
What was it called?

50:44.340 --> 50:46.420
It's called a little jig.

50:47.780 --> 50:48.860
A jig.

50:48.860 --> 50:49.860
That's beautiful.

50:49.860 --> 50:52.060
A little jig, yes.

50:52.060 --> 50:53.540
A wee little jig.

50:53.540 --> 50:56.740
I shush away, but ever jigging me.

50:56.740 --> 50:57.860
Oh God.

50:57.860 --> 51:00.500
I should have gone with that for my dog accent.

51:00.500 --> 51:01.340
I just want to say,

51:01.340 --> 51:03.700
if ever given the opportunity to have more than one accent,

51:03.700 --> 51:05.540
I will take it.

51:05.540 --> 51:08.260
The last time I got to play a fucking shit.

51:11.460 --> 51:12.780
Zach, you're doing a great job.

51:12.780 --> 51:14.420
I'm losing my mind.

51:14.420 --> 51:16.060
You're doing such a good job.

51:16.060 --> 51:17.820
Thanks guys, I appreciate that.

51:20.340 --> 51:21.660
Quiet on set.

51:24.860 --> 51:26.220
Hello.

51:26.220 --> 51:27.620
Hello.

51:27.620 --> 51:29.020
Lindsay, during Marine,

51:29.020 --> 51:31.220
because of the critical fail, roll sanity.

51:31.220 --> 51:32.060
Damn it.

51:32.060 --> 51:33.540
Yeah.

51:33.540 --> 51:35.740
Come on, you stupid ass.

51:35.740 --> 51:38.460
Jesus Christ, Doreen is down that ladder.

51:41.460 --> 51:43.220
We have a crazy person in our midst.

51:43.220 --> 51:44.340
Seven.

51:44.340 --> 51:45.580
Oh, success.

51:45.580 --> 51:47.380
While this whole conversation is happening

51:47.380 --> 51:49.140
about whether or not Dr. Anne Folsom

51:49.140 --> 51:50.980
is going to be on camera or not,

51:52.140 --> 51:55.940
you turn around and you see yourself

51:55.980 --> 52:00.180
in the reflection of the driver's side mirror

52:01.540 --> 52:06.540
of this sprinter van and a chill runs down your spine.

52:06.980 --> 52:09.660
And right when you think you're about to hear laughter,

52:09.660 --> 52:12.220
you're almost fucking expecting it at this point.

52:13.220 --> 52:14.900
Nothing happens.

52:14.900 --> 52:18.100
And you're just staring at yourself in this reflection.

52:18.100 --> 52:20.300
And it's honestly probably the first time in a minute

52:20.300 --> 52:23.820
you've been able to just hold eye contact with yourself.

52:23.860 --> 52:28.500
And it kind of feels good to see and be seen individually.

52:28.500 --> 52:30.340
With your critical success, Eleanor,

52:30.340 --> 52:34.740
Dr. Olivia Miller is the only one who notices

52:34.740 --> 52:37.620
that Janice Ruth, oh, she's still filming.

52:37.620 --> 52:41.340
She may have pointed the camera away from Dr. Anne Folsom,

52:41.340 --> 52:43.660
but she did not stop recording.

52:43.660 --> 52:46.060
All right, yeah, no, I understand, I understand.

52:46.060 --> 52:48.420
It's just that I really thought you were a fan.

52:48.420 --> 52:51.860
And I thought that the whole point of you coming out here

52:51.860 --> 52:55.420
was gonna be that you were going to be on camera

52:55.420 --> 52:57.060
talking about the body.

52:57.060 --> 52:58.420
Well, we're talking about science.

52:58.420 --> 53:01.460
So I need to step inside and take a look at the situation

53:01.460 --> 53:03.860
before I allow anyone to record anything.

53:03.860 --> 53:06.100
Okay, so can we try this again?

53:06.100 --> 53:10.340
But it's just me, but then I'll let you see the body.

53:10.340 --> 53:14.740
And then after that, then you'll be on camera.

53:14.740 --> 53:17.180
I don't know, I need to be let inside.

53:17.180 --> 53:18.980
You're wasting our time.

53:18.980 --> 53:20.620
Nice.

53:20.620 --> 53:21.580
Roll persuade.

53:21.580 --> 53:23.220
Please.

53:23.220 --> 53:25.260
I got a 94 on a 20.

53:27.540 --> 53:30.300
I mean, I suppose, can't Dr. Miller step in?

53:30.300 --> 53:31.180
Oh yeah, absolutely.

53:31.180 --> 53:33.500
Especially since Dr. Miller critically succeeded

53:33.500 --> 53:37.540
and notices that Janice Ruth is still recording.

53:37.540 --> 53:41.220
So you can use that kind of maybe as leverage here.

53:41.220 --> 53:44.460
Excuse me, Dr. Anne Folsom did say specifically

53:44.460 --> 53:45.980
that she did not wanna be on camera.

53:45.980 --> 53:48.780
And yet I see that you're still recording.

53:48.780 --> 53:50.060
Is that how we're going to work here?

53:50.060 --> 53:52.660
Is that what we do as friends?

53:53.700 --> 53:55.940
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

53:55.940 --> 53:58.980
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't notice.

53:58.980 --> 54:02.380
And she's like fumbling her thumb for the record button.

54:02.380 --> 54:05.140
She's like, I really, I didn't know.

54:05.140 --> 54:06.660
Are you all right?

54:06.660 --> 54:07.500
Yeah, I'm fine.

54:07.500 --> 54:09.340
Can I roll like a first aid or something

54:09.340 --> 54:11.420
to see what the hell, like see what's going on with her?

54:11.420 --> 54:12.380
Yeah, absolutely.

54:12.380 --> 54:13.500
You can roll a first aid.

54:13.500 --> 54:15.300
First aid or is that, does that make sense?

54:15.300 --> 54:17.820
Maybe not first aid, but like medicine, medicine.

54:17.820 --> 54:19.180
Yeah, medicine works, yeah.

54:19.220 --> 54:20.780
Whichever one you have more of.

54:22.060 --> 54:24.260
52 on a 60, so who?

54:24.260 --> 54:25.340
Ooh, nice.

54:25.340 --> 54:29.700
So you would know that Janice Ruth has health issues,

54:29.700 --> 54:32.180
specifically maybe some untreated asthma.

54:32.180 --> 54:35.260
Okay, so this is not something to be that worried about.

54:35.260 --> 54:38.700
No, she's just very stressed out and excited.

54:38.700 --> 54:41.660
And she's also really worried seemingly

54:41.660 --> 54:43.920
that she did something bad.

54:43.920 --> 54:47.540
You're getting onto her, which she's not used to.

54:47.580 --> 54:51.700
And she's just like, I'm sorry, I didn't know.

54:51.700 --> 54:52.660
It's okay.

54:52.660 --> 54:55.580
I was just trying, I was just trying.

54:55.580 --> 54:56.820
Calm down, just calm down.

54:56.820 --> 55:00.300
So you see her click it off and the camera's off.

55:00.300 --> 55:03.940
All right, all right, yeah, come on in, come on in.

55:03.940 --> 55:08.820
We've just been doing, you know, some photo shoots,

55:08.820 --> 55:11.420
I guess, with the body.

55:11.420 --> 55:14.100
It's actually laying on the pool table.

55:14.140 --> 55:15.580
So come on in.

55:15.580 --> 55:18.620
And you see, as you guys are turning back

55:18.620 --> 55:21.160
and looking at this one door shack,

55:21.160 --> 55:24.960
one room, one door, corrugated metal room.

55:24.960 --> 55:27.980
Jerome Dyer, this small thin man

55:27.980 --> 55:31.700
wearing these large glasses with thin frames

55:31.700 --> 55:34.540
is just kind of leaning up against the corrugated metal

55:34.540 --> 55:36.340
next to the door.

55:36.340 --> 55:37.220
Hello?

55:37.220 --> 55:38.120
Who are you?

55:38.120 --> 55:40.520
Jerome, you can just call me Jerome.

55:40.520 --> 55:42.960
You know me, Bush, Dr. Anfalsom.

55:43.800 --> 55:48.080
Yes, I do know you very well.

55:48.080 --> 55:49.780
You both fucking wink at each other,

55:49.780 --> 55:52.280
like enormous winks, like huge winks.

55:53.480 --> 55:55.840
Oh, I know who you are.

55:57.440 --> 55:59.680
And then I'm like, no, shut up, shut up.

55:59.680 --> 56:00.520
Oh, right, right, right, right.

56:00.520 --> 56:02.020
And then I just put a fist out.

56:04.080 --> 56:07.640
He like taps on it with one finger

56:07.640 --> 56:10.100
and is like testing one, two.

56:10.100 --> 56:13.120
Ha, ha, ha, ha, nice to meet you.

56:14.300 --> 56:15.260
That was so dope.

56:16.580 --> 56:17.580
This guy's funny.

56:19.060 --> 56:21.700
I just walk inside, cause I'm over the bullshit.

56:21.700 --> 56:22.600
I'm coming with her.

56:22.600 --> 56:23.660
Everybody going inside?

56:23.660 --> 56:25.500
Yeah, I wanna see this thing.

56:25.500 --> 56:26.340
Chuckster.

56:26.340 --> 56:27.160
Chuckster.

56:27.160 --> 56:28.000
You going inside?

56:28.000 --> 56:29.540
Hell yeah, bro.

56:29.540 --> 56:31.380
There he is, there he is.

56:33.700 --> 56:36.820
Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna waver between country boy and.

56:36.820 --> 56:39.180
It just depends on who's talking to you.

56:41.020 --> 56:43.340
Chuckster, the code switch king.

56:43.340 --> 56:48.140
All right, so you guys all need to roll sanity.

56:48.140 --> 56:48.980
Oh, fuck.

56:53.180 --> 56:54.820
I got a 41 on a 56.

56:55.820 --> 56:56.860
That is a success.

56:56.860 --> 57:00.020
I got a 54 on a 56.

57:01.940 --> 57:04.860
That is also, the doctors have succeeded.

57:04.860 --> 57:08.080
I got a 10 on a 60.

57:08.080 --> 57:09.620
Also a success.

57:10.100 --> 57:10.940
52 on a 40.

57:10.940 --> 57:11.780
Oh no.

57:11.780 --> 57:14.540
And there's the fail, there's the fail.

57:14.540 --> 57:16.540
This is not what you were expecting

57:16.540 --> 57:19.300
and it's also not good.

57:19.300 --> 57:21.740
So even though you passed,

57:21.740 --> 57:23.860
the three of you who rolled under your sanity

57:23.860 --> 57:27.420
still lose one sanity.

57:28.540 --> 57:29.380
Chuckster.

57:29.380 --> 57:30.200
Yep.

57:30.200 --> 57:32.300
No article for you this time.

57:32.300 --> 57:33.140
You.

57:33.140 --> 57:33.960
Serious.

57:33.960 --> 57:38.600
You are going to roll a D4,

57:38.600 --> 57:40.480
which is the pyramid.

57:40.480 --> 57:42.940
And then you are going to add one

57:42.940 --> 57:45.320
and you are going to lose that many sanity.

57:46.720 --> 57:48.200
Four.

57:48.200 --> 57:50.000
Rolled a, rolled a big old four.

57:51.640 --> 57:54.160
So I lose five sanity, I'm now at 35.

57:54.160 --> 57:55.000
Jesus.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.440
There's a thing that happens in this game

57:56.440 --> 57:58.320
when you lose five sanity.

57:58.320 --> 57:59.480
As you guys all know,

57:59.480 --> 58:03.160
and pretending to be people when you lose one sanity,

58:03.200 --> 58:04.960
you have to do a shot of hard liquor

58:04.960 --> 58:07.000
when you lose two to three sanity,

58:07.000 --> 58:08.360
you have to rip a bong,

58:08.360 --> 58:10.000
and then anything past that,

58:10.000 --> 58:11.360
you have to do a fat line.

58:14.880 --> 58:17.440
Ellie, if you'll open the package that we sent you.

58:18.400 --> 58:20.240
I was like, I'm trying to lose some sanity.

58:20.240 --> 58:21.080
Yeah, but also guys,

58:21.080 --> 58:22.220
you have so much money,

58:22.220 --> 58:24.120
like being able to send cocaine.

58:26.120 --> 58:27.920
It's what all the Patreon money.

58:28.840 --> 58:33.760
When you lose five sanity in Delta Green,

58:33.760 --> 58:37.800
what happens is that you have a temporary break from reality

58:37.800 --> 58:42.120
in which you react in an uncontrollable way.

58:42.120 --> 58:46.240
So you are either going to fight, fight.

58:46.240 --> 58:47.380
What did I say first?

58:47.380 --> 58:48.220
Fight.

58:48.220 --> 58:49.040
Fight.

58:49.040 --> 58:49.880
Fight.

58:49.880 --> 58:50.720
Or fight.

58:52.560 --> 58:55.720
What I was wanting to do was I'm frozen,

58:55.760 --> 58:59.680
but I'm just going cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

58:59.680 --> 59:01.760
Okay, normally you would roll,

59:01.760 --> 59:03.720
but I think that that's really funny.

59:03.720 --> 59:05.280
So we're going to go with that.

59:08.320 --> 59:11.120
You can kind of like look at the face.

59:11.120 --> 59:13.600
I think the camera is just hitting the face

59:13.600 --> 59:16.720
of Charles Chuck, the Chuck Steer Chuck,

59:16.720 --> 59:18.520
as he's doing cool, cool.

59:18.520 --> 59:21.200
And then the camera kind of slowly pans around

59:21.200 --> 59:25.360
until we can see what all of you are looking at,

59:25.360 --> 59:30.200
which is this corpse that is on the pool table laid out.

59:30.200 --> 59:35.200
This corpse is not the corpse of a Bigfoot, however.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.720
It's a child.

59:39.720 --> 59:43.880
It's a wrinkled corpse of a child,

59:43.880 --> 59:47.320
completely covered in dark purple bruises.

59:47.320 --> 59:48.980
Seems to be a preteen.

59:50.240 --> 59:53.300
This thing is riddled with holes

59:53.300 --> 59:56.580
from 12 gauge shotgun slugs.

59:56.580 --> 01:00:01.460
Blood has been pouring from these holes onto the pool table,

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:06.460
which has a tarp down that the blood is pooling onto.

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:10.140
And this bruised body just sits lifeless.

01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:14.200
For those of you who only lost one sanity,

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.920
you see the eyes of Carl Lambert

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.780
as they fill up with tears.

01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:25.220
Michael, what the fuck?

01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:34.380
For a moment.

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:35.220
Oh, that's the end of the episode.

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:36.060
What?

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:38.880
I want to say, hooch is in deep.

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:44.300
Amazing.

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:48.380
Fine, I'll save that joke for later.

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:52.020
Maybe for not this scene.

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:54.380
Dear God.

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:55.320
Wow.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.220
Shit.

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:57.140
That was really cool.

01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:57.980
So that's the end of episode two.

01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:00.100
That was really cool, thank you.

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:01.580
Thanks for playing.

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:06.580
For, I was not sure if that was what they knew was there

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:09.900
until the Carl Lambert moment.

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:11.180
And then I was like, fuck.

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:12.020
I have theories.

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:13.740
Maybe I'll save it for air,

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:16.100
but I have theories of what's going on.

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:18.600
See rings of deafening people.

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:25.020
You don't know where you found it.

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:30.200
In this state as your eyes fall short,

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:35.040
you better learn how to keep it.

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:57.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:00.900
Clasp your fist over all the blood.

01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:06.620
Water leaks through your fingers.

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:11.300
You're standing in a swirling flood.

01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:16.480
And only darkness leads you.

01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:22.860
Ooh.

01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:42.080
Falling fast into deep abyss.

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:47.880
Till it tears you out again.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:50.960
Find your feet on your broken bones.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.160
Clear out the edge again.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:20.960
You're standing in a swirling flood.

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:50.960
You're standing in a swirling flood.

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:20.960
You're standing in a swirling flood.

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:50.960
You're standing in a swirling flood.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:20.960
You're standing in a swirling flood.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:51.120
You're standing in a swirling flood.

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:20.960
You're standing in a swirling flood.
