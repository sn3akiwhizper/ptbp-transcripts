125600	137920	no backbone
156240	163920	so
165600	170720	i think tilde might be wrapped up in some some weird stuff that's been going around in town
170720	177920	can you give her a call uh mildred uh pulls out her phone and calls and you hear a
177920	180240	um
184000	187920	coming from upstairs uh john you would you would hear it like in the same room as you
187920	196240	there's some kind of huge bee in this room uh i what kind of phone does she have iphone
197360	203760	full stop all right is it locked yeah does she have any pictures of herself in the room
203760	208880	yeah all right i try to unlock it with a picture of her uh yeah you can unlock it hell yeah
208880	214560	um hey i hey i just answer and i'm like whoa she looks at keith and she's like
215200	220560	oh she answered she's right upstairs no mildred it's me it's john lee peter pennymore
221680	223840	i can't keep revealing my terrible secret
223840	236640	so she's gone i'm sorry to say mildred it seems like she is when will she be back we don't
237280	244480	rightly know i think around now is when clark starts to regain some of his faculties and he
245040	250640	goes over to mildred and said uh mildred uh yeah i don't i don't know where she went but you know
250720	254320	we're gonna find her we always find people we're looking for do you find john peters
255360	258640	that was yesterday we're working on it we actually are coming pretty close we think
259680	268480	uh she like reaches over to her ashtray relights that spliff and starts walking upstairs uh so in
268480	273600	until this room i want to do a couple things a has the camera reacted to being in here at all no
273600	278800	okay uh now that i've unlocked her phone i want to check her texts her facebook like messenger
278800	283440	anything i want to look at her communication see who she's talking to you know is she in a
283440	288480	facebook messenger group called like freaky death cult uh yeah she's in a freaky death cult no
288480	291280	basically what you would garner is that
294960	298400	i'm sorry there's so much tube technology
298400	302000	in this world
307600	312880	she was a pretty standoffish kid from what you can tell she clearly grew up maybe not clearly but she
312880	318880	grew up in this house with her grandma her parents are gone she's had a weird home life uh her
318880	326160	grandma raised her but was always stoned you would gather from her phone that she probably has uh
326160	333920	dabbled in in smoking some pot herself and uh you know normal kid stuff she's into tv shows and
333920	340640	you know movies and music and other things that people find uh enjoyable as hobbies looking
340640	345840	through her phone she seems like your typical teenager i don't know how she came across like
345840	351760	watching tv shows and movies and your typical enjoyable things yeah the kind of things that
351760	355040	people like wow how old a girl is she uh
359200	363040	mildred is sitting on her bed i feel like we were asking you and not mildred yeah
363840	370640	oh i definitely we saw her uh early high school freshman or sophomore probably cool probably
370640	376800	sophomore actually we'll go with sophomore she has a car hell yeah so she's pretty cool she's pretty
376800	381760	cool i'll do cash till he has a driver's license we should grab that we should grab that gun
382640	387920	before we forget okay so it seems like a troubled teen uh sneaking around her neighbor's abandoned
387920	394160	house find some spooky shit but i do you think she knew she would disappear or was she trying
394160	398720	to harm you she pointed it at you that's what i'm trying to say is i don't think she knew what this
398720	403680	was so she was gonna shoot me for entering her room she was gonna kill me somebody might have
403680	409840	gotten to her about having those things somebody besides julie maxwell purchased other items maybe
409840	414560	we should go back and find out who purchased those other items if there's a security footage
414560	419200	or anything like that if she said it was in the past week or so they might still have some that's
419200	423360	not a bad idea keith see if we can find some people snooping around that booth we've just
423360	427840	entered the room of like the mastermind of all of this and we're like she's a poor teeny and you're
427840	438240	like you'll never catch me alive did clark not mention that she said she twirled her mustache
440080	445120	it all happened real quick but she looks scared as all get out pointing that gun at me was it the
445120	450320	fear of a little girl about to shoot a police officer or a fear of a girl about to do something
450320	457360	metaphysical i think i think we i think we probably got both but i i would suspect that
457360	460880	she learned some things about what she had in her possession i think we should go back
460880	465120	to the metaphysical store hidden treasures forgotten treasures
467360	473520	i know they're closed but not for us uh they are closed but you see the same woman inside
473520	476960	she's like sweeping up give her a friendly way from outside and point to the door
477680	484160	i'm sorry um we're closed oh yeah man we're not here to shop we had some more questions related
484160	491280	to uh booth 504 oh oh okay i i guess come on in thank you man what what can i what can i assist
491280	498080	you with officers we were specifically wondering if you had any more records uh or receipts from
498080	504240	that booth you see that big book that she was going through and uh she looks at it walks over
504320	508560	and starts flipping through it well second question do you have any security cameras in here
510880	517760	yeah but they don't rightly work with they're mostly just the show the kids
517760	525840	yeah yeah and oh hey i want to come through on that roll it up uh 96 can i human her too
525840	532320	yeah let's not so um so yeah you you believe what you want to believe the truth is out there zack
532320	538400	and this old lady is a lying two-faced fuck she does have a face on the back of her head
542720	547520	as she's flipping through the through the big book gosh uh there were three items recently
547520	554640	bought from booth 504 there was a camera that was bought with a check and uh that was from
554640	562240	and she's done through julie julie maxwell another item was uh put on uh the tab uh by
563120	568880	marie jacobs marie marie has a tab uh yeah she come in here pretty often i'd say so what sort
568880	574640	of things does she usually buy well what was that item on the tab it's a radio yeah it says a radio
574640	583920	and then uh there was another item uh uh a helmet that was uh it was put on a credit card you have
583920	588880	a name on that card man it's uh the first church of contention this might be a strange question do
588880	597520	you remember all of these items being tubed um i didn't sell all of them i don't rightly remember
597520	602000	that's fine do you remember who from the church purchased that helmet i i wasn't here for that
602000	606880	but who would be purchasing things on the who has a credit card to the church do you think do you
606880	612560	know clark who would have that you religious clark probably not i don't think john lee is
612560	617280	but i think he definitely would have spent time around a church growing up what is the first
617280	622160	church of contention baptist Scientologist it's uh we're not it's just the first church of
622160	626880	contention we're not gonna call it one denomination is more evil than the other they're all pretty

656720	662560	contention do you know anything about that helmet is it a bike helmet it just says helmet okay did
662560	668560	anybody else come in asking about these did julie maxwell maybe ask you about who had bought some
668560	679600	more of these things um no just inside i only asked because we found the uh dr marie jacobs

938000	944000	out the door of forgotten treasures you see a white toyota in the road and it peels off
944560	948240	i throw on my taxidermy hat and get my cruiser and take off after it
950240	953440	okay for uh what what are your dexterity's the three of you

971600	978880	your taxidermy hat on i've got it i've got it held low and tight and it's it's it's business
979120	983920	what was it again dude it's been two months do you remember what it was
985040	990720	i think it was like we haven't gotten to hear that episode so i have no idea like faces like
990720	995120	together or something we'll find out later something crazy so it bumps the top of the
995120	999840	cruiser like you didn't have to set it on the seat uh clark what do you do i'm already running
999840	1006080	toward my car not even that's the reaction absolutely i'm wheeling over there uh are you
1006080	1011600	with me help me throw this into your trunk and i hop out of my wheelchair i run back around grab
1011600	1015200	the wheelchair and throw it in the like the back seat and i get in the i get in the passenger seat
1015200	1027200	and say i hit the roof of the car did you hear that yeah it worked really well luke just slapped
1027200	1039120	the top of his head john lee pettymore roll me a drive check oh god damn it 82 on a 70 amazing
1039840	1046080	all right the hat gets in my eyes and i have a really hard time getting the car started clark
1046080	1056240	uh roll a drive check as well 42 on a 50 nice so as you guys go off you see the white toyota
1056240	1065200	as it peeled off it actually ran a bit off the road up onto the curb and had to back up as to
1065760	1071200	like to avoid hitting a sign on the side of the road and then gets back on the road and as it
1071200	1076320	is going north on the road from forgotten treasures clark you are in position right
1076320	1083760	behind the white toyota and john lee pettymore you are taking up the rear right behind clark bishop
1084720	1092160	as you are driving there's an intersection approaching and the white toyota is going
1092160	1097120	to drive straight through the red light clark what do you do real fast my assessment of the
1097120	1104320	situation can i see if is there more than one person in the car roll me in a search
1104320	1118080	fail 61 i also wonder that i pass a 34 on a 40 uh keith you see there is one person in the driver's
1118080	1123920	seat of the white toyota cool clark how are you handling the situation from a driving perspective
1124800	1131680	there is traffic going horizontally i do it like a ambulance would so lights on siren on and just
1131680	1135840	cautiously but still trying to maintain as much speed as i can but still seeing how safe i can be
1135840	1140000	about the oncoming traffic if i'm if they're stopping i'm going but if they're don't look
1140000	1146240	like they're stopping i'm not going through okay yeah he is going to go through the intersection
1146240	1152160	and john lee pettymart full speed i peel around him and i'm not really looking okay i need you
1152160	1161520	both to roll another drive check for me fail on mine if i roll 70 on a 70 is that a fail no that
1161520	1168320	is a great success okay cool it's a really really quite good success very lucky the white toyota
1168320	1177120	swerves out of the way of the traffic as he goes through the intersection nimbly dodging a car
1177120	1184240	clark bishop you are about to hit a car coming in from the right too hot didn't see your sirens
1184240	1190560	didn't uh didn't hear you so you have to like hit the brakes yeah in order to uh avoid a collision
1190560	1197040	there as john lee petty more just like slides like through the intersection and flies through
1197040	1202000	it on the tail of the white toyota keith what do you want to do i'm gonna flash my gun at the
1202000	1210640	person that almost just hit us and point out and then i nod my head and i go yeah yeah then i say
1210640	1218240	hit it i do okay so now the pursuit is still heading north on that same road the white toyota
1218240	1228400	is going like 60 65 miles an hour on a 45 and gaining speed john lee petty morn it is up to you
1228400	1233920	what you want to do next i'm just still in hot pursuit you're basically right behind this white
1233920	1240800	toyota so what maneuvers are you going to take i assume my police cruiser has more power so i'm
1240800	1245200	just going to try to get ahead of him and make him stop or run off the road how close is he to
1245200	1251200	the white toyota how close are we to the white toyota i would say john lee petty more is roughly
1251200	1256720	10 yards 15 yards behind the white toyota and you guys are 20 yards behind his cruiser you
1256720	1261120	can just call him a channel okay i see that john has the lead on this one so i'm whatever he does
1261120	1264880	even if he does manage to get to the side or around it i'm gonna still kind of be taking up
1264880	1269680	the rear in case that car goes off i think we should try to get up close too because i can get
1269680	1274480	the shotgun out of the back and try to take out his tires okay because i got pretty good firearms
1274480	1277680	okay i'll do that i'll get a little closer if you can pull up to the side i'll try to get up
1277680	1284960	to the back and i'll be like cop loudspeaker just like pull over stop the vehicle okay six so i'm
1284960	1299120	going to roll okay so here's what happens john as you pull behind this uh this white toyota you see
1299120	1306080	a hand go out the driver's side window with a something that is on fire in the hand and he
1306080	1313200	throws a bottle molotov cocktail awesome and it is flying through the air i need you to
1313760	1320320	roll against his throw on a drive check in order to avoid the molotov cocktail heading straight
1320320	1330160	for your windshield five as you swerve you manage to avoid the cocktail hitting your windshield
1330160	1337600	exactly but it does catch the the back corner of your car and and you're not sure whether or not
1337600	1345040	a fire has started or whether or not just the exterior of your car is on fire currently clark
1345040	1354080	you and keith see a small explosion in the back right of john's car and glass seems to just
1354080	1360160	shatter off in in that direction as you guys are pulling up closer this is the most alive
1360160	1365920	john has felt since his racing days holy shit did that guy just throw a molotov cocktail
1365920	1370000	i think he did dude we gotta take this guy out i already have reached back and picked up the
1370000	1373680	shotgun and i'm waiting to roll my window down until we can get close enough to him because i
1373680	1379760	don't want no fire in this car okay i think he had to slow down enough and john clearly like
1379760	1385040	swerved to the left and you guys pulled up right next to him so the two of you are side by side
1385040	1390240	with the white toyota right in between you right ahead of you clark is there anything you want to
1390240	1395120	do maneuver wise while you're driving or are you just trying to i mean always getting closer into
1395120	1402560	maybe his right side there's a passenger side now okay awesome so let's go ahead and do another
1402560	1411840	drive roll off all both of you and i'll roll for for the white toyota as well fuck 89 on a 50 90
1411840	1419360	on a 70 okay the white toyota failed his check as well so you're still in the same positions moving
1419360	1425440	forward but you are heading directly for a t so there's no straight there's only right or left
1425440	1433360	coming up and the white toyota is going to whip it to the right so as you guys hit this turn
1433360	1437920	let's do one more check to see if anything changes if he's with jostling and i was already on the
1437920	1442320	right can i try and t-bone him or i don't know if it'd be a t-bone but maybe like half pit maneuver
1442320	1447120	to hit his back side to get him spinning yeah absolutely i want to try to shoot out his front
1447120	1451600	right tire as well okay and how are you doing that hanging out the passenger seat with the
1451600	1465840	shotgun and just awesome okay so let's get those drive rolls a two on a 50 nice 63 on a 70 63 and
1465840	1469840	what are you trying to do i guess as we come up to that t and i see him turning right i'm just
1469840	1475280	going to try to do some late braking and pass him on the turn basically awesome roll the firearms
1475520	1481360	please keith 21 on a 70 awesome and you were aiming for a tire front right tire yeah as he
1481360	1488640	takes this right turn clark you try to fishtail him you make connection however he turns into it
1488640	1497200	and begins to avoid the fishtail maneuver however keith vigna blows his front right tire as he's
1497200	1504160	doing so which would pull him harder right hard right yeah so that is going to complete the fish
1504160	1509280	tail and make that a success and john you can yeah has i mean has this pretty much brought him
1509280	1514320	to a stop uh he's gonna be sideways here in a second yeah and probably just like right in the
1514320	1520640	middle of the street okay once we stop i'm gonna jump out have my shotgun trained on him and stand
1520640	1525760	there until you guys can move to get him out because i'm not trying to pop around so john
1525760	1530560	what are you doing where's your car going i'll just go around to the rear of his car since you
1530560	1534160	guys are in a position to go like to block him from the front we can just get them blocked in
1534160	1540320	basically yeah are are you picturing our car i'm picturing me my car and his car parallel facing
1540320	1544720	opposite directions oh okay i was picturing you okay then i'll get in front of him yeah and you
1544720	1549360	guys get behind him or whatever yeah that's good so i've got shotgun trained as soon as you get out
1549360	1556240	of the car you've got a shotgun in your hands and he is going to begin firing at you okay are you
1556320	1562480	going to attempt to take cover or fire back so if i was coming up to his passenger side i'm gonna
1562480	1567440	jump towards the back of his car so that he doesn't have a good aim on me and try to like get
1567440	1572400	by the trunk of his car and kind of take cover and try to i want to get a good shot on him but i'm not
1572400	1576320	i don't want to like shoot at him yet i don't want to try to kill him but i want to get at a good
1576320	1582000	angle where he can't hit me but i could if i had to get him absolutely so he he fires a few shots
1582000	1586880	breaks out the glass of his uh the on the passenger side of the white toyota and then
1586880	1591760	in the passenger backseat side he shoots out that glass too as he's trying to get at you
1591760	1597920	i believe that would make it john's turn john tries to remember his training like officers
1597920	1604480	are under fire so cops would just be like wasting this dude for sure yeah but but we we need him
1604480	1610800	yeah that's why i didn't just immediately blow his fucking head off can we uh can we tell from
1610800	1615280	the shots or see what kind of gun he's using is it just a pistol it's a pistol yeah so how many
1615280	1622000	shots has he fired off at this point four couple i'll pop out of my cruiser and keep talking to him
1622000	1629280	through the intercom put down your weapon we just want to talk maybe you know about this goo can i
1629280	1634080	from my angle see if i know this guy have i seen him before i know that this is charles's car
1634080	1639040	do it can i tell it's charles yeah okay it looks like charles i'm gonna be on my intercom using
1639040	1648880	his name charles come on settle come on what was that voice come on hey hey charles big
1648880	1652880	old thing of helium right before charles stop shooting at him stop shooting at him
1654800	1659440	all right t what do you do okay i want to try to get around to the like passenger side of the
1659440	1665520	trunk and see is he still in inside of his car yeah with all the doors closed yeah if i like
1665520	1670640	pop up pop up over the trunk and look and see inside of his car through the back window is his
1670640	1675760	arm still out like trying to shoot or like what can i see looking inside i mean yeah he's in the
1675760	1681600	front he's in the driver's seat he is looking your direction he's kind of looking all around
1681600	1688080	but he just fired back through there and so he's panicky how would you feel if i was him bad
1688080	1692000	probably probably not good probably like a shouldn't have broken the law
1692000	1698880	um can i try to like open up the well shit that's stupid what do you do no that's what do you do i
1699920	1704720	fire off a warning shot of the shotgun to where maybe like a couple pellets hit like the side of
1704720	1712480	his ear or his head the rest just go like like a like a like a but not right at him okay so
1712480	1719680	you're firing away from him into the car yeah but you're not firing across his face bow i'm
1719680	1726080	not trying to like shoot directly into his head okay but like if a little spray gets on him
1727200	1731040	okay roll firearms for me i fail
1735760	1738880	and you had a shotgun so go ahead and
1738880	1751360	uh let's see is that essentially a called shot like yeah like near it like not trying to hit
1751360	1756800	someone is just as hard as hitting someone exactly where you want to also i am thinking this is like
1756800	1763040	buckshot not like a slug yeah yeah he just wanted to grace his face right with a couple pellets not
1763040	1770320	all the pain refreshing spray mist of pellets yeah wake him up a little bit it's so good
1770880	1773200	yeah so go ahead and roll 2d6 for me
1779920	1781680	shit okay um
1785600	1792240	so you uh you blast into this car you were trying to shoot to the right of him
1792240	1798000	but you really you just fired directly into the back of his seat there is a mist of red
1799840	1808640	going all over the front of the car as the horn begins to blare and the slumped body of charles
1808640	1815120	is leaning directly into the steering wheel his face making the horn incessant
1815120	1822880	john lee pettimore lets off a couple of panic shots towards the van when he sees all that
1822880	1829440	happen as the as the windshield just like turns red all of a sudden he just a couple and where

2044800	2050240	couple more shots into the air and tell them to disperse roll firearms what are we around up up
2050240	2056160	here 59 on a 60 how big of a crowd are we talking here it's not there's like like three hundreds of
2056160	2061280	people gathered there's like four people who stopped what they're doing to watch and a couple
2061280	2066320	cars like two cars have pulled over and they're just sitting there staring phones out do they
2066320	2072160	take off when i shoot in the air do you actually shoot yeah oh then yeah they leave okay uh-huh
2072880	2077440	one of the people just gets into somebody else's car and they they're nice enough to take them out
2077440	2082320	of this scary situation that's how you maintain law and order i cast obliviate on them so they
2082320	2088400	forget what they just saw harry potter universe canon now okay so as you guys are looking through
2088400	2093360	this car you see there's a there's a handgun in his hand in the seat next to him there's a
2093360	2099440	different handgun does it have any crazy um features no they both look relatively normal
2099440	2106160	handguns uh there's also a mag light sitting in the shotgun seat and in the back seat there's a
2106720	2113120	rifle a burner phone a wallet and some keys all in the back seat all in the back seat i want to
2113120	2116880	look at that burner phone too what numbers are stored in there i'm gonna grab the wallet as you
2116880	2122240	look through the burner phone everything has been deleted off of it there's literally no information
2122240	2129280	on it whatsoever and as you open up the wallet there's an army id for a billy harrison he's a
2129280	2135280	pretty nondescript dude pretty young he doesn't look like charles he's bald no it's not charles
2135280	2142080	pretty fit dude bald guy young guy probably in his uh late 20s early 30s wouldn't it say on the id
2142080	2151200	he's got shut up he's got pretty intense eyes he is 29. anything uh interesting about the keys
2151200	2157920	particularly if they have a storage unit it's a key ring with one car key on it does it seem like
2157920	2163520	this toyota was his can i check the glove box the keys to the toyota are still in the toyota
2163520	2169680	what is in the glove box there is almost nothing in the glove box there's like the manual for the
2169680	2175680	there's not like any interest no there's no registration on the one key on the one key ring
2175680	2182400	is there a make of the car did we check the trunk yet did we check the trunk yet it's a van right
2182400	2188160	are we checking trunk yet an suv what is it toyota toyota i think i was picturing a white carola
2188160	2192000	for some reason i was picturing like a tundra i actually just pictured us chasing a ford bronco
2192000	2198080	this whole time if i did it by charles the guy just killed him we'll say dodge why not dodge
2198080	2203120	how about dodge on the key ring john lee pettymore i want to check the trunk too since i'm already
2203120	2212400	back here okay so as you pop open the trunk there is a man is completely unconscious is it billy
2212400	2220720	harrison he looks exactly like billy harrison he is alive though yeah he's unconscious he's
2220720	2228640	unconscious and he is wearing a black t-shirt and jeans is there anything else yeah underneath him
2228640	2236400	also in the trunk is a police uniform a set of scrubs and a black suit this guy likes costume
2236400	2241600	parties can i try to wake him up is he tied up or is he just stuck back there conscious his hands
2241600	2250160	are bound with a chain spooky uh i want to try to wake him up shake him shake him up clark as you
2250160	2258800	are going over charles he has id on him named charles donovan he is from the city he's got a
2258800	2267680	burner phone on him and he has a piece of paper two addresses on the piece of paper you recognize
2267680	2274640	them both immediately one is john peter's house and the other is the piston pig farm
2275360	2283120	the keys that are in the ignition of the white toyota include a key to a room at the motel my
2283120	2288800	motel the one that keith vigna is staying at and there is a key fob for dirty dog grooming
2289360	2296960	charles donovan also has scratches all over his arms legs and face do they look like
2296960	2304000	scratches from a dog or a human those are the only two or like brushes brush if he was running
2304080	2309600	oh yeah are they claw marks i think that would be easy they're not claw marks okay i like what
2309600	2315520	you're thinking uh but no yeah his skin is definitely uh red and irritable looking as if
2315520	2320720	it has been scratched repeatedly in multiple places but not not breaking the skin like
2320720	2327680	they're not wounds a couple seem to have bled but mostly not and no discernible pattern no so
2327680	2333680	it doesn't look like he got scratched up by brush or something not really okay no well now what
2334000	2337440	there's a lot we could do actually uh let me look at the burner phone in his pocket
2337440	2341440	there is nothing on it yeah no it's it's wiped clean
2343520	2347760	shit not even like a recent calls list what was the last selfie he took
2349600	2354320	holding the molotov you should show it to his family no he wouldn't have any recent calls
2354320	2361360	there he would have deleted him by now keith you are slapping this bald man
2361360	2368480	in the back of the trunk and he's not waking up your slapping is not helping guys look what i
2368480	2375440	found who i found could we do a search rule to like more intensely search the vehicle sure
2376400	2385840	one holy shit 13 on a 20 i get it also not as good as him okay he starts the fuck out of this
2385840	2391280	car though maybe a tantalizing piece of information that might have escaped his lips before his chest
2391280	2401280	was exploded john as you are looking over the stuff you decide to pull out dump them all on the
2401280	2408160	ground yeah you dump it all out in the middle of the road the police uniform that he has matches
2408160	2415840	the police uniform that the three of you wear here in contention okay and he has a badge on there
2415840	2422800	a real badge you would know that it's not but it looks and no other identification like it says
2422800	2429840	officer kissel is it a contention badge yeah is it pretty good yeah no this is like a pretty good
2429840	2440560	fake the set of scrubs has an id that says dr zebrowski and the black suit inside one of the
2440560	2448160	pockets has fbi credentials for an agent parks does the do the scrubs have a name of a hospital
2448160	2454880	on them no good question what do we have in contention just like a clinic correct and then
2454880	2461280	the city has a hospital oh also with your search role sorry because you critically succeeded
2461280	2467840	as you're looking over charles's body helping clark discern the scratches that are all over him
2467840	2478240	you see that the scratches are in the pattern of of hands and it looks like a human human's hands
2479280	2485520	made all these scratches all over charles okay so i guess i would like to get drew looking up
2485520	2490720	all these credentials to see if there actually is a dr zebrowski somewhere in state following up on
2490720	2497040	the fbi credentials for agent parks see if that's a real person and then uh john is gonna go over
2497040	2503600	and start changing the tire on clark's cruiser nice it feels bad about that the ambulance arrives
2503600	2508160	on the scene before they get to either body i'm gonna have them take a look at my foot
2510640	2514640	you got anything for this yeah does this count as a hospital visit
2516160	2518240	can you roll to get some foot hit points back
2518240	2529840	yeah i like that go ahead and roll d4 or that's a d6
2534720	2540640	that's what you get uh they throw a band-aid at you now they um they have a splint with them that
2540640	2545600	you can throw on and it'll make walking much easier charles is dead so i'd like to direct
2545600	2554160	them to um trying to wake up billy yeah they attempt to bring billy harrison to consciousness
2554160	2561120	and do not succeed and immediately they're like we got to get him help they throw him on a stretcher
2561120	2565280	and put him in the back of the ambulance i'm gonna go with him in the ambulance just in case
2565280	2571360	he's a bad guy or if he's a good guy i can ask him too perfect i grab keith don't kill this one man
2571360	2580560	i'm not a murderer not this one uh keith go ahead and roll sanity for me real quick for murdering
2581840	2585600	charles 18 on a 40 nice
2588720	2593280	justified police action in the line of duty i mean this is is this the first time i've
2593280	2597440	killed someone i would think so i think yeah this is my first murder by cop how many people
