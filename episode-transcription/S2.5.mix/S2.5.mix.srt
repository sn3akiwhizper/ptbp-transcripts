1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Hello, my little listeners.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,160
It's your big beefy brisket wolf, the dog.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,280
And I'm here to sizzle myself up and feed myself

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,120
to all of my hungry little babies.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,640
Make sure and take a Pepto, baby,

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,240
because I don't go down smooth.

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,800
I am digesting it, y'all, live from 694.2 PTBP,

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,920
the best radio show that also operates

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,640
as a pop-up barbecue restaurant.

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,680
While we digest and digress,

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,120
why not see what the adoring public

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,400
is saying about us, shall we?

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,360
I hope I impress.

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,320
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from KDB in West Virginia,

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,680
who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Park.

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,800
A quick and easy way to make wolf feel loved and supported.

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,960
KDB writes, hello, coming at you from the land

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,760
of the cryptids, almost heaven, West Virginia.

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,160
I've been listening since early season one,

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,480
and I'm loving all the eldritch horror

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,240
y'all bring into my day.

22
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,440
Thanks for your absolutely inspired characters,

23
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,760
stories, editing, and for spicing up my music taste.

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,880
Shout out to my friend, Sid,

25
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,360
who I will eventually convince to listen

26
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,840
to this podcast alongside me.

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,880
And stay safe out there, wolf.

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,680
We can't have the horrors that be stopping you

29
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,040
from your wonderful hosting.

30
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,240
Horrors that be stopping me?

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,680
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,960
If there's one thing you should know, KDB in West Virginia,

33
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,400
it's that the horrors that be should be terrified of me.

34
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,520
There is no horror that I cannot simply consume.

35
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,880
Any deranged beings out there that don't fear respect me

36
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,520
simply haven't witnessed my capacity.

37
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,760
If you want to write up something

38
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,160
for your big beefy wolf to how,

39
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,760
make a notification pop up on one of my many devices.

40
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,320
How, you may ask?

41
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,440
Just play some golf inside the libretto.

42
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,600
That's right, the links are in the show notes.

43
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,680
Oh, and I'm getting word here that my producer wants to add

44
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,560
that also in those sweet delicious network revisions

45
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,560
wrapped sausages are portals to our Patreon and merch shop.

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,200
Let's make a deal.

47
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,080
You slip me some greasy dollars

48
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,600
and I'll keep reading the news.

49
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,320
Last time, Julius blacked out at the foundry

50
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,440
after his liquid inauguration

51
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,680
into the 24 hour city news family.

52
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,160
But Beck and Cal actually remembered

53
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,000
the evening's post printing press.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,480
Beck was heckled by his disappointed mother Kim

55
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,920
and Cal had an endearing heart to heart

56
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,760
with his daughter Carol, which is great.

57
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll bet his story continues to be wholesome and delightful

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,480
and definitely will not devolve into unadulterated madness.

59
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,440
Probably, but keep your chin up.

60
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,440
I've got a fresh little ditty here

61
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,120
for our fifth episode of season two.

62
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,520
Prepare yourself for a brand new theme song.

63
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,520
It's altar girl with my life is great and it's all my fault.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And it's all my fault

65
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Cause my life is great

66
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,160
And it's all mine

67
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,640
Cause my life is great

68
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,480
And it's all my fault

69
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,920
Dude, I just remember this, but last night

70
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,960
I woke up in the middle of the night

71
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,960
cause I like thought I was choking.

72
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,760
Well, it was like, I was having a dream

73
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,360
where I thought I was choking.

74
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,080
Then I woke up, do what?

75
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,240
On D's nest.

76
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,440
No, I woke up and both sides of my nose were bleeding

77
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,200
and I was just like breathing it in.

78
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,720
And then this morning when I took a shower,

79
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,000
I was like, Oh, I got to blow my nose.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,840
And I blew out a chunk of like dried blood

81
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,640
that was like this fucking long.

82
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,360
It was rad and disgusting.

83
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,200
My dad gets them all the time from doing cocaine

84
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,680
and I get them all the time

85
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,680
cause my dad made me do cocaine when I was a little kid.

86
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,800
It's cool. Your dad sounds cool.

87
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,920
Well, it is cool.

88
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,200
Cause you're like, yeah, I know somebody

89
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,680
can get you cocaine.

90
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,960
My dad, my cool dad.

91
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,400
This is my mom and my plug.

92
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,120
In that order, I love my mom.

93
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,840
Fade up on Tuesday, July 5th.

94
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,080
It's the Tuesday morning meeting here at Cannes.

95
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,320
And as you're looking around the room,

96
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,800
you notice that the producer of city action news,

97
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,360
Ty for Rayland is nowhere to be found.

98
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,120
He's normally at the big chair

99
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,400
at the head of the table here at this long table

100
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,520
in this beautiful conference room.

101
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,600
Isabella Kaya, the head anchor city action news,

102
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,760
who was once co-anchor with Cal Colorado,

103
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,400
but now is the sole lead of city action news.

104
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,400
She walks forward to the front of the room

105
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,840
and stands at the head of the table.

106
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,240
Hello everyone.

107
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,760
Thank you all so much for being here today.

108
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,680
As you may have heard, Ty for Rayland,

109
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,880
our beautiful boss is out having a meeting

110
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,360
at the city tower with the who's who and whatnot.

111
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,760
So I'll be handing out assignments today.

112
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,640
Quick question, just as a newsman.

113
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,120
Cal raises his hand.

114
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,720
Who is who and what is what not?

115
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,720
She giggles to herself and gives a massive eye roll

116
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,480
to the sports person and the news person who work here.

117
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,760
And their names both start with S and their names are?

118
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,160
Howard Chesh is the weatherman.

119
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,280
Shay Star.

120
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,640
And Shay Star, nice, well done.

121
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,480
I knew Shay Star, that's two S's.

122
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,400
It's two S's, Shay Star, well done.

123
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,160
You said the meeting was at city tower, you called it?

124
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,200
Yeah, the city tower.

125
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,600
And it's shaped like the Teen Titans building.

126
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,760
I'm here for that.

127
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,600
You like that?

128
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,440
Yeah, I like that.

129
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,000
That's a little local reference for Springfield listeners.

130
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,440
All four of us.

131
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,840
Springfield is the headquarters of the Teen Titans.

132
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,160
Dude, the Hammond's tower is the Teen Titans building.

133
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,480
Yeah, but I was picturing the Teen Titans tower.

134
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,240
Which is one in the same.

135
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,400
Okay, no, it's not.

136
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,400
It's similar looking.

137
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,520
The Teen Titans is a giant T.

138
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,600
And the Hammond's tower has giant T's

139
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,320
on the side of all four sides.

140
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,480
No, it has like.

141
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,320
Anyway, Julius says.

142
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,400
Slightly larger section at the top.

143
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,960
It's like a big blob at the top.

144
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,400
The T on top of the Teen Titans tower

145
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,040
is literally as long as the building itself.

146
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,040
I'm not saying that Hammond's tower

147
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,160
looks exactly the same as Teen Titans tower,

148
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,440
but I'm saying if Hammond's tower looks like anything,

149
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,240
it looks like the Teen Titans tower.

150
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,760
Luke, I got your back on that.

151
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,760
That looks like a caricature of Hammond's tower.

152
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,760
Joe, you're right, that looks exactly

153
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,480
like the Teen Titans tower.

154
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,360
You're right.

155
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,320
Motherfuckers.

156
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,000
The Hammond's tower is literally a giant T, bro.

157
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,360
No, man, it's like an I with no bottom piece.

158
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,600
It's like an I with no bottom piece, so like a T?

159
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,360
No, man, how do you draw your I's?

160
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,380
Like a T with a bottom T.

161
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,440
Hey, guys, Google the Hammond's tower

162
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,840
in Springfield, Missouri and tell me I'm not fucking wrong.

163
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,480
Tell me, Google it, tweet at Luke Ginniman in 69.

164
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,440
I know right I am, at indoor two underscores living.

165
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,520
The Hammond's tower would be,

166
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,000
the Hammond's tower looks like a T

167
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,560
if you like chopped its arms off at the shoulder.

168
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,200
I mean, look at this picture, it's a T.

169
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,240
If you ignore most of the building.

170
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,560
Okay, this is a stupid discussion.

171
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,040
No, this is what the people wanna hear.

172
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,840
They wanna hear about happiness.

173
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,480
Yeah, look at that, right?

174
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,960
I think that you would be hard pressed

175
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,640
to find anybody who wouldn't go, huh,

176
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,300
when you saw that.

177
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,280
Huh, looks a lot like the teen Titan building.

178
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,840
Joe has shown us a reasonably damning comparison.

179
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,840
You guys just don't wanna believe the things I say

180
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,440
cause guess what, I speak the truth.

181
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,680
So he's busy at a meeting at the city tower,

182
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,720
but you guys are here in the conference room

183
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,000
at City Action News Studios,

184
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,960
where Isabel Acaya is handing out the assignments.

185
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,920
Okay, Cal, I actually got you something pretty great.

186
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,400
It's an exclusive.

187
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,480
Yeah, you with me?

188
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,320
Asclusi.

189
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,080
Yeah, oh, I love it when you use my language.

190
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,200
Yes, you got Asclusi.

191
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,080
Under his breath, he's like,

192
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,660
I taught you to say Sclusi.

193
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,880
Cal stabs his leg with his pin under the table.

194
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,140
This Sclusi is just for you, Cal,

195
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,520
and your whole team here.

196
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,480
Just so you guys know,

197
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,280
I'm texting my uncle to see what's up.

198
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,840
He makes sure to interrupt her on that.

199
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,100
Okay, are you done?

200
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,080
Julius, it's not polite to interrupt, especially women.

201
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,060
I act like I didn't say anything.

202
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,680
Okay, weird.

203
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,000
Okay, so yeah, it's Asclusi with the Gato company.

204
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,840
It's Asclusi on the Gato company.

205
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,960
Apparently they have this secret company town

206
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,400
and someone out there is gonna show you around apparently.

207
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,960
I don't know, Fred Gottel,

208
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,480
and kind of the whole crowd is like,

209
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,320
holy crap, won't be there.

210
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,440
And everyone's like, ugh.

211
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,080
As you know, he likes to be on camera as little as possible

212
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,520
when he's not fully in control of the narrative,

213
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,400
you know, as those big boys like to do.

214
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,400
So there's actually just a dropped pin for the address.

215
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,800
Not sure what that's about.

216
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,640
Actually, this might just be like a wild goose chase,

217
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,480
who knows?

218
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,580
Like who dropped the pin, though?

219
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,040
Can't reveal the source at this time, I'm being told.

220
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,360
I mean, I could take a look at that

221
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,400
and I might be able to find a trace

222
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,020
of who maybe dropped the pin or whatever.

223
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,680
Oh, okay, yeah, cool.

224
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,000
On your way out, just see who was the PA,

225
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,080
who was the intern who was running for you guys.

226
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,680
Oh, that's a fantastic question.

227
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,960
He can't look Julius in the eye right now

228
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
because of what happened during the printing press.

229
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,120
Ha ha ha!

230
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,680
He ripped my fucking...

231
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,240
Yeah, it's the one who ripped your shirt off

232
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,800
because he was like fucking plastic.

233
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,920
During the rip, I can't wear that suit anymore.

234
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,760
During the rip.

235
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,200
I don't remember a lot from that night,

236
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,120
but I do remember who did that to me.

237
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,140
Somebody get the intern, what's his name?

238
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,680
And literally no one in the room can remember his name.

239
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,120
And this like very haphazard looking,

240
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,400
bug-eyed boy comes running in.

241
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,840
He's like, yeah, sorry, what did you guys want?

242
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,040
You got the phone where we got the tip with the dropped pin?

243
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,000
He's like, oh yeah.

244
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,200
And he brings you a, who would it be from?

245
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Who would get the tip?

246
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,080
Like who would have this dropped pin?

247
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,560
There's just like the constant emails that come in

248
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,000
and they scour through like what is the intern.

249
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,840
The email goblin.

250
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,800
All of the messages incoming from social media

251
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,760
and stuff come to my phone.

252
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,580
So yeah, it's this.

253
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,680
And he hands you his phone

254
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,760
and immediately disappears out of the room.

255
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,200
Okay, yeah, so that's all I need from you guys

256
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,300
if you wanna head out.

257
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,680
That's, I think I read it was 83.6 miles away.

258
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,000
So you're gonna wanna get out.

259
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,700
That way you can get back in time.

260
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,880
Cal is kind of confused.

261
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,160
He's like, so we'll find the pin out there

262
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,140
that someone dropped?

263
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,920
Yeah, and she like smiles at the rest of the room.

264
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,400
Julius gets up from his seat and looks at her

265
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,400
and it's like, oh yeah, by the way, my uncle says hi.

266
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,220
And he at no point has texted his uncle.

267
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,200
She just kind of blinks at you for a second.

268
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,280
Who are you?

269
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,360
Julius makes a mental note and goes to walk near Cal.

270
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,640
Oh, you're producing for Mr. Cal.

271
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,120
Mr. Cal, have a good time.

272
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,020
Bye.

273
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,160
Thank you, Isabella.

274
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,180
I certainly will.

275
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,940
Can I catch the intern that's walking away?

276
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

277
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,140
As you guys head out out of the conference room

278
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,220
and heading out towards the front door,

279
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,940
you see him, he's pacing back and forth somewhere.

280
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,460
He's just like talking to himself.

281
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,940
I just kind of do a quick run up to him.

282
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,340
Hey man, can I like check out the email that you got

283
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,380
that had this pin in it?

284
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,340
Yeah, absolutely.

285
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,140
And he takes the phone from you and scrolls through it

286
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,100
and clicks on it and hands it back to you.

287
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,860
Perfect, then I'm gonna start searching this phone

288
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,700
with either CompSci or Cygant.

289
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,980
Oh yeah, go CompSci on it.

290
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,460
Go computer science, please.

291
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,220
I'm trying to find, go fucking CompSci on that phone.

292
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,820
I'm doing like hackery stuff to find IP addresses

293
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,420
and all sorts of things.

294
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,420
In the meantime, I do want to text my uncle

295
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,700
and like see what's up.

296
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,180
Luke, you can text your uncle.

297
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,300
That was always allowed.

298
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,740
I know, that's why I just did it.

299
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,260
Oh, he's doing it in game now though.

300
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,900
Oh, oh.

301
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,340
Could you text your actual uncle and tell him I say hi?

302
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,620
Which one?

303
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,460
Either.

304
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,680
Dave or, I'm not gonna text Dave, fuck Dave.

305
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,520
No, text Dave.

306
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,840
I'll text Donny.

307
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,680
Donny's a cool one.

308
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,080
Luke gave the shocker when he said that.

309
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,680
Joe, what'd you roll?

310
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,560
There's a 65 on a 60.

311
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,240
Oh, do you want to spend luck?

312
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,140
I ain't got it.

313
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,280
Oh, shit.

314
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,040
Okay, for some reason it's coming from a blocked IP.

315
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,880
It seems that it was run through.

316
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,880
You can tell it's actually a specific IP that VPNs use

317
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,920
and you recognize it as being like,

318
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,840
oh, they blocked where they came from.

319
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,720
Ah, dang, this guy's a little bit tricky, guys.

320
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,220
We might want to have our wits about us.

321
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,040
I don't know if this is like above board or whatever

322
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,000
because they're like hiding their tracks.

323
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
He's a little bit tricky,

324
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,760
but I'm a little bit rock and roll.

325
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,920
I think we can do it.

326
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,640
I've actually just texted my uncle

327
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,240
to see if he has any information about this story.

328
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,240
I mean, at the end of the day,

329
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,480
it's like a follow-up to the story we did in the corn

330
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,760
in the crab farm, right?

331
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,520
Cal like gives you a pained expression for a second

332
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,840
thinking about that day.

333
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,720
I suppose so.

334
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,860
I was also speaking in jest earlier.

335
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,140
I prefer jazz.

336
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,280
Oh, I know.

337
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,440
I knew it was a joke, dude.

338
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
It was a good one, man.

339
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,680
Oh, thank you.

340
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,720
Anchor good?

341
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,640
Oh, dude, of course, anchor good.

342
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,760
Thank you, Beck.

343
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,680
Either way, we should definitely get out there.

344
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,720
The door of the conference room swings open wide real quick

345
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,560
and Isabelle Lacaya is standing there

346
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,840
and she's like, oh yeah, shit, one more thing,

347
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,120
completely forgot, slipped my mind.

348
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,320
We figured you might need another pair of hands

349
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,440
since this seems like whatever.

350
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,400
You don't know what it is.

351
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,280
So we figured since you're out for the day,

352
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,160
we'll send a PA with you.

353
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,440
She said her name was Stevie

354
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,200
and then Isabelle Lacaya disappears

355
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,580
back into the conference room.

356
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,480
And you see Stevie is a scrawny little dude

357
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,640
wearing cigarette-legged jeans

358
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,800
in an oversized black hoodie.

359
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,640
She has earbuds plugged into her ear holes

360
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,720
and a thick wall of dark wavy hair

361
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,720
covering their eyes, nose, and top lip

362
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,540
only revealing a black lipstick-covered bottom lip

363
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,480
pierced with a small hoop.

364
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,880
And you say they don't have ears, just holes?

365
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,520
Well, the earbuds themselves are plugged into the holes.

366
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,100
There are the flappy parts around.

367
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,940
Hi.

368
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,580
Hello, Stevie, your ears are normally flappy.

369
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,940
I'm Cal Colorado.

370
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,620
Hi, Mr. Colorado, it's nice to meet you.

371
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,860
I'm Stevie, can I get you anything?

372
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,100
Hi, Stevie, it's nice to meet you guys.

373
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,260
What's your name?

374
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,080
Is this the first time that Beck would've met this person?

375
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,360
Because it sounds like somebody

376
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,060
who Beck would be friends with, for sure.

377
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,380
Yeah, this is a new, you've known it.

378
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,060
Hey, Stevie, what's going on?

379
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,900
Good to meet you.

380
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,500
Hi, yeah, it's nice to meet you too.

381
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,840
I like your vibe.

382
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,360
I'm digging yours too.

383
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,200
Nice, hi there.

384
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,720
Julius is like very intensely looking at his phone,

385
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,680
like trying to figure stuff out before we leave.

386
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,220
I'm Stevie.

387
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,320
Take him back Sunday?

388
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,900
Okay.

389
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,180
Like Chick-fil-A?

390
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,160
Take him back Sunday. Julius looks back up at-

391
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,640
Like Chick-fil-A.

392
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,800
Julius looks back up at Stevie

393
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,320
having no idea what Chick-fil-A means.

394
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,240
Dude, taking him back Sunday like Chick-fil-A

395
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,380
would be a pretty good Christian Kanye lyric.

396
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,200
That would be really good on one of his Jesus songs.

397
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,720
Luke finally gets it.

398
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,200
Julius, absolutely not, looks back up and just says,

399
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,680
make damn sure.

400
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,880
Yeah, nice.

401
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,200
And he just goes back to texting on his phone.

402
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,200
Julius is preoccupied with his important work,

403
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,480
but I'm sure you'll gel quite well with the team.

404
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,280
We're happy to have you along today.

405
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,160
Thank you, Mr. Colorado, sir.

406
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,840
It's nice to meet a legend such as yourself.

407
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,520
Thank you.

408
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,500
Thank you, young person.

409
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,940
And to work underneath you and Mr. Wilder here,

410
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:53,360
who has, I mean, a long and storied history

411
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
as a grade-A cameraman.

412
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,400
Oh, dude, my reputation precedes me.

413
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,780
And I'm sure Mr. Summers here will prove himself worthy

414
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,800
of a producer title for the two of you.

415
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,680
Julius's ears perk up at that

416
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,360
and he puts his phone in his pocket.

417
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,480
He's like, yes.

418
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,320
Do you guys want any drinks before we get going?

419
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,400
Any caffeinated beverages?

420
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,020
Yeah, dude, I'll take one of my energy drink.

421
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,420
Totally.

422
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,040
I would love a Coca-Cola.

423
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,160
And for you, Mr. Summers?

424
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,600
Do you have black water?

425
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,360
Yeah, I'm sure I could find some.

426
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,960
If not, I'll take energy drink.

427
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,240
Okay, I'll meet you guys out of the van.

428
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,300
City energy drink.

429
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,620
The energy drink that just gets you by.

430
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,160
Just enough juice not to blow your brains out.

431
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,800
I'll meet you guys out of the van.

432
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,700
Yeah, I think we head down to the van,

433
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,840
but it's kind of eaten up at Beck

434
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,360
that he couldn't crack that phone.

435
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,880
He felt like this was an easy thing.

436
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,520
You find out who sent a pin.

437
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,320
That's like iPhone shit.

438
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,480
That's just basic shit.

439
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,160
Damn, that hurts.

440
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,040
As Julius gets down to the van,

441
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,040
he wants to drive, but he's gonna wait and see

442
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,660
if the intern is gonna try to drive or not.

443
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,400
Well, you guys, just the three of you out there.

444
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,240
Oh, just three of us?

445
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,640
Yeah, while she's grabbing your drinks.

446
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,940
Cal is looking over Beck's shoulder at the phone

447
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,120
and he points at the pin.

448
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,100
What's this pin?

449
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,880
Is that where the pin is?

450
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,400
Yeah, man, that's exactly right.

451
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,220
You nailed it.

452
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,160
That's where we're going.

453
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,340
Somebody told us that this is where we gotta go

454
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,640
and this is like a visual representation of that.

455
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,040
Because there's a pin there.

456
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,520
Yeah, you know when you're looking at a map on a wall

457
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,740
and you're saying, hey, I've been there before,

458
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,480
so you take a thumbtack and you put it in there?

459
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,680
Oh, yes, I see the pin on your phone.

460
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,520
It's like that.

461
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,440
That's where the pin is?

462
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,520
Beck, could I take a look?

463
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,360
Sure.

464
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,720
And he hands Julius the phone.

465
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,560
Somebody give me a ones dice, please.

466
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,320
A ones, just a ones?

467
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,680
Computer science, baby.

468
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,480
Julius hands the phone back to Beck.

469
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,360
I, yeah, don't know.

470
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,920
I said, oh shit, because he rolled a 65 also.

471
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,760
I don't know if that's.

472
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,920
Oh, I thought you said, oh shit, because he nailed it.

473
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,100
Even with luck, I wouldn't pass my roll.

474
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,200
Back to the conversation Beck and Colorado having.

475
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,160
I'm worried that you think that we're gonna go there

476
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,480
and find a physical pin there?

477
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,320
And that's not the case.

478
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,020
Yes, someone dropped a pin

479
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,320
and it's the key to unraveling the Gato Corporation.

480
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,520
Now I see what you were asking.

481
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,540
For sure, dude, no.

482
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,640
So there's not a physical pin when we get there.

483
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,800
This is just like the lingo we use today

484
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,840
to say like, go to a place.

485
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,120
You dropped a pen.

486
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,600
Yeah, yeah, kinda.

487
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,960
And this pin is where that pen is?

488
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,040
Yeah, but there's not a pin there.

489
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,640
Cal, there's a. There's a pen.

490
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,440
There's a pin.

491
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,720
Cal, there's a application on your phone

492
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,720
called either Google Maps or Apple Maps.

493
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,920
When you go to show somebody.

494
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,480
Yes, my daughter drops pins to me all the time.

495
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,480
That's the pin that we're talking about.

496
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,880
And this is a pin to the pen.

497
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
There's no pin.

498
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,720
Other than.

499
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,560
Let's not rule out the fact

500
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,680
that there could be a pin there, dude.

501
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,660
You guys turn back from this conversation

502
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,040
and Stevie Gotel is closing the door to the can van

503
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,400
after getting in the driver's seat and.

504
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,280
Stevie Gotel?

505
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,720
Did you mess that up?

506
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,120
Or is that just a slip of the tongue?

507
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,360
Oh, that's a slip of the tongue.

508
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,640
Stevie gets you out to the Gotel company.

509
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,180
This MPC seemed really cool,

510
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,920
but I didn't realize they were a fucking plant

511
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,200
for the Gotel board.

512
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,920
Can I go pee and then figure out

513
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,200
what I'm gonna do with a Gotel in our van?

514
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,320
Go for it.

515
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,480
I don't actually have to pee.

516
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,320
I'm just kidding.

517
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,160
We're gonna stick a pin in them.

518
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,600
My eyes got so big.

519
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,000
Sorry about that, Jesus.

520
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,960
Just yes and it.

521
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,120
Oh yes, she's a Gotel.

522
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,960
Cool.

523
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,740
Season two, almost over.

524
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,560
We have your grandchild.

525
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,980
We know about the pen.

526
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,920
No!

527
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,080
We have your grandchild.

528
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,760
We know about the pen.

529
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,680
Let's get going.

530
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,560
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

531
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,920
Honk, honk, beep, beep.

532
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,880
As you guys turn away from this conversation

533
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,560
that you're having, you notice that Stevie

534
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,600
has gotten into the driver's seat of the can van

535
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,040
and has slammed the door and started the can van.

536
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,060
And she rolls down the window and is like,

537
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,840
hey everybody, I've got your drinks ready in here for you.

538
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,200
Cal nods approvingly and then says to everybody else,

539
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
get in losers, we're making news.

540
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,040
All right, Cal.

541
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,280
Yeah, Julius hops in and he's scrolling through TikTok

542
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,800
to see like what kind of cool stuff

543
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,700
we can do for a TikTok this time.

544
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,160
Awesome, because I haven't talked to my uncle recently,

545
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,200
but I'm sure that that's what he wants.

546
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,440
I've pretended to many times.

547
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,820
For sake of you not screwing us over later,

548
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,880
the van is stocked with all my equipment already.

549
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,080
Oh Joe, you forgot to pack your camera.

550
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,060
Actually, yeah, sorry, you didn't roll to check

551
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,800
if the van had been robbed

552
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,900
while it was parked outside the studio.

553
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,600
Luke never said he actually got into the van.

554
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,600
So how are you guys doing with that Julius?

555
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,920
He's back at the station.

556
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,600
You were very good about like not jamming like that.

557
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,640
He's pretending to text his uncle.

558
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,640
That's just the thing, don't do that to your players.

559
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,040
If you're like a role player, like,

560
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,580
oh, you forgot to say Simon Says.

561
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,440
Yeah, don't play fucking Simon Says with your players.

562
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,200
That's a great rule of thumb for role playing.

563
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,200
Can I reiterate out of character real fast?

564
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,680
Isabelle Crane has, or.

565
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,520
Isabella Caya.

566
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,880
Isabella Caya has, can I reiterate real quick?

567
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,680
Isabella Caya has sent us to investigate

568
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,480
a secret company town, which is really fucking exciting

569
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,720
and weird and crazy.

570
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,560
Okay, cool.

571
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,880
Julius is stoked, but preoccupied with his uncle.

572
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,840
You're like looking at fucking TikTok.

573
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,940
Well, I'm like, why did I have to find this out

574
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,940
from Isabella Caya and not my uncle?

575
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,200
But then also looking up the songs we should use

576
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,440
in the background of our TikTok once we make.

577
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,640
Exactly, yeah, like trending hashtags today and.

578
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,460
Stevie notices that there are some very cool

579
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,100
driving gloves sitting up on the dash.

580
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,500
Oh, sorry, does someone else normally drive?

581
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,260
Julius kind of glances up and just goes,

582
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,420
put them on.

583
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,780
Oh, may I?

584
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,620
Put them on.

585
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,620
And she gets a plus 10 drive.

586
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,960
Oh, fuck yeah, she does.

587
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,420
And she rolled an aught too.

588
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,460
Yeah, tight.

589
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,020
Nice.

590
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,300
Okay, so you guys head outside of the city.

591
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,620
Immediately your can van jammed in this city traffic

592
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,340
just right off the bat and it takes a while

593
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,520
to get out into the interstate.

594
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,380
And Stevie's staying pretty quiet

595
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,000
until you get out on the highway.

596
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,340
But once you're out, she kind of looks

597
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,260
in the rear view mirror and she's like.

598
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,780
So do you guys, do you guys believe in ghosts?

599
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,960
Yeah, dude, yeah.

600
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,900
Oh, for real?

601
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,740
Yeah.

602
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,560
Have you seen one?

603
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,400
No.

604
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,240
Oh.

605
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,140
Some people at the station would tell you

606
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,400
you're looking at one.

607
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,200
Hi, kid.

608
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,720
I mean, I've seen things that they could be, dude.

609
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,240
What sort of ghosts are you talking about?

610
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,040
Oh, I just mean anything.

611
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,840
Do you guys think aliens are?

612
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,760
I'm just like, I just want to know

613
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,160
where your mind's at, you know?

614
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,800
You'd be like stupid not to believe in aliens.

615
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,500
Just probabilities or whatever, my dudes.

616
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,720
They gotta be out there.

617
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,640
I, you know, in college decided that they're out there.

618
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,640
Nice.

619
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,120
I want to believe.

620
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,460
Whoa, that's like Mulder, dude.

621
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,300
Who?

622
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,360
It's like a spooky dude who's like

623
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,720
into spooky stuff on a show.

624
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,640
You're like that dude.

625
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,000
Well, I am on a show.

626
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,960
Oh yeah, it's like double that way, yeah.

627
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,960
A pleasant conversation is always Beck.

628
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,240
The conversation continues and veers off

629
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,000
into different directions and then it kind of dies down

630
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,680
again and she gets that same sort of sound in her voice

631
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,680
and she's like, well, what do you guys think about like,

632
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,360
do you think it's possible to be like rich

633
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,000
and be a good person?

634
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,960
Like, do you think money corrupts absolutely?

635
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,540
Are you talking about Godel money or like?

636
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,380
Well, I mean.

637
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,920
More money than you make.

638
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,180
Well, certainly more money than I make,

639
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,020
but I mean, if we're heading out to talk about.

640
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,720
Well, we all certainly make a lot more money than you,

641
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,080
but does that make us bad people?

642
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,640
Well, I guess that's what I'm asking.

643
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,320
Do you think that making more money

644
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,880
has made you a worse person?

645
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,240
There was this one time where like I was like

646
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,600
putting on a coat for like the first time I had

647
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,240
like for all year and in that pocket there was 20 bucks

648
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,080
and I took that 20 bucks and I took Cal

649
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,880
and our old producer out to the foundry

650
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,920
and I got them all shots with it.

651
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,880
So I mean, I guess I'm kind of a case in point

652
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,440
that it doesn't have to corrupt absolutely.

653
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,780
I was rich and I helped my friends.

654
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,500
Wise words, Beckworth.

655
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,180
I like that.

656
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,780
Godel money though.

657
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,940
Yeah, what about like Godel money?

658
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,820
Godel money though.

659
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,180
Well, it's a good thing none of us

660
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,500
have to worry about that.

661
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:52,180
Yeah, for sure.

662
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,540
Humit?

663
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,900
Humit on Cal for having that much money?

664
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,580
No, I'm saying that as like I remember.

665
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,460
Oh, I thought it was Julius, I'm sorry.

666
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,100
Julius is related to the person that owns the news network.

667
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,460
And I got my job because they own the news network.

668
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,980
I don't think that's like Godel money though.

669
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,820
No, it's not.

670
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,740
That's like Monsanto money versus KY3 money.

671
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:25,740
Well, like better than KY3, but not like generational

672
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,480
billions.

673
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,300
No.

674
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,140
Exactly.

675
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,940
But Julius likes to think that it is.

676
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,980
I think you're gonna be just fine.

677
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,060
I'll be okay.

678
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,740
Just not enough to be a super villain.

679
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,640
How has it affected you?

680
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,500
I believe that I'm rich and you can tell from like

681
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,540
what I've said that.

682
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,340
We're all rich Luke in friendship.

683
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,940
You know that like Julius knows he's rich.

684
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,780
Okay.

685
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,740
But like he doesn't want you guys to know that,

686
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,820
but now you do.

687
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,700
Doesn't want us to know it or doesn't want us

688
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,580
to treat you differently because of it?

689
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,580
The first because of the second.

690
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,080
When you're about an hour outside the city,

691
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,040
you exit the interstate to a highway,

692
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,700
to a smaller highway, to a country road,

693
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,740
to another country road.

694
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:17,100
And the only signs around are for attractions behind you

695
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,860
with an easy place to turn around

696
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,260
within a minute of each sign.

697
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,780
And eventually the country road goes from asphalt

698
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,900
to gravel and a sign says road closed ahead,

699
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,960
please turn back.

700
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,620
Are we still on track to like where it's telling us to go?

701
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,920
Yeah, how far are we from the pen?

702
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,780
Stevie pulls up the navigation on her phone

703
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,500
and kind of holds it up near the rear view mirror

704
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,420
to show you guys.

705
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,500
And it's like, it says we're still going the right way.

706
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,620
Should I just keep going?

707
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,540
How far?

708
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,740
It looks like less than a mile.

709
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,740
Keep forward going.

710
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,980
Okay.

711
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,460
And she keeps driving and keeps going.

712
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,780
It twists, it turns, it's a gravel road.

713
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,960
The gravel road turns to dirt.

714
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,260
And at this point, there's just no signs anywhere.

715
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,340
There haven't been like streetlights

716
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,740
for miles at this point.

717
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:16,740
Here you see a sign that says stop dead end, no outlet.

718
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:21,180
I'm still going though.

719
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,140
There's another sign up there.

720
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,140
She points and as you guys approach that one,

721
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,420
it says danger road closed.

722
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,620
I think these signs are designed

723
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,380
merely to keep looky-loos out.

724
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,960
But we're the looky news.

725
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,360
She's like nervously laughing at that hilarious joke.

726
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,980
At this point, Beck is, like I said,

727
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,760
he's always taking B-roll out the windows and stuff.

728
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,720
But at this point, he's kind of crawled up to the front

729
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,580
between the passenger and the driver

730
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,180
and is filming out the front,

731
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,660
getting good shots of what we're seeing

732
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,500
as it's coming up on us.

733
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,780
Stevie, I think that you should just keep driving.

734
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:58,260
The road turns and suddenly you see that the road stops.

735
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:03,260
The dirt turns into a thick wall of brush.

736
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:08,400
So thick, so tall that you can't see through or over it.

737
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,680
And it goes left and right in all directions.

738
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,000
And it's actually so thick,

739
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,420
almost on either side of the road

740
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,220
that you wouldn't be able to walk too far into it

741
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:21,140
before you're waist high in verdant detritus.

742
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,860
Waist high, though?

743
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,420
Yeah, after a little bit, yeah.

744
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,340
It'd be about waist high.

745
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,180
So we can see over it?

746
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,060
Oh, no, no, no, sorry.

747
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,740
On the left and right, it's waist high.

748
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,420
Ahead of you, it's like three stories high

749
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,560
of just thicket and trees.

750
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,760
And there's kudzu laying over the top of these trees

751
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,260
so thick that you can't see through it.

752
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,560
Does it seem natural?

753
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,700
Does anyone have any sort of science role

754
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,380
or knowledge about plant life?

755
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,700
You can roll me an intelligence at a negative 40

756
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,940
if you'd like.

757
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,780
I'll try it.

758
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,600
I'll do that.

759
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,740
98.

760
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,180
It's a fail no matter what I get.

761
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,420
How many did you say minus?

762
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,300
40.

763
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,140
Yeah, that would put me at a 30 and I rolled a 34.

764
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,380
Oof. Very close.

765
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,520
Ouchie.

766
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,500
So you're not sure whether this plant life

767
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,100
naturally grows in this area,

768
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:17,300
but it's growing right next to all this other stuff.

769
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,880
It seems seamless as it grows into it all, so.

770
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,880
Do you guys know if we have a license to film in Egypt?

771
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,020
I get it, butt fucking Egypt, where we are.

772
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,620
I'm not sure that's the correct term,

773
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,740
but that was the joke.

774
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,980
What is the correct term?

775
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,380
Bum fuck Egypt.

776
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,860
No, it's butt fucking Egypt.

777
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,300
If we're talking out of character.

778
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,500
It's bum fuck Egypt.

779
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,860
If we're talking out of character.

780
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,700
I mean, hey, I looked at the tower,

781
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,500
you were totally right about that, but.

782
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,340
Oh.

783
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,940
Redemption.

784
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,380
BFE stands for either bum fuck or butt fuck Egypt.

785
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,220
So we're both right.

786
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,780
Somebody on a Reddit thread says bout fucking Egypt,

787
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,940
which is just dumb.

788
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,040
That's Reddit, baby.

789
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,340
It's gotta be about your butt, you know,

790
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,840
because that's what you fuck.

791
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,300
Does your butt hurt?

792
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,700
Do you want it to?

793
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,580
Julius makes that joke,

794
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,420
and then like whether or not Cal liked it,

795
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,780
he feels a deeper connection to Cal,

796
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:32,540
but also has no idea if these plants are real or not.

797
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,780
We've stopped the van at this point.

798
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,620
Yeah, it's.

799
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,660
Like the road has ended.

800
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:40,660
Yeah, but the pen shows on the other side of this like wall.

801
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,580
Beck wants to get out and take a camera

802
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,540
and go as close to the thicket as he can

803
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,280
and just kind of shove the lens in there

804
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,180
and do a big, as hard, as big a zoom as he can on this lens.

805
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,800
And just see if he sees,

806
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,040
if the lens penetrates better than his eyes can,

807
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,880
what's ahead.

808
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,660
Okay, go ahead and roll video.

809
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,700
Videographer.

810
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,060
While he rolls that,

811
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,500
can I roll to see if I can find like a,

812
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,860
something to cut through these vines?

813
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,300
Are you fucking kidding me, dude?

814
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,980
I have an 80 in this and I rolled a 90.

815
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,820
No.

816
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,660
God damn it.

817
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,920
So as you shove it into there,

818
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,780
you feel that it gets almost like trapped in a spot

819
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:26,340
where some sticks were facing out away from you.

820
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,980
You kind of pushed it in where it kind of latches back

821
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,660
onto them as you try to pull the camera back out,

822
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,240
but you're able to kind of wrestle it out

823
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,800
without damaging the camera at all.

824
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,360
And as you look at through the viewfinder

825
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,280
of what you just shot while it was

826
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,220
out of your view completely,

827
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:48,480
you see that it zooms into a leaf.

828
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,200
As this happens, Julius is like,

829
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,560
he's the new producer.

830
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:58,240
He wants to just like get to the story as fast as possible.

831
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,320
And thank you, I knocked my ones off earlier.

832
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,040
Will a two find me something to cut through this in the van?

833
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,000
Yeah, a two will.

834
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,440
So what is in the van that can cut through some thick brush?

835
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,560
With the two, there's a machete in there for some reason.

836
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,220
No, so the van used to have-

837
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,920
Giant scythes on the wheels there still.

838
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,000
The van used to have like little like curtains.

839
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,280
Forward, Stevie.

840
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,960
The van used to have curtains in the back

841
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,280
so that like people could edit in the back while they drove.

842
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,760
But now there's just no windows.

843
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,640
And for six months, Beck lived in there.

844
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,280
Laying down underneath one of the seats,

845
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,160
there's like the slider thing that the-

846
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,160
Curtain rod.

847
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,800
The curtain rod, yeah.

848
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,240
So I grabbed the curtain rod.

849
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,240
Yeah, so you grab the curtain rod

850
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,000
and you start swiping through.

851
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,280
And as you're doing that,

852
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,640
Stevie's kind of gotten out of the van as well

853
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,720
and is putting her hands in it

854
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,560
and just kind of like moving them around.

855
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,720
I don't know, maybe there's something here.

856
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,400
And then you guys hear a boom.

857
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,360
Julius, you feel like you've connected

858
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:15,480
with something thick and steel with this rod.

859
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,240
Like it feels like metal on metal.

860
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,080
Yeah.

861
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,920
Oh shit.

862
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,920
Yeah, we're talking certain parts

863
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,200
of the periodic table in your hands here.

864
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,600
Have I like, like before I hit the metal, did I cut-

865
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,440
The hard parts.

866
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,000
Before I hit the metal, did I like cut any like foliage?

867
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,520
Yeah, I mean, you can keep kind of pushing it away

868
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,760
from where you've dunked

869
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,000
and you can see that there's a bit of steel,

870
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
the plant life growing up on it and around it.

871
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,800
As soon as Beck heard the dunk,

872
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,920
he would have whipped around

873
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,880
and started filming what's going on there.

874
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,720
Yeah.

875
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,160
Yeah, Julius is just gonna use the curtain rod

876
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,600
to try to like scrape stuff off of the like metal

877
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,240
that he hit to like try to reveal whatever it is.

878
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:04,240
And as you do so, you notice that there seems to be

879
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,280
some paint on the steel.

880
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,880
As you push the thicket and brush

881
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,200
and all of this plant life out of the way

882
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:19,080
with your curtain rod,

883
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,440
you push enough away to show

884
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,960
where this paint on the steel is showing.

885
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,400
There's actually an arrow and you reveal an arrow

886
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,720
that's pointing to the left.

887
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,800
And as you push more away, there's above it,

888
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,360
it says door.

889
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,520
What color arrow?

890
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,480
You move some more, it's a yellow arrow.

891
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,040
I knew it was gonna be yellow.

892
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,320
Fuck, it's a green arrow.

893
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,560
Oh, okay.

894
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,720
Yeah, that makes sense if you're wanting to hide it.

895
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,240
And green is pretty industrial and like a...

896
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,680
Yeah, good choice.

897
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,200
And like a modern evil corporation

898
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,400
that wants to hide that it's an evil corporation.

899
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,240
That's right.

900
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,200
Yellow on like steel is just classic bad guy shit.

901
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,800
I look at Beck, obviously just like pointing

902
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,760
to like get some footage of what I've just revealed.

903
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,440
Beck sets up a nice shot that has it centered.

904
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,280
Perfect.

905
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,680
Yeah, I wanna just start clearing

906
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,160
whether it's like scraping or swiping

907
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,800
or whatever I need to do

908
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,400
to get to where that arrow is pointing.

909
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,400
And the sun is coming into full force.

910
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,560
It's about 1030 a.m. now on this July 5th.

911
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,200
But it's gonna be cloudy later in the day

912
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,360
so the sun right now, it's full.

913
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,720
It's doing everything it can

914
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,400
while it can.

915
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,680
Would you say it's around 96 degrees at this point in time?

916
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,680
Yeah, but it feels like 98 and sweat is picking up.

917
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,760
You are actively getting moist while doing this work.

918
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,840
And I'm like whacking, I'm like, I'm going all out

919
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,520
whacking with this curtain rod that is like so bent.

920
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:02,520
Like little pieces of it are like falling off

921
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,360
while I'm doing it.

922
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,200
You guys look back, you see Stevie is crushing

923
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,780
her second canned cold brew of the trip.

924
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,640
And she brings over one energy drink to Mr. Wilder

925
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,120
and brings another Coke over to Mr. Colorado.

926
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,280
She somehow kept it cold.

927
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,920
She's like, I brought a cooler.

928
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,480
Stevie, you are...

929
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,800
Thank you, oh, you said everything.

930
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,720
A newsman without words, oh wow, what a compliment.

931
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,680
Stevie, would you?

932
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,800
Am I a wonder?

933
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,500
Like an improv podcaster without words, it never happens.

934
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,520
Julius, yeah, asks Stevie, would you mind?

935
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,200
And hands her the curtain rod.

936
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,260
Yeah, for sure.

937
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,600
First of all, I mean, energy drink is funny

938
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,120
but like when we get Coke as a sponsor,

939
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,480
I'll be the one laughing.

940
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,360
You guys are gonna wish you said monster.

941
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,640
Call your shots.

942
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,600
We can't, we wouldn't get Red Bull.

943
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,120
So Stevie will take this crumpled.

944
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,720
In my mind, it's mostly crumpled

945
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,160
but there's like one foot of like solid curtain rod.

946
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,240
Yeah, and she's gonna use that to just basically

947
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,520
push up against the steel where you've left off

948
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,240
and then drag it forcefully to the left

949
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,420
is just kind of heading toward this arrow.

950
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,880
You guys have made it probably eight feet of clearing

951
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,080
by this point and it's taken like 15 minutes.

952
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,040
Can I do like a search roll through this foliage

953
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,680
to see if I can find more of an easy point of access?

954
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,160
Yeah, absolutely, go ahead and roll.

955
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,840
Wait, okay, yeah, I was afraid of that.

956
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,560
That's a 66 on a 60, that's a critical failure.

957
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,620
You went to the right.

958
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,100
Well, I like, I trip into some of the foliage

959
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,240
like trying to point out something

960
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,400
and a bunch of our progress is eliminated, I think,

961
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,560
like 15 more minutes of hacking

962
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,040
because I brought down a bunch of vines and shit.

963
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,760
And Cal, as you trip.

964
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,480
I think I see something, fellas.

965
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,880
You trip and knock over a bunch of vines

966
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,640
which at first everyone thinks

967
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,340
is going to cause a deep impediment

968
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:25,340
but it actually reveals a thick metal hatch door.

969
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,920
And as you begin to pick yourself up off the ground,

970
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,920
you look down and see that you have fallen into poison oak.

971
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,400
Oh.

972
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,000
I was wondering, I was like,

973
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,800
we can't go through the door, it came from a crisp hill.

974
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,680
I was like, what the fuck?

975
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,920
We're not gonna go that way.

976
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,780
It seems like you really screwed up

977
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,240
and that's the bad thing that happened.

978
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,560
Cal, cover that up slowly.

979
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,920
We never saw the hatch.

980
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,340
Cal's like, no, my news hands.

981
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,160
So until you get this cleared up,

982
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,160
you're gonna be at a negative 20%

983
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,600
because you're gonna be dealing with how itchy you are.

984
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,440
To everything?

985
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,360
Yeah. Okay.

986
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,080
Stevie, Stevie, do you have any salve?

987
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,040
Actually, you know what?

988
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,880
It's gonna give you a plus,

989
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,660
it's gonna take away 20 on everything

990
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:16,140
but it's gonna give you a plus 20 on grip

991
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:19,660
because you're way more focused on your own body

992
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,900
than the world around you.

993
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,000
That's really cool.

994
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,100
I thought you meant grip.

995
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,460
Like, I was like, Zach, think about that.

996
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,780
Plus 20 to climb.

997
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,380
That's because your hands are so sticky

998
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,620
from them being just blisters.

999
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:38,020
My Cal ooze lets me cling to walls.

1000
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,340
No, I actually really like that.

1001
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,380
Like physical pain keeps you distracted from-

1002
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:44,800
From your mental pain?

1003
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,640
Yeah.

1004
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,480
Flagellation, baby.

1005
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,300
So plus 20 grip, minus 20 everything else?

1006
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,120
Yep.

1007
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,020
Whoa, Cal, you did it, man.

1008
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,680
That's the door.

1009
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,820
I suppose I did.

1010
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,820
Let's see if there's a pin behind there.

1011
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,140
No, no, Cal.

1012
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:04,960
Yeah, all right.

1013
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,000
Yeah, let's see if there's a pin.

1014
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,460
I need you guys to stand back for a little bit.

1015
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:14,500
Obviously, we need you to record the whole thing

1016
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,500
and you're the face.

1017
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,540
And I try to open the hatch up.

1018
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,860
As you turn the wheel of this enormous metal hatch

1019
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,500
into open, unlocked position

1020
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,740
and with almost a free momentum

1021
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,580
without giving any weight push at all.

1022
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:40,340
As if it was like a hydraulic system to open up.

1023
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,260
This door just, I'm gonna do it again.

1024
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:47,060
Wait, is it going like this or like this?

1025
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,900
Like a normal door, like a normal door.

1026
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,740
I thought you said it was a hatch.

1027
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,140
Yeah, I was picturing it on the ground too.

1028
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:57,140
You said he fell onto, like a metal door.

1029
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:01,260
I only use the word hatch and I keep doing this to you guys.

1030
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,720
But when I say hatch, I just mean one of those

1031
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,120
like a thick metal doors like in a submarine.

1032
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,060
Yeah, like a SpongeBob door.

1033
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,740
But not necessarily round.

1034
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,580
Exactly.

1035
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,420
Gotcha.

1036
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,460
Yeah, this is magic.

1037
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:15,880
Okay, cool, I gotcha, perfectly.

1038
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,340
Like 007.

1039
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,580
A door that you open with a cool spinny thing.

1040
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,420
Yeah, the cool spinny thing does that noise.

1041
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,980
Those can be round, but this one is not.

1042
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,380
Just to make sure.

1043
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:29,420
This is vertical door leading into the structure

1044
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:32,620
that we were previously hacking at, right?

1045
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:36,020
Yep, and it's the one that the arrow was pointing at.

1046
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:36,860
That too.

1047
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,980
Cool.

1048
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,420
I go in if it opens.

1049
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,460
Beck wants to turn on the light of his camera.

1050
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:46,420
It is not dark on the other side.

1051
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,780
In fact, it's quite bright.

1052
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,420
And as the three of you walk through,

1053
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,940
Stevie right behind you on your tail,

1054
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:55,780
carrying all of your gear.

1055
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,100
Beck has a tail, by the way.

1056
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,460
Heh heh heh heh heh heh.

1057
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,460
Riding Beck's tail.

1058
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,540
Stan Stevie is three inches tall.

1059
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,540
Listening to Julius' tail.

1060
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:07,500
Heh heh heh heh heh heh.

1061
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:11,860
On the other side of this enormous and lush impediment

1062
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:16,460
is a vast opening with plenty to unpack.

1063
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,140
He said vast opening with plenty to unpack.

1064
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:23,780
First, you see an unnecessarily massive bridge,

1065
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:27,780
20 meters tall and 100 meters long.

1066
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,860
This bridge is a minimalist construction

1067
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:34,700
showcasing the steel that seems to be the only way

1068
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:39,700
over this deep, wide and foggy ravine.

1069
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,820
On your side of this bridge,

1070
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:48,380
a single simple steel train car is waiting

1071
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:53,100
in a simple steel single train car sized train station,

1072
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:58,100
presumably here to take you across this awe inducing chasm.

1073
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:01,660
On the outside of this minimalist depot,

1074
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:06,060
above a wall of lockers is a sign that says,

1075
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:09,300
Welcome to Grover's Gorge,

1076
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:14,220
founded by Frank Godel in 1945

1077
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,780
by necessity, not choice.

1078
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:20,620
My life is great

1079
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:24,780
And it's all my fault

1080
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:29,780
Cause my life is great

1081
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,780
And it's all mine

1082
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:44,140
Cause my life is great

1083
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:47,180
And it's all my fault
