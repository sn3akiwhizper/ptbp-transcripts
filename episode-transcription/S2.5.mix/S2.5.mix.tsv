0	2160	Hello, my little listeners.
2160	5160	It's your big beefy brisket wolf, the dog.
5160	8280	And I'm here to sizzle myself up and feed myself
8280	11120	to all of my hungry little babies.
11120	13640	Make sure and take a Pepto, baby,
13640	16240	because I don't go down smooth.
16240	21800	I am digesting it, y'all, live from 694.2 PTBP,
21800	24920	the best radio show that also operates
24920	27640	as a pop-up barbecue restaurant.
27680	30680	While we digest and digress,
30680	33120	why not see what the adoring public
33120	35400	is saying about us, shall we?
35400	37360	I hope I impress.
37360	41320	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from KDB in West Virginia,
41320	44680	who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Park.
44680	48800	A quick and easy way to make wolf feel loved and supported.
48800	52960	KDB writes, hello, coming at you from the land
52960	56760	of the cryptids, almost heaven, West Virginia.
56840	60160	I've been listening since early season one,
60160	62480	and I'm loving all the eldritch horror
62480	64240	y'all bring into my day.
64240	67440	Thanks for your absolutely inspired characters,
67440	71760	stories, editing, and for spicing up my music taste.
71760	73880	Shout out to my friend, Sid,
73880	76360	who I will eventually convince to listen
76360	78840	to this podcast alongside me.
78840	80880	And stay safe out there, wolf.
80880	83680	We can't have the horrors that be stopping you
83680	86040	from your wonderful hosting.
86120	90240	Horrors that be stopping me?
90240	93680	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
93680	97960	If there's one thing you should know, KDB in West Virginia,
97960	102400	it's that the horrors that be should be terrified of me.
102400	106520	There is no horror that I cannot simply consume.
106520	110880	Any deranged beings out there that don't fear respect me
110880	115520	simply haven't witnessed my capacity.
115520	116760	If you want to write up something
116760	119160	for your big beefy wolf to how,
119160	123760	make a notification pop up on one of my many devices.
123760	125320	How, you may ask?
125320	128440	Just play some golf inside the libretto.
128440	132600	That's right, the links are in the show notes.
132600	135680	Oh, and I'm getting word here that my producer wants to add
135680	139560	that also in those sweet delicious network revisions
139560	144560	wrapped sausages are portals to our Patreon and merch shop.
144560	146200	Let's make a deal.
146200	149080	You slip me some greasy dollars
149080	151600	and I'll keep reading the news.
151600	155320	Last time, Julius blacked out at the foundry
155320	157440	after his liquid inauguration
157440	160680	into the 24 hour city news family.
160680	163160	But Beck and Cal actually remembered
163160	166000	the evening's post printing press.
166000	169480	Beck was heckled by his disappointed mother Kim
169480	171920	and Cal had an endearing heart to heart
171960	174760	with his daughter Carol, which is great.
174760	179000	I'll bet his story continues to be wholesome and delightful
179000	183480	and definitely will not devolve into unadulterated madness.
183480	186440	Probably, but keep your chin up.
186440	188440	I've got a fresh little ditty here
188440	191120	for our fifth episode of season two.
191120	195520	Prepare yourself for a brand new theme song.
195520	200520	It's altar girl with my life is great and it's all my fault.
202000	204000	And it's all my fault
206200	208200	Cause my life is great
211160	213160	And it's all mine
220640	222640	Cause my life is great
225480	227480	And it's all my fault
231920	236920	Dude, I just remember this, but last night
243360	244960	I woke up in the middle of the night
244960	248960	cause I like thought I was choking.
248960	250760	Well, it was like, I was having a dream
250760	252360	where I thought I was choking.
252360	255080	Then I woke up, do what?
256320	257240	On D's nest.
257240	261440	No, I woke up and both sides of my nose were bleeding
261960	264200	and I was just like breathing it in.
264200	266720	And then this morning when I took a shower,
266720	269000	I was like, Oh, I got to blow my nose.
269000	271840	And I blew out a chunk of like dried blood
271840	273640	that was like this fucking long.
275400	277360	It was rad and disgusting.
279440	282200	My dad gets them all the time from doing cocaine
282200	283680	and I get them all the time
283680	286680	cause my dad made me do cocaine when I was a little kid.
286680	287800	It's cool. Your dad sounds cool.
287800	288920	Well, it is cool.
288920	290200	Cause you're like, yeah, I know somebody
290200	291680	can get you cocaine.
291680	293960	My dad, my cool dad.
293960	295400	This is my mom and my plug.
298520	300120	In that order, I love my mom.
302120	304840	Fade up on Tuesday, July 5th.
304840	308080	It's the Tuesday morning meeting here at Cannes.
308080	309320	And as you're looking around the room,
309320	312800	you notice that the producer of city action news,
312800	315360	Ty for Rayland is nowhere to be found.
315360	318120	He's normally at the big chair
318120	321400	at the head of the table here at this long table
321400	323520	in this beautiful conference room.
324840	329600	Isabella Kaya, the head anchor city action news,
329600	332760	who was once co-anchor with Cal Colorado,
332760	337400	but now is the sole lead of city action news.
337400	340400	She walks forward to the front of the room
340400	343840	and stands at the head of the table.
343840	345240	Hello everyone.
345240	347760	Thank you all so much for being here today.
347760	350680	As you may have heard, Ty for Rayland,
350680	354880	our beautiful boss is out having a meeting
354880	358360	at the city tower with the who's who and whatnot.
358360	361760	So I'll be handing out assignments today.
361760	363640	Quick question, just as a newsman.
363640	365120	Cal raises his hand.
365120	367720	Who is who and what is what not?
367720	372720	She giggles to herself and gives a massive eye roll
373200	377480	to the sports person and the news person who work here.
378080	380760	And their names both start with S and their names are?
380760	383160	Howard Chesh is the weatherman.
383160	384280	Shay Star.
384280	386640	And Shay Star, nice, well done.
386640	388480	I knew Shay Star, that's two S's.
388480	391400	It's two S's, Shay Star, well done.
391400	394160	You said the meeting was at city tower, you called it?
394160	395200	Yeah, the city tower.
395200	397600	And it's shaped like the Teen Titans building.
399920	400760	I'm here for that.
400760	401600	You like that?
401600	402440	Yeah, I like that.
402440	407000	That's a little local reference for Springfield listeners.
407600	408440	All four of us.
408440	410840	Springfield is the headquarters of the Teen Titans.
410840	414160	Dude, the Hammond's tower is the Teen Titans building.
414160	417480	Yeah, but I was picturing the Teen Titans tower.
417480	419240	Which is one in the same.
419240	420400	Okay, no, it's not.
421520	423400	It's similar looking.
423400	426520	The Teen Titans is a giant T.
426520	430600	And the Hammond's tower has giant T's
430600	432320	on the side of all four sides.
432320	433480	No, it has like.
433480	435320	Anyway, Julius says.
435440	437400	Slightly larger section at the top.
437400	438960	It's like a big blob at the top.
438960	441400	The T on top of the Teen Titans tower
441400	444040	is literally as long as the building itself.
444040	446040	I'm not saying that Hammond's tower
446040	449160	looks exactly the same as Teen Titans tower,
449160	452440	but I'm saying if Hammond's tower looks like anything,
452440	454240	it looks like the Teen Titans tower.
454240	455760	Luke, I got your back on that.
455760	459760	That looks like a caricature of Hammond's tower.
459760	461760	Joe, you're right, that looks exactly
461760	463480	like the Teen Titans tower.
463520	464360	You're right.
466200	467320	Motherfuckers.
468920	472000	The Hammond's tower is literally a giant T, bro.
472000	475360	No, man, it's like an I with no bottom piece.
475360	478600	It's like an I with no bottom piece, so like a T?
478600	482360	No, man, how do you draw your I's?
482360	484380	Like a T with a bottom T.
485800	488440	Hey, guys, Google the Hammond's tower
488440	491840	in Springfield, Missouri and tell me I'm not fucking wrong.
491840	495480	Tell me, Google it, tweet at Luke Ginniman in 69.
495480	499440	I know right I am, at indoor two underscores living.
499440	501520	The Hammond's tower would be,
501520	503000	the Hammond's tower looks like a T
503000	506560	if you like chopped its arms off at the shoulder.
506560	509200	I mean, look at this picture, it's a T.
509200	511240	If you ignore most of the building.
511240	513560	Okay, this is a stupid discussion.
513560	515040	No, this is what the people wanna hear.
515040	516840	They wanna hear about happiness.
516840	518480	Yeah, look at that, right?
518480	519960	I think that you would be hard pressed
519960	521640	to find anybody who wouldn't go, huh,
522480	523300	when you saw that.
523300	524280	Huh, looks a lot like the teen Titan building.
524280	527840	Joe has shown us a reasonably damning comparison.
527840	532840	You guys just don't wanna believe the things I say
533480	535440	cause guess what, I speak the truth.
537840	540680	So he's busy at a meeting at the city tower,
540680	542720	but you guys are here in the conference room
542720	545000	at City Action News Studios,
545000	547960	where Isabel Acaya is handing out the assignments.
548000	552920	Okay, Cal, I actually got you something pretty great.
552920	554400	It's an exclusive.
554400	555480	Yeah, you with me?
555480	556320	Asclusi.
556320	560080	Yeah, oh, I love it when you use my language.
560080	562200	Yes, you got Asclusi.
562200	563080	Under his breath, he's like,
563080	564660	I taught you to say Sclusi.
566920	569880	Cal stabs his leg with his pin under the table.
572560	575140	This Sclusi is just for you, Cal,
575140	576520	and your whole team here.
576560	578480	Just so you guys know,
578480	581280	I'm texting my uncle to see what's up.
581280	583840	He makes sure to interrupt her on that.
583840	585100	Okay, are you done?
585100	588080	Julius, it's not polite to interrupt, especially women.
588080	590060	I act like I didn't say anything.
592000	593680	Okay, weird.
594560	599000	Okay, so yeah, it's Asclusi with the Gato company.
599000	600840	It's Asclusi on the Gato company.
600840	603960	Apparently they have this secret company town
603960	607400	and someone out there is gonna show you around apparently.
607400	609960	I don't know, Fred Gottel,
609960	611480	and kind of the whole crowd is like,
611480	614320	holy crap, won't be there.
614320	615440	And everyone's like, ugh.
616640	621080	As you know, he likes to be on camera as little as possible
621080	623520	when he's not fully in control of the narrative,
623520	626400	you know, as those big boys like to do.
626400	630400	So there's actually just a dropped pin for the address.
630400	631800	Not sure what that's about.
631800	634640	Actually, this might just be like a wild goose chase,
634640	635480	who knows?
635480	637580	Like who dropped the pin, though?
637580	641040	Can't reveal the source at this time, I'm being told.
641040	642360	I mean, I could take a look at that
642360	645400	and I might be able to find a trace
645400	648020	of who maybe dropped the pin or whatever.
648020	649680	Oh, okay, yeah, cool.
649680	653000	On your way out, just see who was the PA,
653000	655080	who was the intern who was running for you guys.
655080	656680	Oh, that's a fantastic question.
656680	659960	He can't look Julius in the eye right now
660000	662000	because of what happened during the printing press.
662000	663120	Ha ha ha!
663120	664680	He ripped my fucking...
664680	666240	Yeah, it's the one who ripped your shirt off
666240	667800	because he was like fucking plastic.
667800	670920	During the rip, I can't wear that suit anymore.
670920	671760	During the rip.
671760	673200	I don't remember a lot from that night,
673200	676120	but I do remember who did that to me.
676120	679140	Somebody get the intern, what's his name?
679140	681680	And literally no one in the room can remember his name.
681680	685120	And this like very haphazard looking,
685120	687400	bug-eyed boy comes running in.
687440	690840	He's like, yeah, sorry, what did you guys want?
690840	695040	You got the phone where we got the tip with the dropped pin?
695040	696000	He's like, oh yeah.
696000	699200	And he brings you a, who would it be from?
699200	700200	Who would get the tip?
700200	702080	Like who would have this dropped pin?
702080	706560	There's just like the constant emails that come in
706560	709000	and they scour through like what is the intern.
709000	709840	The email goblin.
709840	711800	All of the messages incoming from social media
711800	712760	and stuff come to my phone.
712760	714580	So yeah, it's this.
714580	715680	And he hands you his phone
715680	717760	and immediately disappears out of the room.
717760	721200	Okay, yeah, so that's all I need from you guys
721200	722300	if you wanna head out.
722300	726680	That's, I think I read it was 83.6 miles away.
726680	728000	So you're gonna wanna get out.
728000	729700	That way you can get back in time.
729700	730880	Cal is kind of confused.
730880	734160	He's like, so we'll find the pin out there
734160	736140	that someone dropped?
736140	738920	Yeah, and she like smiles at the rest of the room.
738920	741400	Julius gets up from his seat and looks at her
741400	746400	and it's like, oh yeah, by the way, my uncle says hi.
747640	750220	And he at no point has texted his uncle.
752720	755200	She just kind of blinks at you for a second.
755200	756280	Who are you?
757200	761360	Julius makes a mental note and goes to walk near Cal.
761360	763640	Oh, you're producing for Mr. Cal.
763640	765120	Mr. Cal, have a good time.
765120	767020	Bye.
767020	768160	Thank you, Isabella.
768160	769180	I certainly will.
769180	771940	Can I catch the intern that's walking away?
771940	772780	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
772780	775140	As you guys head out out of the conference room
775140	777220	and heading out towards the front door,
777220	779940	you see him, he's pacing back and forth somewhere.
779940	781460	He's just like talking to himself.
781460	782940	I just kind of do a quick run up to him.
782940	785340	Hey man, can I like check out the email that you got
785340	786380	that had this pin in it?
786380	787340	Yeah, absolutely.
787340	790140	And he takes the phone from you and scrolls through it
790140	792100	and clicks on it and hands it back to you.
792100	794860	Perfect, then I'm gonna start searching this phone
794860	796700	with either CompSci or Cygant.
796700	798980	Oh yeah, go CompSci on it.
799620	800460	Go computer science, please.
800460	803220	I'm trying to find, go fucking CompSci on that phone.
803220	805820	I'm doing like hackery stuff to find IP addresses
805820	807420	and all sorts of things.
807420	810420	In the meantime, I do want to text my uncle
810420	811700	and like see what's up.
811700	814180	Luke, you can text your uncle.
814180	815300	That was always allowed.
815300	816740	I know, that's why I just did it.
816740	818260	Oh, he's doing it in game now though.
818260	819900	Oh, oh.
819900	822340	Could you text your actual uncle and tell him I say hi?
822340	823620	Which one?
823620	824460	Either.
824460	827680	Dave or, I'm not gonna text Dave, fuck Dave.
827680	828520	No, text Dave.
829000	829840	I'll text Donny.
829840	830680	Donny's a cool one.
832080	834080	Luke gave the shocker when he said that.
835840	836680	Joe, what'd you roll?
836680	838560	There's a 65 on a 60.
838560	841240	Oh, do you want to spend luck?
841240	842140	I ain't got it.
842140	845280	Oh, shit.
845280	850040	Okay, for some reason it's coming from a blocked IP.
850040	851880	It seems that it was run through.
851880	856880	You can tell it's actually a specific IP that VPNs use
857040	858920	and you recognize it as being like,
858920	860840	oh, they blocked where they came from.
860840	863720	Ah, dang, this guy's a little bit tricky, guys.
863720	866220	We might want to have our wits about us.
866220	869040	I don't know if this is like above board or whatever
869040	871000	because they're like hiding their tracks.
871000	872000	He's a little bit tricky,
872000	873760	but I'm a little bit rock and roll.
873760	874920	I think we can do it.
874920	878640	I've actually just texted my uncle
878640	882240	to see if he has any information about this story.
882240	883240	I mean, at the end of the day,
883240	885480	it's like a follow-up to the story we did in the corn
885480	886760	in the crab farm, right?
887520	889520	Cal like gives you a pained expression for a second
889520	890840	thinking about that day.
890840	892720	I suppose so.
892720	894860	I was also speaking in jest earlier.
894860	896140	I prefer jazz.
897440	898280	Oh, I know.
898280	899440	I knew it was a joke, dude.
899440	900440	It was a good one, man.
900440	902680	Oh, thank you.
902680	903720	Anchor good?
903720	905640	Oh, dude, of course, anchor good.
905640	906760	Thank you, Beck.
906760	909680	Either way, we should definitely get out there.
909680	913720	The door of the conference room swings open wide real quick
913720	915560	and Isabelle Lacaya is standing there
915600	917840	and she's like, oh yeah, shit, one more thing,
917840	920120	completely forgot, slipped my mind.
920120	922320	We figured you might need another pair of hands
922320	924440	since this seems like whatever.
924440	926400	You don't know what it is.
926400	928280	So we figured since you're out for the day,
928280	931160	we'll send a PA with you.
931160	933440	She said her name was Stevie
933440	936200	and then Isabelle Lacaya disappears
936200	937580	back into the conference room.
937580	940480	And you see Stevie is a scrawny little dude
940480	942640	wearing cigarette-legged jeans
942640	944800	in an oversized black hoodie.
944880	948640	She has earbuds plugged into her ear holes
948640	951720	and a thick wall of dark wavy hair
951720	954720	covering their eyes, nose, and top lip
954720	959540	only revealing a black lipstick-covered bottom lip
959540	961480	pierced with a small hoop.
961480	963880	And you say they don't have ears, just holes?
965720	968520	Well, the earbuds themselves are plugged into the holes.
968520	971100	There are the flappy parts around.
971100	971940	Hi.
973740	977580	Hello, Stevie, your ears are normally flappy.
977580	978940	I'm Cal Colorado.
978940	981620	Hi, Mr. Colorado, it's nice to meet you.
981620	983860	I'm Stevie, can I get you anything?
983860	986100	Hi, Stevie, it's nice to meet you guys.
986100	987260	What's your name?
987260	989080	Is this the first time that Beck would've met this person?
989080	990360	Because it sounds like somebody
990360	992060	who Beck would be friends with, for sure.
992060	994380	Yeah, this is a new, you've known it.
994380	996060	Hey, Stevie, what's going on?
996060	996900	Good to meet you.
996900	998500	Hi, yeah, it's nice to meet you too.
998500	1000840	I like your vibe.
1001440	1002360	I'm digging yours too.
1002360	1004200	Nice, hi there.
1004200	1007720	Julius is like very intensely looking at his phone,
1007720	1010680	like trying to figure stuff out before we leave.
1010680	1012220	I'm Stevie.
1012220	1013320	Take him back Sunday?
1015060	1015900	Okay.
1015900	1017180	Like Chick-fil-A?
1018220	1020160	Take him back Sunday. Julius looks back up at-
1020160	1021640	Like Chick-fil-A.
1021640	1023800	Julius looks back up at Stevie
1023800	1027320	having no idea what Chick-fil-A means.
1027320	1029240	Dude, taking him back Sunday like Chick-fil-A
1029240	1032380	would be a pretty good Christian Kanye lyric.
1033880	1036200	That would be really good on one of his Jesus songs.
1036200	1037720	Luke finally gets it.
1039920	1044200	Julius, absolutely not, looks back up and just says,
1044200	1045680	make damn sure.
1045680	1046880	Yeah, nice.
1046880	1050200	And he just goes back to texting on his phone.
1050200	1054200	Julius is preoccupied with his important work,
1054200	1056480	but I'm sure you'll gel quite well with the team.
1056480	1058280	We're happy to have you along today.
1058520	1060160	Thank you, Mr. Colorado, sir.
1060160	1062840	It's nice to meet a legend such as yourself.
1063680	1064520	Thank you.
1064520	1065500	Thank you, young person.
1065500	1068940	And to work underneath you and Mr. Wilder here,
1068940	1073360	who has, I mean, a long and storied history
1073360	1075360	as a grade-A cameraman.
1075360	1078400	Oh, dude, my reputation precedes me.
1078400	1082780	And I'm sure Mr. Summers here will prove himself worthy
1082780	1085800	of a producer title for the two of you.
1085800	1088680	Julius's ears perk up at that
1088680	1090360	and he puts his phone in his pocket.
1090360	1091480	He's like, yes.
1091480	1094320	Do you guys want any drinks before we get going?
1094320	1096400	Any caffeinated beverages?
1096400	1100020	Yeah, dude, I'll take one of my energy drink.
1100020	1101420	Totally.
1101420	1103040	I would love a Coca-Cola.
1103040	1105160	And for you, Mr. Summers?
1105160	1107600	Do you have black water?
1107600	1109360	Yeah, I'm sure I could find some.
1109360	1111960	If not, I'll take energy drink.
1111960	1116240	Okay, I'll meet you guys out of the van.
1116240	1118300	City energy drink.
1118300	1120620	The energy drink that just gets you by.
1123240	1126160	Just enough juice not to blow your brains out.
1126160	1127800	I'll meet you guys out of the van.
1127800	1129700	Yeah, I think we head down to the van,
1129700	1131840	but it's kind of eaten up at Beck
1131840	1133360	that he couldn't crack that phone.
1133360	1134880	He felt like this was an easy thing.
1134880	1136520	You find out who sent a pin.
1136520	1138320	That's like iPhone shit.
1138320	1140480	That's just basic shit.
1140520	1142160	Damn, that hurts.
1142160	1144040	As Julius gets down to the van,
1144040	1147040	he wants to drive, but he's gonna wait and see
1147040	1149660	if the intern is gonna try to drive or not.
1149660	1151400	Well, you guys, just the three of you out there.
1151400	1152240	Oh, just three of us?
1152240	1153640	Yeah, while she's grabbing your drinks.
1153640	1156940	Cal is looking over Beck's shoulder at the phone
1156940	1159120	and he points at the pin.
1159120	1160100	What's this pin?
1160100	1161880	Is that where the pin is?
1161880	1163400	Yeah, man, that's exactly right.
1163400	1164220	You nailed it.
1164220	1165160	That's where we're going.
1165160	1167340	Somebody told us that this is where we gotta go
1167340	1169640	and this is like a visual representation of that.
1169680	1171040	Because there's a pin there.
1171040	1175520	Yeah, you know when you're looking at a map on a wall
1175520	1177740	and you're saying, hey, I've been there before,
1177740	1179480	so you take a thumbtack and you put it in there?
1179480	1181680	Oh, yes, I see the pin on your phone.
1181680	1182520	It's like that.
1182520	1183440	That's where the pin is?
1183440	1185520	Beck, could I take a look?
1185520	1186360	Sure.
1186360	1188720	And he hands Julius the phone.
1188720	1191560	Somebody give me a ones dice, please.
1191560	1193320	A ones, just a ones?
1193320	1194680	Computer science, baby.
1194680	1199480	Julius hands the phone back to Beck.
1199480	1202360	I, yeah, don't know.
1203840	1205920	I said, oh shit, because he rolled a 65 also.
1205920	1206760	I don't know if that's.
1206760	1208920	Oh, I thought you said, oh shit, because he nailed it.
1208920	1211100	Even with luck, I wouldn't pass my roll.
1212160	1214200	Back to the conversation Beck and Colorado having.
1214200	1216160	I'm worried that you think that we're gonna go there
1216160	1218480	and find a physical pin there?
1218480	1219320	And that's not the case.
1219320	1221020	Yes, someone dropped a pin
1221020	1223320	and it's the key to unraveling the Gato Corporation.
1223320	1224520	Now I see what you were asking.
1224520	1225540	For sure, dude, no.
1225540	1228640	So there's not a physical pin when we get there.
1228640	1230800	This is just like the lingo we use today
1230800	1232840	to say like, go to a place.
1232840	1234120	You dropped a pen.
1234120	1235600	Yeah, yeah, kinda.
1235600	1237960	And this pin is where that pen is?
1237960	1240040	Yeah, but there's not a pin there.
1240040	1241640	Cal, there's a. There's a pen.
1241640	1243440	There's a pin.
1243440	1246720	Cal, there's a application on your phone
1246720	1250720	called either Google Maps or Apple Maps.
1254080	1257920	When you go to show somebody.
1258040	1260480	Yes, my daughter drops pins to me all the time.
1260480	1265480	That's the pin that we're talking about.
1267200	1268880	And this is a pin to the pen.
1268880	1269880	There's no pin.
1270880	1271720	Other than.
1271720	1272560	Let's not rule out the fact
1272560	1274680	that there could be a pin there, dude.
1274680	1276660	You guys turn back from this conversation
1276660	1281040	and Stevie Gotel is closing the door to the can van
1281040	1283400	after getting in the driver's seat and.
1283400	1284280	Stevie Gotel?
1284280	1285720	Did you mess that up?
1285720	1287120	Or is that just a slip of the tongue?
1287240	1289360	Oh, that's a slip of the tongue.
1289360	1292640	Stevie gets you out to the Gotel company.
1292640	1295180	This MPC seemed really cool,
1295180	1297920	but I didn't realize they were a fucking plant
1297920	1299200	for the Gotel board.
1299200	1301920	Can I go pee and then figure out
1301920	1305200	what I'm gonna do with a Gotel in our van?
1305200	1306320	Go for it.
1306320	1307480	I don't actually have to pee.
1307480	1308320	I'm just kidding.
1308320	1309160	We're gonna stick a pin in them.
1309160	1310600	My eyes got so big.
1311520	1313000	Sorry about that, Jesus.
1314880	1315960	Just yes and it.
1315960	1318120	Oh yes, she's a Gotel.
1318120	1318960	Cool.
1319800	1321740	Season two, almost over.
1323480	1325560	We have your grandchild.
1328420	1329980	We know about the pen.
1332080	1332920	No!
1338080	1340080	We have your grandchild.
1340080	1341760	We know about the pen.
1341760	1342680	Let's get going.
1343680	1345560	Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
1345560	1346920	Honk, honk, beep, beep.
1346920	1348880	As you guys turn away from this conversation
1348880	1351560	that you're having, you notice that Stevie
1351560	1354600	has gotten into the driver's seat of the can van
1354600	1359040	and has slammed the door and started the can van.
1359040	1362060	And she rolls down the window and is like,
1362060	1365840	hey everybody, I've got your drinks ready in here for you.
1365840	1369200	Cal nods approvingly and then says to everybody else,
1369200	1371200	get in losers, we're making news.
1373640	1375040	All right, Cal.
1376200	1379280	Yeah, Julius hops in and he's scrolling through TikTok
1379280	1380800	to see like what kind of cool stuff
1380800	1382700	we can do for a TikTok this time.
1384460	1387160	Awesome, because I haven't talked to my uncle recently,
1387160	1389200	but I'm sure that that's what he wants.
1390960	1393440	I've pretended to many times.
1393440	1395820	For sake of you not screwing us over later,
1395820	1398880	the van is stocked with all my equipment already.
1398880	1401080	Oh Joe, you forgot to pack your camera.
1401080	1404060	Actually, yeah, sorry, you didn't roll to check
1404060	1405800	if the van had been robbed
1405800	1407900	while it was parked outside the studio.
1408760	1411600	Luke never said he actually got into the van.
1413840	1416600	So how are you guys doing with that Julius?
1416600	1417920	He's back at the station.
1417920	1420600	You were very good about like not jamming like that.
1420600	1423640	He's pretending to text his uncle.
1423640	1425640	That's just the thing, don't do that to your players.
1425640	1428040	If you're like a role player, like,
1428040	1431580	oh, you forgot to say Simon Says.
1433480	1435440	Yeah, don't play fucking Simon Says with your players.
1435440	1438200	That's a great rule of thumb for role playing.
1438200	1440200	Can I reiterate out of character real fast?
1440200	1441680	Isabelle Crane has, or.
1441680	1442520	Isabella Caya.
1442520	1445880	Isabella Caya has, can I reiterate real quick?
1445880	1448680	Isabella Caya has sent us to investigate
1448680	1452480	a secret company town, which is really fucking exciting
1452480	1454720	and weird and crazy.
1454720	1455560	Okay, cool.
1455560	1458880	Julius is stoked, but preoccupied with his uncle.
1458880	1460840	You're like looking at fucking TikTok.
1460840	1463940	Well, I'm like, why did I have to find this out
1463940	1466940	from Isabella Caya and not my uncle?
1466940	1471200	But then also looking up the songs we should use
1471200	1473440	in the background of our TikTok once we make.
1473440	1476640	Exactly, yeah, like trending hashtags today and.
1476640	1479460	Stevie notices that there are some very cool
1479460	1482100	driving gloves sitting up on the dash.
1482100	1485500	Oh, sorry, does someone else normally drive?
1485500	1488260	Julius kind of glances up and just goes,
1488260	1489420	put them on.
1489420	1491780	Oh, may I?
1491780	1492620	Put them on.
1496560	1498620	And she gets a plus 10 drive.
1498620	1499960	Oh, fuck yeah, she does.
1501140	1502420	And she rolled an aught too.
1502420	1503460	Yeah, tight.
1503460	1505020	Nice.
1505020	1507300	Okay, so you guys head outside of the city.
1507300	1511620	Immediately your can van jammed in this city traffic
1512060	1514340	just right off the bat and it takes a while
1514340	1516520	to get out into the interstate.
1516520	1518380	And Stevie's staying pretty quiet
1518380	1520000	until you get out on the highway.
1520000	1522340	But once you're out, she kind of looks
1522340	1525260	in the rear view mirror and she's like.
1525260	1528780	So do you guys, do you guys believe in ghosts?
1528780	1529960	Yeah, dude, yeah.
1529960	1530900	Oh, for real?
1530900	1531740	Yeah.
1531740	1532560	Have you seen one?
1532560	1533400	No.
1533400	1534240	Oh.
1534240	1536140	Some people at the station would tell you
1536140	1537400	you're looking at one.
1539360	1540200	Hi, kid.
1540200	1544720	I mean, I've seen things that they could be, dude.
1544720	1548240	What sort of ghosts are you talking about?
1548240	1550040	Oh, I just mean anything.
1550040	1551840	Do you guys think aliens are?
1551840	1554760	I'm just like, I just want to know
1554760	1557160	where your mind's at, you know?
1557160	1559800	You'd be like stupid not to believe in aliens.
1559800	1562500	Just probabilities or whatever, my dudes.
1562500	1563720	They gotta be out there.
1563720	1568640	I, you know, in college decided that they're out there.
1568640	1569640	Nice.
1569640	1571120	I want to believe.
1571120	1573460	Whoa, that's like Mulder, dude.
1573460	1574300	Who?
1574300	1576360	It's like a spooky dude who's like
1576360	1577720	into spooky stuff on a show.
1577720	1578640	You're like that dude.
1578640	1580000	Well, I am on a show.
1580000	1582960	Oh yeah, it's like double that way, yeah.
1582960	1584960	A pleasant conversation is always Beck.
1586880	1590240	The conversation continues and veers off
1590240	1594000	into different directions and then it kind of dies down
1594000	1597680	again and she gets that same sort of sound in her voice
1597720	1600680	and she's like, well, what do you guys think about like,
1600680	1604360	do you think it's possible to be like rich
1604360	1606000	and be a good person?
1606000	1608960	Like, do you think money corrupts absolutely?
1608960	1613540	Are you talking about Godel money or like?
1613540	1614380	Well, I mean.
1614380	1615920	More money than you make.
1615920	1618180	Well, certainly more money than I make,
1618180	1620020	but I mean, if we're heading out to talk about.
1620020	1622720	Well, we all certainly make a lot more money than you,
1622720	1625080	but does that make us bad people?
1625080	1626640	Well, I guess that's what I'm asking.
1626640	1628320	Do you think that making more money
1628320	1629880	has made you a worse person?
1629880	1632240	There was this one time where like I was like
1632240	1634600	putting on a coat for like the first time I had
1634600	1639240	like for all year and in that pocket there was 20 bucks
1639240	1642080	and I took that 20 bucks and I took Cal
1642080	1644880	and our old producer out to the foundry
1644880	1646920	and I got them all shots with it.
1646920	1648880	So I mean, I guess I'm kind of a case in point
1648880	1651440	that it doesn't have to corrupt absolutely.
1651440	1653780	I was rich and I helped my friends.
1654620	1656500	Wise words, Beckworth.
1658280	1659180	I like that.
1659180	1660780	Godel money though.
1660780	1662940	Yeah, what about like Godel money?
1662940	1663820	Godel money though.
1663820	1665180	Well, it's a good thing none of us
1665180	1666500	have to worry about that.
1668180	1672180	Yeah, for sure.
1673700	1674540	Humit?
1676380	1678900	Humit on Cal for having that much money?
1678900	1681580	No, I'm saying that as like I remember.
1681580	1683460	Oh, I thought it was Julius, I'm sorry.
1684060	1687100	Julius is related to the person that owns the news network.
1690100	1693460	And I got my job because they own the news network.
1693460	1695980	I don't think that's like Godel money though.
1695980	1696820	No, it's not.
1696820	1700740	That's like Monsanto money versus KY3 money.
1700740	1705740	Well, like better than KY3, but not like generational
1706640	1707480	billions.
1707480	1708300	No.
1708300	1709140	Exactly.
1709140	1710940	But Julius likes to think that it is.
1711820	1714980	I think you're gonna be just fine.
1714980	1716060	I'll be okay.
1716060	1718740	Just not enough to be a super villain.
1718740	1719640	How has it affected you?
1719640	1723500	I believe that I'm rich and you can tell from like
1723500	1724540	what I've said that.
1724540	1726340	We're all rich Luke in friendship.
1726340	1728940	You know that like Julius knows he's rich.
1728940	1729780	Okay.
1729780	1732740	But like he doesn't want you guys to know that,
1732740	1733820	but now you do.
1734740	1736700	Doesn't want us to know it or doesn't want us
1736700	1738580	to treat you differently because of it?
1738580	1740580	The first because of the second.
1741460	1744080	When you're about an hour outside the city,
1744080	1747040	you exit the interstate to a highway,
1747040	1750700	to a smaller highway, to a country road,
1750700	1752740	to another country road.
1752740	1757100	And the only signs around are for attractions behind you
1757100	1759860	with an easy place to turn around
1759860	1762260	within a minute of each sign.
1762260	1765780	And eventually the country road goes from asphalt
1765900	1770900	to gravel and a sign says road closed ahead,
1771100	1772960	please turn back.
1772960	1776620	Are we still on track to like where it's telling us to go?
1776620	1777920	Yeah, how far are we from the pen?
1777920	1780780	Stevie pulls up the navigation on her phone
1780780	1783500	and kind of holds it up near the rear view mirror
1783500	1784420	to show you guys.
1784420	1787500	And it's like, it says we're still going the right way.
1787500	1788620	Should I just keep going?
1788620	1789540	How far?
1789540	1792740	It looks like less than a mile.
1792740	1794740	Keep forward going.
1794740	1795980	Okay.
1795980	1798460	And she keeps driving and keeps going.
1798460	1801780	It twists, it turns, it's a gravel road.
1801780	1803960	The gravel road turns to dirt.
1803960	1807260	And at this point, there's just no signs anywhere.
1807260	1809340	There haven't been like streetlights
1809340	1811740	for miles at this point.
1811740	1816740	Here you see a sign that says stop dead end, no outlet.
1817100	1821180	I'm still going though.
1821180	1823140	There's another sign up there.
1823140	1825140	She points and as you guys approach that one,
1825140	1828420	it says danger road closed.
1828420	1830620	I think these signs are designed
1830620	1833380	merely to keep looky-loos out.
1833380	1834960	But we're the looky news.
1836620	1839360	She's like nervously laughing at that hilarious joke.
1839360	1840980	At this point, Beck is, like I said,
1840980	1842760	he's always taking B-roll out the windows and stuff.
1842760	1844720	But at this point, he's kind of crawled up to the front
1844720	1846580	between the passenger and the driver
1846580	1848180	and is filming out the front,
1848180	1849660	getting good shots of what we're seeing
1849660	1850500	as it's coming up on us.
1850500	1853780	Stevie, I think that you should just keep driving.
1853780	1858260	The road turns and suddenly you see that the road stops.
1858260	1863260	The dirt turns into a thick wall of brush.
1863860	1868400	So thick, so tall that you can't see through or over it.
1868400	1870680	And it goes left and right in all directions.
1870680	1872000	And it's actually so thick,
1872000	1873420	almost on either side of the road
1873420	1876220	that you wouldn't be able to walk too far into it
1876220	1881140	before you're waist high in verdant detritus.
1881140	1882860	Waist high, though?
1882860	1884420	Yeah, after a little bit, yeah.
1884420	1885340	It'd be about waist high.
1885340	1886180	So we can see over it?
1886180	1887060	Oh, no, no, no, sorry.
1887060	1888740	On the left and right, it's waist high.
1888740	1892420	Ahead of you, it's like three stories high
1892420	1894560	of just thicket and trees.
1894560	1897760	And there's kudzu laying over the top of these trees
1897760	1899260	so thick that you can't see through it.
1899260	1900560	Does it seem natural?
1900560	1902700	Does anyone have any sort of science role
1902700	1905380	or knowledge about plant life?
1905380	1907700	You can roll me an intelligence at a negative 40
1907700	1908940	if you'd like.
1908940	1909780	I'll try it.
1909780	1910600	I'll do that.
1912900	1913740	98.
1918420	1920180	It's a fail no matter what I get.
1920180	1921420	How many did you say minus?
1921420	1922300	40.
1922300	1925140	Yeah, that would put me at a 30 and I rolled a 34.
1925140	1926380	Oof. Very close.
1926380	1927520	Ouchie.
1927520	1931500	So you're not sure whether this plant life
1931500	1933100	naturally grows in this area,
1933100	1937300	but it's growing right next to all this other stuff.
1937300	1940880	It seems seamless as it grows into it all, so.
1940880	1945880	Do you guys know if we have a license to film in Egypt?
1946980	1951020	I get it, butt fucking Egypt, where we are.
1951020	1954620	I'm not sure that's the correct term,
1954620	1956740	but that was the joke.
1956740	1957980	What is the correct term?
1957980	1960380	Bum fuck Egypt.
1960380	1962860	No, it's butt fucking Egypt.
1963460	1964300	If we're talking out of character.
1964300	1965500	It's bum fuck Egypt.
1965500	1967860	If we're talking out of character.
1967860	1969700	I mean, hey, I looked at the tower,
1969700	1971500	you were totally right about that, but.
1971500	1972340	Oh.
1974500	1975940	Redemption.
1975940	1979380	BFE stands for either bum fuck or butt fuck Egypt.
1981460	1983220	So we're both right.
1983220	1985780	Somebody on a Reddit thread says bout fucking Egypt,
1985780	1986940	which is just dumb.
1986940	1988040	That's Reddit, baby.
1988040	1990340	It's gotta be about your butt, you know,
1990340	1991840	because that's what you fuck.
1992860	1996300	Does your butt hurt?
1996300	1997700	Do you want it to?
2002260	2003580	Julius makes that joke,
2003580	2006420	and then like whether or not Cal liked it,
2006420	2008780	he feels a deeper connection to Cal,
2008780	2012540	but also has no idea if these plants are real or not.
2012540	2013780	We've stopped the van at this point.
2013780	2014620	Yeah, it's.
2014620	2015660	Like the road has ended.
2015660	2020660	Yeah, but the pen shows on the other side of this like wall.
2020860	2023580	Beck wants to get out and take a camera
2023580	2025540	and go as close to the thicket as he can
2025540	2027280	and just kind of shove the lens in there
2027280	2031180	and do a big, as hard, as big a zoom as he can on this lens.
2031180	2032800	And just see if he sees,
2032800	2035040	if the lens penetrates better than his eyes can,
2035040	2035880	what's ahead.
2035880	2039660	Okay, go ahead and roll video.
2039660	2040700	Videographer.
2042020	2043060	While he rolls that,
2043060	2045500	can I roll to see if I can find like a,
2045500	2047860	something to cut through these vines?
2047860	2050300	Are you fucking kidding me, dude?
2050740	2052980	I have an 80 in this and I rolled a 90.
2052980	2053820	No.
2055420	2056660	God damn it.
2056660	2058920	So as you shove it into there,
2058920	2062780	you feel that it gets almost like trapped in a spot
2062780	2066340	where some sticks were facing out away from you.
2066340	2068980	You kind of pushed it in where it kind of latches back
2068980	2071660	onto them as you try to pull the camera back out,
2071660	2074240	but you're able to kind of wrestle it out
2074240	2076800	without damaging the camera at all.
2076800	2079360	And as you look at through the viewfinder
2079360	2081280	of what you just shot while it was
2081280	2083220	out of your view completely,
2084060	2088480	you see that it zooms into a leaf.
2089880	2092200	As this happens, Julius is like,
2092200	2093560	he's the new producer.
2093560	2098240	He wants to just like get to the story as fast as possible.
2098240	2101320	And thank you, I knocked my ones off earlier.
2103040	2108040	Will a two find me something to cut through this in the van?
2108040	2109000	Yeah, a two will.
2109520	2113440	So what is in the van that can cut through some thick brush?
2113440	2116560	With the two, there's a machete in there for some reason.
2118480	2121220	No, so the van used to have-
2121220	2124920	Giant scythes on the wheels there still.
2124920	2128000	The van used to have like little like curtains.
2128000	2129280	Forward, Stevie.
2129280	2131960	The van used to have curtains in the back
2131960	2135280	so that like people could edit in the back while they drove.
2135280	2137760	But now there's just no windows.
2137760	2140640	And for six months, Beck lived in there.
2140640	2143280	Laying down underneath one of the seats,
2143280	2146160	there's like the slider thing that the-
2146160	2147160	Curtain rod.
2147160	2148800	The curtain rod, yeah.
2148800	2150240	So I grabbed the curtain rod.
2150240	2152240	Yeah, so you grab the curtain rod
2152240	2154000	and you start swiping through.
2154000	2155280	And as you're doing that,
2155280	2157640	Stevie's kind of gotten out of the van as well
2157640	2159720	and is putting her hands in it
2159720	2162560	and just kind of like moving them around.
2162560	2164720	I don't know, maybe there's something here.
2164720	2166400	And then you guys hear a boom.
2167920	2171360	Julius, you feel like you've connected
2171360	2175480	with something thick and steel with this rod.
2175480	2177240	Like it feels like metal on metal.
2177240	2178080	Yeah.
2178080	2178920	Oh shit.
2178920	2180920	Yeah, we're talking certain parts
2180920	2184200	of the periodic table in your hands here.
2184200	2187600	Have I like, like before I hit the metal, did I cut-
2187600	2188440	The hard parts.
2189560	2193000	Before I hit the metal, did I like cut any like foliage?
2193000	2195520	Yeah, I mean, you can keep kind of pushing it away
2195520	2196760	from where you've dunked
2196760	2201000	and you can see that there's a bit of steel,
2201000	2204000	the plant life growing up on it and around it.
2204000	2205800	As soon as Beck heard the dunk,
2205800	2206920	he would have whipped around
2206920	2208880	and started filming what's going on there.
2208880	2209720	Yeah.
2209720	2211160	Yeah, Julius is just gonna use the curtain rod
2211160	2215600	to try to like scrape stuff off of the like metal
2215600	2219240	that he hit to like try to reveal whatever it is.
2219240	2224240	And as you do so, you notice that there seems to be
2224480	2228280	some paint on the steel.
2228280	2230880	As you push the thicket and brush
2230880	2234200	and all of this plant life out of the way
2234200	2239080	with your curtain rod,
2239080	2241440	you push enough away to show
2241440	2245960	where this paint on the steel is showing.
2245960	2248400	There's actually an arrow and you reveal an arrow
2248400	2249720	that's pointing to the left.
2249720	2252800	And as you push more away, there's above it,
2252840	2254360	it says door.
2254360	2255520	What color arrow?
2255520	2257480	You move some more, it's a yellow arrow.
2257480	2259040	I knew it was gonna be yellow.
2259040	2260320	Fuck, it's a green arrow.
2260320	2261560	Oh, okay.
2261560	2263720	Yeah, that makes sense if you're wanting to hide it.
2263720	2266240	And green is pretty industrial and like a...
2266240	2267680	Yeah, good choice.
2267680	2271200	And like a modern evil corporation
2271200	2273400	that wants to hide that it's an evil corporation.
2273400	2274240	That's right.
2274240	2277200	Yellow on like steel is just classic bad guy shit.
2277200	2279800	I look at Beck, obviously just like pointing
2279800	2282760	to like get some footage of what I've just revealed.
2283600	2285440	Beck sets up a nice shot that has it centered.
2285440	2286280	Perfect.
2286280	2287680	Yeah, I wanna just start clearing
2287680	2290160	whether it's like scraping or swiping
2290160	2291800	or whatever I need to do
2291800	2294400	to get to where that arrow is pointing.
2294400	2299400	And the sun is coming into full force.
2300040	2304560	It's about 1030 a.m. now on this July 5th.
2304560	2306200	But it's gonna be cloudy later in the day
2306200	2309360	so the sun right now, it's full.
2309360	2312720	It's doing everything it can
2313560	2314400	while it can.
2315840	2320680	Would you say it's around 96 degrees at this point in time?
2320680	2325680	Yeah, but it feels like 98 and sweat is picking up.
2326200	2329760	You are actively getting moist while doing this work.
2329760	2333840	And I'm like whacking, I'm like, I'm going all out
2333840	2337520	whacking with this curtain rod that is like so bent.
2337560	2342520	Like little pieces of it are like falling off
2342520	2343360	while I'm doing it.
2343360	2346200	You guys look back, you see Stevie is crushing
2346200	2349780	her second canned cold brew of the trip.
2350640	2355640	And she brings over one energy drink to Mr. Wilder
2356640	2360120	and brings another Coke over to Mr. Colorado.
2360120	2361280	She somehow kept it cold.
2361280	2362920	She's like, I brought a cooler.
2362920	2364480	Stevie, you are...
2364800	2369800	Thank you, oh, you said everything.
2371440	2374720	A newsman without words, oh wow, what a compliment.
2374720	2375680	Stevie, would you?
2375680	2376800	Am I a wonder?
2376800	2381500	Like an improv podcaster without words, it never happens.
2382760	2386520	Julius, yeah, asks Stevie, would you mind?
2386520	2388200	And hands her the curtain rod.
2388200	2389260	Yeah, for sure.
2389260	2391600	First of all, I mean, energy drink is funny
2391640	2395120	but like when we get Coke as a sponsor,
2395120	2396480	I'll be the one laughing.
2397320	2399360	You guys are gonna wish you said monster.
2401360	2402640	Call your shots.
2402640	2404600	We can't, we wouldn't get Red Bull.
2405980	2408120	So Stevie will take this crumpled.
2409160	2411720	In my mind, it's mostly crumpled
2411720	2416160	but there's like one foot of like solid curtain rod.
2416160	2419240	Yeah, and she's gonna use that to just basically
2419240	2422520	push up against the steel where you've left off
2422520	2426240	and then drag it forcefully to the left
2426240	2428420	is just kind of heading toward this arrow.
2428420	2431880	You guys have made it probably eight feet of clearing
2431880	2435080	by this point and it's taken like 15 minutes.
2435080	2438040	Can I do like a search roll through this foliage
2438040	2440680	to see if I can find more of an easy point of access?
2440680	2443160	Yeah, absolutely, go ahead and roll.
2443160	2446840	Wait, okay, yeah, I was afraid of that.
2446840	2449560	That's a 66 on a 60, that's a critical failure.
2454000	2455620	You went to the right.
2455620	2458100	Well, I like, I trip into some of the foliage
2458100	2460240	like trying to point out something
2460240	2464400	and a bunch of our progress is eliminated, I think,
2464400	2466560	like 15 more minutes of hacking
2466560	2469040	because I brought down a bunch of vines and shit.
2469040	2470760	And Cal, as you trip.
2470760	2472480	I think I see something, fellas.
2472480	2475880	You trip and knock over a bunch of vines
2475880	2477640	which at first everyone thinks
2477640	2480340	is going to cause a deep impediment
2480340	2485340	but it actually reveals a thick metal hatch door.
2486380	2489920	And as you begin to pick yourself up off the ground,
2489920	2494920	you look down and see that you have fallen into poison oak.
2495360	2496400	Oh.
2496400	2498000	I was wondering, I was like,
2498000	2501800	we can't go through the door, it came from a crisp hill.
2501800	2503680	I was like, what the fuck?
2503680	2504920	We're not gonna go that way.
2504960	2506780	It seems like you really screwed up
2506780	2509240	and that's the bad thing that happened.
2509240	2511560	Cal, cover that up slowly.
2511560	2512920	We never saw the hatch.
2513840	2516340	Cal's like, no, my news hands.
2518580	2520160	So until you get this cleared up,
2520160	2522160	you're gonna be at a negative 20%
2522160	2524600	because you're gonna be dealing with how itchy you are.
2524600	2525440	To everything?
2525440	2526360	Yeah. Okay.
2526360	2529080	Stevie, Stevie, do you have any salve?
2529080	2530040	Actually, you know what?
2530040	2531880	It's gonna give you a plus,
2531880	2533660	it's gonna take away 20 on everything
2533660	2536140	but it's gonna give you a plus 20 on grip
2536140	2539660	because you're way more focused on your own body
2539660	2540900	than the world around you.
2540900	2543000	That's really cool.
2543000	2544100	I thought you meant grip.
2544100	2547460	Like, I was like, Zach, think about that.
2547460	2548780	Plus 20 to climb.
2548780	2551380	That's because your hands are so sticky
2551380	2553620	from them being just blisters.
2553620	2558020	My Cal ooze lets me cling to walls.
2558020	2560340	No, I actually really like that.
2560340	2563380	Like physical pain keeps you distracted from-
2563980	2564800	From your mental pain?
2564800	2565640	Yeah.
2565640	2566480	Flagellation, baby.
2568340	2571300	So plus 20 grip, minus 20 everything else?
2571300	2572120	Yep.
2572120	2575020	Whoa, Cal, you did it, man.
2575020	2576680	That's the door.
2576680	2578820	I suppose I did.
2578820	2580820	Let's see if there's a pin behind there.
2583040	2584140	No, no, Cal.
2584140	2584960	Yeah, all right.
2584960	2586000	Yeah, let's see if there's a pin.
2586000	2590460	I need you guys to stand back for a little bit.
2590460	2594500	Obviously, we need you to record the whole thing
2594500	2596500	and you're the face.
2596500	2598540	And I try to open the hatch up.
2602700	2605860	As you turn the wheel of this enormous metal hatch
2607980	2610500	into open, unlocked position
2610500	2614740	and with almost a free momentum
2614740	2616580	without giving any weight push at all.
2616580	2620340	As if it was like a hydraulic system to open up.
2621180	2624260	This door just, I'm gonna do it again.
2624260	2627060	Wait, is it going like this or like this?
2627060	2628900	Like a normal door, like a normal door.
2628900	2629740	I thought you said it was a hatch.
2629740	2632140	Yeah, I was picturing it on the ground too.
2632140	2637140	You said he fell onto, like a metal door.
2637180	2641260	I only use the word hatch and I keep doing this to you guys.
2641260	2643720	But when I say hatch, I just mean one of those
2643720	2647120	like a thick metal doors like in a submarine.
2647120	2649060	Yeah, like a SpongeBob door.
2649060	2650740	But not necessarily round.
2650740	2651580	Exactly.
2651580	2652420	Gotcha.
2652420	2653460	Yeah, this is magic.
2653460	2655880	Okay, cool, I gotcha, perfectly.
2657260	2658340	Like 007.
2658340	2660580	A door that you open with a cool spinny thing.
2660580	2663420	Yeah, the cool spinny thing does that noise.
2663420	2664980	Those can be round, but this one is not.
2664980	2666380	Just to make sure.
2666380	2669420	This is vertical door leading into the structure
2669420	2672620	that we were previously hacking at, right?
2672620	2676020	Yep, and it's the one that the arrow was pointing at.
2676020	2676860	That too.
2676860	2677980	Cool.
2677980	2680420	I go in if it opens.
2680420	2683460	Beck wants to turn on the light of his camera.
2683460	2686420	It is not dark on the other side.
2686420	2687780	In fact, it's quite bright.
2690480	2692420	And as the three of you walk through,
2692420	2694940	Stevie right behind you on your tail,
2694940	2695780	carrying all of your gear.
2695780	2697100	Beck has a tail, by the way.
2697100	2699460	Heh heh heh heh heh heh.
2699460	2701460	Riding Beck's tail.
2701460	2702540	Stan Stevie is three inches tall.
2702540	2704540	Listening to Julius' tail.
2704540	2707500	Heh heh heh heh heh heh.
2707940	2711860	On the other side of this enormous and lush impediment
2711860	2716460	is a vast opening with plenty to unpack.
2716460	2719140	He said vast opening with plenty to unpack.
2719140	2723780	First, you see an unnecessarily massive bridge,
2723780	2727780	20 meters tall and 100 meters long.
2727780	2730860	This bridge is a minimalist construction
2730860	2734700	showcasing the steel that seems to be the only way
2734700	2739700	over this deep, wide and foggy ravine.
2740940	2743820	On your side of this bridge,
2743820	2748380	a single simple steel train car is waiting
2748380	2753100	in a simple steel single train car sized train station,
2753100	2758100	presumably here to take you across this awe inducing chasm.
2758220	2761660	On the outside of this minimalist depot,
2761660	2766060	above a wall of lockers is a sign that says,
2766060	2769300	Welcome to Grover's Gorge,
2769300	2774220	founded by Frank Godel in 1945
2774220	2776780	by necessity, not choice.
2777620	2780620	My life is great
2780620	2784780	And it's all my fault
2784780	2789780	Cause my life is great
2789780	2791780	And it's all mine
2799260	2804140	Cause my life is great
2804140	2807180	And it's all my fault
