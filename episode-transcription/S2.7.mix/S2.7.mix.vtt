00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
Welcome, brothers, sisters, and siblings.

00:04.400 --> 00:08.200
It's your ethereal pup god, Wolf the Dog.

00:08.200 --> 00:11.400
Blessings to you all, my children.

00:11.400 --> 00:19.600
And I'm hollerin' from the heavens and the hells at you live from 694.2 PTBP.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.800
A station of radio.

00:21.800 --> 00:25.700
It's definitely somewhere at some time.

00:25.800 --> 00:31.200
You know how most companies exclude their employees for participating in drawings,

00:31.200 --> 00:35.200
so they can't be accused of manipulating the outcome?

00:35.200 --> 00:40.900
Apparently that's not the case here at 694.2 PTBP,

00:40.900 --> 00:46.000
cuz this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Joe Terry in Springfield, Missouri,

00:46.000 --> 00:49.900
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,

00:49.900 --> 00:52.400
which is self-promotion when he does it,

00:52.400 --> 00:55.600
but it's super fuckin' cool when y'all do it.

00:55.700 --> 00:58.000
Joe Terry writes,

00:58.000 --> 00:59.200
Hey, dog.

00:59.200 --> 01:03.200
You know how companies exclude their employees from drawings?

01:03.200 --> 01:05.400
I don't think they're doin' that here,

01:05.400 --> 01:09.900
so I want you to say Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip

01:09.900 --> 01:14.600
is an underrated Aaron Sorkin show that I wish more people saw.

01:14.600 --> 01:19.100
Bradley Whitford and Matthew Perry turn in electric performances

01:19.100 --> 01:24.100
as co-showrunners of a Saturday Night Live-type program.

01:24.100 --> 01:26.000
It got one season.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.600
I want more.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.000
Love ya, dog.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Hope the slop is sloppy.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.900
You will, Joe.

01:33.900 --> 01:35.600
Sweet Joe.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.800
I love you too, buddy.

01:37.800 --> 01:42.100
One day we shall frolic in the slop together as one,

01:42.100 --> 01:44.900
but you shall feed me your life force

01:44.900 --> 01:50.000
so that I may continue to live on and grow in power.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.300
Do not worry, dear sweet delicious Joe.

01:54.300 --> 01:58.800
Do not tremble when the darkness fills your vision,

01:58.800 --> 02:00.600
surrounding you,

02:00.600 --> 02:05.000
when you feel fangs scraping along the back of your neck,

02:05.000 --> 02:08.500
when all of your senses start to fail you

02:08.500 --> 02:15.400
and you feel yourself slowly but surely dissolving from this time.

02:15.400 --> 02:19.900
We will become one, Joe.

02:19.900 --> 02:25.700
And you start to think maybe we always were.

02:25.700 --> 02:28.500
Welcome back, Joe.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.300
The links are in the damn show notes.

02:31.300 --> 02:32.400
The news.

02:32.400 --> 02:35.600
Last time, the City Action News field team

02:35.600 --> 02:38.700
took a single simple steel train car

02:38.700 --> 02:41.500
across an awe-inspiring bridge

02:41.500 --> 02:45.300
that ran over an unnaturally smooth chasm

02:45.300 --> 02:49.700
filled with fog and an upside-down church.

02:49.700 --> 02:54.400
A pre-recorded Fred Godel from the TVs in the train car

02:54.400 --> 02:58.400
welcomed them to Godel's Gate to Grover's Gorge.

02:58.400 --> 03:01.500
Through the next Spongebob-y hatch door

03:01.500 --> 03:07.300
was a town ripped from futuristic concept art of the 1950s.

03:07.300 --> 03:12.700
The first thing Julius wanted in Grover's Gorge was an interview.

03:12.700 --> 03:17.300
And while they talked to a great employee of the Godel Company,

03:17.300 --> 03:20.300
a GE of the TGC,

03:20.300 --> 03:25.500
they noticed hopping along the synthetic track they all stood on,

03:25.500 --> 03:26.900
a jackalope,

03:26.900 --> 03:29.800
taking you back to this mythical critter.

03:29.800 --> 03:33.500
It's a whimsical tomb and it's time to get litter.

03:33.500 --> 03:39.900
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My False.

03:39.900 --> 03:43.900
And it's all my fault

03:43.900 --> 03:48.900
Cause my life is great

03:48.900 --> 03:51.900
And it's all mine

03:58.400 --> 04:03.400
Cause my life is great

04:03.400 --> 04:06.900
And it's all my fault

04:09.900 --> 04:15.900
And it's all mine

04:15.900 --> 04:18.100
Welcome back to Pretending to Be People.

04:18.100 --> 04:22.000
You are now listening to what I think is probably episode 7.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.400
Mr. Joe Terry, tell me what's a weird dream that you've had?

04:25.400 --> 04:25.900
Ever?

04:25.900 --> 04:26.900
Yeah.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.700
What's like the weirdest dream that you've had?

04:28.700 --> 04:30.200
I don't have a good answer to this.

04:30.200 --> 04:33.300
Oh, I mean, there's one I've remembered for some reason since I was a kid.

04:33.300 --> 04:34.100
Awesome.

04:34.100 --> 04:37.900
I'm running down the hillside and it's like the Windows XP background,

04:37.900 --> 04:40.800
like beautiful lush green hills and beautiful clouds,

04:40.800 --> 04:47.500
and I'm leading an army of giant ants toward like a hole at the bottom of the ground.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.300
Are you an ant?

04:48.300 --> 04:49.000
I hope that's a prophet.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.700
I'm like running fast.

04:50.700 --> 04:54.100
I'm not an ant, no, but I'm like running fast and it's like joyous.

04:54.100 --> 04:56.300
Like it's not scary or dangerous or anything.

04:56.300 --> 04:58.300
We're like a stampede of giant ants running toward it.

04:58.300 --> 04:59.700
It's like the most joyous dream I've ever heard of.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.100
Yeah, that's so cool.

05:02.100 --> 05:05.100
I don't know if that's weird though.

05:08.900 --> 05:11.900
What do you guys remember from where we left off?

05:11.900 --> 05:12.900
Where are we at?

05:12.900 --> 05:13.800
What are we doing?

05:13.800 --> 05:15.000
Are we in the normal world?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.200
Are we just like hanging out at the news station?

05:17.200 --> 05:17.700
No, man.

05:17.700 --> 05:18.300
Are we in the city?

05:18.300 --> 05:22.100
No, we're out on assignment and shit is not normal, Zach.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.100
We're not in the city.

05:23.100 --> 05:25.000
We're in Walmart country.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.500
Where the shit is really real.

05:26.500 --> 05:31.700
We're out in the boonies and we are in an impossible town that should not exist,

05:31.700 --> 05:34.300
surrounded by impossible geography,

05:34.300 --> 05:39.100
and we just saw a fucking Jackalope and news team is going to get some goddamn

05:39.100 --> 05:40.000
answers for the people.

05:40.000 --> 05:40.700
I can tell you that.

05:42.500 --> 05:42.900
Awesome.

05:42.900 --> 05:44.000
So, uh, Luke,

05:44.000 --> 05:48.300
can you describe the landscape in which you are standing currently?

05:48.300 --> 05:50.900
Yeah, Grover's Gorge.

05:50.900 --> 05:51.300
Nice.

05:51.300 --> 05:51.800
Got it.

05:51.800 --> 05:52.400
Nailed it.

05:52.400 --> 05:55.000
You can describe the city in one word.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.500
I would say weird.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.700
The landscape weird.

05:58.700 --> 05:59.800
The people weird.

05:59.800 --> 06:04.200
It's a huge space age city with bouncy colorful synthetic walkways.

06:04.200 --> 06:04.700
Awesome.

06:04.700 --> 06:05.500
Nice notes.

06:05.500 --> 06:06.400
Very good notes.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.400
Do you have luck right now?

06:07.400 --> 06:08.500
Uh, I don't think so.

06:08.500 --> 06:08.900
Actually.

06:08.900 --> 06:09.700
You have luck now.

06:09.700 --> 06:10.300
Oh, sweet.

06:10.300 --> 06:10.800
Sick.

06:10.800 --> 06:11.400
I like those.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.100
I like those thorough notes.

06:13.900 --> 06:14.700
There's two statues.

06:14.700 --> 06:15.400
Joe's like,

06:15.400 --> 06:16.500
what the fuck?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.200
No, I was trying to find a clip.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.200
Do you guys remember,

06:25.200 --> 06:25.900
um,

06:25.900 --> 06:30.000
Dave Coulier hosted a show that was kind of like America's home videos,

06:30.000 --> 06:31.500
but it had a Jackalope.

06:31.500 --> 06:32.300
Do you remember this?

06:32.300 --> 06:36.200
You're thinking of Bob Saget hosting America's home videos.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.900
Are you throwing us off because Thomas took good notes?

06:38.900 --> 06:39.400
Oh shit.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.200
No,

06:40.200 --> 06:41.600
this is just his little tantrum.

06:43.400 --> 06:44.000
I have no,

06:44.000 --> 06:45.600
I have no recollection of this.

06:45.600 --> 06:46.900
Coulier time.

06:46.900 --> 06:47.700
Yeah.

06:47.700 --> 06:47.900
Um,

06:47.900 --> 06:50.500
I'm going to start taking notes once I use my point of luck.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.300
Just when you thought it was safe to check the mailbox,

06:52.300 --> 06:53.300
Jackalope 3,

06:53.300 --> 06:55.600
tower came COD.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.800
So Dave Coulier does the Jackalope's voice

07:01.800 --> 07:04.100
and it's just a rabbit that they've tied horns to

07:04.100 --> 07:05.200
and they do bits with it.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.000
It's a real dead rabbit.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
It's like a taxidermy rabbit that they've attached horns to.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
That's awesome.

07:10.000 --> 07:10.100
Well,

07:10.100 --> 07:14.600
the one that you guys are looking at here in Grover's Gorge is alive

07:14.600 --> 07:18.200
and it is just kind of hopping on this synthetic walkway

07:18.200 --> 07:20.600
that people are jogging and walking on.

07:20.600 --> 07:20.900
Zach,

07:20.900 --> 07:23.400
where is it between us and the massive square park?

07:23.400 --> 07:24.200
Ooh,

07:24.200 --> 07:24.700
nice.

07:24.700 --> 07:28.700
I would say that it is in between you in the massive square park.

07:28.700 --> 07:28.900
Oh,

07:28.900 --> 07:31.000
you can't have more than just luck,

07:31.000 --> 07:32.600
but I'd give it to you again.

07:32.600 --> 07:32.900
Ooh,

07:32.900 --> 07:34.100
I'd give it to you again.

07:34.100 --> 07:34.200
Oh,

07:34.200 --> 07:34.400
no,

07:34.400 --> 07:34.600
no,

07:34.600 --> 07:35.200
I just want,

07:35.200 --> 07:36.100
I just want your praise.

07:36.100 --> 07:40.600
And what's across that massive square park where people are hanging out

07:40.600 --> 07:45.300
in either green or yellow tinted or accented uniforms.

07:45.300 --> 07:46.600
What's on the other side of that park?

07:46.600 --> 07:47.600
I bet Joe knows.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.000
Is it two big statues?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.300
It is two big statues.

07:51.300 --> 07:51.600
Yeah,

07:51.600 --> 07:54.500
they're about twenty six point three meters tall.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.100
In fact,

07:55.100 --> 07:57.400
and they're made of green rock.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.800
I've already said that.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.200
What's on the other side of the statue,

08:01.200 --> 08:05.100
labs?

08:05.100 --> 08:05.400
Yeah,

08:05.400 --> 08:11.300
it's a building that is made of glass and marble.

08:11.300 --> 08:15.300
It rhymes ass.

08:15.300 --> 08:16.500
Brass.

08:16.500 --> 08:17.700
Brass.

08:17.700 --> 08:18.600
Grass.

08:18.600 --> 08:22.000
Grass and ass.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.500
Ass glass of grass.

08:25.500 --> 08:28.200
Off to your left side from your current view,

08:28.200 --> 08:29.900
you see housing,

08:29.900 --> 08:30.500
beautiful,

08:30.500 --> 08:30.900
beautiful,

08:30.900 --> 08:32.200
gorgeous housing.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.300
And then off to the right,

08:33.300 --> 08:41.800
you can just barely make out some buildings that are poking over some perfectly cylindrical trees.

08:41.800 --> 08:42.100
Beck,

08:42.100 --> 08:44.000
what do you think that to the left is?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
What would you say those buildings look like?

08:46.000 --> 08:46.300
I don't know,

08:46.300 --> 08:46.600
Zach,

08:46.600 --> 08:47.000
what are they?

08:47.000 --> 08:54.200
And you see a whole line of beautiful homes that are like beautiful suburban homes.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.100
They're all unique to each other though.

08:56.100 --> 09:04.300
They all have their own special flair to them and they're enough apart to where you think it wouldn't be an issue to like hear your neighbors or anything.

09:04.300 --> 09:05.600
There's definitely privacy.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.900
Do I get a vibe of like the decade that these are?

09:08.900 --> 09:12.100
Space age was the word you used to describe this place.

09:12.100 --> 09:15.000
And so those are to the west.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.100
Those are to the west.

09:16.100 --> 09:17.800
If you came from the south,

09:17.800 --> 09:18.200
to the west,

09:18.200 --> 09:20.200
to the west.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.900
Headin' west like you're blowing Kanye.

09:22.900 --> 09:23.300
Oh,

09:23.300 --> 09:25.000
nice.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.500
Childish Gambino line for you there.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.800
They both like oohed and aahed.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.300
You should have just said it was yours.

09:31.300 --> 09:32.300
I thought it was yours.

09:32.300 --> 09:34.600
I'm Donald Glover.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.900
Donald Glover.

09:36.900 --> 09:37.100
Oh,

09:37.100 --> 09:38.400
dong lover?

09:38.400 --> 09:38.600
Oh,

09:38.600 --> 09:39.000
dong lover?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.300
Dong lover.

09:40.300 --> 09:40.600
Okay,

09:40.600 --> 09:41.300
these statues,

09:41.300 --> 09:44.900
how are their dongs?

09:44.900 --> 09:46.500
From this distance,

09:46.500 --> 09:58.100
you would assume you're not sure how big they are proportionally based because you're just too far away to make out the subtleties of these statues.

09:58.100 --> 09:58.700
However,

09:58.700 --> 10:05.400
you can assume based on the enormity of the statues that the dongs might have a similar weight to them.

10:05.400 --> 10:05.800
Interesting.

10:05.800 --> 10:08.800
The dongs weigh as much as the statues or at least a similar amount.

10:08.800 --> 10:09.900
They've got dense dongs.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.400
The dongs take up.

10:12.400 --> 10:15.900
I feel like my words are being misunderstood here.

10:15.900 --> 10:16.200
What?

10:16.200 --> 10:16.500
No,

10:16.500 --> 10:20.500
not deliberately.

10:20.500 --> 10:23.000
So two giant dong statues.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.900
Remind me what the statues look like.

10:24.900 --> 10:26.100
They're big penises.

10:26.100 --> 10:26.500
Men.

10:26.500 --> 10:27.800
They are two men.

10:27.800 --> 10:28.800
Are they doing anything?

10:28.800 --> 10:35.900
One is standing with hands in his pockets and the other one is standing with hands kind of on his hips.

10:35.900 --> 10:39.100
We're kind of familiar with what the more famous Godels look like.

10:39.100 --> 10:39.900
Yeah.

10:39.900 --> 10:40.700
Are these the Godels?

10:40.700 --> 10:41.900
These are these the Godels.

10:41.900 --> 10:47.300
The one with the hands on the hips is Frank Godel Grand Granddaddy Godel.

10:47.300 --> 10:57.200
And the one playing pocket pool with his statue hog is Fred Godel who you saw in the video in the train on the way into Grover's Gorge.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.400
Which is his son.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.300
Which is his son.

10:59.300 --> 10:59.700
Yes,

10:59.700 --> 11:08.500
and you would just know from general worldly knowledge that Fred Godel does have both a daughter and a son.

11:08.500 --> 11:14.800
Fox and the Hound.

11:14.800 --> 11:15.100
Yeah,

11:15.100 --> 11:19.500
Fox and Faith Fox and Faith Godel.

11:19.500 --> 11:19.800
F.

11:19.800 --> 11:20.100
Yeah,

11:20.100 --> 11:22.400
dude.

11:22.400 --> 11:23.900
Some people do that.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.000
Frank Godel.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
This Frank Godel that did all the mythological fighting.

11:30.000 --> 11:30.800
That is correct.

11:30.800 --> 11:31.000
Yes,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.200
according to the story told on the train.

11:33.200 --> 11:36.900
Some people name their kids mostly like their sons like the same name.

11:36.900 --> 11:39.000
It's fucking weird as hell,

11:39.000 --> 11:39.500
dude.

11:39.500 --> 11:40.600
Must be confusing.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.600
I would never name an NPC with the same name as another NPC.

11:43.600 --> 11:43.800
No,

11:43.800 --> 11:48.500
you wouldn't ever do that.

11:48.500 --> 11:51.400
So you guys are all standing on this.

11:51.400 --> 11:54.000
It's kind of a bouncy pathway.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.700
You're talking to Jennifer who is from here.

11:56.700 --> 11:57.400
She's a GE.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.600
She's a great employee.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.800
She said for the Godel company here in Grover's Gorge.

12:01.800 --> 12:06.800
She was born and raised here and has worked for the Godel company for a few years now.

12:07.100 --> 12:09.500
She's in her like early to mid 20s.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.900
And now the corner of your eyes,

12:11.900 --> 12:21.000
you all noticed a Jackalope kind of hopping across this bouncy walkway that others are exercising and jogging on.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.100
Some people are paying it a little bit of attention,

12:23.100 --> 12:23.500
you know,

12:23.500 --> 12:29.900
pointing at it going woo woo.

12:29.900 --> 12:33.000
Classic reaction to an animal.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.700
And you see that it has a yellow ribbon tied around its head around its antlers.

12:37.700 --> 12:38.200
Cal says,

12:38.200 --> 12:45.000
what the hell is even that?

12:45.000 --> 12:48.700
Woo woo yeah go GE's hungry for points.

12:48.700 --> 12:52.200
And she kind of like motions with her hand to a couple others

12:52.200 --> 12:58.100
and they all kind of run around and make a circle around this Jackalope that's sitting on the ground

12:58.100 --> 13:00.600
and they hold each other's hands and they go,

13:00.600 --> 13:03.800
I'm a GE of TGC.

13:03.800 --> 13:06.500
I'm a GE of TCG.

13:06.500 --> 13:10.000
Hey, I'm a GE of TGC.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.100
I'm a GE of TGC.

13:13.100 --> 13:16.700
And then she kind of like laughs and Saunders back to you guys.

13:16.700 --> 13:18.400
Well, so as as they're like doing that,

13:18.400 --> 13:23.600
I'm Cal is like motioning back and Julius forward to like run up to the circle and get a shot.

13:23.600 --> 13:24.500
Definitely doing that.

13:24.500 --> 13:24.800
Yeah.

13:24.800 --> 13:30.200
Yeah as they part do we see a real Jackalope or is there visibly like glue on its fucking head

13:30.200 --> 13:37.400
or no, but you would notice that I yeah looks like these antlers are tied on with a yellow ribbon.

13:37.400 --> 13:44.400
Seemingly the question I had was like when they're chanting the that stuff are you on purpose saying?

13:44.400 --> 13:45.000
No, sorry.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
That was my question also,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.400
so we should always hear it as TGC.

13:48.400 --> 13:48.700
Yeah.

13:48.700 --> 13:52.200
Okay, my bad because you consistently were doing it the second time you were saying it.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.700
So I thought you were saying oh my god.

13:53.700 --> 13:56.800
That's because I typed it wrong.

13:56.800 --> 14:00.100
No, it's because I'm an idiot.

14:00.100 --> 14:12.100
Same thing I was like I was like we need to ask about what what is GTC.

14:12.100 --> 14:15.100
I knew you were just fucking up.

14:15.100 --> 14:16.800
Thank you Thomas.

14:16.800 --> 14:23.800
Thanks for not reading into that look double luck.

14:23.800 --> 14:26.700
I just can't take that back baby when I think of you.

14:26.700 --> 14:31.100
I think of you like your freaking mastermind that has every single detail planned out.

14:31.100 --> 14:33.300
So I'm like you're hiding something from us you fucker.

14:33.300 --> 14:37.000
He's got you so fooled.

14:37.000 --> 14:43.700
Julius is definitely recording on his phone like trying to get up as close to the Jackalope as possible.

14:43.700 --> 14:45.300
Is it does it seem scared?

14:45.300 --> 14:47.700
No, it does not seem scared.

14:47.700 --> 14:50.700
It is very very calm Beck wouldn't want to break the circle,

14:50.700 --> 14:54.300
but he would want to put his camera between the heads of two people to film directly down.

14:54.300 --> 14:56.100
Do they react to me doing that at all?

14:56.100 --> 14:57.100
No, not at all.

14:57.100 --> 14:57.900
That's a great shot.

14:57.900 --> 15:00.700
What are you guys?

15:00.700 --> 15:03.000
What are you guys doing?

15:03.000 --> 15:05.500
I've asked the people around the Jackalope.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.400
Oh, hey, what's up?

15:07.400 --> 15:07.900
Oh, hi.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.000
Hey, how's it going?

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Uh, oh, yeah.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.200
No, we're just celebrating our points.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.600
Hey hungry for points.

15:14.600 --> 15:17.500
Do you eat the Jackalope?

15:17.500 --> 15:22.300
Oh, do you eat Jackalope?

15:22.300 --> 15:26.600
No, rabbit stew.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.600
I oh goodness.

15:28.600 --> 15:31.500
No, I have you ever been to Charlie's next to the foundry.

15:31.500 --> 15:36.100
They all kind of laugh at each other and are giggling amongst themselves and in unison.

15:36.100 --> 15:39.200
They say we don't need to eat.

15:39.200 --> 15:46.100
Uh, how does this Jackalope signify your points or why are you celebrating around it?

15:46.100 --> 15:47.800
Why you are all wearing yellow?

15:47.800 --> 15:49.400
Why is it got a yellow ribbon?

15:49.400 --> 15:51.800
What?

15:51.800 --> 15:54.200
What?

15:54.200 --> 15:55.600
No, that's a great question.

15:55.600 --> 15:55.800
Yeah.

15:55.800 --> 16:01.300
No, so the Jackalopes, they run free and they're not actually Jackalopes.

16:01.300 --> 16:08.800
Yes, I noticed I thought there might be but then the last little part of me that believed in magic died.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.300
That's so sad.

16:10.300 --> 16:19.100
They all kind of laugh like we still have magic here and they kind of laugh some more and she's like earlier this morning.

16:19.100 --> 16:32.400
We had a little contest where we let some rabbits run free and whoever could wrap their ribbon around the the rabbit's head and tie on the antlers to make a Jackalope got points.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.700
I didn't tell you about the points.

16:33.700 --> 16:35.000
The points is the best part.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.400
Well, yeah, we asked but you never quite explained.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.400
What do the points are in you?

16:38.400 --> 16:39.700
Of course I get ahead of myself.

16:39.700 --> 16:42.000
I'm just so excited and happy to be here.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Well, Jennifer, we can certainly see that.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.900
No, so I'm so hungry for points because when we get points we could win.

16:48.900 --> 16:50.600
Win what?

16:50.600 --> 16:53.300
Oh, the prize at the end of each quarter, there's a prize.

16:53.300 --> 16:54.500
The fiscal quarter?

16:54.500 --> 16:56.100
Yeah, of course.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.100
What is the price?

16:57.100 --> 16:59.900
Whether the GEs or the EEs win.

16:59.900 --> 17:00.900
I'm sorry, EEs?

17:00.900 --> 17:02.400
Yeah, excellent employees.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.900
There's great employees, there's excellent employees.

17:04.900 --> 17:13.300
Those are the green ones and she kind of points around and you see some people who are wearing the same like similar really nice kind of athleisure.

17:13.400 --> 17:17.000
But their accents are green as opposed to yellow, which is what?

17:17.000 --> 17:18.500
What does green sound like?

17:18.500 --> 17:19.000
What?

17:19.000 --> 17:19.800
It was a bad joke.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.200
Their accents are green.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.000
Like Ireland.

17:23.700 --> 17:30.600
Excellent employees, are they somehow higher in rank or superior to the great employees?

17:30.600 --> 17:33.300
Oh, no, it's just a different word that also means great.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
It sort of means better than great.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.600
Not around here, it doesn't.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.300
Okay.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.200
How are like teams chosen?

17:41.200 --> 17:47.600
Oh, well, when you get hired, you just kind of become either a great employee or an excellent employee.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.300
But do you like have a say in it?

17:49.300 --> 17:51.200
No, it's just kind of where you fit.

17:51.200 --> 17:55.000
Do different departments have different designations?

17:55.000 --> 17:59.300
Yeah, the excellent employees work in the lab and the great employees work in the factory.

17:59.300 --> 18:08.000
And she points to the lab when she says the lab and the lab is the glass and grass building behind the statues on the north side.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.700
And on the east side, just above some perfectly cylindrical trees,

18:12.700 --> 18:21.500
she points to the top of a massive greenhouse that is peeking out above these cake pop like trees.

18:21.500 --> 18:24.400
Jennifer, you told us earlier you were born here.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.300
Born and raised.

18:25.300 --> 18:28.000
Were your parents on teams as well?

18:28.000 --> 18:31.800
Yeah, my mom was a great employee and my dad was a great employee.

18:31.800 --> 18:37.000
Is it typical for the children of great employees to wind up on the same team as their parents or?

18:37.800 --> 18:40.000
Not always, but in my case, it worked out.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
Are you friends with any excellent employees?

18:44.000 --> 18:46.800
Not really. We, you know, kind of work in separate places.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.700
You know how I assume you guys all work together?

18:49.700 --> 18:52.400
Yes, in a small van.

18:52.400 --> 18:58.600
Well, then you're probably very close to your co-workers and less close to people you don't work directly with, right?

18:58.600 --> 19:01.000
No, I mean, not not like as a rule.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.600
Sometimes people you once worked closely with can stab you in the back.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.100
Oh, with what?

19:07.100 --> 19:08.600
Corporate politics.

19:08.600 --> 19:11.700
Wow, that sounds really hard and sad.

19:11.700 --> 19:13.800
Like your dad.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.400
Are you okay?

19:22.400 --> 19:24.400
Yes, yes, but we're not here to ask about me.

19:24.400 --> 19:25.400
I'm just fine.

19:25.400 --> 19:28.700
We want to know more about you, Jennifer, and what you do here.

19:28.700 --> 19:34.900
And as you're kind of looking to Julius, you see a man wearing well-fitted athleisure,

19:34.900 --> 19:42.500
monochromatic with green accents, approaches your group confidently with a hand outstretched.

19:42.500 --> 19:45.900
Well, hello there, you fine interlopers.

19:45.900 --> 19:49.900
What a coincidence indeed to run into you here.

19:49.900 --> 19:52.400
My name is Fox Godel.

19:52.400 --> 19:59.300
I am the son of my father, Fred Godel, the grandson of my grandfather, Frank Godel,

19:59.300 --> 20:02.900
and the future CEO of the Godel company.

20:02.900 --> 20:04.800
It's an absolute pleasure to meet you.

20:04.800 --> 20:09.300
Would Julius know, has he like seen Fox outside?

20:09.300 --> 20:11.000
Like does he go into the real world?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.400
Oh, great question.

20:12.400 --> 20:18.200
No, you would only know Fox Godel from some pictures that have been on like magazine covers

20:18.200 --> 20:22.800
where he's just like posing on a sound stage with his dad just within the past year.

20:22.800 --> 20:23.800
How old is he?

20:23.800 --> 20:24.800
Yeah.

20:24.800 --> 20:28.600
Fox Godel, he seems to be in his mid twenties.

20:28.600 --> 20:31.000
Oh, and Zach, last question.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.600
How can someone have a monochromatic outfit with colorful accents?

20:35.600 --> 20:36.800
Oh, well that's easy.

20:36.800 --> 20:43.000
It's just like white, gray, a few different shades of gray, black, and then has like green

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
accents on the side.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Not monochromatic.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Oh, fuck.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
It's pretty, it's pretty.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Gray scale.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Gray scale.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Okay.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Gray scale.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
Gray scale with green accents.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Monochromatic gray scale with green accents.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
He got it on the bio farm.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Mr. Godel, it is a pleasure to meet you.

21:06.000 --> 21:12.400
And he shakes your hand, but then when he goes to shake the hand of Mr. Beck Wilder,

21:12.400 --> 21:19.000
he looks up at you, notices the headphones on your head and immediately his eyes glaze

21:19.000 --> 21:24.120
over and he gets this horribly tortured look on his face.

21:24.120 --> 21:26.600
Was the last person that did that a farmer?

21:26.600 --> 21:27.600
Yeah.

21:27.600 --> 21:28.600
He was.

21:28.600 --> 21:29.600
Yeah.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.400
It was the lemon or just some other guy.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.400
It was.

21:32.400 --> 21:33.400
It was the ticket guy.

21:33.400 --> 21:34.400
Right.

21:34.400 --> 21:35.400
It was actually, it was Jesse Lemon.

21:35.400 --> 21:36.400
Okay.

21:36.400 --> 21:41.200
It was the farmer who sold his property to Fred Godel.

21:41.200 --> 21:45.300
Zach, can you remind me, did I know, did I figure out that that's what he was looking

21:45.300 --> 21:46.520
at at the farm?

21:46.520 --> 21:48.600
Did Beck know that it was his headphones?

21:48.600 --> 21:49.600
You'd even try it.

21:49.600 --> 21:50.600
You even took them off and stuff.

21:50.600 --> 21:51.600
Yeah.

21:51.600 --> 21:52.600
Yeah.

21:52.600 --> 21:55.920
I need everyone to real grip as the look of this man who was just completely normal

21:55.920 --> 22:03.800
a moment ago as clearly gone somewhere else inside of his own mind and is trapped seemingly

22:03.800 --> 22:05.920
with the disturbing.

22:05.920 --> 22:08.600
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind tonight.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.000
Yeah, I definitely do not pass.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
I crit fail.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Oh.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
Oh, I crit failed too, dude.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
99.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
It was an 88.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.400
Oh, I'm going to spend luck and the other luck you gave me.

22:21.400 --> 22:26.000
You can't spend luck because it would just be 99 to switch.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Oh, that's right.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Well, fuck.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
You just spent your luck.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
No, I made it 99.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
It was the luck.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
It was and it is.

22:37.400 --> 22:38.400
No, I made it 9.9.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.400
Oh.

22:39.400 --> 22:42.400
Julius, you are going to lose one grip.

22:42.400 --> 22:47.400
Beck Wilder, Cal Colorado, you're going to lose two grip each.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.400
Well, that's not so bad.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.400
Because we saw his face.

22:50.400 --> 22:54.400
And I think everybody recognized it was the same thing.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.400
It was the headphones that freaked him out.

22:56.400 --> 23:00.400
Yeah, that's what's freaking you out is that now you've run into a second person

23:00.400 --> 23:03.400
who has had the same reaction to your headphones.

23:03.800 --> 23:08.800
Okay, so but it's not like an intrinsic fear like I saw the face of pure evil terror.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.800
No, it's not pure evil terror.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.800
It's simply just...

23:12.800 --> 23:14.800
It's wrong for someone to be scared of a headphone.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.800
So afraid of headphones.

23:16.800 --> 23:19.800
And then not only that, but unnaturally with the snap of a finger.

23:19.800 --> 23:21.800
But there is no snap of any fingers.

23:21.800 --> 23:26.800
But if you were to, just he's right back to normal looking at you smiling,

23:26.800 --> 23:28.800
going in for a handshake.

23:28.800 --> 23:29.800
Nice.

23:29.800 --> 23:30.800
What the...

23:30.800 --> 23:31.800
What was that?

23:32.200 --> 23:36.200
I don't shake his hand because I've now critically failed this grip loss.

23:36.200 --> 23:37.200
I think that he...

23:37.200 --> 23:38.200
Awesome.

23:38.200 --> 23:39.200
What are you doing?

23:39.200 --> 23:40.200
If you fail grip, you can't shake his hand.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.200
That's the rules.

23:42.200 --> 23:43.200
And he kind of...

23:43.200 --> 23:45.200
You awkwardly grab too soon and grab his fingers.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.200
No, I don't even make a move.

23:47.200 --> 23:51.200
And I'm just kind of like startled kind of by how scared he was of me.

23:51.200 --> 23:55.200
And maybe I go up like, is there something on my neck?

23:55.200 --> 23:57.200
And then I feel the headphones.

23:57.200 --> 23:58.200
Oh, fuck.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.200
Who is this guy?

23:59.200 --> 24:00.200
What's going on here?

24:00.600 --> 24:02.600
You know, he pokes you in the belly a little bit.

24:02.600 --> 24:03.600
Uh, Julius, like...

24:03.600 --> 24:04.600
Like Tife.

24:04.600 --> 24:05.600
Definitely...

24:05.600 --> 24:06.600
Oh, shit.

24:06.600 --> 24:07.600
Yeah, like Tife.

24:07.600 --> 24:11.600
Is there somebody in your life who's not respecting your personal boundaries?

24:11.600 --> 24:15.600
Because poking people in the belly sucks.

24:15.600 --> 24:16.600
That's not a cool thing to do.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.600
I guess we just had a couple...

24:18.600 --> 24:19.600
Is Taylor...

24:19.600 --> 24:22.600
Real rude people on the NPCs so far.

24:22.600 --> 24:26.600
Julius is freaked out by that, but not like a crazy amount,

24:26.600 --> 24:29.600
but enough that he wants to like address that...

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
But I would like you to...

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Because you just failed, you didn't critical fail,

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
I'm going to let you roll an alertness check here.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
But again, because you did fail that check,

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
you're going to be at a negative 20.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Pass.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
A 32, which makes it a 52, on a 70.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Fantastic.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
If I could have Thomas and Joe remove their headphones in La La La,

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
but don't La La La, because you're in the same room.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
La La La!

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
So what happens?

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
So next, they can't hear,

24:58.400 --> 25:01.400
but the next thing that happens

25:01.400 --> 25:05.400
is that you actually, you notice that Stevie,

25:05.400 --> 25:09.400
her eyes are welling up with tears

25:09.400 --> 25:13.400
as she's staring into the face of Fox Gothel

25:13.400 --> 25:16.400
as he's having this strange experience.

25:16.400 --> 25:19.400
Like, do I recognize that it's from his...

25:19.400 --> 25:22.400
I mean, he's doing a real weird fucking thing here

25:22.400 --> 25:25.400
and her eyes weren't full of tears a second ago.

25:25.400 --> 25:26.400
Gotcha, okay.

25:26.800 --> 25:27.800
And then you're back.

25:27.800 --> 25:31.800
We all give him the bird.

25:31.800 --> 25:33.800
You know what we mean.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.800
Julius looks at Fox.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.800
What was that...

25:37.800 --> 25:38.800
Stevie?

25:38.800 --> 25:40.800
Oh, you're Stevie?

25:40.800 --> 25:41.800
It's nice to meet you.

25:41.800 --> 25:42.800
He puts out his hand and is like,

25:42.800 --> 25:43.800
Fox Gothel.

25:43.800 --> 25:44.800
And you.

25:44.800 --> 25:45.800
So what is your name?

25:45.800 --> 25:48.800
Why did you have that look on your face?

25:48.800 --> 25:51.800
What, this beautiful grin of mine?

25:51.800 --> 25:54.800
So sorry if it was too charming for you.

25:55.200 --> 25:58.200
I like point at Beck's headphones.

25:58.200 --> 26:01.200
Yeah, and when he looks back, he breaks again

26:01.200 --> 26:04.200
and he's just like making this really strange face.

26:04.200 --> 26:07.200
It's just pure terror is across

26:07.200 --> 26:10.200
and you can just see his lips quivering.

26:10.200 --> 26:13.200
His eyes are kind of like darting back and forth.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.200
He's not looking even at the headphones anymore

26:15.200 --> 26:18.200
and just as soon as you notice it, he's done.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.200
But because this just happened

26:20.200 --> 26:23.200
and you kind of have a bit of a grip on yourselves this time,

26:23.600 --> 26:24.600
the two of you,

26:24.600 --> 26:26.600
because you didn't roll alertness last time,

26:26.600 --> 26:28.600
you get to roll alertness this time,

26:28.600 --> 26:30.600
but because you critically failed last time,

26:30.600 --> 26:32.600
I'm going to put you at a negative 20.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.600
Real quick, we said Jesse Lemons did sell his farm, right?

26:34.600 --> 26:36.600
Jesse Lemon did sell his farm.

26:36.600 --> 26:37.600
Yes.

26:37.600 --> 26:39.600
I've got a theory, guys.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.600
Oh my God.

26:44.600 --> 26:45.600
I rolled a hundred.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.600
Oh my God.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.600
I rolled a one.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.600
Oh my God.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
What the hell is going on tonight?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Okay.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
First, we are going to do Thomas

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
because I don't know what to do with you.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
I saw your zeros.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
I was like, hell yeah, dude.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
So, fuck.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
Zach, can you take your headphones out and rub your ears?

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
I don't want to have to change shit if we get it right,

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
but I think people are getting Clockwork Orange here.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Like, God has some kind of device.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Headphones are a major part of it.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Yeah.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
So I'm sure he's done it to control his son.

27:20.400 --> 27:23.400
He did it to convince the farmers to sell to him.

27:23.400 --> 27:24.400
I like that idea.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.400
But it's in some way that they don't remember

27:26.400 --> 27:28.400
because they seem kind of aware of themselves.

27:28.400 --> 27:29.400
Yeah.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.400
Do they have to put ear drops in?

27:31.400 --> 27:33.400
Zach?

27:36.400 --> 27:38.400
Oh, that was scary.

27:38.400 --> 27:39.400
When you were rubbing your ears like that,

27:39.400 --> 27:41.400
did you feel like you were back at the big boy show?

27:41.400 --> 27:43.400
Oh, dude.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.400
Yeah, but my heart wasn't thumping

27:45.400 --> 27:48.400
to the point of actual anxiety.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.800
It was so fucking great.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.800
We were so close and so loud.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.800
Absolutely rattling my chest cavity.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.800
Yeah, like the way it does

27:56.800 --> 27:58.800
when you're fucking 10 years old and you get to go to a show.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.800
It was so cool.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.800
It was absurd.

28:02.800 --> 28:04.800
And we were so close to the front.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.800
It was fucking awesome.

28:06.800 --> 28:07.800
I had never felt this before,

28:07.800 --> 28:09.800
but when I would breathe in through my nose,

28:09.800 --> 28:11.800
I could feel it vibrating.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.800
It was so weird.

28:13.800 --> 28:15.800
So the story behind this is that I was sitting on my couch

28:16.200 --> 28:18.200
on Saturday and Luke calls me

28:18.200 --> 28:20.200
and says,

28:20.200 --> 28:22.200
He's like, hey, what are you doing right now?

28:22.200 --> 28:24.200
Well, you're about to edit the podcast.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.200
I was about to edit, yeah.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.200
I'm like, okay, you're going to Bentonville with us

28:28.200 --> 28:30.200
to see Big Boy and Run the Jewels.

28:30.200 --> 28:32.200
And then he said he'll be at my house in 10 minutes.

28:32.200 --> 28:34.200
So I hung up and changed clothes

28:34.200 --> 28:36.200
and then we drove to Bentonville

28:36.200 --> 28:38.200
and watched Run the Jewels and Big Boy.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.200
It was fucking sick as hell.

28:40.200 --> 28:42.200
It was incredible.

28:42.200 --> 28:44.200
That venue was pretty cool too.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.600
No, it sucked. Walmart sucks.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.600
Walmart does suck.

28:48.600 --> 28:50.600
The venue sucked. The whole thing sucks.

28:50.600 --> 28:52.600
The vans were great.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.600
Terrible art. Yeah, the art sucks.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.600
That coffee shop blows.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.600
Well, it's confusing.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.600
It is. There's seats that

29:00.600 --> 29:02.600
doesn't look like you're supposed to sit in.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.600
It's extremely confusing seating, Joe.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.600
It's so confusing.

29:06.600 --> 29:08.600
And what's also confusing

29:08.600 --> 29:10.600
is the look on Fox Gottel's face.

29:10.600 --> 29:12.600
Oh wait, but not to me

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Oh, that's right. Joe, if I could have

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
you and Luke take your headphones off here.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Thomas, you're going to see

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
a couple things here.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
First off, Stevie

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
is staring directly

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
into the face of Fox

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Gottel with just

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
this wild sadness.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Just this deep

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
struggling pain.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Her eyes are welling up with

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
tears. So much

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
so that the wall is about

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
to break, but

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
the dam stays and no

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
tear actually rolls down her face.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
How old is Stevie? Stevie looks

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
to be maybe in

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
her late 20s, early 30s.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Okay, what is the second thing I see?

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
The second thing isn't what you see.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
It's what you remember.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
You remember

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
yeah, this is Fox Gottel

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
but it's like a little piece

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
of trivia that you remember.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Probably from reading the news.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Or even saying it. Exactly.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Literally saying it on the news when

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Fred Gottel had his second

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
born child

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Greg.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
That's kind of washing over him

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
but he turns around and looks at

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Stevie and he mouths

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Faith?

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Her eyes

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
get fucking huge.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Fucking Gottem.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Gottel!

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Gottel!

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Sweet.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
The way that I was rubbing my fingers in my ear

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
most of the time it was

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
but my finger slipped once and I heard

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Thomas go MOUTH!

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
I bet he just said like mouth but because

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
you were rubbing, it was just like so

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
loud coming through. That's so great.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
I was doing it to the beat of

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
My House by Flo Rida.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
So I was going to say to add some character

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
flavor to it I was trying to think why would he fail

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
this alertness role and it's because

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
all Beck's life he's been

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
a goofball and

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
maybe the worst he's ever gotten

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
in response to that is disappointment

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
and maybe some disgust sometimes when he's

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
like a slob. To see

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
himself elicit like

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
carnal fear in somebody

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
he's like what the fuck?

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
There's something wrong with me all of a sudden.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
I'm broken. Right. Holy shit.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Which makes you trip backwards

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
squishing the

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
rabbit underneath your

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
feet and falling

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
directly on the

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
antlers impaling

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
your upper thigh.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Fuck dude. I guess that is

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
a fucking crit fail.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Holy shit. You lose four

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
hit points as you

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
start bleeding out.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Get a doctor. Mr. Gothel.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Get a doctor immediately.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Fuck.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
I don't actually

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
oh right a doctor

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
right. Damn it man.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Move. Thankfully someone else

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
comes up it's one of the people

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
in yellow athleisure

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
comes up and is like

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
oh my goodness do you need a doctor?

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Okay right away and they pull

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
out this device out of their

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
pocket and it looks like a futuristic

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
like Star Trek

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
speaker system it's actually

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
you know what it's um they're called

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
tricorders in Star Trek. Okay no I'm not

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
going to do that. Does it have like a big

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
talkie grill kind of thing? Yeah it's

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
got a big talkie grill on it it's like

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
a 60s like little oval

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
anthill thing with just a like a

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
wah wah wah wah. Yes exactly.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Like a CB radio thing. Yeah almost like a

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
CB radio and she grabs it and

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
and clicks in and is like doctor

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
I need a doctor to the south side

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
of the park immediately

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
immediately we're on the track yeah we're

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
on the track. Beck uh

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
just hang on there buddy. You all see

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Foxgoddle is walking away with

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
his hands in his pockets while whistling

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Fuck. What the fuck?

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Can I try to first aid him? Uh

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
yeah go for it. Pass. What are you

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
using to uh. The ribbon

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
from the ambush.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Yes okay uh yeah you're

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
actually easily able to

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
uh go ahead and stop the bleeding

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
here so Beck you're not going to bleed

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
out. Oh thank god. So you get this

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
rush of relief over

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000

what this does for him. Just one. Just one

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
get one hit point back

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
the most important thing is that the bleeding stops

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
oh well that's

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
that's certainly uh

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Fox immediately whips back around and is like

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
oh oh you happen to fix it

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
they see the headphones and their mouth

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000

um

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Stevie

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
are you the one who told us about

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
the pen yeah so like

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
I was gonna have you film the injury

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
is that still part of your job

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
or like yeah no I can absolutely

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
I can film the injury

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
that's okay yeah what are you

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
what's going on okay

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
it's not a big deal we're just gonna do this job

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
and then we're gonna get out of here we can talk about it when we get out of here okay

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Stevie so what do the

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
job what's the job finding the pen

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
no we have to film all of

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
this and then we have to get it out of here

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
we have to film the

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
dark side of what's out here

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
where's the dark stuff happen

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
and I look at the

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
lab inquisitively

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
laughter

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
laughter

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
honestly I didn't think that we'd be

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
having this conversation this early

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
but Zach's like

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
fuck there's just some really

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
fucked up shit okay do you trust me

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Beck looks to Cal

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Stevie you are the finest

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
gopher we've ever had

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
on this crew thank you can we

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
trust these people with our Beck

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
is he safe in their hands in their

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
medical care yeah he'll get the best

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
medical care available we'll

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
be allowed to go with him I bet well first of all

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
we will not be separated

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
from Beck sure yeah I don't

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
think that'll be a problem Beck is looking

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
really pale and he's

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
slurring even more than he usually does

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
cause there's a thin yellow like fucking

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
wrapping paper ribbon

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
laughter

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
laughter

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
this may be like the most

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
fortuitous of things because this

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
like it is into like their like

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
medical facilities and

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
once you're there it seems like you'd have access to

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
a lot of things like hospitals

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
are like centrally located in most

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
facilities yeah if they

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
let us out it'll be at the lab so

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
it'll be fine Stevie

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
were you born here yeah

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
when you yeah dude when did you

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
get out or were the Godel children

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
always allowed out no I got out like a

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
year ago my god that's

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
when I think when um

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
I think that's when Greg got got

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Beck is now thinking about

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
it to himself and then makes eye contact

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
with Stevie and then

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
wiggles his headphones at her

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
yeah

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
you can probably answer this

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
what's the deal with the food

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
on the train why can't any outside food

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
come in oh yeah that's why I got you guys

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
all amped up on caffeine before we

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
got in it's uh

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
you can't have any caffeine or drugs

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
in here all the stuff that they

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
have doesn't actually have caffeine in it

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
it's just like if you have caffeine

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
in your system you won't

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
be able to

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
get got

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
that's fucking dark

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Beck is gonna be bulletproof here he

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
drank like 40 of these

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
so the people

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
here are all under some kind of control

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
yeah and that's what we're trying

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
to show I'm assuming it's some kind of

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
you've fucking seen it you've all seen it

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
kind of headphone device no

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
it's just and then Fox walks up and he's like

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
hey what are you guys talking about

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
I punch him in the face

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
headphones headphones headphones headphones

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
headphone attack headphone attack

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
actually yeah literally I just

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
oh my god

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
I just lift one of Beck's

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
earphones like away from his ear

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
and let it fall back and like point at it

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
when he comes to you guys are like walking

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
and we're whistling

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
at this point

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Fox comes up and he's

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
kind of talking to you guys and you see

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
that the medical staff has

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
arrived and they came on

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
a bowl pen cart

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
yeah dude hell yeah

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
with the helmet

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
are they wearing green

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
yeah they're all wearing green

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
of course they are they get

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Beck situated on this

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
on this stretcher kind of situation

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
comfortably sitting and

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
they begin walking everyone

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
kind of down the trail

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
along the west

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
walkway up toward the lab

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
toward the north side alright well

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
do any of you want to come see

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
my GIZ

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
your GIZ?

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
yes let's go see my GIZ

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
I'm very proud of it I think we'd have a good time

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
you don't want to stick around and deal with all this

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
medical nonsense and

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
sit in a waiting room or what have you

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
you should come check out my GIZ I've got games

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
I've got a pool I've got a hot tub

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
whatever you want we could watch a movie we could hang out

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
mr. Godel I assure you

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
can never leaves a man

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
behind alright well

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
what is your GIZ?

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
my Godel innovation zone

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
yes of course my GIZ

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
yes of course the best

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
thoughts come in your GIZ

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
is that where you came up with the bouncy walkways?

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
well of course yes

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
I can take credit for that I believe I

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
dreamt it as a child and made a

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
drawing that my father made a reality

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
that's rad

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
could we take a rain check on

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
seeing your GIZ?

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
we are gonna

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
stay with our colleague

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
alright I'll take the I'll take the old rain check

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
if you're gonna be nice about it I don't

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
much care for that one and he points at Cal

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
he's like you had a nice handshake too

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
but you're a bit of a dick

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
sir you have ignored

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
the medical emergency of our co-worker

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
you tried to

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
refuse a medical service

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
and now you seem to want to

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
separate us from our friend

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
now I assure you I could be very nice to you

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
and very beneficial

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
for your business if we

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
perhaps get the message you want

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
on the air but you have

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
to talk to us first why don't you come

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
along with us dude I can like totally

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
film the interview from the bed

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
I would like to be on camera

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
okay you got me there

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
and he continues walking alongside

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
of each of you

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
looks over at Beck and Cal

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
you're also very handsome

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
I deeply appreciate that

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
of course I do

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
wow Julius

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
very kind

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
very kind indeed

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
I was trying to just

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
write quickly down what has happened so far

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
and one of my favorite things I think I've ever

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
written in my notes is I fell on a

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
jackalope

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
it's not at all

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
what I expected to happen tonight

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
I fell on a jackalope

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
and we passed up a chance to see jizz

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Beck fell on

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
a jackalope is honestly someday

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
how I expect to hear that actual

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Beck died

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
holy shit

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
where do Scientologists go when they die

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
hell

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
on the way there you guys all see a woman

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
who is kind of turning the corner

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
she's coming from the lab

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
statue area right

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
turning the corner heading down the walkway

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
toward you and you see that she is

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
a pencil of a woman

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
with bouncy spiky

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
hair on top of her head

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Mr. Gotl you have pencil people here

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
roll grip

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
yeah

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
literally imagining that's my number two

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
just about to say

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
I'm imagining a number two like

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
bouncing down the road

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
fresh shape

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
this total beaker of a woman

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
is just like

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
notices you all and then

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
bounces away

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
yeah just gonna

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
running though

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
back from whence she came

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
so wait wait

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
did she just come towards us and turn around

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
yep she came out

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
turned the corner saw you guys

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
immediately started running in the

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
opposite direction and

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Fox is like oh Barbara

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
off to go run

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
and see her old husband

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
probably freaking out that he didn't

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
meet you guys at the gate huh

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
who is that

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
oh Chuck Bidwell

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Chuck Bidwell and Barbara Bidwell

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Chuck is our well he's not the mayor

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
but he's

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
no no of course not

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
I'm not the mayor but you know

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Chuck is the guy who kind of

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
does everything that the mayor should do

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
yeah like a city manager

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
yeah kind of like that yeah

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
and you're saying he should have met us at the gate

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
well I would assume that that's why

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Barbara was running off like that

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
she's kind of his keeper

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
I suppose

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Cal glances back to make sure

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
he's been rolling this whole time

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Mr. Gottle

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
what would a city manager handle here

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
do they handle taxes

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
well yes of course I would assume

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
yeah they would handle all sorts of business

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
sides of things but of course

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
taxes because of course you

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
pay these employees

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
well obviously we have to

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
pay our employees in

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
money? uh yeah

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
US dollars

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
or points which one would you

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
like to hear I actually

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
I'm a bit of

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
afraid to say I don't know the answer

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
to that question I am a bit

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
more of the hang out in my

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
GIZ and kick it kind of guy

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
so to your knowledge sir you

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
do not pay your employees anything

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
well I wouldn't be the one paying him now

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
would I I'm the future CEO

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
of the Gottle company but not the

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
current CEO as he points up at the statues

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
ahead he says see uh

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
not a statue up there yet but

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
sir how much does a gallon of milk cost

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
commissioning it

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
a gallon of milk

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
god I don't know um

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
pffff

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
seven

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
seven

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
seven dollars

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
dammit he's right

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
is everyone here

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
vegan or vegetarian

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
well no one eats meat or meat

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
byproducts uh I

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
guess that's what you might call vegan yeah

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
pretty rough move when he came in there

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Beck stepping

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
on an animal like that that's uh

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
not a way to make a good impression around here

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
this rings true for

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Beck he's kind of feeling bad that he

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
fell on a jackalope

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
was the rabbit okay

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
I didn't even check sure

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Beck yeah cool

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
it wasn't oh

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
I think he killed it it was at least

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
a swift end

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
I saw it cry

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
I've never like

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
killed an animal before

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
and at this point you guys have kind of made your way up

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
to the front here and it's a sight

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
to behold this is a massive

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
glass building

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
three stories tall

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
but extremely wide

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
taking up the whole north side of this

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
park square and

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
in front of it massive

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
26.3

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
meter tall statues

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
of this green rock

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
and up close you see

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
an immense amount of detail

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
hey Zach would that happen to be 69 feet

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
no

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
it does seem like

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
I literally just did the math in my head at 78.9

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
but I

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
did the math because I was like that's probably

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
69

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
we covered a lot

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
we got a lot of fantastic

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
footage of

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Godel just being just incriminating

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
himself really

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
oh are you still filming from the

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
I never

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
got the camera hand off to

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Stevie

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
but I think that made it more

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
a little more discreet

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
it's all like the cover of

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Rubber Soul where it's all kind of looking up

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
at everybody's faces and just swiveling

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
it's a really rad dolly shot there

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
it's a walk and talk

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
yeah it's a total walk and talk

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
down low angle

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Joe loves his sorkin

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
you know it

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
fuck

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
and as you guys are walking down at the very end

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
you see a

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
maybe not yet

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
pterodactyl

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
another jackalope

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
oh god

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
it's gonna haunt me for the rest of my life

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
this one has a

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
purple ribbon

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
never mind it's not the same one

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Cal leans over at his TV

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
hey what

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
there's purple

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
is there a purple team?

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Fox you notice kind of runs over

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
to it removes the ribbon

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
puts the ribbon in his pocket

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
and then starts walking away

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
from you all back

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
toward where you came from

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
kind of toward where you

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
he's kind of pointed at his house

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
he's just kind of walking away

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
whistling with his hands in his pockets

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
once again

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Mr. Godle, Mr. Godle

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Fox

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
I throw some headphones at him

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
roll athletics

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
to see if you can throw

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
at a negative 20

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
to see if you can throw a pair of headphones

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
and I assume you grab

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
I've got a 10% chance

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
you grab Bex

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
98

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
so you grab Bex

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
headphones from off his head

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
and you throw them without

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
unplugging them from the cord at all

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
and they just kind of immediately

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
swing into the ground

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
and

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Fox turns around as he's whistling

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
and is kind of like you guys

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
and he's not looking he's just

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
yelling over his shoulder you said

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
you wouldn't leave your friend right?

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
bye it was nice to meet you

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
continues kind of whistling

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Mr. Godle wait where are we supposed to go?

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
and one of the people walking

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
with you is like

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
oh we'll take care of it

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
and then they notice the headphones on the ground

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
and they're like

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
we just like look at our watches

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
and tap our feet

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Bex calls after Fox also

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
no interview then or

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
and with that he's gone

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
you guys are now walking past

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
where there's this rabbit

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
just kind of hopping along

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
with a spare pair of antlers

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
hanging out on the ground

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
I'm sorry about your brother my man

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
yeah

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
not Stevie the rabbit

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
oh yeah I was talking to the rabbit

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
I thought you were talking

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
back at the rabbit

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
she was about to be like shut the fuck up

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
straight up

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
straight up was like dude the rabbits talk right

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
oh my god

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
they're not real jackalopes but they do talk

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
and can love

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
we'll travel

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
we hear the other one just screaming

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
kill me!

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
oh god

51:23.000 --> 51:27.000
I'm not quite dead yet!

51:27.000 --> 51:31.000
cow's like

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
oh jeez what's up doc

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
yes

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
that means you wear green

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
am I right?

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
yeah EE's excellent employees

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
between you and me

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
between Kyle Colorado and two EE's

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
do you feel like you're better than the great employees?

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
yeah I mean

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
it's different

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
tell me are you from around here?

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
yeah I live over there and

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
they point at one of these dope houses

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
inside this futuristic

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
mid century modern house

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
that wouldn't happen to be the home you were born in would it?

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
no I'm from like the outside

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
how long have you been in Grover's Gorge?

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
gosh like five years?

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
and do they pay you?

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
in money? yeah

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
what's your salary? if you don't mind me asking

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
what's your salary?

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
a million dollars

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
it was once close

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
and you're walking up the stairs

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
kind of now and this

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
oh like the golf carts

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
is that what you called it? I called it a bullpen cart

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
are we in a

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
we've been in that the whole time

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
yeah you've been walking him down

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
yeah you've been walking him down to the end

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
standing next to me

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
it does a nice little

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
slide into stairs

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
where it's got kind of rails that land

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
down on the stairs to where it can slide

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
gently up the stairs and you're walking

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
up the stairs and

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
all of the stairs that you're walking

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
on are grass

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
grass stairs leading up

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
and then this like small grass field

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
in front of this beautiful

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
glass building and on this grass

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
area is where these two I mean you're looking

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
up they're huge

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
the hogs? they're like

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
well I mean

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
how many feet did you say Luke? 78.9

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
yeah that's like seven stories tall

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
real quick these things are tall

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
the grass stairs

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
where people have traveled

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
up them or is the grass worn away

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
or is it like perfect grass?

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
oh it's like perfect grass

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
no desire paths or like dirt

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
not at all and you see a woman who is walking

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
out of the lab

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
currently in full

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
judges robes and a powdered

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
wig atop her head

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
hey that's from the thing

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
oh yeah

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
she's wearing a

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
pair of electric blue high

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
heels no green or yellow

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
markings anywhere? no green or yellow markings

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
anywhere no no she looks

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
like a real world judge and

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
no gaudel corporation trappings

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
absolutely not other than

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
perhaps the powdered wig might

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
make her not so much

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
look like a real world judge or like

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
I'm sorry British yeah are you aware of

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
the commonwealth nations? I'm not

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
no can you please they dress like fucking

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
idiots yeah they look like buffoons

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
and those fucking buffoons

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
send you away to prison

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
I think they make

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
the lawyers wear them too straight up this is

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
what they look like oh my

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
god did you not know they still did that?

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
no that's silly

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
I like that yeah

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
so exactly like real world judges

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
oh my god these guys look so

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
silly as she's walking

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
out I need everyone to roll humans

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
please I'm sorry she's walking out

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
of the factory the lab

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
the lab pass ooh

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
hard pass with the three

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
I failed a

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
79 yeah you're

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
fucking screaming in the back

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
it makes a ton of sense that you

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
wouldn't pick up on this sir who a judge

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
surprised I didn't have you rolling a negative

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
we're like wait

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Beck Beck who's do you know that lady

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
and you're just like ahhhh

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
the

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
adrenaline has started to wear off a little bit

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
I'm going in and out of consciousness sometimes

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
you look back and my eyes are closed

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
so I passed my ass off

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
who is this judge?

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
both you and Julius notice that

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
the eyes of this judge

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
and Stevie

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
meet

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
like physically touch

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
laughter

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
as she passes

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
she leans in

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
and touches her eyeballs

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
they butterfly kiss

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
could you touch your eye

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
to somebody else's eye couldn't you?

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
yeah you can it's not

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
pleasant probably hurt

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
feels weird we'll try it later

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
I have contacts in then yeah it's protected

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
so you guys see this judge and she is

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
making eyes right they lock and

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
you notice a

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
strange look

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
come over the judge's face but

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
because you know who Stevie

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
is you see

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
a look of recognition

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
on the judge's face as she looks at

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Faith Godel Stevie is

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
that judge going to blow your cover

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
no I don't think so

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
she knew where I was

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
she's been keeping me safe this whole time so I don't think

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
she'd fuck it up now and then who does

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
she work for? the Godel Company

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
what is your relationship to her?

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
she's

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
nice

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
she's understanding at least

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
maybe not nice

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
she serves as some kind of

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
definitely not nice actually now that I think about it

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
she serves as a judge for this community

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
yeah and at this point

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
you guys are walking through

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
these glass walls

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
there's seemingly no

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
door but the walls

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
kind of lift

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
creating an opening in the whole

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
front of this building and allow

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
you to walk through Cal says

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
neat you continue to walk

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
on grass inside

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
that's fucking sick there are no

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
stairs but suddenly there's an

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
incline of the same synthetic pathway

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
that you saw out on the track

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
and that incline synthetic

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
pathway takes you upstairs

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
so basically you walk up

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
and then you flip a yay

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
and you're facing back the way you came

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
and there's another huge wall

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
of glass that you're looking out and

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
up against that glass there are three

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
stools with this glass backdrop

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
and it faces back the way you came

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
looking out through the glass wall

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
into the beauty

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
and enormity of the park at

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
the city center of Grover's Gorge

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
and on the far stool

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
perched on its

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
plastron which is the belly

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
of a turtle

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
is an extremely old looking

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
common box turtle

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
its head flippers and shell

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
are covered in scratches

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
and scars

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
and it looks damp

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
a makeup artist is attempting to powder

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
it dry while holding

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
the turtle steady by its

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
torn up moist shell

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Cal reaches a hand out to the

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
turtle and says, Mr. Gotle

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
I presume

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
the makeup artist is like laughing

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
this is just like a normal

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
sized box turtle or is it like big

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
yeah, how big is a box turtle

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
normally, pretty small, yeah so it's like a

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
big box turtle, okay

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
for everybody at home he was putting his hands

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
about this far apart, like the size of my head

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
not that big

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
yeah dude

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
that would be terrifying, how long

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
do box turtles live, oh forever

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
like a lobsters, and god

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
god was

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
never born though, neither were box

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
turtles, whoa

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
box turtles

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
yeah, you're right, box turtles

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
are not born, and do not

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
die

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
box turtles are angels

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
of our lord

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
and says they're right on the

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
wikipedia, dude

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
in the bible, box turtles actually look

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
fucking insane

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
you know, like a big wheel with eyeballs

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
god dammit, biblically accurate

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
turtle

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
its shells instead of eyes

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
box turtles generally

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
live to be about 35 years old

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
but some have been known to survive

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
for um, eternity

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
yeah, that's

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
what I thought, I say all this to the turtle

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
so we were led up here by this

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
medical staff? I thought maybe this was like a

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
waiting room, but then the turtle was

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
getting its makeup then

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
I thought they were

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
maybe disrespecting us very hard

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
yeah, like, we brought you to the

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
vet, you fucking

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
or just like, oh you want to interview somebody?

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
you want to interview, here's our employee of the month

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
boxy

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
one of the medical staff says to you

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
well I think you'll be doing

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
the interview up here and we can just have

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
the medical staff come up and meet you

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
they're based in this building, so

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
oh wait, the interview with mr

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
the mayor

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
oh, with the mayor, mr bidwell

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
no, the mayor

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
and they look at the turtle and they say

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
sandro

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
woah

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
I

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
hey Beck, don't step on the mayor

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
laughter

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
my life

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
is great

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
wait, Mickey Rooney Jr., Buzz Aldrin

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
and Neil Armstrong? and Ryan Gosling

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I was saying my movie is The First Mouseketeer

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
which is about

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Mickey Rooney Jr.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
it's like the fly

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
but instead of a fly, it's a mouse

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
ew

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
ew

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
that seems like a movie they should have tried to remake by now

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
I wouldn't want to live in a Cronenberg

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
have you ever seen the first, like the original

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
the old, old one? no, I haven't seen it

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
it's not very good

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
the one with Jeff Goldblum

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
you know that really old one

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
let's see, the fly remake

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
there's no plans that I can see

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
but there's an article that says

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
the fly continues to make a strong

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
pro remake argument

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
I, oh sorry

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
can I get 30 seconds to sound?

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
and it's all my fault

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
oh
