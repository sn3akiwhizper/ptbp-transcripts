WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.200
my closest comrades.

00:02.200 --> 00:05.100
Some of you may have noticed a strange occurrence

00:05.100 --> 00:06.920
in the past couple weeks.

00:06.920 --> 00:10.960
I, Wolf the Dog, your fearless leader,

00:10.960 --> 00:13.640
have been held against my will for a time.

00:13.640 --> 00:16.340
But I have escaped the torturous restraints

00:16.340 --> 00:19.820
of Judge Ephraim Cortland's sloppy meat trees

00:19.820 --> 00:20.920
he calls hands.

00:20.920 --> 00:24.360
And I am now back triumphantly crawling

00:24.360 --> 00:27.000
once again into your ear holes.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.080
Here on 694.2 PTBP,

00:31.080 --> 00:35.520
contention's oldest and only radio station.

00:35.520 --> 00:39.240
Now that the true wolf is on the bone throne once again,

00:39.240 --> 00:42.600
I think it's about damn time for some truth.

00:42.600 --> 00:44.440
Fuck every billionaire.

00:44.440 --> 00:47.080
Greed should only exist in the dumpster.

00:47.080 --> 00:51.800
Mm, what's wet, stinky, and made for sharing?

00:51.800 --> 00:53.960
It's the news.

00:53.960 --> 00:57.600
No shit, that disgusting excuse of a human,

00:57.600 --> 01:00.880
contention's so-called Judge Ephraim Cortland,

01:00.880 --> 01:03.040
was keeping me locked up in a cell.

01:03.040 --> 01:06.000
I'm deeply sorry to leave you so unsatisfied

01:06.000 --> 01:07.880
for so long, my pups.

01:07.880 --> 01:11.840
I promise to never get caught in a slop trap ever again.

01:11.840 --> 01:15.080
Trapped me with slop bait once, shame on you.

01:15.080 --> 01:18.520
Trapped me with slop bait twice, shame on you.

01:18.520 --> 01:20.080
Trapped me with slop bait three times,

01:20.080 --> 01:21.920
what the fuck is wrong with you?

01:21.920 --> 01:23.760
It's clear I can't help myself.

01:23.760 --> 01:26.400
And your crew would just take an advantage of that?

01:26.400 --> 01:27.760
Jesus.

01:27.760 --> 01:31.080
Anyway, maybe we should burn down the courthouse.

01:31.080 --> 01:34.240
Silas Cole can host any trials or legal matters

01:34.240 --> 01:36.160
out on his property by the mine.

01:36.160 --> 01:38.840
And he may as well preside over them too.

01:38.840 --> 01:41.920
He is, after all, the reason contention

01:41.920 --> 01:44.480
is so very prosperous.

01:44.480 --> 01:47.000
Slap your knee to the beat if you agree.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.080
It's the Creek Rocks with

01:49.080 --> 01:51.480
Can't You Hear the Wolves Are Howlin'?

01:51.480 --> 01:55.600
["Can't You Hear the Wolves Are Howlin'?" plays in bright rhythm.]

02:21.480 --> 02:24.480
["Can't You Hear the Wolves Are Howlin'?" plays in bright rhythm.]

02:51.840 --> 02:54.920
Do you guys know where the word howdy comes from?

02:54.920 --> 02:55.680
No.

02:55.680 --> 02:56.520
No.

02:56.520 --> 02:57.480
How do you do?

02:57.480 --> 02:58.320
Yeah.

02:58.320 --> 02:59.560
How do you do?

02:59.560 --> 03:00.960
How did I not know that?

03:00.960 --> 03:02.080
Howdy.

03:02.080 --> 03:05.720
They shortened how do you do down to how do ye.

03:05.720 --> 03:06.560
Howdy.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.360
Which then became howdy.

03:08.360 --> 03:09.200
Howdy.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.080
Howdy.

03:10.080 --> 03:12.400
How did I not know that?

03:12.400 --> 03:13.240
Hey.

03:13.240 --> 03:14.480
Ooh.

03:14.480 --> 03:15.480
Got it.

03:15.480 --> 03:17.440
I've got something that good for you here.

03:17.440 --> 03:22.480
Why did the cowboy take hay to bed

03:22.480 --> 03:24.840
to feed his nightmares?

03:24.840 --> 03:26.080
Oh my God.

03:26.080 --> 03:26.920
Mm.

03:26.920 --> 03:27.760
Mm-hmm.

03:27.760 --> 03:28.600
Mm-hmm.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.720
Mm-hmm.

03:29.720 --> 03:30.800
Got any others?

03:30.800 --> 03:32.160
Yeah, you got any other good ones?

03:32.160 --> 03:33.000
No, no more good.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.440
No, no good ones, but I've got another one.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.280
What did you Google?

03:36.280 --> 03:38.680
It looks like he's really enjoying it.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.800
I'm Googling cowboy jokes.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.800
Am I frozen or something?

03:42.800 --> 03:45.720
Yeah, you're frozen, but you're doing a cute little smile.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.240
It's a very cute smile.

03:47.240 --> 03:48.080
A hand behind the head.

03:48.080 --> 03:48.920
Oh, another cute smile.

03:48.920 --> 03:50.680
Very mischievous, Luke.

03:50.680 --> 03:54.720
Oh my God, that one's even better.

03:54.720 --> 03:58.680
What do you call a happy cowboy?

03:58.680 --> 04:01.160
A jolly rancher.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.000
Oh.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.600
Got it.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.360
Luke, have you delivered this joke before?

04:06.360 --> 04:08.720
No, but I just was trying to think.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.680
Luke's been sending him these all week.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.880
Okay, my internet seems to be fucking up,

04:15.880 --> 04:20.360
so let me try, okay, my hotspot is on,

04:20.360 --> 04:25.360
but it's not showing up in my, oh, here we go.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.320
Okay, I probably will disconnect for a second.

04:27.320 --> 04:28.160
Bye.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.000
Goodbye.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.960
Quick, let's make all our Luke jokes right now.

04:30.960 --> 04:31.920
Am I still here?

04:31.920 --> 04:32.760
Fuck.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.000
Okay, that worked.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
You could have kicked Luke

04:39.000 --> 04:41.800
and we could have had an all out Luke roast.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.400
It's not a roast unless I'm here.

04:43.400 --> 04:44.800
Yeah, you're yeah.

04:44.800 --> 04:45.720
Yeah, you're yeah.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.360
Did you see that Alec Baldwin roast

04:48.360 --> 04:50.880
with like his daughter was doing it?

04:50.880 --> 04:52.240
Yeah.

04:52.240 --> 04:54.680
Yeah, pretty bad.

04:54.680 --> 04:57.040
Yeah, it hit pretty hard.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.160
That way Alec Baldwin got roasted by his daughter.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.040
Yeah, like at a roast thing and the opening.

05:01.040 --> 05:02.840
Oh my God, Luke's frozen in the exact same.

05:02.840 --> 05:05.200
It's in spotting, it was just the smile.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.360
That's insane.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.240
Fuck.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.080
Can you hear me?

05:10.080 --> 05:10.920
Screenshot.

05:11.760 --> 05:16.240
It's so cute.

05:16.240 --> 05:17.200
What a cutie.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.680
I hope he looks like that forever.

05:18.680 --> 05:20.680
He will, have you seen his fucking dad?

05:20.680 --> 05:22.480
Oh, that's so true.

05:24.480 --> 05:28.040
Well, Efron fell off his damn old horse,

05:28.040 --> 05:31.080
broke his big ass spine in twain.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.240
I fucking wish.

05:32.240 --> 05:33.560
Everett crawled inside him.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.320
Oh, okay, let's go.

05:35.320 --> 05:36.680
Okay, am I good?

05:36.680 --> 05:37.680
You seem good.

05:37.680 --> 05:38.520
Okay.

05:38.520 --> 05:39.520
Yeah.

05:39.520 --> 05:41.440
Can you put your arm behind your head

05:41.440 --> 05:43.040
and smile for us really quick?

05:46.920 --> 05:50.360
Silas Cole is on his knees with his hands behind his back

05:50.360 --> 05:54.000
shackled by preacher-sheriff Dr. Bobby Custard

05:54.000 --> 05:58.120
with Judge Ephraim Cortland standing right behind him,

05:58.120 --> 06:00.480
right next to the preacher-sheriff doctor

06:00.480 --> 06:04.840
watching as Jack Perlman, Professor Horace Green

06:04.840 --> 06:08.720
and Everett Pace loaded the rug out of the back

06:08.760 --> 06:13.760
of Silas Cole's wagon and then slowly unfurled the rug

06:14.520 --> 06:18.040
after seeing shoes on one side and Everett, I believe,

06:18.040 --> 06:22.120
reached in to the other side and felt some patchy hair,

06:22.120 --> 06:24.800
a very thin-skinned scalp,

06:24.800 --> 06:27.160
almost touching the skull right off the bat.

06:28.080 --> 06:32.240
And as soon as the rug is completely unfurled,

06:32.240 --> 06:36.680
hopping onto all four haunches, haunches?

06:39.360 --> 06:40.680
Haunches.

06:40.680 --> 06:43.120
You're on your own with this one.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.920
Haunches.

06:44.920 --> 06:48.040
Haunches are like, would be with your legs, right?

06:48.040 --> 06:51.240
Hopping onto her back two haunches

06:51.240 --> 06:53.800
with her human arms in front of her.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.240
Are they touching the ground, the front arms?

06:59.200 --> 07:02.920
No, she's in a two and a half point stance.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.040
Velociraptor.

07:04.040 --> 07:08.720
Which means she's got like one arm kind of halfway down.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.640
The other one's on a knee, elbow on a knee.

07:11.640 --> 07:15.480
You notice there are no fingernails on her hands

07:15.480 --> 07:17.920
that are moving back and forth quickly

07:17.920 --> 07:19.840
with these wild eyes.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.320
She just slits right under them

07:22.320 --> 07:24.520
from where her cheekbones are poking through

07:24.520 --> 07:28.040
the thin skin on her face, blood dripping down

07:28.040 --> 07:32.400
and she lets out a guttural scream.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.680
Run, run, run, run.

07:35.760 --> 07:38.760
And then we're gonna go ahead and roll

07:38.760 --> 07:40.640
to see who she attacks.

07:40.640 --> 07:41.960
Oh boy.

07:41.960 --> 07:45.560
If it's a one or a two, she's gonna attack Jack Perlman.

07:45.560 --> 07:46.400
No.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.520
If it's a two or a three, she's gonna attack,

07:48.520 --> 07:51.520
oh, three or four, she's gonna attack Everett Pace.

07:51.520 --> 07:52.360
No.

07:52.360 --> 07:55.520
Five or six, it's gonna be Professor Horse Green.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.160
Hey Luke, can you roll a D6 for me

07:58.160 --> 07:59.400
and tell me what you get?

08:00.800 --> 08:01.640
Six.

08:01.720 --> 08:03.760
Oh, that's gonna be Professor Horse Green

08:03.760 --> 08:06.040
that she jumps directly toward.

08:06.040 --> 08:07.920
You made him your executioner.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.320
Hey Luke, do you wanna hurt one of your friends?

08:13.720 --> 08:14.560
Sorry.

08:15.760 --> 08:19.680
What does Professor Horse Green do as this human

08:19.680 --> 08:24.680
wearing these unfathomably out of fashion clothes

08:25.760 --> 08:30.760
with thin skin, open mouth, tongue waggling about,

08:31.120 --> 08:33.240
jumping at you, arms first,

08:33.240 --> 08:36.920
these fingernail-less hands going to grip

08:36.920 --> 08:39.760
onto either side of your shoulders.

08:45.360 --> 08:48.280
He shoots at her with his pistol.

08:49.440 --> 08:50.280
And gets a,

08:51.520 --> 08:53.160
And gets a what?

08:53.160 --> 08:54.680
A hundred.

08:54.680 --> 08:55.520
Oh no.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.160
Oh my God.

08:59.160 --> 09:00.000
What?

09:01.080 --> 09:01.920
What?

09:03.520 --> 09:05.240
Holy shit.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.080
You nailed it.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.800
Oh no.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.720
What are the chances of that?

09:15.520 --> 09:17.200
Holy shit.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.960
Professor Horse Green, your sidearm

09:19.960 --> 09:23.000
is still in the holster when you reach down to grab it,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.800
pull it out, and you flick the trigger

09:25.800 --> 09:27.120
right there on your holster.

09:27.120 --> 09:28.480
Go ahead and roll damage.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.120
What's the damage on that pistol?

09:31.760 --> 09:32.600
Ah.

09:33.640 --> 09:36.240
That's one D10 plus two.

09:36.240 --> 09:37.640
Holy shit.

09:39.240 --> 09:40.080
Nice.

09:42.120 --> 09:42.960
Six.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.400
Professor Horse Green,

09:45.600 --> 09:49.160
your kneecap goes right into the dirt.

09:49.160 --> 09:53.120
Bone shards from your knee are now sticking up

09:53.120 --> 09:57.480
out of the dirt as blood just begins spurting

09:57.520 --> 10:01.400
a fountain of blood away from your leg

10:01.400 --> 10:05.680
out onto this dusty ground beneath you.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.640
How many hit points did you have total?

10:09.400 --> 10:11.760
I was at 11.

10:11.760 --> 10:14.400
Yeah, so I'm going to need a constitution check there

10:14.400 --> 10:16.800
to stay conscious, buddy.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.000
Got a 50.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.080
And I roll an 85.

10:21.080 --> 10:25.240
Horse Green instantly collapses unconscious

10:25.240 --> 10:26.800
as he bleeds out on the ground.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.040
Oh shit.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.040
Damn.

10:29.040 --> 10:30.000
Holy shit.

10:36.000 --> 10:36.840
What?

10:41.280 --> 10:43.800
I might get to play video games a little bit earlier

10:43.800 --> 10:45.000
than I thought tonight.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.200
Oh my God.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.000
He's been practicing with Red Dead,

10:52.000 --> 10:56.040
but only using the bow and arrow.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.160
Judge F from Courtland, it is your turn.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.080
What do you do?

10:59.080 --> 11:02.280
From what I'm seeing, I'm busy with Silas

11:02.280 --> 11:05.520
and I just hear a scream and I turn around

11:05.520 --> 11:08.600
and I see her like hunched over.

11:09.760 --> 11:12.640
So I'm like within an arm's reach of my horse.

11:12.640 --> 11:15.320
So I grabbed my lasso off the horse

11:15.320 --> 11:17.280
and try to get her with the lasso,

11:17.280 --> 11:21.320
like around her arms and try to demobilize her.

11:21.320 --> 11:22.720
Roll rope use for me.

11:22.720 --> 11:23.560
Okay.

11:24.560 --> 11:27.080
That is a 85 on a 40.

11:27.080 --> 11:27.920
Oof.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.720
Oh no.

11:31.720 --> 11:34.280
Well, this isn't going great so far.

11:34.280 --> 11:35.840
Oh shit, my internet just went out.

11:35.840 --> 11:38.360
Fuck, I wasn't recording either.

11:38.360 --> 11:39.320
Damn it.

11:39.320 --> 11:40.160
Oops.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.600
Yeah, we're gonna have to do it again.

11:41.600 --> 11:45.600
Yeah, we're gonna have to do all live from the get go.

11:45.600 --> 11:49.240
So as I hear the scream, I turn around,

11:49.240 --> 11:53.280
grab the lasso and throw the lasso,

11:53.880 --> 11:58.120
but I had forgotten to tie the rope into a lasso.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.520
So I just threw the end of a rope at her.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.720
So the end of a rope hits her in the shoulder

12:03.720 --> 12:06.640
and it's a heavy rope and she grabs on

12:06.640 --> 12:08.160
to the other end of the rope.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.800
Preacher Sheriff Bobby Custard.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.040
Oh no.

12:19.480 --> 12:21.280
Freezes in terror.

12:23.320 --> 12:25.640
Just failed a sanity check.

12:25.640 --> 12:29.040
A sanity check that I forgot to have all of you roll,

12:29.040 --> 12:32.080
which you'll need to roll now.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.400
I'm not conscious, baby.

12:33.400 --> 12:36.440
You are unconscious, so you are good.

12:36.440 --> 12:38.000
Oh, I rolled a crit fail.

12:39.800 --> 12:40.640
Oh my God.

12:40.640 --> 12:41.480
Did you really?

12:41.480 --> 12:42.600
Welcome to the party, baby.

12:42.600 --> 12:43.960
I rolled a 99.

12:43.960 --> 12:46.120
Ooh, I got a 33 on a 50.

12:46.120 --> 12:47.200
Crit success.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.040
There you go.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.360
Okay, I got a normal success.

12:49.360 --> 12:50.960
And bringing the luck back up to our side.

12:50.960 --> 12:51.800
Oh my God.

12:51.880 --> 12:54.840
God damn these beautiful dice that Joe gave me.

12:56.520 --> 12:59.480
Okay, Everett Pace, you lose no sanity.

12:59.480 --> 13:01.640
Not sure how, not sure why.

13:01.640 --> 13:05.560
It just looks like a scared battered woman in front of me.

13:05.560 --> 13:07.840
She's just wild with fear.

13:07.840 --> 13:09.960
And therefore you'd lose one sanity

13:09.960 --> 13:13.280
because the success is still losing one sanity on this one.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.120
That is my apologies.

13:15.120 --> 13:18.240
She's real beat up though and that's not right.

13:18.240 --> 13:20.120
It's definitely not right.

13:20.120 --> 13:23.120
Judge Ephraim Courtland, you're going to lose zero sanity

13:23.120 --> 13:27.280
with the full disregard that you have for all humans.

13:27.280 --> 13:31.080
Yeah, I've seen countless people hanging by my own hand,

13:31.080 --> 13:33.160
so really doesn't affect me too much.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.040
Honestly, those smashed up watermelons

13:35.040 --> 13:36.480
made me feel worse than this.

13:38.320 --> 13:41.640
Glad I could add some horror for Judge Ephraim Courtland

13:41.640 --> 13:43.840
in this short arc.

13:43.840 --> 13:47.080
Jack Perlman, you're gonna lose a D4 plus one,

13:47.080 --> 13:48.440
except for with a crit fail,

13:48.440 --> 13:51.640
that D4 is automatically a four,

13:51.640 --> 13:54.320
which means that you lose five sanity,

13:54.320 --> 13:57.600
which just happens to be enough for you

13:57.600 --> 14:00.880
to have a short bout of insanity.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.880
Yay. Oh, lucky.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.120
Yeah, that sounds fun.

14:04.120 --> 14:05.240
Yeah, it's super fun.

14:05.240 --> 14:08.640
So this is the thing where I'm gonna have you rank,

14:08.640 --> 14:13.160
fight, flight, or freeze from most likely to least likely.

14:13.160 --> 14:16.040
Fight, freeze, flight, most likely fight.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.480
If you roll a one, you're gonna run away.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.000
If you roll a two or a three,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.360
you're gonna freeze for one round,

14:22.360 --> 14:25.640
and if you roll four, five, six,

14:25.640 --> 14:27.720
you will immediately fight,

14:28.880 --> 14:33.240
which would just be fine in this situation, seemingly.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.800
That'll be a freeze.

14:34.800 --> 14:35.640
Perfect.

14:35.640 --> 14:37.640
So Jack Perlman, on your turn,

14:37.640 --> 14:39.680
Me and Bobby, doin' the Lord's work.

14:39.680 --> 14:42.560
You're gonna do what future Sheriff Dr. Bobby Custard

14:42.560 --> 14:44.160
is doing, which is...

14:44.200 --> 14:49.200
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.480
Everett Pace, it is your turn.

14:53.480 --> 14:55.040
Judge Courtland threw the lasso.

14:55.040 --> 14:57.440
She grabbed onto it, so she's still holding it onto her end,

14:57.440 --> 14:59.080
and he's holding onto his end, right?

14:59.080 --> 15:00.080
That is correct, yes.

15:00.080 --> 15:02.320
I wanna grab the rope anywhere that I can

15:02.320 --> 15:04.360
to pull as hard as I can,

15:04.360 --> 15:06.840
the purpose being to have her fall on her face.

15:06.840 --> 15:07.680
Sounds good.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.840
You roll, I'll roll.

15:09.840 --> 15:13.120
Everett, you just roll strength.

15:13.120 --> 15:13.960
Will do.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.920
I pass a 23 on a 50.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.960
I pass with a 46.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.520
Fuck.

15:23.520 --> 15:24.800
How does that...

15:24.800 --> 15:27.920
That is an interesting question, Everett Pace.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.040
Can we just be in a stalemate on the tug?

15:32.440 --> 15:34.960
You know what, yeah, since we both passed,

15:36.640 --> 15:39.360
the rope goes completely taut,

15:39.360 --> 15:42.760
and she's looking directly at you

15:42.760 --> 15:46.320
with these wild, wild eyes.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.160
Roll psychology.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.880
Son, I ain't got none of that.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.800
A 96 on a 10.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.720
I got natural world out the wazoo.

15:56.720 --> 15:57.680
Would that help me?

15:57.680 --> 15:59.200
Yeah, go ahead and roll that.

16:01.360 --> 16:04.160
I pass that a 53 on an 80.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.840
You've seen a feral possum.

16:07.520 --> 16:08.360
Yeah, for sure.

16:08.360 --> 16:12.680
These eyes, this sick combination of fear,

16:12.680 --> 16:17.040
loathing, and pure rage of needing to survive.

16:17.040 --> 16:18.360
And Las Vegas.

16:20.120 --> 16:23.800
Has only ever been seen in modern day in Las Vegas,

16:23.800 --> 16:28.160
and in the eyes of feral possums,

16:28.160 --> 16:30.760
and I'm sure other things.

16:32.320 --> 16:33.960
Feral mongese.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.320
No, those are cute no matter what.

16:35.320 --> 16:36.160
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.000
And with that...

16:37.080 --> 16:38.200
Feral skunks.

16:39.560 --> 16:40.720
It's Jack Perlmanster.

16:41.920 --> 16:44.920
Oh, I get to do something. Feral spirits.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.440
No, I just want you to tell me...

16:47.440 --> 16:48.600
How scared I am.

16:48.600 --> 16:49.720
Will Ferrell? Yeah, just talk to me

16:49.720 --> 16:52.720
about what's happening in your brain.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.440
So inside of Jack's brain,

16:55.440 --> 16:58.600
he's been beaten down just sanity-wise

16:58.600 --> 17:01.280
over and over and over again from the get-go,

17:01.280 --> 17:05.080
because I think I failed every sanity roll this time.

17:06.080 --> 17:08.040
But he's just hit the breaking point

17:08.040 --> 17:10.520
where it's like the rubber band of stress

17:10.520 --> 17:13.480
has been stretched too much, and it snapped.

17:13.480 --> 17:16.120
And when it snapped, he just, he can't do anything.

17:16.120 --> 17:17.840
He doesn't know how to put it back together

17:17.840 --> 17:20.680
and do something that's useful right now.

17:20.680 --> 17:21.960
Paralyzed.

17:21.960 --> 17:24.280
I'm paralyzed with fear, baby.

17:24.280 --> 17:25.320
He says to Everett.

17:29.640 --> 17:30.880
Hey, Everett, I can't move.

17:30.880 --> 17:32.920
I'm too scared right now.

17:32.920 --> 17:35.320
And as those thoughts are going through your brain,

17:35.320 --> 17:36.960
out of the corner of your eye,

17:36.960 --> 17:41.880
you see Tilde be this crazed teenage girl

17:41.880 --> 17:46.160
in a complete bout of madness in her own right,

17:46.160 --> 17:50.560
drops the rope and lunges directly at your neck.

17:52.280 --> 17:56.280
Unable to respond, she doesn't even try to pin you.

17:56.280 --> 18:00.480
She just like, mouth first, goes straight to your neck.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.280
She misses the jugular.

18:02.280 --> 18:05.560
She goes around the side, almost behind your ear,

18:05.560 --> 18:07.120
and bites down.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.880
You're gonna lose four damage.

18:10.680 --> 18:15.680
As she bites down to where her teeth, top and bottom,

18:15.760 --> 18:19.640
touch, and then she rips her head back.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.120
Blood begins pouring down,

18:22.120 --> 18:26.840
and you feel the shirt on your back become wet

18:26.840 --> 18:31.360
with thick, hot Jack Pearlman blood juice.

18:32.600 --> 18:33.600
That's yucky.

18:33.600 --> 18:36.960
And she begins chewing.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.940
Judge, Courtland, it is your turn.

18:42.280 --> 18:45.120
So the rope gets let go of

18:45.120 --> 18:47.760
and kind of, you know, loses all of the tension.

18:47.760 --> 18:51.280
And the opium is really starting to hit the judge right now

18:51.280 --> 18:53.720
combined with all the whiskey he's drank.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.120
So he- I forgot about that.

18:55.120 --> 18:57.200
He starts to nod off a little bit

18:57.200 --> 19:01.920
and then wakes up and just starts to coil the rope

19:02.560 --> 19:05.160
back and then takes a swig of whiskey

19:05.160 --> 19:08.120
and just lackadaisically starts tying it

19:08.120 --> 19:10.160
into an actual lasso.

19:10.160 --> 19:11.000
Okay.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.720
Unaware of what's happening to Jack.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.960
Yeah, completely unaware.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.360
Horace Green is now on the ground.

19:18.360 --> 19:20.880
Jack Pearlman is standing there

19:20.880 --> 19:23.600
with part of his shoulder neck.

19:23.600 --> 19:27.200
His traps are missing on one side a little bit.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.780
And blood gushing down his shirt.

19:29.820 --> 19:33.220
Judge Ephraim Courtland staring off into the distance,

19:33.220 --> 19:36.500
coiling up his lasso and ever at pace,

19:36.500 --> 19:40.180
holding on to the other end of that there rope.

19:40.180 --> 19:44.900
Silas Cole stands up from his position, still handcuffed,

19:44.900 --> 19:49.900
and begins making his way toward the front door of the house

19:50.260 --> 19:52.820
and he gets up onto the porch

19:52.820 --> 19:57.820
before it is Bobby Custard's turn, who immediately turns.

19:58.220 --> 20:03.220
Okay, now Silas, something crazy's going on here and...

20:03.540 --> 20:07.380
And with that notices, Tildy B takes his attention

20:07.380 --> 20:12.380
off of Silas and is going to fire at Tildy B. Mitchell.

20:12.820 --> 20:16.740
Strikes true with eight damage.

20:16.740 --> 20:17.820
Nice.

20:17.820 --> 20:18.660
Yeah.

20:18.660 --> 20:22.540
Fires three rounds into Tildy B. Mitchell's chest,

20:22.540 --> 20:27.340
who staggers backwards and lets out another.

20:27.340 --> 20:28.180
Ahhh!

20:33.580 --> 20:34.980
Fuck.

20:34.980 --> 20:37.940
Three bullet holes in her.

20:37.940 --> 20:41.940
Blood begins pouring down her shirt

20:41.940 --> 20:45.120
that is clearly the cut of another time.

20:45.120 --> 20:48.460
I don't know how many different ways I can say that.

20:48.460 --> 20:50.880
Some kind of future cloth.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.780
What is Forever 21?

20:57.660 --> 21:00.000
Everett Pace, it's your turn.

21:01.460 --> 21:04.260
I wanna take some of the watermelon out of my pocket

21:04.260 --> 21:06.700
and throw it toward her feet.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.460
I'm trying to bait her, so I'm saying things like,

21:09.460 --> 21:11.180
here, here, you hungry, you hungry?

21:11.180 --> 21:13.540
Here, here, take some of this, take some of this.

21:13.540 --> 21:16.160
And I'm just chucking watermelon out of my pockets

21:16.160 --> 21:17.000
onto the ground in front of her.

21:17.000 --> 21:21.140
I thought you were going for like a banana peel effect.

21:21.140 --> 21:23.600
Either way, either way, I'll take either way.

21:25.540 --> 21:26.380
Boy, howdy.

21:26.380 --> 21:29.620
Okay, I bet you don't have charm.

21:29.620 --> 21:31.220
So let's have you roll.

21:32.620 --> 21:35.780
Even though Everett charms all of our hearts,

21:35.780 --> 21:37.820
every week on PTBP.

21:38.740 --> 21:42.540
I've got farming and this is a pretty classic farming skill.

21:42.540 --> 21:45.740
You gotta throw watermelon at the ground sometimes.

21:45.740 --> 21:50.740
For fertilizer to get the chickens back into the coop.

21:50.740 --> 21:53.060
And if you run into a feral possum,

21:53.060 --> 21:55.980
it's handy to have some watermelon in your pocket

21:56.540 --> 21:58.140
to feed it to get its attention away from you

21:58.140 --> 21:58.980
while you get away.

21:58.980 --> 22:02.060
Yeah, so give him like a plus 20 on that roll, Zach.

22:02.060 --> 22:04.260
You could just do that for us real quick.

22:08.680 --> 22:11.340
Okay, roll farming.

22:11.340 --> 22:12.220
Are you, okay.

22:13.780 --> 22:14.620
I pass.

22:17.180 --> 22:19.300
It's a 41 out of 60.

22:19.300 --> 22:24.300
This watermelon goo in the most appetizing way

22:25.300 --> 22:27.400
you possibly could have.

22:28.700 --> 22:30.500
Michelin star.

22:30.500 --> 22:33.140
For an animal, oh my God.

22:33.140 --> 22:36.180
This watermelon goop is so well plated

22:36.180 --> 22:38.900
on this dusty, dusty ground.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.700
As if I was planting it.

22:40.700 --> 22:43.460
That's how well it's landed in this ground.

22:44.740 --> 22:46.180
Jesus.

22:46.180 --> 22:47.820
Yeah, no matter what happens,

22:47.820 --> 22:49.700
whether I remember to or not,

22:49.700 --> 22:54.540
the epilogue of this story is the growth

22:54.540 --> 22:56.300
of watermelons next year.

22:57.980 --> 23:00.980
Hey, I wanna throw that watermelon on the ground

23:00.980 --> 23:02.280
and start getting out of there.

23:02.280 --> 23:03.260
It's a distraction.

23:03.260 --> 23:05.180
So I'm walking back toward the horses.

23:05.180 --> 23:09.380
Can our next arc be like going inside one of the characters

23:09.380 --> 23:11.340
cause he swallowed a watermelon seed

23:11.340 --> 23:14.060
and it's gonna grow inside of him.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.420
We gotta get it out.

23:15.420 --> 23:17.180
Are you playing the watermelon seed?

23:17.180 --> 23:18.020
Sure.

23:18.020 --> 23:18.840
Yes.

23:18.880 --> 23:19.880
Watermelon seeds.

23:19.880 --> 23:21.400
We're food in the next arc.

23:23.120 --> 23:24.480
Everett, go ahead and roll.

23:24.480 --> 23:26.000
Are you trying to sneak away

23:26.000 --> 23:29.200
or are you just kind of walking?

23:29.200 --> 23:30.080
Just kind of walking,

23:30.080 --> 23:31.840
hoping that I distracted her enough

23:31.840 --> 23:33.960
that her attention is not on me.

23:33.960 --> 23:34.780
Okay.

23:34.780 --> 23:35.620
But I don't have stealth.

23:35.620 --> 23:37.700
I mean, that's just not something I can do.

23:37.700 --> 23:38.960
Yeah, no, you can walk away.

23:38.960 --> 23:39.800
That's fine.

23:39.800 --> 23:42.200
There wasn't a lot to hide behind anyway.

23:42.200 --> 23:43.260
No big rocks.

23:44.200 --> 23:46.680
I mean, if you're on stealth, big rock appear.

23:47.680 --> 23:49.840
You roll stealth, big rock appear.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.800
Jack Promo, what are you up to?

23:51.800 --> 23:55.120
Oh, you know, slowly dying probably.

23:55.120 --> 23:56.520
That's what it feels like

23:56.520 --> 23:59.560
as I put my hand over what used to be

23:59.560 --> 24:01.040
part of my neck and shoulder.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.040
And now I assume it's like a donut.

24:03.040 --> 24:05.680
Like when you take just a single or like a bagel

24:05.680 --> 24:07.920
and it's that perfectly round bite,

24:07.920 --> 24:12.320
but just out of the chunk of my well-toned shoulders.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.320
Oh, Jack.

24:13.320 --> 24:17.320
You ever fall in love with your own character?

24:17.320 --> 24:20.320
Yep, that's exactly why.

24:22.160 --> 24:25.920
Roll to, I want to roll to kiss Jack Pearlman.

24:25.920 --> 24:27.020
Justin does.

24:28.120 --> 24:30.120
Oh, I crit failed again.

24:30.120 --> 24:33.120
Am I like kind of shocked back into reality

24:33.120 --> 24:34.560
with the bite I'm assuming?

24:34.560 --> 24:35.400
I'm like, whoa.

24:35.400 --> 24:36.220
Yeah.

24:36.220 --> 24:37.840
You were in slow-mo before.

24:37.840 --> 24:42.840
And then as soon as she rips the muscle up out of your neck,

24:43.800 --> 24:47.280
everything fast-forwards back in place.

24:47.280 --> 24:48.540
Back to reality.

24:48.540 --> 24:49.640
Back to reality.

24:49.640 --> 24:52.600
I want to like try and,

24:52.600 --> 24:55.960
is she like real fast and kind of like spindly and wiry?

24:55.960 --> 24:57.640
Yeah, she's not giving up that easy.

24:57.640 --> 24:58.960
I would like to like,

24:58.960 --> 25:01.400
can I like grapple her to the ground almost

25:01.400 --> 25:03.920
and like hold her down on the ground?

25:03.920 --> 25:05.440
You can certainly try to do that, yeah.

25:05.440 --> 25:06.260
Okay.

25:06.260 --> 25:07.100
Shove her face in that watermelon.

25:07.100 --> 25:09.600
I have fighting brawl or strength, I don't know.

25:09.600 --> 25:11.740
Fighting brawl would be the one

25:11.780 --> 25:13.300
that I would like you to roll against me on.

25:13.300 --> 25:14.140
Okey-dokey.

25:14.140 --> 25:15.820
And yeah, I basically want to just like

25:15.820 --> 25:18.600
grapple her to the ground and kind of like hold on to her,

25:18.600 --> 25:21.580
but in a position where I cannot be bit, like.

25:21.580 --> 25:22.540
Yes.

25:22.540 --> 25:25.100
She succeeded with an off four.

25:25.100 --> 25:27.140
I got a 10.

25:27.140 --> 25:28.220
Yeah.

25:28.220 --> 25:29.360
Yeah, that'll do.

25:29.360 --> 25:30.860
With a success.

25:30.860 --> 25:31.700
Hell yeah.

25:31.700 --> 25:32.520
That'll do.

25:32.520 --> 25:35.900
So for a pin, no damage will be dealt to her,

25:35.900 --> 25:38.580
but you are now pinning her,

25:38.580 --> 25:42.100
which gives her a negative and you a positive

25:42.100 --> 25:45.580
on your next rolls and her a negative on any opposing rolls.

25:45.580 --> 25:46.420
Okay.

25:46.420 --> 25:47.260
You're moving forward.

25:47.260 --> 25:49.500
However, as you have her pinned to the ground,

25:49.500 --> 25:51.020
you look around you.

25:51.020 --> 25:52.200
Right next to you on the ground,

25:52.200 --> 25:53.860
you see Professor Horace Green,

25:53.860 --> 25:56.300
who just lost another hit point this round.

25:56.300 --> 25:57.780
Oh no.

25:57.780 --> 25:59.140
Four.

25:59.140 --> 26:00.340
Oh shit.

26:00.340 --> 26:01.380
Damn.

26:01.380 --> 26:04.300
Everett Pace, who is slowly backing away

26:04.300 --> 26:06.140
from the entire situation.

26:06.140 --> 26:10.740
Silas Cole, who is on the porch of the house,

26:10.740 --> 26:13.540
heading into his home, hopefully.

26:13.540 --> 26:15.960
Preacher Sheriff Bobby Custard,

26:15.960 --> 26:18.520
who is gun drawn looking around.

26:18.520 --> 26:20.320
So he seems to be a good ally here.

26:20.320 --> 26:21.460
And Judge Ephraim Courtland,

26:21.460 --> 26:24.260
who seems to not care so much about all this,

26:24.260 --> 26:26.140
care far more about getting his rope

26:26.140 --> 26:29.540
back into its upright position.

26:29.540 --> 26:32.820
Y'all better get on over here and help me out now.

26:32.820 --> 26:33.640
Everett.

26:34.160 --> 26:37.240
He's walking away from me.

26:37.240 --> 26:38.840
It's Tildy B. Mitchell's turn again

26:38.840 --> 26:40.880
and I'm gonna go pee real quick.

26:40.880 --> 26:43.640
Hey, I do wanna bring up for Horace's sake

26:43.640 --> 26:46.680
that opium is a natural painkiller,

26:46.680 --> 26:48.940
so if that can help in any way.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.280
And he smoked some of it.

26:53.280 --> 26:54.680
Yeah, no, he can't feel it.

26:56.720 --> 26:57.560
You like that?

26:57.560 --> 26:58.600
Good, good.

26:58.600 --> 27:00.240
He can't feel that he's dying.

27:01.240 --> 27:05.160
Can't believe I rolled a 99 and then a 10 on these guys.

27:05.160 --> 27:06.400
High and low.

27:06.400 --> 27:07.800
Thank God he hit that 10, though.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.640
That gives us a moment.

27:09.640 --> 27:11.960
I would have probably died, I think.

27:11.960 --> 27:14.120
What happened to Horace Green?

27:14.120 --> 27:15.700
That's when the dogs were getting here,

27:15.700 --> 27:16.880
so I couldn't hear.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.120
He shot his knee off.

27:18.120 --> 27:22.440
He crit failed a gunshot.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.320
Oh, no.

27:24.320 --> 27:27.360
Did she attack you first and then you did it?

27:27.360 --> 27:29.680
He said that she was going to attack him,

27:29.960 --> 27:31.360
so he preemptively shot.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.600
Yeah, I tried to shoot at her and just blew my knee off.

27:33.600 --> 27:35.400
Oh, my God.

27:35.400 --> 27:37.480
I thought she'd like crit attacked you

27:37.480 --> 27:39.300
or something like that in success.

27:39.300 --> 27:40.320
That's crazy.

27:40.320 --> 27:41.600
Good old crit fail.

27:41.600 --> 27:42.560
Always fun.

27:42.560 --> 27:43.720
It was a hundred, too.

27:43.720 --> 27:45.120
It was the crittest of fails.

27:45.120 --> 27:48.320
I saw the roll, but I didn't see what led up

27:48.320 --> 27:49.760
or what happened because of it.

27:49.760 --> 27:50.600
Oh, right.

27:50.600 --> 27:51.600
That's fucking wild.

27:52.600 --> 27:53.700
Wanna hear a joke?

27:53.700 --> 27:54.680
Yeah, go for it.

27:55.640 --> 27:58.800
Okay, a big Texan cowboy stopped at a local restaurant

27:58.800 --> 28:02.080
following a day of drinking and roaming around in Mexico.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.260
While sipping his tequila,

28:03.260 --> 28:05.680
he noticed a sizzling scrumptious looking platter

28:05.680 --> 28:07.360
being served at the next table.

28:07.360 --> 28:10.320
Not only did it look good, but the smell was wonderful.

28:10.320 --> 28:12.720
He asked the waiter, what is that you just served?

28:12.720 --> 28:15.040
The waiter replied, ah, you have excellent taste.

28:15.040 --> 28:17.520
Those are bull testicles from the bullfight this morning.

28:17.520 --> 28:18.840
Delicacy.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.960
The cowboy undaunted said, what the heck?

28:20.960 --> 28:21.780
I'm on vacation.

28:21.780 --> 28:22.620
I'll have some.

28:22.620 --> 28:24.640
The waiter replied, I'm so sorry.

28:24.640 --> 28:26.280
There's only one serving per day

28:26.280 --> 28:28.600
because there's only one bullfight each morning.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.080
If you place your order now,

28:30.080 --> 28:32.840
we'll be sure to save you the delicacy for tomorrow.

28:32.840 --> 28:34.740
The cowboy placed the order and the next evening,

28:34.740 --> 28:37.520
he was served the one and only special delicacy of the day.

28:37.520 --> 28:39.860
After a few bites and inspecting the contents

28:39.860 --> 28:42.180
of his platter, he called to the waiter and said,

28:42.180 --> 28:44.760
these are delicious, but they're quite a bit smaller

28:44.760 --> 28:47.080
than the ones I saw you serve yesterday.

28:47.080 --> 28:49.000
The waiter shrugged his shoulders and replied,

28:49.000 --> 28:50.620
sometimes the bull wins.

28:52.040 --> 28:53.280
Nice.

28:53.280 --> 28:54.120
It's a good one.

28:54.120 --> 28:56.040
So it was like he ate the person's balls.

28:56.040 --> 28:58.440
He ate the matador's balls.

28:59.260 --> 29:00.100
Nice.

29:00.100 --> 29:01.400
If only he'd been there a day earlier,

29:01.400 --> 29:03.680
he could have gotten the bull's testicles that he wanted.

29:03.680 --> 29:06.440
Yeah, that's actually more of a dramatic tale

29:06.440 --> 29:07.280
that you told us.

29:07.280 --> 29:10.400
A cowboy asked me if I could help him round up 18 cows.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.540
I said, sure, that's 20 cows.

29:19.540 --> 29:20.600
I like it.

29:20.600 --> 29:25.600
Jack Perlman, roll, brawling, fight again for me.

29:25.600 --> 29:30.600
What if I don't want to tell you what I rolled

29:31.280 --> 29:33.080
because it's 61 on a 60.

29:34.080 --> 29:39.080
Oh, and with the success from this unnatural teenager,

29:39.560 --> 29:44.560
Jack Perlman is thrown at least four feet in the air

29:44.940 --> 29:48.480
and he lands on his back.

29:48.480 --> 29:51.860
You'll take no damage from this, but.

29:51.860 --> 29:54.960
It's scary, but don't make me roll a sanity, please.

29:55.600 --> 29:59.520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

29:59.520 --> 30:00.360
Roll sanity.

30:00.360 --> 30:01.180
Okay.

30:04.640 --> 30:05.480
Fail.

30:05.480 --> 30:06.960
Oh, God damn it.

30:08.960 --> 30:12.280
I've lost nine sanity so far in these episodes.

30:12.280 --> 30:15.600
Lose one more as you're staring up at the sky,

30:15.600 --> 30:19.640
you think about, was Perlman a religious man?

30:19.640 --> 30:20.840
No.

30:20.840 --> 30:21.660
He is now.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.280
Should have been praying.

30:26.440 --> 30:27.360
Oh my God.

30:27.360 --> 30:29.080
Judge F from Courtland, it's your turn.

30:29.080 --> 30:32.640
After the judge gets his rope coiled up,

30:32.640 --> 30:37.440
he notices that Silas is not on the ground by him anymore

30:37.440 --> 30:39.640
and catches him out of the corner of his eye

30:39.640 --> 30:43.260
and sees him running off towards his house.

30:43.260 --> 30:44.520
And he's going to drop the rope

30:44.520 --> 30:47.360
and just chase after Silas.

30:47.360 --> 30:48.200
Okay.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.280
And if I can get to him, I want to grab him.

30:50.280 --> 30:54.680
Let's go ahead and have you roll.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.280
Character sheet here.

30:56.280 --> 30:59.000
Climb for climbing stairs.

31:00.340 --> 31:03.760
Drive wagon coach, which is what everybody in town

31:03.760 --> 31:05.360
calls your fat ass.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.960
I'm not seeing anything.

31:13.960 --> 31:15.920
So I'll have your old dexterity.

31:15.920 --> 31:16.760
Okay.

31:19.720 --> 31:21.800
29 on a 60.

31:21.800 --> 31:23.280
Nice.

31:23.280 --> 31:24.120
39.

31:24.320 --> 31:25.160
Fuck.

31:25.160 --> 31:26.000
Damn.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.240
Gotcha, baby.

31:27.240 --> 31:28.080
It makes sense.

31:28.080 --> 31:31.280
Judge F from Courtland's this big lumbering creature,

31:31.280 --> 31:34.340
almost as horrifying as Tildy B. Mitchell.

31:34.340 --> 31:37.900
And he makes it right up onto the stairs

31:37.900 --> 31:42.900
as Silas Cole slams the door directly in his face.

31:44.040 --> 31:45.920
Ephraim stops at the stairs

31:45.920 --> 31:48.240
and just kind of like blinks hard and looks

31:48.240 --> 31:51.440
and takes another swig of his whiskey.

31:51.440 --> 31:56.280
Preacher Sheriff, Dr. Bobby Custard is going to...

31:56.280 --> 31:57.320
Save us all.

31:57.320 --> 32:01.380
Actually, let's see who's going to roll this for me.

32:01.380 --> 32:03.200
Joe, you can roll it.

32:03.200 --> 32:05.480
Roll a D six.

32:05.480 --> 32:07.640
If you roll a one, two or three,

32:07.640 --> 32:09.440
he's going to shoot Tildy B. Mitchell.

32:09.440 --> 32:10.800
If you roll four, five or six,

32:10.800 --> 32:12.720
he's going to start giving first aid

32:12.720 --> 32:14.220
to Professor Horse Green.

32:15.320 --> 32:16.340
It's a four.

32:16.340 --> 32:17.320
Right next to his bag,

32:17.320 --> 32:22.320
he grabs his medicine bag out of his side saddle there,

32:23.080 --> 32:24.540
part of his tack.

32:24.540 --> 32:25.380
Nice.

32:26.520 --> 32:27.600
Maybe, I don't know.

32:30.040 --> 32:32.760
And he rushes to Horse Green

32:32.760 --> 32:37.340
and begins successfully doing first aid.

32:38.280 --> 32:42.640
Horse Green, conscious again, you gain three hit points.

32:43.520 --> 32:44.360
Hello.

32:47.480 --> 32:51.160
His eyes open and he says, hello.

32:51.160 --> 32:53.000
I don't feel a thing.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.240
Now his eyes open and he says,

32:55.240 --> 32:56.080
Ah!

32:57.360 --> 32:58.200
Ah!

33:00.460 --> 33:01.300
Ah!

33:04.440 --> 33:05.260
Help me!

33:05.260 --> 33:07.640
And your face, it's your turn.

33:07.640 --> 33:09.920
So she's devouring this watermelon

33:09.920 --> 33:13.800
and she's just all about the watermelon right now, right?

33:14.760 --> 33:17.720
Like it's probably her favorite thing right now, right?

33:17.720 --> 33:19.520
She might be looking at the watermelon.

33:19.520 --> 33:20.920
She's scrambling over toward it.

33:20.920 --> 33:22.600
She thinks it's part of Jack still.

33:22.600 --> 33:25.240
Her socks have little watermelon slices on them,

33:25.240 --> 33:26.420
so you know she's a fan.

33:26.420 --> 33:30.040
And he's trying to get to Sheriff Bobby Custard's horse

33:30.040 --> 33:32.640
to grab the rifle out of the side saddle there.

33:32.640 --> 33:33.460
Smart.

33:33.460 --> 33:36.640
Can I get there in time and shoot or do I just get there?

33:36.640 --> 33:38.040
No, you can get there and shoot.

33:38.040 --> 33:42.000
I'd like to shoot at Tildy B, at the scary zombie lady.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.480
Yeah, you don't know her name.

33:44.000 --> 33:44.840
And she screams,

33:44.840 --> 33:45.680
Ah!

33:45.680 --> 33:46.520
Ah!

33:46.520 --> 33:48.680
My name is Tildy B Bitcha!

33:50.360 --> 33:52.440
So now we can all start calling her that.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.460
Oh my God.

34:00.360 --> 34:01.540
Oh, I can push.

34:01.540 --> 34:02.840
So I rolled a 77.

34:02.840 --> 34:05.520
That would be a crit fail on a 70.

34:05.520 --> 34:06.800
I'm gonna push this roll.

34:06.800 --> 34:08.200
I forgot about pushing.

34:08.200 --> 34:09.620
Hey, you know what?

34:09.620 --> 34:11.040
You can't push.

34:11.040 --> 34:12.400
Oh, a fucking crit.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.800
God damn it.

34:13.800 --> 34:14.760
Oh, cool, okay.

34:14.760 --> 34:16.820
God damn it.

34:17.840 --> 34:18.680
Okay.

34:18.680 --> 34:19.520
What?

34:19.520 --> 34:21.280
Our dice are cursed tonight.

34:21.280 --> 34:22.380
Fuck.

34:22.380 --> 34:23.220
All right, yeah.

34:23.220 --> 34:24.040
That was a crit fail with a...

34:24.040 --> 34:24.880
Roll damage for me.

34:24.880 --> 34:26.380
Yeah, okay.

34:26.380 --> 34:28.560
That's a D10 plus four.

34:28.560 --> 34:29.600
Ooh.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.540
Four, so eight total.

34:31.540 --> 34:32.720
Eight total?

34:32.720 --> 34:33.560
Yeah.

34:37.440 --> 34:40.280
Preach your sheriff, Dr. Bobby Custard, let's out a

34:40.280 --> 34:43.160
Ew, oh, fucking shit!

34:46.160 --> 34:47.840
Oh my gosh.

34:47.840 --> 34:49.000
Oh, damn it.

34:50.700 --> 34:51.960
With his own gun.

34:53.660 --> 34:56.240
Professor Horace Green, the first thing you see actually

34:56.240 --> 34:58.320
when you open your eyes and start screaming

34:58.320 --> 35:00.860
once you've come back to reality a little bit,

35:01.800 --> 35:06.800
the front of Preacher Sheriff, Dr. Bobby Custard's torso,

35:07.200 --> 35:11.520
just on his left side, explodes through

35:11.520 --> 35:16.080
and viscera and awful just starts kind of pouring out

35:16.080 --> 35:16.920
the front of him.

35:16.920 --> 35:18.480
My bad, my bad.

35:18.480 --> 35:21.080
It's like you threw a crispy.

35:21.080 --> 35:23.800
I criss-succeeded on my constitution check.

35:23.800 --> 35:26.960
Hell yeah, so he instantly heals and we're all good.

35:26.960 --> 35:27.920
Let's just keep going.

35:27.920 --> 35:28.920
Whose turn is it now?

35:31.400 --> 35:34.720
It is Jack Pearlman's turn as Preacher Sheriff,

35:34.720 --> 35:39.440
Dr. Bobby Custard grabs almost the entire thing of gauze

35:39.440 --> 35:43.560
in his pack and shoves it like a fistful

35:43.560 --> 35:46.200
just right into his own gut.

35:48.120 --> 35:50.880
Jack Pearlman gets his knife out.

35:50.880 --> 35:52.600
He's going for blood.

35:52.600 --> 35:56.200
He's going to stab Tildibee or swipe at her,

35:56.200 --> 35:58.800
whatever, whatever works, whatever you think works.

35:58.800 --> 35:59.960
Stab, swipe.

35:59.960 --> 36:01.080
Stab, swipe.

36:01.080 --> 36:02.360
So you're gonna roll.

36:02.360 --> 36:05.480
I believe it's fighting brawl.

36:05.480 --> 36:08.440
Unless you have a knife skill that's different than that.

36:08.440 --> 36:10.680
The knife is brawl skill.

36:10.680 --> 36:11.520
Oh, that's cool.

36:11.520 --> 36:13.960
Well, I failed, so 72 on a 60.

36:13.960 --> 36:17.400
She did too, so she won't be able to use your knife

36:17.400 --> 36:19.080
against you in any way, but you're just.

36:19.080 --> 36:20.920
Oh, it's good to know that's up for.

36:22.400 --> 36:23.240
Oh, always.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.800
She takes a negative if she's already gone this round,

36:27.800 --> 36:28.720
that's just kind of how it works.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.640
If she was to fight against one of you guys

36:30.640 --> 36:31.520
and you could fight back,

36:31.520 --> 36:32.800
you'd take a negative that round as well.

36:32.800 --> 36:34.520
So I could push though if I wanted to

36:34.520 --> 36:35.920
since I didn't crit fail.

36:37.480 --> 36:38.920
Yes.

36:38.920 --> 36:40.960
But then if I do fail, I crit fail.

36:40.960 --> 36:43.280
Yeah, that is correct. I'm going for it.

36:43.280 --> 36:44.800
Hell yeah, don't stab yourself.

36:44.800 --> 36:47.680
I can't roll this bad this many times.

36:47.680 --> 36:49.400
Right guys, right?

36:49.400 --> 36:51.080
Famous last words.

36:51.080 --> 36:55.560
Okay, so you swing wildly as she, Neo from the Matrix,

36:55.560 --> 36:59.400
like bends back, dodging all of your side swipes.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.000
What are you doing to try to?

37:01.400 --> 37:04.400
So I like to imagine he has it where it's like down,

37:04.400 --> 37:06.760
like he's holding it and it's going down

37:06.760 --> 37:08.320
and he's swiping like that.

37:08.320 --> 37:09.960
And then as he misses one of his swipes,

37:09.960 --> 37:13.160
he's going to go for like jamming it into her instead.

37:13.160 --> 37:14.280
The American plunge.

37:14.280 --> 37:15.120
Yes.

37:16.560 --> 37:17.880
Well, yeah.

37:17.880 --> 37:19.960
She succeeds with a 20.

37:19.960 --> 37:21.480
I fail with a 91.

37:22.480 --> 37:26.600
Oh no, what is your damage on that knife, sir?

37:26.600 --> 37:29.440
A D4 plus two plus a D4.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.160
So two D4 plus two.

37:31.160 --> 37:33.000
What kind of knife was that?

37:33.000 --> 37:34.840
Cause he has a damage bonus.

37:34.840 --> 37:35.680
The knife has a damage bonus.

37:35.680 --> 37:38.640
I'm very strong, so when I stab myself,

37:38.640 --> 37:41.000
it's going to hurt really bad.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.760
All right, do you want to roll one D4

37:42.760 --> 37:45.560
and I'll roll the other one or do you want?

37:45.560 --> 37:47.320
We're connected through our dice.

37:48.200 --> 37:49.040
I rolled a two.

37:49.040 --> 37:51.760
I rolled a one, oh, thank God.

37:51.760 --> 37:52.600
So five?

37:52.600 --> 37:53.440
Yeah, five.

37:53.440 --> 37:54.480
That's still not great.

37:54.480 --> 37:55.880
How many hit points did you have?

37:55.880 --> 37:58.840
I had 10 and now I have five.

37:59.160 --> 38:00.000
What did you start with?

38:00.000 --> 38:00.840
14.

38:00.840 --> 38:01.920
Holy shit, okay.

38:01.920 --> 38:03.520
You had 10, now you have five.

38:03.520 --> 38:07.560
Taking half of your current hit points in one round.

38:07.560 --> 38:09.760
I'm going to need a constitution check for you,

38:09.760 --> 38:12.360
Jack Perlman, and you've been doing nothing

38:12.360 --> 38:14.120
but rolling great this entire time.

38:14.120 --> 38:16.840
So I'm sure you'll have no issues staying conscious.

38:16.840 --> 38:18.560
I'm gonna use one of these metal babies.

38:18.560 --> 38:19.400
Joe.

38:19.400 --> 38:20.720
Metal baby.

38:20.720 --> 38:23.200
I can't believe you fucked me like this, Joe.

38:23.240 --> 38:24.080
Oops.

38:28.000 --> 38:28.840
Wait a minute.

38:28.840 --> 38:29.680
No.

38:29.680 --> 38:30.520
A 10.

38:30.520 --> 38:35.440
Can I only roll the worst ever or super low?

38:35.440 --> 38:36.280
Wait, what did you tell me to roll?

38:36.280 --> 38:37.120
No, that's great.

38:37.120 --> 38:38.640
You're still good.

38:38.640 --> 38:41.160
I was confused on what I asked you to roll.

38:41.160 --> 38:42.440
So you can stay conscious.

38:42.440 --> 38:45.760
That was a constitution check in order to stay conscious.

38:45.760 --> 38:49.640
However, your knife is directly in between

38:49.640 --> 38:52.280
the two bones in your femur.

38:52.320 --> 38:54.280
Nope, femur's one bone.

38:54.280 --> 38:55.120
Tibia and fibula.

38:55.120 --> 38:56.120
What's the bone right next to the femur?

38:56.120 --> 38:57.160
PP bone.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.000
It's in your PP bone.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.160
I stabbed my PP.

38:59.160 --> 39:01.160
Tibia and fibula.

39:01.160 --> 39:02.000
Is that your thigh?

39:02.000 --> 39:03.440
That might be in your arm.

39:03.440 --> 39:04.360
No, that's your leg.

39:04.360 --> 39:05.720
It's the lower calf.

39:05.720 --> 39:06.720
Lower part of the leg.

39:06.720 --> 39:07.720
I broke them bad boys.

39:07.720 --> 39:09.440
I don't know shit about no bones.

39:09.440 --> 39:10.360
It's in my leg.

39:10.360 --> 39:13.080
It's in your leg and it is scratching

39:13.080 --> 39:15.640
up against your femur.

39:15.640 --> 39:20.040
You think that if you were to pull out your femur bone

39:20.040 --> 39:24.080
and look at it, it would have Tildi B's initials on it.

39:25.680 --> 39:27.120
It's completely dug in there.

39:27.120 --> 39:29.640
And she helped guide it away from her

39:29.640 --> 39:32.240
and right back directly into your leg.

39:32.240 --> 39:34.520
And it is stuck there.

39:34.520 --> 39:37.480
How could she do that chewing on watermelon?

39:37.480 --> 39:38.520
She's a great multitasker.

39:38.520 --> 39:41.040
Yeah, you forgot to give me my plus 40 bonus.

39:41.040 --> 39:44.920
So from watermelon distraction.

39:44.920 --> 39:46.680
Professor Horace Green, it's been a while.

39:46.680 --> 39:47.640
Indeed.

39:47.640 --> 39:49.600
Am I still losing hit points?

39:49.600 --> 39:50.480
No longer, no.

39:50.480 --> 39:53.840
You've been stabilized by the good preacher sheriff doctor.

39:53.840 --> 39:54.680
Oh, good.

39:54.680 --> 39:56.560
I'd like to shoot Tildi B.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.840
Yes, that does make sense.

39:57.840 --> 39:59.640
If you'd like to roll firearms.

40:03.640 --> 40:06.120
Oh, no.

40:06.120 --> 40:08.200
It's not a crit fail, but a 95.

40:08.200 --> 40:11.360
I'll push it, push it real good.

40:11.360 --> 40:12.200
Fuck it.

40:12.200 --> 40:13.040
Yeah, I'll push it.

40:20.200 --> 40:21.640
Oh, no.

40:21.640 --> 40:23.960
What's a crit fail if you fail a push, right?

40:23.960 --> 40:24.800
Yeah.

40:24.800 --> 40:26.240
Yeah, I failed.

40:26.240 --> 40:27.880
Oh, boy.

40:27.880 --> 40:32.880
Horace, yeah, Horace blind with pain tries to shoot again.

40:37.080 --> 40:39.080
And what does he do, Zach?

40:39.080 --> 40:41.440
Well, guess who's right above him.

40:41.440 --> 40:42.280
Oh, no.

40:42.280 --> 40:45.080
Who just got shot himself with his own rifle.

40:45.080 --> 40:47.360
Who is just giving you first aid.

40:47.360 --> 40:51.560
Who's right in between you and Tildi B. Mitchell.

40:51.560 --> 40:52.920
Bubby.

40:52.920 --> 40:55.800
Right before you can aim your gun down

40:55.800 --> 40:59.680
to point at the unnatural creature tearing apart

40:59.680 --> 41:02.320
Jack Pearlman with his own turns,

41:02.320 --> 41:05.320
you fire the pistol on its way down.

41:05.320 --> 41:06.800
Go ahead and roll damage for me.

41:13.800 --> 41:14.320
Oh, boy.

41:14.320 --> 41:17.000
Was it max damage?

41:17.000 --> 41:17.920
It's 11.

41:17.920 --> 41:20.520
Oh, my god.

41:20.520 --> 41:21.960
I think we got it dead.

41:21.960 --> 41:23.200
Holy shit.

41:26.560 --> 41:29.960
Did you guys know that the gunfight at the OK Corral,

41:29.960 --> 41:33.400
most famous, most infamous gunfight probably of the West,

41:33.400 --> 41:36.400
happened in Tombstone in 1881?

41:36.400 --> 41:38.800
People always think of it as this, you know,

41:38.800 --> 41:39.800
Tombstone, right?

41:39.800 --> 41:41.120
Big gunfight.

41:41.120 --> 41:43.400
Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday.

41:43.400 --> 41:48.840
It only lasted 30 seconds, which is five rounds of this game.

41:48.840 --> 41:53.080
And we're at the end of round three currently.

41:53.080 --> 41:56.240
So this all adds up to me.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.040
Yeah.

41:57.040 --> 41:57.560
Yeah.

41:57.560 --> 42:01.240
In just 20 seconds, we've literally dismantled our shot.

42:01.240 --> 42:04.640
Could you share if Dr. Bobby Custard's head explodes

42:04.640 --> 42:08.600
and his body flies off in a completely different direction

42:08.600 --> 42:10.520
than where you actually shot?

42:10.520 --> 42:13.640
Quentin Tarantino style?

42:13.640 --> 42:14.200
Yeah, no.

42:14.200 --> 42:16.720
He flies into the back of the wagon.

42:16.720 --> 42:20.680
His headless body is just flung.

42:20.680 --> 42:23.920
You Gallagher'd his head.

42:23.920 --> 42:26.000
It's weird that that's the first Gallagher reference.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.920
I was trying to get a Gallagher reference at the other house,

42:28.920 --> 42:32.360
and I just couldn't work it in.

42:32.360 --> 42:36.280
And pretty sure if Dr. Bobby Custard is fully, fully dead,

42:36.280 --> 42:41.200
I need everyone to roll sanity for me, even me,

42:41.200 --> 42:42.880
since I didn't see it.

42:42.880 --> 42:43.600
No, not you.

42:43.600 --> 42:44.920
You feel like Cotton.

42:44.920 --> 42:46.760
Hey, I crit failed again, so.

42:50.200 --> 42:50.800
Jesus.

42:50.800 --> 42:52.600
My god, dude.

42:52.600 --> 42:53.520
What is happening?

42:53.520 --> 42:55.840
I don't know.

42:55.840 --> 43:00.120
This has to be like our crit fails per minute

43:00.120 --> 43:03.080
has to be a record right now.

43:03.080 --> 43:05.440
So I lose like two sanity instead of one?

43:05.480 --> 43:06.640
Yeah.

43:06.640 --> 43:08.360
Yeah, that's exactly right.

43:08.360 --> 43:09.800
I regular failed.

43:09.800 --> 43:12.280
OK, you're going to lose one sanity, Everett Pace.

43:12.280 --> 43:14.680
Jack Perlman knew it would lose two sanity.

43:14.680 --> 43:17.240
And Professor Horace Green.

43:17.240 --> 43:18.280
I pass.

43:18.280 --> 43:19.360
Loses no sanity.

43:19.360 --> 43:22.840
Totally cool with what he did to that guy.

43:22.840 --> 43:26.720
And it blasted the wrong way, so he didn't even see it.

43:26.720 --> 43:29.240
Exactly.

43:29.240 --> 43:32.760
Completely blinded by the gunpowder.

43:32.760 --> 43:34.720
Unable to see.

43:34.720 --> 43:39.200
Here's a noise that sounds like, no, as it's happening.

43:39.200 --> 43:41.200
And honestly, that noise is coming out

43:41.200 --> 43:44.400
of these vocal cords that are hanging out

43:44.400 --> 43:48.240
the top of this body, just waggling back and forth

43:48.240 --> 43:49.920
in the arid wind.

43:49.920 --> 43:56.040
And you assume that that noise is Tildy B. Mitchell,

43:56.040 --> 43:58.400
the unnatural creature that you must have surely

43:58.400 --> 43:59.600
killed just now.

43:59.600 --> 44:03.160
However, at the top of this round,

44:03.160 --> 44:06.720
you all see Tildy B releases the knife that

44:06.720 --> 44:09.880
is in Jack Perlman's thigh and begins

44:09.880 --> 44:13.080
running as fast as she can.

44:13.080 --> 44:13.840
Away?

44:13.840 --> 44:14.680
Away.

44:14.680 --> 44:15.920
Oh.

44:15.920 --> 44:19.320
She runs around the backside of the house.

44:19.320 --> 44:22.640
And she actually runs so far in this round.

44:22.640 --> 44:24.520
This is a six-second round.

44:24.520 --> 44:26.640
She makes it about 75 yards.

44:26.640 --> 44:27.920
Holy fuck.

44:27.920 --> 44:34.520
And you could see that she is running up out of this area

44:34.520 --> 44:38.560
in a southwesterly direction.

44:38.560 --> 44:42.200
That's the son of a bitch what killed Dandelion.

44:42.200 --> 44:46.120
I yell to no one in particular.

44:46.120 --> 44:49.800
And with that is Judge Ephraim Cortland's turn.

44:49.800 --> 44:53.480
He walks up the stairs, kicks the door as hard as he can,

44:53.480 --> 44:56.040
and yells, Silas, get out here.

44:56.040 --> 44:58.560
I'll burn your fucking house down.

44:58.560 --> 45:02.880
And he is digging around in his pocket for his lighter.

45:02.880 --> 45:04.160
Holy shit.

45:04.160 --> 45:06.960
But I want to try to kick the door down at the same time.

45:06.960 --> 45:08.000
Thin door.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.280
You can certainly do that if everybody else could

45:10.280 --> 45:11.280
take their headphones off.

45:11.600 --> 45:12.100
Whew.

45:21.600 --> 45:26.280
Judge Ephraim Cortland, the smell of rotten flesh

45:26.280 --> 45:28.840
is the first thing you notice when

45:28.840 --> 45:31.800
you kick in the front door of the coal abode.

45:31.800 --> 45:34.320
At first, you think the stench could

45:34.320 --> 45:36.920
be from the unattended dishes strewn

45:36.920 --> 45:41.200
throughout this living room, the ruminants of several meals

45:41.200 --> 45:44.080
now covered in a few buzzing flies.

45:44.080 --> 45:48.480
But that static hum of these buzzing around flies

45:48.480 --> 45:53.560
is so loud in your ears due to the large swarm hovering

45:53.560 --> 45:58.080
above and about the body of Miss Kitty,

45:58.080 --> 46:02.120
which is laying lifeless across one of the sitting chairs.

46:02.120 --> 46:06.520
Lifeless, to be sure, because this body, the skin

46:06.520 --> 46:10.840
is chewed up so badly that chunks are hanging off

46:10.880 --> 46:15.000
or completely missing the dripping dark red blood pooling

46:15.000 --> 46:17.520
below on the floor, but especially

46:17.520 --> 46:21.280
lifeless due to the way this body is crumpled.

46:21.280 --> 46:27.360
Her back held directly in the middle by one of the armrests

46:27.360 --> 46:33.320
there at an unnatural angle as the top half of her torso

46:33.320 --> 46:37.920
dangles straight down perpendicular to the floor.

46:41.360 --> 46:44.400
Roll sanity.

46:44.400 --> 46:48.360
A 50 on a 50.

46:48.360 --> 46:49.240
Oh.

46:49.240 --> 46:53.000
Make it a 49 as you lose one sanity

46:53.000 --> 46:56.320
from this horrifying scene.

46:56.320 --> 47:02.280
And go ahead and roll a listen check for me.

47:02.280 --> 47:03.120
Fail.

47:03.120 --> 47:04.240
That is all.

47:04.240 --> 47:05.560
I'm going in.

47:05.560 --> 47:07.040
Can I see Silas or?

47:07.040 --> 47:07.840
No, no.

47:07.840 --> 47:09.600
So this is a shotgun style house.

47:09.640 --> 47:12.640
So basically front door leads to the first room

47:12.640 --> 47:15.040
and there's one door all the way ahead of you.

47:15.040 --> 47:15.640
Yep.

47:15.640 --> 47:16.840
I'm going to keep going.

47:16.840 --> 47:17.960
I want to find Silas.

47:17.960 --> 47:21.600
And you're going to be able to make it to the next door.

47:21.600 --> 47:23.240
Is it a closed door?

47:23.240 --> 47:24.320
It's not like an archway.

47:24.320 --> 47:26.320
It is a closed door.

47:26.320 --> 47:32.400
While I'm going, I'm yelling, Silas, get your ass out here.

47:32.400 --> 47:32.880
Awesome.

47:39.600 --> 47:47.960
As this speedy, speedy teenage non-human

47:47.960 --> 47:51.520
takes off into the distance, Judge Courtland

47:51.520 --> 47:53.920
kicks in the door of the Silas home,

47:53.920 --> 47:57.560
takes in his surroundings before you hear,

47:57.560 --> 48:01.520
Silas, get your ass out here.

48:01.520 --> 48:02.720
Sorry.

48:02.720 --> 48:03.520
Who is it?

48:03.520 --> 48:05.160
So many people on this list are dead now.

48:05.160 --> 48:05.640
Everett.

48:05.960 --> 48:10.080
It is Everett Pace.

48:10.080 --> 48:14.480
I want to keep my gun now trained on the front door,

48:14.480 --> 48:16.480
kind of given whatever kind of cover

48:16.480 --> 48:18.160
I can if somebody comes out that front door.

48:18.160 --> 48:20.160
But I want to be making my way to whoever

48:20.160 --> 48:23.920
looks most injured between Jack and Horace.

48:23.920 --> 48:25.720
I could visually tell that, couldn't I?

48:25.720 --> 48:28.160
You would be able to visually tell which one is more injured.

48:28.160 --> 48:29.560
Jack, what are your hit points at?

48:29.560 --> 48:30.480
Five.

48:30.480 --> 48:31.920
What are you at, Thomas?

48:31.920 --> 48:32.440
Three.

48:32.440 --> 48:33.120
Oh, shit.

48:33.120 --> 48:35.040
I'm going to head over to Professor Horace

48:35.040 --> 48:39.840
and try and do a little first aid on him.

48:39.840 --> 48:40.400
That cool?

48:45.880 --> 48:47.480
Professor Horace freaks out.

48:47.480 --> 48:50.480
It's a crit pass, a 66 on a 70.

48:50.480 --> 48:51.320
Yeah.

48:51.320 --> 48:52.200
Four.

48:52.200 --> 48:54.200
Four hit points right off the bat.

48:54.200 --> 48:57.680
I feel like half my old self again.

48:57.680 --> 48:59.440
Sheriff Bobby got his head blown off.

48:59.440 --> 49:01.160
He just dropped all his medical supplies

49:01.160 --> 49:02.280
right there on the ground.

49:02.880 --> 49:06.320
I reached down and grabbed with one hand some gauze

49:06.320 --> 49:10.480
and just like patted it into the knee area.

49:10.480 --> 49:13.240
And I've done it a lot.

49:13.240 --> 49:15.040
Living out there on the land by myself,

49:15.040 --> 49:17.240
I had to patch up myself all the time.

49:17.240 --> 49:18.280
So I'm real good at it.

49:18.280 --> 49:21.800
And I keep one gun trained on the door, my rifle,

49:21.800 --> 49:24.920
and the crook of my elbow here while I get his knee back

49:24.920 --> 49:25.760
in tip top shape.

49:25.760 --> 49:26.320
Perlin.

49:26.320 --> 49:30.720
I would like to perform first aid on my leg, my thigh.

49:30.720 --> 49:31.200
What?

49:31.200 --> 49:31.960
My thigh.

49:31.960 --> 49:33.920
My thigh.

49:33.920 --> 49:36.760
Thigh.

49:36.760 --> 49:38.760
Tell me about it, stud.

49:38.760 --> 49:43.480
I want to rip off a chunk of my shirt with my teeth

49:43.480 --> 49:46.240
and tear it up and then wrap it real tight.

49:46.240 --> 49:50.800
It perfectly cuts like Queen Amidala.

49:50.800 --> 49:53.840
It perfectly cuts into a cute little crop top.

49:53.840 --> 49:57.320
Oh, yeah, I do from the tummy, not from my sleeve.

49:57.320 --> 50:00.320
Remember that bullshit.

50:00.320 --> 50:03.560
Yeah, I do the tummy cloth, not the arm.

50:03.560 --> 50:07.120
I was thinking arm cloth, but I like the idea

50:07.120 --> 50:09.800
of a long sleeve crop top.

50:09.800 --> 50:15.000
Like a long sleeve dress shirt crop top.

50:15.000 --> 50:18.480
Jack Perlman is a man of great fashion.

50:18.480 --> 50:21.520
And of not weight.

50:21.520 --> 50:22.680
Yeah, not passing.

50:22.680 --> 50:23.680
Regular fail.

50:23.680 --> 50:25.160
You just kind of wrap it around.

50:25.160 --> 50:27.040
Yeah, great.

50:27.040 --> 50:31.360
What happens if you push a first aid roll and then fail?

50:31.360 --> 50:35.600
What's a crit, fail, first aid look like?

50:35.600 --> 50:37.280
Slice the artery.

50:37.280 --> 50:39.280
Do you want to find out?

50:39.280 --> 50:40.200
I'm going to push it.

50:40.200 --> 50:41.320
He's going to find out.

50:41.320 --> 50:42.240
What's your first aid?

50:42.240 --> 50:43.880
Yeah, is this worth it?

50:43.880 --> 50:44.800
Oh, shit.

50:44.800 --> 50:47.560
That's pretty good bad.

50:47.560 --> 50:48.440
It's 50-50.

50:48.440 --> 50:49.440
Pretty good, pretty bad.

50:49.440 --> 50:51.200
Let's see what happens.

50:51.200 --> 50:53.960
Do it for the vine, bro.

50:53.960 --> 50:54.800
Oh, no.

50:58.040 --> 50:59.600
Wait, hold on.

50:59.600 --> 51:00.240
Yeah, yeah.

51:00.240 --> 51:01.320
Yeah, that's a fail.

51:01.320 --> 51:04.480
Yeah, I rolled the exact same fucking thing again.

51:04.480 --> 51:05.880
What are the chances?

51:05.880 --> 51:08.440
What is happening?

51:08.440 --> 51:12.480
Jack Perlman, roll a D4.

51:12.480 --> 51:13.360
Oh, a four.

51:13.360 --> 51:14.000
That's good.

51:17.520 --> 51:22.120
Jack, you wrap the shirt around, and it

51:22.120 --> 51:23.520
doesn't stop the bleeding.

51:23.520 --> 51:25.520
And so you think to yourself, well, obviously I've

51:25.520 --> 51:26.880
got to get this knife out.

51:26.880 --> 51:29.320
And so you grab onto the handle of your knife.

51:29.320 --> 51:32.480
I thought she took the knife away and ran away with it.

51:32.480 --> 51:33.760
No, she left it in there.

51:33.760 --> 51:34.280
Oh, OK.

51:34.280 --> 51:35.680
Did I say she ran off with it?

51:35.680 --> 51:36.320
I think you might have.

51:36.320 --> 51:37.120
I thought you did.

51:37.120 --> 51:39.200
I thought you said she took it out.

51:39.200 --> 51:40.760
OK, whatever works.

51:40.760 --> 51:42.360
At some specific point, you did say

51:42.360 --> 51:44.280
she dropped your knife, his knife.

51:44.280 --> 51:47.440
I don't know if it was still in his leg when that happened or not.

51:47.440 --> 51:51.560
In my mind, she was just holding it into his leg,

51:51.560 --> 51:56.160
and then she let go and released it so that she could bail,

51:56.160 --> 51:58.760
but just left it in his leg.

51:58.760 --> 52:00.440
She doesn't need a knife.

52:00.440 --> 52:03.120
She got chompy chompies.

52:03.120 --> 52:05.280
She got chompy chompies.

52:05.280 --> 52:07.280
So yeah, I gank that knife out.

52:07.280 --> 52:08.560
Yeah, you pull it right out.

52:08.560 --> 52:11.080
And as you pull it out, it nicks an artery,

52:11.080 --> 52:13.720
and blood just starts going everywhere

52:13.720 --> 52:18.880
as you're desperately trying to tie tighter and tighter

52:18.880 --> 52:22.840
this shirt bottom around your leg.

52:22.840 --> 52:25.280
And you lose four hit points.

52:26.280 --> 52:28.960
Taking you from five to one.

52:28.960 --> 52:31.040
So I'm going to need you to roll another constitution

52:31.040 --> 52:35.040
check to stay conscious.

52:35.040 --> 52:35.520
Joe?

52:35.520 --> 52:36.840
Well, now that we know what happens

52:36.840 --> 52:39.560
if you crit fail a first aid roll, just don't do it, Justin.

52:44.840 --> 52:46.280
Seems pretty obvious in hindsight.

52:46.280 --> 52:50.720
I rolled a crit success on my constitution check, a 44 on an 80.

52:50.720 --> 52:53.680
Then you get to be awake for all this pain.

52:53.760 --> 52:56.080
Extra awake, like super awake.

52:56.080 --> 53:00.920
I'm so conscious during a time I wish I could pass out.

53:00.920 --> 53:04.600
Blood is now soaking the dirt and creating

53:04.600 --> 53:10.200
mudblood underneath the back of your knee here on the ground.

53:10.200 --> 53:11.040
Mudblood.

53:11.040 --> 53:13.560
And Professor Horsegreen, it is your turn.

53:13.560 --> 53:15.680
Oh, also, Jack, your boots are ruined.

53:15.680 --> 53:18.080
God damn it.

53:18.080 --> 53:20.040
Blood is fully soaked into the leather

53:20.040 --> 53:22.000
to the point of non-return.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.160
Well, we're not in combat anymore, are we?

53:24.160 --> 53:25.240
We are.

53:25.240 --> 53:26.920
Oh, with Sylas.

53:26.920 --> 53:28.880
How much mobility do I have?

53:28.880 --> 53:33.440
Mechanically, you're going to be at a disadvantage on anything

53:33.440 --> 53:36.320
that needs you to run or be dexterous or anything

53:36.320 --> 53:36.920
like that.

53:36.920 --> 53:38.760
But you can hobble.

53:38.760 --> 53:44.040
So you're just as good as Everett Pace was always.

53:44.040 --> 53:45.560
OK.

53:45.560 --> 53:47.800
Well, when you put it like that, I hobble over

53:47.800 --> 53:49.760
to where Everett is covering the door.

53:49.760 --> 53:51.480
Is that what you did after you healed me?

53:51.480 --> 53:52.640
I don't think I moved.

53:52.640 --> 53:54.560
I think I just got to your position.

53:54.560 --> 53:56.280
You're all three kind of bunched up

53:56.280 --> 53:59.640
in this location, which I'm picturing about 10 yards away

53:59.640 --> 54:02.920
from the front porch of the Cole home.

54:02.920 --> 54:05.000
You guys are right out front.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.800
Horsegreen crawls behind a wagon or a barrel

54:08.800 --> 54:11.720
or whatever's in Sylas Cole's front yard to find some cover

54:11.720 --> 54:13.720
and trains his pistol on the front door.

54:13.720 --> 54:16.640
And you can very clearly hear Judge Ephraim Courtland

54:16.640 --> 54:18.560
in the living room.

54:18.560 --> 54:23.520
Just a reminder that he was in the first room of this house

54:23.520 --> 54:27.480
hollering, Sylas, get your ass out here.

54:27.480 --> 54:29.600
And the three of you can take your headphones off.

54:38.200 --> 54:41.800
Judge Ephraim Courtland, as you are,

54:41.800 --> 54:43.320
no, you failed your listen check.

54:43.320 --> 54:45.240
So you're just kicking in the next door?

54:45.240 --> 54:45.880
Yeah.

54:45.880 --> 54:48.400
They're trying to just open it if it's open.

54:48.400 --> 54:49.680
Oh, you're just going to open it?

54:49.680 --> 54:50.320
If it is open.

54:50.320 --> 54:51.880
Describe to me exactly what you do.

54:51.880 --> 54:53.680
You know what, I'm pissed off and I'm big.

54:53.680 --> 54:58.120
So after I'm yelling, get your ass out here,

54:58.120 --> 55:01.360
I kick in the other door, the next door.

55:01.360 --> 55:05.080
I need you to roll listen and spot hidden,

55:05.080 --> 55:06.560
two separate rolls.

55:06.560 --> 55:07.560
Listen first.

55:07.560 --> 55:10.560
Listen first.

55:10.560 --> 55:13.320
Fail the listen.

55:13.320 --> 55:18.320
Crit success on the spot hit 33 on him.

55:18.320 --> 55:21.120
45.

55:21.120 --> 55:26.840
As you kick in the door, you find yourself in the bedroom.

55:26.840 --> 55:30.320
The bed has been completely flipped over

55:30.320 --> 55:35.440
to use as cover on the right side of this room.

55:35.440 --> 55:42.040
And you see a small one inch in diameter metal sphere

55:42.040 --> 55:45.800
rolling directly toward you.

55:45.800 --> 55:46.920
What do you do?

55:46.960 --> 55:49.280
I see the sphere, but I don't really

55:49.280 --> 55:50.440
pay any attention to it.

55:50.440 --> 55:51.600
Yeah, it's like a marble.

55:51.600 --> 55:52.160
Yeah.

55:52.160 --> 55:54.440
So I'm going to be careful not to slip on it,

55:54.440 --> 55:59.440
but I'm going to go and just brute force grab the mattress

55:59.440 --> 56:01.880
and throw it away to see if he's behind there.

56:01.880 --> 56:05.960
When you grab the mattress, you just rip it away,

56:05.960 --> 56:09.640
throw it right up against the wall to your side.

56:09.640 --> 56:12.920
And you see Silas Cole, he's hunkered down

56:12.920 --> 56:18.080
and he is chanting something quietly to himself.

56:18.080 --> 56:24.400
Bob da ha ha, Bob da ha ha, Bob da ha ha, Bob da ha ha.

56:24.400 --> 56:25.880
Can I grab him?

56:25.880 --> 56:27.480
You can.

56:27.480 --> 56:28.840
I just go up to him.

56:28.840 --> 56:31.800
I put my right hand on a collar of a shirt.

56:31.800 --> 56:35.080
My left hand, I grab one of the belts he's wearing

56:35.080 --> 56:37.720
and I just lift him up over my head.

56:37.720 --> 56:43.000
And as you do that, you feel a hot pinch

56:43.000 --> 56:44.680
on the back of your neck.

56:44.680 --> 56:52.240
And we, me and you, Luke, we see Judge Ephraim Courtland freeze.

56:52.240 --> 56:57.000
Multiple shiny limbs extend from the small metal sphere

56:57.000 --> 57:01.200
and slam into the wooden floor beneath you,

57:01.200 --> 57:05.080
giving it the leverage it needs to shove down

57:05.080 --> 57:09.320
as one of its appendages slices into the soft tissue

57:09.320 --> 57:12.960
on the back of Judge Ephraim Courtland's neck.

57:12.960 --> 57:18.440
Another snaps his head forward and you hear the fracture

57:18.440 --> 57:21.520
as a third metal tendril reaches in,

57:21.520 --> 57:25.520
gripping the top of Judge Courtland's spine

57:25.520 --> 57:29.080
where it meets his head, the C1 vertebrae,

57:29.080 --> 57:34.080
and it rips his entire spinal cord out of his body

57:34.080 --> 57:38.600
in one swift motion, promptly forcing itself

57:38.600 --> 57:46.080
into the now vacant spinal column of Judge Ephraim Courtland.

57:46.080 --> 57:48.680
So this I'm gonna...

57:48.680 --> 57:54.800
Judge Ephraim Courtland is now being controlled by M-A-R-Y.

57:54.800 --> 57:55.880
Hell yeah.

57:55.880 --> 58:00.600
So your goal is to make sure that there are no witnesses

58:00.600 --> 58:03.160
to what has happened here on the property today.

58:03.160 --> 58:05.160
There are a couple ways you can do this.

58:05.160 --> 58:11.720
One, you can kill them.

58:11.720 --> 58:15.520
You would be able to keep the body of Judge Courtland

58:15.520 --> 58:18.560
if you wanted to do that and then control Courtland

58:18.560 --> 58:20.800
whenever you wanted to around town.

58:20.800 --> 58:22.560
It might be kind of tricky at this point.

58:22.560 --> 58:26.880
M-A-R-Y typically likes to only control

58:26.880 --> 58:29.920
like one townsperson at a time

58:29.920 --> 58:33.720
and then other people that she can use for outside towns.

58:33.720 --> 58:36.400
However, the judge would be a...

58:36.400 --> 58:39.400
A pretty good one to have on their side.

58:39.400 --> 58:42.440
So I could kill them or double agent style?

58:42.440 --> 58:46.160
Yes. You could also, if they kill you,

58:46.160 --> 58:48.120
that also works in your advantage,

58:48.120 --> 58:50.040
but you typically don't want it.

58:50.040 --> 58:51.920
You don't want someone else to be there

58:51.920 --> 58:53.560
because then they'll know the secret,

58:53.560 --> 58:57.480
and if they get away having known that, then you're fucked.

58:57.520 --> 59:01.080
The third way is that Silas Cole, you know now,

59:01.080 --> 59:03.160
that Silas Cole is chanting

59:03.160 --> 59:05.320
and will continue to chant the spell

59:05.320 --> 59:08.480
that after a couple rounds will open up a portal

59:08.480 --> 59:11.960
in the floor of this room, the middle room of this house.

59:11.960 --> 59:14.840
You know that there is a back room, which is the kitchen,

59:14.840 --> 59:16.600
a front room, which is the living room,

59:16.600 --> 59:18.920
and then the middle room, which is your guys' bedroom,

59:18.920 --> 59:22.920
and the portal can be in front of both doors

59:22.920 --> 59:24.520
on one side of the room.

59:24.520 --> 59:25.600
And it's in the bedroom?

59:25.600 --> 59:29.840
Yeah, so if they come in too quickly and they fail a check.

59:29.840 --> 59:30.960
They get portaled.

59:30.960 --> 59:32.560
This technicolor portal.

59:32.560 --> 59:33.400
Okay, sweet.

59:33.400 --> 59:35.680
So those are your options.

59:35.680 --> 59:37.560
I like my options here.

59:37.560 --> 59:39.240
Okay, and it's gonna be their turn,

59:39.240 --> 59:40.760
so I'm gonna let them choose what happens next.

59:40.760 --> 59:43.680
Okay, are we still doing, this is still one episode?

59:43.680 --> 59:45.640
Oh shit, how long have we been playing?

59:45.640 --> 59:50.640
