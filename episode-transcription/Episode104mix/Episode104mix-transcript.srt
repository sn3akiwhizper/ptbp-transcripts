1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
What is boiling, my dumplings?

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,900
It's your chef de cuisine, Wolf the dog.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,480
And I am pinching dough like a mad dog

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,300
so I can provide sustenance to all my glorious fans.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,100
Hope y'all like that boiled dough with some mayonnaise inside.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,100
And I am cooking it up live from 694.2 PTBP,

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,140
the only radio station to win a Michelin star by force.

8
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,920
This episode's Howlin' with Wolf is from at Sis Fordman

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,520
from Maryland, who tweeted about the show

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,420
and tagged that pretending pod,

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,020
the sixth best thing you can do with your fingers.

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,780
They write, the network has been compromised,

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,180
root access granted.

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,580
The reality we know or knew is DDoSed

15
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,780
and held by dark matter.

16
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,300
All bow, the new pseudo is here.

17
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,420
This exploit is sticking around.

18
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,420
Patch Tuesday, kernel panic.

19
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,460
Your disk is spinning fast and you can't dump the RAM.

20
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,780
Unplug yourself and pray.

21
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,040
Silas Cole is here to fuck up your day.

22
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,780
Sis admin, what the fuck did you just make me read?

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,460
If this is about computers again,

24
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,300
I'm going to be so fucking pissed off.

25
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,340
Remember, if you want to write up something

26
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,160
for your cream filled doughy wolf to how,

27
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,700
tag at pretending pod on the internet

28
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,300
or write a five star review on Apple podcasts, please.

29
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,240
If you're one of the blessed angels or demons

30
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,420
who make a post, forget the om,

31
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,600
I just want to say T Hanks, thanks.

32
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,600
I don't want to be cast away in a green mile of thick woods

33
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,200
solely-ing the forest with my gump.

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,140
I want to be big.

35
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,120
Now onto the next thing I do.

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,640
It's time for the news of the world.

37
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,300
Last time, Don D. Pettymore was confronted

38
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,160
with the fact that his nephew is a non-human being

39
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,480
that currently resides inside its own daddy,

40
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,920
Don's brother.

41
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,000
This was after John, as always, forgot

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,640
that not everyone already understands his current condition.

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,960
Jack explained, he was searching

44
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,060
for the door out of this place.

45
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,600
Keith promised Leo they'd come back for him

46
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,920
to take him away from this existence.

47
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,040
Don admitted he came to this plane through his Nike bag,

48
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,140
the same one he used as Agent Victor

49
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,680
to dispose of an unnatural rotary phone

50
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,460
that supposedly healed anyone of anything.

51
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,560
John gained a new understanding of his abilities

52
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,640
in this setting, and he dissipated an opening

53
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,480
into the wall of this junk room

54
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,680
where Keith claimed a rope bridge connected

55
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,960
and led to a second stilted bunker.

56
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,440
The group decided to call the number of the rotary phone,

57
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,800
and they heard a ring from across the oily,

58
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,880
colorful bridge inside this duplicate fort.

59
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,760
The entire party witnessed a dreadful sight

60
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,360
as Keith, Don, and Jack all walked out

61
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,920
onto the Bridge of Spies.

62
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,640
Boom, another Tom Hanks reference at the buzzer.

63
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,120
Now listen here.

64
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,360
No, closer, closer.

65
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,360
Get incredibly close so this one is extremely loud.

66
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,840
This track is in a league of its own.

67
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,040
It's Dragon in Three with What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?

68
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,040
["What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?" by Dragon in Three plays in the background.]

69
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,960
Bad girls on top of the water

70
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,160
Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline

71
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,240
Leaving my mind at your altar

72
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,900
Crossing the double line, doing it every time

73
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,900
Tell me what kind of world are you livin' in?

74
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,700
What kind of world are you livin' in?

75
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,900
Hello, everybody out there pretending to be listening.

76
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,580
We're pretending to be people,

77
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,580
and you are getting ready for another crazy episode.

78
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,060
My name is Zach, and I am your handler,

79
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,220
not your best friend, not your dad,

80
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,980
not your Dungeon Master, just giving you the handler,

81
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,860
handler, hand, handy, giving you, handle, hand,

82
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,740
I'm the hand, I'm here with my second, third, fourth,

83
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,740
and 17th best friends, and how are you guys doing?

84
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,540
Am I 17?

85
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,900
If you have to ask.

86
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,620
I'm doing okay, how are you doing, Zach?

87
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,980
Yeah, I'm doing pretty good.

88
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,140
I'm really sad.

89
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,980
Oh, no.

90
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,700
I was trying to cover it up

91
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,820
by really being over-hyped in the intro, but...

92
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,620
Bud, what's got you down?

93
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,620
My butt turned green.

94
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,460
Oh!

95
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,980
Your butt turned green?

96
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,820
You hate to hear it.

97
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,020
Yeah, the whole thing.

98
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,980
Is it mad?

99
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,100
It's jealous.

100
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,700
My ass is green with envy.

101
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,380
Who's it jealous of, or what is it jealous of?

102
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,060
Apples.

103
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,460
How many apples could you fit in there?

104
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,780
Inside or just within the cheeks?

105
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,660
Because I think just within the cheeks I could get two,

106
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,380
but I don't think any are going in my actual asshole.

107
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,260
Oh, standing up for sure, I mean.

108
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,860
Yeah, wow.

109
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,260
I don't think I could get any

110
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,540
unless I could use the stem,

111
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,980
and the stem was nice and long.

112
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,500
Like an apple tree branch filled with mini apples.

113
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,740
You could just drag them along like a dog.

114
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,100
Can I bite the apple into a shape

115
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,660
that might be more fitting?

116
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,380
As long as you put the whole thing in you,

117
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,380
you can slice it up.

118
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,220
Okay.

119
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,260
Okay.

120
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,100
Do I get to eat it after-

121
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,820
Any part you slice off does have to go up there.

122
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,780
Yeah, the whole thing has to.

123
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,660
You guys know when you're eating an apple

124
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,660
and you bite down where the skin meets the flesh,

125
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,100
like the inside, and the skin just goes right up

126
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,220
in between your teeth?

127
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,060
That's awful.

128
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,900
No.

129
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,300
Yeah, try not to think about that

130
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,740
with your butt instead of your mouth, huh?

131
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,460
But your butt doesn't have teeth, though.

132
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,220
I'm doing this new thing where I say, huh?

133
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,900
I like that new thing you're doing, Zach.

134
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,740
Huh?

135
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,060
Your butt doesn't have teeth.

136
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,020
This is a good introduction to the podcast.

137
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,860
Again, right up on that microphone.

138
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,060
Thomas, I can't hear your sadness

139
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,180
if you don't get up on that.

140
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,180
I'm sad about the way you chose to start the podcast.

141
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,060
Do you have a better, do you have an idea?

142
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,940
Yeah, it could just be our normal bullshit,

143
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,100
but maybe you don't talk about shoving apples up your ass.

144
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,940
I don't know.

145
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,060
I didn't start that.

146
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,100
Yeah, it all happened so quick,

147
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,500
no one knows who started it.

148
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,260
Isn't talking about shoving apples up our assholes

149
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,580
exactly what our normal intros are like?

150
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,540
We've probably already done this one.

151
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,420
Okay, what do you want to talk about

152
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,660
putting up our buttholes?

153
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,060
Well, I don't know if you guys have heard

154
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,660
about the fuck barrel, but.

155
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,460
Save it for the den of sin, baby, save it.

156
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,460
Patreon people know what the fuck barrel is all about.

157
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,300
Yeah, they do.

158
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,340
Are they gonna have early access to buy it

159
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,300
before the general public?

160
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,740
They're gonna have a lot of access.

161
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,660
Oh, hell yeah.

162
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,620
Ah, the bridge, I jump off the bridge.

163
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,780
Back to safety.

164
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,580
Ah, the bridge.

165
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,540
Take it to the bridge.

166
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:41,580
Like the last episode ended on a bit of a cliffhanger.

167
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,620
And so first I need stealth roles.

168
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,100
Yes, slight pun intended, I suppose.

169
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,780
I need stealth roles from Clark Bishop

170
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,220
and John Lee Kevinmore because they were trying

171
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:00,220
to avoid being seen by a pair of children,

172
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,900
the Littles, Aiden and Alice,

173
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,900
who they had one interaction with previously.

174
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,940
Yeah, we got them sucked up into this world through a vacuum.

175
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,740
Am I close enough to hear him say this?

176
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,980
No, this is his own internal narration

177
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,980
as he has reminded himself.

178
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,700
Yes, he's reminded himself as he expertly avoids

179
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,580
identification by these children with a 39 on a 50.

180
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,540
Oh, well done.

181
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,820
Unfortunately, Clark is like peeking his head out

182
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,340
and like, what, what are we trying to avoid being seen by?

183
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,940
Cause he rolled a 65 on a 30.

184
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,420
Hey, look, it's those kids.

185
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,540
Hey, look over there and he's pointing.

186
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,020
Aiden and Alice Little are looking back up at Clark Bishop,

187
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,620
who's hanging out, hanging out Beatles style

188
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,140
of this doorway.

189
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,060
And they both give you the,

190
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,980
who's the meet the Fokker's dad?

191
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,820
Robert De Niro.

192
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,540
Yeah, yeah, that's what I know him from best.

193
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,500
He's giving you the best, like Robert De Niro,

194
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,340
pointing two fingers at their eyes,

195
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,180
these little twin children eyes,

196
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,540
and then pointing those same two fingers

197
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,580
right up at Clark Bishop.

198
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,800
John Lee Pettymore still has Clark's compact

199
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,100
and he's like watching that over his shoulder.

200
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,460
And that, well, that's exactly, he just gives a big woo.

201
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,460
How old are the kids?

202
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,460
Oh, they're children.

203
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,600
Okay, that's as specific as you got.

204
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,700
Yeah, I don't think I ever said maybe like

205
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,940
anywhere between 10 and 12, so 11.

206
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,900
Sigh.

207
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,580
Damn, that's getting into like capable rascal territory.

208
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,660
I was picturing way more, like these are,

209
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:04,020
these might be like pretty crafty little bastards.

210
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,300
And I was kind of picturing like much younger children

211
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,700
that we could just kind of, you know,

212
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,660
push off the bridge or something, but.

213
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,260
Ah, 11's normal.

214
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,660
I'm really glad, I'm really glad they didn't see me.

215
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,000
They are standing on a boat.

216
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,940
Did you say they're both little?

217
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,540
That's funny, because their last name is Little.

218
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,420
So the boat that is made of this inky darkness

219
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,940
that's super colorful has been written on

220
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,620
with the shimmering silver sea seemingly.

221
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,580
There are shiny numbers all over the whole of the boat

222
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,980
and it is the numbers that spell overseer.

223
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,120
And the figurehead of the vessel is a young man

224
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,820
with curly black hair who Don seemingly recognized.

225
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,540
You could see it in his eyes.

226
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,540
And I mean, this dude is being melted continuously

227
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,140
about from the waist down as he's halfway in the water

228
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,800
and his mouth has been steeled shut as well.

229
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
And he's just like.

230
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,600
He's just crying and screaming out in endless pain.

231
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,040
And Julie Maxwell was wearing a hospital gown.

232
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,140
Couldn't help but notice when I said

233
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,480
that she had a massive gash running down her forehead,

234
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,560
Thomas was cackling a little bit.

235
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,320
Before you said running down her forehead,

236
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,280
there was a pretty big pause when you just said

237
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,120
she has a massive gash and it made me laugh.

238
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,120
Running down her forehead in between her eyes.

239
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,720
Her nose is missing and she smiles with no teeth

240
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,200
or lips on one full side of her face.

241
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,280
You think doo-doo her face being smashed.

242
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,320
Hey, Zach, you just said doo-doo.

243
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,920
Doo-doo her face smash.

244
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,760
I don't have to pile on that particular theme,

245
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,720
but what's this about her doo-doo gash?

246
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,960
Jesus Christ.

247
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,800
She is missing like half of her face

248
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,480
and that side that is missing the teeth and lips has an eye.

249
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,600
There's an eyeball there.

250
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,840
That part isn't missing,

251
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,600
but across her face on the other orbital socket,

252
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,400
if you're at home, don't Google orbital socket

253
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,440
or orbital socket oozing.

254
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,840
But this one is oozing with this dark substance

255
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,320
is pouring out.

256
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,320
Okay, so her head snaps forward

257
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,440
and a metal sphere climbs out

258
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,440
like a massive spidery tendrilly metal thing

259
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,960
just like pulls itself up out of the body of Julie Maxwell

260
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,800
and continues to hold that body

261
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,960
at the end of one of its tendrils

262
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,240
as one of the other ones lashes out

263
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,240
and rips at the bridge that Keith Bishop.

264
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,360
Nope.

265
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,200
You gave it away.

266
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,760
You gave away the big secret

267
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,040
we've been keeping this whole time.

268
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,480
We were all brothers, carnival brothers.

269
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,640
I'm my own grandpa.

270
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,160
In this world, all it takes to get married

271
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,160
is to share a microwaved meal on the same recliner.

272
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,400
So you guys are technically married.

273
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,320
Okay, so this thing just like it plants

274
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,760
some of its legs down into the boat

275
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,560
and then one of them rips out at this rope bridge

276
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,200
that's made out of this same dark and colorful material

277
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,120
and Keith beans and Jack Russell

278
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,800
and who is the third person who is out on that bridge?

279
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,720
Oh, that's right.

280
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,920
It's Don D fucking Pettymore.

281
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,440
The three of you are out on this bridge.

282
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,440
What are you doing as the metal tendril rips down

283
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,440
in between the three of you

284
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,960
and this stilted room that Clark Bishop

285
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,120
and John Lee Kevin Moore are inside?

286
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,680
How far away are we?

287
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,040
Okay, so the bridge is 10 yards

288
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,760
and you're about five yards into it.

289
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,920
You're like exactly halfway.

290
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,520
Also, give me your dexterity.

291
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,200
Mine is 55.

292
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,040
Same.

293
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,880
I got a 60.

294
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,800
60 as well.

295
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Okay, so we'll do the order is Keith, Clark, Don, John.

296
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,200
Don John.

297
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,040
Don John.

298
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,080
Great movie.

299
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,360
Oh yeah, you love film?

300
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,320
Yeah, I guess you could say I'm a cinema enthusiast.

301
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,640
Don John is probably my favorite.

302
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,560
Just has a lot to say.

303
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,960
Not a lot of people get it.

304
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,960
Not a lot of people get it,

305
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,520
but it actually has a lot of really insightful things to say

306
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,920
kind of turns the whole gender thing on its head.

307
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,760
It's real subtle.

308
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,120
And Joseph Gordon-Levitt was the white man to do that.

309
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,640
Yeah, that was actually Joseph Gordon-Levitt

310
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,880
the whole time, which is crazy.

311
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,360
Oh wait, he was Don John?

312
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,720
Yes, the whole time.

313
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,840
Oh, cool.

314
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,840
See, like I said, you always find out new things

315
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,680
about that movie.

316
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,120
So if you consider yourself a film buff,

317
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,080
check out Don John.

318
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,320
All the stunts in the movie, he did for the most part.

319
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,160
That's crazy.

320
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,440
He actually cleaned an apartment as a man?

321
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,280
Yeah.

322
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,520
He did not have a stunt double.

323
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,360
Wow.

324
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,960
Keith, you are in the middle of this rope ridge.

325
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,960
Five yards to your left is the second large stilted room

326
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,360
that you have not been to.

327
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,640
There's a hatch that is just right there, five yards away.

328
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,400
And five yards on your right, on the other side,

329
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,280
you see this John made hole

330
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,880
and you see John kind of hiding.

331
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,840
His back is turned.

332
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,400
He's looking through a compact

333
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,960
as Clark is hanging his head out

334
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,280
and kind of waving at some children who are on this boat.

335
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,480
What do you do?

336
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,200
Above 50, I jumped to the hatch.

337
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,640
Below 50, I jumped back to the John made hole.

338
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,520
87, I jumped to the hatch.

339
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,680
Okay, make a dexterity.

340
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,560
10 on a 60.

341
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,920
Well done, well done.

342
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,000
Okay, fantastic.

343
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,040
So you are running, running, running

344
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,480
as this bridge is falling out beneath you

345
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,760
and you are going to be able to make a leap

346
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,720
without falling to your likely demise.

347
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,560
Good thing you passed that rule.

348
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,400
Oh yeah, good thing.

349
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,440
Clark, what are you doing?

350
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,960
So the bridge is collapsing

351
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,280
from the point that I'm standing, right?

352
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,120
Correct.

353
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,840
Like the bridge part that is nearest you is going to fall.

354
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,600
You're not sure whether or not it will go into the water

355
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,440
but if I said earlier that the bridge is 10 yards long

356
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,440
and from one of the stilted hatch doors of the room

357
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,320
down to the shining, shimmering, shiver sea,

358
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,680
I think I said that was maybe 10 yards, 15 yards,

359
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,680
but it definitely wasn't less than 10 yards.

360
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,680
And so if you're like holding onto the rope bridge

361
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,440
then you'll probably be safe from falling into the not ocean.

362
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,400
But I'm not on the bridge itself though, right?

363
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,240
I'm still in this.

364
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,080
Certainly not.

365
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,560
No, I was just trying to give you an idea

366
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,000
of like what it looks like as it's happening.

367
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,840
So I don't, yeah.

368
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,160
I mean, I don't think I have an action here.

369
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,880
I want to stay on this side of the place

370
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,000
because I'm thinking about the boat

371
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,180
that is still docked on our side.

372
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,860
He's not going to like run out there.

373
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,780
I guess, oh, we're in a room filled with junk, right?

374
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,380
Yes.

375
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,120
I'll see if anything catches my eye

376
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,700
that could be helpful in this situation.

377
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,700
Maybe like bed sheets or something.

378
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,740
I don't know.

379
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,580
100%.

380
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,980
I rolled a 50 on a search and that's not good.

381
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,580
I've got a 20 in search.

382
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:15,260
Okay, so as you're looking through, you find pillowcases.

383
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:21,860
It's like bedsheets, but worse.

384
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,500
It's worse than what you were looking for.

385
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,340
These'll work.

386
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,980
Don D. Pettymore, you're up.

387
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,980
Don D. Pettymore is going to like scramble

388
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,380
because the one we were going to

389
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,980
is where the telephone was ringing, correct?

390
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,820
That is correct.

391
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,020
And that is where Keith is like sprinting towards

392
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,700
very like agilely running across this bridge

393
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,780
that is currently falling.

394
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,580
Yeah, I will also like scramble that way.

395
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,260
Okay, roll dexterity or athletics.

396
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,700
Oh, my athletic, nope.

397
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,100
Dexterity it is.

398
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,380
Oh my God.

399
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,980
I got a 54 out of 55.

400
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,540
Oh, oh shit.

401
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,620
Okay, fantastic.

402
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:12,340
So you are going to be able to make the jump as well.

403
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,820
At the beginning of your next turn,

404
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,620
you're going to be able to make that jump.

405
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,940
John, you see Clark digging through

406
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,700
and finding pillowcases.

407
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,660
What are you doing?

408
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,180
How close is the boat to us?

409
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,180
And specifically the John Mayhole?

410
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,500
Picture it like a triangle.

411
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,980
You are 10 yards away from the hatch that is across

412
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,760
and then you are 10 yards away from the boat

413
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,660
that is an equilateral triangle.

414
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,460
I see that everybody else who's out there on the bridge

415
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,300
is currently running to the other bunker, correct?

416
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,900
Yeah, Jack Russell hasn't gone yet.

417
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,100
So he hasn't moved

418
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,300
because that's how games work in real life too.

419
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,380
But the other two are certainly running away from you.

420
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,420
John, just I want to just start like closing

421
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,420
the John Mayhole.

422
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,540
Rad, oh shit.

423
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,020
Okay, roll unnatural.

424
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,820
39 on a?

425
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,460
More than that.

426
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,980
More than that.

427
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,740
One of these days you're going to fail that roll.

428
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,460
Oh, there I see it, 67.

429
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,460
Describe it.

430
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,760
He looks like he's frantically like trying to mop up a mess

431
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,260
with his hands.

432
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,440
He doesn't make like a good or like,

433
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,780
it doesn't look like a manmade solid wall

434
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,580
like it might have before.

435
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,340
You can actually see like his fingerprints and stuff

436
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:42,180
as he just like quickly goo-clayed it back into solid.

437
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,220
That's super cool, I can picture it.

438
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,980
And he leaves a tiny little peephole

439
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,940
so they can see what's going on.

440
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,740
Incredible, incredible.

441
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,620
Okay, so as you're looking through this tiny little peephole

442
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,520
you're probably the only one who sees Jack Russell.

443
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,860
I'm going to do the same roll that Luke did,

444
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,940
above 50 goes towards them,

445
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,940
under 50 tries to go back where he came from,

446
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,820
which is now closed.

447
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,000
I rolled a 94.

448
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,140
And so he's going to take off running

449
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,540
to follow Keith and Dawn, and he rolls a 10.

450
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:23,280
So Jack Russell is going to run along.

451
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,140
So the three of you, picture it like,

452
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,900
I'm picturing a Wes Anderson framing of this scene

453
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,700
because it's very flat, you know.

454
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,260
You've got this endless background behind you,

455
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,500
but then you have two identical stilted rooms

456
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,260
on either side of the frame,

457
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,620
10 yards above this silver sea

458
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,900
that just goes on endlessly into the background.

459
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,780
And then there's a bridge hanging in the middle.

460
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:53,140
Jack, Dawn, and Keith are sprinting to the right

461
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,660
as the bridge collapses from the left.

462
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,340
And as they run, the three of them kind of jump out.

463
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,100
And I'm picturing kind of a railing

464
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,100
going around the outside on this one maybe.

465
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,220
And so Keith is able to make the leap

466
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,500
and hopefully grab on.

467
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,500
So Keith, go ahead and roll as you see behind you,

468
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:24,900
this giant ball after it crashes down.

469
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,580
John, you can see this too

470
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,340
through your thimble sized hole.

471
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,180
Little smaller.

472
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,260
Oh, I got tiny thimbles, dude.

473
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,380
And so.

474
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,140
I just don't want your spider thing

475
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,540
poking one of its legs through it.

476
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,820
I'm trying to head off that eventuality.

477
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,460
You're not gonna tell me how big my hole was.

478
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,300
How many apples can fit through it.

479
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,660
And so you.

480
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,580
Can you chop them up?

481
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,420
We can talk about that.

482
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,180
I'm pretending to be people after dark.

483
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:00,860
These metal tendrils move into the shimmering sea.

484
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,980
They're planting themselves into this silvery ocean

485
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,860
and you hear a noise.

486
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:16,380
And you see these tendrils are all the same texture.

487
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,980
It's this shiny, shiny metal.

488
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,340
It's like the same texture,

489
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,620
but a solid of the ocean that is out there.

490
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,180
And you hear this like.

491
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:40,780
And you think that it is coming from the ball.

492
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,420
It is like reverberating this noise

493
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,540
through the world that you're in.

494
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:49,100
Does it sound like a person going re re re re re re re re

495
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,420
or is it actually like metallic sounds?

496
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,460
It is metallic sounding.

497
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:59,460
However, it does sound like the vocalizations of an entity.

498
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,140
Can you roll intelligence for me?

499
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,060
Can I roll on that?

500
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,820
Yeah.

501
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,660
Since I'm looking out the window.

502
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,780
I failed a 60 on a 55.

503
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:16,740
I passed a 54 on a 60 or 75.

504
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,340
John, as you're actually looking at this thing,

505
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,020
you're seeing it's like kind of stilted movements

506
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,900
of the ball as this noise is coming out of it seemingly.

507
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,900
Not only do you realize that even in ball form,

508
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:36,580
you would still be able to speak and vocalize

509
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,260
just like this thing is.

510
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,300
And it might sound like a little metallic,

511
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,660
but it would be your voice.

512
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:47,660
And this thing's voice sounds animalistic

513
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,140
and taking that idea one step further,

514
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,140
you think that this ball might've been inside an animal

515
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,500
for the past, who knows how long.

516
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,580
It's the raccoon.

517
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,660
And that's why it speaks like this.

518
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,300
Holy shit.

519
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,860
It's a feral ball.

520
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,740
Yeah, it's a rabid ball.

521
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,900
That's so dope.

522
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,780
Yeah, so John like looks back at Clark

523
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,180
who's frantically gathering pillowcases, I guess.

524
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,780
And he's like, quick update, door's closed.

525
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,900
We got a peephole.

526
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,100
That ball is some kind of feral ball.

527
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,980
So we probably don't need these pillowcases then.

528
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,220
I don't really know where I was going with that anyway.

529
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,140
And he drops it.

530
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,460
I mean, it can't hurt.

531
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,980
Oh, okay.

532
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,500
Gather some back up.

533
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,140
Find a Sharpie in here.

534
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,500
You could draw a little face on it.

535
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,980
And then that could be your mask from those kids.

536
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,820
You know, you give it like glasses and grumpy eyebrows

537
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,380
and a big beard, and then it won't look like Clark.

538
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,220
They're kids.

539
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,580
They wouldn't know.

540
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,420
Exactly.

541
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,500
They're stupid idiots.

542
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,300
Yeah, they're just a couple morons, you know?

543
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,140
So.

544
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,980
Keith, roll athletics or dexterity

545
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,220
in order to reach out and grab.

546
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,060
93.

547
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,020
Ooh.

548
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,300
On what though?

549
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,340
A 60.

550
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,180
Oh.

551
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,580
On a hundred.

552
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,300
Good thing I have a hundred decks.

553
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,460
You know how jacked Keith is.

554
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,620
You know, yeah, you know how Keith

555
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,740
was always darting off to the Olympics.

556
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,300
Every four years, he was really busy.

557
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,420
I know this isn't the rules,

558
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,900
but can I do a saving throw?

559
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,180
Fuck yeah.

560
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,460
Uh, no.

561
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,460
So you fall.

562
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,380
He could spend luck.

563
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,460
Oh.

564
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,300
I don't.

565
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,780
Ooh, well, how much luck do I have?

566
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,580
That would be a lot of luck, huh?

567
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,420
Is it?

568
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,260
It's not luck.

569
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,340
Luck doesn't start over with the new sheet, does it?

570
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,180
Ha!

571
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,460
Okay, you begin falling.

572
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,300
Do you want to describe it?

573
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,740
Yeah, I am running along the bridge

574
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,340
and then obviously start to lose footing.

575
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:03,220
And I like jump and I smack my arms

576
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,380
on where like the railing is.

577
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,340
This room is hot.

578
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,100
This area is pretty hot, right?

579
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,940
Cause of the melted ocean.

580
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,700
We've not talked about the temperature.

581
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,340
Well, how would you describe the temperature in this room?

582
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,060
It is exactly room temperature.

583
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,460
Oh, well I'm just sweaty cause I'm nervous

584
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,180
and my hands hit the bars.

585
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,660
I grab on just for a second,

586
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,860
like try to pull myself up and then slip off

587
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,300
and start falling.

588
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,340
So John looking through the peephole

589
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,700
relays that back to Clark.

590
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,460
He's like, Clark, you know how every time you go

591
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,180
to shake Vigna's hands, they're a little bit sweaty?

592
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,260
Right, yeah, of course.

593
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,860
Well, that just got the best of him.

594
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,460
We might have to open this hole back up.

595
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,020
He slipped off the bridge there.

596
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,180
Is he in the molten?

597
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,620
Is he in the sea?

598
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,440
Is he gone?

599
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,980
He's slowly falling towards it as you guys are talking.

600
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,540
It seems like he's almost moving in slow motion.

601
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,940
We're just waiting for an action to be taken.

602
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,020
I'm never gonna like tell you to not talk,

603
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,420
you know, in character.

604
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,020
It's like, it's always what I want.

605
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,320
So I'm never gonna cut you off.

606
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,660
Just imagine that it's happening really fast

607
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,700
and everything else action wise, very slow.

608
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,500
So John, what's your theory about what's going on here?

609
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,340
Exactly.

610
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,740
I'm glad you asked that actually.

611
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,180
I've got no fucking clue, man.

612
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,900
I was gonna ask.

613
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,420
I will cut you off.

614
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,740
Clark Bishop, it's your turn.

615
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,380
What do you do?

616
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,000
I mean, I got nothing.

617
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,920
I mean, can I keep searching for a thing

618
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,100
that's 10 yards long?

619
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,380
I don't know how to save a guy

620
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,300
that's falling 10 yards away from me.

621
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:45,300
Hey, Joe, you probably don't know how to save someone

622
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,860
far away, huh?

623
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,820
Yeah.

624
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,100
Remember guys how I'm doing the huh thing?

625
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,940
Huh?

626
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,700
How to save a life.

627
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,860
Huh?

628
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,820
Huh?

629
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,580
So yeah, Keith is in the fray falling down

630
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:03,580
and Clark is looking through.

631
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,820
Man, you could really, I mean, a cable car would be able to.

632
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,020
Here's what I wanna do.

633
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,700
I wanna look for something big and flat

634
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,180
that might float down there

635
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,020
and I could try and throw it under Keith

636
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,320
to like stop his fall.

637
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,640
This is, I don't know, a multi-roll maneuver maybe.

638
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,260
Not one, it's an odd one.

639
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,180
No way.

640
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,260
It's an odd one.

641
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,180
The green dice or what I?

642
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,580
Fuck yes, dude.

643
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,800
Hell yes, dude.

644
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,140
Joe just always has one set of dice

645
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:44,140
sitting on an odd one so that he can squeeze the camera down.

646
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,720
I've been waiting for two years for this.

647
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,820
Fuck yes, dude.

648
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,700
Okay, cool.

649
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,740
Well, what do you find?

650
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,300
What's the perfect item?

651
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,760
An old door is what I came to mind.

652
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,860
I'm picturing Titanic.

653
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:03,540
I don't wanna throw this lifeboat of a door down there.

654
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,140
Fuck yeah, you find an old door.

655
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,900
It looks really light.

656
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,260
I hold it up and show John.

657
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,180
John, what you gonna do?

658
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,860
And I'm trying to motion that I'm wanting to throw it out.

659
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,540
If you start throwing it at the end of your turn,

660
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:21,180
I will, at the start of my turn, open up the door again

661
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,620
and hope to time it right so it just sails right on through.

662
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,460
John says that with his eyes

663
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,760
and so Clark begins throwing.

664
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,240
Thomas just looked into the camera with big eyes.

665
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,740
Man, this is such a cool idea.

666
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,060
It's a shame Keith's gonna fall right into the water

667
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,620
at the beginning of his next turn.

668
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,420
All right, so it is Dawn's turn.

669
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,300
Am I rolling to grab?

670
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,820
Yeah, yeah, or whatever you wanna do.

671
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,820
You see Keith ahead of you as slipping and falling.

672
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:01,760
Are you gonna just grab two-handed onto the railing?

673
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,260
Can I do a special maneuver right now?

674
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,660
I love it when you ask that.

675
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,620
I consent.

676
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:11,460
Don D. Pattymore seeing this Keith fella

677
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,180
falling in front of him,

678
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,240
I guess in slow motion as I'm also jumping.

679
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,020
Like I love thinking of, it's very anime of us

680
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,700
to have all of us thinking very complete sentences

681
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,980
and all this action's happening.

682
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:29,420
Having full conversations somehow in a two-second span.

683
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,720
He starts chanting to himself,

684
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,720
vis-a-girl, vis-a-girl, vis-a-girl,

685
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,220
over and over again.

686
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,840
Okay, go ahead and roll dexterity to grab on.

687
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,680
Oh my God.

688
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,780
You got a 24 on a 55.

689
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,860
Oh, hell yeah.

690
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,580
Do you wanna describe grabbing onto this railing, Justin?

691
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,300
Yeah, I just, well.

692
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,140
I fuckin' grab it.

693
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,740
Yeah, I fuckin' grab it, bro.

694
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,840
I do what Keith did except I succeed.

695
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,900
And I light a cigarette in my mouth while I'm doing it.

696
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,940
In slow motion.

697
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,020
Okay, rad.

698
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,560
Jon, roll a natural.

699
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,040
Jon compelled as if,

700
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,600
it's almost like he's sharing a will with Clark.

701
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,560
He just knows to go to the door

702
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,560
and he rolls a 64 on a 67.

703
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:36,560
And just in time, he slides his hand down the door

704
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,720
and, or down the wall,

705
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,220
and a door-sized slot just opens

706
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,400
right as the door goes flying through.

707
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,640
Oh my God.

708
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,480
Yes.

709
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,600
Fucking incredible.

710
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,080
I am not gonna lie,

711
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,440
I was very much looking forward to Clark

712
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,160
just throwing a door into the wall.

713
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,280
Yeah, exactly.

714
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,320
What'd you do that for, Clark?

715
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,400
No, this is great, this is great.

716
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,560
I'm glad you guys are succeeding, I guess.

717
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,960
That, I mean, yeah, you've never seen Jon's eyes so big

718
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,300
and he's just staring at Clark in disbelief.

719
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,360
As this door flies through this little door-sized slot

720
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:21,360
in the wall and begins making its way down to the water

721
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,240
under Keith Vigna, Jack Russell is going to roll a naught 7

722
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,680
and he grabs on directly next to,

723
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:36,680
it's like we get another shot of what just happened

724
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,440
of the three men running and jumping

725
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,560
where Keith goes, hits, falls, and immediately,

726
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,660
Don grabs, and then immediately,

727
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,080
Jack Russell grabs right next to Don

728
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,660
and so the two of them are hanging from this railing.

729
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,420
Jack Russell is just pulling himself up,

730
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,440
going, oh, this is fucking shit.

731
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,520
And he's trying to pull himself up

732
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,760
and Don is a chancy, chancy boy.

733
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,380
Below the ball, you see these two twins,

734
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,000
one with a bowl cut, the other one with a pig tail.

735
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,960
They're running overalls.

736
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:17,560
And each of them has a massive smile on their face

737
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:22,560
and they reach into their little pockets in their overalls

738
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,860
and they each pull out a lollipop.

739
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,720
I think I just pissed myself.

740
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,280
That was scary.

741
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,680
Can you imagine?

742
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:44,360
Behind the ball, it's tendrils finding support

743
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:49,360
in the silvery, shimmery sea,

744
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,680
making this weird like,

745
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,960
noise is going to fling some of the melting steel

746
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,020
with one of its tendrils.

747
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,840
It's going to splash.

748
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,920
And it rolled a 23, like Michael Jordan.

749
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,600
You'd never wanted to get in the pool with Michael,

750
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,560
all time greatest splasher.

751
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,920
He could do the thing where he puts his hands

752
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,400
and squeezes them and it shoots right at your face.

753
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,800
You know what I'm talking about?

754
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,440
I do, my dad did that shit all the time.

755
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,140
Michael Jordan was the Scottie Pippen of doing that.

756
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,880
The splash is timed perfectly.

757
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,320
And this door made out of this black texture,

758
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,200
this colorful black texture flying perfectly

759
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,600
through the air to save Keith Vigna

760
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:48,600
from falling into this metal gets completely engulfed.

761
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:54,080
This melting steel wraps itself around this door

762
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,680
and it is no longer the liquid that it was previously.

763
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,680
It is now a metal door and the metal door falls,

764
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,480
hits the ocean and begins sinking as Keith Vigna falls.

765
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,280
Keith, your feet hit first.

766
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,480
I was going to say, is there any way

767
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,000
that my cargo shorts could act as parachutes

768
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,160
in this crazy world we're in right now

769
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,880
to slow my fall just a little bit?

770
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,620
In this crazy messed up world we're in.

771
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,840
He can't tell if that's better than the fact

772
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,340
that he was about to kill you.

773
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,580
Let's take a vote, Joe, Thomas, Justin.

774
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,920
If the cargo shorts can become parachutes.

775
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,520
I'll close my eyes so that I don't know who voted for what.

776
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,280
Yeah, put a thumbs up.

777
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,520
Put a thumbs up if you think that Keith touches down

778
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:01,360
into the metal sea and put a thumbs down

779
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,360
if you think parachute shorts.

780
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,800
All right, it's been decided.

781
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,960
Keith, your feet touch first.

782
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,800
Okay.

783
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,920
The pain is unimaginable.

784
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,560
It is the hottest.

785
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,240
It's giving off no temperature change to the air around it

786
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,240
but as your toes dip in, you can't feel anything at all

787
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,360
and your mind goes completely numb

788
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,520
and there's just this piercing noise

789
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,880
going through the back of your head, just this.

790
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:59,040
The shock immediately changes as the rest of you

791
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:04,480
slowly, slowly, agonizingly melts into this ocean.

792
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,720
Up to your knees now, your shins are fully melting.

793
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,040
You don't even know what it would be like

794
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,440
inside of your shorts but you think your legs

795
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,800
might just not even exist anymore.

796
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,400
You're just becoming part of this ocean itself

797
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,560
and your stomach hurts.

798
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,680
Your mouth immediately has the taste of metal

799
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,160
inside of it, blood and metal

800
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,640
and you can smell butter.

801
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,320
Smells like butter?

802
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,680
That's weird.

803
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,680
What do you scream out as your torso begins?

804
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,840
Don, use the phone on me!

805
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,600
Fuck yeah.

806
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:55,600
And you will continue melting in on your next turn

807
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,280
and by the end of your next turn,

808
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,280
you will be fully submerged in the shimmering silver sea.

809
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,280
Clark Bishop, it's your turn.

810
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,680
Clark Bishop, come on down.

811
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,920
Everything going good out there?

812
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,800
Did he land on the door?

813
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,080
That was good timing with you opening up that.

814
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,200
We got him, right?

815
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,000
You know, mission accomplished.

816
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,840
Yeah.

817
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,680
High five me, man.

818
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,640
John, weekly high fives you.

819
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,480
Every week?

820
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,840
This is our weekly high five.

821
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,880
It may or may not be about what just happened with Keith,

822
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,440
which may or may not have been successful.

823
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,520
I may or may not have just seen one of the most

824
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,160
horrific things I could ever hope to imagine

825
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,520
as he may or may not have melted into the ocean.

826
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,000
And Keith is just screaming at the top of his lungs

827
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,440
until it gets to his lungs and then it's just gurgles.

828
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,280
Keith, everyone knows you're in over your head,

829
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,520
over your head.

830
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,440
See, he's so excited that he got caught by the door.

831
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,280
He's so excited.

832
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,640
He's screaming for joy, right?

833
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:10,280
Clark, at the end of the day, it was a great throw.

834
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,400
You did your bit as good as anyone could have asked you,

835
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,880
but unforeseen circumstances came up

836
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,680
and now he's being swallowed into that goo there.

837
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,160
I can smell him cooking from here, actually.

838
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,080
Is that what that butter toast thing is?

839
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,760
Yeah, yeah, that's his blubber.

840
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,080
He was, you know, he was an inside boy.

841
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,040
Not fat, but certainly not fit.

842
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,800
Can we do anything?

843
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,440
Are you telling me that Keith's dead?

844
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,080
No, you can look out the hole.

845
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,440
You can see him dying out there and screaming.

846
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,200
This is still your turn.

847
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,320
So any idea you have is as good as.

848
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,160
We still got time.

849
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,640
We still got time.

850
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,720
Clark is going to search through this magical room

851
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,240
one more time for something long

852
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,520
that he can throw out there to maybe pull him in with.

853
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,480
You find a door.

854
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,760
I've been looking through this room to find helpful things.

855
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,560
God damn it, I can't find anything.

856
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,480
It's an 82.

857
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,280
There's so much junk in here, but it's also useless.

858
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,560
You find a putter.

859
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,240
How about this?

860
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,080
How about this?

861
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:22,920
A putter.

862
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,760
Is it long enough?

863
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,960
You just whang him on the head.

864
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,280
Just hit him in the head.

865
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,800
Don, use the owl.

866
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,160
Phone on me.

867
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,640
All right, good turn.

868
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,960
Don D. Pettymore.

869
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,800
Don is going to continue his chant.

870
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,360
Can you give me that one more time?

871
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:48,360
Biza girl, biza girl, biza girl.

872
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,000
That was three times.

873
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,280
Cause you're special to me.

874
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,480
Thanks number 17.

875
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,320
Damn it.

876
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,720
I don't have 17 friends.

877
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,840
All right, and so.

878
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,960
Yeah, you were all fools to worry.

879
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:12,960
So, Don is hanging.

880
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,800
And as he's hanging, his chant begins reverberating

881
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,040
through this entire place.

882
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,720
You all feel yourselves freeze,

883
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,440
both in space and in time.

884
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,400
As the world begins to rewind.

885
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,400
Oh my God.

886
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,480
You feel yourselves moving backwards,

887
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,840
making the exact same movements,

888
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,960
only this time in reverse.

889
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,320
Clark sets a putter down on the floor

890
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,280
in the piston bunk yard.

891
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,280
Keith screams out.

892
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,120
His legs exist once again.

893
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,800
His stomach is content.

894
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,480
The taste of blood in his mouth vanishes

895
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,800
and the smell of butter melts away.

896
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,200
His feet lift up out of the endless ocean of pain

897
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,520
and the shock dissipates.

898
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,480
A shiny metal door emerges

899
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,520
from out of the shimmering silver sea

900
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,600
and flings off its steel covering

901
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,560
to reveal a colorful black texture.

902
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,880
The little twins put lollipops back in their wrappers

903
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,600
and into their overalls.

904
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,960
The unnaturally hued door sends a spray of liquid metal

905
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,200
toward the feral ball that inhabited Julie Maxwell

906
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,560
and then flies back up into the junkyard bunker

907
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:48,240
just as John closes a hem made hole in the wall.

908
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,800
Clark catches the door and promptly places it

909
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,880
under some junk on the floor.

910
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,160
Keith's body ascends toward the second stilted bunkers hatch

911
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,400
and his sweaty hands grab

912
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,720
and immediately release the railing

913
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,160
as he is thrust backwards onto the rising bridge

914
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,280
and time freezes once again

915
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,800
before suddenly stumbling forward

916
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,080
in its typical intoxicated manner

917
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,440
and Keith leaps toward the hatch,

918
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,800
reaches out for the railing

919
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,880
and we'll hear that roll on the next episode.

920
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,720
Woo.

921
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,160
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

922
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,040
I fail.

923
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,200
Oh well then it just happens again.

924
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,040
Okay.

925
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,440
Oh should I crit fail?

926
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,360
It was a 48 on a 60 just so you know.

927
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,520
Oh then we learn now.

928
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,400
I thought you were just gonna end it right there.

929
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,720
Keith grabs onto the hatch, opens it, grabs the phone,

930
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,480
saves everyone in the world and podcasts over.

931
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,560
I'm glad you wrote that.

932
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,400
Thank you very much.

933
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,220
That's the end.

934
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,060
Good game.

935
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:56,880
That was wild.

936
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,720
That was a great ending.

937
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,560
Good round.

938
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,160
You guys wanna play again?

939
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,440
I do.

940
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,560
Like you mean like season two?

941
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,400
What if we just played this again?

942
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,600
Let's just do this again.

943
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,440
Let's just start.

944
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,560
I bet you guys would do better.

945
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,080
Oh yeah.

946
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,120
Fucking right off the bat.

947
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,960
Maggie, it's your birthday.

948
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,400
You're under arrest.

949
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,400
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
