00:00.000 --> 00:03.080
Greetings, my chubby babies.

00:03.080 --> 00:06.160
It's your thick fat daddy Wolf the dog,

00:06.160 --> 00:08.760
here to slap, lap, and crap

00:08.760 --> 00:12.080
right into your chunky little ear holes.

00:12.080 --> 00:16.100
I, of course, am emanating from the basement.

00:16.100 --> 00:21.100
694.2 PTBP, from the future to the past.

00:22.860 --> 00:26.520
But the past is your present?

00:26.520 --> 00:29.640
I don't know, time travel confuses me,

00:29.640 --> 00:32.040
but I still do it constantly

00:32.040 --> 00:35.760
because it makes my innards feel frisky.

00:35.760 --> 00:38.040
Speaking of frisky business,

00:38.040 --> 00:40.520
this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from

00:40.520 --> 00:44.800
at Shemelan Shmusk, who tweeted about the show

00:44.800 --> 00:46.840
and tagged that pretending pod.

00:46.840 --> 00:48.360
It's that easy, y'all.

00:48.360 --> 00:50.800
They right, hell yeah.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.400
From Adam to Eric,

00:53.400 --> 00:56.720
thank you for letting me know about this podcast.

00:56.760 --> 00:58.360
It made the first few months

00:58.360 --> 01:01.200
of baby Aurelia's life even better.

01:01.200 --> 01:04.780
Recently, I took her to her six month checkup,

01:04.780 --> 01:09.000
and after they gave her her shots, they cut my dick off.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.140
Turns out it's actually pretty common.

01:11.140 --> 01:15.200
We love you all the way from DC, DTF.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.640
Well, Adam and Eric, I hope y'all have fun

01:18.640 --> 01:21.160
running around dickless or whatever.

01:21.160 --> 01:25.240
Do y'all know how they dispose of discarded dongs?

01:25.240 --> 01:30.240
I sure do, and I'll never tell how or why I know

01:30.680 --> 01:35.680
or what kind of wine goes best with a wok-fried wang.

01:36.160 --> 01:38.660
Remember, if you think we deserve it,

01:38.660 --> 01:40.720
spread around some internet love

01:40.720 --> 01:45.000
by tagging at PretendingPod on Twitter and Instagram.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.320

or pledge to help keep this show going

01:50.880 --> 01:55.040
at patreon.com slash PretendingPod.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.920
Also, my producer says the current plan

01:57.920 --> 02:02.400
is to record another Q&A episode for this here main feed

02:02.400 --> 02:04.760
that will be released quite soon,

02:04.760 --> 02:07.280
like maybe next Friday soon.

02:07.280 --> 02:09.360
So head on over to the subreddit

02:09.360 --> 02:13.680

02:13.680 --> 02:17.220
and find the Q&A thread to submit your questions.

02:17.220 --> 02:19.720
Also, feel free to send those questions

02:19.720 --> 02:22.620
to at PretendingPod on Twitter as well.

02:22.620 --> 02:25.000
Me, I'm tired of the past.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.200
It's given me them blues.

02:27.200 --> 02:29.600
Thank fuck this is the last broadcast

02:29.600 --> 02:32.580
I'm blasting out old news.

02:32.580 --> 02:36.760
Last episode, the PCs all signed some sort of paperwork

02:36.760 --> 02:39.360
to partner with the calm, comfy campground

02:39.360 --> 02:42.440
on something called Operation Hole Puncher

02:42.440 --> 02:46.440
in a room filled with the flowers found all over the island.

02:46.440 --> 02:49.000
The memories continued to bounce around,

02:49.000 --> 02:51.480
from a cottage filled with security equipment

02:51.480 --> 02:53.560
to the rounded-off meeting room

02:53.560 --> 02:56.440
dealing with a broad woman and a scrawny man

02:56.440 --> 02:58.180
who were attempting to spray them

02:58.180 --> 03:01.760
with some sort of spray made from the flowers on the island.

03:01.760 --> 03:04.160
Angela, when cornered and confused

03:04.160 --> 03:05.880
by the actions of the group,

03:05.880 --> 03:10.160
began chanting something strange and lost in translation.

03:10.160 --> 03:12.400
With time being all finicky,

03:12.400 --> 03:15.400
I'm assuming this may perhaps be the last time

03:15.400 --> 03:17.660
I'm asked to choose a brand new track

03:17.660 --> 03:20.520
to premiere on this audio cast.

03:20.520 --> 03:24.400
And I've been saving this one for this perfect moment.

03:24.400 --> 03:27.840
I have the distinct pleasure to present to each of you

03:27.840 --> 03:32.680
for the very first time, Dream Girl with Pretty Sexual.

03:35.680 --> 03:38.440
["Pretty Sexual"]

03:38.440 --> 03:41.440
[" Working For You"]

03:41.440 --> 04:03.520
["

04:03.520 --> 04:11.920
Mr. Zach's Wild Bone."

04:11.920 --> 04:15.240
Mr. Zach's Wild Bone.

04:15.240 --> 04:16.240
Is that why...

04:16.240 --> 04:20.520
Even though it won't be in the video.

04:20.520 --> 04:24.240
People are like, what the fuck is this dialogue?

04:24.240 --> 04:26.680
I want to get off Mr. Bone's wild ride.

04:26.680 --> 04:27.680
Hi, Zach.

04:27.680 --> 04:28.680
Hey, Joe.

04:28.680 --> 04:29.680
Hey, Justin.

04:29.680 --> 04:30.680
Go fuck yourself up.

04:30.680 --> 04:31.680
That's nice.

04:31.680 --> 04:32.680
Good burp, Luke.

04:32.840 --> 04:33.840
You're being mean to me, Zach.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.840
Oh, I don't think so, personally.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.200
I personally do think so.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.200
Oh, okay.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.200
Personally.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.840
Could you just give me a rundown of how I've been mean to you?

04:40.840 --> 04:42.840
That way I can better myself?

04:42.840 --> 04:43.840
No.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.840
You called him ugly.

04:45.840 --> 04:47.200
You called him stupid.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.240
You hurt me emotionally.

04:49.240 --> 04:50.440
You have been hitting him a lot.

04:50.440 --> 04:54.360
Yeah, you just punch him in the shoulder like really hard all the time.

04:54.360 --> 05:01.320
These are all fair, but do you have any real ones?

05:01.320 --> 05:02.880
I like when you sit on my chest.

05:02.880 --> 05:06.760
I don't like when you hurt me the other way.

05:06.760 --> 05:11.800
Well, you should say the safe word, which is...

05:11.800 --> 05:12.800
Papa Zechariah.

05:12.800 --> 05:16.480
Oh, that's when I stopped.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.640
Anything referring to me being a father?

05:18.640 --> 05:20.640
No, I'm out.

05:20.640 --> 05:21.640
Dad.

05:21.640 --> 05:22.640
Dad.

05:22.640 --> 05:24.560
Oh, no, dad.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.560
Finish it.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.560
Say daddy.

05:28.560 --> 05:32.120
No, daddy is hot.

05:32.120 --> 05:33.120
Dad is disturbing.

05:33.120 --> 05:36.440
Yeah, that's why I want you to finish it so I can finish.

05:36.440 --> 05:37.440
All right, so...

05:37.440 --> 05:39.440
You're my male father figure.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.880
Oh, okay.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.680
We need to take this all out.

05:44.680 --> 05:45.680
All of it?

05:45.680 --> 05:46.680
Yeah.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.680
Some of it.

05:47.680 --> 05:48.680
Okay, let's start now.

05:48.680 --> 05:49.680
Hey, Zech.

05:49.680 --> 05:50.680
Hey, Joe.

05:50.680 --> 05:54.880
Would you fuck, Justin?

05:54.880 --> 05:55.880
Would I?

05:55.880 --> 05:56.880
Have I?

05:56.880 --> 05:57.880
Did I?

05:58.200 --> 06:01.440
You had a rough middle school, didn't you?

06:01.440 --> 06:03.160
Doesn't everybody have a rough middle school?

06:03.160 --> 06:04.160
Nah.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.160
Okay, well...

06:05.160 --> 06:08.200
Nah, we're all super cool in middle school.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.800
That's why we have a role-playing podcast.

06:10.800 --> 06:21.040
Well, I'm glad you guys let me join you.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.360
How's everyone's week going?

06:22.360 --> 06:24.360
Better than middle school.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.360
About the same as middle school.

06:27.360 --> 06:30.040
It's a real middle school kind of week.

06:30.040 --> 06:34.920
I get teased a lot by my peers.

06:34.920 --> 06:35.920
Shut up, Justin.

06:35.920 --> 06:41.840
I'm about to start spring break and then not have to go back to class afterwards, so that's

06:41.840 --> 06:42.840
nice.

06:42.840 --> 06:43.840
That's wild.

06:43.840 --> 06:44.840
Pretty much.

06:44.840 --> 06:45.840
Aren't you a little old to be in college?

06:45.840 --> 06:51.360
Shouldn't you just quit like the rest of us?

06:51.360 --> 06:52.360
Nah.

06:53.360 --> 06:54.360
I like them young.

06:54.360 --> 06:55.360
Oh, no.

06:55.360 --> 06:58.360
My teacher's younger than me.

06:58.360 --> 06:59.360
Oh, yeah.

06:59.360 --> 07:05.360
You just like to learn from the people who are like the newest to the technology.

07:05.360 --> 07:10.360
There's a creepy Tony LaRosa bobblehead licking down approvingly at Luke.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.360
Hey, Tony.

07:12.360 --> 07:18.360
I love the things you do.

07:18.360 --> 07:19.360
Holy shit.

07:20.360 --> 07:25.360
This is for five people in our listening audience, but have you guys seen the video of Tony LaRosa?

07:25.360 --> 07:26.360
The DUI thing?

07:26.360 --> 07:30.360
The DUI in Florida in the early 2000s.

07:30.360 --> 07:31.360
No.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.360
It's pretty good.

07:32.360 --> 07:33.360
It's amazing.

07:33.360 --> 07:34.360
I haven't.

07:34.360 --> 07:38.360
Okay, Tony LaRosa, former manager of the St. Louis Cardinals.

07:38.360 --> 07:39.360
Rip.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.360
Rip.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.360
Good team.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.360
Yeah.

07:42.360 --> 07:43.360
Anyway, he-

07:43.360 --> 07:44.360
The MLB.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.360
Oh, yeah.

07:45.360 --> 07:49.360
He fell asleep at a stoplight in Florida during spring training.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.360
What?

07:50.360 --> 07:52.360
Just fell asleep, stopped in his car.

07:52.360 --> 07:58.360
There's an interview with him at the police station where he's just wasted, and he's like,

07:58.360 --> 08:00.360
do you know what I do?

08:00.360 --> 08:02.360
I'm in professional baseball.

08:02.360 --> 08:04.360
Oh, no.

08:07.360 --> 08:09.360
Anyway, it's good shit.

08:09.360 --> 08:11.360
That's super cool of him.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.360
Well, God damn it.

08:14.360 --> 08:20.360
He also took Albert Pools to that fucking Glenn Beck rally for America.

08:20.360 --> 08:21.360
I didn't know that.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.360
Yeah.

08:22.360 --> 08:23.360
How did Albert feel about that?

08:23.360 --> 08:30.360
No, that he was super into it because they're all rich, Christian.

08:30.360 --> 08:36.360
The two sometimes go hand in hand, other times not, and today we're playing a role playing

08:36.360 --> 08:37.360
game.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.360
Are you sure?

08:38.360 --> 08:43.360
Any of you who are just now joining us here on Pretending to Be People, let's give them

08:43.360 --> 08:44.360
a quick rundown.

08:44.360 --> 08:46.360
So on December 1st-

08:49.360 --> 08:53.360
Bold of you to assume we remember the stories.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.360
No, let's just do it real quick from start to finish.

08:55.360 --> 08:59.360
I show up every day just like blank.

09:01.360 --> 09:03.360
End of sentence.

09:04.360 --> 09:05.360
I was curious.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.360
All right, well, start blank today.

09:07.360 --> 09:09.360
This is not a good start.

09:09.360 --> 09:14.360
Walter and Alan Grimes in the lead, Charles Digby and Roger Fairfield in the middle, Bradley

09:14.360 --> 09:16.360
Cooper and Jack Russell in the back.

09:16.360 --> 09:19.360
You are all paddling for your lives.

09:19.360 --> 09:22.360
I need everyone to roll a sanity.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.360
I pass.

09:26.360 --> 09:27.360
Failed, 94.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.360
I pass.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.360
On a-

09:30.360 --> 09:31.360
Oh, no.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.360
49.

09:33.360 --> 09:34.360
Oh, shit.

09:34.360 --> 09:35.360
99.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.360
Yes.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.360
That's a great success, right?

09:38.360 --> 09:39.360
Almost 100.

09:39.360 --> 09:43.360
Joe and Luke, if you guys could leave the room real quick.

09:43.360 --> 09:44.360
Oh, no.

09:44.360 --> 09:45.360
Don't leave.

09:45.360 --> 09:46.360
He'll do bad things.

09:46.360 --> 09:47.360
Luke, no.

09:47.360 --> 09:48.360
Goodbye forever.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.360
We're about to drown in this lake.

09:50.360 --> 09:51.360
Oh, no.

09:51.360 --> 09:55.360
No, we're about to get eaten by a big thing.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.360
Or fully absorbed into the system.

09:57.360 --> 09:58.360
Oh.

09:58.360 --> 09:59.360
We'll start working against them.

09:59.360 --> 10:03.360
You guys failed sanity, which means that you turn around now.

10:03.360 --> 10:04.360
Sometimes it's a good thing.

10:04.360 --> 10:08.360
That Martin Cupertino, you're actually in the same canoe as Jack Russell.

10:08.360 --> 10:14.360
In the next canoe forward, we've got Charles Digby, who looks back just in time to see

10:14.360 --> 10:21.360
an unspeakable worm-like abomination erupts above the surface of the water.

10:21.360 --> 10:25.360
This thing rises 10 feet up out of the black inky darkness.

10:25.360 --> 10:32.360
It is tube-like, covered in a squamous black partially translucent membrane.

10:32.360 --> 10:39.360
Its body is segmented, and toxically green pulsating arteries and veins can be seen through

10:39.360 --> 10:41.360
its thin-looking exterior.

10:41.360 --> 10:45.360
It has no identifiable eyes or nose.

10:45.360 --> 10:52.360
Its cavernous, circular mouths, one sitting just inside the other, are lined with hooked

10:52.360 --> 10:57.360
teeth, and it spits out a saliva that is somehow darker than black.

10:57.360 --> 11:04.360
From this maw, a sharp stylet protrudes, like something between a tongue and a noodle-like

11:04.360 --> 11:05.360
needle.

11:05.360 --> 11:10.360
It plunges down and attaches to the top of Jack Russell's head.

11:10.360 --> 11:16.360
And then it rips him out of the back of the canoe, sucking the short, portly man up into

11:16.360 --> 11:23.360
its round, teeth-encircled mouth, before slipping quickly and quietly back into the pitch-black

11:23.360 --> 11:26.360
water of Lake Calm.

11:26.360 --> 11:29.360
I need you both to roll a d8.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.360
One.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.360
Yeah.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.360
Oh, what was that?

11:37.360 --> 11:38.360
Squamous.

11:38.360 --> 11:39.360
What was that?

11:39.360 --> 11:40.360
Squamous.

11:40.360 --> 11:41.360
Squamous.

11:41.360 --> 11:42.360
Did I say it right?

11:42.360 --> 11:43.360
I think you did.

11:43.360 --> 11:44.360
I thought it was squamous.

11:44.360 --> 11:45.360
I rolled a five.

11:45.360 --> 11:46.360
Okay, so you lose five sanity.

11:46.360 --> 11:47.360
Cool.

11:47.360 --> 11:52.360
Martin Cupertino loses five sanity, and Charles Digby just loses one sanity.

11:52.360 --> 11:55.360
You know, this can't be real.

11:55.360 --> 12:02.360
Martin Cupertino, I need you to put in order fight, flight, and freeze from most likely

12:02.360 --> 12:03.360
to least likely.

12:03.360 --> 12:05.360
Flight, fight, and freeze.

12:05.360 --> 12:08.360
Well, yeah, if he thinks he can't match it, flight.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.360
If he has no choice, fight.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.360
I think the last thing he would do is freeze.

12:12.360 --> 12:13.360
Okay, sounds good.

12:13.360 --> 12:14.360
So if you roll a one, you'll freeze.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.360
If you roll a two or a three, you'll fight.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.360
And if you roll a four, five, six.

12:18.360 --> 12:19.360
On a d6?

12:19.360 --> 12:21.360
You will flight.

12:21.360 --> 12:22.360
Three, which is fight.

12:22.360 --> 12:23.360
Fight.

12:23.360 --> 12:29.360
This thing is all the way back down in the water, so you are now alone in your canoe,

12:29.360 --> 12:30.360
ready to fight.

12:30.360 --> 12:32.360
What do I have on me?

12:32.360 --> 12:34.360
Do I have a syringe?

12:34.360 --> 12:36.360
Do I have anything else?

12:36.360 --> 12:41.360
You've got the map, and the syringe, and the cassettes.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.360
Nice.

12:42.360 --> 12:49.360
I unspool the cassettes and aim to choke the sea creature.

12:49.360 --> 12:56.360
No, I think I get the syringe out, pokey, and in one hand, and he's ready.

12:56.360 --> 13:00.360
This guy sucks, but he does know martial arts.

13:00.360 --> 13:01.360
He knows it.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.360
He can do it.

13:03.360 --> 13:07.360
I don't like to say that he can, because he sucks, but he can do it.

13:07.360 --> 13:08.360
He can do it.

13:08.360 --> 13:09.360
He's pretty good at it.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.360
So he's ready.

13:10.360 --> 13:11.360
He's in the canoe.

13:11.360 --> 13:12.360
Oh, my God.

13:12.360 --> 13:15.360
He's just like, fuck you.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.360
Fuck you, you worm piece of shit.

13:17.360 --> 13:21.360
And if it's him or the worm, it's going to be him and the worm.

13:21.360 --> 13:22.360
Okay.

13:22.360 --> 13:23.360
Yeah, fuck yeah.

13:23.360 --> 13:28.360
Then you'll get a bonus if it comes for you next.

13:28.360 --> 13:30.360
Joe, Luke.

13:30.360 --> 13:31.360
Fuck.

13:31.360 --> 13:32.360
Joe, a microphone?

13:32.360 --> 13:35.360
Do we say it in the mic?

13:35.360 --> 13:36.360
Joe.

13:36.360 --> 13:38.360
I'm sorry.

13:38.360 --> 13:41.360
We're both sorry.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.360
Walter Grimes.

13:49.360 --> 13:52.360
You're still rowing and rowing, and Alan is like, we got to keep rowing.

13:52.360 --> 13:53.360
We got to keep rowing.

13:53.360 --> 13:56.360
So I need you to roll a strength or an athletics or swimming.

13:56.360 --> 14:00.360
Walter succeeds on his check and does some good rows.

14:00.360 --> 14:01.360
Walter does?

14:01.360 --> 14:02.360
Or Alan does.

14:02.360 --> 14:03.360
Sorry.

14:03.360 --> 14:04.360
Walter fails.

14:04.360 --> 14:05.360
Walter fails.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.360
Okay, so you guys keep rowing.

14:06.360 --> 14:09.360
You're getting almost to the shore on the opposite side.

14:09.360 --> 14:13.360
You're very, very near the shore on the opposite side.

14:13.360 --> 14:18.360
Roger Fairfield, you're in a canoe with Charles Digby who...

14:18.360 --> 14:21.360
Roger, uh, uh, uh, uh.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.360
We got to row.

14:22.360 --> 14:23.360
We got to row.

14:23.360 --> 14:24.360
We got to row.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.360
He looks, I'm frozen staring behind us.

14:26.360 --> 14:27.360
Oh shit.

14:27.360 --> 14:29.360
I'll look behind me.

14:29.360 --> 14:36.360
You look behind you just in time to see the water just kind of like, and there's nothing

14:36.360 --> 14:42.360
there, including the nothingness that used to be Jack Russell, who is no longer in the

14:42.360 --> 14:43.360
back of the canoe.

14:43.360 --> 14:47.360
You just see Martin Cupertino by himself now.

14:47.360 --> 14:48.360
And what is he doing?

14:48.360 --> 14:50.360
Was he in front or back?

14:50.360 --> 14:51.360
He was in back.

14:51.360 --> 14:52.360
Let me just say that.

14:52.360 --> 14:53.360
Sure.

14:53.360 --> 14:58.360
Like he took time when they were fleeing at the start of this to say to Jack Russell,

14:58.360 --> 15:01.360
like, no, I'm in back.

15:01.360 --> 15:02.360
I steer.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.360
It's the power position of a canoe.

15:04.360 --> 15:06.360
So yeah, I mean like who was in back?

15:06.360 --> 15:07.360
Me.

15:07.360 --> 15:08.360
Okay.

15:08.360 --> 15:14.320
So Jack Russell gets eaten and uh, I guess I've got to do everything myself and he paddles

15:14.320 --> 15:15.320
that much harder.

15:15.320 --> 15:19.240
So I need you all to roll, uh, Justin and Thomas, Martin Cupertino and Charles Digby

15:19.240 --> 15:22.960
will be at a negative 20% for failing their sanity checks.

15:22.960 --> 15:23.960
Okay.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.120
I, I fail.

15:25.120 --> 15:27.680
I would have passed except for that negative 20.

15:27.680 --> 15:28.680
Yep.

15:28.680 --> 15:29.680
What was I rolling?

15:29.680 --> 15:30.680
Athletics?

15:30.680 --> 15:31.680
Yeah.

15:31.680 --> 15:32.680
Yeah.

15:32.680 --> 15:33.680
I passed.

15:33.680 --> 15:34.680
Oh wait.

15:34.680 --> 15:35.680
Athletics.

15:35.680 --> 15:36.680
I thought sanity.

15:36.680 --> 15:37.680
No athletics.

15:37.680 --> 15:42.400
Negative 25 minus 20 is 45 I pass 39.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.400
I failed.

15:43.400 --> 15:48.360
Am I just like, let's get the fuck out of here, Roger.

15:48.360 --> 15:51.120
I don't like his little chart that I see over there.

15:51.120 --> 15:54.520
I've got a little chart that they can see, so I'll just show it off.

15:54.520 --> 16:01.520
But basically there are four blank boxes for each canoe and the Grimes have three boxes

16:01.520 --> 16:05.060
marked off because they are the closest to the shore.

16:05.060 --> 16:09.180
And then Fairfield and Digby in a canoe have two out of the four boxes checked.

16:09.180 --> 16:10.180
Oh no.

16:10.180 --> 16:12.180
I thought most boxes was worse.

16:12.180 --> 16:14.180
Turns out it's good.

16:14.180 --> 16:15.860
The least boxes checked.

16:15.860 --> 16:20.100
Martin Cupertino just has one box checked out of four to get to the other side.

16:20.100 --> 16:21.120
Well, that makes sense.

16:21.120 --> 16:27.820
At this point, I'm going to roll a D six to decide as the water around all of you begins

16:27.820 --> 16:34.620
to move and something massive underneath is choosing its next target.

16:34.620 --> 16:39.220
We're going to say a Cooper Martin Cupertino.

16:39.220 --> 16:40.220
You're one.

16:40.220 --> 16:42.680
Uh, we got, you're rolling a D six.

16:42.680 --> 16:44.260
I'm rolling a D six.

16:44.260 --> 16:46.340
Roger Fairfield is two.

16:46.340 --> 16:48.340
Charles Digby is three.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.980
Walter Grimes is four.

16:49.980 --> 16:54.500
Alan Grimes is five, six re-roll miss.

16:54.500 --> 16:55.500
It stays dormant.

16:55.500 --> 16:56.500
How about that?

16:56.500 --> 16:57.500
A good option.

16:57.500 --> 16:58.500
I'm, I'm four.

16:58.500 --> 16:59.500
I don't know.

16:59.500 --> 17:03.220
Which dice did you just roll?

17:03.220 --> 17:04.220
It's a one.

17:04.220 --> 17:05.220
Martin.

17:05.220 --> 17:07.980
That's Martin Cupertino.

17:07.980 --> 17:09.820
So the water around you.

17:09.820 --> 17:10.820
Shit.

17:10.820 --> 17:11.820
Wow.

17:11.820 --> 17:13.820
Jack just built a whole cocktail.

17:13.820 --> 17:18.300
Hey, it looks okay.

17:18.300 --> 17:23.220
We were in a real tense moment.

17:23.220 --> 17:28.380
There's another ice cube.

17:28.380 --> 17:29.380
We got him a sippy cup.

17:29.380 --> 17:32.940
I got a closed lid on that there, bud.

17:32.940 --> 17:36.540
Have you been recording our casual conversation this whole time?

17:36.540 --> 17:40.380
No, he just, that is, that is from the country.

17:40.380 --> 17:41.660
That is from the country.

17:41.660 --> 17:42.660
Praise.

17:42.660 --> 17:44.380
No, I'm back.

17:44.380 --> 17:51.780
So that noise that you just heard was me spilling my drink all over myself and over a lot of

17:51.780 --> 17:52.780
XLR cables.

17:52.780 --> 17:57.940
That's what he calls simultaneously coming pissing and shitting his pants.

17:57.940 --> 17:58.940
Typical Zach.

17:58.940 --> 18:01.220
Spilled my drink.

18:01.220 --> 18:04.780
My cochlea just exploded everywhere.

18:04.780 --> 18:05.780
That's what it's called, right?

18:05.780 --> 18:06.780
No, you're close.

18:06.780 --> 18:07.780
You're very close.

18:07.780 --> 18:08.780
It's Ploweka.

18:08.780 --> 18:11.780
That's what it's called, right?

18:11.780 --> 18:12.900
So, implant.

18:12.900 --> 18:22.700
So it's not often that, all right, so piss, shit, and jizz just spewed out of Zach's ears.

18:22.700 --> 18:25.420
All right, shit.

18:25.420 --> 18:32.540
Okay, so it's not often that I would do this, but it makes sense that in that moment I'm

18:32.540 --> 18:37.820
going to use my actual actions instead of my dice roll.

18:37.820 --> 18:45.140
I had just rolled a one on your actual, I don't know what you mean, this giant abomination

18:45.140 --> 18:51.180
coming for Martin Cupertino, but I was reaching for my dice to roll that attack.

18:51.180 --> 18:56.380
So instead of that attack roll, I'm going to use the fumble because Zach fumbled my

18:56.380 --> 18:58.500
attempt to grab the dice.

18:58.500 --> 18:59.500
Gotcha.

18:59.500 --> 19:00.500
Yeah.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.500
You blundered.

19:01.500 --> 19:05.020
I blundered and therefore- Our actions in this world affect their world.

19:05.020 --> 19:06.020
Oh my God.

19:06.020 --> 19:08.060
That's too much responsibility.

19:08.060 --> 19:12.100
If we kill Zach, he can't do any bad stuff to us anymore.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.100
Oh no.

19:13.100 --> 19:15.300
He couldn't do any good stuff either.

19:15.300 --> 19:16.300
Oh.

19:16.300 --> 19:17.300
That's true.

19:17.300 --> 19:18.300
When has he?

19:18.300 --> 19:19.300
Aw.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.300
Aw.

19:20.420 --> 19:21.420
Not true.

19:21.420 --> 19:23.420
He flosses before every session.

19:23.420 --> 19:26.580
Like a big old silk pillow.

19:26.580 --> 19:29.380
So basically you all- Body pillow.

19:29.380 --> 19:35.900
Turn around just in time to see this absolute tube-like creature comes 10 feet out of the

19:35.900 --> 19:37.540
water- And spills its drink.

19:37.540 --> 19:44.820
And spills its drink all over, so actually- Shit.

19:44.820 --> 19:49.660
So what happens is the Grimes and Roger Fairfield haven't seen this yet, so I'll describe it

19:49.660 --> 19:52.820
once again, but it rises 10 feet out of the water.

19:52.820 --> 19:59.440
It is an unspeakable worm-like abomination, tube-like, covered in squamous black partially

19:59.440 --> 20:01.660
translucent membrane.

20:01.660 --> 20:07.860
Its body is segmented and toxically green pulsating arteries and veins can be seen through

20:07.860 --> 20:10.340
its thin looking exterior.

20:10.340 --> 20:13.660
It has no identifiable eyes or nose.

20:13.660 --> 20:19.440
Its cavernous circular mouths, one sitting just inside the other, are lined with hooked

20:19.440 --> 20:24.000
teeth and it spits out a saliva that is somehow darker than black.

20:24.000 --> 20:30.720
And actually, instead of going for an attack on Martin Cupertino, all of this spit comes

20:30.720 --> 20:34.280
out and just lands all over the canoe.

20:34.280 --> 20:40.880
You can roll a dodge or a dexterity to try to avoid this goop getting all over you.

20:40.880 --> 20:42.200
Didn't you say it already failed?

20:42.200 --> 20:44.520
Yeah, it failed- But it vomited.

20:44.520 --> 20:47.560
Literally grabbing you and- Doing a bad.

20:47.560 --> 20:48.560
Pulling you in.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.160
It just gaks.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.720
It does what Zach did.

20:51.720 --> 20:55.920
Okay, I got a 61.

20:55.920 --> 20:58.280
Roll athletics since that's a 65.

20:58.280 --> 20:59.280
There you go.

20:59.280 --> 21:03.780
So you swiftly move in this canoe from the back up to the front real quick.

21:03.780 --> 21:10.060
As the back gets completely drenched in this goop that is blacker than the water of Lake

21:10.060 --> 21:16.560
Calm, which you thought was already so dark that it basically pulled light away from the

21:16.560 --> 21:21.880
viewer's eyes and you guys can roll again to try to paddle away.

21:21.880 --> 21:25.440
Roger, pull it together.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.160
Athletics or what?

21:27.160 --> 21:28.160
Anything that'll work.

21:28.160 --> 21:29.160
So swimming, athletics.

21:29.160 --> 21:30.160
Pass.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.160
42.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.960
I was hoping I could say, you got it, bud, but I failed again.

21:33.960 --> 21:37.280
As I'm telling him to pull it together, I also failed more.

21:37.280 --> 21:38.760
I'm like, oh, cramp.

21:38.760 --> 21:40.600
So you guys both failed?

21:40.600 --> 21:41.600
Yeah.

21:41.720 --> 21:48.840
So as this goop just gets all over the back of Martin Cupertino's canoe, he jumps back

21:48.840 --> 21:54.080
and keeps paddling from the front with such a swiftness that he pulls up even with Roger

21:54.080 --> 21:56.120
Fairfield and Charles Digby.

21:56.120 --> 22:01.920
Just huge plunging drives into the water as he's fucking crewing it.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.380
Swiftly moving, yeah.

22:03.380 --> 22:06.320
Swiftly through the water in perfect, literally-

22:06.320 --> 22:07.320
Stroke.

22:07.320 --> 22:08.320
Stroke.

22:08.320 --> 22:09.320
Stroke.

22:09.320 --> 22:10.320
Stroke.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.320
He's saying that.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.040
We got to do it like that.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.040
My arms hurt.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.040
He's going to hear sticks.

22:15.040 --> 22:20.920
So the Grimes actually reach the shore on the other side and immediately Alan's like,

22:20.920 --> 22:23.800
we got to get up onto the shore.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.600
And he's trying to pull the canoe up onto the-

22:26.600 --> 22:32.120
I'll grab underneath where I was sitting and just, yeah, sprint, bringing it up on shore.

22:32.120 --> 22:33.920
And you guys are up on the shore.

22:33.920 --> 22:38.400
Now we've got three people in the water, so I'm going to roll another D6.

22:39.120 --> 22:42.680
Oh God, I'm so nervous to like move.

22:42.680 --> 22:44.120
Need a cup holder for you.

22:44.120 --> 22:50.440
All right, so one and two are going to be Martin Cupertino, three and four is Roger

22:50.440 --> 22:54.480
Fairfield, and five and six is Charles Digby.

22:54.480 --> 22:55.480
Cocked.

22:55.480 --> 22:57.640
Crack die.

22:57.640 --> 22:58.640
That's a two.

22:58.640 --> 22:59.640
Two correct die.

22:59.640 --> 23:00.640
Who is two?

23:00.640 --> 23:02.740
Martin Cupertino.

23:02.740 --> 23:03.740
This thing hates him.

23:03.740 --> 23:06.320
Quit being mean to Tommy.

23:06.320 --> 23:10.400
I mean, Martin is the one who should be.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.400
Yeah.

23:11.400 --> 23:15.120
This thing's coming for you.

23:15.120 --> 23:19.140
Just jump, like comes out of the water, almost like a proboscis, but like something from

23:19.140 --> 23:23.980
inside its maw is coming toward you and is trying to attach to the top of your head.

23:23.980 --> 23:29.320
How are you going to try to dissuade it from taking you into itself?

23:29.320 --> 23:33.880
I reach back behind me and grab the now departed Jack Russell's paddle.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.520
Actually, it would be right next to me because he was in front.

23:36.520 --> 23:37.520
Exactly.

23:37.520 --> 23:40.520
I grab that and I just try to shove it up the maw instead of my head.

23:40.520 --> 23:41.520
Absolutely.

23:41.520 --> 23:42.520
Okay.

23:42.520 --> 23:48.360
So go ahead and roll melee weapons or karate.

23:48.360 --> 23:51.240
I think I actually do have a martial arts skill.

23:51.240 --> 23:53.800
Where is it?

23:53.800 --> 23:55.640
If you wrote it in, it'd be on the left.

23:55.640 --> 23:57.000
Was it just your unarmed combat?

23:57.000 --> 23:58.720
It is my unarmed combat.

23:58.720 --> 24:02.120
Can I roll athletics or actually no, melee is better.

24:02.120 --> 24:03.120
Melee.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.360
Melee.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.360
Meal worm weapons.

24:06.360 --> 24:07.360
Yes.

24:07.360 --> 24:10.000
50 on a 50.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.480
I rolled a 10.

24:11.480 --> 24:12.480
So you win.

24:12.480 --> 24:13.480
Yeah.

24:13.480 --> 24:18.240
So as this thing comes down, this like noodle like needle coming out of the middle of its

24:18.240 --> 24:23.600
circular vast mouth is like trying to fight its way through.

24:23.600 --> 24:29.920
So Martin Cupertino with his left hand is still plunging his paddle into the water.

24:29.920 --> 24:30.920
Left.

24:30.920 --> 24:31.920
Right.

24:31.920 --> 24:32.920
Left.

24:32.920 --> 24:33.920
Right.

24:33.920 --> 24:39.360
And he reaches behind him for the paddle of the departed Jack Russell.

24:39.360 --> 24:44.800
And he just like jams it straight into the air behind him at where he thinks the mouth

24:44.800 --> 24:45.800
is.

24:45.800 --> 24:49.240
And it just happened to be the moment where this proboscis was coming in straight at your

24:49.240 --> 24:50.240
head.

24:50.240 --> 24:56.280
You knock it back and as the maw like gets pulled down with this weird style that's protruding

24:56.280 --> 24:57.800
from its mouth.

24:57.800 --> 25:06.960
You like jam the or in sideways like in star Wars when Luke gets the in the compactor.

25:06.960 --> 25:07.960
Yes.

25:07.960 --> 25:08.960
No.

25:08.960 --> 25:09.960
In the mouth.

25:09.960 --> 25:10.960
The rain core.

25:10.960 --> 25:11.960
The rain core.

25:11.960 --> 25:12.960
Yeah.

25:12.960 --> 25:13.960
I keep its jaws open.

25:13.960 --> 25:14.960
Yeah.

25:14.960 --> 25:15.960
Yeah.

25:15.960 --> 25:16.960
And it lets it lets out this.

25:16.960 --> 25:25.360
That might be a really cool OS startup sound.

25:25.360 --> 25:28.760
But he's now he's now he's paddling with both hands.

25:28.760 --> 25:29.760
All right.

25:29.760 --> 25:32.000
Everybody roll athletics except for Luke.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
You're good.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
You're safe.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Can I pass 16?

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Yeah, absolutely.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.380
As they're rowing and rowing, what are the Grimes doing?

25:38.380 --> 25:39.380
I pick up.

25:39.380 --> 25:45.260
I want to find a medium sized rock that's like kind of sharp and I'm going to skip it

25:45.260 --> 25:46.800
at the monster.

25:46.800 --> 25:47.800
Fantastic.

25:47.800 --> 25:52.560
So you'll do that to help aid if it's coming at someone on the next attack.

25:52.560 --> 25:53.800
Roger fails again.

25:54.320 --> 25:57.560
For every one of these, I rolled a 92, a 93, and a 96.

25:57.560 --> 25:58.560
Oh my God.

25:58.560 --> 26:01.920
Roger Fairfield can't canoe to save his God damn life.

26:01.920 --> 26:02.920
I mean, literally.

26:02.920 --> 26:03.920
He really can't.

26:03.920 --> 26:04.920
He rolled a 92, 93, and 94.

26:04.920 --> 26:05.920
I know.

26:05.920 --> 26:06.920
I know.

26:06.920 --> 26:07.920
Why didn't you lie?

26:07.920 --> 26:08.920
I should have lied.

26:08.920 --> 26:09.920
I should have lied.

26:09.920 --> 26:10.920
I passed.

26:10.920 --> 26:11.920
Hang on.

26:11.920 --> 26:12.920
Let's go back.

26:12.920 --> 26:13.920
It was a 92, a 93, and a 94.

26:13.920 --> 26:14.920
Roll again.

26:14.920 --> 26:15.920
We'll do everything for you.

26:15.920 --> 26:16.920
I passed as well.

26:16.920 --> 26:17.920
All right.

26:17.920 --> 26:22.840
So Fairfield Digby and Martin Cupertino, the canoes are side by side at this point and

26:22.880 --> 26:29.480
you guys are one success away from being safe on the shore on the other side as this water

26:29.480 --> 26:35.880
moves and you feel the canoes, both of your canoes just kind of like lift up a little

26:35.880 --> 26:38.160
bit as you're rowing.

26:38.160 --> 26:44.600
One two for Martin Cupertino, three four for Roger Fairfield, five six for Charles Digby.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.140
That's a four.

26:46.140 --> 26:47.420
That's Roger Fairfield.

26:47.420 --> 26:48.920
You deserve it.

26:48.920 --> 26:49.920
Okay.

26:50.000 --> 26:56.040
So first, as this thing is coming, as this thing is coming up out of the water, I want

26:56.040 --> 27:00.800
to roll from Walter Grimes for skipping a rock.

27:00.800 --> 27:01.800
Whatever it is.

27:01.800 --> 27:03.740
It's a 98, so I fail.

27:03.740 --> 27:06.480
The rock is too big and it skips twice and then it flunks.

27:06.480 --> 27:07.480
You just drop it.

27:07.480 --> 27:08.480
My wrist.

27:08.480 --> 27:09.480
Ow, my hand.

27:09.480 --> 27:10.480
Yeah, no.

27:10.480 --> 27:22.880
Alan will take a page out of your book and try to do the same thing.

27:22.880 --> 27:28.280
And he too fails, so there will be no assist on this, Joe.

27:28.280 --> 27:36.600
So as this thing is coming up out of the water, emitting this weird, almost green, almost

27:36.600 --> 27:40.720
dark, just like liquid that is all over its body.

27:40.720 --> 27:47.400
It's actually like an oil now that is covering the top of Lake Calm surrounding you.

27:47.400 --> 27:51.420
And it is coming down straight for your head.

27:51.420 --> 27:52.840
What are you doing?

27:52.840 --> 27:56.840
Having seen Martin just handle it with his oar, I'm going to try and if it's coming straight

27:56.840 --> 28:01.000
down at me, I want to knock it like a baseball bat would be knocking a ball out of the air.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Absolutely.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Go ahead and roll.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.560
Is that melee or unarmed?

28:04.560 --> 28:09.000
That'll be melee.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
You mean that thing I don't have?

28:11.000 --> 28:14.120
A ninety-two.

28:14.120 --> 28:18.160
I'm going to use, this is the third set of dice I've used, but I'm going to change the

28:18.160 --> 28:19.160
dice again.

28:19.160 --> 28:20.160
Let him re-roll.

28:20.160 --> 28:21.160
Let him re-roll.

28:21.160 --> 28:26.360
I rolled an eighty-four, so I failed.

28:26.360 --> 28:34.880
And so as this water beast rises up and comes down toward you, you bat away just enough,

28:34.880 --> 28:40.520
kind of throws it off its trajectory, and the proboscis goes right into the canoe in

28:40.520 --> 28:45.900
between you and Charles Digby, and it actually punctures into the canoe, so you'll both take

28:45.900 --> 28:51.320
a negative twenty percent on your next athletics checks to try to get to the safety of the

28:51.320 --> 28:52.320
shore.

28:52.320 --> 28:53.320
Wonderful.

28:53.320 --> 28:54.320
Now you're taking me down with you hun.

28:55.280 --> 29:04.880
But it is now back under the water, and you guys are rowing for your lives.

29:04.880 --> 29:06.120
I finally pass one.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.320
I get a forty-three.

29:07.320 --> 29:08.880
But wait, with your minus twenty percent?

29:08.880 --> 29:09.880
I don't pass.

29:09.880 --> 29:10.880
Fuck!

29:10.880 --> 29:13.880
Well, me neither.

29:13.880 --> 29:14.880
Shit.

29:14.880 --> 29:16.600
It doesn't really matter.

29:16.600 --> 29:18.320
Wait, is this good or bad?

29:18.320 --> 29:19.320
This is bad.

29:19.320 --> 29:20.320
You know it's terrible.

29:20.320 --> 29:21.320
You rolled a one hundred.

29:21.320 --> 29:22.320
Yeah, I rolled a one hundred.

29:22.320 --> 29:23.320
I rolled a one hundred.

29:23.320 --> 29:24.320
A one zero zero.

29:24.320 --> 29:25.320
Yep, that's a hundred.

29:25.320 --> 29:26.320
Aw.

29:26.320 --> 29:27.320
Wait, did you say you rolled a ninety-six?

29:27.320 --> 29:28.320
Okay.

29:28.320 --> 29:29.320
Earlier?

29:29.320 --> 29:30.320
Earlier, yeah.

29:30.320 --> 29:31.320
A one zero zero.

29:31.320 --> 29:32.320
That should have been a crit fail.

29:32.320 --> 29:34.000
A one zero zero is a no.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Did we make that rule?

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
I forgot about that.

29:36.000 --> 29:40.280
Yeah, it's the opposite of sixty-nine.

29:40.280 --> 29:48.960
Martin Cupertino will actually lose one of his successes on that, so Fairfield and Digby

29:48.960 --> 29:54.680
take the, uh, we're going into, like, percentiles of how much land is left between you and the

29:54.680 --> 30:00.360
shore, and you guys still have one success left, but now Martin Cupertino needs two or

30:00.360 --> 30:06.640
one critical success in order to make it to the shore as the water around you begins to

30:06.640 --> 30:07.640
bubble.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.920
I don't like this new mechanic, because it's scary.

30:09.920 --> 30:13.000
This chase, this water monster chase mechanic?

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Yeah.

30:14.000 --> 30:18.200
Well, tough shit, because it's going to come up in every situation from now on.

30:19.200 --> 30:20.600
That's a five.

30:20.600 --> 30:22.920
That's Charles Digby is getting it this time.

30:22.920 --> 30:23.920
No.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.920
Like, good getting it, or?

30:25.920 --> 30:26.920
No.

30:26.920 --> 30:28.520
Charles Digby's getting it.

30:28.520 --> 30:29.520
Getting it.

30:29.520 --> 30:31.800
Charles Digby can get it.

30:31.800 --> 30:34.000
Let's see if Charles Digby can get it.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
What do I need to roll?

30:35.000 --> 30:39.960
You need to roll whatever you're going to do to try to avoid getting sucked up into

30:39.960 --> 30:42.520
the worm.

30:42.520 --> 30:43.960
The water worm.

30:43.960 --> 30:45.680
Can I just, like, aggressively paddle forward?

30:46.160 --> 30:47.440
The thickest can beat the worm.

30:47.440 --> 30:52.560
It would freak out and be, like, to try and get out of its, like, path or-

30:52.560 --> 30:54.160
Yeah, you would have to-

30:54.160 --> 30:55.720
Would I still get my decrease, though?

30:55.720 --> 30:56.720
Yes, you would.

30:56.720 --> 30:59.760
Okay, then I won't do that, because that will be hard.

30:59.760 --> 31:03.360
I mean, I'm not going to talk into my mic anymore.

31:03.360 --> 31:07.040
I'm just going to move all the way over here.

31:07.040 --> 31:09.560
A sharp tongue is coming at you currently.

31:09.560 --> 31:10.560
What are you doing?

31:10.560 --> 31:13.400
I think I'd probably want to do, like, a similar thing, where, like, I want to bat it away

31:13.400 --> 31:14.400
with the paddle.

31:14.840 --> 31:16.840
Are they, like, big, sturdy paddles I'm assuming?

31:16.840 --> 31:20.080
Yeah, I mean, it's not original, but it has worked, so let's give it a go.

31:20.080 --> 31:22.440
I don't have any fucking other stuff to use.

31:22.440 --> 31:23.440
I know.

31:23.440 --> 31:25.440
I was trying to come up with something original, too, and I couldn't-

31:25.440 --> 31:26.440
You're stuck up on the water.

31:26.440 --> 31:29.440
It doesn't lend itself, so give it a go.

31:29.440 --> 31:30.440
Okay.

31:33.080 --> 31:34.080
I rolled a 4.

31:34.080 --> 31:35.560
I rolled a 22.

31:35.560 --> 31:39.160
I rolled a 29 for my rocks skipping.

31:39.160 --> 31:40.160
Oh, nice.

31:40.160 --> 31:41.160
Unfortunately-

31:41.920 --> 31:44.520
This is a very loyal little robot boy.

31:44.520 --> 31:47.800
That won't be able to help as-

31:47.800 --> 31:50.720
So it skips over and hits the worm, and nothing happens.

31:50.720 --> 31:55.520
Yeah, it actually hits the worm, and it's got a really thin exterior, and so you see

31:55.520 --> 32:02.120
one of the arteries of this thing just, like, flops out of the skin, and this toxically

32:02.120 --> 32:06.960
green, like, liquid begins pouring on top of Lake Calm.

32:06.960 --> 32:07.960
Can I roll damage?

32:07.960 --> 32:08.960
Sure.

32:08.960 --> 32:10.600
What'd I roll?

32:11.040 --> 32:12.040
A rock.

32:12.040 --> 32:13.040
D4.

32:13.040 --> 32:14.040
D4.

32:14.040 --> 32:16.040
A tiny boy.

32:16.040 --> 32:17.320
2.

32:17.320 --> 32:19.440
Fuck you, worm.

32:19.440 --> 32:23.080
And it lets out a little, like, little one.

32:23.080 --> 32:24.080
Just a little guy.

32:24.080 --> 32:25.080
Just a little guy.

32:25.080 --> 32:26.080
Just a little guy.

32:26.080 --> 32:27.080
However-

32:27.080 --> 32:29.520
Can Alan help, too?

32:29.520 --> 32:33.720
Help me throw every rock he can find.

32:33.720 --> 32:34.720
He failed.

32:34.720 --> 32:35.720
Oh.

32:35.720 --> 32:36.720
Fuck you, Alan.

32:37.400 --> 32:43.560
As Charles Digby just yells, fuck you, Alan, this sharp stylet protrudes, and it's this

32:43.560 --> 32:52.360
tongue, noodle-like needle plunges down and attaches to the top of Charles Digby's head,

32:52.360 --> 32:57.560
and it is ripping you up into its maw currently.

32:57.560 --> 33:03.560
You guys have one action to try to fix this, otherwise he's going into this creature.

33:03.560 --> 33:05.880
Well, Roger's gonna try and pull him down.

33:05.880 --> 33:06.880
All right.

33:06.880 --> 33:08.680
And what is Martin Cupertino doing?

33:08.680 --> 33:10.040
What is Walter Grimes doing?

33:10.040 --> 33:12.040
Growing, for sure.

33:12.040 --> 33:15.160
I just threw the rock, and I'm picking another one up.

33:15.160 --> 33:19.160
I'd like to use this opportunity to get another box checked on them.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.840
Okay, yeah, you can.

33:20.840 --> 33:23.840
So go ahead and roll.

33:23.840 --> 33:24.840
97.

33:24.840 --> 33:25.840
97.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.840
The roll.

33:27.840 --> 33:35.000
He's rolling backwards, because he's too shocked to think.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
I'm gonna roll strength.

33:37.000 --> 33:42.760
And I will roll strength against you, which is an 80.

33:42.760 --> 33:47.680
Well, that's a five.

33:47.680 --> 33:49.880
Oh my God, he rolled a three.

33:49.880 --> 33:51.680
That's a three.

33:51.680 --> 33:52.680
Yeah.

33:52.680 --> 33:53.680
Incredible.

33:53.680 --> 33:55.680
Holy shit.

33:55.680 --> 33:56.680
Absolutely incredible.

33:56.680 --> 33:59.680
Holy shit.

33:59.680 --> 34:04.960
Charles Digby, as this thing has you by the top of the head, it's literally pulling you

34:04.960 --> 34:07.800
up and you're five feet off the ground.

34:07.800 --> 34:14.240
The only thing keeping you connected to this canoe is Roger Fairfield, who has hands on

34:14.240 --> 34:19.840
both of your feet and is just in a tug of war with a giant Xenonema toad.

34:19.840 --> 34:23.280
And he's just pulling and pulling, and this thing's pulling at your head.

34:23.280 --> 34:25.360
I need you to roll a constitution.

34:25.360 --> 34:28.480
I also like to think I'm trying to punch it in the head.

34:28.480 --> 34:29.480
Yes.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.480
I'm just like, fuck off.

34:31.480 --> 34:32.480
Constitution.

34:32.480 --> 34:33.480
Oh, good.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
That's not super high.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
I pass.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.680
53 on a 55.

34:38.680 --> 34:44.720
You feel your spine literally is trying to disconnect itself as this thing is pulling

34:44.720 --> 34:52.760
you apart and you reach up and grab onto this thing's tongue just in time before it snapped

34:52.760 --> 34:57.600
your spinal cord and ripped your head off of the rest of your body.

34:57.600 --> 35:03.700
You and Roger Fairfield together just like snap this thing off your head.

35:03.700 --> 35:06.440
You are now, what was your hair situation like before?

35:06.440 --> 35:09.240
It was, I'm just, you know, short brown hair.

35:09.240 --> 35:14.280
You know that sketch from I Think You Should Leave where you can hire someone dressed in

35:14.280 --> 35:19.240
a gorilla costume to come rip your toupee off?

35:19.240 --> 35:23.040
Well that happens and you get scalped.

35:23.040 --> 35:24.920
You hired a nematode.

35:24.920 --> 35:31.040
Your head is bleeding to the point to where your eyes are having trouble seeing through

35:31.040 --> 35:39.280
the Goldeneye style blood rushing down your face, but your back just popped in the best

35:39.280 --> 35:40.280
way.

35:40.280 --> 35:41.880
You decompressed my spine, bro.

35:41.880 --> 35:42.960
Thanks dude.

35:42.960 --> 35:46.240
And as it pops off, it flings itself backward.

35:46.240 --> 35:51.480
It was putting so much into it that it just rips backward into the water as it falls backwards

35:51.480 --> 35:59.720
and you fall onto Roger Fairfield in the canoe safe for now but bleeding all over everything.

35:59.720 --> 36:03.200
Is it like if George Costanza got like a head wound right on top?

36:03.200 --> 36:04.200
Yes.

36:04.200 --> 36:05.200
Like they have the little sides?

36:05.200 --> 36:06.200
Yeah.

36:06.200 --> 36:07.200
You're Costanz-ing.

36:07.200 --> 36:16.680
However, where the bald spot is is just raw blood and like skin that is like three layers

36:16.680 --> 36:20.760
less than it was epithelially speaking.

36:20.760 --> 36:23.360
I got to piss.

36:23.360 --> 36:24.360
Oh, thank you, Joe.

36:24.360 --> 36:25.360
I got you, man.

36:25.360 --> 36:26.360
Thank you, Joe.

36:26.360 --> 36:27.360
I love you.

36:27.360 --> 36:31.360
Dude, speaking of Costanza.

36:31.360 --> 36:40.240
For just imminent consumption, dirty Hershey's.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.240
Dirty Hershey's.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.240
Y'all heard about that dirty Hershey's?

36:42.240 --> 36:43.240
Those Hershey's clerks.

36:43.240 --> 36:48.040
Dude, dirty Hershey's is my favorite rapper and it's also me.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.040
I'm dirty Hershey's.

36:49.040 --> 36:53.000
Yeah, I'm definitely going to call every bout of diarrhea from now on.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Dirty Hershey's.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Dirty Hershey's.

36:55.000 --> 37:00.680
That's what I call other Eagles fans who are from Hershey, Pennsylvania.

37:00.680 --> 37:02.680
It was too far.

37:02.680 --> 37:03.680
I got it.

37:03.680 --> 37:04.680
It was too far.

37:04.680 --> 37:05.680
Elbow bump.

37:05.680 --> 37:06.680
Elbow bump.

37:06.680 --> 37:07.680
I mean, you can get it but it doesn't make it good.

37:07.680 --> 37:08.680
Thank you.

37:08.680 --> 37:09.680
Did you hit record?

37:09.680 --> 37:10.680
Yes, I did.

37:10.680 --> 37:11.680
Are you sure?

37:11.680 --> 37:17.520
You want to try again after that Hershey, Pennsylvania joke?

37:18.040 --> 37:21.080
Yeah, I don't want to miss out on dirty Hersh.

37:21.080 --> 37:24.760
As this thing flops back and just lands in the water.

37:24.760 --> 37:26.880
How dong-like is this thing?

37:26.880 --> 37:27.880
That's what I was thinking.

37:27.880 --> 37:30.400
It's pretty dong-like.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.720
Just the dong flapping around.

37:31.720 --> 37:37.480
Have you ever opened your penis hole and it looks like weird little lips?

37:37.480 --> 37:39.720
Is that what its mouth looks like?

37:39.720 --> 37:40.720
Ow.

37:40.720 --> 37:45.240
It's like a urethra with multiple circular teeth all inside of it.

37:45.240 --> 37:49.320
Do you guys have dick teeth?

37:49.320 --> 37:50.320
How do you forget?

37:50.320 --> 37:52.200
Do you guys have tails?

37:52.200 --> 38:00.200
How do you process the urine crystals if you don't have dick teeth?

38:00.200 --> 38:05.680
Bradley Cooper, Charles Digby, Walter and Alan Grimes, and Roger Fairfield, you are

38:05.680 --> 38:14.360
all standing in the room where you met for orientation and two steps forward, three steps

38:14.360 --> 38:15.360
backward.

38:15.360 --> 38:17.360
Oh, wait.

38:17.360 --> 38:21.520
How are we supposed to feel motivated to escape this creature on the lake, Zach?

38:21.520 --> 38:26.680
You don't know how to feel about anything currently because your mind is being moved

38:26.680 --> 38:29.480
from place to place so constantly.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.360
Where's everyone at mentally?

38:31.360 --> 38:32.360
Which room are we in?

38:32.360 --> 38:33.360
I'm on the lake.

38:33.360 --> 38:34.440
I'm still on the lake.

38:34.440 --> 38:38.440
And yet you're standing in this room and you have this spray bottle in your hand.

38:38.440 --> 38:39.440
Which room are we in again?

38:39.440 --> 38:40.440
The meeting room.

38:40.440 --> 38:42.520
And did Angela just close the door on us?

38:42.520 --> 38:43.960
Well, Angela's not in here.

38:43.960 --> 38:47.800
I know, but does it feel like the time when she just closed the door on us?

38:47.800 --> 38:48.800
I don't know.

38:48.800 --> 38:51.200
I think the whole point is to determine that sort of thing.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.200
Do you?

38:52.200 --> 38:53.200
Okay.

38:53.200 --> 38:54.200
Well, okay.

38:54.200 --> 38:55.560
I've got the spray bottle in my hand.

38:55.560 --> 39:00.520
I'm kicking open the outside door and I'm looking for any motherfucker who works here

39:00.520 --> 39:01.520
to spray.

39:01.520 --> 39:05.440
As you kick out the outside door, you guys all look out and you see that it is completely

39:05.440 --> 39:06.440
empty.

39:06.440 --> 39:11.260
You see that there is the desk on your left and there's the water cooler with the coffee

39:11.260 --> 39:15.080
machine on your right and it is dead silent and there's no one around.

39:15.080 --> 39:16.080
I want to look at Charles.

39:16.080 --> 39:17.080
Is he scalped?

39:17.080 --> 39:18.080
No.

39:18.080 --> 39:20.580
Do I remember that I got scalped?

39:20.580 --> 39:21.580
Yes.

39:21.580 --> 39:22.580
I'm like...

39:22.580 --> 39:23.580
Oh, sorry.

39:23.580 --> 39:29.020
As you poke at your head, you feel just immense pain rushing through like the back, your back.

39:29.020 --> 39:30.020
Like it's just like...

39:30.020 --> 39:31.900
The memory of pain or...

39:31.900 --> 39:36.500
Like yeah, it's like an idea of pain that is just like streaming down your back and

39:36.500 --> 39:37.500
yet you feel hair.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.700
And I look at Roger and I'm like, am I...

39:39.700 --> 39:40.700
No, you're fine.

39:40.700 --> 39:41.700
You're fine.

39:41.700 --> 39:42.700
You're fine.

39:42.700 --> 39:43.700
You're fine.

39:43.700 --> 39:44.700
And then I'm like...

39:44.700 --> 39:48.700
I can like feel my fucking back just rushing with pain.

39:48.700 --> 39:50.180
I'm like, oh, my fucking back.

39:50.180 --> 39:52.100
And I'm like, look, look, look at it.

39:52.100 --> 39:53.100
Look at it.

39:53.100 --> 39:54.100
And I like lift the back...

39:54.100 --> 39:55.100
My back shirt up.

39:55.100 --> 39:56.100
I look at it.

39:56.100 --> 39:57.100
It's fine.

39:57.100 --> 39:58.100
You're fine.

39:58.100 --> 39:59.100
You're fine.

39:59.100 --> 40:00.100
You're fine.

40:00.100 --> 40:01.100
You're fine.

40:01.100 --> 40:02.100
Calm down.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.100
Calm down.

40:03.100 --> 40:04.100
You're fine.

40:04.100 --> 40:05.100
Oh, God.

40:05.100 --> 40:06.100
As you lift it up though, you do notice that you have the little mark on the inside of

40:06.100 --> 40:07.100
your elbow pit.

40:07.100 --> 40:08.100
Oh, fuck.

40:08.100 --> 40:09.100
Do you...

40:09.100 --> 40:10.100
Do you...

40:10.500 --> 40:11.500
Do you have this?

40:11.500 --> 40:12.500
I...

40:12.500 --> 40:13.500
I...

40:13.500 --> 40:14.500
I still do.

40:14.500 --> 40:15.500
Yeah.

40:15.500 --> 40:16.500
Yeah.

40:16.500 --> 40:17.500
We tried.

40:17.500 --> 40:18.500
We...

40:18.500 --> 40:19.500
Walter and I, we were throwing rocks.

40:19.500 --> 40:20.500
We were trying to...

40:20.500 --> 40:21.500
I think we're saved.

40:21.500 --> 40:22.500
I don't...

40:22.500 --> 40:23.500
Alan, do you have a mark?

40:23.500 --> 40:28.860
And he holds up his arm and pulls up his shirt and there's a mark on the inside, little blood

40:28.860 --> 40:30.360
dried up.

40:30.360 --> 40:34.620
I want to run behind the desk and see if there's a gun underneath.

40:34.620 --> 40:36.660
Roll search.

40:36.660 --> 40:38.620
Fail.

40:38.620 --> 40:39.960
You do not find a gun.

40:40.820 --> 40:44.820
There's no gun there, so you do find a gun.

40:44.820 --> 40:47.680
This game's wild.

40:47.680 --> 40:50.400
I have a question to ask Zach that they shouldn't listen to.

40:50.400 --> 40:51.400
Oh, okay.

40:51.400 --> 40:52.400
Take your headphones off, I guess.

40:52.400 --> 40:53.400
Thomas.

40:53.400 --> 40:55.000
Why don't you just ask him?

40:55.000 --> 40:57.720
Is it my first time again or is that...

40:57.720 --> 40:58.720
No.

40:58.720 --> 40:59.720
You remember everything.

40:59.720 --> 41:00.720
You're back.

41:00.720 --> 41:04.060
What did you touch?

41:04.060 --> 41:08.240
And that echoes in your ear of Jack Russell saying, what did...

41:08.240 --> 41:09.920
What did you touch?

41:09.920 --> 41:10.920
What did you touch?

41:10.920 --> 41:11.920
There you go.

41:11.920 --> 41:12.920
That was nice.

41:12.920 --> 41:13.920
What did you touch?

41:13.920 --> 41:15.920
Just echo, echo, echo.

41:15.920 --> 41:16.920
Is he in the room?

41:16.920 --> 41:17.920
Nope.

41:17.920 --> 41:19.260
Is there any kind of...

41:19.260 --> 41:20.480
Can I roll some kind of...

41:20.480 --> 41:22.840
Why, just spill your beans.

41:22.840 --> 41:26.400
Can I roll some kind of search to see if there's been a trace of someone in here or does it

41:26.400 --> 41:27.720
look totally untouched?

41:27.720 --> 41:31.220
It's not that it's abandoned, but there's just no one in here right now.

41:31.220 --> 41:36.640
It's as if when you first came in to a calm, comfy campground, there was no one in the

41:36.640 --> 41:37.640
lobby.

41:37.640 --> 41:38.760
It's exactly like that.

41:38.760 --> 41:41.800
Is there any other kind of search role I can also do for anything?

41:41.800 --> 41:45.840
Well, if you're wanting to find something, you could roll search if you'd tell me what

41:45.840 --> 41:46.840
you're trying to find.

41:46.840 --> 41:49.480
Oh, then no.

41:49.480 --> 41:52.560
I'm searching the secret places for something interesting.

41:52.560 --> 41:58.920
Oh, can I search for the McGuffin to solve all those problems?

41:58.920 --> 42:02.480
I'd like to find the Maltese Falcon, please.

42:02.480 --> 42:04.040
Oh, I didn't...

42:04.040 --> 42:08.320
Oh, no, I got a 69, which does that a crit success?

42:08.320 --> 42:10.320
That is a crit success.

42:10.320 --> 42:11.320
Crit success.

42:11.320 --> 42:12.320
Whatever this is.

42:12.320 --> 42:13.320
Okay, yeah.

42:13.320 --> 42:21.280
So Charles Digby is looking all around, and he finds a tape with James saying, here's

42:21.280 --> 42:23.080
what's going on.

42:23.080 --> 42:30.920
Well, distraught, you put your hand up against the wall, and you feel the wall begin to give

42:30.920 --> 42:34.680
way a little bit as you found this secret door.

42:34.700 --> 42:42.920
And as you push into it, this room opens up, and looking into it, it is a long, long room.

42:42.920 --> 42:48.080
You can't see the end of it, and it is lit by the floor, and the darkness is coming from

42:48.080 --> 42:54.120
above, and there's these shadows of all these metal shelves, and you have opened up a secret

42:54.120 --> 42:57.080
door into the room with all the tapes.

42:57.080 --> 42:59.280
Geographically, where is this room?

42:59.280 --> 43:01.200
It's just around the corner from the meeting room.

43:01.200 --> 43:04.880
It was down a slight hallway from where you guys were.

43:04.880 --> 43:08.160
Sure, but if the island is the face of the clock, what time is it at?

43:08.160 --> 43:09.160
We're in the center.

43:09.160 --> 43:10.160
Two o'clock.

43:10.160 --> 43:11.160
Aren't we?

43:11.160 --> 43:12.160
What?

43:12.160 --> 43:13.160
It's at two o'clock from the center?

43:13.160 --> 43:14.160
It doesn't matter.

43:14.160 --> 43:18.280
Then why is the island the face of the clock?

43:18.280 --> 43:22.440
This is all you've given us.

43:22.440 --> 43:24.400
Can I roll to see if I have my tape player on me?

43:24.400 --> 43:25.400
Yeah.

43:25.400 --> 43:26.400
Luck?

43:26.400 --> 43:27.400
Yeah, 50-50.

43:27.400 --> 43:28.400
I don't.

43:28.600 --> 43:29.600
What?

43:29.600 --> 43:30.600
Aww.

43:30.600 --> 43:31.600
This is that room.

43:31.600 --> 43:32.600
This is that room.

43:32.600 --> 43:33.600
We were in here before.

43:33.600 --> 43:34.600
Do you guys remember that?

43:34.600 --> 43:39.600
Do you remember the room with all the tapes?

43:39.600 --> 43:40.600
I remember.

43:40.600 --> 43:42.720
We should find a way to play one.

43:42.720 --> 43:44.440
Yeah, I want to go further in.

43:44.440 --> 43:45.760
Are you guys all going further in?

43:45.760 --> 43:49.400
Can I search for a tape player, like, in the office or something?

43:49.400 --> 43:54.280
We're not, because Martin Cupertino has continued to run out the front door, and he's running

43:54.280 --> 43:55.280
towards the boat docks.

43:55.280 --> 43:56.600
What are the rest of you doing?

43:56.600 --> 43:57.880
Searching for a tape player.

43:58.360 --> 44:01.240
As you look around, it's just shelves, shelves, shelves, shelves.

44:01.240 --> 44:02.240
I don't know.

44:02.240 --> 44:04.040
I want to try and find our shelves again.

44:04.040 --> 44:05.040
Yeah, I'll go with it.

44:05.040 --> 44:06.280
Or is it so gargantuan?

44:06.280 --> 44:09.120
I mean, looking into it, it is infinite and vast.

44:09.120 --> 44:10.120
Oh, okay.

44:10.120 --> 44:11.600
But you can try if you want.

44:11.600 --> 44:12.760
Roger Fairfield, what are you doing?

44:12.760 --> 44:13.760
I don't know.

44:13.760 --> 44:16.080
I don't know what Roger would do right now.

44:16.080 --> 44:17.600
He's freaked out, but he doesn't...

44:17.600 --> 44:18.880
I don't think he would run for the boats.

44:18.880 --> 44:20.840
I think the boats are the last thing he wants to be on.

44:20.840 --> 44:24.480
Yeah, I mean, especially with what happened to my head.

44:24.480 --> 44:27.280
I'm like, I don't want to even try to go back there.

44:27.320 --> 44:31.800
He's going to yell for Angela and then maybe go into that back office that we saw James

44:31.800 --> 44:33.040
in previously.

44:33.040 --> 44:36.760
As you're hollering for Angela, can you do it for me real quick?

44:36.760 --> 44:37.760
Angela!

44:37.760 --> 44:38.760
Angie!

44:38.760 --> 44:39.760
Angie!

44:39.760 --> 44:44.200
That begins to echo out and just reverberate and repeat.

44:44.200 --> 44:49.560
Walter and Alan Grimes, Charles Digby, Roger Fairfield, and Martin Cupertino, you are all

44:49.560 --> 44:51.600
walking through the woods.

44:51.600 --> 44:53.240
You're surrounded by trees.

44:53.240 --> 44:54.320
You're running through the woods.

44:54.320 --> 44:55.320
You're running through the woods.

44:55.320 --> 45:00.920
Martin Cupertino, you have the map out, and you're leading the group through this jungle

45:00.920 --> 45:03.320
trying to find the door.

45:03.320 --> 45:08.240
Charles Digby, you feel blood rushing down your face.

45:08.240 --> 45:13.080
I need you to roll a D6 and half it for damage.

45:13.080 --> 45:14.080
Two.

45:14.080 --> 45:17.440
All right, lose two hit points.

45:17.440 --> 45:18.440
He rolled a four.

45:18.440 --> 45:21.200
Made a two in his mind.

45:21.200 --> 45:22.200
Quick math.

45:22.200 --> 45:24.640
The fuck up, John.

45:24.640 --> 45:26.240
Give away the secrets.

45:26.240 --> 45:33.080
I'm not good at math, but I think we all assumed he rolled a four when he got to it.

45:33.080 --> 45:38.760
Okay, so who is helping Martin Cupertino with the map, or are you guys allowing Martin Cupertino

45:38.760 --> 45:41.200
to just lead you with his skills?

45:41.200 --> 45:45.200
Before that, I assume I'm wearing an over shirt or something.

45:45.200 --> 45:50.560
Can I tear it up to make a weird little bandage for my head, like a little hat for my head?

45:50.560 --> 45:51.560
Yes, absolutely you can.

45:51.560 --> 45:53.820
I want to cover up my sad head.

45:53.820 --> 46:00.180
Can I use intelligence to read the map?

46:00.180 --> 46:01.180
It'll be survival.

46:01.180 --> 46:04.180
Does anybody have a good survival?

46:04.180 --> 46:05.180
Nope.

46:05.180 --> 46:06.180
I do.

46:06.180 --> 46:11.860
I feel like there's other ways to read a map, but I think if maybe you were smart enough,

46:11.860 --> 46:13.740
you could figure out what it was telling you.

46:13.740 --> 46:15.900
You could do intelligence at a negative 40.

46:15.900 --> 46:17.940
That's still better than survival.

46:17.940 --> 46:18.940
What's your survival?

46:18.940 --> 46:20.740
I'm actually pretty good at maps.

46:20.740 --> 46:21.740
It's part of my job.

46:21.740 --> 46:22.740
It's part of what I do.

46:22.980 --> 46:23.980
I can read it for you.

46:23.980 --> 46:25.260
I can navigate it.

46:25.260 --> 46:28.660
But you also think your fake wife is real, so...

46:28.660 --> 46:30.140
My wife-wife is my wife.

46:30.140 --> 46:31.560
Can we trust you?

46:31.560 --> 46:32.560
It's my wife.

46:32.560 --> 46:34.100
I don't know where she is.

46:34.100 --> 46:35.380
Hey, ease up on him.

46:35.380 --> 46:37.020
He can still read the fucking map.

46:37.020 --> 46:39.740
I need to ask Zach something without you guys hearing.

46:39.740 --> 46:40.740
Tough shit.

46:40.740 --> 46:45.740
What the fuck is wrong with Tom and us?

46:45.740 --> 46:46.740
Hey, Joe.

46:46.740 --> 46:52.420
So, Joe remembers that when I was in the office with James, he asked if I was single.

46:53.020 --> 46:55.740
You gave me a not yes.

46:55.740 --> 46:58.060
Does that come back to Roger at any point?

46:58.060 --> 47:02.460
Yeah, let's say that it comes back to you right now as he's asking about your wife.

47:02.460 --> 47:03.460
Okay.

47:03.460 --> 47:04.460
All right, let's do it.

47:04.460 --> 47:05.460
Everybody back.

47:05.460 --> 47:11.140
So, Martin Cupertino is pressing Roger Fairfield about his wife.

47:11.140 --> 47:12.140
Press me.

47:12.140 --> 47:13.140
Press him, baby.

47:13.140 --> 47:17.060
Hey, why don't we have your fake wife read this map?

47:17.060 --> 47:18.060
My wife is real.

47:18.060 --> 47:21.500
We've been together for...

47:21.500 --> 47:23.740
We've been together for...

47:23.740 --> 47:25.820
I met her.

47:25.820 --> 47:27.260
I don't...

47:27.260 --> 47:28.620
I was...

47:28.620 --> 47:34.380
I was talking to James and he asked if I was single.

47:34.380 --> 47:35.380
I said yes.

47:35.380 --> 47:36.380
I said yes.

47:36.380 --> 47:37.380
I said yes.

47:37.380 --> 47:38.380
I don't...

47:38.380 --> 47:39.380
Who's...

47:39.380 --> 47:40.380
I don't...

47:40.380 --> 47:41.380
I don't...

47:41.380 --> 47:43.660
I don't have a wife.

47:43.660 --> 47:44.660
I don't have a wife!

47:44.660 --> 47:45.660
Hey, buddy.

47:45.660 --> 47:48.580
I feel like all the answers are on the other side of this door.

47:48.580 --> 47:49.580
Can you help us get there?

47:49.580 --> 47:50.580
Yeah.

47:50.580 --> 47:51.580
Yeah.

47:51.580 --> 47:52.580
Yeah.

47:52.580 --> 47:53.580
Yeah.

47:53.580 --> 47:54.580
Yeah.

47:54.580 --> 47:55.580
Yeah.

47:55.580 --> 47:56.580
Yeah.

47:56.580 --> 47:57.580
We gotta get out of here.

47:57.580 --> 47:58.580
We gotta get out of here.

47:58.580 --> 47:59.580
That's where...

47:59.580 --> 48:00.580
Hey, maybe Angie's on the other side of the door.

48:00.580 --> 48:01.580
I don't...

48:01.580 --> 48:02.580
I don't know who she is.

48:02.580 --> 48:03.580
I don't know who she is.

48:03.580 --> 48:04.580
Okay.

48:04.580 --> 48:05.580
Just calm down.

48:05.580 --> 48:06.580
Just calm down.

48:06.580 --> 48:07.580
The answers are on the other side of the door on this map.

48:07.580 --> 48:08.580
Okay.

48:08.580 --> 48:09.580
Now, here's the thing.

48:09.580 --> 48:10.580
So, when you guys roll, who is reading the map?

48:10.580 --> 48:11.580
Are both of you reading the map?

48:11.580 --> 48:12.580
I think...

48:12.580 --> 48:13.580
Yeah, I think both of us.

48:13.580 --> 48:19.000
I need you both to roll into my little box that I'm holding.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.820
It's Joe's dice rolling box.

48:20.820 --> 48:24.380
And I need you guys to roll into it and not see the result.

48:24.380 --> 48:25.380
Oh, shit.

48:25.380 --> 48:26.380
Because...

48:26.380 --> 48:27.380
Because you're gonna lie?

48:27.380 --> 48:28.380
Like, what?

48:28.380 --> 48:29.380
So...

48:29.380 --> 48:30.380
Because...

48:30.380 --> 48:35.180
Because I'd like the game to go a certain way, but...

48:35.180 --> 48:38.980
Depending on whether or not you succeed or fail, I will tell you which way you think

48:38.980 --> 48:39.980
you should go.

48:39.980 --> 48:44.420
I don't want you to know whether you've read the map successfully or not, so I want you

48:44.420 --> 48:46.020
both to roll into this.

48:46.020 --> 48:47.020
Okay.

48:47.020 --> 48:48.020
Cool excuse, but...

48:48.020 --> 48:49.020
Joe, look at it.

48:49.020 --> 48:50.020
Check it out.

48:50.020 --> 48:51.020
Check it out.

48:51.020 --> 48:52.020
He's busy counting.

48:52.020 --> 48:53.020
Look.

48:53.020 --> 48:54.020
Okay.

48:54.020 --> 48:58.740
What do you have for intelligence minus 40?

48:58.740 --> 48:59.740
30.

48:59.740 --> 49:00.740
Okay.

49:00.740 --> 49:01.740
And what do you have for survival?

49:01.740 --> 49:02.740
40.

49:02.740 --> 49:03.740
Okay.

49:03.740 --> 49:08.740
So, as you guys are approaching, you're following the line on the map to the door.

49:09.500 --> 49:15.660
And you notice directly across from you on the line where you are heading from off the

49:15.660 --> 49:22.500
trail toward the door, you're about 20 yards away from where you think the door is, there's

49:22.500 --> 49:24.220
a cave opening.

49:24.220 --> 49:29.940
And then above that, there's a slight opening in the trees that leads above the cave.

49:29.940 --> 49:37.860
I'd like to roll to double check.

49:37.980 --> 49:41.140
We've got to be really careful about how we read this map.

49:41.140 --> 49:48.660
Martin Cupertino, you are positive that you should go above the cave and about.

49:48.660 --> 49:55.100
Roger Fairfield, you're pretty positive that this map is leading you into the cave and

49:55.100 --> 49:56.940
then out through the door.

49:56.940 --> 49:59.460
Fuck, and this is based on how we rolled?

49:59.460 --> 50:00.460
Yep.

50:00.460 --> 50:01.940
And we don't know how we rolled.

50:01.940 --> 50:02.940
We don't know.

50:02.940 --> 50:03.940
But we don't know.

50:03.940 --> 50:04.940
Okay, so how do we feel about how we did it?

50:05.020 --> 50:08.020
I will tell you, one of you succeeded and the other one critically failed.

50:08.020 --> 50:09.020
We got that.

50:09.020 --> 50:11.020
One of them critically failed.

50:11.020 --> 50:12.020
Oh no.

50:12.020 --> 50:13.020
Listen.

50:13.020 --> 50:14.420
We need to go through those trees.

50:14.420 --> 50:19.940
I mean, I read the map, I work with, I'm an archaeologist, I follow maps to places all

50:19.940 --> 50:20.940
the time.

50:20.940 --> 50:21.940
It's through the cave.

50:21.940 --> 50:24.700
Everybody follows maps to things as much as an archaeologist does.

50:24.700 --> 50:25.700
We all drive somewhere.

50:25.700 --> 50:27.820
It's not like you're a fucking mapologist.

50:27.820 --> 50:33.940
I have to decipher strange maps sometimes and this is a strange map and I feel confident

50:33.940 --> 50:34.940
it's through the cave.

50:34.940 --> 50:37.260
I think your result is pretty strange.

50:37.260 --> 50:40.460
Why the fuck would we get out of the forest through a cave instead of going through the

50:40.460 --> 50:41.460
clearing in the forest?

50:41.460 --> 50:43.480
Why is it called a door on the map?

50:43.480 --> 50:44.860
There's no door here.

50:44.860 --> 50:46.540
It's all symbolic.

50:46.540 --> 50:49.780
There's got to be another entry on the other side of the cave.

50:49.780 --> 50:50.780
It's our way out.

50:50.780 --> 50:52.880
Everyone, you go your own ways.

50:52.880 --> 50:54.420
You figure it out for yourselves.

50:54.420 --> 50:56.140
I'm going through the tree.

50:56.140 --> 50:57.140
Who's following Martin Cupertino?

50:57.140 --> 51:00.140
Don't go into the caves, you fucking idiot.

51:00.140 --> 51:02.860
Don't go into the caves?

51:02.860 --> 51:04.680
Come on.

51:04.680 --> 51:08.340
We could split into two groups and check both of them.

51:08.340 --> 51:12.100
That's what we're demanding happens here.

51:12.100 --> 51:14.180
You need to figure out which group you're in.

51:14.180 --> 51:19.540
If you want to die or go into the dark cave, I guess I don't know if it's death.

51:19.540 --> 51:22.020
If you, if you want to get out of here, you go through the caves.

51:22.020 --> 51:26.020
If you, if you just want to explore the forest more, go up there, I guess.

51:26.020 --> 51:29.820
I'm going to go with Roger because I've been with him through so much already.

51:29.820 --> 51:30.820
You fucking idiot.

51:30.820 --> 51:39.340
I was like, I don't know what I rolled.

51:39.340 --> 51:42.620
I know what I think is happening.

51:42.620 --> 51:50.660
Walter, honestly, you're, I don't know what happened before this.

51:50.660 --> 51:51.780
Look at me.

51:51.780 --> 51:55.180
I don't know what we were before this.

51:55.180 --> 51:58.060
Do you have the memory of us in the flower room?

51:58.060 --> 52:00.940
I think that we should split up.

52:00.940 --> 52:03.860
It's time for me to go on my own.

52:03.860 --> 52:10.220
And you see Alan Grimes face just drops literally of sadness.

52:10.220 --> 52:11.220
It doesn't fall off.

52:11.220 --> 52:15.220
No, it doesn't fall on his face.

52:15.220 --> 52:16.220
There's no fake faces.

52:16.220 --> 52:20.460
In this one, there will be in the next one.

52:20.460 --> 52:25.900
I know you don't like dark places and I start walking towards Roger.

52:25.900 --> 52:30.380
Why are all the player characters going to die?

52:30.380 --> 52:32.100
All right.

52:32.100 --> 52:37.620
I walk off through the light in the woods.

52:37.620 --> 52:43.660
Alan Grimes looks back at you, Walter, as you're walking away from him.

52:43.660 --> 52:48.580
If you turn back, you see a single tear is falling from his eye.

52:48.580 --> 52:53.980
I honestly, I don't know that you were my son.

52:53.980 --> 52:57.060
But I thought of you as my son.

52:57.060 --> 53:00.620
I'll see you at the end, dad.

53:00.620 --> 53:05.020
I don't want that loser going with me.

53:05.020 --> 53:13.220
Why don't you go into the caves and Alan Grimes just stands there and kind of shook, not wanting

53:13.220 --> 53:17.220
to offend anyone, but clearly not wanted by either group.

53:17.220 --> 53:18.220
Yeah.

53:18.220 --> 53:22.060
Go into the caves, you feckless, perhaps sunless piece of shit.

53:22.060 --> 53:24.060
Jesus Christ.

53:24.060 --> 53:28.580
Well, I've got a cube to launch.

53:28.580 --> 53:32.800
I can't deal with this shit any longer and I certainly can't deal with you.

53:32.800 --> 53:43.340
I don't know, but based on my memories, I am not, I don't think I am a good person and

53:43.340 --> 53:46.300
I don't know if I deserve to leave.

53:46.300 --> 53:47.300
All right.

53:47.380 --> 53:51.340
Well, why don't you go fight that worm monster single-handedly and let the rest of us get

53:51.340 --> 53:52.340
the fuck out of there.

53:52.340 --> 53:57.180
As you're saying that to each other, he is walking back down the trail away from you

53:57.180 --> 53:59.740
all back toward like calm.

53:59.740 --> 54:02.420
That affects Martin in no way.

54:02.420 --> 54:07.660
Walter feels really, really sad for the first time ever.

54:07.660 --> 54:09.200
It fills you.

54:09.200 --> 54:12.780
These emotions are running wild within you.

54:12.780 --> 54:18.180
I like get down, like drop to my knees and I actually start to cry.

54:18.180 --> 54:22.300
And actual tears are pouring from your eyes.

54:22.300 --> 54:24.300
Watch your electronics.

54:24.300 --> 54:26.900
Walter, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's okay.

54:26.900 --> 54:30.460
He wasn't, it sounds like he wasn't really your dad or something.

54:30.460 --> 54:34.940
He, I don't, I just, I don't know what to think.

54:34.940 --> 54:38.260
I, there's just so much going on.

54:38.260 --> 54:40.460
I just can't compute it all.

54:40.460 --> 54:41.460
It's...

54:41.460 --> 54:42.460
Roger's going to try and comfort you.

54:43.140 --> 54:44.740
I mean, there's this kid crying in front of him.

54:44.740 --> 54:49.940
Charles Digby only knows how to comfort things in one way, which is patted on the head.

54:49.940 --> 54:50.940
Like his pet cat.

54:50.940 --> 55:00.380
He's like, it'll be okay, but he does like a pat on the head and he's like, Hey, Hey,

55:00.380 --> 55:02.380
Hey, it'll be okay.

55:02.380 --> 55:03.840
I've got a little bit of persuade.

55:03.840 --> 55:06.380
Is there a role that I would do to like comfort somebody?

55:06.380 --> 55:08.460
So psychotherapy would be comfort.

55:08.460 --> 55:09.460
I don't have any of that.

55:09.460 --> 55:10.460
You got 10%.

55:10.460 --> 55:11.460
I got 10%.

55:11.460 --> 55:12.460
Let's fucking do this.

55:12.460 --> 55:13.460
Okay.

55:13.460 --> 55:14.460
I quit.

55:14.460 --> 55:20.460
Smack him on top of the head.

55:20.460 --> 55:21.460
Bad.

55:21.460 --> 55:22.460
I failed.

55:22.460 --> 55:23.460
Also.

55:23.460 --> 55:24.460
Yeah.

55:24.460 --> 55:25.460
Yeah.

55:25.460 --> 55:27.460
Slap yourself together.

55:27.460 --> 55:28.460
Yeah.

55:28.460 --> 55:33.380
He like hits me in the head and I just get down.

55:33.380 --> 55:35.420
I pat you too hard where it's like not comfortable.

55:35.420 --> 55:40.100
I'm just like completely prone facing the crook of my elbow crying.

55:41.460 --> 55:57.500
Pooper Tino, fuck that guy fart and pooper Tino fucking got him.

55:57.500 --> 56:00.440
We fucking got him guys.

56:00.440 --> 56:03.820
What's going to work teamwork.

56:03.820 --> 56:05.740
That's from the wonder pets.

56:05.740 --> 56:06.740
That's cool.

56:06.740 --> 56:16.620
I need to hear stuff in the room that I know I'm going to edit out later.

56:16.620 --> 56:18.460
Who's leading the charge into this cave.

56:18.460 --> 56:19.460
I assume it's Roger Fairfield.

56:19.460 --> 56:20.460
It's gotta be Roger.

56:20.460 --> 56:22.300
He's a he meant about this game.

56:22.300 --> 56:27.540
So Walter, you've just been consoled very poorly by two grown men.

56:27.540 --> 56:36.420
When I was a scalped man, when I hear them walking towards the cave, I kind of just like

56:36.420 --> 56:41.700
look over and for a split second I try to decide if I'm going to the cave or running

56:41.700 --> 56:45.840
after my dad, but I realized I've made that decision.

56:45.840 --> 56:49.860
I get up and there's like dirt and mud all over my face and I start following them into

56:49.860 --> 56:50.860
the cave.

56:50.860 --> 56:56.480
The cave opening is large enough for two or three people to go in at a time.

56:56.480 --> 56:57.480
It's not too small.

56:57.480 --> 57:01.740
There are a lot of caves around here in Missouri that the entrance to the cave is literally

57:01.740 --> 57:04.700
like you dive in head first and your feet go in the air.

57:04.700 --> 57:05.700
It's not one of those.

57:05.980 --> 57:06.980
It's like the smallest cave.

57:06.980 --> 57:07.980
Exactly.

57:07.980 --> 57:12.020
Like the largest cave opening in the world.

57:12.020 --> 57:17.380
This one, you can, you can easily like kind of a crab crawl on your, on your hands and

57:17.380 --> 57:25.380
the palms behind you kind of into it and scooch on your butt into a pretty large opening immediately

57:25.380 --> 57:30.380
where you hear the drops of water and the distance.

57:30.380 --> 57:32.120
And besides that, you hear nothing.

57:32.120 --> 57:34.260
This cave system is moist.

57:34.820 --> 57:36.480
Do we have mites and tights?

57:36.480 --> 57:38.460
It is much colder here.

57:38.460 --> 57:41.140
You got mites and tights for days.

57:41.140 --> 57:45.500
Far more tights than mites at this first opening area.

57:45.500 --> 57:50.060
So you're kind of dodging them with your mouth and making sure that no of the drip drops

57:50.060 --> 57:53.780
get in your grill as you, as you scooch down in.

57:53.780 --> 57:56.380
But then you can kind of stand up and you're standing on this.

57:56.380 --> 58:03.900
It kind of looks like a tongue almost the way that it is like going in texture or shape.

58:03.900 --> 58:09.660
It's both, I would say it's both, it's smooth and wet and there's a line down the middle

58:09.660 --> 58:14.460
and you can kind of like put one foot on each side as you move forward.

58:14.460 --> 58:17.780
And the light behind you is the only thing guiding you for now.

58:17.780 --> 58:20.500
Do you guys have any lighters or anything on you?

58:20.500 --> 58:24.740
I'd assume Charles Digby might be a smoker, but that's just an assumption.

58:24.740 --> 58:25.740
Yeah.

58:25.740 --> 58:27.340
Because he went to be incognito.

58:27.340 --> 58:28.340
Exactly.

58:28.340 --> 58:30.340
He smokes a lot.

58:30.340 --> 58:33.400
I put my arm out like this.

58:33.400 --> 58:34.400
Like what?

58:34.400 --> 58:37.320
Forearm phasing up, palm up.

58:37.320 --> 58:48.400
And I like touch in the crook of my elbow and my eyes light up a little bit and it projects

58:48.400 --> 58:49.400
some light.

58:49.400 --> 58:55.060
Uh, that doesn't happen, but you think it does as you put your finger there, then let

58:55.060 --> 58:57.880
me do something else.

58:57.880 --> 58:58.880
Do I notice?

58:58.880 --> 59:02.640
You guys look over and is he like holding still and he's like doing it.

59:02.640 --> 59:07.480
You guys look over and Walter is holding his thumb over the crook of his elbow and he's

59:07.480 --> 59:10.760
like blinking really intensely and he's confused.

59:10.760 --> 59:11.760
Hey bud.

59:11.760 --> 59:12.760
What?

59:12.760 --> 59:13.760
What?

59:13.760 --> 59:14.760
Are you, what are you doing there?

59:14.760 --> 59:17.560
This should be working, but what should be working?

59:17.560 --> 59:18.640
Never mind.

59:18.640 --> 59:21.760
I look at Roger and I was like, this kid's got some fucking screws loose.

59:21.760 --> 59:23.000
There's something wrong that's certain.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.680
We gotta take care of him.

59:24.680 --> 59:27.200
You guys have like a flashlight or a lighter or anything?

59:27.200 --> 59:28.920
I whip out a little Zippo.

59:28.920 --> 59:35.840
Yeah and the Zippo is enough in this like pitch darkness to expose a large opening ahead

59:35.840 --> 59:42.600
of you and there it, it gets smaller and smaller and the distance about 25 yards away.

59:42.600 --> 59:50.240
And then there's another opening down there and you, uh, you see there seems to be a path

59:50.240 --> 59:52.220
laid out from here to there.

59:52.220 --> 59:54.560
Almost like people have been through here before.

59:54.560 --> 59:58.480
I'll lead the way and I hold the lighter kind of in front while guiding them.

59:58.480 --> 59:59.480
I'll follow.

59:59.480 --> 01:00:00.480
Same.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:07.600
And as you're going forward, you notice that you're now only lit by the slider.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:12.560
When you turn back around, you see no natural light coming from behind you.

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:16.880
Guys, there's, didn't we just come from that direction?

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:23.200
I don't, I don't see, I don't see the, is there wind kicking in that's making the flame

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.160
go a certain way or is it still air?

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.520
It is still air.

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:31.040
Some of the stalactites must be in the, blocking the light.

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.400
Let's just forge on.

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.080
Yeah, let's press on I guess.

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:36.080
Yeah.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:40.040
I think Roger right now is a little bit maybe wondering if he read the map right, but he's

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.040
still going.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:46.080
So you guys go into this next little opening and there is a slide down.

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:50.320
It's a, there's a bunch of different rocks and stuff, but it's been smoothed out over

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.320
time.

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:56.760
There seems to be water trickling in this area just to your left and just to your right,

01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:03.280
but there's a rock kind of stairway leading down a little bit and you notice that you're

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:11.600
now in a room that is probably 40 yards by 40 yards and at least 40 yards high as well.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:15.400
And you're like up at the top currently looking down into it.

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:18.960
And earlier you said that there are signs that this is a used pathway.

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.360
People have been here, yeah, for sure.

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:23.800
I say, I'm, I think, I think we're going the right way guys.

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:26.080
There's, there's, there's signs that people have been through here.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.080
Everyone has to be down here.

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:28.080
Let's, let's keep going.

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:29.080
Let's go.

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.560
Do you guys think Rollo will recognize me?

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:33.560
Without your hair.

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:34.560
Without the hair.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.560
Oh yeah.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:36.560
How's that?

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.560
How's that feeling?

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:38.560
Feels bad.

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.560
There's not a lot of skin up there.

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:46.400
So you guys make your way down into making our way down to making your way down into

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.640
this part of the cave in your home now forever.

01:01:49.640 --> 01:02:05.920
So you guys get down this little like rock kind of stairwell and you realize your clothes

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:07.480
are getting muddier and muddier.

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:12.880
It's much cooler now than it was when you were out back in the woods.

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:18.720
Obviously you're in a fucking cave, roughly 52 degrees is what I'm thinking Fahrenheit.

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:23.560
I was just watching a formula, it doesn't matter, but I was watching drive to survive

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:27.640
the formula one Netflix show and they were like, yeah, it's fucking hot.

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.580
It's 32 degrees.

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:34.520
And I was like, ah, Americans, we're idiots.

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.520
Whoops.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:40.720
Anyway, so you guys make it down and it is for our international listeners.

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:41.720
That's 11.1 degrees.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:48.120
Yeah, it's like 11.1 degrees Celsius and thank you, Luke.

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:55.120
As we're wandering around and passing the time, I'm like, Hey bud, why do you, do you

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:57.280
think you're a robot?

01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.340
Cause no, no, no.

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:04.280
We need to, if he's going to be with us, we got to know what's happening upstairs with

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.280
him.

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.280
He's right.

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.280
Were you trying to do something?

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.280
Were you pressing into your arm?

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.280
What were you doing?

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:12.880
I'm not supposed to say, I think you should say, I saw whenever we were in that meeting

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:17.600
room together, you like shut down when someone touched under your chin.

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.600
What was that?

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:22.800
I, my dad, he's your, he's your not dad.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:26.520
My dad made me, are you talking about Alan made you?

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:27.520
Yeah.

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.520
I am.

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:29.800
We're pretty sure now that he isn't your dad.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.120
Is that, isn't that right?

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:37.080
I mean, in a way he is, but I'm, I was never born.

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:41.100
When you said he made you, did you mean that in the way that you mean that he made you?

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:42.140
You think he made you?

01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:43.360
I know that he did.

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:44.360
He built you.

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:45.360
He built me.

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.720
But I don't, I don't think that's, I don't think that's right.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.720
I don't think he built you.

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:52.960
I don't think a robot could cry like you did back there.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:57.920
Well, I came to this Island to see if I could pass as real.

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:04.200
So I guess one good thing out of this is that it worked, but you are, you are, you are real

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.200
Walter.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.720
You're, you're not a maid thing.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:13.800
You you're cyborgs aren't real, but then I'm not real, but you are real.

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:16.040
And I, uh, I want to pinch his arm.

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.200
You can feel that, right?

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:20.200
I was programmed to feel, oh boy.

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:26.680
When you got touched under the chin and you shut down, what did that feel like to you?

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:29.440
I just black out or sleep, I guess.

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:36.200
And sometimes I just can't move well from our perspective.

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:42.400
You just closed your eyes, but what did you think happened?

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.480
I shut down.

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:47.640
I, my dad made me and there's, there's more of me.

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.520
He was going to sell me.

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:54.880
And you get hit with a memory from before you were at calm, comfy campground.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:05:01.880
You're in a cage and you're in a warehouse and it smells, it's fucking musty.

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:06.140
Like a junior high locker room that was abandoned over summer break.

01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:14.660
This warehouse is filled with these cages, cramped, rusty, covered in a layer of condensation

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:16.060
due to the humidity.

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:20.240
And each cage has a kid in it, roughly your age.

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:25.740
And there must be hundreds of you all stacked three cages high, separated just enough to

01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:33.860
limit physical contact and walking through the maze of cages and this vile warehouse

01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:42.100
is Alan Grimes, followed by a few men who are hanging on his every word.

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:44.900
Some are orphans, some were collected from the streets.

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:49.540
Others had parents who were more than willing to trade them for drugs.

01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:52.940
And that's where the learning center comes in.

01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:55.940
These kids have no place in this world.

01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:58.380
They do not exist.

01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:05.460
And they could, therefore, be extremely useful to each of your organizations.

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:06.460
Uh.

01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:11.740
You all right, Walter?

01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:17.800
Is he like completely dazed out right now?

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:23.980
It feels like my mind is broken for a second and then I have to get back to Alan.

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:28.140
And I start like clawing at the wall, like jumping and clawing at the wall.

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:35.540
And the camera zooms out as we see Walter Grimes just clawing, mud, pulling up in his

01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:41.100
nail beds as he's trying to get through this wall.

01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:47.500
And we see Charles Digby and Roger Fairfield just take a step back and watch.

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:51.380
And you are now in this even larger room.

01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:53.260
You can roll search if you want.

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:54.480
I do.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:55.480
Search or survival?

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:56.480
Search.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.480
I'm gonna do search.

01:06:58.480 --> 01:06:59.480
Success.

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:00.480
Uh, success.

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.480
I success.

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:08.400
With all of you succeeding, you each look around and the stairs that you just took down

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:12.600
here that kind of like carved out stairs that made you think that this has been traveled

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:17.200
before are no longer there.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:23.800
And it is just a smooth slide that goes at like an 11 degree angle straight up and then

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:30.440
surrounding you on the other side are equally tall walls about 40 yards high and you are

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:37.400
lit only by this very still flame that is casting each of your shadows onto these walls

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.400
surrounding you.

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:41.120
But is there no, no break in the walls anymore?

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:42.120
Roll Sanity.

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.120
Uh oh.

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.120
Uh oh.

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:46.120
Seven.

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:47.120
This seems fine.

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:48.120
Uh, 14.

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:49.120
I'm fine too.

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:51.120
Yeah, you guys just can't see it.

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:52.120
Oh shit.

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.120
Then yeah, you guys are fine.

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:57.360
You just can't, you just can't see it right now, but you just haven't found it yet.

01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.360
It's no big deal.

01:07:58.360 --> 01:07:59.360
Oh.

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:00.360
Uh, yeah.

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.960
Roger is going to start running his hand on the nearest wall and going in a perimeter.

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.360
Yeah, it won't take long.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.360
We'll find, I'll find it eventually.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:06.360
Yeah, exactly.

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:07.360
Yeah.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.640
We're kind of like, Oh, I feel like since it's so, is it just like pitch black except

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:10.640
the lighter?

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:11.640
Exactly.

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:12.640
Have you guys read yellow wallpaper?

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.640
The short story?

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:14.640
A long time ago.

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:15.640
Yeah.

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:16.640
This is reminding me very much of this.

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:23.480
So I will just cut to a scene where the three of you are all like conga line style basically

01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:26.880
with the lighter in front, holding your hands up to the wall.

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:27.880
Exactly.

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:34.540
And as we pan out, we see that the handprints that have been going around this room have

01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:44.080
been going time and time and time and time in memoriam and you've made smooth hand prints

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:50.240
all across this wall repeatedly for who knows how long.

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:53.320
Holy fucking shit.

01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:55.320
Fuck.

01:08:55.320 --> 01:09:08.400
What's Martin Cupertino thinking as he leaves these three, four even, and heads above the

01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:11.560
cave off through the opening in the trees?

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:12.560
Nothing in particular.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:16.620
He's just completely, he doesn't have a single doubt about his own rightness.

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:23.040
And then all of a sudden, as you're walking, you just stop because you run into a wall.

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.440
Literally.

01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:25.880
It's like there's a wall in reality.

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:26.880
Yeah.

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:29.320
I can see like forest through the other side, but I bulk it.

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:30.320
Yeah.

01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:35.920
And then as you like reach out for it, you can tell that it is this like energy that

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.880
you can't quite move through.

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:38.880
Okay.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:42.200
I would like to meditate and get in tune with this energy.

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.800
Full power.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:47.600
23 on a 50.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:53.460
After a short period of meditation, you open your eyes back up and you can very clearly

01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:59.880
see where this wall goes up and looking up behind you, you see that it creates a dome

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:03.900
over the sky above you and you're on the very edge of it now.

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:09.040
And just to your right, there's a little opening where there is no energy.

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.720
I'd like to walk through that.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:17.120
As you walk through the opening, this headache that you didn't even realize that you necessarily

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:24.440
had just dissipates and you feel free for the first time and you don't know how long.

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:29.320
And you do exactly what Thomas just did, which was exhale and like roll your eyes back in

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.320
the head.

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.320
Pleasure.

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.320
Okay.

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:38.320
Martin immediately takes out his 90s cell phone and he calls the secretary.

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:43.120
Bring bring bring bring Cupertino's office.

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.040
Why do you sound like Jack Russell?

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:50.040
Cupertino's office.

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.440
Cupertino's office.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:52.840
You know who the fuck this is?

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:53.840
What fucking year is it?

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:54.840
Oh my God.

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:55.840
Martin.

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:56.840
What year is it?

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:58.840
It's 26 years ago.

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.200
Everyone knows that.

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:05.920
He takes a deep sigh of relief.

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:07.040
Perfect.

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:10.240
I'm still 26 years in the future.

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:11.840
Well, 26.3.

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:13.360
That's what I've calculated.

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.640
It's cube about to launch.

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:17.840
It hasn't been postponed yet, but is it ready?

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:26.240
Yes, it's it's going to launch cube and send me a fucking helicopter.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.240
Hey, you won.

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:36.240
Yeah, I've never done that in a dream.

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:41.120
Roger Fairfield, Charles Digby, Alan Grimes and Walter Grimes, you're all sitting in a

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:47.320
half circle in the meeting room about to have orientation and a man walks in wearing a white

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:52.560
button down shirt, gray slacks and black dress shoes and he sits at the chair in front of

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.680
you and he says, hello there everyone.

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:58.800
My name is James and I am the executive director here.

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:02.480
Welcome to calm, comfy campground.

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:06.160
Oh, what the fuck?

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:09.640
Fuck you, Zach.

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:12.680
What the fuck?

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:14.480
I don't understand.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.800
I feel like Clark could benefit a lot from this, but he doesn't know it.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:33.920
What's up everybody?

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:34.960
It's Zach.

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:39.200
So the world is pretty wild right now.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:42.520
Before I address how we're handling it here at pretending to be people, I just want to

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:49.800
say we wish you all the best during these unprecedented times for me personally, yesterday

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:53.960
COVID-19 hit a bit closer to home than I'd have liked.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:58.960
My dad had just finished a 14 day quarantine after coming into contact with someone who

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:05.400
is Corona positive and the symptoms hit him like a truck on day 15.

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:09.940
This thing is real and it fucking sucks.

01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:16.520
Please stay home, wash your hands and if you're young and staying safe, please offer to make

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:21.260
grocery and pharmacy runs for the older and immunocompromised in your lives.

01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:24.440
We can make it through this mess together.

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:29.620
I know it's hard to stop touching your face, so maybe wear gloves that you've dipped into

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:33.000
spoiled milk and let dry in the sun.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.260
Maybe that.

01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:39.080
So we are currently waiting on the rest of our equipment to come in the mail so we can

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:41.620
begin recording remotely.

01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:46.220
We've never done this before, so we might be taking a week off to figure out the logistics,

01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:51.100
but my hope is to put out this Q and A episode Friday, April 3rd.

01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:55.540
So post those questions on the thread in the subreddit ASAP and as for our patrons

01:13:55.540 --> 01:14:00.060
over on Patreon, I will make an announcement once all our equipment is in and we have everything

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:06.020
set up and we know what we're actually doing, but we are so looking forward to making your

01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:09.500
patronage really worth its belt size.

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:14.840
For those of you who don't know, I work as the director of human resources and community

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:20.880
outreach for a small business that owns five bars and I bartend a couple nights a week

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:23.680
as well for extra money.

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:29.800
The main thing I did was plan big events.

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:34.460
But even with all this shit, I'm not as worried as I probably should be.

01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:41.640
These moments of crisis bring out a compassion and empathy in people that is so heartening.

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:45.040
So if you have the ability, please take this time.

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:50.280
Reach out to an elderly neighbor, Venmo a friend who's in the service industry, Zoom

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:55.720
with your family and friends and let them know how much you love them.

01:14:55.720 --> 01:15:03.040
There are three more story arcs left in this campaign, and I am so absolutely fucking stoked

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.440
to see what happens.

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:09.040
I love you all, thank you so much for listening and supporting the show.

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:45.040
Thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
