1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,580
Skip a bop, a skibbity bop, a wee dee dee dee dee dee, a skip skibbity skip skip, it's

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:15,760
Scatman Wolf, y'all, hittin' you from bleeba deeba 694.2 PTBP, my jazzy babies, and I am

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,800
hittin' you live from the past and the present, and maybe even the future.

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,060
Time is weird, time is like jazz.

5
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,260
It's all made up, and no one fuckin' understands it.

6
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,140
Speaking of things I don't understand and I'm forced to do, this week's Howlin'

7
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,360
with Wolf is from Brittany Roxanne, who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending

8
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,360
pod.

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,020
Seriously, what a pleasant thing to do, they write, I have an urgent message for Hurt Ork.

10
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:54,860
Your message is simple, infiltrate the enemy, gather intel, and report back what you find.

11
00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:01,180
If your cover's blown, do not, under any circumstances, contact us.

12
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,060
Good luck, Agent.

13
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:10,540
Uh, this seems like a weird avenue to deliver super secret urgent messages to people.

14
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:18,140
I hope Hurt Ork accomplishes whatever the mission was, unless that mission is to infiltrate

15
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,060
my home and gather intel on little ol' me?

16
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:28,940
Hey, producer, beef up the security around here, you salty salt dog.

17
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,180
If you see some Ork who was hurt, you know what to do.

18
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,740
Hey, do you like this show?

19
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,580
Do you wanna help this show?

20
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,580
Do you even think we deserve it?

21
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:46,820
Patreon.com slash PretendingPod, at PretendingPod on Twitter and Instagram, Reddit.com slash

22
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:52,900
all slash PretendingToBePeople, write a review on Apple Podcasts, why don't ya?

23
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:59,300
Let the congregation say amen, an elf, a dwarf, and a wizard.

24
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:05,100
Blessed are the measures that light the fuse, let's erupt the oppressors and we'll write

25
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,980
the news.

26
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:13,180
The PCs all woke up feeling strange and finding they'd been pricked in their veins right in

27
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,060
the pit of their elbows.

28
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,180
Hmm, elbows, the knees of the arms.

29
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:26,060
Zack fucked up Justin's reaction to failing his constitution check, and I'll bet it never

30
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,820
comes up again.

31
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,420
Seriously, he just thought Justin succeeded that check for some reason.

32
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,660
Hmm, he must've been all nervous and shit.

33
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,940
What a dumb motherfucker.

34
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:43,340
Anyway, Martin twisted his ankle in the go bag hiding place he had previously covered

35
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,540
up and he found the go bag was missing.

36
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:51,820
He also cannot remember arriving here at calm, comfy campground.

37
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:58,380
Walter and Alan discussed who to trust, deciding they could only trust each other.

38
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:05,140
However, Walter no longer trusts Alan due to his memory of Alan trying to sell him.

39
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,700
Charles Digby had a knock at the door.

40
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:13,580
The bellboy Leon was looking for Jack Russell and Jack Russell was hiding under the floor.

41
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,580
They talked about an inoculation and Digby promised he wouldn't snitch.

42
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:23,740
Roger Fairfield realized he'd been drugged and found a hair tie near the open window

43
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,340
that was locked and closed when he had gone to sleep.

44
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,660
The hair seemed to match a young girl named Maggie who ran from James to Angela while

45
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,220
calling her Ann.

46
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,220
Hmm, nothing suspicious there.

47
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:43,020
In the meeting room, Angela was called out into the hallway by James.

48
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,820
Inside tensions rose.

49
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,300
Walter tried to turn himself off after Martin violated his personal space.

50
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:55,060
Walter came back with a throat punch that gave Thomas permission to do whatever he's

51
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,060
doing.

52
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,100
This week I got exactly what your soul desires.

53
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:07,540
A brand new song, a premiere, a future classic, a modern myth, a song that makes you feel

54
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,220
the right kind of wrong.

55
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:16,380
It's Dream Girl, my babies, with Pretty Sexual.

56
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:45,940
This is real, I dream I knew I'd make you be foolish

57
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:52,060
Thomas Martin Cupertino just got fucking rocked in the throat by Walter Grimes.

58
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:57,660
And all of a sudden you're sitting in a chair in a room, it's a pretty small room but it's

59
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:04,420
made to feel even smaller because it is filled with flowers.

60
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:10,900
So many flowers of all different varieties, shades and shapes that you've never seen before.

61
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:16,260
Sitting right in front of you is James, the executive director of Calm Comfy Campground

62
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:21,860
sitting behind a desk and he has a folder in front of him and he looks up at you.

63
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:28,100
Martin, go ahead and tell me a little bit more about Cube, I'm curious.

64
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:35,580
Because of the state that your brain is in currently, go ahead and roll Constitution

65
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,260
at a negative 40.

66
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,860
Well 80, so I failed that, but I also didn't have much chance, I have a 55, so.

67
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,500
Oh shit, yeah, that would have been rough.

68
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:54,100
So you, maybe for the first time in your life, maybe for the first time in a long time you

69
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,980
feel docile almost, you feel so pliant.

70
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:06,580
Well I mean, I'm not supposed to talk about Cube, but I'll let you in on a little secret,

71
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:12,420
yeah, you can know about Cube before the rest of the world, basically Cube is just a really

72
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:19,100
expensive personal computer, looks like a jellybean, obviously modeled pretty heavily

73
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,700
on the iMac, which was the thing in the late 90s.

74
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,540
Really it's just all marketing baby, that's all Cube is.

75
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:34,220
And how much money projected do you think that Cube is going to net?

76
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,780
If a sucker's born every minute then quite a bit, my calculations seem to show it's more

77
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:44,940
like 48.5 seconds, that's of course rising exponentially with global population, but

78
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,580
once we reach the crest of that, really you need to get in now within 30 years when the

79
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,180
population of western nations are plummeting and the markets aren't there yet in the developing

80
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:00,620
nations, there's just not going to be as many fools per capita to sell to, you really want

81
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,820
to get in right now.

82
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,820
Well consider-

83
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,780
On the verge of this new gilded age.

84
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,780
Me sold.

85
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,780
Sold.

86
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,420
You want to buy a Cube?

87
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:16,020
He flips open the folder and there's a thick stack of documents in there.

88
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,020
Please.

89
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,140
What do you get, what's that, what do you have there?

90
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:30,540
And he holds a pen out to you and you see on the folder it's titled Operation Hole Puncher.

91
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,920
And inside there's document after document after document and he hands you a pen and

92
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,180
he needs you to sign at the bottom of every page.

93
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:46,180
It's like, yeah, I'll sign whatever.

94
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,180
Is this ASMR?

95
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,540
Do you like that?

96
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,700
Man sits next to you and clicks pen, obnoxious.

97
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:00,780
I'm clicking my pen right now for you.

98
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,340
This is the worst.

99
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,340
It's the worst.

100
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:10,580
You're going to have to go to the Patreon to get that content, our ASMR Patreon feed.

101
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,820
Oh no.

102
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,500
Zach DM's you to sleep with.

103
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
Oh my god.

104
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,540
You're going to have to roll sanity for me.

105
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,540
For me.

106
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:27,500
You always say roll for me, which is like, seems a little bit like self-aggrandizing.

107
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:32,580
Roll it for me.

108
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,540
All right, Justin.

109
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:40,260
You were in the meeting room a second ago, wait, you're sitting in this room.

110
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,260
It's small.

111
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:47,740
It's made to feel even smaller by the overwhelming amount of flowers in this room.

112
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:53,540
Sitting across from you at a desk is James, the executive director of Calm Comfy Campground.

113
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:58,100
He's looking through a folder and he looks up at you and these flowers that are all around

114
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,220
you are the same flowers that you've seen all over the island.

115
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,220
What color are they?

116
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:09,180
All different kinds of colors, all different kinds of shapes, varied in many different

117
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,180
ways.

118
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,900
Charles, you take pictures, right?

119
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,900
Part of your job?

120
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,420
Yeah, pretty much.

121
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,820
That's almost all I do these days.

122
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,940
And you've got some pretty damning pictures of some fairly important people.

123
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,940
Is that correct?

124
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,120
Yeah, I can't quite say who, but yeah.

125
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,120
We know who.

126
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,620
And he's flipping through this folder.

127
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:38,100
Charles, you feel, go ahead and roll a constitution at a negative 40.

128
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,500
Oh, that's going to be hard.

129
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,500
What's your constitution?

130
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
55.

131
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Oh boy.

132
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Oh, I crit failed, 55.

133
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,180
It would have been a great success if you wouldn't have fucked me like that, Zach.

134
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,060
It wasn't me that fucked you.

135
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:03,420
You immediately list the people.

136
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:10,300
There was the mayor, there was this actor guy that people around here know, there was

137
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,060
a radio DJ, there was a city council member.

138
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,060
All right, all right.

139
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,060
Calm down.

140
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,060
Calm down.

141
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,060
I know.

142
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,060
Charles Digby's like, wait, why did I?

143
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,060
It's okay, Charles.

144
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,060
Why?

145
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,060
You're working with us now.

146
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,060
I need you to sign these here documents.

147
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:31,500
We're working together now as a team and we're going to need those pictures.

148
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,380
Yeah, whatever you need.

149
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:40,580
And you walk up to the desk and he's got this folder that says Operation Hole Puncher on

150
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,580
it.

151
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,700
And then he flips it open and there is a thick stack of documents there.

152
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,700
All right.

153
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,580
If you'll just sign and initial all these.

154
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,580
I'm doing it.

155
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,580
I'm getting in there very quickly.

156
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:56,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

157
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,580
All right.

158
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,580
Thank you for your time.

159
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,580
Thank you.

160
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,580
Oh no.

161
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,580
Oh no.

162
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,580
I don't like where the-

163
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:08,940
Roger, you were in that meeting room.

164
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,780
Walter just like goes to punch, wait, no, you're sitting in this room.

165
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:19,100
It's a small room and you're surrounded by flowers of every shape and shade.

166
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,380
They're the exact same flowers you've been seeing all over this island, but you're not

167
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,700
sure if this is a memory.

168
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,580
It feels like a memory.

169
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:33,280
It's a small room, but it's even smaller because of how many flowers are just surrounding you

170
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,740
in every direction.

171
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:40,620
And in front of you, there's a desk and behind that desk is James, executive director of

172
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,940
the calm comfy campground.

173
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:47,420
I need you to roll constitution at a negative 40.

174
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,780
Oof.

175
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,020
Dang.

176
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,260
43 on what would be a 30.

177
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,140
Roger, you were an archeologist.

178
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,140
Is that right?

179
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,140
Yeah.

180
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,140
Yeah.

181
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,140
And you're single, right?

182
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,140
Yeah.

183
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,140
Yeah.

184
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,780
And what is this dig site you're working on right now?

185
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:09,060
I mean, we don't exactly know it, but we're just calling it the nameless city right now.

186
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,980
We don't know exactly what civilization it belonged to.

187
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,300
We just found it.

188
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,300
Interesting.

189
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,300
Interesting.

190
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,300
All right.

191
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,300
Cool.

192
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,460
Well, basically today we're just here to sign some paperwork so that our partnership can

193
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,460
continue.

194
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,460
Yeah.

195
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,460
That sound good?

196
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,460
Sure.

197
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,460
Yeah, of course.

198
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,540
And you approached the desk where he's got a folder that he opens up and the folder on

199
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,980
the front says operation hole puncher.

200
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,980
Oh, damn.

201
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,940
I got to pull out my other notebooks, Zach.

202
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:44,020
And inside there's a document after document that he has you sign an initial.

203
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,020
Okay.

204
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,020
I do.

205
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,980
And he looks up and he's like, look forward to working more with you.

206
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,060
And you too.

207
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,740
What the fuck?

208
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:04,980
Walter, you reach out and just like slam Martin Cupertino in the throat.

209
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,180
And then all of a sudden you're just standing in this room.

210
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,020
Next to you is Alan Grimes, who you know as your handler.

211
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,400
And in front of him is a desk.

212
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,420
Behind that desk is James, executive director at Calm Comfy Campground.

213
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:27,000
This room is filled with flowers of all different shade and shape.

214
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,820
It's the exact same flowers that are covering the Island where calm comfy campground sits

215
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,240
and you are completely docile.

216
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,620
So Alan, you're saying that you've got more of these.

217
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,620
Yes.

218
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,620
Yes.

219
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,140
I've got, we have warehouses in Washington.

220
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,100
We have warehouses in Chicago, new Orleans, Las Vegas.

221
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,780
We have access to as many as you need.

222
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:57,900
Well, that is, that is something else and they'll just do whatever they'll just do whatever

223
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,900
you want.

224
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,900
Yes.

225
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,900
Yes, absolutely.

226
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,240
Hey, uh, Hey kid, touch your nose.

227
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Walter touches his nose.

228
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,900
Luke touches his nose immediately, but Walter touches his nose.

229
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,900
Oh damn.

230
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,900
That shit's wild.

231
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,900
Slap your face.

232
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,180
Oh, it looks like it hurt.

233
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,180
Yeah.

234
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,180
I liked it.

235
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,180
He slaps his face.

236
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,180
Man.

237
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,580
Man.

238
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,580
All right.

239
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,900
Well, uh, shit.

240
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,160
Let's go ahead and take this partnership to the next level.

241
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,380
Let's sign some paperwork and Alan Grimes approaches the desk where James has a folder

242
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,060
that's labeled operation hole puncher.

243
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,100
And inside there's a bunch of paperwork.

244
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,420
Alan just signs and signs and initials and signs.

245
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,980
Alan turns back to you, salutes.

246
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,140
Thank you for your service.

247
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,180
Thank you.

248
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,180
Bad rolls out of the way.

249
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,180
It's like warming up at the free throw line before the game.

250
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,180
Let's clank a couple.

251
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,180
Visualize the failure.

252
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,180
That's what my mom tells me.

253
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,180
It's a real fucking bummer.

254
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,180
I'm sorry, man.

255
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,180
It's okay.

256
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,180
It's okay.

257
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,220
It's okay.

258
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,220
It's okay.

259
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,220
So in our last alone session, was the minotaur speaking English?

260
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,220
Yeah.

261
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,220
Okay.

262
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,220
Just kidding.

263
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,220
I remember that.

264
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,220
Y'all looked at me.

265
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,220
What the fuck happened to Joe?

266
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,220
Bradley Cooper, you like step back.

267
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:37,220
Like you just got punched in the throat and everyone's eyes just kind of cross each other.

268
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,220
Walter.

269
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,220
I'm sorry.

270
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,220
Just reflexes I guess.

271
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,260
You little bastard.

272
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,260
I didn't.

273
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,260
I didn't.

274
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,260
Cool.

275
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,260
And it's silent.

276
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,260
All right.

277
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,260
Now you're just milking it.

278
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,260
Somebody punch him again.

279
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,260
Walter, you didn't need to punch him.

280
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,260
That was.

281
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,260
What?

282
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,300
I mean, he was a reflex.

283
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,300
He touched me.

284
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,300
He did.

285
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,300
He did.

286
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,300
He did touch you.

287
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,300
That's true.

288
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,300
Are you okay, Brad?

289
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,300
I like walk over to him.

290
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,300
I kind of.

291
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,300
No.

292
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,300
Fuck you kid.

293
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,300
I hate this fucking kid.

294
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,300
I hate this calm, cozy campground.

295
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,300
I'm leaving immediately.

296
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,300
I'm gone.

297
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,300
I want a refund.

298
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,300
Where's James?

299
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,300
Did anyone else just see James somewhere?

300
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,340
I just had a, was it a memory?

301
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:48,340
I'm having these weird flashbacks like we had last night.

302
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,340
That happened to you guys?

303
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,340
Was that a flashback or a dream?

304
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,340
I don't know, but I am so sorry.

305
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,340
I am so sorry, Walter.

306
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,340
I don't know what that was.

307
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:07,340
Walter kind of like squints at his dad and just kind of looks ahead and doesn't say anything else.

308
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,340
I was in a room full of flowers with him.

309
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,380
Were you guys in that room?

310
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,380
It was the flowers all around the island.

311
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,380
That's kind of an old trick.

312
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,380
We'd do it in the waiting room when we had to renegotiate contracts.

313
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,380
You fill it all with flowers so it looks like people really care about you and are thinking about you.

314
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,380
And it just makes the other person feel small.

315
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,380
I pegged it right away.

316
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,380
I definitely felt small in there.

317
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,380
They were.

318
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,380
Like you'd never been sent that many flowers in your life.

319
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,380
They were all around.

320
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,380
It made the room feel smaller.

321
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,420
Boy, whoever got these flowers must be important.

322
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,420
That's really the play there.

323
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,420
At least it was with us.

324
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,420
I think we need to find James.

325
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:53,420
If my recollection of the memory is correct, then I absolutely need to find James.

326
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:58,420
I think last we left off, I was kind of heading toward the door to get Angela back from him.

327
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,420
So I'm probably heading toward that door anyway.

328
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:07,420
Yeah, and when the door opens up, there are two people wearing staff clothing,

329
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:13,460
which you haven't seen before, but it is the calm, comfy campground staff uniform.

330
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:20,460
And it is like a one-piece jumpsuit with a collar that goes all the way up buttoned to the top.

331
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:25,460
It is a tall broad woman and a short scrawny man.

332
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,460
And they both have spray bottles in their hands.

333
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,460
Who the fuck are these boners?

334
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,460
What the fuck is that in their hands?

335
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:36,460
They immediately go to spray the two who are heading straight for the door,

336
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,500
which is Roger Fairfield and Bradley Cooper.

337
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,500
Can I athletics away?

338
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Yeah, you can absolutely try.

339
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,500
Do you want to try to get out of the spray range there, Roger?

340
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
Yeah.

341
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
I fail.

342
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,500
They both fail miserably on their attempt to spray,

343
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
but something about seeing these bottles...

344
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,540
I got an eight on my attempt to help away.

345
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,540
Oh, hell yeah.

346
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,540
How do you get out of the way?

347
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,540
I just straight up like Neo.

348
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:19,540
The Matrix hasn't come out yet, so it's really innovative and revolutionary and shockingly cinematic.

349
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:25,540
But yeah, I just lean back away from the spray, duck behind the guy,

350
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,540
and I want to try to grab the spray out of his hands.

351
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,540
You do grab the spray bottle out of his hands.

352
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,540
Bradley Cooper, Charles Digby, Walter and Ellen Grimes, and Roger Fairfield,

353
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,580
you are all standing together in a cottage.

354
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:42,580
It is familiar because the setup is the same as the cottage each of you have been staying in.

355
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,580
However, this cottage is filled with surveillance equipment.

356
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:50,580
Screens line the walls, and you can see the grounds of Calm Comfy Campground,

357
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,580
the insides of Cottages 3, 5, 7, and 9,

358
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:59,580
as well as, it seems, the forests that surround Lake Calm.

359
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,580
Do I still have the bottle in my hand?

360
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,580
No.

361
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,580
Where are we?

362
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,580
Where the fuck are we?

363
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,620
Everybody roll alertness.

364
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,620
Fail.

365
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,620
69.

366
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,620
Fuck, I fail also.

367
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,620
Ooh, great success.

368
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,620
Ooh, nice.

369
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,620
Success.

370
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,620
Walter, nice.

371
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:23,620
Walter immediately looks down at his arm and sees that there is not a puncture,

372
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,620
like a mark of blood where there was.

373
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,620
Can I see if anybody else still has that?

374
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,620
If they'll show you their arms under their sleeves.

375
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,660
Do you guys still have, look, do you still have your mark?

376
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,660
Let me check.

377
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,660
No one has the mark.

378
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,660
Does it always seem to be the same time of year at Calm Comfy Campground?

379
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,660
It does.

380
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:48,660
And because you Chris Exceed, you actually will see on the surveillance footage.

381
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,660
What surveillance footage?

382
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:56,660
So the screens in front of you are showing all of Calm Comfy Campground essentially,

383
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:03,700
and you see there is a tall, broad woman and a short, scrawny man, both with a bottle

384
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:10,700
in their hand, heading toward a cottage, which you innately feel is this cottage.

385
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,700
We can set an ambush for him, boys.

386
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:18,700
Was the cottage, there was one that had like a tent, like a spray tent or whatever.

387
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,700
Sure.

388
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,700
Do we see that on the surveillance?

389
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,700
No.

390
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,700
Looking out the window, do I see it draped in a tent?

391
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,700
No.

392
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,700
Oh.

393
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,740
Which cottage do you think we're in?

394
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,740
Probably the one that was tinted.

395
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,740
What did you say, three, five, seven, nine?

396
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,740
Those are the ones you can see on the footage, yeah.

397
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,740
Which one was tinted?

398
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,740
Five was me, right?

399
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,740
Yes.

400
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,740
I was in nine.

401
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,740
I was in three, I believe.

402
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,740
And seven.

403
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,740
Yeah.

404
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,740
Those are the four that you guys are in, yeah.

405
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,740
Yeah, I think we're in that tinted cottage.

406
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,740
So is it before it was tinted or after it was tinted and then taken down?

407
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,740
No way to know yet, but it looks like we've got the jump on these fools.

408
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,740
We can see them coming.

409
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,780
What do you think they're doing with those bottles?

410
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,780
They're going to subdue us.

411
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,780
When you grabbed it, could you tell what was in it?

412
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:06,780
No, it's like some kind of controlling force sped us away from that moment before I could

413
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,780
investigate any further on that awesome roll I got.

414
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,780
It was a success.

415
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,780
What do you suggest that we do?

416
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,780
Well, I think you should go out to greet them.

417
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,780
Okay.

418
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,780
Wait.

419
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,780
Don't just greet them.

420
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,780
Run to the door.

421
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,780
Tell them to get in quick.

422
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,780
Tell them there's an emergency.

423
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,820
We'll wait in the hallways in the crevices.

424
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,820
We're going to, we're going to jump these fools.

425
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,820
Okay.

426
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,820
How far away?

427
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,820
Roger real quick wants to look around this room for anything that he can use to, uh,

428
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,820
uh, if we do subdue them to be able to tie them up.

429
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,820
So like cording or roping.

430
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,820
Hold towels in front of yourself so they can't spray you.

431
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,820
Yeah, you can, you can find ties.

432
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,820
Oh, okay.

433
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,820
Yeah.

434
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,820
What are those called?

435
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,820
Like zip ties?

436
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,820
Is that what you mean?

437
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,820
Okay.

438
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,820
I was hoping to be able to use my knot skill.

439
00:22:52,860 --> 00:23:00,860
He's like, well, okay, if you've got to use cheaters knots.

440
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:06,860
Are there any big, uh, calm, cozy comforters like on the couch, like big knit, uh, there's

441
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,860
actually no, there's nothing in here except for surveillance equipment.

442
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,860
So there's not like a bed or any grab a monitor boys and we're just going to chuck it at their

443
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,860
heads.

444
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,860
Everybody grabs a monitor.

445
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,860
How heavy are the monitors?

446
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,860
They're like nineties action movie, little security camera monitors, right?

447
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,900
Yeah.

448
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,900
They're just all over the place.

449
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,900
Yeah.

450
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,900
And like stacked on top of each other and shit.

451
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,900
I just toss one to each of them.

452
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,900
How far away are the sprayers?

453
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,900
Uh, they're approaching right now.

454
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,900
I look at Martin.

455
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,900
Do I go now?

456
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,900
Do it.

457
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,900
I run out the front door.

458
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,900
How far away are they?

459
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,900
Can I see them?

460
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,900
They're, they're literally right in front of you.

461
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,900
There's, I like shut the door behind me so they can't see.

462
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,900
There's something is wrong in there.

463
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,900
Yeah.

464
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,940
In the face.

465
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,940
Like immediately.

466
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,940
As soon as they walk up to you.

467
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,940
What do we see happen as we're holding our monitors?

468
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,940
Yeah.

469
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:03,940
You guys are watching from, from inside and you just see, as soon as he gets sprayed immediately,

470
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,940
his chin goes down to his chest and he just stops moving.

471
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,940
Okay.

472
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,940
They turned him off.

473
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,940
Does the door open in or out?

474
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,940
In.

475
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,940
Well, yeah.

476
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,940
I just want to wait for them to come through the door and then we all check our monitors

477
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,940
at them, at their head.

478
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,940
After, after they've sprayed him, do they do anything with him or do they walk past

479
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,940
him?

480
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,980
They walk right past him.

481
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,980
Yeah.

482
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,980
They just keep moving.

483
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,980
And, uh, everyone roll humid.

484
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,980
Me too or?

485
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,980
No.

486
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,980
Shouldn't listen to.

487
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,980
Pass.

488
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,980
37 on a 60.

489
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,980
Pass.

490
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,980
Tell you what I'm told.

491
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:39,980
So you guys noticed that there is no emotion or anything on these two's faces.

492
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,980
There is just a blank expression.

493
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,980
Look, they're drone people.

494
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,980
If you accidentally clobber them too hard, you know, they go down for good.

495
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,020
You don't have to feel bad about it because clearly they're already dead inside.

496
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,020
So what's the plan from the inside?

497
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,020
Clobber.

498
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:00,020
Just as soon as they open the door, three monitors smashing down on their heads before

499
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,020
they can even fucking like see.

500
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,020
I'll try.

501
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,020
I'll try.

502
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,020
Martin.

503
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,020
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not a fighter.

504
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,020
I'm not a fighter.

505
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,020
I'm not a fighter.

506
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,020
Hey, hey, hey.

507
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,020
Pull yourself to fucking gather, man.

508
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,060
He's going to go kind of toward the back of the room, but be ready to throw.

509
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:16,780
While they were also searching, is there like a gun on any of the desks nearby or anything

510
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,780
like that?

511
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,780
No.

512
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:24,260
But you guys can, if you're all doing the monitor gig, I'd like to do a wield monitors.

513
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:34,580
You can roll athletics or strength and I'll give you guys an advantage of a Thomas.

514
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,460
You would take no advantage, but the other two can have a plus 20.

515
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:45,780
The reason you don't have an advantage is because you're using two.

516
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,660
I absolutely fail even with all the advantage.

517
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,660
Yeah.

518
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,660
Same.

519
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,660
Okay.

520
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:56,700
I rolled an 11 and a 100, but these are, are these contested?

521
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,700
Yeah.

522
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,700
Okay.

523
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,700
So you're fucked either way.

524
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,260
Well, what did you roll?

525
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,640
I rolled a 57 and my skill is 65.

526
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,340
So if we're doing highest without going over, I completely smashed two monitors on both

527
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,340
your fucking heads.

528
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,540
The 11 was a crit success, right?

529
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,820
But it's still for, but that doesn't count a contested rules, does it?

530
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,820
Yes, absolutely.

531
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,820
It trumps everything.

532
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,820
If it's a crit.

533
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,820
You've played this game, right?

534
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,380
Yeah, but this, these rules are weird.

535
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,940
Always have been, always will be, I suppose.

536
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:32,540
Only when you lose though, do they seem to be weird.

537
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,300
You just keep inventing conditions in which I can lose.

538
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,540
I turn back on and attack them.

539
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,540
No, you absolutely smashed one of them.

540
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,180
We'll say the tall woman who is extremely bright.

541
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,420
You were rolling for them.

542
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:51,900
These aren't my rules.

543
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,660
What game is this?

544
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,860
So you describe how one of them goes down.

545
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:01,180
Well, the first one through the door just gets like, I just straight up lob this monitor

546
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,620
right in their face.

547
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:07,660
They don't even see it coming, just like full fucking glass to the face.

548
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,660
They go down.

549
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:13,100
Oh, immediately, literally laying back on the ground with a TV on their head.

550
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,380
But that was my right hand and I'm not as good with my left hand.

551
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,060
And so the person immediately behind them has a little time to like see it and duck

552
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,100
and it's not as like strong or good a throw.

553
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,100
Roger, what did you roll?

554
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,580
A fail, a 97.

555
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,580
Okay.

556
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,340
And then we got a successor fail over here.

557
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,340
Fail 93.

558
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,340
Okay, fantastic.

559
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,060
All right.

560
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,500
So the other one is going to...

561
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,100
Can we just throw our monitors up into the air?

562
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,100
Yikes!

563
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:46,200
Immediately horrified, the little scrawny guy was not expecting this and he, still,

564
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,900
no scream, no holler, no anything.

565
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:54,540
And he just holds up his spray bottle and begins spraying and running toward you guys.

566
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,180
Is it like a squirty spray or like a misty spray?

567
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,460
It's a misty spray.

568
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,460
Luckily.

569
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,460
Yeah.

570
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,300
Can I do something to avoid that now?

571
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,300
Yeah, absolutely.

572
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,620
So this will be another contested roll.

573
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,300
Wait, is he going after the both of us?

574
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,300
He's coming after the room.

575
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,300
He's coming after the room.

576
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,140
You guys are all like right there in the front.

577
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,620
What are we rolling?

578
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,340
Athletics or dexterity.

579
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,780
Okay, let me try rolling again.

580
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,780
Or dodge.

581
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,780
And you roll the...

582
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,780
83.

583
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,780
Not a good fail.

584
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,780
Oh, okay.

585
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,780
Oh my God.

586
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,540
Do I get any bonuses to this one?

587
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,540
No, you do not.

588
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,940
I got a 53 on a 50.

589
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,700
I got a four on a 65.

590
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,580
He actually also failed.

591
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,260
So does he spray himself?

592
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,260
Not a crypto.

593
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,260
He does.

594
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,260
He sprays himself.

595
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,140
However, there seems to be no ill effect.

596
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,140
Okay.

597
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,860
I want to just fucking punch him in the face.

598
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,260
So literally what happened is he's spraying as he's walking and you guys all just like

599
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:54,780
walk into rooms and he's just like walking down the hallway with his arm out flat just

600
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:59,700
spraying it forward and then he's going to turn around and he's going to change the bottle

601
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,020
into his other hand and then spray and just walk down the hallway the other way.

602
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,020
Back out the door.

603
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,020
He's heading back through the hallway.

604
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,180
He's basically just trying to...

605
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,180
Corner us.

606
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,180
Yeah.

607
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,180
Yeah.

608
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,380
Whatever room I've ended up in now, can I see if there's a window that I could break

609
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,380
out?

610
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,380
Oh yeah, for sure.

611
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,380
What do I do?

612
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,380
You see a window.

613
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,380
I want to break it out.

614
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,380
Or open it.

615
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,380
Or open it.

616
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,380
I got to get out of here.

617
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,380
I'm going to slam my head through it.

618
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,380
It's bleeding all over everything.

619
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,380
The glass hurts so bad.

620
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,380
It's all worth it.

621
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,380
Open it.

622
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,380
Can I open it?

623
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,380
Yeah.

624
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,380
You open the window.

625
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,380
Okay.

626
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,380
I'm going to crawl out.

627
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,380
Okay.

628
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,380
Sounds good.

629
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,380
Justin, what are you doing?

630
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,660
Can I see if there's something I can use to bludgeon like something with some reach like

631
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:45,900
a bat or another monitor or something.

632
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,900
Yeah.

633
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,660
There's actually a...

634
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,660
Help me out here guys.

635
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,660
A tripod.

636
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,660
What would...

637
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,820
A tripod would be pretty good.

638
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,260
What could he use?

639
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,780
No, something far more.

640
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,780
There's like a...

641
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,780
Like an empty bed frame?

642
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,780
No, there's a...

643
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,780
A keyboard.

644
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,780
Fuck.

645
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,820
Tennis racket.

646
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,700
We're giving you golden things that can be in a cabin.

647
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,640
Loose wood panel on the floor.

648
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,640
There's a snowshoe.

649
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,140
There's a big hairy mean dog.

650
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,140
An old fishing pole.

651
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,780
An old fisher man.

652
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,780
A samurai sword.

653
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:20,780
I got a collection of samurai swords and bazookas in here.

654
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,120
Bazookas and grenades and land mines.

655
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,480
It's one of those things on the wall with the pinned insects on it.

656
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,280
There's a bigger spray bottle.

657
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:35,120
There's a spray bottle that says anti-spray bottles guy.

658
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,360
There's a taxidermied frog holding a banjo.

659
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,360
Ooh, that one.

660
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,360
That one, yeah.

661
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,360
That one.

662
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,360
That one.

663
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,360
There's a taxidermied frog holding a banjo.

664
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,520
I pick it up for violence.

665
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,320
Don't destroy that art.

666
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:53,080
God damn, now I want a taxidermied frog holding a banjo.

667
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,480
That's some quality folk art.

668
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,560
I want to hide around the corner if there's a nook of some kind where I can get a jump

669
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,560
on him.

670
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
Yeah, absolutely.

671
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,560
You got it.

672
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,560
Okay.

673
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,560
I'm just going to wait.

674
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,560
Does the door open in or out of this room?

675
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,560
There's no door.

676
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,560
Oh.

677
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:15,440
Well, there goes my plan to wang him on the head with a door.

678
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,800
What kind of taxidermy is in my room?

679
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,240
Ooh, a raccoon with a straw hat.

680
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,240
Yes.

681
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
And a reed.

682
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
Yeah, absolutely.

683
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,400
A long reed.

684
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,280
The reed is actually longer than the raccoon is tall.

685
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,160
I pluck the reed and I start chewing on it.

686
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:37,300
And I, yeah, it tastes like old glue.

687
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:42,400
And I hold this thing like a baseball bat and I'm also behind my corner just waiting

688
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
for him to come in.

689
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,320
When you say hold it like a baseball bat, are you holding it by the head and its feet

690
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,320
are standing up?

691
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,320
Or are you holding it by-

692
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,340
I'm holding it by the feet and its head is the club end.

693
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,840
And I imagine its arms are doing kind of cute things.

694
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,020
So those are kind of like little spikes coming out from it.

695
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:01,660
Yeah, that's like a D12 weapon at least.

696
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,780
At least.

697
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:07,660
He won't see either one of these attacks coming, so you guys can both roll with a plus 20 and

698
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,660
it won't be opposed.

699
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,660
Wang him.

700
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,660
Who goes first?

701
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,420
Both of you at the same time.

702
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,260
Is this athletics or?

703
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,260
You can roll-

704
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,260
Oh, this would be not-

705
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,260
This would be melee combat.

706
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,420
Oh, no.

707
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,420
Are you sure?

708
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,820
Oh, hell yeah.

709
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,820
Plus 20?

710
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,820
Yeah.

711
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,820
Okay, I have a 50.

712
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,180
I rolled a 52, but I have a plus 20, so limo.

713
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,340
Yeah, I failed big time.

714
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,340
97.

715
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,940
Okay, so thankfully the frog stays intact.

716
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,440
Oh, thank God.

717
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,940
That's all I cared for.

718
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,340
You swing right over this.

719
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:44,420
He's a very short fella and you were expecting the tall broad woman, right?

720
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,900
And so you swing right over his head, but thankfully-

721
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:54,020
Yeah, I see his shadow come through the doorway and I just wind up and fucking Sammy Sosa

722
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:58,940
this motherfucker right in his face with the raccoon teeth pointed out.

723
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:04,500
If I could catch those on an eyeball or something, I'm really trying to do maximum damage.

724
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:12,700
Yeah, you catch the teeth on an eyeball and his eye, as he hits the ground completely

725
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:21,740
unconscious, you see that there is the string essentially holding the eyeball in place,

726
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:28,460
is actually stretched fully out and you still are holding on to the other end and if you

727
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,460
kind of like-

728
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,620
Yeah, I try to get my raccoon loose.

729
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:37,580
Yeah, and his head is just like pop, pop, pop, like hitting against the ground.

730
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:42,940
When I finally give it the pull that rips the eye out with the raccoon and his head

731
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:50,620
flunks down to the ground, I bow and I say, Namaste and I walk out.

732
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:58,300
I also collect his spray bottle and I think I want to change into his clothes and I come

733
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:02,340
out into the room to do all that, so Justin just sees me in the process of becoming fully

734
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,340
nude.

735
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,780
There's no time to waste.

736
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,780
Oh, okay.

737
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,940
Can I go find the woman's clothes and change into them?

738
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,940
Yeah.

739
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,500
Okay, so I want to investigate this bottle.

740
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:17,620
It is just a spray bottle, there's absolutely nothing on it and you're looking at it and

741
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:23,400
you're standing in the meeting room for where you had orientation and you're looking over

742
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,540
the spray bottle that you have in your hand.

743
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,540
Dope.

744
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:31,660
Bradley Cooper is looking down at the spray bottle and when you do, you-

745
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,500
I think you can call me my real name now.

746
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,500
Oh, Martin Cupertino.

747
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,500
Who?

748
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,500
Oh.

749
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,500
Oh.

750
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,500
A billionaire?

751
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,620
What a billionaire.

752
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,980
Looking down at this spray bottle and as you're holding it-

753
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,820
I was really proud of that word and then I Googled it and it's definitely a thing.

754
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,820
Oh, yeah.

755
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,820
It makes sense.

756
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,820
Cupertino?

757
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,820
Yeah.

758
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,820
Garden?

759
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,820
Billionaire.

760
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,820
Oh.

761
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,820
Oh.

762
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:01,980
Cupertino was a very intentional choice.

763
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:07,620
I just like came up with that and it was wild.

764
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,620
That's what I thought you were saying.

765
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,620
I was like, yeah, man.

766
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,620
No, no, no.

767
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,620
Billionaire.

768
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,460
Uh, well, you know what they say.

769
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,460
There was a...

770
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,460
Uh, no.

771
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,460
Oh, well.

772
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,460
Who?

773
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,740
Um, stop it.

774
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:26,540
So when you look down at this bottle, you see that there is a piece of tape on it and

775
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:36,020
written on the piece of tape is the word Sanfera Blom, S-A-N-F-E-R-R-A space B-L-O-M.

776
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,620
Sanfera Blom.

777
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,700
Yes.

778
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:43,340
And as you're holding it, real quick, Roger Fairfield, roll an intelligence check for

779
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,860
me.

780
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,380
I pass a 43 on a 75.

781
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:56,060
You would recognize that name from the book that you're reading of the flora in the area.

782
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,580
Nice.

783
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,580
I remember it as a plant.

784
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,580
Yes.

785
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:05,420
And Martin Cupertino, you smell this bottle like it is pungent and you can smell.

786
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,820
It's the exact same smell of the flowers that are all over this island.

787
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,820
Cool.

788
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,500
Can I remember details about what I read about it?

789
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,720
Guys, guys, guys, everybody shut up.

790
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,720
Shut up.

791
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,720
Shut up.

792
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,900
Remember all the flowers blooming in the city.

793
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,900
Oh, I don't.

794
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,140
That's a different character.

795
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,140
I remember though.

796
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,140
Yeah.

797
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,140
Nice.

798
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,140
Interesting.

799
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:39,300
You get five luck points for not this character, but maybe in the future when we're using

800
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,300
luck.

801
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,300
Right.

802
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,300
Write it down.

803
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,300
I'm just going to...

804
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,300
Yeah.

805
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,300
Zach owes me a debit of five luck.

806
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,900
That's exactly right.

807
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:53,260
So Bradley Cooper, Charles Digby, Walter and Alan Grimes and Angela and Roger Fairfield,

808
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:59,140
you are all in this meeting room with the walls that round off at all the corners.

809
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:07,020
And there is these two people, this tall broad woman and this short scrawny man are both

810
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:12,320
on the ground and you're holding one of the bottles and the other bottle is across the

811
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,060
floor and it's been opened and it is just like in the corner.

812
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,340
It's spilling out of the room.

813
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:24,500
I want to spray the guy next to me in the face and fucking book it out of the room.

814
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,500
Okay.

815
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,500
What's everybody else doing?

816
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,700
Is Angela being there a thing?

817
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,700
Yeah.

818
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,700
We'll see.

819
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,420
I pass.

820
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,420
No.

821
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,420
It's not a thing.

822
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,420
Okay.

823
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,420
Hey, Angela.

824
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,180
Hey, Raj.

825
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,180
This is crazy.

826
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,580
We need to get the fuck out of this room.

827
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,260
I feel like I was just coming to see you.

828
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,260
That's weird.

829
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,260
Yeah.

830
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,260
I think we got to get out of here.

831
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,260
Right?

832
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,100
You're looking at me, but Martin Cupertino has fled.

833
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,100
Yes.

834
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,100
Real quick.

835
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,780
What are the Grimes doing and what is Charles Digby doing?

836
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,220
I look at Alan.

837
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,220
What is he doing?

838
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:05,180
He's shaking his head back and forth and his jowls are just flopping about, little bits

839
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:11,740
of spittle are going everywhere as he's just very confused about what's going on.

840
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,020
I'm going to just wait there for a second.

841
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,140
You're going to what?

842
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,140
Just wait there for a second.

843
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,140
Okay.

844
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,140
Charles Digby.

845
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,300
I think I'm going to book it with Martin.

846
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:26,060
As soon as you guys get to the door, the door opens and Jack Russell is standing there,

847
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:31,820
short stout man, and he's like, we need to get the fuck out of here immediately.

848
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,220
Are you kidding me?

849
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,220
What?

850
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,220
I think you got him.

851
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,220
You got him.

852
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:41,020
I'm glad he said that because I was about to spray him in the face.

853
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,020
What happened when-

854
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:46,580
You hold the bottle up and I'm like, if you're with, that's actually hilarious.

855
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,780
If you're with them, I'm going to spray your ass down right now.

856
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:53,820
His hands go straight up in the air and he's like, no, Mike, there's no way that I'm with

857
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,820
him.

858
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,820
I'm trying to-

859
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,820
I believe you.

860
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,820
I found your go hole.

861
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,820
You didn't have a bag, really.

862
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:10,420
You didn't have a go bag, but you had a hole full of supplies underneath my floorboards.

863
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,980
I put my hand in the hole.

864
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,700
Do you have the syringe?

865
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:17,020
No, I forgot about that the first time.

866
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,020
Check your pockets.

867
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,020
Check your pockets.

868
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,020
See what you brought with you.

869
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,020
I check my pockets.

870
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,020
You have the syringe.

871
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,020
It pokes you and you die.

872
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,020
Oh, yep, there it is.

873
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,020
Ow!

874
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,020
I do.

875
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,020
Did that peak horribly?

876
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,020
Probably.

877
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,020
Say ow again.

878
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,020
I check my pockets.

879
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,020
Ow!

880
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,020
Yeah, I have it.

881
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:40,380
No, I probably didn't peak the first time.

882
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,980
What happened when he sprayed the guy?

883
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,980
Literally nothing.

884
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:49,680
Those people are blank, and when they fell, they just kind of stayed down.

885
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,820
But when you look over at them now, they're slowly getting back up with just a look of

886
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,220
nothing on their faces.

887
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,980
Are they getting up like people get up, or are they getting up in-

888
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,020
They're getting up like people get up.

889
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,180
I don't recognize these people at all, do I?

890
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:09,100
You would just recognize them from this weird out of place memory that you have of being

891
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,960
in cottage number 11.

892
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,320
These aren't the same attendants who we've seen before?

893
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:20,700
They were the same attendants that you saw in cottage 11 who sprayed Walter Grimes.

894
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,660
Are they getting up kind of like on their hands and knees?

895
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:27,680
I'll describe how they get up just to really put it down there.

896
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,740
So they're both on the ground, and they both put their palms on the ground-

897
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,740
In a weird way?

898
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,740
Like people do?

899
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,820
And then slowly move their feet up toward their palms.

900
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,540
Oh, okay.

901
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,380
So just like a normal person would.

902
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,380
Exactly.

903
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:45,260
And then once their feet and palms are both like next to each other, then they slowly

904
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:50,620
remove their palms and release towards the sky while exhaling.

905
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,820
Listener Zach is on the floor doing all this.

906
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,820
Doing yoga in front of us.

907
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,820
And it looks exactly like how a human looks.

908
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,060
I got a lot of mic for this one.

909
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:04,100
So as they're doing that, I want to go over to the guy, and while he's like still hands

910
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:11,420
on the ground, I want to get behind him and put my hand under his jaw and try to rip.

911
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,580
Good call.

912
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,740
As if maybe it's a removable face.

913
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

914
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,740
No, I get it.

915
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,740
Exactly.

916
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,900
We all got where you're going with that.

917
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,620
Okay, roll unarmed combat.

918
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,620
Unfaced combat.

919
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,620
Fail.

920
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:33,020
90 on a 49.

921
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:39,980
Yeah, as you put your hand underneath his jaw, he grabs onto your hand and begins to

922
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,740
slowly move it away from his face.

923
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,900
And he turns around to face you.

924
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:49,020
And he holds up his hand like he has a spray bottle in it, but he doesn't.

925
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:53,020
And he's trying to like moving his fingers like he's spraying you in the face.

926
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,020
Okay, I'm going to run away.

927
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:58,860
Hey, real quick, how do you have a 49?

928
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,860
I have a 55 now.

929
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,700
Whoa.

930
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,700
I don't...

931
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,700
Okay.

932
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:10,060
Zach gave you some fun mechanics.

933
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,660
Luke asks, and I like to say yes.

934
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,900
All right, so...

935
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:19,060
Can I get better at beating people up every time I don't beat someone up?

936
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,060
Yeah, sure.

937
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,060
Why not?

938
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,060
Zach, I would like that too.

939
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,900
This story won't go that long, probably.

940
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,980
All right, so what does everyone know?

941
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,300
I mean, these two aren't going to be an issue, right?

942
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:37,820
And so, and then he looks up and his eyes cross Angela's and his eyes get really big

943
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,820
and he's like...

944
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,420
I'm so sorry.

945
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:49,780
I just noticed the bottle of hand sanitizer that we have in front of us as a very sassy

946
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,200
like font.

947
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,300
And it says, what did you touch?

948
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:58,300
Oh my God.

949
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,700
What did you touch?

950
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,700
What did you touch?

951
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:07,700
Which is exactly what Jack Russell says to Angela Fairfield.

952
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,700
What did you touch, honey?

953
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,700
What did you touch?

954
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,700
What did you touch?

955
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:17,140
Honey, what did you touch?

956
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:21,860
And she begins backing away slowly from everyone.

957
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,540
Honey, you all right, Angie?

958
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,060
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

959
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,380
I'm confused though.

960
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:30,620
Is everyone cool here?

961
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:31,620
What has happened?

962
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,620
Are you guys good?

963
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,620
Yeah, we're cool.

964
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,620
Are you cool?

965
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,620
Do you have any weed?

966
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,620
I feel like we never got to the bottom of that.

967
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,220
Oh, we got to the bottom of it.

968
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,580
Do you have anything on your hand?

969
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,580
I brought weed.

970
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,580
Yeah, it's no big deal.

971
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,580
Will you pass me a J?

972
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,580
Is this the time?

973
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:48,340
Yeah, canonically, I just kind of want to get this done.

974
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,340
Okay.

975
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:52,740
And she just reaches into her little clutch and throws you a joint.

976
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:56,860
Okay, I'm going to add a syringe and a joint to my inventory.

977
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:58,860
The classics.

978
00:43:58,860 --> 00:43:59,860
Yep.

979
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,860
Woof.

980
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:08,340
Can I roll human to see if something's fucky with her?

981
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,340
Yes.

982
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,340
Can I do that too?

983
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,340
Yes.

984
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,140
Do we all even see her?

985
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,140
Yes.

986
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,140
Okay.

987
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,140
I passed my human troll.

988
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,140
I failed.

989
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:22,540
Charles Digby, you know that she is extremely nervous and confused.

990
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,540
Okay.

991
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,540
Honey, you seem nervous and confused.

992
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,740
Why don't you come with us?

993
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,740
Yeah.

994
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,380
Yeah, no, I'll come with you guys.

995
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,460
Do you guys remember if she was with us the last time?

996
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,820
What are you talking about?

997
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,820
Of course.

998
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:38,820
In the cabin?

999
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,100
She wasn't with us in the cabin.

1000
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,100
Out of character.

1001
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,100
Yeah, she was not.

1002
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,100
Out of character.

1003
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,100
No, I was asking in character.

1004
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,100
Yeah, in character.

1005
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,100
What the fuck is going on?

1006
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,100
What are you guys talking about when you're in the cab?

1007
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,580
We've just been waiting for James.

1008
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,580
Waiting for James.

1009
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,580
Is that all you think you've done here?

1010
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:58,100
Well, I do remember James came in, and then I thought that you left with him, and then

1011
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,820
I was going to come and get you, and then you...

1012
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:03,660
No, we were all just waiting for him to come in because we're having another meeting.

1013
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,780
I think we need to run now and talk about this later.

1014
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,380
Yeah, we're going to run.

1015
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,060
You can come with us if you want.

1016
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,180
We're going with Jack Russell.

1017
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,180
Roger, come with us.

1018
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,180
Yeah, yeah.

1019
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:16,100
Wait, but you said we were waiting for James to come in.

1020
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,200
Yeah, we were waiting for James.

1021
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,260
So he hasn't come in yet.

1022
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,020
That means that maybe he's coming.

1023
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,980
Why don't you stay here and find out?

1024
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:23,980
Roger, come.

1025
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,140
We need to go now.

1026
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,140
And I grab him.

1027
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:30,100
I pat him on the shoulder, like, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's

1028
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,100
go.

1029
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,100
Honey, come on.

1030
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,100
We should follow them.

1031
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,020
Yeah, okay, but what are we doing?

1032
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,700
Why are we leaving?

1033
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,700
There's something wrong.

1034
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,700
There's something wrong.

1035
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,860
They're spray bottles, and they're...

1036
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:48,460
Zuhur Ilknei, Zuhur Ilknei, Zuhur Ilknei, Bradley Cooper, Charles Jacobi, Walter and

1037
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:54,540
Alan Grimes, and Roger Fairfield, you are all sitting in a half circle facing a single

1038
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:58,740
empty chair in the meeting room where you had orientation.

1039
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,900
Everyone roll Constitution.

1040
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,940
Except for Bradley, who crit.

1041
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,780
Oh, well, he just passed again.

1042
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,420
59 on a 60.

1043
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,420
Nice.

1044
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:09,420
Fail.

1045
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,820
I pass a 14 on a 70.

1046
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:15,620
Okay, everyone take your headphones off except for Justin.

1047
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:16,620
Yay.

1048
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,580
Don't hurt me too bad, Zai.

1049
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:26,260
Okay, Justin, I need you to play on this one like you don't remember like anything from

1050
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:30,980
all of these confusing plot points like you just got here and everything's normal.

1051
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:31,980
Cool.

1052
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:32,980
You ready for that?

1053
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:33,980
So like I just first arrived?

1054
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,980
Yeah, like you're fresh and ready to go.

1055
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:36,980
Right, okay.

1056
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,340
Okay, everybody back.

1057
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,620
It's weird.

1058
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,740
It's weird how well that works.

1059
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:48,300
The listener can't see us, but usually we go out of the room when it's short, Zach just

1060
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,860
has us take our headphones off and then we just like press our ears.

1061
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:52,860
Ear flap?

1062
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:53,860
What do you call that part?

1063
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:54,860
Yeah, right.

1064
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:55,860
It has a name.

1065
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:56,860
Tragus.

1066
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:57,860
I'm sorry, whoa, what is it?

1067
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:58,860
Tragus.

1068
00:46:58,860 --> 00:46:59,860
A tragus.

1069
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:00,860
Ear anatomy.

1070
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:05,980
If you just slam your tragus on both sides, you get a roar in your ear.

1071
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,180
Oh, okay.

1072
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,180
Can you guys?

1073
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,980
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

1074
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:10,980
Ear rumble?

1075
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:11,980
Oh, the ear rumble, yeah.

1076
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,060
I didn't know everybody couldn't do that.

1077
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,700
I think most people can because- It's called the tragus.

1078
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,700
Yep, that's what I said.

1079
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,420
You're acting like Luke.

1080
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,660
Good job, Luke.

1081
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:24,660
We both are right all the time.

1082
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:25,660
Thanks.

1083
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,660
I've got both my mind pierced, so that's how I know.

1084
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:28,660
Oh.

1085
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:31,020
You can't tell because I have headphones on.

1086
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,620
Did you actually in the past get your tragus?

1087
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,260
No, I've never had anything pierced.

1088
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:35,260
Anything?

1089
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:39,340
My PA, I've got a Prince Albert, but that's it.

1090
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:41,540
You would look really good with some piercings.

1091
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,100
I thought you were going to say it with a Prince Albert.

1092
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,100
You would look so hot.

1093
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:50,500
Obviously, everybody would look great with a Prince Albert.

1094
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:55,180
I just think Luke could really rock some funky tragus piercings.

1095
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,580
I don't think if I got anything pierced, it wouldn't-

1096
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,580
It would be your dingus.

1097
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,580
I don't know what I would get.

1098
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,580
Your dingus.

1099
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,580
We'll think about it later.

1100
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,020
I'll let you know at the end of the episode.

1101
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,580
So you guys are sitting in this room.

1102
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:07,620
It's just you guys.

1103
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,860
The spray bottles aren't in here, the two people aren't in here.

1104
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,100
Angela's not in here.

1105
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,940
How's our memory working right now?

1106
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:16,700
Do we remember spray bottle guys in the room?

1107
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,900
You do, but they're not here.

1108
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:18,940
This place sucks.

1109
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:20,900
Why did you guys come here if it sucks?

1110
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,140
Aren't we all coming here to get better?

1111
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,820
Angela wanted us to get better, yeah.

1112
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:25,820
That's good.

1113
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,820
Yeah, I-

1114
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,820
What?

1115
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:28,820
Wait a minute.

1116
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:29,820
What?

1117
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:30,820
What are you so-

1118
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,820
What?

1119
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:32,820
Why are you so protective of this place and its agenda?

1120
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:33,820
What agenda are you guys talking about?

1121
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:34,820
I'm not talking about an agenda.

1122
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,420
I thought we were just here for therapy.

1123
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:38,140
You've seen what's happened here.

1124
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,140
Don't you remember?

1125
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,820
Charles Digby's getting scared.

1126
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:41,820
What's going on?

1127
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:42,820
Do you not remember?

1128
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:43,820
We were all just here.

1129
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:44,820
But it was different.

1130
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:45,820
Right?

1131
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:46,940
Am I fucking losing my mind here?

1132
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:47,940
I remember that.

1133
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:48,940
Yeah.

1134
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:49,940
I remember.

1135
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:50,940
No, this is my- I just got here.

1136
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,940
And this is like our orientation, isn't it?

1137
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:53,940
Or-

1138
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:54,940
Oh, damn it, Digby.

1139
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:55,940
Did they spray you?

1140
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:56,940
Who are you?

1141
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:57,940
I'm Martin Cupertino.

1142
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:59,580
I'm a Silicon Valley billionaire.

1143
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,260
Oh, I read about you.

1144
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:02,260
Yeah.

1145
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:04,860
Definitely not taking pictures of people like you before.

1146
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:05,860
I want to go over to-

1147
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,500
I am a paparazzo.

1148
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,580
And put my hand on his jaw and rip.

1149
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:11,580
You?

1150
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:12,580
On Charles.

1151
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,580
See if he's-

1152
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:14,580
Okay.

1153
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:15,580
Well, this young kid-

1154
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,580
I contest.

1155
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,340
And a Metallica shirt walks up to you.

1156
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,340
Hey, what are you doing?

1157
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:20,340
Do we need to do it?

1158
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,340
Yeah.

1159
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,340
I mean, if he's going for it.

1160
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,340
Unarmed combat.

1161
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,340
38 on a 55.

1162
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,340
Oh, shit.

1163
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:26,340
Uh-oh.

1164
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:27,340
Fuck.

1165
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,340
41 on a 60.

1166
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,340
Oh, wait.

1167
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,340
No, let me do it.

1168
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,340
I thought it was below.

1169
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,340
You rip his face off.

1170
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,340
Yeah.

1171
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,340
I kill him.

1172
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,340
I kill the boy.

1173
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:47,500
All right, Luke, describe the beginning of what you do, and then we'll let Justin describe

1174
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,180
how he combats that.

1175
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:53,780
Like, after he is saying all that, I just kind of look at him weird, and I just stand

1176
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:59,500
straight up, walk right over to him, and with just my pointer finger and thumb right behind

1177
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,260
his cheek, just try to-

1178
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,260
Yeah.

1179
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,580
So at this point in time, what's Charles Digby doing?

1180
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:08,360
I just grab the hand and pull the finger back.

1181
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,660
Not break it, but pull it back to be like, what are you doing?

1182
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:12,660
Yes.

1183
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,180
Walter, get away from this man.

1184
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:17,080
I don't think we can trust him.

1185
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,300
Why can't you guys trust me?

1186
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,460
Charles, what's going ... You don't remember anything?

1187
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,860
I've never met you guys until today.

1188
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:28,420
Have we already done the true truths and a lie in this room?

1189
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:29,420
Yes.

1190
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,420
Well, yeah.

1191
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:33,540
Of course we have, but we've also done a lot of other ... Do you remember when there

1192
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,660
were spray bottles?

1193
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:35,660
The spray bottle thing?

1194
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,340
No, I don't know what you guys are talking about.

1195
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:41,980
I'm a little ... Maybe I need to go talk to James.

1196
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,820
No, no, no, no, no.

1197
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:46,180
I kind of start getting up and walking towards the door.

1198
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,180
Father, I'm confused.

1199
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,180
Sorry.

1200
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,180
We all just made eye contact.

1201
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,180
I say, sorry.

1202
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:54,180
I'm trying to tackle you now.

1203
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:55,180
Awesome.

1204
00:50:55,180 --> 00:51:03,500
27, not great for a contested unarmed combat role.

1205
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,500
He's trying to tackle you.

1206
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,860
I don't think I'd notice because I'm walking ... I'm assuming you're tackling me from behind

1207
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:08,860
or something.

1208
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:09,860
Yeah.

1209
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:10,860
So it just happens.

1210
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:11,860
Yeah.

1211
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,860
Didn't say how you tackle me.

1212
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:13,860
Yeah.

1213
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:15,820
What's his body feel like on your body?

1214
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:16,980
What's your body look like?

1215
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:17,980
Average.

1216
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:21,860
It feels like an average.

1217
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:23,660
Average sort of tackle.

1218
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,180
It doesn't feel like the NFL or anything.

1219
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,180
That's good.

1220
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,920
It's small compared to that because he's average.

1221
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,720
As this is happening, I look at Roger.

1222
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,240
What was your wife saying?

1223
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,240
Oh yeah.

1224
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,760
She was saying ... Can I remember what she was saying?

1225
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,760
Role intelligence.

1226
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,760
Oh fuck, I fail.

1227
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,880
A 78 on a 75.

1228
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,600
No, you can't quite remember.

1229
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:51,200
Fuck, neither can Joe.

1230
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,200
It was something weird.

1231
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,440
It was weird.

1232
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,440
It was like a chanting kind of thing.

1233
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,320
Have you ever heard that before?

1234
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,440
No, never.

1235
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,440
Is that the correct answer?

1236
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:00,960
Have I never heard her do that before?

1237
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,960
I have no idea.

1238
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,960
I don't know you.

1239
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,960
Walter, tell me.

1240
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,760
Have I heard it before?

1241
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,760
You've definitely heard it.

1242
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,760
Do you remember Tuesday?

1243
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,320
No, you have never heard that before from Angela.

1244
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,480
There has to be something in this room that gets us somewhere else.

1245
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,520
It was the spray bottle once and then when she chanted that, we came here.

1246
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,520
Oh God, no.

1247
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,360
It was something strange and I don't ... But now she's not even here and everything-

1248
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,360
Yeah.

1249
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:30,160
Hey, buddy, you know your wife's in on this, right?

1250
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,160
And she's probably not your wife.

1251
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,480
Is she not here with us right now?

1252
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,480
No.

1253
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,480
Is Martin on top of me while this is happening?

1254
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,480
That keeps happening.

1255
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,480
Yeah, I'm on top.

1256
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,480
I turn around.

1257
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:41,680
Am I like struggling or like ... You didn't say you were, so I just thought

1258
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,680
you were lying flat.

1259
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,680
He's just admitted.

1260
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,680
I'm sorry.

1261
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,760
I was just like, I give up.

1262
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,760
You got comfy.

1263
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,760
I'm sad.

1264
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,760
You're like actually the weight of another human being for the first time in a while.

1265
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,760
Yeah, it's really nice on my back.

1266
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,760
Oh, yeah.

1267
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,560
I like getting sat on.

1268
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,280
That's why I'm here.

1269
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,160
Can I do a search to see if there's anything out of place in this room?

1270
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,160
You can.

1271
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,000
10 on a 43.

1272
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,400
Nothing is out of place in this room except for maybe that Angela Fairfield isn't here.

1273
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,560
Is anything two in place?

1274
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,800
I don't know what that means.

1275
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,880
You actually looked at me like you were going to let me roll?

1276
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:16,880
Yeah.

1277
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:17,880
So maybe that's exactly what it is.

1278
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:18,880
You can roll.

1279
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,880
64.

1280
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:20,880
No.

1281
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,480
Oh, then you don't learn the cool thing.

1282
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:31,280
Can I struggle to get up or am I like, did you tackle me from behind or are you just

1283
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,280
like-

1284
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,280
Yeah, I've got you pinned, I think.

1285
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,280
I've got you.

1286
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,280
Yeah.

1287
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,280
Can I try and, is there like a struggle mechanic?

1288
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,280
Yeah.

1289
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,280
I mean, it's unarmed combat.

1290
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,280
Oh, okay.

1291
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,280
Yeah.

1292
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,280
Do I have advantage because I've pinned him?

1293
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,280
You do.

1294
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,280
You have a plus 20.

1295
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,280
Fuck.

1296
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,400
Oh, I didn't pass.

1297
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,400
I did pass.

1298
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,400
I'm like-

1299
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,400
How do you keep him down?

1300
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,760
46 on a modified 90.

1301
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,080
Yeah.

1302
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,480
No, like with no apparent effort.

1303
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,480
Yeah.

1304
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,480
I've just got him pinned.

1305
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,520
Comfortably in a pressure lock.

1306
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,920
And I'm still just turned around like, you know your wife's not real, right?

1307
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,360
Half the time she's not even here.

1308
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:12,820
I'm doing the thing where the only thing that's moving is my neck and I'm like, but no part

1309
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:15,200
of my muscles are moving.

1310
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:20,280
One of my arms is pinning you down, but another one is gently rubbing your back, just trying

1311
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:23,080
to calm you down like a pig or something.

1312
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,840
Now I'm more confused.

1313
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,840
I'm like, what?

1314
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,840
I don't-

1315
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,040
I'm just trying to temple grand in you.

1316
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,840
I'll just squeeze you.

1317
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,840
Calm me down.

1318
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,080
While this is happening, I'm just going around touching everything in the room.

1319
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,080
Okay.

1320
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,080
I feel you just like touch my chin.

1321
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,080
I'm like, what the fuck?

1322
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:44,560
Roger, when Martin is on top of Charles Digby and he's looking at you saying that your wife

1323
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,200
isn't real, how are you responding?

1324
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,400
Of course she's real.

1325
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,400
She's my wife.

1326
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,400
I don't understand.

1327
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,160
I don't understand how she wouldn't be-

1328
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,080
I feel like we've seen you go through this before.

1329
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:57,400
The door opens and Angela is standing there.

1330
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,400
See there.

1331
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,400
Hey guys.

1332
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,600
Hey Angela, are you really his wife?

1333
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,880
Her eyes get really big.

1334
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:03,880
Yeah.

1335
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,880
Why?

1336
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,360
I'd like to humant that.

1337
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,360
Roll humant.

1338
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,360
Oh shit.

1339
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,360
Uh, fail.

1340
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,360
Yeah.

1341
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,360
85 on a 60.

1342
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,680
I don't understand the line of questioning, honey.

1343
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,680
I don't either, Angie.

1344
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,680
Where's this going, Martin?

1345
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,680
Come on, man.

1346
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,680
She's never here.

1347
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,160
I mean, sometimes she is, but like when shit goes down.

1348
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,520
Why are you on top of-

1349
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,520
Martin?

1350
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,880
I thought you were Brad Lee Cooper.

1351
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:31,880
Brad Lee Cooper.

1352
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:32,880
That's right.

1353
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,480
Angela, help.

1354
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,600
Go get James and get me out of here.

1355
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,600
What's happening right now?

1356
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,200
I didn't come here to be treated like this.

1357
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,720
This is supposed to be a nice calm-

1358
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:44,720
Oh, that's right.

1359
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,000
That's why I'm on you because you wanted to get James.

1360
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Yeah, actually-

1361
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Angela.

1362
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:53,800
She takes one step back and shuts the door and she's on the other side of it.

1363
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:54,800
Angie?

1364
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Yeah.

1365
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Yeah.

1366
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:54,040
I'm tired of coming.

1367
00:56:54,040 --> 00:57:00,040
I think that you could fall.

1368
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:08,040
I knew I'd make you believe.

1369
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:12,040
Cooler than you could lose me.

1370
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,040
Yeah.

1371
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:54,040
Now I think you could swallow me.

1372
00:57:54,040 --> 00:58:01,040
Corner room in at least right.

1373
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:05,040
Corner in at least right.

1374
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,040
Yeah.

1375
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,040
Yeah.

1376
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,040
Yeah.

1377
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,040
Yeah.

1378
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,040
Yeah.

1379
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,040
