0	6580	Skip a bop, a skibbity bop, a wee dee dee dee dee dee, a skip skibbity skip skip, it's
6580	15760	Scatman Wolf, y'all, hittin' you from bleeba deeba 694.2 PTBP, my jazzy babies, and I am
15760	21800	hittin' you live from the past and the present, and maybe even the future.
21800	26060	Time is weird, time is like jazz.
26060	30260	It's all made up, and no one fuckin' understands it.
30260	35140	Speaking of things I don't understand and I'm forced to do, this week's Howlin'
35140	40360	with Wolf is from Brittany Roxanne, who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending
40360	41360	pod.
41360	48020	Seriously, what a pleasant thing to do, they write, I have an urgent message for Hurt Ork.
48020	54860	Your message is simple, infiltrate the enemy, gather intel, and report back what you find.
54860	61180	If your cover's blown, do not, under any circumstances, contact us.
61180	63060	Good luck, Agent.
63060	70540	Uh, this seems like a weird avenue to deliver super secret urgent messages to people.
70540	78140	I hope Hurt Ork accomplishes whatever the mission was, unless that mission is to infiltrate
78140	83060	my home and gather intel on little ol' me?
83260	88940	Hey, producer, beef up the security around here, you salty salt dog.
88940	93180	If you see some Ork who was hurt, you know what to do.
93180	95740	Hey, do you like this show?
95740	97580	Do you wanna help this show?
97580	99580	Do you even think we deserve it?
99580	106820	Patreon.com slash PretendingPod, at PretendingPod on Twitter and Instagram, Reddit.com slash
106820	112900	all slash PretendingToBePeople, write a review on Apple Podcasts, why don't ya?
112940	119300	Let the congregation say amen, an elf, a dwarf, and a wizard.
119300	125100	Blessed are the measures that light the fuse, let's erupt the oppressors and we'll write
125100	126980	the news.
126980	133180	The PCs all woke up feeling strange and finding they'd been pricked in their veins right in
133180	135060	the pit of their elbows.
135060	139180	Hmm, elbows, the knees of the arms.
139180	146060	Zack fucked up Justin's reaction to failing his constitution check, and I'll bet it never
146060	147820	comes up again.
147820	152420	Seriously, he just thought Justin succeeded that check for some reason.
152420	155660	Hmm, he must've been all nervous and shit.
155660	157940	What a dumb motherfucker.
157940	163340	Anyway, Martin twisted his ankle in the go bag hiding place he had previously covered
163340	166540	up and he found the go bag was missing.
166580	171820	He also cannot remember arriving here at calm, comfy campground.
171820	178380	Walter and Alan discussed who to trust, deciding they could only trust each other.
178380	185140	However, Walter no longer trusts Alan due to his memory of Alan trying to sell him.
185140	187700	Charles Digby had a knock at the door.
187700	193580	The bellboy Leon was looking for Jack Russell and Jack Russell was hiding under the floor.
193620	198580	They talked about an inoculation and Digby promised he wouldn't snitch.
198580	203740	Roger Fairfield realized he'd been drugged and found a hair tie near the open window
203740	207340	that was locked and closed when he had gone to sleep.
207340	212660	The hair seemed to match a young girl named Maggie who ran from James to Angela while
212660	214220	calling her Ann.
214220	217220	Hmm, nothing suspicious there.
217260	223020	In the meeting room, Angela was called out into the hallway by James.
223020	224820	Inside tensions rose.
224820	230300	Walter tried to turn himself off after Martin violated his personal space.
230300	235060	Walter came back with a throat punch that gave Thomas permission to do whatever he's
235060	236060	doing.
236060	240100	This week I got exactly what your soul desires.
240100	247540	A brand new song, a premiere, a future classic, a modern myth, a song that makes you feel
247540	250220	the right kind of wrong.
250220	256380	It's Dream Girl, my babies, with Pretty Sexual.
270100	285940	This is real, I dream I knew I'd make you be foolish
285940	292060	Thomas Martin Cupertino just got fucking rocked in the throat by Walter Grimes.
292060	297660	And all of a sudden you're sitting in a chair in a room, it's a pretty small room but it's
297660	304420	made to feel even smaller because it is filled with flowers.
304420	310900	So many flowers of all different varieties, shades and shapes that you've never seen before.
310900	316260	Sitting right in front of you is James, the executive director of Calm Comfy Campground
316260	321860	sitting behind a desk and he has a folder in front of him and he looks up at you.
321860	328100	Martin, go ahead and tell me a little bit more about Cube, I'm curious.
328100	335580	Because of the state that your brain is in currently, go ahead and roll Constitution
335580	340260	at a negative 40.
340260	345860	Well 80, so I failed that, but I also didn't have much chance, I have a 55, so.
345860	348500	Oh shit, yeah, that would have been rough.
348500	354100	So you, maybe for the first time in your life, maybe for the first time in a long time you
354100	358980	feel docile almost, you feel so pliant.
358980	366580	Well I mean, I'm not supposed to talk about Cube, but I'll let you in on a little secret,
366580	372420	yeah, you can know about Cube before the rest of the world, basically Cube is just a really
372420	379100	expensive personal computer, looks like a jellybean, obviously modeled pretty heavily
379100	382700	on the iMac, which was the thing in the late 90s.
382700	386540	Really it's just all marketing baby, that's all Cube is.
386540	394220	And how much money projected do you think that Cube is going to net?
394220	398780	If a sucker's born every minute then quite a bit, my calculations seem to show it's more
398780	404940	like 48.5 seconds, that's of course rising exponentially with global population, but
404940	410580	once we reach the crest of that, really you need to get in now within 30 years when the
410580	415180	population of western nations are plummeting and the markets aren't there yet in the developing
415180	420620	nations, there's just not going to be as many fools per capita to sell to, you really want
420620	421820	to get in right now.
421820	422820	Well consider-
422820	424780	On the verge of this new gilded age.
424780	425780	Me sold.
425780	426780	Sold.
426780	429420	You want to buy a Cube?
429420	436020	He flips open the folder and there's a thick stack of documents in there.
436020	437020	Please.
437020	440140	What do you get, what's that, what do you have there?
440140	450540	And he holds a pen out to you and you see on the folder it's titled Operation Hole Puncher.
450540	455920	And inside there's document after document after document and he hands you a pen and
455920	459180	he needs you to sign at the bottom of every page.
459180	466180	It's like, yeah, I'll sign whatever.
466180	468180	Is this ASMR?
468180	472540	Do you like that?
472540	475700	Man sits next to you and clicks pen, obnoxious.
475700	480780	I'm clicking my pen right now for you.
480780	482340	This is the worst.
482340	483340	It's the worst.
483340	490580	You're going to have to go to the Patreon to get that content, our ASMR Patreon feed.
490580	492820	Oh no.
492820	495500	Zach DM's you to sleep with.
495500	496500	Oh my god.
496500	500540	You're going to have to roll sanity for me.
500540	501540	For me.
501540	507500	You always say roll for me, which is like, seems a little bit like self-aggrandizing.
507500	512580	Roll it for me.
512580	515540	All right, Justin.
515540	520260	You were in the meeting room a second ago, wait, you're sitting in this room.
520260	521260	It's small.
521260	527740	It's made to feel even smaller by the overwhelming amount of flowers in this room.
527740	533540	Sitting across from you at a desk is James, the executive director of Calm Comfy Campground.
533540	538100	He's looking through a folder and he looks up at you and these flowers that are all around
538100	542220	you are the same flowers that you've seen all over the island.
542220	543220	What color are they?
543220	549180	All different kinds of colors, all different kinds of shapes, varied in many different
549180	550180	ways.
550180	552900	Charles, you take pictures, right?
552900	553900	Part of your job?
553900	555420	Yeah, pretty much.
555420	557820	That's almost all I do these days.
557820	563940	And you've got some pretty damning pictures of some fairly important people.
563940	564940	Is that correct?
564940	569120	Yeah, I can't quite say who, but yeah.
569120	570120	We know who.
570120	572620	And he's flipping through this folder.
572620	578100	Charles, you feel, go ahead and roll a constitution at a negative 40.
578100	581500	Oh, that's going to be hard.
581500	582500	What's your constitution?
582500	583500	55.
583500	584500	Oh boy.
584500	590500	Oh, I crit failed, 55.
590500	594180	It would have been a great success if you wouldn't have fucked me like that, Zach.
594180	599060	It wasn't me that fucked you.
599060	603420	You immediately list the people.
603420	610300	There was the mayor, there was this actor guy that people around here know, there was
610300	614060	a radio DJ, there was a city council member.
614060	615060	All right, all right.
615060	616060	Calm down.
616060	617060	Calm down.
617060	618060	I know.
618060	619060	Charles Digby's like, wait, why did I?
619060	620060	It's okay, Charles.
620060	621060	Why?
621060	622060	You're working with us now.
622060	626060	I need you to sign these here documents.
626060	631500	We're working together now as a team and we're going to need those pictures.
631500	634380	Yeah, whatever you need.
634380	640580	And you walk up to the desk and he's got this folder that says Operation Hole Puncher on
640580	641580	it.
641580	645700	And then he flips it open and there is a thick stack of documents there.
645700	646700	All right.
646700	648580	If you'll just sign and initial all these.
648580	649580	I'm doing it.
649580	651580	I'm getting in there very quickly.
651580	656580	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
656580	657580	All right.
657580	658580	Thank you for your time.
658580	659580	Thank you.
659580	660580	Oh no.
660580	661580	Oh no.
661580	662580	I don't like where the-
662580	668940	Roger, you were in that meeting room.
668940	673780	Walter just like goes to punch, wait, no, you're sitting in this room.
673780	679100	It's a small room and you're surrounded by flowers of every shape and shade.
679100	682380	They're the exact same flowers you've been seeing all over this island, but you're not
682380	683700	sure if this is a memory.
683700	687580	It feels like a memory.
687580	693280	It's a small room, but it's even smaller because of how many flowers are just surrounding you
693280	694740	in every direction.
694740	700620	And in front of you, there's a desk and behind that desk is James, executive director of
700620	701940	the calm comfy campground.
701940	707420	I need you to roll constitution at a negative 40.
707420	708780	Oof.
708780	710020	Dang.
710020	713260	43 on what would be a 30.
713260	716140	Roger, you were an archeologist.
716140	717140	Is that right?
717140	718140	Yeah.
718140	719140	Yeah.
719140	720140	And you're single, right?
720140	721140	Yeah.
721140	722140	Yeah.
722740	725780	And what is this dig site you're working on right now?
725780	729060	I mean, we don't exactly know it, but we're just calling it the nameless city right now.
729060	731980	We don't know exactly what civilization it belonged to.
731980	733300	We just found it.
733300	734300	Interesting.
734300	735300	Interesting.
735300	736300	All right.
736300	737300	Cool.
737300	741460	Well, basically today we're just here to sign some paperwork so that our partnership can
741460	742460	continue.
742460	743460	Yeah.
743460	744460	That sound good?
744460	745460	Sure.
745460	746460	Yeah, of course.
746460	750540	And you approached the desk where he's got a folder that he opens up and the folder on
750540	752980	the front says operation hole puncher.
752980	753980	Oh, damn.
753980	757940	I got to pull out my other notebooks, Zach.
757940	764020	And inside there's a document after document that he has you sign an initial.
764020	765020	Okay.
765020	766020	I do.
766020	768980	And he looks up and he's like, look forward to working more with you.
768980	772060	And you too.
772060	774740	What the fuck?
774740	784980	Walter, you reach out and just like slam Martin Cupertino in the throat.
784980	788180	And then all of a sudden you're just standing in this room.
788180	793020	Next to you is Alan Grimes, who you know as your handler.
793020	797400	And in front of him is a desk.
797400	801420	Behind that desk is James, executive director at Calm Comfy Campground.
801420	807000	This room is filled with flowers of all different shade and shape.
807000	812820	It's the exact same flowers that are covering the Island where calm comfy campground sits
812820	816240	and you are completely docile.
816240	820620	So Alan, you're saying that you've got more of these.
820620	821620	Yes.
821620	822620	Yes.
822620	824140	I've got, we have warehouses in Washington.
824140	828100	We have warehouses in Chicago, new Orleans, Las Vegas.
828100	830780	We have access to as many as you need.
830820	837900	Well, that is, that is something else and they'll just do whatever they'll just do whatever
837900	838900	you want.
838900	839900	Yes.
839900	840900	Yes, absolutely.
840900	844240	Hey, uh, Hey kid, touch your nose.
844240	845240	Walter touches his nose.
845240	848900	Luke touches his nose immediately, but Walter touches his nose.
848900	849900	Oh damn.
849900	850900	That shit's wild.
850900	851900	Slap your face.
851900	854180	Oh, it looks like it hurt.
854180	855180	Yeah.
855180	856180	I liked it.
856180	857180	He slaps his face.
857180	858180	Man.
858580	859580	Man.
859580	860580	All right.
860580	861900	Well, uh, shit.
861900	864160	Let's go ahead and take this partnership to the next level.
864160	870380	Let's sign some paperwork and Alan Grimes approaches the desk where James has a folder
870380	873060	that's labeled operation hole puncher.
873060	876100	And inside there's a bunch of paperwork.
876100	880420	Alan just signs and signs and initials and signs.
880420	883980	Alan turns back to you, salutes.
883980	887140	Thank you for your service.
887180	888180	Thank you.
894180	897180	Bad rolls out of the way.
897180	900180	It's like warming up at the free throw line before the game.
900180	903180	Let's clank a couple.
903180	906180	Visualize the failure.
906180	909180	That's what my mom tells me.
909180	912180	It's a real fucking bummer.
912180	914180	I'm sorry, man.
914180	915180	It's okay.
915180	916180	It's okay.
916220	917220	It's okay.
917220	918220	It's okay.
918220	920220	So in our last alone session, was the minotaur speaking English?
920220	921220	Yeah.
921220	922220	Okay.
922220	923220	Just kidding.
923220	924220	I remember that.
924220	926220	Y'all looked at me.
926220	929220	What the fuck happened to Joe?
929220	931220	Bradley Cooper, you like step back.
931220	937220	Like you just got punched in the throat and everyone's eyes just kind of cross each other.
937220	938220	Walter.
938220	942220	I'm sorry.
942220	944220	Just reflexes I guess.
944260	945260	You little bastard.
945260	946260	I didn't.
951260	952260	I didn't.
954260	955260	Cool.
959260	960260	And it's silent.
962260	963260	All right.
963260	966260	Now you're just milking it.
966260	969260	Somebody punch him again.
969260	971260	Walter, you didn't need to punch him.
971260	972260	That was.
972260	973260	What?
973300	975300	I mean, he was a reflex.
975300	976300	He touched me.
976300	977300	He did.
977300	978300	He did.
978300	979300	He did touch you.
979300	980300	That's true.
980300	981300	Are you okay, Brad?
981300	982300	I like walk over to him.
982300	983300	I kind of.
983300	984300	No.
986300	987300	Fuck you kid.
990300	991300	I hate this fucking kid.
991300	993300	I hate this calm, cozy campground.
993300	995300	I'm leaving immediately.
995300	996300	I'm gone.
996300	997300	I want a refund.
997300	998300	Where's James?
998300	1001300	Did anyone else just see James somewhere?
1001340	1004340	I just had a, was it a memory?
1004340	1008340	I'm having these weird flashbacks like we had last night.
1008340	1010340	That happened to you guys?
1010340	1013340	Was that a flashback or a dream?
1013340	1016340	I don't know, but I am so sorry.
1016340	1018340	I am so sorry, Walter.
1018340	1020340	I don't know what that was.
1020340	1027340	Walter kind of like squints at his dad and just kind of looks ahead and doesn't say anything else.
1027340	1030340	I was in a room full of flowers with him.
1030380	1032380	Were you guys in that room?
1032380	1034380	It was the flowers all around the island.
1034380	1037380	That's kind of an old trick.
1037380	1042380	We'd do it in the waiting room when we had to renegotiate contracts.
1042380	1047380	You fill it all with flowers so it looks like people really care about you and are thinking about you.
1047380	1050380	And it just makes the other person feel small.
1050380	1051380	I pegged it right away.
1051380	1053380	I definitely felt small in there.
1053380	1054380	They were.
1054380	1056380	Like you'd never been sent that many flowers in your life.
1056380	1057380	They were all around.
1057380	1059380	It made the room feel smaller.
1059420	1062420	Boy, whoever got these flowers must be important.
1062420	1064420	That's really the play there.
1064420	1066420	At least it was with us.
1066420	1067420	I think we need to find James.
1067420	1073420	If my recollection of the memory is correct, then I absolutely need to find James.
1073420	1078420	I think last we left off, I was kind of heading toward the door to get Angela back from him.
1078420	1080420	So I'm probably heading toward that door anyway.
1080420	1087420	Yeah, and when the door opens up, there are two people wearing staff clothing,
1087460	1093460	which you haven't seen before, but it is the calm, comfy campground staff uniform.
1093460	1100460	And it is like a one-piece jumpsuit with a collar that goes all the way up buttoned to the top.
1100460	1105460	It is a tall broad woman and a short scrawny man.
1105460	1108460	And they both have spray bottles in their hands.
1108460	1110460	Who the fuck are these boners?
1110460	1111460	What the fuck is that in their hands?
1111460	1116460	They immediately go to spray the two who are heading straight for the door,
1116500	1120500	which is Roger Fairfield and Bradley Cooper.
1120500	1121500	Can I athletics away?
1121500	1123500	Yeah, you can absolutely try.
1125500	1129500	Do you want to try to get out of the spray range there, Roger?
1131500	1132500	Yeah.
1136500	1137500	I fail.
1140500	1143500	They both fail miserably on their attempt to spray,
1143500	1145500	but something about seeing these bottles...
1145540	1147540	I got an eight on my attempt to help away.
1147540	1148540	Oh, hell yeah.
1148540	1149540	How do you get out of the way?
1149540	1151540	I just straight up like Neo.
1151540	1159540	The Matrix hasn't come out yet, so it's really innovative and revolutionary and shockingly cinematic.
1159540	1165540	But yeah, I just lean back away from the spray, duck behind the guy,
1165540	1167540	and I want to try to grab the spray out of his hands.
1167540	1170540	You do grab the spray bottle out of his hands.
1170540	1174540	Bradley Cooper, Charles Digby, Walter and Ellen Grimes, and Roger Fairfield,
1174580	1177580	you are all standing together in a cottage.
1177580	1182580	It is familiar because the setup is the same as the cottage each of you have been staying in.
1182580	1185580	However, this cottage is filled with surveillance equipment.
1185580	1190580	Screens line the walls, and you can see the grounds of Calm Comfy Campground,
1190580	1194580	the insides of Cottages 3, 5, 7, and 9,
1194580	1199580	as well as, it seems, the forests that surround Lake Calm.
1199580	1200580	Do I still have the bottle in my hand?
1200580	1201580	No.
1201580	1202580	Where are we?
1202580	1203580	Where the fuck are we?
1203620	1204620	Everybody roll alertness.
1209620	1210620	Fail.
1210620	1211620	69.
1211620	1212620	Fuck, I fail also.
1212620	1213620	Ooh, great success.
1213620	1214620	Ooh, nice.
1214620	1215620	Success.
1215620	1216620	Walter, nice.
1216620	1223620	Walter immediately looks down at his arm and sees that there is not a puncture,
1223620	1225620	like a mark of blood where there was.
1225620	1228620	Can I see if anybody else still has that?
1228620	1232620	If they'll show you their arms under their sleeves.
1232660	1236660	Do you guys still have, look, do you still have your mark?
1236660	1237660	Let me check.
1237660	1239660	No one has the mark.
1239660	1242660	Does it always seem to be the same time of year at Calm Comfy Campground?
1242660	1243660	It does.
1243660	1248660	And because you Chris Exceed, you actually will see on the surveillance footage.
1248660	1250660	What surveillance footage?
1250660	1256660	So the screens in front of you are showing all of Calm Comfy Campground essentially,
1256700	1263700	and you see there is a tall, broad woman and a short, scrawny man, both with a bottle
1263700	1270700	in their hand, heading toward a cottage, which you innately feel is this cottage.
1270700	1272700	We can set an ambush for him, boys.
1272700	1278700	Was the cottage, there was one that had like a tent, like a spray tent or whatever.
1278700	1279700	Sure.
1279700	1280700	Do we see that on the surveillance?
1280700	1281700	No.
1281700	1283700	Looking out the window, do I see it draped in a tent?
1283700	1284700	No.
1284700	1285700	Oh.
1285740	1287740	Which cottage do you think we're in?
1287740	1288740	Probably the one that was tinted.
1288740	1290740	What did you say, three, five, seven, nine?
1290740	1292740	Those are the ones you can see on the footage, yeah.
1292740	1293740	Which one was tinted?
1293740	1294740	Five was me, right?
1294740	1295740	Yes.
1295740	1296740	I was in nine.
1296740	1297740	I was in three, I believe.
1297740	1298740	And seven.
1298740	1299740	Yeah.
1299740	1302740	Those are the four that you guys are in, yeah.
1302740	1305740	Yeah, I think we're in that tinted cottage.
1305740	1309740	So is it before it was tinted or after it was tinted and then taken down?
1309740	1313740	No way to know yet, but it looks like we've got the jump on these fools.
1313740	1314740	We can see them coming.
1314780	1316780	What do you think they're doing with those bottles?
1316780	1317780	They're going to subdue us.
1317780	1320780	When you grabbed it, could you tell what was in it?
1320780	1326780	No, it's like some kind of controlling force sped us away from that moment before I could
1326780	1329780	investigate any further on that awesome roll I got.
1331780	1332780	It was a success.
1332780	1333780	What do you suggest that we do?
1333780	1336780	Well, I think you should go out to greet them.
1336780	1337780	Okay.
1337780	1338780	Wait.
1338780	1339780	Don't just greet them.
1339780	1340780	Run to the door.
1340780	1341780	Tell them to get in quick.
1341780	1343780	Tell them there's an emergency.
1343820	1347820	We'll wait in the hallways in the crevices.
1347820	1349820	We're going to, we're going to jump these fools.
1349820	1350820	Okay.
1350820	1351820	How far away?
1351820	1355820	Roger real quick wants to look around this room for anything that he can use to, uh,
1355820	1358820	uh, if we do subdue them to be able to tie them up.
1358820	1360820	So like cording or roping.
1360820	1363820	Hold towels in front of yourself so they can't spray you.
1363820	1365820	Yeah, you can, you can find ties.
1365820	1366820	Oh, okay.
1366820	1367820	Yeah.
1367820	1368820	What are those called?
1368820	1369820	Like zip ties?
1369820	1370820	Is that what you mean?
1370820	1371820	Okay.
1371820	1372820	I was hoping to be able to use my knot skill.
1372860	1380860	He's like, well, okay, if you've got to use cheaters knots.
1380860	1386860	Are there any big, uh, calm, cozy comforters like on the couch, like big knit, uh, there's
1386860	1390860	actually no, there's nothing in here except for surveillance equipment.
1390860	1395860	So there's not like a bed or any grab a monitor boys and we're just going to chuck it at their
1395860	1396860	heads.
1396860	1397860	Everybody grabs a monitor.
1397860	1398860	How heavy are the monitors?
1398860	1401860	They're like nineties action movie, little security camera monitors, right?
1401900	1402900	Yeah.
1402900	1403900	They're just all over the place.
1403900	1404900	Yeah.
1404900	1405900	And like stacked on top of each other and shit.
1405900	1407900	I just toss one to each of them.
1407900	1410900	How far away are the sprayers?
1410900	1412900	Uh, they're approaching right now.
1412900	1413900	I look at Martin.
1413900	1414900	Do I go now?
1414900	1415900	Do it.
1415900	1417900	I run out the front door.
1417900	1418900	How far away are they?
1418900	1419900	Can I see them?
1419900	1421900	They're, they're literally right in front of you.
1421900	1425900	There's, I like shut the door behind me so they can't see.
1425900	1429900	There's something is wrong in there.
1429900	1430900	Yeah.
1430940	1431940	In the face.
1431940	1432940	Like immediately.
1432940	1434940	As soon as they walk up to you.
1434940	1436940	What do we see happen as we're holding our monitors?
1436940	1437940	Yeah.
1437940	1443940	You guys are watching from, from inside and you just see, as soon as he gets sprayed immediately,
1443940	1447940	his chin goes down to his chest and he just stops moving.
1447940	1448940	Okay.
1448940	1449940	They turned him off.
1449940	1451940	Does the door open in or out?
1451940	1452940	In.
1452940	1453940	Well, yeah.
1453940	1454940	I just want to wait for them to come through the door and then we all check our monitors
1454940	1455940	at them, at their head.
1455940	1458940	After, after they've sprayed him, do they do anything with him or do they walk past
1458940	1459940	him?
1459980	1460980	They walk right past him.
1460980	1461980	Yeah.
1461980	1462980	They just keep moving.
1462980	1464980	And, uh, everyone roll humid.
1464980	1465980	Me too or?
1465980	1466980	No.
1466980	1467980	Shouldn't listen to.
1467980	1468980	Pass.
1468980	1469980	37 on a 60.
1469980	1470980	Pass.
1470980	1472980	Tell you what I'm told.
1472980	1479980	So you guys noticed that there is no emotion or anything on these two's faces.
1479980	1482980	There is just a blank expression.
1482980	1484980	Look, they're drone people.
1484980	1488980	If you accidentally clobber them too hard, you know, they go down for good.
1489020	1493020	You don't have to feel bad about it because clearly they're already dead inside.
1493020	1495020	So what's the plan from the inside?
1495020	1496020	Clobber.
1496020	1500020	Just as soon as they open the door, three monitors smashing down on their heads before
1500020	1502020	they can even fucking like see.
1502020	1503020	I'll try.
1503020	1504020	I'll try.
1504020	1505020	Martin.
1505020	1506020	I'm not, I'm not, I'm not a fighter.
1506020	1507020	I'm not a fighter.
1507020	1508020	I'm not a fighter.
1508020	1509020	Hey, hey, hey.
1509020	1510020	Pull yourself to fucking gather, man.
1510020	1513060	He's going to go kind of toward the back of the room, but be ready to throw.
1513060	1516780	While they were also searching, is there like a gun on any of the desks nearby or anything
1516780	1517780	like that?
1517780	1518780	No.
1519580	1524260	But you guys can, if you're all doing the monitor gig, I'd like to do a wield monitors.
1524260	1534580	You can roll athletics or strength and I'll give you guys an advantage of a Thomas.
1534580	1538460	You would take no advantage, but the other two can have a plus 20.
1538460	1545780	The reason you don't have an advantage is because you're using two.
1545780	1548660	I absolutely fail even with all the advantage.
1548660	1549660	Yeah.
1549660	1550660	Same.
1550660	1551660	Okay.
1551660	1556700	I rolled an 11 and a 100, but these are, are these contested?
1556700	1557700	Yeah.
1557700	1558700	Okay.
1558700	1559700	So you're fucked either way.
1559700	1561260	Well, what did you roll?
1561260	1564640	I rolled a 57 and my skill is 65.
1564640	1570340	So if we're doing highest without going over, I completely smashed two monitors on both
1570340	1571340	your fucking heads.
1571740	1574540	The 11 was a crit success, right?
1574540	1577820	But it's still for, but that doesn't count a contested rules, does it?
1577820	1578820	Yes, absolutely.
1578820	1579820	It trumps everything.
1579820	1580820	If it's a crit.
1580820	1581820	You've played this game, right?
1581820	1584380	Yeah, but this, these rules are weird.
1584380	1587940	Always have been, always will be, I suppose.
1587940	1592540	Only when you lose though, do they seem to be weird.
1592540	1596300	You just keep inventing conditions in which I can lose.
1596300	1599540	I turn back on and attack them.
1599540	1603540	No, you absolutely smashed one of them.
1603540	1606180	We'll say the tall woman who is extremely bright.
1606180	1607420	You were rolling for them.
1607420	1611900	These aren't my rules.
1611900	1613660	What game is this?
1613660	1616860	So you describe how one of them goes down.
1616860	1621180	Well, the first one through the door just gets like, I just straight up lob this monitor
1621180	1622620	right in their face.
1622620	1627660	They don't even see it coming, just like full fucking glass to the face.
1627660	1628660	They go down.
1628660	1633100	Oh, immediately, literally laying back on the ground with a TV on their head.
1633100	1636380	But that was my right hand and I'm not as good with my left hand.
1636380	1640060	And so the person immediately behind them has a little time to like see it and duck
1640060	1643100	and it's not as like strong or good a throw.
1643100	1644100	Roger, what did you roll?
1644100	1645580	A fail, a 97.
1645580	1646580	Okay.
1646580	1648340	And then we got a successor fail over here.
1648340	1649340	Fail 93.
1649340	1650340	Okay, fantastic.
1651060	1652060	All right.
1652060	1654500	So the other one is going to...
1654500	1658100	Can we just throw our monitors up into the air?
1658100	1660100	Yikes!
1660100	1666200	Immediately horrified, the little scrawny guy was not expecting this and he, still,
1666200	1669900	no scream, no holler, no anything.
1669900	1674540	And he just holds up his spray bottle and begins spraying and running toward you guys.
1674540	1677180	Is it like a squirty spray or like a misty spray?
1677180	1679460	It's a misty spray.
1679460	1680460	Luckily.
1680460	1681460	Yeah.
1681460	1683300	Can I do something to avoid that now?
1683300	1684300	Yeah, absolutely.
1684300	1685620	So this will be another contested roll.
1685620	1687300	Wait, is he going after the both of us?
1687300	1688300	He's coming after the room.
1688300	1689300	He's coming after the room.
1689300	1692140	You guys are all like right there in the front.
1692140	1693620	What are we rolling?
1693620	1695340	Athletics or dexterity.
1695340	1696780	Okay, let me try rolling again.
1696780	1697780	Or dodge.
1697780	1698780	And you roll the...
1698780	1699780	83.
1699780	1700780	Not a good fail.
1700780	1701780	Oh, okay.
1701780	1703780	Oh my God.
1703780	1706540	Do I get any bonuses to this one?
1706540	1707540	No, you do not.
1707540	1708940	I got a 53 on a 50.
1708940	1712700	I got a four on a 65.
1712700	1714580	He actually also failed.
1714580	1717260	So does he spray himself?
1717260	1718260	Not a crypto.
1718260	1719260	He does.
1719260	1720260	He sprays himself.
1720260	1723140	However, there seems to be no ill effect.
1723140	1724140	Okay.
1724140	1725860	I want to just fucking punch him in the face.
1725860	1729260	So literally what happened is he's spraying as he's walking and you guys all just like
1729260	1734780	walk into rooms and he's just like walking down the hallway with his arm out flat just
1734780	1739700	spraying it forward and then he's going to turn around and he's going to change the bottle
1739700	1744020	into his other hand and then spray and just walk down the hallway the other way.
1744020	1745020	Back out the door.
1745020	1746020	He's heading back through the hallway.
1746020	1748180	He's basically just trying to...
1748180	1749180	Corner us.
1749180	1750180	Yeah.
1750180	1751180	Yeah.
1751180	1752380	Whatever room I've ended up in now, can I see if there's a window that I could break
1752380	1753380	out?
1753380	1754380	Oh yeah, for sure.
1754380	1755380	What do I do?
1755380	1756380	You see a window.
1756380	1757380	I want to break it out.
1757380	1758380	Or open it.
1758380	1759380	Or open it.
1759380	1764380	I got to get out of here.
1764380	1765380	I'm going to slam my head through it.
1765380	1766380	It's bleeding all over everything.
1766380	1767380	The glass hurts so bad.
1767380	1768380	It's all worth it.
1768380	1769380	Open it.
1769380	1770380	Can I open it?
1770380	1771380	Yeah.
1771380	1772380	You open the window.
1772380	1773380	Okay.
1773380	1774380	I'm going to crawl out.
1774380	1775380	Okay.
1775380	1776380	Sounds good.
1776380	1777380	Justin, what are you doing?
1777380	1781660	Can I see if there's something I can use to bludgeon like something with some reach like
1781660	1785900	a bat or another monitor or something.
1785900	1786900	Yeah.
1786900	1789660	There's actually a...
1789660	1790660	Help me out here guys.
1790660	1791660	A tripod.
1791660	1792660	What would...
1792660	1793820	A tripod would be pretty good.
1794260	1795260	What could he use?
1795260	1796780	No, something far more.
1796780	1797780	There's like a...
1797780	1798780	Like an empty bed frame?
1798780	1799780	No, there's a...
1799780	1800780	A keyboard.
1800780	1801780	Fuck.
1801780	1802820	Tennis racket.
1802820	1804700	We're giving you golden things that can be in a cabin.
1804700	1806640	Loose wood panel on the floor.
1806640	1807640	There's a snowshoe.
1807640	1811140	There's a big hairy mean dog.
1811140	1812140	An old fishing pole.
1812140	1813780	An old fisher man.
1813780	1815780	A samurai sword.
1815780	1820780	I got a collection of samurai swords and bazookas in here.
1820780	1823120	Bazookas and grenades and land mines.
1823120	1826480	It's one of those things on the wall with the pinned insects on it.
1826480	1830280	There's a bigger spray bottle.
1830280	1835120	There's a spray bottle that says anti-spray bottles guy.
1835120	1837360	There's a taxidermied frog holding a banjo.
1837360	1838360	Ooh, that one.
1838360	1839360	That one, yeah.
1839360	1840360	That one.
1840360	1841360	That one.
1841360	1842360	There's a taxidermied frog holding a banjo.
1842360	1844520	I pick it up for violence.
1844520	1846320	Don't destroy that art.
1846320	1853080	God damn, now I want a taxidermied frog holding a banjo.
1853080	1855480	That's some quality folk art.
1855480	1860560	I want to hide around the corner if there's a nook of some kind where I can get a jump
1860560	1861560	on him.
1861560	1862560	Yeah, absolutely.
1862560	1863560	You got it.
1863560	1864560	Okay.
1864560	1865560	I'm just going to wait.
1865560	1866560	Does the door open in or out of this room?
1866560	1867560	There's no door.
1867560	1868560	Oh.
1868560	1875440	Well, there goes my plan to wang him on the head with a door.
1875440	1877800	What kind of taxidermy is in my room?
1877800	1881240	Ooh, a raccoon with a straw hat.
1881240	1882240	Yes.
1882400	1883400	And a reed.
1883400	1884400	Yeah, absolutely.
1884400	1885400	A long reed.
1885400	1889280	The reed is actually longer than the raccoon is tall.
1889280	1892160	I pluck the reed and I start chewing on it.
1892160	1897300	And I, yeah, it tastes like old glue.
1897300	1902400	And I hold this thing like a baseball bat and I'm also behind my corner just waiting
1902400	1903400	for him to come in.
1903400	1906320	When you say hold it like a baseball bat, are you holding it by the head and its feet
1906320	1907320	are standing up?
1907320	1908320	Or are you holding it by-
1908320	1911340	I'm holding it by the feet and its head is the club end.
1911340	1913840	And I imagine its arms are doing kind of cute things.
1913840	1917020	So those are kind of like little spikes coming out from it.
1917020	1921660	Yeah, that's like a D12 weapon at least.
1921660	1922780	At least.
1922780	1927660	He won't see either one of these attacks coming, so you guys can both roll with a plus 20 and
1927660	1928660	it won't be opposed.
1928660	1929660	Wang him.
1929660	1930660	Who goes first?
1930660	1932420	Both of you at the same time.
1932420	1934260	Is this athletics or?
1934260	1935260	You can roll-
1935260	1936260	Oh, this would be not-
1936260	1938260	This would be melee combat.
1938260	1940420	Oh, no.
1940420	1941420	Are you sure?
1941420	1943820	Oh, hell yeah.
1943820	1944820	Plus 20?
1944820	1945820	Yeah.
1945820	1946820	Okay, I have a 50.
1946820	1949180	I rolled a 52, but I have a plus 20, so limo.
1949180	1951340	Yeah, I failed big time.
1951340	1952340	97.
1952340	1954940	Okay, so thankfully the frog stays intact.
1954940	1956440	Oh, thank God.
1956440	1957940	That's all I cared for.
1957940	1960340	You swing right over this.
1960340	1964420	He's a very short fella and you were expecting the tall broad woman, right?
1964420	1966900	And so you swing right over his head, but thankfully-
1966900	1974020	Yeah, I see his shadow come through the doorway and I just wind up and fucking Sammy Sosa
1974020	1978940	this motherfucker right in his face with the raccoon teeth pointed out.
1978940	1984500	If I could catch those on an eyeball or something, I'm really trying to do maximum damage.
1984500	1992700	Yeah, you catch the teeth on an eyeball and his eye, as he hits the ground completely
1992700	2001740	unconscious, you see that there is the string essentially holding the eyeball in place,
2001740	2008460	is actually stretched fully out and you still are holding on to the other end and if you
2008460	2009460	kind of like-
2009460	2011620	Yeah, I try to get my raccoon loose.
2011620	2017580	Yeah, and his head is just like pop, pop, pop, like hitting against the ground.
2017580	2022940	When I finally give it the pull that rips the eye out with the raccoon and his head
2022940	2030620	flunks down to the ground, I bow and I say, Namaste and I walk out.
2030620	2038300	I also collect his spray bottle and I think I want to change into his clothes and I come
2038300	2042340	out into the room to do all that, so Justin just sees me in the process of becoming fully
2042340	2043340	nude.
2043340	2045780	There's no time to waste.
2045780	2046780	Oh, okay.
2046980	2049940	Can I go find the woman's clothes and change into them?
2049940	2050940	Yeah.
2050940	2052500	Okay, so I want to investigate this bottle.
2052500	2057620	It is just a spray bottle, there's absolutely nothing on it and you're looking at it and
2057620	2063400	you're standing in the meeting room for where you had orientation and you're looking over
2063400	2066540	the spray bottle that you have in your hand.
2066540	2067540	Dope.
2067540	2071660	Bradley Cooper is looking down at the spray bottle and when you do, you-
2071660	2073500	I think you can call me my real name now.
2073500	2074500	Oh, Martin Cupertino.
2074500	2075500	Who?
2075500	2076500	Oh.
2076500	2077500	Oh.
2077500	2078500	A billionaire?
2078500	2079620	What a billionaire.
2079620	2082980	Looking down at this spray bottle and as you're holding it-
2082980	2087820	I was really proud of that word and then I Googled it and it's definitely a thing.
2087820	2088820	Oh, yeah.
2088820	2089820	It makes sense.
2089820	2090820	Cupertino?
2090820	2091820	Yeah.
2091820	2092820	Garden?
2092820	2093820	Billionaire.
2093820	2094820	Oh.
2094820	2095820	Oh.
2095820	2101980	Cupertino was a very intentional choice.
2101980	2107620	I just like came up with that and it was wild.
2107620	2108620	That's what I thought you were saying.
2108620	2109620	I was like, yeah, man.
2109620	2110620	No, no, no.
2110620	2111620	Billionaire.
2111620	2113460	Uh, well, you know what they say.
2113460	2114460	There was a...
2114460	2115460	Uh, no.
2115460	2116460	Oh, well.
2116460	2117460	Who?
2117460	2121740	Um, stop it.
2121740	2126540	So when you look down at this bottle, you see that there is a piece of tape on it and
2126540	2136020	written on the piece of tape is the word Sanfera Blom, S-A-N-F-E-R-R-A space B-L-O-M.
2136020	2137620	Sanfera Blom.
2137620	2138700	Yes.
2138700	2143340	And as you're holding it, real quick, Roger Fairfield, roll an intelligence check for
2143340	2145860	me.
2145860	2148380	I pass a 43 on a 75.
2148380	2156060	You would recognize that name from the book that you're reading of the flora in the area.
2156580	2157580	Nice.
2157580	2158580	I remember it as a plant.
2158580	2159580	Yes.
2159580	2165420	And Martin Cupertino, you smell this bottle like it is pungent and you can smell.
2165420	2168820	It's the exact same smell of the flowers that are all over this island.
2168820	2169820	Cool.
2169820	2172500	Can I remember details about what I read about it?
2172500	2174720	Guys, guys, guys, everybody shut up.
2174720	2175720	Shut up.
2175720	2176720	Shut up.
2176720	2178900	Remember all the flowers blooming in the city.
2178900	2180900	Oh, I don't.
2181140	2183140	That's a different character.
2188140	2190140	I remember though.
2190140	2191140	Yeah.
2191140	2192140	Nice.
2192140	2193140	Interesting.
2193140	2199300	You get five luck points for not this character, but maybe in the future when we're using
2199300	2200300	luck.
2200300	2201300	Right.
2201300	2202300	Write it down.
2202300	2203300	I'm just going to...
2203300	2204300	Yeah.
2204300	2205300	Zach owes me a debit of five luck.
2205300	2207900	That's exactly right.
2207900	2213260	So Bradley Cooper, Charles Digby, Walter and Alan Grimes and Angela and Roger Fairfield,
2213260	2219140	you are all in this meeting room with the walls that round off at all the corners.
2219140	2227020	And there is these two people, this tall broad woman and this short scrawny man are both
2227020	2232320	on the ground and you're holding one of the bottles and the other bottle is across the
2232320	2236060	floor and it's been opened and it is just like in the corner.
2236460	2239340	It's spilling out of the room.
2239340	2244500	I want to spray the guy next to me in the face and fucking book it out of the room.
2244500	2245500	Okay.
2245500	2246500	What's everybody else doing?
2246500	2249700	Is Angela being there a thing?
2249700	2250700	Yeah.
2250700	2251700	We'll see.
2255420	2256420	I pass.
2256420	2257420	No.
2257420	2258420	It's not a thing.
2258420	2259420	Okay.
2259420	2260420	Hey, Angela.
2260420	2262180	Hey, Raj.
2262180	2263180	This is crazy.
2263180	2264580	We need to get the fuck out of this room.
2264580	2266260	I feel like I was just coming to see you.
2266260	2267260	That's weird.
2267260	2268260	Yeah.
2268260	2269260	I think we got to get out of here.
2269260	2270260	Right?
2270260	2274100	You're looking at me, but Martin Cupertino has fled.
2274100	2275100	Yes.
2275100	2276100	Real quick.
2276100	2277780	What are the Grimes doing and what is Charles Digby doing?
2277780	2279220	I look at Alan.
2279220	2280220	What is he doing?
2280220	2285180	He's shaking his head back and forth and his jowls are just flopping about, little bits
2285180	2291740	of spittle are going everywhere as he's just very confused about what's going on.
2291740	2294020	I'm going to just wait there for a second.
2294020	2297140	You're going to what?
2297140	2298140	Just wait there for a second.
2298140	2299140	Okay.
2299140	2300140	Charles Digby.
2300140	2301300	I think I'm going to book it with Martin.
2301300	2306060	As soon as you guys get to the door, the door opens and Jack Russell is standing there,
2306060	2311820	short stout man, and he's like, we need to get the fuck out of here immediately.
2311820	2313220	Are you kidding me?
2313220	2314220	What?
2314220	2315220	I think you got him.
2315220	2316220	You got him.
2316220	2321020	I'm glad he said that because I was about to spray him in the face.
2321020	2322020	What happened when-
2322020	2326580	You hold the bottle up and I'm like, if you're with, that's actually hilarious.
2326580	2329780	If you're with them, I'm going to spray your ass down right now.
2329780	2333820	His hands go straight up in the air and he's like, no, Mike, there's no way that I'm with
2333820	2334820	him.
2334820	2335820	I'm trying to-
2335820	2336820	I believe you.
2336820	2337820	I found your go hole.
2337820	2338820	You didn't have a bag, really.
2338820	2350420	You didn't have a go bag, but you had a hole full of supplies underneath my floorboards.
2350420	2351980	I put my hand in the hole.
2351980	2353700	Do you have the syringe?
2353700	2357020	No, I forgot about that the first time.
2357020	2358020	Check your pockets.
2358020	2359020	Check your pockets.
2359020	2360020	See what you brought with you.
2360020	2361020	I check my pockets.
2361020	2362020	You have the syringe.
2362020	2363020	It pokes you and you die.
2363020	2364020	Oh, yep, there it is.
2364020	2365020	Ow!
2365020	2366020	I do.
2366020	2367020	Did that peak horribly?
2367020	2368020	Probably.
2368020	2369020	Say ow again.
2369020	2370020	I check my pockets.
2370020	2371020	Ow!
2371020	2372020	Yeah, I have it.
2372020	2380380	No, I probably didn't peak the first time.
2380380	2382980	What happened when he sprayed the guy?
2382980	2383980	Literally nothing.
2383980	2389680	Those people are blank, and when they fell, they just kind of stayed down.
2389680	2395820	But when you look over at them now, they're slowly getting back up with just a look of
2395820	2397220	nothing on their faces.
2397220	2399980	Are they getting up like people get up, or are they getting up in-
2399980	2402020	They're getting up like people get up.
2402020	2404180	I don't recognize these people at all, do I?
2404180	2409100	You would just recognize them from this weird out of place memory that you have of being
2409100	2410960	in cottage number 11.
2410960	2414320	These aren't the same attendants who we've seen before?
2414320	2420700	They were the same attendants that you saw in cottage 11 who sprayed Walter Grimes.
2420700	2423660	Are they getting up kind of like on their hands and knees?
2423660	2427680	I'll describe how they get up just to really put it down there.
2427680	2431740	So they're both on the ground, and they both put their palms on the ground-
2431740	2432740	In a weird way?
2432740	2433740	Like people do?
2433740	2436820	And then slowly move their feet up toward their palms.
2437540	2438540	Oh, okay.
2438540	2440380	So just like a normal person would.
2440380	2441380	Exactly.
2441380	2445260	And then once their feet and palms are both like next to each other, then they slowly
2445260	2450620	remove their palms and release towards the sky while exhaling.
2450620	2453820	Listener Zach is on the floor doing all this.
2453820	2454820	Doing yoga in front of us.
2454820	2455820	And it looks exactly like how a human looks.
2455820	2459060	I got a lot of mic for this one.
2459060	2464100	So as they're doing that, I want to go over to the guy, and while he's like still hands
2464100	2471420	on the ground, I want to get behind him and put my hand under his jaw and try to rip.
2471420	2473580	Good call.
2473580	2477740	As if maybe it's a removable face.
2477740	2478740	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2478740	2479740	No, I get it.
2479740	2480740	Exactly.
2480740	2483900	We all got where you're going with that.
2483900	2487620	Okay, roll unarmed combat.
2487620	2489620	Unfaced combat.
2489620	2490620	Fail.
2490620	2493020	90 on a 49.
2493020	2499980	Yeah, as you put your hand underneath his jaw, he grabs onto your hand and begins to
2499980	2502740	slowly move it away from his face.
2502740	2504900	And he turns around to face you.
2504900	2509020	And he holds up his hand like he has a spray bottle in it, but he doesn't.
2509020	2513020	And he's trying to like moving his fingers like he's spraying you in the face.
2513020	2515020	Okay, I'm going to run away.
2515020	2518860	Hey, real quick, how do you have a 49?
2518860	2521860	I have a 55 now.
2522700	2523700	Whoa.
2523700	2524700	I don't...
2524700	2525700	Okay.
2525700	2530060	Zach gave you some fun mechanics.
2530060	2532660	Luke asks, and I like to say yes.
2532660	2533900	All right, so...
2533900	2539060	Can I get better at beating people up every time I don't beat someone up?
2539060	2541060	Yeah, sure.
2541060	2542060	Why not?
2542060	2543060	Zach, I would like that too.
2543060	2545900	This story won't go that long, probably.
2545900	2548980	All right, so what does everyone know?
2548980	2551300	I mean, these two aren't going to be an issue, right?
2551300	2557820	And so, and then he looks up and his eyes cross Angela's and his eyes get really big
2557820	2558820	and he's like...
2558820	2561420	I'm so sorry.
2561420	2569780	I just noticed the bottle of hand sanitizer that we have in front of us as a very sassy
2569780	2571200	like font.
2571200	2573300	And it says, what did you touch?
2573300	2578300	Oh my God.
2578300	2579700	What did you touch?
2579700	2580700	What did you touch?
2580700	2587700	Which is exactly what Jack Russell says to Angela Fairfield.
2587700	2588700	What did you touch, honey?
2588700	2589700	What did you touch?
2589700	2592700	What did you touch?
2592700	2597140	Honey, what did you touch?
2597140	2601860	And she begins backing away slowly from everyone.
2601860	2604540	Honey, you all right, Angie?
2604540	2606060	Yeah, no, I'm fine.
2606060	2607380	I'm confused though.
2607380	2610620	Is everyone cool here?
2610620	2611620	What has happened?
2611620	2612620	Are you guys good?
2612620	2613620	Yeah, we're cool.
2613620	2614620	Are you cool?
2614620	2615620	Do you have any weed?
2615620	2617620	I feel like we never got to the bottom of that.
2617620	2619220	Oh, we got to the bottom of it.
2619220	2620580	Do you have anything on your hand?
2620580	2621580	I brought weed.
2621580	2622580	Yeah, it's no big deal.
2622580	2623580	Will you pass me a J?
2623580	2624580	Is this the time?
2624580	2628340	Yeah, canonically, I just kind of want to get this done.
2628340	2629340	Okay.
2629340	2632740	And she just reaches into her little clutch and throws you a joint.
2632740	2636860	Okay, I'm going to add a syringe and a joint to my inventory.
2637860	2638860	The classics.
2638860	2639860	Yep.
2642860	2643860	Woof.
2643860	2648340	Can I roll human to see if something's fucky with her?
2648340	2649340	Yes.
2649340	2650340	Can I do that too?
2650340	2651340	Yes.
2651340	2654140	Do we all even see her?
2654140	2655140	Yes.
2655140	2656140	Okay.
2656140	2657140	I passed my human troll.
2657140	2658140	I failed.
2658140	2662540	Charles Digby, you know that she is extremely nervous and confused.
2662540	2663540	Okay.
2663540	2665540	Honey, you seem nervous and confused.
2666220	2668740	Why don't you come with us?
2668740	2669740	Yeah.
2669740	2672380	Yeah, no, I'll come with you guys.
2672380	2675460	Do you guys remember if she was with us the last time?
2675460	2676820	What are you talking about?
2676820	2677820	Of course.
2677820	2678820	In the cabin?
2678820	2680100	She wasn't with us in the cabin.
2680100	2681100	Out of character.
2681100	2682100	Yeah, she was not.
2682100	2683100	Out of character.
2683100	2684100	No, I was asking in character.
2684100	2685100	Yeah, in character.
2685100	2686100	What the fuck is going on?
2686100	2688100	What are you guys talking about when you're in the cab?
2688100	2690580	We've just been waiting for James.
2690580	2691580	Waiting for James.
2691580	2692580	Is that all you think you've done here?
2692620	2698100	Well, I do remember James came in, and then I thought that you left with him, and then
2698100	2699820	I was going to come and get you, and then you...
2699820	2703660	No, we were all just waiting for him to come in because we're having another meeting.
2703660	2706780	I think we need to run now and talk about this later.
2706780	2708380	Yeah, we're going to run.
2708380	2710060	You can come with us if you want.
2710060	2711180	We're going with Jack Russell.
2711180	2712180	Roger, come with us.
2712180	2713180	Yeah, yeah.
2713180	2716100	Wait, but you said we were waiting for James to come in.
2716100	2718200	Yeah, we were waiting for James.
2718200	2719260	So he hasn't come in yet.
2719260	2721020	That means that maybe he's coming.
2721020	2722980	Why don't you stay here and find out?
2722980	2723980	Roger, come.
2723980	2725140	We need to go now.
2725140	2726140	And I grab him.
2726140	2730100	I pat him on the shoulder, like, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's
2730100	2731100	go.
2731100	2732100	Honey, come on.
2732100	2733100	We should follow them.
2733100	2735020	Yeah, okay, but what are we doing?
2735020	2736700	Why are we leaving?
2736700	2737700	There's something wrong.
2737700	2739700	There's something wrong.
2739700	2741860	They're spray bottles, and they're...
2741860	2748460	Zuhur Ilknei, Zuhur Ilknei, Zuhur Ilknei, Bradley Cooper, Charles Jacobi, Walter and
2748460	2754540	Alan Grimes, and Roger Fairfield, you are all sitting in a half circle facing a single
2754540	2758740	empty chair in the meeting room where you had orientation.
2758740	2760900	Everyone roll Constitution.
2760900	2762940	Except for Bradley, who crit.
2762940	2765780	Oh, well, he just passed again.
2765780	2767420	59 on a 60.
2767420	2768420	Nice.
2768420	2769420	Fail.
2769420	2771820	I pass a 14 on a 70.
2771820	2775620	Okay, everyone take your headphones off except for Justin.
2775620	2776620	Yay.
2776740	2778580	Don't hurt me too bad, Zai.
2778580	2786260	Okay, Justin, I need you to play on this one like you don't remember like anything from
2786260	2790980	all of these confusing plot points like you just got here and everything's normal.
2790980	2791980	Cool.
2791980	2792980	You ready for that?
2792980	2793980	So like I just first arrived?
2793980	2795980	Yeah, like you're fresh and ready to go.
2795980	2796980	Right, okay.
2796980	2798340	Okay, everybody back.
2798340	2799620	It's weird.
2799620	2802740	It's weird how well that works.
2802740	2808300	The listener can't see us, but usually we go out of the room when it's short, Zach just
2808300	2811860	has us take our headphones off and then we just like press our ears.
2811860	2812860	Ear flap?
2812860	2813860	What do you call that part?
2813860	2814860	Yeah, right.
2814860	2815860	It has a name.
2815860	2816860	Tragus.
2816860	2817860	I'm sorry, whoa, what is it?
2817860	2818860	Tragus.
2818860	2819860	A tragus.
2819860	2820860	Ear anatomy.
2820860	2825980	If you just slam your tragus on both sides, you get a roar in your ear.
2825980	2827180	Oh, okay.
2827180	2828180	Can you guys?
2828180	2829980	Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
2829980	2830980	Ear rumble?
2830980	2831980	Oh, the ear rumble, yeah.
2832220	2834060	I didn't know everybody couldn't do that.
2834060	2836700	I think most people can because- It's called the tragus.
2836700	2839700	Yep, that's what I said.
2839700	2841420	You're acting like Luke.
2841420	2843660	Good job, Luke.
2843660	2844660	We both are right all the time.
2844660	2845660	Thanks.
2845660	2847660	I've got both my mind pierced, so that's how I know.
2847660	2848660	Oh.
2848660	2851020	You can't tell because I have headphones on.
2851020	2852620	Did you actually in the past get your tragus?
2852620	2854260	No, I've never had anything pierced.
2854260	2855260	Anything?
2855260	2859340	My PA, I've got a Prince Albert, but that's it.
2859340	2861540	You would look really good with some piercings.
2862100	2864100	I thought you were going to say it with a Prince Albert.
2864100	2866100	You would look so hot.
2866100	2870500	Obviously, everybody would look great with a Prince Albert.
2870500	2875180	I just think Luke could really rock some funky tragus piercings.
2875180	2877580	I don't think if I got anything pierced, it wouldn't-
2877580	2879580	It would be your dingus.
2879580	2881580	I don't know what I would get.
2881580	2882580	Your dingus.
2882580	2883580	We'll think about it later.
2883580	2885020	I'll let you know at the end of the episode.
2885020	2886580	So you guys are sitting in this room.
2886580	2887620	It's just you guys.
2887620	2890860	The spray bottles aren't in here, the two people aren't in here.
2890860	2892100	Angela's not in here.
2892100	2893940	How's our memory working right now?
2893940	2896700	Do we remember spray bottle guys in the room?
2896700	2897900	You do, but they're not here.
2897900	2898940	This place sucks.
2898940	2900900	Why did you guys come here if it sucks?
2900900	2903140	Aren't we all coming here to get better?
2903140	2904820	Angela wanted us to get better, yeah.
2904820	2905820	That's good.
2905820	2906820	Yeah, I-
2906820	2907820	What?
2907820	2908820	Wait a minute.
2908820	2909820	What?
2909820	2910820	What are you so-
2910820	2911820	What?
2911820	2912820	Why are you so protective of this place and its agenda?
2912820	2913820	What agenda are you guys talking about?
2913820	2914820	I'm not talking about an agenda.
2914820	2916420	I thought we were just here for therapy.
2916420	2918140	You've seen what's happened here.
2918140	2919140	Don't you remember?
2919140	2920820	Charles Digby's getting scared.
2920820	2921820	What's going on?
2921820	2922820	Do you not remember?
2922820	2923820	We were all just here.
2923820	2924820	But it was different.
2924820	2925820	Right?
2925820	2926940	Am I fucking losing my mind here?
2926940	2927940	I remember that.
2927940	2928940	Yeah.
2928940	2929940	I remember.
2929940	2930940	No, this is my- I just got here.
2930940	2932940	And this is like our orientation, isn't it?
2932940	2933940	Or-
2933940	2934940	Oh, damn it, Digby.
2934940	2935940	Did they spray you?
2935940	2936940	Who are you?
2936940	2937940	I'm Martin Cupertino.
2937940	2939580	I'm a Silicon Valley billionaire.
2939580	2941260	Oh, I read about you.
2941260	2942260	Yeah.
2942260	2944860	Definitely not taking pictures of people like you before.
2944860	2945860	I want to go over to-
2945860	2947500	I am a paparazzo.
2947500	2950580	And put my hand on his jaw and rip.
2950580	2951580	You?
2951580	2952580	On Charles.
2952580	2953580	See if he's-
2953580	2954580	Okay.
2954580	2955580	Well, this young kid-
2955580	2956580	I contest.
2956580	2958340	And a Metallica shirt walks up to you.
2958340	2959340	Hey, what are you doing?
2959340	2960340	Do we need to do it?
2960340	2961340	Yeah.
2961340	2962340	I mean, if he's going for it.
2962340	2963340	Unarmed combat.
2963340	2964340	38 on a 55.
2964340	2965340	Oh, shit.
2965340	2966340	Uh-oh.
2966340	2967340	Fuck.
2967340	2968340	41 on a 60.
2968340	2969340	Oh, wait.
2969340	2970340	No, let me do it.
2970340	2971340	I thought it was below.
2971340	2972340	You rip his face off.
2972340	2973340	Yeah.
2973340	2974340	I kill him.
2974340	2975340	I kill the boy.
2975340	2987500	All right, Luke, describe the beginning of what you do, and then we'll let Justin describe
2987500	2989180	how he combats that.
2989180	2993780	Like, after he is saying all that, I just kind of look at him weird, and I just stand
2993780	2999500	straight up, walk right over to him, and with just my pointer finger and thumb right behind
2999500	3001260	his cheek, just try to-
3001260	3002260	Yeah.
3002260	3004580	So at this point in time, what's Charles Digby doing?
3004580	3008360	I just grab the hand and pull the finger back.
3008360	3011660	Not break it, but pull it back to be like, what are you doing?
3011660	3012660	Yes.
3012660	3014180	Walter, get away from this man.
3014180	3017080	I don't think we can trust him.
3017080	3018300	Why can't you guys trust me?
3018300	3021460	Charles, what's going ... You don't remember anything?
3021460	3024860	I've never met you guys until today.
3024860	3028420	Have we already done the true truths and a lie in this room?
3028420	3029420	Yes.
3029420	3030420	Well, yeah.
3030420	3033540	Of course we have, but we've also done a lot of other ... Do you remember when there
3033540	3034660	were spray bottles?
3034660	3035660	The spray bottle thing?
3035660	3038340	No, I don't know what you guys are talking about.
3038340	3041980	I'm a little ... Maybe I need to go talk to James.
3041980	3043820	No, no, no, no, no.
3043820	3046180	I kind of start getting up and walking towards the door.
3046180	3047180	Father, I'm confused.
3047180	3048180	Sorry.
3048180	3049180	We all just made eye contact.
3049180	3050180	I say, sorry.
3050180	3054180	I'm trying to tackle you now.
3054180	3055180	Awesome.
3055180	3063500	27, not great for a contested unarmed combat role.
3063500	3064500	He's trying to tackle you.
3064500	3067860	I don't think I'd notice because I'm walking ... I'm assuming you're tackling me from behind
3067860	3068860	or something.
3068860	3069860	Yeah.
3069860	3070860	So it just happens.
3070860	3071860	Yeah.
3071860	3072860	Didn't say how you tackle me.
3072860	3073860	Yeah.
3073860	3075820	What's his body feel like on your body?
3075820	3076980	What's your body look like?
3076980	3077980	Average.
3077980	3081860	It feels like an average.
3081860	3083660	Average sort of tackle.
3083660	3086180	It doesn't feel like the NFL or anything.
3086180	3087180	That's good.
3087180	3089920	It's small compared to that because he's average.
3089920	3092720	As this is happening, I look at Roger.
3092720	3094240	What was your wife saying?
3094240	3095240	Oh yeah.
3095240	3098760	She was saying ... Can I remember what she was saying?
3098760	3099760	Role intelligence.
3099760	3102760	Oh fuck, I fail.
3102760	3105880	A 78 on a 75.
3105880	3107600	No, you can't quite remember.
3107600	3111200	Fuck, neither can Joe.
3111200	3112200	It was something weird.
3112200	3113440	It was weird.
3113440	3114440	It was like a chanting kind of thing.
3114440	3116320	Have you ever heard that before?
3116320	3118440	No, never.
3118440	3119440	Is that the correct answer?
3119960	3120960	Have I never heard her do that before?
3120960	3121960	I have no idea.
3121960	3123960	I don't know you.
3123960	3124960	Walter, tell me.
3124960	3126760	Have I heard it before?
3126760	3127760	You've definitely heard it.
3127760	3129760	Do you remember Tuesday?
3129760	3133320	No, you have never heard that before from Angela.
3133320	3136480	There has to be something in this room that gets us somewhere else.
3136480	3140520	It was the spray bottle once and then when she chanted that, we came here.
3140520	3141520	Oh God, no.
3141520	3145360	It was something strange and I don't ... But now she's not even here and everything-
3145360	3146360	Yeah.
3146360	3150160	Hey, buddy, you know your wife's in on this, right?
3150160	3151160	And she's probably not your wife.
3151160	3152480	Is she not here with us right now?
3152480	3153480	No.
3153480	3154480	Is Martin on top of me while this is happening?
3154480	3155480	That keeps happening.
3155480	3156480	Yeah, I'm on top.
3156480	3157480	I turn around.
3157480	3161680	Am I like struggling or like ... You didn't say you were, so I just thought
3161680	3162680	you were lying flat.
3162680	3163680	He's just admitted.
3163680	3164680	I'm sorry.
3164680	3166760	I was just like, I give up.
3166760	3167760	You got comfy.
3167760	3168760	I'm sad.
3168760	3171760	You're like actually the weight of another human being for the first time in a while.
3171760	3172760	Yeah, it's really nice on my back.
3172760	3173760	Oh, yeah.
3173760	3175560	I like getting sat on.
3175560	3177280	That's why I'm here.
3177280	3180160	Can I do a search to see if there's anything out of place in this room?
3180160	3181160	You can.
3181160	3184000	10 on a 43.
3184000	3188400	Nothing is out of place in this room except for maybe that Angela Fairfield isn't here.
3188400	3190560	Is anything two in place?
3190560	3193800	I don't know what that means.
3193800	3195880	You actually looked at me like you were going to let me roll?
3195880	3196880	Yeah.
3196880	3197880	So maybe that's exactly what it is.
3197880	3198880	You can roll.
3198880	3199880	64.
3199880	3200880	No.
3200880	3205480	Oh, then you don't learn the cool thing.
3205480	3211280	Can I struggle to get up or am I like, did you tackle me from behind or are you just
3211280	3212280	like-
3212280	3213280	Yeah, I've got you pinned, I think.
3213280	3214280	I've got you.
3214280	3215280	Yeah.
3215280	3216280	Can I try and, is there like a struggle mechanic?
3216280	3217280	Yeah.
3217280	3219280	I mean, it's unarmed combat.
3219280	3220280	Oh, okay.
3220280	3221280	Yeah.
3221280	3222280	Do I have advantage because I've pinned him?
3222280	3223280	You do.
3223280	3224280	You have a plus 20.
3224280	3225280	Fuck.
3225280	3228400	Oh, I didn't pass.
3228400	3229400	I did pass.
3229400	3230400	I'm like-
3230400	3231400	How do you keep him down?
3231400	3234760	46 on a modified 90.
3235080	3236080	Yeah.
3236080	3238480	No, like with no apparent effort.
3238480	3239480	Yeah.
3239480	3240480	I've just got him pinned.
3240480	3242520	Comfortably in a pressure lock.
3242520	3245920	And I'm still just turned around like, you know your wife's not real, right?
3245920	3247360	Half the time she's not even here.
3247360	3252820	I'm doing the thing where the only thing that's moving is my neck and I'm like, but no part
3252820	3255200	of my muscles are moving.
3255200	3260280	One of my arms is pinning you down, but another one is gently rubbing your back, just trying
3260280	3263080	to calm you down like a pig or something.
3263120	3264840	Now I'm more confused.
3264840	3265840	I'm like, what?
3265840	3266840	I don't-
3266840	3268040	I'm just trying to temple grand in you.
3268040	3269840	I'll just squeeze you.
3269840	3270840	Calm me down.
3270840	3274080	While this is happening, I'm just going around touching everything in the room.
3274080	3275080	Okay.
3275080	3276080	I feel you just like touch my chin.
3276080	3278080	I'm like, what the fuck?
3278080	3284560	Roger, when Martin is on top of Charles Digby and he's looking at you saying that your wife
3284560	3287200	isn't real, how are you responding?
3287200	3288400	Of course she's real.
3288400	3289400	She's my wife.
3289400	3290400	I don't understand.
3290400	3292160	I don't understand how she wouldn't be-
3292240	3294080	I feel like we've seen you go through this before.
3294080	3297400	The door opens and Angela is standing there.
3297400	3298400	See there.
3298400	3299400	Hey guys.
3299400	3300600	Hey Angela, are you really his wife?
3300600	3302880	Her eyes get really big.
3302880	3303880	Yeah.
3303880	3304880	Why?
3304880	3308360	I'd like to humant that.
3308360	3309360	Roll humant.
3309360	3310360	Oh shit.
3310360	3311360	Uh, fail.
3311360	3312360	Yeah.
3312360	3313360	85 on a 60.
3313360	3315680	I don't understand the line of questioning, honey.
3315680	3316680	I don't either, Angie.
3316680	3317680	Where's this going, Martin?
3317680	3318680	Come on, man.
3318680	3319680	She's never here.
3320000	3322160	I mean, sometimes she is, but like when shit goes down.
3322160	3323520	Why are you on top of-
3323520	3324520	Martin?
3324520	3327880	I thought you were Brad Lee Cooper.
3327880	3331880	Brad Lee Cooper.
3331880	3332880	That's right.
3336480	3337480	Angela, help.
3337480	3339600	Go get James and get me out of here.
3339600	3340600	What's happening right now?
3340600	3342200	I didn't come here to be treated like this.
3342200	3343720	This is supposed to be a nice calm-
3343720	3344720	Oh, that's right.
3344720	3347000	That's why I'm on you because you wanted to get James.
3347000	3348000	Yeah, actually-
3348000	3349000	Angela.
3349320	3353800	She takes one step back and shuts the door and she's on the other side of it.
3353800	3354800	Angie?
3379000	3380000	Yeah.
3380000	3381000	Yeah.
3409040	3414040	I'm tired of coming.
3414040	3420040	I think that you could fall.
3420040	3428040	I knew I'd make you believe.
3428040	3432040	Cooler than you could lose me.
3439000	3440040	Yeah.
3469040	3474040	Now I think you could swallow me.
3474040	3481040	Corner room in at least right.
3481040	3485040	Corner in at least right.
3499000	3500040	Yeah.
3529040	3530040	Yeah.
3530040	3531040	Yeah.
3531040	3532040	Yeah.
3532040	3533040	Yeah.
3533040	3533040
