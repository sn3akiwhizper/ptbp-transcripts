0	3120	Hello, and welcome y'all.
3120	6360	It is December the 6th, and my clock here says
6360	10120	it is 1030 a.m. here in the city.
10120	12400	What time is it in your world?
12400	14440	What is time anyway?
14440	16560	Is it a circle or some shit?
16560	18820	Shit, I don't know, that's for sure.
18820	23820	Well, anyway, I'm coming at you live from 694.2 PTBP,
24560	27920	this dimension's best radio show
27960	32660	that is fueled by dumpster meat of varying quality.
32660	36200	I've got a howlin' with wolf here from an anonymous source.
36200	38280	Remember, if you wanna write up somethin'
38280	41120	for your wolf to howl, tag at PretendingPod
41120	44160	on Instagram or Twitter, tag PretendingToBePeople
44160	46600	on Facebook, or write a five-star review
46600	50320	and email us at pretendingpod at gmail.com.
50320	55280	This one is a bit unsettling, so no point in settlin' in.
55280	57840	We alone are the last of the line,
58720	60120	ascendant when the giants walked
60120	63600	and still clutching to power when the last ragged outpost
63600	66240	of our kind fell to internal ruin.
66240	68160	Our line will rule again.
68160	70280	There are secrets buried still,
70280	72680	lost in the deserts forgotten and places
72680	74720	where man cannot go.
74720	76700	Our illusion is perfect.
76700	79360	We walk unseen through the streets
79360	82280	in the child scrawl of the world before us,
82280	87200	and we resist the call to feed, the smells, the meat.
87240	90880	We resist, for there is clarity and starvation.
90880	92480	Just as in our disguises,
92480	94780	there is freedom among the savages,
94780	98920	and then in the desert where we buried our last machines,
98920	100760	there is salvation.
100760	102060	Well, fuck.
102060	104080	Once they started talkin' about meat,
104080	106920	I just kinda lost track there, y'all.
106920	111440	Anyway, things aren't any cleaner or clearer here in the city
111440	115800	It's uncertain, it's impure, it's the news.
115800	119640	Stan Manstein left the city asylum, a rare occurrence,
119640	121240	in order to speak at the funeral
121240	123680	of his daughter, Ari Manstein.
123680	125740	He was accompanied by three guards,
125740	128040	all made out of flesh and wire.
128040	130040	He spoke in a strange tongue,
130040	133440	and the world slowed down around our three officers
133440	136000	who heard Stan speak inside the heads,
136000	138400	tellin' the story of a particular past
138400	140480	of the town of contention.
140480	143880	Clark Bishop shot Stan Manstein mid-story,
143880	145600	bringin' the world up to speed
145600	148640	and causin' full-blown chaos at this funeral.
148640	150560	People began to run for their lives
150560	154880	as our obliviously intrepid heroes fought, shot,
154880	158520	and demolished the large guards made of blood and metal.
158520	162540	Keith Vigna plugged Stan Manstein's wounds with his fingers,
162540	165560	givin' him just enough strength to complete his story
165560	168040	and blip out of existence.
168040	169980	John Lee Pettymore IV,
169980	172680	inside the body of his adopted father,
172720	174600	John Lee Pettymore III,
174600	176680	who the officers met as Kevin,
176680	178740	Marvin Glass's head of security,
178740	181380	tried to explain that whole convoluted mess
181380	183920	to his former coworkers.
183920	186720	The officers took stock of their situation,
186720	189520	tryin' to remember where the weird items they'd found
189520	191220	are currently located.
191220	195720	Last we saw, John Lee Pettymore put his hands up to his head
195720	198240	and his eyes turned white.
198240	199560	Man, I tell you what,
199560	202840	I left contention because of all this weird nonsense,
202840	205140	but it seems to have followed me to the city.
205140	206800	Wolf.
206800	209400	Oh, no, Wolf.
209400	213240	What if you're the source of all this pain and sufferin'?
213240	215320	What if I am the sinner
215320	218520	from which all struggles emanate from
218520	221180	the pulsating heart of darkness?
221180	224080	Does it all come from little old Wolfie?
226440	228720	Uh, probably not.
228720	231040	I have a message here from my producer.
231040	235040	They say we are sitting at 84 reviews on iTunes.
235040	238800	That's about 16 reviews short of bein' real nice,
238800	243800	and 336 short of bein' real nice.
244000	246600	So we got a super special announcement in mind
246600	248920	for when we hit that 100 review mark.
248920	251480	You'll be happy, Wolf'll be happy,
251480	253000	and when Wolf is happy,
253000	255840	he claps his hands on the three and the four.
255880	259060	It's kazoo with no backbone.
259060	260680	No.
289060	300940	John, as your eyes roll backward, your vision goes dark.
300940	307280	Images begin flashing through your mind, just snippets, moments, and you try to keep up.
307280	315780	As the speed of this sequence waxes and wanes, you see a motel safe, shiny, black, and closed.
315780	322540	You see the sign for Bean's Pond, the little pond behind Chief Maggie Cook's house in contention.
322540	324140	You see a television.
324140	332300	It is blinking with different letters on it, R, S, T, L, N, E. You see a small clearing
332300	336540	in the woods, and the ground is scorched.
336540	343180	In a dark room, lit by various electronics and machines, you see a massive, shiny metal
343180	349740	sphere, 20 feet tall, with silvery arms extending from either side.
349740	354500	A tube connects this gargantuan ball to a machine below.
354500	360740	The machine begins whirring, and you see a small metal sphere, roughly one inch in diameter,
360740	366700	begin moving up through the tubing into the larger, armed version of itself.
366700	371700	As this happens, a vast circle opens up in the ceiling, and a disorienting amount of
371700	377420	light and sound pours into the room, revealing text painted on the back wall that says the
377420	389260	same thing you hear violently chanted by an unseen crowd, Planet Juggernaut.
389260	394780	The scene changes again, and you see Marvin Glass standing at his desk in the grand room
394780	399440	you recently stood in as Kevin, alongside Rosemary.
399440	405080	Marvin is holding the odd camera with glass tubes, closely inspecting it, tapping its
405080	407180	lit red luminaire.
407180	415000	On his desk are two file folders, splayed open, entitled, The Real Files on Clark Bishop
415000	424040	& Keith Vigna, Contention Police Officers, subtitled, Oh That Cunning Marvin Glass, subtitled,
424040	431720	Zach Was Being Lazy.
431720	439480	You can see in Keith's file are various clippings about the Beenz family, the tragic
439480	445440	accidental deaths of William and Lena, Keith's parents, the takeover of the family business
445440	447160	by Ferguson.
447160	452720	In Clark's file, there is a newspaper article about the murderer who killed Clark Bishop's
452720	455920	parents and love.
455920	463040	There is a mugshot of a woman smiling, a cold, vacant smile behind asymmetrical bangs covering
463040	464720	one of her eyes.
464720	471560	Written in Sharpie, underneath the mugshot, it says in all caps, Karen.
471560	476520	Your vision readjusts, and you are standing in the mid-morning sunlight near your partners,
476520	483160	Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna, in the wake of a funeral gone terribly awry.
483160	486160	That was, uh, that's one hell of an info dump.
486160	492040	Zach, you will be pleased to know that I already have, um, Am Love and Karen written down in
492040	493040	my notes.
493040	494040	Oh, yes please!
494040	499700	But I don't expect the listeners to remember all the fucking shit that happened to John
499700	502360	Lee Pettymore four or five episodes ago.
502360	503360	Sure.
503360	504360	Because I didn't.
504360	505920	Had to go back in and listen to that?
505920	509080	Had to listen to it again and wrote it all down on my phone.
509080	510080	Absolutely.
510080	512120	So, uh, with that I need you to lose ten luck.
512120	514960	Uh, let me find my character sheet.
514960	515960	Luck.
515960	517640	Okay, I'm at twenty luck now.
517640	519100	Down to twenty luck.
519100	521680	No longer able to survive if you die.
521680	524920	But I can avoid major damage and some other things.
524920	528160	Alrighty, let's get the other boys in the room and kick this thing off.
528160	529160	Let's do it.
529160	530160	Ramona.
530160	531160	Ramona.
531160	532160	Ramona.
532160	533160	Ramona.
533160	534160	Ramona.
534160	535160	Ramona.
535660	535760	Ramona.
535760	536260	Ramona.
536260	537080	Ramona.
537080	538700	Ramona.
538700	539860	Meow meow meow!
539860	540460	Ramona!
540460	540960	Woof!
551780	552800	Oh my goodness.
553800	565840	I think we can get him on the podcast.
565840	566640	He's probably dead.
567200	571240	I bet it's pretty easy to get the Numa Numa guy on the podcast if he's not dead.
571560	572720	What do you think he's up to these days?
572760	576600	He's either dead or he's making shitty podcast appearances.
578200	580840	He was a question on Ask Me Another a couple of weeks ago.
580960	582320	The Numa Numa guy was the answer?
582360	582680	Yeah.
582680	583080	Nice.
583160	584840	Did they accept the Numa Numa guy?
584840	585720	Was that the answer?
585720	587080	Or did they have to know his name or something?
587080	587920	Oh no, it was the Jimi.
587920	590160	You had to know Boris Fonks-Kold.
590200	590840	Yeah, right.
592040	593200	His name is actually Dr.
593200	594320	Carbuncle McPhee.
597640	599640	Little shout out to the Patreon listeners.
599680	601560	Yeah, last week.
601560	601920	Dr.
601920	603000	Carbohydrate Uncle.
603040	610080	On Monday, we released our second Patreon exclusive episode in which we played Everyone is John.
610160	610880	It was delightful.
610880	611560	It was a lot of fun.
611920	616600	It's where we all play John Peters in the moments before his death.
616600	618440	In the moments before he turns into a dog.
618440	619960	You try to save John Peters.
621160	622280	Let's play this dang old game.
622320	623800	I'm going to vape in the mic real quick.
627080	628160	Throwback to the old days.
628200	629640	Man, I wish you wouldn't do that.
629720	631240	We didn't even do that in the old days.
632520	634000	It's on, I think, the first episode.
634960	637440	Yeah, and you're instantly reprimanded.
638440	649880	Keith Vigna and Clark Bishop, you look over and the eyes that have rolled back into the back of John's head are now right back where eyes normally are.
650160	652320	And he looks at you with a startle.
652520	653840	John, what's going on?
655240	655840	A lot.
657120	657480	What?
657560	657920	Yeah.
657960	659280	Are you, are you with us?
659920	666280	All right, well, so boys, I don't know how to tell you, but I think I developed the second set.
666680	672680	At least I believe I developed the second site in my transition from John to Kevin.
672720	673600	What did you just see?
673880	680240	Perhaps I just unlocked something I always had within me, but I feel slightly less lucky.
680320	681320	And here's what I saw.
684840	688040	I saw, I saw a motel safe and hotel motel.
688360	689320	Oh, shit.
689400	692320	I saw Bean's pond behind Maggie's house.
693080	703240	I saw television blinking random letters, perhaps not so random, and I saw a small clearing in the woods where the ground was scorched.
704720	706320	I saw some other things, too.
706840	708880	Marvin Glass has the camera.
709720	711880	It's currently in his possession.
715480	721160	What else I saw was perhaps too terrible to repeat right now.
722160	728040	I know what you saw, the lockbox, the safe at hotel motel.
728440	728760	Yeah.
729280	733280	I have, I have my brother's watch in there.
734880	745120	I got it after his unfortunate demise, but I put it on and some real weird shit happened.
745120	749720	I felt like I was like on an alternate plane while I had it on and I knew I had to take it off.
750240	756400	I know it means something, but I, I couldn't have it on my body cause it was just doing some fucked up shit.
756400	760160	So I threw it in my safe in my hotel motel room.
760520	763520	Keith, can you describe that alternate plane?
764280	766480	Was it as though the ground were made of light?
767800	773320	No, I just, I, it's not that it took me physically somewhere else.
773320	780560	I was still in contention or around there, but in my mind I was seeing different stuff.
781360	788000	It was hard to decipher what was real and what I was seeing, but I knew it was something, it just felt evil.
788000	793760	And I had to throw it in that safe cause I thought the longer I had it on the weirdest shit was going to happen.
793760	799200	And I it's, it means something I'm sure, but we'll, we'll have to go check that out.
799200	803760	And I think with the three of us together, cause I was by myself when I had it on.
803760	809400	So I think had I had it on just by myself for a while, I might've gone insane or something.
809440	812520	That, uh, that watch didn't have tubes like all of our other objects.
812520	817560	No, it's just a, just looks like a nice, like gold Rolex watch.
817880	820040	Does being spawn mean anything to y'all?
821480	827360	I mean, it's at behind Maggie's house and yeah, I just, I believe I have the second side.
828240	841200	And when I thought about the objects, these are the things I saw and I saw Marvin glass with the camera, but then I don't know, it sounds like Keith's describing an object of, of power that he put in that safe.
842240	844240	What can be in these other places?
844400	849560	The, uh, those letters on the television, did you, uh, you have to remember them?
849640	857080	I do R S T N L N E.
857880	861800	What were you saying that right or wrong?
868320	875520	Cause I said S and you said L, but I have a T there's an L in there though in there after the T I know, I know what those are.
875520	878360	John and Keith, you even might know what those are.
878440	879680	R S T L N E.
879880	883200	Well, that's the wheel of fortune letters.
883320	883960	Exactly.
883960	889360	They're the letters they give you at the end of wheel of fortune, but that's, that's not all fellas.
892560	892960	Yeah.
895040	895440	Wow.
895520	906120	I never would have imagined when I, uh, fellas, when I came to, I, uh, well, Keith, you don't, Keith, I got to show you something.
906440	908240	Clark pulls up his shirt and shows Keith.
908280	908960	Holy shit.
909000	909360	All right.
910360	910720	Keith.
910720	922440	When Clark lifts up his shirt, you see that there is a hole in Clark's chest as if his body has been gauged like an earlobe.
922480	924120	So it's kind of healed over through.
924160	929080	Can I see all the way through skin tunnel leading you through his body.
929120	938800	When I woke up with this, I had a, I had a bag with me and there was, there was, well, I, what I think is my heart.
939120	945840	In the bag with ice, but next to it was another bag and it had those letters in it.
946640	948000	That's fucked up, man.
948040	952280	It's somebody who knew that I watched wheel of fortune every night.
955040	955480	Well, okay.
955480	956920	Well, that looks all right.
956920	964560	So one thing I also saw, uh, Marvin glass knows a lot more about us than we might've originally suspected.
964560	968640	Um, he knows a lot.
968680	970520	He knows everything about your history.
970880	971600	Oh shit.
971640	974040	Clark, I've got something to tell you.
974240	975560	I don't, you might already know.
977080	980040	All right, boys, let me actually start at the beginning.
982200	988560	We're not the first group of three to try to combat this kind of stuff.
989200	991560	What do you mean before us?
992560	994520	There was a group called K cell.
995360	996760	K cell was Kevin.
997120	1001760	You see standing before you, your, your father adopted father.
1001800	1002320	Yeah.
1003000	1003600	What?
1003920	1012680	So it was Kevin man named Kyle and a woman named Karen, also known as an love.
1014240	1017160	What the and love killed your parents.
1017880	1023440	Clark stares in bewilderment and a little bit of like anger just at here in the name.
1023880	1029320	I don't know why Marvin glass turned the grip against itself.
1029680	1032040	And Karen was the only one to get away.
1032920	1042720	He made Kevin shoot Kyle and, and he essentially took over, took over his life, his soul in some way.
1042920	1046200	And Kevin was his soldier from then on out.
1047160	1051360	Marvin glass was looking for, for the metal sphere.
1051680	1052480	He has one.
1052520	1056960	That's what agent McKinley and Kennedy were trying to neutralize was a silver ball like that.
1057000	1057360	Yeah.
1057400	1058240	Why does he want them?
1058880	1059560	I don't know.
1059840	1060680	I saw something.
1062520	1064080	I saw something pretty terrible.
1064080	1067520	Just now, all these people want these fears.
1067560	1070880	We found one Marvin glass was one on one for years.
1070880	1071560	He has one.
1071560	1072840	He wants to know how it works.
1073800	1078240	Just now, just now I had a vision of something, something strange and terrible.
1079040	1085480	It was like one of those fears, but massive, gigantic, gargantuan.
1087480	1094840	It had arms coming out the side and a little tube coming up the bottom and up that tube.
1094840	1103400	I watched one of those fears go one of the small spheres and a, a huge light opened up in the ceiling.
1104240	1106600	It was like the ceiling was, was revealing itself.
1106600	1108440	So this thing could, could come through.
1109600	1117120	And all around I saw these letters, these words, it said planet juggernaut like that.
1117120	1118880	Fucking the bedding stuff we found.
1118960	1120520	Yeah, exactly.
1120520	1122240	Keith Clark.
1122240	1126200	Sorry, sorry.
1126200	1131920	The transition to my new body is a wrecked havoc on some of my neurons.
1133760	1136280	I don't even know if I have neurons really.
1137120	1139040	Shouldn't I have this asshole's memories?
1139600	1141520	Do I have this asshole's memories?
1141560	1144040	I'll try to access this asshole's memories.
1144040	1158800	While not being able to access the memories of Kevin, previous to you being inside of his body, you think that that might be a hint as to why you have, quote, the second sight.
1159360	1160120	Interesting.
1160280	1164600	Guys, I was just, I'm thinking about what we heard Stan talking about earlier.
1164840	1165480	Oh yeah.
1165760	1167120	Thinking about it more.
1168120	1179040	When I had Fergie's watch on, I remember, well, it clouded my mind cause I felt like I was going inside, inside, inside in the membrane, inside in the brain.
1179080	1181600	That's how Chick-fil-A makes their chicken.
1182240	1183920	Oh, that sounds good.
1184600	1186800	Uh, I remember it's coming back to me.
1186800	1194120	I, when I had it on one of the feelings I had was like, I felt like wet grass and dirt on my fingers.
1194120	1202920	And I remember seeing a metal door, like buried almost slightly underneath this grass and, and, and dirt.
1202960	1209520	And it said, here lies the beans, scientists beyond measure, saviors of the world.
1209760	1218160	And as soon as I saw that, I think that's when I had ripped the watch off of my arm and went and thrown it into the safe.
1219160	1222560	So like, are you more capable than you've been letting on?
1223560	1225120	Are you a scientist without measure?
1227720	1228240	No.
1228240	1229440	Do you feel that within yourself?
1236760	1244320	I am almost positive that somewhere along the beans line, there's something I don't know.
1244360	1245560	It could be my parents.
1245560	1251120	It could be my grandparents, but it was somebody related to you that came in and solved their.
1251720	1254440	Uh, Silas and Mary Cole problem back in the day.
1254480	1258400	It was, it was Cornelius beans and somewhere down the line.
1258400	1267480	I don't know who would have been the scientist, but we, I don't know where to find whatever I saw in that, but I feel as if it's real.
1267480	1271200	And we, I think maybe there's something in that that we need to check out.
1271360	1273320	I might know a little bit, something about that.
1274520	1275120	What do you think?
1275400	1279200	Well, I know that I personally came from Cole's orphanage.
1280160	1282840	John Lee Pettymore, the third adopted me from there.
1283600	1285160	I don't know who my real parents are.
1285360	1289880	Cole's orphanage, new school under modern etiquette.
1289960	1294640	So Kevin, John, everything you're saying right now is going a little bit above my head.
1294640	1300720	You're adopted by John Lee Pettymore, but you're in Kevin's body, but you're in your dad's body.
1300720	1302200	The only, Oh, right.
1302200	1303880	John Lee Pettymore, the third is Kevin.
1304760	1307640	He was part of K cell remember, but here's the point.
1307640	1311600	I think maybe the beans adopted you too.
1312400	1315600	I think maybe we all spent some time in Cole's orphanage.
1316080	1317480	No, my parents are my parents.
1317520	1318680	How can you be so sure?
1318720	1319920	They were my parents, Keith.
1319960	1321440	How are you sure about anything?
1321480	1324600	You know what we've been through the past six fucking days.
1325120	1326520	How can you be sure of anything?
1326520	1327720	I'm not sure of anything.
1329080	1330080	I'm sure they were my parents.
1330080	1335960	Keith, they had to have been, you know, my daddy was my daddy.
1336640	1338000	And your daddy is your daddy.
1338280	1341360	We just came from different penises.
1345320	1347320	Then the ones what raised us.
1347400	1348360	Where were we?
1350160	1352040	My brother from another penis.
1354680	1358240	Where were we when we had that spell cast on us as children?
1358480	1362120	Oh, that was, that was at clankers at the daycare daycare.
1362120	1362440	Yeah.
1362480	1362760	Okay.
1362800	1365560	Well, why were we all at that same daycare together?
1366200	1369200	If we might not have all come from the same orphanage.
1369560	1371080	You ever think about that Clark?
1371480	1374080	I mean, here's the only daycare in town.
1374080	1377680	I just figured, yeah, that one's that's a little tough to say.
1377680	1381000	Cause it's not like there's not great childcare options and contention.
1382440	1383800	It's it's the bar.
1384760	1385600	It's the bar.
1385600	1388000	Like they're the only ones willing to do it.
1388040	1390200	I love cut up hot dogs and Bud Light.
1390240	1390600	I see.
1390600	1391520	That's that's a,
1392000	1393560	I'll always have a soft spot.
1396720	1396880	Yeah.
1396880	1400000	What are you going to ask someone who's not Harry clinker to watch your kids?
1401440	1402440	What would Harry say?
1402440	1404440	He's the best one for the job.
1404440	1408400	Obviously it'd be crushed 36.
1408440	1414880	John, do you shout out, John, do you have any, do you see anything else or that's a lot of information to take in, but I think
1414880	1419880	I know it's like an info dump, but Keith, I got to, I got to ask you something.
1419880	1421560	It's, it's kind of tough though.
1422040	1422320	Yeah.
1422640	1425520	Well, I've had a tough week, so I think I can handle.
1425600	1434200	You know, my, my memory has been pretty dang spotty lately, but one of the last things I do remember was we were
1434200	1441720	standing in Glass's office and boy, it sounded an awful lot like he hired you to kill your brother.
1443320	1445640	And you, you, you asked where the money was.
1447480	1452080	Well, since, I mean, we're all working together again.
1453080	1462880	I don't know what the point in hiding this from you is anymore, but, uh, I didn't know that it was Marvin Glass hiring me to do this.
1462880	1470880	My, my niece, she found me and she offered me a million dollars to kill her dad.
1471320	1479920	And I don't know that I've talked a lot about Fergie, but, uh, it's not, it's common knowledge that him and I didn't get along
1480200	1482080	since, since we were boys.
1482280	1483280	In fact, I hated him.
1483560	1492200	And so when that opportunity rose, I never thought about killing my brother, but the chance to become a millionaire and get rid of that asshole.
1492440	1493200	I jumped at it.
1494320	1503400	So I went and, uh, I didn't kill my brother, but I guess you could say if it wasn't for me, he'd still be alive today.
1503400	1511560	So, uh, when I saw my niece with Marvin Glass and the scientist lady, I knew what I got myself into.
1511680	1513560	Did you recognize that scientist lady?
1513560	1514640	Was she anybody to you?
1514680	1518960	Only person in that glass building I knew was my niece.
1519400	1522520	I had no idea she was affiliated with people like that.
1522920	1532960	Keith, uh, I happened to encounter your niece's, your niece's bedroom and she's getting up to all kinds of weird, impossible math.
1533920	1540080	Does that sound, yeah, she, she was, she was writing out equations that couldn't have been from this world.
1540120	1543440	Well, you know, if there's anything you want your niece to be into math, isn't that bad?
1543480	1545080	Yeah, it could be worse.
1546280	1547640	It could be one letter off.
1549040	1551360	Uh, no, the thing is, I don't know much.
1551400	1557440	I haven't been, I hadn't, I have not been in contact with my niece.
1557480	1562160	It seemed at the time that, uh, that, that scientist lady was maybe training her in some way.
1562200	1567520	I mean, I kind of got that idea too, but I was mostly just pissed off that I've, I think they were trying to screw me.
1567560	1570800	I don't think they had any intent on giving me that million dollars.
1570800	1578960	That's the reason I was even going to work for Marvin was to repay the debt of him rebuilding me.
1578960	1580880	And he said, he'd give me that million dollars.
1581720	1584040	Keith, did you know you was saved by fish men?
1584160	1587360	I, I, yes, I saw them.
1587360	1589520	And what do you think about, what do you think about that?
1590480	1593800	Uh, I don't know what you think made them fish, man.
1593800	1599960	Can we get, I just saw a reaction shot from Clark bishops, fish, man.
1602040	1610120	My already spinning head is spinning even while more wildly fish, fish, man, man with the face of fishes.
1610160	1614160	So I saw, I was much more concerned about getting out of glasses building.
1614240	1618520	I saw them and it freaked me the fuck out, but I did get help from a fish boy.
1618920	1620280	Uh, so they're not all bad.
1625000	1627880	They're doing some weird shit over in that glass building.
1627880	1631880	I assure you, I can't, I don't fucking know.
1631880	1634000	I got the, I got out of there.
1634000	1638600	I accepted, I accepted the proposition from Marvin glass and I came to the funeral.
1638600	1639400	That's all I know.
1639840	1645000	Fish boy, you were talking to a fish boy, Peter, little Peter.
1645240	1646200	Oh my God.
1646200	1649080	God, my God.
1650920	1654600	What are fish, what are fish people doing?
1654640	1660920	I don't know, but they apparently, I don't know how I got rebuilt other than the power of Marvin glass.
1660920	1662280	You keep saying rebuilt.
1662280	1663760	I mean, what does that even mean?
1663760	1664600	I died.
1664640	1665000	Yeah.
1665000	1665600	I'm back.
1665600	1667520	I said he was the new Charles.
1667520	1670000	You want to know how I got these scars?
1673000	1673760	That's a big one.
1673800	1674840	You got on your hand there.
1674920	1675320	Yeah.
1675400	1675760	Clark.
1675760	1677160	That'll come into play later.
1677320	1681160	Are you not going to give him credit for shouting out our favorite movie in the precinct?
1682480	1684360	The one we all used to watch together.
1684640	1686280	Ace Ventura, pet detective.
1686320	1686800	No.
1686840	1687840	Batman forever.
1687880	1688400	That one.
1691560	1693840	You guys, obviously you can see the scars.
1694200	1697720	I'm not exactly sure what's going on in here.
1697840	1702840	Uh, I have a slight idea, but, uh, I, I don't know.
1702840	1708120	I don't want, I don't really want to talk about it until I figure it out, but I don't, there's nothing you need to worry about.
1708280	1709160	I'm on your side.
1709160	1709680	I promise.
1710760	1716720	And that sounds, that sounds real suspicious, but I mean it, I promise we talked about this already.
1716960	1718840	John Kevin's eyes, narrow.
1720200	1729360	John, you mentioned that, uh, that those silver balls that everybody's apparently after that you said something about Marvin wanting to use it.
1729360	1730720	Do you know what that means?
1730880	1739080	Years ago when, when Marvin turned Kevin on Kyle, the thing you wanted to know was how the balls worked, what they did.
1739560	1745080	I haven't seen anything suggesting what that is other than making the big ball work.
1745240	1753880	Do you think that there might be some of those silver balls in the silver in the gun and the camera and the radio and the helmet?
1754120	1755000	That's interesting.
1755680	1758320	I hadn't thought of that Keith, but I mean, who knows?
1758360	1761560	We, we considered them pretty important, so we never cracked them open.
1761560	1765160	But I don't know that we should, but we've only got one correct.
1765200	1767680	We've got the ball, one silver ball, right?
1767680	1772800	We put our, it disappeared into our bag, but I think that bag is still, it wasn't ours.
1772800	1774400	The agents brought one.
1774440	1775080	We got one.
1775200	1778120	I think it's still in the skull of that lady, right?
1778160	1780360	No, John has it.
1781000	1781520	You do?
1782080	1785800	John just picked it up and he's had it ever since.
1786280	1787520	Is it at your house or?
1788320	1793600	No, I don't know how much that's my house anymore.
1794240	1799320	I mean, I still like Smokey, but, uh, here's the thing boys.
1800240	1803040	That was kind of always on my person.
1803440	1804920	I just had it in my pocket.
1806120	1808880	I didn't, it was a comforting wait.
1808920	1810200	I didn't know what it did.
1811040	1815600	Uh, so you're saying it was on the old John, it was on John, your previous John.
1816120	1818320	So Marvin has it.
1818360	1819440	Most likely.
1819480	1820280	Yes.
1821800	1825280	You know, a lot, a lot's happened in a real short amount of time.
1825840	1827160	Real, real quick for us.
1827200	1827600	Sure.
1827600	1828320	Absolutely.
1828360	1832800	It could get a little head spinning, but, uh, agent, uh, McKinley and agent Kennedy,
1832800	1838200	they, they tasked us with neutralizing the threat, I believe was part of their MO.
1838240	1840440	And then we were supposed to call them back there.
1840480	1842000	They're twisting in the wind right now.
1842000	1842920	As far as I know.
1843000	1843240	Yeah.
1843280	1845000	Shouldn't they be doing something?
1845040	1846520	Who do they work for?
1846520	1847600	Are they on the glass?
1847600	1850320	Well, they said the FBI, but who knows?
1850840	1853560	Also, it's been a hell of a week.
1853600	1855680	I had all my days of running together.
1856000	1860440	How long ago was it that we saw agent McKinley two days ago?
1860440	1866560	What did they, they, they said if we didn't call back in 48 hours, they'd call us.
1866600	1872320	You would assume based on the timing that it is right about now that they would be
1872360	1875000	calling the contention police department.
1875040	1876880	Um, and I'm all out of minutes.
1877000	1879880	I want to get you guys, I want to call drew real quick.
1880000	1881160	You've been in touch with drew.
1881360	1884240	He was, he said he, I have not in voicemail.
1884280	1886240	Yeah, but I want to call him and see if they'll answer.
1886280	1889600	You called him after you listened to the voicemail that he sent.
1889680	1894080	And I believe his phone went straight to voicemail.
1894120	1894480	Yep.
1894560	1895960	And I want to try it again.
1896360	1903840	Bring, bring, bring, bring, bring, bring, bring, and it does the same this time.
1904040	1906520	Well, so did they say they'd call the police department?
1906520	1907800	I think we were supposed to call them.
1907800	1912520	They gave us a number that we could, but they said if we didn't call within 48
1912520	1914200	hours, they'd be in contact with us.
1914240	1915240	I think that was the deal.
1916200	1920600	Hopefully they have their self, our cell phone numbers then I don't have any idea
1920600	1922840	where that card with their number would be.
1922880	1924240	I mean, we would just have their number.
1924320	1930160	I mean, what if we just all go in and start a fucking, you know, like hot wings
1930160	1933920	restaurant or something and let them take care of contention.
1934120	1935800	They were going to come back in two days.
1935840	1938600	We've got alibis, new lives.
1938640	1939440	We disappeared.
1939480	1942080	If they're working for glass, that's a hot wings.
1943680	1946960	Well, if they're working for glass, I don't think they would have given us that
1946960	1949160	bag that gets rid of the balls.
1949160	1951560	They would have taken it unless those balls get sent.
1951800	1954520	If they get put in the bag, they get sent to the thing that John saw.
1954560	1956480	I don't know why they would have left the bag with us.
1956520	1957880	That's an interesting proposition.
1957880	1959240	We would be doing their job for them.
1959240	1962040	If they're working for glass, we'd find some balls and keep putting them in the
1962040	1963240	bag and they keep going to the...
1963240	1966240	Now maybe, but it seemed like they was awfully scared of those balls.
1966240	1968040	What if we gave them a call?
1969560	1970520	We've got their card.
1970520	1971400	We got their number.
1973120	1974280	What's the worst that can happen?
1974280	1976360	We can try to decide whether we trust them or not.
1979040	1980160	What do you guys think?
1980320	1984240	Both of Joe and Clark don't know about that.
1984240	1988600	And Keith, I mean, who knows who they are though now.
1988640	1991520	It's going to be a couple hours till they get in contact with us.
1991520	1993640	They told us that we might as well give them a call.
1993640	1998920	See, I don't know that we have the upper hand, but if we have any sort of, if we're
1998920	2003000	doubting that we can trust them, you know, we can call them and see what they're
2003000	2003360	saying.
2003360	2007640	And we might try to be able to get something out of them because we know about
2007640	2008600	glass and everything.
2008600	2012280	We might be able to get something out of them before they can, you know, get to us.
2012360	2016440	Let's, let's, let's take a step back now fellas, now that we've laid all our cards
2016440	2017040	on the table.
2017040	2021440	What, what do we want to do to, to prevent calamity?
2021600	2027040	I mean, a lot has changed, but it sounds like the glass family has some real bad
2027040	2029080	designs on the town of contention.
2029800	2032400	I've seen things that make me think the world's in jeopardy.
2033200	2037280	You have the glass family after you had maybe the glass family is our, our first
2037320	2037840	thing.
2037840	2041520	The glass, the glass family thinks you're still one of them.
2041760	2043320	They might still think I'm one of them.
2043520	2048000	And that's thing is neither of us killed Stan Manstein.
2048400	2052680	No, I'm out of failed my mission of bringing Stan back, but I didn't kill him.
2052680	2056560	So I may, I wouldn't have to infiltrate the glass building.
2056560	2061560	I could just go in maybe under the guise of bringing the guy that killed Stan
2061840	2065240	Manstein in, and then we can, we're all three in there.
2065240	2068680	And if shit goes awry, then we can, uh, I liked that a lot.
2068720	2070760	You're going to use Clark Bishop as your Chewbacca.
2070800	2072080	Yeah, absolutely.
2072120	2077120	This is the man who killed Stan Manstein and we brought him and then we use him
2077680	2079200	to kill Marvin glass.
2079200	2080040	I like that.
2080240	2081800	I mean, fuck Marvin glass.
2081800	2086160	And I think I'm on board for this plan, but just for the record, I don't know if
2086160	2087200	we killed Stan.
2087240	2088640	Well, he's not here.
2088680	2091640	I don't know that he died, but he blipped out of existence.
2091640	2092080	Keith.
2092120	2097120	My task was to bring him back and that is seems like an impossible task.
2097320	2099080	Now it seems like I failed to do that.
2099080	2103040	So yeah, we'll just tell Marvin glass that you're the man who killed Stan
2103040	2103680	Manstein.
2103720	2108280	I think before we do this though, I would like to call the, uh, quote,
2108280	2112560	unquote FBI people back and just see what, see what they say.
2113200	2118440	Cause if you're talking about case cell, was that an FBI thing or do you know
2118440	2119360	what that means?
2119560	2121320	No, man, that was an FBI.
2121440	2124600	Well, maybe these, maybe these people know what the case cell is.
2124600	2127240	Maybe they're somehow affiliated with that.
2127280	2129000	Do we know who the case will work for?
2129040	2130080	It sounds like the case.
2130080	2133640	So was doing the same kind of stuff we were doing, right?
2133960	2138320	Except maybe they were more, I mean, prepared for it than we were.
2138400	2142200	And if these FBI guys are at the end of the day, we're still contention
2142200	2143240	police officers.
2143240	2148080	We're not, well, we're, I mean, maybe not anymore, but what do you think
2148080	2149440	about just giving them a call?
2149520	2150760	We don't have to meet up with them.
2150800	2153800	We don't have to tell them everything we know, but I'd like to see what they
2153800	2155360	think when we call them back.
2155400	2159200	Cause I think they're the ones that really made us knowledgeable about the
2159200	2161080	weird shit that's going down.
2161120	2163240	I mean, we saw it with our own eyes, but they're the ones that
2163240	2164560	confirmed that it's happening.
2164680	2167240	They're the ones who confirmed that somebody else knew about it.
2167400	2169680	I don't see that they've helped us a damn at all.
2170120	2171680	Well, they gave us the bag.
2171720	2173240	I don't know if it helped.
2173320	2175480	I mean, we could be helping them inadvertently, but you're right.
2175520	2176600	I mean, or I'm right.
2176920	2180640	It seemed like they were at least offering the branch to help ourselves.
2180640	2182200	What is the harm in calling them?
2182200	2185080	And if we feel like we can't trust them, we just go about our business.
2185080	2188360	We don't fuck with them, but I don't, I don't think there is a harm in calling
2188360	2192880	them, but they might break some of the element of surprise if we, if we're
2192880	2196880	trying to do a, a Darren raid on Marvin glasses, we don't have to tell them that
2196880	2200600	we're doing that we need, I'm saying just get in contact with them, see what they
2200600	2202360	have to offer and we go from there.
2202400	2204080	We'll have to put on objection to that.
2204120	2207480	We'll have to, yeah, we'll just have to put on our acting pants and make sure
2207480	2212000	that they don't know that we know things about them that you were in
2212000	2213000	theater in high school.
2213000	2217400	I remember, I think maybe you should be the one to field the call.
2218040	2219280	Oh no.
2219960	2222480	Whoever has the highest alertness.
2222520	2225160	I need you to roll alertness for me.
2225160	2226680	Read, read them off guys.
2227720	2228640	A couple of tins.
2228720	2229040	I'm sorry.
2229040	2229200	What?
2229200	2230640	Who has the highest alertness?
2230640	2231440	A 70.
2231520	2232240	Ooh.
2232320	2235440	All right, Joe, go ahead and roll alertness for me.
2237480	2241080	That's an 89.
2241080	2247000	89 continued speaking to your fellow police officers, whips his head
2247000	2248520	around every direction he can.
2250720	2252280	Clark does no such thing.
2254720	2258680	Uh, yeah, so we call, we call the FBI and we just see what they know.
2258760	2263520	I mean the, uh, the in heavy air quotes, FBI, I have to say we give them a little
2263520	2267240	bit of info, but we by no means tell them everything we know.
2267280	2268800	Well, let's run that down real quick.
2268800	2270200	Like what do we, what do we want?
2270240	2273280	So we're going to be calling them and telling them that we failed.
2273320	2276600	We, I mean, 48 hours has passed and we haven't neutralized the threat.
2276600	2277960	Is that what we should lead with?
2277960	2279000	Or I think so.
2279000	2283360	And then maybe though, well, maybe, or maybe we, you know, we
2283360	2284920	found the threat was much bigger.
2285080	2286040	I mean, both.
2286080	2286440	Yeah.
2286520	2286920	Yeah.
2287000	2289920	Or, yeah, it was something that there's no way we could have tackled
2289920	2292160	in 48 hours had even if we'd known.
2292200	2295680	I mean, that's why there's, that's why they said if you finish it in 48 hours,
2296080	2296560	good.
2296560	2297640	Otherwise call us.
2297680	2301480	Well, they might even still think that we're in contention dealing with that.
2301520	2305200	Cause I think we've moved on to bigger things outside of contention.
2305200	2307760	We can pretend to be still in contention when we call them.
2308080	2309520	I don't know if that'll do us any good.
2309560	2311720	I think we should just be straight forward with these people.
2311720	2314480	I don't know who the fuck they are, but they're not Marvin glass.
2314480	2317240	So I think they're probably better than what we're dealing with right now.
2317280	2318240	We're just, that's the thing.
2318240	2319880	We're hoping they're not Marvin glass.
2320040	2325560	I say we, I say we feed them one, one major line instead of all the details
2325560	2327920	and then see what their reaction is to it.
2328040	2330040	What is the major thing we talked to him about that?
2330040	2332920	Well, we'll have to, yeah, we'll conduct the conversation with.
2333920	2335360	Suave and effortless.
2335520	2340000	Yeah, but what's the, what are we going to tell him?
2340040	2342720	We'll say like, we got that fool Marvin glass.
2342760	2344000	How do you feel about that?
2345200	2346320	Let's see how they react.
2347120	2350720	And then when they react appropriately, then we tell them we're lying.
2350760	2351240	Sorry.
2351240	2354080	No, actually we don't have them, but we could really use your help.
2354080	2357120	Well, if they're working for glass, they would know we don't have glass,
2357120	2358600	but I get the, I get what you mean.
2361840	2368720	You hear this absurd scream coming from on top of one of the crypts that is
2368720	2374160	nearby and surrounding you and looking over, you see this massive creature
2374360	2377200	begin to materialize in front of you.
2377560	2383800	And it is a six and a half to seven feet tall creature with long limbs.
2383840	2389840	And it is gaunt and it has translucent skin and it is wearing a black suit.
2389880	2397000	And it looks at Clark Bishop in the eyes and it says, hello, subject one,
2397000	2402440	five, two, two, five, one, eight, one, nine, five, five, one, eight,
2402680	2406480	please hand me the book, please.
2413800	2443120	How am I the only one trying to fool or how can I have enough
2443120	2443840	trow?
