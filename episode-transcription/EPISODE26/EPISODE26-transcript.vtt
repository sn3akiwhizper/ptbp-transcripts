Hello, garbage people. It's your trash truck driver, Wolf the Dog.

00:04.560 --> 00:11.260
And this junkyard dog is here to dump some non-biodegradable news in your mine's landfills.

00:11.260 --> 00:16.260
We are coming at you live from the most delicious trash-filled radio station,

00:16.260 --> 00:21.380
Contentions' own 694.2 PTBP.

00:21.380 --> 00:28.040
Remember, leave those trash cans open for your old buddy Wolf, so I can get me a late-night snack.

00:28.040 --> 00:31.120
Hope y'all threw something tasty away.

00:31.120 --> 00:36.240
What am I even saying? It's all tasty to me, my babies.

00:36.240 --> 00:39.640
Mmmmmm.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.840
We got us a new Howlin' with Wolf entry that comes from

00:42.840 --> 00:46.480
at Unclear Gamer on Twitter.

00:46.480 --> 00:50.000
They tweeted about the show and tagged at PretendingPod.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.520

At Unclear Gamer writes,

01:08.080 --> 01:10.600
Title, Trouble on the Force.

01:10.600 --> 01:11.600
Dear Wolf,

01:11.600 --> 01:16.160
After the absolute mess my other officers have made of Condention PD,

01:16.160 --> 01:20.560
I have decided to leave my post here and move to the city PD.

01:20.600 --> 01:26.880
A lovely woman has replaced me, and she seems blissfully unaware of the wreck she is about to walk into.

01:26.880 --> 01:33.120
How can I warn her of her current predicament without shit-talking my former co-workers too much?

01:33.120 --> 01:39.880
Thanks, Officer Lauren, which is poorly crossed out, followed by Disgruntled Deputy.

01:39.880 --> 01:42.480
Listeners, this is some real spooky shit.

01:42.480 --> 01:45.480
I've never heard of an officer in Contention named Lauren.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.680
But you know, I went back and listened to some of our programming,

01:48.680 --> 01:54.680
and I found a clip of myself, Wolf the Dog, talking about Officer Lauren.

01:54.680 --> 01:59.280
What the extra-dimensional fuck is going on around here, y'all?

01:59.280 --> 02:04.120
When it comes to advice about the Contention Police Force, I suggest a wide berth.

02:04.120 --> 02:10.680
Those boys' minds and moods change about as quickly and as often as my entire reality.

02:10.680 --> 02:16.480
Speaking of an unstable existence, it's time for the news.

02:16.480 --> 02:22.480
The officers use the radio to put Doug Jacobs in the body of Agent Trent Chad,

02:22.480 --> 02:25.800
relegating Agent Chad to a cat body.

02:25.800 --> 02:29.960
Rosemary, one of the Glass Crime family bruisers,

02:29.960 --> 02:34.840
grabbed a briefcase out of Drew's trunk she claimed has $5 million in it.

02:34.840 --> 02:42.160
She was adamant about getting her hands on the gun the officers first found in the possession of Tildy B. Mitchell.

02:42.160 --> 02:46.800
Doug saw the ooze inside the police station and everyone freaked out,

02:46.800 --> 02:52.000
busting pipes and spraying water everywhere, effectively flooding the station.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.600
Doug really lost it when he exclaimed that the water wasn't stopping the oily goop.

02:57.600 --> 03:02.320
Jan Manstein, the grieving mother of Ari Manstein,

03:02.320 --> 03:06.520
the Contention officer tragically killed in the fire at the city hospital,

03:06.520 --> 03:12.360
came by to pick up Ari's things and asked the officers to relay the news to Ari's father Stan,

03:12.360 --> 03:16.080
who has been in the city asylum for the past 20 years.

03:16.080 --> 03:20.440
Wolf the dog would acquiesce to being locked up in a sanatorium,

03:20.440 --> 03:27.720
as long as I can always listen to kudzu with no backbone.

03:36.520 --> 03:50.720
I didn't know it could... I was hunting a female and then this buck just came out of the fucking...

03:50.720 --> 03:56.560
A doe. A deer. A female deer. Ray. A drop of golden sun.

03:56.560 --> 03:59.280
I hope we're not recording so there's not just an audio of me going,

03:59.280 --> 04:03.600
I was hunting a female. There is now.

04:04.600 --> 04:09.120
But yeah, the buck just came out of the bushes right here and knocked me on my ass.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.840
I got killed by a dog today.

04:10.840 --> 04:14.440
Oh yeah, he got torn apart by an Australian Shepherd.

04:14.440 --> 04:19.200
Because I rode it onto this guy's farm. I was shooting birds out of the sky

04:19.200 --> 04:24.000
and just accidentally wandered onto this guy's farm and he came up to me and started shooting me.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.720
I thought he was a bounty hunter or something so I killed him and then all the other farmhands were witnesses

04:28.720 --> 04:32.520
so I had to kill them and then the dog came and comes up.

04:32.600 --> 04:36.760
So I was like, oh, okay, and I got off my horse and I didn't want to shoot the dog.

04:36.760 --> 04:40.720
So yeah, it chased me and then just like ripped my throat out.

04:40.720 --> 04:43.680
Holy shit. Do you find yourself dying a lot?

04:43.680 --> 04:48.560
Yeah, I try not to as much as... like not as much anymore.

04:48.560 --> 04:52.760
Like I've really tried... I try to be a lot more careful now and I try not to get bounties and shit.

04:52.760 --> 04:56.240
I found that if I get jumped, if I get... if like there's a few random encounters

04:56.240 --> 04:58.600
where like a cart will pull in front of you and then he's like, get them boys!

04:58.600 --> 05:01.440
And it's like five guys come at me and almost every time I die to them.

05:01.440 --> 05:06.920
Yeah, bounty hunters almost like... it seems like every time I'm fighting bounty hunters

05:06.920 --> 05:11.600
I get to like the last one and I miss and he shoots me dead.

05:11.600 --> 05:15.520
Oh, they finally... they released the Call of Cthulhu game.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.080
Yeah, I was watching the guy stream it a little bit today.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.880
Was it the one that we watched the...

05:18.880 --> 05:21.000
No, it was a different one than that trailer.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.200
Have you read the reviews?

05:22.200 --> 05:27.560
So the first review I read basically started with, what the fuck?

05:29.040 --> 05:29.880
In a bad way?

05:29.880 --> 05:33.720
Yeah, apparently it's cool. Like it's a very cool game.

05:33.720 --> 05:38.000
Reddit always... on the Reddit games, they always aggregate all the scores in a thread

05:38.000 --> 05:40.840
and it was sixes and sevens the entire way through.

05:40.840 --> 05:46.480
Yeah, so apparently the game is cool. However, it took them years to put this together.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.840
Yeah, and it is eight hours of gameplay.

05:49.840 --> 05:54.440
Yeah, and I think that's generous. Yeah, the thing I saw said six to seven.

05:54.440 --> 05:55.480
What do you do in it?

05:55.480 --> 05:57.520
Holy shit, that's dumb.

05:57.760 --> 06:01.680
But, all that being said, the comments on that Reddit thread were like,

06:01.680 --> 06:04.160
for what it's worth, I've played about four hours and I'm loving it.

06:04.160 --> 06:07.320
Like it's apparently a lot of fun being Cthulhu-y.

06:07.320 --> 06:13.240
And I love it, not being a gamer, that I can sit down with that game and play it in a day.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.240
Yeah, right, sure.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.080
That's actually a plus for me.

06:16.080 --> 06:19.800
Call of Cthulhu is the rare bad game that's still worth playing.

06:21.160 --> 06:23.440
Hell yeah, just like this campaign.

06:23.440 --> 06:24.120
Hell yeah.

06:25.120 --> 06:34.560
So, I wanted to talk a little bit at the top about sanity loss and rolling for sanity.

06:34.560 --> 06:40.360
The example I'm going to use is, you guys saw the security footage of Dr. Marie Jacobs

06:40.360 --> 06:45.480
and the body of Doug Jacobs get smashed in the ground and I asked you to roll sanity

06:45.480 --> 06:50.480
and you said, but we've already seen that, why would that affect us?

06:51.440 --> 06:54.160
But I was thinking about it and I was like, well maybe not,

06:54.160 --> 06:57.040
like it would affect you still, but less so.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.680
I like, yeah, I agree, because that's a fucked up thing to see.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.280
Exactly, it's a super fucked up thing and I was thinking about it,

07:02.280 --> 07:05.040
I was like, okay, so if you pass the sanity loss,

07:05.040 --> 07:09.280
A, it's on security footage, you can think whatever you want to think about

07:09.280 --> 07:14.000
that being tampered with or whatever, but if you lose on the sanity check,

07:14.000 --> 07:17.320
A, it happened somewhere new, it happened in the police station,

07:17.320 --> 07:20.200
you didn't know it could happen in the police, you just may have thought that it was...

07:20.920 --> 07:25.120
Exactly, or also you realized that last time was real,

07:25.120 --> 07:30.520
like you now have proof on footage of what you saw

07:30.520 --> 07:33.520
and were probably trying to convince yourself it wasn't real.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.600
I don't know about you guys, you guys are pretty dead set on just like...

07:36.600 --> 07:39.200
I hope we see it again, I hope we see it again.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.360
Yeah, so we're not going to retcon any sand loss.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.360
Cool, because I ain't got much.

07:43.360 --> 07:48.360
But in the future, let's try to like come up with reasons why the sand loss happened,

07:48.400 --> 07:54.040
like why the fail is more interesting or different than a success on a sanity check.

07:54.040 --> 07:58.680
Hey, can the next campaign be set like 20 years in the future and I'll be Rosemary's baby?

07:59.680 --> 08:03.400
What about way in the future and it's Rosemary's granddaughter,

08:03.400 --> 08:07.400
spitting image of my father, you know that old song?

08:07.400 --> 08:08.520
Yeah, what is that song?

08:08.520 --> 08:11.400
Jessica Andrews called Who I Am.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.600
I think I had a crush on her, is she super pretty?

08:13.600 --> 08:14.920
Uh, we're about to find out.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.560
Who I Am!

08:17.560 --> 08:21.560
Rock me like a hurricane!

08:21.560 --> 08:22.560
Yeah!

08:22.560 --> 08:23.560
Oh!

08:23.560 --> 08:28.560
As you head toward the highway, you notice what Drew mentioned in his phone call.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.560
A severe lack of traffic.

08:30.560 --> 08:35.560
It's 9am, but the dearth of other cars on the roads is reminiscent of 4am.

08:35.560 --> 08:39.560
Sitting at a red light with no one in sight, the feeling is amplified.

08:39.560 --> 08:45.560
The turning weather must have pushed much of the population in contention to stay cozied up at home.

08:45.560 --> 08:49.560
The beggars on the corners of the intersections, the runners on their morning route,

08:49.560 --> 08:54.560
the loitering teenagers on pot, they were all just not around.

08:54.560 --> 09:00.560
The protesters, so riled up and determined, have dispersed and are nowhere to be seen.

09:00.560 --> 09:08.560
You can vaguely hear the sounds of other cars' life in contention over a heartbreaking, steady roar.

09:08.560 --> 09:14.560
It would be so weirdly quiet if it weren't for the many animals still cohabiting in the ponds and creeks.

09:14.560 --> 09:19.560
There are fewer than there were even yesterday, but the ones left are growing more vocal,

09:19.560 --> 09:23.560
with the cold and lack of food seemingly abandoned by their owners.

09:23.560 --> 09:27.560
You pull onto the highway, heading for the city with the sun at your back,

09:27.560 --> 09:34.560
in whichever cars and bringing whichever stuff we decide during this next conversation.

09:34.560 --> 09:40.560
Oh, well we had all the cars and all the stuff, including some stuff we didn't have before.

09:40.560 --> 09:41.560
We took three semis.

09:41.560 --> 09:43.560
We found it on the lookout.

09:43.560 --> 09:47.560
We've got the whole Fast and Furious crew backing us up.

09:53.560 --> 09:59.560
Maybe Glass's crew is pretty good with cars.

09:59.560 --> 10:00.560
We'll find out.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.560
Maybe they are.

10:04.560 --> 10:07.560
Maybe one of them is named Vince.

10:07.560 --> 10:10.560
I'm going all original and only the friends.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.560
Vince Petrol.

10:13.560 --> 10:14.560
What are we doing?

10:14.560 --> 10:18.560
Well, before we leave town, well, while we're leaving town, I guess, I kind of want to call.

10:18.560 --> 10:23.560
Phone calls is what I was thinking for the hour that you have in the cars on the way to the city.

10:23.560 --> 10:24.560
Tight.

10:24.560 --> 10:25.560
So, what are you driving?

10:25.560 --> 10:27.560
How are you getting to the city?

10:27.560 --> 10:28.560
Who's in what cars?

10:28.560 --> 10:29.560
Five of us?

10:29.560 --> 10:30.560
Does Rosemary have a car?

10:30.560 --> 10:33.560
She does have a car in contention.

10:33.560 --> 10:38.560
However, the three of you drove to the police station in Drew's Mini Cooper.

10:38.560 --> 10:39.560
Okay.

10:39.560 --> 10:44.560
Maybe we should make Rosemary drive to the city in her own car if she'll accept that.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.560
And then we can take two cruisers or one cruiser.

10:47.560 --> 10:49.560
Let's take one cruiser and then we can play 20 questions.

10:49.560 --> 10:50.560
Yeah.

10:50.560 --> 10:51.560
I like that idea.

10:51.560 --> 10:52.560
Whereas two cruisers is better.

10:52.560 --> 10:55.560
I just feel like two would give us some options.

10:55.560 --> 11:01.560
We could always steal someone's car, like hijack a car, once we get there if we need it.

11:01.560 --> 11:03.560
My cruiser is not at the station.

11:03.560 --> 11:04.560
It's okay.

11:04.560 --> 11:08.560
We're police from a very small town an hour and a half away.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.560
I think my cruiser is there, right?

11:10.560 --> 11:11.560
It is.

11:11.560 --> 11:12.560
Is my cruiser there?

11:12.560 --> 11:13.560
No.

11:13.560 --> 11:14.560
We can take my cruiser.

11:14.560 --> 11:17.560
I believe your cruisers are both in the impound lot.

11:17.560 --> 11:18.560
They're totaled.

11:18.560 --> 11:19.560
Yeah.

11:19.560 --> 11:21.560
I guess we're taking one cruiser.

11:21.560 --> 11:22.560
Cool.

11:22.560 --> 11:23.560
Is mine totaled?

11:23.560 --> 11:24.560
I thought I just left it at home from last night.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.560
Was yours involved in the wreck at all?

11:26.560 --> 11:27.560
I don't remember.

11:27.560 --> 11:29.560
Mine got crushed by John Peters.

11:29.560 --> 11:31.560
I did run into the back of his car, didn't I?

11:31.560 --> 11:32.560
Yes.

11:32.560 --> 11:33.560
Both of your cars were totaled in that wreck.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.560
You're right.

11:34.560 --> 11:35.560
How did I get home last night?

11:35.560 --> 11:36.560
I guess you took me.

11:36.560 --> 11:37.560
Probably.

11:37.560 --> 11:40.560
For a long couple of days.

11:40.560 --> 11:41.560
Yes.

11:41.560 --> 11:45.560
I guess, realistically, we would only be taking yours.

11:45.560 --> 11:46.560
Okay.

11:46.560 --> 11:53.560
So, the three of you in the body of Agent Trent Chad, Agent Chad Trent, Agent Chad,

11:53.560 --> 11:55.560
Agent Trent Chad.

11:55.560 --> 11:56.560
You got it?

11:56.560 --> 12:01.560
Are in the cruiser, and you have Rosemary driving her own car behind you?

12:01.560 --> 12:04.560
We'll probably follow her, yeah, because we don't really know where we're going.

12:04.560 --> 12:05.560
You know what?

12:05.560 --> 12:06.560
That makes even more sense.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.560
Hey, just follow us to your gang's hideout.

12:08.560 --> 12:09.560
Okay.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.560
What should we bring with us?

12:11.560 --> 12:12.560
Weapons?

12:12.560 --> 12:13.560
We've got all the weapons.

12:13.560 --> 12:14.560
Yeah, my trunk's full of weapons.

12:14.560 --> 12:18.560
So, you stop by Clark's house and pick up some heavy weaponry.

12:18.560 --> 12:19.560
Hey, don't go inside.

12:19.560 --> 12:21.560
What did we find at the robot house?

12:21.560 --> 12:23.560
We found some cool weapons there, right?

12:23.560 --> 12:24.560
Oh.

12:24.560 --> 12:25.560
I had a list of them.

12:25.560 --> 12:27.560
We had a sniper rifle that we gave to the old man.

12:27.560 --> 12:28.560
Oh, I forgot about that sniper.

12:28.560 --> 12:30.560
Yeah, wasn't there something else cool there?

12:30.560 --> 12:33.560
There were machine guns, too, I think, or assault rifles.

12:33.560 --> 12:34.560
Assault.

12:34.560 --> 12:36.560
Did we find those after our fight with the giant?

12:36.560 --> 12:39.560
No, because we gave the sniper to the dude while it was happening.

12:39.560 --> 12:40.560
Yeah.

12:40.560 --> 12:47.560
So, in the wooden crates marked US military that are now hidden in Clark Bishop's garage.

12:47.560 --> 12:48.560
Garage?

12:48.560 --> 12:55.560
Those crates included pistol, shotguns, rifles, a shoulder-mounted anti-aircraft weapon, an

12:55.560 --> 13:02.560
EMP rifle, a grappling gun, a small gun that shoots tracers, lots of grenades, a sniper

13:02.560 --> 13:06.560
rifle, a very, very tiny but powerful gun.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.560
We load all of that into the truck.

13:08.560 --> 13:09.560
Should we take it all?

13:09.560 --> 13:12.560
Real quick, what is Clark's garage like?

13:12.560 --> 13:13.560
Very clean.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.560
Very clean.

13:14.560 --> 13:21.560
Got a tool bench over on the side there with a lot of tools all hung in their places.

13:21.560 --> 13:22.560
Everything.

13:22.560 --> 13:28.560
And then these weapons are all just kind of haphazardly in a corner.

13:28.560 --> 13:31.560
That one gun that you said shoots tracers, we clarify that you meant that they shot tracking

13:31.560 --> 13:33.560
things, is that right?

13:33.560 --> 13:34.560
Yeah.

13:34.560 --> 13:35.560
Like a home-in device?

13:35.560 --> 13:36.560
Like a GPS?

13:36.560 --> 13:37.560
Like a GPS.

13:37.560 --> 13:38.560
Oh, cool.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.560
Should we take all this stuff?

13:40.560 --> 13:41.560
I don't see why not.

13:41.560 --> 13:44.560
I think we should take the EMP gun for sure since we fought a robot recently.

13:44.560 --> 13:45.560
Yep.

13:45.560 --> 13:47.560
And I think we should take those tracers since we'll be messing with the mob.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.560
We might need to make sure we know where somebody goes.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.560
I'd like the anti-aircraft gun too.

13:52.560 --> 13:55.560
Yeah, in case of an emergency.

13:55.560 --> 13:58.560
And the grappling gun because then we can climb stuff.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.560
And all the grenades just in case.

14:00.560 --> 14:05.560
I want to take my small but very powerful pistol as well.

14:05.560 --> 14:06.560
Sniper too?

14:06.560 --> 14:07.560
Oh yeah.

14:07.560 --> 14:10.560
So yeah, let's pretty much take it all.

14:10.560 --> 14:13.560
I'll take an assault rifle for myself as well.

14:13.560 --> 14:15.560
And a shotgun.

14:15.560 --> 14:17.560
Clark wants an assault rifle.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.560
I think we all got our assault rifles.

14:19.560 --> 14:20.560
Yeah.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.560
And I got a pretty big trunk so we can fit it all back here.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.560
Okay, that all sounds good.

14:25.560 --> 14:35.560
And you also have at James the mill worker's house there was also a stash of weapons there.

14:35.560 --> 14:36.560
Good ones?

14:36.560 --> 14:37.560
Yeah, I don't remember what was there.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.560
That's the house we're talking about, right?

14:39.560 --> 14:44.560
Well no, so the military crates were from the storage units.

14:44.560 --> 14:45.560
Oh, okay.

14:45.560 --> 14:47.560
That's what I was talking about the one and what did we find there?

14:47.560 --> 14:56.560
There you just found a bunch of pistols, silencers, shotguns, an assault rifle, and a sniper.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.560
And body armor.

14:57.560 --> 14:58.560
Oh, yeah.

14:58.560 --> 14:59.560
Who has the body armor?

14:59.560 --> 15:00.560
Was there more than one set?

15:00.560 --> 15:01.560
You could each have body armor.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.560
Let's strap one body armor please.

15:03.560 --> 15:04.560
Yeah, one body armor.

15:04.560 --> 15:05.560
Hey, you want to take it now?

15:05.560 --> 15:07.560
Strap it on big boy.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.560
Okay, so you strapped it on big boy.

15:09.560 --> 15:14.560
And I think we are good to go.

15:14.560 --> 15:21.560
You're going to have to take Rosemary in the cruiser with you to John's house to get her car.

15:21.560 --> 15:22.560
Sure.

15:22.560 --> 15:29.560
And so you pull up to the turn for John's house where you would then have to go down his long gravel driveway.

15:29.560 --> 15:34.560
And sitting by the road is Rosemary's car and she'll get out.

15:34.560 --> 15:35.560
Who has the best drive?

15:35.560 --> 15:37.560
I believe it's John.

15:37.560 --> 15:38.560
Yeah, you should be driving.

15:38.560 --> 15:41.560
I was a professional waste car driver briefly.

15:41.560 --> 15:46.560
Real fast, does that body armor have anything mechanically that we add to anything for us?

15:46.560 --> 15:48.560
Yeah.

15:48.560 --> 15:49.560
Cool.

15:49.560 --> 15:51.560
I guess we'll find out.

15:51.560 --> 15:53.560
Does it give you willpower points?

15:53.560 --> 15:55.560
So I still have a negative 20 if I'm at two?

15:55.560 --> 15:56.560
Yes.

15:56.560 --> 15:57.560
Do we have any?

15:57.560 --> 15:58.560
I want to bring cocaine with us.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.560
Yeah, we got a little bit.

16:00.560 --> 16:05.560
Yeah, I want to have a little baggie of coke on me to, you know, get through the day.

16:05.560 --> 16:10.560
I don't want to do it yet since we're not really going to be rolling for, well, I don't know that.

16:10.560 --> 16:14.560
Can I sleep in the car on the way to the city and regain willpower?

16:14.560 --> 16:16.560
No, it's just an hour drive to the city.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.560
There's no power nap mechanic?

16:18.560 --> 16:21.560
My reasoning is that there's no power nap mechanic.

16:21.560 --> 16:23.560
Thank you, Thomas.

16:23.560 --> 16:33.560
And you can write down for your tactical body armor, you are going to have a five hit point buffer.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.560
Tight.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.560
What does that mean exactly?

16:35.560 --> 16:40.560
I'm writing plus five next to my current hit points and I'll take from there as I get hit.

16:40.560 --> 16:41.560
Sounds good to me.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.560
That gets me all the way up to 13.

16:43.560 --> 16:47.560
Real hustlers don't sleep, we take naps.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.560
Okay, so you guys are in the car.

16:49.560 --> 16:52.560
Yeah, I want to call, fuck, what are their names?

16:52.560 --> 16:54.560
The Glass Brothers.

16:54.560 --> 17:00.560
No, our bros, they own the Daily Fuh and the Skeeters, or Clinkers.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.560
I want to call Gary.

17:02.560 --> 17:03.560
Gary, is it?

17:03.560 --> 17:04.560
Harry and Gary.

17:04.560 --> 17:05.560
Harry and Gary.

17:05.560 --> 17:06.560
Harry and Gary.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.560
Harry Clinker and Gary Daily.

17:08.560 --> 17:12.560
Okay, yeah, I want to call Harry Clinker.

17:12.560 --> 17:16.560
He's got an old fashioned phone.

17:16.560 --> 17:19.560
I have a quick question for you.

17:19.560 --> 17:22.560
Did you take the cell phone jammer with you that you found?

17:22.560 --> 17:23.560
Yes, of course.

17:23.560 --> 17:24.560
But we didn't turn it on.

17:24.560 --> 17:25.560
See, it was already-

17:25.560 --> 17:26.560
No, we didn't take it.

17:26.560 --> 17:27.560
Turned on.

17:27.560 --> 17:33.560
Okay, we turned it off.

17:33.560 --> 17:36.560
Wait, where did we get a cell phone jammer?

17:36.560 --> 17:38.560
It was in Chad's briefcase.

17:38.560 --> 17:39.560
Oh, yeah.

17:39.560 --> 17:40.560
I forgot about it.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.560
What else was in his briefcase?

17:41.560 --> 17:42.560
Was there anything else important?

17:42.560 --> 17:43.560
It was the stuff on the table.

17:43.560 --> 17:45.560
It's the map in front of you.

17:45.560 --> 17:46.560
Oh, right, right, right.

17:46.560 --> 17:47.560
And the list of-

17:47.560 --> 17:48.560
Places.

17:48.560 --> 17:49.560
Places in contention.

17:49.560 --> 17:50.560
Cool.

17:50.560 --> 17:52.560
Yeah, let's turn that cell phone jammer off.

17:52.560 --> 17:55.560
See how many missed calls we have.

17:55.560 --> 18:01.560
Okay, so you turn it off and then you call Harry Clinker.

18:01.560 --> 18:05.560
And as you make this phone call, Luke, Keith's phone starts to buzz.

18:05.560 --> 18:06.560
I answer it.

18:06.560 --> 18:10.560
It is a couple voicemails and a text.

18:10.560 --> 18:15.560
And let's cut to the phone call with John Pettymore and Harry Clinker.

18:15.560 --> 18:16.560
Bring, bring.

18:16.560 --> 18:17.560
Bring, bring.

18:17.560 --> 18:18.560
Hey.

18:18.560 --> 18:19.560
Hey, Harry.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.560
How you doing today?

18:21.560 --> 18:22.560
Slow day.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.560
Well, I can imagine.

18:24.560 --> 18:27.560
Do you know where all the people went?

18:27.560 --> 18:30.560
Yeah, we've been talking about that.

18:30.560 --> 18:33.560
Yeah, you know, it's crazy.

18:33.560 --> 18:38.560
It's just like maybe it got cold and everybody went on holiday and people can't take the

18:38.560 --> 18:39.560
cold anymore.

18:39.560 --> 18:45.560
Well, sure, of course everybody leaves contention in mass droves once a year when it gets cold,

18:45.560 --> 18:48.560
but usually that's mid-January after the holidays have died down.

18:48.560 --> 18:52.560
Yeah, it's almost like everybody went a month early.

18:52.560 --> 18:56.560
I don't find that to be a very satisfactory conclusion.

18:56.560 --> 18:57.560
Oh, same.

18:57.560 --> 18:59.560
You got any other working theories?

18:59.560 --> 19:07.560
Well, you know, it could be a gang of disease, you know, it could be a gang disease or, you

19:07.560 --> 19:09.560
know, it, I don't know.

19:09.560 --> 19:13.560
To be honest, buddy, I was kind of hoping maybe you told people to get out of town.

19:13.560 --> 19:23.560
Well, no, I was trying to get people to come down to Clinker's and have a Bud Light.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.560
That sounds pretty good right about now, Harry.

19:25.560 --> 19:26.560
Doesn't it?

19:26.560 --> 19:27.560
Come on down.

19:27.560 --> 19:28.560
We'll serve you up real good.

19:28.560 --> 19:29.560
Is that Harry?

19:29.560 --> 19:30.560
Is that him?

19:30.560 --> 19:31.560
That's Harry.

19:31.560 --> 19:32.560
Tell him I said hey.

19:32.560 --> 19:33.560
Hey, Clark says hi.

19:33.560 --> 19:35.560
Hey, tell Clark I, yeah, nice.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.560
Does he say hi back?

19:37.560 --> 19:39.560
Clark, yeah, he said nice.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.560
Ah, I love Harry.

19:41.560 --> 19:43.560
Yeah, he's a good guy.

19:43.560 --> 19:45.560
Thank you.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.560
What have you guys been doing?

19:47.560 --> 19:54.560
Because I know, you know, a lot of the people around here were giving it to you pretty good

19:54.560 --> 20:00.560
and, you know, I always stood up for you but, again, I keep my head down.

20:00.560 --> 20:02.560
I don't really know what's going on.

20:02.560 --> 20:06.560
Harry, honestly, we're only responsible for two or three of these disappearances.

20:06.560 --> 20:08.560
The rest are not on us.

20:08.560 --> 20:10.560
That's a really low percentage.

20:10.560 --> 20:11.560
Right?

20:11.560 --> 20:12.560
That's what I'm saying.

20:12.560 --> 20:13.560
Those kids, that's bad.

20:13.560 --> 20:14.560
That was, that was me and Clark.

20:14.560 --> 20:15.560
We didn't mean nothing by it.

20:15.560 --> 20:16.560
It was the goo.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.560
I mean, but through our negligence.

20:18.560 --> 20:20.560
I'm hitting John on the shoulder.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.560
No, hey, hi.

20:22.560 --> 20:23.560
Harry, Harry's.

20:23.560 --> 20:24.560
Keith is learning.

20:24.560 --> 20:25.560
Harry's our confidant, I think.

20:25.560 --> 20:27.560
Harry, we fought a robot man.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.560
A guy was eating his own foot.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.560
I'm just giving wide eyes to John.

20:32.560 --> 20:35.560
Who else is giving wide eyes to John?

20:35.560 --> 20:39.560
Oh, it's Doug in the agent's body staring at John Lee anymore.

20:39.560 --> 20:45.560
Yeah, I mean, on top of that, we put a man in a cat's body and then, no, we took a man

20:45.560 --> 20:49.560
out of a cat's body into another man's body and put that man into a cat.

20:50.560 --> 20:51.560
And look at Chad.

20:51.560 --> 20:53.560
I'm like, this is how he and Harry talk.

20:53.560 --> 20:54.560
It's just jokes.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.560
They, it's one of their things.

20:56.560 --> 20:59.560
Yeah, this is a long running bit, Chad.

20:59.560 --> 21:00.560
Don't worry about it.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.560
Chad knows that he is in a different.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.560
What have you been up to?

21:04.560 --> 21:05.560
Oh, wow.

21:05.560 --> 21:06.560
Anything?

21:06.560 --> 21:12.560
Well, I mean, just on all that, you know, that, John, that, that makes me worry about

21:12.560 --> 21:17.560
you, you know, you know, if you're, if you're seeing all that kind of stuff, you, you may

21:17.560 --> 21:23.560
want to talk to someone, you know, maybe a, you know, not to get too frank, but maybe

21:23.560 --> 21:30.560
a spiritualist of some sort could, could assist you if, if you're dealing with, with people

21:30.560 --> 21:32.560
and other people's bodies and stuff.

21:32.560 --> 21:36.560
If you need a, if you need a medium, you know, you can always talk to Gary.

21:36.560 --> 21:37.560
Yeah.

21:37.560 --> 21:38.560
Is he around?

21:38.560 --> 21:41.560
Well, I haven't seen him actually at all today.

21:41.560 --> 21:44.560
He didn't come home last night, but he's always around.

21:44.560 --> 21:47.560
He's probably just at his restaurant.

21:47.560 --> 21:48.560
Right on.

21:48.560 --> 21:53.560
I mean, well, don't leave plinkers, but you maybe should be concerned.

21:53.560 --> 21:58.560
No, I don't, I don't say that.

21:58.560 --> 22:00.560
Your husband may be dead.

22:00.560 --> 22:04.560
Your husband's probably disappeared to the upside down.

22:04.560 --> 22:07.560
Has Gary been acting weird at all lately?

22:07.560 --> 22:11.560
Well, yeah, but, uh, you know, Gary's, uh, he's a weird bird.

22:11.560 --> 22:12.560
But weirder.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.560
Anything out of, out of the usual?

22:14.560 --> 22:20.560
No, I mean, he's been meeting with his, uh, with his like group more often than usual,

22:20.560 --> 22:21.560
but what group?

22:21.560 --> 22:28.560
Oh, his old group of, uh, you know, spiritualists and, uh, you know, meta metaphysics thinkers.

22:28.560 --> 22:29.560
Right.

22:29.560 --> 22:30.560
Yeah.

22:30.560 --> 22:37.560
Uh, you know, it's, uh, him, uh, Dr. Marie Jacobs, what's a, what's a lady's name?

22:37.560 --> 22:38.560
Mildred Mitchell.

22:38.560 --> 22:43.560
Yeah, the three of them, uh, meet up and talk about their, uh, eccentric books that

22:43.560 --> 22:45.560
they read and such.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.560
Well, that's, that's very good to know, Harry.

22:47.560 --> 22:52.560
Well, he's always been into, you know, the occult and, uh, books of that nature.

22:52.560 --> 22:53.560
Everybody knows that.

22:53.560 --> 22:54.560
Yeah.

22:54.560 --> 22:59.560
I think actually he's, he's who I meant to call, but this has been a good conversation.

22:59.560 --> 23:01.560
It's crazy.

23:02.560 --> 23:03.560
It's crazy.

23:03.560 --> 23:08.560
It's like you ever think about like, maybe if you would've called Gary, you'd be talking

23:08.560 --> 23:14.560
to him right now and, uh, he'd be saying that he hadn't seen me all morning.

23:14.560 --> 23:20.560
Ain't it funny how life is and you'd be learning so many more things and you'd have more things

23:20.560 --> 23:21.560
to go on.

23:21.560 --> 23:22.560
Yeah.

23:22.560 --> 23:23.560
Okay.

23:23.560 --> 23:26.560
Yeah, I get your, I get, I get your point.

23:26.560 --> 23:30.560
I mean, I'm not saying that you can't call Gary, you know, he's a good man to talk to.

23:31.560 --> 23:32.560
I think he could help you.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.560
I think I'm through some of these issues.

23:34.560 --> 23:35.560
I think I'm going to do that.

23:35.560 --> 23:36.560
I'm going to have to let you go.

23:36.560 --> 23:38.560
Oh yeah, no, that's fine.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.560
Uh, God, I'm bored.

23:40.560 --> 23:41.560
All right.

23:41.560 --> 23:49.560
Uh, have fun with your bar with the town to yourself.

23:49.560 --> 23:54.560
It's uh, it's 9am so I guess I shouldn't have expected to be too busy yet.

23:54.560 --> 23:55.560
You never know in contention.

23:55.560 --> 23:56.560
Uh, okay.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.560
Well, I really got to go, Harry.

23:58.560 --> 24:01.560
Yeah, it seems like you're in a rush.

24:01.560 --> 24:02.560
Okay.

24:02.560 --> 24:04.560
You hang up first.

24:04.560 --> 24:10.560
Did you, did you hang up?

24:10.560 --> 24:12.560
Harry?

24:12.560 --> 24:16.560
Harry, you hang up first.

24:16.560 --> 24:17.560
Yeah, all right.

24:17.560 --> 24:19.560
And then he clicks.

24:19.560 --> 24:22.560
Quality role playing.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.560
Harry's a goofball.

24:24.560 --> 24:25.560
All right.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.560
What did my texts say?

24:27.560 --> 24:28.560
Uh, well, it's weird.

24:28.560 --> 24:31.560
You just have a one text that you can read pretty quickly.

24:31.560 --> 24:34.560
Uh, as you open your phone, it just says, I know.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.560
And it's from John Lee Pettymore.

24:36.560 --> 24:37.560
I...

24:37.560 --> 24:43.560
It's four voicemails all from late at night this past evening from John Lee Pettymore.

24:43.560 --> 24:44.560
Oh yeah.

24:44.560 --> 24:47.560
It seems like weeks ago that I made those calls.

24:47.560 --> 24:50.560
Uh, are there voicemails?

24:50.560 --> 24:51.560
There are four voicemails.

24:51.560 --> 24:57.560
I try to like hide my phone so that he doesn't know that I'm looking at him and I play the

24:57.560 --> 24:58.560
first one.

24:58.560 --> 25:02.560
I don't remember at all what I said to you in these voicemails.

25:02.560 --> 25:12.560
I killed your brother.

25:12.560 --> 25:15.560
He was a has bean.

25:15.560 --> 25:16.560
God damn it.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.560
Did you come up with a list?

25:18.560 --> 25:26.560
Um, Keith, when you listen to the voicemails, Keith, it's John Lee Pettymore.

25:26.560 --> 25:31.560
I got $5 million now, motherfucker, and I'm going to kick your ass.

25:31.560 --> 25:35.560
Stupid piece of shit messing with my smokey DVDs.

25:35.560 --> 25:37.560
You got damn bandit.

25:37.560 --> 25:39.560
I'm the richest man in the world.

25:39.560 --> 25:43.560
I'm going to stick a boot up your ass and then I'm going to fucking marry the turd that

25:43.560 --> 25:47.560
comes out of that ass.

25:47.560 --> 25:48.560
I put my phone away.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.560
Get some text messages there, buddy.

25:50.560 --> 25:51.560
Oh, just one.

25:51.560 --> 25:52.560
Not important.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.560
Let's focus on the matter at hand.

25:54.560 --> 25:55.560
Guys, I'm sorry.

25:55.560 --> 25:59.560
I know we just got underway, but I got to pee.

25:59.560 --> 26:02.560
Let's not play a gas station.

26:02.560 --> 26:03.560
Okay.

26:03.560 --> 26:04.560
Vroom, vroom.

26:04.560 --> 26:09.560
Basically, do you want to call anybody else on the way to the city?

26:09.560 --> 26:10.560
I guess we should gather information.

26:10.560 --> 26:14.560
We should tell Drew to just keep us posted, send him a text.

26:14.560 --> 26:19.560
Hey buddy, keep, keep an eye on the town for us and let us know what your peepers peep.

26:19.560 --> 26:24.560
If we did need to retcon, now would be the time before we get into the city.

26:24.560 --> 26:26.560
So is there anything we are forgetting to bring with us?

26:26.560 --> 26:27.560
We got weapons.

26:27.560 --> 26:31.560
We got, did we bring the gun?

26:31.560 --> 26:32.560
Retcon.

26:32.560 --> 26:43.560
Oh, it might be way more fun to show up to the city without the gun.

26:44.560 --> 26:49.560
I think we'd have to roll new characters if we walk into Marvin Glass's office without the gun.

26:49.560 --> 26:51.560
I was so excited.

26:51.560 --> 26:53.560
It wouldn't have left your purse in any reason.

26:53.560 --> 26:55.560
We have the gun with us?

26:55.560 --> 26:56.560
Yeah.

26:56.560 --> 26:57.560
Oh, what else?

26:57.560 --> 27:01.560
Is that the only thing with tubes, that you brought object with tubes?

27:01.560 --> 27:03.560
Yeah, I don't think we feel comfortable.

27:03.560 --> 27:08.560
Oh, well actually some of us might've dreamed how to use them.

27:08.560 --> 27:12.560
Oh, I bet maybe let's bring the camera with us.

27:12.560 --> 27:23.560
Oh, fuck.

27:23.560 --> 27:27.560
If people have made it this far in the podcast, they're just like screaming.

27:27.560 --> 27:28.560
Yeah, right.

27:28.560 --> 27:29.560
Dumb motherfuckers.

27:29.560 --> 27:30.560
No joke.

27:30.560 --> 27:34.560
Yeah, well bring the gun and the camera, all the weapons.

27:34.560 --> 27:39.560
There was a thread on the Critical Role subreddit and it was somebody who had posted all the loose ends that they've left.

27:39.560 --> 27:43.560
And it was only like 10 and I was like, oh fuck, if you did that for us.

27:43.560 --> 27:47.560
Everything makes sense.

27:47.560 --> 27:48.560
Oh, I'm sure.

27:48.560 --> 27:49.560
No, I just mean that.

27:49.560 --> 27:58.560
We're not questioning your mystery, we're questioning our mystery tackling abilities.

27:58.560 --> 28:03.560
Our ability to delegate and find conclusion.

28:04.560 --> 28:13.560
I feel like the three of you are jugglers and instead of letting you get good at juggling the balls that you have, I just keep throwing more balls.

28:13.560 --> 28:14.560
That's true.

28:14.560 --> 28:15.560
More balls.

28:15.560 --> 28:20.560
You're the worst audience for a juggler.

28:20.560 --> 28:21.560
So.

28:21.560 --> 28:22.560
Okay.

28:22.560 --> 28:26.560
I don't want to have another 20 minute conversation with Gary.

28:26.560 --> 28:27.560
Why?

28:27.560 --> 28:28.560
No, no, no.

28:28.560 --> 28:32.560
I mean for the listeners.

28:32.560 --> 28:39.560
Okay, most of this episode is just Thomas talking to Zach on an imaginary cell phone.

28:39.560 --> 28:40.560
It's a good one, guys.

28:40.560 --> 28:41.560
Buckle up.

28:41.560 --> 28:44.560
Luke doesn't seem bored at all, so I think we're good.

28:44.560 --> 28:49.560
He's literally cleaning out his ear with a mechanical pencil.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.560
It's fucking nasty, dude.

28:51.560 --> 28:53.560
Yeah, who knows where your ear's been?

28:53.560 --> 28:55.560
I put those pencils in my mouth.

28:55.560 --> 28:59.560
I put them in my ear.

28:59.560 --> 29:01.560
Hey guys.

29:01.560 --> 29:05.560
Doug looks over at you wide-eyed.

29:05.560 --> 29:14.560
I am here so that we can figure this out so that I can get back into my body.

29:14.560 --> 29:15.560
Correct.

29:15.560 --> 29:16.560
Yes.

29:16.560 --> 29:18.560
I just want to make that clear.

29:18.560 --> 29:20.560
Unless you like an upgrade.

29:20.560 --> 29:21.560
I am...

29:21.560 --> 29:22.560
Younger model.

29:22.560 --> 29:26.560
...interested if this is...

29:26.560 --> 29:29.560
He like rubs his fingers together symbolizing money.

29:29.560 --> 29:30.560
Mm-hmm.

29:31.560 --> 29:34.560
I will help you in any way I possibly can.

29:34.560 --> 29:36.560
Oh, yeah.

29:36.560 --> 29:38.560
I think we could probably work something out.

29:38.560 --> 29:42.560
We happen to have $5 million sitting down at the station.

29:42.560 --> 29:47.560
I shouldn't have told you the amount that really hinders my negotiating.

29:47.560 --> 29:49.560
I forget I said anything.

29:49.560 --> 29:51.560
Clark, do you want to take...

29:51.560 --> 29:53.560
Clark starts pulling out his wallet.

29:53.560 --> 29:54.560
I got a...

29:54.560 --> 29:55.560
Looks like a 20.

29:55.560 --> 29:58.560
That's a good start.

29:58.560 --> 30:01.560
So, just figured I'd let you know.

30:01.560 --> 30:04.560
If you want to have another phone call with this other person,

30:04.560 --> 30:06.560
you can go ahead and throw it on speakerphone.

30:06.560 --> 30:09.560
That way all three of you can talk to the man on the other end.

30:09.560 --> 30:13.560
What a smart idea.

30:13.560 --> 30:14.560
God damn.

30:14.560 --> 30:16.560
Doug, this is why we pay you.

30:16.560 --> 30:20.560
Chad is the embodiment of everything Zach has wanted to say to us,

30:20.560 --> 30:26.560
but couldn't because he didn't have a character voice to do it in.

30:26.560 --> 30:28.560
My name is Doug.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.560
Oh, yeah. Chad Doug.

30:30.560 --> 30:33.560
Okay, let's call up Gary.

30:38.560 --> 30:39.560
Ring it.

30:42.560 --> 30:46.560
You hear a click on the other line as the phone is answered,

30:46.560 --> 30:49.560
and you hear Gary Daley saying,

30:49.560 --> 30:53.560
I told you, you old witch, you're just going crazy.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.560
That's all and that's fine.

30:55.560 --> 30:57.560
And we can deal with that hello.

30:57.560 --> 30:59.560
Hey, Gary. Gary Daley.

30:59.560 --> 31:01.560
Yes, John Lee Pettymore. Speak of the devil.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.560
Yeah. Well, funny you should say that.

31:04.560 --> 31:07.560
Hey, I've actually got us all here on speaker.

31:07.560 --> 31:08.560
Boys, you want to say hi?

31:08.560 --> 31:09.560
Hey, Gary.

31:09.560 --> 31:10.560
Hey, what's going on?

31:10.560 --> 31:11.560
Oh, hello, Clark. Hello, Keith.

31:11.560 --> 31:14.560
There's also a man named Doug here, but that's just more...

31:14.560 --> 31:16.560
You didn't really need to know that.

31:16.560 --> 31:18.560
Well, hello, Doug. How are you?

31:18.560 --> 31:19.560
Doug, talk to the man.

31:19.560 --> 31:22.560
Oh, I'd really rather not do this.

31:23.560 --> 31:25.560
That's fair. Gary.

31:25.560 --> 31:28.560
So, first of all, Harry, I think, is a little worried about you.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.560
You might just shoot him a text.

31:30.560 --> 31:31.560
Oh, gosh.

31:31.560 --> 31:33.560
You know what, actually, Harry wasn't...

31:33.560 --> 31:34.560
Well, I shouldn't tell you that.

31:34.560 --> 31:35.560
I was worried about you.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.560
I wasn't sure we'd get a hold of you.

31:37.560 --> 31:39.560
Well, I just... Oh, gosh, yeah.

31:39.560 --> 31:41.560
Just seeing the time now, it completely slipped my mind.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.560
I'll absolutely text him.

31:43.560 --> 31:44.560
I'll put you on speaker while I do it.

31:44.560 --> 31:45.560
Gary, where are you?

31:45.560 --> 31:47.560
Yeah. What'd you say about a witch?

31:47.560 --> 31:50.560
What? Oh, no, I'm just hanging out with a friend.

31:51.560 --> 31:52.560
Where at?

31:52.560 --> 31:53.560
Oh, at her house.

31:53.560 --> 31:54.560
Yeah.

31:54.560 --> 31:55.560
Do you know Mildred Mitchell?

31:55.560 --> 31:56.560
We sure do.

31:56.560 --> 31:57.560
Yeah, I'm over...

31:57.560 --> 31:58.560
Is she there?

31:58.560 --> 31:59.560
Yeah, she's here. I'm over at Mildred's house.

31:59.560 --> 32:01.560
Are we on speakerphone now?

32:01.560 --> 32:02.560
God, no.

32:04.560 --> 32:06.560
No, she's actually... She's having a bit of a breakdown.

32:06.560 --> 32:08.560
I'm over here trying to work her through it.

32:08.560 --> 32:09.560
Real quick.

32:09.560 --> 32:10.560
Who was Mildred Mitchell?

32:10.560 --> 32:12.560
She lived across the street from John Peters.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.560
She was one of the first NPCs we ever talked with.

32:14.560 --> 32:15.560
Pot smoking.

32:15.560 --> 32:18.560
Oh, and it's her daughter who used the gun and went crazy.

32:18.560 --> 32:19.560
Right.

32:19.560 --> 32:20.560
Tilly D?

32:20.560 --> 32:21.560
Granddaughter.

32:21.560 --> 32:22.560
Granddaughter.

32:22.560 --> 32:23.560
Tilly B.

32:23.560 --> 32:24.560
Tilly B.

32:24.560 --> 32:25.560
Tilly D.

32:25.560 --> 32:26.560
Hey.

32:26.560 --> 32:27.560
Hello?

32:27.560 --> 32:28.560
Yeah, hey, so kind of...

32:28.560 --> 32:30.560
You were on mute there for a second.

32:30.560 --> 32:34.560
Gary, Harry kind of spilled the beans about your coven or whatever it is.

32:34.560 --> 32:37.560
Oh, well, I mean, it's not much of a secret.

32:37.560 --> 32:38.560
I don't know.

32:38.560 --> 32:39.560
It's a book club of sorts.

32:39.560 --> 32:42.560
Of sorts seems to be the operative word.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.560
Yeah, we're a sorcerer's guild.

32:44.560 --> 32:45.560
Yeah.

32:45.560 --> 32:46.560
Wow.

32:46.560 --> 32:47.560
Interesting.

32:47.560 --> 32:49.560
Wait, have you tortured anything recently?

32:49.560 --> 32:50.560
Oh, God, no.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.560
No, it's been years.

32:52.560 --> 32:56.560
Well, all right, Gary, you might have noticed the world's gone to shit.

32:56.560 --> 32:57.560
Yeah, yeah.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.560
People are not around.

32:59.560 --> 33:03.560
Yeah, and obviously something supernatural seems to be involved.

33:03.560 --> 33:05.560
I couldn't agree more.

33:05.560 --> 33:06.560
You got any theories on that?

33:06.560 --> 33:08.560
Well, I have five.

33:08.560 --> 33:09.560
Let me run them down for you.

33:09.560 --> 33:11.560
Fuck, I said five.

33:11.560 --> 33:13.560
You can say three.

33:13.560 --> 33:14.560
Three.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.560
I have three theories.

33:16.560 --> 33:19.560
Let me run them down for you.

33:19.560 --> 33:25.560
My first theory, the strongest in my opinion, is that Jesus came back, right?

33:25.560 --> 33:26.560
Now, don't get me wrong.

33:26.560 --> 33:28.060
He's not like the normal Jesus.

33:28.060 --> 33:30.560
No, this is like a cool Jesus.

33:30.560 --> 33:36.560
And he came back and he took care of all of the weird people, the normies.

33:36.560 --> 33:37.560
You know what I mean?

33:37.560 --> 33:38.560
Yeah, I think he just knocked them out.

33:38.560 --> 33:39.560
Now, that's my first theory.

33:39.560 --> 33:42.560
Now, my second theory is that they all left.

33:42.560 --> 33:44.560
They all just moved.

33:44.560 --> 33:47.560
You know, I think a lot of them were really upset with the police work around here.

33:47.560 --> 33:52.560
The jobs had been drying up for some time, so maybe everyone just decided to leave at

33:52.560 --> 33:53.560
the same time.

33:53.560 --> 33:54.560
I don't know.

33:54.560 --> 33:55.560
Who knows?

33:55.560 --> 33:59.560
And then my third theory is that, you know, cults.

33:59.560 --> 34:02.560
So, probably a cult.

34:02.560 --> 34:03.560
So that's the thing.

34:03.560 --> 34:06.560
We're not overly familiar with cults, but it seems like you are.

34:06.560 --> 34:11.560
Have you seen any in the area or signs of cult activity?

34:11.560 --> 34:14.560
Have you been to the first Church of Contingent?

34:14.560 --> 34:17.560
That's pretty pithy, but this is a Christian town.

34:17.560 --> 34:19.560
I'll ask you to mind your tongue.

34:19.560 --> 34:21.560
Okay, you know what I mean though.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.560
They all repeat each other and stuff.

34:23.560 --> 34:24.560
It's fucking weird.

34:24.560 --> 34:25.560
Alright, alright, alright.

34:25.560 --> 34:27.560
Let's not rock a boat.

34:27.560 --> 34:29.560
Whatever.

34:29.560 --> 34:30.560
Jesus freak.

34:30.560 --> 34:34.560
Well, John Lee Pettymore is not going to apologize for his faith.

34:34.560 --> 34:36.560
Should we just tell him what we think is going on?

34:36.560 --> 34:37.560
Well, yeah.

34:37.560 --> 34:40.560
Why are you asking, I mean, me about these things?

34:40.560 --> 34:43.560
Because it's kind of your bag, man.

34:43.560 --> 34:44.560
You seem like a spooky boy.

34:44.560 --> 34:48.560
Well, I've read a lot of books, but none of them seem to have been true for a while.

34:48.560 --> 34:49.560
So, uh.

34:49.560 --> 34:51.560
Okay, but back to the cult thing.

34:51.560 --> 34:52.560
Sure.

34:52.560 --> 34:55.560
Besides the church, what cults have you seen?

34:55.560 --> 34:56.560
Oh, I don't know.

34:56.560 --> 35:01.560
I mean, honestly, that woman Carrie Pages who had the protesters all riled up against you.

35:01.560 --> 35:04.560
I think, you know, she might have had something going on.

35:04.560 --> 35:08.560
She had a lot of power, you know, with her seat on the city council.

35:08.560 --> 35:15.560
And, uh, she was really getting people angry about your lack of attention to detail of the police work and contention.

35:15.560 --> 35:17.560
This is all my fault. I couldn't find her dog.

35:17.560 --> 35:19.560
You know what, you're probably right, Clark.

35:19.560 --> 35:21.560
But we'll deal with that later.

35:21.560 --> 35:24.560
For now, just shoulder the burden of your shame.

35:24.560 --> 35:26.560
It's the goddamn case I couldn't close.

35:26.560 --> 35:28.560
And get on with the job.

35:28.560 --> 35:34.560
The one case I couldn't crack is that fucking dog.

35:34.560 --> 35:37.560
Okay, well, Gary, you've been about as much help as Harry.

35:37.560 --> 35:40.560
Well, actually, you did give us that Carrie Pages lead. That was pretty good.

35:40.560 --> 35:42.560
Hey, Gary, how's Mildred doing?

35:42.560 --> 35:50.560
Oh, I don't. She, you know, she keeps staring at this picture that she has and she thinks that it changed somehow.

35:50.560 --> 35:51.560
I don't know. It's crazy.

35:51.560 --> 35:56.560
She, like, believes that her histories have been split somehow.

35:56.560 --> 35:57.560
Does that make sense?

35:57.560 --> 36:01.560
She doesn't understand. She thinks that she's a part of a different reality.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.560
I'm sorry, Keith. Did I cut you off there?

36:03.560 --> 36:05.560
What was the picture of and what is it of now?

36:05.560 --> 36:09.560
Oh, well, it's just a picture of the founders of the town.

36:09.560 --> 36:16.560
And she is dead certain that Silas Cole looks different than he did before.

36:16.560 --> 36:26.560
And I, you know, if you're asking my opinion, I think he looks pretty similar and maybe the exact same.

36:26.560 --> 36:29.560
Probably the exact same.

36:29.560 --> 36:35.560
But she also is claiming that, you know, did you hear about her granddaughter going missing?

36:35.560 --> 36:37.560
Yeah, we knew about that.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.560
So she's yeah.

36:39.560 --> 36:42.560
Can you can you if she's willing to come to the phone, that'd be great.

36:42.560 --> 36:47.560
But you could ask her if you want to describe the difference between the two people.

36:47.560 --> 36:49.560
Sure. Yeah, no, she's pretty distraught.

36:49.560 --> 36:55.560
But so I can't remember exactly what her voice sounds like right now.

36:55.560 --> 37:02.560
She's crying a lot and she just keeps saying that he's not as attractive as he used to be used to be far more attractive.

37:02.560 --> 37:07.560
And now he's a bit dumber looking, but similar, but stupider.

37:07.560 --> 37:18.560
And and then she's claiming that there in the reflection of a glass part in the picture is her granddaughter, Tildy B. Mitchell.

37:18.560 --> 37:24.560
But, you know, that's just crazy because there's no way, obviously, and she's just losing her shit.

37:24.560 --> 37:28.560
Yeah, Gary, it sounds like she's pretty distraught.

37:28.560 --> 37:30.560
I'm going to take you off speaker for just one second.

37:30.560 --> 37:35.560
Beep. This sounds like something sounds like we're getting real close to this.

37:35.560 --> 37:40.560
Yeah. People like this has some sort of connection with people are being Ray and back in time.

37:40.560 --> 37:43.560
Ray and who's the girl that died?

37:43.560 --> 37:48.560
Ari Ari and Ray and all the other names potentially.

37:48.560 --> 37:53.560
I might have to do with the split timelines, but it seems like we kind of know where these people are going now.

37:53.560 --> 37:57.560
Go ahead and roll sanity for me. Wow. It's really hard to pass sanity when you have.

37:57.560 --> 38:00.560
Can you give me that blue set or just, yeah, whatever.

38:00.560 --> 38:07.560
Fifty three on a twenty six. I fail. I fail. I fail with a sixty nine. Sixty two. I fail as well.

38:07.560 --> 38:12.560
Oh, nice. Clark, you don't lose. I'm not as sexually as Joe. You're all sixty nine.

38:12.560 --> 38:16.560
You gain sanity. Dude, honestly, you're back to full sanity.

38:16.560 --> 38:22.560
If you rolled like it doesn't have to be a positive, but if you roll sixty nine, nothing bad can happen.

38:22.560 --> 38:27.560
It's like a fluke sick, like half success.

38:27.560 --> 38:33.560
That's really interesting, though, because when you do sixty nine, something very bad could happen.

38:33.560 --> 38:38.560
It's true. It never does. It's just always unsatisfying for both parties.

38:38.560 --> 38:42.560
Clark, you lose no sanity. The other two, you lose one sanity each.

38:42.560 --> 38:47.560
And having this realization, you were both, I think, good to go.

38:47.560 --> 38:54.560
Right. I mean, we can talk about what you think that means, but it seems like you believe these people are going back in time.

38:54.560 --> 38:57.560
I think that's going to make you question reality.

38:57.560 --> 39:01.560
Definitely. I question reality.

39:01.560 --> 39:05.560
I do. I do have one more question for Gary before we let him go.

39:05.560 --> 39:08.560
Are you still on mute? You hear vaguely.

39:08.560 --> 39:12.560
I'll switch him back. Hey, Gary, can you tell me a little bit about your grandfather?

39:12.560 --> 39:16.560
Well, yeah, he's a quiet man. He sang a lot.

39:16.560 --> 39:19.560
Would you ever use the word wizard to describe him?

39:19.560 --> 39:22.560
Oh, yeah. I had a little dream last night and the boys.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.560
Tell me about it. The boys can hear it.

39:24.560 --> 39:30.560
Well, I seem to have a memory from my past, but from a time before I could have memories, it was me.

39:30.560 --> 39:34.560
And I think Clark is little babies in clinkers.

39:34.560 --> 39:41.560
And you were putting some kind of protection on us. And you said your your grandpa was a wizard who had told you about it.

39:41.560 --> 39:46.560
And you'd hope you hoped it would work. Did that happen, Gary?

39:46.560 --> 39:50.560
Well, yeah. How did you see that?

39:50.560 --> 39:59.560
I have the second sight, Gary. It's become plain to me over the past two days, but that's neither here nor there.

39:59.560 --> 40:04.560
John, I've never told you this. Keith Clark, you're on the phone as well.

40:04.560 --> 40:05.560
I'm here.

40:05.560 --> 40:06.560
Yeah?

40:06.560 --> 40:13.560
I was always too afraid to actually let you know because I thought maybe it would have some sort of reaction.

40:13.560 --> 40:15.560
You're all of our father? Are you our daddy?

40:15.560 --> 40:23.560
But my grandfather, he gave me this book and it had three pages left in it.

40:23.560 --> 40:30.560
And I was to read those pages after tearing them out of the book and then spill blood upon your heads.

40:30.560 --> 40:38.560
Now, I know that sounds crazy, but when I did that, the words dance like magic on the page.

40:38.560 --> 40:44.560
And they came off like sparks. And it was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.

40:44.560 --> 40:50.560
And it surrounded you in this light, this bathe of light.

40:50.560 --> 40:58.560
And I did it because my grandpa told me that the three of you, the three of you are the key to everything.

40:58.560 --> 41:02.560
Now, I know that sounds extreme, but I did my part.

41:02.560 --> 41:08.560
I don't know what your part is, but it's time for you to take care of it. Seems like to me.

41:08.560 --> 41:12.560
Wow, Gary. That's heavy.

41:12.560 --> 41:15.560
Gary, did your grandpa tell you what that did?

41:15.560 --> 41:19.560
He just said fortune would be on your side.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.560
It's a spell to give you 100 luck.

41:21.560 --> 41:23.560
Well, thank you for telling us that.

41:23.560 --> 41:27.560
He also mentioned it was a spell to give you 100 luck.

41:28.560 --> 41:30.560
My mind is blown right now.

41:30.560 --> 41:32.560
You finally have been for a 100-inch cop.

41:32.560 --> 41:34.560
But anyway, Gary.

41:34.560 --> 41:39.560
I don't know what kind of jokes John Lee Fadymore makes, but I think they're probably like that.

41:39.560 --> 41:41.560
Better ones.

41:41.560 --> 41:44.560
He does, yeah. He's smarter than that.

41:44.560 --> 41:50.560
All right, well, good luck to y'all. I really need to get Mildred calmed down here.

41:50.560 --> 41:51.560
You do that.

41:51.560 --> 41:55.560
She does not like you all. Let me tell you, you need to stay away from her, I'm guessing.

41:55.560 --> 41:58.560
All right, thanks for the heads up on that. And thank you for everything else, Gary.

41:58.560 --> 42:00.560
You boys, thanks for blessing us.

42:00.560 --> 42:01.560
Yeah, thanks for the magic.

42:01.560 --> 42:02.560
Those children.

42:02.560 --> 42:03.560
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

42:03.560 --> 42:05.560
I don't know if I would have been able to handle it any earlier than this.

42:05.560 --> 42:08.560
Yeah, three days ago I wouldn't have believed you, Gary, so.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.560
Well, sounds like this is the time.

42:10.560 --> 42:11.560
Yeah.

42:11.560 --> 42:13.560
He's still on the phone, isn't he? Or did we hang up?

42:13.560 --> 42:15.560
Let's do a hang up just in case we haven't.

42:15.560 --> 42:16.560
Click.

42:18.560 --> 42:19.560
Perfect.

42:19.560 --> 42:23.560
Keith reaches over and turns off your phone as he's saying bye.

42:23.560 --> 42:24.560
Wow.

42:24.560 --> 42:28.560
We know we're all protected by a wizard's magic.

42:28.560 --> 42:29.560
From what, though?

42:29.560 --> 42:30.560
Which is nice.

42:30.560 --> 42:31.560
Evil, presumably.

42:31.560 --> 42:32.560
Okay, I like that.

42:32.560 --> 42:34.560
Can you guys roll sanity for me?

42:36.560 --> 42:37.560
Ninety-one.

42:37.560 --> 42:38.560
I pass.

42:38.560 --> 42:39.560
With a four.

42:39.560 --> 42:40.560
Nice.

42:40.560 --> 42:42.560
Clark, you lose no sanity.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.560
Nice.

42:43.560 --> 42:44.560
Jon, you lose one more sanity.

42:44.560 --> 42:46.560
I rolled an 18 on a 17.

42:46.560 --> 42:48.560
Oh, fuck, that's so brutal.

42:48.560 --> 42:51.560
You lose another sanity and you're down to 16.

42:52.560 --> 42:53.560
That's the point I'm getting to, though.

42:53.560 --> 42:54.560
Where are you guys at right now?

42:54.560 --> 42:55.560
Twenty-four.

42:55.560 --> 42:57.560
Like, there's no fucking way to roll on this.

42:57.560 --> 42:58.560
I've got a 26.

42:58.560 --> 43:04.560
Actually, there's literally a one in four chance, but there's not literally a one in four chance, but there's so nearly.

43:04.560 --> 43:05.560
So close.

43:05.560 --> 43:14.560
Well, I don't know what to think about having blood poured on me as a baby, but if it helps me not get attacked by evil spirits.

43:14.560 --> 43:16.560
I like the part about the words dancing off the page.

43:16.560 --> 43:17.560
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

43:17.560 --> 43:19.560
It's like a Disney movie.

43:19.560 --> 43:20.560
Are you guys buying that shit?

43:20.560 --> 43:23.560
That he saw light around us and dancing and words?

43:23.560 --> 43:24.560
There's no way.

43:24.560 --> 43:27.560
I have seen stranger shit happen these past few days.

43:27.560 --> 43:29.560
Yeah, I'll give you that.

43:29.560 --> 43:33.560
Okay, well, all I can tell you is they seem real sincere about it in the dream.

43:33.560 --> 43:41.560
I didn't dream the part about the magic words, but I did see him put the blood on our heads and he seemed to be pretty into what he was doing.

43:41.560 --> 43:44.560
Would we know his grandpa's name?

43:44.560 --> 43:48.560
Is he somebody in our maybe town's history that we would know or anything like that?

43:48.560 --> 43:50.560
Or just because we know Gary so well?

43:50.560 --> 43:51.560
Yeah, of course.

43:51.560 --> 43:55.560
I've changed Gary's grandpa's diapers.

43:55.560 --> 43:57.560
Gingerfrid daily.

43:57.560 --> 43:58.560
Gingerfrid?

43:58.560 --> 43:59.560
Gingerfrid.

43:59.560 --> 44:00.560
Gingerfrid, I like it.

44:00.560 --> 44:03.560
We called him Fred.

44:03.560 --> 44:04.560
Those who knew him.

44:04.560 --> 44:07.560
Well, is there anything else we need to do before we head?

44:07.560 --> 44:08.560
I guess we're heading there already.

44:08.560 --> 44:10.560
Yeah, we are on the highway.

44:10.560 --> 44:13.560
This whole fucking episode is just...

44:13.560 --> 44:18.560
The filter on the colorization changes as you drive into the city.

44:18.560 --> 44:23.560
Everything is drab and gray with a sickly green tint to it.

44:23.560 --> 44:26.560
The streets are covered in trash and spilled liquids.

44:26.560 --> 44:32.560
There is a scent in the air like someone left out cheese in a colostomy bag on every corner.

44:32.560 --> 44:40.560
The faces of the buildings are slathered in billboards and the faces of the people bumbling about are bloated and lifeless.

44:41.560 --> 44:48.560
In a strange opposition to all this depressive scenery, there are beautiful flowers in every shade and shape,

44:48.560 --> 44:55.560
growing in every otherwise empty alleyway and out of many cracks in the sidewalks and roads.

44:55.560 --> 45:04.560
Rosemary and her runner car leads you downtown to one of the tallest buildings scraping the putrid sky.

45:04.560 --> 45:10.560
This towering building has a granite finish and the reflections wave as you approach,

45:10.560 --> 45:16.560
turning down into a small parking garage below this massive stone high rise.

45:16.560 --> 45:24.560
Down in this parking garage, there are women in suits touching their earpieces like cliche security guards standing against the wall near the entrance.

45:24.560 --> 45:34.560
There's an elevator door in a nearby corner and Rosemary parks, gets out, walks over, and presses the button and it lights up green.

45:34.560 --> 45:39.560
Hey Rosemary, I know we're about to do some important stuff, but is the city always this floral?

45:39.560 --> 45:41.560
Yeah, I asked an answer.

45:41.560 --> 45:45.560
Okay, I get out of the car once we park. I guess we're already out of the car.

45:45.560 --> 45:48.560
Yeah, we're on the way up the elevator. Or we're waiting for the elevator.

45:48.560 --> 45:50.560
So what floor are we going to?

45:50.560 --> 45:52.560
Eh, it'll take you.

45:52.560 --> 46:03.560
The door opens and the elevator's interior walls, floor, and ceiling are this like beautiful onyx and it's very reflective.

46:03.560 --> 46:05.560
Nice elevator you got here.

46:07.560 --> 46:10.560
Doug is standing next to you guys.

46:10.560 --> 46:12.560
Should I come with you?

46:12.560 --> 46:14.560
Yeah, you might as well.

46:14.560 --> 46:17.560
Should I wait? It's up to you guys. I'll do whatever you want.

46:17.560 --> 46:23.560
Hey Chad, you might look through all your pockets and if there's anything that says you're an FBI agent, leave it in the car?

46:23.560 --> 46:26.560
Or should we bring them with us?

46:26.560 --> 46:29.560
Let's bring them with us for protection, for power.

46:29.560 --> 46:35.560
Yeah, we've got, we'll say we're not just a small town PD. We're working with the feds, you know?

46:35.560 --> 46:37.560
Oh yeah, I think they'd probably give you leverage.

46:37.560 --> 46:39.560
I dig it. Thanks Rosemary.

46:39.560 --> 46:45.560
Also, I've got, I have the very tiny but very powerful gun like hidden away in my pants.

46:45.560 --> 46:46.560
Nice.

46:46.560 --> 46:47.560
What about your weapons?

46:47.560 --> 46:53.560
I've got like my pistol on my hip, but just in case I like try to take stuff away from me.

46:53.560 --> 46:55.560
Okay.

46:58.560 --> 46:59.560
What?

46:59.560 --> 47:01.560
Thomas made a dick joke.

47:01.560 --> 47:03.560
My weapons? Is that what you said?

47:03.560 --> 47:07.560
You're like, I have a very tiny but very powerful thing in my pants.

47:07.560 --> 47:09.560
I didn't catch it either.

47:09.560 --> 47:11.560
That's good though.

47:12.560 --> 47:19.560
We don't know what kind of jokes John Lee Pettymore makes, but we know what kind of jokes Thomas makes.

47:19.560 --> 47:24.560
All right, so the four of you get in and the door closes.

47:24.560 --> 47:29.560
As it's closing, I'll see you when you're finished, I guess.

47:29.560 --> 47:39.560
In this elevator, there are no buttons, no numbers, no emergency phone, just this shimmering black mirror on all sides.

47:39.560 --> 47:40.560
I hope it works.

47:40.560 --> 47:42.560
Wait, so Rosemary didn't get in the elevator with us?

47:42.560 --> 47:43.560
That is correct.

47:43.560 --> 47:44.560
Okay.

47:44.560 --> 47:45.560
So it's just the four of us.

47:45.560 --> 47:46.560
Okay.

47:46.560 --> 47:47.560
Are we moving up?

47:47.560 --> 47:48.560
Nope.

47:48.560 --> 47:49.560
Are we moving at all?

47:49.560 --> 47:50.560
Nope.

47:50.560 --> 47:51.560
I touched the wall.

47:51.560 --> 47:52.560
It's cold.

47:52.560 --> 47:53.560
It's a cold wall, guys.

47:53.560 --> 48:00.560
John Clark says, elevator up.

48:00.560 --> 48:01.560
Engage.

48:01.560 --> 48:02.560
Engage.

48:02.560 --> 48:05.560
Elevator go.

48:05.560 --> 48:09.560
Elevator skyward.

48:09.560 --> 48:13.560
Clark jumps up and down.

48:13.560 --> 48:14.560
Do I feel a give?

48:14.560 --> 48:15.560
It doesn't move at all.

48:15.560 --> 48:16.560
It's just all black walls, right?

48:16.560 --> 48:17.560
Yep.

48:17.560 --> 48:21.560
So I hold the gun up to where cameras might be.

48:21.560 --> 48:23.560
I'm like, hey, we got what you're seeking.

48:23.560 --> 48:25.560
We seek an audience.

48:25.560 --> 48:27.560
One of the walls opens up.

48:27.560 --> 48:28.560
What do we see?

48:29.560 --> 48:34.560
You see a small room and a spotlight coming down on a figure behind a desk.

48:34.560 --> 48:35.560
I walk in.

48:35.560 --> 48:37.560
He's really killing it with the atmosphere.

48:37.560 --> 48:38.560
Do you all walk in?

48:38.560 --> 48:39.560
All things considered.

48:39.560 --> 48:40.560
Yeah, I walk in.

48:40.560 --> 48:41.560
How small a room?

48:41.560 --> 48:42.560
12 by 8.

48:42.560 --> 48:43.560
Nice.

48:43.560 --> 48:44.560
What happens when you walk in?

48:44.560 --> 48:45.560
Yeah, I go in.

48:45.560 --> 48:46.560
The door closes behind you.

48:46.560 --> 48:51.560
In front of you, there is a figure with a massive frame.

48:51.560 --> 48:54.560
It is completely gaunt.

48:54.560 --> 48:56.560
No muscle or fat.

48:56.560 --> 49:01.560
You can just imagine skin stretched across long bones.

49:01.560 --> 49:07.560
They're dressed in a fitted black tuxedo, and the spotlight shows off a bright red bowtie,

49:07.560 --> 49:12.560
but only reaches to illuminate the lower half of this person's face.

49:12.560 --> 49:15.560
The skin on the chin is almost translucent.

49:15.560 --> 49:16.560
No hair.

49:16.560 --> 49:24.560
Not even a slight shadow of facial hair can be seen on either side of two thin, bright red lips.

49:24.560 --> 49:27.560
Actually, there's really no lips at all.

49:27.560 --> 49:34.560
Just this candy red lipstick messily encircling a round hole above the sharp see-through chin

49:34.560 --> 49:38.560
when the orifice begins to move.

49:38.560 --> 49:40.560
Hello?

49:40.560 --> 49:43.560
I am Marvin Glass.

49:43.560 --> 49:46.560
I know who you are.

49:46.560 --> 49:49.560
Do you know why you are here?

49:49.560 --> 49:50.560
Kind of.

49:50.560 --> 49:52.560
Not particularly.

49:52.560 --> 49:53.560
We think so?

49:53.560 --> 49:55.560
Why do you think we're here?

49:55.560 --> 50:02.560
Ferguson Fucking Beans was trying to buy my lost cocaine off a contention police officer.

50:02.560 --> 50:06.560
I wasn't going to let it get stolen again.

50:06.560 --> 50:10.560
That's why I sent Rosemary to take the money back.

50:10.560 --> 50:12.560
Money that is rightfully mine.

50:12.560 --> 50:15.560
Oh, we kind of thought you sent Rosemary after your boys.

50:15.560 --> 50:17.560
You know they're a missing rat.

50:17.560 --> 50:18.560
Or one of them is.

50:18.560 --> 50:20.560
And the other one's a lunatic now.

50:20.560 --> 50:23.560
I am fully aware of my son's condition.

50:23.560 --> 50:27.560
Yeah, I don't know anything about that cocaine deal.

50:27.560 --> 50:29.560
Who stole the cocaine from you originally?

50:29.560 --> 50:35.560
You don't know anything about the cocaine deal that you were one half of?

50:35.560 --> 50:37.560
Nope.

50:37.560 --> 50:38.560
I sure don't.

50:38.560 --> 50:42.560
Who stole the cocaine originally from you?

50:42.560 --> 50:45.560
That's not what we're here to discuss.

50:45.560 --> 50:47.560
Yeah, we're not here about the cocaine period.

50:47.560 --> 50:49.560
We're here about the gun.

50:50.560 --> 50:59.560
No, I specifically sent Rosemary to take the money from the deal and bring it back to me.

50:59.560 --> 51:04.560
I thought that is why you were here is to bring my money back and pay your pendants.

51:04.560 --> 51:06.560
I step up next to John.

51:06.560 --> 51:08.560
Rosemary definitely told her she was looking for the gun.

51:08.560 --> 51:10.560
Yeah, she was pretty obsessed with that gun.

51:10.560 --> 51:11.560
Doug.

51:11.560 --> 51:12.560
Yes.

51:12.560 --> 51:13.560
Doug, come on.

51:13.560 --> 51:14.560
I need to talk to you real quick.

51:14.560 --> 51:18.560
Okay, so I guess you guys walk into the corner of this dark room.

51:18.560 --> 51:19.560
Alright, Doug.

51:19.560 --> 51:24.560
What we need you to say is that the FBI has taken that money.

51:24.560 --> 51:26.560
They confiscated it all.

51:26.560 --> 51:30.560
If he asks you any details, we'll interrupt, alright?

51:30.560 --> 51:37.560
If you get in over your head, but I need you to say that that money is gone so we can get this conversation on the gun.

51:37.560 --> 51:39.560
Okay, yeah, sure.

51:39.560 --> 51:41.560
Alright, and you guys walk back.

51:42.560 --> 51:57.560
Sir, ma'am, I do believe that that money that you are speaking of is currently part of an ongoing investigation with the FBI and we have confiscated that money.

51:57.560 --> 51:59.560
Yeah, what he said.

51:59.560 --> 52:00.560
Yeah.

52:01.560 --> 52:05.560
That is not what Rosemary has told me.

52:05.560 --> 52:08.560
She said that you guys have the money.

52:08.560 --> 52:10.560
You brought it here for me.

52:10.560 --> 52:13.560
Rosemary didn't say anything to us about some money.

52:13.560 --> 52:15.560
She said you really wanted that gun.

52:15.560 --> 52:17.560
That's what we brought.

52:17.560 --> 52:21.560
We're not here to talk about financial matters.

52:21.560 --> 52:23.560
We're here to talk about your son.

52:23.560 --> 52:24.560
Yeah.

52:24.560 --> 52:27.560
Oh, no, no, no.

52:29.560 --> 52:30.560
I am sorry.

52:31.560 --> 52:33.560
What I meant to say was...

52:33.560 --> 52:47.560
I am saddened by poor Alfred's condition that he must babble on about this gun, but that is not why you are here.

52:47.560 --> 52:51.560
Sir, we're not actually here about Alfred and the gun necessarily.

52:51.560 --> 52:54.560
We're here about getting Jermaine back.

52:54.560 --> 52:56.560
From what, the dead?

52:56.560 --> 52:57.560
From the past.

52:57.560 --> 52:58.560
Go on.

52:58.560 --> 52:59.560
We have a theory.

52:59.560 --> 53:03.560
Yeah, well, it probably requires some backstories.

53:03.560 --> 53:08.560
Something's descended upon contention, the town we're from.

53:08.560 --> 53:13.560
And it seems to be spreading and it's not going to be long before it gets to the city.

53:13.560 --> 53:15.560
It took your boy.

53:15.560 --> 53:19.560
We think we can get him back, but we need your help.

53:19.560 --> 53:25.560
We shouldn't be asking for the resources of a criminal organization, I know that.

53:26.560 --> 53:29.560
But we don't have any other options.

53:29.560 --> 53:35.560
The FBI, you know, Doug here, Chad here is taking us seriously, but his higher-ups aren't.

53:35.560 --> 53:38.560
So they're not providing us with resources.

53:38.560 --> 53:42.560
What's happened to your boy has happened to a lot of people in our town and we're trying to get him back.

53:42.560 --> 53:45.560
If you can help us out, we can get your boy back to you.

53:46.560 --> 53:54.560
I believe that you underestimate my love of money.

53:55.560 --> 54:04.560
And overestimate my love for my pitiful son.

54:04.560 --> 54:07.560
Well, that is precisely the miscalculation we've made here, yeah.

54:07.560 --> 54:09.560
We have made a horrible mistake.

54:09.560 --> 54:12.560
Right. Rosemary really harped up that gun thing.

54:12.560 --> 54:16.560
It seemed like the one thing you wanted in the world, so we thought we could offer that to you.

54:16.560 --> 54:22.560
It seems that Rosemary must be taken care of in a different light.

54:22.560 --> 54:25.560
Yeah, she just walked away from five million dollars, by the way.

54:25.560 --> 54:26.560
I'm sorry.

54:26.560 --> 54:29.560
Just set it down when I asked her to. She could have brought you some of that money.

54:29.560 --> 54:34.560
He is visually agitated by you saying that.

54:34.560 --> 54:36.560
Clark wants to scan the room, are we alone?

54:36.560 --> 54:39.560
It seems to be just the four of you and this man.

54:39.560 --> 54:41.560
Do you have any more lights you could turn on?

54:41.560 --> 54:49.560
Good to see you, Keith. You know, I didn't expect you to be so effective when I hired you,

54:49.560 --> 54:53.560
everyone's favorite fuck-up, to murder your own brother.

54:53.560 --> 54:55.560
What are you talking about?

54:55.560 --> 55:01.560
It's a very good murder, Keith. You know, we fully expected your niece to have to finish the job.

55:01.560 --> 55:06.560
And out of the darkness, a teenage girl approaches and stands next to Marvin Glass.

55:06.560 --> 55:11.560
Keith, she flips you double birds and smiles as Marvin continues.

55:11.560 --> 55:16.560
She is being trained by a woman for the history books.

55:17.560 --> 55:19.560
And a third figure comes into the light.

55:19.560 --> 55:25.560
This woman is shaped like a football with spiky white hair frantically flopping atop a pointy head.

55:25.560 --> 55:32.560
She is wearing a large white lab coat and those big chunky evil scientist goggles that evil scientists wear.

55:32.560 --> 55:39.560
This pair is wonky, one goggle pointing down and away to accommodate the odd head shape of the wearer.

55:39.560 --> 55:50.560
This mad scientist stands tall behind Francis Beans, slowly tapping her long, wobbly fingers against Keith Sneese's collarbones.

55:52.560 --> 55:56.560
Keith, you didn't tell us you were involved in some series of unfortunate events shit.

55:56.560 --> 55:59.560
I don't have any idea what they're talking about.

55:59.560 --> 56:01.560
Me neither, with my thang.

56:01.560 --> 56:03.560
Francis, it's nice to see you.

56:03.560 --> 56:07.560
Francis and the woman behind her back away slowly.

56:07.560 --> 56:12.560
And once again, all you can see is the front half of the figure standing before you.

56:13.560 --> 56:15.560
Keith, if you're lying to us, god damn it.

56:15.560 --> 56:18.560
I look at the... Is this a woman or a man?

56:18.560 --> 56:19.560
It's Marvin.

56:19.560 --> 56:26.560
Okay, I look at Marvin, I look at both my co-police officers and I look at Marvin and I go, I think you owe me some money.

56:26.560 --> 56:32.560
Your winnings will be collected if you prove yourself worthy.

56:33.560 --> 56:39.560
John, I will help you if you prove yourself capable.

56:40.560 --> 56:44.560
Clark, I'm sorry you had to be here.

56:51.560 --> 56:56.560
The room begins to fill with a noxious gas.

56:56.560 --> 56:59.560
Clark is running back to where the door was, at least.

56:59.560 --> 57:01.560
It is closed.

57:01.560 --> 57:03.560
He's pulling and pushing and doing whatever.

57:03.560 --> 57:07.560
It's an elevator door, so you're fingering at the seams.

57:07.560 --> 57:09.560
Okay.

57:09.560 --> 57:10.560
Well, I mean...

57:10.560 --> 57:11.560
That's a bad word.

57:13.560 --> 57:15.560
I'm fingering the fuck out of the seams.

57:15.560 --> 57:19.560
We are really earning that explicit tag.

57:20.560 --> 57:28.560
Okay, so with my last bit of consciousness, I turned to Keith and I said, did you sell us out, you dirty son of a bitch?

57:28.560 --> 57:30.560
I would never.

57:30.560 --> 57:32.560
And then I pass out.

57:32.560 --> 57:34.560
How convenient.

57:34.560 --> 57:40.560
Congratulations on making the mob boss way fucking scarier than I thought it would be.

57:40.560 --> 57:42.560
Yeah, that was fucking dope.

57:42.560 --> 57:44.560
Yeah, very cool.

57:48.560 --> 57:52.560
You wake up to the feeling of cold metal awkwardly pressing against your skin.

57:52.560 --> 58:01.560
It is abrasively loud, both from jubilant hollering and pulsing bass that shakes your chest and ribcage with each boom.

58:01.560 --> 58:07.560
You have each been crammed into individual cages made entirely of metal bars.

58:07.560 --> 58:13.560
These cages are hanging from the ceiling and outline this smoky, dimly lit room.

58:13.560 --> 58:16.560
There are three other cages next to your own.

58:17.560 --> 58:23.560
They are each inhabited by a person who has also been stripped down to their underwear, just as you have.

58:23.560 --> 58:34.560
There is one adult man that you do not recognize, one child, a boy, and also Doug in the body of Agent Chad.

58:34.560 --> 58:39.560
The man is massive and barely fits. His muscles bulge and press against the inside of the cage.

58:39.560 --> 58:47.560
And the child, the boy, he looks like he could slip right between the metal bars because he is so underfed and sickly looking.

58:47.560 --> 58:50.560
Fifteen feet below, you see the crowd.

58:50.560 --> 58:59.560
About twenty or so fancily clad individuals, each partaking in some sort of vice, be it drinking, smoking, snorting, or all of the above.

58:59.560 --> 59:07.560
The crowd is gathered in the middle of the room where there are recliners and couches, papasans and pallets of blankets and pillows.

59:07.560 --> 59:12.560
They lounge about and look up at the spectacle hanging above them in the middle of the room.

59:12.560 --> 59:15.560
Hanging above the middle of the room is another cage.

59:15.560 --> 59:18.560
It is made entirely of plexiglass.

59:18.560 --> 59:22.560
Inside, there are two teenagers viciously wrestling.

59:22.560 --> 59:26.560
One of them gets the upper hand and moves on top of their opponent.

59:26.560 --> 59:29.560
This kid starts beating the absolute shit out of the other.

59:29.560 --> 59:32.560
Both hands wailing directly into their face.

59:32.560 --> 59:38.560
Blood is spraying down onto the crowd below and they fucking love it.

59:38.560 --> 59:47.560
You notice that the floor of the fighting cage has little holes everywhere to allow anything to drip down onto the spectators.

59:47.560 --> 01:00:00.560
I check in my underwear and see if my gun is still there, my tiny gun.

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:04.560
It's always there, baby.

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:42.560
How am I the only one trying to pull over?

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:53.560
How can you have enough drowning out all the noise?

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:57.560
There's no light at all.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:02.560
No light at all.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:06.560
No light at all.
