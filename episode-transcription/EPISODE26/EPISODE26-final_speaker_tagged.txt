0.00 236.56 speaker0  Hello, garbage people. It's your trash truck driver, Wolf the Dog. And this junkyard dog is here to dump some non-biodegradable news in your mine's landfills. We are coming at you live from the most delicious trash-filled radio station, Contentions' own 694.2 PTBP. Remember, leave those trash cans open for your old buddy Wolf, so I can get me a late-night snack. Hope y'all threw something tasty away. What am I even saying? It's all tasty to me, my babies. Mmmmmm. We got us a new Howlin' with Wolf entry that comes from at Unclear Gamer on Twitter. They tweeted about the show and tagged at PretendingPod. If you want to write a message for Wolf to read on air, follow the lead. Tag us on Instagram or Twitter, at PretendingPod, or write us a five-star review on Apple Podcasts and email us at PretendingPod at Gmail.com. At Unclear Gamer writes, Title, Trouble on the Force. Dear Wolf, After the absolute mess my other officers have made of Condention PD, I have decided to leave my post here and move to the city PD. A lovely woman has replaced me, and she seems blissfully unaware of the wreck she is about to walk into. How can I warn her of her current predicament without shit-talking my former co-workers too much? Thanks, Officer Lauren, which is poorly crossed out, followed by Disgruntled Deputy. Listeners, this is some real spooky shit. I've never heard of an officer in Contention named Lauren. and I found a clip of myself, Wolf the Dog, talking about Officer Lauren. When it comes to advice about the Contention Police Force, I suggest a wide berth. Those boys' minds and moods change about as quickly and as often as my entire reality. Speaking of an unstable existence, it's time for the news. The officers use the radio to put Doug Jacobs in the body of Agent Trent Chad, relegating Agent Chad to a cat body. Rosemary, one of the Glass Crime family bruisers, grabbed a briefcase out of Drew's trunk she claimed has $5 million in it. She was adamant about getting her hands on the gun the officers first found in the possession of Tildy B. Mitchell. Doug saw the ooze inside the police station and everyone freaked out, busting pipes and spraying water everywhere, effectively flooding the station. Doug really lost it when he exclaimed that the water wasn't stopping the oily goop. Jan Manstein, the grieving mother of Ari Manstein, the Contention officer tragically killed in the fire at the city hospital, came by to pick up Ari's things and asked the officers to relay the news to Ari's father Stan, who has been in the city asylum for the past 20 years. Wolf the dog would acquiesce to being locked up in a sanatorium,
230.72 259.20 speaker1  A doe. A deer. A female deer. Ray. A drop of golden sun. I hope we're not recording so there's not just an audio of me going, I got killed by a dog today. Oh yeah, he got torn apart by an Australian Shepherd.
254.44 292.76 speaker2  Because I rode it onto this guy's farm. I was shooting birds out of the sky and just accidentally wandered onto this guy's farm and he came up to me and started shooting me. I thought he was a bounty hunter or something so I killed him and then all the other farmhands were witnesses so I had to kill them and then the dog came and comes up. So yeah, it chased me and then just like ripped my throat out.
288.56 315.52 speaker1  Like I've really tried... I try to be a lot more careful now and I try not to get bounties and shit. I get to like the last one and I miss and he shoots me dead.
311.60 502.56 speaker2  Oh, they finally... they released the Call of Cthulhu game. No, it was a different one than that trailer. What do you do in it? Holy shit, that's dumb. And I love it, not being a gamer, that I can sit down with that game and play it in a day. Hell yeah, just like this campaign. Hell yeah. So, I wanted to talk a little bit at the top about sanity loss and rolling for sanity. The example I'm going to use is, you guys saw the security footage of Dr. Marie Jacobs and the body of Doug Jacobs get smashed in the ground and I asked you to roll sanity and you said, but we've already seen that, why would that affect us? But I was thinking about it and I was like, well maybe not, like it would affect you still, but less so. I was like, okay, so if you pass the sanity loss, A, it's on security footage, you can think whatever you want to think about that being tampered with or whatever, but if you lose on the sanity check, A, it happened somewhere new, it happened in the police station, you didn't know it could happen in the police, you just may have thought that it was... Exactly, or also you realized that last time was real, like you now have proof on footage of what you saw and were probably trying to convince yourself it wasn't real. I don't know about you guys, you guys are pretty dead set on just like... I hope we see it again, I hope we see it again. But in the future, let's try to like come up with reasons why the sand loss happened, like why the fail is more interesting or different than a success on a sanity check. What about way in the future and it's Rosemary's granddaughter, Jessica Andrews called Who I Am.
501.56 510.56 speaker1  Yeah!
508.56 581.56 speaker2  A severe lack of traffic. It's 9am, but the dearth of other cars on the roads is reminiscent of 4am. Sitting at a red light with no one in sight, the feeling is amplified. The turning weather must have pushed much of the population in contention to stay cozied up at home. The beggars on the corners of the intersections, the runners on their morning route, the loitering teenagers on pot, they were all just not around. The protesters, so riled up and determined, have dispersed and are nowhere to be seen. You can vaguely hear the sounds of other cars' life in contention over a heartbreaking, steady roar. It would be so weirdly quiet if it weren't for the many animals still cohabiting in the ponds and creeks. There are fewer than there were even yesterday, but the ones left are growing more vocal, with the cold and lack of food seemingly abandoned by their owners. You pull onto the highway, heading for the city with the sun at your back, in whichever cars and bringing whichever stuff we decide during this next conversation.
580.56 607.56 speaker1  We took three semis. We found it on the lookout. We've got the whole Fast and Furious crew backing us up. We'll find out. Maybe they are.
604.56 614.56 speaker2  Maybe one of them is named Vince. I'm going all original and only the friends.
613.56 624.56 speaker1  What are we doing? Well, before we leave town, well, while we're leaving town, I guess, I kind of want to call.
623.56 630.56 speaker2  Tight. So, what are you driving? How are you getting to the city? Who's in what cars?
629.56 670.56 speaker1  Does Rosemary have a car? Okay. Maybe we should make Rosemary drive to the city in her own car if she'll accept that. And then we can take two cruisers or one cruiser. Let's take one cruiser and then we can play 20 questions. Yeah. Whereas two cruisers is better. It's okay. We're police from a very small town an hour and a half away.
668.56 674.56 speaker2  I think my cruiser is there, right? It is.
673.56 678.56 speaker1  We can take my cruiser.
677.56 686.56 speaker2  They're totaled.
684.56 696.56 speaker1  Was yours involved in the wreck at all? I don't remember. Mine got crushed by John Peters. Yes. Both of your cars were totaled in that wreck. You're right. How did I get home last night?
695.56 701.56 speaker2  I guess you took me.
700.56 715.56 speaker1  Yes. I guess, realistically, we would only be taking yours.
713.56 741.56 speaker2  Agent Trent Chad. You got it? Are in the cruiser, and you have Rosemary driving her own car behind you? You know what? That makes even more sense. Weapons? Hey, don't go inside.
739.56 775.56 speaker1  What did we find at the robot house? We found some cool weapons there, right? Oh. I had a list of them. No, because we gave the sniper to the dude while it was happening.
768.56 789.56 speaker2  Those crates included pistol, shotguns, rifles, a shoulder-mounted anti-aircraft weapon, an EMP rifle, a grappling gun, a small gun that shoots tracers, lots of grenades, a sniper rifle, a very, very tiny but powerful gun.
788.56 792.56 speaker1  Should we take it all?
789.56 794.56 speaker2  Real quick, what is Clark's garage like?
793.56 814.56 speaker1  Very clean. Got a tool bench over on the side there with a lot of tools all hung in their places. That one gun that you said shoots tracers, we clarify that you meant that they shot tracking things, is that right?
813.56 821.56 speaker2  Yeah. Like a home-in device? Like a GPS? Like a GPS. Oh, cool.
820.56 838.56 speaker1  I don't see why not. I think we should take the EMP gun for sure since we fought a robot recently. Yep. And I think we should take those tracers since we'll be messing with the mob. We might need to make sure we know where somebody goes. I'd like the anti-aircraft gun too. Yeah, in case of an emergency.
835.56 859.56 speaker2  And the grappling gun because then we can climb stuff. I want to take my small but very powerful pistol as well. So yeah, let's pretty much take it all. And a shotgun.
857.56 875.56 speaker1  I think we all got our assault rifles.
865.56 877.56 speaker2  And you also have at James the mill worker's house there was also a stash of weapons there. Good ones?
876.56 897.56 speaker1  Yeah, I don't remember what was there. That's the house we're talking about, right? That's what I was talking about the one and what did we find there?
896.56 899.56 speaker2  And body armor.
898.56 901.56 speaker1  Who has the body armor? Was there more than one set?
900.56 934.56 speaker2  You could each have body armor. Let's strap one body armor please. Yeah, one body armor. Hey, you want to take it now? Okay, so you strapped it on big boy. And I think we are good to go. You're going to have to take Rosemary in the cruiser with you to John's house to get her car. Sure. And so you pull up to the turn for John's house where you would then have to go down his long gravel driveway.
929.56 937.56 speaker1  And sitting by the road is Rosemary's car and she'll get out.
935.56 938.56 speaker2  I believe it's John.
937.56 953.56 speaker1  Yeah, you should be driving. I was a professional waste car driver briefly.
951.56 1000.56 speaker2  Does it give you willpower points? So I still have a negative 20 if I'm at two? Yes. I want to bring cocaine with us. Yeah, I want to have a little baggie of coke on me to, you know, get through the day. I don't want to do it yet since we're not really going to be rolling for, well, I don't know that. No, it's just an hour drive to the city. There's no power nap mechanic? Thank you, Thomas. Tight.
995.56 1003.56 speaker1  I'm writing plus five next to my current hit points and I'll take from there as I get hit.
1001.56 1024.56 speaker2  That gets me all the way up to 13. Okay, so you guys are in the car. Gary, is it?
1023.56 1042.56 speaker1  Harry and Gary. Harry and Gary. Harry and Gary.
1039.56 1046.56 speaker2  Did you take the cell phone jammer with you that you found? Yes, of course. But we didn't turn it on. See, it was already-
1045.56 1059.56 speaker1  No, we didn't take it.
1058.56 1072.56 speaker2  Oh, yeah. It's the map in front of you. Places. Places in contention.
1070.56 1085.56 speaker1  Yeah, let's turn that cell phone jammer off.
1081.56 1096.56 speaker2  And as you make this phone call, Luke, Keith's phone starts to buzz. I answer it. It is a couple voicemails and a text. And let's cut to the phone call with John Pettymore and Harry Clinker.
1095.56 1113.56 speaker1  Bring, bring. Bring, bring. Hey. Hey, Harry. How you doing today? Slow day. Well, I can imagine. Do you know where all the people went?
1110.56 1128.56 speaker0  Yeah, you know, it's crazy. cold anymore.
1125.56 1167.56 speaker1  but usually that's mid-January after the holidays have died down. Oh, same. You got any other working theories? That sounds pretty good right about now, Harry.
1166.56 1171.56 speaker0  Come on down. We'll serve you up real good. Is that Harry? Is that him?
1170.56 1194.56 speaker1  That's Harry. Tell him I said hey.
1187.56 1208.56 speaker0  Because I know, you know, a lot of the people around here were giving it to you pretty good I don't really know what's going on.
1206.56 1277.56 speaker1  The rest are not on us. That's what I'm saying. Those kids, that's bad. That was, that was me and Clark. We didn't mean nothing by it. It was the goo. I mean, but through our negligence. I'm hitting John on the shoulder. Harry, we fought a robot man. I'm just giving wide eyes to John. Yeah, I mean, on top of that, we put a man in a cat's body and then, no, we took a man out of a cat's body into another man's body and put that man into a cat. And look at Chad. Don't worry about it. Oh, wow. Anything?
1272.56 1298.56 speaker0  you, you know, you know, if you're, if you're seeing all that kind of stuff, you, you may want to talk to someone, you know, maybe a, you know, not to get too frank, but maybe a spiritualist of some sort could, could assist you if, if you're dealing with, with people If you need a, if you need a medium, you know, you can always talk to Gary. Yeah.
1297.56 1304.56 speaker1  Is he around?
1301.56 1313.56 speaker0  He didn't come home last night, but he's always around.
1308.56 1358.56 speaker1  I mean, well, don't leave plinkers, but you maybe should be concerned. Your husband may be dead. But weirder. Anything out of, out of the usual? Yeah.
1357.56 1374.56 speaker0  Mildred Mitchell. Well, he's always been into, you know, the occult and, uh, books of that nature.
1373.56 1388.56 speaker1  Yeah. I think actually he's, he's who I meant to call, but this has been a good conversation. It's crazy. It's crazy.
1383.56 1401.56 speaker0  It's like you ever think about like, maybe if you would've called Gary, you'd be talking
1400.56 1402.56 speaker1  to go on.
1401.56 1403.56 speaker2  Yeah.
1402.56 1412.56 speaker1  Okay.
1411.56 1415.56 speaker0  I think he could help you. I think I'm through some of these issues.
1414.56 1418.56 speaker1  I think I'm going to do that. I'm going to have to let you go.
1416.56 1436.56 speaker0  Oh yeah, no, that's fine. It's uh, it's 9am so I guess I shouldn't have expected to be too busy yet.
1435.56 1471.56 speaker1  Uh, okay. Well, I really got to go, Harry. Okay. Harry? Harry, you hang up first.
1468.56 1487.56 speaker2  You just have a one text that you can read pretty quickly. Uh, as you open your phone, it just says, I know. And it's from John Lee Pettymore.
1484.56 1497.56 speaker1  It seems like weeks ago that I made those calls. Uh, are there voicemails?
1491.56 1537.56 speaker2  I try to like hide my phone so that he doesn't know that I'm looking at him and I play the first one. Did you come up with a list?
1535.56 1570.56 speaker1  You got damn bandit. I'm the richest man in the world. I'm going to stick a boot up your ass and then I'm going to fucking marry the turd that Oh, just one. Not important. Guys, I'm sorry. Let's not play a gas station.
1569.56 1574.56 speaker2  I guess we should gather information.
1570.56 1591.56 speaker1  We should tell Drew to just keep us posted, send him a text. If we did need to retcon, now would be the time before we get into the city. So is there anything we are forgetting to bring with us?
1587.56 1609.56 speaker2  We got, did we bring the gun?
1604.56 1621.56 speaker1  I think we'd have to roll new characters if we walk into Marvin Glass's office without the gun. I was so excited. It wouldn't have left your purse in any reason.
1617.56 1647.56 speaker2  Is that the only thing with tubes, that you brought object with tubes?
1643.56 1650.56 speaker1  If people have made it this far in the podcast, they're just like screaming. Yeah, right. Dumb motherfuckers.
1649.56 1659.56 speaker0  No joke.
1654.56 1694.56 speaker1  There was a thread on the Critical Role subreddit and it was somebody who had posted all the loose ends that they've left. And it was only like 10 and I was like, oh fuck, if you did that for us.
1693.56 1695.56 speaker2  That's true.
1694.56 1731.56 speaker1  More balls. You're the worst audience for a juggler. I don't want to have another 20 minute conversation with Gary. It's a good one, guys. Buckle up.
1729.56 1733.56 speaker3  It's fucking nasty, dude.
1731.56 1762.56 speaker1  Yeah, who knows where your ear's been?
1761.56 1778.56 speaker2  Younger model. ...interested if this is... He like rubs his fingers together symbolizing money. Oh, yeah.
1776.56 1801.56 speaker1  I think we could probably work something out. We happen to have $5 million sitting down at the station. Clark starts pulling out his wallet. I got a... Looks like a 20.
1798.56 1814.56 speaker2  So, just figured I'd let you know. If you want to have another phone call with this other person, you can go ahead and throw it on speakerphone.
1813.56 1849.56 speaker1  God damn. Doug, this is why we pay you. Chad is the embodiment of everything Zach has wanted to say to us,
1846.56 1864.56 speaker2  and you hear Gary Daley saying,
1861.56 1871.56 speaker1  Yeah. Well, funny you should say that. Hey, I've actually got us all here on speaker. Boys, you want to say hi? Hey, Gary.
1870.56 1876.56 speaker3  Oh, hello, Clark. Hello, Keith.
1874.56 1901.56 speaker1  You didn't really need to know that. So, first of all, Harry, I think, is a little worried about you. I was worried about you. I wasn't sure we'd get a hold of you.
1899.56 1907.56 speaker2  Just seeing the time now, it completely slipped my mind. I'll absolutely text him. I'll put you on speaker while I do it. Gary, where are you?
1905.56 1922.56 speaker1  Yeah. What'd you say about a witch? Yeah, I'm over...
1921.56 1928.56 speaker3  God, no.
1926.56 1940.56 speaker2  I'm over here trying to work her through it.
1939.56 1941.56 speaker1  Tilly D?
1940.56 1944.56 speaker3  Granddaughter. Granddaughter.
1943.56 1947.56 speaker1  Tilly B. Tilly D.
1946.56 1954.56 speaker3  Hello?
1950.56 1958.56 speaker1  Gary, Harry kind of spilled the beans about your coven or whatever it is.
1957.56 1976.56 speaker3  I don't know. Yeah, we're a sorcerer's guild. Oh, God, no.
1972.56 1977.56 speaker1  Well, all right, Gary, you might have noticed the world's gone to shit.
1976.56 1983.56 speaker3  Yeah, yeah.
1979.56 1989.56 speaker1  Yeah, and obviously something supernatural seems to be involved. You got any theories on that?
1988.56 2006.56 speaker3  Let me run them down for you. Fuck, I said five. Three. Let me run them down for you.
2005.56 2017.56 speaker2  Now, don't get me wrong. He's not like the normal Jesus. No, this is like a cool Jesus.
2016.56 2022.56 speaker3  You know what I mean? Yeah, I think he just knocked them out.
2019.56 2032.56 speaker2  Now, my second theory is that they all left. They all just moved.
2027.56 2043.56 speaker3  The jobs had been drying up for some time, so maybe everyone just decided to leave at the same time. I don't know. Who knows? And then my third theory is that, you know, cults.
2042.56 2061.56 speaker1  So that's the thing. We're not overly familiar with cults, but it seems like you are. Have you seen any in the area or signs of cult activity? I'll ask you to mind your tongue.
2059.56 2074.56 speaker3  Okay, you know what I mean though. They all repeat each other and stuff. Whatever.
2070.56 2089.56 speaker1  Well, John Lee Pettymore is not going to apologize for his faith. Should we just tell him what we think is going on? Well, yeah. You seem like a spooky boy.
2088.56 2092.56 speaker3  So, uh.
2091.56 2101.56 speaker1  Sure. Besides the church, what cults have you seen?
2096.56 2117.56 speaker3  I mean, honestly, that woman Carrie Pages who had the protesters all riled up against you. I think, you know, she might have had something going on. She had a lot of power, you know, with her seat on the city council. And, uh, she was really getting people angry about your lack of attention to detail of the police work and contention.
2115.56 2128.56 speaker1  This is all my fault. I couldn't find her dog. You know what, you're probably right, Clark. But we'll deal with that later. For now, just shoulder the burden of your shame. It's the goddamn case I couldn't close.
2126.56 2140.56 speaker3  And get on with the job.
2137.56 2150.56 speaker1  Well, actually, you did give us that Carrie Pages lead. That was pretty good.
2142.56 2207.56 speaker3  Oh, I don't. She, you know, she keeps staring at this picture that she has and she thinks that it changed somehow. Does that make sense? I'm sorry, Keith. Did I cut you off there? Oh, well, it's just a picture of the founders of the town. And she is dead certain that Silas Cole looks different than he did before. Probably the exact same. But she also is claiming that, you know, did you hear about her granddaughter going missing? So she's yeah.
2202.56 2215.56 speaker1  But you could ask her if you want to describe the difference between the two people.
2209.56 2250.56 speaker3  But so I can't remember exactly what her voice sounds like right now. She's crying a lot and she just keeps saying that he's not as attractive as he used to be used to be far more attractive. And now he's a bit dumber looking, but similar, but stupider. But, you know, that's just crazy because there's no way, obviously, and she's just losing her shit.
2248.56 2263.56 speaker1  I'm going to take you off speaker for just one second.
2260.56 2273.56 speaker2  Ray and who's the girl that died?
2268.56 2280.56 speaker1  I might have to do with the split timelines, but it seems like we kind of know where these people are going now. Go ahead and roll sanity for me. Wow. It's really hard to pass sanity when you have.
2277.56 2302.56 speaker2  Can you give me that blue set or just, yeah, whatever.
2296.56 2327.56 speaker1  If you rolled like it doesn't have to be a positive, but if you roll sixty nine, nothing bad can happen.
2322.56 2352.56 speaker2  And having this realization, you were both, I think, good to go. Right. I mean, we can talk about what you think that means, but it seems like you believe these people are going back in time.
2348.56 2356.56 speaker1  I'll switch him back. Hey, Gary, can you tell me a little bit about your grandfather?
2352.56 2370.56 speaker3  Well, yeah, he's a quiet man. He sang a lot.
2364.56 2405.56 speaker1  Well, I seem to have a memory from my past, but from a time before I could have memories, it was me. And I think Clark is little babies in clinkers. And you were putting some kind of protection on us. And you said your your grandpa was a wizard who had told you about it. And you'd hope you hoped it would work. Did that happen, Gary?
2404.56 2481.56 speaker3  I'm here. And I was to read those pages after tearing them out of the book and then spill blood upon your heads. Now, I know that sounds crazy, but when I did that, the words dance like magic on the page. And they came off like sparks. And it was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. And I did it because my grandpa told me that the three of you, the three of you are the key to everything. Now, I know that sounds extreme, but I did my part. I don't know what your part is, but it's time for you to take care of it. Seems like to me.
2479.56 2511.56 speaker1  It's a spell to give you 100 luck. You finally have been for a 100-inch cop. Better ones.
2510.56 2531.56 speaker3  You do that. I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.
2530.56 2560.56 speaker1  Yeah. Let's do a hang up just in case we haven't. Click. From what, though? Which is nice. Evil, presumably. Okay, I like that. Ninety-one.
2559.56 2564.56 speaker3  Nice.
2563.56 2577.56 speaker2  Jon, you lose one more sanity.
2575.56 2603.56 speaker1  Like, there's no fucking way to roll on this. I've got a 26. Actually, there's literally a one in four chance, but there's not literally a one in four chance, but there's so nearly. So close. I like the part about the words dancing off the page. Yeah, that's pretty cool. It's like a Disney movie.
2600.56 2607.56 speaker4  That he saw light around us and dancing and words? There's no way.
2604.56 2628.56 speaker1  I have seen stranger shit happen these past few days. Yeah, I'll give you that. Okay, well, all I can tell you is they seem real sincere about it in the dream. I didn't dream the part about the magic words, but I did see him put the blood on our heads and he seemed to be pretty into what he was doing.
2624.56 2638.56 speaker4  Is he somebody in our maybe town's history that we would know or anything like that?
2637.56 2640.56 speaker3  Gingerfrid?
2639.56 2663.56 speaker1  Gingerfrid, I like it. We called him Fred. Those who knew him. I guess we're heading there already.
2658.56 2741.56 speaker2  Everything is drab and gray with a sickly green tint to it. The streets are covered in trash and spilled liquids. There is a scent in the air like someone left out cheese in a colostomy bag on every corner. The faces of the buildings are slathered in billboards and the faces of the people bumbling about are bloated and lifeless. In a strange opposition to all this depressive scenery, there are beautiful flowers in every shade and shape, growing in every otherwise empty alleyway and out of many cracks in the sidewalks and roads. Rosemary and her runner car leads you downtown to one of the tallest buildings scraping the putrid sky. This towering building has a granite finish and the reflections wave as you approach, turning down into a small parking garage below this massive stone high rise. Down in this parking garage, there are women in suits touching their earpieces like cliche security guards standing against the wall near the entrance. There's an elevator door in a nearby corner and Rosemary parks, gets out, walks over, and presses the button and it lights up green.
2739.56 2774.56 speaker1  Yeah, I asked an answer. Okay, I get out of the car once we park. I guess we're already out of the car.
2772.56 2786.56 speaker2  Yeah, you might as well.
2783.56 2795.56 speaker4  Or should we bring them with us?
2789.56 2806.56 speaker1  Yeah, we've got, we'll say we're not just a small town PD. We're working with the feds, you know?
2805.56 2823.56 speaker2  Nice. What about your weapons? Okay. Thomas made a dick joke.
2821.56 2844.56 speaker1  My weapons? Is that what you said?
2839.56 2864.56 speaker2  All right, so the four of you get in and the door closes. I hope it works.
2863.56 2869.56 speaker4  Okay.
2868.56 2871.56 speaker2  Are we moving at all?
2870.56 2873.56 speaker1  I touched the wall.
2872.56 2885.56 speaker2  It's a cold wall, guys.
2882.56 2897.56 speaker4  Elevator go. Elevator skyward. Clark jumps up and down. Do I feel a give? It doesn't move at all.
2896.56 2908.56 speaker1  Yep. So I hold the gun up to where cameras might be. I'm like, hey, we got what you're seeking. We seek an audience.
2907.56 2922.56 speaker2  What do we see? All things considered.
2921.56 2926.56 speaker1  12 by 8. What happens when you walk in?
2925.56 2986.56 speaker2  The door closes behind you. In front of you, there is a figure with a massive frame. It is completely gaunt. No muscle or fat. You can just imagine skin stretched across long bones. They're dressed in a fitted black tuxedo, and the spotlight shows off a bright red bowtie, but only reaches to illuminate the lower half of this person's face. The skin on the chin is almost translucent. No hair. Not even a slight shadow of facial hair can be seen on either side of two thin, bright red lips. Actually, there's really no lips at all. Just this candy red lipstick messily encircling a round hole above the sharp see-through chin when the orifice begins to move.
2983.56 2993.56 speaker3  I know who you are. Do you know why you are here?
2992.56 3002.56 speaker1  We think so?
2995.56 3017.56 speaker3  Ferguson Fucking Beans was trying to buy my lost cocaine off a contention police officer. I wasn't going to let it get stolen again. That's why I sent Rosemary to take the money back. Money that is rightfully mine.
3015.56 3064.56 speaker1  You know they're a missing rat. Or one of them is. And the other one's a lunatic now. Who stole the cocaine from you originally? We're here about the gun.
3059.56 3068.56 speaker3  I thought that is why you were here is to bring my money back and pay your pendants.
3066.56 3071.56 speaker4  Rosemary definitely told her she was looking for the gun.
3070.56 3079.56 speaker1  Doug. I need to talk to you real quick.
3078.56 3086.56 speaker2  Alright, Doug.
3084.56 3128.56 speaker1  They confiscated it all. If he asks you any details, we'll interrupt, alright? If you get in over your head, but I need you to say that that money is gone so we can get this conversation on the gun. Okay, yeah, sure. Yeah.
3125.56 3135.56 speaker3  She said that you guys have the money. You brought it here for me.
3133.56 3244.56 speaker1  She said you really wanted that gun. That's what we brought. We're here to talk about your son. Yeah, well, it probably requires some backstories. Something's descended upon contention, the town we're from. And it seems to be spreading and it's not going to be long before it gets to the city. We think we can get him back, but we need your help. We shouldn't be asking for the resources of a criminal organization, I know that. But we don't have any other options. The FBI, you know, Doug here, Chad here is taking us seriously, but his higher-ups aren't. So they're not providing us with resources. If you can help us out, we can get your boy back to you.
3235.56 3249.56 speaker3  And overestimate my love for my pitiful son.
3247.56 3266.56 speaker1  We have made a horrible mistake. It seemed like the one thing you wanted in the world, so we thought we could offer that to you.
3265.56 3279.56 speaker3  I'm sorry.
3276.56 3293.56 speaker2  It seems to be just the four of you and this man.
3289.56 3311.56 speaker3  everyone's favorite fuck-up, to murder your own brother.
3306.56 3399.56 speaker2  Keith, she flips you double birds and smiles as Marvin continues. This woman is shaped like a football with spiky white hair frantically flopping atop a pointy head. She is wearing a large white lab coat and those big chunky evil scientist goggles that evil scientists wear. This pair is wonky, one goggle pointing down and away to accommodate the odd head shape of the wearer. This mad scientist stands tall behind Francis Beans, slowly tapping her long, wobbly fingers against Keith Sneese's collarbones. Francis and the woman behind her back away slowly. And once again, all you can see is the front half of the figure standing before you.
3393.56 3421.56 speaker3  John, I will help you if you prove yourself capable. Clark, I'm sorry you had to be here.
3419.56 3429.56 speaker4  It is closed.
3427.56 3452.56 speaker2  Okay. Well, I mean...
3450.56 3481.56 speaker1  And then I pass out. How convenient. Congratulations on making the mob boss way fucking scarier than I thought it would be.
3472.56 3604.56 speaker2  It is abrasively loud, both from jubilant hollering and pulsing bass that shakes your chest and ribcage with each boom. You have each been crammed into individual cages made entirely of metal bars. These cages are hanging from the ceiling and outline this smoky, dimly lit room. There are three other cages next to your own. They are each inhabited by a person who has also been stripped down to their underwear, just as you have. There is one adult man that you do not recognize, one child, a boy, and also Doug in the body of Agent Chad. The man is massive and barely fits. His muscles bulge and press against the inside of the cage. And the child, the boy, he looks like he could slip right between the metal bars because he is so underfed and sickly looking. About twenty or so fancily clad individuals, each partaking in some sort of vice, be it drinking, smoking, snorting, or all of the above. The crowd is gathered in the middle of the room where there are recliners and couches, papasans and pallets of blankets and pillows. They lounge about and look up at the spectacle hanging above them in the middle of the room. Hanging above the middle of the room is another cage. It is made entirely of plexiglass. Inside, there are two teenagers viciously wrestling. One of them gets the upper hand and moves on top of their opponent. This kid starts beating the absolute shit out of the other. Blood is spraying down onto the crowd below and they fucking love it. You notice that the floor of the fighting cage has little holes everywhere to allow anything to drip down onto the spectators.
3600.56 3604.56 speaker1  It's always there, baby. No light at all.
