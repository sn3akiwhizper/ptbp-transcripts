0	7920	Hello, my talk show audience. It's your host with the most advice, Dr. Wolf the dog.
7920	16080	I always believe in quantity over quality when it comes to talking people through their complex problems.
16080	23040	The more words I say, the more likely you are to believe I know what the hell I'm even talking about.
23040	30400	And I am chatting at you live from 694.2 PTBP as always.
30400	35120	But not as always. We got a different type of episode today.
35120	41520	Well, them boys from pretending to be people ain't seen each other in person in so long.
41520	44560	But today I got a real sweet treat for y'all.
44560	50400	Those five fine fellas use the internet to have a remote conversation with each other.
50400	56080	During this talk, they attempted to answer every single question sent in from y'all.
56080	60240	Our beautiful and charismatic listeners.
60240	63840	I only have remote conversations with everyone.
63840	68080	So I don't know what the big hubbub is over all this stuff.
68080	73760	My voice reaches beyond the stars into other dimensions unknown.
73760	78720	I ain't never had to shake no hands to get my point across.
78720	82480	But I digress. So I can digest.
82480	90640	We here at 694.2 PTBP are proud to present another Q&A for our next episode.
90640	93840	Episode 74 if you're keeping track.
93840	101840	However, this next one will be less focused on the players and more focused on the story and characters.
101840	106960	Wolf knows the expanse of the webs in place from contention to the city,
106960	110880	from the future to the past and all times in between.
110880	118880	Our dear cops are merely cogs wrapped up in something so, so, so much bigger than themselves.
118880	126400	Let's try to take a more objective look at what has unfolded here on 694.2 PTBP
126400	131920	as we head into the final few fables of this, the story of contention.
132720	139280	So head on over to the subreddit at reddit.com slash r slash pretending to be people
139280	143280	and find that Q&A thread to submit your questions.
143280	146560	Understanding the nature of this being a closed game,
146560	150240	we are going to shy away from secrets between players
150240	155680	and focus more on details that have been glossed over or just plain forgotten.
155680	160240	I'm not saying this puzzle doesn't currently have plenty of missing pieces,
160240	166160	just that some of them were forgotten under the table and dragged away by an inquisitive kitty.
166160	167120	Or time.
167120	172960	Or it's just thick fluffy clouds of that good good that are merely fogging some memories.
172960	178720	Either way, now's a good time to get loose, shake it out, maybe do some light stretching
178720	182560	because this next tune, it'll give you the Pringles Tingles.
182640	184480	You will pop.
184480	186400	You will not stop.
186400	194400	Stop me if you've heard this one before, but don't because it is kudzu with no back.
195440	208400	Boom.
212560	227040	Hi, Zach.
227680	229040	What's up, everybody?
229040	229520	What up?
229520	229840	Hello.
230720	232480	I'm in my home and I'm wearing sweatpants.
234080	234720	That's gross.
234720	236400	I'm in my home and I'm wearing jorts.
237440	238560	Ooh, I like that.
238640	242080	And half in for the majority of this ordeal.
242880	244480	Jorts has been the go-to.
244480	246320	Yeah, too hot for sweatpants.
247040	251040	I keep going back and forth between joggers and corduroy short shorts.
252080	253680	Ooh, short shorts.
253680	254560	Short shorts.
254560	256080	How short are these short shorts?
256080	257920	Five inch inseam, baby.
258800	261040	I don't know what that means, but it sounds tight.
265280	266240	It sounds uncomfortable.
266240	270000	It's really nice because you get a breeze.
271120	272560	Oh, under your dong.
273440	273680	Yeah.
274480	274800	Nice.
277920	278480	Yeah, dude.
279120	279440	Yeah.
280720	282160	This is weird breeze.
282160	283200	The recording over the...
284080	285520	I can see all of you.
285520	286240	Windy Wang.
288560	290800	I don't have to side-eye any of you anymore.
290800	294000	I can see you all in one place without really moving my eyes at all.
294960	295440	Stop moving your eyes.
295440	296720	I'm just doing it out of habit.
301280	308720	So today we are taking this experimental trip into remote recording to record a Q&A.
310560	314000	Luke just sent a chat to the group in Zoom.
314000	314560	It says,
317680	322720	My friends, I've missed you terribly over the past few weeks.
324640	327120	It's honestly, I can't read the rest of it because it's going to make me cry.
327120	327920	It doesn't say pee.
332640	333680	Just kidding, it's Luke.
333680	334160	It says pee.
337280	340000	I'm not eloquent enough to write anything more than that.
340000	340800	I knew what you meant.
341840	343920	Yeah, we all remember the vibe.
344720	348560	Hey, this is the wrong time to do it, but I'm going to grab a glass of water and a weed cookie.
350560	351120	All right, bye.
351120	351620	Bye.
353280	355760	And this is the Thomas List Q&A.
355760	357840	He just like doesn't come back for the rest of the time.
359200	360560	He never said he was coming back.
361440	363040	He just said he was going to go grab that stuff.
363040	363920	You know where he's going.
365440	366880	He's going to go sit on his porch.
369440	369760	And talk to his dog.
369760	373040	It's a nice porch to sit on upon.
375040	375440	What else?
375440	378480	Oh, I hope Murphy talks at least once or twice.
379520	380320	Oh, he might.
380320	381840	Thomas is set up in the kitchen.
381840	389040	I can see that because his life-size Ozzy Smith poster is right behind him.
389040	392000	The one that Zach has an intimate relations with.
392000	393520	Oh, look, Thomas is back.
394320	395360	Oh, my God.
395360	396400	Oh, God damn it, Luke.
397840	400880	Luke has the ability to screen share, which is nice.
400880	401600	Yeah, that's good.
402160	404400	I just typed in weed guy and that came up.
404960	405840	It's great.
405840	408960	His fingernails are bad and hurt me to look at.
409920	411120	He's pretty gross.
412720	413920	I'll stop sharing that.
413920	414160	Sorry.
415200	416160	Thanks, dude.
416160	416560	Thank you.
418240	420240	There's definitely won't be the last one though.
420800	423120	Yeah, I still miss you guys.
423920	424480	I do too.
426800	429520	Yeah, I get misty in my downs.
429520	430480	You guys have been watching.
432320	435680	You guys have been watching anything to pass the time.
435680	436400	All the things.
437360	438880	Obviously, Tiger King.
438880	439200	Yeah.
439200	441120	Dude, I just finished it.
441120	442880	I know everyone's talking about it.
442880	444800	It's so crazy.
444800	447600	Yeah, if you haven't watched it yet, you should watch it.
447600	448320	Boy, howdy.
449040	455840	It is so bizarre in a way that I was not even prepared for already knowing how bizarre it was.
455840	461840	Dude, I could not help but laugh out loud when they were showing the pizza that they made at the zoo.
463200	464160	Oh, no.
464640	465140	Yeah.
466080	469920	Imagine if you'd been there and you saw that and you had eaten one of those pizzas.
469920	470160	Right.
473520	477840	So I saw somebody on Facebook was posting about it and one of the comments was like,
477840	480240	dude, you know I got married there, right?
480960	486640	And then he posted a picture and said, Carol Baskins was our officiant.
486640	488160	And it was a picture of them getting married.
488160	488320	No way.
488320	491360	Carol Baskins with the flower crown marrying them.
491920	492880	Yeah, it was wild.
492880	496320	Oh, Chip, I really wish I'd been here for the start of this conversation because
497200	498720	I don't know about you guys personally,
501200	505520	but y'all are fucking wrong about Tiger King and Carol Baskins.
506080	508480	She's the only good one in the whole fucking documentary.
508480	510320	She killed her husband to save those tigers.
512080	516400	And the hero worship of Joe Exotic is really disturbing to me.
517120	518880	Wait, is there hero worship of him?
518880	520160	Oh, yeah, dude.
520160	521920	I agree that that's disturbing to me too.
522320	522960	He's a shithead.
522960	524240	He's a horrible person.
524240	525360	He's a terrible, terrible person.
525360	528320	Watching that fucking wedding scene, I was like,
528320	531840	dude, Danny McBride's whole career was just invalidated by
532720	537120	the most insane piece of nonfiction I've ever seen.
537680	539840	Are the wedding or the funeral?
539840	541360	Sorry, the funeral where he's seen.
541360	545040	He's talking about the kid's balls right in front of his mom,
545040	547760	who was just clearly on so much fucking meth.
548400	549200	Yeah.
549200	551600	Then the wedding immediately afterwards,
551600	554000	where she was one of two people he invited
554000	558080	just so he could post on social media that she was there two months after he died.
558080	558560	Oh, boy.
558560	559920	Yeah, fuck that guy.
559920	562800	I wonder how long until Carol Baskin is in jail.
562800	565200	I think she rubbed him down pretty good and that's sardine oil.
568800	570080	I think the evidence is gone.
570720	574320	Well, guys, we have a crazy amount of questions to get through.
574320	576080	I don't want to do any of these guys.
576080	577280	Let's talk about Tiger King.
577280	579360	This is a Tiger King spoiler cast now.
579360	579860	Exactly.
580400	581600	We're talking Tyg.
581600	584080	Let's do episode by episode.
584080	587280	Honestly, if you can have it spoiled for you by now,
587280	591440	that clearly means that you are not social distancing, you're not staying at home.
593440	598240	Do you like, you've done bad and you deserve to have it spoiled
598240	599680	if you haven't seen it at this point.
599680	604480	Our first question comes from crush36 over on the subreddit.
604480	606800	I think it's K. Ruse36.
606800	607760	It's crush.
608640	609280	K. Cruz.
610080	610720	It's Cruz.
610720	614080	Crux36 is the mod.
614960	617680	He's a dude who started listening a while ago.
617680	623120	He lives on the other side of the country and he is kicking ass modding the subreddit
623120	626880	as well as co-modding the discord for pretending to be people.
626880	627680	Very fun.
627680	633520	Someone changed his name to crush316 in the Google doc.
634480	643920	So crush asks, who would win in a round robin style and championship match thumb wrestling
643920	649280	game you do right after reading this question and then immediately commented, oh fuck, never
649280	650320	mind coronavirus.
650320	651440	Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
652640	655440	Yeah, we can't do it live, but that's an easy one.
655440	656160	Obviously me.
656720	656880	Yeah.
656880	658400	I was going to say Thomas.
658400	658560	Yeah.
658560	660640	I've seen Thomas's thumbs and they frightened me.
660640	662560	I think I would give you guys a run for the money.
662560	665040	I've got tall thumbs and they're double jointed.
665040	666800	I can pop it.
666800	671200	I've got, I've got kind of short, but like stout boys.
671200	673600	I think, I think we'd be an interesting fight, Joe.
673600	674320	Yeah, for sure.
674320	676720	I think Thomas would play a little dirty though.
676720	677200	I would.
677200	681920	I'd, uh, throw some, oh, I was going to say throw some tickles in.
682800	683300	Okay.
683600	689440	The tenacity of Thomas would really pull through, uh, moving, moving right along.
689440	691280	We got that one answered pretty quickly.
691280	692080	Joe, give up.
692560	699600	Uh, so, uh, Jayhawk asks, let's say your character gets a do over.
700240	702640	What one thing would you change?
703280	705520	And then in parentheses row, you can answer twice.
705520	709520	If for some reason the player and the character would want to change different things.
709520	711520	Bonus points of the GM can give an idea.
711520	714080	The GM just say Zach, come on, man.
714080	721200	Uh, if the GM can get an idea, if the Zach, uh, can give an idea of how things would be
721200	724000	different from that point forward, which I acknowledge could be difficult for the sake
724000	725600	of avoiding campaign spoilers or whatever.
725600	726560	That makes sense.
726560	728960	Let's start with, I've got an answer.
728960	734320	Um, I saw this question earlier today and I realized like I had no, I hadn't ever even
734320	741280	thought of that and I felt a little disappointed because people like go so in depth and do
741280	745440	their notes and shit and we just kind of play it once a week.
746080	746800	So I don't know.
746800	748240	I have no idea what I would change.
748240	750720	I'd have to really like what Thomas would change.
750800	751680	I don't think anything.
751680	754960	Cause that's kind of like antithetical to the, to play in the game.
754960	760720	But John Lee Pettymore, uh, would definitely just have fucking booked it with his $5 million
760720	764160	in Coke money and left town, left the state.
764160	765440	He'd be on a beach somewhere.
766640	768720	Like that's good.
768720	769120	Yeah.
769120	769600	Yeah.
769600	771520	That's, that's what he would have done differently.
771520	773440	How long would you have been on that beach though?
773440	778800	Before you realized maybe you weren't on a beach all along and you've been trapped.
778800	779200	I don't know.
780240	781280	He wouldn't fucking care.
783040	784880	How long have we been cops in contention?
785600	792000	Like four days, five days, December 1st to December 6th.
792000	794800	And then back again, who's up next?
794800	795920	I got one.
795920	799200	I have to talk about it cryptically because the other guys don't know about this.
799200	804240	But in this very last arc, I would have gone to a different place when I, when it was,
804240	807760	when it was brought up both Joe and Clark, I think, think that.
807760	810320	Oh, not this, not comp camp.
810320	810560	Sorry.
810560	810720	Yeah.
810720	811440	Not comp comfy.
811440	815840	The one, the one at the, uh, the university, there was an opportunity for Clark to maybe
815840	817440	go to city state university.
818080	818720	Yeah.
818720	820960	Go hit Luke.
820960	821600	His name's Luke.
822480	822720	No.
822720	824080	Does anyone remember their mascot?
827760	832320	Was the miners won it, or we, he was a flower to the mascot.
832320	833280	Oh, that was high school.
833280	834320	That was the contention.
834320	835440	High school is the miners.
835440	837280	Oh, was that, was it a poinsettias?
837280	837600	Yeah.
837680	839600	No, it was the, uh, the other ones, right?
839600	841200	It was the, uh, Edie guys.
841200	842080	Venus flytraps?
842080	842880	Venus flytraps?
842880	843600	Perhaps.
843600	844320	The Edie guys.
844320	844800	Doesn't matter.
847120	848320	Feed me Seymour.
848320	850240	I call my dick the Venus flytrap.
851120	851600	Wow.
852880	853200	Why?
854800	859360	Because it's Chris and Vanny and green for some reason.
859360	860640	Green and it eats flies.
863360	867280	I think if, if Keith was going to change anything, he would have really milked the
867280	872240	wheelchair aspect of it more, um, after he got shot in the foot.
872800	873600	Yeah.
873600	875520	Gone full Ray Gillette.
875520	875840	Yeah.
875840	878320	I would have, uh, I don't remember.
878320	883440	I think I got like a drone or something instead of a, like a military wheelchair.
883440	884720	I would have changed that.
885600	887280	The drone worked really well for me, man.
887280	888000	You should have got one.
889120	893120	I don't remember what my thing was, but yeah.
893120	893360	Yeah.
893360	895120	That didn't work out too well for you.
896080	901520	If anybody listening, uh, wants to send us all in quarantine drones and 3d
901520	909200	printers, that would, I would have a lot more fun if I could fuck around with both
909200	909760	those things.
910800	913600	I've followed subreddits for both of them for years.
914400	915200	Oh, wow.
916480	919040	Wait, how much do you know about dude?
919040	920720	Not as much as I know about 3d printers.
922880	924480	What would you print first?
924480	927760	That's my, well, you've got to, you've got to print benchy, which is the little,
927760	932000	uh, it's this little boat model, this adorable little boat that you print to
932000	936400	like, and it it's for troubleshooting like your initial setup and it's really
936400	940000	easy to tell based like it puts it through all the paces, does a bunch of
940000	942800	different things and you can tell really easily what needs to be fixed.
942800	947680	You do know a lot about 3d printing and people print giant benches and shit all
947680	947920	the time.
947920	948240	It's fun.
949120	952880	Here's a benchy that didn't get printed for the audio format.
952880	954160	No more screen sharing.
954480	955040	Boom.
955040	958000	There you can see some fucked up benches too.
958000	960000	So you can see some good benches here.
960000	960480	Yeah.
960480	961760	3d printing's dope.
961760	965040	What if your 3d printer has thalassophobia?
965040	965680	What is that?
965680	968400	The fear of like the ocean loss.
971360	975360	Anyway, thank you for what would you change about howling with Wolf?
976080	976480	Yeah.
976480	978080	Would Wolf the dog change anything?
978080	980240	I think he's perfect the way he is.
980240	984720	And I think he thinks he's perfect the way he is.
984720	985920	I agree.
985920	986160	Yeah.
986160	986400	Yeah.
986400	986880	I don't know.
986880	989440	There's there's not much to change about perfection, baby.
992560	992880	All right.
992880	993040	Yeah.
993040	996800	I'm going to say the opposite because if I could change anything about
1004320	1006800	would have canceled him after the first episode.
1007280	1015280	No, like as a GM, I constantly look at things and I'm like, Oh, I could have done that better.
1015280	1016960	But that's just like how you grow.
1016960	1021600	And like, as the person who actually like is the only one who knows what's going on.
1022560	1029600	Sometimes, you know, it's like a, it's, it's always like a thought in my mind of like,
1029600	1030480	Oh, I could have changed that.
1030480	1036000	Oh, I could have changed that to do the finish of like, what would change in the campaign
1036000	1038080	if you guys had done the things that you had changed.
1038080	1043440	Thomas, if you would have left with the money, I definitely would have had someone stop you,
1043440	1044320	obviously.
1044320	1047120	And perhaps imprison you likely.
1047120	1047600	Oh yeah.
1047600	1050320	I know that's not a, that's not like a real viable option.
1050320	1053440	That's just what Don Lee anymore would try to do.
1053440	1053680	Yeah.
1053680	1060000	And then they would have had to like, uh, you know, uh, come and capture or not capture.
1060000	1061440	What's the opposite of capturing someone?
1061440	1065040	What's Mario trying to do for save rescue.
1066240	1066560	Bounce.
1068720	1075760	So any of those things, uh, to you, uh, Joe, if you would have gone to a different location,
1076640	1079760	uh, then yes, a lot would have changed.
1079760	1082880	The last arc might not have happened the way it happened.
1082880	1088960	And, uh, I, I actually had completely other plans that I decided to change.
1088960	1095840	Uh, so that, that entire past arc in 26 years ago at calm, comfy campground,
1096080	1097520	was going to be something else.
1097520	1101680	So, um, because Joe went to a different place.
1101680	1102320	Yeah.
1102320	1102800	Wow.
1105840	1112720	Luke, uh, if you would have worked the wheelchair angle more, I would have made sure that
1112720	1113840	Contingent had ramps.
1115600	1116800	Contingent had ramps.
1116800	1117840	Is that what you said?
1117840	1118080	Yeah.
1118080	1121520	I would just would have made sure that Contingent was like, uh, compliant.
1121520	1121840	It is.
1121840	1122320	It does.
1122320	1123200	Disability friendly.
1123200	1123600	Oh yeah.
1123600	1124000	Of course.
1124000	1126880	Like all the businesses, they're super chill about that.
1126880	1132400	So, uh, Jayhawk Inc also asked what made you choose the specifics for this Delta green
1132400	1135840	game and went on to say, you're playing a group of police officers who are stumbling
1135840	1140720	into mythos rather than a group of seasoned agents on a sanctioned DG mission or a mix
1140720	1145600	of seasoned rookie agents or agents based on expertise agents in general, right?
1145600	1149440	So really there's a broad scale in how much Delta green lore and specifics you use and
1149440	1151040	how much you deviate and homebrew.
1151040	1156160	And I'm curious how we ended up in contention PD as opposed to anything else that could
1156160	1157280	have been, you know?
1157280	1163040	So why did we start as novices to the mythos, not seasoned professionals like you do in
1163040	1164640	a lot of Delta green scenarios?
1164640	1165280	Exactly.
1165280	1171440	And why are we playing in like a place we made up, I guess maybe in like a sandbox town
1171440	1175200	instead of like a mission, like where you are sent somewhere?
1175200	1180240	Well, I'll answer part of it cause I remember you, cause the character stuff obviously I
1180240	1185600	can't help with, but I remember you saying that the, the idea of the small town thing
1185600	1188640	was always like really appealing to you.
1188640	1194720	And we kind of all liked those stories being from the Midwest and having been to some very
1194720	1200240	small towns in our lifetime where just like weird crap kind of happens all the time, but
1200240	1205600	taking it to like the super extreme and how would a small town react to like the supernatural
1205600	1209040	elements and stuff like is just, I think that's just fun.
1209040	1209440	Yeah.
1209440	1213440	And I've wanted to run a sandbox for a while, like right, right.
1213440	1214480	And run a sandbox.
1215040	1220800	So that definitely had some to do with it, but also we just like, I think we came together
1220800	1222000	with that idea, right?
1222000	1226320	Like it was already going to be a small town when we met for the session zero.
1226320	1227200	I think so.
1227200	1228640	And I don't know.
1228640	1230720	I personally think it's a lot more fun this way.
1231440	1232320	Yeah, I agree.
1232320	1234880	Delta green missions are great.
1234880	1238160	They're just not really how we've played campaigns in the past.
1238800	1244320	And we, so, Oh, that's something we can say that this is pretty much how we did two full
1244320	1249280	like year long campaigns just around our table and kind of a little bit sandboxy.
1249280	1252960	Not, we didn't have a whole made up town or anything, but sure.
1252960	1253280	Yeah.
1253280	1259440	It was basically just like, I would take pre-written adventures from either call of Cthulhu or
1259440	1260480	Delta green.
1260480	1267440	And then I would mess with them and then make little like connecting scenarios to play in
1267440	1272000	between to kind of make the overall thread of whatever story we were telling connect
1272000	1274560	to itself, spiderwebs and all that.
1275280	1280240	I also think having a stumble into mysteries is fun from an audience standpoint that they're
1280240	1285200	learning and freaking out about things along with us that you maybe not, you maybe wouldn't
1285200	1289600	get if our characters were so hardened that none of this was new to them.
1289600	1293120	It's kind of fun that we're freaking out with weird shit in character and out.
1293120	1293600	Agreed.
1293600	1300320	I also love introducing the lore of Delta green, like whatever bits I choose to use
1300320	1301840	from the actual Delta green.
1301840	1308080	And then the ones that I make up and add, I love like sneaking that in slowly to a story
1308080	1310560	of people who are relatively normal.
1310560	1312960	I mean, it's, it's also fun.
1312960	1319680	This is it's fun as a player because I personally have never done any research about Delta green
1319680	1323600	lore or it's fun to, I've read a bunch of Lovecraft.
1324240	1330320	So, you know, I'm obviously familiar with Lovecraftian themes, but I don't own a Delta
1330320	1331600	green handbook or anything.
1332480	1333280	Keep it that way.
1336720	1338640	Have we just been running the default scenario?
1341600	1343760	Welcome to conviction USA.
1345680	1347360	A small town like any other.
1347360	1349840	Everyone on the threads are like, we don't play that one.
1349840	1351040	It's not very well written.
1353840	1359120	I actually wanted to say one time I played a Delta green mission and because someone
1359120	1364480	was like, so up to date with a lot of the Delta green lore, some weird monster of some
1364480	1369520	kind was spawning somewhere and they were already like, Oh, I know what this thing is.
1369520	1374560	But it was weird that their character would like, their character shouldn't know that.
1374640	1379840	And so it became this weird thing of them being like, Oh, I have to like pretend I don't
1379840	1380480	know this.
1380480	1380880	I don't know.
1380880	1385280	It's kind of more interesting to use the rule set, but then kind of be able to insert your
1385280	1387120	own fiction within it.
1387120	1391200	And then that way there's not people who are like, Oh, I know what's coming.
1391200	1392400	Like, yeah.
1392400	1395600	And I guess it's, that's not really a problem if you're playing somebody who is supposed
1395600	1398240	to be a seasoned Delta green agent, right?
1398240	1398880	Yeah, totally.
1398880	1403200	But their, their character was like just a small town, like park ranger or something.
1403680	1408160	Which I just, I think it's way more fun to play normal people exposed to this than it
1408160	1408720	is to.
1408720	1410320	Yes, I think so too.
1410320	1416400	One of my favorite ways to play is as a Delta green agent who has gone on one mission before
1416960	1424400	and has like one experience, but that's the interesting thing about a seasoned quote unquote
1424400	1430640	Delta green agent means they've probably like been doing it for not that long and not been
1430640	1436320	on very mission, very many missions, because if they had, they're probably loosey goosey
1436320	1438400	or a deady wetty.
1438400	1449120	And so as this virus ravages our nation, a lot more people are going to wind up deady
1449120	1449520	wetty.
1449520	1453680	So let's try to be respectful.
1454480	1457600	We've got another question here from feared reindeer.
1457600	1463280	It says, if you each had to give one bit of advice to someone, what would it be?
1464400	1464960	Don't listen to me.
1464960	1469280	First off, I just want to say, yeah, none of us are in any position to give any advice.
1469280	1470080	I think I am.
1473760	1476800	No, just be patient with everyone you meet.
1476800	1482960	Try to be, if they don't, if they do things that seem irrational or not understandable
1482960	1486080	to you, just know they're probably coming from a really different place.
1486080	1487680	And yeah, just don't be a Dick.
1487680	1496800	Don't, I don't like people who get like angry, like my stepdad perception is reality.
1496800	1497300	Mark.
1499120	1500160	I have a good one.
1500160	1506320	If, if some, unless someone else wants to step up, if you're already talking, just like,
1506320	1507840	stop interrupting me.
1510480	1515200	My advice is so like I was saying, yeah, yeah.
1515280	1516240	That's what I'm saying.
1516240	1517760	Justin, this is a year.
1519280	1519920	He's mean.
1520800	1522240	Hey, do you see what's happened?
1526800	1527280	You know what?
1527280	1529440	It's worth it to break free of your oppressive.
1532880	1533520	My advice.
1533520	1542000	This is something I said in, in the discord is, uh, is nevermind.
1542000	1542480	I forgot.
1545280	1548880	It was a bitches get paid.
1548880	1550640	He realized that he probably shouldn't say it.
1551440	1551840	Yeah.
1551840	1552720	It's not cool.
1552720	1553440	Cause he doesn't.
1556320	1557040	Oh my God.
1557040	1558160	I'm a fucking idiot.
1559760	1562960	I was really ready for some shit.
1562960	1565520	Like I was ready to be enlightened.
1565520	1565920	Luke.
1565920	1568720	Do you have any advice for the listeners at home?
1568720	1570560	Find a therapist you like.
1570560	1571200	Yup.
1571200	1572000	It helps.
1572000	1572400	Nice.
1572400	1573360	Mine's Mark.
1573360	1574160	Shout out to Mark.
1574800	1576000	Oh, nice.
1578000	1580400	Thomas's stepdad is Luke's therapist.
1584240	1585840	Uh, I yelled marker earlier.
1585840	1591760	Uh, so my, what's your advice?
1594320	1595600	My advice.
1595600	1596240	Oh fuck.
1596240	1597360	Am I going to Justin it?
1597360	1598240	I remembered mine.
1599200	1600240	Perfect timing.
1600240	1601440	Do you want me to go?
1601440	1602160	Yes.
1602160	1602880	Okay.
1602880	1607200	So mine is a, it's kind of like a mindfulness based thing, which is, uh,
1607200	1612160	take control of what you can and what you can control, make plans of action,
1612160	1617680	begrudgingly accept what you can't control and move on and be kind like Thomas said.
1618320	1618640	Yeah.
1618640	1623520	Everyone like, just be kind to each other, no matter what the haps are.
1623520	1627360	Unless someone's being a real big piece of shit, then you can be a dick to them.
1627600	1633920	But like the average person, you don't know what's, you don't know what's going
1633920	1634640	on in their life.
1634640	1636320	Like we do know what's going on with Zach.
1636320	1637760	He's just mean and malicious.
1637760	1638260	Yeah.
1640160	1641360	We met his nice parents.
1641360	1642800	We know it's just genetic.
1642800	1643300	Yeah.
1644400	1647040	I mean, not, we know it's, yeah.
1647040	1649520	Like you got it from a grandpa or something.
1649520	1651360	They definitely nurtured you, right?
1651360	1653920	Oh, my grandpa's a dick.
1653920	1654320	Yeah.
1654320	1654720	Like you.
1657600	1659360	It's good to see you guys.
1659360	1659600	Yeah.
1659600	1661200	It's really good to hang out again.
1664400	1666000	But yeah, I want to amend my answer.
1666000	1669680	Don't be be patient with everyone except for Zach.
1672800	1673520	Oh man.
1674320	1678480	My advice is to, uh, to ask questions.
1678480	1679200	Good one.
1679200	1680400	Like, what did you touch?
1682880	1683680	What's that smell?
1684640	1686240	I like, uh, what's wrong with you?
1686960	1691360	When I was in high school, I think like, is your face stuck like that?
1692560	1697120	When I was in high school, my face was stuck in this really, like I thought
1697120	1700800	attractive position, but that's just because I looked in the mirror all the
1700800	1703600	time and they say, the more you see something, the more attractive you
1703600	1710560	think it is, uh, which I'm finding in marriage, but no, it's, uh, it's,
1710560	1715040	it's just a, like when someone like talks about a band and asks if you've
1715040	1719360	heard of them and you like have heard of them, but you haven't listened to
1719360	1725440	them, like, just ask, I don't know, like, don't act like you know everything.
1725440	1725680	Okay.
1725680	1727440	So that's, that's wrong.
1727440	1728720	That's wrong listeners.
1728720	1731760	You should, you should be like, oh yeah, I've heard of them.
1731760	1732800	I've heard of them.
1732800	1734080	I prefer their earlier stuff.
1736080	1739040	Just like ask people questions and learn more.
1739040	1739440	Nice.
1739440	1739920	I like that.
1739920	1740560	Good advice.
1741120	1743680	Or front like, you know,
1746000	1746480	shut up.
1748240	1749440	Front it till you crown it.
1752160	1752880	That was good.
1752880	1753440	I liked it.
1753440	1754160	Joe.
1754160	1754880	Hey Joe.
1754880	1755200	Yeah.
1755200	1755920	Hey Joe.
1755920	1756240	Hi.
1756240	1758960	Give us some really good advice and don't embarrass yourself.
1758960	1759840	Like Zach just did.
1761920	1762800	Fin for yourself.
1768000	1768800	You heard it here.
1769920	1773840	Fucking number one, numero uno, baby.
1774560	1776000	Figure it out for number one.
1776000	1776960	It's Joe Terry.
1778560	1782480	I absolutely adore this next question.
1783200	1787440	We got it on Twitter and it's from at crane song.
1787440	1793440	And it says, if contention had continued to be boring and normal and the boys had
1793440	1798800	just kept on their normal person trajectory, what would their future have looked like?
1798800	1801600	Would they marry, have kids retire early?
1801600	1805200	And then they also, they said, I humbly offer unto you this blep.
1805200	1809360	And they had a nice picture of the cat with a little blep and that was very nice.
1809360	1810240	Cute cat.
1810240	1816640	Clark would definitely still be at the station and he would be eternally waiting for Maggie
1816640	1821120	to vacate her position position so that he could take over.
1821120	1825680	But I foresee it being like a Prince Charles thing that he, she would be there forever
1825680	1828400	and he would grow old and probably never get his goal.
1829760	1830720	That sounds right.
1830720	1831680	That's so sad.
1832400	1835360	That might be sadder than what actually happens to Clark Bishop.
1838320	1840320	Oh no, he's definitely living his best life now.
1842480	1846960	I think also something Clark would be doing in five years is probably arresting John Lee
1846960	1854320	Pettymore for like either John Lee Pettymore would have devolved into like the same
1854320	1859920	criminality he got up to in the podcast or he would have really gone hard on the cop
1859920	1863840	thing, gotten into some pretty questionable Facebook groups.
1863840	1864960	Oh God.
1864960	1865440	Yeah.
1865440	1868960	It's not a, it's not a bright, uh, it doesn't look good.
1868960	1871920	Let's hope John Lee Pettymore stays the path.
1871920	1876720	You know those people who are like, who hate AOC, but also clearly are like obsessed with
1876720	1876960	her?
1880240	1883760	I don't go to that part of the internet or at least I try to stay away from it.
1883760	1886800	I go to the parts of the internet that make fun of that part of the internet.
1887520	1888080	There you go.
1889040	1893280	Do you think John Lee Pettymore would have like a bunch of kids with multiple women or
1893280	1896000	is he a little more like, I'm a one woman kind of guy, man?
1896880	1897680	I really don't know.
1898560	1905760	I think, I think he, uh, I met a guy once who was, um, extremely just like Missouri
1905760	1907360	in a lot of ways, this electrician.
1908000	1912160	And we were talking when I was like 23 and he was like, so you're not going to get like
1912160	1914160	married or have kids anytime soon.
1914240	1918240	And I was like, yeah, I never, uh, I never really wanted kids.
1918240	1921520	And he like stopped and he was like, Oh, huh.
1922320	1924800	I never even thought about not having kids.
1928800	1931600	I think John might've been a little bit like that.
1932400	1934080	He's just like, yeah, it's what you do, right?
1934080	1934880	Like, sure.
1934880	1935600	That's good.
1935600	1936720	What's Keith's story?
1936720	1939840	Keith, uh, works there for about a year.
1939840	1940960	Gets fired.
1940960	1947920	Um, can't, uh, hold down a job eventually becomes homeless until his brother finally
1947920	1949120	takes pity on him.
1949120	1951040	Um, lets him live at his house.
1951760	1961200	And then Keith becomes like a manager of some small part of the beans Corp and probably
1961200	1962720	kills his brother at some point.
1962720	1970560	Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if, if, if he like hired you as security or something
1970560	1973440	and then you accidentally shot him in the head.
1973440	1976880	I think that's like what happened to John F.
1976880	1977440	Kennedy.
1978320	1978820	Yeah.
1979440	1984480	There's a 30 rock bit where Tracy says he knows his dad is dead because he's a celebrity.
1985360	1990640	And if his dad wasn't dead, he'd be paying him 250,000 dollars a year to mow his lawn.
1992880	1995520	That's such a good job.
1995520	2001520	So yeah, Keith, Keith is, uh, probably better, better off with the shit going down now.
2001520	2003760	Drew Andrews, I think would eventually.
2004400	2004640	Okay.
2004640	2006160	First of all, no one asked Zach.
2007760	2009120	Oh man, did they not?
2010480	2011520	That's another question.
2013200	2014080	Tell us about Drew.
2014080	2014800	I'm just being a dick.
2014800	2016320	There's another Drew Andrews question.
2016320	2017520	No, you're right.
2017520	2019120	It didn't, it didn't ask.
2019120	2020240	Yeah, not now.
2020240	2021600	Wait your turns.
2022880	2023440	I'm sorry.
2027360	2028880	Guys, I feel so bad.
2031200	2032000	Say it like Drew.
2033040	2036480	Guys, I feel so, I mean, contention police office.
2036480	2037760	This is Drew speaking.
2037760	2039280	Oh, I love him.
2039280	2040640	Yes, that makes me miss that.
2040640	2041360	I love Drew.
2041920	2042480	He's dead.
2047840	2049360	We got another question here.
2049440	2052960	That dude, no one knows says, is there a PO box?
2052960	2054160	We can send you beer.
2054720	2056480	We'll be setting one up shortly.
2056480	2058240	Yeah, just because you said that.
2059040	2059840	Hey, shut the fuck up.
2063280	2065120	And we got another one.
2065120	2066720	When are you coming out with merch?
2066720	2068320	Cause I need that shit.
2068320	2070720	That is also very soon.
2070720	2076160	We've got some really cool shit lined up and I'm very excited for you all to see it.
2076160	2077680	Every size of cock ring.
2080000	2084480	The colostomy bags with, with the logo on them.
2084480	2085520	Pet caskets.
2087600	2090560	Dude, pet caskets is so good.
2090560	2090960	Yeah, I know.
2090960	2095600	That's why we're going to be shipping them out pretty soon to everybody's who's already
2095600	2096880	pre-ordered a pet casket.
2098000	2099040	Which is most of you.
2099040	2103920	Thank you so much for going to my best friend died.
2103920	2104800	What do I do now?
2104800	2105840	Dot com.
2105840	2107440	Thankfully we were able to get that.
2109360	2112560	Uh, so yeah, that'll be out soon.
2112560	2113520	I'm really excited about it.
2114080	2119680	What is your favorite system for quick one shot slash introducing people to RP?
2120480	2124320	I mean just right off the bat, Delta green, Delta green, and it's the best one.
2124320	2128080	And it's, I think the best way to introduce people to role playing.
2128080	2129680	It's super easy to play.
2129680	2130880	Super intriguing.
2130880	2132080	I fucking love it.
2132080	2132480	I agree.
2132480	2133040	A hundred percent.
2133040	2136960	And the one shots are just always a fucking blast and you can get them done in three or
2136960	2138640	four hours usually.
2138640	2139040	Yeah.
2139040	2139920	What about you, Justin?
2139920	2144160	Uh, don't do what I did, which is try and learn an entire new system you've never played
2144160	2148000	and then try and run brand new people through it while you're also learning it.
2148000	2150800	Cause I tried that with dungeon world and it became a mess.
2150800	2155760	Even though dungeon world seems super dope, having all new people with like a more complex
2155760	2160320	system than like others, like the dice rolling mechanic was really easy, but like all the
2160320	2164000	other character building and other stuff was what is dungeon world.
2164000	2168720	How's it different from like D and D you, uh, gosh, I haven't played it in so long,
2168720	2173440	but the crux of it is like most roles are accomplished with two D six if I remember
2173440	2173760	right.
2173760	2176720	And a third of them are you get to do what you want.
2176720	2182080	A third are you kind of succeed, but I get, but I get to take something from you.
2182080	2185680	And then the other third are like you fail, which I thought was really cool, but it can
2185680	2186640	be a little confusing.
2186640	2190960	I think Delta green is really good for most people to start on.
2190960	2192160	It's easy to wrap your head around.
2192160	2193200	It's just percentages.
2193200	2196560	So you kind of get an idea right off the bat, how good or bad at a thing you are.
2196560	2198240	So you can kind of role play that a little easier.
2198240	2200320	It's easier to build the characters too.
2200320	2202240	I feel like, Oh, absolutely.
2202240	2204080	I think Delta green's like awesome.
2204080	2206400	I'm about to probably run some friends through it.
2206400	2208880	And I was like, this seems like the way to go.
2209840	2210320	Yeah.
2210320	2219200	I also think that the mechanics of a game are always the part I care least about and
2219200	2222960	the mechanics get in the way as little as possible.
2222960	2223520	Exactly.
2223520	2224800	That's my thing too.
2224800	2228960	I want to tell a cool story with my buds, not play a tactics.
2228960	2229360	I'm sorry.
2229360	2231440	You want to tell a cool story with your butt?
2233200	2234640	Dude, you fucking got me.
2237440	2237840	Sorry.
2237840	2238240	I'm real.
2238240	2238720	I'm real.
2238720	2239680	COVID caddy.
2239680	2240080	I'm real.
2243040	2244640	I'm real quarantine caddy tonight.
2244640	2245840	Quarantine caddy.
2246480	2252080	Final question from that dude no one knows is will drew ever get his teeth fixed and
2252080	2254640	be as successful as his paramedic cousin?
2254960	2258320	Oh, yes and no.
2258320	2260480	He's just as successful in our hearts.
2261200	2265440	I mean, he is not good at what he does, but he's a good friend.
2268320	2269760	He was always there for me.
2269760	2271280	He was actually, yeah, he's fantastic.
2271280	2273360	I made $5 million with that motherfucker.
2276560	2278000	So he could get his tooth fixed.
2278000	2279280	That's not an issue.
2279840	2282160	Our next question is
2282160	2286240	is from room service nachos.
2286240	2287040	That's me.
2287040	2290160	That's like, that sounds familiar.
2291600	2292240	Yes.
2292240	2293440	What's in my pocket?
2293440	2294160	Oh, it's a ring.
2294880	2296160	I've read that book.
2296160	2297600	Yeah, it's pretty good.
2297600	2306720	Harry Potter number three, I think number three, Harry Potter number three, Harry Potter
2306720	2307440	and Luke.
2307440	2308400	What's in your pocket right now?
2308960	2309840	Let's see wallet.
2309840	2310560	I'm calling wallet.
2311040	2312560	Like just a bunch of condoms.
2314560	2314880	Fuck.
2314880	2318240	If we'd actually been playing, we could have super one.
2318240	2319360	That would have been really easy.
2319360	2321760	Yeah, that would have been my passport.
2324400	2326240	Are you all like ready to evacuate?
2327120	2329120	Just in case, baby.
2329120	2330320	Some people have go bags.
2330320	2331280	He has go pants.
2333840	2337200	And a salt rifle tweezers tweezers.
2337200	2338800	Now you take care of that unibrow.
2338800	2341680	I know I was picking nose hairs out of my nose.
2341680	2343680	Oh, you pull them.
2343680	2344640	Yeah, I don't have many.
2344640	2345920	So I just do it.
2345920	2347200	It's kind of fun to pull them.
2347200	2349120	If you're a pervert like me and Luca.
2352400	2353680	It makes me sneeze.
2353680	2354960	I know I like it though.
2354960	2355760	Oh, okay.
2355760	2356000	Yeah.
2357040	2359200	I can't come unless I sneeze.
2359200	2360240	Oh, there it is.
2362320	2363040	Dude, that.
2363040	2363280	Okay.
2363280	2369440	There was this dumb ass like book of facts that was given to me for Christmas one year.
2369440	2370640	This is in there too.
2370640	2373040	And it's holding up his driver's license.
2373040	2374160	Go ahead and screen cap that.
2374160	2374720	Put it on there.
2374720	2375440	Audio.
2375440	2376800	Audio medium.
2376800	2381760	So in this book of facts, it was like your brain can't tell the difference between
2381760	2383200	sneezing and an orgasm.
2384560	2386160	And it's like my brain can.
2386160	2387200	Obviously it can.
2387840	2395120	Obviously you're never like, oh, I've got to go change my pants when you sneeze.
2395120	2401120	It was always like a rumor going around when we were kids that a sneeze was an eighth of
2401120	2402160	an orgasm.
2402160	2402400	Yeah.
2403120	2408240	And so if you sneeze twice, you'd be like, oh, a quarter of an orgasm.
2409440	2409920	Yeah.
2409920	2414720	And then if you got the elusive eight in a row sneeze, then you had to leave.
2414720	2415440	You completed.
2415440	2416080	Yeah.
2416080	2416720	That's different.
2416720	2419040	Like eight sneezes in a row sucks.
2419040	2419680	Oh God.
2419680	2420560	Can you imagine?
2420560	2427680	I think the closest thing you can get is like, you can get, I think like a third of an orgasm
2427680	2430000	is like taking a really long, satisfying piss.
2430560	2430960	Ooh.
2430960	2431520	Yeah.
2431520	2434240	Oh, after a movie or something, maybe a quarter.
2434240	2435200	What about just, all right.
2435200	2436480	You got another question here.
2439120	2439280	Yeah.
2439280	2441280	If you push your pants twice, you're halfway there.
2443120	2444320	I'm living on a prayer.
2444320	2444640	Okay.
2444640	2450000	Nothing for asks is Alan Grimes based on Walter Mathau.
2450000	2457280	So here's the thing I really fucked up because Alan Grimes was originally based on Walter
2457280	2459040	Cronkite and Walter Mathau.
2459600	2466400	But then like, as Thomas pointed out, definitely turned into, um, Nixon and Nixon and Mathau.
2468400	2468720	Yeah.
2469600	2475360	But that is why I kept calling him Walter, even though Luke's character's name was Walter
2475360	2481120	because I had set him up as a Walter in my head and then made his son or not son's name
2481120	2482080	Walter.
2482080	2482560	Yeah.
2482560	2485200	That was a silly, silly call on my end.
2486640	2488080	They got another question here.
2488080	2488960	I liked this one a lot.
2488960	2494240	Each person name and describe their favorite tourist attraction in or around Springfield,
2494240	2496240	Missouri difficulty level.
2496240	2499200	You may not give the same answer as someone else.
2499200	2501600	Ooh, I'm going to go for the obvious one then.
2501600	2503680	Cause I think it's legitimately awesome.
2503680	2507920	The new aquarium in town is legitimately world-class.
2507920	2509680	It's uh, it's the best pro guy.
2510720	2511520	Johnny Morris.
2513760	2515760	Wonders of wildlife aquarium.
2515760	2516640	Still haven't been.
2516640	2517520	I've been twice.
2517520	2518240	It's really cool.
2518240	2519360	Go to the aquarium.
2519360	2521280	Don't go to the other part.
2521280	2523280	Which is animal trophies.
2524080	2524480	Yeah.
2524480	2527360	It's like under the guise of conservation.
2527360	2531360	It's just like, look who all these like rich fucks have shot.
2531360	2531680	Yeah.
2531680	2538800	And literally the signs next to the giraffes or the elephants say this animal was taken
2538800	2545920	by and then the name and then sometimes there's pictures of like Johnny Morris is like shit
2545920	2549040	eating nephews, like next to dead rhinos and shit.
2549040	2550480	And it's like, what the fuck?
2550480	2550720	Yeah.
2550720	2552320	It's really, it's really creepy.
2552320	2554640	But the aquarium is great.
2554640	2556960	The aquarium is super duper dope.
2556960	2563040	You should go to a Casper's when you, I'll avoid the, the like obvious tour tourist traps,
2563040	2564960	but you should go to Casper's.
2564960	2570720	It's this cool old, uh, burger joint in a, uh, in an authentic old Quonset hut.
2570720	2574080	That's a cool part of like Springfield LGBT history.
2574080	2576800	And they have dope burgers.
2576800	2580320	Wait, I didn't know it was, uh, I didn't know it was an ally.
2580960	2586000	Uh, the guy who ran it forever, uh, from like the seventies until the early two thousands
2586000	2587360	or even a little later.
2587360	2588160	Oh, that's sick.
2588160	2591760	Me and my dad used to go there for lunch every week and get Frito pie.
2591760	2592080	Yeah.
2592080	2594000	The chili there was dope.
2594000	2597600	I do like how they serve the chili in the bowls where it's like totally overflowing.
2597600	2598160	Yes.
2598160	2602080	It's completely overflowing.
2602080	2603280	Like slopped in there.
2603280	2605600	I have one also food adjacent.
2606160	2608480	Try some cashew chicken when you come here.
2608480	2608880	Yeah.
2608880	2610240	Yeah, we invented it.
2610240	2611280	Motherfuckers.
2611280	2612000	It's really good.
2612000	2616880	If you just want some weird fried chicken breast or thigh or whatever battered and with
2616880	2621840	just like a salty soy sauce over it, it's decadent and delicious.
2621840	2626560	If you go to a Chinese place near your place and you ask for cashew chicken, you will not
2626560	2628000	get what we're talking about.
2628000	2632240	Hers is very specific to Springfield and it's, yeah, it's like fried chicken and gravy.
2632240	2632720	It's great.
2634880	2636320	It's a nap maker.
2636320	2641120	But you can pretty much go to any good, cheap Chinese place in Springfield and get a pretty
2641120	2642880	good version of it, which is kind of fun.
2642880	2644320	For $4.50.
2644320	2644720	Yeah.
2644720	2647280	$4.50, a little side of rice and an egg roll.
2647280	2651360	But there's really good places too if you want to actually get a little more.
2651360	2653600	It's on the end that had the $4.50 forever.
2653600	2654160	Yeah.
2654160	2655120	What's your go-to Chinese place?
2655120	2657920	I drove by the other day and they're like $5, $5.50 now.
2657920	2658880	What the fuck?
2658880	2659360	I know.
2659360	2659840	Damn it.
2661200	2663520	What's your go-to Chinese in Springfield?
2664080	2672800	My favorite tourist attraction in and or around Springfield is not a Chinese food place, but
2672800	2676720	it is exotic animal paradise.
2676720	2677840	Oh yeah, dude.
2678880	2681360	Well, which hasn't been called that for years, right?
2681360	2682560	And is it even still open?
2682560	2683360	I don't think so.
2683360	2684880	Wait, is that the one where you drive through?
2684880	2687920	It is open and you do drive through it.
2687920	2691120	I think it's called Wild Animal Safari.
2692080	2699120	The reason that it's my favorite, besides the animal abuse, is on a real note, it is
2699840	2701920	probably some fucked up shit going on.
2701920	2706240	But when I was a kid, I went there a lot and I have a lot of really good memories with
2706240	2712240	my grandpa who passed away, who is the only grandparent who passed away when I was younger
2712240	2717120	and therefore holds a really nice memory in my heart because I didn't get to find out
2717120	2718320	that he was probably racist.
2718960	2725520	And so all my memories of him are pure and he would always bring leather gloves with
2725520	2732320	him so that he could unroll the window and pet the ostriches who would then peck at his
2732320	2734960	hands and grab onto his gloves.
2734960	2736080	And it was very fun.
2736640	2741680	One of my favorite memories growing up was driving through there and him rolling the
2741680	2747360	window all the way down and leaning the seat back in a buffalo put its entire head inside
2747360	2752800	the minivan and started licking the ceiling and my grandma was just like freaking out.
2752800	2753840	It was so funny.
2755200	2755840	That's dope.
2756720	2759120	Don't go there though if you come to Springfield.
2759120	2763040	It's not as, well actually I haven't been, I haven't even seen the place in like 15 years
2763040	2766480	so I can't, I don't know if the new owners are like Joe Exotic bad or not.
2766480	2768160	They do have two tigers.
2768160	2772400	Back in the day it was not like Joe Exotic's weird fucking zoo.
2772400	2774160	They were like roaming around.
2774160	2779040	There's also a real zoo where you can go and see the animals and they're well taken care of.
2779040	2782160	Yeah they have like a medical team that takes care of them all at the ad.
2782960	2784960	And the peacocks running around.
2784960	2786880	All right we've got, did anyone?
2786880	2787440	Hold on.
2787440	2788000	Hold on Luke.
2788000	2788800	Yeah we've got more.
2790080	2792400	Fantastic Caverns is pretty cool.
2792400	2792880	Oh hell yeah.
2793760	2796640	Silver Dollar City, not really Springfield but close enough.
2796640	2797920	It's so dope.
2797920	2800240	Food is great and you gotta ride the rides.
2800240	2801920	Are you a roller coaster guy?
2801920	2803920	You gotta ride the rides or they won't let you eat the food.
2804160	2807120	Yeah you have to throw, do the loops and throw.
2807120	2810000	It's always fun to throw up on the people behind you as a goof.
2810560	2811280	As a goof.
2811280	2812320	As a good goof.
2812320	2813040	I goofed you.
2814720	2820320	We went there, Zach and I and our and our partners went there last year on acid and
2820320	2824960	had a really fun time watching the old-fashioned glass blowers.
2826640	2827920	That would be incredible.
2827920	2830880	I was melting alongside the glass.
2830880	2831600	It was really chill.
2832560	2834960	I still have a knife that I bought when I was a kid.
2834960	2837040	Like a pocket knife that was made there.
2837040	2838080	It's pretty cool.
2838080	2845600	We then took Thomas on a roller coaster that you sit in and it goes around like a like
2845600	2850960	a carnival ride does but then it also goes on a roller coaster track so you're going
2850960	2855040	spinning around while you're going upside down and doing corkscrews.
2855040	2859040	Right like the car you're in itself like just spins all around on its axis.
2859920	2861120	Which is my favorite.
2862640	2864720	Yeah everyone loved it but me.
2867520	2869920	I don't want to ride a roller coaster on acid again.
2871520	2873520	Yeah I think that's really fair.
2873520	2874800	It was scary.
2874800	2876480	Did everybody say their favorite stuff?
2877280	2881120	Oh we also have the world's biggest fork in Springfield.
2881120	2882320	Do we really?
2882320	2884800	Yeah it's over in Chesterfield village.
2884800	2889520	What was the restaurant?
2889520	2893600	I have to pee so I'm gonna ask I'm at my parents house I'm gonna ask them they probably
2893600	2893920	remember.
2893920	2894480	If you can pee.
2897200	2898960	Hey guys would be cool if I did this.
2898960	2901360	We're gonna we're gonna need to wrap this up because my parents said no.
2902000	2904080	We have to watch they have to watch me do it.
2904080	2910480	It's like my mom used to work in prison for a while so I'll be right back.
2910480	2915840	Luke has a huge urethra so it's easy to smuggle contraband in with.
2916880	2919120	It's more like splashing a bucket of water on the ground.
2920960	2921520	No one talk.
2922160	2924960	I'm also gonna go pee so I'll be right back.
2924960	2926800	Is this it's pee break time it sounds like.
2926800	2927520	Sounds like it.
2927520	2928880	I might as well take advantage.
2928880	2930000	I don't have to pee.
2930000	2931200	I don't have to pee either.
2931200	2932800	I'm just gonna stare down.
2933440	2934160	Hi Justin.
2934880	2935120	Hey.
2936000	2938000	Hey it's just you and me.
2938000	2939920	It's just us now us two guys.
2940480	2941760	Two fancy boys.
2941760	2943280	Your beard looks incredible.
2943840	2944240	Thank you.
2944240	2945120	It's doing pretty well.
2945120	2945840	I'm loving it.
2945840	2949760	I went I went the opposite direction where I was like I need to change something about
2949760	2951920	my life and I have control over my hair.
2956000	2957280	It looks very sharp.
2957280	2957760	Thank you.
2957760	2962480	My mom was whenever I first shaved I'd like did like the more clean shaven thing and she
2962480	2966880	was like she's like you look like you're 18 again and it's weirding me.
2967760	2972000	It's like I'll take that as a compliment being a 30 year old boy.
2973520	2978960	There's finally enough years on my face that I don't look like a total child when I shave
2978960	2983840	but I do still have like weird baby face so it's like man baby.
2987200	2991680	Have you been playing any dope games or anything or are you just watching a bunch of stuff or.
2991680	2995440	I've been playing the fuck out of Total War Three Kingdoms.
2995440	2997200	Oh I'm so jealous.
2997200	2998080	It's super fun.
2998720	3001440	My cousin actually bought it like gifted it for me.
3001440	3002800	Oh wow that's awesome.
3002800	3003680	Which was super nice.
3003680	3009040	Yeah I just woke up and like got on my computer and was like your dope ass cousin has sent
3009040	3009840	you a gift.
3009840	3011120	Oh that's awesome.
3011120	3015120	Because she bought her brother like the DLC for it the new DLC and she's like you guys
3015120	3018560	should play multiplayer together which we haven't I've just we've both racked up like
3020560	3024800	I can see his play count rising along with mine as we're just like at home alone.
3024800	3030800	I've heard what game Total War Three Kingdoms the newest Total War game it's a lot of fun
3030800	3034080	and the setting is really cool like ancient China.
3034080	3038880	Yeah I love that whole setting I used to play all the Dynasty Warriors games just because
3038880	3044160	I love that like the idea of that setting yeah and then realizing it was like actually
3044160	3048800	a thing makes it even more interesting it makes me want to play the Total War stuff because
3048800	3053760	I feel like they're a little more historical while still making the heroes more hero like
3053760	3056560	but it's more a little grounded in a lot of other aspects.
3056560	3062080	So you can play it like two ways which is kind of interesting romance or records is
3062080	3062560	what they call it.
3062560	3063600	Oh interesting.
3064400	3069440	So romance is based more on just like the novels the romance of the three kingdoms yeah
3069440	3075120	yeah and or just novel but and so it's it's also kind of inspired by the the war hammer
3075120	3076240	Total War games.
3076240	3081040	Yes yeah which are fantastical abilities and stuff and and and that your generals are just
3081040	3087040	like single units who have like superhero level powers yes yeah or you can play it more
3087040	3089680	old school Total War which is what I do.
3089680	3093840	Both those sound interesting to me for like different reasons but it's like yeah yeah
3093840	3098720	that's that that one's on my list for sure once it goes like just enough on sale it's
3098720	3102720	going to be one of those ones I just like instant buy and probably put like way too
3102720	3103920	many hours into.
3104720	3110960	So they asked another question Okay Nothing Four asked are you going to set a new Patreon
3110960	3122480	goal one million dollars you're the guy you tell us yeah I mean we will when we decide
3122480	3129200	what we want it to be we'll probably come up with two or three ideas and let the patreons
3129200	3135040	decide the patrons decide in a poll what the next goal will be so if your patron look out
3135040	3139120	for that that'll be coming up shortly you will figure it out.
3140000	3145360	They also asked for the players how much time do you each spend thinking about this campaign
3145360	3151680	outside of recording sessions it just Thomas don't answer first it'll make it sound bad
3156320	3162480	it just kind of depends on what you've told us to think about some specific things but
3162480	3169680	I legitimately think about it a whole lot and sometimes I pull out my notebook and refresh
3169680	3177920	myself on stuff okay sorry Thomas yeah yeah I mean you're right the answer the answer
3177920	3183680	is not much I think about the act of I think about us spending time together and stuff
3183680	3189600	like that but and like look forward to it yeah the act of physical love that we exactly
3189680	3193600	that we engage in well that makes sense I'll think about like cool stuff we did or like
3193600	3201360	things I might want to do or try to figure out but I am more with Thomas in this boat than uh
3201360	3207200	Joe a lot of it is like it I it'll be cool to do this next week also this might suck for like the
3207200	3212240	DM and like invested listeners to hear but I'm totally just here for the ride I'm have like
3212240	3216240	it's really fun to experience the mystery like washing over you yeah if we think about it too
3216240	3223760	much we might figure stuff out my animal yeah exactly how smart can how smart can Zach be
3224560	3231520	if you actually go back and listen to it um pretty pretty fucking good at this man
3233360	3241520	we know we know I would say even I think about it a lot while like making music and shit like
3241520	3246240	I think about like what moments could possibly come up or like what would have been cool for
3246240	3252080	another moment and also wolf wolf the dog in it every week obviously I'm like always kind of
3252080	3256880	caught up on what's going on and then being in the show even it was like it's so it's so many like
3256880	3261600	weird different angles that I feel like I've approached it from which is kind of kind of fun
3261600	3265600	if I haven't been thinking about it at some point within the week I will start thinking about it
3265600	3271200	again you know yeah yeah because I leave oh hit me I was gonna say this next question can
3271760	3277200	lead into whatever your answer is to both this and the next question oh oh bless you Joe that
3277200	3281680	was such a good transition I fucked it up immediately by thinking about it uh we got
3282480	3290720	Joe Tapa Joe Tapa Joe Tapa jot a paw anyway asks Zach what does your session slash campaign
3290720	3296160	preparation look like everyone how much time do you spend playing PTBP are you playing any other
3296160	3302480	TT RPG real quick I'll just hit the what does my prep look like when I was first writing the
3302480	3310480	campaign I would go to the public library so I didn't get distracted and I would sit down at a
3310480	3318240	google doc and I would write out characters who lived in contention and then I like not at the
3318240	3324240	very beginning like once I already had like the plots kind of slightly like the plot that happened
3324240	3330880	before the podcast started essentially so I wrote all that out almost like a short story first and
3330880	3340640	then I created NPCs out of that and then for week to week I do I actually like I write the campaign
3340640	3346880	week to week now because I have no idea how their actions are gonna affect what we do next so I try
3346880	3354720	not to plan too far in advance outside of like big moving pieces within the setting that's pretty
3354720	3359840	much same here nice do you have any do you guys did that make sense to you guys no yeah yeah
3362640	3368640	uh basically like if I if I have an idea of what their plan is or something I'll try to prep
3369200	3374240	places people and motivation and that's it and then I've talked about bangs before on the other
3374320	3381520	Q&A's yeah always having a few of those in back pocket is good so we've got are you guys playing
3381520	3388000	any other RPGs I guess that question would have been maybe different before I'm still playing
3388000	3398000	another delta green campaign I'm zooming it in tomorrow but he nobody else had ever played it
3398080	3401920	and the guy running it is not me so I'm helping him out a little bit
3402880	3406800	but it's fun it's called we're calling it the moldy worm campaign
3408080	3414960	gross nice but yeah it's fun but it's no it's no PTBP wow way to downgrade your
3416000	3420640	yeah that's rough shout out to I assume by everybody that listens to this
3421200	3424560	so Tyler
3427200	3433600	um I am actually haven't been playing any others but as I've vocalized a couple times here I've
3433600	3439760	been wanting to to dip in a little bit with running some stuff and I think I'm going to try
3440400	3446800	I didn't realize the core rule book of delta green and the one of the missions is free online it's
3446800	3451760	called need to know and you can download it and it gives you all the information that you need to
3451760	3458320	play your first game as well as a dope intro scenario exactly one we've ever done uh yes it's
3458320	3463760	the one with Clyde Bauman I believe Joe is the only one who has not played it so I'm thinking
3463760	3468320	of running some of my friends through that since uh we were kind of talking about doing it anyway
3468320	3473920	and a great social distancing thing is a role playing online so I think that's going to be a
3473920	3479280	big thing for me because I was like man I really would like to do this and it's fairly simple to
3479280	3483360	set up stuff online especially delta green you don't need a board or anything
3483360	3487200	to look at you just need your character sheets and your imaginations
3494080	3499840	why I just think I'm the luckiest role player in the world because PTBP is my weekly game
3499840	3507200	oh that's just so sweet of you Thomas why it is just so nice I appreciate the words that you say
3507200	3515360	to me every time yeah I think I definitely got spoiled by this being my first uh roleplay group
3515360	3523040	yeah like once we clicked and found each other uh especially reading horror stories on the internet
3523040	3529120	and just like normal stories on the internet I was just like oh fuck we once we finally booted

3568640	3580080	find you I have a very particular set of skills you guys like my Irish accent yeah that's really
3580080	3589600	good I have a daughter oh no I still remember it like an early comedy bang bang where Kevin
3589600	3594080	Pollock came on he was showing off his bit of like one word impersonations he's like can you
3594080	3599120	find one word that gets to the uh like absolute essence of the person you're trying to uh
3599120	3602160	impersonate sure and for Liam Neeson it was banana
3602160	3610480	oh that's really good he was like a little too proud of himself and he just kept saying it
3611520	3614720	yeah well that'll happen fun I've been thinking about it for like five years
3615680	3622720	worth it yeah hypothetically uh Joe Taba also I don't know how Joe Taba also asks
3623760	3629760	uh hypothetically if a gorilla uses sign language and asks that you eat it does the
3629760	3635440	gorilla's consent make the meat vegan or are you more worried that the gorilla might have
3635440	3642320	poisoned itself and is trying to kill you I don't trust anybody who's into vore uh gorilla or not
3647520	3655360	vore is the sexual fetish of being eaten I don't understand the issue I know you've asked me
3655360	3661680	several times so you know like you're like just a toe just nibble the toe I just want you to draw
3661680	3667280	it all right so we already talked about the guy who made tacos out of his foot yeah we did yeah
3667280	3675600	we did that well is dry uh we got another question here I didn't I I wouldn't eat it and it's not
3675600	3682080	vegan yeah I don't know if I would eat gorilla um it seems fucked up how tasty is it that's that's
3682080	3690240	a good question it'd be like eating a really strong man I know oh yeah it'd be sinewy the
3690240	3697120	closest we can get is to like eat how tasty is it how tasty is the rock I think like a big fat
3697120	3702000	gorilla would taste better yeah you gotta get some like you're gonna let's move on
3702960	3706800	you gotta get some you gotta fat that gorilla
3709040	3716080	feed you and feed you and feed you I want to eat a girl on a diet of like old meat from walmart
3718720	3722240	that joke wasn't bad it was jane goodall
3723040	3729200	oh my god yeah when they bust out the walmart truck
3731120	3740800	oh my god it's so fucking sad all right uh we got uh damn guardian uh dom guardian on reddit asks
3740800	3747440	how long do you usually play for like how long are sessions two to four hours depending on if we do
3748000	3758720	one or two yep yeah hour and a half to yeah nailed it moving on j sake or j sake i i don't know uh
3759520	3766800	so joe faved one of my tweets casting the pt bp tv series good stuff which led me to click on his
3766800	3773680	twitter profile which leads me to the following question joe why the fuck does obama follow you
3773680	3779760	on twitter oh and then we had a follow-up of j-hog inc said might as well ask why britney
3779760	3785520	spears follows him while we're at it is that real that is real the verified accounts i checked it
3785520	3789840	earlier today because i'd never seen that the verified accounts of both barack obama
3789840	3796800	and britney spears were two early followers of joe's twitter account yeah so me and barry go way
3796800	3803440	back uh i introduced him to michelle and brit brit has been a fan of mine forever back when we were
3803440	3807760	in the tall dark and handsome she was a fan of our band uh great answer moving on wait how did
3807760	3813520	that actually happen though the real answer is that obama follows i think anybody who follows
3813520	3818560	him i i haven't checked but that's i think he's probably got a million follows also joe's just
3818560	3824320	assumes that but really like barack has been for like a decade like well i won't fucking joe like
3824320	3830960	i just want him to notice me i wish joe would dm me slide into my dms he's got 115 million followers
3830960	3838960	but only 600 000 follow he's only following i'm in the top 600 000 baby yeah you're a great
3838960	3843840	american that's pretty good uh this next question is from barry obama
3846880	3849520	and it's just the complete uh lyrics to stan
3854880	3860720	i was when i was in a like elementary school maybe middle school i was i had a huge huge
3860720	3864320	huge crush on britney spears so maybe she sensed that through the net and was like
3865120	3870400	i'll throw that kid a bone did you ever like retweet something of hers or no i mean i probably
3870400	3875280	follow her that's probably where the accounts crossed paths but no i don't know why she's
3875280	3878720	following me there's a really cool dude named joe terry who's friends with both of them
3880880	3886640	it's his dad to be honest i don't want to meet the kind of person who's friends with both
3886640	3893440	britney spears and barack obama they've been looking at him they've seen some
3894080	3901200	dog shit i don't know man those both seem like very uh kind-hearted celebrities to follow yeah
3901200	3907120	britney's like leading the revolution now so i guess i should get on board uh we've got another
3907120	3912320	question from jay saki he says now that dennis detwiller has released an entire absolutely
3912320	3918480	amazing campaign around the king in yellow called impossible landscapes which starts this with the
3918480	3924000	scenario night floors will you get ross paton to run y'all through the whole thing pretty please
3924000	3929120	it's a wild fucking ride i think i should be the one that goes on there and none of you guys and
3929120	3936800	i'm just really combative the entire time with yeah i think that's a good i'd like that i won't
3936800	3942640	leave until it's finished but i make it as hard as the campaign yeah well frankly this town's not
3942640	3950400	big enough for uh for both of our podcasts so uh rppr watch your back
3953520	3959360	i would i would love to do that yeah that would be great i don't sounds fun yeah if ross has the
3959360	3965200	time that would be a huge commitment yes it would it would be really fun and really nice i absolutely
3965200	3972080	loved playing in uh night floors and to go back into that world would be a lot of fucking fun i
3972080	3977760	think that's such a cool weird scenario uh yeah i would love to love to do more of it that would be
3977760	3985520	super i would too super cool yeah i mean once we get the patreon up there's it's not out of the
3985520	3991680	realm of possibility if we hit a goal that was high enough to run a second campaign on the patreon
3991680	3999920	we also have to do get pins uh before we do that to give to him he was kind enough to give us all
3999920	4007280	enamel pins the rppr logos super cool and we got another question it's from xylopia on reddit said
4007280	4012720	did they ever finish the road construction work around zach's house parentheses yes we saw you on
4012720	4020880	the news zach mwahaha which is horrifying docs um i was on the news uh they are doing construction

4053840	4062800	and i'm like what the fuck luke ginsman valedictorian of ozark high school yeah if you google my
4062800	4072320	name and go to videos my speech is on there uh nice wow yeah we should maybe we can live stream

4125200	4131680	oh i think drew would be really good at people just watch it to hear his voice
4131680	4138320	uh so maybe he is more successful than what was his uh cousin's name emmit yeah yeah the emt
4140720	4146800	he also i was looking at his videos the other day and uh he favorited uh he actually has a
4146800	4152160	secret asmr youtube channel too oh that doesn't surprise me can you give us a little a little

4188560	4192000	question from that gave me like three sneezes if you know what i'm talking about
4192080	4202400	oh nearly there baby uh what's everyone's favorite horror movie and this is gonna
4202400	4209360	lead us into a few questions in a row about media uh so get ready uh what's everyone's favorite
4209360	4214880	horror movie or the very first very great one that comes to mind my fluctuates all the time
4214880	4220800	it follows is a great answer uh but i fell in love with the conjuring the very first conjuring
4220800	4224800	and i still rank it up there as one of my favorite horror movies of all time i think it's
4224800	4230160	really really well done the witch is up there for me too the witch is amazing which is awesome um i
4230160	4236960	gotta say my favorite all time is alien oh hell yeah it's such a perfect movie and then uh my
4236960	4246000	favorite recently is probably uh uncut gems i get a horror i consider it oh yeah man watch it again
4246000	4252080	like the first reaction you get from the movie is exactly like a great horror movie i saw it
4252080	4258080	three times and loved it i also before we went and saw it watched good time which is like good
4258080	4263120	time is awesome even crazier i still haven't seen that one it's really good it's on netflix it's on
4263120	4269600	my heart attack dude it's stressful he is our greatest working actor though i like honestly
4269600	4273680	believe that about this better than michael shannon yeah i think he's got more wrench oh
4273680	4279600	i can't wait for his batman did you see michael shannon play comedy in that christmas movie with
4279600	4286880	joseph he's really good and seth rogan and anthony mackie no it is it's really delicious uh justin
4286880	4291440	i saw that one together in theaters justin you got a favorite horror movie i don't i don't do a
4291440	4297600	lot of horror movies even though i'm always super interested in them uh i have trouble with the the
4297600	4302480	expectation of jump scares taking all the enjoyment out for me just like being like
4302480	4306880	there's probably going to be a jump scare because this camera angle is this way and it's edited this
4306880	4311440	way and then i just like yeah i have a lot of trouble actually getting to just sit there and
4311440	4318880	like get myself into it i think uh but best like horror like adjacent thing the hannibal tv show is
4318880	4324160	really fucked up and weird wonderful wonderful answer that's a really good answer that's so
4324160	4330320	good horror thing and it's really well done yeah it's like it's like is it horror it's like parts
4330320	4335840	of it are horror and parts are like this there's a lot of drama and it's like it's so also
4335840	4343680	soundtrack wise some of my favorite weird creepy soundtrack shit ever oh um actually uh i really
4343680	4349840	liked enemy a lot and a lot of that was soundtrack that was good it follows was like one of those
4349840	4355200	things though too where i i really liked it like thinking about it but watching it i just was like
4355200	4360000	always waiting for a jump scare and because of that i feel like it's harder for me to actually
4360480	4365600	just enjoy it for whatever reason if that makes any sense it's just like i'm waiting for that
4365600	4370880	noise to fuck me up instead of like focusing on the horror of what's actually happening
4370880	4377360	so dude i have so many horror movies in my mind i love that genre it's even the shitty ones are
4377360	4383840	great yeah luke showed me my favorite horror movie is my own mind man that's my favorite
4383840	4389040	horror picture luke one night we were hanging out and he was like have you seen drag me to hell
4389120	4395440	and i was like oh that one is really had a blast it was so fun uh it's like my favorite is the
4395440	4401600	shining like i i don't think i've seen anything that rivals that experience for me because i saw
4401600	4409040	a little too early and so it it's on like sixth or seventh grade and it it left a real mark
4410000	4417120	the scariest movie i've ever seen is sixth sense when i was 10 oh holy shit every time i went to
4417120	4422480	the bathroom at night same dude i was the other thing is i was like really into ghosts at the time
4422480	4427360	and i never thought about them being scary and like wounded and then i was convinced i was just
4427360	4432880	gonna see like a bloody fucking ghost like right i was like dude my mom is gonna be uh the bathroom
4432880	4437680	is at the end of this long ass dark hallway and i would just like sit at my door there was like
4437680	4444400	a few months when i would just like weigh if i really needed to go when i was in the second
4444480	4450480	grade i watched the ring and that terrified oh shit the ring is really fucking good yeah did
4450480	4457520	you just say second grade second grade it came out in 2002 i was in the second grade oh my god
4457520	4462400	you were probably in the third grade i was a super duper scaredy cat kid and horror movies
4462400	4469040	freaked me the fuck out to like crying hysterics and we were trying to watch uh the faculty
4469680	4475440	and john stewart in that movie gets all of his fingers cut off at one point and i ran screaming
4475440	4481280	out of the room and i was kind of like huddled in a corner and my evil sister comes running in
4481280	4485280	and going look my fingers are gone and she's holding down her fingers into her
4486480	4491040	at like she she had to have been you know six years old maybe and she was fucking with me the
4491040	4498480	older brother it was uh it was horrific that is exactly what i imagine your relationship with
4498480	4505440	your sister is still like exactly i call her in to kill the spiders for me and she tortures me
4505440	4512880	about it i got one more before we move on oh hit it okay the house of the devil or anything that
4512880	4519760	ty west directs all i've heard those are really good he did one of the in that movie vhs he did
4519760	4527680	one of those oh yeah yeah i would say recently mandy was like mandy's wonderful maybe not horror
4527680	4533680	like it's a thriller i guess technically oh it's pretty thrillers are definitely my like jam more
4533680	4538320	than horror same that's if we're doing thrillers i can run there's too many like thrillers are
4538320	4544000	definitely yeah the way it goes for me gotta say hereditary to hereditary i was just about to bring
4544000	4549600	up because that is like if we want to talk about like horrific movies yeah that's the scene with
4549600	4555600	the i'm gonna transition because i haven't seen that one yet just finally oh my god dude it's
4555600	4564480	gonna fuck you up it's so much let's move on to the next one marie x lupin marie x lupin asks
4564480	4570480	everyone what is your favorite piece of lovecraftian media books movies comics etc
4570480	4575920	or is playing tabletops your main slash only exposure to the genre thomas can you please
4575920	4580880	start since you said that you read lovecraft earlier uh yeah in my early 20s uh i read
4581440	4586000	uh a lot of the lovecraft stories i don't know if i really had a favorite because they're kind of at
4586000	4592000	this point just like interesting historical artifacts yeah oh there's one that is not
4592000	4600880	lovecraft but it's from like the 1890s or something uh the willows 1907 uh by algernon
4600880	4606880	blackwood um it's just a really name it's just a really creepy story about like these two guys
4606880	4613680	going down um the daniel river like on a canoe trip anyway it's it's just really it's it was
4613680	4619680	really influential for like the the tone of a lot of the things we all enjoy so that's my that's my
4619680	4624640	out of left field answer i don't remember if it really went anywhere i remember kind of being
4624640	4629760	dissatisfied in the ending maybe but i i did enjoy the ride and it's just like it's got atmosphere
4629760	4637520	out the fucking ass um and it's not uh racist like all of lovecraft stories so that helps my
4637520	4641760	answer my answer actually so i haven't read a whole lot of lovecraft i think i've read maybe
4641760	4646000	three or four of the short stories uh but one of my favorite pieces of media is called the the
4646000	4653200	ballad of black tom and it's one of his stories it's the uh horror at red hook from the viewpoint
4653200	4659360	of his black servant in that story whoa oh that's cool i've heard it's really really good it's a
4659520	4666080	novella you can read it in a night it's really really well done i read really slow uh i've
4667120	4676160	i've never read anything by hp lovecraft i haven't either uh i know that's kind of like uh
4677200	4682160	maybe fucked up but uh you should when we when we get off of here you should read like call it
4682160	4688800	gathulu because it's not that long and it's really cool for just the the world of like
4688800	4694000	unnatural horrors that it introduces and you'd understand you'd have more context to say
4694000	4702400	photography all the time which i do so probably my favorite lovecraftian media has got to be
4702960	4709280	the yellow wallpaper which i just recently brought up during one of the integral scenes
4709280	4716560	of the last episode of this last arc and what's cool uh for me like that story means a lot to me
4716560	4723680	personally uh because i once went insane and was trapped inside a room that my husband had locked
4723680	4730480	me in because i was anxious uh no uh so like i was obsessed with that book ever since i or the
4730480	4736560	since that short story ever since i read it for the first time when i was in sixth grade and then
4736560	4746320	i studied english in college the first time and i read it in two other classes actually and it
4746320	4754000	brought it back for me and then uh turns out that the girl i was dating who then uh was also named
4754000	4763600	taylor and is also my wife now uh she uh that is actually her favorite short story and so she
4763600	4769520	teaches it in her english classes i think she finds a way to push it in there and so it's
4769520	4775680	always on my mind anyway love that short story it's very creepy yeah i've never read lovecraft
4775680	4781680	but i've seen some like movies based on his stuff um when i was a kid i didn't realize it was
4781680	4789680	lovecraft but i saw um from beyond it's like a 80s like kind of b movie uh but it was scary when
4789680	4795040	i was a kid and i remember it being good and then i recently watched color out of space with nick
4795040	4801360	cage oh hell yeah that was really fun i want to that's on my list of quarantine movies i'm gonna
4801360	4808480	yeah it's i check out so i enjoyed it a lot um and then i recently played the uh call of cthulhu
4808480	4815120	game on the switch which was fun but took me like five hours to beat so not really worth the price
4816080	4822080	so one of my favorite lovecraft adjacent things which actually kind of got me more into it was
4822080	4827440	like the weird true detective season one shit where they talk about carcosa and the yellow
4827440	4832480	king and it's like kind of in the weird background and shit that actually was like one of the first
4832480	4836800	times i was like oh what is all like what's the yellow king what's this what's carco like i don't
4836800	4842400	i didn't really know anything before watching that and it added this weird like supernatural
4842480	4848560	tinge to uh what is more kind of grounded in reality and all the cultists and stuff like so
4848560	4853680	oh shit i'm gonna rewatch that yeah i've been thinking about it a lot lately for some reason
4853680	4857520	i don't know but that's mine i have actually we have a lot of time on our hands yeah
4859440	4863520	but yeah that's mine i actually like i'm kind of like some of the other people i haven't read any
4863520	4867600	lovecraft stuff i've actually been meaning to read the willows also that's on my list so when
4867600	4872160	thomas brought that up i was like oh someone i know actually has read this i added a bunch
4872160	4878320	of horror books to my to read list so i'm excited to dive into some it's a it's a good one when i
4878320	4882240	was i haven't done it in a few years but for a while i was really in the habit of reading like
4882240	4887280	our no sleep stories before bed and stuff interesting i've been doing that they're
4887280	4892400	perfect for it because they're like they're short they're spooky and engaging the only problem is
4892400	4898720	it's it just gets so hard to like find an actually good one for sure and i feel like the writer base
4898720	4905120	has gotten maybe younger yeah uh so there's just a lot of bad writing mistakes i literally last
4905120	4909680	night i hadn't been to no sleep in a long time but i just went to top of the year and started
4909680	4914080	reading that's always good yeah this is something i don't know if you guys have but like i said with
4914080	4919760	like horror movies specifically it's like prepping for that jump scare is like too much for me
4919760	4924800	sometimes for whatever reason i don't know if it's because i know video editing and camera work and
4924800	4928880	other stuff and kind of like the technical details of how they're prepping to do certain
4928880	4932400	things and horror stuff sometimes it's like oh they're probably going to do a jump scare and
4932400	4937440	then i get like more psyched out instead of like just kind of like soaking in the the ambiance or
4937440	4943280	whatever but reading horror does not have that effect on me at all and so i find myself when i
4943280	4949600	read scary stories or like a comic book or other stuff i really enjoy that and so i think i'm going
4949600	4955120	to start diving more because i love like the story of horror it's just the way so many horror
4955120	4960880	movies are shot is so jump scare heavy or you're even if it's not jump scare heavy i've been like
4960880	4966560	my mind is expecting it constantly so it like takes it it takes me out of it instead of like
4966560	4972800	just getting to like wallow in the the weirdness or whatever i get really annoyed when non-horror
4972800	4979360	movies have uh like set up shots over somebody's shoulder in a mirror or something yeah exactly
4979760	4984400	i was watching walking dead recently uh because my parents watch it and i was just kind of like
4984400	4987920	i was like i guess i'll hang out and watch it with you guys or whatever and it's like one of
4987920	4992000	those things where it's like oh there's going to be a jump scare here and almost every time
4992000	4996560	there is but it's still like it's because they always put like a stinger with audio and the other
4996560	5001600	stuff it always gets me because it'd be the same as like if someone just yelled at you randomly
5001600	5007120	out of nowhere in your everyday life you'd be like it's just like that sound and the way it's
5007120	5013040	usually cut and edited it always like it always works on me like it's really hard to get a good
5013040	5018000	one a good jump scare yeah i think they have their place for sure had my absolute favorite
5018000	5024560	jump scare of all time it's so fucking well done yeah everyone talked about that jump scare and i
5024560	5028560	didn't want to spoil it for myself but i haven't watched the series yet the whole series i loved
5028560	5033680	but that jump scare was it's an all-time for me it's so well done is it more of a slow burn kind
5033760	5038960	of horror thing or is it pretty jump scare heavy or uh both it's a slow burn because it's a series
5038960	5043040	yeah they have to stretch out the horror for yeah episodes or whatever it was but there are some
5043040	5048080	good jump scares in it but like i said they're well done like it's it's it's i think they're
5048080	5053520	one of my favorite ones ever yeah it's so well done it made my soul fly out of my body in such
5053520	5060640	a great way it took me four episodes before i was like oh yeah that's the other thing it's it does
5060640	5064800	take a few episodes i agree and but then it became one of my favorite it's like a really
5064800	5070880	good it's like a really good family drama that's also a horror thing like it's not just scary it's
5070880	5078000	like actually like a well-acted there's also one episode that's all one take and it's really well
5078000	5084480	done yeah they did a good job on that yeah that's on my list how long is that shot well so i mean
5084480	5088960	it's there's trickery involved but it's the episode i mean they don't cut for the whole
5088960	5095600	oh that's right that's right but there is one sequence that is like 12 minutes long wow where
5095600	5100240	they actually like don't have yeah like oh yeah you're right you're right uh i read that on the
5100240	5105600	mdb trivia that like that one of their longest not actually it's super long cuts yeah it's
5105600	5110080	super duper long they they did a whole thing where because that the whole show takes place
5110080	5116560	between two time periods and they they did a camera transition between sets to do the time
5116560	5121600	change there's a whole behind the scenes of that episode that's so so freaking cool well and that
5121600	5127920	leads us into to another question about whether or not clark bishop's character uh is based on
5127920	5135120	jonas convolt from dark oh yeah i i would never say sure but i've never seen it i know i i didn't
5135120	5140320	think uh either of you had um it's actually it's pretty good it would be a good quarantine watch
5140320	5144720	i've heard nothing but good things about that show but the first time that i put it on i was
5144720	5153120	too high to read it is it is all subtitles um i heard it described as grown-up stranger things
5153120	5157120	that's a pretty good way to put it actually what about grown-ups too and stranger things
5157120	5164320	that would be great it is it is like so there's this time travel thing going on in this town and
5164320	5170000	no spoilers they i'm i won't spoil it but they set it up so it's a certain amount of years between
5170000	5176240	like time-traveling windows and they just like very like carefully do it so it avoids all of
5176240	5182880	the unpleasantness that happened in germany during some certain years which is a good call
5182880	5190960	but it's a little like interesting no nazis in this store no nazis only before and after
5191840	5197360	millennium hand is who asked that question by the way millennium hand german is like a really uh
5197440	5201440	funny language to to read the subtitles of and then like hear it
5201440	5205360	because the subtitles will be like are you all right and they're like das ist in ordinung
5212240	5216000	uh yeah no i will watch that i'm excited to watch it and then i'll steal all the
5216000	5220800	ideas to finish up clark's ark all right it's good i think taylor would really like it too
5221440	5228400	probably uh she's also very into this exact kind of tv we actually watched uh haunted
5228400	5235200	hill house haunting the heil house uh twice didn't mean to say heil so uh
5235200	5241760	we got a question from the quiet shouter oh my god thomas has pulled down his shirt
5242400	5250000	so deeply to reveal all of his chest hair and both of his nipples which he is rubbing vigorously
5250960	5256000	well the podcast got us these nice webcams and i've got to make a little extra money somehow so
5257840	5261200	i honestly have been thinking about like would i get kicked off uh
5261200	5265280	like a porn campsite if i just went on like with my two kittens
5266480	5272800	oh hey guys look at me not if your dick's out there you go probably even just like one ball
5272800	5278720	would be fine one ball in it that's like what i'm into just some real lance armstrong hitler shit
5280960	5286080	don't take it out of context but they both have one testicle all right so uh all right
5287360	5293840	god well you guys didn't get that from just like the thing i said well i just i don't know you
5293840	5300560	said heil earlier and i got all confused yeah it was like i'm really sorry zach becoming a nazi
5301760	5308640	i don't think so uh so quarantine does strange things to us all not that thankfully we've got
5308720	5316640	a question now is all right uh the fun jojo rabbit nazis dude that movie was incredible
5317680	5323120	we got a question from the quiet shouter who asks what is each character's favorite musical
5323120	5330000	drew's is the producers mine is nice wicked i don't know about keith but john lee pettymore's
5330000	5335760	is uh guys and dolls because it was the one he was in in high school yep clark's is wizard of
5335760	5339920	us he likes the idea of getting the courage and the brains and the heart
5345520	5350320	wolf the dogs would be phantom of the opera because he likes how that guy lurks around
5350320	5357840	in the theater all the time oh my god that's perfect a personal personal yeah he's like he's
5357840	5365280	like this show needs a name there luke what about keith vigna do you think he's ever seen a musical
5365280	5370080	probably not i mean he's seen the wizard of oz so he would probably just hop on and say that
5371680	5378480	i don't know how would keith vigna pronounce lay miserab he would he wouldn't try
5380960	5386720	less miserables exactly we've got another question from quiet shatter asks what book
5386720	5393040	recommendations do y'all have for the fine folks in the contention book club uh right now i'm
5393040	5399120	reading the plague by kamu because it seemed thematically appropriate and it's good i think
5399120	5405680	i'm an anarcho-syndicalist now so not really so that's nice um i've been reading a book called
5405680	5413920	why buddhism is true by a behavioral psychology anthropologist that's really cool as i am on my
5413920	5420000	mindfulness bullshit basically talking about how like the teachings of buddhism are like actually
5420000	5425920	still ringing true in modern psychology and how they apply to humans as we have evolved from
5425920	5430800	living in villages and stuff but we still like freak out over the same things that we've always
5430800	5437840	freaked out over because our brains aren't that much evolved from those past times it is a very
5437840	5442400	cool book and he's very funny that's he's very funny otherwise it would not be fun to read
5443200	5448480	i would recommend house of leaves i always loved that and any fan of this podcast would probably
5448480	5454720	find something to like in it uh and then also the next question is from uh the modest light
5454720	5461200	who brings up uh john dies at the end which is uh i love that book too and a fan of this podcast
5461200	5466640	would also find a lot to enjoy in there if you've found that um you don't read as much as you once
5466640	5471920	did or would like to because of the internet or just the world or whatever i just read uh
5471920	5476960	kitchen confidential by anthony bordain and it's you know it's a book i'd always heard about
5476960	5481920	uh but it was really entertaining it's a really quick read and it like really helped put that
5481920	5486240	reading habit back into my life and it became a lot easier after like having a book that i
5486240	5490240	could just that was like a page turner that i could just scorch through to like make time to
5490240	5498000	read each day now that's awesome so so did living in quarantine uh real quick to give a suggestion
5498000	5504240	for a book uh for the contention book club would just be uh Dianetics the modern science of
5507200	5521920	it oh no and all your people here you're tremendous except the people in the left
5521920	5529440	when you're smoking on a big ass i think i'll probably read john dies at the end because
5529440	5536000	i've seen the movie like five times over the past many years and like the movie it's
5536560	5542160	did you like it are you so you've seen it many times because you like it yeah so i it it's the
5542160	5548480	weirdest thing that that movie starts out so perfectly stuck to the book like the first act
5548480	5553760	is is verbatim from the book and then it goes really wild at the end i wonder if they ran out
5553760	5558880	of budget or something it it really screws with the story and it leaves out a huge chunk that's
5558880	5565120	like a whole like arc in the book it's it's really wild how crazy that movie went i'm really glad
5565200	5572480	that i didn't read it first then yeah because like it was fun i have not seen the movie or read the
5572480	5579440	book but i should so far in quarantine i went back and read uh cat's cradle again i anything
5579440	5586720	Vonnegut is always good yes read breakfast of champions and then i read uh the time machine by
5586720	5593920	hg wells it's really short and fun and then i've been reading a lot of Cormac McCarthy books so i
5593920	5600560	read uh shit i forgot the name of one of them uh child of god was interesting it's pretty short too
5600560	5607440	uh and i'm reading blood meridian right now and it's very violent and it's still cool i really
5607440	5613040	like uh douglas adams i think that's probably i haven't read john dies at the end but i'm guessing
5613040	5618560	that my favorite book by him uh which is dirk gently's holistic detective agency
5619120	5626160	probably has a super super fun yeah probably has a similar vibe i don't know also that was a
5626160	5632000	crazy tv series uh i don't know if you guys saw my list it's on hulu right now what is it
5632560	5639040	two seasons of very fun television with elijah wood if i'm not mistaken it is elijah wood indeed
5639040	5647840	uh really fucking silly and very very fun anon a no-no asks okay i've got a real scandalous one
5647840	5655920	kiss marry kill past present future i love kiss give a little yeah kisses give a little smooch
5655920	5664080	brother yeah you gotta you gotta kill your past gotta kill your past kill the past kiss the
5664080	5669120	present marry the future boom yeah that's mine for sure no i think you gotta kiss the future
5669120	5673920	you gotta marry the present you gotta marry the present you gotta be grounded in that present
5673920	5678880	baby but but without without completely killing the possibility of the future you want to give
5678880	5685040	it a smooch you have to look forward to it with a gentle smooch but yeah sometimes a kiss can lead
5685040	5694880	to the future but uh right now my present is uh is coronavirus lockdown so i would kill it
5694880	5699120	i would kill it to do anything to the future
5701840	5707600	whatever you want future i'll do whatever you need baby whatever yeah to ride this wave uh
5707600	5713680	i've got some great news uh i mentioned last week's uh on last week's episode that my dad
5713680	5719920	uh went in and got tested for covid and his test came back negative
5720880	5723760	yeah
5723760	5730880	two days later his fever broke and he's feeling no symptoms and my mom has not gotten sick or gotten
5730880	5737840	any symptoms but they're both still doing a full 14-day quarantine to make sure and i am proud of
5737840	5743520	them both and super happy that they don't hopefully have it because it could be a false negative but
5743520	5748560	hopefully not yeah so it's wild how much the symptoms mirrored it and then to yeah be negative
5749200	5755280	that's awesome dude it's also wild some of the like false the like the tests are kind of bad
5755280	5759840	especially depending on where they came from like some of them fail up to like 30% of the time
5759840	5761920	so yeah but your mom's fine probably
5765680	5770480	zach oh he was frozen i see i thought he was oh yeah i did too
5773120	5775120	did someone say something mean about my dad
5775120	5783520	nobody said anything about but the truth about your about your shitty fucking dad
5785120	5788160	denny denny is amazing maybe one of the best people
5790080	5797600	to have ever existed he's a good one uh hey question joe yo do do we need to wrap this
5797600	5803920	thing up oh no i can keep going okay i assume everyone else is on a uh similar sleep schedule
5804000	5812320	to me so let's keep pushing yes yeah yeah okay sorry not asking a question no sorry
5812320	5819040	when my statements are supposed to be questions um just so forceful we got a question from
5819040	5826480	at snuggles mcsquigg nice does each cast member have a favorite character they'd
5826480	5830960	created for a past campaign they wish they could bring into a new one oh yeah
5830960	5838560	yeah yeah for sure doctor dr denny denison i really hope makes an appearance at some point
5838560	5845120	dr denny denison was great that was a character he was a cult surgeon yeah he was a doctor surgeon
5845120	5852320	for a cult uh i think i got kicked out of it you did get kicked out of it uh i don't remember how
5852320	5858720	he was just nasty and gross he was always trying to collect bodies yeah he developed a poop fetish
5859440	5866160	at one point he sounds like a joy that was fun that one so yeah luke literally when i gave him
5866160	5872560	that fetish uh just ran with it he stood up and he said okay i'm gonna play this out i'll be right
5872560	5878320	back and he walked out of the room and we all sat there and then he walked back in and he set up a
5878320	5885200	chair as the toilet which is like he got this fetish from like finding a clue inside a toilet
5885200	5893040	that was filled with shit he found it in a turd right yeah and then like as he found it like a
5893040	5901440	bunch of the brood worm yeah like yeah like came out of the the the fecal matter as well and so
5902720	5908640	he acted out like charade style him with this chair as the toilet and then him acting out the
5908640	5914480	entire scene of pulling out and all the facial expressions to come with it and that's when i knew
5915200	5923600	that i was in a very good fun role-playing group yeah so that's that's mine miss him forever i
5923600	5929280	have three actually from like three really different i'm fucking sorry joe but if you
5929280	5934800	can show the fuck yes joe some of us take role-playing seriously and i know you don't
5937200	5943600	i've looked at joe's notes and it's just he just writes penis over and over again with diagrams
5944400	5949200	that's true you're really good at drawing all my plots just spent all his time role-playing
5949200	5955600	just trying to imagine what each character's penis looks like that's my style baby that's
5955600	5963120	the most excited thing like he's not listening to anything zach says except except for how it
5963120	5969280	might inform what like the dude's fucking junk looks like it's like describe this squamous tube
5969360	5975840	monster how confident is how confident is this guy what's his walk look like
5977680	5981920	i can tell you very confidently confidence has nothing to do with size
5986560	5995120	um no uh we talked about the scion campaign before i uh really loved my guy who uh killed
5995120	6002480	saddam hussein and he was a curt he was a curtish rebel he was really fun to play as because he had
6002480	6007520	a bunch of like weird skills and was like kind of a weird character to be with all those other
6007520	6014560	i mean in scion everyone's kind of but he had a lot of guns and knives and swords yeah which
6014560	6021920	was fun in a weird like magical god thing to be like yeah i have a fucking gun though and then uh
6022560	6028320	from the patreon episode i really loved my guy who had the little tiny teleporting cat
6028320	6034560	in his pocket yeah agent wolf i actually really liked him and uh more i just liked that he had
6034560	6040480	a little teleporting cat that lived in his like dress shirt pocket and then in one of my dnd
6040480	6046560	campaigns where i first got introduced to role-playing i had a weird minotaur blacksmith
6046560	6052880	character who had a big hammer and one of my other friends was a dragon person or whatever
6052880	6058240	i don't there's they're called dragon born is it okay he was a dragonborn or wait is that
6059360	6066880	no it might be i think it's dragonborn it's both right yeah yeah um but he uh our dm let us do a
6066880	6072400	combo attack where he would heat up my hammer as though i was gonna do some sick ass blacksmith
6072400	6078240	shit with it and then like bash people away and he also had a bunch of grappling moves so he's
6078240	6083440	just like hitting people with this huge hammer that's almost like melted while like suplexing
6084160	6090400	other dnt characters so that's really fun he was very fun character that you had on the same
6090400	6096720	patreon episode as agent wolf yeah it's one of my favorite characters that we've had on the show
6096720	6104000	oh thank you i liked him too he was uh he was uh he was psycho he was unfeeling
6105760	6109840	clark is definitely my favorite character i've ever played but i also really liked
6109840	6113360	the first time i ever played with you guys i had a character named stacy bloom
6114240	6120480	and he was a wide-eyed new kid on in law enforcement let alone delta green so i it was i
6120480	6126400	was able to play my own real reactions to feeling you guys out about how to play this
6126400	6131920	new game i've never played before i could do it through the guys of this wide-eyed new character
6131920	6139840	and to give uh listeners an idea of what stacy bloom walked into uh he joined right after the
6139840	6146000	other players had just run through last things last into the shotgun scenario metamorphosis
6146800	6151600	so uh last things last is the one we were talking about earlier and then metamorphosis
6151600	6158480	is a shotgun scenario for delta green and those two pair very very well and then joe came in and
6158480	6165520	they were all explaining what happened uh in the last session and his eyes were fucking massive
6167440	6172480	it was quite the world to be thrown into you yeah thomas thomas i would i would agree with
6172480	6176400	joe that john lee pettymore is probably the favorite my favorite character i've ever played
6176400	6186000	um but uh that same scion game justin was talking about uh i played a david bowie inspired superhero
6186000	6194080	named aladdin sane uh who was like a legitimate pop star and uh in the world so i got to like make
6194080	6200320	up dumb little songs and stuff can you give us a taste it was so fun yeah the one we all the the
6200320	6206960	one people seem to remember the best one it was yeah we were playing this game at christmas time
6206960	6211600	so i was talking about like the profits from my from my numerous christmas albums and i brought
6211600	6217360	up the song christmas time in london town they're like well how does that go and it goes it's
6217360	6226800	christmas time in london town the skies are gray and the streets are brown the streets are brown
6226880	6229360	the streets are brown we all just kind of looked at it
6233680	6239280	that was a really fun campaign and then my very first dnd character was uh an era kokra which is
6239280	6248400	a bird person oh yeah i named myself harvey birdman and uh my two uh would be my pathfinder
6248400	6253600	character and the only game of pathfinder i played uh for like two or three sessions before i bailed
6253600	6257040	because we started making this podcast and i didn't have time for literally anything else
6257040	6266800	in my life ever again was his name was alexander iman and he was a bard halfling and his name was
6266800	6277680	alexander iman and if you shortened it his name was alex seaman yeah uh yep i think that got a
6277680	6288320	yeah from luke like yeah uh-oh it took andy way longer to realize that i mean as soon as i heard
6288320	6294160	it i was like yeah that's dope yeah the other players and the gm didn't realize until the
6294160	6300880	third or fourth session uh after which i andy andy's a sweet boy i stole all their gold and
6300880	6309280	i left to go try to save my sister and ended up giving a virus like a disease to an entire town
6309280	6316880	down river so uh yeah the other one was uh i really liked the delta green shotgun scenario
6316880	6326160	burner uh that ross paton wrote uh i played a brolo named brody and uh there was a fun
6326160	6334240	scene in that one where i got to um uh you know make a bunch of molotov cocktails and bust open
6334240	6343040	the doors of a saloon while blasting eye of the tiger and i had taken like the grime from the
6343040	6349680	floor of the bar and like rubbed it underneath my eyes to to become a warrior and then i died
6349680	6355120	that uh that is still one of the most fun uh sessions i've ever played in and your actions
6355120	6361360	in it like opened up the insane possibilities of role-playing for me i'd never played delta green
6361360	6366800	and you were like so confident as like you're we we played all these people who came together when
6366800	6371440	like shit hits the fan at this strip mall and i think you were just like the teenager who worked
6371440	6376800	at a cell phone store right yeah and you were just like really confidently like playing with
6376800	6381360	the world and what you were allowed to do and i was like oh that's dope thank you i hated a
6381360	6387280	bathroom and posted on reddit a bunch at the beginning yeah you like it was like what's zach
6387280	6390960	doing and he's like yeah i'm just on my phone in the bathroom but then you were also like you had
6390960	6395040	snuck into the bar and you made the molotovs without us like really knowing i was just passing
6395040	6399840	sam notes and he was having me do like secret checks and then like he basically passed me a
6399840	6403920	note that was like all right narrate your cool scene of you like coming out of the bar with all
6403920	6412240	your molotovs and um yeah molotovs didn't help uh the shotgun that i didn't have ammo for didn't
6412240	6421360	help it was the fact that we all got real shit face didn't help yeah and there were like seven
6421360	6428160	players at the table and two people were sharing one player yeah that was wild that was wild god
6428160	6436880	bless sam all right uh very very much so yeah uh anyone else have any players i think that's it
6438320	6443920	all right cool uh so they actually had another question snuggles mcsquig asked are there any
6443920	6449920	other systems anyone is interested in trying something like never going home which is a world
6449920	6456160	war one kathulu rpg with beautiful art well i've never heard of it until now but yeah that sounds
6456160	6461360	dope as i've said before love to get more into dungeon world and really learn that system a
6461360	6466560	little bit better i have the book the book is also very cool and fun to read i've been really wanting
6466560	6472880	to get into uh like super stripped down rpg stuff uh sam actually ran us that weird like homebrew
6472880	6477520	thing where it was like the most stripped down ever i'd like to go like a couple steps above
6477520	6484480	that where it's like yeah there's a thing called uh risus or r-i-s-u-s it's free on the internet
6484880	6490720	uh people said it's a really good introductory way to do role-playing stuff uh just in case
6490720	6497200	anyone else was looking for that like i was a couple days ago is this the anything rpg
6497200	6504080	oh risus is latin for laughter it's uh i think it's just like a very like bare bones like you
6504080	6508960	can kind of apply it to whatever stuff you want it to be which sounds really interesting to me
6508960	6513680	i kind of like that like zach said i kind of what can i do that like i want to do like cooperative
6513680	6519920	storytelling more than like gameplay functionality it's like we can play a video game together if we
6519920	6526800	really want to get down into that stuff but i'd rather have like the just a a loose set of rules
6526800	6531520	to guide a story it's kind of what i like there's a lot of like single page rpgs that i'd love to
6531520	6538960	play i'll do whatever zach runs same yeah i've always really wanted to play like a long-term
6538960	6544320	sci-fi campaign uh same like the star wars one or something no no i really wouldn't want it to be
6544320	6550400	like in a star wars world just i got you bigs but like yeah having fun in a space opera setting
6550400	6556160	would be dope this is one that i would be interested in if zach would run it no stop
6556160	6564880	sharing screenshots and it ruined ugo rpg does what exists anybody has a ugo rpg
6565840	6573040	boy howdy i've been wanting to play in a deadlands it's the weird west one it sounds like it'd be
6573040	6580000	super cool super cool dope did you guys uh did you guys listen to dad lands i did adventure time
6580000	6587040	live episode oh yeah i did yeah it's super funny wait oh gotcha yes that was really adventure zone
6587040	6593600	none of them yeah so i got super confused oh in adventure time rpg would be fun as fuck i bet
6593680	6598400	there is one oh i'm a big star trek nerd i'd love to play the star trek role-playing game
6598400	6604240	apparently it's super cool because you have like your character but also you have like ship traits
6604240	6609200	that when you're on the ship like you have maneuver it and stuff it looks super cool that's
6609200	6612800	exactly the kind of thing i want to play where we're like the crew of a spaceship going yeah
6612800	6621120	different like well instead of that uh what we are probably gonna play soon is someone made a
6621200	6624400	play set for fiasco based on tiger king
6631600	6639760	i just sent a message uh there is an adventure time uh tabletop rpg and this is the entire set
6639760	6647680	of rules and everything so that'd be fun very fun uh we've got another question here from dazed
6647760	6653840	underscore wanderer asks one what the fuck zach spelled my name wrong so
6655440	6660960	what the fuck dazed underscore wanderer back at you number two uh was everything
6660960	6664400	in the storage lockers k-cells hmm
6664720	6667680	hmm
6670720	6678720	interesting uh so next week or basically here's what i'm thinking is uh i would like to do another
6678720	6686240	q a that is a plot q a where we can talk about like things that the characters have learned
6686240	6691200	and connecting some of those dots together let's give the people what they want more q a's
6695200	6703040	so i think now is a really good time to uh get the plot like ironed out and have you guys ready
6703040	6712480	to um head into the next arc of this story uh so we will answer that question on that episode
6712480	6718800	number three how's ropo they still on that grind to lose weight they are i feed them less than
6718880	6726400	you're supposed to you're the correct amount for a diet and then they they chase each other around
6726400	6731440	uh so i'm hoping that's what does it any fitness tips from you guys yeah get ropo hitting the
6731440	6738160	weights get ropo fucking jack you should start chasing both of them for their food chasing them
6738160	6743120	yeah you should you should chase them to really get them motivated and you should have taylor
6743120	6749440	film it and send it to me privately my my personal what do you want me to wear my personal
6749440	6754480	fitness tip for the uh for the coronavirus apocalypse to everyone out there is to uh get
6754480	6758400	your yoga mats out of the closet and put them in the living room but then never fucking do shit
6758400	6766320	with them mine are in the living room but i've been working out almost every day i've been
6766320	6770560	working out a couple times a day because i'm drinking a lot of beer a couple times a day
6771520	6778480	yeah nice i've been going on runs i run a small in cave and back yeah nice i've lost uh 15 pounds
6778480	6785840	in the last uh 24 days thank you that's awesome how much of that was from the haircut
6789520	6798720	12 our beloved chuckling boy asks if the next campaign you played could not be in the kathulu
6798880	6806640	family of game systems rude dg csc pulp trail etc what would it be and why is it red markets
6806640	6813280	i don't know what red markets is but let's do that one yeah red markets is apparently
6813280	6820080	chuckling boy it's good enough for me i've heard only great things and i know ross paton
6820080	6826560	is really into it which would make sense because it's written by caleb stokes who lives around here
6826560	6834240	and is on rpr rppr a fair amount and wrote a really he also wrote a really dope campaign
6834240	6841040	called god's teeth that he ran on rppr that is being published currently are being worked on
6841040	6847680	to be published by delta green currently and yeah red markets is basically a survival game
6847680	6854400	where you are in a zombied world but then your supplies run low and you have to go out on
6854400	6861040	missions and like the more intense the mission is the better like rewards are available on that you
6861040	6867680	know and basically you're trying to survive and make a world for yourself so the description is
6867680	6875120	really interesting online uh red markets a game of economic horror yes uh and red markets characters
6875120	6879280	risk their lives trading between the massive quarantine zones containing a zombie outbreak
6879280	6885360	in the remains of civilization that sounds markets uses the traditional uh zombie genre
6885360	6890880	to tell its story about surviving on the wrong end of the economy weird sounds that sounds really
6890880	6897120	interesting that sounds close yeah that sounds dope thanks for the tip chuckling boy i hit up
6897120	6903840	caleb on twitter and asked if he would run god's teeth for us when it and he said when it's
6903840	6912000	published he will so that's fucking sick uh maybe he'll ride run some red markets for us before then
6912000	6917360	seeing as how he's the dude who wrote it i've seen him stream shit i bet he can do it remotely
6918400	6923440	that'd be cool uh he also asked uh chuckling boy asked what is a question that you were surprised
6923440	6928880	no one has asked i can answer this literally anything about the campaign i don't know why
6928880	6933520	people don't ask questions about the story stuff it always surprises me it feels like
6933520	6938080	the people on the subreddit have a much stronger grasp of the campaign than us so
6940800	6946560	yeah they they don't need any questions yeah they know what's going on i don't understand why you
6946560	6954560	guys don't can we do a q a where we get the cues you guys ask the questions and then the chat
6954560	6963600	answers them yeah there you go so sad uh should the should the air uh light be on on my focus
6963600	6970720	right yeah uh i think joe got you to turn it on before we started he totally pranked you because
6970720	6979680	now you sound like you've been sucking in helium the entire time oh no great break though uh we
6979680	6987680	got another question here from gwen egr and they ask how do you like to transition between
6987680	6993920	campaigns do you prefer to build off an old thread or create something brand new create something
6993920	7000240	brand new every time i think that especially in delta green most of the games i think all the
7000240	7007440	campaigns that we've played in end with at least some sort of impact that would leave the globe
7007520	7013520	reeling and therefore if we were to start another campaign in that same world the impact of the
7013520	7020480	previous campaign would be evident and therefore i prefer to have a clean slate yeah in the uh
7020480	7025920	in the two previous like mega campaigns we've done with you uh we did not
7028480	7034960	save things you put it off you put it off for a long time we tried
7035920	7040480	we did our best that's all anyone could have expected from us i think we mostly go insane
7040480	7047840	or die and and then the world ends yeah whose character like got killed and then came back
7047840	7055040	alive and killed over and over again that was thomas's professor character was trapped in a room
7055040	7059520	it wasn't that you died though right it was that you had to watch your wife die over and over again
7059920	7067920	wasn't that the thing yeah he had to watch a film of him performing a spell on his wife who had
7067920	7074640	cancer trying to cure her and fucking up the spell and killing her and he had to
7074640	7078960	watch that on repeat infinitely super fun do you remember her name
7078960	7092160	times elizabeth uh yeah i believe uh the great old lord cthulhu came on up out of the ocean
7092160	7096800	at the end of that campaign and stared joe's character right in the eyes we blinked at each
7096800	7100000	other it's cute it's a meet cute
7104000	7108880	oh you come to this beach too cthulhu dropped something on the beach and you guys bonk heads
7109200	7116640	for talking you talk funny bud
7119360	7120560	but i think you're so cute
7122880	7128640	uh we got another question this is uh oh man ain't on a no-no you've really truly
7128640	7134160	outdone yourself here if you were stranded on a dessert island what kind of sentient
7134240	7142240	confectionary treats would you hunt for survival gummy bears oh that'd be a truly horrifying one
7144160	7147680	they're full they're full-sized like they're bear-sized
7147680	7154800	yep uh yeah joe took the good animal and i would hunt whatever was brownies
7155600	7157600	so
7161600	7167920	and you know if they if they happen to like get like warm by being chased then maybe
7167920	7173440	chase them around like directly toward the vanilla ice cream fountain or something like
7174320	7180480	god stop zach and uh and then that's all that's all i need for a perfect dessert uh you know if
7180480	7187600	you want to drop a double shot of espresso on top of that be it since you're not um stop it
7187600	7197360	i forgot to have one uh whatever weird critter i want like a turtle made out of chocolate chip
7197360	7204400	cookies but his body is like a hershey's chocolate turtle body but his shell is a big chocolate chip
7204400	7210720	cookie yeah i get you cut him i can like split him right down the half in front of his turtle
7210720	7221920	family crack him open that yeah that's a good answer i want to hunt down uh a moose that is
7221920	7229920	darker than dark and squeamish like oil and it writhes about in the air and i just like moose
7229920	7236160	i like moose and pudding a lot i could do something like that uh would be good for me on
7236160	7240720	an island you're a little pudding boy oh dude when the sun's out i've got to have my pudding
7244080	7250960	i haven't had a a dessert pizza in like a decade yeah the godfather's m&m pizza is like the
7250960	7257760	godfather's m&m pizza was so good i want one right now herman cain baby oh i forgot herman
7258000	7267120	started oh yeah was he the cigarette smoking ad um he was he was the stare and smile uh the stare
7267120	7271520	and smile he might have also been the cigarette ad i don't remember oh what a character i want
7271520	7281360	andy's that's andy's uh custard that's my answer just but what animal would it be would you have
7281760	7286560	brutally kill while you i would be i would be stranded there with andy and
7289760	7291760	i would force him to make me custard
7295040	7299280	actually you guys have seen you guys have been to andy's you have to watch the the custard
7299280	7306080	come the chocolate comes out it looks like and um and that's the joke yeah i get a brownie
7306080	7312640	that's a fresh idea i get a stolen brownie pecan concrete every time oh no i got an idea you have
7312640	7321120	to suck the custard out of zach's weird chocolate moose moose out of his bunghole i was thinking
7321120	7328320	like oh teats no it's out of its butt because we said it looked like poop wow now we agreed to it
7328800	7339840	all right uh i don't like this island so holy shit a pigeon well yeah fantastic name asks which
7339840	7346960	player character has the nicest butt i think it's john lee pettymore i think i think canonically it
7346960	7352240	is i think that in one of the early episodes you said that he has a magnificent ass he's got a
7352240	7358080	tight ass he wears he wears two tight jeans yeah yeah in a good way to people like it
7358560	7364320	holy shit a pigeon also asks who would you pick to play your characters and npc's if pt bp
7364320	7371520	was a live action movie or show we are going to take our time with that question on the next
7371520	7378320	episode how about that uh it was all a snow globe asks how much of the story right yeah that's fun
7378320	7384080	uh how much the story writing process is influenced by slash influences the song you've
7384080	7388880	chosen for the intros do you typically find that music influences you're writing a lot
7388880	7395920	yes it absolutely does i remember specifically writing the plot for the silver spheres when
7395920	7400240	i realized that john lee pettymore was the only one who had picked it up and then he put it in
7400240	7406960	his pocket and i said okay well those balls have to do something weird and then i was like okay
7406960	7413040	well why is john lee pettymore allowed to touch it if no one else is and no backbone was a part
7413040	7417360	of that like when i was coming up with like the idea for that i was like oh shit this is this is
7417360	7425280	perfect uh so literally that song made thomas's character's entire arc essentially nice super
7425280	7434240	cool the theme song's about me guys uh and then when i was picking out the other songs
7434960	7441680	yeah i find the lyrics like extremely important especially like uh moon dance i knew i knew what
7441680	7449440	i was looking for plot wise uh for that arc before i got the song picked out but uh when
7449440	7454640	that song happened when i came across it i was like oh yes of course this is absolutely perfect
7454640	7460480	and then the next one this most recent one where we had dream girl uh that actually influenced the
7460480	7468080	plot as well once i decided on that one uh that actually probably helped change joe's entire plot
7468080	7476240	uh for that the line uh i swear i knew you before this yep yeah and then she says uh corner room
7476240	7484560	and it was right so the room has no corners which is an allusion to a circle the hounds of tenderloose
7485280	7493520	which is some nerd shit and a circle um okay moving on uh so a lot a lot and always and it
7493520	7500720	always matters so uh ain't on a no-no once again how much filth could have wolf ah fuck i fucked
7500720	7505200	it up how much felt could a wolf wolf down if a wolf could wolf down filth well done
7506480	7510320	uh justin why are you asking me and moving on we've got
7510720	7511360	a question
7516720	7523920	lord dairy is wrong with you guys uh d-a-r-r-y lord dairy asks is jeremy pettymore still alive
7524800	7532640	no right like no like no no like no he dead john lee pettymore shot him in the head
7533360	7539920	yeah i answered uh one of my favorite moments from this podcast that ending to that was so
7539920	7546640	fucking well done i had not planned that in any way and when thomas and i were role playing it it
7546640	7555440	just fucking happened and i was on the edge of my seat with what he was going to do next and with
7555440	7560640	what happened i was just so fucking so that's one of those moments in role playing where you just
7562320	7567920	it's three eighths of a sneeze three eighths of a sneeze three sneezes
7567920	7571760	three eighths of a sneeze is so much less
7574400	7582400	guys sneezing is so much better than role playing i swear uh so at ripsaw underscore unicorn applied
7582400	7589200	with uh pet pics and a question uh those pets were very adorable and they ask a question that
7589200	7595680	i cannot answer what anime tropes do y'all feel each player character would fall into you know
7595760	7602480	how in some anime in some animes uh like they're in a fight and they keep revealing more and more
7602480	7606720	powers and they're like getting stronger and stronger keith would be like the opposite of
7606720	7611920	that where he just keeps doing stupider and stupider and stupider so keith keith would be
7611920	7616000	like the anime character who just like is constantly eating all the time and that's
7616000	7624880	their only like yeah that's the brad pitt anime john lee pettymore is not an anime trope is is
7624880	7630560	the best way i can put it everybody who's he's just not serious enough as a person
7631200	7635920	in the way that everyone in fucking anime is about every little fucking thing they do
7635920	7641920	whoa wow such harsh language it's just uh it's just a little theatrical for me
7643760	7650080	that's weird plus like plus i can't uh yeah i don't know i love theater clark bishops would
7650080	7659680	be having huge titties yeah clark bishop yeah got them anime titties dig it
7662480	7667040	i i don't watch like any anime so i will defer to you guys on what my trope would be i don't
7667040	7671760	know what anime tropes there are i feel like a lot of our characters don't obey a lot of traditional
7671760	7679200	anime tropes generally it's tonally so not that john lee pettymore i feel like is like the badass
7679200	7684800	character that a lot of animes have yeah but that that badass character is always like has
7684800	7691600	this dark past that they're like trying to atone for or like get revenge for or something yeah
7691600	7698000	and john lee pettymore is just here to fucking ride wild yeah pretty much he just wants to now
7698000	7703520	that he has five million dollars yeah he's just a dude running around in his dad's body
7703760	7713040	that'll animate i am my dad like john lee pettymore looks down he's looking at a dick
7713040	7722000	that's fucked his mom that's cool wow nice holy shit clark has the like dead parents anime trope
7722000	7728320	oh that is true yeah you're the protagonist of every anime he's also the protagonist in this
7728400	7730160	he's also the protagonist of the story
7731680	7735920	okay that's my that's if that's true then why do i have the theme song the theme song is about
7735920	7745920	thomas but the story is about joe and luke is uh keith is there there scraping by you're all
7745920	7752080	very important i hope you know that uh so we've got another one here from at stories colossal
7752800	7758640	says if you guys were playing with bonds in the main timeline bonds is a mechanic in delta green
7758640	7766400	where uh you lose and gain a good relationship with three or four different people two to four
7766400	7772160	different people in your life and you can like basically your sanity uh is affected
7772720	7778240	or affects those relationships so who would they be for each of the pcs uh we started to
7778240	7783600	touch on it i think in one episode and we i decided that clark is a real sad lonely guy
7783600	7789920	so his bonds would be like the checkout guy at the grocery store who is in a dream of yours yep
7790720	7796400	and uh probably maggie if if that was a thing that you could do have a bond with somebody who
7796400	7801680	isn't in the story much totally like that would be definitely one of his bonds when we were thinking
7801680	7806400	about maybe even having pawns i think as a mechanic i think john lee pettymore was going
7806400	7813280	to use just the extended pettymore family as a bond and then like as as he called on them to do
7813280	7818240	different things obviously that relationship would get strained as more of them were like taken by
7818240	7824000	supernatural horrors but but thinking about it now john lee pettymore definitely has like an
7824000	7829760	ex-girlfriend who got tired of his shit but still cares for him that like if shit really went down
7829760	7834640	he could be like shit like fuck and call her but she definitely doesn't want to be a part of his
7834640	7842800	life on a day-to-day basis anymore oh for keith uh he's never dated anybody he killed his brother
7843760	7851520	doesn't have much family to speak of so his one and only bond would be no spoilers
7852560	7856320	i mean if they're listening to this they just listen to everything else i'm kidding
7856320	7863600	uh so it would be bean my dog uh which leads us into the last question which is a very good
7863600	7871680	question and it was brought up on the discord uh pretty recently and crush posted in the uh
7871680	7880480	in the question thread what happened to keith's dog and then uh bx borei 9181 who is currently
7880480	7887360	doing a re-listen while taking notes and posting the notes in the subreddit which is dope uh very
7887360	7892960	cool and fun to fun to watch uh i think she might have even been the one who posted it in the
7892960	7898640	discord but anyway uh she said also if keith was in the city before coming home to contention
7898640	7905360	how did he miss all those dirty dog grooming locations especially since he had a dog um okay
7905360	7912640	so what happened to keith's dog he is happily at at home in the motel hotel motel i'm sure
7912640	7919120	it's only been a couple days he can fend for himself it's been five days yep yeah what if
7919680	7925120	what if like uh maybe he was running around in the creek bed having fun with all the other dogs
7925120	7932480	okay so guys he probably tore into that dead in a hotel room no he torn in my big bag of dog food
7932480	7939200	and then chewed his way out of the hotel room and is swimming with the fishes
7942160	7946080	and his and his stomach burst because of all the food he ate and now he's dead
7946640	7950800	no he's alive i would hope we haven't been to contention in a while so i've got to check on
7950800	7960400	him he should call him come here bean what do you guys think about playing animals in contention
7961040	7971120	for like uh one hour one shot you guys play animals in contention who have to save bean from
7971120	7977440	the room that he's locked in in hotel motel the stakes are simply too high uh
7978720	7985520	the emotional devastation if we didn't like yeah if we didn't save beans and also it's not one hour
7985520	7993120	it's an entire campaign also we're starting it now and it's as long as the quarantine is
7996160	7998720	and if you go to sleep i'll come over to your house and kill you
8001360	8008720	what uh yeah you know you gotta keep playing continually yeah you can never stop oh no
8010080	8016080	never stop never stopping bro uh so i will come up with a like uh you said you will come
8018720	8025200	and i only speak the truth uh right and you guys will play different animals who are in contention
8025840	8035120	and we'll uh we'll see what happened to old bean okay cool i'm warning you now if it's not
8036160	8042480	if it's not him if it's not alive yeah we will come kill zach yeah six feet
8045040	8051040	we can shoot you yeah we can kill you from six feet away oh god i don't like that
8051360	8058240	well yeah you know you best not fuck with the dog now you know where you fucking stand
8060080	8064960	okay lower than an imaginary dog the mechanics of this game are pretty simple
8064960	8072720	uh if i ask you to roll you succeed good that's right to answer this question though uh
8072720	8079280	keith is fucking stupid and he just gave his dog baths in his in his own house yeah i like to think
8079280	8084240	that keith is such a good dog owner that he didn't need a grooming place my dog is grooms
8084240	8091120	himself and he proved in the story how good of a dog owner he was yeah i mean i didn't know i was
8091120	8101120	gonna get shipped off to the city okay so far ahead uh this has been the q and a uh episode
