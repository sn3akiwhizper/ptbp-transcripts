0	7320	Howdy my cowpups, it's your radio sheriff, Wolf the dog, and I'm wrangling up all of
7320	12880	contention's juicy news from 694.2 PTBP.
12880	16640	First up, a word with some friends on howlin' with Wolf.
16640	21640	Your wolf brother Lord Morty wants to give a shoutout to all his dogs over at the discord
21640	24840	server for the good friends of Jackson Elias.
24840	30020	If you pups aren't part of the pack already, it's a place where you can yip, yap, wolf,
30020	36320	or whimper about Call of Cthulhu, horror films, or horror gaming in general.
36320	42140	Just dig out your doggy device, download the discord app, and search for the good friends
42140	44320	of Jackson Elias.
44320	50100	Keep those claws sharp and those canines sharper, see you wolf pups around.
50260	54860	Now while this is a note from the producer, the good friends of Jackson Elias have been
54860	59720	an integral part of this keeper's horror and roleplay education, if you're willing
59720	62740	to lose some sanity along the way.
62740	67860	And Scott Dorward, one of the good friends, was even kind enough to reply to this producer's
67860	75220	reddit post regarding running his outstanding scenario, Hell in Texas, found in Stygian
75220	80300	Fox's reality-breaking book, The Things We Leave Behind.
80300	84860	If y'all want your best friend Wolf to read something you got to say, leave us a sweet
84860	91060	five star review or tag us in a social media thing, y'all know the drill.
91060	94380	And now we got a little news on the wire.
94380	99140	Last I heard, Officer Vigna and the two other idiots busted into the deceased child's
99140	105100	room at Hotel Motel, guns drawn, and sans warrant.
105100	110660	There they found a woman dressed similarly to her favorite TV character, the Fonz.
110660	115620	But let me tell y'all, these were not happy days as she whipped a knife out at Officer
115620	120140	Vigna after these so-called peacekeepers pulled the guns out.
120140	123060	Guns are scary, y'all.
123060	127900	The party had Greece and Professor Trelawney pinned down until the brilliant Keith Vigna
127900	133900	engaged her in hand-to-hand combat, resulting in a hostage situation for the copper.
133900	139220	Vigna, an officer of the law, proceeded to brag about killing a coworker.
139220	144420	But I heard the sweet-talkin' officer bishop managed to keep her from killin' him there
144420	145980	on the spot.
145980	150180	And now when that old wired lady made a run for it over the railin' and ran into the
150180	156260	parking lot, all three of those officers unloaded their weapons from the second floor corridor,
156260	159820	bringin' her down before she could get into her vehicle.
159820	165860	The officers patched her up and sent her to the city hospital with Lauren, the only
165860	169100	decent officer left in contention.
169100	174660	The scene was so dramatic for everyone stayin' at Hotel Motel, owners say they will likely
174660	179380	have to shut down soon due to the negative reviews on Yelp.
179380	184660	The officers are plannin' a sting operation to catch Billy Harrison, the stranger runnin'
184660	187780	about contention in an official police uniform.
188780	189780	What?
189780	190780	Wait a minute.
190780	196460	Well, if we only get to listen to one song before some bald dude dressed as a cock comes
196460	203260	and we all get got, let it be kudzu with no backbone.
218780	219780	Hey Drew!
225780	232300	Okay, so after about 15 minutes, a black SUV rolls up and parks a block away from the donut
232300	233300	hole.
233300	238900	A very short, young woman and a very tall, old man get out and they are both wearing
238900	244700	a black suit, white shirt, black tie, black sunglasses, and an ill-fitting windbreaker
244700	248620	that says FBI in big letters across the back.
248620	254220	Clark, as you sip on your coffee, you hear the door behind you swing open.
254220	258340	The door chimes jingle and jangle and you hear footsteps.
258340	264020	Out of the corner of your eye, you see a short, young woman walk across the shop to the counter.
264020	266740	The other footsteps approach you from behind.
266740	269940	Wait, uh, John has his radio on him, but do you?
269940	270940	No.
270940	273620	You're all in plainclothes and I think at this point you were texting information.
273620	279220	Okay, so I'm gonna text both of them, hey, it's not Billy, but it's two, what looked
279220	281860	like two FBI agents just walked in.
281860	282860	Send.
282860	284220	Could you sext me that instead?
284220	286060	Hey baby.
286060	288500	Some female body inspectors just walked in.
291500	293780	Clark, do you want to make any moves?
293780	294980	One was approaching me.
294980	297340	There are footsteps that approach you from behind.
297340	299300	Someone is clearly like standing behind you.
299300	300700	I think you had your newspaper up.
300700	302700	Yeah, are they like standing behind me?
302780	303780	Yep.
303780	304780	Okay.
304780	305780	I turn around and look up at them.
305780	307940	It's this, uh, older dude.
307940	314780	He's quite tall and he's pretty gruff looking and he just stares back down at you and his
314780	316780	eyes are empty.
316780	320260	Can I, can I help you?
320260	322460	He stares.
322460	326500	I slowly turn back around and refocus on the newspaper.
326500	332260	As you're focused on the newspaper, you still hear this guy breathing behind you and the
332300	337580	woman at the counter, she orders something from the guy behind the counter there.
337580	338580	What's his name?
338580	339580	Right?
339580	340580	The donut hole.
340580	341580	Yeah.
341580	342580	His name is Duncan.
342580	343580	Duncan Hole.
343580	346580	Mr. Mr. Hole, Mr. Duncan Hole.
346580	347580	Yo, Mr. H.
347580	356740	He, uh, pours her a coffee and she walks and sits at the booth with Clark Bishop across
356740	357940	from you.
357940	364460	And she says, okay, John, where's the bag?
364460	365460	Are you talking to me?
365460	366460	Yeah.
366460	370420	I'm not, I'm not John.
370420	371580	Are you looking for John?
371580	372580	Are you not John?
372580	373580	I'm not John.
373580	378700	Uh, well, you're wearing a hoodie and uh, you know, we just thought that you were John.
378700	380100	No, I'm not John.
380100	381100	Do you know John?
381100	382100	Uh, John what?
382100	383100	John Peters.
383100	384100	Hmm.
384100	385100	I've heard that name before.
385100	386100	Huh.
386260	390340	The man behind you, he puts a hand on your shoulder.
390340	394740	I pet it.
394740	397980	She says, we need you to direct us to John Peters.
397980	401380	I don't, I don't know where John Peters is.
401380	402380	Who are you?
402380	403740	Uh, my name's Clark.
403740	404740	Clark what?
404740	405740	Clark Bishop.
405740	406740	Clark Bishop.
406740	407740	What do you do?
407740	410300	Uh, I actually happen to be a officer here in this town.
410300	411300	Oh, of course.
411300	412300	Yes.
412300	413300	Of course.
413300	414300	You're officer Bishop.
414300	415300	Oh, that's right.
415500	417580	Um, where's John Peters then?
417580	418580	You should know.
418580	422660	No, uh, man, we don't know.
422660	427460	Do you have anything for us?
427460	431620	I mean, if you hadn't walked in here, we might have had something.
431620	437540	Me and my, uh, my fellow officers, this is kind of a, we're curious about John too.
437540	438540	We're working on it though.
438540	443300	I'll tell you what, more specifically than John Peters, we're looking for a bag.
443300	444300	What kind of bag?
444300	445900	It's a black Nike bag.
445900	449340	It was in a storage unit here in contention and we're looking for it.
449340	450340	Huh.
450340	451700	Uh, what would be in the bag?
451700	452700	Nothing.
452700	454340	Well, we'll keep an eye out for it.
454340	456340	That's for dang sure.
456340	459420	Okay, well.
459420	466260	Hey, off character, off conversation, did we find that in the storage locker?
466260	467260	Yeah.
467260	468260	What was in it?
468260	469580	The cocaine or is it literally a bag of nothing?
469580	471380	There's literally a Nike bag.
471380	472740	Oh shit.
472740	473740	Is that in the-
473780	475020	Is there something horrifying in it?
475020	476020	Did we open it?
476020	480100	I think Clark opened it and he's asked what was inside and I told him there's nothing
480100	482060	in there.
482060	483780	I want to look in the Nike bag.
483780	485100	There's nothing in there.
485100	487780	Is there anything in the leather backpack?
487780	488780	Is it at the prison?
488780	489780	At the jail?
489780	493860	Yeah, it's, it's like in the police department, locked up in one of the cells with all the
493860	495580	other stuff.
495580	497540	Is there a reason you're looking for an empty bag?
497540	499820	You know, I think that's above your pay grade.
499820	500820	Oh, is it?
500820	501820	Oh, definitely.
501900	504260	I mean, he's just a missing person at this point, right?
504260	508580	We're not looking for him necessarily, but we thought that he could take us to the bag.
508580	511940	John Peters had the keys for those storage units.
511940	514340	We went by those storage units.
514340	515340	They're empty.
515340	516340	Hmm.
516340	517340	How about that?
517340	519940	Can I, can I hear this on the, in the bathroom?
519940	520940	Yeee, roll.
520940	521940	Yes, roll.
521940	522940	Uh, alertness.
522940	523940	Uh, 87.
523940	528060	I forgot to take my headphones out.
528060	529140	What are you listening to?
529140	530980	Like a conspiracy theory podcast?
530980	531980	Yeah.
531980	532980	Natch.
532980	533980	Niberia.
533980	538460	I'm just failing to understand how a guy from my town missing an empty bag is above
538460	539460	my pay grade.
539460	540460	Yeah.
540460	541460	I'm trying to help.
541460	542460	Okay.
542460	545780	Well, if you don't know any more information, then you can't be of any help, can you?
545780	547700	I guess, I guess not.
547700	550680	How about if I find that bag, I'll give you guys a call.
550680	552420	We would certainly appreciate it.
552420	556420	But since we're here talking to an officer of the law, I think you might be able to help
556420	559980	us out with some information about some things that are happening in this town.
559980	565180	You see, we know about the body in the junkyard and we know about the chopped up body in the
565180	568660	plastic trunk with the woman's head that was split open.
568660	573260	We're also pretty sure that you killed a man named Charles earlier this evening.
573260	577260	And I believe you also shot a woman at hotel motel earlier tonight.
577260	583980	So I think maybe officer Bishop, you're not in much of a place to say what should be done
583980	584980	next.
584980	585980	Oh boy.
585980	586980	In character.
586980	587980	No, for real.
587980	588980	For real.
588980	589980	Just like, uh-uh.
589980	590980	No, no you.
590980	592980	You didn't, how'd you hear about that?
592980	597980	That head in a bucket thing, what's that about?
597980	603860	Well, you sent off some stuff to county, didn't you?
603860	606560	We talked to them and they won't be talking anymore.
606560	607560	County won't be talking?
607560	608560	We didn't kill them.
608560	611980	No, we just, there are certain things that need to be kept away from the knowledge of
611980	612980	the people.
612980	613980	That's one of them.
613980	617940	Clark, Bishop, they told you about the difference between the age of the inside and the age
617940	620300	of the outside of the corpse from the junkyard, did they not?
620300	621580	Yeah, about that lab fuckup?
621580	622980	Yeah, they told me about that.
622980	624340	That's a big oopsie on their part.
624340	627460	Yeah, they're clearly not very good at their jobs.
627460	630460	Now I'll ask you one more time, officer Bishop.
630460	634020	Do you know anything about this black Nike bag that we look for?
634020	636460	Because we're not leaving this town until we find it?
636460	637460	Agent, uh...
637460	641100	Kennedy, this is my partner, Agent McKinley.
641100	645220	And you kind of look over and he nods at you, he looks down, he nods.
645220	646820	He's still holding your shoulder.
646820	647820	What does this guy look like?
647820	648820	I'm imagining like a-
648820	653700	Old dude with empty eyes and like a tanned leather skin.
653700	656540	Oh, I seem like a John Malkovich, but...
656540	662600	Well, the woman that's talking is really young and really short and she's just kind of like
662600	664820	bright eyed, bushy tail, weird voice.
664820	665820	Like a squirrel.
665820	667660	Yeah, she's very similar to a squirrel.
667740	672180	Like a Scottish squirrel or Canadian, whatever she, whatever accent she's got.
672180	673180	A Scottish Canadian girl?
673180	674180	Where the fuck is she from?
674180	675180	Ireland?
675180	679180	Shit, you haven't talked about that yet.
679180	684060	Yeah, Agent Kennedy, Agent McKinley.
684060	688380	I do know some stuff that's been going on around here that's honestly, it's just real
688380	689380	weird.
689380	693140	The reason I wasn't totally forthcoming with you is I don't know exactly what the hell's
693140	694140	going on.
694380	700060	And we've been playing it tight to the chest so far because boy, we might be in a little
700060	701520	over our heads at this point.
701520	704780	At this point I am texting, what are they asking?
704780	707380	What do they know?
707380	708460	You get that text.
708460	711020	And she says, are we keeping you from something more important?
711020	713740	I mean, we had a sting set up for tonight.
713740	714940	That's kind of what this all was.
714940	716660	That's why I'm not wearing my uniform right now.
716660	719180	Oh, this was a sting operation you say?
719180	720180	Yeah.
720180	723180	You walked in with the FBI thing on your jacket, which kind of fucked all that up.
723220	729500	Well, we were also looking for John Peters and we were also listening, so I guess we've
729500	730500	been stung.
730500	732020	I guess we stung you on that one, didn't we?
732020	733260	I guess the plan kind of worked.
733260	734260	I suppose in a way.
734260	735440	Who are you looking for?
735440	737620	What bee were you hoping to grab the end of?
737620	745140	Earlier this evening, one of my associates was injured in a little incident at the hospital
745140	751580	up there and a guy we had in custody kind of got the better of him, took his uniform.
751780	753540	And so we were trying to catch him.
753540	755300	We were trying to get him back here.
759180	763660	So there is a civilian running about in a contention police officer's clothes.
763660	766060	Listen, I told you we were in over our heads.
766060	767860	I'm not proud of everything that's happened tonight.
767860	771460	You guys really seem to have the top on this whole situation, don't you?
771460	773700	I mean, we had a sting set up.
773700	774700	We were on it.
774700	776700	Well, sorry.
776700	778700	That's okay.
781700	782700	Ding.
784700	785700	Oh boy.
786700	789700	Give me a hit of that vape while we're at it.
789700	791700	You guys want to hear that annoying sound?
791700	792700	Yeah.
797700	800700	It's hard to talk and not cough with this in your mouth.
800700	802700	I had a dollar every time your mom said that.
802700	806180	How many dollars would you have?
806180	810180	So Joe is a little bit at a loss, but I think it's because Clark would be at a little bit
810180	811180	of a loss.
811780	815020	I don't know where I stand with these guys at fucking all because I think we're past
815020	816580	the point of like lying to them.
816580	820900	Well, we're past the point of like our characters being like trying to be good policemen.
820900	825700	You have committed, we've all committed like super felonies, but I think that also is why
825700	830100	Clark is in like a, Oh, cause he's like wants to help out, but he's like, uh, I will go
830100	831100	to jail for sure.
831100	835100	He was a good cop 24 hours ago, whatever it was.
835100	837500	It should have been me cause I would have had no problem lying to him.
837820	841620	I would just have a problem lying to him.
841620	845420	It's like 1am on December 4th, the morning of December 4th now.
845420	849580	And this all started the evening of December 1st so it really hasn't been very much time
849580	850580	at all.
850580	851580	Yeah.
851580	852580	What do they expect from us?
852580	853580	What are we, the FBI?
853580	855820	Are you, uh, you folks, uh, you guys in town for a while?
855820	859100	Officer Bishop, we're in town for as long as we need to be good.
859100	863380	How about we all go home, get a good night's sleep and I'll share with you all we've got
863380	865540	so far tomorrow at the station.
865540	873500	Don't persuade because they would rather go to the station right now.
873500	875380	What the fuck dude?
875380	876380	Yes.
876380	879580	I don't know what to do.
879580	882140	That's that's that's a set that I don't ever use.
882140	885820	That's the third set that you've rolled a not one with in this game.
885820	886820	Stop apologizing.
886820	887820	Your hands are touched by God.
887820	889220	I just feel bad narratively.
889220	890580	Like I'm winning every time.
890580	895500	Just tell them that we're all losing willpower right now and we need to take it.
895500	898800	Mechanically it would be better for all of us if we met in the morning.
898800	905540	She looks at agent McKinley and looks back at you and she says, fair enough.
905540	907020	What time shall we meet in the morning?
907020	908540	How about a 10 o'clock?
908540	914620	We'll see you bright and early at 10 o'clock and agent McKinley and agent Kennedy walk
914620	916220	out of the donut hole.
916220	917500	Which one was Kennedy?
917500	923980	Kennedy was the female woman from agent Kennedy was the short one, the young woman from the
923980	927140	agent McKinley was the, uh, the tall old man.
927140	928140	Oh, sure.
928140	929140	Where do you think she was born?
929140	930140	What abouts?
930140	931140	God.
931140	932140	Who knows?
932140	933140	Guys?
933140	937580	I got, I thought of this one, you know, all the, like the black goo we've been seeing.
937580	942660	It's CPD oil, like contention, police department.
942660	944860	That's not a very good one.
944860	949500	There's not a whole lot there.
949500	953820	And edit point and cut.
953820	954820	I think.
954820	955820	Yeah.
955820	956820	That's let's in an episode right there.
956820	963740	CPD oil, and then we'll end it before the punchline and pick up next week with oil real
963740	974140	quick and then it'll be 10 am, but not that, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no snacks.
974140	979880	As soon as those two leave, I'm furiously texting those guys or you guys furiously.
979880	980880	What do you say?
980880	981880	Oh shit.
982800	983800	The FBI is here.
983800	984800	They talked to me.
984800	985800	We got to get together.
985800	986800	Come to the car.
986800	987800	I send back.
987800	988800	And I do.
988800	992280	And so I walk out of the bathroom and nobody's left in the restaurant and I mean, I'm coming
992280	997020	to the car, but I'm still a little like, wow, I could have waited for him.
997020	998040	You guys hop in the car.
998040	1004320	So the FBI is here and they seem to know a lot, in fact, maybe more than we do about
1004320	1006080	all this crazy shit that's been happening.
1006080	1007080	What do they know?
1007080	1010120	They know about the storage units and a lot of the crazy shit.
1010160	1012240	Do they know that we have the stuff in the storage units?
1012240	1015860	I wasn't forthright with that, but by the end of it, it seems like they pretty much
1015860	1016860	know that we do.
1016860	1017860	Okay.
1017860	1018860	Wow.
1018860	1019860	Okay.
1019860	1020860	So we should get back to the PD and...
1020860	1023840	So they're going to come by tomorrow morning at 10 and I told them we cooperate.
1023840	1027160	We need to stash that stuff, yeah, but we're keeping that cool shit, right?
1027160	1028600	Or do we cooperate with them?
1028600	1029600	No.
1029600	1031780	We cooperate, but they don't know we did it.
1031780	1039940	We took cocaine and didn't report it to anybody and tons of illegal weapons, but they knew
1039940	1041700	that we killed Charles.
1041700	1042700	They knew...
1042700	1048900	Yeah, but all the murders, I mean, all the things we had to do, we had to do on official
1048900	1049900	police business.
1049900	1050900	Of course.
1050900	1051900	And we would explain that to them.
1051900	1054900	I'm just saying that they're aware of us potentially being off the deep end.
1054900	1059340	Yeah, well, maybe we send them off the deep end and get the whole FBI after.
1059340	1060340	Wow.
1060340	1063340	I think we got your head in the wrong place about this whole murder thing.
1063340	1067800	So how do you think they know that we have all the...
1067800	1069540	They mentioned that head in the tub.
1069540	1070900	Did they know what else was in the unit?
1070900	1071900	Did they mention that?
1071900	1072900	Yeah.
1072900	1074020	They're looking for a black Nike bag.
1074020	1078860	So they didn't mention cocaine or machine guns or sniper rifles?
1078860	1083500	So they know that the storage units were cleared out and they knew that John was supposed to
1083500	1084500	have the keys to them.
1084500	1087140	Okay, we found the Nike bag in the hotel room.
1087140	1088460	Yeah, let's give them the Nike bag.
1088460	1092640	And we didn't think, you know, until you knew who they were, we weren't going to just give
1092640	1093640	it over.
1093640	1094640	You know what I mean?
1094640	1097740	We can say, I've got the Nike bag and then let's stash all the rest of the stuff somewhere
1097740	1098740	else.
1098740	1100180	Cause I'm not looking to go to jail for...
1100180	1101180	Or at John...
1101180	1102500	We found it somewhere.
1102500	1105660	Maybe we went and poked around John Peter's house again and there it was.
1105660	1106660	Who knows?
1106660	1107660	I'm just saying...
1107660	1108660	Let's lie.
1108660	1109660	I'm saying let's lie.
1109660	1110660	Cause I don't want to go to jail.
1110660	1111940	Give up all that cocaine.
1111940	1112940	Yeah.
1112940	1113940	But where can we put it?
1113940	1117580	Back in the storage units?
1117580	1118780	The last place they'll look.
1118780	1120200	Real fuck with them.
1120200	1122980	Do you think we should cooperate with them on the bag?
1122980	1125100	Cause that's of no use to us right now.
1125100	1126100	It's just an empty bag.
1126100	1128300	I want to look at that bag now.
1128300	1131100	Let's go back to the PD and figure out what we're going to do from there.
1131100	1132580	Also, have they left yet?
1132580	1133580	Yes.
1133580	1135220	Okay, let's all go back to the police department and...
1135220	1136220	It's right across the street.
1136220	1137220	We can see it.
1137220	1138220	Okay, let's go.
1138220	1140220	We're back.
1140220	1148740	An odd thing awaits you when you walk into the police department.
1148740	1149740	Not Drew.
1149740	1152740	Drew is not at the police department.
1152740	1156340	Well, we need to change that because somebody's going to have to move all this stuff.
1156340	1157340	It's late.
1157340	1158340	It's not going to be us.
1158340	1161980	When's the last time you didn't see Drew when you were here?
1161980	1163500	What do we see?
1163500	1170500	There is just a note on Drew's desk and it says, went to the chief's house, we'll be
1170500	1171500	back.
1171500	1172500	Is it Drew's handwriting?
1172500	1173500	Yep.
1173500	1174500	Is there time or anything on it?
1174500	1175500	Nope.
1175500	1176500	Okay.
1176500	1179540	And as you guys walk in, Dr. Marie Jacobs stirs from her cell in the back and she's
1179540	1186740	like, hey Marie, doctor, shouldn't you be asleep right now?
1186740	1189180	Shouldn't you be officer-ing?
1189180	1190180	We are.
1190180	1191180	We happen to be officer-ing.
1191180	1193460	This is our office to officer at.
1193460	1195080	Shh, you'll wake him.
1195080	1199160	And Salem is like asleep on her, on her lap.
1199160	1201140	It's your shrill ass who's going to wake him.
1201140	1203340	He doesn't wake up to my voice.
1203340	1205940	It's just stranger's voices.
1205940	1209500	The way the police department is set up, can you see into the cells and stuff as soon as
1209500	1210500	you walk in?
1210500	1215560	No, but you could hear voices echoing in such a way that like you can definitely tell it's
1215560	1221480	hitting bags of cocaine and weapons and they would just have to take a quick look around
1221480	1222480	to find all that shit.
1222480	1223480	Right.
1223480	1224480	Oh yeah.
1224480	1225480	Yeah.
1225480	1227560	It would be five steps into the back room and you'd be like, Oh, there's a lot of stuff
1227560	1228560	back here.
1228560	1229560	Yeah.
1229560	1230560	Okay.
1230560	1231560	We don't want that to happen.
1231560	1235780	I'm imagining that each cell is individually barred from the front.
1235780	1241060	However, they are separated in an opaque fashion from cell to cell.
1241060	1246020	How long would it take us to put up some, uh, like a false wall, dry wall, just thinking
1246020	1247020	some dry wall around.
1247020	1250260	We move it all into the last cell and put up a fake wall.
1250260	1251260	Fuck this guys.
1251260	1252260	Let's just text Drew.
1252260	1253260	Let's call Drew.
1253260	1254260	Okay.
1254260	1255260	Yeah.
1255260	1264780	Hey, this is a Drew Andrews.
1264780	1266260	Give a message after the beep.
1266260	1267260	Thank you.
1267260	1268260	Bye.
1268260	1269260	Click.
1269260	1270260	I don't leave fucking voicemails.
1270260	1271260	It's a text message in world.
1271260	1272260	Uh, he wasn't around.
1272260	1273260	Okay.
1273260	1274260	What do you think?
1274260	1275900	I think priority number one is get our goodies somewhere else.
1275900	1277460	Where do we put them all?
1277460	1278460	At your house.
1278460	1279460	Oh shit.
1279460	1280460	Yeah.
1280460	1281460	Yeah.
1281460	1282460	Yeah.
1282460	1285060	Uh, you live the farthest out of town, don't you?
1285060	1286060	Okay.
1286060	1287060	Let's put them at your house.
1287060	1288060	We could do that.
1288060	1289060	We could nimby it up.
1289060	1290060	I'll just take a little bit of home.
1290060	1292340	I live at a motel right now.
1292340	1296420	And there's a scene of the crime a few doors down for me.
1296420	1297420	Maybe not.
1297420	1298420	Maybe not in my room.
1298420	1299420	You guys could split it up.
1299420	1301860	Like maybe John Lee Pettymore could take all the guns.
1301860	1306420	Clark could take all the cocaine or just switch those, swap those right around.
1306420	1307420	Yeah.
1307420	1308420	That sounds good to me.
1308420	1309420	That all does sound good to me.
1309420	1312300	It's just that realistically that's a, we have, there's so much shit in those storage
1312300	1313300	lockers.
1313300	1314580	Like we just kind of montage this.
1314580	1315860	I've already got the cocaine.
1315860	1316860	I'll see you later.
1316860	1319460	We probably still have the U-Haul, right?
1319460	1320460	Yeah.
1320460	1322420	The police U-Haul.
1322420	1324540	You've got some sort of police U-Haul.
1324540	1325540	Box trucks.
1325540	1327260	Can we just montage that real quick?
1327260	1330940	It is 1am when this started.
1330940	1334140	So it's at least 1.30 now.
1334140	1335140	Maybe two.
1335140	1340380	So I'm going to have you guys all lose another willpower point if you're going to keep going.
1340380	1341380	What's everybody at?
1341380	1342380	Seven.
1342380	1343380	Nine.
1343380	1344380	I'm at nine.
1344380	1345660	So how long is this going to take us to do?
1345660	1346660	Two hours.
1346660	1348900	So it's 3.30 once we get back to the police department.
1348900	1351460	Yeah, you'll lose two more willpower points.
1351460	1353620	I'm definitely, I may not.
1353620	1355300	We can regain them by sleeping and stuff, right?
1355300	1357140	Yeah, I'm not heading back to the police department.
1357140	1360020	A full night's sleep gives you 1D6 willpower.
1360020	1363220	Okay, so let's, we'll take it to the respective places and meet back up.
1363220	1366500	How about we meet back up at like an hour before they get here?
1366500	1368060	I mean, yeah, eight o'clock, whatever.
1368060	1369460	Yeah, let's get here at eight.
1369460	1372420	That way we have a couple hours to talk about what the hell we're going to do.
1372420	1374820	Okay guys, we're going to get to work on time and then...
1374820	1375820	Plan.
1375820	1376820	Plot.
1377340	1378340	I think we're plotting.
1378340	1379340	This is fine.
1379340	1380340	Yeah.
1380340	1385900	Okay, so real quick, if we're going to montage through these, let's go ahead and get a quick
1385900	1388700	rundown of where everything is going.
1388700	1393540	Oh shit, wait, at some point in the two hours, we would definitely realize that we should
1393540	1397180	check up on Drew at the chief's house, especially since he doesn't call us back.
1397180	1400460	If you guys are taking this stuff to your house, I can go to the chief's house.
1400460	1403660	I think it would be a really good idea for Keith to split off by himself.
1403660	1412700	I mean, especially, okay, yeah, I call him one more time.
1412700	1413700	Same thing.
1413700	1417420	Okay, I guess I'm going to go to the chief's house while you guys get all this back to
1417420	1418420	your houses.
1418420	1419420	Good night, Keith.
1419420	1420420	Good luck, man.
1420420	1421420	Oh, I don't need it.
1421420	1427500	I mean, you haven't used any luck so far, so real quick, Clark and John, who is taking
1427500	1429460	what to your respective homes?
1429460	1431500	I mean, there is a shitload of shit in there.
1431500	1437380	I want to take all of the important documents we found and I'll take some of the guns or
1437380	1438620	all the guns either way.
1438620	1442620	You take some of the guns, I'll take some of the guns.
1442620	1446180	We wouldn't want a man like you wanted up, caught with all that cocaine.
1446180	1449820	You know, the Pennymores, I can just say it was left on the property, you know what I
1449820	1450820	mean?
1450820	1451820	Yeah.
1451820	1452820	Yeah.
1452820	1453820	Thanks for doing that for me, John.
1453820	1454820	No worries, man.
1454820	1455820	I got your back, brother.
1455820	1456820	I don't want to get penalized for forgetting what all-
1456820	1457820	Absolutely.
1457820	1458820	You won't be.
1458820	1459820	We'll take everything, yeah.
1459820	1460820	How about that?
1461140	1464340	We'll take everything unless there's something that you would think that we should talk about
1464340	1465340	who gets.
1465340	1466340	Yeah.
1466340	1467340	What are the other important things?
1467340	1468340	How about this?
1468340	1469340	John takes half the guns and all the cocaine.
1469340	1471220	You take the other half of guns and everything else.
1471220	1473380	The question is what's in everything else?
1473380	1476620	Is the cursed turtle we found going to explode or something that we forgot about?
1476620	1482940	The cursed turtle will explode, which will be an issue for you specifically as a character.
1482940	1487460	Also how about I take the empty bag, throw it in the trunk of my cruiser.
1487460	1490740	That way I can be like, you can act like you had no idea about it.
1491660	1493100	That's a really good idea.
1493100	1500660	You know what, relying on your incompetence as an alibi is the least incompetent idea
1500660	1501660	you've ever had.
1501660	1503140	Thank you so much, guys.
1503140	1506340	But real fast, I want to take a look at it here right now.
1506340	1507340	Yeah, let's look at the bag.
1507340	1510460	You guys go in the back and you find a black Nike bag.
1510460	1513380	It's a drawstring bag like you would take to the gym.
1513380	1517060	It has a Nike swish on it and it says Nike on it.
1517060	1518060	Nothing inside.
1518060	1519060	Nick.
1519060	1520060	There's nothing inside.
1520380	1521380	Is there anything in the office that I can run over?
1521380	1522380	I'm sure we do.
1522380	1524020	I'm sure we have a wand of some kind.
1524020	1525020	Yeah.
1525020	1526020	There's so much metal.
1526020	1527780	I pointed Breathalyzer at it.
1527780	1528780	In the bag.
1528780	1529860	There's a metal in the bag.
1529860	1533100	If you swipe it over the top of it, there's a lot of metal in the bag.
1533100	1534580	What does that mean to us though?
1534580	1535980	So when I look into it though, it's empty?
1535980	1536980	Yeah, it's black.
1536980	1537980	It's empty.
1537980	1540780	And it feels just like a regular empty drawstring bag.
1540780	1541780	Spitball in here.
1541780	1543180	Maybe you can catch the goo with it.
1543180	1544180	Maybe.
1544180	1545180	We can talk about it more in the morning.
1545180	1547180	I cast ritual detect magic.
1547180	1553180	Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your spellcasting modifier.
1553180	1554180	Alrighty.
1554180	1555180	Nat 20.
1555180	1556180	Whoa.
1556180	1562580	You needed a 40.
1562580	1565340	We all watch Clark do that.
1565340	1570300	Just, hey buddy, I think you need to get, I think you should get some sleep.
1570300	1577140	Go ahead and roll a sanity test for me as you pass the wand over the top of the bag.
1577140	1579100	That's a 94 on a 42.
1579100	1583260	Okay, you just lose one and you know something's up.
1583260	1584580	Something's up with this bag.
1584580	1585900	What's up with that?
1585900	1586900	Yo, so should we?
1586900	1588420	Yeah, what's up with that?
1588420	1590460	Should we keep it or should we hand it over?
1590460	1593660	That's kind of what I'm getting at is that maybe if we hand it over, they'll tell us
1593660	1594660	what it is.
1594660	1595980	I like that idea.
1595980	1598740	We haven't really gotten any help from anybody else yet.
1598740	1600380	Yeah, they seem like they know.
1600380	1602460	Also maybe they'll leave us alone if.
1602460	1604500	Or just take this off our plates.
1604500	1605820	Like maybe they're right.
1605820	1606900	Maybe this is above our pay grade.
1606900	1610300	And then we can move to the city and ban silk cocaine.
1610300	1611300	That's a dumb idea.
1611300	1612300	Nobody would do that.
1612300	1617740	I mean, that's, yeah, that's kind of what I'm getting at is, I mean, if they are a helpful
1617740	1620620	source and maybe, yeah, that they solve some shit for us.
1620620	1621620	Yeah.
1621620	1622620	Well, I mean, let's do it.
1622620	1624340	We've made awful decisions up to this point.
1624340	1625340	So.
1625340	1626340	Oh, I have made awful decisions.
1626340	1627340	Keith, you're right.
1627340	1632260	We've all made pretty awful choices and yeah, if we can like present this as a token of
1632260	1635780	our good will to these people, throw them a bone.
1635780	1638300	Maybe they take this whole fucking mess off our shoulders.
1638300	1639300	I like it.
1639300	1643500	Well, I'll put it in the trunk tomorrow when they're here, I'll, I'll come in and be like,
1643500	1645740	Hey, did, do you know who's this is?
1645740	1647460	Somebody left it or how should I present it?
1647460	1648860	You could say you found it at John's house.
1648860	1649860	Yeah.
1649860	1650860	Okay.
1650860	1651860	Oh yeah.
1651860	1652860	I found this at John's house.
1652860	1653860	I just, it's just been in my cruiser.
1653860	1656580	It's been in the back of my trunk for a couple of days.
1656580	1659340	So I'm going to head off to Maggie's house.
1659340	1660340	Sounds good.
1660340	1664020	And the other two of you are going and taking the stuff to your respective homes.
1664460	1664960	All right.
1664960	1667460	If I could have the two of you leave this room now.
1676140	1679900	Keith Vigna, you pull up to the chief's house.
1679900	1683380	I'm trying to think of when I had you lose another, go ahead and lose another willpower
1683380	1684380	point for me.
1684380	1685380	Okay.
1685380	1686380	So you're at six.
1686380	1687380	Yeah.
1687380	1688380	You pull up.
1688380	1691220	It is a nice old brick house in the style of ranch.
1691220	1692400	There's one door in the front.
1692400	1696640	There's like a big window in front of the patio that is out front.
1696640	1697720	It's one story.
1697720	1698720	Pretty nice place.
1698720	1704460	But the chief's cruiser is actually parked in the driveway, which as you know, it hasn't
1704460	1707640	been since she left on the night of December 1st.
1707640	1708960	You also see Drew's car there.
1708960	1709960	Oh yeah.
1709960	1710960	I was going to ask, what does Drew drive?
1710960	1711960	Just a car?
1711960	1712960	Yeah.
1712960	1713960	What does Drew drive?
1713960	1717720	Since he works all the time, he probably has quite a bit of money, so probably a mini Cooper.
1717720	1718720	Yes.
1718720	1719720	Yes.
1719720	1720880	That is precisely correct.
1720880	1726680	He drives a very clean mini Cooper and it is red with a black stripe.
1726680	1727680	Yep.
1727680	1728680	Dope.
1728680	1729680	So that is out front as well.
1729680	1730680	What would you like to do?
1730680	1731680	I don't want to pull into the driveway.
1731680	1736960	I want to pull like off to the side of the road in front of the house and go up and knock
1736960	1737960	on the door.
1737960	1741880	As you knock on the door, the door swings open.
1741880	1744520	It wasn't closed completely.
1744520	1748100	And as it opens, it stops short.
1748100	1752600	Like it can't open fully with you just pushing at it.
1752600	1759680	You kind of look around the corner and you see there are two unconscious men on the ground.
1759680	1760680	Are the lights on?
1760680	1767020	The lights are not on, but these two unconscious men, one of them is Drew Andrews and it smells
1767020	1768220	like poop.
1768220	1770120	If I flip the switch, do the lights come on?
1770120	1771120	Yes.
1771120	1775280	When you do flip the switch, you see that in the living room, which is just adjacent
1775280	1781040	to the foyer, Chief Maggie Cook's body in full uniform leans slumped against the wall
1781040	1782520	on the other side of the room.
1782520	1786240	A large chef's knife rests in her left hand.
1786240	1791760	Her face has been stabbed repeatedly and her left foot is missing.
1791760	1794840	Blood was clearly flowing rapidly from there.
1794840	1799360	And as you push your way further into the room, it smells like gasoline and natural
1799360	1800360	gas in here.
1800400	1803240	Go ahead and roll sanity for me.
1803240	1805040	Forty on a forty.
1805040	1806800	Ooh, congratulations.
1806800	1807800	Sweet.
1807800	1811600	You only lose one upon seeing this because of your success?
1811600	1812600	What do you want to do?
1812600	1816600	If I look at that other body, is it Maggie Cook's dad or can I identify the other male
1816600	1817600	body?
1817600	1824900	The other male body is an odd looking little man with round glasses on a fat face with
1824900	1826760	no hair and no chin.
1826760	1828040	Is he alive or dead?
1828040	1829040	They're both alive.
1829040	1830040	Okay.
1830040	1831200	Two pockets for an ID.
1831200	1838320	Yeah, you rifle through his pants and you find a wallet with an ID for a Harold Dorsey.
1838320	1842160	Okay, I immediately go to the kitchen and shut the burners off.
1842160	1848080	As you walk into the kitchen, you see an unkempt man at the table hunched over with a fork
1848080	1851240	in one hand and a pistol in the other.
1851240	1856820	A bullet hole in his head has left him face down in a plate of meat.
1856820	1859600	His left foot is also missing.
1859600	1864160	It smells like natural gas, like crazy in here, as well as gasoline, which makes sense
1864160	1869080	because there are gas cans sitting all over the place and gas has clearly been poured
1869080	1870620	on everything.
1870620	1876080	The range has a skillet on it with the leftovers of two feet that have had the meat pulled
1876080	1877560	from them.
1877560	1882300	All four burners are turned all the way up and as you go to turn the burners off, I need
1882300	1884840	you to roll sanity for what you just saw.
1884840	1887060	87 on a 39.
1887060	1892940	So go ahead and roll a, we're gonna do a D6 plus two.
1892940	1894580	That's four plus two is six.
1894580	1899540	Nice, so you lose six sanity, which puts you down at 33.
1899540	1901500	Puts you down at 33.
1901500	1905500	The breaking point of 30, correct, rapidly approaching.
1905500	1908740	And as you do that- Do I successfully turn the burners off?
1908740	1914380	So you're trying, but because of what you just saw, maybe you have a different reaction?
1914380	1918060	So in the course of walking in here, I've lost seven sanity.
1918060	1919060	Is that right?
1919060	1920060	Yep.
1920060	1921060	So you're losing your fucking mind.
1921060	1922060	Yeah.
1922060	1925660	I'm going to say like, I probably am going to throw up and then I'm, what do you think?
1925660	1931540	You throw up all over the kitchen floor and as you do, you fall to your hands and knees
1931540	1938200	and your left hand, your left hand hits a wire and you know immediately what you've
1938200	1944140	done because you hear a click off to the side of the room at the front door, the entrance.
1944140	1951580	You see a trap has clearly been set and you just fell right into it.
1951580	1957980	A fire starts right at the front door and there's clearly a gasoline lead path that
1957980	1964180	is leading, going to lead the fire back to this back room filled with natural gas.
1964180	1965180	What do you do?
1965180	1966180	I'm on my hands and knees.
1966180	1967180	Yep.
1967180	1968500	I look up, I'm looking at the stove.
1968500	1969500	Yep.
1969500	1971060	There's a fire extinguisher there, right?
1971060	1972060	Yeah.
1972060	1978000	And then I grab it, stand up and start fire extinguishing at the flames while I'm running
1978000	1979000	out the door.
1979000	1980000	Okay.
1980000	1984660	So the flames are leading from the door into the kitchen with all the gas and stuff.
1984660	1988580	I'm going to take the fire extinguisher, run out of the kitchen, aim it at the closest
1988580	1995900	part of the fire to me and try to do that all along and then get out of there cause
1995900	1998140	I don't want to fucking blow up.
1998140	1999140	Yeah.
1999140	2000140	That sounds good.
2000220	2001940	So you're interested in role firefighting for me.
2001940	2002940	I'm just kidding.
2002940	2005860	Uh, do you have a skill that would help you in this endeavor?
2005860	2010140	Do you think I've got a 60 decks, 50 athletics.
2010140	2012900	Let's do an average of your dexterity and intelligence.
2012900	2014860	Quick little average of those 55.
2014860	2015860	Yeah.
2015860	2017740	So roll against that 55 71.
2017740	2018740	Okay.
2018740	2019740	Awesome.
2019740	2024020	And he's a different, I grabbed some new dice.
2024020	2025020	Try Joe's.
2025020	2026420	His seemed to be working really well.
2026420	2027900	Well, I already rolled that.
2027900	2029560	Yeah, no, you fucked that up.
2029560	2036960	So you grab the fire extinguisher and slip on your own vomit as you, as you get up and
2036960	2042720	are trying to wildly spray this, this fire extinguisher at the fire and then get out
2042720	2043720	of there.
2043720	2049880	So as you are running out, you have to jump over the two unconscious men.
2049880	2055120	So as you are jumping over them to leave this house that is going to explode, what do you
2055120	2056120	do?
2056120	2058160	I grabbed Drew and try to pull him out with me.
2058160	2060680	Full strength for me.
2060680	2062680	That's a 34 on a 55.
2062680	2064240	That is a success.
2064240	2065240	Yay.
2065240	2066240	Finally.
2066240	2069800	Uh, do you want to narrate it?
2069800	2071320	I slip on my vomit.
2071320	2074320	So now I'm covered in my vomit and probably some blood from that guy's foot.
2074320	2079560	I get up, I'm spraying the fire extinguisher all over in that room and on the trail of
2079560	2080560	gasoline.
2080560	2084480	I jump over and I'm spraying the fire and I realized who I just jumped over.
2084480	2088400	I look at both the unconscious guys on the ground, realize I don't know who that other
2088400	2093400	guy is, but I know that this is Drew and as much shit as we give Drew, we need him.
2093400	2099160	And I put my arms underneath his armpits and just pull as hard as I can until I get out
2099160	2104580	of the front door and I trip back over myself off the front porch and kind of fling Drew
2104580	2106160	and fall on my back.
2106200	2114800	As the house turns into dust, just fucking explodes, bad boys 2 mansion style.
2114800	2121240	You guys go flying into the yard and smoke immediately starts billowing and you can hear
2121240	2128240	the ringing of your ears underscored by the wood that was once the chief's house.
2128240	2132280	As I look at that, after the explosion it kind of knocked me back and knocked me out
2132280	2135040	and I've just, I'm out for a little while.
2135040	2136040	Yeah, probably, yeah.
2136040	2139600	I want to like come to in, you know, half an hour.
2139600	2140600	Okay.
2140600	2143440	Sounds good for the sake of the story.
2143440	2153040	As Keith closes his eyes, laying back on the front lawn, you're suddenly standing in your
2153040	2154660	childhood home.
2154660	2159160	It's your birthday and your friends are standing around this table waiting for you to blow
2159160	2161220	out the candles on your cake.
2161220	2165620	You look up and you see your parents in the corner talking to your little brother.
2165620	2170860	You squeeze your eyes tightly as you blow out your candles and as you do, you see that
2170860	2174300	black shiny viscous sludge.
2174300	2177080	Inside this muck are two thrashing bodies.
2177080	2181660	Their hands reach out trying to escape this thing that has trapped them, but the struggle
2181660	2183860	does not last long.
2183860	2189780	Their limbs seem to fold into this ooze, becoming one with the sentient mass of goop that is
2189780	2193600	now sliding across the ground toward you, opening your eyes.
2193600	2198740	You see all of your peers around your childhood kitchen table laughing at you.
2198740	2200660	The candles are still lit.
2200660	2206140	You look up and your parents are poorly attempting to hold back laughter.
2206140	2208940	You look at the cake and it is gone.
2208940	2213860	You have a plate that is clean and you look around and see everyone else is eating a piece
2213860	2214860	of cake.
2214860	2219180	They are all laughing and begin to chant while pointing at you.
2219180	2223900	Beans, beans, Keith, beans, his only friends are figurines.
2223900	2231440	Beans, beans, Keith, beans, we'll blow your friends to smithereens.
2231440	2234460	And maybe I'll edit that so that there's multiple voices.
2234460	2235460	Yeah, you should.
2235460	2239640	Your parents look at you disgusted and turn and walk out of the room.
2239640	2244740	You run to follow them, but looking ahead, you only see that woman dressed in old-timey
2244740	2246420	clothing.
2246420	2250740	Sitting down, you fall into a black hole in the ground and you're standing in a cold,
2250740	2252300	dark room.
2252300	2258840	The lights begin to flicker on and you see massive tanks the size of grain silos standing
2258840	2262260	right before you is yourself.
2262260	2264140	You walk up to you.
2264140	2270760	The face of the other you begins to age rapidly and then just as rapidly ages in reverse.
2270760	2275640	You walk up to one of the massive tanks in this massive, dank, dimly lit room.
2275640	2282320	You press your face against it to see its contents and something creeps toward you.
2282320	2290120	And as it is about to come into focus, you wake up to the sound of sirens, their firefighters
2290120	2305240	running all around and it is a scene in the front yard of Chief Maggie Cook's home.
2305240	2306440	Did you pass a roll with those dice?
2306440	2310980	I passed a roll with those dice and all my other ones were with those and I did not pass
2310980	2311980	the rolls with those.
2311980	2314720	So I decided that these are going to be the ones I use for now.
2314720	2323380	Okay, so Clark and John, you are a fair amount into unloading the stuff into your homes.
2323380	2326420	I need you to both lose a willpower point for me.
2326420	2328800	God damn it, Luke.
2328800	2336080	As you are just about finished unloading, you still not finished either one of you,
2336080	2345780	you both receive word that the Chief's home has exploded and is on fire.
2345780	2349920	Your presence has been requested at the location.
2349920	2352480	Clark is just too sleepy and he goes to bed.
2352480	2355600	I'm kidding, I go.
2355600	2364520	Well, that was good, that was like, John was just going to ignore it.
2364520	2366520	John is going to...
2366520	2369400	You are welcome to do whatever you would like to do.
2369400	2373640	He's going to take a little pinky of that nose candy.
2373640	2374640	Get a little boost.
2374640	2377640	And then go to sleep.
2377640	2378640	And then go out.
2378640	2380320	Gotta tuck the baby in.
2380320	2382280	So I understand that improves my willpower?
2382280	2384720	Yes, you get a plus one to willpower.
2384720	2387380	That worth it.
2387380	2389600	You took a baby, you took a baby rip.
2389600	2391360	Okay, he takes a bigger one.
2391360	2393600	Okay, you get two willpower points back.
2393600	2394880	On top of the one I already had?
2394880	2395880	No.
2395880	2397880	Okay, then he does another one.
2397880	2400480	Okay, you've got three willpower points back.
2400480	2403680	All right, I'm feeling good.
2403680	2405800	You're at 11 out of 12 willpower.
2405800	2407480	I feel almost perfect.
2407480	2408800	You are riding high.
2408800	2413040	Does anybody just want to get on the radio and just chat, just talk?
2413040	2414040	Just rap.
2414040	2418400	Just rap.
2418400	2428240	As you arrive at the scene of the situation, the home of Chief Maggie Cook is mostly embers
2428240	2436140	and there are multiple fire trucks and ambulances out in front of the home.
2436140	2443800	The chief's cruiser is parked in the driveway of the home, as is Drew Andrews' red with
2443800	2451920	a black stripe Mini Cooper is in front of the home, as is Keith's cruiser.
2451920	2456300	When you walk up to the scene, you see Keith is sitting in the back of one of the ambulances
2456300	2468160	with a blanket around him and Drew is in a different ambulance in the back of it with
2468160	2469960	a blanket wrapped around him.
2469960	2471520	He's got a little cup of hot cocoa.
2471520	2472800	Guys, what's going on?
2472800	2473800	What happened here?
2473800	2477680	Yeah, I go walk on up to Keith.
2477680	2481680	Their feet were missing.
2481680	2488640	Their feet and the burners, they ate the feet.
2488640	2492000	They ate their feet and Maggie.
2492000	2494720	Did you see Maggie?
2494720	2499740	They stabbed her and cut her foot off.
2499740	2503340	They stabbed her in the face and cut her foot off and they ate it.
2503340	2504340	Who did that, Keith?
2504340	2505340	I don't know.
2505340	2506340	Is she alive?
2506340	2507340	No.
2507340	2508340	Her and the other two died.
2508340	2511260	Who are the other two?
2511260	2515340	The guy with the fork and the guy I have.
2515340	2517420	I slap Keith a couple times.
2517420	2521820	I pull an ID out of my pocket and I hand it to John.
2521820	2525440	That was the unconscious guy and then I don't know who the other two.
2525440	2528280	The ID is for a Harold Dorsey.
2528280	2534600	He's an odd looking little man with round glasses on a fat face with no hair and no
2534600	2535600	chin.
2535600	2539860	Hey, can we reload a quick save and instead of doing any of that sting shit, go check
2539860	2542880	on the chief's house?
2542880	2545960	Say about like 1 a.m.
2545960	2547280	Go talk to Drew.
2547280	2549000	I need to sit, lay down.
2549000	2550000	Okay.
2550000	2553000	I go walk on over to Drew.
2553000	2554000	Hey, Drew.
2554000	2555000	Hey, Clark.
2555000	2558000	Can you tell me what happened here tonight?
2558000	2561960	Um, chief is dead.
2561960	2564240	Chief is, chief is dead.
2564240	2567320	Keith saved my life.
2567320	2571760	And he just breaks down and starts crying in a pretty funny whimper.
2571760	2575760	I put a hand on his shoulder.
2575760	2577120	All right, Drew.
2577120	2578120	All right.
2578120	2579120	That's okay.
2579120	2582200	Sounds like you had a rough night.
2582200	2584760	Can you tell me how Maggie died?
2584760	2586400	Her face was stabbed.
2587120	2595040	There was blood all over her face and her foot was gone and I just threw up and passed
2595040	2597480	out immediately.
2597480	2600600	I couldn't do anything to stop that.
2600600	2602680	Drew, it's not your fault, man.
2602680	2605680	How'd you know to come out here?
2605680	2615640	Harold Dorsey came and said that he needed to go see her, that she said to be there.
2616040	2620360	So I wanted to go with him because you told me to look for her.
2620360	2622880	Hey man, you did a great job.
2622880	2625640	I found her, but she's dead.
2625640	2626640	Sure.
2626640	2628040	Sometimes that happens in life.
2628040	2630840	The thing you're looking for is just dead when you find it.
2630840	2632320	Who's Harold Dorsey?
2632320	2633320	Is he okay?
2633320	2637200	Did he make it out?
2637200	2641440	You know, I haven't, I'm going to go check on him for you real quick, but, but who, can
2641440	2642920	you tell us who he is first of all?
2642920	2643920	How do you know him?
2643920	2647600	He works for the newspaper in the city.
2647600	2648600	He's a reporter?
2648600	2651600	He's a reporter.
2651600	2665720	I know you're real emotional, but you're sounding more bratty than sad.
2665720	2672640	She came to the department and he said that I was supposed to let him borrow the keys
2672640	2676280	to her house, but I didn't think that was very safe.
2676280	2682800	And I didn't want him to see the Jacob's cat man thing.
2682800	2684800	So I just went with him.
2684800	2687360	Did he see any of the stuff we took out of that storage locker?
2687360	2688360	No.
2688360	2689360	Storage lockers?
2689360	2690360	No.
2690360	2691360	Okay.
2691360	2692360	Did you see who stabbed her in the face?
2692360	2698480	No, she was dead when we got there and we both just, neither one of us could take it.
2698480	2705000	We both passed out and what, what room of the house was she in?
2705000	2707520	She was in the living room that was right there in the front.
2707520	2713160	We, we must've gone unconscious as soon as we saw the blood and it smelled like gas.
2713160	2714920	I can't believe we didn't die.
2714920	2715920	Yeah.
2715920	2716920	How did you get out of there?
2716920	2717920	You said Keith saved you.
2717920	2718920	What, what happened?
2718920	2721000	They said Keith pulled when they got here.
2721000	2723560	I was on top of Keith in the front yard.
2723560	2727440	I think he pulled me out as the house exploded.
2727440	2729680	Was the house on fire when you got here?
2729680	2732320	No, but it smelled like gas.
2732320	2735040	Someone started the fire with you two inside.
2735040	2736040	Yeah.
2736040	2739800	Did you see any other vehicles or tracks on your way up here?
2739800	2740800	No.
2740800	2741800	Okay.
2741800	2745720	At this point I, I'm kind of coming to and I look over and I see that Drew has some hot
2745720	2746720	cocoa.
2746720	2748960	So I look at my EMT guys.
2748960	2751640	I'm like, Hey guys, can I have some hot cocoa please?
2751640	2752640	Oh yeah, sir.
2752640	2754400	I can get you some hot cocoa.
2754400	2755400	Thanks.
2756400	2760200	And then he unzips his pants.
2760200	2762640	That's a, it's like a soft server.
2762640	2769000	I thought you were a surfer from your voice, but oh, it all stays in now.
2769000	2770000	Okay.
2770000	2774960	I don't know about dicks.
2774960	2781400	I don't know what porn I look at based on the dick and the porn.
2781400	2782400	I don't.
2782400	2784920	I categorize it by the drapes.
2785440	2790440	No drapes or drapes.
2790440	2791440	Okay.
2791440	2792440	What kind of porn do you have?
2792440	2794440	Oh, I've got no drape porn and drape porn.
2814920	2816920	I do.
2816920	2826920	How can you have enough drowning out all the notes?
2828920	2832920	Cause nobody knows.
2832920	2840920	Nobody knows.
2840920	2843920	Yeah.
