0	5200	Hello, one. Hello, all. Hello, y'all.
5200	9600	It's your best friend with a trash-eating problem, Wolf the Dog.
9600	14600	We are hitting you live from 694.2 PTBP.
14600	20600	It is December the 6th, and the time is noon o'clock, my babies.
20600	25900	Mmm, sounds like it's about garbage bin o'clock for y'all, Wolfy boy.
26000	30800	Speaking of trash, earlier I took my dog, Wolf the Dog,
30800	34300	to go find him something to fill his little belly up with.
34300	40900	But upon venturing outside the sky, I suddenly darkened all around us for a little bit.
40900	43100	Y'all ever seen an eclipse?
43100	46600	It was like that, but a little different.
46600	51400	It was real spooky, y'all. Wolf nearly shit his little old britches.
51400	55500	Which wolf did that? I'll let y'all figure that one out.
55500	61600	When I came back down to the studio, I found a note attached with a thumbtack to the inside of my door.
61600	65100	It is emblazoned with a solid green triangle and says,
65100	70100	For a wolf at the top, I guess it's this week's Howlin' with Wolf.
70100	74200	It comes from user Chucklin' Boy over on the subreddit.
74200	79100	He's an Android user, but logged into iTunes on his computer to leave a review.
79100	82500	This boy sure knows how to make ol' Wolfy blush.
82500	84400	Chucklin' Boy writes,
98000	99700	Something fitting, isn't that?
99700	103300	And remember, the mission is over when the world ends.
103300	106800	For all of you out there listening, be sure to stop by the subreddit.
106800	110800	We are starting to see more discussion around the Greater Delta Green Cannon,
110800	114400	as well as game running tips and general show stuff.
114400	116100	See y'all there!
116100	118500	Wolf bless you, Chucklin' Boy.
118500	121900	You are my fire, my one desire.
121900	126800	Believe when I say, if you want to write a message for Wolf to read on air,
126800	131000	tag us on Instagram or Twitter, at PretendingPod,
131000	138000	or write a five-star review on Apple Podcasts and email us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.
138000	141900	Fuck Mark Zuckerberg, it's time for the news.
141900	149200	A tall, gaunt, humanoid figure with translucent skin and comically long arms asked Clark for the book.
149200	151900	Keith shot it until it dissipated.
151900	157400	A couple of city cops showed up to check on the shots fired at the city cemetery.
157400	164500	John mentioned Marvin Glass and the city cops apologized and left to mind their own damn business.
164500	170000	These heroes of ours then went to lay their fallen former co-workers to rest.
170000	177600	Inside the tomb was a cloaked figure, an older Clark Bishop chanting from a piece of ancient parchment.
177600	185000	The words on the paper turned to little sparks that danced around, bathing the boys in a warm light.
185000	190000	Clark charged at himself, only to grab two fistfuls of cloak and bonk his head
190000	197000	smack into the wall of Ari Manstein's mausoleum, where an older version of himself just stood.
197000	202500	Y'all, none of that made a damn lick of sense to me, but that doesn't mean I'm not hungry.
202500	208500	Filling me up always is kudzu with no backbone.
220000	231000	I could come close, but I'd probably forget Kansas, Illinois, Arkansas, Oklahoma, uh, uh,
231000	236000	Iowa, Tennessee, Kentucky, Kentucky.
236000	239500	One more Nebraska corner hit us up toward the top.
239500	242000	Nebraska. Nice. Nice. Got it.
242000	249500	I didn't know we hit the corner in Nebraska. I'm pretty proud of myself because I am traditionally terrible at geography.
249500	253500	Hey, can you describe to me in great detail the state seal?
253500	255000	It's two bears.
255000	257000	Describe, yeah, I'm just kidding.
257000	258500	Two bears.
258500	260500	Two bears. Okay.
260500	261500	It's just two bears.
261500	265500	I'm gonna hit this vape one more time and then, uh, I'll hit my vape.
265500	268500	Well, cause yours has too much, but mine kind of dissipates real quick.
268500	270500	Get out.
270500	272000	If I can find it in my pocket.
272000	273500	Get out.
273500	274500	I'm not gonna do it.
274500	275000	Get out.
275000	276500	I'm sitting down.
276500	278500	I'm making brown.
278500	280500	Just fight your nicotine habit.
280500	282500	I can't do it. I refuse to do it.
282500	285500	What if I stabbed you with a mechanical pencil every time you hit your jewel?
285500	287500	I would hire Phillip Morris to pursue you.
287500	291500	What if you lost a sanity point every time you hit your jewel?
291500	293500	That's dope.
293500	295500	Okay, I'm good.
295500	299500	Next campaign. The no vape campaign.
299500	303500	I rolled an 87. I got that out of the way.
303500	308500	Alright, Luke hit his jewel 365 times between the last sessions.
308500	310500	He is insane.
310500	311500	Certifiable.
311500	313500	He's come back around.
313500	317500	He's got four new characters to show off and go crazy.
317500	319500	And go crazy and immediately die from.
319500	321500	Okay, let's see.
321500	325500	Dude, I was, okay, so I made a resolve not to drink as much last night
325500	331500	cause I was listening to this episode and we were dumb.
331500	332500	This last one?
332500	333500	Kinda.
333500	340500	The man in black is like, you're here with the book.
340500	343500	And then we instantly start talking about a second you.
343500	346500	And then we don't put it together.
346500	348500	I was like, god damn it.
348500	349500	Anyway.
349500	350500	Hindsight.
350500	353500	But I also forgot everything that happened in that episode.
353500	355500	Good to listen back to.
355500	357500	Good to be embarrassed by yourself.
357500	358500	It's important.
359500	364500	Did you see his list of pros and cons?
364500	366500	Oh yes, incredible.
366500	368500	Pros, the keeper's voices.
368500	370500	Cons, the keeper's voices.
370500	372500	Wait, what was that poster?
372500	373500	I like that a lot.
373500	375500	He just posted on our RPG.
375500	381500	That one made me a chuckling boy.
381500	383500	Welcome to the chuckle hut.
383500	384500	Are you guys ready?
384500	385500	Yeah, I'm ready.
385500	387500	We'll find out.
387500	389500	The three of you wake up.
389500	391500	You just feel this immense pain.
391500	395500	It's almost like a shock has just covered your entire body.
395500	397500	Your stomach hurts.
397500	399500	You just feel it all up in your throat.
399500	402500	Your ears are ringing and pulsating.
402500	404500	It's dark.
404500	406500	It's cold here.
406500	407500	It smells.
407500	409500	What is that smell?
409500	411500	It's like savory?
411500	415500	There's a sweetness to it and your eyes begin to adjust.
415500	417500	There's a pool of blood on the floor.
417500	420500	The corpse of Ari Manstein is kind of in it.
420500	423500	Her coffin is flipped over on the cold dirt.
423500	425500	You look at each other.
425500	428500	Blood splatter has speckled each of you.
428500	432500	John, Kevin, Lee Pettymore all in black tactical gear.
432500	437500	Keith Vigna in his brightly colored polo and boat shoes.
437500	444500	Clark Bishop in an old contention PD uniform currently holding a thick black cloak.
444500	446500	The shock begins to wear off.
446500	456500	You feel a searing pain on your chest, on your back, on the bottom of your left foot and inside your dominant palm.
456500	458500	Is everybody left handed?
458500	460500	What was wounded again?
460500	462500	Our chest, our back?
462500	464500	Pussy and our crack?
464500	466500	Yes, all four.
466500	470500	It is the chest, the back, the left foot and inside your dominant palm.
470500	474500	I would assume you're all right handed unless you've specified otherwise.
474500	477500	John Lee Pettymore kind of seems like he would be left handed.
477500	480500	Did it change when you went into Kevin?
480500	482500	You're ambidextrous I think.
482500	488500	It's the brain not the body so your brain wouldn't switch handedness I don't think.
488500	493500	So Kevin was left handed so now you've got a really weak right hand.
493500	496500	Right, he hasn't built up the fucking muscles.
496500	498500	Damn dude, I know how to solve that.
498500	503500	It's a lot easier to be right handed like everyone in the world.
503500	507500	Literally every person except for liars.
507500	512500	If you had trouble learning to write growing up it's because you're a liar.
512500	519500	My mom is left handed like a liar and she always put the pencil in my left hand when I was growing up.
519500	521500	To try to make you left handed?
521500	522500	Be like me son.
522500	528500	My dad's left handed and he went to Catholic school and part of their thing was trying to make kids right handed who were left handed.
528500	533500	He also broke his arm when he was a really young kid and he still remained left handed.
533500	536500	He said that is how strongly it took to him.
536500	539500	The Catholics, they can instill some stuff.
539500	541500	But not handedness apparently.
541500	542500	No.
542500	543500	Okay sorry.
543500	545500	Chest, back, left foot, dominant hand?
545500	546500	Yes sir.
546500	547500	You said the palm.
547500	548500	Yes inside the palm.
548500	549500	Can I look at my palm?
549500	554500	When you look in your palm there are letters burned into your hand.
554500	559500	It says T-I-L-D-E.
559500	561500	Tilde.
561500	564500	That's in Keith's hand?
564500	566500	That's in all three of your hands.
566500	568500	Okay. Do you boys have Tilde written in your hands?
568500	569500	I do.
569500	571500	Does it look burned in? Is that what you said?
571500	572500	Burned.
572500	573500	Yeah.
573500	578500	I think I would want to check what our backs say but I mean I'm looking at my hand and
578500	581500	then I'm looking in front of me and do I still see old Clark?
581500	582500	He's holding the robe.
582500	584500	I shake out the robe.
584500	585500	Nice.
585500	588500	Does anything come out?
588500	589500	His depends.
589500	590500	Yeah.
590500	594500	God.
594500	601500	He's a great sorcerer but he's fully incontinent.
601500	603500	Smells like real estate agent.
603500	605500	That we made shit his pants.
605500	606500	Okay so yeah.
606500	608500	This takes me back.
608500	609500	Yeah.
609500	611500	Boys my back is burning.
611500	612500	Is there something written?
612500	613500	Mine too.
613500	614500	My foot.
614500	615500	Here.
615500	618500	I'll check your back while I take my shoe off and you check my foot.
618500	620500	And we play Twister.
620500	623500	Keith struggles to rip his way too tight polo off.
623500	630500	It hurts really badly as you pull off your way too tight polo as the polos texture moves
630500	634500	across the burned skin on your chest and on your back.
634500	635500	Ow.
635500	646500	And you all see that on each of your chests burned in are the letters M-A-R-V-I-N.
646500	652500	On your back it says D-R-E-W.
652500	662500	And on the bottom of each of your left feet it says M-A-G-G-I-E.
662500	668500	Clark the bottom of your left foot when you look at it, it also has this very distinct
668500	671500	lack of skin, a discoloration.
671500	672500	What do you mean?
672500	673500	Like it's translucent?
673500	675500	No like this skin has been eaten away.
675500	676500	Okay.
676500	677500	Is it black?
677500	678500	Yeah.
678500	679500	And what's it in the shape of?
679500	683500	A circle with six smaller circles.
683500	684500	Okay.
684500	685500	Surrounding it.
685500	686500	That's only on Clark's foot?
686500	687500	Yes it is.
687500	688500	Gotcha.
688500	690500	Do these burns look like the behold a fool brand?
690500	691500	They do not.
691500	692500	Okay.
692500	693500	These look much cleaner.
693500	694500	Okay.
694500	701500	I need everyone to roll a sanity check for me.
701500	704500	23 but I still failed.
704500	706500	Oh shit.
706500	709500	I crit fail with an 88.
709500	710500	Wonderful.
710500	711500	Thomas?
711500	712500	84.
712500	713500	All three of you lose one sanity.
713500	714500	Let's see where that puts you each.
714500	715500	That puts me at 19.
715500	718500	That puts me at 18 which is also my breaking point.
718500	719500	I'm at 11.
719500	720500	My breaking point is 8.
720500	721500	All right.
721500	728500	So what we have here is a new breaking point for Clark Bishop, a new breaking point that
728500	733660	is going into effect now for John Lee Pettymore that he broke into on the last episode or
733660	735900	two episodes ago.
735900	740740	And then fittingly John Lee Pettymore as well as Clark Bishop both rolled over their power
740740	743020	so we'll see what that does moving forward.
743020	749340	What we're going to do for this third and final breaking point for each of you, you're
749340	755060	going to roll a D100 on the Call of Cthulhu 7th edition manias table.
755060	758120	We're going to roll it three times and then choose.
758120	760920	You can choose which mania you want to take.
760920	761920	Okay.
761920	767960	Thomas, go ahead and roll up some numbers for me.
767960	773760	61, 62, and 51.
773760	774760	All right.
774760	780120	61, Kleptomania, the irrational compulsion for stealing.
780120	789960	62, oh boy, Ligeromania, L-I-G-Y-R-O, mania, uncontrollable compulsion to make loud or
789960	791200	shrill noises.
791200	792200	I really don't.
792200	794200	Please don't do that one.
794200	795960	I really suggest.
795960	798000	That one's called The Listener's Delight.
798000	801320	I really suggest you don't choose that one.
801320	806460	He somehow went down to zero Patreon subscribers.
806460	811380	Another podcast was chugging along just fine and then all of a sudden it tanked.
811380	816340	That asshole Thomas tried to go all Michael Winslow.
816340	818580	And did you roll 51 or 52?
818580	819580	51.
819580	827780	51 is Gymnomania, G-Y-M-N-O mania, which is a compulsion with nudity.
827780	828780	A compulsion with nudity?
828780	830100	Like it has to be nude?
830100	831100	It says with nudity.
831100	832100	With nudity.
832100	833100	Yeah.
833100	835140	I'm going to just take the stealing one.
835140	836140	Yeah.
836820	838820	That's like the most useful in an RPG.
838820	839820	That absolutely makes sense.
839820	843820	John Lee Pettymore, John Kevin Lee Pettymore, now a kleptomaniac.
843820	847820	Joe, do you want to roll three times for me on this table here?
847820	848820	Sure.
848820	849820	Let's see what you got.
849820	850820	A 30.
850820	851820	Okay.
851820	852820	A 94.
852820	853820	Okay.
853820	854820	A 92.
854820	861820	I'm not using these dice for the rest of the night.
862500	867500	Or you get hot it all out.
867500	874500	A 30 is Colromania, C-O-U-L-R-O mania, it's an obsession with clowns.
874500	875500	Okay.
875500	876500	Interesting.
876500	878500	A 92, you said?
878500	879500	No, what was it?
879500	880500	94?
880500	881500	Uh-huh.
881500	887020	94, Theomania, belief that he or she is a god.
888020	892020	Might actually make some sense here.
892020	893020	Interesting.
893020	895020	And what was the third number?
895020	896020	94?
896020	899020	The 94 was the belief in god.
899020	900020	Belief in god.
900020	901020	Oh, 30.
901020	902020	Nope.
902020	903020	We did that one already.
903020	904020	Okay, the 92.
904020	908020	92, Technomania, an obsession with new technology.
908020	910020	I think I got to take the god one.
910020	911020	I think so.
911020	913020	That's the dopest one.
913020	915020	That seems obvious.
915020	916020	Read the phrasing on it one more time.
917020	919020	Belief that he is a god.
919020	920020	That's what I thought.
920020	922020	Yep, pretty straightforward.
922020	930020	Those are going to dictate your actions, dictate not so much, but help push you with new objectives
930020	931020	and persuasions.
931020	933020	Oh, shit.
933020	942020	The three of you are in this still black crypt, pure darkness, and there is the corpse of
942020	947020	Ari Manstein, there is the coffin flipped over, and then you know that outside of this
947020	952020	tomb are still the three android men, their corpses are out there.
952020	953020	What would you like to do?
953020	957020	Clark rushes Kevin and I'm trying to tackle Kevin.
957020	958020	Alright.
958020	962020	If the two of you could roll unarmed combat against each other to see who gets the upper
962020	963020	hand.
963020	967020	Can I roll firearms to see if I can shoot him first?
967020	968020	Yeah.
968020	971020	Is he rolling against my unarmed for that?
971020	976020	I got a 41 on a 70.
976020	981020	I got a 56 on a 60.
981020	984020	Alrighty, Thomas rolled a d10 for damage.
984020	985020	Six.
985020	992020	As Clark Bishop starts getting up, cloak in hand, he runs toward John Lee Pettymore.
992020	994020	I'm screaming as I'm running toward him.
994020	998020	I mean, I'm just guttural yelling as I charge you.
998020	1002020	Can I hear what that's like to put me in?
1002020	1008020	Okay, that spooks me, so I draw my pistol and fire and shoot him in the thigh.
1008020	1011020	God damn it, Kevin, you told me about that.
1011020	1012020	It was old me.
1012020	1013020	I saw old me.
1013020	1014020	Who are you?
1014020	1015020	Why couldn't you warn me about that?
1015020	1016020	Who are you?
1016020	1018020	Why are you trying to attack me?
1018020	1020020	God damn it.
1020020	1024020	And I start to feel the blood pooling from the side of my hip.
1024020	1029020	I see shots fired and it's this dimly lit place, but I see the big loud flashing of
1029020	1030020	the muzzle of the gun.
1030020	1033020	All three of you can't hear anything anymore.
1033020	1035020	Your ears are ringing.
1035020	1038020	Tinnitus is on the verge of happening.
1038020	1045020	I rush over to Clark and try to apply first aid to his.
1045020	1048020	Roll first aid for me.
1048020	1050020	That's a 37 on a 60.
1050020	1053020	Roll a d4 and tell me what you're doing.
1053020	1056020	Applying pressure with a one.
1056020	1057020	A one.
1057020	1062020	You apply a one hit point amount of pressure to the wound, stopping the bleeding.
1062020	1063020	Cool.
1063020	1064020	That's what's important here.
1064020	1066020	I am at 13 hit points.
1066020	1069020	As I'm holding Clark's leg, I look at both of them.
1069020	1071020	I'm like, why are you fighting?
1071020	1073020	What is happening?
1073020	1076020	I look at Kevin, or Kevin John.
1076020	1078020	I don't, I'm sorry.
1078020	1082020	I just, it just freaked me out.
1082020	1084020	I just, I'm sorry.
1084020	1090020	I look up at Kevin John and I just have a look in my, on my face of like, what the fuck?
1090020	1093020	Like John is just looking down at his body in confusion.
1093020	1097020	Guys, what the, what the fuck did we just see?
1097020	1099020	I mean, we're all burnt up.
1099020	1102020	We got Tildy, Maggie, Marvin.
1102020	1103020	Tildy.
1103020	1104020	Oh shit.
1104020	1105020	Oh, hey Clark.
1105020	1106020	Oh fuck.
1106020	1107020	I'm sorry, brother.
1107020	1108020	I remember now.
1109020	1112020	It seems like I failed a sanity check or something, but I'm sorry.
1112020	1114020	I'm awful sorry for shooting you in the leg.
1114020	1116020	We ought to solve this Tildy thing.
1116020	1117020	I shouldn't, I shouldn't have startled you.
1117020	1118020	I'm sorry, John.
1118020	1121020	Well, you know how I am when I get startled.
1121020	1124020	I just, I deserve to be shot real hard in the hip there.
1124020	1129020	That, that made sense.
1129020	1134020	The most forgiving role-playing character that has ever existed.
1134020	1137020	Remember you think you're a God now.
1137020	1141020	Keith stands up and opens the door to the mausoleum to let some light in here and to
1141020	1142020	get some fresh air.
1142020	1149020	Fresh air pours in, specifically shining a nice light on the corpse of your fallen coworker.
1149020	1155020	I go over to Ari's body and kind of look at both my fellow officers and start trying to
1155020	1158020	get her back into the coffin.
1158020	1163020	That way we can just leave here without feeling guilty and go fucking figure some shit out.
1163020	1167020	As you grab the lifter, the burn on your dominant hand just hurts.
1167020	1169020	So like an open wound.
1169020	1172020	So extremely painful when you go to grab her.
1172020	1175020	Try kicking her with the foot that weren't burned.
1175020	1181020	I just power through the pain of it and lift her up into the coffin, shut the coffin.
1181020	1184020	And I think where it's laying right here, it's good enough.
1184020	1186020	Nobody else needs to come into this mausoleum anyway.
1186020	1190020	So Clark is going to limp over back to the cloak and I'm going to pick it up and wrap it
1190020	1193020	around my waist as a giant makeshift bandage.
1193020	1194020	Absolutely.
1194020	1198020	Was there a book that old Clark was reading out of?
1198020	1201020	He had a piece of parchment that he was reading off of.
1201020	1203020	Is that anywhere around here?
1203020	1207020	You kind of saw it as he was chanting.
1207020	1213020	You saw the page kind of burn up and then turn into these lights that danced around you.
1213020	1216020	Any of you guys see, I guess, what the words were?
1216020	1218020	What the hell did he do?
1218020	1222020	I think maybe the words are on us now.
1222020	1227020	What does Tildy, Marvin, Drew and Maggie, what do they have in common?
1227020	1229020	Other than we all know them.
1229020	1233020	This is what old Clark is trying to emphasize to us.
1233020	1237020	These might be the four keys to what's going on here, these people.
1237020	1240020	Do you think their locations on our bodies mean anything?
1240020	1243020	If they do, I don't know what it is right now.
1243020	1244020	We can try to figure that out.
1244020	1247020	Drew is a pain in my back.
1247020	1253020	Well...
1253020	1260020	We thought Maggie was six feet under.
1260020	1264020	Keith, you saw Maggie, her body missing a foot, right?
1264020	1266020	That's true, yeah.
1266020	1268020	That makes sense.
1268020	1276020	I don't know what the others would mean, but we have gotten so distracted in the past 40 minutes.
1276020	1279020	Do you guys still want to go with this plan for Marvin Glass?
1279020	1283020	I mean, yeah, I think we should still try to call those guys.
1283020	1286020	I've got this handy wound here that makes it look like you guys shot me.
1286020	1288020	That's true.
1288020	1290020	Does it look like you guys shot me?
1290020	1291020	You're an even better Chewbacca.
1291020	1293020	I mean, it doesn't make it look like we shot you.
1293020	1297020	It literally is because he did.
1297020	1302020	What if we need to make these people eat these parts of themselves?
1302020	1304020	Let's focus less on that right now.
1304020	1306020	Do you have a better theory?
1306020	1310020	I don't have a better theory, but I think we ought to stick to the plan.
1310020	1314020	You don't think we need to make Tilde eat her palm and Marvin eat his chest and Drew eat his back and Maggie eat her other foot?
1314020	1316020	Well, I don't know where Tilde is, so...
1316020	1324020	Unless you have better suggestions, I say we get back to the police car as we were going to before we ran into the cops,
1324020	1328020	ran into this crazy fucking long-arm beast.
1328020	1330020	Let's get in the car.
1330020	1331020	Beast, you beast!
1331020	1341020	Give these FBI or not people a call and drive over to Marvin's and try to get some shit figured out before we fucking kill each other.
1341020	1344020	You can do whatever you want to once we get there.
1344020	1347020	Well, no, you can't. We do this teamwork.
1347020	1351020	We can talk about it on the car ride, but we do need a game plan.
1351020	1354020	Say it all goes off without a hitch and we're in, then what?
1354020	1359020	How about we get to the car first, get out of this fucking cemetery. How about that? Let's do that.
1359020	1362020	And I just turn heel and I walk out of the mausoleum.
1362020	1364020	I start limping out behind him.
1364020	1371020	You all limp out as the bottom of your left foot hurts so fucking bad with every step that you take,
1371020	1380020	and you limp past these three dead android dudes and you keep moving through these crypts, these above-ground tombs,
1380020	1388020	these mausoleums of the city cemetery, and you make your way to the parking lot where there are only two cars present.
1388020	1397020	Keith Vigna's contention police department cruiser and Clark Bishop's silver Honda Accord provided by the Circle of Knowledge.
1397020	1401020	Do you have anything in your car you need to get out before we head on out?
1401020	1406020	Let me check. Anything in that car? I'll open up the glove box.
1406020	1411020	Yeah, as long as you brought your guns and your couple phones with you, then you're good to go.
1411020	1413020	It's all on my person.
1413020	1418020	Let me make a stop by the city free clinic real quick and see if we can't get patched up by Sawbones.
1418020	1420020	They might ask us why we all have...
1420020	1423020	That's why we go to the free clinic, not the emergency room.
1423020	1429020	Well, you do have the best drive, so I assume you're going to be driving and you can take a pit stop if you want.
1429020	1432020	And then he looks at me and he's like, what the fuck does that mean?
1432020	1434020	You're the best driver, is what I meant to say.
1434020	1438020	I'm hurt pretty bad, fellas. It wouldn't bother me at all.
1438020	1440020	Okay, let's do that then.
1444020	1446020	Hey, watch out!
1457020	1465020	Welcome to the city free clinic where all your troubles are hurts.
1468020	1470020	Want to take another pass at that?
1470020	1477020	Welcome to the free clinic in the city where all your free troubles are taken care of by the pain that stops.
1479020	1481020	Seems like something's been lost in translation.
1482020	1487020	I go up to the front counter and I'm like, hey, my buddy's hurt and I got a burn on my foot. Can you help me?
1487020	1489020	Yeah, of course, we can help you.
1489020	1493020	And I'm about five points shy of normal myself, if you know what I mean, so...
1493020	1498020	Yeah, sure, go ahead and fill out these forms and wait in the waiting room until we call your names.
1498020	1502020	I put down Rex Thrasher for my name.
1502020	1503020	Very cool name.
1503020	1505020	I put in Peter Deeter for my name.
1505020	1510020	Clark writes down Clark Bishop and then looks at your guys' sheets and then just crosses it out.
1513020	1515020	And he writes down...
1515020	1517020	Clark Chisup.
1519020	1524020	He writes down Chaz Fauntleroy.
1525020	1527020	Chaz Fauntleroy.
1527020	1529020	Lil Chaz Fauntleroy.
1531020	1535020	Okay, let's roll a bureaucracy check.
1535020	1536020	Oh!
1536020	1537020	Hell yeah.
1537020	1538020	I happen to have some of that.
1538020	1539020	I have some of that too.
1539020	1540020	I have 50 bureaucracy.
1540020	1541020	I got 30.
1541020	1550020	Okay, so here's what I'm going to do. Whoever has the highest is going to roll, but the other two can roll to assist in this since you're all together.
1550020	1555020	For each success, I'll give a plus 10% bump to whoever's got the highest.
1555020	1556020	I've got a 40.
1556020	1557020	I have 50.
1557020	1558020	30.
1558020	1559020	I rolled a 16.
1559020	1560020	Hell yeah.
1560020	1561020	So we don't need it, right?
1561020	1562020	Oh yeah, you don't need it.
1562020	1564020	Yeah, you just take care of business.
1564020	1571020	And sir, what is the format on which the payment will go through on the forms?
1571020	1574020	If you bill it to the First Church of Contention.
1574020	1576020	Oh yeah, absolutely. They have an account with us.
1576020	1578020	Thank you so much for coming in.
1578020	1583020	Everyone roll a D4 and gain that many hit points back.
1583020	1584020	Where's that one I handed?
1584020	1585020	Oh, there it goes back to you.
1585020	1586020	Four!
1586020	1587020	Woo!
1587020	1588020	Three!
1588020	1589020	Woo!
1589020	1590020	Three, but I only need one to get back up to max.
1590020	1592020	Give one to Joe.
1592020	1593020	Two.
1593020	1595020	That puts me at a 16.
1595020	1596020	I'm at 19.
1596020	1597020	I'm at 25.
1597020	1600020	You guys roll out back to the parking lot feeling much better.
1600020	1603020	It's 2 p.m. The sun is high in the sky on December 6th.
1603020	1606020	It's still a pretty cold day here in the city.
1606020	1607020	Which cars did you bring both of them?
1607020	1609020	I think we all hopped into the PD car.
1609020	1611020	Oh, that's right. I was there.
1611020	1613020	So, what would you like to do?
1613020	1614020	Okay.
1614020	1615020	It's time to Chewbacca it.
1615020	1616020	We're gonna go.
1616020	1620020	You guys were gonna call while you went to Jim Cook's house to go look at the book?
1620020	1623020	Oh, that's right. We're gonna go to the book and then go to Marvin's. That's right.
1623020	1630020	So, we call the FBI in quotation marks.
1630020	1634020	I was just waiting for Taylor to finish ringing.
1634020	1640020	You hear the click and then you hear an automated voice say,
1640020	1647020	Thank you for calling. For prompt service, please identify yourself and any associates.
1647020	1652020	Keith Vigna, Clark Bishop, John Lee Pettymore III.
1652020	1655020	Thank you. Has the incursion been stopped?
1655020	1656020	No.
1656020	1659020	Thank you. Has the incident been covered up?
1659020	1661020	Yes.
1661020	1663020	Thank you. Is that all?
1663020	1667020	No, but I would like to talk to someone about it.
1667020	1669020	Thank you. Is that all?
1669020	1677020	I have nothing else to say to a robot. I would like to talk to the officers that I talked to a couple of days ago.
1677020	1679020	Thank you. Is that all?
1679020	1681020	Yes.
1681020	1682020	Thank you.
1682020	1684020	And the line goes dead.
1684020	1687020	Yeah, that robot wasn't really in a negotiating mood.
1687020	1688020	Not really.
1688020	1691020	We learned precisely jack shit from that.
1691020	1692020	Fuck.
1692020	1694020	Can I go pee real quick?
1694020	1699020	Just piss your pants, Luke. I mean, they are yellow.
1699020	1703020	You can see a picture of Luke's pants on the Instagram page at PretendingPod.
1703020	1705020	I peed my pants.
1705020	1708020	You can see an after picture after he peed his pants.
1708020	1709020	Only on Instagram.
1709020	1710020	Only on Instagram.
1710020	1711020	And they got more yellow.
1711020	1712020	I'll put it on Twitter too.
1712020	1716020	So real fast on my breaking point that I just hit, does that take effect now?
1716020	1719020	We'll go ahead and just say like it'll take effect now.
1719020	1721020	I know that you like role playing wise, like.
1721020	1725020	Because we usually, it was when we went to bed, so I wasn't playing it too hard just now.
1725020	1726020	Sure, yeah.
1726020	1730020	You can just evolve into your character from here as you move forward.
1730020	1731020	Okay.
1731020	1737020	And then actually I said earlier that that was your final breaking point, but what was your sanity at when you hit that?
1737020	1741020	So I'm now at 18, so that makes me go down, so my next breaking point will be at 6.
1741020	1746020	At 6, so you'll gain another disorder at 6 sanity points.
1746020	1749020	As well as Thomas, when you hit your breaking point, what were you at?
1749020	1750020	I'm at 18 right now.
1750020	1751020	Gotcha.
1751020	1752020	And what's your power?
1752020	1753020	Power is 12.
1753020	1756020	Right, so then you'll also have another breaking point at 6.
1756020	1757020	Right, yeah.
1757020	1758020	Well now mine's at.
1758020	1759020	Oh, from earlier.
1759020	1760020	From earlier, yeah.
1760020	1761020	Sure.
1761020	1762020	I think it's 7.
1762020	1763020	Okay, cool.
1763020	1767020	So your next breaking point will be at 7, and then Luke just has one breaking point left.
1767020	1770020	Yeah, my next one is at 8, so after that I'll be bing bong.
1770020	1772020	I'll be a bing bong boy.
1772020	1773020	You'll go insane forever.
1773020	1776020	To join the ranks of all my other characters.
1776020	1778020	Have we ever talked about regaining sanity?
1778020	1779020	Can you do that in this game?
1779020	1783020	You know, there is a mechanic in Delta Green for regaining sanity.
1783020	1785020	Oh, it's going to the therapist, right?
1785020	1786020	It is, yeah.
1786020	1787020	So there's a couple ways that you can do it.
1787020	1788020	Oh, yeah.
1788020	1789020	Because we did that in one of the wonderful campaigns.
1789020	1793020	Yeah, when we had a campaign where we were doing shorter scenarios.
1793020	1798020	Shorter scenarios with home scenes in between is how you traditionally play Delta Green,
1798020	1802020	but I have given you guys no downtime in this campaign whatsoever.
1802020	1807020	And downtime is normally when you would bump stats, train new stats.
1807020	1812020	You might reconnect with your family, go to the therapist, any of those things.
1812020	1813020	We haven't done any of that.
1813020	1817020	We'll maybe try it on the next campaign to add that back in,
1817020	1819020	but for this one we're not going to worry about it.
1819020	1824020	And then as far as gaining sanity besides going to the therapist,
1824020	1830020	in a lot of Delta Green scenarios, at the end there will be bonuses for sanity.
1830020	1835020	If you take out a threat or whatever, then you can gain sanity back.
1835020	1840020	I'm all for that, but you guys have only done things that would lose sanity.
1840020	1841020	Right.
1841020	1848020	This campaign's not really meant to make you guys feel better in any way.
1848020	1849020	All right, cool.
1849020	1851020	So what is the plan?
1851020	1853020	You guys called and you were on your way.
1853020	1856020	We just got ourselves fixed up at the free clinic.
1856020	1857020	Yeah, we called.
1857020	1858020	Didn't get to talk to anybody.
1858020	1859020	Yep.
1859020	1862020	Although you told them that we wanted to talk to them and they said okay.
1862020	1863020	Right.
1863020	1867020	So I suppose that we will wait for a callback from them.
1867020	1869020	They'll probably call any minute.
1869020	1871020	I'm sure they will.
1871020	1875020	So John, I think you're going to be driving us to Jim's house.
1875020	1876020	All right.
1876020	1882020	While we're there, I want to tell you that we in the real world got these little notebooks from Joe,
1882020	1885020	which have fun Missouri facts on the back of them,
1885020	1890020	and they list one of our five primary crops as forage, and none of us knew what that was,
1890020	1896020	so I looked it up, and forage are crops grown specifically to be grazed by livestock or consumed as hay.
1896020	1897020	That was my guess.
1897020	1898020	Oh, that makes sense.
1898020	1899020	Makes sense.
1899020	1902020	It doesn't have to go on air, but I just looked it up and I wanted to tell you guys now.
1902020	1905020	To keep that methane pumping, baby.
1905020	1909020	We're an edutainment podcast now, technically speaking.
1909020	1917020	This is actually, there's going to be a pretty heavy shift towards Missouri agriculture facts in the coming weeks.
1917020	1921020	Which might prove controversial to some listeners, but...
1921020	1927020	If you didn't know, Kansas City is the largest city in Missouri, followed by St. Louis, followed by Springfield.
1927020	1928020	What?
1928020	1933020	But 66% of Missouri is covered in farmland, so we're lucky to not be farmers.
1933020	1934020	That's a pretty cool number.
1934020	1936020	Your family are farmers.
1936020	1939020	Dumb hillbilly farmers.
1939020	1943020	Rich, dumb hillbilly farmers.
1943020	1946020	You can pipe in the Missouri facts theme that we wrote here if you want.
1946020	1948020	Yes, that we recorded earlier.
1948020	1952020	Well, it's Missouri facts and we're going downtown.
1952020	1958020	You can post the back of this on the Instagram so all our followers can get their Missouri facts.
1958020	1960020	It's between our listeners.
1960020	1964020	If you want to know what the state animal or insect is, check out our Instagram.
1964020	1966020	Don't Google it.
1966020	1975020	But for more of this campaign, keep listening right now as we stop talking about Missouri.
1976020	1981020	Yeah, so the last time we decided was to go to Jim's.
1981020	1985020	Yeah, we're going to Jim's, looking for that book and anything else that might be of interest over there.
1985020	1990020	Clark directs you to the neighborhood that he was in earlier today, actually.
1990020	1997020	And as you guys are pulling in, you see that there are flyers put up on every poll.
1997020	2001020	And on each of these flyers is Clark Bishop's face.
2001020	2009020	Underneath it says, Clark Bishop, call cops if seen. Say, quote, violent EDP.
2009020	2013020	As cops, we know what EDP is and it means...
2013020	2016020	As cops, you know that violent EDP...
2016020	2018020	Oh, I don't have internet right now.
2018020	2020020	Why is the wifi down?
2020020	2021020	Oh, look it up.
2021020	2027020	In the meantime, did you know that the state fossil is the crinoid?
2027020	2029020	Emotionally disturbed person.
2029020	2037020	And that's a fun one because there's a lot of road cuts in the highways and stuff out through the limestone of the Ozark Mountains.
2037020	2039020	And you can go up there and just collect fossils.
2039020	2041020	Crinoids, trilobites.
2041020	2042020	Nice.
2042020	2043020	Dinosaur bones.
2043020	2046020	Thanks for that fun Missouri fact.
2046020	2049020	EDP is emotionally disturbed person.
2049020	2050020	That is right.
2050020	2051020	And you're a violent one apparently.
2051020	2054020	All of that is probably correct.
2054020	2063020	You drive through and you see all these suburban homes look the exact same, but Clark does point out one that says Jim Cook on the mailbox outside.
2063020	2067020	There it is.
2067020	2073020	As we pull in, I see one of these and I'm like, Clark, what did you do?
2073020	2074020	What are you talking about?
2074020	2078020	And I point to one of the flyers on a light pole.
2078020	2080020	Oh, shit.
2080020	2090020	I mean, I woke up on the driveway here and there was a jogger walking around.
2090020	2099020	He asked what I was doing here and I just told him I didn't know and I must have come off hanky to him or something.
2099020	2100020	I don't know.
2100020	2103020	But he left in a hurry after I talked to him.
2103020	2104020	Did you tell him your name or?
2104020	2106020	Yeah.
2106020	2109020	I told him I was an officer from contention.
2109020	2110020	Next time you should kill him.
2110020	2115020	Keith looks down at his feet, doesn't believe what Clark just told him, but shrugs it off.
2115020	2118020	I'll human what Clark just told me.
2118020	2121020	Would that be against something of mine or is it just if he passes or not?
2121020	2131020	You know, now that we've been rolling against each other for unarmed combat and now shooting each other, I think we could get to a point in time where you can human against each other.
2131020	2134020	So, Clark, you would roll human.
2134020	2139020	Or if he, like a liar, if he has a higher skill in persuade maybe, could he roll that versus my human?
2139020	2140020	Oh, I like that. Yeah.
2140020	2141020	Yeah.
2141020	2143020	So, whatever is higher, I think.
2143020	2146020	I got a 41 out of a 50 human.
2146020	2151020	I'm rolling on my persuade, which is a 40, and I fail.
2151020	2157020	I'm not telling you the whole truth, but I'm definitely telling you essentially what happened, but I am withholding something.
2157020	2159020	You know, Vigna, trust ish him.
2159020	2161020	I'm fine with that for now.
2161020	2163020	Let's just get in here, get this book and-
2163020	2166020	Before we go in, there's a few rules, all right?
2166020	2173020	You don't step on Superman's cake, you don't spit in the wind, and god damn it, you don't mess around with Jim.
2173020	2174020	Those are the rules.
2174020	2176020	Do you- you must-
2176020	2178020	Did you know Jim very well, Jon?
2178020	2180020	It's just a song, boys. Let's go.
2182020	2183020	Okay.
2183020	2189020	I look at both of them, kind of roll my eyes, and then walk into Jim's house.
2189020	2191020	The door is locked.
2191020	2193020	I use my lock picking skill to open the door.
2193020	2194020	Ooh, dope.
2196020	2197020	An 11 on a 50.
2197020	2198020	A crit.
2198020	2201020	A crit success. Do you want to describe how quick and smooth you are?
2201020	2205020	I flick the doorknob with my finger, and it just pops open.
2209020	2211020	Got the Fonzie touch.
2211020	2219020	It kind of hurt my fingernail, but I kind of wave it off and look back at the boys, open it up, and walk in.
2219020	2225020	As you guys walk in, the house smells kind of old, but in a nice, calming, familiar way.
2225020	2227020	There's an upright piano in the entry.
2227020	2235020	The living room has papers and binders strewn all over the coffee table, couch, chairs, the floor, really just everywhere all over this house.
2235020	2242020	The sun is shining in through the window, illuminating a fair amount of dust that is moving slowly upward.
2242020	2245020	Hey Clark, do you remember where this particular book is?
2245020	2249020	Clark starts walking toward where he last saw the book.
2249020	2258020	Clark, as you walk toward where you last saw the book, you walk through the kitchen, you see that the picture that you saw in the fridge is still there,
2258020	2264020	and sitting out on the kitchen counter are the other items that you saw when you came through here last time.
2264020	2271020	And then sitting out in the living room with all the papers and binders and stuff all over the place, you see this big book.
2271020	2276020	It's leather and thick, and it has a symbol on the front that you obviously have come to recognize.
2276020	2281020	It's the big circle. It's the Circle of Knowledge logo surrounded by six smaller circles.
2281020	2290020	And the thick leather book has a girthy wooden bookmark, and it is stuck toward the back of the book.
2290020	2295020	I pick up the book, and I just kind of lift it. This is the one I was talking about.
2295020	2299020	So is that bookmark, is that the only page you can open it up to?
2299020	2302020	Last time, for sure. Let me see if that's still the case.
2302020	2303020	It is.
2303020	2304020	Let's us try to open it.
2304020	2308020	Well, can you try to take the bookmark out and put it in a different page?
2308020	2309020	I'll give it a shot.
2309020	2317020	As you try to do that, the bookmark won't go into any other pages, and it is as if earlier said, as a magnet is almost keeping it away.
2317020	2320020	What happens when Keith and John try?
2321020	2330020	The three of you are all now hands and feet all in trying to pry this book open.
2330020	2334020	Keith is on the floor with his feet in the air, you know, kind of tugging on it.
2334020	2336020	Trying to get the boat shoe grip on there.
2337020	2340020	We should see if John has any WD-40.
2341020	2342020	Jim.
2342020	2345020	I should see if I have any WD-40.
2345020	2348020	Well, let's just take this with us.
2348020	2355020	It seems, I don't really know, I mean, why are we even coming to get this in the first place? Maybe as an offering or something?
2355020	2359020	Will you describe to them what they see on that page that it only opens up to?
2359020	2366020	Yeah, absolutely. So this book does open up to this one specific page, and it is written all over.
2366020	2370020	And over and over and over on this ancient parchment is the phrase,
2370020	2374020	It is only through death that he may rise again.
2375020	2378020	It, death, and he are all capitalized.
2379020	2389020	And drawn over this obsessive scrawl is a picture of a hooded figure that you just saw with a brilliant light shining from its maw.
2389020	2395020	So Maggie told me that this is some kind of sacred text to their circle.
2395020	2399020	She called it her dad's book even, like it was maybe his personal copy or something.
2399020	2403020	Well, hell, Clark, it almost sounds like they're talking about you.
2404020	2415020	Well, now that I've seen the picture and I've seen me, the old me, I'm starting to wonder that maybe I'm more important to their plans than I realized.
2416020	2417020	What did it say again?
2417020	2418020	Only through, oh.
2418020	2421020	It is only through death that he may rise again.
2421020	2422020	Hey, fellas, I died.
2423020	2424020	That's what I'm saying, man.
2424020	2425020	Oh.
2425020	2428020	And you rose again, and there's this picture in here.
2428020	2432020	Just for a record, Joe didn't put that together until just now, and I got chills.
2433020	2436020	It's some kind of, it's almost, it's prophetic.
2436020	2440020	You could be some kind of messiah, some kind of a child of prophecy.
2440020	2443020	I've been starting to believe that more and more lately.
2445020	2447020	There's a manic glint in your eye when you say that.
2448020	2456020	And I kind of, I look, the way that Clark said it and what I saw in his eye, I kind of start to believe it too.
2456020	2464020	You also, when you're going through this, you do feel on your person you have an envelope with a letter in it that you found right here that you still have with you.
2465020	2467020	What are you touching yourself for?
2468020	2472020	Oh, I forgot about this, and I pull it out.
2473020	2480020	Fellas, this is a, when I was trying to pry the book open to another page, this kind of flitted out of the book, and I hand it to him.
2480020	2493020	It is a letter written by Jim Cook that in detail refutes, quote, the revelation of the overseer, end quote, calling it the scratches of a broken man.
2494020	2502020	The letter then goes on to outline new guidelines, including the immediate reassignment of all members of the disposal unit.
2503020	2508020	And at the top of the page, it says, faith through knowledge is just called knowledge.
2508020	2513020	That faith through knowledge bit there, that's a, that's the motto of the circle.
2514020	2515020	Oh, okay.
2516020	2517020	As you guys are standing around.
2522020	2524020	You escaped me the first time.
2526020	2531020	Clark, do you feel like you did a pretty thorough and successful search of these papers the first time you were here?
2532020	2534020	It was so thorough that there was no chance of missing anything.
2535020	2536020	Excellent.
2536020	2537020	Incredible.
2538020	2541020	That's why you are, no, were the best cop on the force.
2542020	2543020	Now it's Drew.
2544020	2545020	I don't know, I think Drew might be.
2546020	2551020	If we're, if we're sharing now, I laid out a couple other interesting items on the counter in the kitchen there you can take a look at.
2552020	2553020	We go take a look at those.
2554020	2563020	As you guys go and take a look at those, Clark Bishop, you feel a drop hit your nose, just a little wet drop hit your nose.
2563020	2574020	And as it runs down to the tip of your nose, you inhale, you kind of, oh, and you snort in and it is, um, it's, it's vodka.
2575020	2576020	I look up, you know, like recognize it.
2577020	2578020	Oh yeah, there's a stain on the ceiling.
2579020	2580020	It's pooling.
2581020	2588020	You can see that the drywall is wet and hits you again, hits you again.
2588020	2594020	The two of you, as you go into the kitchen, you see that there are three items sitting out on the kitchen counter.
2595020	2605020	There's a Ziploc bag containing two small items, a single tarot card, the devil with several bullet holes in it, as well as a taxidermied baby squirrel.
2606020	2609020	There's also a leather holster for a firearm.
2610020	2614020	There isn't a gun in it, but there is a small bit of text tooled into the leather.
2614020	2621020	It says scientia morse est underneath it. It says dash K uppercase K.
2622020	2627020	And then there's also a ring. It's got some small little curly hairs on it.
2628020	2635020	It is smooth and silver with a little plateau on top. It is completely smooth with no markings.
2636020	2639020	What are the items in the, oh wait, are these all in the bag?
2639020	2644020	No, it's just a taxidermied baby squirrel and the tarot card with bullet holes in it.
2645020	2648020	Yes. The other two things, the leather holster and the ring are just sitting out.
2649020	2652020	I walk in to join the fellows. There's vodka dripping from the ceiling.
2653020	2654020	Is this a two story house?
2655020	2656020	Nope. I think it was.
2657020	2658020	Oh, it was.
2659020	2660020	Yeah. I went upstairs to get pants. I'm pretty sure.
2661020	2662020	Oh yeah. It's a two story house.
2663020	2664020	Is this a two story house?
2665020	2668020	Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely it is.
2669020	2671020	There's vodka dripping from the ceiling?
2672020	2676020	Yeah. Let's go check it out.
2677020	2681020	Before we go, I feel like there's a 30 percent chance that this holster belonged to Kevin. 33 percent.
2682020	2684020	So I just take that and put it on my belt and get my gun.
2685020	2689020	Did you find these and put them all here just cause you, what did you think?
2690020	2693020	I don't really know. I kind of wondered if that squirrel was the work of Julie Maxwell.
2694020	2696020	She was into taxidermy, but there's no way for me to know.
2696020	2703020	As soon as I heard, as soon as I saw that it was a taxidermy squirrel, I thought of Julie Maxwell and of that hat that I put on.
2704020	2705020	Well, hat.
2706020	2707020	Did you try the ring on?
2708020	2709020	I don't think I did.
2710020	2711020	Is it big enough to fit on any of my fingers?
2712020	2722020	Yeah. When you slip it on, there's a small glow on top of it on the flat part and the glow shows a small logo as you slip it on.
2722020	2728020	And the logo is an M created out of four double helices.
2729020	2730020	Wish I would have put that on.
2731020	2734020	Do I feel any different having it on or just that happens?
2735020	2737020	Nope. But now the Ringwraiths know where you are.
2738020	2739020	I look around.
2740020	2745020	Keith, you recognize that symbol? That was on the robot man we fought back at James's house.
2746020	2749020	Pretty sure that probably has something to do with Marvin Glass, I would assume.
2749020	2753020	Oh, yeah. That could be. Or Maggie.
2754020	2755020	What if Maggie's making robots?
2756020	2758020	What's the double helix then? Does that ring any bells?
2759020	2764020	I mean, other than what we saw stamped where the penis of the robot should have been.
2765020	2767020	But I mean, is that significant to Marvin or Maggie in any way?
2768020	2769020	Is it M?
2770020	2773020	Oh, no, no. I don't know. I'm just, I got Marvin on my mind.
2774020	2775020	Just the shape of DNA. I don't know.
2776020	2777020	Marvin!
2777020	2778020	I had a...
2779020	2780020	Marvin!
2781020	2783020	Sorry, I had Marvin on my mind.
2784020	2785020	God.
2786020	2792020	I had previously taken one of my shoelaces off to tie around my pants to keep it up.
2793020	2798020	I take the other shoelace off, slip it into the ring, and I'm wearing it around my neck now.
2799020	2800020	Dope. Love it.
2801020	2802020	Keith, I found that in a pile of pubes.
2802020	2809020	It could... I'm going to assume that it was just squirrel hair.
2810020	2812020	No, it was pubes. You might just want to wash it.
2813020	2814020	Midsummer spoilers.
2815020	2817020	Well, I just kind of... I kind of shake...
2818020	2822020	While it's around my neck, I shake it off and hope most of the pubes come off.
2823020	2825020	But at this point, there's some nice sunlight coming in through the kitchen window,
2826020	2829020	and you can see the pubes kind of swirl around in a nice...
2829020	2831020	And the American Beauty song starts playing.
2832020	2838020	At the end of the day here, one of the least concerns I have is touching pubes at this point.
2839020	2841020	When was that ever a concern for you?
2842020	2845020	That vodka was dripping from the ceiling in there.
2846020	2848020	I don't know much about construction of houses,
2849020	2852020	but that would have to be a lot of vodka upstairs to make it drip through the ceiling, right?
2853020	2854020	Let's go check that out.
2855020	2856020	I'll head on up there.
2857020	2858020	I follow behind him.
2859020	2866020	As you're walking through, there's a couple hallways, some rooms, couple rooms, a bathroom, a closet.
2867020	2872020	But you start to realize as you're walking in these doors that the vodka is spilling from a place
2873020	2878020	where there isn't a room that could actually put you in that spot in the living room.
2879020	2883020	Can I just put my ear to a wall that I think would lead to where that vodka would be coming from?
2884020	2888020	Yeah, as you put your ear to the wall where you think the vodka would be dripping from,
2889020	2893020	you actually do hear a slight static noise.
2894020	2898020	But if there was a room there, it seems like it's been maybe walled off or something.
2899020	2900020	Let's search for a door.
2901020	2905020	Well, we either search for a door or it's not there anymore. We need to bust in through it.
2906020	2907020	After we don't find a door, we can bust through it.
2908020	2910020	Would tapping on the wall reveal a door if there was one?
2911020	2912020	Or, you know, just a simple search rule.
2913020	2915020	That's kind of what I was envisioning.
2915020	2920020	With the three of you working together, let's have the two assist the one with the best search,
2921020	2923020	as we did earlier with the health that was unnecessary.
2924020	2925020	I've got a 40. I've got a 50.
2926020	2927020	I've just got the basic 20.
2928020	2931020	98. We're not going to find this door.
2932020	2933020	It doesn't even, it can't get me down to 50.
2934020	2935020	I could have found it with my search rule.
2936020	2937020	I rolled a 13.
2938020	2940020	I mean, we could have both helped him, but it's still the 78.
2940020	2946020	You know full well that there is an open room on the other side of this wall, but you cannot find a door to get there.
2947020	2952020	I want to use my athletics to just falcon kick this wall where there's not a stud.
2953020	2954020	Roll athletics.
2955020	2956020	43 on a 50.
2957020	2959020	Nice. Keith's foot is stuck in the wall.
2960020	2962020	I helped to pull him out.
2963020	2964020	No, no, no. Push him through.
2970020	2988020	How am I the only one trying to pull over?
2989020	2997020	How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?
2997020	3003020	There's no time to go.
3004020	3012020	There's no time to go.
