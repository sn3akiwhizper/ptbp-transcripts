0	2560	Bless this mess, my babies.
2560	5380	Damn, y'all are stinky.
5380	6560	Uh-oh.
6560	10240	It's your scent-spraying stepdad, Wolf the dog.
10240	15240	And I'm here stinking up the joint live from 694.2 PTBP,
16940	19800	the only radio station that offered
19800	22920	smell-o-listen for a time.
22920	24800	But we had to stop.
24800	26520	People died, man.
26520	28240	This episode's Howlin' with Wolf
28240	31760	is from at Sergeant Boondock on Twitter.
31760	34760	He tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,
34760	39160	which really puts the hell yeah in hell yeah, dude.
39160	41480	Mr. Sergeant Boondock would like me
41480	46480	to dedicate a big old smooch to Mrs. Sergeant Boondock.
47640	51200	Well, I guess I can cook up a little romance.
51200	53380	Prepare for a smooch.
54340	57300	Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.
57300	58760	Mwah.
58760	60660	Sorry, I don't know what came over me,
60660	62640	Sergeant Boondock on Twitter.
62640	65940	I was overcome with a strong passion.
65940	69900	I haven't given an auditory smooch in many a millennia,
69900	72960	according to my smooch calendar.
72960	76480	If you wanna make a saucy request of your stinky wolf,
76480	79140	tag the show at pretending pod on the internet.

99280	102100	Last time, the little twins recognized
102100	105860	and stared down Clark Bishop from a horrifying vessel
105860	108860	floating across the shimmering steel sea,
108860	111580	aboard this defaced bay boat,
111580	115660	the rabid ball holding Julie Maxwell's corpse
115660	119900	ripped at the bridge connecting the two stilted bunkers.
119900	122900	Keith, Don, and Jack leapt for the railing
122900	125020	of the little balcony outside
125020	127180	the second bunker's hatch door,
127180	129220	but Keith couldn't hold on.
129220	131540	He fell into the molten ocean
131540	135000	and became engulfed in the sea made of solder.
135000	137760	But Don D. Pettymore chanted some sort
137760	140720	of cancellation incantation
140720	144280	and each action by person, object, or ball
144280	146880	played out perfectly in reverse.
146880	150800	As the rope bridge came crashing down a second time,
150800	153520	Keith leapt for the railing of the little balcony
153520	156440	outside the second bunker's hatch door.
156440	159540	But this time, with a little hindsight,
159540	164160	to everyone's delight, he held on with all his might.
164160	167800	So make like a beans and Keith holding on tight.
167800	172300	It's Dragon in 3 with What Kind of World Are You Living In.
172300	177300	["What Kind of World Are You Living In"]
202300	207300	["What Kind of World Are You Living In"]
212300	214300	How many apples can you fit in your butt, Thomas?
217300	220300	I don't have numbers like you and Luke.
221300	225300	So, Taylor and I started saying ditto a lot.
225300	230300	I don't know who started it, but then we were, like, kind of playing with the word
230300	233300	and saying different iterations.
233300	238300	So, there for a minute it was just, like, ditty, ditty, dits.
238300	242300	And now, if we agree with each other, we just go, big dits.
242300	244300	Big dits.
244300	245300	Big dits.
245300	246300	But then...
246300	247300	Big ol' ditties.
247300	248300	Big ol' ditties.
250300	255300	So then I said, big ol' ditties, and she was like, no. Too far.
256300	259300	Yeah, that's why I'm really the one for you.
260300	262300	Yeah, dude. Diddy Kong.
268300	271300	And Luke's our sub, who we call Diddy Kong.
273300	275300	I want bananas.
275300	277300	Cause they're your peanuts.
277300	279300	Oh, Diddy.
279300	280300	Diddy Dong.
280300	281300	Diddy Dong.
282300	286300	Well, this is really funny, but we probably can't use that.
286300	287300	Diddy Dong.
287300	288300	Why?
288300	292300	I don't know, can we say that we're gonna have a three-way sub-relationship
292300	297300	with Luke where he sucks our penises and calls them bananas cause he's Diddy Dong?
298300	301300	I think we can, and I think you summed it up pretty well.
301300	303300	Yeah, that's what I thought we were doing.
303300	306300	Okay, well, if that's not, you know, insensitive...
306300	307300	To Luke?
308300	310300	To Nintendo fans.
310300	311300	To N-
311300	313300	Yeah, to Nintendo fans.
319300	320300	Sorry, everybody.
320300	325300	I just don't want to cross the line of joking into, like, fetishization or even, like, otherization.
325300	329300	Right. Well, then the listeners can know that you feel that way.
331300	332300	God damn it.
334300	337300	And I'll keep calling Luke Diddy Dong for the whole episode.
340300	341300	Oh, God.
343300	344300	I rolled a 48.
344300	345300	Diddy Dong!
345300	346300	Oh, fuck yeah.
349300	354300	You did this, Thomas. You forced my hand. Now it's all in.
354300	357300	You can take the part out where I'm a little bitch about it.
359300	366300	But that's our new intro, like, thing, is that we say fucked up stuff until Thomas goes,
366300	370300	I don't think we can put this in there, and then we start the episode.
371300	375300	I'll cut you saying the word bitch, though, you sexist fuck.
376300	378300	Keith Vidner grabs onto the railing.
379300	382300	You gendered, slur-using son of a bitch.
382300	385300	All right, so Keith grabs onto the railing.
392300	394300	Zach, are you okay?
398300	400300	Keith grabs onto the railing.
400300	407300	And this time, all the sweat got wiped off my hands the last time I grabbed it,
407300	411300	and somehow the reverse, you know, didn't put the sweat back on my hands,
411300	417300	so I go slightly to the left of where I jumped last time to avoid the puddle of sweat,
417300	419300	and I grab on with all my strength.
419300	424300	In the distance, you just hear what sounds like a door hitting the inside of a metal wall.
431300	432300	Don't.
432300	433300	Echoes.
435300	438300	I hear, but I don't even have time to think about it.
438300	443300	Can I try to pull myself up this round or, I guess, probably not?
443300	445300	You guessed right. Clark, it's your turn.
447300	449300	I mean, there's nothing to do.
449300	460300	Clark and Jon both brush their hands and say, mission accomplished.
463300	466300	It looks like Keith made it this time.
466300	471300	This time, I'm saying this time because we went back in time.
471300	472300	Did that happen to you, Jon?
472300	475300	Yeah, it felt like we did a little rewind, a little Prince of Persia there.
475300	478300	Or do we have any recollection of that handler?
478300	482300	You absolutely remember it, and you absolutely need to roll a sanity.
485300	487300	Oh, hell yeah, I fail.
490300	492300	I fail too, but not over my power.
492300	494300	Oh, I failed over my power.
494300	498300	I critically failed and over my power.
498300	500300	It's a 66.
500300	504300	Oh, wow. Well, now I'm not locked in here with you.
504300	506300	I'm locked in here with you.
508300	515300	Fool me twice.
515300	517300	You can't fool me again.
517300	519300	You ain't going to Rorschach me again.
519300	524300	All right, so with that, you all lose one sanity.
524300	529300	This was a zero slash one, so Clark, you still only lose one.
529300	532300	We're in a room of junk, and I'm frustrated.
532300	534300	I would just start chucking things against walls.
534300	536300	I just threw a door. You saw me do that.
536300	538300	I'm going to just keep on chucking shit.
538300	540300	Where the fuck are we? Get out of here.
540300	542300	God damn it.
542300	546300	And as you're chucking junk across the room,
546300	549300	you pick up the golf club you found earlier,
549300	553300	and you fling it, and as it leaves your hands,
553300	555300	you think you're throwing it at the wall,
555300	558300	but it just kind of flips out of control.
558300	563300	Putter head over handle flies toward Leo piston,
563300	571300	and the putter part just sinks directly into the bullet hole in him,
571300	575300	and he's just like, yay!
575300	580300	No, Clark! Clark!
580300	583300	And he leans back over, and you're still,
583300	585300	I mean, you're just not even paying attention.
585300	588300	You're just throwing shit. Don V. Pettymore, you're up.
588300	590300	I'm assuming I also went back,
590300	593300	so I need to re-grab onto the thing.
593300	594300	Yeah. Okay.
594300	596300	My ding-dang dexterity.
596300	599300	Oh, I didn't even think about what if we save Keith,
599300	603300	and then lose both Don and Jack.
603300	605300	Two for one deal.
605300	609300	I'm willing to take that risk.
609300	612300	36 on a 55 for my dexterity.
612300	613300	Nice. Yep.
613300	615300	Don grabs some steady footing
615300	618300	as this rope bridge is crumbling beneath him,
618300	621300	and he, not crumbling, just moving, just falling.
621300	623300	I feel like Don D. in this moment would be like,
623300	627300	oh, shit, knowing that he has to complete that jump again.
627300	629300	He's like, oh, son of a bitch.
629300	630300	It went back further than you expected.
630300	632300	Yeah, I thought I was just going to be hanging out,
632300	634300	and I'm like, oh, fuck.
634300	636300	But you oh, fuck your way right across
636300	642300	and grab onto the railing that is right outside the hatch
642300	650300	on this stilted room above the shiny, shimmering silver sea.
650300	652300	John, it's your turn.
652300	654300	Keith, Don, are you okay?
654300	656300	I am now.
656300	660300	About melted in half, it felt horrible.
660300	663300	Yeah, I saw. That looked very unpleasant.
663300	666300	It's okay. I have no residual pain from it,
666300	668300	no lasting effects at all,
668300	670300	and my hands aren't sweaty anymore.
670300	672300	You didn't feel it mature you at all,
672300	674300	like you passed through a crucible,
674300	678300	came out maybe a little mentally tougher, older?
678300	682300	I don't know. I'd say maybe I have lost enough sanity
682300	686300	and rolled over my power and am at a breaking point,
686300	688300	past my breaking point.
688300	691300	Oh, hell, that's one hell of a way to put it.
691300	693300	I think Clark's at that point, too.
693300	697300	And you see a folding table fly over John's shoulder
697300	699300	and crash into the sea.
700300	703300	Well, I guess we'll probably explore that with you
703300	705300	pretty soon here.
705300	708300	I'm going to go check on Clark.
708300	711300	Can I calm him down at all with persuade or...
711300	713300	Yeah, if you have psychotherapy,
713300	715300	that is what it is meant for,
715300	717300	so if you need to roll persuade,
717300	719300	then you'd take a negative 20.
719300	722300	Okay, I'll try a negative 20 on my persuade,
722300	724300	which is a 60.
724300	725300	Fuck.
725300	728300	59, that would have been excellent.
728300	731300	So very ineffectively...
731300	735300	Clark, I know we've seen a lot of fucked-up shit,
735300	737300	and now your whole chronology...
737300	740300	Yeah, he's got a little folding chair
740300	742300	that he's using as a shield,
742300	745300	and he's deflecting some incoming shots.
748300	750300	Please!
750300	752300	I don't like shots.
754300	755300	Please!
755300	757300	But, like, basically, just don't, like...
757300	759300	I guess just don't worry about it,
759300	761300	and your life will always be like this now,
761300	764300	so why even, you know, don't stress out?
765300	769300	Jack Russell is running and making a jump.
770300	771300	Fails.
771300	773300	Oh, no!
773300	775300	Bye-bye, Jackie.
775300	776300	He grabs...
776300	779300	You can't take Jack from me!
780300	782300	He grabs Keith by the legs
782300	785300	and takes him down with him.
785300	787300	Takes his huge pants down.
787300	790300	But the shorts make for a huge parachute,
790300	793300	and he's floating up and away.
798300	800300	And then he's gone.
800300	803300	The twinkle star in the sky,
803300	806300	he just disappears like Team Rocket.
806300	812300	Okay, so Jack Russell is going to begin falling,
812300	814300	and as he makes the jump for it,
814300	816300	he hits his head.
816300	818300	He, like, grabs on to the railing,
818300	821300	but then his head kind of slams into the room,
821300	823300	and he immediately just lets go,
823300	825300	and he starts falling,
825300	827300	and he's falling on his back,
827300	829300	and he's kind of, like, rotating backwards,
829300	832300	so you think his neck is probably gonna land first.
833300	835300	It's the ball's turn.
836300	840300	It shrieked.
840300	844300	The moment that it reversed all of its actions
844300	847300	back to where it was in time...
853300	855300	All of that got noise.
855300	857300	Yeah, all of that got blocked by Discord.
857300	860300	It was like, there must be a wild animal in Zach's apartment.
866300	869300	Aiden and Alice Little are looking at their hands
869300	872300	where they just held lollipops,
872300	874300	but then, for some reason,
874300	878300	we're forced to put the lollipops back into their overalls.
878300	881300	Jon standing at the open door is just, like, pointing at Don,
881300	883300	like, he did it, he did that to you.
885300	888300	I just didn't want them to put a missing, like,
888300	889300	taking our candy away from them
889300	891300	on top of everything else that had happened.
897300	899300	Holy shit.
899300	900300	Okay.
901300	904300	Ooh, 69.
904300	905300	Uh-oh.
905300	910300	Jack Russell does not hit the ocean, so that's good.
910300	912300	However, the reason he doesn't hit the ocean
912300	914300	is because one long metal tendril
914300	917300	flies out towards him and skewers his neck
917300	920300	right in between his head and his shoulders.
920300	923300	It goes all the way through,
923300	926300	about five yards past him as well,
926300	930300	and so as the long, long metal limb
930300	936300	is just horizontal above, parallel with the ocean,
936300	940300	the body of Jack Russell is, like, hanging from it
940300	942300	like a foosball player,
942300	947300	but the stake is going through his neck.
947300	951300	Because of his, like, rotation as he was falling,
951300	953300	he is like a foosball player,
953300	957300	kind of spinning around by his neck.
957300	960300	The metal tendril rips backwards
960300	964300	and brings the body of Jack Russell with it,
964300	968300	and so now two of its tendrils are holding up bodies,
968300	972300	one being Julie Maxwell, the other Jack Russell,
972300	976300	as two of the other tendrils are in the melting,
976300	979300	shimmering silver sea.
979300	982300	They've kind of climbed out to find purchase
982300	986300	within the waters, made of the same texture
986300	990300	but in a different state than itself.
990300	992300	Keith, it is your turn.
992300	994300	Keith is pulling himself up to get up
994300	996300	and get on, like, level ground,
996300	998300	and as he's saying it, he looks over at Don
998300	1003300	and is like, thanks, don't use that on him.
1003300	1006300	And with a 12, I pull myself up.
1007300	1011300	I think Don gives, like, a menacing glare back to him,
1011300	1012300	but doesn't say anything.
1012300	1015300	You pull yourself up and can stand on this balcony
1015300	1018300	that is outside of this stilted room
1018300	1020300	with the hatch door right next to you.
1020300	1022300	Yeah, as soon as I actually get up on there,
1022300	1024300	I think about what just happened to me,
1024300	1028300	and it's not computing.
1028300	1030300	With that, I need Joe, Thomas, and Justin
1030300	1032300	to take off their headphones.
1032300	1033300	Ooh.
1033300	1034300	Luke, Luke, Luke?
1034300	1037300	Yeah, I'm a crazy guy.
1039300	1041300	You fuck so good, though.
1041300	1042300	Did he, Don?
1042300	1043300	I'm on top of it.
1043300	1045300	I need you to...
1045300	1046300	You hit a breaking point, you said?
1046300	1050300	Yeah, over my power, loss of sanity, breaking point.
1050300	1051300	All the...
1051300	1052300	All right.
1052300	1053300	Hitting them all.
1053300	1054300	All the things.
1054300	1056300	So I need you to roll three times.
1056300	1057300	A D100, right?
1057300	1059300	Yes, please.
1059300	1061300	A 61.
1061300	1063300	A 3.
1064300	1065300	And 80.
1065300	1069300	61 is kleptomania,
1069300	1071300	irrational compulsion for stealing.
1071300	1073300	Okay.
1073300	1076300	3 is acluomania,
1076300	1079300	an excessive liking for darkness.
1079300	1080300	Okay.
1080300	1083300	And 80 is phasmomania,
1083300	1086300	an obsession with ghosts.
1086300	1089300	I'm gonna say because of where I am
1089300	1090300	when this happened,
1090300	1093300	and it's, you know, dark and gooey
1093300	1096300	and all the colors and also other stuff, right?
1096300	1097300	Yep.
1097300	1099300	The second one, compulsion for the dark.
1099300	1100300	Yeah, okay.
1100300	1105300	So you are going to have acluo, acluo, acluo.
1105300	1106300	Acluomania.
1106300	1110300	An excessive liking for darkness.
1110300	1112300	I like it.
1112300	1116300	And then you are now extremely paranoid.
1116300	1119300	I know what this is gonna manifest as.
1119300	1123300	All right, let's get him back.
1123300	1132300	Birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy.
1132300	1134300	I feel birded.
1134300	1136300	Bird, bird, bird, bird, bird, oran.
1136300	1139300	You know that one, classic one.
1139300	1141300	My favorite bird too.
1141300	1144300	Yeah, I kind of like look off in the distance for a second,
1144300	1146300	and then I look at Don.
1146300	1148300	Yeah, he's hanging there off the railing,
1149300	1155300	I walk over to where he is and I start stepping on one of his fingers.
1155300	1159300	Oh, shit.
1159300	1162300	Okay, roll against each other.
1162300	1164300	Oh, I hope I lose.
1164300	1167300	What am I rolling, strength or?
1167300	1170300	You can either like try to hold on tight,
1170300	1173300	or you can try to like move your hands away from where he's stepping.
1173300	1175300	What am I rolling?
1175300	1177300	What am I rolling?
1177300	1179300	This is a very important number.
1179300	1183300	I guess unarmed combat, I guess is technically what it is.
1183300	1186300	I crit, succeed.
1189300	1190300	No.
1190300	1191300	Jesus Christ.
1191300	1194300	Can I just like tough it out, or is that like not really an option?
1194300	1195300	Should I try and move?
1195300	1196300	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1196300	1200300	So you could roll like constitution to tough it out, yeah.
1200300	1202300	That's what I think I'd do because I don't want to move.
1202300	1203300	Wait, wait, I lied, I lied.
1203300	1205300	I was looking at the wrong sheet.
1205300	1206300	Did you crit fail?
1206300	1209300	I only have a 40, so I crit fail.
1209300	1210300	Oh.
1210300	1212300	I was looking at Clark's.
1212300	1214300	Should I still roll?
1214300	1216300	Whoa, sneaky.
1216300	1218300	Yeah, go ahead and roll.
1218300	1221300	What if I crit fail worse?
1221300	1224300	I didn't, I got a 35 on a 60.
1224300	1229300	You're like, you go to step, you go to step on Don's fingers,
1229300	1233300	and a critical fail, huh?
1233300	1234300	Throw him back into the sea.
1234300	1235300	I know, right?
1235300	1237300	Yeah, he just slips and falls over the railing.
1237300	1238300	Undo everything.
1238300	1246300	And Don won't save him that time because he tried to step on his fucking fingers.
1246300	1247300	I don't have to die.
1247300	1250300	I don't think it's that.
1250300	1258300	My parachute pants open up and it slows me down so much that I can't even touch his fingers with my foot.
1259300	1262300	Oh my God.
1262300	1264300	There's an updraft in here.
1264300	1265300	What's updraft?
1265300	1266300	Nice.
1266300	1269300	Nice.
1269300	1275300	I slip on the puddle of sweat that's like dripped off of me.
1275300	1280300	Yeah, you slip on the sweat from your wet hands.
1280300	1283300	Oh, Keith Vigna, old wet hands.
1283300	1285300	What'd you do to my ankle?
1285300	1287300	I scream at Don.
1287300	1288300	That's right.
1288300	1289300	That's perfect.
1289300	1290300	Yes.
1290300	1291300	You like getting his face too.
1291300	1295300	Well, I'm on the ground, so I'm like face to face with him.
1295300	1296300	Screaming right in his face.
1296300	1298300	What'd you do to my ankle?
1298300	1303300	And I'm like grabbing my ankle and I'm like angry and very scared.
1305300	1306300	Clark, your turn.
1306300	1307300	Am I snapped out of it?
1307300	1308300	Yeah.
1308300	1314300	He starts to get his wits about him and he stops throwing things with his much vigor
1314300	1317300	and then slowly stops throwing things at all.
1317300	1318300	Oh, God.
1318300	1319300	Leo, I'm so sorry.
1319300	1320300	Oh, fuck.
1320300	1322300	Leo, I didn't mean it.
1322300	1324300	You were caught in the crossfire.
1324300	1325300	I'm sorry.
1325300	1326300	I didn't mean to do that.
1326300	1328300	It just happens sometimes.
1328300	1329300	I'm sorry.
1329300	1334300	And I try and help him get the putter out of the bullet hole.
1334300	1335300	Shit.
1335300	1336300	I'm sorry.
1336300	1337300	I'm sorry, Leo.
1337300	1338300	I didn't mean to do that.
1338300	1342300	Leo, you have to admit it was one hell of a throw.
1342300	1343300	That was one in a million.
1343300	1345300	Got you right in the hole, did I?
1345300	1346300	Dang it.
1346300	1347300	Dang it.
1347300	1348300	Dang my perfect throwing arm.
1348300	1353300	This hole is so big now you can fit like two apples in here.
1355300	1356300	Hole or sliced up?
1356300	1357300	Two.
1357300	1358300	Okay, rookie numbers.
1358300	1360300	John, we got to get out of here.
1360300	1362300	It's driving us mad.
1362300	1364300	We can't be staying here.
1364300	1366300	We got to – that ball's out there.
1366300	1370300	We got to – what are we going to do?
1370300	1372300	That's my turn.
1373300	1375300	Don, you're up.
1376300	1380300	Does Don know that he was about to get stepped on or did he just see –
1380300	1381300	I guess not.
1381300	1386300	– Vigna take one step and then tweak his ankle and fall over and start yelling at me?
1386300	1389300	And then he panic screams at you.
1393300	1395300	You guys are like face to face.
1395300	1398300	I'm going to pull myself up and I'm like, what happened to you, boy?
1398300	1400300	I shrink away from him in total fear.
1401300	1406300	I want to slap him in the face to like snap him back into reality.
1406300	1407300	That seems like Don.
1410300	1413300	Can I roll to resist getting slapped?
1413300	1419300	No, I think that with how panicked and freaked out Keith is, he's just going to take it.
1419300	1421300	I do a backhand too.
1421300	1423300	Front and back or just backhand?
1423300	1425300	Oh, both would be good though.
1425300	1427300	Let's say both.
1427300	1429300	Thanks for the recommendation, Luke.
1429300	1431300	Yeah, yeah, anything.
1431300	1438300	Yeah, I like pull up the shirt collar since he's on the ground and like holding his head in front of me just like whack, whack.
1438300	1440300	It's a big coral polo.
1440300	1444300	It's actually a little too tight on me so it pulls me right to him.
1444300	1446300	Not anymore. Not after this.
1446300	1447300	Yeah.
1447300	1450300	It's going to be a huge awkward neckline just hanging down.
1450300	1451300	Oh, God.
1451300	1452300	So unfortunate.
1452300	1454300	Snap out of it, boy.
1460300	1462300	Jon, your turn.
1462300	1468300	Jon hears the trademark shrieking whimper of someone who's just been slapped.
1468300	1469300	Snapped out of it?
1469300	1471300	Yeah, by a petty more uncle.
1474300	1484300	He takes inspiration and slaps Clark who has just screamed, what are we going to do?
1484300	1491300	And Jon smacks him twice across the face, grabs him by the shoulders and says, I don't know.
1494300	1496300	What kind of sound does Clark make?
1498300	1504300	Don D. Pettymore hears the echo of slaps happening.
1504300	1507300	A tear runs down his eye.
1509300	1511300	Ouchie, ouchie.
1512300	1513300	Oh, my God.
1513300	1515300	That boy might be a ball.
1515300	1517300	But he's a petty ball.
1517300	1519300	A petty ball.
1520300	1521300	Jon Lee petty ball.
1521300	1522300	Holy shit.
1522300	1524300	Ouchie, ouchie.
1524300	1526300	Ouchie, ouchie.
1531300	1534300	It's Jack Russell's turn and he's dead.
1538300	1540300	That's one less thing on your plate, Zach.
1540300	1542300	I didn't get to say two to a canoe.
1542300	1548300	I thought you were going to say as he got pulled away and he was dying, he'd be like, two to a canoe.
1548300	1550300	Two to a canoe, bro.
1550300	1552300	Oh, well, now's a good time for that.
1552300	1563300	So, yeah, he's still hanging there and his vocal cords are pushing against the metal tendril that's going through his neck sideways.
1563300	1573300	And so as he's talking, it reverberates through the metallic arm of this ball and it's like, two to a canoe.
1575300	1577300	Truly horrible.
1577300	1581300	Jon's just like, I don't get that reference personally.
1584300	1586300	None of us did, boy.
1590300	1592300	And then it's the ball's turn.
1593300	1597300	Just make him be nice. Just make him do a nice thing for us.
1597300	1598300	Yeah.
1598300	1599300	Yeah.
1599300	1600300	Yeah, Zach, you ever think of that?
1600300	1601300	Yeah, Zach.
1601300	1604300	The ball is coming for...
1606300	1608300	It's definitely Don. It's coming for Don.
1609300	1617300	He's the only one who's like, out of one of the rooms and he's standing above Keith, so Keith wouldn't be a target.
1617300	1626300	So the biggest target is Don D. Pettymore and this thing is flinging a metal tendril at you. What do you do?
1626300	1630300	Is the hatch near me the door to get into?
1630300	1636300	Yeah, in fact, you're in kind of a spot where you could slam open the door and use it as a shield.
1636300	1646300	I imagine it like if we were standing in the middle of the rope bridge, if the rope bridge was still attached to this second stilted bunker
1646300	1655300	and we were staring at the hatch, you would be with Keith holding him just to the left of this hatch
1655300	1666300	and you'd have to reach across this hatch door in order to pull it open, putting the door in between you and the metal tendril flinging toward you
1666300	1673300	but also putting the entrance to this bunker on the other side of the hatch from where you were standing.
1673300	1675300	Yeah, I think I'd try and get some kind of cover, basically.
1675300	1678300	If you slam the door open, it'll be between you and the arm.
1678300	1679300	Yeah.
1679300	1689300	Okay, so go ahead and roll either athletics, dexterity, strength maybe, I guess, or dodge doors.
1689300	1692300	If I got a good dodge, we'll see. Nope, dexterity it is.
1697300	1703300	Wait, hold on. Oh, 47 on a 55. I've never rolled this well in my entire fucking life.
1704300	1706300	What's going on there? What was that?
1706300	1707300	It was gross.
1707300	1708300	He's making kissy faces.
1708300	1709300	That's weird.
1709300	1711300	He made a kissy face, then he made a...
1711300	1713300	There's a ghost, a sexy ghost in his house.
1713300	1715300	Kind of linguist's face.
1716300	1717300	What are you guys talking about?
1717300	1718300	Taylor brought me food.
1718300	1720300	Oh.
1720300	1722300	Is it Taco Bell?
1722300	1724300	No, it's Subway, actually. I'm very confused.
1724300	1725300	Wow.
1725300	1726300	You gotta eat fresh.
1726300	1728300	Mm-hmm. Blimpies eat fresh.
1728300	1731300	It's called Blimpie. There's no S on the end.
1732300	1733300	It's not all B's.
1733300	1734300	Wait, really?
1734300	1736300	They rebooted it with a Z.
1736300	1737300	I didn't know that about Blimpie.
1737300	1738300	It's called Arby.
1738300	1744300	It's just one of my mini pet peeves. Specifically Blimpies. That's the only one that gets me for some reason.
1745300	1746300	So...
1746300	1747300	What about Arby?
1748300	1749300	That's what Thomas said.
1749300	1750300	We're going to Arby.
1750300	1751300	Yeah, that's what Thomas said.
1751300	1752300	Oh, sorry.
1754300	1755300	All right.
1755300	1756300	Back to your roll.
1756300	1758300	What about Arby?
1758300	1759300	Dude!
1759300	1760300	Dude!
1764300	1765300	Nice. Good one.
1765300	1766300	Because that one's plural.
1766300	1767300	Windy.
1767300	1768300	Possessive.
1769300	1770300	It's plural.
1772300	1773300	There are two Arby.
1777300	1778300	I passed.
1780300	1781300	With a 40.
1782300	1783300	Which is lower.
1783300	1784300	Which is...
1784300	1785300	Wait, is that good or bad?
1785300	1786300	I don't know.
1786300	1787300	That's good for you.
1787300	1788300	Yay!
1788300	1789300	Wait, what did you roll?
1790300	1791300	I rolled a 47.
1792300	1793300	Cool.
1793300	1794300	Hell yeah.
1794300	1797300	So you slam open this hatch door.
1797300	1801300	You just rip it open and it's blocking you and Keith.
1801300	1803300	You can't see the boat at all anymore.
1803300	1805300	You can't see this metal tendril coming toward you.
1805300	1817300	And then all of a sudden, the hatch door, which is made out of the same black, colorful, inky darkness, warps toward you.
1817300	1821300	Like something is pushing into it from the other side.
1821300	1830300	And it's almost as if a stretched out piece of cotton or a canvas is being pushed by a hand.
1830300	1835300	But it's this metal tendril trying to push and break through this hatch.
1835300	1836300	And it cannot.
1836300	1839300	And it kind of rubbery bounces back.
1839300	1843300	You can't see anything, but you seem to be safe.
1843300	1844300	You feel...
1844300	1846300	There's not a metal tendril inside of you.
1846300	1847300	So you did good.
1847300	1848300	Good job.
1848300	1849300	Yeah, thanks.
1852300	1853300	Jon, your turn.
1853300	1856300	Seeing that, Jon wants to quickly...
1856300	1857300	Hey, Jon.
1857300	1858300	Sorry.
1858300	1873300	When he flings open the hatch through the doorway, you do not see the inside of a room like the junkyard bunker that you are in.
1873300	1877300	You see a vast world.
1877300	1884300	The sky is the same inky darkness that is extremely, extremely...
1884300	1885300	Oh, wait.
1885300	1886300	No, it's not.
1886300	1889300	There's no color in it at all.
1889300	1892300	It's just darkness.
1892300	1897300	And the ground is made of pure light.
1897300	1902300	It seems kind of like we got screwed on the bunker lottery, Clark.
1902300	1906300	Looks like there's a world of pure light over on the other side.
1906300	1912300	That might be nice, instead of this junkyard fucking dying-ass Leo piston.
1912300	1914300	The cat fucker.
1914300	1916300	It may not be nice, actually.
1916300	1919300	I've seen a place like that before.
1919300	1921300	The Circle of Knowledge showed me that.
1921300	1926300	That's where that creature I saw that I'm so frightened of, that's where it lived.
1926300	1928300	That's where they were trying to keep it.
1928300	1931300	They were trying to keep it in that place.
1931300	1932300	Well, Don just opened a door.
1932300	1933300	I don't think that's...
1933300	1934300	That's probably not good.
1934300	1938300	I don't think it'd fit through that door, but that's probably not good that that door is open.
1938300	1940300	Shit.
1940300	1941300	I don't know.
1941300	1944300	Maybe it is best if we just stay here with the cat fucker.
1944300	1946300	But we probably should go get Keith.
1946300	1949300	I guess we gotta take Jack Russell's boat.
1949300	1950300	Is that how we get over there?
1950300	1951300	How are we gonna...
1951300	1952300	What are we gonna...
1952300	1960300	What if I just spent months in here, Bruce Wayne-ing myself in the ways of the ooze and learning how to manipulate it.
1960300	1964300	And then once I'm like a master, then we go outside and rescue everybody.
1964300	1967300	I forgot that you're doing that kind of thing with the ooze stuff now.
1967300	1971300	Do you feel like you have control over it in an effective way?
1971300	1973300	Can we use that to our advantage here?
1973300	1977300	It really does seem like the rules are stacked in my favor, so to speak.
1977300	1982300	But in another manner speaking, I don't want to break the game by being super powerful.
1982300	1987300	And just manipulating literally everything in the world.
1987300	1990300	This ball is one-shotting people.
1990300	1998300	I think now is the time to use any resource that you have available in order to not die or not let your friends die.
1998300	2005300	You know how when we went out the Marie Jacobs door and then we came around and we were at the same door again, we did like a loop-de-loop somehow?
2005300	2006300	Yeah.
2006300	2010300	Can you create a door that does that for us to get over there?
2010300	2013300	Let me think about that.
2013300	2020300	John walks over to the wall and puts his hands on his hips and kind of considers for a moment.
2020300	2024300	And he touches the top and he touches the bottom.
2024300	2027300	And he closes his eyes and takes a deep breath.
2027300	2029300	And I roll unnatural.
2029300	2033300	And he passes with a 37.
2033300	2035300	Whoa.
2035300	2048300	Looking through this portal that you've just created, John Lee, Kevin Moore III, and Clark Bishop see a metal tendril pulling back away from this portal.
2048300	2057300	And the view that you're looking through seems to be from the side of the hatch that was just penetrated by this metal tendril.
2057300	2062300	You're like looking out of that hatch somehow.
2063300	2067300	So if you walk through, then you'd be on the other side from Don and Keith.
2067300	2071300	So it's about to come flying through this portal at us?
2071300	2073300	It's pulling away right now.
2073300	2075300	Right. But it's probably going to hit again, right?
2075300	2077300	In two turns? Yeah, probably.
2077300	2081300	One of those is Jack Russell, though, and he's dead.
2081300	2085300	Oh. Two turns, not two rounds. Okay.
2085300	2087300	You don't know that to be true.
2087300	2089300	Right. Of course not.
2089300	2090300	You did it, John. You did it.
2090300	2092300	Yeah, on the wrong side of the door, though, I think.
2092300	2098300	I mean, John, I was just warning you that that thing is in there, but at this point, maybe getting in there, maybe the ball can't get in there?
2098300	2101300	I mean, any place is better than this if the ball's going to kill us.
2101300	2103300	Can I hear this conversation?
2103300	2107300	You're kind of, yeah.
2107300	2113300	Strangely enough, you're hearing it from the other side of the hatch door.
2113300	2116300	You can hear Clark and John having this conversation.
2116300	2119300	Clark? Is that you?
2119300	2121300	John? Oh, shit.
2121300	2122300	And I'm still laying on the ground?
2122300	2124300	Well, now that gives me an idea.
2124300	2127300	John closes the portal.
2127300	2131300	I just realized your turn was opening the portal.
2131300	2135300	Okay. Oh, no. That's fair.
2135300	2140300	The ball.
2140300	2142300	Crit fail.
2142300	2145300	So this ball is, like, so freaked out.
2145300	2152300	I mean, this thing is just making these noises, these, like,
2152300	2159300	just like aggressively poking at things, you know, trying to just, like, catch bodies, seemingly trying to collect.
2159300	2161300	But it's like out of control.
2161300	2169300	As you open this portal, you see one of these long metal tendrils just flies up through into the portal.
2169300	2177300	It's like trying to, like, get one of you, but it just completely misses as John closes the portal.
2177300	2185300	And this metal tendril just falls in this Leo piston junk bunk yard bunker stilted room.
2185300	2188300	And it wriggles for, like, half a second.
2188300	2190300	And then it just stops.
2190300	2192300	You were right, John.
2192300	2195300	It doesn't, it can't, or, I don't know.
2195300	2201300	I don't know. I don't know what that means to us.
2201300	2203300	You injured it. You injured it. That's a good thing.
2203300	2204300	Yeah.
2204300	2219300	And through the John made hole in this, in the side of this room that's still there, you hear this thing, like,
2219300	2222300	Keith, it's your turn.
2222300	2228300	Keith heard Jack Russell kind of, like, yell something as he was being taken away.
2228300	2230300	And it sounded like a spell to Keith.
2230300	2233300	And he knew that Don just cast a spell.
2233300	2236300	So Keith is thinking that he was trying to cast a spell.
2236300	2238300	So Keith starts saying,
2238300	2254300	That's so good.
2254300	2256300	Amazing. Clark, it's your turn.
2256300	2260300	He wants to kick the metal tendril that is now on the ground.
2260300	2264300	What kind of texture and material sensation do I get from it?
2264300	2265300	Is it solid metal?
2265300	2268300	It's like a hard, hard, solid, shiny metal.
2268300	2273300	That was good work, John. I mean, that's, you created a portal.
2273300	2277300	It just was kind of an inopportune time, but that's the kind of thing we need now.
2277300	2282300	If we can time it right, we could either us go over there or just bring them back to our side.
2282300	2288300	Yeah, I just don't think it ever works out with the turn order.
2288300	2290300	I just don't think this happens while we're in combat.
2290300	2291300	You can wait.
2291300	2296300	What if I waited a moment and chose the time I would strike?
2296300	2299300	Yeah, I think that's probably for the best.
2299300	2303300	I'll trigger it to set off right after your turn.
2303300	2306300	I'll skip this turn, wait till the end of your turn,
2306300	2314300	and so the portal will open right before Don's turn in a manner of speaking.
2314300	2317300	I guess we can talk about turn order out of character.
2317300	2320300	That's fine. That's part of our plan.
2320300	2322300	Yeah, I will trigger this. Yeah, I'll do all that.
2322300	2326300	I'll trigger this action to go off after your next turn, Joe,
2326300	2330300	so that it'll open up and Don can run through it on his turn and bring Keith with him.
2330300	2335300	So that just means that they have to survive whatever the ball does on this round, right?
2335300	2336300	Yeah.
2336300	2338300	Yep, and it's Don's turn.
2338300	2344300	So I saw the tendril whiz into the door and then get cut off, basically.
2344300	2346300	You heard it freaking out.
2346300	2351300	Yeah, if you poke your head around the door, then you would see it's not the whole tendril.
2351300	2355300	Half the tendril is recoiling, and it's losing its mind.
2355300	2358300	Or mind. It's losing its ball.
2358300	2360300	It's marbles.
2360300	2366300	I think I'd just stay in a good defensive spot, preparing for another strike.
2366300	2371300	Keith's like, chant this spell with me, to do hakanu.
2371300	2373300	Does Don know what that does?
2373300	2379300	You would recognize it as a mispronounced phrase that your old buddy Jack Russell used to say all the time
2379300	2381300	when two of you were on the boat together.
2381300	2383300	Oh, he said two? Oh my god.
2383300	2385300	Oh, it's absolutely perfect. Oh, he just got it.
2385300	2389300	Oh, it's so good that it's just me and you, because we've got two to a canoe here.
2389300	2391300	Two to a canoe.
2391300	2393300	Two to a canoe. Two to a canoe.
2393300	2396300	Oh my god, I can't believe I didn't realize what that was.
2396300	2400300	Yeah, I had no idea. I thought it was a reference I wasn't getting, which it was.
2400300	2402300	Yeah, I was like, what the fuck are you talking about?
2406300	2409300	I'm like, I feel like I'd just be like, now stay close to me, boy.
2409300	2413300	We gotta survive this, and I'll like, is he near me, or were you like, scooting away from me?
2413300	2415300	You're like, standing over me.
2415300	2417300	You still got him like, by the shirt collar.
2417300	2422300	Yeah, I'm holding him, I have him by the shirt collar, and I'm like, taking a defensive position.
2422300	2423300	Perfect.
2423300	2427300	John is pushing his turn, Jack Russell is dead, and the ball goes again.
2428300	2442300	Don, Keith, the two of you see the ball put its long, long limbs into this shining, shimmering, silver sea, and begin moving.
2442300	2452300	It drops the body of Jack Russell onto the boat right behind the little twins, still holding onto the body of Julie Maxwell,
2452300	2461300	but it moves and makes its way toward the John made hole in the side of the original piston bunker yard,
2461300	2471300	and John and Clark, you both see, just rising from below, right outside that John made hole,
2471300	2480300	a one inch in diameter, silver sphere pop up with the tendrils coming out below it and above it.
2480300	2483300	It's made its way to the John made hole.
2483300	2484300	Keith, your turn.
2484300	2486300	I stand up.
2486300	2488300	Fuck.
2488300	2492300	I look on the other side of the door to see what could have happened to this spider.
2492300	2497300	When you look on the other side of the door, you just see it's a hatch door, it's kind of made out of the same material,
2497300	2505300	but then you see through the door this entirely new world, the sky completely dark.
2505300	2511300	It's almost tension relieving when you look into it because it is just one thing.
2511300	2518300	When you look into the sky and you look at materials that are in this plane of existence where you are currently,
2518300	2523300	it wrinkles your brain, it like tenses your shoulders.
2523300	2527300	You haven't been able to really relax even though you feel completely content here.
2527300	2534300	There, on the other side, it is just darkness above and just light below.
2534300	2538300	I want to walk in looking straight above me like trying not to look at the ground at all
2538300	2545300	and trying to not have the ground in my eyesight at all, staring straight up and just walk in.
2545300	2557300	Past the ball and in the foreground of your view, Clark and Jon both see Keith in the background walking through the door.
2557300	2559300	Clark, it's your turn.
2559300	2567300	Clark is going to try and get low and put junk piles between him and the ball at the door.
2567300	2573300	Yes. Jon, his eyes get big as he sees the ball floating there.
2573300	2579300	He kicks himself for closing the portal in the first place and hastily tries to make it again.
2579300	2582300	43.
2582300	2591300	With his experienced hand, he opens the door into the ivory endlessness of the terrain in the other bunker.
2591300	2595300	They see Keith just in front of them walking into it.
2595300	2597300	Jon yells at Clark,
2597300	2600300	Come on, buddy. We got to get fucking through this portal.
2600300	2607300	And kind of assumes, I guess, that the ball will choose Leo instead of Clark.
2607300	2613300	He just grabs onto whatever part of Clark is closest to him and drags him through the portal with him.
2613300	2615300	Dope. Amazing.
2615300	2617300	All right, Don, your turn.
2617300	2621300	I see Keith walk away from me, right?
2621300	2623300	Yeah, Keith goes to the other side of the hatch.
2623300	2625300	Do I see, like, Jon coming through?
2625300	2632300	Yeah, when you turn and go around the hatch to your left immediately on the inside of this hatch door,
2632300	2638300	you see Jon dragging Clark through and they pass you as you're standing there.
2638300	2642300	They pass you and walk right behind Keith into this new world.
2642300	2647300	I think Don just slams the fucking door and turns to go with them.
2647300	2648300	Fuck yeah.
2648300	2655300	So you come through the door, slam the door behind you, and the four of you have entered a new world.
2655300	2657300	It is Jon's turn right behind you.
2657300	2661300	The inside of this hatch is still a portal to the world that you were just in.
2661300	2665300	Anybody forget anything? Car keys? Cell phones?
2665300	2667300	Leo!
2667300	2671300	No, no, no, no. No. God damn.
2671300	2674300	I promised him we wouldn't forget him.
2674300	2676300	Yeah!
2676300	2678300	You hear a violent cry.
2678300	2680300	We gotta help if we did this to him.
2680300	2684300	Did they forget the goat they fed to the Tyrannosaurus in Jurassic Park?
2684300	2686300	No, it played an important role.
2686300	2688300	And I'm gonna try to...
2688300	2690300	I'm gonna try to close that portal.
2690300	2692300	Forty-five.
2692300	2696300	I mean, yay!
2696300	2698300	No, that's rad.
2698300	2710300	The fact that Jon Lee Kevin Moore the Thirth is just so in tune with this ability makes so much sense.
2710300	2712300	Because you're home, baby.
2712300	2723300	Jon moves his experienced hands across this strange inky doorway, removes the portal, and the hatch dissipates into nothingness as well.
2723300	2727300	The ground you all stand on is made of light.
2727300	2732300	It's a soft glow that illuminates this new world from below.
2732300	2738300	In every direction surrounding you, what could be called the ground meets what could be called the sky.
2738300	2743300	And it's this blacker than black opaque darkness.
2743300	2752300	And there's nothing on the horizon except for a single imposing building way off in the distance.
2752300	2760300	Dimly lit from below, you can see that it's a slightly shiny pitch black.
2760300	2766300	But Keith doesn't notice that because Keith is staring straight up.
2766300	2776300	And each of you understand why he hasn't stopped staring when you follow his gaze up into a tube of pure light hanging above.
2776300	2784300	The interior wall of this incandescent pipe is made of the same light you currently stand on.
2784300	2791300	And there seems to be only complete darkness beyond its well-lit passage.
2791300	2799300	And there's something in this immense, resplendent cylinder, consistently plodding the glowing terrain,
2799300	2805300	somehow simultaneously moving toward you and staying at a uniform range.
2805300	2815300	It is a towering, lumbering beast, seemingly made of the darkness that surrounds everything in this place.
2815300	2820300	It walks on two massive legs the size of trees.
2820300	2826300	Its broad shoulders swing back and forth high above the glossy ground.
2826300	2835300	And as you all stare, its image seems to form and reform over and over like incomprehensible little glitches.
2835300	2841300	And you cannot fully make sense of its shape. And then it roars.
2846300	2854300	Every muscle in your body stiffens and every breath abandons your lungs.
2856300	2864300	Bad girls on top of the water
2864300	2868300	Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline
2868300	2872300	Leaving my mind at your altar
2872300	2876300	Crossing the double line, doing it every time
2876300	2882300	Tell me what kind of world are you living in?
2883300	2890300	What kind of world are you living in?
2890300	2894300	What kind of world are you living in?
2910300	2916300	What kind of world are you living in?
2916300	2924300	What kind of world are you living in?
