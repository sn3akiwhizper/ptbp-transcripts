0	9000	Hey folks, I'm Zach, the producer, whoever that asshole is, totally fucked up.
9000	21000	They forgot to remind Wolf the Dog that the Den of Sin will be live this upcoming Tuesday, the 28th of July, for an extremely special stream.
21000	24000	Luke is running a homebrew.
24000	35000	This is the first time any of these players have run a DG scenario, and I consider myself blessed as fuck to get to join the rank of the PCs for this one shot.
35000	48000	I have so much respect for Luke as a player, and so much love for this dude as a human, and I cannot wait to play in a game at which he is at the helm.
48000	63000	And for all of you at the Splashylvania Fastpass holders at the $5 and up level, I will have part 3, the conclusion of our playthrough of Lover in the Ice, edited and uploaded in this coming week.
63000	72000	So be on the lookout for that, and if you are not a patron of this fine podcast you've listened to a stupid amount of, don't worry.

95000	103000	Seriously, I did a quick skim, my fault, and I ended up running Lover in the Ice, my fault.
103000	106000	It did win the poll, that's why I ran it, my fault.

130000	143000	On a real human note, I seriously, I spend a dumb amount of time making this podcast, and I'm dumbfounded and humbled by the responses we've received.
143000	148000	When we were about to start, we talked about our pipe dreams for the show, right?
148000	159000	Mine was fan art. I said, if someone makes fan art for our show, this will all have been worth it, and holy shit, I had no idea what was coming.
159000	164000	You guys have made some of the dopest, ugh, it just, it's so heartening.
164000	171000	I had no idea how invested we'd all be in putting out this show every week for thousands of people.
171000	183000	That seems silly, even as I say it, but I just want you all to know, we really appreciate having you all along for this ride, this fucking wild-ass ride we're all on.

195000	206000	If you're dealing with instability right now due to COVID or being a poor college student, or legitimately just because capitalism fucking blows, do not worry. Fret not.
206000	213000	We completely understand. Keep listening to the show. Tell your friends about it. If you could, just blow up the internet.
213000	226000	Hit those RPG subreddits hard with recommendations. Tell your friends about the show. Just anything you can do helps, and it makes me smile, and it makes me hard.
227000	237000	I know Wolf has joked about taking other people's iPhones and reviewing our show on Apple Podcasts. That, that wasn't a joke.
237000	248000	That would help us tremendously. We really don't want to put ads on this show. We really like it the way it is, and we really hope you do too.
248000	255000	Fuck, I've been going on way too long. Let me send it over to my luff in the fog, Wolf the dog.
256000	264000	Aw yes, my children's children. It's good that you came to visit your old canine granddad, Wolf the dog.
264000	280000	Come sit on Pop Pop's lap while he regales you with the weird stuff that happened and will happen in this shithole of a town and multiple other realities, live from 694.2 PTBP.
280000	289000	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Roxy, who tagged that pretending part in an Instagram story. They write,
289000	301000	Greetings listeners of 694.2 PTBP in whatever you call the present, from about 25 episodes, I mean a few days in the past.
301000	313000	The opportunity arose to send this message to the future via radio broadcast technology operated by the exceptionally smooth radio presenter Wolf the dog.
313000	322000	So I decided to let my beloved Andy know that his cute little butt is the cutest in the whole universe. I mean universes.
322000	333000	Also, my contention uniform just arrived from the future, although I'm not sure what the meaning behind the pink square with skeletons dressed as the village people actually is.
334000	344000	Agent Roxy from the European Bureau of Chronologics in Athens, Greece. Oh Roxy, you know how to butter up a wolf's ears and soul, that's for sure.
344000	355000	But I will not accept you talking of others' meat buns on this here show. The only thick ham hawks I want people admiring are mine.
355000	364000	Damn, now I want to eat some hawks of ham. Time to fuse some clues. The truths get me loose like an amuse-bouche, it's the news.
364000	376000	Last time, Drew Carey, Pages, Andrews reunited with John before taking off on the four-wheeler with Agent Trent Catt and the odd-looking Broken Tubed Radio,
376000	385000	heading to Clinkers to find the hidden underground location of Gary, Harry, Mildred, Clara, and Drew's body.
385000	397000	The wall of water fell, crashing into and filling back up Bean's pond. Clark swam to safety, and John was lifted out of the water by a chanting and love.
397000	402000	The two of them then walked across the water to Clark on the shore.
402000	416000	Down in his secret underground laboratory, Keith Beans found the super unnaturally fucked up Tilly B. Mitchell behind the blast door, screeching and roaring like some sort of wild creature.
416000	428000	Falling back, he stumbled upon a hidden compartment in the uneven concrete floor, revealing an odd-looking old revolver with glass tubes and a green light lit.
428000	440000	Looking for other buried treasure, Keith found another small metal sphere, or ball, if you will. I'm honestly so shocked he didn't just grab this ball, y'all. I was so proud.
440000	451000	But then, this dumb motherfucker starts chanting the spell he remembered was on the paper that fell out of Mildred Mitchell's pocket when he straight up NFL blitzed this old-ass lady.
451000	461000	So Keith's body split open, discarding his metal bits before his human anatomy reformed inside and zipped itself back up.
461000	479000	And with that, Keith Vigna Beans lost his goddamn mind. He walked over to the strange, old-timey revolver, found a massive, dusty cartridge in the cylinder, and pulled the trigger, triggering a blinding flash of light.
479000	499000	Keith Beans came to the Old West. Contention in 1880-something. He saw the original Silas Cole walking down the dusty path towards town, chased him down, snapped his neck, and took his wrongful place as the founder of our beautiful, quiet little town here.
499000	511000	If you love contention, then this is your commission. The admission of our religion to all that we can condition, which consists of listening to Cuz You With No Backbone.
529000	547000	Alright, do you guys have anything interesting to say, or should we dive right into episode 88 of this podcast here that we make together?
547000	552000	If you put zeroes between the eights, it says boobs.
552000	558000	The wall of water and fish previously surrounding Beansburg.
558000	568000	You are just going to blast past Joe's amazing revelation like that, Zach?
568000	570000	I have never thought about it.
570000	573000	If you put zeroes in between it...
573000	577000	Hang on, let me pull up my calculator so I can show you.
577000	579000	Oh, he did it.
579000	589000	Well guys, if you guys don't, I'm gonna leave real quick, but I'll be back in five minutes?
589000	592000	Okay.
592000	595000	Is that because you were so turned on by the number boob?
595000	605000	If you think that's enough time to get your little dick done.
605000	613000	It's so small that it takes forever. This is great. This is grade A content.
613000	624000	I've idly wondered almost every time if showing you guys my dick would be a crime. Like, literally.
624000	629000	I think probably, which is why I haven't done it, but I'm surprised Luke has it.
629000	637000	Yeah, it's pretty wild. We're Luke-less right now, at the top of this episode here. Nope, we're not Luke-less.
637000	642000	I just don't want that I think about showing you guys my dick every episode part in...
642000	645000	Oh, too bad.
645000	648000	Okay.
648000	656000	I thought you were saying that we shouldn't say that Luke's not here, that way we could all react to him showing us his dick right now.
656000	658000	Wow!
658000	661000	It's weird.
661000	670000	The wall of water and fish previously surrounding Bean's pond has now filled up the entirety of the previously dehydrated bowl.
670000	681000	There's plenty of this water teeming with fish left over, and now the streets are gushing with a fair amount flowing down into the storm drains.
681000	685000	Clark, you were able to swim to the shallow shore safely.
685000	696000	John, your partially metal skeleton weighing you down combined with a failed swim check led to your needing to be saved by the very woman you claim to not trust at all.
696000	706000	Ann Love pulled you up out of the water, chanting, and she lifted you on top of the surface where the two of you walked, Jesus-style, over to Clark.
706000	713000	I need you both to roll Sanity for witnessing this unnatural ability.
713000	716000	Fail. 45 on a 20.
716000	719000	I also fail a 48 on a 9.
719000	721000	Go ahead and lose 1d4 Sanity.
721000	723000	Oh no. A 1.
723000	725000	Oh, nice.
725000	727000	Is it a 1 of those 1 plus?
727000	735000	It was not a 1d4 plus 1, because if you would have succeeded, you would have only lost a 0, and you would have gotten to roll another check that I would have asked for.
735000	743000	But since neither one of you did succeed, you both just lose 1d4, which for Clark was 1 Sanity, for John is 2 Sanity.
743000	747000	So I'm at 16. I was wrong. I was at 18, not 20.
747000	752000	Oh, even worse. Or better. Worse. Better? 1 or 2?
753000	755000	I never know.
755000	757000	Can I see 3 again?
757000	763000	And Anne kind of walks you over to- that was so stupid. Anne walks you over to-
763000	768000	I just had an eye appointment the other day, so it's on my mind.
768000	784000	And she looks into both of your eyes. She's just cackling with laughter as she realizes how freaked the fuck out both of you are that-
784000	788000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, right? I can do that.
788000	791000	You made him walk on water. He was walking on water.
791000	797000	I mean, it was mostly me, but, you know, I can let him, if you will. And I will.
797000	799000	Can you show us how to let people?
799000	800000	Sure.
800000	803000	Oh, shit. Do you guys want to get into this?
803000	806000	Yeah. Yeah, sure.
806000	810000	If it allows us to walk on water, that seems helpful.
810000	817000	Yeah, I mean, no. This spell is good for anything. You can walk on water, you can put people into walls. Like, you can do all sorts of stuff. It's so dope.
817000	819000	Could you put yourself on the other side of a door?
819000	824000	Clark's heart sinks when she mentions the put people into walls thing.
825000	826000	His face falls.
826000	828000	Clark did what?
828000	830000	I don't want to learn it. I don't want to learn it.
830000	834000	Yeah, I guess you could walk through doors, for sure.
834000	836000	What's it called?
836000	846000	For the first time, you probably won't be able to just say it. You'll need to, like, read it off a paper. So, do any of you have- Oh, everything's all wet.
846000	851000	I guess we'd need to find something to write it on first off.
851000	853000	I'd like to search the area for-
853000	855000	Yeah, I think that's a good call.
855000	856000	Ready, utensils?
856000	858000	Go ahead and roll search.
858000	861000	I got a 73 on a 50.
861000	871000	Well, I mean, just like I did- Okay, so, we can figure this out later, but why do you want to be able to walk through a door? Is the book on the other side of a door?
871000	873000	Maybe, actually.
873000	877000	Wait, for real? Do you know where the book is?
877000	885000	Hold on, man. I've got to take this.
885000	893000	He's just going to- He didn't take the call. He just told me he's going to take it. Now he's just texting?
893000	895000	Continue.
895000	900000	We're talking about the book that you killed my parents for, is that right?
900000	901000	Yeah.
901000	904000	What made you decide to come and get it now? They've been dead for years.
904000	916000	Well, it's kind of the end, if you will, if we don't solve it. And I personally, and Maggie as well, of course, really thinks that the book could solve it.
916000	922000	And if not, we're banking on this other guy to take care of things if he shows up.
922000	923000	Who's that?
923000	927000	The Overseer. It'd be really cool if the Overseer showed up, but-
927000	931000	I elbow Clark really hard in the ribs.
931000	939000	Oh, yeah. Hey, we don't know who that would be, right?
939000	941000	Right. That's right.
941000	948000	Because we don't want to just go blabbing out. What is the Overseer supposed to do?
948000	955000	It's not really known too much, but basically like the revelation of the Overseer was that Jim was going to die.
955000	961000	And now that he's dead, it kind of seems like it is only through death that he may live.
961000	969000	And so this guy is this like rogue dude with, he's got some sort of light in his mouth or something like that.
969000	979000	And I don't know how, I don't know how, but when you look at it, you could just feel the power, right?
979000	983000	And it's this idea that like he started the circle of knowledge.
983000	987000	And so therefore at the end, you know, he'll be able to come back and save us.
987000	989000	And you haven't seen him.
989000	992000	No, God, no. Wait, have you?
992000	996000	No. Clark looks at his feet.
996000	1002000	Roll. Persuade.
1002000	1008000	I pass. Yes, I pass. A 40 on a 40. That passes, right? You can meet it?
1008000	1011000	It does indeed. It was a contested roll.
1011000	1013000	Oh, so I kicked ass, right?
1013000	1019000	Oh, okay. Yeah, no, none of us have seen it. I mean, that would be wild.
1019000	1030000	And, you know, there's this overseer thing. There's the beans thing on the door.
1030000	1039000	You're not aware of like a third thing, like a third prophecy or thing and a third special thing for another special person who might.
1039000	1044000	Nope. Probably no other special people.
1044000	1047000	Right, right. Probably not. Yeah.
1047000	1048000	Who are you thinking of?
1048000	1051000	No, nobody. Nobody in particular.
1051000	1053000	Like me?
1053000	1059000	I guess it could be anybody.
1059000	1064000	But yeah, if you guys need to get through a door to find the book, then we can make that happen.
1064000	1067000	Oh, yeah, our friend Keith had the book.
1067000	1071000	Roll Persuade, because add a negative 20, please.
1071000	1075000	You don't need to apply the negative modifier.
1075000	1077000	Because I already failed.
1077000	1080000	Why are you okay?
1080000	1083000	He didn't have the book. I lied.
1083000	1086000	Did you just want me to take you to a...
1086000	1092000	Yeah, if you could magic us through the door, we really miss our friend Keith, and he would really come in handy at calm, comfy campgrounds.
1092000	1096000	The little fellow who went through with the guy with the helmet on his head?
1096000	1099000	I know. I know he doesn't look like much, but he's scrappy.
1099000	1104000	Not to mention whatever's down there seemed important to that guy and might help us in our journey.
1104000	1108000	That guy with the helmet would almost certainly know where the book is.
1108000	1109000	How?
1109000	1112000	He's just really familiar with all of this shit.
1112000	1114000	Kind of like you. He just knows the whole hell.
1114000	1118000	You guys should probably have a beer or something, maybe, and talk about this all.
1118000	1121000	He's real dangerous, too. He was the one doing all the fish magic.
1121000	1128000	And he wants to kill a bunch of people to go back in time and stop all of this, which might put a kibosh on whatever you're working on.
1128000	1133000	He was trying to go back in time to do what?
1133000	1137000	I don't rightly know. Become Silas Cole or something?
1137000	1140000	Huh. Hey, John, right?
1140000	1141000	Ann.
1141000	1143000	Yeah, did you use the radio?
1143000	1144000	Today.
1144000	1146000	Ever?
1146000	1148000	Ann, I don't rightly remember.
1153000	1155000	I've been a lot of things in the past few days.
1155000	1157000	What do you mean by that?
1157000	1161000	He just kind of points at his Kevin face.
1161000	1164000	Right, right. So you weren't always...
1164000	1165000	No, ma'am.
1165000	1169000	Okay. Quick question, then. Who the fuck are you?
1169000	1173000	And why were you acting like you were my partner? I...
1173000	1175000	Ann, I'm your son.
1180000	1183000	I don't see how that would remotely be possible.
1184000	1189000	Well, it was kind of a big leap, but I am Kevin's son.
1190000	1194000	Wait, so you're not the Kevin that I knew at all.
1194000	1197000	You're just the body, but you didn't use the radio?
1197000	1200000	Oh, no. I'm ball.
1200000	1202000	It's this whole other deal.
1203000	1206000	Clark's eyes are wide, staring at John.
1206000	1210000	Yeah, this is... I forgot I was deceiving you.
1212000	1214000	Role-playing, baby.
1215000	1218000	And by your ball, you mean...
1218000	1221000	My conscience is contained in a small metal sphere...
1221000	1223000	Yeah, a vector.
1223000	1225000	...which rips out a vector.
1225000	1228000	Well, you are the ve... So you're one of...
1228000	1231000	Are you telling me there is a special thing for me?
1233000	1236000	Yeah, I guess there is.
1236000	1239000	Clark's hand is going to his pistol. Does she look scary?
1239000	1241000	Roll humant.
1244000	1247000	I fail. A 46 on a 30.
1248000	1251000	She looks the same as she did 30 seconds ago.
1251000	1253000	She looks the exact same.
1254000	1258000	She's not, like, making a move of aggression of any kind.
1258000	1261000	Okay. Well, that's wild.
1261000	1263000	Okay, what do you remember?
1263000	1265000	Sorry, I've never talked to one.
1265000	1267000	Do you mean about, like, the process or...
1267000	1270000	Well, yeah, like, do you have human con...
1270000	1272000	Like, do you think you're human?
1273000	1275000	And she looks at Clark and she goes,
1275000	1278000	Oh, my God, he thinks he's human.
1279000	1281000	John puts his hand on his gun.
1281000	1283000	He's human. Look at him.
1283000	1285000	He's been with us the whole way along.
1285000	1287000	He just looks a little different now, that's all.
1287000	1290000	Wait, so you're, like, all done up, all metal-like, right?
1290000	1292000	Like, I can kind of see...
1292000	1295000	Is that... Was that already in, Kevin?
1295000	1297000	Or is that part of you?
1297000	1299000	Does your skeleton grow out?
1299000	1301000	Like, does the ball make a skeleton for you?
1301000	1302000	It's all part of me.
1302000	1304000	Calm down. Calm down.
1304000	1307000	You look a little upset. I'm not upset.
1307000	1309000	I'm very curious.
1309000	1311000	Curious as hell. You are special.
1311000	1313000	You're extremely special. You wanted to be special.
1313000	1314000	You're damn special.
1314000	1316000	You said you never talked to him,
1316000	1318000	but that presupposes that you've run into him before.
1318000	1319000	What do you know about him?
1319000	1321000	Yeah, I was sent here to take care of him.
1321000	1323000	That's why me and Kevin were...
1323000	1326000	And Kyle were sent here by Jim
1326000	1329000	to get rid of these balls.
1329000	1332000	He didn't tell you why or what they were or what they could do?
1332000	1336000	They were being put in babies?
1336000	1339000	So there was this place called Cole's Orphanage
1339000	1342000	that we had to completely get rid of, wipe out,
1342000	1346000	take off any trace that had ever existed, anything like that,
1346000	1348000	because, I mean, it was...
1348000	1350000	It was a big issue, right?
1350000	1352000	Because these people, they were adopting children,
1352000	1354000	but they weren't fucking human.
1354000	1358000	And that's what we were trying to stop from happening, right?
1358000	1360000	And so we were just trying to get rid of them,
1360000	1364000	but the only thing that Jim said was, don't touch them.
1364000	1366000	So we didn't.
1366000	1368000	So in your experience, how did you take care of them
1368000	1370000	if you couldn't touch them?
1370000	1374000	There's a certain way that I can handle things.
1374000	1377000	It doesn't involve a bag of any kind, right?
1377000	1379000	A bag? What kind of bag? Why'd you ask that?
1379000	1382000	Just a thing that we've heard might work, but yeah.
1382000	1385000	You, uh, what, do you use your magic?
1385000	1386000	Yeah, in a way.
1386000	1389000	So you were just out there killing babies.
1389000	1391000	What?
1393000	1397000	Yeah, I guess me and your dad were out there killing babies,
1397000	1399000	if you really want to think about it,
1399000	1402000	whether or not he's actually your dad, but...
1402000	1403000	Holy shit.
1403000	1405000	They weren't babies, though.
1405000	1406000	Yes, they were.
1406000	1409000	No offense, no offense. It's fine, it's fine.
1409000	1411000	I'm clearly impressed,
1411000	1414000	but they needed to be taken care of at the time.
1414000	1416000	And I know one thing.
1418000	1421000	I'm more human than you will ever be.
1428000	1429000	Okay.
1429000	1431000	Well, shall we go?
1431000	1433000	Let's go to the church, Clark.
1433000	1436000	Yeah, and I don't know about this anymore.
1436000	1438000	Her eyes narrow.
1439000	1440000	Huh.
1440000	1441000	Okay.
1442000	1444000	What are you gonna do about it?
1444000	1445000	We don't know, man.
1445000	1447000	What's your end goal, then?
1447000	1448000	What's your end goal?
1448000	1450000	If we went and got that book,
1450000	1453000	ended up at Calm Comfy Campground, what happens?
1453000	1455000	Okay, well, like, best case...
1455000	1458000	Like, best case scenario, based on what Maggie said,
1458000	1460000	if we could actually get the book,
1460000	1465000	then we would be able to either call for the Overseer,
1465000	1468000	because we don't know whether he's actually gonna show up or not, you know?
1468000	1471000	Like, it's not a determined thing ahead of time,
1471000	1476000	but she thinks that we could summon him
1476000	1481000	in order to save the world.
1481000	1485000	I'm sorry, but doesn't the creator of your organization
1485000	1487000	showing up at the end of all things
1487000	1489000	to, like, tie it all up in a neat little bow
1489000	1492000	just seem a little too fairytale?
1494000	1497000	I don't think that he's who you think he is
1497000	1499000	if you think it's a fairytale.
1503000	1507000	No, he does not strike me as a Prince Charming.
1507000	1508000	No.
1508000	1510000	No, King, perhaps, but not a...
1510000	1512000	No, not a good one.
1512000	1514000	I mean, most of those fairytales
1514000	1516000	aren't really about good people either,
1516000	1519000	but don't you think it's still pretty convenient for yourself
1519000	1522000	that you'd just be able to summon this guy
1522000	1523000	and he'd end it for you?
1523000	1525000	Yeah.
1525000	1526000	What do you want to do?
1526000	1528000	I've been talking a lot. What is your guys' plan?
1528000	1531000	If I wasn't here, what would you guys have done,
1531000	1533000	besides, you know, your friend dying?
1533000	1536000	We'd probably wander around
1536000	1538000	trying to gather more information
1538000	1541000	until it was too late and everything exploded.
1546000	1547000	That's...
1547000	1548000	That's...
1556000	1559000	You're more than welcome to do that if you want to,
1559000	1563000	but based on our whole conversation that we've been having here,
1563000	1566000	it seems like you want to get down into the bottom of the pond
1566000	1568000	through that door to meet up with your friend.
1568000	1571000	And if that's right, if you take me and show me the book,
1571000	1574000	because I saw that weird face you made earlier,
1574000	1576000	I think you might have an idea of where it is.
1576000	1580000	If you can show me the book, I will get you through the door.
1582000	1584000	Can I have a moment to speak with my associate?
1584000	1585000	Sure.
1585000	1587000	Clark, she walks away with her back turned toward you.
1587000	1590000	John, do you know where the book is that she's talking about?
1590000	1592000	I don't know where the book is.
1592000	1593000	She thinks it's at my house,
1593000	1595000	but I mean, I've lived there for my whole life.
1595000	1597000	I've never seen a book there that...
1597000	1600000	I thought I had told you.
1600000	1603000	Maybe I had my mind as a jumble,
1603000	1609000	but yeah, I had a vision of Kacelle going to your parents' house,
1609000	1615000	and Kevin found the book and didn't tell the others.
1615000	1617000	I don't know what he did with it.
1617000	1619000	She did tell us that Jim tried to make his own book
1619000	1622000	when he couldn't find the one your parents had.
1622000	1623000	Right.
1623000	1626000	So then, yeah, her guess is as good as ours.
1626000	1627000	It could be at my house.
1627000	1629000	I didn't ever see a book up there.
1629000	1632000	I mean, I wasn't lying when I was telling her
1632000	1634000	that Adam Kane might be the person who knows the most
1634000	1636000	about where that book might be.
1636000	1640000	He seems to have been amassing a lot of supernatural bullshit
1640000	1642000	underneath our noses this whole time.
1642000	1645000	He certainly mastered the object, it seems like.
1645000	1647000	He knew about them and how to work them.
1647000	1650000	Yeah, I mean, when I saw that squirrel with the radio,
1650000	1651000	I was like, I don't...
1651000	1653000	Or the cat, rather.
1653000	1657000	Squirrels and cats.
1657000	1660000	I was like, I don't even remember what that thing does.
1660000	1665000	So kudos to Adam Kane.
1665000	1667000	The radio was the one that switched bodies.
1667000	1671000	I wasn't sure what the helmet did until now I've got a hunch
1671000	1673000	after seeing the things we did.
1673000	1674000	What do you think the helmet does?
1674000	1675000	It makes us see things.
1675000	1676000	It's gotta be.
1676000	1679000	I tell you, moments ago, I was bashing in the windows
1679000	1682000	of the van that was on fire, and then it disappeared.
1682000	1683000	It wasn't there.
1683000	1687000	Hey, hey, you know, you just gotta let that go.
1687000	1688000	I just...
1688000	1689000	So does Adam.
1689000	1692000	We're going to say that to him, and if he doesn't,
1692000	1696000	then we'll move on from there.
1696000	1700000	Get over it, Adam.
1700000	1703000	I don't know what to do, John.
1703000	1705000	We could maybe find the book with her
1705000	1709000	and then jump her and take it.
1709000	1710000	I mean, what if she's right?
1710000	1711000	What if the whole thing is right?
1711000	1714000	What if using the book that she finds calls what we think
1714000	1718000	is maybe hold me down, and he's willing to help us
1718000	1720000	because it's me?
1720000	1722000	Old G's been a little weird around us, though.
1722000	1723000	I mean, not exactly.
1723000	1728000	Not forthcoming, for sure, but he does seem to be helping.
1728000	1730000	Oh, shit.
1730000	1735000	Okay, Clark, what if you write a letter to yourself
1735000	1738000	to open in the future saying like,
1738000	1741000	hey, come back right now to this moment?
1741000	1742000	Yeah.
1742000	1743000	That'd be cool.
1743000	1744000	Yeah.
1744000	1746000	We were looking for paper moments ago, though,
1746000	1748000	and we didn't find any.
1748000	1750000	We'll really have to keep an eye on now.
1750000	1754000	Also, things got real tense with Ann,
1754000	1757000	and she's probably not going to teach us magic anymore.
1757000	1760000	You guys should roll alertness for me.
1760000	1763000	She's gone.
1763000	1765000	Wait, what is my alertness?
1765000	1766000	Damn it.
1766000	1767000	80 on a 60.
1767000	1768000	Ah, fuck.
1768000	1770000	A 76 on a 70.
1770000	1773000	She's just been in the circle with us this whole time.
1773000	1774000	No, you guys are good.
1774000	1776000	You can keep talking.
1776000	1779000	I'm getting a weird feeling about Ann.
1779000	1782000	Let's check in on her.
1782000	1783000	Ann?
1783000	1789000	As you say, I'm getting a weird feeling about Ann.
1789000	1793000	You hear the chanting that has been happening behind your back
1793000	1797000	this entire time that is growing louder and louder.
1797000	1805000	It's Stefani Nazifalo.
1805000	1807000	Gwen Stefani.
1807000	1812000	And she has a large knife,
1812000	1816000	and she is holding it over her head,
1816000	1822000	and she is coming down at John Lee Pettymore, the third skull.
1822000	1824000	Because she's getting the jump on you,
1824000	1826000	you're going to be at a negative 40.
1826000	1829000	And I'm sorry about that.
1829000	1832000	She passed with a 30.
1832000	1834000	My eyes grow wide, and I scream,
1834000	1835000	she's coming for my ball!
1835000	1839000	And I try to artfully roll out of the way using athletics.
1839000	1843000	Wait, I'm at, oh fuck, I'm at minus 40?
1843000	1845000	Yeah, what's your athletics?
1845000	1849000	I try to persuade her to stop.
1849000	1851000	What's your athletics?
1851000	1855000	I'm just trying to find anything else I could use.
1855000	1858000	Oh, I'd like to use my robot constitution
1858000	1862000	and my metal plates to just take the fucking blow.
1862000	1865000	Alright, athletics, 50 at a minus 40.
1865000	1867000	Okay, so you have to roll an ought one
1867000	1870000	in order to win the contest.
1870000	1872000	I rolled a 73.
1872000	1873000	Well, that was really close.
1873000	1876000	It was as close as any other number would have been
1876000	1878000	to what you were looking for.
1878000	1881000	And, Clark Bishop, think about what you're doing
1881000	1887000	as she is going to stab down.
1887000	1891000	This knife goes directly into the top of your head, John Lee,
1891000	1897000	and you feel your skull crack as you take nine damage,
1897000	1901000	and blood begins to just gush out of the hole.
1901000	1903000	How much, wait, how many hit points did you have?
1903000	1904000	I had 20.
1904000	1906000	Okay.
1906000	1908000	Good, I just realized that, not good,
1908000	1910000	whatever it would have been,
1910000	1912000	but I just realized that we had a whole gunfight earlier
1912000	1916000	that might have been an issue with nine hit points.
1916000	1920000	So you're down to 11, and blood is just like gushing out,
1920000	1923000	and Clark Bishop, blood is spurting out
1923000	1925000	of John Lee Pettymore III's head.
1925000	1927000	Clay!
1930000	1933000	And, what the fuck, and I want to tackle her.
1933000	1934000	Get her to the ground?
1934000	1936000	Yeah, that'll be unarmed combat, and she'll be at a negative
1936000	1938000	since she already attacked this turn.
1938000	1942000	Okay.
1942000	1943000	A 46.
1943000	1944000	She passes 43.
1944000	1946000	I pass 46.
1946000	1948000	How do you want to take her to the ground?
1948000	1949000	As soon as she...
1949000	1951000	It's not that kind of podcast, Joe.
1951000	1952000	Calm down.
1952000	1954000	And she's not into that.
1954000	1956000	I get her center mass and get her to the ground,
1956000	1959000	and I want to put an arm across her throat
1959000	1961000	so if she does try to start chanting again, she can't.
1961000	1963000	Ooh, nice.
1963000	1965000	I'm pressing into her throat.
1965000	1966000	Does that end the combat?
1966000	1968000	Do I need to talk to her now?
1968000	1970000	No, it does not end the combat at all.
1970000	1972000	John Lee Pettymore, it's your turn.
1972000	1974000	You've got a large knife.
1974000	1977000	I'd say yay long, about a foot long,
1977000	1981000	and a good three inches of it are in you.
1981000	1985000	I need you to tell me how three inches of knife
1985000	1988000	being in my skull affects my mind brain.
1988000	1990000	Yeah, no, I'm a scientist.
1990000	1993000	Or does it at all since it didn't hit ball?
1993000	1996000	Yeah, I mean, we're at the point now where, you know,
1996000	2001000	ball controls everything, so your brain is only there
2001000	2005000	as a human function to...
2005000	2008000	Maybe it's grabbed onto your brain
2008000	2012000	to try to emulate empathy and emotion of some sort,
2012000	2014000	or maybe that was in ball all along.
2014000	2017000	You don't really know, but you know that in this moment,
2017000	2021000	you can't really see straight because everything's wobbly,
2021000	2025000	and you feel like you're gonna throw up,
2025000	2029000	but you are not at a mechanical disadvantage currently
2029000	2031000	for some reason.
2031000	2033000	It might be because you're metal.
2033000	2036000	Ah, fuck, let's see.
2036000	2040000	John takes the pistol given to him by Harry,
2040000	2042000	and although he's wobbly,
2042000	2046000	he plants himself with his robot feet
2047000	2049000	and sort of steadies himself
2049000	2052000	and brings his arm up and shoots it in.
2052000	2054000	32 on a 60.
2054000	2056000	Roll a D10 for damage.
2058000	2059000	Ten.
2059000	2060000	Fuck.
2060000	2061000	Whew!
2061000	2062000	Where do you shoot her?
2062000	2064000	Clark knocked her to the ground.
2064000	2066000	Yeah, he's like on top of her.
2066000	2070000	Then I'm sorry, Anne, but I shoot you in the knee.
2070000	2072000	As you blast through her knee,
2073000	2078000	you see the entire calf just kind of like twitch and shake
2078000	2080000	off kilter from where it's supposed to be.
2080000	2084000	Her leg now goes down and then off out to the side
2084000	2086000	as it kind of blasts those ligaments off
2086000	2088000	that keep it where it's supposed to be.
2088000	2089000	Oh, my God.
2089000	2091000	And it hits an artery,
2091000	2096000	and blood is just pouring out of her leg.
2096000	2097000	Oh, no.
2097000	2099000	And it's Anne Love's turn,
2099000	2101000	and I've got Ramona on the desk.
2102000	2103000	Hi, Ramona.
2103000	2105000	Ramona, save us.
2105000	2108000	Ramona, will you get down or get in my lap or something?
2108000	2109000	Come here.
2109000	2110000	There she is.
2110000	2111000	All right.
2111000	2112000	She's going to grapple with your arm,
2112000	2115000	and as she's doing it, she is trying to chant
2118000	2120000	and roll unarmed combat.
2124000	2125000	She passed with a 25.
2125000	2127000	I passed with a 37.
2127000	2129000	You motherfucker.
2130000	2131000	Fuck yes, Joe.
2135000	2137000	And it's Clark Bishop's turn.
2138000	2139000	Oh, shit.
2139000	2140000	Okay.
2140000	2141000	Oh, boy.
2141000	2145000	I want to grab the wound behind me
2145000	2147000	that has now been inflicted.
2147000	2150000	I'm trying to cause so much pain that she passes out.
2150000	2151000	Holy shit.
2151000	2155000	Okay, roll first aid against her constitution.
2155000	2156000	Holy shit.
2160000	2162000	He really is a game master.
2164000	2166000	She passes with a 17.
2166000	2168000	I fail a 95 on a 30.
2168000	2174000	Okay, so you describe this nastiness, please.
2177000	2178000	You did this.
2178000	2181000	Clark felt the spray of blood across his back
2181000	2184000	and knew that there was a wound back there,
2184000	2187000	so he reached behind him blindly to grab it,
2187000	2190000	and he wanted to clamp down as hard as he could
2190000	2192000	just to inflict pain.
2192000	2193000	That was his only goal.
2193000	2195000	She screams out,
2195000	2198000	but she clenches down on her teeth so hard
2198000	2202000	that as you're looking right into her mouth,
2202000	2203000	she's...
2204000	2206000	One of her teeth breaks.
2206000	2207000	Oh, my God.
2209000	2211000	And she spits it at you.
2212000	2215000	Okay, this is beautiful justice for Clark.
2215000	2216000	I just want to remind the audience
2216000	2219000	that this would feel real good for Clark.
2219000	2221000	I don't feel great about it as Joe.
2223000	2225000	But this woman killed his parents.
2229000	2231000	John Lee Pettymore, what's your excuse?
2233000	2235000	Oh, she said you weren't human.
2237000	2239000	Yeah, I am human. I'll show her.
2239000	2241000	All right, Knifehead, you're up.
2241000	2243000	John Lee Pettymore walks up and shoots her in the head.
2244000	2246000	You're going to take that away from Clark?
2247000	2248000	Roll firearms.
2248000	2250000	He was talking himself out of it.
2257000	2259000	Now she's pinned down on the ground, right?
2259000	2261000	Yeah, what'd you roll?
2261000	2263000	Let's say I rolled a 98.
2265000	2266000	Not a critical failure, but...
2266000	2267000	Not a critical failure.
2267000	2269000	With a 98, you walk up.
2269000	2271000	She looks at you through gritted teeth
2271000	2273000	and one of the teeth is chipped off and missing
2273000	2275000	and then she's gritting.
2275000	2278000	Another part of her tooth just cracks off
2278000	2282000	and you watch the enamel flake off of the other teeth
2282000	2284000	like peeling of an onion.
2284000	2285000	God damn it.
2286000	2288000	Just enough so that she can get this out
2288000	2289000	so you fucking know.
2289000	2290000	She says,
2292000	2293000	non-human.
2295000	2296000	Non-human.
2296000	2297000	You bastard.
2297000	2298000	You bastard.
2299000	2302000	John winces as a piece of enamel hits him in the eye.
2304000	2306000	And he sighs and he shakes his head and he says,
2306000	2308000	all cops are bastards.
2308000	2310000	And he pulls the trigger.
2313000	2315000	And it clicks and you're out of ammo.
2318000	2319000	Fuck!
2320000	2322000	Holy shit.
2323000	2325000	Clark, roll unarmed combat.
2325000	2327000	She's gonna try to throw you off.
2330000	2331000	She crit succeeds.
2331000	2332000	Oh my god.
2332000	2333000	And I failed.
2333000	2334000	Just a regular fail.
2334000	2336000	An 81 on a 70.
2336000	2337000	55.
2337000	2339000	She throws you off.
2342000	2344000	And immediately begins chanting.
2344000	2348000	I'm going to spend luck for Anne Love
2348000	2352000	to take another turn and she continues chanting.
2356000	2359000	John T. Fella!
2359000	2361000	John T. Fella!
2362000	2365000	I've got to grab some new headphones real quick.
2365000	2367000	These are cutting in and out.
2367000	2370000	I thought you were going to say that I just broke them.
2373000	2376000	That's just what John says and he dips.
2377000	2378000	She's like, yeah, no.
2378000	2379000	No big.
2379000	2380000	Tell Murphy hi.
2381000	2383000	Say hello to Murphy for me.
2385000	2389000	Oh, this is not going how I planned it all either.
2389000	2392000	Going into this, it was a debate about how we were going to,
2392000	2394000	which place we were going to go.
2395000	2396000	That wasn't.
2396000	2397000	That's what I thought too.
2399000	2401000	I prepped a couple different options.
2401000	2404000	Just like, I don't fucking know where they're going to go.
2405000	2410000	John Lee Pettymore the 3rd, as she is chanting,
2411000	2416000	you feel the blade on top of your head
2416000	2421000	slowly sinking deeper into your skull.
2423000	2427000	Now, it says here that it's 2D10.
2427000	2428000	Oh shit.
2430000	2434000	This knife does 2D10 damage when it has the spell being cast on it.
2434000	2436000	So I'm going to show you the roll.
2436000	2439000	He is moving his camera down so we can get a better view of the desk.
2441000	2442000	Is it 28?
2443000	2444000	So 8, 9, 10, right?
2444000	2445000	Yep, 10.
2445000	2447000	That puts me at 1.
2450000	2451000	Jesus Christ.
2453000	2454000	He's holding on.
2454000	2459000	Very importantly, you have to roll a constitution check here to stay conscious.
2459000	2464000	Okay, because of his robot bones, he gets a plus 10, which puts him at 70.
2465000	2466000	Fuck.
2466000	2467000	Fuck.
2469000	2471000	It's a fuck because he dropped the dice.
2472000	2475000	Alright, do you want me to tell you what it says on the floor or can I re-roll it?
2476000	2477000	The way you said that.
2482000	2483000	Thomas?
2483000	2485000	Is a floor dice a cock dice?
2485000	2490000	Do you remember every single time we rolled off the table when we used to play in the same room?
2491000	2492000	What was the rule?
2492000	2493000	Call it from the floor.
2493000	2494000	No.
2494000	2496000	If one falls off, you re-roll both.
2496000	2497000	Oh, awesome.
2497000	2498000	Okay.
2499000	2500000	Man.
2501000	2502000	So I didn't just roll a 94.
2503000	2504000	Thomas, there's a bug on you.
2504000	2505000	I rolled a 64.
2505000	2507000	Do you think you got a fly up by your collar?
2507000	2509000	No, it's this firefly.
2509000	2511000	It might be the same one I saw last night.
2511000	2513000	It's like really old.
2513000	2514000	How do you know?
2514000	2515000	It's gray.
2516000	2517000	Kind of, yeah.
2517000	2518000	It's wizened.
2518000	2519000	Or it's really sick.
2519000	2520000	It's a wizened firefly.
2520000	2521000	But it looks wizened.
2522000	2526000	It's like little chips of color have been flaked off its shell and shit.
2526000	2527000	Oh, that's sad.
2527000	2528000	What'd you roll?
2528000	2529000	A 64 on a 70.
2529000	2530000	Oh, yeah.
2531000	2533000	You're going to be able to stay conscious, but you feel...
2538000	2544000	Yeah, and for some reason in the back of your throat, it's like a phantom sensation.
2544000	2550000	Like the knife is all the way down inside your throat, even though you know that would
2550000	2555000	be like wild if that was true, but it like hurts as you scream.
2555000	2558000	We need an ultra violence tag for this episode.
2560000	2565000	And as you scream, Clark is looking at you and he sees a shimmer in the back of your mouth.
2566000	2567000	Oh my God.
2569000	2570000	Maybe I'm the overseer.
2570000	2574000	Maybe you've got one hit point.
2574000	2576000	Clark Bishop, it's your turn.
2577000	2580000	I want to try and shoot her to make her stop chanting.
2580000	2581000	Roll firearms.
2586000	2588000	Oh my God.
2589000	2591000	It's a 99.
2592000	2593000	Oh, that's good.
2593000	2594000	That's really good.
2595000	2599000	I told you not to roll so much before the episode, Joe.
2603000	2604000	Oh no.
2605000	2607000	Clark, you're so freaked out by...
2608000	2615000	You look back at John Lee Bettymore and you see this shimmering as the knife is just literally
2615000	2620000	moving further and further into his skull without anyone touching it.
2620000	2625000	And then as he's screaming, you see it in the back of his mouth.
2625000	2628000	And as you go to fire the gun.
2628000	2631000	Yeah, just fumble it out of the holster so terribly wrong.
2631000	2635000	And it lands directly in between you and Anne Love.
2636000	2638000	John Lee Pettymore with one hit point left.
2638000	2645000	Blood dripping down as if your head is a chocolate fountain.
2646000	2651000	Blood is covering everything, including all over your eyes.
2651000	2655000	So you're going to be at a negative 20 for any action you take that requires sight.
2655000	2656000	Where was Anne Love?
2656000	2660000	Is she still just on the ground in front of me?
2660000	2665000	No, she's standing and I'm picturing she's like backed up to the pond, essentially.
2665000	2670000	You're all just standing in murky, muddy water, splashing about.
2670000	2675000	So the gun just fell to the point to where you can't see it in this murky, muddy water
2675000	2679000	because there's enough water covering the grass in this area that it is even spilled
2679000	2682000	over in the streets behind you.
2682000	2685000	So she's just like at the edge of Bean's Pond.
2685000	2688000	The overfull Bean's Pond.
2688000	2692000	Yeah, I just want to try to reach out and crush her with my robot hands.
2692000	2695000	Like, crush her skull.
2696000	2700000	You can run up to her and try to attack her with your hands.
2700000	2705000	She passes a 14 and he's shaking his head no.
2705000	2707000	89.
2707000	2709000	Oh no!
2709000	2715000	I'm like blind with blood, so I just imagine myself just like stumbling straight forward
2715000	2716000	and falling into the muck.
2716000	2722000	And she kind of, as you're falling forward, she puts her foot out and kicks the top of
2723000	2728000	your head so that the top of the knife goes straight into the ground and just...
2729000	2737000	And the body of John Lee Pettymore lies flaccid face down in muddy water.
2737000	2740000	I'll see you guys next time, Loop.
2744000	2746000	Bye, Thomas!
2746000	2748000	Bye, guys.
2749000	2754000	Do I need to be on call at all this evening or is that pretty much it for...
2754000	2757000	Well, hold on, Joe. Take off your headphones.
2757000	2758000	I'm off.
2758000	2761000	Hey, how much luck do you have?
2761000	2762000	25.
2762000	2763000	Fuck.
2763000	2765000	I need 30, right?
2765000	2766000	You need 30.
2766000	2767000	God damn it.
2767000	2770000	I was going to have... The ball could have popped out and I was going to have you control it.
2770000	2774000	Oh, I could... How much is it to avoid major damage?
2774000	2779000	Oh, yeah. You should have done that earlier, but you can do it on this one.
2779000	2781000	I'll do it on this one.
2781000	2782000	Okay. Sounds good.
2782000	2783000	Okay.
2783000	2788000	So that one only did one hit point of damage, so you get to keep your one hit point.
2788000	2794000	It hits on a rock coming out of my chin and can't go all the way through.
2794000	2803000	Yeah, there's a rock floating along in the water that gets stuck right above your chest on your throat
2803000	2810000	and so as it dinks in, it just right into the rock instead of all the way through, finishing you off.
2810000	2814000	And you're still going to lay flaccid there and you're just going to stay on the call
2814000	2818000	and we'll let Joe think whatever he wants to think, but you're going to lose 10 luck.
2818000	2821000	I would suggest spending the other 15 during this.
2821000	2823000	Can you show me the luck chart real quick?
2823000	2831000	What you can do now is you can avoid unconsciousness for one point per round, but it doubles each round.
2831000	2833000	So one luck the first round, two, right?
2833000	2835000	Yeah. And then four and then eight.
2835000	2839000	And then after that, there's just adjusting any rolls.
2839000	2842000	You can adjust one to one.
2842000	2843000	For...
2843000	2844000	Like if you rolled it...
2844000	2845000	So up or down for...
2845000	2846000	Gotcha.
2846000	2847000	Okay.
2847000	2851000	I've got to hit the restroom real quick if we want to keep Joe in suspense for just a little longer.
2851000	2853000	Actually, I'll probably finish out the episode with Joe.
2853000	2854000	Okay.
2854000	2858000	We'll do one round with just him while you're kind of coming back.
2861000	2880000	Joe, Clark Bishop sees John Lee Pettymore fall face first into this murky, mucky, muddy six-inch splash zone.
2880000	2881000	God, no!
2881000	2888000	Right in front of Anne Love as she just kicks the back of his head down toward the ground.
2888000	2897000	And she looks up at you and her eyes are massive.
2897000	2907000	Take me to the fucking book, Clark!
2907000	2910000	You killed him! You killed him! I'm not taking you anywhere!
2910000	2912000	And I want to shoot again.
2912000	2916000	Did you have a second gun? Did you have two guns?
2916000	2919000	Oh, fuck. God fucking hell.
2919000	2922000	I did have two guns until I gave one to Drew.
2922000	2924000	You gave it to Drew, who I realized...
2924000	2926000	In re-listening to the episode, already had a gun.
2926000	2927000	Already had a gun!
2927000	2932000	Yeah. Yeah. Imagine how great I felt re-listening to that episode.
2932000	2934000	And especially now.
2934000	2940000	Drew's just driving off with his two guns.
2940000	2941000	God damn it.
2941000	2942000	He gives one to the cat.
2942000	2946000	Well, fuck. She said take me to the fucking book.
2946000	2951000	Clark's freaked the fuck out. Just saw John die.
2951000	2957000	Anne, I don't know where the book is. I don't know where the book is.
2957000	2961000	I can't help you. You fucking killed John! Why?
2961000	2969000	Any anger left on her face dissipates as a smile creeps in
2969000	2978000	across both corners of her mouth, lifting upward as she stares you directly in the eyes.
2978000	2983000	Well, Clark? The vector was my mission, wasn't it?
2991000	3019000	How am I the only one trying to pull over?
3019000	3030000	How can you have enough drowning out all the notes?
3030000	3034000	With no mind at all.
3034000	3038000	No mind at all.
3038000	3043000	No mind at all.
