0	5320	Hello, all, and welcome to the best radio show in town.
5320	11800	It's 694.2 PTBP, and I'm your host, Wolf the Dog.
11800	16280	I'm here to say things, and you are here to listen.
16280	18840	A perfect relationship.
18840	21680	Sometimes, you're here to say things,
21680	23640	and I'm here to listen.
23640	28160	This episode's Howlin' with Wolf is from Cupcake Sinclair
28200	31960	in Las Vegas, Nevada, who tweeted about the show
31960	36520	and tagged at PretendingPod, an easy and nice thing
36520	43200	you can also do to spread the love and joy of 694.2 PTBP
43200	45920	with your online friendos.
45920	51920	Cupcake Sinclair writes, PTBP equals amazing.
51920	54400	I'm hooked, and I love the reminder
54400	56960	that sex work is real work.
57040	60520	There is discrimination not only from society,
60520	63720	but credit cards dictating what can appear.
63720	69040	For example, TV can film sleeping, hypnosis, et cetera,
69040	70880	but we cannot.
70880	73600	I ask listeners to please consider
73600	77200	how hypocritical laws passed against sex workers
77200	81320	are a canary in the coal mine for wider changes that will
81320	84600	affect us all down the road, especially
84640	87720	in terms of what consenting adults do.
87720	89400	And that's just porn.
89400	93200	You know a sex worker whether you realize or not.
93200	97040	Thank you guys for your hard work, the hilarity you bring,
97040	100040	and the consideration of my announcement.
100040	104680	XOXO, submissive Cupcake Sinclair.
104680	107240	Well, damn, Cupcake Sinclair.
107240	110440	Thanks for all the shout outs and praise.
110440	114520	Let's make sure we all support sex workers' rights.
114520	117440	If you wanna write up something for your little Wolfie
117440	120800	to how, tag at pretending pod on Twitter,
120800	123840	tag at pretending pod on instant gram,
123840	127480	and tag pretending to be people on Facebook.
127480	130920	Or write up a five star review on the podcast app
130920	132280	of your choice.
132280	135280	If you give ol' Wolfie a shout out,
135280	138040	I might read that dang review right here
138040	140520	in the wettest broadcasting studio
140520	143000	this side of the Mississippi.
143000	146440	And this side, it means under.
146440	148320	Do you wanna check out our shit
148320	151080	without having to type a single letter?
151080	153560	All of our links are where?
153560	155600	Say it with me, children.
155600	157960	All of our links are where?
157960	160160	In the show notes.
160160	163240	Seriously, go look at the show notes.
163240	165400	It's wild stuff in there.
165400	168320	And it takes me about four hours to type them up
168320	171040	with these big ol' nasty paws.
171040	173160	Please acknowledge my hard work
173160	176160	and excellent use of language.
176160	179480	Now dial up for some vile fluff.
179480	181800	It's time for the news.
181800	185720	Last time, we met Shelly St. Blythe,
185720	189120	a crystal doctor with a penchant for puppetry
189120	193320	who witnessed something wildly unnatural back in the day.
193320	196600	He was at a dig site with the charming and capable
196600	201320	Dr. Brock Hargrave, as well as Jimmy Corrigan,
201320	206320	a badass merc with a soft spot for his wife and children.
206360	210120	A woman with myriad names, a shrinking frame,
210120	212440	and the voice of Jennifer Jason Leigh
212440	215360	continued building her personal strike team
215360	220360	with the owner of Boeri Security, Vincent T. Boeri,
221240	223320	who has an eye for fashion
223400	226600	and an even better eye for new employees.
226600	228880	And for this particular mission,
228880	233360	she rounded out the squad with a vagabond called Meat Hook.
233360	235480	They received their assignment
235480	237680	in this emaciated woman's house
237680	241160	that reeked of cat piss, sans the cats.
241160	243520	The briefing was as follows.
243520	246760	Dr. Brock Hargrave and one of his coworkers
246760	249800	at Holy Cow Farms have gone missing.
249800	252200	Dr. Hargrave headed out after work
252240	254280	and just didn't come back,
254280	257800	but his missing coworker seemingly never left
257800	261280	the office building of Holy Cow Farms,
261280	265720	taking us now to the death two-car convoy
265720	270720	of Jimmy Corrigan's Jeep and a, Jesus, a stretch Escalade?
271720	274280	Well, this team may be fucked,
274280	277120	but at least we have Hudson Freeman
277120	279920	with Muscles R. Spreems.
279960	280800	Let's go.
280800	281640	Let's go.
309920	314920	What's up, everybody?
314920	317500	I was thinking the same thing.
321560	323480	I am now mechanization.
328280	330960	All my muscles work like screams.
337480	338400	What's up, everybody?
338400	341240	Welcome to episode two of this short story here
341240	342840	on pretending to be people.
342840	344000	It's Holy Cow Farms time.
344040	344880	Holy Cow Farms.
344880	345720	Holy cow.
345720	346560	You know, we looked that up
346560	349960	and Zach, there's only two businesses in the country
349960	351440	that are currently named that.
351440	352560	So pretty good pun.
352560	353400	Pretty good.
353400	355320	And one of them is close enough
355320	357240	where we can go take a picture with the sign.
357240	358080	Yeah.
358080	360080	Or we can go break into their facilities.
360080	360920	We should do that.
360920	363400	We should break into the Holy Cow Farms
363400	365840	that's in Arkansas just as a tribute to this episode.
365840	367520	We should role play inside.
367520	369080	And cause we found out we're all cousins.
369080	370520	We are all cousins.
370520	372720	Us, Paul Rudd, who else?
372720	373640	The Royals.
374600	375440	Jon Hamm.
375440	376280	That's right.
376280	377400	Lord.
377400	378480	Mark Twain.
378480	380240	Ellie Kemper.
380240	381080	Ellie Kemper.
381080	381920	John Goodman.
381920	383320	Oh, Disney.
383320	385120	Jenna Fisher.
385120	386480	Good pull, yes.
386480	388480	Janelle Monae, but she won't claim it.
388480	389320	Ah, damn.
389320	390440	She's from KC though.
390440	391720	Did you say John Goodman?
391720	392760	No, I said John Goodman.
392760	394400	John Goodman.
394400	395240	Yeah.
395240	396080	Oh yeah, Brad Pitt.
396080	398720	Brad Pitt, he's from our town.
398720	400200	Our friend, Brad.
400200	402480	I found out something terrible about Brad Pitt.
402480	403320	What?
403840	405000	He was born in Oklahoma, not Missouri.
405000	405840	What?
405840	407160	Even though he grew up here
407160	408920	and spent his formative years in Springfield.
408920	411520	You really scared me for a minute there.
411520	415720	I really thought you were going to say something
415720	418720	to harm the reputation of our Lord and Savior, Brad Pitt.
419600	420480	Hey, hey, hold on.
420480	422000	This is the Jesus podcast.
423320	425640	Okay, any Jesus lover can admit
425640	429600	that Brad Pitt is as close as we got on this planet.
429600	431400	I want him opening the gates of heaven.
431400	432440	You know what I mean?
433760	437720	I recently watched him murder so many people on a train.
439360	441640	But did he feel bad about it?
441640	443440	He kind of did, honest.
443440	445080	Did any of you see that?
445080	445920	I did see it.
445920	446760	I still haven't seen it.
446760	448840	Bullet train, so fucking good.
448840	449680	Did you see it Becca?
449680	451280	Not yet, no.
451280	452120	You should.
452120	452960	It's a fun one.
452960	454080	I heard Luke and Joe liked it.
454080	458160	I heard it was more ensemble than Brad Pitt.
458160	461480	Yeah, he was the string that ran through the whole movie,
461480	462440	but it was great.
462480	465560	It was like a live action anime starring Brad Pitt.
466760	467600	That's all I need.
467600	468440	That's a great pitch.
468440	471280	Becca, I'm curious to hear a little bit more
471280	474080	about your role-playing history.
474080	476920	I'm sure you've shared this many, many times before,
476920	479800	but what brought you to this lovely hobby
479800	480640	that we all share?
480640	482480	The money, baby.
482480	484520	Fuck yeah, bro.
484520	486280	Pray the bills.
486280	491280	No, hey, I was just a bystander when crit role started.
491400	495440	Having snacks in the kitchen with them at Geek and Sundry,
495440	498280	and we played all kinds of other role-playing games there.
498280	503280	And at first, so competitive board gaming is my jam.
503880	504720	I love it.
504720	508400	Love me some magic, love me any competitive board game.
508400	512400	But once I understood intellectually
512400	514120	that you don't need to win,
514120	517400	in fact, it's way more fun to lose terribly,
517400	520160	that's when role-playing really clicked for me.
520160	522280	And I also have an acting background
522280	525000	from the University of Missouri, Kansas City.
527280	528360	I've driven by there.
530200	532400	So, you know, I just get to act,
532400	535360	but with only my voice and that's real fun.
535360	536200	Hell yeah.
536200	538200	Do you act with your whole body anyway
538200	539480	while you're doing voice acting?
539480	542980	Not today, because I kept my camera off.
544560	548040	But I mean, you've seen us waving our arms around wildly.
548080	550480	Are you doing that like just for no one?
550480	554200	Fun fact, when I do like a commercial voiceover,
554200	556680	I do wiggle my arms in the air.
556680	558200	Like they're little serpents
558200	561760	that are helping me to explain the product.
562760	565080	It's your favorite product you've sold with your voice?
565080	566840	Magic the Gathering.
567840	569480	Hell yeah.
569480	570320	Yeah, that's sick.
570320	572160	And it's a good tie-in for Delta Green,
572160	573600	because one of the artists
573600	575800	on the original Magic the Gathering run
575800	577940	was one of the creators of this game
578700	579700	that we're playing this evening, Delta Green.
579700	582380	Oh shit, I hope it's not one that was canceled.
583420	584260	I hope not.
585260	586100	Me too.
586100	587180	You know those OG artists,
587180	590900	there's some fucked up shit in some of that card stuff.
594180	596700	I'll Google Dennis Stettwiller canceled later
596700	597860	and we'll find out.
599380	600940	That's a leading question.
601940	605940	Does Meat Hook have a collection of banned Magic cards?
605940	608940	Meat Hook made her own banned Magic cards.
611940	615940	And she's remembering going through the cards in her mind
615940	618740	as you're driving, sitting in this car,
618740	621460	because it feels like Magic being inside a vehicle
621460	624220	for the third time in your life, Meat Hook.
624220	628220	And we see the holy cow of magic cards
628220	633220	and we see the holy cow farms office building,
633380	637340	except for holy cow farm seems to share this office building
637340	641440	with a few other companies listed on the sign out front.
641440	645860	It is a very boxy, nondescript office building
645860	648260	with a large parking lot
648260	651420	where you can park wherever you would like.
651420	653140	Today is a Tuesday.
653140	657560	It is 8.57 PM, almost nine o'clock.
657560	658880	The parking lot is dark.
658880	663020	There are orange lights, lighting up specific segments.
663020	666160	And there is a van parked up near the door
666160	669800	that says trolleys cleaning service.
669800	672120	And it's the van has like a paint job,
672120	673680	like it's a trolley car.
673680	674680	Goomba.
674680	677880	I've used those guys a hell of a lot.
677880	678920	They keep the mouth shut.
678920	681600	Wait, you say that like they're that kind of cleaner?
681600	682880	They do all sorts.
682880	684320	Well, they do my townhouse.
684320	687680	I'm sure they do a fricking fantastic job.
687680	689120	Perhaps they'll have a card.
690000	691960	You got a whole townhouse?
691960	693160	Oh, of course, yes.
693160	696360	Do you need someone to live in the basement or something?
696360	700460	Do you need?
700460	701960	It does get lonely there at times.
701960	705320	It would be fun to have a roommates of sorts, yes, sure.
705320	707120	Yeah, like a little basement creep.
708120	710480	Okay, well, maybe we could talk about me
710480	711600	being your basement creep.
711600	713440	Sure, exchange details.
713480	716480	I would love to have a basement creep, yes.
717920	719480	Okay, well, I live in the hold.
719480	721720	That's all the details I can really tell you.
724200	728760	The hold, is that ever on the third street or?
728760	730360	It's like way far outside of town.
730360	731920	There was a street sign once,
731920	735140	but somebody ripped it down and nobody ever fixed it.
737680	741000	Well, I'll give you my address and one day you'll be there
741000	743320	and I'll say, oh, there's the basement creep.
744160	744980	That's how I know you found the place.
744980	747440	This plan works out really well for me.
747440	750200	To be honest, I think this works out for the doc too.
750200	752900	You know, it could really use some companies.
752900	754240	He's going a little bit batty.
754240	757000	Oh, well, you know, we're all going a little batty.
757000	759360	I mean, people tell me I'm batty all the time
759360	763040	just because I stand on street corners handing out leaflets.
763040	764040	Leaflets?
764040	765080	Yeah, you want a leaflet?
765080	765920	Here.
765920	767160	If you've got one, of course, yes.
767160	768640	Let me read your literature.
768640	769460	Yeah.
769460	771280	And what's it about, this one?
771280	772680	That one?
772680	777680	That one's about how we need to be teaching kids
779020	781960	about the underground digging
781960	784640	because we're all gonna have to be mole people someday.
784640	787560	Oh my, you're a basement creep after my own heart.
787560	789480	Yes, get the children digging early on.
789480	791280	They might find things in the ground
791280	794000	and that ties directly into my profession.
794000	796580	We need more kids digging in the ground.
796580	798560	Yeah, I'd like to see one of those pamphlets too.
798560	800760	Oh right, you're like a gym guy, right?
800760	804280	I am an anthropologist, archeologist, historian.
804280	805120	Oh.
805120	807200	But yes, I guess you could call me a gym guy, sure.
807200	809380	We've got some uncut gyms, you know,
809380	811360	that you find there sometimes.
811360	812580	But that's not the real purpose.
812580	815340	The purpose is if we don't teach our kids
815340	818420	to be mole people now, they're gonna be really not used
818420	820440	to living without sunlight.
820440	822920	You know, I kind of thought you might be a little kooky,
822920	825080	but I am 100% in agreement with you
825080	826280	on the mole people issue.
826280	828440	Well, we could get started with your two kids.
828440	830000	Do you wanna put them underground?
830080	832240	I desperately want my kids underground.
832240	834120	Yeah, you could use this pamphlet.
834120	837080	I'm gonna teach those little fuckers to dig.
837080	838920	Enough about this underground shit.
838920	841120	I've got my eyes up to the skies.
841120	843360	They call me the Rock Man, if you didn't know that.
843360	844480	The Rock Man?
844480	845360	The Rocket Man.
845360	846200	Oh.
846200	847740	Rocket Man.
847740	851000	Yeah, I think that's someone else.
851000	856000	No, in this universe, there is no piano playing musicians
856000	860360	at all, except Billy Joel.
864240	865080	Anyway.
865080	868400	The only piano playing musician in this universe.
868400	871160	Vincente only listens to Billy Joel.
872120	874600	Bach never existed.
874600	875680	It can't be, right?
875680	878320	There must've been a piano player at some point.
878320	883320	Hey, Becca, can you roll a 50-50 up and down roll for me?
883560	884400	If he knows what's good for him.
884400	887520	So if you roll under 50, it'll be a luck success.
887520	890680	If you roll 50 or over, it'll be a luck failure.
890680	892720	Wolfgang Amadeus who?
897080	899240	Those words mean literally nothing to me.
901440	902520	How'd you roll, Becca?
902520	905600	Oh, sorry, I thought someone else was rolling.
905600	906440	Oh, no, sorry.
908640	910680	47.
910680	913520	That is, hell yeah, that is a success.
913560	916720	And so one of the cleaners comes down
916720	920920	and you see that they open up the front door
920920	923400	and walk over to the van
923400	926240	and they go into the back of the van.
926240	929120	If you continue watching, they pop out of the van
929120	930920	and they're smoking a cigarette
930920	934280	and they get on their phone and start chatting with someone.
934280	937740	I slip out the limousine Escalade
937740	940800	and I creep up behind them
940800	944720	and I wanna attack by jumping
944720	949720	from flat footed on the ground to onto their shoulders
949720	952240	and put them in a headlock, because I'm pretty small.
952240	954760	Okay, would you rather roll athletics
954760	956520	or unarmed combat for this?
956520	958800	I would like to roll the same thing, doesn't matter.
958800	960160	A classic would you rather?
962880	965200	Yeah, I wish there was hard success in this game
965200	967240	because I rolled a 12 under 50.
967240	969160	Nice. Nice.
969160	970320	They failed on their check,
970760	973160	so you can easily jump.
974720	978880	Meat Hook, they start sniffing the air as you approach,
980480	983160	but don't look back in time
983160	987160	and suddenly there's a tiny little dirty person
987160	991120	on this cleaner's back and they're on their phone.
991120	992280	Cleaner's worst enemy.
992280	997280	I squeeze their throat with my little arm
1008120	1010720	until they can't yell anymore.
1013280	1015960	Okay, go ahead and roll damage.
1015960	1017960	So that'll.
1017960	1020240	I squeeze with my little arm.
1020240	1022080	Someone who can't yell.
1023120	1025960	Go ahead and.
1025960	1028200	Wait, my damage is one D4?
1028200	1029160	Yeah, one D4 minus one,
1029160	1031480	and I'll give you an additional D4
1031480	1033840	because you snuck up on them.
1033840	1035560	I rolled a four on the first one
1035560	1037280	and a four on the second one.
1037280	1039240	This die is busted.
1039240	1041960	That's, was it minus one for each die?
1041960	1045000	It is, so with six hit points,
1045000	1049680	that actually takes down half of their hit points
1049720	1051360	in one fell swoop,
1051360	1054760	and they failed their constitution check to stay conscious,
1054760	1057760	which works out quite well for your plans.
1057760	1060280	As this person hits the ground
1060280	1064040	and their cell phone with it smashes onto the ground
1064040	1066360	and you just hear a voice coming out.
1066360	1069240	That's like, Dorothy, Dorothy, Dorothy.
1070480	1071440	It was a woman?
1071440	1073520	Yeah, it was a woman that you jumped on.
1074120	1079120	I feel like I've, you know, our sisterhood.
1081280	1082560	I betrayed her.
1083440	1084920	Well, too late.
1084920	1087560	Yeah, but you won one for the class struggle.
1090880	1091720	She's a-
1091720	1092560	Those cleaners.
1092560	1095880	I know, but urchins. City cleaners.
1095880	1097240	Urchins are pitted against the working class.
1097240	1098920	Yeah, but she's got a leg up on me.
1098920	1100240	I see what you're saying.
1101240	1105200	Vincente walks over and does she have like a key ring?
1105200	1106040	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1106040	1109040	You see that there is a key ring
1109040	1111960	with basically some normal keys,
1111960	1114800	as well as some like scan cards
1114800	1116960	that are attached to this ring.
1116960	1121280	And you see this phone also on the ground that-
1121280	1124400	Dorothy, Dorothy, should I, what do I do?
1124400	1128280	I look at Vincenzo, whatever your name is.
1128280	1129840	Close enough.
1130600	1132400	Should I pretend to be her?
1132400	1133240	Hold on.
1134720	1135560	Yes.
1136600	1138720	He rolled to say that.
1138720	1139560	You had to roll to see
1139560	1141520	if she should do the name of the podcast.
1144400	1147080	It could pretend to be people.
1147080	1149840	No, you can't do that.
1149840	1151040	Barrel down the camera.
1151040	1156040	Hi, it's sorry, I think I need a rest.
1159840	1164840	I was going to say it's me, Dorothy, but I made that one in.
1167720	1169560	Convince her.
1169560	1172160	Oh my God, Becca, please roll disguise.
1172160	1173000	Great.
1173000	1173840	Yeah, the skill you didn't take.
1173840	1176200	I added nothing to this skill.
1177560	1181920	Okay, so that's a 56 and I have a 10%.
1181920	1183200	That's a big failure.
1183200	1184040	Oddly enough.
1184040	1186200	The voice on the other end of the phone is like,
1187160	1190360	yeah, okay, all right.
1190360	1194160	Well, I have to take a nap in my van now.
1195640	1199680	Okay, Dorothy, sleep well.
1199680	1203160	Wait, can you remind me what we were just talking about?
1203160	1204920	And that's the scariest thing
1204920	1207800	this person on the other end has ever heard.
1207800	1210080	A different voice than their friend, Dorothy,
1211720	1214080	has taken the phone, says that,
1214120	1218160	and you hear a deadline on the other end of this.
1218160	1219720	I think I got away with it.
1222040	1224040	Very good performance there, Meathook.
1224040	1225360	Thank you, doctor.
1225360	1227400	You're going to be a really valuable asset
1227400	1230760	to the family after this, if you survive.
1230760	1232400	We don't even know why the cleaners were here.
1232400	1234840	This kid's going to get us all killed.
1234840	1237880	Things are really turning around for me.
1237880	1240880	I already get to be somebody's basement troll.
1241880	1245120	We're friends, a guy with spats on his shoes,
1245120	1247720	and this guy's, he's going to let me teach his kids
1247720	1249800	to dig on the ground.
1252360	1254800	You really ingratiated yourself with this group.
1256440	1258760	And to think we almost killed you.
1258760	1259600	What?
1261320	1263360	He thinks to himself.
1265080	1265920	He says out loud.
1265920	1266760	He says out loud.
1266760	1270120	You've got an interior monologue problem, I think.
1270960	1272000	It's just coming out.
1273720	1275080	No one ever tells me no.
1276520	1278520	Okay, glad we're friends.
1280360	1282920	He starts swinging the key ring around his finger
1282920	1286520	and just kind of jaunts into the open door
1286520	1287840	that Dorothy came out of.
1287840	1290000	Did we take Moses up on getting
1290000	1292880	some laminated name tags printed out?
1292880	1294560	Yeah, what did you want on those?
1294560	1297520	Mrs. Milk Woman.
1298440	1299960	Mrs. Milk Woman.
1299960	1301920	No, I don't know.
1301920	1303920	What do you think I should write?
1303920	1305640	Maybe not that, maybe.
1307720	1309680	Nobody looks at these things too hard.
1310880	1313600	Just give me a normal name, you know, like Meat Hook.
1316880	1318440	Milk Hook.
1318440	1319280	Milk Hook.
1319280	1321280	Milk Hook is perfect.
1321280	1322280	Mine just says Milk Hook one way.
1322280	1323880	They'll never know who it is.
1324400	1328760	I'd like my badge to say I'm a cleaner named Dorothy.
1331280	1332720	A well-timed flashback.
1334640	1336120	Oh, do you read minds?
1336120	1337880	Are you going with cleaners?
1337880	1342040	Are you going with some sort of governmental agency?
1342040	1344720	What kind of cover would you have?
1344720	1345760	Bug spray?
1345760	1348720	I think I just want to be a milk tech.
1348720	1350160	Classic milk tech.
1350160	1351800	I'm a milk tester.
1351800	1355440	I always infiltrate dairy offices as a milk tech crew.
1355440	1356280	That's right.
1356280	1358360	So classic milk tech group here.
1359640	1361920	You got your tester and three texts.
1365600	1367720	Yeah, and like Luke said,
1367720	1371840	the door is open and unlocked as you go over there.
1371840	1374120	I think you're the only one over there with the door open
1374120	1375640	as you call back to the rest of the group.
1375640	1376960	Hey, door's open.
1376960	1379480	Jimmy, can you do something about this body
1379480	1381520	that I incapacitated?
1382240	1384040	You got to learn how to deal with those mistakes
1384040	1384880	on your own.
1384880	1386160	Damn it, okay.
1386160	1388760	I put my arms under the armpits
1388760	1391040	and try and drag her into the back of the van.
1391040	1393360	Drag her into the van, just like that.
1393360	1394600	You're a natural.
1394600	1395920	You're a good father.
1395920	1396760	Thank you.
1396760	1398800	You teach, you don't do for it.
1398800	1402200	You know, you got to teach me to fish.
1403880	1406200	Hers says milk, hers says milk tech,
1406200	1408120	your name tag says bean dad.
1409640	1410720	Bean dad?
1410760	1413680	I just learned what this was today.
1415040	1415880	Oh no.
1417680	1419280	Bean dad's a wild internet.
1419280	1421120	Oh, I remember bean dad.
1421120	1421960	It's pretty sad.
1421960	1425600	When she says, teach me to fish, fish face pops his head off.
1428480	1430240	Now you fish face.
1430240	1431120	Okay, sorry.
1432040	1433000	Wait, fish face?
1433000	1433840	Yeah.
1433840	1436240	You remember that time we were sitting on that dock?
1438280	1439120	Yeah.
1439120	1440760	Looking at the moon.
1440760	1441600	Nevermind.
1441600	1442440	Nevermind.
1442440	1443760	It can never work.
1443760	1444680	Yeah, you're right.
1444680	1445520	Okay, bye.
1446720	1449000	Get back in the front seat next to Goomba.
1452360	1454120	Hey, get over here, Miwok, okay?
1454120	1455040	All right, let's do it.
1455040	1456040	Come on, let's hang out.
1456040	1457520	Okay, Miwok, all right.
1457520	1460320	Hey, Goomba, start turning the car around.
1460320	1461480	It's going to take a while
1461480	1463880	and we're going to have to get out of here quick.
1463880	1466200	That's like a 36 point turn.
1466200	1470200	I would imagine had I ever seen a ridden in cars before.
1470200	1471640	Wait, hold on, kid.
1471640	1472960	That's exactly right.
1472960	1474200	I think you're a natural.
1474200	1475840	Wait, are you some kind of math nerd?
1475840	1479160	No, it's just that, okay, it sounds silly,
1479160	1481280	but the spirits speak to me.
1481280	1483560	I think they're from another planet,
1483560	1486360	but it's more like another dimension.
1486360	1487840	I got a pamphlet about it.
1487840	1488680	Here.
1488680	1489920	Let's review this pamphlet.
1491360	1493240	Well, maybe we should go into this dairy farm
1493240	1495800	before whoever was on the line to Dorothy
1496320	1497520	comes looking for her.
1497520	1499440	No, what do these spirits say?
1500400	1502520	As Vincenti walks into Holy Cow Farms,
1502520	1505880	he reads aloud, just sometimes spirits talk to me.
1509160	1510000	Oh, nice.
1510000	1510840	Fascinating.
1510840	1512160	Cool, kid.
1512160	1513000	You're a little out there,
1513000	1514600	but I haven't seen anything in these pamphlets
1514600	1516440	that would disqualify you from a career
1516440	1518960	in extensive stretch limousineery.
1521320	1524440	As you guys are looking at the map on the wall
1524440	1526400	of this office building inside,
1526400	1529160	it's just got the different names
1529160	1531240	on which floors they're on.
1531240	1534920	And you see that Holy Cow Farms is on the eighth floor
1534920	1539040	of this building, and there are 12 floors total.
1539040	1541040	If I look at these other businesses
1541040	1543600	in having known Hargrave and being a colleague,
1543600	1545480	are there any other businesses that stand out
1545480	1547480	as maybe something else that he would have been
1547480	1550200	maybe here to look for or into?
1550200	1551200	Interesting.
1551200	1553040	Go ahead and roll.
1553080	1554320	While I think of something.
1554320	1556160	Yeah, exactly.
1556160	1558120	Makes a lot more sense than what I had.
1558120	1561840	I rolled a 49 on a 50 anthropology is what I rolled.
1561840	1563200	Okay, yeah, so.
1563200	1565520	For being aware of the profession.
1566760	1568520	Not that I'm using an anthropological skill.
1568520	1571920	With all of your knowledge of the field of anthropology.
1571920	1574400	Which includes all the articles about Dr. Hargrave
1574400	1576000	that he's obsessively like,
1577280	1579520	he knows the man through his study.
1579520	1581880	I mean, you see there's like a dermatologist
1581880	1585400	on the first floor, there's a cafe on the second floor,
1585400	1589000	on the third floor, there's a psychic
1589000	1594000	holding the same floor as a kid's play land.
1594520	1597760	And on the fourth floor, there's a massage parlor.
1603320	1605160	On the fifth floor, there's a karaoke place.
1605160	1609080	There's a bunch of places, none of which stand out to you.
1609080	1612680	But you're confident that whatever he was looking for
1612680	1616200	connection wise, it's probably at holy cow farms.
1616200	1619480	The kids, they're training to be psychic.
1619480	1621720	Now we know, he was here for the milk.
1621720	1623560	Which is what the handler had circled
1623560	1625040	in the name of the scenario.
1627880	1629720	I bet that's just a red herring.
1635000	1638120	And on the seventh floor, it says psychic kids.
1639320	1640280	Psychic children.
1640280	1641880	Psychic kids in adult play bed.
1641880	1644360	Play bed.
1644360	1646840	It just has bigger, it's a ball pit, but with bigger balls.
1646840	1650920	It's a child's sidekick in a disgusting ball pit.
1650920	1653720	It's not a bigger pit, it's the balls that are bigger.
1653720	1654560	Yeah.
1657760	1659520	Yeah, the other tracks.
1659520	1661160	One adult fits in at a time.
1662680	1664440	Does Trolley's cleaning service
1664440	1667200	have an office in the building?
1667200	1669680	No, they seem to have been here cleaning.
1669680	1670640	Good question.
1670640	1672520	I've done a little detective work.
1672520	1673960	These cleaners?
1673960	1675040	Probably cleaning.
1677040	1678000	Yes, very good.
1678000	1680000	Very good deduction, I see why we brought you along.
1680000	1682120	And as you all get into the elevator,
1682120	1683760	you see the same kind of sign
1683760	1686360	with all the different listings for the floors
1686360	1688720	as well as the buttons on elevators
1688720	1690680	where you click them to make it go up.
1690680	1692240	There's also the closed door button,
1692240	1693480	but it doesn't do anything.
1693480	1696400	Hey look, there's no 13th floor button in this one.
1697760	1701400	Yeah, you can't put a 13th floor button in an elevator.
1701400	1704360	No, especially if there's only 12 stories to it.
1706120	1708160	And he clicks the eighth button.
1708160	1710160	I have to go pee really bad, I'm sorry.
1710160	1711000	Hold it.
1711000	1711840	Okay, sounds good.
1711840	1716840	So the elevator doors open and you see a dark office.
1717160	1720400	We're gonna use the layout for the office office.
1720400	1721240	Tight.
1721240	1724080	So in front of you, you see-
1724080	1725520	A UK or American.
1727720	1728560	Good question.
1731880	1734560	I don't know the layout of the UK one nearly as well.
1734560	1735800	Pretty similar.
1735800	1737640	That makes sense.
1737640	1739320	Based on the scripts of the first season.
1739320	1744040	And so you see the round desk ahead of you,
1744040	1745120	coat rack on the right.
1745120	1746760	And yeah, the lights are off.
1746760	1748440	There seems to be no one here.
1748440	1749640	You fumble around with the keys.
1749640	1751760	You're looking at that all through the glass door.
1751760	1752960	Looking around the keys,
1752960	1756480	you see that one of the key cards is for Holy Cow Farms.
1756480	1760720	He sticks it in the keyhole and turns the key.
1760720	1762800	The light turns green, door opens.
1762800	1765040	On the other side, you hear the van.
1765040	1767040	Way outside running still.
1767040	1768360	It's a loud van.
1768360	1770160	It's a really loud van.
1770160	1773160	When the windows are open, it's hot, it's July.
1773160	1774600	They're trying to air it out.
1774600	1776920	I'm glad the windows open on the eighth floor
1776920	1777760	of this building.
1777760	1779560	It would make my job a lot easier
1779560	1781760	if I came here to do my normal job.
1781760	1784560	Oh, what sort of line of work are you in?
1784560	1785720	Window cleaning.
1787440	1790480	And you find that to be easier with the windows open?
1791440	1794000	Some strange world window cleaning.
1795120	1796680	I guess I've never thought about it much.
1796680	1798000	It must be.
1798000	1799080	Hold on.
1799080	1800240	With these windows open,
1800240	1802280	I wonder what they're trying to air out.
1802280	1805400	Can I do a check for smell?
1805400	1806320	Yeah, absolutely.
1806320	1808920	Go ahead and roll alertness or search.
1809880	1810720	Let's see.
1811840	1812760	Search.
1814920	1816200	Nope, it's a 56.
1816760	1818240	And I needed a 50.
1818240	1819520	Damn.
1819520	1821440	Sniffing the air, meat hook,
1821440	1825960	you smell something burning or burnt.
1825960	1828880	And Vincent is smoking a cigarette right next to you.
1828880	1829720	Okay.
1832000	1834480	There's a thick smoke next to you.
1835320	1836160	Obviously share the information.
1836160	1839280	And you notice that there's a trash can nearby
1839280	1842280	with a bunch of burnt popcorn that's been tossed into it.
1842280	1847120	Vincent would like to do a smell with his eyes around.
1849160	1850640	Yeah, I kind of figured this is a,
1850640	1852680	there's no one in here that you can see.
1852680	1855720	So this is going to be kind of an exploration kind of thing.
1855720	1856840	What are you looking for?
1856840	1857920	Where are you going?
1857920	1860080	I'm just kind of wandering through
1860080	1862680	and just like looking for blood.
1865160	1866080	What did you roll?
1866080	1868680	He's just not looking too hard.
1868680	1872640	Well, you don't find any blood.
1872640	1874280	Jimmy lets out a huge sigh and he's like,
1874280	1876920	all right, I'll teach you how to smell.
1879320	1882800	And he's going to roll an alertness nine.
1882800	1883640	Yeah, with a nine,
1883640	1886600	your sniffer smells the exact same cigarette smoke
1886600	1889520	and burnt popcorn that the others have been smelling.
1889520	1894520	But your alertness pass shows you to one of the desks nearby
1895360	1899600	that you see some paperwork strewn about.
1899600	1901160	And you notice, oh, this is-
1901160	1903000	It's covered in blood that he missed.
1904840	1906640	It's hand prints all the way up.
1907680	1910480	Big bloody arrows on the floor pointing to the desk.
1910480	1911320	This is help.
1914760	1918720	No, you see Dr. Brock Hargrave's desk
1918720	1920880	here at Holy Cow Farms.
1920880	1922520	You see a picture of him.
1922560	1925040	You see lots of papers all over his desk
1925040	1927360	that have his name on them.
1927360	1930800	And there is a computer at his workstation
1930800	1934960	as well as a large file cabinet.
1934960	1936480	Yeah, you're at his desk.
1936480	1938720	You see that there are probably what,
1938720	1942920	like 14, 16 desks around the office and little pods.
1942920	1945480	This guy sat in Dwight's desk.
1947800	1948640	Nice.
1948640	1952040	Yeah, I pick his phone like of Jell-O, toss it aside.
1952920	1954880	Doc, I think you better get over here
1954880	1956320	and look at some of these files.
1956320	1960080	Yes, I'm very curious what Brock Hargrave was doing
1960080	1961680	here at Holy Cow Farms.
1961680	1966180	And you see a picture of him holding up this artifact
1966180	1969620	on this expedition that you are in the picture,
1969620	1970880	you were in the expedition,
1970880	1975160	but the way he's holding out his arm in gleeful triumph
1975160	1978080	is blocking your face from being seen in the picture.
1979360	1981960	Look, see, this is me and Brock.
1982920	1984080	I promise, that's me there.
1984080	1985460	You can't quite see my face,
1985460	1988120	but I was once a person who would go
1988120	1989520	on these expeditions like this.
1989520	1991360	It's him, Meat Hook, I was there.
1991360	1995200	Oh yeah, yeah, no, you got the kind of same chunky middle.
1995200	1996120	Yeah, I see.
1997000	2000920	Yes, yes, yes, the chunky middle, yes.
2000920	2002360	Stand aside, let me look,
2002360	2004280	and I start rummaging through his papers.
2004280	2006060	Rummaging through his papers, I'm gonna go pee.
2006060	2007440	I have to.
2007440	2010880	Yeah, I was just joking earlier when I said don't pee.
2012940	2014280	I'm very sneakily eating.
2017240	2019200	Do it less sneaky.
2020480	2022820	You want a mukbang?
2025320	2027060	You don't know about mukbangs?
2027060	2027900	No, I do.
2027900	2028740	We know.
2028740	2030900	The whole idea, really, I dislike.
2033280	2034280	You asked for it.
2035740	2036580	Crunch.
2036580	2038100	You can chew as lot as you fucking want.
2038100	2041340	Boy, that's a whole lot of papers.
2042020	2045460	It's taking me quite some time to get through these.
2045460	2047900	Read all his notes while he's gone.
2047900	2049660	We'll just totally ruin the adventure
2049660	2051940	and say go exactly where you...
2053180	2056100	Skip to the last page to see who did it.
2056100	2058540	Now that's the way to choose your own adventure.
2059720	2060940	I choose to win.
2063360	2065140	I'm not gonna let a stupid book beat me.
2065140	2066460	That's what we call Zach.
2067180	2072180	Becca, I saw that you played Bleak Prospect
2072300	2073700	with the Glass Cannon crew,
2073700	2076260	and it was like a week after we had just got done playing it
2076260	2077980	with Scott Dorwood, the guy who wrote it.
2077980	2080700	And it was really fun to see you guys do
2080700	2082020	a totally different...
2082020	2084780	Oh man, yeah, that was a Bleak one.
2084780	2086540	That was so fun.
2086540	2088080	I can't believe you played with Scott Dorwood.
2088080	2089380	That's amazing.
2089380	2090860	It was super cool, yeah.
2090860	2092180	We've played with him a couple of times now.
2092180	2094060	He's run us through some of his stuff.
2094060	2095980	He's like our podcast grandpa.
2096860	2097900	I played with him once.
2097900	2099400	It hasn't come out yet though.
2100620	2103100	Did you guys play some Call of Cthulhu?
2103100	2105620	On an award-winning podcast.
2105620	2108780	Oh, an award-winning podcast you say?
2108780	2111220	They won best podcasts at the Innies.
2111220	2112060	Nice.
2112060	2112900	Was it on The Daily?
2112900	2114100	It was The Daily.
2114100	2117780	I played Call of Cthulhu.
2117780	2119620	I'm Michael Barbaro.
2120860	2122500	This is Call of Cthulhu.
2122500	2124500	Here's what else you need to roll today.
2126740	2127580	Love it.
2128580	2130300	Boy, it's taken you quite a while
2130300	2132340	to shuffle through all those papers.
2132340	2134540	There's just a lot here, it's a lot to get through,
2134540	2137020	but I'm not seeing exactly...
2137020	2138340	Emma?
2138340	2140580	Lights start going off.
2140580	2145580	Red lights illuminate the entirety of this office.
2146500	2150140	And a small voice says,
2150140	2153940	Hello, an intruder has been found here.
2153940	2158260	Please call the security company if this is an alarm.
2158260	2161100	Hello, an intrusion has been found here.
2161100	2166100	Please call security if this was a mistake.
2167620	2169180	Jeremy, I'm going to try this again.
2169180	2172460	I've never heard a more confused automated message,
2172460	2173660	but I'm going to give it a try
2173660	2177140	and I take the phone out of the jello and press like those.
2177140	2181580	It says call security if it's a break-in.
2181580	2185180	If we don't call, the security won't come?
2185180	2186020	You're right.
2186020	2186860	I think you're right.
2186860	2187700	That is correct, yes.
2187700	2188540	That's what they said.
2188540	2191220	That is what the voice said very explicitly, yes.
2191220	2192700	Those were great instincts, Meathook.
2192700	2193700	I hang up the phone.
2194940	2198100	Okay, wow, we really dodged that bullet.
2198100	2199900	Phew, that was a close one.
2201220	2203820	Wow, I'm not used to all these indoor lights.
2204740	2205580	Pfft.
2209740	2211380	With the flashing red lights
2211380	2213660	continuing to illuminate your search,
2213660	2216500	I need everyone who is searching
2216500	2219180	to go ahead and roll a search check for me.
2219180	2220580	We'll see what you find in this place.
2220580	2221860	Ooh, a crit pass.
2221860	2223420	It's a 22 on a 60.
2223420	2226300	Well, that will fucking do it, huh?
2227980	2231420	Vincenty regular passes as he smiles,
2231420	2232860	knowing that this building
2232860	2235140	bought one of his security systems.
2235140	2239260	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
2239260	2241340	Meathook fails.
2241340	2244260	You know, computers, not my thing.
2245220	2248420	Are you doing the Zoolander thing on one of them?
2248420	2250620	And the pages are too big.
2250620	2251900	Eight and a half by 11,
2251900	2255860	I need a four by six square leaflet.
2258060	2258900	I love that.
2258900	2260180	Scott, you might have a future
2260220	2261380	in the printing industry too,
2261380	2263100	if limousining doesn't work out.
2264220	2265660	Well, thank you.
2265660	2268500	You've learned a lot about leaflets in your time.
2268500	2270020	Well, you know, I dabble.
2270020	2271340	I dabble in zines.
2275620	2278380	How long have you been dabbling in the anarchy scene?
2279420	2281300	No, zines with a Z.
2281300	2282140	Oh, zines.
2282140	2284260	Zines, which is part of the anarchy scene.
2284260	2286460	Oh yeah, all my life, baby.
2286860	2289900	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
2289900	2292660	Okay, so Shelly St. Blythe,
2292660	2293740	with your critical success,
2293740	2295100	we're going to come back to you.
2295100	2295940	Okay.
2295940	2299300	The success was Vincenti Boeri.
2299300	2300140	Yes?
2300140	2301220	Yes.
2301220	2302700	Thank you.
2302700	2304460	As you're going through the desk,
2304460	2307060	you're kind of feeling around
2307060	2308700	and you feel underneath,
2308700	2312980	there's this kind of wooden piece that is sticking out.
2312980	2314020	And when you flick it,
2314060	2318300	a false bottom comes out from the main drawer of this desk.
2318300	2319220	When it pops down,
2319220	2322380	you see it's full of notes about things
2322380	2326540	that have been brought to Trigate Supply.
2326540	2331540	You see a map of the city with little dots poking around
2331900	2336740	in a specific kind of layout at the Zeitgeist,
2336740	2340180	which is an abandoned space needle here in the city.
2340180	2341300	That's cool.
2341300	2342740	Yeah, it is.
2342740	2345620	Shout out to Dylan B from Deadwood, South Dakota,
2345620	2347940	for giving us the Zeitgeist.
2347940	2348780	Nice.
2348780	2349620	And while we're here,
2349620	2350860	shout out to Zakharov Salyer,
2350860	2353700	another $10 up patron for Trigate Supply.
2353700	2354540	And finally,
2354540	2359020	you see a handwritten note scrawled on the bottom corner
2359020	2361420	of one of these pages that says,
2361420	2364860	Strummer's Crystal, question mark.
2364860	2367700	Doctor, you know almost as much as this guy,
2367700	2369820	but definitely not as much about crystals
2369820	2371820	and stuff found in the earth.
2371860	2373380	What's this Strummer's thing?
2374380	2376540	Did you say Strummer's?
2376540	2379340	You would know that there is a shop in town
2379340	2382180	called Strummer's Resonating Crystals,
2382180	2384660	and it is owned by Aaron Strummer.
2384660	2387060	Shout out to Dale Armont from Arkansas.
2387060	2388180	Yee-haw.
2388180	2390300	The land of actual crystal shops.
2390300	2392780	The land of crystal shops and holy cow farms.
2392780	2393620	Yeah.
2393620	2394780	Whoopee.
2394780	2396620	Whoopee.
2396620	2397460	Whoopee.
2397460	2399820	Yes, that's Aaron's establishment.
2399820	2402380	That's where I do most of my gym shopping.
2402380	2407380	What could Hargrave want with a gym shop that I frequent?
2407820	2409460	Is he trying to do me in?
2409460	2411260	Is he trying to finish me off for good?
2411260	2412260	Or maybe just prank you.
2412260	2413780	He really likes to mess around.
2413780	2416420	I mean, I think you gotta just let this guy stop having...
2416420	2418580	Obviously we have to finish this mission,
2418580	2419420	but in general,
2419420	2421900	this guy needs to have less space in your head.
2422900	2425300	Shelly needs a minute to clear his head,
2425300	2427420	and he walks off into the other room
2427420	2430660	and walks directly into the security room
2430660	2435660	with some TVs around and different like VHS tapes
2436300	2439220	lining the wall with different dates on it
2439220	2442660	and tiny little security TVs that you could play them on.
2442660	2443620	Nobody here though?
2443620	2444860	There's nobody here now.
2444860	2446620	You just walk right into this room.
2448300	2449140	Looking around,
2449140	2452140	it just seems to be looking at holy cow farms only,
2452140	2453460	not the rest of the building.
2453460	2454300	I kind of turn...
2454300	2456660	There's only like three cameras in here.
2456740	2459060	I kind of turn to the rest of the room.
2459060	2460820	I believe I found the nerve center
2460820	2462860	for the security operation.
2462860	2465420	We might be able to see what may have happened that day
2465420	2468140	that Hargrave left and his coworker disappeared.
2468140	2473020	Well, if the security system is all my security system,
2473020	2474380	it's probably not gonna work great,
2474380	2478420	but we can try.
2478420	2480540	But it looks so expensive.
2480540	2482460	It does look expensive, yes.
2482460	2483300	It is expensive.
2483300	2484660	It is very expensive, yeah.
2484660	2485940	You guys keep having this conversation
2485940	2489460	as the red lights are just like blinking and flashing.
2489460	2491140	Vincenzi just makes a call.
2495620	2496460	The lights...
2496460	2498820	Roll bureaucracy real quick, Vincenzi.
2501180	2502380	Crit fail.
2502380	2504020	Oh shit, I thought it was a crit pass.
2504020	2505380	22 on a 10.
2506460	2507300	Very cool.
2507300	2508460	Is there something better than bureaucracy
2508460	2509780	you could justify?
2509780	2510820	I'm sure there is.
2510860	2511860	How about...
2515300	2517460	Really feels like it would be bureaucracy.
2517460	2519220	You seem like you're really trying
2519220	2520060	to come up with something.
2520060	2520900	Italian.
2522500	2524820	It's an Italian security system.
2526700	2530300	And I speak to the security guys in Italian on the phone.
2533740	2534940	I'm gonna go with a no.
2538020	2540700	This is one of those excellent times
2541540	2545780	when you have to put your foot down and say no.
2545780	2547260	I love saying yes.
2547260	2548780	Not a chance in this case.
2548780	2552260	As you call your own security company,
2552260	2553500	they have your direct number.
2553500	2554740	So someone picks up there.
2554740	2555780	Hey, what's up?
2555780	2560540	Hey, no one's breaking into the building
2560540	2562340	that Holy Cow Farms is in.
2562340	2564140	So turn off the alarm.
2564140	2566500	Oh, okay.
2566500	2568380	No, what do you mean?
2568380	2569340	How do you know?
2569340	2570180	What do you mean?
2570180	2571500	Who called you?
2571500	2574380	I'm sorry to kind of bark up the ladder,
2574380	2577220	but I feel like maybe following orders
2577220	2578700	isn't what you hired me to do.
2578700	2580460	You hired me because I'm a small individual
2580460	2581660	who thinks of myself, you know?
2581660	2582500	Damn it.
2585380	2588220	You'll never make that mistake again.
2588220	2589060	Fuck.
2589060	2589900	And he hangs up.
2589900	2591580	I think you gotta kill that guy.
2591580	2592420	Fantastic.
2593540	2597100	Oh, hey, that might be your first job out of here.
2598020	2598860	Oh.
2598860	2600540	I call back and get that guy's name.
2600540	2602340	I thought you were offering this kid
2602340	2604780	a legitimate job and moon rocks.
2604780	2606260	Yeah, I've never killed before.
2606260	2608100	It's not really my thing.
2608100	2609940	God willing, you'll never have to.
2609940	2610780	Forget I said anything.
2610780	2611980	We'll talk about it afterwards.
2611980	2614320	And then he just writes down the guy's name
2614320	2615160	that was on the phone.
2615160	2617580	We're gonna have a real wacky dynamic
2617580	2620620	when we're three grandfathers living.
2620620	2621460	Yeah, wack.
2621460	2622300	It's Shelly's family.
2622300	2623620	Exactly wacky.
2623620	2627260	The rat that lives in the basement.
2629260	2630500	It's a sitcom.
2632060	2633780	Dinner's ready, basement rat.
2634820	2636980	As you guys are having this conversation.
2637980	2639660	Broccoli again.
2639660	2640660	Shelly St. Blythe.
2640660	2641700	Now, now.
2641700	2644500	Shelly St. Blythe has been dutifully going through
2644500	2647740	the different VHS cassettes and finding the day
2647740	2650380	that is just from two days ago.
2650420	2652820	The day that was the last time
2652820	2655840	that Dr. Brock Hargrave had come into Holy Cow Farms
2655840	2659860	and the day that his coworker did not ever clock out.
2659860	2662880	And you see on the security footage,
2662880	2666420	the two of them around, I don't know, 3.30,
2666420	2670940	walk into the kitchen area where there's no camera present.
2670940	2671780	Damn it.
2671780	2674380	It's so important to have a camera in the kitchen.
2674380	2677040	You gotta see who steals your yogurt, I imagine,
2677040	2678660	if you have a refrigerator.
2678700	2682020	That's the prime place where most office thefts occurs,
2682020	2682860	the kitchen.
2682860	2685780	And except for bathrooms, it's where most accidents occur.
2686740	2687940	Yeah.
2687940	2691540	And you see Dr. Brock Hargrave at Holy Cow Farms.
2691540	2695060	He is wearing the exact same clothes
2695060	2697300	that you've always seen him in.
2697300	2701300	He is in full-blown field archaeologist gear
2701300	2702900	working at this office.
2702900	2704260	And a cowboy hat?
2704260	2706580	Yep, cowboy hat included.
2706580	2711500	And when he walks out of this kitchen area
2711500	2714740	back into frame, into the office,
2714740	2718380	he is holding an open yogurt container.
2718380	2723140	The spoon is just like hanging limply in his other hand,
2723140	2726540	his mouth agape as it looks down.
2726540	2731540	And the hand with the spoon in it kind of rubs at his belly,
2731900	2735980	looks up directly into the security camera,
2736220	2739420	turns around, looks back at the room where he came from,
2739420	2742940	looks back at the security camera, nervously smiles,
2742940	2745780	looking at his belly and rubbing it continuously
2745780	2747300	as he walks back.
2747300	2749700	And is this the last time we've seen
2749700	2752940	this the friend appear again on cameras?
2752940	2754920	For the rest of that day and for the next day,
2754920	2758260	as you skim through, you do not see this coworker.
2758260	2760060	Well, he fucking ate him.
2760060	2762340	Shelly, you know this guy.
2762340	2764940	Is that his normal sort of behavior?
2764940	2768380	I've never seen how he reacts to yogurt himself,
2768380	2772260	but no, in general, he does not rub his belly,
2772260	2773880	satisfied after a meal.
2775580	2777980	The only time I ever saw him rub his belly like that
2777980	2780780	was when he ate a man.
2780780	2785820	As he is wont to do.
2785820	2789180	The more alarming thing is that his friend did not re-emerge.
2789180	2792080	That friend could still be somewhere in that kitchen
2792080	2792920	as we speak.
2792920	2794300	Let's go open the fridge.
2794300	2796080	As you guys walk over to the kitchen,
2796080	2800220	you hear sirens in the distance through the open windows
2800220	2802420	of the eighth floor of this office building.
2802420	2803260	Oh, right.
2803260	2804840	That time we called security
2804840	2808220	and then they clearly knew we were lying.
2808220	2810860	And that other time where I took the phone
2811900	2813700	and pretended to be someone.
2813700	2815700	And now I'm thinking maybe she knew
2815700	2818100	I wasn't pretending to be people so good.
2818500	2823100	As we all look into the camera.
2823100	2828100	Everyone, Jim's the camera, since we're here.
2829220	2832620	So quick search the kitchen before we've run.
2832620	2835700	I can show y'all how to climb down a fire escape.
2835700	2837780	What's the fastest way to the sewers?
2837780	2841020	You are definitely going to be able to get out of here
2841020	2842900	cleanly if you leave now.
2842900	2846740	If you search the kitchen, you're going to maybe risk it.
2846860	2849020	Just like a quick pop open the fridge
2849020	2850660	to see if there's not a body in there.
2850660	2851800	Oh, there's no body in the fridge.
2851800	2853260	All right, let's get the fuck out of here.
2853260	2855900	Vincenty pulls his gun out of his briefcase
2855900	2858940	and wants to look around just a little harder.
2858940	2860680	Okay, are the rest of you staying or going?
2860680	2863940	I'll scope things out from the roof.
2863940	2865780	Even though, let me tell you,
2865780	2868640	the fastest way to the sewer is through the toilet.
2871900	2872720	Since you asked.
2872720	2874060	Vincenty agrees, he's like.
2874060	2874900	Vincent.
2876180	2879620	We'll flush ourselves down the toilet to escape the cops.
2879620	2881580	They'll never expect it.
2881580	2882540	In a place like this,
2882540	2885180	they might have an industrial sized one.
2885180	2886460	They got cows here.
2886460	2887300	For Kevin.
2888180	2891780	They've got cow shitters here, I'm sure of it.
2891780	2893020	Here in the office office,
2893020	2895740	on the eighth floor of this office building.
2895740	2897340	Yes, definitely.
2897340	2899420	Well, yeah, that's why there's not cow shit everywhere.
2899420	2900940	That's exactly right, because the cow shitter,
2900940	2902700	the single one.
2902700	2906460	Okay, so are we flushing ourselves down this cow shitter?
2906460	2908180	Are we running out the back door?
2908180	2910260	Looking at this slightly large toilet,
2910260	2912900	do you think, I don't know if I'm gonna live.
2912900	2916320	Vincenty wants to look in the kitchen first.
2916320	2917540	Go ahead and roll search, I suppose.
2917540	2921520	Yeah, he thinks back to all of the crimes
2921520	2924100	he has cleaned up in kitchens.
2924100	2924940	Natch.
2924940	2927340	And he's like, I've never committed a crime
2927340	2929660	in a kitchen, I guess.
2929660	2931780	We can't hear you, we're far down the cow shitter.
2931780	2933620	That's right.
2933620	2935540	Wait, where'd you guys go?
2935540	2939260	You guys take off running out of this office,
2939260	2941420	closing the door behind you.
2941420	2944520	Is anyone trying to clean up any of the mess
2944520	2946780	that you've made since you've been here,
2946780	2948740	shoving everything kind of back where it was?
2948740	2950260	The only mess would be Hargrave's desk, right?
2950260	2951100	That's right, yeah.
2951100	2954260	Then yeah, probably as we're running past it,
2954260	2957420	he would try to at least close up the secret panel
2957420	2958820	that had the stuff inside it.
2958820	2959640	Done.
2959640	2961700	And you guys head down the hallway,
2962620	2964460	you're taking the stairs to the elevator.
2964460	2967300	Smart, elevator's out when the alarm's on.
2967300	2970300	I'll meet you guys down there, I'm taking the elevator.
2970300	2971140	No, I'm not really.
2971140	2972340	You click the button.
2972340	2974840	I comically grabbed the doctor by his shirt,
2975900	2977960	falling down the stairs.
2977960	2979740	Eight floors down.
2979740	2982500	Go ahead and roll athletics.
2982500	2983420	Well.
2983420	2985980	Everybody, everybody, everybody, athletics.
2985980	2987420	This is what I'm made for.
2988820	2989660	Nope.
2989660	2992540	With the doctor on my back, I trip.
2993780	2995500	Oh no, did we all fail?
2995500	2996340	I failed.
2996340	2997700	I failed.
2997700	3000400	I forgot to eat any food for days.
3001820	3003240	For some dry ramen.
3004220	3007100	And now I'm out of energy.
3007100	3008800	Vincenti passes.
3008800	3010140	Oh, he just fucking dies?
3011660	3012500	Oh, wait.
3013180	3016580	You definitely run down the stairs easy peasy
3016580	3018140	and you look back and we're all just like
3018140	3021580	hanging off the railing in awkward angles.
3021580	3025140	Just exhausted, covered in flop sweat
3025140	3027980	as you've made it down the end of this
3027980	3032980	un-air conditioned stairwell in July heat here in the city.
3032980	3037260	It is sweltering and you all are dripping mops
3037260	3038860	when you arrive at the bottom.
3038860	3041260	In the meantime, I turn around and saw
3041260	3043580	that they were not gonna make it out quick enough.
3043580	3047260	So, Vincenti runs out the door they came in.
3047260	3048100	Yep.
3048100	3049860	Runs a couple streets down and fires off
3049860	3051660	a couple shots on his gun.
3051660	3053940	That is a long turn that you just did.
3053940	3055680	Yeah, you ran two blocks.
3055680	3058100	A block away.
3058100	3061800	I wanna draw attention elsewhere.
3064380	3065220	Okay, sounds good.
3065220	3068780	So, Vincenti, you are a block away,
3068780	3070180	away from the parking lot
3070180	3072460	and you are firing your gun in the air
3072460	3075780	as the rest of you get into the...
3075780	3078580	To like the level five is on the wall.
3081220	3083860	It feels a lot faster when you take the elevator.
3086420	3087380	Trust me, it's not.
3087380	3089000	This way is a lot speedier.
3091000	3092680	I feel like I should have been able to do this.
3092680	3093980	This is the thing I'm good at.
3093980	3096100	Yeah, me too.
3096100	3098940	But we've got the doctor care like stretched between us.
3098940	3099780	Oh yeah.
3100140	3102340	Believe it or not, I'm pretty fit for my age.
3103340	3105100	I just am having trouble today.
3106020	3107500	65.
3107500	3108340	Okay.
3108340	3109460	I've never been in that good a shape.
3109460	3110780	I just got lucky today.
3113300	3116300	Which explains why you are far off.
3116300	3118860	You see sirens in the distance, they turn
3118860	3121420	and as they're heading down the street
3121420	3122940	that would lead them to the parking lot
3122940	3126540	for this exact reasoning, they hear the gunshots
3126540	3129020	and immediately make a turn
3129020	3132000	and begin heading in your direction.
3132000	3135340	You also see the stretch Escalade
3135340	3138140	pull up to the front of the office building.
3138140	3139740	I ran in to grab my Jeep.
3139740	3142420	You sprint across the parking lot to your Jeep
3142420	3144560	as these sirens are getting closer
3144560	3149260	and they are barreling down on Vincente Bowery.
3149260	3151660	He puts his gun back in his briefcase
3151660	3156060	and just walks towards the Escalade casually.
3157420	3160340	I mean, you did a sacrifice move for the other three
3160340	3164500	and so the security car pulls up in front of you
3164500	3167940	and the window rolls down and I want you to roll
3167940	3170220	a charisma real quick right off the bat.
3170220	3171380	Actually, no, don't roll.
3171380	3172780	Tell me what your charisma is.
3172780	3173620	Passive.
3173620	3174440	80.
3174440	3175780	Jesus Christ.
3175780	3177500	Yeah, could my 80 athletics have gotten me
3177500	3180660	a passive success to go down the stairs?
3180700	3181540	No.
3185060	3185900	No.
3185900	3190900	And so the security guy rolls down the window
3191500	3195180	and is like, hey there mister, did you see anyone
3195180	3197620	firing off a gun up in the air over?
3197620	3199820	And he points right to where you just were
3199820	3201420	like two minutes ago.
3201420	3202260	Bitch face?
3202260	3203080	Yeah.
3203080	3204920	You know what I mean?
3204920	3209920	Yeah, I saw, it was a super, super tall guy
3216280	3221280	with like super long hair and really huge long fingernails
3222160	3227160	and he wasn't wearing any clothes and he screamed,
3227160	3230020	I'm gonna run all the way that way.
3230020	3235020	And he took off running in the opposite direction
3235060	3237620	of where I, I heard him say he's going that way.
3237620	3241540	I said, I'm getting way far away from him, he's scary.
3241540	3243500	And so that's why I'm walking this way.
3244460	3246080	Anyway, you better go get him.
3249100	3252580	I think with your 80 charisma and just seeing
3252580	3253420	the vision of you.
3253420	3254500	And it was such a good lie.
3254500	3256100	It was such a good lie.
3256100	3260180	Also, this was before I started hiring smart people
3260180	3262660	to work for me and this was just one of the goons
3262660	3264460	that works for my security company.
3264460	3268620	Yeah, the inside of every one of the security cars
3268620	3271780	has a picture of you hanging from the rear view mirror
3271780	3273420	to remind them who they work for.
3274940	3277620	And the logo is like a badge with his face on it.
3278820	3282700	And he's like, oh, oh, you're, wow, I didn't think
3282700	3285140	I'd get delicious information from my boss
3285300	3286140	not like tonight.
3286140	3287620	You better go catch him.
3287620	3290060	And immediately pedal to the metal
3290060	3290900	and press his boss.
3290900	3292660	I can't do everything around here.
3296340	3298020	Perfect getaway.
3299060	3301380	Clean as a whistle.
3301380	3305580	You see, you see there's the van.
3305580	3307500	There seems to be like some rummaging about
3307500	3310740	in the cleaning van that is parked right outside
3310740	3313580	the front of this office building as you're walking over
3313580	3317020	to meet the stretch escalate that is now meeting you
3317020	3317860	in the parking lot.
3317860	3320860	Did any like mops or brooms happen to fall out
3320860	3323540	of the back of that van when the doors were open
3323540	3324780	during the struggle?
3324780	3325620	Dozens.
3329740	3331340	Multiple dozens.
3334300	3336060	It is, you know, an office building.
3336060	3337460	There's a lot of cleaning.
3337460	3338820	A lot of sweeping up, a lot of mopping.
3338820	3341460	You need a different broom for each room.
3342380	3346380	I mean, yeah, the van, the cleaning van was open
3346380	3347220	at one point.
3347220	3351220	Yeah, and dozens of mops and brooms fell out.
3351220	3353380	I grab, I grab a broom.
3353380	3356780	I know that this isn't how car doors work,
3356780	3358860	but I stick it in the, in the handle.
3358860	3361180	So she can't get out of the back of the van.
3363140	3364940	Oh, is that what the rummaging was?
3364940	3366860	I thought the police were another like detail.
3366860	3368900	No, just someone coming to inside.
3368900	3370100	Gotcha, gotcha.
3370140	3371980	So I do that and it works.
3371980	3373380	Oh, congratulations.
3373380	3375060	I want to talk through the door.
3375060	3376060	Hey, Dorothy.
3377980	3380140	You guys are now pulled up next to this cleaning van
3380140	3382260	and you've pulled up in such a way to where
3382260	3384540	that she can't get out of the driver's side,
3384540	3387300	which is the seat that she's kind of gotten herself into.
3387300	3390300	And she's looking at you kind of horror,
3390300	3391820	trying to figure out whether she should roll
3391820	3393020	down the window or not.
3394340	3395180	Roll it down.
3395180	3396900	Have you any Grey Poupon?
3397100	3401420	I always wanted to say that.
3404420	3405260	Oh yes.
3405260	3406100	Very good one.
3406100	3406940	Very good one.
3406940	3409780	And she just lifts up a bottle of Evian
3409780	3411420	and holds it up to you.
3411420	3412260	Calm down.
3412260	3413100	Is that poison?
3413100	3414140	Don't, don't do it Dorothy.
3415620	3416620	What's the pH?
3416620	3418220	Cause I can tell you some things.
3420020	3423620	You see a TED talk about like water levels?
3423620	3425540	Sweetie, I am your TED talk.
3426540	3429140	Now tell me, what were you here cleaning up?
3429140	3432420	Cause I know a company like Trolley's,
3432420	3434580	they don't do your normal messes.
3437140	3439140	Do you want a taste of this arm around your neck
3439140	3439980	one more time?
3442460	3444100	She rolls up the window quickly.
3445700	3446740	Don't do that.
3446740	3448620	Don't do that Dorothy.
3448620	3449580	Rolling it back up.
3449580	3450500	Rolling it back up.
3452500	3453660	Normal cleaning.
3453660	3455260	Just a regular cleaning, huh?
3455860	3456940	It breaks down, starts crying.
3456940	3458140	You guys can roll him it.
3458140	3459420	Dorothy the kid's right.
3459420	3461300	You don't need all these brooms and mops
3461300	3462700	for normal cleaning.
3462700	3464540	I failed a 19 on a 10.
3464540	3465380	Damn.
3465380	3466980	I failed as well.
3466980	3467820	I failed real bad.
3467820	3468660	Damn, damn, damn.
3468660	3469500	Damn, damn, damn, damn.
3469500	3471100	She seems like she's fine.
3471100	3471940	She's just crying.
3471940	3474900	She's like, it's real cleaning.
3474900	3478300	Well, I don't know why anybody would lie about that.
3478300	3480700	I don't know what else she can teach us.
3480700	3484060	No, I'm not a, I'm not doing a TED talk.
3484100	3485580	I don't have your grapefruit pot.
3485580	3486820	I just have it in me yard.
3486820	3488500	That was a joke, Dorothy.
3488500	3489660	Just a joke.
3489660	3490500	Okay.
3491500	3492940	Will you leave?
3492940	3494780	Yeah.
3494780	3496660	Should we go to the crystal store?
3496660	3499260	Should we go to the, the doc's house?
3499260	3501940	Well, there's also Tri-gate supply.
3501940	3503460	That is also true.
3503460	3504300	Good thinking.
3504300	3507740	Plus this map we got with this space needle.
3507740	3509580	It's abandoned.
3509580	3512700	It does seem like his search was concentrated
3512700	3514260	within that area exactly.
3514260	3516060	Perhaps we would find more there.
3516060	3517900	Is any of that stuff near his house?
3517900	3518980	Oh yeah.
3520220	3521060	Oh yeah.
3521060	3522140	Oh yeah.
3522140	3523100	For sure.
3523100	3525820	People don't go too far out their neighborhood
3525820	3528060	here in the city, or at least Dr. Brock Hargrave
3528060	3531260	seems to stay within his area around his house.
3531260	3533380	I also have a close personal relationship
3533380	3535540	with Aaron Strummer so I could give him a call
3535540	3537340	while we're on our way to another site.
3537340	3539100	All right, let's check out the house first
3539100	3541780	and you call this Aaron boy.
3541780	3544660	He is an Aaron boy of sorts, yes.
3544660	3547500	Now doc, you be real cool when you call him.
3547500	3550300	Don't get on a rant about Hargrave.
3550300	3553300	Don't talk about how he's been seen shopping around
3553300	3556100	where you shop, or do, but just don't,
3556100	3556940	don't get angry about it.
3556940	3558780	I was gonna say that's kind of my inroad.
3558780	3561380	Yeah, that is the entire line of questioning, I understand.
3561380	3563060	Do you have any of these crystals you can maybe
3563060	3565340	put your bad negative energy into
3565340	3566820	before you give him a call?
3566820	3569220	Yeah, if any of your crystals have been charging.
3569220	3571220	Oh, I always have them charging
3571220	3574260	at least when the phase of the moon aligns, of course.
3574260	3576500	I wouldn't charge a lapis lazuli
3576500	3578860	on a waxing crescent, of course.
3578860	3580700	No, that'd be stupid.
3580700	3584020	Ridiculous, but I do have this tiger's eye here
3584020	3586820	and it is charged.
3586820	3589540	I'd say this is the prime time to be using that.
3589540	3591860	Wait a minute, doc, has he ever met Craig?
3593180	3595980	He has not met Craig Mile, no.
3595980	3600060	Perhaps Craig could call as a potential customer.
3600060	3601500	That's a great idea.
3601500	3603380	A career-defining performance, yes.
3606020	3608060	It's gonna be tough, doc, but I know you can do it.
3608060	3609500	You're a real artist with those things,
3609500	3612020	no matter how much they get in the way on the missions.
3612980	3616820	I'll do this, but in the meantime,
3616820	3619180	we are on our way to Hargrave's home.
3619180	3621540	Is that what we decided, or was it the Space Needle?
3621540	3622620	Hargrave's home.
3622620	3624300	I see the Space Needle is kind of
3624300	3626740	potentially an epic conclusion.
3626740	3627580	Yeah.
3629340	3631940	It seems like a very dramatic location.
3631940	3634500	Then yeah, so that's on our way then.
3634500	3635660	Boing, boing.
3637620	3642220	Strummer's Crystals, this is Arren speaking.
3642220	3643060	Arren?
3643060	3645100	Hello, hello Arren.
3645100	3647140	Yes, no, this is Arren.
3647140	3652140	Arren, this is a friend of Mr. St. Blythe.
3652580	3653860	He told me to call you.
3653860	3657300	Oh yes, that adds up.
3657300	3662300	Mr. St. Blythe always calls me Arren.
3665900	3669260	He's a bit of a, you know.
3669260	3671700	And St. Blythe is giving big eyes to everybody in the car.
3671700	3672820	Am I on the right track?
3672820	3673660	Just keep going, just keep going.
3673660	3674820	Thumbs up, all right.
3674820	3675980	You are the puppet.
3675980	3679900	You might have gotten me confused with my brother Arren.
3679900	3683620	Oh, either one I think works if your last name is
3684220	3685060	Strummer.
3685060	3686860	Strummer, and that's the name on the door, right?
3686860	3688260	That's the one, yes.
3688260	3691260	Arren Strummer's Resonating Crystals,
3691260	3692940	though it doesn't say Arren,
3692940	3695660	just says Strummer's Resonating Crystals above the door
3695660	3698300	and on all of my marketing.
3698300	3702580	But you see, I'm a mutual friend there of Mr. St. Blythe
3702580	3705340	and one Brock Hargrave.
3705340	3710020	And we were trying to discern if he's been in lately.
3710020	3710980	What was the name?
3710980	3712620	I'm not supposed to say these kinds of things,
3712620	3716700	but I love tea, so spill it if you must.
3716700	3720180	It's Brock Hargrave.
3720180	3724100	Brock Hargrave, let me look through.
3724100	3728780	No, no, I'm not seeing this name anywhere on my list.
3731940	3733940	Ask him if anything's gone missing lately.
3733940	3735740	Have you had anything, you know,
3735740	3739500	that of maybe great value or historical significance
3739500	3740460	go missing lately?
3740460	3743100	Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, go Craig, go Craig.
3743100	3744780	I mean, that's something,
3744780	3746980	that sounds like something that, you know,
3746980	3748700	St. Blythe would say, right?
3748700	3749620	Oh, disguise.
3749620	3753300	Also, I want the two criminals
3753300	3755660	and the mercenary to roll criminology.
3755660	3758100	I would like to roll my puppet skill, thank you.
3758100	3759940	Yes, please roll your puppet skill.
3762220	3763700	Oh, fuck.
3763700	3765900	I got a seven.
3765900	3767980	That's definitely a pass. Oh, fuck yeah, nice.
3767980	3770300	I fail a 49 on a 40 puppetry.
3771060	3773220	Damn, we probably shouldn't have done a FaceTime.
3776220	3778060	I failed my criminology roll.
3778060	3780260	He's made the puppet hang up.
3780260	3781900	Yeah, I failed my criminology roll too.
3781900	3783300	I guess take off your headphones,
3783300	3784940	the three of you that are in the room.
3784940	3789020	And Becca, since you succeeded on your criminology check,
3789020	3791420	this is knowledge that will just be for you.
3791420	3793340	Oh, I get a secret.
3793340	3795220	Wait, you're in the same room?
3795220	3796820	They're all doing this thing
3796820	3798500	where they put their fingers in their ears
3798500	3801980	and then rub them around to make the consistent noise
3801980	3803780	to not hear my voice.
3803780	3805020	Excellent.
3805020	3807380	It also hurts their ears the longer we talk.
3809860	3812380	So, Becca, it actually makes a ton of sense
3812380	3816500	that me hook would know Aaron Strummer,
3816500	3819220	which is Aaron Strummer's brother.
3819220	3823980	And Aaron Strummer isn't a purveyor of crystals
3823980	3825500	at the resonating crystal shop.
3825500	3828820	He is a seller of crystal methamphetamine.
3828820	3831500	Yeah, I know a guy.
3831500	3833140	I know, yeah, I know that guy.
3833140	3834340	That's the guy that I know.
3834340	3836100	Yep, that's the guy that you know.
3836100	3837660	And this kind of comes to you
3837660	3840300	as this conversation is happening on the phone.
3840300	3845300	Not for me, but many people at the hold
3845420	3847300	know a thing about that.
3847300	3852300	So, who is this that I'm speaking to then?
3852460	3854420	It's Craig Mile.
3854420	3859420	Yeah, are you sure this isn't some sort of
3859420	3864100	crystalline knowledgeable man,
3864100	3866700	some sort of client of mine?
3866700	3869260	Ask him where his brother is.
3869260	3872580	I was wondering if I could speak to your brother.
3873700	3876620	Aaron, let me see if he's here.
3876620	3878260	Oh, Aaron.
3878260	3882380	Let me remind you, it's like 9.45 p.m. now at night
3882380	3884660	and you called the crystal shop.
3884660	3886260	That's like their busiest hour.
3890020	3891700	Oh yes, all right, he'll be here.
3891700	3894020	Yes, he's coming, he's coming.
3894020	3895580	Hey y'all, who is this?
3895580	3898380	Oh, it's Aaron, is it?
3898380	3900140	Yes, Aaron, who called for me?
3900140	3902540	I think you should give me the phone, actually.
3903900	3906100	I've got someone here who would like to speak to you.
3906100	3908340	It's, hang on.
3908340	3910060	He can see me, it's FaceTime.
3910580	3913940	Yeah, you just hold the phone right there, doc.
3913940	3916140	Is that, is this?
3916140	3918780	You know me, Stromer, but don't say my name.
3918780	3922180	Oh, nice, intimidation over FaceTime.
3922180	3924020	Immediately though, like, okay.
3924020	3925100	You owe me a favor.
3925100	3927820	Oh, okay, like I owe you a favor after the last time?
3927820	3930620	Yeah, that wasn't my fault while we went down.
3930620	3933580	Yeah, telling me that that little fish fella of yours
3933580	3935700	isn't still hanging about?
3935700	3936780	You're not still protecting him?
3936780	3938580	Yeah, we scoot him out of the frame.
3940740	3941980	Fish face?
3941980	3943820	Fish face, shut your fucking mouth.
3943820	3944860	Fish face.
3944860	3946220	Haven't seen him.
3946220	3948860	Don't know anything about his whereabouts.
3948860	3950620	He's not at the hold, that's for sure.
3950620	3952340	But you know who is?
3952340	3954300	A lot of your former clients.
3954300	3956100	Yeah, so what, what's it to you?
3956100	3961020	All they need is one rock slipped in their water
3961020	3964220	and they'll be back on the choo-choo train.
3964220	3965300	You know what I mean?
3966140	3968140	Yes, I understand what you mean.
3968140	3969580	What do you want?
3969660	3974660	I wanna know what you know about Dr. Brock Hargrave,
3976060	3978460	cause he had some questions for you.
3978460	3980140	Questions like, can he get some more?
3980140	3980980	What do you want?
3980980	3983340	He's trying to get some crystal.
3983340	3984420	I don't know what you want.
3984420	3987260	Dr. Brock Hargrave is on the crystal?
3987260	3988220	Why wouldn't he be?
3989340	3991460	Yeah, no, I guess we are in the city.
3991460	3993860	Oh, you think my crystal's not good enough for a doctor?
3993860	3994900	Should've known better.
3994900	3997140	Took me a while to kick the habit.
3997140	4002140	Why would it be any different for some hob-nosing jungle
4002420	4007420	seeking cat piss smelling cowboy hat wearing guy?
4008180	4009580	Well, if he smells like cat piss,
4009580	4011220	he's probably, you know, I don't know.
4011220	4013860	Maybe that's why he hasn't made another order in a while.
4013860	4015500	Trying to make his own.
4015500	4019860	Okay, well maybe tell me when the last order he got was.
4019860	4021580	I don't know, like two weeks ago.
4021580	4024740	Weeks, hmm, okay.
4025740	4027220	Doesn't help me, man.
4027220	4028420	Doesn't help me.
4028420	4030300	Y'all got any questions for this fella?
4030300	4032180	I turn the camera around.
4032180	4033940	This is everybody in our car, by the way,
4033940	4036860	in case, don't tell anybody what the place guys call me.
4036860	4037700	Hello.
4037700	4039420	Hey, it sounds like you guys are still here.
4039420	4041500	I'm Jimmy Corrigan, this is Dr. Shelley,
4041500	4042980	and this is Craig.
4042980	4046180	There's also a mob man whose name keeps changing.
4047380	4050460	It's been Vincente the almost the whole time.
4050460	4051900	Nearly the whole time, but.
4051900	4053140	Nearly the whole time.
4053180	4055780	It sounds like maybe you're selling drugs in my city.
4056900	4059580	Yeah, are you selling crystals or crystal?
4059580	4062020	I think you want to talk to my brother, Oren, maybe.
4062020	4063020	He sells crystals.
4063020	4063860	Yeah, but.
4063860	4065300	And you sell crystal methamphetamine.
4065300	4066740	But that was a different conversation
4066740	4069780	I was trying to have with, you know,
4069780	4070660	I'm not gonna say a name.
4070660	4072860	I picked up on it pretty fucking quick,
4072860	4075860	and we're gonna have to have a separate conversation
4075860	4079540	outside of this because either I get a cut or you get cut.
4079540	4080820	That seems fair.
4080820	4085300	His eyes get pretty big and he's like, good to know.
4085300	4086140	Good to know.
4086140	4087140	I will be in touch.
4087140	4087980	So you've been, what?
4087980	4090460	You've been selling this shit to Hargrave?
4090460	4091900	Yeah, so what?
4091900	4093700	A perversion of crystals.
4095260	4097820	Aaron, I think you need to tell people around town
4097820	4101980	that Meat Hook is in with some classy folks now.
4101980	4105620	I got shackles on my shoes or whatever she said.
4105620	4107380	Yeah, you can see.
4107380	4109580	We're a classy bunch.
4109580	4112900	And if you keep selling, to our friend Meat Hook.
4114900	4116660	You're gonna what?
4116660	4117580	Hurt you.
4118500	4119820	You look like a scary guy.
4120900	4122620	So I'm not gonna mess with you, okay?
4122620	4123820	I'm not gonna mess.
4123820	4124980	In fact, I'll stop.
4124980	4127820	I'll stop selling drugs.
4127820	4130540	I don't know, it sounds like maybe we could benefit
4130540	4131380	from each other.
4131380	4132300	I'll call you later.
4134020	4134980	You don't have to stop.
4134980	4136820	You just gotta cut me in on it.
4136820	4138900	I'll just keep doing what I'm doing and we'll talk later.
4138900	4141900	Does he like to do drugs up in a tall tower?
4141900	4143700	Does he like to do drugs up in a tall,
4143700	4145780	I don't know what you're talking, I mean,
4145780	4148260	oh, you're talking about his, the zeitgeist?
4148260	4149100	You ever go to the zeitgeist?
4149100	4151660	His crazy, yeah, where he's doing all the digging.
4151660	4152500	Yeah.
4152500	4154660	He's doing digging in a tower in the sky?
4154660	4157100	He's got my children digging at the zeitgeist.
4159980	4161860	I don't know, last time I went out there,
4161860	4164140	I was like trying to maybe, you know,
4164580	4168820	boom, just be a good fella and drive it out to him,
4168820	4172820	you know, and I happened to see what he was doing out there,
4172820	4174940	doing some digging with his sharp shovel.
4174940	4176580	By the space needle?
4176580	4178620	Yeah, you know, zeitgeist.
4178620	4180500	Sharp shovel, doc, it sounds like him.
4180500	4182980	It's a telltale sign, he never leaves home without it.
4182980	4184780	Would Vincente know if there's a,
4184780	4186820	like a telescope in this tower?
4186820	4187660	Oh yeah, there's definitely a telescope in this tower.
4187660	4190020	Yeah, he really fucking wants to go there now.
4190020	4194540	Let's go see where he's been doing his ground fucking.
4220020	4221180	Is it just food?
4250020	4254020	All my muscles work like swims
4280020	4282020	Is it just food?
