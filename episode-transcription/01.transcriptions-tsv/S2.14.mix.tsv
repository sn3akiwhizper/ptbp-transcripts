0	4920	What's good, people of the internet and the radio waves
4920	9220	and other people that I throw my sounds at on accident
9220	12620	through my vibrations and gyrations.
12620	17280	It's your sound wave sommelier, Wolf the dog.
17280	21280	I'm thrashing about live from 694.2 PTBP,
22960	27960	the most beloved radio station this side of the Milky Way.
28200	31360	Give me a scoop of that space cream.
31360	34360	And now, speaking of you all loving me,
34360	37760	today's Howlin' with Wolf is from Mistress Yachty,
37760	41440	who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.
41440	44760	Did you know both thumbs are explicitly built
44760	48600	to tweet about this show and tag at Pretending Pod?
48600	52080	Mistress Yachty knows, they write.
52080	55600	Good morrow, Wolfie, how fair ye.
55620	58320	I have stumbled upon a strange box
58320	60520	in the cellar of Duke Arthur,
60520	63680	out of which your lovely voice comes.
63680	65600	Quite strange indeed.
65600	69680	Nonetheless, your so-called cast of broads
69680	72940	is very entertaining while I weave blankets
72940	74480	for the coming winter.
74480	76780	I pray you are not one of the wolves
76780	80320	that come to prey on us in our dark days.
80320	83680	Cordially, Mistress Yachty.
83720	86800	Well, Mistress Yachty, I cannot guarantee
86800	91460	that I won't join some of those feral pups out on a hunt.
91460	96240	It brings me back to my less omniscient days.
96240	100120	But whether or not I devour you this coming winter,
100120	103000	I'm still glad you wrote in to us.
103000	106380	Toodles, Mistress Yachty, for now.
106380	109200	If you wanna write up something for your wolf to howl,
109200	111080	be like Mistress Yachty.
111120	114280	Tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram,
114280	116760	tag pretending to be people on Facebook,
116760	120520	or write a five-star review on your podcast app of choice
120520	122200	and holler about it.

161600	165680	And if anyone asks why you just said that out loud
165680	170680	to no one in particular, tell them it's time for the news.
170720	174920	Last time, the can crew was arrested
174920	178600	for the murder of the mayor of Grover's Gorge,
178600	180560	Sandro the Turtle.
180560	183840	With the trial in the gang's immediate future,
183840	186600	Vernon Covington, the landlord,
186600	189560	led the cuffed crew to the It Pit,
189560	193640	a horrible underground holding cell filled with a few inches
193640	198640	of bodily fluid mud and a specifically strange symbol
198640	202840	scrawled ceaselessly on its dimly lit walls.
202840	205360	As Vernon Covington pushed the party
205360	208120	through the open metal cellar doors,
208120	212360	Cal Colorado was able to pull the landlord along
212360	214840	down into the awful mess.
214840	218480	There, the city action news team attacked,
218480	223480	leaving their foe face down and still in the yucky yuck.
223680	225400	Of the It Pit.
225400	229240	Taking us now to that terrible scene.
229240	234240	It's Altagirl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.
234960	238800	And it's all my fault
238800	243800	Cause my life is great
243800	245800	And it's all mine
245800	250800	Cause my life is great
250800	255800	And it's all my fault
275800	280800	I love being in all the blood and cum.
296640	299360	So you guys have had a week to look over this symbol.
299360	300560	What do you make of it?
300560	305560	It looks like whoever drew it talks like this
306560	308200	and needs serious help.
309440	312120	This came out of the mind of a very disturbed child.
314320	316160	I was just going through some like old notebooks
316160	317920	from when I was a kid and came across this
317920	319480	and was like season two, baby.
319480	323680	That would be a great like a tagline for this podcast.
323680	324720	Made by her.
324720	327520	This came out of the mind of a very disturbed child.
328520	330480	I might've turned 30 this year, but I take it.
330480	331480	You're still a baby.
331480	336200	That's why I make a pretend to be people with my friends.
336200	337720	Like Thomas.
337720	340720	Thomas loves you when I talk like this.
343880	347520	Zach, I don't, but I love you.
347520	352520	Today at work I had to write an email
358360	360400	that was all about rum
360400	364600	and I just couldn't stop making cum jokes.
364600	366120	And everyone clapped.
368240	369080	It's crazy.
369080	372520	They all stood up and cheered for me.
372520	376000	They chanted, cum, cum, cum, cum.
376040	379480	I had some of the copy that I wasn't gonna put in there
379480	381520	was young, dumb and full of rum.
381520	383600	And she's like, that is so gross.
383600	385920	What about like rum in my mouth?
385920	387080	Yeah, that's actually good.
387080	390040	Rum in my mouth is also great.
390040	391760	I thought you meant like you made a movie poster
391760	393640	for the cum diary.
393640	395040	Nice.
395040	398640	Yeah, I really thought you were switching rum to cum.
398640	401160	Cum with rum, which is a little cheekier.
401160	402840	Cum tug tugger.
402840	403680	There's something there.
403760	404600	Yeah, cum.
407480	410920	It's cumbling outside, like rumbling.
412840	413960	Okay, let's play.
413960	414800	Classic.
415800	417720	That's how it's pretending to be people.
417720	419320	The vape hit in the background.
420240	421920	I was gonna point out on this symbol
421920	424120	that you mentioned that this was a hammer.
424120	427760	I think that could also be like a lectern
427760	429000	or like a music stadium.
429000	429840	I like that, yeah.
429840	430840	But it could be a hammer too,
430840	432640	especially with the square up there.
432640	434920	It just looked more like that than an upside down cross,
434920	435760	which is literally one of the examples.
435760	439120	Or if you zoom in, it's a basketball goal.
439120	439960	Yeah.
439960	440800	Because there's a little hoop.
440800	442480	I don't think there's any use in trying
442480	447120	to put any meaning into this fucking stupid scribblings.
447120	449200	I like to think the episode starts with the four,
449200	450720	no, you said stupid scribblings.
450720	452720	I like the episode starting with the four of you.
452720	455040	That's not the part I don't say about.
455040	457440	Just standing, like the episode starts with the four
457440	461200	of you just standing there, staring at the wall.
461240	464440	Beck, do you think it looks a little bit
464440	466480	like a basketball goal?
466480	468160	Ah, yeah, dude.
468160	469960	I like to think of it as a hammer.
469960	472680	It could be also like a music stand
472680	474560	or like, I don't know, man.
474560	476560	I think we almost killed a guy just a second ago.
476560	479000	Yeah, I enjoy looking at shapes and clouds,
479000	481840	but this is neither the time nor place.
481840	483800	Like I was seeing red for a second there, guys.
483800	486240	I'm sorry I lost my cool dudes.
486240	489480	I'm sorry I couldn't help.
489480	494000	I went somewhere else when I got in this pit.
494000	495720	Maybe I'm getting too old for this.
495720	496800	Where did you go?
496800	498160	In my mine palace.
498160	499480	Oh, what's that?
499480	500520	Don't you have one?
500520	503080	Mine's a tree house in the woods.
503080	505760	I have a real palace, but I mean,
505760	507920	it's just like a big house, I guess, like an estate,
507920	509960	but you have one in your mind?
509960	513520	Do you know how to get out of the pit?
513520	516280	She looks up and one of the doors is open
516280	521040	and she's like, well, they do normally keep that shut.
521040	523200	So there's potential here.
523200	525080	I sort of have an idea about that.
525080	526000	Okay.
526000	530480	We need to get them here, at least in my plan.
530480	532800	We should probably vote on it, talk it over.
532800	536240	I was thinking I got that clicker
536240	538680	that opens all the windows in that place.
538680	541480	Is there a clicker for these handcuffs?
541480	544280	Well, we should probably search this corpse, right?
544280	545320	Not corpse, but-
545320	546360	Almost lifeless body.
546360	547680	But this shell, yeah.
547680	549240	This shell of a human.
549240	551720	Yeah, and because Julius Summers
551720	553160	has his hands in front of him,
553160	558160	he's pretty easily able to go through and find a key
558200	560960	to unlock all of your handcuffs.
560960	562480	I use it.
562480	564680	Thank you, Julius, for setting us free.
564680	566440	Now here's my proposition.
566440	567760	Oh, that feels so much better.
567760	568840	Okay, yeah, what's up?
568840	571600	Stevie, we'll need your blessing for this,
571640	575600	but what if we just scream and yell for help?
575600	577240	Say he attacked us
577240	580800	and tried to put Faith Godel in the it pit.
580800	585800	Yeah, I mean, I don't wanna be stoned to death, so-
586160	590400	Would you not be hailed as a leader of the people?
590400	591220	I was gonna mention,
591220	593440	it seemed like you even had maybe a vendetta
593440	594360	against this guy.
594360	596560	There may be like other people who feel that way,
596560	598200	and this is gonna be like a,
598280	601440	hail Godel, the wicked landlord is dead situation.
601440	605160	Whoa, I didn't even think of-
605160	608120	Yes, a Godel come back to the people to save them
608120	611040	from the grip of the horrid landlord.
611040	613360	Okay, but I've been missing for a year.
613360	615040	Does that mean that they would assume
615040	616920	that I was down here the whole time?
616920	618720	We could use that?
618720	620520	I don't think so.
620520	621520	Everyone saw you.
621520	622520	Oh, right, duh.
622520	624280	Oh, shit, yeah, that's my bad.
624280	625640	That's true, Cal, yeah.
625640	626480	I think we-
626600	627440	I swear.
629520	631680	Wait, no, but they saw Stevie.
631680	633440	They didn't see Faith.
633440	635440	The problem is you look very similar.
635440	637280	Wait, hang on, like let your hair down.
637280	639400	Let's see if like you're a totally different person.
639400	641360	Yeah, take your glasses off.
641360	642920	Boing, boing, boing, boing.
644720	646320	Classic 90s rom-com.
646320	648160	Julius, put your boner away.
648160	650120	Now that his hands are free, he does.
652120	654520	Yeah, his pants got ripped open in a fight,
654520	655680	so he tucks it back in.
656600	659680	How far down did we fall into this pit?
659680	662760	That's a great, I was wondering that the whole time.
662760	664880	Is this like just deep enough
664880	667760	that we couldn't quite reach the top or?
667760	669760	No, I think it's 10 feet.
669760	670680	Oh, we could just-
670680	671520	We can just climb out.
671520	672360	Force ourselves out.
672360	673960	We need no subterfuge.
673960	677400	I've got the strongest base.
677400	680240	You guys could just hop off my shoulders.
680240	683080	That's true, you're like a mighty tripod.
684120	686120	Or do you wanna like continue with your plan though
686640	688880	and like it makes it look like we're like hapless
688880	690760	and don't wanna be.
690760	693320	Oh, I think it's still a good idea,
693320	695320	but it wouldn't be necessary for our escape.
695320	697680	Right, I'm saying like should we wait in this hole
697680	699280	for people to see us in this hole
699280	701800	and that we didn't like run away when they-
701800	703160	Oh yes, and then in that case,
703160	704440	we should scream and call for help
704440	705920	because I don't want to wait in this hole
705920	707120	any longer than I have to.
707120	711560	Just a counter argument, what if they don't care?
711560	714040	That is, I mean, yeah, that's kind of in Stevie's court.
714040	715840	Like how do you think this plan works?
716440	718800	On like a scale of one to 10?
718800	721520	Yeah, I'd call it a coin flip, honestly.
721520	723200	The alternative is they come back
723200	725520	and find us with our jailer.
725520	727720	Right, they're gonna see us like this either way.
727720	729920	I think we need a good cover story.
729920	732680	On a scale from one to 10, a coin flip is a five, just-
732680	734720	That's good to know for the future.
734720	735960	I don't like Zach's dick.
735960	739400	Do I have like, do I have my phone on me?
739400	740240	Yeah.
740240	743040	While we're just like talking about this,
743040	745160	Julius gets his phone out and turns the flashlight on
745320	747480	and looks at what's actually down here
747480	749120	that we couldn't see before.
749120	750440	How big a room are we in?
752600	754640	Do you want it in meters or yards?
755920	758160	How many of my arm spans would it take
758160	759480	to hit the next wall?
759480	762780	Oh, probably like 10.
762780	763620	Holy shit.
763620	765320	Yeah, like 20 yards by 20 yards-ish.
765320	767560	How many Volvos could you fit in this bag, boy?
767560	768400	Oh.
768400	769220	Like the station wagon.
769220	770760	Probably four.
770760	774020	Yeah, easily six, probably six, yeah.
775020	777700	Like all standing, like car edge style.
777700	778540	Car nose down.
778540	779940	Like car sardines, yeah.
779940	782140	Yeah, you could really shove more in there, huh?
783660	786300	After Julius kinda like flashes his flashlight
786300	789980	around a little bit, he is kind of like pushing Cal
789980	793540	to stand in front of one of these symbols
793540	797100	and he like flips over to TikTok.
800500	802660	Cal, do you wanna just,
802700	804700	I could just get like a still image
804700	806220	to put in the TikTok later
806220	809360	or do you wanna describe anything?
809360	813980	No, and Cal like leans down to help lift Stevie Gotel's foot
813980	814860	up over the pit.
814860	817900	I get that with the symbol in the background.
819420	820740	I know we're in like viscera,
820740	824220	but is there any remains that are more intact around here?
824220	825900	Is there anybody else in here?
825900	828720	Is this a pit that's been holding other prisoners?
828720	830860	So there's like 40 other, no.
831580	832420	There's no one else down here.
832420	834440	They were all cheering wildly.
835540	839340	Priti Press, Priti Press, Priti Press.
842260	843420	Oh, hey guys.
843420	844800	No, there's no one else down here.
844800	846500	And really with the viscera,
846500	851020	it's more of a leftovers kind of situation down here.
851020	853220	Great show, great show.
853220	855860	Just a lot of hot shirtless dudes on the cover
856980	858700	of down here, what?
858700	860740	You never watched the leftovers, did you?
861860	863300	Oh, I'm thinking of left behind.
863300	865060	Nick Cage right there on the front.
867800	868880	Nope, I didn't.
870620	871620	There's like, there's no-
871620	872460	Well, you nailed it.
872460	873620	It's hot shirtless dudes.
877220	878180	God's jealous.
878180	879580	He left them all behind.
881060	883420	You guys are looking around
883420	888420	and there are no like intact human bodies down here,
888460	893460	but there are seemingly pieces of body parts down here.
894400	897300	And as you pick through, you also,
897300	898140	I mean, if you're,
898140	900620	are you like picking through at this point or?
900620	904020	No, I was kind of looking for bodies that had clothing
904020	907700	and doing a like red or a yellow versus green kind of thing.
907700	908660	Oh, okay, yeah, cool.
908660	910120	Everybody roll search.
915220	916740	40 on a 70, pass.
916740	919820	I pass my search with a 26 on a 40.
919820	920660	Cool.
920660	921780	Cal passes with a nine.
921780	923180	Three passes.
923180	924920	Three pieces of information.
926740	927580	One.
929060	930660	Oh, we can't just make them up.
930660	931500	Julius.
932500	934020	Yeah, you each write down three things
934020	936820	and we'll decide which of the six are the best.
936820	937660	Yeah.
937660	938860	Yeah, so as Julius is like,
938860	942020	basically just like getting a full TikTok film
942020	945520	of what's all in here and then he stumbles on.
945520	947000	It's like a ear.
947000	948180	It's like a weird,
949320	954040	it's like a, oh, it's not a human ear though.
954040	959040	And it seems to have fur on the outside of it.
959960	962440	That doesn't quite narrow it down.
962440	964720	Does it, it's human ear shaped?
964720	969720	No, it is shaped like a dog or a wolf's ear
969860	973760	and it has been severed from the head that it was on
973760	977200	and it's kind of sticking out from within this
977200	981360	just layer of disgusting gloop that's down here.
981360	984360	And Beck Wilder, as you're going through,
984360	987560	just kind of looking around with your cell phone light,
987560	988380	you see that.
988380	989880	Or maybe the light on his camera
989880	992160	that he's whipped out at this point.
992160	993000	They took the camera away from him?
993000	993840	They took the camera away from him.
993840	994660	Oh no.
994660	995500	Remember they put it in a bag.
995500	996340	It's the worst anyway.
996340	999160	Right, in my mind the bag was on his back for some reason.
1000520	1003440	The camera bag was in Vernon Covington's possession
1004080	1006200	and so it is just right above you.
1006200	1007040	Outside of.
1007040	1007880	Like he set it down outside the doors.
1007880	1010400	He set it down outside the stores that he came down.
1010400	1011440	Fucked with some prisoners.
1011440	1012600	Oh, okay.
1012600	1013840	So it's just right up there.
1013840	1014680	I'm glad that.
1014680	1015520	You can smell it, Beck.
1015520	1018640	Fucker is, he's not quite dead.
1018640	1019600	Mostly dead.
1019600	1020560	Yeah, we'll see.
1020560	1023000	Yeah, we just left him face down in this muck, right?
1023000	1024280	Face up, but pretty rough.
1024280	1026600	Face up in the muck.
1026600	1028120	I turn him face down.
1028120	1030880	He says nothing at all.
1030880	1032640	He's almost dead.
1032680	1035960	He can't even freaking talk.
1037040	1037880	One day.
1039960	1041880	Little red jumpsuit apparatus just for Thomas.
1041880	1044760	And so you see Beck Wilder,
1044760	1049560	a piece of cloth actually sticking up out of the muck here.
1049560	1054560	And as you grab it, it seems to be some sort of like,
1055980	1058400	yeah, it's a jumpsuit and it's.
1058400	1059240	Is it red?
1059240	1060080	It's red.
1060080	1061400	Monochromatic.
1061480	1063080	Oh, holy shit.
1063080	1063920	Damn.
1065440	1067960	Your brain just made a connection on accident.
1067960	1070160	I wish, but it's not.
1072120	1074720	It is a monochromatic jumpsuit.
1074720	1075560	We went over this.
1075560	1077480	It's a gray scale jumpsuit, but.
1077480	1078720	Also not quite the word, but better.
1078720	1081600	It's almost a gray scale jumpsuit.
1081600	1084200	It's a gray jumpsuit with a color like a stripe.
1084200	1085160	Purple.
1085160	1086600	Oh shit, it's purple.
1092400	1093920	A third color.
1093920	1095760	And anyone.
1095760	1097560	Cal vomits like in suspense.
1099000	1100800	Anyone who's either one of you.
1100800	1101760	I got it in my notes.
1101760	1104600	The purple Jackalope, purple ribbon Jackalope Fox
1104600	1106960	removed it from that Jackalope and walked away.
1106960	1108860	We weren't supposed to see the purple ribbon.
1108860	1110400	Dang straight.
1110400	1113040	That Jackalope was supposed to die in this pit.
1116500	1119160	Hey dude, you remember that second Jackalope we saw?
1119160	1121360	It had a purple ribbon just like this.
1122320	1124040	And that Fox dude like took it off.
1124040	1125840	He was condemned to death,
1125840	1128280	perhaps for killing a frog comptroller.
1129640	1130600	That was a joke.
1137320	1140400	Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got it.
1140400	1141240	That was good.
1142160	1143000	Thank you, Stevie.
1143000	1144600	Yeah, that was solid.
1144600	1147760	Stevie, what does the purple mean?
1147760	1150840	This is where they kept,
1150840	1154080	I guess they kept, I was expecting this place to be full.
1155160	1157160	This is where they kept the twenties.
1157160	1158560	The twenties?
1158560	1159760	Yeah, it's what they call them.
1159760	1163040	But yeah, everyone just kind of referred to them
1163040	1164800	as the twenties.
1164800	1166120	Did they have...
1166120	1166960	Meaning what?
1166960	1168240	Furry ears?
1168240	1173240	No, I have absolutely no idea what that's about.
1173400	1174880	That's really strange.
1174880	1179880	And as she says that, Cal, you find the matching ear.
1180240	1184600	So it's like the other ear from the one that Julius found.
1184600	1187400	And do any of you have like biology, any science,
1187400	1189560	any animal knowledge?
1189560	1193360	If not, I'll take a intelligence at like a negative 20.
1193360	1194320	I'll try that.
1194320	1195160	I'll try that too.
1195160	1197720	Cal holds the ear up close to his face
1197720	1202020	and peers into it for some whisper of its secrets.
1203120	1204000	And fails.
1204000	1205800	He drops the ear back into the book.
1207120	1208080	You said a negative 20?
1208080	1208920	Yeah.
1208960	1211040	That's a 49 on what would be a 50.
1211040	1211880	Nice.
1211880	1214160	I got a 91, so I don't win.
1214160	1215960	So they're holding up these things
1215960	1217160	and you walk up with the...
1217160	1218640	I hold the ribbon between them.
1218640	1219880	Uh-huh.
1219880	1222240	You like pop up your head in between them
1222240	1223480	and put them on either side of you.
1223480	1225640	And yeah, when Beck pops up his head,
1227040	1231000	it's very clear that, yeah, it seems to...
1231000	1234700	It's like fox ears, but they're bigger.
1236520	1238500	Yeah, like they are the ears of a fox,
1238940	1241220	but it would be a massive fox.
1241220	1243220	So you're just really leaning in
1243220	1245400	for the furry demographic this season.
1245400	1246320	Always have been.
1248380	1251020	We got fox people, folks.
1251020	1252100	It's dead.
1252100	1252940	Oh, duh.
1253900	1255540	Yeah, that's why we have its ears.
1257380	1259460	Okay, actually, because all three of you
1259460	1261180	succeeded on your rolls,
1261180	1263140	I'm gonna go ahead and give you one final thing.
1263140	1266180	So Cal, yeah, right?
1266180	1268420	Yeah, a little extra, yeah.
1269260	1270660	Because I thought of something.
1272660	1277660	Cal, with the detached fox ear in one hand,
1278740	1279860	as you pulled it out,
1279860	1283820	you see that there's actually a small piece of paper
1283820	1285540	sticking up out of this muck
1285540	1288040	where it had clearly been buried
1288040	1289540	and you might not have even found it
1289540	1292580	if you hadn't gotten the second ear,
1292580	1295620	but underneath you see this little bit
1295620	1297060	of paper sticking out.
1297060	1299220	Guys, look, paper.
1299220	1301620	I look to see what's on the paper.
1301620	1302460	No, you don't.
1302460	1303540	I'm standing right over it.
1304860	1306100	I just called your attention to it.
1306100	1306920	Yeah.
1306920	1307760	Shut the fuck up.
1307760	1308780	This is my paper.
1308780	1310540	I'm looking at it.
1310540	1312860	From across the room, Julius stares.
1312860	1314000	I dive for the paper.
1315140	1316580	I kick back in the jaw.
1323700	1324780	I read the paper.
1324780	1326940	Yeah, as you pick it up,
1327780	1330060	you're gonna have to kind of get some of the muck
1330060	1332180	and gunk off of it.
1332180	1333000	Julius, come here.
1333000	1334460	Read this nasty paper for me.
1335980	1338900	Yeah, I go over and I try to read it
1338900	1340520	after I scraped some muck off.
1340520	1342260	It's like a small business card
1342260	1345460	in the shape of a big guitar pick.
1345460	1347860	And it says the occult
1347860	1352020	and unnatural investigative journalism association.
1352020	1355780	Shout out to Intrepid T over on Discord,
1355780	1358420	one of our $10 and up patrons
1358420	1361100	over at patreon.com slash pretending pod
1361100	1363340	for giving us the occult
1363340	1367020	and unnatural investigative journalism association.
1367020	1367860	Dope.
1367860	1368840	What do you think about that, Cal?
1368840	1370440	Ouija.
1370440	1371280	What?
1371280	1372480	Ouija.
1372480	1374360	O-U-I-J-A.
1375300	1377700	No, that obviously spells Ouija.
1377700	1378540	Oh, yeah.
1379740	1381060	It can't be Ouija.
1381060	1382740	Before I put it together in my head,
1382740	1384380	I was like, oh, it doesn't mean anything.
1384380	1385220	So it'd be funny to say like,
1385580	1386420	Ouija.
1386420	1387240	O-U-I-J-A.
1387240	1389080	O-U-I-J-A.
1389080	1390020	And I'm like, wait.
1390020	1391820	Do you think that Intrepid T
1391820	1394140	knew what they were doing when they wrote this?
1394140	1394960	Nope.
1394960	1395800	One of our listeners.
1395800	1396640	He looked into that.
1396640	1398100	Yeah, undoubtedly not.
1398100	1399940	A Bob Ross situation.
1399940	1402300	It's so wild he picked out that collection of words.
1402300	1403340	Did he even know?
1405000	1407940	Oh shit, this is not my, this campaign note.
1407940	1411700	This is our original campaign notebook full of notes.
1411700	1413440	What's it say?
1413440	1415520	That page wasn't very interesting.
1415520	1419000	Yeah, before we recorded, it was all pretty boring.
1419000	1420680	We went to a green box.
1420680	1421520	Nice.
1421520	1423320	Bright light and immense noise.
1423320	1427320	The dust begins to crawl, then fly.
1427320	1428920	The cave is full of lice.
1431660	1435160	The cave is full of lice is fucking horrifying sentence.
1435160	1436000	It is.
1436000	1439680	What, have you ever heard of this cow, Peck?
1439680	1441080	Well, I mean, it's, you know,
1441080	1443520	a well-known band of kooks, of course.
1443520	1448020	They investigate Bigfoot and other nonsense.
1448020	1450160	They think the moon landing never happened.
1450160	1453080	I mean, but do we like have proof, you know?
1453080	1454300	Like, did you see it?
1454300	1455140	Yes.
1458320	1461960	A nice moment of levity in a horrifying dark room
1461960	1464560	of terror and smelly nonsense.
1466320	1468480	So like, it's crazy that I'm here
1468480	1469840	to answer all these questions,
1469840	1472440	but the 20s are what we called them
1472440	1477440	because it was roughly, you know how Greg got got?
1477900	1479520	He was Greg and now he's Fox.
1479520	1482160	Right, by the mind control.
1482160	1484280	Yeah, it's kind of like mind control.
1485280	1487880	But basically when he does it,
1489080	1493080	there's probably like a 20% chance that it just,
1493080	1496020	and she points at the walls around you.
1496020	1498100	It just kind of does this to you.
1498100	1500100	It makes you a role-playing podcaster
1500100	1501340	with the mind of a child.
1504940	1507060	Essentially, yeah.
1507060	1509360	Yeah, I mean, you just talk and talk and talk,
1509360	1511800	but nothing of substance ever really comes out,
1511800	1515340	just yammering on and on about some tower,
1515340	1517420	getting God back to heaven.
1517420	1519420	It's just, they just talk and talk.
1519420	1522460	Is there any left?
1522460	1525660	I mean, I thought that we were gonna be surrounded.
1525660	1527940	I was ready for a different kind of fight, honestly,
1528760	1529600	when we got down here.
1529600	1530940	Don't worry, in a very real way, they're still with us.
1530940	1532100	Let's get out of this pit.
1532100	1532940	Yeah.
1532940	1535360	Yeah, my camera's up there, dude.
1535360	1537960	We're the fucking can news crew, guys.
1537960	1539200	Let's go get our camera.
1539200	1543080	Julius puts his back up against the wall near the hole
1543080	1547700	and puts his hands down, ready to lift people up and out.
1547700	1552700	Okay, we're gonna need a strength check on both accounts.
1552700	1557700	Each time, I'm gonna make sure Luke passes his
1558660	1560780	before you have a good shot at yours.
1560780	1562020	Fail on the first one.
1564300	1567060	29 out of 50, pass on the second one.
1569140	1571860	Should he get a plus 20 since he's lifting with his legs?
1571860	1573140	Fail on the third one.
1574340	1575660	And also, great question.
1575660	1576980	Well, what we're gonna do here-
1576980	1580700	Also, both my fails would have still failed with 20 more.
1581540	1583420	I meant plus 30.
1583420	1587860	Yes, both my fails would have still failed with a plus 30.
1587860	1590160	I got 90s and 80s.
1590160	1592860	Because you guys have time, not a ton of time,
1592860	1597420	but you do have time, whoever is last is gonna be the one
1597420	1600020	who might get stuck, and that's gonna be
1600020	1602580	the difficult place to be in.
1602580	1604740	I mean, it would be me, right?
1604740	1607740	If you were the one lifting everyone up out,
1607740	1608860	like helping everyone up out,
1608860	1610300	then you would be the last one
1610300	1612940	that they're gonna try to pull you up.
1612940	1614260	I think that's the plan, though.
1614260	1618420	So, with enough time, only 10 feet up, a wall behind you,
1618420	1623140	you're easily able to get Beck, Cal, and Stevie
1623140	1625420	up out of the it pit.
1625420	1627340	They're all three looking down at you
1627340	1632340	in this vile, disgusting, absolutely wretched,
1632980	1635660	like it's hard not to throw up while you're still down.
1635660	1636860	And we just walk away.
1636860	1638220	You can't get used to it.
1638220	1642860	To get a little higher up, I would like to sit Vernon
1642860	1645260	up against the wall and stand on his shoulders
1645260	1648100	to have a couple more feet closer to the wall.
1648100	1649500	That's fucking role playing.
1649500	1652600	That is Liam Neeson, Ra's al Ghuling,
1652600	1654140	being aware of your surroundings,
1654140	1657180	and that will get you out of here without rolling.
1657180	1658020	Hell yeah.
1658020	1659780	But we probably need to try to roll.
1659780	1661660	Should we roll to retrieve him?
1661660	1665620	That is gonna be a difficult retrieval, I believe.
1665620	1666460	Fucking leave him in there.
1666460	1667500	I think we should leave him.
1667820	1670380	I think this is the best place for him right now.
1670380	1672300	He's far away to where when he screams,
1672300	1673700	nobody might hear him,
1673700	1675180	because we're gonna shut the door behind us, for sure.
1675180	1679540	Well, we are, but also back to the potential plan.
1679540	1682580	Should we run screaming into the town now,
1682580	1684100	saying help, help, help.
1684100	1687780	As opposed to what's sneaking out of here, I guess.
1687780	1689940	Or casually strolling in and saying,
1689940	1693060	we kicked that guy's ass, fuck you.
1693060	1695980	The former does seem like the better,
1695980	1698300	if those are the only two choices.
1698300	1699860	I don't like to fool the public.
1699860	1702700	In fact, it's my stated mission to never do it.
1702700	1704420	But our very lives depend on it,
1704420	1706820	and so does the information we carry in our minds now,
1706820	1708600	and on Beck's precious camera.
1708600	1711220	Oh, as Beck just caresses.
1711220	1713620	Oh yeah, it's out of the bag and back to filming.
1713620	1716580	What if instead of either of those,
1716580	1721480	remember we were invited to a certain someone's GIZ?
1721480	1722580	Greg?
1722580	1725200	Do you think we could just go to Greg's
1725240	1727480	and see if we can't get some help?
1727480	1729960	I mean, he probably wouldn't know
1729960	1731920	what was happening with us.
1731920	1733240	If he's just at his house,
1733240	1734980	he hasn't been paying attention to anything,
1734980	1738440	so he wouldn't even know that we're heading to trial,
1738440	1740960	and she looks at her phone, and she's like,
1740960	1742320	in like half an hour.
1742320	1744280	Did we ever ask if we have cell phone reception?
1744280	1746720	I'm not sure if you did ask, but I do have to pee.
1746720	1749440	What if this whole fucking time
1749440	1751200	we could have just called 911?
1751200	1754560	I feel like we did, but I don't wanna say that we did,
1754560	1756580	in case he thinks maybe we can.
1759000	1761520	We've had fucking five bars this whole time.
1761520	1764600	We're getting texts from like, where are you?
1764600	1766560	I'm using my flashlight,
1766560	1769080	just like not looking at anything else on the screen.
1769080	1771040	Your battery is draining to nothing.
1773040	1776280	I'm gonna go with a solid, there's no way, but.
1776280	1777560	We wouldn't have had a reason to
1777560	1779040	up until we got sentenced to death,
1779040	1781840	so right now exploring that option is probably.
1781840	1784040	The giant statues are just cell towers.
1784040	1785360	That fucking 5G.
1785360	1788500	Turning everybody into freaking werefoxes.
1790560	1792880	Zach, I remember the thing that I thought of
1792880	1794680	that was maybe important, and then I forgot.
1794680	1795920	It was pretty important.
1795920	1797280	I hit a breaking point.
1797280	1799480	Oh, I had a question too for you.
1799480	1802160	Yeah, right when we got down in there, huh?
1802160	1803740	We'll do a breaking point for you now.
1803740	1804660	What was your question?
1804660	1807120	I was looking on my phone to see
1807120	1810280	what I wrote down as my phobia or whatever.
1810280	1811480	This is what I had.
1811480	1815720	I literally, Julia Summers, phobia.
1815720	1818480	Big pits of blood, flesh, and shit.
1818480	1820600	And then I looked to see if I had a different note,
1820600	1825160	and the next one was grip colon in a different note,
1825160	1826840	and I just never wrote it down.
1826840	1829240	With no number, amazing.
1829240	1830880	But I knew it was something to do with that,
1830880	1832180	and that makes sense.
1832180	1833020	Good to go.
1834600	1836280	It's from July 5th.
1836280	1837120	Grip.
1837160	1838000	Oh.
1841280	1842120	Grip.
1842120	1842940	Grip.
1842940	1843780	Okay, cool.
1843780	1845320	Well, let's have Luke and Thomas
1845320	1846780	take off your headphones real quick,
1846780	1848320	and Joe, let's.
1848320	1849440	Forget how we're doing it this season.
1849440	1851760	This season, we're just kinda deciding
1851760	1852680	what it's gonna be.
1852680	1853680	Oh, good, cool.
1853680	1855220	Between the two of us.
1855220	1857880	Well then, I've got a few options.
1857880	1859160	Yeah, hit me with them.
1859160	1862600	Just viscera and gore and gross gore.
1862600	1863440	Gross gore.
1863440	1864640	Like beyond just blood.
1864640	1865560	Yeah.
1865600	1867680	Or crazy designs.
1867680	1869160	I like, I.
1869160	1872360	Joe, the player, loves investigating crazy designs.
1872360	1873200	Yeah.
1873200	1874020	Yeah.
1876600	1877760	Or if you got something else.
1877760	1879240	Yeah, yeah.
1879240	1880440	I think that.
1880440	1883520	It was literally the fight response
1883520	1885640	was what made me, my sanity broke,
1885640	1887320	and I had a fight response,
1887320	1888820	if you want it to be fight related.
1888820	1889660	Okay, yeah, yeah.
1889660	1891140	It was the least likely thing I had put.
1891140	1892240	I rolled a one to get it.
1892240	1893200	Okay, yeah.
1893200	1894040	What about?
1895640	1898320	What about like men wearing suits?
1898320	1899640	Oh, because of the landlord, you mean?
1899640	1900480	Yeah.
1900480	1901300	Oh, yeah.
1901300	1903560	Or like, I guess that's a little strange,
1903560	1904400	maybe, I don't know.
1904400	1906480	Or heights, you could also do heights.
1906480	1907320	Like falling?
1907320	1908140	Yeah.
1908140	1910320	But I like either of the first two
1910320	1912760	that you came up with, so I'll.
1912760	1914360	I like the ones you said, though.
1915320	1916300	I mean.
1916300	1917140	I'll defer to you.
1917140	1920240	I'm between the heights, the suit,
1920240	1922400	and the blood, because I don't.
1922400	1923560	Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree with you.
1923600	1925760	Every time we look at this diagram,
1925760	1926880	if we ever look at it again.
1926880	1928340	We'll all cut out heights.
1928340	1930920	Okay, so suits or viscera?
1930920	1932560	I mean, let's just roll for it,
1932560	1933640	because either one.
1933640	1934480	Yeah.
1934480	1937160	One, two, three is blood.
1937160	1939020	Four, five, six is the other one.
1939900	1940740	It's a four.
1940740	1942160	Okay, so men in suits.
1942160	1943260	Men wearing suits.
1943260	1945020	I mean, that's great.
1945020	1947200	That's good for Beck as a character.
1947200	1952200	I will say, as soon as we have decided that,
1952520	1953760	you're gonna need to.
1953760	1955560	Am I gonna have to fight every person in a suit?
1955560	1959080	Well, you're gonna need to work on maybe Julius and Kal.
1959080	1959920	Oh, fuck.
1962880	1964840	I forgot I was surrounded by men in suits.
1964840	1966480	Yeah, they both wear those,
1966480	1969280	and so does everyone you work with.
1969280	1972920	I was picturing just running into maybe some of the Godels.
1972920	1974320	Nope, it's everybody around me.
1974320	1975160	Ouchie, ouchie.
1979000	1980200	Shit.
1980200	1982440	So, okay, then I need to clarify with you right now,
1982440	1984560	like how extreme is this?
1984560	1985800	Is it a phobia, would you call it?
1985800	1986640	Yeah.
1986640	1987460	I'm scared of the suit.
1987460	1989520	Yeah, scared of the suit, I suppose.
1989520	1990340	Yeah.
1990340	1992320	And then if I have them remove their jackets,
1992320	1993360	would that be enough for me?
1993360	1994520	Yeah, I think so.
1994520	1997600	Yeah, removing of the jacket is gonna be enough.
1997600	1998760	It takes the power away.
2001640	2003560	Okay, but okay, yeah.
2003560	2004460	But okay.
2004460	2006480	I just don't know how, like, when I go.
2006480	2009520	I mean, literally, let's say as soon as you get up out
2009520	2013600	of the pit and you're looking at them for the first time,
2013600	2015600	and they're also covered in this stuff,
2015600	2019180	like he was when you attacked him,
2019180	2021480	you're gonna need them to change
2021480	2023900	how they look pretty quickly, yeah.
2023900	2026040	But it's, yeah, it's just an uncomfortable thing for me.
2026040	2029680	Like, it's not gonna make me lash out at them, per se.
2029680	2030760	No, but I think that you need
2030760	2032800	to be pretty intense about it.
2032800	2033920	Cool, yeah, I get that.
2033920	2036000	I just mean, like, if I run into my,
2036000	2039280	like, if I run into his thief, if I run into Typh,
2039920	2040760	am I gonna be angry with him?
2040760	2042040	I think you're just gonna be weird.
2042040	2042880	Exactly, that's what I mean.
2042880	2046200	Yes, weird, stilted, like, no eye contact,
2046200	2049200	not cool-ass fucking Beck like you used to be.
2049200	2050240	I'm all about it.
2050240	2053080	Women in non-binary, women in non-binary people
2053080	2054600	in suits are fine.
2054600	2055540	I dig it.
2056540	2057480	You should check the recording,
2057480	2059440	make sure we're still recording after the lights blinked.
2059440	2062040	We are still recording after the lights blinked.
2064460	2066120	Luke, you can take your ears out.
2066120	2068600	Ooh, I was making little beats, you know?
2069040	2071540	I was like, damn, I would never listen to this shit.
2074200	2075040	Man, it is.
2075040	2076920	Dude, it is going nutso.
2076920	2078040	Gettin' it out there.
2078040	2080560	You should be quiet and try and get a good take-a-one
2080560	2082120	that you can then loop whenever you need to.
2082120	2082960	Yeah.
2085760	2088820	Wow, that was a good one.
2089960	2091500	Needs to, like, hit our house.
2092760	2094000	Famous last podcast.
2098600	2100940	That was a really good one.
2100940	2102600	That was really good.
2104600	2105920	Good job, Thomas.
2108920	2111400	Thinking about thunder and lightning
2111400	2113080	brought me to thinking about Thor,
2113080	2115080	which brought me to thinking about Norse mythology,
2115080	2116920	which brought me to thinking about Neil Gaiman,
2116920	2118400	which brought me to thinking about Sandman,
2118400	2119240	anybody's favorite?
2119240	2120080	Yeah.
2120080	2120900	Yeah.
2120900	2121740	Yeah.
2121740	2122580	Yeah.
2122580	2123400	Yeah.
2123400	2124240	Yeah.
2124240	2125080	Yeah.
2125080	2125900	Yeah.
2125900	2126740	Yeah.
2126740	2127580	Yeah.
2127580	2128420	Thinking about Sandman,
2128420	2130860	anybody started watching that on Netflix?
2130860	2132540	I have not, but I want to.
2132540	2133380	Is it good?
2133380	2135740	I watched the first episode only, but I loved it.
2135740	2137800	I thought it was a really cool first episode
2137800	2139140	and it makes, I've never read the book,
2139140	2141940	so I'm intrigued as to what is gonna happen.
2141940	2144200	I definitely want to watch it.
2144200	2146060	I just like, when it came out, I was like,
2146060	2149080	I'm not in the mood to watch something like this
2149080	2151220	because I wanted to watch something stupid.
2151220	2152460	I wanna see it too.
2152460	2155140	Yeah, so often I just wanna watch something stupid.
2155140	2158860	Is his name Morpheus or Morby?
2158860	2160740	It's not Morbius.
2160740	2162420	I read the description and it was something like that.
2162420	2163260	Morbius sounds right,
2163260	2165240	cause he is the God of like dreams,
2165240	2168060	which is in real life, who Morbius is.
2168060	2169100	In real life?
2171180	2174580	Did Neil Gaiman quickly write the books
2174580	2176860	based off the Morbintime meme
2176860	2179180	and then they produced a show and released it?
2179180	2180220	You're thinking of The Matrix.
2180220	2181060	Maybe.
2181060	2181880	Oh, well.
2181880	2186880	Oh, Morpheus slow down the river of live streaming.
2189960	2190800	Whoa.
2190800	2192520	Yeah, Joe's eyes just went white
2192520	2194800	and he floated in the air for a second
2194800	2196260	and he said that weird shit.
2198360	2199720	I think it was a prophecy.
2199720	2202600	That's just a little Rocky Horror picture show for you.
2204240	2205080	All right.
2205080	2206720	We're all out of the hole at this point.
2206720	2209560	All four of you are out of the hole,
2209560	2212800	looking down at the slumped body
2212800	2215100	of Vernon Covington, the landlord,
2215100	2220000	which Julius Summers has just used along with your help
2220000	2222180	to get up out of the it pit.
2223920	2224760	Wow.
2229120	2231040	Did you hear that crackle in the headphones?
2231040	2231860	It was good.
2231860	2232700	That was wild.
2232700	2233680	Whoa.
2233680	2235200	Yeah, you're gonna have plenty of options
2235200	2237720	of thunder samplings.
2238720	2242040	And Beck looks up from his camera,
2242040	2245040	looks at Cal and Julius,
2245040	2249460	but with something different in his eyes.
2250780	2255040	Hey, what's up, what's up, what's up fellas?
2255040	2257380	It sure is hot today.
2257380	2260980	Boy, howdy, you guys look like you're real hot.
2262000	2264840	Would you guys want to take off your coats, please?
2265840	2267760	Is it hot in here?
2267760	2269480	Much to you, Beck.
2269480	2270800	Yeah, yeah, thanks Cal.
2270800	2271800	Julius, please.
2271800	2273520	It's covered in shit and blood.
2273520	2275680	I was planning on removing it anyway.
2275680	2276960	Yeah, there you go.
2276960	2277800	They're dirty.
2277800	2279340	That's it.
2279340	2282260	Julius is like, yeah, gross, and takes his off.
2282260	2283100	Yeah.
2284960	2286960	Yeah, cool.
2286960	2288320	Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
2288320	2289160	Yeah.
2289160	2292280	Okay, so we were talking about whether we're going to
2292280	2294680	like come out all.
2295360	2298080	Yeah, whether we're going to go to Greg's GIZ
2298080	2300400	or whether we're going to come out and say like,
2300400	2303720	hey, what's up, we're back.
2303720	2305340	We're ready for our trial now, please.
2305340	2307360	Or we can get the fuck out of here.
2307360	2309480	Stevie, do the people of Grover's Gorge
2309480	2310960	know about the It Pit?
2310960	2314600	Yeah, the people of Grover's Gorge know about the It Pit.
2314600	2315440	All of them?
2315440	2316260	Yeah.
2316260	2317800	Do they know what it's like in there?
2317800	2319920	Yeah, I think they do, Cal.
2319920	2322340	Guys, I think we need to decide
2322340	2325580	what we ultimately want to do
2325580	2328820	before we go down any of these avenues, aren't we?
2328820	2330540	Yes, let's make a five-year plan.
2332720	2334940	Stevie, we were talking like in the hole,
2334940	2337900	like is there a chance that we're looked favorably upon
2337900	2339580	because of this landlord situation?
2339580	2341660	Like maybe he's an asshole and everybody was like,
2341660	2342740	thank God he's gone.
2342740	2345380	Yeah, I mean, Fred definitely won't like it
2345380	2348940	when he gets back, but we should have time hopefully
2348940	2351940	until, I mean, they definitely told him
2351940	2353280	that Sandro died.
2353280	2356220	Like they definitely told him that Sandro died, so.
2356220	2359100	Like, and he would come back for that turtle.
2359100	2364100	Yeah, so he would definitely come back for that turtle, yeah.
2364940	2366940	Was that just a turtle
2366940	2370260	or was that turtle functionally the mayor of this town?
2370260	2372300	Not functionally the mayor of this town,
2372300	2375660	but pretty importantly, the mayor of this town.
2375660	2377420	In like a community pride sense
2377420	2380340	or in some weird dark forces way.
2380340	2382300	Yeah, it's gonna be that second one.
2382300	2385300	I'm gonna sound really out of control here
2385300	2387540	while I'm talking, but just know
2387540	2390420	that this is really out there.
2390420	2395340	I did see a spirit or dark energy come out of the turtle.
2395340	2396300	Quiet, Julius.
2396300	2397860	Stevie was just about to tell us
2397860	2399920	about the spooky shit going on with the turtle.
2399920	2400760	Yeah.
2400760	2401600	Yeah.
2405600	2407060	No, no, that's go on.
2407420	2410340	I didn't, you saw, you saw it?
2410340	2415300	It had a, looked human almost.
2415300	2420300	It was, I mean, it sounded like it was talking too,
2421580	2425840	but not anything, not real words
2425840	2428840	or words that I could understand.
2428840	2433840	And when I saw it, I got this taste in my mouth,
2434320	2437240	just salt, salty, saline.
2437240	2439120	You saw God?
2439120	2442360	Beck's eyes are wide looking at Julius.
2442360	2446160	I, dude, like I saw like something too,
2446160	2448640	but it like wasn't that, dude.
2448640	2449480	I mean, what?
2449480	2451440	But it's God?
2451440	2453760	Yeah, I mean, I didn't.
2454920	2457320	And she kind of looks down at the ground
2457320	2461560	and is like, I kind of always thought that it wasn't real.
2461560	2464200	Like there was some other explanation for all of this,
2464200	2468040	but I'm starting to fucking freak out, man.
2468040	2471600	Stevie, Stevie, Stevie, calm down, calm down, Stevie.
2471600	2473920	Listen to me, look at me, look into my eyes.
2473920	2475400	She looks up at you.
2475400	2477780	That's not God, God is a woman.
2480240	2484240	She only loses two sanities, she's reassured by this.
2486040	2488880	No, right, that's not God, but then what is it?
2488880	2491340	Okay, but it is God because it did all this shit.
2491980	2492820	It did everything.
2492820	2496060	I mean, it's like, it's like gave him all the power.
2496060	2498820	It's like, what did you, you saw it too, Beck?
2498820	2501840	I mean, like I saw something like come out of the turtle
2501840	2504020	and like go into Chuck.
2504020	2505460	Did you see it go into Chuck?
2505460	2507460	To me, I didn't like quite see like,
2507460	2509500	it didn't look human to me exactly.
2509500	2511780	And like, I didn't hear anything
2511780	2513780	unless I didn't ask the right questions.
2515300	2516820	There's no such thing as the right questions.
2516820	2518140	I didn't like hear anything.
2518740	2520940	Dude, like to me, it was just like,
2520940	2522600	somebody like shot a super soaker
2522600	2524000	out of the turtle into Chuck.
2524000	2525060	What did you see, Cal?
2525060	2529140	Hold on, hold on, you're both talking so fast, it's crazy.
2529140	2532400	Now someone, I thought the turtle leaped to its death,
2532400	2534140	but someone shot a super soaker at it?
2534140	2538700	I mean, it looked like maybe that was what I saw.
2538700	2540720	You remember how it like leapt off the edge, right?
2540720	2541560	Yes.
2541560	2543860	So then the super soaker came out up from beneath
2543860	2545860	like where that, like where it would have
2545860	2547960	probably like impacted is what like,
2547960	2550340	I like inferred or whatever.
2550340	2553300	And it like shot up and over and like into Chuck.
2553300	2558000	The humanoid talking, tasting energy went into Chuck
2558000	2560020	and he exploded through the glass.
2560020	2561700	See, I didn't see like a humanoid thing.
2561700	2563780	I just saw like a super soaker blast, dude.
2563780	2566280	Boys, I need you to look at my fingers, please.
2566280	2568300	How many fingers am I holding up?
2568300	2569860	Five.
2569860	2571580	Yeah, I'm counting five, my dude.
2571580	2573400	Okay, I just needed to be sure
2573400	2575500	you could still be trusted with the news.
2576580	2581420	I mean like, yeah, dude, that's my biggest regret
2581420	2583160	is that I didn't film this.
2583160	2584300	I was startled.
2584300	2586340	You didn't get a date.
2586340	2589100	Remind Joe, I think I said that there was something else
2589100	2590260	that startled me at the time, right?
2590260	2594380	Well, you were shooting the deep healing that was happening.
2594380	2597140	I think even Julius grabbed your camera or something.
2597140	2598420	There was some reason that I remember
2598420	2599940	it like jostled down to the ground.
2599940	2601340	It was a failed roll, yeah.
2601340	2602580	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
2602580	2604980	Yeah, like it's not there, dude.
2605020	2606180	It's not in the footage.
2606180	2607640	Fuck.
2607640	2608620	I got the aftermath,
2608620	2610900	because you remember when Chuck went through that window?
2610900	2613740	Like that was why he got pushed through that window.
2613740	2615900	Because of God, who is a turtle?
2615900	2618280	I'm not sure about the God thing.
2618280	2620660	God turtle, Godel, God, is there something in there?
2620660	2621940	God turtle.
2621940	2624420	Cal, you fucking figured it out, my dude.
2624420	2629400	God turtle, Godel, God turtle, God turtle, God turtle.
2629400	2630460	Go back, back, back.
2631460	2632300	But still.
2632820	2636340	We don't want to reveal our position just yet.
2637940	2639500	Stevie.
2639500	2640340	Yeah?
2640340	2642060	Is that why you're named Godel?
2642060	2643380	I don't think so.
2643380	2645220	You're the Godel.
2653580	2655380	I never put that together.
2655380	2657540	God turtle, God turtle, God turtle.
2657540	2661940	Let's mark that hypothesis as a maybe.
2662620	2664300	No potential.
2664300	2665540	I mean, it's probably ancient times
2665540	2667900	they've been worshiping the Godel turtle.
2667900	2671460	Turtle, turtle, God total, God total.
2671460	2672540	It's ancient, man.
2672540	2675220	God damn it, that does follow linguistic principles.
2678500	2679540	It makes sense.
2679540	2681420	Stevie, like maybe you're figuring this out
2681420	2682260	for the first time.
2682260	2684100	Yeah, I think we cracked the code here, dude.
2684100	2686860	I think we did, I think we figured it all out.
2686860	2688040	This is amazing.
2692300	2694700	Either way, we have to get out of here.
2694700	2696740	And here it's Godel's all the way down.
2700740	2702140	Oh my God.
2702140	2703580	Total, total.
2703580	2707380	Do we have enough incriminating footage
2707380	2711620	and usable, good quality television to leave?
2711620	2714380	I mean, I got a bunch of footage of that viscera pit,
2714380	2717900	like that's, nobody's supposed to have like that
2717900	2719420	on their property.
2719420	2720820	If we can even leave,
2720860	2723740	it might be time to start preparing our defense.
2723740	2726380	Stevie, do you think you could get us out of here?
2726380	2729300	If we stay, I can try.
2729300	2732900	And if we leave, I'll try to help.
2732900	2734800	Should we stay or should we go?
2734800	2737980	Now, we have to decide.
2737980	2742980	Personally, my vote is stay and risk our lives
2743420	2745780	for great programming.
2745780	2747340	If we stay, there could be trouble.
2747340	2748180	Yeah.
2748220	2750900	So, do you know what my uncle will say?
2750900	2752100	There could be double, dude.
2752100	2753340	There could be double.
2753340	2754260	Why would your uncle say that?
2754260	2757360	Yeah, why would he get upset because we're alive?
2757360	2759560	The same reason I'm getting upset
2759560	2761820	thinking about leaving this place.
2763980	2766820	Which is what, you're not done getting your fucking story?
2766820	2769060	You're willing to risk all of our lives for it?
2769060	2770000	Precisely.
2770000	2770840	Oh.
2770840	2771680	Oh.
2771680	2773100	Yeah, I mean, I-
2773100	2775260	We have the story, Julius.
2775260	2776580	But I'm sure there's more.
2776580	2777940	There's a real part of Beck
2777940	2780500	that is a little bit Julius in here,
2780500	2784260	that this is footage that nobody's ever seen before.
2784260	2786460	What else could we maybe get?
2786460	2790500	I mean, guys, this is the story of the century.
2790500	2793340	Only if we get it out of here.
2793340	2796820	But the more we get, it could be its own canned show.
2796820	2798220	Screw episodes, dude.
2798220	2800460	We could do a whole documentary special
2800460	2803660	and you'd win the Pulitzer for this, dude.
2803660	2805780	I feel like I've lost some grip here.
2805820	2807420	This is a very bad idea.
2807420	2810300	Beck, you should know, this is a very bad idea.
2810300	2812220	No, yeah, for sure, for sure, for sure.
2812220	2815220	Cal, you know how in your house you've got
2815220	2818760	pictures of you with famous people?
2818760	2821860	You could be one of those people
2821860	2824860	that people have pictures of in their house.
2824860	2827020	I am one of those people, Julius.
2827020	2828620	Do you wanna be one of those people?
2828620	2830340	Because you won't if you die here.
2830340	2832160	And I won't if I leave with all we have.
2832160	2834780	With this amazing footage we already have,
2834780	2837680	we have a treasure and you are getting greedy for more.
2837680	2838520	I am.
2838520	2840660	And I won't follow you to this death.
2840660	2842760	Julius just looks at Beck.
2842760	2845020	Beck does, part of him really still wanna stay in film,
2845020	2848000	but I mean, I guess this place isn't going anywhere.
2848000	2850380	Like, could we come back with maybe like?
2850380	2851660	We can come back with.
2851660	2853220	A bigger crew or whatever?
2853220	2855260	An armed federal escort.
2855260	2859180	We will report on this place when it is raided
2859180	2860620	by the federal government.
2860620	2862780	What we have now is enough to make that happen.
2862780	2864620	Julius just kind of nods his head.
2865500	2867660	He absolutely still would like to stay and shoot more,
2867660	2870100	but he knows that this is a team
2870100	2872500	and that he has basically been outvoted
2872500	2874080	and so he's not gonna argue anymore.
2874080	2875740	Okay, the best way getting out of here
2875740	2878420	is gonna be around the back of this factory
2878420	2880020	and then we're gonna get into the trees.
2880020	2881240	We're gonna take the tree line
2881240	2883460	all the way to the big plant wall.
2883460	2886700	We're gonna have our fucking teeth in that wall
2886700	2889980	as we just crouch and kind of shuffle our way
2889980	2892740	as quietly and as smoothly as possible.
2893260	2895500	Across this plant wall all the way to the door.
2895500	2897900	Possibly like walking, like you're sitting.
2897900	2900340	I think that that would probably keep us
2900340	2902480	out of the view of the most people.
2904540	2907900	Kal is like silently composing a personnel complaint.
2909800	2913300	Julius is a little bit happier knowing that he can leave
2913300	2915540	with at least a cool escape TikTok.
2917820	2919820	Is she suggesting further east?
2919820	2921140	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2921180	2924140	So just further east, just straight into the forest
2924140	2926820	is where she pointed, like straight into this tree line,
2926820	2928820	this thick tree line that's on the far east side
2928820	2931640	and then going as far south as possible,
2931640	2933300	like staying in the trees the entire way
2933300	2936860	down to the plant wall and then walking across the plant wall
2936860	2938900	over on the south side that you came in
2938900	2940900	and finding that door and then getting out.
2940900	2941740	The door that we came in.
2941740	2942940	The door that you came in.
2942940	2944220	So we're going east into the woods
2944220	2946340	and then south using the woods as cover.
2946340	2947280	Got it, got it.
2947280	2950400	Is there anywhere we could raid a supply closet
2950400	2953400	or something for extra onesies?
2953400	2954800	I like the green ones myself.
2954800	2957080	The green ones would be in the lab
2957080	2959360	or in the super nice GIZs.
2959360	2961840	It is not important, just the nearest ones.
2961840	2964720	Yeah, I mean those would be here in the factory
2964720	2968720	but I think we're risking a lot by trying to go in there.
2968720	2971100	That'd be like a whole other episode probably.
2971100	2973200	Where are the GIZs to here?
2973200	2975400	All the way across, like on the far other side,
2975400	2979080	like the full west side or like the green,
2979080	2983120	like all the EEs live on the super far west side.
2983120	2986160	Did they leave some of their EE cummings in that pit?
2986160	2987400	Oh, thank God.
2989040	2991440	Yeah, there was punctuation fucking everywhere.
2993840	2997160	Oh, it fucking influenced so many terrible Instagram poets.
2999280	3001280	I like the ones where they grab that newspaper
3001280	3002640	and black out a bunch of words
3002640	3005280	and just leave some of them that make a poem.
3005280	3006120	I haven't seen that.
3006120	3006940	That's kind of nice.
3006940	3007780	That's fun.
3007820	3011040	I like the one where this guy takes a piece of bologna
3011040	3012540	and pokes a bunch of holes in it
3012540	3016620	and then slaps it on a page and then that's the poem.
3016620	3019820	Do you think he'd poke the holes first or afterward?
3019820	3021860	Well, some of them don't work.
3021860	3023180	So I think he just does it.
3025180	3026020	That's how you know.
3026020	3028540	I definitely thought you were just riffing that.
3028540	3030700	No, it's a thing I've seen.
3030700	3035220	Well, I've seen a guy take bologna and poke holes in it.
3035220	3036460	I was like, oh, that's good.
3036460	3037460	What's mine gonna be?
3037780	3038620	Yeah.
3041020	3043020	This footage now from Beck's camera
3043020	3044900	is like when you're watching a documentary
3044900	3047020	and shit hits the fan and it pans around
3047020	3050380	and you see the boom operator is rolling out.
3050380	3052900	You guys are in front of me and it's hazard.
3052900	3054020	It's shaky cam.
3054020	3054860	It's shaky cam.
3054860	3056420	It's some Blair Witch Cloverfield.
3056420	3057260	Going through the woods.
3057260	3059180	Oh, and these woods are pretty intense.
3059180	3060380	We all look a little panicked.
3060380	3062740	People do not traipse through these woods.
3062740	3065000	So it is thick brush.
3065000	3066500	Is Julia still almost dead?
3066540	3067380	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3067380	3068220	He's at two hit points.
3068220	3071180	So literally he's barely breathing.
3071180	3074020	He's able to make all these points and stuff,
3074020	3075900	but he mostly got hit in the face.
3075900	3079220	My head, I am bruised eyeballs.
3079220	3083780	Internal brain hemorrhaging probably.
3083780	3084620	Oh, that explains it.
3084620	3085460	Yeah, it's not.
3085460	3086740	I'm gonna die of a blood clot
3086740	3089140	and we don't get any help soon.
3089140	3092120	You look over at Julius and one of his eyes
3092120	3093940	is completely filled with blood
3093940	3096720	and it's starting to drip from the wrong corner,
3096720	3098180	like not from his tear duct.
3098180	3101440	This crazed half dead man who can barely walk
3101440	3102980	is like, we gotta stay here.
3102980	3103820	Yeah.
3103820	3104660	Yeah.
3104660	3105980	Exactly.
3105980	3108060	And Cal, for some reason,
3108060	3109780	like argued it in a good face
3109780	3112340	instead of just being like, no, you idiot.
3112340	3113180	Like, do you?
3113180	3114000	We need to kill you.
3114000	3114840	What?
3114840	3116540	You could like push him over and kill him.
3116540	3117580	Yeah, like.
3117580	3121140	There's a 50-50 chance that a punch would kill him.
3122140	3123700	Or, you know.
3123700	3124540	I can't punch him.
3128420	3131060	It's actually a 66% chance now that I think about it
3131060	3132860	because it's D4 minus one.
3132860	3134580	Wait, so nope, that's, fuck.
3134580	3135860	That'd be 33% chance.
3135860	3138340	That's 50-50 if it's a D4 minus one.
3138340	3139260	But I have two.
3139260	3140100	Yeah.
3140100	3141760	Oh, so one, yeah, you're right.
3141760	3142600	Fuck.
3142600	3143780	Anyway, don't punch me.
3144940	3149140	Julius with his brain not working as well right now.
3149140	3150180	I'll take a minute.
3150180	3151020	It's a weird one.
3151860	3154580	This would be a really bad place to drive a four-wheeler.
3154580	3156400	I don't understand the reference.
3156400	3157460	Julius doesn't either.
3157460	3161060	He's, his brain's just starting to shut off.
3161060	3162340	Stevie pats you on the back.
3162340	3165260	She's like, it's okay, grandpa, we're almost out.
3165260	3167220	What else do we see?
3167220	3169700	Oh, shit, I mean, oh no.
3169700	3170540	He's Frank Gotthold.
3170540	3172100	Ah, fuck, Julius Gotthold.
3172100	3173340	I mean, Caesar, I mean.
3173340	3174660	I mean, fuck.
3176200	3177060	Oh yeah, we're walking.
3177060	3179740	We finally get to the big plant wall.
3179740	3182180	And okay, guys, it's shimmying time.
3182180	3183940	This is when Julius pulled his phone out to.
3183940	3186020	Shimmy, shimmy, y'all, shimmy, y'all, shimmy.
3186020	3189320	I'm gonna get in behind and TikTok them walking
3189320	3190860	however they're gonna be walking.
3190860	3192420	Yep, not being weird about it.
3193460	3196640	This is the point where we need to be really sneaky.
3196640	3199700	So I need everyone to roll stealth.
3202340	3203380	40 on a 40.
3203380	3204880	Wow.
3204880	3207180	You got a 65 on a 40.
3207180	3208500	I'm sorry, a 30.
3210060	3211020	Fail.
3211020	3212740	I only have 10% in stealth.
3213660	3214500	And I got a three.
3214500	3215860	Oh yeah.
3215860	3217580	Wow.
3217580	3220900	I thought that I would just kind of give an alertness check
3220900	3223500	for just like all of Grover's gorge.
3224700	3227780	And Luke, will you check out what I rolled there?
3231100	3232560	He rolled a 100.
3232560	3234060	Oh, fuck yeah.
3234060	3238180	So they are all taking a big long blink.
3238180	3240520	Literally in my head, I was like, what do I give them?
3240520	3243620	Like 80% as an entire city?
3243620	3245820	Like for someone to see.
3245820	3248740	We're only in part of the city and the part
3248740	3249660	that's best to hide in.
3249660	3251980	Well, then it's a great thing for everyone
3251980	3254260	that I rolled a 100 just now.
3254260	3255100	Holy shit.
3255100	3257060	As you guys hit the door,
3257060	3262060	creak it open and take one last look out at Grover's gorge.
3262220	3266300	You all actually notice why all the residents
3266300	3268540	are not paying you any mind.
3268540	3271980	You see Chuck Bidwell, bright blue eyes,
3271980	3274060	face lined by the sun,
3274060	3279060	topped by a tight flat top of salt and pepper hair stocky,
3279820	3283500	the muscle of his youth turned fat.
3283500	3288500	And Chuck Bidwell wearing his green polo
3289220	3294220	is absolutely drenched, wet, soaking
3294660	3297940	as he walks through Grover's gorge.
3297940	3300620	You grab the door, close it shut.
3303260	3305540	Click on the other side.
3305540	3307380	And you guys are standing,
3307380	3310340	looking out at the massive gorge
3310340	3313020	that you saw when you arrived.
3313020	3316620	Fog is filling up this enormous gorge.
3316620	3318460	And you see that the train,
3318460	3322660	the single steel train car is sitting
3322660	3324740	on your side of the gorge.
3324740	3326860	Just how it was the last time you were here.
3326860	3330620	Cal sees Julius tick-tocking all of this.
3330620	3333700	And he says, Julius, put that fucking phone away
3333700	3334780	and get on the train.
3338940	3341700	Julius gets up flush with the train
3341700	3345620	and is gonna tick-tock you guys walking into the train
3345620	3347260	and then get in the train.
3347260	3349060	And he saves it in drafts
3349060	3352080	with his six other tick-tocks he's taken
3352360	3353320	since he's been here.
3355800	3358640	Cal takes a big like stress bite out of his lasagna.
3366720	3367840	What's up everybody?
3367840	3368800	I'm Zach.
3368800	3370400	And I hope you're enjoying season two
3370400	3372400	of Pretending to Be People so far.
3372400	3374000	We're having a ton of fun.
3374000	3376120	And that fun isn't going to stop,
3376120	3378640	but it is gonna slow down a bit.
3378640	3380600	Putting the show out mostly weekly
3380640	3384000	for almost three years now has been my pleasure.
3384000	3385520	And I'm tired.
3385520	3389840	It's been affecting my mood for the past month or six,
3389840	3391040	which sucks.
3391040	3395600	And I want this show to continue to be a pleasure to create.
3395600	3398040	And I don't want the quality of the show to suffer.
3398040	3399440	So in order for that to happen,
3399440	3400640	we're going to move
3400640	3403240	to an every other Friday release schedule.
3403240	3406320	Now the goal is to get back to weekly episodes.
3406320	3409520	So I've reached out to someone who can help lighten my load
3409560	3410800	on the editing side of things
3410800	3412760	by cleaning up the tracks of debris
3412760	3414400	before I finish them off.
3414400	3417120	But that process will take time to smooth out
3417120	3418960	and it will expedite the process,
3418960	3420400	but it'll still take time and money.
3420400	3424200	So with our eyes set on getting back to weekly,
3424200	3427600	we've got two new Patreon goals.
3427600	3430920	The first is at $5,785,
3430920	3435720	which is of course $69,420 over the year.
3435720	3436760	At this first goal,
3436800	3438520	pretending to be people will move
3438520	3440440	from every other Friday releases
3440440	3442440	to three episodes per month,
3442440	3446720	dropped on the first, 11th, and 21st.
3446720	3450200	The Patreon goal to go back to weekly releases
3450200	3455200	is set at, you guessed it, $6,942 per month.
3455280	3458640	And when we hit the PTBP radio frequency,
3458640	3460240	we'll be once again swaddled
3460240	3463960	in Wolf's warm and weekly embrace.
3463960	3465160	But with the sad news,
3465160	3468600	I also bring three fun announcements.
3468600	3471640	First, we recently recorded another side story
3471640	3472560	for season two,
3472560	3477320	and we had another mind-blowingly talented guest.
3477320	3481320	Becca Scott joined us for a four episode
3481320	3484000	modern Delta Green operation set in the city.
3484000	3486160	She was fantastic.
3486160	3488040	We were fantastic.
3488040	3490600	I'm seriously, I'm so excited for y'all to hear it.
3490600	3492200	It's nasty.
3492200	3496480	Second, the Den of Sin will be live on Tuesday, October 25th
3496480	3499760	for a very special Halloween episode.
3499760	3502880	We'll be following Clark Bishop, John Lee Pettymore III,
3502880	3507520	and Keith Vigna as kids at Clinkers Daycare
3507520	3509760	as they go trick or treating in contention
3509760	3512040	on what could not so canonically
3512040	3514640	be their last Halloween ever.
3515600	3517680	And the edited podcast episode of that game
3517680	3521160	will be out before the November Den of Sin,
3521200	3524080	which is the third and final cool thing.
3524080	3526520	And November Thomas is going to kick off
3526520	3531520	his Oops All Pettymore's Patreon campaign
3531680	3534440	with a Pettymore family Thanksgiving.
3534440	3538040	Joe, Luke, and I will all be playing members of the fam
3538040	3542760	for the run, and we are really fucking excited about it.
3544800	3548800	Okay, seriously, thank you so much for listening.
3548800	3551880	This is a wildly cool thing to be a part of,
3551880	3554080	and I really hope it continues to be fun,
3554080	3556920	and rad, and sick, and twisted, because I like it.
3556920	3559920	["My Life Is Great"]
3559920	3562920	["My Life Is Great"]
3579680	3581480	But it is a little gummy, you know?
3581480	3582960	If you wadded it up, it'd be...
3582960	3584960	No, it's a very long gummy.
3584960	3585800	But it's thin.
3585800	3587880	You can only fold a fruit by the foot
3587920	3589840	on itself eight times before.
3589840	3591480	Oh my God, is that true?
3591480	3592320	Yeah.
3592320	3593160	I think it needs a square, right?
3593160	3594000	Yeah, any loser.
3595280	3596880	Make them fold eight times.
3599880	3601840	If you fold a fucking nerd.
3601840	3605480	And I say, hey, do you want to see how much I can bend you?
3605480	3607320	Did it just lightning?
3607320	3608240	Shut up, nerd.
