0	2560	What's good, my nasty children?
2560	7000	It's your busted ass ass bustin' Buster Wolf the dog.
7000	9520	And I'm here to bust up them eardrums
9520	11880	with my drumstick tongue.
11880	16040	Am I Russian or am I dragon?
16040	17320	Who can say?
17320	20420	Prepare to get whiplashed like JK Simmons
20420	22840	because we got a new Howlin' with Wolf.
22840	27300	Today's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Maury from Seattle
27300	28640	who tweeted about the show
28680	30960	and tagged that pretendin' pod.
30960	32200	They right.
32200	36420	First things first, Wolf, your dulcet tones haunt my dreams
36420	39680	and your musical taste is always on point.
39680	41080	Much respect.
41080	43800	Mad thanks to the PTBP crew.
43800	47120	Y'all introduce this lifetime D&D player
47120	50200	to the fun Delta Green has to offer.
50200	54000	And last things last, shout out to my friends Darian,
54000	56880	Ryan, Robbie, and Mike.
56880	60760	You volunteered so I could learn how to be a good handler
60760	65760	and I promise to murder you all in fun and interesting ways.
66760	69260	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
69260	71360	Thank you, Maury from Seattle.
71360	75040	I once went to Seattle and I saw a whole bunch of crabs
75040	77940	feasting on a mound of rotten hot dogs.
77940	81740	Now that is a city Wolf can get inside of.
81740	85920	If you wanna howl at your Wolf, tag us on the internet.
85960	88080	Or write a five star review
88080	90400	and shoot us an email or somethin'.
90400	92360	We love hearin' from y'all.
92360	96760	All the links are in the show notes.
96760	99480	And while you're perusin' that vast and mysterious
99480	104480	worldwide spider butt stuff, go ahead and do Wolf a favor.
104520	107800	Follow at Scott Dorward on Twitter
107800	110120	and check out his various projects,
110120	113880	be they podcast or publication based.
113920	117360	And maybe fill up on hugs when you feel strife.
117360	121240	It's Grady Philip Drug with Real Life.
121240	126240	Life, surreal, in retrospect a dream.
127880	132880	Easy times, feel less than serene.
133880	138880	In the moment it's hard to count your blessings
138880	143880	so we long for days gone past us.
144880	149880	Grief and strife, bloody, that's Real Life.
158360	160440	All right, let's get gory and vory, baby.
160440	163080	So the rest of you upstairs,
163080	166840	having heard the orifice of the Earth,
166840	170480	having heard the orifice demanding Rothstein
170480	174160	and having lost Rothstein and his panic through the house,
174160	175640	what are you actually doing?
175640	176920	We gotta go.
176920	179720	And Frederick Mellon runs downstairs, takes off running.
179720	182360	This is the only room that we saw from the outside
182360	184120	with a light on in it.
184120	188000	There were other lights dotted throughout the house, yeah.
188000	190100	I guess I mean upstairs.
190100	192280	No, this was the only one upstairs.
192280	195440	Freddie, wait, what if the brain's in here too?
195440	198960	Do we wanna kill it before we get like the kids?
198960	200520	I don't, I really don't know.
200520	202560	It just might be good information to have
202560	204960	where this thing's like neurological center is.
204960	208040	Yeah, I mean it can hear us clearly talking about it.
208040	209920	Oh yeah, I mean.
209920	211180	Oh yeah, sure.
211180	212700	Well, it seems to be in a lot of pain.
212700	214280	All it wants is Rothstein right now.
214280	216400	It's probably not gonna answer our questions.
216400	219040	I wanna look around and see if I can spot anything hidden
219040	221420	that looks like some ganglia or neurons
221420	223960	or you know, gray matter up on the ceilings.
223960	227160	Oh, maybe that's why this room looks different color-wise.
227160	228980	Hmm, this is the kind of thing
228980	231700	where you should probably consult a medical doctor.
233400	236120	Thomas Dolan, what do you know about this?
236120	238120	I was really, I keep forgetting
238120	239720	that they're not the same kind of doctor
239720	240760	and I was really freaked out
240760	243640	that our medical doctor had just run off, but.
243640	246920	No, he's just a, you know, he's just a psychic.
246920	249160	Doctor, Dr. Coombs, what do you think?
249160	252680	Yeah, it's obviously,
252680	254880	is this a first aid roll or a medicine roll?
254880	257200	Let's say either medicine or biology.
258200	259040	Medicine.
260280	263360	That's a pass, a 58 on a 70.
263360	266120	Okay, you don't see anything in the room here
266120	268400	that looks like gray matter,
268400	271960	but yeah, you're fairly certain that
273080	278000	what's inside this room is maybe,
278000	283000	well, maybe working as lungs or something like lungs.
283720	285740	We seem to be in the respiratory system here.
285740	290360	This is all for the breathing of the apparatus here.
290360	291680	The lung and tongue room.
291680	293440	Lung and tongue, yeah.
293440	295800	Maybe the brains are in the attic.
298680	299520	Who said that?
302060	303240	But that is a good point.
303240	305880	Let's have listen rolls off the three of you
305880	307180	who are upstairs.
308160	311720	Just on the off chance you hear something useful.
311720	313000	43 on a 50.
314160	316680	I rolled the worst of the worst, a hundred.
316680	317520	Oh.
317520	318360	I also failed.
318360	322280	Okay, Dr. Coombs is fairly certain
322280	326400	that he has heard from deeper within the house
326400	330820	the sound of a slow, steady heartbeat.
330820	333920	And you may be able to identify what that is.
333920	337100	What Freddy has heard, however,
337100	342100	is the fairly distinctive crunch or cracking sound,
343660	346620	despairing scream and loud splash
346620	349660	of someone falling through the floor in the kitchen.
349660	352660	Heh heh heh heh heh heh.
352660	354980	I'm no medical doctor,
354980	359060	but I think I just heard someone fall through
359060	361140	that same hole that I fell through earlier.
361140	363500	Carl must have forgotten about the lull.
363500	365580	We should go down there.
365580	366420	There were stairs.
366580	367420	There were stairs down there.
367420	369060	Maybe they lead to wherever that hole leads.
369060	371300	You're right, we should go down the stairs.
371300	374740	Do we wanna be in the digestive area of the home?
374740	375860	What if, wait, real quick,
375860	377620	while we're in this room with the mouth,
377620	380260	what if we, I just wanna loudly say,
380260	384380	a monster house, we don't have Rothstein.
384380	386660	He just fell into your belly.
386660	389620	Do not digest him, please.
389620	391580	Or we can't give you what you want.
391580	396380	As you say that, it takes another deep breath in.
396380	398500	And it says something else.
399500	404500	So hungry.
404740	408300	And as it says that, its tongue starts coming
408300	410300	out of its mouth and moving towards you
410300	412300	like a huge fat worm.
412300	413900	Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
413900	416540	Out the door, out the door, out the door.
416540	418940	So you are turning and running.
418940	419780	Yes.
419780	421060	Yeah. Yep, yep.
421060	421900	Yep.
421900	426900	Ooh, what's this?
428620	430620	The tongue is the part you talk with,
430620	432860	so let's stay around and try to talk with it.
435660	438020	Yeah, I'm hauling ass for sure.
438020	441340	Okay, and where are you hauling your ass to?
441340	443380	Ah, it's fucking safe call.
443380	445460	I guess we got a fucking safe call, yeah.
446900	448940	Okay, so speaking of cowl,
448940	453940	so you have tumbled down into the darkness below.
454420	457340	There is pretty much no light down here.
457340	460020	There is a faint, just a faint bit of light
460020	463140	coming up through the hole in the ceiling above you.
463140	467140	The good news is the landing didn't hurt.
467140	469340	The bad news is that's because you have fallen
469340	473180	into what feels like several feet of liquid.
473180	476060	I mean, you've fallen below the surface
476100	479620	and you're going to have to come back up before,
479620	481860	obviously before you can breathe.
481860	486100	What I guess I would like is a constitution roll
486100	489140	just to see whether you can avoid gasping
489140	491780	or doing anything unfortunate under the water.
491780	492620	Oh.
495060	497060	Sorry, I said water, it's really not water.
497060	498380	Yeah, it's not water.
502180	504020	I got a 60 on a 40.
504540	506020	Oh.
506020	510540	Okay, yeah, I mean, obviously this is a huge shock.
510540	514780	I mean, you've not managed to get your way up
514780	515620	to the surface.
515620	518740	There's something bumping around overhead.
518740	522580	You're desperately trying not to take a mouthful
522580	523980	of whatever this is.
523980	527180	You can try to push the roll if you want,
527180	530900	just, yeah, but if you fail,
530900	534380	you are absolutely taking a lung full of this.
535220	537180	It's a 40 on a 40.
537180	538020	Hell yeah.
538020	538860	Fantastic.
538860	539700	Oh, that rolls.
539700	543180	Okay, so you managed to push your way up to the surface
543180	547660	and you take a deep gasping breath of this foul air.
549380	553820	But yeah, you didn't inhale any of this,
553820	558820	which you realize is probably a really, really good thing
558980	560780	now that you're above the surface.
561620	562780	Because now that you're getting your bearings,
562780	566860	you can pick up a few things, even though in the darkness.
566860	569860	One, and possibly the most important,
569860	573860	this liquid that you're in is caustic.
573860	576180	It is burning your skin.
576180	577620	It hurts.
577620	578940	It really hurts.
578940	580420	It's stinging your eyes.
580420	581380	You can barely see.
581380	583500	Your eyes are filled with tears
583500	587340	and yeah, you can feel your skin burning.
587340	590380	You also notice that there are other things
590380	591220	in the liquid.
591220	593340	The thing that was stopping you getting up
593340	597060	was maybe an old packing crate that was floating along.
597060	601260	There's masses of organic matter of some kind
601260	603300	that's just floating there.
603300	606620	Some of these solid lumps of something.
606620	611460	And there are also other more solid things
611460	615900	that every now and then you feel wriggling under the surface.
616820	618660	Let's have a sanity roll.
618660	619500	Yeah.
621380	622540	I fail.
622540	624780	Okay, let's have another d6 sand loss.
626500	627540	Three.
627540	630180	Okay, how much sand have you lost in total?
630180	632140	Prior to this, I've lost eight.
632140	634660	Okay, so you've lost 11 total
634660	637340	and how much sand do you start with?
637340	638900	40, so 29.
638900	643100	Okay, so you are now indefinitely insane as well.
644140	649140	So yeah, your grip on what is real and what isn't
649820	654820	down there in the darkness is just falling apart fast.
656100	659180	I mean, you can hear the sound of this girl sobbing,
659180	661380	but you're not quite sure where it's coming from
661380	663900	and every now and then you're certain
663900	667340	you can hear other voices crying out down there.
667340	670860	These things that are wriggling around under the surface,
670860	673940	some of them, yeah, after your experiences
673940	677020	with these things that can phase through matter,
677060	678500	yeah, you're certain some of them
678500	680860	are just wriggling inside you.
684100	688300	Yeah, and some of the things down there,
688300	691420	they feel almost like hands grasping at you,
691420	694140	trying to hold you down, pull you under the surface.
696220	697060	Jesus Christ.
700660	705020	Okay, so Carl's not doing very good.
705980	710020	If I can try to think about grabbing onto that
710020	713980	floating thing and trying to hoist myself up onto it.
713980	715820	Sure, then give me a dexterity roll
715820	718420	to see whether you can pull yourself on top.
718420	721500	44 on a 50, so that's a pass.
721500	722900	Okay, that's good.
722900	725620	Then yeah, you've managed to pull yourself on top.
725620	727460	I mean, the top of it is slippery
727460	730900	and the weight inside is unbalanced.
730900	733140	You're pretty much almost pushing it
733140	734540	completely under the surface now
734540	736660	with your body weight displacing it,
736660	741660	but yeah, you are largely out of the caustic liquid.
741700	743860	You can take two hit points of damage though,
743860	746540	just for the burns you've taken so far.
746540	747380	Okay.
747380	751420	And the rest of you, as you race down to the kitchen now,
751420	753900	yeah, you can see that hole in the kitchen floor
753900	757100	is now larger and there is definitely the sound
757100	760580	of something large splashing around
760580	762700	down in the liquid below.
763140	768140	Can I try to paddle my boat over to a wall of this area?
769740	773260	Yeah, well, let's see whether you end up,
773260	776700	because you're operating on completely faulty
776700	779220	sensory data at the moment, you're completely lost.
779220	780620	Let's just have a luck roll to see
780620	782380	whether you end up anywhere useful.
783860	785660	No, absolutely not.
787100	791700	Okay, so yeah, you're definitely moving.
793180	794620	Okay.
794620	798380	And I'm just gonna try to like use my foot as a paddle
798380	801060	so I don't get more on my hands.
801060	803700	So I'm just spinning around in a circle.
805980	808700	With the skin on your ankle just getting eaten away.
812980	815060	You can't look up and see any light.
816340	818180	Yeah, is there any light coming in
818180	820460	from the hole I fell into?
820460	821660	The hole isn't above me?
821660	822860	Yeah, not anymore.
823460	824300	It was when you fell in,
824300	827180	but obviously you've moved around a bit since then.
827180	830140	Okay, so it's big enough to like have lost
830140	831540	the whole, this room is?
831540	833060	Yeah, you sort of become aware
833060	836020	that it's not just like one big room,
836020	840540	that it's sort of like a network of smaller rooms.
841860	843820	All right, let's save the doctor, yes.
845740	847780	He's right here, what are you talking about?
847780	848820	He's fine, look at him.
848820	849740	The other doctor.
850740	852260	Oh, that's right.
852260	853820	Doctor number two.
853820	854900	I'm about to be.
857820	858660	Alley-oop.
865140	867500	All right, so that room's still real slick,
867500	870140	so should we like crawl along the floor
870140	871940	to look through the hole to see?
871940	873820	We don't wanna trust the ground there though, right?
873820	876500	Like, I mean, it just gave way under your weight, right?
876500	879020	That's a good point, maybe we just go down the stairs.
879060	880780	I think we should try the thing
880780	882700	that's made to be walked down first, yeah.
882700	885420	We've also still got the part of the hose that didn't tear.
885420	886380	Carl.
886380	891300	So yeah, from somewhere that you can't quite make out,
891300	894460	just echoing through these walls all around you,
894460	898580	you can hear the sound of your voice being called
898580	899740	from up above.
899740	901100	Help!
901100	905300	I just do it once and then I listen.
905300	909780	Almost in answer to that, you can hear another voice,
909780	913180	the voice of a little girl from somewhere down there
913180	916500	as well going, help, help, help.
917580	919540	There's a little girl down here.
919540	921740	That's not my voice, but help me.
924460	925740	Try it in your voice.
927060	928300	I need your help.
931500	932340	Because?
932340	933180	Keep going.
933180	934500	This is a little girl.
938900	940140	All right, we're coming.
941740	942580	Thank you.
943940	945140	That could be Esther, right?
945140	947300	That could be one of the kids we're looking for.
947300	948140	Delphinally.
948140	949500	It'd be weird if it wasn't.
951180	952740	So yeah, let's make our way down those stairs
952740	954900	and see just what we see.
954900	956620	Real quick, I don't know if it would be weird
956620	958980	that the people who are kidnapping kids
958980	962660	to put bugs in them, alien bugs, to steal their potential.
962980	963820	I don't know if it would be weird
963820	966220	if they had other kids that we don't know about.
968700	971100	You're like, it would be weird if it wasn't Esther,
971100	973260	but I think it would actually really follow.
975380	976700	Anyway.
976700	977540	I agree.
979300	983220	But yeah, the stairs down to the cellar,
983220	985660	you can see are covered in the same kind
985660	988660	of slick intestinal teeth.
988660	992140	Good thing we put these nails in our shoes, right, guys?
992540	994780	Yeah, that was smart, but if we found a sled.
995900	998580	Then how would that help us getting back up the stairs?
998580	1000660	Tie the hose to the sled.
1001540	1002500	The hose broke.
1004100	1005740	The bad hose.
1005740	1008780	Let's go down these stairs with full confidence
1008780	1010260	that we can get back up them.
1011260	1013500	By the time you go down just a few of them,
1013500	1015980	you're cut off enough from the light in the kitchen
1015980	1018700	that you're in almost pitch darkness.
1018740	1023540	There is that incredible smell again
1023540	1028540	of just excrement and acid and just foulness.
1030860	1033340	Your eyes are watering from it.
1033340	1036740	And by the time you've made it down
1036740	1038940	even about a half dozen stairs,
1038940	1042340	you can feel that you are now stepping in liquid
1042340	1043660	and it's getting deeper.
1044060	1049060	I had a friend about 20 years ago, her name was Rose.
1049900	1053460	She survived the Titanic by floating on a door.
1055180	1056620	She told me all about it.
1056620	1057580	What if we did this?
1057580	1059140	What if we did the same thing?
1059140	1060980	Did it fit more than one person?
1062540	1064820	No, but there's a lot of doors in this house.
1066540	1069140	That was actually a really sad part of a story.
1069140	1071820	I don't want to make you guys cry right now.
1074500	1075580	But God damn.
1076580	1080340	I'm already crying because the air is so accurate.
1080340	1082340	Well, imagine if you had the greatest love story
1082340	1085180	of all time on top of that and it ended in tragedy.
1085180	1086740	That's what happened on a whole door.
1086740	1088340	So let's get three doors.
1092540	1096540	I was talking about sleds earlier, we got some doors now.
1096540	1098620	You're talking about sleds to get down these stairs.
1098620	1103460	I wasn't saying that it was my idea to float on doors.
1104100	1106020	I was just saying that we could potentially
1106020	1107220	sled down the stairs.
1107220	1109740	And then have sled door boats.
1110660	1111980	Sled your boats.
1113380	1116180	I love the idea that you're having this conversation
1116180	1119660	on the stairs while Rothstein floating around in the muck,
1119660	1123140	lost in a blind panic, is just overhearing little shreds
1123140	1125060	of you talking about doors.
1127540	1128380	And love stories.
1128380	1129420	And Titanic, yeah.
1129420	1133380	You brought that screwdriver.
1133380	1136060	We can bust off a hinge or two real quick, right?
1136060	1137580	Real quick, squeezy.
1137580	1139900	Well, I think because time is a little bit
1139900	1142700	of the essence here because Rothstein is slowly
1142700	1144740	getting eaten away by this acid.
1144740	1147340	I think with all the kicking around that you've been doing
1147340	1149180	in it, trying to steer yourself, I mean,
1149180	1151260	Rothstein's got to take another hit point of damage
1151260	1153180	just from acid burns to his legs.
1153180	1154540	Hey, I'm down to four.
1154540	1155500	Four hit points?
1155540	1156380	Yes.
1157740	1159500	Well comment, don't worry.
1161220	1163100	Maybe we should just do a one door boat
1163100	1165020	and we'll try and navigate that one person
1165020	1166020	through real quick.
1166020	1167540	Not it.
1167540	1170220	I think if you're trying to get a door off in a big hurry,
1170220	1172660	I do want a mechanical repair role for this
1172660	1175060	just simply because time is a factor.
1175060	1176660	I believe I have that.
1177900	1179780	Okay, I've got a 40 in mechanical repair.
1179780	1181300	We'll see what happens.
1181300	1182660	Nice.
1182660	1183580	85.
1183580	1186340	Yeah, the first door you go up to,
1186340	1189260	the problem is that this fleshy material
1189260	1191540	is covered off the hinges and you can't quite see
1191540	1195220	where the screws are and yeah,
1195220	1199460	this isn't really going to be a quick job.
1199460	1203340	You could try potentially going for another door
1203340	1206380	and pushing the roll like that, but if you fail,
1206380	1209660	it's going to take way longer than you planned.
1209660	1210780	Dolan, you're a strong guy.
1210780	1213100	Maybe you could just like jump into the door
1213540	1214380	and bust it down.
1214380	1216260	I try that.
1216260	1217300	Okay.
1217300	1218660	Do I use size?
1218660	1220580	Yeah, I'll take other sizes of strength,
1220580	1222340	whichever you prefer.
1222340	1225620	I'm gonna go size with a 29 on an 80.
1225620	1229900	You do manage to just kick one of the doors off the hinges.
1229900	1232580	I mean, obviously it gets a bit damaged in the process,
1232580	1234540	but there's enough of it that you can use it
1234540	1236340	as a flotation device.
1238260	1240620	All right, I'll take the door.
1241580	1242940	I'll float on the door.
1243780	1245140	You're the perfect size for it.
1245140	1247300	Well, I am quite big, but we need the dock.
1247300	1248780	How big are you, Freddie?
1248780	1252100	I'm smaller than you.
1252100	1255020	Look at us standing here.
1255020	1257260	You're right, I can tell in an instant that I'm about,
1257260	1259820	you know, if you had to put us on a scale between
1259820	1263300	zero and a hundred, I'd be about an 80.
1263300	1265420	Yeah, I'd be somewhere around 60,
1265420	1267300	probably 20 less than you.
1267300	1269180	I reckon I'd be about a 60 also.
1269180	1270780	Me and Freddie look about the same.
1270780	1271620	Yeah, we're about the same.
1271620	1273340	We're like three quarters of your size.
1273340	1275060	Unfortunately, we need the doctor.
1275060	1276980	So maybe you should go on the door, Freddie.
1276980	1277940	All right, that's fine.
1277940	1280580	And he puts the door at the top of the stairs
1281420	1284460	and sits down on it and says, Rosebud.
1285860	1288140	I don't think we get that reference yet.
1292060	1295380	Now, I do want to say now with Dr. Rothstein down there
1295380	1298260	floating on his crate in the dark and the others,
1298260	1300620	you've heard the other's voices, they've come down,
1300620	1301740	they've gone back up.
1301740	1304700	They're having conversations up above.
1304700	1306900	You can hear little snippets every now and then.
1306900	1310980	They're talking about doors and boats and stuff like that.
1310980	1312820	And then they come back down,
1312820	1316460	but they just seem to be leaving you down here
1316460	1318700	and in the dark on your own.
1318700	1322060	And this acid is just eating you away.
1322060	1325100	Carl thinks it's time to take matters into his own hands
1325100	1328900	and really focuses on trying to get to a wall.
1329060	1332340	I think if you're trying to then just focus your mind
1332340	1335420	like that, that's going to be a sanity role
1335420	1337380	just to see whether you can gather your wits
1337380	1338740	because at the moment, yeah,
1338740	1341620	and just everything is overwhelming you.
1343460	1345780	I'm pretty overwhelmed still.
1345780	1346940	Yeah, that's not good.
1346940	1349380	Then you'd lose another point of sanity as well.
1351180	1354980	Just in your mind, there's something about this.
1354980	1357460	I mean, you've seen the way space gets warped
1357500	1361740	by the Hawke's Device and the way that it's torn through
1361740	1366300	to other realms and what if there aren't any walls down here?
1366300	1370980	What if you've seen how all that's leaked out
1370980	1372100	from the Hawke's Device,
1372100	1376660	how it's brought other parts of this realm here.
1376660	1378460	What if you're not in the cellar anymore?
1378460	1381660	What if you're somewhere else just floating away
1381660	1385180	further and further away from everything that you know,
1385180	1387580	everything that's real, just getting lost?
1389940	1391660	Don't fucking listen to him, Luke.
1398380	1400260	No, I don't think I'll think that.
1410020	1411900	Oh shit, dude.
1411900	1416140	Yeah, Carl just continues in a circle.
1420020	1421820	While spiraling in his mind.
1421820	1425900	Yeah, in my just like, in fact,
1425900	1430900	I just sit down on the raft like with my head in my hands.
1431180	1433300	Actually, that's not a bad strategy
1433300	1436100	because at least it's got your leg out of the acid now.
1436100	1441100	I didn't realize you were doing it to yourself.
1450900	1455900	So meanwhile, we have Freddy riding a door to victory.
1456860	1459740	You've got the door, you've got it down the stairs.
1459740	1463860	You can use it as a fairly unsteady raft.
1463860	1466700	I'm probably going to ask for a Dex roll at some stage.
1466700	1467540	Perfect.
1467540	1471180	You can hear things moving around in the water.
1472300	1475340	You know, some big things, some small things.
1475340	1479140	You can hear the sound of the young girl crying.
1479140	1480580	And now that you're down here
1480580	1484180	and you've got a better ear for what's going on,
1484180	1487180	you are 99% sure that the voice you can hear
1487180	1488460	is that of Esther Frain.
1488460	1491220	Esther, Esther, we're coming for you.
1491220	1492540	We can help.
1492540	1495180	Karl, Karl, we're here.
1495180	1496100	I'm here.
1496100	1497860	We're going to get you back out of here.
1497860	1498700	Hello?
1504220	1505540	Nevermind, just Esther.
1505540	1506900	I'm only here for Esther.
1510700	1511900	Oh, hi.
1513740	1514700	I'm here.
1514700	1516740	Yeah, you sound like you're losing your mind.
1516740	1518780	Well, it also sounds like he is somewhere
1518780	1520380	completely different in the cellars
1520420	1522900	and where Esther's voice is coming from.
1522900	1525780	So who are you heading towards?
1525780	1527260	Who's closer?
1527260	1528660	I mean, it's difficult to tell.
1528660	1531900	I mean, you're judging this entirely on sound.
1533340	1535060	Rothstein's voice is a bit muffled
1535060	1538260	because he's obviously not in the same room as you.
1538260	1540540	Esther's voice is quiet, but then again,
1540540	1545020	she's a little girl and you don't have any visual cues
1545020	1546660	to really get your bearings.
1546660	1548540	Yeah, I'm going after Karl.
1549540	1550380	Okay.
1550380	1551220	First.
1552580	1557580	Then, okay, you splash your way through this noxious,
1558020	1559940	really acidic liquid.
1559940	1563780	I mean, by the time you catch up with Karl,
1563780	1567740	you are going to take one hit point's worth of damage
1567740	1569620	from chemical burns.
1569620	1570860	You are covered with this
1570860	1575340	and as some of the liquid splashes up over the doors,
1575340	1579300	every now and then you can feel things wriggling in it.
1582620	1584060	That's unsettling.
1584060	1586660	Well, then I guess you better make a sand roll.
1590180	1591740	12 on a 63.
1591740	1593980	Okay, you don't lose any sand.
1595060	1596300	Nice.
1596300	1597140	He's focused.
1597140	1601940	Frederick Millen I is nothing if not focused
1601940	1605020	and he is going toward Karl Rothstein.
1605540	1607060	He thinks two heads are better than one
1607060	1609660	for continuing our journey
1609660	1614540	and collecting as many children as possible
1614540	1617620	to save them specifically.
1617620	1621100	You splash your way through the liquid
1621100	1625700	and eventually navigating around a couple of open doorways.
1625700	1630500	You do eventually find this little sort of cul-de-sac where...
1630500	1634420	Can I like make marks with my spade from the tool shed
1634780	1638300	on all the doorways that I'm crossing through
1638300	1639140	on the hallways?
1639140	1644140	I'm trying to make marks in the membrane to mark my path.
1644380	1645980	Sure, okay.
1645980	1648380	I mean, obviously you're navigating by touch,
1650380	1651220	but you can try to feel for these.
1651220	1652500	Oh, right, because it's pitch black.
1652500	1653980	It is pitch black.
1653980	1655460	But I mean, you can leave marks
1655460	1656780	that you can try to feel again.
1656780	1659580	Deep wounding gouges.
1659580	1660420	Exactly.
1661260	1666260	But yeah, yeah, you do eventually find Karl
1667300	1671660	down this little cul-de-sac.
1671660	1672780	Karl, thank God.
1673740	1674860	Who is it?
1674860	1677900	Oh yeah, he couldn't recognize me from my voice.
1677900	1678740	That makes sense.
1678740	1680420	It's Frederick Millen, the voice.
1681660	1685300	Oh, I get my lighter out and flick it
1685300	1687540	so that we can see each other.
1687580	1690780	And he is just a wide-eyed, huge smile.
1690780	1694860	You can see that, yeah, Rothstein in the light,
1694860	1699860	yeah, his skin is just red with burns and blisters.
1700980	1703220	His eyes are swollen up.
1703220	1705140	We gotta get you to the real Dr. Asap.
1705140	1708580	You swear you can see things wriggling in his wet hair.
1708580	1712260	Maybe just run a comb through those locks real quick.
1712260	1714300	Just like shake it out.
1714300	1716740	I run my hand through my hair
1716780	1719300	and some of it just falls out into my hand.
1719300	1720140	Yep.
1722380	1723220	We gotta go.
1723220	1727180	And so he'll put his heels on your raft.
1727180	1731900	Lock your legs with mine, put your legs on my raft.
1731900	1736700	That way we both got heels on the other one's raft.
1736700	1740540	I continue sitting down, just looking up at you.
1740540	1742360	Karl, Karl.
1743300	1744180	Whatever.
1744180	1746440	Karl, you fucking idiot, we don't have much time.
1746980	1748880	You put your fucking heels on this raft right now.
1748880	1750200	We got children to save.
1750200	1751040	We're here.
1751040	1751880	You hear me?
1751880	1753400	If you've given up, if you've given, look at me.
1753400	1754720	See, I am here forever.
1754720	1757320	That's on you, but there are other people down here
1757320	1760640	who have not given up and we are going to save them.
1760640	1761480	You hear me?
1761480	1763400	We are going to save them.
1763400	1766680	Okay, you lead the way then.
1766680	1768080	And I just keep sitting.
1771200	1773960	I'm gonna give you until the next room to start helping.
1773960	1778960	So is Rothstein attempting to follow Freddie or?
1783960	1787960	I thought that, are you staying on my raft or taking yours?
1787960	1788800	No, no, no.
1788800	1790320	I've still got my heels on your raft.
1790320	1794320	So I'm trying to like, I'm trying to paddle backwards
1794320	1796480	and drag you along with me, I guess.
1796480	1798920	But I'm literally only giving you one more room
1800380	1801920	and then I'm leaving you.
1801920	1804120	Well, then I think, you know,
1804120	1806160	particularly as you're not getting any help
1806160	1811080	from Rothstein here and you're trying to pull both of these,
1811080	1814560	I do want to roll just to see whether you can do this
1814560	1816800	without upsetting your raft.
1816800	1820400	And I think actually, because this is a feat of strength,
1820400	1822360	let's do this as a strength roll.
1822360	1823920	Yeah, that's worse.
1825280	1828640	It's also Robin at Men in Tights style strength of feet.
1828640	1829480	Oh.
1833600	1838320	Okay, so I rolled a 52 on a 40.
1838320	1841120	So I am going to spend 12 luck.
1841120	1842520	Oh, okay.
1842520	1844240	Rather than pushing this roll.
1846120	1847160	Nice.
1847160	1849800	So yeah, I mean, your feet almost slip off.
1849800	1852000	I mean, this is really slick.
1852000	1854280	And yeah, in the little bit of light
1854280	1858080	that you've seen from Rothstein's Zippo.
1858360	1860200	Yeah, I mean, this is absolutely smeared
1860200	1862520	with what is undeniably shit.
1869680	1870520	Awesome.
1871640	1873680	And you've been feeling your way through.
1876560	1878800	Rothstein, you don't happen to have like a snack on you
1878800	1880360	or anything, I'm kind of hungry.
1882080	1884280	They are just snacks in here.
1886400	1887360	Oh, fuck.
1888200	1890640	Once we get to the next room,
1890640	1894400	I kind of snap out of it and I look at Frederick.
1895760	1897360	But what do you want me to do?
1897360	1899440	I've got an idea.
1899440	1902800	You asked me a question and proposed your own,
1902800	1904800	like you're about to keep talking.
1905680	1908240	We don't have time to discuss how to talk.
1908240	1909320	And that's a statement.
1909320	1910800	So what's happening?
1913000	1918000	If we kick the stomach, maybe it will throw us up.
1919080	1921280	Okay, let's go get Esther.
1921280	1923880	She would get thrown up too, saved us time.
1923880	1926560	Let's make sure she's with us when that happens.
1926560	1930120	I stand up and start helping,
1930120	1931800	but as soon as we get close to a wall,
1931800	1933000	I'm gonna start kicking it.
1933000	1934960	But I don't tell him that.
1934960	1938200	When you say stand up, you mean in the liquid, do you?
1938200	1943200	Because it's not really feasible to stand up on the raft.
1943240	1946960	Then I just paddle with my leg or whatever,
1947040	1948640	but don't stand up.
1948640	1950200	Thank you for finally helping.
1950200	1952040	Okay, now let's go.
1952040	1957040	Let's, I mean, you're trying to get to the sound
1957760	1960760	of Esther's crying as quickly as possible.
1960760	1965760	Let's again, I think do this as a strength roll.
1966440	1971440	So one of you can make this whichever one of you wants.
1971680	1973000	What's your strength?
1973000	1974440	I'm pretty weak.
1974440	1975480	I'll do it.
1976480	1977960	Okay.
1977960	1980400	Because I mean, you'll get there either way,
1980400	1982600	but it's just a question of how much damage
1982600	1985440	you're going to take on the way from the acid.
1985440	1986960	How long it all takes.
1989520	1991360	47 on a 50.
1991360	1992440	Ooh.
1992440	1997080	So yeah, you each take one hit point of damage
1997080	1999920	from the acid as you make your way across.
1999920	2000760	Ouchie.
2000760	2002360	I'm down to three.
2002360	2005040	The skin is like completely gone from my foot.
2005960	2009400	You can feel you're not quite getting the full range
2009400	2012680	of mobility that you used to get in that foot now.
2012680	2016800	And it's probably best not to try to think too hard
2016800	2018320	about why that is.
2023440	2026480	But yeah, you make your way over.
2026480	2031160	Are you still using Rothstein's lighter for light
2031160	2033400	or are you just checking that on when you need it?
2033400	2034560	I'm keeping it on.
2034640	2035480	Okay.
2035480	2036480	So you keep it on.
2036480	2038600	And yeah, as you get over,
2038600	2042320	you can see over in the far corner,
2043240	2047560	what seems to have been done is someone has built,
2047560	2050840	it looks almost like a jail cell there.
2050840	2053360	There are metal bars that reach all the way
2053360	2054640	up to the ceiling.
2054640	2058760	I mean, obviously the liquid is as high in there.
2058760	2063760	You can see that Esther is there on top
2064720	2069200	of a crate that she's sitting on top,
2069200	2071440	just huddled, looking panicked again.
2071440	2074000	She's quite badly burnt.
2074000	2079000	There is also a shape floating in the liquid beside her,
2079680	2084520	which yeah, it takes a little while to identify it
2084520	2086320	even as being human,
2087280	2089800	but there isn't really that much left of it.
2089800	2090640	Esther!
2091640	2093600	Can you get me out of here?
2093600	2095440	Can you get me out of here?
2095440	2098880	Yes, Frederick says confidently
2098880	2101480	and begins paddling quicker and quicker
2101480	2103680	to get to the metal bars.
2103680	2108680	Yeah, you get up to the bars and yeah, there's a door.
2109960	2111960	Now that you're closer in the light,
2111960	2116960	you can see the figure that's floating face down maybe.
2117360	2119680	I mean, it's difficult to tell anymore.
2120680	2124760	It has got the remains of curly red hair on its head.
2124760	2127720	Yeah, we didn't make it in time.
2127720	2128800	Don't look down, Esther.
2128800	2129640	Just look at us.
2129640	2130480	We're here to save you.
2130480	2135080	It's me, Frederick Mellon the first, your favorite,
2135080	2139120	and Karl Rothstein, your fifth favorite.
2139120	2144120	After the dead person in the water.
2144160	2147960	After the dead person in the water.
2150160	2152120	Nathaniel Coombs and Thomas Tullock.
2154120	2157640	And yeah, I mean, you make it to the door
2157640	2159600	and that's the point at which you realize
2159600	2161640	that the door is locked.
2161640	2162480	Well, perfect.
2162480	2163680	I'm the man for the job.
2163680	2164520	It's a good thing I'm the one
2164520	2166040	who came down here on this door.
2166040	2169520	And that the lock is not visible
2169520	2171560	above the surface of this liquid.
2171560	2175720	Oh, I spoke too soon.
2180160	2181560	I mean, I'm still the man for the job,
2181560	2182680	but I wish I wouldn't.
2184440	2186600	I've been in the water.
2186600	2189240	It's be careful.
2189240	2190360	All right.
2190360	2194400	You know, I'm doing it.
2194400	2196280	Like he's not gonna not do it at this point.
2196280	2198120	He's gonna just go for it.
2198120	2202400	Yeah, you reckon that the lock is at least a foot
2202400	2205000	below the surface of this liquid
2205000	2207240	and that the only way you're going to get an angle on it
2207240	2209120	is going to be to get off your raft
2209120	2211560	and basically stand there up to your neck in this liquid
2211560	2212720	and try to do it.
2213760	2215920	How do you get a door off?
2215920	2216760	What?
2216760	2218720	How do you sexually pleasure a door?
2223120	2223960	How?
2223960	2226600	Because he said the only way to do it is to get it off.
2227560	2228400	Get it?
2228400	2229240	Do you get it?
2233240	2238200	So, what is your plan?
2238200	2239280	Are you trying to pick the lock?
2239280	2242000	Are you trying to go for the hinges?
2242000	2242920	What are you doing?
2242920	2247320	Frederick Millen I knows the best way to break into things.
2247320	2249160	So can I make an intelligence roll
2249160	2250880	to see which would be easier for me?
2250880	2252560	You don't need to make an intelligence roll.
2252560	2254960	I'll tell you that if you're going to pick the lock,
2255000	2257640	that's going to be a locksmith's roll.
2257640	2260640	If you're going to try to get the hinges,
2260640	2262720	you don't necessarily have the right equipment.
2262720	2265200	So that's going to be a hard mechanical repair roll.
2265200	2266560	Well, I'll tell you what,
2266560	2271560	between having a 70% chance and a 10% chance,
2273840	2278720	I will go with the 70%.
2278720	2283720	Okay, so can I lay down belly first on my door
2284400	2289400	and then put my hands like armpit deep into the wet?
2291960	2293600	It's far enough down that if you would try
2293600	2294800	to reach down that low,
2294800	2296840	you'd be putting your face in this liquid.
2299440	2303360	All right, then he does that first.
2303360	2306520	Could try to feel around, doesn't quite get in there.
2306520	2309400	And then he's like, ah, fuck, ah.
2309400	2312400	It's more like putting your face in battery acid.
2312400	2313240	Yeah.
2313720	2316080	He's not going to actually,
2316080	2318400	he's just feeling for the lock.
2318400	2320480	When his nose is about to touch it,
2320480	2322880	he's like, oh no, okay, I got to get in.
2322880	2324680	I understand now, right?
2328680	2329680	I'm with you, Scott.
2331040	2332440	You said, I'm going to do that first.
2332440	2334920	I was like, you're going to dip your face in the acid first?
2334920	2336000	So it's more like.
2338720	2340640	It's like dunking for apples,
2340640	2342440	except the apples are turds.
2343280	2345520	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
2351160	2352000	Yeah.
2352920	2353760	Okay.
2353760	2355320	So yeah, go face first.
2355320	2359600	Well, Frederick Mellon is not, no Lou Reed.
2359600	2363120	So I'm going to go ahead and get off the door.
2363120	2364320	Okay.
2364320	2365240	What was it Thomas?
2365240	2366520	How do I get off the door?
2367440	2369280	That's what you got to figure out.
2369280	2371000	Oh, you jiggle it snob.
2373360	2374360	Oh, damn it.
2377800	2378800	God damn it.
2386080	2386920	Thank you.
2386920	2390360	That's been pretending to be people with Scott Dorver.
2394240	2395960	All right, I'm going feet first.
2395960	2398920	So yeah, you slide off and yeah,
2398920	2401840	you can, I mean, you're not that tall,
2401840	2405480	but you can just keep your head above the liquid
2405480	2406560	as you work.
2406560	2408840	I mean, you're having to stand on tiptoes to do so,
2408840	2409840	but you can.
2412040	2412920	Oh, thank God.
2412920	2414000	I was just really right.
2414000	2416520	28 on the 70, so hard success.
2416520	2418680	Oh, that's a hard success, which is good.
2418680	2420560	So yeah, I mean, there, I mean,
2420560	2422880	you're fumbling around with your tools,
2422880	2425480	unable to see working with this acid
2425480	2427880	just burning into your skin,
2427880	2431240	but eventually you can feel the tumblers
2431560	2436000	click into place and you can pull the door open.
2436000	2438480	As you do so, the liquid moves
2438480	2442360	and the floating remains of Billy Spitzer
2442360	2445360	just float out past you disintegrating,
2445360	2448480	you know, bits of his body going in different directions.
2448480	2450320	Fuck.
2450320	2454320	So he's like, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,
2454320	2456080	yay, oh no.
2456080	2458960	Yeah, what I'll say is for the time
2458960	2460920	that you're in the liquid doing all this,
2461480	2464160	take a D3 hit points of damage.
2464160	2465000	Okay.
2467560	2469000	As you are digested.
2470000	2474520	So I'm down to eight hit points from digestion burns.
2474520	2476440	But yeah, I mean, Esther is there.
2476440	2479840	She's still perched on top of this crate precariously.
2479840	2482840	That's just looking, trying very hard
2482840	2485600	not to look at the remains of Billy as they float out.
2485600	2488080	Eyes on me, Esther, eyes on me, okay?
2488080	2489560	We're gonna get you out of here now.
2489560	2492760	Look at me, can you tell me, does that flake croak?
2492760	2495680	Oh, fuck, I'm losing my mind.
2495680	2497120	Does that crate float
2497120	2499680	or is it just sitting on top of something?
2499680	2501840	I don't know, Mr. Hut, I don't know.
2501840	2504720	Is there anything around that looks like it floats
2504720	2507040	that we could put her on the door?
2507040	2509840	You also don't know yet that a child
2509840	2511360	will overweight the door.
2511360	2512920	That's a good point.
2512920	2516000	Jack weighed down rows, that wasn't gonna work.
2516000	2518160	But those were- He wouldn't have.
2518160	2519320	I know, he did it dumb.
2519920	2521160	So if this kid is smart,
2524040	2525320	you guys should be fine.
2526400	2528200	Okay, thank you.
2528200	2530320	That makes me feel better.
2530320	2534320	So Frederick will kind of push forward.
2534320	2537440	Okay, just like gently shift your weight
2537440	2539400	from off the box onto this door.
2539400	2540800	Well, I think with you guiding her,
2540800	2542360	let's have you make a Dex roll
2542360	2545960	just to see whether you can do this without capsizing.
2545960	2548480	Art seven, I am rocking.
2548480	2549640	Fantastic, okay.
2549640	2552040	So you can get both her and yourself on the door
2552040	2553560	without capsizing it.
2553560	2555640	All right, Carl, let's get the fuck out of here.
2555640	2557040	I start kicking the wall.
2557040	2562040	You kick the wall and something in your foot goes crunch.
2562800	2566000	It's probably best not to think about that at the moment.
2566000	2566840	Ooh.
2568760	2573760	So you managed to kick your way over to the door.
2573800	2574800	I mean, in the process,
2574800	2577480	you are going to take another one hit point of damage each.
2577880	2578960	Okay, I'm down to two.
2579960	2584400	Okay, and yeah, you are going to have to help
2584400	2586440	Dr. Rothstein up the stairs
2586440	2589040	because the foot that he's been kicking
2589040	2591160	with and navigating with,
2591160	2594320	there isn't really much of it left anymore.
2594320	2596000	There's certainly no flesh on it
2596000	2600080	and a lot of the bones have dissolved away.
2600080	2604160	It's less of a foot now and more of a nub.
2604480	2607320	Oh, God.
2608680	2611840	Jesus, okay, so he'll kind of like,
2611840	2614720	Fredrick is just kind of like taking on both of them,
2614720	2617520	you know, and is Esther strong enough to just?
2617520	2620080	Yeah, you can help her up the stairs.
2620080	2622880	If they get to the stairs, me and Thomas are there.
2622880	2624960	I can help grab people.
2624960	2627960	Fantastic, okay.
2627960	2631400	Well, I mean, Dr. Coons, as he grabs hold of Esther,
2631400	2633280	yeah, you can start helping her up the stairs.
2633600	2634920	You've got hold of her.
2634920	2638000	What you do notice as you're helping her up the stairs
2638000	2639800	is under your hands,
2640760	2645320	you can feel things moving beneath the surface of her skin.
2646760	2650280	I try and make eye contact with one of the other guys
2650280	2652880	and give kind of a knowing nod.
2652880	2654320	We'll be able to take care of you.
2654320	2657600	This is going to be okay.
2657600	2658920	Where's Billy?
2658920	2659760	Did you get Billy?
2659760	2661720	He was shaking my head like.
2661760	2664200	Ixnay on the, Billy Bae.
2664200	2666080	What do you mean, what?
2666080	2669640	Don't, no, no, just help her.
2669640	2670560	You went down there.
2670560	2673480	I punched the dog in the side of the arm.
2673480	2675920	Esther seems to be pretty much in a fugue state
2675920	2677240	at this moment.
2677240	2681320	And by the time you get everyone back up to the kitchen,
2681320	2684160	there's now enough light that, yeah,
2684160	2687800	you can see that there are things now moving around
2687800	2689240	underneath her skin.
2690240	2693960	You can also see that this is also very much true
2693960	2696920	of Dr. Rothstein and Freddy.
2696920	2701480	Oh, no, guys, I don't know what to say.
2701480	2704760	Clearly you've got things moving under your skin,
2704760	2706040	probably those bugs.
2707040	2709960	What if we try to force up them out of you?
2709960	2712720	Do you consent to that?
2712720	2714520	The things you can see moving around
2714520	2716920	are much, much smaller than that.
2717920	2722480	In fact, what Thomas thinks of very much
2722480	2724160	is the thing that he saw crawling out
2724160	2725880	of the man's eye outside.
2728360	2732360	Doc, do we just shove them down the stairs?
2736720	2738360	And hope they get digested?
2741400	2744880	I can't, I swore on oath.
2744880	2749880	I don't know, but we can't let that get into the camp.
2751960	2753840	All right, you guys ready to go?
2753840	2754920	One second.
2757960	2760120	I need to get to a hospital.
2760120	2761480	I'm as good as a hospital.
2761480	2764800	You're okay in my hands.
2764800	2769400	But they have with medicine, I'm in pain.
2769400	2770960	And then I point at my foot.
2771000	2771840	Oh.
2774360	2777600	Yeah, like I say, foot is overstating it.
2783600	2786200	What if we quarantine them?
2786200	2789080	We put them in the lab back there.
2789080	2790280	We can keep them in there.
2790280	2791520	I can run some tests.
2791520	2792680	Quarantine who?
2795080	2795920	Hold on.
2795920	2797600	The little girl?
2797600	2799640	Yeah, yeah.
2799640	2800480	Why?
2801360	2803840	She's got some things moving around under her skin.
2803840	2806880	Oh, that doesn't sound good.
2808440	2809280	Right.
2810800	2814040	I truly support quarantine for that.
2814040	2817560	For anybody who's got things moving around under the skin.
2817560	2818960	Oh my God.
2818960	2820800	This would be no exercise.
2820800	2822720	Doc, you know what I just noticed?
2824160	2825120	This is crazy.
2825120	2826640	You've got them too.
2826640	2827640	No, I don't.
2828560	2830400	No, yeah.
2830400	2832400	Yeah, they're there.
2832400	2834800	Maybe we'll start with the little girl as a trial
2834800	2836000	to see how it goes.
2837360	2839200	Why don't you, okay, yeah.
2839200	2842160	Why don't you be the one in there observing her?
2842160	2844120	There should be exceptions.
2844120	2847920	So with the idea that we got like a few minutes to end this,
2847920	2850800	what is your plan at this stage?
2852880	2853840	Oh God.
2853840	2855880	I mean, I want to kick him down the stairs
2855880	2857080	and let him get digested.
2857640	2862640	All of them.
2863000	2865000	It would be so insanely out of character
2865000	2867040	for Dr. Coombs to be okay with that.
2869840	2871400	Okay, so it's a contested role
2871400	2873360	where I see if I can kick you down too.
2877600	2880760	Now, let me give another idea here
2880760	2884040	because I think we'll probably want to do some wrap up
2884040	2886080	and talk about the scenario and stuff.
2886080	2888760	So are you cool with doing another session?
2888760	2890480	Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2890480	2891320	Perfect, cool.
2891320	2892440	That does give you a week to see
2892440	2893800	whether there's anything you might be able to do
2893800	2895160	about this situation.
2896080	2898800	Yes, maybe sleep on this decision.
2900960	2903960	I'm not saying kicking them down the stairs is a bad idea.
2903960	2906080	I mean, it's probably what I'd do.
2906080	2907840	I think from a role-playing perspective,
2907840	2909000	it's a very smart idea.
2911680	2913920	The only way I'd differ from that personally
2913920	2915640	if I were playing this is I wouldn't kick them
2916160	2918200	down the stairs when there's a nice handy hole in the floor
2918200	2920000	that I could just push them through.
2921800	2924440	My opinion is if I were you, that's what I would do,
2924440	2926440	but you shouldn't do it.
2926440	2927520	Don't do it to me.
2932080	2934400	You've got a week to find out a convincing way
2934400	2936160	to save the girl and yourselves.
2936160	2939200	No, my first thought was to take you down with me.
2946360	2947600	We're pretty well fucked.
2948800	2951080	Not if you guys just stay in this house.
2951080	2954800	I'm not saying that this always ends in the TPK,
2954800	2959800	but I have had actual play reports from other groups
2960800	2964120	that have managed to get into some of the situation than you
2964120	2968280	and actually managed to contrive a positive outcome.
2968280	2971120	It's never happened when I've run it because I'm a bastard.
2972120	2973920	Apparently it does happen sometimes.
2976600	2977680	That's great.
2985400	2987840	30 seconds of absolute silence.
2991720	2994200	You're just waiting for us to talk now, aren't you?
2994200	2995800	Yeah, yeah.
2995800	2998320	I knew it was gonna be Thomas that broke, but.
2999600	3001480	I can see the time in audacity, man.
3001480	3005480	I'm not numbers blind.
3005560	3006600	Is there a word for that?
3006600	3007880	Yeah.
3007880	3011720	Is it neumlexia, neumslex, neumaslexia?
3011720	3014160	Is it, well, it'll be the lex part that's different
3014160	3017680	because lex means kind of letters or.
3017680	3019000	Letter or word, yeah.
3019000	3022480	So dyspneumia or something like that, I guess.
3022480	3023320	Dyspneumia.
3023320	3025880	It's always good to start out with a fun fact,
3025880	3027920	regardless of if we know it or not.
3027920	3028760	Yeah.
3030520	3031760	Regardless of if it's a fact.
3031760	3034120	Hey, listener, Google that.
3035080	3036840	See, you learned something.
3036840	3039040	Welcome back to the middle of this episode.
3040360	3043360	Yeah, and it's been a few weeks since we recorded, so.
3043360	3048000	It's, sorry to interrupt right while we get things going,
3048000	3049280	but it's a dyscalculia.
3049280	3050120	Dyscalculia.
3050120	3054120	Aha, okay, that does make sense.
3055160	3057680	Right, well, now that we've got the rehearsal.
3057680	3058520	Yeah.
3063680	3065440	Like a Snapple bottle cup.
3067280	3068120	That's me.
3069080	3071200	So yeah, last episode, I think we'd left,
3071200	3072880	or rather, last recording session,
3072880	3077360	I think we'd left it so that you'd just recovered Esther
3077360	3079360	from the flooded cellar.
3079360	3081920	Yes, the boys floated away in bits.
3081920	3083920	Yeah, yeah, poor Billy.
3083920	3087120	But Esther, you did manage to get out in one piece.
3087520	3091760	The problem is that there are perhaps now too many pieces
3091760	3095800	that she does seem to be crawling with parasites,
3095800	3098120	as are some of you.
3098120	3100720	We left it, I think, with you in the kitchen,
3100720	3102920	having just made this discovery
3102920	3105760	that basically everyone who's been down to the cellar
3105760	3107920	is now infested.
3107920	3110600	So, what now?
3110600	3113320	Yeah, we were discussing being rightly fucked.
3113320	3114160	Mm.
3115880	3118920	I believe there is a look in Thomas Dolan's eyes
3118920	3122320	that said he wanted to push us down the stairs
3122320	3124440	or through the hole in the floor.
3124440	3126000	Oh yes, yes, yes.
3126000	3128280	And, you know, maybe he does that.
3129640	3131960	Why don't you give me one good reason not to do that?
3131960	3135520	She's a child, we can't just throw her down there.
3135520	3136960	That's barbaric.
3136960	3139280	Regardless of the child, okay?
3139280	3140960	Look at me, look at me.
3141000	3144000	We were up in that room and we talked to this fucking house
3144000	3145680	and you know what we had?
3145680	3146520	A connection.
3146520	3149600	Not what the house wanted.
3149600	3151080	What did the house want?
3151080	3154080	It said a name multiple times.
3154080	3156200	It wanted to talk to...
3156200	3160480	And I start tapping Luke Gintman on the head.
3160480	3163080	Your character name's not- Karl Rothstein.
3163080	3164960	Karl Rothstein, yeah.
3164960	3166560	I start tapping him on the head.
3166560	3169720	Okay, then I push the doctor down the stairs.
3169720	3170920	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3170920	3173000	As you like going to do that, I'm like, no, no, no.
3173000	3174600	He wanted to talk to him.
3174600	3177760	The house wanted to talk to Karl Rothstein.
3177760	3178640	It didn't want to eat him.
3178640	3181040	It was lamenting the fact that it was so hungry,
3181040	3182240	in one man's opinion.
3182240	3185280	I will talk to it.
3185280	3186840	Hello, hello.
3186840	3189000	That's what I'm talking about.
3189000	3190520	I kind of whispered to Karl Rothstein.
3190520	3193320	I'm like, anything to keep them from pushing us down
3193320	3195160	into the digestive acid again, you know?
3195160	3198480	Yes, that was uncomfortable.
3198480	3200400	Yeah, let's go talk to the tongue.
3200400	3203000	Oh, take me away.
3203000	3205440	Yeah, let's see what the tongue,
3205440	3207120	the house tongue has to say.
3207120	3209240	Doc, you don't think we should just push these fuckers
3209240	3210880	down the stairs and be done with it?
3210880	3213120	I mean, I'm a doctor.
3213120	3215200	I would prefer to save people.
3215200	3217200	Yeah, the house is starving to death.
3217200	3218880	You're not going to save the house?
3218880	3221640	The trolley problem here.
3221640	3224120	Two assholes or one house, you know?
3224120	3225320	Which lever are you going to pull?
3225320	3227480	There's a chance that the house knows how
3228080	3229200	to be not a house.
3229200	3232400	Maybe Karl knows something about this house being
3232400	3233840	a person house.
3233840	3235320	That's right, the psychic might be able
3235320	3236720	to help him be person again.
3236720	3238320	All right, well, we got him right by these stairs.
3238320	3240000	It just seems like a real good opportunity
3240000	3242520	to just shove him down there and get the fuck out of here.
3242520	3244000	The stairs also go up.
3245800	3249600	All right, well, can you guys just promise
3249600	3252040	that if this doesn't work out,
3252040	3254280	you'll be cool about coming back down
3254280	3256080	and meeting right here where we are now
3256080	3258280	and then we push you down this test.
3258280	3259120	Sure.
3260240	3262080	We'll be really cool about quarantining
3262080	3265080	in that stone slab where we saw that big fish.
3265080	3266160	We could go into the lab.
3266160	3269200	I'm perfectly fine if you want to put me in the lab
3269200	3270920	after all this is said and done.
3270920	3274240	But until then, let's at least try to talk to the house
3274240	3276360	and see if the house and Karl Rothstein can work out
3276360	3278200	between the two of them,
3278200	3280640	how we can make this a better situation
3280640	3283920	for all the little fishies living inside.
3283920	3284760	Okay.
3285440	3286360	My body.
3286360	3289720	Yes, if you head up stairs again,
3289720	3293800	obviously you can still feel the warm breath of the house
3293800	3296320	moving through the corridor.
3297200	3302200	And as you get back up to the top of the stairs,
3303480	3307920	yeah, there is still that mouth visible in the wall
3307920	3310600	through the double doors of the master bedroom.
3310600	3312160	I don't think we have to be near it
3312160	3314200	in order to talk to it, personally.
3314280	3318240	I open the double doors up and walk into that room.
3318240	3320240	You've, you've wanted to see me?
3320240	3325200	Yeah, there is this long, long breath that just goes,
3325200	3326040	Rothstein.
3331960	3332800	Karl's like trembling.
3332800	3333640	Save me.
3338720	3341320	Where are you?
3341320	3346320	I, I don't know.
3348480	3353480	This is strange and frightening and I am so very hungry.
3356480	3361240	Come closer, Rothstein, come closer.
3361240	3364360	Karl gets a little closer.
3364360	3369360	Okay, you can see the tongue lolling out of the mouth.
3369680	3374160	It doesn't seem to be lashing out and trying to grab you,
3374160	3376080	but at the same time,
3376080	3378880	it is making tentative little explorations
3378880	3382520	in your direction, like this monstrous worm
3382520	3385600	just flapping across the ground.
3385600	3386440	Foreplay.
3388200	3392160	Yeah, Karl is just like inching a little closer, like,
3393040	3398040	uh, um, look, you've got to tell me where you are
3398040	3399960	so I can find you or help you.
3399960	3403440	I, I don't know.
3403440	3406320	I don't know where I am.
3407600	3411320	I don't know who I am anymore.
3412600	3416480	Rothstein, I don't know what I am.
3417880	3420680	It has been so very long.
3422160	3423760	Well, Karl, it seems like you and this house
3423760	3424920	have a lot of catching up to do.
3424920	3427320	So I'm, I'm just gonna split.
3429960	3434640	I think we've got to find the house.
3434640	3435920	Austin Hawks.
3435920	3436880	That's what I said.
3436880	3438280	We've got to find the Hawks.
3439280	3442920	When Karl and Frederick both say Austin Hawks in the room,
3442920	3445840	does the room react to that name?
3447000	3448320	Not especially.
3448320	3451720	Can you describe where you, what's around you?
3452800	3454400	House, man.
3457840	3462000	Everything is so strange.
3462000	3467000	I, I am, I am just so hungry.
3468680	3472320	He says, as his tongue reaches out towards you.
3473240	3474800	I slap the tongue.
3477800	3479760	OK, but you're standing your ground.
3480760	3486240	Yeah, let's, let's do this then as an opposed fighting brawl
3486240	3489400	roll, just to see whether you can discourage the tongue
3489400	3491000	from wrapping itself around you.
3491000	3494400	Because at the moment, this is a little more tentative
3494400	3496680	than his previous attack.
3496680	3499400	But on the other hand, you know, it's still,
3499400	3501040	I think it still wants to eat you.
3503160	3504880	Yeah, I crit, failed.
3506440	3507880	So what, what did you roll?
3507880	3509280	A 44.
3509440	3510200	Oh, that's fine.
3510200	3512240	Oh, that's not, that's Delta Green.
3512240	3513160	That's just a failure.
3513160	3514440	Oh, that's Delta Green.
3514440	3517840	Yeah. OK, I just failed regularly then.
3517840	3520240	Yeah, on the other hand, I rolled a 98.
3520240	3524120	So yeah, you slap at the tongue.
3524120	3527120	You're not exactly a powerfully built man
3527120	3529640	and you're a bit worse for wear.
3529640	3532840	But on the other hand, as this monstrous, flopping,
3532840	3536080	muscular tongue comes towards you, you slap at it.
3536080	3538080	And it just instinctively recoils
3538120	3540040	and slithers back into the mouth.
3540040	3541560	Don't get too close to me.
3541560	3543240	I'm trying to help you.
3543240	3544840	Maybe ask its name, Doc.
3544840	3546480	What is your name?
3546480	3547320	Thanks.
3547320	3550360	You know me, Rothstein.
3550360	3552360	We're all like standing at the doorway.
3554080	3557240	Greek chorus gathered in the corridor outside.
3557240	3558880	Three heads on top of each other,
3558880	3560240	peeking around the corner.
3563520	3566680	You know me, Rothstein.
3566680	3569600	You know me.
3569600	3572880	This is my house, Rothstein.
3572880	3575760	This is my house.
3575760	3579360	Hawks. Hawks, is that you?
3580000	3582640	Yes. Yes, that is.
3583200	3585720	That is my name. Yes.
3585720	3588520	How has this happened?
3588520	3591240	Was it the portal? Yes.
3592200	3595040	Yes, it was.
3595080	3597880	I stepped through and
3597880	3600320	I was trapped there.
3600320	3604360	I was trapped somewhere else
3604360	3608880	for so very long until
3608880	3611640	until I found a way back.
3611640	3614520	Am I back, Rothstein?
3614520	3616280	Am I back?
3616280	3618520	Am I home now?
3618520	3620200	Literally.
3620200	3623320	I'm so very hungry, Rothstein.
3623320	3626120	What sounds good?
3635560	3639720	Oh, Scott almost spit out his tea.
3645360	3647680	I'm so hungry, Rothstein.
3647680	3650040	What sounds good?
3653320	3661400	Bring me something to eat, Rothstein.
3662040	3664600	Bring me something to eat and we can talk.
3665640	3669120	OK, are the rest of the guys like behind me?
3669120	3670960	Are they in the room or where are you guys?
3670960	3673680	We're doing the Beatles photo at the door jamb.
3675360	3677280	Yeah, so you're out on the landing.
3677480	3680960	Actually, the three of you who aren't involved in the conversation.
3681400	3683240	Can you give me listen rolls?
3683240	3687160	Oh, hell yeah, dude, these ears.
3687160	3688680	33 on a 50.
3688680	3690480	Oh, fail.
3690480	3692320	I failed mine.
3692320	3694720	OK, you're fairly certain
3695320	3699280	that you can hear a car coming up the driveway.
3699840	3701920	Everybody hear that?
3701920	3704160	Yeah, the house is hungry.
3704160	3706040	Yes, the house is hungry.
3706040	3708520	But also there's a vroom vroom coming up the bale.
3709520	3712040	We got a we got we got a car coming up the chute.
3712440	3714520	Oh, vroom vroom.
3714680	3718320	Yeah, I didn't look up any slang from this time period,
3718320	3721480	so I figured I'd make it up on the fly.
3722200	3724840	That that that that could be good.
3724840	3728000	It could be somebody who's in on on all this on all this terribleness.
3728000	3732440	And or it could be a bad situation who put Austin Hawks in the portal.
3732600	3734040	So he'd be a good guy to feed to him.
3734040	3735960	Right. And yeah, maybe we feed him to the house.
3735960	3738480	Exactly. Yes, we feed him to this giant tongue.
3738480	3740520	And by the way, around here in these times, they're called
3740520	3741720	Chitty Chitty Bang Bangs.
3745000	3747160	Coombes is going to try and go to the nearest window
3747160	3750480	that would look out toward the drive and see what he sees.
3750760	3754840	Yeah. Yeah. Go out to the window and push the the rather moist
3754840	3757400	and meaty curtains aside and take a look out.
3757400	3761560	And yeah, there is a car inching up the driveway.
3761960	3765520	Does it look is it just driving up like it would drive up normally
3765520	3768040	or is it being sneaky?
3768040	3771360	I mean, the lights are on, so it's not be that sneaky.
3771360	3774360	But on the other hand, it is driving fairly slowly.
3774480	3776760	Yeah, there's definitely a room of room coming up.
3776760	3780200	A Chitty Chitty Bang Bang up the up the chute, like it like you said.
3781000	3786880	The chute. Maybe dinner is delivery tonight.
3793200	3795040	What should we do? Should we should we meet him?
3795040	3797280	Should we meet him at the door downstairs?
3797320	3800160	Maybe the house knows where the guns are in the house.
3800560	3802560	If there were guns in me, I'd know where they were.
3802560	3804600	This house barely knew it was a house.
3805240	3808160	Do you know where guns might be in the house? House?
3809080	3813240	Hawks? There is just no response to that.
3815920	3817400	You know what? That's fair.
3817400	3821240	Does this does this window we're looking at the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang out of?
3821240	3822880	Does it open up?
3822880	3825120	Give me a strength roll to see if it does.
3825120	3828960	I mean, it's not locked, but on the other hand, it is kind of scabbed over.
3829800	3834480	Right. Nope, 86.
3834720	3840760	Yeah, I mean, you try and it almost moves, but there's these fleshy strands
3840760	3844000	that just push it back down again every time you try.
3844080	3846440	I'm just going to shout out to come up here in a minute.
3850120	3854440	So you can see what the car is doing is it's pulling over by
3854840	3862600	the the laboratory outside and in the light that's coming out from the windows of the
3862600	3866680	house, you can see that there is a man who's got out.
3867680	3870840	He's wearing a fairly nice suit.
3871960	3877400	You can't really make out who he is because he's wearing a mask over his face or at
3877400	3881560	least some cloth tied around a bandana, tied around his face.
3882560	3891800	As he gets out, he's got an electric lantern in one hand and you can just make out he's
3891800	3896040	definitely got a revolver in the other hand and he's looking around.
3897240	3900720	I mean, you can't read the expression on his face because all we can see is his eyes,
3900720	3909400	but from his body language, he's cautious, nervous, just trying to, I guess, make out
3909400	3910360	what's going on.
3910600	3912040	He spotted our caddy.
3912360	3917560	He's going to be disappointed when he finds that that skinless monkey creature in the
3917560	3919200	tank is all smashed to bits.
3920840	3922600	Well, you shouldn't just leave those things lying around.
3923040	3926640	Yeah, I mean, if you carry on watching from the window behind, he goes over to the
3926640	3929920	laboratory, opens up the door and heads in there.
3930480	3934920	There's a chance that this person maybe knows more about this stuff.
3935240	3939920	They might have a solution for the little parasite problem we've got on our hands.
3939960	3942560	Do you think it's worth trying to talk to him?
3943040	3944000	As opposed to what?
3945760	3947880	Kidnapping him and throwing him in a house mouth?
3947920	3951880	Yeah, just instant hostility like we would treat most NPCs.
3954920	3960680	Maybe we should talk to him and then back up plan V feed him to the house.
3960960	3961880	I like this idea.
3962000	3963400	I mean, it's pretty zany.
3963520	3966040	It's pretty out there talking, you know.
3967040	3969920	All right, but let's give it a whirl.
3970280	3972640	We don't have any like weapons or anything.
3972640	3975480	So they have numbers.
3976200	3977400	Yeah, four on one.
3977640	3979520	That's a lot of talking we can do.
3979680	3981680	He doesn't know that there's four of us.
3981680	3984440	So maybe one of us could like hide behind the lab.
3984560	3988640	And if things go south, they'll just sneak up on him from behind.
3988880	3990840	Yeah, I'm pretty good at sneaking.
3991080	3991600	Let's try.
3991600	3992280	Let's try that.
3992480	3993480	Let's let's do it.
3993520	3995520	What are you doing with Esther?
3996280	4003120	Throughout this plan, because you do have a frightened and rather ill 12 year old girl with you as well.
4003160	4005320	I just assumed she was sitting on my shoulders.
4007640	4009520	We needed a fourth for the Beatles photo.
4011880	4014720	We could maybe have Esther wait in the car.
4017040	4018160	No other ideas.
4018160	4019520	That sounds like the best one.
4019760	4020440	We could feed it.
4020480	4021800	We could feed it to the mouth.
4021960	4026000	Well, you see, that was kind of the whole point of the day.
4026160	4029680	Yeah, but I mean, now there's this whole mouth thing.
4030120	4035400	I feel like it would be a total waste of time if we gave her back.
4035520	4047200	Yeah, we could have just stayed home, slept, drank bad coffee, gone to a different overville that wasn't being taken over by puppets with no faces.
4047680	4050000	Yeah, but remember when we shot that guy?
4050320	4051400	Yeah, that was crazy.
4051640	4052280	What a day.
4052520	4062760	But with a shotgun call, we threatened to do the same to you.
4062760	4064840	And it's how we got you to come along on this adventure.
4065600	4067440	Esther, look at me.
4068360	4073520	This house is a person and you've been trying to be digested by that person, right?
4076800	4077240	Right.
4077280	4077760	Okay.
4077920	4081440	So what we're going to do is we're going to go down to the front door.
4081720	4082240	All right.
4082480	4086760	And we're going to find a spot for you that seems like you'll be fine there.
4086880	4090920	And you're just going to sit on the floor and you'll be right next to the front door.
4091120	4095200	So on our way out, as we're leaving, you just come with us.
4095200	4097680	We're going to get into a very nice car.
4097760	4100400	When was the last time you were in a nice car, Esther?
4100440	4101320	Oh, don't answer that.
4101320	4102800	It was probably when you were being kidnapped.
4103040	4105360	When would it'll be comfortable?
4108600	4116360	Sometimes when I keep talking, I dig a hole for myself, but I think everything will be fine.
4116400	4116800	Look at me.
4116800	4117640	Everything will be fine.
4117640	4118040	Look at me.
4118040	4119040	Everything will be fine.
4119240	4120080	Everything will be fine.
4120560	4121760	And he just pats her on the head.
4122120	4131320	I think this is a good opportunity for you to make either a charm or a persuade role to see whether you can calm her down enough to sit there and wait patiently while you do this.
4131440	4136920	Uh, well, this isn't great because looking at my homemade character sheet here.
4137000	4138520	I'm going to have to ask somebody else.
4138520	4143040	What are the baseline for charm or persuade?
4143560	4146480	Uh, persuade, persuade baseline is 10.
4147560	4149160	I've got, I've got some charms.
4149160	4150920	I don't know what the baseline is.
4151080	4151880	Regardless.
4151880	4153320	I rolled an 89.
4153640	4155600	Yeah, it is certainly hard than that.
4155600	4159720	I think the baseline for charm is 20, but are you sure it's not 90?
4163160	4165880	Everybody in the world is charming as fuck.
4167920	4169160	It's a useless skill.
4170440	4171760	You know, Call of Cthulhu.
4175440	4190000	So, Esther, she seems to listen to you and she, she certainly goes quiet at this stage, but at the same time, you can see that she's still very jittery and frightened.
4191160	4193200	You're leading her down to the front door, are you?
4193400	4197440	Yeah, this is exactly what kids look like when they know exactly what they're doing.
4198160	4216720	Sure. And yeah, you get down to the front door and at that point, she just looks around, you know, particularly at all the strange fluids dripping down the wall and the squelchy carpet and the strange noises coming from upstairs.
4216720	4221960	And she bolts out of the front door and starts running off into the darkness.
4223200	4229440	I think we might have cut out, yeah, the last thing you said there.
4229880	4232960	Oh, something about into the darkness, which sounds distressing.
4233400	4234720	Yeah, that was upsetting.
4235000	4235240	Yeah.
4235240	4239760	I just said that, you know, she obviously in a bit of a panic as you take it downstairs.
4239760	4241000	Oh, it's still being weird.
4241200	4241720	Oh, shit.
4242040	4242400	Okay.
4242400	4250600	It's like, it was every single time you were saying the thing that matters the most.
4253840	4254560	Is it better now?
4254600	4255520	Looks like it so far.
4255560	4256040	Seemingly.
4256080	4256400	Right.
4256840	4264040	In which case, yeah, the last thing I said was that, you know, she seems to, if I'd just broken up again.
4266480	4267120	It did.
4267120	4269440	It broke up right as you were starting again.
4270960	4271920	Motherfucker.
4271920	4273680	I can obviously miss this story.
4273680	4275360	Timing is incredible.
4275800	4276120	All right.
4276160	4279720	Hey, everyone, just, uh, stop your recording.
4279800	4285240	Uh, we're going to fly to, uh, Britain.
4285880	4287560	Uh, what do you call it?
4287640	4288400	What's the name?
4288760	4291400	We'll be there in just a couple of minutes.
4292000	4293240	Milton Keynes.
4293280	4294160	That's the name.
4294560	4296200	I will be there very shortly.
4297280	4298320	Record the same person.
4298320	4299120	I hope you don't mind.
4299120	4300120	I have a cough.
4305600	4307480	Been a little fevery lately, but.
4310040	4310280	Yeah.
4310960	4311280	Okay.
4311280	4312720	Well, let's try this one more time.
4312720	4313520	It seems to be better now.
4314040	4314520	Right.
4314960	4320440	So yeah, I'm saying that, yeah, she seems to be a bit on nervous, a bit on edge.
4320440	4330440	And as you take it down to the front door, she takes a look around at all the creepy shit in the house and then just in a panic runs out of the house into the darkness.
4330920	4332280	I was afraid that's what you had said.
4333760	4334440	I'm chasing her.
4334680	4336320	I'm just going to call after her.
4336360	4336880	I'm just going to...
4337240	4338760	Esther, Esther, no.
4339200	4340840	Stay with us. You're safer with us.
4341720	4349920	Oh, OK, so you're trying to calm her down as Frederick Mellon I is chasing after her.
4350440	4356120	I mean, I will allow you again to make either a PERSUADE or a CHARM roll, but this is a PUSHED roll.
4356120	4367160	I think at this stage, if you fail this roll, she is going to be so panicked by the situation that she is going to run into real danger.
4369760	4370600	I'm going to...
4371160	4372840	She starts shaking his dice.
4374640	4376720	I'm doing a charm roll.
4376760	4377880	Fantastic.
4379000	4379960	Bedside Manor.
4379960	4380720	I pass.
4381400	4383160	It's a 46 on a 50.
4383640	4384320	Brilliant.
4385080	4394280	OK, so, yeah, as Frederick catches up with Esther and she's run off, she's got into the undergrowth a little bit.
4394880	4406200	But now that she's there in the darkness and can't see what's going on and can hear all the strange things moving around in the garden, she just stops.
4406680	4416840	And as you come up, she turns around and just throws herself at you and just puts her arms around your waist and starts crying.
4416840	4423600	Close to the mover time and we always find a time to shine.
4423960	4430280	This is a song that everybody knows.
4430760	4436720	And when you get older, you're gonna lose your toes.
4438600	4440560	She's supposed to sing Lose Your Toes.
4440560	4441520	That's her line.
4442160	4444000	That was me doing Esther.
4444000	4445800	That was her voice.
4446160	4447920	Lose your toes.
4447920	4449080	It's been a rough day.
4454960	4456240	That's OK, that's OK.
4456240	4457520	And I'm just patting her back.
4458360	4461040	And yeah, she's just crying into your chest.
4461280	4464520	That like grandpa hug where you just kind of like pat.
4464760	4465280	Yeah.
4465440	4473680	And yeah, I mean, every now and then as your parm makes contact with her, you can just feel things squirming around under your hand.
4473680	4479920	Should have fed her to the house.
4483360	4485520	OK, that's OK, that's OK, that's OK.
4486160	4488920	As I look around my surroundings, where am I at?
4489440	4502520	You're only about 10 feet in front of the house, so you're just on the far side of the gravel drive, just as it's going into, I guess, what used to be an ornamental garden or some shrubbery or something.
4502520	4506440	But, you know, has long since just gone completely wild.
4506920	4511200	Do I notice any movement from over by the laboratory?
4511800	4513880	No, the door is ajar.
4513880	4518520	You can see a bit of light coming out, but you can't see any movement over there.
4518800	4523000	OK, I'm going to get her to the car and get her in the backseat.
4523200	4529320	So when you say the car, do you mean the one that the guy drove up in or the one that you guys brought?
4529560	4531160	Oh, God, no, not his.
4531160	4532800	It's ours, the one that we brought.
4532880	4534920	Because it's been so long since we recorded this bit.
4534920	4541240	Can you remind me, did you park outside the house or did you park on the street outside?
4541320	4556000	We parked about halfway up the chute, facing out back down the chute, and we took some time to get ourselves dug out from out of the mud.
4556000	4557720	I remember now, yes.
4558480	4563320	OK, so, yeah, you can sneak it down to the car and get her in the backseat.
4563680	4565720	Esther, just stay here, OK?
4567080	4570440	We'll be here in two shakes of a chicken's thigh.
4570640	4573000	Should we turn the child locks on?
4574080	4575640	Have those been invented yet?
4576400	4577320	Not for a while.
4577560	4579240	I turn off my walkie talkie.
4581120	4584120	Kids are still dying by the millions on the roadside.
4584120	4589080	They open the door and launch themselves from the car.
4590840	4592040	It was an epidemic.
4595760	4603440	OK, but, yeah, Esther crawls inside and she hunkers down in the foot well and just hides there in the darkness.
4603480	4604600	Nice, very good.
4604640	4607440	OK, so then I'm going to sneak back up to the house.
4608080	4608680	OK.
4609120	4617280	Being careful, if I see any movement from over by the fella, actually, you know what, I'm going to go hide behind his car.
4617800	4619440	That way I can kind of watch his movement.
4619720	4637160	Yeah, now that you're a bit closer, you can hear, yeah, there's the sound of someone basically clattering around inside and swearing and moving big bits of metal out of the way.
4637560	4644520	And just shouting, you know, he seems to be shouting, Brink, you idiot, what have you done?
4645320	4648880	Yeah, fuck yeah, I gained sanity.
4651920	4666120	Carl, if we're doing this talking to him tactic, there's a chance that, you know, this guy, if Astin up there has turned into a house and knows you, somebody coming here to do something at this house might know you, too.
4666360	4668000	That could work for our advantage, right?
4669560	4670040	How?
4672320	4681320	Maybe you could pretend, you know, a little more than you do or in some way, get him to open up a little more, make him think you're on his side or something.
4681320	4681840	I don't know.
4681920	4684120	Yes, easy, easy.
4686720	4687560	Let's do it.
4690080	4693240	So when you say it, what are you doing?
4694120	4701720	Yeah, I mean, should we just get his attention, have him come out of the lab or should we try and corner him in the lab?
4701720	4704360	Maybe we can go to the lab.
4704840	4707080	I mean, what is our ultimate goal?
4707120	4709840	What if I get a pair of overalls, right?
4710000	4717720	And I stop by the lab and I'm like, pistol cleaners, can I see a pistol, sir?
4718040	4722560	And then you guys come and you talk to him.
4722800	4725600	But I will have disarmed him cleverly with my ruse.
4726840	4732720	The problem is that I feel the pistol cleaners usually come on Tuesdays.
4735440	4738560	We can only pray he's too distracted to remember.
4739560	4742600	I feel maybe this is a good start.
4742600	4747000	And then we, how you call it, wing it from there.
4747200	4748800	You asked what the ultimate goal here is.
4748800	4753400	It's to find out if there's a way to remove the parasites from the from hosts.
4754040	4755640	I think that's our number one.
4755640	4761040	And if it's impossible or he doesn't want to or whatever, it may be feeding him to the house.
4761600	4764000	Yes, works for me.
4765160	4768240	Are you going to be pistol cleaning or should I talk to him?
4768280	4769720	I don't think we should complicate it.
4769720	4771240	Why don't you just go try to talk to him?
4771600	4776040	OK, but I will go in and you guys.
4776640	4783480	Maybe do you stay outside or do you come with me to beat holes again?
4783640	4786760	Oh, I mean, if you guys stay, there will be trouble.
4787240	4789320	But if you go, there will be double.
4793080	4800520	OK, how about you maybe stay just within earshot outside and I try to get him outside?
4800520	4804200	Yeah, and we'll keep Frederick over there behind the behind the car.
4804360	4807000	So I'm behind the car, Nathaniel Coombes, Dr.
4807000	4814760	and Thomas Dolan are inside the like entrance of the house waiting within earshot and Carl
4814760	4817800	Rothstein is going to be on the stoop of the house to try to draw him out.
4818040	4825320	Basically, the car is between the front entrance and the laboratory.
4825320	4828760	I mean, if you think of the laboratory as being off the side, so you've got the front
4828760	4833000	entrance, then it goes around the front of the house down to the side.
4833000	4834120	That's where the car is parked.
4834120	4836520	And then a bit beyond there, there's the laboratory.
4836520	4842440	I'm cool with the camera, like panning with me as I like sneak like around so he can't
4842440	4844040	see me as I move.
4844040	4847560	That's that's really easily done because he's very distracted at the moment.
4848120	4853880	But the problem is that Rothstein is going to have to get a lot closer in order to really
4853880	4854840	do anything.
4854840	4855560	I think that's fine.
4855560	4856120	Let's do that.
4856120	4861880	That's just kind of me and Dolan can just form like a henchman line behind you.
4863960	4864680	So if Dr.
4864680	4871400	Rothstein is creeping over to the lab, yeah, as I said, you can hear the sound of this
4871400	4878440	man clattering around inside and just swearing angrily to himself over and over
4878440	4879240	again.
4879240	4887320	Can I, like, peek into the library to see where he's kind of searching through stuff?
4887320	4891160	What I'll ask for is a stealth roll not to be detected.
4891160	4895480	I will give you a bonus die on this because you've got some cover and he's distracted.
4900280	4901400	No, 93.
4902120	4904200	OK, and with a bonus die.
4904200	4907720	So if you roll the tens again and take the better of the two results.
4910520	4911320	83.
4915560	4919880	So, yeah, you creep up, but...
4920840	4921800	Knock, knock, knock, knock.
4924600	4932520	I think it's more that in order to get into position to see this, the light from inside
4932520	4933400	is hitting you.
4933400	4936680	You switch the lights back on inside, it's all fully lit.
4937240	4945080	And yeah, you are just framed there in the doorway and you watch for a moment as he's
4945080	4949720	just rustling around in the wreckage looking for anything he can salvage.
4950280	4957240	And then he notices you out of the corner of his eye, looks over and immediately starts
4957240	4960360	fumbling around for his gun, just shouting, who the hell are you?
4960360	4961080	Oh, don't.
4961640	4963320	No, come on.
4963320	4963800	Calm down.
4965240	4966520	I am the...
4968520	4969880	Tell him you're the pistol cleaner.
4969880	4977080	I'm the pistol cleaner for the estate.
4980440	4987960	At this stage, he's got his revolver in his hand and he just indicates, come in here where
4987960	4988840	I can see you.
4988840	4989480	Oh, good.
4989480	4994200	It's lit up in here and I can clean your gun very easily in here.
4994200	5000040	Kind of look behind me to signal to the other guys, like I'm in trouble.
5000680	5001720	And then I walk in.
5004360	5005320	Are you alone here?
5006200	5006700	Yes.
5008360	5009000	At the moment.
5010840	5012360	He shoots you instantly.
5012360	5017720	I'm going to take that incredible bit of unconvincing acting there as being in character,
5018440	5019480	if you don't mind.
5022920	5025400	So yeah, he's not buying that for a moment.
5025400	5027640	He says, right, who else is here with you?
5028440	5032600	The house is my friend and it's alive.
5032600	5039480	He just looks at you.
5039480	5041320	I mean, you can only see his eyes.
5041320	5047560	I mean, he's got this white silk kerchief tied around his face and he's looking at you
5047560	5048520	over the rims of that.
5048520	5055160	But I mean, even just seeing his eyes, you can see just the undeniable, unmistakable
5055160	5057240	expression of what the fuck in them.
5057240	5059720	If you want to see something cool, I can show you.
5060600	5063480	Who are you and what are you doing here?
5065560	5068040	My name, don't worry about my name.
5069000	5071320	And I'm here to show you secrets.
5072040	5072540	Come.
5076120	5082200	Would you come if this terrible Henry Kissinger, like, surprised you and was like, I have secrets.
5082840	5085080	Got some surprises for you.
5085080	5086280	I'll clean your gun.
5086920	5089320	My name is not important.
5089320	5090520	Come look at the surprise.
5091480	5093640	He says one more time.
5093640	5095400	Who are you and what are you doing here?
5095400	5098360	And if I don't like the answer, I'm going to shoot you.
5098360	5100280	I start backing.
5100280	5102360	How far into the laboratory am I?
5103080	5105800	How far in did you come when he told you to come in?
5105800	5107080	I'm going to say not very.
5108760	5110920	I love it when Luke asks those questions.
5110920	5111640	Super far.
5111640	5120920	I start backing out and I just kind of like wave, like beckon him towards me.
5121880	5122920	This is the way.
5122920	5127560	And then I sprint out of the laboratory as to not be shot.
5128440	5131560	I'm going to give you a chance.
5131560	5136600	I'm going to give you a chance then to dodge and get some cover between you and the gunfire
5136600	5137720	that's coming your way.
5137720	5141480	Yeah, they'll just push us down the stairs and then this episode will be over.
5141480	5145080	I got a 16 on a 25.
5145080	5147000	Okay, so that's a success.
5147000	5149640	So you are getting out of the way.
5149640	5152360	He is going to get one chance to shoot you.
5152360	5158920	But on the other hand, yeah, I mean, he is close enough that it's point blank range.
5160280	5165320	But because you've dodged, it's just going to be a straight roll and he's not really
5165320	5166280	a gunman.
5166280	5168120	So I do fancy your odds here.
5168120	5172120	That's why I didn't recognize the pistol cleaners.
5174920	5178760	On the other hand, 25 is a success, even with the basic skill.
5178760	5187560	So that is one point of damage, minimum damage.
5188680	5191160	Yeah, I mean, clearly that dodge did help.
5191160	5192440	You've dived out of the way.
5192440	5194520	The bullet just wings you.
5195400	5200040	It clips your left arm just as you're diving around the side of the metal door and there
5200040	5201160	is searing pain.
5201160	5206040	But on the other hand, yeah, it doesn't seem to have hit anything vital.
5206040	5212200	You can hear the sound of this man cluttering through the debris that you left in the lab
5212200	5214760	and chasing towards the door after you.
5214760	5218280	Can we see this happening if we're hiding behind the door?
5218280	5223960	You can certainly see in the light that's coming out of the doorway that, yeah, Rothstein
5223960	5228040	darts out, dives out of the way, there's gunfire, and then he staggers.
5228040	5232840	Nathaniel, if he comes through that fucking door, let's just clothesline the bastard.
5232840	5235000	Yeah, yeah, that, yeah, yeah.
5235000	5236840	And so, yeah, we're like preparing a move.
5236840	5240120	I don't know how that works, but if he comes through the door, we would...
5240760	5243720	Yeah, we just want to juke our arms out and surprise him.
5243720	5246120	So you're running towards the door.
5246120	5250360	I pictured us just on the other side of the door at the start, but maybe not.
5250360	5252840	Yeah, I thought you were over by the car, but...
5252840	5254920	Remember, we are the hench line.
5254920	5255720	We accompanied him.
5255720	5257080	We were walking up with him.
5257080	5258200	Oh shit, that's right.
5258200	5260440	You probably were on either side of the door outside.
5260440	5263560	Yeah, we hid back when he was like, yeah, I'm alone.
5264200	5267640	Well, let's see then how well the two of you are hiding.
5268440	5275480	So whichever one of you has got the worst stealth roll, make a stealth roll just to
5275480	5277800	see whether you're going to get the jump on him.
5277800	5278920	I've got 20.
5278920	5280200	Is that the default?
5280200	5280840	Yeah.
5280840	5281560	Yeah.
5281560	5282520	Yeah, I've got the same.
5283160	5285480	So which one of you wants to roll for this?
5285480	5286760	Hit it up, Thomas.
5286760	5290120	Which one of you makes a yelp when the gunshot goes off?
5291400	5291900	Right.
5294520	5295160	38.
5296280	5296680	Okay.
5297240	5298200	On a 20.
5298200	5303880	I mean, it's not catastrophic, but on the other hand, yeah, to get close enough to do
5303880	5308040	this, you're there within the light that's coming out of the doorway.
5308760	5316280	And yeah, as you're getting into position, he is going to get a chance to react to this.
5316840	5323000	And the bad news is because he's got a prepared gun, he is almost certainly going to act
5323000	5324120	before either of you.
5325000	5330680	So were the two of you both lunging into clothesline him or was just one person doing
5330680	5331080	it?
5331080	5332440	I pictured us both.
5332440	5333080	Yeah.
5333080	5333580	Okay.
5334280	5338520	So it's going to be a question of whichever one of you he considers to be the bigger threat.
5338520	5342520	And I think Thomas Dolan is the larger of the two men.
5343560	5345720	So yeah, I'm pretty certain he's going to shoot you.
5345720	5348520	This is going to be point blank range, so we'll get a bonus die.
5350120	5351240	Oh, that's good for him.
5354680	5358280	I just love it when people succeed on their rolls, regardless.
5358280	5363320	Zach, the correct word is irregardless.
5365320	5367000	It's fucking 8 AM.
5367000	5369800	How did you get Andy's frozen custard this early in the morning?
5370600	5376920	I bought it yesterday, put it in the freezer, and I ate it before I got on mic.
5377480	5379480	Breakfast of champions.
5379480	5381560	I had ice cream for breakfast yesterday.
5381560	5383720	Jesus Christ, guys.
5384680	5389160	I had a brownie caramel pecan concrete.
5390280	5391560	You guys look great.
5391560	5396360	I ordered it small, but they said, well, there's a lot of ingredients in there, so we put it
5396360	5397000	in a medium.
5398120	5399400	Hey, thank you.
5401240	5402840	That's the care Andy's takes.
5404600	5406520	All right, shoot me, Scott.
5407480	5413080	So yeah, even with the bonus die at point blank range, the shot goes wild.
5413080	5418680	He is clearly not expecting two of you to jump out at him, even though you've been pretty
5418680	5420040	obvious about it.
5420040	5427320	The shot just goes clanging into the metal door beside you and ricochets back into the
5427320	5427640	lab.
5428360	5434680	And he's standing there with the gun now, just pointing around wildly.
5434680	5438040	Now, are the two of you just trying to deck him at this stage then?
5438040	5442760	Yeah, Thomas Dolan says, should have got that pistol cleaned.
5443240	5450280	Then he takes a big 1930s action swing.
5450280	5450600	Pow!
5451240	5452840	Give me a fighting brawl roll.
5452840	5455960	He is going to try to fight back by pistol whipping you.
5458040	5459960	Oh, that's a better myth.
5463560	5466040	So what did you get on your fighting brawl roll?
5466040	5467640	Because I got an extreme success.
5468520	5469640	I rolled a zero four.
5469640	5470920	Oh, no.
5471640	5472440	13.
5472440	5474360	Very good, but not good enough.
5475080	5479960	If you have enough points to buy that down to an extreme success, I really recommend
5479960	5482760	doing so because extreme successes do maximum damage.
5484280	5485640	Do I spend luck points on that?
5486520	5488520	Yes, yes, if you have enough.
5488520	5491560	I don't think Thomas Dolan does.
5491560	5492280	I think he lost.
5492280	5493560	I don't think you have any.
5493560	5496360	Yeah, I think I lost all my luck.
5496360	5498680	Because I think he may be about to kill you here.
5500280	5507880	Because with maximum damage on this, he does have a damage bonus.
5507880	5510520	So this is going to be 10 points of damage coming your way.
5510520	5511720	Holy shit.
5513720	5515400	Yeah, so I'm at two hit points.
5515400	5518920	Okay, can you give me a constitution roll to see whether you can stay standing?
5518920	5525560	So basically, as you come in to try to deck him, he ducks underneath, brings his gun up,
5525560	5527800	just backhands you across the face.
5527800	5532520	And there is this almighty crunching noise as he breaks your nose and blood goes flying.
5534200	5536120	No, I rolled a 91.
5537080	5538120	Lights out.
5538120	5541400	Yeah, Thomas just goes down with a thump lying on the ground.
5541400	5545960	K.O. Finish him.
5545960	5547320	What was Dr. Coombes doing?
5550360	5554440	Now that he's seen Thomas go down, he's freaked out.
5555000	5557400	No, no, no, no, no.
5557400	5558920	Fucking fight him, you son of a bitch.
5558920	5560920	Yeah, you were attacking him too.
5560920	5563960	And now he's taking all his time killing me.
5563960	5566200	So you've got to fight up a shot.
5566200	5567000	Go for it.
5567000	5568120	He's open, baby.
5568120	5569400	He just took a shot.
5569400	5570520	Fucking chomp that.
5571880	5575160	Okay, the guys want me to hit him with my 25% chance.
5576760	5580200	Because you are ganging up on him at this stage, there are two of you attacking him.
5580200	5581640	You do get a bonus die on this.
5582520	5583020	Perfect.
5584600	5585720	I'm going for a swing.
5589640	5590680	I pass.
5590680	5591400	It's a 22.
5594600	5595880	Okay, doctor.
5597800	5599320	So, yeah, give me a damage roll.
5599320	5600920	You're not using your weapon at this stage.
5600920	5604040	So it's just going to be a d3 plus any damage bonus you've got.
5605320	5606360	It's a three.
5606360	5606860	Okay.
5607400	5607900	Total.
5608780	5614700	So, yeah, you managed to hit him a fairly solid blow in the jaw.
5615500	5619420	And you split the bottom of his lip.
5619420	5622780	There's a bit of blood running out and he staggers back for a moment.
5623660	5625820	And he looks really pissed off about this.
5627580	5629100	He's now going to try to shoot you.
5630060	5630560	What's...
5632620	5638620	When I heard the initial gunshot go off and I saw the two get ready for the hang line,
5638620	5646620	I think Frederick Mellon the foist began his waddle, his quick waddle,
5646620	5650700	right toward the door, getting ready to join in on the action.
5650700	5655340	Yeah, and then I'm going to try to disarm this man.
5655340	5658540	Okay, because again, he does have a gun readied.
5659180	5661660	He is going to act first, I think.
5662220	5664700	Yeah, he is because that's plus 50 on his decks.
5664700	5668860	And unless anyone's got a decks of higher than 115, he's going first.
5669500	5670540	Ah, 110.
5673340	5678300	So I think because Dr. Coombs just punched him, he is going to shoot Dr. Coombs.
5679260	5682380	Let's see how this goes for Dr. Coombs.
5682380	5685820	Okay.
5685820	5686620	Oh, hang on.
5686620	5687260	It's point blank.
5687260	5688300	He gets a bonus die.
5693020	5694460	Oh, no, no, that's...
5695100	5697260	So both my rolls were 84s.
5697260	5698060	So that's good.
5698700	5701340	So yeah, obviously you've discombobulated him a bit.
5701340	5704060	He's staggering back and he's firing wild.
5704060	5711100	The bullet just goes between you and Frederick and you hear it smack into the car behind you.
5711740	5713020	And the little girl is dead.
5713980	5714540	Different car.
5715980	5719500	This guy is backing into the lab again, halting the gun.
5720300	5726620	One thing you can see as well, actually, yeah, because Dr. Coombs got a solid blow on his face,
5726620	5728700	his cachif is coming loose.
5729580	5736780	As he steps back into the light that's coming out of the laboratory, it comes down and you
5736780	5741020	can see that his face, there's something wrong with his face.
5742140	5747900	You can see his mouth there, but the problem is all the other mouths, all these little
5747900	5753180	mouths with teeth that have just opened up all over his face and seem to be screaming
5753180	5755100	in pain from the blow.
5755740	5756860	Oh, my God.
5756860	5761740	I would like everyone who's conscious and not running away, so that's Dr. Coombs and
5761740	5764780	Frederick, to make sand rolls.
5767260	5769180	72 on a 63.
5769180	5769680	OK.
5769980	5770480	Fail.
5771100	5773180	I fail a 29 on a 20.
5773980	5779500	OK, so you don't lose much sand for this.
5779500	5781260	I mean, you see much worse things today.
5783500	5785420	Frederick only loses two points.
5785980	5788300	Dr. Coombs loses three points.
5789100	5794460	But Dr. Coombs, on the other hand, was already indefinitely insane, I think.
5794460	5798780	So this pushes him over into another bout of madness anyway.
5798780	5799420	Oh, OK.
5799420	5802940	I think at this stage it's just going to be pure self-preservation.
5802940	5805260	I mean, there's gunfire going off.
5805260	5808940	You're not someone who is used to combat.
5809740	5811420	You've seen Thomas go down.
5812780	5814780	You've nearly been shot to yourself.
5815980	5819180	I think you're just running away blindly into the darkness.
5819820	5820780	I'd agree.
5820780	5823180	That sounds like what Coombs would do.
5823180	5825980	Yeah, I'm sure you won't get into any trouble out there.
5827500	5828000	No.
5828460	5833260	So that now leaves Frederick on his own dealing with the gunman.
5836940	5837740	Good luck, Freddie.
5838620	5840780	Was I just like running?
5841900	5842940	Well, it's up to you.
5842940	5846300	Yeah, I mean, if you want to double back and help Fred, by all means, you can.
5846300	5846940	Yeah, I think...
5847740	5850540	Well, I'm unconscious, guys, so it's up to you.
5851260	5854220	I'm flinging myself into the woods, so...
5854220	5862300	Yeah, so as I'm running away and get clipped in the arm, I'm like, oh,
5863500	5870780	I feel like I'm down to three hit points and I start running away.
5870780	5878220	But then when I hear the other gunshots and stuff go off, I turn around and I see between
5878220	5885100	Nathaniel and Thomas what is going down and I look to see what Frederick Mellon is doing.
5885100	5887020	And he's going for the disarm.
5888300	5896940	So you're following this man with the many mouths into the lab as he's backing off
5896940	5898780	and you're going to try to get the gun off him?
5898780	5900460	I'm going to try to sneak it away from him.
5900460	5905020	I'm a very stealthy man and I've been known to steal things off of people a lot by misdirection.
5905020	5912940	So I'm going to try to flick a coin in the air and then while he's looking at my hand
5912940	5916140	that's up in the air, just grab the gun out of his hand, maybe.
5917260	5922300	Okay, then what I'll allow then is for you to use sleight of hand
5922300	5924300	instead of fighting brawl for the maneuver.
5924940	5927420	Crazy that I have 10% more in that.
5929580	5933980	On the other hand, he is still going to try to pistol whip the fuck out of you.
5933980	5936220	Dude, I rolled a fucking 10.
5937100	5940380	Oh, that's an extreme success.
5941100	5945420	That's good because he's rolled a 73 on his fighting brawl.
5945420	5946860	So that is a complete failure.
5947500	5951660	So yeah, you have his gun now.
5952300	5959740	He's trying his hardest just to ignore the very obvious distraction that you're doing.
5959740	5963260	But there's just something so compelling about the way you flick that coin.
5963980	5968620	That he's just bringing the gun back to smack you in the face with it
5968620	5972460	and he's just looking up at the coin and then he's looking down at his empty hand
5973020	5978860	and just muttering, oh fuck, not again, to himself.
5982620	5983100	Every time.
5983100	5984220	Decades of practice.
5986460	5990540	And with that, I think on the extreme success, by the time he realizes what's going on,
5990540	5991980	I'm backed out the door.
5992060	5995820	Gun still pointed at him and hollering back to my comrades.
5996540	5997420	I got the gun.
5998540	5999580	He's got my coin.
6002460	6006300	Yeah, he's hesitantly putting his hands up and saying,
6006300	6011260	look buddy, don't shoot, you know, I'm sure we can talk this out, right?
6011260	6012780	Are all the mouth saying that?
6012780	6013500	Just the one mouth.
6013500	6017420	The other ones are just opening, closing all over his face, but it's just the one that's talking.
6018380	6020460	And he's saying, you want money?
6020460	6021260	I can get you money.
6021260	6023100	I can get you all the money you want.
6023100	6023980	I don't want money.
6024620	6028060	I want answers and money too.
6030700	6031340	Oh, right.
6031340	6036940	I forgot about my chief concern in life, which is also stealing money from rich fucks like you.
6036940	6037500	Yes.
6037500	6042060	I also want money, but mostly right now I would like answers.
6042620	6044220	Do you look at my skin?
6044220	6045580	Look at my face.
6045580	6049260	I see that your face is equally fucked up in a different measure,
6049260	6052860	but if you can see my skin, you can see what I've seen.
6052860	6054220	I want it to be different.
6055420	6057180	I want to be fine again.
6057900	6059260	Oh, yeah.
6059260	6059980	What do you got?
6061260	6063660	You got some of the entities inside you now?
6064300	6067100	Yeah, I don't know what you do about that.
6067100	6071820	I mean, those aren't like species 17.
6071820	6074860	I mean, those things, when they go inside you,
6074860	6078060	we can just fish them out and yeah, that's good.
6078060	6080220	But what do you got inside of you?
6080220	6085500	No, we've seen those before and yeah.
6086380	6090620	Look, between you and me, buddy, I was coming in here to clean this place out,
6090620	6096700	take what I could and just abandon it because last night these things got out.
6096700	6101420	Everything got out and this place is ruined now.
6102140	6105740	You know, things like what's crawling around inside you, they're everywhere now.
6105740	6107420	It's too dangerous here now.
6107420	6109500	You'd have to be an idiot to hang around here.
6109500	6112220	Any ideas if your life depended on it?
6114220	6114720	Shit.
6116540	6126380	I mean, I guess they're not from the same dimension as the rest of us.
6127420	6128060	I don't know.
6128060	6133580	You might be able to do something with the Hawke's device and I don't know,
6133580	6137420	just face certain types of matter.
6139900	6141660	It's not something I've ever tried doing.
6142300	6143020	Keep talking.
6143660	6149020	I know Hawke speculated about stuff like that, but I mean, he's gone.
6149020	6152700	Look, this story is currently open, OK?
6153580	6155740	But you're Sedgwick, right?
6156380	6157580	Yeah.
6158460	6159580	You're the closer.
6160700	6164540	I need you to close my story and give me back.
6165900	6166620	Me too.
6166620	6168460	Kira Sedgwick is the closer.
6169740	6170780	Every Tuesday night.
6170780	6176140	Wow, that was, I was so wondering where that was going.
6178860	6183820	I mean, it's lost on me, I'm afraid, but I'm not appreciatively.
6186460	6187980	It might as well be lost on me.
6188620	6190940	No one listening will get that reference.
6194220	6196540	Someone's mom will get that reference.
6200620	6207260	Yeah, I mean, we can try something, but, you know, this place is half trashed now.
6207260	6209500	I don't know that we're even going to get it working.
6209500	6212060	I mean, some idiot pulled the tank over.
6212060	6213820	There's water everywhere.
6213820	6217500	I'm sure it shorted out half the electrical circuits in here.
6217500	6219740	I don't know if we'd even get this working again.
6219740	6225020	Yes, the house is strange and things break.
6226540	6228220	That's not my shoulder talking.
6229420	6230540	That's the man behind me.
6231500	6233500	Yeah, I step out from behind, Frederick.
6233500	6235020	I'm back that you shot me.
6235980	6236460	Fuck you.
6239980	6243420	While you're having this conversation, let's just deal with Dr. Coons.
6244540	6252300	So Dr. Coons is running through the undergrowth, running through the darkness.
6252300	6256780	There's thorns and branches whipping past you, cutting your skin.
6257740	6262940	You can hear things moving in the darkness all around you.
6263660	6267740	You can feel the wet traces of things that you're brushing against.
6267740	6271020	And you don't know where you're going now.
6271020	6273180	You're just running blindly in a panic.
6273820	6276460	So I think what I'd like is a luck roll.
6278300	6278800	Okay.
6279900	6280400	Nope.
6281260	6282300	I've got zero of it.
6283900	6285820	You crashed the four-wheeler into a tree.
6289340	6289840	Okay.
6290540	6294540	So yeah, in all the undergrowth that you've been running through,
6295180	6298700	all of a sudden, your feet go out from under you.
6298700	6302060	And you realize that you've run into,
6302060	6307980	fallen into the remains of what was probably an ornamental pond out here,
6307980	6312460	and just gone splash into this filthy stagnant water.
6313260	6318140	I mean, the good news is that this suddenly brings you out of the panic you're in.
6318140	6322380	There's just this cold, this almost freezing splash of water in the face
6322380	6327900	just shocks you back to some kind of semi-coherent state of mind.
6328540	6332540	The bad news is that you're not sure that you're alone in here.
6336780	6340860	There is something big that you can't see just moving.
6340860	6343420	You can hear the water moving around you.
6343420	6350380	You can feel the currents of water from something a large moving in the darkness with you.
6350380	6352540	Can my feet touch the ground here?
6352540	6353740	Is it that shallow?
6353740	6357580	Yeah, it's not like a little ornamental pond.
6357580	6365420	I mean, this is one that they've obviously dug in the garden because it looks pretty.
6365420	6369580	But let's put this again down to a luck roll.
6369580	6374060	Are you somewhere in this pond that is shallow enough for you to stand up?
6374940	6375440	Nope.
6376060	6376560	Okay.
6378220	6379020	I got the zero.
6382060	6383260	Oh, oh dear.
6383340	6384620	Yes, of course you've got zero.
6385420	6391820	Well, your feet, they try to scrape for purchase.
6391820	6396140	And as you drop down, your head dips down below the surface.
6396140	6401500	You can feel the bottom, the muddy bottom of it down there, but it's just too far.
6401500	6405420	If you stand at the bottom, the water is just inches above your head.
6405420	6408380	Coombes is still in, even though he's kind of snapped out of it,
6408380	6409980	he's still in self-preservation mode.
6409980	6413180	And so he's just going to try and swim to the nearest bank.
6413180	6414780	Try to get out of the water.
6414780	6415820	Maybe a little frenzied.
6415820	6421980	Then I think, yeah, you have one chance then to escape this presence in the pond
6421980	6424060	before it takes a lively interest in you.
6424620	6426220	And that will be a swim role.
6429660	6432220	I fail a 30 on a 10.
6432860	6435180	You don't get many opportunities these days to swim.
6435180	6438460	So you're probably a bit out of practice and you're splashing around in the water
6438460	6439740	and you're fully dressed as well.
6440700	6444860	They're pulling you down and just in the darkness, you don't have your bearings
6444860	6446380	and you're splashing around in the cold.
6446380	6448860	There's just the shock of being in this cold water.
6448860	6454700	But yeah, somehow, I mean, you splash around and you just get to the muddy edge of the pond.
6455340	6457020	But it is muddy, it's slippery.
6457020	6461980	You put your hand on it and you haven't managed to get close enough
6461980	6467740	for you to really get a grip on it before something starts wrapping itself around your neck.
6468620	6475580	It reaches up around your body, reaches up around your neck and it feels soft at first.
6476620	6481820	But then there are all these sharp bits that start digging in.
6487020	6492140	So I think let's give you one chance to break away from this
6493180	6496940	and put it down to an opposed strength roll between you and this creature
6497500	6500780	before it dines on you.
6502460	6504540	This opportunity comes once in a life.
6504540	6507660	I'm imagining this is like an evil cashmere scarf.
6510620	6513900	I pass a 38 on a 50.
6513900	6517500	Okay, yeah, I got an 18 on the 60.
6517500	6520540	So that's a hard success versus your ordinary one.
6521260	6521500	Yep.
6522220	6527980	Looking at this in cinematic terms, we just sort of see this last glimpse of Dr. Coombes
6527980	6531340	as he reaches for the banks, his fingers digging into the mud.
6532220	6537420	And then suddenly there is this violent motion and he disappears below the surface.
6537980	6540300	There is a brief disturbance.
6540300	6546700	There's bubbles that come up and a little froth of something that's not water.
6546700	6550780	But then the water goes very still again and stays that way.
6552140	6554300	So, meanwhile, with the rest of you.
6558700	6560300	Oh my God, dude.
6561340	6561740	Yes.
6563340	6563660	Rip.
6567100	6568140	So, yeah.
6568140	6569340	Thomas, can you play Taps?
6574780	6576140	Is that what you do when people die?
6576140	6582380	That's what they do at the end of the day at the army party.
6583260	6584540	Well, that's every day, baby.
6587580	6590380	Back at the lab, you have Sedgwick at gunpoint.
6590380	6592860	You were discussing what to do.
6594060	6596380	Rosslyn had made his presence known.
6597340	6600700	Dolan at this stage, I think, is beginning to come around.
6600700	6604940	I mean, you've been half awake for a few moments, but you're beginning to get your senses back.
6605820	6608540	That your head hurts like a motherfucker.
6609260	6613820	But your thoughts are beginning to come back together into something coherent.
6614940	6615900	Ow!
6615900	6617580	Fucking role playing, dude.
6617580	6621180	That's Thomas Dolan's main overwhelming thought.
6621180	6623900	Yeah, I mean, this is serious.
6623900	6630140	I mean, whatever he's done to you, I mean, as you're feeling the wound and it's not just a cut,
6630140	6635420	but you're certain that there's bits of your skull moving under your fingers that aren't
6636300	6637180	supposed to move.
6639020	6641180	But on the bright side, you do know a doctor.
6641180	6643980	As long as you can get to him and you should be fine.
6647340	6648940	We are so lucky.
6648940	6651180	We're so lucky we brought Nathan Coombes along.
6651180	6653020	He's just as good as a hospital.
6653340	6660700	I look down at him in Carl's head, he thinks he looks bad.
6660700	6661820	I'm a doctor.
6665180	6666700	Trust me, I'm a physicist.
6671020	6676620	OK, yeah, give me a first aid roll to see whether you can at least keep a skull in one piece.
6677500	6680300	Yeah, I'm not that kind of doctor.
6683900	6686700	Yeah, I think this is...
6686700	6688460	69 on a 40.
6688460	6689020	Oh, that's a criticism.
6689020	6689740	Wait, what?
6689740	6691340	Are we doing that?
6691340	6691980	Oh, yeah.
6691980	6693420	Did he fucking roll a 69?
6693420	6694380	Success, then.
6699020	6700700	You are that kind of doctor, baby.
6700700	6702140	I am that kind of doctor.
6703180	6704380	You're that kind of doctor.
6704380	6707180	So you're 69ing Thomas Dolan back to health, then?
6709900	6710300	Yes.
6713660	6716620	Yeah, he's reinflating.
6716620	6718940	He bends over and reinflates me from the other end.
6723020	6723820	OK, yeah, yeah.
6724700	6726060	Going with your house rule, then.
6726060	6726780	Yeah, we need to...
6727420	6728860	This house does not rule.
6731660	6735660	Well, you can rip up a bit of clothing and just create a bandage to at least
6736620	6738620	stop his head getting any worse.
6738620	6742220	I mean, he is going to need proper medical attention at some stage.
6742940	6747260	But at least you can get him to the stage where he can move around without it being
6747260	6748060	life threatening.
6748060	6753420	I'll pull my lighter out and cauterize his wound and then wrap it up with my sleeve.
6756460	6763420	I'll pick a lighter can cauterize wounds, but you definitely set my hair on fire.
6766300	6768300	It smells glorious.
6768300	6769340	No, it's all right.
6769340	6770540	It doesn't set your hair on fire.
6770540	6772620	There's too much blood in your hair for it to catch.
6773660	6774860	Just kind of singes it.
6781340	6785420	And you do get one hit point back as well for the first aid.
6785420	6785820	Four.
6788220	6788940	No, three.
6790220	6791500	I'm at three, baby.
6791500	6792860	Heck yeah, me too.
6792860	6796780	Now, meanwhile, Freddy has got Sedgwick at gunpoint.
6796780	6799820	You've been talking to him about the situation.
6800460	6807020	Look, OK, if you give me a hand getting all this stuff working again, I don't know.
6807820	6812460	I mean, with all the damage Brink did here, I don't know whether we're going to get it
6812460	6813260	working again.
6813260	6816300	But if we can, I don't know.
6816300	6820380	I mean, maybe we can get these parasites out of you.
6820380	6828460	But there's a good chance that it's all going to go horribly wrong.
6828460	6831660	And you're just going to get lost there.
6832620	6833900	You willing to take that risk?
6834540	6835040	Yeah.
6835340	6836940	Did you go to university?
6836940	6837440	Yeah.
6838860	6840380	Let's give it the old college try.
6840380	6841420	Carl, get in here.
6842060	6844860	I got a psychic back here.
6844860	6847020	He says I helped build all this.
6847020	6849660	I was Hawks' lab assistant.
6849660	6851420	Well, now you got two extra hands.
6851420	6852940	You asked for a hand with it.
6852940	6854540	I've got a gun pointed at you.
6854540	6856220	That's all I'm doing this whole time.
6857100	6859100	What is the plan?
6859100	6862460	You are helping this gentleman fix me.
6862460	6863420	I need fixed, too.
6864540	6868380	Look, and I hold up my arm and it's crawling around.
6869020	6871500	He says, yeah, I've seen those before.
6871500	6874700	They'll suck the life out of you within a day or two.
6874700	6877660	Well, good thing that we're not taking any breaks.
6877660	6884540	Look, OK, if you can help me fix the damage here, work around any short circuits,
6885020	6888060	you know, rewire anything that needs to be rewired.
6890620	6895740	We can try, but look, I understand how to make this thing work.
6895740	6897980	I understand the basics of it.
6898940	6902220	I don't know if I can adapt it to do what you're talking about.
6905500	6906620	I mean, do it or die.
6908300	6912860	OK, well, does anyone know anything about wiring?
6912860	6913980	We both do.
6913980	6916940	Yes, I've been I've turned the portal on before.
6917580	6927260	So, yes, I know about, you know, I read about 25 percent of an electrical repair handbook
6927260	6929820	one time, but I internalized all of that.
6930460	6937340	I would say I have exactly 25 percent of a master's skill in electrical repair.
6937660	6945420	Well, I think then one of you can take the lead in this rewiring job, and I guess it's
6945420	6946620	probably going to be Dr.
6946620	6949740	Rothstein unless you want to play on hard mode.
6952220	6957260	So then let's have an electrical repair roll off Dr.
6957260	6960460	Rothstein just to see whether you can repair the electrics.
6962140	6964060	OK, I got it pretty good.
6964860	6965340	Damn it.
6966220	6967820	92 on a 60.
6967820	6969260	God damn it.
6969260	6976380	Yeah, the problem with it is that, yeah, I mean, when he pulled this tank over and emptied
6976380	6980300	all this water across here, that it has fried a lot of the circuits.
6981100	6986300	And now that it's been here for a while, it's seeped in, you might be able to take some
6986300	6986940	shortcuts.
6986940	6990140	You might be able to just bypass entire sections of it.
6990140	6993020	But, you know, this is an unfamiliar device.
6993420	6995580	You don't know what effects that might have.
6996300	6998780	You could push the roll if you want and try doing that.
6998780	7000220	I'm going to push the roll.
7001020	7006620	I find two exposed wires and look at them and push them together.
7006620	7011420	And, uh, 90.
7011420	7013420	What, really?
7016700	7017340	OK.
7017660	7030220	OK, so let's have it play out like this, that you don't realize how spectacularly you
7030220	7035100	fucked this all up until Sedgwick switches the machine back on.
7037660	7039100	Sedgwick, don't talk like that.
7039100	7042220	I have the utmost confidence in this man right here.
7042220	7042620	Dr.
7042620	7046700	Rothstein's the smartest, most capable doctor.
7047020	7048540	I mean, he can see the future.
7048540	7049660	He's a psychic.
7049660	7051580	So I don't want to hear any of this.
7051580	7052860	Oh, can he do it?
7052860	7054060	Can he do it?
7054060	7055340	Obviously, he got it right.
7056060	7060700	I mean, Sedgwick's really impressed when he hears Rothstein saying, what, you're Dr.
7060700	7061980	Rothstein of the Miskatonic.
7062540	7063500	I've read your papers.
7063500	7064700	I'm sorry.
7064700	7066140	You should have said who you were.
7068300	7071020	Oh, well, you know, I, I, uh,
7071020	7081020	I, you know, I know my name carries a lot of weight, but I try not to throw it around.
7081820	7084540	You know, I want people to like me for me.
7091580	7092700	Well, all right.
7092700	7096060	I mean, obviously, yes, I mean, I'll take your word for it.
7096460	7101340	If you think this is all going to work now, then yeah, let's power it up.
7101340	7106940	Well, as you know, I'm a fucking genius, so there's nothing can go wrong here.
7108060	7108620	Good.
7108620	7109420	Good, good, good.
7109420	7111580	Oh, I feel better about this already then.
7112220	7117900	All right, gentlemen, stay outside the circle for safety, but we should be all right to
7117900	7118940	turn it on now.
7118940	7120220	I give a big thumbs up.
7122620	7125820	And with that, Sedgwick throws the knife lever.
7126300	7128220	And it all sparks into life.
7129020	7134060	Unfortunately, one of the things that you seem to have shorted or at least worked
7134060	7136860	around is this containment ring.
7139660	7140460	Yes.
7140460	7147260	You see this rip in reality form within the ring and spread out to the extent of the
7147260	7148780	ring as it did before.
7149980	7151820	But this time it doesn't stop.
7152380	7156140	And more than that, it is accelerating.
7156140	7161980	I mean, even before you have a chance to turn and start running and leaving the lab, it
7161980	7163340	is just spreading out.
7163340	7170300	Sedgwick is screaming in terror as he just sees the world around him changing and being
7170300	7173660	consumed by these alien dimensions crashing in.
7174380	7181100	You can see the ground around you changing into something that's not quite a marsh, but
7181100	7184220	maybe a marsh is the closest thing that your brain can make of it.
7184940	7186540	And there are things in it.
7186540	7188380	There are things all over the place.
7188380	7193100	You look around for the door, for the laboratory and the walls, but they're not anywhere
7193100	7193340	now.
7193340	7198220	There's just this marsh that's spreading out and these strange clouds and these things
7198220	7201180	moving through the air and moving through the liquid around you.
7202220	7208860	And there are the large things, the large things that you're one of which you saw coming
7208860	7210940	before and you managed to switch the machine off.
7211100	7218060	But now you realize that's just one of a herd and they have you surrounded.
7218620	7224540	Sedgwick is looking around in panic, trying to switch the device off, but the device isn't
7224540	7225340	there anymore.
7225340	7226940	The switch isn't there anymore.
7227900	7229260	There is nothing to turn off.
7230300	7238860	And just with a look of absolute defeat, he just collapses down into the muck and starts
7238860	7239340	crying.
7240220	7241340	What do the rest of you do?
7241340	7243500	I want to start running out of the room.
7244620	7245900	There isn't a room anymore.
7247180	7247820	What room?
7251660	7251900	Yeah.
7253100	7254300	How do you want to go out?
7255740	7256700	That's pretty much it.
7257660	7257980	Yeah.
7258700	7262220	I turn to Freddy and how many bullets are left?
7262780	7263900	I got two.
7263900	7266140	I hear that and I grab the gun and say,
7266940	7269180	nobody puts Carl in a portal.
7269180	7270460	And I shoot myself.
7274620	7277340	Rock, paper, scissors, Thomas Dolan for the last bullet.
7277900	7278300	Yeah.
7278300	7282700	I was definitely going to say we let Carl die, but he took that away from us.
7282700	7286060	So he was never a good person.
7288300	7288940	Three, two, one.
7288940	7289740	Shoot.
7289740	7290220	Okay.
7290220	7291180	This is a paper.
7291980	7292460	You win.
7293020	7293420	Yep.
7293420	7294620	Oh, I threw paper.
7294620	7295500	He threw rock.
7296380	7302060	And, uh, Frederick Millen the first takes the gun in his hands and holds it up to the
7302060	7305820	skull of Thomas Dolan and is like, you're welcome and fires.
7310140	7316220	The last thing that comes across Thomas Dolan's face is just a look of pure gratitude and
7316220	7316620	relief.
7319020	7320060	He was a good man.
7320060	7331180	And with that, the herd closes in and when they feed upon you, it isn't like, it isn't
7331180	7335740	like they just tear you apart and, and digest you or anything like that.
7335740	7341340	There's, there's a part of you that is now forever within them, just they're still
7341340	7341900	conscious.
7342700	7349900	And you can see, you get this realization that, you know, when
7350140	7354140	hawks broke free, that it wasn't just hawks that came back.
7354140	7359980	It was one of these things as well that had basically assumed the identity of hawks or
7359980	7364060	assumed his memories the way that they're now assuming yours.
7364700	7366540	And, and of course, Edgwick's.
7367420	7368940	And who knows?
7368940	7374460	I mean, maybe, maybe if someone ever repairs the device and fires it up again, you can
7374460	7375980	find a house of your own one day.
7379900	7383340	Oh my God.
7383340	7389420	That was his house would be hungry, but my house would be full of regret.
7392060	7393740	I should have killed myself.
7393740	7395020	Should have killed myself.
7396460	7398460	You threw paper, you dumb idiot.
7398460	7400300	Of course you should have killed yourself.
7406140	7407580	Dude, what the fuck?
7408380	7409420	That was dope.
7410780	7411340	Hell yeah.
7414780	7415900	Oh, thank you.
7415900	7416620	I'm glad you like it.
7416620	7417180	Thank you, Scott.
7417980	7418700	Thank you so much.
7418700	7421100	That was incredible.
7421100	7421900	Holy shit.
7422940	7424540	Jesus Christ.
7424540	7426940	I really thought we were going to get out of there, Scott-free.
7433740	7438540	I don't think I've ever seen an entire party wiped out by a failed push attempt on electrical
7438540	7439580	repair before.
7439580	7450220	That's so good.
7450220	7451340	Oh my God.
7454300	7461260	That was, I can't, I can't, I can't say enough how much fun that was and how, how horrible
7461260	7461740	that was.
7462620	7465740	Good, as I said, I'm really glad you liked it.
7465740	7467900	I had an absolute blast running it for you.
7467900	7469180	It was a blast to play it.
7469900	7470460	Super fun.
7473020	7480380	Now, I mean, I could tell you all my favorite parts, but I am very curious about the behind
7480380	7481980	the scenes on this scenario.
7481980	7488620	I guess I could just fucking read it, but can you give us a rundown of what the fuck
7488620	7489260	was going on?
7489260	7491020	I'm very curious about two things.
7491900	7497420	One, the faceless man, part of it, me thinks that, you know, having a kerchief covering
7497420	7502540	all the mouths might, might be a faceless being, but the puppets.
7502540	7504460	The puppet is what I was wondering about too.
7504460	7505420	Yeah, okay.
7505420	7509740	The puppet was that skinned monkey thing you found floating in the tank.
7509740	7510540	Fucking shit.
7510540	7510860	Okay.
7510860	7513580	I wondered if it might be that, but I didn't know its purpose still.
7513580	7515180	Did they bring it into the camp?
7515180	7516460	Camp with them for some reason?
7516460	7520460	So it's one of these creatures that they pulled out from the other dimension.
7520460	7526940	And what the way it works is when they come into the camp, they wear earplugs of wax and
7527020	7530700	they have this thing that they, one of them just carries on his arm.
7530700	7537500	And when they want to basically knock people out, they just stick a pin in it and make
7537500	7538220	it scream.
7538220	7543740	And it's scream just sort of drives people temporarily into madness and unconsciousness.
7543740	7544380	Nice.
7546060	7547820	Oh, that's so dope.
7547820	7549100	How many of them are there?
7549100	7549820	Them.
7549820	7550620	Capital T.
7550620	7551500	There were four.
7551820	7557900	So I mean, there's a whole other strand if you go into the town and start trying to dig
7557900	7561580	around there and get some information about what might have happened.
7562300	7563660	That basically-
7563660	7564460	Why would we do that?
7566460	7569260	It depends which characters you have, but yes.
7569980	7574540	But yeah, I mean, it doesn't happen very often, but it's definitely an option.
7575180	7580620	There are these four guys, I mean three initially, so it's Sedgwick who started it all off.
7581260	7586620	So when Aston Hawks disappeared, Sedgwick took over possession of the device, the Hawks
7586620	7587100	device.
7587740	7593020	And he realized that some of these creatures they were pulling back, this species 17,
7593020	7597980	would basically siphon, in Call of Cthulhu terms, luck off people.
7597980	7602940	So it would siphon some power and certainly luck and allow you to transfer it from one
7602940	7603740	person to another.
7604540	7611340	So basically, he and a few friends were using this in a predatory manner going into initially
7611340	7615340	targeting people they just didn't like, business rivals or people who were snooping into their
7615340	7616540	affairs and stuff like that.
7617580	7623660	This was why so many people in the camp, their lives had basically collapsed because Sedgwick
7623660	7626940	and his friends had basically been sucking all the luck out of their lives.
7626940	7627440	Damn.
7628160	7634160	They just carried on doing that and, you know, using the luck to play the stock market and
7634160	7637040	make themselves wealthy even during the Great Depression.
7637040	7642880	And so basically, yeah, I mean, every one of the camp is basically their cattle.
7644640	7650240	The previous night, they'd taken these two kids back to, you know, they'd taken Billy
7650240	7656480	and Esther back to the Hawks mansion to try to siphon some luck out of them.
7657520	7661840	And that was the point at which they'd lost containment on the ring, which had already
7661840	7663120	been playing up a bit.
7663120	7667200	And basically, Hawks got out and possessed the house and other things happened.
7667200	7671600	And they ran away and left the kids in prison downstairs and just thought, fuck this for
7671600	7676960	a game of soldiers, ran off and were making plans basically to leave town and abandon
7676960	7678400	all this before it got any worse.
7679040	7679600	That's great.
7681600	7686160	How widespread is the radius of the breach?
7687120	7691120	It had been breaching for a while, which is why some of the things have been creeping
7691120	7693040	out and infesting the house and so on.
7693040	7700720	But the big breach that let Hawks out was just the previous day and it was just big
7700720	7702080	enough to reach the house.
7702080	7704960	What about when we did it?
7704960	7709760	Yeah, I was like, you don't have to tell us if Esther's okay or not.
7709760	7710560	We can leave that.
7712000	7714320	I think, yeah, let's leave that as a question mark.
7714400	7719040	But I don't fancy your odds.
7720400	7726160	Is there in your mind a success scenario once we've been infected by the new species?
7726160	7732480	Yeah, if someone does have the wherewithal to start making modifications to the Hawks
7732480	7738480	device, you can do what Sedgwick suggested and basically use it to sort of phase extraterrestrial
7738480	7740960	matter out of your own body and remove the parasites that way.
7741920	7745360	Yeah, there may be other methods that I haven't thought of.
7745360	7748640	I'm always open to creative solutions, but that's the one that occurred to me.
7749680	7755200	It was just really unfortunate that that result in a failed push-draw.
7755760	7759600	Because otherwise it might have saved you all, but instead, no.
7760800	7761920	That would have been boring.
7761920	7763920	Yeah, it's so much better when it turns out this way.
7765760	7767760	It's a much cleaner finish.
7767760	7776880	I guess technically another way to get rid of the wombs, just get eaten by the house
7776880	7778560	and then you don't have to worry about it.
7779760	7784880	So what was your reasoning on the house?
7785440	7789920	So basically, the way that these parasites have been coming out and infesting people
7789920	7794160	and so on, he basically did the same thing but as this monstrous entity.
7794880	7800800	He'd been fused with one of these giant things that you saw lumbering around and that
7800800	7802000	basically did the same thing.
7802000	7805520	It became a parasitic infection in the house and fused with it.
7805520	7806400	That's so cool.
7807360	7814880	So it could be like any inanimate object could be fused with a person?
7814880	7816240	Or animate ones, yeah.
7816880	7818320	Yeah, shit dude.
7819280	7820080	Oh, okay.
7821040	7828000	So the marsh essentially that was once the garden where Thomas Dolan found that guy,
7828000	7830080	that was from the breach the night before?
7830080	7837280	Yeah, so the guy that you found in the garden was basically a drifter who'd come into the
7837280	7843200	house, was basically looking for something to loot and had been attacked by the parasites
7843200	7843760	in the garden.
7843760	7845840	They basically just drained him.
7845920	7851280	So that was like a some foreshadowing of what was going to happen to you if you didn't
7851280	7852880	manage to get the parasites out?
7852880	7856000	Yeah, and it was well done.
7856000	7861680	And while over the past, I mean, you mentioned earlier, we had three weeks in between knowing
7861680	7866080	that we had parasites under our skin and dealing with today.
7866720	7874320	And I just kept thinking about that guy the whole time and being like, I think we're
7874320	7874820	fucked.
7877280	7881680	Was the the creature in the pond then was also from that first breach, right?
7881680	7882800	Yeah, yeah.
7882800	7887520	Yeah, I mean, I mean, a lot of the smaller things had kind of crawled out there.
7887520	7892880	But yeah, the big breach offered a chance for some larger nasties to get out.
7894000	7899200	If you got to, if you could go on a date with one of our characters, which one?
7899200	7904560	Asking the real questions.
7905440	7906720	I'm a very generous lover.
7906720	7907520	I'll take you all.
7913520	7920640	Oh, man, nothing said after what I'm saying now will be on the episodes because we just
7920640	7924800	finished the recorded episodes of this collaboration.
7925520	7926320	On a high note.
7926320	7935440	If you were going to take our characters to your favorite date spot in New Bradwell or
7935440	7937040	Milton Keynes, where would we go?
7937840	7938720	Oh, gosh.
7939920	7941440	Remember, this is a party of five.
7942000	7942500	Yeah.
7946000	7953280	If you wanted some excitement, we have an indoor skydiving place in Milton Keynes.
7953280	7954320	There we go.
7954320	7954880	Hell yeah.
7955600	7958240	Nothing gets my blood to the edge like...
7959600	7965280	Okay, so bachelor number one, if I was a salad, what kind of dressing would you put on me?
7966560	7968000	That's a bit personal, isn't it?
7974400	7975120	Oh my God.
7975120	7978320	I would say ranch because it's not legal and I'm a bad boy.
7985280	7989200	Scott, thank you so much for running this game.
7989200	7990160	This was so much fun.
7990160	7991680	Oh, my absolute pleasure.
7991680	7992800	Yeah, thank you very much.
7992800	7996400	I don't think it's too forward to say that we're going to miss you.
7996400	7996720	I know.
7996720	8000480	Well, I mean, if you ever want to do something like this again, I'm definitely up for it.
8000480	8004720	Oh, I mean, your words and eyes, we'll see you soon.
8004720	8005840	We'll see you tomorrow morning.
8008080	8010880	But for real, that was fucking awesome.
8011760	8013760	Actually, oh, I'm really glad you enjoyed it.
8013840	8019520	Life surreal in retrospect, a dream.
8020480	8026400	Easy times feel less than serene.
8026400	8033760	In the moment it's hard to count your blessings.
8033760	8053760	So we long for days gone past us, grief and strife, but that's real life.
