402960	408040	All over my body to play this game like I'm Ray Charles. So let's begin
410640	412640	Right now
412640	416200	It's the first week of January in the year of your choosing
417800	420980	2020 wait you choose 2020 I choose
422280	427480	2020 I'm gonna do 78 does that mean as federal agents were fully aware of the looming?
428120	429920	coronavirus threat as
429920	436400	Federal agents you would be but just know that the civilians on the ground have no idea what's coming
436400	440460	So you need to get your like financials in line now that way
441020	444140	You can do better than the people who don't have knowledge
445620	451020	an apocalyptic ice storm struck LaFontaine, Missouri on January 2nd an
451540	458660	Extreme cold front from the Northeast caused a 30 degree drop in ground temperature over a matter of hours
459740	463620	simultaneously humidity reached a hundred percent and a thunderstorm
464380	472180	Blanketed the region the rain already barely above freezing coated everything in layer upon layer of ice
472620	479380	Roofs collapsed under four inch sheets trees exploded as SAP flash froze in the trunks
480060	483380	transformers shorted out and fell flaming from their posts
483780	488720	Cars not crushed by falling debris skidded off impassable roads or froze up
489200	494900	Flights in and out of the area were canceled the governor declared the city a disaster area
495040	499680	But the ice and continuing winter weather prevented dispatch of services
500560	503920	inside LaFontaine a mothballed green box a
504680	512240	Storage facility rented by the conspiracy in the old days sent a silent alarm to Delta Green on the night of the storm
512440	518480	the contents of the box were never inventoried after the organizational restructuring in 2001 and
518840	521860	Friendly caretaker on site is not responding
522560	530520	Delta Green doesn't know what caused the breach or what potential threats might now be in the field and they need eyes on the ground
531400	533140	your eyes
533140	536520	the nearest available operatives the players agents your
537320	542760	Characters each get a call from a known Delta Green case officer the afternoon of January 5th
542760	547160	The call comes in the unusual way in the usual unusual way
547600	550660	From one of the half dozen numbers arranged ahead of time
550660	555880	But which frequently change the caller did his best or her best to sound like they were
556440	562900	Confirming an ordinary dinner or business meeting. They gave a time and place a private
563300	567160	TSA conference room at Lambert Airport, st. Louis, Missouri
568360	576220	1145 p.m. That night it was up to each agent to make personal arrangements and get a last-minute flight
576660	578660	to Lambert now
579620	584740	I'm gonna get an introduction from each one of you and because we're playing a closed game
584740	587940	I'm gonna have everyone else take off their headphones
588740	591240	while we're recording each person's
592220	597040	Introduction because there might be some stuff in the introduction that you don't want the other players to know and that's completely fine as your Delta
597040	604620	Green agents, you won't know each other's identities because we're playing along the the actual rules is written Delta Green strategy
604660	607060	So if you actually do learn information about each other
607060	613920	I will probably have it come back to bite you at the end of the scenario because that's what happens with knowledge you get burnt
614260	615940	okay, so
615940	620060	Let's start. Let's go alphabetical order. So that begins with
621180	628940	Joe already everybody else take your headphones off and we'll do how about I you can also deafen the chat or
629100	632980	Defen the call. Okay, whatever works as long as you're not listening and
633380	634700	And
634700	636660	when you are
636660	642420	Wanted back Justin's not like oh, he's listening to his character voice. He's trying to get in character. I love it
642420	647300	so, uh, whenever we want you back, we'll we'll do the the the
648160	649360	classic
649360	650740	bomb
650740	652300	banana
652300	659660	Making a birds with your hands a bird single bird not multiple birds two birds follow. How will you know which oh
660660	665460	I guess it's just your duty to know out the alphabet, which is cool with me
666420	673380	Yep, duties and alphabets, baby. Everybody stop listening now, and it'll just be me and Joe
680820	682860	Hello Joe hi Zach
683900	685900	What's up, baby? What's cracking?
686560	688560	You ready to do this? I am
690300	695100	I'll just start. Yeah. Yes, please. I'm playing agent Wentworth
697060	700820	Some of you might remember that I've played this character before
702700	708140	You might not have gleaned from that last time though that he is a hitman he's a straight-up hitman
708140	711260	He he goes he jet-sets around killing folks
713100	716460	For the government for whoever because
717020	723380	It's he just responds to his handler miss Turner who he's been with forever for as long as he can remember and
723900	728780	He just drops everything at the at the drop of a hat to do whatever she asks. I
730300	736040	Specifically asked Joe to play this character or at least like persuasively suggested it
736860	740580	Yeah, for sure. You liked it and I was like, I loved it
740580	745680	It was like one of he was one of my favorite characters we've had on the show. Sorry to interrupt carry on
747360	749360	So he got the call from miss Turner and
749940	754280	That said that he needed to report to Lambert Airport in st. Louis by 1145
755300	759220	she went ahead and arranged for the tickets and left me a credit card and
759860	764960	$500 in cash and we also since this is kind of our thing. She has these
765820	767980	custom-made carry-ons that hold
769180	775700	Two pistols for him and she left all that at a dead drop for me and I just went on straight to the airport
775700	777700	but before I left I
778420	783340	Told the landlord of my apartment building that I needed him to look after the cat for me
784300	789700	And he asked why and I said I was gonna go and assess the situation in La Fontaine, Missouri
790780	797980	Because I had deduced that that would be the only reason they would send me to st
797980	799980	Louis, Missouri during one of their
800220	806600	Worst natural disasters ever and I've always felt like a little bit of the truth helps to sell a lie
808580	810580	That seems like a big part of the truth
813380	817660	There's they're sending me there to assess something that's all I said
819900	822740	And let's see what else was there the oh
823140	826860	Yeah, as I was walking out the door, I remember that they're in the middle of an ice storm
826900	833660	So I grabbed a really nice thick black pea coat and a wool stocking cap because I thought things might get chilly
836060	839460	And indeed it's gonna start really fucking cold
840220	846580	Middle of an ice storm. So that makes sense. Shall we bird? Shall we make our bird hands together? Oh
847900	849340	Yes
849340	852060	They're not watching. You can see it and they love it
852820	854820	They all love it so much
855220	860340	Justin's Justin's on it. He's on it. He's got you can all tell what's happening. Well, thankfully Justin
861340	863340	Exactly. All right, I'm out. Bye Joe
869820	871820	And hello Justin
872820	874820	Hey, what's up?
875340	880940	How is it going, man? It's gone pretty damn good here in the Ozarks
885420	887720	You're playing my character is not
888660	893700	Okay, interesting. So I don't know why I was doing that fun time voice, but you know
895060	898580	My character's name is William T Wiggins
899180	902540	he is a coroner in a small town in Illinois, so
903180	905180	someone close to
905260	909860	The East border with st. Louis. I'm gonna assume not too far
910900	912900	He's a short and pale
913580	917540	Lad with black hair like like jet black hair
918500	919620	I
919620	926820	Almost like to imagine like a middle part but like a handsome middle part like it looks better than the the normal one very sleepy
927140	933140	Very sleepy looking thousands middle part. Yeah, like very sleepy with bags under his eyes
934340	939540	Seems to always have his mouth covered by a scarf or a mask or shirt collar, etc
940540	947180	He is always wearing a really nice suit even when he's doing his coroner duties and
947980	951160	black leather gloves when he's not habits when he doesn't have the
951940	957700	The medical gloves on he's very strange, but also quite good at his job
958220	962900	All right, and what did you bring with you here on this this trip to st. Louis?
963060	966880	So I had a handful of things I was gonna bring and let you
967480	973240	Veto some of them if you want to hit me with him also, what's your last name again real quick Wiggins William T
973280	979600	Wiggins, how could I forgot Billy Wiggins? Is that a person did I fuck up and make him a person?
979600	984200	Oh, you're just making fun of his name. He doesn't like when people call him Willie, by the way, so I
984720	989680	Won't let him know that you did that cuz you're an omnipresent God in this world
989960	991220	That's really cool of you
991220	996140	But just know that you're gonna somewhere deep down inside of your character and know that God
998980	1000980	I
1001660	1004380	So I wanted to have like surgical masks and gloves
1005940	1008940	Leather gloves a scarf magnifying glass
1010740	1014820	First aid supplies of some kind I didn't know if those are allowed
1015260	1019660	Do you think a scalpel would technically be allowed on a plane?
1019700	1024820	If you were like, I'm a coroner it's a tool for me or is it too knife like
1026820	1029700	Hmm I bet you're not allowed to
1030540	1034740	Unless it's in your but you you could probably put it in your like checked luggage
1034740	1037980	I don't know. Let's say I did that because I'm a coroner
1037980	1045420	So I figured I'd have some kind of cutting instruments like a lighter and some cigarettes like a little zippo lighter and also
1045420	1047580	A necklace where like if he dies
1048460	1055540	It brings him back to life and also there's a big gun that he can grab from another dimension and
1056220	1059940	It does all it does to deep 30s of damage
1070660	1072660	But I'm glad you let me have the necklace
1072660	1074660	I
1075740	1082460	Does he have a necklace no, he's just for sentimental value do is he a corner with a chain?
1083140	1084800	Like a sick chain
1084800	1090740	Parted parted hair. How old is this? I said 42 early 40s
1091380	1099100	Yep, I mean, I love the idea of him with like a cheap sterling silver chain around his neck just listening to nu metal
1099100	1101100	Hell yeah, that's up to you
1101740	1103740	That's if you want that
1103780	1110500	Also, he's he's a five foot seven. He's a shorter shorter than the average human bear
1110700	1115040	All right, and did you say goodbye to anybody? Did you have to cover? Yes, I did
1117420	1119420	Whenever I got the call
1120040	1124360	William was in the morgue doing his work slicing up bodies and whatnot
1125220	1129040	When he got the call, I'm assuming it was probably in the middle of the night
1129040	1131800	he dropped something into a cadaver and
1133840	1140120	Looked over to his assistant and said well, well Thaddeus I shall be leaving now
1140560	1143760	There's a personal familial emergency. I must see to
1144560	1148620	Please take care of this any points inside of the corpse
1149620	1150960	Mishap
1150960	1152960	I'm sure you shall be rewarded
1153240	1157280	Handsomely also, I don't know why we're cutting into this corpse
1157720	1163280	Clearly he has been shot in the head multiple times and then he walks away from Thaddeus
1164240	1166240	his only friend
1167600	1173640	Thaddeus has seen this happen before or Thaddeus knows I'm just like super weird and I
1174120	1179840	Do kind of whatever I'm very like on a whim. I'll just leave on a whim. I'll just leave
1181480	1186240	And so Thaddeus is used to me being kind of like wishy-washy and just kind of like
1188280	1189920	I'm having a bad day
1189920	1197120	I I must retire and we've been working together for I'm gonna say like at least a year now and so he
1198000	1204520	He's used to me. Just kind of like getting getting weird about stuff and leaving but I'm good at my job. So he's like
1205080	1211600	It's like a TV character when it's like oh, he's a detective who's super weird, but he's so damn good. We can't help it
1212980	1215640	We have to keep hiring him like monk
1217800	1219480	Classic example
1219480	1226160	But yeah, so yeah Thaddeus is the shilube Thaddeus always has Williams back because
1227520	1230720	William is quite nice to him even though he's super weird and and
1231200	1234520	He's kind of like a treats him like kind of like a son in a weird way
1235660	1237400	Okay, fantastic
1237400	1241200	Anything else that we should know before we jump in Oh also
1241840	1246400	Interesting side fact that I came up with before this while I was creating the character
1247400	1252960	He is a I decided he is a in his off time. He likes to do fencing
1255200	1256520	Naturally
1256520	1261160	So you got to put points in melee weapons. He's like weirdly athletic for a a
1261800	1265800	Guy who is a coroner it but it's the only like sport. He likes his fencing
1265800	1269940	He thinks like everything else is stupid and not for smart people because he sucks
1269940	1274580	Yeah, it seems like a super cool dude who I would beat super into hanging out with. Yeah
1277180	1279180	Perfect
1279320	1282400	Or are you trying to make fun of my character no
1282880	1287560	No, no, I would never shall we shall we fly the birds? Shall we fly the bird for Luke?

1545400	1550980	Oh, yeah special agent Jason McNear. Are you that? Yeah, you know what? I spent a lot of time
1551580	1558380	Googling realistic firearms for an FBI agent to have and I didn't I didn't spend any time looking up
1558380	1560900	What is realistic position in the hierarchy might be?
1562580	1568540	Why don't why don't I check that out and I'll get back to you I'm going a little too Irish now
1573300	1580420	Yes, so you're gonna be playing a fee a FEMA oversight personnel like a suit so

1598860	1601960	Codename and okay, I think I'll go with
1602780	1606620	With mr. Smith Oh, mr. Smith. Oh
1607340	1614060	Yep, hey Irish, okay, so mr. Smith needed to make his way to st. Louis by 11 45 p.m
1614060	1619260	That night who did he have to make excuses to on the way there mrs. Smith, you know
1622300	1625380	She's kind of I I am a federal agent she's used to it
1626660	1632140	Irish she's you don't call it out. You know do it incredibly. I'm going okay. Hold on
1632140	1635900	It just has to be just a little bit more upper Midwest. So
1636660	1638660	Then I then my normal voice so
1640420	1643020	So he excused himself to her and
1644100	1647940	Years ago. She thought he was maybe like having an affair
1648780	1654580	On one of these like he would he had to bust out every night at like 10 p.m
1655460	1662580	She ended up following him and she saw him sitting with like she staked out him and his partner staking out
1663020	1664740	Just a boring
1664740	1666260	like
1666660	1674500	Financial crimes like stakeout and she saw him like sadly eating junk food and she knows he hated
1674620	1676620	Like he hated his partner at that time
1677620	1684940	Bummer that like big not like they couldn't work out but like they they solved this. They got the job done man, but like
1686300	1688940	Sitting in a car all night with him was not his cup of tea
1690220	1693020	so she he what she watched him do that a few times and
1693860	1699300	A few times. Well, yeah, she's got it. She's got an investigative personality just like him. Oh
1700180	1702420	Yeah, they're they're detectives in both
1703220	1705220	paranoid
1705220	1710700	Well, I wouldn't go that far, you know, I mean sorry codependent. Yeah, I mean
1711380	1713940	That's what that's what you need, right?
1714580	1715860	someone you
1715860	1717860	Do people who can depend on each other?
1717860	1722380	Yeah, it's a nice thing. Yeah, I don't see what's wrong with that
1725980	1730460	So, what did you bring with you on the trip to St. Louis well
1731620	1734100	Even though he's a very mid-ranged
1735900	1742220	Shootist if you had to quantify, you know, but he has he has taken up skeet shooting recently
1742220	1747420	Oh cool, and he's as an FBI agent. He's already TSA pre-checked and all that shit
1747540	1749940	But he is like he's got his
1750660	1752660	Hold on. I pulled up the regulations
1755140	1762220	He's got his unloaded shotguns and a locked hard-sided container as checked and declared luggage
1763220	1764380	Wow
1764380	1765620	Well done
1765620	1767620	The container is completely secure
1767620	1774860	The firearm cannot be accessed because obviously locked cases that can be easily opened are not permitted. Sure. So he's got two
1775860	1777860	Two skeet shooting
1777940	1780340	Shotguns. Oh, yeah in a hard case
1781140	1788660	Damn, that's intense. And you I assume you have just your regular federal agent service. Yes. He has a nine millimeter Glock
1788980	1790180	Okay
1790180	1792180	Do you know what that means? Yeah, they
1793100	1796240	The trend in law enforcement apparently has been to go
1797380	1799940	Towards a lighter more high-capacity
1801180	1803180	automatic pistols
1803380	1805380	Here's a here's a chilling sentence
1806980	1813820	While some law enforcement agencies have transitioned to larger calibers from the nine millimeter in recent years
1813820	1818700	they do so that the expense of reduced magazine capacity more felt recoil and
1819300	1821060	given adequate
1821060	1826480	Projectile selection no discernible increase in terminal performance
1827980	1829980	No, thank you. That just means
1830940	1835140	Higher caliber weapons are harder to fire because they kick on you
1836060	1842220	So the stopping power that like might make you feel psychologically good with them
1843380	1850580	Isn't really as good as having a pistol you can shoot rapidly and accurately in terms of disabling someone
1851340	1855260	Wow or terminal performance as they sure
1856180	1859780	Turn it Wow, that's fun. So of course, he's got his nine millimeter Glock
1862460	1864460	All right anything else
1864740	1869140	That'll do that'll do just guns. A lot of people brought just guns. Oh
1869980	1873460	Well, yeah, he's got I mean anything he knows what he's meant
1874100	1875860	He's got
1875860	1877860	He's got a parka
1877940	1879940	He's got a good
1880060	1887100	I'll let you explain. Well, all right, I mean having heard my accent, you know, he's prepared for Oh for the cold weather
1887100	1890860	For sure old weather. Are you ready to give him the the birdie? Yes
1901340	1903800	How do we get Luke's attention he's asleep
1904740	1906740	Luke asleep
1907220	1909220	No, I think he's just asleep
1910220	1912220	Oh here he comes
1914180	1917540	I'm really self-conscious that you guys talked for way longer than I did
1919540	1923420	Baby baby was asleep in there. He's back home
1925980	1928580	Stop practicing your character voice. It's horrifying
1930700	1932700	I'm from Illinois
1932700	1934700	Oh
1935780	1938520	Dude did you keep going weird with your accent to I
1939180	1945660	Was trying to do an upper Midwest and I kept going wicked Irish. Oh, yeah. No mine. I already forgot
1945660	1947660	Well, mine was so I'm gonna have to remember
1948020	1950020	When I talk next
1950980	1955180	TSA agents at Lambert, which is the airport in st
1955180	1962660	Louis allow the agents into the conference room inside is a balding man in his early 50s with a heavy pond
1962700	1967340	And deep circles under his eyes. He does not offer his name here
1967340	1971900	But the agents know him as DHS Special Agent Patrick Hill. They have met him before
1972240	1975800	He's a Delta Green case officer and he arranges missions
1975860	1983220	He's the go-between and cutout between the agents on the ground and the rest of Delta Green and the mission is the agents job
1983500	1987220	The agents are his job. Ooh, what a cool thing to say
1988860	1990740	Let's get this out of the way
1990740	1994480	Back before 9-11 people did our group's work out in the cold
1994740	2001700	We got activated reactivated anyway during see during the transition decisions were made. I didn't make those decisions
2001700	2008420	I don't know the people who did but they were made and now we're here. So I don't know more. I can't no more
2008420	2010620	We're all only here because we were
2011260	2018380	Closest or available and I'm not going with you because I've been up for two days trying to find you a ride into the goddamn
2018620	2020940	Missionary got it. Okay, so around sometime
2022100	2029260	2002 some team or another was tasked with repurposing assets from the old group into the new program
2029260	2034860	you guys know with all them the government switch over there and at least one of the ones we knew about and to my
2034980	2040120	Understanding it was it's like a cost risk analysis based on the needs of the moment and the current budget
2040120	2042120	you know how this shit goes so
2042120	2047980	They tended to report that moving things out of unsecure private storage to secure
2048360	2051480	Official locations just wasn't worth it in the end
2051480	2054960	I don't know if it was because the contents were too volatile or
2055240	2059000	Someone couldn't be bothered to find a truck or they didn't trust the transition. I don't know
2059000	2061200	Okay, I mean it's the you know who these people are
2061200	2065380	I wasn't there but one of those storage sites that they used was in La Fontaine
2065900	2068860	Yeah, that La Fontaine the one from the news
2069300	2073660	I'm sure you guys if I am well aware right right the ice storm
2073660	2079500	Yeah ice storm so they installed an alarm on the door right of the security place and they got some friendly
2079820	2081820	from the utility company one
2082420	2084420	He looks down at his papers
2084620	2086220	skip Mills
2086220	2093220	To keep an eye on the place gave him some bullshit about maintaining a secret counterterrorism storage site or something
2093980	2099140	Do it for God in country the typical patriotic make your life special bullshit
2099140	2103940	I don't know. He was just strictly observing report didn't even have a key as far as I can tell
2103940	2106340	But the idea was to come back to the Fox
2107460	2111060	Got I got to find the Fox first, but then he's gonna come back to the box
2111060	2114740	I suppose in a few months when when things that eventually settled down
2116420	2117580	Well
2117580	2119580	It's been a few months a
2120220	2125140	Few because I was talking about 2002 right now and it's 2020
2127820	2132660	Yeah, so here we go see that's 18 18 years a month
2135300	2138620	He just stares at you which is more than a month of Sundays
2138620	2140620	The
2142860	2150540	Storage unit is at knurls rent a space unit zero one seven one. Yeah, I know upset clusterfuck, but
2151620	2154300	Obsec clusterfuck you're preaching to the choir
2155260	2162100	Obsec operational security clusterfuck for those of you who you know might do math out loud to people. They just met
2162780	2164460	You're preaching to the choir
2164460	2168500	Anyway, the site is designated GB to to for you know, like
2169180	2176660	Yeah fucking green box to 24 ice storm hits the city hard on the night of the second and the parrot box that
2176700	2182600	Security system sent a silent alarm to someplace way above my pay grade right and it reports a breach
2182940	2188260	Shit is so far buried in the shuffle the nobody and signals pucks up on the damn thing until two days later
2188500	2192080	That's when they dragged my ass out of bed. So we have nothing on the ground
2192120	2196480	I don't know if this Mills was on the silent alarms call list or not
2196480	2201700	All I know is that I can't get a hold of him, but then I can't get a hold of anyone
2202160	2207680	Phone lines are down across the entire city. Most of the cell towers are dead
2208060	2211360	Something like 70% of buildings are without power still
2211960	2215560	Yeah, all the cell towers are dead. So I guess they're gonna miss out on
2216680	2217880	anyway
2217880	2218920	We're
2218920	2226360	Blind down there. All we know is that the door to GB to to for has been opened for going on a week
2226360	2232720	And we don't know what was inside. We don't know if this Mills guys on the level. We just don't know
2233240	2236280	And you have to find out who tried to say something
2237120	2239120	I'm sorry. I said, oh dear
2241160	2245280	Like oh god, I got you a ride on a National Guard disaster relief convoy
2246080	2251160	It leaves in a few minutes you're on an oversight group working for FEMA
2252160	2258200	Don't abuse the cover. You're just suits. Okay, just watching you're making sure everything's going
2258200	2261520	All right, and this legend is paper thin
2261520	2267200	I can't for the life of me think of why anyone would put you all in the same room together. I mean
2268080	2271040	Fucking lucky you is the best I can do on short notice
2271760	2278000	Paperwork is on the table. I got you some office space squared away at the city utilities company
2278000	2283320	Which is where that skip Mills guy was fuck knows. I spent enough time on the radio trying to find their boss
2284120	2289160	From there find out where this Mills guy is and what he knows
2289720	2294740	Head out to GB to 24 and inventory the content see if you can tell if anything's missing
2295020	2301000	Okay, right because if you go there it's a green box the stuff in there
2301820	2305500	Should be kept away from people and if it's missing
2306620	2309680	Then other people are seeing it
2310340	2312540	Nod your heads. Can I get nods?
2313220	2319060	Good job, everyone. Fuck me. Okay. Now if something's out there
2319740	2324260	You got to do it needs to be done text me if you need anything, but keep those messages
2324860	2328420	Clean-and-coated I'll do what I can from here, but
2329300	2336140	There's a hundred miles of solid fucking ice around you in every direction and more alphabet soup
2336220	2341140	Agencies and media in the theater than you can shake a dick at so don't expect miracles
2341740	2342900	hell
2342900	2344900	Don't expect anything
2344940	2346940	You're on your own
2347060	2348940	So do you guys?
2348940	2353300	Understand what your mission is. This isn't sorry. I wasn't the tired guy anymore
2353500	2355500	Right
2356620	2361620	Yeah, the container is open we have to go find the friendly
2362860	2366900	figure out why the container is open whether or not anything dangerous escaped and
2367980	2375180	Neutralize whatever that might be and we have to talk to skip Mills and see what they are. That's the friendly
2375180	2377180	That's the friendly
2377260	2383460	They're friendly or are they can I can I ask this guy a question or is he out of the room?
2384980	2387180	Mr. Out of sleep, mr. Hill
2388140	2394060	You have fucking used my what the shit dude you introduced yourself as mr. Hill
2394180	2399380	No, I told you as the out of body narrator that you knew who I was
2399380	2401380	Oh
2404300	2408260	Sir yeah Wentworth. Do you have a last known?
2408820	2412700	Residence address for this skip Mills. I understand
2412700	2418620	He was the attendant at the storage units, but you surely knew where he lived. He looks through these papers
2419660	2421660	And he's like shit. I mean
2423180	2425460	Boy yeah, where are we at here? Oh
2426460	2429740	God and he looks through some more papers and then he finds
2430660	2434620	The apartment or it's a house. Yeah, I found the house. There's an address
2435700	2440260	Excellent. Oh that will make things much easier. I don't know I
2443540	2450380	Look at the other people in the room and I stand up from my chair. Are we prepared go ahead and describe what you look like
2451380	2453140	He is
2453140	2460780	He's well-dressed. He's very nondescript. In fact, he's so nondescript. It would almost be striking except how nondescript he is
2461380	2462940	He's wearing a black pea coat
2462940	2470740	You can tell that there's maybe a suit underneath and he's wearing a wool stocking cap and leather gloves and you reach down and grab your
2472140	2478360	Identification as FEMA oversight and you can introduce yourself with whatever name is on it, which is
2480700	2482180	Barry
2482180	2488060	Fredrickson, is that how you would choose to introduce yourself to the rest? I mean, I don't think he would say anything

2671900	2673900	Surgical mask over his
2674460	2679800	His mouth. So sometimes it's a little hard to hear him and he's very he's a little quiet and reserved
2680220	2687340	But he's very well dressed and seems put together. It looks very tired. And that's that's that's me. That's me, baby
2687620	2692740	Cool. I didn't describe what my guy was wearing, but it's just like a it's a big old parka
2693260	2697420	Tight he's he's he's wintered up, but it's also it's like clearly
2697740	2699060	a
2699060	2706620	Ten to fifteen year old like out of fashion ski equipment. Perfect. The colors are wrong for
2707220	2709220	2020 I
2711620	2717940	Went skiing for the first time in a very long time like since I was a child a couple spring breaks ago
2717940	2721100	And because my uncle is money
2721100	2727700	My uncle has money and unlike everyone else in the old family and he was like come up to Breckenridge
2727700	2730780	I'll pay for everything and I was like, yes, please and when I got there
2730780	2734100	I was like you have like equipment for me to use and he's like hell yeah
2734100	2737620	And he starts cracking up and then he pulls out this full
2738780	2745840	Baby blue like bright baby blue and bright orange like to head to toe back and forth like
2746720	2750240	Badass like bright snow suit and it was so cool
2750240	2755680	And every single person as I was like walking everywhere was like, holy shit that guy
2755680	2762700	Oh my god, that's right. And then they saw me get off it like the green one like the easiest slopes and I'm like
2764000	2770920	Flailing on the way down and everyone's like, oh look at that ass hat who spent a thousand dollars on his gear and can't ski for
2770920	2772360	Shit, right?
2773040	2778580	I actually lost a ski and had to like ask people to help me try to find my
2782360	2786260	If it makes you feel any better nobody was really judging you you were just that high
2788360	2795280	Like altitude though, right like my god, yeah altitude and an illegal state just like, Missouri
2795280	2797280	Did
2798040	2803460	You guys okay speaking of crazy rich people things did you guys see that reddit post yesterday about the
2804680	2807280	the razor crazy carts
2808160	2809320	No
2809320	2813560	No, there are these little electric guys going around the plaza. Yeah. Mm-hmm
2813640	2820140	Yeah, they're like they're like seven hundred dollars each to get one that can support an adult. I can do that
2820140	2822140	I just got twelve hundred dollars for no reason
2823100	2825100	Do you guys want to spend your stimulus
2828220	2831820	Little electric carts that we can they're made for like drifting
2833460	2840100	You mean we can Tokyo drift finally, yeah, we could just Tokyo drift around the empty streets of Springfield
2841220	2843220	new patreon goal
2844100	2848740	By us crazy. We'll take a cool video. We'll play Mario Kart against each other
2849700	2851700	so I'm gonna go pee and
2852180	2855760	We will jump into La Fontaine, Missouri
2856100	2862800	Okay, you guys are gonna be riding in the back of a Navistar defense 7,000 MV troop transport
2862860	2868860	Which is gonna be very cold. It's one of those like trucks military trucks with the covered wagon shit on the back and
2870140	2872820	So you're gonna be in there packed with
2873380	2879020	soldiers like National Guard like National Guard people members as well as like
2879780	2883860	Blankets and food and clothing and shit just all packed in there
2883860	2888020	so if you guys want to like do a quick think about how you might want to have a
2888460	2894380	Conversation during this time so that we can get to know your characters and so that your characters can get to know each other
2894580	2898340	Then that might be a good way to jump into the scenario
2898860	2906560	So I'm gonna leave. All right, bye wait for me, please we promise we won't play without you
2906560	2912360	When he gets back, let's just tell him we're done we think we figured it out the DMS gone
2912360	2918700	So we solved the it's an open game now, but it was a bunch of angry raccoons that slid into the storage thing
2923080	2925520	But one of us did die and up in the battle
2928160	2931820	I'm gonna pee too, I guess yeah, I was gonna say I should take advantage of this
2931820	2935800	I'm just gonna sit here and stare into space earlier when they left me alone
2935840	2938440	I sang a song so you're up. Okay
2939480	2942320	Sorry, Zach. I'm gonna readjust myself
2943960	2949720	I'm gonna do some stretches if you've been sitting at your computer for a long time. You should do some stretches too
2949720	2951520	We could do them together
2951520	2953520	Hell, I'm gonna stand up
2959160	2965520	Is this dream terrible I did a stretch and people said that they were stretching too. I am a health guru
2965960	2969240	Did you do a stretch that changed because every time I moved my arms
2969240	2975320	I saw my pit stains were getting they got out to the point to where my entire sleeve was covered at the bottom and
2975680	2981920	It was so wet. I couldn't take it. I should unbutton my pants, but I think YouTube will ban us if I do that. Oh
2983080	2988800	I don't think so. They can hear the unbuttoned and they're like shut it down. I have my cool Kanye pants on
2989660	2995040	They're very comfy with the with the pocket. Yeah, I'll show the people nice
2996000	2999600	Hoodie-pocket hoodie-pocket. What are you doing you? Oh
3000880	3006440	It's like a it's like a baby kangaroo or a tiny loop once I clone myself
3007160	3009160	That's where he'll live
3012360	3016120	And he'll live in my afro so I can cook good French food to
3018120	3021480	Raduluki got it. Nice
3021880	3023880	Ha
3024040	3026040	I'm drinking one of these
3026680	3027880	Dude
3027880	3029880	Truly pretty good. That's
3029960	3032600	That's exactly what's in here. Nice the mango
3032600	3036680	I got the orange and I added a little stevia to it just to give it a little more sweetness
3036680	3040200	Oh shake it up. These things are too sweet for me. I
3041160	3045200	Really? Sorry not to be that not to be that guy. Oh you add sweetener to it
3047160	3051000	My drinks dries a biscuit that was poorly made
3052360	3057880	Does that mean with whipped or with frothy coffee? Well, yeah, dude frothy milk, I mean
3058920	3060920	Just a little barista
3062760	3067360	Somebody ordered a cappuccino dry for me when like when I first started at the coffee shop and I was like
3069080	3071080	They went all the juice in it
3071920	3073920	That's dirty
3075200	3077400	Best bartender in Springfield right here, baby
3077400	3079400	Let's
3080040	3082040	Dive back in
3083080	3087440	The briefing said LaFontaine was ill-prepared for winter weather
3087600	3094120	The city had sold most of its salt trucks and plows to keep from declaring bankruptcy during the reception
3094120	3099900	But nothing the reception heard you for this the reception they threw a massive reception
3099900	3101900	And
3102520	3106220	They could they had they had they sacrificed a bunch of kids
3106220	3109340	But like the ice storm still came and it was a sick party
3109380	3115380	So no regrets ease and honestly fuck those salt trucks and plows that party was dope
3115700	3120180	Yep, nothing prepared you for this level of destruction
3121020	3127980	Nearly every road is blocked with felled trees phone and power lines dangle everywhere the few
3128340	3136480	Emergency responders you see are still chiseling vehicles out of the ice like sculptures and most who succeed seem to have
3136940	3138940	impotently skidded off the road
3139240	3146640	The majority of homes remain damaged and without power their residents are left to freeze in winter temperatures
3147020	3154700	Getting to the few operational shelters requires trekking on foot across the eerily beautiful city of ice
3155620	3156660	Upon arrival
3156660	3161820	They're crammed into crowded shelters filled with cots and hastily packed
3162180	3167680	Suitcases and even the lucky ones with vehicles rugged enough to escape often have to find a path ahead
3168100	3171380	through the felled trees and the roar of chainsaws is
3172140	3180020	Constant even after five days relief teams have made scant headway a few major roadways are cleared and salted
3180380	3185180	The commercial and university districts to the south have power restored
3185700	3189340	Honestly, that doesn't sound like scant headway to me. It sounds like they got the the major
3190820	3198700	Commercial and university districts restored very little relief though has come to the north side the poor side of town the convoy
3198860	3200860	inches through
3202460	3208960	The north of LaFontaine is the oldest part of the city cut off from the rest by a moat of abandoned warehouses
3209800	3210760	Railyards
3210760	3218620	Factories and other remnants of the city's industrial past the massive old growth trees dotting its residential
3218760	3222480	Neighborhoods caused more damage here than anywhere else
3223340	3230100	The only lifeline south the Zora Neale Hurston bridge remains a clogged icy mess
3230200	3234080	It will be difficult to tell who needs help in northern LaFontaine
3234280	3241420	Only the locals can distinguish which homes were abandoned to the storm and which were left vacant by the real estate crash
3241940	3243080	still
3243080	3245080	Progress is being made
3245440	3251840	Operating out of the headquarters for city utilities workers are slowly getting LaFontaine livable again
3251960	3259440	It appears that while the storm will certainly be expensive. None of the relief workers will be haunted by any lost lives
3259880	3266760	So that's good everybody who's like seemingly got trapped in their houses and shit made their way to a shelter
3267160	3268560	It's uncomfortable
3268560	3275760	But patrols and emergency shelters are so far keeping those without power fed and warm
3275760	3277880	And as you guys are rolling through
3278780	3282360	the camera kind of like zooms up to the back of this
3282680	3289920	Transport and then through we see soldiers in the very back and then like kind of a muffled wall and all throughout the middle aisle
3290440	3297040	Just like clothes and food and blankets and supplies and then in the next part
3297360	3302120	The four of you sit two on one side two on the other facing each other
3303200	3309840	So hey there fella. I don't think you told us your name. I say to to Joe it's character
3309880	3314780	It's Barry Frederickson, that's a good one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you picked a good one for sure. I
3315720	3317940	They just get they gave me
3318920	3326720	Terrence fast fast night. I think fast night. That's a that's kind of a cool name. It's practically fast bender
3326720	3334280	You know, it's it's not as cool as my real. Oh, yeah. I mean it is my real name right now, but it's
3335280	3337280	and
3337540	3344500	Terrence looks down and stops immediately talking. So we're alone in this compartment. Yeah, let's go ahead and say that way there
3344500	3345800	We don't have like
3345800	3347800	prying ears
3347840	3349600	Immediate
3349600	3354400	Opsec breaches exactly like I just to like get an introduction to you guys are
3354800	3358600	You look over and you see two young National Guard recruits
3359240	3361240	eyes wide
3363040	3365040	You just have time to draw your firearms
3365040	3367040	So
3368960	3373280	Yeah, mr. Mr. Fast Knight there so you're saying in real life you have a
3375280	3381160	Cooler name than your code name. Yeah, we're not I don't think we're supposed to say though
3382040	3383960	As far as I know
3383960	3391120	I'm I'm still new to all this. I I I don't know. I know I'm needed and so I came well
3391120	3392520	I just want to say, you know, I'm sorry
3392520	3397140	Cuz this there's a lot of it this job can be stressful in a lot of different ways
3397140	3400840	and I think not being able to go by a pretty cool name is
3401480	3408120	It's up there one that people it's just one people don't typically think about so I just want to say like I'm glad someone
3408840	3415800	Understands my great duress. I am under and I'm sorry about that. My guy is looking the kind of puzzle between you two. I
3416800	3421220	Am unaware of how the coolness of a name factors in to our mission
3424000	3426000	You know, that's a fair point
3426440	3428540	we should be playing this by the book and
3429640	3437280	But anyway, yeah, you got a friend in me buddy. Why thank you and Terrence Fast Knight slips his little
3437880	3443940	Like surgical mask up over his thing because he's uncomfortable being in a crowded dirty truck
3444300	3450820	Well, I don't think we came here to make friends do you guys have any ideas for what we get there well
3450820	3452820	Yeah, we just find
3454200	3456200	We find skip Mills and
3457640	3462700	We figure out what the heck is going on down at that green box were you all
3463420	3466260	Able to read the briefing. Oh, yeah
3467020	3469740	There is a chance this skip Mills
3470260	3473140	Sought shelter, perhaps we can get records of
3473660	3480040	Intake at these shelters didn't Patrick Hill who we all knew beforehand, but I forget what he told us. His name was
3480940	3485140	Didn't he didn't he give us his his address where he's known to be now
3485420	3489840	he did but as the briefing said most homes have been left abandoned and
3490420	3493940	Shelters are at capacity. Oh, that was his okay
3493940	3498660	I thought he just told us directly where he was that would have been a lot handier. He certainly did
3498660	3505180	I'm suggesting that he might not be home. I suppose we could look at a map of some kind and
3505940	3511340	if there's a shelter near his home that he'd probably go to the nearest one or
3512140	3514540	The closest one to these storage
3515380	3519060	I'll call around as some shelters and I get my phone out and Google
3520100	3524220	LaFontaine, I believe that your cell reception will be not so good here
3524220	3526220	Based
3528100	3529260	Off
3529260	3535000	What they said that all the towers were all jacked and such we're heading to city utilities
3535380	3541880	Which I don't think I made this clear. They're up and running their skills. It's where skit Mills worked
3543260	3548780	Okay, so you're being dropped off at CU City Utilities, which is where skit Mills worked
3548780	3551480	I thought he works at a story, you know, he's yeah
3551980	3558720	And it was the attendant thing just a side job of his he was a friendly. He didn't work at the storage place
3559180	3565100	Okay, so he was just told he's just the guy when they were packing the green box that he was like
3566140	3569340	Right next door at his own storage unit and they're like
3578780	3580780	Yeah
3580900	3582900	Yeah
3582900	3587440	Like five innocent witnesses today because they play like us and they were just
3588780	3592300	Like damn it skip. We just can't have any more blood on our hands
3594540	3600960	So you guys are dropped off in front of the city utilities building before the truck joins the rest of the vehicles in the motor
3600960	3603060	Pool parking lot around back
3603060	3604660	so basically the
3604660	3612200	HQ of this whole operation is gonna be in the parking lot behind city utilities in a big motor pool where everybody's got
3612460	3614140	generators
3614140	3621260	cars are all back there and these trailers are popped up back there and as you guys go into the city utilities building you see
3621260	3629100	It is clogged with activity complaining customers entering their second week without electricity pack the lobby like cattle
3629620	3632660	Overworked receptionists do their best to calm the crowd
3633340	3640780	Exhausted linemen trudge in and out returning for more equipment or just trying to catch a few minutes sleep in the locker room
3640780	3646780	and as you guys walk in you see a woman who is short squat has
3647220	3652900	big glasses and she's wearing a car heart pulled all the way down and
3653820	3658700	She comes up and she's like, hey, hello. Hello. Are you the FEMA oversight group?
3658820	3660500	Hey there
3660500	3666500	Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. This is me. I'm Tanya Cambria
3666500	3670620	It's nice to meet each one of you. Thank you so much and she goes to shake your hands
3674060	3676540	My guy does yeah, I should yeah and
3677180	3681420	Enthusiastically I shake her Terrence holds his hand out like
3682180	3684180	Like he's waiting for someone to kiss it
3684180	3686180	Very
3687660	3690020	Very gingerly, hey, okay cool
3690020	3693440	And she like puts her elbow out and kind of like hits your hand a little bit
3693440	3698420	He like kind of if you want to do one of those that's fine. He gives a little slap with his fingy tips. Ah
3699420	3704460	All right. It's a pleasure to meet you Mark. Mark Smith gets like a
3705260	3709920	Little physically uncomfortable and anxious scene that like breach of normal
3711360	3713100	social decorum
3713100	3715820	It's like, oh, you know, it takes all types
3715820	3720880	But where I come from, you know, you shake a hand if someone's trying to shake your hand. Yeah
3720880	3726280	No, well, I'm much more on your side of the equation here, but that's where we're at these days and no
3726280	3729200	I didn't fully didn't say it out loud. That's just what happened in my gut
3729300	3732660	Well, I just heard it and so I responded role-playing
3737100	3739380	I found it. I found what came out of the unit
3744100	3750340	Miss Cambria, what is it? You do here? Oh, I'm just a I'm just trying to put all this keep it all together
3750860	3752300	Let's see
3752300	3758140	You know, I knew there's gonna be a response team about but Oh office manager
3758140	3759420	You can call me whatever you want
3759420	3762860	But basically if you're talking to just me and you I run the place
3763260	3768260	Obviously these people they don't know what they're doing and I got some office space for you, right?
3768660	3773540	Look at that's what I told you take did you were you told that I had office space for you because look at me
3773540	3777240	Of course, I've got office space for you. Come on down. Okay
3777920	3782420	My voice is this now and yes, you're starting to
3783420	3789940	I'll do what I want and you were just starting to sound like some kind of Star Wars merchant like
3789940	3798600	I've got office space Roy. You went British and then I went you said office space
3801460	3806320	All right, so yeah, no I was going for a more of a Mike Wazowski so
3807420	3809420	Yeah, if you come out through here
3809760	3815060	God, yeah, the temporary office that I've set up for you is a prefab trailer. It's in the parking lot
3815060	3822380	Okay, and she walks you through the back of the building and like moving through come on down move out of my way as she's
3822380	3824380	passing through this sea of
3825340	3827340	tired and stressed out
3829140	3835840	Civilians and so you guys make your way through the back Mills hasn't been here in a couple days few days now
3835840	3840980	And so you can just use his office. This is what he was using before miss Cambria
3840980	3848100	You know, we can't thank you enough we all as FEMA agents were responding to Springfield back in all seven. So
3848780	3853360	So we know what it's like to go through this kind of major
3855660	3862100	Meteorological event there. Well, it's good to have people like you. Yeah. Thank you very much miss Cambria. Yeah, we all know that
3863420	3865140	snow
3865140	3867140	when too much is
3867660	3872160	Is bad you always talk like this. Oh, I'm very sad now
3873140	3877380	Sorry cut out in the middle of what you're saying like nothing came out of your mouth
3877820	3883000	So I didn't hear you sound like a crazy person if you could repeat yourself, maybe I'll react more accordingly
3883000	3889700	Yeah, I thought I might have just been me there. But it totally cut out. It wasn't even like a drop of discord. Oh, I
3890420	3892420	Talk slowly also
3893880	3895220	Snow
3895220	3897420	When when too much is
3898380	3899860	bad
3899860	3904800	Yes, I get it. All right, so and you pop out through the back door and you said
3905540	3911120	Hit me with it before we leave miss Mills. Okay, it's Cambria miss Cambria miss Cambria
3912660	3918060	Yeah, we need to speak with mr. Mills, do you know where we might find him I wish oh my gosh
3918060	3923520	If you could tell me where he is, that would make me a happy lady. But here I am. Look at my face
3924520	3926520	Am I happy lady to you
3927280	3933760	It looks like you're doing the best you can under the circumstances. Oh, that's real sweet of you to say
3933760	3934880	I'm really glad that you
3934880	3940280	Professionals are here to really keep an eye on things and she like points around as you guys are about to open the door
3940280	3946960	And she's like brace yourselves cuz it's a fuck ton of idiots and cold weather out there and she busts open the door
3947240	3951560	And you see that the parking lot has been cleared of its thick coat of ice and large
3951640	3959200	Command tents and the diesel generators heating them take up the space nearest the building and otherwise the cold keeps the parking lot
3959320	3966160	Mostly empty save when trucks drive in to be resupplied or repaired in and out as they go
3966160	3972160	but as you guys move past those tents, you see there is a trailer that is a
3972880	3974400	makeshift office
3974400	3981000	It's the relief effort HQ and it's where you guys have been sent because you are the suits in charge
3981120	3983320	How's that feel? It's just a disaster
3985000	3989400	It feels bad, well, you know, I don't think anybody will
3990720	3996020	particularly think it's out of the ordinary if the federal government just really
3996440	3999800	drops the ball on disaster response for a couple days, so
4000320	4004400	It should I think it's more decent cover than we're being given credit for
4004920	4006080	You
4006080	4011560	know, I I think that that guy Mills, you know, he had that exact kind of
4012360	4016400	Feeling inside his entire body when he was here. I'm sorry. I thought you left
4016400	4020760	We I wasn't gonna say anything like that for you. You said you yeah
4020760	4026440	Oh, I pushed open the door and I I told I told Luke that I was gonna walk all the way with you guys
4026440	4027520	That way, you know
4027520	4033260	If you if you were worried because I wanted to say one more thing about skip Mills and then have you guys roll humid
4034520	4038320	Oh, oh, yeah, that makes it that's standard investigatory a procedure
4040120	4042120	So actually you don't have to roll
4042560	4045680	We're gonna play this scenario as written
4045680	4051360	so there will be a few times where so in Delta green if you just have a skill at a certain number you
4051800	4056600	Pass so if you're not under stress and there's no like time limit on the thing
4056600	4064320	Then you don't have to roll for it, which I except we never do that. No, no, we don't we don't play that way
4064400	4069040	We play a different way. And so here we are. So if any of you have humans at
4070000	4072000	30% say aye aye
4072880	4074320	or
4074320	4076320	At 30% or above that
4077440	4079440	Yeah, like way above
4079680	4086500	I forgot. I'm still this lady. I'm still this lady. I gotta wear my beanie. I like it. He's my head warm
4087080	4090560	It's uh, I'm at a 60 miss Cambria
4090560	4097520	Oh, well, then you of course would know that as I'm talking about skip Mills and I'm saying stuff like wow
4098360	4103400	Government workers. Am I right? Some of them love some of them hate some of them come to work
4103400	4109040	Some of them don't this guy dips out in the middle of a national emergency
4109040	4113720	Maybe not national national for us. I mean my life is my country, you know, and so
4114260	4117100	You would know that like she's pretty uncomfortable
4118100	4121180	She's like very comfortable talking shit about him
4121260	4127260	but you can tell that she was very very confused and then she says but I
4127620	4131900	Will say when he did come in three days ago the last time he was here
4131900	4139100	His face was covered in scratches and sweat and it was awful. He looked fucking terrible
4139100	4144020	I am sorry for the cursing but this is an emergency and it's like theater in high school
4144020	4150380	You could just cuss whenever you want. It's fine. Everybody loves it. You know, it's liberating. You're all looking at me right now
4150380	4155380	I'm not gonna say anything about attraction of people or anything like that, but
4156140	4158780	I'm someone who doesn't get the male gaze
4159380	4164420	You know from from from people in his age group too often
4164420	4167780	But boy howdy the last time he came in here it was
4168620	4170140	not
4170140	4176660	Comfortable. Oh, I mean he was he was yeah. What is your age difference there? Well, I'm 85
4181180	4185780	She's like how old is mr. Mills she's probably like mid 50s
4188220	4191820	You just lied you just lied to federal agents there
4193980	4197540	Well, you never ask a woman her age or a man it's rude
4197660	4202220	You can't ask people how old they are unless it's their birthday and even then you just count the candles
4202780	4210260	Ma'am in an emergency any bit of information might be relevant. We need you to please be forthcoming with us and even I'm actually
4210620	4212620	69 yeah
4212780	4214780	Sorry
4215340	4220220	No, it's fine you can laugh that's exactly the kind of like dirty humor
4220220	4224180	It was that kind of dirty humor that looked like it was in this this guy's eyes
4224180	4229460	I mean what he sees in his 30s early 30s people like that don't you know often?
4229460	4235660	I've had a professional relationship with Skip Mills for years and not once has he ever looked at me like I was a piece of
4235660	4237660	Meat that he wanted to fuck
4237820	4243020	Sure, we get it. He was really giving you the eyes there the last time you saw him. Yeah, did I make that clear?
4243140	4248020	Yeah, speaking of which just before you dive in any further to this conversation. That's definitely over
4248620	4253760	No, no, I have I have a question for her. Okay, hit the question then we'll move what was what was mr
4253760	4255760	Mills duties here
4259920	4266860	Ma'am try not to laugh. I need to know what his responsibilities were his duties
4269920	4271920	Well, I'm looking them up obviously
4273680	4277340	Sure figure it out. I'm pretty sure that he was running the
4278000	4281320	He was he was he was in charge. That's why you guys are here
4281360	4289320	We needed FEMA oversight because our city utility supervisor during a power outage with ice all over the city is
4290360	4291800	Nowhere to be found
4291800	4293800	three days nowhere to be found
4295520	4298320	You know, it sounds like he was one horny dog and
4298880	4304120	Those might have been those might have been love scratches, you know on his own face
4304760	4307760	Yeah, cuz the your lover scratches. Yeah
4311560	4313560	When your lover scratches
4314520	4320480	Across the face. Has anyone tried contacting him? Of course. What did you say? Have you been to his house?
4321480	4327360	We've been no we're not gonna go to his house. Why would we yeah, of course like we're gonna go to his house
4327360	4331320	Do you know how much money and time it takes to get anywhere in this fucking city right now?
4331640	4334440	Yeah, I mean like we said we were in Springfield
4334440	4336240	So, you know it could take some time
4336240	4340880	But money is a weird way to qualify how it would take to get down to a fellas house
4341320	4346320	It's not like I am the office manager. I look at the bottom line
4347400	4349400	Financials, that's what I'm all about
4349800	4354400	Sure. Sure man hours. We get it. We get it. Okay. Bye lady. Thank you
4355040	4358720	Did we get a definitive on skips age 30s early 30s?
4359720	4364920	You have a job to do. I have a job to do. Let's all do our jobs and she turns around
4365520	4368000	She bails. Well, I say we go to his house
4368000	4373480	I think probably what he saw in her is that she was such a strong, you know minded personality
4373480	4378400	She's really, you know, I respect the hell out of that lady. She was quite strong and
4379400	4381400	attractive to
4381800	4383800	To some of us I think
4383800	4389440	She really didn't make much of an impression on me, but to each their own well, you know some men have a natural
4390000	4396640	Predisposition against not natural. It's been ingrained by society against powerful women and it's really toxic
4396640	4398640	You gotta get over it. You just need to learn to
4399280	4406120	Admire and respect somebody like that instead of feeling threatened. Okay, that's great advice. So you guys
4406640	4407880	were
4407880	4412800	You guys are so cold while you're having this conversation and you're all just looking at this door of this
4413440	4415440	prefabricated trailer that is
4415920	4420560	right in front of you before we jump into this and Joe will hop to you first, but
4421240	4423240	due to the
4423440	4424680	content of
4424680	4427920	Delta green and role-playing games in general
4427920	4435120	I know that we have an understanding of each other and that we are close friends and we have been playing together for a long
4435120	4438640	Time and I've yet to have something happen in a game
4438840	4445160	Where one of you came up to me afterwards and we're like, I felt uncomfortable during that and I wish you wouldn't have done it
4445920	4447920	However, that's the goal. No
4449440	4451440	Hold on to your butts
4451480	4454620	So basically I want to implement a safe word
4455160	4459260	For this game and honestly just moving forward in all of our games
4459260	4466960	So if anyone is made uncomfortable at any time by the what is happening either whether it's me doing it or someone else
4466960	4474560	Doing it in a scene just say the word and we'll immediately fast forward like cut to the next scene and then afterward off-mic
4474560	4478440	We'll talk about it and how we can do better and make sure that that wouldn't happen again
4478600	4483400	Is that cool with everybody or doesn't even have any suggestions about how to do that better works for me
4483400	4488940	I think it's our safe word. What is the safe word is the question?
4490020	4492020	Kraft mac and cheese. I
4493160	4497440	Ran out of mac and cheese a few days ago, and it's really nice and innocent. I like that a lot
4497440	4502200	Let's go Kraft mac and cheese. All right, so if anyone says Kraft mac and cheese out of context
4502960	4504480	Then we know
4504480	4511520	To bail and move on I think that's too bad. This one takes place at the haunted craft factory
4516840	4518840	Yeah, the people voted for
4519360	4521360	named mac and cheese
4523920	4525920	Boy
4526560	4531360	Boy, all right. So as you guys are diving into
4532160	4537080	The utilities manager's office. Oh, he's the manager. Of course. He is it says right here
4538200	4541720	He's the manager of city utilities. Just like the main dude
4541720	4543320	This is what the one you're looking for
4543320	4549980	So Tanya drops off the group in front of Mills office and returns to her work and the prefabricated trailer
4550560	4552640	suffices as a base from which
4554040	4556040	sorties sorties sorties
4556640	4561800	Sorties means small parties that are sent out to for missions and such to go and yeah
4561800	4568260	Oh know that I didn't either if you played enough strategic RPGs like me and Thomas did you would be?
4571200	4579160	Fucking idiot if your family had exposed you to as much military history as a child like any proper American family should be then
4580040	4583060	You'd be well acquainted with what a sortie is sir
4583060	4586800	Fair that's why I when we're besieged
4588460	4594120	What was that when we're besieged I'm gonna be in charge of things none of not you fellas
4594260	4600100	Maybe Justin is you're my colonel. Yay, finally, I would have died in the initial blast
4602500	4604860	Yeah, we probably would have positioned you somewhere
4605620	4607620	Hey
4608700	4615020	Before we start I do have to go use the restroom before before we dive in deep before we go into the office
4615460	4617460	Yeah, that's fine
4619140	4626140	I'm never mad at you. I want to get to the meat of this thing. Well the miles I mean the Mills meet
4626900	4629600	Give me that Mills mate. Oh boy
4634860	4636340	Oh
4636340	4639120	Hey guys, yeah, when you go into the office
4639860	4643420	It's heated and as soon as you walk in you're like, oh
4644860	4652860	Hell yeah, because I wait Zach comes before we get any further we should clap again. Did you start recording again? Mm-hmm
4652860	4658020	Oh, that's good. We've been I've been recording the whole time. I just forgot to sync us up when I restarted it
4658020	4662520	Oh, we can do another class. So you have you've recorded two files now. Is that what you're saying?
4662560	4667880	I immediately started recording again. Oh, okay. That's fine. And I anyway I shouted real loud right there
4667880	4672280	So it should be easy to find in the file, but I'm gonna be off sync for the last
4672800	4679000	Very this is gonna be super confusing that it sounds good. All right, let's do the clap
4679640	4681640	one two three
4682600	4684600	Six seven
4685880	4687680	Nice
4687680	4693060	It's wild how behind it all is for me. Yeah. Yeah, it looked really really bad
4695720	4697580	Thankfully that's streaming baby, sir
4697580	4703620	I think it's literally physically impossible for us to clap on track together through streaming technologies
4703840	4709780	We could spend a while trying so you guys go into this office. It's warm. It's nice
4710580	4716780	You are stoked to be there there's a few fold-out tables a desk and a computer and
4718060	4721060	The only other thing that you notice is it kind of smells
4722020	4724020	What is that?
4724220	4728380	Like Bradford pears weird, that's like real bad, right?
4729100	4732560	It smells like come does smell like come. Yeah
4733660	4737700	Wow, it might not be trees even it kind of just smells like come in here
4740780	4742780	Oh, damn it
4744500	4747620	Is okay, I want to I want to search for come
4749860	4755280	Does it does it actually smell like come do we need to look yes, um, it absolutely smells like come in here
4755620	4759540	And as you kind of like, I mean you said it so as you're walking around
4759540	4765080	you can't kind of focus in on a centralized place and it's the desk and if you're like
4765640	4769160	Really moving your nose around the chair
4769680	4775280	Behind the desk has a little bit stained on the front of it. And then if you bend over
4776320	4780040	the underneath of the desk like if you're just like
4780640	4782440	smelling around
4782440	4784440	That's good audio
4784440	4787560	You're just getting a nose full of this guy's jaw sauce
4788960	4794200	Just like she's all up down here and you would notice that like the ground
4795080	4801060	Where his feet were is like the carpet is stiff and hardened and there is residue
4801460	4807520	Stained under the desk like the up and up underneath it. So he's shooting up there
4809600	4812720	Wants to check out his computer one, two, three. I'm sorry
4817040	4819160	So I was like I was reading this
4819640	4825520	Scenario again after I put it in the poll and people started voting for it and I was like, oh fuck a
4829240	4833820	Cum horror show like the first clear is like there's fucking cum everywhere
4839320	4842680	I think I think Terrence would willfully
4843320	4845320	like raise his hand because
4845840	4847120	He's like I
4847120	4851680	deal with quite awful things every day so I
4852360	4854560	Can do this and what do you do?
4855240	4856720	Checking the computer. Yeah
4856720	4863360	Let's see what he was making all this fuss about you move the mouse around and the computer's already logged on
4863800	4867080	Still logged in just just for the record while this is happening
4867080	4871600	I want my guy to be walking around the office like if there's file cabinets
4871600	4876960	He's going through some of those just okay just doing what you would do to search a room for signs of this person's life
4876960	4881400	Yeah, smoochy. What are you doing? Same? Yep, and Smith. What are you up to? I'm
4882720	4888600	Observing them all and taking diligent notes in my in my FBI issued notebook
4888640	4893400	That absolutely makes sense and I'm like, hey there make sure you don't disturb any of that cum
4896120	4897840	Fast night as
4897880	4902600	You're going through the computer you notice that there is a program that monitors the power grid
4903080	4908120	In the town the power grid monitor program, but it needs a separate password
4908840	4914160	But as you're going through the computer you find Mills's home address like immediately
4914720	4919280	On some correspondence or sorry, that's actually Joe you guys already had his home address
4919280	4924560	but you confirm it here in the office and then the web history is really
4925560	4927560	It's really horrifying
4928560	4931360	Fast night as you're as you're scrolling through
4932480	4938560	The the porn the porn the sheer amount of porn on this computer
4939200	4945080	that has been that it was accessed three days ago all between like the hours of
4946080	4950320	630 a.m. And 1 p.m. On January 3rd
4950320	4954840	It's like it's pornography in the sense of like past past
4956440	4958440	Films of people
4958640	4964800	Fucking each other this is getting it gets weirder and weirder and weirder and darker
4964800	4971520	And then more violent and more violent and then like he is trying to find the most punishing
4972720	4975920	Regardless of gender regardless of anything
4976480	4980680	Anything it's all about how violent the videos can get and
4982080	4989160	As you're just like looking through the names of these videos you have to roll sanity. Oh
4991840	4997720	These videos so fucked up just reading the titles of them makes you roll sanity for how gross I
5000480	5004800	Pass 52 on a 70 you lose zero sanity as
5005920	5010440	You have a 70 sanity. You're the sanest dude ever. Hell yeah, bro
5011920	5013920	Yeah, I've also got one of those
5015520	5021680	One of those seventies so due to your line of work as a female oversight agent
5021680	5026120	I would assume that you you're you're like pretty strong
5028200	5034760	Mentally for this kind of stuff. Yes, my past life has prepared me quite well for horrors and
5035720	5037720	Nasty shit happening to bodies
5039080	5043600	You feel me bro, he says out loud as he's searching the computer
5049040	5052080	Imagine having to touch that mouse and keyboard Wentworth and
5053440	5057480	Smoochie who has searched and who has SIG it or criminology
5057480	5061640	I've got a search of 40 and I've got a criminology of 30
5062120	5064120	60 search and
5064360	5069740	What was the other two criminology only 10? Can I pitch in on either of these? Yeah, what do you got?
5070260	5072260	70 search and 50 criminology
5072640	5077140	Okay, you guys know with all of that star-studded skill points
5077140	5083000	You guys see as you're looking about you see that on the backside of a desk calendar
5084720	5090400	Ecclesiastes 28 is written on it in ink pen on the back of a calendar and
5091120	5093240	Then go ahead and roll
5094560	5097280	SIGINT or criminology, I believe that is
5098520	5104360	I have a search notice again, but who had criminology. I have a 50 criminology
5104360	5110320	That is what I was asking for. Please roll criminology. I fail 82 on a 50. What was it?
5110720	5116440	Ecclesiastes what 28 28 and then Justin as fast night continues
5117160	5121760	He gets the gist of the history of what's going on on this computer and
5123560	5129400	Who's got computer science who's got the best computer I have 20 I have none
5130240	5132240	I got none Thomas
5132840	5139040	Hold on. Sorry. I've got the I've got Ecclesiastes 28 pulled up over my character sheet and I
5139560	5141560	Have none, okay
5141960	5145500	Okay, so 20% go ahead and roll that computer science there fast night
5146440	5148440	Oh
5148960	5150960	Crit fail 77
5154200	5156200	Explodes and kills me
5157200	5158800	Okay, so
5158800	5167080	You slip you slip and come and delete the file. So as you're going through here, you're trying to figure out what is
5167960	5173920	Going on and you see this power grid monitor program that's still up and you decide you're gonna try to get into it
5173920	5178960	Right. And so as these boys are looking around the room, you're just like typing typing
5178960	5184480	You're like, oh, I bet his password is his address and then he typed it in and then you're like, oh
5184480	5186480	I bet his address is
5187320	5191800	Mills and then you type it in and then you're like maybe skip Mills and then capital S
5191800	5195720	skip Mills and you do it until it's like you've been locked out of the system and
5195960	5200900	At that moment you turn around and they're like, hey, I found Ecclesiastes 28 written on the back
5204040	5211440	Mark Smith starts reciting it from memory. Oh, no, and he's kind of he kind of looks a little confused when no one else joins in
5214880	5220400	Yeah, Ecclesiastes 28 woe to the crown of pride to the drunkards of
5221400	5224640	Forgive me pastor's son, but uh, f Ryan
5225160	5227160	Is that right? I'm
5227160	5230000	If I really go for the pronunciation, it's a frame
5230000	5232000	Okay
5232880	5236160	Yeah, well whose glorious beauty is a fading flower
5236800	5240840	Which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are who overcome with wine
5242360	5245760	Fat valleys, I guess that might be like a fupa there or something
5247600	5252440	Behold the Lord hath a mighty and a strong hold on fellas
5252440	5255700	Don't laugh cuz you're about to laugh more because verse 2 starts
5256380	5259740	Behold the Lord hath a mighty and a strong one
5260620	5262100	which is
5262100	5264860	Which is what I said to my wife when I woke up this morning
5267220	5273460	It's like oh look at that sometimes when you really got a pee it's like I didn't even know it could get that big but
5275580	5281300	Which as a as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm as a flood of mighty waters
5281500	5284580	Overflowing shall cast down to the earth with that with the hand
5285420	5292740	The crown of pride that drunkards of f Ryan shall be trodden under feet and the glorious beauty
5292940	5298940	Which is on the head of the fat valleys shall be a fading flower and as the hasty fruit before the summer
5299660	5304420	Which we need that looketh upon it seeeth while it is. I'm going way Irish
5306820	5309560	Why I think I'm getting to the end of the point
5311380	5313380	Have you not looked this clue up before
5315060	5320940	Anyway, basically if they don't it doesn't take too kindly to these drunkards of f Ryan interesting
5321540	5326360	Whose glorious beauty is a fading flower was that 20 Ecclesiastes 28?
5326700	5334440	Yes, and I'm of course quoting from the new King James version you asking that in character because he just resigned out loud
5335020	5338620	No, I was asking out of character cuz when I do it, I don't think I pulled up the same thing
5338620	5340980	I don't see f from listed anywhere in here
5340980	5342980	Oh
5344380	5348340	Boy if I pulled a Bible boner and quoted the wrong verse
5350580	5355860	I love how much this like hardcore religious guy talks about his dick
5359980	5363900	No, what are you talking about a dick when you talk about pulling a boner?
5367620	5369620	Okay, yeah
5371340	5376440	Bacon well, well, we'll make note of that and you can recite it later if it comes up
5376740	5382620	But I think that might just be the password for his computer. Have you tried that yet Terence?
5383180	5384660	ashamedly looks
5384660	5391540	Like it looks over. I I did I did too many. I did too many of the bad ones and
5392220	5394220	Now we are all locked
5395220	5397220	out of
5397340	5399740	the computer the come pewter
5401660	5404040	Did you guys like my awesome joke, I mean
5405340	5412100	Did you find anything in the computer before it locked you out? I I saw disturbing pornography
5413060	5416860	that would shake a normal person to their core, but
5417540	5419960	one such as I is not phased by
5421100	5423100	humanity's depravity
5423100	5425100	Okay
5429740	5433580	What a cool sentence to say to new friends I
5435900	5437900	Lean over to to
5438220	5444140	Frederickson Barry Frederickson, I'm like not exactly a fella you'd want to have over for you know
5444140	5450860	Meet a dinner of meat and potatoes, you know with with maybe like the Hendrickson's or maybe just your kids
5451420	5456220	That man's proclivities do not concern me do I hear all this urchin do I hear this
5457260	5459260	We're in a tiny office
5460040	5464140	Yeah, I mean it was implied that he was leaning over and saying that to me under his breath
5464140	5467620	But if you want it, okay, I roll to hear it roll to hear it. Oh
5469380	5475640	Boy good thing I have the lowest alertness possible. It's good for Delta Green. Oh, yeah
5476240	5478240	Seeing what's coming
5479120	5481120	So does Terrence
5483320	5486040	We haven't seen what was coming only what came
5488340	5491320	So, what's the plan I think we ought to head to this guy's house
5491960	5498240	So was the the confirmation of his home address the only other thing that I found in my young. Yeah. Okay
5498720	5500760	Can I do a search role on the place as well?
5501120	5507400	You can not would it would it be fruitless? Yep, you're good. Oh
5508040	5511320	Yeah, actually go ahead and roll roll search for me real fast
5512380	5514380	Fuck 83 on a 70
5515080	5517320	Perfect. I didn't have anything. I
5520320	5522320	Admire the gambit I
5523240	5527560	Like that you're like, you know what I'm gonna challenge myself to have something exactly
5528320	5531160	You found a cool candy bar and a can of coffee
5532160	5534160	You're feeling fucking good ad
5534680	5536680	15 sanities
5539280	5541560	Random free candy bar gives you 15
5544320	5548880	Someone comes up and says something not mean to you gain a sanity point Oh
5550680	5553960	Poor Terrence, I feel like in this office
5553960	5560040	There would be a paper map of the city for his records and I want to use it to try and locate
5560200	5566520	His house in comparison to where we are how far away it is. Oh something also I meant to ask earlier is
5567040	5574080	This does the city utilities. Do they have internet up and running here city utilities does have the internet live right now
5574080	5577720	All right, so we could what we could do even though we don't have
5578400	5585800	Access to the internet on our phones like when we go out and about we can download a local map of the area on
5585920	5587600	Google Maps and
5587600	5590920	Then we just have that. Oh, I think that's really smart
5590920	5595040	we can also do some scout and find out how to get from here to there and
5596560	5602100	Smoochy you were talking earlier at there about finding out where the shelters are you could get to Google in that while we have
5603000	5605200	All we have that Wi-Fi I will do that
5605760	5613160	So essentially what you've got is you've got the shelters are on the south side of town and then along the other
5613480	5617340	so the main shelter that's being used is
5619300	5620920	Written
5620920	5626220	Written down on my sheet. It says Truman Memorial High School
5627200	5634560	In the south down there is being used. Is there a phone number listed for it? Of course, why wouldn't there be?
5635200	5637000	Alright, give it a call
5637000	5644900	Okay, roll a 50% luck straight up and down on whether or not the phone line works this time around. I got a one
5648080	5650440	Crystal-clear. Yeah
5652480	5654480	Reception
5655400	5660520	Truman Memorial High School Becky speaking. Hey Becky
5660520	5662520	Um
5663200	5669840	You guys are using the school as a shelter at the moment, correct? That is correct. Um, do you happen to
5670700	5675780	Have a list of the people staying there like a check-in sheet of any kind, you know
5675780	5680400	We tried to start one but at the end of the day it got real out of hand
5680400	5684680	I'd say we got about half the people's names down right now, but we're working on it
5684680	5688240	Could you check and see if there's a name on there? I'm looking for somebody
5689080	5694940	Gosh because you rolled a critical success, I guess I got the sheet right in front of me
5696680	5704680	Yeah, I'm looking for mr. Mills Mills Mills Mills, I'm a speed reader nope, okay
5704680	5706680	I
5713320	5719580	Guess I'll ring you up if I need anything else. Who is this? I'm in charge
5727240	5728760	Security
5728760	5732520	We're civilians, I'm FEMA I'm with FEMA. Oh
5733240	5740200	Okay, you should lead with that next time is what I'm gonna say because if you called back here with just a normal success
5740200	5742200	I'm asking who you are first
5742520	5747240	Yeah, well save this number as FEMA. So everybody knows
5749640	5752760	Did you call from your what did you call from
5752760	5754600	I
5754600	5756600	Could I have there was a phone in the office?
5756600	5759360	Skip Mills office, but could I have call?
5759360	5764060	I'm gonna give you I'm gonna tell you that it would be smarter if you would have called from the office
5764560	5770120	Okay. Yeah, I I didn't have reception. So I use the cum covered telephone to call. I
5771480	5774680	Want to be clear the cum was in one location
5776920	5781440	You just did that he wasn't trying to Peter Parker's way through the office, okay
5781960	5783960	So I use
5791040	5797920	So you find out that Skip Mills is not at the shelter well he I tell them
5798600	5801900	well, they didn't have his name on the list there, but she also said that uh,
5802640	5804760	Not everybody's name is listed. So
5805440	5810200	I think that we should try his house first and and go there as a
5811000	5813000	Bug backup plan
5813040	5820680	Jay Hawkins is saying and I agree that the classic spider-man noise is the whip not goose
5831640	5835660	Spider Wang spider Wang goose, whatever a spider King
5835660	5845060	On the phone, no, we didn't just under the desk look out here comes Skippy Mills
5847580	5853900	Good good one Garth. I like was he looking on the top of his desk for a dice that he dropped
5855180	5857180	You never know
5859580	5861580	They do end up in strange places
5861780	5867660	That's true, I can't actually fault it there's a chance that thing ricocheted about 12 times and landed back there
5868940	5870940	Behind the scenes everybody
5871540	5878400	Well, okay, so it does bear noting that when we got the idea for letting you watch
5880220	5884900	These recording sessions we didn't know they would very quickly become
5886240	5888800	remote technological nightmares, yeah
5889800	5892640	We thought it would be a fun time with us all in the room
5894440	5899240	So, thank you for bearing with us and joining and I hope your quarantines going good
5899320	5904440	Yeah bear down on finals guys fat dog. Yeah, it's fat dog this
5908920	5911000	Very insensitive of you Zach
5913840	5916560	God I his face when he's like
5919400	5922600	That's where I got it from sorry we're talking about community
5923240	5929160	Okay, I was like, I don't remember this coming up. Yeah, it's it's a community episode. All right
5929160	5932000	I'm gonna go pee and then let's crack back into this
5933160	5935040	Are you serious?
5935040	5937040	No, so, okay
5939040	5940520	Joe
5940520	5946360	Yo, Barry Fredrickson gonna look over for your name Fredrickson looking at the map while
5947120	5949560	Smoochie is on the phone you notice that
5950880	5954200	Skip Mills lives a few miles away from here in
5955080	5958200	the north side of LaFontaine
5958960	5964640	Earl's rent a space is on the way there. It's in between the two locations cool
5964640	5969760	It's tempting is it might be to hit that up. We should maybe check it on the way back. Oh
5971640	5973640	Shit I'm not a southern character
5973640	5979440	It's immediately default role-playing voice, oh it's hard. Oh
5981720	5984640	Don't you know so yeah, that's what I sound like
5985120	5990960	And always have so don't let nobody tell you any otherwise and if I go leprechaun
5990960	5994120	It's not because I'm actually secretly a leprechaun. So
5995160	5997160	Can we roll to check on that?
5997160	5999160	a
6000240	6002240	Leprechaun
6003720	6004800	Love it
6004800	6011560	So, you know, they told us that the first thing we need to do is to find Stephen Mills. Skip Mills. Skip. Yeah
6011560	6013560	skip I just I
6015000	6021240	Definitely, I'm not this is you just know I'm not saying this is the group because we're not supposed to give out personal information
6021960	6023760	but
6023760	6028400	Definitely one of his kids is named skip and after seeing this come covered office. He's like
6029000	6032060	He's like no, no skip would do this
6033400	6035400	This is a Stephen for sure
6037880	6045160	Okay, okay so I I agree I think we should go find skip and then on the way back we can hit that storage box
6045160	6047000	and if he
6047000	6052320	Turns out to be some help. I think we'll need all the help we can get with that thing. Probably I agree
6052320	6058880	Yeah, yeah real quick before we go. Well, you know what? Maybe we should just get the drop on them at the shelter
6058880	6062600	I was gonna say maybe we should have that call that lady that Becky back and
6063200	6066640	And say hey, could you just start looking around for old skip there?
6066680	6069680	But maybe we don't want to alert him that we're on to him
6069920	6073240	Perhaps you could have her call us if she discovers him there
6073320	6076040	That's what I was getting at, but I don't want her tipping him off
6076160	6080960	But if she does come across the information, you know without probing, yeah, I don't I don't know
6081520	6083600	You know what to expect from skip but uh
6084280	6088240	My conversation with that lady. I don't know if I could convince her to
6088920	6094560	To even try to go look for him. Oh, wow. I didn't say it was it was she real rude dinner
6095360	6102200	No, I mean, I guess I could call back if you guys think but uh, it kind of just seems like we're
6102200	6104200	Not
6106040	6113360	Going anywhere, yeah, let's just go. Yeah, I'm just gonna say it you could go somewhere. Oh, yeah. Yeah, let's go to skips house
6114240	6116240	Any idea how to get there?
6117440	6124360	Yeah, we've got them and like how are we gonna get there walking right? I think we should probably oh that's you're simple
6124480	6128600	We got it. It's too cold and slippery out there. We got to take a vehicle
6128600	6134520	I'm sorry, but I'm from the north and they're just you know, it it riles me up here and these folks say such
6134840	6136880	How far is the house from where we are?
6140280	6144400	Can we can we get a vehicle from the city utilities to use
6145000	6150400	Exactly. They've got all kinds of they've got all kinds of vehicles for doing just this sort of sort of work
6150440	6156560	Yeah, does anyone have bureaucracy? I do what's it because I'm so good at talking to people. I have 50
6157280	6163720	Holy shit, so I let's does anyone else have a higher bureaucracy than that? No. Okay, so
6165920	6169240	Do you want to play this out Justin? Oh, you know it transport
6170680	6175760	Can I go talk to Tanya my one true love? Oh, oh she oh there she is
6176320	6177480	Sorry
6177480	6182520	Sorry, I had to turn it about that way. You see the logo, you know Carhartt
6182520	6186560	It's uh, it's not a little it's a lifestyle brand now and it also keeps you warm
6186680	6191280	Is Tanya just hanging out outside or something outside of the trailer or do we need to work our way back?
6191280	6195680	Yeah, no, you can't leave that there. If you leave that there, then we'll have to come get it later
6195880	6200880	What do you think? No, you can't just do that. Oh, if everyone did every what you're doing every single day
6201920	6209680	Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt what seemed to be extremely good leadership skills, but yeah
6209680	6211680	well, that's all I have I I
6211920	6214920	We need to borrow one of your big trucks
6215560	6217960	Not the small ones but a big
6218800	6220800	snow truck of some kind to
6221400	6228720	Go find skip. Do you think we could swing that? He slips her a $1 bill as he's saying
6234840	6237400	And I wink and I go I know how this works
6238160	6243480	She dies laughing she thinks this is the funniest thing she's ever seen she's like
6248840	6253640	People people in the government have no sense of humor these days. That's fucking hilarious
6255480	6262400	Joking only she rifles through this big keychain that she has and she finds one that's got a
6262400	6268240	Honestly, I'm out of my element here and it's not in the scenario
6268240	6271920	What kind of vehicle would they be using to to drive around town?
6271920	6277760	Do you think this is a big old like a monster truck a pickup truck with the weird stuff in the back a month?
6277760	6280600	Yeah, it's a monster truck. I changed my mind town monster truck
6280600	6286260	It's used for it's used for parades and stuff for the city utility. It's called this. It's called the snow angel
6288600	6291560	It is like a disco ball that's always rotating on the back
6292400	6297240	yeah, no, it's a pickup truck with a disco ball hanging from the mirror up front and
6298320	6300320	monster truck no and
6300760	6307360	Not even one of those pickup truck monster trucks. Ooh, yeah, like where it's like a little it's like a regular-sized pickup truck
6307360	6311360	But it has big old monster truck wheels. Oh, yeah, we can do that. That's yeah
6312240	6314800	You got big ass and truck nurse
6316940	6319300	Okay disco balls I
6320300	6324180	And it's got a big old sick-ass machine gun on the back
6326500	6332580	It's got there's no balls on the back that are branded city utility. Oh hell yeah, we'll take it
6332580	6337820	We'll take it on our way out. I want to go over in the corner of the office
6337820	6341220	We're in and in my backpack. I pull out what looks like a
6341760	6348700	Smoke detector and I stick it on the ceiling and turn it on. Oh sick. What'd you just put in there?
6348700	6350980	Yeah, what was you fill in your fellow?
6351620	6356480	Investigators and on what you just put what I did there. Yeah, it's uh, it's got a camera in it
6357220	6359340	See if anybody comes back here
6360060	6361340	You know
6361340	6363440	Just in case very cool
6367020	6371740	You don't you know, I think that's pretty cool too don't start any fires cuz it doesn't work like that
6371780	6374540	It's just do you have more of these?
6375420	6380660	I've just brought the one don't don't you know that now would be a good time to talk about what we all brought to this
6380660	6387340	Year party. I think that's a great idea after you guys see me stick that on there you say that and I just put my
6387340	6390120	I have like a hiker size backpack
6391040	6394180	Put it on the ground and start pulling stuff out of it to show you guys
6394300	6399640	I've got a bunch of hand and feet warmers just in case cool. I've got two
6400340	6402780	GPS trackers like tiny GPS trackers
6403620	6407040	I've got that smoke detector that I already stuck on the ceiling
6407220	6412420	I've got a pair of night-vision goggles a pair of handcuffs a pair of binoculars and
6413220	6418020	A grapple hook with 15 feet of rope tied to it. That's cool Joe
6418300	6424880	He looks at you guys and he pulls a little notebook out of his pocket out of the inside coat of his pocket
6424880	6427620	I simply brought the only tool that I need
6428180	6433760	Typically we find new tools in the field. Wait, what is it a pocket knife? No pocket notebook
6433900	6439260	Okay, I admire that kind of old-fashioned Terrence Terrence thinks that that's really fucking cool
6439780	6445020	Instinct. Yeah, I got a don't you know, I think that's pretty fucking cool tool Terrence opens up
6445020	6451340	He has like a leather. What do you call like us? What is it when it's like a little like a weird hard leather suit?
6451780	6456340	Yes. Yeah, he like pops it open and he has a
6457020	6462540	scalpel and some other little metal instruments some gloves and surgical masks a
6463700	6470300	magnifying glass some first-aid supplies a cool book and a lighter and some cigarettes and
6470460	6474260	I think did I say gloves and scarf? I can't remember if I said that I zoned out. I
6475420	6479420	Just brought the essentials and some a couple extras
6479980	6484840	What about what about you? Well, here's what here's what I got and marks myth
6486340	6490300	He has just like a carry-on like wheeling little suitcase thing
6490780	6498320	and he's got some some warm sweaters some warm socks a book about like the history of the FBI like a
6498680	6501860	Book about like an historical event in the 30s or something cool
6502100	6508260	But then he also sets down like his his checked luggage and it's this big long hard case and you see two
6508580	6513020	Like target shotguns in it. It's like, you know, I'm I'm
6513660	6516100	When you know when I'm not shooting
6517060	6522380	Unknown horrors for for the big DG there. I I took up shooting skeet
6523340	6529100	And it's pretty it's I've traveled all over with these before so is no problem checking them on the plane there
6529480	6533340	So if anybody else needs if anybody thinks they're handy with a shotgun there
6533340	6539260	Oh, I'd say I'm slightly above average with a firearm. I'm almost exactly average. Yeah, I
6539980	6544820	Know my way around a shotgun, but I don't believe I'll be needing one right now
6545580	6551740	You know, it's here. They're too big and if I shoot it on middle to shoot me backwards like a cartoon
6552460	6553740	character
6553740	6557260	That is a yeah, that is an issue with these sometimes there
6557260	6562580	So I'd say just go ahead and bring those with us in the truck and hopefully we don't have to use them anyway
6562580	6564580	Yeah, so I got those in socks
6565500	6568780	Can I have you guys do the headphones off for just real quick and I'll do a quick wave
6570100	6572100	my
6572980	6576700	Guy was very purposefully not telling them about the two guns that he has
6576700	6582020	He discarded the carry-on and put him into holsters on underneath his coat and very specifically
6582280	6587020	Only pulled out that notebook from inside his coat. He didn't open this coat. Fantastic. Yeah
6590700	6592700	You're back so
6593180	6598500	You guys are going to skip Mills's first. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so you load up the truck
6599260	6603740	And you head a few miles to the home of skip Mills in
6604300	6608640	LaFontaine and as you're driving through it's the same site that you saw earlier through the back of
6609260	6611260	that truck the
6611300	6615020	City was just completely destroyed
6615020	6621300	I mean I we live in the Midwest and we have the internet so we know what that looks like
6622100	6628300	Well, dude, do we Zach some of us some of us some of us lives through it Zach
6628420	6632420	And some of us apparently we're at Zach. Yeah yours truly
6633060	6636380	Didn't I moved here one year after I moved here in Oh eight?
6636460	6641260	Perfect the great ice storm of ott7 struck struck Springfield drunk
6642500	6644980	Springfield it struck it down for two full weeks
6645700	6653060	Covered an ass it was stuck at my friend's house and we couldn't play Guitar Hero because there was no electricity. That's horrible
6653060	6655260	I bet that's the worst thing that happened
6656260	6658260	It was actually really fun
6662620	6665180	Yeah, you guys loving this quarantine, all right, so
6667020	6672100	You guys get out to this house in a dilapidated a dilapidated a dilapidated
6672860	6675660	neighborhood a few miles from city utilities
6676260	6684300	Nearly all the residences on this block are foreclosed and those that aren't are busy recovering from the storm
6685180	6688100	The windows of this house have been papered as
6688820	6692380	You park even you can hear jazz music
6693100	6694620	loudly blaring
6694620	6700860	From inside and as you all get out, I want you to tell me what you're bringing with you as you smell
6702020	6708440	Who an odd stench that it seems really familiar since you've been in that office for a while
6708700	6711360	But even through this like frigid air
6712000	6719560	It's just Bradford Tree City out here is like you're walking through the campus of Missouri State University in fall
6720440	6722440	famous canals like
6722460	6723680	jism
6723680	6727520	Yes, I I leave my backpack in the truck
6727520	6733140	But I bring with me one GPS tracker and then I put a new
6733480	6739820	Set of foot warmers in my shoes and hand warmers and my gloves nice continue on staying warm, baby
6740140	6747180	Terrence would have his suitcase with him at all times. It's not like a super humongous suitcase because I'm not carrying anything like
6748080	6753220	Enormous in there. It's a tiny suitcase. Yeah, like a mid-sized not like those huge
6753220	6758420	I don't know. I'm just thinking of how people have those like enormous ones. I just have my my nine millimeter
6759120	6763060	Under my under my parka as we step out of the monster truck
6763460	6769540	I've got my gun and a pair and a pair of socks. Okay, I throw an extra pair of socks into my
6770140	6773780	Into my back pocket when you hop out. I look back at the truck
6773780	6776700	I'm like, do I know that you have that gun on you or not?
6776700	6781660	Yeah, don't know all of us except for Joe have our service. I don't have a gun on me
6781660	6786140	I don't have a gun either. I've thought when he sent the circle thing that said no guns
6786140	6791780	That means I couldn't have a gun that is what yeah for sure unless you were with the force
6792060	6795580	But he but he's with the force is what it sounds like he described
6796700	6798740	Did you describe out of character the?
6799380	6803700	Yeah, I think you said FBI mustache at one point nevermind. We don't necessarily know that you're
6807260	6814220	No, well first of all, what do you guys how are you involved with all this if you're not I've never met anybody who wasn't
6815420	6820220	Like me on one of these missions, but first of all, what do I mean by like me?
6820220	6824980	I don't mean anything by like me because you don't know I'm no I'm no federal agent
6824980	6828900	I'm a I'm a second Second Amendment enthusiast and
6829660	6835140	I'd rather not get into my personal details and to be honest. I really don't care about yours
6835580	6839100	How is he come on like that guy's gotta be a cop listen to him?
6840460	6841860	anyway
6841860	6847100	Mind if I bring one of your shotguns? Well, I kind of I kind of was leaving them behind cuz it was inconspicuous
6847100	6854400	We also you know, hey, I thought you all would be strapped as it were Mark Smith would know that looking around
6855740	6861020	This neighborhood is desolate. Honestly the idea of being inconspicuous in a place like this
6861980	6865940	seems strange because when you look around it is
6866620	6874560	Ghost town. I mean frozen iced over but still like there is nothing and the only the only reason that it feels
6876020	6882660	Normal in any way is the music coming from this house, but that combined with the smell and also
6883340	6888180	What you have come to expect from Delta Green leads you to believe that
6889220	6891220	You know, it's probably just house full of
6891980	6894360	Come that's gonna come alive. Oh, yeah
6896380	6897580	So
6897580	6898420	cube
6898420	6902940	Mark Smith looks around and he like sees he just hears the wind howling
6903380	6908460	Behind the jazz and like a dog barking in the distance, but he doesn't see any other activity
6908980	6912620	And he thinks about what he's seen on these on these missions before
6913620	6914780	You know
6914780	6920360	Dad might not be a bad idea there and I hand him I hand him one shotgun and I take the other
6920900	6925460	when you hear those dogs barking will you roll for me an
6926580	6930780	intelligence or a science biology or a
6930780	6932780	Now
6932980	6940620	That everybody now just Thomas when you say certain things it unlocks me to ask you for a role sometimes
6941820	6947140	39 on a 75 intelligence when you're listening to those dogs barking
6948060	6950900	You could have sworn that you heard one. That's like
6953180	6955660	Like howls out in pain and then you hear a
6955700	6957700	Oh
6960380	6965900	That doesn't sound like a dog did any of you fellas hear that hear that dog maybe just get
6966900	6971220	It by an owl there. I heard something. I don't know I didn't
6972020	6976420	I might have just heard barking but I wasn't paying no attention. I was looking at this shark
6978340	6980340	It's always yeah, it's always good
6980980	6988660	To be be aware of the firearms in your possession at all times because it's really cold outside the moment
6988660	6993340	You're not that's when accidents start happening. But what are we waiting around for? Let's go. Come on
6993340	6995540	We got a cum monster to catch real fast
6995540	6999060	I assume that the this is a neighborhood that doesn't have power is that the case and
6999460	7002500	If that is the case, do we see lights from the house that we're approaching?
7002740	7008020	So there are lights in this house that you see on but the windows are papered over
7008500	7011220	But you can kind of see some light through the paper
7011220	7014900	but mostly you can tell that there is power due to
7015500	7023300	You know the music blaring you can assume unless it was some sort of wireless speaker with a pre-charged phone
7023920	7026580	easily possible in these times, however
7027260	7032760	Most people aren't like flaunting their electricity or flaunting their battery life
7033760	7038720	When they don't write power the rest of the neighborhood is dark around us, yes, okay
7038920	7041360	Yeah, and looking around like it said earlier
7041400	7045840	You honestly can't really tell the difference between the homes that have been foreclosed
7045960	7051440	And the ones that people are living in that don't have power anymore, but this definitely does seem like a place where?
7052320	7058360	Where power is is few and far between cool. I forgot if you answered me earlier. Is it day or night time right now?
7058360	7061720	It is morning. Okay, you guys arrived in it like
7062400	7066280	8 a.m.. 7 a.m.. Somewhere in there, so it's probably
7067080	7071400	9 a.m.. By now cool. What took it's just really far from the airport
7071400	7078240	We were at the airport at 1145 right it says in my notes that the agents arrive at 7 a.m.. On January 6th
7078240	7083480	I don't know why that is if you arrived in st. Louis at 1245
7083480	7086640	But maybe you had to wait we had to wait for lion's choice to open
7086640	7094960	Honestly you probably had to wait for this like and then we do and then we drove the 10 minutes to La Fontaine
7097260	7103920	Yeah, no you you definitely just had to wait for the rest of the like the trail the supplies and everything to get all packed
7103920	7105920	Up and oh that makes sense they realize
7107080	7109080	Yeah, and then like you know
7109760	7111200	Gary wasn't there yet
7111200	7116920	And so they had to wait on Gary and then they realized that they'd loaded up with the wrong supplies into this truck
7116920	7121020	And so they had to switch them out with the supplies that were going into the other truck
7121020	7124560	But they're both going to these her. It's cold out here. That's good
7128080	7130120	How do you guys approach the house quickly
7132360	7136640	So any of you fellas have any kind of crime fight in
7137360	7138760	experience
7138760	7142840	Official vigilante or otherwise oh, yeah, okay?
7143320	7149640	Well, why don't you and I any is anybody here real good at talking as it were?
7150120	7152760	Super cold um yes, I am
7153400	7158800	General alright, I don't know if he's gonna be super receptive to seeing us just with the shotgun
7158800	7163480	So we might want to keep those a little bit hidden, but why don't you talk to this fella, okay?
7163480	7166440	I took the shotgun under my duster
7166440	7173600	And I knock on the door the music is so loud from inside that you know that no matter how hard you knock
7174000	7181200	You're probably not gonna get a response this music is like blaring. Okay. I checked the door is it locked nope I?
7181960	7183480	Open it up
7183480	7190000	What do I see when you open it up one you are here looking at me with a stench you're hit
7190000	7197160	Just like like almost like your hair just goes stands back as it's just like a waft a big
7197360	7200880	waft of this smell that you have smelled
7201400	7202520	now
7202520	7204020	many times
7204020	7205480	today
7205480	7207480	that reminds you of
7208160	7213200	Come I don't know. I'm trying to think of a different way to say that of like it reminds you of
7214000	7216000	your room and
7216000	7218000	Creator
7218040	7219240	But
7219240	7222200	You find as you guys walk into this home
7222960	7228460	Mills has turned his home into a sickening tribute to the flesh
7228760	7236600	The walls are plastered with pornography of every shade some printed from the internet and some from purchased
7236840	7244120	Magazines the TVs and computer screens are all transmitting filth the home reeks of
7245040	7251040	Organic decay and the heat is set as high as it will go
7252400	7259520	It is toasty it is a toaster oven in here and the the oh
7261760	7265900	God everyone everyone roll Constitution except for
7267000	7268440	except for
7268440	7272120	Fast night you're good. No shit. I rolled a one again
7272800	7279120	No way, I promise that is wild less interesting, but I rolled an 83 again
7281120	7283120	No way
7284440	7287680	Yeah, technically that's just as crazy guys so I
7289720	7291720	Failed mine I was a 97
7293720	7295720	So the two of you are
7296480	7302760	Immediately taken aback by everything about this and oh geez cut monster
7304520	7307320	Wentworth just covers his nose with a glove and
7308160	7312360	Maybe wretches a little but yeah, it's the most emotion you guys have seen in
7313240	7316000	Frederickson for God knows how long and
7316640	7318080	maybe ever and
7318080	7323540	As you are adjusting to the inside of this home
7323820	7328720	It's hot as fuck Terrence walks in and the first thing he notices is the heat not the
7329980	7335180	Noxious fumes that are being emitted from everything. Where does the music sound like it's coming from?
7335420	7337420	The music is coming from upstairs
7337980	7339180	would
7339180	7346120	Anyone care to accompany me upstairs for to turn this off? I'm already headed up the stairs
7346120	7348120	So, oh, that's cool that you just did
7350540	7352540	Well, I did it five seconds ago
7354540	7356420	Okay, so
7356420	7362540	Justin is going up the stairs with a smoochie following behind. What are the other two doing?
7363120	7365120	Wentworth is just staying downstairs
7365700	7370500	Trying to overcome how grossed out he is and using the time to like
7371300	7375940	In his acclamation to the room. He's using it to scan the room and take it all in
7376060	7382420	See if there's anything he can glean from the scene downstairs. What's your human? I mean the baseline 10, okay
7382420	7385140	And what is your medicine? I've got a first aid of 30
7385740	7387740	Okay, and what is your alertness?
7388100	7390100	70 on the alertness, okay
7390940	7392940	Thomas does
7393100	7395100	Mark Smith have
7395380	7396700	human or
7396700	7397660	medicine
7397660	7404100	60 human no medicine 50 alertness. Okay. So as you guys are kind of walking around
7405340	7407340	downstairs
7407340	7410560	Justin and Luke as you guys are heading upstairs go ahead and take your headphones off
7413420	7415420	As
7416980	7422140	You guys are walking around oh gosh, let's see Mark Smith you notice that
7422860	7424860	skips descent into madness
7425980	7427980	It takes a path
7428780	7436260	Seems to be layers and layers of pornography that he's can coon himself in with are getting more and more
7436780	7443620	Violent more and more deviant and you kind of begin to think as you're looking around
7444140	7451400	That this was some sort of attempt to cage himself in with his own twisted urges
7452260	7454260	coating the walls and
7454420	7456420	stimulation to prevent himself
7457020	7459020	from leaving and
7459980	7464640	Joe we've got Frederickson with alertness noticing that
7465240	7472360	This is not the house of a bachelor or at least not one as mundane as Mills was before the store because the interior
7472720	7474720	design is gaudy and
7475640	7483500	There are pictures of skip with his mother all over the mantle and I'm gonna go ahead and give these
7484400	7486400	one of these bird fellas
7486760	7493920	To get these boys back in here. Hey Luke, he can't hear me. That's the whole point. His headphones are literally off to
7494800	7496800	We couldn't yell out enough
7505080	7511360	Hi, hey and then so let's have Thomas and Joe take your headphones off as the other two go upstairs
7515520	7520600	Hmm clump clump clump as the two of you are walking up the stairs
7524640	7525520	Oh
7525520	7528800	Terrence fast night as soon as you turn the corner
7528960	7533480	He's got like one of those where you like walk up the set of stairs and then turn a corner to go up to the
7533480	7538440	next set of stairs as soon as you hit that corner and you look up with
7539160	7546040	Henry smoochy literally on your back like right looking over your shoulder the two of you see a
7546440	7548840	man in his early 30s and
7549800	7552320	He is completely naked
7552800	7554800	Cool that's all
7555320	7557640	No, that's not so he is
7559800	7564360	He is just covered in blood and scratches all over him
7564360	7568060	He is emaciated and he looks gaunt and his eyes are like
7568680	7572920	Completely like back in his head like he is not paying attention to you at all
7572920	7579280	But his dick is in his hand and he's just like slowly like hitting it against his thigh
7579600	7586160	Making this like pat pat pat pat pat sound and he turns and looks at you guys and
7586800	7589280	you see something in his eyes and
7590520	7591920	I
7591920	7596320	I need you to roll a humid either one of you or both of you. I have psychotherapy
7597000	7601320	That'll do it. Okay. Oops. Yeah, I didn't pass on humid. I
7602800	7608440	Did not pass either. Okay, so this guy is just like looking at you with these big eyes and he starts
7609200	7611640	walking towards you and he's like
7612560	7614440	Hey
7614440	7617400	Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey, are you guys um
7618320	7620320	You guys are you guys are?
7621400	7623400	You guys are real, right?
7625120	7629200	Skip yeah skip is this you I need you both through all sanity. I
7632040	7637840	Passed 23 on a seven. I got a 17 on a 50. Oh, yeah. No, you guys are real you guys are
7638640	7640640	Oh, yeah
7640720	7642720	Well, I bet you're real
7643520	7645520	Kind of shoulders back
7645520	7651520	He puffs his chest out and he starts kind of like doing one of these where he's like kind of dancing
7651520	7656920	Well a little shoulder movement side to side back and forth and his hips are kind of moving back and forth
7657240	7659240	And he's like, what's up guys?
7659720	7662920	What's up, you coming into my house? You wanna hang out? You wanna have a time?
7663480	7667560	Skip, what are you guys doing? What are you what are you doing? Why aren't you at work?
7667560	7672080	Like no you guys are good. Maybe just one of you probably for now
7672080	7676260	I don't think I could handle both at the same time if you know what I mean, are you looking at you?
7676960	7681880	That's fun. Yeah, what are you guys doing? Who wants to who wants to come who wants to come first?
7681880	7686040	I mean over here not I mean if you want to we could but I read that's probably what?
7686960	7693800	You guys into this skip no. No the fuck is going on here. Sorry. I just I haven't really happened
7693800	7695120	I
7695120	7699760	Really haven't been able to practice my game in a while. You know what I'm talking about
7699760	7703240	But can I see where the music is coming from? Yeah, it's behind him in a room
7703240	7706360	Yeah, you can use like a serious understand him
7706360	7711280	But yeah, it is probably just a stereo blaring in one of the rooms. I get frustrated trying to
7711800	7714760	Figure out what the hell's going on with him and all the loud music
7714760	7719120	So I just I want to go into that room and shut the music off. Okay, so
7720080	7722040	Justin what is fast night doing?
7722040	7725200	I want to shout downstairs for the the other
7725680	7730420	Agents to come up here with us since we found skip sounds good Justin take your headphones off. Okay?
7732080	7734080	Luke as
7734120	7736120	Henry smoochy or rather
7736440	7742680	Glick goes into you you walk right past him and he's like, oh, hey, this guy's up first
7743200	7744760	sounds good and
7744760	7746560	He gets this
7746560	7748120	Huge smile on his face
7748120	7754320	He follows you into the room where you're going to turn off the stereo and you turn it off
7754480	7757080	It's dead silent. And when you turn around
7760000	7762000	As his mouth just like
7762320	7767680	fully opens up and coming out of it is this wiggling worm that is like
7768040	7770240	It's got segments on it
7770240	7776720	But more importantly on the tip of it is just this black gaping hole and on the outside of it
7776720	7780120	there are four bone like needles that are coming out like
7780600	7785960	Tink-tink-tink-tink-tink-tink-tink-tink and they all like a claw like a claw arm
7786400	7792520	Basically in a machine where you win games, but this one they're made of bone and they are
7793280	7797160	Extremely sharp and they are coming right for you
7797160	7802560	Okay, wait just to clarify this thing came out of his mouth is it still connected to him or yes
7802560	7808480	so it seems to be in order mouth worm thing and then
7808880	7815000	Mouth on the end of the worm and then around the mouth are these Ford bone needles coming out
7815200	7820480	also, I love watching Joe and Thomas's face as they're watching this Joe's face is
7820480	7823560	Cracking me up. Anyway, I
7824560	7827040	Need a roll from you
7827960	7833240	Yeah, so get those dice ready. What are you doing to try to combat this or are you gonna happen?
7834240	7836240	well, no, I
7837800	7845560	Let out a scream like ah, oh actually roll sanity first just for important reasons
7845560	7847560	Oh
7849480	7856580	27 on us 50. Okay, so you're still gonna lose one sanity. Okay, and you can scream if you want to
7857560	7862480	Yeah, I scream and while I'm doing that I raise my shotgun up
7862480	7865720	I don't and I pull the trigger but the safety's on
7866360	7870960	What why would you make the safety on without rolling cuz I didn't turn it off cuz
7871520	7875760	He was saying how he likes gun safety, so I try to do that and
7876920	7882440	Before I can like flip it over to turn the safety off. I just like shove the barrel into the thing's mouth
7882520	7883280	Okay, cool
7883280	7888880	so I'll let you roll firearms if you want to if it's higher than melee weapons because you're using the firearm as a
7889400	7893300	Melee weapon and I am rolling and I succeeded with a 28
7893980	7896840	Okay, I got higher firearms. So I
7896840	7898840	I
7898960	7900960	Got an 85. Oh
7901480	7904600	I doubt that's a success. No, that is fit
7905520	7910160	Okay, so it's gonna be one of these I'm gonna bring the rest of the boys in here
7916400	7923340	I turned down the monitor volume on my headphone, so I wouldn't accidentally catch any words, but I still heard a jump-scare in there
7924340	7926340	I heard some screeches
7928980	7930980	Lordy Lordy
7932300	7937780	Smith and Fredrickson from downstairs the two of you here first Justin
7938820	7941780	someone skips up here and it's it's uh
7942300	7944300	Ten seconds later you hear ah
7945220	7951540	Do we hear any like running or footsteps or pounding or anything or just the screen for now? You just hear the screams
7951540	7952740	a
7952740	7956700	Little comforting quick. What's it called when you go back and change something?
7957380	7958900	retcon
7958900	7959780	and
7959780	7961780	quick retroactive
7962100	7965620	Conflagration, what's that word mean? So a proactive re envisioning
7966580	7973460	So the two of you would actually hear fast night hauler and then you would hear the music go
7973980	7980740	Completely silent and then you would hear Henry smoochie scream out and then the two of you decide
7980740	7987360	Yeah, so it's probably a pretty good idea to go up there then I will follow your lead so calm the energy here
7988020	7992100	So calm as the two of you get up to the stairs
7992180	7993620	You see that
7993620	8001220	Terrence fast night is at the corner turn of the stairs waiting for the two of you and you both approach just in time
8001380	8006340	To see Henry smoochie get pushed out of this room
8006820	8011620	Backwards so he's flying out of the doorway of this room up against the wall
8011620	8018260	And he slams is the back of his head into the wall and you see right on top of him right in front of him
8018260	8020260	Is a naked?
8020780	8022780	bleeding cut-up
8022820	8027780	emaciated gaunt just disgusting human being with his dick out and
8028540	8031620	He more importantly than the dick out
8032620	8040280	Protruding from this man's mouth is this weird segmented worm and you see from the side you've got these bony
8041020	8048260	needles that are extremely sharp and there are four of them on the end of this like worms mouth that are coming out and
8048900	8053140	they are attached just on either side of the eyes and
8053740	8056220	just inside the jaw of
8056940	8061260	Henry smoochie and this worm is truck is slowly
8061820	8069740	going into like the bones are holding it in place and the worm is like moving slowly and
8070140	8077860	Trying to wiggle its way into the mouth of Henry smoochie and that is where we're gonna call it for this evening
8082940	8084940	Thing cooking up
8086220	8088220	Thing
8089620	8095620	Patrick Swayze, where are you? We all know it's wrong Kurt Russell not Patrick Swayze, whatever. Holy shit
8095620	8101540	Well, okay. This is getting fucked up. Damn. I just thought the horror was come. I
8102860	8106780	Didn't think nothing else bad bad was gonna happen. I could make it really easy for you
8106780	8111980	I wrestled a gun away from one of the guys and I shoot myself. So there you go
8113260	8115260	that story
8117060	8120560	Want to make it easier for you, I was just gonna shoot the creature but
8123100	8128420	Yeah, that's a that's a way to do it I was gonna yell let it happen I'm enjoying this and
8131380	8133380	Like peace out everybody
8134180	8137340	Okay. Yeah, that's just let's just get back into character do that real quick and then we'll be done
8139940	8142220	Yeah, you know what if we all accept the worm
8142220	8144220	I
8144980	8151820	Fuck I fucking accept the worm become worm. Oh didn't think of that DM digit that everybody would band together to
8154700	8160660	That's step in line let the monster eat you you guys can try to take over the town of you know
8161500	8163500	Wherever you're at that I wrote down somewhere

8171940	8175820	Okay, that would be fun. But can we do it in one where we're not come worms?
8177820	8179820	I'll only do it if I get to become
8197340	8199340	Oh
8227340	8229340	You
