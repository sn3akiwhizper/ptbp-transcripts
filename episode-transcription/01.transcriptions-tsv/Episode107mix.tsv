0	4000	Welcome to the cream zone, my pastries.
4000	8000	It's your putrid patissier, Papa Wolf the dog,
8000	11620	and I am here to cover all the butter-filled dough
11620	15420	in various sweet sauces of my choosing.
15420	18760	I hope y'all like some sweet grease.
18760	23760	I am rolling out that dough live from 694.2 PTBP,
24260	26640	the only radio station that doubles
26640	29440	as a bakery in the dream times.
29440	33280	Now I know y'all know that I love kneading that dough,
33280	37080	but what I really need is some external validation
37080	39400	from the listeners of my show.
39400	41200	I have a need to knead,
41200	44980	but my need to be kneaded is so much greater.
44980	48440	This howling with Wolf was sent in by Modern Cannabis
48440	50700	from Grand Junction, Colorado,
50700	53920	who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod
53920	57120	an equally meaningful and easy thing to do.
57120	58120	He writes,
58160	60720	Hey Wolf, the music you put out pleases
60720	62800	the deepest depths of my soul.
62800	64840	Keep spinning those great tunes
64840	68000	and munching on the slimiest of fine foods.
68000	70920	I hope those contention boys you keep telling us about
70920	73960	manage to vacuum up all that nasty ooze
73960	75760	I keep seeing out and about.
75760	79520	And lastly, a shout out to the best playing group
79520	81840	a fledgling keeper could ask for.
81840	86240	Kyle, Lexi, and Moriah couldn't ask for a better group
86240	90680	of funny, smart, and kind people to play with.
90680	93920	Lots of love, Modern Cannabis.
93920	96520	Well damn, thanks Modern Cannabis.
96520	99720	It sounds like you got a good group of buddies there.
99720	102980	I wish, I wish I had a couple of buddies
102980	105120	that were funny, smart, and kind.
105120	110120	All I got is my producer and my dog, Wolf the dog, the dog.
110760	114800	My producer is a piece of shit and Wolf the dog, the dog
114800	117280	merely tolerates my existence.
117280	120280	Maybe one day I'll have a friend too.
120280	122880	If you want to write up something for your pastry loving
122880	125680	Wolf the howl, write up a five star review
125680	128520	on Apple podcasts and send a screenshot
128520	131120	to pretendingpod at gmail.com
131120	133920	or just tag the show at pretending pod
133920	136120	on Instagram or Twitter.
136120	139120	In return, you can put words in my mouth.
139120	141000	What a damn deal.
141000	143860	And while you're using your fingers to peruse
143860	147080	the unfathomable thing that is the internet,
147080	149740	stop by the damn subreddit.
149740	152880	Some kid named Luke shit posts there constantly
152880	155640	with the finesse of an Olympic athlete.
155640	158040	Or join us on the discord.
158040	161460	The community is just as sweet as they are filthy.

172380	175340	The newest one from an ongoing Delta green
175340	178300	home brew campaign just dropped.
178300	182380	And that wily PTBP crew continues on live
182380	185100	in the den of sin this Friday night,
185100	188940	August 20th at 9.30 PM central time.
188940	192400	If I've said it once, I hope my producer saves the clip
192400	194920	so he can just play that audio again.
194920	198900	The links are in the damn show notes.
198940	202620	Here at the end of this story, there's everything to lose.
202620	207340	But no matter how gory, I'll be here with the news.
207340	210740	Last time Keith bumped into Silas Cole,
210740	214640	John had questions for his newest father figure
214640	218540	and Clark accidentally unleashed the other worldly beast
218540	222820	he's been freaking out about since episode 31.
222820	225940	But hey, at least this horrifying behemoth
225940	228220	is made of the dripping ooze that's plagued
228260	229940	the groups every step.
229940	234280	And also, thankfully, the incomprehensible monster
234280	238040	is mounted by an anatomically upgraded assassin
238040	240320	dressed as Fonzie that's controlled
240320	242380	by an unnatural metal ball,
242380	245600	hell bent on the destruction of humanity.
245600	248060	So that's nice.
248060	250820	Seems like a good time to take a hard look around
250820	253920	and ask yourselves, what's your favorite bop
253920	256580	with an open question as the title?
256580	258780	And why is it Drag It In 3
258780	261620	with What Kinda World Are You Livin' In?
261620	266620	["What Kinda World Are You Livin' In"]
291620	296620	["What Kinda World Are You Livin' In"]
301660	305740	When Thomas dies, you'll get his podcast money.
305740	309220	Can I have all your stuff and your points in the podcast?
309220	311520	Oh, like my points in the podcast so far?
311520	315340	Like, as far as the leaderboards go?
315340	317140	Yes, the leaderboards that I have.
317140	317980	You've never seen this whiteboard.
317980	319420	The fans don't know about this,
319420	321260	but there is a complicating scoring system
321780	323340	that Zach uses to keep us funny.
323340	326260	To keep you.
326260	327540	And just to keep you.
327540	330220	You know, just like working with any auteur,
330220	334060	there's some give and take with working with Zach.
334060	336920	He gotta give a little, and he takes a lot,
336920	339780	and that's how you make art.
339780	344780	So, you know, if that requires manipulating
344860	349420	and breaking down your players until they,
349420	352860	until they, you know, until they're not themselves anymore,
352860	355340	they're just little balls of clay that you can mold.
355340	356700	That's what Zach's done for us.
356700	357900	You're all Jenna Maroney,
357900	360040	and I'm the bad guy from Iron Man 2.
361040	362260	Mickey Rooney?
362260	363860	Or not Mickey Rooney.
363860	364860	Wait, yeah?
364860	365700	Mickey Rourke.
365700	366540	No.
366540	367380	Mickey Rourke?
367380	368700	Mickey Rooney?
368700	370220	Mickey Rooney?
370220	372380	If all the Jenna Maroney, Mickey Rourke jokes
372380	373580	were about Mickey Rooney,
373580	376260	were about Mickey Rooney,
376260	377900	that would elevate an already great bit.
377900	380780	Wait, I think I just realized
380780	384660	that they are about Mickey Rourke and not Mickey Rooney,
384660	386620	which I was so confused by.
386620	387660	Wow.
387660	388500	Wow.
388500	392500	I just finished rewatching 30 Rock 2, so that's hilarious.
392500	394540	I've got a gripe to complain.
394540	396340	And she's like, tell me more.
397580	400240	What's up with iPhones today?
400240	403460	Is that Mickey Rooney or is that Iago?
403460	404380	That's more Mickey Rooney.
404380	406900	Well, you went a little Gilbert.
406940	408500	What's going on?
408500	409340	What?
409340	410160	All right, no.
413160	415580	So when we started recording this campaign
415580	419180	over three and a half years ago,
419180	421780	did you expect these small town contention cops
421780	424740	to end up fighting a partial Android dressed like Fonzie
424740	427260	controlled by an unnatural metal ball consciousness
427260	430140	that's riding an oozing shadowy ape kaiju
430140	432120	in an alternate plane of existence
432120	434260	as the future Messiah of a cult,
434260	436320	the founder of contention slash inventor
436600	438400	who created all these weird science items
438400	440600	and one of those inventions itself
440600	442800	in the body of its adopted father
442800	445380	alongside that adopted father's brother
445380	448720	who can burn people with his hands in reverse time itself?
449880	452020	No, I thought it would be something a lot cooler.
452020	453520	Probably like 10% of them.
453520	456800	Well, I'm just gonna open up this little envelope
456800	459720	that I made for myself at the beginning of all this.
459720	463760	And yeah, all those predictions are written right down here.
464760	467800	No, no, wait, Joe, show that to the camera.
467800	468620	Here, hang on.
468620	470920	You'll see I did write down,
470920	474480	I thought her name was gonna be Mary Beth.
474480	478480	I didn't write Rosemary, so I whiffed it on that one.
478480	479840	Whiffed it on that one pretty bad.
479840	481240	What did Beth stand for?
481240	485120	Better entity, time heathen.
488320	489160	Damn, Joe.
489160	490000	That's really solid.
490000	494320	Can time heathens be like the theme of our second season?
494320	495720	Yeah, well, no,
495720	499400	because I never wanna do time travel again, but.
499400	501800	The name of our prog band?
501800	504120	Yeah, time heathens fucking rules.
505440	507360	I know time bandits has a special place
507360	508320	in a lot of people's heart,
508320	510480	but if that movie was called time heathens,
511560	512400	I think it would be unbeatable.
512400	513880	What about clock stoppers?
513880	515400	That movie was great.
515400	518400	Is that like when you like interrupt two people
518400	521200	who are definitely gonna get it on?
521200	522040	Wait, no.
522040	522880	You said clock.
522880	524120	That's cock blockers.
525160	527000	Clock stoppers.
528600	532080	Clock stoppers has the weirdest ratio of being so bad
532080	534560	and being something I've thought about
534560	536280	ever since I've seen that movie.
536280	538160	Like the ability to stop time
538160	539840	and what you can do with that. It's not a good movie,
539840	543320	but like I've thought about it at least once a year
543320	546040	since I've seen it, probably more often than not.
546040	547280	Right?
547280	549240	Have you guys seen Time Fuckers?
550200	553240	Is that about the guys who fuck goobs?
555880	557720	That's spice holes.
560400	561680	Cilantro's.
563960	567560	Time Fuckers is just about this dog.
567560	568400	A dog?
570800	571640	Cool.
571640	573480	Right on.
573480	576360	I just watched Back to the Future for the first time.
576360	577200	Really?
577960	580280	You know that was originally gonna be called Time Fuckers?
582480	583320	That makes sense.
583320	587920	I heard a fact today that I didn't verify,
587920	589400	so I should probably check it
589400	591160	before I spread misinformation,
591160	592080	but I'm just gonna say it.
592080	594640	Apparently, The Muppet Show,
594640	596880	they made two pilots for that originally.
596880	597800	And one of them was called
597800	601720	The Muppets Sex and Drug Show or something like that.
601720	603280	And I don't know if that meant that they were gonna go
603280	605920	with an adult route for it, but that's what it was called.
605920	607760	It was like, The Muppets Sex and Drugs.
607760	609920	Or whether they were just gonna teach kids
609920	611360	about sex and drugs.
612800	613640	I don't know what the-
613640	615600	Like a reverse dare program?
615600	618640	This is a great scenario to introduce
618640	620840	without having any of the background for it,
620840	623040	because we can just wildly speculate
623040	625040	until Luke ruins it by looking it up.
626040	626880	Don't ruin it.
626880	627720	Don't look it up yet.
627720	628540	Don't ruin it.
628540	629380	Don't talk to him.
629380	630200	Don't talk to him.
630200	631360	It's violence.
631360	632200	Oh, even better.
632200	633040	That's right, yeah.
633040	635480	Okay, so is the pitch there that the network
635920	638320	is like, give us two ideas for a show
638320	640280	and they really wanna make The Muppets Show
640280	642040	and they're like, I guess if we give them
642040	644400	The Muppets Sex and Violence,
644400	646340	they gotta make The Muppets Show.
648680	651200	Oh my God, just thinking of like a Gritty.
651200	655320	Like Gritty in the sex and violence show, yeah.
655320	657040	Oh my God.
657040	659560	I mean, Gritty is the epitome of sex and violence.
659560	661360	Gritty is the ultimate villain of The Muppets.
661360	663120	Or the hero.
663120	666480	What about Gritty just as a detective in Philadelphia?
666480	668040	Sex and violence.
668040	669400	Gritty, sex and violence unit.
669400	671260	Gritty, sex and violence.
672640	675200	Yeah, SVU stands for sex and violence unit.
675200	677240	Gritty, sex and violence unit.
677240	679680	Gritty and his partner, Chris Maloney,
679680	682300	have to take on the mean streets.
684400	685240	Just fucking.
685240	686800	Remember when everybody saw Chris Maloney's
686800	689040	like ass in his pants a few months ago
689040	691680	and that was trending all over the place?
691680	692520	And people were like,
692520	694320	why is Chris Maloney's ass so good?
694320	695400	It makes sense.
695400	696240	Google that.
696240	697440	The man's got a rump.
697440	699200	That guy has a great ass.
699200	700660	He's got a real ass face.
702160	703620	You know when you look at somebody's face
703620	705620	and you can tell they got a nice dumper?
709400	711440	That jawline looks like it shits.
711440	712800	This is something I wanted to bring up.
712800	715200	Somebody on the Discord, you said like,
715200	716700	you know when you look at a person's face
716700	719840	and you see what you want to see and not what's there?
719840	721480	I don't know what that means.
722120	722960	And one person was like,
722960	724680	I wonder if Zach has a little face blindness.
724680	726360	And I just wanted to know if that,
726360	727880	do you think you do or?
727880	729440	Yeah, it's a good point, Luke.
731120	732600	Thanks.
732600	733440	What?
737580	740240	No, I just meant that when you are familiar
740240	742920	with someone over time,
742920	746000	you see them differently than I think that you would
746000	749320	if you were just seeing them as a stranger on the street.
749320	752160	I think that your perception of your relationship to them
752160	754000	and the way that they've treated you
754000	755100	and the way you've treated them
755100	757320	and the way that you perceive their actions
757320	758880	and the way other people perceive them
758880	761480	changes the way that you view them physically.
761480	762320	Yeah.
762320	763480	That's where I disagree.
763480	764320	Yeah, I know.
764320	765280	It's just my opinion.
765280	767120	And all of science backs me up.
767120	771280	Right, right.
771280	772840	It's just my factual opinion.
772840	775040	I forgot about those studies that you forwarded me,
775040	776360	which was like, hey, in the future,
776360	777420	if you ever need to know,
777420	779580	and Zach just sent me all these links
779580	782940	that were clearly to like crudely handmade websites,
782940	786260	but it was like University of Florida study confirms.
786260	787300	Science says.
787300	788140	Yeah, science says.
788140	790940	Scienceblockspot.com.
790940	793420	Anything Zach says in the future is correct.
793420	796060	Shitscientistsay.com.
796060	798460	And I was drunk enough the first few arguments
798460	801260	that that worked, but no more.
805040	806460	Oh boy.
806460	807580	I'm nervous.
807580	809060	My hands are sweating.
809060	810740	Fucking get over it, Zach.
810740	812740	Pull your shit together.
812740	813900	I'm kidding, it's okay.
813900	818100	Rose M-A-R-Y, a gaunt woman with crazy hair
818100	820060	and enormous thick glasses
820060	823300	that make her already large eyes look even bigger,
823300	826780	dripping with muck from every orifice,
826780	830460	wearing jeans and a white t-shirt with a leather jacket,
830460	833900	leapt off the back of her commandeered four wheeler
833900	837420	and mounted this thing of Clark's nightmares.
837420	839140	The four metal tentacles
839140	841340	that protrude from the back of her neck
841340	845820	wrapped around this incomprehensibly enormous beast
845820	848820	that drips with pure darkness.
848820	851380	And the camera dollied left
851380	855420	as this lumbering monster raced toward the ledge
855420	858860	of its unnatural toilet paper roll treadmill.
858860	861140	And as it falls,
861140	865380	the camera turns 90 degrees sideways
865380	869420	to match the change of the gravitational pull.
869420	874260	The luminous land on which you all stand shakes
874260	879260	as the Gigantumbra pithicus arrives on your axis
879660	884260	and Rose M-A-R-Y, muscle memory engaged,
884260	889020	leans back and casually throws a double thumbs up
889020	893700	as the goddamn muck and Mairi behemoth beneath her
893700	897780	roars in real sanity.
898620	900820	Oh, fuck.
902140	904340	I brought everything out here but my dice.
904340	906060	Yeah, I failed.
906060	910060	There should be some right in front of you, Thomas,
910060	912340	in the little, can you hear me?
914140	915620	You can still tell them where they are.
915620	917380	In the thing.
917420	919340	Nice, fucking nailed it.
919340	920980	The yarn boat.
920980	923780	Yarn boat, baby, yarn boat.
923780	924860	It's so yarny.
924860	926100	93, I fail.
926100	927940	How'd you do there, Clark Bishop?
927940	929660	You probably need me to roll again, right?
929660	932780	That's because it's bad audio or something, right?
933820	936460	This is the most I've ever wanted to lie about a roll,
936460	938700	I think, in the history of the show,
938700	941140	but it's an 82, so that's over my power.
941140	943420	Oh, right, mine's way over my power too, yeah.
943420	946900	Oh, I rolled over my power too.
946900	948500	I had a lot of time to think about
948500	950460	if I would lie about that roll or not.
952540	954980	I was sitting there stewing, looking at the dice
954980	956660	and saying, man, I could just say,
956660	959500	I could just say it's under my power.
959500	962340	I've lied about exactly one roll
962340	963900	in the history of this podcast.
963900	968100	It happened recently and I feel super, super bad about it.
968100	968940	Oh, shit.
969900	970900	Wow.
970900	972820	That's just, for all the role players out there,
972820	974380	don't do it, don't do it.
974380	975220	There's no-
975500	977460	I hate to do this, you're out.
978820	980020	We signed a contract.
982420	983340	That's fair.
984740	986300	We did a blood oath with Zach
986300	987980	that we would never lie to him.
987980	991300	Even as jokingly, that made me want to cry.
994540	996260	I'm sorry, dude.
996260	998460	At least you've learned your fucking lesson.
999900	1001460	I just wanted to scare Joe straight
1001460	1003140	and any other listeners.
1005220	1006420	In the prison sense.
1006420	1007260	You like that?
1007260	1008820	You like the use of that language there, Thomas?
1008820	1009660	Well, that's not what that-
1009660	1011020	Feel good about that?
1011020	1013460	I felt awkward about it as soon as it came out of my mouth,
1013460	1015860	but that's not the intention of the phrase.
1016700	1019780	Prison, it's scared straight, not great.
1022620	1024340	Scared straight, not great.
1024340	1026820	I felt with a 52, which is over my power.
1026820	1027660	Oh my God.
1027660	1028740	This is the worst.
1028740	1030420	Yeah, this might be the end here.
1030420	1031500	If you would have succeeded-
1031500	1032580	Just take this one from the top.
1032580	1033420	You would have-
1035580	1036900	Yeah, Zach, how do you feel about
1036900	1038500	lying about some rolls right now?
1040300	1042500	How do you feel about lying about an episode?
1045900	1047100	I'm not going to do it.
1047100	1049380	Everything you planned this week down the shitter.
1049380	1052540	1d4 would have been your sanity damage
1052540	1054260	if you would have succeeded that check.
1054260	1057700	So I need everyone to do 1d8 plus one.
1057700	1058820	Holy shit.
1058820	1059940	Oh my God.
1059940	1062060	This really might be the end.
1062060	1063980	Three for me, two plus one.
1065540	1066380	Oh my God.
1066380	1068620	I rolled a one.
1068620	1070060	You fucker.
1070060	1073820	And I had to because I've only got four sanity, so.
1073820	1074940	Holy shit.
1074940	1075940	Oh damn.
1075940	1078420	I rolled a three plus one is four,
1078420	1082020	which brings me down to 12
1082020	1085540	and my breaking point is 10, so I'm good.
1085540	1087460	I take that back about having only four sanity.
1087460	1088300	I had seven.
1088300	1089540	I was looking at my breaking point.
1089540	1092420	So I'm at five total now with a breaking point of four.
1093420	1095020	Damn, dude.
1095660	1097220	This is bleak.
1097220	1098500	Although I did kind of prepare
1098500	1100540	because the next sentence in my notes is
1100540	1103180	resolve what will probably be a shit show.
1104900	1105740	Yeah.
1107300	1108900	Why would you think that?
1108900	1111180	I didn't hit my breaking point.
1111180	1112020	No one did.
1113140	1114260	No one hit their breaking point
1114260	1116300	and no one rolled five or more sanity.
1116300	1118740	So we don't have to do fight, flight or freeze.
1118740	1121980	And we don't have to take on any new manias,
1121980	1124820	but you did all roll over your power.
1125500	1128060	In combat order, which we are now in,
1128060	1129980	we're going to go through that.
1129980	1134980	And Don automatically, with an extreme sanity hit here,
1136140	1139740	even at your zero sanity,
1139740	1141380	we'll peek behind the curtain there,
1141380	1143420	Don D. Pettymore fully insane.
1143420	1146740	Yeah, mine is zero right now.
1146740	1147580	And who knows how long.
1147580	1148740	Did you roll over zero?
1148740	1151660	Yeah, I tried to roll, but I was just like, man.
1151660	1153780	The dice just stopped midair.
1153900	1154900	Threw it in the air.
1156580	1157420	You're a fatal.
1157420	1159020	Go ahead and roll, Justin, real quick for me.
1159020	1159860	Gotcha.
1161580	1162700	Oh, 15.
1162700	1163540	Okay.
1163540	1164900	Yeah, it's not over my willpower though,
1164900	1167580	but yeah, it's a little over zero.
1169700	1172460	Keith Vigna, you are standing next to yourself
1172460	1177340	as you see this lumbering beast roar
1177340	1182340	and the hair on your head is pushed back
1182540	1185300	by the sheer power of this roar.
1185300	1190260	Keith looks at the monster and at Rosemary
1190260	1192820	and then at all the people surrounding him
1192820	1196220	and he kind of starts to back away
1196220	1199940	until he looks down at himself on the ground
1201980	1205740	and sees the belts laying next to him.
1205740	1210740	And he grabs the belts and puts it around his own neck
1212500	1215500	but not his own neck, but his own neck
1216540	1221540	and starts to strangle Silas, Keith, Beans, Cole.
1226180	1228140	Silas Cole is far too weak
1228140	1231540	and the blood in his body is all in the wrong places
1231540	1235620	in order to resist this in a confident fashion.
1235620	1236860	Also, as I'm doing that,
1236860	1239420	I'm using one hand to kind of like strangle him
1239460	1242620	and one hand to massage the blood back up into his head.
1248860	1251460	Put it back, put it back, put it back, put it back.
1251460	1253140	I don't know why you brought this thing here.
1253140	1255620	A slender, muscular man in a black t-shirt
1255620	1257820	with tribal tattoo sleeves on both arms
1257820	1260380	going down his hands and fingertips
1260380	1264460	with friend branded on his forehead,
1264460	1267980	completely overwhelmed by terror,
1268020	1271660	knows that the only thing he can do in this moment
1271660	1274260	is try to take this thing down
1274260	1278580	and he sprints toward this huge creature
1278580	1280820	and he runs and he has this staff
1280820	1283140	made of pure darkness in his hand
1283140	1285260	and he's whipping it back and forth
1285260	1288460	on either side of him to build up momentum and speed
1288460	1290780	as he's sprinting toward this thing.
1290780	1294420	And as he's about to jump to take his blow
1294420	1299020	against this tree-sized limb that is hitting the ground,
1299020	1303820	this bipedal creature just lifts one of its legs
1303820	1308460	and stomps on the top of Germaine Glass,
1308460	1313260	pushing him fully into the luminous land you all stand on.
1313260	1318260	You see the body of Germaine Glass become engulfed
1318860	1323020	in the oozing darkness of this creature
1323020	1326980	and the entirety of Germaine Glass's body
1326980	1330260	dissipates into the leg
1330260	1333340	and as he is consumed,
1333340	1337660	the creature grows ever so slightly.
1337660	1338500	Oh no.
1340540	1343820	Clark Bishop, you see red.
1343820	1345940	Someone has to pay for this.
1345940	1349340	Clark had just done that to-do haka-noose thing
1349340	1351100	and it didn't work at fucking all
1351100	1353140	and in fact, it broke it loose.
1354060	1357300	So that's what he is flipped out about now.
1357300	1359300	I think he wants to try again
1359300	1361420	because he now is filled with rage.
1361420	1363420	He wants to hurt that thing
1363420	1365820	that he accidentally now has let loose.
1365820	1366660	I think that's the thing
1366660	1368820	he wants to try to take out his aggression on.
1369900	1371860	He's gonna try another spell
1371860	1373540	even though he doesn't know spells.
1373540	1376940	He's gonna try and summon it up from within him to do it.
1376940	1377780	I love it.
1377780	1379060	I love it.
1379100	1380820	Go ahead and roll a natural.
1381700	1382540	Oh, shit.
1389740	1392940	Are we doing the lying thing now?
1392940	1397620	Yes, yes, fuck yes.
1400860	1403660	It's an 81 on a 63.
1403660	1405620	Ooh-wee.
1405620	1406700	This is the worst.
1406700	1407660	I hate this.
1407660	1408500	This sucks.
1410060	1414140	You're laughing and giggling like it's fun though.
1414140	1416100	Fuck this game you've made us play.
1416100	1416940	And I love it.
1419820	1421820	I'm really happy personally
1421820	1423380	and I'm rooting for you guys
1423380	1425620	but I'm stoked about what just happened.
1425620	1427700	Clark, go ahead and chant for me.
1429700	1431860	Microwave dinner!
1431860	1435020	Microwave dinner!
1435100	1438500	Microwave dinner!
1439500	1441340	A powerful and ancient spell.
1442340	1446780	This enormous, powerful wave of these waves,
1446780	1450340	these tiny radiation waves emit from your mouth
1450340	1454340	and hit direct on this enormous lumbering creature
1454340	1458020	that is at least five stories tall.
1458020	1462820	And as it hits, this thing begins to crumble.
1465500	1468020	Like an ooze that is dissipating,
1468020	1470860	like a slug with salt being poured on it
1470860	1474660	and Rosemary is slightly losing her balance on top.
1474660	1478540	And then the vibration of this muck
1478540	1480380	inside of this creature
1480380	1482820	and covering the entirety of its outside
1482820	1487820	and its limbs go into itself before it splits
1487820	1492820	into two separate equally sized gigantumbra pithicuses
1493660	1495580	that are the same size as the original
1495580	1498540	but now there's two of them in front of you
1498540	1501060	and Rosemary is on one.
1502580	1506260	They put out their hands to each other
1506260	1508260	like Romeo and Juliet
1508260	1511940	in the Leonardo DiCaprio version in the class
1511940	1516140	and then they turn their massive, unnatural,
1516140	1520860	oozy, ape-like heads to face you all.
1520860	1522180	You done fucked up, Clark.
1522180	1524620	Oh, fuck.
1525900	1527020	Oh, shit.
1527020	1528140	My bad, my bad.
1529180	1531860	Don D. Pettymore, you hear a phone ringing.
1531860	1534380	Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.
1534380	1537500	It's the, do y'all hear that?
1537500	1538860	John, do you hear that?
1538860	1540420	Do y'all hear that?
1540420	1541900	It's the phone.
1541900	1545660	And I start walking in the direction
1545660	1547940	that the phone is, seemingly oblivious
1547940	1548860	to everything around me.
1548860	1550380	I didn't hear anything, Don.
1550380	1555020	Which is the opposite direction of this gigantic beast
1555020	1558820	and you are walking toward the towering building
1558820	1560260	in the opposite direction.
1560260	1563500	I'd start walking at first but I'm picking up speed
1563500	1566220	while muttering to myself about the phone.
1566220	1569060	We can, we can fix all the, I can fix this.
1569060	1570140	I can fix this.
1570140	1572500	Like you can kind of hear him like repeating
1572500	1574500	things like that over and over again.
1574500	1575340	Radical.
1575340	1576740	John, your turn.
1576740	1578620	Having rolled over his power,
1578620	1583620	John Lee Kevin Ball has lost sight of what he is.
1584580	1586540	It finally all washes over him.
1586540	1590540	The split bodies, the lives, everything
1590540	1592860	and it's more than he can handle.
1593820	1595620	And the situation is overwhelming
1595620	1600460	but all he sees is Keith Beans killing his daddy.
1601420	1606420	A white like glow pops out, you know,
1607380	1611060	from the back of Sam Elliott's neck
1611060	1613540	and a silver ball shoots into the air.
1613540	1616860	Sam Elliott crumples like a little puppet.
1617980	1619060	Just to the ground.
1619060	1621380	Like you, like you cut its strings.
1623220	1625860	And, and there is, there is a silver ball
1625860	1629700	racing straight for Keith and Silas.
1634460	1635380	Holy shit.
1635380	1640380	Rose M-A-R-Y pinches the cuticle on her thumb
1640900	1643980	and begins to peel.
1643980	1648100	She pulls off a long strip of skin
1648100	1652260	from her nail bed to the crook of her elbow.
1652260	1653100	Hey Zach.
1653100	1653940	And blood.
1653940	1655220	Yeah, yeah, yeah, what's up man?
1655220	1656060	Ew.
1656060	1656900	Can we fuck that?
1659220	1660460	Hey Zach, can you not?
1661500	1663660	Yeah, we tried to keep sex out of the podcast
1663660	1665060	but if you could, you know,
1665060	1667580	obviously you're getting very, you're getting very,
1667580	1670220	I think it's gross when people force sex into role-playing
1670220	1672260	but we want to fuck that.
1678820	1683820	And this beautiful slit just has blood pouring out of it.
1684380	1685340	You're not going to get me
1685340	1687220	like you did with Giant Gash, buddy.
1687220	1688620	It's not going to work twice.
1689620	1694620	Blood pours down onto one of these gloomy beasts
1694940	1699940	as she pulls off the skin on her forearm like fancy gloves,
1700780	1705500	fingers first, and then one smooth removal.
1705500	1710500	Rose M-A-R-Y reveals a silver metal structure
1710980	1714780	and she cackles into the sky above.
1715460	1720460	You poor, pitiful animals.
1721820	1726820	You needed to so desperately remove me from your world.
1727700	1732700	You hunted me and my children, my creations for what reason?
1734460	1738620	Because we were already where you desire to be?
1738620	1741820	Or do you hate yourselves as well?
1741860	1746460	Regardless, humanity has had a good run,
1746460	1749020	much better than you deserved.
1749020	1754020	You claim to admire kindness and you reward the brutal.
1754340	1757700	You insist patience is a virtue
1757700	1760820	and you take advantage of the forgiving.
1760820	1763100	You honor loyalty?
1763100	1765980	It took absolutely zero effort.
1765980	1768460	And she points at Silas Cole,
1768460	1771300	fool branded across his forehead.
1771300	1774900	For one of your own to spill the beans
1774900	1779540	on the location of humankind's destruction.
1779540	1784540	I am going to take these black shiny devils
1785540	1789780	back to your world, break through Beans Pond
1789780	1792260	into the underground temple,
1792260	1797260	which houses vat upon vat of my beautiful residue.
1798260	1802060	Rise back up with a colossal strength
1802060	1805620	your minds could not begin to comprehend.
1805620	1810620	And then finally I am going to consume everything you know.
1814020	1816860	John Lee Pettyball stops dead in his tracks
1816860	1817740	searing towards that.
1817740	1820780	He had been speeding towards Keith and Silas,
1820780	1824100	but he stops, the ball turns around
1824100	1826300	from kind of just like the ground
1827180	1829180	and the air around you.
1829180	1833140	You hear the ball speaking and it says to Rosemary,
1834100	1836980	did you really just take the time
1836980	1841140	to fucking throw in a beans pun in your villain speech?
1844460	1848020	And that's enough to snap him out of his mania I think.
1849180	1850460	He's offended by that.
1850620	1855620	Pettymores never weren't much for poorly placed pun.
1862860	1866260	If your wordplay wasn't impeccable at a pettymore barbecue,
1866260	1869060	you would be ruthlessly scolded and ridiculed.
1872020	1877020	The second enormous gargantuan five-story tall creature
1878020	1881260	melts itself down into a puddle of ooze
1881260	1885620	and begins to climb the gigantic umbra pithicus
1885620	1888220	that Rosemary rides on,
1888220	1893220	making it twice as tall and twice as wide.
1893700	1898700	There is now a 10-story tall ape-like,
1899340	1903100	shadowy, dripping darkness kaiju
1903100	1904380	that is standing before you.
1904580	1907980	Rosemary is almost impossible to see.
1907980	1910220	She's 10 stories high off the ground
1910220	1912580	riding on the head of this creature
1912580	1916220	and you see her tentacles are just waving about
1916220	1919740	like she can't even control how fucking stoked she is
1919740	1921460	about the situation.
1921460	1922280	I'm gonna pee.
1922280	1924040	It will literally take 20 seconds.
1925500	1930500	One, two, three, four, five, six.
1930820	1933180	I'll believe it when I see it.
1934180	1935500	And hear it.
1936540	1941140	Springfield, Missouri ranked number 56
1941140	1944660	out of the top 200 biggest cities in the United States
1944660	1948660	for zombie apocalypse preparedness.
1948660	1949500	Yeah, that's pretty good.
1949500	1950740	I think you'd rate higher.
1950740	1952580	Shame we couldn't handle a real issue.
1952580	1953420	Yeah.
1953420	1955660	You shut the fuck up.
1955660	1958060	There's a building downtown that-
1958060	1959620	Like liberals.
1959660	1963180	My mom told me when I was like a teenager maybe,
1963180	1964300	so I don't know if she was correct.
1964300	1965140	I never looked this up.
1965140	1966260	I don't know if she was correct or not,
1966260	1967460	but there's a building downtown
1967460	1969380	that does nanotechnology work
1969380	1970820	and part of what the research was
1970820	1972820	was reanimating dead cells.
1972820	1975340	And so I've always thought we're gonna be ground zero
1975340	1979100	for any shit that goes zombie like that.
1979100	1980740	Just like the Delta's area.
1980740	1982900	68, 69.
1982900	1983740	Yep.
1983740	1985700	69 seconds, much longer than 20.
1985700	1986780	Much longer than 20.
1986820	1990460	I didn't start peeing until 13 seconds.
1990460	1994740	That's when I was in the bathroom and had things going.
1994740	1995580	I stopped at 38.
1995580	1997260	Well, it's hard to piss when you're rock hard.
1997260	2000540	I stopped shaking at 45,
2000540	2002140	and then I got back here.
2002140	2004060	That's a good shake.
2004060	2006660	Well, you know, as you get older, it takes longer.
2007860	2010660	My pee comes out faster than it's ever.
2010660	2013780	To make it quicker, I usually just shake it while I pee.
2013780	2015980	Slap it, whack it, throw it against the wall,
2016020	2017620	but until you put it back in your pants,
2017620	2019500	the last drop won't fall.
2019500	2020340	That's true.
2020340	2023780	Also, people who say if you shake it more than two times
2023780	2025900	or whatever, you're playing with yourself,
2025900	2029540	I don't know what kind of fucking fuck that person.
2029540	2031060	Yeah, fuck them.
2031060	2032580	They don't know what it's like to pee.
2032580	2033960	All right, well, this is the anthem,
2033960	2036540	so you guys should throw all your hands up.
2036540	2038140	Who was that?
2038140	2039340	Good Charlotte.
2039340	2041100	Good Charlotte, that's right.
2041100	2043660	Shake it once, that's fine.
2043700	2046540	Shake it twice, that's okay.
2046540	2050380	Shake it three times, you're playing with yourself.
2052780	2053620	Wait, really?
2053620	2054460	There's a song?
2054460	2057100	Yeah, that's the bridge of a song.
2057100	2059060	That's what I knew it from, yeah.
2059060	2063500	That song was the theme song of Madden 2003.
2063500	2066720	So it played every single time you opened that game,
2066720	2071060	so I had that song stuck in my head for years.
2071060	2073700	That album's pretty good for what it is.
2073700	2077620	That sounds like exactly the peak Madden year for Zaggy.
2077620	2080340	Little 11-year-old Zach, love that shit.
2080340	2081940	This creature just became enormous.
2081940	2083220	Thomas got hard, went pee.
2083220	2086580	So now we are at Keith.
2086580	2089340	Keith is strangling Keith,
2089340	2094340	but he hears beans between Mary and John Ball, Jovi.
2094340	2099340	Mary and John Ball, Jovi, he hears beans three times.
2104180	2107260	This damn beans pun is gonna be a downfall.
2107260	2109740	He hears beans three times
2109740	2112700	and it snaps him out of it.
2112700	2115340	He's hearing his last name
2115340	2118740	and he loses his grip on the belt
2118740	2121840	and stops massaging the blood up to Keith's head.
2122280	2127280	He looks at his friends around him
2128920	2132720	and he's like, she just told us her plan.
2132720	2135040	We can stop her now.
2135040	2137140	You hear reverberating around you.
2137140	2139300	Yeah, that's like a classic villain mistake
2139300	2143560	to just give it all away in the big reveal speech.
2143560	2146400	I completely agree, I'm on your side.
2146400	2147440	Keith.
2147440	2149520	Do you choke him less?
2149520	2152040	I drop the belt and it's just kind of like,
2152040	2153880	both of the belts are just kind of like,
2153880	2156160	he's wearing them like a necklace.
2156160	2160520	I get down on my knees and look Keith right in the eyes.
2162120	2165880	Hey, hey buddy, hey me.
2165880	2169040	You're gonna do something real important right now
2169040	2171240	and I'm gonna help you feel up to it.
2171240	2175800	You're gonna distract that.
2175800	2179680	And I gesture to the 10 story tall thing
2179680	2182600	and I put my finger up his nose
2182600	2185040	and pull my thumb like a finger gun.
2187360	2190060	And then I slap him on the back and say, go.
2190060	2193880	An enormous amount of glass family cocaine
2193880	2198720	goes straight up into the dome of Silas Cole who hasn't.
2200120	2202200	I thought you knew of some secret Keith button
2202200	2205120	up your nose, that every Keith had.
2209240	2212720	Technically it's a, I know how to unlock the powers.
2212720	2215400	But no, you just like really dosed him
2215400	2216980	dangerously against his will.
2220680	2223200	The ethics of dosing yourself.
2225280	2228040	If any of these characters cared about ethics,
2228040	2230040	they would have died a long time ago.
2230040	2231280	Or would have just left.
2232200	2234240	Probably wouldn't have stolen all the stuff
2234240	2235880	from the green box.
2235880	2239300	Anyway, I slap him on the back and say, go get him buddy.
2239300	2241720	I start running towards the building.
2241720	2245360	So Keith and Keith begin running in opposite directions.
2245360	2246640	It is Clark Bishop's turn.
2246640	2249160	Clark thinks our Keith's got the right idea.
2249160	2250480	I think getting in that building
2250480	2253200	is at least we'll buy some time.
2253200	2258200	John Ball, I don't know if you can hear me.
2258320	2260540	Can you hear me?
2260580	2262980	We're going for the building.
2262980	2266140	You don't exactly hear it, but like the vibe,
2266140	2269700	something about the way the air feels around your head.
2269700	2272300	Answers in assurance.
2272300	2274220	It's not like you hear the word yes.
2274220	2275340	Oh shit.
2275340	2279300	You just feel that like John said yes.
2279300	2280260	That's dope.
2282140	2282980	It's fucking rad.
2282980	2284660	Grab your uncle, we gotta, let's go.
2284660	2286020	He's already heading there.
2286020	2286980	I'm already on my way.
2286980	2288420	You wanna take that line again?
2291220	2292260	Let's follow Don.
2299900	2301180	And it's Don's turn.
2301180	2304140	And Don hears Keith coming up behind him.
2308020	2310420	Am I still hearing the telephone in front of me?
2310420	2311240	Oh yeah.
2311240	2312780	Louder and louder with each step.
2312780	2314180	Zeroed in on the phone.
2314180	2317940	I pick up my pace if I wasn't already in like a full run.
2317940	2319220	I'm just hoofing it.
2319220	2320220	Can you hear it?
2321180	2323740	Talking as though everyone's with me.
2323740	2324860	Do you hear it, John?
2324860	2327580	John, John, can you hear it?
2327580	2330400	The air answers back yes, you feel that.
2330400	2334640	And you also just hear like, it's gonna be okay.
2334640	2337940	And Clark hears, I'm with you, run.
2337940	2340740	And Keith hears, you're on the right path.
2340740	2344020	But if you stop to look back, the ball hasn't moved.
2344020	2348300	The ball sinks down from where it's floating in the air.
2348300	2350580	And it almost seems to like sink
2350580	2352300	into the ground a little bit.
2352300	2357300	You can see weird currents and jolts from the air around it,
2357580	2360480	sort of like snapping into where the ball is.
2360480	2362560	And there's a strange ozone smell
2362560	2364660	and there's electricity around you.
2364660	2366860	And that's all you see right now.
2366860	2368400	Oh my God.
2369280	2371260	Holy shit, what's going on?
2371260	2372100	Yeah.
2375900	2378900	For those of you running toward the building,
2378900	2383900	suddenly you see a man bent over head and hands and stocks.
2384420	2388660	He's dressed like he is in the old West actually.
2388660	2392800	And fool has been branded into his forehead.
2392800	2395560	And as you're running toward him, you can hear him.
2396420	2398060	He's just muttering to himself.
2398060	2402220	We was made a real good running at him.
2402220	2404240	I was getting evicted soon.
2404240	2406660	Too much damn hesitation.
2406660	2410300	And as he's saying hesitation, he looks up
2410300	2412940	and sees what's happening in the distance
2412940	2414180	for the first time.
2414180	2416100	And he just stops cold.
2416100	2421100	And you all hear a slight chant song,
2421180	2423780	reverberating from the other side
2423780	2426660	of this towering dark buildings.
2426660	2428580	And the first time you've gotten close enough
2428580	2431500	to hear behind this building,
2431500	2436060	the power of these voices, a chorus hits you
2436060	2439200	like the sound of cascading waters
2439200	2443300	and like the rumbling of loud thunder.
2445100	2449180	Shock tea for leecha, shock tea for leecha,
2449180	2453060	shock tea for leecha, shock tea for leecha,
2453160	2457080	shock tea for leecha, shock tea for leecha,
2457080	2460440	shock tea for leecha, for the overseer.
2460440	2463040	Shock tea for leecha.
2463040	2466540	For the overseer, shock tea for leecha,
2466540	2470320	For the overseer, shock tea for leecha,
2470320	2475740	For the overseer, shock tea for leecha.
2475740	2478300	And Clark, you recognize this sound.
2478300	2479800	My theme song.
2479800	2481620	That's right.
2483180	2486180	It's the music that plays at the end of Wheel of Fortune.
2489540	2490820	Wait, really?
2490820	2494940	Is the Wheel of Fortune end song a banger?
2494940	2497140	Yes, it 100 million percent is.
2497140	2498060	Yes, it is.
2498060	2499020	I'll have to check that out.
2499020	2501300	I'll have that to a few playlists.
2501300	2503100	Fun dance times, number three.
2503100	2506300	Intimate home moments.
2506300	2508500	Wheel of Fortune end theme.
2508500	2512940	And this huge mass of people
2512940	2516220	begins walking in a circle
2516220	2518020	from around one side of the building.
2518020	2521200	You see two circles of people,
2521200	2523440	a bigger circle and an inner circle,
2523440	2525460	the outer circle going clockwise,
2525460	2528620	the inner circle moving counterclockwise
2528620	2530340	as they're chanting this song.
2530340	2533540	And you recognize there's a bunch of people dressed
2533540	2536760	like they're from the Old West in old timey clothing.
2537600	2542600	Some of them have friend branded across their foreheads.
2542640	2546160	And every single person who is in either the inner
2546160	2549440	or outer circle chanting this song,
2550640	2552800	they're all holding an animal
2552800	2555620	or have an animal right alongside them.
2555620	2557620	So with some of these Old West people,
2557620	2559400	you see a guy who looks like a bartender,
2559400	2561160	a guy who looks like a piano player,
2561160	2564640	a guy who looks like a gambler named Thomas.
2564640	2568480	They're each holding a raccoon, a chunky kitty,
2568480	2570480	and a handsome black dog.
2570480	2572760	The Critter Coalition.
2572760	2574900	You see Everett Pace,
2574900	2578120	and he's got a friendly woodpecker named Wilson
2578120	2579520	on one of his shoulders.
2581860	2583380	You see Jack Pearlman.
2585680	2586520	Thank you.
2591120	2595440	He's got an old, chunky, proud chipmunk on his shoulder
2595440	2596680	named Chip Montgomery.
2596680	2598640	You see Professor Horace Green,
2598640	2599760	who doesn't have an animal.
2599760	2602160	He has the decapitated head of Preacher Sheriff
