0	5000	Garbage in the morning, garbage in the evening, garbage at suppertime.
5000	9800	When garbage is on a bagel, you can eat garbage anytime.
9800	16720	Welcome my trash bags, it's your dumpster diving daddy, Wolf the dog, and we are broadcasting
16720	21240	live from 694.2 PTBP.
21240	26480	And I am here to eat y'all, because that's just what I do.
26480	28920	Feast on dumpster meats.
28920	33440	Heck, it ain't even gotta have meat in it for me to chow down.
33440	38920	You ever had a waffle that's been soaking in that sinful syrup that collects in the
38920	42560	bottom of an industrial trash compactor?
42560	46040	Five star yelp review every time, baby.
46040	52760	Speaking of hot syrupy trash, this week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Anissa, aka
52760	60240	ripsawunderdashunicorn, who tweeted about this show and tagged at Pretendin' Pod.
60240	62400	They write, Dear Wolf,
62400	68760	The other day I drove by a steakhouse and saw a crow dipping the french fry in the dumpster
68760	69760	juices.
69760	75080	I couldn't help but think of you, a true creature of culinary sophistication.
75080	79640	Also, I'd like to give my best buddy Mandy a shoutout.
79640	81280	Keep on kickin' ass.
81280	87200	Ah, yes, the finest gourmands, my flyin' rat friends.
87200	90440	Fried roots dipped in a dumpster au jus.
90440	93040	I'll have what he's havin'.
93040	98880	I remember my first serving of that at the Outback Steakhouse, which was just a dumpster
98880	101160	outback of a steakhouse.
101160	106680	I also love the bloomin' onion, which is just when an onion has been sittin' around for
106680	110160	way too long and gets real nasty.
110160	114520	Wolf the dog kinda nasty.
114520	120440	You wanna send your old Wolfie or your best buddy Mandy a message here on 694.2?
120440	123720	Talk about pretending to be people on the internet.
123720	130680	At Pretendin' Pod on Instagram and Twitter, a 5-star review on iTunes also totally works.
130680	135020	If you wanna support the show, but you can't stand the thought of other people finding
135020	137240	out you love this trash.
137240	142520	We'll keep your secret over at patreon.com slash pretendin' pod.
142520	149040	When fake cops in city blues with a few screws loose choose to snooze on clues, I can both
149040	151200	amuse and accuse.
151200	153120	It's the news.
153120	158800	Leon's got the numbers in him, and he is dead set on tearin' up the dance floor.
158800	162840	This gave the gang plenty of time to look over everything on the laptop.
162840	169320	Instead, they read a few screenshots that were saved on the desktop and called it good.
169320	174360	The two videos also saved on the desktop, one of which showing a thumbnail of Harriet
174360	177360	Marks, the student who seemingly caused all this?
177360	181640	Nah, they good, no thanks, no need to watch those.
181640	185640	Too busy textin' the same person from two different phones.
185640	191940	Now don't get me wrong, I love these fuckin' dumb-dumbs, but sometimes you just have to
191940	197820	take a deep breath and focus on kudzu with no backbone.
221940	229100	But, like, doesn't that depend on the family member?
229100	233300	Do you have no one in your family, no cousin, like, who's younger than you or something?
233300	235380	Or you could be like, yeah, bukkake, this is what I'm-
235380	238180	Thomas is always trying to get the younger generations hooked on bukkake.
238180	244100	No, no, I'm trying, I'm, uh, opposite, I'm steering them away from bukkake.
244100	246940	If they know what it is, they'll know how to not see it.
246940	248940	I've been burned in the past.
248940	252940	All of my younger cousins are, like, six years old.
252940	254940	Oh, fuck.
254940	256940	Jesus Christ.
256940	261940	So in fact, they grew up in a bad area, so yes.
261940	264940	Are you the youngest, like, youngest period?
264940	266940	That is how it happens, Justin.
266940	269940	Other than me, my sister is the youngest over-
269940	271940	What did you say when your sister said, Luke, what is bukkake?
271940	275940	Well, my sister knows what bukkake is.
275940	277940	Yeah, she does.
279940	285940	Literally, before the sentence even left my mouth, I'm like, oh, goddammit.
285940	288940	Do you care to elaborate on that sentence that came out of your mouth?
288940	292940	One time on this podcast, I said, call my mama bitch, so I understand.
292940	296940	And I kept it, just like I'm keeping all of this.
296940	299940	Well, good thing my sister doesn't listen to this shit.
299940	304940	But we can say hello to Luke's dad, who is up to episode 14 as of recording.
304940	306940	18, I think, right?
306940	314940	Well, yeah, 18, because his theory was that the little girl that died in the fiery car crash was Contingent's savior.
314940	316940	Well said.
316940	318940	Which I thought should be canon.
318940	322940	Yeah, absolutely. But if you make it this far, welcome-
323940	325940	To the lab!
326940	330940	Before we start this episode, I think we should talk out of character.
330940	332940	Luke, say what you said again about bukkake.
333940	336940	I think that it's really helped my skin out.
341940	342940	It would, right?
342940	344940	I haven't had acne in a long time.
345940	348940	Also, I make some extra money on the side, so it's kind of win-win.
348940	349940	Gotta buy a lot of towels.
349940	350940	Because people cum on my face.
350940	352940	Okay, yeah, there it is.
354940	356940	And they pay you for that, seemingly.
356940	359940	Well, I mean, we make royalty money.
359940	362940	Like, from the king and queen, or Prince Andrew specifically?
362940	365940	No, the king of queens.
367940	369940	Hey, Kevin can wait. I just want to think that we should all-
369940	370940	Kevin can wait.
370940	371940	Leah Remini?
372940	374940	Alright, so if we could all go clear for a second here.
374940	375940	She was the real boss on that show.
375940	376940	I got the joke, it was good.
376940	377940	Thank you.
377940	379940	Let's talk out of character about what's happening.
379940	382940	I don't really, honestly, know.
382940	383940	Same.
383940	385940	I know, people, and it-
385940	388940	It feels like deliberately I know what's going on.
388940	389940	Let's take that again.
389940	392940	No, no, no, it feels deliberately humiliating when Zach was like,
392940	394940	yeah, listeners know what's going on.
394940	395940	That was a little deliberate.
395940	398940	And I feel bad, over the past week, obviously,
398940	400940	I've felt pretty bad about doing that.
400940	402940	So this time, I'm just going to say-
402940	404940	That you made it all up and no one knows what's going on?
404940	405940	Not even you?
405940	406940	I know that you-
408940	409940	I know you just make it up.
409940	413940	No, those people who came into the studio last week,
413940	414940	they weren't real.
414940	416940	I know, I played one.
416940	417940	Wait, what?
417940	420940	Afterwards, Joe totally conned one.
420940	423940	He was like, hey, if you give me $50,
423940	425940	I'll give you $200 in three weeks.
425940	427940	Oh, those people.
427940	429940	There was that one guy that talked like an old man,
429940	431940	but he didn't look that old?
431940	432940	There you go, you got me.
432940	434940	Yeah, that was the one that you played.
434940	435940	Right.
435940	437940	How did you play him after he left?
437940	438940	How did you play him?
438940	440940	What do you mean, how did I play him?
440940	441940	Joe played his guy.
441940	444940	How did you play the one dude who walked out,
444940	445940	your dude?
445940	447940	Now I get the joke you're making.
447940	449940	How did you play the old man?
449940	452940	Did you call him acting like his son and say,
452940	453940	hey, I'm in prison.
453940	455940	I need you to wire me money.
455940	456940	Oh, my God.
456940	457940	That's exactly what I did.
457940	458940	That happened to my grandma.
458940	459940	That happened to my grandma.
459940	460940	I was sitting in high school.
460940	461940	What?
461940	462940	This is not a joke.
462940	464940	This is actually a solid story.
464940	466940	I'm sitting in high school English class
466940	468940	and my cell phone is ringing incessantly
468940	469940	and I'm like, what the fuck?
469940	470940	I keep looking.
470940	472940	It's my dad.
472940	474940	The third phone call, I looked at my teacher
474940	475940	and I was like, hey, my dad's calling.
475940	477940	My grandma probably died.
477940	479940	And she was like, hell yeah.
479940	480940	Yes.
480940	481940	Because you just sucked in high school.
481940	483940	Yes, and still.
483940	485940	And so I go out in the hallway
485940	486940	and I answer the phone call
486940	488940	and my dad's like, where are you?
488940	490940	I'm like, I'm at school.
490940	491940	And he's like, don't lie to me, Zach.
491940	493940	Where are you?
493940	494940	I'm in English class.
494940	496940	I can put you on the phone with my teacher
496940	497940	if you want.
497940	498940	And I'm like, I was a good kid.
498940	499940	My parents trusted me.
499940	500940	Where were you actually though?
500940	501940	I was in English class.
501940	503940	I was gone in my grandma in Philadelphia.
503940	505940	Skipping a candlelight vigil
505940	508940	and drinking with a homeless person.
508940	509940	Arrestees.
509940	512940	So he then proceeds to tell me
512940	514940	that my grandma got a phone call
514940	516940	from someone who sounded enough like me
516940	519940	to trick her into almost wiring
519940	522940	$1,000 as my bail.
522940	525940	And he called me thinking that I was in jail.
525940	527940	And I was like, dad, how old were you?
527940	528940	Would they give me my cell phone?
528940	529940	I was a senior in high school.
529940	531940	The same thing happened to my grandma.
531940	532940	Tell the same story.
532940	533940	Well, it's a little different.
533940	535940	Different enough to be interesting.
535940	537940	That's what's important, baby.
537940	539940	I was traveling.
539940	541940	I was in Boston for two weeks
541940	544940	house-sitting for a relative.
544940	547940	My grandma vaguely knew that I was traveling.
547940	549940	But she got a call from somebody who was just like,
549940	551940	hello, grandma?
551940	553940	And she was like, yeah?
553940	556940	And he was like, I'm in Philadelphia
556940	559940	and I need $300 or whatever.
559940	561940	And she was like, oh, okay.
561940	564940	And anyway, she knew it was weird enough
564940	565940	to talk about it.
565940	566940	She called me.
566940	567940	Weird enough to talk about.
567940	569940	Yeah, she knew it was weird enough to talk about.
569940	571940	She was like, if I saw something,
571940	572940	I'm going to say something.
572940	574940	And she did.
574940	576940	Thankfully, my grandma wasn't scammed.
576940	579940	But now I know every time I talk to my grandma
579940	583940	on the phone now, I'm like, grandma, it's me.
583940	584940	You say your middle name?
584940	587940	I say my middle name, which is embarrassing.
587940	589940	And also vagina.
590940	592940	No relation.
592940	594940	No relation.
594940	595940	No what?
595940	598940	Thomas Vagina Cox.
598940	601940	No relation.
601940	602940	Wait, don't dox me.
602940	603940	Fuck you.
603940	604940	Have we said our last names?
604940	605940	Probably.
605940	606940	Yeah.
606940	609940	Okay, I'm Thomas Cox and I'm proud of you.
609940	613940	So outside of me saying that you guys are dumb.
613940	614940	No, no, no.
614940	616940	Don't include my last name in that
616940	619940	in case somebody actually does then try to dox my grandma.
620940	622940	And her name is, what is her full name?
627940	630940	You will obviously bleep that one.
630940	631940	Yeah, but that's it.
631940	633940	Also, if you give me her phone number,
633940	635940	I need to give her a call.
637940	639940	Grandma, it's Luke.
639940	641940	I mean, Thomas.
641940	642940	Thomas Vagina Cox.
642940	643940	Thomas Vagina Cox.
643940	645940	I'm in a lot of trouble.
645940	646940	A lot of relation.
646940	647940	You're my grandma.
647940	649940	Do you know what bukkake is?
651940	653940	She said, she said,
653940	656940	yeah, it saved me a lot of money on facial care.
656940	659940	My grandma knows what bukkake is.
659940	662940	Don't treat her like some kind of ignorant.
662940	663940	How do we recover from that?
663940	666940	Well, I'd just like to shout out my grandfather who
666940	668940	got your grandma into bukkake.
668940	669940	My God.
669940	671940	There's a place to cut in there somewhere.
671940	673940	There's gotta be, right?
673940	674940	Yeah.
674940	677940	It's just gonna be like cut and paste it together words
677940	678940	like a serial killer.
678940	682940	Like, I think that show is good.
682940	687940	Well, I was gonna say I have theories of what is going on.
687940	688940	Oh, how many?
688940	689940	Like two.
689940	690940	Two.
690940	693940	And the more I think about both of them,
693940	696940	I start poking holes in my theories.
696940	697940	You floated one.
697940	698940	So I don't think, but yeah,
698940	700940	we talked about this last week.
700940	703940	We were driving home last week and you floated the idea
703940	706940	that maybe people killing themselves is their goal.
706940	709940	Like us offing people is maybe-
709940	710940	Counter productive.
710940	711940	Counter productive.
711940	712940	That it's helping them achieve whatever goal
712940	714940	that they're trying to.
714940	716940	I think, I don't know if it was on the podcast
716940	718940	or just in conversation with you,
718940	722940	but talking about how when, because like when people chant
722940	725940	in most like Delta green things,
725940	727940	it's typically something bad.
727940	730940	Chant that for the listeners just to get the words out
730940	732940	as broadly as possible, Zach.
732940	734940	Tawil Alakol.
734940	736940	Tawil Alakol.
736940	737940	I punch him.
739940	741940	Yeah, I'm gonna roll.
742940	743940	Yeah, Zach.
743940	744940	40 on a 70, I shoot you in the face.
744940	746940	We rolled unarmed combat against you
746940	748940	and we kicked your ass.
748940	749940	But no, I was saying like,
749940	752940	usually I hear a chant like that and I'm like,
752940	753940	okay, if something's about to be summoned,
753940	755940	it's gonna hurt us, it's gonna be bad.
755940	756940	Let's stop it.
756940	760940	But so far when the chanting has happened,
760940	762940	it's just been people killing themselves.
762940	764940	That's another thing,
764940	766940	is that we haven't actually killed either one.
766940	767940	We've heard two, right?
767940	769940	We've heard the guy in the mall, the Santa mall,
769940	772940	and then we've heard your brother's partner, Bruce Robin.
772940	773940	We killed Santa, right?
773940	775940	We shot him, but he impaled his own head.
775940	777940	I shot him, he didn't die and he killed himself
777940	779940	and then everybody else that we didn't kill
779940	781940	started killing themselves.
781940	782940	Enchanting.
782940	783940	Enchanting, yeah.
783940	785940	Everyone in that room was chanting.
785940	786940	Did they start chanting after he killed himself?
786940	787940	Enchantment, yes they did.
787940	789940	Right around the time that he killed himself.
789940	791940	And Bruce Robin started chanting that
791940	794940	and I think we shot him and beat him up
794940	796940	and then he killed himself.
796940	798940	We didn't get a shot in on him.
798940	799940	He punched him.
799940	800940	Somebody shot him in the gut.
800940	801940	I shot him in the gut.
801940	802940	Oh, did you really?
802940	803940	One of us did.
803940	804940	Somebody did.
804940	805940	Probably Keith.
805940	806940	But yeah, he shot himself.
806940	807940	He killed himself.
807940	808940	In the heat of the moment,
808940	810940	who knows who shot who in the gut.
810940	814940	But yeah, so my theory now is maybe next time
814940	815940	it starts happening,
815940	818940	could it be some sort of protection spell
818940	821940	or I don't know, I don't know if it's like something
821940	824940	that's like, I don't think it's a bad thing.
824940	826940	I think my initial thought is,
826940	830940	oh, it's gonna summon an elder god demon thing,
830940	832940	but I don't think that's the case anymore.
832940	833940	Well, okay, but what we were just saying,
833940	835940	the path we were kind of heading down just now
835940	837940	was that when you do the taui ala coal,
837940	841940	that if you kill yourself then, it then spreads, right?
841940	844940	In that kind of way we just stumbled on
844940	845940	as we were talking.
845940	846940	Or if you're killed maybe.
846940	848940	Well, after Bruce Robin killed himself,
848940	852940	we blacked out, woke up naked writing numbers in blood.
852940	855940	And who's to say that we weren't chanting that
855940	856940	while we did it?
856940	857940	Because we don't know.
857940	859940	I don't remember doing that.
859940	862940	When the audience, when they started chanting,
862940	865940	did they start then doing numbers also
865940	867940	or were they just chanting?
867940	868940	They were just chanting at the end,
868940	872940	but they were like all mumbling to themselves
872940	873940	throughout the process.
873940	876940	And you had the one guy mopping numbers
876940	878940	onto the ground with paint.
878940	879940	And he was naked.
879940	881940	Well, and then you also got to remember
881940	883940	throughout the entire campus of CSU,
883940	887940	numbers everywhere written all over everything.
887940	890940	And why is the fucker who's with us immune to it?
890940	891940	That's a good question.
891940	893940	As we all look at Justin.
893940	895940	I don't know.
895940	896940	He really doesn't.
896940	897940	I don't know.
897940	899940	That'd be fucked up if I was like,
899940	900940	well, Zach told me.
900940	901940	Here's why.
901940	904940	Zach told me not to tell you guys this, but.
904940	906940	It's because, what is your name?
906940	907940	Donovan West Haven.
907940	908940	Haven.
908940	913940	He uses Roman numerals, not Arabic numerals.
913940	915940	And so he's not affected.
915940	917940	That doesn't sound right.
917940	918940	Numerals?
918940	920940	Donovan, yeah.
920940	921940	Numbers?
921940	923940	Roman numerals, right?
923940	924940	Well, but people are.
924940	925940	Roman numbers?
925940	926940	Yeah.
926940	927940	They're Roman numbers?
927940	930940	Luke, they're called Roman numbers.
930940	931940	You idiot.
931940	934940	Did you think it was Roman numerals?
934940	935940	Roman numbers.
935940	938940	You guys can gaslight me way too easily.
938940	939940	Clearly not.
939940	941940	No, we can't.
941940	944940	Luke is like, oh yeah, right, right.
944940	945940	Roman numbers.
945940	946940	Roman numbers, yeah.
946940	949940	I was like, man, I must have made that word up.
949940	950940	I'm like, fuck you.
950940	951940	No, I didn't.
951940	952940	All right.
952940	953940	What else?
953940	955940	Any other theories of what the hell?
955940	957940	Because you guys are so stupid.
957940	958940	What else?
958940	961940	Any other theories of what the hell could be possibly going on?
961940	966940	The other theory that we've been kind of operating under is that it transfers like in a chain-like
966940	967940	fashion.
967940	968940	Right.
968940	972940	I think I said this last episode was my initial thought was, you know, Harriet Marks died
972940	978940	and then Bruce Robin is saying her name and then Bruce Robin dies and we're saying numbers
978940	980940	that translate to his name.
980940	983940	You know what we never looked into is his connection to her.
983940	984940	Do we know that?
984940	987940	I don't think we have, we haven't looked into it.
987940	989940	How did Bruce get infected, yeah?
989940	993940	I don't think we've looked into it, but I also, I couldn't tell you the first step in
993940	994940	doing that.
994940	996940	And the name Bruce Robin was writing was?
996940	997940	Harriet Marks.
997940	998940	But then Leon.
998940	1000940	A powerful businessman.
1000940	1006940	But then Leon was reciting numbers that translate to Ben Smith, who was the muscular manny,
1006940	1007940	Santa guy, right?
1007940	1010940	No, well, he was just the one who was doing squats on Santa's throne.
1010940	1012940	He wasn't one of the like hot Santas.
1012940	1014940	He was the first person that I shot.
1014940	1015940	Yes.
1015940	1019940	That was, uh, started chanting tall will Alec Cole or whatever.
1019940	1020940	Yeah, there we go.
1020940	1023940	Do you have a question for me, Zach?
1023940	1024940	Oh, right.
1024940	1029940	So you guys were just talking about what, what is the connection between Harriet Marks
1029940	1030940	and Bruce Robin?
1030940	1031940	Right.
1031940	1038940	Well, so in Harriet Marks's desk, um, I found a to do list with two, just only two items
1038940	1039940	on it.
1040940	1042940	Investigate the most corrupt.
1042940	1050940	The first is research research, most unethical corporation in the city in the city to was
1050940	1052940	who is the overseer?
1052940	1058940	So Harriet was looking into, was Harriet involved with any, like, uh, was she involved with
1058940	1060940	the student paper or was she a journalism student?
1060940	1063940	She was more of a pro union activist.
1063940	1068940	So she was looking into the overseer, which may, well, she might not have been looking
1068940	1069940	into it.
1069940	1072940	She, she stumbled upon something that the overseer.
1072940	1074940	So she was like, I got to research what this is.
1074940	1076940	First is research.
1076940	1083940	The most unethical corporation in the city, which is, I assume surprisingly not unethical.
1083940	1084940	What is it?
1084940	1087940	B and R or what was bar Corp bar Corp.
1087940	1090940	I was thinking beans and Robin, but you got it.
1090940	1092940	Bar Corp beans and Robin.
1092940	1097940	I was thinking not a, she might've been killed by Bruce Robin.
1097940	1103940	If she was poking into, into the corporation, it's definitely how she met Bruce Robin.
1103940	1104940	I think.
1104940	1105940	I don't know if she got killed.
1105940	1106940	She killed herself.
1106940	1107940	Right.
1107940	1108940	We knew that too.
1108940	1109940	Yeah, she did.
1109940	1110940	Okay.
1110940	1111940	Which is a common theme of this whole thing.
1111940	1116940	So could she have, uh, she didn't, we found out she like fell out of a fell out of her
1116940	1117940	dorm window.
1117940	1118940	Was that it?
1118940	1121940	How'd she, how'd she kill herself from the pictures that you saw that were given to you
1121940	1124940	by Leon Simpson of the crime scene.
1124940	1126940	It seemed to be a gunshot wound.
1126940	1127940	Oh really?
1127940	1131940	There was a blood splatter behind on her a wall of her dorm.
1131940	1133940	So she, she killed herself by shooting herself.
1133940	1135940	Well now that's, that's a baby.
1135940	1137940	Bruce Robin shot himself.
1137940	1140940	I mean, I don't know if that was, if there's a link there.
1140940	1145940	Like, I mean, obviously Bruce had a gun on him and was trying to kill himself at it.
1145940	1150940	I don't know if there's a link there or if it just is circumstantial that they both shot
1150940	1151940	themselves.
1151940	1152940	Are we sure they're crime scene photos?
1152940	1154940	Of Harriet Marks?
1154940	1157940	We, we looked at, yeah, we, we looked at the crime scene photos.
1157940	1159940	What if Leon shot her and took photos?
1159940	1161940	Why would he have us investigated?
1161940	1162940	Bruce did, you mean?
1162940	1163940	What would that imply?
1163940	1164940	I don't know.
1164940	1166940	Figure it out.
1166940	1167940	I know.
1167940	1168940	Tell me.
1170940	1171940	Let's get into the game.
1171940	1172940	Yeah.
1172940	1176940	I think we've covered a lot here and we've got a lot of good things being brought to
1176940	1177940	the forefront.
1177940	1179940	I don't feel any more clear.
1179940	1182940	I'm only maybe a little bit more.
1182940	1187940	I feel like the listeners are only talking to us even more.
1187940	1188940	Yeah.
1188940	1192940	If you are one of the people that supposedly know what's going on, hit me up.
1192940	1193940	Hit me up.
1193940	1194940	Tell me what's going on.
1194940	1195940	Fuck you.
1195940	1196940	Fuck you.
1196940	1197940	Fuck you.
1197940	1198940	Okay.
1198940	1206940	As you guys come back to this place where you're all standing there, you were standing
1206940	1213940	around, Clark was looking at his phones and you would all know that the things that you
1213940	1219940	have not looked at that you've come across since this epidemic has ended are the two
1219940	1223940	videos on the laptop that Amelia Locke was throwing in the air.
1223940	1224940	Fuck you guys.
1224940	1225940	I got it right that time.
1225940	1226940	Did you?
1226940	1228940	There are two videos that I honestly don't know.
1228940	1229940	Did you?
1229940	1231940	I think you did for the first time.
1231940	1232940	Think about it.
1232940	1233940	Really get in your head about it.
1233940	1234940	What would you like to do?
1234940	1235940	I want to go to the lab.
1235940	1236940	I want to go to the lab too.
1236940	1237940	Yeah.
1237940	1239940	Wanting that, John head stores the lab.
1239940	1241940	Donovan, we're going to the lab.
1241940	1243940	We're going to see if those people are still in there.
1243940	1244940	Can you lead the way?
1244940	1249940	I look at John as he's turning down a hallway that is the incorrect direction and just walking
1249940	1250940	with a lot of confidence.
1250940	1254940	I'm like, hey, we're going this way.
1254940	1259940	Life is a garden of forking paths, but they all lead to our ultimate destination.
1259940	1261940	If you want to go to the lab, though, we got to go this way.
1261940	1267940	I know, but John picks a beautiful flower out of a little pot that was in the hallway
1267940	1270940	that he walked down and then he heads back towards you.
1270940	1272940	Each petal has a different number written on it.
1272940	1274940	I was going to ask if it had a number on it.
1274940	1276940	He says, what does this mean?
1276940	1277940	And he hands it to you.
1277940	1278940	It's a plastic plant.
1278940	1279940	It's a fake indoor plant.
1279940	1280940	It's cheap.
1280940	1281940	Is it?
1281940	1283940	What are the numbers?
1283940	1285940	You have nothing.
1285940	1287940	It spells out flower.
1287940	1289940	You cheap.
1289940	1290940	You have nothing.
1290940	1293940	You're like, the flower has fucking numbers on it.
1293940	1294940	Fuck you.
1294940	1299940	I said, I said my news resolution.
1299940	1300940	I look at the flower.
1300940	1304940	I'm like, it's just a flower.
1304940	1306940	I picked it because it was beautiful.
1306940	1310940	And because I look at flower and I look at John, I'm like, we're wasting time here.
1310940	1313940	We there's people that have been in there for days.
1313940	1314940	Let's go.
1314940	1317940	John puts the flower in your ear and walks.
1317940	1319940	I feel a little bit prettier.
1319940	1322940	Clark is still carrying the laptop and he's holding it up as he walks along.
1322940	1323940	How are you holding it up?
1323940	1324940	It's open.
1324940	1325940	It's open?
1325940	1326940	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1326940	1327940	It's open.
1327940	1331940	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1331940	1333940	Okay, cool.
1333940	1338940	When you guys go out into the campus, you hear these screams and noises that you've
1338940	1341940	heard previously all throughout the campus.
1341940	1342940	It's college, baby.
1342940	1356940	Are we cops or are we fucking experts on youth music?
1356940	1357940	Come on.
1357940	1362940	If I look over towards the bell tower, is Shamwell Chameleon still up there?
1362940	1367940	Shamwell Chameleon is on top of the minion.
1367940	1369940	Shamwell Chameleon is on top of the minion.
1369940	1371940	The minion was on top of the bell tower?
1371940	1372940	Uh-huh, yeah.
1372940	1373940	Yeah.
1373940	1376940	Dude, hey, good for Shamwell, first of all.
1376940	1382940	And she's just up there and you can hear her in the distance screaming, I gotta get higher.
1382940	1383940	Higher.
1383940	1384940	Higher.
1384940	1389940	I look at these guys and I'm like, I think we did a good thing while I pointed her.
1389940	1394940	And you can see behind her in the distance, there are black unmarked helicopters coming
1394940	1395940	into the city.
1395940	1399940	Those are probably there for her because it went viral that she wanted to get higher.
1399940	1404940	I prod Donovan in the back and I'm like, hurry up, let's go.
1404940	1405940	Okay.
1405940	1406940	Pick up the pace.
1406940	1407940	Okay.
1407940	1409940	Donovan, there are two routes to get to the lab.
1409940	1410940	Mm-hmm.
1410940	1413940	One is more direct, but it is not lit and the other one is-
1413940	1416940	Is totally fucking awesome.
1416940	1423940	Honestly, this whole situation is not lit right now.
1423940	1424940	No, yeah.
1424940	1427940	None of this has been lit, Zach.
1427940	1428940	The other one is well lit.
1428940	1432940	The British person would say it's really cool.
1432940	1434940	It's well lit.
1434940	1436940	Which one do you want to, which one do you lead them down?
1436940	1440940	I think I'd lead them down whatever I feel is the safest because Donovan's feeling like
1440940	1444940	endangered now, especially after seeing the one person be like, turn the lights off.
1444940	1446940	He's like freaked out about that shit.
1446940	1448940	Is it the well lit one?
1448940	1452940	Oh, we're going to go down the proper lit one.
1452940	1455940	So you guys don't go down the proper lit one.
1455940	1456940	Well lit.
1456940	1461940	It's lit by street lights, the tall lights that light paths and he's going to stop under
1461940	1464940	one and just stare up at it for a minute or two.
1464940	1466940	How lit is a street light?
1466940	1467940	That's pretty pedestrian.
1467940	1471940	Keith comes up next to you and looks up and I'm like, remember Harry Potter?
1471940	1472940	That thing?
1472940	1473940	Anyway.
1473940	1474940	De-luminator?
1474940	1475940	De-luminator.
1475940	1476940	That thing's awful.
1476940	1478940	Good thing we don't have one because I would have clicked it a bunch of times.
1478940	1479940	Anyway.
1479940	1480940	That would have been terrible.
1480940	1483940	It would have been a terrible moment in a podcast for sure.
1483940	1484940	Got him.
1485940	1487940	Fucking Ben Dan.
1487940	1489940	And you hear down this path.
1507940	1509940	It's channel of the day guys.
1509940	1513940	And as you guys are walking in that direction, it's getting louder and louder and you can
1513940	1519940	kind of hear that it's coming from this bench that is just around a corner.
1519940	1521940	You can only see the edge of the bench.
1521940	1524940	You can't see the fullness of the bench.
1524940	1528940	It's like in an enclave of a building that's well lit but you just can't see around the
1528940	1529940	corner.
1529940	1530940	It's tight.
1530940	1531940	But you can't see it.
1531940	1533940	What do you mean we can't tell what kind of bench it is?
1533940	1535940	No, I mean the bench is like hidden.
1535940	1538940	You can see the corner of a bench but you can't see the full bench because you haven't
1538940	1539940	gotten that far yet.
1539940	1541940	The cleaning lady comes in on Monday.
1541940	1542940	Is it around?
1542940	1544940	How much more bench could there be?
1544940	1545940	She sweeps.
1545940	1547940	Is it around the building we're going to?
1547940	1549940	No, there's just a building on the way.
1549940	1551940	I prod Donovan in the back.
1551940	1552940	I'm like, okay, really hurry up.
1552940	1553940	Let's go.
1553940	1555940	Donovan starts kind of rearing back a little bit.
1555940	1557940	Are we like super close to this?
1557940	1559940	Yeah, you're probably like 20 feet away.
1559940	1560940	It's coming up hot.
1560940	1564940	Should someone go ahead and see what this is all about?
1564940	1568940	Donovan, you've seen, think about what we just left.
1568940	1571940	Do you really want to go check out that sound?
1572940	1580940	Okay, it's straight ahead, but you guys, I'll walk behind you guys and guide you.
1580940	1581940	That doesn't make any sense.
1581940	1582940	Just go.
1582940	1583940	Just keep going straight.
1583940	1585940	I'll be behind you for sure.
1585940	1587940	I push Donovan along.
1587940	1591940	While your path may not be apparent.
1591940	1593940	Clark, I need you to help.
1593940	1594940	I'm pushing you through this.
1594940	1595940	Clark, you know me, please.
1595940	1597940	Don't make me go ahead.
1597940	1598940	Sure, sure, Donovan.
1598940	1599940	Of course.
1600940	1602940	I guess if he nears the bench, he's going to say hello.
1602940	1608940	And as you near the bench and say hello, turning the corner, you see there's an old man who
1608940	1616940	is huddled into the corner of this enclave of this building and he's crouched over and
1616940	1621940	he's got his left hand out and he's holding a citrus peeler in his other hand.
1621940	1628940	And he's slowly dragging the peeler down each of his fingers and moaning as the skin comes
1629940	1631940	off like a lime zest.
1631940	1633940	Fuck off, Zach.
1635940	1638940	Roll sanity, Joe.
1638940	1639940	Oh, fuck.
1639940	1640940	See you, boys.
1642940	1643940	I fail.
1643940	1644940	Roll a D4.
1644940	1645940	Oh my God.
1645940	1649940	So I had two sanity points and I rolled a one.
1649940	1650940	So I've got one sanity.
1650940	1651940	Okay.
1651940	1652940	You're clinging on.
1652940	1653940	You're fine.
1653940	1654940	I join him.
1659940	1661940	That sounds way more rational than anything.
1661940	1663940	There is actually a light coming down on him.
1663940	1665940	I get up real close to him.
1665940	1667940	He found a nice little spot here, it looks like.
1671940	1675940	And he's just turning his fingers into those of a skeleton.
1675940	1678940	I go up and I kick him in the shin.
1678940	1679940	Okay.
1679940	1682940	Roll sanity when you turn the corner and see what's happening here.
1682940	1684940	I pass 24 on 26.
1684940	1685940	Wow.
1685940	1687940	Oh no, I have 23.
1687940	1689940	I fail 24 on 23.
1689940	1691940	Oh, fuck.
1691940	1693940	I thought I had 23.
1693940	1694940	That sucked.
1694940	1695940	So yeah, I fail.
1695940	1696940	Okay.
1696940	1697940	Sounds good.
1697940	1700940	I need you to leave the room.
1700940	1702940	Get the fuck out of here.
1702940	1706940	You're not welcome to hear this next part.
1706940	1707940	Bye bye.
1718940	1726940	John Lee Pettymore and Donovan Westhaven, you see Keith Vigna turn the corner where
1726940	1732940	Clark has disappeared to and then Keith Vigna immediately turns around and comes walking
1732940	1736940	back and he is repeating the numbers for Bruce Robin.
1736940	1740940	I grab Donovan by the chest, or by his shoulders, and I'm like, let him go.
1740940	1742940	There's nothing you can do for him.
1742940	1743940	For who?
1743940	1744940	Him.
1744940	1746940	Okay, I wasn't going to do it.
1746940	1747940	Don't.
1747940	1748940	I wasn't going to do anything.
1748940	1749940	But don't.
1749940	1751940	What the fuck is happening right now?
1751940	1758940	Clark is going to yell from the alcove, hey, uh, you fellas, this is, uh, you know, Donovan
1758940	1760940	especially, you're not going to want to see what's going on over here.
1760940	1763940	I just, uh, just put up the blinders and keep walking.
1763940	1764940	Okay.
1764940	1765940	Okay, Clark.
1765940	1766940	Thank you.
1766940	1768940	Do you join them to continue down this path?
1768940	1769940	No, I'm going to linger here for a second.
1769940	1773940	And I want to say to the man, why are you, why are you doing that?
1773940	1779940	Oh yeah, feels good.
1779940	1781940	Are there any numbers around him?
1781940	1782940	Oh yeah.
1782940	1784940	Can I discern any words that I would know?
1784940	1786940	He's writing in blood.
1786940	1795940	Clark would see the numbers four, one, one, four, eight, five, one, one, eight, two, zero,
1795940	1797940	written all around him.
1797940	1803940	Oh, got to become bone.
1803940	1805940	Yeah.
1805940	1808940	Keith's always the one who's good at doing the numbers.
1808940	1811940	Uh, so if they're just single integers, it doesn't spell anything.
1811940	1815940	It's D A A D H E A A H B.
1815940	1819940	And then I don't know what zero is, but then if, hold on, let me see the numbers.
1819940	1822940	Four eleven, I could be, I guess it's 20.
1822940	1829940	So it might be four, one, 14, eight, five, 11, eight, 20.
1829940	1830940	It's my guess.
1830940	1831940	Let me write down the numbers.
1831940	1832940	Okay.
1832940	1833940	We're not recording.
1833940	1834940	Okay.
1834940	1835940	We are.
1835940	1836940	That's fun.
1836940	1837940	People like this.
1837940	1838940	Four, one, one, four.
1838940	1841940	You don't have to say that cause I edit the podcast.
1841940	1842940	Eight, five.
1842940	1843940	People like this.
1843940	1845940	Four, one, one, four, eight, five.
1845940	1847940	Eleven, eight, two, zero.
1847940	1849940	Eight, two, zero.
1849940	1851940	Uh, I figured out the numbers.
1851940	1853940	Actually, I'm not talking to anybody.
1853940	1854940	I figured out the numbers.
1854940	1856940	Uh, it spells Dan Hart.
1856940	1858940	D A N H E A R T.
1858940	1860940	I want to say that name to him.
1860940	1861940	Oh.
1861940	1863940	Does that mean anything to you, sir?
1863940	1865940	Co worker.
1865940	1867940	Oh yeah.
1867940	1870940	Do you work at a bar corp?
1870940	1871940	No.
1871940	1876940	And he's wearing like a CSU janitorial uniform.
1876940	1877940	Dan Hart was a coworker.
1877940	1878940	Oh yeah.
1878940	1879940	Oh yeah.
1879940	1885240	And he's just like peeling and just the thinnest layer of old man paper thin skin is coming
1885240	1886940	off each finger as he does it.
1886940	1887940	Is it dead skin?
1887940	1888940	No.
1888940	1889940	Damn it.
1889940	1890940	Did Dan die?
1890940	1891940	Yeah.
1891940	1892940	How'd he die?
1892940	1893940	Oh God.
1893940	1894940	Yeah.
1894940	1900060	And he finishes and it just, the skin hits the ground and he looks up at you and looks
1900060	1905940	dead in your eyes and he says, hung himself in front of me.
1905940	1906940	Oh yeah.
1906940	1907940	How long ago?
1907940	1909940	Oh no time.
1909940	1910940	Well that's true.
1910940	1911940	Agreed.
1911940	1912940	Oh yeah.
1912940	1913940	Oh there it is.
1913940	1914940	That's the good stuff.
1914940	1919300	Well you have a fun night.
1919300	1921260	Carry on citizen.
1921260	1927580	And as you guys move through, Keith Vigna is coming with you if you'd bring him essentially.
1927580	1934020	This is the first time I think that Clark has been, has witnessed one of the crew doing
1934020	1935060	this.
1935060	1937420	So he wants to turn around on Keith.
1937420	1938420	Keith.
1938420	1939420	Keith.
1939420	1940420	Nothing.
1940420	1941420	He's just mumbling these.
1941420	1942420	I'm going to smack him.
1942420	1943420	Doesn't even face him.
1943420	1944420	John.
1944420	1945420	Yeah.
1945420	1946880	Like John moves to stop his hand as he goes to smack him.
1946880	1949420	He gets through because he already did it.
1949420	1955340	But John moves to stop it and he's like, do not disturb the traveler in his moment of
1955340	1957260	passage.
1957260	1958260	The traveler.
1958260	1959420	Is he the...
1959420	1960420	You are the traveler.
1960420	1961420	I thought he was.
1961420	1963420	I don't understand, John.
1963420	1964420	Keith.
1964420	1966420	Wake up, dammit.
1966420	1972140	I turned to Donovan, Donovan, is this, is this what we were like?
1972140	1977140	Leon was on the floor, but yeah, you guys were just mumbling, mumbling numbers.
1977140	1978140	You're unresponsive.
1978140	1979140	Do you remember?
1979140	1980820	Keith tried to shake you and nothing happened.
1980820	1983180	Do you remember how long we were like that?
1983180	1984180	Couple minutes maybe.
1984180	1987900	All right, then I'm just going to have to hope that Keith snaps out of it in a couple
1987900	1988900	minutes, I suppose.
1988900	1989900	Yeah.
1989900	1992300	All right, let's just continue on then if he's going to follow.
1992300	1995340	Keith, just, just hold onto my shirt.
1995340	1996340	Does he?
1996340	1997340	Sure.
1997340	1998340	Sure.
1998340	2018820	And as you guys are nearing the glass hall, Keith comes to.
2018820	2024900	You guys are approaching glass hall and Keith's eyes kind of stop glazing over.
2024900	2025900	Keith.
2025900	2026900	Are you, are you with us?
2026900	2027900	Can you hear me?
2027900	2028900	Yeah.
2028900	2029900	Why wouldn't I be?
2029900	2030900	It was those numbers again.
2030900	2031900	They got you.
2031900	2032900	What?
2032900	2037460	Well, what was I, which numbers?
2037460	2038460	Which numbers was he doing?
2038460	2039460	Bruce Robin.
2039460	2041880	You were doing Bruce Robin's numbers.
2041880	2045860	Did I, I mean, I've seen you guys do this before.
2045860	2049300	Was I just saying them or what kind of stuff was I doing?
2049300	2050300	Like you're in a trance.
2050300	2053340	You're just saying the numbers and wouldn't respond to anything.
2053340	2055700	And I slapped Keith and it didn't work.
2055700	2062260	I rub my face and I think back to just minutes ago when I slapped his face, I'm like, I wouldn't
2062260	2063260	have done the same thing.
2063260	2064260	Clark.
2064260	2065260	I did do the same thing.
2065260	2069580	Have yourself a merry little Christmas.
2069580	2079060	Is this the start of Tyler, the creator's, let the needle shine in the light of the moon
2079060	2084180	until I put them in your eyes.
2084180	2085580	It is the start of Tyler.
2085580	2088460	I look at Clark's, what did I miss?
2088460	2089460	That's new.
2089460	2095900	And you hear from the entrance to glass hall, seemingly standing like right in front of
2095900	2096900	the entrance.
2096900	2105940	There is a college student dude who's dressed in like athletic shorts and slides and a t-shirt
2105940	2111940	even in all this snow or slides, the slip on slides are like the slip on sandals.
2111940	2114840	That's such a cool thing to call them.
2114840	2122460	And that guy is standing completely still in this pose with like his right fist up to
2122460	2127260	his cheek and then his left hand like flat and up in the air.
2127260	2128780	What would that pose be called?
2128780	2132060	It's like the Mr. Alice pose, right?
2132060	2135940	You're flexing on one side and the other side is a dab.
2135940	2136940	Yep.
2136940	2142940	Oh, Joe did it with the little mannequin in here.
2142940	2145220	We'll put that on Twitter.
2145220	2150740	He won't bend enough to do it, but dabbing with one arm.
2150740	2159780	And then, more importantly, there is a young boy in choir robes singing softly and methodically
2159780	2165420	sticking syringes into this dude who's just standing there.
2165420	2173180	And as he sings, he's putting a syringe directly into this guy's eye.
2173180	2175260	Come on, Zach.
2175260	2176260	You're off the podcast.
2176260	2177820	Get out of here.
2177820	2178820	Done.
2178820	2179820	It's our podcast now.
2179900	2185060	And it's fucking about just being friends and hanging out and being nice.
2185060	2186620	It's about being nice.
2186620	2188300	So get the fuck out of here, Zach.
2188300	2189580	Zach didn't make it happen.
2189580	2191900	He's just telling us what happened, guys.
2191900	2193900	No, no, Justin.
2193900	2194900	That's just a thing.
2194900	2196300	He's gaslighted you in the blue.
2196300	2197300	Zach propaganda.
2197300	2198300	Yes.
2198300	2199300	That's Zach-a-ganda.
2199300	2200300	Zach-a-ganda.
2200300	2205620	Wait, Zach, go home.
2205620	2206620	Quick question.
2206620	2208820	This is just in the lobby of Glass Hall?
2208820	2211540	This is right in front of the front door of Glass Hall?
2211540	2212540	Yes.
2212540	2213540	Outside.
2213540	2214540	Outside.
2214540	2218220	I'm imagining the look at me on the captain now, but instead of him pointing at his eyes,
2218220	2222540	it's just two syringes sticking out of his eyeballs.
2222540	2223940	You're welcome for that one.
2223940	2226140	Yeah, Luke should be the DM.
2226140	2230380	Look at me on the DM now.
2230380	2231380	I like playing.
2231380	2237100	I'm going to have everyone roll intelligence because you're all super fucked up right now,
2237100	2240820	but if you pass an intelligence check, you're going to have to roll sanity.
2240820	2242740	Hey, I failed.
2242740	2243740	Yay.
2243740	2245540	I crit pass with a 22.
2245540	2246540	Oh my God.
2246540	2247540	What does that mean?
2247540	2248540	I crit pass too.
2248540	2249540	No fucking way.
2249540	2252700	I got a 66 and yeah, my intelligence is 75.
2252700	2253700	Hell yeah.
2253700	2254700	What are the chances?
2254700	2256700	So you guys auto fail your sanity checks for sure.
2256700	2258300	My intelligence is not that high, but I...
2258300	2262020	Go ahead and roll that intelligence for Donovan there, Justin.
2262020	2263020	48.
2263020	2264020	I assume a failure.
2264020	2265020	That is a failure.
2265020	2266020	Oh really?
2266020	2267580	I'm dumb and I'm 55.
2267580	2268580	I'm dumb and I'm 50.
2268580	2269580	You're not.
2269580	2270580	You're even lower.
2270580	2271580	You guys aren't dumb.
2271580	2272580	Well, you are.
2272580	2273580	You played dumb.
2273580	2274580	He's a college student.
2274580	2275580	Come on.
2275580	2276580	He is a fifth year senior though.
2276580	2277580	The standards are higher.
2277580	2280340	He's a fifth year senior that has only online classes.
2280340	2285540	No, Donovan is like way too concerned with his own life to pay attention to it.
2285540	2289660	He like glanced up and was like, ah, it's probably fucked up and immediately went back
2289660	2292180	to his phone, which is what Justin just did.
2292180	2295740	Take a note.
2295740	2301340	So with Luke and Thomas crit succeeding on those intelligence checks, we'll call that
2301340	2309060	an automatic fail and I need an automatic fail on your sanity check that you would have
2309060	2310060	had to take.
2310060	2311340	But what knowledge do we claim?
2311340	2314740	Well, actually, no, I crit failed.
2314740	2317820	I'm just kidding.
2317820	2336220	So I'm going to have the two of you leave the room.
2336220	2338700	Clark Bishop, Donovan West Haven.
2338700	2339700	Yes.
2339700	2340700	Nailed it.
2340700	2341700	First try.
2341700	2342700	So proud of you.
2342700	2347500	The two of you notice as soon as this awful vision is approached.
2347500	2353580	You see that Keith Vigna and John Lee Pattymore immediately go into themselves and begin chanting
2353580	2355500	the numbers of Bruce Robin.
2355500	2358180	God damn it, Donovan, they're gone again.
2358180	2359180	What's happening?
2359180	2360180	I don't understand.
2360180	2362460	Has this always been happening to them lately?
2362460	2364420	I think it's what's happening to everybody around here.
2364420	2366260	I mean, you've seen people chanting numbers.
2366260	2368300	I think I have some connection.
2368300	2370460	For some reason, we're able to snap out of it appear.
2370460	2371700	It appears and others aren't.
2371700	2372700	I don't, I don't know.
2372700	2373700	I don't either.
2373700	2376860	I do little snappy fingers in front of Keith and John.
2376860	2377860	Nothing.
2377860	2378860	Since I'm not there.
2378860	2379860	I can't see this building.
2379860	2383860	Is there, is there an entrance into this building that isn't with these freakos in front of it?
2383860	2386340	They are far enough away from the entrance that you could go around.
2386340	2387340	I can skirt around.
2387340	2388340	That's exactly what I want to do.
2388340	2389340	Donovan.
2389340	2391420	I mean, I think we got to keep our eye on the prize.
2391420	2392740	These guys are going to snap out of it soon.
2392740	2396940	I got, we just have to wrangle up your three other friends that are all in a trance right
2396940	2397940	now.
2397940	2398940	Oh yeah.
2398940	2399940	Leon's with us still too, isn't he?
2399940	2400940	No.
2400940	2401940	Oh yes.
2401940	2402940	Oh my God.
2402940	2413020	Why is, why do you think he's not snapping out of it?
2413020	2414860	That's a goddamn good question, Donovan.
2414860	2416420	I don't know why he's not snapping out of it.
2416420	2417420	I do.
2417420	2420060	I, I go back to Leon again, do a couple of snaps in front of his face.
2420060	2421060	Leon!
2421060	2422060	Leon, get back here!
2422060	2423540	He is just boogying on down.
2423540	2424540	Can't stop, won't stop.
2424540	2425540	I don't know, Donovan.
2425540	2426540	I don't know.
2426540	2427540	I don't know.
2427540	2428540	Why is this not happening to me?
2428540	2429540	I don't understand.
2429540	2431500	I'm starting to think that you're the key to all this.
2431500	2433900	I just don't understand what to do with that.
2433900	2436880	The lights inside glass hall are on.
2436880	2439820	If you want to go around the back, I know, I know a good way.
2439820	2441960	I took it because I was always running late.
2441960	2443460	Whatever it gives us to the lab sooner.
2443460	2447300	Donovan, I don't even know what we're going to find there, but it is the task we've set
2447300	2450020	before us and I think we need to just stay the course.
2450020	2452080	Whatever you say, Clark, I'll follow you.
2452080	2456740	So do you guys want to skirt around this site and get into these front doors or do you want
2456740	2459940	to go around the side down an alleyway into the back?
2459940	2461140	No, the lights are on, right?
2461140	2462140	Yeah.
2462140	2464780	I'm going, I'm beelining for the door with the lights on.
2464780	2465780	I'll lead them to the side entrance.
2465780	2468980	Okay, and you lead the other three in, wait, what?
2468980	2469980	Donovan, over here.
2469980	2470980	These, these here.
2470980	2471980	These are the doors.
2471980	2473580	I'm like, I'm slowly walking away.
2473580	2475140	You were walking with the other three.
2475140	2478580	Yeah, I have the other three like dog leashes with me.
2478580	2480500	Clark's like, hey, hey, come back over here.
2480500	2487060	And as soon as you guys walk into glass hall, you see it's a nice like big entry foyer into
2487060	2492380	this and there are stairs immediately in front of you that lead down and there's a
2492380	2496020	sign that says biology lab in the basement.
2496020	2501260	As that happens, you hear, go ahead and roll alertness, both of you for me.
2501260	2503880	I pass a 27 on a 70.
2503880	2509140	I got a 44, so either a crit fail or a crit success.
2509140	2516740	You guys both hear the slapping of feet coming around the corner and heading down a hallway
2516740	2519140	toward you on your left side.
2519140	2525980	And you hear a woman's voice saying two, five, one, four, one, oh, got to get the gifts.
2525980	2526980	Got to get.
2526980	2527980	Oh yeah.
2527980	2532480	And then, uh, and then that's where he just got and just like running while just like
2532480	2535620	slurring and saying these numbers as they're coming.
2535620	2537560	Clark is basking in the light.
2537560	2541100	He's uh, arms outstretched, looking up at the fluorescent lights above him.
2541100	2542500	Donovan, didn't that just feel good?
2542500	2544220	Clark, what are you, what's going on?
2544220	2545220	What are you doing?
2545220	2546220	Just doesn't it feel good?
2546900	2547900	What feels good?
2547900	2548900	The light.
2548900	2551860	It feels like, it doesn't feel like anything.
2551860	2552860	It's fluorescent lighting.
2552860	2553860	It feels bad.
2553860	2554860	Just stretch them out.
2554860	2555860	To my eyes.
2555860	2556860	Just stretch them out, Donnie.
2556860	2557860	Just stretch out those arms.
2557860	2560900	Donovan like does like a weird, like very slight stretch.
2560900	2563220	Clark stands a little straighter, pops his neck.
2563220	2564880	All right, where's his lab?
2564880	2567060	Is it back down that way where the voices are?
2567060	2570900	You do, you see a sign that says biology lab in the basement.
2570900	2574900	The footsteps and the words mumbling weren't coming from any direction near there.
2574900	2576460	No, they were coming from a hallway.
2576460	2577460	Yeah, okay.
2577460	2582700	I think we should just go down and not engage with this other person.
2582700	2584500	I'm with you Don, let's go.
2584500	2590220	And as you guys head down the stairs, you hear the footsteps turn around and head back
2590220	2591460	the opposite way.
2591460	2595220	You notice John Lee Pettymore and Keith Vigna snap out of it.
2604900	2608980	What's up everybody?
2608980	2615020	Wolf the dog here.
2615020	2617540	Don't use this.
2617540	2622500	Every time you're on mic, what you're saying is being recorded.
2622500	2623740	We know that's not true.
2623740	2624740	You come to-
2624740	2626220	Because you leave so much gold on the floor.
2626220	2631500	You're standing on the stairs of a building that you don't remember walking into and you
2631500	2637980	look over and you see Donovan Westhaven and Clark Bishop staring at you.
2637980	2643420	And right behind you is Leon Simpson, still just grooving and grinding and bumping and
2643420	2644420	dapping.
2644420	2647380	Are we on the inside of this building or-
2647380	2652980	You are on the inside of this building and as you all look down, you see that these stairs
2652980	2660260	are covered in a trail of blood that is leading down into the basement and there are loose
2660260	2663780	screwdrivers that have been spilled onto these stairs.
2663780	2666580	So are we on the stairs that we're on are descending?
2666580	2667580	Yes.
2667580	2671700	Can we see where they might have been secured before they were strewn across these stairs?
2671700	2672700	No.
2672700	2673700	I know.
2673700	2674700	That's a joke.
2674700	2675700	Oh, it was good.
2675700	2676700	It's not.
2676700	2677700	I'm sorry.
2677700	2678700	Welcome back, fellas.
2678700	2679700	See the light in your eyes now.
2679700	2680700	What?
2680700	2681700	It happened again.
2681700	2682700	I know.
2682700	2689460	I feel every time I wake up from something like that, I don't feel like I've lost anything
2689460	2694900	but when I look at you and you've got this weird look on your face, I realize that-
2694900	2700820	You haven't lost anything nor have they gained anything while seemingly you were gone.
2700820	2702240	Quick question for you, Zach.
2702240	2705260	Did we gain anything from those intelligence rules?
2705260	2706260	Nope.
2706260	2707260	God damn it.
2707260	2709880	Can we gain any unnatural for being knocked out all these times?
2709880	2712700	You do lose a D4 of sanity.
2712700	2714980	So if you want to each roll a D4-
2714980	2715980	Oh, cool.
2715980	2717620	I wanted to roll.
2718620	2719620	I got a four.
2719620	2720620	Tight.
2720620	2721620	Me too.
2721620	2723620	This is fucking crazy.
2723620	2724620	All right.
2724620	2726020	So you each lose four sanity.
2726020	2727900	That brings me down to four sanity.
2727900	2729060	Where are you at, Luke?
2729060	2730180	I'm at 19.
2730180	2732940	My breaking point is 18.
2732940	2735540	You're the sane one here, man.
2735540	2739300	I also didn't recalculate my breaking point.
2739300	2742300	You hit your last breaking point exactly so it's minus your power.
2742300	2743300	Yeah.
2743300	2744300	There's no more breaking points for me.
2744300	2745300	All right.
2745300	2750940	I tried to write on this soft desk and instead of a nine, I just ripped the paper.
2750940	2752460	So give me a sec.
2752460	2753460	Character sheets, baby.
2753460	2756020	You're insane.
2756020	2761100	As you guys come to as you're walking down these stairs, you notice that there is a young
2761100	2768940	small ugly child wearing a backpack that is cleaning the baseboards with the veracity
2768940	2770820	of the veracity?
2770820	2772820	What's veracity?
2772820	2775140	Veracity is truthfulness.
2775140	2776440	Veracity is speed.
2776440	2779540	So somewhere in the middle there.
2779540	2785460	I think veracity is like how- Veracity is how velociraptory you are.
2785460	2786460	Oh yeah.
2786460	2787460	No.
2787460	2791440	The kid has his arms tucked in real tight and is just on his back haunches cleaning
2791440	2793580	the shit out of these baseboards.
2793580	2795220	Real velociraptory.
2795220	2799860	I pull my gun out and shoot him.
2799860	2800860	I do not do that.
2800860	2802860	You're the one at 19.
2802860	2804860	I don't do that.
2804860	2806220	I'm at four.
2806220	2812100	But the trail of blood moves past this child and into the floor below that you cannot see
2812100	2813100	yet.
2813100	2814100	I look at Clark.
2814100	2815100	Do you know what this blood is from?
2815100	2816100	I don't.
2816100	2819820	There was a sign up at the top up there that the biology lab was down this way.
2819820	2821900	So we just started moving down this way.
2821900	2828280	It doesn't look good, but I think, I mean- The trail of blood is leading to the lab?
2828280	2829280	To or from.
2829280	2830280	Can we tell?
2830280	2831280	Yeah.
2831280	2832280	Can we tell?
2832280	2833280	He said it was going down there.
2833280	2834280	It is moving toward.
2834700	2838480	It's moving from the stairs the way that the blood is tripping and the way that the blood
2838480	2839480	is like slid.
2839480	2840480	Are there any footprints?
2840480	2841480	It's being slid.
2841480	2847720	No, it seems to have been like, actually, go ahead and roll forensics.
2847720	2849080	I have a zero.
2849080	2850720	Do I even need to roll?
2850720	2851720	No.
2851720	2852720	I failed.
2852720	2853720	A 58 on a 50.
2853720	2854720	I got an 88.
2854720	2855720	Is that a 50?
2855720	2856720	I got a 20.
2856720	2857720	I got a 40.
2857720	2858720	Okay.
2858720	2864080	John Lee Pettymore would know that the blood is a person's body that was army crawling.
2864080	2866840	Away from there or down the stairs?
2866840	2871160	Someone in great pain crawled this way.
2871160	2875240	I just look at Clark and Donovan and wait for their next move.
2875240	2876840	I look at Donovan.
2876840	2879280	Where's that lab?
2879280	2880280	It's down here.
2880280	2881280	It's just to the right.
2881280	2882280	We're almost there.
2882280	2883640	Clark, I'm scared.
2883640	2891760	As I'm walking down the stairs, my pants have become uncuffed, and so they're draping around
2891760	2893520	my shoes a little bit.
2893520	2898720	And I slip, and I fall, and I just slide down the rest of the stairs.
2898720	2908880	And then I need everyone to leave the room real quick, except for Luke.
2908880	2924200	Luke, due to the sanity mechanics of this arc of the campaign, I need you to roll a
2924200	2928920	D100 three times for me, and tell me the three numbers that you roll.
2928920	2933760	A 6, a 52, and a 74.
2933760	2939120	You are going to choose between three manias, and this mania that you choose is going to
2939120	2946080	take over your entire personality, who you are, and everything goals-wise, what your
2946080	2948840	character is oriented towards.
2948840	2954480	Number 6 is agromania, the intense desire to be in open spaces.
2954480	2963120	52 is habromania, an abnormal tendency to create pleasant delusions in spite of reality.
2963120	2966800	So you would see something good, even when it's bad.
2966800	2967800	Exactly.
2967800	2976440	And 74 is onomamania, which is an obsession with names, people, places, things.
2976440	2980080	I'm going to go with the second one.
2980080	2987720	Yes, 52, which is habromania, which is an abnormal tendency to create pleasant delusions
2987720	2989600	in spite of reality.
2989600	2994600	As you're walking down the stairs, you slip and you fall to the bottom.
2994600	3001160	You see that there is just a trail of money from where you fell further into the basement
3001160	3006240	level, and there's just a pile of cash sitting there.
3006240	3012880	As I'm following the trail of money, I'm picking up every dollar, stuffing it into my, as we
3012880	3014880	know at this point, big britches.
3014880	3016160	Yo, huge.
3016200	3021960	Once I get up to the pile of money, I am standing there and I'm just handfuls of cash, shoving
3021960	3022960	them into my pockets.
3022960	3023960	Fantastic.
3023960	3025160	I'm going to get the other boys.
3025160	3046480	As Donovan Westhaven, Clark Bishop, John Lee Pettymore, and a groovin' Leon Simpson make
3046480	3053420	their way down the stairs, you see Keith Vigna slips, falls, and at the bottom of the stairs,
3053420	3060100	he lands in this pile of blood and loose screwdrivers, and he begins grabbing these screwdrivers
3060100	3065420	and putting them in his pockets, and then he's like grabbing up some of the blood, putting
3065420	3072860	it in his pockets, and as you guys continue down, I look at Clark, Clark, once this is
3072860	3081380	all over, I'm going to buy you as many TV dinners as you want, as many as you want.
3081380	3084660	You're going to buy me, I'll buy them all for you.
3084660	3086980	And then I continue shoving.
3086980	3095660	And well, see the thing is that as you continue shoving, they see you approach this flaccid,
3095660	3103300	bloody pile of an elderly woman's body that has screwdrivers just jutting out of it all
3103300	3108700	over the place, and Keith Vigna is grabbing these screwdrivers and pulling them out of
3108700	3112420	this lady and putting them in his giant britches.
3112420	3115420	Keith, what the fuck are you doing?
3115420	3116420	Are you kidding?
3116420	3119820	I mean, how are you guys not excited?
3119820	3121820	Oh my god!
3121820	3122820	Excited about...
3122820	3124820	Keith, stop picking us up!
3124820	3125820	We're rich!
3125820	3126820	We're rich!
3126820	3127820	Rich?
3127820	3128820	Yeah!
3128820	3129820	Oh my god!
3129820	3132540	Don't, don't get excited.
3132540	3136220	All material gain is merely temporary.
3136220	3137220	It's impermanent.
3137220	3138220	Keith, you're-
3138740	3139740	I'm just a fool.
3139740	3143660	These, these riches are merely illusory.
3143660	3147780	I look back at you, I'm like, I don't know why I'm even, I don't need to be here anymore.
3147780	3151300	I don't, this was my job, but I don't need one anymore.
3151300	3157420	And I look at Clark and I put my finger in my nose.
3157420	3160580	We're going to have a hell of a life.
3160580	3163020	Is that a Kanye reference?
3163020	3164900	It wasn't, but yeah, now it is, yes.
3164900	3168660	I need Thomas, Joe, and Justin to roll Sanity for me.
3168660	3172460	Did you hear me say it's a one?
3172460	3173460	Oh shit.
3173460	3175980	Uh, 26 on a one.
3175980	3177860	70 on a four.
3177860	3178860	I passed mine.
3178860	3179860	Okay, cool.
3179860	3180860	As is tradition.
3180860	3181860	Good for you.
3181860	3183860	Good for you, Justin.
3183860	3188300	Okay, so Clark, you're gonna lose your last Sanity.
3188300	3191620	Can I play it out, or do you have something else?
3191620	3195180	Yes, but real quick, John Lee Pettymore, roll a D4 for me.
3195180	3196180	Please roll a four.
3196180	3197180	Actually, roll a D6.
3197180	3198180	No, fuck you.
3198180	3202380	I've got a D4 in my hands, and I rolled a two.
3202380	3207420	You can, I'm not taking your shit this year, Zach.
3207420	3208420	2020.
3208420	3209420	2020.
3209420	3213900	2020, lose two Sanity.
3213900	3216060	I'm at two and I'm doing fine.
3216060	3218340	Yeah, you are, baby.
3218340	3220180	You do run the shit.
3220180	3223020	You do immediately start chanting numbers, however.
3223020	3225420	Those aren't numbers.
3225420	3228100	They might as well represent numbers, right?
3228100	3231700	Joe, if you would like to fully lose your Sanity.
3231700	3232700	I didn't have a big thing.
3232700	3238540	I was just gonna wide-eyed look at Keith and say, can I help you carry some of those?
3238540	3243780	I remove my finger from my nose and I offer it to him.
3243780	3249140	I don't know what it means, but- I shove it up his nose and I hold my thumb
3249140	3253100	like I'm shooting a finger gun and I...
3253100	3260140	And a fat bump of cocaine goes straight up into your dome.
3260140	3261260	Of real cocaine?
3261260	3264460	Real cocaine, out of Keith Vigna's finger.
3264460	3267420	Which the Patreon subscribers paid for.
3267420	3273620	And in that exact moment, Clark Bishop's eyes go blank and he begins chanting,
3273620	3278900	Ta-way alico, ta-way alico, ta-way alico, ta-way alico.
3278900	3280420	He's feeling it.
3280420	3281420	He's feeling it.
3281420	3285220	I look over at John and Donovan and I'm like, he's feeling it.
3285220	3287900	John leans into your finger.
3287900	3292040	I am the universe experiencing myself.
3292040	3297140	And I finger gun up into him as well.
3297140	3298220	What's Donovan doing?
3298220	3300100	Freaking the fuck out.
3300100	3303340	Donovan, this is college, baby.
3303340	3305340	This is college, baby.
3333340	3341340	How am I the only one trying to pull over?
3341340	3352340	How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?
3352340	3364340	How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?
