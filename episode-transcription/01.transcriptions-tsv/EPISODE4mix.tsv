0	6720	Welcome one and all to Contentions most exciting local news radio show, ran by yours truly,
6720	8520	Wolf the Dog.
8520	11120	Now let's jump right into some news.
11120	15300	Now I heard the officers went to Chief Maggie Cook's house, and boy wouldn't you know it,
15300	16300	she wasn't there.
16300	20680	And then they went on over to everybody's favorite bar, Klinker's.
20680	25560	You know, the one with the daycare in the back, serving up all the gourmet treats such
25560	31000	as hot dogs on white bread, ya boy Wolf's favorite meal.
31000	35480	Julie Maxwell had a restraining order put out against Leo Piston back 15 years ago for
35480	37000	killing her sister Ashley.
37000	39360	Now that is some messed up shit.
39360	43720	And John found the Chief's blue notebook, but where was the red and yellow notebooks?
43720	48800	And wouldn't you know it that some idiot at City Hospital fucked up and put Julie Maxwell
48800	49920	in the morgue.
49920	53600	She woke up from a coma and started bloody screaming.
53600	59520	Remember to tell your friends to tune in to 694.2 PTBP for all the hard hitting news
59520	62520	and best variety of music in Contention.
62520	69360	And we got a world premiere of a new song for y'all today, it's Kudzu with no backbone.
83600	87960	County called back about the junkyard body.
87960	93880	Drew looks nervous as he hands you the note, and the note says that body had been dead
93880	95440	for years.
95440	104000	The internal organs seem to have not functioned in roughly two centuries, but the skin and
104000	107700	hair looks to have died on December 1st.
107700	112520	They've never seen anything like this down at County, so go ahead and roll sand for me.
112520	113520	Wowza.
113520	114520	10.
114520	115520	Oh nice.
115520	116520	60.
116520	120520	I mean I assume you have far more than 10 sanity.
120520	123280	I'm feeling real good about hearing that crazy shit.
123280	124280	Yeah.
124280	128560	You immediately play that off in your mind, you rationalize it as either they don't know
128560	129560	what they're doing.
129560	130560	They messed something up.
130560	131560	They messed something up clearly.
131560	134320	You got some time to kill before the Piston Brothers come out.
134320	140280	Clark definitely wants to look at the file on the Ashley case when she was hit by the
140280	141280	car.
141280	142280	Oh the Ashley Maxwell.
142280	143280	Yeah.
143280	148480	Okay, so diving into the old file on the death of Ashley Maxwell, you'd find out that she
148480	154540	was on her way to Splashylvania, the town's weird vampire themed water park to meet up
154540	155540	with some friends.
155540	161920	Clark would remember that Splashylvania used to bring in snow machines in the winter months
161920	167360	and let the townspeople sled down the water slides that use sleds and go down.
167360	172700	This was very obviously a fucking awesome but terrible idea.
172700	177180	And after more than a few broken bones, the water park has only been open in the summer
177180	179360	months for the past decade or so.
179360	184760	So Ashley never showed up to the winterized water park that day on December 1st, so long
184760	185760	ago.
185760	188000	So her sister Julie went looking for her.
188000	194160	Julie found Ashley's body face down in a watery ditch on the side of the road.
194160	200360	She also saw the beat up truck that her former classmate Leo Piston drove around town.
200360	202880	It was heading toward the Piston pig farm.
202880	210280	The autopsy showed that Ashley had a severe concussion but actually died from drowning.
210280	216780	Leo Piston eventually broke down in a testimony and admitted that he had gotten out of his
216780	222660	truck to ask Ashley a question and he must have scared her because she sprayed him with
222660	228860	pepper spray and in his flailing about he accidentally hit her in the head and he immediately
228860	231620	drove home to get water on his eyes.
231620	237940	The Maxwell family, Ashley's family, was fervent in their disbelief of this story but the judge
237940	242480	was easy and gave him one year of juvenile detention.
242480	245860	So that's basically what you would learn from that file.
245860	247440	And what time of day was all that?
247440	251660	Right after school, basically on December 1st, so her and her friends and her sister
251660	257540	and her friends, they were all meeting up to go do the like sledding at Splashylvania.
257540	258540	But she never made it.
258540	259540	Sad.
259540	262960	Who was the officer or detective on that case?
262960	268300	I think the chief would have taken lead for sure on the, yeah, dead teenager.
268300	269300	I dig it.
269300	273780	So that one, that probably took you a while to go through, find all that info.
273780	276300	And yeah, Clark was just doing that to refresh himself.
276300	277300	For sure.
277300	278300	Yeah.
278300	279300	For sure.
279300	284620	This is the first block when an awkwardly tall, skinny man with gin blossoms and bad
284620	288500	teeth walks into the police station and he is visibly distraught.
288500	290860	This is not George Piston.
290860	295140	He walks right past Drew and stumbles a bit into your desk.
295140	301100	You can smell the alcohol in his breath as he mumbles, my friend is gone and you haven't
301100	302500	done anything about it.
302500	304740	Where is this missing person's whatever?
304740	306820	Why aren't you looking for him right now?
306820	307820	Do I recognize him?
307820	309060	You've never seen this guy before.
309060	310060	Whoa, buddy.
310060	312340	Hey, what are you doing?
312340	313340	What's going on here?
313340	316740	My friend is gone and you're not doing anything about it.
316740	320020	I'm standing up and trying to get him to sit down in my chair.
320020	321900	Just he just seems wobbly.
321900	324100	And so, yeah, you can, you can get him down.
324100	325100	Yeah.
325100	326820	Hey, uh, but what's, what's going on?
326820	327940	You're you're, you're talking gibberish.
327940	328940	Yeah, you're fine.
328940	333500	He stands up and he comes around to your side of the desk and starts like messing through
333500	334500	your papers.
334500	335500	Hey, whoa, sir.
335500	337260	Hey, I need you to sit down.
337260	339220	You got to do your fucking job, man.
339220	340220	All right.
340220	341980	I'll listen to you, but you got to sit down first.
341980	342980	All right.
342980	343980	All right.
343980	344980	All right.
344980	345980	What's your name?
345980	346980	Officer Bishop.
346980	347980	Officer.
347980	354140	I just, my friend John Peters is gone and I went by his house earlier and the lock was
354140	361020	busted and there was a mess inside and he hasn't been online in like a couple of days
361020	362540	and that's not like John.
362540	370420	And so I need to, I need to know why you're just sitting here when he's fucking gone.
370420	373020	We, we, uh, we've actually been alerted to that case.
373020	374300	We've, we've been working on it.
374300	375740	Uh, when was the last time you saw him?
375740	379220	I haven't seen him in like forever, honestly.
379220	387440	We just like, you know, he's just an old friend from the days and we used to know each other.
387440	399940	So I, I just, I, he like starts crying and then he like stands up and just walks to the
399940	402840	back of the police station basically.
402840	406120	And he just is like looking around at different stuff.
406120	409020	Hey, hey bud, come up, come back over here.
409020	410280	What's your name?
410280	411280	Your name?
411280	413040	Your, your officer Bishop.
413040	414040	Yep.
414040	415040	You got that right.
415040	416040	Now what's, what's yours?
416040	417040	I'm Charles.
417640	419600	Hey Charles, come, come on back here.
419600	422360	That's let's get to the bottom of this right now.
422360	431040	That's someone, someone fucking, I took my friend I think, and you need to find him.
431040	432320	Why do you think somebody took him?
432320	436520	Because his shit is broke and somebody clearly busted into shit.
436520	437520	Yeah.
437520	439440	Do you have a reason to think that somebody would want to do that?
439440	445360	Well, his fucking keys are gone and his shit was broke and so his car's fucking gone and
445360	449160	like I know John and he wouldn't do that.
449160	454040	So do you know anybody who would want to do that to him with somebody who fucking know
454040	456040	I, John's a chilled ass dude.
456040	460960	I, there's no reason that anybody would want to be taking him.
460960	461960	All right.
461960	462960	We came to that conclusion as well.
462960	463960	Do you have this stuff?
463960	464960	What did you find?
464960	465960	We didn't find a whole lot there.
465960	468880	We are under the assumption at this point that he left in a hurry.
468880	477440	But fucking, yeah, I, someone left in a hurry probably with him cause he wouldn't do that.
477440	479480	Do you have his, do you have his keys?
479480	480480	Yeah.
480480	481480	Yeah.
481480	482480	But we, we, we've got his keys.
482480	485840	Let me see his fucking keys.
485840	487000	Why do you want to see his keys?
487000	493640	Cause I don't, I don't necessarily trust you if you're like yanking me around.
493640	497080	I mean I'm an officer of the law, you can trust me, but just to get this over with,
497080	498080	sure.
498280	499280	Okay.
499280	500280	Cool.
500280	503880	I pull them out of my desk and I'm holding them way far away from him and literally showing
503880	504880	him.
504880	505880	Okay.
505880	511360	He like puts both of his hands like on the desk and leans in and boy howdy does his breath
511360	518560	just reek of booze and he is staring very intently.
518560	522800	He holds his hand out and he gets kind of sad and he's like, can I see him?
522800	524120	Oh no, you can, you can see him.
524120	525120	You can't touch him.
525120	527440	Can I see him with my, with my hand?
527800	528800	I'm sorry, sir.
528800	530320	Uh, have you had something to drink tonight?
530320	531320	Yeah.
531320	532520	How'd you get here?
532520	534120	I got a car.
534120	535120	Did you drive here?
535120	536120	Nah.
536120	538480	If I went outside, would I see a car that wasn't here earlier?
538480	553160	No, I'm, I mean, I, I walked and he leans back, I, uh, I'm putting the keys back in
553160	559480	the desk while that exchange is occurring and just, just give it to me straight officer.
563480	567760	Sir, we, uh, we don't know where your friend is right now, but I can promise you that we
567760	574240	hear a sound from the parking lot of the police station, like abrupt thunder or a small explosion.
574240	580240	Charles, the guy standing in front of you immediately pulls a gun and runs outside.
580240	581240	What do you do?
581240	582240	Holy shit.
582320	583320	Sir, wait, no.
583320	584320	He's fucking.
584320	585320	Stop.
585320	586320	Okay.
586320	588320	If he's already outside, I'm running after him.
588320	589320	Okay.
589320	593800	As you, as you run out the door of the police station, you see the older piston brothers
593800	597640	truck has been T-boned on its driver's side.
597640	603600	A large black SUV is reversing onto the street and begins to drive east.
603600	604600	Roll alertness.
604600	605600	Holy shit.
605600	609600	Uh, 95 on a 70.
609600	610600	Okay.
610960	612960	I didn't see any of that.
612960	621240	You see Leo piston in the driver's seat of this black SUV and you fail to note the license
621240	624040	plate as it begins to drive away.
624040	630000	Charles runs to a car that is parked in the parking lot and gets behind the wheel.
630000	631000	What do you do?
631000	632000	I'm yelling.
632000	633000	No stop.
633000	634000	Gun is probably drawn.
634000	635000	Yeah.
635000	636000	Gun is drawn on him.
636000	637000	Okay.
637000	638000	Stop.
638000	639840	I'm probably getting around to his driver's side if he's already getting in the car.
640080	641080	Oh yeah.
641080	642080	He's getting in.
642080	644800	Uh, go ahead and roll athletics to get.
644800	645800	So real fast.
645800	646800	Yeah.
646800	652080	The black SUV t-bone t-bone what car George pistons truck, which was sitting in the parking
652080	653080	lot.
653080	654080	Any sign of George?
654080	655080	Yeah.
655080	656080	George is in his truck.
656080	657080	He's been smashed.
657080	658080	You can kind of see him.
658080	659880	He's behind the wheel of his own truck.
659880	665760	So Leo, his brother smashed him in the black SUV driving in the black SUV.
665760	666760	Uh, okay.
666760	668960	So you wanted me to draw a, do athletics.
668960	669960	Yes.
669960	673280	Uh, 61 on a 30.
673280	674280	Okay.
674280	680480	So as you run up to the car that this new fella Charles is in, he backs up and he's
680480	685200	got enough time to get onto the road before you can really get to him.
685200	686200	What do you do?
686200	687600	He's, he's on the road in his car.
687600	691920	He is pulling out of the police station parking lot onto the road.
691920	692920	Fuck.
692920	697000	I am running over to my cruiser and getting on the radio.
697000	698560	We got a situation down here guys.
698560	699560	Come on.
699560	700560	Uh, Oh shit.
700560	701560	Uh, fuck.
701560	703440	Uh, we got a, we got a, uh, a wreck in the parking lot.
703440	706600	There's a, uh, a guy's just taken off gun in hand.
706600	707880	Leo's in a, in a black SUV.
707880	709600	I didn't catch the damn plate.
709600	711880	I need, I need some help down here guys.
711880	712880	Perfect.
712880	718840	Ooh, it's going down.
718840	719840	Everything's happening.
719840	720840	It's all happening.
720840	721840	Nice.
721840	722840	Cool.
722840	723840	Okay.
723840	730440	So if you'll remember, Keith was at the piston pig farm and you had just climbed over the
730440	731440	fence.
731440	738480	Keith, as you walk up on the massive piston pig farm, you see a large farmhouse, a small
738480	744600	farmhouse, a barn, a warehouse, and acres and acres of land.
744600	751880	Leo's old rusty farm truck sits next to the small farmhouse and there is a large SUV next
751880	753920	to the large farmhouse.
753920	759760	Sitting next to the large warehouse is a line of old school buses, most of which are broken
759760	764760	down and have plants and tall grasses growing up in and around them.
764760	769000	Go ahead and roll luck for me.
769000	773880	That's a 19 on a 60, 19 on a 60.
773880	774880	That's a pass.
774880	775880	All right, cool.
775880	781660	So as you approach, as you're walking up to the pig farm, you feel warmth running under
781660	783260	your left foot.
783260	789540	As you realize you hear the sound of a gunshot, you look down and see some blood pooling underneath
789540	790540	your shoe.
790540	793980	Take one point of damage and roll sand.
793980	795620	I failed my sanity check.
795620	799520	Okay, so go ahead and lose one sanity as well as one hit point.
799520	800520	What do you do?
800520	801520	So I'm bleeding.
801520	804540	I want to see where exactly did I get hit?
804540	805540	Right in the foot.
805540	806540	Right in the foot.
806540	807660	Do I know where the gunshot came from?
807660	808980	Like which direction?
808980	813060	Go ahead and roll search.
813060	814060	Don't pass.
814060	815060	Okay.
815060	820100	You're looking around and you hear, you're doing a trespassing there, sir.
820100	821780	I didn't mean to hit you.
821780	823500	Just meant to scare you a bit.
823500	826020	And it's coming from the large farmhouse.
826020	832160	And as you look up to see where this voice is coming from, you see a woman in the window
832160	835540	of the large farmhouse and she's like holding a rifle.
835540	838900	I'm going to like hold my badge up and hold my gun up.
838920	842220	Officer Vigna, I need you to put your weapon down right now.
842220	843220	Oh shit.
843220	845560	Keith, is that you?
845560	846560	It's me.
846560	848460	Little Keith Vigna.
848460	849460	Holy shit.
849460	850460	Yeah.
850460	851580	Do you have a first aid kit in there?
851580	852780	You shot me in the foot.
852780	853780	I am.
853780	854780	God damn it.
854780	859540	She comes running out and she's holding a, she's holding a first aid kit.
859540	863080	And as she runs up to you, she's like, Oh fuck officer.
863080	865220	I am so fucking sorry.
865220	866900	Get that shoe off for me real quick.
866900	868500	I kicked that shoe off.
868500	869500	Okay.
869500	871260	And so also can we do this inside?
871260	873540	Oh yeah, absolutely.
873540	878660	So she'll take you like you can put your arm around her and she'll walk you into the large
878660	879660	farmhouse.
879660	880660	Okay, great.
880660	886920	So she sits you down on a, on an old chair, slides an ottoman over and as you're in here,
886920	889820	you would see this place is, yeah, I want to do like a quick look around.
889820	891740	It's actually kind of nice in here.
891740	893420	It's not too dirty.
893420	898460	There's some stuff about, it's not super tidy, but it's not like overly messy.
898460	901860	And it's not overly gross in any sort of way.
901860	906700	So she'll get your foot up on that ottoman and begin wrapping it.
906700	912140	And she says, seriously, officer, I shit, I did not mean to actually hit you.
912140	915940	I was just, I didn't even recognize you and I didn't see the uniform.
915940	917300	I was just really worried.
917300	921100	I, you know, with all, I don't, I don't know, you know, you got to protect your property
921100	922100	and whatnot.
922100	928600	I understand, but I need you to understand what you did is a high crime here.
928600	929600	High crime?
929600	930600	High crime.
930600	931600	High crime?
931600	932600	Oh Jesus.
932600	934780	But you know, I, I came without warning.
934780	937660	So you know, I think I get what I get at this point.
937660	941700	The Maggie, Maggie cook sent me to look or have a look around here.
941700	943580	Oh, why is that officer?
943580	947900	Oh, you know, just, it's part of a part of the investigation.
947900	951100	You're not in trouble or anything, but this has to do with the body at the junkyard.
951100	955820	I didn't say that, but well, I mean, George, George is headed out with Leo down to the
955820	956820	police station.
956820	961980	So I would assume that you stayed behind to what now?
961980	969780	Well, just to make sure nothing, there was no trouble you trying to live up to that family
969780	970780	name of yours.
970780	975700	I guess I knew that I didn't think anyone was home, so I was just going to do a quick
975700	978860	search of the perimeter, make sure nothing was up and I was going to get, get back to
978860	979860	the station.
979860	982340	Did you have a, did you have a warrant for that?
982340	988460	Yeah, but, uh, I've dropped it as soon as you shot me cause it scared me so bad.
988460	996420	Uh, you're going to roll persuade against her human.
996420	998620	That's a 50 on a 70 for me.
998620	999620	Okay.
999620	1000620	And she failed.
1000620	1006880	So, uh, and for the listeners, human is human intelligence and it would be like deciphering
1006880	1010360	human emotions through action and voice.
1010360	1011960	She uh, she buys it.
1011960	1013360	Oh, oh shoot.
1013360	1014360	Okay.
1014360	1015360	Uh, well fuck.
1015360	1016360	I am.
1016360	1017360	Oh boy.
1017360	1018360	Okay.
1018360	1025680	Well, you know, Keith, I knew your parents and you know, I, I, I'd really appreciate
1025680	1027120	you letting this one slide.
1027120	1029720	I think, I think we, I think we're on the same page here.
1029720	1033480	You know, I think if you just, if you put on a cup of coffee for me and let me just
1033480	1036200	take a look around, we'll forget that this ever happened.
1036200	1037200	Sounds good.
1037200	1042520	Uh, so she goes back and as she's walking back to the kitchen to put on a pot of coffee,
1042520	1044880	her phone starts doing the alarm.
1044880	1053520	That's like the, that, that annoying alarm from the atomic meltdown.
1053520	1058240	And she hollers from the other room, Hey, um, I've, I've actually got some, some coffee
1058240	1059240	back here.
1059240	1060240	That's ready to go.
1060240	1061240	Do you like iced coffee?
1061240	1062880	Not really, but I'll drink it.
1062880	1063880	I guess.
1063880	1064880	Okay.
1064880	1065880	That's, that's perfect.
1066560	1070280	I'll be back fairly quick with a plastic cup with iced coffee in it.
1070280	1074320	That's so you can take it to go and kind of looked at you.
1074320	1078840	Well, uh, that's awful nice of you, but I will be sticking around for a minute, uh,
1078840	1080280	to take, take a little peek around.
1080280	1084520	If you got something to do, feel free to go do that and I'll lock up behind you, but I'll
1084520	1086520	be here for a minute.
1086520	1087640	Oh, okay.
1087640	1091040	And I glanced down at my foot and then glanced back.
1091040	1092040	Yeah.
1092080	1097320	And she's like, uh, okay, uh, I'm, I'm gonna be right back then.
1097320	1098320	Okay.
1098320	1099320	Take your time.
1099320	1100320	She, uh, pops out the back door.
1100320	1101320	Okay.
1101320	1102320	Fuck yeah.
1102320	1103320	Free range.
1103320	1106320	I think I'm going to just do some snooping in this main house real quick.
1106320	1107320	Okay.
1107320	1108320	What are you looking for?
1108320	1109320	I don't know.
1109320	1114880	Particularly like anything that just doesn't seem like the pistons would have like, I know
1114880	1117580	in my mind who these people probably are, right.
1117580	1122300	Anything that pops out, out of the ordinary, I'm going to be digging through, not digging
1122300	1125620	through drawers, but open drawers up, looking through that and just kind of searching this
1125620	1127260	main house at first.
1127260	1128260	Gotcha.
1128260	1129260	Okay.
1129260	1131300	So this main house is like I said before, it's, it's fairly well kept.
1131300	1135100	It's pretty clear after snooping around for a while that this is where Kathy and George
1135100	1136100	live.
1136100	1138220	And they have an extra bedroom.
1138220	1142440	That's a guest bedroom that is completely neat and unused.
1142440	1148560	There's another room in the farmhouse as well that it is filled with Mary Kay stuff.
1148560	1149560	Okay.
1149560	1150560	Yeah.
1150560	1153640	And you would know Kathy, which is this woman, Kathy Piston.
1153640	1154640	She's a Mary Kay.
1154640	1155640	That's her side hustle.
1155640	1156640	Yeah, absolutely.
1156640	1163920	And she's like very into it and wears kind of an absurd amount of makeup for a pig farmer.
1163920	1164920	Right.
1164920	1165920	Okay.
1165920	1170480	So if I don't find anything of interest in there, I'm going to go over to the small farmhouse,
1170480	1171800	which I assume is Leo's.
1171800	1172840	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1172840	1178400	It's where his, uh, his old beat up truck is parked as you, uh, go ahead and roll alertness
1178400	1183120	for me 92 on a 60 nice.
1183120	1193440	As you are going to the small farmhouse, you see the door on the big warehouse shut.
1193440	1198200	There's no one standing around there and you just see the door shut and you walk into the
1198200	1199900	small farmhouse.
1199900	1203380	This is Leo's place and it is quite different.
1203380	1205140	It is a shithole.
1205140	1206140	Filthy.
1206140	1207140	It's gross.
1207140	1213340	He works with the pigs all day and he does not take off his shoes when he gets home.
1213340	1214340	Gotcha.
1214340	1218300	So there's pig shit inside this place like casually look around.
1218300	1221100	I'm not going to investigate too bad in here cause I don't want to be in here.
1221100	1222100	Yeah.
1222100	1223100	It smells fucking awful.
1223100	1225060	There's like rancid food in the kitchen.
1225060	1226380	Is it just one story?
1226380	1228100	It is one bedroom.
1228100	1230620	The bathroom and the kitchen are like one thing together.
1230620	1234820	I'm going to glance around real quick and see if I find anything.
1234820	1236180	Go ahead and roll search for me.
1236180	1237180	Nope.
1237180	1238380	46 on a 40.
1238380	1239380	Pig shit.
1239380	1240380	Pig shit for days.
1240380	1242140	I get out of there like ASAP and then I want to go.
1242140	1250120	You said there's the warehouse and then a, like a shed or, uh, there's a barn and a warehouse.
1250120	1251120	That's it.
1251120	1252120	Yeah.
1252120	1253120	Yeah.
1253120	1254900	Um, since I saw the warehouse door closed, I'm going to go to the barn first and leave
1254900	1256900	the warehouse to be my last place.
1256900	1257900	Okay.
1258100	1262980	So you would go and open up the barn door.
1262980	1265880	It's two big swinging doors right in front of it.
1265880	1271100	And inside is just bales of hay, a couple of horses.
1271100	1272100	This is like the stables basically.
1272100	1274100	I'm going to go pet one of the horses.
1274100	1275100	Cool.
1275100	1276100	It's chill.
1276100	1277100	Cool.
1277100	1279380	Uh, I want to glance around, kind of poke around a little bit.
1279380	1282460	See if there's any, this seems like a good place to hide something.
1282460	1283460	So sure.
1283460	1284460	Sure.
1284460	1285460	Sure.
1285460	1286460	Go ahead and roll search for me again.
1286460	1287460	Shit.
1287520	1290520	75 on 40.
1290520	1291520	Killing it.
1291520	1292980	I'm doing some Vigna style police work.
1292980	1295800	This is some Vigna police work.
1295800	1299500	You look around and there seems to be nothing out of place.
1299500	1300940	This is a normal barn.
1300940	1304700	Wait, did you say the warehouse has the, the buses by it?
1304700	1305700	Yes.
1305700	1310180	I want to go sneak into one of the buses and post up and see if I see anybody coming out
1310180	1311180	of the warehouse.
1311180	1313180	Okay, cool.
1313180	1314180	Okay.
1314220	1318300	Where are you going in inside this bus and which bus are you going to?
1318300	1322460	I'm going to the bus that's closest to the door that I saw close.
1322460	1323460	Okay.
1323460	1326700	And I'm going to just get in there to where like I can just pop down if I see somebody
1326700	1327700	and hide.
1327700	1328700	Okay.
1328700	1329700	Sounds good.
1329700	1334540	You're kind of looking out the window, uh, in one of the back seats of the bus and you're
1334540	1340060	looking at that door and the door opens and Kathy pops her head out and is scanning.
1340060	1341060	You roll luck.
1341060	1342060	Oh.
1342940	1344940	49 on a 60.
1344940	1345940	Okay.
1345940	1350740	So she kind of scans over to where you're at and you pop your head down just in time.
1350740	1358660	And then as you pop your head back up, she comes out the door with a line of people.
1358660	1366660	So many fucking people start piling out of this warehouse and she gets on the bus.
1366660	1367660	My bus?
1367660	1369460	The bus that you're in the back of.
1369460	1371400	And she sits in the driver's seat.
1371840	1375040	And I'm immediately, I'm popping down behind that back seat.
1375040	1381060	The bus begins filling up with people and you hear voices and it's all muffled and they're
1381060	1383280	all chitter chattering together.
1383280	1387540	And it starts to smell really bad on this bus.
1387540	1390880	And it's not that pig smell from Leo's farmhouse.
1390880	1392360	It's a different kind of smell.
1392360	1400360	It's the, it's the odor of the homeless population who is now residing on this school bus.
1400360	1406600	There are as many people as can fit on a normal sized yellow school bus plus some.
1406600	1409600	Are you looking up how many people can fit on a school bus?
1409600	1411800	God, how many rows are there in a school bus?
1411800	1412800	Okay.
1412800	1413800	How many people does a school bus?
1413800	1414800	It's 72 passengers.
1414800	1415800	Okay.
1415800	1421520	So there are a hundred people on this school bus and they are not paying any attention
1421520	1424600	to you, but they are so close to you.
1424600	1428640	You're like crouched behind this back seat and they are smashed.
1428640	1435240	Three people per bench and then everyone like standing throughout the entire row and
1435240	1436720	the bus begins to move.
1436720	1437720	What do you do?
1437720	1438720	Fuck.
1438720	1444160	I'm so fucking glad this is happening.
1444160	1452040	I, um, well shit, I'm going to open up the back door and I hope to God the alarm doesn't
1452040	1453040	go off.
1453040	1454600	The emergency door in the back.
1454600	1455600	Fuck yeah.
1455600	1456600	Okay.
1456840	1467160	Roll luck for me cause we're just going to see, so yeah, so you, okay, here's what happens.
1467160	1474120	You reach over and you grab the, the handle of the door in the back and as you open it,
1474120	1478160	the door immediately opens and alarm starts sounding.
1478160	1483760	It's going and you fall out the back of the door.
1483760	1488320	Go ahead and roll athletics to see how well you take this fall.
1488320	1491520	I got a fucking 99.
1491520	1496200	Hell yeah dude.
1496200	1499520	Um, okay.
1499520	1500520	Okay.
1500520	1502520	A critical fail.
1502520	1503520	It's a critical fail.
1503520	1509640	Uh, so you're going to roll a, we're going to double a d four cause I was going to make
1509640	1511360	it a d four for falling out.
1511360	1516400	Double a d four, two, like one times two, one times two.
1516400	1522240	Uh, you take two damage, you fall and you fall on the exact same foot that got shot
1522240	1524660	earlier and your ankle rolls.
1524660	1529840	And so now it is like almost impossible to use that foot and put weight on it.
1529840	1536120	But as you fall out, the door slams back closed and you hear the alarm stop ringing as it
1536120	1543100	slams shut and the bus peels out on the County road and drives away, leaving you sitting
1543100	1549480	in the middle of the road, which is not actually the main drive that you were on earlier.
1549480	1552560	It's this back way that you didn't even notice before.
1552560	1557480	So you were actually probably half a mile from the warehouse, which is on the far south
1557480	1558920	part of the property.
1558920	1560920	What's my movement speed at this point.
1560920	1565040	If I wanted to go back to that warehouse, you can hop on one foot.
1565960	1570880	Well, I mean, I'm on the opposite side of where my car is anyway, so I'm gonna hop back
1570880	1572280	to that warehouse.
1572280	1573280	Okay.
1573280	1580400	You hop and you're not like the most elegant man on earth.
1580400	1587000	And so you multiple times fall over on your way there, but you make it to the warehouse.
1587000	1588000	What do you want to do?
1588000	1589480	I want to see what's in this.
1589480	1591080	Oh God.
1591080	1593280	So you open up the door and
1593320	1594320	Flashlight on.
1594320	1595320	Flashlight on.
1595320	1601040	It's dark in there, but there's a lot of windows on the top of the building and probably some
1601040	1602360	like sunroofing.
1602360	1603700	This is where all the pigs are.
1603700	1605320	It's an indoor operation.
1605320	1609800	And so inside the warehouse is this massive pig farming operation.
1609800	1613880	There are hundreds of pigs separated into different sections of the warehouse and what
1613880	1618780	looks to be an irrigation system running just above the head of an average man that sprays
1618780	1622080	cool water down into the pins every once in a while.
1622080	1623080	Only pigs in here, right?
1623080	1624080	Yeah.
1624080	1626480	There's just a bunch of pigs and it smells like pig shit.
1626480	1630000	Are there any sleeping bags or anything like that or were these people, do I think these
1630000	1634320	homeless people were there just like for a short amount of time or do you have absolutely
1634320	1639440	no idea how that many people fit in here with all these pigs?
1639440	1643400	Because the rows in between the pig pins are very thin.
1643400	1646920	Well, not very thin, but like one person, right?
1646920	1649200	Two people, not, you know?
1649200	1650200	Yeah.
1650200	1651200	Okay.
1651320	1655200	They would have had to just been standing there for that many people to be in there.
1655200	1657360	I want to do a search roll just to see if I...
1657360	1658800	Go ahead and roll a search.
1658800	1659800	No.
1659800	1660800	80.
1660800	1661800	80?
1661800	1662800	Okay.
1662800	1663800	So you hop around.
1663800	1666480	You can use the pins at this point to get around easier.
1666480	1667480	You don't find anything.
1667480	1668480	Okay.
1668480	1669480	I'm going to hop back to...
1669480	1670480	Oh, hey.
1670480	1675040	Quick reminder, you can burn luck to make any of these rolls a success.
1675040	1680400	We haven't done that yet in this campaign so far because we've never actually used this
1680400	1683200	luck mechanic in our home games before.
1683200	1686720	And so we all keep forgetting about it, but yeah, you can always spend luck.
1686720	1689520	Wish I would have known about that five minutes ago.
1689520	1691520	When a lot of bad stuff happened.
1691520	1693200	Yeah, I forgot about it too.
1693200	1696160	Well, I guess I'm going to hop back.
1696160	1698760	I want to hop back to the house real quick.
1698760	1699760	Okay.
1699760	1705320	As you're hopping back to the house, you get a call on your radio, which is attached to
1705320	1707060	you on your person.
1707060	1708600	And it is Clark.
1708600	1710160	We got a situation down here, guys.
1710920	1711920	Oh, shit.
1711920	1712920	Fuck.
1712920	1715080	We got a wreck in the parking lot.
1715080	1718120	There's a guy who's just taken off gun in hand.
1718120	1719480	Leo's in a black SUV.
1719480	1721160	I didn't catch the damn plate.
1721160	1723160	I need some help down here, guys.
1730160	1734240	Okay, so you are heading to the hospital in the city to meet Julie Maxwell?
1734240	1735240	Yes.
1735240	1739520	John Lee Pettymore arrives at the hospital in the city, and as you are walking through
1739560	1744680	the parking lot to the entrance of the large building, a man jumps out at you from in between
1744680	1745680	two parked cars.
1745680	1747680	I immediately draw him again and fire.
1755680	1756680	Roll firearms.
1756680	1758680	Oh, we're doing this.
1760680	1762680	No, he's not involved in this.
1762680	1765680	I don't want to do the paperwork.
1765840	1769840	Okay, but you would probably get a hand on the gun real quick.
1769840	1772840	Yeah, I reached for the handle of my pistol.
1772840	1778840	He's this like weird hunched dude wearing an old tattered robe with a hood that's covering
1778840	1782840	his face, and he says, Oogie boogie there, my friend.
1782840	1785680	I know what you are.
1785680	1788960	I know where you're from.
1788960	1794320	He cackles and he whispers, Say hello to me, would ya?
1794960	1800960	As he hands you a folded up piece of paper, and he runs away into the darkness.
1803960	1805960	Oh, there's a lot on this paper.
1808960	1810960	Oh, shit.
1810960	1814960	I immediately radio into the station that we're dealing with some kind of robot.
1814960	1823960	The note he handed me is just a bunch of binary, looks to be maybe 20 or 30 words, all in binary,
1824600	1827600	and then just in English.
1829600	1834600	You know, as if my day wasn't already busy enough, I'm going to radio this in.
1834600	1840600	I'm going to take a picture of this with my phone, send it to Randy and Andy.
1840600	1841600	Drew.
1841600	1842600	To Drew.
1842600	1847600	And ask one of them to try to get a translation on that, and while I'm calling them, I also,
1847600	1853600	I don't know if anybody else has done this yet, but those keys we found marked with G10
1854240	1856240	through 12 or whatever it was.
1856240	1861240	I want to get one of them just so we're doing the legwork of checking out local mini storages.
1861240	1865240	Right, so those keys are in Clark Bishop's desk.
1865240	1871240	Vigna threw them to him earlier when you guys were in the station, and Clark has them in
1871240	1872240	his desk.
1872240	1874240	Yeah, you can send that message on to Drew.
1874240	1877600	Literally, I just need somebody doing the groundwork of like, hey, where is the storage
1877600	1880600	within nearby that has G units?
1880600	1882600	You could ask Tim to do it.
1882600	1883600	G unit.
1883600	1884600	Yeah.
1884600	1885600	I'd do that.
1885600	1886600	Okay, cool.
1886600	1887600	So.
1887600	1888600	Real quick.
1888600	1889600	Who's Tim?
1889600	1895600	Oh, Tim, the guy who works at the police station who does like everything.
1895600	1896600	Ray?
1896600	1897600	No.
1897600	1900600	I just called him Randy, but I definitely thought we went with Ray.
1900600	1904600	It's weird because you think his name is Ray, but.
1904600	1907600	No, you're pretty sure it's Tim.
1907600	1909600	I always liked Tim.
1909600	1910600	I asked him to do that.
1910600	1911600	Yeah, sounds good.
1911600	1917240	Okay, so as you walk into the large hospital, you see a desk with a woman sitting behind
1917240	1921200	it next to a large Christmas tree and a life-size nativity scene.
1921200	1922200	What do you want to do?
1922200	1924200	I'd like to see Julie Maxwell, please.
1924200	1927600	Yeah, she lets you know that Julie Maxwell is in room 1030.
1927600	1932600	I take the stairs because, you know, you don't want to be a lard ass.
1932600	1940480	All right, so John Lee Pettymore, as you walk into room 1030, you see two beds, and one
1940480	1945080	is an old man with mutton chops and large, thick eyebrows.
1945080	1948480	I immediately hold out my hand and say, hello, Julie.
1948480	1950160	Oh, what?
1950160	1952080	The other bed is empty.
1952080	1953960	My name's Doug.
1953960	1954960	My apologies, sir.
1954960	1957080	Have you seen a young woman?
1957080	1960280	No, there was a- Any woman?
1960280	1963440	There's like a middle-aged- Yeah, that sounds about right, giving her
1963440	1964720	past and backstory.
1964720	1965960	She was crazy.
1965960	1966960	She was in here.
1966960	1968400	I didn't like her one bit.
1968400	1969600	I'm glad she's gone.
1969600	1970600	Where is she now?
1970600	1974200	She just got up, I don't know, about half an hour ago and left.
1974200	1975440	Thank you for your time, Doug.
1975440	1983200	I immediately head to security or wherever this place keeps their cameras and ask them
1983200	1985080	to find out where Julie went.
1985080	1989280	This would take a little time, but you would find out after looking through the cameras,
1989280	1996320	you would see that she walked out the front door half an hour ago, gown open, just heading
1996320	1997640	out into the world.
1997680	2008040	Okay, I call the city PD and ask if anybody has brought in a gown-wearing crazy woman
2008040	2009720	matching her description.
2009720	2012280	Not today.
2012280	2015360	The city's pretty rough and tumble.
2015360	2017600	It's no place to raise a family.
2017600	2018600	Absolutely not.
2018600	2023320	I kind of explained what's going on and the pretty serious ... This is not just some random
2023320	2027200	... This is a very important suspect in a murder case.
2027840	2034840	So if I explain that, do I get any assistance or offers for a squad car to go look for or
2034840	2035840	something?
2035840	2036840	They're busy.
2036840	2037840	You're a small-town cop.
2037840	2038840	They don't give a fuck.
2038840	2042640	If it's a murder case and we get a hold of her, then we'll let you know.
2042640	2043640	Okay.
2043640	2044640	Well, you have been no help.
2044640	2045640	Thank you very much.
2045640	2046640	Perfect.
2046640	2047640	I hope no one else dies.
2047640	2057120	How'd you feel if your whole family's faces were smashed or ripped?
2058040	2062160	Okay, so I'm going to take off in my cruiser in the direction that she left and try to
2062160	2065360	look for her, but I also have some other things I want to do while I'm in the city.
2065360	2071840	I'd like to see how close I am to a camera store and how close I am to a dirty dog grooming.
2071840	2079540	You're pretty close to a dirty dog grooming and there are five dirty dog grooming salons
2079540	2085360	in the city and you are also probably pretty near a camera shop.
2085880	2090640	Does John Peter's dirty dog loyalty card mention a specific location?
2090640	2091640	No.
2091640	2093520	Okay, so I'm going to head to the camera shop.
2093520	2095800	You get a call.
2095800	2099440	It is someone from the city police station.
2099440	2104440	Yeah, I think we actually clocked your suspect in a gown.
2104440	2110040	She seems to have just stolen a black SUV and is heading west on the highway.
2110040	2111040	All right.
2111400	2115200	Immediately, I think him and I kick my cruiser, like throw on my lights.
2115200	2118200	I don't give a shit about jurisdiction.
2118200	2120200	Hell yeah.
2120200	2123400	I'm going to chase her.
2123400	2124560	Yeah, I'm going to chase her down.
2124560	2125560	Sounds good.
2125560	2126560	She's heading for contention.
2126560	2131960	She's heading for contention, the officer says.
2131960	2133960	I know.
2133960	2136760	I'm from there.
2136760	2139960	You are going to roll drive for me.
2140880	2146880	36 on a more than that, on a 50, no, 70.
2146880	2147880	Okay, nice.
2147880	2153200	So you speed back into town and you don't catch up with her on the highway because it
2153200	2155360	seems she got a pretty good head start on you.
2155360	2161040	Blind with anger and a thirst for justice and answers.
2161040	2162680	The truth, really.
2162680	2169920	John Lee Pettymore completely spaces the fourth, completely spaces that he should, he should
2169920	2173360	definitely tell the town that this lady is coming.
2173360	2178320	You were just eyes red, just fucking flying down the highway.
2178320	2179800	You roll into contention.
2179800	2184440	You drive straight down the main road, right down to the police station.
2184440	2192200	And as you get there, I need you to roll me an alertness check.
2192200	2194200	My luckier dice.
2198200	2199200	14.
2199480	2201080	Hell yeah.
2201080	2207720	As you're driving down this main drag and pulling up to the police department, you see,
2207720	2211720	well first your radio goes off and it's Clark Bishop.
2211720	2213280	We got a situation down here guys.
2213280	2214280	Come on.
2214280	2215280	Uh, oh shit.
2215280	2216280	Uh, fuck.
2216280	2218160	Uh, we got a, we got a, uh, a wreck in the parking lot.
2218160	2221240	There's a, uh, a guy's just taken off gun in hand.
2221240	2222520	Leo's in a, in a black SUV.
2222520	2224320	I didn't catch the damn plate.
2224320	2226320	I need, I need some help down here guys.
2226320	2232040	You actually see this black SUV driving east from the police station.
2232040	2239080	You see Leo piston in the driver's seat of this SUV with a horrified look on his face.
2239080	2244240	And you see the barrel of a pistol pressed firmly against the back of Leo piston's head.
2244240	2246240	Go ahead and roll sanity for me.
2246240	2247240	Okay.
2247240	2249440	I passed 54 and a 59.
2249440	2250440	Okay.
2250440	2251440	So you lose no sanity.
2251440	2253200	You were like ready to go.
2253200	2255200	I'd peel out after him.
2255200	2256200	Fuck yeah.
2256200	2273080	I'm the only one trying to fool.
2273080	2296960	How can you have enough drowning out all the notes.
