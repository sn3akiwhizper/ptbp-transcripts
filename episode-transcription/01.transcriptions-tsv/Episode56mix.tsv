0	6040	Welcome, my flock. It's your pastor, Wolf the Dog, and I'm here to give you a sermon
6040	11960	about the merits of garbage collection. We are the only trash-based ministry that will
11960	21680	broadcast you all live from 694.2 PTBP. I pray for y'all every day, hoping that a bounty
21680	29560	of trash will fill your bellies, as it always does mine. For some reason, my producer keeps
29600	36440	yapping on about how it's December the 6th or something, and it's about, like, 4 PM or
36440	42240	something thereabouts. I don't know. I just wish he'd stop yammering.
42240	48980	Time means nothing in the house of the Lord. Wolf bless you, my children, and Wolf bless
48980	54560	this mess. It's a new Howlin' with Wolf. This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from
54560	61360	AtMeganIsANerd, who tweeted about the show way back in September. She writes,
61360	68060	Dear Mr. Wolf, While my fellow agents and I were investigating some issues in contention,
68060	73600	we became trapped in some kind of temporal anomaly. My colleagues have been scattered
73600	80280	to the four winds of time, and your broadcast seems to be the only constant. To Chad, Drew,
80280	85960	and Sabrina, if you can hear this, I hope you catch up to my timeline soon so we can
85960	91960	properly theorize about what the hell is going on here. Looking forward to catching your
91960	96560	house with a full pack soon, Mr. Wolf. From Megan.
96560	104840	Well, Megan, my voice has been known to permeate through time and space. I beckon, but only
104840	112440	a scant few hear the call. I know Chad, Drew, and Sabrina will hear your message, because
112440	117640	any chosen will hear a message when I so command it of the cosmos.
117640	124000	Haha, but anyway, I do truly hope your friends find you instead of being caught in some sort
124000	129240	of horrible alternate timeline from which there is no return. Remember, if you want
129240	134360	to write up something for your wolf to hout, tag at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter.
134360	139600	I've pretended to be people on Facebook. Fuck you, Zuckmarkerberg. Or write a five-star

153240	160680	unlocks access to seven exclusive bonus episodes. The most recent one is a Q&A episode.
160680	166200	Zach discusses his campaign notes. Justin reveals his relationship with me, Wolf the
166200	171780	Dog, but I don't know who that motherfucker is, y'all. Luke and Thomas come up with names
171780	178280	for Contention's Army Surplus store, and Joe tells the story of a legitimate alien sighting.
178280	184940	So legitimate, in fact, it could be up next in the news. The perhaps second iterations
184940	190600	of the formal Contention police officers got an address and phone number for the target.
190600	198440	The co-founder and current majority shareholder of BarCorp, Bruce Robin. Maggie Cook tossed
198440	205120	them a folder full of information about BarCorp, including a connection to Jesus Christ Ministries,
205120	210080	the $2 billion projected gross profits for next year, and the listings for the other
210080	216480	three entities with the highest stake in BarCorp. Stacey Beans, Francis Beans, and The Mill
216480	222360	on the other side of the city, and then she burned John Lee Pettymore and dipped. Our
222360	228880	terrible protagonist went to the downtown brownstone of Bruce Robin, a once respectable
228880	243820	home and current shithole. The number 811-818-9520-1311-811 fuck. I feel like a piece of chicken that
243820	251600	wasn't properly tenderized, brined, and marinated, and no one wants to eat me, not even the dog.
251600	258160	Wolf spit me out. I'm swept up, thrown in the trash. I am nothing. At the landfill,
258160	263520	I land on a plastic bag named Phil. She's sweet, but I can't provide nutrients to a
263520	272440	fucking piece of plastic. Can I, Phyllis Theodora Festerbone III? Fucking no, I cannot. But
272440	277840	what I can do is drop the beat that makes you bleat. It's kudzu with no backbone.
288160	313160	Oh man. Another week. Another doll hair? You're not gonna trick me with that again. Oh my
313160	319880	gosh, guys. Wait, if this is episode 56, I think it's our year anniversary. Really? Or maybe last
319880	326320	week was. So the date that we released the first three... December 2nd, I believe. So I looked it
326320	333440	up. My podcast app says November 18th. Yes, so the first episode got released because I submitted it
333440	338560	to iTunes for approval, and then they just uploaded it as soon as they got approved. So then we did
338800	343720	our official launch later. Okay, I'm glad that you said that because it was incongruous in my brain
343720	349680	that I was sure that we had our launch in December. Yeah. Okay, that makes sense now. Yeah, yeah. I was
349680	354080	actually thinking about this. Do you want to put out a special one-year episode where we just party
354080	359960	on Mike? Mike party. Mike party. Who's Mike party? You are now. I know that guy. What was Mike party
359960	367520	sound like, Joe? He's Mike party! Mike party here. Hope you're all having a good time. I brought
367560	375680	cocaine. So you guys are making your way to Bar Corp, and you're driving through the city,
375680	381800	which again, just this like sickly thickness hanging in the air, and you see these flowers
381800	386440	everywhere. I want to touch it. Oh, you touch the sickness? Actually, you put your hand outside the
386440	390880	window and you feel like physical resistance when you put it out, but it's probably just the wind.
390880	399360	Physics roll, please. None of you have a science, I would assume. You don't strike me as characters
399360	405920	who would be good at science. I have a 0% in it. Same. I bet John Lee Pettymore would have been
405920	411400	good at science, but he definitely can't roll for it. Well, he was like, there was one teacher who
411400	416320	tried to reach out to him in like ninth grade. Biology, man. Yeah. He said, I just want to
416320	420960	reach cars. Mr. Yeah. Mr. Hawkins just couldn't get through. John, at this point in your life,
420960	426200	you're going to go in one of two different directions. You can't just keep turning left
426200	430960	all the time. I was thinking more of like a robot voice since you said Hawkins. John,
430960	438360	like there's two paths that you can take at this point. I'm such an idiot. And nevermind.
438360	447680	I don't get it. You can't just turn left your whole life. You are an idiot. Jesus. Yeah. Luke
447680	453320	Hawkins is the town from Stranger Things. I was trying to go there. I was like, I can't think of
453320	461760	a Stranger Things. I love you. You're the person who thinks his name is Stephen Hawkins. I realized
461760	467600	as soon as I've said it twice that I've got no response from the room. I was like, fuck,
467600	476960	I am stupid. Hawkins. Hawkins. Hawkins. Don't you guys get my joke? Hawkins. Oh my God. Hear every
476960	485600	dumb ass I went to high school with. I'm method acting Keith. Maybe too much. Yeah, you've been
485600	498480	doing that your whole life. Can Keith Vigna do a pull up? Sure. Yeah. No. Keith Vigna. My
498480	505840	strength's 55. Oh shit. That's not great. That's below average. That's above average. Yeah. It's
505840	515200	five above average. I stand by it. So you guys are going to Bar Corp and the city is gross and
515360	520560	there's flowers and Luke's an idiot. Yep. And there's a thickness in the air. And I love him.
520560	526560	I love you. I love you too. So is this going to be the tallest building in the city? No, but it is
526560	533520	17 stories high from what you can tell. As you pull up, you see the whole front is just covered
533520	540000	in glass all the way from the bottom to the top. It's beautiful. And you can see as you're walking
540000	548080	in, there are marble columns and the entry, the foyer that you see after you pass through the fun
548080	554960	circular turnstile at the bottom leading into a large lobby. It's so fun. I'll go through it
554960	562720	twice. Clark Bishop wearing an old seventies or eighties contention PD uniform goes through the
562720	569760	turnstile twice. Keith Wigner looks down at himself. I just realized, yeah, I do not look
569760	575360	like a cop, right? Yeah. We did want to roll into here looking like cops. Can we go to a thrift
575360	581200	store? I guess and get some blue windbreakers. Okay. We spray paint the FBI on the backs.
582880	589360	Let's cut to that montage right now. Oh, that's fun. Oh, they're having fun.
590320	596960	I put on a sparkly boa and I'm like, everyone's got their arms crossed and they shake their head.
596960	604080	No, you come back with a tiara and they're all like two thumbs up. So what are you guys wearing?
604080	608880	A blue windbreaker. You know how, when you go to a thrift store, sometimes you'll just find like
608880	614000	seven of the same like shitty company. It can be a windbreaker. It can be a t-shirt or whatever.
614000	619520	They all have that like gray cottony cloth on the inside. Yeah. Okay. So we found three blue
619520	624960	ones of those that are just blank. Um, could have been for a sports team. Yeah. You, you find,
624960	630400	yeah, you find them there. They're all, they all fit you well, pretty nondescript. So you can make
630400	635360	them look however you would like to make them look. Then I also, I grabbed any cowboy hat I
635360	640640	find there and throw it on. Nice. I grabbed one of those obviously fake police hat.
641520	649040	It's from a Halloween costume. I put that on. It's got the plastic with no words on it.
652320	656640	Yeah. That'll help. Yeah. I have that on and then I'd keep all my other clothes on. Yeah.
656640	661040	I'm keeping my uniform on it and just putting the windbreaker over it. Okay. So Keith Vigna,
661040	667360	describe what you're wearing. I think big like cargo shorts. I think they're teal, teal,
667440	673360	big cargo shorts, a like bright orange polo. I believe that's correct. Sparey's boat shoes
673360	679680	with a Halloween cop hat and a blue windbreaker. Maybe we should address your bottom layers too,
679680	686080	Keith. It's December and it's gotten pretty cold. So you've got goose pimples all over your shins,
686080	693440	baby. Uh, looking around, I find goose pimples, like a Carhartt one piece long sleeve that is
693440	697440	connected to the pants too. You know what I'm talking about? I put that on. Overalls?
698240	705040	Well, coveralls. Yeah. Oh, gotcha. Gotcha. They cover your overalls. The full thing. I put those
705040	709920	on and some boots. Okay. With a blue windbreaker and are you keeping the hat? I'm keeping the hat
709920	714240	and then I just ditch the clothes that I came in. So you're just, you're just free and easy
714240	719600	underneath. Free and easy under my coveralls. You put the clothes that you were wearing onto the
719600	726640	rack. That's how you think this works. This is a take a penny, leave a penny store, right?
726640	733040	Exactly. Everything you bought was yellow tag and it just happens to be 50% off yellow tag day.
733040	739920	Fucking love. Now to the 17th floor. Now immediately standing exactly where you were
739920	747280	before, but wearing what you're wearing now, Clark, Keith, Pettymore, you guys show up to
747280	752400	the headquarters of Bar Corp. Is there anyone in the lobby? There is no one in the lobby except for
753040	760960	a security guard and a secretary sitting at a large marble desk on the far end from you.
760960	769760	And behind them, there's an extremely large mural painted on the wall. And it is the painting of
769760	777040	George Washington crossing the Delaware, except for replacing all the guns are flowers.
777600	781840	Was there signage on this building as we walked in? Do they advertise that they are headquartered
781840	787680	here? No. Is there a directory like by an elevator or something? 17th floor. I mean,
787680	792800	just to see if this is only Bar Corp or if there's other stuff in this building. There is a directory
792800	798560	and you would see that the floors are separated into different departments within Bar Corp,
798560	805200	but they are all under the umbrella. Is there a Jesus Christ Ministries part here? There is.
805200	810480	What else was under in that envelope that we'd found? It was Jesus Christ Ministries
810480	816560	Health and Rehabilitation Unlimited and the Learning Center. Can I, I don't know if it's
816560	821360	a role or just a knowledge that Clark would have, but reading the directory, are there any
821360	827040	businesses or institutions that spring out as that's a contention thing that we know for sure
827040	830880	contention has one of this company? Well, this is where the clinker's corporate headquarters are.
833600	839200	No, you would not recognize any of these names from your small town of contention. And what is
839200	843760	the 17th floor? What is it described as? It's actually not on the directory. Does it stop at
843760	848720	16 or does it stop even before that? It stops at 12. Is the elevator somewhere we can just go
848720	853920	up to it? Yeah. I want to, I want to flash my badge at the security guard. We've got an
853920	860400	appointment with Winifred Worth. We're on our way up. Role persuade or law or bureaucracy?
863520	872080	Uh, 47 on a 60 for persuade. The silent security guard motions that that is okay and the secretary
872080	877440	sitting nearby is too busy looking at the computer screen to even pay attention. Does she have a
877440	884320	name tag? A place? The doctor is actually a man. The what? Oh, the doctor is actually a man.
884320	902960	Does this, uh, that doesn't make any sense. The secretary was his dad. Oh, that was really dumb.
902960	908640	Do they have a placard? She has a placard. Yeah. What's her, what's her name? Uh, it's not
908640	913520	Winifred. It's kind of what I was saying. Oh no. It's a ginger Evans. Cool. That's a pretty hot
913520	919600	name. Uh, is there a button for the 17th floor in the elevator? When you go into the elevator,
919600	926960	you see that there are buttons for one through 12. Uh, you guys just want to go to 12 and I assume
926960	931200	take some stairs up then or we could ask that security. Yeah. I guess I just want to be like,
931200	934880	Hey buddy, we're supposed to be on the 17th floor. This only goes up to 12.
934880	940320	He points to the, it's a different elevator. Grazie. And I've been learning Italian.
941440	943280	Did that come with the Kevin body? Did it?
945360	948080	You know, no, I mean, John Lee Pettymore has mysteries that
949840	957200	is a rich inner life. As you go into the elevator that he points you to, as the door closes,
957200	962000	you hear, uh, as he gets on a little, uh, walkie talkie. Do we hear what he says?
962000	968800	He initiated it. Yeah. Gotcha. And, uh, this elevator has 14 through 17 listed.
968800	976720	17, 17. They already clicked the button Clark. I mean, you still have time as it goes up.
978720	982640	Is there any advantage to maybe not going straight to the top,
982640	989120	maybe walking at the 16th and then we could definitely, uh, we could go through all 16
989120	993200	other floors first. Really make sure we've done a search role for everything. You guys are going
993200	999120	to have to kill so many people. You've got that prepared, right? You've got, you've got all,
999120	1004800	all 16 floors just started out. Oh yeah. I make stats for everybody.
1007120	1009680	You better have some fucking stats for Winifred worth.
1012640	1020320	She's about to get in some combat. Do you want to try to go up the stairs to the last one or
1020320	1024480	just come right out? I just thought it out there. It's a part of the, maybe an element of surprise
1024480	1028880	is they don't see the elevator doors open with us in it. Yeah. I mean, but our, since we're dressed
1028880	1034640	up, since we are cops and also dressed up as far as, yeah, we're above board for now. Oh guys,
1034640	1042080	we just reached the 17th floor and the door opens and standing directly in front of the elevator
1042080	1054080	doors mows you down is a woman. She is small in stature. She has shock white hair. She is wearing
1054080	1064000	a very dope outfit. Her blouse is white satin and the left half is black striped vertically.
1064720	1071680	Her pants are the same material, high-waisted and one of her pant legs on the opposite side.
1071920	1076000	The right side is stripped. It's striped backwards. So yeah, they're catty corner.
1076000	1086160	And then she is wearing white platform shoes that have studs all around the sole and on her hands,
1086160	1093520	which she has folded neatly together. She has silver rings and it seems to actually just be one
1093520	1099280	big ring that wraps in and out of her fingers. Would you say that she would brass knuckles
1099280	1104240	almost like brass knuckles? Would she be trying to procure 101 Dalmatians?
1109680	1113360	I expected you. Can I get a sense of age? She is either
1114320	1120560	58 or a really, really good 72 type or somewhere in between.
1120560	1127440	Gotcha. There's no fucking way she's 73, Joe. She couldn't be the way she looks.
1127440	1132480	How old are you Winifred? That's exactly not the
1132480	1138160	question that I expected to come out of your mouth first, but I am 71.
1138160	1139840	Damn, you was right. That's about what I figured.
1142480	1147520	How long have you been working for Mr. Beans? I'm sorry. What is your business here?
1147520	1152720	Well, ma'am, I think it's pretty obvious from our very official windbreakers that we're the police.
1152720	1159280	Yes, from contention. Yeah, our buddy here has a, you know, he wants to commiserate.
1159280	1163520	Beans, sorry for you, I suppose. That's what you'd like to be known as these days.
1163520	1169200	I don't know what you're talking about. Rolled disguise.
1172480	1181040	Damn, 32 on a 30. I can see right through whatever she looks at you.
1181120	1183600	This is... And Clark Bishop.
1183600	1186320	Ma'am. And then she looks back at Keith.
1186320	1190560	So, do you have the list of questions for me? You don't know who I am?
1190560	1195120	I assume you're someone. Is that correct? More or less.
1195120	1199120	You don't know him, but you know me. How do you know my name?
1199120	1203520	The internet? Vast. So much knowledge. Just at your fingertips.
1203520	1205520	What'd you do? Google Keith's friends? Yep.
1206160	1211680	I want to Google that in my smartphone real quick and see what's coming up.
1211680	1218160	It's a picture of Clark Bishop and it says, John Lee Pettymore is no longer my best friend.
1221120	1225040	Friendship with John Lee Pettymore ended. Vigga is my new friend.
1228160	1231600	Yes, I don't know all the memes, but I got your name from that.
1232240	1234560	You like that Baby Yoda meme? I'm unaware.
1235040	1236240	He's a little cute rascal.
1236240	1241120	Well, we're just going to go ahead and go on in there and talk to Bruce.
1241120	1245200	Well, first off, if you'd like to hand me the questions that you have prepared.
1245200	1245840	Top secret.
1247360	1251280	Police business, ma'am. This isn't a friendly call. It's a work call.
1251280	1254480	While they're talking, I want to look around this floor we're on and see,
1255520	1257760	are we the only ones here with her? Yes.
1257760	1259920	Yeah. It's not like a busy office.
1259920	1270320	This has a long hallway and the floor is marble and the walls are lined with similar murals
1270320	1274800	as the one that you saw upon your entry. They are Renaissance America.
1274800	1279120	Wait, what is that time period called in America? The early.
1279120	1281920	The Renaissance? I like just said a word.
1281920	1284720	Revolutionary. There wasn't an America.
1285280	1289520	He's asking what you call that type of art that Crossing the Delaware is, which I don't know.
1289520	1290000	Boring.
1297200	1299680	That word. Colonial? Is it colonial art?
1300400	1302560	Thomas doesn't know, but he knows it's not that.
1303840	1307520	There's a lot of different American painting schools.
1308240	1309120	Sure. It's one of them.
1310080	1311920	Are they all flowered?
1311920	1312240	Yes.
1313760	1316960	So we can't come up with the name of that time period, but they're all that time period?
1316960	1317520	Yes.
1317520	1324800	I want to gesture to her almost conspiratorially and nod to take her off to the side.
1325840	1331760	Listen, ma'am, he's just absolutely torn up to hell about his brother and he thinks that
1333040	1336080	Mr. Robin's the only person in the world who might understand.
1337120	1341040	Can you see it in your heart to let him ask these questions personally?
1341040	1342720	And I'd like to try to persuade her.
1342720	1347360	Yeah. I'm going to have you roll against her instead of at a disadvantage.
1347520	1350240	Fuck.
1350240	1352160	She passed with a 26.
1352160	1353360	I passed, but with an eight.
1353360	1355680	Which would have been great if this wasn't contested.
1355680	1359040	She whispers up into your ear.
1359040	1361440	That's very well and good, sir.
1362240	1370560	However, you don't have any jurisdiction here and I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
1370560	1374400	So now I want to push her to the ground and run right past her.
1374400	1375520	Oh shit.
1375520	1375920	Okay.
1375920	1377840	Roll unarmed combat for me.
1381600	1382720	Fuck. Is this contested?
1382720	1384400	Yep. She passed with a 17.
1384960	1386320	Oh, that's what he got.
1386320	1387600	I rolled a 17.
1387600	1389280	Ty goes to the pusher.
1389280	1393280	Yay!
1393680	1396080	I was so fucking bummed when I rolled that.
1396080	1397280	I was like, damn it.
1399680	1401600	Did you fucking really roll 17?
1401600	1401920	Yeah.
1401920	1403040	Hell yeah, dude.
1403040	1403760	Why would you lie?
1408320	1410080	Oh yeah. None of us do that.
1410080	1412400	I don't hide my rolls from you guys.
1412400	1414080	I just sit far enough away.
1415920	1419920	So describe what you push with.
1421760	1426720	I, I give her a look like, I am so sorry, ma'am.
1427360	1430560	And then I just like fucking suplex her to the ground.
1432000	1432560	Run.
1432560	1436560	And I, I see this happen and I run towards where I think the office is.
1436560	1437760	It's just the door at the end of the hallway.
1439600	1440720	Big double doors.
1440720	1448000	As they take off running, I look down at her and I kind of do a half-hearted shrug and follow.
1448000	1451760	Thomas, if you could roll a D6 for damage.
1454320	1457920	It's the only time I'm going to lie about a roll and say, I got a one, I got a four.
1463040	1466640	As he hears like something crack, he's like, I'm so sorry.
1466640	1468880	We're really hoping she looked bad for 50.
1469440	1474240	You put her down right on her hip and just hear like a snap crunch.
1475440	1477360	Basically, this got really sad.
1478400	1480080	The good news is she ain't getting up.
1487120	1491520	Well, maybe you should have let a grieving man talk to the only person in the world who
1491520	1492480	would understand.
1492480	1494000	I am truly sorry though.
1494000	1495360	And I run off after him.
1495360	1497360	I don't think you're truly sorry.
1497360	1502400	I think you're white claw sorry because you're adhering to no laws.
1502400	1505360	I'm spend drift tired of your shit.
1507520	1508240	I'm sorry.
1508240	1509200	Sorry about that, ma'am.
1509200	1511840	And we'll get an ambulance on its way, but we got to do it.
1512720	1514080	And I just keep walking by.
1514080	1514480	Okay.
1514480	1518240	She pulls out her phone and dials 911.
1518240	1522080	I kicked that out of her hands and I'm like, I'm so sorry, ma'am.
1522880	1526560	I'm going to do the dialing because I don't think you're just going to call the hospital.
1526560	1528240	I think you're going to call the police on us.
1528240	1528640	Okay.
1528640	1531600	And I show her that like, I'm calling 911 too.
1531600	1532400	And I'm like, you know what?
1532400	1537280	You can tell them anything you want once they get here, but we need a few minutes with Mr.
1537280	1537680	Robin.
1537680	1539440	911, what's your emergency?
1539440	1540960	Oh my God.
1540960	1545120	My mother just fell on the 17th floor of the bar court building.
1545120	1546160	Bar court building.
1546160	1547280	She broke her damn hip.
1547280	1550880	You need to get here fast or, you know, take your time.
1550880	1552080	She's a tough old bean.
1552080	1556320	Sir, if you could stay on the line for me, what's the address of the bar court building?
1556320	1559200	Oh, it's a 501 East fake street.
1559200	1560800	And what is your name, sir?
1562080	1563280	Keith Vigna.
1563280	1565200	And what is your mother's name, sir?
1566320	1567440	Winifred Worth.
1567440	1569760	Sir, we have people on their way right now.
1569760	1575920	If you could stay on the line with me, I'd like to ask you a couple more questions.
1575920	1577360	You just say beep into the phone.
1577360	1578800	I say beep and hang up.
1579440	1580160	Sir, you're still...
1582560	1584400	Sir, I heard you say beep.
1584400	1584720	Okay.
1584720	1591680	So you make your way to the end of the hall and I need whoever has the highest alertness
1591680	1592960	to roll alertness.
1592960	1594000	I've got 60.
1594000	1594960	Got a 70.
1594960	1598960	Clark Bishop rolling alertness.
1598960	1602240	Gonna get some dice with numbers on them.
1602320	1608640	You turn around to see Winifred pull out another cell phone from her other pocket.
1609680	1610480	Winnie.
1610480	1611520	Winnie now.
1611520	1612080	Darling.
1612080	1613840	Also, I told you, you need to stand up, Winnie.
1619920	1625280	Well, we'll talk to her for one sentence and then we'll just push her on the ground.
1625920	1626960	Well, you made us do it.
1628160	1629600	I didn't feel like that.
1629600	1630320	You wanted it.
1632400	1634080	You set this whole situation up.
1634080	1634080	
1634080	1635120	I'm so sorry.
1635120	1640160	I don't know why you would push a nice old lady who's just trying to do her job.
1640160	1643680	Ma'am, frankly, I'm real sorry about your hip.
1643680	1644080	I am.
1644080	1648880	But there's some extra worldly shit going on and your boss might be involved in it.
1648880	1652960	And we're just trying to literally save the fucking earth starting with our town in this
1652960	1653360	city.
1653360	1657680	So I mean, I'm sure you've got great medical through Bar Corps.
1657680	1659600	You're the fucking CEOs.
1659840	1663280	There are three men here and they have pushed me to the ground.
1663280	1664160	I kick it out of her.
1665840	1667360	No, no, no, Winnie.
1668080	1668480	Damn it.
1669200	1671200	Can we be friends here?
1671200	1672560	After all this?
1672560	1673680	Let's start again.
1675200	1676000	Yeah, fuck Winnifred.
1676000	1679040	I'm at the double doors and I'm like, guys, get the fuck over here.
1679040	1679680	Come on.
1679680	1681360	The doors are locked.
1681360	1683200	I have lock picking.
1683200	1684960	Oh, that might be useful.
1684960	1686160	I'd also like to search.
1686720	1688240	I got a 45 on a 50.
1688240	1689680	Winnifred for the keys.
1689680	1690720	Does she have a desk?
1690720	1692320	No, there's no desk in this hallway.
1692320	1692640	Okay.
1692640	1695280	I'm looking at her, like her eyeballs and her fingerprints.
1695280	1696560	And I'm like, what if she is the key?
1699200	1704960	It's actually normally pubic hair that gets you into different locations, just right under
1704960	1705520	the armpit.
1705520	1706400	I picked the lock.
1706400	1707040	Pick the lock.
1707040	1713360	And Thomas John, Kevin Lee Pettymore hears the door open as you're going toward Winnifred
1713360	1715600	to try to find the keys on her.
1715600	1717520	I'd still like to do a search rule on her.
1717520	1720240	I want to frisk her for any other cell phones.
1720240	1721680	Okay, go ahead and roll search.
1723120	1723620	Fail.
1724000	1724320	Okay.
1724320	1725920	You don't find her third cell phone.
1727920	1728800	Wily old bat.
1728800	1734720	You open one of these double doors into a large office in a state of slight chaos.
1734720	1739920	To your right, there's a wall entirely comprised of a single large bookcase that seems to have
1739920	1744880	been recently fingered through books at a time, some of which have been left scattered
1744880	1747280	about the reading area haphazardly.
1747280	1754320	To your left, a conference table with eight chairs is completely overrun with file folders,
1754320	1756400	large binders, and loose papers.
1757040	1764080	Ahead of you is a large desk in a similar condition and five deep button high back to
1764080	1772400	leather chairs that sit in a half circle facing the desk and the panicked, pacing man behind
1772400	1777680	it, jerkily moving back and forth in front of the large window that makes up the back
1777680	1784400	wall of this office, giving you all a bird's eye view of the city somehow both lackluster
1784400	1785520	and rancid.
1786080	1789200	Bruce Robin is muttering to himself.
1789760	1793120	He's wearing a black nothing.
1794880	1796080	A black nothing.
1797600	1799600	He's wearing black pants.
1799600	1800320	How do they fit?
1800320	1801120	Just right.
1801120	1802080	Well tailored.
1802080	1802960	These pants.
1803520	1812480	And a white shirt, no tie, top button unbuttoned, and a crushed red velvet like burgundy smoking
1812480	1813040	jacket.
1813040	1820320	And his hair is all askew just like mop style all over his head and it doesn't suit his
1820320	1822320	face or the way that he is dressed.
1822960	1826400	I need you all to roll alertness, all three of you.
1828000	1828720	Fail.
1828720	1829220	Fail.
1830960	1831460	Pass.
1831940	1833220	62 on a 70.
1833220	1836820	You can hear him very faintly under his breath.
1837780	1841860	Hey, hey, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
1841860	1849460	8-1-1-8-1-8-9-5-2-0-1-3-1-1-8-1-1-1-9.
1849460	1851780	Yeah, yeah, Bruce likey, yeah.
1852900	1854340	Mr. Robin?
1854340	1854900	Yeah.
1854900	1860500	And he turns and he's like, oh, yeah, yeah, what are you guys, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
1860500	1861300	what are you guys doing?
1861460	1863380	Hey, what are you guys doing up here?
1863380	1865300	Well, we came to talk to you, sir.
1865300	1867220	What were those numbers you were just muttering?
1867220	1867860	I heard that.
1867860	1869300	What were those?
1869300	1870020	Roll human.
1873300	1874900	That's a fail.
1874900	1876100	Can we all roll?
1876100	1876420	Yeah.
1876420	1876900	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1878020	1878660	Fail.
1878660	1879160	I pass.
1879860	1880980	47 on 80.
1880980	1882180	You got 80, human?
1882180	1882580	Yeah.
1882580	1883460	Fuck yeah, dude.
1885460	1885940	Numbers.
1887060	1887780	I know.
1887780	1890900	8-1-1-8, you know, you just said it.
1891460	1892900	No, no numbers for me.
1892900	1897060	8-1-1-8-1-8-1-9-5-2-0-1-3-1-1-8-1-1-1-9.
1898660	1899140	Yeah.
1899140	1901940	No, Bruce no likey, Bruce no likey.
1901940	1903700	Well, you just said Bruce did likey.
1904420	1904980	No.
1904980	1905700	Come on, come on.
1905700	1909940	Hey, guys, come on, come on over here and sit down, sit down in these chairs right here.
1909940	1913220	Yeah, come on, Bruce likey if you sit down here.
1913220	1915540	I'm actually very comfortable standing, sir.
1915540	1917220	Yeah, Clark doesn't take a seat either.
1917220	1925460	He immediately walks over and there is a glass on his desk, like a rocks glass,
1925460	1930260	and he picks it up and he holds it in his hand with like white knuckles and he walks
1930260	1936340	toward you guys and he's like, I think maybe you should just probably just sit in the seats,
1936340	1936660	right?
1936660	1938740	Yeah, yeah, we can talk, yeah.
1938740	1940420	Clark puts his hand on his gun.
1940420	1944340	No, no, no, no, no, no, there's no need for any of that business here.
1944340	1947780	Then you can put that glass down and step back behind the desk there.
1947780	1950180	All right, well, come on down, come on down.
1950180	1956180	And he walks over to his desk and he kind of slides across the top of it to go sit on
1956180	1956980	the other side.
1956980	1957540	Cool.
1957540	1964500	I'll walk over directly facing him.
1964500	1972820	So he just like a fat kid getting out of a pool, just like sets his belly down on the
1972820	1979540	desk and then like slowly tips over and then pops up and rotates around to the side.
1980820	1983700	Although Keith goes and sits at the chair.
1983700	1986500	Yeah, yeah, Bruce Leicke, yeah, do that.
1986500	1988820	I'll stand near a chair, but I'm not going to sit in it.
1988820	1993060	I'm going to stand behind the chair that Keith's in, kind of with my like hand on the,
1993060	1995380	not on my shoulders, but like on the top of the chair.
1995380	1997540	Hand shoes and horse grenades, I'll take it.
1997540	1999220	Yeah, yeah, all right, well.
2000180	2004180	Can I do a check that we're not standing on like a trap door?
2004180	2005620	Oh, sure.
2005620	2007540	Zach's like, ooh, there is a trap door.
2009060	2010100	Roll dexterity.
2010660	2012820	No, you can roll search, I guess.
2012820	2014260	I was afraid you were going to say that and I don't have it.
2014260	2016420	20% for you, sir.
2016420	2018260	I fail, 97.
2018260	2022820	You don't seem to be standing anywhere except for right next to a very comfy chair.
2022820	2023140	Okay.
2023140	2024180	Do you know who I am?
2024180	2025300	He just stares at you.
2025300	2026740	You can answer his question, Bruce.
2029220	2042980	You're not, you're not with, and you notice as he's just like pondering your question,
2043620	2048820	blood on his knuckles, like from a cut or scrape or something, or from punching.
2048820	2050260	And which one?
2050260	2051060	Oh, you don't know.
2051060	2054900	I mean, it would be just kind of red and cut up.
2054900	2061540	He's also wearing a silver ring with a blank, flat top on his middle finger on his left hand.
2061540	2063140	Is that something we've seen before?
2063140	2069220	Yeah, I, I, I, I, I nod, I motion with my head and eyes at Keith and John at the ring.
2070260	2071940	It looks like one of those rings I found.
2071940	2074660	Is that one of the rings that we found at?
2074660	2075460	Jim Cook's house.
2075460	2075860	Okay.
2075860	2076900	And when you rubbed it.
2076900	2078180	Light came out of it or something?
2078180	2079620	Or when you put it on, I think.
2079620	2080580	Oh, the M.
2080580	2083540	It was the M made out of four double helices.
2083540	2084660	Double helix, yeah.
2085540	2089300	You were at Jim Cook's house when I got pushed through the wall.
2089300	2090020	Yeah, it was in there.
2090020	2091620	It was in the kitchen or in the kitchen.
2091620	2091940	Yeah.
2091940	2096020	Well, I mean, I found it in the bathroom, but then I laid it on the counter when I left.
2096020	2097700	And then we came back and looked at it.
2097700	2098200	Yeah, I did.
2098740	2102260	Wait, I have that around my neck on a chain.
2102260	2102820	You do.
2102820	2104500	Yeah, you do.
2106500	2107540	Show him the goddamn ring.
2107540	2112500	Yeah, I, I take it off like the necklace part and I just kind of show it to him,
2112500	2113700	but I don't say anything.
2113700	2116900	His eyes get massive.
2116900	2118740	In an excited way or a scared way?
2118740	2119460	Both.
2119460	2122820	And he is very careful with his words.
2122820	2126100	Are you, uh, are you with?
2127300	2127940	I'm so sorry.
2130980	2131620	Jon does that.
2133380	2133780	He waves.
2133780	2134900	He's like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
2138580	2140980	I was waving off Zach like, don't get too far into that.
2144340	2148260	Marietta say yes.
2148260	2148740	I nod.
2149300	2149780	Okay.
2151220	2154100	Well, if it's coming, let it happen.
2156420	2160900	And he sits down in the chair behind the desk, kind of hangs his head.
2160900	2162660	Marietta was that robot company.
2162660	2164100	They made the androids.
2164100	2164580	Yeah.
2164580	2166020	We found a file in Jim.
2166660	2167620	Do I do this in character?
2167620	2168660	No, you out of character.
2168660	2170660	We can just talk about what you guys know about Marietta.
2170660	2174180	We found all those folders in Jim Cook's secret room in his house.
2174180	2179220	And folder one was called operation stapler and it had the M helix.
2179220	2181540	And we figured out that that meant myriad.
2181540	2186580	And it had to do with the respecking androids to cut down on costs to sell to other companies.
2186580	2188020	And that's when we also found.
2188020	2188180	Yeah.
2188180	2191220	We also saw the same M logo hole puncher.
2191220	2194340	Well, yes, that's when we learned about hole puncher and some other things.
2194340	2199300	But we also saw the myriad logo on the Android who attacked us outside of, uh,
2199300	2199700	that's right.
2199700	2206100	It was on the, on the crotch of the James, the mill workers house and I've got the ring
2206100	2208020	that has that symbol on it as well.
2208020	2211220	Did it glow or something when I put it on or when I like rubbed it?
2211220	2214980	It was when you put it on because it didn't do anything for me when I found it originally,
2214980	2216180	but I never put it on.
2216180	2216820	Okay.
2216820	2219220	So at this point, what I'm just holding it.
2219220	2220100	Confirmed.
2220100	2223300	And when you say yes, I slipped the ring on.
2223300	2232980	With his head slumped down, tongue flitting back and forth across his top lip, Bruce
2232980	2240260	Robin's eyes shift up to stare past you through a messy curtain of unwashed hair.
2240900	2243700	And he begins chanting.
2243700	2253220	Towel alicorn, Towel alicorn, Towel alicorn, Towel alicorn, Towel alicorn, Towel alicorn.
2253220	2255540	I jump across the desk and punch him.
2255540	2255940	Okay.
2255940	2261060	So we are going to roll against each other dexterity.
2261060	2268180	However, I'm going to give you a plus 40 for your pulp Cthulhu talent that you took to
2268180	2269620	do combat first.
2269620	2270260	Oh, gotcha.
2270260	2270760	Cool.
2274260	2275300	Well, okay.
2275300	2276580	I succeed with a 50.
2279620	2281460	I crit pass a 33.
2281460	2282500	Yeah, baby.
2283460	2286340	The crit trumps the low, the fact that I'm still lower, right?
2286340	2287460	It absolutely does.
2287460	2288260	Yes.
2288260	2292820	I Superman leap across the desk, landing the punch in flight.
2294820	2298180	I think that's going to probably tackle the chair over and we'll be playing on the ground,
2298180	2300260	but I've knocked the fuck out of this dude's jaw.
2300260	2301860	Roll unarmed combat.
2304660	2310820	I pass a 47 on a 70.
2310820	2311700	I failed.
2311700	2315300	So roll a D six, a four.
2315300	2318260	As you tackle him, the chair tips over backwards.
2318260	2318580	Yes.
2318580	2320580	A punch from Clark Bishop is the exact same.
2320580	2322340	And you hear a snap as a sip.
2323620	2325140	That's the exact same damage.
2327860	2331460	As you tackle him to the floor, you actually see.
2332340	2333220	Oh, hi.
2334180	2338500	A pistol in his hand gets knocked just out of his reach.
2338500	2342580	And he had grabbed it underneath his desk with his head down.
2342580	2345860	Dude, I wanted to say, I was starting to haunt him.
2345860	2348740	Han and Greedo like gun at the table, but I didn't.
2348740	2350740	So I'm really glad you knocked that gun out of his hand.
2353780	2356900	As soon as that happens, I want to shut his talk box.
2356900	2358900	I want to jump over the desk as well.
2358900	2362100	And what I want to do is I want to try to stomp on his hand
2362100	2364420	and then pull the ring off of his hand as well.
2365060	2365540	Okay.
2365540	2372180	Uh, roll unarmed combat against him and I'll give him a negative 40 for being pinned.
2372180	2374740	Essentially, I got a hundred.
2374740	2375540	Oh shit.
2375540	2380100	When you go to stomp on his hand, he grabs the bottom of your foot and he just pushes
2380100	2382100	and you fall on your ass.
2382100	2382820	Oh no.
2382820	2388580	I want to grab anything I can, uh, a box of like tissues, maybe a tie that he took off.
2388900	2390180	Anything I can see.
2390180	2392260	And I want to just shove it in his mouth.
2392260	2394020	You can grab the tie that he took off.
2394020	2395380	It's on his desk.
2395380	2395780	Okay.
2395780	2399620	I want to, I want to try to just like throw that in his spell speaker.
2405060	2409460	All right, so you're going to roll strength against him and I'll give him a negative.
2410660	2412180	He passed with a 31.
2412180	2413620	I failed 54 out of 50.
2414260	2414580	Shit.
2414580	2415620	How we are cool.
2415620	2419700	And he keeps, he, he like keeps his teeth gritted together.
2419700	2422980	So you can't make it through his big old chompies.
2422980	2424660	Unclench your chompers.
2424660	2425620	Can I punch him again?
2427220	2428100	Uh, yes.
2428100	2431060	And he will actually go now.
2431060	2434660	So he's gonna make an attempt to get you off of him.
2434660	2435140	Okay.
2435140	2438660	Uh, so if you're going to punch him, he's going to roll on overcomded against you as well.
2438660	2439460	Contested me and you.
2439460	2439860	Yes, sir.
2439860	2440360	Okay.
2441860	2444980	But when you rear back to punch, he succeeds with a 51.
2444980	2445620	I fail.
2445620	2447940	So he simply gets you off.
2451220	2453220	That's a wrap on pretending to be people.
2453220	2454340	Thank you, Bruce.
2458740	2460020	Buy a Clark a drink first.
2460900	2462580	And he's gonna grab the gun.
2462580	2468100	So he, this round is able to grab the gun again.
2468100	2469140	He has it.
2469140	2471540	So it is Clark Bishop's turn.
2471540	2472580	He has the gun?
2472580	2473080	Yes.
2473940	2476340	And he is continuing his chant.
2476900	2478500	You can hear it right now in the background.
2481540	2482500	Is he standing?
2482500	2483620	No, he's still on the ground.
2483620	2485460	I think I just want to punch him again.
2485460	2485700	Yeah.
2485700	2489140	Just a real quick synopsis of what this looks like currently.
2489140	2495620	He's on his back on the back of the chair with his like head on the ground and his legs
2495620	2497460	like up in the air.
2497460	2503060	Keith is on his ass trying to recover from getting like brush hour two flipped on his
2503060	2510580	back and John Lee Pettymore is like straddling him trying to get this tie in his mouth.
2510580	2511220	Temporarily.
2511220	2515140	He's just like got a tie full of saliva that he's like shaking off his hands.
2517300	2518420	So you're going to go to punch him?
2519220	2520260	Is he holding the gun?
2520260	2521300	He is holding the gun.
2521300	2525620	I think I would, I mean, whatever, whatever role you need for, I would be keeping my hand
2525620	2527620	on his hand, keeping that gun away.
2527620	2527860	Okay.
2527860	2530980	So that'll be unarmed combat pin attempt.
2534580	2536580	I pass a 10.
2536580	2539940	I crit pass with an 11.
2539940	2540180	Shoot.
2540180	2542100	The gun merges into his hand.
2543780	2545300	Man becomes one with machine.
2546100	2547940	It's no longer possible to disarm him.
2547940	2548580	Keith Europe.
2548580	2550500	It is impossible to disarm him.
2550500	2551460	Oh, no.
2551460	2555860	No, he's got a real tight grip on the gun though.
2555860	2561700	And he is like far more maneuverable at this juncture for this round because of that critical
2561700	2562260	success.
2562260	2564900	I get up, I pull my gun out and I shoot him in the stomach.
2564900	2566260	Draw your gun, roll firearms.
2567460	2568580	64 and a 70.
2568580	2571220	Do you say anything terrible when you do this?
2571220	2573540	No, I just kind of, I see the gut.
2573540	2574260	I see the gun.
2575060	2578980	I see the gun waving around and just, I don't want to see Clark get shot.
2578980	2581700	I don't have the stomach for this kind of work.
2581700	2582180	No, I don't.
2582180	2583300	He says nothing cool.
2583300	2585780	He just reacts immediately and pops one.
2586820	2587940	Oh shit.
2587940	2592020	Blood splatters out and gets all over John Lee Petty more.
2593700	2595220	My new windbreaker.
2595220	2596740	Whose turn it is currently.
2599780	2601540	It was $2 and 50 cents.
2602740	2604100	Half off yellow tech.
2604260	2609380	Um, but 25, uh, it's new to you though.
2609380	2612740	Would I have time to talk to him in between a combat round?
2612740	2612980	Yeah.
2612980	2613780	Are you going to stay down?
2613780	2614500	Motherfucker.
2614500	2615620	You can answer our questions.
2618020	2620580	I want to just like smack him in the face with my pistol.
2620580	2621300	The bottom again.
2621300	2621540	Okay.
2621540	2624100	I actually, I forgot to have Luke roll damage.
2624100	2626580	So roll a D for damage.
2626580	2628580	Unless you, did you grab at this point?
2629220	2632820	Do I have my tiny gun or do I just have a service pistol?
2632820	2633860	You have your tiny gun.
2634660	2636340	Do I have a service pistol as well?
2636340	2636820	Yes.
2636820	2638820	I want to shoot him with just a regular pistol.
2638820	2640180	Not the tiny powerful one.
2640180	2645380	If I Clark got a handful of pistols from the circle of knowledge, so you guys would all
2645380	2645860	have one.
2645860	2646660	So I want to shoot him.
2646660	2648580	There was just like seven sitting around that accord.
2648580	2648900	Yeah.
2648900	2653700	I want to, uh, I want to shoot him just laying in the backseat, sticking out of the gun box.
2653700	2654420	You guys want a gun?
2654420	2654900	I got some.
2655860	2663540	So, uh, still a 10 for that or a little bouquet of a seven.
2664100	2664500	Okay.
2664500	2665620	So man.
2665620	2665860	Okay.
2668660	2676340	He passes a constitution check to stay with it and he is going to continue bleeding onto
2676340	2678900	the floor pooling in this chair.
2678900	2684820	It is one of those chairs that we like to describe on this show that has the buttons
2684820	2686020	deep pushed in.
2686020	2691380	So there's blood pooling like syrup in a waffle into the back of this chair.
2691380	2691940	Nice.
2691940	2692340	Thank you.
2694420	2697940	Thomas, go ahead and roll a human.
2697940	2698180	Okay.
2700020	2700420	Ooh.
2700420	2700900	Eight.
2700900	2703380	He looks at you and he's like, yeah, yeah.
2703380	2705380	Bruce no likey Bruce Bruce will stop.
2705940	2706180	Yeah.
2706180	2707620	Bruce no likey Bruce will stop.
2711140	2712180	John no likey.
2712180	2713860	When you do that, stop that.
2713860	2714580	That's what I know.
2714580	2719700	Like you want Keith to shoot at you again and your Getty, you know, like that rat.
2719700	2721860	He continues chanting.
2721860	2723460	I'm a little exasperated with him.
2724420	2726500	Down the hallway and see what Winifred's doing.
2726500	2732500	As you turn to look back down the hallway, your ear starts ringing because a gunshot
2732500	2733540	just went off.
2733540	2740260	And as soon as you turn around, you see Bruce Robin has pointed the gun to his own head
2740260	2744420	and has committed suicide in front of Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna.
2744420	2747140	I need you all to roll sanity except for Keith Vigna.
2747140	2748180	Mission accomplished boys.
2748180	2751460	Who does not have to roll sanity when humans die.
2751460	2752340	That's correct.
2753140	2756420	That's a great skill to take and tilt the green.
2758660	2759140	Fuck.
2759140	2760580	Crit fail 77.
2760580	2762180	Uh, just a regular fail for me.
2762180	2768660	Clark Bishop loses one sanity and John Lee Pettymore loses two sanity.
2768660	2769540	I'm at 14.
2773860	2774100	Fuck.
2774740	2779940	He's just covered in this dude's like blood and he's kind of out of it for a second.
2779940	2782580	Keith walks over and gets the ring off his finger.
2782580	2785140	Keith, you get the ring off of his finger.
2785140	2793860	And when you turn around, you see that John Lee Pettymore is writing on the desk in blood.
2794820	2800820	Two, one, eight, two, one, three, five, one.
2800820	2804580	Thomas looking up, you have no recollection of writing this.
2804580	2806340	Do you stop him before he's done?
2806340	2806980	Yeah, for sure.
2807540	2809300	I mean, it's freaking me out that he's not responding.
2809300	2813860	And then seeing those numbers and hearing those numbers from Bruce moments before it's
2813860	2815380	all adding up to something bad.
2815380	2818020	So Clark is putting a stop to that as quick as possible.
2818980	2821540	John, what was, why were you writing those numbers?
2822340	2822820	I'm sorry.
2824900	2825460	I'm sorry.
2826420	2827780	It's been a rough couple of days.
2829300	2832100	Just having that guy's face blow up all over me like that.
2836580	2837860	That shook me just a little bit.
2838580	2842180	But Hey, uh, listen, Maggie sent us here to kill this.
2842180	2842820	Fuck.
2842820	2843940	He's dead.
2843940	2847380	Let's strip him, search the office and a fucking report back.
2847380	2850500	I guess Clark is kind of bewildered.
2850500	2851380	Nodding one.
2851380	2853540	Do those, do those numbers mean something to you, John?
2853540	2854180	What numbers?
2855060	2855380	Those.
2855380	2858180	And I pointed what he had been writing on the desk.
2858180	2862260	Those, those numbers that you were writing on the desk, does that mean something to you?
2862260	2863700	I mean, that's the numbers he wrote.
2863700	2865380	It must, I'm sorry.
2865380	2866820	I can't, I'm a little shook up.
2866820	2869060	I must've just been writing the last thing I remembered.
2869700	2871460	Keith puts that ring on.
2871460	2873700	So I've got two, two of them on.
2873700	2876260	If I like touch them together, does anything happen?
2876260	2878500	No, but they both have the little...
2878500	2879860	Your dick gets a little smaller.
2879860	2881380	Are they, are they exactly the same?
2882980	2884180	They are the exact same.
2884180	2889540	I'm going to string the second one onto that chain again and put it around my neck.
2889540	2895300	And then all of a sudden the double doors to Bruce Robin's office swing open and the
2895300	2900180	three of you realize you aren't standing in the same places.
2900180	2908180	You were just standing and none of you are wearing clothes, but you are completely covered
2908180	2915860	in warm blood and written in the same fresh blood from the lifeless body of Bruce Robin
2915860	2922980	is a new set of numbers covering everything in the office, the floor, the walls, the window,
2922980	2926980	everything over and over and over and over.
2926980	2937620	It repeats two, one, eight, two, one, three, five, one, eight, one, five, two, nine, one,
2937620	2941300	four, and you have no recollection.
2941300	2943620	What the fuck?
2971300	2981620	How am I the only one trying to pull over?
2981620	2985380	How can you have enough?
2985380	2991940	Drowning out all the noise.
2991940	3007940	Cause nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows.
