0	5500	Greasy greetings to all of our fantastic listeners out there.
5500	10900	It is I, the mesmerizing, masticating mutt, Wolf the dog,
10900	15500	Yo DJ, your host, Angel Parental Figure,
15500	18500	and you, fantastic listeners,
18500	26800	are doing a fantastic job of listening to us here at 694.2 PTBP,
26800	30800	coming at you live from some time somewhere.
30800	34300	Who even knows when or where I am anymore?
34300	36000	I certainly don't.
36000	40500	But what I do know is that we got ourselves another Howlin' with Wolf,
40500	43800	and that makes my teeth rattle with joy.
43800	47300	This edition of Howlin' with Wolf is from Ikaris,
47300	51200	who tweeted about the show and tagged "@pretendingpart",
51200	56600	the equivalent of 8.5 normal-sized good deeds or 3.6,
56600	58700	whatever, either way.
58700	62700	Shouts out to Ikaris for telling folks the good news.
62700	64500	Ikaris writes,
64500	72100	I'm sorry for picturing you drinking the grease I used to eject from the name-redacted fast food bin.
72100	76500	It still makes me sick, and I have no idea how you do it.
76500	79100	But you do you, Mr. Wolf.
79100	85200	That grease has to go somewhere, and I guess you eating it is better than a landfill.
85200	90600	Everyone listen to the podcast. It's a fantastic time, Phil.
90600	92300	Thank you for your time.
92300	95600	Well, damn, thanks for writing in, Ikaris.
95600	99000	I am the gleeful grease trap.
99000	101900	You got grease you need disposed of?
101900	104000	I'm here to gobble it up.
104000	109200	And even if you don't want me to, I'll probably still grab a gulp of three.
109200	116200	Much of the grease I consume immediately spreads itself amongst my many hair follicles,
116200	118600	coating them and making me more...
118600	121100	aerodynamic?
121100	122400	I don't know, y'all.
122400	127800	I just know that after I get that grease, I'm slipping around faster than hell.
127800	131800	Now, if you want to write up something for your greasy wolf to howl,
131800	134700	tag "@pretendingpart on Instagram",
134700	137000	tag "@pretendingpart on Twitter",
137000	139800	tag "@pretendingto be people on Facebook",
139800	145900	or write up a five-star review on the podcast app of your choice and holler at your wolf about it.
145900	152100	If you want to support the show and make sure it doesn't disappear into a smooth void,
152100	160200	exchange financial support for bonus content over at patreon.com slash pretending pod.
160200	166800	If you want to find links to all our shit here at 694.2 PTBP,
166800	170200	the links are in the show notes.
170200	175000	Don't blink, don't think, just sink into the deep.
175000	177200	It's time for the news.
177200	181800	Last time, the Cannes crew went to Julius and X's house,
181800	184800	cleaned up a bit and discussed next steps.
184800	189800	But Julius is clearly having a harder time dealing with recent events.
189800	193600	Will Cal and Beck agree to work alongside X?
193600	200600	This woman who clearly has no regard for Julius's health in the names of truth and journalism?
200600	203800	Will Stevie and Cal keep each other's trust?
203800	208600	Will Julius's loss of grip lead him to losing himself?
208600	212000	Will Beck get even wilder?
212000	216600	All this and more coming at you right after Alter Girl with
216600	220600	My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.
223600	230600	Cause my life is great and it's all mine.
237600	245600	Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.
254600	259600	I was saying, cause you build your sandwich here and then you go, yeah, you go to your next station.
259600	261600	You're only that next station.
261600	265600	Yeah, I don't know, a bunch of shredded lettuce and then I fucking kill myself.
265600	271600	I beat up who's ever keeping me from the meat bins and take what's mine.
271600	276600	I'd take down a bunch of banana peppers probably. I'm a big fan of eating those, just raw.
276600	277600	Yeah, that'd be good.
277600	284600	Banana peppers are solid. Cuc, tomato, Sammy. Cuc on either side of the tomato with some Dijon mustard.
284600	288600	Can you cut the part of him saying, I love eating those raw?
288600	291600	I mean, if meats are out, bread's out.
291600	296600	Yeah, the Sammy was the cucumber. The cuc was the bread.
296600	301600	Can I have the fish scoopables?
301600	303600	Like tuna?
303600	305600	The fish scoopables.
305600	310600	That's a main protein. I think that's excluded.
310600	312600	Damn it. Cheese?
312600	315600	Cheese is a topping. No, cheese goes on first.
315600	318600	Technically cheese is part of that first bracket.
318600	323600	Can I go somewhere else?
323600	326600	I don't like this restaurant.
326600	331600	I'll just eat tomatoes with oil and vinegar.
331600	333600	There you go.
333600	337600	They have secret shakers up there and oregano is one of them.
337600	339600	You guys throw some oregano on there?
339600	342600	Oh, he's definitely getting that on the tomato. Maybe a little salt and pepper too.
342600	348600	I'm going to get the oregano shaker, put oil in it and eat that.
348600	350600	Like soup, oregano soup.
350600	352600	Oregano soup.
352600	354600	Can I throw it in the bread toaster?
354600	358600	Oh, hey, my whole family's from Italy. We were from oregano.
358600	360600	Why can you toast it?
360600	361600	I'm going to say you can toast it.
361600	362600	You can toast it.
362600	363600	That's the perk.
363600	367600	Then I will have shredded lettuce toasted, please.
367600	370600	Line out the door immediately.
370600	373600	Did you say shredded lettuce toasted?
373600	374600	That's it.
374600	376600	Burnt ends, baby.
376600	380600	I'll have the vegan burnt ends.
380600	384600	That's just singed lettuce.
384600	386600	All right, I'll start recording.
386600	387600	Yeah, we should have been recording that.
387600	390600	You know how somebody's doing the transcripts for all the episodes?
390600	392600	Oh, yeah. Can we shout out Cinder Crow?
392600	394600	A true American hero.
394600	395600	Who's doing it?
395600	396600	Or wherever you're from.
396600	399600	You're a hero to us in America, so you're an American hero.
399600	401600	You're our American hero.
401600	403600	Well, I was thinking, because I read through some of it,
403600	406600	and it's really detailed and good,
406600	412600	so what if we made some funny sounds and words to see what it does?
412600	415600	Oh, yeah. We should really start trying to mess with this guy.
415600	418600	Flurbin, lurbin, shlick.
418600	421600	I'm going to say there, there, there, there.
421600	422600	Which ones am I using?
422600	424600	Oh, my gosh.
424600	426600	You're a nightmare to people like him.
426600	427600	Who knows?
427600	432600	Buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo.
432600	433600	Seriously.
433600	434600	Cinder Crow.
434600	436600	Huge shout out to Cinder Crow.
436600	437600	Absolutely.
437600	438600	That is so insane.
438600	439600	You rock.
439600	440600	Thank you so much.
440600	441600	Bazinga.
441600	443600	Now you've got to write Bazinga in your transcript.
443600	444600	Yeah.
444600	447600	Also, you get to write our season two recap episodes.
448600	452600	Honestly, because of the transcripts, we don't have to do those.
452600	455600	I mean, that seems...
455600	457600	Well, we can do those. It's just you've got notes.
457600	459600	Okay. All right. I'll start now.
459600	461600	Six months off.
461600	463600	I don't think it'll be as hard this time.
463600	465600	No, I'll still do it.
465600	468600	The recap episodes, they were fun for you to do, right?
469600	473600	That was like a pleasurable part of this life venture, right?
473600	474600	This life venture, right?
474600	478600	I started sweating through both shirts.
478600	480600	Seriously, if you haven't checked out the transcripts
480600	484600	or if you know someone who would be into the transcripts,
484600	485600	you can find them.
485600	487600	They're linked over on our Discord,
487600	489600	and you can find that Discord...
489600	491600	In the show notes.
491600	492600	In the show notes.
493600	500600	Another big, big part of this is that I've been training in AI on those transcripts.
500600	503600	And so pretty soon, none of us will be necessary,
503600	508600	which means all of your Patreon money will go straight to making the pod better.
509600	513600	We're all cut out from that process as soon as I perfect this machine.
514600	518600	I read one of the AI transcripts that you generated,
518600	522600	and my favorite part was the guy who is playing Luke,
522600	523600	and he says,
523600	525600	This mystery's mysterious!
525600	529600	And then fart noises for 45 seconds.
529600	531600	It's absurdly accurate.
531600	532600	That was a good one.
532600	534600	Speaking of fart noises...
535600	536600	Yeah.
537600	538600	Human fart noise.
538600	539600	Taylor just walked in.
539600	540600	Wow.
540600	543600	And gave it to us good on the mic.
545600	546600	See you guys.
546600	547600	Bye.
547600	548600	Bye.
548600	549600	We can cut all that out.
549600	550600	Just the end and the buy.
550600	554600	Last night, this home security salesman came to my house,
554600	555600	and it was fucking...
555600	556600	It was after dark.
556600	558600	I had not turned my French ports light on,
558600	560600	so I just get this knock on my door,
560600	561600	and I can see nothing.
561600	562600	Ugh.
562600	563600	So I open it up, it's just the fucking...
563600	564600	Did you turn the light on?
564600	565600	I turned the light on.
565600	567600	It's the vivid guy.
567600	568600	It's good he wasn't blurry.
568600	569600	He's like,
569600	572600	Hey, I assume you're the homeowner or the renter?
572600	573600	And I was like,
573600	574600	Yeah, I'm the renter.
574600	575600	And he's like,
575600	576600	Well, you know, this isn't the highest crime area,
576600	579600	but talking to some of your neighbors tonight,
579600	580600	I know there's a lot of petty crimes,
580600	582600	like package thefts and car break-ins,
582600	584600	so if you'd be interested in a camera or anything,
584600	585600	and I was like,
585600	586600	Oh no, I'm the one doing all those,
586600	587600	so I don't want any more cameras.
587600	588600	What?
588600	589600	Did you really?
589600	590600	Yeah.
590600	597600	Oh my god, what did he say?
597600	599600	He just laughed nervously,
599600	600600	and then I shut the door on him.
600600	601600	He said,
601600	603600	You should buy all my cameras then.
603600	605600	Once they're gone, they're gone.
605600	608600	I opened up my door the other day to a doorbell ring,
608600	610600	and it must have been the knock.
610600	611600	My doorbell doesn't work.
612600	620600	And a young lad on one of those bird scooters.
620600	621600	It wasn't a bird.
621600	622600	It was a plane.
622600	623600	You stand flat on it.
623600	624600	Superman.
624600	626600	And there's just two wheels on either side of your feet.
626600	627600	Oh, those.
627600	628600	Like, yeah.
628600	629600	Like a hoverboard thing.
629600	630600	They call them hoverboards.
630600	631600	Yeah, the hoverboard.
631600	633600	He was just hoverboarding around the neighborhood.
633600	634600	Nice.
634600	635600	How old was he?
635600	638600	He couldn't have been a day over, what?
638600	639600	Seven.
639600	640600	Seven, yeah.
640600	643600	Those labor laws, man, in Missouri.
643600	644600	What was he selling?
644600	646600	How many Bibles did you buy?
646600	647600	He said pest control,
647600	650600	and I just closed my door and was like,
650600	653600	Oh, no, I'm sorry.
653600	658600	That's when they sprinkle the bag of pests on the lawn.
658600	661600	Like, okay, I'll be back in a few weeks.
661600	664600	Yeah, so as you can see, my legs are now covered.
664600	665600	I'm not wearing pants.
665600	666600	These are ticks.
666600	668600	You got pests everywhere.
668600	669600	Should we do it?
669600	670600	Should we do it?
670600	671600	Should we do it?
671600	672600	I'm really excited to do it.
672600	674600	I don't know what we're going to do.
674600	676600	You just said, like, pants made out of ticks.
676600	679600	Are we not already in it?
679600	681600	That's what Beck Wilder sees.
681600	688600	No, as Beck Wilder, Cal Colorado, Julius Summers, his roommate, X, Stevie Godel, and Jeremy,
688600	689600	the intern.
689600	690600	Jeremy.
690600	696600	Do we need, do we need euphemisms like roommate now that we know?
696600	697600	Okay, X.
697600	700600	We'll just go with X, his co-worker.
700600	702600	Yeah, we'll say co-worker.
702600	703600	X.
703600	706600	That's, again, a euphemism.
706600	708600	But technically true.
708600	711600	But so his roommate is technically true as well.
711600	712600	She's many things.
712600	713600	Isn't she your boss?
713600	715600	Some people could look at it that way.
715600	716600	Sure.
716600	717600	Yeah, a little bit, maybe.
717600	725600	And they're all, you're all at the close to empty house where Julius and X are living.
725600	732600	It's Wednesday, July 6th, 2022, and it is quite late.
732600	738600	On a fairly rough note, even though he just taken the time to clean a few folks' guts
738600	746480	and spray from off himself and change suits, Julius is openly bleeding once again, half
746480	750600	of his face now scraped in raw, beating up with his own blood.
750600	757600	And on a more positive note, Stevie just realized they trust Cal Colorado.
757600	763600	Jeremy, the intern, stands up from the Ikea couch and stretches his arms and legs while
763600	766600	letting out a big old yawn, signaling his exit.
766600	771600	And on his way out, he squares his shoulders to Cal and assures you,
771600	776600	I won't say a word until you arrive at Cannes in 48 hours as the producer.
776600	779600	Just idle nose and coffees for everyone.
779600	782600	And with that, he's off.
782600	783600	48 hours?
783600	788600	That's what X had told you is that she needed 48 hours to kind of clean up the Julius mess
788600	792600	before you were to be named the new producer.
792600	794600	And then that's when we can air the footage as well?
794600	795600	Yep.
795600	801600	And X looking down at her phone says to Julius,
801600	803600	I've just alerted the doctor.
803600	805600	She's on her way.
805600	806600	Would I know this doctor?
806600	812600	I'm not exactly sure if you've met this one, but one of the few in the city that
812600	814600	knows to look the other way, I suppose.
814600	815600	What's their name?
815600	817600	She looks down at her phone again.
817600	820600	I guess we just call her Dr. Murray.
820600	822600	Dr. Murray.
822600	823600	Hmm.
823600	829600	Is it going to be the usual or, I mean, do we have access to those Godel things?
829600	833600	She kind of looks at the other three of you.
833600	835600	I can attest that they work like a charm, dude.
835600	837600	He got killed.
837600	841600	No, not killed, but almost died from a rabbit.
841600	848600	He was very much impaled by a, not a real jackalope, but a rabbit who had been senselessly
848600	854600	tied up with antlers to resemble a jackalope and then left to wander willy nilly.
854600	856600	And of course it was going to impale someone.
856600	858600	You know, of course someone was going to trip and impale themselves on that.
858600	859600	It was a hazard.
859600	860600	It was a hazard.
860600	862600	But yes, the medicine thing they had.
862600	863600	It wasn't my fault.
863600	864600	It wasn't his fault.
864600	867600	But, like, it's me that's going to die now.
867600	869600	So, like, do we?
869600	872600	Well, you don't look like you're going to die.
872600	873600	I don't feel very good.
873600	874600	He kind of does, though.
874600	875600	Look at him.
875600	876600	How many hit points do you have?
876600	880600	This is the first time you've cared about that in three days.
880600	882600	It's all rushing back to him.
882600	883600	It hurts.
883600	886600	I'm at 40 percent capacity, it feels like.
887600	893600	You were at, like, 10 percent capacity and insisted we not take you to a hospital.
893600	896600	Sometimes the heat of the moment.
896600	899600	I had the napkins shoved in me and they were helping.
899600	902600	And he points to the napkins shoved in his gun wound.
902600	905600	And Beck winks at Stevie.
905600	906600	Yeah, man.
906600	907600	Good work.
907600	908600	Thanks.
908600	910600	I do the best that I can.
910600	911600	Is she coming here?
911600	913600	Yes, she is close by.
913600	920600	Stevie, as fine as your improvisational work was, we do need a real doctor to look at you.
920600	921600	The door slams open.
921600	922600	What is the doctor, Murray?
922600	923600	A doctor of?
923600	926600	Yeah, the real doctor you say that you need.
926600	935600	And this elderly woman with thick gray hair, thin and wiry and built five feet tall and
935600	939600	created by Chainsaw Unicorn from Augusta, Georgia.
939600	941600	Shout out to Chainsaw Unicorn.
942600	945600	Unicorn noise.
952600	954600	Whoa, is that what a unicorn sounds like?
954600	956600	Yeah, the hiss and squish.
959600	967600	Chainsaw Unicorn is patron at at least the $10 level over on patreon.com slash pretending pod.
967600	973600	And you too can send in an NPC or a location at that tier and support the show over there.
973600	976600	You know what not enough people take advantage of is they can describe the voice.
976600	979600	That's a very true statement, yes.
979600	981600	And I don't know if you can see.
981600	984600	Because otherwise they all sound like this.
984600	989600	I don't know if you can see, but I'm wearing clothes that are two sizes too big.
989600	994600	Looks like a strong wind could turn me into a pretty awesome kite.
994600	996600	But yes, I'm here to help you.
996600	998600	I'm here to help you out.
998600	1003600	Who's the benevolent neither of the help.
1003600	1005600	Oh, look at you.
1005600	1006600	Look at your face.
1006600	1012600	Julius looks at Cal and Beck and is like, yeah, they're generally pretty.
1012600	1014600	They're always this weird.
1014600	1017600	And I thought you hadn't met him.
1017600	1021600	I hadn't, but I mean, like all the doctors that they send are this weird.
1021600	1024600	So why don't you want to go to a fucking hospital?
1025600	1029600	This is like been my only interaction with doctors ever.
1030600	1033600	Yeah, sure. They're all a little weird, but not like this.
1033600	1040600	Julius rips his shirt off and just points to his bloody mess with napkins and everything shoved in it.
1040600	1043600	Oh, yeah. Okay. I see. I see.
1043600	1049600	Okay, you're going to need to have your lay down on the on the kitchen island table over there, the countertop.
1049600	1051600	Just strip on down to your baccas.
1051600	1055600	Yeah, I heard I heard about the incident the last time.
1055600	1059600	Oh, Mr. Big Thighs had had is the doctor.
1059600	1061600	Things got bad.
1061600	1063600	And now we can we talk less?
1063600	1067600	Maybe just kind of I'm for gossip.
1067600	1068600	That's kind of my whole thing.
1068600	1069600	Okay. Tell me.
1069600	1076600	It's funny. Tell me the juiciest stuff, but it hurts and ripping the napkins about.
1076600	1080600	But with a Swift, let's see a Swift.
1080600	1083600	Oh, a extreme.
1083600	1084600	It's not good.
1084600	1085600	No, it's extremely good.
1085600	1088600	I rolled a 77, but she has an 80.
1088600	1089600	Fuck yeah.
1089600	1093600	I was just, you know, I figured that's pretty high.
1094600	1103600	One plus three is four hit points are restored back to you as she rips you up, tears you down and sews you up.
1104600	1106600	Basically without you even realizing it.
1106600	1114600	And then for the final critical role trick here, she goes, oh, and I got something real fucking neat for your face.
1114600	1119600	And she has a suitcase with her that she cracks open for the first time.
1119600	1122600	Everything previous has just been in her bag.
1122600	1132600	And inside the suitcase, you see a contraption that, while familiar, does have very specifically different sort of branding.
1133600	1142600	Cal's trying to be subtle, but he, uh, he very clearly is like taking a picture of this and he's winking to Beck for the story.
1142600	1143600	Yeah.
1143600	1146600	And everyone is like pretty in awe.
1146600	1155600	Like this is as if we were standing around and someone pulled out like a very cool new contraption that yeah, like that we hadn't seen before.
1155600	1157600	Like what would a new three.
1157600	1158600	Thank you.
1158600	1159600	Dicked dildo.
1159600	1160600	Oh my God. Can you imagine?
1160600	1161600	I've seen that.
1162600	1164600	New Xbox.
1166600	1169600	Not with prehensile balls.
1170600	1174600	Those are the two kinds of jokes you're going to get here pretending to be people.
1174600	1176600	Oh doc, patch me up.
1176600	1178600	What do you call that thing?
1178600	1182600	Well, I've been calling it the skin graft 2000.
1182600	1183600	Awesome.
1183600	1185600	We can hook you up with some marketing people to work on that.
1185600	1186600	That does seem fair.
1186600	1189600	I don't know what the folks upstairs are going to call it.
1189600	1193600	It's July of 2022, so 2000 doesn't seem very futuristic anymore.
1193600	1197600	Well, they don't need names for stuff in the military probably.
1197600	1200600	No, no, they, they all have names for their things.
1200600	1204600	Oh, well, who's the marketing people for the military?
1204600	1207600	Oh, well, I mean.
1207600	1213600	And she slams, she slams this, uh, this device on, on Julius Summers face.
1213600	1217600	You know, when the question itself is so wrong, you don't know where to begin to answer.
1220600	1222600	Does it feel good?
1222600	1224600	That's a good question.
1224600	1227600	Beck, do you remember what it felt like?
1227600	1229600	I think it was good.
1235600	1236600	Yeah.
1236600	1240600	Uh, go ahead and, sorry, I was waiting for whatever this is.
1240600	1242600	Feels so good.
1244600	1247600	Beck is filming the process and no one has a problem with that.
1248600	1250600	Oh man, it feels good.
1250600	1251600	Yeah.
1251600	1266600	Dr. Murray says, and you feel the, these like warm rays like shining in, penetrating, and then you feel a sort of tingle almost like a, like a foaming sensation that you can hear.
1266600	1272600	And then it's, it's like, like pop rocks is kind of the vibe.
1272600	1273600	Yeah.
1273600	1275600	Pop rocks with a mouthful of Sprite.
1275600	1279600	And you feel warm.
1279600	1282600	You feel nice.
1282600	1291600	She pulls it off and everyone looking sees Julius Summers with a face, a whole face.
1291600	1293600	Nothing but a face, so help me God.
1297600	1298600	It's his?
1298600	1299600	Yeah.
1299600	1306600	It's just completely cleaned up every single cut and skin is smooth.
1306600	1309600	Just matching the other half of his face.
1309600	1312600	Julius, you look like a million bucks.
1312600	1313600	It feels great.
1313600	1317600	I mean, God, we, we got to tell people about this stuff.
1317600	1319600	Hey doc, can I get a hit of that?
1319600	1320600	Yeah, what do you need?
1320600	1321600	What do you need?
1321600	1322600	What is going on?
1322600	1325600	I mean, I just haven't felt a hundred percent the same since I fell on that Jackalope.
1325600	1327600	Why don't you just give me a top up?
1327600	1328600	Okay.
1328600	1330600	You said it was a, you sat on it.
1330600	1331600	Yeah.
1331600	1332600	All right.
1332600	1333600	Face down.
1333600	1334600	Ass up.
1334600	1335600	All right.
1335600	1338600	That's the way I'll stitch you up.
1338600	1339600	You got it.
1339600	1347600	Beck bends over the couch and he just flips up the shirt tails on his Hawaiian shirt and
1347600	1348600	jacket.
1348600	1349600	Yeah.
1349600	1350600	Jacket.
1350600	1353600	You receive four hit points.
1353600	1354600	Yeah.
1354600	1358600	Cal Cal took the camera from you and it's filming that, but his thumb is like over a
1358600	1366600	quarter of the lens, which is really hard to do on a camera like this.
1366600	1367600	Huge thumbs.
1367600	1369600	We never talked about it.
1369600	1371600	Did I recover any hit points from the face?
1371600	1372600	Uh, healing.
1372600	1374600	Uh, no, that was with two rolls.
1374600	1375600	Unfortunately.
1375600	1376600	That was your sweet.
1376600	1377600	Yeah.
1377600	1379600	At least I look good.
1379600	1382600	Julius thinks and then makes a note to go check.
1382600	1383600	Julius.
1383600	1386600	I have a little pocket mirror, uh, in my makeup kit that you could use.
1386600	1388600	All anchors carry these all reporters carry these.
1388600	1389600	Take a look at that.
1389600	1390600	Don't go back into that bathroom please.
1390600	1395600	Uh, Hey doctor, doctor Murray, could I get one of those for, you know, before I go on
1395600	1396600	air?
1396600	1398600	Oh, you want, you like, you want to have one.
1398600	1401600	I want to, I want to be able to do the face thing.
1401600	1405600	Well, these are very important to the firm currently.
1405600	1407600	And uh, what, what firm?
1407600	1409600	Well, the program, you know, the group, you know?
1409600	1410600	Yeah.
1410600	1411600	What's that called?
1411600	1412600	No name for it.
1412600	1413600	Obviously.
1413600	1414600	Obviously.
1414600	1417600	Julius chuckles too.
1417600	1422600	Well, his name's for things that exist.
1422600	1424600	My dear boy.
1424600	1425600	Yes.
1425600	1427600	And we don't exist.
1427600	1429600	Wink, wink.
1429600	1430600	She winks.
1430600	1432600	I look back at Beck and see if he was filming that.
1432600	1433600	I was.
1433600	1438600	I wink at Beck.
1438600	1441600	That puts the lens cover on and off.
1441600	1443600	Oh my God.
1443600	1449600	A little camera wink.
1449600	1451600	But you said that it was military issues.
1451600	1452600	So you're military.
1452600	1458600	Well, you know, uh, I suppose every once in a while, you know, I get there, I become it.
1458600	1460600	What kind of doctor are you Dr. Murray?
1460600	1463600	Mostly, uh, surgical.
1463600	1464600	People?
1464600	1465600	People.
1465600	1467600	Yeah, of course people.
1467600	1468600	Okay.
1468600	1472600	Well, and if he got something else laying around, I'll look at it.
1472600	1473600	Of course.
1473600	1476600	Cal thinks about that.
1476600	1483600	Of course.
1483600	1487600	We may have a person who's half a god turtle.
1487600	1489600	He probably, Stevie.
1489600	1492600	I mean, yeah, but we don't know where he is.
1492600	1494600	That should be our top priority though.
1494600	1495600	Right?
1495600	1496600	Finding your brother.
1496600	1497600	We've got a clear 48 hours.
1497600	1500600	I think that's maybe our next plan of attack.
1500600	1503600	Breaks in the news cycle like this don't come often, Stevie.
1503600	1504600	Yeah.
1504600	1505600	Yeah.
1505600	1506600	No, you're right.
1506600	1511900	That, that's exactly, that's exactly what we should do.
1511900	1526480	And they show you a Reddit post that only has like 460, that only has like 800 and 36
1526480	1527480	upvotes on it.
1527480	1528480	That's a lot.
1528480	1529480	Yeah.
1529480	1531480	It's doing all right.
1531480	1532480	Yeah.
1532480	1541480	And it is a hole in the ground somewhere in South America.
1541480	1542480	Oh shit.
1542480	1543480	Uh oh.
1543480	1548080	I don't know if he's like available.
1548080	1549080	He's gone international.
1549080	1554400	I want to show that to X and see what her reaction is.
1554400	1556200	Is this a particularly smooth hole?
1556200	1558920	Oh, it's an incredibly smooth hole.
1558920	1562400	How does she react to that?
1562400	1563880	Um, wow.
1563880	1567240	Uh, what does the article say about it?
1567240	1574920	Yeah, it says that it's, um, there is some sort of like a lightning tornado storm and
1574920	1583080	now the, yeah, that no one's going near the hole cause they can actually see down, but
1583080	1589540	they can keep seeing down until they can't see any more down, I guess.
1589540	1592920	Does your brother have a place in South America or your family?
1592920	1593920	Well, yeah.
1593920	1594920	Where?
1594920	1597520	Is it a place like the gorge?
1597520	1600400	Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.
1600400	1602360	There's, there's no more of those.
1602360	1603960	So it's like a place that you vacation?
1603960	1608640	Well, no, I mean we have a home down there, but it's not even in the same country as this.
1608640	1619840	It's like, ah, we have, we have a, we have a home in Brazil and cow goes, I said it,
1619840	1623280	I said it normally zoom in and enhance that picture.
1623280	1624280	Where's it from?
1624280	1625360	This happened in Chile.
1625360	1632400	She just swipes on the screen to enlarge it.
1632400	1634240	Do any of you guys speak Spanish?
1634240	1635240	Okay.
1635840	1640640	See, that's, that's not a whole, and like one of the top comments is linking another
1640640	1646520	Reddit article that is in Europe and it's like a huge hole in the ground.
1646520	1648520	That's very smooth.
1648520	1651200	Stevie how many, how many of these are there?
1651200	1652200	I don't know.
1652200	1659120	I just started seeing them like today, but there, there seems to be a few, a fair, fair
1659120	1660720	amount of them.
1660720	1662120	Are they just all in the ground?
1662120	1665640	Are they in other, yeah.
1665640	1672440	One went through a building like half, like half of a building is just like gone.
1672440	1677560	So Stevie, do you know anything about this power your brother has or what these holes
1677560	1678560	are for?
1678560	1689080	I mean, I know that, um, they're starting to get tears in their eyes.
1689080	1700920	I know that my granddad and I guess my dad were keeping it trapped and we like let it
1700920	1701920	out or whatever.
1701920	1707040	And then I let it out or whatever.
1707040	1708040	On the bridge?
1708040	1710040	I didn't know it was there.
1710040	1713760	I didn't, he just did like immediately.
1713760	1714760	What did you see?
1714760	1716400	I mean, I saw the same as everybody else.
1716400	1721120	I saw, I saw the lightning, like the tunnel from like afar.
1721120	1727520	I wasn't even over there, but I didn't know what it was at first and it started dawning
1727520	1728520	on me.
1728520	1732760	This is a very important question, Stevie.
1732760	1736320	Between then and now, have you contacted anyone in your family?
1736320	1745120	No, just like the cops, you know, to like try to do the whole blackmail thing.
1745120	1748640	How come God couldn't teleport out of Grover's gorge?
1748640	1750800	Is there a spell?
1750800	1752200	No, I think he is.
1752200	1754200	I think he was in a turtle.
1754200	1756720	So being in a human is what caused?
1756720	1760720	Or maybe there's a spell like, oh, that might be it.
1760720	1763600	When it was in a turtle, were there like little holes maybe?
1763600	1764600	Or slow holes?
1764600	1765880	Oh, there you go.
1765880	1769360	Slow tiny holes.
1769360	1774520	Like aerated lawn or like, no, I don't.
1774520	1775520	Little microbursts.
1775520	1777160	Not that I know of.
1777160	1782280	They might've looked like potholes, divots, but very smooth.
1782280	1785320	Sorry, it's like so late.
1785320	1788240	It's been a long day.
1788240	1789240	Okay.
1789240	1791040	Beck, get them an energy drink.
1791040	1792040	You got it.
1792040	1793200	Oh, energy drink?
1793200	1794200	Give me one.
1794200	1795200	Oh, okay.
1795200	1796200	Yeah.
1796200	1798200	I love energy drink.
1798200	1799200	Me too.
1799200	1800200	Go, go, go.
1800200	1801200	Well, where are the...
1801200	1806200	Where the fuck is he going next?
1806200	1807320	I don't know.
1807320	1809320	Do you see any rhyme or reason to it?
1809320	1810320	Can we...
1810320	1811760	Let's maybe start plotting them out.
1811760	1813920	Like where are they ending up?
1813920	1814920	Okay.
1814920	1816920	Maybe it's a drawing.
1816920	1817920	Maybe it's a symbol.
1817920	1819880	A good old fashioned connect the dots.
1819880	1821480	We saw symbols in the pit.
1821480	1823560	Maybe that's it.
1823560	1825800	Let's Google map them.
1825800	1827080	Let's Google map them.
1827080	1829080	Let's Google map them.
1829080	1834720	Wait, Stevie, have any of the nerds in your phone started doing that already?
1834720	1836560	Oh, that's really smart.
1836560	1839240	Yeah, those Reddit tweets have been breaking a lot of shit on us.
1839240	1842600	Yeah, they could move this forward like so fast.
1842600	1848120	Can you talk to them?
1848120	1851200	Can you talk to them?
1851200	1853000	I feel like sometimes everything I say is wrong.
1853000	1854240	Oh, no, no, no.
1854240	1855240	I didn't mean like...
1855240	1856240	No, no.
1856240	1857240	No, it's good.
1857240	1858240	I can't.
1858240	1859240	I can't ask.
1859240	1862200	And they're just like going through the phone and...
1862200	1866560	Beck says, I'll help you out and Beck starts doing it too because that's where he lives
1866560	1867560	is online.
1867560	1871080	He's already had burner accounts that he can start putting stuff in different forms.
1871080	1872600	Do you have the stats to back that up?
1872600	1873840	I think I do.
1873840	1876040	I've got computer science if you want to use that.
1876040	1877800	Yeah, that's what I use to scroll Reddit.
1877800	1878800	Hold on.
1878800	1879800	Yeah, that's it.
1879800	1884840	It does not take computer science to know how to troll on Reddit with backup accounts.
1884840	1886000	What skill do you want me to roll?
1886000	1888560	No, I'd like you to roll computer science, please.
1888560	1890040	It's the only one that makes sense.
1890040	1891040	Oh, fuck.
1891040	1892040	Hold on.
1892040	1895240	I think it intrinsically makes sense with Beck's character.
1895240	1897960	Oh, that it's automatic?
1897960	1898960	Yeah.
1898960	1900960	What's your percent?
1900960	1904440	I've got 60 in computer science and I rolled a seven.
1904440	1905440	Okay.
1905440	1909240	Then suspicious activity was detected on your accounts.
1909240	1910360	You were upvoting.
1910360	1914320	It was clear that you were upvoting from the same like ISP on your multiple accounts.
1914320	1915520	God, I'm out of practice.
1915520	1922440	Julius pulls his phone out, but can't figure out how to navigate off of the leg day subreddit.
1922440	1924340	So he just puts it back.
1924340	1927520	He doesn't want to leave that page anyway.
1927520	1929920	No one on there is talking about it?
1929920	1932800	He scrolls through a few scrolls.
1932800	1933800	Does he see anything?
1933800	1934800	What?
1934800	1935800	Roll computer science?
1935800	1939400	I have zero.
1939400	1940920	The baseline is zero?
1940920	1941920	Yeah.
1941920	1947560	I have U10 that's like giving Beck a 70, so I can't do that.
1947560	1951400	No, you can do that.
1951400	1958600	The only post he sees is the title is like, did a whole lot of leg workouts today.
1958600	1962400	It's spelled H-O-L-E.
1962400	1965120	And everybody gets what he's talking about.
1965120	1967800	So it's the highest upvoted on the page right now.
1967800	1972880	The weightlifter is spreading whole while showing off thighs.
1972880	1975920	So there's no map made or what?
1975920	1976920	Yeah.
1976920	1980920	How long is it going to take these nerds?
1980920	1981920	I don't know.
1981920	1987120	Like, I mean, they don't always crack everything like right away and even if they do, it might
1987120	1993200	just be like in some lost thread somewhere that we haven't found, but I'll keep looking.
1993200	1998680	I mean, just tell me where the points are and I got a map here somewhere probably.
1998680	1999680	Okay.
1999680	2000680	Let's do this.
2000680	2005640	Julius goes upstairs and finds just like a, he never hung it up on the wall, but like
2005640	2015480	a big map as art, not huge, like that Luke is holding his hands about two feet apart.
2015480	2018160	It's two feet map, two foot map.
2018160	2024200	Is a SIGINT specifically technology or could it be used to like decipher a cipher?
2024200	2025200	It's absolutely.
2025200	2026200	It's for deciphering.
2026200	2027200	Specifically.
2027200	2028200	For deciphering.
2028200	2029200	Yeah.
2029200	2030200	If we lay out the plots, can I use a SIGINT roll?
2030200	2031200	Yeah.
2031200	2032200	Me too.
2032200	2033200	All right.
2033200	2034200	Let's roll those SIGINTs boys.
2034200	2035200	Oh.
2035200	2036200	Oh fuck.
2036200	2037200	I got an 86.
2037200	2038200	I got a 92.
2038200	2039200	Oh my God.
2039200	2040200	Damn.
2040200	2041200	I have a 70.
2041200	2047200	I thought that was a 69 at first.
2047240	2048240	Oh yeah.
2048240	2049240	Joe, you're reading it wrong.
2049240	2051240	You got a 69.
2051240	2052240	Damn.
2052240	2053240	Fuck.
2053240	2054240	God.
2054240	2055400	It's just like dots on a map.
2055400	2056400	It does.
2056400	2057680	It just looks like dots on a map.
2057680	2062120	Well, I think if we maybe give these Reddit nerds some time while we prepare in other
2062120	2064720	ways, maybe that will come to fruition for us.
2064720	2066520	Have we tried calling your brother?
2066520	2067520	Uh, yeah.
2067520	2068520	Hmm.
2068520	2076520	Where'd he say he was?
2076960	2082320	They hold their phone up and it's like outgoing call, outgoing call, outgoing call, outgoing
2082320	2084200	call, outgoing call, outgoing call.
2084200	2090200	Cal leans over the back and goes, rent free.
2090200	2096680	Stevie, when you like let him loose, did he like say anything?
2096680	2102480	Did he seem like he was himself at first or like, did he communicate with you at all?
2102480	2105280	He was, he was really, he was really wet.
2106280	2107960	And he looked afraid.
2107960	2109920	He looked afraid.
2109920	2115560	Wet and afraid was the alternative title of this podcast.
2115560	2126320	I've just felt this presence just emanate like through my mind and it was so scared.
2126320	2132760	And I, I just, I wanted to show that I was on its side and I wanted to, I thought that
2132760	2139560	if I could prove that I wasn't a threat, you know, like, I don't know, I, when he,
2139560	2143200	when he physically like went away from you, was he running?
2143200	2145160	Like, was he like scared?
2145160	2146160	Scared?
2146160	2156160	No, no, we walked out the door and he just looked back at me and in his eyes it looked
2156160	2157880	like he, it looked like he was there.
2157880	2168520	It looked like, it looked like Greg and just like a single tear rolled down his face and
2168520	2172080	then he wasn't, rolled for what?
2172080	2182320	Greg, yeah, I just, I'm sopping wet, just walked away.
2182320	2189640	I called after him and I ran for him and I, I tried to grab onto him and push me off.
2189640	2193480	It wasn't, it wasn't him, it wasn't him anymore.
2193480	2199000	It wasn't, just kept walking.
2199000	2205040	Stevie did Greg display an interest in wet smooth holes from a young age?
2205040	2215600	What, why, why is everyone giggling?
2215600	2219600	Well I personally think it was because of the pussy joke.
2219600	2224400	Oh, Cal turns very red.
2224400	2232440	This is, this is quite a lot and this whole time X has been just on her phone typing stuff,
2232440	2234120	swiping and such.
2234120	2239020	When we saw you at the bridge hole, were you, was that your first hole?
2239020	2240020	You saw her at the bridge?
2240020	2241520	Yeah, at the bridge hole.
2241520	2243440	You didn't tell me about the bridge hole.
2243440	2250280	Yes, I ran into your compatriots so we hadn't agreed whether you were going to bring them
2250280	2259000	in or not and yes, that was my, my first of these incidences of the holes.
2259000	2261800	Is it like coming up in your, on your guys's radar?
2261800	2266120	Yeah, it seems like maybe if you're investigating that first hole you'd be investigating the
2266120	2267120	subsequent holes.
2267120	2272800	Yes, I'm being told that the holes are being attended to.
2272800	2275360	But you and Julius were here before the hole.
2275360	2276840	What were you here doing?
2276840	2277840	Hey, yeah.
2277840	2280800	Well, that Godel technology that you saw.
2280800	2281800	Yeah.
2281800	2282800	Yeah.
2282800	2291560	Yeah, we would like to just like make the world aware that it's being used and his whole
2291560	2294280	situation.
2294280	2297760	Beck is pointing at the device.
2297760	2298760	You have one.
2298760	2299760	Yeah.
2299760	2304840	I mean, we got them, they got them, but it's kind of like the government's scared to like
2304840	2309640	tell people so they want to expose it so that they're the bad guys that gets everybody scared
2309640	2312320	and then we can just make it normal.
2312320	2314760	What's, what's bad about these?
2314760	2315760	In my mind?
2315760	2316760	Uh, nothing.
2316760	2317760	Do you feel that?
2317760	2318760	Yeah.
2318760	2319760	Okay.
2319960	2321800	Why does Godel have to be the bad guy?
2321800	2325800	Oh, because you know, some people are like, don't be God.
2325800	2331160	And so they can, if, Hey, if it's all good stuff, then Godel, that's good.
2331160	2333840	If it's all bad stuff, then it's not us.
2333840	2334840	That's good.
2334840	2336520	It turns out it's good.
2336520	2337520	Everybody.
2337520	2338520	It's good for everybody.
2338520	2341600	Cow's looking at X. What power is this?
2341600	2348760	Oh, um, well, we're not like, like just hope.
2348760	2350660	Like the humanity's hope.
2350660	2354480	He looks at X to see if that was a good answer or not.
2354480	2359400	She's just kind of looking back at you with like, uh, as good as any.
2359400	2361560	How do you get that hope out of a human?
2361560	2366800	Oh no, no, it's, um, nothing so sinister.
2366800	2368680	We just don't know.
2368680	2370880	But do you suspect?
2370880	2374440	Well, Otherwise, what's wrong with the skin graft
2374440	2375440	2000?
2375440	2377320	It seems like a miracle technology.
2377440	2383640	Godel wouldn't be a bad guy if he released this, unless there's something sinister about
2383640	2384640	it.
2384640	2390400	Well, Nope, I guess you're wrong about that.
2390400	2393400	Can I come at that?
2393400	2394400	Yeah.
2394400	2395400	94.
2395400	2396400	39.
2396400	2402280	Cow's like, well, I have been wrong before.
2402280	2409120	Well, it's like, you know how you feel right now, the explanation that like, we don't know
2409120	2413120	and how that makes you feel, but that's going to be everybody.
2413120	2415440	And they're going to be mad about that.
2415440	2419220	I'm still a little confused, like how you have one, is he like a military contractor
2419220	2421920	and you got a hold of their part of their contract?
2421920	2426120	Did the Godels make one specifically for one for the military?
2426120	2428000	How mass produced are these things?
2428000	2431680	Those are all big questions, Mr. Wilder.
2432080	2436240	Yeah, I would say that, you know what you're talking about.
2436240	2437240	Thanks.
2437240	2438240	Absolutely.
2438240	2439240	Yeah.
2439240	2445920	I, uh, I, I've got this one and, uh, I do know that if I, if something were to happen
2445920	2449840	to it, I probably wouldn't, you know, it'd be hard to get a replacement.
2449840	2451760	You know what I mean?
2451760	2456400	Do you have other stuff that Godels have engineered?
2456440	2463840	Dr. Murray is looking at X and X is looking at Dr. Murray and X kind of gives it a reluctant
2463840	2471720	nod and Dr. Murray is like, Oh yeah, like, like what?
2471720	2479000	I mean, I don't, I don't have the, um, necessarily the, uh, authorization to get into it, but,
2479400	2489080	I don't want to undersell you, but if you can imagine it, it can possibly be done now.
2489080	2491640	Like a machine that makes cappuccinos on demand?
2491640	2492640	Done.
2492640	2493640	Well, we already did.
2493640	2494640	Yes.
2494640	2499640	We already, uh, yeah, we already did that on all of the NPCs.
2499640	2500640	Okay.
2500640	2501640	Cow's like, yeah.
2501640	2502640	Yeah.
2502640	2503640	Beck.
2503640	2508640	I mean, we had one in the lobby for quite a while until, well, you remember, you kind
2508680	2510440	of knocked it over with your camera.
2510440	2512440	Oh, it scared me.
2512440	2513440	Yeah.
2513440	2514440	Yeah.
2514440	2515440	Yeah.
2515440	2523080	I told you there's no, yes.
2523080	2525080	And I told you there's nothing to fear.
2525080	2530080	It's just a cappuccino maker.
2530080	2532080	All right.
2532080	2536120	Well, uh, you said anything I could think of, it's what I think everyone knows what I can
2536120	2537120	think of.
2537560	2538560	Another one of those.
2538560	2540560	No, no, no, no, no.
2540560	2547560	Dr. Murray X, can we have Dr. Murray's thing for our dangerous mission to find God?
2547560	2549760	You seem to have plenty.
2549760	2553360	You cannot fucking touch my, uh, my device here.
2553360	2554760	Seems like you answer to her.
2554760	2555760	Yes.
2555760	2556760	Uh, you cannot have her device.
2556760	2559760	Uh, Dr. Murray, that will be all.
2559760	2560760	Thank you so much for your time.
2560760	2566600	Can I human that to see if she's lying and that we can have it?
2567080	2575080	I want to try a persuade role X please.
2575080	2581080	91 critical success.
2581080	2585080	Dr. Murray, it's always a pleasure.
2585080	2586080	Yeah.
2586080	2587080	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2587080	2588080	Of course.
2588080	2592080	I hope you're feeling better and, uh, everyone, uh, feel good and stuff.
2592560	2594560	Don't, don't have any need for me.
2594560	2595560	Okay.
2595560	2598160	But if you do, I'll be just right around for you.
2598160	2599160	If we do.
2599160	2600160	Do you have a card?
2600160	2604280	Is there a way to get ahold of you?
2604280	2605280	And she shuts the door.
2605280	2610240	She opens the door real quick and she goes, Oh, I forgot to tell you that it was a crazy
2610240	2611240	fucking night.
2611240	2612240	Last night.
2612240	2619320	I found a parallel.
2619560	2632400	A pair of legs, lambs, lobsters, a paradise.
2632400	2638800	You found a paradise where, where was the paradise?
2638800	2639800	What is happening?
2639800	2641720	Dr. Murray, did you forget to tell us anything?
2641720	2642720	She's having a stroke.
2642720	2643720	She's just standing there.
2643720	2646000	I told you they're weird.
2646000	2649100	It's like she came back to ask for help.
2649880	2650880	You couldn't get it out.
2650880	2651880	She's just standing there.
2651880	2652880	Stuck frozen.
2652880	2655980	Hey Julius, could I have my makeup kit back?
2655980	2659780	Oh, he never looked at his face, but he, he gives it back.
2659780	2662780	Cow gives it like a quick kiss and is like, how are you doing old girl?
2662780	2666780	And slips it in his coat pocket.
2666780	2667780	Legs.
2672780	2673780	What?
2673780	2678340	That's the, that's the first thing I said, and not even just one, but two, can we talk
2678340	2684700	about how you didn't say anything for like 10 minutes, two sets of legs and a top half.
2684700	2685700	It was nuts.
2685700	2686700	It was a woman.
2686700	2691540	I, it was a, no, I mean, obviously not one of the halves, a whole, whole woman had a
2691540	2693060	wild story in this whole time.
2693060	2697660	She's just poking her head out back into the door of Julius and X's place.
2697660	2699980	I, yeah, it was a, it was last night.
2699980	2702020	It was absolutely naughty.
2702020	2704820	Total cleanup over at the zeitgeist.
2704820	2706300	There was people in half.
2706300	2707300	Yeah.
2708260	2713020	Like two bottom halves and one top half is very weird.
2713020	2714020	It was very strange.
2714020	2715020	Did they see what happened?
2715020	2718420	Well, I mean, there was a woman there and she was like all sorts of wild.
2718420	2721120	I won't say a name, but what was her name?
2721120	2723780	She was a fine girl.
2723780	2725580	And tell us the initials.
2725580	2728060	She was telling me about this dirty girl.
2728060	2734580	Apparently like went into another person, like inside the tum tum of another person
2734580	2741140	is what she got eaten, like, but like in, like sucked into the belly or whatever.
2741140	2745500	And then like somebody else was punched in half, uh, it's happened at the bar.
2745500	2746500	Yeah.
2746500	2747500	No, no, no.
2747500	2748500	At the zeitgeist.
2748500	2749500	Oh shit.
2749500	2750820	What was the bar called?
2750820	2751820	The printing press.
2751820	2752820	No, that's the drink.
2752820	2753820	Where are we?
2753820	2754820	We're at bucky kid's bar.
2754820	2755820	No, the first bar.
2755820	2756820	The foundry.
2756820	2757820	The foundry.
2757820	2758820	Sorry.
2758820	2759820	I was confused.
2759820	2763700	The zeitgeist is the city's famous secret spot to me.
2763700	2764700	Space Needle.
2764700	2765700	I think you just call them Space Needles.
2765700	2768420	They don't have another name, do they?
2768420	2773380	Um, not that I know of, I think it's just called a small Space Needle.
2773380	2778180	Well, last time I was up there, it didn't look like anybody been up there in forever.
2778180	2779180	Was it inside?
2779180	2781820	No, it was actually down on the ground.
2781820	2782860	Huh?
2782860	2784580	It's our city's famous spire.
2784580	2789260	Oh, yes, of course a spire.
2789260	2793820	My uh, my wife and I had our first date in the rotating restaurant.
2793820	2797020	Damn, you are old.
2797020	2800420	Yes, Julius.
2800420	2803340	Damn it.
2803340	2807740	Yes, I am.
2807740	2810580	Was it cool or was it like gimmicky?
2810580	2815060	Cal's eyes get misty and he like looks into the distance and a single tear rolls down
2815060	2818620	his cheek and he says, it was very cool.
2818620	2824820	Yeah, Julius honestly thought it was probably gimmicky until he just heard that and now
2824820	2831500	he longs to have been able to go to the rotating restaurant.
2831500	2832500	Top class.
2832500	2837740	So, like, did you fix them or clean them up?
2837740	2838740	What happened?
2838740	2840580	Well, I didn't fix the halfs, no.
2840580	2841580	Does that thing?
2841580	2843500	Yeah, would it fix a half?
2843500	2845500	How much can that thing grow back?
2845500	2849140	Oh, not like a half on half, although.
2849140	2853340	And she gets a weird look in her eye and she goes, actually, gotta go and slams the door
2853340	2854340	open.
2854340	2860420	Son of a bitch, that thing rehaves halves.
2860420	2861420	What the?
2861420	2865340	That thing refools halves.
2865340	2871540	I mean, I know we're focused on finding God, but like we drew the dots and it's nothing.
2871540	2873300	What if we go check out the halves?
2873300	2874980	I think we should go.
2874980	2879780	I mean, we got two days until we can run the scratch fixer 2000 or what our skin graft
2879780	2880780	2000.
2880780	2884060	We've got the nerds working on this on the, on the, on the read it.
2884060	2885060	Yeah.
2885060	2890460	And then, I mean, we also got, we got other programmers out there fixing the holes or
2890460	2892100	something, right X?
2892100	2893100	Yes.
2893100	2894100	Let's go.
2894100	2895100	We can get a new news story about the halves.
2895100	2896100	Yeah.
2896100	2898900	We can make a whole like other story, the B block.
2898900	2903220	I mean, a dirty girl going into someone's belly.
2903220	2908660	It sounds like it's related to our whole thing.
2908660	2914100	The story can be called like, uh, it's like half, but it's like one over Z cause it happened
2914100	2915100	at the zeitgeist.
2915100	2916100	Sure.
2916100	2917100	Yeah.
2917100	2918100	We'll think about that.
2918100	2922100	We'll get the graphic department on there.
2922100	2923100	Yeah.
2923100	2924100	Yeah.
2924100	2925100	The two, that's amazing.
2925100	2927260	Z, I get it.
2927260	2928260	And it's halves.
2928260	2929260	Okay.
2929260	2930260	Yeah.
2930260	2931260	I was going to be the producer one day.
2931260	2932260	Yeah.
2932300	2933300	I was going to be the producer.
2933300	2934300	You're a pretty good producer.
2934300	2938640	X, do you know anything about these halves?
2938640	2946680	Not anything exactly about the halves, but Julius, you did tell me about someone else
2946680	2952620	claiming that someone was trying to get into someone else's stomach.
2952620	2955340	Their names were like silver and gold or something.
2955340	2956340	Yeah.
2956340	2959000	And there was, uh, beer, uh, something to do with beer involved.
2959000	2960000	I remember that.
2960000	2964120	It's only been a few weeks, but it feels like almost a year ago.
2964120	2965340	Yeah.
2965340	2968040	I wonder whatever happened with that.
2968040	2969220	Google it Julius.
2969220	2970760	Google Kaylee silver.
2970760	2971760	Yeah.
2971760	2972760	When you Google Kaylee silver.
2972760	2974600	Well, I mean, I'll need some help here.
2974600	2977160	How long do these things take to go to trial?
2977160	2978160	Oh, to trial?
2978160	2979160	Depends.
2979160	2985360	How about I just finished up.
2985360	2987080	Cal's reading the article over your shoulder.
2987080	2989840	He's like, wow, that was fast.
2989840	2995080	If there's one thing about the city, it's the kind of lack of crazy crime.
2995080	2996080	That's usually our thing.
2996080	2997080	Yeah.
2997080	2998080	Swift justice.
2998080	2999080	What?
2999080	3000080	Yeah.
3000080	3003640	What do I find about Kaylee silver?
3003640	3009040	I guess let's, uh, let's roll on whether or not she's had her just 50 50.
3009040	3010040	Yeah.
3010040	3011040	What do I want?
3011040	3012040	High or low?
3012040	3013040	Well, it depends if you roll low.
3013040	3018080	We'll say that she already had her court date and if you roll high, it hasn't happened yet.
3018080	3019080	Yep.
3019320	3020320	Yeah.
3020320	3021320	Rolled high.
3021320	3023080	So hasn't happened yet.
3023080	3025640	Hasn't happened yet, which is much more realistic.
3025640	3026640	Yeah.
3026640	3029520	She is currently, uh, in the system has not posted bail.
3029520	3032640	There was like a crazy high bail posts for someone.
3032640	3033640	Sure.
3033640	3034640	Sure.
3034640	3035640	For doing that.
3035640	3038560	If you guys want it, we, we, we could maybe like set up an interview with her.
3038560	3039560	Yeah.
3039560	3044400	Let's, I'd like to go check out Z and see if, I mean, if that fucking lady is the one
3044400	3047240	that found it, she didn't clean them up probably.
3047240	3048240	Yeah.
3048400	3049400	Yeah.
3049400	3050400	They might still be there.
3050400	3052400	She might've missed a half or two.
3052400	3056880	We should probably go check Z out first and then, uh, then maybe, maybe Kaylee can help
3056880	3058680	us fill in any gaps.
3058680	3059680	Yeah.
3059680	3062500	Can news away.
3062500	3063500	Pleasure meeting you X.
3063500	3069120	The pleasure was, and she looks at Cal Colorado, all mine.
3069120	3071880	Lady I used to want to ask you out, but now you scare me.
3071880	3073840	Good day.
3073880	3080000	On the way out of the house, uh, Julius like, um, stops and looks and it's the only like
3080000	3084120	picture in the house, the only piece of artwork or anything.
3084120	3090520	And it's just a framed picture of him and this guy with like long black stringy hair
3090520	3095000	and like three long whiskers on his chin.
3095000	3101440	And he looks at it and he kind of a bittersweet like head nod and then walks out of the house.
3101440	3103800	Hey Julius, who's that creepy guy?
3103800	3109800	Julius, uh, with that question, literally doesn't know what you're talking about.
3134800	3141680	Well, there was that thing that happened on the other side of the city a few years ago,
3141680	3146440	you know, with that crime Lord and his weird arena of death.
3146440	3148840	That feels like it was hundreds of years ago to me.
3148840	3150480	It was worked in the future.
3150480	3154400	It was pre pandemic, which hasn't happened yet.
3154400	3156600	Wait, this was 2022.
3156600	3157600	Oh yeah.
3157600	3159600	The big one hasn't happened yet.
3159600	3160600	What?
3161000	3162000	What?
3162000	3163000	What?
3177000	3178800	I'm a big fan of eating those just raw.
