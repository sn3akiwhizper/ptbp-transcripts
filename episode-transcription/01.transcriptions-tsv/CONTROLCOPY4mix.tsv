0	4600	It's your Dimension Super Heavyweight Champion, Wolf the Dog.
4600	12680	And I'm here to do some big punches live from 694.2 PTBP.
12680	19800	Prepare your skulls to be pummeled by my beautiful voice and maybe my nasty fists.
19800	22440	If you start acting up, that is.
22440	26640	Now, I ain't pulling no punches here with this week's Howlin' with Wolf.
26680	30240	It's from AtAlchemistBBQ on Twitter.
30240	31320	They write,
31320	37720	Hey PTBP crew, thank you for inspiring me to run my own Delta Green game.
37720	44440	Whether dealing with aliens, time travel, yeetin' babies, or stealing microwaves,
44440	48680	there's not been a dull moment while handling the bastard's crew.
48680	54480	I look forward to the next arc post-contention for more inspiration.
54520	59120	Just sure hope that all these games aren't secretly a summonin' ritual,
59120	64880	allowin' the tendrils of the crawlin' chaos to manifest in our world.
64880	66840	What are the odds of that?
67720	69440	What the fuck is a yeet?
70080	73800	Thanks for writin', AlchemicalBBQ pitmaster.
73800	80200	I still don't know what you people all mean by these games that people are runnin'.
80200	84280	I only report on what is happenin' in real life.
84280	86360	The great IRL.
86360	91720	Now, if you wanna write up something for your heavyweight champion Wolf to Hal,
91720	96520	please send your messages as a five-star review on Apple Podcasts.
96520	100920	And I'll read it here on 694.2 PTBP,
100920	107760	the newest and only radio station wherever I happen to be next.
107760	111400	And speaking of next, here's an announcement.
111440	115520	Whoa, this here is the finale of Control Copy.
115520	119960	So strap in for safety, my restrained pups, and hold on tight.
119960	121520	We're gonna take a week off.
121520	126280	If all goes as planned, we'll be back on Friday, January 28th,
126280	129400	with the kickoff of a brand new short story.
129400	131520	I'm sure you have questions.
131520	133120	Will it be Delta Green?
133120	134000	Yes.
134000	136480	Will it be written and handled by Zack?
136480	137600	Yes, again.
137600	141280	Will it have an entirely new set of players?
141280	144480	Whoa, yes, yes.
144480	148000	Allie, Lindsey, and Taylor will be back,
148000	152120	returning after their acclaimed run in the woods of contention.
152120	155760	And they will be joined by a secret special guest.
155760	157800	And if you can guess who it is,
157800	161560	I'll say your internet name live on air.
161560	163440	All right, that's enough news.
163440	165360	It's time for the news.
165360	171000	Just now, a corpse washed up on 34th Street Beach in Ocean City.
171000	175440	The body is horribly disfigured and the eye sockets are empty.
175440	177840	The skin has mostly sloughed off,
177840	181440	but witnesses at the scene say the corpse has a long,
181440	185320	knotted scar up the right side of its face.
185320	188000	Hmm, who else have I heard of recently
188000	190160	that had a scar like that?
190160	191280	Oh, that's right.
191280	196160	It was Arvin Chilton's landlord, Alexander Duchesne.
196160	200600	But if this waterlogged carcass is Duchesne,
200600	204600	then who or what is in Duchesne's apartment?
204600	208480	Now, for the last and most on-the-nose time,
208480	213280	give it up for Brian Bulger with Bad in a Good Way.
213280	220080	Feels like I'm on the last bend of the deep end
220080	223880	But the drowning's been just fine
223880	228280	And when my ears pop and the shell shock
228280	232280	Of this pit stop frees my mind
232280	236280	I'll be all right, I can go there
236280	240280	Now that I stare, death in the face
240280	244280	I'll be all right, I can go there
244280	248280	Now that I stare, death in the face
250280	251880	What's up, everybody?
251880	253080	Oh, that was pretty good.
253080	254880	Do you want to give it a...
254880	256080	What's up, everybody?
256080	258280	Do you guys want to give it a quick go of like,
258280	259880	it's Zach, I'm Zach?
259880	261080	Do you want to?
261080	263080	It's Zach, I'm Zach.
263080	264680	Oh, it's Zach, oh, I'm Zach.
264680	265480	Oh, no.
265480	266880	That's what it sounds like to me every time.
266880	269280	Oh, no.
269280	272280	God, God.
272280	273280	Well, how close was I?
273280	274480	You were over.
274480	275280	By how much?
275280	276080	Like four seconds.
276080	277280	Were you rushing?
277280	278280	Were you rushing?
278280	279080	Or were you dragging?
279080	280680	I was dragging.
280680	283880	Dragging these nuts across your face.
283880	287080	God damn it.
287080	289080	At the end of the last episode,
289080	291480	you all made an alertness check.
291480	295680	Two of you passed and the last thing you heard was rain.
295680	296680	But what a wild up.
296680	298080	I mean, so much happened.
298080	299680	Oh, my gosh.
299680	301680	Really the most we've ever...
301680	302880	The most land covered?
302880	304280	So much distance covered.
304280	306880	So much plot covered.
306880	309680	If you guys were on Find My iPhone
309680	311880	and you were tracking each and every one of you,
311880	314480	I'm not sure much would have changed
314480	315880	during the last episode.
315880	316480	Oh, no.
316480	317480	Yeah, I couldn't pinpoint it.
317480	319680	It's not going to pinpoint that closely.
319680	321080	We went above.
321080	323680	We went upstairs.
323680	326080	Yeah, we could be in the exact same dot location,
326080	327880	just one story above.
328680	329880	Find My iPhone can't tell you that.
329880	330480	Maybe it can.
330480	334080	I've never used it in like a tall building.
334080	335680	We don't have many of those around here.
335680	337880	We really don't.
337880	339280	We're from Springfield, Missouri
339280	340680	if you're listening to this
340680	342080	and you haven't heard us before.
342080	343680	It doesn't matter, tall building or not.
343680	345280	I've never used it on a second floor.
345280	347680	Okay, so I recently used it on a second floor
347680	348880	to find Taylor's phone.
348880	350880	Did it say it's on the second floor?
350880	352280	Nope.
352280	354080	There you go.
354080	356080	How many stories is the Hammond's Tower?
356080	356880	16?
356880	357880	Yeah, 69.
357880	359480	1669.
359480	362080	That's where I grew up.
362080	363080	Go there.
363080	363880	Doc Zach in the past.
363880	365080	Go there right now.
365080	365880	Past docs.
365880	368880	Oh, I do have to actually delete that probably.
368880	369880	Because people will go there.
369880	371080	It probably could be used for an interview.
371080	374480	It could be used as like an old address number.
374480	376680	Or they could go murder the people that bought that house.
376680	377280	Right.
377280	379880	All right, let's bail, bail, bail, bail.
379880	380880	And it's raining.
380880	382880	So we passed alertness rules,
382880	384080	but all we heard was rain.
384080	384680	I know.
384680	386280	And I'm going to tell you, I met a game tier.
386280	386680	Yeah.
386680	388280	You said, was the highest 114?
388280	389080	And I said, yeah.
389080	390880	Which means it was an opposed roll.
390880	392480	Oh, interesting.
392480	393880	I wonder who we were opposing.
393880	394880	We're doing a fair amount of meta gaming here
394880	396880	at the end of this scenario.
396880	400480	So we know this thing can create some kind of false reality
400480	402480	or even shield.
402480	405280	It prevents things around it from sensing it, right?
405280	407080	Because it killed that gas station attendant.
407080	410480	In full view of that witness who thought they heard something,
410480	412480	like it looks like they almost hear something,
412480	416480	but then they just turn around, like walk away.
416880	422080	So yeah, good meta gaming Joe.
422080	424280	I hadn't put that together.
424280	426080	Roll sanity, Luke.
426080	427880	Just for Luke.
427880	431280	I fail.
431280	433280	Luke's eyes just got so big.
433280	435080	Yeah, he hit a breaking point.
435080	436680	Put them back in your eye.
436680	440280	I'm obsessed with vaping now.
440280	442680	And being a little stinker.
442880	446880	What a horrible mania to take.
446880	449880	Well, he's a little stinker.
449880	453880	All right, let's dive in and let's cover ground.
453880	454480	We'll see.
454480	455480	GPS wise.
455480	456880	What about Nikomania?
456880	463880	And I'm addicted to nicotine and the Velvet Underground.
463880	464680	Boom.
464680	467680	Great one.
467680	468680	If it was called Nikotine.
468680	471880	As you guys have been reading through the phone of Arvin
471880	479180	Chilton, you have found this phone number that was called
479180	482980	twice. Once the day after the McCarty murders and once the
482980	488680	day of the Quentin Harris murder, but previous to that gas
488680	493880	station attendant being murdered and you hear rain outside.
493880	495080	Okay, I look out the window.
495080	495780	Is it raining?
496280	496680	Yes.
497680	500780	Hey Sparrow, do you want to call this number?
500780	502380	I don't think I should do the talking.
502580	502880	Yeah.
502880	503380	All right.
504780	505180	Yeah.
507380	513480	Just feels like we should be running downstairs, but at least
513480	517780	check the bathroom that we did see the dirt trail didn't go
517780	517980	to it.
517980	519380	I have to pee Elwood.
520080	521080	Oh Jesus.
521080	522880	Do you ask me permission to pee?
525880	527580	Joe, Joe, what happened for the story?
528180	529280	Somebody needs to check the bathroom.
529780	530480	I got a pee.
530480	531480	Is it really bad?
531980	534580	Number one, number one bad.
534580	535680	Scale of one to ten.
539080	540080	So you can't hold it.
540080	542580	He's hopping around and it's like making the whole house.
542580	543980	Oh, you look like you're about to pop.
543980	544680	Get in there.
544680	545080	Go.
545280	546280	I go to the bathroom.
550380	552280	There's nothing abnormal in the bathroom.
552580	553180	Ought one.
553180	554580	I get it right in the toilet.
554580	560180	You wasted an ought one on pissing.
560180	563280	Yeah, incredible piss.
563280	566180	He feels he feels like a spring in his step.
566180	570380	Maybe like he's got an extra awareness or something about
570380	575180	it. Plus twenty to any role that you would like during this
575180	579380	episode because of how well I just pissed incredible.
579380	582280	I wash my hands, but you have to tell me before you roll that
582280	583380	you want to use your plus twenty.
583380	588380	I wash my hands and slowly walk out of the bathroom.
588580	590280	So yeah, did you want to call this number or are we just
590280	591280	going to leave it be?
591380	594080	Yeah, she was about to but then she heard like what was
594080	597480	obviously the clearest like most perfect piss hitting the
597480	598480	center of a toilet.
599880	600880	It dazed you.
600880	602180	Yeah, this is an Andre giant.
602180	605380	So it's like it's kind of like a getting a fire hose like
605380	605880	stream in there.
605880	609580	Maybe I would assume I picked up my dice tray and I showed
609580	610280	it to Joe.
611180	613180	I saw that you want me to share what it was or you want to
613180	614980	keep it. So I didn't share what I rolled.
614980	618580	It was a 69 or we don't know.
618580	622280	Well, so every time so yeah, I think I kind of know.
624980	629580	Yeah, so agent Sparrow calls that number bring bring bring
629580	636780	bring bring bring bring bring bring bring bring bring bring
636780	641980	bring bring bring it rings until you think it's the last
641980	645080	possible second before it's going to go to voicemail.
645480	646080	She hangs up.
651680	656280	Totally kidding Arvin you goddamn son of a bitch.
656280	658480	What the fuck did you do?
658980	660680	What did you do?
661080	661480	Hello.
662780	663780	This is not Arvin.
664480	666380	My name is Clarissa Sparrow.
667080	668280	What did Arvin do to you?
668380	669280	Who are you?
669680	670780	Who are you?
671080	672080	Someone who's trying to help.
672080	673480	How do you have this phone?
674080	674980	Arvin dropped it.
675080	676080	We don't know where he is.
676080	677080	We're worried for him.
677080	678480	Worried for him?
678680	682480	Be worried for the death wake that he left behind you.
683180	685580	Be worried for my fucking brother.
685580	685980	Okay.
685980	686180	Yeah.
686180	688180	So that's kind of I didn't know if you were really on his
688180	689080	side or not.
689380	691880	Seems like not right.
691880	694380	Yeah, so you're not neither are we we're not worried for him.
694380	695580	We're trying to stop him.
695680	696980	He killed my brother.
697280	698380	He killed Quentin.
698680	700380	That was the gas station attendant.
701580	703380	Yeah, interesting.
703380	705680	He called you two days before your brother died.
706780	707680	How do you know Arvin?
709380	712680	My brother knew Arvin back in 01.
713280	715180	You know him from the Steel Hill home.
715780	717180	The Steel Hill home.
717880	721180	Yeah, it was this fucked up fucking cult that my brother
721180	722180	got stuck in.
723680	725480	They trapped him there.
725780	728480	It tricked him told him the world was different than what
728480	730180	it is and he fucked with them.
730180	734080	It changed him different how he wasn't able to focus on
734080	734580	anything.
734580	736180	He was not able to be inside.
736180	736980	He was different.
736980	737780	Sorry, not your brother.
737780	739480	How did they say the world was different?
739980	744080	No, I don't listen to the endless nonsense that came out
744080	747680	of his me and Arvin close after that.
747780	751080	I didn't even know that Arvin was a part of it until he
751080	751980	called me.
752380	753980	What did you talk about when he called you?
754580	756480	I didn't even know him.
756480	757880	I didn't even know his name.
758180	761080	He's just sound like an old friend who would lost touch
761380	769480	and I just mean to told him where Quentin was.
769480	771280	Yeah, cuz he lied to you.
771280	774180	Yeah, he told you he was somebody else.
779180	786280	What did he say to you the next time he called what did
786280	794680	he say I'm gonna kill she did he say anything like oh,
794680	795480	I'm gonna kill him.
795880	802480	Oh, that's a fail on the sanity check from hearing even
802480	806980	a mimicry of the sound that you heard from Arvin Chilton
807280	811480	that horrible day the worst day of this man's life.
811580	820080	And he weeps and weeps and you hear him set down the phone
820180	823880	and then you hear him kind of walk away and he's just crying.
824680	826980	Okay, so I hang up I dial again.
826980	839680	Sir, hello.
844880	848880	You're gonna fucking laugh at me when you meet for me for
848880	851680	gay. No, I swear to God.
851680	852480	I'm not laughing.
852480	855280	I'm trying very hard not to laugh at your me me me's.
856280	859180	He lost his sanity check, so he's not going to be much use
859180	860480	anymore. Okay.
860480	863680	What was the name of that cult Steel Hill home?
866680	869580	All right, let's go check on Mr.
869580	870080	Duchesne.
874580	877880	My God is actually just keep rolling for these cops to be
877880	878680	brutalized.
878680	882980	I think he did the cops kick his ass.
882980	883880	Whoo doggy.
884780	886180	Yeah, the scenario is wrapped up now.
887280	888880	They took care of it outside for us.
888880	891380	Well, they were they really wanted to bully somebody some
891380	892980	more like they got it.
892980	895180	They really got it into them with Kevin and they're like
895380	896980	this old man is going to be easy to pick on.
896980	898380	Let's just beat the shit out of him.
899780	903580	I also like the picturing like cop cars and bodies flying
903580	904980	by the windows outside.
906580	907780	We're like it's raining.
907880	911480	It's raining tentacle laps against the window.
912980	916180	It's really coming down.
916180	916480	Yeah.
916480	916880	Wow.
919680	920280	We're going downstairs.
920280	920580	Aren't we?
920680	921080	Yep.
921480	925080	All right marching order, please Kevin go down first.
927780	931480	All righty for the first time Clarissa is kind of behind
931480	935780	Kevin to like she's seen Elwood do so many times we can share
935780	937880	him. I'll be at the very back.
937980	941280	Yeah now like you're actively crouching behind her to now
941280	945580	and like your hand is occasionally on her shoulder like
945580	949080	pushing her into a more like wow, this guy's Weasley.
950380	953680	I go down the stairs are the cops still outside as you're
953680	954980	going down the stairs.
954980	957980	You see no police officers outside.
957980	962680	Whereas before you would have seen six police officers outside
962680	965980	and how many were inside there were two inside other cars
965980	967880	gone their cars are not gone.
968080	971080	No, I didn't expect it would be those mean.
971080	972780	Cops are going to be inside.
973980	975580	I open the door.
978580	981180	Go ahead and roll sanity all of us.
981280	983980	Yeah 97 I fail.
985780	987280	I crit succeed.
987280	988480	Oh, wow.
988480	991480	The only one who's going to lose zero sanity here probably
992080	993580	85 on a now 80.
996080	998380	Failing failing crit succeed.
998380	1003780	So at the Chris exceed Elwood Boyd, he's fucking free.
1004380	1009780	There's like something in him that just represses all of
1009780	1014180	this sanity loss down to absolutely nothing.
1014180	1017180	Whereas the the other the other two of you.
1020980	1021780	How much?
1021880	1025680	Who's tensing today?
1025680	1028580	Hi, that's my breaking point for sure.
1032080	1034080	Elwood what's wrong with you?
1034580	1038880	I mean seemingly a lot because the Duchesne home is an
1038880	1043880	abattoir a slaughterhouse and the smell of spilled blood
1043880	1048680	and flesh both rotting and fresh penetrates your nostrils
1048880	1054680	like an unwelcome houseguest as you all notice there's been
1054680	1058980	a distinct vibe switch in this withering old man's apartment.
1059280	1064580	It's as if a merciful veil has been cruelly lifted and the
1064580	1069580	reality of your situation begins to sink in as you stare
1069580	1076080	into the face of Arvin Chilton the target of your mission
1076180	1080780	and you know deep down in the sickening turmoil that's brewing
1080780	1086680	in your guts that you never spoke to Alexander Duchesne
1086680	1091080	at all. Arvin Chilton looks like his photograph but a version
1091080	1095480	that has been completely lost to madness his hair darts
1095480	1100080	in every direction akimbo like his eyes any visible skin
1100180	1104880	is covered in scratches and dried blood and the often mended
1104880	1109180	clothes that wrapped around the short stout landlord now
1109180	1114980	hang awkwardly from his tenants tall gaunt frame the whole
1114980	1118880	confusing and unnatural switcheroo situation is topped by
1118880	1122980	the same old pork pie cat dawned by what had appeared to
1122980	1127480	be Alexander Duchesne, but Arvin Chilton isn't the only
1127480	1129880	horribly unfamiliar thing in this room.
1130080	1136680	The walls are now or always were painted in human blood
1136880	1142380	dirty hands spread and shaped the gore like gruesome finger
1142380	1147880	paint into the symbol of the testament of new flesh displayed
1147880	1153180	man seen on the side of the Ocean City Cafe human body parts
1153180	1157480	are strewn throughout this place a loose tongue here a sole
1157480	1161980	foot there a length of dripping intestines is draped over
1161980	1167380	a stained lampshade and in some cases you recognize instances
1167380	1171380	where your eyes must have lied before the ashtray on the
1171380	1177380	coffee table is now a Glock 17 wet with vital fluids the
1177380	1182180	two mops are now Mossberg shotguns where there were once
1182180	1187480	five baseballs placed randomly around there are now four
1187780	1194680	M67 grenades and the food that's still sitting out my fucking
1194680	1195480	God dude.
1195480	1197580	He stole that straight from David Winters.
1197580	1198480	What is it?
1198580	1199380	What is it?
1199380	1200980	How did you eat the next time?
1200980	1204380	We had an opportunity at the very next time.
1204780	1205980	How did you fall for that?
1206780	1211280	Guess what the olives are eyeballs eyeballs and guess what
1211280	1218780	the thin cuts of meat were penises flesh human flesh and
1218780	1223580	slices and there's a mound of chewed up human flesh.
1223580	1225280	Oh my God.
1225680	1232580	So I need another sanity check point from both Elwood Boyd
1232580	1238280	fail again and Kevin gelato for having eaten eyes and flesh
1238280	1239080	that one's a fail.
1239080	1245080	You're gonna lose three more sanity each of you and you are
1245080	1251480	overcome with uncontrollable vomiting for a number of turns
1251780	1254580	equal to the loss three turns.
1254780	1260480	So for three full turns the only action you can take is yacking.
1260580	1264980	Oh and one more change in the scene dressing the copy of as
1264980	1268980	you like it that's sitting on the table as I lay dying.
1269080	1277980	It was just a book.
1278080	1279280	It's a title changed.
1279280	1286480	That was all seems to be a diary of some sort some sort of
1286480	1291480	leather-bound diary is the leather made out of humans.
1291980	1294080	I feel like that seems obvious.
1294180	1296780	So no, it's just a diary.
1296780	1298580	The horse meat diary.
1299380	1300880	Yeah, not not horse leather.
1300880	1308680	No horse meat diary rotting flesh and finally at the feet
1308680	1314580	of Arvin Chilton in a pool of their own blood are seven bodies
1315080	1320280	each with their throat slit all uniformed police officers
1320280	1326680	because I fuck you not he out rolled all eight.
1327380	1328680	Police officers.
1328680	1332680	So I don't doubt that but and then he rolled a 69.
1332680	1336080	Yeah, but what so he's in front of seven bodies and the
1336080	1336980	eighth one.
1337580	1342580	He has this cop by the back of the neck and this cop is staring
1342580	1349380	at the three of you with eyes that make you think maybe he's
1349380	1353580	not looking at you even though his eyes are pointed in that
1353580	1360680	direction and as Arvin, let's go of this body you see he's
1360680	1366080	been holding this long knife that has a weird Bend on the
1366080	1370780	end of it this crooked knife and this cop just slides off
1370780	1374880	the end of it and face plants into the ground in front of
1374880	1376880	you speaking of eyes.
1376880	1377680	How are the bodies looking?
1377680	1381680	Are they are they eyeful or eyeless so far only two of them
1381680	1384980	are our eyeless cool that weird knife.
1384980	1387480	He's got that look like an eye shucking knife.
1388980	1392380	So let's work in dexterity order.
1393280	1396780	I believe Elwood Boyd is up first Elwood.
1396880	1398280	Where do you throw up?
1400980	1402480	Just inside just inside the door.
1402480	1404980	I think that's we've lost the sanity because we've peaked
1404980	1409080	in so I'm at least that far inside Kevin gelato normally
1409680	1412780	when someone loses over five sanity in one go we would have
1412780	1414580	you roll fight flight or faint.
1414580	1418480	However due to what is written in the scenario it says that
1418480	1421980	for the next three rounds you are vomiting and so therefore
1421980	1424580	I'm going to use that as your fight flight or faint response
1424580	1426080	if that's cool with you, that's fine.
1426280	1428380	Where are you violently throwing it?
1428380	1431780	I had just stepped right inside the door since I was the
1431780	1435580	first you were the first one in and I step right inside see
1435580	1439780	it all and within seconds just like Jersey burger is coming
1439780	1445580	out of Kevin and the munchy platter whatever that was called
1449080	1452980	projectile vomits everywhere and as that's happening the
1452980	1458880	camera zooms like into his head and Kevin is standing in
1458880	1462380	the middle of a giant Stadium hot bright lights shining
1462380	1466480	down on him the crowd is roaring Kevin is staring across
1466480	1470380	the field giving a menacing look to Tom Brady Tom has a
1470380	1473780	nervous look on his face and sweat is pouring off his forehead
1475580	1479080	hike Kevin rushes through the defensive line and smashes
1479080	1481980	into Brady Brady's head comes clean off his body is the
1481980	1488680	crowd chance man yet man yet Kevin reaches down and grabs
1488680	1491980	Tom Brady's head and holds it up in the air proudly displaying
1491980	1496880	his bloody trophy money begins falling out of the sky
1496880	1501480	as the camera zooms out 40 million dollars for two years.
1501480	1502780	That's crazy, bro.
1503380	1506180	Yeah, I know but I would can't come with me and it makes
1506180	1508580	him it makes us sad.
1509080	1510980	So I don't think I'm going to do it Kev.
1510980	1511980	Are you serious?
1512080	1513180	That's insane.
1514480	1515580	Elwood walks in.
1517380	1520180	We were just talking about Kevin's future football career
1520180	1523280	Elwood sound thinking about that bullshit minion.
1523580	1525080	You're better off here with me.
1525380	1528180	We can do big things together together together and then
1528180	1532380	the camera zooms out to Kevin puking in this living room.
1532480	1536480	Hey Luke, you get 10 luck points for the rest of the scenario.
1536480	1540480	Hell, yeah, basically these are going to be one-to-one for
1540480	1543080	changing any role that you want to make for the rest of your
1543080	1545080	time and I get on you already had plus 20.
1545080	1547180	Oh and you have a plus 20 to a roll.
1547180	1547880	Badass.
1550980	1556280	Agent Sparrow's eyes meet the eyes of Arvin Chilton and they
1556280	1561680	are absolutely crazed standing above eight slumped uniformed
1561780	1564380	ocean shitty PD officers.
1564380	1567280	Hey, man, only people from Ocean Shitty can say that.
1569280	1574380	As the person playing everyone in Ocean City right now.
1576080	1577280	I'm allowed to say it.
1578980	1584180	He's holding a grenade in his hand and the pin has been pulled
1584480	1587880	and his thumb is covering the clip.
1588580	1589880	Roll a five fighter vane.
1589980	1595180	One, two, three, fight, four, five, freeze, and six, flight.
1595280	1596380	What'd you roll, Thomas?
1596580	1597380	I rolled a one.
1597680	1599380	Oh hell yeah, dude.
1599380	1600980	Get that fight going, baby.
1600980	1603980	Agent Sparrow, her eyes are darting around at this whole
1604080	1608180	situation is she's trying to balance her FBI agent mind, her
1608180	1611680	Delta Green agent mind, her student body president agent
1611680	1616880	mind. It all builds to just, I've got to destroy this.
1616880	1619480	Yeah, and she picks up one of the grenades.
1619480	1622180	Yeah, pulls the pin on her own.
1622180	1627380	Oh, yeah, and just tosses it like right towards him and the
1627380	1628480	bucket of dynamite.
1628480	1630080	Oh my God, what?
1631480	1631880	Wow.
1631880	1633080	Oh my God, okay.
1633580	1636580	Joe doesn't know, sticks of dynamite and a grenade all mixed
1636580	1638480	together would take out a block, wouldn't it?
1638480	1645980	So in Delta Green, there is a 15% lethality rating for M67
1645980	1648180	grenades within 10 meters.
1648180	1649080	What about dynamite?
1649080	1654480	Which is easily within this and then within dynamite is going
1654480	1658880	to have a 10% lethality rating within 20 meters.
1658880	1660180	And how many sticks are there?
1660180	1664680	There were 19 sticks of dynamite in this bucket.
1664680	1669080	It is absolutely going to compound and Agent Sparrow has chosen
1669080	1672180	to end this threat.
1672180	1675180	Which is the fucking Delta Green thing to do!
1675180	1677380	I told you I fucking knew how to play Delta Green.
1681880	1688480	Please roll athletics to throw this grenade in an accurate
1688480	1690080	way. How big is this room?
1690080	1690980	Dude, it's tiny.
1690980	1693980	You really don't even have to pass this check for everyone
1693980	1694580	to die.
1699580	1700680	15 on a 30.
1700880	1702980	It lands right in the bucket of dynamite.
1702980	1704780	It lands right in the fucking bucket.
1704780	1709080	You really based on the lethality of 19 sticks of dynamite
1709280	1712680	as well as these two grenades and the other grenades in this
1712680	1714280	room, which is three more.
1714480	1715580	We're all going to die.
1715680	1717780	Yes, before that happens.
1718280	1724280	She takes one last look around at Kevin and Elwood and she's
1724280	1728280	like, man, if we'd gotten three or four more episodes with
1728280	1730180	these characters, I might have really cracked something in
1730180	1735180	that dynamic and help Kevin realize his own potential.
1735580	1738880	That thought manifests as just like a small glint in her
1738880	1744480	eye before the entire room is a ball of light and flame.
1744580	1748280	Elwood as he's puking puts his hand on Kevin's back.
1748380	1752380	Kevin is still throwing up, but he sees the grenade get
1752380	1753080	launched in there.
1753080	1757280	He grabs Elwood and just lays like on top of him to try to
1757580	1760480	prevent Elwood from getting exploded.
1762980	1769480	Maybe the only thing and Andre the Giant from the blast.
1769480	1774280	Okay, let's take a top over.
1774480	1776380	Early Grand Theft Auto.
1776380	1778780	Look at this scene.
1781180	1786780	This two-story duplex fucking explodes.
1787980	1794980	All four cop cars immediately just boom over on their sides.
1795080	1796480	All the cars on the street are
1796480	1807380	step away from the car.
1809980	1812780	I mean, yeah, every window for a couple blocks.
1813180	1815280	Every dog is barking.
1815280	1816580	Twitter is blowing up.
1816580	1817880	Did you guys hear that noise?
1819880	1821480	And yeah, everyone is just a sonic boom.
1821680	1822880	So here's what we're going to do.
1823080	1828080	I'm going to have Luke roll the last roll of the scenario.
1828180	1829780	Don't roll yet, please.
1830680	1834380	You've got a plus 20 on this roll plus 20 plus 10.
1834380	1837280	I'm going to add and you've got a plus 10 due to the luck.
1838180	1844280	And what role do you think would satisfy the requirement
1844580	1850980	of covering the body of Elwood Boyd enough to shelter him
1851480	1854880	from this absolute blast?
1856080	1859180	Just pure will and strength.
1859780	1861580	Strength or athletics a thing, right?
1861580	1861980	Let's see.
1861980	1864380	Like are your constitutes your sheer size?
1864380	1865480	Yeah, like your con.
1865680	1866480	I could do con.
1866480	1867480	All right, let's roll con.
1870480	1872080	91 on a 95.
1876680	1878280	Oh, so wait, we gave you a roll.
1878280	1879280	You could not fail.
1880980	1888580	I rescind my scream for something more dramatic.
1888580	1890280	Is there anything you have at a 70?
1891380	1892680	Well, everything else is at 80.
1892680	1894780	So it would have been just automatic.
1895780	1898280	So that at least gave a little leeway and I saw the nine
1898280	1907780	I was like fuck 91 sirens smoke is fading from the scene
1908480	1911180	red and blue lights cover everything.
1912280	1922280	Red-eyed night shift EMTs begin uncovering 107 East 12th
1922280	1927480	Street Ocean City, New Jersey as they're picking through
1927480	1933780	the rubble they see movement a heaving spine.
1937880	1945580	As Kevin breathes his last breaths his lungs are like popping
1945580	1952580	out of his back and Elwood Boyd pushes his giant bodyguards
1952580	1955780	body off the top of him.

1962480	1968380	Kevin's goggled eyes are staring right into Elwood's eyes.
1969580	1974180	What is going through Elwood Boyd's mind as he looks through
1974680	1980980	the goggles on the corpse of Kevin gelato?
1983580	1984780	Oh, oh Kevin.
1987180	1989880	Well, I'm going to need a new one.
1992480	1996280	Oh, Jesus.

2057380	2062780	Doesn't it always seem like the villain Paul in the strings
2062780	2064780	is a regular guy.
2065780	2071180	You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise.
2073780	2079380	Kerosene wipes clean what we couldn't bear to tarnish.
2081780	2083780	I'll be all right.
2083880	2086480	I can go there now.
2089980	2091980	I'll be all right.
2091980	2094580	I can go there now.
2113780	2136480	There's a conundrum in the wisdom of my spirit.
2137480	2144480	White washed hymns and the deadly sins push me to my limit.
2146480	2152480	When you deconstruct, you shit out of luck for a minute.
2154480	2160480	After the last bend, you can break it all down to rebuild it.

2290480	2296480	Clasp your fist over all the blood.
2296480	2300480	Water leaks through your fingers.
2300480	2306480	You're standing in a swirling flood.
2306480	2311480	And only darkness leaves.
2331480	2337480	Falling fast into a deep abyss.
2337480	2342480	Till it sets you out again.
