0	9220	Listen here y'all, listen real close, closer, come on don't be scared, snuggle on up with
9220	15340	your little wolfy boy, prepare to be comforted by the sounds of your favorite cuddle bug
15340	24740	wolf the dog, broadcasting live from 694.2 PTBP the radio station of your dreams baby.
24740	31660	This week's howlin with wolf comes from atj51ropa on twitter who tagged at pretending pod in
31660	37920	one of them their tweets, wow what a thoughtful act of support on a social media platform
37920	44580	that wolf definitely knows how to use without help, thanks my baby, they write, hey wolf
44580	50460	my dog, been missing your dulcet tones since I moved from contention to the city, it was
50460	56020	a real pleasant surprise to hear your pirate station up and running, can you give a shout
56020	61420	out to my lady still living in contention, I haven't heard from her in a couple days
61420	68980	so I think she must be mad at me, why else won't she return my calls, Bethany Ann Laberbarra
68980	75020	if you're listening, I love you, now that I think about it, no one from contention has
75020	83660	returned my calls, huh from JR pronounced JR not Jr from twitter slash the city, well
83660	89860	JR not Jr I once had me a little wolfy guy who would never return my calls, the only
89860	94220	thing that got her attention was when I threw a brick covered in crawdad grease through
94220	99420	her window in the dead of night, she finally started talking to me though it may have been
99420	105420	to scream at me that she was calling the police, so Bethany Ann return JR not Jr's
105420	111740	calls won't you, if you don't we'll have to assume something bad is going down in contention
111740	117540	that would prevent true love from blossoming, speaking of bad shit going down that prevents
117540	124440	any of us from finding true happiness, this is the news, last time our intrepid former
124440	130620	police officers entered the glass family compound and took a strange elevator meeting a nice
130620	137400	old lady and her spell performing friends on the way down to some kind of massive dank
137400	145240	aquatic interrogation chamber, on metal catwalks above murky green water they found Francis
145240	152680	beans interrogating Kathy Piston while lowering George Piston into the foul aquarium, unsurprisingly
152680	159680	a bit of a tussle ensued, also unsurprisingly Keith Vigna found his way into the water,
159680	164320	but as he was climbing up George Piston's body to escape from an unknown creature in
164320	170680	the depths that very beast swallowed the two of them and dove back into the hideous and
170680	180040	opaque pool below, oh no y'all that can't be good can it, oh well I have a note here

417440	421600	woof let's dive into it while we on that jovial note yeah
425120	430400	keith dived into it those murky black waters from which he'll never return
431520	439440	clark bishop john lee pettimore and francis beans are standing on a recently made wet catwalk
439440	451200	as the water begins to calm in front of them you guys see a couple bubbles rise to the top keith
451200	458240	keith silence prisoner don't speak about your captors in such a familiar tone
460480	468640	mr vigna that's that's better what is francis doing she is standing perfectly still staring
468640	475280	at the water along with you guys and then she looks over at you i guess let's just fucking
475280	480800	hang this guy up and we can torture him or you know interrogate him at like the same time yeah
480800	487120	sure all right why don't you get that hook ready and i'll get him ready okay so she jumps and grabs
487120	494320	on to the rope and swings across to the other side of the catwalk the chain yes sorry the chain
494800	502000	she grabs on to this wet mossy covered chain and swings across to the other side and then walks
502000	508080	toward you guys with the chain with the fish hook on the end of it and she begins walking toward
508080	515920	you what do you do i walk around the other side away from her stop being so squirrely prisoner
516720	522160	as she's approaching with the fish hook like she's stretching the chain out behind her right like
522640	528480	hauling it i want to try to like sneak attack her and just shove the hook right into her face
530800	535440	okay let's go ahead and i want to be like here let me let me see that pass it here and then i
535440	540240	just want to shove it straight up through her brain all right let's do a melee contest go
540240	549920	ahead and roll uh melee combat for me i have okay so we've got unarmed combat and melee weapons yes
550000	552240	all right this would be a melee weapon yeah okay gotcha
554160	561360	glad i didn't put any points in that yay ten yeah uh she rolled a 12.
562400	573680	fuck yeah oh damn it so as you move to grab this and basically attack her with it she gets the
573680	581440	jump on you and immediately turns it around and shoves it into your let's see what damage would
581440	589760	this be let's call it a d8 i mean can i try to dodge no you failed the competition against her
589760	599520	and she shoves it directly into your shoulder and the fish hook goes and you can feel it break into
599520	604960	the metal underneath your skin and then push through the metal that is just on the other
604960	610880	side of your skin as it goes into your shoulder what's that put your hit points at what did she
610880	618560	roll six damage uh that puts me at 13. all righty and as she does that it is clark bishop's turn can
618560	623760	i try and kick her and push her or shove her into the water that she's standing there absolutely
624000	625520	hold on i'd like to persuade her again
627600	632400	that'll be unarmed combat are we good no what are you doing what are you doing
632400	637600	are you fucking with me right now no no you're not yet not yet
641120	644080	so lick thought we called his name and so he came barging into the
645360	650720	wow it was your scream i met uh when you get the hook yeah it was
651040	655200	i didn't scream
658640	660560	you just screamed the thing that hurt you
665600	669920	it's a strange pronunciation but it got his attention i am unarmed combating
669920	673040	her to push her into the water absolutely go ahead and roll it
673200	680640	oh oh i did oh my god it's a crit success it's a 66 on a 70 okay i thought i could fail but i
680640	687600	got a 70 in that unarmed all right so i gave luke a check for avoiding going into the water
687600	691840	it was a dexterity check so i'm even though you crit succeeded i'm going to give her the same
691840	697520	role but i'm going to give her a negative 40 to her dexterity which actually puts her dexterity
697760	702160	which actually puts her dexterity at 30 so if she can roll
702160	706080	why even roll why don't you a success on a 30 then she can avoid
708240	714720	and i rolled a 44 thank fuck a crit fail fail so do you want to describe what happens as
714720	723520	francis beans shoves this small girl shoves this big fish hook this big like rusty fish hook into
724320	729600	more you come up and kick her off kick her center mass and just fling her into the water
729600	735680	but for the failiness of it i want you to tell me what happens yeah no as as you as you kick her
735680	743600	she is actually going to smack her head on the side of the catwalk as she falls in and her limp
743600	751680	body immediately just like belly flops onto the water kathy piston starts hollering she's like oh
751760	762400	fuck yeah baby that is what i like to see and the limp soon to be perhaps corpse of francis beans
762400	773040	lies floating on top of the dark green murky water below we're gonna cut to luke oh what
773520	775760	he's in a fish
780080	783040	you mean i'd like to see him get out of this conundrum
784160	788400	it's character creation that's all they're gonna do tonight it'd actually be amazing
789360	797760	so
800560	807120	yeah i think we decided that thomas either just yelled or mispronounced hook or yeah well i was
807120	812960	all the way in the kitchen talking to taylor i just heard a loud yell with a k sound at the
813040	815040	end so i was like oh i think they're calling me
817840	824000	well i just miss you guys exactly that makes sense it's time for you now okay well i can't
824000	833360	say that i'm excited about it but let's see where it goes it's extremely wet and dark and all you
833360	851120	hear is as all of this viscous membrane and water is pouring in and you also hear the cries
851120	859440	of george piston who is inside this creature with you first off i need you to roll sanity
859520	870480	16 on a nine you're gonna lose one sanity that puts me at my breaking point oh okay well then
870480	877680	let's get you a mania from the call of cthulhu seventh edition rule book okay i'll roll three
877680	883040	times three times on a d100 uh 67 all righty
885920	887360	21 all right
890000	903280	and 84 84 67 21 84 all righty 67 is mellow mania which is an obsession with music or a specific
903280	926400	tune okay 21 is kaka demon mania is a pathological belief that one is inhabited by an evil spirit
926400	933120	okay i like that one what's the last one 84 is 84 is plutomania which is the obsessive
933280	939040	desire for wealth i'm gonna go ahead and say the second one where i think what is it i'm possessed
939040	949840	by a demon cacodemomania cacodemomania yeah c-a-c-o-d-e-m-o mania okay and so you pronounce it
949840	956960	just as well as i could cacodemomania cacodemomania is a pathological belief that one is inhabited
956960	965360	by an evil spirit so now keith vigna oh i like this you have both had the empathy taken from
965360	971600	you correct and you also believe yourself to be inhabited by an evil spirit it's a very fun
971600	978880	combination that is good and you are inside of a giant creature with george piston who cries out
978880	986640	in the darkness you got my you got my leg you got you got my leg who is that who's who is am i
986720	990800	grabbing onto his leg i believe you were still holding on to it from when you were holding on
990800	999680	trying to climb up him i say nothing and i try to claw my way up george piston put my foot on his
999680	1006720	head and reach and try to get as close up to the mouth of this creature as i can absolutely so what
1006720	1015040	i'm gonna need you to do as you are pushing your back against this disgusting membrane you actually
1015040	1024800	feel the mucus and the the viscous sludge that is the inside of this creature perhaps burning what
1024800	1031520	is that feeling it's it's not quite burning it's it smells terrible in here and you feel pain and
1031520	1039520	you had no senses yeah so i'm gonna need you to roll constitution if i don't roll over this would
1039520	1047840	be real mad what do you have in constitution god damn it 70 i rolled at 89 all righty you are going
1047840	1057360	to take two damage okay not bad and you continue climbing up george piston starts screaming out and
1057360	1063600	he's just like no no it fucking burns i punch him in the face to shut him up it's completely
1063600	1071040	dark in here so go ahead and roll at a negative 40 you're unarmed i can't i can't roll that then
1071040	1077520	okay so you don't do that you're swinging wildly at what you think might be george piston your fists
1077520	1084880	are only getting more inside fish man creature okay uh i just continue crawling up as you begin
1084880	1094640	climbing up this massive disgusting creature is going to attempt to swallow harder in order to
1094640	1105040	digest you sooner okay as it moves and contracts its muscles it rolls a 19 and you begin moving
1105040	1112880	down from where you were and it is clear that the muscle muscly walls on either side of you are
1112880	1120960	pushing you further into this fish creature and you are exactly where you were last round go
1120960	1129760	ahead and roll a constitution check as more juices flow over your skin the face the face that luke
1129760	1138800	just made i roll a 90 well that sucks okay i'm getting even more new dice let's go ahead and
1138800	1146240	roll some damage here god damn it six i have been rolling like bullshit tonight six yeah you're
1146240	1152960	gonna take six more damage as these juices like literally start burning that puts me down to 17
1152960	1161200	and instead of crawling up i take out my very small very powerful pistol and fire off as many
1161200	1167200	shots as i can around you know like a not in the same spot but around the same spot to try to
1168000	1172240	put a hole in this creature all right go ahead and roll 2d 10 for damage for me
1173520	1182400	12 12 you begin shooting and you can feel the writhing and discomfort within this creature
1182400	1189360	that you are within as it begins to freak out and it's swimming all or like the movement is
1189360	1196880	uncanny compared to how smooth everything was before i mean your gun fires and you can feel
1196880	1203600	the pressure that you've blown into the inside of this fish but there's no water gushing in from the
1203600	1213280	side or anything yet and it decides to continue its plan of swallowing you further so it is going
1213280	1222480	to roll again am i doing con again or and then i need you to roll con thank you that is a 44
1222480	1230000	on a 70 oh all right you are still gonna take damage just a lower dice but with a crit success
1230560	1236640	you will take no damage from this mucus yeah and you are still in the same spot you're in
1236640	1245760	what i want to do is i want to pull out a frag grenade stick it in the hole that i've made with
1245760	1255120	my gun and then i want to push george up against that hole oh my god to protect myself oh that is
1255120	1266000	rough fish holy shit okay i'm gonna have you roll an athletics check in order to move george piston
1266000	1281120	into position it's 45 on a 50 45 on a 50 as hell yeah you do exactly what you described you pull
1281120	1286080	out a frag grenade you knew exactly where they were on your belt or inside i'm sorry inside your
1286080	1293200	massive in my in my trunks at this point these are doubling as swimming trunks and i've never seen
1293200	1298080	cargo shorts used as swimming trunks that's a lie i live in southwest missouri i've definitely
1298080	1308640	seen just technically swimming trunks now and you shove this frag grenade up into the hole that
1308640	1315040	you've made with your small but powerful gun and then you grab the underneath the arms of george
1315040	1321760	piston and move him directly over the position which he would usually i think he would win the
1321760	1329600	medal of honor for jesus christ had he not been put there by me taking one for the team uh
1332320	1339520	do you think that part of your action of doing this is caused by your new belief that there's
1339520	1345120	an evil spirit inside of you absolutely and then are you just giving yourself a pass because well
1345120	1350800	it's there's an evil spirit inside of me and i literally part of my brain that has empathy is
1350800	1358400	missing oh yep i said it earlier and i already forgot the uh combination of the two i am i'm
1358400	1363520	better than everybody i know and i don't give a fuck if you die for me to live all right well
1363520	1369760	let's go ahead and i'm gonna roll some damage here actually i'll have you roll the damage okay what
1369760	1375440	do you want me to roll i'm sure that there is a specific amount of damage taken from a frag
1375440	1381520	grenade but i'm gonna say that you're gonna roll 46 because you are putting him literally right
1381520	1390640	up against it that's six eleven eleven so you're gonna have that and you're gonna take half that
1390640	1399280	damage rounding up so you take six more damage okay however you have successfully blown a hole
1399280	1407440	in the side of this creature you immediately feel cold water rushing in whereas before you
1407440	1415680	were just surrounded by warm wet mucus and guts but now there's this cold murky water coming in
1415680	1422400	and you can kind of feel an opening that you can grip you know what i'm talking about yeah i want
1422480	1430320	to ace ventura out of this fish can you describe that in physical detail for me i've never seen
1430320	1439440	ace ventura the grenade explodes shrapnel pretty much blows george in half so that's the reason why
1439440	1445440	water's rushing in instead of him being stuck up next to it is his body's blown in half he may
1445440	1452240	still be alive for a minute but probably not i miss leo i stick my head with my hands
1452240	1459840	right up against my like forehead uh-huh and i start ripping this fish open and i'm just
1459840	1467520	wiggling my face out to where it's barely out and then i with all my strength push myself out
1468800	1474240	into the water out of this is this did did it's always sunny do the exact same joke as ace
1474240	1480560	ventura it was ace ventura putting his face out of a fake rhinos butthole oh okay i'll show it
1480560	1486240	to you after this i think frank uh danny divido comes out of a couch yeah very similar all right
1486240	1492480	well you are birthed out of this massive creature i pull a jonah except i think jonah was less
1492480	1499280	violent i i don't know ninova was a pretty dirty place all right let's uh let's get the rest of
1499280	1514400	the place into the room for this next part clark bishop john lee pettymore the two of you are
1514400	1522320	standing on this wet catwalk looking down at the body of francis beans underneath the surface of
1522320	1530080	the water deep down somewhere below you feel this massive quake and there's a rumbling of the entire
1530080	1536800	catwalk and it shakes you violently back and forth you hold your footing but you see this
1536800	1544880	burst of light from inside the murky water below and then you start to see bubbles coming up
1545600	1553440	onto the surface of this disgusting water and looking at the body of francis beans
1554320	1561040	you see right next to her the water break and popping up to the surface is keith vigna
1564000	1572640	keith keith fuck i'm just flapping around like trying to stay above water catching my breath

1715120	1723120	and i blew my way out of that fish oh no you did what keith you're the worst cop i don't know
1723120	1729680	if he had i hope he had a quick death but he was screaming as i as i squirmed my way out
1730560	1733840	she doesn't need to know that why did you think she should know that
1733840	1740000	there's something in me she's just crying there's something in me uh i want to i want to
1741600	1746320	okay i hit him i hit him with the bottom of my gun in the head oh my god do you let that
1746320	1752960	happen keith no i'm gonna roll against that yeah all right melee against dodge what are you doing
1752960	1759280	he's coming at you with the butt of his gun uh look at me what do you do athletics no no not
1759280	1762720	what role you do what do you do to get out of the way of his gun he's coming at you with the
1762720	1768880	butt of his gun i roll over you roll over yeah so that's a dodge so okay you're gonna roll against
1768880	1778720	his melee weapons i have a 56 on a 30 i also failed 64 on a 40 john lee petty more 30 you
1778720	1785920	kind of like sideswipe his face but he's like literally covered in this disgusting mucusy
1785920	1791920	goo that hasn't quite rinsed off completely and the butt of your gun just kind of slides right
1791920	1796000	off the side of his head okay so i turn it around and i point it at his face and i say what the fuck
1796000	1804320	do you mean there's something in you something i saw something in there i don't know if i'm
1804320	1811840	gonna try to control it but there's something evil inside me can i look into keith's eyes
1812560	1817200	do i see any difference is there a little man in there i see a little boy
1818960	1824000	evil man strapping luke what does he see in your eyes they look past you when you look into him
1824880	1831600	i look over keith's head at kevin john and um i do just kind of like a look
1831600	1834880	oh you pull your collar
1837920	1846000	while they do that i i slide myself up into a standing position left and i look down at
1846000	1851920	francis and i'm like well looks like you guys got her taken care of should we head on well i mean
1852960	1858800	she's sort of taken care of i don't know if she she's maybe not she's just knocked out down there
1859040	1864960	she'll be she will be taken care of floating face down well i she's currently just floating down
1864960	1869360	so she's she probably died a couple minutes ago i'm saying if we want to fish her out and talk
1869360	1875120	to her that would be the time well how long since she's been in the water like a minute yeah now
1875120	1881600	would be the time for sure if it's not too late but we can try to do we want do we want to do we
1881600	1888880	want to keith you have experience in this water get her out i look at i look i'm like we can try
1888880	1893360	to hook her out of there but oh she deserves that and i i like patting my shoulder is it which you
1893360	1898080	notice is all fucked up from huh is it out of you i've just realized i don't know if we know there's
1898080	1904240	a when you patted your shoulder there's still a giant rusty fish hook inside of it you may have
1904240	1908800	noticed this giant rusty fish yeah you just you just have a lot of slack so you're able to keep
1908800	1915120	doing stuff i think we if i think at this point if we want to i don't know if we can talk to her
1915120	1919440	but she might have something on her we want to get out but otherwise i think we just continue on and
1919440	1924080	it's your niece keith i mean well my niece put me in this position i wouldn't have died if it
1924080	1929760	hadn't been for her so i could give a fuck about her is that well she offered me the terrible
1929760	1935280	decision that i had made that you made yeah of course she presented you with the choice that you
1935280	1942720	chose it's all her fault it is had it not been for her i wouldn't be in the position i am i
1942720	1948880	i didn't never died i don't think that's one way to look at it certainly i'm either way on this we
1948880	1954480	can keep going or if you want to fish her out she might have something on her but a minute face down
1954480	1959360	and water doesn't sound too promising yeah maybe we should go through her pockets that bitch
1959360	1967600	deserves anything that you fucking deem necessary now will you fucking let me down please well wait
1967600	1972960	hold up hold on a minute i need to ask you something what what are you i'm john lee
1972960	1978640	pettymore don't you recognize me and i shoot her a wink her eyes go wide and she's like no
1978640	1983440	you're definitely not bubble gum tree and i thought you don't know what that means so
1983440	1990240	i walk up behind kevin john and i look at kathy kathy's uh he's telling you the truth
1990240	1996160	that's that's john i've kind of snapped out of it real quick and i look over and i'm like i know
1996160	2001360	you don't want to talk to me after what i said but i can attest to it as well yeah we're we're
2001360	2008160	better people for you generally then than she were but i don't actually want to get you off
2008160	2014800	them chains until you ask that last question she had what did the circle of knowledge use
2014800	2022320	them homeless people for her face wrinkles up and she's like no way no way that all you all are all
2022320	2027760	connected in all sorts of this terrible nonsense we're trying to we're trying to peel back the
2027760	2035600	terrible nonsense you saw we're not on francis's side i walk past kevin toward kathy and i turn and
2035600	2043280	look back at kevin i uh i actually know what they were using the people for and i look at kathy
2043280	2050080	i said kathy i i'm working with maggie now how does she react she just lost her husband
2050720	2059440	and she is hanging grotesquely from mid forearms she is in just an insane amount of pain and
2059440	2071120	emotional torment so that while coming to her as a surprise does not necessarily garner a massive
2071120	2079840	reaction okay so i guess everyone in this whole fucking world is under some weird sort of unnatural
2079840	2085440	bullshit but if you if you if you're working for her then you fucking tell them well i'm telling
2085440	2090720	you but we're we're on your side now yeah we're trying to stop that weird supernatural bullshit
2091600	2096560	is that what you want well then fucking let me down this hurts i go ahead and do that i go ahead
2096560	2100640	and try and help her down i don't know how to do that can i do joe doesn't know how to do that
2100640	2105600	because i'm not standing there but would i be able to pull her in some way do you have uh any sort of
2105600	2111040	like mechanical engineering or she's a little bit too far away from me you'd have to like jump out
2111040	2118000	to her i mean looking over there is a lever that you saw francis using to lower george piston in
2118000	2123120	i look over at her and i tell her start swinging our way we'll grab you i've got a really high
2123120	2128320	survival skill would that help me in some way i don't think that's necessarily what that is meant
2128320	2134640	for but whoever has the highest intelligence could roll intelligence to to figure this one out i'd say
2134640	2146320	that's not me it's me oh no i have a 75 i crit failed 77 okay you are absolutely positive that
2146320	2152080	you know what you're doing kathy i think you live there now i've got this no i've got this i can get
2152080	2158880	it out definitely without severing any major arteries or hurting you in any way as we get you
2158880	2167280	off this chain assembly and you go over and do what you will to the mechanism that is holding
2167280	2173760	her up and as soon as you start fiddling with it she drops fully into the water the chain releases
2173760	2179920	and it moves all the way down and it continues to lower and lower and lower and now the top of the
2179920	2186480	chain or the bottom that you can see of the chain right up against the water is dry and has no algae
2186480	2193200	or rust on it so you know that this is in fully engaged all the way down position oh well okay
2193200	2198640	easy enough i do the opposite of what i just did and reverse that with that crit fail you lock it
2198640	2207920	into position oh damn it i'm sorry kathy can i go over and like kick the lever kathy piston is
2207920	2212240	drowning currently i want to try and kick it back the other direction but i don't know if you'll
2212240	2217520	allow that with a crit failure no i certainly won't okay no so you can kick it yeah yeah
2217520	2222400	you can set you can definitely kick it it breaks off it breaks off completely yeah there you go
2222400	2230000	and uh and there is no lever anymore god damn it i start fiddling with the other lever trying to
2230000	2235600	swing the hook into uh francis to try to pull her up and see if we can't search her george
2235600	2240960	pistons hook yeah you're trying to hook francis beans with george pistons hook is it's it's not
2240960	2245360	is it still stuck in the fish no no it was hanging yeah it's hanging yeah is she on that
2245360	2249440	side thomas what do you got i'm gonna dive into the water and try to save kathy piston there you
2249440	2256720	go so keith goes over and is fiddling with the other lever and john lee pettymore is diving in
2257520	2264560	john oh shit that was stupid well keithy you blew you blew up the fish thing right i mean he's he's
2264560	2270320	gonna be okay right there's no fish thing right i don't know how many is in here this is a look
2270320	2276640	how big this tank is oh fuck jaw get out of there i'm swimming straight down all right on the chain
2277200	2281360	uh luke and joe i'm gonna need you guys to leave the room oh shit
2292080	2299200	john lee pettymore you dive into this dark green murky water and it is pretty cold
2299200	2305680	on your skin as you begin swimming down directly following the chain yeah
2306880	2313040	so this is an interesting that's what the chain wants me to do you never break the chain so when
2313040	2320880	you are going down there i'm imagining that your mind is just filling up with all of these thoughts
2320880	2327120	about what was just said above the water how many of these creatures actually exist
2327600	2337840	in this aquarium power is a stat in this game that is for mental fortitude what is your power
2338720	2346720	60 i'm gonna have you roll a power check and if you succeed you can continue without taking
2346720	2348240	a sanity check okay
2350800	2360960	30 you push all of those thoughts those intrusive thoughts out of your mind as you begin to go hand
2360960	2369920	over hand down this chain into the darkness of this water go ahead and roll an athletics check
2369920	2383120	for me 93 on a 50 93 on a 50 as you go hand over hand you you keep slipping on all this algae that
2383120	2389120	is all over this chain but you continue making your way down and you think you hear something
2390320	2395680	your ears are completely filled up with water but something i think i hear something it's perfect
2395680	2403040	god you're right here with me inside of your mind and as you're going down i need you to roll
2403040	2413920	luck for me oh no what's your luck at my luck is at 20. oh six holy shit
2417840	2423280	fuck yes all right so i was giving you one athletics check to get down there
2424160	2431840	okay yeah so you can now make your way all the way down to where kathy is get the hook
2431840	2438080	out of her arms and follow the chain back up to the surface don't say i never did anything for
2438080	2444400	you kathy all right i'm gonna get the other boys okay
2453280	2458240	clark bishop you're looking down into the dark water where john lee pettymore just dove in
2459120	2466160	keith you're messing with this hook over over there go ahead and roll a dexterity check for
2466160	2476480	me to see if you can uh wrap or yeah dexterity for me yes sir 15 on a 60 nice much like a
2476480	2484480	nice much like a well-versed child in an arcade you know exactly how to hook onto the body of
2484480	2491280	francis beans and you can drag her over to where you can and then i dump it onto the catwalk the
2491280	2498960	body the body the body the body you dump the body onto the the catwalk and do you do anything or you
2498960	2504720	just look at it oh uh well i want to go search uh her like pockets and stuff to see if she has like
2505520	2511440	keys or any anything that we can use to continue our path into the glass compound while he's
2511440	2517360	searching can i see if i get a pulse yeah absolutely roll first aid for me clark as he's
2517360	2525200	doing that keith you're going through the pockets and really all you find is a uh a stun gun and a
2525200	2532240	card that is a dirty dog grooming key fob okay i failed my first aid roll a 68 on a 30 yeah she's
2532240	2540480	she's alive and well uh i will take the oh she's alive what that was my fail was that i found i
2540480	2545600	can tell that she's alive yeah you feel a pulse oh well i'll take the stun gun and does the card
2545600	2552160	have her name on it or is it just a yes yeah it's for it's a key fob for uh the loyalty program
2552160	2559200	at dirty dog grooming to francis beans well i'll pocket that and then uh i'll take the taser
2559200	2563120	is there any way to check and see if that works is there like a light that lights up or anything on
2563120	2568800	it sure yeah the light lights up it does the crackly noise yeah when you click on yeah it's
2568800	2575680	got two little uh metal tips at the end and a little uh static goes in between the two points
2575680	2583600	i'll stick that into my pockets and then uh is she alive yeah i got a pulse oh shit do you know cpr
2583600	2589360	i do uh first aid on her to to do cpr okay roll that first aid clark would probably know how to
2589360	2597360	do cpr too but i got a pretty high it's a nine on a 60 yeah keith vigna actually passed that exam
2597360	2605440	more recently than you did yeah so keith as you begin doing cpr you realize that you have broken
2605440	2612080	the sternum of the corpse of your niece francis beans because she wasn't actually alive no not
2612080	2619920	even remotely keep going keith keep going you're you're doing good i swear i got a pulse i uh i
2619920	2624560	kick her body back into the the water whoa whoa oh i do it i did it
2627440	2635840	and i as as you do that um breaking the water john lee pettymore as you rise up you get hit
2635840	2647040	in the head i kicked her into the other side he did not dive in now he's got total corpse
2651920	2658480	and you guys help john lee pettymore holding cathy piston get onto the catwalk that you
2658480	2663200	guys have all been on for some time now but he's gag reflexing all over keith yeah well
2666400	2673040	they climb onto francis's floating dead body to uh hoist themselves up so that we can grab them
2674960	2680560	and then he throws up all over me you got her you got her him and i all it took was a little
2680560	2690320	bit of luck and i turned and winked to the camera uh is cathy looking alive and is she conscious
2690320	2694400	nope she is unconscious i know cpr
2698560	2703280	i just rolled to do it yeah you're in a pretty good mental state and you just succeeded
2703280	2710480	so let's have that roll roll on over to cathy piston so i do a very good nine out of whatever
2710560	2718640	i said 60 staying alive staying alive and i think it's staying alive
2722320	2723360	yeah clark knows first
2729440	2735440	nice and so cathy piston becomes spitting up this dirty water right into my mouth
2735440	2741360	right into keith's mouth that's usually what happens when you're rinsing away some of the
2741920	2749360	vomit that john lee pettymore just put there and she starts screaming she's like you you you
2752800	2757840	killed me you saved me thank you well we was only trying to save you but we accidentally
2758480	2765360	dropped you in that water i'm gonna need a second to recover one mississippi all right let's go
2765440	2772320	so keith why didn't why didn't you just do that with francis too because i think that you might
2772320	2779920	have uh felt your own pulse on her neck instead of hers i don't think that she was actually alive
2779920	2784960	when we fished her out of there i'm sorry oh i'm not actually sorry though she's a bitch so clark
2784960	2789760	grabbed her wrist with one hand and touched his neck with his other hand no no no he just felt
2790880	2794560	the heat of the moment man he's like you know what he didn't do it correctly and he felt the
2794560	2804160	pulse of his own finger and not her pulse which is uh no i i did the neck thing which you can still
2804160	2809760	feel your own finger pulse on so i think you might have just fucked it up but uh yeah i uh
2809760	2814640	tried to resuscitate a dead woman i tried my best though but then you resuscitated a live woman yeah
2814640	2821360	and it worked so made up for it so clark you might once we once we're done with this you might need
2821360	2826560	to take another first aid class but i think that's the least of our concerns today on that cpr that's
2826560	2832880	for sure i'm glad you're here though and i look at everybody i'm like i think i'm ready to uh
2832880	2838720	go see what's down there i want to go fuck marvin up yeah i think we should go and get us one more
2838720	2846560	recruit before we go though who do we got uh our boy back there man i i pissed him off around but
2846560	2851280	yeah but joe gave him a wink so also we can just leave you here and if we show up with kathy if
2851280	2860320	it's me and joe and kathy walking down there i mean i say hey who's joe i'm sorry the water really
2860320	2867280	addled my brains i was under for quite a while if me and uh clark and kathy walk on down there
2867280	2873200	and he sees that you know i'm i'm with the two alleged prisoners maybe you just hang back a
2873200	2878160	little you can i'll walk down a little bit with you but i'll hold back so i'll be i'll be close
2878160	2883840	enough that i can help it's crouched down i'll be outside of his view yeah crawl up well because
2883840	2888240	he's probably looking one way i'll just be right behind him where he can't see me that's such a
2888240	2892960	good idea that everybody should just do that and as you do that behind the person they're trying
2892960	2901360	not to be seen by it's very stealthy it's the only way clark looks down at kathy kathy are you uh

2987760	2994400	i just forgot about one of my biggest clients back to that he's a business partner well yeah
2994400	3000320	i supply him with you know people yeah let's talk about that how you use a people supplier well we
3000320	3005600	don't really need to hop on into all that as soon as i lose my husband and have my whole world turned
3005600	3012320	upside down john we just need you to help us out right now should i have saved your life or is you
3012400	3018080	just a miserable sack of human trading shit look those people were compensated very fairly they
3018080	3023520	got a place to stay and they got you know they got food to eat and what'd you do to them no in
3023520	3029760	return i just borrowed them you know out to different people right so like you know i guess
3029760	3034240	clark you know maggie they're at the circle of knowledge she's been using them and i know how
3034240	3038160	mag has been using them do you know how marvin's been using them i didn't know marvin was using
3038160	3043280	well yeah marvin you know he's a little bit darker you know than uh than jim was for sure
3043280	3048960	but you know he certainly i don't know you know he he uses them for fights which isn't great you
3048960	3053360	know obviously but we he normally breeds them first and then you know they're not born into
3053360	3060160	a world where they're really known to any sort of comfort so i guess it makes it slightly better but
3060160	3065920	mostly i'm just getting that sweet sweet money and i you know i've been using all those people
3065920	3071440	down there uh you know uh getting getting my clicks from my business you are an awful sack
3071440	3078240	of human shit and everything wrong with capitalism in this world but uh what do you mean using them
3078240	3083520	different than jim jim cook yeah jim cook yeah he used to run he used to run the circle of knowledge
3083520	3088880	obviously and but what yeah but why did you compare him to marvin well just because i've
3088880	3093520	been working with jim for years and i've been working with marvin for years and uh you know
3093520	3098400	i always felt fine handing people over to they'd always come back and they'd you know keep staying
3098400	3103200	with me for a while but i was confused i thought marvin had inherited some kind of thing from jim
3103200	3109520	but i was i was simply confused that was the way i said it was confusing i well i do this does
3109520	3117440	bring me back to another point uh before i i dived into that water don't call me a hero but
3117440	3127840	but but clark what the hell what what is the circle of knowledge using these homeless folk
3127840	3134720	folk yeah about that um human experimentation no you know remember that thing i told you i
3134720	3140400	saw in that vision that big thing that scared the day of living daylights out of me well to
3140400	3148880	keep it contained wherever the plan of existence it's in they need people in that plan at all times
3148880	3155760	chanting to keep it there so they have a kind of continuous rotation of homeless people who
3157040	3162080	kind of sort of volunteer for it like they they they they're glad to be keeping that thing they're
3162080	3166640	well compensated all right well that's better that's better than death masses you are not off
3166640	3174240	the hook kathy i am now clearly thank you for getting me off the hook all right hey kathy good

3347920	3351120	and kathy looks at you and she's like what do you want to talk about
3351120	3359680	uh i i just wanted to pick your brain for a second here um do you trust maggie maggie
3359680	3365680	yeah you've been providing bodies it sounds like to her and jim for a while now i just
3365680	3369760	wonder what your thoughts on her are right now oh she's certainly a little bit more rough around the
3369760	3376080	edges than her old man was that's for sure she's been fine to deal with on my end but you know she
3376160	3383040	does have that fire in her eye in the last i don't know a couple years how long you've been
3383040	3390000	how long you've been providing bodies to them homeless folks to them gosh 20 years is there
3390000	3395600	any chance in the last year or two um they were coming back any different if the homeless people
3395600	3400320	ever spoken to you about changes or things that have been different about their time there at the
3400320	3406560	circle or now in the past what since the changeover happened you know about the changeover well i
3406560	3412080	mean clearly maggie's in charge now and because her old man died right jim died yeah yeah i was
3412080	3417120	i was wondering if there's been a change strangled in an alleyway in the city can you imagine god
3418400	3423040	anyway uh yeah no he was a he was a fine man to deal with seemed like he had his head on his
3423040	3428160	shoulders straight you know maybe a little bit of an alcohol problem but past that man who doesn't
3428160	3436160	have a vice but come to think of it i i haven't seen any of the the people i've dropped off with
3436160	3442720	her uh in the past uh week you know i typically you know she they'd normally keep them for a while
3442720	3447840	so i haven't gotten any back from her i will say i used to get them back from jim you know we'd
3447840	3452320	have a pretty daily rotation going in and out so it's unusual the amount of time it's been since
3452320	3457360	you've seen your stock i suppose so but i've been in the hospital with george past couple days you
3457360	3465440	know about a week now you know and uh we got dragged out there by these thugs so to clarify
3465440	3469840	you're you're like an independent contractor are you you're not part of the circle are you no
3470480	3476960	gotcha the circle no no god no i'm not part of any of that nonsense i'm just in it for the money
3476960	3484400	baby baby i'm just in it for the money baby all right all right kathy thanks thanks for talking
3484400	3491520	to me now he said leo disappeared what's that he disappeared like you don't know where he is or
3491520	3496560	he said he saw him disappear and then he said disappear which i have no idea what the fuck that
3496560	3502400	means well you you said it yourself people have been disappearing all over contention yeah but
3502400	3509520	i didn't think actually disappearing like not existing anymore well we're not exactly sure
3509520	3516640	that's exactly the case but that's what it looks like right now you saw my brother-in-law leo
3516640	3525600	piston he was there in front of you and then all of a sudden he was not yeah kathy uh john wasn't
3525600	3534240	lying he he was he was dead before he disappeared how do you remember uh that incident with the the
3534240	3542320	maxwell girl oh yeah she she finally got her revenge julie or ashley julie i was gonna say
3542320	3547440	if ashley got her revenge that would i mean you know not counting anything out of sorts these days
3547440	3555200	with everything that's going on but julie julie killed leo julie killed leo but kathy i'm here to
3555200	3563600	tell you i i killed julie some some modicum of justice was dealt she just throws her arms around
3563600	3570560	you and starts sobbing into your shoulder i uh clark doesn't know how to react to that very well
3570560	3576160	and i don't think he fully embraces her it's just kind of an awkward pat on the back what is a god
3576160	3578880	due to a crying woman oh fuck yeah
3581360	3582800	i have no idea

3619280	3625600	and if we don't utilize it in its entirety it's a wasted opportunity and this podcast is
3625600	3632240	illegitimate bullshit i've actually listened to every episode uh about five times and there's
