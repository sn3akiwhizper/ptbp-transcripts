0	5500	Salutations and greetings, friendos of all shapes and sizes.
5500	10500	It's your geometry, Professor Wolf the dog, hittin' you up from the past.
10500	14500	And I am here celebrating every hexagon I see,
14500	18500	because that's just how Professor Wolfie likes to roll.
18500	25500	And I'm rollin' in filth, live from the past, from 694.2 PTBP.
26000	30000	Now we bout to roll on over to a new howlin' with Wolf.
30000	33000	This week's howlin' with Wolf is simple.
33000	36000	Name, Ahmed Adudi.
36000	41000	Message, I have nipples, fucker. Could you milk me?
41000	44500	Listen here, Ahmed Adudi.
44500	47000	I don't know what you're tryin' to pull,
47000	50500	but you better be happy I'm trapped here in the past,
50500	55000	because I don't milk no one, lest we got prior arrangements made.
55500	58500	I take the art of milkin' quite seriously,
58500	62500	and it sounds like you're tryin' to play me for a fool.
62500	65500	Last time I milked a stranger on the internet,
65500	68500	I ended up with two gallons of sour milk.
68500	71500	And let me tell y'all, this wasn't no buttermilk.
71500	75500	I tried to make me a big ol' stack of pancakes out of that shit,
75500	78500	and it damn near burnt my esophagus.

115500	118500	With all of the pros and none of the cons,
118500	125500	it's Blue False Indigo with Boooooooon Daaaaaaams.
125500	131500	She runs
131500	133000	oooh
137000	143000	The sun
143000	146000	is sleeping soon
148500	154000	She knows
154000	158000	that the time has come
158500	162500	to dance beneath the
162500	168500	dance beneath the shadow of the moon
174500	180500	Luke, you said that it has felt like ages in the mind of Ash Hornbeam
180500	187000	since this human face, this head, went back down beneath the bush out of sight,
187000	189500	and you're just sitting there. What do you do?
189500	192500	I get up and I go over to the bush with axe in hand.
192500	195500	As you approach the bush, you hear like a
199500	203500	I turn heel and I run back to camp as soon as I hear that.
203500	204000	Okay.
204000	207500	Cuz I don't have any intent of using, I didn't wanna use this axe,
207500	209500	it was just kind of like an intimidation thing.
209500	210000	Sure.
210000	213500	But whatever I just saw and whatever I just heard, yeah.
214000	218000	I think this is a job for more than one boy, because
218000	222000	you know, I've seen horror movies and when you go off by yourself and try to do something,
222000	224000	it doesn't usually end up well.
224000	228000	So, I mean, I know nothing's gonna end up well, but I don't want it to be this soon.
228000	231000	So I run back to camp where
231000	233000	To meet up with Jeremy Pettymore.
233000	236000	Jeremy Pettymore.
236000	237500	Jeremy Pettymore.
237500	239000	Jerahim Pettymore.
239000	240000	Yeah, that is correct.
240000	240500	Okay.
243500	262000	Jeremy Pettymore, you're standing at your campsite and you've been looking around for anything out of the ordinary
262000	267000	as there was no wood at this campsite, which caught you off guard as you had called earlier
267000	271000	to make an arrangement to make sure there was wood at the campsite,
271500	278000	which you mentioned was a very dutiful thing for a 14-year-old boy to have done, especially Jeremy Pettymore.
278000	282000	Yeah, and not necessarily for a 14-year-old boy, but definitely for Jeremy Pettymore.
282000	282500	Absolutely.
282500	284500	This is the only thing.
284500	287500	He doesn't, like, talk to adults on the phone.
287500	290000	That makes a whole lot of sense.
290000	293500	And as you're walking around, you don't notice anything out of the ordinary,
293500	299500	you don't notice anything interesting, however, sprinting back into the campsite.
300000	312000	Jeremy, Ash comes in, who typically has a level head, tends to keep cool, but you can tell that I am perturbed.
312000	313000	What's going on, man?
313000	319000	As far as I could discern, there's literally nothing of interest in this entire vicinity.
319000	325000	And you see me, like, two hand-wielding an axe with white knuckles, and I'm like,
325000	334500	There's a man in a bush by that log, and he doesn't sound, he sounds like he's making animal noises.
334500	339500	I went over to the bush, but I was too spooked, and...
339500	341500	Do you want to come check it out with me?
341500	342500	Yeah, absolutely.
342500	345500	You should grab one of the machetes or axes just in case.
345500	347500	I've got this gun!
347500	349500	That is true!
349500	355000	And Ash is like, okay, and I lead the way back to the bush.
355000	362500	As you get back to the bush, you notice the exact same bush is still rustling with movement, and you hear a
367500	371500	I want to pick up a stick that is on the ground, and I want to just poke at the bush.
371500	373000	Oh man, there's so many sticks on the ground.
373000	376500	Yeah, I want to pick up the longest one I can find and poke the bush with it.
376500	379000	You gotta roll to make sure you don't pick up a short one.
380500	382500	Uh, it's 93 feet long.
384500	394000	You find the longest stick in the forest, and you poke at this bush from a distance, clearly, and you hear a
395500	406000	And stepping back away from the bush is a naked human man who has scratches all over his body, and some are deeper than scratches.
406000	416000	They seem almost like cuts, and he's bleeding, and he looks at you with these huge eyes, and he just freezes and stares at you.
416000	420500	Thinking back to those Polaroids, the Polaroid of the Polaroids.
420500	422000	Yeah, I bring that up.
422000	425000	Do we recognize this man as any of the missing people?
425000	429000	I can barely make out anybody in this picture, but I don't know.
429000	431000	When you squint, does he look like the top man?
431000	436000	Yeah, we start squinting and squinting at the picture and looking up at the naked man, and then back.
436000	439000	What would be a check that you could use to discern?
439000	442500	I mean, as long as we don't have facial aphasia, I think that's uh...
442500	444000	Do you have facial aphasia?
444000	444500	No.
444500	445500	Okay, then you can tell that it...
445500	447000	I don't have that written down.
448000	452500	Then you can tell that it is one of the people who has gone missing.
452500	453500	Ash, it's that one!
453500	454500	Did we learn his name?
454500	461500	No, you did not, and it is much harder to read the names on this Polaroid than to see faces.
461500	462500	Hey, hey guy?
464000	466500	Wait, what time is it right now? Is it dark out?
466500	468500	No, the sun is going down currently.
468500	472500	Guy, it gets cold out here after the sun goes down this time of year.
472500	474500	We got a... You wanna put some pants on?
474500	477500	We got a first aid kit if you need it, or a machete.
477500	480500	He kind of walks up toward you pretty quickly.
480500	482500	Ooh, I point the gun at him.
482500	489500	You point the gun at him, and that does not change his movement as his hands come together.
489500	497500	And he's using his fingers, pushing his fingertips together, and he looks at you and his eyes get really big.
497500	503500	And then he kind of like, droops down his eyes to make a sad, solemn face.
503500	504500	Like a puppy dog face.
504500	505500	Like a puppy dog eyes.
508500	509500	I look at Ash.
509500	513500	You should follow us back to the shack.
513500	516500	Ash, what the hell, man? We don't want to take this thing anywhere.
516500	519500	Well, it doesn't seem like he's going to hurt us, and honestly...
519500	527500	He's a naked dog, man. I want to get him away from our campsite, but he's in that missing persons thing.
527500	528500	We ought to bring him back to the old man.
528500	529500	He sniffs the air.
529500	531500	Oh right, our civic duty.
531500	538500	And he looks back, and he looks behind you, and he smells the air, and he's going to start running for where your campsite is.
538500	539500	Should I follow suit?
539500	541500	Or should we try to red rover him?
541500	542500	Are we in front of him, or...?
542500	543500	You're in front of him. You're in between.
543500	544500	Yeah.
544500	545500	Let's try to stop him.
545500	548500	We make eye contact and just grab each other's arms and try to like, clothesline him.
548500	551500	Red rover, red rover, send freak boy right over.
551500	557500	Go ahead and roll sanity for me, both of you, because this is not a normal situation.
557500	560500	Coming across a man in this state in the woods.
560500	561500	I fail.
561500	562500	I pass.
562500	565500	Okay, Luke, Ash Hornbeam is going to lose one sanity.
565500	567500	Jeremy Pettymore will lose none.
567500	568500	This is kind of fun.
568500	573500	He's been around his criminal uncles long enough to see what a naked cut-up man looks like.
573500	575500	Yeah, I've seen plenty of this.
575500	578500	Like, you get into the shine a little too much.
578500	586500	So as you guys reach out to each other to red rover, Ash freaks out and backs away and is going to let this guy go right through.
586500	589500	Yeah, I trip over the log that's located right next to me.
589500	590500	It's perfect.
590500	598500	And I need Jeremy Pettymore to, if you're going to attempt to grab him alone, roll an unarmed combat for me.
601500	603500	Ooh, fail, 67 on a 50.
603500	608500	And the man makes it right past through you and takes off running.
608500	613500	And as he's running, I want you both to roll a humant for me.
617500	619500	Ooh, pass, 27 on a 40.
619500	620500	41 on a 50.
620500	630500	Alright, so you would both realize as he's running away from you, Ash you see from the ground on your butt after falling from tripping over this log.
630500	640500	And Jeremy, you see as he brushes past you and continues to sprint in his own way, this is not the sprint of a normal human man.
640500	641500	Like, way too fast.
641500	645500	Not only is it very fast, but he's also crouched.
645500	658500	And as he comes across like any brush on the ground, he's using his front legs, I mean arms, to help him in his transport.
658500	661500	So he's running on all fours essentially.
661500	666500	And he is making his way directly to your campsite.
666500	671500	Have you seen that video of that horse girl who runs like a horse and jumps over stuff?
671500	673500	Fuck, that shit is, I hate that.
673500	675500	That's exactly what I'm imagining.
675500	676500	It's really unnerving.
676500	680500	And it's also terrifying, and people went to high school with that person.
680500	682500	Actually, probably not, she was probably homeschooled.
682500	685500	That's it, that's a little bit of a relief.
685500	686500	One can only hope.
686500	692500	I get off my butt and I start regularly running back to the campsite.
692500	699500	Yeah, Jeremy Fettymore has certainly never seen anybody whose mind has been switched with that of a common house animal.
699500	701500	No, Jeremy doesn't anymore.
701500	703500	He doesn't know what the fuck is going on.
703500	706500	He runs after it too.
706500	711500	And he's kind of trembling with the pistol in his hand, but he's like, mister, I'll shoot.
711500	712500	I'll do it.
712500	719500	Yeah, and I'm still firmly holding onto that axe, but when I start sprinting, I'm one hand in it.
719500	728500	I'm holding it like when a server, such as myself, holds a steak knife up against your arm, blade away, so that it doesn't cut me if I fall.
728500	732500	Yeah, ironically, that's actually the worst way to hold an axe.
732500	735500	They call that the lumberjack's demise.
735500	737500	Well, I have never been a lumberjack.
737500	739500	Ash has never been a lumberjack.
739500	741500	He thinks that's the best way to do it, so that's how I do it.
741500	750500	When you arrive at the campsite, you see that this man is hunched over, he is ripped apart, whichever bag had food in it that you guys brought,
750500	755500	and he is just going to town on any snacks that you may have brought, and he checks mixes.
755500	757500	My little smokies!
762500	769500	Ash, without thinking, drops the axe, takes a running jump, and just both feet into this guy's head, kicks him off the food.
769500	771500	Oh shit, Ash! Kicked him in the face!
771500	776500	Roll an unarmed combat, and I'll give you a plus 20.
777500	778500	Fuck.
779500	782500	78 on what would be, with a plus 20, 70.
782500	794500	He ducks right out of the way, he rolled an aught 7, and he continues to feast as you slide on your back, and you get covered in mud.
794500	802500	Like, absolutely covered your eye. Actually, go ahead and roll a dexterity for me to make sure you don't stab yourself with that lumberjack's demise.
802500	805500	I already, I said I dropped it before I did the flying kick.
805500	807500	Well, that's extremely smart of you.
808500	810500	It's also good real playing to listen to your players.
810500	811500	Yeah, it is.
811500	816500	As I slide in the mud, I hear Jeremy Pettymore go,
816500	817500	You're out!
820500	822500	I didn't hear it either, so for all we know, he's just lying.
822500	824500	Yeah, if so, he's a beast.
824500	825500	It was a grave.
825500	827500	You can pause it and play it back if you want.
827500	829500	No, I appreciate the bluff.
829500	831500	And I trust Ash Hornbeam.
831500	834500	Yeah, he's inherently really cool.
835500	839500	Right, so Jeremy Pettymore calls you out, and then does what?
839500	845500	Jeremy is going to look at his skill sheet that he hasn't seen in a couple weeks.
846500	853500	Disguise. Jeremy Pettymore is going to charge the naked man.
853500	857500	And how is the dude situated after his tussle with Luke?
857500	861500	Oh, still crouched. He just crouched a little bit lower to get out of the way there.
861500	863500	So he's maybe belly on the ground.
863500	866500	Prone eating little smokies and Chex mix.
866500	870500	He's got little weenies in his mouth and little Chexes on the ground.
870500	873500	I'm going to just try to throw him off our food.
873500	875500	Yeah, let's go ahead and roll that unarmed.
875500	878500	I'll still give you a plus 20 because he is busy.
878500	879500	Critical success.
879500	880500	Oh, shit.
880500	886500	Well, then describe exactly what you would like to do with this giant, bloody, cut-up man.
886500	887500	Naked.
887500	888500	He's naked.
888500	892500	Jeremy Pettymore is like, give me those.
892500	895500	And with one hand, he snatches the can of little smokies,
895500	900500	and with the other, he just pushes the dude on the forehead straight off away from our backpack of food.
901500	909500	So he backs up, and he gets on his haunches, and he's holding his hands up in front of him like a prairie dog,
909500	912500	and he looks at you, and he's just hissing.
912500	914500	I want to throw the can at him.
914500	917500	You're going to waste your smokies?
917500	918500	Brother, I've got more.
918500	920500	That'll be athletics.
923500	925500	Fail. 40 out of 30.
925500	926500	You sail.
926500	927500	Sail!
927500	929500	The little smokies.
929500	930500	Sail.
930500	931500	Sail.
931500	932500	Which is what I meant to do.
932500	935500	I just wanted to throw a warning shot across his bow, his proverbial bow.
935500	940500	Well, it actually seems to help because he immediately runs away toward them.
940500	946500	He runs behind where he was, further away from you, and goes and grabs the can of little smokies
946500	950500	and is attempting to open it, but cannot quite figure out how to do it.
950500	954500	Did that ranger mention any way we could contact him out here?
955500	956500	Shoot a gunshot.
956500	957500	Oh, come on.
958500	960500	Yeah, but maybe this thing will run away.
961500	962500	What is that?
962500	963500	I kind of would...
963500	964500	Well, you're right.
964500	965500	We need to bring him in.
965500	966500	Well, okay.
966500	967500	Before you do that, I...
967500	969500	What if we just keep giving him smokies?
969500	973500	Ash is on the wrestling team, so Ash goes over and...
973500	975500	Well, fuck it.
975500	981500	Yeah, I go over, and I want to just full Nelson him and smash him onto the ground, and then
981500	983500	leg lock him, and then...
983500	985500	He's going to run away as soon as you approach him.
985500	990500	So as you run up to him to do this, or even walk up to him to do this, he's going to take
990500	993500	off running with the little smokies.
993500	1001500	In order to catch him before he dips, I need you to roll an athletics check against his own.
1006500	1007500	A 12 on a 30.
1007500	1008500	He rolled a 97.
1008500	1010500	Hell yes.
1010500	1011500	So you grab him.
1011500	1014500	Now we're going to go unarmed combat straight up and down against each other.
1014500	1015500	Can I support this?
1015500	1016500	I failed.
1016500	1018500	Passed with a 26 on a 50.
1018500	1023500	You describe what you do, and then Thomas, you can put yourself in the situation in a
1023500	1024500	positive space.
1024500	1027500	I get up from my slide.
1027500	1033500	I kick the can of little smokies before he can figure out how to open it up back kind
1033500	1035500	of towards where the pile of food is.
1035500	1036500	So what's important?
1036500	1039500	I give him a little elbow in the face since he...
1039500	1043500	Or actually, I give him a knee in the face since that's closer, and then while that's
1043500	1049500	kind of got him off guard, I just full Nelson him, push his face into the mud, and then
1049500	1054500	I lock my legs around his legs so that he is pretty much immobile.
1054500	1059500	You are a bloody muddy mess of a two clump person.
1059500	1062500	I want to take a rope that we...
1062500	1063500	Like Eddie Murphy.
1063500	1066500	Perhaps found in the camping equipment from the Bronco or the other car.
1066500	1067500	A hundred percent.
1067500	1070500	And I want to tie him up while Luke's got him...
1070500	1071500	Yeah.
1071500	1072500	Got him wrestled down.
1072500	1078500	If anyone knows how to tie up a naked man, it's Jeremy Pettymore.
1078500	1088500	Honestly, it falls far too often on the Pettymore children to hog tie the obliterated adults
1088500	1090500	at the family get together.
1090500	1094500	The other adults are too busy pouring more drinks, and they're just like, hey, handle
1094500	1095500	it, Jeremy.
1095500	1097500	That's his fourth jar of moonshine.
1097500	1100500	I get the rope ready.
1100500	1102500	Take his keys and grab the rope.
1102500	1108500	Well, once a kid is old enough to push a lawnmower, he's old enough to tie up his uncle when he's...
1108500	1111500	Which in the Pettymore family is like about three years old.
1111500	1117500	I really hope that there's a beautiful circular cross stitch that says that in every Pettymore
1117500	1121500	home.
1121500	1125500	I'm trying to remember something specific that was in an ex-girlfriend's parents' house.
1125500	1129500	It was basically just said that faith is...
1129500	1132500	Being certain of what you hope for and sure of what you cannot see?
1132500	1133500	Yeah.
1133500	1134500	Exactly.
1134500	1135500	I was raised.
1135500	1139500	The Pettymore one says, mow the lawn and tie up Don.
1139500	1141500	Holy shit.
1141500	1142500	Yeah.
1142500	1146500	And there's a little picture of Don D. Pettymore that's also like...
1146500	1152500	He's tied up and in the background, a little tiny Jeremy's just mowing the grass.
1152500	1153500	Anyway.
1153500	1154500	Anyway.
1154500	1157500	You guys have a tied up, naked, bloody man.
1157500	1165500	And currently, you both are also just covered in this blood and mud.
1165500	1169500	I'm gonna sanitize my hands with the hand sanitizer.
1169500	1170500	Oh shit.
1170500	1171500	Yeah.
1171500	1172500	That makes sense.
1172500	1173500	But other...
1173500	1174500	All the mud and shit.
1174500	1175500	Yeah.
1175500	1176500	We're like 14 year old boys out in the woods.
1176500	1177500	I think we probably feel pretty cool.
1177500	1178500	Yeah.
1178500	1179500	I bet you do.
1179500	1180500	All right.
1180500	1181500	Jeremy, are you also hand sanitizing?
1181500	1182500	No.
1182500	1183500	That's all I do though.
1183500	1187500	I keep all the mud and muck and blood on me, because I really don't have anything to clean
1187500	1188500	it off with.
1188500	1192500	I want to tie the wild man up to a tree.
1192500	1193500	Okay.
1193500	1197500	And then I kind of want to start trying to calm him down with another can of smoke.
1197500	1200500	One at a time, giving him little smokies.
1200500	1204500	And I'm trying to experiment with commands like, hey, sit.
1204500	1205500	Jeremy, stay.
1205500	1206500	You think I ought to...
1206500	1211500	I mean, I can just run real fast back to the shack and go get that old man.
1211500	1212500	Yeah.
1212500	1213500	Let's split up.
1213500	1214500	Okay.
1214500	1215500	Sounds good.
1215500	1216500	And I take off towards the shack.
1216500	1217500	Perfect.
1217500	1226500	Thomas, leave the room.
1226500	1246780	Luke, as Ash Hornbeam runs back down the trail, I need you to make a sanity check.
1246780	1249820	That is a pass of 38 on a 39.
1249820	1254500	You are still going to lose one sanity, putting your current sanity at 38 now.
1254500	1255500	Cool.
1255500	1265660	As you're running, the trees begin to warp and the trail becomes almost non-existent
1265660	1267780	in front of you.
1267780	1275100	And you are immediately looking at trees instead of the trail ahead of you.
1275100	1278740	And you turn around and it's just trees.
1278740	1282620	And you have no fucking clue where you are.
1282620	1283780	You're by yourself.
1283780	1290900	The sun is going down and you are in the woods of contention.
1290900	1296900	Exactly what I wanted to do.
1296900	1300100	Perfect.
1300100	1307420	Joe, Terry.
1307420	1311380	That's me.
1311380	1312380	Hey Joe.
1312380	1313380	Howdy.
1313380	1320180	I believe Ken Krenkelhoff was just walking down the trail, heading to his campsite.
1320180	1321220	Going to meet my buddies.
1321220	1322220	Going to meet your buddies.
1322220	1325260	I got a couple checks for you to roll on your way there.
1325260	1326260	Alrighty.
1326260	1327260	First one's a survival check.
1327260	1328860	Uh, I don't have my character sheet.
1328860	1330260	Oh yeah, I have your character sheet.
1330260	1333100	I was like, yeah, I'll just roll dice.
1333100	1334980	You tell me what happens.
1334980	1340540	I do eventually want to play a game where I am the only one who knows what you're like
1340540	1345260	search and alertness and sanity are.
1345260	1347360	And then we'll just describe it in character.
1347360	1350660	That way you guys never know if you pass or fail.
1350660	1351660	I think that'd be kind of fun.
1351660	1359380	It would take away some of the dice rolling aspect, but it is what it is.
1359380	1363300	I fail a 79 in my, you said survival, right?
1363300	1364300	I did indeed.
1364300	1365300	A 50.
1365300	1366300	So I fail.
1366300	1367300	Okay.
1367300	1370500	As you're walking down, you think to yourself, yes, this trail is exactly how I roll.
1370500	1373100	I remember it.
1373100	1379540	And now I need you to roll an alertness check.
1379540	1381060	I also fail that one.
1381060	1383340	An 87 on a 50.
1383340	1388260	All right, then nothing cool happens and you may as well fuck off.
1388260	1389260	It's for real?
1389260	1390260	No, I'm kidding.
1390260	1396260	So you're, uh, so you're walking down the trail and you make your way all the way back
1396260	1403040	to the campsite where you normally camp every year with Jeremy Pettymore and Ash Hornbeam.
1403040	1409100	And when you arrive from a distance, you can see two figures.
1409100	1418340	One is Jeremy Pettymore and the other is not Ash Hornbeam, but rather it is an adult man
1418340	1423900	who is naked, who is covered in blood and mud.
1423900	1431600	He's cut all over his body and he has been tied up hands and ankles and then tied to
1431600	1438320	a tree and Jeremy Pettymore is waving little Smokies in front of his face.
1438320	1439900	What the fuck?
1439900	1441100	Is he conscious?
1441100	1442100	Yes.
1442100	1444240	Little Smokies like the sausages.
1444240	1446640	What the fuck?
1446640	1463480	Everyone is going to say that as he enters the clearing.
1463480	1464480	Shark flips.
1464480	1467000	Do you have sharp toenails right now?
1467000	1468000	No, shark.
1468000	1469000	Shark.
1469000	1471800	I thought you were like cutting Ally with your...
1471800	1472800	Shark flip flops.
1472800	1473800	Did she do that?
1473800	1474800	Oh, all the time.
1474800	1476220	All the time.
1476220	1479720	Every time she comes in, she's like, look at me, I'm Sandra Dee and then she cuts me
1479720	1482260	with her toenails.
1482260	1486340	And then I have him put the blood in a vial and then I put it around my neck and then
1486340	1489180	we have hoard sex.
1489180	1492820	Call me Billy Bob Thornton.
1492820	1493820	Call me...
1493820	1495740	I don't get that.
1495740	1501580	He used to wear Angelina Jolie's blood around his neck in a vial and she did the same with
1501580	1502580	his blood.
1502580	1503580	That's a lie.
1503580	1504580	The 90s were crazy.
1504580	1505580	What the fuck?
1505940	1506940	That's a lie, right?
1506940	1511740	And then Brad Pitt was like, give me some of that lot of blood.
1511740	1512860	He wanted the blood, really.
1512860	1514100	He was just after the blood.
1514100	1516100	I've tasted blood.
1516100	1520100	Yeah, I think we all...
1520100	1522100	I think we've all tasted blood, Ally.
1522100	1523100	You're being weird about it.
1523100	1525460	I bite my lip on purpose every day.
1525460	1529540	Ally said that she's tasted blood in an actual...
1529540	1532660	You sat down and had a flight of blood or something.
1532660	1535540	You acted as if you have sucked it from a woman.
1535540	1536540	I've tasted blood.
1536540	1537540	Okay, whatever.
1537540	1538540	We've all done it.
1538540	1539540	Right, right.
1539540	1540540	A woman specifically?
1540540	1541540	What kind of blood are you talking about, Lindsay?
1541540	1543420	I said wound, but I meant wound.
1543420	1546220	So would a flight of blood be like the different blood types?
1546220	1547220	Oh.
1547220	1548220	Oh.
1548220	1549220	Yeah.
1549220	1550220	Like type O, positive.
1550220	1551220	That's a good one, Shadow.
1551220	1552340	Hey, name all the rest of them.
1552340	1555260	O negative, A, B, and C.
1555260	1558500	Oh, so close.
1558500	1559500	Is C a blood type?
1559500	1560500	It's not.
1560500	1562500	I think it's A and B. A and B are things, right?
1563340	1566340	I can't wait to tell someone that I'm blood type C.
1566340	1567340	A, B, O.
1567340	1568340	What blood type?
1568340	1569340	A, B, O.
1569340	1570340	C.
1570340	1571340	Um, C, bitch.
1571340	1573340	Universal donor.
1573340	1575340	Um, C.
1575340	1578340	I don't really know anything against C.
1578340	1580340	C plus, I think is what it is.
1580340	1581340	You know what they say.
1581340	1582340	C is get degrees.
1582340	1587340	I'm a C student, so I have C plus blood.
1587340	1592340	Do you think phlebotomists, when you leave, they're like, C plus.
1593180	1594180	Yes.
1594180	1597180	She clearly needed the crackers.
1597180	1600180	I always need the crackers.
1600180	1602180	Yeah, you're a C plus.
1602180	1603180	C.
1603180	1604180	I don't know why I keep doing that.
1604180	1606180	Why is not my reaction to things?
1606180	1607180	What are you doing?
1607180	1609180	I keep going.
1609180	1612180	It's an audio format, Taylor.
1612180	1614180	She's sticking her tongue out for you listeners out there.
1614180	1619180	And also like rolling her eyes in the back of her head while shoving both pinkies up her nose.
1619180	1622180	She's a little bit like a fish out of water with pinkies.
1623020	1625020	What if that was my initial reaction?
1625020	1630020	It was just like you say something like ever so subtly offensive and I go.
1630020	1631020	Oh my gosh.
1631020	1632020	Yeah, Taylor.
1632020	1633020	Oh dear God.
1633020	1635020	That'd be normal because that's what you do.
1635020	1636020	Because that's what I do.
1636020	1638020	Burn on me.
1638020	1639020	Burn myself.
1639020	1640020	I did it first.
1640020	1643020	So it's a joke.
1643020	1644020	We don't do that anymore.
1644020	1646020	That's so earlier in the episode.
1646020	1647020	Yeah, that's so.
1647020	1648020	That's so last episode.
1648020	1651020	That's so pre throw up Taylor.
1651020	1652020	Oh yeah.
1652860	1656860	Taylor, do you want to talk about what happened the first time we sat down to record?
1656860	1660860	You know how like when your friends just like relentlessly make fun of you so hard that
1660860	1663860	you start coughing and then you throw up in your hand and then you run to the bathroom
1663860	1667860	and then you throw up your guts for like five straight minutes while your friends sort of
1667860	1670860	laugh and awkwardly sit in a room?
1670860	1674860	What was I supposed to do if I went in there and I would throw up?
1674860	1675860	Same.
1675860	1678860	You could have thrown up with me.
1678860	1681860	It's a pretty big toilet.
1682700	1683700	It's pretty big.
1683700	1686700	Farts is just a joke toilet for farts.
1686700	1687700	For farts.
1687700	1690700	It just has a joke hole for farts?
1690700	1693700	You're not a part of turbo team.
1693700	1698700	Alright, let's hop right on back in.
1698700	1705200	You guys were in the parking lot and you were talking to Woodrow, the state ranger who is
1705200	1711020	now looking over the contention woods and he jumped out at you and said boo because
1711180	1715460	it's spoopy time as we said it's fall and he wants you to come to the shack and fill
1715460	1716780	out some forms.
1716780	1720700	Yeah, so if you don't mind just grab your camping gear, everything that you're gonna
1720700	1724680	bring on in with you and we can talk about what you brought with you that way we have
1724680	1730140	a slight inventory of what you have on your persons and then you can fill out some forms,
1730140	1733980	I'll take some pictures of you and then you'll head on into the woods.
1733980	1740280	This has never been protocol when Gary, I mean Jeb, used to do this.
1740280	1746280	Well Gary, I mean Jeb is missing currently and we're looking for him but state sent
1746280	1751040	me down here because there's about 18 missing people and I've got pictures and information
1751040	1756760	on all of them and so if you see any of them in their woods then you need to let me know.
1756760	1760440	We can get Officer Cox down here and take care of business.
1760440	1762640	I don't think so.
1762640	1768420	I don't know if you know my dad but he's like a lawyer and he really prefers when pictures
1768420	1772940	aren't taken of me and I don't fill out forms and I don't show you what's inside my bag
1772940	1773940	normally when I go places.
1773940	1778320	Oh, I don't need to look inside your bag, I just need to look at your face and take
1778320	1782540	a picture of it and then you can just tell me everything that you got now come on down
1782540	1783540	to the shack.
1783540	1784540	Whatever, can we just do this?
1784540	1785540	Let's just do this so we can just go.
1785540	1789940	I'm actually, I'm in witness protection program and so like my face can't be like photographed.
1789940	1794220	Young lady, if you're in witness protection program then you have given yourself up.
1794220	1798500	Okay, maybe I'm not in witness protection program but like, okay, fine, let's just do it.
1798500	1805180	Um, Shadow, like if this guy is asking to take our picture because if in case we go
1805180	1811340	missing then we should probably let him do it so the cops could find us if ever we were
1811340	1813980	still missing like those other 18 people maybe.
1813980	1817980	You hear, as he's walking away, he hollers back, he goes, that's exactly why we do it.
1817980	1820460	Judy, why is your mom's car even here?
1821420	1823740	Oh my gosh, oh no!
1823740	1833660	What if my mom is one of the 18 people that is missing maybe in the woods?
1833660	1838300	I wasn't implying that but like probably, but like what if it's not your mom?
1838300	1842700	Right, what if it's just someone else that also drives the same car as my mom and has
1842700	1845420	a bumper sticker on it that says world's greatest son?
1845420	1852300	You're right, it's probably someone else.
1852300	1855340	You're right, you're right, it's not my mom, it's not.
1855340	1856540	Everyone loves their son.
1856540	1857540	Calm down.
1857540	1860700	There's that same scratch on the side from probably some other kid that she had that
1860700	1865740	also accidentally ran their key onto it but it wasn't me, it was probably another kid.
1865740	1867980	Someone probably just stole your mom's van, so calm down.
1867980	1870460	Oh you're right, someone probably just stole it, it was totally fine.
1870460	1875340	They live in a gated community though, like is that possible to steal from the gated community?
1875580	1876540	It's possible, right?
1876540	1882220	It's totally fine.
1892460	1897740	Jeremy Pettymore, you are standing in front of this man.
1897740	1901180	Correction, I am kneeling, I'm trying to get on his eye level.
1901820	1903340	I'm letting him smell my hand.
1904060	1904560	Uh-huh.
1905020	1907100	And I'm giving him smokies with the other.
1907100	1908460	Yeah, a hundred percent.
1908460	1911340	And as you're doing that, you hear...
1911340	1911980	What the fuck?
1913100	1915660	Jeremy, what the fuck is going on?
1915660	1916300	Oh hey man.
1918620	1920140	Sir, sir, can you hear me?
1920140	1920860	And I'm talking to the...
1922220	1924700	Hey, did you talk to the ranger at all?
1925740	1926140	Yeah.
1926140	1928540	Take your Polaroid, you see all them missing folks?
1928540	1929020	Uh-huh.
1929020	1931260	Look at this here Polaroid of them missing folks.
1931260	1932460	Hey, he's one of them, right?
1932460	1933420	See the top left?
1933420	1938780	Jeremy shows you a Polaroid that was taken of the board of the missing people,
1938780	1943100	and there are tiny little Polaroids inside of this picture showing the faces.
1943100	1944700	You can kind of make out the faces.
1944700	1945580	Gotcha.
1945580	1946540	One of them is that guy.
1949100	1952700	Yeah, Ken looks back and forth, back and forth, squinty eyed, squinty eyed.
1952700	1955260	I guess it kind of looks like him.
1955900	1956860	You found him.
1956860	1958300	Yeah, we saved him.
1959180	1962620	And we tied him up and only wrestled with him a little bit,
1962620	1968460	and so Ash is on his way to the ranger station to take him back to civilization,
1968460	1970220	and I'm trying to tame him with smokeless.
1970860	1972060	Why's he bleeding?
1972060	1973340	Oh, he was like that when we found him.
1973340	1974300	How'd you find him?
1974300	1977420	Naked in the woods, acting like a wild man.
1977420	1979020	Ken, roll intelligence for me real quick.
1983260	1984700	Not my strong suit, but I passed.
1986300	1987980	You just took a biology lesson.
1988780	1990940	I passed with a two on a 25.
1990940	1995900	Two on a 25 would let you know that what Jeremy just told you
1995900	2000060	is that Ash just went down the trail, and you also...
2002380	2003420	I didn't see Ash.
2003420	2004620	I just came from the trail.
2005180	2005740	He wasn't there.
2005740	2006220	I didn't see him.
2006220	2007420	I mean, he just went down.
2007420	2008380	He just went down there.
2008380	2009180	I didn't see him.
2009180	2010060	I just came from the trail.
2010780	2011280	Fuck.
2012460	2012960	Ash!
2014300	2015020	Ash!
2019100	2020940	All right, don't lose your head right away.
2022380	2023740	Go ahead and roll sanity for me.
2023740	2024300	He's bloody!
2024300	2025020	He's bloody!
2026860	2028860	This is your first time seeing this man,
2028860	2032700	who is sniffing at Jeremy Pettymore's fingers.
2033260	2034060	Oh, damn.
2034060	2036140	It's a 36 on a 35.
2036140	2041980	Go ahead and make that a 34 for your current sanity as you lose one.
2041980	2042700	Jesus Christ.
2043580	2045740	Sanity loss really gets the indigestion going.
2045820	2050220	As that happens, Thomas, if you could plug your ears real quick.
2053580	2059820	Looking at this man, you no longer see humanity in his eyes,
2060540	2064220	and you can only see this animalistic intent
2064860	2069180	behind the eyes of this bloody, muddy, tied up human.
2069180	2069820	Okay.
2069820	2070620	You're good, Thomas.
2070620	2073580	I stuck my fingers in my ears and wiggled them around
2073580	2075340	so there was just a constant roar,
2075340	2078940	and any infection I might get tomorrow is on your conscience.
2080380	2081500	Non-existent, my dude.
2081500	2082460	What was on your fingers?
2083260	2084140	You know, just the day.
2085100	2089420	Also, I rubbed infection all over his fingers earlier.
2090460	2091980	That's what I call my pussy.
2095980	2099820	You get it tattooed, and the O is your clit.
2099820	2106540	It's a circle, and it says infection.
2106540	2107340	Like a teardrop.
2107340	2107660	All right.
2107660	2110220	So, no, no, no.
2111500	2113900	A circle tattoo above the clit.
2118700	2119740	All right, well.
2119740	2124540	You see Ken get startled and start backing up away from you both.
2124540	2125040	What the?
2125100	2125600	What the?
2126860	2127360	What's?
2130300	2131740	That's not a person.
2132300	2133420	Of course it's a person.
2134380	2135100	Look at his eyes.
2137100	2139260	He's like feral or some shit, Jeremy.
2139900	2141420	Okay, but he's still a man.
2142380	2142880	Jeez.
2144220	2148060	Did you think the fucking hunt for old Madge was just all gonna be like
2148620	2153500	civilized gentleman, and yes, yes, sir, and no, ma'am, and thank you, please?
2154060	2156060	No, it's wild fuckers in the woods.
2156060	2160220	We've never seen anything like this, Jeremy.
2160220	2164300	We were gonna roast marshmallows, and we were gonna tell ghost stories,
2164300	2167420	and we were gonna fall asleep way too early and wake up way too early.
2168220	2169340	Ken, he's real friendly.
2169340	2170540	Why don't you give him some fokies?
2170540	2171580	Give him some fokies.
2171580	2172700	Fuck no, I'm not going near him.
2172700	2173340	Give him some fokies.
2173340	2173840	Fuck no.
2175580	2176080	Ash!
2177420	2177920	Ash!
2178160	2178660	Ash!
2184240	2186160	I don't know why he's so scared of you, Rusty.
2187920	2188720	You named him?
2188720	2189360	Yeah, look at him.
2189360	2190640	He's a little rusty.
2190640	2192660	He got in that red dirt.
2207920	2212000	You're worse at getting a room noise than Luke.
2214240	2214880	Think about that.
2216640	2220080	Well, it's sort of, it's like you, uh, Mr. Rogers.
2220080	2223840	It's like a fucking nightmare trying to get a room noise with Luke.
2223840	2224720	Oh my God.
2224720	2227200	I mean, we're not doing this podcast anymore.
2227200	2227700	Yeah.
2228320	2233440	No, but it's like you, Mr. Rogers, us, where we just have to sit for one minute
2233440	2237200	and not make any noise, and you're like, what do I do?
2238000	2241520	You're going to want to have your mouth almost touching the microphone when you speak into it.
2241520	2241760	Okay.
2241760	2243760	But not farting into it like that other guy.
2244320	2245760	His name is Thomas.
2245760	2247120	His name is Thomas.
2247120	2248080	Right, Thomas.
2248080	2248960	Something petty more.
2250480	2251680	It's always something different.
2251680	2253200	It's always something petty more.
2254320	2254820	Gavin.
2255920	2256880	Gavin.
2256880	2257520	Gavin.
2257520	2258000	Gavin.
2258000	2261360	Gavin is such a little slut whore.
2261360	2263200	Frickin Gavin Pettymore.
2263200	2263700	Whoa.
2265200	2267120	We don't Gavin shame on this podcast.
2268240	2269760	All right.
2269760	2270080	Yeah.
2270080	2273760	Young ladies, if you want to come on down, we're trying to get this information.
2273760	2276800	You can get on into the woods and take care of business.
2276800	2279120	You hear from all the way in the shack.
2279120	2283360	Now he's all the way in there and there's a little like open window.
2283360	2284560	I don't know what you would call that.
2284560	2286720	Like, uh, that you would walk up to.
2286720	2287920	Like a concession window.
2287920	2288400	Exactly.
2288400	2290400	Thank you so much, Lindsay.
2290400	2291120	That was Lindsay.
2292800	2296240	I don't know why, but I just don't trust this guy.
2296240	2297840	Yeah, I don't trust him either.
2297840	2299760	Like he seems pretty scary.
2299760	2300160	Whatever.
2300160	2302560	He's not going to let us go into the woods until we take a picture.
2302560	2304400	So just like, let him take a picture of us.
2304400	2309200	But like, what if he's taking our picture because then he's going to make us disappear
2309200	2310960	and then he can put our picture up.
2310960	2311520	Yeah.
2311520	2316000	And also Elizabeth, it's like always easy for you to take a picture because you always
2316000	2319200	look so beautiful and like we don't.
2319200	2325920	Judy, we've been friends for so long and you used to call me beautiful and you don't anymore.
2325920	2327440	And I just like, don't even know why.
2327440	2332160	Like you used to tell me how wonderful and cute and sweet and hilarious I am.
2332160	2335440	And excuse me, when did this turn into some kind of competition?
2335440	2336960	Can we just go into the woods please?
2340720	2343600	That was Lindsay's voice and it made the funniest noise.
2344880	2346560	Was that inside your throat?
2347520	2347920	It was like,
2348160	2359360	I can't burp.
2360400	2362560	Like your body isn't capable of burping.
2362560	2364720	My body isn't capable of burping so it does this.
2372400	2373360	GMing is pain.
2374240	2375600	Sorry.
2378560	2379760	Being Lindsay is pain.
2384320	2385280	Oh my God.
2386960	2387600	Okay, fine.
2387600	2388960	Let's just take the picture.
2389760	2390000	Okay.
2390000	2396000	So when you guys walk up to the little shack at the entrance at the trailhead,
2396000	2398720	who has the best alertness?
2398720	2399680	I have 40.
2399680	2400480	I have 50.
2400480	2401200	I have 50.
2401200	2402800	Oh, two fifties.
2402800	2403120	All right.
2403120	2406160	Well, let's have both of you roll.
2406160	2406560	Why not?
2409600	2413280	I rolled a, wait, what's 30 and zero?
2413280	2413760	30.
2413760	2414640	I rolled a 30.
2415280	2416160	I rolled a 15.
2416160	2417600	What's 30 and zero?
2418800	2423200	30 plus zero is, hold on, let me do the numbers in my head.
2424640	2425120	Oh my God.
2425120	2426400	It was my first roll.
2426400	2427440	I'm so nervous.
2427440	2432000	Hey, that was both of your first rolls on this show and they both were successes.
2432480	2432980	Yes.
2434640	2436160	There's no way you won't die now.
2443280	2445040	Can you describe that face for our listeners?
2450480	2451760	It makes the exact same noise.
2457200	2459040	Who succeeded more is the thing.
2459040	2461120	So technically whoever got 15.
2461200	2461840	So Lindsay.
2461840	2462240	No.
2462240	2463920	So it's price is right rules.
2464560	2466560	Oh, so I win.
2466560	2467920	Judy wins the role.
2467920	2468400	Fuck you.
2468400	2469200	I'm more alert.
2469200	2471120	But you both see everything.
2472160	2473760	You both see everything.
2474400	2478400	So in this little shack, there are some clipboards hanging on the walls.
2478960	2481920	You've got one fire extinguisher.
2482560	2487200	There is one ax, one machete, one flashlight.
2487200	2492800	There's a giant thing of hand sanitizer that is sitting out on the like front, on the ledge.
2492800	2494240	What's a ledge of a window called?
2494240	2495040	A sill.
2495040	2496160	It's on the sill.
2496160	2498720	And there's, let's see what else.
2498720	2506800	Behind him, behind Woodrow is a bulletin board with many Polaroid pictures thumbtacked into
2506800	2508960	the bulletin board with a sheet of paper.
2508960	2512080	It's got information on it, like behind each picture.
2512080	2517280	And he says, yeah, no, these are all the people who have gone into the woods.
2517280	2521600	And then he like kind of points at one side of them are sectioned off.
2521600	2523760	And he's like, and those are the ones that are missing.
2523760	2525680	So obviously be careful in there.
2527280	2529520	Do I have something I can like take a picture of it with?
2529520	2531360	Probably not in the nineties.
2531360	2534720	Probably not in the time that we're in right now.
2534720	2539200	But I have a Polaroid that I can take a picture of you and it with.
2539200	2540320	I can give you a picture of that.
2540320	2543200	That way, you know what the pictures of the people look like who are in the pictures.
2543200	2545920	That way, when you're in the woods and if you see one of them, then you could let me
2545920	2546420	know.
2547120	2549600	So, and then he just snaps a picture of Liz.
2549600	2554000	I don't want to be counterproductive to what we're doing right now, but it sort of seems
2554000	2558160	weird that 18 people have gone missing in the woods and you're still letting us go into
2558160	2562160	the woods as female minors without any adult supervision.
2562160	2567760	Well, I don't see age or gender, but I do see three very capable young ladies who are
2567760	2569520	looking to have a good time in the woods this evening.
2569520	2574400	So Liz, I already know your name for some reason because you must have told me earlier.
2574400	2580480	So Liz Longley, he looks down at the piece of paper and he's like, let's see here.
2580480	2582880	What is your business in the woods this evening?
2582880	2583680	I just want to camp.
2584480	2585840	I just really want to camp.
2585840	2586160	Okay.
2586160	2587760	And did you bring anything?
2587760	2589680	And he's reading off the sheet.
2589680	2593920	Did you bring anything that is not camping gear?
2593920	2594560	No.
2594560	2595360	Okay.
2595360	2601920	And if you were to go missing, where would we look for you first in order to find you
2601920	2602400	quickest?
2604240	2606880	Are you sure you're not out here trying to paint your nose?
2606880	2610880	Cause you're looking all higgly piggly and I'm just worried that y'all are going to be
2610880	2612080	out here raising sand.
2612080	2615120	And I guess, I don't know, like in a tree.
2615120	2615840	In a tree.
2615840	2616640	All right.
2616640	2618640	This one's got a cap and wumpus mind.
2618640	2620240	And I like that about you.
2620240	2620640	All right.
2620640	2625360	So, uh, he writes all that down and then he sticks the picture in the thumbtack and throws
2625360	2633200	it up on the board of the side of the non-missing and his attention turns to shadow and he picks
2633200	2637040	up the Polaroid and lifts it up and snaps a picture of you.
2637040	2638240	What's that picture look like?
2638240	2638720	Gaunt.
2639440	2640400	Kind of deadly.
2641440	2643760	And when I say deadly, I don't mean like the picture could kill.
2643760	2647680	I mean like the person in the picture was killed and looks a little dead.
2648560	2650080	Um, it's, it's my makeup.
2650080	2651040	It's, it's not like...
2652000	2654400	I just meant what face were you making, but that's fine.
2654400	2654900	Yeah.
2655760	2656400	I like this.
2657600	2658640	Deadly and gaunt.
2659680	2661360	Like dead-ish.
2661360	2662240	Not really deadly.
2662880	2664480	You know, like just like dead-like.
2665280	2666320	Similar to death.
2666320	2668080	And I think that's all that needs to be described.
2669520	2670080	Wow.
2670080	2671840	You were just barking on a knot out here.
2671840	2672800	What's your name?
2672800	2673680	Shadow.
2673680	2674560	All right.
2674560	2675360	That's it.
2675360	2677840	Is that a normal name for these times?
2677840	2678720	What year is it?
2678720	2679280	You don't know?
2679280	2679760	I don't know.
2681040	2681920	Let's leave it at that.
2682640	2682960	Yeah.
2682960	2684000	My name is Shadow.
2684000	2686160	That's what my parents wanted to call me.
2686160	2686480	Sure.
2686480	2687120	Of course.
2687120	2688960	And, uh, same question.
2688960	2690480	What are you doing out here in the woods?
2691920	2699440	We're just trying to find ourselves through the earth and the moon and everything that
2699440	2702960	crawls on the earth and the moon.
2702960	2703840	All right.
2703920	2706160	Well, and what else do we got here?
2706160	2708000	He's reading off the paper again.
2708000	2708480	Oh yeah.
2709280	2710560	Do you bring anything with you?
2710560	2713760	You seem like you might've brought something with you that's not camping gear.
2713760	2716000	What with your earthly moon activities?
2716000	2720320	I just brought some like crystals so that we could find our auras.
2720880	2721200	Yeah.
2721200	2722000	All right.
2722000	2726480	And lastly, but not leastly, if you were to go missing, where would I might find you?
2726480	2732560	I probably would go in like a tree that's like taller than the one Liz was in and like
2732560	2734480	stronger, but like a tree.
2734480	2734800	Bitch.
2735920	2738240	Y'all seem to have a real nice rapport.
2738240	2739840	And for you, what is your name?
2739840	2740480	Young Liz.
2741280	2741520	Miss.
2742080	2743040	My name's Judy.
2744240	2750000	And Judy is like far too busy furiously pumping the hand sanitizer in her hand.
2750000	2752320	She's just pumping the hand sanitizer into her hand.
2753360	2755120	Like it's falling out of her hand.
2755120	2758160	Liz is just staring at her like she's just so appalled.
2758800	2759200	Awesome.
2760160	2763680	Uh, any hand sanitizer for the other two?
2763680	2764800	Absolutely not.
2765760	2769600	I prefer to be like one with the germs that want to enter my body.
2769600	2772480	My mom always said sanitize saves lives.
2772480	2777440	I agree that the saving of lives can be easily attained by sanitizing.
2777440	2779760	And I would suggest that both of you take
2779760	2785680	Ashford into the initiative that your friend here did as well in order to have clean hands.
2785680	2788240	Could we save our lives with like that machete?
2788240	2789120	I hope not.
2789120	2790080	What does that mean?
2790080	2795120	I mean, like if something is out there killing people like maybe Judy's mom,
2795120	2797680	like I'm just wondering if we could like take the machete with us.
2797680	2800160	Why would you say that?
2800160	2802800	And Judy starts like licking the hand sanitizer.
2804240	2805440	Oh my God.
2807440	2808080	Jinx.
2808080	2810880	And what is your reason for being in the woods here?
2810880	2812800	My clean and new friend.
2812800	2814240	I'm just here with my friends.
2814400	2819120	Uh, we're just camping just for normal camping reasons.
2819120	2820880	And I'm just doing whatever they are doing.
2822800	2825920	And you don't seem like one to take initiative,
2825920	2829760	but did you bring anything with you that is not also for camping?
2829760	2832480	I don't have anything except the sanitizer.
2832480	2832960	I'm sorry.
2832960	2833760	I stole it.
2833760	2834720	It's not stealing.
2835280	2838400	I will now offer it to both of your friends.
2838400	2841280	That way, you know that I would have offered it to you as well.
2841280	2843280	And if you would like more, you can have some.
2843280	2843840	Thank you.
2843840	2847120	He like puts his hand on top of it and moves it toward you.
2847120	2848720	And he's like, do you want to pump?
2848720	2850560	I don't believe in sanitation.
2850560	2853840	I sort of think that like when people are supposed to die from germs,
2853840	2855440	they should just let it happen.
2855440	2860080	I put my hand out and as he pumps, I pull my hand away and let it fall on the floor.
2860720	2860960	Okay.
2860960	2862960	I need you to roll dexterity for me.
2864800	2865440	53.
2866160	2866960	53.
2868000	2868720	53.
2869440	2870640	53 on what?
2870640	2871840	What is your dexterity?
2871840	2872340	Oh.
2873300	2875140	Yeah, that would be a 50.
2875140	2876580	Oh, that's a fail.
2876580	2884180	So right before your hand gets out of the way, quite a bit of hand sanitizer glooshes
2884180	2885380	right onto those palms.
2887140	2889060	Right onto those pinchy boys.
2889060	2896020	And you get hand sanitizer and it's like too much that you couldn't even like wipe it like together.
2896020	2898340	I turn to Judy and I'm like, Judy, hold your hand out.
2898980	2899700	Okay.
2899700	2901700	Are you gonna touch my hand with your hand?
2901700	2903620	I put some hand sanitizer in my hand, please.
2904340	2906740	Well, I was going to, but now I'm not going to.
2906740	2907700	Okay, that's totally cool.
2907700	2909940	I don't even care that much, so it's fine.
2909940	2911220	So do you rub it in?
2911220	2912740	Yeah, you know.
2912740	2914260	This is what role playing is all about.
2917620	2918420	All right, cool.
2918420	2922340	And I've got another question here for this timid one.
2922980	2925940	What is your reason for not being here?
2925940	2927460	I've already filled out that one.
2927460	2931460	He's looking at the sheet and he's like, uh, yeah, you bring anything?
2931460	2933380	No, I already wrote that down as well.
2933380	2933940	Oh yes.
2933940	2937460	If you were to be hiding in the woods somewhere, where am I to re-find you?
2939140	2942180	Probably just like on the top of my head.
2942980	2946100	Probably just like whatever tree Liz is in.
2946100	2947220	It's probably where I'd be.
2948020	2951860	Whatever tree Liz is in.
2951860	2954580	Takes him a while to write it down, but he gets it done.
2954580	2958660	And the thumbtacks with the pictures go up on the board in the non-missing section.
2958740	2960980	And he looks back up and he says,
2960980	2964900	well, I think that each of you should have an excellent day.
2964900	2967460	And, uh, yeah.
2967460	2973220	And you notice as he turns around to post the thumbtacks into the bulletin board,
2973220	2979220	you see that there's a slight trickle of blood going down the back of his neck.
2979220	2983860	And it is starting to stain the uniform that he is wearing.
2989060	3004340	Ash horn beam is looking around at the sun going down.
3004340	3008580	He's looking around at just trees surrounding him.
3010180	3014420	And then he hears a noise and looking in the direction of this noise,
3014420	3022100	you see that there's a tree that is emitting light from like a hollow point.
3022740	3023780	What are those called?
3023780	3025700	I know exactly what you're talking about.
3025700	3027380	They're like little round.
3027380	3029780	Yeah, I used to, there was one in my yard.
3029780	3031220	I used to put stuff in.
3031220	3031700	Exactly.
3031700	3032420	It's one of those.
3032980	3034100	It's like where you drop off.
3034740	3037540	It's like, put the money in the tree hole.
3037540	3040180	And, uh, with that in your mind, you think,
3040180	3042100	oh, there might be some loud money over here.
3046260	3051380	And you see that there is a bright light shining from inside this hole.
3051380	3056020	When I look around, am I in like a hollow or is it just trees all around?
3056020	3057460	Just trees all around.
3057460	3061540	Can I do a search to see if I've, is there anything else unusual around me?
3061540	3062180	Go ahead and roll.
3064980	3066580	21 on a 40.
3066580	3075940	There seems to be some sort of wire trip wire in between you and this bright light
3075940	3077380	shining tree that's making this noise.
3077380	3082180	Okay, well I'm going to make my way over to the tree, carefully avoiding the trip wire.
3082180	3084820	Carefully avoiding the trip wire and you're safe now.
3086820	3087940	That is what I do.
3087940	3089860	Stepping carefully over the trip wire.
3089860	3093780	You feel this like great sense of pride in yourself.
3093860	3097780	And I also, I turn back at the trip wire and I wink and I give it finger guns.
3098580	3101460	The camera is pointed from up from the trip wire.
3101460	3103140	That way you're looking directly into camera.
3103140	3104580	Right directly into camera.
3104580	3107220	And I go, not this time audience.
3108820	3109380	It's good.
3109380	3109780	Good.
3109780	3110580	Break the fourth wall.
3110580	3111140	It's important.
3111140	3118420	So you are on the other side and you are right near this tree and you see that this light
3118420	3124420	is emitting so brightly lit from inside the tree that you can't see what is inside this
3124420	3127380	crevasse, this wooden crevice.
3128340	3129940	But there's something inside.
3129940	3131220	There's something deep in there.
3131220	3134900	If I get like right up near it, it's not like blinding light, is it?
3134900	3135140	No.
3135140	3139060	If I get like right up near it, how big is the whole face sized?
3139060	3142020	No, it's more like a forearm sized.
3142020	3142740	Oh, okay.
3142740	3148180	Well, I think how convenient is that?
3148180	3153540	And I stick my hand into the hole and feel around up to my elbow.
3153540	3157460	You stick your hand into the hole up to your elbow.
3157460	3160820	Do I feel like the bottom or the sides of it up to my elbow?
3160820	3161140	Yes.
3161140	3161620	Okay.
3161620	3165780	And inside you feel nothing.
3167700	3169140	I'm going to sniff the hole.
3170020	3175620	Well, your forearm is currently covering all the holes, so there's no more light emitting
3175620	3179380	and your forearm seems to fit perfectly up to the elbow inside this hole.
3179380	3182740	Okay, I pull my arm out after feeling nothing or do I?
3182740	3189460	As you attempt to pull your arm out, you feel a great pain on your skin.
3189460	3190420	Up to my elbow?
3190420	3191300	All the way.
3191300	3195380	Think of it like you have your arm inside of a catfish.
3196340	3200180	I can actually vividly imagine that, yeah.
3200180	3208900	Now imagine that the whole internal insides of a catfish are razor sharp all the way down
3208900	3210660	from elbow to fingertip.
3210660	3214740	Dang, so this is like noodling but in the woods instead of the water.
3214740	3218900	Are you going to attempt to pull your arm out slowly?
3219940	3224980	Very slowly because I'm thinking like if they're like pointed in to where like
3225060	3229220	I don't hurt myself if I stay here but pulling out would be worse.
3229220	3230900	Or like a finger trap.
3230900	3238660	It is very similar to both of those ideas as you lose one hit point and the skin that
3238660	3245540	makes its way out probably a centimeter's worth is not there anymore and it is just
3245540	3245540	
3245540	3249300	Completely like not scratches or anything just completely raw.
3249300	3249540	Yep.
3250420	3254260	And you realize that you are trapped.
3254980	3266820	Ash Hornbeam hasn't maybe ever felt this way before but he doesn't know what to do.
3284980	3298820	She knows
3300260	3302820	That the time has come
3306260	3312820	To dance beneath the dance beneath the shadow of the moon
3314980	3338820	She moves
3339780	3342660	With the howling wind
3346340	3354660	The sun has come again
3357780	3366660	Her eyes have seen it all
3368820	3380660	The wonders of the wonders of the shadow of the moon
