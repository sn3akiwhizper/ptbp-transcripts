0	9840	Well, babies, I cannot believe I finally arrived at Ocean City, New Jersey, and it's 2016?
9840	11400	And it's March?
11400	15360	Well, fuck, this should be a fun detour, I guess.
15360	17000	God damn it.
17000	18760	I guess...
18760	22200	Guess I can do another radio show or something.
22200	27880	We're live from 694.2 PTBP or whatever.
27920	30640	Some nice person wrote us a thing.
30640	32080	Maybe I'll read that.
32080	38320	This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Dale Armont in Arkansas, who tweeted about the
38320	44120	show and tagged at Pretending Pod, which is always the third thing I do while sitting
44120	45120	on the toilet.
45120	46840	Do you sit down to pee?
46840	48260	I sure do.
48260	49760	It's comfy.
49760	56360	Thanks for tweeting about the show and tagging at Pretending Pod Dale Armont from Arkansas.
56360	57360	He writes,
81840	84000	Oh wow, Dale.
84000	91000	A Wolfie never reveals their secrets, especially secrets about their incredibly moisturized
91000	92000	nipples.
92000	93000	Wink.
93000	97960	If you want to write up something for your wolf to how, send in your message as a five-star
97960	104680	review on Apple Podcasts, and I'll read it here on 694.2 PTBP.
104680	111040	Ocean City, New Jersey's newest and only radio station, probably.
111040	117200	And I'll be right back after a word from our only sponsor, Zach.
117200	118200	What's up, what's up?
118200	119200	It's Zach.
119200	120680	I am here to tell you four things.
120680	124460	First, I want to say thank you to this community.
124460	132440	After some last minute donations from you folks, we've raised $1,525 to help keep
132440	135840	Springfieldians warm this winter.
135840	138000	That's absolutely incredible.
138000	142200	Thank you to each and every one of you listening who's told a friend about the show or joined
142200	144980	the Patreon or tagged us on the internet.
144980	147280	This is all thanks to you.
147280	152360	Second, I want to say thank you to all of you eager listeners for your patience.
152360	153720	Here's a little life update.
153720	159600	Taylor and I have moved back to Springfield, Missouri, and we will be in Springfield, Missouri
159600	164380	until we eventually die in Springfield, Missouri.
164380	165380	We love it here.
165380	166440	The food game is strong.
166440	167440	It's cheap.
167480	172780	We just started a big boy job at a real company and we're about to move into a rental while
172780	176680	we house hunt in this super fun market.
176680	183880	I'm hoping the transition won't affect our release schedule too much, but I'm an optimist
183880	184880	for real though.
184880	190160	We have some really cool shit planned and we're all super stoked about it.
190200	196320	Third, we just recently released our 27th Patreon bonus episode.
196320	201880	Luke GM'd a game of Uncanny Rally for Joe, Thomas, and me.
201880	205840	It's one of those one-page RPGs from Grant Hallett.
205840	209360	We played malfunctioning military androids on the run.
209360	215060	It was delightfully silly and Luke did a wonderful job leading us on our wacky way.
215060	223900	So for $5 a month you can hear that and 26 other bonus episodes which do include a 13
223900	231420	episode long mostly homebrew Delta Green campaign that winds through time by connecting surviving
231420	239620	agents from each mission to continued unnatural mysteries and military conspiracies.
239620	246060	And finally, if you're an esteemed naughty denizen of the den of sin, get ready for this
246060	253460	Thursday, the eve of New Year's Eve, January 30th at 7pm Central Time.
253460	259500	We're gonna hang out and celebrate the end of 2021, talk about our plans for 2022, and
259500	266040	we're also each in charge of bringing a segment to the episode, so we'll see what happens
266040	267660	with that.
267660	272420	If you have any suggestions, post them on the internet.
272420	279820	And come hang out this Thursday night, yeah, New Year's Eve, January 30th at 7pm Central
279820	280820	Time.
280820	286280	Okay, sorry that took so long, thanks for listening to our podcast, bye.
286280	291780	If that sad Zach character gave you the blues, and God knows he gives me the blues, you're
291780	295180	welcome to cheer up now, it's time for the news.
295420	302620	A former Delta Green agent named Arvon Chilton is missing and on the run today after a string
302620	308080	of brutal homicides have all pointed in his singular direction.
308080	312100	He is assumed to be armed and dangerous.
312100	317260	Again, this is a former Delta Green agent named Arvon Chilton.
317260	324200	Mr. Chilton parked his car in the driveway of his ex-wife, Eileen McCarty, and her new
324200	326920	husband, Marcus McCarty.
326920	335000	Then, this fucking dude, Arvon Chilton, walked inside, disabled and tied up the new husband,
335000	339320	and then slowly cut Eileen McCarty to pieces in front of the guy.
339320	345540	Later, Arvon Chilton carefully cut out the new husband's eyes, all before he disemboweled
345540	350040	and untied the blind, bleeding out broken man.
350200	355680	Marcus McCarty died sometime later, crawling towards the front door.
355680	358080	Welcome to 694.2.
358080	363640	If you aren't down with that level of awful, this show might not be good for you.
363640	370200	But for now, let's just groove on this melodic palate cleanser that's brand spanking new.
370200	374680	It's Brian Bolger with Bad in a Good Way.
380040	385480	The deep end, but the drowning's been just fine
385480	393800	And when my ears pop and the shell shock of this pit stop frees my mind
393800	401960	I'll be alright, I can go there now that I've stared death in the face
401960	409640	I'll be alright, I can go there now that I've stared death in the face
414200	416360	Welcome to Pretending to Be People.
416360	421880	We're gonna play Control Copy, which is a Delta Green scenario written by Dennis Detwiller,
421880	426280	one of the creators of the game, Delta Green, the Role Playing Game.
426280	428280	Yeah!
428280	430280	Oh, too much.
432120	435720	We are playing Control Copy specifically because we put up a poll
439880	441560	on our Patreon.
441560	443800	And only those who pay us money could vote.
443800	448840	And only those who pay us money could vote, and they chose Control Copy.
448840	453800	Hey, let's introduce ourselves to anyone who is listening to this who hasn't listened to us before.
453800	457400	My name is Zach, and I'm gonna be your handler today,
457400	461720	as well as after you listen to this when you go back and listen to all of season one,
461720	464840	of Pretending to Be People, I'll be the handler for that as well.
464840	469240	I'm Joe! I play. I'm one of the characters. I play in all the games.
470760	471720	Every single one of them.
473720	477880	What is your role, Joe? How do you see your role here at Pretending to Be People?
477880	482280	I think the most official role I have is note taker, and even that's tenuous at times,
482280	485640	because I get involved in what's happening and forget to write stuff down.
485640	488120	That happens to everybody, man. That's role playing, baby.
488120	488840	Yeah, that's what my problem is.
488920	492920	That's happened to Luke and I for the last 60 episodes.
492920	494120	I was so enthralled.
496280	502200	I'm Luke. I play, too. And my goal, my role...
502200	503080	What's your goal?
503080	503960	Goal? Have fun.
504680	505960	Role. Have fun.
507720	510840	I don't take notes.
513960	514760	They're all up here.
515320	517000	He points at his head.
517000	517880	Yeah, audio.
519320	520600	He pointed at Joe's notebook.
523000	528280	But yeah, you know, I just kind of go with the flow, and I try to get things rolling, you know?
528920	530600	Yes, you certainly do that.
530600	534760	You can really feel the energy just, like, shooting off of him.
536520	540360	I'm Thomas, and sometimes I take notes, and...
541160	544040	I thought that this just became whether or not you take notes.
544040	544760	Notes or no notes.
544760	546760	I plan to take notes on this campaign.
547640	549480	Joe was like, I'm Joe, and I'm a character,
549480	552120	so I just want to make it clear that I'm Thomas, and I'm a person.
553720	555400	But I do play characters on the show.
557400	562120	All right, so that's us, and this is Delta Green,
562120	564760	and we're going to play Delta Green.
565320	566440	Are you guys ready to play Delta Green?
566440	567320	I'm scared.
568680	571960	Normally, on season one of Pretending to Be People,
571960	576120	we played an amalgamation of Delta Green and Pulp Cthulhu.
576520	580440	And you guys had lots of hit points and luck to spend.
580920	585800	However, in this game today, you will have no special talents.
585800	589080	Your hit points will be your strength plus your con,
589640	595000	divided by two, as opposed to just strength plus con,
595640	597880	and you will have no luck.
598520	602120	So let's introduce your characters.
602120	604840	A young boy, far larger than average for his age,
605800	608360	sits crying in the hallway of an elementary school
608360	610440	as a group of children laugh and run away.
611400	615240	He's wearing a yellow long-sleeve t-shirt and blue overalls.
615240	618200	His glasses are thick, thick enough to give the illusion
618200	621000	that the wearer has cartoonishly giant eyes.
621000	623560	The tears are magnified behind the glass lenses
623560	626680	as he sniffles and laughs echo down the hallway.
626680	629560	A small boy approaches the weeping, hulking figure.
629560	631560	They're assholes, fuck them.
631560	633000	What's your name, Bigfoot?
635320	636280	Kevin.
636280	638280	The crying boy says as he wipes his face
638280	641560	and looks up at the acne-ridden face of Elwood Boyd.
641560	643400	Kevin wipes the sweat from his face
643400	645640	and looks up into the stadium lights.
645640	647720	The light glints off his athletic goggles,
647720	649560	which give his eyes a bulging look.
650280	658280	Menyen! Menyen! Menyen! Menyen! Menyen! Menyen! Menyen!
658280	661080	The crowd chants his nickname as he stands on the field,
661080	663320	towering above the other boys surrounding him.
663720	664520	Hike!
664520	666120	The sound of young men shouting
666120	668520	and football pads clashing fills the air.
668520	671960	Kevin throws the boy opposite him to the ground with a crunch.
671960	674040	His eyes focus on the opposing quarterback
674040	675800	and he launches himself forward.
675800	678120	The small, frail boy holding the football
678120	680280	is almost invisible under Kevin's shadow
680280	682680	as the monstrous high schooler leaps towards him.
682680	684680	Ahh!
684680	688200	A piercing scream is heard as Kevin smashes into the child,
688200	689800	sending the boy flying backwards
689800	691560	and the football up into the air.
692120	693800	Kevin jumps up to grab the ball
693800	695560	and sprints towards the end zone.
695560	697640	The entire crowd is chanting his name
697640	699400	as he hulks toward the goal.
699400	701480	When the minion reaches the end of the field,
701480	703480	he spikes the football down.
703480	705320	Instead of bouncing back into the air,
705320	708040	the ball burrows itself into the earth.
708040	709240	What's your last name again?
709240	710280	Gelato.
710280	713960	That's another defensive touchdown
713960	719000	for Kevin Gelato and the Spiro Agnu High!
719000	720520	Nope, I already have this written out.
721960	728360	That's the end of the minions five undefeated years
728360	730120	here at Spiro Agnu High!
730840	734040	The announcer shouts as the crowd runs onto the field.
734040	735640	I'm so proud of you bro!
735640	737960	You're gonna do big things!
737960	740040	The voice of Stuart, Kevin's younger brother,
740040	743720	fades out as we see Kevin standing in an elegant hallway
743720	745320	with a dumb smile on his face.
745880	748520	The smile quickly fades into a stony expression
748520	750120	as Elwood's voice fades in,
750120	752440	asking questions not necessarily intended
752440	753720	to be answered by Kevin.
754280	756280	Kevin gives Elwood a quick smile,
756280	758840	but the eyes behind his goggles are deeply sad.
760200	762200	Okay Elwood, let's go.
763080	763580	Nice!
764360	765240	And Elwood.
765240	765740	Hey!
767240	768440	I'm playing Elwood.
768440	769800	Elwood Boyd.
770680	773400	And see Kevin, if I turn this here, click,
774040	776840	and I snip this here, we should get...
777560	779640	And a safe door slowly opens in front of them,
779640	782520	revealing a cartoonish horde of jewels and cash.
783080	786280	A smile spreads across Elwood Boyd's pale, pockmarked,
786280	789240	and pimpled face, revealing rows of yellowed teeth
789240	791320	that seem to have all collectively decided
791320	792920	no two would grow in the same angle.
796760	799080	He stands wearing an argyle sweater vest
799080	800920	over a yellow-brown colored button-up,
800920	802680	khaki pants, and golfing shoes,
802680	804840	but the whole ensemble looks like it was recently
804840	808040	retrieved from a dumpster, all wrinkled and lightly,
808040	809880	and in some places not so lightly,
809880	812040	stained and fitting poorly.
812040	814520	Kevin hands Elwood a fresh duffel bag,
815160	817240	and Elwood extends a thin, bony arm
817240	819240	to start scooping in the latest score.
819240	820760	See, there's nothing to it.
820760	823240	Well, at least for me, I don't know how you'd fare.
823240	826200	But it's like I can see the inner workings of these things.
829240	829960	I always have.
829960	831320	I don't know where this comes from.
832600	833640	Here, take this bag too.
834280	836760	And Elwood stands and hands another duffel bag
836760	837560	over to Kevin.
838200	840520	He now has three draped over his body.
840520	842440	All right, so we've gone through every room, right?
842440	843400	I started to lose track.
843400	844360	This place is so big.
844920	847560	You said this guy was some kind of money manager or something.
847560	848600	Hoo-wee!
848600	849960	Must be good in the manage-
849960	850680	money management.
850680	851000	Fuck.
853240	856200	Must be good in the money management.
856200	857240	Hoo-wee!
857240	859160	Must be good money managing that money.
862360	863160	Let's try it again.
863160	867480	Must be good money in managing that money.
867480	868840	Come on, let's get out of here.
868840	870520	We gotta go see Julian.
870520	873080	They make their way toward the garage at this point,
873720	875960	passing rooms that have obviously been picked over.
875960	877800	There's things kind of scattered here and there,
877800	879720	but it's mostly empty rooms at this point.
879720	882440	They walk by a kitchen and there's a guy sprawled on the floor
883160	884200	just in his boxers.
885000	887320	Man, you really whacked him good, big guy.
887320	888760	Yeah, he'll be out for hours.
889800	891080	Right before they get to the garage door,
891080	895480	they see a picture on the wall and it's of a family all-
895480	900680	I'm sorry, he jacked that guy off so good that he passed out for hours?
901320	902360	Really got him.
902360	903160	Whatever you say.
904760	907560	There's a family photo on the wall right by the garage door
907560	909720	of a family in like a fall setting.
910520	912440	Hey, you almost forgot one, dummy.
912440	915400	Even though it's just a picture, there's good money in frames.
915400	916280	We can sell the frame.
916840	917960	They get out to the garage.
917960	920200	They load up the SUV of the homeowner.
920200	922200	Elwood waits in the passenger seat.
922200	924280	Come on, come on, we don't have all day.
924280	926040	Well, I guess we kind of do.
926040	928600	I already snipped the alarms and I took care of the cameras
929480	931960	and the security guy at the gate, you took care of him.
932680	933800	But anyway, I want to get out of here.
933800	934840	Come on, let's go.
934840	940680	Kevin walks out the door with a frame and three double bags.
941720	944360	Everything's just like packed on this dude like a mule.
946120	947880	That's how it was picture made for sure.
947880	951160	Is this happening in the present day or like shortly after that high school game?
951160	952360	No, this is present day.
952360	955240	Yeah, you were daydreaming about that when we were doing this.
957240	958040	That's actually perfect.
960520	964440	They pull up into an old camera shop and they pull around the back.
964440	967640	They've done it a million times before and they're greeted by Julian.
967640	968680	Oh, he's your fence.
968680	969400	He's my fence.
969400	970120	Got you.
970120	972360	Comes out and says, what'd you bring for me today?
972360	973480	Oh, just the usual.
973480	977720	Some vases, socks, books, candlesticks, jewelry, bedsheets.
978360	979720	Kevin, tell some of the keys.
979720	980840	You got your car?
980840	981240	All right.
981240	983800	Julian cuts them off and says, hey, smelly Ellie.
983800	985640	You know I only care about the jewels, right?
985640	987880	You don't have to make me sell people's socks.
987880	988840	They're used.
988840	990120	Elwood replies.
991640	993080	Hey, they still work, don't they?
993080	996040	That means they have value to somebody and that means they have value to me.
996040	996440	Socks.
997160	997720	Socks.
997720	1000440	Usually there's even some cash in this frame, I'm sure.
1001320	1004040	Oh, Elwood, you took the family photos.
1005480	1009240	He, uh, he assures them that there's going to be, uh, some cash form in a week.
1009240	1009800	Okay.
1009800	1011000	After he sells all this stuff.
1011000	1011400	Yeah.
1011400	1015640	And, uh, Elwood turns to Kevin and says, all right, let's, uh, let's head back home.
1015640	1016920	Maybe Ma's made chili.
1016920	1017640	Oh yeah.
1018360	1019000	Chili.
1019000	1021960	So they get back to Elmira Boyd's basement apartment.
1021960	1022600	Okay.
1022600	1025560	And oh, they noticed the TV's on.
1025560	1026200	Oh shit.
1026200	1026920	She's still awake.
1026920	1027160	All right.
1027160	1028040	Come, come, come on.
1028600	1029240	Is this your mom?
1030760	1032040	Hey, hey, hey ma.
1032040	1033400	Um, we're, we're home.
1033960	1034600	Home.
1034600	1038680	Uh, Elmira Boyd is laying on the couch in her nightgown and she stirs awake.
1038680	1039480	Kind of startled.
1040600	1043320	Oh, did you boys have fun at the golf range?
1044760	1047800	Uh, Elwood says, yeah, I hit two holes in one.
1047800	1048440	Hole in one.
1049960	1052680	She said, well, you keep telling me you should go pro.
1054280	1055400	I see these guys on TV.
1055400	1057320	They aren't hitting holes in one every time they go out.
1057320	1058200	It seems like you do.
1058200	1067320	Uh, she tousles his greasy mop top and kind of wipes her hand off on her nightgown.
1068840	1069640	She's going up to bed.
1069640	1070600	I made some chili.
1070600	1071960	There's some chili in the fridge there.
1071960	1073960	Oh, and uh, somebody left that for you.
1073960	1075720	It's something about an opera.
1075720	1078680	And uh, when Elwood hears this, his heart skips a beat.
1078680	1079080	Yeah.
1079080	1081000	And he turns to his mom.
1081000	1084360	He's walking up the stairs and says, oh, um, thanks mom.
1084360	1087400	Um, hey, uh, Kevin and I, we were thinking of taking a trip.
1087400	1092920	We were, uh, we're going to go to, um, uh, Colorado and hit the, hit the golf courses
1092920	1093240	out there.
1093240	1094360	I heard they're beautiful.
1094360	1096600	We might be, uh, might be gone for a few days.
1097240	1098040	You have a good night.
1099240	1102280	And, uh, Elmira says, oh, uh, okay.
1102280	1103560	You boys have fun out there.
1103560	1104600	Don't get into any trouble.
1105320	1106600	He picks up the envelope.
1106600	1107480	Perfect.
1107480	1107880	Perfect.
1107880	1108280	Perfect.
1110280	1110920	I love that.
1110920	1111160	Okay.
1111160	1113720	Can you give me a quick rundown of what your character looks like?
1113720	1117160	Yeah, he's a greasy and, uh, he's got pimpled and pockmarked face.
1117800	1120280	He's really, uh, super duper skinny.
1120280	1123400	He kind of walks around with his arms folded, but at the wrists.
1124440	1124840	Amazing.
1125400	1130280	And, uh, yeah, he's wearing a ratty sweater vest and a button up with the collar popping
1130280	1131720	at the top, but it all looks wrong.
1131720	1133400	It just looks like it doesn't fit right.
1133400	1135560	Maybe even the buttons are kind of mismatched.
1135560	1141800	One year for Christmas, my grandma got me a sweater vest and it was matching the shirt,
1141800	1144520	the long sleeve dress shirt that would go underneath it.
1144520	1144760	Right.
1145480	1147080	Size on these two.
1147480	1153000	Two items, extra, extra large on the shirt and small on the vest.
1153880	1154280	Perfect.
1154920	1155320	Huh?
1155320	1156120	Did it fit?
1156120	1157320	You know, neither one did.
1159400	1160920	It was wrong both directions.
1162280	1164680	Just mix them together and you'll get the right size.
1164680	1166760	Yeah, it was, it was an interesting look.
1166760	1168600	Very puffy in the arms.
1168600	1168920	All right.
1168920	1170120	Well, Kevin.
1170120	1171240	Yes, of course, please.
1171240	1175880	Kevin, uh, is very large, especially standing next to Elwood.
1175880	1176440	Certainly.
1176440	1178600	He's just shy of seven feet tall.
1179320	1183160	He is hundreds of pounds of, of just muscle.
1183160	1189400	Like it looks like he works out multiple times a day, but like his skin is kind of like yellowish.
1189960	1195000	He's got huge, instead of glasses, they're like, like athletic goggles.
1195000	1199880	Like, you know, they would play in wrapped around his head, makes his eyes look huge.
1199880	1203880	He just still most comfortable wearing those after wearing them for sports.
1203880	1204440	Right.
1204440	1209080	Well, cause he wore them and when he played football and in, in like junior high and high
1209080	1212280	school, pretty much all he did was play football and hang out with Elwood.
1213160	1218600	So it just kind of like became comfortable to him, but you can tell, like, just the way he looks,
1218600	1223000	there's, he's probably got something like genetically wrong with him.
1223000	1225960	Cause he just like never stopped growing and it's huge.
1225960	1229400	And his head is kind of like oddly square.
1229400	1230360	He's an Andre giant.
1231560	1232680	Or an Alton giant.
1232680	1233320	Wadler.
1233400	1236360	Yeah, dude, Robert Wadler guys huge.
1236360	1242920	And he, uh, he was from a town that was pretty near to where I grew up over by St. Louis.
1242920	1243420	Yeah.
1243960	1244840	Huge motherfucker.
1244840	1245480	That guy.
1245480	1250920	But yeah, this guy's huge, uh, yellow long sleeve t-shirt blue, like bib overalls.
1251480	1256520	Uh, those goggles, uh, he's like bald, except for like stealthy bald,
1256520	1261160	except for like three long stringy hairs that he kind of comes over on his head.
1261160	1262440	Oh, okay.
1262440	1264280	So you've been building Homer Simpson.
1265000	1265400	Yeah.
1265400	1265800	Yeah.
1265800	1266520	Homer Simpson.
1267480	1269640	He's large, but quiet.
1269640	1270120	All right.
1270120	1270680	Sick.
1270680	1273880	Uh, it seems to have kind of a soft voice that repeats.
1273880	1274440	Yeah.
1274440	1274920	Boyd's.
1275720	1275960	Yeah.
1275960	1280040	He can form full sentences, but doesn't like to a lot.
1280040	1282280	He likes Elwood speak for him.
1282280	1282600	Okay.
1283800	1285320	And even Elwood isn't that great at it.
1287480	1290440	Well, let's meet someone who should be speaking for the group.
1290680	1290920	Yeah.
1290920	1295800	So as Kevin is daydreaming about his football stardom, his, his five glorious
1295800	1302600	years of high school football of undefeated high school football way, way in the
1302600	1306920	background of that memory behind the throng of cheering fans, you see Clarissa
1306920	1313000	Sparrow, short, serious student body president she's managing a small hot dog
1313000	1316760	stand, the profits from which will benefit a local canine leukemia fund.
1317000	1320040	She gets visibly flustered at the sophomore work in the stand with her, who
1320040	1324200	is chatting with some friends instead of boiling dogs, Clarissa snaps to get his
1324200	1326200	attention and points sharply to station.
1326760	1329240	She glares at his friends and they sheepishly disperse.
1329800	1334840	Clarissa takes a deep sigh and massages her temples and then turns around with a
1334840	1335880	genuine smile.
1336040	1336760	And she asked for Mrs.
1336760	1338040	Elmira Boyd's order.
1338040	1338760	Is there a limit?
1338920	1341640	I just want to support those sick little doggies as much as I can.
1341880	1342680	I'm so sorry.
1342760	1345480	We only have 10 hot and ready at the moment, Mrs.
1345480	1351720	Boyd, we would have more if everyone was doing their duty, come back in a few
1351720	1353480	minutes and we'll have as many as you can carry.
1353480	1354120	I promise.
1354120	1355560	Oh, thank you, Clarissa.
1355560	1356760	You're, you're such a darling.
1356760	1358920	It's so sweet of you to help those pups like this.
1358920	1363400	Kevin's daydream is reaching its moment of climactic triumph over on the field.
1363400	1365320	He's, he's spiking the ball.
1365320	1366680	The crowd's going crazy.
1367240	1369880	And as, as they erupt cheering, his name,
1370120	1373480	Clarissa's head kind of darts over inadvertently towards the field.
1373480	1377480	And the sophomore working with her, it takes that moment to dip away from the
1377480	1380120	stand and disappear into the crowd with his friends.
1381160	1382680	She's more hurt than angry.
1383400	1386120	What makes it so hard for other people to do the right thing?
1386840	1391640	Work hard, follow the rules, do what is expected, stay true to your word, and
1391640	1392520	you'll have a good life.
1393560	1396120	She shakes that thought from her mind and gets back to work.
1396920	1399400	She shakes that thought from her mind and gets back to work.
1400040	1401320	There are hot dogs to move.
1402200	1407320	In the present day, Kevin is snapping out of his daydream as Elmira Boyd offers
1407320	1411720	him and Elwood the chili and mentions the envelope that came for them.
1412680	1417080	Elsewhere in the world that night, Agent Clarissa Sparrow, criminal profiler for
1417080	1420280	the FBI, is coming home to her small one bedroom apartment.
1420840	1424760	She opens the door and finds an identical envelope slipped under it.
1424760	1429640	She's currently dressed in a smart, sensible gray pantsuit, and she has the
1429640	1434040	same smart, sensible haircut she did in Kevin's daydream back in high school.
1434040	1437880	She's staring intensely at the envelope as a cat comes up and rubs her leg in
1437880	1441880	greeting, and she thinks about the way she's tried to live her life since then.
1441880	1446920	Work hard, follow the rules, do what's expected of you, stay true to your word.
1446920	1451240	She never questioned that that was the right path until her first night at the
1451240	1452040	opera.
1452040	1455400	She saw things on that mission that shook her to the core.
1455400	1460040	The minds of hardened veterans cracked apart under supernatural pressures, the
1460040	1465800	bodies of innocents torn apart by unnatural forces, and the lies, bribes, and
1465800	1470920	killings that had taken her and her other agents to conceal the truth that had
1470920	1471560	been unleashed.
1472840	1478040	Her composure, though, distinguished her on that first mission, where more
1478040	1482920	senior agents had lost their minds, she kept it together, and she was soon asked
1482920	1485400	to move from friendly to agent.
1486440	1491720	She draws on that composure now, massaging her temples, taking a deep sigh.
1492440	1495880	She leans down, scratches the cat's ear, and picks up the envelope.
1495880	1498360	Nice, so we've got our three characters.
1498360	1503240	Quick, give me a rundown of what Clarissa looks like, and also what is her last
1503240	1503800	name.
1503800	1504440	Sparrow.
1504440	1506840	Oh, Clarissa Sparrow.
1506840	1507800	I like it.
1508120	1511240	And what does she look like when we see Clarissa?
1511240	1514120	Is she still short, serious, and the student body president?
1514680	1517400	Yes, Clarissa Sparrow.
1517400	1523640	That's kind of a very subtle, very subtle little nod to Clarissa Starling in Silence
1523640	1524120	of the Lambs.
1525240	1527880	And she looks exactly like Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs.
1530680	1533800	Which was playing when I arrived here today.
1533800	1534280	Research.
1534920	1539800	I'd never seen Silence of the Lambs, and while we were setting up, I feel like I kind
1539800	1541400	of watched the whole thing.
1541400	1542440	You saw most of it.
1542440	1543320	Pretty much did, yeah.
1543320	1547800	I saw all the key scenes, I think, that I was like, oh, that's from this.
1547800	1549640	Yeah, it puts the lotion in the basket.
1549640	1550440	Would you fuck me?
1551160	1552360	I'd fuck me.
1552360	1553000	That was pretty cool.
1554760	1555640	That was cool, dude.
1555640	1559080	Yeah, I just want to have that mindset, you know?
1559080	1563160	Like, are you supposed to be jealous of that character?
1563160	1564440	That Wild Bill grindset?
1568520	1569880	Hashtag grindset.
1569880	1575240	These envelopes that have been left for you summon you to a nearby airport and give you
1575240	1578120	access to a private aircraft hangar.
1578120	1584680	And there, you are briefed on this mission by a lone member of the special access group
1584680	1588840	with identification from the National Reconnaissance Office.
1588840	1591800	And he introduces himself as John Smith.
1592360	1595400	You're given file work on the case.
1595400	1601720	And this case involves a former Delta Green agent named Arvin Chilton.
1602280	1606920	And Arvin Chilton was a Delta Green agent for a long time.
1606920	1610920	And then he retired in Ocean City, New Jersey.
1610920	1611960	Well, hmm.
1612520	1618520	Recently, it seems, Arvin Chilton has gone on a bit of a murder spree.
1619400	1622440	His ex-wife is dead.
1622440	1625560	His ex-wife's partner, new husband, is dead.
1626200	1628280	His old partner is dead.
1629480	1633640	There's also a gas station attendant who is dead.
1634280	1641640	Arvin Chilton was seen on camera stabbing this gas station employee in the back and
1641720	1649800	then disemboweling him as a car pulled up and filled their tank of gas not five feet
1649800	1652600	from where this disembowelment was taking place.
1653480	1657240	The person filling up their tank kind of looks around.
1657240	1659160	It looks like they're hearing something.
1659160	1665080	They almost look in the exact direction of Chilton and this dying man.
1665080	1671080	But then the driver just puts the gas pump back in and gets in their car and drives off.
1672600	1675160	That's probably what flagged Delta Green the most.
1677080	1684920	So your three agents are placed on a private aircraft and flown to Woodbine Municipal Airport
1684920	1690120	in Woodbine, New Jersey, which is approximately five miles from Ocean City, New Jersey,
1691000	1694040	as well as the apartment of Arvin Chilton.
1694760	1695400	Excuse me.
1696360	1697800	Is your name Kevin Gelato?
1698520	1699020	Yes.
1699740	1702060	Uh, I don't know if you remember me.
1702620	1703500	Clarissa Sparrow.
1704220	1706860	Agent Clarissa Sparrow, FBI.
1706860	1715820	Kevin kind of looks at her and it cuts to Kevin crying in the bathroom at school and
1715820	1716620	Clarissa like...
1717660	1722620	Clarissa, Clarissa, Clarissa is banging on the door and she's like,
1722620	1724540	I'm sorry, but you need a hall pass.
1725980	1727420	You didn't have a bathroom pass.
1727420	1728780	You need to come out immediately.
1729100	1733180	Kevin comes out and Clarissa like sees he's crying and comforts him.
1733180	1737260	But yeah, she's like patting him on the back while also writing up a little like,
1738380	1739820	writing him up with the other hand.
1739820	1740320	Yeah.
1740780	1745580	It's like, I understand that this is a tough time in our lives where everybody's got some
1745580	1750220	hidden battle they don't see, but it only really takes a couple seconds to get that
1750220	1752540	bathroom pass and the rules are there for a reason.
1753420	1753920	Thank you.
1754880	1758960	And he comes back into reality and...
1760000	1761600	Oh, yeah.
1761600	1762080	Hi.
1762080	1762640	Hey.
1762640	1763280	Hi.
1763280	1764720	What are you doing here?
1764720	1766320	I don't have a bathroom pass.
1768160	1768720	What?
1768720	1770160	You're the hall monitor.
1770160	1771440	I'm with the FBI.
1771440	1775600	I was a hall monitor for all 12 years of my public schooling.
1777360	1778640	You were the football giant.
1779440	1780720	Weren't you going to go pro?
1780720	1782400	Those days are behind him.
1782400	1783280	Jesus Christ.
1784720	1788080	The Elwood turns sideways and you finally see him.
1788080	1791520	Yeah, he leers out from behind the giant.
1792480	1794000	Oh, look, it's a little birdie.
1795840	1798240	Elwood Boyd, smelly Ellie.
1798240	1799280	Good to see you, I guess.
1800000	1801280	How you been?
1801280	1804720	I never, I never wrote up anybody more than you.
1804720	1806400	You sure did seem to have a thing for me.
1806400	1806880	Yeah.
1806880	1808080	I had a thing for justice.
1808880	1809520	I still do.
1810160	1810960	That's why I'm here.
1810960	1811520	What?
1811520	1813120	Why are you two here?
1813120	1813600	Elwood.
1815120	1815760	It's his reason.
1817680	1818880	We're here for a thing.
1820160	1822240	It's opera night.
1822240	1823040	Opera.
1823040	1826960	You two are here for the night at the opera.
1826960	1833440	You can reach in and find what was left for you in this envelope, which was FBI credentials
1833440	1837680	that will not hold up for more than, you know, two or three days.
1837680	1839440	But they'll hold up for a little bit.
1839440	1842800	Yeah, it looks like we're on the same playing field today.
1842800	1848000	Clarissa is now terrified because she has actual FBI credentials.
1848000	1848240	Right.
1848240	1853040	She knows she's going to have, like, if these two fuck up when she's trying to interact
1853040	1858480	with real FBI, it's going to mean everything she's worked for could go down the shitter.
1859040	1861520	Yeah, but hey, they seem on the up and up.
1864960	1871200	It looks like Kevin and I here possess a set of skills that are indispensable for today.
1872160	1873280	What do you make of that?
1873280	1877040	The Delta Green pair, you know, like a character sheet for you.
1877040	1878000	Any kind of overview.
1879040	1880160	What skills would those be?
1883840	1889280	I'm good at getting in the places and I can take things without people seeing that those
1889280	1890080	things got taken.
1891280	1892000	I smash.
1894880	1897120	Okay, so we got a Hulk and a thief.
1898000	1902560	As much as I'm loathe to admit it, those skills might come in handy.
1902560	1905120	I reckon you couldn't get by without us.
1905120	1907200	I reckon I could get by without just about anyone.
1908640	1911040	But here's the deal.
1911040	1916560	If you two have to pass as FBI with me, you're going to keep your mouth shut when we're talking
1916560	1917360	to real FBI.
1918000	1919200	You're not going to embarrass me.
1920000	1923200	You're not going to jeopardize what I do outside of this.
1923200	1927920	In order, I'd say sure, maybe, and we'll see.
1931120	1933680	Thomas doesn't remember what he just proposed to you, so yeah.
1933680	1934640	I was like, what is your...
1936640	1938720	If Elwood likes it, I'll do it.
1938720	1940800	Yeah, I mean, they summoned us.
1940800	1944720	They obviously see that we are needed here and we're going to do what we can.
1945280	1949440	Okay, so she's got your credentials, like the FBI credentials in her hands, and she's
1949440	1951440	like, consider these hall passes.
1952160	1957840	This is a privilege and not a right, and it can be revoked at any moment, and she passes
1957840	1958400	it out to you.
1960080	1960580	Thanks.
1961120	1971520	Once you've landed, the pilot actually pops out from the pirate's cabin, which it says
1971520	1978480	on the door, and he's got a peg leg and a fun three-point hat with the skull and crossbones
1978480	1979120	on it.
1979680	1981280	It's themed chartered airplanes.
1981280	1989520	It's March 25th, which is when this specific company celebrates Halloween, and he says,
1989520	2001120	argh, there's a car outside waiting for ye, and there's a key, a skeleton key that's on
2001120	2001600	the wheel.
2002240	2005440	Thanks for flying our American Airlines.
2005520	2010720	And so there's a car waiting for you guys.
2010720	2011760	What kind of car do you want?
2011760	2012720	A Jaguar.
2012720	2014160	Okay, there's a Jaguar.
2017040	2023440	Okay, there's an old shitty used Jaguar waiting for you guys to the point to where like the
2023440	2026720	mount, like the hood ornament is missing.
2026720	2028960	This is like a beat up old Jag.
2028960	2031040	Can I use my mechanic role too?
2031680	2033120	Which is what we call my uncle.
2036320	2041360	Kevin would know that on this old Jag, the hood ornament actually pops out.
2042640	2045520	So can I do a mechanic role to see if I can get it to pop out?
2045520	2046480	Absolutely you can.
2050640	2051440	It's broken.
2052720	2058640	So you guys see this enormous monstrosity in a yellow shirt and blue overalls and these
2058640	2064240	big thick goggles and three strands of hair walk over to this car and kind of.
2064240	2069040	Kind of touching where the hood ornament should be and he like pokes it, but his finger
2069040	2070720	just goes down into the metal.
2071360	2076880	He poked it way too hard and he like completely destroys where it would pop out.
2076880	2078880	Just like pressing aluminum foil.
2078880	2082320	Yeah, like crushing a little tin little coke can.
2083440	2089040	Kevin gets in the passenger seat of the car and the car just like almost touches the ground
2089040	2090560	with him in it.
2090560	2099600	As you guys head off to the Ocean City Police Department, it's currently March 25th, 2016.
2099600	2104560	The first murder happened on March 21st, so that was four days ago.
2104560	2110240	It is strange that there's some reason that he looked right directly at it happening and
2110240	2111760	he didn't do anything about it.
2111760	2112260	Nothing.
2112720	2114000	You think maybe he was scared?
2114640	2115140	Yeah.
2116160	2117280	Do you think that?
2117280	2122480	Perhaps there was some sort of optical refraction in the way.
2122480	2125280	Some natural phenomenon we can't really see getting in the way.
2125280	2127040	Maybe some kind of glare on the window.
2127920	2131760	Elwood, you've been reading those magic books.
2131760	2132800	I don't like.
2132800	2133300	Maybe.
2134480	2136160	Is there something like that?
2137520	2141520	There is nothing in Penn and Teller's How to Do Magic to prepare me for this.
2141520	2142020	No.
2143120	2144400	Yeah, I never liked.
2144400	2146240	It's always made me scared.
2146240	2147280	I love Penn and Teller.
2147280	2148640	They are good, aren't they?
2148640	2149360	They're serious.
2150320	2152640	He pulled a card out of my ear.
2152640	2154000	I couldn't feel it in there.
2157280	2158960	Maybe he's a magician.
2160160	2162160	I guess maybe some kind of sleight of hand.
2162160	2163040	He distracted him.
2163680	2166800	He maybe waved his hand in the air and that's what the guy looked at and then.
2167680	2171120	And maybe we didn't see that happen because it worked on us too.
2171680	2173600	Is this your first night at the opera?
2173600	2175920	No, I've done a couple.
2176480	2182400	You ever see anything on either of those nights that might be explained by close-up magic?
2183520	2187600	You think you get one of those envelopes when Penn and Teller are loose?
2189200	2192560	Well, it says here he was a Delta Green agent.
2192560	2196560	I assume that they just want us to make sure that all the T's are dotted and the I's are crossed.
2199520	2200720	Cross your I's.
2200800	2204160	If he's a magician, he's bad.
2205360	2208320	He does seem to leave a trail of bodies everywhere he goes.
2208320	2210800	That's not something that Penn and Teller do as far as I know.
2210800	2214720	Agent Clarissa puts in some headphones and starts reviewing the files herself.
2217360	2221200	The Ocean City Police Station is buzzing.
2221200	2224480	It is an extremely busy day here.
2224480	2226080	People are running around.
2226560	2232640	It's around 11 30 a.m. on March 25, 2016.
2232640	2236480	Someone greets you at the counter as the three of you arrive.
2239040	2240400	Hell yes, hi.
2240400	2243040	Special Agent Clarissa Sparrow, FBI.
2243920	2246960	These are my partners on this particular task force.
2246960	2247840	She slaps.
2247840	2249120	Luke is waving.
2250480	2251920	Kevin starts waving really good.
2251920	2255680	And Clarissa without even looking just slaps his hand down behind her.
2256480	2259840	Elwitt's kind of in the back legs kind of cross looking at the floor.
2259840	2264000	Quinlan and Gambeson are still at lunch, but you can talk to Garza.
2264000	2265520	Agent Garza from the FBI.
2266240	2268480	Sorry, he's in the first conference room.
2268480	2269680	That's where we have him set up.
2269680	2270080	Thank you.
2270080	2270800	And she points.
2271440	2276800	And you see an extremely large man, massively obese in his mid 60s.
2276800	2280480	He has a graying comb over and a gray suit.
2280480	2287040	He's wearing a red tie and you see red suspenders are poking out from his suit jacket,
2287040	2290480	which will not even get close to closing,
2290480	2295520	like to the point to where you can see both suspenders in full visibility.
2296080	2299200	And he's just om-nomming a grinder.
2299200	2300960	He is just going to town.
2300960	2304960	He's just like, oh, come in, come in, come on in.
2305840	2306720	Sit down.
2306800	2307520	You're the FBI?
2310480	2314000	Sorry, I got to get through this lunch while we're going, if that's cool.
2314000	2315920	I'm just going to eat while I talk.
2315920	2316480	Is that good?
2316480	2317120	You like that?
2317120	2319200	Elwitt, do you want him to eat while we talk?
2320640	2321140	Sure.
2321440	2321760	Good.
2321760	2322260	Yeah.
2322960	2327920	He goes, stands up, goes to shake your hand and he's got mayo like all over his fingers.
2327920	2328880	And he's like, oh shit.
2328880	2334720	And he rubs it just immediately on his jacket and then reaches his hand back out and says,
2334720	2337680	Agent Garza, but everybody calls me Uncle Jimmy.
2337680	2341440	Clarissa nods curtly, does not extend her hand and says,
2342160	2345600	Agent Clarissa Sparrow, priest to meet you, Agent Garza.
2345600	2346100	Sparrow.
2346960	2347600	All right.
2347600	2348080	Sounds good.
2348080	2348720	Agent Boyd.
2349360	2351120	And I firmly grabbed his hand.
2351120	2355600	And when I pull it away, I do a quick lick of my hand.
2355600	2356100	Jesus.
2356800	2359360	Whoa, did you get some of my sandwich in there?
2359360	2360640	Some of the mayonnaise was on there.
2360640	2361280	It's fine.
2361280	2362160	Okay.
2362160	2362560	All right.
2362640	2363140	Hi.
2363760	2364000	Wow.
2364000	2365120	You're a big fella, aren't you?
2365760	2366480	Did you play a game?
2367360	2368880	Those days are behind him though.
2368880	2371040	I still like to think about it.
2371040	2373760	I mean, you look like you could go pro any second.
2373760	2374800	I could have.
2374800	2375840	What happened?
2375840	2377200	Elwitt told me not to.
2377200	2378800	He decided not to.
2378800	2380720	Yeah, I decided not to.
2380720	2382560	Well, let's get down to brass tacks here.
2382560	2385680	And he slams pictures down on the desk in front of you.
2385680	2392240	Also, quick shout out to Dylan B from Deadwood, South Dakota for the NPC
2392240	2393440	Uncle Jimmy.
2393440	2395440	That one is just the TV show.
2397280	2401760	And Dylan B is a patron at at least our $10 level.
2401760	2406160	So he gets to create an NPC and a location that might get used.
2406160	2406960	An empuk.
2406960	2407680	An empuk.
2407680	2409200	And this is an empuk.
2409200	2414640	And so we've got this jovial man who insists that everyone call him uncle,
2414640	2418080	who is out of breath and sweating with any movement.
2418080	2418580	Nice.
2419280	2420320	All right, let's get down.
2420640	2422960	And he slams these pictures down on the table.
2422960	2426880	And it is horribly disturbing crime scene photos.
2426880	2428560	So everyone roll sanity for me.
2429360	2429860	Pass.
2431040	2433760	I also pass a 29 on a 45.
2433760	2435600	I got a 14 on a 45.
2435600	2437600	72 on an 80.
2437600	2438160	Oh, wow.
2438160	2439760	Okay, so everyone 80.
2439760	2440160	Jesus.
2440160	2441760	So everyone passes.
2441760	2443760	You are going to lose no sanity.
2443760	2445200	You've all seen stuff like this.
2445280	2447680	And he looks up at your faces.
2447680	2452320	And then he looks back down at these bloody violent pictures
2452320	2456160	where this normal home has been completely torn up.
2456160	2461680	And the two victims are missing their eyes and tongues.
2462240	2467120	Blood is covering the faces and splattering the ground behind them.
2467120	2472160	And the woman, Eileen McCarty, the ex-wife of Arvin Chilton,
2472160	2476400	is basically it's impossible to tell who she is.
2476400	2480640	And even her husband, it's impossible to really make out their faces,
2480640	2484640	because without an eyes and with all this blood covering bruises,
2484640	2489520	without eyes, without eyes, it's going to be hard to recognize these folks.
2489520	2490640	And he slams down.
2490640	2491360	He goes down.
2491360	2493200	You see anything crazy out of the ordinary?
2493200	2495120	You looked at all this information.
2495120	2498160	You saw there's no sign of forced entry.
2498160	2501680	Clearly, a neighbor even saw the husband and wife
2501680	2503840	let this ex-husband into their house.
2504480	2505760	You saw the weapon.
2505760	2508560	It was this large hook knife, I guess.
2509120	2513200	But me personally, if you're asking me, which you are,
2513840	2516240	I don't think that that body...
2516240	2519600	And he points at this just destroyed face.
2519600	2522400	I don't think that that's Eileen McCarty.
2524000	2526800	What reason do you have to believe that that's not Eileen McCarty?
2526800	2536320	Eileen McCarty was seen by witnesses in New York state on March 23rd at a gas station.
2537040	2539040	When was this picture taken?
2539040	2540320	That was March 21st.
2540320	2541440	That was the day of the murder.
2542160	2545360	Medical examiner said, you know, torture, death.
2545920	2550320	The torture was prolonged, extremely violent, obviously.
2550320	2553840	And he taps really hard and gets mayonnaise all over the pictures
2553840	2555120	that he's put out on this desk.
2557040	2557920	But I'm not worried.
2557920	2558480	I'm not worried.
2558480	2559120	You guys are here.
2559120	2560800	You guys are here to take care of everything.
2560800	2563280	And I understand that we needed reinforcements on this thing.
2563280	2564560	It's already been three days.
2564560	2565920	Everything's up in the air right now.
2565920	2568320	Everyone's pretty fucking confused.
2568320	2572560	But I think one of three things is going to happen.
2572560	2575520	He's either going to use his credit card, which we've tagged.
2575520	2579280	He's going to get pulled over or ticketed in a known car.
2579280	2583280	Or he's just going to overplay his hand in some other way.
2583280	2585680	He's going to make a mistake and then we'll get him.
2585680	2586640	He's a desperate man.
2587440	2589680	Desperate man make desperate moves.
2590640	2594080	And that allows for reasonable people to catch him.
2595360	2597520	Is the footage from the gas station,
2597520	2600400	is that his last known appearance for us?
2600400	2601200	Yeah.
2601200	2601440	Yeah.
2601440	2603520	It's the last time we saw him.
2603520	2609200	Also, that gas station, I think, and he like picks around at some of his notes.
2609200	2613760	He's like, yeah, actually that gas station is where?
2613760	2614480	Eileen.
2615040	2618400	Eileen McCarty was seen the same day of that murder.
2619120	2620240	She was seen there.
2620240	2622480	Eileen McCarty was seen at the same gas station
2622480	2624720	where that attendant was brutally murdered by.
2624720	2625040	Yeah.
2625040	2627120	And two days after she supposedly died.
2627120	2628400	According to what witnesses?
2628400	2629440	Multiple witnesses.
2630720	2631280	Who?
2631280	2631840	Multiple.
2635680	2637520	Is that all you, Zach Note?
2637520	2638960	Multiple witnesses.
2640320	2641200	What do you want to know?
2641200	2644240	What do you want to know if they're like smart, if they could see?
2644880	2650560	I want to know why people in not her state at a gas station could identify her.
2650560	2652320	We were showing photos.
2652320	2656720	Have we identified the person on that footage that pulled up to the gas station?
2656720	2658240	No, the one who left, no.
2658240	2661360	But we did identify the guy who died.
2662000	2664800	His name was Quentin Harris, who's 59.
2664800	2667920	Do you think the guy in the car that drove off did it?
2667920	2669680	Well, no.
2669680	2670240	No.
2670240	2672480	Cause it's on tape.
2672480	2673360	It's Arvin Chilton.
2673440	2674080	You saw it.
2675040	2675360	Yeah.
2676000	2676880	Okay.
2676880	2677200	Yeah.
2677200	2678000	You saw that, right?
2678560	2679280	Yeah.
2679280	2680240	Do you want to watch it again?
2681120	2683120	No, he's well aware.
2683120	2684080	He's testing you.
2684080	2687040	He's got an interesting investigative mind.
2687040	2692400	But why don't you save the mind games for Kevin is extremely confused, but just nods
2692400	2693520	his head and agrees.
2695360	2698960	Was Eileen McCarty seen at the gas station before or after the murder?
2698960	2699840	Before.
2699840	2700640	How long before?
2701360	2703200	He picks through a couple more notes.
2703200	2708960	Mayo is just spreading throughout, slowly getting on everything.
2708960	2715200	If any of those drops kind of come near Elwood, he's wiping a finger up and tasting it.
2715200	2722000	Oh, uncle Jimmy looks over at Clarissa and is just like, how long have you three been
2722000	2722720	working together?
2723280	2724960	This partnership is very recent.
2724960	2725460	Hmm.
2726400	2727360	I'm sorry.
2727360	2729120	He's been my friend a long time.
2729120	2730400	Yeah, I get that.
2730400	2731760	I see that in the two of you.
2731760	2732400	All right.
2732400	2735520	So, yeah, if you want any phone records, there's really not much there.
2735520	2738400	We've got it tracked and an alert is set on it.
2738400	2742640	So if he makes any phone calls, we're going to know about it.
2742640	2744320	And I think that's how we're going to get him.
2745440	2747520	Nothing out of sorts.
2747520	2751680	He did call Eileen on the morning of March 16th.
2751680	2754480	So that's five days pre death.
2755280	2757760	Supposed death of Eileen McCarty.
2757760	2759760	Did we try just calling him?
2759760	2760160	Yeah.
2760160	2760960	What happened?
2760960	2761920	He didn't pick up.
2761920	2762880	Can I try?
2762880	2764400	No, I mean, sure.
2764400	2765360	You can if you want.
2765360	2766080	I don't care.
2766080	2766400	Yes.
2766400	2767680	I dialed the phone number.
2768720	2769360	Okay.
2769360	2772400	Did you learn about that March 16th call from phone records?
2772400	2772880	Yeah.
2772880	2775520	How long did they indicate that that phone call lasted?
2775520	2777520	Two minutes, one second.
2777520	2778880	71 seconds.
2778880	2780560	Oh, 71 is wrong.
2780560	2781060	Huh.
2781520	2782960	121.
2782960	2785760	No, math was never my strong suit.
2785760	2787920	Uncle Jimmy's good at a lot of stuff.
2787920	2788720	Math ain't it?
2788720	2789220	Ha.
2789620	2794660	Did you have many nieces and nephews, Agent Garza?
2795220	2797620	Yeah, four.
2797620	2798660	What are their full names?
2798660	2799220	What do they do?
2800420	2803060	Where were they on March 23rd?
2803700	2804200	Why?
2804740	2806580	Anything that can help.
2806580	2807060	It's weird.
2807060	2807540	Didn't you say?
2807540	2810420	We've also got credit card tracking info.
2810420	2815380	It's completely normal until March 20th, day before the first murder.
2815380	2818020	Becomes irregular and then ceases.
2818820	2819940	What does that mean?
2819940	2822260	Yeah, it got weird and then stopped.
2822260	2823060	Like what?
2823060	2828180	Yeah, basically he was clearly using the card not in Ocean City.
2828180	2834020	The card was being used up toward New York and then it just stops.
2834020	2838420	So it's clear that he used it, then committed the murder, hasn't used it since.
2838420	2839860	And what was his last call?
2841540	2842020	Let's see.
2842660	2843940	Go to the last page.
2843940	2845300	Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip.
2846180	2849380	Yeah, it goes to Alexander Duchesne.
2850340	2851780	What do we know about him?
2851780	2853380	He's the landlord.
2854020	2854980	Of Chilton?
2854980	2857060	Yeah, he's Arvin Chilton's landlord.
2857060	2858980	Alexander Duchesne, old guy.
2858980	2860180	How long did that call last?
2860900	2867060	That call was 29 seconds or zero minutes and 29 seconds.
2867060	2868820	Have we talked to him?
2868820	2869860	Quick math.
2869860	2871140	Have we talked to Duchesne?
2871140	2872660	Yeah, we've talked to Duchesne.
2872660	2873620	What did he say?
2873620	2874980	Talked to him on the 23rd.
2875860	2879220	He said that Arvin's been living with him for five years.
2879220	2880740	Arvin lives upstairs.
2881460	2886420	It's like one of those houses where just the upstairs is an apartment.
2886420	2890660	It's got an external doorway, stairs on the outside.
2891300	2895060	Gone up there into Arvin's apartment, but downstairs is where the old man lives.
2895700	2896420	I don't know, man.
2896420	2897380	Seems like a shut-in.
2898180	2902580	When Eileen was at that gas station, was that the Quinlan on duty at that time?
2902580	2904500	Does she have contact with Quinlan?
2904500	2906340	Uh, yeah, let's look.
2906340	2909940	And he'll flip through some video and...
2913220	2913860	Oh, no.
2915940	2916660	Oh, wow.
2916660	2917140	Yeah, no.
2918100	2920580	All the inside tapes must have gotten taken.
2921220	2922020	Bye.
2922020	2923380	That's really weird.
2923380	2924100	Who took him?
2925220	2928740	No, I mean, like, we never got him and he's flipping through and he's looking.
2928740	2929940	Yeah, they were never checked in.
2929940	2932740	Clarissa gives a little cough and she says,
2932740	2935380	Can I speak with my associates in the hallway for one moment?
2935380	2940180	Yeah, actually, I'm really busy here as he, like, finishes this huge sandwich.
2940180	2943620	There's a third of it left and he just shoves the entire thing in his mouth.
2943620	2946180	And he's like, I'll wrap up here.
2946180	2951220	And so if you guys want to head over to Chilton's and just kind of get lay of the land,
2952100	2957860	I'm sure you can talk to, uh, when, uh, uh, what are their names?
2957940	2960980	Quinlan and Gambeson, the PDs around here.
2962100	2964740	They'll be back after lunch and you can talk to them.
2965300	2968260	But yeah, go ahead and just head on out and we'll talk.
2968260	2969780	We'll catch up later if you want.
2969780	2971380	But he has seen the video.
2971380	2971780	He has.
2972340	2973700	He's very confused by it.
2973700	2975060	It doesn't make any sense to him.
2975060	2976660	And so that's all.
2976660	2979220	He passed his sanity check and he's like,
2980180	2980980	Yeah, I don't know.
2980980	2981780	People are strange.
2981780	2984260	The guy probably didn't want to be caught up in anything.
2984260	2985620	Just needed to get away.
2985620	2987220	You know, the bystander effect.
2987220	2989700	He honestly probably had a little pot on him.
2989700	2992020	You know, a lot of them do.
2992020	2992820	Yeah.
2992820	2993940	Bystanders.
2993940	2994580	Yeah.
2994580	2997380	Bystanders typically more like high standards.
2997380	2998180	Am I right?
2998180	2999700	That's very funny, Agent Garza.
2999700	3000180	Thank you.
3000180	3002260	Uh, Uncle Jimmy, you can call me Uncle Jimmy.
3004020	3006900	This was, um, thank you for your assistance, Agent Garza.
3006900	3007860	Thanks for coming.
3007860	3008260	All right.
3008260	3008980	Uh, yeah.
3008980	3010020	Holler if you need anything.
3010020	3011140	Here's my phone number.
3011140	3012420	Here's my card.
3012420	3014340	I'll be here or I'll be elsewhere.
3015220	3016580	Isn't that how it always goes?
3016580	3017780	Where are you guys staying?
3017780	3018820	You have a pleasant evening.
3018820	3019140	Okay.
3021220	3023380	When you guys pull up to Arvin Chilton's apartment,
3023380	3027860	it is literally half a mile from the police station.
3027860	3029620	This neighborhood is really nice.
3029620	3033380	It's just this like March 20, what is it?
3033380	3034180	March 25th.
3034180	3034820	Shit.
3034820	3035620	March 25th.
3035620	3037780	It's a beautiful sunny day.
3038500	3043540	Big fluffers are up in the clouds and blue skies.
3043540	3048420	All of these buildings have like white trim on the columns
3048420	3052980	and the stairwells and the, the, uh, what are these Thomas?
3052980	3053860	Braillings.
3053860	3054740	Like a railing.
3054740	3055060	Yeah.
3055060	3057380	Like railings are all, uh, white.
3057380	3059860	You pull up to a cute little baby blue home.
3059860	3061140	It's two stories.
3061140	3067380	And like Uncle Jimmy said, there is a staircase on the left side of this house
3067380	3073860	that leads up to a tiny little duplex up above this tiny little home.
3074580	3078500	And you guys pull up at about 1230 PM.
3079060	3080420	It's about 1230 PM.
3082500	3084340	We've just arrived at the home of...
3084340	3087300	Are you like talking into a voice recorder?
3087300	3090180	Are you, uh, are you going to be taking notes this whole time?
3090820	3093460	Does that make you uncomfortable, Mr. Boyd?
3093460	3096900	I feel like we need to be careful about what kind of records we keep on
3096900	3097780	a case like this.
3097780	3098980	Yeah, we need to be careful.
3100100	3101140	You're absolutely right.
3101140	3107460	But I have to keep some official records since we are technically investigating this for the FBI.
3107460	3109620	There has to be the official cover and then...
3109620	3112180	And then every now and then it switches off.
3112180	3113060	Wink, wink.
3113060	3114580	You roughly get the idea.
3114580	3115140	Yeah.
3115140	3120260	Kevin walks up the stairs and knocks on the door and it like shakes the home.
3120260	3124420	With every step of these shaky old stairs,
3124420	3127940	this thing is like almost giving way under Kevin.
3128580	3131060	And when you get up there, you see a sign on the door.
3131060	3131860	Taped up.
3131860	3135060	Police investigation ongoing.
3135060	3136180	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3136180	3136900	Nonsense.
3136900	3140100	Agent Garza gave you keys to children's apartment.
3140100	3140740	What's going on?
3140740	3144500	And there is a light on in the downstairs apartment.
3144500	3150100	Yeah, Kevin's hands are a little too big to really functionally use a key.
3150100	3151380	So he steps back and...
3151780	3158020	Sorry, I had you be a thief and then I gave you keys to get in.
3158020	3158900	That's my bad, Joe.
3159780	3161780	Yeah, that was the only time this was going to come in handy.
3163380	3166260	He was pulling out the lockpick set from his back pocket and then saw
3167300	3171060	Agent Sparrows put a key in the door and it just deflates even more.
3173460	3176500	I guess we're still waiting for that skill set to come in use.
3176500	3178180	There will be a time, I'm sure of it.
3178260	3183940	Perhaps this whole mission will be the time that you learn that your criminal ways will not pay.
3184580	3187940	I mean, they paid for most of the things in my life so far.
3188980	3190260	They paid pretty good.
3190260	3194340	She turns on you and is brandishing the key in your face and she's like,
3194980	3198420	no, sir, you will receive your come up,
3198420	3202340	but I'm willing to work with your kind against these unnatural forces.
3202340	3203860	Don't do that to him.
3203860	3209620	And Kevin's standing there like pushing away the threatening key from Elvit's face.
3210580	3213060	All right then, as long as we understand each other and
3213940	3219140	Clarissa is genuinely very intimidated by the Robert Wadlow man.
3220580	3222020	Yeah, who wouldn't be?
3222020	3222740	Are you okay?
3224260	3225620	Thanks for having my back there, Kevin.
3226420	3226900	I'm fine.
3226900	3227700	Thank you.
3227700	3229460	I was a little worried.
3229460	3233620	It's a 640 square foot apartment.
3233620	3236740	This looks like about a 640 square feet.
3237620	3240740	Right here must be tens of dollars.
3240740	3242180	So you walk into the bedroom.
3242180	3245060	Like when you open up the door, you're walking into the studio.
3245060	3249860	It's a bedroom and there's one door to the bathroom all around.
3249860	3251220	There's a record collection.
3251220	3253220	There's a bunch of Elvis Presley.
3253220	3257940	There's a bookshelf filled with the works of the immortal bard himself, William Shakespeare,
3258660	3266100	as well as a DVD collection that shows he did not shy away from the film adaptations.
3266100	3268820	And there's really not much else around here.
3268820	3271780	So he's got like these Shakespeares and some books
3271780	3275300	and then also DVD copies of just those same plays and books.
3276180	3278340	Is there a computer anywhere near here?
3278340	3280100	There is not a computer, no.
3280100	3281620	Well, it looks like there's nothing to see here.
3281620	3282900	Let's move on to the next place.
3283460	3285540	Everybody roll alertness for me.
3288340	3289540	Critical success.
3289540	3290740	55 on an 80.
3290740	3291940	A regular success.
3291940	3293380	A 30 on a 70.
3293380	3294740	I got a 97.
3294740	3295140	Okay.
3295140	3297620	So Kevin is completely startled.
3298340	3304820	Boyd, Elwood, Elwood Boyd is not startled.
3304820	3312420	You see this coming, but before you even see anyone creeping up behind you
3312420	3316260	and kind of like putting themselves around the doorway,
3316900	3324740	Clarissa, you smell old bandages in the air.
3326260	3332740	The odor is strong enough for you to immediately turn around.
3332740	3334820	She turns around and expects to find a mummy.
3336740	3340180	Expecting a mummy, you see Alexander Duchesne.
3340180	3343220	He is 79 years of age.
3343220	3347780	He is around five foot six, 210 pounds.
3347780	3348740	An old man.
3348740	3354340	He has carefully quaffed white hair and he has heavy black glasses.
3354340	3360900	He is clothed in old often mended clothing and a pork pie hat.
3361860	3368900	And he has a long winding scar up the right half of his face.
3368900	3375940	It's clear that he drinks due to the large nose with burst capillaries,
3375940	3382500	just filling this big, almost like pulsating thing on the tip of his nose.
3382500	3386260	And he moves slowly, seemingly with great pain,
3386260	3389380	as he kind of like pops his head around the side and is like,
3392820	3394020	More officers.
3394900	3396500	Hello, more officers.
3396900	3397700	Hello, there.
3397700	3402020	Before he can, he's like coming up the stairs into the doorway behind us.
3402020	3402980	Yeah, he's right there.
3402980	3407060	Before he can like get in, Clarissa is advancing like with her badge out and she says,
3407060	3412020	Special Agent Clarissa Sparrow, sir, this is an act of crime scene investigation.
3412020	3414020	You were compromising that crime scene.
3414020	3415300	Are you Mr. Duchesne?
3415300	3418100	Oh, I'm so sorry, yeah, yeah, I'm Mr. Duchesne.
3418100	3419860	I'm going to have to ask you to go back downstairs.
3419860	3423940	Slowly, he raises his hands in the air with a wry smile and he's like,
3424900	3426340	Sorry, sorry.
3427540	3429860	Sir, we're going to come speak to you in a moment, please.
3429860	3431140	Okay, please do, come on.
3431140	3432260	Please wait for us downstairs.
3432260	3433060	Whenever you're ready.
3433060	3433700	Yes, fine.
3433700	3434180	That's fine.
3434180	3439220	And he slowly creeps back around and like you can almost hear his bones creaking
3439860	3444500	with the pain look on his face as he turns around and it's like, okay.
3444500	3450900	And just kind of waves one hand up in the air as his other hand grabs the rail like intensely.
3450900	3452340	Kevin waves back at him.
3452340	3453780	And he heads back down the stairs.
3454020	3454520	Really?
3455540	3456980	That was a landlord.
3456980	3461620	Elwood wants to, um, clock this apartment for things that, uh, might be valuable.
3461620	3462020	Oh, okay.
3462020	3462420	Yeah, yeah.
3462420	3465380	Go ahead and roll search for criminology.
3466100	3466900	Yeah, absolutely.
3467540	3468500	This is what you guys do.
3469540	3470180	Fuck.
3470180	3472820	I critically fail either one.
3472820	3476260	I've got a 60 criminology and I rolled a 77.
3476260	3482900	There's a Shakespeare play inside the book has a pamphlet.
3482900	3486260	Like you would receive when you went and actually saw a play.
3486260	3487140	What are those called?
3487140	3487860	A play bill.
3487860	3488500	Play bill.
3488500	3489620	A play bill.
3489620	3495780	When you, when you flick through some of these, these books, this play bill pops out and you
3495780	3503860	are dead fucking certain that a, this is from an early original, like one of the first American
3503860	3506180	runs of this Shakespeare production.
3506180	3507860	This is a globe theater play bill.
3507860	3516660	And it's like signed by some important director who signed by John Wilkes Booth.
3516660	3518980	It's signed by John Wilkes Booth.
3518980	3520340	Wasn't his brother an actor?
3520980	3524660	I think as was, he was a very famous actor.
3524660	3530180	And so you are dead fucking positive that this is going to bring in at least like 10
3530180	3530740	grand.
3530740	3532020	I pocket it.
3532020	3534100	I try to do it feefully.
3534100	3534980	Oh, you don't.
3534980	3535940	They both see you.
3536820	3538340	Oh, I see you get that.
3538340	3543540	And I just like grab a random book and put it in my back pocket.
3545380	3545940	What the hell?
3545940	3546420	What?
3546420	3548660	What are you grabbing evidence for?
3548660	3550420	It's signed by John Wilkes Booth.
3550420	3552100	This gets a pretty penny.
3552100	3554340	I grab it from her hands.
3556740	3560580	All right, let's do a dexterity competition.
3562100	3563300	No, you're not in this.
3563300	3563940	Crit fail.
3563940	3565140	Oh my God.
3565140	3566340	Regular fail.
3566340	3569620	All right, well, that still means that we rip the book in half.
3569620	3571780	Yeah, you 100% rip the book in half.
3574020	3576100	Oh, no, I thought at least it's all its value.
3576100	3578020	Oh God, you did this.
3578740	3579380	You did this.
3579940	3583620	A little tear starts to form at the edge of Kevin's eye.
3583620	3584980	Damn it, Kevin.
3584980	3586020	It wasn't your fault.
3586020	3586660	He did this.
3587780	3588260	He start.
3590020	3592580	You two, you keep your hands to yourself.
3593380	3594740	Stand right in the middle of this room.
3595460	3596340	Don't touch anything else.
3596340	3599380	Elwood kind of rolls his eyes, but also looks at Kevin like,
3600340	3602020	that sounds like she knows what she's doing.
3603060	3607940	Now let me use my investigators eyes to search this room.
3607940	3608660	Do it.
3608660	3610180	35, success.
3610180	3610740	Nice.
3610740	3614500	You find there's a record collection with a bunch of Elvis Presley.
3614500	3620340	There's a bookshelf filled with the works of the immortal bard himself, William Shakespeare,
3620340	3622580	one of which is torn in half on the floor.
3623300	3628980	And you also see a DVD collection that shows he did not shy away from the film adaptations.
3631700	3634180	Everything appears to be as it seems in this room.
3634180	3635940	Should we go rough up the landlord?
3638580	3641860	If it comes to that, of course, Kevin, that just can't be our immediate.
3641860	3643540	We're on official business here.
3643540	3646900	And he says that kind of sarcastically with an eye toward Sparrow.
3646900	3649620	Sparrow doesn't catch that and she like nods in approval.
3650260	3650740	That's right.
3652900	3653220	Okay.
3653220	3654820	I'll put my mean face on.
3655540	3660900	And his face turns mean, but it actually is like kind of scary.
3660900	3667540	Like the happy, dumb smile goes to like a serious, like zoned in face and idea roll.
3667540	3668100	Yeah.
3668100	3670180	For some, for anything we might be missing here.
3670180	3671060	Yeah, sure.
3671060	3675300	What is that based off of intelligence pass 62 on a 70.
3675300	3677060	You have cleaned this room.
3677060	3679140	Like it is, it has been clocked.
3679140	3683780	You have garnered all the information you are going to get from Arvin Chilton's apartment.
3683780	3685780	I believe we've gathered everything we can here.
3685780	3687540	Let's go at this time.
3688260	3691060	Let's go talk with Mr. Dushane.
3691060	3693620	That does seem like the next course of action.
3693620	3694340	After you.
3694340	3696100	No, no, I insist after you.
3696100	3697940	I start clomping down the stairs.
3697940	3702100	As you're clomping down the stairs, you actually hear coming out of the basement,
3702100	3706980	not even basement, just the first floor apartment of this two story duplex.
3707540	3710260	This, uh, this high wine.
3720580	3721540	Is he making us tea?
3721540	3722740	Yeah, he's making you tea.
3722740	3723220	That's nice.
3726260	3732740	Okay, the entire house shakes and you hear a coughing fit from inside.
3732740	3745220	Just this coming, coming, coming, and the door opens and you see this man.
3745220	3746580	It's the same man as before.
3747540	3749460	And he's, he's wearing the same clothes.
3750260	3751380	It's crazy.
3751380	3755060	And this close to him, you're overwhelmed by his odor.
3755060	3756660	He smells really bad.
3756660	3761860	And for the two of you who didn't smell it earlier, it's like old bandages bad.
3761940	3763380	And he seems to have a cold.
3763380	3766420	He's like coughing and he's just like sniffling a bunch.
3766420	3768820	He invites you inside really eagerly.
3768820	3770580	He's just like, come on, come on, come on, come on.
3770580	3770900	Okay.
3770900	3772580	Um, I have tea.
3772580	3774260	I have tea for you guys.
3774260	3777140	If you want tea, um, I've put out some, some plates.
3777140	3777940	I've got some more food.
3777940	3778740	Here's some chairs.
3778740	3780340	You can sit here and here.
3780340	3782900	Um, your, your name was Sparrow, right?
3782900	3783460	Agent Sparrow.
3784980	3786660	I pass him my FBI card.
3786660	3787060	Perfect.
3787060	3788340	And do you guys have cards too?
3788980	3790420	No, they're just getting theirs made up.
3790420	3791060	Unfortunately.
3791060	3792020	Oh, okay.
3796340	3797140	Sorry.
3797140	3797640	Sorry.
3798740	3800020	I'll wash my hands real quick.
3800020	3802100	He goes back and starts washing his hands.
3802100	3809220	And you see, uh, looking around this place, you see a very sad home decorated by an old
3809220	3811060	man with no relatives.
3811060	3815860	There's an ashtray on the table and it hasn't been used.
3815860	3816820	It's clean.
3816820	3819460	There's a bunch of rolled up newspapers in a bucket.
3819940	3822740	A few mops are in the corner of the room strangely.
3822740	3826100	And there's an odd number of baseballs placed around.
3826100	3835060	There's a copy of as you like it sitting on the coffee table and he brings out a spread.
3835060	3841460	I mean, just like a charcutte, but like the way a 79 year old shut in would, would bring
3841460	3842580	you charcutte.
3842580	3845620	And so it's just these like charcutte cold cuts.
3846180	3848100	Oh, it's charcutte as hell.
3848100	3850260	The charcutte is good.
3850260	3853780	It's cold cuts and some cheeses.
3853780	3860660	And then there's a bowl on the plate with some big olives on it, green and black olives.
3860660	3869460	And he sits down and he's just like, I'm sorry, he screams as he eases into a chair that you
3869460	3871860	think is like the only place where he sits.
3872740	3877380	Elwood wants to put a grimy finger into the olive bowl and pick up a bunch.
3877380	3879060	Like as he's setting it down.
3879060	3879940	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
3879940	3880500	He's already.
3881220	3881940	Oh yeah, yeah.
3881940	3884020	Please, please eat up, eat up.
3884020	3888260	Pretty sure I know what kind of maniac Joe took before this game started.
3888260	3888500	Yeah.
3888500	3894020	As soon as Kevin sees Elwood doing that, he's grabbing some stuff off the board, but it's
3894020	3897380	like one handful is like half of the stuff on there.
3897380	3899860	And he's just like, dig in, dig in.
3900660	3902500	Agent Sparrow, dig in.
3902500	3904420	I'm going to grab some tea for everyone.
3904420	3906980	And he goes in and no tea for me, please.
3907300	3908340	Chocolate milk.
3908340	3909460	I do.
3909460	3911460	I love chocolate milk.
3911460	3913700	Who doesn't love chocolate milk?
3913700	3914980	Just make that too.
3914980	3915700	Thank you.
3915700	3917060	Two chocolate milks.
3917060	3920260	And you hear him rummaging in the fridge for a while.
3920260	3921060	Can I do a search?
3922180	3925060	Can someone else do a search of this room?
3925060	3926260	I'd like to clock.
3926260	3927700	I'd like to clock around the room.
3927700	3928180	Yeah.
3928180	3929700	Oh, crit success.
3929700	3931380	Oh, 33 again.
3931940	3933540	Regular pass with a 16.
3933540	3934260	Okay.
3934260	3939860	With a regular pass, you think that the baseballs are placed very strangely around this room.
3939860	3944100	And why does an old man have a bunch of baseballs hanging around?
3944100	3945460	They're like a distinct pattern.
3946020	3946980	No, not really.
3946980	3948500	What about to me?
3948500	3949780	Roll SIGINT, I guess.
3950900	3951860	No, it's a fail.
3951860	3953220	It's an 89 on a 40.
3953220	3954260	Yeah, that ain't going to do it.
3954260	3959700	And then with the crit success, you note he has a copy of As You Like It.
3959700	3960100	For me, what is that?
3960100	3961620	Which is written by Shakespeare.
3961620	3961860	Yeah.
3961860	3962580	Okay.
3962580	3962980	Okay.
3962980	3964500	So that's what I wanted to ask about.
3964500	3967780	Does this copy of As You Like It look like it came from one of the sets upstairs?
3967780	3968580	Yeah, totally.
3969140	3970900	Same printing, same publishing company.
3970900	3971220	Yeah.
3971220	3974900	Clarissa is picking it up and is holding it and waiting for him to get back in the room.
3974900	3975300	Cool.
3975300	3977300	Kevin's like, he likes Shakespeare too?
3977300	3983700	So he comes back in with tea for himself and chocolate milk for Elwood and Kevin.
3984260	3989620	And then he looks at Agent Sparrow and he's like, seriously, dig in.
3990260	3990900	Hey, thanks.
3990900	3992340	Are you a thief too?
3992340	3993940	So she's holding the book, she says.
3993940	3995860	Complete works of William Shakespeare.
3996500	3997060	Huffington.
3998100	3998660	Huffington.
4001140	4002260	Fartington Publishers.
4003700	4005780	Third edition, 1976.
4005780	4006260	Yeah.
4006260	4009300	That's the same one that Alvin Chilton had upstairs.
4009300	4010820	Did you take this from his room?
4010820	4011860	Oh, no.
4011860	4013780	Arvin lent that to me.
4014740	4016980	He lent it to me to read.
4016980	4017620	When?
4017620	4018660	Can I humint that?
4018660	4019620	Yeah, you can humint that.
4019620	4022420	Fuck.
4023060	4024580	It's a 52 on a 50.
4024580	4025940	I got a 16 on an 80.
4026500	4028740	I got a 45 on a 20.
4029780	4035140	With his success, you see that he seems to be telling the truth.
4035140	4038180	He did get it from Arvin Chilton.
4038180	4040740	Arvin gave it to me.
4040740	4041860	He gave it to me.
4042820	4045540	He's not feeling weird or wonky around by cops.
4045540	4047700	He's like, I didn't take it.
4047700	4050020	Is Arvin's crime spree public knowledge?
4050660	4051140	Yes.
4051140	4052900	And he's identified as a suspect.
4052900	4053620	Arvin.
4053620	4053860	Yeah.
4053860	4054580	Yes.
4054580	4055220	Okay.
4055220	4057460	So, like, this guy knows that Arvin is...
4057460	4058820	He didn't do it.
4058820	4059540	I swear.
4059540	4060420	Like, he wouldn't...
4063060	4064260	He wouldn't have done it.
4064260	4065220	He was a good guy.
4065220	4066740	Well, that's what we're trying to figure out.
4066740	4068980	We're trying to figure out who did these horrible things.
4068980	4071300	Now, when did Arvin lend you that book?
4073780	4074340	My mind.
4075140	4077140	You know, it's a...
4077140	4078900	Try and think, please.
4080100	4081300	It fails so much.
4083220	4086660	The 20th, maybe the 19th.
4086660	4090100	Maybe it was right before he disappeared on the 21st.
4090660	4091620	It was very recent.
4091620	4092500	Yeah, it was recent.
4092500	4094100	Did you and Arvin talk often?
4094100	4095620	Yeah, he was really nice.
4095620	4101460	He would pick me up groceries if I needed something and I wasn't doing well.
4101460	4102180	I had a fall.
4105220	4109220	Two years ago and he took such good care of me.
4109860	4111940	What's the last thing you guys talked about?
4114340	4117460	He was getting ready to go to Starbucks.
4117460	4118420	That's where he worked.
4119060	4120020	That's where he worked.
4120020	4123540	And I haven't seen him since that morning.
4123540	4126100	He was getting ready to go in for a shift.
4126100	4128180	Did he see another character that day?
4128180	4130180	No, everything seems so normal.
4130820	4135620	And honestly, people talk about him doing all these horrible things.
4135620	4136420	He wouldn't have done it.
4136420	4137700	Agent Asparrow, please.
4137700	4140260	You have to try some of these cold cuts or these olives.
4140260	4140820	Aren't they good?
4140820	4142900	Did Arvin seem like a troubled man to you?
4142900	4146660	He ignores your question completely and is waiting for an answer.
4146660	4149460	Elwood is licking his fingers off.
4149460	4151460	Yeah, the olives are great.
4151460	4153460	They're like old, which Elwood loves.
4156500	4157300	They taste old.
4157940	4159300	That's the way I like them.
4160260	4160760	Good.
4161220	4165780	Kevin, ever since he played football, has been very in tune with his body.
4166500	4173620	Does he feel sick or weird or anything from the half board of meat that he's eaten?
4174180	4175060	Roll Constitution.
4178020	4178900	Crit success.
4178900	4183140	You are extremely worried about how long this meat has been left out.
4183140	4186740	You are very worried about how long this meat has been left out.
4186740	4195060	It is not reacting in your tum tum the way that a nice shock bowl would feel in your tummy.
4195060	4197220	Um, I'm sick.
4197220	4200260	And he gets up and goes and throws up in the kitchen sink.
4200980	4202740	He's trying to make us sick.
4202740	4204820	Are you trying to poison us, Mr. Deschenes?
4204820	4206260	No, no, God, no.
4206260	4207220	I'm sorry.
4207220	4210500	I must have just forgotten when I bought it.
4210500	4211540	I would never.
4211540	4214820	You could go away for a long time if you tried to do harm to federal agents.
4214820	4215940	Is that what you're trying to do?
4215940	4217860	Oh my goodness.
4217860	4219220	No, no.
4219220	4222340	Kevin comes back over and sits down and grabs another hand.
4222340	4224980	Like without thinking, just grabs another handful of meat.
4224980	4226500	Elwood tries to grab his hand.
4226500	4227780	It's already in his mouth.
4229060	4232500	He like lifts you up off of your chair to take a bite.
4233380	4235460	Kevin, he just said it didn't make you feel good.
4236100	4237940	Oh, well.
4237940	4240100	And he just kind of sits there chewing on it.
4240100	4242260	He's holding, uh, Elwood's holding his hand out in front of Kevin.
4242260	4243060	Spit it out.
4243060	4243940	Spit it out.
4243940	4246020	Kevin spits out his food into Elwood's hand.
4246020	4248180	Clarissa is watching that just like wide-eyed.
4249380	4252180	Elwood takes it and puts it back onto the charcuterie board.
4253700	4254500	Now, where were we?
4255140	4257220	Yeah, uh, where were we?
4257220	4265540	Deschenes' face is twisted and contorted into this so grossed out and so happy.
4265540	4271700	It's clear that he's like a little freak in this moment and he's just like super into it.
4272260	4275780	He really gets along with Elwood like immediately.
4275780	4277700	The vibes are there.
4277700	4280420	The aura around both of them is similar.
4280420	4281060	Similar, yeah.
4281780	4285700	The reason Kevin didn't notice his stink is because he's used to Elwood's stink.
4287780	4294180	Mr. Deschenes, did Arvin mention this particular play as one of his favorites?
4294180	4295620	Is there a reason he lent it to you?
4296420	4299060	Yeah, he thought it was fitting.
4301780	4306580	Feels like I'm on the last bend of the deep end.
4306580	4309780	But the drowning's been just fine.
4310420	4318020	And when my ears pop and the shell shock of this pit stop frees my mind.
4318740	4320820	I'll be alright.
4320820	4324900	I can go there now that I stare.
4324900	4326900	Death in the face.
4326900	4328980	I'll be alright.
4328980	4332740	I can go there now that I stare.
4332740	4334260	Death in the face.
4351300	4358260	Doesn't it always seem like the parts that made us laugh now make us cry?
4359460	4366740	Doesn't it always seem like the villain Paul in the strings is a regular guy?
4367860	4373140	You and me have gone bad in a good way, I promise.
4375940	4381380	Kerosene wipes clean what we couldn't bear to tarnish.
4383940	4385940	I'll be alright.
4385940	4389940	I can go there now that I stare.
4389940	4392020	Death in the face.
4392020	4394100	I'll be alright.
4394100	4397860	I can go there now that I stare.
4397860	4400900	Death in the face.
4415940	4440900	There's a conundrum in the wisdom of my spirit.
4440900	4448740	Whitewashed hymns and the deadliest sins push me to my limit.
4448740	4456900	But when you deconstruct, you shit out of luck for a minute.
4456900	4462900	After the last bend, you can break it all down to rebuild it.
4462900	4488900	You and me have gone bad in a good way, I promise.
4488900	4496900	You and me have gone bad in a good way, I promise.
4496900	4498900	I'll be alright.
4498900	4502900	I can go there now that I stare.
4502900	4504900	Death in the face.
4504900	4506900	I'll be alright.
4506900	4512900	I can go there now that I stare.
4518900	4524900	You and me have gone bad in a good way, I promise.
