0	3040	Well, how do you do, pupparoos?
3040	6760	It's your grown-ass pup mother, Wolf the dog.
6760	11240	And I am here to provide nourishment for your wittle ears.
11240	14040	It's also live, I'm told.
14040	17840	From 694.2 PTBP, maybe.
17840	21440	The only radio station that can broadcast
21440	24700	in multiple dimensions, probably.
24700	27400	But what I'm rock solid for sure about
27440	30520	is the fact that we got a new Howlin' with Wolf,
30520	33820	everyone named Wolf's favorite segment.
33820	35800	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from
35800	37840	Nick with Everything's a Mimic,
37840	41080	who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,
41080	45880	which is, whoa, something you can do too, dear listener.
45880	48520	So cool of you, wow.
48520	51360	Nick with Everything's a Mimic writes,
51360	56160	hello, Mr. Dog, long-time listener, first-time writer.
56160	58520	Normally, I would take this opportunity
58520	62560	to shout out the actual play podcast, Everything's a Mimic,
62560	67560	and our players, Ryan D, Ryan B, Chris, Cody, and Andy.
68440	71080	Normally, this would also be the perfect time
71080	75000	to shout out our website, Everything's a Mimic dot com.
75000	77640	But now is just not that time,
77640	80080	for I have seen the yellow sign.
80080	83480	Its insignia dances carelessly and purposely
83480	86780	in and out of the black void of our empty vessels
86780	90280	like the ebb and flow of the ocean's embrace.
90280	93880	The pallid mask seeks all who are willing,
93880	96960	and, oh shit, I ran out of characters.
96960	100320	Love you, PTBP boys.
100320	103380	Thanks for the love, Nick with Everything's a Mimic.
103380	106460	Can anyone who knows what the fuck a podcast is
106460	108960	tell me what an actual play is?
108960	112300	Do they actually do things?
112300	115980	Or do they imaginarily do things?
115980	120060	Is an actual play like a real Shakespeare?
120060	123860	I'm so confused by the internet and all it beholds.
123860	127520	One day, when I remember my AOL password,
127520	130660	I'll get to get back on there and see what's poppin'.
130660	133060	If you wanna write up somethin' for your wolf to howl,
133060	136340	tag at PretendingPod on the internets.
136340	138460	Or don't, what do I care?
138460	141580	Though I will say it warms my producer's bones
141580	145220	every time he sees kind words written about pretending
145220	148400	to be people out there on the damn internet.
148400	152600	So if you wanna positively impact my producer's day,
152600	155860	and maybe write some words for wolf to say,
155860	159660	tag at PretendingPod and check out this segue.
159660	163460	One gave me a bruise, the other gave me the blues.
163460	168140	The first part's a segue, and next it's the news.
168140	172260	The boy on the table, Carl Lambert's long-lost brother,
172260	175740	who somehow hasn't aged in three decades,
175740	177820	seems to have been bitten by something
177820	179780	that looks a bit like a tick.
179780	182140	But it's got more than eight legs,
182140	184820	and last I recall, ticks can't normally
184820	187420	phase through matter, like if they wanted
187420	190200	to get into Doreen Morreen's boot
190200	193540	just by pullin' some kind of Hayden Christensen
193540	195380	and Jumper nonsense.
195380	199100	But this here is, indeed, some Jake Gyllenhaal
199100	201300	crawlin' around with Danny DeVito
201300	205340	while chasin' car crashes in his blue kinda stuff.
205340	208180	The Chuckster hollowed for Agent Morreen
208180	210880	to pour some of the potion out of the cauldron
210880	213740	and into her boot, which she promptly did.
213740	217920	Hopefully, luckily, this elixir was exceptionally brewed
217920	222860	by Dr. Rusty Hooch, all while Dr. Olivia Miller
222860	225220	just stared at the rash around the bite
226100	229180	on the unnaturally young boy's bruised and bloodied chest.
229180	233820	The rash rippled like waves from the terrible epicenter,
233820	236380	and the flushed bumps formed a target
236380	239140	on the most recent victim's body.
239140	243140	Unrelated, here's Molly Healy with Circles.
243140	248140	["Circles of Death"]
273140	278140	["Circles of Death"]
280980	282740	So I was writing down secret things
282740	285900	that I'm not allowed to see, but it's in my eye line.
285900	286820	That's like when people are like,
286820	288580	"'Don't look at my cards,"
288580	290660	and they're like showing you their cards.
290660	292620	It's like, it's not my decision,
292620	294300	my mental decision to look at your cards,
294300	296900	but physically, my body will turn towards your cards.
296900	298020	Yeah, like guess what, bitch?
298020	301800	God helps those who help themselves, so hide it.
301800	303600	Oh my God, I love God.
303600	308600	["Circles of Death"]
310100	315100	["In the Arms of the Angel"]
317200	319000	You know when you're just like loving God?
319000	320160	Sarah McLachlan.
322400	323240	All right, Ellie.
323240	324080	I, uh.
324080	324920	All right.
326920	327760	You first.
327760	330160	Did you open your email, Zach?
330160	331520	Oh God, what?
332720	335200	I don't know if it's linked to your email, though.
335200	336400	It might not be, nevermind.
336400	339440	Eleanor Tilleranzo just became a patron
339440	344440	of pretending to be people at one of the coolest tiers.
345480	346480	420?
346480	350120	No, 420 a month would be a hell of a Patreon tier.
350120	352460	She's at the $6.66 level.
352460	354960	Yeah, hell yeah.
354960	359060	You can be a patron at the $5 level
359060	361480	at patreon.com slash pretending pod,
362080	365920	and you can get all of our bonus audio content there,
365920	368120	including full episodes of full Delta Green
368120	371040	like home brew campaign that I ran for the boys,
371040	375560	and you can have Taylor's phone call fully sound
375560	377300	as your ringtone.
377300	378140	Ring, ring.
378140	378980	It's on.
378980	379800	Ring, ring.
379800	381480	But I think Chuck's version of it would be like,
381480	385680	bring, bring, bring, bring, bring, bring, bring.
385680	386720	Bring it, bro.
386720	389560	All right, but Eleanor signed up
389560	394200	at the much cooler $6.66 level,
394200	398120	which is all the exact same rewards.
398120	399820	It's just a cooler number.
399820	404820	Yeah, and I wanna be cool.
406400	407600	So far, so good.
407600	408660	Right, right, right?
408660	411660	No, I was never cool, but I was cold.
411660	413080	My heart is dead.
413080	414720	No, I'm kidding.
414720	417220	What were you like in school?
417220	419080	I was a slut, to be honest.
419520	420520	If you guys haven't figured it out,
420520	424780	but I was totally, at least by American standards.
426480	428240	But I wasn't judged for it, which was great.
428240	429080	Oh, that's great.
429080	430260	That's nice.
430260	435260	I was fondling the D and the P all up in high school,
435760	437200	but no one really judged me for it.
437200	439760	Wait, what's the difference between the D and the P?
439760	443880	One is a hole and one is like a thing
443880	446760	that really shoves things into a hole.
446760	450360	Wait, what are you putting in between the penis
450360	451920	and the vagina to have sex?
451920	452760	I get it.
452760	453600	You shoving something in?
453600	456480	No, no, the P stands for, okay,
456480	459880	the P stands for pussy, pussy.
459880	460720	I thought you were like,
460720	462520	I'm playing with dicks and penises,
462520	466660	and I'm like, I don't wanna discredit your sluttiness,
466660	468440	but that's the same damn thing.
468440	470480	Yeah, you would also be like,
470480	471920	that's when you find out I was lying.
471920	474240	I'm like, I was playing with something called the dick
474240	478460	and I'm the penis with my vagina.
479760	482480	I stuck my vagina inside his penis.
483840	485760	That's how you do it, right?
485760	486680	And then I got pregnant.
486680	487520	No, I didn't.
489960	491040	That was a lot later.
492760	494760	Pretending to be teen pregnant.
496020	499080	You're like, Junie's actually 10 years old.
499080	502280	I know she's just developing a little slower.
502320	505680	Swedish babies take a little longer to cook.
505680	508800	We're like elves, 3,000 years old,
508800	510940	but it's like, oh, or baby Yoda.
512640	513480	Spoilers.
516480	518160	Spoilers, baby Yoda exists.
520120	521920	Yo, are you watching Boba Fett?
521920	523080	So here's the thing, Zach,
523080	524280	when you become a parent,
524280	528320	you have to basically choose your form of entertainment
528320	531200	because you have 10 minutes a day, maybe.
531200	535760	And I've put mine into Yellowstone, great show,
535760	538280	in case you guys haven't checked it out
538280	541800	because I'm super into Western awful people, apparently.
541800	543400	So that's who I like to watch.
544360	546080	Hell yeah, that rules.
546080	548280	I don't know what, I was just gonna talk about
548280	552080	how Thundercat is the cameo in the last episode
552080	553580	of Boba Fett and it made me so happy.
553580	555840	He's a bass player who's fucking awesome.
555840	556680	He's like-
556680	557500	Wait.
558500	562020	Thundercat, like the Thundercats, like the lion?
563300	565540	No, that would be so fucking rad.
565540	568540	No, it's a very cool musician
568540	571180	who Taylor is singing Dragon Ball Durag right now,
571180	572780	which is a bop.
572780	574060	Such a fun song.
574060	575260	Such a good song.
575260	576340	He's such a cool guy.
576340	578540	He like wears like-
578540	583540	It's like kimono print boxers that are like silky.
583780	587580	Dragon Ball Z embroidered logo on them.
587580	590900	It's like, he's a nerd and he's sexy
590900	594360	and he makes dope music and he's in Star Wars now.
594360	597100	So he's my hero.
597100	599620	Wait, Boba Fett is Star Wars?
599620	600460	Oh my God.
600460	604100	Yeah, Boba Fett is the assassin, right?
604100	608460	Like he's a hired, to me, the clone's out of him.
608460	612780	All right, midichlorians, let's dive into the-
613020	615060	The fourth episode of-
618940	622380	Live long and may the peace be on upon you.
622380	625180	Give you peace as you sleep and may you know
625180	628900	that the Lord, your God, loves you very, very much.
628900	631340	That is what my parents said to me every night
631340	634020	before I went to sleep and dreamed about demons.
634020	634860	Let's go.
637660	639020	So much to unpack.
639020	639860	So much to unpack.
639860	642500	Oh yeah, we all have religious trauma in this house.
643340	646700	Really, I need to know so much because I'm such an atheist.
646700	648340	Oh shit.
648340	651380	Raise your hand if you've spoken in tongues at this table.
651380	652220	What?
652220	655060	Yeah, that's two of us who acted like we were communicating
655060	658820	with the other side and no one thought it was cool.
658820	661420	It was like we were wearing khakis when we did it.
661420	666260	Like it wasn't fucking rad, it was lame and it's also cool.
666260	669500	I don't know, the church should lean into metal imagery
669500	671460	and I'd be way more into it.
672340	675700	All right, let's actually, let's play a game.
675700	680300	I like a bit of chitchat, but I'm very interested
680300	682940	to see what happens next and I have to know.
682940	684340	So let's get into this.
684340	685380	Well, it's like it's your choice.
685380	689460	You're either gonna let my cool ass boot move work
689460	693700	or Doreen, I guess, I don't know, loses a foot.
693700	695380	I don't know what's happening.
695380	696800	I do.
696800	699860	I have a sense, unfortunately, of what's about to happen.
699860	700700	Oh, unfortunately.
701020	702020	You know what, Zach?
702020	703380	I'll just take over from here.
703380	704340	Okay, sounds good.
704340	709340	Okay, so a little bit of meta game,
712980	714580	outside of the game knowledge,
714580	717220	just because it might be good to know this.
718180	720820	Okay, sometimes I just try to talk
720820	724140	and the thing I say is dumb and stupid, so.
724140	725980	Zach, I'm gonna need you to roll sanity for me.
725980	728540	Oh, that happens to me all the time.
728540	731940	I've had a new catchphrase around the house recently
731940	733820	when Taylor's like, what did you just say?
733820	736100	I say, I'm allowed to say stupid things.
736100	738420	He's been saying it so often.
738420	741060	I've been saying a lot of stupid shit recently.
741060	742380	You're not allowed to divorce me
742380	743620	because I say stupid things.
743620	744620	Just because I'm an idiot
744620	746500	doesn't mean you should love me any less.
746500	748740	He blamed COVID quite a bit.
748740	749580	Yeah.
749580	750620	Apparently COVID makes you dumber.
750620	753100	Yeah, I'm a fucking idiot now.
753100	754620	When I was pregnant, I blamed it all the time.
754620	756460	I'm like, guys, it's the pregnancy brain,
756460	757820	you know, it's the mom brain.
757940	760020	And so every time I say something dumb,
760020	761420	it's what I blame.
761420	764580	But one day you realize it's all a lie, Zach.
764580	765420	I know.
765420	767580	You're just stupid.
767580	769580	Well, I'd been doing dry January
769580	771700	and so previously I was like,
771700	773380	it's just cause I'm high all the time.
773380	775820	But apparently, no, it's not.
775820	776660	So I-
776660	778220	Oh wait, for dry January,
778220	779740	you're not allowed to smoke either?
779740	782020	Well, that's what I gave a go.
782020	782860	Zach set rules.
782860	783700	You're doing sober January.
783700	787060	He's doing fully clear mind January.
787140	788900	Until last night and I'm-
789780	792340	All right, but I'll get back.
792340	794980	I'll get back on for the rest of the month.
794980	796180	How about that?
796180	798660	Taylor gave me a look like, really, motherfucker?
798660	800180	Well, last night he's like, I think I'm done.
800180	801500	I think January is over.
803060	805420	It's February negative 11th.
806580	807420	Yep.
808460	809540	Amazing.
809540	811580	February, the shittiest month.
811580	814180	Like it always gets treated so poorly.
814180	816020	It's like you get 28 days
816020	817500	and now minus 11.
819540	822060	The 39 days of February.
822060	823620	All right, let's-
823620	826420	On the negative 10th day of February,
826420	827260	I drink a beer.
827260	828780	God fucking scared.
832060	834580	All right, let us begin.
838340	840420	He can't decide if he's going to let my cool thing happen.
840420	841900	Have faith.
841900	845060	George Michael this situation and let's get into it.
845060	846660	We were in dexterity order.
846660	848100	It was during Marine's turn.
848100	849820	Now it is Dr. Miller's turn.
849820	852540	Oh no, I hate, wait.
852540	854540	Right at the top of the episode.
854540	855980	Yeah, fuck, man.
857740	861660	Okay, so just like a brief little thing,
861660	863100	what was summary of what happened.
863100	865180	Eleanor, that's a really good point.
865180	868380	Let's give a quick rundown of everything that happened
868380	869620	in each of your introductions.
869620	870460	No, I'm just kidding.
870460	872700	So you guys got here,
872740	875740	you got your hazmat suits on ready to go.
875740	878220	They came out with the camera to shoot a Bush video.
878220	880380	You told them, hey, I'm not here to be on camera
880380	881900	until I know this shit is real.
881900	883180	Let's get inside.
883180	886180	As you get inside, you all see not the body of a Bigfoot,
886180	891180	but rather the blues and bruddy body of a 12 year old boy
891660	895180	who is just filled with bullet holes from a 12 gauge.
895180	898540	And there's just blood everywhere pouring onto this tarp
898540	901420	that he's laying on, which is on a pool table.
901420	905740	Carl yells out for his younger brother, Michael,
905740	908180	and he's just begins weeping and weeping.
908180	912140	Michael, his brother who disappeared at age 12,
912140	915940	Carl and his dad both said that Bigfoot had abducted
915940	916780	this boy.
916780	920020	That's what they remember happening in their minds.
920020	923340	That's how they must've explained it to themselves
923340	925620	to try to explain it to other people.
925620	929100	And so now everyone's kind of running around.
929100	930980	Dr. Miller's looking at the body.
930980	935420	Doreen Marine has grabbed this substance, this potion,
935420	937100	if you will, that's in a tiny cauldron
937100	938620	for some goddamn reason.
942100	945580	And then she's pouring it into her boot because Charles,
945580	949700	the Chuckster has screamed that she needs to pour this
949700	950780	into her boot.
950780	954820	Not knowing what's actually in this potion
954820	957460	could just be acid that melts her entire fucking foot off.
957780	959740	I mean, whatever you gotta do.
959740	962140	Dr. Hooch is the one who's created
962140	966260	this pharmaceutical remedy with a critical success
966260	967740	while in the lab.
967740	971580	Janice is on the ground underneath Charles, the Chuckster,
971580	974380	who has just disarmed her and is keeping her.
974380	978220	I feel like you're kind of like on her back a little bit.
978220	982340	Yeah, I've got my knee down kind of over her.
982340	983660	Riding her like a pony.
983660	984500	Absolutely.
985060	989140	That's some genuine Chuckster moves right there.
989140	990540	Jump on it.
990540	994420	I'm doing like a little lasso, fake lasso spin.
994420	995420	Janice.
997180	1002180	And Carl and Jerome are kind of in this weird back and forth
1002340	1005740	where Carl keeps rolling fails on his sanity
1005740	1006940	to kind of get upset,
1006940	1009860	but Jerome keeps rolling really well to calm him down
1009860	1011500	and they're fucking homies.
1011500	1014460	And you can tell guys, as you're looking at the two of them,
1014460	1017620	their bond seems to be unshakable.
1017620	1019660	These two dudes have lived life together
1019660	1021020	for the past three years.
1021020	1024100	Honestly, it's cool to see men of this age
1024100	1026100	being so emotionally full.
1027540	1030340	Yeah, fucking gay man.
1030340	1032060	And this is why it's hard for,
1032060	1034740	yeah, it's hard to be a man in 2018.
1034740	1036580	Yeah.
1036580	1038140	Woe is the white man.
1038980	1039820	Yeah.
1041660	1043620	Cause Ali's always calling me gay.
1045260	1046860	I'm such a bully.
1046860	1049620	Yeah, wait, that's bullying to call me gay, Ali?
1049620	1051340	Yeah, because being gay is so bad.
1052340	1053180	Oh no.
1055060	1056780	Quick reminder for the audience.
1056780	1057900	Gays suck.
1057900	1059460	Oh my God.
1059460	1061060	Double down.
1061060	1064860	I prefer calling him weak, emotionally weak.
1068620	1069540	Holy shit.
1069540	1071500	I'm rubber, you're glue.
1072420	1074820	You like pussy and I like you.
1079980	1081700	We talked about that last episode.
1081700	1084420	What if you guys found out I'm super homophobic
1084420	1086220	or something awesomely awful?
1086220	1088060	Right in the middle of the fourth episode,
1088060	1091420	you're a bigot and we're like, what the fuck?
1091420	1093220	Yeah, no, but honestly guys.
1093220	1098220	I can't wait to leave a review on how I was treated
1098380	1099220	on this podcast.
1102220	1105820	I think we're now, we stayed very on track
1105820	1108340	with the rundown of what's happened so far.
1108340	1111860	And I think that probably gave Dr. Miller enough time
1111860	1115420	to figure out exactly what she's doing
1115420	1117380	with this first turn of her round.
1117380	1118220	What is that?
1118220	1120100	I've been trying to, I've been trying to catch
1120140	1123820	this little tick for the past 60 rounds.
1123820	1127660	So I think if she can see it now, can she see it now?
1127660	1128660	Can we all see it?
1128660	1129500	Nope.
1129500	1131540	Does she know that it went in the boot?
1131540	1132380	It does not.
1132380	1133260	Oh, it already went into the boot.
1133260	1134620	Oh shit.
1134620	1135460	Then.
1135460	1136860	Oh, I'm sorry, fuck.
1136860	1137940	I mean, you should have all assumed
1137940	1140740	because I had her pour a potion down in her boot.
1140740	1143620	Yeah, you could maybe yell something in character right now
1143620	1145820	for just the story to make sense, I guess,
1145820	1146660	maybe a little bit.
1146660	1147980	It's the alien bomb.
1150140	1150980	Bug.
1151980	1152820	Where is it?
1152820	1153820	In the boot.
1157100	1157940	Okay.
1158820	1160140	I don't know why.
1162140	1164860	It's the alien bug in the boot, all right.
1164860	1165980	It's the alien bug in the boot.
1165980	1167380	It's the alien bug in the boot.
1167380	1168580	It's the alien bug, it's the alien bug,
1168580	1169420	it's the alien bug in the boot.
1169420	1172700	So Dr. Miller, she sees Doreen Morin
1172700	1176380	pouring the liquid into her boot and she's like, oh no.
1176380	1179300	And so she hurries over and I think tries
1179300	1182700	to get the boot off of Dr. Morin.
1182700	1183540	I'm sorry, Dr. Morin.
1183540	1184860	Morin, Doreen.
1184860	1185700	You've been upgraded.
1185700	1186620	You upgraded, yeah.
1186620	1188460	You're a doctor now, we're all a doctor.
1190460	1191300	Look at me.
1191300	1193740	I guess technically we're supposed to all be doctors.
1193740	1194580	I think we're all.
1194580	1195420	I'm a doctor, you're a doctor.
1195420	1196260	Oh right, med students.
1196260	1197300	We are all supposed to be.
1197300	1198740	Oh, that's right.
1198740	1199580	She says, doctor.
1199580	1200420	Yes, doctor.
1200420	1201260	Get your boot off, doctor.
1201260	1202080	Take your clothes off.
1202080	1202920	Okay, doctor.
1202920	1203740	Take your clothes off.
1203740	1205620	I strip naked.
1205620	1207180	Yeah, not those clothes.
1207500	1210780	Okay, down to her boots.
1210780	1212100	Hey, quick question, Zach.
1212100	1215740	How does it get in the boot if she has a hazmat suit on?
1215740	1217940	You don't know that it went in the boot.
1217940	1220740	The thing that I told you when no one else was listening.
1223340	1225220	Wow, you are the Luke of this group.
1225220	1226060	Jesus Christ.
1228420	1229660	Do we need to take our?
1229660	1230580	Oh yeah.
1230580	1232660	I remember how it got in the boot.
1232660	1235140	If it even is in the boot, you know.
1235140	1235980	That's a good point.
1236300	1238140	That's a good point.
1238140	1241980	Okay, Dr. Miller runs forward to Maureen
1241980	1244660	and tries to like, is it in the boot?
1244660	1245500	Is it in the boot?
1245500	1248780	And then she's panically trying to get the boot off
1248780	1251480	and try to find this thing.
1251480	1254620	I like to think that Doreen Maureen loves her military boots
1254620	1256880	so goddamn much that she took them off
1256880	1260060	to put on the hazmat suit and then put the boots on
1260060	1262580	over the bottoms of the hazmat suit,
1262580	1265460	which is how she was able to pour this liquid
1265900	1268620	down into the boots while still wearing the hazmat suit.
1268620	1270060	Done, he's in the hazmat suit.
1270060	1271380	It's still over my foot.
1271380	1272220	Let's be clear about that.
1272220	1273940	Yeah, oh, it's definitely still over your foot.
1273940	1278420	And so Dr. Miller helps you remove the boot.
1278420	1279260	Okay.
1279260	1280700	Yeah, you take the boot off, you look inside,
1280700	1282060	you don't see anything.
1282060	1285040	Sick, where the fuck is it?
1285040	1285880	Yes.
1286980	1289260	You scream and Janice Ruth looks up
1289260	1291940	and she's like, what, where's what?
1291940	1294500	As she's being straddled by the truckster.
1294540	1296820	Where's what, what are you guys talking about?
1296820	1300260	And Jerome is like, wait, you said alien bug?
1300260	1301840	The fuck is going on?
1301840	1303260	What do you know?
1303260	1306540	They're cool, it's cool, they're cool, you can tell them.
1306540	1309420	All right, based on the stretch marks
1309420	1311540	on this poor boy over here,
1311540	1314060	I have reason to believe that it used to be something
1314060	1315620	that it's not anymore.
1315620	1319340	And what we saw was a tick running away from it.
1319340	1322420	And I can only assume tick tend to be only feeding off
1322620	1324780	organic live material.
1324780	1326820	If this boy has been dead for a while,
1326820	1329420	as I understand, several decades,
1329420	1330780	this doesn't make any sense.
1330780	1332740	So we need to find this tick.
1332740	1334980	So basically Dr. Miller reveals everything
1334980	1336340	she heard in private.
1336340	1338180	And then Chuck yells,
1338180	1339940	where, ticker, where, where, where.
1339940	1340980	Sorry, that's how I get into character.
1340980	1341820	Totally.
1343100	1346140	This isn't no normal tick though, bro.
1346140	1349900	This tick is like jumpy in time and space
1349900	1351500	and like versus there and then it's there
1351540	1353860	and then it's there and then guess what, what?
1353860	1355300	Where is it?
1355300	1356700	Is that true?
1356700	1357540	Is that true?
1357540	1359540	Then we can all be infected right now.
1359540	1362220	All I'm saying is that's what I saw, dude.
1362220	1366660	Everybody roll sanity, helplessness.
1366660	1369060	This is called helplessness.
1369060	1369900	Jesus.
1369900	1372220	You feel helpless and it's a ness.
1372220	1373060	Super fail.
1373060	1373900	11.
1373900	1375180	Not Loch Ness, it's just Bigfoot.
1375180	1376020	What?
1376020	1378180	78 on a 34.
1378180	1380420	A fail, lose one sanity.
1380420	1382780	I also failed 91 on a 54.
1382780	1384100	Lose one sanity.
1384100	1385820	11 on a 59.
1385820	1388060	Nice, critical success.
1388060	1389860	You gain sanity.
1389860	1391540	I gain sanity and I don't even know
1391540	1393740	if this tick is in my hazmat suit right now.
1395700	1396540	Critical success.
1396540	1399500	You're able to keep your head very much on your shoulders
1399500	1402420	and we'll go to Eleanor real quick for her sanity.
1402420	1403780	39 on a 55.
1403780	1407580	Congratulations, zero sanity lost in this situation.
1407620	1412100	You too will be able to act with a cutting edge movement.
1412100	1414140	You too, the edge.
1414140	1417300	All right, so shit.
1419940	1422740	Lindsay, because you critically succeeded
1422740	1424140	on your sanity check,
1424140	1426980	I am going to give you some information
1426980	1429140	that nobody else can hear.
1429140	1434140	So take off your headphones, wiggle your ears.
1434980	1437140	Hey, Ally, maybe don't fucking put your fingers
1437140	1438900	in your ears this time.
1438900	1439740	They can go on the outside.
1439740	1442100	Guys, it's been a joke from the beginning.
1444220	1446580	We don't do bits on this podcast, Ally.
1447900	1448940	Lindsay.
1448940	1451420	Yes, that's Doreen.
1451420	1453620	Doreen feels a bite on her foot.
1454940	1459060	Because you're clear and present in this situation,
1459060	1462020	it's very, very apparent to you
1462020	1465860	that underneath the hazmat suit, you've been bitten.
1466860	1470100	You know the feeling when you like see a bug
1470100	1472420	and then your skin starts to fucking crawl,
1472420	1474180	like you think that they're on you?
1475180	1478700	You feel that feeling all over your entire body.
1479700	1481620	Because you critically succeeded on your sanity,
1481620	1483300	I'm not gonna have your sanity again.
1483300	1484980	So you're gonna be able to have your wits about you
1484980	1486100	in this situation.
1486100	1489020	Stay calm, take care of it.
1489020	1492740	Can I just cut, just chop?
1492740	1494860	Can I just chop that bad boy off?
1495900	1497740	You can do whatever you would like to do.
1497740	1498940	I'm gonna get them back.
1498940	1500340	If that's your first instinct,
1500340	1503060	there's definitely a hatchet on the wall.
1503060	1507300	Like this is a barn slash camping, hunting.
1507300	1509260	And we have equipment to sew me back up.
1509260	1510220	Definitely.
1510220	1511060	Okay.
1511060	1513340	I mean, the mobile lab is probably a better option
1513340	1515940	for cutting off your foot than the hatchet
1515940	1517460	that you see on the wall.
1517460	1519220	You would only know that
1519220	1521420	because you critically succeed on the sanity.
1521420	1524580	Otherwise that hatchet's the best thing in the world.
1524620	1525980	All right, so I'm gonna bring them back
1525980	1526820	and then you can act.
1526820	1527660	Yes?
1527660	1528500	Yeah.
1528500	1529660	Okay.
1529660	1531140	Hello, come on back please.
1533660	1534780	Is this, okay.
1534780	1538420	Doreen just screams fuck
1538420	1540460	and just runs outside to the mobile lab.
1542740	1543740	Runs outside?
1543740	1544580	Runs outside.
1544580	1545460	Do you leave the door open?
1545460	1546300	She left us.
1546300	1548100	No, I closed the door behind me.
1548100	1549300	To the cabin.
1549300	1550140	To the cabin.
1550140	1551580	You just slam it behind you as you run out?
1551580	1552420	Yeah.
1553260	1554860	She left us.
1554860	1555940	She left us.
1557340	1558500	Dr. Hooch, you're up.
1558500	1560020	All right.
1560020	1560860	Fuck.
1561780	1565100	Did I see the tick going towards Doreen?
1565100	1565940	I don't know.
1565940	1568140	Did I tell you that you saw a tick going towards Doreen?
1569180	1570020	No, I don't think so.
1570020	1570860	I don't think you saw a tick going towards Doreen.
1570860	1573220	Okay, so all I know is that my potion
1573220	1574820	has been poured on a foot
1574820	1576980	instead of where I intended for it to go.
1576980	1578460	Uh-huh.
1578460	1579380	Hey, quick question.
1579380	1581300	Doreen, did you leave the rest of the vial,
1581780	1584260	the rest of the cauldron on the ground next to you?
1584260	1585740	And did you pour all of it?
1585740	1587580	No, remember at the end of the last episode
1587580	1588420	I said not all of it.
1588420	1589260	Not all of it.
1589260	1590580	Okay, okay, so there's a little bit left.
1590580	1593620	Okay, so I forget my British character.
1593620	1595020	Of course, yeah.
1595020	1596740	Fuck, God, God damn it.
1596740	1599100	Oh my God, my potion.
1599100	1601380	I jump for the cauldron.
1601380	1603020	I dive for the cauldron and grab it
1603020	1604620	and I scoop the rest of it up in it
1604620	1606260	and I'm on the ground scooping up
1606260	1608100	the rest of the potion into the cauldron.
1608140	1608980	Carl's going.
1611380	1612580	Is Carl near me?
1612580	1614220	No, he's on the other side of the pool table.
1614220	1615780	So yeah, I mean, he's just across
1615780	1617420	the pool table from you, I suppose.
1617420	1620660	Still elbows, staring at the corpse
1620660	1622380	of his younger brother who he fucking killed
1622380	1623940	and having a hard time getting over it.
1623940	1625580	It becomes clear to me pretty quickly
1625580	1627620	that Carl's emotions are gonna hinder us
1627620	1629340	in this process so I just throw
1629340	1631980	the rest of the cauldron on his face.
1631980	1633940	Holy shit, okay.
1633940	1636620	Yeah, go ahead and roll athletics just to,
1636620	1638460	I mean, I'll give you a plus 20
1638460	1641260	because he is completely still
1641260	1643940	and this seems pretty easy but in order
1643940	1645460	to get it enough of it.
1645460	1646820	And not on Jerome.
1646820	1648220	Oh, fuck.
1650940	1651780	Yeah.
1651780	1653820	49, or 46 on a 50.
1653820	1654660	Oh, nice, yeah.
1654660	1656860	So it splashes all over the face
1656860	1658660	of Carl Lambert and he's like,
1658660	1663660	whoa, what the, you're not British?
1664140	1665980	British?
1665980	1670340	As he like slowly slumps onto the ground
1670340	1674780	and Jerome is like, is that gonna knock him out
1674780	1676260	or kill him, what did you just do?
1676260	1677100	It'll just knock him out,
1677100	1678500	he'll just sleep real good for a bit.
1678500	1680340	Okay, okay, what's next?
1680340	1681180	What's next?
1681180	1682780	Fuck, fuck, where'd she go?
1682780	1683700	What is she doing?
1683700	1685060	It's Chuckster's turn.
1685060	1687980	I pull out my burner phone.
1687980	1689820	Well, I got this, guys.
1689900	1694900	And then I Google why this Bigfoot be a tick now though.
1700180	1701500	And then if you could just tell me
1701500	1704100	what my Google search results are.
1704100	1705380	Pull up your phone, grab your phone.
1705380	1706220	Yep.
1706220	1708220	Google why this Bigfoot be tick now.
1708220	1709060	Though.
1709060	1709900	Though.
1709900	1711060	Are you spelling though out
1711060	1713300	or is it just a THS situation?
1716260	1718060	Tick now though.
1720460	1721660	Stupid.
1721660	1722860	It says six steps what to do
1722860	1724220	when you find a tick on yourself.
1724220	1725980	Okay, this is great information.
1725980	1728940	Let's read off at least the first one.
1728940	1729780	Oh, wait, hold on.
1729780	1733820	The third result is a song by big homie G called Tick.
1733820	1736460	All right, Chuckster gets distracted by a song
1736460	1739660	instead of looking up what to do with a tick bite
1739660	1742220	which might've actually helped you in this situation.
1742220	1743780	It is Carl's turn.
1743780	1745620	He is asleep on the ground.
1745620	1747620	On a drink so I can't speak up,
1747620	1748980	bitch sucking my dick up.
1748980	1750740	If she bites, she gonna beat up.
1750740	1753580	I won't take no disrespect from no ho.
1753580	1756300	I'm a crazy bitch, I'm psycho.
1756300	1758420	Not a tip like a light show.
1758420	1759460	Gee, where you been?
1759460	1760460	Hell if I know.
1760460	1762740	Smoking runts, head in the sky, ho.
1762740	1765060	She says she's sick of me, bye ho.
1765060	1765900	I fucking hope.
1765900	1767060	Pull up that skirt, skirt.
1767060	1769060	Watching bitches stalk my bio.
1769060	1771140	I can't go nowhere without my money or my iron.
1771140	1773660	Okay, this is literally Chuckster's clicked on it
1773660	1775500	and this is just playing from his phone
1775500	1777060	and he's just looking at it now.
1777060	1778540	You fucking monster.
1779460	1783100	Janice's turn and Janice is still under him.
1783100	1786580	He is literally straddling Janice Ruth,
1786580	1789220	an asthmatic older woman,
1789220	1792780	and playing the song over his phone.
1792780	1794020	It is fucking-
1794020	1795900	Okay, honestly though, it's so relevant
1795900	1798180	because it says Johnny did these teeth.
1798180	1800820	Whole lotta cheese for these VV's.
1800820	1803660	I don't hardly be smiling but my shit big
1803660	1806580	when I say cheese like Carl's teeth.
1807100	1807940	Oh my God.
1810140	1813260	The truth comes out, I am big homie G.
1814420	1815980	This just turned into an episode
1815980	1816900	of Righteous Gems.
1819380	1822740	Oh my God, okay, it is Doreen Marine's turn.
1822740	1824100	Wait, so I wasn't helpful?
1824100	1826020	Oh no, I think you were extremely helpful.
1826020	1828820	I thought it was fucking, hey, I love you
1828820	1829860	and I loved that.
1829860	1830700	Oh my God.
1830700	1832340	Thank you, so I'm helping the mission
1832340	1833380	is what they all think?
1833380	1837220	I mean, unless there's like something in the wave,
1837220	1839580	like it would not be out of the realm
1839580	1842260	of Delta Green possibilities for the wavelengths
1842260	1846460	like underneath a song played by a certain Google search
1846460	1849540	would like pull up some sort of like spell like ability
1849540	1851140	in the air of the situation
1851140	1853300	but this is not one of those times.
1853300	1855100	Can I roll, wait, wait, wait, wait.
1855100	1859020	Can I roll military science?
1859020	1859980	Cause hear me out.
1860620	1865620	The military has been studying how to use music
1866300	1869940	to brainwash people into telling the truth.
1869940	1872700	Did you learn that in your one week at basic?
1872700	1874940	I spent two months there bitch.
1874940	1877380	And also, I'm sorry.
1877380	1880660	And also, so anyway, I think that I was
1880660	1883540	on the special forces team of basic training.
1883540	1884500	Oh my God.
1884500	1888780	I passed, so anyway, do with that what you will.
1888780	1891180	Your military science would tell you
1891180	1894300	that the action that you've just taken is not helpful.
1897340	1899820	Doreen, it's your turn.
1899820	1902220	What can I say here?
1902220	1904420	Is there anything off limits to say?
1904420	1906180	Let's have them take their headphones off.
1906180	1908340	Yeah, and let's just get this over with.
1910340	1911180	Wow.
1911180	1912540	Oh my God.
1912540	1914620	I mean, for your sake dude.
1916260	1917940	Okay, because I mean.
1917980	1919620	You're doing this alone?
1919620	1923220	Well, my actual brain wants to,
1923220	1925020	I'm trying to channel Doreen,
1925020	1928100	but I'm thinking like if I have full sanity during this,
1928100	1930060	my first thought would be I'm gonna run out
1930060	1932380	and grab tools to do this and come back.
1932380	1933220	And come back, okay.
1933220	1934460	And ask for help.
1934460	1935380	Right, okay.
1935380	1938340	Because if they know what's going on, it will help me.
1938340	1939980	And if I'm fully sane.
1939980	1940940	Totally.
1940940	1941780	Yeah.
1941780	1944300	The excruciating pain in your foot is growing
1944340	1948100	as you feel the bones in your foot begin to shatter.
1948100	1948940	I'm ready to get it off.
1948940	1952060	All of the bones in your foot just shattered
1952060	1957060	and your muscles are beginning to rip apart and reform.
1957460	1960940	All the tendons are stretching out in your foot.
1960940	1964700	You've never felt this much pain in your entire life.
1964700	1965820	Roll sanity.
1969100	1971140	Am I like hopping back into the?
1972140	1972980	Ugh.
1974820	1976300	No.
1976300	1977140	What did you roll?
1977140	1978260	99.
1978260	1979660	Are you fucking kidding me?
1979660	1980980	Fucking 99.
1980980	1982460	Are you serious?
1982460	1984300	Those dice are fucking cursed, dude.
1984300	1986300	These dice suck, I'm mad.
1986300	1988180	Hey, that's a critical failure.
1988180	1989020	I know.
1989020	1991340	On you realizing that you're about to turn
1991340	1993220	into a goddamn Bigfoot.
1994660	1996100	And you're by yourself.
1996100	1997100	I'm by myself.
1997100	1999340	I'm trying to get back, I tried to get back.
2000340	2001180	I tried.
2002100	2005940	Okay, so I'm gonna have you roll fight, flight or freeze
2005940	2006780	in this situation.
2006780	2007980	So I want you to rank them.
2007980	2009140	You're gonna roll a D six,
2009140	2011540	which is just the normal standard six sided dice
2011540	2013700	that you would use in normal games.
2013700	2015900	I say normal games like they're not lame.
2016860	2018500	Okay, so here's what I want you to do.
2018500	2022460	I want you to rank from most likely to least likely,
2022460	2025380	fight, flight or freeze.
2025380	2026940	So what is the most likely?
2026940	2028900	So fight.
2029540	2031460	Sorry, fight.
2031460	2034060	Allie and Taylor are being fucking wild,
2034060	2035060	rubbing their ears.
2035060	2036700	They have no clue what's going on.
2037980	2040540	You're making too much noise.
2040540	2041660	That's fair.
2041660	2042820	Oh, you can hear that?
2045140	2046500	No, I really can't hear anything.
2046500	2047700	I can't, I can't.
2047700	2050660	Okay, so I would definitely, my number one go to
2050660	2051940	as Dorian would be fight.
2051940	2053660	Okay, so that's four, five and six.
2053660	2055020	And then flight.
2055020	2056140	Okay, so that's two and three.
2056140	2056980	And then freeze.
2056980	2058340	Is one, so roll a D six.
2060340	2061180	Seven.
2062220	2063540	What the fuck?
2064540	2067620	I said, it's only got six sides Lindsay.
2067620	2069580	I read it wrong, I read it wrong.
2069580	2071660	It's a fancy dice, I couldn't see the thing.
2071660	2073660	Four, five, six is fight.
2075180	2078580	Hey Lindsay, Dorian Marine sees
2081100	2084340	a set of tools next to her.
2084340	2085700	She grabs a saw.
2086700	2090940	She's smart enough in this moment to strap her leg down
2090940	2094820	on this stretcher that is meant for the Bigfoot corpse.
2094820	2097100	And she cuts.
2097100	2099740	The first one is not the hardest actually.
2099740	2102580	Well, I'm feeling this other pain that seems worse.
2102580	2105180	It does seem worse until you hit a nerve.
2106460	2107580	And that's just this.
2111140	2113420	Just like running through the back of your head.
2114180	2118260	I mean, you just begin almost like violently coughing
2118260	2120860	and choking and your stomach hurts.
2120860	2124140	And if you have any food in your stomach, it's coming up
2124140	2127620	and you're just sawing and sawing and you start crying.
2127620	2129780	Tears are running down your face.
2129780	2133220	Just like hit the bone and then boom, you're just sawing.
2133220	2136340	Saw, saw, saw, saw, saw, saw, saw, saw, saw, saw
2136340	2138180	until finally crack.
2138180	2142540	This feeling is growing as it goes up into your ankle.
2142540	2145300	And as those bones begin to shatter
2145300	2146900	and the muscles begin to break,
2146900	2150100	it helps you cut the rest of your foot off.
2150100	2154260	Your entire foot is only hanging on by the skin
2154260	2156620	that is on the back of your calf,
2157500	2160260	attached to the skin on the back of your ankle
2160260	2163860	as you finally have cut through your Achilles tendon.
2163860	2166420	Just for listeners right now, I'm literally crying.
2166460	2167300	Yeah.
2171220	2175020	I mean, you start bleeding out almost immediately.
2175020	2180020	And so I need you to roll a D six and then add two
2180660	2182540	for how much hit points you lose.
2185900	2186740	One.
2186740	2187580	Wow, okay.
2187580	2190180	So one plus two is three, you lose three hit points
2190180	2195180	and Lindsey, you're gonna lose one D four to blood loss
2195340	2198460	every round until this is fixed.
2198460	2201820	What's your highest skill of medicine first aid?
2201820	2203720	Whoa, hang on.
2204580	2206740	I have zero in both.
2206740	2208540	Oh, you're fucked, dude.
2208540	2209820	Until someone comes out here,
2209820	2211980	you're bleeding out one D four per round.
2211980	2214860	Can I like scream as loud as possible for help?
2214860	2216460	Yes.
2216460	2218340	Yes, and I'll have them roll alertness.
2218340	2219180	Okay.
2219180	2220540	Do you need me to like scream?
2220540	2221980	That was absolutely miserable.
2221980	2222820	No, that was good.
2222940	2225140	I'm leaving the room from now on for those.
2225140	2225980	Yeah, sorry.
2225980	2227500	I thought that that wouldn't take as long,
2227500	2229660	but then some crazy fucking shit happened.
2229660	2231740	So Mabi, oh, Ellie.
2231740	2233820	She's scrolling this.
2233820	2234900	She's on Pinterest.
2234900	2236700	You on Pinterest, girl.
2236700	2240140	I was, I'm looking at pre-ordering the Elden Ring.
2240140	2240980	It looks so funny.
2240980	2242420	Oh, fuck yeah.
2242420	2245780	I need Dr. Miller, Rusty Hooch and the Chuckster
2245780	2248860	all to roll alertness real quick for me just to kick off.
2248860	2249700	Yes.
2251380	2253500	That's a big ass fail.
2253500	2255100	Big fail for me too.
2255100	2257380	Okay, Chuckster, you're the only one who hears
2257380	2262260	just the slightest faintest, just like blood curling scream.
2262260	2265660	Very, very muffled, but coming from outside.
2265660	2266820	Dr. Miller, it's your turn.
2266820	2268300	My D dog.
2268300	2270020	What's going on with my D dog?
2270020	2270860	Okay.
2272380	2273460	Seeing that she said like,
2273460	2276060	don't leave this house because we're all gonna die.
2276060	2279260	She's very disappointed in her colleague, Dr. Marine.
2279260	2284260	So she is going to take out a firearm from her hazmat suit
2287300	2291260	and actually follow Doreen ready to threaten her
2291260	2293060	to not leave and get back into the house.
2293060	2294980	And so she's gonna run after Doreen.
2294980	2296220	Yeah, you're gonna be able to make it
2296220	2297620	to the back of the van.
2297620	2300540	So you can start off the next turn, opening up that door.
2300540	2303300	It's gonna move on to Dr. Hooch.
2303300	2306220	Not Carl or Janice or anyone.
2308460	2311300	I mean, I want Dr. Hooch to have some power.
2311300	2312940	I just thought you were skipping.
2312940	2314980	Oh no, I'm actually skipping Jerome in this moment.
2314980	2315820	That's my bad.
2315820	2318020	Jerome, where'd she go?
2318020	2319060	Alien bug.
2319060	2321300	Someone tell me what the fuck is going on here.
2321300	2323500	I didn't know this shit was happening either.
2323500	2324460	You've knocked him out.
2324460	2325580	Do we need to...
2325580	2326940	Janice, are you okay?
2328340	2332780	Yeah, yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay.
2333140	2334820	I just need you to stay calm.
2334820	2338500	Okay, do you need to be on her right now?
2338500	2342180	I was just getting comfortable, but I mean, I guess not.
2342180	2344620	Hey, Janice, you gonna be cool?
2344620	2346580	Janice, be cool, please.
2346580	2349180	She trusts Jerome dire enough to where she's like,
2349180	2350820	okay, okay.
2350820	2352580	And she's just gonna walk back over
2352580	2355740	and go sit on the couch that's in the corner of the room.
2355740	2356860	And she's just sitting there
2356860	2358780	and she's just got her head in her hands
2358780	2361460	and she starts weeping uncontrollably.
2362860	2365980	Dr. Falsom, what do we do?
2365980	2367300	What is the plan?
2367300	2368140	What is happening?
2368140	2369780	You've got two people gone already.
2369780	2373100	I'm losing trust in Jerome Dyer.
2373100	2375260	I'm becoming suspicious of him.
2375260	2377060	Okay, I pull out a gun, I point it right at Jerome
2377060	2379300	and I say, show me your fucking ID right now.
2379300	2381260	What the fuck, dude?
2381260	2382740	Are you kidding me?
2382740	2384500	I'm the one who brought you here.
2384500	2385540	I don't trust you for shit.
2385540	2387420	You have no, you clearly have no fucking clue
2387420	2388820	what's going on. What would my ID do?
2388820	2389660	Show it to me.
2390340	2392780	Can she roll like an alertness or something
2392780	2394020	to see if she trusts him
2394020	2396220	or like to see if he's doing anything that might be.
2396220	2397060	Roll human.
2397060	2397900	Okay.
2397900	2399180	Human intelligence.
2399180	2400340	It's reading people.
2400340	2401740	Hugh Mint.
2404020	2404860	Is it 10?
2404860	2406700	Mr. Mint, Hugh Mint.
2406700	2408020	48 on a 10.
2408020	2412260	Yeah, unaware you continue your shitty line
2412260	2413940	and questioning piece of shit.
2413940	2417020	And he's like, I don't know what this will prove,
2417020	2419740	but he reaches back in his back pocket.
2419740	2422820	Okay, as he's reaching down, I just fucking tackle him.
2422820	2424420	Jesus Christ.
2424420	2426420	Okay, roll unarmed combat.
2430740	2432620	35 on a 40.
2432620	2433540	98.
2433540	2435460	Yeah, you take him right to the ground.
2435460	2437260	I mean, he's a small little nerd man.
2437260	2442260	And so fucking bang having banging black turtleneck
2442260	2447260	wearing Dr. Hootch just like lunges over the pool table,
2447740	2451740	over the corpse and just spears this dude into the ground.
2451740	2452820	Tight tackle, bro.
2454500	2455460	I'm saying, what do you know?
2455460	2456300	What do you know?
2456300	2457580	I know you know something.
2457580	2458580	I don't know shit.
2458580	2459540	What the fuck?
2459540	2460580	We're just trying to stop.
2460580	2462260	There's an alien bug apparently
2462260	2464660	and you're not doing anything to stop it.
2464660	2466100	And it's Chuckster's turn.
2466100	2470380	I'm still like humming the tune of my big homie G song.
2470380	2471740	And it's Carl's turn.
2473260	2475500	No, I'm still humming it under my breath.
2475500	2477460	And then I kind of like come to and I'm like,
2477460	2478300	what are we doing?
2478300	2480420	We can't be fighting ourselves, bros.
2480420	2484380	We gotta be helping each other take down this alien dick.
2484380	2487020	Now I say we all go out there and check on our friend.
2487020	2488180	Come on.
2488180	2490860	I am trying to keep control of this situation clearly
2490860	2491980	because nobody else is.
2491980	2493780	Everyone's just letting sheer chaos happen.
2493780	2495740	So I'll just hold down the Fort in here.
2495740	2499020	I'm still on top of Carl or Jerome, sorry.
2499100	2501820	You're on top of the sleepy, sleepy Carl.
2503020	2504980	I'm keeping control of this situation.
2506620	2507700	Okay, so you leave?
2507700	2509260	Yeah, I'm gonna run after Dr. Miller.
2509260	2510300	Yeah, I think that makes sense.
2510300	2511820	So Carl's still asleep.
2511820	2514100	Janice Ruth is crying on the couch.
2514100	2519100	And Doreen, you've got a D4 to roll please.
2520300	2521420	A D4.
2521420	2522260	It's a pyramid.
2522260	2523080	It's a little pyramid.
2523080	2523920	This guy?
2523920	2525220	Yeah.
2525220	2526060	Three.
2526060	2527180	Three.
2527180	2528020	You know what to do.
2528060	2530180	Like in yellow, back in yellow, back in yellow.
2530180	2533380	Dr. Miller, you run out into the darkness.
2533380	2535920	The street lamp is shining down.
2535920	2537220	It's the only thing.
2537220	2538820	Snow begins falling.
2538820	2540060	I think that's nice.
2540060	2542420	Snow begins falling down through the street light.
2542420	2544840	It's actually really, really beautiful.
2544840	2545680	And as you-
2545680	2548180	It's the most wonderful time.
2548180	2552780	Starts playing as you open up the back doors
2552780	2554740	of this sprinter van.
2554740	2557500	And Lindsay, can you describe what she sees?
2557820	2560140	I'm still just screaming and like growling
2560140	2565140	and trying to put pressure on this nub of a leg.
2566820	2569660	Could you demonstrate the screaming and the growling?
2569660	2570500	Ugh.
2572020	2572920	Something like that.
2572920	2574440	Like big, nevermind.
2575340	2576180	Like big what?
2577180	2578420	Big poop sounds.
2578420	2579720	Yeah.
2579720	2580560	I understand.
2580560	2582980	I didn't understand before, but now I get the sound.
2582980	2585060	You know when someone cuts off their foot
2585060	2586660	and they make sounds like-
2586660	2587500	Big poop sounds.
2587500	2588340	Big poop sounds.
2588340	2589180	Poop, poop, poop.
2589180	2590340	Wait, wait, wait.
2590340	2592780	She's putting pressure on a fucking nub.
2592780	2593620	On a nub.
2593620	2597460	And you see her foot and ankle standing up
2597460	2599460	on the stretcher next to her.
2599460	2602740	She's like strapped her leg down onto the stretcher.
2602740	2605700	Blood is pouring out between her fingers.
2605700	2608100	She has no idea what to do.
2608100	2611860	She is at less than half of her hit points.
2611860	2614820	And so she is turning white in the face
2614820	2618700	as she's crying and screaming and gurgling.
2618700	2623700	And literally the foot that is next to her is transforming.
2625560	2627860	So I need you to roll sanity real quick.
2627860	2630240	Oh, Jesus Christ.
2630240	2631420	Bigfoot foot.
2631420	2633860	Bigfoot foot, but only the foot so far.
2633860	2634780	Point of a Bigfoot.
2634780	2639780	Yeah, that's a big old 91 on 55 sanity.
2641460	2643180	This is extremely unnatural.
2643220	2647900	And so I'm going to have you roll a D4 and add one.
2647900	2649020	Four.
2649020	2650060	Four plus one?
2650060	2650880	Three plus one.
2650880	2651720	So four.
2651720	2655500	Oh, just one shy of that temporary insanity.
2655500	2659100	You lose your fucking shit because this foot,
2659100	2661540	you would know as a medical doctor
2661540	2664100	that you can see the bones,
2664100	2667620	part of which is sticking out of this foot
2667620	2671140	that's just sitting on this stretcher next to Doreen Marine.
2671140	2673040	The bones are shattering
2673040	2676220	and then seem to be reforming themselves
2676220	2679560	as the tendon, the Achilles tendon that she's severed
2679560	2682300	begins to stretch and grow out.
2682300	2685020	Like all of these things are trying to grow.
2685020	2688500	As they're shattering, you see the blood that's spreading out
2688500	2690860	and all the blood is coming up to the surface in this foot.
2690860	2692940	It's rapidly turning purple,
2692940	2695340	as well as the blood that's hitting the air up top
2695340	2696660	is finally oxidizing.
2696660	2699340	So red is starting to pour over the top
2699340	2702020	of all of these bruised and bloody foot
2702020	2705220	and Doreen is bleeding the fuck out
2705220	2707140	and with your sanity failure,
2707140	2711100	you're not able to attempt to stop the bleeding this round.
2711100	2713660	The Chuckster is running up behind you in this moment.
2713660	2715940	I think Dr. Miller turns around and throws up.
2715940	2718240	And you see the exact same thing
2718240	2720640	and I need you to roll a sanity as well.
2720640	2721480	Okay.
2722740	2724500	Really low odds of me.
2724500	2728820	Ah, 23 on a 33.
2729420	2731260	It's the first time I passed a sanity check.
2731260	2735860	You run up, you see Dr. Miller has turned towards you
2735860	2737260	and begins throwing up.
2737260	2741180	You nimbly dodge out of the way of this vomit
2741180	2745420	and you peek your head around and see Doreen Marine
2745420	2748940	and this foot, her bloody situation, what do you do?
2748940	2752140	So one thing about Chuck that you guys don't know
2752140	2754380	is he's very astute
2754380	2757700	and he puts things together really quickly as, yeah.
2757700	2758540	Oh, really?
2758540	2759860	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2759860	2761900	Did not know that about Chuck at all.
2761900	2764480	Yeah.
2764480	2766820	Yeah, so he doesn't talk about it that often.
2766820	2768500	He's a real humble boy.
2768500	2771200	But anyway, so he puts together
2771200	2773380	that the tick must have gone inside
2773380	2777440	and that if he shoots the leg,
2777440	2778900	it's just gonna leave again
2778900	2780140	and maybe infect something else.
2780140	2783100	So he wants that tick to stay inside the foot
2783100	2785480	and he notices a deep freeze.
2785480	2787520	So he's gonna throw the foot in the deep freeze
2788360	2789200	and lock it.
2789200	2790020	Smart.
2790020	2791500	And then he says, not today Bigfoot foot.
2791500	2792340	Yeah.
2796340	2797880	And then he fist bumps himself.
2802320	2804480	Extremely excellent work.
2804480	2805880	Thank you so much.
2805880	2808760	And Doreen, you continue to bleed out.
2808760	2809600	Roll a D4.
2809600	2810500	Yeah, sorry, Doreen.
2813640	2814800	I'm gonna die.
2816040	2816980	Oh shit.
2818080	2818920	Three.
2818920	2820080	How many hit points do you have?
2820080	2821440	Five.
2821440	2822280	Bummer town.
2822280	2824480	All right, you are down to two hit points now.
2825460	2828040	What happens when you run out of hit points?
2828040	2828880	You die.
2828880	2829700	Death.
2829700	2831480	There's no death saving throws.
2831480	2834300	There's no negative hit points.
2834300	2835140	It's not like-
2835140	2836640	No potions can save me.
2836640	2839720	You fall unconscious at one or two hit points
2839720	2843300	if you do not fail a constitution check.
2843300	2846480	So Doreen has two hit points.
2846480	2849720	She is going into shock from blood loss.
2849720	2853320	You have to pass a constitution check
2853320	2855440	or you will fall unconscious
2855440	2858640	and you will still lose a D4 from blood next round.
2862000	2863500	I think I was lost.
2866640	2867480	Let's see.
2869200	2870280	She's like shaking.
2870280	2871920	28 on a 55.
2871920	2873280	That is a success.
2873280	2877440	Doreen Marine can keep her eyes open
2877440	2878920	for a little bit longer.
2880360	2882620	You know, before she fucking dies.
2882620	2884080	It's Dr. Miller's turn.
2884080	2885580	Wouldn't it be Hooch's turn?
2885580	2887520	Hooch, you're on top of Jerome Dyer
2887520	2889600	whose actual turn it is
2889600	2892560	and he is not trying to fight you.
2892560	2897400	He is just laying there and he lets his body go limp.
2897400	2899360	He looks up at you and he says,
2899360	2901200	do you think you're doing a good job?
2901720	2905420	Wow, he got you so good.
2905420	2907920	I don't even acknowledge him.
2907920	2909160	I do get off of him,
2909160	2911240	but I'm just still kind of like pointing my gun
2911240	2912080	in the general
2912080	2914000	or are all three of them kind of in the same area
2914000	2914820	at this point?
2914820	2916160	You are on top of Jerome
2916160	2919120	and you're literally next to a face down,
2919120	2923260	like Carl is now snoring and he's face down,
2923260	2924440	which is impressive.
2924440	2926240	Like that he's still snoring face down.
2926240	2928280	This guy, wow, what a body.
2928320	2932280	And you can hear Janice is sniffling over in the corner.
2932280	2933280	What a goddamn mess.
2933280	2935000	My team is outside.
2935000	2937640	There's a fucking kid on the fucking table.
2937640	2939340	I gotta destroy some of this evidence.
2939340	2941720	Yeah, that's what I'm here to help you do.
2941720	2945280	So I'm still just kind of pointing a gun over in that area.
2945280	2946600	I walk over to the cameras
2946600	2949140	and can I roll computer science
2949140	2950760	to just wipe all the cameras?
2950760	2951600	Yeah.
2951600	2953240	But we have to look at the footage.
2953240	2954320	Nope, I'm wiping them.
2954320	2955160	Oh my God.
2956080	2958560	Wow, fucking rebel scientist.
2958560	2959880	83.
2959880	2963280	83, Jerome notices what you're doing
2963280	2967580	and I don't mean to, you seem very,
2970040	2974160	do you want, I'm, this is, I'm good at,
2974160	2975520	I'm good at this stuff.
2975520	2976520	You're gonna have to prove it
2976520	2978880	because you've done jack shit since we've gotten here.
2978880	2980120	Before you finish the sentence,
2980120	2982320	he's already finished clearing one camera,
2983320	2985920	which literally meant like,
2985920	2989220	he took out the SD card from it and like steps on it.
2990640	2993520	And then he's like, staples.
2993520	2994400	That was easy.
2997240	2998320	I don't like you.
2999280	3000520	That seems clear.
3000520	3002360	Do you want to help me with the rest of these?
3002360	3006240	Janice looks up and is like, who are you?
3006240	3009540	What, how do you, why are you?
3010760	3012060	And he turns around and he's like,
3012660	3015300	well, obviously it wasn't Bigfoot Janice.
3016140	3017500	I just point my gun back at her.
3017500	3019820	I just say, shut the fuck up Janice.
3019820	3020940	I liked Jerome.
3024580	3026980	Dr. Miller, you've already lost your sanity.
3026980	3028860	You can pull your shit together here.
3028860	3031580	You have to save this woman.
3031580	3033900	If you can pass a first aid check,
3033900	3037740	you will stop the bleeding and give her one D4 hit points.
3037740	3041900	Dr. Miller is going to turn around to Chuck and say,
3042580	3043580	you guard that thing with your life.
3043580	3047340	Pointing towards the ice bag that he put the foot in.
3047340	3050500	And then she's going hurriedly trying to stop the bleeding.
3050500	3055260	And Chuck's just like sitting on top of this deep freeze.
3055260	3058940	I'm doing the like surfer sign where you stick your thumb
3058940	3061340	and your pinky out and you shake it.
3061340	3062180	And you shake it.
3062180	3063020	And you shake it.
3063020	3065580	And Dr. Miller says, tubular bra.
3068100	3069060	Righteous.
3069300	3073260	And rolls a 90 fucking five.
3073260	3074100	Oh my God.
3076260	3077500	Sorry, Doreen.
3077500	3078940	Bye Doreen.
3078940	3079780	Bye.
3079780	3081340	Holy shit.
3083740	3086100	Dr. Miller starts fumbling with her things.
3086100	3087540	And she's like, you're going to be all right.
3087540	3088380	You're going to be all right.
3088380	3089540	Okay. You have to survive.
3089540	3091140	Just trust me.
3091140	3091980	Trust me.
3091980	3095900	And you just can't find the exact shit you're looking for.
3095900	3096740	I don't know.
3096740	3097580	I don't know.
3097580	3098580	Like you're looking for gauze.
3099580	3101660	You're looking for anything to like,
3101660	3103700	to maybe burn the, you know,
3103700	3105260	singe the flesh at the bottom
3105260	3107860	to try to cauterize the wound, anything.
3107860	3111700	But you just can't find what you're looking for.
3111700	3115700	Why can't I find anything in this fucking car?
3115700	3117060	Yeah. She starts panicking.
3117060	3120260	And then continues to look at Doreen
3120260	3123540	trying to be like, you're going to be fine, all right?
3123540	3124380	You're going to be fine.
3124380	3125540	Just trust me.
3125540	3127740	Give me one moment.
3127740	3130180	As she continues to look for things,
3130180	3131820	fumbling like a fucking idiot.
3132860	3135260	Like the fucking idiot she is.
3135260	3137660	I didn't mean that, Dr. Miller.
3137660	3138900	I heard that, Chuck.
3140780	3144260	I just like sadly put my surfer hand down.
3147260	3151220	Back inside, Jerome and Dr. Hooch are wrapping up
3151220	3152940	and Jerome is like, okay.
3152980	3156780	And I think we'd uploaded on this laptop here.
3156780	3161780	So Dr. Hooch, you actually see on this laptop,
3162620	3165580	you see some of the pictures that they took
3165580	3168540	and it's the strangest thing.
3168540	3171460	They're all blurry.
3171460	3173860	It'll be like a picture of the two of them
3173860	3176700	throwing up peace signs on either side of the pool table.
3176700	3179300	Like, ah, we got it.
3179300	3183300	There's this like incomprehensible blurry thing
3183300	3184580	on the table.
3184580	3186740	It's almost like there's some sort of cloaking
3186740	3190220	that this creature might have that would make it
3190220	3194340	so that no one could get like a clear picture of it,
3194340	3196580	no matter how good the equipment was,
3196580	3197660	no matter how hard they tried.
3197660	3199740	It's almost like the pictures you've seen
3199740	3201940	of Bigfoot in real life.
3201940	3205140	Why can't anyone get a good picture of Bigfoot?
3205140	3205980	Maybe that's why.
3205980	3207300	Roll sanity.
3208300	3210940	48 on a 53, baby.
3210940	3211780	Success.
3211780	3214060	You're like, damn, I figured out Bigfoot.
3216260	3218180	Okay, are you finished up there?
3218180	3219020	Fuck.
3219020	3220940	Y'all can't hire a fucking photographer
3220940	3222740	that knows how to take a good damn picture?
3222740	3226540	Look, it's like it auto-focused on my face and Carl's face,
3226540	3228740	but it didn't, Jesus.
3228740	3231380	It just seems like no one here knows what y'all are doing.
3231380	3233460	I start like just scrubbing through the photos,
3233460	3235940	frantically trying to see if there's one that's in focus.
3235940	3236900	Not a single one.
3237380	3238220	I just throw my hands up in the air.
3238220	3239540	I'm so frustrated.
3239540	3240940	Where's my fucking team?
3240940	3242500	They all just ran outside.
3242500	3245180	And I open up the front door and just look outside.
3245180	3246700	Yeah, you can smell death.
3246700	3248900	And Chuckster, it's your turn.
3248900	3252380	I'm gonna valiantly take my shirt off.
3253900	3255060	Nice.
3255060	3256180	Hell yeah.
3256180	3259140	But like I could easily just pull it over,
3259140	3260460	you know, and it would come off easily.
3260460	3265140	But instead I like rip it from the collar down.
3265140	3266820	So it like still has like part of it.
3266820	3269540	Like one sleeve is still on, but yeah,
3269540	3271620	there's got a big patch in the front that's off.
3271620	3273060	And I wrap that around her nub.
3273060	3276820	Okay, go ahead and roll first aid to save her life.
3279180	3280340	Not good odds, but.
3282900	3284260	I pass!
3284260	3286100	36 on a 40.
3286100	3287300	I save her.
3287300	3289420	Oh my gosh, the Chuckster is so tight.
3291980	3294460	Doreen reaches up and gives him a little pat on the head.
3294540	3295380	Hold on, let's go back.
3295380	3296820	I mean, you're patting him on the head
3296820	3298180	as he's wrapping this around.
3298180	3301660	And you see Dr. Miller is still just frantically going out.
3301660	3305180	I mean, just like throwing shit out of the cabinets
3305180	3307980	all over behind her, trying to figure this out.
3307980	3310180	You guys are almost like dodging shit
3310180	3311500	that she's throwing out, being like,
3311500	3313180	why can't I find it?
3313180	3314780	Why can't I find it?
3314780	3318580	And you're just like calmly wrapping your torn t-shirt
3318580	3320300	around the nub at the bottom.
3320300	3323980	And I'm giving her little eyebrows, like while I do it.
3324500	3326540	Oh, this is the patch up the soldier moment.
3326540	3328380	Okay, one of you guys.
3328380	3332340	As you're patting his, I mean, roll a D4 please to see.
3333620	3335340	You're able to stop the bleeding,
3335340	3337740	which is the most important thing.
3337740	3341940	And with three hit points back in your system,
3341940	3343740	that takes you back up to five.
3343740	3347100	And you're able to kind of stabilize your breathing.
3347100	3348820	You're still extremely panicked.
3348820	3350820	You're on the verge of throwing up at any moment.
3350820	3352020	You're extremely pale.
3352020	3353660	You've lost a lot of blood.
3354180	3357220	You do not feel well, but you at least have someone
3357220	3359820	who is your fucking savior now.
3360940	3364380	I knew there was a reason I loved you, kid.
3364380	3366420	You do remind me of my whippet.
3366420	3367260	Ha ha ha.
3367260	3368080	Ha ha ha.
3368080	3368920	Ha ha ha.
3368920	3369740	Ha ha ha.
3371740	3373820	This might be too forward,
3373820	3376260	but do you want to celebrate Christmas together?
3377260	3378100	Ha ha ha.
3380380	3381740	It's January.
3381740	3382660	Ha ha ha.
3382700	3386020	Doreen is so happy to have something wrapped around her.
3386020	3388020	She was like, absolutely.
3388020	3388860	Yes.
3388860	3389700	Yes.
3389700	3390540	Yes.
3390540	3391380	Yes.
3391380	3392200	Yes.
3399200	3404620	Searing star, deafening heat.
3404620	3409540	You don't know where you found it.
3409740	3414740	In this heat, as your eyes fall short,
3415380	3420380	you better learn how to keep it.
3440540	3446380	Clasp your fist over all the blood.
3446380	3450860	Water leaks through your fingers.
3450860	3456660	You're standing in a swirling flood.
3456660	3461660	And only darkness leaves.
3469540	3474540	And only darkness leaves.
3482540	3487540	Falling fast into a deep abyss
3488540	3493540	till it's reaching out again.
3493540	3498540	Find your theme on your broken bones.
3498540	3503540	Be your outlaw or he is your king.
3528540	3533540	He is your king.
3559540	3564540	He is your king.
3565540	3570540	He is your king.
3571540	3576540	He is your king.

3589540	3594540	He is your king.
3595540	3600540	He is your king.
3601540	3606540	He is your king.
3607540	3612540	He is your king.
3613540	3618540	He is your king.
3619540	3624540	He is your king.
3625540	3630540	He is your king.
3631540	3636540	He is your king.
3637540	3642540	He is your king.
3643540	3648540	He is your king.
3649540	3654540	He is your king.
3655540	3660540	He is your king.
3661540	3666540	He is your king.
3667540	3672540	He is your king.
3673540	3678540	He is your king.
3679540	3684540	He is your king.
3685540	3690540	He is your king.
3691540	3696540	He is your king.
3697540	3702540	He is your king.
3702540	3707540	He is your king.
