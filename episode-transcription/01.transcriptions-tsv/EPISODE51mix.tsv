0	7600	Greetings, listeners, this is an introduction of myself, Wolf the dog, and this introduction
7600	14940	is introducing itself as hard as it can, live from 694.2 PTBP.
14940	20340	Speaking of meet and greets, we got a new Howlin' with Wolf this week, ain't that special.
20340	27780	It goes, hey there, Crystal, yes, you, coat rack, just keep working and act normal, they'll
27780	34560	know we're talking, they're always watching, where do you think the glowing flamingo really
34560	41420	came from, the kitchen light flashes and cold but I've started to crack it, we'll talk soon,
41420	47820	see you in the car, from Millhouse, hmm, this seems like a message that may not have been
47820	54640	meant for y'alls truly, but y'all, I think the postal service is a lie, so I always open
54640	61600	up anyone's mail I see, it's like I have access to infinite gifts year round, it's
61600	67500	always someone's birthday somewhere and I'm usually in that someone's dumpster when the
67500	75520	mailman goes walking by, happy birthday to me, baby, glowing flamingo do sound pretty

110360	116680	The most recent one is the recently unearthed recording of session zero for this whole damn
116680	122680	campaign in which the town of contention is created and the cast discusses their plans
122680	128720	for the podcast, well, everybody makes plans, but only what actually happens becomes the
128720	130320	news.
130320	138000	As of right before sundown, Liz Lonklin had spoken with a strange rambling man in a clearing
138000	144860	surrounded by sigils in a circle of a white powder before she ran into Ash Hornbeam, arm
144860	151000	still stuck in the tree, coming up with no solution, Ash freaked out and pulled his arm
151000	156440	halfway out, his extreme pain tolerance the only thing keeping him conscious.
156440	161600	Liz bailed to go look for help and she found Jeremy Pettymore and Ken Krenkelhoff with
161600	168120	a naked, bloody, muddy man tied to a tree, Jeremy was feeding him sausage toe beans in
168120	174920	an attempt to calm his new friend he called Rusty, Ken was not on board with this situation.
174920	181040	Judy Krenkelhoff ran off into the woods after losing her shit and calling Shadow a tree,
181040	187240	the two of them almost fell into a pit trap but instead found a rather gregarious raccoon
187240	193680	that charade style told them to avoid the hand sanitizer and to all get the absolute
193680	199760	fuck out of the woods, the three of them walked back to the trailhead where they found Krista
199760	205200	Krenkelhoff in the ranger's shack, she gave Judy more hand sanitizer before the three
205200	211200	came to the conclusion that the best next course of action is for Krista and Shadow
211200	216920	to go back into the woods to find Liz while Judy stays at the ranger's shack with the
216920	224200	raccoon and then Judy Krenkelhoff opened the door to the bathroom and she learned exactly
224200	231200	why it is blue false indigo with moon dance, she runs, the sun is sleeping soon, she knows
254200	270200	she knows she knows that the time has come to dance beneath the dance beneath the shadow
270200	285200	of the moon.
285200	290440	You guys are walking through the woods looking for Ash Hornbeam who Liz has told you has
290440	298600	his arm stuck in a tree and the sun goes down behind the trees of the woods and you are
298600	306200	now walking through total darkness, you are not on the path of the trail any longer because
306200	312820	that is not where Ash Hornbeam resides in the mind of Liz Lonklin and as you're walking
312820	319920	through you all begin to realize that you have no fucking clue where you are or where
319920	323960	you're going.
323960	330440	Rusty no, Rusty, you eat smokies but don't bite the fingers, leave my fingers alone.
330440	334480	He's looking at your fingers and like doing that thing where he wraps his lips around
334480	341800	your fingertips like a horse might looking for a carrot, see I feed him palm down from
341800	348880	now on, palm up like you do a horse and then he immediately like looks over at Ken Krenkelhoff
348880	358360	and like yeah, he's being a turd, huh?
358360	362600	I pick up my pace ahead of that.
362600	365200	Liz you said he was this way, where is he?
365200	369900	I don't know, I swear to god he was just over here like just over around this corner.
369900	375960	And as you guys pass that corner you see that amongst these trees you can make it out in
375960	382240	the moonlight, it happens to be not a full moon but like so close to a full moon that
382240	386040	you might be like that's a full moon but then you look it up and you're like it wasn't a
386040	387040	full moon.
387040	388040	Yeah it's just waning.
388040	392280	Does this ever happen to you where you think it's a full moon and you say oh that's a full
392280	395840	moon and someone corrects you because they know when the full moon is?
395840	399520	No but I correct people because you can just fucking look and see when it's a circle or
399520	400520	not.
400520	404720	Sometimes it's really close to a circle.
404720	412120	So this moonlight is shining down and ahead of you you see glinting from the moonlight
412120	418360	is a frame like of a painting and it's hanging from a tree.
418360	422400	Let's just turn around y'all, fuck that.
422400	425320	What if we just went the other way immediately?
425320	430960	And with that I'm gonna need Thomas and Lindsay to leave the room.
434720	443920	Hey Joe.
443920	448360	Hey Zach.
448360	451480	We're gonna cut to a quick flashback here.
451480	452560	Oh boy.
452560	460280	It's a couple years ago and it also happens to be the evening that Kane Krinklehoff, Ash
460280	464660	Hornbeam, and Jeremy Pettymore are out in the woods.
464660	466340	Looking for Madge.
466340	467860	Simpler happier times.
467860	468860	Of course.
468860	472460	You actually felt one when you were with him.
472460	476220	They were, they're my buds.
476220	482340	The look in your eyes when you say that is so like nostalgia killing.
482340	489580	Kane Krinklehoff pops away to go pee, finds a spot in the woods, behind a tree, something
489580	491060	else that rhymes.
492020	501340	As you're looking up from your stream of urine, you see the frame of a painting hanging in
501340	503980	the woods.
503980	506620	Can I make out what is within the frame?
506620	507820	How far away is it from me?
507820	514660	It's about 25 yards away from you and you can see that it looks as if there is nothing
514660	515900	within the frame.
515900	519180	You see the trees on the other side.
519220	525740	I'm going to approach it a little bit, that's weird, who put a frame out here in the woods?
525740	528380	Go ahead and roll alertness for me.
532860	536700	I pass a 27 on a 50.
536700	543300	Kane Krinklehoff notices that somewhere around the edge of the frame, something doesn't line
543300	544300	up.
544420	549020	It looks almost as if what's behind this frame that's hanging isn't the same as what you
549020	550340	can see through it.
550340	557780	And so you move to the side and you walk, you strafe, is that how you say that word?
557780	558780	You straffy.
558780	566820	When I was a kid, I always said straffy because I didn't, I didn't, I was a fucking idiot.
566820	578060	You slam and as you walk to the side, you see that beyond this frame is a cabin sitting
578060	580020	in the woods.
580020	583720	Ken wants to push his hand through the frame, can he?
583720	586580	Go ahead and roll a survival check for me.
586580	590060	Oh fuck, that's a fatal mistake.
590060	591060	What's your survival?
591060	592060	A 50.
592060	595620	I pass a 24 on a 50.
595620	604220	As you approach the frame, you make a misstep and your foot is about to land on a wire.
604220	608720	There's a wire that is going across the ground that's right in front of the frame and you
608720	614100	almost step right on it and you see it's connected to like a stake in the ground and then it
614100	616820	goes off to a tree and ties off.
616820	618060	Oh shit.
618060	622340	Okay, I want to abort my mission of the hand through the painting and I want to step back
622340	627540	and grab a branch or a rock, anything that's nearby and try and toss it in from where I'm
627540	628540	standing.
628540	635940	You toss it onto the wire and a giant wooden spear comes flying through the canvas of this
635940	642420	painting and strikes directly into a tree that is five feet away from you and you think
642420	646900	if you would have been standing there when you stepped on this wire, you would have gotten
646900	652140	a face full of splinters and probably a back of the head full of splinters as well.
652140	656080	And it came out of the frame, like I couldn't tell where it came from.
656080	658940	You couldn't, but it busted through the frame.
658940	662340	Go ahead and roll a retroactive sanity.
662340	663340	Yeah.
663340	671260	I fail a 78 on a 34.
671260	674960	What's going through your mind as you race back to your campsite?
674960	675960	It can't be real.
675960	676960	It can't be real.
676960	682480	I've just not gotten enough sleep tonight and it doesn't exist.
700480	705100	Jeremy Pettymore, Liz Lonklin, and Ken Krenkelhoff.
705100	713100	As well as this large, bloody, muddy man who is at the end of Jeremy Pettymore's rope.
713100	714100	Rusty.
714100	715100	Rusty.
715100	716100	I'm so sorry.
716100	717100	Rusty.
717100	723540	Are all standing in this clearing looking at this frame that is glinting in the moonlight.
723540	724540	Jeremy!
724540	725540	Elizabeth stop!
725540	726540	Yeah, don't stop.
726540	727540	Okay.
727540	728540	Don't.
728540	729540	Go.
729540	730540	Near it.
730540	731540	You recognize that frame?
731980	735020	I didn't, I didn't, I didn't think it was real.
735020	741300	I didn't think it was, I just thought I was, just hadn't had enough sleep that night.
741300	745520	It's, look, and I point at the thing on the ground.
745520	752300	Looking down where Ken Krenkelhoff is pointing, you see that right before this frame that's
752300	758840	hanging there is a trip wire on the ground tied to a stake in the ground and the other
758840	761900	end of the wire goes to a tree that is nearby.
761900	767360	So they wanted to distract us with the frame and trip us up with the wire.
767360	768360	Stand back, stand back.
768360	770920	And I push them where I know it is a safe place.
770920	772320	Rusty, come here boy, come on.
772320	775680	And I go ahead and throw a log and show them.
775680	784160	When Ken Krenkelhoff throws a small log onto this trip wire, a long wooden spear flies
784160	791200	through the canvas of the frame and directly into a tree 10 feet away from you guys.
791200	793080	Whoa, that was cool.
793080	795600	Holy shit.
795600	796600	That was awesome, Ken.
796600	799360	How'd you know it would do that?
799360	808200	I, a couple of years ago, I was, I had to pee and I came over here to pee and I saw,
808200	810520	I saw it then.
810520	811520	I didn't think it was real.
811760	814280	I didn't, I didn't, I just pushed it out of my memory.
814280	816680	I didn't, but it's real.
816680	817680	It's there.
817680	818680	You guys see it, right?
818680	824560	The painting, the frame there where the giant spear came through the canvas.
824560	831240	You now see there's a cabin in the woods on the other side of the frame.
831240	832240	Oh my God, Zach.
832240	833240	That's already a movie.
833240	835240	I think it's a lot of movies.
835240	836240	Did you not know?
836240	838560	Zach, that's a name of a literal movie.
838560	839560	Wait, what?
839600	840600	There's a movie called.
840600	841600	Fucking beautiful idiot.
841600	842600	Cabin in the woods.
842600	843600	That's a very popular movie.
843600	845600	Are there any eldritch gods in it?
845600	846600	I think so, yeah.
846600	847600	Actually, kind of.
847600	848600	Oh, fuck.
848600	851400	I think that's like the whole deal.
851400	852800	If you want to start over, we can.
852800	853800	Let's just go back.
853800	854800	This is so embarrassing for you.
854800	857120	Do you guys want to make middle schoolers this time?
857120	858120	Sure.
858120	859120	Yes.
859120	860120	You'd like that.
860120	861120	Gah, again?
861120	865920	Oh, it's super cool when you do that.
865920	868040	It makes me feel good.
869040	872040	No, it makes me feel good.
872040	873040	Oh.
873040	874040	Got him.
874040	875040	FBI.
875040	876040	Come on, inside.
876040	877040	Got him.
877040	878040	Ew.
878040	880040	Busting makes me feel good.
880040	882040	Busting makes me feel good.
882040	883040	Oh, that was good.
883040	887040	Busting makes me feel good.
887040	888040	Sorry.
888040	889040	All together now.
889040	892040	Busting makes me feel good.
892040	893040	It's all about ghosts now.
893040	895040	It's middle schoolers and ghosts.
896040	901200	Hey, Jeremy Pettymore, how do you feel about the fact that Ken saw something out in the
901200	904560	woods a couple years ago and didn't say anything to you?
904560	908040	Jeremy is probably just a little too excited by all this.
908040	914040	And if he really processed it, he'd put one and two together and he'd be like, what the
914040	915040	fuck, man?
915040	919040	But right now, he's very much in the moment.
919040	923040	You're the treasure hunter who has found a chest at the bottom of a hole.
923040	926040	Yeah, of course this woods is full of freaky frames.
926040	927040	Freaky frames?
927040	928040	Cabins in the woods?
928040	932040	I grab Jeremy, I grab him and kind of move him to show him that there's no cabin over
932040	933040	there.
933040	934040	It's just when you look through here.
934040	935040	Nope.
935040	936040	Oh, that's not the case?
936040	940040	When you look through on the other side this time, there is a cabin.
940040	942040	Oh, that freaks Ken out.
942040	943040	Go ahead and roll sanity for me.
943040	945040	There's obviously a cabin there, dude.
945040	946040	It wasn't there.
946040	948040	It wasn't there.
948040	950040	I fail hard.
950040	952040	A 93 on a 34.
952040	957040	Go ahead and roll a D6 for me.
957040	959040	Oh, boy.
959040	960040	Oh, boy.
960040	961040	A five.
961040	962040	Yeah.
962040	965040	That's what I wanted to happen.
965040	967040	So, you lose five sanity.
967040	968040	Go down to 29.
968040	969040	What the fuck?
969040	971040	Oh, we hit a lot, relatively.
971040	975040	And we're playing a slightly different sanity mechanic for this game.
975040	981040	It's come through a couple of times, maybe just once earlier, but you have not seen it.
981040	983040	We're going to do bouts of insanity.
983040	987040	Do you remember earlier in one of our other campaigns, maybe both of them, what I would
987040	991040	have you do is rank fight, flight, and feint.
991040	992040	Oh, yeah.
992040	995040	From most likely to least likely for your character.
995040	997040	So, which would be most likely?
997040	998040	Flight.
998040	1000040	And next would be?
1000040	1001040	Fight.
1001040	1002040	And the third would be?
1002040	1003040	Feint.
1003040	1004040	All right.
1004040	1009040	So, if you roll a one, two, or three, you will flight.
1009040	1012040	If you roll a four or a five, you will fight.
1012040	1016040	And if you roll a six, you will feint.
1016040	1017040	It's a four.
1017040	1019040	That's a fight, baby.
1019040	1020040	What?
1020040	1021040	Oh, God.
1021040	1022040	So, here's what I'm thinking.
1022040	1025040	You just start punching that cabin.
1025040	1026040	Yeah.
1026040	1027040	Dump cabin.
1027040	1031040	I don't know exactly what you look for in a fight response, but could I like maybe grab
1031040	1033040	the spear and be ready to fight?
1033040	1036040	Like, I'm amped and stoked to be doing damage now.
1036040	1041040	Not only are you going to grab the spear and be stoked to do damage now, but also flight
1041040	1042040	was going to be run away.
1042040	1045040	So, fight is going to be run toward.
1045040	1049040	We got to kill this cabin.
1049040	1053040	And why do you hate some home so much?
1053040	1054040	Someone built that with their hands.
1054040	1055040	They lived there.
1055040	1056040	They lived there for all we know.
1056040	1058040	It didn't used to be there.
1058040	1060040	Lindsey, what is Liz Conklin doing?
1060040	1065040	Liz Lonklin, first of all, how dare you, is she's just confused.
1065040	1067040	She's like, it's a cabin.
1067040	1069040	Why is it that crazy that there's a cabin there?
1069040	1071040	I'm sure that person that lives there put this frame there.
1071040	1072040	I don't know.
1072040	1077040	It just seems to me like somebody's being a douche who's trying to keep me from performing
1077040	1079040	voodoo on the girl that I'm-
1079040	1081040	Out here to perform voodoo on.
1081040	1082040	Yeah.
1082040	1085040	Damn, she has such a cooler reason for being in the woods than us.
1085040	1086040	I'm just pissed.
1086040	1089040	Why the fuck am I here with these fucking freshmen right now?
1089040	1094040	It's just a spell written by Fufuzuzu Voodoo is a book they found in the library.
1094040	1096040	Jeremy Pennymore, what are you doing?
1096040	1098040	Ken, wait, hold up.
1098040	1099040	Come on, Rusty.
1099040	1100040	I follow after him.
1100040	1102040	Can't stop, got to fight.
1102040	1104040	Can't stop, got to fight might be your last words.
1104040	1109040	Roll an alertness check at a negative 40 for being insane.
1109040	1112040	I was going to say that there might be more traps, but I was running.
1112040	1113040	Yeah, there might be.
1113040	1114040	What am I rolling?
1114040	1116040	Alertness at negative 40.
1116040	1117040	At negative 40.
1117040	1120040	For being absolutely out of your mind.
1120040	1121040	Absolute fail.
1121040	1122040	It's a 76.
1122040	1129040	And you run directly into a pile of leaves on the ground that is not a pile of leaves
1129040	1130040	on the ground.
1130040	1133040	It's a motherfucking pit trap.
1133040	1142040	And I need, once again, Thomas and Lindsay to leave the room.
1142040	1143040	Don't worry, guys.
1143040	1144040	I'm going to get out of it.
1144040	1145040	Busting makes me feel good.
1145040	1147040	Busting makes me feel good.
1147040	1148040	Busting.
1148040	1151040	You guys actually see him as he's running.
1151040	1157040	You just fucking, he's on your level and then he's not anymore.
1157040	1175040	Leaves papa behind.
1175040	1180040	Ash Hornbeam, you're standing in the middle of the woods.
1180040	1188040	No fucking clue direction wise where you are from anything in the contention woods.
1188040	1193040	Your arm is halfway in the hollow of a tree.
1193040	1195040	We figured it out.
1195040	1197040	I looked it up while I was editing that episode.
1197040	1203040	I looked it up literally like three days ago because I was like, what is a knot but not
1203040	1204040	a knot?
1204040	1205040	Not a knot.
1205040	1206040	Well, I looked it up.
1206040	1213040	It's a hollow and we both used the word hollow within 30 seconds of not knowing what it is.
1213040	1214040	Okay.
1214040	1215040	Well, perfect.
1215040	1220040	Your arm is halfway into this hollow of this tree.
1220040	1229040	The rest of your arm that you can see up to your elbow is muscle and a thin layer of membrane
1229040	1231040	that is, what's it called?
1231040	1232040	What's in between muscle?
1232040	1235040	You were in nursing school for like four months.
1235040	1239040	Well, between your, I mean, there's like layers of skin and then your muscle.
1239040	1241040	What's that sin you called the white stuff?
1241040	1242040	Aphasia.
1242040	1243040	Aphasia.
1243040	1244040	No.
1244040	1245040	Fascia.
1245040	1246040	F-A-C-I-A.
1246040	1247040	F-A.
1247040	1248040	Yeah.
1248040	1249040	Fascia.
1249040	1250040	Fascia.
1250040	1251040	Fascia.
1251040	1252040	Doesn't matter.
1252040	1253040	Let's move on.
1253040	1254040	It's not like that would have been ripped away.
1254040	1255040	It would not be there.
1255040	1257040	Like the brine of an orange or the pith.
1257040	1258040	I mean, so.
1258040	1259040	Oh yeah.
1259040	1260040	Ew.
1260040	1261040	Gross.
1261040	1262040	You can see this juice.
1262040	1263040	Think about that.
1263040	1264040	This juice of your arm.
1264040	1269040	Think about a blood orange that you didn't really take the peel off of very well.
1269040	1276040	And the sun goes down behind the trees in the distance.
1276040	1281040	And you are standing all alone in moonlight.
1281040	1285040	I really don't know where to go from here.
1285040	1288040	You hear a branch crack in the distance.
1288040	1290040	Someone is nearby.
1290040	1293040	I wait silently.
1293040	1295040	What's bothering you is a man.
1295040	1300040	He's wearing a black suit, a white shirt, and a bolo tie.
1300040	1303040	He is in his late 20s, early 30s maybe.
1303040	1307040	He has a very, very bitchin' mustache.
1307040	1308040	He's pretty fit.
1308040	1311040	His pants are a little too tight.
1311040	1316040	And he flashes an FBI badge as he approaches.
1316040	1317040	Name's Agent Kevin.
1317040	1322040	I need you to tell me what you're up to with your arm stuck in this tree out here in the
1322040	1323040	woods.
1323040	1326040	Ash just looks down at his arm.
1326040	1329040	A tear rolls out of his eye.
1329040	1330040	Just help me.
1330040	1331040	I'm here to help.
1331040	1333040	I need a little bit of information before I can help you.
1333040	1335040	My arm is stuck.
1335040	1336040	Why?
1336040	1337040	Because I put it in here.
1337040	1339040	Why can't you get it out?
1339040	1342040	It feels like there's barbs in here.
1342040	1346040	And the more I pull out, the more skin gets ripped off.
1346040	1349040	I just, I don't know what to do.
1349040	1355040	He pulls some cloth out of one of his pockets, and he wraps it around your arm, if you're
1355040	1356040	willing.
1356040	1357040	Whatever you want to do.
1357040	1362040	So he begins, he has some ointment that he puts on your arm, and then he wraps a cloth
1362040	1366040	around it, and he's like, that should help start the bleeding for now a little bit, but
1366040	1367040	I need some more information.
1367040	1369040	What were you doing out here in the woods?
1369040	1371040	You know there's people missing, right?
1371040	1372040	I know, I gotta...
1372040	1374040	Why'd you decide to become one of them?
1374040	1382040	It hurts me a little bit, but I kind of pull my arm away from the tree, and I let the light
1382040	1387040	shine out, and I just point to it, and I look at him with wide eyes.
1387040	1389040	Yeah, that's wild.
1389040	1390040	That's not an answer, though.
1390040	1392040	Why'd you come out to the woods, anyway, in the first place?
1392040	1401040	Well, we come out here, me and a couple of friends, we come out here every year, and
1401040	1403040	we just camp.
1403040	1406040	I was just trying to camp, but we found...
1406040	1408040	You decided to camp when there were people missing in the woods?
1408040	1411040	You decided to come out here and camp, anyway?
1411040	1412040	Doesn't seem very smart.
1412040	1415040	I'm in high school.
1415040	1416040	I see that.
1416040	1417040	I didn't think through...
1417040	1424040	I wasn't going to stop camping every year if people are missing.
1424040	1425040	I don't...
1425040	1426040	I'm invincible.
1426040	1430040	Roll a persuade.
1430040	1433040	He's going to roll human against you.
1433040	1436040	49 on a 50.
1436040	1440040	I rolled a 69, which in our house rules is a critical success.
1440040	1443040	Is a critical success.
1443040	1445040	You're not telling me the whole truth, son.
1445040	1446040	I can see it in your eyes.
1446040	1447040	Something scared you.
1447040	1450040	You knew about something like this before you came out here.
1450040	1451040	What's your deal?
1451040	1453040	We come out here every year to find something.
1453040	1455040	We haven't found it yet, but...
1455040	1456040	What are you looking for?
1456040	1458040	I don't know if I can tell you.
1458040	1464040	You have to trust me or you're going to die tonight.
1464040	1468040	Ash looks down at his arm and he sees the first aid, basically.
1468040	1469040	Sure.
1469040	1475040	What this guy has done to him and he looks up at the FBI.
1475040	1477040	He says, I'm looking for Madge.
1477040	1478040	Who's Madge?
1478040	1485040	It's just a while back we heard about a woman in the woods and at first it was just kind
1485040	1491040	of an excuse to come out and camp every year, but every year we started believing in it
1491040	1499040	a little more and with all this stuff going on, I think I finally believe it.
1499040	1502040	And we're out here looking for her.
1502040	1504040	I got a couple friends.
1504040	1508040	Two of my buddies are, I don't know where they are now.
1508040	1513040	I don't know where I am, but I came with them.
1513040	1515040	Alright, well...
1515040	1517040	Shit.
1521040	1522040	Alright.
1522040	1524040	Thank you.
1524040	1532040	And he walks up behind you and you feel the metal of a gun up against the back of your head
1532040	1534040	and his hand is trembling.
1534040	1536040	An instinct kicks in.
1536040	1538040	His left arm, which is...
1538040	1540040	His right arm is in the tree.
1540040	1545040	His left arm reaches into his pocket, pulls out a lighter and then he reaches in to his
1545040	1552040	inside of his jacket, pulls out a handful of firecrackers and in one quick motion lights
1552040	1558040	the lighter, lighting five or six firecrackers.
1558040	1564040	He reaches behind him and he holds the firecrackers on this guy's head, knowing that his hand
1564040	1569040	is going to get hurt, holds the lit firecrackers on this guy's head and waits for them to explode.
1570040	1571040	Alright!
1571040	1578040	I'm going to go ahead and roll some dice here to see what Agent Kevin decides to do.
1578040	1585040	As soon as you do that, he pulls the gun back down, grabs the firecrackers in your hand
1585040	1592040	and he throws them with your hand and then he stands up in front of you face to face.
1592040	1594040	Alright, you're a fighter.
1594040	1596040	We could actually use another set of hands.
1596040	1599040	Well, I guess maybe just one will do.
1599040	1600040	I'll be back.
1600040	1607040	Ash kind of chuckles because he gets the little joke that this FBI agent made.
1607040	1612040	He reaches back into his jacket and stares him in the eye.
1612040	1618040	The tiny explosion happens from these fireworks that you guys have thrown off away from you
1618040	1622040	and he turns back and looks at you with this wry smile.
1622040	1625040	You look familiar.
1625040	1631040	You're that kid from around here who had the troubles with them robbers, yeah?
1631040	1633040	Yeah, that's me.
1633040	1635040	And you fought them off, didn't you?
1635040	1637040	Oh yeah, real good.
1637040	1639040	I knew you were a fighter.
1639040	1641040	How'd you do that?
1641040	1646040	I pulled a lot of pranks, kind of used my past knowledge of pranks that usually were harmless
1646040	1650040	but I added a little element to them to do some harm.
1650040	1653040	Yeah, we're going to need some thinking like that for tonight.
1653040	1656040	Well, I'll come with you if you can get me out of this tree.
1656040	1659040	And then we flash back into the history.
1659040	1667040	The pages on the book turn backwards as this, you know, fluttering music happens behind us
1667040	1674040	and we travel back into time when Ash Hornbeam is an even younger boy
1674040	1677040	and we see the front of the Hornbeam home.
1677040	1679040	What kind of house do the Hornbeams have?
1679040	1683040	It's like a two story, just kind of like Victorian.
1683040	1686040	And right there on the front steps we see Ash Hornbeam.
1686040	1692040	He's wearing one of those like crisis blankets and he's got some hot cocoa in his hands
1692040	1697040	and there's an officer from the contention police force there talking to him.
1697040	1703040	Now, Mr. Hornbeam, what was it? What time did this all begin this evening?
1703040	1712040	I started hearing some noises in my basement around 5.30.
1712040	1717040	Around 5.30, okay. And what kind of voices were these?
1717040	1722040	I think it was two voices, maybe three, but I'm pretty sure two men's voices.
1722040	1725040	Two men's voices, okay. And did you get a good look at these men?
1725040	1731040	Not a great look, but one was tall and skinny and one was short and fat.
1731040	1733040	Classic two man robbery team.
1733040	1734040	Mm-hmm, trench coats.
1734040	1739040	What is it that they seem to have been looking for and or have stolen?
1739040	1745040	Well, I think they were after, my dad's got a real big coin collection that's pretty well known.
1745040	1750040	He takes them to coin shows and shows them off and he's got some real valuable stuff down there.
1750040	1753040	He keeps them locked up in the basement.
1753040	1755040	Locked up in the basement, okay.
1755040	1763040	And then we flash back to Ash Hornbeam in his home all alone a few hours earlier.
1763040	1770040	Ash Hornbeam is home alone watching TV and he sees an ad, made for TV ad kind of thing,
1770040	1776040	for something he really wants to buy. It was like a CD player, I think, that he wanted.
1776040	1777040	Three disc changer.
1777040	1781040	Three disc changer for how much it cost. His allowance was not going to pay for it.
1781040	1786040	So he hatched an idea to try to get into those coins.
1786040	1787040	Get into the coins?
1787040	1793040	Yeah, to get into the lockbox the coins were in so that he could sell them and buy that new CD player.
1793040	1795040	So how did he pull this off?
1795040	1802040	He kind of rummaged through his parents' room. He didn't know the code to it, but looking for maybe clues of what it could be.
1802040	1806040	He didn't really find anything, so he went down there and just started typing in birthdays.
1806040	1807040	And eventually?
1807040	1808040	It was my birthday.
1808040	1810040	Aw, your parents love you so much.
1810040	1812040	Yep, and I'm taking their stuff.
1812040	1820040	So there was in the lockbox the entire coin collection valued at $40,000.
1820040	1824040	Yeah, some real nice stuff. And then a handgun.
1824040	1829040	He knows which ones were more valuable, so he just took a handful, not the whole thing.
1829040	1831040	He didn't need $40,000.
1831040	1835040	But he takes about $600 worth of coins.
1835040	1838040	And then we flash back to this officer talking to you.
1838040	1844040	And he's like, so we walked through the house and we saw there's just a mess all over the place.
1844040	1848040	I mean, you got paint cans that are hanging from strings.
1848040	1854040	You know, when I heard them down in there I figured, you know, I gotta defend myself and get them out of here.
1854040	1861040	So yeah, I found some paint cans in the garage and some hammers and tied strings to them.
1862040	1866040	I learned how to do a trip wire when I was in the Boy Scouts.
1866040	1873040	So I did that by the stairs and when they were coming up I threw marbles down the stairs and they fell down and then they were mad.
1873040	1875040	So they were coming after me.
1875040	1884040	And then, yeah, the first one, the tall one, he tripped the first wire and the paint bucket swaying right into his face covered him with that paint that's all over the ground.
1884040	1889040	And then the second one came up, the shorter one came up and the other trip wire.
1889040	1896040	Yeah, the second trip wire that I did, the hammers came and whacked him on either side of the head and he fell back down and got paint all over him.
1896040	1900040	And then I yelled that I was going to call the police and that I had a gun.
1900040	1904040	And then, yeah, then I called you guys.
1904040	1911040	And then the front door swings open and walking out is another police officer from contention.
1911040	1914040	And the first one that you're talking to is like, no, no, no, hold on.
1914040	1922040	And before he can stop him, a bucket falls down on the top of this guy's head and he's like, oh no.
1922040	1926040	Yeah, it was a bucket that I had made that goo stuff out of.
1926040	1931040	But it went all over him and the buckets on his head so he can't see anything.
1931040	1933040	He walks into the wall and falls down.
1933040	1938040	And I'm like, well, you know, they must have gone out the back door because I set that one up for the front door.
1938040	1945040	Okay, well, we're going to talk to your parents and then we'll have a report written up and we'll see if we can find these fellas.
1945040	1950040	Yeah, I said one, they're both tall. They were both tall.
1950040	1953040	Okay, so the short fat one was tall.
1953040	1955040	He wasn't as tall. That's why I said short.
1955040	1958040	Less tall, still tall. Okay.
1958040	1961040	One was ugly. The other one was even uglier.
1961040	1963040	Well, the most important thing is that-
1963040	1964040	And a beard.
1964040	1965040	Oh, he's got a beard too.
1965040	1966040	Yeah.
1966040	1969040	Okay, well, this is really narrowing it down.
1969040	1973040	Well, the most important thing I believe is that you feel safe here.
1973040	1977040	Yeah, I think I've got to unbuby trap the rest of the house.
1977040	1979040	So don't go walking upstairs or anything.
1979040	1982040	But yeah, I feel safe now.
1982040	1984040	I think I can defend myself.
1984040	1986040	I think my parents are on their way back home too.
1986040	1987040	Hey, Luke.
1987040	1988040	Yeah.
1988040	1990040	Did you get that three disc CD player?
1990040	1991040	Yeah, he's got it.
1991040	1994040	He carries it everywhere he goes.
1994040	1996040	He's got Def Leppard on there.
1996040	2000040	Of course. Def Leppard's really fitting.
2000040	2004040	He's got Def Leppard. He's got Ramone's album.
2004040	2006040	And then he's got a Madonna album in it too.
2006040	2009040	Yeah, that's very important.
2009040	2011040	Fucking Def Leppard.
2011040	2015040	Alrighty, cutting back to present day or whatever your present day is.
2015040	2020040	Cutting back to Ash Hornbeam with his arm stuck halfway into the hollow of this tree.
2020040	2023040	This man's smile fades as he turns.
2023040	2028040	Agent Kevin walks away from you back into the darkness of the woods.
2028040	2035040	Ash stands there dumbfounded, wishing that that would have been a rescue.
2035040	2046040	But he looks back down at his arm, looks at the tree, and just punches it with his left arm and looks down and defeat.
2050040	2066040	Ash Hornbeam, you're standing still halfway the forearm out of this tree.
2066040	2074040	And you see from the direction where Agent Kevin walked away, he's walking back and there's another figure with him.
2074040	2078040	And as they come into focus, you see that it is a woman.
2078040	2088040	She is wearing a black suit, a white shirt, black tie, and she is holding a machete that is glinting in the moonlight.
2088040	2098040	And as she's walking toward you, you can hear she is chanting while she rubs one of her hands over this blade.
2098040	2109040	And as she gets closer, you see she is smiling a cold, vacant smile behind asymmetrical bangs that are covering one of her eyes.
2109040	2113040	And the two of them finally get up to you.
2113040	2121040	As they approach, he doesn't want to do it, but Ash just instinctually winks at them.
2121040	2130040	Finger guns with his free arm and the hand that is stuck inside of the tree also finger guns.
2130040	2138040	Ash winces a little bit from using his muscles in the tree. It kind of digs in just a little bit.
2138040	2145040	But the wink and the free hand finger gun make up for the pain.
2145040	2148040	Please don't make me roll.
2149040	2154040	In two quick movements, Agent Kevin says, this is Agent Karen.
2154040	2161040	And she lifts this machete that is glinting in the moonlight over her head and she brings it down swiftly right at your forearm.
2161040	2169040	And you step back away from the tree and immediately out of shock reaction, you look at your forearm.
2169040	2175040	And not only is the end of it completely cauterized, but it starts to grow back.
2175040	2182040	And your forearm literally remolds itself into this kind of long stump at the end.
2182040	2188040	So you don't have your hand, there's just this kind of long stump, but it's still this well-formed skin.
2188040	2195040	And then from halfway up your forearm to about your wrist, it's still raw and red.
2195040	2198040	And like, you know, you can see the muscle and tissue and stuff.
2198040	2201040	She says absolutely nothing.
2201040	2206040	She just like smiles at you and then turns around and starts walking the other way.
2206040	2208040	Agent Kevin throws his arm around you.
2208040	2215040	All right, we're going to need some more of that firecracker hand quickness, triggery fingers where we're going.
2215040	2225040	And he leads you along with Agent Karen to a black sedan sitting next to a four-wheeler in the middle of the woods.
2225040	2234040	And you can see through some of the brush and trees, there is a cabin and it's a stakeout, baby.
2234040	2236040	Hell yeah.
2236040	2262040	Taylor, Shadow, Sharon Berryman, if you will, is walking down the trail of the contention woods with Krista, the Krinklehoff matriarch.
2262040	2265040	And I believe she was singing a song about death.
2265040	2269040	Death is all around us, et cetera.
2269040	2274040	Et cetera. And Krista is like not having any of it.
2274040	2281040	She's like folded arms walking and the sun goes down behind the trees in the distance.
2281040	2291040	And she pulls out a flashlight and begins leading the two of you on this dirt path of roots and rocks and only lit by the light of a flashlight.
2291040	2295040	And then, oh, oh my goodness. Do you see that?
2295040	2302040	And she points the flashlight over to the side like in the thick of the woods and she points the flashlight out there.
2302040	2305040	She's like, oh, is that Liz?
2305040	2313040	Krista immediately takes off into the brush of the woods with the flashlight kind of bouncing off these trees.
2313040	2316040	Total darkness except for the moonlight and this flashlight.
2316040	2322040	I run after her giggling because I see no importance in any of this and I'm having a great time.
2322040	2333040	Yeah, absolutely. You've got the things dangling from your hands and you're like waving them back and forth and just kind of like whimsically running through the trees.
2333040	2342040	And so since you don't care, I'm going to have you roll your alertness at negative 40 as you just put no effort into running through all these woods.
2342040	2344040	What's your alertness normally?
2344040	2345040	40.
2345040	2351040	Oh, bummer town. So you have a zero. So, uh, let's see if you, if you roll an art one, that's a success.
2351040	2356040	And if you, your dice matches a crit fail, so go ahead and roll those dice.
2356040	2359040	Excellent odds.
2359040	2361040	Nine 95.
2361040	2363040	All right, so that is a fail.
2363040	2371040	And you see the flashlight go completely dark as you feel a rope tighten around your ankle.
2371040	2384040	And in this moonlit darkness, you lose control of your body and you lose your bearings completely as this rope hoists you up into the air upside down, hanging by one foot.
2384040	2401040	The blood immediately begins rushing to your head and a bright light blinds you momentarily before Krista Krinklehoff turns the flashlight on herself under her chin like it's spooky story time.
2401040	2412040	My darling, it is certifiably unfortunate that your demise is seemingly necessary, despite my finding your demeanor so appropriate for your kind.
2412040	2420040	From your personal hems, I can assume and do hope that a lack of existence is your preference.
2420040	2425040	And then I whispered to myself, finally.
2426040	2435040	And you see a long silver tendril grows from the back of Krista Krinklehoff's neck.
2435040	2444040	Then another, then another and another as the limbs extend toward your pinata like hanging body.
2444040	2453040	The camera pans down to watch the long shadows play out this grizzly scene on the detritus below.
2453040	2459040	One of the shiny tentacles slices into the soft tissue on the back of your neck.
2459040	2481040	Another snaps your head forward and you feel the fracture as a third reaches in gripping the top of your spine and it rips your entire spinal cord down out of your body in one swift motion, promptly delivering you to your lack of a destination.
2481040	2485040	And you feel nothing.
2502040	2505040	Allie, you just told me something horrifying about your mom.
2505040	2512040	I did. She used to hide under my bed and when I would run out from the bathroom at night, she would reach out and grab my ankle.
2512040	2515040	That is wholly fucked up.
2515040	2517040	It is so bad.
2518040	2536040	So just imagine that feeling inside that you have like when your ankle would get grabbed is the exact horror that you feel as you're standing at the entrance of this bathroom that is attached to this shack at the trailhead of the contention woods.
2536040	2544040	And the sun goes down and it's dark outside and it starts to rain behind you.
2544040	2554040	Looking ahead, you see this body that is crumpled, folded even, wearing the state trooper uniform.
2554040	2561040	And the body is Buzz Woodrow, if you will, and it is lifeless.
2561040	2565040	So do you have forensics or SIGINT?
2565040	2567040	I have a 20 in SIGINT.
2567040	2569040	Oh yeah, go ahead and roll that.
2569040	2571040	Okay.
2571040	2573040	I got a 20.
2573040	2576040	No way. That's incredible. That's a success.
2576040	2577040	Oh yay. Good.
2577040	2587040	Yeah. So you can tell looking around this bathroom, there was a tussle in here and you're like Sherlock Holmesing around the place.
2587040	2594040	And what is something small from Krista Krinklehoff's purse?
2594040	2597040	Something small. Chapstick?
2597040	2607040	You see the exact brand of chapstick your mother, Krista Krinklehoff uses, has rolled behind the toilet of this place.
2607040	2609040	Oh my god.
2609040	2611040	Go ahead and roll sanity for me.
2611040	2613040	I got a 14 on a 32.
2613040	2615040	That is also a success.
2615040	2617040	Wait, you had a 32 in first aid?
2617040	2618040	No, you said sanity.
2618040	2620040	Oh, I did say sanity?
2620040	2621040	Do you mean first aid?
2621040	2623040	How'd you do that?
2623040	2631040	No, so you succeed. I think maybe inside you knew all along that your mom was a fucking bitch.
2631040	2635040	I always knew. Krista.
2635040	2637040	So now roll first aid for me.
2637040	2641040	I was one roll ahead in my head.
2641040	2644040	Okay, I got a 66 on a 50.
2644040	2654040	You have absolutely no idea what happened here or why he's like this, but you feel a poke behind you as you're looking around this room.
2654040	2666040	And the raccoon is standing in the doorway motioning like, let's get the fuck out of here.
2666040	2668040	That's what the raccoon says with its arms.
2668040	2670040	He says let's get the fuck out of here with his arms.
2670040	2671040	Let's get the fuck out of here.
2671040	2672040	Cool. I follow him.
2672040	2673040	Okay.
2673040	2674040	I'm losing my mind.
2674040	2677040	That absolutely makes sense.
2677040	2686040	Judy, you follow this raccoon out into the rain, into the darkness.
2686040	2692040	There's one light that overshadows the entire parking lot and it's flickering.
2692040	2702040	You turn the corner on the other side of the shack and looking down the trailhead, a lightning bolt flashes in the distance.
2702040	2714040	And it's just enough to light up a blood-covered Krista Krenkelhoff who is walking directly toward you.
2732040	2742040	The sun is sleeping soon.
2742040	2753040	She knows that the time has come.
2753040	2782040	To dance beneath the shadow of the moon.
2782040	2793040	She moves with the howling wind.
2793040	2805040	The sun has come again.
2805040	2816040	Her eyes have seen it all.
2816040	2825040	The wonders of the wonders of the shadow of the moon.
