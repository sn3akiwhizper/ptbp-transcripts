0	6420	Greetings my disciples, it is your leader in prayer and song, Wolf the Dog, and I am
6420	11540	here to preach the good word about all the happenings in this silly thing we call life.
11540	17760	I'm also here to tell y'all about how to attain true salvation and get y'all into dumps to
17760	18760	meet heaven.
18760	22240	The one true secret to life and happiness is...
22240	26920	Oh wait, before that we got a show to run here y'all, apologies.
26920	31300	This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Doug Blake, who recommended pretending to be people
31300	32300	on Facebook.
32300	39900	I mean, this week's Howlin' with Wolf is an Ari Manstein event review by ZomBenny2099.
39900	44680	The location for this event could not have been better, set among the classically themed
44680	48640	mausoleum littered venue that is the city cemetery.
48640	54260	The Samba Stone family plots lent a sense of reverence that most crawfish boils sadly
54260	56100	lack these days.
56100	61400	Upon my arrival I was instantly hit with sweet and savory smells that reaffirmed my hopes
61400	63960	that this would be a boil to remember.
63960	68220	But alas, the only thing I will remember is my disappointment.
68220	74320	First and foremost the service was terrible, there weren't even any eating utensils provided.
74320	80080	I actually witnessed a hip, well dressed young man, obviously from the city, resort to eatin'
80080	83660	straight from the pot as no one came to serve him.
83720	87440	Needless to say, I never actually got to taste any crawfish.
87440	91800	Equally as disappointing, the music was nonsensical.
91800	97000	I'm as down with new age music as the next city dweller, but this was just weird gibberish
97000	101560	that seemed to last forever and yet was over as soon as it began.
101560	106580	I was not alone in thinking this as several frustrated diners shot the DJ.
106580	111880	It was around this time that I took my leave, disappointed and hungry.
111900	117740	Still, all things considered, not the worst crawfish boil I've been to, two and a half
117740	119820	stars out of five.
119820	124980	You know, Wolf ain't never been to a crawfish boil that didn't have some kinda crazy shit
124980	126420	go down.
126420	131740	But all that crazy shit always leads to a massive reward at the end of the night when
131740	138820	they dump out all them shells into the trash, a treasure trove of candy red exoskeletons
138820	145040	discarded by the masses, all so your old little old wolf can take a Scrooge McDuck
145040	151280	dive into them, swimmin' around gettin' my fill with my mouth wide open.
151280	155620	That is the kinda spicy bug I like to eat.
155620	160480	So anyway, you need to remember, if you wanna write up somethin' for your wolf to how, tag
160480	166100	at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter, tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook, or write
166100	171160	a five-star review and email us at PretendingPod at Gmail.com.
171160	177960	You are due to get bruised and lose your shoes if you choose to snooze on the news, baby.
177960	181840	Keith Vigna was shoved into a secret room in Jim Cook's house.
181840	187400	Clark Bishop found a well-worn VHS tape of his parents playing Wheel of Fortune and winning
187400	189080	a honeymoon.
189080	194400	John Lee Pettymore found an envelope with a letter from Jim Cook alongside three folders
194400	197700	outlining three different operations.
197700	203640	The group recovered at a walk-in clinic before toolin' up and enterin' Marvin Glass's playground
203640	206940	through a trap door like great in an alleyway.
206940	213940	Speaking of playgrounds, I hear those PretendingToBePeople boys are gonna be playin' around and loitering
213940	215820	on Twitch this Friday.
215820	223060	They can be found at twitch.tv slash pretendingpodstreams.
223080	227240	I hear one of those boys might sound a lot like me.
227240	230000	Yeah, right, that'd be crazy, y'all.
230000	235320	Aw, hell yeah, the thought of those boys streamin' has Wolf's face beamin'.
235320	241200	But until then, I'll keep dreamin' and dreamin' of incessant screamin'.
241200	247280	It's Kudzu with no backbone.
253060	280800	Let it pop, pop, pop, pop, in your butthole pop.
280800	282840	Put all the poppers in your butthole now.
282840	284620	Put them up there and lick them real good.
284620	285620	Let me get that popper.
285620	287440	Make it a spicy butthole.
287440	289600	Spicy butthole in my pants.
289600	291480	Spicy butthole does my dance.
291480	293920	I like dancing with my butt.
293920	296080	You will like me when I strut.
296080	297080	Strut.
297080	298080	Oh!
298080	300080	Luke, what'd you do for your birthday?
300080	306640	I literally woke up, sat on my couch, smoked weed all day, and watched Twitch.
306640	307640	Nice.
307640	309020	What'd you watch on Twitch?
309020	317700	I watched, well, at 8 p.m. is when Lord Caboon plays Grand Theft Auto roleplay.
317700	321500	So I watched that from about 8 p.m. until 3 in the morning.
321500	322500	That's Mr. Chang.
322500	323580	That's Mr. Chang.
323580	324580	He's my favorite.
324580	328740	The voice is a fun character.
328740	335300	Anyway, he's also, I think, the most watched Grand Theft Auto roleplayer on Twitch.
335300	336300	He's a lot of fun.
336300	337780	Anyway, I did that, and I also watched.
337780	338780	It is a lot of fun.
339780	341940	I watched a movie called About Time.
341940	346060	Oh yeah, with Donal Gleason.
346060	347060	Is that his name?
347060	348060	That's Brendan Gleason's son.
348060	349060	No way.
349060	350060	Yeah, Matt I. Moody's son.
350060	351060	Which I didn't know for a long time.
351060	354500	Oh yeah, because he's also in a couple, or maybe one Black Mirror episode.
354500	355500	The fucking fairytale.
355500	356500	Yeah.
356500	360260	But no, it was an enjoyable movie, cheesy at times, but I also love Rachel McAdams.
360260	361260	Oh yeah.
361260	364380	And I forgot, well, didn't forget, but Margot Robbie was in it as well.
364380	365500	Oh, I didn't remember that.
365500	367260	Isn't Bill Nye the dad in that?
367260	368260	Is that how you say his name?
368740	369740	Wait.
369740	370740	I think it's Nye.
370740	371740	Nye.
371740	372740	Oh, I thought you said Bill Nye.
372740	373740	I'm like, no.
373740	374740	Bill Nye, the British guy.
374740	375740	Yeah, no.
375740	376740	I very much enjoyed it.
376740	377740	Bill Nye.
377740	378740	And before I watched About Time, I watched.
378740	379740	Peach, Bill Nye.
379740	387700	I watched some Chef's Table, and I watched a guy play this survival game, I don't remember,
387700	388820	something dark.
388820	389940	Long Winter or something like that?
389940	391380	The Long Dark is what it was called.
391380	392380	The Long Dark.
392380	393380	Nice.
393380	396180	But yeah, I ordered Postmates slash Uber Eats twice.
396180	397180	Oh wow.
397180	398180	Yeah.
399100	400100	Fucking birthday baby.
400100	401100	Yeah, you really hit it up.
401100	404300	And I was thinking about going to Cherry Picker later in the night, and I was like, you know
404300	405300	what?
405300	406300	Fuck it.
406300	407300	I'm literally not going to change out of my pajamas.
407300	408780	I had a great time.
408780	409780	Hell yeah.
409780	410780	Well, heck yeah.
410780	411780	And you can finally vote.
411780	412780	I can finally vote now.
412780	415780	Yeah, listeners, Luke is legal.
415780	420780	You can vote at 16 in Missouri.
420780	421780	Yeah.
421780	427900	We've been trotting out this jail bait for you, but Lukey boys are all grown up.
427900	432860	When I was younger, I leaned very much to the left, but you know, my parents, a lot
432860	436580	of older people say like, once you get older, you'll be more conservative.
436580	441460	And yesterday I woke up and I was like, damn, I kind of want to vote for Donald Trump today.
441460	443500	Oh my God.
443500	445380	Well that's legitimately horrifying.
445380	446380	Happy birthday.
446380	447380	Yeah, thank you very much.
447380	448980	No, that'll never happen.
448980	451120	Listeners, I'm kidding.
451120	452120	Happy birthday.
452120	455460	Unless you like Donald Trump, then give us more of your money.
455460	456460	Yeah.
456460	457460	Pledge to us, not him.
457460	463740	So, uh, Joe, when Joe got into the home today, he opened up the fridge to grab one of the
463740	464800	beers that he brought.
464800	467380	And then he just started giggling like a madman.
467380	469380	I bought myself some long neck Coronas.
469380	474100	It turns out they weren't all long.
474100	479260	I had somehow bought the seven ounce Corona bottles that for some reason look like long
479260	484780	necks coming out of the top of the six pack, but they just got little stubby bottle bottoms.
484780	486580	Why did they make those?
486580	487580	For the light drinker?
487580	488580	I guess.
488580	489580	I don't know.
489580	490580	Well, wow.
490580	491580	It's for kids.
491580	494620	Well, I mean, what is the drinking age in Mexico?
494620	495620	21.
495620	500460	No, it's, I drank when I was like 14 there.
500460	501460	That's so cool.
501460	502460	Like two years ago.
502460	503460	Yeah.
503460	507660	I went to the swim up bar and I was like, I like, whatever that drink is, it looks good.
507660	510020	And it was like a, like a mudslide or a white Russian or something.
510020	512420	And I drink and I was like, tastes good, but kind of bad.
512420	514540	And then my dad was like, what the fuck are you like?
514540	519420	I didn't do it on purpose, but she didn't get a boner in the pool and that's why you
519420	520420	don't like big mouth.
520420	521420	All right.
521420	523900	So I forgot about that.
523900	527980	I mean, I don't hate it, but I mean, I've only, I've only seen like, all right, so let's
527980	531180	get into this episode 39.
531180	532180	That's a big number.
532180	536620	We're almost to a, almost a 30, 30 more to go.
536620	540940	We're almost at, if you listen to us, you could have worked an entire work week, but
540940	544780	instead you enjoyed it with us.
544780	546460	So let's kick it off the bat.
546460	552460	You guys were, I believe, falling through the, the grate in front of the dirty dog grooming.
552460	553460	Is that correct?
553460	559020	The giant building downtown that, you know, is the glass compound or some cool flowers
559020	560020	around.
560020	561020	Absolutely.
561020	564900	Maybe the last time you'll ever see flowers, you know, as you guys are falling, let's go
564900	565900	ahead.
565900	570660	And as you head into the den of sin, as you've been calling it, let's do it.
570660	571660	You called it that.
571660	572660	Yeah.
572660	573660	I certainly did.
573660	578980	As you guys have been calling it, we called it that because you learned it from watching
578980	581520	you.
581520	583980	And as you guys are falling, let's, let's do an equipment check.
583980	585700	Let's see what you guys have on you.
585700	587540	Who wants to start last episode?
587540	590100	I just bought, or I bought three pistols altogether.
590100	593700	I've got two in the waistband and one in my boot.
593700	598720	And then a John Lee Pettymore bought us all a couple of flash grenades, a couple of regular
598720	600480	grenades and a couple of smoke grenades.
600480	601480	Cool.
601480	605880	And you're also wearing an old school contention, police officers uniform.
605880	606880	Correct.
606880	607880	Anything else on you?
607880	608880	I might have one more pistol.
608880	612280	I guess I would still have the one that Maggie gave me to take out, you can have four on
612280	613280	you if you want.
613280	614280	It's a lot of pistols.
614280	615280	Yeah, sure.
615280	616280	All right.
616280	620640	Tell me if it's too meta, but I have giant pockets in my giant shorts.
620640	621640	I don't know.
621640	624760	Maybe I should be carrying your guns at first now.
624760	625760	That's fine.
625760	626760	I hate it.
626760	628040	If I would've thought about it last episode, I would have said it.
628040	630320	He throws it to you while you're falling midair.
630320	631320	Okay.
631320	633280	So what do you have on you Luke?
633280	640560	I have my small but powerful pistol, two frag grenades, two flash grenades, two smoke grenades.
640560	646000	And then on my back I have the giant fully auto machine gun.
646000	648240	Two ARs welded together.
648240	649240	Basically.
649240	650240	Cold fusion gun.
650240	653680	It's like a double neck guitar, but a gun.
653680	654800	That's fucking awesome.
654800	656800	What a great description.
656800	657800	It's balling.
657800	662320	And then, well, I'll ask this later.
662320	663320	And Thomas, what do you have on you?
663320	665840	What does John Lee, Kevin Pettimore have on you?
665840	669500	He's got his robot body.
669500	671760	He's got body armor on top of that.
671760	673740	All the grenades, same as the others.
673740	679760	He's got a powerful pistol with a large magazine and a semi-automatic shotgun.
679760	680760	Absolutely.
680760	682080	Armed to the veritable teeth.
682080	685360	To the veritable teeth indeed, my good sir.
685360	686720	Joe and I were talking.
686720	691240	I think maybe we should say what our health points are before we start, just so the listener
691240	692240	knows.
692240	693240	I think that's really smart.
693240	694840	Let's get a rundown of your health and your sanity.
694840	697320	I am currently at 16 hit points.
697320	703280	I had a maximum of 26 and my current sanity is at 18 with a breaking point at six.
703280	711400	I have 25 out of 25 hit points and my sanity is at 11 with a breaking point of eight.
711400	712400	All right.
712440	716960	That's 19 of 20 hit points and my sanity is at 18.
716960	717960	Good.
717960	718960	Pretty good sanity.
718960	719960	Yeah.
719960	720960	All right.
720960	723680	Does anyone have any final words?
723680	728800	We're here to eat ass and kill bubblegum and we're all out of bubblegum.
728800	731640	You know how that trap door opened at the last episode?
731640	734160	Clark clings to the edge, pulls himself up and leaves.
734160	740400	He just goes back to his house, watches Wheel of Fortune until he dies, until the end of
740400	741400	the world.
741400	749320	It starts out with all of us going, three Wilhelm screams.
749320	758200	Also while we were spot on, I forgot to add while we were at a, unbeknownst to pretty
758200	764260	much anybody at the gun shop, I had filled some of one of the cargo pants.
764260	768740	I went over to the bait shop of the, of the gun store and filled one of my pockets up
768740	770620	with a catfish food.
770620	772900	Oh, very small.
772900	773900	Why catfish?
773900	775100	Have you ever seen catfish food?
775100	777340	It's like real mushy and super stinky.
777340	778980	Is that what you cover your arm with?
778980	779980	Yeah.
779980	781860	Have you ever gone noodling?
781860	785560	I think I might have told this story once, but I went with my dad or my uncle.
785560	788940	We went gigging and noodling one day.
788940	789940	Giggings fun.
789940	791260	You get to eat some frog legs.
791260	796060	Noodling sucks because a catfish bites your fucking arm and that's how you catch it.
796060	798460	So yeah, that sounds like garbage.
798460	800420	Yeah, I'll definitely allow that.
800420	801740	You're supposed to use your dick.
801740	803420	Oh, mine's not big enough.
803420	804420	It's recreation.
804420	805420	Boom.
805420	810820	I can only fold it in half once.
810820	811820	Call back.
811820	814180	Eight times if you really tried.
814180	816820	Uh, anyway, yeah, so I do have that.
816820	822680	As you fall downward into darkness, you almost immediately feel your body's slow and begin
822680	828420	to float gently like you're just hanging weightless in vast nothingness.
828420	834240	And then abruptly a bright light covers your entire field of vision and huge words appear
834240	840520	in front of you in a spray painted font as a rumbling voice reads the massive tag that
840520	845520	says, welcome to the scrap it.
845520	850840	What you can only assume is the biggest Omnimax screen of all time fades to black and a video
850840	852480	begins to play.
852480	856880	It looks to be the inside of an enormous arena made of glass.
856880	862880	In the background, hundreds of screaming spectators in the foreground, a hole begins to form in
862880	866080	the floor and a shadowy form begins to emerge.
866080	872160	But before this person can even hit the lights of the arena, a giant metal tentacle erupts
872160	876620	into view, gripping the humanoid being and ripping it out of frame.
876620	881860	The screen fades to black and you feel your feet touch the ground, your weight coming
881860	885540	back down into your bodies.
885540	892520	You all are standing in a cube of a room 20 feet across, made almost entirely of the oily
892520	896000	obsidian you have previously seen in this building.
896000	897940	It is disorienting.
897940	904420	Across the room is a mouth of a concrete cave with the logo for the scrap pit spray painted
904420	906060	above its entrance.
906060	912160	To your left are two guards standing in front of a red, deep buttoned plush door.
912160	914500	The guards are in full brown jumpsuits.
914500	917720	They each have a large scythe strapped to their backs and the blade of each scythe is
917720	919760	shaped like an enormous fish hook.
919760	924640	A closer look reveals these men have unnatural matching faces.
924640	928360	Their eyes are far apart, almost on either side of their face.
928360	933560	Their noses do not jut out but are rather two slits above their two wide thick lipped
933560	937480	mouths and they have a few flaps on either side of their necks.
937480	943980	They turn and upon seeing you, press a button that lights up green and they move out of
943980	947700	the way to either side of the gaudy door.
947700	948700	What do you do?
948700	949780	Noodle them, Keith.
949780	959780	I think we just go, I think, I think, uh, I think we just go right through that door.
959780	974040	We do a little noodle and nod over at them and then we go right past.
974040	975280	Clark wants to look up.
975280	979600	Can I see where we came from or is it, is it a closed space that we fell from?
979600	982280	It is just darkness above you.
982280	983660	What do we see through the doors?
983660	990200	Through the doors is a, another smaller room made completely out of the same oily black
990200	991200	material.
991200	994280	I just feel like we're going to walk into another Marvin Glass stadium.
994280	997340	I mean, I don't really have any other options at this point.
997340	1001200	I think we go through the gaudy doors and I mean they hit the green button.
1001200	1003820	Gotta be better than a hypothetical red button.
1003820	1006000	Can I see what you guys are picturing?
1006000	1007680	How are you arranged right now?
1007680	1009600	Are you two backing him already?
1009600	1013340	Do you have, he's in the middle and we're escorting them and I on either side.
1013340	1019760	He's got a gun wound that we literally gave him and I think we're just maybe have your
1019760	1022780	hands behind your back, but not like cuffed or anything.
1022780	1027600	And we're like, and we glued dog fur all over him, so he looks real Chewbacca.
1027600	1032120	But I think we just, we look like he's our prisoner and we're walking him.
1032120	1035480	I'll keep maybe a sullen head down kind of look on me the whole time.
1035480	1037480	I like you best when you look like that.
1037480	1043120	All right, so you guys march him into the, I might emphasize my limp even like look real
1043120	1046940	wounded and I'm non-threatening, but they've got me handily.
1046940	1051660	These total fish men absolutely pay attention to your hobble.
1051660	1058340	You guys march Clark Bishop into this room and the room's interior walls, floor and ceiling
1058340	1064220	are the same beautiful like onyx obsidian reflector and the door closes behind you.
1064220	1067900	There's nothing, just the shimmering black mirror on all six sides.
1067900	1071700	And then you feel the room begin to move.
1071700	1074760	Who has the lowest luck?
1074760	1075760	I have 35.
1075760	1076760	I got 60.
1076760	1077760	I've got 20.
1077760	1078760	All righty.
1078760	1080680	Thomas, go ahead and roll luck for me.
1080680	1081680	All right.
1081680	1084600	I'm going to use these dice that Joe got me for the first time.
1084600	1085600	Nice.
1085600	1086600	Hope they serve you well.
1086600	1087600	I'm going to open mine up too.
1087600	1088600	Oh, okay.
1088600	1089600	93.
1089600	1090600	All right.
1090600	1091600	That's my fault.
1091600	1092600	I'm so sorry.
1092600	1093600	Son of a bitch.
1093600	1094600	I loaded you up.
1094600	1095600	I'm so sorry.
1095600	1096600	That's my fault.
1096600	1097600	I'm so sorry.
1097600	1099600	Son of a bitch.
1099600	1103820	I loaded your guys' dice.
1103820	1105820	I'm the only one getting out of here alive.
1105820	1107820	I'm going to win.
1107820	1112100	I'm not going to win.
1112100	1115100	It's a me, Joe-io.
1115100	1119260	Wildy Joe.
1119260	1127760	One of the walls opens, and you are looking into this dark room lit by two lanterns on
1127760	1133640	either side of the room that have open flames coming from them.
1133640	1139240	Right in front of you, there are six individuals passed out all in their underwear.
1139240	1146640	Most are pretty rough-looking young children, and one is Oz, Mayhem, Wolf.
1146640	1154100	They are all unconscious as a group of what I can only describe as grandmothers.
1154100	1155940	They are older women.
1155940	1163780	They are all dressed in long skirts and cardigans, and they have their hair up in tight little
1163780	1167580	buns like Aunt B. How about that?
1167580	1175160	They are all humming and walking in a strange pattern around this room, pouring a strange
1175160	1181600	liquid into the mouths of these six passed out individuals.
1181600	1184900	Real quick, I just need all of you to roll Sanity for me.
1184900	1185900	Fail.
1185900	1186900	38.
1186900	1192820	Oh my god, I passed 14 on an 18.
1192820	1193820	Fuck.
1193820	1195580	I rolled a 33.
1195580	1196580	Crit fail.
1196580	1197580	Yeah.
1197580	1204100	Keith Vigna and Thomas John Lee Pettymore both lose one Sanity, and for this, Joe, I'm
1204100	1208440	going to have you just take your headphones off and plug your ear holes.
1208440	1209440	Okay.
1209440	1211040	And don't read our lips.
1211040	1215320	This is the first time we've mentioned Joe's embarrassing ear holes instead of ears.
1215320	1218520	He just has these weird, like a Voldemort-like sucky-
1218520	1223360	I'm nervous about all the laughter I'm seeing around the room.
1223360	1225360	He really plugged them.
1225360	1227360	His mom is a rhino.
1227360	1231040	Yeah, they are rhino ears.
1231040	1240660	So as you guys are looking into this room, the two of you see two ethereal spirits that
1240660	1246740	are hanging above these grandmothers, and one is a black dog and the other is a red
1246740	1253660	lion, and they are weaving in and out of these grandmothers as they're walking and pouring
1253660	1259940	this liquid into the mouths of the passed out individuals, and these spirits are diving
1259940	1263160	in and out of the bodies that are lying in front of you.
1263160	1267080	Does there seem to be any connection between their movements or who they're diving into
1267080	1269680	and who the grandmas are giving what it is?
1269680	1270680	Absolutely.
1270680	1271680	Okay.
1271680	1274320	Joe, you can come back now.
1274320	1278480	I saw some hand gestures coming from Zach over there, and I turned away real quick just
1278480	1282160	to make sure I wouldn't glean anything from the beautiful sign language you're providing.
1282160	1288500	Well, they say that you can put mute on a good story and still know what's happening,
1288500	1290840	but I don't know if that would work for this medium.
1290840	1291840	Not for this medium.
1291840	1292840	I don't know, listeners.
1292840	1293840	Give it a shot.
1293840	1300240	I am disturbed, and I look at Kevin John, who's like wide-eyed.
1300240	1302240	What the fuck was that?
1302240	1303240	I don't know, man.
1303240	1309020	As you guys are staring at each other, one of the elderly women just walks into the room
1309020	1315520	with you, and the door shuts behind her, and she just turns to face the door and stands
1315520	1317520	there.
1317540	1319540	Blergeith.
1323340	1324340	I don't say anything.
1324340	1328060	I just stand there hoping that this elevator goes to someone we can talk to.
1328060	1331660	It continues moving, and she turns around to the two of you.
1331660	1333620	Oh, do you have a prisoner?
1333620	1334620	We do.
1334620	1335620	Yes.
1335620	1336620	What did he do?
1336620	1337940	He betrayed Marvin Glass.
1337940	1343420	Well, that is not a good idea, young sir, she says to Clark Bishop.
1343420	1344420	That's why we brought him here.
1344420	1346180	He needs to be punished.
1346200	1349640	Well, we'll certainly make sure that he's punished, won't we?
1349640	1350640	I hope so.
1350640	1351640	You better.
1351640	1354600	But we'd like, yeah, we'd like to tell- We need him for a while first, though.
1354600	1360080	We need to tell somebody higher up, well, I was, I don't know who you are, but if you
1360080	1363120	could get us to somebody, I was tasked with a major-
1363120	1364120	He's new.
1364120	1369840	I was tasked with something major for Marvin, and he got in my way and made that task impossible.
1369840	1371880	Oh, I'm sure you were, honey.
1371880	1374080	This is Keith Vigna.
1374100	1377460	He's going to be around working for us for a while, why don't you go ahead and introduce
1377460	1378460	yourself?
1378460	1379460	Oh, hi Keith.
1379460	1385140	Kevin, thank you for making me aware of not introducing myself, I'm so sorry, that's such
1385140	1387540	rude manners of mine.
1387540	1393220	Keith Vigna, my name is Ursula, it's very nice to meet you, Ursula Oscythe, it's very
1393220	1394220	nice to meet you.
1394220	1398060	It's nice to meet you as well, I can't look, or I am looking forward to working with you
1398060	1399060	in the future.
1399060	1403160	Ursula, you could say it better than me, why don't you tell Keith a little bit about what
1403160	1405140	you and the others like you do here?
1405140	1407220	Oh, well of course, yeah, welcome.
1407220	1414980	So basically what we do is we carry on a very old tradition of making sure that the sacrifices
1414980	1417700	are ready to be useful.
1417700	1418920	And how do you go about that?
1418920	1425920	As you well know, it's a long drawn out process of lots of ingredients and lots of words and
1426100	1433100	lots of specific directions and maths, but after some time we're able to put together
1433460	1440460	a nice sort of change of blood for those that we bathe in our fun time juice.
1441460	1447900	Oh, I think I've heard of, Kevin's been telling me about, it sounds like a fun time, you know,
1447900	1448900	all around.
1448900	1449900	It is, it absolutely is.
1449900	1455420	And I know that you seem to be looking for someone to speak to, Keith Vigna, is that
1455420	1456420	right?
1456420	1465180	Well, I had spoken with Marvin just earlier today and I was supposed to do something for
1465180	1470560	him and I need to talk with him and let him know what happened and ask him what I can
1470560	1471560	do next.
1471560	1477200	The door begins to open and she says, well, I'm sure you're going exactly where you need
1477200	1478200	to.
1478200	1479200	Nice to meet you.
1479200	1481600	And then motions for you to get off the elevator.
1481600	1483560	Have a good one, Ursula.
1483560	1486340	Good to see you, Kevin.
1486340	1491900	And then I think in my head, we're probably supposed to get off here.
1491900	1492900	Yeah, Keith.
1492900	1493900	Yeah.
1493900	1494900	Yeah, you get out.
1494900	1495900	Let's do it.
1495900	1496900	Let's do that.
1496900	1497900	Get the fuck out of the elevator.
1497900	1499460	I didn't say it out loud.
1499460	1501140	This is my elevator now.
1501140	1503740	She was totally hitting on me, right?
1503740	1507100	Dude, did you see the way she looked at you?
1507100	1508100	That was weird.
1508100	1509100	Wow.
1509100	1510940	She's kind of old, but she's not that bad looking.
1510940	1513120	Ursula, it's not maybe the name I would pick.
1513120	1515120	All that torturing kept her fit.
1515120	1516120	Okay.
1516120	1518120	We walk off the elevator.
1518120	1522640	You guys are still having this conversation and the camera zooms out and you are in a
1522640	1524200	massive room.
1524200	1531180	The door is already shut behind you and this room is dark and it is damp and you smell,
1531180	1537580	you know that like that kind of YMCA kind of aquarium kind of smell going on?
1537580	1538800	Nasty chlorine.
1538800	1539800	Yes.
1539800	1546060	It is endless and it smells fucking terrible and also extremely fishy.
1546060	1550020	If there was a place to do noodling, it would be here.
1550020	1551260	Get your arm ready.
1551260	1557580	Looking out, you see that there is a grid of catwalks that are absolutely infinite going
1557580	1559020	away from you.
1559020	1569020	Above them is a light fog and this is all hanging over dark greenish murky water below.
1569020	1570200	It's open water below us.
1570200	1576160	It is open water below you and in the squares of the grid in the opening where the catwalks
1576160	1584600	are not covering, hanging from the foggy darkness above are rusty moss covered chains.
1584600	1590200	Now some of the chains are just hanging like 10 feet out of the water and some of the chains
1590200	1593520	go all the way in the water.
1593520	1599780	In the distance, you see that a handful of these have people hanging from them.
1599780	1603140	Are they alive or are they corpses?
1603140	1605780	They are small in your view.
1605780	1606780	They're far away.
1606780	1608220	No, they're small.
1608220	1609220	They're just tiny people.
1609220	1610220	I mean, I've seen one of those.
1610220	1612820	They're hanging at the bottom of the chains.
1612820	1613820	Still above the water.
1613820	1614820	Above the water.
1614820	1615820	Still well above the water.
1615820	1616820	Gotcha.
1616820	1617820	Yes.
1617820	1618820	This is spooky.
1618820	1619820	Let's keep moving.
1619820	1621460	Dude, that's a really cool image.
1621460	1626800	I just picture that so well in my brain and it's creepy and kind of beautiful in a weird
1626800	1627800	way.
1627800	1629800	Green fog, like on a swampy.
1629800	1633640	I mean, you said they're far away, but can we see movement from any of them that are
1633640	1634640	hanging?
1634640	1635640	Yeah.
1635640	1639680	And let's go ahead and roll alertness for me or search depending.
1639680	1641280	You can each roll on this one.
1641280	1644280	I'll give it to you.
1644280	1647760	Sixteen on a 60 for alertness.
1647760	1649760	Forty one on a 70 for alertness.
1649760	1652180	I got a 38 on 60 for alertness.
1652180	1653180	All right.
1653180	1654180	Did we all pass?
1654180	1655180	Mm-hmm.
1655180	1656180	Nice.
1656180	1657180	Group success.
1657180	1658180	We're alert as fuck.
1658180	1659180	You guys get to see everything.
1659180	1663500	Oh, you guys get to see everything.
1663500	1667060	Is that still Ursula talking?
1667060	1668620	Only for Kevin.
1668620	1676520	So you see there is only one guard in sight and it is one of these unnatural looking fish
1676520	1678500	men wearing a brown jumpsuit.
1678520	1686200	You also hear three voices in the unseen darkness across the enormous chamber.
1686200	1692640	And because you guys rolled so well, you're going to recognize the voices that you hear.
1692640	1695520	Keith, one of them is Francis Beans.
1695520	1696520	My niece.
1696520	1697520	Your niece.
1697520	1701240	The other two are voices that you guys haven't heard in a while.
1701240	1704920	It is Kathy and George Piston.
1704920	1705920	Oh.
1705920	1706920	Wow.
1706940	1708940	It's been a while.
1708940	1709940	Days even.
1709940	1715700	Now, if you'll remember Kathy and George Piston, George is Leo's brother, Leo Piston, and they
1715700	1719420	run the Piston Pig Farm and the Piston Junkyard.
1719420	1720780	Keith spent some time out there.
1720780	1722700	I believe Kathy shot him in the foot.
1722700	1723700	She did.
1723700	1726100	I got to take a little trip on her school bus.
1726100	1729260	Yeah, which was full of about a hundred homeless people.
1729260	1730260	Yeah.
1730260	1734080	It was also that junkyard that kind of started us on this entire path where there was a body
1734080	1735080	that showed up there.
1735080	1736080	Absolutely.
1736140	1737140	Where'd your pencil go?
1737140	1740140	I just dropped it right down there.
1740140	1742100	Real fast, Keith, what was your brother's name?
1742100	1743420	Yeah, real fast, Keith.
1743420	1744800	What was your brother's name?
1744800	1745800	Was it not Francis?
1745800	1748300	No, Francis was my niece.
1748300	1753540	Fucking what was that?
1753540	1754540	Some knew him.
1754540	1755540	It has something to do with beans.
1755540	1756540	Oh, I know what it is.
1756540	1757540	I know what it is.
1757540	1758540	It's Fergie.
1758540	1759540	Fergie.
1759540	1760540	I was thinking it was Francis.
1760640	1764520	Go back and look at all the beans names.
1764520	1769020	There's a pattern there.
1769020	1770020	So yeah, Fergie makes sense.
1770020	1771020	Sorry.
1771020	1772020	Can we hear what they're saying?
1772020	1777120	You are a little bit too far away from them right now to actually hear what they're saying,
1777120	1780480	but you just recognize the tenor of their voices.
1780480	1781680	So we don't have eyes on them?
1781680	1785360	You can kind of see outlines that would help you realize who they were.
1785360	1787480	They are like 200 yards away from you.
1787480	1790060	There is some sort of light source in here.
1790060	1791360	It's not pitch black at all.
1791360	1792360	It is not.
1792360	1794420	No, there is some unseen light source.
1794420	1796480	Are they like in front of us or do they come from?
1796480	1797720	Yeah, they're in front of you.
1797720	1802000	As far as we can tell from here, are they just standing on a random catwalk or is there
1802000	1804680	something near them that they're maybe congregated near?
1804680	1813600	Well, it seems like based on those great roles that Francis Beans is standing on a catwalk.
1813600	1816280	Kathy and George Piston are both hanging.
1816280	1817280	Gotcha.
1817280	1818280	Oh wow.
1818280	1819280	Oh.
1819500	1822620	This is fucking cool.
1822620	1828620	I like whispered, do you guys want to, I mean, want to just approach them?
1828620	1831940	Is it just in front of us that we can walk or can we take other paths?
1831940	1833620	It's a big old grid, baby.
1833620	1836460	John, do you know where we are if you've been in here before?
1836460	1838140	No, unfortunately not.
1838140	1841820	Do you guys want to go straight at Francis?
1841820	1843660	We can just like push her over the rail.
1843660	1845340	I mean, yeah, we could.
1845340	1846340	One down.
1846340	1847780	Let her sleep with the fishmen.
1847800	1851800	We try to get around her, but I don't want to get lost in this place.
1851800	1854160	We might go talk to Francis, see if she can lead us.
1854160	1855160	That's true.
1855160	1859640	We could, if she starts to get violent, we can just three versus one.
1859640	1860880	She's a little girl.
1860880	1861880	Just throwing it out there.
1861880	1865640	We could also wait for her to leave and follow her.
1865640	1870280	Follow and also maybe rescue Kathy and George and have another, have an army with us.
1870280	1871480	I don't know.
1871480	1873080	But maybe also fuck these pistons.
1873080	1874080	Yeah.
1874080	1875080	That's also true.
1875080	1878420	I don't know what it would be to go talk to her, but we can also wait until she leaves
1878420	1880300	and try to follow her where she's going.
1880300	1882300	What do you guys think?
1882300	1883620	I'll do whatever you guys want.
1883620	1885660	I'm the prisoner right now.
1885660	1889060	But not in real life.
1889060	1890820	You can't have that mindset.
1890820	1896340	Oh man, we've already lost.
1896340	1900980	It's like when you were a kid and you were trying to get out of school, so you acted
1900980	1904100	sick, but acting sick made you feel bad.
1904120	1905800	And then you just wasted a day.
1905800	1910200	I just mean you guys captured me fair and square and I don't know.
1910200	1912440	I'm your prisoner, dammit.
1912440	1914920	I think we should just go, let's go talk to her.
1914920	1915920	Let's go talk to her.
1915920	1919760	Worst case scenario, we push her into one of these feed and fish tanks.
1919760	1921880	Just say, Hey, uh, Hey Frankie.
1921880	1924440	Uh, well let's, let's walk up and get closer to her.
1924440	1925440	I say that.
1925440	1927440	I say, Hey Frankie.
1927440	1933240	As you guys are walking down the catwalk, you would see you're getting into a section
1933260	1936100	where there are more people hanging.
1936100	1943180	Most of them are unconscious and they are all hanging from a fish hook that is going
1943180	1946780	through their crossed forearms.
1946780	1951600	So their arms are crossed and through the spot where they are crossing, there is a fish
1951600	1954500	hook going in both forearms.
1954500	1961340	I kind of awkwardly nod and wave as the people, as we pass, excuse me, sorry, passing through.
1962080	1968660	Just one of them sees Kevin and he's like, fuck you, you devil.
1968660	1973320	Every single mess you've ever made in your life is one more thing that's taken you closer
1973320	1975440	to hell fire and brimstone.
1975440	1978440	You absolute piece of devil witch garbage.
1978440	1984840	I get right up in his face and I say, yeah, I'm going to hell and I'll see you there.
1984840	1986360	And then I'd poke him in the eye.
1986360	1991280	Ow, ow, fuck, ow, shit, do you have any eye drops?
1992260	1995060	As you guys continue, you do see that one of the...
1995060	1996560	Can I scan other faces?
1996560	1998940	Is there anybody else here that I recognize or no?
1998940	2006540	Yeah, as you scan the rest of the faces, you do recognize the body of agent Trent Chad
2006540	2013300	also hanging from one of these fish hooks and his eyes rise up to meet yours and he
2013300	2016260	freaks the fuck out.
2016260	2017260	What?
2017280	2018280	What?
2018280	2025600	You guys were, you're dead, you're fucking dead.
2025600	2032800	He looks at Keith Vigna and Clark Bishop and he's like, what the absolute fuck happened?
2032800	2038080	The last time I saw you, you, you, you, and, and now you're...
2038080	2043520	And he kind of notices that Keith is walking a prisoner, Clark Bishop with Kevin.
2043520	2047120	He's like, you're working with these fucking assholes now?
2047140	2048300	What is wrong with you?
2048300	2062020	I stick my tongue out at him and go, wow, have fun DM.
2062020	2068180	I have absolutely no words for the wretch that you have become.
2068180	2070980	I say sayonara bitch and then we keep walking.
2070980	2072260	I want to shoot him a wink.
2072260	2073260	You can definitely wink at him.
2073260	2074260	I shoot him a wink.
2074260	2075920	Does he react at all?
2075920	2077660	He spits it, Keith.
2077660	2079060	I keep looking forward.
2079060	2080060	All right.
2080060	2082980	As you guys are going, you can hear Francis beans.
2082980	2083980	All right.
2083980	2090020	So like, seriously, I'm only going to ask you like one more time.
2090020	2093980	Who started the fucking outbreak in contention?
2093980	2095160	Who did it?
2095160	2097420	Kathy piston spits.
2097420	2102380	I told you, I don't know what that means.
2102380	2104100	I don't know what that means.
2104100	2105100	Where?
2105100	2108560	Okay, like where is the residue collecting then?
2108560	2110320	Like you've been in contention this whole time.
2110320	2114840	So like, just fucking tell me, is the residue collecting in any specific spot?
2114840	2121560	Kathy is shaking her head and she's like, I, I, and you see that Francis beans has a
2121560	2127720	lever and she is slowly lowering George piston toward this water.
2127720	2133920	George begins actually whimpering as he's lowered towards this water and Kathy looks
2133940	2135940	over at him and she's like, no, for real.
2135940	2138940	I don't know what residue you're talking about.
2138940	2141220	I don't know where it would be collecting.
2141220	2146700	I, I just, I don't think I have any of the answers that you're, and she gets cut off
2146700	2147700	by Francis again.
2147700	2148700	Who's like, yeah.
2148700	2149700	Okay.
2149700	2153260	Like seriously though, what is the circle of knowledge use the people for?
2153260	2155060	You of all people should fucking know that.
2155060	2163780	And Kathy just spits at her client confidentiality and then Francis says, all right, well, or
2164760	2165880	she's making fun of her.
2165880	2166880	Yeah.
2166880	2167880	She's mocking her.
2167880	2169720	She's mocking her whale.
2169720	2172920	Have you seen any of them silver spares?
2172920	2177820	Francis says, were they, uh, like, you know, at the circle or were they in contention?
2177820	2180480	Have you ever seen any of these things?
2180480	2184040	And Kathy's just lowers her head.
2184040	2190000	I'm not gonna George, George, I love you.
2190000	2191320	I love you.
2191320	2197300	And George is being dipped slowly into the water and as his feet touch, he starts moaning
2197300	2198300	out.
2198300	2204100	He's like, no Lord, please God, if you're out there, I would be willing if you did me
2204100	2207300	a service right now and just let me.
2207300	2211620	And Francis is laughing maniacally as she's slowly lowering it.
2211620	2214700	And if you guys are still walking, you're approaching right now.
2214700	2215700	Wow.
2215700	2218500	Yeah, you do.
2218500	2223240	I don't do anything yet, but there's still part of my brain that was a police officer
2223240	2226320	that makes me just want to fucking stop this immediately.
2226320	2230120	I'm trying to get her attention and Francis turns around and the lever stops.
2230120	2232600	So George is feeder in the water.
2232600	2236440	She turns around and she's like, Kevin, Oh, God damn it.
2236440	2237440	Nope.
2237440	2238440	What?
2238440	2239440	Just talk like you normally do.
2239440	2240440	Yeah.
2240440	2241440	You know what your normal voice.
2241440	2242440	Here's act with.
2242440	2249540	Keith fucking Figna, if it isn't you and your new best friend, Kevin, and I see we have
2249540	2253180	company finally, wait, what the fuck is he doing here?
2253180	2257460	You were in the room when Marvin told me to, uh, bring Stan Manstein back, right?
2257460	2258460	Yeah.
2258460	2259460	He killed Stan Manstein.
2259460	2260720	What the fuck?
2260720	2264120	So we're bringing him to Marvin to have a little conversation, try to figure out what
2264120	2267480	we can do if we can, you know, I just, I didn't want to come back empty handed.
2267480	2268480	So I brought you something.
2268480	2269480	All right.
2269480	2271700	Well, like you were sent down here, weren't you?
2271700	2272700	Yeah.
2272700	2273700	Okay.
2273700	2276080	Then like, I guess hang him up and we'll talk to him now.
2276080	2277080	Give me a second.
2277080	2281920	I'm trying to get something good out of these fucking contentioners.
2281920	2282920	God damn it.
2282920	2283920	Francis.
2283920	2287340	Marvin told me he needs to see you upstairs when that's a loose end.
2287340	2289920	I'm sorry.
2289920	2292120	Go about your business.
2292120	2296120	Wait, like what's the loose end?
2296120	2298300	Like when did he tell you that leaving?
2298300	2299300	I'm sorry.
2299300	2304180	I'm a little confused the past few days, but uh, the loose end I was talking about was
2304180	2306760	you leaving him here dangling, not tortured.
2306760	2309100	You should torture him a little more.
2309100	2320640	Roll persuade for me there, Thomas 37 on a 60 very nice.
2320640	2321660	I think you're right.
2321660	2326880	I think we should hang him up right now and fucking torture him until he starts talking.
2326880	2329920	So like, uh, just hold on.
2329920	2330920	Just hold on right there.
2330920	2334520	I'm seriously, I'm deadly in the middle of something right now.
2334520	2336360	And she begins lowering George.
2336360	2341840	I use my metal hand to whack her in the back of the head and try to knock her out.
2341840	2342840	Ooh, doggy.
2342840	2343840	All right.
2343840	2347800	Uh, you're going to roll unarmed combat against her unarmed combat.
2347800	2350600	Can I get a plus for my heavy metal hand?
2350600	2353800	I'll give you a plus to damage for the heavy metal hand.
2353800	2356000	So I'm rolling a unarmed.
2356000	2357000	Yep.
2357000	2360920	It's clearly armed though.
2360920	2361920	What did she roll?
2361920	2362920	She rolled a 10.
2362920	2363920	God damn it.
2363920	2366040	I rolled an 82 and a 40.
2366040	2369480	Keith, I'm going to have you roll dexterity.
2369480	2372320	It's going to be a pretty fucking important dexterity check.
2372320	2374320	What's your dexterity?
2374320	2376240	60.
2376240	2377480	And that's a 90.
2377480	2378480	Doesn't matter.
2378480	2379480	It's one 91.
2379960	2387160	Keith, as you go to whack your niece with your big old metal club hand, she uses your
2387160	2391440	momentum against you and throws you directly into the water.
2391440	2392440	God damn it.
2392440	2397520	Do I, can I do some sort of saving chance to cling onto the side?
2397520	2401120	That would have been the dexterity that you just rolled and failed.
2401120	2407080	So as you splash into the water, I need you to roll a sanity check.
2407080	2409120	Oh, just him?
2409120	2410120	Just him.
2410120	2411880	I've failed, but not over my power.
2411880	2412880	Okay.
2412880	2413880	26 on him.
2413880	2416600	Take one sanity damage.
2416600	2417600	Psychic water.
2417600	2422880	As you begin fucking panicking at the thought of what is underneath you right now.
2422880	2428880	Now with that sanity loss, what that reminds you of, do you remember what happened to your
2428880	2432080	little fish boyfriend, Peter Dieter?
2432080	2433080	Yes.
2433080	2437440	You realized that that was an extremely large tank of water.
2437440	2439040	Just like the one I'm in right now.
2439040	2444640	Yeah, which is crazy because that means that you are now swimming around with the thing
2444640	2446680	that you saw inside there.
2446680	2448640	Are these multiple tanks or one giant tank?
2448640	2452200	This is one giant tank, baby.
2452200	2456160	I want to start swimming over to the glass edge of this tank.
2456160	2458720	Oh, it is not even close.
2458720	2459960	You can't even see the edge.
2459960	2463320	I mean, how far above is the catwalk from where I am?
2463320	2464320	Five feet.
2464320	2465320	Help me.
2465600	2469360	Can I, in the confusion of his assail, heaven helps those who help themselves.
2469360	2471080	Yeah, so we are going to move on.
2471080	2472820	So Clark actually does get first action.
2472820	2475320	I would like to finish what Keith tried to do.
2475320	2477840	I want to try and knock her out.
2477840	2478840	Okay.
2478840	2479840	I'm rolling unarmed.
2479840	2480840	Hell yeah.
2480840	2484240	I rolled a six on a 70.
2484240	2485400	Describe what you would like to do.
2485400	2490440	Well, when Keith went for her and swung wide or whatever happened there, I just seized
2490440	2494780	that opportunity because she wouldn't have been looking at the prisoner and I just walk
2494780	2497460	up and wallop her.
2497460	2500540	It's just a straight punch to the side of her head.
2500540	2501540	Alrighty.
2501540	2505820	Go ahead and roll a D6 for damage here.
2505820	2506820	It's a two.
2506820	2507820	Alrighty.
2507820	2509060	You punch her in the head.
2509060	2510060	Jon, what are you doing?
2510060	2516260	I would like to use law to try and handcuff her.
2516260	2517260	Love it.
2517260	2518260	So you go to handcuff her.
2518260	2519620	Roll that law check for me.
2519620	2520620	Fuck.
2520620	2522620	94 on a 50.
2522620	2523620	So you go to hand.
2523620	2524620	Okay.
2525460	2526460	You guys curse dice.
2526460	2532980	So you guys are all standing there and Keith goes to swing at her.
2532980	2538260	She uses his momentum against him and throws him into the water below.
2538260	2543540	Clark goes swings, punches her, makes a connection as Jon goes around the back and tries to get
2543540	2545040	her hands in handcuffs.
2545040	2551660	She wriggles out of his grasp and she kind of backs away and she goes to take off running.
2551660	2554260	She's going to run toward where you guys came from.
2554900	2555900	And it is Keith's turn.
2555900	2556900	What are you doing?
2556900	2563940	I pull the big, huge gun off my back and I try to use the magazine clips to reach up
2563940	2568380	to the catwalk and, you know, kind of hike it in there and pull myself up out of the
2568380	2569380	water.
2569380	2570380	That's super cool.
2570380	2571380	That's very smart.
2571380	2577420	So I'm going to have you roll athletics in order to kick your legs hard enough to lift
2577420	2579220	your body out of the water enough.
2579220	2580220	Fucking shit.
2580220	2581220	Oh boy.
2581220	2582620	It's a crit fail.
2582620	2583620	55 on a 50.
2584620	2586100	Oh damn.
2586100	2587100	Right there.
2587100	2588780	I'm going to use different dice.
2588780	2598500	Keith, as you move your gun into position, the clip lodges itself into the catwalk and
2598500	2604520	you accidentally click, I'm guessing, a button on a gun that makes a clip pop out and then
2604520	2608940	the gun slips out of your hands and falls into the water out of your...
2608940	2610940	It's strapped on my back though.
2610940	2611940	You rolled a crit fail.
2612260	2615220	And you took it off your back too.
2615220	2619060	I like where your head's at, but you done fucked up and you lost your gun.
2619060	2624720	It's in the water and it is floating down into the darkness past where you can see.
2624720	2628580	You can barely see your feet in this murky, dark green water.
2628580	2631700	And above you, this clip is lodged into the catwalk.
2631700	2633300	Clark, it is your turn.
2633300	2635260	I'm going to rush her again.
2635260	2636260	Okay.
2636260	2637260	She is running away from you currently.
2637260	2638260	Oh, that's right.
2638260	2639260	I forgot she was running away.
2639260	2640260	Do you want to chase after her?
2640260	2641260	Yeah.
2641580	2642820	What kind of role would I need for that?
2642820	2644900	Do I have a run skill?
2644900	2648780	You would be, well, just tell me what you're going to do and then we'll figure it out from
2648780	2649780	there.
2649780	2650780	Well, okay.
2650780	2651780	The problem is that...
2651780	2652780	What would Clark do?
2652780	2655700	You can look at your athletics to know how well you'd hold up in a race.
2655700	2660980	I've got an idea of what Jon would do that wouldn't take any time or action away from
2660980	2661980	his turn.
2661980	2662980	I just want to shout at her.
2662980	2663980	Know what I'm going to do?
2663980	2665380	I'm going to turn and help Keith out of the pool.
2665380	2666380	Yeah.
2666380	2667980	Take that free action and go ahead and holler.
2667980	2668980	Francis!
2668980	2669980	Francis!
2669980	2671260	The blood just got riled up.
2671260	2672260	You know, family.
2672260	2674620	And he's just, you know, he was just trying to wrestle around.
2674620	2675620	Get back here.
2675620	2677220	You've got torturing to do.
2677220	2679060	All right.
2679060	2680660	So let's get that roll.
2680660	2683220	How are you helping Keith out of the pool?
2683220	2687020	I'll lay belly on the catwalk and reach my hands down toward him.
2687020	2688020	All right.
2688020	2692420	Keith, I'm going to have you roll luck for a timing situation here.
2692420	2693420	Nope.
2693420	2694900	54 and a 35.
2694900	2695900	Amazing.
2695900	2698400	And Thomas, do you want to do anything else with your turn here?
2698400	2701120	Can I do a persuade roll on yelling at her?
2701120	2702120	Yeah, absolutely.
2702120	2703120	Yeah.
2703120	2704120	51 on a 60.
2704120	2705120	All righty.
2705120	2708440	And she rolled a 98 to try to fight your persuade.
2708440	2711560	And so she stops and she turns around.
2711560	2716440	She's like, crushed her in my mind vice.
2716440	2723520	She's like, God damn it, Kevin, you know how much I like really like torturing.
2723520	2724520	Yeah.
2724520	2725800	And you know Keith's an idiot.
2725800	2728320	Why don't you come, you know, look, he's in this water.
2728320	2731000	Come get him, help get him out and then you can torture.
2731000	2736400	As she's running back toward you, she's yelling at you and she's like, get your prisoner,
2736400	2737600	handcuff him.
2737600	2743160	And so you, your attempt to handcuff her was so piss poor that she didn't even realize
2743160	2745440	you were trying to handcuff her.
2745440	2749560	And so she's now telling you to get ahold of the prisoner that you had.
2749560	2750560	Right.
2750560	2752720	The person I just tried to handcuff.
2752720	2753720	Exactly.
2753720	2756560	What a persuade roll you had and two in a row.
2756560	2758240	I'll definitely count all that.
2758240	2763960	So Keith, I swim over to the chain that George is hanging from.
2763960	2764960	So smart.
2764960	2770160	And I try to crawl up him and up onto the chain in order to at least one, get out of
2770160	2772620	the water, two to try to get to the catwalk.
2772620	2780100	And with that absolutely dog shit luck roll that you had earlier, that was for the timing
2780100	2782320	of the whole situation.
2782320	2793720	And looking down as you hold on to the body of George piston, you feel this movement from
2793720	2801940	underneath you and you can hear water moving at a rapid pace and looking down, you actually
2801940	2805480	see the creature.
2805480	2811440	It is moving so quickly toward you that all of the grime in the water that is in between
2811440	2814860	you and it is starting to dissipate as it's coming toward you.
2814860	2820300	And you see a clear picture of one of these mutated fish men.
2820300	2826140	But like the one that you saw earlier, it looks exactly like the ones in the Brown jumpsuits,
2826140	2829780	but it is four times larger.
2829780	2836360	And both of its legs are kind of like welded together like this one giant fin.
2836360	2841720	It opens its maw and swims up right at you.
2841720	2842720	Clark it's your turn.
2842720	2843720	What are you doing?
2843720	2846660	You're hanging over the side, but Keith swim away from you.
2846660	2851240	Fuck, I guess I'm standing up.
2851240	2853740	I heard the exchange about the cuff thing.
2853740	2854980	And so I'm going to try and play it cool.
2854980	2858140	I'm just going to stand back up and that's it.
2858140	2859260	I mean, yeah.
2859260	2861940	I yell at Francis, he shot in the leg.
2861940	2862940	He can't get away.
2862940	2864300	Help me get Keith now.
2864300	2871540	She begins running up toward you and Kathy Piston is crying.
2871540	2875960	George Piston is hollering to his God.
2875960	2881900	Keith Vigna is crawling up the body of George Piston.
2881900	2887420	Clark Bishop is standing on the catwalk with his hands behind his back.
2887420	2891920	And Francis beans is running toward Kevin in her eyes.
2891920	2901260	John Lee Pettymore to try to grab Keith when all of a sudden this giant fish mouth comes
2901260	2910300	up from in between the catwalk grid and grabs wholly on to George Piston's body, closes
2910300	2914880	its mouth and dips back into the water.
2914880	2921480	The fish hook is just hanging right above the water covered in blood.
2921480	2926580	And there's a giant splash in the water hits all of your feet.
2926580	2934200	And the four of you stand there in the wake of the disappearance of Keith Vigna and George
2934200	2935200	Piston.
2935200	2936200	Oh no.
2936200	2953680	I bet I could have helped hear more.
2966200	2995880	How am I the only one trying to fool over How can you have enough trying to get me to
2995880	2996880	the end?
2996880	2996880
