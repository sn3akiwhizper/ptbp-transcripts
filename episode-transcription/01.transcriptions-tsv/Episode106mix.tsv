0	5720	Well bake me a cookie and call me a monster, because I'm here to gobble y'all up.
5720	7480	Nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom
7480	14720	It's your dessert demon daddy, Wolf the Dog, and I'm here to consume your delicious sugary morsels.
14720	23800	I am coming at you live from 694.2 PTBP, the only radio station that runs off of pure glucose.
23800	30120	Fill me up a tub with maple syrup, because it's time to relax and check in with our newest segment,
30120	31640	Howlin' with Wolf.
31640	36360	This Howlin' with Wolf comes from Zachary Fredrickson in Phoenix, Arizona,
36360	39800	who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod.
39800	46640	The quickest way to tell your friends you're a nerd who loves putting apples where you can't tan without some effort.
46640	51000	Thanks to Zachary for doing that, and what a great name too.
51000	52720	Anywho, he writes,
52720	60360	I wanna thank my pal, Eld, from the Lancer and PTBP discords for getting me into the show.
60360	64880	And the boys from Contention for getting me into Delta Green as a whole.
64880	72640	I've been a handler for a few times now, and using the lessons I've learned by listening means it's always a great time.
72640	76160	Eld, we gotta play together again sometime.
76160	80320	If anybody was interested in a different type of actual play,
80320	90240	check out at FTLcast on Twitter for a ton of great GM-less role-playing games and LGBTQ plus voices.
90240	91720	Keep it up, boys!
91720	93760	Thanks for writin' in, Zachary.
93760	100320	I've only met one other Zachary in my entire life, and I've gotta say, wasn't a big fan.
100320	103680	But you, Zachary, I'm a big fan of yours.
103680	105960	Thanks for writin' in, buddy.
106000	109920	But to that other Zach, you know who you are.
109920	113120	And you know I'm comin' for you, baby.
113120	117000	If you wanna write up something for your sugary sweet wolf to howl,
117000	121160	go ahead and write up a five-star review on Apple Podcasts,
121160	125320	and email a screenshot to pretendingpod at gmail.com,
125320	131440	or tag at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter, and seriously, it's time.
131480	136080	I know you've been considerin' it for a while, and never took the initiative,
136080	142600	but it's time to demand that your friends, coworkers, and baristas start listenin' to this show.
142600	146680	Think of how easy it would be to have conversations with them
146680	150480	if they could debate who the worst cop in contention is,
150480	155800	or what's goin' on with Maggie Cook, or what the fuck I am,
155800	161040	all while you listen to Justin's original soundtrack on our YouTube page.

180560	186200	The Segway is a two-wheeled, self-balancing personal transporter
186200	189160	brought to market in 2001.
189160	191640	And this is the news.
191640	198200	Last time, the group relived a short chunk of time thanks to the chantin' of Don D. Pettymore.
198200	204840	The second attempt was much better for Keith Beans and much, much worse for Jack Russell,
204840	207760	who was skewered by the rabbit ball.
207760	214840	After John Lee Kevinmore the 3rd realized his goo magic is perhaps endlessly powerful,
214880	220960	He created a portal to the other stilted bunker, where Keith had just walked through the hatch door.
220960	228280	Clark and John narrowly escaped the wild ball, leaving Leo Piston to yet another hellish experience.
228280	235480	Don D followed the boys into this new plane of existence, and John closed the gate behind them.
235480	242840	Standing on glowing ground, they saw a towering building made of darkness in the distance.
242840	248280	More attention, though, was paid to the monumental pipe floating above them.
248280	254120	The inside walls of this tube exude the same bright light they all stand on,
254120	260040	and lumbering across the luminous land of this cylinder is an indescribable beast.
260040	264920	Taking us now to the scene of a literally breathtaking roar
264920	270040	is Dragon N3 with What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?
272840	283800	Bad girls on top of the water, Mary and Caroline I'm on the borderline
283800	291800	Leaving my mind at your altar Crossing the double line, doing it every time
291800	297800	Tell me, what kind of world are you livin' in?
300600	306600	What kind of world are you livin' in?
309240	321720	Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1st and 2nd Samuel, 1st and 2nd Kings, 1st and 2nd Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Limitations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos,

337720	343160	No, it's Justin, Joe, Luke, Thomas, and Zach.
343160	344920	He always mixes that up though.
344920	346120	That's who's in the call tonight.
346120	348280	I've just gotten used to it.
348280	352200	Philemon, please roll sanity.
352200	354800	I've made a turnaround, guys.
354800	356880	You're like way into Jesus again.
356880	364400	I'm like super into Jesus again, and I think that we need to cleanse this show of our wickedness
364400	370720	in our terrible, terrible, sinful ways, and I think we should start off this episode with
370720	371720	a prayer.
371720	372720	I'm good.
372720	373840	Okay, perfect.
373840	375960	That means you're in, right?
375960	377600	Hold on.
377600	383520	This is really weird, but my cousin literally just texted me and said this, got high and
383520	384720	had ideas.
384720	389680	What if the Carcano rifle Oswald used was a gun in a Delta Green setting, and every
389680	392800	third bullet was magic?
392800	399440	That's a good Delta Green gun.
399440	402800	Did H.W. Bush cast the spell on the gun?
402800	405760	Yeah, I don't know Delta Green lore.
405760	410720	Zach, do you think God could make an apple so big that even he couldn't fit it up his
410720	414720	ass?
414720	419960	No.
419960	423120	There's nothing too big that it couldn't fit up God's ass.
423120	427280	There's no problem too big for that.
427280	432000	I think G.K. Chesterton and C.S. Lewis argued about that point a lot.
432000	434960	Yeah, who won?
434960	435960	The apple.
435960	438680	Yeah, the apple always wins.
438680	446680	When there's one set of footprints, C.S. Lewis won, I think.
446680	448680	Dear Father God.
448680	454080	Are you one of the, are you the poopy kind?
454080	459080	No, no, more of a Paul guy than a Peter guy, personally.
459080	462800	This is like when you asked us to roleplay playing golf.
462800	468480	You guys should get more hobbies, like...
468480	469480	Golf and religion.
469480	470480	Golf and religion.
470480	473480	That's the kind of guy I would love to do.
473480	479520	You guys should really expand your world view into more like traditional white American
479520	485280	things like fundamentalist Christianity and golf.
485280	487760	Wouldn't kill you all to broaden your horizons.
487760	494360	All I'm thinking about is how many golf balls versus apples and there's a lot, a lot more
494360	496500	golf balls you could fit in there.
496500	497980	So maybe I will take it up.
497980	503360	They do flush golf balls down toilets to show like how, how much water pressure there is
503360	504360	or whatever.
504360	506920	And toilets are kind of like butts because you poop into them.
506920	507960	Wait, I'm sorry, what?
507960	510840	You know, like they show like the water pressure or whatever.
510840	514360	They put a bunch of golf balls in a toilet and flush it and it's like, look how much
514360	516320	stuff you can flush down this toilet.
516320	518800	Because you got to see how powerful that flush is.
518800	519800	You got to know.
519800	521640	I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
521640	525560	It sounds like a guy just came over to your house and like pranked you.
525560	526560	Like what?
526560	528880	He's like, yeah, I'm a plumber, but really it was just like doing everything you could
528880	529880	to break your toilet.
529880	530880	Right.
530880	531880	And he put a little...
531880	532880	Yeah.
532880	537920	We call this the golf ball test.
537920	538920	Look it up.
538920	541280	Golf balls and toilets is the thing.
541280	542880	You can't run with us.
542880	543880	All right.
543880	544880	Uh, let's...
545280	546280	Are you okay, Zach?
546280	554680	You had like a real flustered moment after that.
554680	557440	It sounds to me like Justin's not a part of the turbo team.
557440	564360	Uh, let's go ahead and get into the, what happened at the end of last session, which
564360	572000	is that John created a fucking portal, uh, with his goo magic.
572000	573000	What are you calling that, Thomas?
573000	574580	Does that, does that sound right?
574580	580100	You know, my, my ooze abilities, my, I guess we would say muck magic for alliteration,
580100	581100	but we've never called it the muck.
581100	583700	I like alliteration clearly this arc.
583700	585560	Muck sounds like something fun we could call it.
585560	589260	That's also like down homie and would be appropriate for these characters.
589260	590260	Muck magic.
590260	591260	I like that a whole lot.
591260	592260	Muck magic.
592260	594060	We're fighting the muck, but I guess I'm from the muck.
594060	595940	I always knew that.
595940	597060	How do you feel right now?
597060	601140	You just said without thinking about it, talking about the current campaign, we're fighting
601140	602140	the muck.
602140	607380	Uh, there's a bit of a two minded nature there happening within you, I'd imagine.
607380	609380	No, no, no real conflicts.
609380	610380	Okay.
610380	611380	All right.
611380	612380	Good.
612380	613380	Good.
613380	614380	Very straightforward stuff.
614380	619100	You know, you can put, you could, John, John Lee Pettymore is a very strong personality
619100	622180	and it doesn't really matter what form you put it in.
622180	624620	It's pretty sure it's John.
624620	626060	What's your goal though?
626060	630980	Well, you know, even if I was made of this world, I'm from our world.
630980	633500	I'm our, I'm fighting for it.
633500	634780	I'm with us.
634780	635820	The muck needs to go back.
635820	638220	I'm not going to go, you know, I'm one of the good ones.
638220	639220	That's the right answer.
639220	640220	You can stay.
640220	647900	So you guys make it through this portal and into a new world that Keith has seemingly
647900	650360	led you through this hatch.
650360	657100	You heard a ring-a-ding-ding from the other side of this door that you then walked into.
657100	663460	John closed the portal behind you and the hatch door that you walked through disappeared
663460	665740	along with it.
665740	672140	And as you guys look around, you see the ground you all stand on.
672140	673820	It's made of light.
673820	680680	There's a soft glow that illuminates this new world from below and every direction surrounding
680680	684940	you, what could be called the ground meets what could be called the sky.
684940	688620	And it's this blacker than black opaque darkness.
688620	695180	And there's nothing on the horizon except for a single imposing building way off in
695180	697980	the distance, dimly lit from below.
697980	705820	But you can see that it's a slightly shiny pitch black, which I think would trigger your
705820	713480	memories back to a specific picture that you found inside Julie Maxwell's crashed vehicle.
713480	718100	But Keith doesn't notice any of that because he is staring straight up and each of you
718100	724640	understand why he hasn't stopped staring when you follow his gaze up into a tube of pure
724640	726800	light hanging above.
726800	733320	The interior wall of this incandescent pipe is made of the same light you currently stand
733320	740240	on and there seems to be only complete darkness beyond its well lit passage.
740240	745200	So imagine, yeah, someone who is just extremely massive out of this world bigger than you
745200	751880	is holding a them sized toilet paper roll above the world that you are in.
751880	757880	The interior of the toilet paper roll is made of this pure light, but the outside of it
757880	760260	is made out of pure darkness.
760260	765640	And so you can see up through it past all the light is darkness as well.
765640	773560	And inside this immense, resplendent toilet paper holder, consistently plotting the glowing
773560	780120	terrain somehow simultaneously moving toward you and staying at a uniform range, there's
780120	787200	this towering, lumbering beast seemingly made of the darkness that surrounds everything
787200	788320	in this place.
788320	796280	It walks on two massive legs the size of trees, its broad shoulders swing back and forth high
796280	798780	above the glossy ground.
798780	806200	As you all stare, its image seems to form and reform over and over like incomprehensible
806200	810600	little glitches and you cannot fully make sense of its shape.
810600	815120	Real quick, I'm not getting, I don't have a clear picture of the tube.
815120	818280	Can you do it one more time or tell it to me in a different way?
818280	820960	Yeah, I don't actually either understand.
820960	825040	This creature is walking on the light plane inside the tube?
825040	834320	Yeah, so imagine that gravity is pulling everything inside this tube to the walls of the tube,
834320	835540	the internal walls.
835540	840220	So this thing's walking on a different level of gravity from you guys.
840220	845780	It's walking down, but it is clearly like on the wall of the tube.
845780	847380	Like a hamster wheel?
847380	850020	Yeah, like a sideways hamster wheel.
850020	855940	So imagine that this notebook is what you guys are standing on, okay?
855940	862780	Now above you is the toilet, I'm holding up a toilet paper roll above the notebook.
862780	870860	From where you are, you can see all around, you basically just see a circle, like an oval
870860	872980	in the sky made of light.
872980	878820	But then as it moves around, this thing is not stagnant, it's kind of moving.
878820	884560	It is always directly above you and also very much not all at the same time.
884560	890320	So it is a round circle that then you can see as you're looking straight up, you are
890320	897720	seeing the inside of this tube as well as through the tube into the darkness that is
897720	898920	above it.
898920	905300	Now inside the tube, if you guys are looking straight up, there is this creature inside
905300	907520	the tube and it's massive.
907520	916420	And I imagine the tube to be gargantuan in nature, we're talking hundreds of yards across.
916420	922300	So this creature, while not taking up a ton of room inside of this tube, also you can
922300	925440	see how huge this thing is.
925440	930820	The creature is walking along it, but it could also be walking along this side or across
930820	937340	the top or across the other side or across the bottom, always seemingly lumbering toward
937340	942300	you and keeping the exact same distance away from you all at the exact same time.
942300	943380	Is it bipedal?
943380	944500	It is bipedal.
944500	948140	Its feet are rooted on whatever side it's on, but its head is always in the middle.
948140	949140	Yes.
949140	950140	Cool.
950140	951860	Which means that this thing is fucking huge.
951860	952860	Good screenshots, Luke.
952860	953860	Thank you.
953860	956380	I knew those would come in handy.
956380	957380	Does that make more sense?
957380	959460	It does make more sense, for sure.
959460	961900	Everyone notices, everyone rolls sanity.
961900	968820	What about those of us that have maybe very little sanity?
968820	969820	I failed.
969820	972860	You should have rolled a three like me.
972860	976460	I grabbed a different character sheet just off the top of a pile of character sheets
976460	979020	and I was like, how do I have fucking 40 sanity?
979020	980340	I'm kicking ass right now.
980340	984060	Oh no, I've only got 10.
984060	992180	Justin, Dondi Pettymore looks up and just has this like, of fucking course reaction.
992180	993180	I failed my sanity.
993180	995700	I failed, but not over my power.
995700	998780	John Lee Kevinmore the third loses zero sanity.
998780	1004620	He just sees the agitation on the faces of those around him as they show the telltale
1004620	1007700	signs of losing a little bit of their minds.
1007700	1010460	And he then becomes agitated because it's like, what?
1010460	1015980	Come on, guys, we go through this shit every day at this point.
1015980	1021220	It's good to be in a game where you present a very, what you think is a very cool monster
1021220	1029420	and then someone succeeds on their sanity check and says, I'm over it.
1029420	1033900	It's not even, it's not even, you know, of course it's a cool monster, but like, is it
1033900	1034900	breaking?
1034900	1038180	Why is it still breaking your minds?
1038180	1040980	Get over the world you knew and embrace, embrace the muck.
1040980	1043140	Keith Vigna lose one sanity.
1043140	1046280	Clark Bishop sees something a little bit different.
1046280	1051640	Not only does Clark see what this is, but he also sees the history that he has with
1051640	1052640	this creature.
1052640	1056040	So I need you to roll a D4.
1056040	1057040	It's a two.
1057040	1058400	Lose two sanity.
1058400	1063120	Hey, uh, Don, what did that phone look like?
1063120	1066760	It looked like a old, like old school rotary phone.
1066760	1069720	So that's not, that's not the phone we're looking for, is it?
1069720	1072560	No, I do not think so.
1072560	1075360	I can't say that that looks much like a rotary phone.
1075440	1077240	I start running towards the building.
1077240	1081360	Can we hear anything in this space other than the roars of the monster?
1081360	1084540	There's a slight hum in the air in the distance.
1084540	1090240	It's not completely silent, but you can't make out what the hum in the distance is.
1090240	1091240	Where are they?
1091240	1093360	Where are they?
1093360	1094800	Where is who, Clark?
1094800	1095840	The circle.
1095840	1097700	The last time I was here, the circle was here.
1097700	1098700	They were chanting.
1098700	1101040	They were chanting to keep this creature at bay.
1101040	1102040	I don't, I don't see them.
1102040	1103040	I don't hear them.
1103040	1104040	Where are they?
1104040	1105040	This can't be good.
1105220	1106220	This can't be right.
1106220	1107220	This can't be right.
1107220	1108220	This can't be right.
1108220	1109220	This can't be right.
1109220	1110220	This can't be right.
1110220	1111220	This can't be right.
1111220	1112220	That's the thing.
1112220	1113220	That's the thing I've been telling you guys about.
1113220	1114220	And the circle was keeping it here.
1114220	1115220	And if they're not here, I don't, I don't know what's, I don't know what's going to
1115220	1116220	happen.
1116220	1117220	I don't know what's going on here.
1117220	1118220	Do you remember what they were chanting?
1118220	1120480	Hey handler, can I, Joe doesn't for sure.
1120480	1122980	Could Clark do a role to see if he remembers?
1122980	1123980	Yes.
1123980	1132720	Do an intelligence at a, okay, I'm going to do negative 20 for how many lives you've lived
1132720	1134360	since then.
1134360	1141100	Another negative 20 for seeing this thing and being in its presence and then a third
1141100	1151080	negative 20 for the sheer horror of being sent to another realm by a little bug that
1151080	1153080	was attached to your foot.
1153080	1158820	So I've got a 55 so I can only crit fail this.
1158820	1159820	It's a 29.
1159820	1160820	Okay.
1160820	1168380	I thought I was giving you like a slight chance, not a zero chance, but even if it was negative
1168380	1169380	40, he would have failed.
1169380	1171620	No, I can't for the life of me remember what they were saying.
1171620	1173300	I didn't really care about chance back then.
1173300	1174340	I wasn't paying attention.
1174340	1179140	Your mind was like fucking split in half in that moment when, when you got sent to this
1179140	1183140	other plane of existence for a moment, honestly, I've been kind of hoping I could run into
1183140	1187340	some of those circle of knowledge guys while we were here and they'd help us get back.
1187340	1189980	So that kind of blows my pant plan out to shit.
1189980	1191460	I don't, I don't know what's going on now.
1191460	1195700	Well, I mean, if we could remember that chant, maybe, you know, we could go back and grab
1195700	1201180	Leo and sit him here to die for eternity while he chants it, or we could at least say something
1201180	1202180	temporarily.
1202180	1204100	It seems like that's kind of a dead end though.
1204100	1207860	Yeah, it'd be a good idea if I could just remember that damn chant.
1207860	1209860	How far away has Keith gotten?
1209860	1212380	I was going to say, am I actually making progress?
1212380	1213380	Yeah.
1213420	1217780	The world around you guys is stretching as Keith is running away from you.
1217780	1221540	In my vision, is the building getting any closer to me?
1221540	1223680	Yeah, ever so slightly.
1223680	1227660	And then all of a sudden I need Thomas and Joe and Justin to take their headphones off.
1227660	1230300	Uh oh, I hope I'm alive when they get back.
1230300	1236620	Well, at least one of you probably will be as you are running.
1236660	1246380	You are completely caught off guard by this humanoid figure hanging by its ankles.
1246380	1253380	Some darkness has pulled itself and you see it's holding on to the bone right above the
1253380	1260820	ankle and it is rubbed down through this man's pants to where the pants are cut and it is
1260820	1262460	rubbed through the skin.
1262460	1268300	There's blood pouring down the man's legs up toward his torso and then onto his face,
1268300	1273180	a face that you recognize that is beet red.
1273180	1280260	And there are two belts pulled tightly around his neck.
1280260	1286700	The word fool is branded on his forehead.
1287460	1298380	And Keith beans, you are looking directly into the face of Keith beans, your own face,
1298380	1300720	maybe a year or two older.
1300720	1307300	And he is wearing clothes that you recognize as clothes that you wore when you were going
1307300	1310220	under the name Silas Cole.
1310220	1311220	Damn.
1311220	1316860	Well, so I'm running and this thing like just pops up in front of me and I smack right
1316860	1318620	into the body.
1318620	1324900	It takes me a second to realize and I look down and he's dead obviously, right?
1324900	1325900	He's not.
1325900	1327340	His face is completely red.
1327340	1332180	You've you've kind of woken him up and you said he has two belts around his neck, two
1332180	1335020	belts around his neck, no belts on his pants.
1335020	1340740	I look and I see the belts and I want to try to like get them from around his neck, like
1340740	1346340	take them off.
1346340	1350060	Are you, who are you?
1350060	1352980	Who are you?
1352980	1354380	His eyes get huge.
1354380	1355380	Keith.
1355380	1356380	Yeah, that's me.
1356380	1357380	It's me.
1357380	1358380	It's you.
1358380	1359380	It's me.
1359380	1365700	Are you, are you Keith or are you, are you Silas?
1365700	1366700	Yes.
1366700	1369100	How'd you get here?
1369140	1371140	She threw me through the hole.
1371140	1372140	Who did?
1372140	1374540	She threw me through the hole in the ground.
1374540	1375540	Mary.
1375540	1376540	Mary.
1376540	1378100	How long you been here for?
1378100	1382340	Oh, I guess that'd be like a bunch of years, right?
1382340	1383340	Uh huh.
1383340	1384340	Yeah, a bunch.
1384340	1389820	Uh, you, he like tries to reach out to grab you and you see like his hands have been hanging
1389820	1393620	down to the ground below his head for who knows how long.
1393620	1394620	They're completely red.
1394620	1397860	Uh, he seems to have no use of the fingers.
1397860	1404060	So he's just kind of like prodding at you, uh, with these unmoving phalanges.
1404060	1411340	And he's like, let me try to get you down.
1411340	1412940	Get the blood out of your head.
1412940	1419100	I want to like touch the goo, whatever is holding him up is, am I able to manipulate
1419100	1420100	it at all?
1420100	1421100	Yeah, it's malleable enough.
1421100	1422100	You can manipulate it.
1422100	1425820	I just try to pull him down and like stretch it out enough to where it breaks.
1425820	1431220	Yeah, it's, it's honestly, it's being hung up by nothingness up into the air, up into
1431220	1438100	the sky around you as if, uh, it is, it stretches out and then kind of snaps.
1438100	1440580	I'm thinking like laughing, like Laffy Taffy.
1440580	1442740	If you like stretched out Laffy Taffy.
1442740	1443740	Yes.
1443740	1446060	Perfectly dark Laffy Taffy.
1446060	1448660	I don't know what, stand up.
1448660	1451620	Can you stand up?
1451620	1456020	There is no blood in the whole bottom half of his body.
1456020	1463260	And so as he's trying to stand up, I start massaging him from his head down to try to
1463260	1464260	put the blood back down.
1464260	1476660	Yeah, I think like this seems like, that seems like the perfect moment for the rest of the
1476660	1480460	group to come up and meet you.
1480460	1483620	Tell you they're sorry.
1483620	1497100	Okay, uh, Luke, go ahead and take off your headphones for a second while they catch up
1497100	1498340	with you.
1498340	1499340	Real quick.
1499340	1503180	In all that time you were just with Luke, did he make it to, um, did we see him like
1503180	1504180	go in the tower?
1504180	1505220	No, no, no, no.
1505220	1509580	He made it about a third of the way before you see that there's something else in the
1509580	1514100	distance that he is, he's dealing with, uh, another body there.
1514100	1521580	Uh, it was hanging upside down at first and then he like pulls it down to the ground.
1521580	1527060	And then as you continue approaching, he kind of gets it up onto its feet.
1527060	1528780	Can we make out the figure from here?
1528780	1530500	Do we, is it a person?
1530500	1534860	If you guys get to the point to where you can make out who it is, then I'll have Luke
1534900	1537620	back on the call cause you guys will be within earshot.
1537620	1538620	I'm good with that.
1538620	1539820	Is Don with us?
1539820	1540820	Yes.
1540820	1542020	What about mentally?
1542020	1545020	Not so much.
1545020	1549780	Don's kind of muttering to himself about like the phone over and over again.
1549780	1554020	Now that we've come in here, he's like, where, why did the phones, I thought we heard the
1554020	1555020	phone in here.
1555020	1558260	I don't, we need to find the phone.
1558260	1562820	He's staring at the tube still while you guys are talking and muttering to himself about
1562820	1563820	the phone.
1563860	1567740	Good point Don, we did hear the phone from in here, so presumably the phone is somewhere
1567740	1569740	around here.
1569740	1573460	Yeah, we gotta, we gotta find, we gotta find that phone.
1573460	1575820	John, your friends are weird.
1575820	1581180	I think we need to get together and use this here petty more magic that we possess.
1581180	1586340	I've been calling it muck magic, but I've taken to calling it as of late.
1586340	1587340	That's wonderful.
1587340	1588340	That's beautiful.
1588340	1591540	Hey, you know, you know, Uncle Don, you seem, you seem just a little bit rattled.
1591540	1596940	My muck magic, my, my spider senses, as it were, they're kind of sending me towards a
1596940	1597940	Keith's direction.
1597940	1601220	I think we should maybe go check that out and see, see if he's sure these friends of
1601220	1602220	yours are reliable.
1602220	1603860	We got an important mission right now.
1603860	1605100	We got to find that phone.
1605100	1606100	Oh Lord.
1606100	1611600	No, but they are definitely connected with the phone and everything.
1611600	1616160	So like it's, we sticking with them is probably the best direction towards that.
1616160	1617740	If you think so.
1617740	1618740	We got it.
1618740	1619740	We got to find that phone.
1619740	1620740	All right.
1620940	1628620	So like I said, my, my, my muck Dar, my, my, my tingly connection to this world, you know,
1628620	1630100	it seems to be pointing me towards Keith.
1630100	1631100	Let's just head that way.
1631100	1635340	And I grabbed him by the shoulder and I kind of, I kind of push him towards that direction
1635340	1637220	and start walking with him and guiding him.
1637220	1641260	I slap his arm off me and walk that direction by myself.
1641260	1643980	Such a healthy family relationship.
1643980	1649860	Not like a mean slap, but you know, I'm like, yeah, like uncles do.
1649860	1654260	You know, an uncle slap.
1654260	1660740	The three of you approach a site that I'm going to let Keith describe or Luke rather.
1660740	1668260	So you see a man sitting on the ground in front of Keith and Keith is putting his hands
1668260	1671900	around the man's head like this.
1671900	1674220	We can see that, but you're going to have to describe it for the listeners.
1674220	1676580	He's like two hand jerking off the whole head.
1676580	1677580	Yeah.
1677580	1682740	Like massaging his head with his hands around his head and like pushing down and then like
1682740	1690820	going down his shoulders or like up his hands and down his body and like rubbing him down.
1690820	1698300	And then as you get closer, you see that the man in front of him on the ground has just
1698300	1701100	looks like all the blood is in his head.
1701100	1706060	And after you kind of get over that, like the kind of purpley red on his full forehead
1706060	1709540	is the brand fool.
1709540	1715420	And after you see all that, you realize that the man is Keith beans.
1715420	1718140	Oh shit.
1718140	1720300	But he's got some old timey clothing on.
1720300	1721300	Oh shit.
1721300	1723740	Is he like visibly older or?
1723740	1726580	Few years I think is what, not much.
1726580	1729940	Is he responding to our Keith's touch at all?
1729940	1730940	Oh yeah.
1730940	1731940	Thank you.
1731940	1733940	Thank you Keith.
1733940	1734940	This is getting out of hand.
1734940	1736940	Now there's two of them.
1736940	1737940	Guys.
1737940	1739860	I found me.
1739860	1741500	It's Silas Cole.
1741500	1742500	Yeah.
1742500	1747900	What happened to make you sound like that?
1747900	1752620	And he points it to belts that are on the ground and he points at his neck.
1752620	1756180	He had these belts around his neck and he was hanging upside down and I'm just trying
1756180	1759620	to get the blood back down into the rest of his body.
1759620	1764140	And I'm still massaging his head.
1764140	1772020	Oh God.
1772020	1777940	I forget Keith that you did pass that EMT class so you do know exactly what to do in
1777940	1778940	these situations.
1778940	1784380	Hey Silas, Silas, Keith, put your arm, raise your arms up so the blood goes down into the
1784380	1786380	rest of your body.
1786380	1787660	His arms go up in the air.
1787660	1793100	Keith, why does, why does Silas Cole look, it's you, but you said it's Silas.
1793100	1794900	I don't, I don't understand.
1794900	1797660	I thought I had told you this before, but.
1797660	1798660	Yeah, you have.
1798660	1802740	I'm just, I'm as Clark seeing two Keith's before him and you're calling one Silas.
1802740	1804700	I feel like it needs to be reiterated.
1804700	1812420	Well, just, he's Silas and I'm Keith, but I'm, I'm remembering now as a, as I see it,
1812420	1816900	as I see him, uh, he said he got thrown into a hole and that's how he got here.
1816900	1824180	And I remember when I was him, I got thrown in to a hole by Mary.
1824180	1829140	But if I was him, but I'm me, but I.
1829140	1830940	When did, when were you him?
1830940	1836500	Uh, well, a long time ago, right?
1836500	1837500	Roll sanity.
1837500	1848420	Thomas, I'm sorry to bring it up again, but can you move the microphone in a better position
1848420	1849420	for you?
1849420	1853060	Uh, I, yeah, it's that or me like breathing right into the mic.
1853060	1854060	Like yeah.
1854060	1855060	Okay.
1855060	1856060	I get that.
1856060	1859100	It's just, when you do lean forward, then we get really, really good audio.
1859100	1861060	But then when you don't, it isn't good.
1861060	1863060	Yeah, I understand what you mean.
1863060	1868580	But I think you're a great person and you're a good friend and a great role player.
1868580	1869580	And I love you.
1869580	1870580	I love you too.
1870580	1874100	But I do take that all intensely personally and I'll never forgive you.
1874100	1875100	Good.
1875100	1876100	Good.
1876100	1877100	That seems, that seems perfect.
1877100	1878100	That seems right.
1878100	1880940	But I, I have learned my lesson and I'll definitely just keep all that in mind and not like I'll
1880940	1882980	keep that in practice.
1882980	1888020	Luca, how'd you do on the sanity check?
1888020	1889500	I failed.
1889500	1890500	Regular fail.
1890500	1891500	Okay.
1891940	1896580	Just lose one sanity is you can't remember when you were Silas or when you were you and
1896580	1900200	you think maybe that you're both at the same time right now.
1900200	1901200	Isn't that you?
1901200	1902200	I mean, it is you.
1902200	1903200	Yeah.
1903200	1905900	I look at, I look at him and I punched myself in the stomach.
1905900	1906900	Did that hurt?
1906900	1907900	No.
1907900	1908900	Okay.
1908900	1909900	Just.
1909900	1920220	But I, there's so much pain going on in my throat and my head that I don't know if a
1920220	1923060	stomach punch would really do much damage right now.
1923060	1926940	I start rubbing his throat like you would a dog that you're trying to get to swallow
1926940	1930940	a pill.
1930940	1934820	Remember in Looper when they torture that guy by like removing parts of him in a different
1934820	1938780	time and all of a sudden his little bits are gone in this time?
1938780	1939780	That shit was crazy.
1939780	1940780	That was crazy.
1940780	1944780	God, I hope that doesn't happen to us.
1944780	1948980	Just something to keep in mind if you ever, you know, get out of line, Silas.
1948980	1956220	Not that we have that capability, but come on, you know, we could figure it out.
1956220	1958620	You're a past version of, of Arky.
1958620	1959620	Do you know us?
1959620	1961620	Do you, are you, do you know who I am?
1961620	1962620	Yeah.
1962620	1963620	You're the overseer.
1963620	1969260	Oh, you know me as the overseer.
1969260	1970260	That's that's, that's kind of.
1970260	1971260	No, you're Clark Bishop.
1971260	1972260	You're my partner.
1972260	1975260	But we talked about it like, oh, who's the chosen one?
1975260	1976260	He's ball.
1976260	1978940	You know, that's, I don't know you.
1978940	1983660	And he points at Dawn and he's like, I don't know who you are, but I don't know who you
1983660	1984660	are either.
1984660	1985660	God damn it.
1985660	1989540	Did you become Silas Cole after one of our days waking up in the mausoleum?
1989540	1996780	Yeah, it was when you were up in the mausoleum and I went down underneath Bean's Pond and
1996780	2003900	then I saw Tildy and I used the gun and I was Silas Cole.
2003900	2006300	Am I going to have to rerecord all of your lines?
2006940	2010260	Yeah, and you're going to have to, you're going to have to pop yourself in the throat
2010260	2012380	a couple of times before you do.
2012380	2016180	Yeah, he's, he's right.
2016180	2017180	I remember now.
2017180	2024140	So then, so then after you were thrown as Silas Cole into a hole, a, a Cole in a hole,
2024140	2026300	then you woke up again in the mausoleum with us?
2026300	2027300	No.
2027300	2028300	No, not you.
2028300	2029300	Our Keith.
2029300	2030300	Sorry.
2030300	2031300	Sorry.
2031300	2032300	Not you.
2032300	2033300	Oh, you want to hear mine though?
2033300	2035500	Don't we, didn't we just figure yours out?
2035500	2037780	Just the past, not the, not the present.
2037780	2042380	Oh, I kind of assumed since you got here, you just been hanging, uh, what's, what's
2042380	2043380	been going on?
2043380	2045380	I just been hanging.
2045380	2046380	Okay.
2046380	2047380	Yeah.
2047380	2048380	Yeah.
2048380	2050020	But all the people I put here did this to me.
2050020	2052180	Once you got here or before you got here?
2052180	2053180	Once I got here.
2053180	2054180	Gotcha.
2054180	2055180	Okay.
2055180	2057380	So there's, there's other people around and Clark starts looking around.
2057380	2059140	What do you mean the people you put here?
2059140	2065340	You remember when we put, when, when we put the people, when we put the people in here
2065340	2066500	to get rid of them?
2066500	2070740	Like the professor and the rancher.
2070740	2071740	That's right.
2071740	2074740	Cause we got the big judge, the big judge was Mary.
2074740	2075740	Yeah.
2075740	2076740	That's right.
2076740	2078340	Mary got a hold of Judge Cortland.
2078340	2079340	Good God, Keith.
2079340	2082860	How many did you kill in the service of contentions founding?
2082860	2091100	I mean, I, I really, when I was him, I had, I would say literally no control over my actions.
2091100	2092100	Yeah.
2092100	2095740	But isn't that just what the Nazi said?
2095740	2096980	I'm not saying you're a Nazi.
2096980	2099140	I'm just saying you're, you're saying like a Nazi.
2099140	2100140	I'm not a Nazi.
2100140	2101140	Yeah.
2101140	2102540	But Silas says things like a Nazi.
2102540	2103540	I'm Silas Cole.
2103540	2104540	No, you said it.
2104540	2105540	And I'm Keith.
2105540	2106540	He's me.
2106540	2107700	And no, but he's him.
2107700	2109460	I'm not him right now.
2109460	2110460	He is me though.
2110460	2111800	I'm him, but he's not me.
2111800	2113280	And I'm him, but I'm not him.
2113280	2118300	I'm going to, we, we, we should draw a big mustache on one of you just in case we ever
2118300	2119300	get you confused.
2119300	2124760	You see the giant brand on one of the foreheads that says fool.
2124760	2127140	No, I think a mustache would be...
2127140	2131020	John still takes out a Sharpie and...
2131020	2132020	And puts it on your Keith.
2132020	2134960	A fancy little, yeah, on our Keith.
2134960	2135960	Okay.
2135960	2138460	There we go.
2138460	2141900	Now we'll just remember Keith has, has the, the fetching.
2141900	2144180	You better not draw a Hitler mustache on me.
2144180	2145820	No, I didn't draw you Hitler mustache.
2145820	2149880	I really like this fella named Jimmy Buffett and he's got a song called Pencil Thin Mustache
2149880	2153660	about all the movie stars that you grew up watching.
2153660	2154660	Yeah.
2154660	2155660	It's on that.
2155660	2158460	It's, it's a couple tracks after that I think on the greatest hits maybe.
2158460	2161660	But yeah, you got a little, a nice little Clark Gable mustache.
2161660	2162660	Well thank you.
2162660	2165540	But maybe we gave it some, some fun little twists up at the end.
2165540	2166540	Yeah, I think we did.
2166540	2167940	Look, there's a happy little twist.
2168420	2171620	You said Mary threw you in the portal.
2171620	2173780	This question goes out to any Keith.
2173780	2176620	How did you, how did, why did Mary turn on you?
2176620	2184820	Well, Mary was his ball, you know, that I made, that he made, that we made, and it got
2184820	2186220	into...
2186220	2187220	He high fives you.
2187220	2188220	I high five him back.
2188220	2189220	How's his hands looking?
2189220	2195780	As soon as he high fives you, he's like, ah, and like kind of shakes him, shakes him out
2195820	2200660	because it would hurt so much if you high five someone with all the blood still like
2200660	2201660	in your hands.
2201660	2209940	I mean, yeah, so the ball that we made, ball, which is Mary, got in a big old guy, giant
2209940	2218980	guy, and he, you know, basically killed, kind of got rid of us.
2218980	2219980	A giant guy?
2219980	2220980	Big old guy.
2220980	2223540	Is that guy up there in the toilet paper tube?
2223540	2225740	No, not that big.
2225740	2227940	Also what do you know about that, I point up?
2227940	2231820	You know, Clark was babbling a little bit about it, but it seemed like he, he had taken
2231820	2232980	leave of his mind there.
2232980	2237180	He seemed to think that there should, should be others, other people, other...
2237180	2241860	Yeah, uh, Fool Keith, uh, you've been here for a while, have you seen other people around
2241860	2242860	here?
2242860	2245940	Have you seen, when I was here a long time ago, there were people who were kind of keeping
2245940	2247540	that thing at bay, and I don't see them here now.
2247540	2250220	Have you seen them go anywhere, do anything, or?
2250220	2254820	They used to, ah, they used to, there used to be people there, yeah.
2254900	2255900	What happened to them, do you know?
2255900	2259500	Nope, they're just not there no more, but that thing's bigger now.
2259500	2264140	You said you got kicked out of there, and I point to the building, you got kicked out
2264140	2265140	of there?
2265140	2266140	Who kicked you out?
2266140	2267140	A long time ago.
2267140	2268140	Who kicked you out?
2268140	2278900	Gambler, named Thomas, uh, the professor, and the rancher, and, uh, bartender, the piano
2278900	2282320	player, they were all super angry that I'd thrown them down here.
2282320	2283900	Why were you throwing them down here again?
2283980	2285980	Again, this goes out to either Keith.
2285980	2287980	They were finding out about the residue.
2287980	2288980	Right, right, right.
2288980	2289980	Residue?
2289980	2290980	I've been calling it a muck.
2290980	2291980	Mmm, I like that.
2291980	2292980	Good name.
2292980	2295980	Wait, were we using the residue to make stuff?
2295980	2299980	When we made stuff, the residue is the magical brite product.
2299980	2300980	Okay.
2300980	2301980	Silas?
2301980	2302980	Nah.
2302980	2304980	John, John's getting real serious here.
2304980	2310980	So you're, you are the, the Keith who became Silas, and, and made ball?
2310980	2311980	Yeah.
2313980	2317980	At long last, this is my, my real daddy.
2317980	2318980	Ahhh!
2318980	2325980	And he reaches out, and he's gonna swipe, uh, some of the, uh, muck from your face,
2325980	2330780	and he puts it on his thumb, and then he swipes it across your forehead, and he says,
2330780	2331780	Simba!
2331780	2334980	Did you just lie, you just lying king to me?
2334980	2340780	Oh my god, I kneel down, I kneel down in front of him, and I start rubbing his head like
2340780	2341780	Keith is.
2341780	2342780	Yes!
2343660	2344660	Thank you, Daddy.
2344660	2346660	Thank you, thank you for accepting me, Daddy.
2346660	2348660	Oh, you're beautiful.
2348660	2350660	Thank you, I try, I hope I'll make you proud.
2350660	2352660	Have you, have you had children?
2352660	2356660	No, I'm a bit of, you know, I'm a bit of a, bit of a hound dog, bit of a bachelor,
2356660	2358660	race car, former race car driver, you know.
2358660	2360660	He, he puts out a fist to pound it.
2360660	2362660	Yeah, I pound it.
2362660	2364660	Can I ask you just one question, Daddy?
2364660	2366660	Of course.
2366660	2368660	Why did you bring me into this world?
2369540	2373540	Well, it's tricky, because I, I already did.
2373540	2375540	So then I did it again, because I already had.
2375540	2380540	Ain't that just why parents keep having babies, you know, when you get right down to it?
2382540	2385540	Just doing what's expected of you, or what you think's expected of you.
2385540	2387540	I get it, I get it.
2387540	2390540	Alright, so it's not like I was planned, but you had to do it, I get it, alright.
2390540	2394540	I have as much of a valid reason for existing as any of these guys did.
2394540	2396540	I think so, yeah.
2397420	2402420	Silas, are you saying you only did things because they, it happened already?
2402420	2404420	And you're just trying to do them?
2404420	2406420	I didn't have to try.
2406420	2410420	I just did what I did, and it happened to be the thing that already happened, because that's what I did.
2410420	2412420	That's deep, that's like Eastern.
2412420	2414420	You're so wise, Daddy.
2416420	2418420	Wow, that is...
2420420	2422420	Daddy, if we get out of here, can we have a catch?
2424420	2425420	Of course.
2426300	2428300	Right on, right on. Thanks, Pops.
2428300	2441300	I hate to break this up as sweet as it is, but I, you know, before I ran right into you, I was trying to get to that building because of that, as I point up.
2441300	2450300	And when you point up, you all look and see this thing, it has been getting a little bit closer, you think, than the last time you saw it.
2451180	2461180	And you remember that this Silas Cole version of Keith did say that since the people around it have gone, that the thing has been getting bigger.
2461180	2475180	And then you look back down at the building in the distance, and you all see, making its way toward you, across this twinkling terrain, is some sort of four-wheeled personal vehicle.
2475180	2478180	Like a double-wide motorcycle.
2479060	2489060	But as soon as it starts to get close enough for you all to recognize the wheelsman of this sort of smart car without the little doors or roof, a portal opens up right above it.
2489060	2500060	A very similar portal to the John Made Hole you all just recently escaped through, and crashing down onto the back of this tricycle with the same amount of wheels in the front as in the back,
2500060	2510060	is a gaunt woman with crazy hair and enormous thick glasses that make her already large eyes look even bigger.
2510060	2519060	She wears jeans and a white t-shirt with a leather jacket, and four wiry metal tendrils protrude from the back of her neck.
2519060	2529060	One dethrones the previous driver of this four-wheeler, tossing him behind like carelessly placed banana peels in Mario Kart.
2529060	2534060	As the other three plant themselves firmly into the fluorescent floor below.
2534060	2550060	Rose Mary, but this time with periods after each letter in Mary, holds on tight to her mechanical steed with 42 horsepower, and her long silver limbs fling her up high into the air,
2550060	2563060	so high in fact that she seems to click into a new set of gravitational rules, and she falls wheels first onto the ground of the bright cylinder that hangs above this place,
2563060	2574060	and houses the lumbering Gigantam Bropithecus, and the consistently one-upping itself ATV drives up and away from you.
2574060	2576060	Holy shit.
2576060	2577060	Damn.
2577060	2579060	Holy shit.
2579060	2581060	So anyway, could we have a catch sometime?
2585060	2594060	So basically this four-wheeler's heading toward you guys. It's in between you and this imposing building off in the distance that's made out of a shiny black substance,
2594060	2605060	and suddenly a portal opens up above the four-wheeler. Rose Mary, M-A-R-Y, comes down and lands on the back of the four-wheeler.
2605060	2613060	One of the four metal tendrils coming out of her neck rips the driver off of the four-wheeler and tosses them behind her,
2613060	2629060	and then the other three tendrils plant themselves into the ground and fling her and the ATV up into the air so fucking high that they go up inside the toilet paper holder,
2629060	2641060	cylinder of light that is hanging above you all, and she lands inside of it and starts driving towards this massive lumbering beast that you've seen.
2641060	2642060	Roll Sanity.
2646060	2647060	Fail.
2647060	2648060	Fail.
2648060	2649060	Fail.
2649060	2657060	This is a zero slash one, so you guys all lose one sanity as you already knew the ball was inside of Rose Mary,
2657060	2665060	because two of you watched Marvin Glass fling the ball at her when it took her over before she fired the gun,
2665060	2672060	and you already knew that these things were capable of, like, insane feats.
2672060	2683060	However, a couple new things. One, just the sheer fact that this thing anime jumped itself with a four-wheeler up that high is fucking crazy,
2683060	2693060	and then for Jon, personally, realizing that you can be in your body and use the metal tendrils is a new idea,
2694060	2701060	which that could be sanity-blasting in and of itself that you could be a Spider-Man villain if you so choose.
2702060	2710060	If you were to look at the back of Jon's neck, you might see some tendrils, like, just bubbling up beneath the surface in anticipation.
2712060	2713060	This is dope.
2713060	2715060	Everybody roll unnatural real quick.
2718060	2719060	Crit pass.
2719060	2721060	I crit pass too. I got a 22.
2721060	2722060	Holy shit.
2722060	2723060	I got a 55.
2723060	2724060	And I got a 9.
2724060	2727060	I bet my roll be the most important one.
2728060	2730060	I bet you fail.
2730060	2732060	Hold on, I lost one of my dice.
2734060	2738060	That happened to me earlier, and I couldn't find it, and now I'm rolling with my second choice dice.
2738060	2741060	Are you fucking kidding me? I got a 71 on a 70.
2742060	2743060	Oh, shit.
2743060	2746060	That other dice was probably a crit success.
2746060	2748060	I don't know why I did that voice.
2752060	2764060	Dice truly do tell a story, and oftentimes they follow the history, lore, and plot of what's happened in the campaign leading up to this point, which is always handy.
2764060	2770060	Yeah, that's because they're controlled by God, who wants us to have a cool game.
2770060	2773060	Oh, good. I'm glad that you've seen the light.
2773060	2778060	If you have a lame role-playing group with bad rolls, it's because God doesn't love you.
2778060	2780060	You just gotta pray harder.
2781060	2784060	Get them rolls right. Get them rolls right, boy.
2787060	2789060	Rolls right with God, rolls right with me.
2789060	2792060	And you guys are standing there.
2792060	2795060	And you guys are standing there.
2798060	2808060	Dawn, you don't see fucking anything, but the other three see a bright flash of light right in front of you.
2808060	2812060	And Thomas, take off your headphones real quick. Justin, same with you.
2812060	2835060	Clark and Keith see the translucent, spindly hand holding an old, strange-looking camera with a green light lit as it takes a picture of the three of you standing on this luminous land with darkness in the sky behind you.
2836060	2858060	And the face of Marvin Glass, the orifice with just red lipstick outlining a hole, is only seen for a glint, just a moment in your mind before the bright flash of this camera snaps you back to your current existence.
2858060	2861060	This thing blipped in for only a moment.
2861060	2862060	Dope. Holy shit.
2862060	2864060	Sick. So sick.
2864060	2866060	Holy shit.
2866060	2870060	I rub my eyes and I'm like, did anyone else see that?
2870060	2873060	Clark is also just kind of blinking real hard.
2873060	2879060	I think I saw it. I saw it was him. Did you see it?
2879060	2881060	I saw him, too.
2881060	2883060	Yeah, what are y'all talking about?
2883060	2885060	You remember seeing that picture, don't you, Clark?
2885060	2888060	Yeah, and so I guess we just saw him take it?
2888060	2889060	I think so.
2889060	2890060	Is that what that was?
2890060	2891060	I'm sorry, what did y'all see?
2891060	2893060	It was Marvin.
2893060	2894060	Taking our picture.
2894060	2895060	Taking whose picture?
2895060	2897060	Ours. Here, standing here now.
2897060	2899060	You've seen a picture of that?
2899060	2901060	I'm pretty sure.
2901060	2905060	Yeah, me and Keith were in his office at one point. I don't know if you remember.
2905060	2907060	A couple days ago.
2907060	2909060	You were underwater at the time, I believe.
2909060	2912060	Yeah, no, I'm not allowed to listen to those episodes.
2912060	2918060	And he had a picture. He'd taken it with the camera with the tubes on it.
2918060	2920060	And he kept asking us why we were in it.
2920060	2922060	And at the time, we sure as shit didn't know.
2922060	2926060	But now we know. I guess it was now.
2926060	2929060	Back then, he took our picture now, right?
2929060	2933060	I still couldn't really answer his question if he asked me right now.
2933060	2934060	Exactly, yeah.
2934060	2936060	At least I know where we were?
2936060	2939060	Well, that's a fun little Easter egg, I guess.
2939060	2943060	Anyway, you think Rosemary's gonna kill that thing?
2943060	2947060	Real fast, the timing is still all-timey weirdness here.
2947060	2953060	Because he showed us that picture, and then Rosemary did her shit in the office, and she fired the gun.
2953060	2956060	And now we see, presumably, that she ended up here.
2956060	2960060	But he'd already taken the picture when we saw all that.
2960060	2968060	But just now, we saw that Rosemary came down through a portal, went tearing off into the glowing light up there on the ATV, and then the picture got taken.
2968060	2970060	So there's something weird still going on with all this.
2970060	2972060	Oh, there's something weird going on here?
2978060	2985060	Literally, the second Keith moves into frame and pokes at the little metal tendrils coming out the back of your neck.
2986060	2988060	I give him an uncle slap.
2988060	2990060	The pet and uncle slap away.
2990060	2992060	Ouchie, ouchie.
2992060	2994060	Don't touch my spine.
2995060	3002060	This all just reiterates that time doesn't move the same here, which could be to our advantage or disadvantage. I don't know what to make of that.
3002060	3005060	All things are happening at once, maybe? I don't know.
3005060	3008060	Well, it could be, but probably not, but maybe.
3008060	3013060	I turn to fool Keith. Fool Keith, how long have you been here? From your perspective?
3013060	3021060	It sounds like it was to hang you from your feet for a year. Would you be able to know that it was a year?
3021060	3023060	Yeah, like if I had a watch or something?
3023060	3025060	You don't really have day and night cycles here, I guess.
3025060	3029060	No, it's always bright from the bottom and dark from the top.
3029060	3032060	How many years would you guess you couldn't guess how many years you've been here?
3032060	3035060	Like a hundred and forty.
3035060	3038060	That's a long time. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that.
3038060	3042060	That means apparently you don't age here either.
3042060	3048060	Or need food or water, I guess. Was somebody feeding you? Was somebody keeping you alive here?
3048060	3051060	No, never got hungry. Never got thirsty.
3051060	3058060	I had thought maybe you had peed and pooped all over yourself hanging upside down, but luckily that probably wasn't an issue.
3058060	3060060	No pee-pee, no poo-poo.
3062060	3066060	I want to look up and see what's happening up above us right now.
3066060	3072060	The all-terrain vehicle is driving toward the Gigantam Rapithecus.
3072060	3076060	Do they either one seem to be making progress towards each other very much?
3076060	3077060	Nope.
3077060	3081060	So, Keith, you said the Circle was keeping that thing up there.
3081060	3083060	No, that was me.
3083060	3084060	Sorry.
3084060	3085060	Was I saying that?
3085060	3089060	No, Daddy. I just got Clark and Keith confused.
3089060	3091060	Something weird's happening here.
3093060	3095060	Yeah, I think you're right. Damn.
3095060	3102060	Why did the Circle want to keep this thing up there, and what do y'all think Mary might want with it?
3102060	3108060	The way it was conveyed to me, there's a chance that that's the only thing the Circle of Knowledge has ever wanted, was to keep that thing here.
3108060	3116060	They seemed to think that it was kind of the Destroyer sort of be-all-end-all. If it got out of here, things would be bad.
3116060	3123060	And I'm a little fuzzy that there's, I think, the Overseer. I think the Overseer is supposed to do battle with that thing maybe.
3123060	3128060	He's like the savior that is going to stop that thing once and for all.
3128060	3130060	Yeah, and you're the Overseer.
3130060	3131060	Should we boost you up there?
3132060	3133060	And we're here.
3133060	3140060	I'm not the Overseer yet though, guys. I don't know anything like old Clark does. Clark old does shit that I can't even dream of doing.
3140060	3142060	Maybe you become it when you defeat this thing.
3142060	3151060	Yeah, and I mean if you are the Overseer, eventually it means you are the Overseer now. It's been inside you the whole time.
3151060	3153060	Like ball was inside John.
3153060	3155060	But not the whole time, was it?
3155060	3156060	The whole time.
3156060	3157060	Yeah, the whole time.
3157060	3159060	Oh, the whole time.
3159060	3160060	Mrs. Doubtfire, you guys like that scene?
3161060	3162060	It's a fun movie.
3162060	3163060	The whole time?
3163060	3164060	Anyway.
3164060	3167060	Or like Harry Potter. Always.
3167060	3173060	I always cry at that scene. You know that movie is about kids' parents dying. That tears me up every time.
3173060	3174060	Or like Sandlot.
3174060	3177060	Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
3177060	3180060	Yeah, that dog. That big funny dog.
3180060	3181060	Yeah.
3181060	3182060	He's scary, but ultimately he's a sweetheart.
3182060	3186060	So Clark, if you were going to fight that thing right now, how would you do it?
3186060	3194060	I mean, Jon, you remember when we were fighting Anne, I did do a little bit of what seemed like magic.
3194060	3198060	I was just repeating what I heard though. I don't know if... I can't like create.
3198060	3199060	I don't think.
3199060	3204060	What if you can though? What if like that circle was just saying the words you say right now?
3204060	3210060	I was hoping that when I found my parents' book that I could use that to figure out more stuff. I just...
3210060	3215060	Just say some bullshit and we'll see if that like giant stumbles or something. I don't know.
3215060	3217060	Too-doo-hock-a-noo. Try that.
3217060	3219060	Try too-doo-hock-a-noo.
3219060	3220060	Don.
3220060	3222060	Maybe it coming out of your mouth gives it power.
3222060	3230060	Clark summons up all his gusto that he can and kind of walks away from the group a little bit,
3230060	3235060	cracks his neck, looks up at the monster up there and with...
3235060	3240060	And as you walk away from the group, you see that the man who was thrown off the back of the four-wheeler
3241060	3245060	as the portal opened up above and a man got thrown off the four-wheeler.
3245060	3248060	He's been walking toward you slowly this entire time.
3248060	3251060	And he's pretty much up on you at this point.
3251060	3256060	And so you can keep talking for sure and give it a go.
3256060	3265060	But just to let you know what you see, which is a slender, muscular man in a black t-shirt.
3265060	3273060	He's got tribal tattoo sleeves on both arms going down to his hands and fingertips.
3273060	3278060	Friend is branded across his forehead.
3278060	3280060	Joe, do not let him distract you.
3280060	3285060	He knows that if we say too-doo-hock-a-noo right now, the game's over. We win.
3287060	3289060	Don't get sidetracked.
3289060	3293060	And he's carrying a huge stick, like a staff.
3293060	3298060	And the staff is made out of, you guessed it, pure darkness.
3298060	3300060	I was going to say wood.
3302060	3305060	Clark nods at him and says, hey, Jermaine.
3305060	3310060	Too-doo-hock-a-noo! Too-doo-hock-a-noo!
3310060	3313060	Was it Jermaine? I was looking up which one it was.
3313060	3314060	It absolutely is Jermaine.
3314060	3315060	Fuck yeah.
3315060	3318060	As you start saying too-doo-hock-a-noo, he's like, oh, hey.
3321060	3325060	Do I roll unnatural for my too-doo-hock-a-noo, or does nothing happen?
3326060	3329060	You know, we're kind of making it up as we go.
3330060	3334060	You certainly roll unnatural for your too-doo-hock-a-noo.
3338060	3343060	This is either narratively great or narratively awful, but it's an 83 on a 63, so I fail.
3344060	3347060	Wasn't failing an unnatural roll going to be bad?
3347060	3348060	Yeah.
3348060	3350060	And it motherfucking is, y'all!
3350060	3355060	This towering, lumbering beast plotting for it on two legs seems to...
3360060	3367060	As it realizes that it has been unleashed from the treadmill spell that had been previously put on it,
3367060	3374060	and it begins, boom, boom, boom, moving faster and faster and closer and closer toward you.
3374060	3380060	And as it reaches, the ATV is going straight towards it, and the two are about to collide.
3380060	3382060	Clark is yelling back to the guest, bad idea, bad idea, bad idea!
3382060	3385060	And he's going to start trying to get toward the building.
3385060	3387060	Just say it louder.
3387060	3397060	Rosemary leaps from the back of this all-terrain vehicle and wraps her tendrils around the beast,
3397060	3403060	creating a sort of saddle on this thing as she rides on the back of his neck
3403060	3412060	as this gigantic umbropithecus with Rose M-A-R-Y on the back of it leaps from the edge of the cylinder
3412060	3418060	and lands on the same plane as the five of you.
3418060	3419060	Oh, fuck.
3419060	3423060	Jon goes from six to midnight and considers betraying humanity for the first time.
3426060	3427060	Hell yes.
3429060	3430060	Fuck me.
3442060	3448060	I'm on the borderline, leaving my mind at your altar.
3448060	3452060	Crossing the double line, doing it every time.
3452060	3458060	Tell me what kind of world are you living in?
3461060	3467060	What kind of world are you living in?
3472060	3492060	What kind of world are you living in?
3492060	3501060	What kind of world are you living in?
3501060	3503060	What kind of world are you living in?
