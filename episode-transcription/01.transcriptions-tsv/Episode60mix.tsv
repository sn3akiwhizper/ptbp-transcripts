0	8320	what's up my babies it's your stepdad's stepson wolf wolf the dog's dog taking over the airwaves
8320	18480	here on 694.2 PTBP due to a frankly terrifying display of holiday cheer aka wolf the dog
18480	25600	gargled down more steaming mollusks swapped than the rest of family combined in our semi-annual
25600	35840	chowder challenge oh wolf is in the dumpster and he's breathing but it's real high-pitched
35840	45200	now it is something to do called howling with wolf so how does the man who drives the snow plow get
45200	57360	to work in the morning next is a non-sequitur transition into fucking Mark Zuckerberg but for
57360	63120	real help my fake dad out talk about app pretending part on the internet and give them money on
63120	70160	patreon sometimes people write five star reviews on the apple podcast app and he gets so happy
70160	76080	because he feels validated and understood and that means a lot to dogs like wolf
76960	83680	now put down the booze and listen for clues it's time for the news last time
83680	90480	Leon told Clark that he would become the overseer go back in time and start the circle of knowledge
91040	97200	Leon split the party tried to shoot Clark with a dart gun got fucked by Joel's uncanny ability
97200	103440	to quit and then Leon Clark came to an understanding fulfilling their original plan
103440	109040	the two headed over to the administration building where they heard numbers coming from a voice
109040	117840	at the end of a dark hallway Keith and John went to Harriet Mox's dorm John last touched again and
117840	124240	focused on the Bruce Robin numbers while Keith scoured Harriet's room for clues turns out
124240	131120	Harriet's roommate Amelia thinks the suicide story is fishy and Harriet was on search for two
131120	142400	things the most corrupt corporation in the city and the overseer and now to the middle of a party
142400	151120	timed holiday themed storyline even when Clark is being a dick it's a track that makes my
151120	159200	ball drop welcome to 2020 motherfuckers it's kazoo with no back
159200	171280	boom

194800	199200	you find Cthulhu ah dang it i'll go the other way okay yeah that makes sense
202000	209040	so as you're walking down toward the office you see these two figures in the distance and as you
209680	218320	come up on them you see that one is very short and very slight in stature and also slender
218320	225840	and the small one is uh jumping up and poking at the other figure who is played by Justin

503600	510240	me did you know him before just i have no idea who this person was well all right but i thank you
510240	514240	from the bottom of my heart for striking him multiple times you're not thinking of
514240	519200	numbers right now are you what are you talking about okay just just checking you're not thinking
519200	524400	of numbers at all and you guys look down and you see like leon had flipped on the lights in the
524400	530640	office when the lights come on you see that the walls of the hallway and the office are just
530640	537120	covered in numbers oh shit the entire inner workings of this building have just been like
537120	544560	chalk sharpie pen blood semen everything just like yeah semen and then everything
546400	551280	have been used to write numbers all over these walls and the floor and the ceiling
551280	556560	i uh look a little scared at the well-dressed guy you didn't write any of these did you i
556560	560320	didn't even know these were here until that guy flipped the lights on what are you doing here son
560320	565680	what's your name what are you doing here my name is donovan west haven oh hey donovan i'm leon nice
565680	570960	to meet you what are you doing here oh i'm trying to uh i'm trying to solve this riddle you can see
570960	579840	it up on this uh banner up here why it's the christmas i don't remember it's the christmas
579840	586000	i don't remember huh and then he like literally looks to the bottom right of the banner and there
586000	596720	is a logo for the jingle ball hosted by csu the jingle ball it's a holiday episode at pretending
596720	603680	to be people where the tinkling music comes in justin it's whatever i'll figure whatever our
603680	609360	normal logo is now has christmas lights hanging off of each letter oh that's adorable and all
609440	616320	the scary music is now um it all has like nice little bells and yes honestly just only sleigh
616320	620960	bells that's the only difference just got this constant jingling in the background which might
620960	629520	be more horrifying we're trading out carpenter for williams the jingling never stops clark looks up
629520	636480	at that banner that's just uh that's just the number plus them all so if it's the 10th day
636480	641600	it's 10 gifts and the day before that they would have gotten nine just add them all up i think it's
642640	648640	carry the one is 55 i think i think it's 55 i don't know yeah you have to do what now you're
648640	653920	the first day your lover gave you a partridge in a pear tree sure second day gave you two something
653920	658640	two french hens two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree what is this from oh does she give
658640	664480	you the all the gifts again and then on the third day it's three something or others and then two
664480	668480	turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree right am i singing the song right you're singing the
668480	673360	song right i just figured that each day she was given the extra new gift she wasn't repeating the
673360	679440	previous day's gifts every time if that's the case the math's a lot higher i mean i it could be higher
679440	686320	i i don't know i'm i'm more should we go in the office yeah i just i think that's the answer to
686320	694480	the question on the banner yeah let's go in the office i turned to the well-dressed guy uh you
694480	698320	have a you have a pleasant pleasant day sir can you tell me what that number was again i've
698320	704000	forgotten already i think it's 55 but if leon's right this is leon by the way hi leon hey donovan
704000	708400	hi if leon's correct the number would be a lot higher and i don't have the time to do the math
708400	712480	right now on it which seems like an outrageous number of presence and i thought the first number
712480	717760	was an outrageous number that lady loves that guy clark you're not doing christmas right
719200	725600	and he walks into the office uh with the lights on you see that the everything in this office is
725600	731280	covered in numbers uh the desks the chairs like anything that people could possibly write on
731280	738240	are covered in these numbers and he walks over to a computer weirdly enough there's just one main
738880	748480	computer in this office space and there is a monitor and keyboard normal computer stuff
749360	753840	leon looks at it and is like all right well i guess let's boot it up and there's a passcode
753840	762480	to get in any ideas leon i mean and he starts rifling through the desk looking around the area
762480	769920	you see that there are pictures sitting at this desk of a woman she seems to be in her early
769920	776240	20s same as donovan what was that last name donovan west haven all right similar age of
776240	785520	donovan west haven and you see that the pictures are with trophies from scavenger hunt championships
785520	791360	with this person holding trophies up and you see the name engraved on the trophies
791360	802560	is amelia lock l o c k e with an e and then there's also a group photo of a lot of girls
802560	813840	who seem to be 18 19 years old as well as this nice and uh the frame on this picture says best
813840	822720	r a ever and they're all holding up a sign that says third floor gifts house which is g i f f s
823360	828640	space house let me let me try something here leon and i'm gonna try lock l o c k e as a password
828640	833520	it does not work i'm gonna try amelia it does not work i'm gonna try amelia lock
833520	838800	it does not work okay well we've exhausted all of our options yep we're done here
838800	843440	so
843440	850480	clark i think what we we might need to just find this amelia lock and then convince her to
850480	855200	unlock this computer no no no we're gonna we're just gonna sit here and guess until we get it
855200	860560	okay sounds good what's your next guess uh zero zero zero one okay that one didn't work zero zero
860560	866640	zero two i tried that one as well zero zero zero three okay i think we're on to something you're
866640	872240	locked out for the next uh hour ah shit should have should have thought of that oh we didn't
872240	877120	even try password oh we definitely should have tried password it was password
880400	886640	it was either password or guest admin you really fucked up admin one two three

900240	906080	outside with donovan in the hallway from the vantage of inside the office you see that there's
906080	914560	actually some stuff printed on the back of the banner is a map of campus and the four dorm
915440	923600	have their names listed and the dorms are called maymay house tinder's house redight house and

1035120	1038800	clark i'm sorry i'm sorry i just got excited that you needed help and i'm here to help you and we're
1038800	1043760	gonna we're gonna solve this uh scavenger hunt then okay calm down clark you just see important
1043760	1048960	leon's eyes are big and he looks at you and he's like look at you saving people sometimes it feels
1048960	1055200	like it's what i was meant to do all right well let's go to either 55 or 330 gifts house yeah i
1055200	1059440	mean i think mine's correct but if you think that she's giving all those presents every day let's go
1059440	1071840	to yours so when you guys walking across campus it is again a ghost campus there's nobody out
1071840	1082720	and about you hear some like
1083840	1088240	just like for you know just like normal noises from across campus just like some creepy noises
1088240	1092880	not to dissuade your foley work because that was wonderful thank you but was it all obviously
1092880	1097360	emitted by a human or is there some of those that are actual animal noises at least one of those was
1097920	1105840	an owl okay it wasn't the one that sounded like an owl that was a person and you guys make it over
1105840	1113040	to gifts house unobstructed and when you get in there you see there's a little secretary desk on
1113040	1119600	the right and the sitting area on the left with a baby grand piano and then ahead of you there is a
1119600	1125040	glass wall with a door there and all the lights are out by the way nobody's sitting at that
1125520	1132720	nobody is sitting at the receptionist desk the uh the lonely glow of the computer there is shining
1132720	1138480	onto an empty chair behind it clark is just going to point at the computer and i'm motioning for
1138480	1144800	leon hey leon you want to check on that and clark is going to go like to is there a staircase in
1144800	1150720	here so when you walk forward past the desk you would see there's hallways on either side of you
1151440	1157600	and there are doors with like the little stairwell markings on both sides right or left well i just
1157600	1164640	kind of clark just wants to yell down if there's nobody around hello anybody anybody here roll an
1164640	1170720	alertness for me justin you want to roll some dice yeah roll an alertness for me i bet you
1170720	1177760	have like a 60 in an alertness uh yeah i rolled two d-10s they aren't he doesn't even know which
1177760	1182960	dice to roll hey joe hey joe shut your fucking mouth
1185120	1189840	it's so dark in here i failed failed oh wait wait wait is a double a uh crit fail
1194400	1200640	that's beautiful i i failed also not a crit though perfect well uh as you're just like
1200640	1208400	stumbling around in the darkness donovan walks over into a hallway that is an offshoot from the
1208400	1214160	bigger hallway that leads to the stairwell and the light comes on you see that the walls on either
1214160	1222880	side of you are just covered in these numbers and like there's some sigils posted up now and
1222880	1230080	it's just some sigils sigils yeah and it's all written in the same just like varying materials
1230640	1235680	as soon as the lights come on you just hear from a door in this hallway there are three
1235680	1244160	doors in this hallway and from inside one of them you hear no no no five six four five five five
1244160	1252080	six no no the door cracks open and you just hear please turn out the lights
1252080	1259200	oh my god donovan slowly shuts the lights backs away
1260480	1268720	thank you and the door shuts real quick there's silence you're you're welcome hey donovan come
1268720	1273600	back this way this let's stay away from that uh that area there real fast i think that's a good
1273600	1278240	idea donovan i i know you didn't ask for this but there's a chance that we're wrapped up in
1278240	1283760	something real bad here and those numbers might be infectious so if you hear numbers you might
1283760	1288080	close your ears or maybe don't look at them i'm not sure how it works hey leon you know how this
1288080	1293200	thing transfers he doesn't respond and when you look over at him he's actually wearing his noise
1293200	1300640	canceling headphones ah fuck i tap him on the shoulder oh he startled looks over at you and
1300640	1307840	he points at the computer screen and he's pulled up the room number for amelia lock amelia lock
1308240	1317360	she lives in 328 gifts house and her roommate is harriet marks ah it's all coming together
1317360	1323360	you notice when you turn back around the glass panel of windows looking into a separate room
1323920	1329440	uh the glint of the uh computer screen kind of shines over there enough for you to make out a
1329440	1334640	pool table in that room you assume it's some sort of entertainment or games room there's probably
1334640	1341440	nothing fucked up in there hey leon leon he takes the headphones off and he's like yeah i'm
1341440	1346000	just trying to you know protection from the numbers right yeah you got a couple extra pairs
1346000	1350240	of those well you seem already fucked and this one's a dumb dumb so should be fine you think
1350240	1354480	i'm already fucked well that's why we're here right to fix what happened to you i mean i feel
1354480	1358800	like we snapped out of it didn't we we're not we're i'm not saying numbers now am i you're not
1358800	1362960	right now we'll see about that i don't know maybe i've been inoculated maybe that's what happened
1362960	1366400	here maybe maybe since i've already done the numbers thing and you snapped me out of it you
1366400	1370720	snapped all of us out of it maybe i don't have numbers in me anymore i hope that that's true

1556400	1564480	years releasing for a year and we've made it all the way from december 1st to december 6th what a
1564480	1571840	week and way back in the past and then way back in the future past yeah i bet we'll make it by the
1571840	1577280	end of tonight all the way to christmas to christmas all the way to christmas spoilers hey i have to
1577280	1583840	tell you the bad news okay john lee pettimore is gaining a new mania and it is going to completely
1583840	1589680	engross him oh he didn't reach his breaking point i know he didn't but it's a part of a mechanic for
1589680	1597680	this arc that this mania will absolutely dominate every other mania that you've had before and every
1597680	1602560	role-playing decision that you make so it's going to be kind of important and i hope you roll well
1602560	1608560	so you're going to roll three d 100s and we'll look at the list and see what you got
1609360	1615520	94 okay keep rolling 89 oh that's a good one i bet sounds like it yeah it's high
1615520	1624560	99 whoa jesus all right so 94 is theomania belief that he or she is a god
1628560	1633760	i think maybe we've got a winner right off the bat yeah if you can get me back in a room with joe
1633760	1640000	oh we've got another really good one 89 is scribbleomania an obsession with scribbling
1640080	1647520	or doodling interesting that's really really appropriate and then 99 is xenomania which is
1647520	1654720	an obsession with foreign things i'm gonna choose theo philia or thea what was it theomania you
1654720	1660240	love god i love god what was it theomania theomania belief that he or she is a god
1660240	1666720	there's two gods in this role-playing game now and that's not counting any of the elders uh
1666800	1670880	something older than me older than john lee pettymore himself
1672480	1679280	as far as we know i'm ageless i came out of a spine as a little ball i can do anything i am
1679280	1685680	planet juggernaut and i am your god hell yeah it's important in delta green to really give people a
1685680	1692640	sense of hero worship over their own character yeah let's get into it
1706160	1713200	so i know we're past christmas but we still have a lot of holiday traditions that take place around
1713200	1720000	the end of december and the beginning of january or mostly the in between therefore of the two
1720000	1725680	situations with which we call calendar months within a year into the next one but i was
1725680	1732800	wondering what your guys's favorite family traditions are from the holiday season no i
1732800	1736320	don't want to tell you you're gonna make it something scary i'm gonna make it something
1736400	1740000	so scary yeah i don't trust like that
1741920	1748400	justin i've always said that you should trust more yeah i just don't though and that hurts
1750160	1757920	how can zack manipulate you it's really fucking hard to gaslight you when you don't trust the
1757920	1765520	words i say justin i'm sorry zack when i was a kid we used to listen to a song uh when we were
1765520	1770800	hanging out the ornaments on the tree we'd always listen to christmas music and one of
1770800	1776320	our favorites was a muppet christmas carol soundtrack to that movie it was great but
1776320	1783120	my personal favorite growing up was a song by john denver this isn't a joke this is just true
1783120	1791520	it he has a song called merry christmas little zachary oh that's you and it made my heart warm
1791520	1794880	did you know he died yes yeah he's dead we made it scary for you
1796960	1802720	and now every time i hear it i can only so when i when i heard the song as a child i could always
1802720	1810960	immediately visualize john denver's face wherever he was in the world but now i just see his rotting
1810960	1821520	corpse which is cool and festive but it's not you know what i'm looking for so i had to stop
1821520	1827520	listening to that song you just think of this instead luke is just handed oh my god dude stop
1827520	1834720	it it's a it's a picture of john denver's plane crash that's not his it's just a plane crash
1835040	1841600	it's wildly inappropriate merry christmas everybody
1844400	1849760	other than the normal like christmas morning stuff that i absolutely love we have a weird
1849760	1857600	tradition in the family that christmas eve we do a frozen pizza and oyster soup that is interesting
1857600	1863040	very weird so the frozen pizzas i think comes from my mom and they've just chalked it up as
1863120	1867200	like not wanting to cook the night before christmas okay and then i think my dad maybe
1867200	1871440	brought the oysters no that might have been hers also but the oyster soup is like a really great
1871440	1875920	fancy oyster soup that my dad makes and it's great great great and it's really weird to have them
1875920	1880640	together and i love it yeah it doesn't sound good it's weird and it's i don't know if i could
1880640	1886880	recommend it but i it's a christmas memory yeah what do you guys do while you're having this like
1886880	1892640	weird dichotomous meal it's with family friends instead of family it's the it i i i do sunday
1892640	1896320	suppers with a bunch of people that i've done since i was a voice changer when you said that
1896320	1900880	because it's so wholesome and sweet he's a little he's a little child and it's that group i get
1900880	1905520	together with that group for that christmas eve that's fun yeah i like that justin what's your
1905520	1911360	family do on uh my family is weird because we don't do jack shit on christmas we do everything
1911360	1917600	on christmas eve and we do an all like homemade italian meal oh hell yeah this is my grandparents
1917600	1922960	who immigrated from argentina in argentina it's like a ton of italian food so they just uh
1922960	1925920	we just wonder why that is because there's a lot of italian stuff
1929680	1935680	luke do you need anything for christmas uh we uh christmas lunch and it's like a bunch of
1936400	1942400	appetizers like little smokies and meatballs oh nice yeah and also
1946160	1952800	so uh my family for christmas um my stepmom will always make uh fresh cinnamon rolls
1952800	1954880	oh and then we drink mimosas
1958160	1961440	yeah it's justin hasn't been on mike in a while
1961440	1964960	you know you learned to not sneeze
1967040	1970960	oh god have you seen that video of trump getting pissed off with the guy who sneezes anyway we
1970960	1975600	don't need to talk about monsters on this show it's it's christmas it's time to think about
1975600	1982240	pleasant things not real horror yeah um and then uh my step sister who like uh is a chef she went
1982240	1988080	to culinary school and everything oh credentials she makes us these dope eggs benedict damn hell
1988560	1992320	yeah it's a lot of fun that's awesome we get sloshed and we eat cinnamon rolls and eggs benedict

2021200	2025520	numbers you would see like oh that that might actually be the one that we're looking for the
2025520	2033200	328 number and when you arrive there you find keith vigna and john lee pettymore standing in

2066000	2070160	there's a dead body in the elevator and he saw it and he started uh he just kind of
2070720	2076960	blanked out and started writing uh bruce robbins the the code for bruce robbins numbers again
2076960	2081840	yeah maybe that's what it seemed like i dragged him along with me corporeal form dead but yeah
2081840	2086720	well john were you writing were you writing numbers did you ever feel did you ever feel

2105680	2110400	welcome to the to the room everyone you guys i think i brought you all here you guys would
2110400	2116560	notice that they are with a third person so keith vigna and john lee pennymore you are seeing
2116880	2123600	donovan for the first time and he looks like what justin's about to say donovan west haven is about
2123600	2129440	six foot one six foot two somewhere in between those two inches dark nice hair done up really
2129440	2133440	nice and he has like a let's see he's like a button-up buttoned all the way up tucked in
2133440	2138720	he's a handsome boy who are you an adult boy just to be make sure we all know that he's an adult
2138720	2143920	who's this clark guys this is this is donovan donovan this is the fellas that's john over there
2143920	2148320	and that's uh keith there i shake your hand i'm like donovan i've known you all your life
2148320	2153600	donovan doesn't shake he nods at you and's like hi what's up we ran into this guy like nod and smile
2153600	2158480	over in the uh the administration building me and leon think there's a chance he's immune to these
2158480	2162880	numbers he's been here on campus in the middle of what you're saying john lee pettymore walks
2162880	2171760	straight into a wall like slams into it yeah john john no i'm still working up the kinks don't worry
2171760	2178240	i've got it all in my hands oh god okay keith what were you saying though sorry has he been
2178240	2184640	like this for a while i mean he was no longer than you know he was normal until we saw that body then
2184640	2189760	he started writing on the walls and now i don't know what the fuck he's doing do you do you keith
2189760	2195120	have any missing time in your no okay who's this guy his name's donovan we ran into him we think
2195120	2199520	that he might be immune to the the infection of the numbers he said he's been having people
2199520	2205760	yelling at him numbers all for the last few days a few days yeah and he seems to have no ill effects
2205760	2210960	he doesn't he doesn't affect other people i mean it affected us have any other do you know any
2210960	2220080	other students it's been affecting oh like um all of them except me okay we actually ran into him he
2220080	2224640	had another fellow with him who was asking to be punched in the face and then he started saying
2224640	2233680	numbers so i obliged well we found a we found a body in the elevator uh dead um i didn't
2233680	2240880	investigate too much on it but uh nearly moved on to the next phase i kind of look at john and
2241520	2247520	eyebrows high john smiles benevolently at you i didn't investigate it too much but uh it could
2247520	2252800	have been self-inflicted i'm not really sure were there were there numbers on or around the body
2252800	2258080	i mean there's numbers all in this you look around the room and the room itself is also
2258080	2263040	covered in these numbers as was the hallway on the way down the floor the ceiling all over the desk
2263040	2268320	the chair all over the place in here from what i'm gathering from leon here he's not even 100 sure
2268320	2273520	the uh method of infection but he puts on headphones every now and then just to maybe
2273520	2280240	combat the that's not not a bad idea so the only thing i've found obviously you know we're in
2280240	2286240	harriet's room uh we found out her her roommate's name is amelia amelia lock amelia lock yeah
2287680	2292320	have you seen this and i hold up the flyer for the ball yeah do you uh do you know about the
2292320	2297200	scavenger hunt yeah but i haven't really found anything out about it but uh if you look over
2297200	2302000	there and i point to amelia's desk take a look at those trophies i do you would see that they
2302000	2310160	are trophies for being an elite riddle master and a scavenger hunt champion oh yeah so we we found
2310640	2316640	i found her desk at the administration's office oh yeah and uh i saw some pictures of her holding
2316640	2322800	these trophies here um there was also a clue back at those offices i assume maybe the first
2322800	2330560	clue what was it it uh basically asked how many presents does a person get on the 10th day of
2330560	2337360	christmas and me and leon have differing opinions on that number but either way it's just a number
2337360	2343520	i don't know if it well well i would say 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 and 1 thank you thank you keith
2343520	2349920	thank you john exactly leon uh i'm just saying i just can take my answer on this is fairly
2349920	2356160	authoritative i don't understand are you really good at math amongst other things you there what
2356160	2366640	was his name donovan what was his last name west haven west fucker west mr wet fucker why do you
2366640	2375040	think mr wet fucker you there child your voice got weird mr char mr west fucker are you do you
2375040	2379120	hear yeah what's up why do you think the numbers had no effect on you i couldn't tell you honestly
2379120	2385840	i don't know tell me i'm just maybe you know it just like i know it tell me maybe i'm maybe i'm
2385840	2391360	special after all ah yes i can see it in you
2394000	2400240	you are special you are very special more than you know child is john speaking with an accent
2400240	2406080	have you noticed i don't know i mean he wasn't acting like this before your friends are weird
2406080	2411760	and they're freaking me out so leon here thinks that every day she's repeating the
2411760	2418480	presents from the previous day i don't no i don't think that i think it'd be 110 the only the only
2418480	2423120	leg he has to stand on is that she does say on the fifth day christmas my true love
2426400	2433120	hey out of character think about who made this puzzle and then and then who do you think has the
2433120	2437440	right but i also i agree with that you get all the presents each day right you get all the presents
2437440	2442240	the true love is a real true love well if that's the case then look at this
2442240	2449280	also 330 is the room right next to us it's the room right across the hall and keith vigno holds
2449280	2456640	up a sheet and on the back of the sheet is all the math of like one plus three plus you know
2456640	2464560	essentially uh fibonacci sequence but not right for this thing and it leads to 330 which is the
2464560	2469280	room across the hall which keith vigno would then say i found this in there
2474560	2481040	and i hold up another piece of paper you guys fucking nailed it we got there i hold up a piece
2481040	2489920	of paper that has a picture like in cartoon form a picture of seven eggs a golf ball a cat a demon
2490640	2496320	and another egg yep uh yeah there was nothing in there beside it was just a normal it's like
2496320	2501280	we found out it's a like a staging dorm room that nobody lives in it's just to show prospective
2501280	2506880	students what a dorm room looks like i found this in there and there's a casio keyboard in there
2506880	2511520	too does that mean anything to you casio keyboard it doesn't mean anything no no it doesn't mean
2511520	2516480	anything to me either but i can tell you whoever made this riddle seems very cool
2516480	2523440	you a puzzle fan leon oh huge puzzle fan i'm glad you're here with us then do these look
2523440	2531440	like emojis from the movie yeah exactly are these emojis from the emoji movie i don't know if there
2531440	2538000	are yeah essentially they're this of similar ilk in style but they're not emojis i don't think so
2540400	2546080	right no i'm not there i just mean like they're not like it's not made out of emojis they're
2546080	2551360	like cartoons they're like cartoons they're uh illustrations cool like pictogram they could be
2551360	2558240	small enough to be sent in text form though does that make it an emoji no man oh okay then no
2558240	2566880	definitively no it was seven eggs a golf ball a cat i saw seven eggs a demon and an egg when you
2566880	2571040	say demon can you describe that demon is it like the demon emoji yeah it looks like the demon
2571440	2579600	like is it horns is that what it has yep okay purple with horns baby and a little toothy smile
2581360	2587040	that one's an emoji uh just a couple other things before i don't know if i mean we ought
2587040	2591760	to probably go check that room out but uh in harriet's desk she has a to-do list
2592400	2597440	number one research the most unethical corporation in the city and number two
2597440	2606800	just said who is the overseer and then uh in in uh i know amelia's desk uh she had a little note
2606800	2612160	i found and basically says she didn't think that harriet would have committed suicide and that
2612160	2617200	she's going to try to get to the bottom of it and that's what i found in here so far so previously
2617200	2622640	we were thinking that maybe it was a uh a leaping disease that went from one person to the next and
2622720	2629040	he wrote down their names and yada yada if harriet killed herself first then amelia
2629040	2633360	would have maybe gotten it or gotten it in investigating her death that could be have
2633360	2637200	we seen amelia's name written anywhere in these numbers and i do a quick look around
2637200	2641840	at the actual numbers and see if i can find her name in the numbers nice roll search
2641840	2653760	i pass an eight 20 you find a couple numbers that start with one but none of them move to
2653760	2658640	whatever m is next what about her last name just lock can't find it anywhere okay yeah i'm just
2658640	2662960	not sure if our if our theory is wrong or something else happened in the sequence of
2662960	2667760	events here but donovan what do you think i gotta get that jingle ball i need it you
2667760	2673920	mean you have to get to the jingle ball yeah whatever i just want to win whatever donovan
2673920	2678320	do they give out an actual jingle ball at the jingle ball if you make it there last maybe
2678880	2687840	that was really rude of you yeah sick burn leon yeah what what the hell he's not children children
2687840	2694880	i look at both of you like with a right smile but like paternal love i am unsettled as long
2694880	2700400	as you're quiet young man holy shit and quiet he is
2702480	2709280	jesus you see john lee pettymore is beaming at you with fraternal pride do you think we ought
2709280	2713600	to go back into 330 see if you guys might find something i didn't so yeah i'd like to so
2713600	2718480	beautiful put my eyes on that room for sure i'll head across the hall so when you guys go across
2718480	2728320	the hall into 330 you would find this dorm room set up to be the pinnacle of what all dorm rooms
2728320	2736640	could look like here at csu come on down become one of the fighting plant things can't remember
2736640	2742080	it what's it called fly trap and well what if it was the fighting for cithias
2742960	2751520	oh i like that a lot feed me see more and there's a lot of things that we can offer you here at csu
2751520	2758480	much like this dorm room that is very well equipped with lots of blankets and pillows and
2758480	2766320	athleisure which is what the college kids wearing these days bad commercial for csu but uh you would
2766400	2772400	see that all over this room there are numbers thickly written i mean to the point where it's
2772400	2778640	hard to make out the sequences just like everywhere else however in the middle of this room there is
2778640	2784400	just a casio keyboard sitting there it's turned on and there's a music stand that is now empty
2784400	2787920	i'd like to play the keyboard cat riff oh you do it can you do it
2787920	2800320	it just kind of goes on right john does it though does the pictogram symbols do they end
2800320	2806800	with a single egg yes i picked this up off that music stand and the symbols are on a staff on a
2806800	2814720	music staff yes oh is it in the form of e g c d e it's written just across the music staff it's
2814960	2821040	no up or down okay but we might assume one might assume a guess might be it's the guess that was
2821040	2825440	clearly being made there i want to hit those notes that are the first letters of the words
2825440	2843520	of the pictures e justin can you take that live for us wow she is majestic wait does that keyboard
2843760	2848880	that keyboard does not have an outboard audio on it but we could pause and go to the piano
2848880	2852640	real quick i'd like to hear it let's take a pause and go to the upright piano real quick
2854560	2862400	joe hammered down those notes that he got and keep in mind my dad is a professional piano player
2863040	2869680	so it only took us about 45 minutes to practice one it's four in the morning we're all dying but
2869680	2878560	assuming the first letter of egg golf ball cat demon and egg represents musical notes it might
2878560	2894800	sound a little bit something like this and as g vigna or clark bishop are all of you with your
2894800	2904400	hands all together just doing it like the cat did on the keyboard as you play the jingle bells tune
2904400	2909040	you all the camera like pans through you none of us thought to not do this
2911440	2919040	and no it's nice you look through the window and you see right out the window of 330
