0	2680	Welcome, babies one and all.
2680	5360	Welcome, rabies one and all.
5360	8080	Get them shots before you foam at the mouth.
8080	16320	It's Wolf the Dog, here to administer your rabies medication live from 694.2 PTBB.
16320	22160	I don't accept insurance, but I'll gladly accept your soul as payment.
22160	29280	We wanted to give a few special shout-outs before we dip into this very special Plot Talk episode.
29440	31520	Spoilers abound, y'all.
31520	33520	First, check out our Reddit.
33520	35600	It's filled with a fun community.
35600	40640	You can find that at reddit.com r slash pretending to be people.
40640	43920	You can find a link to the Discord in there somewhere.
43920	46960	Come chat with us and hang out a little bit.
46960	52960	Also, go on over to twitch.tv slash pretending pod streams.
52960	58400	I've heard some dummy named Justin has been trying to stream more often lately.
58400	63520	And some of those other pretending to be people boys sometimes join in on the fun.
63520	66240	I wish I knew what streaming was.
66240	69440	Sounds like it involves a lot of liquid.
69440	72640	And you know I'm always all about that.
73280	76160	But that all is besides the point.
76160	80960	The point is that this episode is about discussing the finer points.
80960	82320	What is the point?
82320	83920	Where are we even?
83920	86000	Where do we go when we sleep?
86000	88000	Am I human after all?
89440	90400	Probably not.
91040	94560	But anyway, it seems these pretending to be people boys
94560	99840	finally figured out how to record from a distance at the scientist's insistence.
99840	107040	So with no more resistance, I howl out for assistance from the tune that fuels this wolf's existence.
107040	113600	It's kudzu with no back bone.
116000	145760	5, 6, 7, clap.
146400	150240	My last clap hit my fingertips a little, but it should be still loud enough.
150240	153040	That second one sounded like we did it in such unison
153040	155920	that I actually didn't think anyone else did it except me.
155920	157040	I think it was perfect, yeah.
158240	161760	Even the video aligned beautifully.
161760	166560	But also when I'm editing these, it makes me sound like the Dumbo.
166560	171760	Because if you're all set to this clap one, then you're all together.
171760	173680	And I'm slightly off from you.
173680	175200	So you say something and then I'm like...
177680	178720	Good one, Thomas.
179680	182160	Just like a little bit too late.
182960	187040	Anywho, I'll just match it up with the Zoom call and it'll all be good.
187040	187680	Hell yeah.
188480	189600	Getting it figured out.
190160	191600	Let me know when to go, daddy.
193680	196480	Oh, son, it is game time.
196480	203440	Hello everyone and welcome to the pretending to be people plot talk Q&A episode.
203920	207280	How's everyone doing on this beautiful spring day?
207280	208240	Real good.
208240	208800	Good.
208800	209520	Doing good.
209520	212720	I'm living large and I'm in charge.
213440	217600	Now, Zach, I'm going to need you to talk less because I am in charge of the podcast now.
218400	220640	You gave me the power and it will never come back.
223360	225440	Y'all just want to hop into some of these questions.
225440	227600	We got a whole lot of them to get through today.
228880	229760	Yeah, let's do it.
229760	231360	No, that's okay if we don't want to.
233680	236160	So first question.
236160	239760	Oh, do you want, do we, should we do a description of what we're about to do today?
239760	242960	Well, Luke and I are too busy changing our Zoom backgrounds.
242960	243460	Yeah.
246320	247040	Oh man.
247040	248000	Read this.
248000	251920	Luke's is reminding me of playing enter the matrix and it really
252640	254320	makes me want to bust out my PS2.
254320	256080	Read this stuff right above my head.
257680	258400	No.
258400	260480	I, a hacker, enter my world.
264000	265680	You call us criminals.
265680	267200	This is my manifesto.
268240	269120	Oh no.
269120	270000	This is creepy.
270000	271680	Is it actually a manifesto?
271680	273680	This says I didn't show it.
273680	274320	Show my work.
274320	279840	Did you just Google image search manifesto and then set it as your background matrix?
282560	284960	I like the thing that says damn kids.
284960	286240	They're all alike.
286240	289040	And then I can see hacker question mark.
292000	292880	Tasteless.
293440	296960	Thomas has a very, very cute Murphy behind him.
296960	298080	Oh, I love him.
298080	299360	We love Murphy.
299360	301600	I shouldn't say I love, we all love Murphy.
301600	303680	Which one should I set it to for the rest though?
303680	304720	I got quite a few.
304720	305680	What's your favorite?
305680	308800	Oh, I couldn't possibly choose that one.
308800	309840	Yeah, that one's a good one.
309840	310720	Yeah, I lied.
310720	311600	That one's the best.
311600	312800	This one's pretty good.
312800	313840	We all chose Ainsley.
314800	315840	Please get Ainsley.
315840	317120	Eats the Hills.
318000	318320	There we go.
318320	318800	Thank you.
318800	319360	There it is.
319360	320240	Not a baby eats a boy.
321040	324080	How do we have like what, three or four questions to do?
325040	328320	Yeah, just, just one or two, one or two quick ones.
328320	330480	So yeah, let's get to it then.
330480	332080	So we can really goof off.
334240	341120	So for anyone who's new to the podcast, maybe now isn't a good time to jump in.
341120	342400	Yeah, don't be here right now.
342400	343200	Yeah.
343200	344640	Go back to the first one.
344640	348560	Maybe this is the best time to grasp as much as you can.
349120	354720	Oh yeah, you can form a study guide and then go back to the beginning and re-listen to everything.
354720	359360	If you're one of those people who reads the last page of every book you read before you read it,
359360	362080	then yeah, then we don't want you listening to a podcast.
363120	363840	Fuck you.
363840	367920	This is going to be, uh, extreme spoiler heavy.
367920	371680	Spoilers you may not have even known existed before today.
372400	374480	Well, hopefully we're going to avoid some of that.
374480	380800	Basically what I'm going to reinforce here is going to be a look back at many of the
380800	386240	things we've forgotten and then basically just like theories and opinions from each
386240	391440	of the players on what is happening and what their plans are moving forward.
391440	394320	Luke just vaped in against the zoom green screen.
394320	395360	It looked fucking awesome.
395360	403360	All right guys, uh, first question comes from Glue B and it says,
403360	407520	what NPCs besides Drew do you trust the most?
407520	408880	None of them anymore.
408880	411680	Probably, um, oh, what's his face?
412480	413120	Daily.
413120	413760	Gary Daily.
413760	414880	That's a really good answer.
414880	416160	At the Daily-fa.
416160	417840	Daily and, and clinker.
417840	418880	Yeah, I definitely trust him.
418880	420400	Harry clinker of clinkers.
420480	426240	Who's the one that saw us or like put a spell on us when we were kids or something?
426240	427200	Uh, clinker, right?
427760	428960	Because it was in his daycare.
429680	433520	It wasn't his daycare, but it was his partner Gary Daily.
433520	434320	Okay, cool.
434320	436000	Yeah, that's my answer.
436720	438720	Yeah, that's a, that's a good dude.
438720	443600	We should, once we go back to contention, if we do, we'll probably get in contact with him.
444240	447520	And, and John Lee Pettymore still trusts his family.
447520	452880	Thomas, you actually asked the question when I had you guys ask questions and I would answer
452880	459280	them in dreams for you, uh, in which I really didn't answer the questions, but, uh, just
459280	462720	made weird fucked up dreams surrounding the idea of your question.
462720	466960	You asked if you could trust Gary Daily and Harry clinker.
466960	472480	And that's when you, that's where the scene of him putting the spell on us was, right?
472480	472960	Yeah.
472960	475600	And you also saw like his grandpa.
475600	478640	You later confirmed in a phone call on the way to the city.
479280	482240	You saw him like with the book.
482240	482560	Yeah.
482560	485280	He was, he was like, grandpa, you old wizard.
486080	488080	Joe, write that down so we can get back to it.
488080	492720	When we, what about you, Joe?
492720	498480	Clark definitely still, uh, has a lot of trust in Maggie just because of how their relationship
498480	500160	was before all the shit hit the fan.
500960	505840	He also has a little bit of trust in old Clark just because it's old him.
505840	510480	Like he sees his own face and thinks that I would, why would old me want to fuck me over?
511600	517760	And, uh, uh, until recently, I think, uh, Leon was high on his trust list and maybe
517760	522880	he's questioning that a little more these days, but yeah, a lot of, a lot of trust in
522880	523680	Maggie for sure.
524640	524880	Oh.
524880	532000	And, uh, he, he also still feels pretty strongly about his, uh, his, uh, fellow officers.
532000	535840	I don't think that he has a, a lot of mistrust in them right now.
535840	537600	I'd say the same for Keith.
537600	537920	Yeah.
538640	541360	Oh, uh, my niece, my niece, for sure.
543280	543840	Your niece.
548080	549040	She's family, you know,
551280	552080	bigger than blood.
554560	558000	Keith can trust anyone who he's killed because they can't betray him.
560560	565840	Um, this next one comes from the lay suit for the boys.
565840	566960	That's how I would say it.
566960	568480	I think, yeah, I think it's Lejuet.
569200	569680	The Lejuet.
569680	571200	Oh, I wouldn't.
571200	572880	Or Lejuet.
572880	573040	Yeah.
573040	574960	Like a, like a leisure Jesuit.
574960	575760	Maybe.
575760	576160	Maybe.
577200	577760	Yeah.
577760	579680	Oh, my mom was a leisure Jesuit.
579680	582560	Oh, I'll say.
582560	588400	They write for the boys, what hooks slash bangs do you wish you had followed up on?
588960	591280	And what are some of your favorite bangs?
591840	596240	Uh, I wish that we would have not royally fucked up when we saw that guy in the woods.
596960	597440	Yeah.
597440	597760	Yeah.
597760	598240	Great one.
598240	600240	That was, that was all about the roles though.
600240	600880	Kinda.
600880	601120	Yeah.
601120	603200	I mean, we didn't necessarily do anything wrong.
603200	604800	We just rolled terribly.
604800	610640	I want to say each of you rolled a critical failure, like a critical, critical failure
610720	614320	within like five minutes of each other.
614320	619280	Also, did we ever follow up on the note you got from the robot guy?
619280	619840	Not really.
620960	621600	That's one too.
621600	622320	What did it say?
622960	624480	Uh, hold on.
625040	626800	I was just reading this earlier.
626800	629120	I think, I think I know if you can't find it.
629120	633440	Remember when we were recording both the dog and I said a robot massage, and I thought
633440	638320	that was really funny that John Lee Fattimore was in love with a robot and got a massage
638320	645280	from, I mean, they would be good at it.
645280	648160	I bet if they were programmed for massaging.
648800	649360	Yeah.
649360	650880	You got to think about that.
650880	653360	Well, you got to think about the build structure.
653360	657520	I mean, you're not going to be metal, you know, if you're made from massaging, you're
657520	665040	going to have to come up with some very, very human like parts to get in there.
666000	667920	To really get in there.
667920	669920	Is your chiropractor a robot, Zach?
669920	674000	Yeah, but that's just because they're the best chiropractors.
674800	675440	Exactly.
675440	676480	And he's got no heart.
677760	680480	You need a man with no heart to really crack his spine.
680480	682560	Even if I die, my spine will be straight.
682560	682880	Yes.
682880	687200	And no, in the review, it just says that I sent it off to Drew to see what it says.
687760	690960	And it says, I killed the, oh wait, sorry.
690960	692160	Do you know it, Joe?
692160	694640	Yeah, it's I killed the chief's pops, John.
694640	695120	Right.
695120	696480	That's exactly what it says.
696480	698320	Word for word in binary.
701200	702160	Write that down, Joe.
706160	706960	Make a note of it.
706960	710000	See what, who else or what else?
710000	715120	I wrote down that I, uh, I wish we would have, um, explored the helmet some more.
715120	718720	We, we kind of got it and tucked it away and never really researched it.
718720	720240	I would have liked to have known more about it.
720240	721520	Who has the helmet now?
721520	722160	We do.
722160	722720	Oh, fuck.
723360	726480	Oh my God.
726480	729040	The cat's just knocked down my, uh, soundproof blanket.
731120	732800	Well, it made a whole lot of noise.
732800	733360	Ironic.
737600	738960	But yeah, for sure.
738960	742880	The, uh, the helmet would have been interesting.
742880	747520	I mean, you guys had a pretty long scene, uh, but none of the focus was on the helmet.
747520	753280	It was just on, um, you know, Luke and Keith Vigna and pastor Adam Kane.
754080	757600	Not liking, uh, each other pretty, pretty clearly.
758480	764080	Actually, I don't even think Keith Vigna like thought about pastor Adam Kane except for himself.
767200	768560	He gave me some food.
768560	770480	The second part of that was what are your favorite bangs?
770480	776400	I was a big fan the very first time we ever saw a creepy picture come out of that Polaroid camera.
776400	777920	I don't know if you consider that a bang or not.
777920	781600	That's pretty integral to the story, but it came out for sure.
781600	781840	Cool.
781840	784240	That's like a set charge, right?
784240	786960	It's like when they use this, this will happen.
786960	792880	It's like, I love doing this with people and locations once we're like into the game to be
792880	798240	like, it's up to them if they want to make this happen, but if they reach out to this person,
798240	801680	this will unlock this plot essentially.
801840	808720	It's like, if you happen to decide to call someone, then you're going to make something
808720	813760	happen there because you're not just going to call them and have nothing be happening, right?
814560	818400	Something will be happening, but if you don't call them, it's up to me to decide at that point,
818400	820960	like, well, what happened?
820960	826640	Is it still this interesting convoluted story or would that not be as interesting because
826640	827760	they weren't there for it?
828320	830160	I always want you guys there for the action.
831040	837120	So I don't know if this was a bang probably, but when Keith snuck on the bus and then all
837120	843120	the homeless people got on and I was stuck on it and you guys know what happened.
845840	846720	That was pretty good.
846720	849520	That was just their like written trajectory for that scene.
849520	853760	It's like, these people are going to do this and these are their objectives and this is
853760	854800	how they're going to do it.
854800	858960	And then you got into the exact bus that they were going to leave on.
860160	868400	Thomas, did you have a good hooker bang that, that really hooked you into the door while
868400	868960	hooking you?
870880	876800	Leo piston and, um, what's your face's body literally being banged, uh, banged into the
876800	878240	ground by the unseen forces.
879040	879760	Ooh, fuck.
879760	880320	Yeah.
880320	884400	That was a disturbing imagery moment that I personally loved.
884400	884640	Yes.
885280	887440	That certainly got John Lee Pettymore's attention.
888080	888640	That's awesome.
889200	896480	That was one of those things where I don't plan a lot in advance for like how things
896480	897440	are going to play out.
898000	904080	I did not expect Clark to critically succeed on a firearms check and kill her.
904880	906560	Old eagle eye Bishop.
906560	907280	You know it.
907280	910480	We got a next question here from super five-ish.
910480	915280	Super fish or super fish with a five is a F is super five-ish says what happened to
915280	921680	the grammar, poor torch-wielding would be invaders hinted at in the early episodes.
921680	923280	Are they still kicking about?
923280	927200	And this is, uh, this is in the, one of those pictures that you were talking about there,
927200	930400	Joe, but this is the picture I believe that was well.
930400	930720	Okay.
930720	937520	So I, I don't, I mean, I think that that is part of what is like being alluded to, but
937520	940880	I think he's referencing the note that we got it because when he said grammar poor,
941680	948000	it says we are striking with darkness, reading torches, hesitate, not, um, and it says,
948000	949360	are they still kicking about?
949360	950320	I don't, I don't know.
950320	954720	I assume it has something to do with the picture we saw of people holding torches, but I don't
954720	955220	know.
956080	956640	Yeah.
956640	958720	I completely misread that question.
958720	962080	I had to think about it when they, when they said grammar poor, I was like, who was grammar
962080	962480	poor?
962480	968560	And then I remember I thought we could all just tell from the picture of them that they
968560	969440	looked like they didn't know.
971040	972400	So any ideas?
972400	974320	I, we got a question about that now.
974320	975360	Let's just jump to it now.
975360	976320	Where is it?
976320	984400	A non a no, no, no asks when that cloud portal yeeted John Peters at the boy's car, where
984400	985680	was he thrown from?
985680	988960	Is that the place the spooky picture depicts?
988960	989460	Yeah.
990720	991600	I think so.
991600	992560	I like to think so.
992560	997120	Cause we had seen John Peters in the stocks in those pictures and it was that inky black
997120	997840	void.
997840	1002880	So I fear he, if he was there and then not there, maybe he got spit out, but no, there's
1002880	1004720	nothing being confirmed one way or the other.
1004720	1006560	What's your computer notes say, Zach?
1008160	1010320	It just says in all caps.
1010320	1010960	Oh fuck.
1010960	1011920	Come up with something.
1015280	1016320	No, it's the answer.
1016320	1018000	It just, I'm looking at the answer.
1018000	1019440	Do you guys want me to screen share with you?
1020080	1026080	I've got a question here from the leisure for me or for someone who's got a name that
1026080	1027840	sounds like mine, but is spelled differently.
1027840	1032880	It's for Zach with a K from the original timeline slash campaign slash thing.
1032880	1036160	What dangling hooks do you wish the boys would have followed up on?
1037600	1043200	Yeah, I'd probably say the grammar poor torch wielding would be invaders hinted at in the
1043200	1044080	early episode.
1044080	1045120	Hey Joe, write that down.
1047600	1051040	By the, by the nature of the game and the story you're telling, there's nothing that
1051040	1054640	we couldn't like go back and follow up on if we really felt the need to.
1055360	1056400	That's absolutely correct.
1056400	1059920	Things might've changed since we first saw it, but there's no reason we couldn't go and
1060640	1062400	do a little more research on something.
1062400	1063360	Absolutely.
1063360	1068720	I think the next arc is going to start with you wake up and you're on four wheelers driving
1068720	1069840	to the woods.
1071200	1072880	Don't fuck up this time.
1072880	1074320	Well now I've got to change it.
1075040	1077280	Oh, just edit that part out.
1077280	1082160	Oh, we got another question here from Maladory asks Ari Manstein feels more important than
1082160	1083760	they have been given credit.
1083760	1088000	What were they and why were they working with the CPD?
1088000	1091440	Also, what about Jan Manstein and Stan Manstein for that matter?
1091440	1094400	Why could the only the boys understand Stan at the meaner?
1094400	1095920	Yeah, the fuck me.
1095920	1099360	And what does he mean by our past is different?
1099360	1101680	That's a loaded and a lot.
1101680	1102560	I I've got it.
1102560	1103360	I've got a theory.
1103360	1104080	I don't know.
1104080	1105040	What's your theory?
1105040	1106800	Stan obviously seems super important.
1106800	1112000	He was telling us a lot of really good info before we tried to kill him, but he was talking
1112000	1118240	about how pasts have changed and so I mean there's some kind of timey wimey thing that
1118240	1122320	for some reason we're all sure that we remember different names for Ari.
1123280	1126960	He kind of alluded to the fact that that's not going to happen anymore that she's a fixed
1126960	1131040	point in some way and that his his life is definite or her life is definite now.
1131040	1135120	I don't know, but he seemed to know a lot about how all this timey wimey shit is working
1135120	1138960	and I don't really grasp it all, but it seems super important.
1138960	1139600	I agree.
1139600	1140640	Hey, I've got a question.
1140720	1143360	I want you all to answer it on the count of three.
1144000	1147280	Who is the dentist in contention?
1147840	1149840	Do you have an answer in your mind?
1149840	1152960	I mean, I definitely can picture him and I know his business card.
1152960	1153520	Yeah.
1153520	1155120	I don't remember his name exactly.
1155120	1155680	Old man.
1156480	1157280	Moller?
1157280	1157920	Moller?
1159360	1164960	Well, so there was the the guy who told us he was a dentist, but he was helping settle
1164960	1167280	the estate right of James.
1167280	1168800	Yeah, he shit his pants.
1168800	1171120	But that is not Dr. Moller.
1171120	1175840	Right, there's a more of a real dentist or as he was not so much a dentist, maybe is
1175840	1177520	what we gathered from his card.
1177520	1179120	When did we meet a real dentist?
1179120	1183120	We didn't meet and we sent off dental records to a dentist one time.
1183120	1184640	Oh, I forget for what body.
1185200	1188880	It was for the body of Chief Maggie Cook.
1188880	1190640	Right, in the house explosion.
1190640	1191120	Yeah.
1191120	1192160	What was his name?
1192160	1194080	Was it another Andrews sibling?
1195040	1197680	No, his name was Randy Angst.
1197760	1198400	Randy Angst.
1198400	1201600	The guy who was at James the mill worker's house with you guys.
1201600	1205120	His business card said dentist and lover or something like that, right?
1205120	1207360	And historical society.
1207360	1207840	Yeah.
1207840	1208480	Yeah.
1208480	1213280	But yeah, just to point out that you guys sent off dental records to the only dentist
1213280	1217920	in town, Dr. Moller, and then you met a dentist named Randy Angst.
1218800	1219440	Write that down.
1220160	1221520	That's just a thing that happened.
1222080	1223360	Probably not important though.
1223360	1228480	I mean, I think we all noted it at the time that it was weird that he was settling in
1228480	1232480	a state and his card had like four different occupations on it.
1232480	1233360	But yeah, I don't know.
1233360	1234400	Yeah, I agree.
1234400	1236720	Thomas, do you have any theories about Ari Manstein?
1237280	1239200	I don't know who that is.
1242320	1244400	Tim Manstein was a colleague of mine.
1246320	1248160	One of the finest cops I ever knew.
1248640	1254640	Um, uh, yeah, we're actually going to be attending their funeral soon.
1254640	1257760	I think I got a question here from crane song.
1257760	1262720	Zach, what was the decision made by the players that stands out to you as the most derailing
1262720	1263840	what you had planned?
1263840	1267200	We know that you parenthetical allegedly.
1268160	1268800	I don't lie.
1269360	1274720	Had to rewrite the campaign after someone Thomas joked about it being the mine.
1274720	1278080	Were there any other parts of the campaign that had to be redone?
1278080	1283280	Any really, really, really obvious plot points that the players bypassed or previously pivotal
1283280	1286160	characters that were either killed or ignored?
1286160	1290960	I'm just imagining Zach control effing mine and changing it to mill every time.
1293840	1295120	Control H, baby.
1295760	1298880	So yeah, that was Thomas who did the mine thing.
1298880	1302000	And that was when I was still writing the story and I was like, yeah, you're right.
1302000	1303280	I shouldn't make it that.
1303680	1311600	Um, but, um, like rewritten, uh, constantly, I would, yeah, I rewrite stuff literally all
1311600	1312320	the time.
1312320	1317280	If you guys do something to affect my plan, then I have to rewrite everything.
1317280	1320240	And that happens like every single time we sit down to play.
1320240	1324480	Cause you guys are fun to play with, you make choices.
1324480	1329680	And that's the thing that matters most in role-playing is, uh, we're making the story
1329680	1330160	together.
1330160	1333200	So every time you make a choice, I get to play with that choice.
1334080	1337040	And that's why I like role-playing I'm with you.
1337680	1338800	That was the question, right?
1338800	1339440	Yeah.
1339440	1340480	I think you got it.
1340480	1342960	Obvious plot points that the players bypassed.
1342960	1343760	Yeah, of course.
1345280	1345760	All right.
1345760	1348480	So we've got a question here.
1348480	1350400	I was about to tell Joe to write it down.
1353120	1358400	Oh, previously pivotal characters that were either killed or ignored, uh, just on the
1358480	1359360	killed part.
1359360	1360560	Like, yeah, for sure.
1361600	1363040	Got a murderous crew.
1364000	1370480	I like straight up for one did not think that that car chase with Charles Donovan was going
1370480	1372480	to end in his murder.
1373680	1374560	Who would have done that?
1377520	1382560	I also didn't think you were going to murder every single person you came into contact
1382560	1384800	with at city state university.
1384800	1388480	They were coming right for us.
1392320	1392800	Oh boy.
1394320	1398480	We got one from a non, uh, no, no, no.
1399520	1405680	And they said, when that cloud portal yeeted John Peters at the boy's car, where was he
1405680	1406880	thrown from?
1406880	1409200	Is that the place the spooky picture depicts?
1411920	1412640	We did this one.
1413600	1414800	Oh, well, thanks.
1417760	1422160	Uh, go ahead and hit that antiseptic mouthwash goat sex picture.
1424240	1425920	Just wanted to share things.
1425920	1430080	And what happened to those kids that, that saw the gooey vacuum?
1430080	1430480	Thanks.
1431120	1432320	There were no kids.
1432320	1435440	And I don't, I don't know, uh, what vacuum incident you're talking about.
1436800	1438640	That's not a, that's not a thing.
1438640	1439440	Joe, Joe, no, no.
1439440	1447120	When we, when we got those kids killed, cause we, well, yeah.
1447120	1450960	Instead of telling them to run away or something, we told them to hold a vacuum.
1452880	1454960	No, we wouldn't have done that.
1454960	1455680	That's ridiculous.
1455680	1456480	No, they died.
1457360	1460240	That's I can't believe I wasn't involved in that one.
1462640	1464320	We can never let Vigna know.
1466000	1468080	We really keep those kids up.
1468640	1476960	Oh, so on the way to the city, you guys were on the phone with Harry Klinker on speakerphone
1476960	1479200	and John told that whole story.
1480240	1485520	With Keith in the car and Doug Jacobs in the body of agent Trent and Chad also in the car.
1485520	1488880	I tried to tell Trent Chad that it was like part of his trip, right?
1488880	1490560	That he was dreaming it or something.
1490560	1491120	Yeah.
1491120	1491600	Yeah.
1491600	1494080	And then that he was like, I don't know.
1494080	1495040	And he's like, no, no, no.
1495040	1496800	They just talk to each other like this all the time.
1497760	1498240	Yeah.
1498320	1505520	We got another one from J sake, which they wanted to make sure is not pronounced J sake
1506320	1508320	for audio formatting purposes.
1508320	1513040	I pronounce it like quote for sake, not Japanese rice wine.
1513920	1520560	J sake's question is does the daily pho have a yellow sign hanging on the wall?
1521200	1523200	Ain't on a no, no, no, no.
1523200	1526240	No, they commented.
1526240	1529040	Are we talking a specific yellow sign?
1529040	1531760	TM J state comments back.
1531760	1532880	I think so.
1532880	1534480	I'm doing a quarantine release.
1535280	1540320	I'm doing a quarantine re listen.
1540320	1545760	And when the art Gary has on the walls of the restaurant is described, it kind of sounds
1545760	1551600	like one is the yellow sign, not a yellow sign, if you know what I mean, but it could
1551600	1553440	be some other occult symbol.
1553440	1554720	I'm not familiar with.
1554720	1558640	I went back and listened to the description of all those things on the walls.
1558640	1563840	And one of them definitely sounds like a yellow sign description, but none of our characters
1563840	1568400	would know that like, there's no way that they would know that is what that is.
1568400	1575040	I bet John Lee Pettymore saw like the first 30 minutes of the first season of true detective
1575680	1577360	and didn't get it and turned it off.
1577360	1582000	Oh, thankfully they use a different yellow sign.
1582000	1584160	Also, the yellow sign can be anything.
1584160	1585840	They can look like anything.
1585840	1589760	So, but there is one that looks a whole heck of a lot.
1589760	1594000	Like when I Googled yellow sign, it sounded exactly like something you described.
1594960	1597840	Yeah, it does.
1597840	1598480	Doesn't it?
1599360	1600720	Looks like one of those things.
1601040	1609680	And then when, when you asked him what that one meant, he said, oh, that one is about
1609680	1611680	a land unknown.
1611680	1617520	Yeah, which we, we kind of took for granted because it's described as like question marks
1617520	1621840	kind of like it was a question mark with a line coming out the other side and yada, yada,
1621840	1622480	yada.
1622480	1627040	When I originally read that question, I thought it was a reference to like the yellow missing
1627040	1627840	signs.
1627840	1628720	And I was like, huh?
1631600	1634000	But now I realize nothing to do with that.
1634000	1635120	Speaking of nothing.
1636320	1636800	Okay.
1636800	1640880	Nothing for wrote us a question.
1640880	1641760	Look out world.
1641760	1642160	Sorry.
1642160	1645680	I am a transition guy.
1645680	1646400	Um, okay.
1646400	1650240	Nothing for wrote a question.
1655040	1657920	They wrote a question I actually was curious about too.
1657920	1664400	What happened to the FBI agents who visited the contention PD and said they'd be in contact
1664400	1668080	within 48 hours and Maladory followed up?
1668080	1673040	Weren't the agents at the den of sin when Marvin got terminated or were those different
1673040	1673760	agents?
1673760	1678560	Well, didn't the FBI agents say that they would call us if we didn't call them?
1678560	1679120	That's for sure.
1679120	1679680	Part of it.
1679680	1681600	And then we, we tried to call them.
1681600	1682160	Yeah.
1682160	1685120	Keith called them and got an automated, uh, system.
1685680	1685920	Yeah.
1685920	1690160	So we just kind of laid out that we needed to contact them, ask them stuff or something.
1690160	1691920	And it just was like, thank you.
1691920	1692640	Have a good day.
1693280	1695760	So that thread kind of ended.
1696720	1700720	And then, yeah, as far as the den of sin goes, I think that's what I'm operating under is
1700720	1704480	that that was them that we saw in the audience going into Marvin's room.
1705680	1709040	And I think I brought up with you guys that we don't know for sure what the fuck that
1709040	1709440	means.
1709440	1714560	That could mean that they are on Marvin's payroll maybe, or they had followed us into
1714560	1717520	the glass compound and we're trying to help.
1717520	1718160	I don't know.
1718160	1719440	I don't know what they were doing there.
1719440	1721760	I think we, we still would like to talk to them.
1724160	1732800	And their goal in front of your eyes, like what you saw was them get rid of silver or
1732800	1738880	not even get rid of, but just put one silver ball that none of them were touching into
1738880	1740160	the Nike bag.
1740160	1744240	Maybe the Nike bag teleported it to glass.
1744240	1745200	Straight to glass.
1745200	1746080	That's that could be.
1747040	1749040	I think you guys have had this conversation before.
1749760	1752160	I think we might've done it off the podcast one day.
1752160	1752960	Oh yeah.
1752960	1759760	I was reading, I was reading the overview of episode 34 and it's one where it's, I
1759760	1765920	think it's right before the entity shows up to yell at Clark Bishop about the book.
1765920	1771840	And you guys are all standing in the mausoleum courtyard, essentially, and just talking about
1771920	1773680	the plot for the entire time.
1773680	1779200	And the overview of that episode is just like intense plot point after intense plot point
1779200	1781520	after intense plot point after intense plot point.
1781520	1786880	So yeah, if you want to go for listeners 34, if you want to go back and listen to them,
1786880	1789520	try to figure some stuff out before we hop into this.
1789520	1793680	I mean, I know that's what this is, but damn, that episode is chock full of shit.
1793680	1794240	Nice.
1794240	1796240	I'll have to go back and listen to that one too.
1796240	1796800	All right.
1796800	1800320	Moving right along crush 36 rights.
1800960	1802480	Who do the robots work for?
1803200	1808800	Were the graveyard boys, robots or glass type dudes that we fought the first robot guy and
1808800	1814160	he had the, uh, so it was the double helix sees that created an M that we have like on
1814160	1815200	a ring and stuff.
1815200	1820080	We later found out from old Clark's Heidi hole in Jim Cook's house.
1820080	1820720	It's myriad.
1820720	1825760	It stands for myriad, which is a company that I think creates androids.
1825760	1831680	The, it was in operation stapler that they were like cutting costs on androids.
1831680	1832080	Yeah.
1832080	1836880	So yeah, I don't, did we find out who myriad was or what they were, what they were associated
1836880	1837520	with?
1837520	1840800	Were they owned or did they own the beans corporation?
1840800	1842400	I'll have to ask Keith's brother.
1844000	1853600	Bruce Robin was extremely emotionally affected by Keith having a myriad ring.
1853600	1854320	Oh, that's right.
1854320	1859680	When we were in the office, he saw your ring and was like, oh, he, did he have one on two?
1859680	1861920	He was really embarrassed by the faux pas.
1864240	1865200	How dare you?
1865840	1867520	He, he did have one on two, right?
1867520	1869120	Cause I tried to like touch them together.
1869120	1869760	I think.
1869760	1871040	Or am I making that up?
1871040	1872240	I don't, I don't remember.
1872240	1872800	I don't either.
1872800	1874160	I don't have an overview for that one.
1874720	1875520	You should get on that.
1875520	1883440	Then Zach, I'm just kidding for the listener.
1883440	1888400	It's our job to write some of these overviews and we suck at doing that on time.
1889120	1891040	We're like half the season behind.
1891840	1893280	I did two of them the other day.
1893280	1896640	It doesn't take very long if you listen at double speed.
1896640	1899920	However, I will say one of them was already done.
1899920	1900400	Shit.
1900400	1901040	Which one?
1901040	1902080	And Joe had done it.
1902080	1903520	So it was way more in depth.
1906480	1909120	I put on only the good stuff in there.
1909920	1911200	I didn't write a transcript.
1911200	1916640	Oh, Joe's putting a lot of fluff in those overviews.
1916640	1918400	He's putting up his font size.
1919200	1920880	He's not paying us by the word, Joe.
1923440	1925520	I can start paying you by the word if you want.
1925520	1926960	Oh, mine'll be so long.
1926960	1928480	It was the best of soads.
1928480	1929840	It was the worst of soads.
1931840	1935520	I'm always so nervous that Zach's word choice is going to be super important.
1935520	1940160	So if he says like her grimacing face,
1940160	1943440	I'm going to put in that grimacing just in case that means something later.
1944080	1947120	It only does like 25% of the time, but that's pretty high.
1948960	1952560	And then graveyard boys, robots or glass type dudes.
1952560	1955600	They weren't fish, if that was what the question was.
1956480	1959120	Did we ever investigate their bodies?
1959120	1961520	We didn't think they were fish, but they were weird,
1961520	1964080	like alien creature kind of things, right?
1964080	1965840	Oh, those boys.
1966800	1974560	The long, tall, like lanky gray entity that like,
1974560	1977440	and wearing a full suit screamed at Clark.
1977440	1979600	It screamed at me and I didn't know what the fuck.
1979600	1982240	But yeah, even at the time, I think we noted that it was,
1982240	1985600	there was a similar description between them and Marvin himself.
1986320	1989440	We wondered if they were of the same ilk.
1990480	1991200	Yeah, man.
1992560	1994400	I mean, yeah, they're described the same.
1994480	1995360	They look very similar.
1997600	1998400	Write that down.
1998400	2002480	They don't act the same at all though, which is an important distinction.
2002480	2007040	They certainly don't, but they also probably aren't human
2007040	2009120	based on those descriptions that I gave.
2010560	2013440	Not a lot of eight foot tall humans walking around.
2014480	2016560	Not a lot, Zach, but they're out there.
2016560	2017600	There are some.
2017600	2018080	Enough.
2019840	2022080	I don't think there's anyone eight feet tall in the world right now.
2022720	2025440	What Zach is saying is that if you're over eight feet tall,
2025440	2027120	he doesn't consider you human.
2027760	2030320	I completely agree with that.
2030320	2031840	Oh my God.
2031840	2034640	Watch fucking Chuckling Boy be like eight foot five.
2042720	2044720	Friendship with PTBP over.
2044720	2045520	Oh boy.
2046880	2049280	Speaking of, we got a question from Jayhawk Inc.
2049280	2051840	More from him later or her them later.
2051840	2054960	Are there any things that have quote official names
2054960	2057600	that haven't been named as such in the podcast?
2057600	2058240	Yes.
2058240	2061840	Like I don't remember the chanting fish men being called deep ones.
2061840	2062640	They weren't.
2062640	2064640	And they discovered that trove of weapons,
2064640	2067840	but only Joe mentioned that it was likely a green box out of character.
2067840	2070080	I'm curious if we've like seen a ghoul.
2070080	2071680	No, but didn't realize it was a ghoul.
2071680	2073600	No, because no one called it that, you know?
2074560	2076640	Yeah, probably no ghouls, but maybe.
2076640	2077520	I don't know.
2077520	2080240	I like to make ghouls look different than traditional ghouls.
2080880	2083920	I used ghouls heavily in a former campaign.
2084480	2085280	Eight foot tall.
2085280	2095840	So, you know, they weren't human creatures that tortured Joe's character's family.
2097600	2102240	He like woke up with like with like graveyard dirt all over him one night
2102240	2103840	and was like, what's going on?
2103840	2105040	That sounds just like Joe.
2107520	2108880	So yeah, definitely.
2109760	2111040	And also no.
2111040	2113360	Maladory has one for us.
2113360	2114800	So a question about ball.
2115520	2118560	If ball contains consciousness of some people,
2118560	2122400	how did it have John Pettymore the third's original body?
2122400	2128640	Also, how come some ball seems to act with intelligence when they take a body
2128640	2131360	and some kill themselves or go berserk?
2131360	2132400	That's a question about ball.
2133360	2135200	Excellent question about ball.
2135440	2139200	So I went through all these questions and typed out just little thoughts on all of them.
2139200	2140560	And this is one that I wrote.
2140560	2143040	I still don't know anything about ball.
2143040	2144400	Yeah, exactly.
2145120	2146880	I don't understand it.
2146880	2148080	No fucking clue.
2148080	2151120	I don't know for sure if I'm ball or not, but it's been implied for sure.
2151680	2154080	I don't know what that would mean for me or not for me.
2154080	2156960	I don't know much about ball at all.
2156960	2160080	Something we maybe should follow up on.
2160080	2161040	I don't know how though.
2161680	2164960	It seems like ball central was Marvin Glass's compound.
2166160	2167680	It does seem that way.
2167680	2168800	Let's head on back, boys.
2169360	2170800	We can still go.
2172640	2181280	No, if you'll remember, we were planning on going back there to intercept,
2182480	2184800	was it the FBI agents before they got killed?
2185440	2188160	We were going to talk to somebody and then Maggie showed up and she's like,
2188240	2189520	this will only take two hours.
2189520	2191200	And then all the university shit happened.
2192400	2193520	Yeah, I don't think so.
2193520	2194320	It's like the mill.
2194320	2195680	Zach doesn't want us to do that.
2199920	2202560	When I was reading back over the overview,
2202560	2207680	I noted in one of the overviews that I wrote early on and said,
2207680	2210400	they chose not to go to the mill.
2212080	2212580	Wow.
2212580	2218180	Well, this next one comes from crush 36.
2218180	2220260	I don't know if you all have any more ball thoughts.
2220260	2221460	No, no, that was perfect.
2221460	2225300	I have tons of plot ball thoughts, but you know,
2225300	2227860	can we, can we real fast think about all the balls we've seen?
2231140	2234340	For real though, I know the first one it was in,
2234340	2238420	it was in the potential green box in a tub that was filled with gore.
2238420	2241700	And when we opened it, it was a woman's head in the middle of it,
2241700	2244260	split open with a ball sitting in the middle of it.
2245060	2247540	So that was our first encounter with ball.
2248500	2249460	Ball one.
2249460	2252100	Is that the ball that you had in your pocket, Thomas?
2252100	2252980	I think so, right?
2252980	2253700	I believe so.
2254260	2257620	We've got tub head ball that then John pocketed.
2258260	2262900	And then the agents McKinley and Kennedy had their own ball.
2262900	2265220	When we, when we brought them the Nike bag,
2265220	2268500	they brought their own ball out of their pocket and popped it into the bag.
2268500	2270420	And we didn't tell them that we already had a ball.
2270420	2271220	I don't think.
2271300	2273140	So that's two balls we know of now.
2274180	2277540	Third ball would be whatever John himself is, right?
2277540	2279620	He or was the ball in his pocket.
2279620	2280340	What became him?
2280340	2281060	Do we know that?
2281060	2283620	I don't know if my character knows that and it's been said, I don't know.
2284180	2286420	So we don't have to say motherfucker.
2288420	2289700	You, you did, right?
2289700	2292580	Didn't you say that you were ball in your dad's body?
2292580	2294420	And then you were like, I think we're all ball.
2294420	2297300	I'm pretty sure that conversation happened at the cemetery.
2297300	2300580	Yeah, but I'm saying if I was the ball that I picked up and put in my pocket
2301060	2302820	and that's, that's how I became ball.
2302820	2304100	That would, that'd be big news.
2304100	2305620	I don't think that's true though.
2305620	2309140	And then, so the ball that was in Marvin's possession.
2309140	2309380	Right.
2309380	2315220	That, uh, Rosemary flung or no Marvin flung it at Rosemary, but yeah.
2315220	2316900	Do we know the origin of that ball?
2316900	2322260	Do we know if that was, came out of John's pocket maybe when we were last there?
2322260	2327300	Keith had seen videos of kids in rooms.
2328020	2331380	They tried to get them to touch the ball and it would come kill them.
2331940	2335780	So it seemed like maybe that ball had been there for a while.
2335780	2343460	Cause they had tapes and tapes and tapes of kids getting, it would rip their spines out
2343460	2345300	or tear them apart, right?
2345300	2351780	I believe it would rip their spines out and enter them and then repeatedly slam their
2351780	2355780	own head into the wall until they fell.
2355780	2358020	Are those all our ball thoughts today?
2358020	2361220	I think that's every ball accounted for that we know of.
2361220	2365140	So when you guys were standing on the water and Marvin Glass
2365140	2367700	pulled up the body of John Wayne Pennymore.
2367700	2368820	Oh yeah, that's right.
2370020	2371300	He popped it open like a jar.
2372580	2375460	I know plot-wise that didn't happen very long ago, but
2375460	2380100	has enough real-time past that you'll let me listen to those episodes, Zach?
2381540	2381780	Yeah.
2381780	2383700	Pump up them numbers, baby.
2383700	2387460	Slap some ads on there and then you guys can go back and re-listen everything.
2390660	2395940	Also, I'm wearing a pair of, I'm wearing a pair of MeUndies right now and they're super
2395940	2396500	comfortable.
2398180	2402020	My mattress isn't a Casper mattress, but boy, do I wish it was.
2405460	2411220	Man, I heard if you go to MeUndies.com and type in pretending to wear underwear,
2411220	2412660	you could get 15% off.
2412820	2413780	Long coupon.
2416580	2416980	All right.
2417380	2417700	Hold on.
2417700	2419140	I got a bag of chips I need to eat.
2421940	2425620	Maladori writes, back at the campsite flashback.
2425620	2427220	Oh, did you guys talk about the homeless people?
2427220	2428020	No, you skipped one.
2428020	2428520	Oh, did I?
2429140	2429540	Oh, shit.
2429540	2429860	Sorry.
2429860	2430340	Okay.
2430340	2433220	Our favorite fan, Crush 36 writes,
2436740	2437220	JK.
2437940	2438500	Crush 36.
2438500	2444100	Oh, it sounds bad no matter what I do.
2445700	2450100	Crush 36 writes, I'm re-listening on episode four.
2450100	2452420	What was up with all the homeless people?
2452420	2455300	I feel like I remember some call back to them later,
2455300	2458580	but it's not stuck in my head like the other major plot points.
2460180	2461140	I can take this one.
2462340	2463300	We found out all about them.
2463620	2471940	At Glass's facility, we rescued Kathy Piston and she kind of filled us in that she was
2471940	2476980	trafficking those homeless people to both the Circle of Knowledge and Marvin Glass.
2477700	2478820	Did you say you rescued her?
2479460	2480020	Oh, right.
2480020	2482740	Well, we took her down off the hook and talked to her for a while.
2485860	2488740	She was our MVP in the fish man fight.
2488740	2492820	She kept sniping dudes down and then a sickle got her right to the...
2492900	2493380	That's right.
2494260	2499060	I went back to listen to that episode so I could make sure that I wasn't divulging stuff
2499060	2500180	you guys didn't know.
2500180	2505220	And we did talk about this in the Circle that I told you guys, I know that the Circle of
2505220	2509620	Knowledge uses homeless people to keep the evil thing that I saw at bay.
2511140	2514260	And then I asked Kathy, so I know what the Circle of Knowledge is about.
2514260	2515540	What's Marvin using them for?
2515540	2520900	And she told us that he uses them for fights and that's all she knows and that she always
2520900	2525460	got the Circle of Knowledge homeless guys back in good, healthy shape.
2526020	2530260	Whereas the Marvin Glass guys came back, beat up and spent.
2530820	2532340	Or not at all, I believe.
2533540	2538820	Luke was just talking about seeing those videos of the experiments done with ball.
2539540	2540100	Gotcha.
2540100	2546660	And I believe it was evident that those were the people being used in those experiments
2546660	2547300	were the kids.
2547860	2548820	Orphan, no animals.
2549380	2551060	Yeah, just orphans.
2551060	2553460	Like poor ol' Walter.
2553460	2558740	I played FDR in Annie when I was in 8th grade so I can say all this.
2559860	2562820	I wore my underwear underneath my polio blanket.
2562820	2563380	Cool.
2563380	2564340	Are they me undies?
2566020	2566900	I've got a plug.
2566900	2567540	Does Casper...
2568660	2569940	Any other homeless people?
2569940	2570660	I believe not.
2570660	2572340	That was, yeah, very succinct.
2572340	2577220	I mean, there is a chance that Pastor Adam Kane is doing something with him also.
2577220	2584660	When we crashed his church, we went down into that cafeteria area.
2584660	2588580	And I think that you describe that crowd as a homeless-looking crowd.
2588580	2590180	I always knew there was something off about that guy.
2590180	2592660	I got the feeling he was like a middleman or something between.
2592660	2593380	Yeah, maybe.
2593380	2595060	Or he was in on it with the pistons.
2595060	2595620	Either way, the food was good.
2595620	2596420	He's like, I'll feed him.
2596420	2597540	You transport him.
2598180	2599460	I'll Jesus him.
2600020	2601860	You feed him the power of Christ.
2602260	2607620	Yeah, he could have been saving them all because he knew they were going off to die.
2607620	2609220	It's like a kind of nice thought.
2610420	2610740	Yeah.
2611460	2613940	I mean, he didn't try to stop it from happening.
2613940	2615940	Yeah, he seemed like that kind of guy.
2618420	2620660	Okay, express train to heaven.
2625060	2625780	Holy shit.
2625780	2627780	I love when you can buy that package at a church.
2628660	2629160	Yeah.
2631140	2634340	You're telling me all I have to do is beat up some kids in a cage?
2636100	2636820	Sign me up.
2638660	2642740	Like the Ozark mountain daredevil said, if you want to get to heaven, you got to raise a little hell.
2646820	2650660	To quote the Ozark mountain daredevils, chicken train.
2651220	2651940	Running all day.
2654020	2655620	Laser beam in my dream.
2655700	2658180	I really liked that community episode.
2658180	2662500	The chicken train one, or you got another episode here from Maladory.
2664820	2667060	We've got another episode coming up right now.
2668660	2676740	I hope Q and a special in a row.
2677300	2683060	No, I, we, Oh, I'm so excited to start playing again, but that is for the end of this.
2684020	2686500	Maladory on like five or six more Q and A's.
2690420	2692820	Back at the campsite flashback.
2692820	2698180	What was with the weird tree arm trap and mirror that threw a spear?
2698180	2702740	The only acting forces we see are K cell black goo and ball.
2703700	2706100	None of them really seem like trap people.
2706100	2709300	That's presumptuous and K cell burns the cabin.
2709300	2710500	So they weren't using it.
2711060	2713140	What does that mean?
2713140	2715620	What do you guys think that means?
2716500	2717220	It was the witch.
2718100	2720020	I've got a theory about it all.
2720980	2728260	So if you remember back to Stan Manstein's monologue, he talked about how Silas Cole
2728260	2730980	discovered the ooze and then became an inventor.
2732180	2737220	When I went into the cabin, I found plans for the gun and a bunch of tubes of ooze.
2737300	2740020	So I wonder if it has something to do with Silas Cole.
2740020	2745620	Maybe it was his laboratory or something, but the time thing is all crazy.
2745620	2749460	I don't know how any of that works out, but that's been my theory for a while now that
2749460	2750500	that has something to do with it.
2750500	2753460	Can I remind you of something else that you saw in the cabin?
2754660	2758260	It was paperwork for Cole's orphanage.
2759060	2760340	Right, right, right, right.
2760340	2762500	Further strengthening the coal ties.
2762500	2764100	Further strengthening the coal ties.
2764100	2765060	Perhaps.
2765060	2767300	I mean, it was just named after him, so who knows.
2767300	2768900	Was it named after him or his wife?
2768900	2770260	What was Mary Cole?
2770260	2771940	There was something that was named for Mary Cole.
2771940	2773460	Do we remember what that was?
2773460	2775060	I believe the library.
2775060	2776420	Oh, okay, okay, yeah.
2776420	2777220	That's been my theory.
2777220	2781460	I don't know anything really about how the traps or mirrors or weird tree and all that
2781460	2785220	stuff worked or if, I don't know.
2785220	2786020	I don't know any of it.
2786020	2789700	That's just been what I've, the two dots that I've connected myself.
2790420	2791620	What do you guys think the cabin was?
2791620	2793700	I don't know.
2794020	2797460	I mean, I didn't get to explore the woods very much.
2801540	2806100	I forgot you were stuck in a tree for a lot of episodes.
2806100	2807700	You got to become the woods.
2807700	2809220	The whole time, I think.
2809220	2814340	You hung out with some people, though, before you ran away from them.
2814340	2816420	Oh, yeah, that's right.
2816420	2821860	I got freed by the agents or whatever, but then I got killed, so I don't know.
2822740	2826260	Yeah, that was something my character didn't interact with a whole lot.
2826260	2827700	I don't know much about them.
2827700	2833780	Because they were scoping out the cabin after they freed me.
2834500	2839060	I don't really know, though, especially like the, I don't think, I don't think the weird
2839060	2841300	tree thing was like a trap necessarily.
2841300	2844100	I think it was more like supernatural.
2844100	2844900	Gotcha.
2844900	2846100	And I'm an expert on it.
2846980	2847540	Studied it.
2848740	2850740	Any other thoughts on the traps?
2850740	2856900	Yeah, Thomas, when you went into, when you got on the other side of the moat, you found
2856900	2858980	a room that I don't think anybody else went into.
2864100	2865140	What was in that room?
2869380	2874020	On the inside of the moat with the cabin, there was like a storage.
2874020	2876100	Oh, was it all the dead orphans?
2877060	2884820	It was a lot of dead bodies without their spines that were hanging like on racks with
2885540	2887220	a closet full of their clothes.
2888100	2891380	That's so spooky, which is why I must have blocked it out.
2894180	2897620	So yeah, that's like ball.
2897620	2902740	I will say when I went back and listened to those, I was super incredibly frustrated that
2902740	2907700	when I went into that room with the plans for the gun, you were like, there's these
2907700	2912100	ooze like coffin things and there's these paperwork and there's these diagrams.
2912100	2916500	And I investigated all of those, but you also said there's a chest in the corner.
2916500	2918260	And there's a wooden trunk.
2918260	2920020	Never, it never got brought up again.
2920020	2921940	I totally forgot to check into it.
2921940	2923940	There could have been something cool inside.
2924580	2928820	I wonder, I think that that was why I decided not to check it out is because I thought I
2928820	2933300	knew what it was, but to have not actually said, let's open that bad boy up.
2935460	2936260	It might've.
2936260	2938500	It was real frustrating to listen back to.
2938500	2942340	I think that's probably something that the listeners can relate to.
2945300	2945800	All right.
2947380	2950180	Justin, you have any theories about the woods?
2950180	2953620	Oh, they seem bad and like you shouldn't be there.
2953620	2954120	Nope.
2955780	2963140	And you shouldn't be putting your arm inside of a weird monster tree that desires flesh.
2963140	2966180	I was so glad that you did it like right away.
2966180	2967860	You just did it so quick.
2967860	2968900	I mean, it's funny.
2968900	2972500	It's funny looking back, but it was like you said a loop trap.
2974820	2977540	Almost as if what does this button do?
2977540	2978340	Oh boy.
2978340	2980740	Whatever happened to our naked raccoon friend?
2981380	2982020	Oh, right.
2982900	2985380	He's he's did he get killed at the end?
2985380	2987060	Did I, did I see him get killed?
2987060	2988980	How long do raccoons live for?
2990500	2991460	Uh, I'll Google it.
2995780	2996980	I'm going to say four years.
2998980	3004260	Two to three years, 28 inches, two to three years in the wild.
3007140	3009220	And 10 to 15 years old as a pet.
3009220	3009940	Oh wow.
3009940	3011780	We should be getting more raccoons as pets.
3012420	3014100	What if there's a human inside?
3015460	3016580	Uh, split the diff.
3018980	3020180	That's what Google says.
3020900	3022260	Human inside, not outside.
3023060	3024020	Human inside.
3024020	3024520	Yeah.
3025060	3028100	I accidentally Googled how long do raccoons.
3029140	3031140	How long do raccoons Zach?
3032020	3037460	So they, uh, Jay Hawk Inc asked any of the side story characters that could show up in
3037460	3043300	the main story or the inverse, like the boys getting to explore the calm, comfy campgrounds.
3044100	3050020	Uh, yeah, I, um, I made plans a while ago for the calm, comfy campgrounds in case you
3050020	3054820	guys wanted to go there as far as side stories showing up in the main story.
3054820	3056820	Um, it's all main story, baby.
3057380	3061140	I know like some of them are in the past, but this is all one big story.
3061140	3062900	That's all interconnected.
3062900	3065380	So it's all main story.
3065460	3070340	So they could all show up anywhere if they're still alive or if they're not, maybe, uh,
3070340	3075940	Jay Hawk Inc also says, I think I'm going to make one of my social distancing projects,
3075940	3078260	quote, re-listen and fill out the Wiki.
3079140	3081540	Hell yeah, but do it.
3082180	3083300	Good luck indeed.
3083300	3084900	But yeah, that would be sick.
3084900	3091540	Uh, I'll send you the overviews of the episodes if you want help with doing that.
3092260	3096660	And then, uh, they also said, and maybe pay more attention to the community.
3096660	3101300	I don't follow on Twitter for some reason, do it that pretending prod on Twitter and
3101300	3105140	didn't even know we had a discord until it was mentioned in the last episode.
3105140	3106020	How dare you?
3106020	3108180	How did I not know we had a discord?
3108180	3109780	How did you not know we had a discord?
3109780	3110980	We never talk about it.
3112900	3117220	I mean, we kind of mentioned it offhandedly, but I don't think we've, have we ever like
3117220	3118980	explicitly shouted it out on the show?
3119860	3120740	I don't know.
3122500	3126260	I think Wolf the dog does it fairly often.
3126260	3128820	And it's definitely not in any of the early episodes.
3128820	3129380	That is true.
3129380	3132500	But I'm afraid at this point because the discord is awesome.
3133220	3137860	And the more people join, the more likely for it to be not awesome anymore.
3137860	3138900	Oh, it's, it's easy.
3138900	3141380	You just ban them when they're dumb immediately.
3142740	3144420	Shout out to crush 36.
3144420	3146500	Shout out to pretending to be Justin.
3149780	3150660	Mod it up boys.
3151860	3152980	We got another question.
3152980	3154260	This one's a fun one.
3154260	3155780	Guys, lighten up.
3155780	3157540	You're taking this way too seriously.
3158580	3159940	This is a fun one.
3159940	3166180	Crane song asks, let's suppose the boys parentheses, including Drew and Maggie and whoever
3166180	3172420	Zach decides is covered by quote, the boys were put under quarantine like we are today.
3172420	3177140	Assuming that for some reason, contention PD is not considered an essential service,
3178100	3178740	which I love.
3179860	3184100	How do you, how do they, how do they spend their isolation or would they ignore?
3184740	3186660	Oh, don't give that option to them.
3186660	3189860	Would they ignore a statewide stay at home order?
3190900	3191380	That's unfortunate.
3191380	3192580	We know the answer.
3192580	3192820	Yeah.
3192820	3195140	But unfortunately, you know, John Lee Pennymore would.
3195140	3199300	I know the first thing that would come out of your mouth is that John Lee Pennymore wouldn't
3199300	3200580	give a fuck.
3200580	3202660	Well, he would like, Oh my God.
3202660	3203540	Such an idiot.
3203540	3204100	I know.
3204180	3209460	And there's this dude I know on Facebook, the shit he's posted about COVID is like,
3209460	3213380	definitely what the kind of media like John Lee Pennymore would consume.
3213380	3219300	Oh, like baseless theories about how it's like trying to control us as a population.
3219300	3221780	Like, yeah, like 5g conspiracy theory shit.
3221780	3222740	Oh yeah.
3222740	3223860	So just like true stuff.
3225220	3228500	Yeah, the straight shit.
3230260	3231940	Honestly, he might take it seriously.
3232100	3237540	Uh, he might be that kind of like prepper conspiracy theorist who's like, kind of been
3237540	3240820	waiting for this, but he also just has like a lot of land.
3240820	3246580	So he's probably out there just like shooting guns all day and riding around on like a four
3246580	3249860	Wheeler and watching his DVDs.
3249860	3254900	Any existential crisis inside John Lee Pennymore about enjoying the quarantine?
3255620	3258900	No, I don't think John Lee Pennymore ever sweats having a good time.
3259780	3261780	Why are you going to feel guilty about living your life, baby?
3264980	3266820	Not much would change for Clark.
3266820	3269780	He just wouldn't be going to work, but he'd still be at home.
3269780	3275540	Uh, maybe he'd break out his old jigsaw puzzles and, uh, he might, uh, he might teach
3275540	3278340	himself how to cook, not a TV dinner.
3279220	3281700	He might learn to boil an egg.
3283700	3285300	I have 40 boiled eggs.
3285860	3288500	He gets a chef's hat with one notch in it.
3291780	3292740	What about Keith Vigna?
3293540	3300180	Uh, Keith gets a side job delivering newspapers in his cruiser and then continues to cruise
3300180	3305540	around the city the whole day, basically ignoring that he's not essential and just to have some
3305540	3306660	sort of authority.
3308100	3310100	That's worse than John's.
3310580	3312900	Oh, that's worse than John's.
3315220	3317300	Yeah, except for the Facebook share.
3318740	3323300	Like I harass people in the parking lot of the grocery store.
3324900	3328900	You're just hanging out at the first church of contention every Sunday and Wednesday,
3328900	3330100	handing out tickets.
3330100	3331540	Yeah, exactly.
3331540	3336420	I think Wolf the dog would seize as much power as he possibly could since he knows everyone's
3336420	3338580	stuck at home listening to him constantly.
3339300	3340180	It's like Mitch McConnell.
3340900	3346740	You could also just like maybe fuck off to like another time until things get like, I'm
3346740	3348420	going to where the garbage is.
3351940	3353700	People have been very conscious of their garbage.
3353700	3354580	What would Drew be doing?
3354580	3357460	Would he be working on his, uh, his YouTube channel?
3358980	3363140	I think Drew would honestly, uh, get really upset.
3363140	3364340	He lives alone.
3364340	3367940	So he would get really, really lonely.
3367940	3375540	And every day that went by without a zoom call, uh, or even the request for, uh, any
3375540	3381380	sort of friendship would lead him to slowly stop enjoying the things that he previously
3381380	3383460	liked, like playing Minecraft.
3384820	3388340	For his millions of YouTube subscribers.
3388340	3392580	Shit does that, I just remembered that Drew and John are millionaires.
3395380	3398180	John would be much more of a problem.
3398180	3405380	He would have been down at his ass off and like Pensacola.
3408500	3410580	Just being a problem.
3412100	3417700	And Drew, I would assume is like maybe having a good time ordering himself everything he
3417700	3418820	ever wanted from Amazon.
3419460	3427620	I think, uh, he is just waiting that extra week and trying to avoid articles about any
3427620	3433860	sort of worker strikes, uh, in order to feel fine about ordering from Amazon.
3433860	3444580	And meanwhile, he's just got like maps of different cities up on his wall and stats,
3444660	3451140	uh, for how many potential youths lives can be changed with the money that he's bringing
3451140	3456020	in for each city, uh, trying to decide where he can do the most good.
3456020	3456740	Wow.
3456740	3457860	And a boy.
3457860	3458580	Good job, Drew.
3460580	3462100	He only has $5 million.
3464820	3472020	He's got a $10,000 Mike, uh, Minecraft computer and all the cool ASMR stuff you could imagine.
3472740	3474420	So much bubble wrap.
3478660	3480020	All the bubble wrap.
3480020	3483540	The only music Drew listens to is ASMR Youtubers.
3484820	3485620	And bubble wrap.
3486340	3487060	Bubble wrap.
3488900	3492100	Oh, you guys, this is a really good bubble wrap compilation.
3492100	3495620	Bubble wrap would be a great name for like a kid's hip hop album.
3495620	3496820	Oh yeah.
3496820	3501380	It works at least in three ways that I can think of.
3501380	3504580	Bubble wrap sounds like a Kiro Kiro Benito album.
3504580	3506340	Oh, Oh, Thomas.
3506340	3507460	We got a speed round.
3507460	3516020	We got to hit when Thomas gets back speed round round.
3516020	3520180	They're all about me and the things that I am going to say.
3520180	3525460	So I want you guys to ask me these questions as fast as you can.
3526340	3530900	And don't decide who goes first or who goes next, but please go as fast as you can.
3531140	3536420	BazingaBegins asks, who are the four skeleton boys on the PTP logo supposed to be?
3536420	3538420	Do they have one-to-one analogs in the story?
3538420	3540100	Which came first, the story or the logo?
3540100	3545220	It is Luke, a cowboy, an FBI MIB type agent.
3545220	3546660	And, oh, fuck.
3546660	3547460	What's the last one?
3547460	3548180	I'm blanking.
3548180	3549620	I'm blanking so hard.
3549620	3550180	A cop.
3550180	3552260	It's a cop with a mustache.
3552260	3554580	A one-to-one analogs in the story.
3554580	3555080	No.
3555860	3557460	Which came first, the story or the logo?
3557460	3558180	The story.
3558180	3563540	But the logo, while not one-to-one analogs is definitely, I chose them for a reason based
3563540	3564740	on the whole story that we're telling.
3564740	3565540	So get ready.
3565540	3566660	Jayhawk Inc.
3566660	3568820	Just how big is contention?
3568820	3572580	Like there was a school bus full of homeless people, but I'm not sure where they all came
3572580	3572980	from.
3572980	3575300	How many people work at Contingent PD?
3575300	3578740	5,000 people live in contention or slightly fewer.
3578740	3583140	And four people, five people work at Contingent PD.
3583140	3584180	No, six.
3584180	3589460	The three of you, Drew, Maggie, and Ray, Ari, Tim, Florence.
3590180	3596340	BxBori9181 asks, I feel like clothes in certain situations are very important.
3596340	3598260	Am I imagining that or is it so?
3598260	3599460	It is very important.
3600260	3604100	It's an audio medium where I have to describe people and then you have to remember them
3604100	3604660	for later.
3604660	3608500	So I have to keep the same descriptions of either what they're wearing or what they look
3608500	3612500	like every time they pop back up or most of the time when they pop back up, depending
3612500	3614260	on how subtle I'm trying to be.
3614260	3614980	Nice.
3614980	3620500	BazingaBegins asks, after season one wraps, will Zach be posting full lore notes slash
3620500	3621300	background?
3621300	3624420	Any chance of turning this into an official module for Delta Green?
3624420	3628820	Turning this into an official module for Delta Green would take as much time as writing a
3628820	3631940	book and I'm willing to put it in if we can make it happen.
3631940	3637380	But our Patreon would have to be at a higher level and we'd also have to get Delta Green
3637380	3638660	behind us to publish it.
3638740	3642900	But if they don't want to publish it and the money's there, I will definitely spend the
3642900	3647780	time to write this thing out into a full book and get illustrators and do maps for every
3647780	3651380	building and everything and it would be fucking awesome and I would love to do that.
3651940	3652980	Jayhawk Inc.
3652980	3658980	How many clues did the group miss or misinterpret before the ding was edited in after correct
3658980	3659620	guesses?
3659620	3664260	Clues have been missed and misinterpreted constantly from the beginning and that's how
3664260	3667780	role-playing works constantly and that's what makes it so much fun.
3667780	3672500	The ding was only in like one or two episodes and it was for fun.
3672500	3676500	LordDary asks, have you guys ever thought about a collaboration with Last Podcast on
3676500	3677060	the left?
3677060	3678580	I dream about it every night.
3678580	3680420	I love Last Podcast on the left.
3680420	3683540	Everyone should tweet at Last Podcast on the left and be like, hey, you guys don't have
3683540	3686340	a role-playing podcast on the Last Podcast network.
3686340	3687380	Maybe you should have one.
3688420	3689620	And then mention us.
3689620	3690820	Don't forget about that part.
3690820	3692820	Yeah, that would be, yes, thank you, Luke, please.
3692820	3693460	Next.
3693460	3697620	Bazinga Begin says, how long did you think it would take the boys to play through the
3697620	3698740	campaign, i.e.
3699300	3701540	how many episodes did you think season one would be?
3701540	3705140	What's the most important detail that got added after your initial plans?
3705140	3707700	40 episodes tops, whole thing.
3707700	3710020	I was like, easy, done, for sure.
3710740	3714260	What's the most, and it'll probably be 100 is my guess currently.
3714260	3717620	What's the most important detail that got added after, all of them, all of them got
3717620	3719540	it added after the initial plans.
3719540	3724420	What I planned was just background and the first like two episodes.
3724420	3729860	Jayhawk Inc, is there a list of loose threads or abandoned or unresolved elements?
3729860	3730180	Yes.
3731940	3736980	OkayNothing4 asks, what happened to the gun, helmet, radio, etc?
3736980	3738900	They just vanished from the story?
3738900	3742180	They vanished from the story because the players aren't where they are.
3742180	3748900	The radio and the helmet are in the contention evidence locker and the gun and the camera
3748900	3751220	are in Marvin Glass's compound.
3751220	3756020	Jayhawk Inc asks, has anything been forgotten by accident that might have changed the story
3756020	3757940	if it had been remembered at the time?
3759620	3762980	Yes, 100%, absolutely, constantly.
3762980	3764980	I think that's the story of the podcast.
3766020	3768660	If you remember something, it becomes more important.
3769620	3770740	Thomas, read that last one.
3772180	3772660	Hold on.
3774900	3776820	It's a speed round, come on.
3776820	3777940	Bazinga begins.
3777940	3779460	On page what counts as a story?
3780420	3781060	Speed round.
3781620	3783700	Sorry, when you said last one, I went to the last one.
3783700	3784820	We got to keep saying speed round.
3784820	3785540	Speed round.
3786900	3788500	All right, Bazinga begins.
3788500	3790740	What counts as a story arc on the show?
3790740	3795380	The past two episodes mentioned that season one has three more story arcs left.
3795380	3799220	How many have there been so far in your opinion and where are the breaks roughly?
3799220	3803220	You read that so well and I really appreciated you doing that.
3803220	3806660	Like your cadence was perfect and your voice-
3806660	3807620	Speed round.
3807620	3810580	Can you read it as fast as you can?
3810580	3811380	I'm just curious.
3811380	3812260	I think it'd be fun.
3812260	3813140	Bazinga begins.
3813140	3814420	What counts as a story arc on the show?
3814420	3816660	The past two episodes mentioned that season one has three more story arcs left.
3816660	3818740	How many have there been so far in your opinion and where are the breaks roughly?
3818740	3819860	That was amazing.
3819860	3821300	That was so impressive.
3821300	3826340	Should we all, at the same time, all at the same time as fast as we can?
3826340	3827140	Three.
3827140	3827700	Count us down.
3827700	3829540	Three, two, one.
3829540	3831380	What counts as a story arc on the show?
3831380	3834340	The past two episodes mentioned that season one has three more arcs left.
3834340	3837140	How many have there been so far in your opinion and where are the breaks roughly?
3838820	3839540	Nice.
3839540	3840660	I fumbled a few words.
3842180	3844420	It was kind of weird hearing it all at the same time.
3844420	3846020	It was like a speech jammer.
3846020	3847780	Everyone answered at the same time.
3847780	3850740	No, so there have been seven arcs so far.
3850740	3851540	There are three left.
3851540	3852580	That'll be 10 total.
3852580	3857140	Episodes one through 14 was the start to the FBI agents leaving contention.
3857140	3859860	Episodes 15 to 25 is the next arc.
3859860	3864180	Flashbacks of their past to the officers leaving contention.
3864180	3871380	Episodes 26 through 35 is them going to the city to chanting inside Ari Manstein's mausoleum,
3871380	3874260	which is where we've, you know, the end of where we've reset to.
3874260	3878100	And then 37 to 46 was the glass compound in Planet Juggernaut.
3878100	3880660	47 to 53 was the woods in the past.
3880660	3884180	54 to 64 was the numbers in City State University.
3884180	3888900	And 66 to 72 is calm comfy campground, also in the past.
3888900	3891620	That is the end of that.
3891620	3892100	Yes.
3892100	3896340	And then bonus arc is eight Q&A episodes.
3898100	3901460	Yeah, and we have Maladory asks, what is your favorite type of plot?
3901460	3905620	I am personally a big fan of scatter, but I can't fault anyone who enjoys a good box plot.
3905620	3906980	I'm a graph kind of guy.
3906980	3908100	I like a probability plot.
3908100	3909460	I like a good one.
3909460	3910500	I like pie.
3910500	3912820	I like when the plot thickens.
3912820	3916260	Damn Guardian asks, are we going to see Drew again?
3916260	3917860	Everyone answer on the count of three.
3917860	3918580	One, two, three.
3918580	3919460	Absolutely.
3919460	3920820	Hell yeah.
3920820	3922020	Yeah, no doubt for sure.
3922740	3924500	That is the end of the speed round.
3926820	3928740	I didn't know that's where that speed round ended.
3929300	3931540	I think we nailed it so fast.
3931540	3934420	I can't wait to listen to us all ask the question at the same time.
3934420	3935860	It's my favorite part of the episode.
3936820	3941940	Uh, so we've got a question here from Maladory asks with contention being abandoned or emptied
3941940	3946180	recently and the town having turned against the CPD because of the non-denomination specific
3946180	3950500	pastor, is anyone there left around or is it mostly just the people in the city?
3950500	3955620	Did anyone actually make it out or was everyone gobbled up by the old goo monster?
3955620	3958740	Curious as to what your guys's thoughts are on the matter.
3958740	3964020	Is he actually non-denominational or is he, uh, like Pentecostal or a Baptist?
3964100	3968740	He is non-denominational, but not the denomination of non-denom.
3968740	3971220	Just he doesn't have a denomination.
3971220	3974180	First church of contention, pastor Adam Kane.
3974180	3978100	I think that we can answer that when we go back.
3978100	3982260	Yeah, that's, that's what I wrote in my little notes here is that we don't know for sure.
3982900	3987460	I think Drew has told us that it seems dead around the city or around contention.
3987460	3993940	I have a feeling that we will arrive, uh, to a nightmare scenario, but that's just my guess.
3994580	3996980	Or everything's fine, probably.
3998660	4000660	Everything's just completely back to normal.
4000660	4002260	Which would be almost even scarier.
4002260	4003220	If we've done our jobs right.
4003220	4008020	In the last numbers arc, the city university arc, did we, we tried to call Drew a few times,
4008020	4010100	didn't we? And it just kept going to voicemail?
4010100	4010580	Yeah.
4010580	4011060	Okay.
4011060	4014660	So go, going back to that last question, probably not then.
4017780	4022740	Okay, nothing for, how have the decisions made affected the trust held between the
4022820	4025220	three contention PD officers?
4025220	4028820	How did it affect you when you found out that I killed my brother?
4028820	4029780	It wasn't great.
4032500	4036740	I, uh, I feel like Clark still has a level of trust for you guys though.
4036740	4041060	Just because we've gone, we started at zero and we've gone through so much crazy shit together
4041060	4045860	that like, I'm a little more understanding about you doing fucked up shit in this world now.
4046660	4050260	I think possibly it has raised the trust level.
4050260	4051860	Probably for Keith it has.
4051940	4057700	Yeah, definitely like I've seen Keith handle himself in these situations now.
4057700	4062500	And so I don't think it, I don't think he was surprised to learn about Keith killing his brother.
4064980	4066180	That tracks, that tracks.
4066180	4066340	Yeah.
4067460	4071540	But I think I definitely find Keith more capable than I might've at the start of the series.
4071540	4075540	I think Keith has gotten more capable as time goes.
4077220	4081060	It's been hours since I've been a truly pathetic police officer.
4081860	4085940	Crane song asks players.
4085940	4091220	Are there any in character secrets that you suspect the other players are keeping from you?
4091220	4096020	Any theories about the other characters that you aren't sure of, but you're willing to share?
4096580	4099620	So don't answer that one right now.
4099620	4101060	I don't know.
4101060	4101540	Can you hear me?
4101540	4102020	Don't do it.
4102660	4102900	Yeah.
4104740	4106420	Pretend you can't answer it.
4106420	4112020	Uh, so I'm going to break you guys off as soon as this quarantine's over.
4112020	4114740	I'm just going to break you guys.
4114740	4115380	Bring it, bitch.
4115380	4117060	Break a piece off of you, Joe.
4119620	4121140	Hey, okay.
4121140	4122900	I'd like to see you try.
4123460	4126260	Break me off a piece of that Joe Terry.
4127780	4128580	Come on, get a snack.
4129460	4138340	So, uh, so yeah, be thinking about, uh, whether or not you have any theories on the other
4138340	4141620	characters while, uh, who's going to pee first.
4141620	4142660	I have to pee.
4142660	4144900	Want to see all the bubblies I've drank so far?
4144900	4147540	One, two.
4148740	4149380	Oh my God.
4150100	4150420	No way.
4150420	4150660	Three.
4152340	4153220	No, you're not going to pull.
4153220	4153620	Four.
4153620	4153940	Four?
4155300	4155780	You're out of control.
4155780	4159220	And then two, two in the trashcan that I've thrown away.
4159220	4160900	And this is the one I'm drinking right now.
4160900	4163220	That's an expensive habit you're picking up there.
4164740	4166900	Well, I'm in my parents' house, so they're buying it.
4166900	4168900	Those are the three Coke Zero I drank.
4169780	4171300	Oh, wowzers.
4171940	4174740	I had two cold brews and I am sweaty.
4174740	4178420	I had a small water bottle and now I'm working on a big water bottle.
4179140	4180180	Fuck off.
4180180	4183060	Shut the fuck up, Joe.
4183060	4186420	Oh, I added, uh, I added Emergen-C to the small water bottle.
4186420	4186900	Oh, nice.
4186900	4188820	I've been drinking a lot of that too.
4188820	4193220	I haven't drank alcohol this whole quarantine, so I've been replacing it with bubbly and
4193220	4194180	Pocky sticks.
4194180	4195300	Nice combo, man.
4195300	4197860	Yeah, it makes me have to pee and poop all the time though.
4197860	4198340	So, bye.
4202500	4203860	All right, I'm going to sing.
4203860	4205220	Should I take my headphones off?
4205220	4207540	Cause I can hear what you guys say in the bathroom.
4207540	4211860	You shouldn't have told us that and you should have just popped up like a cool bathroom guest.
4213060	4215060	All right.
4215860	4222180	I am going to send Thomas off to the waiting room and I'll bring you back in shortly.
4222180	4222820	Bye.
4222820	4223060	Bye.
4223940	4225140	Oh, that's fun.
4225140	4225460	Hi.
4225460	4230740	Oh, zoom is so much easier than having the, like you guys in the living room, like screaming
4230740	4233140	at each other because we're all the loudest people ever.
4233140	4237220	I hope that they remember to keep their recordings going and that you get to hear what we talk
4237220	4239700	about when we're in the living room.
4241060	4241860	Oh yeah.
4241860	4242820	I didn't think about that.
4243300	4245780	Wait, can you guys see each other when you're in the waiting room?
4245780	4248500	They can't hear you, nor can I tell you the answer to that.
4250580	4252820	Do you want to put me in the waiting room and then bring me back?
4253780	4254900	He's gone.
4254900	4255380	Oh no.
4256180	4256900	All right.
4256900	4257780	Let's bring him back.
4259380	4260980	We sent a scout into the portal.
4260980	4261700	Oh God.
4261700	4264340	No, it was just a blank screen.
4264340	4266340	There's nothing on the other side.
4266340	4266980	Oh God.
4268100	4270580	That's almost worse than what I was expecting.
4270580	4272420	I've seen the waiting room.
4272500	4275220	Somebody Thomas changed his name to mommy.
4275940	4280100	Hey, that's fun.
4280900	4281540	I like that.
4282500	4283140	Okay.
4283140	4283780	What's up, Joe?
4285540	4287060	You're the only one who's here.
4287060	4288660	I've got a question for you.
4289780	4291300	Justin is also here.
4291300	4292740	Got a question for you.
4293700	4295940	It's Hey, who is Angela Fairfield?
4297220	4301380	So it turned out I believe it was Annie or Ann.
4301380	4305060	It was, uh, the woman that killed Clark's parents.
4305700	4308740	And I kind of wish I would have, it would have dawned on me at the time in
4308740	4313380	role-playing, but the little girl who I think we're assuming is Maggie now came
4313380	4317780	running up the sidewalk and was like, and, and good to see you.
4318340	4324660	And I think I failed a human role to see how Ann reacted to that and how James
4324660	4325380	reacted.
4325380	4325620	Yeah.
4326420	4330660	But yeah, it, after the fact, I, it kind of, it, uh, it all, it all came around
4330660	4331460	full circle too.
4331460	4336980	Oh, I remember you realizing after we'd stopped recording and you were like,
4336980	4337620	what?
4337620	4338580	Zach, you motherfucker!
4338580	4341700	Like you like really, and I, I never...
4341700	4348500	To have made Joe married to the character that killed his other character's
4348500	4350660	parents was a really weird mind fuck.
4352500	4352740	Yeah.
4354980	4355700	Thank you.
4355700	4356980	Yeah, you nailed it.
4358180	4360020	Also renamed the parents.
4360020	4362740	Yeah, Jerry and Eunice.
4364260	4364740	Love that.
4366740	4371540	I wrote down in my notes here that I wanted to remind the audience that Clark
4371540	4377860	actually saw Ann in the circle of knowledge room when he very first was
4377860	4378420	brought there.
4379620	4382740	He saw a glimpse of her as a door shut closed.
4383460	4386740	So another reason I should have picked up on the fact that she was running in
4386740	4388420	the circle of knowledge crew.
4388900	4394420	Probably you would have expected her to still be in jail, likely, based on you
4394420	4397940	being at her hearing and her pulling a double homicide.
4398580	4400180	And admitting to it on the stand.
4400180	4401940	She said, I did it and I do it again.
4403300	4408740	One might've assumed that she would not be free to go wherever she pleased.
4409780	4413860	But there's also a timey-wimey fucky thing going on with Clark's memories too.
4413860	4416660	So, I mean, there's a little bit of like, did that happen?
4416660	4417460	Did that not happen?
4417620	4418420	Did that not happen?
4418420	4418580	Yeah.
4418580	4420420	It's real, it's real, real wild for him.
4420420	4425860	I think if we're this deep in the game and you're not questioning reality, then
4425860	4427540	you're not paying attention.
4428260	4433940	Bazinga begins asked, so Clark and Maggie, is Clark in love with her or what?
4435220	4439300	Maybe in like an Oedipal way, but I think it's way more of an authority
4439300	4443540	figure that he respects and wants the approval of.
4444100	4445460	I think he's got hots for teacher.
4446100	4446740	Yeah, there you go.
4446740	4452660	Maybe that, but it's, it's not surface level romance for sure.
4453300	4457380	Maladory asks, are we going to see more about Clark's parents?
4457380	4461620	What info can you give us that we know about them, but might not have stuck in?
4462420	4464820	All the best letters got me emotionally.
4464820	4467460	And I hope Clark finds some closure there.
4467460	4472580	So early on, we mentioned that we gave Zach the free reign to do whatever he wants to
4472580	4474420	our characters' backstories.
4474420	4476420	And he's done exactly that with the parent stuff.
4477220	4479780	That was never written into my character description.
4480420	4484980	So I'm learning and absorbing as much as the audience is when all that stuff comes up.
4485780	4489060	So as far as stuff that stuck out to us that we, or maybe that hasn't stuck out to
4489060	4492020	us that needed to have stuck out to us, I hope I didn't miss any of that.
4493460	4494900	But I'm loving it.
4494900	4499300	I think it's, you were already given the best letters is a really fucking ominous
4499300	4503620	and cool hook that I'm, I really want to explore so much more.
4503620	4506260	Yeah, I feel like it's, but yeah, I'm right there with you.
4506260	4510900	I feel like it's adding a really interesting wrinkle to Clark's weird character.
4511540	4512100	Totally.
4512100	4513700	I'm loving playing it too.
4513700	4514260	Yeah.
4514260	4518500	When we found old Clark's hidey hole and we found that tape of his parents playing on
4518500	4521620	Wheel of Fortune, that was a really cool just moment.
4521620	4523060	Like what the fuck's going on?
4523060	4523560	Yeah.
4524020	4525060	I have a question.
4525060	4527620	Why do you, other than, nevermind.
4528580	4530420	So let's see.
4531780	4535860	Clark's parents were seen in the flashback, obviously.
4536580	4540500	We've got the picture as well.
4540500	4542020	Oh yeah, fuck.
4542020	4542740	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4542740	4543620	Jim Cook's house.
4544260	4545940	Jim Cook was friends with my parents.
4545940	4546900	I forgot about that.
4547540	4549380	It's just a picture of them with Jim, right?
4549380	4549620	Yep.
4549620	4551380	And they're all like smiley.
4551380	4554020	I think your parents were smiling and Jim Cook was like.
4554020	4555460	Yeah, he was stern.
4555460	4556260	Audio medium.
4558260	4560260	He was stoic.
4560260	4560660	It's weird.
4560660	4565620	I have more trouble with that now that we're on Zoom than I ever did when we were literally
4565620	4566260	face to face.
4567940	4569060	I don't know.
4569060	4575060	And then we've got them being at the circle of, yeah, sure.
4575060	4578740	At the circle of knowledge's calm, comfy campground, right?
4578740	4586340	So curious as to like metagaming, what your thoughts were when you found out that your
4586420	4589700	parents had been to comfy campground.
4589700	4592740	You were freaking me out that you were trying to imply that Anne was my mom.
4592740	4595940	Now I remember that we saw the names on the tapes.
4597060	4597700	Eunice would never.
4597700	4598980	I was like, what the fuck?
4599540	4604820	Yeah, no, seeing Eunice and Jerry, I mean, so yeah, it's metagame wise, it's all coming
4604820	4607700	together that they had something to do with the circle of knowledge.
4607700	4612180	They were, or actually maybe not the circle of knowledge, the tapes were people who had
4612180	4613780	participated on the island.
4613780	4617220	So maybe the circle of knowledge needed something from them.
4617220	4618260	Yeah, that's what it is.
4618260	4621300	They needed something from Clark's parents.
4621300	4622260	Holy shit.
4622260	4624260	I didn't put that together until just now.
4624260	4625940	That's super fucking dope.
4625940	4630100	It's, I have a few theories already now what they might've got.
4630740	4633460	Oh, that made me really happy watching your face change.
4634660	4635460	That's dope.
4636020	4636740	That was cool.
4638980	4639380	Yeah.
4639380	4640580	All right, let's move on.
4640740	4645620	Bazinga begins asks, what happened to Clark's heart?
4646180	4647380	It got poked out.
4647380	4647700	Next.
4650660	4651540	Very succinct.
4652420	4652740	Okay.
4655700	4658740	I think maybe what they were actually going for is where did we leave it?
4658740	4661060	And I don't remember exactly.
4661060	4665860	I was showing Maggie and she pulled the rod out in front of me and like reassure me that
4665860	4666580	I would be okay.
4667300	4668980	And I think we just went to the next scene.
4668980	4669940	I think I left it there.
4671460	4671780	Yeah.
4671780	4672820	Clark didn't take it with him.
4672820	4674900	So it is at them.
4674900	4679140	Is it in like a little cooler assume and it says Clark's bag of ice.
4679140	4681620	I'm hoping that they don't touch Clark's.
4682260	4684100	I popped it into the freezer.
4685620	4685940	Okay.
4685940	4690820	Nothing for asked how many versions of Clark Bishop have there been so far?
4690820	4691540	Oh, I'm curious.
4691540	4692420	Did you look this up?
4692980	4694020	I did it from memory.
4694900	4697140	But I don't know the, I don't know totally.
4697140	4697380	Okay.
4697380	4701940	So I'll tell you the instances that we've seen other Clarks, uh, one ran into the police
4701940	4704500	department and told Drew not to go to Maggie's house.
4705300	4709220	There was one that was running across a field while I was standing in my kitchen.
4709220	4712420	And it was right when the circle of knowledge first abducted me.
4712420	4716500	Like I saw him running toward me and realized it was, it was a Clark.
4717140	4720100	And then I blacked out and woke up in the circle of knowledge.
4720100	4723220	And then we've just got the old Clark's fuckery.
4723220	4725460	He's in a robe and doing symbols and shit.
4726340	4731220	I don't know how to categorize that if that's like a bunch of different Clark bishops, or
4731220	4736500	if it's the same Clark bishops at different points in his life, coming back to touch my
4736500	4737540	Clark's life.
4738180	4739460	I don't know how to differentiate.
4739460	4745220	So I, yeah, so that's the, those are the instances of different Clarks, unless I'm forgetting
4745220	4745460	one.
4745460	4747380	Do you remember if there was another Zach?
4747380	4748100	No idea, man.
4748580	4754180	Uh, that'll do it for the, wait, I want to answer the, uh, lead in.
4754180	4755220	Oh yeah.
4755940	4757700	Crane song asked players.
4757700	4761460	Are there any in character secrets that you suspect the other players are keeping from
4761460	4765220	you or any theories about other characters you're not sure of, but you're willing to
4765220	4765620	share?
4765620	4771460	So the only thing that I think is maybe being, maybe purposefully kept from me, but I don't
4771460	4776340	know if it's that, or if it's just Thomas not remembering, but I feel like he saw files
4776900	4778660	that had a lot to do with all of us.
4779220	4784420	And he told me like he saw an in one of the files and love.
4785220	4789780	I just don't know if he was being cagey with me because he, there was more in the file
4789780	4794020	that he didn't want to share with me or if he was just not remembering it all.
4794020	4797700	I feel like that is an interesting thing that Clark would like to know more about all the
4797700	4798980	files that Thomas saw.
4798980	4803940	And then also everything that happened to John Lee Pettymore is a little bit fuzzy as
4803940	4805380	far as truth or not truth.
4806340	4810500	But I, again, I don't know for sure if it's purposeful or not, but yeah, I think that's
4810500	4810980	fair.
4810980	4815300	And those are the big ones that I'm, I'm curious about anything, theories about other
4815300	4817380	characters that you aren't sure of, but you're willing to share.
4818020	4820740	Clark is really fucking conflicted about Maggie.
4820740	4827140	I feel like he, there's a lot of signs pointing to her being shady, but she showed him the
4827140	4829380	fucking scary thing that scared the wits out of him.
4829380	4832260	So he just knows that he needs to make that not a thing.
4833220	4838580	But like we found that note that was maybe her dad saying that Maggie, like he had underlined
4838580	4843060	and over-lined words to like maybe cast aspersions on Maggie.
4843060	4846580	And you found that in the secret room at Jim Cook's house.
4846580	4851140	That that we're, we're rolling with the theory that it was maybe where old Clark was living.
4851140	4852900	So I just, yeah, I don't know.
4852900	4854180	Clark is super conflicted.
4854180	4857540	Joe is super conflicted about where to stand with Maggie.
4857540	4857780	Yeah.
4858340	4861620	Again, he's, she's somebody that he would trust implicitly though.
4861700	4865380	So he's, he's going to go along with it until something smacks him over the head.
4865380	4865780	I think.
4866980	4867700	Yeah.
4867700	4868740	Thank you, Joe.
4868740	4869240	Thank you.
4870660	4872660	I love having you as a player.
4872660	4874260	I love playing with you.
4874260	4874980	You're my favorite.
4877780	4879540	I'm going to, I'm going to go, I'm going to go tell them.
4879540	4881220	And let's get Joe the fuck out of here.
4881220	4882740	Get the fuck out of here, Joe.
4884500	4888020	I'm glad you lied to him about being your favorite.
4888020	4888900	He, he needed it.
4889700	4892340	He, I mean, he has to have it.
4892340	4896180	He just like, Oh man.
4896180	4899460	Obviously, obviously player.
4900660	4900980	Let's see.
4900980	4903060	I'm pulling Thomas up right now.
4903060	4903940	Let's see if he's here.
4903940	4904500	There he is.
4908980	4909480	Hi.
4911060	4913220	I got one question for you, baby.
4913220	4913940	Yeah.
4913940	4915380	Where the money at?
4915380	4915860	Oh man.
4915860	4916500	I wish I knew.
4917220	4919060	Not in podcasting.
4921780	4922020	Yeah.
4922020	4923460	If anybody finds out, let me know.
4923460	4929940	Do you know where the money that you made from the drug deal as John Lee
4929940	4932980	Pettymore is currently?
4932980	4933460	Yeah.
4933460	4936580	John, John knows he's not going to tell anyone.
4937220	4938500	I'm cool with that actually.
4938500	4938900	Yeah.
4938900	4941380	Oh, I mean, you're going to bullshit your way out of it.
4942100	4947620	That works for me because I looked it up and we never talked about where you hid
4947620	4949700	the money before you passed out drunk.
4949700	4953860	So I would assume that you hid the money somewhere.
4953860	4954580	That's the answer.
4954580	4955860	John doesn't quite know.
4959380	4960100	It's perfect.
4964020	4964820	Oh my God.
4964820	4969300	I keep saying that there's only three arcs left, but I keep thinking like you
4969300	4974340	literally, you brought this idea to me how long ago, months ago you were like,
4974340	4975940	there should be a Pettymore.
4976660	4978500	Everybody plays Pettymore's.
4978500	4978820	Yeah.
4978820	4980980	That it's like 25 years in the future.
4981700	4983380	An old man Pettymore's property.
4984500	4987380	You're trying to find the old John Lee Pettymore money.
4989300	4991540	And then Drew also had $5 million.
4992260	4995620	However, it was taken from Drew by Rosemary.
4995620	4997380	But then John took it back from her.
4997380	5004100	And so it is in the evidence locker along with the helmet and the radio.
5005220	5012100	Do you have any suspicions that you're being lied to by either of your fellow PCs?
5012740	5013860	Yeah, probably Joe.
5018180	5024100	I don't think we're getting the straight dope on the COK.
5024100	5024900	The what?
5024900	5026100	The circle of knowledge.
5026660	5028820	Oh, the COK.
5032260	5036260	I really honestly am shook that we've never called it that before.
5036260	5040260	Any theories or do you think Luke's being straight with you about what Keith Figna's up to?
5040260	5045220	I think Luke's been almost perfectly straight with us about what Keith Figna's been up to.
5046580	5048420	If he's pulled any punches then...
5052020	5052980	That's a good strategy.
5053780	5056020	Yeah, like, oh, I murdered my brother.
5056020	5060980	Like, be upfront about that so you can hide a smaller betrayal.
5064660	5068500	That makes me nervous about being your friend.
5068500	5070100	That's a really good strategy.
5070100	5071380	It's Keith's strategy.
5071940	5074500	Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.
5076340	5082500	Any other thoughts before your time to go back into the void of the waiting room is your reality?
5083620	5085220	Yeah, just namaste.
5085220	5085940	Oh, thanks, bud.
5085940	5086500	Thanks, dude.
5086500	5087140	I love you.
5087140	5087620	Love that.
5089060	5092900	God, I just, I think that's so cool of you.
5097860	5099300	Get the fuck out of here.
5099300	5100340	Randy's gone.
5102980	5104020	All right, let's bring in...
5104980	5107220	Oh, fuck, I actually used his real name.
5107220	5109700	We've been using fake names on the podcast this whole time.
5109700	5110200	Oh, shit.
5110200	5111800	Uh, hey...
5114760	5116440	I accidentally said your real name.
5116440	5117480	Doesn't have headphones.
5118680	5120040	He doesn't have his headphones in.
5120680	5122600	So I totally doxed you and...
5122600	5123960	Is his microphone even on?
5126040	5126540	Hey.
5126600	5127100	Hi.
5127720	5128920	Uh, hey, Luke.
5128920	5129480	Sup, sup.
5129480	5131400	Uh, what do you think about the watch?
5131400	5132200	The watch?
5132200	5133080	Yeah, the watch.
5133080	5134120	Oh, the watch.
5136600	5138440	Shit, I don't really know.
5138440	5141560	I think it's something to look into.
5144440	5146280	Yeah, I remember I saw...
5147000	5149240	I was, like, digging through the ground and I saw...
5150120	5151160	What did it say?
5151160	5152920	Like, it was at Beans Pond.
5152920	5153880	Is that right?
5153880	5158040	You did see Beans Pond in your weird, like...
5158040	5159160	Like a vision?
5159160	5163320	When you put on the watch, it felt like your consciousness was changing the channel
5163320	5165560	and you began to phase out of your reality
5166120	5168920	and then you seemed to be somewhere else entirely.
5168920	5172360	You felt wet grass and dirt on your fingers
5172360	5175240	and you were looking at a door in the ground
5175240	5177960	like a sealed metal door that was mostly buried
5177960	5180840	and on the door was an inscription that said
5188360	5192280	So it's my parents' tomb or something?
5192360	5195960	And then I did see that that was at Beans Pond?
5195960	5198440	Or is that a different part of the vision?
5198440	5203480	I think you just saw Beans Pond, like, in that vision?
5203480	5206680	Because you brought it up later, but it's not on the overview.
5206680	5208680	Okay, because I remember that part.
5208680	5209240	Yeah.
5209240	5213160	And that is locked up in a safe in my motel room, right?
5213160	5214680	Hotel motel, baby.
5214680	5215320	So it...
5216120	5217960	I mean, definitely we need to go check that out.
5217960	5221480	I even said that we need to go check out Beans Pond at one point.
5221560	5222920	Yeah, you definitely did.
5222920	5228440	So probably go get that watch and maybe see what happens if the other boys put it on.
5228440	5229640	Hmm, interesting.
5230280	5231160	Joe, write that down.
5233320	5233560	Joe?
5234600	5235080	Joe?
5235080	5235720	Joe?
5235720	5235960	Joe?
5235960	5237640	Maladory writes,
5237640	5242040	Is there any beans left or is Keith the last standing member?
5242040	5244360	Oh, the last standing inheritor.
5244920	5246520	So my bro's dead.
5248040	5249720	My parents are dead.
5249800	5251320	His wife is dead.
5252040	5253800	Is my niece alive still?
5254600	5255320	Well, I don't know.
5256280	5257240	We never saw her die.
5257240	5263560	So possibly, I guess, she would inherit my brother's stuff.
5263560	5267640	But I think it's just me, Bean, and my niece.
5268280	5272120	Do you have any theories about your fellow officers?
5272120	5274680	Any secrets you think they might be hiding from you?
5274680	5275880	Things they're lying about?
5275880	5281960	I think that Clark probably knows more than he's leading on about the circle,
5281960	5284200	since he's the only one that's visited it.
5284200	5287000	I don't know if he knows more about, like, old Clark,
5287000	5291960	but I think there's maybe something that he hasn't necessarily lied about,
5291960	5293080	but just hasn't let up.
5294120	5296280	And then who fucking knows with Pettymore?
5297320	5299640	Nothing off the top of my head that I can think of,
5299640	5303560	like, that I have a suspicion about, but I'm sure there's something.
5303560	5307160	He's always being sneaky and hiding shit.
5308440	5310440	Always sneaky.
5310440	5312200	Always hiding shit.
5312920	5314360	John Lee Pettymore.
5314360	5315160	Are we all back now?
5315160	5316520	The crew's back together.
5317160	5317720	Welcome.
5318520	5319480	Hello, everybody.
5319480	5322520	Welcome to Calm Camfy Comf Grounds.
5323240	5325960	Calm Camfy Comf Grounds.
5325960	5326280	No.
5327240	5330680	Hey, I got another question.
5331960	5333320	It's from Bazinga Begins.
5333800	5339160	What's the coolest piece of lore or detail that no one or too few people have picked up on yet?
5339960	5344040	I don't use, like, so much Delta Green lore.
5344040	5346520	I think it's very good and interesting,
5346520	5350760	but I am far more interested in, like, coming up with homebrew shit,
5350760	5357640	and so I don't use a lot of the, like, main lore about the program or the outlaws.
5357640	5360040	I will here and there cherry pick stuff to use, but...
5360040	5362760	What about Zachy Reeves lore that nobody's picked up on?
5363640	5364520	Zachy Reeves lore.
5364520	5367240	Well, we got another question here, also asked by Bazinga Begins.
5367240	5369960	They said, related to the Kudzu no backbone
5369960	5372360	Silver Sphere relationship brought up last week,
5373000	5378760	were the character developments that happened to the boys after their deaths in the Den of Sin
5379320	5382680	supposed to be a weird reversal of the Wizard of Oz?
5383240	5387400	Clark loses his heart, John Lee Pettymore loses his spine,
5387400	5390520	and Keith loses his mind and his empathy.
5391080	5391640	Hmm.
5391640	5397880	And this makes me so happy because I never thought anyone would get that, ever.
5397880	5400840	I just thought I thought it was such a silly little thing
5401640	5406280	that, like, is so subtle and stupid that, like, no one would ever pick up on it.
5406280	5412200	So, bless you, Bazinga Begins, for being the first person I've seen to make that connection.
5412200	5412520	Hell yeah.
5412520	5414760	I had not made that connection at all.
5414760	5419480	I was so high when I put that together,
5419480	5424200	and it's because, uh...
5424200	5425400	It was because it's...
5425400	5430280	This is also really fucking stupid, but it's because Oz Mayhem Wolf was there.
5430280	5431480	Oh, wow, sure.
5431480	5434680	And I just, like, saw it and then, like, started thinking about it
5434680	5437160	because I was thinking about the spine, and then I was like,
5437160	5439880	oh, ha, ha, like, when I came up with the heart thing,
5439880	5444520	then I knew that we had to do something with Luke for the mind,
5444520	5446280	and I didn't know how I was going to do it.
5446280	5448120	And then I sent out everybody, like,
5448120	5453800	hey, pick your talents, and Luke literally picked a talent that got rid of his empathy.
5455880	5460200	And so he literally just, like, fulfilled it without me having to do anything.
5460200	5464120	So that was, like, the coolest shit that made me really happy.
5464120	5468040	But Oz, he had a brother, and I was coming up with a brother's name,
5468840	5475000	and his name is Elby because Oz is ounce and Elby is pound.
5477000	5480440	It's just, honestly, it's a lot of dumb little shit like that,
5480440	5484040	but the Wizard of Oz reversal was one of the bigger ones.
5484040	5485320	That's super cool.
5485320	5486600	I'm excited to talk.
5486600	5489400	Like, at the very end of this whole, like, campaign,
5490520	5493720	I'll do a walkthrough of my dumb shit.
5493720	5495320	Joe, that's one of your favorite movies, right?
5495320	5496520	Yeah, Wizard of Oz is...
5496520	5500120	I have the poster hanging on my wall back there.
5500120	5500620	It's...
5501160	5503400	This one's on Joe, guys.
5503400	5506280	Which version?
5506280	5508280	The James Franco masterpiece.
5510840	5511640	I've actually got...
5511640	5514200	So the Wizard of Oz poster is a reprint,
5514200	5517880	but I've got an original Return to Oz poster hanging over there, too.
5517880	5518840	Oh, damn!
5518840	5520520	Yeah, because I love Return to Oz.
5520520	5521320	It's great, also.
5521320	5523720	I honestly don't know if I've ever seen Return to Oz.
5523720	5524600	It holds up, dude.
5524600	5527320	It's so bizarre and cool-looking.
5527320	5528280	It's good.
5528280	5530600	Is it the same actors, or...?
5530600	5531000	Nah.
5531000	5532920	Dorothy is played by Feruza Balk.
5533480	5535400	You guys might know her from Waterboy.
5535400	5536120	Interesting.
5536120	5537080	That's Kathy Bates.
5537080	5538840	That's your Feruza Balk pull?
5539560	5540840	Yeah, for sure it is.
5542920	5546760	Have you ever seen the HBO series about the Wizard of Oz?
5551560	5552440	Oh, boy.
5552440	5554360	I was late on the uptick on that one.
5554360	5559400	I'll have to watch Return to Oz to come up with my plot for next season.
5560360	5561880	Maladory asks,
5561880	5567320	For the boys, what is the plot thread you are most interested in seeing the end of?
5568120	5570520	And then another question which I don't want you to answer.
5572600	5576280	Plot thread you aren't interested in slash care the least about.
5577560	5578440	Be nice, guys.
5579640	5581160	I just want to go back to contention.
5581160	5583080	I want to see what's up with that.
5583080	5584280	What's up with that?
5584280	5585960	All the helmet and gun and stuff.
5586520	5588360	That's what I wrote down in my notes.
5588360	5593880	I really wish that, A, the helmet itself, but B, just all the relationships with those items
5593880	5598200	and all their history and all that is a thread that I would love to know more about.
5598200	5600280	Yeah, I want to see how contention got the way it is
5600920	5607000	and why it's so connected to all this shit seemingly going back quite far in its past.
5607000	5610360	I really want to see the backstory for Rich and Dick Nichols.
5611160	5613480	30-something episodes of how they got.
5613480	5616120	That's what the people have really been demanding.
5616840	5621480	There's a lot of Rich and Dick stans out there who add us constantly.
5622280	5625640	They sent us pretty abusive DMs, but we get it.
5625640	5626920	You're passionate.
5626920	5628280	You're passionate for Rick and Dick.
5629640	5630760	Honestly, that's a conkin.
5632680	5633160	Call back.
5633960	5635400	Yeah, hashtag conkin.
5635400	5637080	That's what a lot of the stans say.
5639160	5640280	All our conkers out there.
5641880	5645640	What we're saying is we hear you and if we reach a certain Patreon goal,
5645640	5652680	there will be just a slice of life sitcom spin-off where they're roommates.
5652680	5654040	And we got one.
5654040	5655080	Oh wait, sorry.
5655080	5657400	Which plot threads do you guys care the least about?
5658120	5658920	They're all great.
5665560	5667640	And we got one last question here.
5667640	5669080	Justin, take it away.
5669080	5674360	BXBori9181 asks, what happened to Keith's dog?
5674520	5680840	They posted this question on the first Q&A and we talked about it and then we recorded
5680840	5685800	last week's episode and then they posted it on this week's episode and then edited their post
5685800	5687560	and was like, wait, just kidding.
5687560	5688440	Just got there.
5688440	5689640	Just got to where you answered.
5691160	5696040	But someone else pointed out that we didn't really answer because while we did a freeze
5696040	5703240	frame and paragraph for every animal that was in there that talked, we did not do one for Bean.
5704360	5708280	I didn't realize that, that's great.
5708280	5717000	So the whole point of the episode was to figure out where Bean had been and we still don't know.
5717000	5721720	We have the peace of mind that he's not like rotting in the hotel room.
5721720	5722220	Yeah.
5722680	5725480	He's out on his own eating trash and licking ass.
5725480	5727880	Just like we all aim to do.
5727880	5729640	All right, well, this has been long.
5731640	5732280	I'm hungry.
5732280	5735640	Quantity over quality, baby.
5737800	5739160	Thanks for all the questions.
5739160	5740520	They were all really good, I thought.
5740520	5742760	I'm glad you guys are interested enough to ask.
5742760	5744040	Very insightful.
5744040	5746440	Not a single wolf, the dog question in there.
5746440	5747480	So fuck you guys.
5747480	5748600	And I'm never coming back.
5752760	5756440	So yeah, we're going to be doing some open casting for the new wolf.
5756440	5761880	If you want to do like a cool reboot version of wolf.
5761880	5764120	Younger, hotter.
5764120	5765240	Younger, hotter, yeah.
5766280	5767320	Wolf origins.
5768120	5770360	Email your auditions to what's the...
5770360	5771880	Well, just post it in the subreddit.
5772840	5775960	Post it in the subreddit or tweet it at us.
5775960	5776840	Any auditions.
5779080	5784920	If you want to take over the editing job, you can send in your resume.
5785800	5787720	Yeah, we'll give you like all the Patreon.
5791320	5792280	I'm tired.
5792280	5793160	I'm so tired.
5794200	5796760	Yeah, no, thank you all so much for listening.
5796760	5798440	This has been over for some time.
5798440	5800440	No, thank you all so much.
5800440	5804440	And final word from everyone.
5804440	5806840	Mine will be love.
5807800	5810440	Your body, baby.
5845560	5848440	The only one trying to
5853480	5854360	have enough
5874920	5876440	to find.
