0	3040	Hello, my little weirdos.
3040	5920	It's your giant father, Wolf the Dog.
5920	9680	And I'm here to embrace you freaky little dudes.
9680	15440	Society may reject you, but your great mother wolf never shall.
15440	21120	You provide your ears, your minds, your energies.
21120	26240	And I provide you with the greatest radio show this side of the Polaris.
26240	33840	And I am shipping out auditory waves live from 694.2 PTBP.
33840	38720	The only radio station that lets little weirdos like you
38720	43360	write in things that I am contractually obligated to read.
43360	48240	Speaking of, this edition of Howlin' with Wolf comes from Liddy in the City,
48240	52160	who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.
52160	56000	The third best thing you can do with them thumbs.
56000	58160	Liddy in the City writes,
58160	61680	Hey Wolf, thanks for all the rippin' songs.
61680	65840	Altagirl is keepin' my grip strong as I move along.
65840	68240	Swiftly through this shitty city.
68240	70320	But I long to be strong.
70320	73680	To no longer be a pawn who keeps calm.
73680	75600	I want the full throttle.
75600	78960	No doddle logical like Aristotle.
78960	81040	Light the rag in this bottle.
81040	82400	Fuck Fred Godel.
83440	85760	Well, thanks, Liddy in the City.
85760	89840	There was an awful lot of rhymin' in this Howlin' with Wolf.
89840	94800	Is this that slam poetry I've heard so much about?
94800	97680	Now you did a good job, Liddy in the City.
97680	100960	I would snap my fingers in appreciation.
100960	108240	But unfortunately, the grease prevents any friction between any of my body parts.
108240	112080	If you want to write up something for your loving wolf to howl,
112080	115280	tag at Pretending Pod on your social media accounts
115360	119120	and let your friends know that you're an absolute weirdo.
119120	122880	If they're your friends, they're probably pretty strange too.
122880	126240	And if you want to have that sort of conversation in public,
126240	128400	go to PretendingPod.shop
128400	131440	and grab a hat that says PTBP
131440	134080	or a super rad fanny pack
134080	139360	with a four-panel cartoon of What Went Down at Splashylvania on it.
139360	143520	You'll have a new group of freaks to hang out with in no time.
143520	144640	Don't go out?
144640	148000	You can take this game to a high score situation
148000	152880	by posting pics of your hot new PTBP merch online
152880	157040	from the comfort and safety of your mobile device.
157040	159040	The options are endless.
159040	162000	And the links are in the show notes.
162720	164800	S-E-G-U-E
164800	166720	S-E-G-U-E
166720	168480	S-E-G-U-E
168480	170640	And yes, this is a segue.
170640	172320	It's time for the news.
172320	173520	Last time,
173520	176160	Julius ran back into Grover's Gorge
176160	178800	to get away from the wet energy
178800	181920	that erupted out of Chuck Bidwell's body
181920	184800	when it landed in the unnatural chasm,
184800	188240	exploded through the stained glass of the church
188240	191760	that stuck upside down in the smooth crevasse,
191760	194960	and everyone else was knocked unconscious.
194960	199360	The conscious can field producer found Fox Gottel
199360	203280	and brought him back to the rest of the can crew with a plan.
203280	206640	As they came to, Julius asked Stevie,
206640	209280	as the eldest Gottel in the area,
209280	213040	to declare Fox the new mayor of Grover's Gorge.
213040	215440	No one expected it to work,
215440	218880	but that sloppy god came bursting back out
218880	221040	through the colorful church windows
221040	226160	and launched Fox Gottel into the air like a video game KO.
226160	229360	Let's have a toon take us to the action.
229360	231840	Here's an oldie, but a goodie.
231840	237520	It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.
261840	274560	High School Musical.
274560	274800	Yeah.
274800	276560	High School Musical 2.
277440	278640	Is there a second one?
278640	280480	Oh, aren't there like five or six?
280480	281920	What would the second one be called?
281920	282960	College Musical.
282960	283280	College.
285120	286000	And the third one?
286000	287120	30-Year-Old Musical.
287120	288160	Internship Musical.
289360	290640	And they're now making a fourth one.
290640	293600	I think that's the only series that happens in high school.
293600	294400	Yeah.
294400	297120	If I said Pleasantville was the scene.
297120	298080	Orgasm.
299280	299680	Yeah.
299680	300960	I haven't seen Pleasantville since...
302160	302960	Maybe ever.
302960	303760	Since I was a kid.
303760	304320	That scene?
305040	305760	Yeah.
305760	307840	Is that the one where things become color?
307840	308160	Yeah.
308960	309360	Nice.
310240	310880	Sinful.
310880	311680	Because of it.
311680	312880	Because of cum-een.
313600	316160	The scene where they drive into the park
316160	318560	and the cherry blossoms are floating over the car
318560	320880	and Edda James, at last, is playing is like...
321520	322240	I didn't jerk off to that one.
322240	322800	Cinema bliss.
326080	327200	You were saying though, it's...
327920	329120	It's a good scene.
330240	331120	There's also...
331120	334160	He's describing what the world outside of Pleasantville is like
334160	336240	and Dave Brubeck's Take 5
338400	340800	starts just kind of slowly coming in in the background.
340800	341760	It's such a cool scene.
341760	342800	Y'all watching Andor?
343360	344320	You watch that Andor?
344320	346480	I'm not caught up, but I've seen...
346480	348080	I think I'm just like one behind.
348160	348640	Cool.
348640	350560	If you're out there and you can hear my voice
351280	352960	and you have Disney Plus.
352960	355760	Or a friend you can rope in to giving you their login.
355760	356080	Yep.
356080	357200	Just rope them.
357200	360720	Just rope them right on up to their homestead.
360720	361840	Just rope them.
361840	364800	Lasso them and don't let them go until they tell you that Disney logo.
364800	366000	Hoe time.
366000	367760	And then watch Andor.
367760	368240	Yeah.
368240	370640	It's so good.
370640	372240	It's so good.
372240	373200	It's real good.
373200	373760	It's good.
373760	374400	It's good.
375200	377200	Like watch it.
377200	378560	If you're listening, watch it.
378560	380160	Because I want more of it.
380960	381600	Me too.
381600	384560	But I've tried to have this conversation a few times in real life.
384560	385760	Oh, well don't do that.
385760	387280	Just say it where people can't talk back.
388560	389200	No, no, no.
389200	390880	Nobody ever talks back.
390880	391840	It's just that they're like,
391840	392960	Oh, yeah, that sounds nice for you.
392960	394560	No one ever talks back.
394560	395200	Exactly.
395760	397360	I'm glad, nerd.
398320	399200	Good for you.
399200	401440	You have a gritty Star Wars.
401440	401760	Wow.
401760	405120	Now a gritty Star Wars.
405120	405920	I'd be interested.
412720	414240	It's set on Kashyyyk.
414240	414880	Yes.
414880	416160	Philadelphia Kashyyyk.
418560	419360	Oh, my God.
419920	420400	I don't know.
420400	421840	Watch the shit out of that.
421840	422960	The day it came out.
422960	426480	Gritty is probably the kind of thing that might get old for other people,
426480	428560	but I will enjoy until the day I die.
428800	433280	I think it's just the right time for me to grow old and always be delighted for it.
433280	434160	And my kids will be like,
434160	435120	Yeah, everything's a gritty.
435120	441120	Like there's mascots that kill each other now and say the F word.
442400	443440	Gritty fucking sucks.
443440	444960	And I'm like, nah, gritty is delightful.
447360	450400	Everything's a gritty is incredible.
450400	451760	I like when he wiggles his tummy.
452480	453200	It's pretty good.
454720	458320	Speaking of gritty, we all look a little grittier now, don't we, boys?
459360	460640	Do you mean the can crew?
460640	464240	No, I mean, well, the king crew definitely fucking works pretty gritty.
464240	465840	Or do you mean us after two and a half years of a pandemic?
468080	469520	What else did we do that might make us like different women?
469520	471120	We were all gritty for Halloween.
471120	471680	That's right.
471680	473200	We were all gritty for Halloween.
473200	474640	No, but we should have done that.
474640	475440	Gritty gang.
475440	476960	Oh, oh, yeah.
476960	479360	Aren't we a little bit more gritty guys?
479360	480080	You're right.
480080	481280	We got tat week.
481280	482800	We all got sick tats.
482800	483680	Sick tats.
486640	488160	Dude, we got sick tats.
488640	490880	I was sick tat like best ever.
493040	493840	Hey, can you believe it?
493840	496480	Four white guys got a tattoo to commemorate their podcast.
499360	503600	Four guys who like would have never had skulls tattooed on them.
503600	504480	Likely.
504480	506000	No, no.
506000	508960	That was kind of the beauty for me is that I think I would have gotten a skull.
508960	510560	It just happened to be our podcast logo.
510560	511440	Oh, hell yeah.
512320	514640	I might get more skulls of different styles.
514640	516080	Not in like a crazy.
516080	518800	You should just get the same skull all over.
519840	520400	I should know.
520400	521840	I'm just, yeah, Luke's right.
521840	523600	I'm just going to get the PTPB skull.
523600	525760	One for every man you've killed.
525760	526000	Yeah.
526000	526880	Perhaps.
526880	527120	Three.
528320	529600	Said that really quick.
529600	530800	He said that really quick.
530800	531760	You don't forget them.
531760	532640	Well, I never do.
532640	533280	It's good.
533280	535440	I think if you don't, I guess.
535440	536320	Is that better?
536320	536960	What do you think?
536960	539360	Is it better to remember those that you've murdered?
541040	542400	You gotta leave the past behind.
544800	550000	Oh, well, I would like to get into this episode by asking you guys how you feel.
550000	552320	We're on episode 16 of season two.
552320	555280	We're like getting into the weeds of this thing.
555920	557280	Shit is popping off.
557920	559120	Shit is popping off.
559120	560880	What is going through your mind?
560880	564480	What were we doing in episode 16 of season one?
564480	565600	That's a good question.
565600	568400	Just for some, like, you know, some sort of reference.
568400	574240	Episode 16 of season one was titled like father, like surrogate son.
574320	577920	So it was the second of three flashback episodes.
577920	578480	Oh yeah.
578480	583440	This is the one where John Lee Pettymore's racing past and injury is explored.
583440	587600	The episode notes say John Lee Pettymore's past is explored.
588560	590000	Rules are ignored.
590000	593680	The officers check out the house of the Lord.
593680	597280	So we go to the church and you eat their pasta salad or whatever it was?
597280	600080	Yeah, no, I eat some of it and then I put it back.
600080	601280	It's so weird.
601280	605120	The time dilation that makes me think that that was so much later in the season and it's
605120	606400	only episode 16.
606400	610800	See, so now do you, how do you feel about being in episode 16 of season two?
611760	614320	I think we can do this one faster.
614320	619680	It feels like it's moving faster to me, but I don't know how it feels to you guys.
619680	620720	Yeah, I think so.
621280	625600	Listening back to the first season, I guess I know everything, but it's like...
625600	627680	Let's try to go into spoilers on season one.
627680	631280	I know we talked about eating food and that's pretty intense, but...
631280	631920	You're right.
631920	637600	So without any spoilers, without any spoilers, I'm just like...
637600	638480	With no incident.
638480	641440	I was just like, oh, we should have, we should have figured out some more of this.
643440	644960	This time around, how do you feel?
644960	648080	Do you feel like you're getting the information, the lore?
648080	650720	Do you feel like you have an understanding of what's going on?
650720	652160	We nailed that God total shit.
655200	656400	Yeah, we're all over this.
656400	658720	So you're saying there's no need to theorize?
658720	660320	No, I know exactly what's happening.
660320	662720	We can skip to the end and summarize the mystery if you want us to.
663520	664320	It's real easy.
664320	668720	There was a God turtle and through the decades, it became Godel.
673440	674880	And it wants to...
674880	677680	Turn everyone into a church.
683920	685840	So like we said, Zach, we're all over it.
686720	687220	Perfect.
688880	693360	Well, then I think it's time to hop on in and we're going to start with Thomas.
693360	694400	Dive on in.
694400	696000	You, I believe, broke yourself.
702000	704320	Sorry, I am doing a season one re-listen.
704320	705920	We're also, we just played.
705920	706800	Oh yeah, we just played.
706800	709200	The last thing we played was our character, our season one character.
709200	709440	Yeah.
709440	714560	And by the time you hear this episode, you can go to patreon.com slash pretending pod
715200	716480	and check out.
716480	719120	Well, maybe by the time you listen to this episode,
719120	720880	It's not this Friday, but next Friday.
720880	726240	During this month, the month that this episode comes out, you'll be able to hear John Lee
726240	729440	Pettymore, Clark Bishop, and Keith Vigna.
730080	731360	Oh, I'm so sorry.
731360	732160	Doing what?
732160	733280	We trick or treated.
733280	735680	We smell my feet.
737440	739360	We got us something good to eat it.
739360	740320	Perfect.
740320	742640	So you can go to patreon.com slash pretending.
743200	746400	And listen to it's the butter finger bandit, Keith beans.
748160	751200	But for now I need Mr. Jotaro.
751200	752560	Mation motion picture.
754080	757280	Dr. Luke Kinteman, please remove your headphones.
757280	761120	I brought my Bluetooth headphones like Thomas did last episode.
761120	763600	Now I don't have to wiggle my fingers in my ears.
765040	765540	Thomas.
766160	772000	This season, season two, we are choosing our own, so it's kind of up to us to decide
772000	776320	whatever your mania phobia weird character hiccup is.
776320	779360	So what was it that happened when you broke?
779360	780400	What did you see?
780400	781520	Well, that's the deal, Zach.
781520	782320	I don't really know.
782320	787760	You told me it was an Olympic pool sized fluid amount of wet energy.
787760	788320	Yeah.
788320	789120	Wet energy.
789680	791520	Big wet energy or a little wet energy?
791520	793440	I clearly yeah.
793440	794080	Olympic.
794080	794400	Okay.
794400	797600	So are you afraid of people who look like they might be Olympians?
798240	798560	Yeah.
798560	802400	My only, the only way this affects me is that I have a distaste from Michael Phelps.
803040	807360	You're really, you want to become a swimmer more than anything in the world.
807360	808400	That's quite a coincidence.
808400	811440	You would notice, of course, the cow is pretty fit for his age.
811440	814000	And one of the ways he keeps that up, what?
814000	814880	I saw that dance.
814880	815440	Oh, right.
815440	816080	Exactly.
816080	820880	So he couldn't run anymore because of his bad left knee, but he took up swimming and
820880	827120	every year for the past 20 years, he has done, um, whatever, whatever a healthy amount of
827120	827520	laps.
828480	831680	I don't know what a good amount of laps across an Olympic swimming pool is.
831680	836320	I would say like for me, one, one and a half, if I could get to the second side, that'd
836320	838080	be best for living.
838080	838720	Yeah.
838720	840320	You don't want to stop halfway through.
840320	840800	Nope.
840800	842080	Unless you're close to the edge.
842080	842640	That's right.
842640	848000	Cal Colorado does a more than healthy amount of laps for a man of his age for a man of
848000	849200	10 or 15 years younger.
850240	851040	Perhaps.
851040	854800	And he may not realize it standing here right now looking at this thing.
854800	859600	Well, it's already like past and in Fox Godel who is like splayed out on the ground over
859600	862080	by the plant wall, seemingly wet.
862080	864800	He doesn't like it that he doesn't like it at all.
864800	869760	And the next time he might, who knows if he stops himself as he walks out the door, go
869760	874160	into the pool or if he gets to the edge and reaches in and like starts to dive in.
874160	874720	Sure.
874720	878800	So we're going to say that it's specifically because you noticed that it was the size of
878800	882720	the pool and I think it's, I think it's going to be large bodies, large bodies of water.
883440	887520	And maybe, maybe some, maybe some water in general, but mostly large masses.
887520	888320	Whatever you do, man.
890240	891520	All right, let's bird them boys.
893200	898400	The last thing you guys saw, the last thing I saw was God.
898400	902640	So the end of the last episode, it's hairy as far as what we can listen to, but I think
902640	905680	I'm frozen in shock at my moment in time.
905680	912560	Absolutely frozen in shock as you're looking down, which means that you see first
912560	922640	this energy, this enormous wet energy that you've seen before, almost pouring out of
922640	928560	this church building that you see in the bottom of this unnatural chasm in this valley.
928560	935680	It is filling it up in the bottom and then it is flying up out toward you over the cliff.
935680	942480	Luke, Julia Summers sees the same sort of wet energy you've noticed before fling itself
942480	948480	and the two of you see this time exactly like last time, just crashes.
948480	958720	This time into Fox Godel, throwing her backwards, flying out towards the plant wall and he lands
958720	959760	with a thud.
959760	966560	The wet that has been surrounding and around and just pushes itself in and around him almost
966560	973920	seems to dissipate into nothingness as you see a soaking wet Fox Godel laying unconscious
973920	975280	on the ground.
975280	978400	I need Beck Wilder and Julia Summers to roll grip.
980480	982400	Thomas, you rolled last time.
982400	984080	At the end of the last episode.
984080	984640	I pass.
985200	985600	I don't.
988160	994480	When you pass, you're still going to lose one grip due to the enormity of this situation
994480	1000400	and because you've seen it before, this kind of impacts your opinion of the last time you
1000400	1001920	saw this happen, right?
1003120	1007440	You almost expected it halfway through, but then it's all of a sudden over.
1007440	1012160	You slightly see the same result and Julia Summers, I need you to roll a d4 and add one.
1013280	1017360	That's a three plus one, which gets me to my breaking point.
1017440	1022560	Oh, second breaking point of season two.
1022560	1024560	Julia Summers, where are you at grip wise?
1024560	1025440	I'm at 36.
1026320	1027360	What did you start with?
1027360	1029120	What's your power power?
1029120	1029680	60.
1029680	1030160	Dang.
1030160	1035600	You're almost halfway through the grip that you had the tethered to the world in which
1035600	1037840	you lived is almost halfway gone.
1037840	1039600	That's not great.
1039600	1042880	You roll with what you get and you roll what you get.
1042880	1046240	In that case, let's hit you with this breaking point right now.
1046320	1048320	Joe Thomas, headphones babies.
1048320	1049760	I'm going back to Katy Perry.
1051600	1053360	Is that what you're guitar soloing to?
1055200	1058320	Was my last one that I don't like running water?
1058320	1059120	Yeah, that's right.
1059120	1060640	So what are we going to do this time?
1060640	1064560	We have a similar situation that brought you to this point, but you've seen a lot.
1064560	1066400	You've had a lot happen to you.
1066400	1073600	You're currently like face half broken, barely like the bones barely holding themselves
1073600	1074240	together.
1074240	1080240	Every time you like move quickly, you kind of feel the ajarness within the skeleton of
1080240	1080960	your face.
1080960	1081680	Owie.
1081680	1082720	Owie, owie, dude.
1085200	1086560	That is not good.
1087200	1089840	I'm trying to think what would make sense here.
1089840	1090160	Okay.
1090160	1093120	So we've got heights as a situation here.
1093120	1099040	We have the cane that hit your face repeatedly that brought you to this point.
1099040	1102080	It's the most physical pain you've ever been in your life, I would assume.
1102080	1102320	Yeah.
1102400	1104480	Closest he's ever been to dying for sure.
1104480	1105040	Yeah.
1105040	1109040	So I think maybe doing something with your face is a fine idea.
1109040	1111040	Doing something with heights is a fine idea.
1111040	1113440	Doing something else with water is a fine idea.
1113440	1118800	What if because of this injury, I don't recognize my face?
1118800	1119300	Whoa.
1120400	1126560	But it's like, not feel somehow trapped in a body that is not my own.
1126560	1127520	Fascinating.
1127520	1129520	Do you feel comfortable playing that?
1129520	1130000	Sure.
1130000	1130640	Fuck yeah.
1130640	1131520	That's scary.
1131520	1131840	Right.
1132480	1135120	I think not until he sees his reflection.
1135120	1135680	That's right.
1135680	1136320	That's right.
1136320	1136720	Okay.
1136720	1137760	Sounds good, man.
1137760	1138320	All right, cool.
1138320	1139280	Let's burn him back.
1139280	1140160	Okay, cool.
1140160	1141600	Thomas, what were you listening to?
1141600	1142720	The new Beths album.
1142720	1144800	Ooh, love them.
1144800	1145440	Me too.
1145440	1146320	The new Beths.
1147920	1149200	Frozen solid.
1149200	1152880	Beck Wilder cannot even move his face.
1152880	1159760	You just hear the thrust and out of the corner of your eye, you see Fox Gottel flying out
1159760	1160880	of eye shot.
1160880	1161360	Nailed it.
1162720	1163440	What?
1164800	1165120	Why?
1165120	1166720	Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
1167680	1172880	And Stevie is trying to hold back the vomit that seems to be coming.
1172880	1174400	Oh, and she cannot hold.
1175600	1176880	She starts blowing.
1179440	1182480	Oh no, you're going to make me throw up now.
1191840	1198320	I swallowed it.
1199600	1205120	Falls to her hands and knees and Fox Gottel laying on his back completely unconscious,
1205120	1211600	wearing a monochromatic gray scale jumpsuit leisure wear with green accents like he's
1211600	1218240	been dancing in the AR goggles have literally landed in the place where he was just standing
1218240	1224960	at least, god, I don't even know, like 36.8 feet away.
1224960	1226400	He's just like vanished?
1226400	1232320	No, he is on the ground over by the plant wall on his back, unconscious and wet.
1232320	1234480	And you see him wearing those clothes.
1234480	1236400	I want to, I guess, pick up the goggles.
1236400	1241200	Yeah, when you pick them up, you see that he's been kicking Julius Summers' ass
1243040	1244880	in a ring collecting game.
1244880	1249120	Julius, what have you been engaging in leisurely video games on working hours?
1249120	1257280	Julius is like just with his goggles still on, just staring down at his feet and like
1257280	1261040	finally just pulls the headset off and you can see he's been like sobbing.
1261040	1263360	Well, I was going to joke about you losing, but now
1263360	1266160	the headset just kind of falls to the ground and he's like,
1266160	1269040	when you look at it on the ground, what do you see?
1269040	1274560	Julius sees his own reflection in the visor, the visor goggles.
1274560	1280000	And he just starts kind of like looking and like squeezing his face and like scratching his face.
1280000	1283920	When the two of you see him scratching in his face and feeling it away,
1283920	1290720	like you see some of the cartilage is like pushing out of his skin as he's playing with it.
1290720	1292080	Cow Colorado vomits.
1292080	1292580	Gross.
1295680	1297760	Oh, Thomas, you're going to make me.
1297760	1298260	Oh no.
1300480	1302320	People are going to complain that they actually vomited.
1302320	1305200	I was going to say that is a trigger for some people pretty hard.
1307360	1308960	Am I jumping out of freeze mode?
1308960	1309680	Yeah. Where do you want to?
1310240	1310720	Not yet.
1310720	1315360	The two of you look over and see Beck Wilder has not moved a muscle.
1315360	1319840	Stevie has run over at this point and crawled over on her hands and knees.
1319840	1325040	And they're just like over their brother's body, touching the face, holding the head up.
1325040	1326240	Fox, Fox.
1326880	1328880	Stevie, what the hell was that?
1328880	1330720	I guess it worked.
1330720	1331600	It worked.
1331680	1333360	She's just nodding to Julius.
1333360	1334720	What, what happened?
1334720	1341920	Well, we've Fox, uh, became the mayor and now he holds God.
1341920	1347040	We it let's try to maintain some journalistic, uh, standards here.
1347040	1349760	We cannot confirm or deny that that is God.
1349760	1353360	Well, the, the turtle spirit isn't right.
1353360	1354720	Let's hope Beck got that.
1354720	1361520	You look over and you see the camera is pointed directly at the opening in the stained glass.
1362080	1366160	Of this church upside down in Godel's feet.
1366160	1367840	Canyon crevasse.
1367840	1373680	As, as we walk over Cal and maybe a rare moment of like opportunistic solidarity with Julius
1373680	1376400	is like, it looks like you might've got a pretty good angle with that.
1377200	1378560	I sure hope so.
1378560	1379200	Fingers crossed.
1379200	1379600	Right.
1379600	1381040	And we get over there and I'm,
1381040	1387200	I want to get an alertness check real quick from both Julius Summers and Cal Colorado.
1389280	1391280	Pass 32 on a 40.
1391840	1393360	Pass nine on whatever.
1394640	1395440	11.
1395440	1397600	It's not the sound of dogs.
1398480	1398960	Oh, good.
1403360	1415440	You know, from the door, but it is the sound of doors opening large doors, not ones that
1415440	1419120	need to be dogged, but not dog doors.
1419120	1421280	Undog doors are opening train doors.
1421760	1424240	Large large creaking doors.
1424240	1425760	Church doors.
1425760	1427040	Oh, that's a church door.
1427040	1429280	That is the creepiest kind of door you can open.
1430720	1438080	And the sound echoes through this area plant wall on either side.
1438640	1441440	It's the sound just kind of bounces back and forth.
1441440	1446000	You all see figures exiting the church going up.
1446080	1453120	Seemingly that fog that rose and formed the penetrable wall previously has dissipated.
1453120	1459920	There must be like steps coming up from the church because these bobbing people is this
1459920	1466080	massive folk that you see just very, very tiny off in the distance are making their
1466080	1469360	way up the unnaturally smooth wall.
1469360	1472640	Somehow maybe steps, maybe some sort of pathway.
1472640	1474160	Must be steps or a pathway.
1474160	1475440	Are they on our side?
1475440	1482960	They're climbing up your side out of the deep alien crevasse and toward the shelf that
1482960	1484400	you all stand on.
1484400	1489520	Uh, back back, back.
1489520	1490960	Are you seeing, are you seeing this buddy?
1490960	1493920	We got a frozen.
1493920	1494960	The camera won't move.
1497280	1498000	Cal is alarm.
1498000	1501760	He starts shaking you, but like by the shoulder back back, snap out of it.
1501760	1505120	Cal, Cal.
1507440	1508240	He slaps you.
1510480	1510720	Sorry.
1510720	1511920	Delayed reaction.
1511920	1512560	My dad.
1518400	1518960	Oh God.
1519680	1520720	Oh, Cal dude.
1521280	1521920	I saw it.
1522720	1524240	It's I saw it.
1526240	1528960	Who, who, who, who are they?
1529600	1531120	And I'm pointing at the figures.
1531120	1535520	I mean, when Beck sees figures, he points the camera at figures.
1535520	1542480	And as he zooms in on this roving gang heading up, you see how many figures are we talking
1542480	1542800	here?
1542800	1544640	We are talking nine figures.
1544640	1545040	Okay.
1545040	1546000	Oh, 10 figures.
1546000	1552800	One is just nope to 11, but two are just closer to the ground.
1552800	1554640	Seemingly a billion.
1554640	1557040	And as you zoom in, you see a gaggle.
1557040	1558080	That's 10 figures.
1558080	1558640	Nice.
1558640	1559040	Don't worry.
1559040	1560160	They're just geese.
1560160	1561280	They're school children.
1561280	1564880	Do they look ghosty or like, are they like ethereal?
1564880	1567360	No, they're wearing school uniforms.
1567360	1573120	And as you guys are looking into the viewfinder of Beck's camera to watch and see these people
1573120	1578800	head up in the back of the group, you see the last school child wearing the same uniform
1578800	1586560	is like on all fours, like on their knuckles and their toes.
1586560	1589440	The next boy, he is just a normal kid.
1592640	1595040	Let's see if that's even stranger for some reason.
1596560	1597680	I don't like that one.
1597680	1599360	He gives me the creeps in particular.
1599360	1602480	There's like seemingly six normal looking ones.
1602480	1604000	It's still quite from a distance.
1604000	1608560	You can't zoom in that far, but they seem to be wearing school uniforms.
1608560	1612160	However, in the back you see, it's like they've got red.
1612160	1612400	Yeah.
1612400	1617840	There's like a bit too much red around on all of them as they come closer to the top.
1617840	1618640	Stevie, what do you think of this?
1618640	1619680	Toward your shelf.
1619680	1620720	Red just around them?
1620720	1620880	Yeah.
1620880	1623040	You're not just going to keep talking about it while they keep climbing.
1623040	1623280	On their clothes.
1623280	1625200	We get to do something about this.
1625200	1629680	And as they all freeze, I'll continue to describe the rest of them.
1630960	1639760	No one makes a step, but in the back you see this human body with a face of a pug dog.
1639760	1645200	As you look down, it's got sharpened claws that are holding onto a leash.
1645200	1647920	And this human body is wearing a school uniform.
1647920	1651280	And on the leash, there is just a jaguar.
1651280	1651920	Cool.
1651920	1652400	The cat.
1653200	1654000	The cat.
1654000	1663280	And in the back is a kangaroo walking up on its hind legs with a very human gait to its walk.
1663280	1669440	It is wearing the school uniform as it follows up the rear as they make it closer to the top.
1669760	1670880	And you zoom in.
1670880	1676720	You see that they have blood on their hands, on their faces, and on their uniforms.
1676720	1677200	Jesus.
1677200	1678800	Stevie, are these the 20s?
1678800	1680880	I need you all to roll grip.
1680880	1681280	Damn.
1683680	1684800	Glad I had that in my notes.
1687120	1688800	I do not pass.
1688800	1689920	I do not pass.
1689920	1691680	I do pass with a 14.
1691680	1696160	In order to decide whether you lose zero grip or one grip, I want you to explain this to me.
1696960	1698080	Why I don't lose sanity?
1698080	1698320	Yeah.
1700480	1701120	I got nothing.
1701120	1701360	I don't...
1701920	1702240	Okay.
1702240	1702880	Lose one grip.
1702880	1703600	I'll lose one, yeah.
1704720	1706240	How much if you fail?
1706240	1710320	The frame wobbles just a minute as it loses a little composure and gets it right back.
1711200	1714320	Let's hit it with a D4 plus one for the two of you.
1714320	1716000	That is four more for me.
1717200	1718240	Oh, shit.
1719040	1726240	Four grip down for Julius, and you are now halfway between your starting power and zero grip.
1726240	1727120	Not quite.
1727120	1727680	Oh, no?
1727680	1728240	32.
1728240	1728720	Oh, damn.
1728720	1729200	My bad.
1729280	1731840	That is five more for Cal Colorado.
1731840	1733280	Whoa.
1733280	1733780	Damn.
1734800	1735360	God damn.
1735360	1737600	Is that a flight, flight or freeze?
1737600	1738720	That's a flying, flying ring.
1738720	1741520	You guys are acting like you've never seen animal children before.
1744560	1745840	It's like Kangaroo Jack.
1746400	1749360	Beck, I don't know what's going on with me, but I'd ask you to shut the fuck up.
1751280	1758960	Stevie also failed the grip, and they're freaking out, but not because of what you see.
1759200	1766000	You just hear sobs and wailing from behind you as kind of the realization of what this
1766000	1767760	all means sets in.
1767760	1768640	Stevie's sobs?
1768640	1770720	Stevie is sobbing from behind you.
1770720	1774320	Their brother probably basically isn't really real anymore.
1775840	1777760	Yeah, I don't know what to make of that.
1777760	1779120	Is he still unconscious?
1779120	1779760	He is, yeah.
1780400	1784320	If you can look back for even half a second and take your eyes off the situation at hand,
1784320	1786000	you would see that he's still on the ground.
1786880	1791280	Julius, he sees the animals and stuff and is just like, nope.
1791280	1796960	And he just goes over and just is like looking at Fox.
1796960	1799120	He's like, I got to look at something that's not going to be that.
1801760	1804400	No, it's just not fair.
1805360	1806800	It's just not fair.
1807440	1813920	Julius bends down and ties Fox's shoes together and then looks at Stevie in case he tries
1813920	1815920	to walk off the ledge like Chuck.
1815920	1818720	As she's just sobbing and nods.
1824240	1825360	Thomas, let's go to you.
1825360	1830240	Cal just lost five grip and so he had to roll for fight, flight, or freeze.
1830240	1831040	Nice.
1831040	1833440	I chose a fight as the least likely.
1834000	1836640	It doesn't even make sense in this situation.
1836640	1838960	I would be that horrified.
1839040	1844160	Followed by flight, followed by freeze, and I rolled flight.
1844160	1850240	So Cal also just turns his back on this and he's like, you're filming this, you got this.
1852000	1853360	Looks like you got a good frame there.
1854800	1861600	I'm going to go see how Julius and the others are doing.
1862320	1863440	Just shout if you need anything.
1864400	1866560	You've already been way far away from me at this point.
1869120	1870800	He's slowly walking and talking.
1872560	1878480	Beck, you see in the background, the single simple steel train car and the single simple
1878480	1883760	steel train car sized simple steel car train station.
1884880	1886080	Say that five times fast.
1886080	1892800	And you see Fox got on the ground and Stevie hands and knees over him and Julius standing
1892800	1897680	kind of hunched over next to Stevie and Cal backing up toward them.
1897680	1903120	I want to zoom in on a face or two of these animal people walking up the stairs.
1903120	1904480	What are they focused on?
1904480	1905760	Are they looking at us?
1905760	1907840	Are they maybe zombie-like?
1907840	1909120	They are not zombie-like.
1909120	1910480	And they're not walking up stairs.
1914800	1916480	What do you think is happening, Thomas?
1916480	1918960	Oh, I thought they were just like climbing the wall, right?
1918960	1922240	I thought it was like ghost stairs that they were walking up.
1922240	1923920	I thought, yeah, I don't know.
1923920	1927280	I think it's ghost stairs because you said the kangaroo had a human walk.
1927360	1928720	It did have a gate, yeah.
1928720	1930640	As it goes straight up the wall.
1931680	1934160	So what do they seem to be focused on?
1935040	1935540	You.
1936160	1944800	Dudes, I don't know like the protocol with like meeting a new species and like how we're
1944800	1949040	supposed to like do that from like a scientific perspective, but they've got blood on their
1949040	1951600	hands and I think we got to get the fuck out of here, dudes.
1951600	1952100	Zoinks.
1952340	1957780	Um, hearing Beck freak out, but then also describe basically what he's seeing.
1957780	1961460	Julius snaps back in and he knows that we have to get this on film.
1963460	1965620	I mean, that's the one thing that's being handled.
1968340	1971780	Julius whips around and just goes, Beck, don't stop filming.
1973940	1975380	Oh yeah, I'm filming, dude.
1976020	1977860	We got to, we got to talk to him.
1977860	1978660	No, no, no, no.
1978660	1979940	I agree with Beck.
1979940	1982660	We need to get back to our mystery machine immediately.
1982660	1986340	And I think we need to take Stevie and God.
1986340	1987300	Let's fucking go.
1988260	1988580	Yeah.
1988580	1990900	Stevie, we got to take your God brother in our van with us.
1990900	1991300	Fine.
1991300	1992100	Let's go.
1992100	1992660	Into the train.
1992660	1993460	Into the train, dudes.
1993460	1998740	Uh, I, Julius helps Stevie, I guess just carry Fox into the train.
1998740	2006340	Your hands as the, uh, as you grab on to the, uh, the legs of Fox Godel.
2006340	2007540	And I need you to roll grip.
2008180	2008740	Is it like.
2008740	2011140	It's wet enough to where water runs.
2011140	2013460	But I'm not like squishing into his body.
2013460	2015460	You're not squishing into his body like Jell-O.
2015460	2021380	No, but the water that is coming out of his clothing squishes and rolls over your hands.
2022180	2030340	And as you don't pass, you drop Fox Godel as you lose one grip and you cannot pick him back up.
2030340	2032180	That makes a pretty good sound.
2032420	2034260	Oh, yeah.
2034260	2038980	Julius catches a glimpse of himself and some of the water that's like reflecting
2038980	2042420	up and just starts picking at his face again and runs to the train.
2042420	2043140	Boom.
2043140	2044500	First one in.
2044500	2045700	Julius Summers.
2046580	2050580	Cal Cal looks at what he must now do, which is pick up this wet Fox.
2051620	2054900	And he is terrified.
2054900	2057940	He, he kind of like, he looks at the wet pant leg.
2057940	2060340	He looks back at the twenties.
2060340	2063620	He looks back at the pant leg and he completely shutters.
2063620	2066340	And he goes, and he picks it.
2066340	2070980	He picks the leg up or tries to go ahead and roll.
2072660	2073700	I pass seven.
2074900	2077380	It takes a huge sigh and like, let's go out.
2077380	2079220	He feels the water running out.
2079220	2080180	He knows where it's from.
2082740	2088260	And he just, he sighs and closes his eyes and he's like, Stevie, if you could just lead the way,
2088260	2092100	I'm going to look over to the side here and just let's walk straight.
2092100	2092740	Walk straight.
2092740	2093060	Okay.
2093060	2093860	Quickly, quickly.
2093860	2094100	All right.
2094100	2094500	Yes.
2094500	2095220	Yes.
2095220	2095620	Beck.
2095620	2096420	Come on Beckworth.
2096420	2098260	The news mate waits for no one.
2098260	2102740	Beck is trying to keep the camera focused on the animal creature.
2102740	2106500	People coming up the stairs, but he is backing it into the train.
2106500	2113140	As you back up into the train, you see them crest over the shelf, over this cliff side.
2113220	2117460	And they are on the same plane as the can crew.
2117460	2123300	And they are staring barrel down, eyes straight into the camera.
2124100	2127460	All of them as they begin running.
2129700	2130900	Oh no, fast zombies.
2132260	2134420	I was going to give them a friendly way of hoping,
2134420	2136100	hoping maybe they would just kind of give me a nice wave back.
2136100	2137620	What do you do as you're halfway,
2137620	2142100	like halfway into a friendly wave as they start sprinting towards you?
2142100	2145700	Yeah, his arm is up about to give like a very hardy,
2145700	2147620	hello there kind of wave.
2147620	2149540	And when he sees them start sprinting,
2150100	2154900	he uses the wave to grab the top doorframe of the train car
2154900	2157220	and throw himself backwards into the train car
2157220	2159060	and hope that the door closes behind him.
2159060	2159860	Good job Beck.
2159860	2160660	Keep filming.
2160660	2164100	Julius says as he's looking out the window, but also at his reflection.
2166260	2167540	Beck is yelling,
2167940	2168980	Train, train, go.
2170820	2172420	Make train, make train move.
2172420	2174260	Move train, train, train move.
2174260	2174980	Oh, oh, oh.
2174980	2177780	Cal throws the last of the lasagna out of his pocket.
2180580	2182020	Oh, those animals are going to love that.
2183220	2184100	Yeah, hopefully.
2184100	2184600	Yes.
2186180	2187140	Hopefully one's a cat.
2187780	2191700	The TV screens mounted on both the front and the rear of this train car,
2191700	2194580	these modern flat screens flicker to life.
2194580	2197940	You see a blank white soundstage with a white stool
2197940	2202340	and a man walks into frame, sits on the stool and smiles at you all, the viewers.
2202340	2204260	Hello, I'm Fred Gaudel.
2204260	2209140	He's a soft looking man in his later 60s with a loose plumpness and glasses
2209140	2213220	that consistently look like they're about to fall off his nose.
2213220	2221220	And the group of bloody school children with animal compatriots runs closer to you all.
2221220	2222980	Has the door closed?
2222980	2223460	Nope.
2223460	2226420	Beck runs up to the screen, is trying to tap the edge like it's a touch screen.
2226420	2228100	Fast forward, fast forward, fast forward, fast forward.
2228100	2228420	We got it.
2228420	2228660	We got it.
2228660	2228980	Hi, Fred.
2228980	2229460	Hey, Fred.
2229460	2230020	We're going.
2230020	2230980	We're finally Fred.
2230980	2231940	Can we do anything here?
2232820	2238420	Let's go ahead and get a roll for like electronics from Beck Wilder.
2239140	2240020	Do you have some sort of...
2240020	2241220	I think I got some.
2242740	2243860	I got computer science.
2243860	2244500	Yeah, there we go.
2246500	2248180	The look you just gave me.
2248180	2248740	What is it?
2248740	2249860	You want to see what I rolled?
2251140	2252260	Yep, yep, yep, yep.
2252260	2253700	That's a critical fail.
2253700	2255540	Are you fucking kidding me?
2255540	2256100	99.
2256100	2257780	That's a 99.
2257780	2260660	Hey, Beck, what do you do to the TV, man?
2260660	2261940	I guess I'd smash it.
2264420	2270500	In my frantic tappings, tappings turn to fist pounding, fist pounding turns to all outrage
2270500	2273060	to try and get this fucking train going.
2273060	2274660	Like David Ortiz at a telephone.
2276740	2280980	Can any of you come up with a reason why I should get this train going?
2283220	2284580	No, but I'm hoping you can.
2284580	2296100	Stevie, what do we do?
2301940	2305380	We have to get out and we have to run across the tracks, I guess.
2305380	2308420	Some of us might not make it and we might not be able to get Fox across.
2308420	2310660	That's going to be our most important task, okay?
2310900	2312660	Thank God I'm not afraid of heights.
2312660	2323060	Yes, we have to make sure that Fox doesn't fall to his death because that'll unleash
2323060	2325380	it again and we have to get him across.
2325380	2330100	But I guess this thing isn't going to start, so we need to get the fuck over across right
2330100	2330260	now.
2330260	2332740	What happens if you just try to like pull the door shut?
2332740	2335780	I guess try to pull the door shut and we'll see what happens here.
2335780	2338500	Do you have some sort of mechanical engineering?
2338820	2341780	Anyone with mechanical engineering?
2341780	2342740	Strength?
2342740	2344340	I mean, yeah, I was just going to use strength.
2344900	2346260	I don't have anything.
2346260	2348500	Okay, I could persuade the doors to close.
2349300	2349860	It could work.
2349860	2353060	It's a smart train kind of past 21 on a 50.
2353060	2362100	Okay, you pull these doors and as you pull them, you're able to get both sides shut.
2362100	2367620	Now we're going to have to roll a very important luck check here to see if that actually gets
2367620	2368740	the train moving.
2368740	2370820	Can I spend my luck on a luck roll?
2370820	2372180	I guess if you lose it.
2372180	2374580	If you need to on this luck roll.
2376260	2377220	I don't.
2377220	2377780	40.
2377780	2379460	Oh, you don't need to spend it.
2379460	2383940	Ah, that is a much better situation.
2383940	2388020	Should we cut out the part where I came up with a super cool idea to run across the train
2388020	2388340	tracks?
2388980	2391860	Maybe because Beck was going to say they got a fucking jaguar with him.
2391860	2393780	We're not going to outrun these animals.
2393780	2394580	There was no way.
2394900	2401460	That's another full episode of us being picked off one by one by monsters.
2401460	2407300	One by one survival horror across train tracks above a massive 80 story gulch.
2407300	2411220	Yeah, that sounds like a good concept for the board game maybe.
2413300	2419140	As the doors shut, Julius wants to address the train as if it is Frank Godel.
2419140	2421540	Wait, is that their dad or grandpa?
2421540	2422820	I rolled luck and succeeded.
2422900	2427300	Yeah, but you know, he's talking to the train while you're getting it to work.
2427300	2427540	Right.
2428580	2429460	Gotcha.
2429460	2431860	Is this their grandpa or their dad talking?
2431860	2433300	The TV is Fred.
2433300	2433780	Fred.
2433780	2435060	Which is their dad.
2435060	2435700	That is correct.
2435700	2437460	And Frank is the grandpa?
2437460	2438340	Also correct.
2438340	2439620	And was there only one TV?
2440180	2442180	There's one in the front and one in the back.
2442180	2445060	So yeah, the other one continues to play.
2445060	2446500	He's a soft looking man.
2446500	2452500	His guy says, thank you for coming and experiencing my pride and joy.
2452580	2453700	Grover's gorge.
2453700	2456660	I'm thrilled that you came and joined me on a tour of the future.
2456660	2462260	While you leave, please think very seriously about if you'd like the outside world to mirror
2462260	2464740	this gorge, this little town.
2464740	2469860	Julius looks at the TV and just says, Fred, your children are on board.
2469860	2470420	Please go.
2474660	2477940	Do you want to roll to feel good about this?
2480900	2481700	Can I say no?
2482500	2486500	I got a 99.
2487460	2487960	What?
2488660	2490340	You said roll to feel good about this.
2490340	2492660	So all that happens is that he rolls.
2492660	2495300	Thankfully, either way, it doesn't do anything, you know?
2495300	2497780	I got a 96, but yeah.
2497780	2499460	Don't try to reason with the machine.
2499460	2503540	Fred Godel points his finger into the air and a green light comes on.
2503540	2510100	This one means I'm really looking forward to shaping the world and making it a much
2510100	2511140	better place.
2511140	2516500	And the single simple steel train car begins moving.
2516500	2518580	Hey Julius, are you filming?
2518580	2523700	And Kal, like as those things like start slapping like against the wall while we're slowly
2523700	2526900	pulling away, Kal starts doing the TikTok dance like in their faces.
2528020	2531140	I mean, of course Julius pulls his phone out and films that.
2531140	2538820	As soon as you start filming, the bottom of a jaguar slams onto the side of the window.
2538820	2545460	You see the bottom of its legs scraping as it suddenly disappears and it is on top of
2545460	2548180	this simple single steel train car.
2549060	2550660	We are in dexterity order.
2552020	2554020	Luke, what does Julius Summers do?
2554020	2555140	He continues to film.
2555140	2560820	You hear purring coming from above you and the footsteps traipsing across.
2560820	2566500	And as you get further away from the shore, you can look and see the group waiting on
2566580	2568900	the other side, standing on the shore.
2568900	2570260	The shore of the cliff.
2571620	2572100	Nailed it.
2574740	2575780	Wait, on the other side?
2576500	2577780	The side we just left?
2577780	2579300	Yeah, the side that you just left.
2579300	2580100	I'm with you, Thomas.
2580100	2585860	I thought maybe there was like another group that we were heading towards.
2585860	2588660	Well, I thought there was maybe a spatial switcheroo.
2588660	2589860	There's no spatial switcheroo.
2589860	2591060	Everything is the same on both sides.
2591060	2593140	There's just a leopard on top.
2593140	2596020	Okay, there's just a jaguar on top.
2596100	2597140	Or is it a leopard?
2597140	2599940	Roll biology to know if you can tell the difference.
2602180	2603380	Oh, that's not one of our skills.
2604980	2605940	Science.
2605940	2606420	Bitch.
2606420	2607860	Intelligence at a negative 20.
2611300	2612180	Critical success.
2612180	2612500	Oh!
2614420	2614660	Fail.
2615220	2617620	Julius, Julius, are you getting that jaguar?
2617620	2619940	I'm not going to roll because Julius would have no...
2620580	2625460	He definitely wouldn't be able to distinguish between these two things.
2625460	2626580	Yeah, it's really difficult.
2626580	2632180	However, Cal Colorado confidently says that into your camera.
2632180	2636900	I'm still filming him dance until the TikTok's over.
2636900	2641220	It starts playing that same animation and the voiceover is coming over
2641220	2644500	as Dexterity Order hits Beck Wilder, you're up.
2644500	2648500	Beck is now like a horror movie just filming the ceiling of the train car
2648500	2653620	as he follows the sound of the steps of the paws of the claws of the jaguar.
2653620	2656420	It's seemingly just prowling on top.
2656420	2657380	Back and forth.
2657380	2658180	Back and forth.
2658740	2662740	Dudes, like, when the train stops, we gotta like hold the door closed.
2662740	2664580	Hold on, that gives me an idea.
2664580	2666180	And Cal thinks with all his might,
2666180	2670500	oh, I want to use that critical success biology rule about jaguars
2670500	2673220	to interpret some feline behavior here.
2673220	2674900	Now we're role-playing, baby.
2674900	2677380	Let's interpret some feline behavior.
2677380	2679140	Do these windows open at all?
2679140	2679540	Yes.
2679540	2682900	Quick, everyone, anything shiny you have, gather it all up.
2682900	2684500	I mean, you guys have a ton of equipment,
2684500	2686820	so there's got to be something shiny in that bag.
2686820	2690100	Got the keys to the van, and Beck probably has a huge key ring of bullshit.
2690100	2691140	The keys to the van.
2691140	2694260	Well, I mean, like, we save the key to the van and throw the other key.
2694260	2698020	We don't have a lot of that stuff because we left it in the lockers when we came here.
2698020	2698580	Oh, fuck.
2699140	2700980	But it's where we're going to.
2700980	2705300	I'll use like a lens of a lens I'm not using on my camera,
2705300	2707380	and it can probably reflect some.
2707380	2708420	Yes, that's brilliant.
2708420	2710100	We'll use it as a giant laser pointer.
2710100	2712580	Oh, yeah, dude, I could focus the light through the sun.
2712580	2714500	Through this, and I could point it.
2714500	2715060	Where do you want me to open it?
2715060	2716740	We don't even need to open a window to do that.
2716740	2719060	Just point it near the tracks and see if it jumps off.
2719060	2719540	I do that.
2719540	2720260	I kind of aim it.
2721060	2722740	I'm going to aim it like where we're headed.
2722740	2724260	In front of it, and then, yeah.
2724260	2725780	To see if it'll run it over.
2732100	2734100	Beck is saying, here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
2735060	2741620	Okay, and I'd like you to roll your, like, I think you're using the same skill that you use
2741620	2742580	to film.
2742580	2743300	Yeah, I agree.
2744260	2745140	I thought you might.
2746260	2747140	That's a pass.
2747140	2749940	That's a six on a 80.
2749940	2750500	I failed.
2750500	2751220	Is it critical?
2751220	2753300	It is not critical, but it is a failure.
2753300	2754020	Catacle?
2754020	2755220	That cat loves this.
2755220	2756340	Wait, is that a 96?
2756340	2757300	No, it's a 36.
2757300	2757860	Oh.
2757860	2758740	Cat's not very smart.
2760340	2761940	And loves lasers.
2761940	2766980	And loves lasers at a massive negative percent here because of the lasers.
2766980	2774500	This jaguar jumps in front of the single simple steel train car that you are riding in.
2774500	2780980	And as the single simple steel train car continues on the tracks away from the single
2780980	2784900	simple steel train car, walking nimbly across the tracks.
2784900	2786420	And as it tries to make it.
2789940	2791540	This is not going to be good for the cat.
2791540	2792180	I'll tell you that.
2794500	2795140	What was it?
2795780	2796500	An 88.
2797700	2804020	As it just like crosses right in front of our path, Cal's like, I suddenly feel very
2804020	2804820	bad about this.
2806020	2812740	Julius looks at both of them and is like, I mean, that was probably a human at one point.
2812740	2820100	As you say that, this jaguar makes a jump as it's nimbly walking across the train tracks
2820100	2822420	with you all approaching it.
2822420	2825540	It sees, it must make the leap now.
2825540	2827460	You're coming up right behind it.
2827460	2833700	It jumps for the edge knowing about how far a cliff side might be away from it.
2833700	2840900	However, its claws can normally sink in much easier to maybe a normal cliff or typical
2840900	2841780	mountain side.
2841780	2847700	However, this is an unnaturally smooth cliff side Mufasa.
2847700	2848900	I was about to say Mufasa.
2848900	2861300	And the single simple steeled train car lands on the other seed.
2864420	2870340	Um, I kind of wish we hadn't Mufasa'd that guy, but good, good work, Beck.
2870340	2871220	Well pointed.
2871220	2872180	It was us or him.
2872180	2873940	Maybe he just wanted to talk.
2873940	2884420	The screen, the screen quickly cuts back to for Donald sitting in his green shirt and
2884420	2889220	the Godel company has continued that practice into these modern times.
2889220	2896340	So thank you for opening your eyes, opening your heart and opening your mind to a future
2896340	2898420	without hunger, without pain.
2899140	2902340	Thank you for visiting Grover's gorge.
2902340	2904900	And the doors try to open.
2904900	2911700	You hear this like noise and then they kind of stopped trying to open.
2912340	2915380	And you all remember that they've been like jammed shut.
2915380	2915860	Currently.
2920580	2921940	Are you trying to move quickly?
2921940	2925220	Like what's the, what is the feel within this train car right now?
2925220	2927860	So are those people walking across the bridge or running across it?
2927860	2929540	Or are they just standing on the other platform?
2929540	2931380	Yeah, that's a, what do we see behind us?
2931380	2937940	So you have windows on either side, but there's just a TV screen on the short sides.
2937940	2940100	So then I think we're probably moving quickly.
2940100	2940340	Yeah.
2940340	2943620	Cause you can't see, you can't see, you could lean your head out the window and you see
2943620	2946660	they're not, they're not trying to walk across the train tracks.
2946660	2949380	They're uh, guys, they're just kind of standing there.
2949380	2950260	It's pretty creepy.
2950260	2951540	Actually, Beck, get a shot of this.
2951540	2954500	I stick the camera out the window to get a good angle on it.
2954500	2961140	They are all just staring at you standing in a line wearing their school uniforms.
2961140	2962020	Bloodied.
2962020	2965700	We're sorry about your friend, the Jaguar guy.
2965700	2966660	He slipped.
2966660	2968580	Julius is going to try to open the doors.
2970180	2970980	Yeah, real strength.
2971540	2972340	I'll help him out.
2974020	2974660	I need help.
2976180	2976420	Okay.
2976420	2979860	Everybody Beck, you keep filming, but uh, Stevie, if you could give us a hand here.
2981380	2982340	Oh, pass for me.
2982340	2982740	Pass.
2982740	2983060	Easy.
2985300	2987620	And you're open back up to this other side.
2987620	2988660	You see the big sign.
2988660	2990740	Welcome to Godel's gate to Grover's gorge.
2990740	2996420	You see the lockers and looking across at the other side, you see this group continuing
2996420	2998980	to just stand and stare.
2998980	3002500	If they're not coming for us, we should probably film a little pickup here.
3002500	3005460	Julius also flips them off as he's going at the locker.
3007860	3013860	Beck sets up the tripod and has Cal in frame with them in the background on the other side.
3013860	3015780	Can you get the Godel's gorge sign in there too?
3015780	3016180	Can I?
3016180	3016580	Yeah.
3016580	3022340	And Stevie is dragging Fox Godel from the underarms through the shot and then out of
3022340	3027620	frame coming up on your like stage left on as you're looking out at this picturesque
3027620	3028820	is not the right word, huh?
3029540	3030820	Indelible site.
3030820	3033460	Something you'll probably have a hard time forgetting.
3033460	3039620	I give the five, four, and then a sign that three, two, one.
3039620	3041380	Terror in our own backyards.
3041380	3046900	A news crew kidnapped, brutalized, and the story of our fantastic escape.
3046900	3049460	Tonight on city action news.
3049460	3051940	I'm Cal Colorado signing off.
3052980	3053780	Julius.
3053780	3056660	Julius screams in just joy.
3058180	3058660	Yes!
3071380	3077620	Let's dog those doors.
3077620	3078820	Let's dog those doors.
3078820	3081300	Julius, uh, texts his uncle, we're on the way.
3084260	3085700	As we're like loading up the van.
3085700	3088980	I'm like, Julius, could you, uh, could you show me how to use TikTok?
3088980	3093060	Julius just smiles and like motions for Cal's phone.
3095540	3096900	Cal hands it over with a big grin.
3098580	3099620	He shows you the background.
3099620	3100260	That's my daughter.
3101380	3123860	Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.
