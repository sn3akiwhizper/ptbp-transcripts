0	7360	Greetings, all my wolf pups, it's your radio dad, Wolf the dog, howling at y'all from
7360	11840	Contentions best radio show that is recorded in the basement.
11840	19080	Tell your friends to tune in to 694.2 PTBP for all the goings on in our wonderful little
19080	21600	town.
21600	24880	Now let's dive right into some local news.
24880	31640	Julie Maxwell, back from the dead, kidnapped Leo Piston and took him to Splashylvania.
31640	35800	She shot Leo Piston at the top of the two-fanged plunge.
35800	37920	Officer Clark Bishop was on the scene.
37920	40240	He shot and killed Julie Maxwell.
40240	46320	Your buddy Wolf will now ride the two-fanged plunge with a heavy, heavy heart.
46320	51760	Now it says here the two bodies were slammed into the ground by an unseen force before
51760	52760	disappearing.
52760	55320	That's gotta be wrong, right?
55320	61360	Somebody get Sam and Dean down here because that is some supernatural business.
61360	65560	Officer John Lee Pettymore took a weird picture of the missing John Peters.
65560	71240	If I had a dollar every time someone took a weird picture of me, I'd have zero dollars
71240	77000	because your boy Wolf knows that cameras will steal your soul.
77000	83120	Drew Andrews, upstanding citizen and police station secretary, translated the binary that
83120	84960	the hooded fella gave John.
84960	88720	It said, I killed the chief's pops, John.
88720	93680	Sounds like this hooded boy is up to no good if you ask me.
93680	98080	Keith is in a wheelchair, which is a damn shame because I don't think there's a single
98080	101580	place with a wheelchair ramp in this whole town.
101580	106220	The officers broke into a missing person's property, John Peters' storage units to
106220	110180	be exact, and they found a whole bunch of goodies.
110180	116020	One thing they found was so smelly, they decided not to open it until back in the police station,
116020	118900	which makes total sense, I guess.
118900	123300	They took everything back to the station in a U-Haul truck.
123300	128660	In the plastic trunk, a woman's head, split in half with a small silver sphere in the
128660	132380	middle, sat upon what was likely her own chopped up body.
132380	136020	I'm gonna have to stop reading the news if it's all this fucked up.
136020	139580	Your buddy Wolf is becoming scared of the dark.
139580	143900	Which reminds me, you know, I had a weird dream last night.
143900	150500	In the dream, I was walking my dog, Wolf, and he looked at me, and when he looked at
150500	157780	me, he had my face, and then I looked in a mirror and I had his face.
157780	164300	So anyway, never fear, because Contention's newest band is here with a hot one for y'all.
164300	183580	It's Kudzu with no backbones.
183580	184900	Okay let's do it.
184900	185900	Did you not record that?
185900	189260	What the fuck is wrong with you, Zach?
189260	190260	Every opportunity.
190260	193520	From the top.
193520	195740	It's literally every time something good happens.
195740	200180	Yeah, I was almost like, well maybe we should record soundcheck just in case.
200180	202780	So you admit this is your fault?
202780	203780	No.
203780	204780	You sound weird now.
204780	209060	Yeah, I think we need to go through it all again.
209060	211340	Alright, Joe, if you could test your mic for me.
211340	212340	Oh, no.
212340	213340	I'm just kidding.
213340	214340	Peep up.
214340	216860	So, Christian, before we get started, where's the four-wheeler?
216860	217860	We rode it back to...
217860	219980	I rode it back shirtless to the station.
219980	221380	Yeah, where'd you put it?
221380	222380	Probably in evidence.
222380	225060	I locked it up safely in a jail cell.
225060	226060	Eat it.
226060	230500	There would probably, there probably would be a garage on the premises just for convenience
230500	231500	of cars.
231500	232500	Yeah, like pretty sure.
232500	235060	Or like even for like a stolen car situation where it's like, you know.
235060	236060	Any of that, just a pound?
236060	237060	A lot?
237060	238060	It's an impound.
238060	239060	Impound, yeah.
239060	242540	And how did you move the 478 kilos of cocaine?
242540	243540	In the U-Haul.
243740	246100	And they're now in the evidence locker.
246100	247100	Okay.
247100	248100	478.
248100	249100	Except for one brick.
249100	253740	You guys asked Drew to look into a few things for you, and after you're finished up cataloging
253740	257420	all the items in the evidence room, he gets your attention at his desk.
257420	258420	Hey, fellas!
258420	264220	So, I called the mill on the other side of the city where the chief's dad works, and
264220	265820	they confirmed his passing.
265820	269620	I tried the chief a couple more times, still no response.
269620	272100	I also looked into Cole's orphanage.
272100	274280	I didn't find anything about it.
274280	279460	There seems to be no record of a place called that anywhere around contention.
279460	284860	And then you guys asked me to find a mechanical engineer of some kind for those papers with
284860	286340	the diagrams and scribbles?
286340	290660	Well, I actually happen to have a knack for that kind of thinking, and it seems to me
290660	296180	that those diagrams show at least a dozen methods to sabotage the air brakes of a tractor
296180	297180	trailer truck.
297180	298180	Nice work, Drew.
298180	300000	I go and pat him on the back.
300000	305120	He is so giddy that you've accepted his help.
305120	307320	Uh, yeah, good work, Drew.
307320	308400	I gotta agree.
308400	309400	That's pretty good.
309400	310400	Thank you.
310400	312920	Why are you receptionist at a police department if you know of?
312920	316880	Well, you guys have always called me the receptionist, but I'm more of the office manager around
316880	319000	here is how I like to see myself.
319000	320000	That's good.
320000	321000	That's good for you, Drew.
321000	322800	What do you consider to be the difference?
322800	324880	I like to think that I have a little bit more-
324880	326160	Hey, Drew, you got a call, actually.
326160	327160	Could you get that, buddy?
327160	329600	Drew, I contentioned police department.
330360	332000	It's just me pranking them.
332000	333000	Hello?
333000	337300	God, I wish I could fart into the mic right now.
337300	341480	We should look at surveillance footage from the station to see if we can find out more
341480	344080	about Charles and see if we can't find his plate number.
344080	345080	Oh, yeah, for sure.
345080	349960	So you guys go into the surveillance room.
349960	354360	You would see that Charles arrived in a white Toyota.
354440	360400	Clark, you would recognize that for how drunk he seemed when he came in, he was driving
360400	361840	this car very steadily.
361840	364760	Actually, go ahead and roll human intelligence for me.
364760	365760	Humant.
365760	368240	Because we're setting the podcast in Missouri.
368240	369240	Fail.
369240	370240	50 on a 30.
370240	371240	Okay.
371240	373240	Everybody gets a plus 20 drive.
373240	375240	What a drink.
379440	383320	The contentioned police department wishes you to know that we do not condone drinking
383320	384320	or driving?
384320	385320	Absolutely not.
385320	390000	Contention doesn't have Uber, but everybody has a friend, except for Clark Bishop.
390000	391000	Oh.
391000	392000	Oh.
392000	396840	Wasn't it a white Toyota that Mildred saw?
396840	397840	Fuck, I think it was.
397840	398840	That would make sense.
398840	401840	So do you think it was him that loaded up the trunk and all that stuff?
401840	403960	We should definitely find out about this guy.
403960	408520	He seemed to, oh, I was going to say he seemed to genuinely want to find his friend, but
408520	411600	I guess he could have just been playing up only to get the keys.
411600	412600	That's true.
412600	413600	Or maybe both.
414000	417400	I smelled the, this is Joe talking, I smelled the liquor on him, didn't I?
417400	418400	Yes.
418400	420280	He cleverly poured liquor all over himself.
420280	421600	Let's go find him.
421600	422600	Did we get a plate?
422600	423600	Yeah, sure.
423600	424600	I want to run it.
424600	425600	Okay.
425600	426600	Run them plates fast, run them, run them.
426600	427600	Those plates don't exist.
427600	428600	Dang.
428600	429600	Clever girl.
429600	430600	Does anyone we know know about Charles?
430600	432840	He probably lives here if he's friends with John Peters.
432840	434240	I didn't recognize him.
434240	435360	Did I know John at all?
435360	436360	Nope.
436360	439280	What does a Google search for John Peters contention come up with?
439280	441540	Some pretty weird porn.
441540	443780	Go ahead and roll computer science for me.
443780	444780	I've got a decent one.
444780	445780	It's a crit fail.
445780	446780	Oh, I thought it was good.
446780	447780	22 on a 20.
447780	448780	His laptop battery explodes.
448780	449780	You guys know how to use computers.
449780	450780	Oh, the worst crit fail.
450780	451780	Oh, no.
451780	452780	100.
452780	453780	Somebody is hacking.
453780	454780	As you search through, it seems like you hit some pages.
454780	455780	Oh, no.
455780	456780	Oh, no.
456780	457780	Oh, no.
457780	458780	Oh, no.
458780	459780	Oh, no.
459780	460780	Oh, no.
460780	461780	Oh, no.
461780	462780	Oh, no.
462780	463780	Oh, no.
463780	464780	Oh, no.
464780	465780	Oh, no.
465780	466780	Oh, no.
466780	467780	Oh, no.
467780	468780	Oh, no.
468780	475700	So, it seems like you hit some pages that might have existed at one point but no longer
475700	476700	exist.
476700	477700	Clark, you know anything about computers?
477700	478700	No.
478700	479700	That's a younger man's game.
479700	480700	How old are you?
480700	481700	35.
481700	482700	He's an old 35.
482700	483700	I, unfortunately, have zero.
483700	493820	Maybe we should just drive around and see if we see a white Toyota anywhere.
493820	494820	I'm down.
494860	499100	So, the plate not existing doesn't mean we can't put out an APB for the plate on the
499100	500100	car.
500100	501100	That's true.
501100	502100	Very true.
502100	503100	Yeah.
503100	504100	We'll do that.
504100	505100	All points.
505100	506100	Bulletin.
506100	512740	Police work, please roll law.
512740	514400	I put that out so fast.
514400	515400	Me too.
515400	520380	You put out an accurate APB for a white Toyota with the plates that you have seen on this
520380	522580	car in security footage.
522580	523580	What do you want to do next?
524340	526700	I mean, we can still drive around and look for it.
526700	527700	Well.
527700	528700	Or we could go...
528700	529700	We found that...
529700	533300	What, do we have a bunch of other leads to follow or something?
533300	537780	We have this note here that says, the cabin is in the woods stark west from the end of
537780	540580	the trail about two and a half miles signed by Kay.
540580	545260	But when I was riding around with the homeless people yesterday, they were driving down like
545260	546260	a dirt road.
546260	547820	I don't know if you'd call it a trail.
547820	550820	Kathy is the name of the piston wife.
550820	552860	There's some dirt roads and trails around there.
553140	554740	We could walk around in the woods a little bit.
554740	557780	You want to gear up with some of the goodies we got yesterday?
557780	558780	I think we should.
558780	560860	Also, aren't there some woods?
560860	567460	So the piston farm is in the southeast part of town and the far east part of the piston
567460	573340	pig farm is where that trail that the school bus took with Keith Vigna in the back of it.
573340	577420	And it leads off to some old unused country roads back there.
577420	583620	There's also a place called the woods on the map, which is the woods of contention.
583620	585420	It is on the far southwest.
585420	587820	Okay, so let me go back.
587820	591900	Yeah, so we found this note that says the cabin is in the woods stark west from the
591900	594060	end of the trail about two and a half miles.
594060	597180	I know that the woods are down in the southwest part of town.
597180	600620	Would that be that trail you went down the other day with Kathy Piston?
600620	603420	It would not be, because that was over on the southeast side of town.
603420	605780	Well no, it's stark west two and a half miles from the trail.
605780	607220	So if that's the end of her trail...
607220	608780	That could be true.
608780	610360	Let's check it out.
610360	614060	Before we leave, we're on like day three of the chief being missing.
614060	617180	So we would probably put out a bulletin for her now, right?
617180	619740	Did nobody do that?
619740	622980	Drew is like, oh, I've been looking tirelessly.
622980	626380	I already told the city PD to be looking for her.
626380	627380	I yeah.
627380	628380	Good work Drew.
628380	633020	He's not spending all his hours like putting up signs after work.
633020	634820	He is a dedicated civil servant.
634820	635820	We don't deserve him.
635820	636820	Okay.
636820	637820	Should we check that out then?
637820	638820	Somebody push me.
638820	639820	Oh yeah.
639820	641980	Can we give him the four wheeler?
641980	642980	Yeah.
642980	644540	Let's take the four wheeler out.
644540	645540	Yeah.
645540	646540	Yeah.
646540	647540	Yep.
647540	648540	Awesome.
648540	653020	And we are riding on either like wheel hub with shotguns just like propped up against
653020	654020	our fucking knees.
654020	655020	Yeah.
655020	656020	It looks great.
656020	658020	So you guys start rolling through town.
658020	661340	I take my shirt off.
661340	662340	In December.
662340	663340	No.
663340	664340	You guys ride together.
664340	667340	I take the car and I have the trunk full of all the things we might need.
667340	668540	Hell yeah.
668540	669540	What would those things be?
669540	670540	You know, some of the same.
670540	671540	We'll figure out when we get there.
671540	674640	Sounds good.
674640	676780	Just maybe a quick overview.
676780	678380	Some guns and my drone.
678380	679380	Perfect.
679380	680380	Maybe a grenade.
680380	681380	Just the one.
681380	682380	Just one grenade.
682380	685580	An assortment of guns for any conceivable scenario.
685580	686740	Love it.
686740	690460	I love that.
690460	693380	I'm a pretty easy going game master.
693420	695620	I'm a pretty gentle handler.
695620	698060	Well, I'll say.
698060	699060	I'm a soft handler.
699060	700060	Okay.
700060	706200	So you guys make it out to the woods and you can park at the trailhead or you can actually
706200	710300	park off the side of one of those country roads out there, which is actually closer
710300	714660	to the X on the spot, but then you'll have to go through the woods themselves.
714660	717580	I think we should go on the trip, park next to the trail and then we all ride the four
717580	718580	wheeler down the trail.
718580	719580	Okay.
719580	720580	Okay.
720580	721580	Perfect.
721780	723780	So you guys are riding down the trail.
723780	724980	Guys, take your shoes off.
724980	725980	Keep my shirt on.
725980	726980	I keep it on.
726980	727980	Whatever.
727980	728980	You pass.
728980	730500	I flex a little bit.
730500	734180	Every single time you guys pass a group of people, John Lee Pettymore is flexing up.
734180	736580	Puts his sunglasses down over his head.
736580	740060	Do you normally keep your sunglasses on the back of your head?
740060	743660	John Lee Pettymore absolutely keeps his aviators.
743660	746580	No, his tactical Oakleys.
746580	748780	Yeah, absolutely.
748780	751380	It's not even really bright out today, but they're nice.
752180	753180	Yeah.
753180	757480	So you may get down to the part of the trail where the X is.
757480	762420	Is it called the trail butt or the trail because there's a trail head that starts the trail
762420	763420	tail.
763420	764420	What is the trail tail?
764420	765420	The trail tail.
765420	771860	So you guys get to the trail tail and it is a, it's a really serene view.
771860	777460	It's a slight overlook, but the steepness is not vast.
777460	779860	That doesn't make any fucking sense.
779860	781240	It's just a really nice view.
782100	783100	People come out here all the time.
783100	788560	There's an, there's a bench that sits here and there's a few picnic tables and such around
788560	789560	the area.
789560	791500	People camp out here every once in a while.
791500	792680	There's a few spots for that.
792680	795960	A few fire pits and such around the area.
795960	796960	It's really nice.
796960	797960	Okay.
797960	801080	I whip my phone out and I see where West is.
801080	802080	Let's go that way.
802080	803080	Okay.
803080	804080	Can we take the four wheeler through this?
804080	806420	It's an ATV all terrain vehicle.
806420	809520	It's an all terrain vehicle.
809520	810520	And this.
810640	811640	What's it altering?
811640	812640	This is terrain.
812640	813640	Okay.
813640	819680	Let's, let's guys hop, hop back on and go two and a half miles stark West.
819680	820680	Yeah.
820680	821680	Cue up the ATVs.
821680	833960	Cut back to, uh, 20 minutes ago when I was on a prank phone call with Andy, Jesus Christ.
833960	834960	That was totally.
834960	835960	Oh boy.
835960	836960	Yeah.
836960	837960	Listeners love me.
837960	838960	Honestly.
838960	839960	Pretty good at it.
840400	841400	I always forget.
841400	844400	You got to talk into it.
844400	845400	Yeah.
845400	846400	It smells now.
846400	847400	It's a fart mic.
847400	848400	Yeah.
848400	849400	You did that.
849400	850400	That's for yourself.
850400	851400	That's okay.
851400	852400	That's why it really hurts.
852400	855120	You and no one else.
855120	860680	You come upon a clearing in the midst of the thick woods that is roughly 30 yards wide
860680	862700	and 20 yards deep.
862700	868880	The ground in this clearing is black and covered in rotted chard wood.
868880	873160	Looks like there was a cabin here once I want to go up to the wood and take a peek
873160	874160	around.
874160	875160	Same.
875160	879100	Just kind of milling around in the carnage or the charge.
879100	880100	The Charnage.
880100	882920	I'm going to search.
882920	883920	Let's roll.
883920	889020	I was meaning to ask you guys, uh, when we have the roles that all three of you would
889020	891680	be rolling, I would be all three of you.
891680	898400	I think the mechanic system calls for if it is a check like search where the more people
898440	902440	the better than the person with the best score roles for the group.
902440	910240	And if it's something like stealth where it's everybody needs to be, yeah, well then the
910240	913720	worst person roles for the group.
913720	915800	That's just what the mechanic system is for Delta Green.
915800	916800	Just want to throw that out.
916800	920440	I would, I would say situationally though, if we're like far apart and somebody, well
920440	924520	for sure, but if the three of you were side by side, I like it and that's how we've always
924520	925520	played pretty much right?
925520	926520	Pretty much.
926840	931720	While we've been recording this, I've been far more consumed with making sure the story
931720	934560	is right than whether we're playing the game correctly.
934560	936660	Yeah, you got a lot of names in here, buddy.
936660	938760	There's so many names.
938760	939760	Who has the best search?
939760	940760	Not me.
940760	941760	Not me.
941760	942760	And John, did you pass?
942760	943760	Yes.
943760	947960	As you guys are milling about the area, you would see there, there are no bits of structure
947960	949600	that are still standing.
949600	954440	However, it is very clear that at one point in time there was a cabin here.
954440	955480	It burned down.
955520	958080	The remains have been basically untouched.
958080	964640	No one's been out here since it happened, it looks like, and John, you hear a crack
964640	968600	about 20 yards into the thick of the woods.
968600	973000	So shotgun level, but I'm peering straight in and focusing all my attention on that and
973000	976080	I kind of snap and whistle to the other guys.
976080	977080	What's going on, John?
977080	979520	I hold a finger to my lips and point at where I heard the sound.
979520	983120	When I see that, I go ahead and ready mine and I get my fucking, I should have named
983120	987840	this gun my regular, tiny, super powerful gun.
987840	992800	I kind of start backing like maybe towards some cover, like the ATV or whatever, but
992800	1000400	I say, identify yourself, silence, looking into the woods.
1000400	1001400	You see no movement.
1001400	1002400	Okay.
1002400	1003760	I'm going to start walking towards where I heard the sound.
1003760	1007480	I'm covering, covering him like a, like a good police boy.
1007480	1008480	I don't know.
1008480	1010480	Did it sound like a snap twig?
1010480	1011480	A okay.
1011640	1013600	Probably just an animal, but I'm going to go check it out.
1013600	1016460	Are the two of you following behind John?
1016460	1017600	Should somebody maybe stay behind?
1017600	1022000	Here, I'll stay behind cause I'm in a wheelchair or actually I'm on an ATV I guess, but I can't
1022000	1023000	really walk that well.
1023000	1024000	Yeah.
1024000	1026840	I would say, yeah, Keith is definitely still just sitting like at the edge.
1026840	1028280	We are playing a fantasy game.
1028280	1029280	You're right now.
1029280	1030280	A centaur.
1030280	1037720	Keith is definitely like at the edge of the clearing or sitting, sitting on the four wheeler
1037760	1041560	and boom, you see a man just start running.
1041560	1044400	He's sprinting back through the woods away from you.
1044400	1049860	I shout at Keith on the four wheeler and like point to where I saw it and I take off straight
1049860	1050860	after him.
1050860	1051860	Can I see the figure?
1051860	1052860	Yeah.
1052860	1053860	Yeah.
1053860	1054860	He's out in the open now.
1054860	1055860	He is running.
1055860	1056860	It's a tall lanky dude.
1056860	1060040	No, he's running away from you into the woods.
1060040	1061040	But he's in the open.
1061040	1062040	He's just visible.
1062040	1063760	So you can just see him because he's not hiding anymore.
1063760	1066880	I want to do my best to go straight at him on the ATV.
1067200	1068200	You rub, shout and stop.
1068200	1072280	And if you, if John is taking a beeline to the guy, I'm actually kind of going more toward
1072280	1074720	where he was hiding originally.
1074720	1078760	I'm still kind of in pursuit, but taking the path that the guy would have taken.
1078760	1079760	You know what I mean?
1079760	1083680	You're going to center ball him for me.
1083680	1088600	I need, um, I need John and Clark to both roll athletics for me.
1088600	1089600	Pass.
1089600	1091800	28 on a 50.
1091800	1092800	Fail.
1092800	1094120	67 on a 30.
1094120	1095120	Okay.
1095120	1096120	And I need Keith.
1096360	1099360	He's going to do a literal drive for me.
1099360	1100360	Oh my god.
1100360	1101360	I'm fucking 99.
1101360	1102360	Oh!
1102360	1103360	Hell yes.
1103360	1108000	The engine falls out.
1108000	1112840	Clark as you begin running into the woods, the brush is hitting you and you're trying
1112840	1118880	to fight through it, but you are not in shape and you are not in a position to be chasing
1118880	1125120	after someone in this kind of terrain because you're not an all terrain man and you start
1125120	1131560	falling behind, but you see John ahead of you and he is just fighting through this brush,
1131560	1135440	just going hard, just running as fast as he can straight towards this guy who's running
1135440	1136440	away from you.
1136440	1143080	And you notice Keith flying past you in a four wheeler and smashed directly into a large
1143080	1145080	tree.
1145080	1151360	Keith, if you want to roll a D6 for me.
1151360	1153440	It completely fucks up his other foot.
1153440	1154760	It's a four.
1154760	1156920	I need you to take four damage.
1156920	1164840	Keith, as you drive into the tree, you brace with your feet and your left ankle that is
1164840	1171600	completely swollen and wrapped probably in a boot snaps and you feel your ankle as you
1171600	1173560	hear it crunch.
1173560	1176280	Oh no.
1176280	1183160	Leasing up my good foot.
1183160	1184920	John, you're still in pursuit.
1184920	1188440	Go ahead and roll another athletics check for me.
1188440	1190080	Are we competing now?
1190080	1193320	Oh, I failed my roll.
1193320	1194320	He failed as well.
1194320	1195320	I rolled 54.
1195320	1197440	You don't catch up to him at all.
1197440	1202480	You guys are both still running through, so go ahead and make another roll for me.
1202480	1204160	Oh, fuck.
1204160	1205160	100.
1205160	1206160	Good fail.
1206160	1208320	Absolutely delightful.
1208320	1214320	You turn around as you hear a crash from behind you and you see Keith crash into a tree and
1214320	1218640	as soon as you turn back around, a branch comes out of nowhere.
1218640	1219640	What's it called?
1219640	1220640	Clothesline.
1220640	1221640	Yeah.
1221640	1223480	You get clotheslined by a pretty hefty branch.
1223480	1227000	Go ahead and roll a D4 for me.
1227000	1228000	Three.
1228000	1236280	Take three damage as you fall flat on your back and the figure runs off into the distance.
1236280	1238720	I want to try to fire at it if I can.
1238720	1242400	Take your damage real quick and then roll firearms at negative 40.
1242400	1243400	Cool.
1243400	1247640	39 on a...
1247640	1249600	Adjusted on a 20.
1249600	1252200	So you fire a couple of times into the woods.
1252200	1253600	Clark, what do you want to do?
1253600	1255840	So I'm probably coming up on the ATV at this point.
1255840	1256840	Yeah.
1256840	1257840	I'm seeing how I can help that.
1257840	1263400	I hold my leg up and it's just my foot's just kind of flopping around.
1263400	1265400	Oh shit.
1265400	1267360	Oh Keith, can you feel that?
1267360	1269040	I'm kind of in shock right now.
1269040	1270240	Yeah, I bet, bud.
1270240	1271680	I can tell it's going to hurt.
1271680	1274160	I'm lifting him up and trying to get him onto the ATV.
1274160	1276600	Yeah, you can pick him up and get him on there.
1276600	1277600	Maybe you should drive.
1277600	1278600	I don't know if I...
1278600	1282200	I'm trying to put him back into the driver's seat.
1282200	1286160	Get out of here, Keith.
1286160	1290360	The ATV is now quite wonky as you drive him back.
1290360	1291360	It's like wobbling.
1291360	1292360	Yeah.
1292360	1293360	It's real hard.
1293360	1294360	Wiggling back and forth.
1294960	1301760	At the first person we pass back on the trail, John very shamefully puts his shirt back on.
1301760	1304200	Sad, John.
1304200	1310960	Before we head out, is there any way we can go to see where he was running and track him?
1310960	1314640	Yeah, I was going to see if I could find any, if he tore his clothing on anything, especially
1314640	1315640	where he was hiding.
1315640	1317200	I was wondering if he had been there for a while.
1317200	1318200	There's no tracking.
1318200	1319200	Would that be-
1319200	1320200	Survival.
1320200	1321200	Survival?
1321200	1322200	Man, I didn't think that would be that useful.
1322200	1323200	Okay.
1324040	1325040	I pass.
1325040	1326040	35 on a 60.
1326040	1327040	Oh, do you have a dope survival?
1327040	1328040	Awesome.
1328040	1329040	I do not pass.
1329040	1331040	I die.
1331040	1332840	You fail surviving.
1332840	1339440	Clark, as you look about, you find the exact large branch that had fallen on the ground
1339440	1343600	that this person had stepped on to make that loud crack.
1343600	1349000	And it doesn't really, it was kind of behind a pretty big log, which you think he then
1349000	1352960	immediately hit the ground to hide behind before taking off.
1352960	1354480	Do I see any-
1354480	1357560	There are no signs that he was there for some time or anything.
1357560	1358560	Racking our memories.
1358560	1363600	Does this guy share a frame or any physical characteristics with anybody we know from
1363600	1364600	town?
1364600	1369560	I think based on how shitty all those roles were, you guys were just in the panic mode
1369560	1370560	and had-
1370560	1373320	We might have been chasing our own shadows for all we know.
1373320	1374840	You saw a flash of human.
1374840	1376760	Dude, good band name.
1376760	1377760	Flash of human?
1377760	1378760	Oh, yeah.
1378760	1379760	Oh, man.
1379760	1382760	In World, flash of human is Johnny Paymore's favorite band.
1382760	1383760	They were his mom's favorite band.
1383760	1385560	What do you think that fella was watching us for?
1385560	1388600	I don't know if he was watching us or if we spooked him.
1388600	1389600	Why do you-
1389600	1391600	Why was he out here though?
1391600	1397920	I'm starting to think something funny is going on in contention.
1397920	1401880	Yeah, you guys could have gotten some information there.
1401880	1402880	Yeah.
1402880	1403880	Fuck.
1403880	1409840	I don't know about you guys, but this to me seems like perhaps a seriously blown opportunity.
1409840	1410840	Yup.
1410840	1414640	Yeah, you guys really fucked that up.
1414640	1416120	Oh, that sucks.
1416120	1419760	Well, let's go check out that orphanage I guess.
1419760	1423240	You ever feel like you're just throwing the dice in life and it's not coming up?
1423240	1427520	If the guy had kept running in a straight line, would I know where he would potentially
1427520	1428520	come out?
1428520	1430480	That's what I thought we were tracking him for, right?
1430480	1437640	Yeah, and based on that, the woods, quote unquote, is an extremely large area, but it
1437640	1438640	is-
1438640	1439640	Get your drone out.
1439640	1440640	Yes.
1440640	1441640	Good idea.
1441640	1442640	It is surrounded-
1442640	1443640	Fuck you, Game Master.
1443640	1444640	Bye.
1444640	1448040	It is surrounded by roads.
1448040	1449040	Great.
1449040	1450040	Great idea, Keith.
1450040	1451040	Yeah.
1451040	1452040	And I'm good.
1452040	1453040	Of where?
1453040	1454040	In his backpack.
1454040	1455040	It was in my backpack.
1455040	1456040	No, it wasn't.
1456040	1458200	It's the ATV's little buddy.
1458200	1460040	The ATV still drives though, right?
1460040	1461040	It's just wonky.
1461040	1462040	It's just wonky.
1462040	1463040	Let's get back-
1463040	1464520	As quick as possible back to there.
1464520	1465520	Who's driving the ATV?
1465520	1466520	Not me.
1466520	1467520	I'll drive.
1467520	1468520	I've got a good drive.
1468520	1469520	I did just get fucked up.
1469520	1470520	Yeah.
1470520	1471520	Drive at negative 20 for me.
1471520	1472520	Nice.
1472520	1473520	Oh.
1473520	1476960	Perhaps out of anger at his recent failures, perhaps out of just a desire to prove something
1476960	1478360	to his dead daddy.
1478360	1483560	I don't know what inspires John Boehner's foot or John Lee Pennymore.
1483560	1485560	Whoops.
1486560	1489560	I mean.
1489560	1490560	Jesus, Thomas.
1490560	1496560	Either way, nobody has ever driven an ATV down a dirt track better than you see an ATV
1496560	1497800	driven right the fuck now.
1497800	1499560	It's not like a one, but it is a six.
1499560	1500560	Okay.
1500560	1501560	Yeah.
1501560	1508080	You drive rather quickly back to the trailhead and make it to your cruiser, which has the
1508080	1509880	drone in the back.
1509880	1511480	I pop that sucker out.
1511480	1516200	I set the little screen on the trunk and I start flying that bad boy.
1516200	1517200	Okay.
1517200	1521240	Go ahead and roll computer science for me.
1521240	1522240	Damn it.
1522240	1523240	I've got zero on that.
1523240	1524240	Here.
1524240	1525240	How about you-
1525240	1526240	No.
1526240	1527240	I'll give it.
1527240	1528240	I can give it a try.
1528240	1529240	I think Clark is going to give it a go for a minute.
1529240	1530240	Well, yeah.
1530240	1531240	I mean-
1531240	1534320	Before, as you're driving it, the two of you are watching his screen.
1534320	1540560	I am very determined and clear headed as I guide it upward about 10 feet.
1540560	1541560	It's above us.
1541560	1545440	We're all looking at it and then it just falls.
1545440	1547600	Doesn't do anything.
1547600	1549120	Go ahead and make a roll for me.
1549120	1550120	Yeah.
1550120	1551120	He has zero.
1551120	1552120	44.
1552120	1553120	Fuck.
1553120	1554120	Yeah.
1554120	1555120	That's a crit fail.
1555120	1556120	Wait, wait, wait.
1556120	1557120	Okay.
1557120	1558120	But how can he even roll with zero?
1558120	1559120	All he can do is-
1559120	1562320	To see whether he crit failed is literally why I had him roll.
1562320	1564600	Can you roll on a skill you don't have though?
1564600	1567840	Because you could crit fail instead of just fail.
1567840	1570720	I had Luke do the same thing on forensics, I think.
1570720	1572960	I think maybe there's a base of 20 on that or something.
1572960	1573960	No, there's a zero.
1573960	1574960	Yeah.
1574960	1575960	Okay.
1575960	1576960	So it adds up.
1576960	1577960	I've done this before.
1577960	1583720	Clark, as you begin flying the drone above you, you lose control of it and it dips down
1583720	1586920	and- I'm going to roll real quick.
1586920	1587920	Off my list.
1587920	1591800	My D20 with a list of possible outcomes for a drone failure.
1591800	1598600	Clark, the drone out of your control, but technically in your control comes flying directly
1598600	1599600	at you.
1599600	1601720	And I try and dodge it.
1601720	1604560	Go ahead and roll dodge for me.
1604560	1606560	Fail.
1606560	1608560	It hits you directly in the chest.
1608560	1611240	Oh, in the chest?
1611240	1612240	Yeah.
1612240	1620120	Now, guys, I don't actually know anything about drones based on what you've been imagining.
1620120	1621120	How bad would this hurt?
1621120	1622120	Probably pretty fucking.
1622120	1625420	I'm imagining a pretty medium to large sized drone.
1625420	1628080	If it's going speedily, it probably doesn't feel great.
1628080	1630960	Okay, go ahead and roll a D4 for me.
1630960	1631960	Four.
1631960	1635600	Yeah, you lose four damage.
1635600	1636900	Like it shatters his collarbone.
1636900	1638800	I'm looking up, here's what happens when a drone-
1638800	1642720	It knocks you to the ground and cuts you up in the chest.
1642720	1648240	And you get knocked to the ground and one of its propellers is caught in your uniform.
1648240	1650120	Oh, fuck.
1650120	1653600	We just watched a video where drone blades flew into pig flesh.
1653600	1654600	Let's see.
1654600	1655600	Did it go into it?
1655600	1658400	It didn't cut it up, but it stabbed a good three inches.
1658400	1660160	That's also an unshielded blade though.
1660160	1661160	Yeah.
1661160	1662160	Okay.
1662160	1663160	Which these are all pretty much contained.
1663160	1664160	That's true, actually.
1664160	1665160	At least surrounded.
1665160	1666160	Yeah.
1666160	1667160	And it broke off inside of it, too.
1667160	1668160	Oh, damn.
1668160	1671480	I will say it cut your chest up pretty bad and knocked you back to the ground.
1671480	1674860	And the drone falls to the ground next to you on the ground.
1674860	1678640	You would all see that the propellers are massively screwed up.
1678640	1680120	And being a cop is hard.
1680120	1681120	Fuck.
1681120	1684600	Dude, are you- Here, I want to first aid him.
1684600	1685600	Oh, okay.
1685600	1692080	We got a 61 on a 60.
1692080	1698480	Luke off mic just shook his head and looked at Joe and shrugged his head.
1698480	1701960	Luke, you go looking through the police cruiser for-
1701960	1702960	Keith.
1702960	1705280	Keith, you go looking through the police cruiser- Thank you.
1705280	1710480	... for a first aid kit of some sort and you guys did not bring one with you today.
1710480	1714840	It's bizarre because normally there's one already in there.
1714840	1716520	We had to make room for the guns.
1716520	1721320	Some drunk cut his forehead open in the back and we had to patch him up and forgot to resupply.
1721320	1722640	That's usually Tim's job.
1722640	1725120	I'd pull off my uniform- Hell, yeah.
1725120	1729680	... and then tie it around me very bra-like around my chest.
1729680	1733080	That's incredible.
1733080	1734080	What do you guys want to do now?
1734080	1735080	Oh, man.
1735080	1736520	That you have failed literally everything?
1736520	1739880	Well, I'd like to try to fly the drone if it's not broken.
1739880	1744840	It is in such disrepair that flying it would be extremely difficult.
1744840	1748560	I've got drone repair.
1748560	1749960	That's super handy.
1749960	1753120	In this edition, it's repair drone.
1753120	1761000	Oh, man, guys- Yeah, Keith starts crying because of his failures
1761000	1764880	and because my leg is starting to hurt extremely bad.
1764880	1765880	Yeah.
1765880	1769120	I'm going to go to the- John starts crying too.
1769120	1775240	I'm going to go to the hospital the second day in a row.
1775240	1776840	For the same foot.
1776840	1781640	The camera pans out and begins to lift on the scene and does an aerial shot-
1781640	1783520	A well executed drone shot.
1783520	1790320	A beautifully executed drone shot of the three of you sitting on the ground next to the police
1790320	1793040	cruiser all crying.
1793040	1797200	I got to call my mom.
1797200	1799200	Can we take a break?
1799200	1802280	Yeah, we can take a break.
1802280	1803280	Oh, God.
1803280	1804280	Jesus Christ.
1804280	1805280	Oh, my God.
1805280	1806280	That was amazing.
1806280	1810600	That was the most Three Stooges things I think we've ever done.
1810600	1814520	We were hitting branches and flying drones into us.
1814520	1819440	I just dropped straight on the first tree.
1819440	1826440	We literally just were knocking ourselves out.
1826440	1828440	So what the fuck do we do now?
1849440	1877440	Oh, my God.
1877440	1905440	Oh, my God.
1905440	1934440	Oh, my God.
1934440	1962440	Oh, my God.
1962440	1991440	Oh, my God.
1992440	1998840	Greetings, my greasy grandkids.
1998840	2004760	It's your grease granddad Wolf, the dog, and I'm here to let you all know that you can
2004760	2009760	support this show and help it grow with some of that hard-earned dough.
2009760	2016800	Yeah, you know that rhyme was so nice, I said it twice and make sure you go over to patreon.com
2016800	2018760	slash pretending pod.
2018760	2021960	The link is in the damn show notes, babies.
2021960	2024720	Thanks for listening, my bacon buddies.
