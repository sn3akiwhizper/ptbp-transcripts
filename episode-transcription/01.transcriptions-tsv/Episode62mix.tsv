0	14160	Oh, I didn't see you there my babies, come on in.
14160	21080	I was just reading this amazing book by a bright new genius author called Finding Your
21080	29760	Inner Clam Gravy, Diving Through This Dumpster We Call Life, written by me, Wolf the Dog.
29760	37920	It's an autobiography by me, Wolf the Dog, about me, Wolf the Dog, I'll probably never
37920	39460	release it though.
39460	45800	This book holds far too much knowledge and power, but then again, money does let a dog
45800	51120	get closer to his dream of opening a trash can centric theme park.
51120	58240	Speaking of trash, this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from jdg222 on Instagram, who wrote
58240	65560	a 5-star review on iTunes, which is apparently a great way to help guide my dulcet tones
65560	71500	into ears that have not yet had my pleasure, mmm delicious.
71500	78200	Jeff writes, If Wolf could give a shout out to my companions at The Traveler's Path, that
78200	79760	would be amazing.
79760	82400	They've been with me through thick and thin.
82400	86080	Our handler Alan has given us weeks of adventure.
86080	89560	My friends have become brothers and sisters in arms.
89560	92840	I can't wait to share more adventures with them.
92840	102000	Aaron, Bob, Justin, Willis, Nick, Connor, Victoria, Emma, and Tony, I love you guys
102000	104440	and will see you next session.
104440	113520	Now I most certainly will not give a shout out to Aaron, Bob, Justin, Willis, Nick,
113520	120920	Connor, Victoria, Emma, and Tony, there's just no way you can make me do it.
120920	125040	Never in a million years, Jeff from Instagram.
125040	131080	I appreciate you writing though, even if I definitely did not honor your request.
131080	135680	Remember, if you want to write up something for your Walter Hal, tag at PretendingPod

176400	179120	of our dear honorary police officers.
179120	184980	A big difference between contention police officers and our honorary police officers
184980	192100	over on patreon is Wolf the dog loves his honorary police officers.
192100	197160	Wolf the dog ain't never been hassled while diving snout first into a dumpster filled
197160	203460	with wet sloppy Mississippi roast by one of his honorary police officers.
203460	207920	Jesus, last time was grievous.
207920	214880	The reason for the season is seemingly malfeasance for the sake of convenience.
214880	219360	Given credence to the frequently indecent, it's time for the news.
219360	224640	This segment of the news comes in the form of a multiple choice question.
224640	231320	The question is this, if someone begins chanting and you would like them to stop, you should
231320	232320	a.
232320	234640	Ask them to stop b.
234640	237300	Cover the mouth c.
237300	244240	Use that cool gun Leon had that Clark is holding which knocks people unconscious or d.
244240	246680	Immediately shoot them.
246680	247920	If you answer d.
247920	252120	You might be a contention police officer.
252120	253260	Everyone is dead.
253260	255160	So let's spread some dread.
255160	261200	I got something around here that will fit this somber mood orgastically.
261200	266400	It's kudzu with no backbone.
291200	301160	Do you have your car back yet?
301160	302160	Are we recording?
302160	305160	We're always recording.
305160	312500	I woke myself and my girlfriend up in the middle of the night screaming Luke no because
312500	318560	I was having a dream where I was riding shotgun with you and we were having this discussion
318560	322960	and we were trying to prove points on our phones or whatever basically and you got super
322960	330200	distracted from driving and I noticed I look up and I see this young woman in the middle
330200	334640	of the road right in front of us that you're about to just plow over and I screamed Luke
334640	341040	no in real life and woke myself and my girlfriend and the cats up.
341040	342040	What did she look like?
342040	344080	She was wearing a white dress.
344080	345880	I bet that symbolizes something.
345880	350400	Well I did recently murder somebody but just not with my car.
350400	351760	It's weird that there was a car in the dream.
351760	355240	I was driving a van so it's totally different.
355240	356360	Luke what was she wearing?
356360	363240	Oh I don't know I was in a blind fury so I don't remember.
363240	366560	I only see her face when I close my eyes.
366560	370840	She just looked like my dad.
370840	374760	Luke I thought your new year's resolution was to not murder anyone this year.
374760	377760	Well you know how new year's resolutions go.
377760	379660	By the wayside quickly.
379660	382160	Did anyone else make any new year's resolutions?
382160	383840	I never do and I didn't.
383840	386640	Hey Kameel good job.
386640	390000	Perfect as it is.
390000	391000	Justin?
391000	395240	Oh I got way too many rezzies when I get fit-ish not like jacked.
395240	396240	Go Kameel.
396240	397240	Not like Zach.
397240	403080	I don't want to be as fit as Zach.
403080	407200	For the listeners who don't know Zach is just fucking ripped.
407200	409200	Just pumping iron.
409200	415480	Honestly when I stand next to Zach it's like Kevin Hart standing next to The Rock.
415480	416480	That is true.
416480	417480	A lot like that.
417480	424360	The other day I went into work and one of my fellow co-workers who does go to the gym
424360	430160	greeted me by grabbing my bicep and then immediately looked me in the eyes and said did I just
430160	433720	touch bone on both sides?
433720	434720	Did he?
434720	435720	Oh yeah he got bone baby.
435720	436720	What do you mean?
436720	438040	Of course you can do that.
438040	439040	Who was it?
439040	440040	It was Phil.
440040	441040	Doxum.
441040	442040	There's no way I could feel bone in his arm.
442040	445520	Well it's a good thing because I didn't feel emasculated at all.
445520	446520	So it makes sense.
446520	449040	I felt really normal about it.
449040	457680	Oh no you can't feel bone you're... it's too much fat.
457680	459480	Thomas was just groping me that whole time.
459480	463840	A few weeks ago I was talking to Phil I forget where we were but I was talking to him.
463840	467720	I was just saying like yeah the first time I met you I knew you were going to be a douchebag
467720	470680	and then like you weren't and it's crazy to me still.
470680	472120	You said that to him or he said that to you?
472120	473120	I said that to him.
473120	475080	That could go either way in my opinion.
475080	479600	But he was like oh yeah like I get that a lot it kind of sucks but I and then he like
479600	484640	looks down at himself it's like it's because I look like this I'm like well kind of kind
484640	485640	of proved my point.
485640	486640	Confirmed.
486640	487640	Confirmed.
487800	491360	That's two douchebags talking to each other right after that day.
491360	494080	I'm just a small douchebag.
494080	495440	Kevin Hart size douchebag.
495440	500480	That's my New Year's resolution is go get as jacked as Ferri and also probably grow
500480	503200	six inches would be nice too.
503200	507720	My New Year's resolution is to stop taking Zach's shit in this fucking game.
507720	512440	Well the intro we have today is gonna maybe go opposite to that.
512440	518040	Let's go ahead and recap what happened last time so that Thomas cannot take my shit.
518040	521120	The five of you approached the jingle ball.
521120	526120	You find students there and faculty there acting strangely and a man began begins screaming
526120	529120	of the familiar phrase towel a la coal.
529120	532360	What was going through your guys's mind at that moment?
532360	534020	Like what what uh?
534020	537100	Same shit different day.
537100	539160	Mine was stop them immediately.
539160	542000	Yeah that dude sounds like he's casting a spell.
542000	543560	And I don't like spells.
543560	546520	I've heard enough spells to know they ain't usually good.
546520	553480	So Keith shot him and these students and faculty, Thomas's great school shooting joke from last
553480	559200	week aside, they all see this chanting man get shot probably for the first time.
559200	560200	Not a joke.
560200	561480	I just listened to this episode.
561480	565400	I legitimately suggested hey maybe we don't shoot up this fucking school.
565400	567880	I thought it was hilarious.
567880	571600	We found very funny and then immediately discarded that thought.
571600	575720	So everyone in this room starts acting even stranger.
575720	576720	Thoughts?
576720	583640	Hey, that's a I just find that kind of language like pretty derogatory thoughts anymore.
583640	586240	I kind of felt gross coming out of my mouth.
586240	587240	Yeah.
587240	588240	Them hoes.
588240	589240	We're just kidding.
589240	590240	I forgot.
590240	603980	I'm uh taking the word back so I'm empowering it.
603980	604980	You are a thought.
604980	605980	Wow.
605980	606980	Never mind.
606980	607980	I don't like it.
607980	616200	That did not last long.
616200	618480	Justin took it and then gave it right back.
618480	621440	Released it back to the universe.
621440	626800	So then John shot and killed a girl and he also shot two reindeer.
626800	627800	His idea.
627800	633400	It was totally on purpose.
633400	638360	Keith shot a young muscular man dressed as Santa Claus right between the eyes and these
638360	644500	students and faculty all see this and begin acting violently towards themselves and they
644500	648580	begin chanting and then the original chanting guy killed himself.
648580	649580	After I shot him though.
649580	650660	I want to make that clear.
650660	651660	Yes.
651660	652660	Yes, of course.
652660	654700	He was dying and then he killed himself.
654700	659700	That's college, baby.
659700	661920	So where do we stand?
661920	663900	Any final thoughts there?
663900	666700	Anything you want to talk about?
666700	671500	I don't know that we did the right thing, but guess what?
671500	672500	Can't change the past.
672500	674540	And the best we can.
674540	675540	I mean, yeah.
675540	676740	Not for lack of trying.
676740	679220	That's all anyone can expect of us, right?
679220	681860	With the information we've been presented.
681860	682860	We did our best.
682860	683860	We did.
683860	684860	So I was thinking a lot about that.
684860	685860	Okay, wait.
685860	686860	Hold on.
686860	690020	This lady was shaving reindeer, sharpening their horns.
690020	694120	Animal abuse was happening and everybody seemed to be on her side.
694120	697660	And those elves looked at me wrong.
697660	701260	And I think hot Santa made us all feel kind of bad about our bodies.
701260	702260	Yeah.
703020	706020	He had to die.
706020	712660	Well, I was kind of getting worried that maybe I hadn't given you guys enough information.
712660	717680	So I reached out to a few listeners and just kind of asked them a couple of questions about
717680	723140	what they thought was going on and they all get it.
723140	726700	At least most of the ones that I talked to understand where we're at.
726700	730520	So now I don't feel bad about what I've done to you and the choices that you've made and
730520	731520	I'm very happy.
731720	737680	You know what, hypothetical listeners out there that Zach may or may not have conjured
737680	738680	up out of his own.
738680	739680	Listeners like Deborah.
739680	740680	Deborah, stand up.
740680	741680	Oh shit.
741680	742680	He brought him.
742680	743680	Hey.
743680	744680	Hey Deborah.
744680	745680	Well, that's one.
745680	746680	Sup.
746680	747680	And Jamie.
747680	748680	Hey.
748680	749680	Fuck.
749680	753680	I love the podcast.
753680	754680	Okay.
754680	755920	Two doesn't prove anything.
755920	758120	Listeners like these can prove many things.
758120	759120	No, no, no.
759120	762520	I'm not impressed unless you bring in at least one more listener.
762520	763920	Well, Jared's here.
763920	764920	Here's the deal.
764920	765920	Some listeners have listened to...
765920	766920	Jared.
766920	767920	Hold on.
767920	768920	Jared's trying to talk.
768920	769920	Hey.
769920	770920	It's Jared here.
770920	771920	I totally have this whole podcast figured out.
771920	773640	I don't know why you guys don't know what's going on.
773640	774640	It's obvious.
774640	775640	What can you tell us, Jared?
775640	777640	I'm not going to fall for that one.
777640	778640	See?
778640	779640	See?
779640	780640	Yeah.
780640	784840	He's not going to fall for it because it'll be more fun when you guys figure it out eventually.
784840	785840	Okay.
785840	790360	I just want to tell the three of you who just stepped into this room that when you're playing
790360	799760	in the moment and drunk and kind of high and also doing these mysteries two, three weeks
799760	802200	apart sometimes, it's hard.
802200	803200	It's hard to keep track of those things.
803200	804200	Excuse me.
804200	805200	Excuse me.
805200	809200	I was going to say there are some people that have listened to 60-ish hours of this podcast
809200	810200	in a row.
810200	811200	In a row.
811200	812200	We like you.
812200	814080	In one day.
814520	818440	I have listened to this podcast only twice.
818440	825120	Every episode I've heard of twice, well, the first time is playing it and making it and
825120	828320	the second time is week by week for what are we at?
828320	836080	Like a thousand weeks now, you know, a thousand weeks since we started pushing this boulder
836080	837080	up the hill.
837080	850260	A thousand weeks if I could just ... Was that Bernie doing it?
850260	854160	If you did a thousand miles but you had two people, you could break it up and you could
854160	856640	each do 500 miles each.
856640	860760	Remember five minutes ago when we almost started the episode for the listeners and then we
860760	861760	just went back to that bullshit?
861760	863760	Zach, can you draw up your room?
863760	864760	Yeah, Zach.
864760	870120	It pains me to only now realize that there was a jingle ball playlist thumping for the
870120	872920	entire duration of the last episode.
872920	873920	Not canon.
873920	874920	Not canon.
874920	879180	Retroactively, I would like to say that blaring the entire time during all that super fucked
879180	884680	up shit was the classical Paul McCartney Christmas hit, Wonderful Christmas Time, but someone
884680	889360	had mashed it up so Danny Brown was rapping Grown Up over the top of it.
889360	890360	That sounds amazing.
890360	893880	Can I just say that song gets so much fucking shit and I love it.
893880	894880	I know.
894880	895880	I'm with you too.
895880	898320	Wait, the Paul McCartney song or the Danny Brown song?
898320	899400	The Paul McCartney song.
899400	901280	It's one of the most hated Christmas songs.
901280	902280	It's a great song.
902280	903280	Really?
903280	904280	Yeah.
904280	905280	People fucking hate that song.
905280	906280	People really fucking hate it.
906280	909080	It's just because they go to the mall and then they hear it 17 times and it's not all
909080	911440	I want for Christmas is you.
911440	915560	I'm not trying to say that, but it's cool.
915560	916560	It's weird.
916560	917560	It's like Paul.
917560	918560	Yeah.
918560	919560	I like it.
919560	922220	Did you see the tweet that talked about how it was a guy who thought for sure that that's
922220	926500	a song about a guy who is doing a ritual and gets walked in on.
926500	931780	The first lyric is like, the moon is up, the something something and then he have been
931780	932780	a wonderful Christmas.
932780	938820	And then he's like, oh, hey, simply having a wonderful Christmas.
938820	940200	The moon is right.
940200	941820	The spirits up.
941820	943180	We're here tonight.
943180	944180	And that's enough.
944180	949880	And then a guy walks in a wonderful Christmas time.
949880	956360	So as that beautiful, meaningful mashup concludes, the playlist cross fades into the new version
956360	959800	of Santa Baby by Tyler, the creator.
959800	963160	And the camera slowly pans around to survey the aftermath.
963160	964160	Is that real?
964160	965160	No, but I wish it was.
965160	966640	I was like, I've never heard that.
966640	970060	I was like, that sounds amazing.
970060	975140	The camera pans around to survey the aftermath of these last three minutes.
975140	981340	We see two lifeless, partially shaved reindeer next to a dead college student, all sharing
981340	984260	all mercy killings of dark red blood.
984260	989500	We see a Santa Claus who has been shot in the head laying next to two well wrapped person
989500	991540	shaped Christmas presents.
991540	997220	We see a man impaled on the elf's four poster chair and beyond him in Santa's throne.
997220	1003400	A woman in a bathrobe is splayed headfirst neck snapped in the throne's belly button.
1003400	1008360	Her legs limply akimbo on either side of the armrests.
1008360	1014000	The elves blood has frozen their corpses to the skating rink that has become their grave
1014000	1018280	in the regular place of a mop connected to a mopstick.
1018280	1025640	An upside down naked man is slumped face first and lungs full in the mop bucket.
1025640	1031160	Next to due to a past luck roll by Joe a very sturdy laptop.
1031160	1038400	Emilia Clark breathes her last breath in the arms of Clark Bishop.
1038400	1039400	Is her name Emilia Clark?
1039400	1040400	It wasn't Emilia Clark, right?
1040400	1041400	I'm sorry?
1041400	1042400	We went over the fact that I wasn't.
1042400	1043400	What was her actual name?
1043400	1044400	Locke.
1044400	1045400	Emilia Locke.
1045400	1046400	Oh, motherfucker.
1046400	1047400	I even wrote Emilia Locke.
1047400	1050680	You have fucked that up literally every single time.
1050680	1052880	I don't think you've said it correctly once.
1052880	1056840	Thomas just tried to look at my notes.
1056840	1060000	I just wanted to look at that one word and then I was like, oh, that's dumb.
1060040	1066000	I sit next to Zach now and I could theoretically blow this game wide open if I just leaned
1066000	1067000	a little bit to the right.
1067000	1068640	But I'm not going to do that.
1068640	1069640	That's appreciated.
1069640	1071200	So I need everyone to roll sanity.
1074800	1076800	Well, I ain't got none of that.
1076800	1077800	Oh, shit.
1077800	1078800	I pass.
1078800	1079800	Six.
1079800	1080800	I fail.
1080800	1081800	Fail.
1081800	1082800	Pass.
1082800	1083800	Actually, I don't know how much sanity I...
1083800	1084800	Oh, I do pass.
1084800	1085800	Barely though.
1085800	1086800	Okay.
1086800	1087800	So I am going to need...
1087800	1088800	Oh, I need a...
1088800	1089800	Thanks, baby.
1090600	1094600	John and Clark to roll a D6.
1094600	1095600	Fuck.
1095600	1096600	Five.
1096600	1097600	Fuck.
1097600	1098600	Six.
1098600	1099600	Joe!
1099600	1104600	God damn it.
1104600	1107520	And everybody needs to leave the room.
1107520	1110920	Everyone except me needs to leave the room.
1110920	1113200	When you're at your breaking point, that's...
1113200	1115120	When you're at that number, you hit it, right?
1115120	1116120	Yes.
1116120	1117120	Okay.
1117120	1118120	I exactly hit my breaking point.
1118120	1119120	I'm down to eight sanity.
1119440	1123000	I hit my breaking point also, and I am at two sanity now.
1123000	1124000	Damn.
1124000	1125000	Holy shit, y'all.
1125000	1126240	How did you lose so much?
1126240	1127240	I had a...
1127240	1128240	I forget.
1128240	1131200	There was some reason I had a really low amount really early on.
1131200	1132200	Like I got really screwed.
1132200	1136760	I guess mine doesn't go down too often because I don't care when violence happens.
1136760	1138160	You adapted to that.
1138160	1139160	Yeah.
1139160	1140160	What is your sanity?
1140160	1141760	My current sanity is 23 right now.
1141760	1142760	Fuck you.
1142760	1143760	What was your max sanity?
1143760	1144760	50.
1144760	1145760	Oh, damn.
1145760	1146760	I started at 60, apparently.
1146760	1147840	I started at 60.
1147840	1153000	But when we woke up in the mausoleum the second time, actually the first time we were there,
1153000	1155960	I think I was down to already like 16 or something like that.
1155960	1159320	I've been real low since we started this whole second life.
1159320	1163800	I think, yeah, my saving grace is that I have no empathy, so...
1163800	1168920	I also got ripped out of my own spine and put myself into my daddy's spine.
1168920	1170320	I don't think that helped.
1170320	1171320	I don't think it would.
1171320	1176320	I went ahead and rolled sanity for Leon Simpson, and Joe, can you see what I rolled?
1176320	1177320	He rolled an 88.
1177800	1178800	Ooh.
1178800	1182800	Which Leon obviously has 100, so that's a crit success.
1182800	1188080	All right, let's get some of you out of here and keep some of you.
1188080	1190160	I'm going to hold on to Joe first.
1190160	1192120	Everybody else, leave the room.
1192120	1193120	Hold on to me.
1193120	1194120	Oh, fuck.
1194120	1195120	Okay, I was...
1195120	1196120	I watched...
1196120	1197120	Oh, we were watching.
1197120	1198120	Oh, actually, hold up.
1198120	1199120	Sorry.
1199120	1202120	I'm going to hold on to Luke and Justin.
1207320	1223360	Luke and Justin, Keith Vigna, where are you standing in this room at the end of all this
1223360	1224360	chaos?
1224360	1226520	I think I was running back up the stairs.
1226520	1231360	I think you were running back up the stairs, which is where you would see Donovan, and
1231400	1240240	The very first person you notice is Leon Simpson, who immediately falls to the ground and starts
1240240	1247160	writhing all over the floor of the Accord Student Union, and he starts chanting.
1247160	1253480	And as he's chanting these numbers, two, five, one, four, one, nine, one, three, nine, two,
1253480	1259840	zero, eight, oh, one, two, five, one, four, one, oh, one, nine, one, three, nine, two,
1259840	1265120	zero, eight, and then he immediately goes and just starts running around trying to find
1265120	1266160	something to write with.
1266160	1271320	He's spreading out any liquid on the floor and drawing these letters out, these numbers
1271320	1272480	all over the ground.
1272480	1276400	I pull my phone out and I start writing down the numbers that he's saying.
1276400	1281720	I look at it and I'm immediately like, oh, hell yeah, I'll have to look at this later.
1281720	1288960	And as you do that, you notice that Clark Bishop and John Lee Pettymore are also drawing
1289360	1290760	numbers on the ground.
1290760	1291760	Are they the same numbers?
1291760	1292760	I'm chanting.
1292760	1297040	No, they are the numbers earlier that you would recognize as Bruce Robin.
1297040	1298040	Okay.
1298040	1300640	Is Leon still occupied with this?
1300640	1301640	Very occupied.
1301640	1307000	I want to go over and just give him just a slap on the face to like snap out of it.
1307000	1310320	He does not pay attention whatsoever to the slap.
1310320	1312280	Donovan, what did you do to him?
1312280	1314160	I didn't do anything.
1314160	1315680	Donovan's just like freaking out.
1315680	1321640	Just eyes super wide, looking around, just like, uh, like it's frozen, just paralyzed.
1321640	1325520	I've never experienced this before, so he's just like, uh, very scared.
1325520	1327080	I grabbed Donovan by the shoulders.
1327080	1328400	I'm like, are you okay?
1328400	1329400	Here.
1329400	1330400	You didn't kill anybody, did you?
1330400	1331400	No, no.
1331400	1332400	Thank God.
1332400	1335440	It's kind of a great feeling sometimes, but if you've never done it before, I wouldn't
1335440	1337560	want to help you handle this.
1337560	1338560	I didn't want to.
1338560	1340460	Leon just tried to help me though.
1340460	1342200	Was he acting like this the whole time or?
1342200	1344240	No, he just now dropped.
1344240	1349600	I go over to Clark and try to slap him and slap him out of it too.
1349600	1350600	Same thing.
1350600	1351600	Nothing.
1351600	1352960	Are Leon's headphones on?
1352960	1354480	Leon's headphones are on.
1354480	1357640	That would have been the only idea Donovan had.
1357640	1360240	I guess I'll take them off, see if it does anything.
1360240	1361240	It does not.
1361240	1362240	Okay.
1362240	1367600	So right now the five of us are the only people live in this room.
1367600	1368600	That is correct.
1369480	1371520	I don't fucking know.
1371520	1374480	I get on my phone and I start trying to decode this number.
1374480	1375480	It says Ben Smith.
1375480	1376480	That was easy.
1376480	1378920	Thanks for not making me do it.
1378920	1379920	You've done it before.
1379920	1380920	Ben Smith.
1380920	1381920	Have I ever heard that name before?
1381920	1382920	No.
1382920	1384920	I Google it.
1384920	1385920	Okay.
1385920	1386920	Yeah.
1386920	1387920	You Google it and you find...
1387920	1389880	I Google Ben Smith CSU.
1389880	1395840	When you Google Ben Smith CSU, you find a student profile and you recognize the student
1395840	1403200	Ben Smith as the one who was standing doing squats on Santa's throne, who initially started
1403200	1404200	the chant.
1404200	1405520	I'm going to go over to...
1405520	1409040	Is he on Santa's throne or what did he impale himself on?
1409040	1411440	On the elf's four poster chair.
1411440	1412440	Downstairs?
1412440	1413600	Down the stairs from the throne, yeah.
1413600	1418600	I'm going to go grab his wallet and just kind of like check and see what's on his person.
1418600	1419600	Yeah.
1419600	1420600	Ben Smith, student ID.
1420600	1423200	He's been a CSU student for two years now.
1424120	1426520	Nothing out of the ordinary in his pockets or anything?
1426520	1433960	There is a piece of paper that has the math that led to 330 Gift's house and then there's
1433960	1439400	another piece of paper that he wrote out the letters to play on the Casio keyboard.
1439400	1442880	So he got here the same way we did just by following the scavenger hunt?
1442880	1443880	Must have.
1443880	1447760	Since I don't find anything else of interest on him, I want to go over to Clark.
1447760	1449240	Does he have the laptop still?
1449240	1451000	The laptop is on the ground, yeah.
1451000	1453480	I'm going to open the laptop up and power it on.
1453480	1458320	When you open up the laptop and power it on, you see that it is still kicking due to that
1458320	1461320	successful luck roll last game.
1461320	1465400	And there are a few things open on the desktop.
1465400	1469200	There are three screenshots from Twitter and two videos.
1469200	1471320	What are the screenshots of?
1471320	1476920	The screenshots are all from the CSU biology department and I'm going to send you a message
1476920	1478080	right now.
1478080	1479080	With those on?
1479080	1480080	Okay, sweet.
1480160	1481160	Just like text tweets?
1481160	1484640	Yes, but I made fake ones so it'll be fun.
1484640	1485640	Tight.
1485640	1489840	So the three screenshots from Twitter and two videos are open.
1489840	1491220	What are those entitled?
1491220	1497280	They are not titled, but one is of a young woman that you recognize from pictures as
1497280	1503960	Harriet Marks sitting in her dorm room and the other is a very dark and distorted picture
1503960	1508160	and you can only make out a candle in the middle of the frame.
1508160	1513800	The one with the candle, does it remind me of like the pictures that we took with the
1513800	1514800	camera?
1514800	1518060	You know, where everything was black except certain...
1518060	1519800	Only in the sense that it's dark.
1519800	1522380	But it doesn't have that same like feel to it.
1522380	1523380	It does not.
1523380	1524380	And the only thing I can see is a candle.
1524380	1525380	Yes.
1525380	1526380	Okay.
1526380	1528360	Go ahead and check out those tweets I just sent.
1528360	1531180	Justin, do you want to read what's going on there?
1531180	1536320	We got who the tweet came from, what time it was sent, what day it was sent, and what
1536320	1537320	it says.
1537320	1541300	CSU Biology Department at CSU Bio.
1541300	1545960	This seems crazy, but a few of us who are not infected have quarantined ourselves in
1545960	1546960	the lab.
1546960	1548360	Please call 911.
1548360	1550160	Our calls are not going through.
1550160	1552680	1036 p.m. December 3rd.
1552680	1553780	Call 911.
1553780	1554780	Call 911.
1554780	1555780	Emergency.
1555780	1558760	CSU campus is infected with some sort of virus.
1558760	1559760	Please help us.
1559760	1560900	We are trapped in the lab at CSU.
1560900	1561900	Please call 911.
1561900	1565020	2 48 a.m. 4th of December.
1565020	1566920	We're still quarantined in the lab.
1566920	1570760	If you're the person or entity scrubbing this page, please have a heart.
1570760	1572600	We are running low on supplies.
1572600	1575560	2 48 p.m. 6th of December.
1575560	1576840	And today's date is?
1576840	1578480	The 6th of December.
1578480	1580240	And it is, what time is it now?
1580240	1581500	Like evening?
1581500	1582500	Almost 9 o'clock.
1582500	1583880	It's like 8 30.
1583880	1585800	Where did it say they're quarantined at?
1585800	1586800	The lab.
1586800	1594520	Like in our travels to find the Accord Student Union, did I happen to see a biology hall?
1594560	1597040	Donovan would know where the biology lab is.
1597040	1598040	Okay.
1598040	1603800	Okay, so I look at the laptop and I yell up to Donovan like, what do you study here?
1603800	1605440	I'm a communications major.
1605440	1608080	Have you ever taken a science class?
1608080	1610720	Yeah, you have to.
1610720	1612120	They wouldn't let me not take it.
1612120	1617000	We need to go to the science hall and then I run up the stairs and I show him the tweets
1617000	1618000	from the laptop.
1618000	1623420	Donovan, you would know that the science hall is called Glass Hall.
1623420	1625360	That's where all my classes are this semester.
1625360	1626360	Glass Hall?
1626360	1627360	Oh my God, there's one at MSU.
1627360	1629900	Yeah, that's what I thought you were doing.
1629900	1632220	So at Missouri State University, we have a glass hall.
1632220	1636620	I forgot about that because I only went for five semesters.
1636620	1641480	This is my last semester and I'll finally, you know, I did it pretty quickly, but seven
1641480	1644180	years for a bachelor's is pretty, pretty average.
1644180	1645180	Well done, sir.
1645180	1646660	Eight years, baby.
1646660	1648540	Hell yeah.
1648540	1651060	We all took a while to do it, but hey.
1651060	1652060	We did it.
1652060	1653060	Luke hasn't done it yet.
1653700	1656180	I focused on booze a little harder than my classes sometimes.
1656180	1661340	So in the city, CSU's glass hall is named that because a certain amount of money was
1661340	1667180	given by a certain person and at that moment I'm going to get Thomas and Joe to join us
1667180	1670180	back in the room and in fact, you guys won't be here.
1670180	1671180	Cool.
1671180	1672980	Cause I have to take a tinkle time.
1683060	1692660	Hey Joe, hello Zachary.
1692660	1698700	So on this arc of pretending to be people, I'm running the sanity mechanics slightly
1698700	1699700	different.
1699700	1704100	However, this seems to line up perfectly with you hitting your breaking point.
1704100	1709660	So as we've done in the past, I'm going to have you roll a D100 three times and we will
1709660	1717020	choose a mania and this mania will need to overtake all of your decisions, all of your
1717020	1721540	words, all of your role-playing actions for the duration.
1721540	1723340	Holy shit.
1723340	1725820	Roll them up.
1725820	1727820	I got an 82.
1727820	1728820	82?
1728820	1729820	No.
1729820	1730820	Oh.
1730820	1732140	Get out of here.
1732140	1736420	Thomas just walked in like he was supposed to be in here, that goofball.
1736420	1738740	I got a 49.
1738740	1742740	49 and what is that last one?
1742740	1744020	A 48.
1744020	1745020	48.
1745020	1746420	Thankfully close.
1746420	1752180	So 82 is photomania, the pathological desire for light.
1752180	1753180	That's fun.
1753180	1754180	Interesting.
1754180	1760580	49 is goatomania, obsession with witches and witchcraft.
1760580	1768620	And geolomania, the uncontrollable compulsion to laugh.
1768620	1771620	Well, the left one is the easiest one to do.
1771620	1774940	Does Joe have a compulsion to laugh?
1774940	1776460	I have that in real life.
1776460	1779460	I have geolomania.
1779460	1781540	As we both laugh at that.
1781540	1783460	I think I would take the light thing.
1783460	1787980	I think that's interesting that I'm always searching for the light.
1787980	1790860	Obsessed and searching for light.
1790860	1795540	So when you say it takes over my character, can I be involved in discussions now or do
1795540	1799420	I have to be trying to get away from the group to find the light source at all times?
1799420	1805660	You know how Thomas has been kind of off topic but still going with what's happening in the
1805660	1806660	group?
1806660	1807660	Uh huh.
1807660	1808660	Like that.
1808660	1809660	Okay.
1809660	1812860	So obsessed but also, you know, don't ruin the podcast.
1812860	1813860	Yeah.
1813860	1814860	Okay.
1814860	1815860	Yeah.
1815860	1816860	I think I can do that.
1816860	1817860	All right.
1817860	1818860	Sounds good.
1818860	1819860	I'm going to grab no one.
1819860	1822860	I'm going to get everyone and then we're going to happen.
1822860	1823860	Okay.
1823860	1839060	I'm going to get everyone and then we're going to happen.
1839060	1844220	Keith Vigna and Donovan Westerfuck, you guys, what's your last name?
1844220	1845220	West Haven.
1845220	1852300	In Donovan West Haven, the two of you notice the eyes light back up in Clark Bishop and
1852300	1856140	John Lee Pettymore and even in Leon Simpson.
1856140	1861980	And as you notice that happening, Leon Simpson gets up and starts boogieing down.
1861980	1867700	He's shaking his hips, he's snapping his fingers and he starts dancing down the stairs.
1867700	1868700	Okay.
1868700	1872940	So you said that people have figured this out, out of character.
1872940	1876900	One thing I have thought is that maybe some of your inspiration for this was like dancing
1876900	1877900	sickness.
1877900	1880580	I don't know what that is to me either.
1880580	1885940	It's what the movie Joker is about.
1885940	1886940	Didn't see it.
1886940	1887940	You should.
1887940	1888940	It's really good.
1888940	1895100	So I see them wake back up and I run over to Clark and I shove the laptop in his hands
1895100	1896540	and I'm like, look at this.
1896540	1900060	And the glow of the laptop illuminates your face.
1900060	1901060	I just stare at the laptop.
1901060	1902060	Sorry.
1902060	1903060	I meant dancing mania.
1903060	1904060	Have you heard of that?
1904060	1905060	Yes, for sure.
1905060	1907540	And that is what this is all based off of.
1907540	1910740	I've only seen the parody Dirty Dancing Mania.
1910740	1915920	The dancing plague or dance epidemic of 1518 was a case of dancing mania that occurred
1915920	1922620	in Strasbourg, Alsace, now modern day France, and the Holy Roman Empire in July, 1518.
1922620	1926700	Around 400 people took to dancing for days without rest and over the period of about
1926700	1931540	one month, some of those affected collapsed or even died of heart attack, stroke or exhaustion.
1931540	1932540	Do they know what?
1932540	1933540	Dancing mania.
1933540	1934540	Do they know what happened?
1934540	1936580	Well, let me go to the page for dancing mania.
1936620	1938980	Wait, that wasn't the page for dancing mania?
1938980	1942740	That's the page for the dancing plague of 1518, which is one of the most famous.
1942740	1944220	My guess is of the dancing prion.
1944220	1946740	Well, I think it's kind of related to like speaking in tongues.
1946740	1948860	It's just like a social like, oh, they did it on purpose.
1948860	1950460	I thought it was like a sickness.
1950460	1953140	I never spoke on tongues on purpose.
1953140	1955420	I've seen people speak.
1955420	1956420	Have you spoken in tongues?
1956420	1957420	Yes.
1957420	1958420	Yes.
1958420	1960420	No, I've seen people speak in tongues and I don't think they're doing it on purpose.
1960420	1961900	I always threw in the F word.
1962220	1971780	I'd be like, are you speaking in tongues when you do tall?
1971780	1977220	As a sixth grader, I realized I was an atheist when I went to James river church camp and
1977220	1982940	they made us speak in tongues and I was like, oh, this isn't real.
1982940	1989300	So I just sent you guys screenshots of three tweets that were screenshotted and saved onto
1989300	1991300	the desktop of this computer.
1991300	1997980	The other two things on this desktop are videos and the like screenshot, the screen cap of
1997980	1999180	each video.
1999180	2003180	One is of a woman, the young woman that you recognize as Harriet marks.
2003180	2004420	She's sitting in her dorm room.
2004420	2011140	It looks to be like a webcam video and the other is a video that is very dark and distorted
2011140	2015580	looking and you can only make out a candle in the middle of the frame.
2015580	2019580	Go ahead and read those tweets cause that's our next step.
2019580	2024580	Clark is staring at the laptop and slowly his face is getting closer and closer to the
2024580	2027460	screen until his forehead is just touching the screen.
2027460	2028900	I look at him do this.
2028900	2032540	I'm like, his forehead is touching the screen for like five or six seconds.
2032540	2036980	And I'm like, Clark, what, what do you, what are you doing?
2036980	2039740	Just uh, just getting, getting closer to it.
2039740	2040740	That's all.
2040740	2041940	Can you read those?
2041940	2042940	Read what?
2042940	2047460	Oh, those, those pictures, those screenshots of tweets.
2047460	2048460	Right.
2048460	2049460	Sure, sure, sure.
2049460	2050460	Yeah.
2050460	2053580	And he moves the laptop to a reading distance and reads them.
2053580	2059340	Uh, the first one says, this seems crazy, but a few of us, I'm sorry, these are tweets.
2059340	2064180	They're screenshots of tweets from the CSU biology department says, uh, this seems crazy.
2064180	2069260	Real quick, kudos to Zach for apparently learning Photoshop or maybe GIMP and putting these
2069260	2070260	together.
2070260	2071260	Maybe you had Justin do it.
2071260	2073980	This is a lot of, uh, this is a lot of work as well.
2073980	2076900	GIMPs transfer, um, pneumatic image processing.
2077340	2078340	Uh, I don't remember.
2078340	2080780	It's, it's a free, it's a free alternative to Photoshop.
2080780	2081780	That's fairly popular.
2081780	2082780	Doesn't pneumatic start with a P?
2082780	2083780	Wouldn't it be PIMP?
2083780	2084780	It's new.
2084780	2085780	It's GNU.
2085780	2087900	It's some fucking freeware shit.
2087900	2088900	I don't know, man.
2088900	2089900	But it is GNU.
2089900	2091020	What do the tweets say?
2091020	2095500	The first one says, this seems crazy, but a few of us who are not infected have quarantined
2095500	2096740	ourselves in the lab.
2096740	2097740	Please call 911.
2097740	2101380	Our calls are not going through and they didn't finish writing the word through.
2101540	2104900	Uh, the second one says in all caps, call 911, call 911.
2104900	2108900	Emergency CSU campus is infected with some sort of virus.
2108900	2109900	Please help us.
2109900	2111400	We are trapped in the lab at CSU.
2111400	2112400	Please call 911.
2112400	2116940	And the third and last tweet says, we're still quarantined in the lab.
2116940	2120820	If you are the person or entity scrubbing this page, please have a heart.
2120820	2122500	We are running low on supplies.
2122500	2126260	If you pay attention, the last tweet was sent out this afternoon.
2126260	2127260	Oh yeah.
2127260	2130640	So the first, the first tweet is dated December 3rd.
2130640	2135600	The second tweet is dated December 4th and the third tweet is dated December 6th.
2135600	2137800	So we should stay away from the lab, right?
2137800	2140080	This ain't really dramatic.
2140080	2143800	Well, I was, I was talking to Donovan.
2143800	2145640	He knows where the lab is.
2145640	2147920	It's in, it's in glass hall.
2147920	2152080	Not the one at Missouri state university, but the one at city state university.
2152080	2153080	Exactly.
2153080	2155680	Uh, apparently Marvin has something to do with it.
2155680	2156800	Well, finance it.
2156800	2160400	But anyway, I was thinking, I think we got to go help.
2160400	2161400	See what's going on there.
2161400	2162400	Yeah.
2162400	2163880	I think we should, uh, we should investigate the lab.
2163880	2165200	I mean, if they're survivors.
2165200	2166200	Yeah.
2166200	2167200	Well that's what I'm thinking.
2167200	2171780	They probably have, I mean, Donovan's a survivor and he's not, hasn't tried to hurt us yet.
2171780	2175080	So I think we might as well try to go help some other people.
2175080	2177120	Everybody roll alertness for me.
2177120	2178120	Donovan.
2178120	2182920	You probably have pretty low alertness.
2182920	2183920	I pass.
2183920	2184920	Oh fuck.
2184920	2185920	Yeah.
2185920	2186920	I pass a 54 and a 60.
2186920	2188580	I got a 36 on a 60.
2188580	2195040	I was a 47 on a 70, 64 on what I assume is not.
2195040	2201020	So as the beautiful rendition of Santa baby by Tyler, the creator finishes, can you give
2201020	2209180	us just a little, uh, don't Justin will work on it.
2209180	2210740	We'll drop it later.
2210740	2212020	Well, actually, you know what?
2212020	2216820	Uh, we'll just message Tyler and see if he'll just, we're like, Hey Justin, we just mentioned
2216820	2219980	that in the art podcast world and Justin, sorry.
2219980	2223740	He's like, why are you calling me Justin in our world?
2223740	2224740	You're just in the grid.
2224740	2228020	You know, my secret name, I must do what you say.
2228020	2230660	I found out his last name isn't the creator.
2230660	2231660	That's wild.
2231660	2232660	It is wild.
2232660	2233980	No, they can't just, you can't just lie like that.
2233980	2234980	Apparently he does.
2234980	2235980	No, it's not bad boy.
2235980	2236980	Legal.
2236980	2237980	Yeah.
2237980	2240580	Well he would have had to change his name.
2240780	2246180	The room goes completely silent as the song ends and looking over, the only thing you
2246180	2253020	hear is the tapping feet of Leon Simpson as he is just fucking grinding and getting it
2253020	2256860	on the dance floor that no longer exists.
2256860	2261900	But you also hear the phone in his pocket is buzzing incessantly.
2261900	2264780	Leon, Leon, your phone, your phone's ringing.
2265780	2275020	Oh, two, five, one, four, one nine, one, three, nine, two, zero, okay.
2275020	2276020	Oh yeah.
2276020	2277020	I got it already.
2277020	2278020	Don't worry.
2278020	2279020	Get down.
2279020	2283340	As he's doing that, I gather Clark and John and I'm like, Hey, Donovan just watches.
2283340	2285540	I kind of like look at Donovan and I like wave him over.
2285540	2290580	I'm like, he can come over if he wants.
2290580	2294700	So you guys were, you guys were just out of it.
2294700	2301420	Like you, Leon, you were reciting the numbers that was for Robin and uh, no, I was, I was
2301420	2307580	carrying the laptop and the girl that I was just, you were at, you don't, you try to understand
2307580	2308580	what I'm doing.
2308580	2314300	Well, you guys were saying the words for Robin, for Bruce Robin and Leon was reciting those
2314300	2319940	same numbers and I looked it up and uh, it's for a name, Ben Smith.
2319940	2323820	And uh, I looked it up and it's, it's that one right there.
2323820	2330140	And he points to the man who was previously doing squats on Santa's throne and was the
2330140	2338380	first to chant Tawa Alakol before diving neck first on the four poster chair that the elf
2338380	2341020	might sit in for picture time.
2341020	2347860	You guys, we, we've been, you know, chanting and writing numbers that are for Bruce Robin
2347860	2353780	and Bruce was doing it for Harriet Marks, but Leon's doing it for Ben Smith.
2353780	2358260	How I'm just trying to wrap my mind around what, what's it mean?
2358260	2360540	Did Leon do anything with Ben's body?
2360540	2361540	Did he?
2361540	2365500	No, I, I shot Ben and then Ben jumped off and killed himself.
2365500	2367700	Donovan, you were with him last, right?
2367700	2369460	What was he, was he doing anything?
2369460	2371100	He just crumpled to the ground.
2371100	2375420	He started chanting the numbers and writhing like he was in pain.
2375420	2376420	Just all of a sudden.
2376420	2377420	Just out of nowhere.
2377420	2378420	Yeah, out of nowhere.
2378420	2379420	I saw it.
2379420	2382540	I thought it was having a seizure at first until he started talking and, and uh, he was
2382540	2386340	chanting the numbers and, and, and right, like trying to write them down on the ground.
2386340	2390220	It was, I don't know how these numbers affect us.
2390220	2391220	That's evident.
2391220	2397860	I do, but it's not my time to tell you, John, if you know, you gotta, you gotta tell us.
2397860	2399820	That's basically our whole job here.
2399820	2400820	Clack.
2400820	2401820	Clack.
2401820	2405020	Dear Clack, I don't know right now.
2405020	2406020	I will know.
2406020	2409180	Well, that's, that's how information works.
2409180	2410180	Yes.
2410180	2413100	All right, Keith, you got any ideas?
2413100	2423780	I was thinking, I was thinking up until, I was thinking up until this point we were saying
2423780	2429540	Bruce Robin's numbers because, well, I mean, we didn't kill him, but I mean, basically
2429540	2430540	we did.
2430540	2435220	So I was thinking that he might've killed Harriet Marks, but now that doesn't make any
2435220	2439060	sense cause, cause Leon didn't kill Ben Smith.
2439060	2440540	Bruce Robin killed himself.
2440540	2441540	That's right.
2441540	2442540	That's yeah.
2442540	2447260	So in our, in our presence, is it when I was doing numbers just now, was I doing Ben Smith?
2447260	2449540	No, you were doing Bruce Robin still.
2449540	2454740	So maybe if you're in proximity of somebody who's doing the Talia Lecourt thing, you start
2454740	2456260	saying the numbers of their death?
2456260	2458580	Maybe, but I still just don't know what it means.
2458580	2463080	I'm thinking maybe Bruce Robbins is the one that's infected me and I can't be reinfected
2463080	2464080	by a new one.
2464080	2465080	Could be.
2465080	2466080	You're not, you're not doing numbers.
2466080	2472580	Donovan was, I was, I woke up, I woke up doing Bruce Robbins, but I mean, I, I haven't done
2472580	2473580	it recently.
2473580	2477740	I just haven't, both times that you guys have done it when I've seen you, you just, it was
2477740	2480380	like you left for a little bit.
2480380	2481460	It's like checked out.
2481460	2485060	It's like you've passed some kind of test that we've failed.
2485060	2486060	Seemingly.
2486060	2487060	I don't know.
2487060	2493460	And I look, I look down and I look down at Leon and yell, Leon, what are you doing?
2493460	2495620	He's fucking getting it.
2495620	2496620	That's the electric slide.
2496620	2503260	Does he not pay attention to, to the left, to the left, to the left, to the left, to
2503260	2504260	the right.
2504780	2508660	John and I, when we, when we do this, how do you snap us out of it?
2508660	2509660	I tried.
2509660	2515940	Well, Zach just yells and we come in the room.
2515940	2519620	All three of you guys just kind of like at the same time, just like, it was almost like
2519620	2523780	you were just not in reality and I slapped Leon and nothing happened.
2523780	2527340	I came up and I slapped you to try to get you out of it and nothing.
2527340	2531820	You just kept on and both times it's happened that I've seen, I just wait for you to snap
2531820	2532820	back into it.
2533380	2534660	My face hurts.
2534660	2536220	Please stop slapping us.
2536220	2539980	Well, that's odd cause I only slapped Clark.
2539980	2543060	I feel the pain of all crashes.
2543060	2545800	I think Leon might be a lost cause at this point.
2545800	2547580	I think we need to get over to that lab.
2547580	2550420	I don't know if we should bring Leon with us or the agony.
2550420	2553180	Clark is going to walk over to Leon and try and shake him.
2553180	2556620	I'm not going to hit him, but I'm going to like shake him by the shoulders.
2556620	2559740	Roll luck.
2559740	2561940	I pass a 48.
2562060	2564900	I've been rolling 48 and 47s on different dice all night.
2564900	2566900	How much luck do you have?
2566900	2567900	65.
2567900	2568900	Damn.
2568900	2569900	Joe regained some health.
2569900	2570900	Luck.
2570900	2573220	Joe regained some luck.
2573220	2581620	John looks up from the CSU campus beyond the ether and he winks at Joe.
2581620	2582620	Like Joe?
2582620	2583620	Holy shit.
2583620	2584620	Wow.
2584620	2590900	And in that exact moment, Ooh, that was creepy.
2591380	2595020	It must have worked cause Joe got chills.
2595020	2596020	Joe chill.
2596020	2597020	Wholesome joker.
2597020	2598900	You killed Batman's parents.
2598900	2607020	John looks at you and says, who's Joe?
2607020	2614980	And Clark shakes Leon who does not stop dancing, however, his buzzing cell phone falls out
2614980	2615980	of his trousers.
2615980	2620340	Hey, does he have angry birds on there?
2620700	2625940	It falls to the ground and you see that a number that is unknown is calling and then
2625940	2632820	the call ends and it has 25 missed calls from unknown and a few texts as well.
2632820	2635060	I want to read them texts straight away.
2635060	2638900	And it seems like it's only a matter of time before unknown calls again.
2638900	2642060	Also this, uh, this phone pretty bright for the room.
2642060	2643060	Nice.
2643060	2644060	What do you mean?
2644060	2645060	Pretty bright for the room.
2645060	2649140	It just like has a nice glow to it because it's dance party time at the jingle ball.
2649140	2651020	The lights are dimmed.
2651020	2652700	Pretty bright compared to the room.
2652700	2653700	Yes.
2653700	2654700	Okay.
2654700	2655700	Gotcha.
2655700	2659700	I just sent you guys a screenshot of the text message conversation that was on this phone.
2659700	2665540	You did and bold of you to assume that my phone would not be dead.
2665540	2670740	So unknown texts Leon and says, how's it going?
2670740	2677540	And Leon replies, the secretary is stubborn looking for another opinion.
2677540	2678540	Option.
2679540	2682300	It sounded just like Leon.
2682300	2684700	Hey, maybe don't save it as a JPEG next time.
2684700	2686500	You are doing such a good job of reading.
2686500	2687500	I'm proud of you.
2687500	2688500	Fucking got him.
2688500	2692260	I don't know what a JPEG has been recognized as ours though was.
2692260	2704600	Oh, I think you, you would pronounce it, uh, it's a, it's a, hold on, how's it going?
2704600	2707820	The secretary is stubborn looking for another option.
2707820	2709220	I don't want excuses.
2709220	2710220	Pick up.
2710220	2711220	Okay.
2711220	2712220	Oh, sorry.
2712220	2714900	That is not as clear as I thought it would not clear at all.
2714900	2715900	Yeah.
2715900	2718380	So the first message is from unknown and it says, how's it going?
2718380	2722700	And then Leon replies, the secretary is stubborn looking for another option.
2722700	2727300	And then the rest of the messages go unanswered from unknown.
2727300	2729580	They say, I don't want excuses.
2729580	2730580	Pick up.
2730580	2731580	Okay.
2731580	2737260	I sent them T O it's capitalized to, we'll be ready for extraction.
2737260	2742500	Don't forget to get the signatures ETA question mark, and then another question mark.
2742500	2743500	Jesus Christ.
2743500	2744500	What is going on?
2744500	2745700	That's also from unknown.
2745700	2748460	And then three, three question marks.
2748460	2754500	And then if he doesn't get here in time, this is all over everything we've worked for.
2754500	2760140	Everything that exists just gone for what your fucking conscience, morality won't save
2760140	2761140	us.
2761140	2762140	God.
2762140	2763140	Clark.
2763140	2764140	What are you looking at?
2764140	2769140	Uh, let me read it for you.
2769140	2777140	Okay, go ahead.
2777140	2782380	I did realize that, uh, Joe and I think probably Clark would to figure it out why that T O
2782380	2783420	is capitalized.
2783420	2784420	That's the overseer.
2784420	2785420	I believe.
2785420	2786420	Dang.
2786420	2787420	Nice.
2787420	2788420	Okay.
2788420	2792260	Can you figure out why ETA is capitalized?
2792260	2793260	It says, okay.
2793260	2794260	I sent them.
2794260	2795900	The overseer will be ready for extraction.
2795900	2797540	Don't forget the signatures.
2797540	2801580	I don't exactly know what any of it means, but it sounds like they were preparing for
2801580	2802580	the overseer.
2802580	2804380	Hey Clark, text him back.
2804380	2805380	Why?
2805380	2807460	Which I will, but I don't know what, I don't know.
2807460	2813980	I mean, I was hoping that I had the suggestion and you would figure out the rest from there.
2813980	2816820	This person seems to know Leon and knows what's going on.
2816820	2822180	Do you think I should just say Leon is compromised or Leon's got the numbers in him or just
2822180	2836420	just see what they say back to the numbers in that is baby grand pianos for a single.
2836420	2844380	I think just say, uh, say, say this, should you tell him that you're the overseer?
2844380	2846860	Well yeah, I think he knows, he knows, right?
2846860	2851380	I just text back, this is the overseer.
2851380	2854980	Now say, now say bitch.
2854980	2860300	I mean, I know he knows you are, but I'm saying if you sent, if you send him a text, should
2860300	2865620	you say it's you or no, no, we, we should pretend to be Leon on this phone unless we
2865620	2870740	make a total power move by being like this, the overseer, I won't be extracted ready for
2870740	2872360	my fist.
2872360	2876520	This last message message says if he doesn't get here in time, this is all over everything
2876520	2877520	we've worked for.
2877520	2882580	Anything that exists gone for what your fucking conscience morality won't save us.
2882580	2885780	So was this some kind of side mission that Leon was having us on?
2885780	2890920	I thought, I figured it was coming down from Maggie yourself, but Oh, maybe this is probably
2890920	2892640	Maggie isn't it?
2892640	2894640	It could be.
2894640	2899640	Guys, guys, does Maggie suck?
2899640	2901960	Just text back Maggie question mark.
2901960	2902960	You think I should?
2902960	2903960	He'd know that.
2903960	2905120	Well, he doesn't know anything right now.
2905120	2906120	I don't know.
2906120	2907120	But I mean, Leon.
2907120	2908120	I don't know.
2908120	2909120	That's what I'm saying.
2909120	2910120	Leon don't know anything right now.
2910120	2911120	Look at it.
2911120	2912120	Hold on.
2912120	2913120	Hold on.
2913120	2924120	Text her that those numbers or just any random numbers she might not respond.
2924120	2926920	I don't know if we could indicate that Leon is compromised.
2926920	2927920	Why don't we just say that?
2927920	2933360	Why don't we just say this is a whatever the fuck Justin's character's name is Donovan
2933360	2940960	West, West and Donna Donovan Westerfuck and I am a student here and West Haven.
2940960	2943260	I have a student here.
2943260	2948340	He taught me how to shoot Leon Leon and trusted the mission to me.
2948340	2949340	But he's gone.
2949340	2950340	Yeah.
2950340	2951340	Text that and then let's go to the lab.
2951340	2952340	Let's just go to the lab.
2952340	2953340	Fuck Maggie.
2953340	2956360	If this is Maggie, I would worry that she would clam up that she wouldn't text back
2956360	2959600	if she knew it wasn't Leon she was talking to you or at least a part of the circle of
2959600	2960600	knowledge.
2960600	2963000	I'm just going to take I'm going to say, Hey, it's Clark.
2963000	2965760	If we think it's her, I'll say, Hey, it's Clark and it will see what happens with the
2965760	2966760	reply.
2966760	2967760	If it's like, who's Clark?
2967760	2968760	Be like, Hey, man.
2968760	2969760	Say, Hey, it's Clark.
2969760	2970760	I'm going to I do that.
2970760	2971760	I reply back.
2971760	2972760	Hey, it's Clark.
2972760	2973760	Leon's compromised.
2973760	2974760	Leon's compromised.
2974760	2975760	Yeah.
2975760	2976760	Okay.
2976760	2978120	Well, while we wait for a text back, I think we ought to go to the lab and check that out.
2978120	2979760	I'm going to try Leon one more time.
2979760	2986200	Leon, do you want to do you want to come with us or y'all said, Oh, I'm getting it up.
2986200	2988200	Oh, I'm getting it.
2988200	2989200	Yeah.
2989200	2992120	Do you want to dance walk with us?
2992120	2993120	You can keep dancing.
2993120	2998240	If you want to follow us, I look at you and I'm like, put a hand on his shoulder and like
2998240	3002160	try to like push him in front of me and I'm like, let's just lead him that way.
3002160	3004400	I mean, I don't know if we should leave him.
3004400	3005400	He'll keep dancing.
3005400	3006400	Will he go with it?
3006400	3007400	Sure.
3007400	3008400	Let's do it.
3008400	3009400	Where you lead.
3009400	3010400	I will follow.
3010400	3011400	Okay.
3011400	3018720	So John definitely not looking at his phone, but you saw him looking at his phone earlier,
3018720	3024480	but he just seems to speak out of like pure knowledge affecting thousands of people across
3024480	3026000	several centuries.
3026000	3031440	Dancing mania was not an isolated event and was well-documented.
3031440	3033360	He says it like he's not reading it.
3033360	3035960	Well-documented in contemporary reports.
3035960	3040800	It was nevertheless poorly understood and remedies were based on guesswork.
3040800	3045920	Often musicians accompanied dancers due to belief that music would treat the mania, but
3045920	3048120	this sometimes backfired.
3048120	3051400	No fucking chance.
3051400	3058200	By encouraging more to join in.
3058200	3064440	There is no consensus among modern day scholars as to the cause of dancing mania.
3064440	3066160	That's real interesting.
3066160	3071360	John was facing away from all of you while he said this.
3071360	3076140	He was kind of saying it at a plant in the hallway.
3076180	3081620	As soon as he finishes talking, I look at Clark, I don't have a good feeling about any of this.
3081620	3085860	Something real bad's affected him, but he's not doing anything bad per se.
3085860	3089780	I just kind of, I just want to go home.
3089780	3092860	Let's go to that lab and see if there's anybody left here.
3092860	3095460	Otherwise I'm going to get the fuck off this campus.
3095460	3096460	Everybody run the alertness.
3096460	3102380	Well, real quick, damn it.
3102380	3104660	I fail 89 on a 60.
3104700	3107740	I fail 94 on a less than that.
3107740	3109700	I fail a 79 on a 70.
3109700	3110700	Donovan?
3110700	3111700	I rolled a six.
3111700	3112700	Yeah!
3112700	3118260	For the first time in Donovan's life, he is alert to his surroundings.
3118260	3119260	Kind of.
3119260	3120260	I don't know if I bastardized.
3120260	3124540	Unfortunately, you only had five.
3124540	3125580	Your bass is 20, I think.
3125580	3128100	Thomas and Luke to leave the room.
3128100	3129580	Sayonara suckers.
3129580	3130580	Help.
3134660	3150980	Clark, you're holding Leon's phone in your hand and you feel a buzz in your pocket and
3150980	3156380	Donovan is standing right next to you and he hears the buzz from the phone in your pocket
3156380	3158900	and you guys make direct eye contact with each other.
3158900	3159900	You should answer that.
3159900	3161700	I'm, I'm going to, I'm going to take this, Donovan.
3161700	3162700	Yeah.
3162700	3163700	Give me a second.
3163740	3164740	I'm going to step away.
3164740	3165740	Okay.
3165740	3166740	Justin, get the fuck out of here.
3166740	3169820	Well, you can, I don't, I didn't necessarily mean that.
3169820	3172260	I kind of meant more from like the group, but.
3172260	3173260	Just close your ears.
3173260	3174260	Okay.
3174260	3175620	You get a text on your burner phone.
3175620	3179140	Do you remember what you had texted and what was texted back?
3179140	3180140	I can tell you right now.
3180140	3181620	If you can tell, I've get some of my notes.
3181620	3187420	The last two texts sent, you received a text that said the book your parents died for is
3187420	3190900	still hidden in an undisclosed location.
3190900	3199660	Then you texted back what book where, and this text says your book, calm, comfy campground.
3199660	3204460	I want to reply to this one with another, who is this, which I think I've already asked
3204460	3205900	before, but I'm doing it again.
3205900	3211780	You then receive a text on Leon's phone that says, fuck.
3211780	3212780	What did you do?
3212780	3216620	I replied back, I don't know.
3216620	3217620	Who is this?
3217860	3223460	Almost as soon as you send that text, both phones vibrate at the same time and they both
3223460	3225780	have the exact same response.
3225780	3229660	There's a single word reply, destiny.
3229660	3231180	I don't know anybody named destiny.
3247620	3268900	How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the
