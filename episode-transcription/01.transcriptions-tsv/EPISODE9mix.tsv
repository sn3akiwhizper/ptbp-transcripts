0	6320	Hello to all my friends and all my enemies, it's your boy Wolf the Dog growling at you
6320	12420	from Contention's best radio station, 694.2 PTBP.
12420	17200	It's time for our first segment, the unveiling of Howlin' with Wolf, where we get to hear
17200	21600	from y'all, my pups, my babies, my children.
21600	27540	I'm only doing this out of the love in my big ole wolf heart, sharing airtime, fuck,
27540	29460	but my pups are that important.
29460	33100	Alright let's kick it off with this one from an anonymous listener.
33100	36340	Dear V-cell, do not enter the mirror room.
36340	39560	Do not let John enter the mirror room.
39560	41500	Destroy the mirror room.
41500	43340	Destroy Orotech.
43340	45020	Destroy John.
45020	46540	Destroy the world.
46540	50140	Dear V-cell, nothing is real and everything is alive.
50140	53260	The end has come and will come and come again.
53260	55300	Find my bones, hear it and see.
55300	56660	No, wait for me.
56660	59780	I'm coming, but time moves so slowly.
59780	66140	Wow, uh, that's uh, that's real something y'all.
66140	71220	So if you want me to read whatever crazy horseshit you gotta say, submit a 5 star review on your
71220	77880	podcast app, screenshot that shit and send it to us, or tag us on social media, at pretending
77880	82880	pod on instagram and twitter, pretending to be people on facebook.
82880	84780	Now let's hear some news y'all.
84780	89840	Last time, the roving gang of tunnel vision cops left Mildred Mitchell, sans granddaughter
89840	91620	and information.
91620	96020	They went to Forgotten Treasures and bullied the nice lady there until she put her own
96020	100660	life in danger by telling the cops about the drunk man who threatened her.
100660	105660	Upon leaving, the white Toyota they'd been searching for peeled out onto the road.
105660	111860	After a short, dangerous pursuit, Keith Vigna gunned down Charles Donovan and John Lee Pettymore
111860	116900	fired warning shots into the air as well as Clark's tires, and they found a bald man
116900	118580	tied up in that old trunk.
118580	121500	I'm surprised they didn't shoot this old boy too.
121500	127300	Keith is riding with the bald man to the clinic as he is unconscious and in critical condition.
127300	131860	Wolf wants his pack to keep this old boy in your singing bowls.
131860	140860	Now rub your hands together so fast it makes a weird sound for kudzu with no backbone.
140860	164780	Is he still bound in that chain?
164780	167820	I'm gonna try to take the chain off and put like actual handcuffs on him.
167820	168820	Okay good.
168820	169820	Zip tie.
169820	170820	Citizen's arrest style.
170820	172820	You can never break the chain.
172820	176700	Alright Keith you are in the ambulance.
176700	183620	You have replaced Billy Harrison's chain with handcuffs and you guys are heading to the
183620	184620	clinic.
184620	189860	I want to ask one of the paramedics back there, hey is there anything you know maybe for this
189860	194940	pain in my foot so maybe I can I know I'm supposed to keep off of it but you know in
194940	197800	case I ever need to be on it like stay in the pain.
197800	201320	No pun intended.
201320	206360	I don't I don't know if I'm supposed to just give out medication.
206360	207520	Who's gonna get you in trouble?
207520	209960	I'm a police officer.
209960	211200	I'm gonna get you in trouble.
211200	213200	I'm a police officer.
213200	216040	Gotcha bitch.
216040	221880	Are you saying this to a terrified like 19 year old EMT?
221880	223360	Roll Persuade.
223360	224360	Nice.
224360	227480	13 on a 70.
227480	230560	Oh my god.
230560	234080	Um yeah okay just uh.
234080	238920	Shh this is our secret.
238920	243600	Like the crazed look in your eye right now is like you actually are like intimidating
243600	245680	some of your drugs.
245680	247160	You look so scary.
247160	248800	Yeah I guess you could.
248800	251880	And he reaches into a bag of pills.
251880	254800	Yeah he just pulls out a handful.
254800	257800	He's like take one to four of these.
257800	260120	What did they do?
260120	264000	Roll a D4 and see how many you take.
264000	266000	I take D6 again.
266000	268560	I'm a cheater.
268560	269560	Take one.
269560	272360	I take one.
272360	273360	What does it do?
273360	276640	It's not effective when you take one.
276640	277640	It's Oxycontin.
277640	281680	He just gives you like a bottle full of Oxycontin.
281680	283600	Can I want to ask you if I take these?
283600	287800	I'm thinking I probably get a plus to something and a minus to something if I take one.
287800	288800	Yeah.
288800	291760	Can you tell me what that is right now before I take one?
291760	295760	So your trap rap game is now off the hook.
295760	300600	I am the least knowledgeable about prescription drugs but if he's actually in pain won't it
300600	302720	do good more than it does detriment?
302720	304040	Like it'll attack pain receptors?
304040	306760	It'll do more good for the pain than...
306760	307760	But I don't think...
307760	308760	But he's gonna be...
308760	309760	Like he's not using it recreationally.
309760	310760	I'm gonna be on Oxycontin.
310760	316520	He's gonna be like every housewife you know but don't realize.
316520	318440	They're all so happy.
318440	319440	Fake happy.
319440	320720	Who does that?
320720	321720	Fake happy.
321720	322720	Don't worry.
322720	323720	Oh shit.
323720	324720	Fake happy.
324720	327680	Okay I'm looking up the side effects of Oxycontin.
327680	328680	Like you'll be loopy right?
328680	329680	Yeah you'll be a bit loopy.
329680	330680	You'll be a little scratchy.
330680	333280	Kind of a little bit of a goof.
333280	334280	And maybe sleepy.
334280	336680	I mean like if I take like one...
336680	338680	Fake happy is by Paramore.
338680	339680	Okay.
339680	340680	Awesome.
340680	350400	Common side effects of Oxycontin include constipation, nausea, stomach pain, loss of appetite, vomiting,
350400	354960	sleepiness, tiredness, drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, weakness, itching, headache,
354960	358200	dry mouth, sweating, and decreases the ability to feel pain.
358200	360040	Ask your doctor if you want some.
360400	368520	Okay I'll keep these for later but I'm probably gonna take them all the time sparingly.
368520	371240	Alright Clark and John what do you guys want to do?
371240	373920	Check out Dr. Marie Jacobs.
373920	375680	See where she fits into this mystery.
375680	377840	What was the doctor's scrubs we got?
377840	378840	Zaboomafoo?
378840	379840	Zabrowski.
379840	380840	Dr. Zaboomafoo.
380840	382480	Doctor between the lions.
382480	386660	Dr. Marie Jacobs was she in contention or was she in the city?
386660	387660	She's in contention.
387660	388660	Do I know her?
388660	389660	Have I heard of her?
390280	391280	Do I know anything about her?
391280	393280	She's Clark's ex-wife.
393280	397780	No you probably wouldn't have any reason to know her.
397780	402100	She's got a private practice and that's all you know about her.
402100	403760	Family practitioner.
403760	410620	You do have an address and she lives in the suburbs which is in the northeast part of
410620	411620	town.
411620	414100	Are you taking both vehicles there?
414100	415100	Probably yeah.
415100	416100	Let's get a burger first.
416100	417100	Okay.
417100	418100	What is the burger place called?
418100	419100	Burgatory?
419540	422380	It's on the other side of the highway.
422380	425540	It's like five minutes out of your way if you want to hop up there and grab a burger.
425540	426540	Yeah.
426540	427540	Yeah.
427540	432060	I kind of need a, you know, in the salon I work you can't take like too many mental
432060	436300	health days off, but I need a mental health hour after watching Charles explode all over
436300	437300	that work.
437300	438300	For sure.
438300	439300	Frosty root beer.
439300	440300	That might soak me all right.
440300	441300	All right.
441300	448400	So you guys grab some grub and then you head down back into town into the, yeah.
448400	449400	Number one.
449400	450400	Burger.
450400	453200	Oh, I'll have that.
453200	454840	Number two.
454840	455840	Vegan burger.
455840	456840	We have a vegan burger.
456840	457840	Absolutely not that.
457840	458840	Yeah.
458840	459840	I already ordered some.
459840	460840	I'm not reading anymore.
460840	461840	Number three.
461840	462840	Oh, I don't want to even hear this.
462840	463840	Yeah.
463840	465840	I'm editing all that up.
465840	472160	I remember when we ordered waffle house for 30 minutes.
472160	474000	Do they really not have pancakes at waffle house?
474000	475000	No.
475000	476000	No, they don't.
476000	477000	That's fucking crazy.
477000	479200	I just kept trying to order pancakes.
479200	480200	It makes sense though.
480200	483960	They don't like covered in some other for your browns and capped.
483960	486160	Capped is what Charles is now.
486160	487160	He's covered in mushrooms.
487160	489160	He's covered in mushrooms.
489160	495520	Well, eventually he would be since we probably buried him on the side of the roof.
495520	498360	Does Dr. Marie Jacobs run her practice out of her home?
498360	499360	No.
499360	500360	Is it midday?
500360	501360	Will she be at the clinic?
501360	504160	I feel like we should go to go to her wherever she is.
504160	506360	No, that like the sun just went down.
506360	507360	Okay.
507360	508360	Then yeah, we'll head to her house.
508360	513920	On the way to Dr. Marie Jacobs home, you guys pull onto our street in the suburbs.
513920	519200	And as you are going down the street, you see kind of off to the right.
519200	524520	There's a man with extremely unkempt hair and facial hair standing in his front yard,
524520	529560	wearing a white tank top under some like rubber looking waders.
529560	536120	And he is messing with a vacuum, holding the hose with one hand and pointing the wand like
536520	542080	of the vacuum cleaner to the ground, kind of like he's challenging his yard to a duel.
542080	547640	And he begins to hold the wand with both hands and his arms shake violently up and down and
547640	553080	all around before he drops the vacuum wand and begins sprinting out into the street in
553080	557040	front of your car, not even paying attention to you whatsoever.
557040	558040	What do you want to do?
558040	561400	I was texting, so I just run him down.
561400	564200	Did you say, did you say it was vacuum like or it was a vacuum?
564200	565200	It was a vacuum.
565280	569240	I was messing with that like hose wand thing that comes off the side.
569240	571560	And it doesn't look like a fucked up vacuum.
571560	572560	It's just a normal vacuum.
572560	573560	No, normal vacuum.
573560	576520	I wrote down disheveled man vacuuming his yard, so let's just keep going.
576520	577520	Okay.
577520	578520	Yeah.
578520	583600	So yeah, I slam on the brakes and I say, sir, this might sound crazy, but were you trying
583600	587440	to vacuum an oil creature out of this guy?
587440	589160	He's like running away.
589160	592240	He has not even paid any attention to you whatsoever.
592280	597600	As you slammed on the brakes, he begins running down the street as he's running.
597600	604320	He begins to float off the ground and his legs are still flailing in a desperate gate
604320	605320	roll sanity.
605320	608160	Man, you really don't want us to see Marie Jacobs.
608160	616520	I pass nine on a 52 47 on a 53 neither one of you lose any sanity.
616520	621640	Basically you think maybe it's the air currents from the,
622040	623040	he must be a Poppins.
623040	624040	Yeah.
624040	630360	Perhaps he has jumped very high, but what you do see is a young boy and girl standing
630360	633720	in their front yard across the street and their jaws are dropped.
633720	641760	They failed the rules hard and they are watching this dude as he begins to float into the air.
641760	644400	So what do you do?
644400	645680	How far in the air is he?
645680	646680	Two feet.
646680	649080	Like I run up and I try to pull him back down.
649080	650080	Okay.
650080	654200	Is not coming down.
654200	658440	You are actively fighting against a force that you cannot see Clark.
658440	659440	What do you do?
659440	666600	I grabbed the other leg, his pants fall down.
666600	677320	So I need you guys to both a roll strength pass 23 on a 65 fail 76 on a 50 John, you
677320	680760	lose grip and slide down his leg.
680760	686600	As you are pulling on his shoe, as he kind of begins to get higher, you pull a shoe off
686600	693480	of his foot and Clark, you are holding him, but you feel a force actively lifting him
693480	694480	upward.
694480	697440	He is three feet off the ground at this point.
697440	701640	And you are the only thing holding him from floating away.
701640	703040	And he is screaming.
703040	704040	Oh, Holy.
704040	710360	Oh, you have to, you have to get the, get the, get the shit, get the fucking, get the
710360	712360	vacuum, get the vacuum.
712360	713360	I turned to John.
713360	714360	John, get the vacuum.
714360	715360	He says, get the vacuum.
715360	717080	I turned to those kids across the street.
717080	718080	Kids get the vacuum.
718080	723680	The two kids run and grab the vacuum from this man's yard.
723680	729160	I'm kind of like, I'm overseeing the children now I'm as I'm in a supervisory role.
729160	730160	Yeah.
730160	733280	I mean, you're delegating right there, right there.
733920	744280	And, uh, these two children, uh, are running over with the vacuum on an extension cord
744280	748400	that is like extremely long and they're bringing it out into the street.
748400	756560	Clark, I need you to roll strength for me one more time here, 46 on a 65 while I'm holding
756560	757560	onto them.
757560	758560	We got, we got you, bud.
758560	759560	They're coming with the vacuum.
759960	763080	Get the, get my feet, my feet, it's all around.
763080	764080	It's all around.
764080	765280	It's everywhere.
765280	766280	What is it bud?
766280	767280	What is it?
767280	775440	And these kids bring the vacuum to you, John suck, suck those feet up right there.
775440	778040	Just put that hose to his feet.
778040	779040	You two are heroes.
779040	781520	How old are these children?
781520	783200	They're like nine.
783200	784200	Both of them.
784200	785200	Yeah.
785200	792240	So the girl is holding the wand and the little boy is holding the vacuum, like hugging it,
792240	793240	like holding it up.
793240	795200	And he reaches over and flicks it on.
795200	801520	And the girl holds the one kind of up to this man's feet and they're both like, yeah, what
801520	802520	do we do?
802520	804000	You're doing great kids.
804000	812240	But is this, why, why is how you stop people from flying now?
812240	813240	Keep going.
813280	815800	I'm making you both honorary deputies.
815800	817160	You're vacuuming the hell out of that.
817160	818160	This man's shoes.
818160	819160	Just keep going.
819160	824880	Do we have fake badges at the police station?
824880	826600	I was already thinking that I've got them in my car.
826600	830240	I've got little that I hand out to kids.
830240	833520	The wand starts to move in jagged motions.
833520	836440	Oh my God, there's something.
836440	839440	I'm sucking up something.
843640	844640	No.
844640	845640	No, yeah.
845640	846640	I can't do this.
846640	853840	I think it was worse with the hand gestures, but it might play better on audio.
853840	859640	But that was, uh, yeah, John, John very quickly like grabs the end of the hose and was like,
859640	860640	you're doing great.
860640	863840	I got that from here.
863840	869640	The boy holding the vacuum is like, I can feel it too.
869640	871640	It's inside now.
874240	875240	What are you?
875240	876240	What are your names?
876240	877240	I'm Aiden.
877240	878240	Aiden.
878240	879240	I'm Aiden.
879240	882240	And she's, I don't know.
882240	883240	Like yeah.
883240	884240	Brooke.
884240	885240	No.
885240	886240	Brooke is a decent.
886240	888240	What's like a millennial's kid's name.
888240	891240	Kids in contention probably still have good biblical names.
891240	892240	Yeah.
892240	894240	They're, they're not worried about their names right now.
894240	895240	Yeah.
895240	896240	They are.
896240	897240	Cutback.
897240	898240	Cutback.
898240	905640	Clark, you actually feel the pressure is releasing and it is easier to hold this guy closer to
905640	906640	the ground.
906640	907640	And he is looking down.
907640	909640	He's like, you're doing it.
909640	911740	Oh, you're doing it.
911740	916240	Clark is feeling really good about being able to pull him down.
916240	917240	I'm strong.
917240	921240	John is watching all this like hands on hip satisfied like, yes, team.
921240	922240	Yes.
922240	925240	Clark, you get him all the way to the ground and he just begins sprinting.
925240	926240	He is sprinting.
926240	927240	He's like, run.
927240	928240	Run.
928240	929240	Run away.
929240	930240	Run.
930240	932240	Can I do a check that I don't let him go?
932240	933240	Yeah, absolutely.
933240	935240	You can roll strength or unarmed combat.
935240	937240	I'm using my unarmed combat skill.
937240	938240	Okay.
938240	939240	I pass.
939240	940240	53 on a 70.
940240	941240	He rolled an aught.
941240	942240	Aught.
942240	943240	It's a critical fail.
943240	944240	It's a critical fail.
944240	945240	His legs fall.
945240	949240	So you can do whatever you want to him.
949240	956240	I want to grab him, like bear around the shoulders and pull him to like the nearest lawn.
956240	960240	I just want to get him away from that area that he was floating in and off the road.
960240	964240	And then if he's still struggling, I want to get him to the ground.
964240	969240	Okay, yeah, you can get him to the ground and you're holding him and he's still screaming
969240	971240	like, get away from me.
971240	972240	Get away.
972240	976240	Now I need both of you guys to roll sanity for me.
976240	977240	Fail.
977240	979240	62 on a 53.
979240	981240	61 on a 52.
981240	982240	I also fail.
982240	985240	You guys are both going to lose a D4.
985240	987240	Oh, fuck.
987240	988240	Four.
988240	989240	Two.
989240	991240	So my sanity is now at 50.
991240	994240	Mine's at 49 and I'm one away from my breaking point.
994240	996240	I am two away from mine.
996240	1003240	You guys can actually see on the street where you were, flashing in your vision is a thin
1003240	1008240	layer of this viscous, like writhing ooze.
1008240	1014240	And it is moving down the street into one of those drainage.
1014240	1015240	Storm drain.
1015240	1016240	Yeah.
1016240	1019240	Off the side of the road where the sidewalk meets.
1019240	1024240	And all of the ooze that was on the street is going down that drain.
1024240	1025240	What happens when you shoot it?
1025240	1027240	I shoot it.
1027240	1028240	Okay.
1028240	1030240	Kids, get out of the way.
1030240	1033240	And roll firearms.
1033240	1035240	67 on a 60.
1035240	1037240	Okay, so you just fire a few shots.
1037240	1039240	Those kids are dead.
1039240	1041240	I told them to get out of the way.
1041240	1042240	The kids both like completely-
1042240	1045240	Probably think it's pretty cool to see a cop she's killing, right?
1045240	1048240	They're completely blank faced and they're backing away.
1048240	1051240	The boy is still holding the vacuum.
1051240	1054240	Hey, junior deputies, get back here.
1054240	1055240	Drop that vacuum, first of all.
1055240	1059240	And as the two of them are being talked to by you,
1059240	1064240	you see the bag on this vacuum just explodes.
1064240	1071240	And you see both of these kids are immediately just covered in this black viscous goo.
1071240	1073240	They are gone.
1073240	1079240	Not necessarily from your vision because you can currently see this mass of ooze.
1079240	1088240	So more so you see the limbs of these kids inside of this ooze struggling to get out.
1088240	1094240	God, I mean it's so dark that it seems to dampen the brightness of everything around it,
1094240	1096240	all the lights shining down and stuff.
1096240	1104240	And it kind of melts down into the ground and begins slowly at first,
1104240	1107240	but surely gaining speed flowing toward you, John.
1107240	1108240	What do you do?
1108240	1112240	Do kids count as one kill or half a kill?
1112240	1115240	John just got two kills.
1115240	1119240	Also go ahead and roll sanity.
1119240	1123240	No way. Yeah, 92 on a 49.
1123240	1125240	So this is going to be a breaking point moment.
1125240	1127240	I critically fail.
1127240	1129240	66.
1129240	1133240	John, roll a D6, cut it in half and add four.
1133240	1136240	Oh, fuck.
1136240	1137240	Okay, cool.
1137240	1138240	Five.
1138240	1140240	Clark, you lose seven.
1140240	1141240	So that's a breaking point for me.
1141240	1142240	Same.
1142240	1144240	Also, man, I am bonkers now.
1144240	1145240	What are you down to?
1145240	1146240	44.
1146240	1147240	That's not too bad.
1147240	1148240	I have 40.
1148240	1149240	I'm at 43.
1149240	1150240	I'm fucking crazy.
1150240	1151240	What accent was that?
1151240	1153240	It was all of them.
1153240	1155240	I was doing all of them.
1155240	1157240	How do you calculate the new breaking point?
1157240	1159240	Okay, so yeah, let's do that real quick.
1159240	1161240	Keith Vigna, you're at 40, correct?
1161240	1165240	I'm at 40 and my last breaking point was 40, so how do I do my new breaking point?
1165240	1170240	Right, so yours is easy because your power is 10, so you just subtract your power from
1170240	1171240	your current sanity.
1171240	1174240	So what's 40 minus 10?
1174240	1180240	Clark, your sanity is currently 43 and your power is 12, so your new breaking point is
1180240	1181240	31.
1181240	1187240	And John Lee Pettymore, your sanity is 44 and your power is 12, which means your breaking
1187240	1189240	point is 32.
1189240	1194240	Hitting your breaking point will begin to change your character through the use of a
1194240	1200240	new disorder that your character has gained and it will affect your willpower.
1200240	1203240	I will discuss this off-microphone with you.
1203240	1207240	I feel like John's definitely going to be a lot less cavalier with the lives of children
1207240	1209240	after this incident.
1209240	1215240	It's too late to try to vacuum them out of it.
1215240	1221240	You kept describing how horrible it was and I was like, I want to vacuum, but I guess
1221240	1223240	I hit my breaking point and froze.
1224240	1225240	Losing that much sanity?
1225240	1226240	10 or 5.
1226240	1229240	I've lost 9 this session.
1229240	1235240	I need you to roll against your power in order to act.
1235240	1238240	And hey, this is really important.
1238240	1240240	58 out of 60.
1240240	1243240	You lucky son of a bitch.
1243240	1249240	As this flowing dark ooze is moving toward you, you can move.
1249240	1251240	I'd die for the vacuum.
1251240	1252240	Oh, the bag burst.
1252240	1253240	Yup.
1253240	1255240	Yeah, I run.
1258240	1266240	Yeah, this guy in Clark's arms is freaking the fuck out and he's like, no, I fucking
1266240	1268240	told you to run.
1268240	1270240	I don't know.
1270240	1271240	And Clark, what are you doing?
1271240	1274240	I'm like, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
1274240	1276240	I'm getting up and running.
1276240	1279240	Maybe following wherever he runs, but running away.
1279240	1282240	Oh, we should run to our cruisers.
1282240	1283240	No, I'm sorry.
1283240	1286240	I want to follow the guy who's been sucked up in the air.
1286240	1287240	See where he's running.
1287240	1291240	No, I know, but maybe we should get in off foot.
1291240	1293240	This thing seems quick.
1293240	1299240	Okay, so he begins to run down the street away from you and also toward Marie Jacobs'
1299240	1300240	house.
1300240	1305240	John, do you want to head to your cruiser or are you following after this unkempt man
1305240	1308240	and Clark Bishop as they haul?
1308240	1313240	Are they running down like an alley or the road?
1313240	1314240	What was that?
1314240	1317240	I was going to say hot footed or something.
1317240	1319240	I don't know what I was going to say.
1319240	1321240	Hot footed is a weird thing.
1321240	1325240	I was like, hot footed?
1325240	1327240	What do you want to do?
1327240	1329240	Are they running down a street or alley?
1329240	1331240	They're running down the street in the suburbs.
1331240	1332240	It's honestly a nice neighborhood.
1332240	1333240	Yeah.
1333240	1338240	I get in my cruiser and I take off after him with the ultimate goal of collecting them
1338240	1340240	both and getting to Julie's.
1340240	1341240	Jacobs?
1341240	1342240	Yes.
1342240	1350240	As you get in your cruiser, you'd see this writhing mass and it disappears from your
1350240	1351240	vision.
1351240	1353240	I mean, it was there.
1353240	1355240	It didn't move anywhere.
1355240	1358240	It was moving, yes, at the time, but it didn't move out of your sight.
1358240	1360240	It just disappeared and you can't see it anymore.
1360240	1361240	I'm not afraid of silly putty.
1361240	1362240	I'm not afraid of silly putty.
1362240	1363240	I'm not afraid of silly putty.
1363240	1369240	You hop in your car, take off down the street, and make it to Clark Bishop and this unkempt
1369240	1373240	man wearing a white tank top and rubber-like waders.
1373240	1378240	You look to your right and you see the address for Dr. Marie Jacobs' house.
1378240	1395780	Keith Vigna, you are at the clinic in contention where the ambulance has brought you as well
1395780	1396780	as Billy-
1396780	1397780	Billie.
1397780	1398780	Was that his name?
1398780	1399780	Billy Harrison.
1399780	1400780	Billy Harrison.
1400780	1408420	And you are standing in a hallway waiting and a doctor comes to you and lets you know
1408420	1410820	that he has woken up.
1410820	1412940	He has a concussion.
1412940	1420060	He took a pretty huge blow to the back of his head and he was unconscious for quite
1420060	1427540	an amount of time, which leads them to believe something might have gone wrong neurologically.
1427540	1431880	So they did some scans, they're waiting on the report back, but he is currently awake
1431880	1436080	and you can go talk to him and he's cuffed to the bed.
1436080	1442120	As you walk into the room, he is laying in the bed, one cuff, yep, onto the bed.
1442120	1445740	Is he like hostile or is he just like kind of confused?
1445740	1447060	He's just sitting there.
1447060	1452820	I'm gonna go into the room and, hey, Billy, uh, do you know where you are right now?
1452820	1454220	He kind of looks around.
1454220	1455220	H-h-hospital.
1455220	1460140	Yeah, so you're in the contention hospital.
1460140	1461980	My name is O-Officer Vigna.
1461980	1463460	I have a couple questions for you.
1463460	1464460	You're not in trouble.
1464460	1466340	He kind of moves his hand.
1466340	1472040	Yeah, I think, uh, so you suffered a concussion, so you might be a little confused, but I just
1472040	1477500	want to set a timeline of what you remember meeting up to what I know.
1477500	1479540	Does that make sense to you?
1479540	1480540	Yeah.
1480540	1483460	Okay, so can you tell me your name?
1483500	1485580	Billy Harrison.
1485580	1488920	Do you know where you are right now?
1488920	1491260	You said contention.
1491260	1492660	We're in contention.
1492660	1494140	Are you from contention?
1494140	1495140	No.
1495140	1496140	Where are you from?
1496140	1506120	I'm from, I'm, I'm from, I, I don't remember.
1506120	1507500	Do you know how old you are?
1507500	1512500	I'm 31.
1512820	1513820	I'm 31.
1513820	1514820	Close enough.
1514820	1518340	What is the last thing you remember before you remember talking to me?
1518340	1522260	I was, I went to my friend John's.
1522260	1523260	John?
1523260	1525260	Uh, Peters.
1525260	1526260	John Peters.
1526260	1527260	How do you know John Peters?
1527260	1529820	We were in the army together?
1529820	1533300	No, I'm, I was in the army.
1533300	1534820	We're just friends.
1534820	1537300	So John Peters was not in the army with you?
1537300	1538900	I don't think so.
1538900	1541220	No, he's an old friend.
1541220	1542220	Okay.
1542220	1544780	Do you remember why you went over to his house?
1544780	1548940	He, he, he hadn't responded.
1548940	1552020	He hadn't responded to any of my messages.
1552020	1553020	And how long?
1553020	1555100	A couple of days.
1555100	1556500	I tried calling him.
1556500	1557820	Yeah, I tried calling him.
1557820	1559580	He didn't, he didn't respond.
1559580	1560980	I got worried about him.
1560980	1563260	How often do you usually see John?
1563260	1565860	I don't see him very often.
1565860	1568840	Or how do you, how often do you keep in contact with him?
1568840	1570220	We talk a lot.
1570220	1572020	We play video games together.
1572020	1573020	Okay.
1573020	1575860	He didn't respond long enough for you to be worried about him.
1575860	1576860	Right?
1576860	1577860	And that's why you went and checked on him?
1577860	1581260	Yeah, I was on my way through town.
1581260	1582740	Did you get to his house?
1582740	1583740	Yeah.
1583740	1585460	And did you talk to him?
1585460	1587220	No, he wasn't there.
1587220	1591260	I was, I was looking in, something happened at his house.
1591260	1594020	Did you look into the windows or did you get into his house?
1594020	1596660	I was looking in the window.
1596660	1600380	That's that's the last thing you remember or can you think any harder?
1600380	1601380	Is there anything?
1601380	1605180	Have you seen anybody in the house or do you remember anybody coming up to you?
1605180	1610140	No, I was looking through the window and now I'm here?
1610140	1611580	What happened?
1611580	1615100	Do you know a man by the name of Charles Donovan?
1615100	1616500	No.
1616500	1623380	Okay, so what's happened here is that we were chasing after a man named Charles and we found
1623380	1629700	you tied up in the back of his car and he gave you, he must have hit you with something
1629700	1633700	while you were looking through John's house or looking into John's house and he gave you
1633700	1638700	a concussion and that's why you're here just for some tests and some just surveying to
1638700	1644880	see what your health is like but do you know any one that would have wanted to hurt John?
1644880	1650620	Did John ever talk about any enemies or any people he might have owed a debt to or anything
1650620	1654440	that he might have been caught up with?
1654440	1656540	Any kind of trouble that he was in?
1656540	1658940	No, not that I can think of.
1658940	1660860	What kind of video games did you play with him?
1660860	1663220	Online or with him?
1663220	1664220	Online.
1664220	1667980	So did he ever tell you much about his personal life?
1667980	1674660	I mean we just knew each other growing up and stayed in touch because we both played
1674660	1675660	Call of Duty.
1675660	1676660	Okay.
1676660	1679340	Do you know anybody that drives a white Toyota?
1679340	1680340	I mean...
1680340	1681340	What kind of car do you drive?
1681340	1682340	Probably.
1682340	1684020	Let me start over.
1684020	1688580	What kind of car do you, what car did you drive to John's house?
1688580	1690340	White van.
1690340	1691340	White van.
1691340	1692340	Okay.
1692340	1695620	And when did you go over to John's house?
1695620	1697140	The third?
1697140	1698140	What day is it?
1698140	1699140	Today's the third.
1699140	1700140	Thank god.
1700140	1701220	About what time did you get there?
1701220	1702540	I don't remember.
1702540	1705740	I think the sun was up.
1705740	1706820	How late is it?
1706820	1708820	It's about eight o'clock in the evening.
1708820	1712140	So had you eaten lunch before you went or?
1712140	1713140	Yeah.
1713140	1715940	Okay, so early afternoon probably.
1715940	1716940	Yeah.
1716940	1717940	So about six.
1718300	1719300	Okay.
1719300	1720300	About six hours you've been out.
1720300	1721300	Oh god.
1721300	1722300	Um.
1722300	1723300	That's really bad for you, isn't it?
1723300	1725540	Well, we'll let the doctors decide that.
1725540	1726540	I'm not a doctor.
1726540	1728820	I'm just a very good police officer.
1728820	1729820	So you can trust me.
1729820	1731600	You can tell me anything that you want.
1731600	1733580	What kind of line of work are you in now?
1733580	1736540	I'm on leave from the army.
1736540	1737540	Okay.
1737540	1742260	You don't happen to know anybody that works at a dog grooming facility, do you?
1742260	1744260	You're asking some weird questions.
1744260	1748540	I know these sound weird, but you've got a concussion, so you might not.
1748540	1750020	None of these questions are weird.
1750020	1752020	You just might think they are.
1752020	1753020	Okay.
1753020	1756540	I don't know anyone who works at a dog grooming establishment.
1756540	1757540	Okay.
1757540	1762340	I guess, uh, you know, I, I got, I'll give you some rest and I'll talk to the doctor
1762340	1763340	to see how you're doing.
1763340	1768380	I'll, I'll let you, I'll leave you to it and kind of moves his hand with the handcuff on
1768380	1769380	it.
1769380	1772540	Is this still necessary?
1772540	1781580	Kind of feel like I was the victim and I mean, you're not treating me like I'm arrested.
1781580	1786260	No, you're not under arrest, but I'm, I'm going to stick around here at the clinic until
1786260	1788380	I get word from the doctor that you're okay.
1788380	1793780	Um, you know, we don't want you getting up and walking off and you know, dying out there.
1793780	1796620	Yeah, that makes sense.
1796620	1797740	Okay.
1797740	1808020	Well then can you at least take this off for now?
1808020	1809620	I don't, I don't know about that.
1809620	1814100	I am I under arrest?
1814100	1815700	Should I put you under arrest?
1815700	1817980	No, sorry, sir.
1817980	1822060	You've been pretty cooperative so far, but you're making me question whether I should
1822060	1824120	be done with this interview.
1824120	1826580	Why were you at John Peter's house for real?
1826580	1828220	I was just checking.
1828220	1831540	You were checking on your friend that you play video games with?
1831540	1834500	Yeah, I thought he might be in trouble.
1834500	1836660	Why would you think that he was in trouble?
1836660	1839980	There's times where I text my friends and they don't text me back or call me back for
1839980	1844340	a couple of days and it's for no reason, especially my close friends.
1844340	1846660	I don't know about if you're that close with him.
1846660	1851380	Tell me why you were at John Peter's house and I pull out my other pair of handcuffs
1851380	1857180	and handcuff his other hand to the other side of the bed.
1857180	1858180	Out of game.
1858180	1861300	Is this something I should pursue or am I wasting time?
1861300	1863500	You can do anything you want.
1863500	1864860	Here's what we're going to do.
1864860	1876180	As you walk up to his bed with the other pair of handcuffs, I need you to roll unarmed combat.
1876180	1880700	I got a 54 on a 40 and he got a success.
1880700	1890020	So as you approach him in one swift motion, he pulls your gun from your holster and immediately
1890020	1896580	has it drawn on you and he says, uncuff my hand right now or I'm going to shoot you.
1896580	1900860	Can I roll humant to see if he is just scared or...
1900860	1901860	Absolutely.
1901860	1902860	40 on 80.
1902860	1910160	Yeah, not only is he not scared in this moment at all, it looks like he has done this before
1910160	1913480	and he is going to shoot you.
1913480	1917440	What would I roll?
1917440	1922720	I'm thinking of like, I want to like jump and just tase him, but I like, do I have the,
1922720	1926760	I'm thinking I have a taser gun, but do I have like a stick it in his neck kind of taser?
1926760	1927760	Oh, I don't know.
1927760	1928760	You probably have the gun.
1928760	1930680	I think that's what they carry these days.
1930680	1933720	Hey Luke, he's going to shoot you.
1933720	1934720	Okay.
1934720	1940800	Okay, I put my hand up.
1940800	1941800	Okay.
1941800	1946520	I'm reaching down to my pot, to my, what do you call the little thing they wear?
1946520	1947520	Tactical belt.
1947520	1948520	Yeah.
1948520	1949520	Okay.
1949520	1951800	I'm reaching down to my belt to pull out the key.
1951800	1953080	Please don't shoot me.
1953080	1958200	He kind of moves the handcuff in a position to make it easy for you to unlock it.
1958200	1961600	I put the key in the lock, I twist it.
1961600	1962600	It unclicks.
1962600	1965880	I put the key back on my belt and the handcuffs are unlocked.
1965880	1969680	He says, turn around.
1969680	1971260	I turn around.
1971260	1973320	He stands up and he's behind you.
1973320	1980000	He's got the gun pressed firmly against the back of your head and he says, all right,
1980000	1981400	here's what we're going to do.
1981400	1982400	Fuck.
1982400	1983400	Okay.
1983400	1987960	I guess roll alertness for me.
1987960	1988960	Pass.
1988960	1990840	53 on a 60.
1990840	1991840	Okay.
1992080	1995360	72 and your lights go out.
2006880	2007880	All right.
2007880	2010680	Thomas and Joe.
2010680	2016600	John Lee Pettymore drives his cruiser down the road of the suburbs and makes it to where
2016600	2023000	Clark Bishop and this haggard looking man are running down the street and you guys kind
2023000	2028280	of slow down as you're looking behind you and the guy says, it's gone.
2028280	2030400	Oh, it's gone.
2030400	2031400	Yeah.
2031400	2033360	I can't, I can't see it either, man.
2033360	2035040	What the fuck was it?
2035040	2038120	Oh shit.
2038120	2039120	It's here.
2039120	2044900	And he turns and he kind of bends down and looks inside the cruiser and he sees John
2044900	2053820	Lee Pettymore and he backs up immediately and he's like, I can, what are you, what are
2053820	2054820	you?
2054820	2055820	And he looks at both of you.
2055820	2056820	He's like, what are you doing?
2056820	2060940	And he just fucking starts running back toward his house immediately.
2060940	2061940	Whoa, whoa.
2061940	2062940	Hey, but whoa.
2062940	2063940	And I'm trying to chase after him.
2063940	2065440	If I can get a hand on him.
2065440	2066440	You can get a hand.
2066440	2069500	I mean, do you want to like, he's, he's really trying to get away.
2069500	2071380	So I would just like to grab him so we can't get away.
2071380	2072380	Whatever that would take.
2072380	2073380	Yeah.
2073380	2075100	I mean, you could do unarmed combat or strength.
2075100	2077940	I'll do an armed combat.
2077940	2078940	Okay.
2078940	2081860	I fail fucking 91 on a 70.
2081860	2082860	Okay.
2082860	2083860	He passes.
2083860	2087780	So he gets away from you and he starts running down the street and he looks crazy.
2087780	2094540	I mean, this guy's wearing a white tank top with big rubber waders on and he's just like
2094540	2096100	hoofing it down the street.
2096100	2097100	I don't know.
2097100	2098100	Squeak, squeak, squeak.
2098100	2102060	Uh, yeah, I don't think I'm going to pursue.
2102060	2104020	I think I'll watch him run away.
2104020	2105020	Same.
2105020	2106020	Okay.
2106020	2107020	So he runs back to his house.
2107020	2108020	I know where he lives.
2108020	2113300	We, I, we know where you live.
2113300	2118780	He looks back over his shoulder, crazed the look in his eyes like dips into his house.
2118780	2119780	Cool.
2119780	2120780	All right.
2120780	2123460	So you guys are like right in front of the Jacobs home.
2123460	2129220	It's a beautiful modern home with a large front yard and a recessed interest entrance.
2129220	2135420	Just like every home on this street and in this neighborhood, you are in the suburbs.
2135420	2139940	Honestly this, this part of town seems a little nice for waiters, like the waiter guy, not
2139940	2140940	waiters.
2140940	2145820	This part of town does seem a little nice for waiters.
2145820	2149380	I mean, we've all, no servers live in this neighborhood.
2149380	2153180	We've all waited tables, but I'm realizing suddenly that it's a little weird roleplay
2153180	2157100	wise that we shrug our shoulders and go investigate Dr. Murray's house.
2157100	2159060	I don't know what you're talking about.
2159060	2163660	This seems convenient and perfect to me.
2163660	2165720	I don't feel great about those kids.
2165720	2168540	You know, they fucking, they're fucking gone.
2168540	2175200	All right, listen, Clark, we never saw two kids, but they were, they were just, you understand
2175200	2179660	that we cannot have like, we can't be on the hook for the death of two children.
2179660	2184100	Nobody's going to believe the crazy guy and the waiters.
2184100	2185740	There were never any kids.
2185740	2186740	Yeah.
2187380	2188380	Yeah, there weren't.
2188380	2195940	We don't know what happened to those two, those two, those two children.
2195940	2198340	There weren't, there weren't, there weren't, there weren't no children.
2198340	2199340	There were no children.
2199340	2202940	Let's uh, let's see what this doctor knows about our cases.
2202940	2204500	You guys mark up to the front door?
2204500	2205500	Yeah, I'll knock.
2205500	2207940	This is good knocking.
2207940	2213100	This is much better than Luke's.
2213100	2218660	You hear scuffling from inside and then you can like very clearly hear someone approaching
2218660	2223460	the door and you hear some heavy breathing, like right on the other side of the door.
2223460	2232800	It's just like Dr. Jacobs, we have a few questions for you now.
2232800	2234340	We'd just like to talk ma'am.
2234340	2237500	If you could just even open your door, we could just have a word with you right here.
2237500	2241300	We can talk through the door.
2241300	2244580	Go away ma'am.
2244580	2245580	We're the police.
2245580	2246980	We, we need to, we need to talk to you.
2246980	2247980	I know who you are.
2247980	2249980	You have a warrant?
2249980	2250980	Maybe.
2250980	2253740	Uh, we don't, we don't need a warrant to find out.
2253740	2255780	You can come back with a warrant.
2255780	2257140	No, that's not her voice.
2257140	2258140	I don't know.
2258140	2259140	Yeah.
2259140	2260140	Do you want to?
2260140	2261140	Yeah, I do.
2261140	2262140	Restart?
2262140	2263140	I do.
2263140	2264140	Okay.
2264140	2265140	She has a nicer house than that.
2265140	2266140	Yeah.
2266140	2267140	Fuck.
2267140	2268140	Contention PD.
2268140	2269140	Go away.
2269980	2271980	See, I thought you were going to go less witchy.
2271980	2272980	Yeah.
2272980	2273980	Nope.
2273980	2282040	John, it's a witch.
2282040	2283040	It's a witch.
2283040	2284040	What'd you say?
2284040	2285040	You said contingent PD?
2285040	2286040	Yeah.
2286040	2291040	Uh, we just, we just need to, I wasn't doing that, I didn't care.
2291040	2292040	Do you want me to say that?
2292040	2293040	Clark's mind is preoccupied.
2293040	2294040	What?
2294040	2295040	Did you just say contingent PD?
2295040	2298900	Uh, would you, uh, we just need to ask you some questions ma'am.
2299660	2300660	Okay.
2300660	2301660	Can you open the door for me?
2301660	2304300	You can ask your questions through the door.
2304300	2306140	Pausing the role play.
2306140	2307820	What do we want to ask her actually?
2307820	2308820	Yeah.
2308820	2312940	So her, she was just circled in the phone book at Julie Maxwell's place.
2312940	2315060	That's the only real lead we have to come here.
2315060	2316060	So maybe if she knows her.
2316060	2317260	I thought we had a couple other things though.
2317260	2321180	I thought other people had, I thought there were two or three vectors to her.
2321180	2322180	Nope.
2322180	2323180	I do have something else to her.
2323180	2324180	Oh, do you?
2324180	2325180	Yes.
2325180	2326180	Uh, she bought the radio from the treasure shop.
2326180	2327180	Yes.
2327180	2328180	That's important.
2328460	2329460	Good.
2329460	2330460	Good fucking call.
2330460	2331880	John and Thomas.
2331880	2339420	So then what do we want to ask her like, radio repair.
2339420	2340420	What were you saying?
2340420	2343780	I put it together in my head that Julie might've just circled her name in the phone book as
2343780	2346820	another person who bought a crazy item like her camera.
2346820	2350220	So she might not know who Julie Maxwell is either way.
2350220	2355340	Ma'am, we just wanted to, uh, did you purchase anything from the, uh, oh shit.
2355340	2356340	What's it called?
2356340	2357340	Sorry.
2357500	2361100	Did you purchase anything from forgotten treasures in the last, uh, let's say month.
2361100	2364420	I buy many things from forgotten treasures.
2364420	2367180	Did you happen to buy an old radio?
2367180	2370460	No.
2370460	2371460	We think you did.
2371460	2372700	And we're just kind of interested in it.
2372700	2373700	Go away.
2373700	2374700	You didn't do anything wrong.
2374700	2378020	We just, uh, we're just curious about that old radio you bought.
2378020	2379500	You want to open the door for us?
2379500	2380500	Why?
2380500	2381640	So we can take a look at that old thing.
2381640	2382640	It sounds cool.
2382640	2383640	It's not here.
2383640	2386060	Uh, where, where'd it go?
2386060	2387060	It's gone.
2387780	2388780	Did you sell it?
2388780	2389780	No.
2389780	2390780	What'd you fetch?
2390780	2391780	What kind of price you fetch for that?
2391780	2392780	Can I hement her to see if she's lying?
2392780	2393780	Yeah.
2393780	2394780	I do not pass.
2394780	2395780	83 out of 50.
2395780	2396780	You don't know.
2396780	2400820	Uh, so if you didn't sell it, why, why is it not here?
2400820	2402380	A man came and took it.
2402380	2403980	A man came and took your radio?
2403980	2404980	A man came and took it.
2404980	2406020	I'm sorry to hear that.
2406020	2407500	Did you get a good look at the guy?
2407500	2409460	We can, we can go and get that for you.
2409460	2410620	He said no cops.
2410620	2412020	Oh, we can be discreet.
2412020	2413100	Oh, can you?
2413100	2416060	Knocking on the door, yelling about radios.
2416060	2417800	Who's got us there?
2417800	2420060	We can be discreet from here on out for you.
2420060	2423260	It's a lot easier to be discreet when you let us inside, ma'am.
2423260	2425180	There's nothing here for you.
2425180	2426300	Go away.
2426300	2428020	Was that man John Peters?
2428020	2430160	I don't know who that is.
2430160	2431700	Can you describe the man who took that?
2431700	2432700	He was tall.
2432700	2433700	He was drunk.
2433700	2435740	He was very mean.
2435740	2437580	Did he break into your house to get that radio?
2437580	2438580	Yes.
2438580	2439940	Did you watch him carry it away?
2439940	2440940	He had a gun.
2440940	2442220	Did you see him drive off?
2442220	2443220	No.
2443220	2444220	Is he still here?
2444220	2445220	No.
2445380	2449300	He's gone, as is the radio that you so desperately desire.
2449300	2450300	I turned to John.
2450300	2453260	John, I mean a tall, drunk guy stealing a radio.
2453260	2455660	It's gotta be Charles, right?
2455660	2460980	There was the description of the menacing, drunk, mean guy with the gin blossoms.
2460980	2461980	That wasn't Charles, right?
2461980	2462980	I think it was.
2462980	2463980	Oh, okay.
2463980	2464980	Yeah, I think you're right.
2464980	2467380	Because he was at Treasure, fucking, what's it called?
2467380	2468380	Forgotten Treasures.
2468380	2470860	I'm forgetting the word forgotten.
2470860	2471860	He was at Forgotten Treasures.
2471860	2473620	He was drunk when I saw him.
2473620	2476020	It's gotta be Charles, and he's dead.
2476020	2478540	Well, we need to follow up on his hotel room, then.
2478540	2480380	He's staying at the same hotel as Vigna.
2480380	2481380	Go away.
2481380	2485660	Just to satisfy our curiosity while we're here, what kind of doctor are you?
2485660	2488340	I am a doctor.
2488340	2491340	I am a family doctor.
2491340	2492340	That's a noble profession.
2492340	2493340	Thank you, ma'am.
2493340	2494340	Thank you.
2494340	2495340	Okay.
2495340	2496340	Hey, Salem.
2496340	2497340	Oh, God.
2497340	2499300	I think she might be a witch.
2499300	2503100	As she says that, you kind of see, so she's got one of those doors that has the glass
2503100	2508260	pane at the top, and so you can see movement through there, and you didn't see any shape
2508260	2513500	or anything earlier when she came to the door, but there is kind of the shape of a taller
2513500	2516420	person there, and she's like, I have to go.
2516420	2519860	If you would like to continue talking, I will be back post-haste.
2519860	2522060	Ma'am, is there somebody in there with you?
2522060	2524060	Clark, I don't think we need a warrant anymore.
2524060	2525780	I think we have reasonable ...
2525780	2533540	You know the words.
2533540	2535540	Okay.
2535540	2540300	We can't start doing takes and shit, though.
2540300	2543900	Clark, I think we have reasonable ...
2543900	2550540	John, are you trying to say reasonable suspicion?
2550540	2551540	I sure am, Clark.
2551540	2552540	I think we might as well.
2552540	2553540	All right.
2553540	2554540	I kick down the door.
2555540	2556540	Okay.
2556540	2559540	Go ahead and roll law.
2559540	2561540	How about that?
2561540	2562540	35 on a 50.
2562540	2564540	Yeah, you've done this before.
2564540	2565540	You know how to do it.
2565540	2566540	Okay.
2566540	2568540	I mean, they train you how to kick in a door.
2568540	2569540	For sure.
2569540	2571540	I figured it would be a strength test.
2571540	2573540	Not like a cop test, but I like it.
2573540	2575540	I'm trying to change things up.
2575540	2578540	The cop test was so that you knew you were in the right to do this.
2578540	2579540	Exactly.
2579540	2583540	You had the force of the law behind your kick.
2583540	2586540	So, I've kicked down the door at gun drawn.
2586540	2591540	We're here to protect you, doctor.
2591540	2594540	You kick in the door and you immediately see the house.
2594540	2596540	The house is a complete wreck.
2596540	2597540	It smells weird in here.
2597540	2601540	There's a haze in the air, but she's not there.
2601540	2605540	But you can kind of hear yelling like ...
2605540	2606540	Like from the basement.
2606540	2610540	There's a door very clearly kind of around the corner that leads to the basement and
2610540	2612540	it's open.
2612540	2615540	Do you guys want to start going there or do you want to look around the rest of the house?
2615540	2620540	I want to do just a visual scan as I'm walking toward the basement door.
2620540	2621540	What can I see from ...
2621540	2622540	An ocular pad.
2622540	2623540	An ocular pad and of the premises.
2623540	2625540	So, there's not a lot specific up here.
2625540	2628540	All over the house, there's a bunch of random stuff.
2628540	2634540	It's on the counters, the tables, any surface is full of stuff and not clean.
2634540	2641540	There are beakers and other types of like containment objects all over the place as
2641540	2646540	well as mini jars, which is another thing that I just said.
2646540	2648540	Something you can contain things in.
2648540	2651540	Also, some bowls.
2651540	2652540	No, I'm just ...
2652540	2655540	So, lots of stuff like that around.
2655540	2658540	Just kind of like all around a mess.
2658540	2667540	There's shit everywhere and in fact, it smells terrible and it kind of smells like shit in here.
2667540	2668540	People or animals.
2668540	2669540	Which is weird.
2669540	2670540	Well, when you ...
2670540	2671540	Just general.
2671540	2672540	Both, yeah.
2672540	2683540	However, good question because when you go around, you do see a litter box, but there's
2683540	2687540	poop in it, but it doesn't look like cat poop.
2687540	2688540	Is it too big?
2688540	2689540	It's too big.
2689540	2690540	She is a fucking witch.
2690540	2693540	She's got a giant cat man named Salem.
2693540	2695540	Can we discern anything that she's yelling?
2695540	2698540	As she starts walking up the stairs.
2698540	2701540	She's like, did you kick down my door?
2701540	2703540	We thought you were in trouble, ma'am.
2703540	2705540	I am in no trouble.
2705540	2708540	Please leave my home immediately.
2708540	2713540	Ma'am, we believe you are Harvey and a legal giant cat man in this premises.
2713540	2716540	Do you hear the words coming out of your mouth, officer?
2716540	2717540	I just point to the litter box.
2717540	2722540	She looks over at it and she says, Salem is going to get some licks for that.
2722540	2723540	Can you show us Salem, ma'am?
2723540	2724540	Yeah.
2724540	2729540	And she points at a picture on one of the countertops somewhere.
2729540	2731540	It's a picture of her and her husband and their cat.
2731540	2732540	They have a black cat.
2732540	2734540	Ma'am, there was somebody else in this house.
2734540	2736540	Do you know where they went?
2736540	2737540	That was just Doug.
2737540	2738540	Who's Doug?
2738540	2739540	Doug's my husband.
2739540	2740540	She points at the same picture.
2740540	2741540	Where'd Doug go?
2741540	2743540	He's downstairs.
2743540	2745540	He does not want to be disturbed.
2745540	2749540	Well, tough titty said the kitty.
2749540	2752540	I brush past her and start walking down the stairs.
2752540	2753540	No.
2753540	2754540	I holler down the stairs.
2754540	2757540	Doug, I need you to come up here.
2757540	2759540	You hear?
2759540	2761540	Meow.
2761540	2762540	From downstairs?
2762540	2763540	Yeah.
2763540	2772540	It's a fucking cat man.
2772540	2773540	Oh my God.
2773540	2774540	All right.
2774540	2777540	Cover me.
2777540	2782540	A cold chill runs down Clark's spine as the joke that they were having suddenly becomes
2782540	2784540	very real.
2784540	2786540	This was never a joke to me, Clark.
2786540	2787540	It was to me.
2787540	2788540	Don't go down there.
2788540	2792540	And she kind of like tries to get in front of you and close the door to the steps to
2792540	2793540	the basement.
2793540	2794540	I hold the door.
2794540	2795540	She's just looking up at you.
2795540	2800540	By the way, Dr. Marie Jacobs is an older, short, plump woman.
2800540	2803540	She has mascara smeared all over her entire face.
2803540	2805540	Her hair is a complete disaster.
2805540	2809540	And she is wearing a white coverall with long neoprene gloves.
2809540	2814540	Does it look like if you smeared the mascara off her face, she might actually be a cat?
2814540	2819540	From what you know about both humans and cats, I would say no.
2819540	2821540	Okay.
2821540	2825540	As she does this, she looks at John and she says,
2825540	2828540	Actually.
2828540	2830540	And turns to Clark and says,
2830540	2832540	You can go downstairs.
2832540	2833540	And looks back at John.
2833540	2835540	Join me in the kitchen for a moment.
2835540	2837540	Sidebar, Clark?
2837540	2838540	One moment, ma'am.
2838540	2839540	Doctor.
2839540	2840540	Thank you.
2840540	2844540	I didn't go to seven years of school to be called ma'am.
2844540	2845540	Of course not, doctor.
2845540	2846540	Hey, Clark.
2846540	2848540	You're not going to let me go down there alone, right?
2848540	2849540	No, no.
2849540	2850540	We got to arrest her right now, right?
2850540	2852540	Like this is suspicious as hell.
2852540	2853540	Yeah.
2853540	2855540	She's like dissecting a cat man down there or something, right?
2855540	2856540	Yeah.
2856540	2858540	Something unholy is happening in this house.
2858540	2859540	Things are real weird.
2859540	2860540	That's against the law, right?
2860540	2862540	At the very least, the guy downstairs ain't coming up.
2862540	2864540	And after I told him to come up.
2864540	2865540	So.
2865540	2866540	Handcuff her?
2866540	2867540	Yeah.
2867540	2868540	I just started handcuffing her.
2868540	2869540	And I started reading.
2869540	2875180	Ma'am, you're under arrest for suspicion of harboring an unholy cat man for impeding the
2875180	2878860	investigation of two officers for just being creepy as hell.
2878860	2881540	Clark, you got anything to add?
2881540	2882540	No.
2882540	2883540	That was it.
2883540	2884540	All right.
2884540	2885540	Yeah.
2885540	2886540	I'm real sorry, doctor.
2886540	2888540	But you are just under all kinds of arrest.
2888540	2889540	Salem!
2890540	2897540	And you hear just this like boom, boom, boom, like coming up the stairs.
2897540	2898540	I cuff her as quickly.
2898540	2900540	I try to cuff her like very quickly.
2900540	2901540	All right.
2901540	2902540	Roll.
2902540	2904540	You can either roll law or dexterity.
2904540	2905540	Dexterity.
2905540	2906540	Okay.
2906540	2908540	58 on a 65.
2908540	2909540	Well done.
2909540	2917540	You get the cuffs locked and you are ready for whatever is about to happen next.
2919540	2920540	Thank you.
2920540	2920540
