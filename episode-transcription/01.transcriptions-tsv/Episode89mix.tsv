0	4500	Did y'all know that real human people eat mushrooms?
4500	6100	Those weird little fuckers
6100	8460	that grow out of the poop or something.
8460	11560	Damn, and y'all thought I was nasty.
11560	14700	And here you are just eating dirt fungus
14700	16840	like it's going out of style.
16840	19860	I'll take a pot of day old warm cream
19860	23340	any day over mud fucking mushrooms.
23340	25900	Speaking of fucking, y'all are listening
25900	28800	to the radio show that fucks the most.
28800	32360	694.2 PTBP.
32360	37360	And I am your most fuckingest host, Wolf the Dog.
37640	40140	I'm excited to announce a new project
40140	42840	for our citizens of contention.
42840	47000	We want to write a Delta Green scenario as a community.
47000	48800	Over the next few months,
48800	51320	we'll be having prompted writing contests
51320	54820	to find the best meaty chunks y'all can muster.
54820	59000	We'll use each round's winner to inform the next prompt
59000	61280	until we have enough juicy morsels
61280	63920	to make ourselves a narrative feast.
63920	67060	To get in on this tub of greasy love,
67060	72060	head on down to reddit.com r slash pretending to be people.
72660	76100	Show us what you've got and vote for your favorites
76100	78580	to help us choose the winners.
78580	81700	Is 89 episodes a long time?
81700	83340	Are we friends now?
83340	86420	Would a friend throw a wolf a fucking bone
86420	91260	and slap those follow buttons on Twitter and the Instagrams?
91260	93440	Would a friend take it a step further
93440	96420	and spend a minute typing up a five-star review
96420	98340	on Apple podcasts?
98340	101060	If you do, I might read it on air
101060	103160	like I'm about to read this review
103160	108160	from Hello Under Dash Cerise entitled Best Wolf Ever.
109180	110420	They right.
110420	111480	Listen, y'all.
111480	114320	This here actual play role-playing podcast
114320	118520	is really creative and might just spoil you for any others.
118520	121000	If you don't know what Delta Green is,
121000	123120	you're in for a treat.
123120	126960	Imagine X-Files meets Lovecraft meets Night Vale,
126960	130240	except the agents are pretty terrible at their jobs.
130240	134160	But actually, really, the best part is Wolf the dog
134160	136360	as the intro DJ.
136360	139160	In the very many large, numerous amounts
139160	142800	of new music tracks he plays every week.
142800	144560	Hell yeah, baby.
144560	148520	Finally, some recognition for all the damn hard work I do,
148520	152080	especially when it comes to seeking new music out.
152080	155160	I don't know what all those things you listed are,
155160	157600	but I assume that they meant that you think
157600	160940	that this weird podcast is good?
160940	162560	I wouldn't fucking know.
162560	165480	Never listened to a second of it personally.
165480	170160	This was one of 234 tasty reviews.
170160	174920	And when we hit 311 on Apple Podcasts, I'll tell you what.
174920	177800	Every person who has typed up a sweet treat of a review
177800	179920	will be entered in a drawing
179920	182840	to win a pretended to be people t-shirt.
182840	184400	That's right, folks.
184400	186320	The merch is real.
186320	189100	It's just that you have to win a drawing
189100	191680	to get your mitts on these shits.
191680	194200	Until my producer figures out how the fuck
194200	197560	the internet works, same, honestly,
197560	199400	then it'll be for sale.
199400	204400	And remember, most of those 234 reviews weren't written.
204680	206840	They just hit the fifth star,
206840	209480	which still makes Wolfie smile.
209480	213480	But you must write a review to be entered into the contest.
213480	216100	Also, that makes each of your chances
216100	219620	of winning one of these sick teas that much greater.
219620	223020	So get in on it while the getting's good.
223020	226800	Do y'all remember my dog, Wolf, the dog?
226800	229780	Today, I found him sitting at a little desk
229780	232660	with a microphone and sunglasses on.
232660	236920	It looked like he had some kind of broadcasting kit.
236920	238620	What the fuck?
238620	241860	Where the fuck did he get sunglasses from?
241860	244980	Time for the most stable part of this here reality.
244980	247220	It is the news.
247260	250820	Last time, John Lee Kevin Moore the Thirth
250820	254020	let slip to Anne Love that he is not, in fact,
254020	256580	her former partner from K-Cell,
256580	260100	but rather he is, in fact, one of the vectors
260100	262860	K-Cell was tasked with destroying.
262860	267180	Anne then put an impossibly clean blade into John's head
267180	269900	and with a chant continued to move it deeper
269900	273860	into this cranium down into his throat
273860	276700	before eventually ending his life.
276740	279380	For a sweet, sweet moment.
279380	283860	In the muddy, ankle-deep, fish-infested overflow
283860	285780	of Bean's pond.
285780	288700	Clark did what he could, but it just seems like
288700	291600	this Anne Love is one resilient fucker.
291600	294060	Round and round and round she goes.
294060	295420	Will she stop?
295420	297140	Nobody knows.
297140	298980	There's only one thing I do know
298980	302420	and that's that I put my trust in kudzu with no backbone.
306700	334700	Quick behind the GM screen here at the top of episode 89.
335700	338940	Thomas, you might find this interesting.
338940	342380	Clark, he, oh, no, your name is Joe.
342380	347380	And, fuck, we're deep in it now.
347700	352700	We're so deep in it, my notes here for the last episode say
354140	357940	if Anne finds out that John is ball
357940	361100	she will make an excuse to walk away
361100	362900	to chant over her blade,
362900	365220	make them roll alertness to hear that
365220	366960	before attacking John.
369620	371500	Yeah, see, we're totally railroaded.
375860	378180	I think something in my mind was just like,
378180	380740	you know what, he's probably just gonna fucking tell her.
383220	385580	And then instead of having to make an excuse to go away
385580	387740	you guys are like, hey, can we have a minute?
388500	390100	Yeah.
390100	392220	Will you walk away and chant over your blade real fast?
392260	393100	We gotta talk.
396780	398660	Take all the time you need.
401900	404300	That was a really good Anne Love impression.
404300	407260	I gotta admit, both Clark and Joe were surprised
407260	410260	that Kevin did tell her about ball.
410260	411800	That popped out of nowhere.
412860	414580	Well, yeah, it did.
414580	416460	That's because I completely forgot
416460	421300	that we weren't telling her who I was.
421380	424260	That you were John, right, right, right.
424260	426300	Too many secrets and lies, man.
428620	432020	Oh, actually that's what, season two, no secrets, no lies.
434100	437260	No repercussions, no secrets, no lies.
440820	442460	We'll still fuck it up, don't worry.
442460	443300	Yeah.
445980	448020	I mean, if you guys were just truthful with everyone
448020	450300	right off the bat, you wouldn't have to keep track
450300	451860	of all your lies.
451860	454500	It's more or less what I was attempting there.
457580	458860	Radical honesty.
461740	464000	I gotta get this off my chest.
466000	468660	Well, she sure knew a lot about ball.
469700	472840	You know that thing, me and my, you and my dad
472840	476840	were sent to contention to take care of, I'm one of them.
477840	480840	Let's see, the note in the green box said they got
480840	484320	nine of 12, so I guess that's 10 of 12 now.
484320	486240	What the fuck, what the fuck?
486240	488740	I don't remember the note, I got a final note.
488740	491280	That was like episode five or six, I mean.
494280	498480	Holy shit, yeah, it was like over a year and a half ago.
498480	502880	And that's just in release time, not when we actually played.
502880	506240	It's funny, here, this is a page from back
506600	509120	when we first started of what my notes looked like.
509120	513040	Very detailed, so detailed, so many words on the page.
513040	518040	This was last session, and that was the entire session
520100	525100	was this bottom quarter of a page and then two sentences
525400	526640	at the top of the next.
529400	533760	That's fair, as you've lost sanity, you've also lost
533760	538040	all motivation to keep track of the events of this game.
538040	541760	Here was a good day, at some point I just wrote
541760	544600	like four notes on a page and then went to the next page
544600	545680	for the next session.
549040	554040	Here's me getting theomania, belief you are a god.
555480	557480	Yep, is that the last note you took?
557480	559240	Oh, nope, oh my god.
561240	563720	Oh yes, that is righteous.
564560	565960	That was my god phase.
565960	567560	Then it's back to normal notes.
569160	573240	My notes for last episode have a ton of stuff.
573240	577880	We didn't do any of it, except for that one,
577880	580760	the chant over her blade before attacking Jon.
580760	585640	I found what we'd written down, what I wrote down
585640	589520	for what was found in the storage lockers.
589520	594280	And I wrote like bricks of cocaine, a burlap sack,
594280	597480	lots of cash, and then it just says lots of great shit.
599040	604040	And then it skips down, it says three notes on a table.
604080	606040	I don't describe those notes.
606040	608280	Three notes on a table?
608280	611320	If you would ask me if there were three notes on a table
611320	613760	in that fucking green box, I'd be like, no,
613760	616320	there weren't just three notes sitting on a table
616320	617640	that we didn't like.
617640	618920	Do you want me to tell you what they were?
619640	621000	I wrote three notes on a table,
621000	625160	including newspaper clipping about Cole's orphanage,
625160	627160	which has recently been brought up,
627160	628760	which is kind of cool that I just read that.
628760	630000	Well, it keeps getting, yeah, I mean,
630000	632200	they did a shitty job of erasing it from history
632200	635400	because everybody's fucking talking about it.
635400	640200	Let's see, one is a note that says the cabin
640200	643720	is in the woods, stark west from the end of the trail,
643720	647920	about 2.5 miles, signed K.
647960	649880	Okay, so we investigated that.
649880	653560	But then it also says, we took care of nine of them
653560	656080	as well as the leader.
656080	658720	That's the one I didn't remember just now.
658720	660360	I remember it phrased like that,
660360	662400	didn't think they were talking about ball babies.
662400	664400	Yeah, there's another one that says
664400	666840	the work is difficult in particular,
666840	669360	but I've had 12 successes.
669360	672680	Life isn't as complex as they believe.
672680	674980	They are quite simple.
674980	677680	It will be their downfall.
677680	681140	And then finally, the newspaper ad from 25 years ago
681140	685720	for Kohl's Orphanage, new school under modern etiquette.
685720	688400	Which we did end up asking somebody about
688400	690080	and they did tell us about it a little bit.
690080	693800	We've talked about Kohl's a number of times with people.
693800	695440	Kohl's Orphanage is the orphanage
695440	698160	that John Lee Pettymore came from.
698160	700960	It also was, I believe you asked Drew
700960	702440	to look up information on it
702440	704960	and he couldn't find any information.
704960	705800	Right.
705800	710640	However, Randy Angst, the first time you talked to him,
710640	713600	had a distinct memory of an orphanage
713600	715480	existing under that name.
715480	717000	And then did we learn,
717000	719140	we learned more about it in the woods arc, right?
719140	720920	Certainly out of character.
720920	725680	That was a big part of the Ken Krenkelhoff story.
725680	726960	Yup, yup, yup.
726960	727800	Yup, yup.
727800	730820	Ken might be chilling in a door somewhere, even to this day.
732720	735600	I believe that door, along with the rest
736280	737120	of the cabin was set on fire.
737120	738160	Oh, that's right.
738160	739600	Yup, nevermind. Poor door boy.
739600	740440	Poor door boy.
744880	747200	Krenkelhoff door boy.
747200	749200	Well, do you guys want to get into this?
749200	750080	Yeah, let's hit it.
750080	752640	John Lee Pettymore the first body is like,
752640	754520	oh, okay, that seems about right.
754520	755360	Sorry.
758400	760260	I think Thomas might be calling me.
760260	762440	I'm on Do Not Disturb right now.
762440	763560	So I'll have to look at my phone
763560	765000	to see if he's actually calling me.
765480	767120	No, he's calling Luke.
767120	768740	For sure he's calling Luke.
768740	770640	Luke didn't pick up because he's too busy playing.
770640	773440	Do you have your phone set on Do Not Disturb?
773440	774540	Oh no, I don't.
776520	777460	It should be ringable.
777460	778880	No, it's ringing.
778880	779720	Hello?
779720	781760	Hey, follow me.
781760	782680	Off mic.
783960	786720	Oh, they're just walking away from their microphones.
786720	788800	They could just turn off their microphones,
788800	791080	but they've decided to take their headphones off
791080	793880	and walk away from their cameras.
793920	795760	Oh, I can hear them actually.
795760	798560	Oh, I can absolutely hear what they're talking about.
798560	801220	Thomas is so fucking loud, it's crazy.
801220	802760	He just asked Joe.
802760	805800	He just told Joe that he has 15 luck
805800	809560	and that he can spend 10 to have a vision.
809560	811680	And he asked Joe what would be the most
812800	814620	prudent information to learn.
815660	816800	Go lie down right there now.
816800	817840	Now they're back.
817920	818760	Oh.
820600	824200	I was narrating the phone call for our listeners
824200	827240	because you left your microphones on.
830520	831980	And Thomas is really loud,
831980	834280	so I could hear his side of the conversation.
835360	838040	Oh yeah, look, it's really plain and audacity.
843520	846240	Shit, it's like, yeah, it's totally all there.
847840	852480	Fuck, all right.
852480	854480	Well, now I'm actually gonna leave the room for a second
854480	856440	so you guys can just talk to each other on mic
856440	858400	if you wanna do that. Nice try.
860800	863200	He made a big show of pulling out his earphones,
863200	865120	but we know he's been on speaker this whole time.
865120	868040	The earphones aren't what's plugged in, it's his earbuds.
869000	872520	Those are just decoy earphones.
872520	875000	Did you guys have a good conversation?
875000	875960	Yeah.
875960	877480	Yeah, yeah.
877480	878520	Wouldn't you like to know?
878520	881040	Why don't you just check the track and find out?
881040	883880	We should have said like, fuck you, Zach, or some shit.
885080	886480	That would actually be really funny.
886480	889360	I like listening to the conversations you guys have
889360	890240	when I've left,
890240	891920	because typically in the middle of the episode,
891920	894600	you forget that I'm gonna listen back to him.
894600	896360	So when you guys just keep talking about
896360	900120	how much you love me and appreciate that I'm doing this,
900120	902040	it's like, joke's on you.
902040	903840	We're just trying to get you
903840	905280	to treat our characters well.
908040	908880	We know you're listening.
908880	909720	Well, speaking of which.
909720	911160	We're just trying to earn a favor.
912240	914040	John Lee Pettymore, the thirst body
914040	917080	is in a fucking waterbed grave,
917080	920760	and Clark is standing behind it,
920760	924280	and you can see the hilt of this blade
924280	928240	sticking up out of the water above the head.
928240	930720	And right ahead of that is Anne Love,
930720	935400	whose wry smile is just sitting
935400	940120	as it always seems to be underneath a single eye.
941080	943680	You've seen the other eye in action
943680	945960	when her hair gets tousled about.
945960	948120	Like, she has two eyes.
948120	950200	We're not worried about that, but.
952520	953800	I wasn't until now.
954720	955760	Yeah, why do you?
958480	959600	You're being really suspicious.
959600	962440	We're not worried about that.
962440	965320	About how many eyes this person has.
966240	968760	She's a cyclops.
968760	970960	Is it more or less than two?
972800	976160	Ooh, there's the question for anyone with bangs, honestly.
976160	981160	Spider Anne has as many eyes as a spider does.
985720	987280	It literally would have rhymed.
990520	992880	How many eyes do spiders have?
992880	994240	Luke, look that up.
994280	995200	All right, so.
999040	1000520	He's having his own fun.
1001400	1002800	Yeah, but I miss him.
1002800	1003840	Oh, me too.
1003840	1005480	I mean, I get to spend time with him,
1005480	1010480	but I still miss him and his terrible, terrible internet.
1011520	1012880	Are you dating him?
1012880	1014000	Are you dating Luke?
1014000	1015480	Are you dating Luke, dude?
1015480	1017080	Don't tell my ex-girlfriend.
1017080	1017920	Are you dating?
1019200	1020960	That's not our joke.
1020960	1023640	Oh, fuck, I always forget that that's like
1023640	1028040	the stapled, good joke, Scott Ockerman.
1028040	1028880	All right, so.
1028880	1030000	Okay, nice deflection.
1030000	1032040	But for real, dude, are you dating Luke?
1034280	1037400	We're not supposed to tell anyone about it.
1037400	1040280	I fucking knew that something like this
1040280	1041920	would tear the podcast apart.
1044080	1046120	You get the five of us together
1046120	1048240	and eventually somebody's not gonna be able
1048240	1050000	to keep it in their pants.
1050000	1052920	And I'm surprised, I'm surprised at you, Zach.
1053440	1054760	Luke, I expected.
1057000	1059480	Joe, sure, Justin, of course, but you?
1059480	1061720	Taylor said she'll only let me keep doing it
1061720	1063680	if she takes Luke's spot
1063680	1066000	and plays Keith Vigna the rest of the time.
1066000	1066840	Okay, cool.
1066840	1067760	I don't know, a chick?
1070160	1071260	You don't know any?
1073400	1076280	I'd like to spend 10 luck to have a vision.
1076280	1077320	Oh, okay, cool.
1080040	1082320	What, that's crazy.
1082560	1085160	Thomas, you can spend 10 luck to get a vision?
1085160	1086000	That's nuts.
1086000	1086840	Fuck yeah, dude.
1086840	1088360	How much luck do you have?
1088360	1092360	Well, I have 15 because I spent 10 of my 25
1092360	1094560	to avoid major damage.
1094560	1095400	Hell yeah.
1095400	1098200	And I'm still hanging on with one hit point here.
1098200	1103200	You see one weak finger rise up from the pavement
1104640	1106480	from a shattered body.
1106480	1107640	It's all he can muster,
1107640	1109520	but you see life in John Lee Pettymore
1109960	1112880	as he urges you to wait a minute as he has this vision.
1118320	1120440	Okay, yeah, that seems perfect.
1120440	1122320	Joe, take off your headphones, I suppose,
1122320	1123800	unless you already know what the question
1123800	1124800	he's gonna ask is.
1124800	1127640	I don't 100%, I'll play it like that.
1128640	1130000	Take them off.
1130000	1131920	Yeah, yeah.
1131920	1133000	All right, Thomas.
1133000	1134560	Where's the book?
1134560	1136880	Your entire face is underwater
1136920	1139920	and typically your eyes would roll back
1139920	1142360	into your head during one of these,
1142360	1147360	but as you lift a finger and begin finding yourself in ball,
1149560	1152280	you seem to have the ability to reach out
1152280	1156440	into the collective unconsciousness of the entire universe
1156440	1160560	to pick out certain memories that exist
1160560	1163880	from people throughout different times.
1163880	1168880	And you see Gary Daley ushering Eunice and Jerry Bishop
1170840	1173680	into the back of the Daley Fuh,
1173680	1178680	and you see him passing this book to the bishops.
1178760	1183360	The book is covered in uncured leather
1183360	1187080	with some hairs, maybe some acne.
1188800	1193800	There's some stretch marks on the binding of this book
1193800	1196680	and he hands it to him and then reality begins
1196680	1200920	to kind of fade up and blink and turn
1200920	1204040	like you're turning channels on a television.
1204040	1208560	And then you're inside the bishop home.
1208560	1210240	And you see Eunice and Jerry,
1210240	1213240	they're talking about this book that they have
1213240	1216320	just sitting on their kitchen table
1216320	1219560	and they're sitting on either side
1219560	1222360	discussing options, seemingly.
1222360	1226880	And a young Clark Bishop walks into the room
1227960	1232200	and quickly, Jerry gets up and is like, oh, no, no, no,
1232200	1234120	and sits him in front of the TV
1234120	1236200	where Wheel of Fortune is on.
1237760	1241720	Memories kind of fade, reality blinks out again,
1241720	1246080	and you see Eunice and Jerry at the television.
1246080	1248520	It's in this entertainment center.
1248520	1251560	They move the television out of the way
1251600	1256080	and there's a false bottom of this entertainment center
1256080	1261080	and there's a safe with an alphabetical keypad entry.
1262000	1264760	And you're just watching them open it up.
1264760	1266160	What code did they punch in?
1266160	1267720	I'm not gonna give you the code.
1267720	1270040	You asked where the book is, not how to get it.
1270040	1271960	I'll fight you for it.
1271960	1273200	All right, come over here.
1275520	1277000	I could use some human touch.
1278160	1280720	That's not Luke's, I mean my wife's.
1281040	1282040	You're Luke's.
1286280	1289240	And you see them punching a code,
1289240	1291560	but the camera is just on their faces
1291560	1292840	as they're typing it in.
1292840	1293800	Oh, great.
1293800	1296440	Listen, Zach, I've seen enough below deck
1296440	1298800	to know how this is gonna go with Luke.
1298800	1303400	So you just need to end it now to keep things professional.
1303400	1307000	Otherwise we're gonna tear this whole organization apart
1307000	1309240	with sex and recriminations.
1309280	1312760	This thing was doomed the second you put two feisty,
1312760	1316680	hot 20 somethings in it like me and Luke, baby.
1316680	1317520	Yeah.
1318400	1320120	You know when we started,
1320120	1324240	Joe, Justin and I were hot 20 somethings as well.
1325280	1327000	Of course this was years ago.
1329480	1331480	In the before times.
1332720	1335080	And they placed the book in this safe
1335080	1338200	in the false bottom of this entertainment center
1338200	1341360	and they close the door and click lock
1341360	1345280	and you see them look at each other and they embrace.
1345280	1349080	And then you're back under this muddy, murky water
1349080	1351080	right outside of Bean's Pond.
1351080	1354160	And the year is whatever year it is.
1354160	1355000	2000.
1360320	1361400	I'm gonna bring Joe back.
1361400	1362320	Hi, I'm back.
1362320	1364200	Hey, Joe.
1364200	1365360	Hello.
1365400	1369320	Clark and Anne are just staring at each other
1369320	1372040	waiting for John to be done with his vision.
1374280	1376720	John is still weakly holding up his finger
1376720	1379400	and he starts to writhe in the water and
1381800	1383560	Don't you touch him, man, don't you touch him.
1383560	1386320	And Anne is looking down at him with massive eyes,
1386320	1387720	just so confused.
1387720	1389440	And he rolls over on his side.
1392000	1392960	John, John.
1396200	1400320	I know where your book is, Anne.
1402320	1403880	That's a nice try.
1403880	1405600	That's a nice try.
1405600	1408080	Okay, I guess we'll persuade.
1408080	1408920	10.
1410160	1411000	How?
1411000	1413200	Well, I'm something of a savior
1413200	1417920	and I have the second sight as part of that whole package.
1417920	1419400	He's not lying about that, Anne.
1419400	1421400	I've seen him see things before.
1421400	1423880	I can see into moments into the past
1423960	1427680	or rather moments into the not now.
1427680	1432680	And well, I saw a whole little saga of the book,
1433360	1434200	but
1434200	1435040	Tell me now.
1435040	1438960	Well, it is at Clark's parents' house,
1438960	1440720	but you'll never find it without me.
1440720	1441800	What do you want?
1441800	1444520	Well, when we find the book,
1444520	1446360	I want you to teach us the spell
1446360	1447960	to help us get through that door.
1447960	1450120	Okay, neither one of you are gonna be armed
1450120	1452640	and I'm gonna walk behind you with two guns.
1452640	1454000	No. One on each of you.
1454000	1455480	No, no, no, no, no.
1455480	1456880	Other way around maybe.
1456880	1458560	Well, why would I trust you?
1460240	1463120	After all this, you think I'm gonna trust you?
1463120	1465400	You're the one who's trading the book for your life
1465400	1466760	essentially right now.
1466760	1471120	I'm the one with a gun pointed at your head.
1471120	1472480	I reload my gun.
1472480	1474160	Just so you know, in this mud,
1474160	1476000	you've kind of turned over.
1476000	1477640	You're on your back now.
1477640	1482480	You've got a massive knife going all the way down
1482480	1484760	through your skull, touching your uvula,
1484760	1488080	and she has a gun pointed at you.
1489080	1490880	And you reach for your gun?
1490880	1492240	Yes.
1492240	1493080	Good call.
1496160	1497920	Okay, no guns.
1497920	1498960	We all leave them here.
1498960	1501080	Wow, what if we just all had guns?
1501080	1504280	This is gonna end in a bloodbath if you don't...
1504280	1505120	Can we not?
1505120	1507600	This town is full of fanatics and freaks,
1507600	1509320	and you know, you've got your magic,
1509320	1511400	but I'd rather have my gun.
1511400	1513120	You know, a lot of people are trying to find us.
1513120	1514680	I mean, you do have a knife.
1517240	1519040	We're not joking about that yet.
1520240	1521800	Okay.
1521800	1524680	It's cool that you can talk normally though.
1524680	1526880	All right, so everyone has their guns
1526880	1528920	and we'll just all be good
1528920	1531840	because we both need each other to get this done,
1531840	1533680	hopefully by the end of the episode.
1535160	1537000	Can you get your knife out of my head?
1537000	1539400	I don't know if that's a great idea.
1539400	1541800	For bleeding's sake,
1541800	1545000	I mean, I'd rather have my knife back, you know,
1545000	1548400	but it doesn't seem like you'll survive
1548400	1550720	and I now need you, unfortunately.
1550720	1552320	You're magic, but something tells me
1552320	1554200	you probably don't know any healing.
1554200	1555080	Oh, that's a good point.
1555080	1556080	No, I could do that.
1558360	1560440	Could you throw a little bit of that my way
1560440	1562240	and then you could maybe have your knife back?
1562240	1563200	It's really hard.
1563200	1564720	This is a very big knife
1564720	1566760	and it's hard to hold my head up with it.
1570000	1572680	She kind of crouches down on the ground.
1572680	1575600	There's just enough of the knife sticking out.
1575600	1578480	There's just enough of the blade sticking out at the top
1578480	1580880	to where she can wiggle her fingers in
1580880	1585160	and she begins cutting right in between two of her fingers,
1585160	1587840	just enough to get blood to start coming out.
1588800	1590800	And then she starts chanting,
1590800	1595920	Dem artai rat, dem artai rat, dem artai rat.
1595920	1596760	On the last one,
1596760	1601760	she pulls the knife all the way up out of your head.
1603040	1607320	And with a chant, the blood that comes out of her hand
1607320	1611480	forms like a jackhammer tube of coagulation
1611480	1613800	straight down into your throat
1613800	1616160	and you can taste Anne loves blood.
1620600	1622320	Both of you roll sanity.
1622320	1623160	Oh no.
1623160	1625320	Oh ho ho ho ho.
1625320	1626640	Fail, 48.
1628480	1631000	Fail, 78 on an eight.
1631000	1633240	What's your power there?
1633240	1634080	My power?
1634080	1635920	Oh, fuck me, dude.
1641200	1642280	It's a 60.
1642280	1643840	So I rolled over my power.
1645400	1646760	We were all gonna be...
1646760	1648440	This may work in our advantage.
1650640	1653080	Yeah, show her Clark's a wild card.
1653080	1657560	Fucking maybe, but this episode was gonna be fine.
1657560	1658640	It was about to happen.
1658640	1659960	It was about to happen.
1661800	1664480	Okay, you're both gonna lose a D4.
1664480	1665320	Oh, for real?
1665320	1666440	For blood magic.
1666440	1667280	One.
1667280	1671360	That puts a column of blood through the entire head.
1671360	1672360	I'm at 15.
1672360	1673200	Two.
1674800	1677440	I lose two and that puts me at my breaking point.
1679360	1680240	All right.
1680240	1681560	That means you break, right?
1681560	1683520	That means it's time for a new mania.
1684920	1686040	What a time for it.
1686040	1687640	What a time for it.
1687640	1689440	What a time to be a fan of this podcast.
1689440	1692360	Ha ha ha ha ha.
1692360	1694280	Listeners, I'm glad you're here with us right now.
1694280	1695800	This is...
1695800	1697280	We were so close.
1698160	1699880	Everything was gonna be all right.
1699880	1700880	What the...
1708880	1712280	So, it's time to roll, baby.
1712280	1713720	Oh, fuck me.
1713720	1715120	It's still time to roll, baby.
1718400	1720040	Oh boy.
1720040	1725040	Sample mania's table from Call of Cthulhu, 7th edition.
1725080	1727760	D100, three times.
1727760	1728840	94?
1728840	1732040	94 is theomania.
1732040	1732920	God damn it.
1732920	1735200	The belief that he or she is a god.
1736520	1737600	Hey, you get a second chance.
1737600	1739280	So, we meet again.
1739280	1740600	Ha ha ha ha ha.
1741920	1743240	A 62?
1743240	1748200	62 is gonna be legiro mania,
1748200	1753200	an uncontrollable compulsion to make loud or shrill noises.
1754160	1755680	No, thank you.
1755680	1756520	We don't need to roll.
1756520	1757360	I'll take that one.
1757360	1759200	Ha ha ha ha ha.
1759200	1760640	Fuck you.
1760640	1762640	And the last one.
1762640	1764480	51.
1764480	1767360	51 is gonna be gymnomania.
1769520	1771960	Is that nudity?
1771960	1773520	Yes, it is indeed.
1773520	1776640	It is a compulsion with nudity.
1776640	1778560	Oh boy.
1778560	1780840	Oh, I didn't wanna take the belief in God thing
1780840	1783520	because I was so fucking bad at it before,
1783520	1786440	but I also don't wanna be taking my clothes off all the time.
1786520	1788320	Ha ha ha ha ha.
1788320	1791600	Joe, what an opportunity you've been given
1792720	1794640	here at this stage.
1794640	1795480	Yeah.
1795480	1797240	I mean, yeah, no, 100%.
1797240	1800040	I know that right now would be a really good time
1800040	1801480	for Clark to think that he's a god
1801480	1805240	because we are in overseer territory.
1805240	1808720	I just worry that it's hard for me to play it sometimes
1809840	1812400	because how does a god decide,
1812400	1814600	how does a god go somewhere else
1814600	1816080	when people wanna go somewhere else?
1816600	1817680	You know what I mean?
1817680	1819000	It's hard sometimes.
1819840	1821480	I'll try it, I'll try it.
1824240	1826600	That's all that anyone's asking.
1827960	1830040	No one listens to this fucking show anyway.
1830040	1833200	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
1833200	1834320	Yeah, I'm gonna do it.
1834320	1837760	I once again believe that I am a god.
1837760	1838720	Yes, you do.
1838720	1841360	How hard do you believe it?
1841360	1843600	Also, remember that each one of these manias,
1843600	1847560	it strips away Clark Bishop's being.
1847560	1851200	Clark is no longer who he was when he started.
1851200	1855200	He's been taken over, especially with this one.
1855200	1858800	So much of Clark's self was dictated
1858800	1862120	by his almost nonchalance.
1863720	1868560	However, I mean, you got that big overseer dick energy, dude.
1868560	1870760	Spread it around, slap it on the table.
1870800	1873840	Bring it out betwixt the robes opening.
1877840	1879480	Yeah, I got it, you got it.
1879480	1881360	But also that would be a compulsion of nudity,
1881360	1882200	so whatever.
1886440	1888280	I pick both, I pick both, I pick both.
1888320	1890560	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
1898960	1900960	Hey, how much did Anne Love fail me for?
1900960	1902520	Oh, let me roll.
1902520	1904160	Oh, you get a D6.
1904160	1905240	Five.
1905240	1906840	Fuck yeah.
1906840	1908200	So I'm at six.
1908200	1910040	So the thing that sent me over the edge
1910040	1914160	was seeing her cut her finger with the blade in his head.
1914160	1917320	So I'm gonna lash out at her and try and,
1917320	1920160	I want to wrestle the knife away from her.
1920160	1922720	And I'm yelling, what the fuck is that?
1922720	1925840	Fucking knife, blood magic, fucking shit.
1925840	1927120	Like rushing her now.
1927120	1929880	Okie dokie, that'll be unarmed combat.
1933480	1936360	I pass a 41 on a 70.
1937320	1938760	She passed with a 36.
1938760	1939840	Yes.
1939840	1944280	She pulls the large knife up out of John Lee Pettymore's
1944280	1947040	head as she finishes this incantation.
1947040	1949760	And before she knows it, you're just on her.
1949760	1952360	And you grab the knife out of her hand,
1952360	1953760	screaming about blood magic.
1953760	1955720	And she just jumps back and she's like,
1955720	1958320	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
1958320	1959680	It's literally healing.
1959680	1960720	It's my blood.
1960720	1962240	It's healing him.
1962240	1963880	What the fuck is your problem?
1963880	1965360	It's not, it's not, it's not right.
1965360	1966760	That's not, that's not something a person
1966760	1967800	should be able to do.
1968840	1969680	Too fucking bad.
1969680	1972200	Clark, I will say that personally at this moment,
1972200	1973840	I have no objections.
1973840	1974960	Are you, are you, are you you?
1974960	1975800	Are you all right?
1975800	1976640	Are you you?
1977160	1979360	It was her blood that went inside of you.
1979360	1980600	Yeah, I know.
1980600	1984320	She gave me a well, a well, a much needed transfusion.
1985640	1986480	I feel better.
1986480	1987440	I feel better, Clark.
1990640	1993360	I don't, I don't, I don't like, I don't like any of this.
1993360	1995800	This is, this is, this is,
1996960	1998040	this isn't the way it's supposed to be.
1998040	1999600	This isn't the way it's supposed to happen.
1999600	2000560	Clark, man.
2000560	2003280	None of this is the way it was supposed to happen.
2003280	2005640	No, I'm pretty sure this is exactly
2005680	2007000	the way it was supposed to happen.
2007000	2011120	Now we talked about guns, but I really,
2011120	2012840	I would appreciate the knife back,
2012840	2015880	but you seem to have a whole look in your eyes
2017920	2018760	right now.
2018760	2023360	So just by the time we get to your parents' house,
2023360	2024840	can we call it that still?
2024840	2026760	Then I would like to have that knife back
2026760	2028280	if that's possible.
2028280	2031200	I'll think about it, but I'm holding onto it for now.
2031200	2032560	That was, that was freaky.
2032560	2033520	That was freaky shit.
2033520	2034520	Does Clark have a gun?
2034520	2035640	I don't technically.
2035640	2036480	Can I fish another water?
2036480	2037320	Oh, you dropped it?
2037320	2038160	Yeah.
2038160	2040120	Yeah, and as you pick it up out of the water,
2040120	2042520	it's water-locked, so you're just kinda like.
2042520	2045520	All right, and Clark's gonna hold onto the knife
2045520	2048280	and you're gonna drop your gun here in the pond with ours.
2048280	2050280	Oh, so we are going no guns?
2050280	2052000	I thought we were going all guns.
2052000	2055920	I've, your mouth is kinda like a gun.
2055920	2056760	What?
2056760	2058920	She says spells and stuff to make people get hurt.
2058920	2059760	All right.
2059760	2061440	She's kinda got a built-in gun.
2061440	2063960	Well, it helped too.
2064280	2066200	I need pills.
2066200	2069280	I need, I need strong pills.
2069280	2071640	Do you have any of those at your house, Clark?
2071640	2074360	I mean, there's a chance I got something there,
2074360	2077440	but I could just top you up right now, right here.
2077440	2078920	Here, just come here, just come here.
2078920	2079760	What?
2079760	2081400	What?
2081400	2084280	He crawls, he crawls a little bit towards you.
2084280	2088040	I put my hand on his head on the wound
2088040	2089920	and I try to heal him.
2089920	2092160	Clark tries to heal him.
2092160	2093480	Okay.
2093840	2096240	John Lee Pettymore starts praying.
2096240	2097080	Yeah.
2099160	2100880	It's like, no, I get it, I get it.
2100880	2103200	Through crest, all things are possible.
2103200	2105480	Is there a roll that I could make to-
2105480	2107000	Go ahead and roll unnatural.
2114440	2116080	I passed.
2116080	2118960	It's a 31 on a 49.
2118960	2122480	Whoa, I forgot we had good unnatural scores.
2123480	2126680	This game is broken wide open.
2128560	2129400	Joe?
2129400	2130240	Yeah.
2130240	2134640	Some words pop into your mind
2134640	2139120	and you know that if you can spill some blood
2139120	2142840	and say these words, that you can make it happen.
2142840	2144840	I've got the knife in my hand still.
2144840	2148600	So I take a page out of the book that I just saw
2148600	2151240	and love demonstrate for me.
2151320	2154240	And I do a little cut on the side of my thumb.
2154240	2156200	So it's kind of dripping a little bit.
2156200	2160240	And I say, damn all to year it.
2160240	2162040	Damn all to year it.
2162040	2163920	Damn all to year it.
2163920	2165800	And as you finish saying the last one,
2165800	2169720	the blood just like flows out of your thumb
2171440	2174320	and goes up into the nostrils
2174320	2177480	and the mouth of John Lee Pettymore.
2177480	2182160	And you see the ooze pouring from his eyes
2182160	2184320	and his ears and his mouth
2184320	2187280	and the blood flowing on top of the ooze
2187280	2189520	into all of his orifices.
2189520	2191600	Go ahead and roll a D six.
2195560	2196400	It's a one.
2199800	2202960	Joe, every little bit helps.
2202960	2205400	And I just want to say you started this
2205440	2208240	by losing your goddamn mind over and love
2208240	2210440	cutting yourself on that knife to heal me.
2210440	2213960	And you ended it by fucking getting the courage
2213960	2214840	to do that yourself.
2214840	2216440	So I'm really proud of you, man.
2219520	2224520	Joe Clark and just Clark needs to roll sanity on this one
2225160	2230160	due to your change of pace and mindset
2230880	2235880	and your shocking ability to be able to do this yourself.
2236440	2237800	That's a fail.
2237800	2239440	And that's going to be another D four.
2239440	2240280	Fuck me, dude.
2240280	2241440	It's a 79.
2241440	2242640	It's over my power.
2246760	2249560	Fuck, and I rolled a four.
2249560	2251120	Fuck me, dude.
2252720	2254800	How much do you have left?
2254800	2256480	I got two, baby.
2256480	2257600	Oh my God.
2260240	2261080	Oh, okay.
2261080	2263640	Upon seeing that it fucking worked,
2265400	2268240	Clark's mind like starts to fracture
2268240	2272280	and he pulls the knife away and yells, it worked.
2272280	2277280	It's what I was always meant to be.
2278080	2279720	It's what I was always meant to be.
2279720	2281120	We don't need you anymore, Anne.
2281120	2282680	We don't need you anymore.
2282680	2284600	And I go right after her with the knife.
2284600	2285440	Yes!
2290160	2291000	Yes!
2296040	2296880	Hey, Joe.
2296880	2297720	Yeah.
2297720	2298800	How much luck do you have?
2298800	2299640	A lot.
2299640	2301120	Do you need to know an exact number?
2301120	2305640	No, I don't, but this just seems like a good opportunity
2305640	2309280	if you wanted to literally spend all of your luck points
2309280	2312120	to determine the outcome of this fight.
2313560	2317160	You can also just spend luck points to change a roll.
2317160	2318320	You could also do that.
2318360	2320760	Don't let him, don't let him.
2320760	2322680	This is, you're talking to the devil right now.
2322680	2324520	And he's like, hey, Joe, give me all your luck.
2324520	2325600	You don't have to do that.
2325600	2326440	I'm just saying.
2326440	2327280	There's a lot of things you can do
2327280	2328280	in this fight with that luck.
2328280	2330440	Instead of having to roll against me,
2330440	2333200	who crits constantly during combat,
2335200	2337480	you could just spend all of your luck
2337480	2340520	and decide exactly how you finish off
2340520	2342600	and love in this moment.
2342600	2344640	You do only have two sanity, so.
2345640	2346480	Yeah.
2346720	2347760	Yeah.
2347760	2350120	And I do want to, I do kind of want to finish her off.
2350120	2350960	Yeah.
2350960	2351880	You know where the book is.
2351880	2353880	You told us you know where the book is, right?
2353880	2355320	Yeah, I'm going to try and finish her off.
2355320	2360320	I'm going to spend my hefty bank of 65 luck.
2361920	2363320	Holy shit.
2363320	2366720	And I'm going to call this like it is,
2366720	2369280	Clark rushes her with unnatural strength.
2370720	2372080	Oh yes, he does.
2372080	2375320	In a flash is on her and he just wants to shove,
2375880	2378880	he wants to do to her what she did to John.
2378880	2381400	He wants to bring the knife down through her head.
2383080	2384600	And that's exactly what happens.
2384600	2388040	Clark rushes her with eyes akimbo,
2388040	2391080	knowing what he has always been
2391080	2393800	and was always meant to be
2393800	2398600	and jumps up in the air with a dagger in both hands
2398600	2401600	and comes down on top of Anne Love's head,
2401600	2406600	whose eyes are so wide because she's never seen anyone
2407000	2412000	pick up any sort of unnatural ability A at all,
2412080	2417080	B that quickly or C without any sort of training whatsoever.
2418480	2422680	And you come down and pierce the top of her skull.
2422680	2427040	And as you shove the knife into the top of her head,
2427040	2430880	you see one of her eyes directly starts looking
2430880	2435000	into your eyes and the other one just fills completely
2435000	2440000	with blood and the blood begins pouring down her face.
2440600	2445600	She stops breathing and you stand back
2446040	2451040	and she wobbles forward, backward, forward.
2451120	2453880	And the knife still in her skull,
2453880	2458880	she just falls back into the overfilled beans pond.
2461880	2466600	And begins floating out into the middle
2466600	2468400	of the mushroom shaped pond.
2470720	2473760	Holy shit, Clark, that was awesome.
2473760	2475880	We should go and get that book.
2475880	2478680	Yeah, you haven't changed furniture, have you?
2481240	2484080	As a matter of fact, no, why do you ask?
2484080	2488520	Woo, okay, it'll make more sense when we get there.
2488560	2491660	I'm not gonna tell you in case you decide to and love me.
2498200	2499160	Yeah, let's go.
2499160	2501760	As Clark Bishop and John Lee Pettymore the third
2501760	2505920	trudge north through the town of contention,
2505920	2508760	heading up through the warehouse district,
2508760	2511960	pass subtropolous and all of downtown
2511960	2514400	on the west side of A plus storage
2514400	2519400	where you found the storage units G10, G11, and G12
2519640	2523320	filled with, what was the quote, cool stuff.
2523320	2524160	Lots of cool shit.
2524160	2525000	Awesome things.
2525000	2526320	Lots of cool shit.
2526320	2527640	Lots of cool shit.
2529100	2531360	Past Julie Maxwell's apartment building.
2531360	2534240	I've got a really, really dumb story.
2534240	2536400	There was a local trucking company
2536400	2540760	that had this like billboard on I-44
2540760	2543920	and it had like a picture of an electric guitar
2544400	2548840	and like a motorcycle and like a baseball bat
2548840	2552440	and in really big letters, it said cool stuff.
2552440	2556520	And in really small letters, it said trucks bring it.
2556520	2559840	But it was really hard to see the trucks bring it part.
2559840	2563600	So it just looked like a dope billboard for cool stuff.
2563600	2564880	I remember that billboard.
2564880	2566040	I totally remember it.
2570240	2572080	That's like an intimidating thing
2572120	2575360	for like a sports team called the trucks.
2575360	2577040	Trucks bring it.
2577040	2579040	Trucks bring it.
2579040	2581120	Oh, the trucks is such a good name
2581120	2582960	for an American sports team.
2582960	2584200	The trucks would be so good.
2584200	2585760	Holy shit.
2585760	2588920	Oh my God, your mascot could be like a dude
2588920	2591240	inside a blow up semi.
2591240	2593800	It could literally just be a dude fucking
2593800	2598800	like tearing up your field in a tricked out like F-150.
2599560	2604560	They could bring out like a fake field to put on top.
2604880	2606520	That's how fields work, right?
2606520	2607960	Yeah, for sure, fake field.
2607960	2610360	When it rains, they pull out the fake field
2610360	2612640	at baseball games.
2612640	2616160	I was 17 years old and I was playing Ultimate Frisbee
2616160	2618180	at the park that's across the street
2618180	2621080	from our double A stadium here in Springfield
2621080	2623620	where the Springfield Cardinals play.
2623620	2628620	And it was raining and a few of us thought
2628920	2631740	to ourselves, there's a game tonight, isn't there?
2631740	2634320	So the tarps probably on the field.
2634320	2637560	And so we ran and we jumped the fence
2637560	2641720	and we ran down the third base side
2641720	2644520	and we hopped onto the field.
2644520	2648280	And I slip and slid from third base
2648280	2651200	over the mound towards first.
2653120	2657360	And then took off running and security yards chased me
2657360	2662360	for like a block, but I was more agile back when I was 17.
2665320	2668600	And it's still one of my greatest memories.
2668600	2670400	It's honestly very cool.
2671800	2673720	Yeah, Zach, that's a lot cooler
2673720	2675640	than my story about a billboard.
2680640	2683320	But also I saw that billboard and I was like,
2683320	2684480	oh, that's so cool.
2688280	2692960	And as you pass Julie Maxwell's apartment,
2692960	2696160	you look up and see a billboard that has an electric guitar
2697720	2698960	and a baseball bat.
2700680	2701720	And what else was it?
2702600	2707400	It was like a convertible and like a basketball.
2707400	2709440	I remember the basketball and the electric guitar.
2709440	2711680	I could see both of those pictured perfectly.
2712680	2714800	And for some reason, all this billboard says is
2714800	2716080	trucks bring it.
2717360	2722360	Well, yeah, we haven't talked about the local
2723040	2727040	rookie league baseball team outside of town, the trucks.
2727040	2729240	The trucks, the contention trucks.
2732800	2735320	John weakly says, trucks bring it.
2738480	2740000	He's got season tickets.
2741480	2743520	And as you're trudging through contention,
2743520	2747880	you hear screams coming from the East
2747880	2751880	and you can echo locate well enough here in contention
2751880	2755280	to know that these screams are coming from
2755280	2758680	the first church of contention as you're heading North
2758680	2761560	up towards Clark Bishop's home.
2761560	2763600	Does it sound like a lot of screams?
2763600	2768200	It sounds like a lot of screens, tens of screens.
2768200	2771840	Is it loud enough that we would stop in our tracks for it?
2772520	2774200	It's not something we're just catching a whiff of
2774200	2775240	on the air.
2775240	2779960	Off in the distance about when you hit A plus storage,
2779960	2782480	you start hearing it and it's just.
2790120	2791760	Just shit like that.
2791760	2793400	I don't want you to go there.
2793400	2796360	I just want us to feel bad about not going there.
2796360	2797320	Just enough.
2797320	2798160	Yeah.
2798160	2800840	John, I think if we stay the course,
2800840	2803320	the whole point of our mission here is that overseer
2803320	2808280	will come back and I'll save everyone.
2808280	2810360	I don't think there's anything that's going to help us
2810360	2811440	by helping them now.
2811440	2815480	If they just are released into a world full of this goo,
2815480	2817520	we need, we need me and myself.
2817520	2818360	Yeah.
2818360	2820840	I mean, I'm still pretty knife brained buddy.
2820840	2824680	So I'm in no position to run off
2824680	2827480	and save a bunch of people at this church.
2827480	2829320	I think we need all the help we can get.
2829320	2830160	All right.
2830680	2832440	And those pills, did you say you had pills?
2832440	2834000	You didn't have pills.
2834000	2835240	What was the deal with that?
2835240	2838600	I gave you, I gave you, I gave you health.
2838600	2839600	I healed you.
2839600	2840880	The one, okay.
2842560	2845480	If I took an aspirin or something.
2845480	2847480	I genuinely forgot it was just for one.
2848920	2849760	No, I healed you.
2849760	2850600	I healed you.
2850600	2851440	I healed you.
2851440	2852840	Good job, buddy.
2852840	2854160	Thank you.
2854160	2856440	Let's go, let's go, let's go get that book.
2856440	2857640	Let's go get that book.
2858640	2860360	Yeah, we just keep going.
2860360	2861800	Clark, your home.
2861800	2862640	How's it look?
2862640	2863480	Well, as you're approaching,
2863480	2865320	you do notice that the creek
2865320	2870320	that runs kind of behind your house, dry, completely dry.
2870440	2872600	But the home itself looks the exact same
2872600	2874880	as you left it yesterday.
2875960	2878560	Yeah, I opened the door.
2878560	2883560	That familiar smell just wafts right up through your nose.
2883880	2886360	And it's almost unseemly
2886360	2891320	because you're not the man you were who lived here.
2891320	2894360	John, welcome to my parents' house.
2894360	2899360	I guess it's mine, but is this what you need?
2900000	2901480	Is this where the book could be?
2901480	2902880	Yeah, I think so.
2902880	2906160	No drugs is what we decided.
2906160	2907320	There's no drugs here.
2907320	2908760	Joe, go ahead and roll luck.
2909760	2910600	Fuck you.
2914480	2919480	That's my favorite joke that I've done on this podcast.
2924920	2926720	That one's just for the GM.
2930880	2933480	Some of them gotta be.
2933480	2937120	Clark, not even like wine or anything?
2938920	2939760	Definitely not.
2939760	2943000	There might be a beer or two in the fridge.
2943320	2946400	Please bring me two, one, two drink
2946400	2948960	and one, two press to my head.
2948960	2951600	I do, I go to the fridge and grab a couple beers.
2951600	2956200	Okay, you need to move the TV.
2956200	2958800	Just take it off the stand.
2958800	2961040	Oh, okay.
2961040	2962120	And I go and do that.
2962120	2966120	I just, I guess, pluck it up and put it down on the ground.
2966120	2968200	Is that it, John?
2968200	2970120	You don't see a door?
2970120	2971880	Nope, the TV's on the ground now.
2971920	2972760	What do we do?
2972760	2974640	God damn it, ow.
2975880	2979720	Okay, I don't know, really try poking around in there.
2979720	2982480	Is it just a flat top where this TV's staying?
2982480	2984600	I just kinda start smacking on it.
2984600	2986200	When you start smacking on it,
2986200	2988880	it kinda like wobbles a little bit.
2988880	2992320	Two corners stay put and the other two corners kinda wobble.
2992320	2994800	Oh, I got something here, it's moving.
2994800	2998080	And you can remove the entire flat wood piece
2998080	2999880	from underneath the television.
2999880	3000700	I do so.
3000700	3004540	And underneath, there's the door of a safe
3004540	3008820	that has an alphanumerical keypad.
3008820	3012020	I think maybe the Wheel of Fortune letters
3012020	3013980	or maybe your name or some other bullshit
3013980	3015620	that meant something to your parents, I don't know.
3015620	3019980	Clark is gonna remember that his mother always told him
3021060	3024460	that I was born with the best letters.
3026100	3027940	Clark always remembers.
3030700	3031540	Yeah.
3035660	3037140	It's only three in the morning.
3037140	3039180	It's shocking you can't remember this.
3039180	3044180	Yeah, he's gonna put in R-S-T-L-N-E.
3046140	3048380	And the door unlocks.
3048380	3049220	Yeah.
3050500	3054900	And when it opens, you see a book inside
3054900	3058060	that is made out of uncured leather
3058060	3060540	and it's got like hair on it.
3061260	3062660	Some pimples, maybe a rash.
3062660	3065020	There's stretch marks on the spine.
3065020	3066300	I found my book, Jon.
3066300	3067860	I grab it and hold it up.
3069420	3070900	And as soon as you grab it.
3070900	3073060	Yeah, I was worried about that.
3075020	3076620	All right, you guys can stop recording.
3076620	3080080	Oh, you son of a bitch.
3081300	3083700	Do I really stop recording right there?
3083700	3084540	No.
3084540	3085540	Oh shit, okay.
3085540	3088780	Your eyes go blank and suddenly you're standing
3088780	3091700	in the abandoned water park, Splashylvania.
3091700	3093900	You're looking up at the two-fanged plunge.
3093900	3095740	Julie Maxwell fires a bullet
3095740	3098420	that tears through the body of Leo Piston.
3098420	3101780	You raise your firearm and immediately put lead
3101780	3104740	in the crazed Julie Maxwell's forehead.
3104740	3108820	The two bodies begin slumping down the twin slides,
3108820	3111180	leaving a trail of blood behind.
3111180	3112060	You blink.
3112060	3115500	You're standing in the suburbs in the middle of the street
3115500	3117380	in front of Dr. Marie Jacobs' house.
3117380	3120700	You see James the mill worker floating off the ground,
3120700	3124180	Aiden and Alice Little are bravely holding a vacuum
3124180	3126160	to this hovering man's feet.
3126160	3130620	But from out of the vacuum bag erupts an oily black ooze
3130620	3134180	that immediately encompasses the twin children.
3134180	3137900	And you can see them fighting violently
3137900	3140820	inside the muck that envelops them.
3140820	3142900	When you look over at Jon,
3142900	3146580	you see the same viscous sludge is dripping
3146620	3148940	from every hole in his face.
3148940	3149860	You blink.
3149860	3152300	You're staring at a gaunt young boy.
3152300	3154220	The two of you are hanging in a cage
3154220	3157100	above a deprived and debaucherous crowd.
3157100	3159780	The cage is shocking you, burning your skin
3159780	3164660	as the ceiling of this juice box lowers slowly.
3164660	3166660	You don't wanna do it.
3166660	3168220	You don't wanna push him back in,
3168220	3171780	but either one of you dies or you both die.
3171780	3175220	You push the boy's body back into the plexiglass room
3175220	3178220	just in time for the roof to come down,
3178220	3182500	squeezing the boy pulp onto the ravenous audience below.
3182500	3183820	You blink.
3183820	3186660	You're all over the CSU campus.
3186660	3188740	This one's a rapid fire montage,
3188740	3190540	murder after murder after murder,
3190540	3192300	finishing off with your own,
3192300	3196060	your own yourself ending screwdriver plunge.
3196060	3197240	You blink.
3197240	3199900	You're standing outside of Bean's pond,
3199900	3202300	an ankle deep muddy overflow,
3202300	3204500	and you know what you are capable of.
3204500	3207940	You know what you are and you scream
3207940	3211060	as you jump and bury the knife in your hands
3211060	3214020	down through the skull of Anne Love,
3214020	3216580	the woman who murdered your parents.
3216580	3218020	You blink.
3218020	3223020	You're back standing in your parents' living room.
3223380	3227700	You look down and your hands are covered in blood
3227700	3230180	and the blood begins moving,
3230180	3233940	collecting between the covers of this book
3234220	3236300	made from human skin,
3236300	3239540	and the blood begins forming pages,
3239540	3244100	each page a result of your actions.
3244100	3245860	Roll Sanity.
3245860	3248500	It's going to be a one slash one D six plus one.
3250300	3251580	Don't pass.
3251580	3252760	31 on a two.
3256400	3257340	Roll a D six.
3259300	3260920	Real quick, Joe,
3260920	3263580	did you hear how Zach just like rattled off
3264100	3265540	all the Bishop murders?
3265540	3268120	Total like basic true crime bitch.
3271180	3272020	I forgot I forgot.
3272020	3274620	I forgot to tell Thomas to take his headphones off.
3276080	3276920	Yeah, it was like,
3276920	3278380	it seems like I shouldn't be hearing this,
3278380	3279860	but I'm glad I did.
3281700	3284140	It was a trip down memory lane.
3284140	3285060	I rolled a one.
3285060	3288260	I swear it's a oneer.
3288260	3291780	So I cling, isn't there like a thing though?
3291780	3293020	Isn't it if you were at one,
3293500	3294340	it's still not good.
3294340	3296300	Well, no, it's just that the San loss for that
3296300	3297780	was a D six plus one.
3300620	3301460	Okay.
3301460	3304260	Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
3304260	3305840	Yeah, so Clark is a,
3305840	3307220	Clark is,
3307220	3310060	he's not there.
3310060	3311240	His sanity is gone.
3311240	3314020	One of the pages flits open
3314020	3316540	and these pages that have been created
3316540	3321540	by the blood rushing from your hands form letters.
3322100	3325820	And you see these two words just repeated
3325820	3328140	over and over and over.
3328140	3332900	And in the middle is this picture of this hooded figure
3332900	3337580	with this light that is just beaming from its face.
3337580	3339300	However, in this one,
3339300	3343580	you can very clearly see your own face,
3343580	3346720	the face of a young Clark Bishop,
3346720	3350940	and you feel compelled to begin chanting,
3350940	3354540	knuckles almond, knuckles almond, knuckles almond,
3354540	3356740	knuckles almond, knuckles almond.
3356740	3360020	John Lee Pettymore, you see a flash of light
3360020	3362340	and Clark Bishop is no longer standing
3362340	3364300	in front of his entertainment center
3364300	3367300	in his living room of his parents' home.
3367300	3368700	Holy shit.
3377700	3378540	Hey Thomas.
3378540	3379540	Hey Zach.
3379540	3381260	What does John Lee Pettymore want to do?
3381260	3382340	What does he see?
3383740	3384880	Clark is just gone?
3384880	3385720	Yep.
3385720	3386680	Is the book gone too?
3386680	3387520	Yep.
3387520	3388520	Does the TV turn on?
3388520	3389360	Yep.
3389360	3392220	John presses play on the VCR,
3392220	3394540	lies down on the couch,
3394540	3398480	and lets himself watch Wheel of Fortune for 20 minutes.
3398480	3403480	Clark, you're standing in a dark alleyway.
3411040	3412600	Yeah, yeah.
3412600	3414840	And walking toward you.
3414840	3416720	Is it Jim Cook?
3416720	3418340	It's Jim Cook.
3418340	3420060	Do I have any agency over this?
3421840	3423080	Do you want agency?
3423080	3425300	I mean, I know what happens.
3425300	3426580	Clark remembers.
3426580	3429460	And immediately, in the shadows,
3429460	3431260	you just pounce on him,
3431260	3433420	throw him to the ground.
3433420	3437340	And with both of your hands wrapped around his neck,
3437340	3439940	he begins struggling.
3439940	3441240	They didn't have to die.
3441240	3442820	They didn't have to die.
3442820	3443820	You couldn't find it.
3443820	3444940	They didn't have to die.
3444940	3449940	In your grasp, in the grip of both of your hands,
3450220	3453940	wrapped around Jim Cook's throat,
3453940	3456160	you feel his life extinguish.
3457420	3458260	Holy shit.
3460260	3461100	Oh no.
3464300	3465140	Oh my God.
3486580	3491580	What's up, what's up everybody?
3495140	3497380	It's Zach, I'm Zach.
3497380	3499180	I'm just gonna slide in here real quick
3499180	3502940	at the end of this episode to drop some pretty big news.
3502940	3507940	So Taylor and I are moving to South Korea on Thursday.
3508480	3511420	It's been our dream for years to teach English in Korea.
3511420	3513600	We're so absolutely stoked.
3513600	3517720	This long time plan is finally coming to fruition.
3517720	3520640	I know, I know you're super excited for us
3520640	3523880	and not at all wondering what is happening with the show.
3523880	3526660	Well, that's just super supportive of you.
3526660	3528740	Thank you so much.
3528740	3532240	But if you are wondering, I have some answers for you.
3532240	3536320	So first off, we've already recorded the next full arc
3536320	3537320	of season one,
3537320	3541120	and we've started recording the final arc that follows.
3541120	3544240	This campaign has enveloped my life
3544240	3547160	like a squamous viscous ooze,
3547160	3550560	and I'm not going to compromise its quality
3550560	3553560	just because I'm moving halfway around the world.
3553560	3556080	We've had a fair amount of practice recording over Zoom
3556080	3557980	at this point, so I'm not worried about anything
3557980	3561280	except that I'll have to wake up early to record now.
3561280	3566080	All MPC voices will soon become much deeper.
3566080	3568900	Next week, we'll be releasing a bonus episode
3568900	3572420	from our Patreon vault to try to coax some of you
3572420	3576220	into giving us money during a full-blown economic crisis
3576220	3578640	because we're fucking ruthless.
3578640	3582820	And the Friday after that, on August 14th,
3582820	3585940	the penultimate arc of season one
3585940	3588860	of pretending to be people begins.
3588860	3592740	I'm so gosh darn jazzed for y'all to hear it,
3592740	3596040	and I'm so pumped to play through the end of this campaign.
3596040	3597680	Ha!
3597680	3599480	Last thing, fear not.
3599480	3602240	The end of season one will not be the end
3602240	3603960	of pretending to be people.
3603960	3608960	I have delicious, insidious plans for the future.
3609620	3613280	Seriously, thank you all so much for listening.
3613280	3616180	We have such a blast making this show,
3616180	3618680	and we're so stoked y'all enjoy it.
