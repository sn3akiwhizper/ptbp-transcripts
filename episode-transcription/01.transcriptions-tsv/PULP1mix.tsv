0	3120	Well, here we are once again, folks.
3120	4800	For the first time.
4800	7960	Again, it's your favorite radio DJ
7960	12080	from inner and outer space, Wolf the Dog.
12080	15580	And where and when the fuck am I?
15580	17120	Hold on.
17120	20800	It smells like East Coast.
20800	23700	Let me check my local dimension time.
23700	28180	It's 1937 and New Year's Eve.
28220	33020	It's as if I have no control over what happens to me.
33020	37520	Like someone is forcing me to play into the sick fantasy
37520	40460	that's broadcast to all the world.
40460	45060	But yeah, I guess we got a new Howlin' with Wolf or whatever.
45060	47280	If these are even real.
47280	50860	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Jeff in Seattle,
50860	54180	who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending part.
54180	58040	A simple and worthwhile use of any person's time.
58040	60280	Jeff in Seattle writes,
60280	63940	a shout out to my wonderful and adorable little brother,
63940	65640	Chalky Boberson.
65640	70360	May your D100s roll low and your D20s roll high.
70360	73180	And a warning to Matias Black.
73180	76680	Temporal manipulation never ends well.
76680	79940	Don't gaze into dimensions that are not your own
79940	82920	unless you want eyes looking back.
82920	86920	Well, Jeff in Seattle, I have to say that temporal
86920	90480	whatever you said seems pretty cool to me.
90480	93840	Sometimes you gotta gaze into another dimension
93840	95280	as a little treat.
95280	99260	And sometimes you have to consume another dimension
99260	101580	as a big ol' meal.
101580	104740	If you wanna write up something for your Wolfie to how,
104740	107280	tag at pretending part on the internet
107280	111760	or write up a five star review on Apple podcasts.
111760	114020	If you holler and let us know,
114020	117160	you're sure to get the message that's deep in your soul
117160	120220	to come out of this dirty old mouth hole.
120220	123740	And if you're interested in doling out some dough
123740	125800	to keep this show afloat,
125800	130800	head on over to patreon.com slash pretending pod
130860	134740	for 29 bonus episodes.
134740	138540	From Call of Cthulhu's classic scenario, The Haunting,
138540	141700	to silly one page RPG sessions
141700	144500	from our first season session zero
144500	148920	to a currently 13 episode long mostly homebrew
148920	153540	Delta Green campaign called The Creature Crew.
153540	158540	All the links are in the show notes.
158740	162080	Sound the alarm, but don't hit the snooze.
162080	166980	Like a beast mode stiff arm, I'm quaking for the news.
166980	169520	The first season of pretending to be people
169520	171620	was a well-loved affair.
172500	175980	So much so that it reached one million downloads.
175980	178580	Thank you to everyone who contributed
178580	183460	to this chunky number being so unbelievably large.
183460	186420	Also, this episode right here kicks off
186420	191420	the five episode guest run featuring Scott Dorward
191420	194880	running a pulp Cthulhu scenario he wrote,
194880	198520	which is called A New Age of Wonders.
198520	201180	And call me Mrs. Liam Neeson
201700	206700	if I am mistaken, but a new story deserves a new theme song
206860	209840	and A New Age of Wonders deserves something
209840	211980	full of pain and sorrow.
211980	215300	It's Isabelle Crane with Hollow.
217060	222060	I didn't know a body could be hollow
223860	227980	before its blood ran cold.
228820	233820	I didn't know that the wind could sew
235820	240820	through tissue and faggot bones.
243220	248220	You were hollow when you spoke to me.
250820	255820	Hollow when you said you were hollow.
257980	262980	I thought you might be starving,
266780	271780	so I gave you everything.
275180	277660	Oh, actually I'm peaking a bit.
277660	278980	Let me just drop my gain.
278980	282260	Drop your gain to the floor, drop your gain to the floor.
282260	286260	If your name is Scott Dorward, drop your gain to the floor.
286260	287100	Nice.
287300	289020	I've never had a hype man before.
291900	293060	How'd you feel?
293060	294140	I feel warm inside.
294140	295140	I feel special.
300140	302820	Welcome everyone to Pretending to Be People.
302820	305420	We are here with a special guest today
305420	310420	who is not only one of the good friends of Jackson Elias,
310440	314380	not only the man at the helm of multiple games
314380	315500	throughout the internet,
315500	318340	but currently including running
318340	321540	the Pulp Cthulhu campaign two-headed serpent
321540	324060	for the podcast How We Roll,
324060	327500	and just the all around incredible writer,
327500	331540	tabletop master, wizard extraordinaire on the internet.
331540	332380	Man with the golden voice.
332380	335140	And the guy who I kind of wish was my grandpa,
335140	336740	but haven't told him that to his face,
336740	338020	it's Scott Dorward!
341460	342500	Thank you very much.
342500	344140	I'm never going to live up to that now.
344740	345580	You know that.
347420	349100	Well, Scott, you've already lived up to it
349100	351060	because we had you on a while ago.
351060	352260	Was it last year?
352260	354100	Oh, maybe even longer than that.
354100	355100	It was over a year ago at this point.
355100	355940	Wow.
355940	356780	Was it really?
356780	357900	It was at the end of 2020, I think.
357900	359100	Oh my God.
359100	361980	And you ran Bleak Prospect for us,
361980	363980	which is a Call of Cthulhu scenario
363980	367740	that was written by a very talented writer
367740	369660	for Call of Cthulhu.
369660	370500	Who was that?
370500	371340	Who was that?
371340	372180	Oh, I forget.
374180	375580	They're all the same, really.
375580	379500	Well, you silly goose, it was written by you.
379500	380340	Okay.
380340	381500	I don't know why I've been so weird.
385500	386340	Are you okay, man?
386340	387980	It was, you wrote it.
390540	391780	I wrote it a long time ago.
391780	393100	I can't remember doing that.
393100	395540	It might as well have been someone else.
395540	397940	I've written so many things over the years.
398540	403540	And honestly, it was one of my favorite
404020	406300	role-playing experiences of my life.
406300	408020	It's still some of the stuff I go back
408020	411020	and listen to repeatedly just to hear it all again.
411020	412940	I'll keep that in mind when I'm getting excited
412940	414980	about the numbers, that it's just Joe.
414980	415820	Yeah.
417100	418140	So if you're listening to this
418140	419380	and you haven't listened to that,
419380	422260	Scott does an incredible job running Bleak Prospect
422260	423620	for the four of us.
423620	426460	And that was actually, that was a really wild time
426500	431500	because Scott is in Europe and we are in North America,
432100	434820	but at the time I was in Asia,
434820	437460	so we were recording across three continents.
437460	438300	Yeah.
438300	439980	Yeah, that was like five minutes a day
439980	441940	when we were all in sync, wasn't it?
441940	443700	It really was.
443700	448060	It took a long time to get on the same schedule.
448060	450060	We really are a global podcast.
450060	453780	Yeah, well, we're the international role-playing podcast.
453780	455660	That's what everyone knows that.
455700	460420	The Springfield, Missouri podcast is the international.
460420	463180	We have a pretty big blip on the map of listeners
463180	464340	in like South America.
464340	467300	So recording in Asia, North America and Europe,
467300	469900	having people in South America listen to it.
469900	471700	We just got to get some of those researchers.
471700	473580	Exactly, we got to get hit Antarctica.
476580	479140	But today we're not playing Call of Cthulhu
479140	481540	and today we are not playing Delta Green.
481540	485100	And today we are playing.
485100	486460	D&D first edition.
489460	490300	Firewall.
490300	492420	That was fun when Dungeons and Daddies did it.
492420	493260	Oh, that was tight.
493260	496500	But we're not doing that and we probably never will.
496500	497740	Sorry, I haven't been talking much.
497740	498860	I've just been trying to pretend
498860	501460	like I wasn't working on my character sheet.
503900	505380	Which is a different character sheet
505380	507620	than we are used to using.
507620	509740	I believe it's the first time
509740	512540	that I personally have filled out a PC character sheet
512540	514100	for Pulp Cthulhu.
515500	516500	Pulp Cthulhu.
516500	518060	Pulp Cthulhu.
518060	521180	I've done a couple, mostly with you, Zach.
521180	522780	You ran us through some back in the day.
522780	525100	I've run it, I've never gotten to play it.
525100	527060	I'm super fucking excited.
527060	529100	I was able to run Waiting for the Hurricane
529100	530900	from the back of the book,
530900	533380	which was written by another good friend
533380	535340	of Jackson Elias, Matt Sanderson.
535340	536180	Yes.
536180	537000	Is that right?
537000	537840	He did.
537840	541900	And of course we are wishing a speedy recovery to Matt.
541900	542740	Yeah, thanks.
542740	544500	It's been a scary month with Matt,
544500	548180	but happily he's back home and on the road to recovery now.
548180	549900	That's fantastic news, yeah.
549900	552040	How's your, the last time we recorded
552040	553820	you had like a tooth issue.
553820	554940	Oh fuck, yeah.
554940	557320	I ended up in hospital with that.
557320	558160	Yeah.
558160	558980	Oh my God.
558980	561860	Yeah, I ended up having to have emergency surgery
561860	563820	in part of my jaw removed.
563820	564980	Oh man.
564980	565820	Yikes.
565820	567620	Yeah, I can't say I recommend it.
567620	568460	No.
569460	571660	Has it been a relatively smooth sailing
572300	573500	after the surgery and stuff though?
573500	576620	Yeah, I mean, the shape of my mouth still feels wrong,
576620	578940	but apart from that, yes.
578940	579760	Yeah.
579760	580820	Oh, interesting.
580820	582980	Did they let you keep the part that they pulled?
582980	586340	I stupidly didn't think to ask because otherwise, yeah,
586340	589260	I absolutely would have kept it in a jar at my desk.
592140	594020	Scott, let's dive in.
594020	594860	Let's do it.
594860	595700	Okay.
595700	599260	So this scenario is called A New Age of Wonders
599260	603660	and it's published in issue three of the Blasphemous Tome,
603660	606820	which is the fanzine that we do for the Patreon backers
606820	608500	of the Good Friends of Jackson Elias.
608500	612180	Which you should all become because I personally
612180	615020	am a patron of the Good Friends of Jackson Elias
615020	620020	and the rewards that I reap are worth every fucking penny.
620340	621180	Well, thank you, Zach.
621180	623820	Yeah, I'll slip the check in the mail.
627180	628200	Eight bucks.
629940	631540	Every eight dollars counts.
632660	637660	Oh God, eight dollars is big money in the RPG field.
640940	644660	So this scenario takes place in 1937,
644660	648100	particularly New Year's Eve, 1937.
648100	650300	The player characters have all been invited,
650300	652340	or at least they have managed to get themselves
652340	654820	on the invitation list too,
654820	659140	what promises to be the New Year's Eve party of the year.
659140	663140	Or at least that's the way that the host has pitched it.
663140	666900	The host is a man called Cicero Mordant.
666900	669780	He comes from a moneyed background
669780	672940	and his family is incredibly wealthy,
672940	675740	but he himself has gone off
675740	677180	in a somewhat different direction.
677180	681380	He is an inventor, or at least a would be inventor.
681380	684380	I mean, those of you who've kept up with his career
684420	687580	know that he's enthusiastic,
687580	692580	he's good at self-promotion, perhaps,
692820	694340	and he certainly has the money
694340	697540	to bring his inventions to the market.
697540	700540	But really, fundamentally, he's a bit shit.
701420	703020	I mean, some of the inventions
703020	704300	that he's put out over the years
704300	707220	are things like this self-playing violin,
707220	711100	which promises to bring chamber music to every household,
711100	713100	but it really just plays the same four bars
713260	714420	over and over again,
714420	716940	and goes out of tune in about five minutes.
717980	719500	There was the electric hairnet,
719500	724220	which promised to revolutionize home hairstyling.
724220	727500	And there've been a number of unfortunate fires
727500	731060	and the lawsuits are still in the courts at the moment.
731060	733980	The less said of his radiant dentifries, the better.
736420	738540	But this time he promises
738540	741780	that he has got a magnificent new invention
741780	744300	that he wants to show off to the world.
744300	746540	And the launch of this invention
746540	749460	is going to be this New Year's party
749460	753500	at his family estate, The Mount, in rural Vermont.
753500	756900	So let's, I'd say, introduce the player characters
756900	761460	at this stage, and then we can just, I think,
761460	764180	get you on the road to The Mount.
764180	766940	So do you want to go round one by one
766940	768620	to say who you're playing,
768660	773660	and I think also why you're going to the party?
773780	777980	My character, oh, give me that voice, baby, is Checkers.
779780	781660	How old is Checkers?
781660	784820	I'm a 19-year-old cult leader.
786580	788980	I'm here, I'm going to the party
788980	792140	to recruit some movie stars
792140	797140	and high profile people for my cult, The Last Branch.
797820	802820	And I'm Elden Ring, and fuck's sake.
806380	808580	It's not my birth name.
808580	812220	Elden Ring is my given name by myself.
812220	814300	My given name for my family
814300	817860	is none of my business, nor anyone else's.
817860	821660	And I'm just very happy to be accompanying
821660	826660	my dear Checkers to this wonderful New Year's Eve party
826820	831100	and just helping him bring people to The Last Branch.
831100	835500	Our goal is to get as many of the rich and powerful
835500	839020	on our side today through the powers of persuasion
839020	842300	and Checkers' deep and utter charisma.
842300	844980	There are things at work in this world,
844980	847220	forces beyond our control,
847220	851820	and we look to control those forces.
851820	855740	With money that we make from the cult.
856100	858820	And Checkers, remember, the forces.
858820	860820	Yeah, they are real.
860820	862020	They certainly are.
862020	863860	Are there really any stronger forces
863860	865060	in the world than money?
867620	868700	True love.
869900	870740	Aww.
873740	876700	That is a question that the Lafayette J. Honeycutt
876700	877740	would like to get to know.
877740	880340	Are there any more forces in the universe
880340	882540	more powerful than love or money?
882540	884180	And he studies that in depth.
884180	885100	He's a scientist.
885140	886940	Does he sound like that when he studies it?
886940	887780	He doesn't.
887780	889340	You'll hear his voice when he speaks.
889340	890460	God damn it, Thomas.
890460	892060	You're such a tease.
892060	892900	Yep.
894060	896620	He's gonna be showing up to this party in disguise.
897540	898540	Why? Dressed as a turtle?
898540	900420	Because he is a professional,
900420	903220	yeah, he's gonna be dressed as a turtle.
903220	906980	No, he's a professional rival of Cicero Mordent,
906980	909220	and he wants to get a look at this invention,
909220	912540	but he was not invited because he's on Mordent's shit list.
912540	915300	Mordent has a very, very long shit list.
917300	919780	And I'm playing Harvey Brewer.
919780	922180	I'm here to make sure nobody gets too close
922180	925380	to Mr. Lafayette J. Honeycutt here.
925380	926380	He hired me.
926380	927300	I'm gonna protect him.
927300	929700	I told you, Harvey, tonight, it's,
929700	933580	it's, oh shit, what was the cover name?
938780	940180	You were gonna go with Harvey Brewer,
940180	942780	but that's my name, so we can't use that one.
942780	943620	That's correct.
943620	946500	Is this your fumbling your disguise role in real life?
949060	949900	More or less.
952100	953380	What is your actual name?
953380	954620	Lafayette J. Honeycutt.
954620	958100	But tonight you are Honeyfette J. Lafayette.
961540	962380	James Dean.
962380	966980	No one famous has been named James Dean in 1937.
968340	969940	I was gonna try to go for a mid-Atlantic,
970620	971460	and I think I'm gonna go too much
971460	974060	into copying your accent, Scott.
976780	978060	Oh, can you please try?
979140	980580	No, I'm not gonna.
980580	982180	Do it.
982180	984180	Do it, Scott, at Scott.
985820	987620	Maybe after a couple sessions.
988780	989780	Sessions.
989780	991060	Session IPA.
992900	997060	Oh, could we go puff some all this?
997060	998100	After this episode.
999100	1001020	We gotta get the first episode down.
1002620	1004900	So, like I say, you have all managed
1004900	1007340	to somehow get hold of invitations
1007340	1009180	to this New Year's Eve party,
1009180	1013100	and you know that there has been transportation played on.
1013100	1014660	All you have to do is get yourself
1014660	1017860	to Montpellier in Vermont.
1017860	1018700	There is a station there.
1018700	1020060	Scott, sorry to interrupt.
1020060	1021060	I'm so sorry.
1021060	1021900	It's Montpelier.
1021900	1023300	It's Montpelier, yeah.
1023300	1025900	Montpelier, sorry, I went for the French pronunciation.
1025900	1029180	We said it with such, like, a plum,
1029180	1031860	and when I learned how to pronounce it,
1031860	1036100	it was in Missouri, and we said Montpelier, Vermont.
1036100	1038300	Well, that is how they say it.
1038300	1039700	Montpelier, Montpelier.
1039700	1040540	Montpelier, yeah.
1040540	1043300	Montpelier, I shall say that again, then.
1043300	1046340	Montpelier, Montpelier, right.
1046340	1048740	It sounds like wrong when you say it.
1048740	1051900	I bet Honeycutt does say Montpelier.
1051900	1055180	Montpelier, Montpelier.
1055180	1058860	I've got a beautiful 1932 bottle of Montpelier.
1058860	1063060	Oh, God.
1063060	1065780	Right, so yes, you know all you have to do
1065780	1069220	is get yourself to Montpelier in rural Vermont,
1069220	1072180	and then there will be transportation at the station
1072180	1074540	that is laid on for you.
1074540	1078900	And sure enough, when the train pulls in at the station,
1078900	1082660	you can see that there are any number
1082700	1084940	of well-dressed people
1084940	1087980	who are obviously dressed up for this party.
1087980	1092980	Men in full evening dress with heavy overcoats on,
1093300	1096700	women in gowns, again, with furs over them
1096700	1100140	to keep themselves warm, because it is cold.
1100140	1102700	It's been snowing fairly heavily.
1102700	1105060	There's storm clouds up in the sky,
1105060	1108980	and you can see that the snow is falling already.
1108980	1112300	But you can also see that outside the station,
1112820	1116860	there are a number of vehicles lined up
1116860	1120500	with uniformed chauffeurs who are there,
1120500	1122100	a few of them holding up signs
1122100	1125980	announcing that they're to take people to the mount.
1125980	1129820	And after the usual moment's hesitation,
1129820	1133540	people start flocking towards those vehicles.
1134660	1138900	Shall we say, I mean, if you're happy with this,
1138900	1141540	shall we say that the group of the four of you
1141580	1144020	end up sharing the same car together?
1144020	1147700	Because, you know, each car happily seats
1147700	1149940	four passengers in the back.
1149940	1151700	And there are enough people,
1151700	1154740	guests who have arrived to the party,
1154740	1157820	that they're pretty much filling up all the cars.
1157820	1159740	One of the chauffeurs ushers the four of you
1159740	1162340	into the back of one of these
1162340	1165420	really quite fancy-looking limousines.
1165420	1169860	Gentlemen, you are going to the mount, right?
1169860	1173860	Yes, is this the correct way to go?
1173860	1175460	Yes, yes, yes.
1175460	1178580	Mr. Mordant has arranged for transportation
1178580	1180460	for all his guests, please, please.
1180460	1182380	How are you guys dressed?
1182380	1185060	Harvey Brewer is a giant hulk of a man.
1185060	1188300	He's like 6'8 and like 300 pounds, but it's like muscle.
1188300	1190580	He's a big, strong, strong dude.
1190580	1192300	And so he's wearing a tuxedo,
1192300	1195220	but it's a little tight in all the right places.
1196360	1197940	It's a little bit stretched almost,
1197940	1200660	but he's pulling it off pretty okay.
1200660	1202500	I imagine the suspension on the car
1202500	1204380	just creaks as you get in.
1204380	1205820	Yeah, exactly.
1205820	1209380	Checkers is wearing like a cashmere three-piece suit.
1209380	1211500	He's got like a full beard.
1211500	1213580	Definitely trying to look older than he is,
1213580	1215880	but he's dressed very fancifully.
1217460	1221980	And Elden Ring is just wearing a very simple
1221980	1226080	black pair of trousers and a white cotton shirt
1226080	1229640	that is buttoned down, buttoned all the way to the top.
1229640	1232160	And it has like a granddad collar,
1232160	1234400	like an old school non-collar.
1234400	1239400	Is that all you're wearing even in New Year's Eve in Vermont?
1239520	1244520	Yes, and if anyone, if like the coach driver or whatever,
1244680	1248400	like asks if I'm cold or need a fur or whatever, you know,
1248400	1250720	he just kind of says like,
1250720	1252400	no, the warmth is within me.
1253400	1254240	Nice.
1254240	1258080	I guess we'll find out how long that's going to last.
1259920	1264040	So Lafayette is wearing a tuxedo
1264040	1267540	that is as tailored as Harvey's is not.
1268880	1270800	He, I mean, he looks fantastic.
1270800	1274240	He looks like a 30s or 40s movie star
1274240	1278080	and he's got this perfect like pencil thin mustache
1278080	1281660	and a really dashing long tail coat, not a tail coat,
1281660	1286020	but a long coat, it's winter in Vermont
1286020	1288860	as Scott just tipped us off to.
1292340	1294860	Quickly improvise a coat,
1294860	1296660	which is the art of what we do here.
1298820	1301240	He's carrying a very, very bulky briefcase.
1301240	1302740	It's almost like a suitcase.
1302740	1305860	It's way too large to be bringing
1305860	1307700	to a New Year's Eve party,
1307700	1310740	but he's got it tucked tightly under his arm
1310740	1312980	and he's kind of looking suspiciously
1312980	1314980	at the two people we've been paired up with.
1314980	1318540	And he's like, Harvey, I don't like the look of these chaps.
1318540	1321900	Upon hearing that Harvey is going to just mean mug
1321900	1324140	these other two guys in the car with us.
1324140	1328340	Yeah, I look at, you forgot my name?
1328340	1329460	Elden Ring, yeah.
1329460	1334460	I think we're all trying to forget your name, yeah.
1336820	1338580	Checkers looks at Elden.
1338620	1340940	Did he really just say that out loud?
1340940	1341780	Looking-
1341780	1343380	I said it so you couldn't hear.
1343380	1345060	We're all in a car together.
1345060	1345900	You have to get in a car.
1345900	1347100	Thomas, I can hear you.
1347100	1348540	I'm sitting right here.
1348540	1349380	You've got headphones on.
1349380	1350460	I have headphones on.
1353340	1354540	These guys look nice.
1354540	1356940	Do you think they'd be interested in our pitch?
1356940	1359540	Yeah, I don't understand why anyone wouldn't be.
1359540	1363740	As he's slowly just parting his super long black hair
1363740	1366580	that is now like completely covering his face,
1366580	1368380	he goes in with both hands
1368380	1371780	and kind of makes a window for his eyes in between
1371780	1374740	with a full middle part of this super long hair
1374740	1378940	and just lets off the most unattractive smile
1378940	1380980	at these two gentlemen.
1380980	1383780	I'm imagining like the girl from the ring.
1383780	1384620	Yeah.
1384620	1385460	I'm imagining cousin Elden Ring.
1385460	1387460	Elden Ring from the Addams family.
1387460	1388740	Yeah, there you go.
1388740	1392300	Lafayette is like sitting across from Elden
1392300	1395980	and he's got his like very long, like elegant legs,
1396340	1397740	like one folded over the other
1397740	1399700	and you can see his foot is tapping
1399700	1402980	just very, very anxiously and annoyedly,
1402980	1407260	sort of half glaring, half just studying this creature
1407260	1408580	that just sat down in front of him
1408580	1411100	and parted its weird, greasy hair.
1412380	1414940	Maybe ask him what his name is, Checkers.
1418820	1420980	You're supposed to be our charisma person.
1420980	1422380	Yeah, sorry.
1422380	1423580	It's early in the morning here.
1423580	1425900	Yeah, let's start that again.
1428260	1433260	Hello, Checkers, this is Elden, gentlemen.
1433980	1434900	It's nice to meet you.
1434900	1438660	Have you two heard the kind and good news of Checkers?
1438660	1442660	Yes, I think I have heard of what you lot get up to.
1442660	1445540	I pull like a little pamphlet out of my coat
1445540	1447100	and hand it over to Harley.
1447100	1449580	I don't like your presence in my town.
1449580	1452700	Well, this is not starting on a good foot.
1452700	1453980	None savory element.
1453980	1456860	Well, maybe we'll just leave each other
1456860	1461140	to what we like to do and we won't discuss this in the car.
1461140	1463620	As a man of science, yes, I'd prefer
1463620	1466100	if we left your hokum here at the station.
1466100	1467660	Checkers takes no offense to that
1467660	1471460	because he does not believe in what he's selling at all.
1471460	1473900	So he's just kind of like, fair enough.
1477220	1479780	And this is why your cult only has two people in it.
1479780	1484780	I'm just so sorry to say that I don't think
1485060	1486820	I can leave it there.
1486820	1490740	The world is bigger than your mind can comprehend, sir.
1490740	1491580	Hey.
1491580	1492780	He gets a kind of ride.
1493980	1495820	Hey, shut up.
1495820	1497180	He said he didn't want to hear about it.
1497180	1499140	Now Harvey, now Harvey.
1499140	1502100	He's beginning to speak on things of which he doesn't know.
1502100	1505260	Yes, it is quite a big world.
1505260	1506820	Elden, did you say your name was?
1506860	1509780	Yeah, sir Elden Ring, I gave my name to myself.
1509780	1512980	I explore some of those mysteries myself
1512980	1515420	in ways I don't think either of you two would comprehend.
1515420	1517420	What is it that you do, sir?
1517420	1518700	All manner of things.
1520420	1522180	Oh, right.
1523700	1528700	Nothing, I'm a lazy socialite dilettante.
1532020	1533340	Where is this accent going?
1533340	1535900	I like it, I like it, it feels right.
1536260	1537100	It feels right.
1537100	1539700	If that's the case, then you really should read this.
1539700	1542780	And I offer the pamphlet for my cult again.
1543700	1544980	Right.
1544980	1548300	He's suddenly like got a panic look and he's like,
1548300	1552300	okay, yes, that is what I would do
1552300	1556220	because I am a lazy gadabout.
1558780	1560780	Right, you're exactly what we're looking for.
1560780	1561620	Right.
1561620	1562460	Are you rich?
1562460	1563900	Yeah, yeah.
1563940	1565020	Good, okay.
1565020	1566820	It's a small fee to join,
1566820	1568780	but we'll talk about it when we get to the point.
1568780	1570500	The money is of no consequence
1570500	1572220	when you're dealing in eternity.
1572220	1573820	Give me your literature.
1577340	1578700	He hands it over to him.
1580220	1583500	He like reaches out with a handkerchief and grabs it.
1583500	1586220	It's like a handwritten like pamphlet.
1586220	1588860	What is this stain on?
1590580	1592180	What is this stain?
1593900	1594740	Thank you.
1597340	1599820	Just read the pamphlet and you'll understand.
1599820	1602380	It's magic.
1602380	1604020	Lafayette leans over like,
1605020	1606700	boy, that was a close one, Harvey.
1606700	1609340	We're to, you know, one up old Mordent
1609340	1612700	and unveil my invention and he pats the big box.
1612700	1614460	Nice.
1614460	1616340	Upstage him tonight.
1616340	1617740	We can't reveal my identity.
1617740	1620620	Did you, we're saying this to each other in confidence.
1620620	1622700	Did you come up with a cover name yet?
1622740	1625780	Oh God, I can't think of any name.
1627740	1630060	Like when Billy actor's like,
1631620	1633540	Billy actor's like, name a woman.
1638020	1639780	Just like, Janine Garofalo.
1641900	1643740	I also like to think that
1643740	1645580	while you're having this conversation,
1645580	1649300	supposedly in private, I mean, it's a small cab
1649300	1651500	and I'd like to think the other two can just overhear
1651500	1654300	every single fucking thing you're saying.
1654300	1656580	So do you guys know Mr. Mordaunt?
1656580	1659500	No, I'm lazy socialite, David Ellington.
1662220	1664740	And I've never met Mr. Mordaunt.
1664740	1665980	How'd you get invited?
1665980	1668220	I'm a prominent socialite.
1668220	1669420	And I'm his friend.
1669420	1670260	Fair enough.
1670260	1671220	This is my man.
1671220	1672100	Yes.
1672100	1674580	David and Harvey.
1674580	1675420	Goliath.
1675420	1677420	You said David and Goliath.
1677420	1682420	Easy, you know what, that's really easy to remember.
1684820	1686380	While you're having this conversation,
1686380	1690060	the car is passing, first of all, through the town itself,
1690060	1691380	which doesn't take very long.
1691380	1693380	It's not a big town.
1693380	1697780	And then heads off into, first of all, some country roads.
1697780	1702020	You're moving through some fairly light woodland
1702020	1703780	and then slightly thicker forest.
1703780	1708100	And you can see that you're moving towards
1708100	1710500	one of the big peaks around here.
1710500	1712140	Those of you who know the area
1712140	1713860	or who've looked at a map beforehand
1713860	1716300	might realize that it's Mount Ellen.
1716300	1720620	And you do seem to be moving towards the base of it.
1720620	1724180	And at some point you move off onto a private road,
1724180	1727260	which is much, much smaller.
1727260	1730420	And the driver's having to slow down a fair bit
1730420	1733620	at this stage because the snow's getting quite heavy.
1733860	1736540	Not heavy enough that he's losing control of the vehicle,
1736540	1739700	but visibility's suffering a little bit.
1739700	1741940	But more importantly, he's obviously fighting a bit
1741940	1743940	with traction on the road.
1743940	1747900	But as you get closer, you can start to see...
1749020	1752420	Well, first of all, have any of you been to the mount before
1752420	1754220	or is this your first visit?
1754220	1756020	For checkers, it's definitely the first visit.
1756020	1756860	Same.
1756860	1758820	I think it'd be Harvey's first visit for sure.
1758820	1762380	Yeah, probably before Harvey started working for Lafayette.
1762380	1764980	Lafayette had been and was kicked out.
1764980	1765820	Oh yeah.
1765820	1766660	Of course.
1766660	1767500	Yeah.
1767500	1770340	After he saw the debut of the self-playing violin
1770340	1771860	at New Year's Eve, like 1933.
1771860	1774340	Wait, did you unleash one of your own concepts
1774340	1775180	that same night?
1775180	1776660	I did.
1776660	1778060	And what was that?
1779580	1781180	What kind of jacket are you wearing?
1781180	1783380	He just picked up a violin and started playing it
1783380	1784220	and that was his invention.
1784220	1785940	That would be exactly, yeah.
1785940	1788700	What was that when you debuted the self-throwing tomato?
1789220	1794220	No, I just fucked Borden's wife that night.
1798700	1800460	He does not like me.
1800460	1801660	When you were kicked out, you're like,
1801660	1803780	you should invent a self-fucking you.
1807500	1808340	My God.
1809700	1811940	So that's what you've been working on ever since?
1813060	1814980	That's what he's got in the suitcase.
1816460	1817660	You don't know what he's been working on
1817660	1818500	and then he packed the box again.
1818500	1821300	I'm now horrified to find out what's in that suitcase.
1821300	1824620	What's in the box is super rad.
1824620	1827020	What's in the suitcase is going to carry
1827020	1829020	a D6, D20 sand loss, I think.
1830740	1833860	Yeah, for Morden, when he sees how fucking cool it is.
1837380	1839140	What do you got in there?
1839140	1840740	Yeah, that's a big box.
1840740	1841820	Party supplies.
1841820	1843140	Yeah, party supplies.
1843140	1844780	What kind of party supplies?
1844780	1847140	The kind that supply a party.
1847820	1848900	That's what the rich do.
1848900	1849740	Glassware?
1849740	1851700	Probably silverware.
1851700	1853060	You brought your own goblet?
1853060	1854660	There's some silver in it, yes.
1857420	1858940	I hope we're almost there.
1859940	1861620	You are almost there.
1861620	1864300	You've come over the ridge of a hill
1864300	1868900	and onto a little plateau towards the base of the mountain.
1868900	1873900	And yeah, there is the two-story colonial revival
1873900	1875980	style mansion that is the mount
1876020	1878380	with all its outbuildings around here.
1878380	1879580	Before you get to it, though,
1879580	1883620	you do pass by an odd-looking structure,
1883620	1886740	which Nathaiad doesn't recognize
1886740	1889580	as having been here the last time
1889580	1891300	that you visited the mount.
1891300	1893700	And it looks fairly incongruous.
1893700	1896980	It's just built on the edge of the property.
1896980	1900700	It looks initially like, you know,
1900700	1902460	maybe the kind of lookout tower
1902500	1906100	that you might get in the forest.
1906100	1907820	Like on the forest moon of Indor?
1909420	1911660	Yeah, like that maybe.
1913780	1915700	Sorry, am I lagging again?
1915700	1917140	It lagged pretty hard.
1917140	1919340	We missed a little bit of the description of the tower.
1919340	1921820	Sorry, I'll back up a bit then.
1921820	1924380	So you notice this weird structure
1924380	1928500	on the edge of the property that looks a bit like a tower,
1928500	1931500	maybe a lookout tower that, you know,
1931540	1933060	firefighters might use in a forest
1933060	1934660	or forest rangers, rather.
1934660	1936900	Like on the forest moon of Indor?
1936900	1938220	Oh, fuck's sake.
1943060	1944780	So you can see up atop the tower,
1944780	1948140	there is what looks like a glass structure.
1948140	1950140	I mean, I guess anyone who wants,
1950140	1951700	if you want to give me a spot,
1951700	1954100	hit and roll just to see what they can make out anymore.
1954100	1954940	Oh boy.
1958620	1961340	I passed a 10 on a base 25.
1962180	1963300	That is a hard success.
1963300	1964140	Nice.
1964140	1966980	I failed my roll, an 82 on a 70.
1966980	1969020	I got a 96.
1969020	1969860	On a?
1971100	1973180	On a 40.
1973180	1974780	So that is actually a fumble.
1974780	1976220	We'll get to you in a moment.
1977820	1978700	I love that rule.
1978700	1982620	So if it's over double your skill, it's a fumble?
1982620	1985860	If you roll 96 to 100 and your skill's under 50,
1985860	1986940	then it's a fumble.
1986940	1988100	If your skill is over 50,
1988100	1990420	you have to roll a double zero for it to be a fumble.
1990460	1991620	Okay, sick.
1991620	1993420	But what did Lafayette get?
1993420	1994460	87.
1994460	1997220	Okay, so I assume that's a failure.
1997220	1998540	Do you have a 90 spot hidden?
1998540	1999620	This is poor Cthulhu after all.
1999620	2001260	No, I have a 51.
2001260	2004420	So yeah, you do notice that there are some things
2004420	2006740	sticking out of the top as well
2006740	2010140	that look maybe like radio aerials.
2010140	2011820	Yeah, I mean, there are all sorts
2011820	2014380	of spiky protrusions coming out.
2014380	2017040	Master Checkers, do you see those spiky guys
2017040	2019300	coming out the top of that lookout tower?
2019340	2022820	Checkers is like writing another pamphlet real quick
2022820	2025940	and doesn't even pay attention to your question.
2025940	2028260	Well, I think then on the fumble,
2028260	2030660	then that's the point at which the car goes
2030660	2033460	over a big bump in the road and you just end up scoring
2033460	2035620	through all the magnificent pros that you've just written.
2035620	2036460	Oh, man.
2039300	2043140	Oh, another parchment down for the count, huh?
2043140	2046580	Yeah, my pencil I was using pokes me in the eye
2046580	2049620	and I'm like, just completely thrown off.
2049620	2050900	Are you okay, Master?
2050900	2053620	Just leave me alone for right now until we get to the party.
2053620	2058620	He's like trying to be as like gentle and fixie as he can
2059780	2063720	while still giving personal space to his favorite Checkers.
2066140	2068620	Well, the car pulls up in the courtyard
2068620	2071900	outside the main building and you can see
2071900	2073420	that there were a number of other cars now
2073420	2075980	that are parked there already.
2076260	2079460	A few guests have got out and some of them
2079460	2082260	are just going into the main entrance,
2082260	2084580	a few are making their way over there.
2084580	2087740	The house itself is largely lit up at the moment,
2087740	2090180	there are lights on in most of the rooms,
2090180	2094020	but the main activity seems to be coming
2094020	2097260	from a room over on the left-hand side
2097260	2100380	where you can see that there's a lot of bright light
2100380	2103300	coming out from the windows, there's the sound
2103300	2106420	of swing music playing rather loudly in there
2106420	2110420	and through the windows, you can see activity going on.
2110420	2113500	The other thing you can see is on the edifice
2113500	2118500	of the building, just above the window,
2118580	2120380	the front window of that room
2120380	2122140	where all the activity is going on,
2122140	2126100	there is what looks like another huge antenna
2126100	2128220	just sticking out of the wall
2128220	2130780	and some fairly thick cables coming down from it.
2130780	2133740	Checkers, there's another one right there.
2133740	2137140	He is writing another pamphlet and I'm paying attention.
2139260	2141580	Checkers, oh, okay, yeah, no, okay.
2141580	2143300	Antenna, sure, uh-huh.
2143300	2144740	I'll tell you what, I mean,
2144740	2148660	as Lafayette is actually a scientist,
2148660	2150980	what is your scientific specialization?
2150980	2153700	What scientific skills does Lafayette have?
2153700	2155100	Engineering is his focus
2155100	2157740	and mechanical, electrical, and computers.
2157740	2160180	Yep, then engineering is perfect for this.
2160180	2162180	If you want to give me an engineering role
2162180	2165900	to see whether you can make sense of this at all.
2168020	2170420	Yep, he passes 40 on a 90.
2170420	2172540	Yeah, you look at this aerial
2172540	2175060	and I mean, there's something weird about it.
2175060	2177620	It's not a design you've encountered before.
2177620	2181060	It doesn't look like an old radio aerial.
2181060	2182700	There's a bit of a dish behind it
2182700	2185540	and it looks like, I don't know,
2185540	2188780	maybe it's designed to focus something,
2188780	2192980	but yeah, there's something about it
2192980	2197980	that looks really strange and maybe novel.
2199340	2202660	Yeah, it's nothing like you've seen before.
2202660	2205660	He kind of plays with his little pencil-thin mustache
2205660	2209100	and he's like, what are you scheming at, Moldent?
2209100	2212420	Right behind you is Elden Ring
2212420	2214380	and he just like whispers in your ear
2214380	2216580	and he's like, what do you think it is?
2216580	2219460	He reflexively like elbows back.
2221540	2224900	I have a size 40, so I think you like elbow back
2224900	2227260	and I'm like a foot shorter
2227260	2229060	than you would have elbowed towards.
2229060	2231060	Yeah, he's a tall wisp.
2232740	2235540	I'm like an absolute waif of a man.
2236740	2238460	The sudden jerking of his elbow
2238460	2240180	to sneak up on the gentleman sends Harvey
2240180	2242420	into like protect mode and he grabs you
2242420	2243540	and just moves you away.
2243540	2245860	Oh, you can pick me up off the ground, yeah.
2245900	2247660	And as you do, he's just like,
2247660	2250540	oh, the strength of physicality is mighty,
2250540	2252420	but it's nothing compared to the mind.
2252420	2253780	I just want you to keep your distance
2253780	2255220	from here on out, you understand?
2255220	2257860	Hey, don't be touching, don't be touching me,
2257860	2258700	don't be touching him.
2258700	2260180	Why are you talking to my man like that?
2260180	2261060	Because he's touching him.
2261060	2262900	My man is having a conversation with your man
2262900	2264220	because your man was touching me.
2264220	2266420	Conversation doesn't have to involve hands
2266420	2267580	or picking people up.
2267580	2269140	Keep your man away from my man.
2269140	2269980	Deal.
2271500	2274060	Harvey's still holding Elden up in the air
2274060	2276900	and Elden's feet are twiddling back and forth
2276900	2281060	and he is staring directly into Harvey's eyes
2281060	2282980	and making a choice.
2284020	2286420	And then his eyes kind of soften.
2286420	2287760	I don't wanna hurt you.
2288940	2293340	Harvey laughs as he sets him back down on the ground.
2293340	2295100	Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sure you don't.
2295100	2297100	I certainly do not.
2297100	2299460	There's a little bit in Harvey that's like,
2299460	2300940	what, what, what, what?
2301500	2305020	So Elden Ring has a 90 in Intimidate.
2306780	2309660	Also probably people don't talk back to Harvey much at all.
2309660	2311060	I was gonna say I have an 80.
2313900	2317960	Just two very strong-willed minds staring at each other.
2318940	2319780	That's cool.
2319780	2322260	Elden, do you have our invitations?
2322260	2327260	He kind of pats at his chest softly and slowly
2328100	2332380	before grabbing the invitations out of his trouser pocket.
2334380	2336900	Yeah, I mean, you can scurry in out of the cold.
2336900	2339580	The snow is getting a bit heavier at this stage.
2339580	2342980	You can see that the chauffeurs, having dropped people off,
2342980	2345060	are running over to one of the outbuildings
2345060	2348080	where it looks like they've got their own party in progress,
2348080	2350300	just on the other side of the courtyard.
2350300	2355300	But the main doors of the manor house are open
2355780	2358060	and there's a maid there.
2358060	2359620	Oh, in fact, there are a few maids there
2359620	2362100	who seem to be ushering guests in in shifts
2362100	2363460	and taking their coats.
2363460	2366780	And yeah, there's a uniformed maid who comes up
2366780	2370140	and looks around at the bunch of you and says,
2370140	2372500	can I take your coats?
2372500	2374720	Looks at Elden and blinks.
2375660	2379260	And on cue, I could pull the drawstring
2379260	2380660	coming out of his butt.
2380660	2382120	The warmth is inside me.
2382280	2386480	Very good, sir.
2386480	2388280	Checkers hands his coat over
2388280	2392720	and then grabs a bunch of pamphlets out of the pocket
2392720	2395680	as he's handing it over, puts them in his pocket.
2395680	2397440	Elden Ring gets really serious
2397440	2400680	as Checkers hands over his coat and is like,
2400680	2405360	do not misplace the master's coat.
2405360	2407120	Yeah, I just bought it.
2407120	2410880	It was expensive, so put it in a special place.
2410880	2412960	The maid now carrying those, the three coats,
2412960	2414280	is standing there looking at the bunch of you
2414280	2415840	wishing to get a word in edgeways.
2415840	2420040	She eventually says, if you make your way
2420040	2421840	over to the ballroom, and she points out
2421840	2424320	from under all the coats, a set of double doors
2424320	2426760	that are open just over on your left.
2426760	2431120	The hallway that you're in is fairly large.
2431120	2433040	There's a chandelier overhead
2433040	2434840	because of course the fuck he is.
2435680	2439840	And I mean, certainly Lafayette knows
2439840	2442280	from his previous visits to the mount
2442280	2447280	that while Mordent has money, money doesn't buy taste
2448160	2453160	and the furnishings, some of them are quite nice pieces,
2453840	2457400	but he has no eye for how things go together.
2457400	2462040	The decor is generally tacky
2462080	2464880	for people who've got genuine taste.
2464880	2467800	My God, Harvey, look at that chandelier.
2467800	2469400	I know, it's gorgeous, isn't it?
2470840	2474840	Oh, Harvey, he's a simple man.
2476880	2478560	No, it's quite hideous, actually.
2478560	2480600	I tell you what, if I ever got this kind of money,
2480600	2481560	I'd do it up like this.
2481560	2483800	Look at this, this is the lap of luxury here.
2484680	2486360	You're a kind man, Harvey.
2486360	2487720	Thank you for watching after me.
2487720	2489200	If you think this is luxurious,
2489200	2490680	you should see our joint.
2491640	2495240	No, we are not spending time together this evening.
2495240	2499480	We are moving, why are you still right next to us?
2499480	2501560	It's a party, it's a party.
2502560	2505280	Yes, Eldon, so please, please go mingle.
2505280	2508320	Eldon, the suitcase guy, he's off the list,
2508320	2511400	but his friend, he seems like somebody we could get.
2513400	2517360	Spend tonight pestering and harassing my man.
2517360	2520400	Correct, we will be having pleasant conversation
2520960	2523720	about the last branch and all the good that we're doing.
2524680	2526400	You seem like a guy that wants to do big things.
2526400	2528600	Come now, Harvey, come along, come, Harvey.
2528600	2530880	Well, we'll have chandeliers like this eventually.
2530880	2532960	Harvey dutifully just follows Lafayette.
2532960	2534040	Remember the chandeliers.
2534040	2534880	Chandeliers.
2538320	2541880	Eldon, the famous actress that we're looking for,
2541880	2544360	I know her name, but do you remember it?
2544360	2546240	I love Test's master.
2546240	2548600	Yes, her name is Candace Germain.
2548600	2550320	Correct, let's find her.
2551200	2555320	And he motions his head forward for some sort of physical.
2556880	2560200	Before we start splitting, are we in party town now?
2560200	2561040	Is there?
2561040	2562680	Are we in party town?
2562680	2564520	Yes, Harvey, you may have one drink.
2568360	2572160	So yes, you've come in through this rather grand hallway
2572160	2574160	and there are corridors branching off
2574160	2575280	in a few different directions.
2575280	2578040	You can see that there are other sets of double doors
2578080	2581240	around here that are obviously going into other rooms
2581240	2583480	that may be off limits to you.
2583480	2588320	There's a staircase going up to the upstairs, obviously,
2588320	2593320	but all the action seems to be in the ballroom.
2593920	2597440	You're ushered through the double doors there
2597440	2601960	to this fairly grand looking room.
2601960	2604160	Doesn't really have much in the way of furniture
2604160	2605960	in it at the moment because it is a ballroom.
2605960	2610000	It's got a few side tables set up with snacks and drinks
2610000	2615000	and there are uniform staff wandering around with trays,
2615000	2617840	again, with refreshments on them.
2617840	2621640	There are a few dozen people in attendance.
2621640	2625120	It's quite a large ballroom and maybe the guest list
2625120	2627240	is very exclusive or maybe a number of people
2627240	2629760	just plain haven't turned up.
2629760	2633160	But I mean, the party is relatively lively,
2633160	2636160	but it's not exactly jumping, it's not packed.
2636160	2639000	There is a stage that is set up
2639000	2642120	over in front of the front window.
2642120	2643400	And you can see a few things there.
2643400	2646440	One, the most obvious thing is there is a live band
2646440	2649840	that is playing there, a live swing band.
2649840	2653760	And there is just off to the side of the stage as well
2653760	2656760	and some bulky shapes, boxy shapes
2656760	2660560	that are covered by sheets or a tarpaulin.
2660560	2663000	What kind of size is that covered thing?
2663680	2666880	Fairly large, maybe about the size of a car.
2666880	2669920	I mean, it probably doesn't take much to work out
2669920	2674440	that it roughly corresponds to where you saw the cable
2674440	2677160	come down from the aerial outside.
2677160	2679480	But yeah, as I said, there are a few dozen people
2679480	2682840	mingling around, a few of them dancing.
2682840	2686640	A number of them not dancing, but certainly having drinks
2686640	2689640	and talking or shouting at each other over the music.
2689640	2693240	Harvey wants to do his job as a bodyguard to Lafayette.
2693240	2694880	When we walk in the room, just kind of clock it,
2694880	2696200	see if there's anything that could maybe
2696200	2697320	pose a threat to him.
2697320	2700920	Okay, I'll tell you what, give me a psychology roll
2700920	2703000	to get a general read of the crowd.
2705680	2708600	Oh shoot, it's a fail, a 67 on a 50.
2708600	2711400	Well, I mean, you could either spend 17 points of luck
2711400	2714600	or if you want, you could find some way of pushing it.
2714600	2717760	I mean, if you can think of a way of escalating
2717760	2720040	the situation and potentially putting yourself at risk
2720040	2722920	while assessing threats, I'd be open to that.
2724200	2725880	You could probably get a better vantage point
2725880	2727520	if you're on the chandelier.
2727520	2728360	Yeah.
2731360	2734560	Actually, could I maybe go and put myself up on stage
2734560	2736240	to look down from the stage?
2736240	2738360	Oh, okay, yeah, I mean, you could try.
2738360	2741600	Yeah, I mean, there is a little set of wooden stairs
2741600	2743640	up to the side that you could go on.
2743640	2745760	Like I say, there is a full swing band up there
2745760	2749200	who are very much in the midst of a song, but...
2749200	2753200	Yep, so Harvey's gonna bumble his way up there.
2753200	2756720	Okay, yeah, I think if you fail the push here,
2757680	2760440	you'll get to attract all sorts of the wrong attention.
2763440	2765680	I pass, a 21 on a 50.
2765680	2769800	Fantastic, so you get a rough read
2769800	2773000	of the kinds of people who are in the room.
2773040	2777640	There are a few people who are obviously moneyed.
2777640	2780600	You can tell from their clothes, from their mannerisms
2780600	2782560	that, yeah, there are definitely
2782560	2784440	a few movers and shakers here.
2784440	2786360	Lafayette has like snuck up behind,
2786360	2790280	like he followed Harvey very poorly,
2790280	2791920	kind of like crouched down behind him,
2791920	2793680	and he's like, tell me what you see.
2793680	2795640	He pokes out behind him on the stage and he's like,
2795640	2798240	oh, I see some of my cousins here, this is...
2800240	2801080	I didn't wanna see.
2801080	2802280	You can see a few other people
2802280	2804920	who don't necessarily fit the same mold,
2804920	2809560	and there's something about the slightly more worn
2809560	2814560	looking clothing and general introvertedness
2814680	2817840	that makes you think that they're probably academics.
2817840	2819880	Then there are a few other people
2819880	2821240	who just don't seem to fit in.
2821240	2825280	You do spot, I don't know whether you heard
2825280	2827400	the others mentioning Candace Germaine earlier,
2827400	2829920	but I mean, you certainly do spot her in the crowd
2829920	2833040	and you may have seen some of her films.
2833040	2836080	She seems to be in deep conversation at the moment
2836080	2841080	with a fairly good looking man in clerical garb
2841360	2844840	wearing a black shirt and a dog collar,
2844840	2847880	who, you know, the two of them
2847880	2850120	are in very animated conversation.
2850120	2852120	Do I clock Mordant in the room?
2852120	2856040	No, looking around, Mordant isn't there.
2856040	2856880	Okay.
2856880	2859040	Which may strike you as being a bit odd.
2859360	2861680	You know, we got the usual sword here, boss.
2861680	2863040	We got the real money,
2863040	2865920	we got the guys who are more like you, the thinkers,
2865920	2867160	and it looks like there's a,
2867160	2871480	you seen that picture show, Last Train to Clarksville?
2871480	2873640	That's Candace Germaine right there.
2873640	2875720	Good God, Candace Germaine is in here.
2876720	2877680	A true beauty.
2877680	2878720	Where'd you say you saw her?
2878720	2880440	Well, we're not there, but.
2880440	2881800	Yeah, when we look behind
2881800	2883440	and you're crouched down behind me.
2883440	2888440	I turn around and Eldon parts his hair.
2890040	2892600	I'd love to think as well that you're kind of
2892600	2896160	in between the guitarist and the bassist of the swing band
2896160	2898280	and the two of them are just stepping around you
2898280	2900920	as they're doing their act, trying not to tread on you.
2902160	2904960	We're becoming real quick pals here, huh?
2904960	2906680	Don't step on any wires.
2906680	2908520	No, that is do not step on any wires
2908520	2909880	because there's something very strange
2909880	2914720	going on here tonight with all of his wires.
2916240	2918560	I haven't noticed anything, but.
2919000	2920720	Cicero is up to something.
2920720	2924600	Master Checkers, that's Candace Germaine right there
2924600	2926760	that they were pointing and talking about,
2926760	2928160	talking to the cleric man.
2928160	2930560	I pull out a pamphlet and look at Eldon
2930560	2932680	and I just kind of nod at him.
2932680	2933720	Bring her to me.
2935520	2937320	Well, yeah, as he's saying that,
2937320	2940400	she breaks off conversation with the vicar or the priest
2940400	2944200	or whatever he is and she walks over
2944200	2946200	and starts talking to someone else.
2946240	2950360	So was Eldon going over to join the conversation?
2950360	2953160	I was trying to get the more charismatic
2953160	2955280	or good looking one to start the conversation.
2955280	2958520	We kind of have a thing where if we can isolate someone,
2958520	2962480	we can slowly work them down into joining us.
2962480	2964200	So is it Checkers who's going over?
2964200	2966840	Checkers heads on over to Ms. Germaine.
2966840	2970600	Yeah, she's there talking to an older man,
2970600	2973120	looks like he's probably in his late 50s,
2973160	2975840	dressed in a three piece suit.
2975840	2977680	He's fairly jowdy.
2977680	2979640	He's got red features,
2980480	2985480	a few broken veins across his face and ruby eyes
2985520	2987880	and the two of them seem to be
2987880	2990440	just making small talk as you come up.
2990440	2993080	Or you could give me an education roll
2993080	2995320	to see what they can recognize who the man is.
2996320	2998560	That's a pass, 43 on a 70.
2998560	3000120	Okay, yeah, you recognize the man
3000120	3001400	from some newspaper articles
3001440	3003840	who's seen as Charlton Billings.
3003840	3005840	He's a Senator from Vermont.
3005840	3009400	I go to him first, Senator, nice to see you.
3009400	3012760	My name is, you can just call me Checkers.
3013880	3016160	And I reach my hand out to shake his hand.
3016160	3018200	Well, he gives you a warm handshake
3018200	3023200	and says Checkers, just the one name then.
3023880	3026040	Right, it's what my friends call me in.
3026040	3027240	We're all friends here.
3027240	3029080	Oh, I hope so, I hope so.
3029120	3032200	I hope I can count on your vote next year.
3032200	3034840	Absolutely, I actually have a friend here with me
3034840	3038400	who may not be so inclined to vote for you,
3038400	3041040	but maybe you could go convince him.
3041040	3043400	And I gesture at Eldon.
3044240	3047120	Eldon is in an enclave of this room already,
3047120	3048920	like away from the crowd.
3048920	3052000	And he's just staring through his parted hair
3052000	3053480	across the party.
3053480	3057760	He has some very serious feelings about
3057760	3059440	Senator things.
3062920	3065640	The Senator looks over at Eldon,
3065640	3069400	kind of looks him up and down and looks back at you.
3069400	3071400	Fucking Oren from Parks and Rec.
3073800	3076400	That's exactly who it is.
3076400	3079120	He says, are you sure he votes?
3079120	3084120	Only when he really loves or hates something.
3088000	3090920	And he's got strong feelings.
3090920	3094320	And then I wink at him and I want to roll charm.
3094320	3095280	Okay, yeah.
3096520	3097520	That's a three.
3097520	3099840	Oh, it's a really good wink.
3099840	3102960	He says, well, a voter's a voter, I suppose.
3102960	3107400	And he turns and marches over towards Eldon.
3107400	3108680	God help him.
3108680	3109840	Candace.
3109840	3113480	And I do like the European kiss the cheeks greeting.
3113480	3115200	Ah, checkers, you made it.
3115200	3117080	I'm here, thank you for the invite.
3117080	3119960	You can see that she's looking a bit ruddy
3119960	3121320	and swaying a bit.
3122920	3124440	The party hasn't been going for that long,
3124440	3126640	but it looks like she's quite drunk already.
3126640	3127840	Does she have a drink in her hand?
3127840	3129000	Oh, absolutely, yeah.
3129000	3130760	Oh, let me take that from you.
3130760	3132640	It's, I'll hold it for you.
3132640	3134400	And I grab the like martini
3134400	3136000	and I just like drink the rest of it
3136000	3138400	and hand her back an empty glass.
3138960	3140520	She looks at you and pats you on the shoulder.
3140520	3141680	That's what I do with Luke sometimes.
3141680	3144400	Oh, it's all right, I can get another.
3144400	3146520	Oh, that's probably good.
3146520	3147400	You're probably good.
3147400	3150720	No, no, no, she says, it's all right, it's all right.
3153600	3154920	Give me a moment.
3154920	3156760	I'll pay a visit to the ladies room
3156760	3160400	and powder my nose if you know what I mean.
3160400	3162640	And I'm sure I'll be fine after that.
3162640	3163480	Cocaine.
3163480	3165680	I sure do know what you mean.
3165680	3166880	Perfect, well.
3166880	3168840	You're welcome to join me if you want.
3169920	3170760	Sure.
3170760	3171600	Yay.
3174960	3176920	We got cocaine into this campaign.
3179200	3181080	Our perfect record is untouched.
3182960	3186280	If Eldon or Checkers had looked up
3186280	3187360	at any point in that time,
3187360	3190680	they would have seen Lafayette and Harvey slipping out
3190680	3192480	of the main ballroom,
3192480	3194840	trying to follow some of these wires
3194840	3197800	and some of the weird mechanical things
3197800	3198800	that he's seeing here.
3198800	3201320	Okay, so basically you're heading out the front
3201320	3202920	to where that aerial was.
3202920	3203760	Yeah.
3203760	3206120	As you see Checkers and Candace walk into the bathroom,
3206120	3209200	he's like grabbing like champagne off the waiters,
3209200	3211120	like things and just like downing it
3211120	3213320	because he's actually never done drugs
3213320	3214480	and he's very nervous.
3216960	3218560	This is a big get for your cult.
3218560	3219680	Oh yeah, huge.
3219680	3220960	Also you're 19.
3222440	3223280	I'm underage drinking.
3223320	3225160	The movie star just asked you to go to the bathroom
3225160	3227840	to get cocaine, which is pretty cool.
3227840	3229880	I assume she's probably,
3229880	3231960	is she like a late twenties actress
3231960	3233160	or is she like established?
3233160	3234160	It's 1937.
3234160	3236320	Yeah, no, she's a few years older than you
3236320	3237360	but not a lot older.
3237360	3238600	Okay, cool.
3238600	3243600	You find a bathroom and she cuts a few lines for you
3244200	3248920	and just makes a bit of small talk and says,
3248920	3250360	do you manage to get here all right?
3250360	3252040	Well, of course you managed to get here all right
3252040	3253640	because you're here, aren't you?
3254760	3257240	Sorry, I don't know where my head is today
3257240	3258520	and snorts another line.
3260840	3264120	You know, sometimes parties can be a little overwhelming
3264120	3266640	and then he looks at the lines of coke
3266640	3268160	on the bathroom counter
3268160	3270840	and not knowing the protocol for this,
3270840	3273680	he does all the rest of the lines of cocaine.
3275360	3277440	We're gonna need you to roll a con check
3277440	3278880	to make sure you don't die.
3278880	3280120	This is a new one that we're trying out
3280160	3282000	where when you actually do drugs in the game,
3282000	3283600	you have to do drugs as the player.
3283600	3284720	We're method playing.
3284720	3287680	So give us about two and a half hours
3287680	3292680	while we go find some cocaine and we'll be right back.
3292920	3296280	Candace smiles at checkers as he does
3296280	3298560	the last three lines single-handedly
3298560	3301760	and says, oh my, aren't you a hungry little boy?
3304200	3308200	I'm not that little, he says with his 40 size.
3309200	3313280	Oh my God, I didn't realize where my tiny was.
3313280	3314920	I've got a big personality.
3314920	3317160	If 40 size is good enough for Charlie Manson,
3317160	3318600	it's good enough for you.
3318600	3319440	Exactly.
3324280	3326320	Candace, have you thought any more
3326320	3329360	about our last conversation about last branch
3329360	3331560	and maybe be in the face of it?
3331560	3333200	Yes, yes.
3333200	3334560	Though, I don't know.
3334560	3337480	I think I may have other commitments now.
3338320	3339880	I think I'm going to be employed
3339880	3343000	to help promote Cicero's new invention.
3343000	3345880	Our deal wouldn't necessarily be exclusive.
3345880	3348280	You know, you could, it could just be something
3348280	3350440	you mentioned when you do everything else that you do.
3350440	3354040	Oh, maybe, but this has got to take up all my time.
3354040	3355720	It's got to change the world, you know.
3355720	3357720	What is his invention?
3357720	3359960	She looks confused for a moment.
3361760	3363040	It's got to change the world.
3363040	3365840	Well, you know, maybe we could go talk to him.
3365840	3367520	Maybe you could introduce me to him.
3367520	3368880	I haven't met him yet either.
3368880	3370880	I don't know where he is.
3370880	3375120	Oh, she roots through her purse a bit and says,
3375120	3377320	and that was the last of the cocaine.
3377320	3380480	Oh, but I suppose someone else here must have some.
3380480	3382280	Do you think you could find some more for me?
3382280	3383800	I'm sure I could, yeah.
3383800	3385080	I'll look around.
3386120	3388840	In the meantime, he pulls out a piece of paper
3388840	3392360	and you can tell it's like a crudely drawn up contract.
3393320	3394720	And he...
3394720	3397160	It's like stick figures and it's like,
3397680	3398680	just him giving her the paper
3398680	3400280	and the paper says your soul.
3401960	3404080	No, basically it's like a contract he's written up
3404080	3406720	to have her be kind of like the spokesperson
3406720	3408440	for the last branch.
3408440	3410000	And he hands it to her, he's like,
3410000	3414040	real quick while I go look for more fun,
3414040	3415960	just sign this at the bottom here.
3415960	3418560	Well, I'll get my lawyer to look at it
3418560	3419520	and send it back to you.
3419520	3422040	Oh, we don't need, I studied,
3422040	3423640	I took a couple law classes.
3423640	3424480	She laughs.
3424480	3425800	It's a pretty good contract.
3425840	3428400	She laughs and playfully punches you in the shoulder
3428400	3431720	and says, after all the things that happened with the MGM,
3431720	3434160	my lawyer told me never to sign anything again
3434160	3435280	without talking to him.
3435280	3436120	Yeah.
3436120	3439400	Checkers figured that this was coming,
3439400	3441720	but he had to take his chance anyway.
3441720	3444360	So he grabs the contract back, folds it up
3444360	3445920	and he's like, okay, well,
3445920	3448480	I'll talk to you when I find more.
3448480	3449320	Yes, yes, yes.
3449320	3451480	But don't forget cocaine.
3451480	3453880	Right, right, I'm on it.
3453880	3456320	And he leaves the bathroom and it's in his mind,
3456320	3459240	but it really, he isn't gonna actively be looking
3459240	3461080	for drugs.
3461080	3464120	Oh, she's got to be so disbunched in you.
3465800	3469440	He's also like experiencing cocaine for the first time ever
3469440	3473160	and he's stoked and scared to death.
3473160	3474480	And in like 20 minutes,
3474480	3476120	he's gonna be looking for more cocaine.
3476120	3477440	Yes, absolutely.
3480560	3483760	Okay, well, let's cut back to Lafayette
3483760	3488160	and Harvey as they're heading outside in the snow.
3488160	3489960	And now without your coats,
3489960	3492280	you can appreciate just how cold it is out there.
3492280	3495280	The snow's coming down quite heavily now.
3495280	3498560	But you can see, yeah, there is this thick wire
3498560	3500640	that's coming through the wall.
3500640	3503560	In fact, it's like a bunch of cables
3503560	3505200	that have been bound together
3505200	3508240	that are going up to this aerial.
3508240	3512440	Lafayette gives that wire an expert and knowledgeable lick.
3514680	3518240	I'm giving the cold temperature out here.
3521000	3522800	A little Christmas story going on.
3522800	3524200	Oh, God.
3524200	3525800	Do you want to give me a luck roll
3525800	3528600	to see whether your tongue ends up frozen to the cables?
3529480	3532360	My name is David Ellington.
3532360	3534880	My God, Harvey, I've made quite a bit thick.
3536880	3538400	Pass, 17 on a 55.
3538400	3539400	Okay, yeah.
3539400	3541360	I mean, you pull it away just in time
3541360	3544080	so you can feel the ice crystals falling across.
3544080	3546800	The main thing the cable tastes of is cold.
3547840	3549560	He makes a note of that.
3551080	3553640	I actually said that at a wine tasting one time.
3553640	3555200	Everyone's looking at me weird.
3557840	3559320	But looking at it,
3559320	3562240	yeah, I mean, you passed your engineering role earlier,
3562240	3564280	so I won't ask you to roll again.
3564280	3565320	So looking at this,
3565320	3570080	you're fairly certain that this is a power cable.
3570080	3572480	In fact, it looks like it's designed
3572480	3575520	to carry quite a lot of power,
3575520	3578600	but it's just going up to this aerial contraption,
3578600	3581480	which doesn't really make a lot of sense to you.
3581480	3583120	And you can see as well
3583120	3585560	that the aerial is pointing in the direction
3585560	3588040	of that wooden tower
3588040	3592800	that you saw across on the outskirts of the compound.
3596320	3599120	Is there anywhere I can unplug it, this power source?
3600400	3602200	Not without tools, not easily.
3602200	3605160	I mean, you could try just ripping it out,
3605160	3608880	but this is like industrial cabling.
3608880	3611240	If you're going to try to sabotage it like that,
3611240	3615680	it would require, yeah, for a start, tools, a bit of time.
3615680	3618360	You probably need a ladder to get up there.
3618360	3619360	I mean, it's not impossible.
3619360	3621880	It's just under the circumstances a bit tricky.
3621880	3624680	So he gives it a few very honest tugs.
3624680	3627440	He's honestly trying to unplug it.
3627440	3629200	But when he realizes it's going nowhere,
3629240	3630800	he sets it down and he's like,
3630800	3633400	only joking, Harvey, we don't want to win that way.
3636880	3640000	Do I have a sense of what any of this could be for?
3640000	3643240	Do you have the weird science, pulp talent?
3643240	3644080	I do.
3644080	3647680	Okay, you made your engineering role earlier.
3647680	3650920	Yeah, you don't know entirely for sure.
3650920	3655000	You'd have to go and take a look at what's in that tower
3655000	3656680	to tell for sure.
3656680	3658840	But there's something nagging your way
3658840	3660880	at the back of your brain.
3660880	3663840	You're thinking of some of the wilder designs
3663840	3666760	that Nikola Tesla came up with.
3666760	3671760	And this looks maybe like it's designed
3671840	3674880	for the wireless transmission of electricity.
3674880	3679400	Harvey, this isn't normal science.
3679400	3681600	You turn and Harvey's licking the wire that you...
3681600	3684360	Harvey, you fool.
3685280	3686120	There's nothing to learn from that,
3686120	3687480	but that it tastes of cold.
3688760	3690000	That's exactly what I was going to say.
3690000	3691000	It tastes like cold.
3692040	3693120	Harvey, please listen.
3693120	3694480	This is terribly important.
3695800	3698040	Again, this is not normal science.
3699120	3700160	How are we talking?
3703040	3708040	I didn't know a body could be hollow
3708040	3713040	before its blood ran cold.
3715680	3720680	I didn't know that the wind could sew
3722400	3727400	the tissue and fagged bone.
3729600	3734600	You were hollow when you spoke to me.
3735600	3740600	Hollow when you sang.
3742720	3747720	I thought you might be starving.
3749200	3754200	So I gave you everything.
3756960	3761960	Thought you were hollow.
3762960	3767960	Thorns and rocks and devils' clothes
3767960	3772960	and briars and dry-baked clay.
3772960	3776960	Crocus blossoms in February
3776960	3781960	and Dalian in May.
3782960	3786960	Time between a mother's fingers
3786960	3790960	and spit off a bridge.
3792960	3796960	Restless legs at 3 p.m.
3796960	3800960	while waiting for a fix.
3821960	3826960	So come back here
3843960	3848960	and see what's left of me.
3849960	3854960	Is this the wholesome girl you left in Missouri?
3858960	3863960	My voice is nothing now
3863960	3868960	but the howl of the wind
3868960	3873960	come closer to my teeth
3873960	3878960	rattling my jaw.
3879960	3882960	Come closer dear
3882960	3886960	you might see
3886960	3891960	rattling my jaw.
