0	2000	What's snazzy, my pips?
2000	8500	It's your knobby, sloppy, off-the-cobby, radio host with the absolute most.
8500	13800	Your butter and egg man with jams and toast, it's Wolf the dog.
13800	17300	If you're not yet big, then you may be a grower,
17300	21300	cuz I'm blowin' your wig from my radio blower.
21300	29300	Here on 694.2 PTBP, the internet's oldest and only radio station.
29300	36800	This installment of Howlin' with Wolf is from The Duckman in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
36800	37800	They write,
37800	40000	To the boys of Best Korea,
40000	42300	Wibble Wobble Dingle Chungus,
42300	44600	Wumbo Dingo Tringus,
44600	47500	and a whole lotta love to you, Wolf,
47500	52300	for introducing me to the magical musicians of Missouri known as Kudzu.
52300	54800	No backbone is the bee's knees.
54800	57300	You're the top dog in my books, Wolf.
57300	58800	Keep up that good work,
58800	63800	and I hope you find some extra good scraps in tonight's trash can.
63800	65800	You shred it, Wheat.
65800	69300	Remember, if you wanna write up somethin' for your wolf to howl,
69300	70800	tag us on the internet,
70800	72800	uh-uh, fuck Mark Zuckerberg,
72800	76800	or write a five-star review on Apple Podcasts.
76800	81300	All the links are in the damn show notes like they always have been.
81300	83800	Why don't y'all take a look for one second?
83800	84800	I'll wait.
85800	91800	I found a handy-dandy little book here of common phrases used back in the 1930s
91800	96800	to set the stage for the special presentation I have for you today.
96800	98800	So, uh, shake a leg,
98800	100800	split with those getaway sticks,
100800	104800	and grab a swell glass of city juice with your meat paws.
104800	108800	In my cave, it's all wet to be dried out,
108800	111800	so double down on your dog soup.
111800	113800	I might be behind the grind,
113800	117800	but these fine expressions from the time of Great Depression,
117800	119800	they align with wolf's obsessions.
119800	123800	Now, time to perform my midnight profession.
123800	127800	So unwind from uniform strife and oppression,
127800	131800	and mainline this newfangled warm-life lesson.
131800	135800	It's Grady Philip Drug with Real Life.
143800	148800	Easy times feel less than serene
148800	155800	In the moment it's hard to count your blessings
155800	161800	So we long for days gone past
161800	165800	As grief and strife
165800	171800	Bloody, that's real life
174800	177800	Moment of silence, 30 seconds of silence
177800	182800	for our nearly departed dipshit in the Oval Office.
182800	188800	I said silence, Joe.
188800	191800	Don't make jokes, Zach.
203800	213800	That's, that's 30, right?
213800	216800	That was close.
216800	221800	Zach, Zach, before you clarified Oval Office,
221800	223800	when you said nearly departed dipshit,
223800	228800	I thought you were talking about Luke.
228800	234800	Oh, no!
234800	237800	His Scott is our, he is our dipshit.
237800	240800	We love him a lot.
240800	242800	Oh, we miss you, Luke.
242800	244800	Luke isn't here with us today,
244800	250800	but who is with us today is a man who I've spent a lot of time
250800	255800	listening to and learning from about Call of Cthulhu
255800	258800	and other horror gaming in general,
258800	262800	Mr. Scott Dorward, whose credits include
262800	266800	working on Cubicle Seven's World War Cthulhu line,
266800	269800	let's see, working on Dead of Night,
269800	271800	Cthulhu Dark,
271800	274800	Pulp Cthulhu's first campaign, the Two-Headed Serpent,
274800	278800	and of course, he is one of the good friends of Jackson Elias
278800	282800	over on the absolutely delightful podcast,
282800	285800	The Good Friends of Jackson Elias.
285800	287800	Thanks for joining us, Scott.
287800	290800	Oh, well, thank you so much for inviting me, Zach.
290800	292800	This is a great pleasure,
292800	295800	and I am looking forward to putting you through hell.
295800	298800	Yeah, that's what we like to hear.
298800	301800	Ooh, love being on the other side of it.
301800	306800	Can you give us a quick rundown of who you are
306800	310800	for the people listening at home and what you do?
310800	312800	Yes, okay.
312800	315800	Or I can just say everything I just said again.
315800	319800	No, no, I can introduce myself.
319800	322800	I'm a big boy.
322800	325800	Yes.
325800	328800	So, yes, I'm Scott Dorward.
328800	331800	I am a writer and editor.
331800	334800	I've worked primarily on Call of Cthulhu products,
334800	338800	but done work on a number of other RPGs.
339800	344800	I do a bunch of podcasting,
344800	346800	as well as The Good Friends of Jackson Elias,
346800	348800	which Zach mentioned.
348800	351800	I'm also a cast member on the How We Roll podcast
351800	356800	and a semi-regular on Ain't Slayed Nobody.
356800	360800	So, yeah, I am.
360800	365800	I get around, but yes, it is.
365800	368800	Well, we're glad to have you as our bedfellow this evening
368800	371800	running The Bleak Prospect here.
371800	373800	To lead our nightmares.
373800	375800	Yes. Well, thank you very much.
375800	377800	Yeah, this scenario, Bleak Prospect,
377800	381800	comes from the Chaosium publication Nameless Horrors,
381800	385800	which was the first book that Matt Sanderson, Paul Fricker,
385800	387800	and I, The Good Friends of Jackson Elias,
387800	390800	did for Chaosium some years back.
390800	395800	And, yeah, this is not a happy scenario,
395800	398800	but I'm sure we can find a few laughs in there,
398800	403800	even if they're just sort of bitter laughs of despair.
403800	406800	You can rely on us for those, for sure.
406800	407800	Excellent.
407800	413800	So the scenario takes place in November of 1932.
413800	418800	The setup is that you are all residents of the same shanty town
418800	423800	on the outskirts of a town called Crawley in Massachusetts.
423800	429800	The residents of the shanty town, or Hooverville as it's often known as,
429800	433800	are all people who have fallen through the cracks of society
433800	435800	in the Great Depression.
435800	437800	The Great Depression has been going on for a couple of years now
437800	440800	and things are bleak.
440800	444800	This shanty town is perhaps a little more afflicted than most, however,
444800	451800	because as well as the normal depredations of poverty and homelessness,
451800	455800	you're also having to contend with a mystery disease
455800	458800	that is going through the camp as well.
458800	465800	The illness is proving hard to pin down.
465800	467800	Dr. Coombs, who we'll get to in a moment,
467800	472800	has been doing some work on trying to research it and understand it
472800	476800	and maybe find some way of helping the people who are afflicted.
476800	484800	The main symptoms seem to be lethargy, muscle wasting,
484800	492800	perhaps flaking skin, and just general sickness.
492800	495800	People are just run down.
495800	498800	The effect on the camp is varied.
498800	504800	Some people, like the player characters, are very much in the walking wooded category.
504800	508800	They're still functioning, even if they're not feeling tip-top.
508800	512800	Others, however, are beginning to suffer quite badly.
512800	515800	There are one or two, in fact one in particular,
515800	522800	who we'll come to when we introduce Dr. Coombs, who is doing very badly indeed.
522800	527800	On top of all this, there are all sorts of weird stories going around the camp.
527800	530800	There are a few kids who live in the camp, and they tell odd stories
530800	535800	of how there are things going on at night,
535800	540800	that people have been seen in the camp at night who don't live there,
540800	545800	strange people, people who don't have faces.
545800	548800	But this is the kind of story that kids tell,
548800	552800	so I'm sure there's nothing to it and you have nothing to worry about.
552800	554800	You usually don't in these kind of games.
557800	562800	And I think this probably gives us a good opportunity to introduce the player characters.
562800	565800	Shall we go around in turn and just say who you're playing
565800	570800	and what has brought you to living in the shanty town?
570800	572800	Do you want to start, Zach?
572800	575800	My name is Frederick Mellon I,
575800	580800	and I've been living in this Hoover town pretty much since its inception.
580800	585800	I was a very, very bitter old man,
585800	589800	just living in the city scrounging about my way,
589800	595800	spending my time sending my fingers into another men's pockets,
595800	599800	and just trying to get by as best that I could.
599800	604800	But now, now I live in the same world as everybody else,
604800	608800	and it's nice, they've seen my side of things,
608800	611800	and I'm showing them the dark ways of the world as well.
611800	618800	So I'm here in this little Hooverville just trying to teach my fellow man how to scrape by,
618800	624800	by digging into all those around who have so, so much.
624800	628800	Because the world, it's a terrible fucking place.
628800	634800	But if you put a smile on, you just forget and forget about it,
634800	638800	then everything's gonna be okay, okay, all right, hey!
640800	641800	Perfect.
641800	644800	Can we see if Zach's character has a face?
651800	654800	I'm not entirely convinced that it's not just a mask or painted on,
654800	657800	but yeah, he has what appears to be a face.
659800	662800	So, Joe, do you want to introduce your character next?
662800	663800	Sure.
663800	665800	Say exactly what I said.
665800	666800	Yeah.
669800	671800	I'm Frederick Mellon the First.
671800	673800	Fuck, this is embarrassing.
673800	674800	I'm a burglar.
674800	675800	Shit.
678800	679800	Don't you hate it when that happens?
679800	680800	Yeah.
681800	683800	I'm Nathaniel Coombs.
683800	687800	I'm the local, I guess, doctor around here.
687800	692800	I was the head of the Bentham Hospital back in the day,
692800	699800	and then the crash hit, and I fell with it, man.
699800	701800	I ended up right there at the bottom.
701800	706800	And if things weren't bad then, I got sick, I got this thing,
706800	708800	I got this thing I just can't figure out.
708800	712800	It's making me, it's giving me blackouts.
712800	716800	I can't find the will to move around some days.
717800	721800	It's just, and everybody here, everybody seems to be getting it,
721800	723800	and I just, I can't figure it out.
723800	725800	I just, I wish I was better.
725800	727800	I wish I could just figure it out.
727800	730800	I wish I could help them all, but I just can't get it.
730800	732800	I don't know what it is.
733800	736800	I spend my day doing what I can with nothing,
736800	741800	and my old protégé, Dr. Cavendish, he comes and helps sometimes,
741800	743800	and there's, of course, Billy.
743800	746800	He keeps everybody's spirits up around here as much as he can,
746800	751800	but I just, I wish I could lick this thing.
751800	753800	I don't know what to do.
753800	754800	Nice.
754800	757800	Lethargy, blacking out?
757800	759800	Do I have this disease?
759800	761800	Oh, boy.
763800	765800	Oh, and finally.
765800	768800	Yeah, if you've been hanging around the shantytown a while,
768800	769800	you probably know me.
769800	771800	I'm Thomas Dolan.
771800	777800	My story's not too dissimilar from Nathaniel's, from Dr. Coombes.
778800	782800	I was doing good before the Depression.
782800	785800	I had worked my way out of poverty.
785800	788800	I'm a second-generation Irish immigrant,
788800	792800	and I built more than my father had before me.
792800	794800	I did it straight, unlike a lot of people in my neighborhood,
794800	796800	and things were going good.
796800	798800	I weathered the storm a little better than most.
798800	800800	I was crawling my way back up.
800800	803800	I was almost living like normal again,
803800	806800	and then, like Nathaniel, I came down.
806800	809800	I came down with this sickness,
809800	811800	and it just took everything from me.
811800	813800	It weakened me.
813800	815800	At that point, it was almost like my partner,
815800	817800	my business partner, was energized.
817800	821800	He started succeeding in everything I failed at,
821800	824800	and, well, he's got the business now,
824800	826800	and here I am sitting with all of you.
826800	831800	So, yeah, I kind of want to help the doctor here in any way I can,
831800	834800	because what's eating away at me on the inside
834800	836800	is eating away at a lot of people in this camp,
836800	838800	and it's not right.
838800	839800	Nice.
839800	843800	Well, it is a cold November morning.
843800	847800	The camp is beginning to come to life.
847800	849800	People are getting up and about
849800	852800	and performing their morning routines, such as they are.
852800	856800	There's a group of people who are out making a campfire
856800	859800	where they're going to boil up some used coffee grounds
859800	861800	and possibly some old roots that they've dug up
861800	864800	to make what passes for coffee around here.
864800	866800	There are a few people who are cooking
866800	868800	what supplies they've managed to salvage
868800	874800	or, in some cases, buy to make some breakfast.
874800	877800	And in the medical shack,
877800	882800	Dr. Coombs is busy looking after a patient.
882800	887800	For the last couple of days, you've had Harold Priestley there.
887800	894800	He is a former journalist who worked at the Crawl Examiner,
894800	899800	but he and his wife have been at the camp for some time,
899800	903800	and Harold, out of all the patients you've had here,
903800	906800	has been the worst hit with whatever this disease is.
906800	908800	This morning, you're fairly certain
908800	912800	that this is going to be his last day.
912800	916800	His breathing has been extremely labored.
916800	924800	You can hear, oh, maybe what sounds like a death rattle in his lungs,
924800	930800	but it's not quite like any death rattle you've heard before.
930800	932800	It doesn't have that wet, phlegmy sound.
932800	935800	It's a more dry, rasping rattle.
935800	940800	Which seems to correspond with all the other symptoms you've seen recently.
940800	945800	He is not just dehydrated.
945800	948800	I mean, you've had trouble getting him to retain fluids,
948800	950800	but it's more than dehydrated.
950800	953800	He's desiccated.
953800	955800	His skin is flaking.
955800	960800	And this morning, you swear a couple of the times
960800	963800	when he's had trouble breathing and coughed,
963800	967800	you've seen a little cloud of dust come out of his mouth.
967800	971800	Has Nathaniel seen other people die from this disease yet,
971800	973800	or is this the first time it's actually...
973800	975800	No.
975800	978800	Yeah, it looks like this is the first patient
978800	980800	you're going to lose to whatever this is.
980800	987800	Wow, you must feel like a real shitty doctor, Joe.
987800	990800	But at this stage, there's not really much else you can do for him
990800	992800	other than palliative care.
992800	995800	He is beyond any help.
995800	1004800	His wife has been sitting in a little chair beside him
1004800	1006800	for most of the night.
1006800	1010800	And she's fallen asleep at this stage, and the exhaustion has just got to her.
1010800	1014800	But with the noise outside, she's beginning to stir.
1014800	1016800	Her name's Agatha.
1016800	1018800	They're both actually fairly young,
1018800	1020800	though you wouldn't think of it to look at Harold at the moment.
1020800	1022800	They're both in their 30s.
1022800	1025800	But he looks like, if you didn't know otherwise,
1025800	1027800	you'd think that he was in his 60s at least,
1027800	1032800	just from the effect on his skin.
1032800	1036800	Yeah, as he goes into this latest coughing fit,
1036800	1043800	she stirs and she takes hold of his hand.
1043800	1048800	There's this sort of cracking sound,
1048800	1050800	and she jumps back in alarm,
1050800	1054800	and you can see a couple of his fingers just drop to the ground
1054800	1057800	and bounce across the floor.
1057800	1059800	Holy shit.
1059800	1063800	OK, before you've had a chance to do anything else, let's have a sand roll.
1063800	1067800	I dig it.
1067800	1071800	Start as we mean to go on.
1071800	1073800	I pass a 30 on a 40.
1073800	1075800	OK, you're a doctor.
1075800	1077800	You have seen some weird shit over the years.
1077800	1078800	Maybe not this weird.
1078800	1080800	He's got the old dropy fingers.
1080800	1085800	Yeah, he's seen lots of fingers just drop to the floor.
1085800	1089800	But yeah, you can see that his hand has actually fractured slightly,
1089800	1094800	that there's bits of bone fragment poking out through this desiccated flesh,
1094800	1097800	his hands trembling a little bit.
1097800	1099800	One of the fingers where it's dropped on the ground,
1099800	1102800	the desiccated flesh has dropped away from it a bit,
1102800	1105800	revealing bone there.
1105800	1108800	Harold Priestley himself just doesn't seem to have noticed any of this.
1108800	1111800	He's still staring up at the ceiling.
1111800	1114800	I want to lean over him, and do I have anything I can shine a light?
1114800	1116800	I want to see if he responds to light.
1116800	1118800	Harold, are you still in there?
1118800	1122800	Yeah, you don't have the proper medical equipment that you used to have,
1122800	1127800	but you've certainly got an electric flashlight that you can shine in there.
1127800	1130800	It's a bit brute force, but it's better than nothing.
1130800	1132800	And yeah, you shine that.
1132800	1135800	And not only do his eyes not respond,
1135800	1139800	but you see with all this dust that he's been coughing up,
1139800	1143800	that there is actually a thin patina of dust across his corneas
1143800	1145800	that he's not blinking off.
1145800	1147800	But he's still breathing at this point?
1147800	1148800	Yeah.
1148800	1150800	I'll check if he's breathing at this point.
1150800	1158800	Yeah, it is very, very labored, but he is breathing.
1158800	1162800	Agatha, understandably at this stage, is freaking the fuck out.
1162800	1165800	She is screaming, she is crying,
1165800	1168800	she is demanding to know what the hell is going on with her husband.
1168800	1171800	I want to try and calm her down,
1171800	1173800	but my point in calming her down is to say,
1173800	1178800	Agatha, I'm sorry to say this might be your last chance
1178800	1181800	to say anything you need to say to Harold.
1181800	1183800	He doesn't have much longer.
1183800	1187800	If you'd like to say anything, now would be the time.
1187800	1190800	Oh, God. Oh, God.
1190800	1192800	If you say so, Doctor.
1192800	1198800	And she leans over him, and she's obviously trying very gingerly
1198800	1202800	to find some way of holding onto him without damaging him further.
1202800	1206800	And you can see, I mean, as she's leaning over him,
1206800	1208800	there's tears dropping off her face,
1208800	1210800	and where they're dropping onto his skin,
1210800	1214800	they're just leaving little gouges as they run down.
1214800	1218800	Oh, wow. Holy shit.
1218800	1220800	So, while you're dealing with that situation,
1220800	1225800	let's cut outside to...
1225800	1229800	Yeah, let's go to Frederick, first of all.
1229800	1231800	So, what's Frederick's morning routine?
1231800	1235800	What does he normally do when he first gets up?
1235800	1238800	The camera kind of pans across the Hoover Town,
1238800	1241800	and you see some children playing.
1241800	1244800	You don't see Frederick Mellon the first
1244800	1251800	because he is hiding inside a half-rotted-out metal barrel
1251800	1255800	that they used to make fires for some time
1255800	1258800	until it eventually disintegrated and was no longer useful,
1258800	1260800	so it's kind of half-rolled over.
1260800	1266800	And he is inside waiting for these kids
1266800	1271800	to get just close enough for him to just pop out
1271800	1274800	and scare the shit out of them.
1274800	1278800	He's just trying to really, really give them a show.
1278800	1283800	And as soon as their eyes are massive,
1283800	1285800	he holds out a single-dollar bill.
1285800	1290800	Hey, my kiddies, kiddies, kiddies, hey, hey, hey.
1290800	1292800	The world has joy.
1292800	1295800	Joy for you, joy for me.
1295800	1298800	Okay, now, I want you to take this dollar, okay?
1298800	1300800	Mister, that's a whole dollar.
1300800	1301800	Yes, take it.
1301800	1304800	That's a whole dollar.
1304800	1305800	Yeah.
1305800	1306800	And with that...
1306800	1308800	Yeah, that's right.
1308800	1311800	With that, the three kids start fighting over the dollar
1311800	1317800	in a very spirited way.
1317800	1320800	You notice, actually, that with the group of kids,
1320800	1324800	I mean, there are kids of various ages throughout the camp,
1324800	1327800	and there's normally four of them
1327800	1329800	who travel around in this particular group.
1329800	1331800	I mean, the camp's only got about 15 people in it,
1331800	1332800	so there aren't that many kids.
1332800	1334800	But there's a group of four kids
1334800	1337800	that normally go around and do all the mischief,
1337800	1341800	and there only seem to be three of them here today.
1341800	1343800	There's one of the girls, Esther.
1343800	1345800	Hey, wait, hey, where's Benji?
1345800	1346800	It's Esther who's missing.
1346800	1347800	Oh, where's Esther?
1347800	1351800	Yeah, the other kids look up
1352800	1354800	and sort of half pay attention to what he's saying.
1354800	1356800	I always get her and Benji confused.
1356800	1358800	And then go back to fighting over the dollar
1358800	1359800	because they haven't seen the whole dollar
1359800	1361800	for a very long time.
1361800	1363800	So he kind of raises it up, and he's like,
1363800	1365800	okay, okay, I was gonna give it to you,
1365800	1367800	but now you gotta work for it
1367800	1369800	by answering me a question, all right?
1369800	1370800	Now, where is this Esther?
1370800	1372800	Where's your friend who runs around with you?
1372800	1373800	Haven't seen her yet, Mister.
1373800	1375800	Oh, you mean you haven't seen her yet?
1375800	1377800	You've been going around the town with her every day,
1377800	1380800	and now just today she's gone.
1380800	1382800	Yeah, do you like that change?
1385800	1387800	One of the little boys looks up and says,
1387800	1389800	oh, maybe she's sick, Mister.
1389800	1390800	Give us the dollar.
1390800	1393800	He looks off into the distance,
1393800	1396800	kind of coughing slightly to himself
1396800	1399800	as he just holds the dollar out and hands it to him.
1399800	1402800	A smile just grows across his face
1402800	1404800	as he watches the kids.
1404800	1406800	Yeah, well, little Benji grabs the dollar bill
1406800	1408800	out of your hand
1408800	1410800	and goes running off down the camp
1410800	1413800	with the other two kids chasing him
1413800	1416800	in, let's say, a playful manner,
1416800	1418800	but the same kind of playful manner
1418800	1421800	as you'd expect from hungry dogs.
1421800	1423800	Yeah.
1423800	1425800	He's optimistic.
1425800	1427800	Well, yeah, the way our own children
1427800	1429800	might play someday if we're lucky.
1430800	1432800	Whoa!
1436800	1440800	But the girl that you noticed was missing, Esther,
1440800	1444800	she lives with her mother,
1444800	1446800	a woman called Mrs. Frain,
1446800	1448800	who you may know as Maureen,
1448800	1451800	is in one of the tents nearby.
1453800	1457800	The mother, Mrs. Frain, is a widow.
1457800	1460800	Her husband killed himself a little while back.
1460800	1462800	She used to come from money,
1462800	1465800	and you know that she's very protective of her daughter,
1465800	1467800	but at the same time, she's been quite ill
1467800	1470800	with the disease that's going on around here.
1470800	1473800	I mean, Esther, as far as you know,
1473800	1475800	has been one of the healthier people in the camp,
1475800	1478800	and it's really unusual not to see her up and about.
1478800	1481800	I mean, her mother's been bedridden for a little while,
1481800	1484800	but Esther definitely should be up and about at this stage.
1484800	1489800	Frederick Mellon I will go check in just to say hello.
1489800	1492800	Kind of, he's curious, so he's just going to kind of poke around
1492800	1493800	where his nose shouldn't be.
1493800	1495800	Well, you go over to the tent,
1495800	1499800	and the flap on the tent is open slightly.
1499800	1502800	They never see me coming in.
1502800	1504800	I'm very stealthy.
1504800	1506800	So Luke can't make it to one game,
1506800	1508800	and you're like, we need a monster.
1509800	1513800	I am playing a nice, optimistic,
1513800	1521800	old man who joyfully slinks and creeps through the shadows
1521800	1524800	and pits children against each other.
1529800	1532800	He's practically a Disney character.
1536800	1540800	I've been watching, and I enjoy the way Luke plays a game.
1543800	1547800	Have you watched the way it affects the other players?
1550800	1553800	Well, I'm currently progressing the story.
1553800	1555800	Thank you, Tommy.
1555800	1557800	That's true.
1557800	1562800	So, yes, you take a look inside the tent,
1562800	1569800	and in there you can see that there are two cots that have been set up.
1570800	1571800	Well, I say cots.
1571800	1573800	I mean, they're fairly makeshift things
1573800	1578800	that have been cobbled together out of spare wood and whatever cloth
1578800	1581800	and, in some cases, newspaper they've managed to get hold of.
1581800	1583800	But let's call them cots.
1583800	1586800	And one of them is empty.
1586800	1589800	In fact, it looks almost undisturbed.
1589800	1594800	The other one has got Maureen Frayn lying in it.
1594800	1598800	And you're not sure whether she's alive or dead.
1598800	1603800	She is, at the very least, badly injured.
1603800	1606800	There is blood down her face,
1606800	1609800	and it looks like someone has bludgeoned her.
1609800	1612800	There's blood splattered all over her sheets.
1612800	1616800	And, yeah, she does not look in a good way.
1616800	1622800	Frederick Mellon is frozen in the doorway when he sees this,
1622800	1625800	unable to decide what to do.
1625800	1630800	He is just going to give the room a quick once-over
1630800	1637800	to decide, A, if there is any, like, fight put up,
1637800	1642800	any sort of distress actions happening in this room,
1642800	1646800	and B, to see if anyone other than her body is still in here.
1646800	1649800	Okay, I mean, this is a comparatively small tent,
1649800	1652800	so it would be very difficult for someone to be hiding in here
1652800	1654800	and for you not to see them.
1654800	1659800	But as far as trying to discern the details of what happened goes,
1659800	1662800	let's have a spot hidden role.
1662800	1665800	This seems like the perfect opportunity for a spot hidden role.
1665800	1667800	16 on a 55.
1667800	1670800	Okay, yeah, that's a hard success.
1670800	1673800	So, yeah, you notice a few things then.
1673800	1677800	As far as the state of Maureen is concerned,
1677800	1680800	you reckon, for a start, that she's still alive.
1680800	1684800	You can see her chest rising and falling slightly,
1684800	1689800	but there's, like I say, a fairly nasty head wound.
1689800	1693800	The other things you clock are that Esther's bed,
1693800	1696800	like I say, I mean, seems to be largely unmade,
1696800	1702800	but perhaps more unusually, the thick winter coat that she had
1702800	1706800	that is obviously fairly vital at this time of year
1706800	1710800	is still there beside her bed, as are her shoes.
1710800	1716800	So, you know, if she is up and about or outside the tent,
1716800	1721800	on a cold November morning like this without her coat and shoes,
1721800	1723800	that's not going to be good for her.
1723800	1727800	The other thing you notice, seeing as you've got a hard success,
1727800	1733800	is there is something tucked underneath Maureen Frayn's bed,
1733800	1739800	and it's wrapped up in cloth, but it must have been disturbed
1739800	1742800	when whatever happened last night happened,
1742800	1747800	and you can see that she does have what looks like a fairly nice,
1747800	1751800	a very expensive-looking shotgun tucked under her bed.
1751800	1755800	Yeah, he's going to leave that be.
1755800	1760800	See, Thomas? Not necessarily playing the exact same way
1760800	1763800	as one Luke might.
1763800	1767800	No, no, I was just saying you're playing a character who's a dickhead.
1767800	1770800	Oh, he's so nice, though. You'll get to know him.
1770800	1771800	You'll get to know him. It'll be fine.
1771800	1774800	Definitely should have grabbed the shotgun just now.
1776800	1779800	He is going to just kind of slink back out
1779800	1784800	and walk quickly toward the doctor's abode.
1784800	1787800	Okay, yeah, yes, the medical shack that he's...
1787800	1788800	Wherever he might be working.
1788800	1791800	There is a shack that Dr. Coombs has set up.
1791800	1794800	It's not where he lives. He lives in a tent just next to it,
1794800	1801800	but he's got a shack which serves as, I guess, a sort of field hospital
1801800	1804800	that has got a couple of cots in it
1804800	1807800	and has got what equipment he's managed to salvage
1807800	1813800	or get from various sources, what medical equipment and drugs and so on.
1813800	1816800	And so, yeah, you can make your way over there.
1816800	1820800	Before we deal with that, however, let's check in with Mr. Dolan.
1820800	1822800	Thomas Dolan, how you doing?
1822800	1827800	What's Thomas Dolan's morning routine?
1827800	1829800	Is he up and about at this time?
1829800	1831800	In his old life, he would have been,
1831800	1835800	but he's tired in the mornings a lot of times,
1835800	1842800	so he might be just dragging himself out of his shack right about this time
1842800	1846800	and seeing if anybody around the campfires has some extra coffee.
1846800	1852800	Okay, yeah. I mean, the campfire is pretty much outside your shack,
1852800	1854800	and you make your way over there,
1854800	1857800	and there are only a couple of people sitting there.
1857800	1865800	There's Dr. Rothstein, who you know was some kind of university lecturer,
1865800	1867800	who's sitting there, warming his hands.
1867800	1869800	He's making the coffee at the moment.
1869800	1874800	And also sitting opposite him is a young woman who you know.
1874800	1877800	Her name is Nancy, Nancy Carver.
1877800	1885800	And she worked in a lawyer's office, you think, before everything went south.
1885800	1892800	And she is sitting there with an absolutely vacant look in her eyes.
1892800	1894800	She's just looking at the flames,
1894800	1901800	and you can see that there is actually, in the back of her hair and on her coat,
1901800	1903800	there are some ice crystals there
1903800	1907800	that suggest that she might actually have been sitting there all night.
1907800	1912800	Nance, are you all right there? Nance?
1912800	1920800	She doesn't look at you, but she starts just twitching a little bit.
1921800	1927800	Her eyes just go a bit wider, and she looks at the fire more,
1927800	1933800	and then she forces herself to look up and looks over at you.
1933800	1936800	What happened? Why is it light?
1936800	1941800	Where am I? Where am I? Where am I?
1941800	1943800	You're in the Hooverville, Nance. You're around the fire.
1943800	1946800	There's me, Thomas Dolan, and there's Rothstein right there.
1946800	1948800	What do you think you are?
1948800	1952800	Rothstein looks up and just sort of grunts and then goes back to making the coffee.
1952800	1957800	I was here. I was here. I was here last night.
1957800	1962800	Why can't I remember? Why can't I remember, Thomas?
1962800	1965800	Why can't I remember? What do they do to me?
1965800	1967800	Who? Who, Nance? Who did what to you?
1967800	1971800	I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
1971800	1976800	They were here last night. They did something, Thomas.
1976800	1977800	They did something, Thomas.
1977800	1978800	Those little fucking urchins.
1978800	1982800	I don't know. Are they? Oh, God.
1982800	1986800	I didn't have faces. I didn't have faces.
1986800	1990800	Rothstein, are you hearing what she's saying?
1990800	1992800	Has she been like this all morning?
1992800	1994800	Oh, yes. Yeah, she's been like this all morning.
1994800	1998800	She just taps the side of his head and then goes back to making the coffee.
1998800	2002800	Can I do a, I was going to say a psychology check, but I don't know if that would.
2002800	2007800	Do I, this, I mean, it sounds fantastical. Do I believe her?
2007800	2011800	Oh, I see. Yeah, that would be psychology, definitely. Yeah.
2011800	2014800	No, 76 on a, I think it's a 40.
2014800	2020800	Okay. I mean, yeah, she is obviously upset.
2020800	2026800	I mean, even without the role, I mean, it seems unlikely that she'd be lying about something like this.
2026800	2028800	I mean, she seems genuinely upset, but.
2028800	2032800	Yeah, but it's the 30s, so we don't believe victims yet.
2032800	2035800	There is that.
2035800	2039800	Shit, fucking Rothstein, she's been like this all fucking morning and you've just been sitting here making coffee?
2039800	2042800	Look at this, there's ice all over the back of her fucking head.
2042800	2044800	I've just been here 10 minutes. I'm making the coffee.
2044800	2048800	I went and got, I got some roots. I added them to the coffee.
2048800	2051800	You know, the grounds are, grounds are all moldy today.
2051800	2053800	Grounds are all moldy.
2053800	2059800	All right, Rothstein, I go and I grab a blanket to put around her, around her back where all the ice is.
2059800	2064800	And yeah, she's, she's muttering, she's muttering something about a puppet now.
2064800	2069800	Do I, do I know anything about her, her life? Does she have any puppets?
2069800	2071800	Was she in vaudeville?
2071800	2073800	No, no, like I say, she works in the lawyer's office.
2073800	2078800	Nance, what do you, what do you mean puppets? What are you talking about? These fucking puppets?
2078800	2086800	They had a puppet. Yeah, it was a puppet, wasn't it? They had a puppet last night.
2086800	2094800	And my God, Thomas, they made it sing. And she just bursts into floods of tears.
2094800	2098800	At this point, I feel like I'm convinced she's talking about a vaudeville show.
2098800	2107800	It's like, all right, well, Nance is off a rocker. I don't know if that's, you know, so out of character.
2107800	2108800	It is, actually.
2108800	2112800	Well, these are hard times. Everybody gets a little weird.
2112800	2113800	Oh, yeah.
2113800	2121800	Dolan is definitely confused by this, but I don't think he clocks it as, as supernatural or anything.
2121800	2123800	It just seems like a drunk woman in the depression.
2123800	2126800	Yeah, that seems entirely reasonable.
2126800	2136800	And at this point, you see Mellon walking past you, would it be fair to say with purposeful stride, heading towards the medical tent?
2136800	2142800	Rarely. Is he purposeful? So in this moment, it seems strange.
2142800	2144800	Freddie, where are you going?
2144800	2151800	I gotta go say hi to Dr. Combs. Maureen got hit on the head.
2151800	2155800	Maureen got hit on the head. I think Nance might have got hit on the head, too. She's being fucking wacky.
2155800	2156800	Why don't I...
2156800	2158800	Take her or leave her. Let's go tell him.
2158800	2160800	Let's walk her on down there.
2160800	2171800	So Mellon will kind of bow very deeply and tip his cap to the woman that Dolan is helping up.
2171800	2176800	And then we'll try to hold her arm up on the other side to help her walk.
2176800	2178800	And we skip away.
2179800	2193800	And you lead her into the medical shack where you can see Agatha Priestley leaning over the very badly ill-looking form of her husband.
2193800	2203800	You can see what appear to be a couple of fingers lying on the ground. The side of Priestley's face is melting slightly.
2203800	2210800	There is a death rattle coming from his lungs. And what's Dr. Combs doing while all this is happening?
2210800	2216800	If he sees them walk in, he would like to try and create a privacy barrier if there's a curtain or something I can draw.
2216800	2217800	Yeah, sure.
2217800	2222800	To try and pull that closed and meet them past the curtain. Give Agatha and Harold privacy.
2222800	2223800	Okay.
2223800	2228800	Thomas Dolan even is just looking at the fingers that are peeking out under the privacy curtain.
2228800	2231800	Yes. They're hard to miss.
2233800	2237800	Gentlemen, how can I help you? I'm in the middle of something back here.
2237800	2239800	Doc, are those his fucking fingers?
2239800	2242800	He turns around and looks and sees that they're pretty clearly visible.
2244800	2246800	The curtain hangs like a foot off the ground.
2246800	2262800	Yeah, those are his face. He's not long for this world. Let's give them some privacy and I'll try and usher them a little further away from that area.
2262800	2264800	What's going on here, guys?
2264800	2269800	Well, Nancy's gone wackadoodle and Freddie says, what'd you see, Freddie?
2269800	2279800	Yeah, well, I was just saying that, you know, my pals, my pallys, they were hopping about around the camp and Esther wasn't with them.
2279800	2288800	So I went to see if she was home with Maureen and turns out Maureen, big old gash on her head.
2288800	2293800	You know, so definitely needs to be checked out for sure. But, you know, not awake maybe.
2293800	2296800	Was she, she was still alive when you saw her, though?
2296800	2298800	I think her chest was moving with breath.
2299800	2307800	Nathaniel's going to start gathering up a doctor's bag. And Nance, why are you here? Are you feeling all right?
2307800	2310800	The short answer is no, doctor.
2310800	2312800	They made it sing.
2312800	2314800	They made what sing, Nance?
2314800	2318800	Doc, maybe you ought to put that puppet behind you out of view.
2322800	2324800	I think that thing's going to freak her out.
2325800	2327800	Little Gregory? What's the problem with Little Gregory?
2327800	2332800	Well, I mean, we can see the fingers under the curtain and then Little Gregory's just staring right at her.
2332800	2337800	And she's had a fairly traumatic puppet-related experience in the past.
2337800	2341800	And also, just having a puppet of Rasputin seems very strange.
2343800	2346800	It's a little old-fashioned at this point.
2347800	2351800	Nathaniel grabs a little towel and throws it over Little Gregory.
2351800	2355800	All right, Nance, let's get you warmed up. Let's have you get over here by this fire.
2355800	2361800	And he goes and grabs an unused blanket to wrap around her and gets her right up close to the fire.
2361800	2364800	Is my little buddy Billy in the tent right now?
2364800	2366800	No, he hasn't turned up yet this morning.
2366800	2368800	Is that your other puppet?
2372800	2379800	Is there anybody in the medical tent that I could, like, leave to keep an eye on things here if I left?
2379800	2389800	No, it would just be Agatha, Harold, and, well, Nancy. So, just patience and, well, and Agatha.
2389800	2396800	I'm going to pop my head into the privacy curtain and tell Agatha, Agatha, I gotta run out for a second.
2396800	2400800	It sounds like somebody's hurt. I'll be back as soon as I can.
2400800	2408800	If anything happens, you can come and find me. I'm going to be over at Maureen's place.
2408800	2412800	Nancy's sitting in here. She's going to warm up a little bit. I'll be back as soon as I can.
2412800	2416800	Yeah, she doesn't seem to have noticed a single word you said.
2416800	2425800	Okay. And then, yeah, just set up my sign that's like the doctor will be back in five minutes or whatever, ten minutes.
2425800	2433800	And I'll let the guys lead me to, or whoever wants to go with me, lead me to Maureen's tent.
2433800	2439800	With my doctor's bed, whatever I can, whatever I have that I would take to a little field call.
2439800	2446800	Call it a hunch, but I think we should maybe stick together from this point on out.
2446800	2458800	Frederick Mellon will lead you guys into the tent and as he walks in, he's going to kind of push the gun more out of sight with his foot.
2459800	2468800	As he kind of lays his hand about to show off the body of Maureen and be like,
2468800	2475800	look, this is exactly how I found her and look over there, points at the jacket and the shoes of Esther.
2475800	2484800	I have no words. I mean, Esther doesn't have another pair of shoes. She doesn't have another coat.
2484800	2486800	That is the most alarming thing about this site.
2486800	2488800	Where is she though? Thomas.
2488800	2490800	Thomas Dolan is crossing himself.
2490800	2497800	Nathaniel looks over to Thomas and says, you didn't happen to see Esther on your way to get me this morning, did you?
2497800	2498800	I surely did not.
2498800	2502800	And then he's going to, yeah, Nathaniel is going to start doctoring Maureen.
2502800	2503800	Okay.
2503800	2508800	Trying to stabilize her and see if I can tell what happened and all that kind of stuff.
2508800	2510800	Yeah, give me a first aid roll then.
2511800	2516800	That's a pass of 45 on a 70.
2516800	2522800	Okay. So, yeah, you can stabilize her. She is going to need proper medical attention.
2522800	2527800	She has taken a very nasty head wound. At the very least, she's got a concussion.
2527800	2533800	She's drifting in and out of consciousness and she's not really with it at the moment.
2534800	2541800	Ideally, she should be in the hospital, but you know the hospital will take her.
2541800	2552800	But at the very least, you reckon you're going to have to take her back to the shack and try to get her into some kind of decent condition.
2552800	2560800	Maureen, can you hear me? Can you walk? Are you able to walk? You're taking a nasty blow to the head here. We need to get to my tent.
2560800	2566800	She just groans and then says, Esther, where's Esther?
2566800	2571800	We don't know, Maureen. Have you seen her? When's the last time you saw her?
2571800	2586800	No, no. I don't know. I woke up last night and there were men in the tent and, oh God, she puts her hand up towards her head.
2586800	2588800	Did you recognize these men, Maureen?
2588800	2595800	No, no. And she reaches her hand up towards her head and then just passes out again.
2595800	2600800	I turn to Frederick and Thomas. I'm going to need to get her back to the medical tent.
2600800	2603800	Help me carry her back to the tent, Mr. Mellon.
2603800	2604800	Done.
2604800	2612800	When you get there, Agatha is sitting back down in the chair and she's in floods of tears.
2612800	2618800	I peek behind the curtain to see, is Harold still with us?
2618800	2634800	Yeah, you take a look and you can check his life signs, I guess. If you'd listen with a stethoscope, there's no breathing, there's no heartbeat.
2634800	2642800	You'd listen for a few moments just to make sure. There's definitely no heartbeat.
2642800	2650800	And then as you listen, you hear a sort of scratching sound.
2650800	2658800	I listen more intently, trying to locate where that scratching sound's coming from.
2658800	2666800	Yeah, you move the stethoscope down a little bit, and as you move it down towards the abdomen, the scratching gets louder.
2666800	2671800	Medical training never trained me for inner scratching. Hang on one second.
2671800	2673800	What is a ringtone?
2673800	2675800	It's Joe's doorbell.
2675800	2677800	Oh.
2677800	2684800	Sure thing, give me one second. Oh, can you just leave it at the stoop there? Thank you very much.
2684800	2685800	Sorry about that.
2685800	2686800	Who's coming by?
2686800	2693800	It was a package. I don't know. That's never happened to me before. They don't ever ring my bell to deliver me a package.
2693800	2695800	Do you need to go and pick it up?
2695800	2696800	No, I'm good for now.
2696800	2699800	Are you sure? What if it's really cool?
2699800	2704800	Yeah, I'll go get it. I think it might be dice, actually.
2704800	2709800	Oh shit, go get him and I'll go to the bathroom real quick. You go get your dice.
2709800	2711800	All right, I'll run down real quick.
2711800	2712800	Let's get him.
2712800	2715800	This is so spooky.
2715800	2717800	Good, good, good, good.
2717800	2718800	Yeah, this is excellent.
2718800	2719800	Oh, glad you're enjoying it.
2719800	2720800	I really am.
2720800	2723800	We were in a very heated moment before my bell rang.
2723800	2729800	I was hearing a scratching and scratching from inside a thing I should not be hearing a scratching and scratching coming from.
2729800	2733800	Scratching and a scratching.
2733800	2737800	Moving down the abdomen.
2737800	2748800	So, yes, as you move the stethoscope down the abdomen, that sound of scratching gets louder and more distinct.
2748800	2751800	Not knowing anything about scratching and scratching coming from inside the body.
2751800	2758800	He's going to look for external sources and maybe like under the bed and see if that's if there's something underneath there or something.
2758800	2761800	No, no, of course not.
2761800	2763800	It's coming from inside the body.
2763800	2764800	It definitely is.
2764800	2768800	The call is coming from inside the body.
2768800	2772800	Can I see any like protrusion or anything like any from the outside?
2772800	2775800	No, no, you can't.
2775800	2785800	One of the side effects really of this desiccation of Priestly's flesh is that even prodding it and poking it.
2785800	2787800	Yeah, there's no elasticity.
2787800	2788800	It's quite rigid now.
2788800	2792800	I'm going to try and tell Agatha to leave the room.
2792800	2794800	She's in this room with us, right?
2794800	2795800	Oh, absolutely.
2795800	2796800	Yeah. Yeah.
2796800	2802800	She's sitting down in a chair, but behind the privacy barrier that you've erected.
2802800	2806800	And so she's on the same side as you and the body at the moment.
2806800	2811800	Agatha, if you could step out of the room, please.
2811800	2815800	I'll make sure that Harold here is cared for.
2815800	2819800	We'll arrange funeral arrangements together here in just a bit.
2819800	2821800	Just step outside that curtain there for me.
2821800	2825800	Freddie, could you see the widow Priestly out?
2825800	2827800	I mean, Mrs. Priestly?
2827800	2829800	I am Mrs. Priestly.
2829800	2833800	Agatha does not seem to be aware of anything that's going on around her at the moment.
2833800	2835800	She has shut down completely.
2835800	2836800	Does she...
2836800	2837800	This is kind of...
2837800	2838800	I should have asked this a long time ago.
2838800	2843800	Is she terribly affected by this disease also or is she kind of doing okay?
2843800	2847800	She's affected by it, but nowhere near as badly as her husband was.
2847800	2848800	Right. Okay.
2848800	2852800	Yeah, fellas, if you could try to get her out of here.
2852800	2856800	Yeah, let's take Mrs. Priestly out of here.
2856800	2861800	And I grab one arm and wait for Mr. Mellon to grab the other.
2861800	2863800	We're getting pretty good at this, yeah?
2863800	2864800	Yeah.
2864800	2869800	We could maybe pull off, you know, some kind of weekend-up-and-nod situation after this.
2869800	2885800	When they get her out of the room, my doctor's curiosity is going to grab a scalpel and see if I can find out what's going on with that scrichin inside there.
2885800	2898800	So, yeah, you sort of hitch up his pajama top and you can isolate, using the stethoscope, the area where the scratching is coming from.
2898800	2908800	Now, when it comes to cutting into the area, because of the desiccated nature of the flesh, it's not like cutting into flesh normally is.
2908800	2911800	It's cracking and crumbling as you're doing so.
2911800	2924800	Yeah, there's no blood, there's no fluid coming out, and there's just chunks of what was his abdominal wall falling away.
2924800	2931800	And inside you catch sight, first of all, of something colorful.
2931800	2944800	I mean, you think perhaps initially it's one of his internal organs because it is sort of glistening and iridescent, but no, it's not that.
2944800	2948800	And there's another one, another one, these little round things.
2949800	2958800	And then in amongst this clutch of these little iridescent round objects, you can see something wriggling.
2958800	2970800	Something, I mean, it's only a couple of inches long, but it's sort of cucumber shaped, but there are little barbs or spikes coming off it.
2970800	2983800	And it lifts its front end up towards you and the whole thing irises out, and you can see this sort of mouth with all these little sharp teeth.
2983800	2988800	And suddenly this sound that sounds an awful lot like a baby crying coming from it.
2989800	2991800	Let's have a sound roll.
2991800	2993800	No!
2994800	2996800	What?
2999800	3001800	No, Scott, what?
3001800	3006800	That's a good old fashioned fail on that sound roll, baby. 64 on a 40.
3008800	3014800	OK, so I'll roll you a sand loss here because I enjoy this.
3014800	3030800	So you only lose three points of sand, but I think as an involuntary action, you stagger back and just, you can't help yourself.
3030800	3039800	You stagger back and unconsciously just try to support yourself by grabbing onto the nearest thing you can, which unfortunately is the privacy curtain that you set up.
3039800	3044800	And as you put your weight on it, you just crack the pole that it was on. The whole thing comes down.
3044800	3052800	As you land down heavily on the ground, crushing one of the fingers beneath you as you do so.
3052800	3057800	And the rest of you from outside can hear this cracking wood sound.
3058800	3071800	And then a moment later from the other side of the privacy curtain, the sound of Nancy Carver screaming as she can see the things wriggling around inside the remains of Harold Priestley's abdomen.
3071800	3084800	Oh, shit. I mean, Nathaniel's going to try his hardest to regain composure and get people out away from that crazy, scary stuff, like ushering people out of the tent.
3085800	3088800	Nancy has had such a bad 24 hours.
3093800	3100800	Okay. So, yeah, it doesn't take a lot to convince Nancy to get out of the medical shack at this stage.
3100800	3102800	Oh, fuck.
3102800	3104800	Where's Maureen? We brought her in.
3104800	3108800	Yeah. Have we successfully gotten her out the door?
3108800	3114800	Yes. Well, no, no. It was Agatha you took out. I assume Maureen is lying down on the other cot at the moment.
3116800	3118800	It's too late for you!
3120800	3123800	Mercifully, at this stage, Maureen seems to be unconscious.
3123800	3127800	Are the wriggling things moving anywhere or are they just staying inside the body cavity?
3127800	3131800	Well, there's one wriggling thing and it's clutch.
3131800	3144800	Well, looking around inside, yeah, it's not crawling out of the abdomen yet. It's not moving particularly fast.
3144800	3153800	And you can see the ruptured remains of one of these, what you realize are now eggs, which seems to be what this has come out of.
3153800	3160800	And as you're looking around at the other sort of iridescent shapes there, you can see dark shapes moving around within those.
3160800	3171800	Oh, no. How big are your boots? Start stomping.
3171800	3185800	Yeah, I could like tip him over, I guess. Yeah, I want to try that. I want to try and tip him over onto his front so that those things are kind of captured in his body cavity. They can't get out.
3185800	3200800	You start trying to tip him a bit and almost immediately you can hear the cracks and crunches from his desiccated flesh.
3200800	3207800	You tip him up slightly and his right arm just breaks off and lands on the ground.
3207800	3209800	Fingers scattering everywhere.
3209800	3221800	Oh, shoot. I'm going to yell out for Frederick and Dolan.
3221800	3227800	Because why should you be the only one to lose that?
3227800	3233800	That is the true motto of the Call of Cthulhu player.
3234800	3240800	Fellas, I need help in here. We have a problem. I need help. I need help.
3240800	3243800	Oh, yeah. Let's go help the duck.
3243800	3250800	We both promptly drop Agatha Priestly on the ground.
3250800	3253800	Sorry. Sounds like an emergency.
3253800	3258800	There is an apple crate you can sit her down on if you want to be more gentlemanly about the whole thing.
3258800	3267800	No time. The duck sound panicked.
3267800	3272800	Hurriedly walk her over, sit her down, jump cut.
3272800	3276800	Yeah. It's us bursting through the door. What's up, duck?
3276800	3283800	Got it. There's some sort of parasite here and it's nothing like I've ever seen before, but we got to keep it contained. We can't let it get into the community.
3284800	3288800	Like worms. All the kids here got worms. I got worms.
3288800	3289800	You have a basement?
3289800	3297800	Nathaniel wide-eyed is saying, yeah, worms. Sure, worms is it. Yeah, something like it.
3297800	3303800	Freddy, it looks like from the doctor's eyes, these are bad worms. Not just regular worms.
3303800	3307800	All right, duck. What can we do? What can we do to help the community?
3307800	3320800	Do we, do I, does Nathaniel know, how do we have, have we disposed of other kinds of bodies or things here before? Is there a, is there a, is there a crematorium or a place that we can burn a body or something? Destroy a body?
3320800	3332800	There is no, not destroy a body. There's a potter's field in Crawley for paupers burials where when people have died at the camp before they've been buried there.
3332800	3339800	Probably just crawling with aliens.
3339800	3352800	But yeah, I mean, if it comes to safely disposing of what you'd consider perhaps to be a biohazard, the only facility you know of to do that is the, the incinerator at the hospital.
3352800	3358800	So doc, do you think we got to get this whole guy incinerated or just these worms?
3358800	3368800	I kind of investigate the body, but I, but Joe thinks just the, just the eggs and the, but I don't know what a doctor would say if maybe they've taken root elsewhere in the body.
3368800	3375800	It just looks like he's really fallen apart. Maybe we can stick them all in a bag.
3375800	3381800	I thought Agatha was in pieces.
3381800	3388800	We just, uh, we've, we've, we've got to, we've got to get these. It looks like, it looks like eggs of some kind. We just got to, we got to destroy these somehow.
3388800	3392800	And, uh, and look out for that, that one. It's got teeth.
3392800	3393800	Which one?
3393800	3398800	And he's, he's pointing to the one that's still, I think, warming around in the body cavity.
3398800	3404800	Yeah. And as you point that out to the others, that's a good opportunity for both of you to make sand rolls.
3404800	3408800	Come with me.
3408800	3410800	Ooh, 32 on a 40.
3410800	3415800	Yeah, 15 on a 75. Thomas Dolan crosses himself and it works.
3415800	3421800	Okay. So neither of you lose any sand. You're both reacting to this much better than the doctor did.
3421800	3422800	Gross.
3422800	3429800	Yeah, it's real gnarly doc, but, uh, like I said, all the kids poop poop shit about that gnarly every other day around here.
3429800	3432800	So the world is disgusting.
3432800	3445800	Uh, so yeah, Nathaniel's going to start trying to find maybe a, like a bag that he would use for like biohazard type stuff, uh, in trails or whatever, a way to dispose and start trying to shove.
3445800	3446800	I don't know. I mean,
3446800	3450800	No, Thomas Dolan just passes you his, uh, his hobo bindle.
3450800	3460800	Nathaniel's kind of scared of the, not kind of very scared of the thing with teeth. So like, is there a way that I can scoop these eggs carefully? Does it, does it seem aggressive if I get near it?
3460800	3471800	Aggressive. I mean, it's difficult to tell. I mean, it's not moving that fast, but you know, as you examine it, it certainly seems to take an interest in you in return.
3471800	3482800	I'm going to, I'm going to try and just pick, pick eggs quickly as if, as if, I don't know, like, uh, if I was trying to grab something from behind a spider, I'm trying to just really quickly grab things and get my fingers away from it.
3482800	3484800	You know, like a spider's gold.
3484800	3504800	While you don't have a lot of medical equipment here, I mean, it is fair to say that you probably got something like tweezers and forceps and stuff like that you can use so you don't, so you don't have to use your bare hands.
3504800	3505800	Sure.
3505800	3507800	More like a scalpel to stab the little fucker.
3507800	3518800	I don't, I don't know if I'm murderous of it yet. I think there's still a part of me that's wondering about this could be the key to solving whatever this parasite I now think is a parasite in the community is.
3518800	3526800	And if you wanted to keep the samples, I mean, you've got your Mason jars and stuff like that. So you could, you could certainly keep them.
3526800	3528800	Let's do that. Let's do a Mason jar.
3528800	3551800	So as Frederick Mellon, the first and Thomas Dolan are like, I'm picturing us kind of on opposite sides, walking in circling it with, uh, with our, with our knapsacks combs is quickly darting his fingers in trying to grab it, uh, and then decides in that split second to, to collect.
3551800	3555800	And so we'll kind of back off or help you with the Mason jars.
3555800	3562800	Yeah. So I mean, yeah, between using forceps and a Mason jar, you can gather up the specimens without any real risk.
3562800	3581800	And yeah, I mean, without fully dissecting or demolishing the remains of, uh, of Mr. Priestly, there's no real way of telling whether you've got all the eggs, but you've certainly got a fair number of them.
3581800	3586800	You've got about a half dozen plus this hatch specimen. Gross.
3586800	3596800	I hold up the jar to the guys. Fellas, this, this, this, uh, this could be the key. This could be, this could be what it is. This could be the thing that is afflicting us all.
3596800	3604800	You're saying that's what's inside of me right now? That's why I feel like shit and I lost my business? Is that little fucker right there?
3604800	3607800	It's, it's now, it's now my newest theory. Yeah.
3607800	3609800	Can I squash it?
3609800	3618800	And I don't, I don't know. I need to run some tests. I need to, I need to know if there's a way to make these not be.
3618800	3624800	All right, doc. Well, as sure as, as soon as you're sure of that, just let me know when I can squash that.
3624800	3636800	OK, so, yeah, I mean, you put the jar down and at the same time, obviously, you know, Maureen Frayn is drifting in and out of consciousness.
3636800	3646800	You've got Agatha Priestly, who's outside, who is now just wandering around, just trying to get her bearings.
3646800	3651800	You've got Nancy Carver, who is still in some kind of fugue state.
3651800	3661800	But yeah, as I mentioned before, I mean, there's also perhaps the, the dawning awareness that you have not seen Billy Spitzer this morning at all.
3661800	3663800	Where, where, where's, where's Billy?
3663800	3667800	I could, I could use, I could use help here today of all days.
3667800	3671800	Frederick, Dolan, have you, you guys, you guys seen Billy today?
3671800	3675800	Uh, no, a lot of people, uh, nobody's seen around the camp today, so.
3675800	3679800	He might be with, with Esther, perhaps. Where, where would they have gone?
3679800	3681800	Do you want me to go check his tent or?
3681800	3683800	Yeah, yeah, let's do that, let's see, let's.
3683800	3697800	Wherever they must, well, I, if Esther didn't need shoes or a coat, then if we get there and Billy's shoes and coat are also there, then we know they're together, right?
3697800	3707800	I'm not a doctor, I'm not a fucking Sherlock Holmes. I'm a successful textile industrialist. I'll defer to the experts.
3707800	3718800	If, uh, if, if, if Billy's, if Billy's at home, then this is, he'll be able to come over here, help me out. We can make some headway here.
3718800	3724800	Yeah, like I said, I'm not a fucking detective, but it seems like going to Billy's house would be a really good first step.
3724800	3727800	Let's go, yeah, let's, let's go, let's go check on Billy.
3727800	3743800	Okay, yeah, you go over to Billy's tent and, again, it looks like there's been a struggle. There's no blood here, but, you know, the insides of it look like it's been ransacked and there's no sign of Billy.
3744800	3759800	Mellon is, like, very perplexed and is just eyeing everything in this tent, trying to figure out what went down, seeing if there's anything out of place, looking for any, any sort of evidence that might lead us to discover who had been here.
3759800	3763800	Okay, you will give me a spot hidden role, then.
3763800	3768800	Uh, that would be a 97.
3768800	3772800	That sounds good. It's high.
3772800	3788800	At least because your spot hidden's pretty good, that's not a fumble, but you are just blundering around at the moment. You could, you could, if you want, find some way of pushing the role.
3788800	3799800	So then, Mellon reaches into his coat and puts on his glasses?
3799800	3803800	Okay. Yeah.
3803800	3805800	Is that a way to push a role?
3805800	3809800	Yeah, I think so. And yeah, I think if you fail here, you, you end up scoring.
3809800	3815800	Can we just say I was playing my character at 40% before this?
3815800	3820800	What happens? How, how would a push role fail in this scenario with what, with glasses?
3820800	3830800	Well, it wouldn't be that directly. I think, I think that you would, actually, yeah, I'd be up for the, for you just breaking your glasses.
3830800	3832800	Take them out and they're cracked.
3832800	3833800	Yeah.
3833800	3839800	Yeah, that's a, that's a fail. That's a 73 on a 55.
3839800	3849800	You shouldn't have spent so much time hiding in burn barrels trying to scare children.
3850800	3864800	Then, yeah, you pull your glasses out and it looks like, it looks like you slept on them last night. And as you pull them out, you know, the one good lens on there just falls out and lands on the ground.
3864800	3873800	Frederick Mellon I falls to his knees as one of the former relics of, of, of his, his time on top.
3873800	3875800	Oh, is that your little artifact?
3875800	3890800	It comes to be as, as he, and he sees, he sees in the, in the broken shards of glass, the reflections of his days gone by when he could burgle people all over the city and not feel any remorse.
3890800	3898800	But now he can burgle so few because there are only so few who actually have anything to burgle.
3899800	3914800	Seeing this very human moment, Thomas Dolan takes out his grandfather's fiddle and plays, plays a mournful tune, but I'm pretty sure he only has 30 in fiddling.
3914800	3918800	So let's see how well he does.
3918800	3920800	It's an 11.
3920800	3924800	He plays a legitimately mournful tune.
3924800	3939800	Oh, and not something that sounds sarcastic.
3939800	3952800	Nathaniel doesn't have great investigation skills, but could he maybe take track? Is there, is there any kind of blood spatters? Can I maybe get a feel of maybe a direction that the scuffle took place heading toward?
3952800	3958800	Yeah, sure. Yeah. I mean, I, I, either spot hidden or track would help there.
3958800	3962800	I'm going to do a spot hidden.
3962800	3966800	I hit it. I don't know how that works in this game. I hit, it's 25 on a 25.
3966800	3969800	Okay. That's fine. That's good.
3969800	3988800	So yeah, there's nothing that you can spot within the tent itself, but looking around, you can see that, yeah, there does seem to be a bit of a scuffle and certainly drag marks in the now frozen mud outside that indicate that Billy was dragged out of the tent.
3989800	3997800	I point that out to my compatriots here. It looks like a, it looks like they went this direction, which I think we should, I think we should see where it leads.
3997800	4008800	Wipes a single tear away from his eye, turns around, stands up, gets back down, stands back up.
4008800	4017800	Thomas Dolan realizes this old fucker needs help and he helps him get up off the ground.
4017800	4030800	Thank you. Oh, I really appreciate that. That's, that's really nice. You're such a wise guy. You're just emotionally intelligent.
4030800	4036800	Thomas Dolan plays a brief song of thanks.
4036800	4046800	Oh God, your party's got a bard now, hasn't it?
4046800	4049800	Yeah. Do we get advantage when he's playing?
4049800	4058800	I've never been a bard, but this might be my only chance.
4058800	4075800	So Dr. Coombes can see, like I say, the drag marks outside and because the ground has frozen overnight, you can actually see the drag marks preserved and you can follow them if you want.
4075800	4077800	I assume you want to. Yeah.
4077800	4088800	Yeah. I mean, the drag marks, they meet up with a number of other sets of footprints. You reckon there were maybe like three or four people in the camp last night.
4088800	4095800	The footprints, they look like men's shoes and I mean, definitely shoes and not boots.
4095800	4105800	And from the general footprints that you can see, they look like they were probably in relatively good condition, which is unusual for people in the camp.
4105800	4117800	Yeah, there's a couple of sets of drag marks, like they dragged two people out, and as you follow them, they go up towards the main road, the road that runs between Crawley and Arken.
4117800	4128800	And you can see that there are some tire tracks there. It looks like there was a car that was parked just off the side of the road that drove off.
4128800	4140800	And from the angle of the tire tracks, it probably drove off towards Arken or at least away from Crawley, away from the town, out of town.
4140800	4146800	Damn. It looks like Billy was taken. Why would they take Billy?
4146800	4148800	Hey, didn't Dr. Rothstein used to work in Arken?
4148800	4149800	He did.
4149800	4156800	Well, maybe we can show him around. I mean, maybe he can show us around.
4156800	4161800	I thought that was just like an old timey phrase.
4161800	4167800	Is Arken, is it walkable? We would have to have a vehicle to get to Arken, right?
4167800	4183800	Arken is probably 20 or 30 miles from here. So it's called the Arken Road because that's the direction it heads in. But, you know, Crawley is just like a mile down the road from here, but Arken is a fair way off.
4183800	4190800	There are a number of things on this road closer than Arken itself.
4190800	4195800	But the tracks lead off on the Arken Road.
4195800	4196800	That's right, yeah.
4196800	4198800	We just don't know that they go all the way.
4198800	4210800	Yeah, you don't know how far they go. The nearest place on the road from here down that way is the Blue Star Diner, which is where you get your used coffee grounds.
4210800	4219800	The woman who runs it, Ida, I think she doesn't really like it when people from the Hooverville turn up there.
4219800	4230800	She certainly won't serve you there because you drive away paying customers. But on the other hand, if she's throwing food and old coffee grounds and stuff like that out, she'll generally let you have it for free.
4230800	4243800	And then beyond there, there are a number of, I guess, private houses, country houses, whatever you'd want to call them, but the more upmarket houses on the outskirts of town.
4243800	4246800	What do you think they would have taken Billy and Esther?
4246800	4250800	I don't know. Did Billy have gambling debts?
4250800	4256800	I don't think Billy was wrapped up in anything like that. He's kind of been the heart and soul of the place these days.
4256800	4262800	I mean, he's 14. He's unlikely to have serious gambling debts, but you never know.
4262800	4269800	Kids grow up fast these days.
4269800	4271800	How far away is the diner?
4271800	4275800	The diner's fairly close. I mean, it's like, you know, five minutes walk down the road from here.
4275800	4278800	And they're open late, I assume?
4278800	4279800	Oh, yeah.
4279800	4286800	I suppose we could go see if Ida saw anything last night. Try to get some intel on that since she's close.
4286800	4287800	That's a good idea.
4287800	4292800	We can at least see if the tracks, you know, go past there or stop somewhere before there.
4292800	4295800	Even if not, we can see if she's got any grounds at all.
4295800	4302800	Because in between here and 30 miles away and last night, there's only going to have been one car that traveled down that road.
4302800	4306800	So the tracks are going to be really obvious.
4306800	4313800	Well, one thing that does perhaps stand out is the tracks, or at least the tire marks that you can see.
4313800	4320800	They're probably not big enough to be a truck, but they certainly look like they're from a car that's bigger than your average car.
4320800	4327800	Didn't there was that guy in camp who always bragged about his Rolls Royce Phantom?
4327800	4330800	Oh, yeah. Hyrum. Hyrum Melnick.
4330800	4331800	Hyrum Melnick.
4331800	4340800	Should we go see Boston? Should we go see him and see if...
4340800	4345800	Let's go ask him if those are Rolls Royce Phantom tracks.
4345800	4347800	Or a big nice car.
4347800	4356800	You know, I did do a fair amount of brick putting, you know, laying cars upon bricks after taking the tires.
4356800	4362800	And, you know, I'm fairly well versed in the thick and thin of a tire.
4362800	4373800	So I could perhaps, you know, maybe put my fingers in this dirt, in this frozen, frozen ice, and just kind of poke around.
4373800	4377800	And just kind of poke around, poke around, poke, poke.
4377800	4383800	You've really got to decide where you're from. Or not. It's fine.
4383800	4393800	I'm from anywhere. I'm from nowhere. I'm Frederick Mellon the foist and I'm from hell. I am going to roll a praise.
4393800	4395800	You're from Whitechapel via the Bronx.
4395800	4401800	Yeah, exactly.
4401800	4409800	Yeah, just gonna roll a praise and see if I... Oh, 32 under 30.
4409800	4420800	Well, I'll tell you what. I'd actually accept education on that because, you know, this seems to come under your general sort of professional skills.
4420800	4423800	Well then, that is a 32 on a 75.
4423800	4426800	Okay, so that's a hard success.
4426800	4431800	So it's going to be difficult to tell a specific make and model from just looking at the tire tracks.
4431800	4439800	But on the other hand, yeah, I mean, you know, you mentioned Hiram's old Rolls Royce.
4439800	4444800	Yeah, I mean, this could be a Rolls Royce. It could be a big model Cadillac.
4444800	4450800	I mean, whatever it is, you're fairly certain that, I mean, it's from a luxury car of some kind.
4450800	4453800	The kind of car that really would stand out.
4453800	4457800	A big, nice sedan. Not big enough to be a truck, but too big for a Model T.
4457800	4458800	Yeah.
4458800	4460800	Well, now we got something to ask our idea about.
4460800	4466800	Yeah, that's good information. We can check in with Ida to see if she's seen a car like that in the last 24 hours.
4466800	4468800	Fancy cars parked in the yard.
4468800	4469800	There it is.
4469800	4473800	Nice.
4473800	4481800	We could just go around back. That way we're not bothering her or any of her customers and we could just kind of knock on the door and say what's up.
4481800	4489800	Yeah, you go down to the Blue Star Diner. This is a classic roadside diner. It's made from a converted railway car.
4489800	4495800	Yeah, it's obviously open. There's a few cars parked outside.
4495800	4500800	And you can see that there are people eating, being served in there.
4500800	4503800	But yeah, going around the back and knocking on the door.
4503800	4509800	Yeah, Larry, the short older cook, comes and opens up the back door and just goes,
4509800	4512800	Hey, Larry, Larry.
4513800	4520800	Why don't we let the doc take this one? I think they might, you know.
4520800	4524800	Doc, they're nice to you. They give you, you know, they feed you here.
4524800	4529800	Hey, Larry, it's Dr. Coons.
4529800	4530800	Yeah.
4530800	4535800	I was wondering if I could, were you here last night? You might be able to help me.
4535800	4539800	I was going to talk to Ida, but if you were here last night, I could ask you too.
4539800	4540800	No.
4540800	4543800	Would you run and grab Ida for me?
4543800	4548800	And he shuts the door and goes back inside.
4548800	4551800	Was that a yes?
4551800	4557800	For a couple of minutes, you've got no idea whether that was a yes, no, fuck off, whatever.
4557800	4563800	But then about two minutes later, Ida comes to the back door. She's looking a bit harried.
4563800	4568800	There's a pencil tucked, and she's got her hair up in a bun, her graying hair.
4568800	4573800	And she's a fairly round, ruddy-faced woman. She's got a pencil tucked behind her ear,
4573800	4580800	looking a bit flustered, and says, You're too early for the leftovers and coffee grounds.
4580800	4585800	Look, come back, come back, say five o'clock. I'll give you what I can then, okay?
4585800	4586800	Sorry.
4586800	4589800	Ida, Ida, it's the doc. It's not bum business.
4589800	4596800	That's not why I'm here, Ida. I'm sorry to bother you. I know you don't like us coming around in the daytime like this,
4596800	4601800	but we're missing a couple people from camp. We have reason to believe they came up this way.
4601800	4608800	You didn't happen to see, I guess, anything strange, but especially a pretty nice car come through here last night?
4608800	4609800	A big one.
4609800	4617800	Yeah, I mean, I was up late doing the books last night, and yeah, I guess, I guess.
4617800	4626800	I mean, there was a big black car that drove up. Yeah, yeah, I didn't really think much of it at the time.
4626800	4632800	It wasn't much traffic, but yeah, it was a Cadillac, I think. Big Cadillac.
4632800	4636800	Did they come in here? Did you see who was driving it?
4636800	4642800	No, no, no, but I know I've seen that before. I've seen it go up and down the road here before.
4642800	4651800	I think it belongs to the man who bought Greenleys. Is that right? Greenleys?
4651800	4656800	I mean, you know that's one of the estates just up the road from here.
4656800	4658800	And that's Hiram's old place.
4658800	4659800	Yeah.
4659800	4662800	I thought about being him. That's why I know.
4662800	4670800	He certainly talked about it enough.
4670800	4677800	So, yeah, all right. Up there, that was Hiram's old place. Yeah, that's not too far from here, right?
4677800	4679800	That's just up the road, right?
4679800	4681800	Yeah, it's like a mile up the road.
4681800	4686800	All right. Ida, thank you. That helps us a lot, actually. That points us in a pretty concrete direction.
4686800	4688800	We were never here.
4688800	4692800	You fellas, you don't get yourself in any trouble now.
4692800	4700800	I'm thinking now that I maybe shouldn't have told you that if you're going to go around and cause trouble with the good man who lives there.
4700800	4705800	Don't let me be hearing from the police that you've gone up there and done something stupid, all right?
4705800	4709800	Absolutely not, Ida. This is back of house only.
4709800	4718800	We're not going to be dealing with anybody in society who might get the feathers ruffled. This is bum business.
4718800	4725800	It's just hobo nonsense.
4725800	4732800	Yeah, if you don't say our names, we won't have your name in our mouth either, Ida.
4732800	4740800	Yeah, she's really looking like she's regretted saying anything at all to you now.
4740800	4748800	Anyway, if you fellas will excuse me, I've got paying customers to deal with and a whole lot of things to reconsider.
4748800	4755800	You personally have been a huge help. Thank you so much for everything you've done and told us.
4755800	4759800	Love's not the right word, but something similar.
4759800	4760800	Affection.
4760800	4764800	Yeah, yeah, she says, and shuts the door on your face.
4764800	4767800	I'm going to take a restroom break real quick.
4767800	4773800	You think you can use the bathroom at the Blue Star Diner?
4773800	4778800	You guys distract Ida. It's a number one, I promise.
4778800	4783800	You can piss in the hole in the ground like everyone else.
4783800	4786800	I'm going to do that as well.
4786800	4791800	Piss in the hole in the ground.
4791800	4793800	This is great so far, Scott. Thanks for doing this.
4793800	4797800	Oh yeah, no, my pleasure.
4797800	4800800	For starters, it's really great to have an opportunity to play with you guys.
4800800	4805800	It's great to have a chance to run this game because it's been a long time since I've done so.
4805800	4808800	I've never actually recorded this one.
4808800	4811800	It's got a creepy flavor, man.
4811800	4815800	Scritching and scratching got me.
4815800	4820800	I think this is one of the darker things I've written.
4820800	4823800	Okay, I think we were going to head down to...
4823800	4825800	And one of the players...
4825800	4827800	Sorry, no, go ahead.
4827800	4829800	No, no, no, no, Kerry.
4829800	4832800	Yeah, we could use a Hyrum right now.
4832800	4834800	Thomas Dolan.
4834800	4837800	So, are you heading...
4837800	4839800	Zach, were you suggesting that we go back to get Hyrum?
4839800	4841800	The question on everyone's mind is that we either...
4841800	4843800	Oh, it's every single time.
4843800	4848800	Every single time from three continents.
4848800	4850800	Yeah, I know.
4850800	4856800	We got lag working all over the place.
4856800	4860800	I'm not going to say shit.
4860800	4863800	But yeah, so are you heading straight to Green Lees?
4863800	4868800	Are you going back to the camp for any reason?
4868800	4870800	What's your plan here?
4870800	4877800	Maybe go ask Hyrum some questions about his business partner who now owns Green Lees.
4877800	4878800	Yeah.
4878800	4883800	At the very least, he could give us a lay of the land, maybe tell us about the house.
4883800	4887800	Ideally, we'd bring him with us to act as a guide.
4887800	4892800	If you're going to sneak into a place and you know someone who used to live there,
4892800	4898800	it's smart to ask him questions about doors and windows and other holes.
4898800	4899800	Just any holes.
4899800	4900800	Yeah, let's do that.
4900800	4901800	General, yeah.
4901800	4904800	General holery.
4904800	4907800	All the holes of a home.
4907800	4908800	All the house holes.
4908800	4913800	No one knows it like a former homeowner.
4913800	4914800	Boston.
4914800	4918800	Okay, so you head back.
4918800	4921800	You head back to the camp.
4921800	4925800	Oh, God.
4925800	4928800	Sorry, Scott.
4928800	4938800	Please paint your word picture for us.
4938800	4940800	So you head back.
4940800	4943800	I'll say that again with that.
4943800	4947800	So you head back into the Hoveville.
4947800	4957800	At this stage, when you get back to the camp, Hyrum has gone over to the medical tent.
4957800	4964800	Having heard that Nancy is there, he's basically kneeling on the ground beside Nancy,
4964800	4967800	just talking to her, comforting her.
4967800	4972800	And when you come into the shack, he looks up and says,
4972800	4975800	what the hell happened last night?
4975800	4979800	Nancy, I mean, what happened to her?
4979800	4983800	She's just, I don't know.
4983800	4985800	We're looking into it.
4985800	4991800	She's saying all sorts of crazy things about men with no faces and puppets and, yeah,
4991800	4993800	something about a singing puppet.
4993800	4998800	As far as we can tell, a very experimental vaudeville show.
4998800	4999800	But it is weird.
4999800	5001800	A lot of weird things are going on.
5001800	5004800	Hyrum, we need to ask you about your old estate.
5004800	5009800	I'm starting to say with 100% confidence that the people who did this,
5009800	5014800	who came into our Hoveville and took our little Esther and our medium-sized Billy,
5014800	5020800	and took them all out, they took them to Greenlee's, the place that you used to own.
5020800	5026800	And now the livers in there, the people, the internal organs who do their business
5026800	5030800	inside the house that you once called your own abode,
5030800	5035800	they're the ones who came in here and they might not have faces from what she's saying,
5035800	5040800	but we're not sure about that, but we can be positive that it's those,
5040800	5046800	those are the ones who did then do this to us and we're gonna fight back,
5046800	5050800	not only gonna fight back with guns and with fists,
5050800	5052800	but we're not gonna do either one of those things.
5052800	5054800	We're gonna fight back with stealth.
5054800	5056800	They're not gonna know we were there. We were never there.
5056800	5058800	We were there and then we were gone.
5058800	5061800	And we'll come back with our people and they won't know it.
5062800	5067800	Or, you know, we go in right off the bat with whatever you think
5067800	5070800	Because it used to be your home, you tell us what you think.
5070800	5071800	Right, questions.
5071800	5073800	You think we should do the stealth or the guns, yeah.
5073800	5080800	So what, you're saying that you think, what, Caspar Brink's got something to do with taking the kids?
5080800	5081800	No.
5081800	5083800	That's, yeah, that's crazy.
5083800	5089800	I mean, you know, the man's an animal, he's, you know, he's a thief,
5089800	5093800	he's the scum of the earth, but kidnapping kids?
5093800	5095800	Does he have a big black car?
5095800	5099800	Yeah, he's got plenty of cars.
5099800	5106800	He bought my old cars along with the house and, yeah, he always had cars of his own.
5106800	5108800	A big black Cadillac?
5108800	5110800	Yeah, yeah, he's got a caddy.
5110800	5113800	We don't exactly have time to, like, clue you in on everything,
5113800	5118800	but Billy and Esther were, like, 100% seen taken away from here
5118800	5121800	in a big black caddy towards your estate.
5121800	5123800	Son of a bitch.
5123800	5130800	As I say, I always knew Caspar was a thief, but stealing children?
5130800	5132800	Yeah, well, yeah, you got to go get him back.
5132800	5138800	I mean, look, I'll tell you what, if you want to get in there, take him by surprise,
5138800	5141800	you go around the back, there's some old servants' quarters around there.
5141800	5145800	I mean, I never had anyone there, but there's old servants' quarters.
5145800	5148800	And yeah, I mean, I don't know if he's had any work done,
5148800	5158800	but there's a window just by the back door that the lock on that is terrible, terrible, terrible lock.
5158800	5160800	I was meant to get it fixed.
5160800	5164800	Even if it was a wonderful lock, I'm not worried about it.
5166800	5170800	But yeah, yeah, you break in there and, yeah, you should be fine.
5170800	5172800	That's helpful, Hiram.
5172800	5174800	Yeah, we really appreciate your help, Hiram.
5174800	5178800	Hiram, put yourself in these shoes for a second, if you will.
5178800	5182800	You've got two kids and you're trying to hide them, and you live in your old house.
5182800	5183800	Where would you put them?
5183800	5185800	I guess down to the cellars.
5186800	5190800	That, I mean, guys, you might think this a little bit weird at this point in my narrative,
5190800	5197800	but that also answers my next question, which is where would be the best place to sacrifice two children in your old estates?
5197800	5204800	Just call it a hunch, Freddie and Doc, but that's the vibe I'm getting.
5204800	5207800	Anyway, we should think, Hiram, you've been a big help.
5207800	5209800	Let's go, right guys?
5209800	5210800	Hiram, do you want to come?
5210800	5213800	He said, no, no, no, I'll stay here and look after Nancy.
5213800	5216800	You know, the state she's in.
5216800	5220800	Yeah, she, no, I'll stay here with her.
5220800	5222800	That's wicked smart.
5222800	5231800	The doctor's going to go to go around to his personal tent, his living quarters, and grab his little .38 revolver.
5231800	5232800	Okay.
5232800	5235800	Freddie, you didn't come across any amazing guns today.
5238800	5243800	As Thomas says that, Frederick Dolan I, Frederick Mellon I, oh, we got married.
5243800	5245800	Frederick Dolan I, I took your name.
5245800	5247800	You took my first.
5248800	5252800	So now we're both Freddie Dolan.
5254800	5257800	Mr. Freddie Dolan, the first.
5257800	5270800	He's like patting off Hiram's shoulders of any dust or anything on his shoulders and kind of touching at his cap and pulling up his shirt and making him look nice.
5270800	5272800	And he's just saying, thank you, thank you, thank you so much.
5272800	5275800	Now look under your hat.
5276800	5280800	And he's going to try to have a 50 cents sitting on top of Hiram's head.
5281800	5284800	Give me a slot of hand roll to see whether you pull that off.
5285800	5286800	Yes.
5286800	5288800	I rolled an ought seven on a 50.
5288800	5289800	Oh, wow.
5289800	5290800	Okay.
5290800	5291800	Yeah.
5291800	5292800	Extreme success.
5292800	5293800	So yeah.
5293800	5294800	Yeah.
5294800	5295800	He takes his hat off.
5295800	5298800	You got to tell me how you do that someday, man.
5298800	5301800	He says, he just waggles his fingers in Hiram's face.
5303800	5309800	And then he, uh, he dips off and says, uh, I'll meet you guys, uh, up there at the front.
5309800	5310800	I'll be just a second.
5310800	5315800	Uh, and when he comes back, he comes back with a, with a shotgun, hopefully.
5315800	5316800	Yeah.
5316800	5317800	And about half a dozen shells.
5317800	5319800	Have you guys ever fired one of these things?
5319800	5321800	I have only shot it like twice.
5322800	5326800	Sarah, it's just, um, I was just studying Thomas Dolan's character profile.
5327800	5329800	Does he have any weapons around the camp?
5329800	5332800	Would that, would it be realistic to say he has a pistol stowed away or something?
5332800	5334800	Um, probably not.
5334800	5335800	Yeah.
5336800	5337800	You don't need a gun.
5337800	5338800	You got to fiddle.
5338800	5340800	That's fucking true.
5340800	5341800	I'm the bard.
5341800	5343800	I've got to start acting like it.
5343800	5352800	So, um, yeah, Thomas Dolan plays a mournful, but, um, but hopeful tune, bittersweet would
5352800	5356800	be the best word for it as we set out on the road for our adventure.
5357800	5365800	Uh, by the way, just before you go, I mean, one thing as, as Coombes is just sort of finishing
5365800	5371800	up in the, the medical shack before you head out, one thing you notice, the Mason jar that
5371800	5376800	you left with the, the eggs and the, the specimen in it.
5376800	5378800	The eggs are still there.
5378800	5380800	The specimen isn't.
5380800	5382800	Uh oh.
5383800	5389800	Uh, boys, I think we got to maybe deal with, yeah, we got to deal with some local issues
5389800	5391800	before we hit off that trail.
5391800	5396800	Do we see a little, a slime trail or anything leading out of the jar?
5396800	5397800	You do.
5397800	5399800	Is there a hole where it's drilled through?
5399800	5403800	Yeah, there is no hole in the jar.
5403800	5410800	The, the lid of it is still sealed, but there does seem to be a little trail of slime coming
5410800	5411800	out the side of it.
5412800	5414800	How did it, how did it get out of the, out of the jar?
5414800	5417800	It's, and I, I hold it up and kind of shake it a little.
5417800	5418800	It's intact.
5418800	5423800	As you shake it, one of the other eggs ruptures slightly and something begins to wriggle out
5423800	5424800	of it.
5424800	5425800	Oops.
5425800	5426800	Oops.
5426800	5427800	And he sets it down carefully.
5427800	5431800	Guys, obviously it took the lid off, put the lid back on.
5431800	5433800	It's lit away.
5433800	5434800	Not that hot.
5434800	5437800	Let's look for, let's look for where it's livid.
5437800	5438800	Yeah.
5438800	5447800	As you follow the slime trail, it moves over to the cot that Maureen Frayn is sleeping
5447800	5449800	on at the moment.
5449800	5451800	Naturally, yeah.
5451800	5455800	That's what it's going to want to do.
5455800	5459800	My medical opinion now is that this thing is a parasite of some kind.
5459800	5466800	Maybe I can sedate Agatha for, for a while, just until we figure out a way to destroy
5466800	5467800	Maureen Frayn.
5467800	5468800	I'm sorry, Maureen.
5468800	5469800	Yeah.
5469800	5470800	Doc, no offense.
5470800	5472800	That sounds overly cautious.
5472800	5478800	I don't think anybody in the future is going to judge you if we eliminate this host right
5478800	5481800	now in an abundance of caution.
5481800	5483800	Oh, that's not necessary.
5483800	5485800	I could say I could save her potentially.
5485800	5487800	We could figure this out and I could save her.
5487800	5489800	We just need to make sure she doesn't leave here while we're gone.
5489800	5491800	Can we see where it went in?
5491800	5495800	Does it look like it crawled through a nostril or a mouth or something or did it bury like
5495800	5496800	right into her abdomen?
5496800	5499800	It looks like it crawled towards her abdomen.
5499800	5501800	Maybe we can pull it out of there.
5501800	5502800	Poke around, Doc.
5502800	5503800	See what you find.
5503800	5507800	Maybe, I mean, like pull her shirt up above her belly button, see if it's still trying
5507800	5508800	to crawl in.
5508800	5509800	Right.
5509800	5510800	Exactly.
5510800	5515800	You kind of pull her shirt up and there is, yeah, that little trail of slime that then
5515800	5524800	goes to pretty much just above her navel and then disappears.
5524800	5533800	But there's no hole or wound or even there's nothing on the body, no mark on the body?
5533800	5541800	Well, as Dr. Coombs examines and looks for a wound or any mark, you press her abdomen
5541800	5549800	just where that trail ends and your finger just sinks in through her flesh.
5549800	5554800	It's like sticking your finger into a bowl of warm porridge.
5554800	5560800	And you can feel something wriggling around down to the bottom.
5560800	5562800	Let's have a sanity roll.
5562800	5563800	Okay.
5563800	5564800	Yeah.
5564800	5565800	Appropriate.
5565800	5568800	I pass really, really well.
5568800	5571800	It's a 9 on a 37.
5571800	5573800	Yeah, you're fine then.
5573800	5579800	Keeping your composure even as your finger is sticking into her abdomen.
5579800	5587800	And what's really, really weird about this is there doesn't seem to be a wound.
5587800	5595800	As you pull your finger out, there is no indication that you even broke the skin.
5595800	5596800	Wow.
5596800	5598800	Holy shit.
5598800	5600800	Maureen isn't conscious, right?
5600800	5601800	Mercifully, no.
5601800	5604800	Fellas, I felt it in there.
5604800	5605800	It's in there.
5605800	5607800	I felt it wriggling around.
5607800	5611800	There's a chance I could get it with my tweezers.
5611800	5613800	Do you think I should or do you think we should?
5613800	5617800	Thomas Dolan is shakily handling you, your surgical tongs.
5617800	5623800	I take them and that's my goal now is to try and use my surgical tongs to try and grab
5623800	5625800	the wriggling creature that I felt a second ago.
5625800	5627800	My goal is to pull it out.
5627800	5629800	Frederick, get the jar ready.
5629800	5631800	The jar didn't do fucking nothing last time.
5631800	5637800	Well, let's have a Dex roll to see how well you pull this off.
5637800	5642800	Oh, it's a 71 on a 70.
5642800	5644800	Oh, no.
5644800	5646800	Push it, push it.
5646800	5648800	Well, you've got a couple of options.
5648800	5650800	I'm going to pull this off.
5651800	5652800	Oh, no.
5652800	5654800	Push it, push it.
5654800	5655800	Well, you've got a couple of options.
5655800	5660800	You could spend a point of luck on changing that to a 70.
5660800	5666800	Alternatively, you could push the roll so that you haven't quite managed to get an angle
5666800	5675800	in there with the forceps, but if you really push, you could try to force me.
5675800	5677800	I'm going to use the luck spend.
5677800	5685800	I'm going to spend a point of luck to get the...
5685800	5687800	I'm so disappointed in you.
5687800	5691800	You're no fun.
5691800	5697800	This is a woman's life, Scott.
5697800	5700800	That brings my luck down to 19.
5700800	5708800	You manage to force the forceps in through the comparatively small area of her abdomen
5708800	5710800	that's permeable.
5710800	5715800	But, yeah, you manage to get hold of the wriggling creature and pull it out.
5715800	5720800	And, yeah, it's writhing around within the forceps and screaming again.
5720800	5728800	Now that you've got it out, it does look significantly larger than when you saw it before.
5728800	5730800	It's pretty much doubled in size.
5730800	5739800	Doc, I know you're on Team Ja, but what if you just let us smash this thing right now?
5739800	5744800	Is he Rasta?
5744800	5745800	Team Ja.
5745800	5746800	Team Ja.
5746800	5757800	I was actually really proud of how I managed to make that Boston.
5757800	5760800	Dr. Coombes is like, no, you're right.
5760800	5762800	We can't risk it getting out again.
5762800	5764800	Let's destroy this one.
5764800	5767800	And I've got the eggs that I can run my tests on.
5767800	5769800	So how are you destroying it?
5769800	5770800	Boot it.
5770800	5772800	Yeah, I'm going to drop it on the ground and try and step on it.
5772800	5773800	Okay.
5773800	5776800	Give me a luck roll.
5776800	5778800	Maybe don't drop it.
5778800	5781800	Maybe just place it under your boot.
5781800	5784800	Dudes, I failed with a 100.
5784800	5787800	It's a zero, zero, zero.
5787800	5791800	Okay, so you drop it on the ground and you stamp on it.
5791800	5796800	And there's no resistance, no squishing sound, nothing like that.
5796800	5800800	And when you bring your boot back up, there's no trace of it.
5800800	5814800	No.
5814800	5816800	I'm lifting up my foot.
5816800	5818800	Did you get out from under it?
5818800	5819800	I don't see it.
5819800	5820800	It's not, where is it?
5820800	5826800	I'm shaking my head and looking at you sideways and passing the tongs to you.
5826800	5828800	It's like your foot was the jaw.
5828800	5830800	I'm not pulling this thing out of your foot.
5830800	5831800	You mean?
5831800	5838800	What do you feel though, as you realize that this thing has crawled inside your flesh,
5838800	5843800	is perversely, you have a sense of immense wellbeing.
5843800	5853800	For some reason, your spirits are lifted and yeah, you feel almost a surge of hope
5853800	5860800	and just this lightness in your heart that hasn't been there for a long time.
5860800	5863800	And yeah, let's break there.
5863800	5865800	Oh my God.
5865800	5868800	Holy shit.
5868800	5873800	Scott, this is dope.
5874800	5880800	Life surreal, in retrospect a dream.
5880800	5886800	Easy times, feel less than serene.
5886800	5894800	In the moment it's hard to count your blessings.
5894800	5900800	So we long for days gone past us.
5900800	5909800	Grief and strife, bloody, that's real life.
