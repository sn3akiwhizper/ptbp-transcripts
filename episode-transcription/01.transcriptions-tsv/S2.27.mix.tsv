149880	154880	or at work or a quiet coffee shop, congratulations.
155080	157320	Y'all just won the opportunity
157320	159840	to support this show financially
159840	163840	over at patreon.com slash pretending pod.
163840	166720	There you'll find bonus content,
166720	171720	the chance to name a PTBP NPC or location,
172120	177120	BTS live streams, exclusive merch, and more.
178120	180160	And guess where the links are?
180160	181000	Do it.
181000	181840	Guess.
181840	185460	No, like out loud, come on, don't be shy now.
185460	187240	Say it with me, y'all.
187240	190840	The links are in the show notes.
190840	193480	Where even are the show notes?
193480	195280	Have you ever seen them?
195280	197760	Are they even real?
197760	200920	Have the show notes been reported on?
200920	205680	Because it ain't real if it ain't on the news.
205680	210680	Last time, after a quick flashback to fill in a time gap,
211080	213680	Julius Summers went a tad off the map
213680	216720	and revealed that he's strapped when he pop, pop,
217160	218480	popped a couple of gops
218480	221960	and the brother of the wife of his pops.
221960	225880	And SG, Stevie Godel, revealed the plan
225880	229320	to blackmail their dad with the footage they were acquiring
229320	232880	from officers Richard Riley and Wilson Wiley,
232880	236400	who are new on the Godel payroll and easily swayed
236400	240480	by the daughter of the great Fred Godel himself.
240480	242720	The main issue, seemingly,
242720	245640	is that Julius just thinks he's a bit wet
245640	248560	instead of covered in blood and viscera.
248560	251280	Taking us now to a pearl of a scene
251280	253880	that would make a weaker wolf hurl
253880	256920	and scream for a bowl of curdled cream,
256920	260560	it's altar girl with my life is great
260560	263560	and it's all my fault.
263560	267560	And it's all my fault
267560	272560	Cause my life is great
272560	277560	And it's all my
282000	287000	Cause my life is great
287000	292000	And it's all my fault
292000	297000	And it's all my fault
299880	303040	All right, so Thomas and Joe, you both got luck then.
303040	303880	Yeah.
303880	304720	Yeah.
304720	306320	You can see it from my shiny luck token here.
306320	307600	Look at there.
307600	309880	Why don't you flick that in the air for me?
309880	311200	Oh, that's nice.
311200	312160	Joe, how about you?
312160	314000	No, no, no, wait, wait.
314000	317440	Whoa, wow, that was good.
317440	318520	I liked it.
318520	319480	Let's go.
319480	320400	You guys wanna go?
320400	321240	You were just, okay.
321240	322280	You were just taking the temperature
322280	323320	as far as the luck is.
323320	324160	Sorry.
332680	333520	Luca.
333520	335600	It's impossible to explain that joke.
338720	341080	Luca reached over the entire table.
343320	345040	It was very funny.
345040	349400	Oh, it was the, it's four 20 everybody.
351400	352240	Wow.
352240	354480	This is the energy we're bringing to the four 20.
354480	357320	It's the day where you smoke weed and don't ask for help.
359000	362000	That might be an issue for the gang tonight.
364560	366400	Can you guys, can you let me in?
366400	368080	Let's set the scene real quick.
368080	370040	You guys are on the Northeast corner
370920	374840	in a downtown intersection of the city.
376120	379360	You're just Northeast of the Natcher Hole.
379360	380480	You're in a parking lot.
380560	385560	You are sitting in Cal Colorado's white Mercedes C-Class.
386440	387280	Nice car.
390480	392760	Thanks, you're the one who told us it was nice.
394200	399200	And Julius Summers just pulled up.
399200	403400	Cal Colorado, Beck Wilder and Stevie
403400	406000	were in the Cadillac there
406000	408320	and in the Mercedes C-Class there.
408320	409160	Come on.
409800	410640	Who would ever say that?
410640	411480	What is this?
412520	413840	Ants.
413840	415760	A car that you all don't recognize pulls up.
415760	418800	It's a car driven by Jeremy, the intern who-
418800	419720	Classic character.
419720	421360	Everyone loves him.
421360	424080	He's very, very rattled at all times.
424080	425240	What's he sound like?
425240	429240	His eyes are super wide, that's for sure.
429240	432760	And Julius, oh, you're getting out of the car.
432760	434440	Okay, oh, thank God, oh, thank God.
434440	438160	And we're just sitting in Jeremy's car for a second
438200	442080	after Julius has left and he breathes
442080	446240	for seemingly the first time in a while.
446240	448080	And this is where we leave you
448080	451840	as Jeremy slowly starts pulling out
451840	453880	of the parking spot next to you.
453880	457440	I wave my hands in the air and get behind his car
457440	458840	or not like where I could be hit,
458840	460640	but I'm like, Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy, hold up, hold up.
460640	461800	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
461800	463520	Yeah, Julius sees Cal waving
463520	467360	and he like slaps Jeremy's car to get his attention.
467400	469120	It pulls back into the spot.
469120	470440	I go up to the front window
470440	472720	and I like motion for him to roll it down.
473680	475240	Do you think they can hear us?
475240	476600	You mean the other two?
477640	480800	Julius is like standing right there like watching this.
480800	482880	Julius, could you go help Beck
482880	487880	with a weird fungal problem that he has on his body?
490160	491760	No.
491760	495020	Well, he needs someone to vent about to it
495020	496160	and I'm tired of hearing it.
496160	497480	Could you just go be a friend
497480	500320	and listen to him for a minute, over there?
500320	503760	Well, can you unlock your car and I'll hop in?
507040	510680	It's really important that you talk to Beck
510680	513160	about his embarrassing skin problem.
513160	514200	Where are you at?
514200	515800	Am I in the car still?
515800	517480	I don't remember if I got out or not.
517480	518320	I think we ended with-
518320	520520	I think plausibly you could be like standing
520520	521720	outside the passenger seat watching this go on.
521720	523720	Episodes start in different places all the time.
523720	524640	Yeah, that's true.
524640	527360	The reason I clarify though is because
527360	528960	Stevie was doing weird shit.
528960	529840	I don't know if I want to-
529840	532280	Stevie is still in the car, yes.
532280	533880	So you can just roll down the window and talk to him.
533880	534720	That's what I'll do.
534720	536120	Roll down my passenger window.
536120	538360	I'll stick my head in Cal's car.
538360	540240	And I'm kind of grossed out by that, right?
540240	541560	He's covered from head to toe.
541560	542400	Oh, absolutely.
542400	544260	Cal shouts, hey Beck Beck,
544260	547160	don't let him stick his head in the car.
547160	552160	Yeah, Julius, yeah, covered in blood and brain matter.
552880	557540	His nose is bleeding and you can see a shoulder,
557540	559580	like a gunshot in his shoulder.
559580	561720	Jesus, is it healed?
561720	563400	Like, has it been attended to medically?
563400	567040	It happened less than an hour ago.
567040	568800	It happened so fast.
568800	571680	It happened, how long did it take me to get from can to-
571680	572680	Very little time.
572680	574200	Jeremy drove very quickly.
574200	576640	So speaking to Jeremy, Cal's like, okay,
576640	580160	I don't think Julius is in much position to relay-
580160	581000	Headphones, boys.
581000	582320	What's going on here?
582320	583580	So as quickly as possible,
583580	585580	can you tell me what the fuck happened?
586880	588040	Yeah, get the fuck out.
589440	590340	I love you.
590340	591180	Bye.
592420	595000	Wait, but, oh, nevermind.
595000	596400	Okay.
596400	600280	Okay, so we hear gunshots, multiple gunshots
600280	603000	and nobody went in, obviously, but we called the cops
603000	608000	and Julius came out of Type's office with blood all over me.
608000	613000	And over and over and over and over, beep, beep, beep, beep.
614720	618680	And then he just came out and then everyone was taking
618680	623680	videos and photos and it was so sad and it was just like,
626600	631600	he's just like, he's got a gun on him and he's dangerous.
633440	636040	He killed the high-freaking.
636560	641320	If he looks up, he would see that Cal has been filming
641320	642560	this all on his phone.
645720	649000	Yeah, no, he's in no state to try to roll there.
651280	652760	I don't know what to do.
652760	655960	He told me to drive him to you guys
656920	658720	and he knew where you were.
658720	663400	And so I drove him because, you know, gun and murder
663400	666000	and he's covered in blood and he thinks he's just wet.
666880	668640	Wow, yes.
668640	670720	Who kills their uncle?
670720	672120	Who shoots anyone?
672120	672960	Wait, what?
672960	676160	It's too early to speculate, but Type may not have been
676160	679200	the man you thought he was, if what you thought he was
679200	681120	was a good man.
681120	684840	Cal, that is not the reaction that I was expecting from you.
684840	686920	Well, Jeremy, unfortunately.
686920	689120	You're saying that the victim was a bad guy?
689120	690920	Well, yes, I think objectively.
690920	693840	He was a bad man who did not care about the news.
693840	696600	He was ill-suited for his position.
696600	699760	I'm not happy he died, but Jeremy,
699760	702320	big things are going on today, strange things.
702320	704680	We have reason to believe Type was involved
704680	707240	with corrupt police officers.
707240	708360	That doesn't mean, that doesn't, oh.
708360	711040	Working for the Godel Corporation,
711040	714640	they stole our footage of the most insane news story
714640	716520	that I have ever personally covered.
716520	719360	Type was a part of them, Julius is now too.
719360	723440	I guess we already were, but we need your help.
723440	726800	No, no, I'm not fucking, wait.
726800	727920	Roll persuade. Yeah, I was like,
727920	730400	I'm so sorry, I meant to persuade you
730400	731560	that we need your help.
732920	735000	He's gonna pass with a 16.
735000	735960	This is contested?
735960	736800	Yeah.
736800	738000	I pass with a 67.
738000	740320	Oh, you done got him.
740320	742080	No, absolutely not.
743040	745840	My duty is to the news,
745840	748520	cause I'm an intern and I don't work for money,
748520	750600	I work for truth.
750600	752640	Yes, that's right.
753480	756560	Cal is like, tears are in his eyes
756560	760120	and he's swelling with pride.
760120	762840	And he says, God damn it, Jeremy.
762840	763720	Yeah.
763720	765360	That's what I'm fucking talking about.
765360	766640	That's what I'm talking about.
766640	767720	That's what I'm talking about.
767720	769240	That's what I'm talking about.
769240	771920	Beck, you might wanna get away from Julius.
771920	774840	All right, let's get him back.
776200	777040	That was fun.
777960	779880	Thomas, if you could walk out real quick.
779880	780720	Yeah.
780720	784360	The TV looks at Julius's blood-covered head
784360	788880	that is through the window and without missing a beat,
788880	790480	Julius, what the fuck happened?
790480	794560	And I need you back to roll a grip check
794560	799560	for this face being so close to you.
801120	806120	This man being so uninterested in his own...
807400	808240	I failed.
808240	809480	Bodily health.
809480	810680	That's a 91.
810680	814880	I need my other character sheet.
814880	819880	That's hilarious.
825000	827080	Hey, while you're doing that, Beck.
827080	827920	Yeah.
827920	830960	Joe, if you could roll a grip check for me and fail.
830960	832760	And now if you could roll a...
832760	834200	Did you fail?
834200	838720	If you could roll a nothing, you just lose one.
838800	842960	Lose one grip as this face is just inching near you.
842960	843840	You were like...
843840	846760	Utterly grossed out just because it's blood and viscera.
846760	849280	But then I see that there's maybe a bullet wound
849280	850600	in the shoulder and I'm like,
850600	852960	oh fuck, this could be a mortal wound.
852960	855160	He could be dying in front of me.
855160	856480	Holy shit.
856480	859160	Julius, my dude, I think you're bleeding out, dude.
859160	861800	Julius looks down at it.
861800	864600	I mean, I told you, I just got wet.
864600	865960	I mean, I'll dry off, it's fine.
866000	869280	I mean, I think you will dry off eventually
869280	870480	because of death.
870480	872440	There's no more to be coming out, yeah.
872440	875320	Julius is literally looking like,
875320	877320	what the fuck are you talking about?
877320	878800	Luke, how many hit points do you have?
878800	879640	Two.
881760	882920	I sneeze and headbutt.
882920	883760	Oh shit.
885880	887120	Julius dies.
889000	892400	I'm gonna put my hand past his head and pound on the roof
892400	895840	and Carol, we gotta get him to a hospital.
896600	897840	At that exact moment,
897840	901480	he is yelling something equally loud at you.
903920	905360	Which was what?
905360	907880	I believe he said, Beck.
909760	910600	Yeah.
912760	914600	Oh, Thomas.
914600	915440	Tommy.
915440	917600	Tommy Pickles.
917600	918920	Tommy Pickles was the first Tommy
918920	920040	that popped into my head too.
920040	921440	Really?
921440	922920	For sure though.
922920	924640	Beck, Beck, get away from him.
924640	927880	And at that exact moment, Beck is yelling back at you.
927880	929320	We gotta get him to a hospital.
929320	931640	Cal, come on, get in the car.
931640	933480	Put him in this car, it's already ruined
933480	935120	and Jeremy is on our side.
936920	938200	Beck, I love you like a son,
938200	941240	but if you let him in my car, I'll be disappointed.
941240	942200	I don't know.
942200	943800	Is our cherry removable?
943800	946560	The thing that we've been running around, the siren light?
946560	948920	Yeah, it literally just is like suction cups on top.
948920	951960	I pull it out of like the dashboard or out of the glove box
952000	955640	and I toss it over the car to Cal.
955640	956920	All right, we'll get him in that car.
956920	958240	We just gotta go, we just gotta go.
958240	960360	Cal catches it pretty nimbly.
960360	961200	Oh yeah?
961200	962320	I gotta imagine he was like.
962320	964160	Let's get some athletics checks.
964160	968200	See how smoothly this very intense,
968200	970360	very serious situation goes.
972000	975760	I guess it has been a while since high school baseball
975760	980360	and Cal fumbles, I do not pass either.
980360	983920	So it's already like a wild throw.
983920	987760	It's a wild pitch off to the side and you reach out
987760	990920	way for it and it touches your fingers though.
990920	993280	So you know deep down you could have caught it.
995680	998140	Just like the story if it gets away from us.
999920	1002000	Julius, man, we gotta get into that car
1002000	1002960	that you just got out of.
1002960	1004320	We gotta get you back into that one
1004320	1005800	and we gotta get you to the hospital, dude.
1005800	1007160	You're gonna die.
1007160	1008000	What?
1009000	1012480	Beck wants to, he feels like he needs to snap Julius
1012480	1014600	into it and he wants to poke the wound
1014600	1016400	to see if that elicits a response.
1016400	1018600	Holy fucking shit.
1018600	1022400	When he reaches out for you, do you counter?
1022400	1024040	No.
1024040	1024880	Poke.
1024880	1025960	Lose one hit point.
1025960	1026800	Oh!
1026800	1027840	Fuck.
1027840	1030080	You killed Julius.
1030080	1031240	Can I use your pencil?
1032120	1032960	Thank you.
1032960	1033800	No actually.
1033800	1035040	That would take me to one hit point.
1035040	1037220	Let's have you roll con to see if you lose
1037220	1038060	one hit point here.
1038060	1039300	Roll con.
1039300	1041260	Can it be taken into account that I wasn't
1041260	1044500	like trying to injure, I was trying to shock.
1044500	1045900	56 on a 55.
1048820	1049900	You did both.
1052580	1053420	Well did it?
1053420	1054260	Did it shock?
1054260	1056020	Do you respond to that other than?
1056020	1058740	Julius Summers vomits through the window.
1058740	1059580	Into the car.
1059580	1061260	Into the car, onto your lap,
1061260	1064020	into the white Mercedes C-Class.
1064020	1065580	Now do you believe me, dude?
1065580	1066660	That's a wound, man.
1066980	1068140	You're injured.
1068140	1069420	Julius, when you look down,
1069420	1072540	you see yourself absolutely covered in blood
1072540	1076380	and you are in a wild amount of pain
1076380	1078780	seemingly out of fucking nowhere.
1078780	1082900	What the fuck?
1082900	1084300	Yeah, yeah, exactly my dude.
1084300	1085140	Get in the car.
1085140	1087580	He stumbles into Jeremy's car.
1087580	1090080	Cal slaps the cherry on top,
1090080	1091940	slaps Jeremy in the face.
1092820	1093660	Thank you.
1093660	1094900	Get him to the hospital.
1094940	1096980	Do it for old lady news.
1097820	1099540	Absolutely, sir, yes sir.
1099540	1102260	Hand to my, hand to my, hand to my forehead,
1102260	1103460	fingers flat.
1103460	1105660	Julius hears like get him to the hospital
1105660	1106900	like they're not coming with me
1106900	1108260	and he gets out of the car.
1111820	1114260	We gotta solve it together.
1114260	1116780	Julius, you know, the last time you tried to pull this,
1116780	1118520	no offense, we lost God.
1118520	1121580	So why don't you just go to the fucking hospital?
1121580	1122780	If I recall correctly,
1122780	1124380	you lost God when I was in the hospital.
1124740	1127300	Who knows what happened when Julius.
1127300	1130380	Good point, I will not be going to the hospital.
1130380	1134020	And he starts to just kind of try to wipe himself off
1134020	1137480	and like holds the bullet wound.
1137480	1139620	Go ahead and roll a first aid on yourself
1139620	1143300	if you have it to try to look around and find.
1143300	1145180	Fail again.
1145180	1146660	Are you excited about that?
1146660	1147500	No.
1148780	1149620	Do you have any first aid back there?
1149620	1153020	You find some fast food napkins in Jeremy's glove box.
1153060	1155520	He shoves it in the wound.
1155520	1156420	I turn around to Stevie.
1156420	1159060	Stevie, is there any chance that you know like
1159060	1161100	maybe how to stop the bleeding on this?
1161100	1164200	Hey, I do have one luck that I have written down.
1165380	1169120	It's been scratched out and then replaced, but I have it.
1171020	1173500	That's extremely confusing based on the conversation
1173500	1175780	we had at the top of the app.
1175780	1177700	Okay, yeah, then I don't, nevermind.
1180020	1182260	I believe you, but it sounds like a lie.
1183860	1186380	I need you guys to answer a question for me
1186380	1189960	because I rolled for first aid.
1189960	1192360	I think base is 30, is that correct?
1192360	1193200	10.
1193200	1194020	10, yeah.
1194020	1196140	Okay, so I gave Stevie a plus 20.
1196140	1201140	I rolled both D10s and one said 80
1201540	1204460	and the other one rolled off the table.
1204460	1205300	Reroll them both.
1205300	1207700	Am I supposed to reroll them both?
1207700	1208520	Yeah.
1208520	1209360	Yes, of course.
1209360	1211300	As we've always played.
1211300	1212260	So reroll both.
1212300	1215740	Okay, so then I rerolled both and I got a 69.
1215740	1216900	That's a critical success.
1216900	1218500	That's good news.
1218500	1219740	He's back to full health.
1223000	1228000	So Stevie is like, well, the only time that I ever had
1228400	1232540	any sort of like first aid training was this one summer camp
1232540	1236740	where we just learned how to like dress like bullet wounds
1236740	1238080	in the field.
1238080	1240380	What kind of summer camp was that?
1240380	1241700	Rich people.
1242140	1242980	Oh, okay.
1242980	1244740	I'll have to do a story about that.
1245740	1246580	Good news, Stevie.
1246580	1247560	I think it's a bullet wound.
1247560	1248760	Summer's camp me.
1252220	1253060	Scamp?
1255300	1257980	He leans his shoulder towards Stevie,
1257980	1260420	points at it with the napkin sticking out of it.
1260420	1262540	So she hops out of the Mercedes C class.
1262540	1265660	She rummages through Cal's trunk.
1265660	1267500	Which has a full first aid kit probably.
1267500	1269500	Which has a full first aid kit in the back of it
1269500	1272900	and she pulls that out, goes over to Julius.
1272900	1275200	Okay, I'm gonna need you to just kind of lean up
1275200	1279060	against the car and just, you know, bite down on this.
1279060	1281940	Julius lays down and then bites on this.
1281940	1284340	You get three hit points.
1284340	1285380	Hell yes.
1285380	1286700	Nice.
1286700	1288180	What is your max, Luke?
1288180	1289020	10.
1289020	1289840	And you're at four?
1289840	1290980	It's like I never poked you.
1292740	1295140	What do you need from me, Mr. Colorado?
1295140	1297460	What does lady journalism need?
1297460	1299660	I guess we need you to watch the exits.
1299660	1301820	We can only cover so many points of entryways
1301820	1304580	to the subway to watch the meeting.
1304580	1306540	So if you can keep them, you know,
1306540	1308260	if you can take up the rear.
1308260	1309100	Subway?
1309100	1310060	Eat fresh.
1311420	1312260	We're meeting Stevie.
1312260	1313740	Julius accepts that as an answer.
1313740	1314580	He did?
1318980	1320860	He's back, baby.
1320860	1324840	We're meeting, or Stevie is meeting, the gops.
1324840	1326340	The ones who stole our footage
1326340	1327440	and she's gonna recover it.
1327440	1328280	How many?
1328280	1329420	Just the two, as far as I know.
1329420	1330260	Which ones?
1330260	1331740	As far as we know, it's the guys
1331740	1332700	that we went to the apartments of.
1332700	1335580	Richard Riley and Wilson Wiley.
1335580	1336940	Oh, okay.
1336940	1339540	Beck is still kind of side-eyeing Julius.
1339540	1342860	Not sure if he's gonna die or not.
1344580	1347180	If you don't have good medicine skills,
1347180	1350020	then yeah, you might be very much still worried about that.
1350020	1351940	But he's not bleeding.
1351940	1355620	Blood isn't coming out of the hole anymore.
1355660	1358540	Whereas before, it seemed with every heartbeat,
1358540	1361280	there was just like a little glug.
1361280	1363480	Can you look at your phone and text me back?
1363480	1364320	Yeah, absolutely.
1364320	1366740	Here's my phone, looking at it right now.
1366740	1368540	It says, do you like me, yes or no?
1370460	1371460	Luke, roll grip.
1371460	1373980	Not to lose any or gain any,
1373980	1375860	but to know whether you...
1375860	1378180	I got a 13 on a 23.
1378180	1383180	Okay, with your grip and check, you do.
1383420	1384240	I do.
1384240	1385080	Yeah.
1385380	1386220	Now we're married.
1389220	1391880	You're meeting Richard Riley and Wilson Wiley.
1391880	1393480	Yeah, because they have the footage,
1393480	1395800	so I just need it back.
1395800	1397920	And that way I can...
1397920	1399280	That way I can...
1399280	1400200	You're not gonna meet him.
1400200	1401520	Blackmail my dad.
1401520	1402720	Well, no, of course we're not gonna meet them.
1402720	1405600	We're gonna ambush them while they meet Stevie.
1405600	1406440	Yeah.
1406440	1407260	That's the plan.
1407260	1410960	Julius picks a piece of brain off his face and says,
1410960	1414120	this is as close as you're gonna get to meeting them.
1415920	1416980	Oh, shit.
1418680	1421960	Julius, what do you mean?
1421960	1422800	They're dead.
1422800	1423640	Both of them?
1424800	1425640	Yeah.
1426920	1427760	Yeah.
1427760	1431240	They were, well, they were at Cannes.
1431240	1432640	I have so many questions,
1432640	1434180	but I think the first one is,
1434180	1436480	did you get the footage back from them then?
1436480	1437520	No.
1437520	1438360	What do you mean no?
1438360	1439360	Where was the footage?
1441280	1443440	Well, I'll be honest with you.
1444440	1445800	It all went down so fast.
1445800	1447760	And then I think I just broke.
1447760	1449400	You killed them.
1449400	1450240	Yeah.
1450240	1451360	Holy shit.
1451360	1454360	And Julius is like a thousand yard stare.
1454360	1456680	You killed Tife too, right?
1456680	1457800	Yeah.
1457800	1459920	Hey, Brack, he killed Tife.
1459920	1460760	He killed...
1460760	1461600	Tife.
1461600	1462520	You killed your uncle?
1462520	1463360	Yeah.
1464760	1468320	Well, he was gonna destroy the footage too, I think.
1468320	1470120	He didn't want it out.
1470120	1471760	He didn't want it out.
1471800	1475400	I think Beck is like sort of in shock.
1475400	1476800	Like this is too much.
1476800	1477640	Do we need to roll grip or?
1477640	1479280	Yeah, if you could both roll grip.
1482840	1484520	Cow passes just fine.
1484520	1486720	20 on a 41.
1486720	1487680	I got a 69.
1487680	1489480	Holy fucking shit.
1489480	1490320	Hell yeah.
1490320	1491800	That's my first 69 in a long time.
1491800	1495240	All right, you're gonna gain a D4 of grip back.
1495240	1496080	Ooh.
1497400	1498240	That's a four.
1498240	1499080	That's a four.
1499080	1499900	Hell yeah.
1499900	1500740	Oh, nice.
1500740	1502620	It says four on every side of that.
1502620	1503460	Yeah.
1504900	1507940	Beck is able to internalize this real quick and easy.
1507940	1511540	What is this resolve that Beck has attained?
1511540	1514700	It's that, I mean, as crazy as this all is,
1514700	1518020	it's tied up some loose ends and answered some questions,
1518020	1520580	even though others are now posed.
1520580	1522780	But it's like kind of weirdly making sense.
1522780	1523620	Yeah.
1523620	1526780	So Julius, like, holy fuck, you killed him.
1527660	1529100	But you don't have the footage?
1529100	1530300	Where'd you get the gun?
1530780	1531600	Don't worry about that.
1531600	1532440	Who shot you?
1532440	1534260	Well, one of them.
1534260	1535580	It was a player, one of them.
1535580	1537140	RR or WW.
1537140	1538740	Or, or Tife?
1538740	1541300	No, Tife didn't have a gun.
1541300	1544660	And he looks even farther than a thousand yards.
1544660	1545500	Holy shit.
1548660	1549500	Could I, could I?
1549500	1550340	Wouldn't even say it.
1550340	1552120	Could I see your gun?
1552120	1552960	No.
1552960	1553780	Please?
1554660	1555500	No.
1556780	1559660	He like pulls up his shirt for a second
1559700	1564540	and flashes you and you see two guns on it, on either hip.
1564540	1565820	And then he puts his shirt back down.
1565820	1567340	Holy shit.
1567340	1568620	Okay, so.
1568620	1572300	I'm sure if we went back to the stationers,
1572300	1576160	they were meeting with Tife, you know, the cops.
1576160	1577000	Yeah.
1577000	1578980	So he was bad, right?
1578980	1580540	Yes, he was a bad man.
1580540	1582740	A bad man who hated the news.
1582740	1584660	I mean, I wasn't there, but yeah,
1584660	1586900	it sounds like you did what you had to.
1586900	1588420	I mean, they're not like bad.
1588420	1591140	I mean, they just do whatever the Godot company
1591140	1594380	wants them to do that doesn't make him like necessarily.
1594380	1596740	They follow orders without thinking, no matter what?
1596740	1598900	Exactly, yeah, like you said, yeah.
1598900	1600180	They're just following orders?
1600180	1601340	Yeah, agreed.
1601340	1602500	It's like, what's the big deal?
1602500	1603780	Can I hear that, Steve?
1603780	1605180	Oh shit.
1605180	1606360	A serious look, yeah.
1606360	1609940	Right, okay, so if the, okay, huh.
1609940	1612980	And Jeremy's like, wait, wait, okay, so like,
1614740	1615780	if all of this is happening,
1615780	1617580	do you guys need coffee or anything?
1618420	1622660	I think we will be able to grab some coffee
1622660	1625460	on our way through the door, back at the station.
1625460	1627480	Real quick, back to Stevie.
1627480	1629500	The Godot company is bad.
1629500	1631420	Not all Godot's are bad.
1631420	1632880	You're not bad, Stevie.
1634380	1637000	You could be, depending on what you choose to do.
1637000	1638780	They like smile.
1638780	1639620	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1639620	1641500	But you're not bad because you're a Godot.
1641500	1642340	Yeah, not yet.
1643860	1646780	Exactly, none of us are bad yet.
1648940	1650780	I used to be.
1650780	1651740	I used to be a good guy.
1651740	1655440	I used to be a good guy, then I went insane.
1658500	1660500	Hey, Zach, will you check your phone?
1661420	1664860	Julius is texting while you guys are talking.
1665940	1669080	If we go back to the, Julius is, I mean, like,
1669080	1672100	do people know other than Jeremy, like, this all happened?
1672100	1673380	Like, is there, is it a crime scene?
1673380	1676140	Is it, are there gonna be a lot of cops there?
1676140	1677260	He seems lost in his phone.
1677260	1679940	We've got to accept that there's probably a lot of cops
1679940	1681700	and a crime scene environment there,
1681700	1683640	but we're the perfect cover.
1683640	1685000	We're Can News.
1685000	1686000	We are Can News.
1686000	1688700	We've got to come in and cover it, you know?
1688700	1689720	That's, they'll believe that.
1689720	1691400	I'm Cal Colorado.
1691400	1693880	Do we know that the footage is there?
1693880	1695660	Stevie, were you supposed to do the handoff here
1695660	1697340	or was this money being exchanged
1697340	1699140	and then you were gonna go get the footage somewhere?
1699140	1701020	No, they were bringing the footage here.
1701020	1702140	So maybe it's on them.
1702140	1703780	I mean, it could be, it's,
1703780	1705660	if they were gonna meet you guys,
1705660	1707900	it was probably in Tife's office.
1707900	1708740	Yeah.
1708740	1709560	I mean, maybe.
1709560	1710700	I didn't look too hard.
1710700	1713900	Also, I don't know if there'll be cops there or not.
1713900	1715620	Kind of depends.
1715620	1718260	And he's like staring at his phone, waiting for-
1718260	1720980	Depends on what, Julius?
1720980	1722860	Okay, this is the last one I'm sending.
1722860	1724200	Julius says.
1726200	1729520	Okay, Julius, like, is staring at his phone for a while
1729520	1731820	and you see it kind of deeing.
1731820	1732780	Synesthesia.
1732780	1733940	Yeah, I got synesthesia.
1733940	1735380	I heard your pussy stink.
1735940	1737180	I can't do it.
1740060	1743260	Guys, I, I want to tell you-
1743260	1744100	That's just a tweet.
1744100	1745660	I didn't make that up or anything.
1747420	1748740	That would have been nuts.
1748740	1750760	Yeah, I'm not that good.
1750760	1753660	Guys, I want to, I want to tell you something,
1753660	1758540	but if I tell you, it's nothing's ever gonna be the same.
1758540	1760580	And you don't take it lightly.
1761580	1766540	I, I don't, but nothing's been the same
1766540	1768900	for a couple days now.
1769820	1770660	You know what I mean?
1770660	1772380	Yeah, I think we were past samesies.
1772380	1775540	Yeah, the It Pit pretty much did it in for that.
1775540	1776500	Okay, well.
1778860	1781020	Well, do you, I, you know,
1781020	1783420	I don't normally carry guns around, right?
1783420	1784260	I wasn't sure.
1784260	1785100	Yeah, yeah, no, no.
1785100	1786740	You didn't really seem like a big gun guy before,
1786740	1789780	except for, you know, those cannons
1789820	1792540	and your, and your, that you call thighs.
1792540	1796060	Right, I've had these, I've had these guns a long time.
1796060	1797700	You are a gun guy.
1797700	1800620	Well, I have to be in my line of work.
1800620	1802300	Beck is just staring at you.
1802300	1804700	What, what, what's your line of work, son?
1805940	1807780	Well, it's technically government.
1811020	1816020	I work for, it's like maybe kind of like the FBI,
1816900	1821900	but for, you know, the shit we've seen the past few days.
1824100	1824940	Extreme.
1827820	1831660	Basically, that's, that's the closest I'd compare it to.
1832740	1835500	I don't know, I just have a connection that,
1835500	1839220	that pays me and tells me to, to do things and...
1840980	1842380	Can I, can I human this?
1842380	1843220	Yeah.
1843220	1844060	70 on a 70.
1845060	1845900	How does he feel?
1845900	1847860	Do you think he's telling the truth?
1847860	1850260	You know, Julius, you've had a really tough day
1850260	1852620	and I believe that you believe
1852620	1857620	that you're in the X-Files or whatever, but yeah.
1857620	1860420	I mean, so why don't we just get back to the can building
1860420	1863180	and try to find the footage?
1863180	1868180	And we can talk all about your little alien adventures
1868340	1869180	or whatever.
1869180	1871020	Okay, well, just so we know,
1871020	1876020	you guys are kinda, I mean, kinda in now too, in on it.
1876220	1878260	So don't tell anybody.
1878260	1879980	Are you, Julius, are you telling me
1879980	1881900	that you have like an assignment?
1881900	1882740	What do you, yeah.
1882740	1885260	Do you know more about what's going on than we do?
1885260	1888820	Well, I know that we need that footage
1888820	1892380	and I need to kill Gops.
1894380	1895980	We agreed we need that footage.
1895980	1897900	What do you want the footage for?
1898140	1898980	Same reason you do.
1898980	1900540	To show to the world.
1900540	1901380	Yes.
1901380	1902700	I want to human that.
1902700	1903540	Roll it, baby.
1903540	1904380	Nice.
1904380	1905700	36.
1905700	1906940	How does he feel?
1907940	1909780	Julius is telling the truth.
1909780	1911540	Fuck yeah, baby.
1911540	1912780	Holy shit.
1912780	1913620	Okay.
1914620	1919020	We find the footage and we put it out on the TikTok.
1919020	1921780	Yeah, are you like a real producer too though?
1921780	1925660	Beck sees Julius texting they need that footage.
1925660	1929660	Beck sees Julius texting they know and sending it.
1931900	1934980	Well, Ty was my uncle,
1934980	1939460	but no, I never had any real training.
1939460	1942980	It was, I mean, I'm lucky that he was my uncle.
1942980	1944620	That's how I got the job, but.
1944620	1946860	Well, we, yeah, we all knew that part.
1946860	1948340	Probably could have clocked that a little sooner,
1948340	1949460	you're right, yeah.
1949460	1951700	No, no, no, I mean, that was, yeah.
1951700	1954620	But at the end of the day, I feel like I, you know,
1954620	1956860	I have the same kind of heart that you guys do.
1956860	1958100	I want the truth.
1958100	1960340	I want people to know the truth.
1960340	1963900	Well, at least enough truth that they won't, you know,
1963900	1964740	go nuts.
1966620	1967940	You mean the whole truth?
1967940	1969140	In a lot of cases.
1970180	1973380	In this case, we just rolled about this.
1974260	1976740	Yeah, Julius, yes.
1978940	1981380	Definitely in this case.
1981380	1983220	Julius text.
1983220	1984860	Julius, who are you texting?
1984860	1988900	We can call her X for X file.
1990060	1994340	If that's, you know, that's the easiest way to refer to it.
1994340	1997340	Have you ever met X in real life?
1999060	2002220	Yeah, she's my roommate.
2002220	2003060	Oh shit.
2004900	2006860	Okay, so like, but this is like a source
2006860	2008260	that wants to remain anonymous.
2008260	2010020	What's her real name?
2010020	2011540	We'll need to get clearance to interview her
2011540	2012940	and everything for this.
2013580	2015340	I don't know that that'll be happening,
2015340	2017700	but I do have good news.
2018580	2019980	She's got the footage.
2019980	2021340	X has the footage?
2021340	2022940	She just texted me.
2022940	2024940	Like at your place?
2024940	2026420	Is X gonna give it to us?
2026420	2027260	What?
2027260	2028100	Ha ha.
2028100	2028940	Pfft.
2028940	2029780	Pfft.
2029780	2030620	Ha ha ha.
2030620	2031460	Pfft.
2031460	2032300	Ha ha ha.
2032300	2033140	Ha ha ha.
2033140	2033980	Ha ha ha.
2033980	2034820	Ha ha ha.
2034820	2035660	Ha ha ha.
2035660	2036500	Ha ha ha.
2036500	2037340	Ha ha ha.
2037340	2038180	Ha ha ha.
2038220	2040140	And it's all my fault.
2042540	2044380	Is that enough to be the end of the episode?
2044380	2045220	That's the end, right?
2045220	2046060	That's the end.
2046060	2047100	Unfortunately for...
2047100	2048580	We're doing two episodes, so.
2051020	2052340	Was that enough time?
2052340	2053980	It's like 50 minutes.
2053980	2055180	Oh, all together?
2055180	2056020	Yeah.
2056020	2057660	So it ended down to like 30?
2057660	2059860	No, like easy 42.
2059860	2060700	33.
2060700	2062620	So unfortunately that can't be the end.
2062620	2063540	Yeah, sorry Joe.
2063540	2064380	Ha ha ha.
2066380	2069060	You should end it there and then have like
2069060	2072220	still like 20 more minutes of episode after.
2072220	2075420	Play the music and then here's the rest of the episode.
2075420	2076260	Yeah.
2077940	2080980	You can, yeah, just like play the first 10 seconds.
2080980	2082060	Not a full fucking song.
2082060	2084140	Nobody would listen to it.
2084140	2085060	Two seconds.
2086780	2089500	Yeah, I think she's gonna give it to us.
2090380	2091220	And he...
2093780	2094940	X?
2094940	2097780	X gonna give it to us.
2097780	2102780	But he texts back a house emoji or Z, question mark.
2104980	2106540	The house.
2106540	2109580	Okay, you guys wanna see my house?
2109580	2110500	What's Z?
2110500	2112460	Secret meeting spot.
2112460	2114140	Oh, for your little alien club?
2115620	2116460	It's, well...
2116460	2118500	What are you guys, like an internet discussion group
2118500	2119540	or something or?
2119540	2120700	Do you have like training?
2120700	2122220	Did somebody train you?
2122220	2123060	Peck.
2124260	2125540	Come on.
2125540	2126380	I mean...
2128180	2129940	I'll tell you guys the full story later
2129940	2133020	but I mean, unless you wanna hear it right now.
2133020	2134100	Ha ha ha ha.
2137180	2138540	Yeah, tell it to us on the way.
2138540	2139380	Okay.
2139380	2140220	This is perfect.
2140220	2141980	Okay, so what cars are going where?
2141980	2143420	Where is Jeremy going?
2143420	2145940	Beck is FaceTiming Julius
2145940	2149060	who is in Jeremy's car following behind us.
2149060	2150180	Or no, we're following them
2150180	2151700	because you've gotta lead us to your house.
2152540	2153380	Who am I in the car with?
2153380	2155140	You're FaceTiming from Jeremy's car
2155140	2155980	and you're only in the car with Jeremy.
2155980	2157620	You're back in your bloody seat.
2159540	2160380	Clark.
2162220	2164020	Beck is getting the...
2166260	2168540	Beck is putting the phone on,
2168540	2170180	like trying to balance it on the dashboard
2170180	2173180	while he rummages around for like Arby's napkins
2173180	2175780	to start wiping the vomit off of him.
2175780	2177500	Oh yeah, yeah.
2177500	2179740	Oh, were you sick?
2179740	2181180	It's not mine, Cal.
2182020	2184340	I poked Julius in his gunshot wound
2184340	2186180	because he didn't think it was a gunshot wound
2186180	2188140	and I was trying to show him it was a gunshot wound
2188140	2190180	and when I did that, he threw up on me.
2190180	2191220	Checks out.
2191220	2192060	Cal just...
2192060	2193300	Julius says over FaceTime.
2194300	2195420	Cal just kind of blinks
2195420	2198020	and turns his eyes back to the road.
2198020	2201300	Well, I mean, yes.
2203940	2206260	It started when I was in high school
2206260	2209100	and then the screen fades away.
2209100	2209940	Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope.
2209940	2212820	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2212820	2215100	We see Julius Summers as a teenager
2215100	2217780	wearing a black and white track and field uniform
2217780	2221500	with the suburb sharks emblazoned on the front.
2221500	2224020	We see clips of him talking and smiling with friends
2224020	2225940	and teammates interspersed between highlights
2225940	2229060	of his sprinting, pole vaulting, high and long jumping.
2229060	2231380	Whoa, Julie, you jumped so high.
2231380	2233820	It cuts to Julius on top of a podium
2233820	2236860	wearing multiple gold medals and holding flowers.
2236860	2239500	Julius is surrounded by his friends and fans
2239500	2241980	and being showered with congratulations and praise.
2241980	2243700	His thighs are so big.
2243700	2244540	Eventually the crowd...
2244540	2246620	That's how I jump so much.
2246620	2249140	Eventually the crowd thins out as the event wraps up.
2249140	2250780	The other teens head home with their parents
2250780	2251900	or older siblings.
2251900	2253980	And eventually Julius stands completely alone
2253980	2256460	near the pickup lane at the high school.
2256460	2258340	He flags down someone walking to their car
2258340	2260020	and asked to use their cell phone.
2260020	2263180	Julius dials a number and holds the phone up to his ear.
2263180	2265860	Hey mom, are you...
2265860	2266980	Oh, okay.
2267900	2269540	Yeah, I won.
2270700	2273780	Yeah, okay, I'll just walk home.
2273780	2274700	See you tonight?
2275860	2277420	Julius hands the phone back.
2277420	2279620	Politely declines a ride home
2279620	2282620	and begins to walk the four miles to his mom's house.
2282620	2283860	About three miles down the road,
2283860	2285220	Julius steps off the pavement
2285220	2286980	toward an overgrown path in the woods,
2286980	2289420	a shortcut he's taken a thousand times.
2289420	2290940	About 50 feet onto the trail,
2290940	2294860	Julius hears a twig snap and a low gravelly voice.
2294860	2296300	Nice race.
2296340	2298060	Julius spins around to look at a man
2298060	2300180	in a tight, ratty black suit,
2300180	2303060	dark aviator sunglasses and worn combat boots
2303060	2306060	with thin waist-length pitch black hair
2306060	2307740	leaning up against a tree.
2307740	2309900	Julius's stomach jumps to his throat
2309900	2311820	as he manages to squeak out.
2311820	2312980	Yeah, thanks.
2314140	2315820	I've been watching you.
2315820	2318500	We've been watching you,
2318500	2319980	rooting for you,
2319980	2324300	keeping track of all your accomplishments and failures.
2325300	2326820	You're good.
2326820	2329100	Almost as good as some of our guys.
2331180	2333100	What the fuck are you talking about?
2334220	2335260	Come here.
2335260	2337140	Let me get a closer look.
2338020	2339660	Let me,
2339660	2341260	let me feel your strength.
2342980	2344340	Get the fuck away from me!
2345500	2348180	Okay, damn, we're gonna have to play it this way, huh?
2348180	2350860	Well, I'll give you a head start.
2351980	2353340	Julius stares at the man.
2353380	2356180	He notices how unevenly shaved the man's face is.
2356180	2357940	A patch of three or four hairs
2357940	2360140	inches longer than his five o'clock shadow
2360140	2362100	protrudes from his chin.
2362100	2365500	The man raises his hand up to stroke the longer hairs.
2365500	2367140	Five,
2367140	2367980	four,
2368980	2370380	three.
2370380	2372980	The man ever so slightly flicks his sunglasses down,
2372980	2374420	looks over them at Julius
2374420	2376980	and motions his head toward the trail.
2376980	2378260	Go, Mr. Summers.
2379660	2382580	Julius takes off sprinting towards safety.
2382660	2383780	Two.
2383780	2385180	He hurdles over fallen limbs,
2385180	2387300	rusted scrap metal and loose rocks.
2387300	2390860	His vision narrows as his flight response fully kicks in.
2390860	2391740	One.
2391740	2393580	Julius hears quick heavy footsteps
2393580	2395100	begin falling behind him.
2395100	2396900	He can almost see the end of the tree line
2396900	2399420	that opens up into the back of his neighborhood.
2399420	2403100	Looks like I'll be taking those medals today, boy.
2403940	2406980	Julius falls to the ground as he's tackled from behind.
2406980	2409500	His face is shoved into the mud as his legs
2409500	2411340	and hands are zip tied behind him.
2411340	2412660	The man flips over onto his back.
2412660	2414740	Can you say that again real quick?
2414740	2416140	His face is shoved into the mud.
2416140	2418060	The fact was so close.
2418060	2420940	Julius falls to the ground as he is tackled from behind.
2420940	2423100	His face is shoved into the mud as his legs
2423100	2425220	and hands are zip tied behind him.
2425220	2428420	The man flips over onto his back and stands over him.
2428420	2430380	We'll get you in proper shape.
2430380	2431260	Trust me, bud.
2432420	2434460	The screen goes dark as the man's foot comes down
2434460	2435780	on Julius's face.
2435780	2440780	And then, yeah, pretty much just training every day.
2445780	2449260	And then they tell me to do something and I do it.
2449260	2451860	Did they ever tell you who they were?
2454220	2456020	As far as you guys are concerned,
2456020	2458740	for now they're X-Files and I'm X-Files.
2458740	2460540	Wait, these are your nerd friends?
2461300	2462140	Yeah.
2465460	2466940	Sure, Cal.
2466940	2471940	No, wait, that, that heroine story felt very real.
2473460	2478460	This is the, you're, son of a bitch, you're an X-Files.
2478580	2479420	I am.
2479420	2484420	There's like a look of like relief and a resolve in Beck
2484900	2486980	because it's all fucking real.
2486980	2488860	He fucking knew it.
2488860	2490660	Fuck yeah, fuck yeah.
2490660	2492180	Cal vomits in Beck's lap.
2494620	2496300	I'm gonna need some more of those napkins.
2496300	2498380	Julius looks over at Jeremy.
2498380	2499940	I guess you're in now, too.
2501500	2504340	Jeremy's eyes are so fucking big, dude.
2506380	2507220	That's an ep.
2507220	2508060	Sweet.
2508060	2509140	That's fucking dope, dude.
2509180	2513020	It's great and it's all my fault
2514980	2519980	because my life is great
2519980	2521940	and it's all mine
2529540	2534500	because my life is great
2534500	2536780	and it's all my fault
2539140	2544140	because my life is great
