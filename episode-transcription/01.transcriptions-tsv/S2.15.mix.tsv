0	3760	Hello, all of my sweet little ones.
3760	8240	It's your caretaker from another dimension, Wolf the Dog.
8240	12880	And I'm here to nuzzle you until you grow big and strong
12880	17120	and become capable of great and grand things.
17120	20880	Then you can repay me bit by bit
20880	26320	with just a little teeny tiny bit of your life force.
26320	27680	Just a little bit.
27680	32400	You won't even notice it, I promise, until you do.
32400	38800	And I am sapping y'all live from 694.2 PTBP,
38800	42560	the radio station that you listen to,
42560	45440	the only one that makes sounds at night
45440	48240	to drive away the old ones.
48240	51680	Sometimes y'all write me things, and this time,
51680	53360	I guess I'll read it.
53360	56560	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Jaron
56560	58960	in Springfield, Oregon,
58960	62720	the real Springfield the Simpsons was based on,
62720	67040	who wrote up a lovingly sopping five-star review
67040	69920	on their podcast app of choice,
69920	73600	which is a nice way to support this podcast that you like
73600	75760	and are currently listening to.
75760	77440	Well done, Jaron.
77440	79600	Never heard of any Simpsons,
79600	82320	so not sure what you're on about.
82320	84160	Jaron writes,
112320	115360	Well, we've been talking about this entire time.
115360	119200	The password to get in will be fuck the zuck.
119200	120480	See you there.
120480	124080	P.S. Keep up the good work, my guys.
124080	127440	My favorite RPG podcast by far.
127440	129360	Just became the proud owner
129360	133040	of a Splashylvania Fastpass myself.
133040	136480	Well, thanks, Jaron from Oregon,
136480	139840	but I'll be declining your invitation
139840	146640	because I am far too busy taking care of Wolf the dog,
146640	148640	my dog, Wolf the dog.
148640	152560	I also finally figured out what the internet is.
152560	155360	It's an interdimensional net
155360	160240	used for catching the plasma carp from the galactic streams.
161120	162720	Yeah, I know things.
162720	163920	I guess you could say
163920	167920	I'm a little bit of an internet expert myself.
167920	169520	If you want to ride up something
169520	171840	for your big, bad Wolfie to hell,
171840	175520	tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram.
175520	178240	Tag pretending to be people on Facebook
178240	180320	or write up a five star review
180320	182960	on the podcast app of your choice.
182960	186080	Screenshot that absolute gift
186080	191040	and send it on for Wolfie to see and smell and taste.
193920	195600	And if you want to support this show
195600	198880	and unlock 37 bonus episodes,
198880	202320	all while getting us closer and closer to our goal
202320	205920	of getting back to the weekly releases that you crave,
205920	210480	head on over to patreon.com slash pretending pod.
210480	213120	Now, in fact, you can find us
213120	217360	on a few different places on the internet for merch
217360	219520	or to listen to the soundtrack
219520	223440	or to engage with this nasty community.
223440	226320	You're gonna want to go to the show notes.
226320	229120	How many times have you heard me say that?
229120	230800	A bunch, I bet.
230800	232960	And have you ever clicked in
232960	235520	and actually looked at those little links
236080	240080	or the little episode blurb that my producer writes up
240080	244320	for every single one of these episodes?
244320	247360	It takes him so long to type up.
247360	249040	You should cherish it.
249040	250320	Admire it.
250320	251600	I know I do.
252160	255440	Well, either way, it's time for the news.
256160	261360	Last time, our intrepid heroes used each other's strength
261360	265680	and the limp body of Vernon Covington, the landlord,
265680	268320	to escape from the It Pit.
268320	270800	And when they finally got out,
270800	274880	Beck Wilder couldn't move on until Cal Colorado
274880	278720	and Julia Summers removed their jackets?
278720	280320	Hmm, weird.
280320	283520	The can crew then crept quickly through the woods
283520	286560	on the far east side of Grover's Gorge,
286560	290400	heading south until they met the enormous plant wall.
290400	295200	Lush, verdant, and apparently quite easy to maneuver within
295200	297520	without starting a commotion.
297520	301840	There was, however, a commotion in Grover's Gorge
301840	305920	due to the sloshingly soaked current mayor,
305920	310480	Chuck Bidwell, walking confidently south through the town.
310480	313120	The team from City Action News
313120	315360	slinked out the metal hatch door
315360	319360	and backed toward Godel's Gate to Grover's Gorge,
319360	322720	the single, simple, steel-trained car
322720	325200	that crosses the foggy crevasse
325200	329920	with the unnaturally smooth cliff face on either side
329920	332800	and a church stuck upside down
332880	337760	where it fell into this chasm so many years ago.
337760	338960	You know what?
338960	342560	Y'all deserve a brand new theme song,
342560	345680	a fresh jam, if you will.
345680	349440	Let's unwrap this tasty snack together.
349440	352720	It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great
352720	355040	and it's all my fault.
355040	358640	It's all my fault
358640	363680	Cause my life is great
363680	365680	And it's all mine
373120	378080	Cause my life is great
378080	380960	And it's all my fault
385040	391120	What about my hair?
391120	395280	Oh. Oh, yeah, it caught on fire.
395280	398320	Joe lit his face on fire.
398320	400160	It's cool. We'll post it on social media.
400160	400720	It's dope.
400720	402560	Yeah, go to our social media right now
402560	405040	if you don't follow us or if you do
405040	410480	and check out a fun video of Joe's face catching a blaze.
410480	413520	It's just a party trick I do sometimes,
413520	414720	specifically on camera.
415280	416320	Yeah, it's important.
418000	419040	It really went up, didn't it?
421040	422720	Do you put anything in your beard?
422720	423040	Nope.
423040	424320	Yeah, gasoline.
424320	426800	It went up very quickly.
426800	428320	It looked like it had an accelerant in it,
428320	428960	but it doesn't.
428960	430240	It's just dry and brittle.
430240	432240	I hadn't smelled burnt hair in a long time
432240	433360	and that was crazy.
433360	436320	Yeah, then we smelt it for a while.
436320	437600	I think I just got used to it
437600	439520	because I'm like, oh, it's gone
439520	441040	and then go outside and come back in.
441040	443040	I'm like, oh, it definitely smells like burnt hair.
443440	444800	I was smelling it the next day.
446480	448720	That's because there was still burnt hair on your face.
448720	449200	Yep.
449200	450080	How does it feel?
451120	451520	It's fine.
451520	454400	It's 100% fine, except that I did singe my eyelashes
454400	457920	and they feel weird still, but they're going to be fine.
457920	458560	Like crusty?
458560	460480	I've done that smoke in a bowl before.
460480	461840	Hey, same.
463520	466640	The whole front of my hair went up on New Year's Eve one year
466640	468000	when I was standing outside.
468000	468960	It was real windy.
468960	471600	I've only curled my eyelashes, but that's impressive.
471600	473120	Oh, I got the whole thing.
473120	475120	And the first thought that I had,
475120	477200	cause I didn't even smell it,
477200	480160	but I looked at myself in a mirror later and always
480720	485120	and I was like, did I get like Cheeto puff in my hair?
485120	485760	Like dust?
487040	488160	It was orange?
488160	491440	It was like a little, I guess cause I have like brownish hair.
491440	493600	I had like brownish hair.
493600	495520	I know I actually can picture the...
496560	498800	The curly Q crusties.
498800	500640	New Year's 01 was crazy.
502320	504960	Everybody thought, you know, Y2K was going to end it all
506320	507120	the year before.
509760	511520	He was still talking about it though.
511520	515600	Oh, so you guys just pass through the door?
515600	517440	The door?
517440	518560	The SpongeBob portal.
518560	520080	The SpongeBob portal door.
520080	523280	Well, I did some research on what those doors are called.
523280	524000	Nice.
524000	524560	Yeah.
524560	525920	And apparently...
525920	527360	And now you're voting Republican.
527360	532880	You would believe the insane restrictions
533520	537280	that the fucking libs have put on the big ass door industry.
538240	539120	What did you learn?
539120	541200	The entrances are called doors.
542720	543360	Wait, wait, wait.
543360	548160	Like the, the watertight things that come together are called dogs.
548880	549680	Dows.
550240	550800	Dogs.
550800	551280	Where?
551280	553040	The watertight things that come together.
553040	553440	So like the seal.
553440	554800	You mean like the helical like...
554800	557120	The cams is what I'm reading on the internet.
557120	562400	This is a former US Submariner typing on Reddit.
562400	563040	What was that?
563040	564400	Submariner.
564400	565200	Whatever.
565200	569120	And they said dog the door.
570800	573680	Yeah, that just means, I think that means secure it, right?
573680	577120	Spin the wheel to engage the cams in the closed position.
577680	578640	Like the pins.
578640	579520	The pins.
579520	580880	So it's not called the dog.
580880	584320	Yeah, that's clearly a verb.
584320	584960	Okay.
584960	586800	So the pins that like lock it into place?
587120	590160	But not the door itself, which is what you just said earlier.
590160	591520	It's called a door, I think.
591520	593200	And then the parts around are dogs.
593200	594400	So dog the doors.
594400	596160	I adore with my dogs.
596160	597200	I adore my dogs.
598480	598880	Nice.
598880	599200	Y'all.
600960	601600	A dog door.
602160	604400	See, that just opens up more confusion now.
604400	607360	Cause when you say dog door, we're going to all start crawling.
607360	607860	Yeah.
608320	609440	I'm crawling right now.
610880	611440	On the train?
612080	612560	Very good.
612560	613200	Let's go there.
613200	620160	Cal Colorado, Beck Wilder, Julius Summers, and Stevie are all standing in a simple steel
620160	626240	single train car sized train station on an unnecessarily massive bridge, 20 meters tall
626240	628320	and 100 meters long.
628320	634560	This bridge that crosses this enormous massive ravine is a minimalist construction showcasing
634560	642080	the steel that seems to be your only way back over this deep, wide, and foggy ravine.
642080	647040	The fog seems to be growing thicker and taller with every second.
647040	653120	And soon it will be a wall that this simple steel single train car will need to penetrate
653120	654800	to get to the other side.
654800	658560	The creaking hatch-like submarine looking door that leads back.
663040	664880	Zach, we were going to just let penetrate fly.
664880	668640	Did you want us to, uh, where did you have a beat written in there?
668640	669280	No, no.
669280	670640	It says and standing.
675040	676720	So there's a, there's a hatch.
676720	677760	Pause for the boys.
677760	679040	Pause for the dirty boys.
679040	680720	Pause for the dirty boys.
682320	684160	And a sopping wet.
684160	685600	Is this the kind of hat you can dog?
685600	692960	Chug Bidwell in his snug, now snugger green, now darker green polo steps confidently through
692960	694880	the door, just dripping.
694880	699360	Suddenly Stevie, their eyes get huge with realization.
699360	700720	Holy fucking shit.
701600	705520	There's no backup for the backup mayor.
705520	712480	And she begins like she's going to sprint out of the train car toward the soggy current
712480	714400	mayor of Grover's gorge.
714400	716480	We're going to move in dexterity order.
716480	719760	They were in the car with us and now they are sprinting out of the car.
719760	722960	They are about to start sprinting, but we're going to go into decks order.
722960	726000	So if one of you has higher decks than Stevie.
726000	727840	But their intention is to leave the car?
727840	729920	Their intention is to leave the car.
729920	730480	Yep.
730480	733760	As they holler out, holy fucking shit.
733760	736640	There's no backup for the backup mayor.
737360	739200	What happens if there's no mayor?
739760	742880	God gets loose, I guess.
742880	744640	And we got to go dexterity.
744640	745200	Who's got what?
745200	746080	75.
746080	747520	Oh, you're definitely going first.
747520	748080	50.
748080	748960	50 and?
748960	749600	45.
749600	750160	45.
750160	755360	So it's going to go Julia Summers, Stevie, and then down the line, we got Beck, Beck
755360	757520	Wilder, Cal Colorado, Julia Summers.
757520	758000	What do you do?
758000	759600	He grasps at them.
759600	759840	Okay.
763680	764640	What do you want me to roll?
767120	768960	I'd like you to roll on armed combat.
768960	769760	Yeah, I don't win.
775120	776480	Stevie rolled a success.
776480	778320	I rolled an 83 on a 60.
778320	779120	That's not going to do it.
779200	786080	So as you reach out and grasp for Stevie, they dip out and take off running off out of this
786720	794400	single steel, simple train car sized simple train station and toward the sopping wet current
794400	796160	mayor of Grover's Gorge.
796160	797600	It is Beck Wilder's turn.
798480	804160	Beck, we've all resigned ourselves to trying to get the fuck out of here.
804160	806480	I don't think that he's on the train.
806480	808960	He's just going to go to the door and yell out to them.
809680	812320	Stevie, dude, we got to go.
813280	816160	We can maybe install a new mayor when we get back or something.
816160	817360	Would that be helpful?
817360	818160	We need to leave.
818160	820640	No, it's got to happen now.
820640	826880	Cal kind of brushes past Beck and he can't run very fast, but he's, you know, bad left
826880	827120	knee.
828320	835440	But yeah, he's starting to chase after Stevie and he's shouting, Stevie, I don't think this
835440	836320	is very prudent.
836320	839040	Have you really considered if this is the best course of action?
839040	840720	Why don't you just wait up a minute there?
840720	841760	Hold on, Stevie.
841760	843280	I'm really serious, guys.
843280	844880	This is very serious.
845600	851280	You can roll persuade both of you combined and you can combine your role against her.
851280	853760	Can I have said no, don't go and also roll?
855680	857920	I fail mine a 65 on a 50.
859600	862080	I also rolled a 65 on a 80.
863600	864100	Nice.
864960	865600	Very good.
865600	871440	So you are giving it your all, but I gave her a plus 20 because you had a predetermined
871440	872080	outcome in mind.
873280	878160	I gave her a plus 20 because the thing that she knows is very stout.
879200	881040	And I gave her a 50.
881040	881520	What did she roll?
881520	882080	For a human.
882720	883680	Luke, what did she roll?
886800	888000	A critical fail.
888000	889440	77 on a 70.
890480	892640	So she stops dead in her tracks.
892640	893920	I think you're getting through to it, man.
893920	895600	They turn around, they look at Cal.
895600	898080	Well, now I'm not sure if stopping them was even a good idea.
901360	904720	Wait, why did you want to, what were you going to do?
909440	909940	Okay.
910720	918160	Sopping wet, Chuck Bidwell is just walking confidently, carefully, and slowly toward
918160	922240	the edge of the cliff with one eye kind of looking over.
922240	928320	He's kind of glancing over Stevie, giving her a very dirty eyes.
928320	929360	Where's the other eye looking?
929360	931680	Now, both of them, both of them together, one of them and the other one.
931680	932240	Two eyes.
933840	935600	He's got two eyes on Stevie.
936880	942480	And he's just walking away and walking toward the edge of the cliff while you guys, they've
942480	944480	turned around and they look at you.
944480	946400	Well, Julius, you're right there too, right?
946400	946800	Yeah.
946800	948640	Now I feel like I've made a mistake.
948640	950000	Should you run after him, Stevie?
952400	957520	Um, cut that part out.
958080	959840	Chuck Bidwell continues to walk.
959840	961360	She still hasn't answered my question.
961360	967040	If we don't stop him from jumping off this cliff and hitting himself, he will be unleashed.
967040	968480	He's been trying to do this the whole time.
968480	969600	That's why he's the mayor.
969600	975040	It's this weird, some sort of fucking spell or some shit that's actually real where he's
975040	979760	the mayor and he stays the mayor and it stays the mayor as long as there's a mayor.
979760	983280	But if he dies, there's no mayor and it's loose on everyone.
983280	984880	They put it in the turtle.
984880	985840	Turtles are slow.
985840	987520	And they live for a long time.
987520	988080	Yeah.
988080	989920	And they typically don't kill themselves.
989920	990320	Yeah.
990320	990960	Yeah.
990960	991760	God turtle.
991760	992080	God.
992080	993120	God turtle.
993120	993920	Stevie should go.
993920	994880	Stevie, go get him.
1003360	1004720	Whatever you say.
1004720	1006880	And she, and she turns around.
1007440	1010560	She turns around.
1010560	1011440	You got it, boss.
1014160	1017600	Stevie plants their heels into the ground.
1018160	1019520	She takes off.
1019520	1022960	Oh, by the way, Stevie uses just like she, they pronouns.
1022960	1025600	So either one that you decide to use is fine.
1025600	1026000	Word.
1026000	1026480	Oh, cool.
1026480	1026880	Tight.
1026880	1033520	And when Stevie collides with the wet polo clad Chuck Bidwell, Stevie is trying to hold
1033520	1037040	on and restrain Chuck Bidwell from walking any further.
1037040	1043440	However, Chuck Bidwell continues his gate as Stevie continues to plant her heels into
1043440	1045760	the ground and they're just trying to hold on.
1045760	1051440	So at this point, because of the dilly dallying, you've got one roll.
1051440	1052720	You've only got one roll.
1052720	1054080	Do not let it pass you by.
1056320	1057520	The classic crap.
1057520	1065040	Julius is gonna realize what they said and sprint and try to knock him backwards away
1065040	1066080	from the gorge.
1066080	1067440	Okay, go ahead and roll.
1068240	1069040	Roll what?
1069040	1071040	Because he's just walking slowly.
1071040	1074240	You can just roll strength if that's higher than unarmed combat.
1074240	1076320	I'll do an unarmed combat.
1076320	1077360	Cause you're trying to push.
1079200	1081200	I got a 31 on a 60.
1081200	1083280	Got a 52 on a 70.
1083920	1084420	Damn.
1084800	1091040	So you go to push onto the front and these thighs, man, what's going on with them?
1091040	1094400	They're tired from squeezing the life out of Vernon.
1094400	1104720	These thighs of mine, they're tired of squashing.
1104720	1106880	Tired from pushing Vernon.
1106880	1112720	Julius is just a little worn out from, you know, he basically maxed out at the gym today.
1113520	1114640	On Vernon's head.
1117040	1121920	And now you are just trying to hold on, but Chuck Bidwell continues.
1122640	1126320	Darth Vader like walk toward this edge.
1126320	1127360	Darth Vader win.
1127360	1129280	Oh, um, 92.
1131040	1131680	Oh yeah.
1131680	1132320	The Olympics.
1134640	1135360	Atlanta?
1135360	1136080	Come on.
1136080	1136800	96.
1136800	1137600	Whatever.
1137600	1143520	And Colorado, uh, Beck Wilder has.
1144080	1148320	Zach's referencing when he saw him walking in a parade one time in 1992.
1149680	1150880	That was the Darth Vader walk.
1150880	1151280	Uh huh.
1151280	1151600	Yeah.
1151600	1153040	Thanksgiving, the year I was born.
1153040	1154560	He wasn't allowed in the parade.
1154560	1156000	So people were trying to hold him back.
1157040	1160640	That Darth Vader walked with such strength and vigor.
1160640	1161360	Beck Wilder.
1161360	1162640	I'm doing the same thing.
1162640	1166880	Stevie has convinced me that I've already seen this crazy shit happen.
1167040	1168800	And I don't want more of that.
1168800	1171280	And it sounds like it's going to be real bad if I do.
1171280	1176480	So he wants to, uh, I want to go over there and try and help block like a, is it a frontline
1176480	1176800	man?
1176800	1176960	Yeah.
1176960	1178800	Like an offensive lineman offensive lineman.
1178800	1180400	I want to, I want to kind of get into stance.
1180400	1180560	Okay.
1180560	1182800	Now are you doing pass blocking or brush blocking?
1182800	1186000	So pass blocking is going to be kind of on your heels, trying to keep them in front of
1186000	1188960	you and rush blocking is going to be driving the group forward.
1188960	1192320	Rush, rush blocking, rush blocking, trying to maybe even get them to the ground.
1192320	1194560	Once I, once I center mass him.
1194560	1194960	Yeah.
1194960	1198000	Like one of the greatest offensive linemen of all time.
1198000	1199120	Orlando pace.
1199120	1199920	That's what I was thinking.
1199920	1200320	Yeah.
1200320	1200720	Yeah.
1200720	1201120	Yeah.
1201120	1202640	And you just lumber over there.
1202640	1208000	He was like 300 pounds and quicker in 15 yards than Marshall folk.
1208000	1208560	No shit.
1208560	1209360	2000.
1209360	1210240	Yeah dude.
1210240	1210800	That's cool.
1210800	1211840	Wildly fast.
1211840	1212960	Explosive.
1212960	1214400	Explosive.
1214400	1215440	A lot, a lot like Beck.
1217280	1218160	300 pounds.
1218160	1219360	I don't know what I was rolling on.
1219360	1220080	Was it good?
1220080	1220720	But it's good.
1223040	1224480	Well, what are you trying to use?
1224880	1229200	I mean, it's either strength or I don't know, like athletics.
1229200	1230400	Let's go strength.
1230400	1231840	21 on a 55.
1231840	1232160	Okay.
1232160	1233280	Chuck, but it all failed.
1233280	1234160	Oh shit.
1234160	1234560	Yeah.
1234560	1236000	78 over 70.
1236000	1237440	Then yeah, I'm driving him back.
1237440	1241120	I don't know if it's strong enough to knock him down, but I'm at least digging in my heels
1241120	1242320	and he, he was not moving forward.
1242320	1247760	You have stopped the progress of Chuck Bidwell and it is Cal Colorado's turn.
1247760	1248480	Dope, dope, dope.
1248480	1251440	When he comes, he comes panting up like a little out of breath.
1252080	1258160	And I think he just like grabs on to Julius's shoulders and yanks back and brings like the
1258160	1259120	whole group with them.
1259120	1259440	Love it.
1259440	1260000	Go ahead and roll.
1261760	1264400	Hopefully you bring the whole group with you in a good way.
1264400	1265520	What would you like me to roll?
1265520	1268640	The same thing as them, either a strength or an unarmed combat.
1268640	1271200	Pass a strength roll with 21.
1271200	1273280	I've got you beat with a 26.
1273280	1275280	Ooh, a close one.
1275280	1276320	Very close.
1276320	1280000	Well, now I'm embarrassed that I said the, the thing.
1281520	1282880	The thing about pulling them back.
1282880	1287600	Cal Colorado runs up and grabs Julius by the shoulders and attempts to pull the whole group
1287600	1287920	back.
1287920	1289920	But, uh, he, he merely.
1289920	1290480	What?
1290480	1291840	Julius is in the front.
1291840	1298320	So that makes sense that, but he, I wasn't a little confused about the pulling backwards
1298320	1299040	part.
1299040	1299360	Okay.
1299360	1303040	So in my mind, Stevie is on the back holding back.
1303040	1305520	Julius was in the front, trying to push him forward.
1305520	1310400	And then Beck came up behind Julius and was pile driving the two of them.
1310480	1311280	Yeah, he was.
1311280	1314160	Well then no one to me grabbing Julius's shoulders.
1314160	1314960	Exactly.
1314960	1315680	It didn't help.
1315680	1316240	It didn't help.
1316240	1318720	But thankfully you got the momentum on your side.
1318720	1322320	And so I think we're all feeling pretty good about the outcome of this.
1322320	1323760	I'm grabbing Stevie's shoulders then.
1324960	1328960	Me and Julius are, we're between Chuck Bidwell and the chasm is at our back.
1328960	1330000	Yes, that is correct.
1330000	1331360	Yes, absolutely.
1331360	1335120	And it is going to continue with Julius Summers.
1335120	1336400	This is a good old fashioned tug of war.
1336400	1337440	It's a good old fashioned tug.
1337440	1339520	We got a good old fashioned tug of war.
1339520	1340800	He's only one.
1340800	1342640	Oh, like that old show Squid Game.
1342640	1343040	Away.
1345280	1346480	Still haven't seen it.
1346480	1354400	Julius is going to continue pushing back and try to give a little tickle to maybe distract.
1354400	1355360	Now we're talking.
1355360	1356320	Distract him a little bit.
1356320	1358000	Armpit, prostate, where are you talking?
1358000	1359200	A 70 on a 60.
1360160	1361680	You only put 60 in tickle?
1362240	1362480	Yeah.
1364000	1365680	Yeah, that's not going to do it.
1365680	1368800	As you go to tickle him, you feel the wettest.
1368800	1370080	Where are you getting in?
1370080	1371760	Well, it doesn't matter.
1371760	1372560	It's going to be wet.
1372560	1373760	It's going to be nasty.
1373760	1380640	I had my arms on his shoulders, like pushing back and I took one hand off to tickle him
1381200	1384160	and I put it up into his armpit.
1384160	1388160	But like the polo is like sopping wet and the tickle.
1389680	1391760	Well, it's like squeezing a ShamWow.
1391760	1392160	Right.
1392160	1395040	It's just there's too much pressure to tickle.
1395120	1397120	It just feels like I'm poking his armpit.
1397120	1397680	Gross.
1397680	1398800	Yeah, absolutely.
1400240	1400880	He's like, ouch.
1401440	1402560	Stevie attempts the same.
1405280	1406400	Will it tickle?
1406400	1407520	Everybody, tickle him.
1408640	1409760	Tickle fight.
1409760	1411040	To the same result.
1411040	1416000	Finger in armpit, wiggling around, but just poking and sopping wet you.
1416000	1419600	Beck, we need more tickles.
1419600	1421200	Oh dude, I'm really good at tickling.
1421200	1421700	Hang on.
1422560	1424000	I'm 31 good at tickling.
1424880	1429680	He's going to spend luck to make that a 42, which is a success.
1429680	1430960	How does Dougal look?
1430960	1432320	What cool thing did he do?
1434000	1440320	Chuck Bidwell continues with one foot over the edge like he you're holding on now.
1440320	1445040	You've had to move out of the way in order to not get pushed off the back yourselves
1445040	1447760	and it is all up to Cal Colorado.
1447760	1450720	Cal Colorado says, hey, look over there and I want to roll persuade.
1451440	1454000	Success.
1455120	1456960	I rolled a hundred.
1458480	1460000	Holy shit.
1460000	1460240	Right?
1460240	1461120	That's what that is?
1461120	1461840	All zeros.
1463040	1463280	Oops.
1463920	1469920	So my plan was to shout, hey, look over there and then slap lasagna in his eyes with my
1469920	1470480	other hand.
1471920	1475440	But instead I slip trying to get lasagna out of my pockets.
1475440	1477280	Where you're pointing is just down.
1478480	1479440	Hey, look down there.
1481280	1481840	Gladly.
1482400	1483920	He looks down there.
1483920	1484560	Sorry guys.
1486720	1489680	This is one of those let go or don't situations.
1489680	1492000	Raise your hand if you're audio medium.
1492000	1498800	Say a holler at if you're letting go of Chuck of Chuck as he is strongly moving over the
1498800	1499200	edge.
1499200	1501360	Basically you're choosing whether or not you're going over.
1501360	1503520	He's not making an attempt to grab at any of you.
1503520	1508640	However, you do see that he's making an attempt to grab for Stevie.
1508720	1509920	Can I try and intercept that?
1509920	1510960	Would I have a chance?
1510960	1511760	Yeah, let's do it.
1511760	1512800	This is your moment.
1512800	1517680	You're not going to stop him from going over because that ship is sailed, but you can stop
1517680	1518640	him from grabbing.
1518640	1520320	Just want to slap his hand away.
1520320	1525120	Because he is going for a very firm grasp based on the rules that I rolled.
1525120	1526000	It's an 18.
1526000	1528240	I don't know what you wanted to have that on.
1528240	1528480	Okay.
1528480	1530000	He succeeded with a 43.
1533200	1534480	Can I go for a slap too?
1534480	1538880	Uh, yeah, absolutely.
1538880	1539440	Go ahead and roll.
1540240	1542640	Actually, I want to make this one last tickle.
1543440	1544720	One last push for a tickle.
1547360	1548480	A 50 on a 60.
1549040	1552720	Oh, that is a good enough to tickle the grass leaves.
1552720	1555680	As he reaches out, you tickle like the inside of his wrist.
1555680	1561040	Well, yeah, as he's falling, the pressure of the tickle decreases enough just to get
1561040	1562560	to the perfect tickle pressure.
1565360	1571120	So with your hand inside his, it goes, it goes from poke to tickle.
1573120	1574240	The gradient of tickle.
1574240	1574740	Yeah.
1575280	1580080	It's turned all the way up to tickle and I get that one good tickle in before there's
1580960	1582800	before I'm not touching his armpit at all.
1582800	1586320	And like an involuntary laugh escapes as he lets go of Stevie.
1587840	1590240	Like this is like weird noise comes out of his throat.
1591200	1598480	And like releases Stevie as he just falls backwards and looks at you with these like
1598480	1599680	dead eyes.
1600880	1601680	Connor Ratliff.
1602400	1603120	Yeah.
1603120	1603920	Great podcast.
1604800	1605520	Have us on.
1605520	1606240	We'd cast you.
1606960	1608640	Oh, he would be a great Chuck Bidwell.
1608640	1610080	He would be a great Chuck Bidwell.
1610080	1611120	You listening Connor?
1612000	1612960	Dead eyed motherfucker.
1616640	1620000	As Chuck falls backwards in the classic fall backwards pose.
1620480	1626640	With kind of a blurry image behind him of the smooth cavernous crevasse.
1627280	1632080	And eventually he looking up the sound of body mix when he's ashes on a canyon floor.
1632080	1633520	I've seen a lot of wily coyote.
1633520	1634160	I think it's just a.
1637840	1643040	And when he lands each of you see something incomprehensible.
1643040	1644480	Your brain does cloud.
1645840	1649280	Your brain simply won't comprehend it.
1650160	1651120	Skull and crossbones.
1652960	1656080	The dust cloud with skull and crossbones.
1656080	1660240	The crossbones fills your stomachs with dread.
1660880	1662400	Your hands get clammy.
1662400	1664720	Your sight seems compromised.
1664720	1671680	And you feel an air blasting boom so loud that you wonder for a split moment.
1671680	1674000	If you'll ever hear again.
1674640	1678960	And I need you each to roll con times five.
1680240	1681680	To stay conscious.
1683760	1684320	I pass.
1685440	1686880	I critically fail.
1688080	1689040	It's a 77.
1690960	1694880	You're not going to believe this, but I also critically failed with an 88.
1695760	1698000	Jesus Christ.
1698640	1699280	I got a four.
1702320	1703200	Okay shit.
1704960	1707520	Thomas and Joe take our headphones off.
1707520	1708880	Take your pants off.
1709280	1711280	Take your pants or plans.
1711280	1712080	Strip Delta.
1718480	1718960	Boom.
1718960	1719360	Boom.
1723600	1730640	Luke, you feel this reverberation in your chest that shakes your entire skeleton inside your body
1730640	1733040	and just vibrates your entire being.
1733040	1734720	Your vision goes completely.
1734800	1738640	Wackity wackity wack.
1738640	1742960	And suddenly it's extremely dark.
1742960	1746160	It was a perfectly bright day here in this gorge.
1746160	1748960	And now it is extremely dark.
1748960	1750000	I need you to roll grip.
1751840	1759600	In this darkness, you see that the rest of the can crew, Cal Colorado, Beck Wilder, and Stevie
1759600	1764080	have all fallen to the ground, seemingly unconscious.
1764080	1766640	I pass with a 39 on a 44.
1766640	1768400	You only lose one grip.
1768400	1773840	Julius kind of like shakes it off and clears his vision a little bit and then is going
1773840	1778960	to try to rush over to his coworkers on the ground and see what's up to kind of try to
1778960	1779840	slap him away.
1779840	1780080	Okay.
1780080	1781440	You're kind of slapping at him.
1781440	1785600	You see the camera has fallen to the side of Beck Wilder.
1785600	1788240	You see, you know, Cal's an older guy.
1788240	1789920	He seems to have fallen okay.
1789920	1793520	He doesn't seem to like have broken anything in the fall.
1793520	1795680	Stevie's just completely out.
1795680	1796960	None of them are getting back up.
1796960	1801760	And you hear this rumble coming from the bottom of the chasm.
1801760	1807280	Julius reaches to his phone thinking about making a TikTok, but then sees that the camera
1807280	1812080	is on the ground and Beck is incapacitated and real footage is better than TikTok footage.
1812080	1817040	So he's going to grab the camera and he's going to point it at the sound.
1817040	1817440	Okay.
1817440	1822640	He's going to walk to walk with camera on his shoulder, you know, looking at the display,
1822640	1824640	a wall of fog ahead of you.
1824640	1831360	And the fog is rising up like a push pop being just lifted from something coming up as the
1831360	1834800	rumbling is growing louder and louder from below.
1834800	1835040	Yeah.
1835040	1839840	He's going to kind of, he's going to walk to the, to the ledge, but then kind of use
1839840	1845200	the camera so he doesn't have to, you know, completely look over it, but aim the camera,
1845200	1848160	see if he can see anything through the fog as the fog lifts.
1848160	1853520	Julia Summers through the viewfinder of this camera sees, what does that smell?
1854240	1855200	What does that smell?
1855200	1856640	I got weed from work today.
1858960	1859200	Yeah.
1859200	1859840	It's dank.
1859840	1861920	It's like, it's musty, but it's also.
1862720	1868000	He kind of like smacks his lips a little bit and it's like, he just sucking on salt.
1868000	1869280	That's exactly right.
1869280	1872320	I need you to witness this thing.
1872320	1879360	And in order to witness it, I need you to either ask me one question or three yes, no
1879360	1880320	questions.
1880320	1880640	Okay.
1880640	1883920	I already know that I get a salty taste in my mouth.
1883920	1884480	Yep.
1884480	1888960	I know that it sounds like disembodied voices that aren't really saying anything.
1888960	1889280	Yep.
1889280	1894960	And I know that as you remember that you begin hearing it and I know that it's a liquidy
1894960	1897680	human formed this thing.
1897680	1898160	Yep.
1898160	1899040	Sorry, give me a second.
1899040	1901040	I'll just, I'll do yes or no.
1901040	1902160	Make it quick.
1902160	1902560	Okay.
1902560	1903200	That's three.
1903200	1904160	Do I see it now?
1904160	1904560	Yes.
1904560	1905680	Is it coming at me?
1905680	1906240	Yes.
1906240	1910720	Does it give off any light since it's so dark in here?
1911280	1911760	Yes.
1911760	1921120	This incomprehensible humanoid wet energy structure erupts out of this chasm, lifting
1921120	1928400	the fog above its head as it rises its shoulders next, you see an enormous torso and you're
1928480	1930960	staring between the legs of this.
1933600	1934160	What?
1934160	1940640	Julius takes a knee to brace himself with the camera and aims the camera up at it.
1940640	1942160	And as you aim the camera up.
1942160	1945760	Fluid monster god turtle thing.
1945760	1951680	You hear all of these voices coming out of the hand that is reaching out toward you.
1951680	1954560	It's the size of a suburban.
1954560	1956400	It's coming to scoop you up.
1956400	1957200	Suburban.
1959040	1962960	Julius is going to take the camera off his shoulder and set it down on the ground toward
1962960	1964720	the camera is still kind of facing it.
1965520	1966800	He's going to run.
1966800	1967300	Okay.
1968880	1969280	Okay.
1969280	1971600	Roll a roll for athletics.
1978080	1979680	I succeed with a 43.
1982080	1983680	It was a 69.
1983680	1984240	No.
1984240	1985040	I promise.
1985040	1986400	Are you fucking kidding me?
1987040	1987600	Holy shit.
1987600	1988320	Where do you run?
1988320	1990080	How do you, how do you get away?
1991200	1991760	I'm going to run.
1991760	1992560	That's what you want.
1992560	1994880	I'm going to run back out into Grover's gorge.
1994880	1997200	Holy fucking shit, dude.
1997200	1998320	Holy fucking.
1999440	2000560	You turn the wheel.
2001360	2002240	Let's go doggies.
2002240	2003120	Doggies.
2003760	2004640	You dog the door.
2005200	2010080	While he's dogging the door, he looks back at his friends and he just goes, Oh, I'll
2010080	2010720	try to save you.
2010720	2010960	Okay.
2010960	2013840	I'd have you roll again, but you rolled the 69.
2013840	2016000	So you've dogged the door.
2016400	2016640	Yeah.
2016640	2019920	He just like flips it and it just spins on its own.
2019920	2020420	Yes.
2021440	2025520	And it immediately opens and you grab it on the other side.
2025520	2026560	Slam it shut.
2026560	2029120	Dog those doors from the other side.
2029120	2030880	You are now inside.
2030880	2036080	Luke just mouthed what the fuck to no one in this room right now.
2036080	2038080	Just looked at, I don't know what.
2039440	2041200	Holy fucking shit, dude.
2041200	2043280	I panicked as you would.
2044080	2044960	No game plan.
2044960	2045680	No game plan.
2046000	2050640	This is what you would call out of the frying pan and into the fire.
2052960	2053200	Yeah.
2053200	2058960	Julius like closes the door and locks it, seals it back up again, turns around and looks
2058960	2060720	at Grover's Gorge and just.
2060720	2060960	Okay.
2060960	2065600	You're still like in this big plant space and I'm going to roll the 69 over and say
2065600	2070080	that you did this all quite stealthily and are able to just kind of blend back into this
2070080	2070400	wall.
2070400	2075600	So you're looking out at honestly a pretty normal situation in Grover's Gorge from what
2075600	2076480	you've seen.
2076480	2079360	And by that, I mean when you first arrived, not later.
2079360	2085040	Julius knows that he can't go back into the main part of town and the only person he knows
2085040	2090400	here that might have any chance of giving a shit about what is going on specifically
2090400	2091920	with Stevie is Fox God.
2091920	2092720	Oh my God.
2093440	2094880	We're going to the GIZ?
2094880	2095760	Going to the GIZ.
2095760	2096240	Holy shit.
2096240	2096480	Okay.
2096480	2097440	How are you going to get there?
2097440	2103600	Basically your options are you can, I mean, cross over the track, this bouncy synthetic
2103600	2109840	colorful material, or you can kind of go around to a sidewalk situation over near the GIZs,
2109840	2114640	or you can cut all the way through the wall and then go around the backside of the GIZs.
2114640	2119760	I mean, I would, I'm thinking he's probably the stealthiest option would be to cut around
2119760	2125280	and go back, but there's not, I don't, I feel he thinks this is pretty fucking urgent.
2125280	2125600	Okay.
2125600	2126800	You might get caught.
2126800	2132320	So I'll give you a straight up stealth against the
2132320	2133680	perception of the town.
2133680	2137280	If you go straight there, if you, if you kind of cut around and use the sidewalk, if you
2137280	2140320	go around back, I'll give you a plus 40 to your stealth.
2140320	2140560	Okay.
2140560	2140720	Yeah.
2140720	2147040	He's going to cut around back and, and just be like, try to be stealthy, but he's booking
2147040	2147600	it.
2147600	2149440	Roll that stealth with a plus 40.
2150480	2153600	They, what did you get?
2153600	2155440	I got a 47 on an 80.
2155440	2158320	What do you think the town perception should be on the way in?
2158320	2158960	It was 80.
2159920	2160640	What did I roll?
2162320	2164880	Shit.
2165680	2167920	He could succeeded with 77.
2170240	2170560	Okay.
2170560	2173840	You're creeping through the brush and flowers.
2173840	2175120	No, I'm not creeping.
2175120	2175760	I'm running.
2175760	2181120	You're sprinting through this wall, sprinting, sprinting, sprinting, running, running, running.
2181120	2188480	And as you head around the corner behind these GIZs, you see there's a privacy fence in the
2188480	2189680	backyard, right?
2189760	2193280	So you keep going around the back of the privacy fence and you run down.
2193280	2196800	Now you're running kind of North South based on when you first arrived.
2196800	2197040	Right.
2197040	2199360	And you're running toward the far side away.
2199360	2204080	You're trying to remember where the GIZ was that Fox went into.
2204080	2209920	And as you're trying to remember, you trip on something in the ground and you look down
2209920	2211840	and you see a fucking Jackalope.
2212800	2213300	Nope.
2214560	2220880	No, there's like a metal cage that is halfway coming out of the ground just a little bit.
2220880	2226560	And at the head of this body length metal cage is a tombstone.
2226560	2231440	And as I fall on the ground, right in front of the tombstone, what do I read?
2231440	2232480	It says, oh.
2232480	2233360	Julius Sommers.
2233360	2239200	Julius Sommers Sommers Sommers Sommers Sommers Sommers Sommers Sommers Sommers Sommers.
2239200	2240160	Wait, fuck.
2240160	2241360	What is the name?
2241360	2242160	What's the name?
2242160	2243600	Is it too late to do something?
2243600	2244320	Yeah, of course it is.
2244320	2246080	What's the name on this tombstone?
2246640	2248240	Just give me a good last name.
2248240	2249200	Cream pie.
2249200	2249700	Nope.
2251120	2251680	Crump.
2251680	2252320	Crumpy.
2252320	2252880	Crumpy.
2252880	2253360	Thank you.
2253360	2253680	Okay.
2253680	2259520	So it's Jeremiah Crumpy, former mayor of Grover's Gorge.
2260080	2262240	And as you trip, you hear a voice call out.
2263120	2263840	Hi there.
2264480	2267520	Julius looks around to see where hi there's coming from.
2267520	2268000	Hello?
2268880	2269280	Hello?
2269280	2276320	Looking over the privacy fence, you see that there is a man standing on his back porch
2276320	2279520	in one of the GIZs that you were running past.
2279520	2286640	He's in a very like fine robe that's monochromatic with green accents.
2287840	2290000	And he holds up a cup of coffee to you.
2290720	2295200	Um, aren't you one of them fellas that was about to be on trial?
2295200	2297360	Aren't you supposed to be over there in the it bit?
2297360	2299360	Um, I'm not sure about that.
2299360	2302560	I actually just got into town from the train station.
2302560	2306960	I have a very important delivery for Fox Gotel and I've got to get to him.
2306960	2307460	Oh!
2308160	2309440	Uh, go ahead and roll.
2310080	2312640	Uh, either disguise or persuade.
2314480	2314980	Dude.
2317280	2318720	I got an ought one.
2318720	2321280	Oh my god!
2321280	2322560	I'm not gonna move it.
2322560	2323040	Okay.
2323040	2324560	But you can look if you want.
2324560	2328400	Oh!
2328400	2331200	That's really handy because look what I fucking rolled.
2331200	2332960	A 22 crit success.
2332960	2335840	Yes, but an ought one is the best crit success.
2335840	2338640	It's 669 but you already rolled.
2338640	2339840	Holy fuck.
2339840	2342560	Okay, so with an ought one, he's like,
2342560	2343120	No way!
2343920	2346960	Yeah, uh, I just was pointed in this direction.
2346960	2348400	Could you show me where he is?
2348960	2350320	Where his GIZ is?
2350320	2351280	Oh yeah, for sure.
2351280	2352640	He's actually next door.
2352640	2353200	Fantastic.
2353600	2357040	I was in such a hurry I seemed to trip over this mayor.
2357040	2358960	Oh yeah, Jeremiah Ripp!
2361760	2362480	Yes.
2362480	2363040	Yes, sir.
2364080	2364580	Crampy.
2365360	2367920	Here's a good one, but not long for this world, you know?
2367920	2369600	Do you mind if I hop your fence?
2369600	2371600	Oh no, I mean, look at the gate.
2371600	2373600	Julius looks at the gate and he's like,
2373600	2374560	Oh yeah, yeah, sorry.
2375360	2377600	You know, in a rush, not thinking straight.
2377600	2379200	It's okay, have a good one.
2379200	2382400	And he heads back into his GIZ.
2382400	2382880	Well done.
2383200	2387360	Holy fuck, uh, Julius fucking uses that gate.
2387360	2392240	All right, you head into the backyard of Fox Gottles GIZ.
2392240	2399040	It is absolute mayhem of cool, like, dumb toys and shit.
2399040	2403280	He's got like a basketball hoop with a trampoline next to it.
2403280	2404240	He's got a pool.
2404240	2405440	He's got a hot tub.
2405440	2409440	He's got one of those, like, you sit in it and it looks like a monster truck and you
2409440	2411040	drive it and it flips all around.
2411680	2413040	You know, he's got one of those.
2413440	2414080	Two of those.
2415520	2416240	That's crazy.
2416240	2417440	I can't believe he has three of those.
2417440	2419680	And there's an actual monster truck there too.
2421440	2426320	Damn, Julius almost trips over a hoverboard, but doesn't.
2427280	2429120	Can you describe the GIZ?
2429120	2434720	Oh yeah, from the back, it's got a nice upper deck and then a nice lower porch underneath
2434720	2435440	that's covered.
2436080	2443200	And there is like a huge bar with a built-in grill and a tabletop kind of situation.
2443200	2445440	Lots of windows in this bad boy?
2445440	2448880	Fair amount of windows, you know, want to get that natural light in there.
2448880	2451280	Can I see any movement or anybody in the house?
2451280	2453120	Yeah, Fox is dancing.
2453120	2454160	What music do I hear?
2454160	2459600	In one of the rooms, it's like, you just hear a boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
2459600	2462320	boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
2462320	2465200	Just kind of on repeat and he's just kind of getting it.
2465200	2467200	Under his breath, Julius mutters,
2467200	2468240	Everybody.
2470560	2475760	And Julius is going to take his shot and go, he's going to close his door.
2476880	2478720	Just no knock or anything.
2478720	2480080	I'm going straight in.
2480080	2482560	No fucking way, dude.
2482560	2483360	Oh shit.
2483360	2484960	Hey, what's up, my guy?
2484960	2486880	You came in through the back?
2486880	2488960	That is really something else.
2488960	2491440	I, uh, wait, did he talk more like this?
2491440	2491920	I think.
2491920	2492640	I think so.
2492640	2493680	Oh wow.
2493680	2494400	No way.
2494400	2495920	Oh my goodness.
2495920	2498320	It is fairly wonderful to see you.
2498320	2498960	Good, sir.
2498960	2500400	Where are your compatriots?
2500400	2501920	And you came in through the back.
2501920	2502720	Wowzers.
2502720	2507280	Julius goes to give him like the clap, clap, bro hug.
2507280	2509760	Yeah, clap, bro.
2509760	2510720	Yes, of course.
2510720	2512240	We are friends now.
2512240	2514720	Fox, we need your help.
2514720	2515680	Whoa, whoa.
2515680	2517280	Slow down there, buddy.
2517280	2518480	What's going on?
2518480	2520880	Do you know about the mayor?
2520880	2522000	Lovely turtle.
2522000	2522240	Yes.
2522240	2522960	Best turtle.
2522960	2523520	Best mayor.
2523680	2529040	Are you aware of the whole mayor lore?
2529040	2530160	The mayor lore.
2530720	2531200	The God.
2531920	2533680	Told, do you want to finish that, sir?
2534720	2535840	It's my last name.
2535840	2537360	Were you halfway through it?
2537360	2540000	Julius thinks this makes this a whole lot harder.
2542880	2547840	Is there an army in Grover's Gorge?
2547840	2548880	No, no, no.
2548880	2551040	We have no need for an army.
2551040	2552720	We have the landlord.
2552720	2557120	Mr. Vernon Covington takes care of all of our aggressive needs.
2558400	2562400	Julius is doing what I'm doing, and he's just kind of like licking his lips and kind of
2563120	2565600	just, what the fuck am I going to do?
2567520	2571680	I had plans for if you failed a bunch of things, but the succeeding is...
2572320	2573120	It's unusual.
2573120	2573840	It's nuts.
2574960	2577200	Fox, I'm going to be straight with you.
2577200	2577760	Please.
2577760	2578880	We don't have a lot of time.
2579680	2581360	My coworkers...
2581360	2581860	Sure.
2582320	2583840	The can people.
2583840	2584480	And Stevie.
2585040	2585360	Yes?
2585920	2586240	Faith.
2586880	2591680	He kind of turns his head to the side like a dog when you say squirrel.
2591680	2593520	I said faith, not squirrel.
2593520	2594000	Squirrel?
2595440	2596080	Your faith.
2596640	2599680	Yes, my dearly departed sister Faith.
2600960	2602320	She's actually alive.
2603040	2608000	Stevie is Faith, but she might be dearly departed soon if you don't help.
2608640	2610160	Whoa, okay, okay, okay.
2611440	2618800	I've still got a grip on what's going on here, so I'd say that I will help.
2618800	2625120	I don't believe you that my sister is Stevie that didn't even look like her.
2625120	2628720	If something were to happen to Sandro, who would be the mayor?
2628720	2629600	Chuck Bidwell.
2629600	2632560	If something happened to Chuck, who would be the mayor?
2632560	2639680	Well, he kind of scratches his chin, looks around at all of his things.
2640640	2641840	Do you want to play VR?
2642720	2643680	Maybe later.
2644480	2648640	Gee, who, who, who?
2648640	2649600	Oh, right, yes.
2649600	2654400	You were asking about who would be mayor if it weren't Chuck Bidwell.
2654400	2660640	Well, there's got to be a line in case, you know, something, a line of succession in case
2660640	2662240	something awful happened.
2662240	2663600	No, I don't think there is.
2664240	2665280	Would you want to be the mayor?
2665520	2669920	I suppose I could be the mayor.
2669920	2670800	Fantastic.
2670800	2672320	I, I would vote for you.
2672320	2674080	Let's hold an election right now.
2674080	2674880	Hmm.
2674880	2676480	Well, this is a wild thought.
2676480	2678480	I wasn't expecting to become mayor today.
2678480	2680720	Well, why wouldn't Chuck just be mayor?
2680720	2682480	This is purely hypothetical.
2682480	2683440	Hypothetical.
2683440	2685280	I mean, I didn't even run in the election.
2686000	2687920	Did anyone else besides Chuck?
2687920	2689440	No, of course not.
2689440	2692800	Well, I mean, you, you've got a really cool house.
2692800	2693920	I think you should be mayor.
2694800	2695520	Wow.
2695520	2698000	Flattery works on this guy.
2698000	2699520	Let's do this, buddy.
2699520	2700080	Cool.
2700080	2705440	Come with me to certify you in case you had to be the third in line for mayor.
2705440	2706240	Okay.
2706240	2707680	Let's go do that.
2707680	2708800	How do we do that?
2708800	2710800	By talking to your sister.
2710800	2711360	Okay.
2711360	2712000	Hmm.
2712000	2712960	She's in the train station.
2712960	2716320	She just had come back and she was about to see us off.
2716320	2717120	Okay.
2717120	2718240	Let's go now though.
2718800	2720160	And let's take these hoverboards.
2720960	2722560	I like the hoverboards.
2722720	2724480	I like the hoverboard idea.
2724480	2726480	I do want to play VR.
2726480	2729920	I'm sure that you have a high-tech VR.
2730800	2732000	What about AR?
2732000	2735760	Strap it on augmented reality and you can play as we go.
2735760	2736080	Okay.
2736080	2738480	Roll persuade with a plus 40.
2738480	2739680	Cause that was brilliant.
2743440	2747360	I got a 97 on a 100.
2747360	2750720	Oh shit.
2751520	2752640	That's incredible.
2752640	2753360	He failed.
2754320	2754800	Let's go.
2756080	2762080	Julius and Fox both strap on like Oculus has like futuristic.
2762640	2765120	Got all got chilis headsets.
2766560	2767920	Turn on the AR function.
2767920	2774160	And it's like looking through your own eyes, but he has programmed it for us to like, we're
2774160	2776400	like Pac-Man and we're running.
2776400	2777680	No, we're like Sonic.
2777680	2781760	And we're collecting rings as we run towards the train station.
2782720	2784320	Have you played this one before?
2784320	2785840	It's got a crazy monster.
2785840	2787600	Once you collect enough rings.
2787600	2788720	Well, yes, of course.
2788720	2796800	I always try to get the septum Gordman, the septum Gordman's head to cut them off.
2796800	2797600	Fantastic.
2797600	2798400	Get the rings.
2799120	2799600	Let's go.
2800160	2800880	Oh my God.
2800880	2801120	Okay.
2801120	2803280	So you're running out the front door.
2803280	2806320	I figured we would just take the same path I took here.
2806320	2807040	Oh, why?
2807040	2808640	Why would we go out the back?
2808640	2809280	More rings.
2810240	2812080	More rings.
2812640	2814880	You brilliant son of a bitch.
2814880	2823120	And you guys dip out ring collectors on your way through his backyard around the back area
2823120	2826800	over the corpse with the metal cage around it.
2826800	2828800	The corpse, the bear.
2828800	2829440	It's a corpse.
2829440	2833760	The corpse, the burial site, the bone skeleton, the plot.
2833760	2834260	Yeah.
2834820	2843140	With the metal cage around it, head back around the sides and toward that doggy doggy door
2843860	2845380	and out out here.
2845380	2847140	Well, we've got to go in.
2847140	2848180	We've got to go in.
2848820	2855300	And Julius gives the door a little spin and opens it up.
2858020	2858420	Okay.
2858420	2858820	Perfect.
2858820	2860980	The boys will come back for the rest.
2860980	2862340	Fuck yeah, dude.
2864260	2872980	In the back.
2873860	2879540	Or maybe just like through the skull directly through the brain, get stabbed in the head,
2879540	2881700	but not hard enough to go through.
2881700	2882500	Break your bones.
2883380	2886100	Well, we've got Thomas and Joe back in the room now.
2886100	2886740	So what happened?
2886740	2888980	I need everyone to roll an alertness check for me.
2888980	2889480	Oh shit.
2890260	2890900	Me too.
2890900	2891400	Yep.
2894260	2897380	Fail.
2897380	2899380	I pass a seven on a 40.
2899380	2900580	53 on a 70.
2901140	2903220	Thomas, take off your headphones for me real quick.
2905620	2907300	Beck Wilder, Julius Summers.
2909460	2910660	Let's start with Beck Wilder.
2911700	2918020	You come to your stomach still just queasy, your hands wet and cold.
2918020	2925140	You're feeling completely disoriented, but you hear this rumble and this noise and this
2926340	2931700	strange kind of like maybe, oh, what do you, what is that?
2931700	2934180	And Luke, I need you to take off your headphones too.
2936180	2943060	You can either ask me one question or three yes, no questions about what it is that you
2943060	2948980	see down at the bottom of this enormous chasm as you come to and look over the edge.
2948980	2952340	Can I ask the one question, what do I see at the bottom of this ledge?
2955220	2955720	Certainly.
2956500	2957460	I want to ask that.
2957460	2958100	Okay.
2958100	2961940	What do you know about this, this thing, this kind of energy that you saw?
2961940	2966820	I saw that it was super circus, like it was wet and it made Chuck physically wet.
2966820	2970980	It does the same thing this time where it just kind of like, you see this
2973460	2982100	like strangely moving wet energy there at the bottom of the chasm and it shoots like a spray,
2982100	2989220	like a jet stream through the windows of the church, the upside down church,
2989220	2995060	the upside down church that is at the bottom of this chasm off to your right side.
2995060	2998020	And I need you to roll grip.
3003700	3005940	Uh, I fail.
3005940	3006340	Okay.
3006340	3014100	You're going to roll a D6 and add one for seeing this extremely unnatural sight
3014100	3020100	as your brain tries to figure out and kind of make it something that you recognize.
3021860	3023380	I rolled a five.
3023380	3024580	Five plus one is six.
3025940	3029540	So start putting those in order as you lose six grip,
3030500	3035060	fight, flight, freeze, and take off your headphones, please.
3037300	3038340	Luke is back.
3038340	3040420	I'm back, back again.
3040420	3046580	As you walk in, you see something moving at the bottom of the chasm.
3046580	3049140	You smell that salty sea spray.
3050500	3053220	You hear those voices calling out.
3053860	3058980	And at this point you can once again ask one question or three yes, no questions.
3059540	3059860	Okay.
3059860	3061300	How fast has it gone?
3061300	3063460	Well, it was enormous before, right?
3063460	3063700	Right.
3063700	3064900	It was extremely enormous.
3064900	3071060	Now it's like still kind of similar looking, but it's down at the bottom and it's making its way.
3071060	3076580	It's still enormous, bigger than a human making its way through the valley toward the church
3077140	3082980	off to the right side, the upside down church stuck in this unnaturally smooth chasm.
3083780	3087620	So how, I guess that was how fast is it moving?
3087620	3093380	This enormous humanoid was sprinting at almost 143 miles per hour.
3093380	3102580	And then it dives through the glass and into pouring itself into this upside down church.
3102580	3103080	Roll grip.
3106580	3107300	Fail.
3107300	3109140	Roll a D six and add one, please.
3109860	3111620	It's incomprehensible.
3111620	3113540	Your mind cannot handle what you see.
3113540	3114740	Two plus one is three.
3115300	3120980	As you lose three grip, your hold on reality loosens just so.
3120980	3122580	That puts me at a 40.
3122580	3123080	Jesus.
3123620	3124180	That's low.
3124180	3126100	With a breaking point at 36.
3126740	3128100	Oh boy, let's bring them all back.
3128820	3134500	Beck Wilder, I need you to place an order, fight, flight, and freeze.
3134500	3139220	It's a freeze number one, flight number two, and fight.
3139780	3140340	Fight is it?
3140340	3141940	Yeah, fight is number three.
3141940	3143060	All right, roll that D six.
3143460	3145140	It's a six.
3145140	3145700	Okay.
3145700	3147940	And what was your top freeze?
3147940	3148740	Freeze.
3148740	3151780	Cal stands up from tying his shoe and says, what's going on, fellas?
3151780	3153940	You feel clammy hands.
3153940	3156580	You feel your stomach is still completely unsettled.
3156580	3161700	Your vision is kind of off your head, shaking, vibrating almost still.
3161700	3170020	And you see Beck Wilder staring directly, completely frozen down toward the church.
3170100	3176340	And when you look in that direction, you see where you had previously seen like this beautiful
3176340	3179220	stained glass in the front of this church.
3179220	3185620	Now you see it has been completely broken and there's a hole in the stained glass that
3185620	3187220	leads into this church.
3187220	3188660	Who would do that to a church?
3189300	3189800	Teens.
3190980	3197940	You see that Fox Godel is here with Julius Summers and Stevie is coming too.
3200340	3202820	It's good to see you again, Fox Godel, obviously.
3203380	3207460	Also Fox and Julius are both wearing VR headsets.
3207460	3208020	Oh yeah.
3214020	3216100	We're collecting rings.
3216100	3217780	How many do you have so far, Julius?
3218820	3219540	He's rolling.
3221940	3224660	I only managed to pick up 11.
3224660	3226660	Oh, I have 79.
3226660	3229140	That is considerably more than you, sir.
3229140	3229860	Yes.
3229860	3233140	Julius was telling me that we're going to make me mayor.
3233140	3233860	I'm sorry.
3233860	3234100	What?
3235060	3236500	When was this discussed?
3236500	3238260	How long was I tying my shoe?
3238260	3240420	Trust me, Fox is the mayor now.
3240420	3244100	He's the emergency mandated mayor of Grover's Gorge.
3244100	3244980	Stevie, Stevie.
3244980	3245540	Hold on.
3245540	3246040	What?
3246580	3247460	What's going on here?
3247460	3247860	I don't know.
3247860	3251220	I feel fucking bad and weird.
3251220	3252660	What happened?
3252660	3253380	That noise.
3254020	3254980	What was that?
3255540	3256260	It was God.
3256260	3256760	God.
3258340	3261460	Beck, did you see God while I was gone?
3261460	3265220	Beck is just staring down into the church still, but he nods.
3265780	3266500	Beck, what?
3267300	3268100	Again?
3268100	3269620	Beck, did you get it on camera?
3269620	3271300	I got it on camera.
3271300	3272740	I feel around for my camera.
3273540	3276580	Well, your camera was placed back down next to you.
3276580	3281700	And as we have determined in this game, when Beck is conscious, he is filming.
3281700	3283860	So yes, you shot what you saw.
3283860	3284420	Dope.
3284420	3284820	Yeah.
3284820	3285320	Yeah.
3285720	3286220	Yeah.
3286840	3287160	Dudes.
3287160	3287800	Yeah, I got it.
3287800	3288840	I think I got it, dudes.
3289400	3290200	Show me.
3290200	3291000	Show me God.
3291000	3292040	Are we safe?
3292040	3292680	Should we go?
3293720	3294120	What?
3294120	3294600	Fox?
3294600	3296680	I mean, we're going to make you the mayor.
3296680	3297800	How would that help?
3297800	3299880	Stevie, you said that the mayor...
3299880	3301720	He's already released.
3301720	3304520	We'd have to do the whole thing to get him back in.
3304520	3305080	I don't know.
3305080	3305800	What's the whole thing?
3305800	3307240	I don't know, but it was a...
3307240	3309160	I don't know any of it.
3309160	3309960	I don't know.
3310760	3312120	Well, does Fox know?
3312120	3313560	Know what, my good man?
3313560	3314200	He doesn't.
3314840	3315880	Where'd you come from, dude?
3315880	3317480	Yeah, we're...
3317480	3323240	Oh, I was just hanging out, giving my old record player the spins and just giving my
3323240	3328360	hips a good loosening when old Julius popped in and suggested we do some AR while making
3328360	3329960	me the new mayor for some reason.
3329960	3334440	Or not even the new mayor, but just another backup, was it, behind Chuck Bidwell?
3335640	3336840	What do you mean Julius showed up?
3336840	3339160	He's been standing here by us this whole time.
3339160	3340760	Yeah, I look at Cal.
3341320	3343000	How long were we out, dude?
3343240	3344840	Can both of you roll grip, please?
3346600	3347800	Ooh, I pass.
3348920	3353480	I'm getting older and sometimes I lose bits of time.
3354280	3356680	I fail hard, a 97.
3356680	3360520	Okay, so you're going to lose zero grip, Cal.
3360520	3364040	However, Beck Wilder, you're going to roll a D4.
3365400	3366120	It's a one.
3366120	3367320	Okay, you only lose one grip.
3368600	3370360	That brings me down to 51.
3370360	3373160	Stevie, I panicked.
3373160	3379160	I just thought that the thing had to be in the mayor and if we made someone the mayor,
3379720	3381160	it would have to go back in.
3381720	3385480	Okay, that seems right.
3385480	3386520	Yeah, okay.
3387080	3388920	How do we make him the mayor?
3388920	3390360	That doesn't seem right to me.
3392760	3394280	Well, this is Godel Gorge.
3394280	3400120	I feel like you guys have, you know, can call Godel Law and make an emergency mandate.
3400360	3400920	On God.
3402200	3402920	On God.
3402920	3403400	On God.
3403400	3403960	On God.
3403960	3404600	On God, dude.
3405560	3405880	Okay.
3406440	3408840	I'm not as confident as you, Julius.
3408840	3411880	I'm not, but it's the only thing I could think of.
3411880	3417640	I hereby, as the oldest Godel in Grover's Gorge.
3417640	3419640	And Julius is like pointing at Fox.
3419640	3425560	Declare Fox Godel as the mayor of Grover's Gorge.
3425560	3426680	Why not you, Stevie?
3426680	3428920	And as she finishes saying that.
3429880	3431480	Stevie's older than Fox?
3432360	3433240	Now she is.
3433240	3434680	I don't think I caught that earlier.
3434680	3436840	I was picturing her being the younger sister.
3436840	3438360	I think I caught that.
3441000	3443000	Luke and Joe, take off your headphones real quick.
3448040	3448440	Thomas.
3450040	3455400	A wildly frenetic, wet energy.
3456680	3466840	Comes flying out of the church, out of the giant canyon and into Fox Godel, throwing
3466840	3470920	him backwards, back towards the plant wall.
3472360	3479080	You can either ask me one question or three yes, no questions about what you see, what
3479080	3485400	you smell, what you hear, what you feel as this thing kind of zips past you and you're
3485400	3489400	trying to perceive it, but it's really hard.
3489400	3491320	Almost like it's incomprehensible.
3492200	3493480	Has everybody else done this?
3494360	3494860	Yep.
3496280	3497960	Did they ask good questions?
3497960	3498460	Nope.
3500120	3500680	Pressure's off.
3502520	3503400	No, they did.
3503400	3504440	What's its name?
3504440	3505320	What's its name?
3507720	3514600	Is that something that you could tell from its appearance or sound or feel or taste?
3514600	3516840	You said I could ask you one question or three.
3516840	3518600	About how you perceive it.
3518600	3519160	Okay.
3519160	3520120	It's a good question.
3520120	3520840	What's your name?
3525320	3529080	Three yes, no questions or one question.
3530040	3532760	Would you tell me if I asked a question that's already been asked?
3532760	3533000	Okay.
3533000	3533960	What's it smell like?
3534600	3535160	Wait, no.
3535160	3535960	How do I kill it?
3536920	3538840	That's also not something you can perceive.
3539800	3540360	Why not?
3540600	3545080	How do I kill?
3545080	3546120	I want to kill God.
3548200	3550760	Zach, what's a smart question to ask?
3551720	3552600	I don't know, man.
3553160	3555240	Well, then why'd you think of this game?
3555240	3556120	I don't know.
3556120	3558120	Hey, they came up with questions.
3560120	3560620	Well.
3565160	3566600	And that's the end of the episode.
3567960	3568460	What?
3571160	3573160	Okay, I'm sure they asked what it looked like.
3573720	3574220	Did they?
3575400	3577800	I've got intense decision paralysis here.
3577800	3579560	I can't think of anything.
3579560	3580680	Just go through the senses.
3580680	3581160	I don't know.
3581160	3583400	Well, they asked, look, what does it look like?
3583400	3585240	I'm not going to tell you what they asked.
3585240	3586120	I thought you said you would.
3586120	3589000	If it had already been asked, you'd tell me to ask something.
3589000	3589320	Okay.
3589320	3591240	Luke asked me what it looks like, but okay.
3593000	3596200	All I heard was I'm not going to tell you what they asked.
3600360	3607800	Boys.
3607800	3611640	If you can hear me sign to me, I know one of them.
3613880	3614380	Okay.
3617160	3618440	How big is it?
3618440	3619000	Great question.
3619560	3620060	It is.
3620920	3622440	Wait, is it bigger than a bread box?
3623000	3623500	Yes.
3624120	3624920	How big is it?
3625480	3626600	Oh my God.
3629640	3632920	I can't think of three better questions or like two more questions.
3632920	3634200	Just fucking tell me how big it is.
3635320	3641480	It is like the amount of wet of an Olympic sized pool.
3641480	3643160	Thousands of gallons of water?
3643160	3643660	Yes.
3643880	3646200	Oh, much bigger than a bread box.
3646200	3654200	Just pouring into and through Fox Gottel, lifting him off his feet.
3654200	3658520	Higher and higher and throwing him over toward the plant wall.
3658520	3659560	I need you to roll grip.
3661480	3662680	Uh, pass again.
3662680	3663480	19.
3663480	3663880	Okay.
3663880	3665000	You just lose one grip.
3665000	3666280	Oh, well that breaks me.
3668760	3669260	All right.
3669880	3670440	Sorry about that.
3670440	3671240	That was long.
3671240	3672040	That was a workout.
3672040	3673560	That was a long time rolling my ears.
3675480	3676280	What'd you guys ask?
3684200	3690600	Cause my life is great, and it's all mine.
3698440	3705080	Cause my life is great, and it's all mine.
