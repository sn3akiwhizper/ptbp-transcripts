0	3280	Howdy, my friends and foes.
3280	6880	It's the titan of Tennessee, Wolf the dog.
6880	11420	And I am coming at you live from Groversville?
11420	14060	Now how the fuck did I end up here?
14060	15440	Wolf, dammit.
15440	18200	I guess I'll still do my best to give y'all
18200	23200	a wonderful show here at 694.2 PTBP.
23940	26460	This barn smells like shit,
26460	29080	but not that good kind of stank.
29080	31440	That bad stank.
31440	35240	Something weird is going on around here.
35240	37840	Anyway, this week's Howlin' with Wolf
37840	41240	is from at necro wang on Twitter,
41240	45320	who tweeted about the show and tagged at pretending pod,
45320	47740	which is a rad thing to do regardless
47740	51280	of if you have a necro wang, a bio wang,
51280	55680	or any sort of wang in between, they write.
55680	57660	Hello, Wolf the dog.
57660	59300	How are you today?
59300	63260	It's a true honor for you to read my words on your show.
63260	65700	May I take this moment to speak with you,
65700	69300	oh magnificent beast of the festering heap
69300	73620	about the king in yellow and his most radiant church.
73620	75960	Our king has feelings, Wolf.
75960	80180	He's happy when we're happy and sad when we're suffering.
80180	84060	He wants us to talk to him through prayer and through plays.
84060	87500	And he wants to talk back and stand before us.
88340	92340	So, my sewer surfing and delightfully grimy friend,
92340	95100	may I invite you to our king's gala,
95100	99260	yours truly, servant of our king in yellow,
99260	104260	Layered Christopher at necro wang on Twitter.
104300	108380	Well, Lord Christopher, servant of the king in yellow,
108380	111380	I'm sorry to say that my heart and soul
111380	113660	already belong to another.
113660	116480	They provide warmth when I am clammy.
116480	119960	They provide the densest of creams.
119960	123560	They devour those who would speak ill of them.
123560	126600	And they got a real cool radio show.
126600	129280	It's me, I'm my own god.
129280	131000	Suck it, king in yellow.
131000	133860	It's wolf in Greece for me, baby.
133860	135600	And hey, guess what?
135600	137240	If you want to write up something
137240	141920	for your Tennessean wolf to how, it's real simple.
141920	146160	Just tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram.
146680	148200	It's as easy as that.
148200	153120	Or you can write up a five star review on Apple podcast
153120	158120	and send a screenshot to pretendingpod at gmail.com.
158440	160280	Easy, pleasey.
160280	164880	Or you can tag us on Facebook, I guess, if you have to.
164880	167460	And if you got sloppy wet mitts like me
167460	171300	and you hate trying to type handles on the internet,
171300	174160	release those worries, babies.
174160	177660	I put links to every single succulent smidgen
177660	182000	of our saucy socials in the super secret show notes.
182000	184280	Bet you can't find them.
184280	186720	Bet you can't click on them.
186720	191720	Ahem, Merriam-Webster defines a segue as
191720	195940	a transition made without pause or interruption.
195940	199680	And don't mind if I do because it's time for the news.
199680	203840	Last week here at 694.2 PTBP,
203840	208060	we released our second of two season one wrap up episodes
208060	211240	wherein we finished answering every single question
211240	215840	sent in by you, our lewd and lovely listeners.
215840	217860	But this week is going to be the start
217860	220960	of something new and horrible.
220960	225960	I am pleased to announce the coming of a guest handler.
226000	230520	After all, guests should be taken care of,
230520	234800	especially when they are named David Winters.
234800	238240	And Wolf does not simply introduce a new friend
238240	243240	without also introducing a brand spanking new tune.
243300	248300	So swallow your spit and prepare you for something scary.
248520	252580	This one is Brat Pit with Miss Merri.
252580	256580	["I Gotta Work In The Morning"]
282580	287580	What's up everybody, it's Zach.
300140	303340	I am here with Pretending To Be People.
303340	305820	We are starting a new one shot.
305820	310200	We are playing a scenario of a little game
310200	315200	called Delta Green and we are here with a guest handler.
315360	317560	That's right, we are here with a guest handler.
317560	322560	He is the rules lawyer on the Glass Cannon Network's
322560	325760	Androids and Aliens, a Starfinder podcast.
325760	330760	He is the dungeon master of New Game Who Dis,
331120	334940	Dungeon Crawl Classics on the Glass Cannon Network.
334940	339940	He is David Winters.
340240	341080	Hello, David.
341080	344200	Hello, hello, thank you for having me.
344200	345180	Thanks for coming on, man.
345180	346760	We're really looking forward to having you here.
346760	349060	We are really excited because for the first time
349060	351720	in our podcast history, we will be playing Delta Green.
351720	352560	Yeah.
352560	356960	Oh, funny how that happens, finally.
356960	359040	We're gonna see if we like it.
359040	360600	Yeah, we thought we'd try it out.
360600	365120	So it's up to you to convince us to enjoy this game.
366240	368480	That's not too much on your shoulders there, is it David?
368480	370960	No, not at all, but like I said pre-show,
370960	373140	I don't plan on there being much rules lawyering
373140	375080	from my direction at least
375080	377100	because I don't know the rules either.
377100	378220	So we're all just gonna.
378220	379540	Perfect.
379540	381160	Well, I think we're just gonna make this up as we go.
381160	383960	To at least one or two episodes of our show before this.
383960	386480	So you know what you're walking into.
386480	388280	More than one or two episodes.
388280	390520	I've made it kind of past the point of no return
390520	391360	on your show.
391360	395680	And in fact, your show is actually the only actual play show
395680	398140	outside of the GCN shows that I listened to.
398700	400300	Hell yeah, dude.
400300	402540	Yeah, this was a great connection.
402540	403920	And so when you pinged me and you're like,
403920	405020	hey, we should do this.
405020	405980	I was like, hell yeah.
405980	408080	Cause for the most part, when people ping me,
408080	409380	I say, hell no.
410420	413220	Very, very happy to be here.
413220	414040	We're glad you're here.
414040	415300	Yeah, this is exciting.
415300	416780	For those of you who are listening,
416780	418460	who don't know who we are,
418460	421500	if you came for David Winters,
422500	423700	we're just gonna let that one slide.
423700	426580	Okay, and then you don't know who we are.
426580	427940	And I'm Zach.
428700	432100	I am the normal handler of pretending to be people.
432100	436420	And I am here with three of my best friends
436420	438020	in the whole world,
438020	441940	who I get to spend time with role-playing, yay.
441940	442860	I'm Joe.
442860	443700	There it is.
443700	445040	Yeah, I'm Luke.
445040	446720	I'm like the serious one.
446720	447780	Yup.
447780	450040	The rules kind of pushing everybody through.
450040	450880	Yeah.
450880	451700	Good things.
451700	452540	Get that plot moving.
452540	453380	Flowing, you know.
453380	454220	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
454220	455040	I'm Thomas, I'm the dumb one.
455280	459160	We've all found our niche.
459160	462120	David, do you wanna tell us what scenario we're playing?
462120	462960	No.
462960	463780	Okay, sounds good.
463780	466280	And so we're playing a Delta Green scenario
468360	471400	that you'll find out what it is later.
473480	474920	No, I'll tell you, I'll tell you.
474920	478380	But you guys can't go researching this in between shows.
478380	479220	Research?
479220	481080	So that's, yeah, well, sorry.
481080	483560	That's really only a risk for like,
483560	485640	yeah, one of us, maybe.
487560	488400	Reading?
488400	489220	That's fair.
489220	490480	That's a very, very fair point.
490480	493400	I guess maybe I'm giving a little bit too much credit.
493400	496800	But Zach and I actually went through several iterations
496800	499240	of possible scenarios until we finally found one
499240	502680	that he was not familiar with in at least some capacity.
502680	505840	And at least according to him, the rest of you all,
505840	507680	you know, you said you can just run whatever.
507680	508920	They don't really research.
508920	512140	If Zach doesn't know it, there is no way that I know it.
512140	513080	Exactly.
513440	516360	He was very demeaning when it came to
516360	518160	describing your level of familiarity
518160	519200	with Delta Green scenarios.
519200	520560	But that's neither here nor there.
520560	522680	Speaking truth with love.
522680	527560	Well, I mean, you dove so into Delta Green
527560	530280	when we first started, you read all these scenarios
530280	532300	and you're like, I'm not gonna run any of them.
532300	535060	I'm immediately gonna start writing my own cool shit.
535060	538000	And so you ran us through that at home for a couple of years
538000	539720	and then we started recording that.
539720	543400	But yeah, basically we never wanted to spoil the surprise.
543400	544280	Which was rad.
544280	546880	We're all in it for the surprise, yeah.
546880	548200	Yeah, totally.
548200	551620	And you wrote a great 40 episode story.
554000	558160	I did, I wrote a great 40 episode story for season one.
558160	559240	113 episodes.
560820	563600	And so if you haven't checked this out, you can go back.
563600	568600	We have 113 episode long season one
568660	570760	that tells one continuous story
570760	573160	of a small town called Contention.
573160	577360	And then we also have one other short little game,
577360	579280	a little bonus in which we play
579280	582120	Call of Cthulhu's Bleak Prospect.
582120	585280	And we actually had the author run that game for us.
585280	588680	So Scott Dorward, the guy who wrote Bleak Prospect
588680	590700	came on and ran us through Bleak Prospect,
590700	592240	which was an excellent time,
592240	594280	which also tied into Glass Cannon
594280	598120	cause they ended up running Bleak Prospect as well
598520	599360	on new game Houdis.
599360	601240	So it was really fun hearing another group
601240	604960	play through a scenario in a completely different way.
604960	607360	They played it way different than we played it.
608960	611420	Oh, did Scott run you through that one?
611420	614520	Oh, no, they had their DM, their GM, Troy.
614520	615360	I'm totally kidding.
615360	616440	Oh.
616440	617360	I'm being caddies.
617360	618360	Oh, oh, oh.
624120	627420	Well, speaking of Call of Cthulhu though,
627580	629220	getting back to your original question,
629220	630460	what we're gonna be running through
630460	632900	is actually from the original source book
632900	635060	that came out in the mid nineties
635060	637460	before Delta Green was even a system.
637460	638620	You know, the original source book
638620	641260	to basically modernize Call of Cthulhu.
641260	643780	And this came out in the mid nineties, I think.
643780	646020	So this scenario actually takes place even before that.
646020	648060	We're in like the early nineties
648060	650060	and the scenario is called Convergence
650060	653260	and it takes place in a little town in Tennessee.
653260	655060	But the great thing about this though.
655060	656660	Shit, we actually all read that one.
656740	658060	Yeah, we're very familiar with this.
658060	660180	Oh, fuck dude.
660180	661580	Oh, shit.
662500	663340	Oops.
663340	664160	Convergence, contention.
664160	666340	It's basically a one-to-one rip off.
666340	669740	I'm a tenofile, so anything related to the state.
670740	672540	This is part of being professionals though,
672540	676720	is really just walling that off and playing it fresh.
676720	679540	And I know you're capable of it,
679540	681260	but no, I was gonna say,
681260	684060	Shane Ivey actually was really generous in this case
684060	685940	because they just ran their Kickstarter
685940	689120	for the next dozen Delta Green books that are coming out.
689120	691740	This is being reprinted in one of those early books.
691740	693180	This is one of the lowest stretch goals.
693180	695140	It was like their $70,000 stretch goal.
695140	697320	And he was nice enough to send over the draft
697320	699860	of the new version of it this week.
699860	700700	Cool.
700700	701520	Very cool.
701520	702540	You hear that listeners?
702540	704820	Yeah, that's what we're rolling with today.
704820	705660	I dig it.
705660	706480	Shall we?
706480	707320	Let's do it.
707320	708220	I think we shall.
708220	709720	Yeah, we actually have to play a game.
709720	712940	It's just not an hour of banter per episode.
712940	715060	I think that we're all much more comfortable
715060	716860	once we start playing the game.
716860	717700	Yeah.
717700	722700	It works the opposite of a lot of GCN shows
722700	724180	where we don't want to play the game,
724180	726700	do everything we can to actively avoid it.
726700	729020	We're really stressed out just talking to each other
729020	731060	and we're like, can I please be someone else?
731060	732980	Yeah, I want to hide in my character for a while.
732980	735620	Thanks to Christian to be a person.
735620	737120	That's the name of the show.
737120	737960	Nailed it.
737960	739400	I guess let me set the scene then.
739400	740240	Okey-dokey.
740240	741060	Oh, please.
741060	743120	I already told you basically the timeframe.
743120	745060	We're talking the early 1990s.
745060	746120	That's when I was born.
746120	746960	Me too.
746960	747800	In the early 1990s?
747800	749720	Yeah, me and Luke were both born in the early 1990s.
749720	750560	Great.
750560	752560	There'll be all sorts of cultural and technological stuff
752560	754960	that you have absolutely no frame of reference for
754960	756760	for this scenario, which will be fantastic.
756760	757600	Perfect.
757600	759920	Joe and I were born in 89, so we'll be all over it.
759920	760760	Yeah.
760760	762440	We'll flip you guys through this.
762440	764420	Don't worry about it.
764420	765260	We'll follow your lead.
765260	768560	You got a couple of old heads with you, so it'll be fun.
768560	770640	Let's imagine the scene initially.
770640	773360	It is a nondescript office building,
773360	775640	a low rise kind of in the outskirts
775640	778320	of a modestly sized Southern city.
778320	780000	And I already kind of said which state.
780000	781960	We're talking Tennessee.
781960	785260	Zoom in to the building and there's a long conference room,
785260	787720	presumably the largest conference room in the building.
787720	790320	It looks as almost if two walls had been knocked down
790320	792500	and two conference rooms are joined together.
792500	794440	There's a comedically long table
794440	795720	in the middle of this conference room
795720	798520	with about three dozen spinning office chairs.
798760	802560	Those kind of chairs that try to be comfy and soft
802560	805480	are made out of that like shitty fake leather.
805480	808100	And the table is that weird wood
808100	810280	that doesn't quite look like wood.
810280	813920	And the walls, that old fashioned wooden paneling,
813920	815880	the colors match a little bit too much.
815880	818840	It's if anything, a bit unsettling to you.
818840	821600	At one far end of the room, there's a large crest.
821600	822920	It's an FBI logo.
822920	824480	Now the other end of the room
824480	826900	is a pulled down projector screen.
826900	830020	And one of those overhead projectors,
830020	831940	which will be our first technological reference
831940	833380	for those of you who...
833380	835420	So you put a transparency on those
835420	838940	and it shines a light upward and out toward the wall
838940	841220	so you can blow up images and show them to a room.
841220	843620	And this real hot air blows out of it
843620	846580	and it makes this like strange but comforting smell
846580	847820	and you get real sleepy.
847820	850940	I have a memory from when I was like in the womb
850940	853300	of one of those being around me.
853300	855740	My dad was a youth minister when I was growing up
855740	858700	and he would use them to put on song lyrics
858700	861000	for people to sing along for the worship times.
861000	864540	And he would do such parody covers of popular songs
864540	867260	as eight days a week.
867260	869740	Ooh, I need your love, God.
869740	870860	Eight days a week.
872280	873940	Pretty good stuff.
873940	874780	Wow.
874780	876380	Hey, God.
878180	879940	You'll find it's like peeling an onion
879940	881460	with absolutely all of us.
884160	885420	Just a couple of shreks.
885940	888460	And all it took was a reference to an overhead projector
888460	889300	and we got...
889300	891700	And we got completely derailed.
891700	893020	That's fine.
893020	895900	The initial scene setting is over.
895900	896740	No, just kidding.
896740	898060	One last thing about the overhead projector.
898060	901580	If you looked right in the, like the bulb, you were fucked.
901580	902540	Oh yeah.
902540	904380	This is an oversized one
904380	906540	because this is a very large screen it's projecting to.
906540	908840	It's so big that that bulb is still on
908840	909980	from the previous meeting
909980	912400	and you can feel the heat radiating across the room.
912400	913700	It's almost like a space heater.
913700	914820	It's so hot.
915340	918460	It's mid September, middle of the afternoon.
918460	920820	You see beams of light slipping in from the outside
920820	924260	through those slightly ajar hanging kind of floppy curtains
924260	926500	that you open and close with the chain.
926500	927580	It's an old building.
927580	929380	You see little specks of dust in the air
929380	932120	as you just trail off staring at the specks of dust
932120	933740	almost in a trance.
933740	935020	Then suddenly you remember
935020	936660	you're not the only one in this room.
936660	938940	You look around and there's four people
938940	942620	seated around the comedically large conference room table.
942620	944060	And it's the four of you.
944060	945180	Tell me what you see.
945180	946300	Tell me who you are.
946300	949380	This is the opportune time for character introductions.
949380	950900	So let's see.
950900	953900	Who should I cold call on first?
953900	955420	Luke, you're not paying attention.
955420	959260	I saw you looking away from me.
959260	961380	I was looking at my character sheet
961380	963840	hoping that you wouldn't call on me.
963840	964680	Yep, sorry.
964680	966140	I'm calling on you first.
966140	969100	Luke, what do people see in front of them?
969100	973500	Tanner Tan, Daniel Dan Lewd Hyde.
976060	979580	A 38 year old man, kind of thinning hair,
979580	984200	small sunglasses, not quite matrix style,
984200	988180	but like Walmart matrix sunglasses.
988180	993180	He has some like tribal tattoos on his arm.
993740	995360	Doesn't really look like the kind of guy
995360	998340	that would get tattoos, but one arm is just covered in them.
998420	1000880	In the early nineties, that's still really cool.
1002880	1004180	That would be very unique.
1006220	1008840	Yeah, he's just sitting there kind of looking around
1008840	1011140	pretty nervous actually.
1011140	1014820	He has only really been around this just a small amount
1014820	1016720	and he's not sure what to expect.
1016720	1017700	Hi.
1017700	1018540	Joe, you go.
1018540	1021740	Harlan Nash is sitting there next to you.
1021740	1023900	He's got curly black hair.
1023900	1026740	He's got an eye that's kind of has a mind of its own.
1027260	1030260	It's sort of lazy, but it's also kind of there.
1030260	1031340	It can look at you,
1031340	1035580	but it's sometimes just looking past you a little bit.
1035580	1038160	And he's wearing a black polo
1038160	1042160	that's tucked into some cargo pants, lots of pockets.
1042160	1044180	He looks kind of like he was lost in his own world
1044180	1045300	and he hears you say, hey,
1045300	1048100	and he kind of turns back to you.
1049020	1051520	Oh, hello there.
1051520	1053300	I guess we're gonna be working together.
1053300	1054140	I guess so.
1055340	1056220	Who are you?
1056220	1057060	Go for it Zach.
1057060	1060100	Tanner turns to a 63 year old woman
1060100	1065100	who wears every single year in the wrinkles on her face.
1065100	1067480	She has white hair and it's short cropped.
1067480	1071240	It's in like a flat top on top of her head,
1071240	1075860	very shaved close on the sides, very, very flat on top.
1075860	1078100	She's wearing a sleeveless blouse.
1078100	1080940	She has tattoos all over her arms
1080940	1085220	and the tattoos are the chemical compounds
1085260	1087100	of different substances.
1087100	1091980	And she also has just like a skull smoking a joint
1091980	1096340	and there's a coffee pot on her forearm.
1096340	1099580	And she's just got a bunch of different stuff.
1099580	1101780	She's got a tattoo on the back of her neck
1101780	1103300	that just says crystal.
1103300	1105940	She's a very intense looking person.
1105940	1109140	She's wearing platform Doc Martens
1109140	1112540	and that makes her probably like 5'11
1112540	1114740	in those platform boots there.
1115100	1118300	She's got a purse that's doubling as a backpack around her.
1118300	1121020	And as we zoom in on her eyes,
1121020	1123280	we see that they turn back time
1123280	1125320	and she's quite a bit younger.
1125320	1129820	And then we zoom out and we see a team of people
1129820	1131220	and she's wearing a helmet.
1131220	1133020	She's got dog tags around her neck.
1133020	1134700	She has an assault rifle in her hand.
1134700	1136560	It's got a holographic sight.
1136560	1139460	It has targeting lasers and sound suppressors.
1139460	1142280	She has six spare magazines and a chest rig,
1142280	1144340	a medium pistol and a holster,
1144900	1146300	two spare magazines and a chest rig,
1146300	1148740	two frag hand grenades, two smoke grenades,
1148740	1151460	two flash bang stun grenades, a combat knife,
1151460	1154360	flexible cuffs around this tactical body armor.
1154360	1158660	She's wearing a Kevlar helmet and she is ready to go
1158660	1161260	and you see her as she just screams,
1161260	1164020	get down, get down, get down!
1164020	1168240	And then we zoom back out and she's just this old woman
1168240	1172880	in an extremely clean studio apartment.
1173880	1175360	And looking around the apartment,
1175360	1178760	there's a children's drawing that's on the fridge.
1178760	1181640	There's a playpen that's pushed neatly into the corner
1181640	1185160	and the toys have all been collected and put away.
1185160	1188080	And Cindy, Cindy Woodabaga,
1188080	1191960	sits down on the toilet and takes a shit
1191960	1193680	and she pulls out her phone
1193680	1198120	and she Googles her own name, Cindy Woodabaga.
1198160	1203100	And all of these Google results come up of the trial.
1203100	1204280	So this is in the future?
1204280	1206880	Yeah, this is a great way to ensure your character survives
1206880	1209500	by including a moment where she's shitting
1209500	1214500	with a smartphone 25 to 30 years after
1214600	1215840	the setting of our current campaign.
1215840	1218160	No, she is 63 years old in the room.
1218160	1221240	So she's reading a newspaper article while she shits.
1221240	1224760	Oh, right, yeah, she's got a big newspaper
1224760	1227280	in front of her while she's taking a shit.
1227320	1229400	Sorry, ah.
1229400	1231960	And so she's holding this newspaper up
1231960	1235600	and her eyes narrow as she reads this article
1235600	1239920	about Cindy Woodabaga and she was on trial for murder.
1239920	1243240	She was on trial for murdering her husband.
1243240	1248040	The case was thrown out due to some mishandling of evidence.
1248040	1252600	And she finishes up, wipes, and puts the newspaper away
1252600	1254520	and heads off to this meeting.
1254520	1257640	And some fingers kind of snap in front of her eyes
1257640	1261440	and her partner, Jodine, DEA.
1261440	1265400	You're gonna have to excuse my partner, Agent Woodabaga.
1265400	1266220	Woodabaga.
1266220	1271220	Sometimes, you know, her eyes, they seem to turn back time.
1271800	1273880	She gets a little lost in her memories.
1273880	1276640	I assure you, she's a very effective field agent,
1276640	1277800	one of the best we have.
1277800	1281460	I've worked with her for quite a while now.
1282340	1286620	So, Jodine is dressed a lot like Harlan Nash,
1286620	1290820	except he's in a white polo with cargo pants.
1290820	1294600	And he even says, like, I like your polo.
1294600	1295540	Very professional.
1296820	1298220	Thank you.
1298220	1302540	He's 39, but he looks about 45, graying everywhere.
1302540	1305260	It looks like he's recently lost a lot of hair
1305260	1307100	in the last seven or eight months.
1307100	1310140	And he's about 5'5", so you can't really tell
1310140	1311420	when they're sitting at the table,
1312340	1313620	but if they sat up, Cindy Woodabaga
1313620	1315300	would just tower over him.
1315300	1319300	He says, again, I do wanna apologize for my partner.
1319300	1321980	Sometimes she just goes, you know.
1321980	1324620	It's the analytical investigative mind
1324620	1327560	that makes her such an effective crime fighter.
1327560	1331460	And you kinda just gotta roll with these unorthodox methods.
1331460	1333380	What's happening now is that her,
1333380	1335840	she looked, well, don't look too hard,
1335840	1337100	but look into her eyes.
1337100	1340720	Hey, how many of these have you guys been on?
1341580	1343080	This is my first.
1344760	1347060	This is my first in an official capacity.
1347060	1350260	It's, I've been exposed.
1350260	1351100	Me too.
1351900	1352900	What's that mean?
1352900	1353720	Which one?
1353720	1356820	That one, and it's like some chemical compound.
1356820	1357740	It's morphine.
1357740	1359860	That's interesting.
1359860	1364060	This one is Japanese for perseverance.
1364060	1365660	If you knew Japanese, you would know
1365660	1368740	that it's actually a Chinese symbol that says crab.
1368780	1369620	Yeah.
1371460	1372920	Which roughly translates.
1375660	1378140	I wanna play the Cindy scenario, actually.
1378140	1378980	Is that okay?
1378980	1380900	Can we go back to the flashback?
1380900	1381740	Sure.
1381740	1382820	Are you fully prepped there, Zach?
1382820	1383660	Oh yeah.
1383660	1384480	Can you run that?
1384480	1385320	I can roll up a quick character.
1385320	1386660	It did sound like he had enough equipment
1386660	1387820	for the rest of us.
1389100	1392380	She was on the DEA's FAST team,
1392380	1396060	which is the Foreign Deployed Advisory Support Team,
1396060	1399320	which was paramilitary units in far-flung areas
1399320	1402380	of the world where narcotics are grown and processed.
1402380	1405020	But that was a long time ago,
1405020	1409980	and now she is just a desk jockey with Joe Dean here,
1409980	1413700	but they got pulled into Delta Green about,
1413700	1414920	what, six months ago?
1414920	1417080	Yeah, I imagine pretty soon after.
1417080	1419620	Also, if you're new to us,
1419620	1422660	can you tell which one, new listeners, is the DM?
1422780	1423620	Pfft.
1425620	1426460	It's Luke.
1427580	1428420	Yep.
1430220	1432540	All right, so you're all there now.
1432540	1433460	You're in the room.
1433460	1437700	You snapped out of your dust-fueled sunlight trance.
1437700	1439100	This conversation happened.
1439100	1442060	The two of you that know each other, great.
1442060	1444680	You've also met the two new folks that are here as well.
1444680	1447320	Behind your chairs, you all have bags.
1447320	1449060	You just flew in this morning.
1449060	1452660	This is the FBI field office in Memphis, Tennessee,
1452660	1457580	and you were summoned here by an FBI agent, James Derringer.
1457580	1458960	You checked in.
1458960	1461100	This is, again, all pre-9-11, right?
1461100	1463200	So security, pretty lax.
1463200	1465340	You showed up, you flashed some random ID,
1465340	1466580	they give you a visitor badge,
1466580	1469660	and you were just strolling around an FBI field office.
1469660	1471460	And you went to this room,
1471460	1473180	but you've been waiting for a while,
1473180	1475260	and waiting, and waiting, and waiting.
1475260	1477700	And eventually, what seems like could have been
1477700	1480180	over an hour of waiting for this guy,
1480180	1484140	he finally busts into the room in a hurry.
1484140	1487140	You see this man, relatively tall, lean,
1487140	1489340	and with very deep set eyes.
1489340	1493180	And as he walks in, there's just a grimace on his face.
1493180	1497460	Just this almost persistent, I guess,
1497460	1499900	resting bitch face kind of thing going on with him.
1499900	1502580	What's the early 90s turn for resting bitch face?
1502580	1503620	Yeah, that's the problem.
1503620	1506180	I mean, we can't refer to pumpkin spice,
1506180	1508460	he's not sipping a pumpkin spice latte,
1508460	1510380	wearing Uggs or anything else.
1510380	1511220	I mean, they're...
1511220	1513420	He looks like a sour puss.
1513420	1515020	He looks like a sour puss, and he busts in,
1515020	1517660	and he's, oh, agents.
1517660	1519860	Thanks for finally making it.
1519860	1524820	I've got something that I need to keep off the FBI,
1524820	1526180	say, radar for a bit.
1526180	1530340	And I think your unique backgrounds probably can help.
1530340	1532940	Before I get too much into it, let me just show you.
1532940	1535980	So he rolls over a TV on a cart,
1536620	1539340	one of those big CRT, 30-inch TVs
1539340	1542780	that probably weighs 80 pounds back then,
1542780	1544780	cart with a strap over the top,
1544780	1547420	kind of reels that over, there's a VCR.
1547420	1549140	Agent Dean immediately runs over
1549140	1551780	to help him plug in cables.
1551780	1554420	Oh, I always get the yellow video mixed up
1554420	1556700	with the white audio. Channel three, channel three.
1556700	1559980	Oh yeah, Cindy looks over at Tanner and is like,
1559980	1562860	are we gonna watch some Magic School Bus, you think?
1563860	1566140	I don't think we will be.
1566140	1567300	Do you think so?
1567300	1572060	I'll tell you what, this isn't some Magic School Bus.
1572060	1573100	Hits play.
1573100	1576260	Security footage starts playing at a gas station,
1576260	1577100	it looks like.
1577100	1578940	It's just one of those overhead cameras
1578940	1581380	kind of angled at the cashier.
1581380	1583740	And cashier's just there kind of standing,
1583740	1585580	chilling, organizing some stuff.
1585580	1589300	And a young man approaches the counter looking agitated.
1589300	1591260	He says something to the cashier.
1591260	1592780	The cashier says something back.
1593660	1595100	You can't hear anything because there's no audio.
1595100	1597700	This is crappy, low resolution,
1597700	1600220	constantly looping security footage.
1600220	1602740	But he says something and then the cashier just stares
1602740	1603940	at him very blankly,
1603940	1606460	like not quite understanding what he's saying.
1606460	1610500	Then you see the young man wind up with his fist,
1610500	1611740	just like a normal punch,
1611740	1613540	going to punch this guy in the head.
1614780	1617700	He makes contact, but you can see from the impact,
1617700	1619700	the guy's head almost deflates.
1619700	1621980	His skull instantly shatters.
1622020	1624300	And as the punch continues to connect,
1624300	1626420	the head gets knocked cleanly off the body.
1626420	1627260	Holy shit.
1629460	1633100	So skull crushed, head pops off,
1633100	1635660	head hits the back wall, flops down.
1635660	1638180	The body's kind of there stumbling a bit,
1638180	1641740	blood squirting out of the stump, if you will,
1641740	1643460	that is his neck.
1643460	1646980	And then the body just falls and collapses.
1646980	1651900	The young man steps back with a look of shock.
1652820	1653660	And then steps forward,
1653660	1654980	hits some keys on the cash register,
1654980	1658340	pulls out all the cash he can, runs off screen.
1658340	1660060	Then you see him come back into frame,
1660060	1662420	basically as he's walking out of the gas station
1662420	1664220	with a bunch of pill bottles.
1664220	1666940	Money in one hand, pill bottles in his arms,
1666940	1671580	and then rushes off camera, presumably leaving the scene.
1671580	1672580	And that's actually gonna give us
1672580	1674540	our first roll of the evening.
1674540	1678540	Roll me some sanity for that neck you just saw.
1678540	1679980	That was intense.
1679980	1681700	Fail, fail.
1682340	1683180	Pass, 39 on a 40,
1683180	1684900	but Jodine still definitely vomits
1684900	1686420	on the conference room floor.
1687420	1690140	Harlan fails, that's an 82 on a 50.
1690140	1691580	All right, if you pass, it's a zero,
1691580	1695460	but all you failures, one point of sanity damage.
1695460	1698620	So you see this, the tape ends.
1698620	1701620	Agent Derringer sees the vomit on the table.
1701620	1703100	It's like, ah, rookie.
1703100	1705020	I guess we all gotta start somewhere,
1705020	1707220	but we got pulled into this.
1707220	1709420	He held up six gas stations and drugstores
1709420	1710940	in the last two weeks.
1710980	1713380	First here in Tennessee, then he crossed state lines,
1713380	1716620	bringing us into it, into Alabama, then Georgia.
1716620	1719500	We eventually got him, took some bullets,
1719500	1721740	but we managed to get him, and we have him here.
1721740	1723660	He's downstairs and holding.
1723660	1724620	He's alive.
1724620	1725940	He's alive.
1725940	1727780	Took four MP5 bullets.
1728620	1731700	And that slowed him down just enough for us
1731700	1732580	to restrain him.
1732580	1733900	Center mass or?
1733900	1736140	Yes, four center mass bullets.
1736140	1737500	We got him.
1737500	1739380	We got agents downstairs watching him.
1739380	1741260	Let me warn you, first and foremost,
1741260	1742540	not everyone here is your friend.
1742540	1744740	Those agents down there in the room with them,
1744740	1745900	they're not part of this.
1745900	1747900	So be careful what you say in front of them.
1747900	1751740	Two, the reason you're here, this is a drug investigation.
1751740	1755460	The cover story is this kid went on a crime spree
1755460	1757540	because something went south with some drug dealers
1757540	1758780	he was dealing with.
1758780	1762100	He needed to score meds, some money to pay him back.
1762100	1763540	I don't think that's the case,
1763540	1767180	but that's how we can get DEA agents, a marshal,
1767180	1769180	someone who's good at tracking
1769180	1772340	and investigating, ATF agent as well.
1772340	1774580	But the whole point is you're keeping this
1774580	1776260	off the FBI's radar.
1776260	1777820	You've got about a week.
1777820	1779180	Be careful calling me here.
1779180	1781860	If I have anything for you, I will send you a courier.
1781860	1784660	I'll send someone out to you with any message,
1784660	1786420	but we're gonna need a password,
1786420	1788180	a secret phrase, if you will.
1788180	1789540	Any suggestions?
1789540	1791420	Bubble gum tree?
1791420	1792780	Bubble gum tree it is.
1792780	1794260	Yeah, that's strange.
1794260	1795100	ESPN.
1797780	1799620	I just got that.
1799620	1802780	I don't miss much college football anymore.
1802780	1804540	I'll brief you more once we get down there,
1804540	1805980	if you wanna check this guy out.
1805980	1807420	Do you have any questions for me now though,
1807420	1809540	before we go in front of those guards and stuff?
1809540	1810820	Harlan raises his hand.
1810820	1814140	Has anybody seen this footage other than you and us?
1814140	1815340	No.
1815340	1818100	So the agents downstairs, they don't know about
1818100	1820220	the strength that this man might possess?
1820220	1822260	Oh no, they know he's dangerous.
1822260	1823900	In fact, the three agents downstairs
1823900	1826740	were part of who apprehended him.
1827140	1830420	It was basically a roadblock in Georgia
1830420	1831540	when we finally stopped him.
1831540	1832780	He had stolen a car.
1832780	1834860	We managed to spike strip the car down,
1834860	1836500	got him out of the car.
1836500	1840140	Several FBI agents plus a state trooper shot at him.
1840140	1841780	That's when they finally got him.
1841780	1844460	But before they even got those four bullets into him,
1844460	1848500	he got to a trooper, grabbed his shotgun
1848500	1851660	and was able to basically bend it in half.
1851660	1853820	So these guys have seen his strength.
1853820	1856700	Bugs Bunny, Elmer Fudd, it is his shotgun.
1856700	1857620	That's what you're telling me?
1857620	1858460	Yeah.
1858460	1860060	They know if he gets out of his restraints,
1860060	1861100	they're in trouble.
1861100	1861940	Well, we can see-
1861940	1863100	Dad orders.
1863100	1864260	Well, sorry.
1864260	1865100	It was a little delay.
1865100	1865940	No, I just missed it.
1868020	1869780	Could you both sit down for a second?
1869780	1870620	Yeah, sorry.
1870620	1871460	You're getting very hyped.
1871460	1874780	I can't stop fiddling with this cables.
1874780	1876900	How many heads did he pop off?
1876900	1878780	It all started with his dad actually.
1880020	1883100	He went missing, gone from home for about two days.
1883100	1884660	This was eight days ago.
1884660	1887900	Boy went missing, showed back up two days later,
1887900	1889500	no clue where he was.
1889500	1891260	He was in a lot of pain.
1891260	1892580	Parents put him to bed.
1892580	1895820	Couple hours later, his dad heard his crying,
1895820	1898900	went to check on him, touched him on the shoulder,
1898900	1900980	asked him if he was okay.
1900980	1904180	Boy turns around, punches him right through the chest,
1905140	1907540	blows a hole about a foot wide
1907540	1911140	right through the center of his chest, dies instantly.
1912140	1914980	Kid hops up, runs out of the house.
1914980	1916820	That's when the crime spree started.
1916820	1918820	How old is the suspect?
1918820	1919660	18.
1919660	1920500	What's his name?
1920500	1923540	His name's Billy Ray Spivey.
1923540	1925340	Just graduated from high school.
1925340	1928900	Recently applied for a job at the local Saturn Auto plant
1928900	1931580	about an hour south of his town.
1931580	1933740	Child of Rich and Angel Spivey.
1933740	1936780	Has anybody tested him for drugs?
1936780	1937620	PZP?
1937620	1938460	We're running tests.
1938460	1940900	Who's gonna have access to those blood results?
1941500	1942340	Just me to start.
1942340	1944020	Let's probably keep it that way for a minute.
1944020	1944860	Yeah.
1944860	1948060	To answer your other question, no drugs.
1948060	1949460	No drugs in his system.
1949460	1951020	Outside of the stuff he'd been stealing.
1951020	1954340	He'd been stealing pain meds at a lot of these pharmacies.
1954340	1956300	Was he taking them or trying to sell them?
1956300	1957780	Taking them.
1957780	1958740	A lot of them.
1958740	1961260	Did he have a previous criminal record?
1961260	1962220	No record at all.
1963140	1964660	No record at all.
1964660	1966140	That's why it doesn't make much sense.
1966140	1970300	Town he's from, Groversville, small town, 1200 people.
1970300	1972020	Itty bitty tiny town.
1972020	1973460	Not much crime there.
1973460	1976020	Even this whole drug angle's gonna look kinda weak there.
1976020	1978220	But it's what we gotta go with a lot better
1978220	1980820	than people running around with superhuman strength
1980820	1982400	punching people's heads off.
1982400	1983700	Generally the public doesn't like that.
1983700	1986380	Well before I started working with my new partner,
1986380	1989520	I did a little public relations.
1989520	1993220	We've got folks pretty well terrified of methamphetamine.
1993220	1996980	I think we can say this is some kinda strange super myth
1996980	1998660	my partner and I are investigating.
1998660	2001780	Especially if the blood results stay between
2001780	2003340	the three of us.
2003340	2004860	Well, and these two.
2004860	2006580	No, we're running all sorts of tests.
2006580	2009500	I'll show you a bit more when we get down there.
2009500	2011180	How do you have him restrained?
2011180	2015760	He is in a chair with dozens of sets of handcuffs,
2015760	2017480	various chains.
2017480	2019060	He looks basically like a mummy
2019060	2021660	wrapped into that chair with metal.
2021660	2024340	And he's heavily sedated right now.
2024340	2026060	That boy wakes up fully.
2026060	2028020	He's even gonna break through all those cuffs.
2028060	2030300	Well we better get to him quick then.
2030300	2031740	You wanna check him out?
2031740	2032940	Let's go look at him.
2032940	2034280	Y'all bust out of the conference room.
2034280	2035820	He takes you to an elevator.
2035820	2038180	You're on like the second or third floor now.
2038180	2041440	You go down, ground floor, basement,
2041440	2043860	and then the sub-basement of this building.
2043860	2046540	That's like the secure, secure part of the building.
2046540	2047940	That's where 15 years from now,
2047940	2049140	where all the servers will be
2049140	2051540	when they actually have real computers and stuff.
2051540	2053700	Right now that's presumably where they keep all the weapons
2053700	2057820	and the terrible superhuman strength murderers.
2058780	2060220	It's a good combo.
2060220	2062940	He leads you into a room though, heavy steel door.
2062940	2065420	You walk inside and it's exactly what he described,
2065420	2068780	which is the chair, guy bolted down into it,
2068780	2070940	and then three guys with assault rifles
2070940	2072380	pointed directly at him.
2072380	2075620	They're body armored up, a SWAT team basically,
2075620	2076920	trained on this guy.
2077840	2081420	And he's there, just in his chair, kind of loopy.
2081420	2084580	Do any of you have medicine over 20?
2084580	2085420	Nope.
2085420	2086260	No.
2086260	2087460	Nope.
2087460	2090280	Humint over 40.
2090280	2091120	Yes.
2091120	2091940	Yep.
2091940	2092780	Great.
2092780	2093620	With the Humint over 40,
2093620	2098500	it is the telltale signs of him being heavily sedated.
2098500	2101180	Almost half asleep, his eyes are droopy,
2101180	2102700	a little bloodshot,
2102700	2107420	and he's just kind of rocking back and forth in the chair.
2107420	2109500	Poor kid didn't know what he was getting into.
2109500	2112380	He thought that he learned something new
2112380	2115700	or just got caught up in it and then killed his own dad.
2115700	2117100	How could you say poor kid?
2117100	2119020	He murdered people. Can you fucking imagine?
2119020	2121260	Yeah, but from his perspective, he doesn't know.
2121260	2122260	What do you mean he doesn't know?
2122260	2123380	He did it.
2123380	2125460	Yeah, but if he was gone, missing for a while,
2125460	2127260	who knows what kind of state he was in
2127260	2128460	when he did all that stuff.
2128460	2130560	He was in three states, actually.
2132860	2133860	That is correct.
2134940	2135860	Why'd you do it?
2139500	2144500	Uh, it hurts, it hurts.
2145380	2146580	What hurts?
2146580	2147660	Everything.
2147660	2149300	I forgot you got shot four times.
2149300	2151140	That probably doesn't feel too good, does it?
2151140	2152620	That's not what hurts though, is it?
2152620	2157620	No, my arms, my legs, everything hurts.
2161000	2162540	Where were you?
2162540	2164420	Where were you when you went missing?
2164420	2165580	I don't know.
2165580	2168020	You fucking tell me right now, where were you?
2168020	2172140	She like shakes his face and Joe pulls her off.
2172140	2175660	I don't know where I was and then I came back
2175660	2180460	and it just, everything hurts so much and I'm so hungry.
2180460	2182820	Is that why you were stealing the drugs?
2182820	2183700	Because you hurt?
2183700	2186660	Yes, yes, nothing helps.
2186660	2188620	You know what from?
2188620	2189460	Are you sick?
2191700	2193420	I don't know.
2193420	2195100	I just want the pain to stop.
2195100	2196780	Harlan's gonna kind of part the crowd
2196780	2198820	and get real close to his face.
2198820	2203500	Can you remember the last thing you remember
2203500	2205260	before you don't remember?
2208260	2209420	Lights.
2209420	2211540	What kind of lights, street lights?
2211540	2215180	I don't, bright, I don't know.
2215180	2216700	You said you didn't know where you were,
2216700	2218820	but could you describe where you were?
2219900	2224900	No, I woke up in my car going to see my girlfriend
2225780	2227900	and I don't know.
2227900	2229820	What's your girlfriend's name?
2229820	2232780	Her name's Jane, Jane Allen.
2232780	2237260	I miss her, I haven't seen her in over a week now.
2237260	2238860	Maybe we should get Jane on the phone
2238860	2240540	and see what she knows.
2240540	2242460	We actually, we have had Jane on the phone.
2242460	2244260	She misses you and she wants to talk to you,
2244260	2246500	but we can't really let that happen unless,
2246500	2249020	unless you really fully answer all our questions.
2249020	2252900	I don't know what to answer, I just want the pain to stop.
2252900	2255300	Okay, well, did anything strange
2255300	2258180	or out of the ordinary happen in the week
2258180	2260940	leading up to you disappearing?
2260940	2263020	I don't think so.
2263020	2265700	You don't remember anything out of the ordinary?
2265700	2268020	No, I applied for a job.
2268020	2269180	At the Saturn plant?
2269180	2273500	Yeah, the sat, I just wanted to build cars like my daddy.
2273500	2275100	Where did your daddy build cars?
2275100	2276420	At the Saturn plant.
2278260	2280020	Just like your daddy, all right.
2280020	2281340	Just like my daddy.
2281380	2283180	So you went there and applied in person?
2283180	2284020	Yes.
2284020	2286260	Which is of course the only way to do it right now.
2286260	2288460	Correct, and where's he now?
2290020	2292580	Your dad, your father.
2296060	2296900	What'd you do?
2297980	2299460	What'd you do to your dad?
2299460	2301660	Rutabaga, Agent Rutabaga.
2301660	2303940	Harland's gonna put a hand on Rutabaga.
2303940	2307900	Hey, that's not necessary.
2307900	2309420	Hey, sorry, I just thought it would,
2309420	2311700	maybe they'll just like punch something out of him.
2311700	2313780	Yeah, but he killed his dad.
2313780	2315580	I don't feel sorry for this guy.
2315580	2317620	You don't have to feel sorry.
2317620	2320420	Sidebar, y'all, quick sidebar.
2320420	2323140	Have you ever fucking interrogated?
2323140	2325180	I'd like my colleagues to step into the hallway with me.
2325180	2326180	I follow.
2326180	2327380	What was your name?
2327380	2328740	You can call me Tan.
2328740	2329580	Tan.
2329580	2330420	Yeah, Tanner.
2330420	2332020	Yeah, what was your investigative background?
2333220	2338220	Well, I'm in the ATF,
2339100	2339940	so-
2339940	2341100	Is this your first week?
2342380	2344260	In this kind of situation,
2344260	2347340	I ain't never seen punched in the heads off or nothing.
2347340	2351780	Mostly, you know, alcohol, tobacco, and firearms, really.
2353540	2355220	I'm sure at no time in the near future
2355220	2358180	will the ATF get involved in anything hairier than that.
2361700	2364180	I'm taking a trip to Waco later.
2364500	2365660	Uh-oh, uh-oh.
2366700	2369660	All right, so y'all know about,
2370940	2372540	yeah, yeah, well, you don't have to say it.
2372540	2374660	You know about the stuff, right, the spooky stuff?
2374660	2375620	I'm aware.
2375620	2378420	Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's kind of scary.
2378420	2380180	Don't you think a kid punching a hole
2380180	2381660	through his daddy's chest
2381660	2383620	and then a cashier's head clean off,
2383620	2385780	is that normal to you or is that spooky?
2385780	2386940	It is spooky.
2386940	2389780	Yeah, so we're here to investigate the spooky shit,
2390940	2392740	figure out why it's happening,
2392780	2394100	and keep it fucking quiet
2394100	2397340	from all the people who don't know about the spooky shit.
2397340	2399740	It doesn't matter if you sympathize with this dude
2399740	2402340	for punching a hole in his daddy or not.
2402340	2403580	When you're investigating a perp,
2403580	2407380	you gotta use advanced psychology
2407380	2409300	to make him think you're on his side
2409300	2410460	or sometimes threaten him.
2410460	2413540	Okay, okay, I'm gonna try a second approach.
2413540	2415380	Yeah, Rutabaga, you need to calm down.
2415380	2417260	Rutabaga, and so she takes her bagpipe off.
2417260	2418860	Is that your speech impediment or your name?
2418860	2421260	No, my name is W, Rutabaga.
2422740	2423580	Yeah.
2424980	2426340	She takes off her backpack,
2426340	2428140	which is like a purse that she has
2428140	2430780	a bunch of random stuff in.
2430780	2434500	She grabs a cardigan out of it and some cheaters.
2434500	2436740	She throws the cardigan on over her blouse,
2436740	2438700	covering up all of her tattoos,
2438700	2442420	and throws on these little gas station glasses
2442420	2444180	with a long chain on them.
2444180	2445020	Cheaters?
2445020	2445840	Yeah, cheaters.
2445840	2447660	Yeah, like reader glasses.
2447660	2448500	Just magnified glasses?
2448500	2450780	Yeah, but they're not like, they're not real glasses,
2450780	2452320	they're not prescription, they're just cheaters.
2453280	2456440	She puts on this get up with her reading glasses,
2456440	2459440	not cheaters, and her cardigan.
2459440	2462680	She is gonna head back into the room
2462680	2464620	with a much different demeanor.
2466240	2469440	Well, hello there, Sonny.
2469440	2473480	I just wanted to talk to you, Billy Ray, for just a moment.
2473480	2475360	I hold the others briefly back at the door.
2475360	2478480	I'm like, as crazy as this seems, I seen it work.
2478480	2480520	Especially with a sedated boy like this,
2480520	2483560	he's probably not gonna know it's the same lady.
2484680	2486560	It's the real magic of this wild card.
2486560	2487840	Billy Ray.
2487840	2489440	Grandma?
2489440	2491320	Yeah, that's right.
2491320	2492160	Is that you?
2492160	2495280	That's right, it's good to see you again, boy.
2495280	2497560	But you're dead.
2499680	2502700	Well, the Lord works in mysterious ways.
2502700	2507320	I'm here to help you figure out what happened.
2507320	2508160	Okay.
2508920	2513160	So let's close your eyes nice and tight.
2513160	2516720	And she pinches both of his cheeks lovingly,
2516720	2519560	just like very soft, in a comfortable way.
2519560	2520920	This isn't weird.
2520920	2525920	And she says, now close your eyes and think real hard-like.
2529800	2530640	Good.
2532920	2533760	Good.
2533760	2535160	Good.
2535160	2538160	And she just wants to get him like in a relaxed state
2538160	2540760	in order to hopefully just gain
2540760	2543440	one more pertinent piece of information here.
2543440	2546120	Sure, I like that.
2546120	2548160	Give me a persuade roll with that.
2548160	2549560	Okay.
2549560	2550900	35 on a 60.
2550900	2551800	All right, great.
2553560	2558560	The lights everywhere, they cut me all over my body.
2561280	2563480	Tiny little cuts everywhere.
2564640	2569640	My legs, my arms, everywhere where it hurts, cuts.
2570340	2573280	Does he have any like visible cuts that we can see?
2573280	2576440	Give me a search roll.
2578400	2581760	Past 10 on a 50.
2581760	2583300	Yeah, 42 on a 70.
2584660	2586480	22 on a 15.
2586480	2587480	22? Crit success.
2587480	2588380	Yeah, hell yeah.
2588380	2589220	Great.
2589220	2593000	So the whole time that he was talking,
2593080	2595080	she was like turning back toward them
2595080	2599800	and slowly like giving them the come here with her hand.
2599800	2602720	So they all like creep into the room behind her
2602720	2606440	as he's like talking with his eyes closed.
2608760	2611120	And you're, yeah, you're just like looking at his wrists
2611120	2612960	in his ankles and everything.
2612960	2617320	He's wearing a pair of a jean cut off shorts,
2617320	2618960	old beat up Chuck Taylors
2618960	2622680	and a even more beat up Metallica t-shirt.
2623600	2625120	But yeah, you look closely,
2625120	2627960	especially Joe Dean with that crit success.
2627960	2630320	You see the tiniest of incisions.
2630320	2634840	They look almost like a relatively large needle poke
2634840	2638240	that has been kind of healed over, almost laser like.
2638240	2642960	Randomly spaced out all along his arms, all along his legs.
2642960	2645200	Basically when you look very, very, very closely,
2645200	2647100	they look almost like hair follicles.
2647460	2648300	Mm.
2648300	2649460	But bigger.
2649460	2651860	Initially they didn't see him on their inspection.
2651860	2654540	Can we pull back his collar on his shirt
2654540	2657100	to see if they're on his neck and back?
2657100	2658420	His pussy and his crack.
2663420	2666120	Does he have tiny cuts on his pussy, David?
2667740	2668820	The answer is yes.
2671020	2671980	Yeah, all over him.
2671980	2675340	Basically anywhere there's musculature on his body,
2675340	2678980	there seems to be these random pricks.
2678980	2681660	They're a little more concentrated in areas of heavy muscle
2681660	2685420	like around his calves and thighs, biceps,
2685420	2688500	and then a little less so in other areas like his hands,
2688500	2690100	but it's all still there.
2690100	2692120	Harlan is still kind of toward the back of the room
2692120	2695140	and he wants to grab James Derringer
2695140	2697260	and just pull him into the hallway real quick.
2697260	2700300	Has anyone X-rayed this boy?
2700300	2701780	He looks around to make sure no one's listening
2701780	2703920	because you still are in the hallway of an FBI building
2703960	2705800	and wants to make sure no one is around.
2705800	2708220	It's like, yeah, we're gonna run those tests too.
2708220	2709920	We took tissue samples though.
2709920	2714360	We did notice some of these operating sites.
2714360	2715400	Took tissue samples.
2715400	2717240	They've already been sent to a lab.
2717240	2719200	I'll make sure to get the results.
2719200	2722280	I will send someone with the results once I have them,
2722280	2723960	but it could be a couple of days.
2723960	2726440	And when you initially took these samples,
2726440	2730680	was the rate of healing consistent with an eight day period?
2730680	2733160	There's something odd about the boy's muscle.
2733160	2734600	We're not sure what it is,
2734600	2737520	but as far as we can tell from the tests we've done,
2737520	2739520	his skeleton's been unchanged.
2739520	2741080	It's only his muscle.
2741080	2743720	We think the superhuman strength,
2743720	2748160	if he were to say, try to pick up a car, he probably could,
2748160	2750680	but then his bones would snap under the weight.
2750680	2754820	So we think that's the limits of this boy's ability.
2754820	2756320	That's all we know now though.
2756320	2757880	We're gonna wait for the tests.
2757880	2759720	Needless to say, we wanna be in the know
2759720	2761800	as soon as those results come in.
2761800	2764800	Of course, you're my eyes and ears on the ground.
2764800	2766920	Joe Dean steps out in the hallway too.
2766920	2769120	And I guess we'll say you catch him up quickly on that.
2769120	2774000	Anyway, he says, is there a friendly doctor in town?
2774000	2776660	Is there someone you could get into this sub-basement
2776660	2780880	who could be trusted that could run some more expediated,
2780880	2783520	perhaps radical tests?
2783520	2786400	Not gonna be any faster.
2786400	2789280	I have a friendly doctor on the case though.
2789280	2790920	I'm not even leaving it to chance
2790920	2792900	of some Miranda running these tests.
2792900	2794600	That's part of why it's gonna take a little longer
2794600	2796360	is I want fewer eyes on this.
2796360	2799560	Well, how would you feel if we went in there
2799560	2801680	with some tweezers and a magnifying glass
2801680	2804160	and just dug around one of those injection sites
2804160	2805480	and saw what we could see?
2806360	2808260	See if we couldn't pull anything out?
2809960	2814340	Boy's dangerous, but if you want to, you can go for it.
2814780	2818660	I'm still in there rubbing his cheeks.
2819940	2822460	Tan has wandered out into the hallway too.
2822460	2824400	Also quickly gets caught up.
2824400	2826340	Tan, here's the rundown.
2826340	2827220	Oh, thanks.
2827220	2829460	Have we given him any painkillers?
2829460	2831600	Like try to put him at ease.
2831600	2833420	Is he, he's on him right now?
2833420	2838300	He's been robbing and popping pain pills this whole way
2838300	2839140	and they ain't helping him.
2839140	2840480	Well, I guess it can't hurt too bad
2840480	2841740	to dig around in there then.
2841740	2844020	This boy is on enough morphine right now
2844620	2846220	to kill most people.
2846220	2849200	I don't know that digging around is necessary.
2849200	2851060	We've already, they've taken tissue samples.
2851060	2852100	I assume you would have said
2852100	2854340	if you found something in those samples, correct?
2854340	2855580	They've taken tissue samples
2855580	2856840	and they're gonna get all the results
2856840	2857980	in a couple of days, right?
2857980	2859500	But we could just see with our own eyes.
2859500	2862240	I want to see what's in one of them holes.
2862240	2863340	I mean, they would have told us
2863340	2865180	if there was something in a hole, wouldn't they have?
2865180	2866820	There's only one way to find out.
2866820	2870780	I assume it takes a complicated series of phone calls
2870780	2873740	and faxes, perhaps even hand sent letters to.
2874300	2875700	So what are you gonna do then?
2875700	2878020	Are you saying the phone calls and hand sent letters
2878020	2881900	for consent to operate on him in the basement or?
2881900	2883500	Oh, no, no, no, none of that.
2883500	2884340	I just meant.
2884340	2885580	Oh, okay.
2885580	2887120	Yeah, so Joe's question is
2887120	2888420	they've already taken a tissue sample.
2888420	2890220	Did they find anything in those sites?
2890220	2891140	So we don't know yet.
2891140	2893360	But we're not gonna know that for a while, right?
2893360	2894420	It's muscle tissue.
2894420	2898500	It looks largely similar to normal muscle tissue,
2898500	2901440	but yeah, you're not gonna know for a couple of days.
2901760	2904560	Your plan is to use a tweezer or magnifying glass.
2904560	2907920	I'm just asking how they would have seen as much of that
2907920	2910480	as you would in this moment, right?
2910480	2912320	That's a question for him.
2912320	2914720	Is that information included in that report
2914720	2915640	that you have so far?
2915640	2918760	Yes, there's probably nothing more you can learn.
2918760	2922280	However, if you want to dig around in the wounds
2922280	2927280	of an incredibly dangerous multi-state killer.
2927280	2928120	Yeah, it's on the table.
2928120	2929240	We could go digging.
2929240	2931060	It's your funeral, as they say.
2932440	2934920	Maybe there's a gooey duck in there.
2934920	2937080	That would be an odd place for a gooey duck.
2939680	2941120	You know, sometimes you get the genius
2941120	2942320	of the grandma routine,
2942320	2944360	and sometimes it's just shit like that.
2944360	2945680	That's why I'm doing great.
2945680	2947360	It's so random.
2949720	2952280	I think I've got you up to speed here.
2952280	2954160	The only other thing you need to know,
2954160	2956080	he's not the only one that's reported
2956080	2958360	going missing in Grover'sville.
2958360	2960440	That's pertinent information.
2960520	2963440	There's been a series of similar disappearances.
2963440	2965480	How many is a series?
2965480	2966960	It's mostly anecdotal,
2966960	2971160	but we've heard from him in his delirium
2971160	2974200	about this happening to some of his friends and stuff.
2974200	2975040	It's strange.
2975040	2977360	It's a weird town, to be honest.
2977360	2979920	Small town, 1200 people.
2979920	2984480	It's the butt end of a lot of UFO conspiracy jokes.
2984480	2986800	You know, shows up in the tabloids.
2986800	2988040	Weird place.
2988040	2989600	And what is the name of that town again?
2989600	2990440	Grover'sville.
2990440	2991880	Grover'sville.
2992840	2994520	The UFO conspiracy stuff,
2994520	2996920	what does that date back to?
2996920	2999040	No, it's been going on for years.
2999040	3002320	You know, it's just random crackpot stories,
3002320	3004880	moronic ideas.
3004880	3007360	Place is just the butt end of regional
3007360	3009240	and even national news headlines.
3009240	3011120	You like that term butt end.
3011120	3013240	Butt end.
3016560	3019120	Did he give any names of people
3019560	3021360	he knows that got disappeared too?
3021360	3022440	Nah, I don't know.
3022440	3023840	He's worried about his girlfriend.
3023840	3027560	Yeah, do we have Jane Allen's contact information?
3027560	3029440	Yeah, we can get that for you.
3029440	3031800	Do you have some sort of portable telephone device
3031800	3035520	or a telephone that I can call Jane on?
3035520	3036920	I wish we had the government funding
3036920	3039320	for those glorious devices.
3039320	3042040	Well, the DEA car,
3042040	3046080	we came down in here and it does have a car phone.
3046080	3051080	Wow, you got one of those new ones.
3051240	3054720	Well, there was definitely some pork,
3054720	3056880	some graft in our budget this year.
3056880	3060000	So yeah, we got some nice new cars.
3060000	3063240	You don't need to borrow a car from me.
3063240	3065040	No, we got a cool DEA car.
3065040	3069320	Yeah, it's got a mounted machine gun on top.
3069320	3070480	It can fly.
3070480	3074480	Mostly just the car phone, but it shoots lasers.
3075440	3080440	Well, I had requisitioned a 1992 white Ford Bronco
3080920	3082000	if you're interested.
3083440	3085440	Wow, I bet that baby could really move.
3087200	3088720	Maybe we can take both.
3088720	3090640	Yeah, let's take both.
3090640	3093400	Maybe one could chase the other on the highway and see.
3094480	3097360	We go there in the DEA car,
3097360	3100600	but we leave the scene in the Bronco.
3101960	3103240	Somebody has got a draft.
3104560	3106680	The DEA car can drive itself.
3106680	3109920	Right, it's got the car phone
3109920	3112360	and also it's kit from that driver.
3117040	3118160	So what do you want to do?
3118160	3122680	So Cindy Woodabaga is still just like pinching cheeks,
3122680	3126040	rubbing face of this Billy Ray Spivey.
3126040	3129080	And after she gets all the pertinent information
3129080	3131940	that she thinks she's attained from him,
3131940	3136180	her face quickly changes back to the hardened face
3136180	3137020	you saw before.
3137020	3141220	And she gets real close in his ear and she just whispers,
3141220	3143380	your grandpappy was a.
3148500	3149340	What the hell?
3149340	3150860	And she just looks into his eyes.
3150860	3155180	She's trying to get like any pull on his mental state.
3155180	3156420	I'd like to look into Zach's eyes
3156420	3157980	and get a pull on his mental state.
3157980	3158820	Yeah.
3164500	3165940	Much like me,
3165940	3167940	Billy Ray just looks really confused right now.
3167940	3168780	Yeah, that adds up.
3168780	3171940	Basically I took the thing in Delta Green Creation
3171940	3173860	where you have to take a disorder
3173860	3178140	and hers is that she is just like drawn
3178140	3180940	to making people as uncomfortable as possible.
3180940	3182860	Good disorder, very on brand.
3184900	3186740	Do you guys think that I've done it so far?
3186740	3187560	Yes.
3188040	3188880	Okay, cool.
3191520	3193640	I have a crippling gambling addiction.
3193640	3194480	Nice.
3195480	3198620	My character likes gambling, but it's not an addiction.
3198620	3200640	I just do it all the time and I like it a lot.
3200640	3202980	Yeah, mine's a problem because I lose.
3207120	3209800	Well, I think I'm gonna give Jane a call,
3209800	3211640	see what, or maybe we should just,
3211640	3213520	does she live in in Grover's Ville?
3213520	3216360	Maybe we can go just go there and talk to her.
3216360	3220280	I agree that we should probably make way for Grover's Ville.
3221280	3223200	Make way for Grover's Ville.
3224240	3225340	Toot, toot.
3225340	3227000	You're taking the DEA car
3227000	3228720	and you're taking the White Ford Bronco?
3228720	3230080	Right, we'll hop in the Bronco
3230080	3232640	and then the DEA car will meet us there.
3232640	3233480	Driving stuff.
3238000	3238840	Very well.
3238840	3239660	Let's just keep pushing this bit
3239660	3242080	until it's a mechanic you can't take away from us.
3242760	3247760	We send the DEA car ahead of us in all scenes.
3250960	3253920	Also, the DEA car is a brilliant detective.
3256880	3259280	I did an adjusted scenario for five PCs,
3259280	3262200	so I'm gonna have to make some tweaks, but.
3264040	3267180	Yeah, I'll drive the Bronco down and follow the DEA.
3267180	3268640	I'll ride with him.
3268640	3269880	You might ride or drive.
3270280	3273520	Well, on a scale of one to 100,
3273520	3274800	how well do you think you drive?
3274800	3278360	Oh, not any better than anyone normal.
3278360	3279820	Oh, like about a 50?
3279820	3281440	Oh, not even there probably.
3281440	3284280	I don't know, what's standard these days?
3284280	3286040	Well, the way it seems to me,
3286040	3288040	a lot of these crazy drivers out here
3288040	3290440	operate in no more than 20%.
3290440	3294200	You know, if they didn't specifically
3294200	3296440	read their driver's manual, so.
3296440	3298420	Jodine, for seven or eight months now,
3298460	3301500	I've been saying, you are my ride or drive.
3301500	3303020	So I'm gonna ride you drive.
3303020	3305320	You wanna rock, paper, scissors to see who drives
3305320	3308140	or do I like driving?
3308140	3309500	If you wanna drive, that's fine.
3309500	3311780	I've just got the basic training.
3311780	3314180	Oh yeah, I've been told I'm slightly above average
3314180	3318020	at driving, only a few tickets here and there.
3318020	3319980	I'll, I guess, shotgun.
3319980	3320820	Okay.
3322060	3323260	Looks around at no one.
3324460	3326540	It's also worth reflecting upon the point
3326540	3329460	that if base drive is 20, just statistically,
3329460	3331580	you're gonna have a lot of fails and a lot of fumbles
3331580	3334020	on a regular basis, so yeah.
3334020	3336820	It does explain a lot of things in real life.
3336820	3339900	When I get in the Bronco, I check in the glove compartment
3339900	3342820	for some driving gloves and I try to put them on,
3342820	3343660	but they don't fit.
3343660	3346740	Instead, you'll find a super advanced car computer.
3346740	3349100	Oh my, no, he's in the Bronco.
3349100	3349940	I know.
3350100	3350940	I know.
3354340	3358820	The car stereo in the Bronco, it's got pretty good lows,
3358820	3361260	but how are the highs, man?
3361260	3362580	How are the highs, man?
3364180	3365740	How are the?
3365740	3367220	Yeah, I get it.
3367220	3370540	Are there any orange juice boxes in this Bronco?
3370540	3373140	I wish I could get an orange juice box.
3373140	3375260	I'd love to run away from the scene of the crime
3375260	3377820	after brutally murdering my wife and this baby.
3377820	3381380	Or in thaw of us need to calm down so we can keep going.
3381380	3383660	That was so much better than your highs, man.
3387660	3388940	I don't get any of this.
3391540	3392900	I believe that to be true.
3394660	3395660	I made the glove gym.
3395660	3398180	Have you not seen The Simpsons?
3398180	3399020	No, never have.
3399020	3399860	I'm pretty sure that's what it is.
3399860	3401580	I was born in 93.
3401580	3404180	No, Zach and Luke are both 17,
3404180	3407040	so they don't realize things like smartphones
3407120	3409240	when they weren't around back then.
3409240	3410080	Yeah, right.
3411920	3414080	You mean they talk to people without video
3414080	3415840	at the same time?
3415840	3417520	It's like young children today that are like,
3417520	3418960	why are you putting the phone up to your ear?
3418960	3420040	That doesn't make any sense.
3420040	3421280	Why would someone do that?
3421280	3422120	Are you stupid?
3422120	3423360	You're going to block the camera.
3423360	3424280	I don't want to look at you
3424280	3426360	when I'm talking to you on the phone.
3428960	3431760	If I'm calling, it's because I have a series of questions
3431760	3433120	that need to be asked rapidly
3433120	3436320	and it would take 15 fucking minutes in text.
3436320	3438520	And you only video call when you need to finish.
3438520	3439360	Exactly.
3440960	3442040	So five hours away.
3442040	3443840	If I need to see your face, you'll do.
3445840	3447120	So like five hours away,
3447120	3450240	this is the conversation we're having the whole way there.
3450240	3452020	We're in separate cars.
3452020	3453520	It's five hours away.
3453520	3456760	So Memphis is Southwest in the state.
3456760	3458560	You're basically driving up through Nashville,
3458560	3462640	going to kind of the East side of central Tennessee.
3462640	3466320	Groversville is the county seat of Grover County, Tennessee.
3466320	3469560	It's largely rural, a little bit of agriculture,
3469560	3473120	not a heck of a lot because there's only a 1200 person town.
3473120	3474520	However, there's a lot more here
3474520	3477800	than there would be otherwise because it is the county seat.
3477800	3479680	Dealing with assessments, taxes,
3479680	3481860	the county courthouses here,
3481860	3483600	but really at the center of town,
3483600	3486040	it's an intersection of two streets,
3486040	3488200	one single blinking red light in the middle.
3488200	3490440	That is the only traffic light even in town.
3490440	3493240	There's not even a standard red, yellow, and green light.
3493240	3494760	This town is so small.
3494760	3496680	So like I said, town hall at the center,
3496680	3500040	kind of nearby, you have a small combo sheriff station,
3500040	3503760	part-time ambulance and largely volunteer fire department,
3503760	3505920	a town library, a post office,
3505920	3509000	an auto and body shop, and a pair of local banks.
3509000	3511280	A little further out, more standard stuff.
3511280	3513680	Grocery store, hardware store, pharmacy,
3513680	3516800	a family video, pair of churches,
3516800	3520920	24 hour diner and ice cream shop called the Mega Deuce.
3520920	3522760	And then further out in town,
3522760	3526960	you have a pair of unbranded gas stations, a bowling alley,
3526960	3529240	a Dollar General, an auto zone,
3529240	3531620	a bar called Murrells County Bunker,
3531620	3534160	and then the place where you'll be staying,
3534160	3537320	Murrell's Shut Eye, a 12 room motel.
3537320	3538680	And someday if they're lucky,
3538680	3540160	they'll actually get fast food
3540160	3542760	or a real restaurant in this town.
3542760	3544880	That's Groversville in a nutshell.
3544880	3546700	What was the ice cream shop there?
3547520	3548360	The Mega Deuce.
3548360	3549740	The Mega Deuce.
3549740	3552500	I'm lactose intolerant, so that adds up perfectly.
3553660	3554720	That's their slogan.
3556060	3558180	One Mega Deuce, one Mega Deuce,
3558180	3559940	and you'll be making a Mega Deuce.
3561700	3563020	That's just good marketing.
3564460	3565940	You trying to take a shit?
3568820	3570860	Come on down to the shit hole.
3570860	3573100	You know in town,
3573100	3576560	you're given the name of the sheriff before you left,
3577280	3581680	his name is Dan Oakley, as in the sunglasses.
3581680	3584640	You called ahead and you had booked rooms in advance
3584640	3588000	at Murrell's Shut Eye, the motel, whenever you needed.
3588000	3589680	Getting late though on the first day,
3589680	3593480	this is probably about seven o'clock,
3593480	3595400	first night getting into town.
3595400	3596240	Where do you wanna go?
3596240	3598520	Do we know where Jane lives?
3598520	3602260	You do have her address, you can go check it out for sure.
3602260	3604360	I'm so deeply sorry, I'm about to piss my pants,
3604360	3606000	I've been holding it for like 30 minutes.
3606640	3608360	Back in like literally 20 seconds.
3608360	3609360	Dude, just piss your pants.
3609360	3610200	Yeah.
3610200	3612040	Yeah, it's better radio though.
3613880	3615120	Can we just keep talking?
3616260	3617760	You're gonna cut all this or?
3618760	3620000	Okay, I'm done.
3620000	3621520	Oh, he did it.
3621520	3623240	Oh, that's a lot.
3623240	3624600	Why is it so sticky?
3624600	3627000	I say we get all in the same car.
3627000	3628560	I was gonna say we could call her,
3628560	3632320	but I don't, I think maybe if we just drop in,
3632320	3633600	she's probably not doing anything,
3633600	3635360	there's not much to do around here.
3635560	3637920	There was the possibility that she was missing,
3637920	3641060	abducted by the burning operating laser lights
3641060	3645080	that inflict you with super strength, but endless pain.
3645080	3647320	Well, hopefully that's not the case.
3647320	3649080	I hope so too, Tan.
3649080	3650600	Vroom, vroom, vroom.
3651880	3654720	So do we leave the, we should leave the Bronco
3654720	3656320	maybe at the motel?
3656320	3657160	Merle's Shudai.
3657160	3657980	Merle's Shudai.
3657980	3660320	I'll hop in the DEA car if we wanna take one.
3660320	3662680	What kind of car is the DEA car?
3662720	3665400	It's a nice early 90s sedan.
3665400	3666440	Yep, I got it.
3666440	3667640	Hold on, I got the image.
3667640	3668720	Is it a Lincoln town car?
3668720	3671920	It is a 1992 Crown Victoria LX.
3671920	3673360	Nice. Nice.
3673360	3674280	She's gorgeous.
3674280	3675640	Beautiful car. Gorgeous.
3675640	3676480	Burgundy.
3676480	3680300	Burgundy 1992 generation one Crown Vic,
3680300	3684160	and then your 1992 Ford Bronco XLT.
3684160	3685000	Very lovely.
3685000	3686040	Yeah, those are your two cars.
3686040	3688080	All right, you're gonna take the Crown Vic.
3688080	3691760	You're gonna go to the Allen household.
3691760	3693920	Jane Allen's house.
3693920	3694740	You're not calling.
3694740	3695580	You're driving there, correct?
3695580	3697280	Just going, showing up.
3697280	3698120	Cool.
3698120	3700800	Do we want to run by the sheriffs first?
3700800	3702060	That's probably not a bad idea
3702060	3704040	just to be in good graces with the locals.
3704040	3706000	Be in good graces and also just-
3706000	3708280	But should we even announce that we're here?
3708280	3709100	Yeah.
3709100	3711000	I mean, there's definitely an advantage
3711000	3712200	to the element of surprise.
3712200	3715080	I don't know if it's on this high school girl.
3715080	3718160	She seems like probably just another victim at this point,
3718160	3719480	unless she's abducting people,
3719480	3721380	taking them out to the woods,
3721380	3724520	operating on them with supernatural light surgery
3724520	3726440	and releasing them as pain monsters.
3726440	3729120	Well, I think we have our primary suspect,
3729120	3730640	so let's go find her and kill her.
3730640	3733240	Yeah, actually, the more I'm talking about this,
3733240	3734560	the more I'm talking to myself into it.
3734560	3736160	We should bust that door down.
3737280	3738880	I mean, we could do it in character or out of character,
3738880	3741820	but I think Harlan's point to visiting Jane
3741820	3744680	was because he went missing when he was going to her house.
3744680	3746120	So if she knew anything about
3746120	3747400	what he had been doing that day,
3747400	3748920	but also I kind of wanted to know
3748920	3750300	where the kids hang out in town.
3750300	3751140	Yeah, totally.
3751140	3754380	But maybe it's a mispronunciation of her last name,
3754380	3755220	Jane Alien.
3755220	3756040	Ooh.
3756040	3756880	It's right there.
3758200	3759040	It's up to you guys.
3759040	3760440	Do you want to do Sheriff first or Jane first?
3760440	3761520	Well, let's go talk to Jane
3761520	3763560	and then we can swing by the Sheriff's office.
3763560	3765660	Yeah, we can tell him it was on our way into town.
3765660	3768240	Jane probably also is closest to this case
3768240	3769080	and you're right.
3769080	3771640	If we need to hide any of the, you know,
3771640	3773680	it's not called Delta Green yet, right?
3773680	3774520	Or it is?
3774520	3775340	It is.
3775340	3777380	But it's a little more underground
3777380	3779260	and cell-based and whatnot.
3779260	3782780	Presumably you all are from a particular cell,
3782780	3783600	the two of you?
3783600	3786620	Yeah, you told us which cell that would probably be,
3786620	3787780	lore-wise.
3787780	3789980	Does somebody else want to say it out loud first?
3789980	3792420	Oh yeah, well, I'm Agent Nan, obviously.
3792420	3794260	Cindy Woodabaga is Agent Nan.
3794260	3797140	Yeah, and I'm her partner, Agent Nephew.
3797140	3798140	Right, yeah.
3798140	3799460	So we're in Ncell.
3799460	3802840	Yeah, Ncell, which isn't a funny word in the early 90s.
3802840	3803680	Not yet.
3804680	3805760	It's not a funny word now.
3805760	3810040	It's a dangerous, poor, random hole.
3810040	3810880	Yeah.
3813800	3817000	May as well, like, come up on Delta Green's, like,
3817000	3818920	keywords to, like, look into.
3818920	3820080	Yeah.
3820080	3821280	Or they just skip that one.
3821280	3822640	There's only 25 cells.
3824980	3829040	It's like skipping the 13th floor on elevators and stuff.
3829040	3832240	L-M-O, we got them all.
3832280	3833880	Yeah, could we be T cell for Tennessee
3833880	3836060	instead of N cell for Nashville?
3838160	3841120	All right, so you drive to Jane Allen's house
3841120	3842080	outside of town.
3842080	3844560	It's a slightly nicer house than many of the others,
3844560	3847320	about a mile outside of town.
3847320	3848260	Again, it's a small town,
3848260	3850280	so that only takes a couple of minutes.
3850280	3853040	You roll up to a nicer two-story house,
3853040	3856080	well-manicured lawn, couple cars in the driveway.
3856080	3859200	Definitely looks a lot nicer than a lot of the other houses
3859200	3860760	that you've driven by on the way out here.
3860760	3863240	Nice enough to have a secret alien laboratory
3863240	3864080	underneath it?
3865120	3865960	Quite possibly.
3865960	3867520	Mm.
3867520	3868360	What do you do?
3872440	3873280	Good knock.
3873280	3874480	You tap on your microphone loudly.
3876200	3878520	You just take, okay, so now say what you want to say?
3879520	3880360	Ding dong.
3882360	3883400	You are an enigma, Agent Dan.
3883400	3886240	Ah, yes, let's go knock on the door or ring the doorbell.
3887080	3890920	Why not both?
3890920	3893080	Yeah, I'd knock on the door and ring the doorbell.
3893080	3894420	Okay, several times.
3894420	3899420	A woman comes to the door, an older, middle-aged woman.
3899640	3903560	Oh, why hello there, who are you?
3903560	3907000	We're with a federal agency looking into the disappearance
3907000	3909800	of Billy Ray Spivey and I believe your daughter,
3909800	3912240	Jane Allen, might have been involved
3912240	3913480	and we would like to speak to her.
3913480	3914680	Can she come out and play?
3914680	3916800	No, play.
3916800	3917640	I'm sorry, I-
3917640	3919600	No, she can't.
3919600	3920920	She's not here.
3920920	3921760	Where is she?
3921760	3925320	Well, she's gone, she hasn't been around for a bit.
3925320	3926840	When was the last time you saw her?
3926840	3930680	Ah, dear, about three weeks ago.
3930680	3931960	What is your name, ma'am?
3931960	3933200	My name's Nancy.
3933200	3934240	Nancy Allen.
3935240	3938080	Like the author from Springfield, Missouri.
3939720	3942880	Yes, no, yeah, she's gone, you know.
3942920	3944800	You've reported this to the sheriff, of course.
3944800	3947400	Well, why would I need, she's fine.
3947400	3949520	But you don't know where she is?
3949520	3952440	No, she's come back.
3952440	3953880	Does this happen often?
3953880	3955200	She's done this before?
3955200	3959040	No, no, my husband, he's always at work.
3959040	3960560	He's, you know, it's just me here.
3960560	3962400	I'm just taking care of, I'm just waiting.
3962400	3964520	And this doesn't seem odd to you
3964520	3966280	that she would disappear.
3966280	3968320	It's not usual for her to do that
3968320	3971940	and you're relatively unconcerned about it?
3971940	3974940	You can roll human, anyone that wants to.
3974940	3975940	I'll do that also.
3978060	3978900	89.
3978900	3979720	Fail. Fail.
3979720	3980560	Fuck, I fail also.
3980560	3981820	Hold on. So I get on a 60.
3984180	3985300	39 on a 60.
3985300	3986460	Oh, nice.
3986460	3990380	Well, Joe Dean, she seems to be telling the truth
3990380	3993460	and is pretty forthcoming and honest
3993460	3995660	and doesn't actually seem to be that concerned at all.
3995660	3997500	The rest of you can't get a good read.
3997500	3999420	Has this ever happened before?
3999420	4001340	Has she disappeared for any amount of time?
4001580	4002860	No, not really.
4002860	4004780	She's an independent girl. It's fine.
4004780	4008740	Was she like on her way to a certain place
4008740	4011580	or did she say she was going somewhere?
4011580	4014540	Any clue of what might've happened?
4014540	4016100	It just, you know, it happens sometimes.
4016100	4018780	People just, they go places and they come back.
4018780	4019620	It's fine.
4019620	4023260	Have you heard any of her friends going missing too?
4026200	4027700	Does she live here?
4027700	4029220	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4029220	4033540	Has she gone missing for upwards of three weeks before?
4033540	4034380	She said no.
4035500	4036780	For the third time, no.
4036780	4038860	For the third time, no.
4038860	4039900	Nancy.
4039900	4043260	I feel like I'm repeating myself.
4043260	4045020	It's just such a weird story.
4045020	4047860	Like, I feel like I'm getting something wrong here.
4047860	4049100	Why don't you care?
4049100	4052580	Yeah, I feel like you should carry more information
4052580	4053900	about your daughter.
4054820	4057300	I'm just very easy going.
4057300	4058140	That's all.
4058460	4059580	I'm a cool mom.
4059580	4060420	Oh yeah.
4060420	4061740	I'm a very cool mom.
4061740	4062580	I had a cool mom.
4062580	4063420	So cool.
4064700	4067100	Yeah, I had to really pull myself through.
4067100	4069180	Well, you know, like I had to get myself to high school
4069180	4071300	and then pay for my own college and everything.
4071300	4074620	Cool mom isn't always so cool at the end of the day.
4074620	4076500	You know what I mean?
4076500	4077820	Just something to think on.
4077820	4078860	I don't.
4078860	4080620	I've always wanted to be the cool mom.
4080620	4083620	Is that some sort of thing they do in like the Northeast?
4083620	4086100	Are you from up in Pennsylvania maybe
4086100	4088580	and you were trying out like the parenting technique,
4088580	4091820	some sort of Philadelphia experiment or something?
4091820	4094500	Oh no, we got wine moms all over the country.
4094500	4096260	No, I'm born and bred.
4096260	4097700	Born and bred in Grover'sville.
4097700	4100060	You were born inbred?
4100060	4100900	Expand on that.
4100900	4102020	Yes.
4102020	4103740	That was not a slip-up.
4103740	4105940	I don't think you actually said born inbred.
4107300	4109100	Oh, you're gonna have to rewind that.
4109100	4109940	Inbred.
4109940	4110780	Rewind that and listen again.
4110780	4112620	Ah.
4112620	4114940	For those of you playing along at home.
4116100	4120580	Is Mr. Allen home?
4120580	4122700	Is there a Mr. Allen here?
4122700	4124340	No, he's just at work.
4124340	4125180	Where does he work?
4125180	4126020	Town hall.
4126020	4127660	He's one of the aldermen running the town.
4127660	4128540	Just so busy.
4128540	4129500	Work, work, work.
4129500	4130580	What is his name?
4130580	4131460	Work, work, work.
4131460	4132300	Allen.
4132300	4133120	Allen.
4133120	4133960	Allen.
4133960	4135980	His last name is in fact Allen.
4135980	4137540	It's Bradley Allen.
4137540	4139620	Maybe we ought to go talk to him.
4139620	4141620	Maybe he cares.
4141620	4144220	Have you seen him recently or has he been gone
4144260	4146140	for an extended period of time at this point?
4146140	4147180	He's been working.
4147180	4148020	For how long?
4148020	4149020	He's been working real hard.
4149020	4149860	Good.
4152120	4152960	I don't know.
4152960	4153780	Years.
4154980	4156320	Yeah.
4156320	4158860	Do you mind if we come in and look around?
4158860	4159900	Yeah, sure.
4159900	4161860	Yeah, you seem pretty chill.
4161860	4163460	All right, let's go ahead.
4163460	4164900	Can you show us to Jane's room?
4164900	4165720	Sure.
4165720	4167180	Maybe she has like some letters
4167180	4168860	that she's written from her.
4168860	4169680	Sure.
4169680	4172980	She is going to walk you all upstairs.
4172980	4175780	Harlan wants to be clocking pictures as we go.
4175780	4178540	Can I get a sense of which one Jane looks like?
4179980	4184980	Jane is a late teenage year girl,
4184980	4189100	minor amount of acne, very pale.
4189100	4190140	One of those people with almost like
4190140	4192300	uniformly colored skin tone,
4192300	4196980	just like kind of this off-white eggshellish almost color.
4196980	4198800	Oddly, in all the photos,
4198800	4201540	she has almost identically the same smile.
4201540	4203580	She's one of those people that whenever they smile,
4203580	4207700	it's exact same look every single photo.
4207700	4211500	I have the exact same photo in all of my pictures.
4211500	4212860	I look like Zach.
4214060	4215600	Fucking woof, dude.
4218580	4219840	Zach, Zach same.
4220780	4221620	I liked it.
4221620	4222440	Every time.
4223880	4224720	It was good.
4224720	4225620	It was good.
4225620	4228720	So Cindy sees a picture where Nancy Allen
4228720	4231940	is looking particularly good in a family photo.
4231940	4232780	And she's like,
4232780	4235160	wow, you're dressed to kill in this one.
4236040	4236880	Thank you.
4236880	4238000	It means a lot.
4238000	4240160	Once we get to her room, I...
4240160	4241320	Sometimes it works.
4245600	4246440	Ever done it?
4248240	4251040	You're really dressed to kill.
4251040	4252880	It's funny you say that because I killed someone.
4252880	4255880	I killed my daughter in this dress, yeah.
4255880	4258700	Hairs all blown out, yeah.
4259620	4260460	Is anything missing from her room?
4260460	4263500	Any clothes or nothing?
4263500	4265340	Yeah, let's do a quick search.
4265340	4266420	One more question about her.
4266420	4269420	Does she look like she's been taking care of herself?
4269420	4271920	Or has she been wearing these clothes for like three weeks?
4271920	4273180	I take care of herself.
4273180	4277100	Houses in pristine condition, cleaned, smells fresh.
4277100	4280660	Jane Allen's room, bed made, window open.
4280660	4283020	It's not sunny anymore cause it's later in the day,
4283020	4286680	but it looks like a freshly cleaned kids room.
4286680	4288720	Do you think she might've went out the window?
4288720	4291480	That was my first thought.
4291480	4292320	Exactly.
4292320	4294480	I think she might've said goodbye to her mother
4294480	4295600	and then just left.
4295600	4297240	But did she leave out the window?
4299000	4300320	You want to give me those search roles?
4300320	4301160	Yeah.
4302120	4304160	I got a 33.
4304160	4307000	Oh, I also succeed.
4307000	4308360	I succeed also.
4308360	4310200	Critical success.
4310200	4314720	With your successes, you see a largely standard kids room.
4314720	4316240	There's nothing really out of place
4316760	4318920	as far as clothes or anything else goes.
4318920	4320360	Her desk is there.
4320360	4321200	It's September.
4321200	4322680	She just started her senior year of high school.
4322680	4325960	So you see kind of her freshly purchased books
4325960	4328080	and other material, but she's been gone for three weeks
4328080	4330460	basically since like the start of the semester.
4330460	4332260	But with that critical success,
4332260	4336160	you find a business card on that desk on top of the books.
4336160	4339760	And that business card says Scott Adams,
4339760	4343200	watch the skies, exclamation point.
4343200	4345100	And it has an email address.
4345100	4350100	And the email address is watchtheskies at aol.com.
4350460	4351980	What the hell does this mean?
4351980	4355060	["I Can't Get High"]
4381980	4385060	["I Can't Get High"]
4411980	4415060	["I Can't Get High"]
4441980	4445060	["I Can't Get High"]
4471980	4474980	["I Can't Get High"]
4501980	4504980	["I Can't Get High"]
4531980	4534980	["I Can't Get High"]
4561980	4564980	["I Can't Get High"]
