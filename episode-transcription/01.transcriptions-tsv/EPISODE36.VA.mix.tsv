0	5000	Hello, my babies, and hello to my babies' babies.
5680	8680	Heck, even hello to those babies' babies.
8680	11080	Let's just get wild, y'all.
11080	13760	It's your local radio DJ
13760	18580	that you actually wanna listen to, Wolf the Dog.
18580	22400	This week, I have a message here from my producer.
22400	26160	It says, Zach and Taylor are on vacation.
26160	28480	He's real torn up about it,
28520	31000	but there just wasn't enough free time this week
31000	33700	to release an episode that is up to snuff.
33700	36500	For this, he feels shame, regret,
36500	39320	and just a tinge of arousal.
39320	41300	He wants each and every one of you
41300	43300	to know how special you are,
43300	46040	but quality time with the incomparable,
46040	49600	and formidable love of his life is paramount.
49600	52960	Thank you deeply for understanding.
52960	56320	You know, back in the day, old Wolfie Boy
56320	58760	used to have a little old Wolfie partner
58760	61040	that he would have missed the show for.
61040	63840	I still dream of her sometimes,
63840	66880	wondering what she's up to back in contention.
66880	70160	How many dumpsters has she dove in without me?
70160	73220	What if they're with some other new dog that ain't wolf?
73220	75920	So go on, Zach, whoever the hell that is.
75920	77440	Enjoy your life.
77440	81580	Eat all the trash you can, baby.
81580	84800	Next week is going to be a wild ride, y'all,
84800	86760	but for now, hold on tight
86760	89640	and keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle.
89640	92320	Playing us in and immediately out
92320	96240	is Kudzu with No Backbone.
96240	112240	["How Am I the Only One Trying to Pull Over?" by Kudzu playing in the background.]
112240	119960	How am I the only one trying to pull over?
119960	130760	How can you have enough drowning out all the noise?
130760	142960	There's nobody home, no one home, no one home.
142960	149960	Fight to fight, street me down, takes me back to where you're from.
149960	160960	When you don't stop a dying love, don't push on to only one.
161960	180960	There's nobody home, no one home, no one home, no one home.
180960	206960	["How Am I the Only One Trying to Pull Over?" by Kudzu playing in the background.]
207240	210960	Tell me it hurts.
210960	214960	Tell me it hurts.
214960	218460	Tell me it hurts.
218460	222960	Tell me it hurts.
222960	227560	Tell me it hurts.
227560	229960	Tell me it hurts.
229960	233940	Tell me it hurts.
233940	236940	Tell me it hurts.
237920	242420	Tell me it hurts.
242420	245920	Tell me it hurts.
245920	249920	Tell me it hurts.
249920	254920	Tell me it hurts.
266940	271940	Tell me it hurts.
