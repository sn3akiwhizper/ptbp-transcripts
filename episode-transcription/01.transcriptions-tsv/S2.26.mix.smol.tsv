0	6000	Good evening to all of those who join me in this dimension we call home.
6000	13700	It is I, Wolf the Dog, DJ Extraordinaire and also Enjoyer of Slop.
13700	18900	And I'm here to sling some sound directly to your ear canals.
18900	24600	The radio station is called 694.2 PTBP.
24600	29400	The time is now and forever ago simultaneously.
29400	34300	And the best part of the show has arrived and it is starting.
34300	40800	Now, this here howlin' with Wolf is from Ben Feliciano in Denver, Colorado.
40800	45000	Who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.
45000	47700	A thing you can do too if you wanna rule.
47700	50600	Like, rule, not rule.
50600	53700	You know, Ben Feliciano rules.
53700	55100	And he writes,
55100	57500	Hey Pretendy Friendies.
57500	61400	I'd like to howl at my bandmates in Younger than Neil.
61400	70100	Listening to and talking about RPG podcasts is one of the many ways we pass the time at rehearsal or in the tour van.
70100	74000	Besides trying to guess who farted by scent alone.
74000	79500	We're no kudzu with no backbone but we do like making ska punk.
79500	84500	A genre more dead than half the townspeople of the first season.
84500	86600	And PTBP.
86600	88800	If it's not too much to ask.
88800	93100	On May 5th through the 27th of 2023.
93100	102300	I'd love to meet any fellow Denver fans at the opening of my first solo art exhibit at Memento Mori Art Gallery.
102300	106700	I'll be there on opening night and periodically throughout the month.
106700	111600	Visit BenFeliciano.art for more details.
111600	116500	Woof the dog.
116500	120500	Praying for you but more importantly to you.
120500	122400	Do you hear me, wolf?
122400	125100	Do you smell the blood on your altar?
125100	128100	P.S. Should I try different candles?
128100	130900	Maybe you're not a fan of lavendar.
130900	133800	Thank you dearest Ben.
133800	135600	And I do hear you.
135600	137400	I do smell you.
137400	140700	And I do see you at all times.
140700	143600	You're my favorite Ben so far.
143600	147600	Even if you use the worst scented candle of all time.
147600	152100	You make music, you make art, and you love little old me.
152100	155100	And what's not to love about all of that?
155100	156400	Remember y'all.
156400	162100	Go to old Ben's art show if you can and tell everyone there that wolf sent you.
162100	165400	If you want to write up something for your wolf to how.
165400	168100	Tag at PretendingPod on the internet.
168100	169400	Fuck Al Gore.
169400	175400	Or write up a five star review on the podcast app of your choice and make me aware of it.
175400	177300	Oh, hey, you.
177300	178600	Yeah, you.
178600	181000	You seem cool.
181000	184100	So I'll let you in on a little secret.
184100	191200	You can help support this show and make sure it keeps happening by exchanging five US dollars
191200	197500	for shitloads of bonus content over at Patreon.com slash PretendingPod.
197500	200100	There's other cool shit on the internet, too.
200100	204500	And for a fair amount of it, the links are in the show notes.
204500	211000	Lose your muse and choose to refuse an excuse to those whose blues cruise through the...
211000	211900	What's that?
211900	213200	No news?
213200	214700	Are you for real?
214700	215400	Ugh.
215400	222800	My producer is telling me the boys, almost all of whom are in their early thirties now,
222800	226000	except Luke who is seventeen years old.
226000	232200	I guess these dude kids do a fine job of reminding themselves where they were before
232200	234600	things really get going.
234600	236500	Welcome back, y'all.
236500	239800	And get ready for the world to unfurl.
239800	246500	It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and it's All My Fall.
246500	255500	My life is great and it's all my fault.
255500	266000	Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.
266000	273500	Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.
273500	286600	I always get the, those like panda cookie things, you know what I'm talking about?
286600	290600	They're like, I don't know, regular kind of cookie on the outside and then filled with
290600	294100	panda with like chocolate and they're shaped like pandas.
294100	295100	Whoa.
295100	296100	That sounds good.
296100	297600	They're super good, but they're always out of them.
297600	302300	And so now I learned, if you ask, the lady will go in the back for you.
302300	304400	What kind of cookie is the outer cookie?
304400	306100	I will load it up and show you.
306100	308700	That works in a lot of stores if they have it.
308700	314000	Yeah, but I like never thought to do it cause I like, I would always like peek in the back
314000	315000	to see what was back there.
315000	321500	And it's just like people that like look at you, like don't look back here.
321500	322500	Like okay, I won't.
322500	326600	I also picked up a sea salt flavored soda and it was really good.
326600	327600	I know.
327600	329600	They're called Hello Panda.
330600	332600	Wait, I guess soda water.
332600	337800	It's like, yeah, just like, I don't like cracker cookie kind of thing on the outside.
337800	338800	Okay.
338800	339800	Yeah.
339800	340800	Yeah.
340800	341800	It's not what you think.
341800	344800	It's not salty flavored, but it's like sea salt because it's like sea salt ice cream.
344800	346600	So it's kind of a creamy soda.
346600	347840	It was really good.
347840	348840	Is it a little salty?
348840	349840	I'm sorry.
349840	352000	Is it like sea salt ice cream or is it called sea salt ice cream?
352000	353860	No, it's called sea salt soda.
353860	354860	Is it a little?
354860	357000	So it's like a cream soda with a little salt.
357000	358000	Yeah.
358400	360600	There wasn't a whole lot of saltiness to it, if any.
360600	364400	Like I think it was just what the flavor profile was closest to.
364400	366680	You thought disappointed Thomas and I are?
366680	367680	I was too.
367680	368680	Except that it was really good.
368680	369680	Yeah.
369680	370680	Yeah.
370680	371680	We're like, Joe, why didn't it suck?
371680	372680	Hey Joe, what's your problem?
372680	376680	Why aren't you talking shit on the thing you liked?
376680	380680	I always get the mango milk tea things.
380680	381680	Ooh.
381680	382680	That sounds good.
382680	383680	Yeah.
383680	386680	Whereas sea salt soda is almost inherently misleading.
386680	387680	Yeah.
388360	389360	Yeah.
389360	390360	It sounds like a fucking prank.
390360	391360	It's not your fault, Joe.
391360	392360	Yeah, it does.
392360	398160	Welcome to episode 26 of season two of pretending to be people.
398160	402580	We are back at it after a fair amount of time away.
402580	404480	We were off in holy cow farmland.
404480	405480	That's right.
405480	406480	Yeah.
406480	407480	It's shit.
407480	408480	And for like four episodes.
408480	411480	And before that we left you on a proverbial cliff.
411480	412480	What?
412480	413480	What?
413480	414480	Who's that?
414480	415480	Who's here?
415480	416480	Who is it?
416480	417480	Who is here?
417480	418480	Who is she?
418480	419480	I don't even know.
419480	420480	Say the Borat thing, Zach.
420480	421480	Oh, I think we're live streaming.
421480	422480	No.
422480	423480	Nope.
423480	424480	Nope.
424480	425480	Nope.
425480	426480	Nope.
426480	427480	Just recording.
427480	428480	It's your friendly neighborhood Taylor.
428480	429480	Tell us a joke or a fact.
429480	430480	Oh, whoa.
430480	431480	See you, Taylor.
431480	432480	Wow.
432480	433480	What a weird fact that she said.
433480	434480	She left a dust cloud like Taylor shaped.
434480	435480	Yeah.
435480	436480	She just zoomed away.
436480	440120	And a Taylor shaped hole in the door.
440120	441120	And my heart.
441120	442840	All the way through the house.
442840	443840	Aw.
443840	444840	Oh, wait.
444840	446840	Did you get that looked at?
446840	449280	It hurts.
449280	452160	That's way, Taylor is way bigger than just your heart.
452160	454800	A lot of you has a hole through it right now.
454800	456680	I think we're about the same size.
456680	460840	I can see the plug, like the plug that shot out and hit the wall.
460840	461840	In her shape.
461840	462840	You're all crust.
462840	466640	We could try to just squish it back together like a puzzle piece.
466640	471160	That reminds me of a scene in Kung Pao Enter the Fist where he punches a guy's stomach
471160	472160	out.
472160	473160	And he's like, what?
473160	474160	And then he's like, okay, you can pass.
474480	476880	I was thinking of the scene in the first episode of The Boys.
476880	478880	Oh, yeah.
478880	479880	Shit.
479880	481720	There's not much rippable there.
481720	484680	I was just picturing just the outline of Luke.
484680	487880	Oh, that's why you said just the crust.
487880	488880	Just the crust.
488880	489880	Like a cookie cutter.
489880	490880	Yeah.
490880	493880	I missed it and I thought you were saying that I was made out of crust or something.
493880	498560	I thought it was more like it had already scabbed over and I was like, weird take.
498560	499880	Weather or earth or pizza.
499880	500880	Just the Luke crust.
500880	503440	Just the Luke crust.
503720	504720	And like dong.
504720	508120	I think that's a realistic interpretation if they like stood like Michelangelo style
508120	510960	and like he blasted Taylor through it.
510960	511960	Yeah.
511960	512960	Yep.
512960	513960	The Vitruvian.
513960	514960	Luke.
514960	515960	Man.
515960	517960	What would be a pizza?
517960	519240	Like a Vitruvian.
519240	520240	The Vitruvian.
520240	522760	Last we left off, the can crew was out of sorts.
522760	523760	Yeah.
523760	524760	Yeah.
524760	528480	Y'all done did a dang thing that people say that you're not supposed to do, but something
528480	532800	that we here at Pretending to Be People really enjoyed it.
532800	533800	We're fond of it.
533800	534800	Yeah.
534800	535800	If you split up.
535800	536800	Split the crew, baby.
536800	538440	You can solve more of the mystery.
538440	540000	That's exactly right.
540000	545240	For the Discord, spoiler chat, not for us who don't get to listen to those parts for
545240	548760	like potentially a year and a half.
548760	551200	There's still a lot of the first season that I haven't heard.
551200	552200	Same.
552200	558880	I went back through it for a lot of the Pennymore arc and respected a lot of choices more that
558880	561920	other people had made because I understood them.
561920	562920	Yeah.
562920	564240	We had some cliffhangers there.
564240	565600	Julius was off on his own.
565600	566600	I said sayonara.
566600	567600	Peace.
567600	568600	Bye bye.
568600	569600	We said deuces.
569600	570600	Goodbye.
570600	571600	Top notch.
571600	572700	Top gun.
572700	578020	I'm really happy with all the decisions that were made and what we're about to get into,
578020	579600	which we've already recorded.
579600	580600	Spoilers.
580600	584760	I was going to say, who are you starting with?
584760	586800	A little behind the scenes here.
586800	590960	I think we're going to start with Luke, which we recorded a couple of days ago.
590960	591960	It was good.
591960	595000	So we'll all not be in the room then and then.
595000	596000	Okay.
596000	599360	Well, should I leave the room for you to record them then?
599360	601760	I'll leave the room now.
601760	609120	Actually, yeah, that is what we need is a moment maybe as players together to talk about
609120	610120	this.
610120	611960	I'm not sure you guys are allowed to talk about that right now.
611960	612960	I think we got to.
612960	613960	You're the DM.
613960	614960	You can.
614960	619880	We have to reconvene.
619920	622520	You know the difference between an alligator and a crocodile?
622520	623520	No.
623520	627480	You'll see one later and you'll see the other after a while.
627480	632400	Speaking of which, we'll see you guys later while we cut to Julius.
632400	634400	After crocodile wild.
634400	640560	Alligator later.
640560	644080	Maybe they've made a box around me with their space time bending powers.
644080	647680	They have a certain eldritch hate fuck factor about that.
647680	653880	Also Mr. Mime undoubtedly, canonically fucked Ash's mom and is his father.
653880	655640	That's some big dick energy.
655640	656640	Is that real?
656640	657640	Okay.
657640	665160	Last Google is Mr. Mime Ash's dad.
665160	671420	Ever since Ash caught him in It's Mr. Mime Time, Mr. Mime AKA Mime as he's been nicknamed
671420	674080	has been living with his mother in Pallet Town.
674080	675080	Wow.
675080	676400	So he's like a stepdad.
676400	678720	It's Mr. Mime Time, huh?
678720	681280	Well, I'll be beating off to that later.
681280	683400	That was enlightening.
683400	684400	And now...
684400	685400	You ready to get into it?
685400	686400	Let's do it.
686400	687760	There have been Luke Luke.
687760	689440	Hey, I'm here with Luke.
689440	690440	I'm here.
690440	691440	I'm Luke.
691440	692440	Is Thomas here?
692440	693440	Nope.
693440	694440	Is Joe here?
694440	695440	Not a chance.
695440	696440	Is Justin here?
696440	697440	Um...
697440	698440	Oh, he is.
698440	699440	He's hiding in the closet.
699440	700440	That's right.
700440	701440	Play with your keyboard.
701440	704120	Man, let's get those tones.
704120	705120	Do what?
705840	707840	Oh, he said he's beating off to Mr. Mime.
707840	713040	Okay, yeah, just be quiet.
713040	715240	Just play the music again.
715240	718520	There have been some gaps in this story.
718520	725240	Strangely, at our table, we've always accounted for each character's time with a completionist's
725240	726240	mindset.
726240	733600	But there's a very specific gap that I think that we should address, and that is what did
733600	740400	Julius Summers get up to the night of June 18th.
740400	751280	Let's go back now to that wild night at the foundry, as a sweaty, writhing mass of interns
751280	757120	drool chant and breathe all out of their slack-jawed maws.
757120	771600	And the screen, once again, fades to black with the sound of shots, being slurped greedily
771600	776600	from the now saliva-covered, bare stomach of Julius Summers.
776600	783920	But this time, instead of cutting to the next day, let's take a look at later that night,
783920	785440	as Julius exits.
786080	789120	Well, I guess I should just ask you, Luke.
789120	790160	What's up, man?
790160	794960	How does Julius Summers exit the foundry that evening?
794960	798400	Amongst the excitement, Julius decides to dip.
799040	802480	One of the interns rips their shirt and throws it on the ground.
803040	809760	Julius grabs that and cleans his stomach up a little bit, wipes some of the liquor and
809760	812400	drool and other fluids off.
812400	819680	And you hear the interns are like, basically, it's like ramping back up as another new
819680	828320	initiate into the news conglomerates, foundry regulars here in the city, hops onto the bar
828320	831040	and takes your previous position.
831680	835440	Julius stumbles out the front door of the foundry, looks around.
836080	836800	He's alone.
837440	838480	It's late.
838480	839680	The sun's down.
839680	840880	It's not quite up yet.
841760	844720	And he just starts walking down the road.
844720	848240	He gets just out of eyesight of the foundry.
848960	853600	He stands up completely straight, looks his head over to the right, opens his mouth and
853600	854720	just vomits.
855360	861760	But not like his body is telling him to, but like he's telling his body to.
861760	862080	Yes.
862800	870480	He throws up, starts walking, not stumbling at all, completely above the influence.
871360	872400	It's a text alert.
872400	874080	He pulls his phone out and looks.
874080	880480	It's a text from a number that's like 62266 or something like that.
881200	882880	And it says, it's Bernie.
883840	884560	Yeah, exactly.
884560	885280	It's one of those.
885280	893040	It's like, looks like an automated text, but it just says Z, like a lowercase Z.
894080	900560	Julius looks at it, understands, puts his phone back in his pocket and
900640	902000	starts to jog.
902720	908960	When he gets to the main road, he pulls his phone out and calls a car.
908960	911520	Where does this car end up?
912800	917760	Well, the driverless car with the giant camera on top pulls up.
917760	918960	He gets in the back.
918960	919680	What is that?
919680	921440	It's like a self-driving car.
921440	921680	Oh.
922400	924800	You know, like the ones with the giant camera.
924800	925840	It's like a prototype.
926640	927920	They're running in the city.
927920	928960	That sounds cool.
928960	931680	He gets in that cause he doesn't want anyone to know.
931680	933040	No, of course not.
933040	938240	The car drives for a little while and eventually he sees off in the distance
939680	948160	a very tall space needle shaped tower with a flashing light at the top.
948160	948400	Yeah.
948400	958080	Not quite fully a space needle height, but a poor attempt at the monument up there in
958160	960080	Seattle here in the city.
960080	970240	And as you drive up, the car stops in the parking lot where there is shit pouring down.
971120	975120	There is a slight uneven level to this parking lot.
975680	985840	There's one other car in this lot and it is a slick, sleek, chic, clean, black, matte
986720	990960	Jaguar XE is the only other car.
991600	995040	Who the fuck mows their lawn at a reasonable time of day?
995040	998560	At 4.30 in the morning when we're recording this.
1001040	1002240	Oh, that's fun.
1002240	1003680	We've never dealt with that before.
1004240	1005280	It's weird.
1005280	1007040	Should we 30 seconds of silence just engage?
1007040	1008080	I think so, yeah.
1008960	1009440	Okay.
1009440	1009840	All right.
1011120	1012080	We'll see if that works.
1013040	1019040	It's the only other car in the lot and your driverless car has now parked.
1019040	1024400	Julius gets out of his car, looks over at the Jaguar, looks up at the zeitgeist.
1025360	1027200	I hope the elevator is broken.
1028080	1034000	And he starts heading towards the zeitgeist and he's going to run up those stairs because
1034000	1038400	he knows he's going to meet somebody at the very tippy top.
1038400	1039920	At the very tippy top.
1039920	1046080	And as you approach, we see the lovely ground all around this area.
1046080	1046640	It's lovely.
1046640	1047840	Oh, it's so lovely.
1047840	1050400	Untouched even, unbroken.
1050400	1052160	Man, there's no holes around here.
1052160	1058320	As if really no one's hung out around here, at least in a digging capacity.
1058960	1065920	And you walk into a jar door at the bottom of the zeitgeist.
1066960	1069200	Do you even check if the elevator is down?
1069200	1069760	No.
1069760	1073520	He's getting the leg workout in.
1074080	1076000	And he goes up how many flights of stairs?
1076000	1077200	What a rude question.
1078080	1079440	Okay, you kept that.
1079440	1080480	I think it was like eight.
1081920	1085440	He starts running up countless flights of stairs.
1086080	1087040	So many.
1087040	1088400	Less than 10 probably.
1088400	1091680	And once he gets, there's like one more flight of stairs.
1091680	1096160	He finally maybe starts feeling a little something in his legs,
1096160	1100000	but he's a little disappointed with such a meager workout.
1100000	1105040	I mean, are your thighs like, do you have a chafe issue with these big boys?
1105040	1110800	No, the pants that he's wearing, all his pants that he owns are specifically tailored.
1110800	1111760	Reinforced.
1111760	1112240	Right.
1112240	1115440	To not chafe his legs because he's going to be working out.
1116000	1124080	Whether it's in athletic gear or a suit, there's a high probability he'll be getting leg day in.
1124080	1127440	And you open up the door into the top of the zeitgeist,
1127440	1132720	this old and decrepit room in a large circle.
1132720	1139840	You kind of see around the rounded corner of this kind of internal bar and the windows,
1139840	1143840	some of which are no longer there around the outside.
1143840	1148880	And standing and kind of up against where there was a window once.
1149680	1155040	You see a woman familiar to you wearing a black suit, white shirt, black sunglasses.
1157040	1162640	And a tattoo runs out of her sleeve and down her hand.
1163600	1167920	It's like a scaly tail that reaches down and around.
1168880	1173840	She turns holding a package in her hand that's closest toward you.
1174480	1178320	Mr. Summers, you made it very quickly.
1178400	1184480	Yeah, I was on my way out of initiation or whatever you want to call it.
1184480	1187840	With the crew, how is that going?
1188560	1189520	Exceedingly well.
1190240	1190720	Good.
1190720	1194000	I'm learning a lot about TV stuff.
1196560	1204160	Well, as long as that TV stuff continues to carry the weight of what you texted me about earlier,
1204160	1206480	the Godel farm.
1206480	1211360	And I mean, do you think there's anything going on with this Kaylee Silver woman?
1211360	1212400	They're trying to play it off.
1212400	1217280	Like, you know, maybe she snapped or something, but there's something more to it.
1217280	1218560	We'll get something soon.
1218560	1219680	I can feel it.
1219680	1220960	It's only been a day.
1220960	1227200	I mean, I did see some farm wrestling, but other than that, nothing too crazy.
1227200	1230160	She looks at you with a wry smile and is like,
1230160	1236160	well, I just want you to remember that with the pressure that we're putting on the Godel company,
1236880	1241680	we're going to likely have to deal with some Godel-owned pigs here in the city.
1242640	1247680	And for each one that, I don't know, let's say doesn't have a job anymore,
1247680	1250160	it's going to earn you quite the promotion.
1250720	1252320	Let's race through the ranks.
1252320	1253120	She smiles.
1253680	1254560	What's in the package?
1255680	1256800	Don't worry about what's in it.
1256800	1257760	Needs to be delivered.
1258320	1260400	7251 West Shift Street.
1261680	1265600	In exchange, you'll receive a package as well.
1266880	1269120	We'll be in contact when I need to retrieve it.
1269920	1270480	Sounds good.
1271600	1273040	Do you want me to leave first or?
1273680	1275920	No, it'll take too long getting down the stairs.
1275920	1276400	Let me go.
1277840	1282480	And with that, Julia Summers bounds down the stairs,
1282480	1288640	back out of the zeitgeist through the bit of woods down to the parking lot
1289920	1292240	where the driverless car is waiting.
1292240	1297520	He goes into the app and sends the car home and he's getting a run in.
1298080	1301040	You pull up 7251 West Shift Street.
1301040	1304560	It's like, how far would you be willing to run right now?
1307120	1311440	When he pulls it up the walking direction, say two hours and 17 minutes,
1312800	1313840	45 minutes.
1313840	1314400	Yep.
1314400	1315360	A bit out of breath.
1316160	1317920	It's been a long fucking day.
1317920	1318960	It's late.
1318960	1322400	He's feeling like maybe a beer made it into him.
1326000	1330160	And you come across this old, old house.
1330160	1335440	It's seemingly like built by someone with a specific image in mind
1335440	1337760	of what they wanted their home to look like.
1337760	1341920	It's not like any of the other older homes in the area.
1341920	1343920	A lot of ranch style houses around here.
1343920	1346800	And this one is kind of a mix between that older look
1346800	1349280	with almost like a modern architecture to it.
1350080	1355840	The yard is absolutely filled with all sorts of oddities.
1357920	1363520	Massive sculptures of birds of prey and reptiles.
1365840	1368960	Other seemingly decorative objects.
1369360	1376080	All of which look extremely old and handpicked.
1377760	1381040	Julius doesn't really care.
1381040	1384960	He's there to give and get and then get out.
1385760	1386480	Where do you go?
1386480	1387280	Up to the front door.
1390480	1392320	Knock on the door, knock on the door.
1393680	1395120	Your mailman just walked up.
1397520	1398320	That's good timing.
1398960	1399520	Let's get him.
1400560	1401680	Do you want to be a guest?
1405520	1406880	That's a scary question.
1408240	1409040	Be my guest.
1411280	1415920	You can, uh, you know, put our, put our service to the test.
1415920	1417760	We can check him before we wreck him.
1421920	1423760	Julius thinks and then laughs.
1424800	1425600	David Spade.
1427120	1427840	Who is it?
1428480	1430800	I've got a package.
1430800	1437120	The door opens and you see a man with a short beard, flannel shirt,
1437120	1439120	cargo pants, rugged boots.
1439680	1443360	He's got just like stained with dirt all over his shirt,
1443360	1449280	all over his hands wearing a bit of like a gray brown cowboy hat.
1449280	1450480	Just a bit of one apparently.
1450480	1453120	He's wearing a faded gray brown cowboy hat.
1454080	1456640	And you see behind him in the entryway,
1456640	1461280	there is a shovel leaning up against the wall within view
1461280	1465760	that is glinting in the morning light shining in through the door.
1466320	1468720	He quickly takes the package from you.
1468720	1470800	Julius grabs it away.
1470800	1471840	You first.
1471840	1472960	Oh yes, of course.
1472960	1477280	My, uh, my deepest, uh, sincerest apologies.
1477280	1478640	Let me grab that for you.
1478640	1480800	And he closes the door.
1481600	1482880	You hear a bit of a rummage.
1484720	1486320	He rummages to completion.
1486880	1490960	And then he comes back to the door, opens it up
1490960	1496240	and hands you a bag, a tote bag.
1496240	1499520	Julius grabs the bag, hands over the package
1499520	1502400	and then kind of like gestures to the yard.
1502400	1506480	And it's like, so like, what's, uh, what's all that?
1506480	1508240	Oh, do you enjoy the pieces?
1509040	1510160	They're interesting.
1510160	1510720	Yes.
1510720	1510960	Yes.
1510960	1516800	I, uh, I, every single time I drive back or leave my home,
1516800	1521760	I get to look at them and be reminded of all the wonderful things.
1521760	1524560	He gets an off distance look.
1524560	1532560	He's gone in the, in the sunrise as he's off on my mini expeditions.
1532560	1537360	But Julius looks down at his watch and back up at this guy.
1537360	1539120	And he's still smiling.
1539280	1543520	He nods his head and, uh, is gonna head out.
1543520	1545840	Yes, have an excellent morning, sir.
1546800	1551120	Julius is going to walk away and, uh, he's going to look in the bag.
1552160	1553200	Oh, he looks in the bag?
1553200	1553440	Yeah.
1553440	1558160	Since if it was a package, he was going to not unwrap it, but it's in a bag.
1558160	1558960	He's going to look.
1558960	1559200	Yeah.
1559200	1560320	There's a piece of parchment.
1561520	1562480	He's going to read it.
1562480	1573120	Uh, it is this parchment that has a language on it that you've never seen before.
1573760	1577280	And do you have any skills?
1580560	1582400	I guess I need my character sheet.
1584720	1585040	Okay.
1585040	1586240	Do I have any skills?
1586240	1586640	I do.
1588160	1589200	What specifically?
1589280	1598000	I'm looking for a SIGINT or a specific language or archeology, history.
1598560	1601120	Julius has a 70 SIGINT.
1601120	1603680	Oh, oh, does he?
1603680	1604240	Interesting.
1604240	1604720	Okay.
1604720	1608480	Uh, and with this, uh, 70 SIGINT, let's roll baby.
1610720	1612400	61 on a 70.
1612400	1614800	61 on a 70.
1616400	1617520	It tells you two things.
1618240	1626880	One, this is a stone rubbing and two, you've never seen this language before, but you think
1626880	1630320	you might know someone who can help you out with it.
1632400	1634640	Julius makes a note of it.
1634640	1641280	In fact, he takes a picture of it on his phone, puts it back in the bag, kind of how it was.
1642080	1646320	And then, um, Julius is going to jog home.
1647520	1652000	He can leave it on the kitchen counter for his handler, who is his roommate.
1660320	1662000	Let's go now to July 6th.
1662000	1665200	Let's pick up exactly where we were with Julius Summers.
1665200	1672800	As you walked up through the hall, the Cannes studio, you hear Tife whistling.
1677520	1685280	You open up the door and you see your uncle Tife Raylan standing behind his desk.
1685280	1690800	And you see two other people sitting at chairs on either side, closer to you.
1690800	1693200	Both kind of turned back looking at you.
1693200	1699040	You see cops, one tall kind of spindly, one short ball jacked.
1699680	1700720	And they all look at you.
1701440	1705120	Julius fucking my baby boy.
1705120	1706160	What's up, Neff?
1706160	1707200	How's it going?
1707520	1708640	How you living?
1708640	1710400	Oh, forget about it.
1710400	1712320	Come hungry for you.
1712320	1714800	We got some stuff we need to take care of.
1714800	1715520	Where's your boys?
1715520	1716160	Where's Beck?
1716160	1716800	Where's Cal?
1717360	1719680	I'm the only one that's going to be here.
1719680	1720720	Why is that?
1720720	1724400	I thought I told you to bring the whole team down, baby.
1724400	1727600	They're not going to do what you want them to do.
1727600	1730160	And what is that that I want them to do?
1730160	1732000	Give up on the Godel company.
1732000	1732640	Give up?
1733680	1734320	Give up?
1734320	1736080	No, no, absolutely.
1736080	1738320	I would never give up on the Godel company.
1738320	1744480	And you see Officer Riley and Officer Wiley sitting in these chairs, smiling real big,
1744480	1746400	kind of laughing to themselves.
1747200	1751520	No, no, we are absolutely not giving up on the Godel company.
1751520	1756400	The Godel company is what's taking us into the future, baby boy.
1756400	1757200	Come on, Neff.
1757200	1757840	Come on.
1757840	1758400	Let's go.
1759120	1760240	Let's go.
1760240	1761920	It's promotion time.
1761920	1765920	Now, you have some videos on your phone, I believe, Julius.
1766480	1768640	Photos, videos, stuff like that.
1768640	1769280	Yeah.
1769280	1770400	Let's see that phone.
1771360	1776080	Before I show you any of this, I, you know, I have some demands.
1776800	1777440	Okay.
1777440	1777840	Okay.
1777840	1778400	Calm down.
1778400	1782960	Demands of one thing, requests or another for our new promotion man.
1783600	1784000	Okay.
1784000	1791760	Well, and Julius reaches into his pocket and pulls out a list that is written on a napkin
1791760	1793360	from where are we?
1793360	1796080	We're at the kids bar.
1797760	1799760	I need a personal assistant.
1799760	1808400	And I want a fully catered breakfast buffet every day from the day goal for the whole
1808400	1808800	staff.
1809360	1810480	Interesting.
1810480	1810880	Wow.
1810880	1811840	That's a weird one.
1812400	1813200	I'm not done.
1813200	1816880	I want your, I want your private executive bathroom.
1817600	1821120	Oh, come in, come in.
1821760	1826640	And I want you to pay for it to get remodeled by the team at Bedeagle.
1828400	1831120	I want full control of what gets played on can.
1832160	1832960	Wow.
1832960	1833840	That's a big one.
1834480	1836560	I want Cal to be the lead anchor.
1836560	1836880	Okay.
1836880	1838800	That's kind of doable more so.
1838800	1844240	I want Beck to get any equipment or really anything that he asked for.
1844240	1846640	Yeah, to a certain monetary amount.
1846640	1847200	Sure.
1847200	1850480	I want the title of executive producer.
1850480	1850880	Okay.
1851920	1855600	I want a free pass from all the cops.
1855600	1864000	Um, the, the, the short jacked one immediately stands up with like almost bald fists and
1864000	1867520	is like, um, uh, sorry, sorry.
1867520	1870720	Um, what did you just say?
1870720	1872880	I don't want to get pulled over for speeding.
1874960	1876080	Oh, okay.
1876080	1877840	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1877840	1880160	Um, no speeding is fine.
1880160	1880960	Fine, fine.
1880960	1881440	Sure.
1881440	1885040	But what did you call us just then?
1885040	1887040	Was it cops, right?
1887040	1889680	I said the cops, city PD.
1890880	1892400	Julia starts to sweat a little bit.
1892400	1898400	He slowly kind of sits back down and says, uh, yeah, that's what I fucking thought.
1899040	1901600	Uh, I, I want hush money.
1901600	1903840	I want them to pay me not to show this.
1904400	1908960	How much, how much do they pay you money?
1908960	1910080	No, no, no.
1910080	1911760	I'm not in it for the money, dude.
1911760	1912480	Come on, man.
1912480	1913760	This is, this is the future.
1913760	1914320	Julius.
1914320	1916400	We're talking about a whole new world, man.
1916400	1918560	We're talking about a million dollars.
1919760	1921680	I mean a bonus, a signing bonus.
1921680	1922960	Is that what we'll talk about it later?
1922960	1924560	We'll get the details down later.
1925600	1927280	Now, listen, this is important.
1927280	1928320	This is an important one.
1928320	1934160	I want a Tony little's gazelle freestyle glider home fitness exercise machine with the workout
1935040	1936080	DVD in my office.
1936720	1938400	Is that like hard to find?
1938400	1938880	I don't know.
1939920	1943200	I remembered it and it's good for your thighs.
1945280	1945600	Okay.
1945600	1946320	I'm almost done.
1948800	1953280	I want to travel and fitness show that runs after the five o'clock news.
1953280	1955200	And I want to call it summer's vacation.
1957440	1962080	He laughs like I just laughed at that one and is like, that actually sounds like a great
1962080	1963440	pitch and we can at least.
1963440	1963840	Yay.
1963840	1965520	We can talk about that for sure.
1965520	1965920	Okay.
1965920	1968960	And then this one, I will not concede on this one.
1968960	1974880	I want the marbles re-installed in the walkway of the entrance and he pulls out a marble
1974880	1976160	from his little pocket.
1976160	1976640	Of course.
1976640	1977040	Yeah.
1977040	1981600	And he flicks it over towards one of the gobs.
1981600	1986160	The tall spindly one kind of catches it as he's reaching out to catch it.
1986160	1988560	Julius pulls out two pistols.
1988560	1989120	Oh my God.
1989680	1991120	Oh my God.
1991120	1994560	And shoots at both of the gobs.
1994560	1995280	Oh my God.
1995280	1995840	Okay.
1995840	1996320	Shit.
1996320	1996640	Fuck.
1996640	2001120	What's your, what's your, uh, what's your dexterity?
2001120	2002880	My dexterity is 75.
2002880	2003440	Okay.
2003440	2003920	Yes.
2003920	2006000	You also caught him by surprise.
2006000	2012560	So you get to go first and that is after your surprise round.
2012560	2016560	So let's start with a deeply surprising round.
2019760	2022720	That's a five, that's a five.
2025360	2026240	Okay.
2026240	2026720	All right.
2026720	2029200	Roll a d10 for each of the shots.
2029920	2030800	Gets these two dudes.
2031600	2032800	A two and a 10.
2032800	2034880	A two and a 10.
2034880	2035600	Okay.
2035600	2038160	You flick this marble in the air.
2038160	2044080	Wilson Wiley, the tall spindly cop reaches up to grab it and you fire directly through
2044080	2047920	his hand with one of your shots as the other one.
2047920	2054560	Hits the marble, which embeds itself directly between the other guy's eyes.
2054560	2055040	Yup.
2055040	2058640	And he has to roll constitution.
2058640	2064880	He does stay conscious, uh, but he's lying flat on the ground at this point.
2064880	2073360	Blood is like spraying out around where the marble has embedded itself and type is freaking
2073360	2075280	the absolute fuck out.
2075280	2084080	But Wilson Wiley immediately dives for cover behind the desk with Tife and flips it on
2084080	2084640	its side.
2085440	2093920	Tife's enormous solid wooden desk is now in between you and Wilson Wiley, the tall spindly
2093920	2101440	cop and Tife Rayland, your uncle, while Richard Riley lays on the floor.
2101440	2103680	Tife yells out to you with his turn.
2103680	2105920	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2105920	2107520	Come on, Julius.
2107520	2109200	What the fuck?
2109200	2111840	I ain't going back to Barstow.
2112480	2116800	And with that, it's Richard Riley's turn and on the ground.
2116800	2120240	He moans back up to the top of the order.
2120240	2121280	It's your turn.
2121280	2123920	Tife, if you're not armed, you better not arm yourself.
2123920	2125280	This is not over.
2125280	2129920	And then he starts running towards the desk towards Wilson.
2130000	2135520	And he wants to, in his mind, he's going to hop the desk, catch Wilson's head between
2135520	2141040	his legs, spin, and then land on the ground with his gun aimed at Tife.
2141040	2141600	Okay.
2141600	2147440	You were super close, so this is just going to be a melee attack, but I need you to roll
2147440	2151520	an athletics first to successfully dive over the desk.
2153520	2154020	Uh-oh.
2155280	2156160	I rolled a 90.
2157040	2160960	90 is not going to do it.
2160960	2167680	So as you're running up, Wilson Wiley just kind of stands at the last possible moment,
2167680	2169600	throws his hands up as kind of a block.
2170240	2172640	His hands are the only thing up above.
2172640	2178640	And so they're kind of grabbing on either side of the inner thighs and just kind of
2178640	2180160	like holds you right there.
2180160	2184240	And you're like sitting on top of the desk at this point in time.
2184320	2188640	And the two of you are grappling each other, essentially at this point.
2188640	2189920	And it's Tife's turn.
2189920	2193680	You can now see him as you're looking down directly at him.
2193680	2198800	And he just kind of sits back and he's like, I don't have a fucking gun, Julius.
2198800	2200480	What the fuck, man?
2200480	2201280	I'm not going to-
2201280	2202080	Good.
2202080	2203440	Yeah, duh.
2203440	2205920	And it's Richard Riley's turn.
2205920	2212960	You hear just kind of this like, ugh, and he's slowly getting himself off the ground
2212960	2218240	behind you, but that's going to take his entire turn to just kind of like right himself at
2218240	2218880	this point.
2218880	2220240	And it's back to you.
2220240	2227360	So Julius is sitting on the overturned desk with Wilson's hands basically clenched between
2227360	2228240	his legs.
2228240	2228740	Yeah.
2229360	2231920	He's going to shoot Wilson right in the face.
2231920	2232640	Jesus Christ.
2234240	2240960	Okay, so because you're within distance of him, he's going to roll unarmed combat against
2240960	2241840	your firearms.
2241840	2242340	Okay.
2243520	2245440	I got a 19.
2245440	2246960	I failed with a 77.
2247680	2250080	Oh, so-
2250080	2251680	So how do you execute this man?
2253840	2259520	Julius is sitting on the overturned desk with Wilson's hands clenched between his thighs.
2260880	2265120	Julius spreads his legs, lets Wilson's hands free.
2266240	2268160	Julius is like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2268160	2270480	And then just shoots him right between the eyes.
2270480	2276080	He's literally like fumbling for his gun and can't get it out of his holster.
2276080	2283440	And as you're firing, he's like, and his gun goes off as well.
2284160	2293200	Typh is there with a bullet through his shin and he's like, whoa, no, what the-
2293200	2295040	Oh my God, he's dead.
2295040	2296080	Oh, he's fucking-
2297040	2299600	As he's throwing up, he's about to pass out.
2299600	2302240	And he's like, I'm about to pass out, man.
2304880	2312800	Yet he just continues to vomit as Richard Riley is finally standing, slowly looking
2312800	2318000	up with you just executing his partner.
2318960	2320720	That's probably good, right?
2320720	2321600	For him?
2321600	2322720	He fires at you.
2326480	2332480	And he puts a bullet right into your shoulder for three points of damage.
2332480	2333920	How many hit points do you have?
2333920	2335200	I was at six.
2335200	2335760	Oh, God.
2337760	2341360	So yeah, he is down to three hit points and it hurts.
2343440	2349040	With that, you need to roll a constitution check in order to stay conscious as you take
2349040	2354240	half of the hit points in damage that you currently have.
2354240	2360320	With a 24, you stay with it and it is your turn once again.
2360320	2363760	This dude behind you has just shot you through the shoulder.
2364560	2369200	There's a dead man in front of you and Typh is puking his brains out with a hole in his
2369200	2370480	shin to the left of you.
2370480	2372240	As soon as Julius gets shot.
2372240	2373840	God damn it.
2374640	2376240	I thought you're fucking dead.
2377200	2382480	You turn around and you see a dude with a marble deeply embedded, so deeply that if
2382480	2389520	you miniaturized yourself to the point to where each hair on an eyebrow was the same
2389520	2395120	height as you and then you walked across his forehead, you would have no trouble traversing
2395120	2395760	the terrain.
2400080	2404400	Julius looks at the guy who just shot him, looks over at his uncle.
2405280	2405840	Fuck.
2406000	2414240	And he walks up to Richard Riley and is going to just try to punch the marble into his brain.
2416320	2417360	Finish what he started.
2417360	2419760	Okay, so he's going to put up a fight here.
2419760	2422080	We're going unarmed combat against each other.
2423040	2424960	He succeeds with an ought six.
2426640	2427440	83.
2427440	2429040	Oh shit.
2429040	2429200	Okay.
2429200	2430480	With one arm.
2430480	2433040	I mean, he got shot through the left shoulder.
2433040	2436240	He rolls a two, so that's only one point of damage.
2436880	2442960	As you go to punch him, he just grabs your arm, kind of throws you back and throws a
2442960	2444800	left hook at you at the same time.
2445680	2452640	Your nose has recently been like completely obliterated and then healed by some sort of
2452640	2453440	wild tech.
2454240	2461520	You immediately feel your nose kind of like bust back open as you go to two hit points.
2461520	2466880	You once again have to roll a constitution check to stay conscious as the world around
2466880	2471200	you vibrates and your stomach just nope.
2471200	2472480	The vibration is gone.
2472480	2479520	Your stomach feels like fucking steel and you've never, ever been more focused.
2479520	2480320	Crit success.
2480880	2481920	Your turn.
2481920	2482720	Let's go.
2482720	2483520	Julius shoots him.
2484960	2486320	He gets punched in the face.
2486880	2493920	No thoughts go through his mind other than this has to end and he just unloads his clip
2493920	2494960	into this guy.
2494960	2495360	Okay.
2495360	2496960	We're on against each other once again.
2498800	2500960	59, which is a pass.
2500960	2502960	26, which is a pass.
2504160	2512000	And as you both go for your guns at the exact same time, you kill him, your back is up
2512000	2512560	against the wall.
2512560	2513760	It's unceremonious.
2513760	2516560	You wanted to do the fun marble thing in your mind.
2516560	2521440	You're like still bummed that you didn't quite finish him off in that way, but you
2521440	2523360	know, you were about to fucking die.
2523360	2523860	Yeah.
2524160	2527280	Julius's vision is kind of tunneling in a little bit.
2527280	2528640	He's losing some blood.
2529280	2536960	His face is on fire from his re-broken nose and who knows probably facial bones as well.
2537840	2539200	Julius walks over to type.
2544000	2547840	Oh, what the fuck, Julius?
2547840	2549840	Julius, seriously, you can't.
2549840	2551920	We were onto something, Julius.
2551920	2554080	We were, we were onto something.
2554080	2556800	What you want and what I want.
2558640	2559440	I don't match up.
2560480	2563840	I have one more thing on my list of demands.
2564960	2566080	Whatever you want.
2566080	2567440	Whatever you want, Julius.
2567440	2568960	Whatever you want is yours.
2568960	2570320	Tell me I'm a real Raylan.
2571680	2573120	I'm a real Raylan?
2573120	2575120	No, you're not a fucking Raylan.
2575120	2579840	A Raylan wouldn't shoot anybody with his cold blood like this coming in my office shooting
2579840	2580240	cops.
2581280	2581840	What is it?
2581840	2584240	Why am I going to have to call the police?
2584240	2586080	Everything's fucked now, man.
2586080	2586960	Everything's fucked.
2586960	2588400	You fucking ruined everything.
2588400	2590000	You fucking ruined everything.
2590720	2597520	Julius holsters the gun that he emptied the clip on, pulls out the one that he still has
2597520	2601360	bullets in, puts it up against type's head.
2601360	2602400	Are you fucking serious?
2602400	2604560	Tell me I'm a real Julius.
2604560	2605600	Tell me I'm a Raylan.
2605600	2607360	Is that what this is about?
2607360	2609280	Tell me I'm a fucking Raylan.
2609280	2611760	You've lost your grip is what, Julius.
2611760	2616480	Tear runs down Julius's face as he pulls the trigger.
2618000	2624560	The body of Typh Raylan slumps down into a pile of his own vomit.
2626720	2629840	Immediately, the body of Wilson Wiley farts.
2633280	2636480	God damn it.
2644160	2646560	I'll never get used to this stench of death.
2646560	2647120	Roll grip.
2652800	2654000	No, that's not going to do it.
2654000	2655840	That's an 89 on a 25.
2656480	2660400	For murdering unarmed family member.
2661040	2663920	I'm going to go ahead and say D4 plus one.
2663920	2664420	Yeah.
2666640	2667440	One plus one.
2667440	2668240	Two grip.
2668240	2670560	And that puts me past a breaking point.
2670560	2671840	Hey, that's fitting.
2674400	2675200	What should we go with?
2675840	2679760	We've got a fucking mess is the situation that you're in.
2680720	2681760	It's a giant mess.
2681760	2687440	Julius just killed his uncle who, you know, whether they got along, he still killed his
2687440	2688560	uncle that he loved.
2689120	2698000	And so Julius, instead of dealing with the horrific situation in front of him, goes somewhere
2698000	2698500	else.
2698960	2700080	Just leaves?
2700080	2702240	No, in his mind.
2702880	2703680	Oh shit.
2704320	2708160	He doesn't see the dead body of Typh Raylan.
2708160	2710400	He doesn't see two dead cops.
2712640	2718160	He sees interesting little figurines reminiscent of-
2718160	2720720	The sculptures from the front yard.
2722880	2723920	And the vomit.
2723920	2724880	A water feature.
2724880	2725380	Of course.
2726080	2726880	The blood.
2726880	2727600	A little pond.
2729120	2731920	He sees little koi fish swimming in it.
2732880	2735760	Oh, Typh wouldn't like this.
2735760	2736880	Oh no, no.
2736880	2738000	He likes it a lot neater.
2738640	2740640	I gotta get this stuff out of here before he sees it.
2740640	2749440	And Julius starts cleaning up the office to get out the sculptures.
2750800	2757120	All right, roll forensics to clean up the murder scene that you just created.
2759200	2759920	An 81.
2760720	2761920	So that's not gonna cut it.
2761920	2763440	That's not gonna cut it.
2763440	2764560	That's not gonna do it.
2765600	2769280	You've gotten the sculptures where?
2769440	2771360	How are you getting rid of these sculptures?
2771360	2772960	Are they in the bathroom?
2772960	2774240	The executive bathroom?
2774240	2775440	They're in a-
2775440	2777760	Well, Typh has his closet-
2777760	2778320	Shower.
2778320	2784720	Well, Typh in the office has his closet full of suits in case he needs to change for a
2784720	2787360	different occasion or if he works late.
2787360	2792720	So Julius gets the sculptures and puts them in the shed.
2793760	2794260	Yep.
2794960	2796640	Which is the closet there.
2796640	2797040	Yep.
2797040	2798640	He kind of likes the water features.
2798720	2801760	He thinks maybe they're not too bad, so he leaves those.
2802960	2806400	Plus he doesn't know how he's gonna fill it in or something.
2806400	2807440	Yeah, it's too much.
2808160	2812080	Julius, he wants to meet back up with his friends, honestly.
2812080	2812960	He's had a hard day.
2814000	2821200	Julius walks out of the office confident that he's at least gotten rid of the sculptures
2821200	2826080	that some people might think are a little gaudy or ugly, but they're hidden away in
2826080	2826960	the shed.
2826960	2835360	He walks out of the office, goes downstairs, and then once he sees the marble entrance
2835360	2836560	without the marbles-
2836560	2837280	Yeah.
2837280	2838960	He kind of comes back to-
2838960	2840240	You hear a voice from behind you.
2844320	2844820	Julius?
2845680	2846240	Julius?
2846240	2848800	And you turn around and it's the intern.
2850000	2856720	Can I get you a coffee or anything?
2856960	2860480	Can you drive me to the Natcher Hole?
2864960	2866080	Okay, where's your car?
2869360	2871200	Roll Persuade.
2874640	2876240	41 on a 60.
2876240	2878640	He fails deeply and he's just like,
2879440	2883600	Oh, oh, fuck, okay, okay, fuck.
2883600	2891200	All right, and he turns around and you see kind of the office has a mass all kind of
2891200	2893200	in hushed tones speaking to each other.
2893200	2894400	People are on their phones.
2894400	2902320	People are taking pictures and video as Jeremy kind of walks toward you nervously looking
2902320	2903280	back at everyone.
2904800	2907600	Okay, okay, we're going to the Natcher Hole.
2908720	2910640	All right, see you guys.
2910640	2912560	Let's go you.
2914960	2915460	Yeah.
2924480	2925040	Stevie!
2925040	2926000	Stevie!
2926000	2926480	Over here!
2926480	2927280	It's us!
2927280	2927920	It's us!
2927920	2928960	It's Cal Colorado!
2928960	2935200	Cal Colorado and Beck Wilder, the two of you are in Cal's vehicle, which is a-
2935840	2937280	Sweet Mercedes C-Class.
2937280	2941920	And you are sitting at the northeast corner of-
2941920	2943200	The Natcher Hole.
2943200	2944320	Oh, look at that.
2944320	2946880	I pointed at each of them and they were like,
2946880	2950400	Hey, I just took notes on this actually.
2954960	2956320	30 more seconds to silence.
2959360	2962240	I was going to comment that your house is so perfectly still.
2962240	2964800	Like that was a real silent silence.
2964800	2965200	Thank you.
2965920	2972240	I mean, if we heard it shift like the foundation or something, like during the 30 seconds of
2972240	2974480	silence, that would be very unsettling.
2975120	2977360	I don't know why I was just like, Oh, you're probably wrong.
2978080	2980160	Well, that's kind of our thing, right?
2982800	2984240	We're supposed to be at the south gate.
2984240	2986640	Are we parked at the northwest corner?
2987920	2991760	My notes say northeast side of the Natcher Hole.
2991760	2993440	What south gate are you talking about?
2993440	2994880	SG, the Natcher Hole.
2995760	2998560	SG, we think, is for Stevie Gotel.
2998560	3000240	Well, now that we've seen her-
3000240	3002400	I was going to say, it's been a while.
3002400	3004240	Scratch, scratch, scratch all that.
3004240	3006320	Yeah, that's the part where I look dumb.
3007200	3007760	That's fair.
3010080	3010640	I do that for me.
3010640	3013120	To be fair, the Natcher Hole used to be a stadium.
3013120	3016320	So having a south gate isn't the most ridiculous thing.
3016320	3017280	No, it's absolutely not.
3020480	3021920	Let's go back to what Thomas said.
3025040	3026160	Let's go to the south gate.
3026800	3030160	I used to work at a church called South Gate.
3030160	3032880	Oh, this is probably pretty triggering for you.
3032880	3034320	Yeah, I was the janitor.
3034320	3035360	That sounds like a nice job.
3035360	3037680	It was lovely as the nighttime janitor.
3037680	3038960	Yeah, nobody's around.
3038960	3040400	You're in a neat big building.
3040400	3043680	I was also like solidifying my lack of faith at that point.
3043680	3046720	So it was a nice setting.
3046720	3048480	Did you just piss on the pews and be like,
3048480	3050240	well, they were clean when I got done with them.
3050240	3051280	Did you play the organ?
3052400	3054000	There was no organ, unfortunately.
3054800	3056480	I grew up in a church with an organ.
3056480	3058480	Very fun, but not that one.
3058480	3058980	Bummer.
3060160	3061200	You want to call for Stevie?
3061200	3061700	Stevie!
3063360	3064640	Stevie, Stevie!
3064640	3065200	Stevie!
3065200	3066000	Stevie!
3066000	3066400	Stevie!
3066400	3067200	It's us!
3067200	3067920	Hey, hey!
3067920	3069200	Cal Colorado!
3069200	3071600	You guys are at the northeast corner of the Natcher Hole.
3071600	3073520	Exactly where we're supposed to be.
3073520	3073840	Exactly.
3073840	3076400	To catch the crooked cops.
3077280	3078560	Got all cops.
3078560	3080480	You saw Stevie, this scrawny little dude
3080560	3084720	wearing cigarette legged jeans and an oversized black hoodie.
3085360	3088000	They have earbuds plugged into their ear holes
3088000	3093040	and a thick wall of dark wavy hair covers their eyes, nose, and top lip,
3093040	3098640	only revealing a black lipstick covered bottom lip, pierced with a small hoop.
3098640	3102720	It's a good thing our trusted comrade and colleague Stevie Gotel is here
3102720	3107120	to help us apprehend these men who are meeting the mysterious and criminal SG.
3107120	3108400	The SG, yep.
3109360	3110800	As written down in their notes.
3113120	3117280	Beck, I'm so glad Stevie's here to help us find the nefarious SG.
3117280	3119200	I thought that meant South Gate.
3119200	3120960	I did too, to be honest.
3120960	3125600	I have many fond memories of coming to this Natcher Hole with my father.
3125600	3127600	We'd always come in the South Gate, the people's gate.
3129360	3130880	He insisted we sit in the bleachers.
3131680	3134320	I wasn't around when it was still a ballpark.
3134320	3138320	I was actually at the game where the sinkhole ate Lefty Rodriguez.
3139360	3140640	Well, he wasn't very good.
3142640	3144000	He insisted on batting right.
3149120	3151440	If you could both roll at a negative...
3152880	3155840	Well, I'll just give you a negative 20 for the conversation that you're having.
3158320	3159120	I fail.
3159120	3160000	I crit fail.
3163840	3164640	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
3164640	3166320	Stevie, Stevie, where did they go?
3167040	3167840	Oh, shit.
3169680	3170240	Stevie?
3171360	3171920	Stevie?
3171920	3180480	As you're looking around, Cal, you look out of the driver's side window and you see that there is
3181280	3189120	blood on the street next to your car and then it's going in a line back around.
3189120	3193440	And then at that very moment, you see Stevie coming back around the front of the car
3194160	3200080	with some sort of contraption in their hand and they are spilling out blood.
3200880	3203200	They finally connect the circle.
3203200	3204240	Oh, I hate blood.
3204880	3206240	I slam on the gas.
3213920	3216240	You described her making the circle for too long.
3219120	3221600	I'm just gonna sit here and let you trap me?
3222240	3226000	Well, I mean, I am going to finish what I was doing because you failed.
3226560	3227200	You check.
3229440	3237840	And so Stevie is muttering something under their breath and as you go to hit the gas
3237840	3244320	and the blood finally meets back up around this Cadillac, I need you both to roll power.
3248560	3249600	Critical success.
3252000	3253280	33 on a 60.
3254000	3256640	I pass a 30 on a 75.
3257440	3263920	Immediately, the two of you are standing in front of a large estate.
3264560	3271280	You're standing on a sort of synthetic, almost bouncy material, like a sidewalk.
3273040	3275520	And there's a row of homes in front of you.
3275520	3281040	And one of these homes is slightly larger, slightly nicer than the rest.
3281120	3283200	Absolutely gorgeous architecture.
3284000	3285760	Well kept garden.
3285760	3286480	Well kept.
3292320	3295280	What's the first thing that goes through Cal Colorado's mind?
3295280	3295920	Oh my God.
3295920	3296560	What the fuck?
3298560	3305040	And in that moment, as you speak with each word that comes out of your mouth,
3305040	3311440	the reality around you sort of loses its shimmer, loses its sharpness.
3312400	3317680	It's almost like you're speaking away the reality that you're currently in.
3317680	3318560	This isn't happening.
3318560	3319440	This isn't happening.
3319440	3320720	I'm in my C class.
3320720	3321920	I'm in my C class.
3321920	3322960	That's where I am.
3322960	3327120	And as you say that, you are sitting in your C class.
3327120	3333120	You're looking over at Beck and Beck's eyes are kind of like rolled back in his head.
3333120	3334240	I started slapping him.
3334240	3336640	Beck Wilder, you feel the slaps?
3337360	3338800	Beck, Beck, come back.
3338800	3339200	Come back.
3339840	3341120	You're in the C class.
3341120	3343040	I'm in the C class.
3343040	3345520	You are Beck Wilder.
3345520	3346640	I'm Beck Wilder.
3346640	3348800	The best damn camera man in the world.
3348800	3351040	I'm the best camera man in the world.
3352400	3352960	What the fuck?
3353680	3354960	Is Stevie still around?
3354960	3360480	In the rear view mirror, you see Stevie Gautilus slipped into the back seat of the Cadillac,
3360480	3362080	seemingly while you were out.
3363040	3365760	However, they are out currently.
3366640	3371760	Eyes kind of rolled back, but like they might come to at any moment.
3372400	3372900	Stevie?
3373920	3374420	Stevie?
3375600	3376160	Cal, hit her.
3376160	3382880	I open my driver's side door and I pour my coffee out on part of the blood circle and
3382880	3385760	try to disperse, like make it no longer complete circle.
3385760	3386160	Cool.
3386160	3386880	Very nice.
3386880	3389920	As you do so, Stevie kind of like rouses.
3389920	3397200	Hey, Stevie, what the fuck?
3398800	3400240	What did you just do to us?
3400240	3400960	That's fair.
3402720	3403200	What's up?
3404960	3412080	Stevie, I don't like to speak harshly to the people that I work with, but you are rapidly
3412080	3415440	declining on my list of favorite can interns.
3415440	3417200	Why don't you tell us what's up?
3417200	3418000	Yeah.
3418000	3418500	Yeah.
3421600	3423200	Stevie, where's Fox?
3423200	3423920	I don't know.
3424640	3426800	I mean, you saw the news, right?
3427440	3428720	Did you take him to the bridge?
3428720	3430960	No, I didn't take him to the bridge.
3430960	3432400	Like that's not Fox.
3432400	3436160	Like that thing just like, I mean, now that it-
3436160	3439840	You admit though that you blew the plant because we were supposed to keep him tied up down
3439840	3441680	there and we could tell that you let him loose.
3441680	3448160	I thought I could, I mean, clearly I'm not as good at it as my dad is.
3449920	3450640	Fuck.
3450640	3453200	That was Grover's Gorge that we saw, wasn't it?
3453200	3457040	Oh, were you in there for a second?
3457040	3457540	Yes.
3458000	3459520	And it was Grover's Gorge.
3459520	3460720	Was it my house?
3460720	3464400	Well, I don't think we visited your house, Stevie, but it was a nice house.
3465280	3465780	Yeah.
3466480	3468080	Those damn bouncy sidewalks.
3468080	3469440	Was that your house?
3469440	3469680	Yeah.
3469680	3471360	I mean, it was probably my house.
3471360	3472880	It's like where it was going to start.
3472880	3474000	Stevie, why did you do this?
3474000	3476160	Did you know a place like home us?
3476160	3478640	Well, I mean, no, it's like in your-
3478640	3480560	That's one of my favorite movies, Stevie.
3481120	3484800	I would appreciate it if you didn't give it negative connotations from me.
3484800	3488000	If I could try, I mean, honestly, if I could do it again, that would be-
3490240	3492800	I think you guys would maybe like-
3492800	3494720	No, I don't think so, Stevie.
3494720	3497200	They want us like dead there, right?
3497200	3498720	Like we escaped a trial.
3498720	3499680	Like you weren't there.
3499680	3501040	You were just there in your brain.
3502000	3506080	Like we all got out together and like I know that I bailed
3506080	3508800	and I'm really sorry about that, but I-
3508800	3509920	So what, Stevie?
3509920	3515760	We spend the rest of our lives in this parking lot, imagining ourselves in Grover's Gorge?
3515760	3516080	Okay.
3516080	3522080	So like it's a little confusing, but mostly I'm just scared right now, honestly,
3522080	3525680	because there's some shit going down.
3525680	3525920	Yeah.
3525920	3528080	Clearly you could handle it yourself, Stevie.
3528080	3534880	Why don't you tell us what the shit is and maybe while we're still your friends,
3534880	3538000	if we're still your friends, we can help you out of it.
3538000	3538320	Okay.
3538320	3542560	So I know the footage got stolen, right?
3543440	3543760	Yes.
3544480	3547360	Beck does a kind of embarrassed nod.
3547360	3552000	And so like I'm getting it back?
3553360	3554800	To give to us or-
3555040	3560080	So like maybe not?
3560080	3564880	Like what, like I had maybe a different plan, but-
3564880	3570560	Cal looks very, very seriously at them and says, Stevie, this is the news.
3572560	3572800	Yeah.
3573600	3579120	It was probably enough to like get my dad to give me whatever I wanted.
3579120	3581040	So I was just going to like-
3581040	3582080	Use it as blackmail?
3582640	3583120	Yeah.
3585120	3585600	You could have-
3587200	3588800	I do not condone blackmail.
3589360	3591360	I thought that you might not.
3591360	3596160	Beck, maybe if you passed a role, definitely Julius, you could have just gotten a copy.
3598960	3601440	But a copy is no good if it goes on the news.
3601440	3604400	If it's already out there, then what's the blackmail good for?
3604400	3605040	I mean-
3605040	3610480	You were all very, very specifically intent on wanting to get it on the television.
3610480	3613440	Stevie, is there really something your father could have given you
3613440	3617760	that was more valuable than a letter of recommendation from Cal Colorado?
3618480	3619120	Yeah.
3619120	3619680	Oh, what?
3621440	3624000	Like name a number or like-
3624000	3624640	Five.
3624640	3625280	Yeah.
3625280	3626080	27.
3626080	3626560	18.
3627120	3628080	Negative 90.
3628080	3628800	11.
3628800	3629280	Okay.
3629280	3631920	Put a million on the end of any of those except for the negative one,
3631920	3633280	because I don't know how that would work out.
3633920	3636720	And then yeah, that's probably like on the table.
3636720	3639360	You would owe him then if it was a negative probably.
3639360	3641840	Oh yeah, so I don't want to do that one.
3641840	3642340	No.
3643600	3651360	But I thought that it might be enough to where I could actually take over
3651360	3654560	and get him to like fuck off, but maybe not.
3654560	3655040	I don't know.
3655600	3657520	Stevie, I've got to question your logic there,
3657520	3663120	that your father would voluntarily give you enough of his fortune for you to take him down with.
3663120	3663360	Yeah.
3663360	3666800	I think in that case, you would just blackmail him to have the company,
3666800	3669920	not for a number that would then be enough to buy it from him.
3669920	3671600	See, this is why you should watch the news.
3676880	3678240	So what do you guys think?
3678240	3679440	How much should I ask for?
3687520	3688880	Cow like sighs deeply.
3689840	3692080	Well, what is he worth?
3692080	3699440	I mean, the company I think is 8.3 something, maybe 8.4, somewhere in there.
3700400	3700640	Bill.
3701200	3702960	Oh, I thought you meant negative million.
3710000	3710240	No.
3713840	3715680	Stevie, do you have the tape?
3716240	3716880	What?
3716880	3718480	Have you made the pickup yet?
3718480	3719120	No.
3719120	3720320	I want to human that.
3722560	3723760	Past 20 on 70.
3724560	3729360	Clearly Stevie was caught completely off guard and it's almost like you
3729360	3733040	stripped them down to their veneer by asking the question.
3733840	3740320	And you can just see right through a very simple like, no, that hasn't happened yet.
3740320	3741840	How did you set up this meeting?
3741840	3743680	Like, did you know the cops?
3743680	3745680	The cops, by the way, did you know that?
3745680	3747440	Well, see, it hasn't even happened yet.
3747440	3751120	So we need to figure out where they are.
3751120	3753120	Yes, I hold on.
3753120	3755040	I'd like a sidebar with Beck.
3755040	3756000	Yeah, for sure.
3756000	3758320	Could you put yourself in your circle or something?
3762320	3764640	Just do like a really tiny one in your seat there.
3764640	3768160	Or just, you know, you could remake the one you made and we'll step out of the car.
3768160	3768480	Okay.
3768480	3774800	So I, because you guys both like passed your power and especially with the crit success,
3774800	3780160	like I didn't have you roll grip in the moment and that starting to feel a little bit.
3780160	3783680	You're right, but I could see this dawning on us how fucked up with that was.
3783680	3787120	I mean, as you say, as you mentioned that we didn't take a grip test, I'm like,
3787120	3790640	oh yes, by the way, Stevie, what the fuck?
3791440	3791940	Yeah.
3793840	3794800	Can you both roll grip?
3796800	3797200	Pass.
3797200	3799040	10 on a 42.
3799040	3801280	I pass a 25 on a 49.
3802080	3807440	You were both whisked away somewhere mentally for a second, but it's not as if they couldn't
3807520	3812800	have, you know, maybe projected some sort of image onto your eyeballs or something technologically
3812800	3817280	speaking, like something could have happened that made you feel like you were elsewhere.
3817280	3821360	And I don't know, like we were real tired and just dozed off real quick.
3821360	3822000	Yeah.
3822000	3822880	Quick nap.
3822880	3823360	Why not?
3823360	3824960	That makes way more sense than mine.
3826240	3830960	I'm like, it's some wild tech thing that it's hot and new in the city.
3830960	3833600	Cause you know, the tech in the city is getting out of hand these days.
3833600	3834400	Not even in the city.
3834400	3836800	Like it could just be Grover's Gorge tech.
3836800	3838640	We saw all kinds of amazing things there.
3838640	3841680	It makes sense that they, oh, you did a little VR.
3841680	3844640	Like what are those in the fluid?
3844640	3846800	Like aggressive attack VR.
3848160	3848880	That's awesome.
3848880	3852880	Actually, there are nano projectors in the fluid that you encompass.
3852880	3855600	You know how they film the Mandalorian on that circular green screen?
3855600	3856000	Right, right.
3856000	3856480	Yeah.
3856480	3859040	It's like that, but a portable technology.
3860000	3860500	Yeah.
3861040	3864880	That's I don't think that they have that like here, but that sounds like a Grover's Gorge
3864880	3865200	kind of thing.
3865200	3865600	Exactly.
3865600	3866160	It was wild.
3866240	3866960	Remember what they did?
3866960	3868640	You know, when you got jackaloped?
3868640	3869140	Yeah.
3869680	3870640	Picture right up.
3870640	3873280	So of course they could Mandalorian us in my C class.
3873280	3874400	Deck feels his backside.
3875120	3875440	Yeah.
3875440	3876000	I remember.
3876000	3879520	It feels better than you think as you have the memory of the pain.
3881040	3887760	And Stevie just kind of like slips out of the Mercedes Cadillac.
3887760	3891040	And Stevie just kind of slips out of the Cadillac at this point.
3891040	3893040	What's it for fucking Mercedes?
3893040	3893680	Other way around.
3894640	3901280	And Stevie, why don't you stay right there in the back seat and we'll slip out.
3901280	3901840	Okay.
3901840	3902560	Gotcha.
3902560	3903040	Of this.
3903040	3904160	What kind of car is this?
3904160	3905360	It's a Mercedes C class.
3905360	3905860	Cool.
3908080	3908580	Yeah.
3908580	3910400	Which Luke assured us was nice.
3918400	3918640	Okay.
3918640	3923440	So we slip out of the car, but back since we lost sight of Stevie.
3923440	3928080	So easily a few minutes ago is going to like be staring into the back seat as we talk.
3928080	3928320	I think.
3928320	3928820	Yeah.
3930160	3931440	What you got cow?
3931440	3933520	Well, that's the question back.
3933520	3934880	What do we have here?
3934880	3938320	I mean, I've been kind of nervous about once we get to this point in every place we've
3938320	3941760	gone so far about like how we physically get it back.
3941760	3944400	Like they probably got guns, dude.
3944400	3945840	And they're expecting Stevie.
3946480	3951920	If we can keep Stevie on our side, I think they're our best bet at getting the footage back.
3952480	3955760	So we probably need to stay out of sight though for the handoff, right?
3955760	3957200	I don't think we can be a part of it.
3957760	3963360	Cal is thinking very seriously for a minute and he says, I think our best bet at getting
3963360	3969600	the footage and showing the public is if for now we let Stevie believe that they can go
3969600	3971040	through with the blackmail.
3971040	3971280	Yeah.
3971280	3977840	I think at the very least cow vomits on the steering wheel or remember we're out of the
3977840	3978080	car.
3978080	3978880	You're in the car.
3978960	3980000	God damn it.
3981840	3983440	You are where we can see you.
3985760	3986720	It's really smart.
3986720	3988880	That's what we mean when we say family.
3988880	3990320	Beck wants to open his door real quick.
3990320	3991120	Pop his head in.
3991120	3993280	Stevie, what was the like terms of the deal?
3993280	3997120	Were you going to pay them money or how are you going to get the stuff from them?
3997120	4001040	Oh, they're like, uh, already on the gato payroll.
4001040	4004720	So I just acted like they just think you're an agent of.
4004720	4005280	Exactly.
4005280	4005600	Yeah.
4005600	4008720	You're like the next higher up that they're passing it on to.
4008720	4010320	What time are you supposed to meet them, Stevie?
4010320	4011600	Uh, well, they're late.
4012240	4012480	Fuck.
4013600	4014320	Beck looks around.
4014320	4015680	Where were you supposed to meet them?
4015680	4016720	Like the south gate?
4016720	4017520	Yeah, the south gate.
4017520	4018480	Oh, the people's gate.
4018480	4021840	You know, I used to go there with my father, but we don't have time for that Stevie.
4025760	4027840	You need to go right away.
4027840	4029680	We're going to let you carry out your blackmail.
4029680	4030080	What?
4030080	4030640	Really?
4030640	4032240	We think it's for the good of the people.
4032240	4033600	Yeah, it is.
4033600	4036400	And then once you've got yours, we get ours.
4036400	4036960	That's right.
4036960	4038000	We need a copy though.
4038000	4038320	Okay.
4038320	4038640	Yeah.
4038640	4040240	You guys get a exclusive.
4040240	4042720	Like you're the first people who get it right.
4042720	4044000	Cal looks hard at Beck.
4044000	4044400	Yeah.
4044400	4046880	Beck returns the same kind of face.
4046880	4048400	So you guys look hard at each other?
4048400	4048880	Yeah.
4048880	4049200	Yeah.
4049200	4049760	Real hard.
4050320	4050480	Yeah.
4050480	4051120	It's hot.
4051120	4052880	And then, um, don't.
4053920	4056800	I mean, what do you expect me to fucking do with that?
4056800	4058720	I said, no, you can just don't.
4058720	4062320	I like bit down on that laugh earlier and it still came out.
4062320	4064000	I like really tried to hold it in.
4064000	4066400	I just specifically leave the part out where I say it's hard.
4066400	4067920	So the fucking discord doesn't.
4070080	4076240	The spoiler chat just doesn't become the horniest place on earth.
4076240	4078720	And even though what we're saying is funny right now, please cut it.
4079760	4082160	Because I'm serious about those discord fucks.
4085760	4087120	Can't give them an itch.
4087120	4089680	You're gonna have to say something way worse for it to get cut.
4092240	4093200	Don't try to bait me.
4093280	4096320	All right.
4096320	4096560	Back.
4096560	4097520	Do you want to try to bait him?
4102160	4107040	Cow looks real hard at Beck Beck gets an erection.
4119920	4121040	That's not appropriate.
4121040	4127120	That even though you could read into it some other way, what we have here is a father son
4127120	4128160	type dynamic.
4128160	4128720	Oh yeah.
4128720	4129040	No.
4129040	4130720	So knock it off for sure.
4130720	4131040	For sure.
4131040	4131520	For sure.
4131520	4131840	For sure.
4133520	4134800	Which one of you is this step?
4137680	4138560	I'm the daddy.
4139360	4140080	I'm the daddy.
4144720	4145920	So now it's in your hands, Zach.
4146480	4148320	What you unleash on the world.
4152000	4153360	On the edit, baby.
4153360	4154160	It's on the edit.
4155120	4155440	We'll see.
4156640	4159120	Stevie, you got to, you should get going then.
4159120	4160480	You're going to, you have to meet them.
4160480	4163600	Well, yeah, I was just popping out because I'm hungry.
4163600	4165040	Oh, are you meeting them in the subway?
4165040	4169120	Oh, yeah, they're going to meet me down by the subway.
4169120	4172560	If you're meeting them in the subway, couldn't you have just gotten a sandwich there?
4172560	4174880	Oh my God.
4174880	4176080	I'm so stupid.
4176880	4177840	Why did I talk like that?
4177840	4180080	Stevie, Stevie, you're not stupid.
4180080	4183360	You're just at the beginning of your life and you've got a lot to learn.
4183360	4183840	Yeah.
4183840	4185200	But I believe in you, kiddo.
4185200	4186000	That's awesome.
4186720	4188000	That's so cool.
4188000	4190560	Okay, well, do you guys want to like come with me or?
4190560	4195760	I don't think they should see us, but if you wanted to, I don't know,
4195760	4201760	FaceTime us from your phone pocket or something or from your shirt pocket with your phone in it.
4201760	4203120	Yeah, I'll put you in my hoodie pocket.
4203680	4206240	I mean, I've already got your earbuds in all the time.
4206240	4209440	So like that's, that's kind of my steez, right?
4209440	4211360	So like, they're not going to know that.
4211360	4212560	I thought your name was Stevie.
4212560	4213440	It's Stevie.
4213440	4217920	And they're not going to know that I've got one earbud that's talking to you guys.
4217920	4219360	Beck, I thought their name was Stevie.
4219360	4219860	Yeah.
4220240	4222880	No, Stevie's like a thing that you say.
4222880	4224880	They say like kids say it.
4224880	4226240	Like we say it.
4226800	4234720	Oh, everybody says here in the city in 2022, all the kids are saying Stevie.
4234720	4240960	And at that moment, you see a familiar car turn the corner
4241920	4245360	inside this parking garage and pull up next to you.
4245920	4246640	How familiar?
4247200	4249600	Well, how much do you know about?
4250160	4251360	Julia Summers?
4251360	4251860	No.
4254000	4257520	The intern, Jeremy and what he drives.
4257520	4265680	Cal, uh, to answer your question, Cal looks over and says, who the fuck is that?
4268000	4271200	I think if it's, if it's an internet can Beck would know.
4271200	4276400	Who got you coffee and energy drinks earlier, like yesterday and like for your jobs and stuff.
4276400	4279200	It was the one that was running alongside our car.
4279200	4279680	Absolutely.
4279680	4280480	This is Jeremy.
4281680	4282880	Dude, Cal, it's Jeremy.
4282880	4287440	And sitting shotgun is decide.
4288800	4289200	Oh no.
4289200	4293680	I'm just going to wait for Luke to like describe what you guys see as sitting shotgun.
4293680	4294240	Nice.
4294240	4294560	Hell yeah.
4294560	4296800	That's also perfectly in time with when I need to pee.
4302320	4304800	All right, let's get down to the end of the app.
4305440	4311920	Cal Colorado in the driver's seat of his Mercedes C-class Beck Wilder sitting shotgun.
4313600	4319200	And pulling up is the car of Jeremy, the city action news intern.
4320000	4322480	He's driving and sitting shotgun.
4323600	4324320	What do they see?
4325360	4331360	Julius opens the door, hops out of the passenger's seat, looks at Jeremy.
4332640	4333140	Thanks.
4334480	4340480	Slams the door and goes to get in the back seat of Cal's car.
4340480	4346240	Cal presses the lock button and crank, like rolls down the driver's window, just a tad.
4346240	4350400	Which makes sense because when you look at Julius Summers, you see.
4351200	4357760	He is covered in blood and like bits of brain and flesh.
4357760	4358260	What?
4359280	4360800	Oh shit.
4360800	4361360	We're all good.
4362080	4363120	You got promotions.
4363120	4364400	I got promotions.
4364400	4365520	Julius, dude.
4365520	4367200	Dude, Julius, you're covered.
4367200	4369520	What's the, yeah, Julius, you are.
4369520	4372320	Oh, there's a lot of viscera on you.
4372320	4375760	There was water features and stuff like a fountain.
4376400	4377120	It got all wet.
4377760	4378400	Yeah.
4378400	4378900	What?
4380000	4380500	Yeah.
4381440	4382480	Blood fountain?
4382480	4383280	That's blood, dude.
4383840	4384880	Are you hurt?
4384880	4388560	Julius looks down at himself and is like, I'm fine.
4388560	4391440	My face hurts a little bit, but I'm good.
4391440	4393920	What do we see if we look at his face specifically?
4393920	4394420	Blood.
4395360	4397440	No, but no like specific face trauma.
4397440	4399120	No wounds or injury.
4399200	4402560	You can't really, you wouldn't really be able to tell through the blood.
4402560	4403120	Yeah.
4403120	4410160	And he seems to be, maybe there's like a hole in his shoulder and he's probably like kind
4410160	4412720	of holding it just a little bit.
4412720	4418640	Julius, just so we're clear here, you think you're just a little wet right now?
4419360	4420400	Yeah, it'll be fun.
4420400	4421040	From water?
4421600	4422400	From the fountain.
4423120	4427360	Well, if you were, wouldn't I be terrified because that's my phobia?
4429120	4441360	That's a wrap on the episode.
4441360	4442160	God damn it.
4442160	4442880	Holy shit.
4444240	4444880	Holy shit.
4444880	4446800	And you said pieces of viscera, like brain?
4447360	4447860	Yeah.
4447920	4448420	Wow.
4450160	4450660	Wow.
4452560	4453680	What's happening now?
4455040	4455840	Holy shit.
4459120	4466880	It's all mine for, cause my life is great.
4468000	4481200	And it's all mine, cause my life is great.
4482080	4492160	For if I do, my mom would say.
4492160	4493200	God damn.
4493200	4495600	See, old women were terrifying in the nineties.
4498800	4500640	That aesthetic was not fucking chill.
4505120	4508400	That was like an Andrew Dice Clay crowd shot.
4511200	4513440	Whoa.
4513440	4514480	He made his mistake.
4514480	4517600	Relatable moment.
4518160	4518640	Hell yeah.
4518640	4521360	Raffi even Raffi makes mistakes.
4522000	4522320	Okay.
4522320	4523600	Can't believe he did it.
4523600	4530400	And we back and we back and we back and we back and we back and we back.
4530400	4537600	Welcome everyone to the 26th episode of season two of pretending to be people.
4541200	4541600	Wow.
4546000	4547360	I'm curious guys.
4547360	4549840	We've, we've been through a lot and it's been a while.
4549840	4553760	And last we left you, we left you on a bit of a cliffhanger, but let's not talk about
4553760	4554560	that.
4554560	4559440	We just did four full episodes as different characters.
4559440	4560560	I don't know if it's the headphones.
4560560	4562080	You sound crazy blown out to me.
4562080	4562580	Yeah.
4563360	4564800	So you might want to check that before we.
4565760	4566880	What the fuck were you talking about?
4566880	4569360	I was trying to think of words that rhymed with all your names.
4570000	4572400	All right, let's run it down.
4572400	4573200	Joe.
4573200	4576000	Have you ever seen Joe blowing his load down by the bay?
4577520	4578720	That's as far as I got.
4578720	4580320	Okay, well let's go to Thomas.
4581440	4582480	That's where I got stuck.
4582480	4582720	Right.
4582720	4585600	So I guess me next probably would be easier.
4585600	4595040	Have you ever seen Zach attack a rack of snacks down by the shack where he's at down
4595040	4598160	by the bay?
4598160	4598560	Mac.
4598560	4603840	Have you ever seen Justin busting down by the bay?
4605280	4606960	It was like Michael unicycle.
4606960	4609200	I was taking inspiration from the man himself.
4609920	4612320	What Michael on a unicycle.
4612320	4612640	Yeah.
4612640	4614800	He just said, have you ever seen Michael?
4614800	4615120	Unicycle.
4615120	4619360	And then he paused and he said, unicycle down by the bay.
4620000	4621280	Well, rhymes with Thomas.
4621280	4621780	Promise.
4623680	4624180	No.
4625520	4626020	Okay.
4626720	4627840	Is that the only thing, Thomas?
4631120	4631840	Dude, I don't know.
4631840	4632880	My last name is a lot more.
4632880	4633600	I mean your whole.
4633600	4634320	Oh, right.
4634320	4636240	That would have been the move.
4636240	4638160	Can't think of anything that rhymes with that either.
4638160	4638660	I saw.
4639360	4644400	I saw Thomas Cox box of Fox eating locks in his socks.
4644400	4645120	Kicking rocks.
4645120	4646080	Kicking rocks.
4646080	4646880	Getting off his rocks.
4646880	4647600	Getting off.
4648720	4648880	Yeah.
4648880	4650080	You can play around with all that.
4650080	4650320	Yeah.
4650320	4651360	Down by the bay.
4652160	4653760	So everyone's jerking off.
4653760	4653920	Yeah.
4653920	4654800	Except for me.
4654800	4656000	I'm attacking a rat.
4657200	4658560	I was watching a box.
4658560	4659520	Oh, is that code?
4659520	4660960	Is that euphemism?
4660960	4661680	No, no, no, no.
4661680	4663360	We were just attacking the rat.
4663360	4664480	You got to do me now.
4665760	4668000	I saw Luke eating puke down by the bay.
4668000	4672080	Have you ever seen Luke eating so much cum that he pukes down by the bay?
4672080	4672560	Oh no.
4673600	4674320	Never eat the beach.
4674320	4675200	Real good energy.
4677200	4678960	Definitely a good take to stick with.
4679680	4681680	Down by the bay.
4682640	4685440	And it's all my fault.
4701360	4707040	In season two, episode 16 of the Pokemon anime, Go West Young Meowth, Meowth reveals that he
4707040	4710960	stumbled across a female Meowth when he was young and fell head over heels for her.
4710960	4716160	She didn't return his affection though because she had a rich trainer and said Meowth and
4716160	4721440	saw Meowth as a street Meowth who couldn't impress her because he wasn't human.
4721440	4724080	So Meowth decided to make himself as human as he could.
4724080	4728640	He learned to walk on two legs by watching people practice at a local dance academy,
4728640	4733760	which also just so happens to offer pronunciation lessons over time.
4733760	4737520	And with a little help from a picture book, he learned to sound out words.
4737520	4742000	Unfortunately, that didn't impress the female Meowth who went so far as to call him a freak.
4742640	4746640	A broken hearted Meowth eventually left to join team Rocket because Rocket
4746640	4749440	was the first word he ever understood the meaning of.
4752240	4757520	According to the logic of this episode then, there isn't anything special about Meowth
4757520	4759040	that makes them able to talk to humans.
4759040	4763200	Theoretically, any Pokemon that is able to speak their own name articulately
4763200	4764880	could learn our language.
4764880	4768800	They just need the proper motivation, a little help, and a lot of determination.
4768800	4771600	That makes us wonder why more Pokemon haven't bothered to learn our language.
4772160	4777040	It took Pikachu almost 20 years to finally speak in Pokemon I Choose You,
4777040	4779440	and that might have just been a hallucination.
4779440	4784560	And he even needed help from Ryan Reynolds and a pretty wild plot twist to speak in
4784560	4786560	the Detective Pikachu movie.
4786560	4790080	Shouldn't Pikachu have been motivated to talk to Ash way before that?
4790160	4792560	Wait, was Pikachu in love with Ash?
4792560	4797680	Because romantic love was the only thing to drive a Pokemon previously to learn English.
4797680	4798480	I don't think he was.
4800320	4804080	But then again, having more Pokemon speak like humans would probably run some of the
4804080	4805280	magic of the franchise.
4806240	4809520	It's part of the series charm that they can only say their names.
4809520	4811440	It also makes Meowth special.
4811440	4815120	Of course, maybe Pikachu doesn't care about Ash as much as Team Rocket's Meowth
4815120	4816560	cared about the other Meowth.
4817120	4820080	Oh, so they were on the same page as me?
4820080	4822000	Yeah, that was written by Seamus Kelly.
4822000	4822880	Thanks Seamus.
4822880	4824080	Wow, what a-
4824880	4830480	Radio Hedge Fund, nice, says it does also make Team Rocket idiots.
4830480	4834240	They want to capture a nondescript Pikachu because he is in some way special,
4834240	4836080	and yet they have a talking Meowth.
4836800	4838400	The only one in the world.
4838400	4842160	This little guy is beyond special, and yet they mistreat him all the time.
4842720	4847760	Chris says, Slowking also spoke in Pokemon 2000.
4847760	4849760	Slowking.
4850800	4855440	Dude, I'm so Slowking stoked for this episode we're about to record.
