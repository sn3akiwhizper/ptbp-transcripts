0	5000	Happy holy days, my friends and my families.
5320	10320	Me, Wolf the dog, and my dog, Wolf the dog,
10480	15480	are wishing you a happy one live from 694.2 PTBP,
16840	20220	the holiest and jolliest station
20220	22880	this side of the northern pole.
22880	26380	My producer also sends his eternal love
26380	30340	through a mix of wild vibrations and chatterings.
30340	31980	What a fun dude.
31980	34060	And speaking of fun dudes,
34060	36400	this year howling with Wolf is from Curtis
36400	40220	and his friend Jared, both in St. Louis.
40220	44080	Curtis tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod,
44080	47380	the merriest and most cheerful act of giving
47380	50300	outside of ripping a hole in the corner
50300	52540	of a grease-filled diner dumpster
52540	55940	and squeezing that big old nasty metal box
55940	59880	like a piping bag until the sludge slips and slides
59880	63540	right into Wolf's gaping inscrutable maw.
63540	66200	Mm, baby.
66200	68980	But the tweet thing is pretty good too.
68980	72920	Curtis writes, hello Wolf, master of grease,
72920	75860	time travel, trash, and dumpster grease.
75860	79840	First off, thank you for all the new songs you always bring
79840	82540	and for continuing to keep us up to date
82540	86140	on the continual and confusing adventures
86140	89740	of the Contention PD and City News crew.
89740	92820	My friend who's listened to all the episodes
92820	96300	made sure to ask you not to spoil anything for me
96300	98220	like the Christmas episodes,
98220	101900	the fate of Jack Russell's soft, velvety eye bags,
101900	105820	or the Contention Creek Critter Coalition, or the turtle.
105820	108220	Stay frosty and fuck the zuck.
108220	111620	Well, damn, thanks, Curtis.
111620	113580	I appreciate that you acknowledge
113580	117600	that I am the master of both grease and dumpster grease,
117600	120020	two different food groups that I use
120020	122660	for very different reasons.
122660	125580	And Curtis, stay greasy.
125580	127740	Now, if you wanna write up something
127740	131140	for your jolly wolf to how, it's real simple.
131140	133620	Post about pretending to be people on the internet
133620	137700	and tag at PretendingPod, or write up a five-star review
137700	140340	in the podcast app of your choice.
140340	144100	Screenshot that stunning work of art
144100	147180	and get that proof in front of my eyeballs
147180	150760	so that I may provide you with your just rewards.
150760	153300	Your reward of putting words in wolf's mouth
153300	156380	is just a few taps of the fingers away.
156380	159580	Those taps go on links, and the links,
159580	163260	the links are in the show notes.
163260	165660	Quick reminder, we're taking new
165660	168420	and upgrading Patreon subscriptions.
168420	171380	We're matching them and we're donating the total
171380	173820	to a crisis cold weather shelter
173820	178580	in the PTBP Boys' hometown of Springfield, Missouri.
178580	181580	Join the Patreon and you'll get fun rewards
181580	186260	like exclusive merch, access to behind-the-scenes live video

190140	194380	the ability to submit an NPC and location
194380	195980	to be used in the show,
195980	200980	and a confidential audio feed with 38 bonus episodes.
201260	204460	Coming later this month, the first episode
204460	207560	of Thomas' Oops All Petty Mores arc.
207560	209620	You're gonna wanna hear the boys
209620	212580	make their way back to contention.
212580	214620	And since we're raising money this month
214620	216380	to help folks stay warm,
216380	218980	we're combining this thing with a raffle.
218980	222500	Every five bucks subbed or upped on Patreon
222500	224800	gets you an entry to the raffle.
224800	226160	At the end of December,
226160	228800	we'll randomly select three winners.
228800	232000	The first two will receive a PTBP shirt
232000	234760	with the design of their choice from the merch store

237200	241120	including the new season two Patreon exclusive designs
241120	243440	that will be announced at the end of this month.
243440	247160	And that third winner of the raffle can also have a shirt.
247160	250920	Oh, and they will be invited to play in a one-shot homebrew
250920	252760	written and run by Zach,
252760	257080	alongside Joe, Luke, and Thomas as their fellow players.
257080	259880	So if you want to maybe get a shirt
259880	263080	or play at the PTBP virtual table,
263080	265560	join up before December is over.
265560	267720	Time's running out, baby.
267720	270660	But I am not running out of time,
270660	274300	for time is merely a tool at my disposal.
274300	278520	Mm, I love two things in this here world.
278520	280960	A good bout of disposing.
281000	282960	And the news.
282960	285760	Last time, our assumed heroes showed
285760	289180	some actually unbelievable footage to their editor,
289180	292000	Vivica, perhaps breaking her mind.
292000	295080	And then Kurt, the red-eye siren chaser,
295080	297100	showed up with some wild footage
297100	299560	of a new weather phenomenon.
299560	302160	Absolutely exhausted and spent,
302160	304480	Julius Summers headed to the hospital
304480	307680	while Beck and Cal made their way back to Cal's
307680	311600	to check on Stevie and Greg Fox god-goddle.
311600	314360	But they found neither of the god-goddle's siblings,
314360	317600	and the bindings that tied down the wet god-goddle
317600	319720	had been cut by scissors.
319720	323960	Beck Wilder and Cal Colorado sped on empty tanks
323960	327160	to Bean's Bridge to assess the scene after that
327160	330240	seemingly god-caused freak weather incident
330240	331640	from Kurt's footage.
331640	335440	Too tired to succeed, but too driven to hit the brakes,
335480	338600	Cal maneuvered past the police barricades
338600	340760	and taken us now to a better view
340760	345680	of Bean's Bridge's new, unnaturally smooth hole.
345680	348840	It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great,
348840	350840	and it's all mine, all.
350840	351720	Oh.
380840	381680	Oh.
387680	388520	What is that?
388520	389340	The noise.
389340	390180	Yeah.
390180	392280	That's part of why I was making that face,
392280	393360	because I was like, if there's a noise,
393360	394960	just say it so we don't have to do this.
394960	395800	But what is it?
395800	397800	The timer for the lights.
397800	399000	Oh.
399000	400960	It's just that it's not a digital one,
400960	402880	it's just literally this mechanical thing
402880	407480	that's just like, so I can absolutely just unplug that.
407480	410320	I didn't notice it, and I bet you it's the kind of thing
410760	412640	that the 30 seconds of silence would cancel out.
412640	413680	It will cancel out.
413680	414600	Sorry, what did you say?
414600	417200	I couldn't hear it over the enormously loud clicking
417200	418040	in my ears.
422440	424840	It's episode 19 of Pretending to be People.
425720	428880	Wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham,
428880	433300	wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, season two.
433300	434640	Season two.
434640	436080	Episode 19.
436080	436920	Episode 19.
438080	438920	Whoa.
440720	441560	Episode 19.
441560	442400	COVID-19.
445520	447200	You know what that reminds me of?
448400	450840	19, nine one, nine 11.
453240	455000	Welcome to the numerology episode
455000	457200	of Presenting to be People.
457200	460440	I crashed my Scion TC at 100 miles an hour.
460440	462880	I crashed my Scion TC.
462880	466040	I don't care, it's numbers.
466480	471480	So Taylor and I were at Ramatai eating lunch the other day
471520	476520	and we went inside and there was the loudest conversation
476640	478480	happening right behind us.
478480	481320	We were the only two groups of people eating
481320	483760	in this tiny living room converted
483760	486240	into a restaurant dining room.
486240	488800	And this loud, loud conversation,
488800	492960	the first sentence that I heard was one young gentleman
492960	495880	college age asked the other young gentleman college age,
496600	498360	what is it about your actions and behavior
498360	500580	make you think you're not an incel?
502400	503800	Oh damn, so it's-
503800	504800	Incelvention?
504800	507400	Yes, it was an incelvention.
507400	509220	Incelvention are just like bullying
509220	511860	and it's the same dynamic as the guys
511860	513480	in White Lotus season two.
513480	515480	They're just still in college.
515480	517320	Yes, it's essentially that,
517320	521280	well, and after the whole thing went down.
521280	524880	The fish, but the one guy wouldn't let the other one have it.
524880	526120	At one point in time, he's like,
526120	528160	you're obsessed with women.
528160	530640	And the guy was like, I'm not obsessed with women,
530640	532400	I'm obsessed with beauty.
535400	537340	And then he's like, don't you think it's not okay
537340	540480	to say things to girls that make them uncomfortable?
540480	545480	And his response to that was, I say things that move me.
545880	548480	They also don't like your skin suits that you wear.
550040	551880	At one point in time, I thought the conversation
551880	553920	was sort of veering into a like,
554080	556600	oh, he actually said, do you understand
556600	558520	that this is serial killer behavior?
558520	559360	What?
559360	562240	He was like, you're messaging these girls repeatedly,
562240	564920	they're not responding to you in their DMs
564920	567320	and you continue to message them.
567320	570020	And he's like, I don't send them questions,
570020	571360	I send them things.
571360	573400	You don't have to respond to things.
573400	574240	Oh no.
574240	576320	No, this is not good.
576320	577920	He's like, when people send me things,
577920	580320	I don't always respond to them.
580320	581560	It's pretty cool.
581560	583160	They were peers, they were the same age.
583240	585240	They seemed to be the same age, yeah.
585240	587780	Much older women in nursing homes.
591560	593240	Okay, they don't respond because some of them
593240	596240	are physically incapable of moving their thumbs.
596240	598120	I was wondering if it was maybe like a dad
598120	599160	having a talk with his son.
599160	601480	Oh no, that would have felt more appropriate.
601480	604080	I was on the side of the antagonist.
604080	607120	I really thought you were about to say the incel.
607120	608920	I was on the side of the incel.
608920	613680	I too am obsessed with beauty, sir.
614800	618400	You should see my campaigns, they're quite beautiful
618400	619600	if dark.
623040	625560	The aggressor was like,
625560	629080	what would Jesus think of your behavior?
629080	629920	Yeah, the guy who was like-
629920	631880	Is that what it's called in an intervention?
633880	634880	It will be in mine.
635480	639520	And if all of you were aggressors,
639520	641060	we'd get out of my house.
643800	645800	It's offensive defense.
645800	650040	Oh no, I'm feeling really suppressed right now.
650040	651800	Y'all are some suppressive people,
651800	656760	and me and the drugs are gonna stay right here.
656760	660200	So it did end eventually with,
660200	663720	actually Taylor got up as we were leaving,
663720	666520	walked over to their table and said,
666520	668800	after we witnessed both servers
668800	670300	coming in and out of this room,
670300	673840	like looking over tentatively every single time,
673840	675040	Taylor went over and was like,
675040	677200	hey, everyone can hear your conversation,
677200	679000	it's making everyone uncomfortable.
680320	681840	And then everyone clapped.
683400	685920	We raised her up in a chair, carried her out,
685920	687240	we got to keep the chair.
689800	691780	I went back to Ramatai a week later,
691780	693180	because I love Ramatai.
693180	695180	They were still having the conversation.
696260	697100	Makes sense.
697100	699920	Is this guy just like a series of copy pastas you read?
701460	702300	Copy pasta.
702300	703220	Is that how you say that?
703220	704760	No, it's not, you say copy pasta.
704760	706100	You could have gotten me.
706100	707780	Yeah, you're a jiff.
707780	709460	Yeah, I would have gotten your jiff ass.
709460	710860	All right, fuck you, get out of the room,
710860	713860	we're role playing, you're in the hospital.
713860	714980	I'm still not playing yet?
714980	716660	Yeah, I know, it sucks.
716660	717500	We're about to play you,
717500	719180	but first of all- For two fucking hit points?
719180	721880	Maybe you shouldn't have gotten the shit kicked out of you.
721880	724760	Joe and I have written up pretty extensive backstories
724760	728620	for your critical care team that we're gonna be playing.
728620	730540	That's what I was doing outside.
730540	733340	I was on nurse talk to see good tips
733340	735300	on patient health care.
735300	737420	Well, let's get this going.
737420	740700	Thanks for telling me it wasn't me in Ramatai.
743860	745220	I'm glad you kept that to yourself.
745220	746660	You're fine with Thomas knowing.
746660	747500	I'm sad.
749220	751100	So, did they look like peers?
751100	753380	I'm like, well, they look about the same age.
753380	757020	Thanks for not telling about me dressing down my dad.
762780	764700	Okay, no lie though, I could see your dad saying,
764700	766820	I say things that move me.
768900	770700	He wouldn't be talking about the same kinds of things
770700	772700	this boy was saying, but.
774160	775000	We're standing at a hole.
775040	777520	Standing at a hole in the middle of a bridge.
777520	779120	So, and you'll remember from the footage
779120	783000	that it did seem to close up in the footage that you saw.
783000	783840	I didn't remember that from the footage.
783840	784940	Yeah, I didn't remember that at all.
784940	786120	It had left a giant hole
786120	788040	and that's why the tugboat was swirling.
788040	792000	So, the tugboat swirled down along with its barge behind it,
792000	794400	but then after some time of the swirling,
794400	796900	after the tugboat and barge disappeared,
796900	798920	it's almost like it got stopped up.
798920	800080	I thought it got equalized.
800080	801840	I thought enough water had rushed in.
801840	802720	Gotcha, okay.
802720	805560	So, now the river is flowing normally,
805560	807640	but there's still a hole in the bridge
807640	809720	that people are very curious about.
809720	811840	Oh, I thought that's what you meant got closed up.
811840	813280	No, the hole in the water.
813280	814120	Oh, okay.
814120	815100	The hole in the bridge is still there.
815100	815940	Yep. Gotcha.
815940	817560	That's the hole we're looking for, man.
817560	819400	That's the money hole.
819400	820600	That's the money hole.
822600	823440	Oh, boy.
823440	825000	Did you guys follow that at home?
826440	828800	Beck, get a good shot of this big money hole.
830320	831760	Big money, big money, big money.
831760	833700	I'm shooting the hole over the edge.
833700	836060	Yeah, I haven't described it this episode.
836060	838200	It is on the Beans Bridge,
838200	839640	which is the nearest bridge
839640	842620	from Cal Colorado's home through downtown.
842620	845600	And at the end of this bridge, nearest downtown,
845600	849240	there is a hole the size of a revolving door
849240	851920	from a shopping mall in the middle of this bridge.
851920	855440	And it is unnaturally smooth on the sides
855440	858320	where the hole has been ripped through this bridge.
858320	862560	Around this hole, there are countless city, county,
862560	866120	federal, state employees all coming around,
866120	868160	looking at it with their own different
868160	871720	sort of operational awarenesses and their own skills
871720	873760	and trying to figure out what happened here.
873760	878480	It is clearly a multi-agency task force.
878480	879680	Nailed it. Nice.
881280	883280	I'm getting some B-roll of the sides of the hole
883280	885120	because I think you mentioned they were smooth.
885120	889640	You were getting some of that B-roll.
889640	892380	And then at the end of our last episode,
892380	893880	the end of episode 18,
893880	897080	we saw Cal Colorado with a glint in his eye,
897080	900040	wink at the camera, move one of the barricades,
900040	905040	and make his way past onto the bridge and toward the hole.
905280	906360	Follow me Beckwith.
906360	908500	This is Cal Colorado City Action News,
908500	910760	and we're gonna get you the real story here tonight.
910760	912080	He B-lines it for,
912080	913800	you said there were like people in suits?
913800	915680	Yeah, there were people in suits.
915680	916520	Do they?
916520	918880	People in police officer uniforms,
918880	921080	people in like hazmat suits,
921080	923160	people in all sorts of different gear.
923160	925440	Who looks to be the most in charge?
925440	930440	Oh, there is a woman who is wearing a black suit
930920	933920	and people seem to be walking over to her
933920	936240	and keeping her abreast of the situation.
936240	938300	And she's kind of like on her phone
938300	940280	and talking to people and then pushing them off.
940280	942320	Keeping an eye on her for now,
942320	945200	Cal like looking into the camera, like gestures.
945200	946040	Come here, come here, come here.
946040	947520	And we go straight up to the hole.
947520	948880	Get this Beck, get this.
948880	949700	Look at this now.
949700	951160	Show the people what we've got here.
951160	953480	Let's go ahead and roll law.
954800	956800	Whichever one of you has the highest law.
956800	958660	And this is again at a negative 40.
958660	959840	I've got 40.
959840	961840	Oh, I've also got 40.
961840	962680	Did you crit?
962680	963500	No.
965800	967040	Me neither.
967040	967860	Nice.
967860	970700	Immediately upon you hitting the hole,
970700	973500	stepping up to it, a police officer walks over.
973500	974340	Get up.
975460	978180	It's just the Muppet, he can't hurt us.
978180	980500	Gentlemen, what are you doing?
980500	982460	Gentlemen, what are you up to this evening?
982460	984660	Cal Colorado officer, city action news.
984660	986740	And you see that line over there, about that there?
986740	987580	Of course, of course.
987580	988420	And he's pointing over at the barricade
988420	989380	where you just came from.
989380	990300	This is bigger than the line
990300	992500	that we're showing the people what's really going on here.
992500	993600	Get this Beck, get this.
993600	995540	Sir, would you consent to being interviewed
995540	996380	and telling us a little bit
996380	997340	about what's going on here tonight?
997340	1000340	Hands behind the back or bodies behind the barrier.
1000820	1001900	Okay, I understand.
1001900	1005460	We start backing away towards the people who are in charge.
1005460	1007940	Yes, we're heading back to the barrier, officer.
1007940	1008980	I understand, I understand.
1008980	1009980	Thank you very much.
1009980	1012660	You are absolutely going the wrong way there.
1012660	1015820	We're diagonally, our friends are over there
1015820	1017700	kind of towards the other side of the barrier that way.
1017700	1019620	So we are heading towards the barrier,
1019620	1021460	but diagonally in this kind of direction
1021460	1023100	that also sort of takes us through the center
1023100	1023940	of the rest of the things over here.
1023940	1026700	At this point, you're backing into the woman.
1026700	1028120	Cal Colorado, city action news.
1028120	1030100	I put the microphone in her face.
1030860	1031940	Get this, get this, get this.
1031940	1033380	She puts her hand up to the camera
1033380	1034620	and she's like, no, thank you.
1034620	1036840	Your laptop screen light actually makes it look
1036840	1038940	like you've got a camera light in your face.
1040120	1041020	Blocking it away.
1041020	1042140	No, thank you.
1042140	1043140	So sultry.
1043140	1044460	Yes, get away from me.
1047680	1049380	Cal did not say so sultry.
1049380	1053540	I was like, that was my comment on your vocal choice.
1053540	1055980	Well, in that case, Zach says, oh, hey, thanks.
1057620	1058460	Nice.
1058460	1059300	I'm playing him a little manic,
1059980	1061740	like how wild would it be if.
1061740	1065660	I mean, you're like, it's 4.30 in the morning
1065660	1067200	and it's bad.
1067200	1069100	Cal takes a huge fucking gamut
1069100	1071600	and he says, Cal Colorado, city action news.
1071600	1072440	Do you know me?
1072440	1073260	And he winks.
1073260	1075140	Yeah, roll charisma.
1075140	1076820	Negative 40.
1076820	1077640	That's a fail.
1079140	1081820	Would have actually passed 8,385, but.
1083300	1084620	I don't give a damn who you are.
1084620	1085980	Back up behind the border.
1085980	1088500	And the guy comes up behind you and he's like,
1088540	1089380	that's right.
1089380	1090200	I said, keep it moving.
1090200	1091040	Okay.
1091040	1092180	And it's got hands on you now.
1092180	1094340	He's like, what did I just say?
1094340	1095660	Can we get somebody else over here?
1095660	1097980	Hands behind her back or behind the barrier.
1097980	1098820	We got it.
1098820	1099660	We got it.
1099660	1100480	Cal failed your role.
1100480	1101320	Get the fuck out of here.
1101320	1102160	Yeah, I understand.
1102160	1103000	I understand.
1103000	1104940	Did the woman with the sultry voice
1104940	1106580	have any kind of identification on her?
1106580	1109220	Whether it's a name badge or something on her jacket.
1109220	1112500	Also, is she age appropriate to Cal Colorado?
1112500	1113340	Yes.
1113340	1116060	And she says, I don't give a fuck who you are.
1116100	1119580	And it's like a powerful peer of Cal Colorado's.
1119580	1120860	He's a little taken.
1120860	1123100	Is Beck taken too?
1123100	1123940	The sequel.
1125180	1129860	So you would notice that there is a tattoo on her hand,
1129860	1130940	the hand that she put up.
1130940	1131780	I zoom in on it.
1131780	1132940	To put in front of the camera.
1132940	1135700	And it is like the tail.
1135700	1138060	It's like a tail that's scaly.
1138060	1141180	That's running up out of her cuff.
1141180	1142780	Scaly like a rat tail?
1143660	1144500	No.
1144500	1145320	Like a dragon tail.
1145320	1147000	How close to a dragon than a rat?
1147000	1147840	A dragon rat.
1147840	1151440	And it just kind of creeps up out of the cuff
1151440	1153240	from under her suit jacket.
1153240	1156100	And I just realized she's wearing a suit.
1156100	1158220	And so as you back up,
1158220	1160680	what is Beck's reaction to this whole situation?
1160680	1161520	Oh yeah.
1161520	1162920	The whole time he's been walking through here,
1162920	1164460	he's been sweating bullets.
1164460	1165480	You've noticed that his eyes been
1165480	1166760	kind of darting back and forth.
1166760	1168520	And he's kind of been keeping his head down
1168520	1170280	like strictly into the viewfinder,
1170280	1171480	pointed directly at you.
1171480	1173240	And then when I bumped into her,
1173240	1175200	I was probably backing up and bumped into her
1176040	1177680	and saw her and I probably,
1177680	1179280	the camera jostled really bad.
1179280	1181100	And you saw me start to turn around
1181100	1183080	and walk toward the barricade like strongly.
1183080	1184440	And then remember, oh shit, I've got a job.
1184440	1186140	And I got, I'm pretty far away now
1186140	1188440	using a zoom to get you guys in frame.
1188440	1189880	As the officer approaches them,
1189880	1191600	he's like, I'm sorry officer, I'm sorry.
1191600	1193080	And he immediately turns away
1193080	1195840	and you kind of see like a sheepish boyish grin on his face.
1195840	1200840	And with the waters of the city river raging below you,
1201760	1206640	the sounds of the lapping waves hitting the rocks below.
1206640	1208120	The two of you kind of headed off
1208120	1210960	back on the other side of the barrier.
1210960	1213360	It's about 4.30 in the morning.
1213360	1217040	The haze of sunlight is kind of growing off in the distance,
1217040	1218640	even though it's still quite dark out.
1218640	1220800	So with all of my stats, negative 40,
1220800	1223580	I think Beck then is feeling that
1223580	1224800	and would just look at you
1224800	1228040	with just the most bloodshot and hang dog eyes.
1228040	1230720	I don't know if we're gonna be able to find anybody
1231560	1235000	tonight, like I'm about to just drop on the ground, man.
1235000	1235840	What do you mean?
1235840	1237600	Are you not, I mean, I'm so,
1237600	1239640	I'm taken up in the work right now.
1239640	1240460	What a day we've had.
1240460	1241680	We've got to go to the foundry.
1241680	1243760	We've got to have some drinks at the foundry.
1243760	1245080	I'm buying.
1245080	1245920	Come on.
1245920	1247620	Cal, I can't do it, Cal.
1247620	1250480	Well, you want to go back to your mom's sad apartment?
1250480	1252160	I was gonna ask if I could crash at your place,
1252160	1253520	but it sounds like you're still going out.
1253520	1254760	So I'll just sleep in the van
1254760	1256080	and I'll meet you in the morning.
1256080	1256920	I'll be right in front.
1256920	1257740	Okay, no, no, no.
1257740	1259080	We'll go have drinks at my place.
1259080	1260200	We'll have some drinks at my place.
1260600	1262280	Come on, let's go back to my place.
1262280	1264800	Yeah, yeah, we'll go back to your place and then.
1264800	1266160	It's just like hanging out with Thomas.
1266160	1267000	Go to sleep.
1270240	1272680	Hey, I was trying to explore that subtly
1272680	1274120	through character work.
1276000	1278920	I was trying to exaggerate it, but I guess, I don't know.
1278920	1279760	I liked it.
1279760	1282100	If it was me, I'm ready to go to the foundry.
1283760	1287040	I know, but other people aren't.
1288240	1289200	Something I've learned
1289200	1291000	and I'm trying to express through my character,
1291000	1295080	Cal, Colorado, who hasn't learned it.
1298500	1300600	What are you guys doing after this, by the way?
1302360	1304140	But yeah, I said I'm going back.
1304140	1305400	Yeah, we get back there.
1305400	1307480	All right, I'm just gonna crash in the van
1307480	1309000	and I'll see you in the morning, man.
1309000	1310600	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Beck, Beck, Beck.
1310600	1311440	I insist.
1311440	1313420	I've got seven bedrooms in this home.
1313420	1314440	You will take one.
1314440	1316120	Yeah, okay.
1316120	1318000	I mean, if you're talking about sleeping, yeah.
1318000	1320400	I am, and Stevie's gonna come back.
1320400	1322320	I mean, well, you know, we're gonna probably,
1322320	1324680	I've got some pretty nice whiskey.
1324680	1327080	Hey, do you, speaking of her coming back,
1327080	1328880	do you have security cameras?
1328880	1331360	Like A, could we see when they left?
1331360	1334060	And B, like get a notification if they come back?
1334060	1336640	I get all these notifications from the Ring app
1336640	1338440	and I don't know what to do with them.
1338440	1340960	I, maybe you can find something relevant in here.
1340960	1343920	Let me see that, let me see that.
1343920	1345940	I'm looking at the hours after we left
1345940	1347680	and seeing if we get any footage of them leaving.
1348240	1350760	Did you see Stevie and God come and go like seven times
1350760	1352840	like they go to the fucking bodega.
1352840	1353840	They are holding pizza.
1353840	1354680	Yeah.
1356800	1359320	Arms full of snackies.
1359320	1361160	They walk away the first time, they come back,
1361160	1366160	they walk away with $1,500 in their arms in cash.
1366400	1367680	They come back with pizza.
1369200	1371600	A little too many, like feed too many red peppers
1371600	1373220	and God goes crazy.
1374180	1377780	The app wasn't downloaded on Cal's phone.
1377780	1380420	Like it had been long enough that he'd clicked on it,
1380420	1381900	that it wasn't downloaded.
1381900	1383500	So you click download on it
1383500	1386900	and as it's finishing up the, oh man, you're asleep.
1389300	1392460	I see Beck just like passed out on the couch with my phone
1392460	1394340	and I like pluck it out of his hands,
1394340	1395780	like plug it in a charger,
1395780	1397980	walk off with the two glasses of whiskey
1397980	1399840	I've just poured for me and Beck.
1399840	1403800	I throw one down my gullet and walk upstairs to my bedroom,
1403800	1406680	pass dozens of pictures of Cal's career
1406680	1409100	from the seventies on to today.
1409100	1412120	And he downs the second glass, brushes his teeth,
1412120	1414000	gets in like some silk pajamas
1414000	1417480	and slips into a pretty fucking nice bed set.
1417480	1418880	This sounds lovely.
1418880	1421720	I'm warm and soft.
1421720	1423320	Just in case either one of you are wondering.
1423320	1426380	Yeah, we know, you're a soft little bitch.
1430840	1431840	Now I'm hard.
1435680	1437520	What was that?
1437520	1438520	You're broken.
1438520	1439520	You said broken.
1439520	1440520	You're broken.
1447520	1450520	I broke and I couldn't breathe.
1450520	1452520	Can that man not breathe every time he laughs?
1452520	1454520	He's like a human bug.
1455520	1456520	Oh my God.
1461520	1462520	You had wake apnea.
1475520	1476520	Oh man.
1476520	1478520	Okay, cool.
1478520	1480520	We dropped so many balls today, man.
1481520	1484520	I was like, I can't see a way in character
1484520	1487520	to get Vivica from just stop her from walking away from here.
1487520	1490520	We didn't really try that hard to go find Stevie and God.
1490520	1493520	I mean, like I said, mechanically and what,
1493520	1495520	because of mechanically what Beck would be feeling,
1495520	1496520	he just wouldn't be able to.
1496520	1497520	He just couldn't.
1497520	1500520	I feel like we could have deployed some energy drink.
1500520	1502520	Yeah, I mean, I had it coursing through my veins.
1502520	1505520	I figured that had already been taken into account.
1505520	1507520	Energy drink coursing through my veins.
1507520	1509520	Energy drink coursing through my veins.
1509520	1512520	Yeah, I think just with the day that you guys have all had
1512520	1514520	hitting that 5 a.m. spot,
1514520	1516520	I was just going to be like, nah.
1516520	1518520	What are we at on recording time?
1518520	1519520	Nothing.
1519520	1521520	I have not clicked record yet.
1521520	1522520	Cool.
1522520	1524520	I think we can really nail it in the second take
1524520	1526520	and lose all that mindless bullshit.
1529520	1532520	Now we're going to double down on the soft bitch stuff.
1532520	1533520	Go back, go back.
1533520	1536520	Find anything that really cut anybody deep.
1537520	1538520	Double down.
1538520	1539520	Double down.
1539520	1540520	Double down.
1540520	1541520	Should we bring Luke in?
1541520	1542520	Yeah, let's get Luke back.
1542520	1543520	So he doesn't...
1543520	1544520	Luke!
1544520	1545520	We got Luke a boy.
1545520	1546520	I'm back.
1546520	1547520	They sent me outside.
1547520	1548520	How was it?
1548520	1549520	I watched TikTok videos.
1549520	1550520	Yeah?
1550520	1551520	It was nice.
1551520	1552520	Did you have a good time?
1552520	1553520	Yeah, but I'm glad to be back.
1553520	1554520	Yeah, back in the hospital.
1554520	1555520	Beep.
1555520	1556520	Beep.
1556520	1557520	Beep.
1557520	1559520	Oh, thank God he's alive and the camera zooms in
1559520	1562520	and sees that Julius Summers is out cold.
1562520	1564520	I'm just kidding.
1564520	1565520	Do whatever you want.
1565520	1567520	It's zoomed in on the monitor, the heart monitor,
1567520	1571520	and it's going beep, beep, beep.
1571520	1573520	Boop.
1573520	1575520	And then it pans over to Julius,
1575520	1579520	who has come to from his not very restful night of sleep,
1579520	1580520	and he's got to pee.
1580520	1581520	So he's disconnecting that shit.
1581520	1583520	Okay, it's disconnected.
1583520	1585520	That's not what happens when you have to pee.
1585520	1586520	My heart stops and I have to pee.
1586520	1589520	Right, it's just disconnected because he's got to go pee.
1589520	1591520	Go ahead and roll a con times five for me
1591520	1595520	and that'll see whether you get your natural healing
1595520	1600520	of one hit point back for the eve.
1600520	1601520	37 on a 50.
1601520	1602520	Nice.
1602520	1604520	So take one more hit point of health.
1604520	1605520	And what does that bring you up to?
1605520	1606520	Seven?
1606520	1607520	Six.
1607520	1608520	Six?
1608520	1609520	Lovely.
1609520	1611520	Nurse comes in, puts your TV on,
1611520	1615520	and you see the same thing that Kurt showed you,
1615520	1616520	but it's all over the news.
1616520	1619520	And there's footage from all sorts of different angles,
1619520	1622520	but you do think that Kurt's footage might be the best
1622520	1624520	of anything that you're seeing flash before your eyes
1624520	1626520	on cable news here?
1626520	1627520	Did it break on can?
1627520	1628520	Hard to remember.
1628520	1630520	Don't really care.
1630520	1631520	How does it make you feel?
1631520	1632520	Scared.
1632520	1633520	But you're okay.
1633520	1634520	You can handle it?
1634520	1635520	This?
1635520	1636520	This.
1636520	1638520	It's some sort of weather tornado they're saying.
1638520	1640520	Tornado lightning.
1640520	1641520	That's what they're saying?
1641520	1642520	Yeah.
1642520	1643520	Keep believing that.
1643520	1644520	I've got to pee.
1644520	1645520	That's what I'm here to help with.
1645520	1647520	I can handle it.
1647520	1650520	I can handle it too.
1650520	1653520	Julius doesn't like this nurse and then looks to see,
1653520	1654520	does she have a badge on?
1654520	1656520	No, she doesn't work here.
1656520	1659520	It's just some wild person roaming the halls.
1659520	1663520	I hit the call a nurse button and then go pee real quick.
1663520	1665520	And I get back in bed and wait for the nurse.
1665520	1667520	When the nurse comes in, he's like, what's up?
1667520	1671520	There's some lady roaming the halls trying to scare people.
1671520	1672520	Did you see this?
1672520	1674520	And he points up at the TV.
1674520	1676520	Oh, yeah, what's going to happen next?
1676520	1677520	Global warming, right?
1677520	1678520	Right.
1678520	1680520	So you think it's weather?
1680520	1682520	Yeah, lightning tornado, is that what they're calling it?
1682520	1683520	Yeah.
1683520	1687520	So watch the evening news tonight, just so you know.
1687520	1689520	Anyway, how am I doing here?
1689520	1692520	Yeah, I mean, everything looks fine.
1692520	1696520	You're going to be in pain for four to six weeks at least.
1696520	1698520	You're going to want to stay on the medicine for,
1698520	1701520	hopefully not too long, but you got to take it when you need it.
1701520	1702520	Don't be a hero.
1702520	1705520	You'll have some serious pain in the face for a while.
1705520	1707520	Yeah, I know what you mean.
1707520	1710520	But yeah, besides that, you should be fine.
1710520	1712520	No severe broken tissue.
1712520	1714520	You're going to look the same after a while.
1714520	1717520	Thank you very much, and would like to be discharged, please.
1717520	1718520	Do you need a wheelchair?
1718520	1724520	Julius wants to send the nurse out while he gets dressed in his clothes and stuff.
1724520	1725520	Sure.
1725520	1728520	But he also wants to search around for any sharp objects in the room.
1728520	1731520	Oh, they don't like to keep those around in hospital rooms typically.
1731520	1734520	Yeah, but how good are the doctors here?
1734520	1736520	Not that great apparently.
1736520	1737520	So what are you looking for?
1737520	1740520	Something to maybe try to cut part of my face off.
1740520	1742520	Oh my God, dude. Fuck.
1742520	1746520	Because the pee didn't take that long, but Julius staring into the mirror in the bathroom,
1746520	1748520	that was like a solid 10 minutes.
1748520	1753520	Roll luck 50-50.
1753520	1756520	You roll under 50, you find something sharp.
1757520	1759520	Although I guess it should be the other way around.
1759520	1760520	I rolled under 50.
1760520	1761520	Okay.
1761520	1767520	Yeah, you see there is a pair of shears, a pair of scissors that is in one of the cabinet drawers.
1767520	1772520	And it's the kind with the plastic grip. It's not super sharp scissors.
1772520	1776520	Julius figures this is probably the best place to do this.
1776520	1781520	And he's going to go in the bathroom and try to poke the scissors right at his jaw.
1781520	1782520	Yeah.
1782520	1784520	And poke them through and try to cut.
1784520	1787520	He's not going to go full face, but he's going to see at least,
1787520	1791520	he's pretty sure underneath is like what he's actually supposed to be.
1791520	1794520	So he's just going to remove that first fake layer.
1794520	1795520	How much?
1795520	1797520	Like the right cheek.
1797520	1798520	The whole right cheek?
1798520	1799520	Yeah.
1799520	1800520	Oh my God.
1800520	1802520	Okay, roll grip to go through with this.
1802520	1806520	I guess he doesn't have to poke through. He can just start at the corner of his mouth.
1806520	1811520	I'm going to make you roll grip to see if you can follow through with this. This is disgusting.
1811520	1813520	21 out of 25.
1813520	1816520	Oh, yeah. No, you're not going to be able to do this.
1816520	1818520	Oh, because I passed.
1818520	1819520	Yeah, you passed.
1819520	1825520	As one half of the scissors is in my mouth and the other half is on the outside of my cheek,
1825520	1827520	I'm about to cut through.
1827520	1829520	Nurse walks in and says, oh.
1829520	1835520	Julius kind of like snaps and like shakes his head and just lets the nurse take the scissors.
1835520	1838520	And thank you. I guess I'll go.
1838520	1842520	And Julius wants to just kind of like go past the nurse and try to leave the hospital.
1842520	1849520	He fucking crit failed his grip check seeing you do that and just stands there, frozen,
1849520	1853520	staring at the most awful, confusing thing he's seen.
1853520	1855520	I mean, he just, you shininged him.
1855520	1862520	He like walked past the door and saw you in there with the scissors inside of your like skin and mouth.
1862520	1867520	Like you were putting butter underneath the chicken skin on fucking Thanksgiving.
1867520	1869520	Is he like completely blocking the doorway?
1869520	1871520	No, no, no, no. You just walk right past him.
1871520	1873520	Yeah, I just kind of squeeze around him.
1873520	1876520	I pat him on the back and say, thanks.
1876520	1877520	And I look at his badge.
1877520	1878520	Darren.
1878520	1880520	Thanks, Darren. Thank you. Bye.
1880520	1885520	And I'm going to start heading towards the exit of the hospital and give Cal a call.
1885520	1887520	Yeah, absolutely.
1887520	1888520	And we'll bring those two back.
1888520	1890520	Bird, bird time.
1890520	1892520	As I'm leaving the hospital, I call Cal.
1892520	1897520	Yeah, let's get a little early morning pickup here from the Colorado home.
1897520	1898520	Yeah, you were in for a while.
1898520	1900520	You had a full rest.
1900520	1903520	I was watching the noon o'clock news, right?
1903520	1904520	Yeah.
1904520	1906520	So we're talking noon thirty.
1906520	1907520	Oh, God.
1911520	1915520	Oh, hello. Hello. Cal, Colorado. Good afternoon.
1915520	1918520	Hey, Cal, it's Julius. I just got out of the hospital.
1918520	1920520	Julius Summers. How are you?
1920520	1924520	Well, they discharged me from the hospital and a clean bill of health.
1924520	1928520	I guess I wouldn't really go back to that hospital if I had the choice.
1928520	1929520	Oh, which hospital?
1929520	1932520	It was St. Luke's Children's Hospital.
1932520	1935520	Well, now I've had several fine procedures at St. Luke's.
1935520	1938520	The procedures they gave me were all too small.
1940520	1945520	I'm sorry, I just woke up. I don't understand at all what you mean.
1945520	1947520	Well, where should I go?
1947520	1948520	Luke, what are your max hit points?
1948520	1950520	Max is ten.
1950520	1953520	Perfect. On a scale of one to ten, how would you say you feel?
1953520	1956520	Oh, like twenty percent better.
1956520	1958520	I'm sixty right now.
1958520	1962520	Okay. Well, you know, we all had a rough night. I feel like I'm about a sixty-two.
1962520	1965520	Curious. Cal and Beck, are the two of you down any hit points?
1965520	1966520	Oh, yeah.
1966520	1973520	Okay, so you can actually roll a constitution check to regain a hit point of natural healing with overnight sleep.
1973520	1976520	I don't have Cal as having lost any hit points.
1976520	1977520	That makes sense to me.
1977520	1978520	I did not pass my con check.
1978520	1979520	Bummer.
1979520	1980520	Bummer.
1980520	1984520	He slept on the shitty basement couch where God was supposed to be.
1984520	1986520	That's unsettling.
1986520	1991520	God fucked it up in the escape, so it's all... your back is just, like, shitty this morning.
1991520	1995520	Should I come over or go to work? What happened?
1995520	1998520	Wow, Julius, I'm still kind of coming around here.
1998520	2007520	Why don't you head over, I'll put some coffee on, and we'll all discuss our next steps around the dinner table. How does that sound?
2007520	2008520	Great, I'll jog over.
2008520	2009520	He's got to exercise.
2009520	2010520	Yeah, that's close.
2010520	2013520	Beck, what's the wake up situation?
2013520	2016520	I wouldn't wake up unless you did something to wake me up.
2016520	2020520	Oh, yeah, remember the intro scene to Beck Wilder.
2020520	2027520	Face down, tighty whities up, that's the way he likes to sleep in.
2027520	2035520	Cal doesn't do anything in particular, but he is loudly whistling, and at a few points, like, definitely running from room to room as he grabs different things,
2035520	2042520	and he's kind of excited and preparing, like, yeah, we're going to have coffee and then we're going to plan our Pulitzer Day, part two.
2042520	2050520	So, yeah, you would hear him running up and down stairs and stuff, and he's a big enough guy that it's booming through the house.
2050520	2052520	You hear one stir from the couch.
2052520	2058520	No, mom, I don't want to walk a dog. It's not my dog.
2058520	2059520	Oh!
2059520	2067520	You hear the, like, the basement door creak open, and Cal peeks his head and he says, Beck, Beck, good morning.
2067520	2070520	Coffee's on in five. Get on up here.
2070520	2071520	Get on up here.
2071520	2073520	Yeah, okay, I'll be right up.
2073520	2075520	We've got to find Stevie and God.
2075520	2076520	Yeah, big day.
2076520	2077520	Julius is coming over.
2077520	2078520	Is he all right?
2078520	2080520	Oh, uh, 60 percent?
2080520	2081520	All right, good enough.
2081520	2082520	That's what I said.
2082520	2083520	All right, I'll be up in a sec.
2083520	2085520	Nothing some coffee can't fix.
2085520	2088520	Julius opens the front door, a little sweaty.
2088520	2092520	Who the fuck is that?
2092520	2093520	Got any water?
2093520	2097520	Oh, he's got some very well-made lattes, each with a little, like, news van in it.
2097520	2099520	He's like, oh, yeah, yeah.
2099520	2100520	Those are great.
2100520	2101520	You can have some water.
2101520	2105520	Julius takes one and then sips it and has a little milk froth mustache.
2105520	2107520	I saw the news broke. I saw God on TV.
2107520	2109520	Cal drops the tray.
2109520	2111520	What do you mean our news broke?
2111520	2117520	I turn it to can on his TV, and magically that is on.
2117520	2118520	You can do magic?
2118520	2119520	That story is...
2119520	2121520	I turn the TV on and it's like they're interested.
2121520	2124520	You turn the TV on and it's in Cal, Colorado's house, so it's on can.
2124520	2128520	And can is currently covering this exclusively.
2128520	2133520	They're just about to intro the whole story on can, so it's perfect timing.
2133520	2136520	Becca's walking up now, up to the back of the couch, into frame.
2136520	2139520	They're running. What are they running? They're running.
2139520	2140520	Is it ours?
2140520	2143520	It's Daddy's. Kurt's. Kurt's footage.
2143520	2146520	Okay, with our pickup from last night?
2146520	2147520	Would you have been able to send that in?
2147520	2149520	Yeah, we sent that in, Link.
2149520	2150520	I think you have to take it to the station.
2150520	2154520	The rules of the universe, as we've established, seems like we would have to take it.
2154520	2161520	I figured we'd run it as an evening news segment, but that was breaking news because people know about it.
2161520	2167520	People saw it, as far as the logistics of Julius' thoughts went.
2167520	2171520	When Kurt's footage ends, you see the can studio.
2171520	2179520	Isabella Kaya back with this absolutely staggering story here on City Action News.
2179520	2185520	I mean, for those of us watching at home who have never seen Lightning Tornado before,
2185520	2193520	it can be scary, but I'm being told from those scientists who we love listening to here at can
2193520	2197520	that there is absolutely nothing to be afraid of.
2197520	2199520	Isabella Kaya, City Action News.
2199520	2202520	Kaya was like, didn't they see our footage?
2202520	2207520	It's not a lightning tornado, it's God! That's God, you idiots!
2207520	2211520	Everybody at the hospital just thought it was a lightning tornado.
2211520	2213520	That's stupid!
2213520	2214520	It's what they're telling him.
2214520	2219520	Wait, maybe we could spin this as a positive. Now we'll be able to answer all the questions.
2219520	2226520	Instinctively, Beckwilder reaches his hand in his pocket for the thumb drive that he copied all the footage onto,
2226520	2229520	and he flashbacks to the moment that Vivica-
2229520	2231520	Put that kick me sign on me.
2231520	2233520	Put that kick me sign on you.
2233520	2234520	She stole it.
2234520	2238520	And you reach the bottom of your pocket and your heart sinks.
2238520	2240520	Beck, what's wrong?
2240520	2245520	You're right, Beck. We can just say teasers that's like the crazy tornado that happened.
2245520	2248520	We'll just tune into can and we'll tell you what it's all about.
2248520	2249520	Beck, what's wrong?
2249520	2251520	Let's get that footage over to the station.
2251520	2252520	Look at his face, Julius.
2252520	2257520	Yeah, the footage, it's on the thumb drive. Remember the thumb drive?
2257520	2258520	Yeah.
2258520	2263520	And I put it into this pocket and that pocket is empty.
2263520	2265520	Check your other pocket.
2265520	2268520	Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I check another pocket, and I check another pocket.
2268520	2269520	Check.
2269520	2271520	And I check another pocket, and I check another pocket.
2271520	2272520	Your coat.
2272520	2274520	And I check another pocket.
2274520	2277520	Check the fucking camera, Beck. Check the can van.
2277520	2281520	Yeah, Vivian took the drive. She had to have.
2281520	2282520	Vivica, she had to have.
2282520	2284520	When would Vivica have taken the drive?
2284520	2287520	When she put that hilarious sign on his back.
2287520	2289520	Oh, we've got to find Vivica.
2289520	2292520	We've got to find Vivica, we've got to find Stevie, we've got to find our footage.
2292520	2295520	All we have is your TikToks, Julius.
2295520	2299520	Julius, like, kind of perks up and then goes to post another TikTok.
2299520	2301520	I posted the Jackalope one yesterday.
2301520	2302520	Yep.
2302520	2303520	Guys, which one should I do?
2303520	2305520	I don't know what you have.
2305520	2308520	Didn't we have footage of the medical device, maybe? Was that something?
2308520	2311520	Yeah, I'll do that, of them healing up your wound.
2311520	2312520	Yeah.
2312520	2313520	He posts that.
2313520	2314520	Do that.
2314520	2317520	And while it's doing it, he puts, like, the sound that would be in a St. Jude's commercial,
2317520	2321520	he puts that in the background as the sound and uploads it.
2324520	2325520	Good edit.
2326520	2328520	We've got to find Vivica.
2328520	2330520	We've got to find Stevie and God.
2330520	2334520	We've got to find out what the fuck is going on at Cannes and where our footage is.
2334520	2335520	I'm going to call Cannes.
2335520	2337520	Bec, do you feel comfortable?
2337520	2339520	Can you hunt down Vivica?
2339520	2340520	Yeah.
2340520	2341520	Do you know her?
2341520	2343520	Of course. I've got to get my footage back, dude.
2343520	2344520	You don't think she got rid of it, right?
2344520	2347520	Julius, can you get a hold of your uncle or go to his home?
2347520	2348520	I call Tyfe.
2348520	2349520	Boing, boing.
2349520	2350520	Boing, boing.
2351520	2352520	Boing, boing.
2352520	2353520	Boing, boing.
2353520	2355520	Julius.
2356520	2357520	Uncle.
2357520	2358520	My guy.
2358520	2359520	Uncle Tyfe.
2359520	2360520	We've got good news.
2360520	2361520	Yeah? Well, I am, like-
2361520	2363520	Well, and bad news.
2363520	2364520	Tell him we've got questions.
2364520	2366520	What are you doing? Why weren't you answering my calls yesterday?
2366520	2369520	I'm fucking hungry for good news.
2369520	2372520	You're going to give me some good news? I love that.
2372520	2375520	We've got crazy footage, but we lost it.
2375520	2378520	Well, like I said, we hungry.
2378520	2380520	All right, tell me about this footage.
2380520	2382520	Grover's Gorge. Have you heard of it?
2382520	2385520	Forget about it. Cut. What are you talking about?
2385520	2389520	We followed that anonymous tip and it led us to Grover's Gorge,
2389520	2392520	which is a hidden utopia that's ran by the-
2392520	2393520	Dystopia.
2393520	2394520	The Godel company.
2394520	2395520	It's a utopia?
2395520	2397520	It's run by the Godel company?
2397520	2398520	That's amazing.
2398520	2399520	It's nice, but it's bad.
2399520	2401520	It was an anonymous tip? What was it?
2401520	2403520	It was just a pin in the middle of nowhere.
2403520	2405520	Just a pin? Who was assigning all the-
2405520	2408520	I mean, I assume it was Isabella who assigned you all the stories?
2408520	2410520	She did a bang up job. She's good.
2410520	2412520	She's all right. She's the best.
2412520	2414520	Well, we've got to find Vivica. Are you at work?
2414520	2416520	Yeah, I'm in the office.
2416520	2417520	Is Vivica there?
2417520	2418520	I don't know. I'm upstairs.
2418520	2420520	Can you check?
2420520	2421520	Let me slack her real quick.
2421520	2423520	Oh, it says she's working from home.
2423520	2424520	Did you-
2424520	2427520	I get on the slack channel and add Vivica?
2427520	2429520	What's up?
2429520	2431520	Oh, no buy? No buy for your uncle?
2431520	2434520	I am doing that with him still on the phone.
2434520	2435520	Uncle type, yeah.
2435520	2439520	When I talk to Vivica, we'll bring you the footage and show it to you, but it's big.
2439520	2443520	Well, if it makes the Godel company look great, that's fantastic, you know?
2443520	2445520	They were really haranguing us about that last story.
2445520	2448520	It got crazy there, but you know, this is going to be great.
2448520	2449520	Good job, Julius.
2449520	2453520	Oh, you're going to be on top so soon if you keep it up like this, my guy.
2453520	2454520	Are you working all week?
2454520	2456520	You're taking a vacation this week, right?
2456520	2457520	What?
2457520	2458520	I thought you told me.
2458520	2459520	You're taking the week off.
2459520	2460520	No, just a day.
2460520	2461520	Just a day.
2461520	2463520	Had a meeting down at the city, city tower.
2463520	2465520	Well, you sound like you could get some rest.
2465520	2467520	Whoa, is that a burn?
2467520	2468520	Is that a sick burn?
2468520	2469520	Did I get got?
2469520	2470520	I don't know.
2470520	2471520	I'll talk to you later.
2471520	2472520	I've got to find Vivica.
2472520	2473520	Bye.
2473520	2474520	Beep.
2474520	2476520	I couldn't help but hear like some of that over the receiver.
2476520	2479520	Guys, we can't show my uncle the footage.
2479520	2484520	He said as long as it makes the Godel company look good, then he'll be happy.
2484520	2485520	We can't show it to him.
2485520	2487520	We've got to find a way to run it without it going past him.
2487520	2490520	He said only good news for the Godel...
2490520	2491520	Fuck.
2491520	2492520	He said...
2492520	2493520	He threatened you?
2493520	2496520	He said only good news for the Godel company.
2496520	2497520	I mean, he didn't threaten me, but...
2497520	2498520	He threatened the truth.
2498520	2499520	He threatened the news.
2499520	2500520	Basically, yeah.
2500520	2503520	I mean, has my uncle always been like this?
2503520	2504520	Not in my experience.
2504520	2507520	Julius, I haven't felt like this since 1983.
2507520	2508520	What happened in 1983?
2508520	2513520	That was a personal matter.
2513520	2516520	But it is the closest to truth and justice I've ever truly come.
2516520	2522520	And you see a flashback to Cal spending a summer following his brother around
2522520	2529520	and catching him in this elaborate lie about a Christmas gift.
2529520	2532520	Beck, do you know where Vivica lives?
2532520	2534520	You've worked with her closely for so long.
2534520	2537520	Yeah, I know the neighborhood.
2537520	2540520	I dropped her off two or three times over the years.
2540520	2541520	I think I could find it.
2541520	2542520	Roll intelligence.
2542520	2545520	Oh my God, it's a 70 on a 70.
2545520	2546520	Yeah.
2546520	2547520	Ooh!
2547520	2548520	Our smiles.
2548520	2549520	Good boy.
2549520	2551520	Yeah, I know exactly.
2551520	2552520	I could take you right there.
2552520	2553520	Yeah.
2553520	2554520	Totally, dude.
2554520	2556520	I think we've got to go get this shit from Vivica.
2556520	2557520	We've got to get our fucking footage.
2557520	2559520	We've got to get the footage.
2559520	2560520	Vivica has our Pulitzer.
2560520	2566520	I didn't go through all of that shit just to get the footage stolen by some fucking
2566520	2567520	editor.
2567520	2570520	Vivica's good, though.
2570520	2571520	Vivica's good, though.
2571520	2575520	Maybe she just is doing touch-ups at home and forgot to-
2575520	2577520	You saw her face yesterday, Beck.
2577520	2579520	She's not just doing touch-ups.
2579520	2580520	That footage is in danger.
2580520	2581520	We've got to get to her, guys.
2581520	2585520	Vivica taught us an important lesson, which is that this footage is more powerful than
2585520	2586520	even we suspected.
2586520	2590520	We know we've got something here, but we need to be a little more careful with it,
2590520	2592520	and to that end, we have to secure it immediately.
2592520	2595520	Guys, we've got to get this footage from Vivica.
2595520	2601520	Vivica, if the news is like music, these pieces are The Beatles.
2601520	2602520	That's what I've always said, dude.
2602520	2603520	Yeah.
2603520	2606520	The Beatles were very popular when I was a schoolboy, and-
2606520	2607520	They're still popular.
2607520	2613520	I just want to say I resented them at the time, but I do understand their appeal.
2613520	2615520	Let's go, boys.
2615520	2618520	I met them once.
2618520	2620520	You can tell us about it on the way there, Cal.
2620520	2623520	I figure that's what he says as we're walking out the door.
2623520	2624520	Cal, you never told me.
2624520	2626520	You met the fucking Beatles, dude?
2626520	2628520	That's the coolest fucking shit I've ever heard.
2628520	2633520	As we're walking out, Cal points to several pictures, like three pictures with the Beatles
2633520	2639520	at different stages of their career when he's a kid, and then finally in their 70s crazy
2639520	2645520	phase, one is him as a teenager reporter, and then multiple pictures of him with John
2645520	2653520	Lennon up to a point, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and he shows you some extensive
2653520	2658520	correspondence with Ringo.
2658520	2660520	You got this last one in under the wire.
2660520	2664520	He stopped taking mail, famously stopped taking mail recently.
2664520	2666520	Not for friends.
2666520	2668520	Nice.
2668520	2671520	We play chess by mail.
2671520	2675520	Across the pond, it takes forever.
2675520	2676520	Why are we wasting time?
2676520	2677520	Get in the van.
2677520	2680520	Get in the van.
2680520	2681520	No, wait.
2682520	2683520	Who else?
2683520	2687520	Beck, you've never shown any interest in my pictures before now.
2687520	2690520	I had never noticed that that was George Harrison there that you're sitting on the bench with.
2690520	2692520	Who else haunts these halls?
2692520	2693520	I'm kidding.
2693520	2695520	I figured this was happening in the van.
2695520	2697520	Definitely happening in the van.
2697520	2698520	Is it that one?
2698520	2700520	There it is right there.
2700520	2703520	The van is lined with pictures too.
2703520	2705520	Some of the choicer ones.
2705520	2708520	Vivica has a pretty cool place above a bodega on the corner.
2708520	2710520	A bodega?
2711520	2715520	I thought you said bodega, which would be really fun.
2715520	2718520	She lives above a place called Bodega.
2720520	2723520	They sell bidets and bagels.
2723520	2725520	Bodega.
2725520	2729520	The sign has the water shooting through a doughnut, a bagel hole.
2732520	2739520	It is also just a standard bodega with a cat, but it's also bodega.
2740520	2742520	It's bodega.
2742520	2744520	No, it's clearly not.
2747520	2750520	Julius really wants to stop in, but knows that there's no time.
2750520	2753520	Yeah, and her door is just off to the side.
2753520	2758520	Beck, you would know that when you open up the door, it just immediately stares on the other side,
2758520	2762520	so you'd have to buzz up, but the last time you were here, the buzzer didn't work.
2762520	2765520	Now I'm just picturing your old apartment.
2766520	2768520	They have to run down and meet us?
2768520	2769520	Well, we hit the buzzer.
2770520	2773520	It is July 6th. It's about 1pm.
2773520	2776520	It's a hot day. The sun is shining down.
2776520	2780520	It's a Wednesday. Less kids on the street than usual, and the ones that you do see, you're like,
2780520	2781520	It's Wednesday.
2781520	2782520	There's the urchins.
2782520	2787520	Cal remembers, and it's weird that he and Beck didn't remember before now,
2787520	2791520	but he remembers that they successfully downloaded the Ring app,
2791520	2793520	and that it'll have all the footage from last night.
2793520	2795520	Oh yeah.
2795520	2796520	Oh yeah.
2796520	2801520	Hold on, boys. Before we go in, let's take a moment to watch what came in and out of the front door last night.
2801520	2802520	Of here?
2802520	2806520	No, of my place. Remember how God and Stevie escaped?
2806520	2808520	Yeah, you guys haven't talked about that much.
2808520	2813520	Well, you know, we went to the bridge last night, and then we slept in, and it was at a chance since then.
2813520	2820520	Yeah, I mean, I figured when I saw Kurt's footage that, I mean, I knew that Stevie and God weren't gonna be at your apartment anymore.
2820520	2821520	So what, did you find anything?
2821520	2823520	God is everywhere, Julius.
2823520	2825520	Did you find anything?
2825520	2830520	We found evidence that Stevie may have let Fox out of his bindings.
2830520	2837520	And so we went and just, like, did a cursory check at the bridge, but we were both beat, so we didn't get much there.
2837520	2841520	But then I realized that maybe Cal has security cameras, and sure enough, he does.
2841520	2844520	So I downloaded the app last night, and I didn't get a chance to look at it.
2844520	2846520	Let's watch it.
2846520	2847520	That is a wild sound.
2847520	2850520	Yeah, there's a bunch of owls going crazy outside.
2850520	2851520	Is that what that is?
2851520	2853520	Yeah, take your headphone out.
2856520	2861520	They're like, shut up, Zach's listening now.
2861520	2863520	I thought somebody's, like, phone or something.
2863520	2865520	Yeah, I thought it was his phone.
2865520	2866520	That was nuts.
2866520	2867520	What were we doing? Oh, yeah.
2867520	2868520	The app.
2868520	2869520	The app, I downloaded the app.
2869520	2870520	Yeah, the Ring app.
2870520	2872520	Let's see what happened.
2872520	2874520	For just $4.99 a month, you can subscribe to Ring.
2874520	2876520	In grainy black and white.
2876520	2878520	Get the premium.
2878520	2881520	No, it's a Ring camera, it's not grainy black and white for sure.
2881520	2883520	Oh, but it's nighttime.
2883520	2886520	It's a Ring camera, which is a high quality camera.
2886520	2887520	Yeah, but it's nighttime.
2887520	2891520	It's the only camera I would buy to secure my house.
2891520	2893520	Where can you pick one up?
2893520	2896520	Amazon is where I got mine. You can get them directly from Ring.com.
2896520	2899520	We're not allowed to have separate deals, you rat.
2901520	2903520	So what do we see in, like, the...
2903520	2906520	So hit those show notes for a link to the Ring camera.
2906520	2907520	They're both in on it.
2907520	2908520	Available at Target.
2908520	2909520	Thank you.
2909520	2912520	We see high quality black and white.
2912520	2913520	Yeah, because it's nighttime.
2913520	2915520	Yeah, but it's high quality, it's not grainy.
2915520	2917520	Because it's Ring camera at Ring.com.
2925520	2929520	While Beck is pulling up the footage, I'm ordering a bedagel.
2930520	2932520	Wow, that app looks so user friendly.
2934520	2936520	With just a few simple tabs, I can see who's at the front door.
2936520	2937520	Let's tab away.
2937520	2940520	Yes, one plain bagel please and one everything bidet.
2942520	2952520	Suddenly, you see Stevie walk out the front door, followed by Greg Godle.
2952520	2957520	She holds the door open as Greg passes her and heads down to the front yard.
2957520	2961520	Stevie closes the door, notices the Ring camera.
2961520	2962520	Oh.
2962520	2963520	Everyone roll humit.
2963520	2966520	I thought she was here and I was like, I don't know why she's here, but I'm excited.
2966520	2968520	Oh my god, that's why you were waving?
2969520	2972520	I was going to offer her a bagel.
2972520	2974520	Oh my god.
2974520	2975520	What am I rolling?
2975520	2976520	Humid.
2976520	2978520	I passed 24 on 70.
2978520	2980520	I failed a 93 on a 40.
2980520	2982520	Yeah, Cal fails.
2982520	2984520	I also got a 93.
2984520	2985520	Ooh, spooky.
2985520	2989520	Cal's looking at all the features of his everything bidet on the box.
2989520	2991520	Cover your ears real quick, Thomas and Joe.
2991520	2993520	Luke, something in their face.
2993520	2996520	When Stevie turns back, you see Shane.
2997520	3002520	So like I can tell from the footage it doesn't look like she's doing it completely against her will.
3002520	3003520	That's right.
3003520	3004520	That's exactly right.
3004520	3008520	And you two see the face of Stevie turn back.
3008520	3012520	They look at the camera and they turn back away and head off into the street.
3012520	3017520	The Ring camera footage is so high quality you can see the shame on Stevie's face.
3019520	3020520	I'm sorry.
3020520	3021520	I wasn't getting that from this footage.
3021520	3022520	What did you see?
3022520	3023520	Look.
3023520	3024520	Rewind it.
3024520	3025520	Look.
3025520	3026520	She's not making her do it.
3026520	3028520	She's doing it on her own but she knows.
3028520	3029520	Look.
3029520	3030520	She sees it right there.
3030520	3031520	She sees the camera.
3031520	3032520	She just looks ashamed.
3032520	3034520	I think she looks gassy.
3034520	3036520	I mean, could be.
3036520	3037520	Shame gas.
3037520	3041520	But I mean, Godel's not forcing her to do this.
3041520	3043520	It is her brother after all.
3043520	3046520	I mean, she was pretty forward with the idea that she was trying to help him.
3046520	3047520	Maybe this isn't all bad.
3047520	3052520	Maybe he talked her into this but she has a plan.
3053520	3055520	She wouldn't let him jump off of something.
3055520	3057520	She doesn't want her brother to die.
3057520	3058520	Could she stop him?
3058520	3059520	Yeah.
3059520	3061520	Even if she was on the way to somewhere she thought might help.
3061520	3062520	She's Trixie.
3062520	3064520	She might have something up her sleeve.
3064520	3065520	No, she's Stevie.
3065520	3066520	Oh, shit.
3066520	3069520	Trixie was kind of the burnout in turn.
3069520	3071520	The one with the vape pen.
3071520	3073520	I assume the buzzer.
3073520	3076520	Guys, I don't think the buzzer's working here.
3076520	3077520	We gotta find Vivica.
3077520	3079520	We gotta find Stevie.
3079520	3080520	Her window's that one.
3080520	3081520	Hang on a sec.
3081520	3083520	And I'm trying to find a pebble to throw at the window.
3083520	3084520	Oh, yeah.
3084520	3085520	There's plenty of pebbles.
3085520	3086520	Tink.
3086520	3087520	Vivica!
3087520	3089520	Vivica, it's back!
3089520	3090520	Vivica!
3090520	3094520	Is the door that leads up to the stairs a wooden door or a glass door?
3094520	3095520	What was it, Joe?
3095520	3096520	It was a glass door.
3096520	3097520	No, it wasn't.
3097520	3101520	If you're talking about my old apartment, it had a glass pane that you could see through.
3101520	3102520	On the outside it did.
3102520	3103520	Yeah, like the downstairs one.
3103520	3104520	What?
3104520	3105520	How tall?
3105520	3106520	You could see into the stairwell.
3106520	3110520	It had lettering on the window up to my apartment you could see through.
3110520	3111520	Interesting.
3111520	3114520	It said, Joe Terry, private eye.
3114520	3115520	Very much like that.
3115520	3117520	Dangerous dames turn around.
3117520	3118520	He had legs.
3118520	3119520	Two of them.
3119520	3120520	Guys, watch out.
3120520	3123520	They were walking all over me.
3123520	3127520	He could see through me like the glass door at the bottom of my apartment stairs.
3127520	3129520	Joe's apartment.
3129520	3134520	So yeah, you can kind of see, you can see the top of the stairs kind of through the glass,
3134520	3137520	but then there's the rest of the door is composite.
3137520	3139520	Guys, we gotta get in there.
3139520	3146520	And he hikes up his fancy work shorts and is going to try to kick this door in down.
3146520	3150520	I'm normally not a fan of property damage, but we don't know that our coworker is safe
3150520	3151520	right now.
3151520	3152520	Got those big powerful legs.
3152520	3153520	We should use them.
3153520	3158520	At the exact moment that you rear back on one of your enormous thighs, one of the...
3158520	3161520	Rear back on like he rocks the floor.
3161520	3162520	Yeah.
3162520	3167520	Eat some fucking spinach and one of them gets like Popeye-age.
3167520	3173520	One of the botanical employees walks out and goes to light a cigarette and as they're
3173520	3179520	about to light up, they look over at you as your leg is like up in the air about to kick
3179520	3181520	and their mouth just kind of drops.
3181520	3184520	But the cigarette sticks to their lip because it was dry.
3184520	3195520	Julia says, watch this and kicks.
3195520	3196520	Wow.
3196520	3202520	A plus 20 on strength or criminology, whichever one's higher.
3202520	3203520	Strength or criminology?
3203520	3204520	Yeah.
3204520	3205520	Let's see.
3205520	3206520	I don't think I have any criminology.
3206520	3207520	Nope.
3207520	3208520	Okay.
3208520	3209520	Let's see.
3209520	3210520	Up and down.
3210520	3211520	50-50.
3211520	3212520	With a plus 20 because...
3212520	3213520	Okay.
3213520	3214520	12 on a 70 then.
3214520	3215520	Oh.
3215520	3216520	Oh.
3216520	3217520	Oh.
3217520	3218520	Rocking.
3218520	3221520	Little did Julius know the door was just a little bit ajar.
3221520	3225520	So when he kicks it, it kicks hard and like smashes into the wall.
3225520	3230520	It looks like he kicked it open, like forced it open, but it was just gonna happen anyway.
3230520	3231520	Whoa.
3231520	3232520	Dude.
3232520	3234520	What the fuck?
3234520	3237520	Cal Colorado City Action News, step aside.
3237520	3239520	No persuing.
3239520	3241520	That's hilarious.
3241520	3245520	Did he roll the crit fail?
3245520	3246520	29.
3246520	3248520	I pass.
3248520	3254520	The cigarette trembling, still stuck on his lip as he just like quivers and backs up.
3254520	3259520	And he's just like going to light his cigarette in front of him, but the cigarette's not there
3259520	3261520	as he just kind of backs away.
3261520	3265520	Cal pushes everybody through and after they're up the stairs, I turn around and I'm like,
3265520	3268520	don't hassle my people again.
3268520	3272520	He goes, yes, sir.
3272520	3273520	Good boy.
3273520	3274520	Which apartment is hers?
3274520	3275520	I don't know.
3275520	3277520	Kick down all the doors.
3278520	3279520	We do know, right?
3279520	3281520	Yes, Beck Wilder does know.
3281520	3284520	I mean, in the fiction, I said I dropped her off.
3284520	3286520	But you said that's her window.
3286520	3287520	You did point at her window, you creep.
3287520	3288520	Okay, yeah.
3288520	3292520	It would be this one back here.
3292520	3293520	That's my favorite rock.
3293520	3294520	In the fiction, I said I dropped her off.
3294520	3300520	I didn't tell you that I'd gone around the back and know exactly where she lives.
3300520	3306520	I actually rented a place across the street with a good view.
3306520	3311520	Let me see, if I'm parked over there, then that would make it...
3311520	3312520	Is it this one?
3312520	3315520	And there's a doormat that just says Vivica on it.
3315520	3318520	Welcome to Vivica's place, the editor.
3324520	3327520	Julius wants to knock very aggressively on the door.
3330520	3332520	Vivica, give us our shit back!
3333520	3334520	Vivica?
3334520	3337520	Cowcall her out of here with Beck and Julius.
3337520	3338520	Hey, I'm here. I'm here.
3338520	3339520	We just want to talk.
3340520	3341520	Zach leaned away from the mic.
3341520	3342520	He's not gonna...
3342520	3345520	Yeah, like a toddler refusing to be fed.
3347520	3348520	Julius is gonna...
3348520	3349520	Go away!
3352520	3353520	Okay.
3353520	3354520	Wink.
3354520	3357520	You should open the door, though, for the next people to come in.
3359520	3360520	Great idea.
3360520	3361520	We'll get plumber's jumpsuits.
3362520	3364520	And fake mustaches.
3366520	3367520	Vivica, it's back.
3367520	3372520	Look, I know that you think you're maybe doing something good, and maybe you are.
3372520	3376520	Hey, are you just in there editing the footage with another pass like we talked about, maybe?
3376520	3380520	We just realized that the footage wasn't on us, and we figured maybe you had it,
3380520	3383520	and we want to make sure that we get backups.
3383520	3387520	Vivica, I haven't felt this way about a story in nearly 30 years,
3387520	3393520	and I think that caused me to be fairly short-sighted about showing you what was really on there.
3393520	3396520	So I want to say, I'm sorry. We're sorry.
3396520	3398520	We're really sorry, Vivica.
3398520	3401520	Would you let us in to talk about it?
3401520	3402520	The door opens.
3402520	3406520	Vivica stands in front of you, eyes red.
3406520	3411520	She has been through hell since the last time you saw her,
3411520	3416520	and she is trying so hard not to burst into tears again.
3416520	3419520	I was going to delete the...
3419520	3422520	I was going to delete...
3422520	3427520	I took the thumb drive, I'm sure that you yelled, I understand.
3427520	3430520	It was pretty funny, the sign.
3430520	3431520	I was going to... which sign?
3431520	3433520	Kick me?
3433520	3435520	She laughs a little bit.
3435520	3437520	There's the Vivica we all know.
3437520	3438520	Okay, yeah, thank you.
3438520	3442520	So I had a plan. I was going to take the footage, I was going to bring it back here,
3442520	3445520	I was going to figure out what to do with it, I was going to talk to people,
3445520	3447520	I was going to figure it out, I was going to talk to people,
3447520	3450520	I was going to let you in on it too, but we were high energy
3450520	3452520	and you guys seemed so gung-ho about getting it out
3452520	3454520	and I didn't want to get it out because I'm scared to get it out
3454520	3458520	because it's scary and terrifying and I needed to tell somebody else
3458520	3460520	and I needed to get somebody else's opinion.
3460520	3466520	So I decided to go wait and hide in the parking lot until after you all left
3466520	3470520	and then I went back into the building and I was going to go delete all the footage.
3470520	3472520	I wasn't going to delete it, but I was going to bring it back here
3472520	3475520	and I was always going to have the edit, but wait, let me fucking finish.
3475520	3481520	Cops came and they took it. The cops fucking took it all.
3481520	3486520	Why? They weren't even in uniform, they just came in and they took it
3486520	3489520	and where were you? You weren't there. No one was there.
3489520	3491520	And I couldn't do anything.
3491520	3493520	Did they take the thumb drive?
3493520	3494520	Yeah.
3494520	3495520	Can I hear a bit of that?
3499520	3500520	Yawn.
3500520	3501520	Yawning.
3502520	3503520	Yeah, yeah.
3503520	3505520	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3505520	3507520	Can I hear a bit of that?
3510520	3513520	Zach doesn't seem like he's taking this very seriously.
3513520	3515520	Better throw out a yawn.
3519520	3520520	Great, great show.
3520520	3522520	Yeah, good stuff, Zach.
3525520	3526520	This is great, this is great.
3526520	3528520	This is not like it when I yell at him.
3529520	3532520	It's late, I'm sleepy.
3532520	3535520	I thought it was fun when you yelled at me.
3537520	3541520	I just thought you sounded insincere when you said that last thing,
3541520	3543520	so I want to be human.
3543520	3545520	I don't remember what it was, but what did you roll?
3545520	3547520	It was about them taking the thumb drive.
3547520	3548520	Oh, the thumb drive.
3548520	3549520	Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.
3549520	3550520	Ooh, 24, a pass.
3550520	3551520	Yeah, no, she seems sincere.
3551520	3554520	You said they weren't in uniform, how do you know they were cops?
3555520	3560520	Came out of a cop car, went back into a cop car, showed me a badge, had guns.
3560520	3561520	Not nice.
3561520	3562520	Did you see a name?
3562520	3564520	It oinks like a pig.
3567520	3570520	Were the badges City Police Department?
3570520	3571520	Yeah.
3571520	3574520	I'm looking at the other guys, why would the police even know about it,
3574520	3576520	let alone want to come and get it?
3576520	3577520	Why would they want the footage like that?
3577520	3579520	Do you have a ring camera?
3579520	3580520	They got it from the...
3580520	3581520	At the office?
3581520	3582520	At the office, not here.
3582520	3584520	Does the office have a ring camera?
3584520	3585520	I'd assume the office has...
3585520	3586520	A lot of cameras.
3586520	3589520	We can see if these guys are real cops, what kind of car they pulled up in.
3589520	3592520	So Vivica, you're saying though that at the end of the day,
3592520	3594520	you don't have any of the footage at all?
3594520	3597520	You weren't able to maybe sneak some?
3597520	3599520	Maybe pulled out a hard drive or...
3599520	3600520	Just a sneaky little...
3600520	3601520	Her eyes go like blank.
3601520	3602520	I'm talking like my good friend, Ringo.
3602520	3605520	I tried to sneak some, but no, I didn't get any of them.
3605520	3608520	Sounds like it could be God all demons we're working with.
3608520	3609520	God all demons?
3609520	3610520	God turtle?
3610520	3615520	Yeah, like people, you know, God all sending people out to grab the stuff.
3615520	3617520	Maybe not actual demons, but who knows?
3617520	3620520	Let's go look at that footage and we've got to find...
3620520	3621520	We've got to find it.
3621520	3622520	We can't let them have it.
3622520	3627520	Cal has had like kind of an unworried little smirk on his face this whole time.
3627520	3631520	Guys, I'm sorry here, but it's in the hands of the police.
3631520	3633520	It's perfectly safe.
3633520	3639520	It's perfectly safe.
3639520	3642520	Cops like me.
3642520	3647520	Yucky ducky.
3647520	3651520	Cal answers the phone and you hear explosions and like screams in the background.
3651520	3654520	And he's like, Oh God, Julius, think, think, fuck, you're out of the hospital.
3654520	3657520	We got a big situation going on here with Stevie and God.
3657520	3658520	Got to go.
3658520	3660520	Peep.
3660520	3661520	What do you do?
3661520	3662520	Cal's call.
3662520	3664520	You get like, you see a call coming back like Cal, Colorado.
3664520	3666520	I answer it.
3666520	3667520	I'm sorry.
3667520	3668520	I forgot to tell you.
3668520	3669520	I'm dropping a pin.
3669520	3670520	I know how to do that now.
3670520	3671520	Click.
3671520	3674520	I wait for the pin and how far away is it?
3674520	3676520	How far away is the pin?
3676520	3679520	Like how far from the hospital is his apartment?
3679520	3685520	He gave me until noon to imagine what Cal, Colorado had gotten up to with his day.
3685520	3686520	Oh.
3686520	3687520	And I imagined we got another pic of it.
3687520	3688520	I thought it was real.
3688520	3689520	Yeah, it was all nonsense.
3689520	3690520	He's been asleep.
3690520	3691520	You wake him up.
3691520	3692520	Yeah, I think that's fair.
3702520	3710520	So you would have the footage on the drives that the camera records the footage onto the drives.
3710520	3714520	And then you take the drives to work, load them onto the computer.
3714520	3716520	You tell me how to do my job?
3721520	3725520	Cause my life is great.
3725520	3726520	Oh, that reminds me.
3726520	3727520	I already backed it up to the cloud.
3727520	3728520	We're good.
3728520	3729520	Oh, sweet.
3729520	3730520	I'm going to make pancakes.
3730520	3731520	Cool.
3731520	3734520	As you pull out your phone and look at the cloud and it's like...
3734520	3735520	It's raining.
3735520	3736520	Oh, it's not there.
3736520	3737520	Well, that's so weird.
3737520	3738520	No, no, no, Zach.
3738520	3739520	I'm sorry.
3739520	3742520	The end of music episode already started playing.
3742520	3744520	We are not there yet.
3744520	3747520	End of music episode.
3747520	3748520	The day the music died.
3748520	3750520	The end of music episode.
3750520	3753520	Yeah, that is some fucking dark ass shit.
3753520	3759520	And then Cthulhu comes out and he steals music.
3759520	3761520	Do you want to sing a sad song about it?
3761520	3763520	You can't, nerd.
3763520	3765520	Cut to a child's birthday party.
3765520	3767520	Happy birthday to you.
3767520	3768520	Happy birthday to you.
3768520	3770520	You're putting too much stank on it.
3770520	3774520	It's still like a third of a song.
3774520	3779520	Putting too much stank on it is my Spotify party playlist.
3779520	3786520	In the morning, Thomas was putting too much stank on it.
3786520	3790520	It's How Far is Heaven a hundred times.
3805520	3808520	Julius runs back down and sticks his head out and says,
3808520	3812520	put that on your bagel and smear it and then runs back up.
3812520	3816520	And he's like, Julius is like, fucking nailed it, yes.
3816520	3819520	And it's all my fault.
