0	4760	Rub, rub, rub, rub that magic lamp, baby.
4760	7360	Rub it up real nice.
7360	10080	Oh shit, I'm coming on out.
10080	12480	It's your gin who's hooked on gin
12480	15160	as long as it's made in a bathtub.
15160	18460	I'm your fermented genie wolf the dog.
18460	20280	And I'm granting you three wishes
20280	24360	as long as they're all about me and giving me cool stuff.
24360	26760	I'm getting rubbed on live here
26760	31760	over on 694.2 PTBP, my babies.
32000	37000	Do y'all think if you fed a cow enough paromchaun cheese
37360	39840	it would make some kind of Alfredo
39840	44480	come out those long milk skin tubes it's got on its tummy?
44480	46620	If you can help, please send answers
46620	49080	to this very serious inquiry
49080	51680	to at pretending pod on Twitter
51680	55080	or at pretending pod on Instagram
55080	58760	or tag us on Facebook as pretending to be people.
58760	63760	We here at 694.2 PTBP love getting to know our wolf pups
64400	65800	on the old internet.
65800	70120	So throw us a follow, a like, a retweet, a doggy treat,
70120	73240	and then join us in the subreddit r slash pretending
73240	76120	to be people and hop on into the discord
76120	80040	to hang, talk theories, and play games with other listeners.
80040	82800	It's a fucking sweetheart of a community.
82800	85640	There's links to all this shit in the show notes
85640	88880	and you know what would just be the swellest.
88880	93880	Swing on into Apple Podcasts and write up a five star review.
94120	98360	If it's truly spicy, your Wolfie might read it here on air.
98360	102120	Like I'm reading this one here from Ford Beeblebrox
102120	104820	titled You Should Probably Seek Therapy.
104820	108880	They write, the game is Delta Green, mostly.
108880	111600	The cast are humans, mostly.
111600	114320	The jokes are funny, five out of five.
114320	117120	After listening to this show, I'm not entirely certain
117120	119120	that I'm sane anymore though.
119120	121720	Do I need to talk to my dog more often?
121720	123800	Have I been to this bar before?
123800	126220	Is one of my eyeballs made of metal?
126220	129360	I don't wanna poke myself in the eye to find out,
129360	132120	but well, sanity has its limits.
132120	134900	Kind of a one way street, that one.
134900	138120	Anyway, if you want a story that is stupidly hilarious
138120	143120	while still being spooky, this is the one.
144040	149040	Start at episode one and just go forward, but seek therapy.
149240	151240	Ha ha ha ha ha.
151240	153560	Thank you, Ford Beeblebrox.
153560	156880	Don't panic, but make sure y'all always remember
156880	161200	to bring a towel because this show is very messy.
161200	166200	I give the review a 42 out of 42 stars, my babies.
167200	170480	For those insatiable garbage hounds out there
170480	173960	with the delicious luxury of financial stability,
173960	178560	you can support the show on patreon.com slash pretendinpod
178560	182640	and instantly access 11 bonus episodes,
182640	185400	the most recent of which is part one
185400	188640	of our playthrough of Lover in the Ice,
188640	193440	a legitimately nasty scenario for Delta Green.
193440	196040	Even I think that shit's nasty.
196800	198520	You know who I am.
198520	201500	This scenario was chosen by popular vote
201500	204080	in a poll exclusive to our patrons,
204080	206800	wherein y'all pups proved the filthy apple
206800	210480	doesn't fall too far from this fucking obscene tree.
210480	212280	Remember, y'all, hit up our Twitch
212280	215080	for some good video game and chill times.
215080	217080	I don't know what a video game is,
217080	219160	but I hear they're pretty fun.
219160	222560	Apparently, Justin has been doing some prime hang time
222560	226360	with the community there Tuesday and Thursday evenings,
226360	228280	chatting with y'all and such,
228280	232560	twitch.tv slash pretendinpodstreams.
232560	235240	Now, put your stress in suspension.
235240	237480	Give in to the ooze.
237480	242200	Decompress and contention and embrace the news.
242200	246040	The town of contention is very, very different.
246040	248140	There was a roadblock at the exit.
248140	251360	There are man-made puddles all over the place.
251360	253600	The town is quiet.
253600	256120	A massive wall of water filled with fish
256120	259620	surrounds the campus of the First Church of Contention.
259620	262640	In response, John Lee Bettymore the Thirth
262640	265460	just repeatedly slapped Keith's dad's watch
265460	267800	on wrist after wrist in an attempt
267800	270560	to gain as much information as possible.
270560	273220	One of those visions brought the name Silas Cole
273220	274780	back into the story.
274780	278660	Silas Cole was one of the founders of contention.
278660	281200	In his speech at his daughter's funeral,
281920	283640	Stan Manstein claimed.
283640	288640	My daughter was kind, hardworking, and good every time.
289960	292920	She was those things when she was a police officer.
292920	295720	She was those things when she was a school teacher.
295720	298920	She was those things when she was a historian.
298920	303000	You see, one long time ago when this land was stolen
303000	305320	and pioneer towns began to form,
305320	308400	Silas Cole was a miner in the mine
308400	312080	that employed the town nearby of contention.
312080	314040	While down in the mines,
314040	317720	Silas Cole came upon an odd black substance
317720	320700	and he became obsessed with studying it.
320700	324480	The substance was invisible to others, but not to Cole.
324480	327560	Exploiting the substance's wrong qualities,
327560	330280	he became an inventor and made so much money
330280	333400	off of his inventions that he bought the mine.
333400	335400	He built an office on the top floor
335400	337840	of the tall, skinny mining company building
338120	340640	that sat right above the mine itself.
340640	342840	He began to harvest the residue
342840	346400	and acquired a much firmer grasp on its tendencies.
346400	349120	He invented wild, magical things.
349120	352040	Each new invention brought him wealth and power,
352040	356680	but also released more of this inky substance into the town.
356680	358960	To divert his raising paranoia,
358960	361120	he began looking for a partner.
361120	363440	He found a similarly intelligent engineer
363440	367000	in his wife, Mary Cole, who could also see the substance
367000	369200	as they began calling residue.
369200	371920	But Silas Cole was scared of their inventions.
371920	375000	He became paranoid that other people could see the residue
375000	377520	that was loose all over the town.
377520	380560	Consumed, he believed the town was plotting against him,
380560	384820	so he began kidnapping people he suspected knew too much.
385840	388700	The town was suspicious of the disappearances,
388700	391920	but most of the ones gone were bad people.
391920	394720	The whole saloon staff, the bartender, Miss Kitty,
394720	396820	the piano player, there's a few gamblers,
397660	399420	the town drunk, so they kept their heads down
399420	401220	and went about their business.
401220	403180	But then some good people disappeared,
403180	406460	a professor, a circuit judge, a rancher, a homesteader,
406460	410100	the homesteader's wife, then the preacher disappeared.
410100	412900	The town freaked out and they hired a roaming cowboy
412900	415180	named Cornelius Beans to kill
415180	418540	their weird, paranoid figurehead.
418540	421820	Silas and Mary Cole were never seen again.
421820	424500	Neither was Cornelius Beans.
424500	428300	That was the history of contention,
428300	432580	when my daughter's name was Mia or Leah or Micah or Ben,
432580	435380	but her name is Ari forever now,
435380	437820	and our history is different.
437820	440660	Mine is now definite.
440660	444540	Before they could continue binge-watching,
444540	446940	Keith heard the voice of Terrence Licker
446940	449380	threateningly holler at Randy Anx
449380	452100	from an idling truck about a block away.
452100	453860	Keith has beef.
453860	457540	Tea Licker owes him three fucking dollars.
457540	460460	At Randy's, John found his cousin, Jimmy,
460460	462880	a bit off his rocker in a truck bed
462880	465020	that's been puddle-teamed,
465020	467340	and Clark saw Randy through the window
467340	471380	being held down by a man in cahoots with Terrence Licker.
471380	473120	Keith just grabbed the keys
473120	474820	from out of the truck's ignition,
474820	476840	tipping off the opposition,
476840	478820	delivering us now to a scene
478820	481220	that puts the tension in contention.
481260	484900	It's kudzu with no back bone.
515460	518100	Hello, everyone, and welcome to Pretending to Be People.
518100	520460	We are on episode 80.
520460	523660	My name is Zach, and I am the one leading you
523660	526980	through this adventure with my words,
526980	529460	just painting pictures of scenes
529460	534220	that you are then forced to see inside of your own mind,
534220	538180	and helping me concoct these very, very logical
538180	541180	and easy-to-follow stories are my three...
544900	546900	...e...
557380	559940	...best friends.
559940	561620	Thanks for having us. Oh, this is really awkward.
561620	564260	We are three best friends,
564260	565940	but we're not best friends with you.
565940	568700	Yes! Yeah, we're all three best friends.
568700	570500	No, no, no, like the three of us.
570500	571740	The three of us are best friends.
571740	573060	He owns us, so we're his.
573060	576180	No, but we've done, like, his three best friends.
576180	578900	I definitely have three best friends here, for sure.
578900	581020	Yeah, exactly, is what we're trying to say,
581020	583100	but every time we get together with you,
583100	585980	you're like, I've got these stories to tell.
585980	588620	You have to play in them, and it's like, God,
588620	592860	sometimes I just want to fucking tell you about my day.
592860	595260	Anyway, that's why you're not top three.
595260	596700	Oh, that's a really good point, Thomas.
596700	599500	Tell me about your day.
599500	602060	Oh, well, it's...
602100	603220	I fucking got you.
607020	608740	I don't consider you one of my best friends,
608740	610340	so I don't want to share that.
612340	614700	It's 2020, Thomas, tell me about your day.
616700	617740	What?
617740	620180	Tell me about your day.
620180	621740	It rained today.
621740	623420	It did rain all day.
623420	626020	My dog got muddy, and I gave her a bath.
626020	629300	I had to wipe my dog's paws off when he came inside,
629300	630260	but he didn't get muddy.
630260	632300	I let my dog run around outside for an hour,
632300	633820	and she rolled in mud.
633820	634660	I said, you know what?
634660	635500	Have your fun.
636500	639100	I let Joe outside, but his feet were dry as fuck
639100	640140	when he came back in.
641220	642500	It's a thing that they do.
643660	644500	They're so dry.
644500	645540	They just auto dry.
647020	649380	Joe, I so enjoy our walks.
649380	650220	I do too.
650220	651780	Sometimes you let me off the leash.
653380	656220	Until you attack families.
656220	660380	I just get excited.
663540	666220	I've just been picturing Joe this whole time.
666220	668060	On all fours.
668060	673060	Yeah, but like smiling, like smile growling.
673740	676900	Hey, so everybody keeping it together during quarantine?
676900	677740	Nope.
680180	681420	All right.
681420	682540	It's hard to
682540	687540	get anything done.
690340	694060	I'm having a difficult time focusing on anything.
694060	698060	You guys, do you guys feel my, feel it?
698060	700380	Have you tried staying up until like five or six
700380	702700	in the morning and then waking up after noon,
702700	704120	quite a bit after noon?
705300	706140	You know what?
706140	706960	I have.
706960	707800	That's how I tried.
707800	710340	That was the first thing I tried, yeah.
710340	711900	The cool thing that happens with me
712100	714540	is that my sleep schedule seems to just like rotate
714540	718300	throughout the week as if it's completely divorced
718300	722100	from the rotation of our own planet.
722100	727100	So one day a week for sure I'll be up till five
727900	729980	and then that kind of shifts.
729980	734540	Sometimes I go to bed at 7 p.m. and then wake up at 5 a.m.
734540	736600	and then other times it's the opposite.
736600	739700	Yeah, my vices are pushing me basically
739700	741380	like wholeheartedly at this point.
741700	745120	They've taken the reins on when I sleep.
745120	748540	So it's purely caffeine and weed,
748540	750820	just like back and forth and back and forth
750820	755020	until I am either awake and able to do stuff
755020	757960	like freak out or asleep.
757960	760220	I've been huffing paint to go to sleep.
762780	763620	Congrats, man.
763620	764440	I'm really proud of you.
764440	766660	I ran out of glue, so.
766660	768100	Gotta graduate.
768100	769840	I don't know which one I prefer, honestly.
769840	771860	I prefer Glue, Luke.
771860	772700	Glue.
772700	773520	Glue.
773520	774640	Paint Luke is a little edgy.
777320	779200	You don't like my silver goatee?
781760	782980	Five years.
782980	784640	It doesn't feel like it's been five years
784640	786660	since Fairy Road came out, but it has been
786660	789080	and that's what we're talking about for this whole hour
789080	791200	here on Pretending to Be People.
791200	792360	Oh, that'd be fucking awesome.
792360	793200	I would do that.
793200	795060	Half decade anniversary of one of the greatest
795060	795900	action movies ever made.
795900	798160	Did it really come out five years ago?
798160	799000	Damn.
799000	800120	I saw it in IMAX.
800120	802000	It blew my mind.
802000	805320	I saw it three times in theaters.
805320	807000	I saw it twice in theaters.
807000	809620	The second time was someone who I dated
809620	813640	for nearly two years, but I shouldn't have
813640	815560	because at the start of our relationship
815560	818720	we saw Fury Road and she was like, I fucking hated that.
820940	822440	Yeah, you should have known to hop out
822440	824920	right then and there, but if you had,
824920	828540	we wouldn't be friends, so I'm glad that you stuck around.
829560	831560	Sorry and thanks.
831560	833400	I can't imagine that she would
833400	835640	much less make it 80 episodes.
837160	839400	Every time I worry about saying something,
839400	842560	A, they're not gonna listen to it this far in
842560	845120	and B, if they just decided to like listen
845120	847480	to episode 80 for some reason,
847480	850040	if they make it all the way through Wolf the Dog
850040	852680	not knowing what the fuck is going on,
852680	855760	then they deserve to hear what I think about it.
855760	858400	Who are you thinking about in particular right now
858440	860400	that you wanna just say like fuck you two
860400	861240	or like something bad about him?
861240	864400	My dad, I love him so much that it's just like,
865280	867160	you know when you love someone so much,
867160	870080	you know when you're like.
870080	871360	Fuck you, dad.
871360	874960	C, Thomas, when a boy loves his father.
874960	876200	Very much.
877800	880880	Do you guys wanna play some role playing?
880880	883120	I wanna hear more about the dads and the Bs.
883120	884980	You fuck your dad and make a mom.
885900	888900	Where do mommies come from?
888900	891260	When a son loves a father very much.
900740	903340	Yes, we here at Pretending to Be People
903340	908340	are very tolerant, even encouraging of behavior
908560	912220	far past that that is recognized as appropriate.
912220	913380	Hold on, encouraging?
915980	918860	Oh yeah, no, I just misspoke terribly just now.
920820	921780	Not when I'm in it all.
921780	925180	Listen, we here at PTBP defend your right
925180	926860	to fuck your dad.
926860	928060	Consensually.
928060	929180	In the pursuit of a mom.
929180	930220	Right. Exactly.
930220	932060	Okay, so now that we're all on the same page.
932060	933100	We're pro mom.
935620	938220	As it says in Ecclesiastes 4.16.
938220	939980	Fuck your dad.
939980	941460	In the pursuit of your mom.
941460	942300	Yes.
944540	946660	John Lee Pettymore the third is standing
946660	949820	on the driveway of Randy Angst's home.
949820	952400	He's staring into the bed of a truck
952400	955620	that is made into a puddle that is teaming with fish
955620	959880	and also not so much teaming, but consisting of a body
959880	961800	that it belongs to Jimmy Sanders.
961800	963540	However, the mind of Jimmy Sanders,
963540	966560	it is unsure of whether or not he is still in there
966560	969540	because he is not acting himself.
969540	971780	When he saw John Lee Pettymore the third,
971780	975660	he dove into this water around the side of the car,
975660	978340	standing there with holding the keys.
978340	980580	They were just in the ignition of this truck
980580	981980	is Keith Vigna.
981980	984980	And standing outside the side of the house,
984980	987660	looking in the window is Clark Bishop.
987660	991420	You notice that this man, this burly as fuck,
991420	996160	five foot four, rocky sweat suit wearing motherfucker.
997140	999260	You know him as Fade.
999820	1000660	It's a nickname.
1000660	1004780	His name is Luca Fajevic, but everybody calls him Fade.
1004780	1005620	Shout out.
1005620	1007660	Luke was like, what'd you call me?
1007660	1012540	Shout out to Lucas from Connecticut,
1012540	1016580	one of our patrons who is at the $10 level,
1016580	1019500	which is called the honorary police officers.
1019500	1024500	And he submitted Luca Fade Fajevic as his MPC.
1024940	1028780	Luca Fade Fajevic and Terrence Licker
1028780	1031180	are standing over Randy Angst.
1031180	1035640	And Randy Angst is face down in his own carpet
1035640	1038140	wearing a fancy blue suit.
1038140	1040900	And to the right of him, there's a cane.
1040900	1044940	You'd remember that Randy Angst uses a cane to get around,
1044940	1046860	so it's not necessarily great.
1046860	1048620	You do see this cane next to him
1048620	1051420	has a big Rubik's Cube on the top.
1051420	1056340	Standing right behind Luca Fade Fajevic
1056340	1060260	is T. Licker, Terrence Licker,
1060260	1063260	famed beef-haver with Keith Bigna.
1063260	1064460	Beef house.
1064460	1065780	I smell like beef.
1065780	1069060	He says, all right there, Randy.
1069060	1070960	We just need to get you on out there.
1070960	1072980	We need bodies and you know we need them.
1072980	1075680	And you know, if you want things to go back,
1075680	1078920	if you want back to where it used to be,
1078920	1080380	then you can have it, you know?
1080380	1083660	And the truck engine outside stops.
1083660	1087140	It's combat order time, and I say combat order,
1087140	1089620	but what I really mean is initiative.
1089620	1093100	And therefore, we will begin as we always do
1093100	1094060	with Clark Bishop.
1094060	1095720	Do they see me?
1095720	1097220	Wait, do we have said initiative?
1097220	1102060	The initiative in Delta Green is based on dexterity
1102060	1105140	and therefore it should be Clark Bishop,
1105140	1108420	then Keith Bigna, then John Lee Pettymore, I believe.
1108420	1110220	Mine is a default 55,
1110220	1112820	but I think if I've annotated this right,
1112820	1116080	that's minus 10 for my robot abilities, so 45.
1116080	1116980	I'm at 60.
1116980	1119560	And Clark Bishop has a talent that lets him go first
1119560	1121140	at the beginning of any combat.
1121140	1123440	And because I like to make things easy on myself,
1123440	1128180	it always goes PCs, then NPCs, then back to the PCs.
1128180	1129820	So you guys get to begin first.
1129820	1131020	Clark Bishop, what are you doing?
1131020	1131940	They heard the car stop.
1131940	1135120	Do they look up and see me or where do they look?
1135120	1137500	They look to the front of the house.
1137500	1138780	They do not see you.
1138780	1139860	When we were approaching the house,
1139860	1142180	I assumed there was a back door on this place.
1142180	1146300	I'm gonna try sneaking my way back to the back door.
1146300	1147760	Okay, Keith Bigna, what are you doing?
1147760	1149940	I wanna search the console and the truck
1149940	1151180	and see if there's anything in there.
1151180	1152180	Okay, real search.
1153540	1155380	What are you looking for?
1155380	1157060	He asked right as you crit.
1160180	1161820	Everything you have.
1161820	1163500	I'm just looking in there to see what's in there,
1163500	1165460	but mostly I'm looking for money,
1165460	1168100	specifically at least $3
1168100	1171900	and any weapons that might be in there.
1171900	1173620	I know that you critically succeeded,
1173620	1176100	but there's no chance that there's money in there
1176100	1180380	because that'll be so much more fun to role play out later.
1183140	1185440	So if you're looking for weapons.
1185440	1186980	I don't know, it'd be pretty fucking funny
1186980	1189620	if Keith finds three bucks in that guy's center console
1189620	1191900	and then comes in like, the debt is settled
1191900	1194540	and he has no fucking clue what Keith's talking about.
1196340	1199180	Make it so.
1199180	1201240	That's what the bald man says, right?
1201240	1203600	Yeah, zero, zero.
1203600	1206480	If I roll a zero, that's a critical failure, right?
1206480	1207320	That's 100?
1207320	1208220	That's 100.
1208220	1209060	Yeah.
1209060	1210800	Good thing I just rolled that idly.
1213240	1214620	I need to stop doing that.
1214620	1215500	I know, I don't know.
1215500	1216700	Luke, what do you want?
1219060	1220700	I mean, I don't know.
1221980	1223040	Give me something cool.
1223040	1224260	Oh, okay, yeah, no, sorry.
1224260	1229060	You open up the glove box and I will ask Joe and Thomas
1229060	1230900	to take your headphones off.
1230900	1234080	Luke, when Keith Vigna reaches into the console
1234080	1238220	and opens it, there is a piece of paper,
1238220	1242020	standard, eight and a half by 11, folded four times,
1242020	1245600	and when you unfold it, it is a picture of you,
1245600	1249340	Keith Vigna, handwritten underneath it.
1249340	1252980	It says, bring alive.
1252980	1254200	Oh shit.
1255160	1256000	You also find a mag light.
1256000	1256840	Okay.
1256840	1259480	Like one of those long, hefty mag lights,
1259480	1262240	so now you've got like a legit flashlight
1262240	1265440	as well as basically a lead pipe as far as.
1265440	1266280	Tight, tight.
1266280	1268240	You can do some serious damage with the guy.
1268240	1269060	Okey-doke.
1271400	1273160	I found an atom bomb.
1273160	1275400	Actually, we're trying to go more woke.
1275400	1277280	It's an Eve bomb.
1277280	1278120	What's that?
1278120	1279120	Oh shit.
1279400	1284400	So I hit the red button and I explode the atom bomb.
1290760	1293000	Thomas, John Lee Pettymore, what are you doing?
1293000	1296300	Yeah, probably dying if Luke blows up the atom bomb.
1296300	1297140	I asked him what he wanted.
1297140	1302140	No, no, I'm fishing around in the truck bed
1302640	1305240	trying to pull Jimmy Sanders out of the water.
1305240	1306080	Yeah, okay.
1306080	1310280	As you grab onto his arm, he kind of surfaces
1310280	1311800	and he's like.
1311800	1314240	I gave him two big slaps.
1314240	1316480	Two big slaps?
1316480	1318600	Okay, roll unarmed combat.
1322800	1323640	Okay, 87.
1323640	1325800	I pass with a 32.
1325800	1326880	Nope, I failed.
1326880	1329560	He dodges out of the way of both slaps
1329560	1333080	and dives back underneath the water
1333120	1336240	as you hear the front door open.
1336240	1337420	I turn to look at that.
1337420	1341880	You see, Luka Fajevic, this super burly,
1341880	1344880	quite short, wide dude comes out,
1344880	1347960	these bright white teeth looking like Rocky.
1347960	1352960	He comes out first and he has got a crowbar in his hand.
1353760	1355000	Hey, who the fuck?
1355000	1356760	And he looks and he, of course,
1356760	1360120	he sees Keith Vigna inside of the truck
1360120	1365120	and he sees John Lee Pettymore III standing in the driveway.
1365480	1369080	Oh, Terrence, Terrence, hey man, get over here.
1369080	1370400	We found him.
1370400	1371240	He came to us.
1371240	1372420	He's just right here.
1372420	1373960	Let's fucking get him.
1373960	1378640	And Fajevic is coming straight for you and he is.
1378640	1379840	He's walking here.
1383920	1386920	And Terrence Liger is following behind
1386920	1391160	but does not seem to have any sort of weapon
1391160	1392840	in his hand currently.
1392840	1396720	Keith motherfucking beans, you piece of shit.
1396720	1401480	And he comes out and he's reaching behind him currently
1401480	1402680	in his back pocket.
1402680	1404320	Clark Bishop, it is your turn
1404320	1406540	and you are walking in the back door currently.
1406540	1408640	I wanna get to Randy.
1408640	1410360	Is he still on the ground?
1410360	1411960	Oh, God, yes.
1411960	1412800	We're here to help you.
1412800	1413620	We're here to help you.
1413620	1414460	Hang on.
1414460	1415280	Yes, shh.
1415280	1416120	Find cover, find cover.
1416640	1418680	I wanna kind of walk past him to the front.
1418680	1420400	I mean, I'm sneaking up on the guys.
1420400	1421240	You can do that.
1421240	1423360	He's gonna crawl into his fireplace.
1423360	1425020	Does it smell like Randy shit his pants?
1425020	1425860	Oh, no.
1427640	1431160	And the house just reeks of,
1431160	1435560	it's like the heat is turned up super, super high
1435560	1437920	because it is pretty cold out today.
1437920	1440000	It's been a temperate December so far
1440000	1443480	but this is certainly the coldest it's been,
1443480	1446240	mostly so that the animals would have somewhere
1446240	1449320	to be for a while and I could really get that plot going.
1449320	1453040	But, so as it's gotten much colder,
1453040	1455680	Randy has got the heat turned way up.
1455680	1458880	So it's like that thing where you fart in the shower
1458880	1461000	and the heat just like keeps it down.
1462440	1463560	What?
1463560	1464400	Do you not know what I'm talking about?
1464400	1466000	I know what you're talking about.
1466000	1468240	What do you mean keeps it down?
1468240	1470540	It keeps it down.
1470540	1473200	Like permeates it.
1473800	1475840	Keeps it down wasn't really the right-
1475840	1478640	No, cause like heat rises and farts are heat.
1478640	1481360	You're saying you fart up the whole shower
1481360	1482600	and it keeps it in there.
1482600	1485760	Yeah, because like the steam is sitting on top of the fart
1485760	1487560	cause the fart can't make it through the steam, right?
1487560	1490720	And so the fart is just like where your head is
1490720	1492200	cause the steam's right above that.
1492200	1497200	Where's your head at in your farts, in your fart?
1498000	1500920	No, that doesn't happen to me when I fart in the shower.
1504200	1505520	Whatever loser.
1505520	1507920	All right, so you guys are,
1509080	1511920	Randy Yanks' house smells like shit cause it's hot fart.
1511920	1514280	Farting out so many shit particles
1514280	1517760	that they're able to attach to like the water droplets
1517760	1518600	and permeate the air.
1518600	1520720	Well, I'm not going to poop before I get in the shower.
1520720	1523000	I'm not saying you should, but,
1523000	1525160	oh wait, actually you should.
1525160	1526000	There's nothing worse than-
1526000	1528120	There's literally, it's the worst feeling on earth.
1528120	1530400	The humid after shower shit.
1530400	1532460	Getting a hot shower, taking a shit
1532580	1535540	and just having the toilet paper just soggy and-
1535540	1537380	Oh my God.
1537380	1538220	Oh God.
1538220	1539060	Just poop in the shower.
1539060	1540620	And then you take another shower.
1540620	1542780	Yep, a minute second shower.
1542780	1544100	And cheese grate it.
1544100	1545260	Just smash it down.
1545260	1546940	Is that where you just stomp it?
1546940	1549140	Oh yeah, I knew it had a name.
1549140	1551060	Pour some shampoo on it to clean it.
1551060	1553820	Pour some shampoo on it.
1553820	1557460	Thomas is here for these songs.
1557460	1558300	Dang, I love it.
1558300	1559980	I can't wait until we're all in one room
1559980	1561220	and we can sing together.
1561220	1563820	Oh my God, I miss it.
1563820	1565620	Smells like shit in this house.
1565620	1567300	Keith Vigna, it's your turn.
1567300	1569860	I help Randy into the fireplace and I say,
1569860	1571780	dude, it smells like a shower fart in here.
1571780	1576780	I'm so sorry, it's just that the heat is pushing it down.
1579420	1580460	Joe, real fucking talk,
1580460	1581740	does it happen to you in the shower?
1581740	1586580	I don't know the science behind it, but yes, it does.
1586580	1589420	Yes, I feel like when I fart in the shower, I get nothing.
1589420	1590860	Like it dissipates better.
1591860	1593980	When we're in the shower together.
1593980	1596980	Oh yeah, when we're all pressed together, then yeah.
1596980	1599100	Like obviously, right.
1599100	1602140	I also can't wait until we're all in one room to do that.
1602140	1603780	Right, that's how we usually record
1603780	1606100	all naked together in a shower.
1607780	1609620	It's just the audio quality is so much better.
1609620	1612300	Well, I mean, that's the work you put in
1612300	1615340	to take the shower sounds out of each track.
1615340	1618780	And I know that takes you roughly 72 hours per track.
1619780	1622540	It's a lot of music and rubber ducky in the background.
1622540	1623620	You got to edit all that out.
1623620	1626140	That's the work that goes into each podcast, y'all,
1626140	1629020	before this horrible quarantine situation
1629020	1631580	where we can't shower and record together anymore.
1631580	1634100	Heartbreaking is what I would call that.
1634100	1634940	Fartbreaking.
1634940	1637260	Honestly, we have it the worst.
1637260	1638820	Keith Vigna, you are...
1643700	1644540	That was a good one.
1644540	1647220	Keith, you're in the cab of this truck
1647220	1649940	as these two men walk outside.
1649940	1650780	What do you do?
1650780	1654340	I see them, I jump out of the truck,
1654340	1658660	I get my gun, and I yell,
1658660	1660860	don't come any closer, I'll shoot.
1660860	1663180	And when the camera pans back to me,
1663180	1665220	I've got the gun up to my own head.
1665220	1667060	Yes!
1667060	1668780	Chomp, chomping right there.
1668780	1671060	Hell yes, hell yes.
1671060	1672500	Oh, you get 10 luck.
1672500	1673340	Hell yeah.
1673340	1674500	Nice, hell yeah.
1674500	1675900	Thomas, do the same thing.
1677220	1680420	He puts the watch on.
1680420	1683340	I put my gun to Keith's head.
1687780	1690500	Okay, John Lee, Betty Moore III, what are you doing?
1690500	1692580	Trevor, Trevor is his name?
1692580	1693420	Nope, Terrence.
1693420	1694420	Terrence, Terrence.
1694420	1696060	You've known this guy for years.
1696060	1696900	Yeah, John has.
1696900	1698820	You've heard me talk about him forever.
1698820	1701260	Terrence has his hand on his gun, right?
1701260	1702580	But the other guy does not.
1702580	1704820	The other guy's holding a crowbar.
1704820	1706580	Oh yeah, I just start firing at them,
1706580	1709260	trying to suppress them and get them back into the house.
1709260	1713100	Okay, roll firearms and who are you firing at?
1713100	1715100	Both of them or are you just doing suppressing fire?
1715100	1716740	Are you actually trying to hit somebody?
1716740	1717580	Crowbar guy.
1717580	1718420	Fade.
1718420	1719860	I wanna leave the other one for Luke.
1719860	1721540	Very kind.
1721540	1723260	That's just good storytelling right there.
1723260	1725100	That's friendship storytelling.
1725100	1726260	It's like it would be smarter
1726260	1728500	to take out the guy with the gun, but.
1728500	1729340	Yeah, probably.
1730180	1735180	47 on a six D.
1736900	1737980	Roll a D 10.
1737980	1738820	Three.
1738820	1740940	All right, three will be a shoulder hit
1740940	1743980	as John Lee Pettymore pulls his firearm
1743980	1748820	and hits Luca Fade Fudgevitz right in the shoulder.
1748820	1752180	Hands off your fucking gun, drop the crowbar.
1752180	1754660	So you fire at him while yelling that
1754660	1758180	and this just like jacked dude.
1758180	1761300	You know Fade is the guy who has just been like
1761300	1765980	hanging out on his front lawn for the past like four years,
1765980	1768460	only doing like arm day.
1768460	1771100	Like he only gives a fuck about his upper body.
1771100	1773300	So he's got these little chicken legs now,
1773300	1775180	whereas you know, like when he was younger,
1775180	1777740	he used to be like a bodybuilder
1777740	1780020	and now he's just given up on his legs.
1780020	1781740	He's got this massive upper body
1781740	1783460	and as soon as you shoot him in the shoulder,
1783460	1785620	he drops the crowbar and he's like,
1785700	1787780	ow, ow, what the fuck, man?
1787780	1790580	They didn't know he couldn't do that, man.
1790580	1793340	Luca, are you just that nice, man?
1793340	1795900	It's just Fade, it's me, man.
1795900	1799140	Fade, I'm sorry about your sick lats,
1799140	1803140	but you're coming at some police officers.
1803140	1804580	You gotta put those weapons down.
1804580	1808620	I know, you're police officers, what?
1808620	1811540	And he like slumps up against the garage,
1811540	1813860	like backs into the garage
1813860	1816380	and then slumps down the white garage door,
1816380	1820740	leaving a trail of red as he like hits his butt
1820740	1822940	on the concrete below and he's like,
1822940	1825660	man, we just want Keith, man.
1825660	1829220	This is my voice now forever, man.
1829220	1830380	Keith's with us.
1830380	1832860	And as you say Keith's with us,
1832860	1837260	Terrence Licker holds his gun at his head.
1837260	1841020	Keith, Vigna, you think you can play mind games with me?
1841060	1844140	You think you were here about the smartest man in town,
1844140	1847420	but I think otherwise with Anya, for sure.
1849460	1853140	Terrence, is his back to the door?
1853140	1854060	It is.
1854060	1856780	I wanna sneak up and wrestle away the gun from him,
1856780	1858260	from behind him.
1858260	1860100	I feel like I should get some kind of advantage on that.
1860100	1862300	He doesn't know I'm in there.
1862300	1863500	He doesn't know I'm in there.
1863500	1865460	He's got it up against his head.
1865460	1866940	So how are you doing that?
1866940	1868060	Pulling his arm backwards
1868060	1869420	so it's gonna hurt his arm some
1869460	1871740	and get the gun pointed not at his head.
1871740	1873140	And I'm trying to get it out of his hand.
1873140	1874420	I'm trying to take it for my own.
1874420	1876060	I'll give you an option.
1876060	1877900	I will either let you do this
1877900	1880220	if you can pass a stealth check
1880220	1885180	or I'll just give you a bonus on your unarmed combat.
1885180	1886820	I'll take the bonus on the unarmed.
1886820	1889300	Okay, so he'll roll against you on that.
1889300	1891140	Go ahead and roll that unarmed combat.
1895940	1897060	What's my bonus?
1897060	1900940	Oh, you get a plus 20.
1901980	1903660	You sure it's not plus 30, right?
1905460	1907820	So as you go to grab this guy's gun,
1907820	1911060	his hands go straight up in the air, the gun fires,
1911060	1913820	and then the gun falls to the ground
1913820	1915900	out of the reach of either one of you.
1915900	1920500	It flings itself as it's firing up out of your hands
1920500	1924780	and you two are just standing right outside the front door
1924780	1928220	almost to the driveway of Randy Angst's home,
1928220	1930940	gun 10 feet away in the grass.
1930940	1931780	Keith Vigna.
1931780	1935580	I want to run at him with the mag light
1935580	1937860	and try to whack him in the head.
1937860	1939300	Yeah, yeah, okay.
1939300	1943420	Actually, so he crit failed with a 99.
1944420	1946060	Okay, do I need to roll anything?
1946060	1946900	Yeah, go ahead and roll.
1946900	1948740	Melee weapons.
1948740	1950780	An eight on a 30.
1950780	1951820	Hell yeah, tweet.
1951860	1955380	So basically whatever you want to happen
1955380	1957900	can happen here close to it.
1957900	1959500	As the scuffle's going on or whatever,
1959500	1961820	the gun goes off, I holster my gun,
1961820	1965580	grab the flashlight from the front seat,
1965580	1969460	run over to him and just like right in the teeth,
1969460	1970580	hit him with the mag light.
1970580	1974500	Oof, roll a D6.
1974500	1975340	Three.
1975340	1977180	You shoot him in the shoulder.
1977180	1979900	It's a joke about how three damage did that earlier.
1979900	1981380	Fucking nailed it.
1981380	1982220	Trust it in.
1984940	1987380	So you hit him right in the mouth
1987380	1991900	and two teeth go flying as he hits the ground.
1991900	1995140	Clark, he is like pushed into you by this movement
1995140	1998140	and you are now in between him and the gun
1998140	2002340	and he is now prone on the ground, bleeding from his mouth.
2002340	2005820	Luka Fajevic's fade is also on the ground
2005820	2008940	with a gunshot wound in his shoulder bleeding
2008940	2012620	and Thomas is taking off his robe.
2018140	2019780	All right, there it is.
2019780	2022180	Oh, Luke is going shirtless as well.
2022180	2023020	Here we go.
2023900	2027540	I like the beanie with the shirtless look, Thomas.
2027540	2029300	It's a good combo there.
2029300	2031180	Thank you, it's cold in my house.
2031180	2032020	Oh.
2037540	2039140	You guys both have great nips.
2039140	2039980	Thanks.
2039980	2040820	Am I allowed to say that?
2040820	2042300	No.
2042300	2043140	Oh, okay.
2043140	2044780	Luke, you've got great nips.
2044780	2046380	It's an invasion of my privacy.
2047940	2049020	Stop looking at me.
2054660	2057060	I have no idea where I was.
2057060	2059460	Oh no, did our distraction work?
2062020	2067020	Well, it's not like the NPCs were destroying you guys
2068260	2070540	so you were trying to distract me.
2070540	2073900	You've got this easily in hand, I believe, at this point.
2073900	2075060	Oh, I know, it's just late.
2075060	2077220	It is John Lee Pettymore's turn.
2087220	2088980	And obviously, John Lee Pettymore knows
2088980	2090620	exactly what's going on
2090620	2094420	because he wasn't wasting his time Zoom stripping.
2094420	2095580	You're good at that, by the way.
2095580	2097180	You might want to talk to Terrence Licker.
2097180	2099740	So, John Lee Pettymore,
2099740	2102220	you are looking at Luka Fade Fajevic
2102220	2104300	who is bleeding up against the garage.
2104300	2106580	You are looking at Keith Vigna
2106580	2111180	who just took a mag light to the face of Terrence Licker
2111180	2113860	who is now ass grounded.
2113860	2116980	And you see Clark Bishop just to the right of them.
2116980	2118620	Yes, I said ass grounded.
2119620	2122140	And Clark Bishop is standing to the right of them,
2122140	2124380	almost in the neighbor's yard at this point.
2124380	2126300	But you guys are all just around this
2126300	2129580	front of the house area and it is your turn currently.
2129580	2131220	All right, so gun drawn.
2131220	2134100	Don't move a fucking muscle, you're under arrest.
2134100	2135620	He's not even a cop.
2135620	2137900	I don't even think that one's a cop.
2137900	2140860	It's complicated, but I am.
2140860	2142500	You're under arrest.
2142500	2145180	None of y'all wearing police uniform.
2145180	2146380	Are you not even on duty?
2146380	2148140	You ain't been around, the world is different.
2148460	2149740	I shoot him in the leg.
2151380	2154740	No, I don't, dude, I don't actually.
2154740	2158180	So, okay, so he draws his gun and he says all that
2158180	2159460	and he's like, I am a cop.
2162220	2163060	Damn it.
2163060	2165340	All right, John Lee Pettymore's having like a breakdown
2165340	2168300	in the driveway, you cannot figure out what's going on.
2168300	2170820	Shut up, that's not what happens.
2170820	2173460	I'm such a strong man, why have I maimed him?
2173460	2178460	All right, I'm advancing on them with my gun drawn.
2178900	2180340	You're under arrest.
2180340	2182380	For real, I'm a cop.
2182380	2186420	Luca is the one closest to you and he's looking up at you
2186420	2189020	from the ground up against the garage.
2189020	2191300	Hey, hey, who are you?
2191300	2192580	A cop, god damn.
2192580	2194980	What, you're under arrest.
2194980	2197380	What are you doing with this Keith Wigner fella?
2197380	2198580	He's a cop too.
2198580	2200500	Yeah, but you weren't a cop here before.
2200500	2203500	I don't have time to explain any of this to you.
2203500	2206220	I am ball, motherfucker.
2206220	2208580	I slap him across the face and I handcuff him.
2208580	2212300	Okay, so here's a pretty decent issue.
2212300	2214060	You don't have any handcuffs.
2214060	2215060	Don't I?
2215060	2216140	No, you don't.
2216140	2220180	You used your handcuffs on the body of Drew Andrews.
2220180	2221260	That's right.
2221260	2224660	No, no, no, no, no, those were Clark's handcuffs.
2224660	2225500	Yes.
2225500	2226620	But I don't know if you would have any.
2226620	2228620	Didn't you give me feet and hand shackles
2228660	2231140	because we said that that's what cops would use in the 70s?
2231140	2231980	Yeah.
2232940	2237500	But John Lee Pettymore is in the body of Kevin
2237500	2240420	who is in all black tactical gear
2240420	2243220	who has a lot of cool stuff,
2243220	2247380	probably like a silencer and like a laser sight
2247380	2249260	and like glow in the dark.
2249260	2250580	Some handcuffs.
2250580	2253300	Use laser cuffs on him.
2253300	2254140	Okay, okay.
2254140	2257700	If I'm fully like tactical, like survival loaded out,
2257740	2258660	I zip tie him.
2258660	2259660	There it is.
2259660	2261340	I just needed you to think.
2261340	2262180	Fuck off.
2262180	2263020	Ah!
2263020	2265140	All right.
2265140	2265980	It's late.
2268980	2271940	As you zip tie his hands,
2271940	2275020	I need whoever has the best alertness or alertness.
2275020	2276500	I got a 70.
2276500	2278340	Clark has the bishop it is.
2280660	2282580	Fuck me, a 73.
2282580	2284500	I don't know if I've passed a role
2284500	2286340	like in the last two episodes.
2286340	2287180	Don't worry.
2287500	2289820	I'm helping the podcast and the storyteller.
2290980	2294340	We're like out of combat essentially at this point.
2294340	2296180	Well, I'm gonna go pick up his gun.
2296180	2297020	Okay, yeah, done.
2297020	2299060	Yeah, I go over to him.
2299060	2300740	Is he face down or face up?
2300740	2304580	Clark, the gun is a little revolver, snub nose fella.
2304580	2308980	And Luke Terence is face up, ass grounded.
2308980	2311900	I go over to him and I just kind of like kick him
2311900	2315340	with my foot and like shove him over,
2315340	2318580	like roll him over to where he's on his stomach.
2318580	2321340	I reach in to his back pocket and grab his wallet
2321340	2322180	and look inside.
2322180	2325020	Hey, hey man, there ain't no need to do that.
2325020	2326460	What do I see inside the wallet?
2326460	2329260	Inside Terence Licker's wallet.
2330820	2334500	You know, he's got a punch card for Subtropolis
2334500	2339500	and he's got his ID and he's got a few credit cards,
2339900	2344540	like four or five credit cards, no debit card,
2344540	2347020	no library card, certainly not.
2347020	2349380	However, he's in Mensa.
2349380	2351020	So he's got a little Mensa ID card.
2351020	2352500	Does he have any cash on him?
2352500	2353460	Cash?
2353460	2358380	Go ahead and roll, roll a D20
2358380	2361060	to see how many dollars are in here.
2361060	2362300	Times 1000.
2362300	2363900	$13.
2363900	2365740	$13,000.
2365740	2369740	So he's got a $5 bill and an $8 bill.
2370740	2375020	No, 13 works out perfectly for you.
2375020	2377580	I open it up, I see there's 13 bucks in there.
2377580	2381460	I take the three ones, like hold it down by his face
2381460	2383340	and I'm like, we're even now.
2383340	2385900	And I like take the $10 bill and like rip it up
2385900	2389620	in front of him and then stick the $3 in my pocket.
2389620	2390700	I look at the guys, I'm like,
2390700	2392820	should we go to the pond now?
2397060	2399100	I'm glad you said that in front of these people.
2399140	2403740	Keith, it seems like maybe more to the mystery.
2403740	2406300	Yeah, sorry, I just, I kinda had.
2406300	2408620	I think we might be able to unravel some more right here.
2408620	2410300	You know, I focused in on the pond
2410300	2412620	and then I focused in on my getting even with this guy.
2412620	2416020	Sure, sure, I understand the $3 was your objective
2416020	2417620	and as soon as that was complete,
2417620	2419140	you're like, let's go, I get it.
2419140	2422380	Once I kinda like get my bearings back,
2422380	2424300	I look down at Terrence, hey,
2424300	2426280	if you can still talk without your teeth,
2426280	2428660	what's up with the bodies, why do you have this?
2428660	2431620	And I show him the picture of me that I found in his truck.
2431620	2435380	You son of a bitch, I ain't talking shit to you.
2435380	2437500	Please, now you say that.
2437500	2439540	I mean, you can roll.
2439540	2440380	Torture.
2442660	2446100	There are torture rules in the Delta Green handbook.
2446100	2448140	Of course there are, it's Delta Green.
2448140	2451820	Yeah, it's very legitimate and it uses willpower.
2451820	2453220	You don't know them offhand,
2453220	2455180	you fucking incompetent keeper.
2455180	2456580	Oh, we don't play Delta Green.
2457100	2457940	I know.
2462380	2466580	And so, Luke, you need to roll
2466580	2470940	either some sort of persuade or law.
2470940	2472500	Okay, I got a pretty good persuade.
2472500	2474060	Or you can go psychotherapy
2474060	2475260	if you wanna like try to turn a mind for it.
2475260	2476980	I got a four on a 70.
2476980	2479640	I ain't talking to you, I ain't giving you shit.
2479640	2481860	I wad up the picture of me and I'm like,
2481860	2483060	well, if you're not gonna talk
2483060	2484940	and I like shove it into his mouth.
2487420	2489980	Can I like talk now?
2489980	2491900	Okay, yeah, I'll talk now.
2491900	2494340	I didn't like having you inside my mouth.
2494340	2495300	Nobody does.
2496260	2498100	Hey, did we take that little bit of carpet
2498100	2500260	that we were shoving down Drew's throat
2501180	2502500	to see where people were?
2502500	2505180	I can't imagine that you didn't take it.
2505180	2506980	I mean, maybe it works on any throat.
2506980	2508900	We could just find out whatever we want.
2508900	2511860	Jesus, keep that in the back pocket.
2511860	2513580	Between that and the watch,
2513580	2516300	we've broken your game wide open, Zach.
2516860	2517900	I gave it to you.
2518780	2519620	Use it.
2521980	2523420	So he spits it out.
2523420	2525180	Am I gonna have to keep going?
2525180	2527620	No, I told you I had talked to you now.
2527620	2529120	What do you want?
2529120	2529960	We're supposed to find you.
2529960	2531860	What are you doing here?
2531860	2532980	We're collecting.
2532980	2534140	What are you doing here?
2534140	2536020	Why do you have a picture of me?
2536020	2539180	And what's this with the bodies and disappearing?
2539180	2540780	Yeah, what do you want with Randy?
2540780	2542860	Okay, the last question
2542860	2544900	and the first question are the same.
2544940	2548220	So I will say that we're collecting.
2548220	2549740	We need more bodies.
2549740	2550860	Daddy needs more bodies.
2550860	2551700	For what?
2551700	2552780	I don't know if you've noticed,
2552780	2556200	but the world is completely off its filter
2556200	2559180	and daddy's gonna make everything better.
2559180	2560620	How's he gonna do that with bodies?
2560620	2561460	He's gonna go back.
2561460	2563020	He's gonna make everything better.
2563020	2567100	Do the bodies get to live after you're done with them?
2567100	2568140	Well, yeah, of course.
2568140	2569840	Everything's gonna go back to normal.
2569840	2571820	We're gonna go back to normal.
2572820	2575740	How are you, hold on, how are you using these bodies?
2575740	2577580	Well, we gotta sacrifice all these bodies
2577580	2580260	so that daddy can go back
2580260	2583500	and make sure everything's normal from here on out, right?
2583500	2585700	So if he goes back and fixes everything,
2585700	2587460	then it won't be this way now.
2587460	2588700	You damn fool.
2588700	2590660	Daddy doesn't wanna take things back to the way they were.
2590660	2592080	Who the fuck are you?
2592080	2594140	Daddy wants to consolidate his power.
2594140	2595820	I'd like to walk up now and say,
2596880	2598060	you keep saying go back.
2598060	2600460	What do you mean by daddy wants to go back?
2600460	2601700	In time.
2602540	2604020	He's doing this with a sacrifice?
2604020	2605260	Well, if we have enough bodies,
2605260	2606700	we'll be able to make it happen.
2606700	2608440	Did daddy explain this to you
2608440	2611580	or is this something that you've learned recently?
2611580	2613820	How do you know about how this is gonna work?
2613820	2615740	Daddy explained it to everyone
2615740	2620740	and everyone at the First Creek family of contention knows
2621620	2625460	we need more bodies so that we can do the sacrifice
2625460	2628740	so that daddy can go back and fix everything.
2628740	2630620	You willing to sacrifice your body?
2630660	2631860	How many bodies you're gonna need?
2631860	2633580	No, I'm just a collector.
2633580	2634500	How many have you got?
2634500	2635320	Me?
2635320	2636160	I'm not winning.
2637580	2638400	But-
2638400	2640860	He incentivized it into some kind of competition?
2640860	2642460	Well, of course you're not gonna collect
2642460	2643840	without a competition.
2643840	2645060	What do you win? What does winner get?
2645060	2646380	Winning gets whatever they want.
2646380	2647620	What do the losers get?
2647620	2649460	Well, the losers still fought the family
2649460	2651180	so ain't nobody really a loser.
2651180	2652820	But do they have to give their bodies?
2652820	2655220	Everybody giving their body, we all gonna die.
2655220	2656500	We're all dying anyway.
2656500	2657980	There ain't no living here.
2657980	2659340	Have you seen contention?
2659340	2660940	There ain't no living here.
2660940	2663980	The only change we have having a real life is going back
2663980	2666020	and daddy can go back and fix everything.
2666020	2667100	If you don't wanna be a part of it,
2667100	2668600	you need to go get on out of here,
2668600	2669960	but we need to keep Keith
2669960	2672860	because Keith is the key that's going back.
2672860	2673900	Expand on that.
2673900	2676060	Daddy needs Keith.
2676060	2678260	So you just believe everything daddy tells you.
2678260	2680900	And John, you look down, Clark, you look down as well,
2680900	2683260	you see this piece of paper that he spit out
2683260	2685660	that Keith Vigna shoved into his mouth
2685660	2689020	is a picture of Keith Vigna.
2689020	2692500	And below it, it says whatever I said earlier,
2692500	2695220	but I'm gonna say, collect alive.
2695220	2697860	I shoved the piece of carpet sample into his mouth
2697860	2699180	and I say, daddy.
2706360	2708620	What the fuck was that?
2708620	2710220	And his eyes get real big
2710220	2713060	and then he starts squirming, horrified.
2713060	2717780	He is extremely, extremely scared
2717780	2719660	of John Lee Pettymore the third.
2719660	2723020	When he looks up and sees John Lee Pettymore
2723020	2726460	after John shoves this piece of carpet into his throat,
2726460	2729020	he freaks out and he's like, you're one of them.
2729020	2730620	How did you get, you're one of them.
2730620	2733180	It's in you, it's in you.
2733180	2734720	See, I think it's in you.
2734720	2736480	I think it's in all of you.
2736480	2737840	What are you doing with Jimmy?
2737840	2740860	As you say that, you hear like a little splash
2740860	2745860	and Jimmy Sanders with his long unkempt hippie hair
2746340	2750020	does the like Bond girl fling out of the water
2750020	2752980	that's in the back of this truck and looks over at you.
2752980	2757120	Hey, number six, you know, extra cucumber.
2758580	2760920	It's not an oil spill, it lives here now.
2765460	2767780	That's basically how Jimmy was before all this.
2767780	2769020	So that's not, you know.
2769340	2772980	Look at Terrence, are you using him to see the stuff?
2772980	2774660	Oh yeah, of course we are.
2774660	2777020	Right, because they use children and crazy people.
2777020	2778060	Good job, Luke.
2779260	2780940	Jimmy, do you see it on us?
2780940	2782980	Oh, and you can't even approach Jimmy
2782980	2785400	without him dipping into the water.
2785400	2787820	As if he sees goo everywhere.
2787820	2790100	No, it's specifically when he's looking at you
2790100	2791560	and I need you to roll sanity.
2791560	2792780	Me? Yes.
2792780	2795140	Thomas, John is so fucked up that your cousin
2795140	2797980	just keeps dunking his head in this water.
2798020	2800860	Dude, 28 on a 25.
2800860	2804700	Oh, you just lose one.
2804700	2806500	But Luke and Joe, if you could take off
2806500	2807900	your headphones real quick.
2813900	2815220	Hey, Thomas.
2815220	2817100	You just lose one sanity.
2817100	2819480	However, you approached Jimmy Sanders
2819480	2822580	who immediately like looks you in the face,
2822580	2827580	gets extremely scared and then dips into the water
2827780	2830500	and as you're turning back,
2830500	2833260	you catch a reflection of yourself
2833260	2837500	in the shotgun side mirror of this truck
2837500	2841540	and there is black ooze dripping
2841540	2843380	out of both of your nostrils,
2843380	2846700	running down your face from both of your eyes,
2846700	2849180	coming out maybe one of the sides of your mouth
2849180	2851980	and running down from both of your ears
2851980	2855080	and then you blink and it is not there
2855080	2857140	and you look like you always do.
2857580	2858420	Fuck.
2864940	2867100	So you guys see Kevin Lee Pettymore
2867100	2869100	take a step back from the truck
2869100	2871080	and like he falls backwards.
2871080	2873300	He lands on his ass.
2873300	2874820	John, you all right?
2874820	2875660	Trip there?
2876580	2878340	I'm walking over to try to help you out.
2878340	2880020	Oh, hey, yeah.
2881420	2884500	Kinda just for a second there out of the corner of my eye,
2885260	2889420	saw the goo running out of all my orifices,
2889420	2893460	so I blinked, it was gone,
2893460	2895860	but it was there real as day.
2895860	2896780	Was it doing anything?
2896780	2898020	Did it move?
2898020	2901860	Just oozing, just oozing,
2901860	2903740	coming out of my nose, holes in my.
2903740	2905260	Should you take a dunk?
2905260	2907640	And I look over at the truck.
2907640	2911380	John's eyes get wide and he nods
2911380	2914740	and he dives into that pool with Jimmy Sanders.
2914740	2916800	You dive into it?
2916800	2920720	I leap and I just body slam into the pool.
2920720	2921680	Yeah, okay.
2921680	2924420	Luke and Joe, I need you to take your headphones off again.
2924420	2925260	Cool, cool, cool.
2931420	2935620	John, as you break into the water,
2935620	2937980	into this puddle that has been formed
2937980	2941340	and teeming with fish in the back of this truck,
2942180	2945500	your head vibrates like it's sizzling
2945500	2950500	and you feel basically in your ears and in your nose,
2950500	2955140	you feel like when your ears are super clogged up
2955140	2958600	and then you pour hydrogen peroxide or something in there
2958600	2962460	and it like bubbles up crazy, like insane bubbles.
2964340	2965740	And all you can hear is like.
2968780	2971300	And you feel it in your nose and it like tickles
2972140	2975180	and there's something inside of your head
2975180	2980180	that is just like throbbing and all of a sudden,
2980700	2982860	you feel yourself rolling.
2982860	2987780	You feel yourself rolling back and forth comfortably.
2988660	2993660	It's a nostalgic feeling and it reminds you of family.
2995320	2998340	It's warmth, it's comfort.
2998340	2999260	You said come.
2999260	3001100	You can feel.
3001100	3002820	You said come for it.
3007020	3007860	Gross.
3010100	3011740	Welcome to Fort come.
3013220	3014040	Okay, shit.
3014040	3019040	So, ew, God, I just keep picturing like Santa Claus' workshop
3022820	3025080	Yeah, cause it's like all the frosting and shit,
3025080	3026140	but it's just gum.
3026980	3031380	It's like a gingerbread house, but it's cum.
3031380	3032580	Instead of peppermints,
3032580	3035100	like there's just cock rings all over it and like.
3035100	3036500	Too far.
3036500	3037780	Oh boy.
3037780	3039840	Yeah, you just feel yourself rolling back and forth
3039840	3042940	and then you realize that you are rolling back and forth
3042940	3044160	in a palm.
3046260	3047100	Okay.
3047100	3049300	And then you lift your head above the water
3049300	3050580	and immediately.
3056980	3059500	The smell is awful.
3059500	3060340	Like a shower.
3060340	3063540	There is a distinct stench.
3063540	3066340	It is fishy, but it is rancid.
3066340	3069120	It is overpoweringly stinky.
3069120	3071420	After Jon lifts his head above the water,
3071420	3076420	you all smell this and it is coming from the truck bed
3076620	3079860	and it fucking reeks.
3079860	3081900	Jon, I need you to roll constitution
3081900	3084220	to not puke on your cousin.
3085100	3087360	Which is lower than my constitution.
3089580	3091180	What's your throw up like?
3091180	3092500	It's nuts and bolts.
3094900	3099120	Yeah, I imagine there's like some synthetic oils in it.
3100860	3103060	Do androids dream of electric barf?
3105060	3106460	You are mostly human.
3106460	3108140	Then it's a mostly human barf,
3108140	3110780	but there is still some motor oil in there.
3110780	3113980	Yeah, that completely adds up for me.
3114580	3116140	But mostly just because you've been drinking motor oil
3116140	3117780	the whole way back to contention.
3117780	3119220	Stop or we're gonna have to stop
3119220	3121000	for you to pee again, Thomas.
3121000	3121900	Oh my.
3121900	3126900	So he just yaks all up in this puddle that has been created.
3127760	3130640	And Jimmy Sanders is, it doesn't live here.
3131980	3136000	He's just got extra meat.
3136000	3139380	And then he's gonna stand up
3139380	3141500	and then he's gonna sit back down.
3141540	3143380	It's a confusing guy, Jimmy Sanders.
3144340	3147700	Hey there, he got a, what the?
3147700	3149620	That man over there, he licked himself,
3149620	3151740	freaked out, jumped in there and started throwing up.
3151740	3154460	What's going, it smelled like shit, y'all been.
3154460	3155860	Other than the presence of that smell,
3155860	3157860	has anything changed at all?
3157860	3159980	Like, can I tell a source of the smell?
3159980	3161620	It's just when he popped up from the water
3161620	3162460	and came from the truck.
3162460	3164100	Then the truck started smelling terrible, yeah.
3164100	3166040	Jimmy, do you see any goo?
3167300	3170060	Oh, Jimmy doesn't just like answer questions.
3170060	3171700	Right, I figured, but.
3171700	3173820	He's just like talking this whole time.
3173820	3178180	He's always talking and he's always just like,
3178180	3180180	yeah, of course you'd have a number one,
3180180	3182740	but like, you can't have that without living here.
3182740	3186020	I mean, the oil is extra tomatoes, but the split,
3186020	3188220	you know, I can't cut it in half for the reasons,
3188220	3189780	you know, he's vegetarian.
3189780	3192540	I'm a pescatarian, but I only eat meat.
3192540	3197200	I look over at Terrence, how do you get,
3197200	3199500	how do you get him to tell you about the ooze?
3199780	3201460	Oh, he just screams normally.
3201460	3203620	Okay, so you don't think there's any around us right now?
3203620	3205060	I mean, it smells, don't it?
3205060	3206540	Something just happened.
3206540	3208100	Does it smell like the ooze?
3208100	3209900	Clearly, your bar just dumped in there
3209900	3211060	because he was trying to avoid it.
3211060	3213980	We couldn't see it, but your friends there is crazy.
3213980	3215100	I want y'all to know that.
3215100	3216660	He could have seen it, he jumped in there,
3216660	3218060	and now it smells, of course it does,
3218060	3220100	because when the fifth gets smelled, it smells like it.
3220100	3221700	I'm gonna yell over to John.
3221700	3222900	John, are you all right?
3222900	3225180	What's going on?
3225180	3226020	You all right?
3226020	3227580	John lifts his head out of the water
3227580	3231820	and smells the smell, sees that Jimmy's not screaming,
3231820	3236820	and he's like, I am now, I'm all right now, maybe.
3237460	3239220	I don't really know how this works.
3239220	3242260	No, it seems tricky, I don't know either.
3242260	3246580	I mean, you're, hey, hey, Keith Vigna, psh,
3246580	3247780	your friend is crazy.
3247780	3250020	The one who's not a cop, Clark.
3250020	3252900	The one who's not a cop, he's crazy.
3252900	3254820	He can see it, he's losing his shit.
3254820	3256420	I don't believe you.
3256860	3258140	How would you know that?
3258140	3259820	Because he saw it, and then he jumped in,
3259820	3260940	and now it smells.
3260940	3263900	When the puddles get teemed, right,
3263900	3265580	they got fish in them, right?
3265580	3267300	But when the fish collect,
3267300	3268740	we're doing collecting of people,
3268740	3271060	fish doing collecting of residue,
3271060	3272900	when the fish collect, it smells.
3272900	3276500	So this smell is from collecting residue.
3278500	3281300	Is it time for me to appear now?
3281300	3285660	And you see Randy Angston in a very nice blue
3285700	3289900	three-piece suit, except for instead of the pants that match,
3289900	3291500	he's wearing sweatpants.
3291500	3294780	Hello, I'm Randy Angst.
3294780	3297220	What do you know about all this?
3297220	3298620	Well, is it safe?
3299660	3301260	What do you know about all this?
3301260	3304420	I'm the one who's scared, you're out here running around.
3304420	3308420	Do you know anything else other than what daddy wants?
3308420	3310100	Who the fuck is daddy?
3310100	3312540	I think it's the pastor.
3312660	3316220	Oh, that fucking piece of shit, little turd nugget.
3316220	3318220	That's the impression we get, yeah.
3318220	3322060	Ever since he lost his family, he's been a real dick.
3322060	3327060	Oh, he lost his, how did he lose his family?
3327740	3329460	He died in a car crash.
3330540	3335540	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no.
3338620	3340260	Hey, yeah, remember?
3340260	3341660	Oh, no.
3341700	3345300	Remember that burning, that burning vehicle
3345300	3347540	with the family inside?
3349100	3352580	I bet it was, his family was kind of burnt up.
3352580	3354900	Didn't we save one of them?
3354900	3357020	Not enough, I guess.
3357020	3360860	I mean, I pulled somebody out of there.
3360860	3361980	I pulled someone out of that.
3361980	3363740	But people perished, right?
3364940	3365780	Yeah, for sure.
3365780	3368300	There's like a wife and maybe a couple kids.
3369300	3372220	Why do you think these things are connected?
3372220	3373820	That happened a couple days ago.
3375940	3377860	Well, just because we hadn't, you know,
3377860	3380540	we weren't getting much of a ruckus out of the pastor
3380540	3383860	until, you know, maybe he could have directly linked us
3383860	3385380	to his family's demise.
3385380	3386740	Terrence, when did his family die?
3386740	3387780	Tell me when his family died.
3387780	3389820	Years and years ago, right?
3389820	3393420	No, it was you guys, and it was a couple days ago.
3393420	3396020	It was right before you skipped town.
3396060	3398980	So-called contention police officers.
3398980	3400260	I believe you murdered three-
3400260	3403300	One thing you need to know is that we did not skip town.
3403300	3405100	Everything we've done between here and now,
3405100	3408180	like the outset of all this and now, is to save this town.
3408180	3410180	And the only thing that's happened since then
3410180	3413060	is that we've lost almost our entire population
3413060	3416260	of contention, and the pastor who's now taken over
3416260	3419060	lost his wife, his daughter, and his son
3419060	3421700	in a car accident that was caused by you
3421700	3423260	and all of your tomfoolery.
3423260	3425020	No, no, no, now wait a minute.
3425060	3429140	We're not the ones gathering up the population's bodies.
3429140	3433140	No, I got, I saved, I saved, I saved the son.
3433140	3435580	I saved the son, I did what I could.
3435580	3438740	No, you must have failed a role there right at the end.
3438740	3440660	I think there was one specific role
3440660	3443180	that would have saved him, and it was right before
3443180	3446180	he took off in the ambulance, and it was a failed role.
3447100	3448380	So that killed a child.
3449420	3453340	And gave us our main enemy for this situation.
3455540	3457060	I look at the other two guys.
3457060	3459300	What are we gonna do with these guys?
3459300	3461460	We can't let him go back to the pastor.
3461460	3463580	Luca is asleep.
3463580	3467180	I think the pain and the shock have gotten to him,
3467180	3471380	and he is eyes closed up against the garage door.
3471380	3474420	And there's a trail of blood now making its way
3474420	3476940	at, it's about halfway down the driveway.
3476940	3479140	I'm gonna go back inside if it's all good to you.
3479140	3480540	It's much more comfortable.
3480540	3482220	So you're not helping out the pastor at all?
3482220	3483580	No, we need you out here, Randy.
3483580	3484580	No, God, no.
3485060	3487580	That cane you had in there, it had a Rubik's Cube on it.
3487580	3489860	Do you have a bunch of different canes?
3489860	3491220	No, that's my cane.
3491220	3493620	Was there ever a tooth one?
3493620	3496940	I love my cane, and I don't like Adam Kane.
3496940	3499780	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
3499780	3502980	A tooth, now I've got plenty in my mouth.
3502980	3505460	Ha, but no, it's a Rubik's Cube.
3505460	3507140	And he hands you a business card.
3507140	3507980	Let me read it.
3507980	3509340	It says that he is the director
3509340	3511700	of the Children's Museum of Mathematics.
3511700	3514460	Yeah, that's not what his business card said last time.
3515300	3517540	The Children's Museum of Mathematics
3517540	3522540	is a location given to us by a patron at the $10 level.
3523420	3524940	David from San Jose.
3524940	3527540	Thanks, David, good job.
3527540	3528380	Thank you, thank you, thank you.
3528380	3529740	The Children's Museum of Mathematics
3529740	3531580	is an underfunded museum,
3531580	3534440	which aims to get kids excited about math.
3534440	3536620	It's mostly puzzles and exhibits
3536620	3538580	about how you can arrange shapes.
3538580	3540260	Did he hand that card to me?
3540260	3542660	Yes, have you not been?
3542660	3545260	Randy, do you have a collection of all these cards?
3545260	3546980	You got a bunch of different ones?
3546980	3548100	Yeah, absolutely.
3548100	3549940	And he reaches in a pocket
3549940	3552220	and pulls out a bunch of business cards
3552220	3554500	that all say Randy Angst,
3554500	3557900	director of the Children's Museum of Mathematics.
3557900	3559460	Randy, do you remember the last time
3559460	3561180	we ran into each other?
3561180	3563660	Keith Vigna, not one for mathematics.
3563660	3566500	I believe you may have pulled me over
3566500	3568220	because I didn't have my lights on
3568220	3569820	about a month and a half ago.
3569820	3570860	That's my bad.
3570860	3572020	No, we're talking about the time
3572020	3573740	you just shit all over your pants
3573740	3574860	just a few days ago.
3574860	3575860	A few days ago?
3575860	3577760	My memory is hopefully not that bad,
3577760	3579420	but the pants that I just shit in
3579420	3582620	about 15 minutes ago are already in the washer.
3582620	3584220	Randy, have you ever been director
3584220	3585900	of the Contention Historical Society?
3585900	3588740	I'm a member, but I didn't,
3588740	3590100	did you ask if I started it?
3590100	3593500	I don't wanna claim that I started it.
3593500	3595940	No, no, I thought that's what your old card said
3595940	3596980	is that you were director.
3596980	3598100	My old card?
3598100	3600380	Yeah, we just ran into you a couple days ago.
3600740	3602240	Back when we were fighting that robot man,
3602240	3603080	remember that?
3603080	3603900	It was a robot.
3603900	3604740	You were staring at the legs.
3604740	3606820	His upper half flew off the window.
3606820	3609320	Randy Yanks is now slowly backing away
3609320	3610160	from the three of you.
3610160	3610980	You were in chess games.
3610980	3615980	And he is going to, if you wouldn't mind,
3617940	3619980	I think I'm just going to,
3619980	3622540	and he's backing into his doorway of his house.
3622540	3624900	Randy, Randy, now we don't mean you no harm.
3624900	3628100	I'd really like to just shut this door.
3628100	3629780	Randy, listen, for one second,
3630020	3631620	you're wearing sweatpants
3631620	3633920	instead of your three piece suit pants.
3633920	3635940	That's cause you shit your pants.
3635940	3638500	Yes, but that's not a crime.
3638500	3640700	I know it's not a crime, but how would we know that
3640700	3643700	unless we had seen you shit your pants in the past?
3643700	3645340	Adds up, but I don't remember it.
3645340	3646180	We know.
3647180	3648680	Roll sanity, everybody.
3652940	3654540	Is 91 good?
3655540	3656660	38, fail.
3656660	3658060	I fail over my power.
3658100	3659820	Yeah, I got bad news for Randy Yanks.
3659820	3661020	I failed over my power.
3662840	3664860	The door isn't quite closed yet.
3666100	3667640	Do we just take one or a D something?
3667640	3668540	No, just one.
3668540	3671640	Well, fellers, it seems like this town is fucked
3671640	3675140	and we might as well just bail on this reality.
3675140	3675980	Later.
3678860	3680400	That's one way we can do this.
3680400	3681680	I don't know if it'll be satisfying.
3681680	3683060	You know, people say we don't get a lot
3683060	3685700	of satisfying conclusions to these plot points,
3685700	3690380	but Luke wrapped up that three single dollar things so fast.
3690380	3691900	All in one, baby.
3691900	3694880	Yeah, that plot point you introduced this episode.
3694880	3695720	Fucking nailed it.
3695720	3697300	It was the last episode, I think.
3698620	3699460	It was tonight.
3699460	3701060	Earlier this evening.
3701060	3706060	As all of you realize, Randy Yanks ain't Randy Yanks.
3706420	3707420	Is Randy Yanks?
3707420	3709420	He's not our Randy Yanks.
3709420	3711620	Exactly, but maybe somebody's Randy Yanks
3711620	3714340	and Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna
3714340	3717540	both roll over their power, lose one sanity,
3717540	3718660	and then Clark goes first.
3718660	3720700	Clark is rushing the door
3720700	3723900	and Joe is hoping that Randy closed it first,
3723900	3726720	but he's rushing the front door to attack Randy.
3726720	3727980	Yeah, let's just do a quick roll.
3727980	3729140	Okay, what kind of roll?
3729140	3729980	Dexterity.
3734140	3739140	The one roll I make tonight.
3740660	3742620	It's a 52 on a 60.
3742620	3743460	Get him.
3743500	3744980	89.
3744980	3745820	Oh yeah.
3745820	3747420	Oh, you're busting in there.
3747420	3749740	I barrel in the door so hard
3749740	3752600	that it knocks him back and onto the ground.
3752600	3754020	And I'm doing like I did to Keith.
3754020	3755860	Oh, no.
3755860	3757100	Just moments before,
3757100	3759500	and I'm throttling him into the ground,
3759500	3764020	saying, you're not a children's museum of mathematics guy.
3764020	3766900	You're a historical society guy.
3766900	3767740	Keith Vigna.
3767740	3770180	I see that and I start looking around
3770180	3773300	and I see the two guys on the ground
3774020	3774860	and Jimmy in the back,
3774860	3777700	and I'm like, this is a trap.
3777700	3779580	Somebody's coming and I get my gun out
3779580	3781140	and I just shoot.
3781140	3783500	I shoot at Terrence.
3783500	3784780	Holy shit.
3784780	3786500	Luca and Jimmy.
3786500	3787780	Holy shit.
3787780	3789700	Should I roll firearms?
3789700	3791460	No, I'm gonna roll.
3791460	3794180	Just like a 50-50 luck, basically.
3794180	3795620	If you're just like unloading a clip
3795620	3797740	around like three people.
3797740	3800540	Yeah, then I'll roll luck for each of them.
3801540	3802580	It won't be 50-50.
3802580	3804300	That'd be insane.
3804300	3808900	It'll be like a 25% chance that it hits any one of them.
3811180	3812060	22.
3812060	3812900	So...
3814620	3815460	Somebody's getting dinged.
3815460	3816700	That's the one we wanna kill.
3816700	3821540	Yep, so D6, we'll do a one and a two is Jimmy Sanders,
3821540	3823980	a three and a four is Fade,
3823980	3827180	and a five and a six is Terrence.
3828340	3829180	Is that a five?
3829220	3831060	It's a three.
3831060	3831900	Yep.
3831900	3832740	Jimmy.
3832740	3833580	No, that's Fade.
3833580	3834420	Fade.
3834420	3835260	Three's Fade.
3835260	3838340	You like fire a couple shots towards Jimmy Sanders
3838340	3840460	and then a couple shots towards Terrence,
3840460	3843260	who's like right next to you, like on the ground.
3843260	3844700	As you're looking at Terrence,
3844700	3847380	you just like hold it up and fire over it, Fade,
3847380	3851740	and go ahead and roll a D10.
3851740	3852580	Nine.
3852580	3853620	Nine?
3853620	3854820	Nine.
3854820	3855740	Oh boy.
3856740	3860340	Clark Marshall, Clark Marshall, Clark Marshall,
3860340	3861180	Clark Marshall here.
3861180	3864260	Clark Bishop rushes into the house of Randy Anks,
3864260	3865620	shoving the door backwards,
3865620	3867460	knocking Randy Anks on his back.
3867460	3870940	Keith Vigna begins unloading his clip into the area,
3870940	3872700	freaking out, his eyes are wide.
3872700	3875460	Johnny, you can see it and he's panicking.
3875460	3878820	And as he's panicking, you can't even tell
3878820	3880540	where he's aiming this gun.
3880540	3882900	And then all of a sudden you just see like
3882900	3884980	the fucking Zapruder film.
3885100	3888820	Luca, Fade, Fajevic's head,
3888820	3893820	and the garage is a Kai Twombly painting immediately.
3893940	3898940	Just abstract art on the garage door of Randy Anks
3899060	3903460	as the shoulders slump off to the right
3903460	3907140	with the momentum of this gunshot.
3907140	3912140	And the blood now starts a second path down the driveway,
3913140	3916100	but the second one is moving much, much quicker
3916100	3918740	and it is much wider and thicker
3918740	3922180	with the blood of Luca, Fade, Fajevic
3922180	3927180	as he dies errant bullet from an insane Keith Vigna
3927540	3928820	who turns to you.
3928820	3932300	And I need John Lee Pettymore, Thomas, sorry,
3932300	3934300	and Joe to take your headphones off.
3934300	3939300	As Keith Vigna turns to John Lee Pettymore the third,
3941220	3945740	you see that this black viscous ooze is pouring
3945740	3949940	out of his nose and it is dripping from his mouth
3949940	3953660	and it is running down his cheeks from his eyes
3953660	3957700	and from his ears, it is going underneath his shirt.
3957700	3961060	From his ears, it is going underneath his shirt.
3967580	3970260	I look back over at him and I point my gun at him
3970260	3972620	and I say, get back in the water.
3974300	3975140	At me?
3975140	3976100	Yeah.
3976100	3978740	Aw, all right, and he does so.
3979620	3984620	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
3984940	3985980	Oh, all right.
3985980	3987580	And me, all right.
3990620	3991620	Holy shit.
4008740	4013740	Am I the only one trying to pull over?
4015620	4020620	How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?
4026500	4030420	There's nobody home, nobody home, nobody home.
4038780	4039620	Bye.
4039620	4040460	Bye.
