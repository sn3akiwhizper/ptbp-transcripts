WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.120
It's your moon howling and scowling.

00:06.120 --> 00:10.400
Pepperoni with the side of extra cheese wulf the dog.

00:10.400 --> 00:14.660
The moistest DJ this side of the solar highway.

00:14.660 --> 00:22.480
And I am a-woo-ing at you live from 694.2 PTBP, the greatest radio station that ever

00:22.480 --> 00:23.480
did.

00:23.480 --> 00:27.280
Now lets move on to the greatest things y'all ever did.

00:27.280 --> 00:28.960
Write me fan mail.

00:28.960 --> 00:35.140
This week's howlin with wulf is from at black goat underscore m10 who instagrammed about

00:35.140 --> 00:38.160
the show and tagged at pretending pod.

00:38.160 --> 00:41.800
What a super cool way to let your friends know you're a freak.

00:41.800 --> 00:44.880
He writes greetings Mr. Wolf.

00:44.880 --> 00:48.480
Pretty new listener and first time howler here.

00:48.480 --> 00:49.480
Great show.

00:49.480 --> 00:56.160
I've not really been into RPGs before but I really enjoy the gangs escapades and contention

00:56.160 --> 00:57.160
and the city.

00:57.360 --> 00:59.040
Keep up the good work.

00:59.040 --> 01:01.800
Big shout out to Victor for sending me your way.

01:01.800 --> 01:06.280
Appreciative howls from Mattias in Sweden.

01:06.280 --> 01:11.480
Mattias are you telling me that THE Victor sent you?

01:11.480 --> 01:13.200
What did he tell you?

01:13.200 --> 01:15.360
Who do you work for?

01:15.360 --> 01:20.700
Mattias you're on thin ice buddy and you better watch your back.

01:20.700 --> 01:26.280
And you tell Victor tell him that wulf says hello.

01:26.400 --> 01:31.800
If you want to write up something for your wulf to howl tag at pretending pod on twitter.

01:31.800 --> 01:38.540
Tag at pretending pod on instagram like Mattias or tag at pretending to be people on facebook.

01:38.540 --> 01:44.960
Wolf and his producer haven't spent a single dime on advertising so y'all all here because

01:44.960 --> 01:50.420
of words in mouths or words in posts or words in comments sections.

01:50.420 --> 01:53.040
The point is words are powerful.

01:53.040 --> 01:59.880
Please use yours to share this show with your friends, your co-workers, your grandparents

01:59.880 --> 02:01.640
and step cousins.

02:01.640 --> 02:04.920
And as a reward for your sharing I'll do two things.

02:04.920 --> 02:11.540
One, I might choose you to submit a howling with wulf and two I might and definitely always

02:11.540 --> 02:14.380
do put the links in the show notes.

02:14.380 --> 02:22.520
And while you're posting on them socials about 694.2 PTBP keep them ear holes open and receiving

02:22.520 --> 02:24.480
my dulcet tones.

02:24.480 --> 02:27.360
It's time for the news.

02:27.360 --> 02:33.120
Last time the field team at City Action News showed the good people of TikTok a glimpse

02:33.120 --> 02:39.660
into the calzone on their way to a potential story from a woman named Kaylee Silver.

02:39.660 --> 02:43.680
What they found was the scene of a gruesome homicide.

02:43.680 --> 02:48.760
After watching footage from the Furbo it's clear that Kaylee Silver walked over to her

02:48.760 --> 02:54.600
fridge, cracked a beer and her friend Kaylee Gold's head unnaturally snapped toward the

02:54.600 --> 03:00.820
kitchen before this differently dispositioned Kaylee Gold lunged at the apartments resident

03:00.820 --> 03:02.200
Kaylee Silver.

03:02.200 --> 03:08.320
The attack took place out of view behind the kitchen counter but it seems Kaylee Silver

03:08.320 --> 03:13.760
stabbed her friend repeatedly in the neck with her broken beer bottle until Kaylee Gold's

03:13.760 --> 03:16.320
head was all but decapitated.

03:16.320 --> 03:22.160
Thankfully for this story the Cannes crew called the city cops, made statements and

03:22.160 --> 03:26.320
headed off to cleanse their palates with a drink at the foundry.

03:26.320 --> 03:32.280
Taking us there now is a bop that don't stop, good shit that don't quit, an anthem for the

03:32.280 --> 03:33.520
handsome.

03:33.520 --> 03:38.560
It's Altagirl with My Life is Great and It's All My Phone.

03:46.320 --> 04:15.360
And it's all mine, cause my life is great and it's all my phone.

04:15.360 --> 04:18.000
So why would we do a season one name?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.940
Everyone from season one is dead to this podcast, Luke.

04:20.940 --> 04:22.960
We are moving on, this is season two.

04:22.960 --> 04:26.880
Dude, Thomas, ask me anything about season one.

04:26.880 --> 04:27.880
What's season one?

04:27.880 --> 04:31.400
I don't remember.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.080
Welcome back to season two of Pretending to be People.

04:34.080 --> 04:39.600
If you got into this podcast because of season one, thank you, but honestly, that shit is

04:39.600 --> 04:41.560
over and done.

04:41.560 --> 04:50.280
And this is a new era of excellence and groundbreaking podcast roleplay, so fucking get your two

04:50.280 --> 04:53.480
tight britches on, which is a reference to nothing.

04:53.480 --> 04:57.920
If you listen to season one...

04:57.920 --> 04:58.920
Stop listening right now.

04:58.920 --> 04:59.920
Stop.

04:59.920 --> 05:00.920
Yeah, you need to stop.

05:00.920 --> 05:01.920
Cut that out.

05:01.920 --> 05:04.760
Nope, nope, nope, nope, keep going.

05:04.760 --> 05:08.660
The britches this, oh, I feel like I'm, am I clipping for you guys?

05:08.660 --> 05:09.660
A little bit.

05:09.660 --> 05:10.660
I feel very loud.

05:10.660 --> 05:11.660
I'll turn you down.

05:11.660 --> 05:12.700
Turn me down a little bit.

05:12.700 --> 05:13.900
I'll just talk louder.

05:13.900 --> 05:15.780
Oh, the cats, the cats going in the pod box.

05:15.780 --> 05:17.020
Cat in the pod box.

05:17.020 --> 05:18.020
I will say main difference...

05:18.020 --> 05:20.480
She might knock the pod box off the couch.

05:20.480 --> 05:25.620
After listening to the edited version of the first episode of this season.

05:25.620 --> 05:29.020
Yeah, like edited, once it was edited, we were funny and good.

05:29.020 --> 05:30.020
Exactly.

05:30.020 --> 05:31.020
That was the big difference I noticed.

05:31.020 --> 05:33.820
But after listening to that, huge differences.

05:33.820 --> 05:36.560
The britches are going to be small this year.

05:36.560 --> 05:37.560
This years.

05:37.560 --> 05:38.560
This years.

05:39.560 --> 05:41.560
Oh right, they were big in that thing that doesn't exist.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.560
They were big last time and now they're small.

05:43.560 --> 05:46.560
Hey Zach, are they coming out of the f***ing world right now?

05:46.560 --> 05:47.560
No.

05:47.560 --> 05:48.560
Oh, okay.

05:48.560 --> 05:49.560
Nevermind.

05:49.560 --> 05:52.560
Which is a reference to nothing.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.560
Zach is currently...

05:53.560 --> 05:54.560
That cat is going to leave.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.560
Zach is, yeah, aggressively kissing our cat.

05:56.560 --> 05:59.560
Aggressively kissing the top of Niko Case's head.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.560
And the first two times she was like, yeah, sure.

06:01.560 --> 06:04.560
And then the fifth time she was like, I'm not going to sit on this f***ing couch with

06:04.560 --> 06:05.560
you anymore.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.560
You lost cat privilege.

06:07.560 --> 06:12.560
So obviously I know the answer to this, but Joe, where exactly did we leave off last time?

06:12.560 --> 06:15.560
Oh dude, you should have seen the crazy s*** that I saw.

06:15.560 --> 06:20.560
A girl killed another girl in an apartment and it was messed up.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.560
And we were all kind of exasperated by it.

06:22.560 --> 06:27.560
And so Cal Colorado asked us to go to the foundry to maybe wind down.

06:27.560 --> 06:33.560
Which is not a reference to the old Joplin, Missouri music venue.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.560
It's a reference to what, Zach?

06:35.560 --> 06:37.560
Oh, it's a reference to what, Thomas?

06:37.560 --> 06:40.560
I don't remember exactly, but isn't it a newsman's bar?

06:40.560 --> 06:43.560
I believe it's a bar specifically for newsman's.

06:43.560 --> 06:44.560
That's right.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.560
I remember the whole thing.

06:46.560 --> 06:48.560
I knew the whole time I knew that.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.560
So, vroom vroom?

06:50.560 --> 06:51.560
Vroom vroom.

06:51.560 --> 06:52.560
Vroom vroom.

06:54.560 --> 07:00.560
Julius Summers pulls into the parking lot of the foundry.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.560
Yeah, where's the foundry located, Thomas?

07:02.560 --> 07:04.560
What kind of bar is this?

07:04.560 --> 07:12.560
It's got dive bar aesthetics, but much like Cal Colorado's house, there are pictures all over the walls of local news people.

07:12.560 --> 07:18.560
And it's kind of maybe equidistant downtown from the three different local news stations.

07:18.560 --> 07:24.560
And so they all come and relax and unwind there and talk shop afterwards.

07:24.560 --> 07:27.560
Are there any TVs on the walls at all?

07:27.560 --> 07:33.560
Are they showing the news at this place or is it specifically to unwind away from that?

07:33.560 --> 07:37.560
I think they are. I think they never play sports, just the news.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.560
How many news channels are in the city?

07:39.560 --> 07:41.560
He just said there are three.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.560
Okay, there's three TVs then.

07:43.560 --> 07:50.560
I think the foundry is in an older building downtown, but just absolutely always in the shadow of these skyscrapers.

07:50.560 --> 07:56.560
We're in the downtown railroad intersect.

07:56.560 --> 08:01.560
I love it. It's right where the train rolls by and there's a...

08:01.560 --> 08:03.560
They do train shots.

08:03.560 --> 08:05.560
Yeah, of course they do train shots.

08:05.560 --> 08:14.560
So pretty much every time this foundry is rumbling with the train that is basically right outside its back door.

08:14.560 --> 08:21.560
There's just a shitload of attractive people in good suits getting fucking hammered.

08:21.560 --> 08:23.560
And the trains come by a lot.

08:23.560 --> 08:29.560
That's one of the reasons that they chose this place because it's very hard to overhear the conversation like anybody else is having.

08:29.560 --> 08:33.560
You have to lean in close. It's a great place to protect your sources.

08:33.560 --> 08:41.560
In your mind, is this place filled with producers and talent or is my ilk of the camera man and crew there?

08:41.560 --> 08:45.560
Everyone comes to the foundry. We're all friends at the foundry.

08:45.560 --> 08:48.560
Cullerton, KY3, any of the other ones?

08:49.560 --> 08:59.560
I don't think we're referencing specific networks, but it would definitely be the local ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, local anchor people all hanging out there.

08:59.560 --> 09:05.560
Except it's CAN, NNN, Nightly News Now.

09:05.560 --> 09:07.560
ETC is there.

09:07.560 --> 09:09.560
ETC, which is...

09:09.560 --> 09:11.560
Ethical...

09:11.560 --> 09:13.560
This is going to be like PBS and nobody watches it.

09:13.560 --> 09:14.560
Ethical...

09:14.560 --> 09:15.560
Television.

09:15.560 --> 09:17.560
Television channel.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.560
Joe, did you do one?

09:23.560 --> 09:25.560
Yeah, now that we said them all.

09:25.560 --> 09:27.560
RBQ. You guys have fun.

09:27.560 --> 09:30.560
It's sponsored by Arby's and it's barbecue.

09:30.560 --> 09:33.560
Barbecue. Yeah, Royal Broadcasting.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.560
Quarterly.

09:35.560 --> 09:37.560
They only air.

09:39.560 --> 09:41.560
Anyway...

09:42.560 --> 09:45.560
I speedily pull into...

09:45.560 --> 09:47.560
Who packed the ostrich?

09:47.560 --> 09:50.560
I screech into the parking lot of the foundry.

09:50.560 --> 09:52.560
Does Beck say that?

09:52.560 --> 09:54.560
Unless Julius goes...

09:57.560 --> 10:02.560
Julius pulls in, as any normal person would, into a parking spot.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.560
But as he's doing it, he goes...

10:04.560 --> 10:09.560
And then he kind of looks around at the other two and sees Cal is not laughing.

10:09.560 --> 10:12.560
No, Cal is holding onto the oh shit handle.

10:12.560 --> 10:15.560
And is clutching at his chest.

10:15.560 --> 10:22.560
Keep in mind throughout these interactions of the sights you just saw at the apartment.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.560
The high rise that you were just at.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.560
Yeah, I bet you we land in silence.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.560
I bet you we pull in a little somber.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.560
I was going to mention, I don't think...

10:31.560 --> 10:33.560
He would not bring his camera in here.

10:33.560 --> 10:36.560
I think that this is a sacred place that he knows not to film.

10:36.560 --> 10:37.560
Nice.

10:37.560 --> 10:39.560
And that's a very out of character for him.

10:39.560 --> 10:40.560
So you guys walk across...

10:40.560 --> 10:43.560
This is like where the witches and the witch hunters meet.

10:44.560 --> 10:48.560
There are as many people outside smoking as there are inside.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.560
Also smoking?

10:50.560 --> 10:51.560
Yes.

10:51.560 --> 10:54.560
This is a smoking bar, but it's a nice day.

10:57.560 --> 11:01.560
It's a cool evening from an oppressively hot, hot day.

11:01.560 --> 11:04.560
The humidity kind of dies off into the night.

11:04.560 --> 11:09.560
And you've got kind of a cool summer evening as you guys walk across this gravel parking lot.

11:09.560 --> 11:15.560
And head around back to the entrance of the foundry on the train track side.

11:15.560 --> 11:18.560
A train is currently finishing up.

11:18.560 --> 11:22.560
It's bustling through this back area.

11:22.560 --> 11:29.560
And you see a server is haphazardly making their way through the smokers outside with train shots.

11:29.560 --> 11:31.560
He's yelling, train shots!

11:31.560 --> 11:33.560
Who had the train shots?

11:33.560 --> 11:35.560
We got a whole mess of them here.

11:35.560 --> 11:40.560
Cal just like silently takes one off the tray and downs it and puts it back on the tray.

11:40.560 --> 11:46.560
Julius grabs one, takes it, and then puts two dollars down on the tray.

11:46.560 --> 11:47.560
Nice.

11:47.560 --> 11:51.560
Which train shots are specifically a special here at the foundry.

11:51.560 --> 11:55.560
It is a single dollar for a shot of whiskey.

11:55.560 --> 11:56.560
Whisky.

11:56.560 --> 11:57.560
Whisky.

11:57.560 --> 12:01.560
When the train toots its horn as it drives by.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.560
Scoot! Scoot!

12:03.560 --> 12:04.560
Oh god.

12:04.560 --> 12:08.560
If it's fucking dollar whiskey, we're talking Old Crow or worse.

12:08.560 --> 12:09.560
Oh, it's Old Grandad.

12:09.560 --> 12:10.560
Brown Derby Select.

12:10.560 --> 12:11.560
It's Old Grandad.

12:11.560 --> 12:12.560
It's Old Grandad.

12:12.560 --> 12:13.560
Oh yeah.

12:13.560 --> 12:17.560
Orange bottle label.

12:17.560 --> 12:25.560
And you set this down and the server looks at Cal Colorado with a certain appreciation as he carries on with his job.

12:25.560 --> 12:27.560
I think he knows to just add it to Cal's tab.

12:27.560 --> 12:28.560
Nice.

12:28.560 --> 12:38.560
Julius did put the two dollars down on his tray even though he knew that those were not poured out for Cal and Julius.

12:38.560 --> 12:44.560
Immediately you hear him as he walks over to a group who's calling him over with the train shots.

12:44.560 --> 12:48.560
He's reassuring them like, yeah, yeah, no, I'll be right back, I'll be right back.

12:48.560 --> 12:57.560
And their understanding after seeing the looks on the pained faces of Cal Colorado, Julius Summers, and Beck Wilder.

12:57.560 --> 12:59.560
Probably like we recognize.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.560
Are they just like local news crew?

13:01.560 --> 13:03.560
Yeah, it's just another local news crew.

13:03.560 --> 13:11.560
They hold up their shots to you as they all wait on the other two shots to come which come quickly and you're all able to.

13:11.560 --> 13:15.560
Beck takes his head off and does an exaggerated bow and puts it back on.

13:15.560 --> 13:19.560
Guys, this is my first time in here.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.560
I'm very excited.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.560
I've heard a lot about it.

13:23.560 --> 13:26.560
This is the first thing that maybe like brightened Cal's face in a while.

13:26.560 --> 13:30.560
Like he gives a very knowing look to Beck.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.560
Well, we have a first timer here.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.560
I think you know what that means, Beck.

13:34.560 --> 13:38.560
We exchange a look and you see a big smile on Beck looking at you.

13:38.560 --> 13:43.560
Are you thinking like we're going to do the full set up like now?

13:43.560 --> 13:49.560
Maggie doesn't let any first timers in without putting them through the printing press.

13:49.560 --> 13:53.560
Oh, Julius, my man.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.560
You're going to have fun tonight, dude.

13:55.560 --> 13:56.560
It's going to be good for you.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.560
You're going to want to shake off what we saw earlier.

13:58.560 --> 14:02.560
You're going to forget all about that weird horrible homebrew murder.

14:02.560 --> 14:08.560
I mean, I don't know that I'll forget about that anytime soon, but...

14:08.560 --> 14:14.560
No, the images will haunt you for the rest of your life.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.560
But we can obliterate them temporarily.

14:17.560 --> 14:18.560
The printing press?

14:18.560 --> 14:19.560
You'll see.

14:19.560 --> 14:24.560
Julius starts walking faster and wants to be the first one in there

14:24.560 --> 14:30.560
because he's stoked to see what the hell the printing press is.

14:30.560 --> 14:33.560
Do you think that you and I have a booth that we haunt?

14:33.560 --> 14:34.560
Probably, yeah.

14:34.560 --> 14:35.560
I think that'd be cool.

14:35.560 --> 14:41.560
Julius has done his research asking his uncle all about these guys,

14:41.560 --> 14:43.560
so he knows which booth it is.

14:43.560 --> 14:47.560
What?

14:47.560 --> 14:51.560
So Julius goes and sits down in the booth that you guys usually go sit down in.

14:51.560 --> 14:54.560
Do you go sneak in right before Beck gets there?

14:54.560 --> 14:56.560
No, I'm just leading the way.

14:56.560 --> 14:59.560
I'm just going and sitting down and turning around like,

14:59.560 --> 15:01.560
look what I know.

15:01.560 --> 15:02.560
Hey, that's the one we always sit at.

15:02.560 --> 15:05.560
That's weird, dude. Cool.

15:05.560 --> 15:09.560
Hanging Wes Anderson-style directly center frame of the booth

15:09.560 --> 15:17.560
is an old picture of Cal from the night after his first television broadcast

15:17.560 --> 15:19.560
as a head news anchor.

15:19.560 --> 15:24.560
And it's beautifully framed in this old oak wooden frame

15:24.560 --> 15:26.560
and is sitting gloriously.

15:26.560 --> 15:27.560
He looks like a kid.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.560
The suit's wearing him.

15:29.560 --> 15:32.560
Yeah, Cal sits purposely with us back to that.

15:32.560 --> 15:33.560
In what way?

15:33.560 --> 15:36.560
When people look at it, do they see your face next to your face?

15:36.560 --> 15:42.560
No, what they're going to see is a much younger, more handsome man

15:42.560 --> 15:47.560
with a huge smile on his face next to that aged 30 years

15:47.560 --> 15:50.560
and looking absolutely miserable tonight.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.560
It does have that effect that those are contrasted,

15:52.560 --> 15:55.560
but he's not trying to do it as a power move or anything.

15:55.560 --> 15:57.560
He just doesn't want to catch sight of it.

15:57.560 --> 15:58.560
Sure, sure, sure.

15:58.560 --> 16:03.560
As Julius slides into the booth, he's not saying anything

16:03.560 --> 16:05.560
but wiggling with excitement.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.560
He's wanted to do this for so long.

16:07.560 --> 16:11.560
Just be a producer and be part of the news and be able to get into this place.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.560
He is so fucking stoked.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.560
Julius, if you wiggle like that during the printing press,

16:15.560 --> 16:17.560
you could lose a finger.

16:20.560 --> 16:21.560
Printing press.

16:21.560 --> 16:23.560
I want to find out what it is.

16:23.560 --> 16:25.560
Your research didn't tell you what it is.

16:25.560 --> 16:28.560
My uncle would not tell me.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.560
That makes sense.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.560
It's kind of a closely guarded secret around here.

16:31.560 --> 16:33.560
I don't think that anybody goes out there

16:33.560 --> 16:35.560
just telling other people about it, you know?

16:35.560 --> 16:38.560
They never do, if they want to live.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.560
Only kidding.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.560
It's a process that happens in three steps.

16:43.560 --> 16:48.560
The first step, you are laid across the bar

16:48.560 --> 16:51.560
and your belly is exposed.

16:51.560 --> 16:55.560
Julius pulls his shirt up as he lays on the table

16:55.560 --> 16:57.560
and then realizes what was said,

16:57.560 --> 16:59.560
and then he goes and sits back down again.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.560
Tell them the second part.

17:01.560 --> 17:05.560
Well, this is kind of like your last moment of choice here,

17:05.560 --> 17:07.560
but you get to decide what liquor you want.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.560
Once you're laying on the bar with your shirt up?

17:10.560 --> 17:11.560
Uh-huh.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.560
So what would be your choice if you said your favorite liquor?

17:14.560 --> 17:15.560
Tequila.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.560
Ooh, that's a bad choice.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.560
Right on.

17:21.560 --> 17:25.560
The third step is more tequila than you've ever had in your life

17:25.560 --> 17:31.560
with hungry news crews eagerly licking it off your midriff.

17:31.560 --> 17:33.560
Oh, God.

17:34.560 --> 17:39.560
As Maggie, the hardened barkeep, pours a bottle into your mouth.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.560
Great name, by the way.

17:42.560 --> 17:46.560
So the tequila gets poured into my mouth and...

17:46.560 --> 17:47.560
And your belly button.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.560
On my belly button.

17:49.560 --> 17:53.560
And they let the older interns just absolutely go at you.

17:53.560 --> 17:55.560
The older interns!

18:00.560 --> 18:03.560
So at this point you're probably asking what's in it for you.

18:05.560 --> 18:07.560
The deep respect that comes.

18:07.560 --> 18:15.560
I spent a lot of my time in college practicing for this day.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.560
Oh, you've had a lot of people lick you.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.560
I wish.

18:19.560 --> 18:20.560
Oh.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.560
Has anyone licked you?

18:22.560 --> 18:26.560
Julius gets up from the booth and walks over to the bar with his...

18:26.560 --> 18:30.560
While he's like untucking his shirt from his pants.

18:30.560 --> 18:34.560
His all-tan suit.

18:36.560 --> 18:38.560
I thought you were going to describe your body and I was like,

18:38.560 --> 18:40.560
he strikes me as a very pale man.

18:40.560 --> 18:42.560
He's pretty pale, yeah.

18:42.560 --> 18:46.560
You see a trunk of a woman in a denim vest with long...

18:46.560 --> 18:48.560
A vest of a woman in a denim trunk.

18:48.560 --> 18:52.560
And in a long braid down the back of her hair.

18:52.560 --> 18:56.560
She clinks a bell above her head.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.560
And she's like...

19:00.560 --> 19:02.560
Hot off the press.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.560
Hot off the presses.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.560
Oh, that's right.

19:08.560 --> 19:13.560
We got a newbie over at City Action News.

19:13.560 --> 19:15.560
Come on down.

19:16.560 --> 19:23.560
Everyone, give it up for Julius Summers.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.560
He's in for the printing press.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.560
Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang.

19:27.560 --> 19:29.560
And the entire crowd...

19:29.560 --> 19:32.560
In circles. All the smokers come inside when they hear the bell.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.560
And immediately jackets come off.

19:34.560 --> 19:37.560
Ties are loosened. Top buttons are undone.

19:37.560 --> 19:39.560
And these very dorky...

19:39.560 --> 19:42.560
You see the interns start circling.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.560
And they all look like Jonah from Veep.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.560
And Julius...

19:48.560 --> 19:52.560
Julius is laying on the bar with his shirt kind of pulled up.

19:52.560 --> 19:54.560
Exposing his stomach.

19:54.560 --> 20:00.560
And then one of the Jonah interns just rips all of his upper clothing off.

20:00.560 --> 20:08.560
printing press!

20:08.560 --> 20:11.560
And the chants fade away.

20:11.560 --> 20:14.560
Much like Julius's memories.

20:14.560 --> 20:17.560
From the entire night.

20:17.560 --> 20:23.560
Beck and Cow, however, don't get printing pressed by a bunch of rabid interns.

20:23.560 --> 20:28.560
And therefore are able to keep their wits in their brain helmets for the evening.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.560
Let's go check that out.

20:30.560 --> 20:34.560
Hey, thanks so much for listening to Pretending to Be People.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.560
Probably means you're fucking cool.

20:36.560 --> 20:45.560
We've got a very special guest on today's episode of Pretending to Be People.

20:45.560 --> 20:50.560
I had an idea in my head when we were discussing the recording of Season 2.

20:50.560 --> 20:56.560
Joe and I had talked about who his character would interact with the most.

20:56.560 --> 20:59.560
And your answer to that was...

20:59.560 --> 21:01.560
Mother.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.560
The answer was mother.

21:03.560 --> 21:09.560
I think you specifically told me I can't have dead parents this time.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.560
Well, not yet.

21:11.560 --> 21:14.560
Not yet, exactly.

21:14.560 --> 21:24.560
And when you said mom, immediately I thought, well, let's get our podcast dad to come on and play Beck Wilder's mom.

21:24.560 --> 21:28.560
It's Scott Norwood is back, baby!

21:28.560 --> 21:30.560
Thank you very much for having me back on.

21:30.560 --> 21:35.560
This isn't the first time I've been called a mother, but at least the circumstances are different.

21:35.560 --> 21:39.560
Well, we really appreciate you coming on.

21:39.560 --> 21:45.560
For those of you who are just hearing Scott on Pretending to Be People for the first time for some fucking reason.

21:45.560 --> 21:51.560
Scott is my parasocial RPG mentor.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.560
He didn't know that he was my mentor.

21:54.560 --> 22:02.560
But listening to his podcast that he does with Matt Sanderson and Paul Fricker, good friends of Jackson Elias,

22:02.560 --> 22:08.560
truly developed me into the GM that I am today.

22:08.560 --> 22:14.560
And I am super appreciative of all the lessons I've learned listening to their podcast over the years.

22:14.560 --> 22:19.560
Oh, blimey. I'm still amazed that anyone even listens to it, let alone learns.

22:20.560 --> 22:25.560
Scott, before I was ever aware of who you were, I knew that Zach listened to your podcast,

22:25.560 --> 22:30.560
and you answered some questions for him one time, and he was so excited and told us all about it.

22:30.560 --> 22:35.560
And that was way before there was ever a glimmer of hope of meeting you, let alone playing with you.

22:35.560 --> 22:40.560
Oh, yeah. We weren't even talking about recording a podcast, but I was running Hell in Texas,

22:40.560 --> 22:47.560
which is a scenario that you wrote for the book The Things We Leave Behind by Stigine Fox Publishing.

22:47.560 --> 22:53.560
And that's a great book, and your scenario in it is so terrifying and awesome.

22:54.560 --> 22:59.560
So I posted some questions on the subreddit, and you yourself came in and answered them,

22:59.560 --> 23:02.560
and I lost my fucking shit, Scott.

23:07.560 --> 23:14.560
I waste half my life on Reddit. It is my main time sink, and I am not proud of that.

23:15.560 --> 23:22.560
Well, that time sink made this nerd super happy and validated many, many years ago, so thank you for that.

23:22.560 --> 23:28.560
Some might say this podcast wouldn't exist without you, Scott. You gave him the hope, the drive.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.560
Oh, it's all my fault now, is it?

23:32.560 --> 23:34.560
We have to pin it on somebody.

23:35.560 --> 23:49.560
I would like to take us to the home of Beck and Kim Wilder as Ramona scoots her cat.

23:52.560 --> 23:56.560
Zach has a cat food bowl that is one of those ones that's like a maze.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.560
Yeah, it keeps Ramona nice and...

23:58.560 --> 23:59.560
But it kind of becomes a game.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.560
Smart, yeah.

24:02.560 --> 24:08.560
Yeah, she grabs each piece individually and then eats it out of her own paw, which is rad.

24:09.560 --> 24:11.560
But noisy, I imagine.

24:11.560 --> 24:14.560
Quite noisy. I'm going to move it into the back room.

24:17.560 --> 24:23.560
I barely get through a recording session without one of my cats running into the room and screaming like a seagull,

24:23.560 --> 24:26.560
or jumping all over things and knocking shit over.

24:27.560 --> 24:28.560
Yep.

24:28.560 --> 24:32.560
My cats are named Chaos and Anarchy and it's with good reason.

24:32.560 --> 24:33.560
That's great.

24:35.560 --> 24:40.560
Beck Wilder has had a brutal day.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.560
Started off fine.

24:42.560 --> 24:47.560
Woke up around 2 p.m. in your tighty-whities, in your messy bedroom.

24:49.560 --> 24:52.560
Headed off, shot a segment out on a farm.

24:52.560 --> 24:55.560
He had a rough evening? Was it evening?

24:55.560 --> 25:02.560
Yeah, it was a rough evening. You were called out for a potential story that was...

25:02.560 --> 25:05.560
We weren't even 100% sure what we were going out there for.

25:05.560 --> 25:07.560
And what did you find?

25:07.560 --> 25:09.560
Oh man, it wasn't good.

25:09.560 --> 25:15.560
It was a terrible, terrible crime scene, including a partially severed head.

25:15.560 --> 25:16.560
Yeah.

25:16.560 --> 25:20.560
That wasn't what Beck was thinking was going to happen that day.

25:20.560 --> 25:25.560
Yeah, I mean, a severed head is bad enough. A partially severed head sounds worse.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.560
Yeah, it's a lot worse.

25:31.560 --> 25:33.560
Just holding on.

25:33.560 --> 25:34.560
Just a little hinge.

25:36.560 --> 25:38.560
Beck isn't in the greatest headspace.

25:38.560 --> 25:43.560
He's now just gotten back from the foundry where he had a nice night trying to drink his troubles away.

25:43.560 --> 25:47.560
Are you feeling a little loose? You feeling a little warm in the face?

25:47.560 --> 25:49.560
Beck always feels loose.

25:49.560 --> 25:56.560
He's maybe a little bit looser than normal, but he kind of lives in an equilibrium of inebriation.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.560
A loose state. I like that.

25:59.560 --> 26:10.560
So as you arrive home, it's late at night. It's 1130 PM, maybe even midnight, which is about as late in the night as you can get.

26:11.560 --> 26:13.560
Before it starts becoming morning.

26:13.560 --> 26:14.560
That's right.

26:15.560 --> 26:31.560
Kim Wilder has the home to herself. Her son is a mid 30s field cameraman for City Action News, and he is still living in your house, Kim.

26:33.560 --> 26:34.560
For now.

26:36.560 --> 26:40.560
What is Kim Wilder up to on a random Saturday evening?

26:40.560 --> 26:47.560
I think she's sitting there on the sofa, knitting and watching television.

26:47.560 --> 26:53.560
The sound is way down on the TV and there's just the clack, clack, clack of knitting needles.

26:53.560 --> 26:58.560
And somehow she is managing to make knitting look angry.

27:00.560 --> 27:09.560
Out of the corner of her eyes, she just keeps darting her eyes over and stabbing them into the corner where Beck keeps his camera equipment,

27:09.560 --> 27:20.560
which is not there at the time, but there's like a whole corner of this room that is specifically set up to house Beck's livelihood.

27:20.560 --> 27:26.560
Oh, yeah. You can tell exactly where it is just by all the scuff marks and the skirting board and the floor tiles.

27:29.560 --> 27:36.560
And the last you saw Beck, it was maybe even yesterday, because today you knew that he was in his bedroom.

27:36.560 --> 27:44.560
You knew that he, you know, had been sleeping in, but you went to knock on his door for tea or snack or he wasn't even in there.

27:44.560 --> 27:52.560
He just left the house without saying anything. And as those thoughts are flowing through your brain, the front door swings open.

27:52.560 --> 27:59.560
Hey Ma, you're up. Oh, this is awkward.

27:59.560 --> 28:12.560
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. I thought that was a burglar coming in, but no, it's just my son staying out all hours again.

28:12.560 --> 28:15.560
And where have you been tonight, young man?

28:15.560 --> 28:22.560
Get some drinks with the boys. You know, it's... I had a bad night, Mama.

28:22.560 --> 28:28.560
Yes, I can smell just how bad your night was from here. Yes.

28:30.560 --> 28:35.560
You're not going to bed until you put something in your stomach to soak up some of that beer.

28:35.560 --> 28:43.560
There's still some hot dog casserole in the oven. It's probably, oh, it's probably burnt to a crisp by now.

28:43.560 --> 28:48.560
But, well, give it a try. Cut up the wieners nice and small, just the way you like it.

28:48.560 --> 28:52.560
Just the way I like it. Cut up more hot dogs.

28:53.560 --> 29:00.560
Beck starts walking toward the fridge and you can tell now that he's a little drunker even than you've ever seen him.

29:00.560 --> 29:06.560
He's a stumble-ier than you've ever seen him. And he kind of catches himself, woo, a little woozy.

29:06.560 --> 29:17.560
Sorry. Sorry about that, Ma. I know we don't like to talk about like what I do, but like I saw some shit tonight, Mom. It was bad.

29:17.560 --> 29:21.560
And what exactly did you see?

29:21.560 --> 29:30.560
Oh, it's kind of like a thing that's like under investigation now. I don't know if like I might need a lawyer to talk to you about it.

29:30.560 --> 29:37.560
Honestly, I really don't understand why you can't have a proper job. You're out all hours.

29:37.560 --> 29:46.560
I never know whether I'm going to find you sleeping in your room in the middle of the afternoon or whether you're going to stay out until three o'clock in the morning.

29:46.560 --> 29:51.560
Clearly, what you're doing isn't making you enough money for you to actually move into your own place.

29:51.560 --> 29:56.560
And now you're saying that it's dangerous as well and it's going to get you into trouble.

29:56.560 --> 30:01.560
Why do you do this? Why can't you just get a proper job?

30:01.560 --> 30:13.560
You know, Macey Grindel's son, Deke, he's got he's got a nice thriving business for himself selling secondhand sofa beds and he's moved into a new apartment downtown.

30:13.560 --> 30:20.560
It's all his own. Well, I think he's got a couple of flatmates, but he's not living with his mother anymore. That's the important thing.

30:20.560 --> 30:28.560
Yeah, but Deke's a fucking asshole. Oh, not this again. Jesus Christ.

30:28.560 --> 30:33.560
He's a financially solvent asshole.

30:33.560 --> 30:37.560
Sorry, the internet connection cut out a little bit right there.

30:37.560 --> 30:47.560
He's a financially solvent asshole.

30:47.560 --> 30:50.560
Brilliant.

30:50.560 --> 31:01.560
As Kim started to go into that diatribe, Beck had his back to her and he was kind of mouthing along with these words. He's heard it so many times.

31:01.560 --> 31:08.560
Oh, she's got to mention Deke again. She's got to mention Deke. Oh, there we go.

31:08.560 --> 31:14.560
If you love Deke so much, why didn't you give birth to him?

31:14.560 --> 31:22.560
Don't think that I haven't thought about that every day. Ew, gross, mom. You think about fucking Deke's dad?

31:22.560 --> 31:26.560
A wistful look crosses Kim's eyes.

31:26.560 --> 31:31.560
Oh my God.

31:31.560 --> 31:40.560
For like half a second, I thought we were going to get something really meaningful when Kim was like, why do you even do this job?

31:40.560 --> 31:48.560
And then Beck's like, go fuck my friend's dad.

31:48.560 --> 32:00.560
At this point, Beck has lost the gusto for the hot dog casserole and is just kind of like slopping it onto a plate and throwing it in the microwave and is trying his best to like avoid eye contact with you.

32:00.560 --> 32:07.560
Look, Ma, I know that it's like not like the best paying thing in the world, but it's like what I want to do.

32:07.560 --> 32:14.560
Like, I don't know if you can understand like happiness from that perspective, but that's what I've got for me right now.

32:14.560 --> 32:29.560
Look, you've got to understand that part of being a grown up is that we all have to do things that we don't want to do, because that's just how we get through life.

32:29.560 --> 32:37.560
And yes, all right, you can run around doing your camera stuff and whatever it is you do at three o'clock in the morning.

32:37.560 --> 32:44.560
And I try not to judge you, but sooner or later, you've got to grow up.

32:44.560 --> 32:50.560
You can't just carry on like this and pretend that everything's all right.

32:50.560 --> 32:55.560
You've got to you've got to grow up someday, boy.

32:55.560 --> 33:02.560
Beck is now kind of a little more solemn and a little more introspective visually.

33:02.560 --> 33:07.560
And he pulls the food out of the microwave and he's holding the plate and he's kind of picking at it with a fork.

33:07.560 --> 33:13.560
Yeah, I mean, fine. We disagree on like fundamental things, Ma.

33:13.560 --> 33:23.560
I just maybe someday you'll see that I can I can do this and also like be successful, whatever that means to you.

33:23.560 --> 33:25.560
I'm going to my room.

33:25.560 --> 33:28.560
All right. You'll have to pick up the clean sheets.

33:28.560 --> 33:31.560
I've left them out for you, but you'll have to make the bed yourself.

33:31.560 --> 33:42.560
And I tried to get the stains out, but we're going to have to try a new brand.

33:42.560 --> 33:48.560
Yeah, OK, thanks. Thanks, Mommy. You got any milk?

33:48.560 --> 33:53.560
Sounds a bit flogging.

33:53.560 --> 34:06.560
Scott, we didn't bring you on here to roleplay anything other than what's about to happen.

34:06.560 --> 34:15.560
Scott, thank you so much. I think I think that's perfect.

34:15.560 --> 34:18.560
Scott, as always, an absolute pleasure.

34:18.560 --> 34:25.560
Oh, thank you. Zach, we live in a weird, privileged world that we just had Scott Dorward on to play with my mom.

34:25.560 --> 34:31.560
And I said, thanks, Mommy. Got any milk?

34:31.560 --> 34:33.560
And then we said, have a good day.

34:33.560 --> 34:39.560
That is good to hold me.

34:39.560 --> 34:42.560
All right, Scott, thank you so much. Seriously, thank you so much.

34:42.560 --> 34:49.560
And for those of you who enjoyed Scott just now, you can hear him.

34:49.560 --> 34:55.560
He runs two different full scenarios for us on pretending to be people in our bonus episodes.

34:55.560 --> 34:56.560
Episodes? Episodes?

34:56.560 --> 35:04.560
Here on the main feed, Scott, you ran Bleak Prospect, a Call of Cthulhu scenario that you wrote so fucking creepy.

35:04.560 --> 35:06.560
It's one of my favorite things that we've done on the show.

35:06.560 --> 35:11.560
Starts in a Hoover town and goes to worse places.

35:11.560 --> 35:19.560
And you also recently ran a Pulp Cthulhu scenario, both of which, by the way, that Scott wrote.

35:19.560 --> 35:21.560
This one was A New Age of Wonders.

35:21.560 --> 35:29.560
And that was, for me personally, I think one of my absolute favorite player experiences I've ever had in an RPG.

35:29.560 --> 35:34.560
Oh, man. Oh, I'm glad you liked it. I had an absolute blast running it.

35:34.560 --> 35:35.560
We did, too.

35:35.560 --> 35:38.560
That's so fun.

35:38.560 --> 35:44.560
All right, well, I'm going to stop gushing and we'll see you soon, Scott.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.560
Oh, marvelous. Look forward to it.

35:46.560 --> 35:48.560
Good night, Mommy.

35:48.560 --> 35:51.560
Oh, God. I've got to go and have a bath now.

35:51.560 --> 36:03.560
We're Team Press! We're Team Press! We're Team Press! We're Team Press! We're Team Press! We're Team Press!

36:03.560 --> 36:07.560
If you're just now joining us, welcome back to Pretending to Be People.

36:07.560 --> 36:10.560
We are here with a special guest right now.

36:10.560 --> 36:20.560
It is the GM of the Lost Mountain Saga, one of the best players from Glass Cannon Networks, and droids, and aliens.

36:20.560 --> 36:26.560
It is Eleanor de Lorenzo.

36:26.560 --> 36:31.560
Let's get one that the people can hear.

36:31.560 --> 36:37.560
It's fun to talk like this, but I don't know if anybody can understand Eleanor de Lorenzo.

36:37.560 --> 36:38.560
Hey, Ellie.

36:38.560 --> 36:46.560
Hello. I understood. There were compliments in that. I understood that. I sucked that up right up.

36:46.560 --> 36:48.560
I picked those out right away.

36:48.560 --> 36:50.560
Thank you so much for coming back on.

36:50.560 --> 36:52.560
Ellie, thank you so much for coming and joining us again.

36:52.560 --> 36:56.560
Oh, dude. I'm so excited to be back. Thank you for inviting me.

36:56.560 --> 37:01.560
If you're listening to this and you haven't heard Ellie on Pretending to Be People before,

37:01.560 --> 37:07.560
Ellie was a guest and a player when I ran a homebrew scenario that I wrote, Bigfoot Underground Search and Hunt.

37:07.560 --> 37:12.560
for her and some other guest players, and we had an absolutely phenomenal time.

37:12.560 --> 37:17.560
You were such a wonderful player that I was so excited to bring you back on.

37:17.560 --> 37:22.560
But another huge reason that I was so excited to bring you on is when I told Thomas, I was like,

37:22.560 --> 37:27.560
Hey, dude, Ellie from A&A is coming on Pretending to Be People.

37:27.560 --> 37:33.560
Yeah, and then you had her play with a bunch of people who weren't fans of that show.

37:33.560 --> 37:37.560
Which as a fan was like, well, that's a bummer.

37:37.560 --> 37:43.560
Couldn't have anyone except me getting too starstruck on her first appearance on Pretending to Be People.

37:43.560 --> 37:46.560
Fair enough. You wanted to protect her from...

37:46.560 --> 37:49.560
From what's about to happen, yes.

37:49.560 --> 37:53.560
From the slobbering idiots of the PTBP pod.

37:53.560 --> 37:58.560
I love slobbering idiots, though. That's what I'm more comfortable with, you know what I'm saying?

37:58.560 --> 38:03.560
Now I played with very talented, wonderful women and they were all great, but I will say...

38:03.560 --> 38:04.560
That sounds deeply intimidating.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.560
Intimidating, yeah.

38:06.560 --> 38:10.560
They were hot. They stared at me with their hot eyes.

38:10.560 --> 38:13.560
And one of them was apparently married to you, Zach.

38:13.560 --> 38:15.560
That is correct, yeah, apparently.

38:15.560 --> 38:16.560
Apparently.

38:16.560 --> 38:17.560
Apparently?

38:17.560 --> 38:19.560
Yeah, allegedly married.

38:19.560 --> 38:23.560
Allegedly, Taylor and her hot eyes are married to Zach.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.560
I'm an allegedly lucky man.

38:28.560 --> 38:35.560
Okay. I'm not going to correct that because I'm waiting for all the chinks in your marriage's armor to collapse at once.

38:35.560 --> 38:39.560
Coming in hot. Coming in hot. Love it.

38:39.560 --> 38:41.560
I'll have to beat Luke off, but...

38:41.560 --> 38:44.560
Wow, I'd watch that.

38:44.560 --> 38:46.560
So, Thomas, are you married?

38:46.560 --> 38:48.560
Uh, no. No, I'm not married.

38:48.560 --> 38:52.560
You said that very quickly, no. It was like a gut reaction, no.

38:52.560 --> 38:54.560
Well, I remembered that I wasn't.

38:54.560 --> 38:56.560
Oh, right. Well...

38:56.560 --> 38:59.560
You looked back at your whole life and you thought...

38:59.560 --> 39:02.560
Did I leave a wife somewhere?

39:02.560 --> 39:03.560
Along the road?

39:03.560 --> 39:06.560
It's like when people ask you if you're like, do you have any kids?

39:06.560 --> 39:08.560
And you're like, not that I'm aware of.

39:08.560 --> 39:10.560
It's like, do you have a wife? Not that I'm aware of.

39:10.560 --> 39:12.560
Not that I'm aware of.

39:12.560 --> 39:19.560
I'm known for not knowing much about America and I just realized that I know you guys are from a state.

39:19.560 --> 39:23.560
But I don't remember which state right this second.

39:23.560 --> 39:25.560
Is it Missouri?

39:25.560 --> 39:26.560
Yeah.

39:26.560 --> 39:27.560
Wow.

39:27.560 --> 39:31.560
I was going to make a joke about you have a one in 50 shot, so just go for it.

39:31.560 --> 39:32.560
You fucking nailed it.

39:32.560 --> 39:33.560
I did.

39:33.560 --> 39:34.560
Got it in one.

39:34.560 --> 39:38.560
It is indeed Missouri, which we like, but a lot of people don't.

39:38.560 --> 39:40.560
Oh, yeah. We love it.

39:40.560 --> 39:43.560
It's nice here. It's really hot right now, actually. It sucks here.

39:43.560 --> 39:46.560
Oh, but still, I would love to go.

39:46.560 --> 39:52.560
But is it nice because it's like, you know, you can be on a horse ranch and...

39:52.560 --> 39:53.560
I'm sorry.

39:53.560 --> 39:55.560
Yeah, you can be on a horse ranch.

39:55.560 --> 39:56.560
Okay.

39:56.560 --> 40:03.560
Well, I mean, I don't make very much money and this is my house that we're recording in.

40:03.560 --> 40:11.560
Oh, screw you and making fun of my bullshit New York studio cabin.

40:11.560 --> 40:12.560
But that's true.

40:12.560 --> 40:14.560
That's a really cool thing about Missouri.

40:14.560 --> 40:17.560
You have an actual kitchen. I love that.

40:17.560 --> 40:20.560
I want a Missouri kitchen.

40:20.560 --> 40:25.560
Let's get into Cal, Colorado.

40:25.560 --> 40:27.560
Cal, you've had a very interesting night.

40:27.560 --> 40:32.560
I want to dive back into some of the things that you've seen here on this random night.

40:32.560 --> 40:33.560
I don't.

40:33.560 --> 40:38.560
Oh, yeah. That makes sense because one of these memories that keeps just blasting into your head

40:38.560 --> 40:46.560
as you're leaving the foundry is just this headless, almost headless neck

40:46.560 --> 40:49.560
held on by a couple of tendons and skin on ones.

40:50.560 --> 40:58.560
Your mind drifts immediately from this severed neck off to your daughter.

40:58.560 --> 41:02.560
A little bit. Mostly my mind is just shouting neck hole, neck hole, neck hole

41:02.560 --> 41:08.560
as I see like this horrifying like red flash and this image of this nearly headless neck.

41:08.560 --> 41:11.560
Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as you get into your car.

41:11.560 --> 41:16.560
Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as you drive really far back to your home.

41:16.560 --> 41:20.560
Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole, neck hole everywhere.

41:20.560 --> 41:25.560
Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as you sit into your chair.

41:25.560 --> 41:29.560
And he turns on a 24-hour news channel like he always does.

41:29.560 --> 41:31.560
Natch. Drown it out, baby.

41:31.560 --> 41:35.560
Honestly, the cleaning person must have turned it off because he kind of likes to just keep it on all day.

41:35.560 --> 41:41.560
But yeah, he turns that on. He goes over to his pretty dusty home bar.

41:42.560 --> 41:48.560
He grabs a glass and takes a bottle of cheap white wine out of the refrigerator

41:48.560 --> 41:52.560
and pours it to the brim and then downs that and pours another.

41:52.560 --> 41:57.560
And at that moment, you feel a vibration coming from your pocket

41:57.560 --> 42:02.560
and it's not the vibration of a text or a call. Do you not have a phone that vibrates?

42:02.560 --> 42:08.560
No, he does, but we don't do vibrates here. We have a ring on this podcast.

42:08.560 --> 42:09.560
That's right.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.560
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

42:11.560 --> 42:14.560
Yeah, he hears the ringtone set to his daughter, Carol.

42:16.560 --> 42:22.560
Eleanor de Lorenzo, what does Carol's face look like on the screen of Cal's phone here?

42:22.560 --> 42:25.560
It's a young woman, young 20s.

42:25.560 --> 42:30.560
She currently looks a little flushed, as if she might have been, I don't know, working out or something.

42:30.560 --> 42:34.560
But since Saturday night, you might assume that she might be a little tipsy.

42:34.560 --> 42:39.560
And she's sitting down on a couch that you recognize to be her student room.

42:39.560 --> 42:40.560
Hey!

42:43.560 --> 42:51.560
Carol, it's lovely to hear from you. I'm sorry, I've had kind of an extraordinary evening.

42:52.560 --> 42:53.560
Honey, how are you?

42:53.560 --> 42:58.560
Dad, can you tilt your phone up a little bit? I can't see you.

42:58.560 --> 43:00.560
Like you're filming your forehead again.

43:00.560 --> 43:02.560
He tilts it down and you can just see his chin.

43:03.560 --> 43:04.560
Is this better?

43:04.560 --> 43:05.560
No, please.

43:06.560 --> 43:11.560
You remember, like you can put it a little bit further away from your face. That works better.

43:11.560 --> 43:14.560
You just see one giant eye as he's looking into the camera lens.

43:14.560 --> 43:18.560
Alright, and she puts down the phone and it's just voiceover.

43:23.560 --> 43:28.560
Honey, I'd love to see your darling face, especially with you so far away from home.

43:28.560 --> 43:30.560
Please explain FaceTime to me.

43:33.560 --> 43:36.560
Oh, Dad, have you been drinking?

43:36.560 --> 43:44.560
Just a little wine. It's a Saturday night. I'm a single man. Can I not enjoy a sifter of wine?

43:44.560 --> 43:48.560
No, of course. Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you a little bit about.

43:48.560 --> 43:53.560
I wondered if you... Have you been doing anything fun lately? Like, except working?

43:53.560 --> 43:57.560
Work is fun, sweetie. Your mother and I always tried to tell you that.

43:57.560 --> 44:06.560
No, I know. I know. I just... I don't know. I worry about you. That's why... I just wish you, you know, would get out there a little bit.

44:06.560 --> 44:12.560
Cal thinks about where he just got out to and pauses and he kind of gulps and he's like,

44:12.560 --> 44:18.560
I get out, sweetie. Just today I saw some corn wrestling while I was out on assignment.

44:18.560 --> 44:24.560
They also had crabs. Not the men. The farm. They raised corn and crabs.

44:24.560 --> 44:25.560
Alright.

44:25.560 --> 44:27.560
So I get out.

44:27.560 --> 44:37.560
Yeah, no, I get it. I know. I just... I don't know if you... I'm sure you already heard, but Mom, I think... Mom's seeing someone.

44:37.560 --> 44:43.560
Yes, I heard. He's quite a bit younger, too. I heard he was 40.

44:43.560 --> 44:49.560
Yeah, but, I mean, after you turn 25, it's like age doesn't matter anymore.

44:49.560 --> 44:51.560
Oh.

44:51.560 --> 45:00.560
She says that with 100% sincerity because she thinks that if you're over 25, you're ancient.

45:00.560 --> 45:05.560
And you can tell that suddenly Carol seems a little bit nervous.

45:05.560 --> 45:06.560
Yeah, I don't know.

45:06.560 --> 45:08.560
Is there something else on your mind, sweetie?

45:08.560 --> 45:12.560
Well, promise you won't get angry.

45:12.560 --> 45:13.560
I promise.

45:13.560 --> 45:23.560
Well, you know that I always wanted to make you happy, and that's why I went to journalism school.

45:23.560 --> 45:29.560
Of course. Just like your mother and I, you went on to journalism school to continue the family business.

45:29.560 --> 45:33.560
Which is your ultimate dream and desire, of course, right?

45:33.560 --> 45:40.560
Right. But, well, I've decided, and she suddenly gets defensive as if she's ready to fight.

45:40.560 --> 45:43.560
I've decided that I'm not going to do that anymore.

45:43.560 --> 45:49.560
I've decided that I am going to pursue something else, something that I am passionate about.

45:49.560 --> 45:53.560
And it's not journalism, it's not writing, it's not any of that.

45:53.560 --> 45:59.560
I have decided I'm going to become a nature photographer.

45:59.560 --> 46:04.560
Well, sweetie, that's... that's wonderful.

46:04.560 --> 46:05.560
Really?

46:05.560 --> 46:09.560
You know, photography is still technically journalism.

46:09.560 --> 46:12.560
No, no, okay, what...

46:12.560 --> 46:17.560
Sweetheart, I just want you to know that no matter what you choose,

46:17.560 --> 46:25.560
even if you're not a world-class news anchor like me or a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist like your mother,

46:25.560 --> 46:36.560
we're happy that what you have chosen is still inexplicably linked to the nexus of reporting and,

46:36.560 --> 46:39.560
well, you know, showing the truth of our world to the people.

46:39.560 --> 46:40.560
That's what it's all about.

46:40.560 --> 46:45.560
Okay, well, see, see, that was like... I knew that you were going to react like that,

46:45.560 --> 46:49.560
so now I'm going to tell you the real... my real job.

46:49.560 --> 46:51.560
A bait and switch.

46:51.560 --> 46:55.560
I'm going to tell you the real... it's still related to photography.

46:55.560 --> 46:57.560
Yeah?

46:57.560 --> 47:04.560
But it's like for, like, beautiful women posing without clothing.

47:04.560 --> 47:05.560
Pornography?

47:05.560 --> 47:06.560
Pornography?

47:06.560 --> 47:07.560
No, it's not pornography.

47:07.560 --> 47:08.560
Carolina?

47:08.560 --> 47:11.560
It's not pornography.

47:11.560 --> 47:14.560
It's boudoir photography.

47:14.560 --> 47:15.560
Oh, I'm sorry.

47:15.560 --> 47:20.560
Nerd pornography.

47:20.560 --> 47:21.560
See, this is the thing.

47:21.560 --> 47:22.560
You never understand.

47:22.560 --> 47:23.560
You mock everything I do.

47:23.560 --> 47:25.560
That's the problem with you and mom.

47:25.560 --> 47:28.560
You're both academics and I don't want to be involved with this.

47:28.560 --> 47:29.560
Like, I don't want to go to school anymore.

47:29.560 --> 47:31.560
I'm going to buy my camera.

47:31.560 --> 47:36.560
I'm going to take pictures of my friends and they will pay me eventually.

47:36.560 --> 47:39.560
And then I'll start an Instagram account and I'm going to make a lot of money.

47:39.560 --> 47:41.560
And there's nothing you can say or do.

47:41.560 --> 47:42.560
And, yeah.

47:42.560 --> 47:44.560
Roll a grip check, Dad.

47:44.560 --> 47:45.560
No, I think he's...

47:45.560 --> 47:46.560
No, no, no. This is...

47:46.560 --> 47:47.560
Hold on.

47:47.560 --> 47:49.560
This is specifically because of what you've seen tonight

47:49.560 --> 47:51.560
and the amount of grip that you lost.

47:51.560 --> 47:54.560
It is going to affect the relationships that you have.

47:54.560 --> 47:57.560
Yeah, I know, but what I was just about to say was all about that.

47:57.560 --> 47:58.560
Oh, okay.

47:58.560 --> 48:00.560
And why it actually wouldn't.

48:00.560 --> 48:05.560
Well, that's part of the game is you have to roll to do that.

48:05.560 --> 48:07.560
Yeah, he hates the dice.

48:07.560 --> 48:09.560
But he succeeds.

48:09.560 --> 48:10.560
Okay, yeah.

48:10.560 --> 48:11.560
All fair enough.

48:11.560 --> 48:17.560
So you see from the part of your father's chin that you can't see.

48:17.560 --> 48:19.560
It, like, quivers a little bit.

48:19.560 --> 48:23.560
But then he composes itself and he says,

48:23.560 --> 48:28.560
Honey, your mother and I will support you no matter what you choose to do.

48:28.560 --> 48:30.560
We only want you to be happy.

48:30.560 --> 48:36.560
And tonight I saw some horrible things that I can never unsee.

48:36.560 --> 48:41.560
If you can make beautiful art and put it into this world,

48:41.560 --> 48:43.560
that is enough for me.

48:43.560 --> 48:47.560
You're going to want to approach this more carefully with your mother.

48:47.560 --> 48:50.560
We may not tell her until you've graduated.

48:50.560 --> 48:52.560
Well, I'm not going to graduate. That's the thing.

48:52.560 --> 48:53.560
Right, right, right.

48:53.560 --> 48:57.560
Until you burlesque photography.

48:57.560 --> 49:03.560
Well, this is a whole new world for me, pumpkin.

49:03.560 --> 49:06.560
So, Dad, are you all right?

49:06.560 --> 49:08.560
You said you've seen some horrible stuff.

49:08.560 --> 49:10.560
I didn't see a neck hole.

49:10.560 --> 49:13.560
Sorry, one of the wrestlers broke his arm.

49:13.560 --> 49:15.560
It bent the wrong way.

49:15.560 --> 49:18.560
It was gnarly.

49:18.560 --> 49:22.560
I love that Cal picked up the word gnarly from Beck.

49:22.560 --> 49:25.560
Oh, no, Jesus. Is he going to be okay?

49:25.560 --> 49:27.560
Yes, sweetie, I think he'll be fine.

49:27.560 --> 49:29.560
Everything will be fine in the world.

49:29.560 --> 49:32.560
And you will, no matter what you choose to do,

49:32.560 --> 49:35.560
you will be an important contributing part of it.

49:35.560 --> 49:37.560
And your mother and I love you very deeply.

49:37.560 --> 49:39.560
Well, I love you too, Dad.

49:39.560 --> 49:41.560
And she's starting to get worried.

49:41.560 --> 49:44.560
Like, wow, he really needs to start getting out there.

49:47.560 --> 49:49.560
I don't know, Dad, I know it's not my business,

49:49.560 --> 49:52.560
but I think it would be good for you to, like,

49:52.560 --> 49:55.560
there are apps you can download that would, like,

49:55.560 --> 49:58.560
match you with other women.

49:58.560 --> 50:01.560
I just don't want you to be, like, be alone.

50:01.560 --> 50:04.560
I'm not alone, sweetie.

50:04.560 --> 50:07.560
I have you. I have my memories.

50:07.560 --> 50:09.560
He points to all the pictures around the house.

50:09.560 --> 50:10.560
Oh, my God.

50:10.560 --> 50:13.560
See, that's the definition of being alone.

50:13.560 --> 50:17.560
But I will try to get out there more.

50:17.560 --> 50:20.560
What are these women apps you told me about?

50:20.560 --> 50:23.560
Well, one of them is called Bumble.

50:23.560 --> 50:24.560
Bumble?

50:24.560 --> 50:26.560
I mean, like, when you've downloaded them, let me know

50:26.560 --> 50:29.560
and I'll give you some advice because you can't be, like,

50:29.560 --> 50:33.560
don't start commenting on women's profiles like a weirdo.

50:35.560 --> 50:37.560
How do you comment like a normal-o?

50:37.560 --> 50:39.560
Well, you just wait for them to, like,

50:39.560 --> 50:41.560
you put up a nice picture of yourself

50:41.560 --> 50:43.560
and then you write something nice about you,

50:43.560 --> 50:45.560
like you're an established journalist,

50:45.560 --> 50:48.560
and then you wait for women to contact you.

50:48.560 --> 50:52.560
Is there an app that finds me a woman exactly like your mother?

50:52.560 --> 50:54.560
Oh, no.

50:54.560 --> 50:55.560
Dad.

50:55.560 --> 50:56.560
What?

50:56.560 --> 50:57.560
No.

51:00.560 --> 51:03.560
Maybe you should go for the complete opposite.

51:03.560 --> 51:04.560
Like a guy?

51:07.560 --> 51:09.560
Well, maybe.

51:09.560 --> 51:10.560
I don't know, man.

51:11.560 --> 51:16.560
Carol, I promise you, I will look into online dating.

51:16.560 --> 51:18.560
Carol, exciting news.

51:18.560 --> 51:21.560
Do you post your boudoir pictures on TikTok?

51:21.560 --> 51:22.560
Well, okay.

51:22.560 --> 51:24.560
So, Dad, you can't follow my friends.

51:24.560 --> 51:26.560
Like, they are not part of the dating pool.

51:26.560 --> 51:27.560
Is that why you're asking?

51:27.560 --> 51:28.560
No, no.

51:28.560 --> 51:29.560
Have you heard of this?

51:29.560 --> 51:31.560
Have you heard of TikTok?

51:32.560 --> 51:34.560
Of course I've heard about TikTok.

51:34.560 --> 51:35.560
Oh, I'm sorry.

51:35.560 --> 51:38.560
Well, I learned about it today and I did a dance.

51:38.560 --> 51:39.560
No, no.

51:39.560 --> 51:42.560
Carol, no, you should see the dance I did.

51:42.560 --> 51:45.560
It's posted on the Cannes TikTok for the station.

51:45.560 --> 51:46.560
People liked it.

51:48.560 --> 51:49.560
You'll see, I'm out there.

51:49.560 --> 51:52.560
Hey, Carol, when you pull it up on your phone,

51:52.560 --> 51:55.560
you see it's called the Calzone.

51:55.560 --> 51:56.560
Oh, God.

51:56.560 --> 51:57.560
Oh, God.

51:57.560 --> 52:00.560
And he's doing a dance with a random guy on the street

52:00.560 --> 52:02.560
who's doing a very cool dance

52:02.560 --> 52:05.560
where it looks like he's sitting while he's upright

52:05.560 --> 52:08.560
and dancing around in a sitting position.

52:08.560 --> 52:11.560
And Cal does it perfectly alongside of him.

52:11.560 --> 52:13.560
Wow, Dad, actually, that's pretty impressive.

52:13.560 --> 52:16.560
You should, actually, you should keep doing that.

52:16.560 --> 52:19.560
In a weird, twisted reality that we currently live in,

52:19.560 --> 52:23.560
you would actually find more dates based on this video.

52:23.560 --> 52:25.560
With women like your mother?

52:28.560 --> 52:30.560
Women like my mom, sure.

52:30.560 --> 52:33.560
But you should not narrow your, like,

52:33.560 --> 52:36.560
there are plenty of women out there that aren't like mom.

52:36.560 --> 52:38.560
Oh, well, that's the problem.

52:39.560 --> 52:41.560
All right, Dad.

52:41.560 --> 52:46.560
I have to go, but thank you for being supportive of my choices.

52:46.560 --> 52:48.560
Try to get some sleep and then maybe we'll,

52:48.560 --> 52:50.560
yeah, I'll check in with you tomorrow.

52:50.560 --> 52:53.560
But I still, until I have some money,

52:53.560 --> 52:57.560
maybe don't cancel my credit card yet.

52:59.560 --> 53:01.560
I wouldn't dream of it, sweetie.

53:01.560 --> 53:03.560
But again, don't tell your mother

53:03.560 --> 53:05.560
she would cancel them in a heartbeat.

53:06.560 --> 53:07.560
Thanks, Dad.

53:07.560 --> 53:10.560
Yeah, take care of yourself and I'll talk to you tomorrow.

53:10.560 --> 53:12.560
I love you very much.

53:12.560 --> 53:13.560
I love you too, Dad.

53:13.560 --> 53:15.560
And I, yeah, thank you.

53:17.560 --> 53:18.560
Thank you.

53:18.560 --> 53:21.560
This has been Cal Colorado.

53:21.560 --> 53:22.560
Have a pleasant evening.

53:23.560 --> 53:25.560
You really don't have, okay, fine.

53:28.560 --> 53:30.560
Ellie, thank you so much for coming on the show.

53:30.560 --> 53:31.560
Yeah, thank you, Ellie.

53:31.560 --> 53:32.560
Oh, my God. That was great.

53:32.560 --> 53:33.560
That was fun.

53:33.560 --> 53:35.560
I'm very much looking forward to seeing

53:35.560 --> 53:39.560
how this relationship thrives or...

53:39.560 --> 53:41.560
Yeah, it was very, like, I love how, like,

53:41.560 --> 53:43.560
I expected Zach to come in and be like,

53:43.560 --> 53:46.560
and then all of a sudden her head falls off

53:46.560 --> 53:48.560
and I'm like, she dies.

53:48.560 --> 53:49.560
And I'm like, okay, cool.

53:49.560 --> 53:50.560
We got a long ways to go.

53:50.560 --> 53:52.560
We got time to fuck this shit up.

53:52.560 --> 53:54.560
Yeah, there can definitely be a phone call

53:54.560 --> 53:55.560
where your head falls off.

53:55.560 --> 53:57.560
Hey, if that's what you want.

53:57.560 --> 53:59.560
Is season two a homebrew as well?

53:59.560 --> 54:00.560
Yeah.

54:00.560 --> 54:01.560
Yeah, very nice.

54:01.560 --> 54:02.560
It's all I can do.

54:02.560 --> 54:03.560
I don't like reading.

54:04.560 --> 54:05.560
You actually can't.

54:06.560 --> 54:07.560
I'm too stupid.

54:08.560 --> 54:09.560
It's a shame.

54:32.560 --> 54:34.560
Life is great.

54:35.560 --> 54:37.560
And it's all my fault.
