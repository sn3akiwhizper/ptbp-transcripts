1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
It's your moon howling and scowling.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,400
Pepperoni with the side of extra cheese wulf the dog.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,660
The moistest DJ this side of the solar highway.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:22,480
And I am a-woo-ing at you live from 694.2 PTBP, the greatest radio station that ever

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,480
did.

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,280
Now lets move on to the greatest things y'all ever did.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,960
Write me fan mail.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,140
This week's howlin with wulf is from at black goat underscore m10 who instagrammed about

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,160
the show and tagged at pretending pod.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,800
What a super cool way to let your friends know you're a freak.

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,880
He writes greetings Mr. Wolf.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,480
Pretty new listener and first time howler here.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,480
Great show.

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:56,160
I've not really been into RPGs before but I really enjoy the gangs escapades and contention

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,160
and the city.

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,040
Keep up the good work.

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,800
Big shout out to Victor for sending me your way.

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,280
Appreciative howls from Mattias in Sweden.

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,480
Mattias are you telling me that THE Victor sent you?

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,200
What did he tell you?

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,360
Who do you work for?

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,700
Mattias you're on thin ice buddy and you better watch your back.

23
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,280
And you tell Victor tell him that wulf says hello.

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,800
If you want to write up something for your wulf to howl tag at pretending pod on twitter.

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:38,540
Tag at pretending pod on instagram like Mattias or tag at pretending to be people on facebook.

26
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:44,960
Wolf and his producer haven't spent a single dime on advertising so y'all all here because

27
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,420
of words in mouths or words in posts or words in comments sections.

28
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,040
The point is words are powerful.

29
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,880
Please use yours to share this show with your friends, your co-workers, your grandparents

30
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,640
and step cousins.

31
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,920
And as a reward for your sharing I'll do two things.

32
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,540
One, I might choose you to submit a howling with wulf and two I might and definitely always

33
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,380
do put the links in the show notes.

34
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:22,520
And while you're posting on them socials about 694.2 PTBP keep them ear holes open and receiving

35
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,480
my dulcet tones.

36
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,360
It's time for the news.

37
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,120
Last time the field team at City Action News showed the good people of TikTok a glimpse

38
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,660
into the calzone on their way to a potential story from a woman named Kaylee Silver.

39
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,680
What they found was the scene of a gruesome homicide.

40
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,760
After watching footage from the Furbo it's clear that Kaylee Silver walked over to her

41
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,600
fridge, cracked a beer and her friend Kaylee Gold's head unnaturally snapped toward the

42
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,820
kitchen before this differently dispositioned Kaylee Gold lunged at the apartments resident

43
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,200
Kaylee Silver.

44
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:08,320
The attack took place out of view behind the kitchen counter but it seems Kaylee Silver

45
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,760
stabbed her friend repeatedly in the neck with her broken beer bottle until Kaylee Gold's

46
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,320
head was all but decapitated.

47
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,160
Thankfully for this story the Cannes crew called the city cops, made statements and

48
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,320
headed off to cleanse their palates with a drink at the foundry.

49
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,280
Taking us there now is a bop that don't stop, good shit that don't quit, an anthem for the

50
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,520
handsome.

51
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,560
It's Altagirl with My Life is Great and It's All My Phone.

52
00:03:46,320 --> 00:04:15,360
And it's all mine, cause my life is great and it's all my phone.

53
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,000
So why would we do a season one name?

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,940
Everyone from season one is dead to this podcast, Luke.

55
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,960
We are moving on, this is season two.

56
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,880
Dude, Thomas, ask me anything about season one.

57
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,880
What's season one?

58
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,400
I don't remember.

59
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,080
Welcome back to season two of Pretending to be People.

60
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,600
If you got into this podcast because of season one, thank you, but honestly, that shit is

61
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,560
over and done.

62
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:50,280
And this is a new era of excellence and groundbreaking podcast roleplay, so fucking get your two

63
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,480
tight britches on, which is a reference to nothing.

64
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,920
If you listen to season one...

65
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,920
Stop listening right now.

66
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
Stop.

67
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,920
Yeah, you need to stop.

68
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
Cut that out.

69
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,760
Nope, nope, nope, nope, keep going.

70
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,660
The britches this, oh, I feel like I'm, am I clipping for you guys?

71
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,660
A little bit.

72
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,660
I feel very loud.

73
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,660
I'll turn you down.

74
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,700
Turn me down a little bit.

75
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,900
I'll just talk louder.

76
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,780
Oh, the cats, the cats going in the pod box.

77
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,020
Cat in the pod box.

78
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,020
I will say main difference...

79
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,480
She might knock the pod box off the couch.

80
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,620
After listening to the edited version of the first episode of this season.

81
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,020
Yeah, like edited, once it was edited, we were funny and good.

82
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,020
Exactly.

83
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,020
That was the big difference I noticed.

84
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,820
But after listening to that, huge differences.

85
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,560
The britches are going to be small this year.

86
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
This years.

87
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
This years.

88
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,560
Oh right, they were big in that thing that doesn't exist.

89
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,560
They were big last time and now they're small.

90
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,560
Hey Zach, are they coming out of the f***ing world right now?

91
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
No.

92
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
Oh, okay.

93
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,560
Nevermind.

94
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,560
Which is a reference to nothing.

95
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
Zach is currently...

96
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
That cat is going to leave.

97
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,560
Zach is, yeah, aggressively kissing our cat.

98
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,560
Aggressively kissing the top of Niko Case's head.

99
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,560
And the first two times she was like, yeah, sure.

100
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,560
And then the fifth time she was like, I'm not going to sit on this f***ing couch with

101
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,560
you anymore.

102
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,560
You lost cat privilege.

103
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,560
So obviously I know the answer to this, but Joe, where exactly did we leave off last time?

104
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,560
Oh dude, you should have seen the crazy s*** that I saw.

105
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,560
A girl killed another girl in an apartment and it was messed up.

106
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,560
And we were all kind of exasperated by it.

107
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,560
And so Cal Colorado asked us to go to the foundry to maybe wind down.

108
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,560
Which is not a reference to the old Joplin, Missouri music venue.

109
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,560
It's a reference to what, Zach?

110
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,560
Oh, it's a reference to what, Thomas?

111
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,560
I don't remember exactly, but isn't it a newsman's bar?

112
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,560
I believe it's a bar specifically for newsman's.

113
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,560
That's right.

114
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,560
I remember the whole thing.

115
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,560
I knew the whole time I knew that.

116
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
So, vroom vroom?

117
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
Vroom vroom.

118
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
Vroom vroom.

119
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,560
Julius Summers pulls into the parking lot of the foundry.

120
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,560
Yeah, where's the foundry located, Thomas?

121
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,560
What kind of bar is this?

122
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:12,560
It's got dive bar aesthetics, but much like Cal Colorado's house, there are pictures all over the walls of local news people.

123
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,560
And it's kind of maybe equidistant downtown from the three different local news stations.

124
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,560
And so they all come and relax and unwind there and talk shop afterwards.

125
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,560
Are there any TVs on the walls at all?

126
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Are they showing the news at this place or is it specifically to unwind away from that?

127
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,560
I think they are. I think they never play sports, just the news.

128
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,560
How many news channels are in the city?

129
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,560
He just said there are three.

130
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,560
Okay, there's three TVs then.

131
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:50,560
I think the foundry is in an older building downtown, but just absolutely always in the shadow of these skyscrapers.

132
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,560
We're in the downtown railroad intersect.

133
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,560
I love it. It's right where the train rolls by and there's a...

134
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,560
They do train shots.

135
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,560
Yeah, of course they do train shots.

136
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:14,560
So pretty much every time this foundry is rumbling with the train that is basically right outside its back door.

137
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,560
There's just a shitload of attractive people in good suits getting fucking hammered.

138
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,560
And the trains come by a lot.

139
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:29,560
That's one of the reasons that they chose this place because it's very hard to overhear the conversation like anybody else is having.

140
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,560
You have to lean in close. It's a great place to protect your sources.

141
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:41,560
In your mind, is this place filled with producers and talent or is my ilk of the camera man and crew there?

142
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,560
Everyone comes to the foundry. We're all friends at the foundry.

143
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,560
Cullerton, KY3, any of the other ones?

144
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:59,560
I don't think we're referencing specific networks, but it would definitely be the local ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, local anchor people all hanging out there.

145
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:05,560
Except it's CAN, NNN, Nightly News Now.

146
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,560
ETC is there.

147
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,560
ETC, which is...

148
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,560
Ethical...

149
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,560
This is going to be like PBS and nobody watches it.

150
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
Ethical...

151
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
Television.

152
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,560
Television channel.

153
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,560
Joe, did you do one?

154
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,560
Yeah, now that we said them all.

155
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,560
RBQ. You guys have fun.

156
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,560
It's sponsored by Arby's and it's barbecue.

157
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,560
Barbecue. Yeah, Royal Broadcasting.

158
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,560
Quarterly.

159
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
They only air.

160
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,560
Anyway...

161
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,560
I speedily pull into...

162
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,560
Who packed the ostrich?

163
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,560
I screech into the parking lot of the foundry.

164
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,560
Does Beck say that?

165
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,560
Unless Julius goes...

166
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,560
Julius pulls in, as any normal person would, into a parking spot.

167
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,560
But as he's doing it, he goes...

168
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,560
And then he kind of looks around at the other two and sees Cal is not laughing.

169
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,560
No, Cal is holding onto the oh shit handle.

170
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,560
And is clutching at his chest.

171
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:22,560
Keep in mind throughout these interactions of the sights you just saw at the apartment.

172
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,560
The high rise that you were just at.

173
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,560
Yeah, I bet you we land in silence.

174
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
I bet you we pull in a little somber.

175
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,560
I was going to mention, I don't think...

176
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,560
He would not bring his camera in here.

177
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,560
I think that this is a sacred place that he knows not to film.

178
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,560
Nice.

179
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,560
And that's a very out of character for him.

180
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,560
So you guys walk across...

181
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,560
This is like where the witches and the witch hunters meet.

182
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,560
There are as many people outside smoking as there are inside.

183
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,560
Also smoking?

184
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,560
Yes.

185
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,560
This is a smoking bar, but it's a nice day.

186
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,560
It's a cool evening from an oppressively hot, hot day.

187
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,560
The humidity kind of dies off into the night.

188
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,560
And you've got kind of a cool summer evening as you guys walk across this gravel parking lot.

189
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,560
And head around back to the entrance of the foundry on the train track side.

190
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,560
A train is currently finishing up.

191
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,560
It's bustling through this back area.

192
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,560
And you see a server is haphazardly making their way through the smokers outside with train shots.

193
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,560
He's yelling, train shots!

194
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,560
Who had the train shots?

195
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,560
We got a whole mess of them here.

196
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,560
Cal just like silently takes one off the tray and downs it and puts it back on the tray.

197
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,560
Julius grabs one, takes it, and then puts two dollars down on the tray.

198
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
Nice.

199
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,560
Which train shots are specifically a special here at the foundry.

200
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,560
It is a single dollar for a shot of whiskey.

201
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,560
Whisky.

202
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,560
Whisky.

203
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,560
When the train toots its horn as it drives by.

204
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,560
Scoot! Scoot!

205
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Oh god.

206
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,560
If it's fucking dollar whiskey, we're talking Old Crow or worse.

207
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,560
Oh, it's Old Grandad.

208
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,560
Brown Derby Select.

209
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,560
It's Old Grandad.

210
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
It's Old Grandad.

211
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,560
Oh yeah.

212
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,560
Orange bottle label.

213
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:25,560
And you set this down and the server looks at Cal Colorado with a certain appreciation as he carries on with his job.

214
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,560
I think he knows to just add it to Cal's tab.

215
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
Nice.

216
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:38,560
Julius did put the two dollars down on his tray even though he knew that those were not poured out for Cal and Julius.

217
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,560
Immediately you hear him as he walks over to a group who's calling him over with the train shots.

218
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,560
He's reassuring them like, yeah, yeah, no, I'll be right back, I'll be right back.

219
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:57,560
And their understanding after seeing the looks on the pained faces of Cal Colorado, Julius Summers, and Beck Wilder.

220
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,560
Probably like we recognize.

221
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,560
Are they just like local news crew?

222
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,560
Yeah, it's just another local news crew.

223
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:11,560
They hold up their shots to you as they all wait on the other two shots to come which come quickly and you're all able to.

224
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,560
Beck takes his head off and does an exaggerated bow and puts it back on.

225
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,560
Guys, this is my first time in here.

226
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,560
I'm very excited.

227
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,560
I've heard a lot about it.

228
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,560
This is the first thing that maybe like brightened Cal's face in a while.

229
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,560
Like he gives a very knowing look to Beck.

230
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,560
Well, we have a first timer here.

231
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,560
I think you know what that means, Beck.

232
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,560
We exchange a look and you see a big smile on Beck looking at you.

233
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,560
Are you thinking like we're going to do the full set up like now?

234
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:49,560
Maggie doesn't let any first timers in without putting them through the printing press.

235
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,560
Oh, Julius, my man.

236
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,560
You're going to have fun tonight, dude.

237
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,560
It's going to be good for you.

238
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,560
You're going to want to shake off what we saw earlier.

239
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,560
You're going to forget all about that weird horrible homebrew murder.

240
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,560
I mean, I don't know that I'll forget about that anytime soon, but...

241
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:14,560
No, the images will haunt you for the rest of your life.

242
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,560
But we can obliterate them temporarily.

243
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,560
The printing press?

244
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,560
You'll see.

245
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,560
Julius starts walking faster and wants to be the first one in there

246
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,560
because he's stoked to see what the hell the printing press is.

247
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,560
Do you think that you and I have a booth that we haunt?

248
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,560
Probably, yeah.

249
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
I think that'd be cool.

250
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:41,560
Julius has done his research asking his uncle all about these guys,

251
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,560
so he knows which booth it is.

252
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,560
What?

253
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,560
So Julius goes and sits down in the booth that you guys usually go sit down in.

254
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,560
Do you go sneak in right before Beck gets there?

255
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
No, I'm just leading the way.

256
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,560
I'm just going and sitting down and turning around like,

257
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,560
look what I know.

258
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,560
Hey, that's the one we always sit at.

259
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,560
That's weird, dude. Cool.

260
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,560
Hanging Wes Anderson-style directly center frame of the booth

261
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:17,560
is an old picture of Cal from the night after his first television broadcast

262
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,560
as a head news anchor.

263
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,560
And it's beautifully framed in this old oak wooden frame

264
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,560
and is sitting gloriously.

265
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
He looks like a kid.

266
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,560
The suit's wearing him.

267
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,560
Yeah, Cal sits purposely with us back to that.

268
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,560
In what way?

269
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,560
When people look at it, do they see your face next to your face?

270
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,560
No, what they're going to see is a much younger, more handsome man

271
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,560
with a huge smile on his face next to that aged 30 years

272
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,560
and looking absolutely miserable tonight.

273
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,560
It does have that effect that those are contrasted,

274
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,560
but he's not trying to do it as a power move or anything.

275
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,560
He just doesn't want to catch sight of it.

276
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
Sure, sure, sure.

277
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,560
As Julius slides into the booth, he's not saying anything

278
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,560
but wiggling with excitement.

279
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,560
He's wanted to do this for so long.

280
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,560
Just be a producer and be part of the news and be able to get into this place.

281
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,560
He is so fucking stoked.

282
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,560
Julius, if you wiggle like that during the printing press,

283
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,560
you could lose a finger.

284
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,560
Printing press.

285
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,560
I want to find out what it is.

286
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,560
Your research didn't tell you what it is.

287
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,560
My uncle would not tell me.

288
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,560
That makes sense.

289
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,560
It's kind of a closely guarded secret around here.

290
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,560
I don't think that anybody goes out there

291
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,560
just telling other people about it, you know?

292
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,560
They never do, if they want to live.

293
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,560
Only kidding.

294
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,560
It's a process that happens in three steps.

295
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,560
The first step, you are laid across the bar

296
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,560
and your belly is exposed.

297
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,560
Julius pulls his shirt up as he lays on the table

298
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,560
and then realizes what was said,

299
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,560
and then he goes and sits back down again.

300
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,560
Tell them the second part.

301
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,560
Well, this is kind of like your last moment of choice here,

302
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,560
but you get to decide what liquor you want.

303
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,560
Once you're laying on the bar with your shirt up?

304
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
Uh-huh.

305
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,560
So what would be your choice if you said your favorite liquor?

306
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,560
Tequila.

307
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,560
Ooh, that's a bad choice.

308
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,560
Right on.

309
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,560
The third step is more tequila than you've ever had in your life

310
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:31,560
with hungry news crews eagerly licking it off your midriff.

311
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,560
Oh, God.

312
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:39,560
As Maggie, the hardened barkeep, pours a bottle into your mouth.

313
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,560
Great name, by the way.

314
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,560
So the tequila gets poured into my mouth and...

315
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,560
And your belly button.

316
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,560
On my belly button.

317
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,560
And they let the older interns just absolutely go at you.

318
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,560
The older interns!

319
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,560
So at this point you're probably asking what's in it for you.

320
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,560
The deep respect that comes.

321
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:15,560
I spent a lot of my time in college practicing for this day.

322
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,560
Oh, you've had a lot of people lick you.

323
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,560
I wish.

324
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,560
Oh.

325
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,560
Has anyone licked you?

326
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,560
Julius gets up from the booth and walks over to the bar with his...

327
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,560
While he's like untucking his shirt from his pants.

328
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,560
His all-tan suit.

329
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,560
I thought you were going to describe your body and I was like,

330
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,560
he strikes me as a very pale man.

331
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,560
He's pretty pale, yeah.

332
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,560
You see a trunk of a woman in a denim vest with long...

333
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,560
A vest of a woman in a denim trunk.

334
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,560
And in a long braid down the back of her hair.

335
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,560
She clinks a bell above her head.

336
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,560
And she's like...

337
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,560
Hot off the press.

338
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,560
Hot off the presses.

339
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,560
Oh, that's right.

340
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,560
We got a newbie over at City Action News.

341
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,560
Come on down.

342
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:23,560
Everyone, give it up for Julius Summers.

343
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,560
He's in for the printing press.

344
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,560
Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang.

345
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,560
And the entire crowd...

346
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,560
In circles. All the smokers come inside when they hear the bell.

347
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,560
And immediately jackets come off.

348
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,560
Ties are loosened. Top buttons are undone.

349
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,560
And these very dorky...

350
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,560
You see the interns start circling.

351
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,560
And they all look like Jonah from Veep.

352
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,560
And Julius...

353
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,560
Julius is laying on the bar with his shirt kind of pulled up.

354
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,560
Exposing his stomach.

355
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:00,560
And then one of the Jonah interns just rips all of his upper clothing off.

356
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:08,560
printing press!

357
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,560
And the chants fade away.

358
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,560
Much like Julius's memories.

359
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,560
From the entire night.

360
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:23,560
Beck and Cow, however, don't get printing pressed by a bunch of rabid interns.

361
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,560
And therefore are able to keep their wits in their brain helmets for the evening.

362
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,560
Let's go check that out.

363
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,560
Hey, thanks so much for listening to Pretending to Be People.

364
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,560
Probably means you're fucking cool.

365
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:45,560
We've got a very special guest on today's episode of Pretending to Be People.

366
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,560
I had an idea in my head when we were discussing the recording of Season 2.

367
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:56,560
Joe and I had talked about who his character would interact with the most.

368
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,560
And your answer to that was...

369
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,560
Mother.

370
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,560
The answer was mother.

371
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:09,560
I think you specifically told me I can't have dead parents this time.

372
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,560
Well, not yet.

373
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,560
Not yet, exactly.

374
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:24,560
And when you said mom, immediately I thought, well, let's get our podcast dad to come on and play Beck Wilder's mom.

375
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,560
It's Scott Norwood is back, baby!

376
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,560
Thank you very much for having me back on.

377
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,560
This isn't the first time I've been called a mother, but at least the circumstances are different.

378
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,560
Well, we really appreciate you coming on.

379
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:45,560
For those of you who are just hearing Scott on Pretending to Be People for the first time for some fucking reason.

380
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:51,560
Scott is my parasocial RPG mentor.

381
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,560
He didn't know that he was my mentor.

382
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:02,560
But listening to his podcast that he does with Matt Sanderson and Paul Fricker, good friends of Jackson Elias,

383
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:08,560
truly developed me into the GM that I am today.

384
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:14,560
And I am super appreciative of all the lessons I've learned listening to their podcast over the years.

385
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,560
Oh, blimey. I'm still amazed that anyone even listens to it, let alone learns.

386
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,560
Scott, before I was ever aware of who you were, I knew that Zach listened to your podcast,

387
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:30,560
and you answered some questions for him one time, and he was so excited and told us all about it.

388
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:35,560
And that was way before there was ever a glimmer of hope of meeting you, let alone playing with you.

389
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:40,560
Oh, yeah. We weren't even talking about recording a podcast, but I was running Hell in Texas,

390
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:47,560
which is a scenario that you wrote for the book The Things We Leave Behind by Stigine Fox Publishing.

391
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:53,560
And that's a great book, and your scenario in it is so terrifying and awesome.

392
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,560
So I posted some questions on the subreddit, and you yourself came in and answered them,

393
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,560
and I lost my fucking shit, Scott.

394
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:14,560
I waste half my life on Reddit. It is my main time sink, and I am not proud of that.

395
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:22,560
Well, that time sink made this nerd super happy and validated many, many years ago, so thank you for that.

396
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:28,560
Some might say this podcast wouldn't exist without you, Scott. You gave him the hope, the drive.

397
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,560
Oh, it's all my fault now, is it?

398
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,560
We have to pin it on somebody.

399
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:49,560
I would like to take us to the home of Beck and Kim Wilder as Ramona scoots her cat.

400
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,560
Zach has a cat food bowl that is one of those ones that's like a maze.

401
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,560
Yeah, it keeps Ramona nice and...

402
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,560
But it kind of becomes a game.

403
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,560
Smart, yeah.

404
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:08,560
Yeah, she grabs each piece individually and then eats it out of her own paw, which is rad.

405
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,560
But noisy, I imagine.

406
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,560
Quite noisy. I'm going to move it into the back room.

407
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:23,560
I barely get through a recording session without one of my cats running into the room and screaming like a seagull,

408
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,560
or jumping all over things and knocking shit over.

409
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,560
Yep.

410
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,560
My cats are named Chaos and Anarchy and it's with good reason.

411
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,560
That's great.

412
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:40,560
Beck Wilder has had a brutal day.

413
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,560
Started off fine.

414
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,560
Woke up around 2 p.m. in your tighty-whities, in your messy bedroom.

415
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,560
Headed off, shot a segment out on a farm.

416
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,560
He had a rough evening? Was it evening?

417
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:02,560
Yeah, it was a rough evening. You were called out for a potential story that was...

418
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,560
We weren't even 100% sure what we were going out there for.

419
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,560
And what did you find?

420
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,560
Oh man, it wasn't good.

421
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:15,560
It was a terrible, terrible crime scene, including a partially severed head.

422
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,560
Yeah.

423
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,560
That wasn't what Beck was thinking was going to happen that day.

424
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:25,560
Yeah, I mean, a severed head is bad enough. A partially severed head sounds worse.

425
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,560
Yeah, it's a lot worse.

426
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,560
Just holding on.

427
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,560
Just a little hinge.

428
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,560
Beck isn't in the greatest headspace.

429
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,560
He's now just gotten back from the foundry where he had a nice night trying to drink his troubles away.

430
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,560
Are you feeling a little loose? You feeling a little warm in the face?

431
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,560
Beck always feels loose.

432
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:56,560
He's maybe a little bit looser than normal, but he kind of lives in an equilibrium of inebriation.

433
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,560
A loose state. I like that.

434
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:10,560
So as you arrive home, it's late at night. It's 1130 PM, maybe even midnight, which is about as late in the night as you can get.

435
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,560
Before it starts becoming morning.

436
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,560
That's right.

437
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:31,560
Kim Wilder has the home to herself. Her son is a mid 30s field cameraman for City Action News, and he is still living in your house, Kim.

438
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,560
For now.

439
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,560
What is Kim Wilder up to on a random Saturday evening?

440
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:47,560
I think she's sitting there on the sofa, knitting and watching television.

441
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:53,560
The sound is way down on the TV and there's just the clack, clack, clack of knitting needles.

442
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:58,560
And somehow she is managing to make knitting look angry.

443
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Out of the corner of her eyes, she just keeps darting her eyes over and stabbing them into the corner where Beck keeps his camera equipment,

444
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:20,560
which is not there at the time, but there's like a whole corner of this room that is specifically set up to house Beck's livelihood.

445
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:26,560
Oh, yeah. You can tell exactly where it is just by all the scuff marks and the skirting board and the floor tiles.

446
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:36,560
And the last you saw Beck, it was maybe even yesterday, because today you knew that he was in his bedroom.

447
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:44,560
You knew that he, you know, had been sleeping in, but you went to knock on his door for tea or snack or he wasn't even in there.

448
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:52,560
He just left the house without saying anything. And as those thoughts are flowing through your brain, the front door swings open.

449
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:59,560
Hey Ma, you're up. Oh, this is awkward.

450
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:12,560
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. I thought that was a burglar coming in, but no, it's just my son staying out all hours again.

451
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,560
And where have you been tonight, young man?

452
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:22,560
Get some drinks with the boys. You know, it's... I had a bad night, Mama.

453
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:28,560
Yes, I can smell just how bad your night was from here. Yes.

454
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,560
You're not going to bed until you put something in your stomach to soak up some of that beer.

455
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:43,560
There's still some hot dog casserole in the oven. It's probably, oh, it's probably burnt to a crisp by now.

456
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:48,560
But, well, give it a try. Cut up the wieners nice and small, just the way you like it.

457
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,560
Just the way I like it. Cut up more hot dogs.

458
00:28:53,560 --> 00:29:00,560
Beck starts walking toward the fridge and you can tell now that he's a little drunker even than you've ever seen him.

459
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:06,560
He's a stumble-ier than you've ever seen him. And he kind of catches himself, woo, a little woozy.

460
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:17,560
Sorry. Sorry about that, Ma. I know we don't like to talk about like what I do, but like I saw some shit tonight, Mom. It was bad.

461
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,560
And what exactly did you see?

462
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:30,560
Oh, it's kind of like a thing that's like under investigation now. I don't know if like I might need a lawyer to talk to you about it.

463
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:37,560
Honestly, I really don't understand why you can't have a proper job. You're out all hours.

464
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:46,560
I never know whether I'm going to find you sleeping in your room in the middle of the afternoon or whether you're going to stay out until three o'clock in the morning.

465
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:51,560
Clearly, what you're doing isn't making you enough money for you to actually move into your own place.

466
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:56,560
And now you're saying that it's dangerous as well and it's going to get you into trouble.

467
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,560
Why do you do this? Why can't you just get a proper job?

468
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:13,560
You know, Macey Grindel's son, Deke, he's got he's got a nice thriving business for himself selling secondhand sofa beds and he's moved into a new apartment downtown.

469
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:20,560
It's all his own. Well, I think he's got a couple of flatmates, but he's not living with his mother anymore. That's the important thing.

470
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:28,560
Yeah, but Deke's a fucking asshole. Oh, not this again. Jesus Christ.

471
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,560
He's a financially solvent asshole.

472
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,560
Sorry, the internet connection cut out a little bit right there.

473
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:47,560
He's a financially solvent asshole.

474
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,560
Brilliant.

475
00:30:50,560 --> 00:31:01,560
As Kim started to go into that diatribe, Beck had his back to her and he was kind of mouthing along with these words. He's heard it so many times.

476
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:08,560
Oh, she's got to mention Deke again. She's got to mention Deke. Oh, there we go.

477
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:14,560
If you love Deke so much, why didn't you give birth to him?

478
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:22,560
Don't think that I haven't thought about that every day. Ew, gross, mom. You think about fucking Deke's dad?

479
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,560
A wistful look crosses Kim's eyes.

480
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:31,560
Oh my God.

481
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:40,560
For like half a second, I thought we were going to get something really meaningful when Kim was like, why do you even do this job?

482
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:48,560
And then Beck's like, go fuck my friend's dad.

483
00:31:48,560 --> 00:32:00,560
At this point, Beck has lost the gusto for the hot dog casserole and is just kind of like slopping it onto a plate and throwing it in the microwave and is trying his best to like avoid eye contact with you.

484
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:07,560
Look, Ma, I know that it's like not like the best paying thing in the world, but it's like what I want to do.

485
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:14,560
Like, I don't know if you can understand like happiness from that perspective, but that's what I've got for me right now.

486
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:29,560
Look, you've got to understand that part of being a grown up is that we all have to do things that we don't want to do, because that's just how we get through life.

487
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:37,560
And yes, all right, you can run around doing your camera stuff and whatever it is you do at three o'clock in the morning.

488
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:44,560
And I try not to judge you, but sooner or later, you've got to grow up.

489
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:50,560
You can't just carry on like this and pretend that everything's all right.

490
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:55,560
You've got to you've got to grow up someday, boy.

491
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:02,560
Beck is now kind of a little more solemn and a little more introspective visually.

492
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:07,560
And he pulls the food out of the microwave and he's holding the plate and he's kind of picking at it with a fork.

493
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:13,560
Yeah, I mean, fine. We disagree on like fundamental things, Ma.

494
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:23,560
I just maybe someday you'll see that I can I can do this and also like be successful, whatever that means to you.

495
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,560
I'm going to my room.

496
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,560
All right. You'll have to pick up the clean sheets.

497
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,560
I've left them out for you, but you'll have to make the bed yourself.

498
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:42,560
And I tried to get the stains out, but we're going to have to try a new brand.

499
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:48,560
Yeah, OK, thanks. Thanks, Mommy. You got any milk?

500
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,560
Sounds a bit flogging.

501
00:33:53,560 --> 00:34:06,560
Scott, we didn't bring you on here to roleplay anything other than what's about to happen.

502
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:15,560
Scott, thank you so much. I think I think that's perfect.

503
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,560
Scott, as always, an absolute pleasure.

504
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:25,560
Oh, thank you. Zach, we live in a weird, privileged world that we just had Scott Dorward on to play with my mom.

505
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:31,560
And I said, thanks, Mommy. Got any milk?

506
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,560
And then we said, have a good day.

507
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:39,560
That is good to hold me.

508
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,560
All right, Scott, thank you so much. Seriously, thank you so much.

509
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:49,560
And for those of you who enjoyed Scott just now, you can hear him.

510
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:55,560
He runs two different full scenarios for us on pretending to be people in our bonus episodes.

511
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,560
Episodes? Episodes?

512
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:04,560
Here on the main feed, Scott, you ran Bleak Prospect, a Call of Cthulhu scenario that you wrote so fucking creepy.

513
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,560
It's one of my favorite things that we've done on the show.

514
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,560
Starts in a Hoover town and goes to worse places.

515
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:19,560
And you also recently ran a Pulp Cthulhu scenario, both of which, by the way, that Scott wrote.

516
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,560
This one was A New Age of Wonders.

517
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:29,560
And that was, for me personally, I think one of my absolute favorite player experiences I've ever had in an RPG.

518
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:34,560
Oh, man. Oh, I'm glad you liked it. I had an absolute blast running it.

519
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,560
We did, too.

520
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,560
That's so fun.

521
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,560
All right, well, I'm going to stop gushing and we'll see you soon, Scott.

522
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,560
Oh, marvelous. Look forward to it.

523
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,560
Good night, Mommy.

524
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,560
Oh, God. I've got to go and have a bath now.

525
00:35:51,560 --> 00:36:03,560
We're Team Press! We're Team Press! We're Team Press! We're Team Press! We're Team Press! We're Team Press!

526
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,560
If you're just now joining us, welcome back to Pretending to Be People.

527
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,560
We are here with a special guest right now.

528
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:20,560
It is the GM of the Lost Mountain Saga, one of the best players from Glass Cannon Networks, and droids, and aliens.

529
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,560
It is Eleanor de Lorenzo.

530
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,560
Let's get one that the people can hear.

531
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:37,560
It's fun to talk like this, but I don't know if anybody can understand Eleanor de Lorenzo.

532
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,560
Hey, Ellie.

533
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:46,560
Hello. I understood. There were compliments in that. I understood that. I sucked that up right up.

534
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,560
I picked those out right away.

535
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,560
Thank you so much for coming back on.

536
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,560
Ellie, thank you so much for coming and joining us again.

537
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,560
Oh, dude. I'm so excited to be back. Thank you for inviting me.

538
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,560
If you're listening to this and you haven't heard Ellie on Pretending to Be People before,

539
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:07,560
Ellie was a guest and a player when I ran a homebrew scenario that I wrote, Bigfoot Underground Search and Hunt.

540
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:12,560
for her and some other guest players, and we had an absolutely phenomenal time.

541
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,560
You were such a wonderful player that I was so excited to bring you back on.

542
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:22,560
But another huge reason that I was so excited to bring you on is when I told Thomas, I was like,

543
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,560
Hey, dude, Ellie from A&A is coming on Pretending to Be People.

544
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:33,560
Yeah, and then you had her play with a bunch of people who weren't fans of that show.

545
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:37,560
Which as a fan was like, well, that's a bummer.

546
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:43,560
Couldn't have anyone except me getting too starstruck on her first appearance on Pretending to Be People.

547
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,560
Fair enough. You wanted to protect her from...

548
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,560
From what's about to happen, yes.

549
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,560
From the slobbering idiots of the PTBP pod.

550
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:58,560
I love slobbering idiots, though. That's what I'm more comfortable with, you know what I'm saying?

551
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,560
Now I played with very talented, wonderful women and they were all great, but I will say...

552
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,560
That sounds deeply intimidating.

553
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,560
Intimidating, yeah.

554
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,560
They were hot. They stared at me with their hot eyes.

555
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,560
And one of them was apparently married to you, Zach.

556
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,560
That is correct, yeah, apparently.

557
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,560
Apparently.

558
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,560
Apparently?

559
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,560
Yeah, allegedly married.

560
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,560
Allegedly, Taylor and her hot eyes are married to Zach.

561
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,560
I'm an allegedly lucky man.

562
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:35,560
Okay. I'm not going to correct that because I'm waiting for all the chinks in your marriage's armor to collapse at once.

563
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,560
Coming in hot. Coming in hot. Love it.

564
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,560
I'll have to beat Luke off, but...

565
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,560
Wow, I'd watch that.

566
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,560
So, Thomas, are you married?

567
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,560
Uh, no. No, I'm not married.

568
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,560
You said that very quickly, no. It was like a gut reaction, no.

569
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,560
Well, I remembered that I wasn't.

570
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,560
Oh, right. Well...

571
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,560
You looked back at your whole life and you thought...

572
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,560
Did I leave a wife somewhere?

573
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,560
Along the road?

574
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,560
It's like when people ask you if you're like, do you have any kids?

575
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,560
And you're like, not that I'm aware of.

576
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,560
It's like, do you have a wife? Not that I'm aware of.

577
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,560
Not that I'm aware of.

578
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:19,560
I'm known for not knowing much about America and I just realized that I know you guys are from a state.

579
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,560
But I don't remember which state right this second.

580
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,560
Is it Missouri?

581
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,560
Yeah.

582
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,560
Wow.

583
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,560
I was going to make a joke about you have a one in 50 shot, so just go for it.

584
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,560
You fucking nailed it.

585
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,560
I did.

586
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,560
Got it in one.

587
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,560
It is indeed Missouri, which we like, but a lot of people don't.

588
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,560
Oh, yeah. We love it.

589
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,560
It's nice here. It's really hot right now, actually. It sucks here.

590
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,560
Oh, but still, I would love to go.

591
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:52,560
But is it nice because it's like, you know, you can be on a horse ranch and...

592
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,560
I'm sorry.

593
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,560
Yeah, you can be on a horse ranch.

594
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,560
Okay.

595
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:03,560
Well, I mean, I don't make very much money and this is my house that we're recording in.

596
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:11,560
Oh, screw you and making fun of my bullshit New York studio cabin.

597
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,560
But that's true.

598
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,560
That's a really cool thing about Missouri.

599
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,560
You have an actual kitchen. I love that.

600
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,560
I want a Missouri kitchen.

601
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,560
Let's get into Cal, Colorado.

602
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,560
Cal, you've had a very interesting night.

603
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:32,560
I want to dive back into some of the things that you've seen here on this random night.

604
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,560
I don't.

605
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:38,560
Oh, yeah. That makes sense because one of these memories that keeps just blasting into your head

606
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:46,560
as you're leaving the foundry is just this headless, almost headless neck

607
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,560
held on by a couple of tendons and skin on ones.

608
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:58,560
Your mind drifts immediately from this severed neck off to your daughter.

609
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,560
A little bit. Mostly my mind is just shouting neck hole, neck hole, neck hole

610
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,560
as I see like this horrifying like red flash and this image of this nearly headless neck.

611
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,560
Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as you get into your car.

612
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:16,560
Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as you drive really far back to your home.

613
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,560
Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole, neck hole everywhere.

614
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,560
Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as you sit into your chair.

615
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,560
And he turns on a 24-hour news channel like he always does.

616
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,560
Natch. Drown it out, baby.

617
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,560
Honestly, the cleaning person must have turned it off because he kind of likes to just keep it on all day.

618
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:41,560
But yeah, he turns that on. He goes over to his pretty dusty home bar.

619
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:48,560
He grabs a glass and takes a bottle of cheap white wine out of the refrigerator

620
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,560
and pours it to the brim and then downs that and pours another.

621
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,560
And at that moment, you feel a vibration coming from your pocket

622
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:02,560
and it's not the vibration of a text or a call. Do you not have a phone that vibrates?

623
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,560
No, he does, but we don't do vibrates here. We have a ring on this podcast.

624
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,560
That's right.

625
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,560
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

626
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,560
Yeah, he hears the ringtone set to his daughter, Carol.

627
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:22,560
Eleanor de Lorenzo, what does Carol's face look like on the screen of Cal's phone here?

628
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,560
It's a young woman, young 20s.

629
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:30,560
She currently looks a little flushed, as if she might have been, I don't know, working out or something.

630
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,560
But since Saturday night, you might assume that she might be a little tipsy.

631
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:39,560
And she's sitting down on a couch that you recognize to be her student room.

632
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,560
Hey!

633
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:51,560
Carol, it's lovely to hear from you. I'm sorry, I've had kind of an extraordinary evening.

634
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,560
Honey, how are you?

635
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:58,560
Dad, can you tilt your phone up a little bit? I can't see you.

636
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,560
Like you're filming your forehead again.

637
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,560
He tilts it down and you can just see his chin.

638
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,560
Is this better?

639
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,560
No, please.

640
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,560
You remember, like you can put it a little bit further away from your face. That works better.

641
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,560
You just see one giant eye as he's looking into the camera lens.

642
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,560
Alright, and she puts down the phone and it's just voiceover.

643
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:28,560
Honey, I'd love to see your darling face, especially with you so far away from home.

644
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,560
Please explain FaceTime to me.

645
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,560
Oh, Dad, have you been drinking?

646
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:44,560
Just a little wine. It's a Saturday night. I'm a single man. Can I not enjoy a sifter of wine?

647
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,560
No, of course. Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you a little bit about.

648
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,560
I wondered if you... Have you been doing anything fun lately? Like, except working?

649
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:57,560
Work is fun, sweetie. Your mother and I always tried to tell you that.

650
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:06,560
No, I know. I know. I just... I don't know. I worry about you. That's why... I just wish you, you know, would get out there a little bit.

651
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:12,560
Cal thinks about where he just got out to and pauses and he kind of gulps and he's like,

652
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:18,560
I get out, sweetie. Just today I saw some corn wrestling while I was out on assignment.

653
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:24,560
They also had crabs. Not the men. The farm. They raised corn and crabs.

654
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,560
Alright.

655
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,560
So I get out.

656
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:37,560
Yeah, no, I get it. I know. I just... I don't know if you... I'm sure you already heard, but Mom, I think... Mom's seeing someone.

657
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:43,560
Yes, I heard. He's quite a bit younger, too. I heard he was 40.

658
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:49,560
Yeah, but, I mean, after you turn 25, it's like age doesn't matter anymore.

659
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,560
Oh.

660
00:44:51,560 --> 00:45:00,560
She says that with 100% sincerity because she thinks that if you're over 25, you're ancient.

661
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:05,560
And you can tell that suddenly Carol seems a little bit nervous.

662
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,560
Yeah, I don't know.

663
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,560
Is there something else on your mind, sweetie?

664
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,560
Well, promise you won't get angry.

665
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,560
I promise.

666
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:23,560
Well, you know that I always wanted to make you happy, and that's why I went to journalism school.

667
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:29,560
Of course. Just like your mother and I, you went on to journalism school to continue the family business.

668
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,560
Which is your ultimate dream and desire, of course, right?

669
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:40,560
Right. But, well, I've decided, and she suddenly gets defensive as if she's ready to fight.

670
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,560
I've decided that I'm not going to do that anymore.

671
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:49,560
I've decided that I am going to pursue something else, something that I am passionate about.

672
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:53,560
And it's not journalism, it's not writing, it's not any of that.

673
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:59,560
I have decided I'm going to become a nature photographer.

674
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:04,560
Well, sweetie, that's... that's wonderful.

675
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,560
Really?

676
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:09,560
You know, photography is still technically journalism.

677
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,560
No, no, okay, what...

678
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:17,560
Sweetheart, I just want you to know that no matter what you choose,

679
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:25,560
even if you're not a world-class news anchor like me or a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist like your mother,

680
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:36,560
we're happy that what you have chosen is still inexplicably linked to the nexus of reporting and,

681
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,560
well, you know, showing the truth of our world to the people.

682
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,560
That's what it's all about.

683
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:45,560
Okay, well, see, see, that was like... I knew that you were going to react like that,

684
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:49,560
so now I'm going to tell you the real... my real job.

685
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,560
A bait and switch.

686
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:55,560
I'm going to tell you the real... it's still related to photography.

687
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,560
Yeah?

688
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:04,560
But it's like for, like, beautiful women posing without clothing.

689
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,560
Pornography?

690
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,560
Pornography?

691
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,560
No, it's not pornography.

692
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,560
Carolina?

693
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,560
It's not pornography.

694
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,560
It's boudoir photography.

695
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,560
Oh, I'm sorry.

696
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:20,560
Nerd pornography.

697
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,560
See, this is the thing.

698
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,560
You never understand.

699
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,560
You mock everything I do.

700
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,560
That's the problem with you and mom.

701
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,560
You're both academics and I don't want to be involved with this.

702
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,560
Like, I don't want to go to school anymore.

703
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,560
I'm going to buy my camera.

704
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:36,560
I'm going to take pictures of my friends and they will pay me eventually.

705
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,560
And then I'll start an Instagram account and I'm going to make a lot of money.

706
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,560
And there's nothing you can say or do.

707
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,560
And, yeah.

708
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,560
Roll a grip check, Dad.

709
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,560
No, I think he's...

710
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,560
No, no, no. This is...

711
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,560
Hold on.

712
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,560
This is specifically because of what you've seen tonight

713
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,560
and the amount of grip that you lost.

714
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,560
It is going to affect the relationships that you have.

715
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,560
Yeah, I know, but what I was just about to say was all about that.

716
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,560
Oh, okay.

717
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,560
And why it actually wouldn't.

718
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:05,560
Well, that's part of the game is you have to roll to do that.

719
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,560
Yeah, he hates the dice.

720
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,560
But he succeeds.

721
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,560
Okay, yeah.

722
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,560
All fair enough.

723
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:17,560
So you see from the part of your father's chin that you can't see.

724
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,560
It, like, quivers a little bit.

725
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,560
But then he composes itself and he says,

726
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:28,560
Honey, your mother and I will support you no matter what you choose to do.

727
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,560
We only want you to be happy.

728
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:36,560
And tonight I saw some horrible things that I can never unsee.

729
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:41,560
If you can make beautiful art and put it into this world,

730
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,560
that is enough for me.

731
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:47,560
You're going to want to approach this more carefully with your mother.

732
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,560
We may not tell her until you've graduated.

733
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,560
Well, I'm not going to graduate. That's the thing.

734
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,560
Right, right, right.

735
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:57,560
Until you burlesque photography.

736
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:03,560
Well, this is a whole new world for me, pumpkin.

737
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,560
So, Dad, are you all right?

738
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,560
You said you've seen some horrible stuff.

739
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,560
I didn't see a neck hole.

740
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,560
Sorry, one of the wrestlers broke his arm.

741
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,560
It bent the wrong way.

742
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,560
It was gnarly.

743
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:22,560
I love that Cal picked up the word gnarly from Beck.

744
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,560
Oh, no, Jesus. Is he going to be okay?

745
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,560
Yes, sweetie, I think he'll be fine.

746
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,560
Everything will be fine in the world.

747
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,560
And you will, no matter what you choose to do,

748
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,560
you will be an important contributing part of it.

749
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,560
And your mother and I love you very deeply.

750
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,560
Well, I love you too, Dad.

751
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,560
And she's starting to get worried.

752
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,560
Like, wow, he really needs to start getting out there.

753
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,560
I don't know, Dad, I know it's not my business,

754
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,560
but I think it would be good for you to, like,

755
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,560
there are apps you can download that would, like,

756
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,560
match you with other women.

757
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,560
I just don't want you to be, like, be alone.

758
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,560
I'm not alone, sweetie.

759
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,560
I have you. I have my memories.

760
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,560
He points to all the pictures around the house.

761
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,560
Oh, my God.

762
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,560
See, that's the definition of being alone.

763
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:17,560
But I will try to get out there more.

764
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,560
What are these women apps you told me about?

765
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,560
Well, one of them is called Bumble.

766
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,560
Bumble?

767
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,560
I mean, like, when you've downloaded them, let me know

768
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,560
and I'll give you some advice because you can't be, like,

769
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:33,560
don't start commenting on women's profiles like a weirdo.

770
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,560
How do you comment like a normal-o?

771
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,560
Well, you just wait for them to, like,

772
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,560
you put up a nice picture of yourself

773
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,560
and then you write something nice about you,

774
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,560
like you're an established journalist,

775
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,560
and then you wait for women to contact you.

776
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,560
Is there an app that finds me a woman exactly like your mother?

777
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,560
Oh, no.

778
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,560
Dad.

779
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,560
What?

780
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,560
No.

781
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,560
Maybe you should go for the complete opposite.

782
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,560
Like a guy?

783
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,560
Well, maybe.

784
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,560
I don't know, man.

785
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:16,560
Carol, I promise you, I will look into online dating.

786
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,560
Carol, exciting news.

787
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,560
Do you post your boudoir pictures on TikTok?

788
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,560
Well, okay.

789
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,560
So, Dad, you can't follow my friends.

790
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,560
Like, they are not part of the dating pool.

791
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,560
Is that why you're asking?

792
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,560
No, no.

793
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,560
Have you heard of this?

794
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,560
Have you heard of TikTok?

795
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,560
Of course I've heard about TikTok.

796
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,560
Oh, I'm sorry.

797
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,560
Well, I learned about it today and I did a dance.

798
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,560
No, no.

799
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,560
Carol, no, you should see the dance I did.

800
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,560
It's posted on the Cannes TikTok for the station.

801
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,560
People liked it.

802
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,560
You'll see, I'm out there.

803
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,560
Hey, Carol, when you pull it up on your phone,

804
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,560
you see it's called the Calzone.

805
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,560
Oh, God.

806
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,560
Oh, God.

807
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:00,560
And he's doing a dance with a random guy on the street

808
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,560
who's doing a very cool dance

809
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,560
where it looks like he's sitting while he's upright

810
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,560
and dancing around in a sitting position.

811
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,560
And Cal does it perfectly alongside of him.

812
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,560
Wow, Dad, actually, that's pretty impressive.

813
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,560
You should, actually, you should keep doing that.

814
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,560
In a weird, twisted reality that we currently live in,

815
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:23,560
you would actually find more dates based on this video.

816
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,560
With women like your mother?

817
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,560
Women like my mom, sure.

818
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,560
But you should not narrow your, like,

819
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,560
there are plenty of women out there that aren't like mom.

820
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,560
Oh, well, that's the problem.

821
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,560
All right, Dad.

822
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:46,560
I have to go, but thank you for being supportive of my choices.

823
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,560
Try to get some sleep and then maybe we'll,

824
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,560
yeah, I'll check in with you tomorrow.

825
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,560
But I still, until I have some money,

826
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:57,560
maybe don't cancel my credit card yet.

827
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,560
I wouldn't dream of it, sweetie.

828
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,560
But again, don't tell your mother

829
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,560
she would cancel them in a heartbeat.

830
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,560
Thanks, Dad.

831
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,560
Yeah, take care of yourself and I'll talk to you tomorrow.

832
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,560
I love you very much.

833
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,560
I love you too, Dad.

834
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,560
And I, yeah, thank you.

835
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,560
Thank you.

836
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,560
This has been Cal Colorado.

837
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,560
Have a pleasant evening.

838
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,560
You really don't have, okay, fine.

839
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,560
Ellie, thank you so much for coming on the show.

840
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,560
Yeah, thank you, Ellie.

841
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,560
Oh, my God. That was great.

842
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,560
That was fun.

843
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,560
I'm very much looking forward to seeing

844
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:39,560
how this relationship thrives or...

845
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,560
Yeah, it was very, like, I love how, like,

846
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,560
I expected Zach to come in and be like,

847
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,560
and then all of a sudden her head falls off

848
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,560
and I'm like, she dies.

849
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,560
And I'm like, okay, cool.

850
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,560
We got a long ways to go.

851
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,560
We got time to fuck this shit up.

852
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,560
Yeah, there can definitely be a phone call

853
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,560
where your head falls off.

854
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,560
Hey, if that's what you want.

855
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,560
Is season two a homebrew as well?

856
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,560
Yeah.

857
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:01,560
Yeah, very nice.

858
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,560
It's all I can do.

859
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:03,560
I don't like reading.

860
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,560
You actually can't.

861
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,560
I'm too stupid.

862
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,560
It's a shame.

863
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,560
Life is great.

864
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,560
And it's all my fault.
