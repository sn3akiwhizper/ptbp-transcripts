147.36 213.52 speaker0  Last time the field team at City Action News showed the good people of TikTok a glimpse into the calzone on their way to a potential story from a woman named Kaylee Silver. After watching footage from the Furbo it's clear that Kaylee Silver walked over to her fridge, cracked a beer and her friend Kaylee Gold's head unnaturally snapped toward the kitchen before this differently dispositioned Kaylee Gold lunged at the apartments resident Kaylee Silver. The attack took place out of view behind the kitchen counter but it seems Kaylee Silver stabbed her friend repeatedly in the neck with her broken beer bottle until Kaylee Gold's head was all but decapitated. Thankfully for this story the Cannes crew called the city cops, made statements and headed off to cleanse their palates with a drink at the foundry.
212.28 267.88 speaker1  handsome. Everyone from season one is dead to this podcast, Luke.
266.88 274.08 speaker3  What's season one?
271.40 281.56 speaker1  Welcome back to season two of Pretending to be People.
279.60 310.66 speaker3  over and done. And this is a new era of excellence and groundbreaking podcast roleplay, so fucking get your two Stop listening right now. Stop. Yeah, you need to stop. The britches this, oh, I feel like I'm, am I clipping for you guys? A little bit.
309.66 315.78 speaker2  I feel very loud. I'll just talk louder.
313.90 317.02 speaker3  Oh, the cats, the cats going in the pod box.
315.78 325.62 speaker2  Cat in the pod box. I will say main difference...
320.48 330.02 speaker3  After listening to the edited version of the first episode of this season.
329.02 333.82 speaker2  Exactly. That was the big difference I noticed.
331.02 359.56 speaker3  But after listening to that, huge differences. The britches are going to be small this year. This years. They were big last time and now they're small. Oh, okay. Nevermind. Zach is currently... That cat is going to leave. Zach is, yeah, aggressively kissing our cat.
356.56 364.56 speaker2  Aggressively kissing the top of Niko Case's head.
361.56 380.56 speaker3  And then the fifth time she was like, I'm not going to sit on this f***ing couch with So obviously I know the answer to this, but Joe, where exactly did we leave off last time?
375.56 397.56 speaker2  A girl killed another girl in an apartment and it was messed up. And we were all kind of exasperated by it. It's a reference to what, Zach?
395.56 411.56 speaker3  Oh, it's a reference to what, Thomas? I don't remember exactly, but isn't it a newsman's bar? I believe it's a bar specifically for newsman's. That's right. I remember the whole thing. I knew the whole time I knew that. So, vroom vroom?
410.56 420.56 speaker2  Vroom vroom.
414.56 424.56 speaker3  Julius Summers pulls into the parking lot of the foundry.
422.56 438.56 speaker2  What kind of bar is this?
432.56 447.56 speaker3  And it's kind of maybe equidistant downtown from the three different local news stations. And so they all come and relax and unwind there and talk shop afterwards.
444.56 453.56 speaker2  Are there any TVs on the walls at all?
447.56 494.56 speaker3  Are they showing the news at this place or is it specifically to unwind away from that? I think the foundry is in an older building downtown, but just absolutely always in the shadow of these skyscrapers.
485.56 513.56 speaker2  So pretty much every time this foundry is rumbling with the train that is basically right outside its back door.
509.56 521.56 speaker3  You have to lean in close. It's a great place to protect your sources.
513.56 539.56 speaker2  In your mind, is this place filled with producers and talent or is my ilk of the camera man and crew there? Cullerton, KY3, any of the other ones?
529.56 547.56 speaker3  I don't think we're referencing specific networks, but it would definitely be the local ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, local anchor people all hanging out there.
545.56 549.56 speaker2  ETC is there.
547.56 555.56 speaker3  ETC, which is...
554.56 561.56 speaker2  Television. Television channel.
559.56 581.56 speaker3  Joe, did you do one? Barbecue. Yeah, Royal Broadcasting. Quarterly.
579.56 602.56 speaker2  Anyway... Does Beck say that?
597.56 604.56 speaker3  Julius pulls in, as any normal person would, into a parking spot.
602.56 643.56 speaker2  But as he's doing it, he goes... The high rise that you were just at. I bet you we pull in a little somber. I think that this is a sacred place that he knows not to film. Nice. And that's a very out of character for him. So you guys walk across...
640.56 664.56 speaker3  This is like where the witches and the witch hunters meet. Also smoking? Yes.
661.56 693.56 speaker2  The humidity kind of dies off into the night. And you've got kind of a cool summer evening as you guys walk across this gravel parking lot. And head around back to the entrance of the foundry on the train track side. A train is currently finishing up. It's bustling through this back area. And you see a server is haphazardly making their way through the smokers outside with train shots.
691.56 711.56 speaker3  Who had the train shots? Nice.
707.56 724.56 speaker2  Which train shots are specifically a special here at the foundry. Whisky. Whisky.
723.56 729.56 speaker3  Oh god.
728.56 781.56 speaker2  Oh, it's Old Grandad. Brown Derby Select. It's Old Grandad. It's Old Grandad. Oh yeah. Probably like we recognize.
779.56 791.56 speaker3  Are they just like local news crew?
783.56 801.56 speaker2  They hold up their shots to you as they all wait on the other two shots to come which come quickly and you're all able to.
799.56 835.56 speaker3  I'm very excited. Like he gives a very knowing look to Beck. I think you know what that means, Beck.
833.56 883.56 speaker2  You're going to have fun tonight, dude. It's going to be good for you. Probably, yeah. I think that'd be cool.
881.56 902.56 speaker3  so he knows which booth it is. I'm just going and sitting down and turning around like, look what I know.
901.56 947.56 speaker2  Hey, that's the one we always sit at. That's weird, dude. Cool. Hanging Wes Anderson-style directly center frame of the booth is an old picture of Cal from the night after his first television broadcast as a head news anchor. And it's beautifully framed in this old oak wooden frame and is sitting gloriously. He looks like a kid. The suit's wearing him.
942.56 993.56 speaker3  with a huge smile on his face next to that aged 30 years and looking absolutely miserable tonight. He just doesn't want to catch sight of it. Sure, sure, sure. but wiggling with excitement. He's wanted to do this for so long. Just be a producer and be part of the news and be able to get into this place. He is so fucking stoked. Julius, if you wiggle like that during the printing press, you could lose a finger. Printing press. I want to find out what it is. Your research didn't tell you what it is.
991.56 1003.56 speaker2  I don't think that anybody goes out there just telling other people about it, you know? They never do, if they want to live.
1000.56 1021.56 speaker3  It's a process that happens in three steps. and your belly is exposed. Julius pulls his shirt up as he lays on the table and then realizes what was said, and then he goes and sits back down again.
1019.56 1031.56 speaker2  Tell them the second part. Well, this is kind of like your last moment of choice here, but you get to decide what liquor you want. Once you're laying on the bar with your shirt up?
1030.56 1067.56 speaker1  Uh-huh. Tequila.
1066.56 1128.56 speaker3  And your belly button. On my belly button. And they let the older interns just absolutely go at you. While he's like untucking his shirt from his pants. he strikes me as a very pale man. He's pretty pale, yeah.
1126.56 1148.56 speaker2  A vest of a woman in a denim trunk. And in a long braid down the back of her hair. And she's like... Hot off the press.
1146.56 1169.56 speaker1  Oh, that's right. We got a newbie over at City Action News. Come on down. He's in for the printing press.
1167.56 1184.56 speaker2  And the entire crowd... And these very dorky...
1182.56 1214.56 speaker3  And they all look like Jonah from Veep. And Julius... Julius is laying on the bar with his shirt kind of pulled up. Exposing his stomach.
1211.56 1350.56 speaker2  Much like Julius's memories. Joe and I had talked about who his character would interact with the most. And your answer to that was... This isn't the first time I've been called a mother, but at least the circumstances are different. For those of you who are just hearing Scott on Pretending to Be People for the first time for some fucking reason. Scott is my parasocial RPG mentor. He didn't know that he was my mentor. truly developed me into the GM that I am today. And I am super appreciative of all the lessons I've learned listening to their podcast over the years.
1345.56 1367.56 speaker1  and you answered some questions for him one time, and he was so excited and told us all about it.
1360.56 1408.56 speaker2  which is a scenario that you wrote for the book The Things We Leave Behind by Stigine Fox Publishing.
1402.56 1454.56 speaker1  Some might say this podcast wouldn't exist without you, Scott. You gave him the hope, the drive. Oh, it's all my fault now, is it?
1451.56 1463.56 speaker2  Quite noisy. I'm going to move it into the back room.
1457.56 1480.56 speaker1  I barely get through a recording session without one of my cats running into the room and screaming like a seagull, or jumping all over things and knocking shit over. Yep. My cats are named Chaos and Anarchy and it's with good reason.
1475.56 1515.56 speaker2  Beck Wilder has had a brutal day. He had a rough evening? Was it evening? Yeah, it was a rough evening. You were called out for a potential story that was...
1509.56 1534.56 speaker1  It was a terrible, terrible crime scene, including a partially severed head. Yeah. That wasn't what Beck was thinking was going to happen that day. Yeah, I mean, a severed head is bad enough. A partially severed head sounds worse.
1533.56 1543.56 speaker2  Just a little hinge.
1538.56 1570.56 speaker1  He's now just gotten back from the foundry where he had a nice night trying to drink his troubles away. He's maybe a little bit looser than normal, but he kind of lives in an equilibrium of inebriation.
1559.56 1574.56 speaker2  So as you arrive home, it's late at night. It's 1130 PM, maybe even midnight, which is about as late in the night as you can get.
1573.56 1629.56 speaker1  That's right. The sound is way down on the TV and there's just the clack, clack, clack of knitting needles.
1620.56 1695.56 speaker2  Out of the corner of her eyes, she just keeps darting her eyes over and stabbing them into the corner where Beck keeps his camera equipment, which is not there at the time, but there's like a whole corner of this room that is specifically set up to house Beck's livelihood.
1692.56 1723.56 speaker1  And where have you been tonight, young man?
1715.56 1746.56 speaker4  There's still some hot dog casserole in the oven. It's probably, oh, it's probably burnt to a crisp by now. But, well, give it a try. Cut up the wieners nice and small, just the way you like it.
1740.56 1786.56 speaker1  He's a stumble-ier than you've ever seen him. And he kind of catches himself, woo, a little woozy.
1777.56 1934.56 speaker4  I never know whether I'm going to find you sleeping in your room in the middle of the afternoon or whether you're going to stay out until three o'clock in the morning. Clearly, what you're doing isn't making you enough money for you to actually move into your own place. And now you're saying that it's dangerous as well and it's going to get you into trouble. Why do you do this? Why can't you just get a proper job? You know, Macey Grindel's son, Deke, he's got he's got a nice thriving business for himself selling secondhand sofa beds and he's moved into a new apartment downtown. It's all his own. Well, I think he's got a couple of flatmates, but he's not living with his mother anymore. That's the important thing.
1927.56 1957.56 speaker1  Like, I don't know if you can understand like happiness from that perspective, but that's what I've got for me right now.
1949.56 1987.56 speaker4  And yes, all right, you can run around doing your camera stuff and whatever it is you do at three o'clock in the morning. And I try not to judge you, but sooner or later, you've got to grow up. You can't just carry on like this and pretend that everything's all right. You've got to you've got to grow up someday, boy.
1982.56 2003.56 speaker1  And he pulls the food out of the microwave and he's holding the plate and he's kind of picking at it with a fork.
1993.56 2011.56 speaker5  I just maybe someday you'll see that I can I can do this and also like be successful, whatever that means to you. I'm going to my room.
2008.56 2058.56 speaker4  I've left them out for you, but you'll have to make the bed yourself.
2055.56 2073.56 speaker2  Scott, as always, an absolute pleasure.
2071.56 2095.56 speaker1  And then we said, have a good day.
2089.56 2269.56 speaker2  He runs two different full scenarios for us on pretending to be people in our bonus episodes. And you also recently ran a Pulp Cthulhu scenario, both of which, by the way, that Scott wrote. This one was A New Age of Wonders. And that was, for me personally, I think one of my absolute favorite player experiences I've ever had in an RPG. Oh, marvelous. Look forward to it. We are here with a special guest right now. It is the GM of the Lost Mountain Saga, one of the best players from Glass Cannon Networks, and droids, and aliens. It is Eleanor de Lorenzo. If you're listening to this and you haven't heard Ellie on Pretending to Be People before, for her and some other guest players, and we had an absolutely phenomenal time. You were such a wonderful player that I was so excited to bring you back on. But another huge reason that I was so excited to bring you on is when I told Thomas, I was like, Hey, dude, Ellie from A&A is coming on Pretending to Be People.
2266.56 2284.56 speaker3  From what's about to happen, yes. Now I played with very talented, wonderful women and they were all great, but I will say...
2283.56 2286.56 speaker2  That sounds deeply intimidating.
2284.56 2296.56 speaker3  Intimidating, yeah.
2295.56 2332.56 speaker2  Apparently. Yeah, allegedly married.
2328.56 2372.56 speaker5  You said that very quickly, no. It was like a gut reaction, no. It's like when people ask you if you're like, do you have any kids? And you're like, not that I'm aware of. It's like, do you have a wife? Not that I'm aware of. I'm known for not knowing much about America and I just realized that I know you guys are from a state. But I don't remember which state right this second. Is it Missouri?
2371.56 2392.56 speaker3  You fucking nailed it.
2386.56 2395.56 speaker5  But is it nice because it's like, you know, you can be on a horse ranch and...
2393.56 2412.56 speaker3  Yeah, you can be on a horse ranch.
2411.56 2414.56 speaker5  But that's true.
2412.56 2417.56 speaker2  That's a really cool thing about Missouri.
2414.56 2432.56 speaker5  You have an actual kitchen. I love that.
2427.56 2468.56 speaker2  I want to dive back into some of the things that you've seen here on this random night. I don't. as you're leaving the foundry is just this headless, almost headless neck held on by a couple of tendons and skin on ones.
2462.56 2476.56 speaker3  as I see like this horrifying like red flash and this image of this nearly headless neck.
2471.56 2508.56 speaker2  Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as you drive really far back to your home. Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole, neck hole everywhere. Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as you sit into your chair.
2502.56 2522.56 speaker3  He grabs a glass and takes a bottle of cheap white wine out of the refrigerator and pours it to the brim and then downs that and pours another.
2517.56 2545.56 speaker2  and it's not the vibration of a text or a call. Do you not have a phone that vibrates? That's right. Ring, ring, ring, ring.
2542.56 2573.56 speaker5  It's a young woman, young 20s. She currently looks a little flushed, as if she might have been, I don't know, working out or something. But since Saturday night, you might assume that she might be a little tipsy. Hey!
2572.56 2584.56 speaker3  Honey, how are you? He tilts it down and you can just see his chin.
2583.56 2658.56 speaker5  Is this better? No, please. You remember, like you can put it a little bit further away from your face. That works better. Alright, and she puts down the phone and it's just voiceover. I wondered if you... Have you been doing anything fun lately? Like, except working?
2652.56 2706.56 speaker3  I get out, sweetie. Just today I saw some corn wrestling while I was out on assignment. They also had crabs. Not the men. The farm. They raised corn and crabs.
2705.56 2733.56 speaker5  Yeah, I don't know.
2729.56 2743.56 speaker3  Which is your ultimate dream and desire, of course, right?
2740.56 2777.56 speaker5  I've decided that I'm not going to do that anymore. I've decided that I am going to pursue something else, something that I am passionate about. And it's not journalism, it's not writing, it's not any of that. I have decided I'm going to become a nature photographer.
2772.56 2824.56 speaker3  Sweetheart, I just want you to know that no matter what you choose, That's what it's all about.
2817.56 2835.56 speaker5  But it's like for, like, beautiful women posing without clothing. No, it's not pornography. Carolina?
2834.56 2842.56 speaker3  Oh, I'm sorry. Nerd pornography.
2841.56 2867.56 speaker5  You never understand. You mock everything I do. That's the problem with you and mom. You're both academics and I don't want to be involved with this. Like, I don't want to go to school anymore. I'm going to buy my camera. I'm going to take pictures of my friends and they will pay me eventually. And then I'll start an Instagram account and I'm going to make a lot of money. And there's nothing you can say or do. And, yeah.
2866.56 2877.56 speaker2  Hold on. This is specifically because of what you've seen tonight and the amount of grip that you lost.
2874.56 2887.56 speaker3  Yeah, I know, but what I was just about to say was all about that. Oh, okay.
2885.56 2897.56 speaker2  Yeah, he hates the dice. But he succeeds. Okay, yeah.
2891.56 2932.56 speaker3  So you see from the part of your father's chin that you can't see. It, like, quivers a little bit. But then he composes itself and he says, Honey, your mother and I will support you no matter what you choose to do. We only want you to be happy. If you can make beautiful art and put it into this world, that is enough for me.
2930.56 2937.56 speaker5  Well, I'm not going to graduate. That's the thing.
2933.56 2948.56 speaker3  Until you burlesque photography.
2946.56 2955.56 speaker5  You said you've seen some horrible stuff.
2953.56 2981.56 speaker3  It bent the wrong way. Everything will be fine in the world. And you will, no matter what you choose to do, you will be an important contributing part of it.
2979.56 3007.56 speaker5  And she's starting to get worried. Like, wow, he really needs to start getting out there. but I think it would be good for you to, like, there are apps you can download that would, like, match you with other women. I just don't want you to be, like, be alone.
3004.56 3024.56 speaker3  I have you. I have my memories.
3023.56 3057.56 speaker5  Bumble? I mean, like, when you've downloaded them, let me know and I'll give you some advice because you can't be, like, don't start commenting on women's profiles like a weirdo. you put up a nice picture of yourself and then you write something nice about you, like you're an established journalist, and then you wait for women to contact you.
3056.56 3069.56 speaker1  No.
3067.56 3091.56 speaker5  Well, maybe. I don't know, man. So, Dad, you can't follow my friends. Like, they are not part of the dating pool. Is that why you're asking? No, no.
3089.56 3095.56 speaker3  Have you heard of TikTok?
3094.56 3099.56 speaker5  Oh, I'm sorry.
3098.56 3115.56 speaker3  No, no. It's posted on the Cannes TikTok for the station. People liked it.
3112.56 3117.56 speaker2  you see it's called the Calzone.
3116.56 3122.56 speaker5  Oh, God.
3120.56 3136.56 speaker2  who's doing a very cool dance where it looks like he's sitting while he's upright and dancing around in a sitting position.
3133.56 3183.56 speaker5  You should, actually, you should keep doing that. In a weird, twisted reality that we currently live in, you would actually find more dates based on this video. Women like my mom, sure. But you should not narrow your, like, there are plenty of women out there that aren't like mom. I have to go, but thank you for being supportive of my choices. Try to get some sleep and then maybe we'll, yeah, I'll check in with you tomorrow. But I still, until I have some money, maybe don't cancel my credit card yet.
3181.56 3195.56 speaker3  But again, don't tell your mother she would cancel them in a heartbeat.
3193.56 3201.56 speaker5  And I, yeah, thank you.
3198.56 3212.56 speaker3  This has been Cal Colorado. Have a pleasant evening.
3211.56 3221.56 speaker2  Oh, my God. That was great. I'm very much looking forward to seeing how this relationship thrives or...
3219.56 3232.56 speaker5  Yeah, it was very, like, I love how, like, I expected Zach to come in and be like, and then all of a sudden her head falls off and I'm like, she dies. And I'm like, okay, cool.
3230.56 3235.56 speaker2  We got time to fuck this shit up.
3234.56 3240.56 speaker3  where your head falls off.
3239.56 3241.56 speaker5  Yeah.
3240.56 3249.56 speaker2  Yeah, very nice. It's all I can do. I'm too stupid. It's a shame. And it's all my fault.
