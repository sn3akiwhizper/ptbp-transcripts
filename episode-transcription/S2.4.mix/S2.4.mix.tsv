0	6120	It's your moon howling and scowling.
6120	10400	Pepperoni with the side of extra cheese wulf the dog.
10400	14660	The moistest DJ this side of the solar highway.
14660	22480	And I am a-woo-ing at you live from 694.2 PTBP, the greatest radio station that ever
22480	23480	did.
23480	27280	Now lets move on to the greatest things y'all ever did.
27280	28960	Write me fan mail.
28960	35140	This week's howlin with wulf is from at black goat underscore m10 who instagrammed about
35140	38160	the show and tagged at pretending pod.
38160	41800	What a super cool way to let your friends know you're a freak.
41800	44880	He writes greetings Mr. Wolf.
44880	48480	Pretty new listener and first time howler here.
48480	49480	Great show.
49480	56160	I've not really been into RPGs before but I really enjoy the gangs escapades and contention
56160	57160	and the city.
57360	59040	Keep up the good work.
59040	61800	Big shout out to Victor for sending me your way.
61800	66280	Appreciative howls from Mattias in Sweden.
66280	71480	Mattias are you telling me that THE Victor sent you?
71480	73200	What did he tell you?
73200	75360	Who do you work for?
75360	80700	Mattias you're on thin ice buddy and you better watch your back.
80700	86280	And you tell Victor tell him that wulf says hello.
86400	91800	If you want to write up something for your wulf to howl tag at pretending pod on twitter.
91800	98540	Tag at pretending pod on instagram like Mattias or tag at pretending to be people on facebook.
98540	104960	Wolf and his producer haven't spent a single dime on advertising so y'all all here because
104960	110420	of words in mouths or words in posts or words in comments sections.
110420	113040	The point is words are powerful.
113040	119880	Please use yours to share this show with your friends, your co-workers, your grandparents
119880	121640	and step cousins.
121640	124920	And as a reward for your sharing I'll do two things.
124920	131540	One, I might choose you to submit a howling with wulf and two I might and definitely always
131540	134380	do put the links in the show notes.
134380	142520	And while you're posting on them socials about 694.2 PTBP keep them ear holes open and receiving
142520	144480	my dulcet tones.
144480	147360	It's time for the news.
147360	153120	Last time the field team at City Action News showed the good people of TikTok a glimpse
153120	159660	into the calzone on their way to a potential story from a woman named Kaylee Silver.
159660	163680	What they found was the scene of a gruesome homicide.
163680	168760	After watching footage from the Furbo it's clear that Kaylee Silver walked over to her
168760	174600	fridge, cracked a beer and her friend Kaylee Gold's head unnaturally snapped toward the
174600	180820	kitchen before this differently dispositioned Kaylee Gold lunged at the apartments resident
180820	182200	Kaylee Silver.
182200	188320	The attack took place out of view behind the kitchen counter but it seems Kaylee Silver
188320	193760	stabbed her friend repeatedly in the neck with her broken beer bottle until Kaylee Gold's
193760	196320	head was all but decapitated.
196320	202160	Thankfully for this story the Cannes crew called the city cops, made statements and
202160	206320	headed off to cleanse their palates with a drink at the foundry.
206320	212280	Taking us there now is a bop that don't stop, good shit that don't quit, an anthem for the
212280	213520	handsome.
213520	218560	It's Altagirl with My Life is Great and It's All My Phone.
226320	255360	And it's all mine, cause my life is great and it's all my phone.
255360	258000	So why would we do a season one name?
258000	260940	Everyone from season one is dead to this podcast, Luke.
260940	262960	We are moving on, this is season two.
262960	266880	Dude, Thomas, ask me anything about season one.
266880	267880	What's season one?
267880	271400	I don't remember.
271400	274080	Welcome back to season two of Pretending to be People.
274080	279600	If you got into this podcast because of season one, thank you, but honestly, that shit is
279600	281560	over and done.
281560	290280	And this is a new era of excellence and groundbreaking podcast roleplay, so fucking get your two
290280	293480	tight britches on, which is a reference to nothing.
293480	297920	If you listen to season one...
297920	298920	Stop listening right now.
298920	299920	Stop.
299920	300920	Yeah, you need to stop.
300920	301920	Cut that out.
301920	304760	Nope, nope, nope, nope, keep going.
304760	308660	The britches this, oh, I feel like I'm, am I clipping for you guys?
308660	309660	A little bit.
309660	310660	I feel very loud.
310660	311660	I'll turn you down.
311660	312700	Turn me down a little bit.
312700	313900	I'll just talk louder.
313900	315780	Oh, the cats, the cats going in the pod box.
315780	317020	Cat in the pod box.
317020	318020	I will say main difference...
318020	320480	She might knock the pod box off the couch.
320480	325620	After listening to the edited version of the first episode of this season.
325620	329020	Yeah, like edited, once it was edited, we were funny and good.
329020	330020	Exactly.
330020	331020	That was the big difference I noticed.
331020	333820	But after listening to that, huge differences.
333820	336560	The britches are going to be small this year.
336560	337560	This years.
337560	338560	This years.
339560	341560	Oh right, they were big in that thing that doesn't exist.
341560	343560	They were big last time and now they're small.
343560	346560	Hey Zach, are they coming out of the f***ing world right now?
346560	347560	No.
347560	348560	Oh, okay.
348560	349560	Nevermind.
349560	352560	Which is a reference to nothing.
352560	353560	Zach is currently...
353560	354560	That cat is going to leave.
354560	356560	Zach is, yeah, aggressively kissing our cat.
356560	359560	Aggressively kissing the top of Niko Case's head.
359560	361560	And the first two times she was like, yeah, sure.
361560	364560	And then the fifth time she was like, I'm not going to sit on this f***ing couch with
364560	365560	you anymore.
365560	367560	You lost cat privilege.
367560	372560	So obviously I know the answer to this, but Joe, where exactly did we leave off last time?
372560	375560	Oh dude, you should have seen the crazy s*** that I saw.
375560	380560	A girl killed another girl in an apartment and it was messed up.
380560	382560	And we were all kind of exasperated by it.
382560	387560	And so Cal Colorado asked us to go to the foundry to maybe wind down.
387560	393560	Which is not a reference to the old Joplin, Missouri music venue.
393560	395560	It's a reference to what, Zach?
395560	397560	Oh, it's a reference to what, Thomas?
397560	400560	I don't remember exactly, but isn't it a newsman's bar?
400560	403560	I believe it's a bar specifically for newsman's.
403560	404560	That's right.
404560	406560	I remember the whole thing.
406560	408560	I knew the whole time I knew that.
408560	410560	So, vroom vroom?
410560	411560	Vroom vroom.
411560	412560	Vroom vroom.
414560	420560	Julius Summers pulls into the parking lot of the foundry.
420560	422560	Yeah, where's the foundry located, Thomas?
422560	424560	What kind of bar is this?
424560	432560	It's got dive bar aesthetics, but much like Cal Colorado's house, there are pictures all over the walls of local news people.
432560	438560	And it's kind of maybe equidistant downtown from the three different local news stations.
438560	444560	And so they all come and relax and unwind there and talk shop afterwards.
444560	447560	Are there any TVs on the walls at all?
447560	453560	Are they showing the news at this place or is it specifically to unwind away from that?
453560	457560	I think they are. I think they never play sports, just the news.
457560	459560	How many news channels are in the city?
459560	461560	He just said there are three.
461560	463560	Okay, there's three TVs then.
463560	470560	I think the foundry is in an older building downtown, but just absolutely always in the shadow of these skyscrapers.
470560	476560	We're in the downtown railroad intersect.
476560	481560	I love it. It's right where the train rolls by and there's a...
481560	483560	They do train shots.
483560	485560	Yeah, of course they do train shots.
485560	494560	So pretty much every time this foundry is rumbling with the train that is basically right outside its back door.
494560	501560	There's just a shitload of attractive people in good suits getting fucking hammered.
501560	503560	And the trains come by a lot.
503560	509560	That's one of the reasons that they chose this place because it's very hard to overhear the conversation like anybody else is having.
509560	513560	You have to lean in close. It's a great place to protect your sources.
513560	521560	In your mind, is this place filled with producers and talent or is my ilk of the camera man and crew there?
521560	525560	Everyone comes to the foundry. We're all friends at the foundry.
525560	528560	Cullerton, KY3, any of the other ones?
529560	539560	I don't think we're referencing specific networks, but it would definitely be the local ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, local anchor people all hanging out there.
539560	545560	Except it's CAN, NNN, Nightly News Now.
545560	547560	ETC is there.
547560	549560	ETC, which is...
549560	551560	Ethical...
551560	553560	This is going to be like PBS and nobody watches it.
553560	554560	Ethical...
554560	555560	Television.
555560	557560	Television channel.
559560	561560	Joe, did you do one?
563560	565560	Yeah, now that we said them all.
565560	567560	RBQ. You guys have fun.
567560	570560	It's sponsored by Arby's and it's barbecue.
570560	573560	Barbecue. Yeah, Royal Broadcasting.
573560	575560	Quarterly.
575560	577560	They only air.
579560	581560	Anyway...
582560	585560	I speedily pull into...
585560	587560	Who packed the ostrich?
587560	590560	I screech into the parking lot of the foundry.
590560	592560	Does Beck say that?
592560	594560	Unless Julius goes...
597560	602560	Julius pulls in, as any normal person would, into a parking spot.
602560	604560	But as he's doing it, he goes...
604560	609560	And then he kind of looks around at the other two and sees Cal is not laughing.
609560	612560	No, Cal is holding onto the oh shit handle.
612560	615560	And is clutching at his chest.
615560	622560	Keep in mind throughout these interactions of the sights you just saw at the apartment.
622560	624560	The high rise that you were just at.
624560	627560	Yeah, I bet you we land in silence.
627560	629560	I bet you we pull in a little somber.
629560	631560	I was going to mention, I don't think...
631560	633560	He would not bring his camera in here.
633560	636560	I think that this is a sacred place that he knows not to film.
636560	637560	Nice.
637560	639560	And that's a very out of character for him.
639560	640560	So you guys walk across...
640560	643560	This is like where the witches and the witch hunters meet.
644560	648560	There are as many people outside smoking as there are inside.
648560	650560	Also smoking?
650560	651560	Yes.
651560	654560	This is a smoking bar, but it's a nice day.
657560	661560	It's a cool evening from an oppressively hot, hot day.
661560	664560	The humidity kind of dies off into the night.
664560	669560	And you've got kind of a cool summer evening as you guys walk across this gravel parking lot.
669560	675560	And head around back to the entrance of the foundry on the train track side.
675560	678560	A train is currently finishing up.
678560	682560	It's bustling through this back area.
682560	689560	And you see a server is haphazardly making their way through the smokers outside with train shots.
689560	691560	He's yelling, train shots!
691560	693560	Who had the train shots?
693560	695560	We got a whole mess of them here.
695560	700560	Cal just like silently takes one off the tray and downs it and puts it back on the tray.
700560	706560	Julius grabs one, takes it, and then puts two dollars down on the tray.
706560	707560	Nice.
707560	711560	Which train shots are specifically a special here at the foundry.
711560	715560	It is a single dollar for a shot of whiskey.
715560	716560	Whisky.
716560	717560	Whisky.
717560	721560	When the train toots its horn as it drives by.
721560	723560	Scoot! Scoot!
723560	724560	Oh god.
724560	728560	If it's fucking dollar whiskey, we're talking Old Crow or worse.
728560	729560	Oh, it's Old Grandad.
729560	730560	Brown Derby Select.
730560	731560	It's Old Grandad.
731560	732560	It's Old Grandad.
732560	733560	Oh yeah.
733560	737560	Orange bottle label.
737560	745560	And you set this down and the server looks at Cal Colorado with a certain appreciation as he carries on with his job.
745560	747560	I think he knows to just add it to Cal's tab.
747560	748560	Nice.
748560	758560	Julius did put the two dollars down on his tray even though he knew that those were not poured out for Cal and Julius.
758560	764560	Immediately you hear him as he walks over to a group who's calling him over with the train shots.
764560	768560	He's reassuring them like, yeah, yeah, no, I'll be right back, I'll be right back.
768560	777560	And their understanding after seeing the looks on the pained faces of Cal Colorado, Julius Summers, and Beck Wilder.
777560	779560	Probably like we recognize.
779560	781560	Are they just like local news crew?
781560	783560	Yeah, it's just another local news crew.
783560	791560	They hold up their shots to you as they all wait on the other two shots to come which come quickly and you're all able to.
791560	795560	Beck takes his head off and does an exaggerated bow and puts it back on.
795560	799560	Guys, this is my first time in here.
799560	801560	I'm very excited.
801560	803560	I've heard a lot about it.
803560	806560	This is the first thing that maybe like brightened Cal's face in a while.
806560	810560	Like he gives a very knowing look to Beck.
810560	812560	Well, we have a first timer here.
812560	814560	I think you know what that means, Beck.
814560	818560	We exchange a look and you see a big smile on Beck looking at you.
818560	823560	Are you thinking like we're going to do the full set up like now?
823560	829560	Maggie doesn't let any first timers in without putting them through the printing press.
829560	833560	Oh, Julius, my man.
833560	835560	You're going to have fun tonight, dude.
835560	836560	It's going to be good for you.
836560	838560	You're going to want to shake off what we saw earlier.
838560	842560	You're going to forget all about that weird horrible homebrew murder.
842560	848560	I mean, I don't know that I'll forget about that anytime soon, but...
848560	854560	No, the images will haunt you for the rest of your life.
854560	857560	But we can obliterate them temporarily.
857560	858560	The printing press?
858560	859560	You'll see.
859560	864560	Julius starts walking faster and wants to be the first one in there
864560	870560	because he's stoked to see what the hell the printing press is.
870560	873560	Do you think that you and I have a booth that we haunt?
873560	874560	Probably, yeah.
874560	875560	I think that'd be cool.
875560	881560	Julius has done his research asking his uncle all about these guys,
881560	883560	so he knows which booth it is.
883560	887560	What?
887560	891560	So Julius goes and sits down in the booth that you guys usually go sit down in.
891560	894560	Do you go sneak in right before Beck gets there?
894560	896560	No, I'm just leading the way.
896560	899560	I'm just going and sitting down and turning around like,
899560	901560	look what I know.
901560	902560	Hey, that's the one we always sit at.
902560	905560	That's weird, dude. Cool.
905560	909560	Hanging Wes Anderson-style directly center frame of the booth
909560	917560	is an old picture of Cal from the night after his first television broadcast
917560	919560	as a head news anchor.
919560	924560	And it's beautifully framed in this old oak wooden frame
924560	926560	and is sitting gloriously.
926560	927560	He looks like a kid.
927560	929560	The suit's wearing him.
929560	932560	Yeah, Cal sits purposely with us back to that.
932560	933560	In what way?
933560	936560	When people look at it, do they see your face next to your face?
936560	942560	No, what they're going to see is a much younger, more handsome man
942560	947560	with a huge smile on his face next to that aged 30 years
947560	950560	and looking absolutely miserable tonight.
950560	952560	It does have that effect that those are contrasted,
952560	955560	but he's not trying to do it as a power move or anything.
955560	957560	He just doesn't want to catch sight of it.
957560	958560	Sure, sure, sure.
958560	963560	As Julius slides into the booth, he's not saying anything
963560	965560	but wiggling with excitement.
965560	967560	He's wanted to do this for so long.
967560	971560	Just be a producer and be part of the news and be able to get into this place.
971560	973560	He is so fucking stoked.
973560	975560	Julius, if you wiggle like that during the printing press,
975560	977560	you could lose a finger.
980560	981560	Printing press.
981560	983560	I want to find out what it is.
983560	985560	Your research didn't tell you what it is.
985560	988560	My uncle would not tell me.
988560	989560	That makes sense.
989560	991560	It's kind of a closely guarded secret around here.
991560	993560	I don't think that anybody goes out there
993560	995560	just telling other people about it, you know?
995560	998560	They never do, if they want to live.
998560	1000560	Only kidding.
1000560	1003560	It's a process that happens in three steps.
1003560	1008560	The first step, you are laid across the bar
1008560	1011560	and your belly is exposed.
1011560	1015560	Julius pulls his shirt up as he lays on the table
1015560	1017560	and then realizes what was said,
1017560	1019560	and then he goes and sits back down again.
1019560	1021560	Tell them the second part.
1021560	1025560	Well, this is kind of like your last moment of choice here,
1025560	1027560	but you get to decide what liquor you want.
1027560	1030560	Once you're laying on the bar with your shirt up?
1030560	1031560	Uh-huh.
1031560	1034560	So what would be your choice if you said your favorite liquor?
1034560	1035560	Tequila.
1035560	1038560	Ooh, that's a bad choice.
1038560	1040560	Right on.
1041560	1045560	The third step is more tequila than you've ever had in your life
1045560	1051560	with hungry news crews eagerly licking it off your midriff.
1051560	1053560	Oh, God.
1054560	1059560	As Maggie, the hardened barkeep, pours a bottle into your mouth.
1059560	1061560	Great name, by the way.
1062560	1066560	So the tequila gets poured into my mouth and...
1066560	1067560	And your belly button.
1067560	1069560	On my belly button.
1069560	1073560	And they let the older interns just absolutely go at you.
1073560	1075560	The older interns!
1080560	1083560	So at this point you're probably asking what's in it for you.
1085560	1087560	The deep respect that comes.
1087560	1095560	I spent a lot of my time in college practicing for this day.
1095560	1097560	Oh, you've had a lot of people lick you.
1097560	1099560	I wish.
1099560	1100560	Oh.
1100560	1102560	Has anyone licked you?
1102560	1106560	Julius gets up from the booth and walks over to the bar with his...
1106560	1110560	While he's like untucking his shirt from his pants.
1110560	1114560	His all-tan suit.
1116560	1118560	I thought you were going to describe your body and I was like,
1118560	1120560	he strikes me as a very pale man.
1120560	1122560	He's pretty pale, yeah.
1122560	1126560	You see a trunk of a woman in a denim vest with long...
1126560	1128560	A vest of a woman in a denim trunk.
1128560	1132560	And in a long braid down the back of her hair.
1132560	1136560	She clinks a bell above her head.
1136560	1138560	And she's like...
1140560	1142560	Hot off the press.
1144560	1146560	Hot off the presses.
1146560	1148560	Oh, that's right.
1148560	1153560	We got a newbie over at City Action News.
1153560	1155560	Come on down.
1156560	1163560	Everyone, give it up for Julius Summers.
1163560	1165560	He's in for the printing press.
1165560	1167560	Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang.
1167560	1169560	And the entire crowd...
1169560	1172560	In circles. All the smokers come inside when they hear the bell.
1172560	1174560	And immediately jackets come off.
1174560	1177560	Ties are loosened. Top buttons are undone.
1177560	1179560	And these very dorky...
1179560	1182560	You see the interns start circling.
1182560	1184560	And they all look like Jonah from Veep.
1184560	1186560	And Julius...
1188560	1192560	Julius is laying on the bar with his shirt kind of pulled up.
1192560	1194560	Exposing his stomach.
1194560	1200560	And then one of the Jonah interns just rips all of his upper clothing off.
1200560	1208560	printing press!
1208560	1211560	And the chants fade away.
1211560	1214560	Much like Julius's memories.
1214560	1217560	From the entire night.
1217560	1223560	Beck and Cow, however, don't get printing pressed by a bunch of rabid interns.
1223560	1228560	And therefore are able to keep their wits in their brain helmets for the evening.
1228560	1230560	Let's go check that out.
1230560	1234560	Hey, thanks so much for listening to Pretending to Be People.
1234560	1236560	Probably means you're fucking cool.
1236560	1245560	We've got a very special guest on today's episode of Pretending to Be People.
1245560	1250560	I had an idea in my head when we were discussing the recording of Season 2.
1250560	1256560	Joe and I had talked about who his character would interact with the most.
1256560	1259560	And your answer to that was...
1259560	1261560	Mother.
1261560	1263560	The answer was mother.
1263560	1269560	I think you specifically told me I can't have dead parents this time.
1269560	1271560	Well, not yet.
1271560	1274560	Not yet, exactly.
1274560	1284560	And when you said mom, immediately I thought, well, let's get our podcast dad to come on and play Beck Wilder's mom.
1284560	1288560	It's Scott Norwood is back, baby!
1288560	1290560	Thank you very much for having me back on.
1290560	1295560	This isn't the first time I've been called a mother, but at least the circumstances are different.
1295560	1299560	Well, we really appreciate you coming on.
1299560	1305560	For those of you who are just hearing Scott on Pretending to Be People for the first time for some fucking reason.
1305560	1311560	Scott is my parasocial RPG mentor.
1311560	1313560	He didn't know that he was my mentor.
1314560	1322560	But listening to his podcast that he does with Matt Sanderson and Paul Fricker, good friends of Jackson Elias,
1322560	1328560	truly developed me into the GM that I am today.
1328560	1334560	And I am super appreciative of all the lessons I've learned listening to their podcast over the years.
1334560	1339560	Oh, blimey. I'm still amazed that anyone even listens to it, let alone learns.
1340560	1345560	Scott, before I was ever aware of who you were, I knew that Zach listened to your podcast,
1345560	1350560	and you answered some questions for him one time, and he was so excited and told us all about it.
1350560	1355560	And that was way before there was ever a glimmer of hope of meeting you, let alone playing with you.
1355560	1360560	Oh, yeah. We weren't even talking about recording a podcast, but I was running Hell in Texas,
1360560	1367560	which is a scenario that you wrote for the book The Things We Leave Behind by Stigine Fox Publishing.
1367560	1373560	And that's a great book, and your scenario in it is so terrifying and awesome.
1374560	1379560	So I posted some questions on the subreddit, and you yourself came in and answered them,
1379560	1382560	and I lost my fucking shit, Scott.
1387560	1394560	I waste half my life on Reddit. It is my main time sink, and I am not proud of that.
1395560	1402560	Well, that time sink made this nerd super happy and validated many, many years ago, so thank you for that.
1402560	1408560	Some might say this podcast wouldn't exist without you, Scott. You gave him the hope, the drive.
1408560	1410560	Oh, it's all my fault now, is it?
1412560	1414560	We have to pin it on somebody.
1415560	1429560	I would like to take us to the home of Beck and Kim Wilder as Ramona scoots her cat.
1432560	1436560	Zach has a cat food bowl that is one of those ones that's like a maze.
1436560	1438560	Yeah, it keeps Ramona nice and...
1438560	1439560	But it kind of becomes a game.
1439560	1441560	Smart, yeah.
1442560	1448560	Yeah, she grabs each piece individually and then eats it out of her own paw, which is rad.
1449560	1451560	But noisy, I imagine.
1451560	1454560	Quite noisy. I'm going to move it into the back room.
1457560	1463560	I barely get through a recording session without one of my cats running into the room and screaming like a seagull,
1463560	1466560	or jumping all over things and knocking shit over.
1467560	1468560	Yep.
1468560	1472560	My cats are named Chaos and Anarchy and it's with good reason.
1472560	1473560	That's great.
1475560	1480560	Beck Wilder has had a brutal day.
1480560	1482560	Started off fine.
1482560	1487560	Woke up around 2 p.m. in your tighty-whities, in your messy bedroom.
1489560	1492560	Headed off, shot a segment out on a farm.
1492560	1495560	He had a rough evening? Was it evening?
1495560	1502560	Yeah, it was a rough evening. You were called out for a potential story that was...
1502560	1505560	We weren't even 100% sure what we were going out there for.
1505560	1507560	And what did you find?
1507560	1509560	Oh man, it wasn't good.
1509560	1515560	It was a terrible, terrible crime scene, including a partially severed head.
1515560	1516560	Yeah.
1516560	1520560	That wasn't what Beck was thinking was going to happen that day.
1520560	1525560	Yeah, I mean, a severed head is bad enough. A partially severed head sounds worse.
1527560	1529560	Yeah, it's a lot worse.
1531560	1533560	Just holding on.
1533560	1534560	Just a little hinge.
1536560	1538560	Beck isn't in the greatest headspace.
1538560	1543560	He's now just gotten back from the foundry where he had a nice night trying to drink his troubles away.
1543560	1547560	Are you feeling a little loose? You feeling a little warm in the face?
1547560	1549560	Beck always feels loose.
1549560	1556560	He's maybe a little bit looser than normal, but he kind of lives in an equilibrium of inebriation.
1557560	1559560	A loose state. I like that.
1559560	1570560	So as you arrive home, it's late at night. It's 1130 PM, maybe even midnight, which is about as late in the night as you can get.
1571560	1573560	Before it starts becoming morning.
1573560	1574560	That's right.
1575560	1591560	Kim Wilder has the home to herself. Her son is a mid 30s field cameraman for City Action News, and he is still living in your house, Kim.
1593560	1594560	For now.
1596560	1600560	What is Kim Wilder up to on a random Saturday evening?
1600560	1607560	I think she's sitting there on the sofa, knitting and watching television.
1607560	1613560	The sound is way down on the TV and there's just the clack, clack, clack of knitting needles.
1613560	1618560	And somehow she is managing to make knitting look angry.
1620560	1629560	Out of the corner of her eyes, she just keeps darting her eyes over and stabbing them into the corner where Beck keeps his camera equipment,
1629560	1640560	which is not there at the time, but there's like a whole corner of this room that is specifically set up to house Beck's livelihood.
1640560	1646560	Oh, yeah. You can tell exactly where it is just by all the scuff marks and the skirting board and the floor tiles.
1649560	1656560	And the last you saw Beck, it was maybe even yesterday, because today you knew that he was in his bedroom.
1656560	1664560	You knew that he, you know, had been sleeping in, but you went to knock on his door for tea or snack or he wasn't even in there.
1664560	1672560	He just left the house without saying anything. And as those thoughts are flowing through your brain, the front door swings open.
1672560	1679560	Hey Ma, you're up. Oh, this is awkward.
1679560	1692560	Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. I thought that was a burglar coming in, but no, it's just my son staying out all hours again.
1692560	1695560	And where have you been tonight, young man?
1695560	1702560	Get some drinks with the boys. You know, it's... I had a bad night, Mama.
1702560	1708560	Yes, I can smell just how bad your night was from here. Yes.
1710560	1715560	You're not going to bed until you put something in your stomach to soak up some of that beer.
1715560	1723560	There's still some hot dog casserole in the oven. It's probably, oh, it's probably burnt to a crisp by now.
1723560	1728560	But, well, give it a try. Cut up the wieners nice and small, just the way you like it.
1728560	1732560	Just the way I like it. Cut up more hot dogs.
1733560	1740560	Beck starts walking toward the fridge and you can tell now that he's a little drunker even than you've ever seen him.
1740560	1746560	He's a stumble-ier than you've ever seen him. And he kind of catches himself, woo, a little woozy.
1746560	1757560	Sorry. Sorry about that, Ma. I know we don't like to talk about like what I do, but like I saw some shit tonight, Mom. It was bad.
1757560	1761560	And what exactly did you see?
1761560	1770560	Oh, it's kind of like a thing that's like under investigation now. I don't know if like I might need a lawyer to talk to you about it.
1770560	1777560	Honestly, I really don't understand why you can't have a proper job. You're out all hours.
1777560	1786560	I never know whether I'm going to find you sleeping in your room in the middle of the afternoon or whether you're going to stay out until three o'clock in the morning.
1786560	1791560	Clearly, what you're doing isn't making you enough money for you to actually move into your own place.
1791560	1796560	And now you're saying that it's dangerous as well and it's going to get you into trouble.
1796560	1801560	Why do you do this? Why can't you just get a proper job?
1801560	1813560	You know, Macey Grindel's son, Deke, he's got he's got a nice thriving business for himself selling secondhand sofa beds and he's moved into a new apartment downtown.
1813560	1820560	It's all his own. Well, I think he's got a couple of flatmates, but he's not living with his mother anymore. That's the important thing.
1820560	1828560	Yeah, but Deke's a fucking asshole. Oh, not this again. Jesus Christ.
1828560	1833560	He's a financially solvent asshole.
1833560	1837560	Sorry, the internet connection cut out a little bit right there.
1837560	1847560	He's a financially solvent asshole.
1847560	1850560	Brilliant.
1850560	1861560	As Kim started to go into that diatribe, Beck had his back to her and he was kind of mouthing along with these words. He's heard it so many times.
1861560	1868560	Oh, she's got to mention Deke again. She's got to mention Deke. Oh, there we go.
1868560	1874560	If you love Deke so much, why didn't you give birth to him?
1874560	1882560	Don't think that I haven't thought about that every day. Ew, gross, mom. You think about fucking Deke's dad?
1882560	1886560	A wistful look crosses Kim's eyes.
1886560	1891560	Oh my God.
1891560	1900560	For like half a second, I thought we were going to get something really meaningful when Kim was like, why do you even do this job?
1900560	1908560	And then Beck's like, go fuck my friend's dad.
1908560	1920560	At this point, Beck has lost the gusto for the hot dog casserole and is just kind of like slopping it onto a plate and throwing it in the microwave and is trying his best to like avoid eye contact with you.
1920560	1927560	Look, Ma, I know that it's like not like the best paying thing in the world, but it's like what I want to do.
1927560	1934560	Like, I don't know if you can understand like happiness from that perspective, but that's what I've got for me right now.
1934560	1949560	Look, you've got to understand that part of being a grown up is that we all have to do things that we don't want to do, because that's just how we get through life.
1949560	1957560	And yes, all right, you can run around doing your camera stuff and whatever it is you do at three o'clock in the morning.
1957560	1964560	And I try not to judge you, but sooner or later, you've got to grow up.
1964560	1970560	You can't just carry on like this and pretend that everything's all right.
1970560	1975560	You've got to you've got to grow up someday, boy.
1975560	1982560	Beck is now kind of a little more solemn and a little more introspective visually.
1982560	1987560	And he pulls the food out of the microwave and he's holding the plate and he's kind of picking at it with a fork.
1987560	1993560	Yeah, I mean, fine. We disagree on like fundamental things, Ma.
1993560	2003560	I just maybe someday you'll see that I can I can do this and also like be successful, whatever that means to you.
2003560	2005560	I'm going to my room.
2005560	2008560	All right. You'll have to pick up the clean sheets.
2008560	2011560	I've left them out for you, but you'll have to make the bed yourself.
2011560	2022560	And I tried to get the stains out, but we're going to have to try a new brand.
2022560	2028560	Yeah, OK, thanks. Thanks, Mommy. You got any milk?
2028560	2033560	Sounds a bit flogging.
2033560	2046560	Scott, we didn't bring you on here to roleplay anything other than what's about to happen.
2046560	2055560	Scott, thank you so much. I think I think that's perfect.
2055560	2058560	Scott, as always, an absolute pleasure.
2058560	2065560	Oh, thank you. Zach, we live in a weird, privileged world that we just had Scott Dorward on to play with my mom.
2065560	2071560	And I said, thanks, Mommy. Got any milk?
2071560	2073560	And then we said, have a good day.
2073560	2079560	That is good to hold me.
2079560	2082560	All right, Scott, thank you so much. Seriously, thank you so much.
2082560	2089560	And for those of you who enjoyed Scott just now, you can hear him.
2089560	2095560	He runs two different full scenarios for us on pretending to be people in our bonus episodes.
2095560	2096560	Episodes? Episodes?
2096560	2104560	Here on the main feed, Scott, you ran Bleak Prospect, a Call of Cthulhu scenario that you wrote so fucking creepy.
2104560	2106560	It's one of my favorite things that we've done on the show.
2106560	2111560	Starts in a Hoover town and goes to worse places.
2111560	2119560	And you also recently ran a Pulp Cthulhu scenario, both of which, by the way, that Scott wrote.
2119560	2121560	This one was A New Age of Wonders.
2121560	2129560	And that was, for me personally, I think one of my absolute favorite player experiences I've ever had in an RPG.
2129560	2134560	Oh, man. Oh, I'm glad you liked it. I had an absolute blast running it.
2134560	2135560	We did, too.
2135560	2138560	That's so fun.
2138560	2144560	All right, well, I'm going to stop gushing and we'll see you soon, Scott.
2144560	2146560	Oh, marvelous. Look forward to it.
2146560	2148560	Good night, Mommy.
2148560	2151560	Oh, God. I've got to go and have a bath now.
2151560	2163560	We're Team Press! We're Team Press! We're Team Press! We're Team Press! We're Team Press! We're Team Press!
2163560	2167560	If you're just now joining us, welcome back to Pretending to Be People.
2167560	2170560	We are here with a special guest right now.
2170560	2180560	It is the GM of the Lost Mountain Saga, one of the best players from Glass Cannon Networks, and droids, and aliens.
2180560	2186560	It is Eleanor de Lorenzo.
2186560	2191560	Let's get one that the people can hear.
2191560	2197560	It's fun to talk like this, but I don't know if anybody can understand Eleanor de Lorenzo.
2197560	2198560	Hey, Ellie.
2198560	2206560	Hello. I understood. There were compliments in that. I understood that. I sucked that up right up.
2206560	2208560	I picked those out right away.
2208560	2210560	Thank you so much for coming back on.
2210560	2212560	Ellie, thank you so much for coming and joining us again.
2212560	2216560	Oh, dude. I'm so excited to be back. Thank you for inviting me.
2216560	2221560	If you're listening to this and you haven't heard Ellie on Pretending to Be People before,
2221560	2227560	Ellie was a guest and a player when I ran a homebrew scenario that I wrote, Bigfoot Underground Search and Hunt.
2227560	2232560	for her and some other guest players, and we had an absolutely phenomenal time.
2232560	2237560	You were such a wonderful player that I was so excited to bring you back on.
2237560	2242560	But another huge reason that I was so excited to bring you on is when I told Thomas, I was like,
2242560	2247560	Hey, dude, Ellie from A&A is coming on Pretending to Be People.
2247560	2253560	Yeah, and then you had her play with a bunch of people who weren't fans of that show.
2253560	2257560	Which as a fan was like, well, that's a bummer.
2257560	2263560	Couldn't have anyone except me getting too starstruck on her first appearance on Pretending to Be People.
2263560	2266560	Fair enough. You wanted to protect her from...
2266560	2269560	From what's about to happen, yes.
2269560	2273560	From the slobbering idiots of the PTBP pod.
2273560	2278560	I love slobbering idiots, though. That's what I'm more comfortable with, you know what I'm saying?
2278560	2283560	Now I played with very talented, wonderful women and they were all great, but I will say...
2283560	2284560	That sounds deeply intimidating.
2284560	2286560	Intimidating, yeah.
2286560	2290560	They were hot. They stared at me with their hot eyes.
2290560	2293560	And one of them was apparently married to you, Zach.
2293560	2295560	That is correct, yeah, apparently.
2295560	2296560	Apparently.
2296560	2297560	Apparently?
2297560	2299560	Yeah, allegedly married.
2299560	2303560	Allegedly, Taylor and her hot eyes are married to Zach.
2303560	2305560	I'm an allegedly lucky man.
2308560	2315560	Okay. I'm not going to correct that because I'm waiting for all the chinks in your marriage's armor to collapse at once.
2315560	2319560	Coming in hot. Coming in hot. Love it.
2319560	2321560	I'll have to beat Luke off, but...
2321560	2324560	Wow, I'd watch that.
2324560	2326560	So, Thomas, are you married?
2326560	2328560	Uh, no. No, I'm not married.
2328560	2332560	You said that very quickly, no. It was like a gut reaction, no.
2332560	2334560	Well, I remembered that I wasn't.
2334560	2336560	Oh, right. Well...
2336560	2339560	You looked back at your whole life and you thought...
2339560	2342560	Did I leave a wife somewhere?
2342560	2343560	Along the road?
2343560	2346560	It's like when people ask you if you're like, do you have any kids?
2346560	2348560	And you're like, not that I'm aware of.
2348560	2350560	It's like, do you have a wife? Not that I'm aware of.
2350560	2352560	Not that I'm aware of.
2352560	2359560	I'm known for not knowing much about America and I just realized that I know you guys are from a state.
2359560	2363560	But I don't remember which state right this second.
2363560	2365560	Is it Missouri?
2365560	2366560	Yeah.
2366560	2367560	Wow.
2367560	2371560	I was going to make a joke about you have a one in 50 shot, so just go for it.
2371560	2372560	You fucking nailed it.
2372560	2373560	I did.
2373560	2374560	Got it in one.
2374560	2378560	It is indeed Missouri, which we like, but a lot of people don't.
2378560	2380560	Oh, yeah. We love it.
2380560	2383560	It's nice here. It's really hot right now, actually. It sucks here.
2383560	2386560	Oh, but still, I would love to go.
2386560	2392560	But is it nice because it's like, you know, you can be on a horse ranch and...
2392560	2393560	I'm sorry.
2393560	2395560	Yeah, you can be on a horse ranch.
2395560	2396560	Okay.
2396560	2403560	Well, I mean, I don't make very much money and this is my house that we're recording in.
2403560	2411560	Oh, screw you and making fun of my bullshit New York studio cabin.
2411560	2412560	But that's true.
2412560	2414560	That's a really cool thing about Missouri.
2414560	2417560	You have an actual kitchen. I love that.
2417560	2420560	I want a Missouri kitchen.
2420560	2425560	Let's get into Cal, Colorado.
2425560	2427560	Cal, you've had a very interesting night.
2427560	2432560	I want to dive back into some of the things that you've seen here on this random night.
2432560	2433560	I don't.
2433560	2438560	Oh, yeah. That makes sense because one of these memories that keeps just blasting into your head
2438560	2446560	as you're leaving the foundry is just this headless, almost headless neck
2446560	2449560	held on by a couple of tendons and skin on ones.
2450560	2458560	Your mind drifts immediately from this severed neck off to your daughter.
2458560	2462560	A little bit. Mostly my mind is just shouting neck hole, neck hole, neck hole
2462560	2468560	as I see like this horrifying like red flash and this image of this nearly headless neck.
2468560	2471560	Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as you get into your car.
2471560	2476560	Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as you drive really far back to your home.
2476560	2480560	Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole, neck hole everywhere.
2480560	2485560	Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as you sit into your chair.
2485560	2489560	And he turns on a 24-hour news channel like he always does.
2489560	2491560	Natch. Drown it out, baby.
2491560	2495560	Honestly, the cleaning person must have turned it off because he kind of likes to just keep it on all day.
2495560	2501560	But yeah, he turns that on. He goes over to his pretty dusty home bar.
2502560	2508560	He grabs a glass and takes a bottle of cheap white wine out of the refrigerator
2508560	2512560	and pours it to the brim and then downs that and pours another.
2512560	2517560	And at that moment, you feel a vibration coming from your pocket
2517560	2522560	and it's not the vibration of a text or a call. Do you not have a phone that vibrates?
2522560	2528560	No, he does, but we don't do vibrates here. We have a ring on this podcast.
2528560	2529560	That's right.
2529560	2531560	Ring, ring, ring, ring.
2531560	2534560	Yeah, he hears the ringtone set to his daughter, Carol.
2536560	2542560	Eleanor de Lorenzo, what does Carol's face look like on the screen of Cal's phone here?
2542560	2545560	It's a young woman, young 20s.
2545560	2550560	She currently looks a little flushed, as if she might have been, I don't know, working out or something.
2550560	2554560	But since Saturday night, you might assume that she might be a little tipsy.
2554560	2559560	And she's sitting down on a couch that you recognize to be her student room.
2559560	2560560	Hey!
2563560	2571560	Carol, it's lovely to hear from you. I'm sorry, I've had kind of an extraordinary evening.
2572560	2573560	Honey, how are you?
2573560	2578560	Dad, can you tilt your phone up a little bit? I can't see you.
2578560	2580560	Like you're filming your forehead again.
2580560	2582560	He tilts it down and you can just see his chin.
2583560	2584560	Is this better?
2584560	2585560	No, please.
2586560	2591560	You remember, like you can put it a little bit further away from your face. That works better.
2591560	2594560	You just see one giant eye as he's looking into the camera lens.
2594560	2598560	Alright, and she puts down the phone and it's just voiceover.
2603560	2608560	Honey, I'd love to see your darling face, especially with you so far away from home.
2608560	2610560	Please explain FaceTime to me.
2613560	2616560	Oh, Dad, have you been drinking?
2616560	2624560	Just a little wine. It's a Saturday night. I'm a single man. Can I not enjoy a sifter of wine?
2624560	2628560	No, of course. Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you a little bit about.
2628560	2633560	I wondered if you... Have you been doing anything fun lately? Like, except working?
2633560	2637560	Work is fun, sweetie. Your mother and I always tried to tell you that.
2637560	2646560	No, I know. I know. I just... I don't know. I worry about you. That's why... I just wish you, you know, would get out there a little bit.
2646560	2652560	Cal thinks about where he just got out to and pauses and he kind of gulps and he's like,
2652560	2658560	I get out, sweetie. Just today I saw some corn wrestling while I was out on assignment.
2658560	2664560	They also had crabs. Not the men. The farm. They raised corn and crabs.
2664560	2665560	Alright.
2665560	2667560	So I get out.
2667560	2677560	Yeah, no, I get it. I know. I just... I don't know if you... I'm sure you already heard, but Mom, I think... Mom's seeing someone.
2677560	2683560	Yes, I heard. He's quite a bit younger, too. I heard he was 40.
2683560	2689560	Yeah, but, I mean, after you turn 25, it's like age doesn't matter anymore.
2689560	2691560	Oh.
2691560	2700560	She says that with 100% sincerity because she thinks that if you're over 25, you're ancient.
2700560	2705560	And you can tell that suddenly Carol seems a little bit nervous.
2705560	2706560	Yeah, I don't know.
2706560	2708560	Is there something else on your mind, sweetie?
2708560	2712560	Well, promise you won't get angry.
2712560	2713560	I promise.
2713560	2723560	Well, you know that I always wanted to make you happy, and that's why I went to journalism school.
2723560	2729560	Of course. Just like your mother and I, you went on to journalism school to continue the family business.
2729560	2733560	Which is your ultimate dream and desire, of course, right?
2733560	2740560	Right. But, well, I've decided, and she suddenly gets defensive as if she's ready to fight.
2740560	2743560	I've decided that I'm not going to do that anymore.
2743560	2749560	I've decided that I am going to pursue something else, something that I am passionate about.
2749560	2753560	And it's not journalism, it's not writing, it's not any of that.
2753560	2759560	I have decided I'm going to become a nature photographer.
2759560	2764560	Well, sweetie, that's... that's wonderful.
2764560	2765560	Really?
2765560	2769560	You know, photography is still technically journalism.
2769560	2772560	No, no, okay, what...
2772560	2777560	Sweetheart, I just want you to know that no matter what you choose,
2777560	2785560	even if you're not a world-class news anchor like me or a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist like your mother,
2785560	2796560	we're happy that what you have chosen is still inexplicably linked to the nexus of reporting and,
2796560	2799560	well, you know, showing the truth of our world to the people.
2799560	2800560	That's what it's all about.
2800560	2805560	Okay, well, see, see, that was like... I knew that you were going to react like that,
2805560	2809560	so now I'm going to tell you the real... my real job.
2809560	2811560	A bait and switch.
2811560	2815560	I'm going to tell you the real... it's still related to photography.
2815560	2817560	Yeah?
2817560	2824560	But it's like for, like, beautiful women posing without clothing.
2824560	2825560	Pornography?
2825560	2826560	Pornography?
2826560	2827560	No, it's not pornography.
2827560	2828560	Carolina?
2828560	2831560	It's not pornography.
2831560	2834560	It's boudoir photography.
2834560	2835560	Oh, I'm sorry.
2835560	2840560	Nerd pornography.
2840560	2841560	See, this is the thing.
2841560	2842560	You never understand.
2842560	2843560	You mock everything I do.
2843560	2845560	That's the problem with you and mom.
2845560	2848560	You're both academics and I don't want to be involved with this.
2848560	2849560	Like, I don't want to go to school anymore.
2849560	2851560	I'm going to buy my camera.
2851560	2856560	I'm going to take pictures of my friends and they will pay me eventually.
2856560	2859560	And then I'll start an Instagram account and I'm going to make a lot of money.
2859560	2861560	And there's nothing you can say or do.
2861560	2862560	And, yeah.
2862560	2864560	Roll a grip check, Dad.
2864560	2865560	No, I think he's...
2865560	2866560	No, no, no. This is...
2866560	2867560	Hold on.
2867560	2869560	This is specifically because of what you've seen tonight
2869560	2871560	and the amount of grip that you lost.
2871560	2874560	It is going to affect the relationships that you have.
2874560	2877560	Yeah, I know, but what I was just about to say was all about that.
2877560	2878560	Oh, okay.
2878560	2880560	And why it actually wouldn't.
2880560	2885560	Well, that's part of the game is you have to roll to do that.
2885560	2887560	Yeah, he hates the dice.
2887560	2889560	But he succeeds.
2889560	2890560	Okay, yeah.
2890560	2891560	All fair enough.
2891560	2897560	So you see from the part of your father's chin that you can't see.
2897560	2899560	It, like, quivers a little bit.
2899560	2903560	But then he composes itself and he says,
2903560	2908560	Honey, your mother and I will support you no matter what you choose to do.
2908560	2910560	We only want you to be happy.
2910560	2916560	And tonight I saw some horrible things that I can never unsee.
2916560	2921560	If you can make beautiful art and put it into this world,
2921560	2923560	that is enough for me.
2923560	2927560	You're going to want to approach this more carefully with your mother.
2927560	2930560	We may not tell her until you've graduated.
2930560	2932560	Well, I'm not going to graduate. That's the thing.
2932560	2933560	Right, right, right.
2933560	2937560	Until you burlesque photography.
2937560	2943560	Well, this is a whole new world for me, pumpkin.
2943560	2946560	So, Dad, are you all right?
2946560	2948560	You said you've seen some horrible stuff.
2948560	2950560	I didn't see a neck hole.
2950560	2953560	Sorry, one of the wrestlers broke his arm.
2953560	2955560	It bent the wrong way.
2955560	2958560	It was gnarly.
2958560	2962560	I love that Cal picked up the word gnarly from Beck.
2962560	2965560	Oh, no, Jesus. Is he going to be okay?
2965560	2967560	Yes, sweetie, I think he'll be fine.
2967560	2969560	Everything will be fine in the world.
2969560	2972560	And you will, no matter what you choose to do,
2972560	2975560	you will be an important contributing part of it.
2975560	2977560	And your mother and I love you very deeply.
2977560	2979560	Well, I love you too, Dad.
2979560	2981560	And she's starting to get worried.
2981560	2984560	Like, wow, he really needs to start getting out there.
2987560	2989560	I don't know, Dad, I know it's not my business,
2989560	2992560	but I think it would be good for you to, like,
2992560	2995560	there are apps you can download that would, like,
2995560	2998560	match you with other women.
2998560	3001560	I just don't want you to be, like, be alone.
3001560	3004560	I'm not alone, sweetie.
3004560	3007560	I have you. I have my memories.
3007560	3009560	He points to all the pictures around the house.
3009560	3010560	Oh, my God.
3010560	3013560	See, that's the definition of being alone.
3013560	3017560	But I will try to get out there more.
3017560	3020560	What are these women apps you told me about?
3020560	3023560	Well, one of them is called Bumble.
3023560	3024560	Bumble?
3024560	3026560	I mean, like, when you've downloaded them, let me know
3026560	3029560	and I'll give you some advice because you can't be, like,
3029560	3033560	don't start commenting on women's profiles like a weirdo.
3035560	3037560	How do you comment like a normal-o?
3037560	3039560	Well, you just wait for them to, like,
3039560	3041560	you put up a nice picture of yourself
3041560	3043560	and then you write something nice about you,
3043560	3045560	like you're an established journalist,
3045560	3048560	and then you wait for women to contact you.
3048560	3052560	Is there an app that finds me a woman exactly like your mother?
3052560	3054560	Oh, no.
3054560	3055560	Dad.
3055560	3056560	What?
3056560	3057560	No.
3060560	3063560	Maybe you should go for the complete opposite.
3063560	3064560	Like a guy?
3067560	3069560	Well, maybe.
3069560	3070560	I don't know, man.
3071560	3076560	Carol, I promise you, I will look into online dating.
3076560	3078560	Carol, exciting news.
3078560	3081560	Do you post your boudoir pictures on TikTok?
3081560	3082560	Well, okay.
3082560	3084560	So, Dad, you can't follow my friends.
3084560	3086560	Like, they are not part of the dating pool.
3086560	3087560	Is that why you're asking?
3087560	3088560	No, no.
3088560	3089560	Have you heard of this?
3089560	3091560	Have you heard of TikTok?
3092560	3094560	Of course I've heard about TikTok.
3094560	3095560	Oh, I'm sorry.
3095560	3098560	Well, I learned about it today and I did a dance.
3098560	3099560	No, no.
3099560	3102560	Carol, no, you should see the dance I did.
3102560	3105560	It's posted on the Cannes TikTok for the station.
3105560	3106560	People liked it.
3108560	3109560	You'll see, I'm out there.
3109560	3112560	Hey, Carol, when you pull it up on your phone,
3112560	3115560	you see it's called the Calzone.
3115560	3116560	Oh, God.
3116560	3117560	Oh, God.
3117560	3120560	And he's doing a dance with a random guy on the street
3120560	3122560	who's doing a very cool dance
3122560	3125560	where it looks like he's sitting while he's upright
3125560	3128560	and dancing around in a sitting position.
3128560	3131560	And Cal does it perfectly alongside of him.
3131560	3133560	Wow, Dad, actually, that's pretty impressive.
3133560	3136560	You should, actually, you should keep doing that.
3136560	3139560	In a weird, twisted reality that we currently live in,
3139560	3143560	you would actually find more dates based on this video.
3143560	3145560	With women like your mother?
3148560	3150560	Women like my mom, sure.
3150560	3153560	But you should not narrow your, like,
3153560	3156560	there are plenty of women out there that aren't like mom.
3156560	3158560	Oh, well, that's the problem.
3159560	3161560	All right, Dad.
3161560	3166560	I have to go, but thank you for being supportive of my choices.
3166560	3168560	Try to get some sleep and then maybe we'll,
3168560	3170560	yeah, I'll check in with you tomorrow.
3170560	3173560	But I still, until I have some money,
3173560	3177560	maybe don't cancel my credit card yet.
3179560	3181560	I wouldn't dream of it, sweetie.
3181560	3183560	But again, don't tell your mother
3183560	3185560	she would cancel them in a heartbeat.
3186560	3187560	Thanks, Dad.
3187560	3190560	Yeah, take care of yourself and I'll talk to you tomorrow.
3190560	3192560	I love you very much.
3192560	3193560	I love you too, Dad.
3193560	3195560	And I, yeah, thank you.
3197560	3198560	Thank you.
3198560	3201560	This has been Cal Colorado.
3201560	3202560	Have a pleasant evening.
3203560	3205560	You really don't have, okay, fine.
3208560	3210560	Ellie, thank you so much for coming on the show.
3210560	3211560	Yeah, thank you, Ellie.
3211560	3212560	Oh, my God. That was great.
3212560	3213560	That was fun.
3213560	3215560	I'm very much looking forward to seeing
3215560	3219560	how this relationship thrives or...
3219560	3221560	Yeah, it was very, like, I love how, like,
3221560	3223560	I expected Zach to come in and be like,
3223560	3226560	and then all of a sudden her head falls off
3226560	3228560	and I'm like, she dies.
3228560	3229560	And I'm like, okay, cool.
3229560	3230560	We got a long ways to go.
3230560	3232560	We got time to fuck this shit up.
3232560	3234560	Yeah, there can definitely be a phone call
3234560	3235560	where your head falls off.
3235560	3237560	Hey, if that's what you want.
3237560	3239560	Is season two a homebrew as well?
3239560	3240560	Yeah.
3240560	3241560	Yeah, very nice.
3241560	3242560	It's all I can do.
3242560	3243560	I don't like reading.
3244560	3245560	You actually can't.
3246560	3247560	I'm too stupid.
3248560	3249560	It's a shame.
3272560	3274560	Life is great.
3275560	3277560	And it's all my fault.
