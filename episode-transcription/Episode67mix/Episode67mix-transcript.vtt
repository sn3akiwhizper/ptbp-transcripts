00:00.000 --> 00:15.820
Hey y'all, just in case y'all forgot, it is indeed 26 years ago, and for some reason,

00:15.820 --> 00:22.280
my voice can transmit to the past, from the present, and speaking of the present, y'all

00:22.280 --> 00:28.600
know I am here to bestow my vocal gifts upon all of y'all, no matter the when.

00:28.600 --> 00:37.440
Live from 694.2 PTBP, time traveling dogs named Wolf can be scary, but what is not scary

00:37.440 --> 00:45.780
is howling with Wolf, a segment I am definitely not forced to do against my will by my amorphous

00:45.780 --> 00:52.140
producer who may or may not possess ownership over my soul.

00:52.140 --> 00:58.400
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from At Perfect Us Nemo, who tweeted about the show

00:58.400 --> 01:00.700
and tagged at Pretending Pod.

01:00.700 --> 01:07.500
They wanted to hear your boy Wolf vocalize the frustrations of the BBEG in their own

01:07.500 --> 01:08.660
campaign.

01:08.660 --> 01:16.660
They write, I am the ancient, I am the land, I was vain, and due to my hubris, I lost my

01:16.660 --> 01:17.660
beloved.

01:17.660 --> 01:24.200
When I let outsiders into my own home, I was met with trickery and recklessness, going

01:24.200 --> 01:29.980
through my domain like a plague, destroying everything that was dear to me.

01:29.980 --> 01:35.980
Let them rally the creatures in the valley, let them storm my castle, all they will achieve

01:35.980 --> 01:40.540
is a long and painful prelude to an eternal march.

01:40.540 --> 01:45.780
And I shall wait as long as it is necessary, for nothing is gone forever.

01:45.780 --> 01:50.340
I will reclaim what is rightfully mine.

01:50.340 --> 01:58.060
Well that was certainly very fun and light hearted and not at all super fucked up dark

01:58.060 --> 01:59.060
and weird.

01:59.060 --> 02:05.220

Keep your eyes peeled for ooze and your ears tuned into the news.

03:46.940 --> 03:52.300
Last time we met our new friends in the meeting room of calm comfy campgrounds and followed

03:52.300 --> 03:55.260
along as they checked in for the weekend.

03:55.260 --> 04:02.100

04:15.860 --> 04:22.700
uptight newlywed is in cottage number 9 with his bohemian bride taking us back into the

04:56.740 --> 05:18.300
stormy do you have any guns i need to shoot my friend he would definitely drive over here

05:18.300 --> 05:23.660
with his pistol if i was like hey i need to shoot luke i love your dad and the thing is

05:23.660 --> 05:28.980
you he would act like if you asked him to he would probably kill me oh i don't know

05:28.980 --> 05:33.780
about that now he'd make me do my own dirty business yeah he would he would provide all

05:33.780 --> 05:41.140
the materials son i don't want you to do this but uh the man who passes the judgment ought

05:41.140 --> 05:46.480
to pull the trigger that's a good impression of your dad what was that fucking dude before

05:46.480 --> 05:52.100
we start i went and saw the gentleman oh yeah how was that fantastic oh so dying i love

05:52.100 --> 05:58.140
it was fucking good cool that makes me really excited who's the director is uh guy richie

05:58.140 --> 06:10.340
guy richie am i here no i've been doing that i'm sorry dude it was leaving the theater

06:10.340 --> 06:15.180
my parents were like yeah we thought it was going to be a stupid action movie and it was

06:15.180 --> 06:20.620
but we loved it oh hell yeah that sounds right in my eyes i'm totally fan-fucking-tastic

06:20.620 --> 06:26.340
a good guy richie it was yeah it was without some stinkers yeah yeah well it was not a

06:26.340 --> 06:36.660
sneaker it was like like snatch i never saw snatch what that's good yeah is it unlimited

06:36.660 --> 06:44.580
breath sticks what snatch is unlimited back six for sure it's my favorite rotten tomatoes

06:44.580 --> 06:52.500
anyway that's all i have to say all right so this man who just walked into the circular

06:52.500 --> 06:58.980
meeting room is wearing a white dress shirt gray slacks and black shoes there are six

06:58.980 --> 07:05.360
chairs and a half circle all facing a single chair that this man stands in front of as

07:05.360 --> 07:11.300
he introduces himself hello there folks my name is james and i am the executive director

07:11.300 --> 07:23.680
here at calm comfy campground i need everyone to roll a constitution check what pass fail

07:23.680 --> 07:32.380
pass solid fail okay so justin charles digby and thomas bradley cooper would both realize

07:32.380 --> 07:40.980
that that's your name that this room is sort of tilted as you're walking to your seats

07:40.980 --> 07:48.400
you feel an uneasiness in your balance as this room is tilted a bit toward the chair

07:48.400 --> 07:54.560
that is alone on the other side and you all sit down in this half circle and he sits down

07:54.560 --> 07:58.120
with you i pull the chair out for angela even though there's nothing that she's scooting

07:58.120 --> 08:02.880
up to i just kind of stand behind and pull it out let her sit and push it under thank

08:02.880 --> 08:08.920
you so much for really like seeing me in that moment and acknowledging that i'm here of

08:08.920 --> 08:13.740
course i want to start by introducing myself and telling you a little bit about this place

08:13.740 --> 08:21.040
we obviously as you know uh specialize in taking people who need to focus on something

08:21.040 --> 08:27.600
and get that focus either a little bit more accurate or there at all some people need

08:27.600 --> 08:33.180
to be forced all the way in so uh we're just here to help you achieve whatever desires

08:33.180 --> 08:39.220
you may be heading toward we can help you with that goal and i just think the group

08:39.220 --> 08:44.120
session is the best way to start any of these sort of weekend events so if everyone could

08:44.120 --> 08:49.100
go around and introduce themselves i think that would be absolutely fantastic well i

08:49.100 --> 08:57.100
am angela fairfield and i'm here with my husband raj hey hey there hey there folks and we're

08:57.100 --> 09:03.980
here to really focus on like moving forward in our marriage and making this thing last

09:03.980 --> 09:09.500
and and really like we both care so much about each other that i think that we're going to

09:09.500 --> 09:15.340
be able to do it right raj we're certainly gonna gonna try of course i'll do i'm open

09:15.340 --> 09:27.060
and uh i'm willing and was that walter clapping walter claps james looks around the room at

09:27.060 --> 09:34.060
the others okay well uh let's uh jump in here uh i like to play two truths and a lie to

09:34.060 --> 09:39.200
get things started so basically how this works is we'll go around the half circle here and

09:39.200 --> 09:47.300
everyone will say three statements two of which are true and one of which is a lie and

09:47.300 --> 09:52.940
after you say the three statements we'll each go around and ask a question about the three

09:52.940 --> 09:57.740
statements to try to determine which one the lie is right so we'll ask a question you'll

09:57.740 --> 10:01.520
have to answer it and then we can all kind of gauge who each other are and how we react

10:01.520 --> 10:06.760
to each other i've got a question shoot psychologically what is the point of this game oh it's just

10:06.760 --> 10:11.340
to help with these group sessions moving along we really want there to be an air of openness

10:11.340 --> 10:15.600
and vulnerability and so we think the best way to do that is to have you all know each

10:15.600 --> 10:22.360
other why lie in the background i ask alan what is openness it's just a willingness to

10:22.360 --> 10:27.440
connect with others i believe who the fuck is alan thank you alan is the older man who

10:27.440 --> 10:32.860
is the tall lead man wearing the charcoal suit who is there with the 16 year old walter

10:32.860 --> 10:37.740
when he notices that they're there together i give you guys both like a strange look i

10:37.740 --> 10:42.780
am still just looking at my feet taking this in i lean to the council it was like a batman

10:42.780 --> 10:48.880
situation as his ward puts yeah i think it's definitely a batman type situation uh they

10:48.880 --> 10:53.180
can probably explain to you their father-son dynamic more than i could but let's go ahead

10:53.180 --> 10:57.500
and start with uh charles digby down there you got two treats in the life for me sir

10:57.500 --> 11:03.300
yeah i got a couple for you fire away i blackmailed the mayor of the city i have an overweight

11:03.300 --> 11:04.700
cat named rolo

11:04.700 --> 11:17.300
she's working on it she was you guys stopped i sold one of my kidneys to buy my new car

11:17.300 --> 11:21.360
oh those are some spicy ones all right let's go around the circle here and ask some questions

11:21.360 --> 11:31.680
let's start with you bradley why'd you sell your kidney i mean what kind of car

11:31.680 --> 11:42.060
it's a uh a new mobile lie that's the lie i agree did you show us your belly i would

11:42.060 --> 11:48.480
like to ask openness i would like to show us go with his line of questioning and ask

11:48.480 --> 11:54.120
to see the renal scar i don't feel comfortable enough with you guys to to do that i look

11:54.120 --> 11:58.800
at uh what's your character's name bradley cooper that's not a famous person's name yeah

11:58.800 --> 12:05.940
i look at bradley and i go i agree with your thought it is a lie thanks charles how much

12:05.940 --> 12:11.600
is uh kidney going for these days it's about 20 000 or so did the car cost all of that

12:11.600 --> 12:16.260
money or did you have some left over i had some left over what'd you spend it on got

12:16.260 --> 12:21.620
a new camera what was your first lie my first lie that you ever told the first lie that

12:21.620 --> 12:26.700
no the first lie of the three that you read you uh you blackmailed a mayor what was that

12:26.700 --> 12:32.420
about i had some stuff on them what did you have on the mayor dad i can handle this oh

12:32.420 --> 12:37.580
i'm part of the group as well and i would like to contribute so what what did you have

12:37.580 --> 12:44.040
on the mayor there alan let the kids be i accept the line of questioning i'm not allowed

12:44.040 --> 12:49.140
i'm not allowed to discuss it that's part of the blackmail deal did you get money for

12:49.140 --> 12:54.620
it or was it some other yes you got money for it for blackmailing the mayor yes i do

12:54.620 --> 13:01.640
want to reiterate that this is two truths and a lie both of these seem like lies but

13:01.640 --> 13:06.080
one of them isn't one of them's fake he got money from either blackmailing the mayor or

13:06.080 --> 13:12.860
selling his kidney that's how i pulled up here in a new mobile i but he wouldn't need

13:12.860 --> 13:18.720
money twice no one needs no one needs more money so i i reached my things i reached my

13:18.720 --> 13:26.060
hand out and poke him in like the side walter i like where where a kidney scar would be

13:26.060 --> 13:32.620
walter you can't just poke people i i also go in and start it is part of this is part

13:32.620 --> 13:37.280
of the game i have to win the second thing he said let's go ahead and try to not touch

13:37.280 --> 13:41.340
each other during this game if that's okay with i'm pretty uncomfortable with what's

13:41.340 --> 13:47.880
happening here what was the second thing he said hey do i feel a scar through my can i

13:47.880 --> 13:56.840
roll that can i roll like search or something yeah roll search no roll surgery tied i got

13:56.840 --> 14:09.660
30 in surgery that's a 10 oh my god okay you go ahead and roll a d10 for damage three

14:09.660 --> 14:17.700
okay and so if you can i get a pencil please as you reach in uh before charles can pull

14:17.700 --> 14:29.940
away charles does he feel a surgery scar there he does not oh i believe that that is the

14:29.940 --> 14:35.340
lie if he touched him and there's no scar if there's no scar i bet that's the lie i

14:35.340 --> 14:44.140
agree calm down i get like really fucking uncomfortable and i'm like kind of like hugging

14:44.140 --> 14:47.780
myself a little bit like looking down at the ground and i'm like what was the second thing

14:47.780 --> 14:52.940
he said i have an overweight cat named rolo why don't you put it on a diet or something

14:52.940 --> 15:01.940
she's trying i feel like that is the truth all right let's go ahead and uh i think everyone

15:01.940 --> 15:07.060
is made vocal their choices there hold on buddy so what'd you get from the mayor i'm

15:07.060 --> 15:11.300
not allowed to say i want to human that okay roll human for me you said money though didn't

15:11.300 --> 15:19.620
i thought he said money oh i did say money i successfully roll human and i say wait a

15:19.620 --> 15:25.300
minute earlier you said it was money oh fuck how much money what was the secret

15:28.500 --> 15:33.300
i i can't say all right i think he's repeated that a couple times so let's go ahead and get

15:33.300 --> 15:39.300
you to come clean here which one was the line what were the truths the truths were i did in fact

15:39.380 --> 15:46.020

15:46.660 --> 15:54.580
named rolo after her favorite candy that might have something to do with it yeah what do you

15:54.580 --> 16:01.140

purpose of the game you better yeah i i don't think maybe you should participate in the

20:39.540 --> 20:45.220
questioning on this one but i look down at my feet and stand motionless who's your favorite

20:45.220 --> 20:50.900
character on the beverly hillbillies milburn driesdale he's a good businessman and he's just

20:50.900 --> 20:55.620
trying to keep the money in his bank what does steak taste like steak oh i like the meaty

20:56.420 --> 21:01.300
just ripping something apart questioning what's uh what what's that's a ribeye part from from

21:01.300 --> 21:09.940
other steaks why is it so special to you i love the fat i like how fat it is uh nothing i like

21:09.940 --> 21:16.820
more than just the fat on a steak do you uh know the theme song to beverly hillbillies flanston

21:17.620 --> 21:27.940
no uh i i do i do i do just let me get there black gold oil that is i lean over to and yeah

21:31.700 --> 21:35.060
i lean over to angela that's how you figure it out pretty quick

21:35.860 --> 21:40.180
okay you're right okay it's not my favorite show i've seen it a couple times i i like

21:40.180 --> 21:45.460
that milburn driesdale but i i just couldn't think of anything else on the spot you got me

21:45.460 --> 21:53.860
okay well i guess that was pretty short wind damn got it oh my god walter looks up and says

21:53.860 --> 22:01.460
black gold oil that is uh walter if you want to go next following your father there this is going

22:01.460 --> 22:08.340
to be very difficult for me because i do not like to lie but i will do it for the sake of community

22:08.340 --> 22:20.900
i don't own a bed i had a total hip replacement last year and i have only owned one pair of shoes

22:20.900 --> 22:26.820
as an adult i want to look tennis yeah i look at the shoes what do them shoes look like what

22:26.820 --> 22:32.980
do they look like they are pristine white new balances okay i'm pretty sure i know the lie

22:32.980 --> 22:37.780
but just to be sure i want to kick them in the hip not like hard i want to like knock them over

22:37.780 --> 22:43.620
with my foot what i just want to see if he can stand or if his hip got replaced bradley that is

22:43.620 --> 22:48.740
not the kind of behavior that we want to do here well but you're reacting to that as what was the

22:48.740 --> 22:54.740
result of my behavior is he on the ground as bradley's foot comes up to my hip i grab it that'll

22:54.740 --> 23:01.940
be a strength yeah let's see hold on strength or can i use martial arts you can use martial arts

23:02.820 --> 23:08.900
either way i got martial arts i got an 85 unarmed combat don't roll don't roll worse than me

23:09.940 --> 23:20.100
i got a one so fucking kill him he shatters your hip no it's contested whether or not it was

23:20.900 --> 23:29.540
you destroy this child what do you want to do oh i just want to kind of like push him with my foot

23:29.540 --> 23:35.940
and see if he can stand up i want to test his hip all right as his foot comes into me i try to

23:35.940 --> 23:43.060
grab it but his foot is moving too fast he hits me in the hip and pushes me over like three inches

23:43.060 --> 23:48.020
but then i immediately stand back up completely straight roger jumps out of his chair hey whoa

23:48.020 --> 23:52.980
yeah that's not the kind of behavior that we want to like do in these group sessions like i said

23:52.980 --> 23:57.380
about touching people earlier it's mostly a physical thing that i'm talking about right now

23:57.380 --> 24:02.020
so if we want to not do that from here on moving forward otherwise i'm gonna have to

24:02.020 --> 24:07.220
as soon as this happens i i stand straight and look down in my shoes are you all right walter

24:07.220 --> 24:13.460
i am fine bradley is telling me that i am lying he's like in a practiced kung fu stance he's kind

24:13.460 --> 24:17.860
of bouncing on the heels of his feet but he sits down when you sit back down walter alan kind of

24:17.860 --> 24:23.060
pats you on the leg and he's like you did a great job just then my father has told me three strikes

24:23.060 --> 24:29.380
and you're out that is one strike but i don't hold it against you cool

24:31.620 --> 24:35.940
tell me how i'm lying if you don't own a bed let's say that that's the truth

24:35.940 --> 24:43.380
where do you sleep i don't typically lay down usually i tend to sleep standing where are you

24:43.380 --> 24:50.980
a vampire yeah what are you a vampire angel no i he's funny i can't consume blood so no i'm

24:50.980 --> 24:57.620
not a vampire okay i want to get this over with i feel uncomfortable telling a lie because it's

24:58.260 --> 25:04.740
against what i believe in what do you believe in well many things but that's not the point of this

25:04.740 --> 25:10.100
exercise to get to know one another right yeah but that's it what's at your core kid you would

25:10.100 --> 25:16.420
have to ask my father that i did not i've not asked that question but i i think that is beside

25:16.420 --> 25:23.700
the point of this exercise please tell me how i'm lying you should walk across the room for us

25:23.700 --> 25:31.380
i walk across the room can i see if he's favoring one hit versus the other yeah uh we already tested

25:35.380 --> 25:42.500
i i walk across the room perfectly normal oh roger is just gonna point at your shoes i i think it's

25:42.500 --> 25:46.100
the shoes guys they don't look like he's had them all his life yeah i'm gonna go with the shoes

25:46.580 --> 25:53.860
that's wild otherwise same i look at my father am i allowed to tell the truth now go ahead i

25:53.860 --> 26:00.660
have not had a hip replacement i have the hips oh i forgot about the hip god damn it that was

30:43.620 --> 30:51.700

30:51.700 --> 30:57.220
and physical activity during our group sessions and the whole weekend here sorry i've been i'm

30:57.220 --> 31:02.420
really tense that's why i'm trying to i whisper to angela and we're gonna steer clear of him

31:02.420 --> 31:09.620
no joke i look up at raj and angela duly noted me too and look back down on my feet

31:15.860 --> 31:22.180

sights around here and he points up as the sun is going down and he's like look at that sunset and

31:51.300 --> 31:57.300
you just see the sun is going down behind these mountains off in the distance and on this side of

31:57.300 --> 32:04.340
that sunset is just trees for as far as you can see up until this lake hold on hold on i'm sorry

32:04.340 --> 32:09.380
i've got to take this and uh bradley waters off from the group on his cell phone that'll happen

32:09.380 --> 32:15.540
so i i don't know if he's gonna get very good service out here but can i try a role that lets

32:15.540 --> 32:21.140
me uh eavesdrop on his side of the conversation but from the group like i'm just gonna stop paying

32:21.140 --> 32:24.900
attention to james and try and hear what he's saying on his side of his phone yeah for sure

32:24.900 --> 32:36.340
roll uh search active perception i pass a three on a 60 okay fantastic i told you it needs to be

32:36.340 --> 32:43.540
off white not cream not white not whatever the fuck kind of gray you thought this would be it

32:43.540 --> 32:50.420
needs to be off white okay off white cool flowers of all different shades and shapes you know have

32:50.420 --> 32:56.980

stout man in his later years and as you approach you see that he's got a thick white beard that

36:57.620 --> 37:05.460
makes his round face look even rounder the bags under his eyes are large and fluffy and he's

37:05.460 --> 37:15.940
wearing a dark fluffy fluffy okay the thick luxurious fur you started to say puffy and then

37:15.940 --> 37:26.580
you changed to fluffy you just really want to take a nap on these bags he's wearing a dark navy beanie

37:26.580 --> 37:32.980
and a wool plaid shirt underneath olive corduroy overalls i'm thinking about the guy that plays

37:32.980 --> 37:37.780
trumpet in neutral milk hotel well i'm always thinking about the guy who plays trumpet in

37:37.780 --> 37:44.660
neutral milk hotel uh yeah so everyone this is jack russell the boat man and he'll be taking

37:44.660 --> 37:49.540
care of all your canoe needs i'm gonna head on back so after you wrap up here and get all your

37:49.540 --> 37:57.060
information you can go back onto your cottages or feel free to roam the grounds and he takes off

37:57.060 --> 38:05.380
back down the large flaky flock and walk a flock of lake and he walks back and he's gone roger

38:05.380 --> 38:10.740
holds out a hand to jack jack i'm roger i'm curious what kind of not to use around here

38:12.900 --> 38:19.220
honestly for uh for my ties you know i go with the fucking shit yeah i was doing you doing you

38:19.220 --> 38:23.060
oh fuck oh i thought you were i was doing i thought you were doing jebediah from the

38:23.060 --> 38:29.780
plus what kind of uh knots are using here on the stock uh i assume a clove hitch you

38:29.780 --> 38:34.260
got anything uh special up your sleeve hey you know it's mostly clove hitch you know it's uh

38:34.260 --> 38:41.060
do it again for ties you know i got windsor man after my heart i see and yeah so everyone here

38:41.060 --> 38:46.740
you know come down come close you know get around here we got six canoes right and so there's enough

38:46.740 --> 38:51.380
for everyone to take them out whenever you need them you're gonna want to go ahead and grab a life

38:51.380 --> 38:56.420
jacket there's life jackets right over here and he points at a bin it's got a bunch of life jackets

38:56.420 --> 39:02.260
in it you're all seemingly adults he looks at you walter he's like except for you how old are you

39:03.140 --> 39:10.020
what is the number that you need to hear all right it seems smart enough so all of you will

39:10.020 --> 39:15.380
be required to take out life jackets in the canoes with you and you head on out but you don't have to

39:15.380 --> 39:19.780
wear them except for i'm guessing you if you're under 18 you might want to have that on for the

39:19.780 --> 39:25.380
galatee reasons should i put two of them on you can put two of them on if you want but it'll be

39:25.380 --> 39:30.580
safer if you just have one duly noted all right so you're never gonna go out without them and

39:30.580 --> 39:34.820
you're never gonna go out by yourself in a canoe if you go out by yourself in a canoe you're gonna

39:34.820 --> 39:41.460
have a bad time we always say stick to two in a canoe right so you gotta have two people in the

39:41.460 --> 39:47.380
canoe what do we gotta have in a canoe to make it work that's right the canoe good job everyone

39:47.380 --> 39:52.580
thank you for paying attention honestly this is great so many groups get into in talking and

39:52.580 --> 39:59.700
doing different voices it's very obnoxious what do you mean i don't even know why i brought it up

39:59.700 --> 40:04.180
that's on me that's my bad everyone i'm so sorry why did i even invite that into the realm of

40:04.180 --> 40:11.060
possibility so that's why we always stick to two in a canoe so stuff like that doesn't happen all

40:11.060 --> 40:17.300
right now these waters these waters out here you look at them they're very calm right but

40:17.300 --> 40:25.140
that's tricky isn't it it is it no not so much it's very easy to can do around this lake

40:28.900 --> 40:34.340
however some people get a big head right i'm guessing you just looking at everything about you

40:34.340 --> 40:39.380
you're probably going to get a bit cocky out there and there's nothing that the water takes

40:39.380 --> 40:45.860
as such a dis to its face i say dis all the time it's one of my favorite words i mean it's

40:45.860 --> 40:51.780
perfectly acceptable 26 years ago hey we're living in the past mate i'm living in the future i mean

40:51.780 --> 40:56.100
hypothetically and so the water right it's it's mean

40:59.300 --> 41:05.540
right it's me but it's yeah i'm scared it's super fucking calm right but you know it can be mean

41:05.540 --> 41:10.980
at times right because the water is the most powerful thing that exists on this realm outside

41:10.980 --> 41:18.580
of all and he looks up into the sky and the sun has gone down now so you've got just a beautiful

41:18.580 --> 41:26.820
sight of the countless stars up in the sky except for those right mate right the endlessness of

41:26.820 --> 41:34.420
space isn't it if you get out there there's nothing more powerful sometimes i feel like

41:34.420 --> 41:40.900
maybe i'm just floating and all of this is some sort of mental reaction to everything

41:40.900 --> 41:47.860
that i'm having as i'm just losing oxygen i'm i'm sorry jack russell have you been to space

41:48.980 --> 41:55.540
no no but sometimes i look up there and i wonder if maybe i'm not down here you know you ever get

41:55.540 --> 42:01.940
that yes i would also posit that water would still be powerful up there in fact maybe more

42:01.940 --> 42:06.820
so you could use it to stay alive or to push off of something if you needed to you could

42:06.820 --> 42:15.780
shoot it out of a hose or when you were talking about this clouds are also water so technically

42:15.780 --> 42:23.700
in the sky there is water as well so i think that just adds to what you are talking about you guys

42:23.700 --> 42:29.540
are all really validating me at this time and i appreciate it you know it's not too many times

42:29.540 --> 42:35.220
that we get people who are not so raw and ready at the beginning of the weekend you know some

42:35.220 --> 42:40.340
people are a bit meft in the head so it's nice that you guys are all taking a group mentality

42:40.340 --> 42:45.380
to try to validate each other's existences and thoughts and i really appreciate that so does

42:45.380 --> 42:51.940
everyone have well it's just shit we are doing each other i do in the same voice oh i want brad

42:51.940 --> 43:00.980
lincoln i'm gay and i want your job um honestly i think we're all just uh i think we feel a little

43:00.980 --> 43:07.780
protective of you because of the the thick and fluffy patch of hair underneath your eyes it's

43:07.780 --> 43:14.900
pretty adorable he rubs it and he's like yeah it's been on my face a long time in there is it

43:14.900 --> 43:21.380
now i grew it over the summer it's nice though to have a bit of protection from all this wind

43:21.380 --> 43:25.860
and you know if you happen to get into water it's nice to have it and you know not you just sort of

43:25.860 --> 43:32.660
feel are you laughing at me this is like a if snl try to do colin farrell i am colin farrell

43:33.780 --> 43:39.780
and i'm bradley cooper and maybe in 26 years those names will be famous but not today no

43:39.780 --> 43:45.540
it's a fucking fairy tale here though but also isn't your name jack russell yeah my name is jack

43:45.540 --> 43:54.740
russell what's happening hey i think we're just terrible hey jack if we do take a boat out is

43:54.740 --> 43:59.780
there any place you recommend maybe a nice cove somewhere or something yeah you'll find no coves

43:59.780 --> 44:05.460
around this area right so it's just circles on circles so we got a circular island with a

44:05.460 --> 44:12.740
circular lake right around it engulfing it eating it alive from the inside you're gonna find just

44:12.820 --> 44:17.940
roundness at all the points around i'm so sorry jack wouldn't be eating it alive from the outside

44:17.940 --> 44:23.860
of the you know what you're right it is it's an external force this water is right pushing against

44:23.860 --> 44:30.500
just over and over repeatedly just thrusting thrusting thrusting there's water at the bottom

44:30.500 --> 44:41.700
of the ocean oh does anyone have any questions uh are these our boats like uh stand down one

44:41.700 --> 44:48.580
so we got is it but specifically like is my boat that one no or or take out any of them that you

44:48.580 --> 44:53.620
want anyone that's left here you can take out right and so to answer your question there sir

44:53.620 --> 45:02.100
young sprightly man it's gonna be right over there and he points to this spot that the shoreline has

45:02.100 --> 45:07.940
clearly even from this distance you can tell canoes have like entered this shoreline and left

45:07.940 --> 45:13.060
a bunch of divots up there and he's like right there that's a good trail that's the best trail

45:13.060 --> 45:18.740
on the property so like a cross yeah across the water yeah got it yeah there's no trails on this

45:18.740 --> 45:24.340
side except for the walkways you know from the cottages back up to big house charles digby takes

45:24.340 --> 45:28.980
this time to pull out a little notepad that he always keeps with him to take notes and looking

45:28.980 --> 45:36.020
at the like creepy almost obsidian like water he starts like jotting down notes for ideas i love it

45:36.020 --> 45:40.500
there you go i'm into it yeah thanks for saying it you're welcome i think it's a good character

45:40.500 --> 45:45.620
choice for you yeah it might have something to do with something gotta keep an eye on this one

45:46.580 --> 45:57.220
he writes shit down i approach the water and i scoop a handful of water up and then i put my

45:57.220 --> 46:06.420
hand in my back pocket i just see his pocket get wet i'm noticing the rings of the water the ripple

46:06.420 --> 46:11.620
effect yeah kid i'm not paying attention i'm looking back down on my feet again kid are you

46:11.620 --> 46:18.340
any good with computers no reaction sometimes he just doesn't react is he good at computers hey

46:18.340 --> 46:24.660
he's fine with computers what about you sir are you a computer man me bradley cooper yeah what

46:24.660 --> 46:35.620
do you do i i manage a gas station wow interesting yeah what's that like as you can imagine it's

46:35.620 --> 46:42.580
hard an oil man and i look back down indirectly i suppose yeah petroleum byproducts he's a bit of

46:42.580 --> 46:48.260
a middleman do not degrade this man father i do think of myself as uh more of a salesman than

46:48.260 --> 46:56.100
anything okay so i guess we should head out is there anything else jack that's pretty much it

46:56.100 --> 47:03.140
unless anyone has any more questions about the water the canoes or how to get from here to there

47:03.140 --> 47:08.260
on this cold water but just remember what do we remember always have a life jacket for each

47:08.260 --> 47:14.500
person in the canoe two canoes or something two canoes for each person two canoes for each person

47:14.500 --> 47:19.780
that's right i don't i don't think that was no that's what he said like a chariot trick horse

47:19.780 --> 47:27.540
racer one can one foot in each and i think it was uh one canoe 23 skidoo you can split your

47:27.540 --> 47:33.780
pants but it's it's a good time can you remind us what it was again yeah so we always say

47:39.540 --> 47:42.420
i looked at my computer and it says two truths and a lie

47:44.660 --> 47:47.940
that's why we always stick to

47:50.340 --> 47:54.180
what hold on what did i roll 50 to a canoe

47:56.900 --> 48:01.860
that's why we always say 50 to a canoe all right two in a canoe anyone have any more questions are

48:01.860 --> 48:07.060
we done here if uh somebody hypothetically wanted to get out on the lake and they were alone would

48:07.060 --> 48:12.340
you accompany them how does that yeah yeah if you ever want to go out there by yourself and have a

48:12.340 --> 48:17.940
bit of quiet i got these and he points up at the wall and there's some like noise canceling like

48:17.940 --> 48:21.700
gear that you would wear if you were doing construction or something like that if you

48:21.700 --> 48:26.100
ever want to have a bit of peace and quiet you know i'll just put that in and read if that'll

48:26.100 --> 48:32.260
be all then i think your name really i started i think maybe we should leave where your next

48:32.260 --> 48:42.580
campground members the beatings we're here for fun and relaxing non-spooky weekend it's 56 years ago

48:45.220 --> 48:49.060
that's right can we take a picture of rb road

48:51.540 --> 48:57.780
can we do that what's on the other side of the lake oh just woods mate just woods and woods

48:57.780 --> 49:03.780
it's some nice trails there if you got some some time are there any uh fish in this lake oh i

49:03.780 --> 49:08.420
thought you're gonna say on the trails and no there aren't but there are my question is could

49:08.420 --> 49:15.620
i have never been fishing before but i've heard about it is it possible to go fishing in this

49:15.620 --> 49:22.740
lake unfortunately for you there so walter you're not gonna find any fish in this lake well that's

49:23.700 --> 49:28.180
well that's fine why are there no fish in this lake yeah roger's looking puzzled too

49:28.180 --> 49:32.580
no no fish in the lake they stocked all these lakes back in the day when they first dammed

49:32.580 --> 49:38.340
them up as long as i've been here there's been no fishes in this lake is this a man-made lake

49:38.340 --> 49:44.660
yeah it's a man-made lake what do you have a deal with that no then i guess we don't have a problem

49:44.660 --> 49:52.020
what holy shit that was a bit strong it's jack sparrow hiding out

49:53.700 --> 49:59.060
and you're poking the bear i could go a bit of a problem that's the day you almost caught jack

49:59.060 --> 50:07.460
russell

50:29.060 --> 50:39.460
you

50:47.540 --> 50:53.460
this

50:59.060 --> 51:07.460
i think
