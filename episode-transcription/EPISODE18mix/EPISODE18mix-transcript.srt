00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
Hello all my nephews and nieces, it is your fun uncle, Wolf the Dog, and I'm here to

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:14,120
weird y'all out from 694.2 PTBP Contention's Greatest Radio Show.

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:20,800
This episode is brought to you by Fire Lizard Games, a tabletop games company based in Springfield

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,480
run by just three brothers.

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:31,200
They currently have a Kickstarter launched in their first game, Base, a card PG.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:38,680
Base is a setting agnostic storytelling game using a simple, uniquely designed system.

7
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,120
They designed the game to be appealing for everyone, whether you are a newcomer to roleplaying

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,520
games or a stone cold pro.

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,680
All you need to play the game is the rulebook, a standard deck of cards, and a few six-sided

10
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,680
dice.

11
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,560
The Kickstarter tiers start as low as $3 and it will end on April 16th, my babies.

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,840
Give them a follow on Facebook for your buddy Wolf, or Instagram, or Twitter, or how about

13
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,200
all three, at Fire Lizard Games for more updates.

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,040
And now let's get back to my favorite segment, Howlin' with Wolf, where we get to hear from

15
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,720
our caring, adoring, and intelligent listeners.

16
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,280
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Hot Donna on Twitter, who writes,

17
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,880
After careful consideration, my request is as follows.

18
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,200
Instead of making an actual announcement, I would love for Wolf to make one incredibly

19
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,880
long and possibly melodic fart noise.

20
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,040
Ahem, I guess it might go something like,

21
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:02,160
Well, Hot Donna, I hope that made you happy inside, cuz, uh, yeah.

22
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,760
Anyway, it's time to remember what happened last time, it's the news.

23
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,640
Turns out, maybe Keith is a monster to be around because his dad was a dick who clearly

24
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,000
preferred his older son, Ferguson.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,280
Now that's not an excuse, Officer Vigna is the worst person in contention.

26
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,560
While playing on the family's sprawling estate, Keith and Ferguson heard the sirens blaring

27
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,880
as strange, gaunt men in suits appeared to fall from the sky and were shot down by the

28
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,360
Bean's security personnel.

29
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,520
Later that night, William Beans gave Ferguson a watch and told him about a prophecy that

30
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,800
says he will save the world.

31
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,400
Back in whatever year it is now, the officers took the pastor's helmet to the police station

32
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,360
and locked it up with the other items from the booth at Forgotten Treasures.

33
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,000
The light on the camera was green, so John took a picture of Keith outside the station.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,480
Unsurprisingly, the picture was not of Keith, but of two men in a strange room that lacked

35
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,720
color.

36
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,560
On the way to the mill, on the other side of the city, John saw something strange in

37
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,480
the sky, causing a fiery three car wreck on the main longitudinal drag of contention.

38
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,040
Taking us to that scene now, is Kudzu with no backbone.

39
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:56,840
I need everyone to roll power.

40
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,720
I fail.

41
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,840
I'm the most powerful motherfucker.

42
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,600
I fail, 96 on a 60.

43
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,440
I got an 86 on a 50.

44
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,440
Okay.

45
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,000
You have all been in a car wreck.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,880
You have the choice to either stay put in the exact position that you're in or to move.

47
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,460
Now real quick, I'm going to have you all roll a D6 for hit points to see how many you

48
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,320
lost from the wreck.

49
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,320
Four.

50
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
One.

51
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
Two.

52
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,240
That puts me at 24.

53
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,240
I'm at 14.

54
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,880
Luke said he was at 19.

55
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,080
I'm at 19.

56
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
My name is Keith.

57
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
Oh yeah.

58
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
Oh no.

59
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
Oh no.

60
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
Keith.

61
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,080
Oh no.

62
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
Luke, it's you.

63
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
I'm at 19.

64
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,320
Guys, I was in a car wreck tonight, I don't know if I can finish the episode.

65
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:03,560
You all hear this vehicle that is flown off the side of the road on fire.

66
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,880
Do you move or do you stay put?

67
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,880
I move.

68
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
I move.

69
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,880
Is my car still operational?

70
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
Is it on?

71
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
No.

72
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,880
I move.

73
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,880
Okay.

74
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,680
I got their power check.

75
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,680
Just John.

76
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,960
John, you lose one willpower and I need the other two to roll a D4 for me.

77
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
One.

78
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,960
Three.

79
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,040
That was willpower?

80
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,040
It was indeed.

81
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,320
Well, Clark Bishop is at seven willpower, John Lee Pettymore is at 11 willpower.

82
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,320
I'm at one.

83
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,560
However, yes, Keith Vigna is at one willpower.

84
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,880
I thought you did all the coke to gain willpower.

85
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,560
I did the coke to not have a minus 20 to my rolls.

86
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,280
When you get down to one or two willpower, you're at a negative 20% on all rolls.

87
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,840
Now, Keith Vigna, having lost willpower at this point, you were back at a negative 20%

88
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,600
on all rolls.

89
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,600
And so your high of your cane-

90
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,220
It was so harsh, dude.

91
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,360
It was harsh as fuck.

92
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,680
You no longer have the-

93
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
I do more.

94
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,680
Advantages.

95
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,960
So you guys are all in the car wreck and John passed his power roll and so he's spending

96
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,720
one willpower to move.

97
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,480
Keith and Clark both failed their power rolls and so they had to roll a D4 in order to find

98
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,560
out how much willpower they were going to lose in order to move.

99
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,140
Keith is losing one willpower point to move.

100
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,740
Clark failed and is spending three willpower points to move.

101
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:36,400
Clark is driving one cruiser with Keith sitting shotgun and John is driving the cruiser ahead

102
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,240
that got rear ended by Clark's cruiser.

103
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,960
Now, John, I need you to roll luck for me.

104
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,600
John's luck is 55.

105
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Yes.

106
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
98.

107
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,160
And he fails.

108
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:56,760
So I need you to roll a dexterity check to try to get out of your seat, which your seat

109
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,880
belt is completely jammed and you're stuck in your seat currently.

110
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,960
11.

111
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,040
Critical success.

112
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,320
You want to describe how you get out of this car in a very cool way?

113
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,320
Yeah.

114
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,300
We describe how I'm stuck again real quick.

115
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:16,520
You got crunched from the back and so your seat literally moved forward and your knees

116
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:22,400
went into the console of your cruiser, breaking through the plastic on either side of the

117
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,280
steering wheel and so your knees are like cut up and bleeding from the plastic and you

118
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,760
hit your head on the steering wheel and so you're kind of dazed and your seat has moved

119
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,120
forward in a way to where your seat belt has jammed you into position.

120
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,240
Oh, I don't know how I'm going to get out of that.

121
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,400
That sounds really bad.

122
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,920
You can do anything to get out of this because you rolled a critical success.

123
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,200
He chews his way out.

124
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,600
Like a rat in a...

125
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:53,280
Yeah, I think he just takes his flashlight and just bangs it against the seat belt a

126
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,360
few times and gets lucky.

127
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,520
Yeah, wiggles out the window basically while doing a somersault because it's a crit success.

128
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,400
Oh, can I trade in for doing something really cool for my crit success with noticing a little

129
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,700
bit more about the situation as I get out because what I'm really interested in is what's

130
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:15,160
happened to what was hit, who was hit, and what's all going on.

131
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,160
Absolutely.

132
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:23,460
So as you make it out of your police cruiser, you would notice not only has your police

133
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:29,900
cruiser caught fire, but you look over and you actually see the other vehicle that you

134
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,140
ran off the road by swerving into their lane.

135
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,540
It's a minivan.

136
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:40,300
It is flipped over and it is currently leaking fluid all over the ground.

137
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,300
Keith, I need you to roll luck.

138
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,100
A 70 and a 65.

139
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,060
You are pinched.

140
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:54,540
Your cruiser with Clark driving smashed into the back of John's cruiser.

141
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,100
Your airbag went off.

142
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,380
It knocked you back and...

143
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,220
My penis fell off.

144
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,220
I used my penis to unlock...

145
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,220
Grab it.

146
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,220
Grab it with the door.

147
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,220
I grab his penis.

148
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,220
Thanks, Clark.

149
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:13,580
Your side of the car got completely smashed in and so your door is unable to open.

150
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:18,300
So you're going to have to smash through the window to get out of this vehicle.

151
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,340
So I need you to roll strength for me.

152
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,780
10 on a 55.

153
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,780
All right.

154
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,780
So...

155
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,780
I...

156
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,660
Give me a second to think about it.

157
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:33,700
Oh, I take my handy dandy handgun and use the butt of it to just...

158
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,900
And I am very careful not to cut myself.

159
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,340
Fire some warning shots outside for you.

160
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:46,620
No, I like to conserve my ammunition for people that threaten me or people I want to threaten.

161
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,940
So yeah, I do that.

162
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,980
And then do I have a move or...

163
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:57,220
So you can use your turn to get out of the vehicle and as you do get out of the vehicle,

164
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:02,620
you would notice that this cruiser that you were in, Clark's cruiser, is also leaking

165
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,540
fluid all over the ground underneath the vehicle.

166
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,020
Clark, I need you to roll luck for me.

167
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,460
53 on a 75.

168
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,460
Okay.

169
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:16,460
I mean, you already spent your three willpower to make a move action this round.

170
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:22,220
So you can use that to get out of the car or do anything else that you want to do.

171
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,780
No, I just want to get out of the car.

172
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,780
Okay, awesome.

173
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,860
You get out of the car, you would notice as well that there is liquid underneath your

174
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,180
car and you would also see John's cruiser is catching fire.

175
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:40,460
You all look over and see this minivan that has swerved off the road is completely upside

176
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:45,780
down and dark liquid coming out all over the place.

177
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,780
Round two.

178
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,140
I need everyone to roll power in order to move.

179
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,140
Fuck.

180
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,620
No, 68 on a 60.

181
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,100
I pass with a 45 on a 60.

182
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,100
Crit failed.

183
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,820
Your other penis falls off.

184
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,180
Clark, we'll start with you this time.

185
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,180
You succeeded.

186
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,180
Mm-hmm.

187
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,260
So you're only going to lose one willpower right now?

188
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,340
Am I going to lose willpower because I have one willpower?

189
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,700
Does that mean I die?

190
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,980
Going to zero willpower doesn't mean that you die, but I will describe what happens

191
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,980
to you in just a second.

192
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:21,260
What's my distance from the front of John's car and what's my distance from the van?

193
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,420
You are one move action away from either.

194
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,220
Shit.

195
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,180
But is one closer?

196
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,180
They are equidistant.

197
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,180
Okay.

198
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,180
I'm going to go to the van.

199
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,180
Okay.

200
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,180
Sounds good.

201
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,020
You run up to the van.

202
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,300
Roll an alertness check for me.

203
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,300
Fuck.

204
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,300
A 90 on a 70.

205
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,300
Okay.

206
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,780
So you see two people in the front seats.

207
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:54,100
There's a woman driving and a young boy in the front seat.

208
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,100
Okay.

209
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,180
John, you failed your power check.

210
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,180
Yeah.

211
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,020
So I need you to roll a D4 for me.

212
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,020
What?

213
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,020
Okay.

214
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,860
So you lose one willpower in order to move this round.

215
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,860
I'm down to 10.

216
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,860
Yeah.

217
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,600
Just for the record, I'm down to six.

218
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,900
I would like to grab the fire extinguisher from my cruiser and attempt to put out the

219
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,740
fire on my engine.

220
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,900
Does it look extinguishable at this juncture?

221
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,020
Yes, absolutely.

222
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,740
So go ahead and roll law for me.

223
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,140
I got a 50-50 shot.

224
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,140
13.

225
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,780
Describe what you do.

226
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:32,300
Calmly and efficiently, like seeing Clark taking care of the civilians, I demonstrate

227
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,940
an excellent knowledge of law and procedure.

228
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,400
Go right to the compartment.

229
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:43,720
My extinguisher is locked in and calmly, but professionally and with the quickness, I put

230
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
the fire out.

231
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
Wonderful.

232
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,640
After you do that, you see Clark's cruiser begins to go up in flames.

233
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,320
The engine is smoking and you see flames licking out from underneath the hood.

234
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,400
I'm just going to Benny Hill style run between both cars.

235
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,200
So you've taken care of your cruiser.

236
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,840
Keith Vigna, you failed your power check in order to move.

237
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:10,120
I need you to roll a D4 for me, although it doesn't really matter.

238
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,120
One.

239
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,640
That means I'm at zero.

240
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,840
Keith has hit zero willpower.

241
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:22,240
Keith hops out of the side door of Clark's police cruiser and desperately looks around,

242
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,520
smelling the gas, seeing the oil, seeing the flames, seeing this minivan.

243
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,160
Your head begins spinning and you black out.

244
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:38,980
The two of you look over and see Officer Vigna, just eyes go blank and he falls backward onto

245
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:44,000
the ground right next to Clark's cruiser.

246
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And three.

247
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Fight!

248
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,720
I need John and Clark to roll power for me.

249
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,040
Oh, God damn it.

250
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
Sixty two on a sixty.

251
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
Thirty two on a sixty.

252
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
Okay.

253
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,480
Clark, you're going to lose one willpower and John, go ahead and roll a D4 for me.

254
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
Four.

255
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,720
John loses four willpower and Clark loses one.

256
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,720
I'm now at five.

257
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,720
I'm at six.

258
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
All right.

259
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,440
Clark, I need you to roll a luck check for me real quick.

260
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,080
Ah, fuck.

261
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,720
Uh, ninety on a seventy five.

262
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,720
Awesome.

263
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Fuck you.

264
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,760
That will come into play in just a second.

265
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,600
So John, what do you want to do this round?

266
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,240
I get, yeah, I want to try to extinguish the fire in on the other cruiser.

267
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,720
Is there enough juice left in the container or do I need to get theirs?

268
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,640
Why would you ask that?

269
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:48,640
I'll go ahead and let you, uh, by the way, this is a super important role and I'm going

270
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:55,360
to let you finish out the rest of this canister on their car, but I need you to roll law in

271
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,720
order to put it out.

272
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,360
Okay.

273
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,000
Forty.

274
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,520
Fuck you.

275
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,520
Well done.

276
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,520
Thank you.

277
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,520
Nice.

278
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,120
Once again, like fucking calmly as shit, John Lee Pettymore, who has lost a lot of willpower

279
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,680
and HP, like bleeding all over the extinguisher.

280
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,000
I just nailed that shit and save this family, the passed out Clark's, like all the converging

281
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,480
fluids you've been sending at us.

282
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,840
So you have had all the fluid that didn't combust.

283
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:33,840
So you have successfully, you have successfully stopped the combustion of the fluids of your

284
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,040
police cruiser as well as Clark's police cruiser.

285
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:44,760
Clark, you, you are crouched down at this minivan and the flames are growing taller

286
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:54,080
and taller coming out of the bottom of the front of this minivan and the smell is overwhelming.

287
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,640
What would you like to do with your turn?

288
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,040
Are either of the occupants conscious?

289
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,840
Roll first aid.

290
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,560
Oh, crit fail 77 on a 30.

291
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,560
They died on impact.

292
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:14,600
As far as you can tell, these aren't people at all, they're bears.

293
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,400
You would have absolutely no idea, but they might be beyond saving at this point.

294
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,920
They look pretty dead.

295
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,840
Save them anyway.

296
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,920
I assume I'm on the, actually I don't assume, what, what side am I on when I, when I walked

297
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
up to it?

298
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What side do you want to be on?

299
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,160
I guess I would prefer to be on the passenger side.

300
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,320
You are on the passenger side.

301
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,320
I break it.

302
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,320
I break in the window.

303
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,520
Go ahead and roll.

304
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,720
You can roll strength or law.

305
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,720
I'm rolling strength.

306
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,080
Uh, four on a 65.

307
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,080
Okay.

308
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:53,440
Good old smash it, uh, smash in the window and it's a kid you mentioned.

309
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
Yes.

310
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
It's a young boy.

311
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,520
I try to get up under kind of underneath him and hit his seatbelt and kind of catch him

312
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,320
as he falls and then pull, drag him out.

313
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,160
And as far away from the cars, I feel as a safe distance, but not too far away because

314
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,520
I'd like to try and go back for the driver.

315
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,520
Absolutely.

316
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:18,360
And as you pull him away from the car, the minivan explodes and I wouldn't say mushroom

317
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:26,160
cloud, but there is one of those wily coyote, like small ones, tiny wily coyote mushroom

318
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,120
cloud erupts from this minivan.

319
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,520
And the entire thing, I mean, this is loud.

320
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:42,900
The entire thing is up in flames and you guys just hear all this and you also hear the screaming

321
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,640
of a young girl.

322
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:54,640
I need the two of you who are still conscious to roll sanity, uh, 16, uh, 56 on a 37 fail.

323
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
Okay.

324
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:06,200
You are hearing the sounds of rubber popping and plastic melting and your stimuli are completely

325
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,160
overwhelmed and you don't, it just sounds like ringing in the ears to me.

326
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
Exactly.

327
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:21,680
And Clark, you absolutely know that there's someone screaming for help inside this burning

328
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,680
vehicle.

329
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,240
I need you to lose one sanity.

330
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,080
That puts me at 36 with a breaking point of 31.

331
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,680
Oh, you've got to drink when you're a sanity hits your age.

332
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
Is that how old you are?

333
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,680
I missed it.

334
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
No.

335
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,680
Oh, you got to drink twice.

336
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,680
Okay.

337
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,840
I keep forgetting you're younger than I am in the game.

338
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:52,280
You old motherfuckers is like eight months older than you or something.

339
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,120
I know it's like a year and a half, right?

340
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,400
You're 26, right?

341
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Yeah.

342
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
Luke is 17.

343
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,680
I'm almost 17.

344
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,080
New character voice.

345
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,800
I'm almost 17.

346
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,920
That's what Keith speaks like after the explosion.

347
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:16,600
I hit my head really hard when I passed out.

348
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:22,300
This is how Keith finds his character voice.

349
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,300
It's perfect.

350
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,660
Just a shitty Russell Brand.

351
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:35,900
I talk like, oh, from London, you talk like you're from London, from London, London, London.

352
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,820
I'm almost 17, I'm almost 17.

353
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,380
Sounds awful.

354
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,300
John, what do you do?

355
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,180
Can I do an awareness roll?

356
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,920
Well, I don't know how realistic that is.

357
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,860
Have I noticed Vigna lying there?

358
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,860
Yeah.

359
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,900
I just go over to him and try to resuscitate.

360
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,900
Okay.

361
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,900
Sounds good.

362
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,100
Go ahead and roll first aid for me.

363
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,100
Oh, wow.

364
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,100
This could go, yeah.

365
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,420
I don't have that.

366
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,740
What is your first aid?

367
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,140
The basic 10%.

368
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,140
Cool.

369
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,140
Good luck.

370
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,460
Which is exactly how confident I think I would feel as a real person in an emergency

371
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,460
situation.

372
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,740
There's like, okay, if I can wrap my shirt around it, then I've seen that in a movie.

373
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,740
Otherwise 33, crit fail.

374
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,740
Yeah.

375
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,740
I thought it was crit success.

376
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:24,140
You try to CPR me and you give me a heart attack.

377
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,140
Break your collarbone.

378
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,500
Also, what is the extent of, I'm not like cut up or anything.

379
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,500
I'm just-

380
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
No, you're just like unconscious, right?

381
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,820
Just passed out and probably hit my head.

382
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,820
You're probably bleeding from your face a little bit.

383
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,860
I'm trying to slap your face and maybe I like accidentally-

384
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,860
A little too hard.

385
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,860
Yeah.

386
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,860
Poke you really hard in the eye.

387
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,860
Yeah.

388
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,860
He lost the eye on the rack.

389
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,860
It was weird.

390
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:50,980
Jon, you run over to Keith to try to resuscitate him and as you're running over, you actually

391
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:59,460
trip and fall and your knee comes down right on Keith Vigna's nose.

392
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,440
Does it fall off like his penis?

393
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:10,540
You hear a crunch as your knee goes down onto his face, but you immediately catch yourself

394
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:17,620
and get up, but he is bleeding just way more profusely than he was before.

395
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,020
And Keith, I need you to roll, actually, you know what?

396
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,020
You did the damage.

397
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,620
Jon, go ahead and roll a-

398
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,620
Oh, no.

399
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,620
D4.

400
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,620
I'll really try not to.

401
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,620
One.

402
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,620
Ah.

403
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,620
Keith, you take one hit point of damage.

404
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:36,380
I only broke in as a little, just a little.

405
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,460
I am down to 18 hit points.

406
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,460
Clucks.

407
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,460
Your turn, what do you do?

408
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,780
I've got the kid over by the side.

409
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,980
Can I discern better if he's conscious or not?

410
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,400
Is he lucid at least?

411
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,980
Is he lucid or not lucid, I guess?

412
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,820
He is still very unconscious.

413
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,820
Okay.

414
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,780
Check for a pulse.

415
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,580
How engulfed is the van?

416
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,580
Holy.

417
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,540
I want to, yeah, I want to run over to the driver's side and just see if I can get close

418
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,140
enough to kick the window in.

419
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,140
Crit failure.

420
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,260
Kick her in the face while she's talking.

421
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,060
Okay, cool.

422
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,380
So I don't know, I don't know how to, you know, what do you guys-

423
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,820
Have you seen the movie Crash?

424
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,460
If it's, if it's, it won an Oscar, so.

425
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,080
So yeah, it's possible.

426
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,700
This episode will probably win the podcast if it won one of the Oscars.

427
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,700
I've seen all the best movies.

428
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,580
The worst episode of our podcast will win a, what does a podcast win?

429
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,580
A potty.

430
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,580
No, they have a name.

431
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,580
Anywho.

432
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,580
Blowy.

433
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,580
A blowy.

434
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,140
If you're saying it's so hot that no human could get close enough to do this, then just

435
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,700
say that I won't, I won't roll for it or anything.

436
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,420
You are more than welcome to do anything that you want.

437
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,060
But I just mean, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not physically there.

438
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:50,820
So if you picture it being so hot that it would deter me, I need to know that.

439
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,980
It will cause you damage if you go in there.

440
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,980
Okay.

441
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,980
I'm not going to do it.

442
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,980
I'm going to run back to the boy.

443
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,980
Okay.

444
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,300
And as a, as I'm running back to the boy, I'm going to go ahead and radio in to Drew

445
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,020
unless I have a direct line to paramedics.

446
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,300
Oh, you absolutely do.

447
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,940
We need emergency services up here.

448
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,140
We've got some hurt people.

449
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,260
We're just up the road from the clinic.

450
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,260
Send ambulances.

451
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,260
The clinic.

452
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,900
And then I want to try and first aid the kid.

453
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,900
Okay.

454
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,900
Go ahead and roll first aid for me.

455
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,900
Fuck.

456
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,540
A 72 on a 30.

457
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:26,500
He is still very unconscious and his breathing begins to slow.

458
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,740
I'm going to have you go ahead and roll luck for me.

459
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,740
Fail.

460
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,020
93 on a 75.

461
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,100
You chip over him and break his nose.

462
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,100
Also.

463
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,100
Yeah.

464
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,260
That's all of my fails from here on out.

465
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:46,940
You tripping fall on someone and it hurts him real bad fucking idiot fail on hacking

466
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,100
that computer.

467
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,620
You trip over it and break your nose.

468
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,340
A broken nose is my favorite thing to do in a role playing game.

469
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,620
Just in case you can get people to talk like this.

470
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,260
Is that how you're going to give him this character?

471
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:09,140
I was hoping that Luke might have the new broken nose character voice.

472
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:13,180
It's funny because when we started, he thought about holding his gun to do this the whole

473
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:17,460
time and I'm so glad I did not do that.

474
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,460
Okay.

475
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,860
So after that very funny exchange, you see this boy begin to die.

476
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:28,140
As the ambulances arrive on the scene, two paramedics hop out immediately.

477
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,340
One of them comes over, comes up to you, Clark, cause you have the boy.

478
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,660
Hey man, what happened here?

479
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,660
I don't, I don't, I don't know.

480
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:40,140
It's all I'm a, it was an accident.

481
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,620
They went off the road.

482
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,020
I don't, I don't think he's doing so good.

483
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,020
Okay.

484
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:49,380
So they are loading him up on the stretcher as you're, as you're telling them this and

485
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,000
they get the boy into the ambulance.

486
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,220
The fire truck arrives and firemen hop out and begin putting out the flames on this minivan.

487
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,220
What are you guys doing?

488
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:04,700
Well, I want to send one of a paramedic after Keith and then I want to go investigate the

489
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,580
body on the hood of my car.

490
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,780
I want to talk to a fireman or more like yell.

491
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,900
There was, there was somebody in the driver's seat.

492
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,900
They were screaming there.

493
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:17,620
I don't think they're, I think they're, I think they're dead, but if we can get in there.

494
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,100
Calm down officer.

495
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,100
We're on it.

496
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,100
Oh God.

497
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,340
You guys remember 9-11 fucking firemen?

498
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:28,140
Sorry if my voice is really weird, but I'm really hoarse from a three day bachelor party.

499
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,180
I'm really horny from a three day bachelor party.

500
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,060
I'm a horse from a three day bachelor party.

501
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,060
Ooh.

502
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,060
Naaay.

503
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,060
Edited that out.

504
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,060
Um.

505
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,100
Do not edit what he's saying.

506
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,660
I'm a horse from a three day bachelor party out.

507
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,940
That's so good.

508
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:49,060
So as soon as they get the young boy up into the ambulance, they pull another stretcher

509
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,660
out, get Keith on it, get him into an ambulance.

510
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,660
Amber lamps.

511
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:58,580
One, you would see them take Keith away on a stretcher as you walk over to the front

512
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:06,700
of your police cruiser, which is completely covered in fire foam or fire foam, the detritus

513
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,020
of a fire machine.

514
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,020
Oh God.

515
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,020
I can't.

516
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,020
Oh, that was so adorable.

517
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:16,260
I was trying to do a fireball, but my voice can't get up there.

518
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,260
Anyway.

519
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:22,580
Do it again.

520
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,580
Fire foam.

521
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:32,820
So as you go up, you see this body that fell from the sky like an angel on his back into

522
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,820
the cruiser.

523
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:42,100
And when you walk around, you see him and you kind of move some of the foam away from

524
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,140
his face.

525
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:51,380
And he is a short balding man with large eyes and a tiny nose.

526
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:56,300
And he has fool seared into his forehead with a brand.

527
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,860
I shout over to, uh, to Clark.

528
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,660
Hey Clark, I think we found John Peters.

529
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:29,660
Keith, you were looking at all of this chaos around you and your mind just couldn't handle

530
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:35,260
it and your body just shuts down and everything goes black.

531
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:41,940
You wake up in bed, it's Christmas morning and you hear the faint sounds of laughter

532
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,660
coming from downstairs.

533
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:49,540
I rub my eyes and I get out of bed and I, I look around and I realize I went to bed

534
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:55,180
early last night so that Santa Claus could come bring me some gifts.

535
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,560
So I immediately realized that it's Christmas day.

536
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:05,300
So I excitedly run down the stairs and I see my entire family, my mom, my dad, my brother

537
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,100
Ferguson, all sitting around a bunch of gifts.

538
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:12,180
Half of them are already open and they all turn their heads at me.

539
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:19,740
My mom goes, oh, I guess we forgot to wake up Keith and they all laugh.

540
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:26,220
And I, and you actually, you hear your father chortles and says, yes, that's right.

541
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,220
We forgot.

542
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:34,500
I pretend like I didn't hear that and I sit down, uh, directly across from my brother

543
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,500
Ferguson.

544
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,660
I say, Hey, what, what have you gotten already?

545
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:41,960
Ferguson just stares at you with a blank expression.

546
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,020
His eyes have looked different ever since your dad gave him that watch.

547
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:51,980
William, your father says, we got Ferguson some games that will help him train for his

548
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,060
path.

549
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,060
That's cool.

550
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,580
Maybe once you beat the games, I can play them.

551
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,940
Well, they aren't really for you.

552
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,260
Can I, I can watch you play them.

553
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,260
Perhaps.

554
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,260
Okay.

555
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,580
Well, Hey, Hey dad.

556
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,260
I get, where's my presence at?

557
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:15,500
Your mom, without breaking her smiling eye contact with your father, points to a box

558
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:19,740
on the other side of the room, like, okay, is it my turn to open it yet?

559
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:25,500
In unison, your parents say, no, as they push another present toward Ferguson.

560
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,500
Okay.

561
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,580
Uh, Hey Fergie, I'm excited to see what you got.

562
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,060
Can I help you open it?

563
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:37,740
Ferguson looks to your parents, both of them, sternly shaking their heads and his eyes begin

564
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,220
to tear up as he opens his present.

565
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,100
What did you want more than anything else for Christmas this year?

566
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:50,020
I wanted the pro players extended pack of Pokemon cards with all the holograms that

567
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:56,820
had all of the rare cards and super rare and all the shiny ones you see Fergie open up

568
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:03,260
this present and it's all these Pokemon cards that you desperately wanted and kept asking

569
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:07,820
for and dropping hints for the past couple months that this is what you wanted.

570
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:13,680
And Fergie looks up with these begging eyes as your father says, do it.

571
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:19,280
And Ferguson shuts his eyes tight, a single tear running down each cheek as he picks up

572
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:27,120
his Christmas hot cocoa and pours it all into the box filled with these cards of pocket

573
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,400
monsters.

574
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:34,440
I start crying immediately and then I don't, I don't even ask.

575
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:42,520
I just rip open my gift expecting to see more Pokemon cards, but I open it up and it's a

576
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:49,660
white box, one that I've recognized from years prior from Christmases past and I knew that

577
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:53,300
it contained just clothes.

578
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,260
It's just a clothes box.

579
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:59,600
And when you open it, it is a brand new jacket.

580
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,820
Something you're not accustomed to since you are typically the recipient of Ferguson's

581
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,020
hand-me-downs.

582
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:10,600
And it is exactly the style of jacket all the young boys are envious of at this time.

583
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,480
My immediate disappointment turns into pure excitement and I look at my father and my

584
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:22,240
mother and a tear is rolling out of my eye and I say, thank you so much.

585
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,180
And I put it on and it droops over you.

586
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:29,640
It is, the sleeves go past my hands.

587
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,680
It is at least two sizes too big.

588
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:36,240
And I look at him and I'm like, well we can take it back and exchange it for my size.

589
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,480
And your parents are staring at Ferguson.

590
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,280
He begins sobbing uncontrollably as he walks toward you.

591
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,900
Your father barks, emotion is weakness.

592
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,920
You need to be strong.

593
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,920
Take what is yours.

594
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,280
It's the only way to succeed.

595
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:03,360
Ferguson beans, wipes his tears away and takes the jacket from off your back, putting it

596
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,860
on and turning away from you.

597
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:11,540
It looks really cool on you, Ferguson.

598
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:16,900
And you wake up in the back of this ambulance, what are they called?

599
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,900
Ambulance people.

600
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,900
EMT.

601
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,900
The EMT.

602
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,900
Paramedic.

603
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,700
Oh, hey, you're back.

604
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,700
How are you feeling?

605
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,700
What?

606
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,700
What?

607
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,700
Ah.

608
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:32,660
And your nose is just super broken and you got blood splattered all over your chest.

609
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,900
Oh, hey, we can give you something for that.

610
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:41,580
He hands you a bunch of pills and you take them, I'm guessing.

611
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,580
Oh yeah.

612
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,460
Alright, so we're going to put you back up at one willpower.

613
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,580
So you're still at a negative twenty percent.

614
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:53,900
Go ahead and roll a D4 for me as he begins doing first aid on you.

615
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,900
Dose.

616
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,900
So you gain two hit points back.

617
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,900
Cool.

618
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,800
That puts me back up to twenty, I believe.

619
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,220
Do you think you can stand up?

620
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,700
How are you feeling?

621
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,780
Yeah, I think, I mean, my face just hurts.

622
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:10,860
It feels a lot better after that, thank you, but, you know, I think I just, I just took

623
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:15,380
a, I smelled some of that gas and stuff, it just kind of got to my head, but I, help me

624
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,020
up and let me see if I can.

625
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,180
Okay, for sure.

626
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:24,020
And he helps you up and he kicks over in the back of the ambulance and the scene is still

627
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,020
out there.

628
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:29,620
There, it's, I mean, it's not chaos anymore, but there are people running around all over

629
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,300
the place, taking care of business.

630
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:35,600
The fire has been put out, they're getting information, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

631
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,700
You see John and Clark standing on the other side of John's cruiser, just ahead of you,

632
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,620
and you walk out of the back of the ambulance.

633
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,620
Cool.

634
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,620
What?

635
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,620
Whoop-de-de-scoop.

636
00:33:46,620 --> 00:34:05,740
God damn it, I was, I almost put this through your eye, holding a mechanical pencil.

637
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,500
He's holding a mechanical pencil.

638
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:12,020
For the listeners, Thomas is holding a mechanical pencil that he threatened the life of Luke

639
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,020
with.

640
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,020
No, just the eye.

641
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,420
That's like my depth perception.

642
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,420
What's behind your eye?

643
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,420
Luke, you would look really cool.

644
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,420
Your brain.

645
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,420
No, I don't think I'd look cool with an eye patch.

646
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:29,120
I would have a fake eye, but I would get like an eight ball, no, a magic eight ball.

647
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,580
And when I like shook my head, I could, you know, answer your questions for you.

648
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,580
That's really good.

649
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:41,820
Okay, so John and, John and Clark are standing in front of John's police cruiser and you've

650
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,620
just had this revelation about who the body is.

651
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:49,940
When you guys look up and you see Keith Vigness stumbling out of the back of the ambulance.

652
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,940
Wow.

653
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,940
Hey, you guys.

654
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:58,060
You guys were in the slum room for a long time.

655
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:02,540
Just to set up that joke.

656
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:08,380
Real fast though, I did want to watch and see if the body of the driver came out of

657
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,860
the car before I was going to go over to John.

658
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,340
They haven't pulled anything out yet.

659
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,340
Okay.

660
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,860
Then yeah, I'll walk over to John and I now see that it's John Peters.

661
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,860
You do.

662
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,700
And you said fool was on his head.

663
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,700
Correct.

664
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:25,100
And that was from, we saw that when he was in the stock stocks in a picture that came

665
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,100
from the camera.

666
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,820
I'd like to feel for a pulse.

667
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,380
Roll first aid.

668
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,380
Fuck.

669
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,960
A 37 on a 30.

670
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,580
You feel no pulse.

671
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,460
Also, you killed him.

672
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,340
Good job, dude.

673
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,620
He is one with the vehicle.

674
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,180
He fell on his back.

675
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,180
He fell on his back.

676
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,020
Like his FAQ.

677
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,020
His FAQ back?

678
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,700
His FAQ bell in first.

679
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:54,820
So you would clearly see, well, it's not out of the ordinary for you to try to find a pulse,

680
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,100
but this body is extremely dead from what you can tell.

681
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,460
I want to look up in the sky.

682
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,100
Do I see any remnants of the stuff we saw earlier?

683
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,100
No.

684
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,740
Also, we were all in the room when it was being recorded, but John is the only one who

685
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,220
saw the body fall from the sky.

686
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,220
Oh really?

687
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,180
And all the stuff happened like around the sky.

688
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,380
I don't, I don't look up then.

689
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:18,220
Hopefully, John says, did you, did you see where this came from?

690
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:24,380
I mean, he must've been standing in the road when he fell from the sky.

691
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:30,620
I look up, you see a giant swirl.

692
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,900
Did you not see the clouds go crazy?

693
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,900
The clouds go crazy.

694
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:39,220
They were swirling all around and a technicolor light was coming from.

695
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,260
And then this motherfucker right here just fell on the head of my car.

696
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,780
I didn't, I didn't see any of that, John.

697
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,780
Can you feel my forehead?

698
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,780
Fuck.

699
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,780
I feel his forehead.

700
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,780
It's wet.

701
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,780
It's wet.

702
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,780
Warm, wet, or cold wet?

703
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,780
Warm, wet.

704
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,780
Warm, wet.

705
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,780
I'm not seeing things though, buddy.

706
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,780
I saw this.

707
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,420
I mean, I'm not, I'm not going to discount it just because of all the stuff we've seen,

708
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,060
but I didn't see it, my man.

709
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,060
Okay.

710
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:06,300
I'm just coming up and just now I'm noticing John Peter's body on the hood of your car,

711
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,300
in the hood of your car.

712
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,900
I, uh, I pat him on the shoulder.

713
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,900
Keith, you all right?

714
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,900
Oh, that hurts.

715
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,900
Please don't do that.

716
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,900
Ooh.

717
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,900
Ooh.

718
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,900
I'm very sore.

719
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,900
What, uh, what got you?

720
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:21,080
Oh, just a car wreck and passing out and hitting my head and, uh, I don't know how my nose

721
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:26,140
got broken, but somehow I fell on the back of my head and ended up with a broken nose.

722
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,180
So I assumed the airbag, right?

723
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,460
Oh man, so much stuff was flying around.

724
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,460
Who can tell really?

725
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,460
Oh yeah.

726
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,460
It's, it's weird.

727
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,780
I thought this would have maybe changed the way you talk or something.

728
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:45,300
I decided against doing that cause it's, it would be annoying for me to have to do.

729
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,100
Also I did it once and then immediately forgot to do it and I don't want to have to.

730
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,700
I don't want to have to go do that again.

731
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,020
Looking at you, are you bandaged?

732
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,600
Yeah, I'm bandaged up.

733
00:37:54,600 --> 00:38:00,260
They gave me some medication so that I could just like stand talking and standing and walk

734
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,260
and stuff.

735
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:05,000
So I'm feeling beat up, but you know, definitely worse for wear.

736
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,620
But also I'm able to, yeah, like not feeling good.

737
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:13,400
So I go up to the body and I look down at it and I look up at both of you guys.

738
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,480
I'm like, wait, do you know who this is?

739
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,360
Who do you think it is?

740
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,360
Do you know who this is?

741
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,360
Who do you think it is?

742
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,800
Wait, would I not know who it is?

743
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,800
I would though, right?

744
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,840
I'm no fool, but I think this is John Peters.

745
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,600
And he moonwalks out of the scene.

746
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,920
We'll make a cop of this boy, yeah.

747
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,240
That's what a fool believes.

748
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,680
He puts his sunglasses on and you hear a scream from a distance.

749
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:52,600
I put my sunglasses on and then I take them off.

750
00:38:52,600 --> 00:39:01,720
I want to get out my phone and take a picture, take a bunch of pictures even of this whole

751
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,720
scene.

752
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,720
Okay.

753
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,720
I need you all to roll sanity for me for this body being John Peters.

754
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,520
I say, hey Clark, is that for your spank bank?

755
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,520
I failed this.

756
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,520
I failed it too.

757
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,520
I failed it hard.

758
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,680
I don't even know what we're rolling for, but I definitely failed.

759
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,680
Sanity.

760
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,680
Yep.

761
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,680
71 on a 31.

762
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,680
And a 95.

763
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,680
63 on a 36.

764
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:31,560
For our fucking nerd listeners, who are all, for those of you who might be fucking nerds.

765
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,480
Likely all of you.

766
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,480
Roll a D4.

767
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,480
That's how much you each lose.

768
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,480
Yay.

769
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,480
Got that out.

770
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,480
One.

771
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,480
Fuck.

772
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,480
Four.

773
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,480
This was sanity?

774
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,480
Correct.

775
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,120
I am at sanity 32 with my breaking point at 31.

776
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:52,840
Clark lost four sanity, Keith lost four sanity, and John lost one sanity.

777
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,120
I don't remember if we talked about this.

778
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,280
I hit my breaking point last time.

779
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:01,800
Did we decide on something to go along with my other disorder?

780
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,960
We are going to worry about the disorders.

781
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,320
Once your psyche's really had time to stew on what fucked it up.

782
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,320
Exactly.

783
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,320
Gotcha.

784
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,320
Gotcha.

785
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,320
Gotcha.

786
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,320
Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.

787
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,320
What?

788
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,320
Got him.

789
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,320
Got him.

790
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,400
He got me pretty good.

791
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,720
That was a, dude, burn.

792
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,560
What kind of clothes is John Peters wearing?

793
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:35,240
John Peters is wearing a pair of jeans and a button down shirt.

794
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,240
Are they cool jeans?

795
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,240
No.

796
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,280
Am I able to get to his pockets?

797
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,280
Yes.

798
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,280
Hold on.

799
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:50,040
Luke just actually broke his nose on the mic.

800
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,400
Oh, this hurts really bad.

801
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,480
We'll get you that character voice.

802
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,600
If we have to break your nose for real, we'll get you that character voice.

803
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,480
I'm method acting for this podcast.

804
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,520
Luke just slammed his face into the wall.

805
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,920
To all 30, to all 30 listeners.

806
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,920
What would Leto do?

807
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,920
What would Leto do?

808
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,600
He just slammed his face.

809
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,000
I would like to search John Peters pockets.

810
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,200
Get police instincts.

811
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,920
They're full of cum.

812
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,920
You reach in.

813
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,920
Ew, it's cum, guys.

814
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,920
Oh, let me double check.

815
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,520
Yep, that's cum.

816
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,520
Give me some.

817
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,080
Keith, taste it.

818
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,800
Oh, he needs to change his diet.

819
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,600
There's nothing in his pockets.

820
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
Sorry.

821
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
Except cum.

822
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:50,360
He's a masochist and a skydiver.

823
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,840
I hope that makes it on.

824
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,040
It probably won't.

825
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,800
I crit success staying in the podcast.

826
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,760
You search John Peters' pockets and you don't find anything inside them.

827
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,760
Sorry.

828
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,760
Cummer.

829
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,160
I wish I could give you something here.

830
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,880
It just doesn't make any sense for him to have anything on him.

831
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:16,920
I was like, I wonder if you keep your wallet once you've transported to the goo plane.

832
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,920
Can I do a...

833
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,920
Wait, do I have forensics?

834
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,920
Okay, yeah.

835
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,200
I'm going to do a forensics roll to see how he died.

836
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,200
I think it was blunt trauma.

837
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,200
Hell yeah.

838
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,440
Wait, can we do that again?

839
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,000
Can we get a tight hell yeah on that?

840
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,100
This feels shitty, but yeah.

841
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,800
Can I do a roll to see if I can tell how he died?

842
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,800
Hell yeah.

843
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
All right.

844
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,800
Let's try to fight against...

845
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,800
Yeah.

846
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,800
He did pass his roll though.

847
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,800
How did he die?

848
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,800
Yeah, he did.

849
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,800
He did nail it.

850
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,800
It was 17 for that first roll.

851
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,800
Oh, was it?

852
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,800
Okay, cool.

853
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,800
Yeah, I have a zero in forensics though.

854
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,800
Oh, really?

855
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,800
Oh, fuck.

856
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,800
Oh, shit.

857
00:42:53,800 --> 00:43:05,720
Yeah, I was just going to say that I pass it no matter what.

858
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,720
So an unusable bit.

859
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:16,040
Okay, so as you guys are standing around looking at the body in John's cruiser, you

860
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:23,680
see the firemen are pulling a woman's charred remains from the driver's seat of the minivan.

861
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,680
Is she hot?

862
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:29,460
Oh, she was.

863
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:34,280
Then you see two more firefighters and they're going into the back of the van.

864
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,280
Don't pull out a dog.

865
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,200
Pull out a kid, not a dog.

866
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,840
They pull out the body of a small girl.

867
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,440
Oh, we should have been a dog.

868
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,600
Go ahead and roll sanity for me.

869
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,600
Pass.

870
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,600
Fail.

871
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,600
42 on a 30.

872
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,600
The crit failed.

873
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,400
I rolled 100.

874
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,400
It was your daughter.

875
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,280
This is going to stack nicely with...

876
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,600
Hey, remember how smoothly the first half of this went?

877
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:08,360
So John, you lose one sanity, Clark, you lose two sanity, and Keith, you lose no sanity.

878
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,600
That makes me hit my breaking point.

879
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,640
32 now, I'm at 30 with a breaking point of 31.

880
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,640
How do I recalculate that again?

881
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,640
I always forget.

882
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,800
So you're at 30 now, and so you subtract your power, which is 12.

883
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,620
From that breaking point, right?

884
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,800
From your current sanity.

885
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,800
Oh, okay.

886
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,680
So if you go past your breaking point, it starts over from where your sanity is currently.

887
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,680
Gotcha, cool.

888
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,800
We all know is 18, and I didn't use my calculator for that.

889
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,920
Joe, I'm bad at math, and that one's a little sad.

890
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,520
The only reason I didn't lose sanity is because I am a terrible police officer, and I was

891
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,520
not paying attention at all.

892
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,520
Perfect.

893
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:50,400
You're trying to figure out how to pick your nose in a nose cast?

894
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,040
No, they popped my nose back into place and said, don't let your coworkers fall on you.

895
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,920
What if they put one of those clear masks over your face?

896
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,600
It's like when you have to play basketball, yeah, yeah.

897
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,600
Perfect.

898
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:11,200
Because I was too busy messing with the clear face mask they put over me to not break my

899
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,880
nose.

900
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,840
The cone that they put on me, dog.

901
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:24,960
What if they gave you a gun on both of his hands so that he can't scratch his face?

902
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,320
I'm wearing the clear face mask and cones over my nose.

903
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,320
No.

904
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,520
We're turning him into a monster.

905
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,520
Too funny.

906
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,520
Oh, man.

907
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,840
No, just ridiculous.

908
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:40,800
I'm guessing that you are going to need- We're going to need new cars.

909
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,800
New cars.

910
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,360
Good thing we're not out of town yet.

911
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,600
Thankfully, Keith's Cruiser is still at the police department.

912
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,600
True that.

913
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,720
Let's call Drew and have it bring it to us.

914
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,720
Grab it.

915
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,160
Bring it to us.

916
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,160
We respect you, Drew.

917
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,000
I put a lot of emotion into that character.

918
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,080
You can't just call him an it.

919
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,880
Have the fang bring us.

920
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,880
Also, the Chief's Cruiser is still feasible, so we could just steal hers.

921
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,360
She's not going to be using it.

922
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,240
Yeah, stealing's an interesting way to put it.

923
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,240
Well, not steal.

924
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,240
Utilize.

925
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,240
We can certainly utilize.

926
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,840
It's still police department property.

927
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:21,280
When we call Drew, can we also have him get a tow truck and bring in our cruisers and

928
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,000
maybe start working on fixing them bad boys back in shape?

929
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,760
Well, we could also, instead of this mill thing, we could just go to the cruiser store.

930
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,360
Wait, also, didn't we fix the four wheeler?

931
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,360
That is true.

932
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,840
Drew did fix the four wheeler.

933
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,900
I want to drive the four wheeler.

934
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:36,900
Around town?

935
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,120
I mean, following you guys.

936
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,400
We're going to be on the highway and stuff, man.

937
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,720
I'll attach a rope to the front of my four wheeler.

938
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,720
Put it in neutral.

939
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,720
Put it in neutral.

940
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,720
Have you?

941
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,520
No, Keith, you're going to have to ride with us.

942
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,520
I'm sorry.

943
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,520
Yeah, good, because my drive is-

944
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,880
Hey buddy, we'll have more four wheel adventures real soon.

945
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,880
Okay.

946
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,800
Should we do anything more with John Peters?

947
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,360
I feel like there's a lot more we need to do.

948
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,840
Autopsy, for sure.

949
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,840
Just get a coroner out there?

950
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,360
I mean, send him to the coroner.

951
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,240
Yeah, if we take him to the coroner.

952
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,000
Load him up in the tow truck.

953
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,040
So the coroner isn't counting.

954
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,160
Is that where the cruiser repair shop is too?

955
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:19,600
No, you guys, there's a place in town that Drew will have your cruisers towed to.

956
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:24,680
What if we send John Peters to the repair shop and see what they can do?

957
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,720
Work your magic, boys.

958
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,540
Bit of a special request this time.

959
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:33,480
You did say he was part of the car now.

960
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,280
Man, they're going to overcharge you for those.

961
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,540
Oh, that's true.

962
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,540
We are going to have to like, yeah.

963
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,540
Yeah, put it on our tab.

964
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,560
He's going to need some extraction.

965
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,560
It's a lot of body work.

966
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,560
Hey!

967
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,560
Hell yeah.

968
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:53,880
Podcast over.

969
00:47:53,880 --> 00:48:02,880
This has been pretending to be people with Zach Thomas, Luke, and our star, Joe Terry.

970
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,000
Thank you.

971
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,920
Thank you.

972
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,060
Okay.

973
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:10,060
And then let's have the cruisers towed.

974
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:12,640
We can ride with the tow truck back to...

975
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,000
Or we could have Drew drive the cruiser to us.

976
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,200
And then he could ride with the tow truck back.

977
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,200
That's true.

978
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,960
Also, the tow tump...

979
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,600
The tow truck company is called Towed Truck and they just have a towed logo.

980
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,600
Oh, of course.

981
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,600
Love it.

982
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,600
I like it.

983
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,800
And the frog has huge toes.

984
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,200
Yeah, that's why it's a toad.

985
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:34,120
Anyway, so yeah, he brings the cruiser up here.

986
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,680
We all hop in my cruiser.

987
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:41,160
And then, well, I would say we would go to the mill, but do you want to push us in a

988
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,880
certain direction?

989
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:49,240
Ouch, and yes.

990
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:54,720
So Drew comes rolling up in Keith Vigna's police cruiser.

991
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:01,480
He gets out and he looks at all three of you suspiciously and he says...

992
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,480
It's pronounced specifically.

993
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,480
One, two, three.

994
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,480
Bubble gum tree.

995
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,480
Bubble gum tree.

996
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,480
Bubble gum tree.

997
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,960
Let's try that one more time.

998
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,160
I forgot what it actually was.

999
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,160
Bubble gum tree.

1000
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,000
Okay, I think we're good.

1001
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
What happened here?

1002
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,120
I mean, you don't have to tell me now.

1003
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:23,480
I'll see the paperwork later when I fill it out, but that, I mean, this looks crazy.

1004
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:28,760
Well, John Peters fell out of the sky causing me to lose control of my patrol vehicle, which

1005
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,620
careened across the highway into oncoming traffic.

1006
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:35,800
And because of that, two civilians are dead and another is seriously injured and Keith's

1007
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,760
penis fell off and he broke his nose.

1008
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,120
For the record, my penis is still attached.

1009
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,600
Oh, they got that back on.

1010
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,600
I don't know.

1011
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,600
That was a weird joke to make.

1012
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,320
It kind of makes me mad since...

1013
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,640
You were screaming and my penis fell off.

1014
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,640
I don't know.

1015
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,640
I probably have a concussion.

1016
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,640
I don't know.

1017
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,640
That might make sense.

1018
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,800
Keith, is your penis okay?

1019
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,080
I unbuckle my big britches.

1020
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:05,120
I unbuckle my big britches, open them up about a foot past my stomach and I look at it and

1021
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,760
I'm like, yep, it's on there.

1022
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,760
Okay, thank goodness.

1023
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:14,840
Okay, so guys, I hate to do this, but I just got a call from the estate salesman and he's

1024
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:23,840
at James's house and he found some unsettling writing in blood and many guns after accidentally

1025
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,520
triggering some sort of secret door-like trap.

1026
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:32,560
So he's wondering if he can sell the guns in the estate sale.

1027
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:38,040
I told him probably not, but that you guys would go over and check it out because it

1028
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:42,560
seems like it might be a crime scene, what with the weird blood writing and such.

1029
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,160
Who was James?

1030
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,160
He was the waiter guy.

1031
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,160
He said see you later guy.

1032
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,160
That's what I thought.

1033
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,160
Yeah.

1034
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,800
He wasn't good enough for us.

1035
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:57,560
Also, he had his foot missing in the explosion radio and he was also the guy with the vacuum.

1036
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,540
Wait, was James the one over the table?

1037
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,900
He was the one hunched over the table, foot missing.

1038
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,140
Also the guy with the vacuum in the neighborhood.

1039
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:07,540
And was he eating a plate of foot?

1040
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:12,660
He had a plate of foot in front of him, but we don't know if he was eating it.

1041
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:13,660
Oh yeah.

1042
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,180
Have we ever had the coroners looked at if those feet matched?

1043
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,700
Well, they blew up.

1044
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,700
Remember?

1045
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,700
Oh, man.

1046
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,700
Okay.

1047
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:21,700
Again, Joe fucking up.

1048
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,980
But back at that house, you walked in and it was Maggie?

1049
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:29,300
Maggie was dead, stabbed in the face to death with a foot missing.

1050
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:36,340
James slumped at the table with the foot meat or whatever, shot in the head, his foot missing.

1051
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,340
Holding a gun.

1052
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:38,340
Holding a gun.

1053
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,340
And a fork.

1054
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:45,980
Drew passed out and the Harold Dorsey of what'sbehinddorsey.tumblr.com.

1055
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,160
By the way guys, I know who did it.

1056
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,160
Don't tell us.

1057
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,160
We got to figure it out.

1058
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,160
Don't tell us.

1059
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:54,380
A guy with a scar over his eye and a gun.

1060
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:57,960
An overweight guy wearing all black with a scar over his eye.

1061
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,520
And we have not seen that guy since.

1062
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,520
No.

1063
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,520
Correct.

1064
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,520
Okay.

1065
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,520
That's what I was trying to remember.

1066
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,520
Okay.

1067
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:08,480
After Drew says all that, he kind of looks at John Lee Pettymore.

1068
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,920
Hey, can we talk for a minute right now?

1069
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,280
Yeah, it'd probably be best.

1070
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,280
Okay, sure.

1071
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,280
Yeah.

1072
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,280
What's up, buddy?

1073
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,040
And so he kind of pulls you over to the side of the road, maybe off the ditch in the side

1074
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,040
of the road.

1075
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,040
Do you guys want to head out?

1076
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:28,960
Hey, John.

1077
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:29,960
Yeah, buddy.

1078
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,960
What's up?

1079
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,960
Hey.

1080
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,680
So, um, I got a message from the Duke.

1081
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,680
Oh yeah.

1082
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:35,920
What is, what's it say?

1083
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,640
The deal is going down tonight.

1084
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,920
Well, what time?

1085
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,400
Uh, 2am.

1086
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,560
Whatever, whoever sent it to me said the location will be sent later tonight.

1087
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,560
All right.

1088
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,840
I just wanted to give you a heads up, obviously, and not really text about it like we talked

1089
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,840
about before.

1090
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:55,520
Man, you've got great, I had to say this, consider it a lot of work, but great.

1091
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,520
Criminal instincts.

1092
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,520
Thank you.

1093
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,080
I have to think I learned quickly.

1094
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:03,280
You know, also, around here, this is just more general rascalism than actually criminal.

1095
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,280
Oh.

1096
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,280
That's the way the Pettimores look at it.

1097
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,280
Absolutely.

1098
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,400
No, I mean, if we didn't sell these drugs, someone else would.

1099
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,480
All right, I need, I want you to try something.

1100
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,480
Okay.

1101
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,880
And if you can pull this off, I'll give you 5% of my share.

1102
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:16,880
Okay.

1103
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:17,880
All right.

1104
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,880
I want you to try to negotiate with the Duke and say, hey man, we're the ones with the

1105
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,280
drugs.

1106
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:26,880
We picked the location and I wanted to come out to my farm where we got the drugs buried.

1107
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,240
Okay.

1108
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,240
Sounds good.

1109
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,240
You're a good man.

1110
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,240
That's perfect.

1111
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,240
What should we say we were talking about?

1112
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,240
Um.

1113
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,240
I'll wing it.

1114
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,240
I'll figure it out.

1115
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,240
Okay.

1116
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,240
Sounds good.

1117
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:49,360
Keith and Clark, what are you guys talking about when John and Drew go walk off into

1118
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,360
the ditch?

1119
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,360
Hey, dude.

1120
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,040
I know, like, I'm really sore.

1121
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:59,640
I remember not losing consciousness in the car and my nose definitely wasn't broken.

1122
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,200
Like how, how did that happen?

1123
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,400
Oh, I mean, we, we slammed into the back of John's pretty fucking hard.

1124
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,080
I remember that, but I remember crawling out of the window with my nose intact.

1125
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,080
I don't remember that.

1126
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,080
My man.

1127
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,080
Can I do a human on?

1128
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:16,160
Well, hey, Clark didn't actually see this, but I like that you think this is going to

1129
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,440
somehow possibly make up at all.

1130
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,280
Like meet me on the same level as trashing my house.

1131
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,520
That's really exactly what I'm going for.

1132
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,520
Yeah.

1133
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,520
Not going to work.

1134
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,520
He's probably going to break it again.

1135
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:35,840
No, uh, Keith, I heard you smash out the window, but I was, I was occupied trying to get myself

1136
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,320
out of my side.

1137
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,800
I don't, I don't know what happened.

1138
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:39,800
Hey.

1139
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,000
Well also they told me that you saved that kid.

1140
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
So good on you for that.

1141
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
That was good.

1142
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,920
I just, I just jumped, you know, I mean, it's a shame you couldn't save the other people,

1143
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,360
but I don't think that's on you.

1144
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:52,960
And I put my arm around Clark and I comfort him just a little bit.

1145
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,600
I think I'll be hearing those screams for a while though.

1146
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:02,700
I'm glad I was unconscious for it because that would fuck me up.

1147
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:07,720
As you guys are finishing up this conversation, Drew and John walk back toward you.

1148
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:13,200
So as, as I walk up, I like slap a big hand on Keith's back and I'm like, Hey man, really

1149
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,480
sorry about the nose.

1150
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:19,040
I was rushing over, trying to give you some existence and I, uh, I tripped on your big

1151
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,040
pants and kind of need you right in the face there.

1152
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,200
I'm really sorry about that, buddy, but you know, I, I didn't mean anything by it.

1153
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,760
You know, just the, the, it's the thought that counts.

1154
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,640
So I, you know, I appreciate you trying to help me cause I know I can't do anything to

1155
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:33,640
hurt me.

1156
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,640
Yeah.

1157
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:39,040
I know that I was about to say like, you know, I'm a, I don't know if I would have done the

1158
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,080
same thing for you.

1159
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,840
Not out of spite, but out of pure fear.

1160
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,080
I mean, yeah, I would have definitely helped you too.

1161
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,080
Sorry.

1162
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,080
Forget.

1163
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,080
I said anything.

1164
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,080
Thank you for breaking my nose.

1165
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,640
Uh, John isn't like thinking about your faux pas.

1166
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,600
He's just like, did Keith call me brave?

1167
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,760
Yeah.

1168
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:02,240
As you guys are having this conversation, Drew says, Oh my, Oh my God, what is that?

1169
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:09,400
And you guys see an extremely wet black cat running toward you from the water.

1170
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:19,080
And the extremely wet black cat jumps up onto your leg, John, and it's like,

1171
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:22,560
I bring him up to my face and I say, hold on, Doug, we're going to get you the help

1172
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,560
you need.

1173
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,560
Perfect.

1174
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,560
Perfect.

1175
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:26,560
Hell yes.

1176
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,560
Whooped it is.

1177
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,720
Hell yes.

1178
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,720
Whooped it is.

1179
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,560
Hell yes.
