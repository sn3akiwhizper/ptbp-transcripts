Welcome, my children, to the family reunion that is PTBP.

00:05.860 --> 00:09.140
It's your Auntie Wolf here to talk your ear off

00:09.140 --> 00:13.340
while feeding you some room temp potato salad.

00:13.340 --> 00:17.380
If your potato salad ain't wet and milky,

00:17.380 --> 00:19.300
you're making it wrong.

00:19.300 --> 00:23.300
I'm feeding you live from 694.2.

00:23.300 --> 00:27.080
I think maybe from Ocean City still.

00:27.080 --> 00:29.860
I don't know, man, I ain't looked outside in a minute.

00:29.860 --> 00:33.660
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Rob in Atlanta.

00:33.660 --> 00:34.700
Rob writes,

00:34.700 --> 00:39.000
"'Mornin', Wolf, big fan Rob callin' in from the city.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.580

"'ignore all kinds of laws.

01:24.280 --> 01:28.440
"'I bet y'all would get along together real nice.

01:28.440 --> 01:32.480
"'I have no idea what this song is you speak of,

01:32.480 --> 01:34.840
"'and I know so many songs.

01:37.840 --> 01:40.600
"'I can hardly keep track of them all.

01:40.600 --> 01:44.380

01:44.380 --> 01:46.220

["Bad in a Good Way"]

03:53.060 --> 03:57.800
Feels like I'm on the last bend of the deep end,

03:57.800 --> 04:01.640
but the drowning's been just fine.

04:01.640 --> 04:05.960
And when my ears pop and the shell shock

04:05.960 --> 04:09.960
of this pit stop frees my mind,

04:09.960 --> 04:13.920
I'll be all right, I can go there,

04:13.920 --> 04:18.080
now that I've stared death in the face.

04:18.080 --> 04:22.080
I'll be all right, I can go there,

04:22.080 --> 04:25.800
now that I've stared death in the face.

04:32.960 --> 04:33.800
Hey, hey!

04:33.800 --> 04:37.560
Bing bong, roly jays, do bing bong, roly jays.

04:37.560 --> 04:38.400
Hey, hey!

Bing bong, roly jays, bing bong, roly jays.

04:42.360 --> 04:47.360
Everybody now, bing bong, roly jays, bing bong, roly jays.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.480
So do you guys remember back in,

04:49.480 --> 04:51.520
oh gosh, how long ago was this?

04:51.520 --> 04:54.080
There was a few years ago where suddenly

04:54.080 --> 04:56.520
everyone that Taylor and I knew from college,

04:56.520 --> 04:57.680
Taylor being my wife,

04:57.680 --> 04:59.280
for those of you who are new to listening,

04:59.280 --> 05:01.040
you can see her guest appearing

05:01.040 --> 05:02.960
in certain parts of the podcast

05:02.960 --> 05:05.300
in season one and pretending to be b-ball.

05:05.940 --> 05:07.300
Uh, but-

05:07.300 --> 05:08.740
Was that a reference to season one?

05:08.740 --> 05:09.580
God, no!

05:09.580 --> 05:10.900
You said no references.

05:10.900 --> 05:12.940
Ah, no references to season one.

05:12.940 --> 05:15.020
So when Taylor and I were younger,

05:15.980 --> 05:19.440
we're 29 now, when we were probably 25,

05:19.440 --> 05:21.580
a lot of people here that we knew from college

05:21.580 --> 05:24.000
in Springfield, Missouri started getting married,

05:24.000 --> 05:27.300
and I was supposed to dress for weddings,

05:27.300 --> 05:29.620
and I didn't have any fucking money at all,

05:29.620 --> 05:33.820
and so I was like, basically what would happen

05:33.820 --> 05:36.380
is I didn't have clothes to wear to a wedding,

05:36.380 --> 05:39.460
so every single time I got invited to a wedding,

05:39.460 --> 05:41.900
I would go to Kohl's,

05:41.900 --> 05:46.100
because Kohl's has an insane return policy,

05:46.100 --> 05:49.740
a very, very good lax return policy,

05:49.740 --> 05:53.420
and so I would go and I would get a nice tie

05:53.420 --> 05:57.140
or a nice suit coat or whatever I needed

05:57.140 --> 05:58.940
to go to this wedding.

05:58.940 --> 06:01.780
I actually, I said tie, but I never wear ties,

06:01.780 --> 06:05.860
but I remember specifically for this story,

06:05.860 --> 06:08.660
I got a new suit jacket from Kohl's,

06:08.660 --> 06:12.420
a nice discount suit jacket that looked nice on me,

06:12.420 --> 06:15.020
and then I wore it to this wedding,

06:15.020 --> 06:17.280
and this wedding was actually really fun,

06:17.280 --> 06:21.060
but it was one of Taylor's friends from a long time,

06:21.060 --> 06:23.940
family, friends from an early age.

06:23.940 --> 06:25.980
Zach, I just wanna get one thing clear real quick.

06:25.980 --> 06:27.020
Yeah, hit me with it.

06:27.020 --> 06:27.900
You lied about the tie.

06:27.900 --> 06:29.140
How much of the rest of this is a lie?

06:29.140 --> 06:30.220
Oh, all of it.

06:30.220 --> 06:31.060
Yeah.

06:31.060 --> 06:36.060
I was all set up, and so I went to this wedding,

06:37.500 --> 06:39.880
and I didn't know anyone there,

06:39.880 --> 06:43.700
and Taylor was in this group of four girls.

06:43.700 --> 06:45.260
She was one of the bridesmaids,

06:45.260 --> 06:48.520
and they were just having the time of their life

06:48.520 --> 06:52.160
all reminiscing about when they were growing up together,

06:52.160 --> 06:57.160
and I was pretty lit and did the photo booth by myself.

06:57.160 --> 07:00.160
And did the photo booth by myself.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.000
Well, it.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.720
So there was a photo booth there

07:04.720 --> 07:06.440
that would take four pictures of you

07:06.440 --> 07:09.500
and then spit out a little image there

07:09.500 --> 07:11.360
like you might in a photo booth,

07:11.360 --> 07:13.380
and there were lots of little props there,

07:13.380 --> 07:17.600
so I put on four different hats and just stared ominously

07:18.660 --> 07:22.980
directly into the camera with the saddest face

07:22.980 --> 07:24.320
that I could muster,

07:24.360 --> 07:27.960
and so I had this amazing group of four pictures of me

07:27.960 --> 07:31.220
in this looking fresh in this Kohl's suit,

07:32.120 --> 07:34.240
and I took these pictures, and I was like,

07:34.240 --> 07:37.160
man, I am gonna love these pictures forever,

07:37.160 --> 07:40.080
and I stuck them in the inside pocket of my suit jacket,

07:40.080 --> 07:43.280
and then I returned that jacket to Kohl's,

07:43.280 --> 07:45.320
and as soon as I walked out the door,

07:45.320 --> 07:46.760
I thought, oh no,

07:48.520 --> 07:52.760
there is a picture of me inside of the pocket of that jacket

07:52.760 --> 07:55.800
and not only is it just a weird set of four pictures

07:55.800 --> 08:00.680
of a guy by himself looking sad as possible,

08:00.680 --> 08:01.800
he's wearing that suit jacket.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.640
But he's wearing the jacket that you just bought, yeah.

08:04.640 --> 08:06.380
At least it looks like you're having a bad time

08:06.380 --> 08:07.220
in that jacket.

08:07.220 --> 08:11.600
Right, so if the Kohl's return person found it,

08:11.600 --> 08:13.000
they would be like, oh, well, I see.

08:13.000 --> 08:13.840
I see.

08:13.840 --> 08:14.660
He did not enjoy the jacket.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.200
He had a bad time.

08:16.200 --> 08:19.480
This jacket would only bring forth negative memories

08:19.480 --> 08:21.640
for this saddeman, but if he did,

08:21.640 --> 08:23.240
just like throw it back on the rack,

08:23.240 --> 08:25.520
somebody had the biggest mind fuck.

08:25.520 --> 08:27.480
Yeah, straight up.

08:27.480 --> 08:28.320
Maybe not.

08:28.320 --> 08:30.000
They probably realized immediately what had happened.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.360
That's weird that my suit jacket

08:31.360 --> 08:33.000
is coming with stock photos.

08:35.040 --> 08:38.400
Of a sad man in this jacket?

08:38.400 --> 08:40.020
This kid looks poor.

08:41.680 --> 08:42.800
They would have said,

08:42.800 --> 08:46.500
based on how scraggly my beard probably was.

08:47.680 --> 08:48.520
Yep.

08:49.160 --> 08:50.720
Yep.

08:50.720 --> 08:53.120
You were a great big fat person back then, right?

08:55.240 --> 08:57.040
Buffalo Bill would have liked you.

08:58.080 --> 08:58.920
Nope, nope.

08:58.920 --> 08:59.760
No, that's just for us.

08:59.760 --> 09:01.280
I am not editing that out.

09:01.280 --> 09:02.480
No, do take out the body shaming.

09:02.480 --> 09:05.760
That's just because we watched Silence of the Lambs.

09:05.760 --> 09:08.800
Literally, then it makes sense for this exact moment.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.800
I know, and you were a great big fat person.

09:10.800 --> 09:15.800
I quit drinking soda

09:16.200 --> 09:19.840
and I quit drinking Tom Collins' every night,

09:19.840 --> 09:23.720
which at the time, for some reason, my mind was like,

09:23.720 --> 09:26.000
I don't understand how every night

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
when I drink three pint-sized gin and tonics

09:31.680 --> 09:36.680
with extra syrupy lime juice poured on top of it,

09:36.800 --> 09:39.600
I don't understand why I'm getting so fat.

09:40.800 --> 09:41.640
Yep.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.080
So much sugar.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.400
The calories in a drink will get to you, folks.

09:46.400 --> 09:47.880
Yeah, but the calories in a drink

09:47.880 --> 09:52.880
that's also filled with syrupy sugar is also no bueno.

09:53.200 --> 09:58.000
I was literally putting simple syrup and sugary lime juice

09:58.000 --> 10:00.620
in a drink that already had tonic water in it

10:00.620 --> 10:04.600
because at the time, I didn't know that tonic water

10:04.600 --> 10:06.440
already had a bunch of sugar in it.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.120
Like as much as a soda.

10:08.120 --> 10:08.960
That's why it's good.

10:08.960 --> 10:10.120
That's why it's so fucking good.

10:11.040 --> 10:13.400
Ah, so now I just drink beer.

10:13.400 --> 10:17.680
It's honest, you know?

10:19.240 --> 10:20.320
It is what it is.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.880
Beer, for when you're counting calories.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.040
It's fermented.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.760
You can count a whole lot of them.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.840
If you're practicing this well.

10:27.840 --> 10:29.780
Saw a tweet that said I'm Midwest sober,

10:29.780 --> 10:32.200
which means I'm just drinking beer these days.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.680
Holy shit.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.520
There was a, in Mad Men,

10:35.520 --> 10:39.280
there was this guy like peed himself before a meeting

10:39.280 --> 10:41.160
and they're like, you gotta go to rehab.

10:41.160 --> 10:43.040
And one guy was like, yeah, I know,

10:43.040 --> 10:45.520
so and so went to rehab and he only drinks beer now,

10:45.520 --> 10:46.480
so he's doing good.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.240
That actor.

10:49.240 --> 10:50.060
Isn't that Brian Doyle Murphy?

10:50.060 --> 10:51.480
Yeah, he was in God Bless America.

10:51.480 --> 10:52.440
Brian Doyle Murray.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.720
And that movie fucking rules.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.720
Yeah, it does.

10:56.720 --> 10:57.560
It really does.

10:57.560 --> 10:58.380
Right, it does rule.

10:58.380 --> 10:59.220
It's fucked up.

10:59.220 --> 11:00.060
You know what?

11:00.060 --> 11:00.880
I haven't seen it in a long time.

11:00.880 --> 11:01.720
You're right, it might suck.

11:01.720 --> 11:02.560
I don't know, it might suck.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.480
I only recognize that guy from Shameless.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.120
He played like a cuck.

11:06.120 --> 11:09.200
He played William H. Macy in Shameless.

11:10.020 --> 11:10.860
It's Bill Murray's brother.

11:10.860 --> 11:11.680
Yeah, he's Bill Murray's brother.

11:11.680 --> 11:12.520
What?

11:12.520 --> 11:14.880
Yeah, guys, he's pretty famous.

11:14.880 --> 11:17.100
Not Bill Murray famous, but sure.

11:17.100 --> 11:18.160
I don't think it is.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.320
The guy that I'm thinking of?

11:19.320 --> 11:21.800
If you're thinking of Brian Doyle Murray, then it is.

11:21.800 --> 11:22.640
If you're thinking of the guy

11:22.640 --> 11:24.480
who pisses pants in Mad Men, that is.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.480
That's not Brian Doyle Murray, is it?

11:26.480 --> 11:27.320
Yeah, it is.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.140
Yeah, it totally is.

11:28.140 --> 11:28.980
Hold on.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.000
What's his character's name in that?

11:30.000 --> 11:30.840
And that's his whole deal,

11:30.840 --> 11:32.460
is that he's the fun drunk guy, right?

11:32.460 --> 11:34.280
Until it becomes too much of a problem.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.700
Yeah, this guy's not in Mad Men.

11:36.700 --> 11:37.540
The guy you're thinking of?

11:37.540 --> 11:38.360
So that's what I was gonna say.

11:38.400 --> 11:39.240
It's his other brother.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.760
Look up Bill Murray's brothers.

11:40.760 --> 11:41.600
Other brother.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.420
Yeah.

11:42.420 --> 11:45.640
He's another brother, and they eat nutter butters.

11:45.640 --> 11:46.480
Butter, butter.

11:46.480 --> 11:47.320
Dude, nutter butter.

11:47.320 --> 11:49.040
I fuck with a nutter butter.

11:49.040 --> 11:49.880
Yeah, dude.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.520
For some reason, on the outside of a nutter butter.

11:51.520 --> 11:52.360
Joel Murray.

11:52.360 --> 11:54.280
Hold on, I'm talking about nutter butter.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.920
I didn't know that was Bill Murray's brother.

11:55.920 --> 11:58.880
Oh shit, I thought Joel Murray was Brian Doyle Murray.

11:58.880 --> 12:02.520
Oh, this whole time it was Joel, not Brian Doyle?

12:02.520 --> 12:06.360
Yeah, Joel is in Mad Men, and God bless America.

12:06.360 --> 12:07.200
God bless America.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.120
Yes, yeah.

12:08.720 --> 12:09.760
What were you saying, though?

12:09.760 --> 12:11.200
Before I rudely interrupted.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.400
He was waxing poetic about nutter butters.

12:14.320 --> 12:15.160
Oh, nice.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.460
It's the sugar crystals on the outside

12:17.460 --> 12:20.240
that really do it for me, if I'm being completely wrong.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.920
There is nothing more horrifying

12:22.920 --> 12:24.520
than listening to a podcast,

12:24.520 --> 12:27.200
and you know that the hosts are incorrect.

12:28.720 --> 12:30.200
And they keep saying the thing.

12:30.200 --> 12:33.960
If I knew who Joel Murray was in my heart,

12:33.960 --> 12:35.220
I would hate this.

12:35.620 --> 12:40.200
Good, let's give him some negative feels,

12:40.200 --> 12:42.980
because we are dealing with some very

12:42.980 --> 12:45.820
unsettling situations here.

12:45.820 --> 12:48.820
Wait, what are the peanut chocolate peanut butter?

12:48.820 --> 12:49.760
Nutter butters.

12:49.760 --> 12:51.140
Wafer things?

12:51.140 --> 12:54.020
Oh, I know exactly.

12:54.020 --> 12:54.860
Oh.

12:54.860 --> 12:55.700
What are those called?

12:55.700 --> 12:56.620
Fuck.

12:56.620 --> 12:58.260
I like those more than nutter butters,

12:58.260 --> 12:59.580
but I do like nutter butters.

12:59.580 --> 13:02.420
Oh, chocolate.

13:02.420 --> 13:03.380
Are those puffer nutters?

13:03.380 --> 13:04.220
Peanut.

13:04.220 --> 13:05.040
No.

13:05.860 --> 13:06.700
Wafers.

13:06.700 --> 13:07.540
What the fuck?

13:07.540 --> 13:09.240
Are called nutty buddies.

13:09.240 --> 13:10.440
Nutty buddies, yeah.

13:10.440 --> 13:11.960
Or nutty bars.

13:11.960 --> 13:12.800
Yeah, nutty buddies.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.080
What the fuck is a nutter butter?

13:14.080 --> 13:15.960
Nutter butters are shaped like a peanut, aren't they?

13:15.960 --> 13:18.200
Yes, they are, and there's no chocolate.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.700
And a fluffer nutter is marshmallow

13:20.700 --> 13:22.100
and peanut butter sandwich.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.400
Is that exactly what Elvis ate?

13:24.400 --> 13:27.040
No, he liked something with peanut butter jelly

13:27.040 --> 13:27.880
and bananas.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.240
That's right, peanut butter, banana, and honey.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.080
And honey.

13:31.080 --> 13:31.900
And chocolate.

13:31.900 --> 13:33.520
You're just the devil in disguise.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.440
That's a fun Elvis song.

13:36.440 --> 13:37.280
Thank you.

13:37.280 --> 13:40.600
All right, let's get a recap of where we were at last time

13:40.600 --> 13:45.160
because it's been one, I mean, we can let them in.

13:45.160 --> 13:47.440
It's not been one week for us,

13:47.440 --> 13:49.720
but it has been one week for the listener.

13:49.720 --> 13:51.880
So let's give them a nice little recap

13:51.880 --> 13:56.000
to get them in the mod for where we are now.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.200
Shit's fucked up in Ocean City, New Jersey.

13:58.200 --> 13:59.520
Yeah, it really is.

13:59.520 --> 14:02.040
We got freaking, what's his first name?

14:02.040 --> 14:03.040
Arvin Chilton.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.960
We got an ex-Delta Green agent slicing up eyeballs.

14:05.960 --> 14:09.440
That's right, and not slicing through the eyeballs.

14:09.440 --> 14:11.300
Girl, you're so groovy.

14:11.300 --> 14:13.880
I want you to know.

14:13.880 --> 14:14.720
I don't know.

14:14.720 --> 14:15.560
Slicing up eyeballs?

14:15.560 --> 14:16.400
No, I don't know it.

14:16.400 --> 14:17.220
Look, do you know it?

14:17.220 --> 14:20.060
I am on chin and a Lucia.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.360
Pixies, bro.

14:22.360 --> 14:23.200
It's a Pixies song.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.200
That's why I said it.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.120
Cool.

14:28.120 --> 14:29.440
Cool, yeah.

14:29.440 --> 14:30.520
I read Fight Club.

14:31.040 --> 14:35.440
That was, yeah, Frank Black's best book.

14:38.040 --> 14:39.440
What's Kim's deal, though?

14:39.440 --> 14:41.600
All right, so when you guys.

14:41.600 --> 14:42.440
I get it.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.480
Her deal is that she's in a better band.

14:46.480 --> 14:47.320
Yeah.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.200
Things are bad in Ocean City, New Jersey.

14:49.200 --> 14:50.360
We got an ex-Delta Green agent

14:50.360 --> 14:52.120
who's killing people close to him in his life.

14:52.120 --> 14:53.880
Slicing up eyeballs.

14:53.880 --> 14:55.200
Slicing up eyeballs.

14:55.200 --> 14:56.480
Well, he's not slicing them up, though.

14:56.480 --> 14:57.560
He removed them carefully.

14:57.560 --> 14:59.740
He's taking them out real surgically.

14:59.780 --> 15:00.620
We got down there.

15:00.620 --> 15:02.100
We met up with an FBI agent

15:02.100 --> 15:04.660
who pointed us toward his domicile,

15:04.660 --> 15:07.180
and we went and talked to the landlord there.

15:07.180 --> 15:08.800
He was kind of a weird guy,

15:08.800 --> 15:10.620
and then I think it was him who recommended

15:10.620 --> 15:13.300
we go over to a cafe and have a little lunch.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.100
That was actually Mara Kinlan.

15:15.100 --> 15:15.940
Oh, that's right.

15:15.940 --> 15:18.620
We went back and talked to the NYPD who had been on this.

15:18.620 --> 15:20.660
She was, yeah, she was Newark.

15:20.660 --> 15:21.500
Newark.

15:21.500 --> 15:22.340
Newark, yeah.

15:22.340 --> 15:23.820
Did she give us anything good?

15:23.820 --> 15:26.020
She disagreed with Uncle Jimmy

15:26.020 --> 15:28.660
on the fact that Eileen McCarty,

15:28.660 --> 15:32.800
he had this idea that Eileen McCarty was not the body

15:32.800 --> 15:34.380
that was found in her own home

15:34.380 --> 15:37.180
because she was seen by witnesses in two locations.

15:37.180 --> 15:39.160
But she was like, it's definitely her.

15:39.160 --> 15:41.540
Yeah, and then later, Agent Sparrow,

15:41.540 --> 15:45.380
when she was looking over the actual high-res

15:45.380 --> 15:47.860
like digital files from crime scene photos,

15:47.860 --> 15:50.940
came to the same conclusion because Garza,

15:50.940 --> 15:52.400
Uncle Jimmy with the FBI,

15:52.400 --> 15:54.840
was using these like printed out-

15:54.840 --> 15:55.680
Mayonnaise covered.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.860
Mayonnaise covered crime scene photos.

15:57.900 --> 16:00.300
Uncle Jimmy was, he was gross.

16:00.300 --> 16:01.400
Yeah, he was gross.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.240
He was gross.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.780
Yeah, Agent Garza was pretty unprofessional.

16:04.780 --> 16:08.660
We went to Arvin Chilton's apartment duplex,

16:08.660 --> 16:11.140
which was above Alexander Duchesne's apartment.

16:11.140 --> 16:12.500
Well done.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.780
Who did that without notes?

16:13.780 --> 16:14.620
I did.

16:14.620 --> 16:16.100
I don't take notes, folks.

16:18.200 --> 16:19.980
And we looked around.

16:19.980 --> 16:23.300
He had a bunch of Shakespeare in his duplex.

16:23.300 --> 16:26.580
And then we went downstairs and his landlord,

16:26.580 --> 16:28.060
who lives below him,

16:28.060 --> 16:31.580
had a copy of As I Lay Dying.

16:34.340 --> 16:36.460
It was actually the things they carried.

16:36.460 --> 16:38.300
Mother Faulkner and-

16:38.300 --> 16:40.220
He had a copy of That Thing You Do.

16:41.820 --> 16:44.800
He had a copy of There's Something About Mary.

16:44.800 --> 16:47.380
And it was clearly overdue from Blockbuster.

16:47.380 --> 16:48.220
That's right.

16:48.220 --> 16:49.060
Which still existed in 4060.

16:49.060 --> 16:53.220
It was called Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.140
And we all sat down and watched it.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.940
Luke, we literally sat down and had it on

16:57.940 --> 17:00.220
before this started.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.080
What's it called?

17:03.440 --> 17:04.280
What's it start with?

17:04.280 --> 17:05.100
As.

17:05.100 --> 17:06.100
As I Lay Dying.

17:08.860 --> 17:09.700
Band of the Book.

17:09.700 --> 17:10.540
The book.

17:10.540 --> 17:12.740
Or the James Franco adaptation of the novel.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.300
That one.

17:14.300 --> 17:17.580
No, his adaptation was the band of the band.

17:17.580 --> 17:19.060
I didn't watch it for obvious reasons.

17:19.060 --> 17:21.980
James Franco in the band As I Lay Dying.

17:21.980 --> 17:24.460
As the world turns,

17:25.980 --> 17:30.140
as you is mad.

17:30.140 --> 17:33.220
As you imagined it.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.420
Imagine dragging these balls on my face.

17:36.980 --> 17:40.620
As you, I don't know what it was called.

17:40.620 --> 17:44.220
I did look right at the title when we turned it on.

17:44.220 --> 17:46.620
I know, and it's also a really famous Shakespeare play

17:46.620 --> 17:49.260
that you've undoubtedly heard the title of

17:49.260 --> 17:51.300
countless times in your life.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.060
The Wind Flies.

17:53.060 --> 17:53.900
I don't know what it is.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.260
As the Crow Flows.

17:55.260 --> 17:56.100
As You Like It.

17:56.100 --> 17:58.540
As You Like It, as I said.

17:58.540 --> 18:00.220
Do you like that?

18:00.220 --> 18:03.340
I can't believe you made that great As They Lay Dying joke

18:03.340 --> 18:05.260
without knowing what it was called.

18:06.620 --> 18:07.460
I knew it was ads.

18:07.460 --> 18:09.020
He had the ads, yeah.

18:09.020 --> 18:12.060
Anyway, the landlord had a copy of that,

18:12.060 --> 18:13.860
said that it was fitting,

18:13.860 --> 18:16.940
and all of us having read that book play

18:16.940 --> 18:19.700
and watch the college production of it.

18:19.700 --> 18:21.720
We all pegged exactly what that meant, for sure.

18:21.720 --> 18:23.500
Steely Dan was involved.

18:24.060 --> 18:26.700
Pink, come back to me.

18:26.700 --> 18:27.900
Anyway, he had a copy of that.

18:27.900 --> 18:28.900
He said it was fitting,

18:28.900 --> 18:33.180
and we knew that there's disguises involved in that book.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.240
And he smelled like bandages.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.080
What else did we find out?

18:36.080 --> 18:37.620
Here's what's involved in that play,

18:37.620 --> 18:40.900
is people pretending to be things that they're not.

18:40.900 --> 18:43.500
People pretending to be other people.

18:43.500 --> 18:44.420
Which we pointed out.

18:44.420 --> 18:46.700
We already did the joke about our game,

18:46.700 --> 18:48.300
so we're not gonna do that again.

18:48.300 --> 18:49.820
We've done that.

18:49.820 --> 18:50.660
Get over it.

18:50.660 --> 18:51.480
But that is,

18:52.360 --> 18:53.520
but that's the gist of it.

18:53.520 --> 18:58.520
There's also some rural urban class friction themes.

18:58.640 --> 18:59.480
It's pretty good.

18:59.480 --> 19:02.600
I watched 30 minutes of it and then read the synopsis.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.760
What else happened?

19:05.760 --> 19:07.520
That's when we went over to the cafe,

19:07.520 --> 19:08.640
and the waitress said,

19:08.640 --> 19:10.720
man, there's this weird graffiti around the corner.

19:10.720 --> 19:11.960
You should take a peek at it.

19:11.960 --> 19:14.280
And boy, was it some weird graffiti.

19:14.280 --> 19:17.680
Yeah, and we got really lucky with a critical role

19:17.680 --> 19:20.080
that allowed us to season three.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.840
I don't listen to that nerd shit.

19:21.840 --> 19:22.680
I don't either.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.360
That allowed us to recognize

19:26.360 --> 19:28.720
it as a symbol of the Testament of New Flesh,

19:28.720 --> 19:33.160
which is an organization obsessed with magic.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.000
They chant in Aklo, a pre-human language.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.440
Aklo language.

19:38.440 --> 19:43.440
Yeah, and they worship some sort of eternal and elder being.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.120
Oh shit, is this gonna be real Cthulhu?

19:47.120 --> 19:48.120
Are we gonna meet Cthulhu?

19:48.120 --> 19:49.160
Do you wanna meet Cthulhu?

19:49.160 --> 19:50.080
I wanna meet Cthulhu.

19:50.080 --> 19:51.600
We have in a campaign, haven't we?

19:51.600 --> 19:54.600
Yeah, we had Cthulhu end one of our campaigns.

19:54.600 --> 19:55.440
That's true.

19:55.440 --> 19:57.680
Joe's character was on the beach looking out.

19:57.680 --> 19:58.520
Yeah.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.880
Yeah, that was pretty rad.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.840
As Cthulhu just rose up.

20:04.840 --> 20:07.480
Weren't the minions lifting me in the air?

20:07.480 --> 20:11.200
The star spawn were lifting you up into the air

20:11.200 --> 20:12.040
off the beach.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.320
The minions from Despicable Me.

20:13.320 --> 20:14.520
The minions from Despicable Me.

20:14.520 --> 20:16.280
Stuart was there.

20:16.280 --> 20:17.480
Kevin, Bob.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.280
Yeah, all the classics.

20:19.280 --> 20:20.120
I was gonna say,

20:20.120 --> 20:25.120
I would rather have run into the Testament of Nude Flesh.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.120
That's clever.

20:34.440 --> 20:35.280
Cause you horny?

20:35.280 --> 20:36.360
Cause I'm horny.

20:38.360 --> 20:39.880
Everybody out there.

20:39.880 --> 20:42.640
I'm really glad that out of all the different characters

20:42.640 --> 20:46.520
that you guys have made for games that I've run for you,

20:46.520 --> 20:48.080
none of you have ever been like,

20:48.080 --> 20:51.320
and my character is horny.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.880
If you wanna flirt with me,

20:54.880 --> 20:56.200
you can do it out of game.

20:58.120 --> 20:59.800
That's my rule.

20:59.800 --> 21:00.720
Is that where we ended?

21:00.720 --> 21:01.560
No.

21:01.560 --> 21:02.400
What happened next?

21:02.400 --> 21:04.480
We got a rude phone call that ruined our day.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.480
And it was Duchenne saying that he had just gotten

21:06.480 --> 21:08.480
a phone call that ruined his day.

21:08.480 --> 21:11.640
And it was that Arvin had called and said, you're next.

21:11.640 --> 21:13.280
So we sped over there.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.640
How did he say that, Luke?

21:15.520 --> 21:16.720
Oh, I'm gonna kill you.

21:16.720 --> 21:17.560
Yeah.

21:20.560 --> 21:22.160
Oh, I'm gonna kill you.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.120
Slicing up eyeballs.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.440
It sounded like you said slicing up bibles.

21:29.440 --> 21:30.840
Slicing up bibles.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.520
New Testament, gone.

21:33.640 --> 21:34.840
Mickey says eyeballs.

21:36.440 --> 21:37.800
Slicing up eyeballs.

21:39.720 --> 21:43.760
And then we found out that he was in Ocean City.

21:45.480 --> 21:46.320
No, we did not.

21:46.320 --> 21:48.760
What we found out is that the phone call

21:48.760 --> 21:52.320
came from Arvin Chilton's phone, which is in Ocean City.

21:52.320 --> 21:56.120
And specifically, we found out after we went to go

21:56.120 --> 21:57.920
keep watch over Duchenne that night.

21:57.920 --> 21:59.160
We've got uniform PD.

21:59.160 --> 22:01.400
We also had, yeah.

22:01.400 --> 22:04.200
And we arrived ourselves at Duchenne's house.

22:04.200 --> 22:05.760
When we called Chilton's phone,

22:05.760 --> 22:07.840
we heard it vibrating upstairs.

22:07.840 --> 22:10.200
And that's where we ended off.

22:10.200 --> 22:13.440
Someone made an intelligence check about As You Like It.

22:13.440 --> 22:15.480
I believe it was Agent Sparrow.

22:15.480 --> 22:17.320
Which you passed and therefore you were allowed

22:17.320 --> 22:19.680
to watch As You Like It today before we came in.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.160
Right.

22:21.160 --> 22:22.720
Otherwise you wouldn't have let me out of the cage.

22:22.720 --> 22:26.080
I would have said, you cannot get out of this cage, Thomas.

22:26.080 --> 22:27.760
Does it smell like David still?

22:27.760 --> 22:29.200
I got some free time though.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.800
And I watched As You Like It.

22:31.800 --> 22:33.240
Why did we let him go?

22:33.240 --> 22:34.080
I don't know.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.000
It was such a rookie move.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.480
It was so much fun to be a player.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.960
All right, let's dig in.

22:41.960 --> 22:45.120
It's March 25th, 2016.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.120
The three of you are standing

22:46.120 --> 22:48.000
in Arvin Chilton's apartment.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.700
Say your character's names real quick

22:49.700 --> 22:51.680
and your character voices starting with Joe.

22:51.680 --> 22:52.520
Ellen Walling.

22:52.520 --> 22:53.340
Now Luke.

22:53.340 --> 22:54.180
Kevin Gelato.

22:54.180 --> 22:55.100
Now Thomas.

22:55.100 --> 22:56.360
Agent Clarissa Sparrow.

22:56.360 --> 22:57.960
Wow, I loved that.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.120
We should do that more often.

22:59.120 --> 23:03.040
Okay, it's March 25th, 2016.

23:03.040 --> 23:06.680
You're all in Alexander Duchenne's apartment.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.200
It is pouring down rain outside.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.160
It is now dark.

23:12.160 --> 23:14.800
There are four squad cars outside.

23:14.800 --> 23:18.560
You know that there are some ocean city.

23:18.560 --> 23:19.400
Some ocean.

23:19.400 --> 23:20.220
Sorry, I've got to snap.

23:20.220 --> 23:21.060
I've got to take this.

23:21.060 --> 23:21.900
Yeah, of course.

23:21.900 --> 23:25.440
There's some ocean shitty police officers outside

23:27.120 --> 23:29.240
who had their kick the dog moment

23:29.240 --> 23:31.000
when they made fun of Kevin Gelato.

23:32.300 --> 23:35.760
Yeah, he hasn't forgotten that.

23:35.760 --> 23:37.040
He doesn't forget much.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.800
And as the three of you are standing

23:38.800 --> 23:40.640
inside Alexander Duchenne's apartment,

23:40.640 --> 23:44.560
you've asked him to call back Arvin Chilton.

23:46.600 --> 23:47.440
Brring, brring.

23:47.440 --> 23:48.260
Brring, brring.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.100
Brring, brring.

23:49.100 --> 23:49.940
Brring, brring.

23:49.940 --> 23:50.760
Brring, brring.

23:50.760 --> 23:51.600
Brring, brring.

23:51.600 --> 23:52.440
Brring, brring.

23:52.440 --> 23:53.260
Brring, brring.

23:53.260 --> 23:55.520
And you hear from upstairs,

23:55.520 --> 23:57.520
look at this photograph.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.520
Look at this photograph.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.280
Look at this photograph.

24:00.280 --> 24:04.920
Chad Krager classic photograph by Nickelback,

24:04.920 --> 24:08.340
which is the vibrate thin ring, ring tone.

24:09.800 --> 24:12.300
On Arvin Chilton's phone.

24:12.300 --> 24:15.340
Let's go ahead and move in dexterity order.

24:15.340 --> 24:17.600
So who has the highest dexterity?

24:17.600 --> 24:18.440
60.

24:18.440 --> 24:19.760
I got a 70.

24:19.760 --> 24:20.600
60.

24:20.600 --> 24:23.880
Joe, you were going to kick off in this-

24:23.880 --> 24:25.920
So the phone rings and we're in combat?

24:25.920 --> 24:30.280
Yeah, Joe is looking at me with like, incredulity.

24:30.280 --> 24:32.240
Is it like that we're racing upstairs?

24:32.240 --> 24:34.400
Nope, you can do whatever you want.

24:34.400 --> 24:37.920
Okay, Elwood would not be the first one out the door.

24:38.040 --> 24:39.000
Sure, you don't have to be.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.200
Just because you're acting first

24:40.200 --> 24:41.940
doesn't mean that you need to, you know.

24:41.940 --> 24:42.780
Gotcha.

24:42.780 --> 24:44.660
I thought that's what you were having us talk about,

24:44.660 --> 24:45.920
is marching order kind of thing.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.480
Well, we are talking,

24:47.480 --> 24:49.320
we're talking just about action order.

24:49.320 --> 24:51.040
So not marching order necessarily,

24:51.040 --> 24:54.180
but we're going to start with what do you do?

24:54.180 --> 24:55.720
Make wide eyes at the guys

24:55.720 --> 24:59.020
and do the silence over the mouth thing and point up.

24:59.020 --> 24:59.860
Awesome.

24:59.860 --> 25:01.920
I'm going to roll intelligence real quick.

25:03.360 --> 25:04.200
Pass.

25:04.200 --> 25:05.200
What are you looking for here?

25:05.200 --> 25:06.880
The song is by Nickelback.

25:06.960 --> 25:08.240
Thank you.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.480
I was going to do something if I failed my intelligence roll

25:10.480 --> 25:11.440
but I'm not going to do that.

25:11.440 --> 25:13.800
Always fun when a role player in your group

25:13.800 --> 25:17.240
decides to just voluntarily maybe fuck something up.

25:19.320 --> 25:20.160
Hey man.

25:21.160 --> 25:22.200
Zach's like, it's fun for me.

25:22.200 --> 25:25.080
It's also what you've been a part of forever.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.280
No, no, no, no, no.

25:27.280 --> 25:31.820
We stumble into hilarious farce.

25:33.220 --> 25:36.200
But if you're like, yeah, my guys yells.

25:37.440 --> 25:38.280
He's too dumb.

25:38.280 --> 25:40.080
It wasn't going to be that, but.

25:41.120 --> 25:41.960
Hello?

25:44.400 --> 25:46.400
Because Luke decided that he was thinking

25:46.400 --> 25:47.280
about doing something,

25:47.280 --> 25:50.000
let's just have agent Sparrow is going to go next.

25:50.000 --> 25:50.840
Cool.

25:50.840 --> 25:51.920
Agent Sparrow draws her gun

25:51.920 --> 25:53.760
when she hears the vibrating phone.

25:53.760 --> 25:57.080
And then she looks around to see how Duchenne is reacting.

25:57.080 --> 25:58.360
He is immediately like,

26:00.240 --> 26:01.320
and he's horrified.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.720
And he is like looking for a place to hide.

26:04.680 --> 26:06.160
Okay.

26:07.160 --> 26:10.480
Can I do any kind of examination of him?

26:10.480 --> 26:13.560
Like an ocular pat down and see if this is.

26:14.560 --> 26:16.600
I want to see if he's wearing a human suit.

26:18.600 --> 26:21.800
Okay, ocular pat down to see if he's wearing a human suit.

26:21.800 --> 26:23.080
What do you want to roll for that?

26:23.080 --> 26:23.920
What do you think?

26:23.920 --> 26:24.760
Medicine or?

26:24.760 --> 26:29.240
Search, medicine, intelligence, humans.

26:29.240 --> 26:31.760
I think you would be able to determine.

26:33.320 --> 26:35.520
My intelligence is telling me he's not human.

26:36.440 --> 26:37.280
Three.

26:37.280 --> 26:40.400
Oh, and three on the check.

26:40.400 --> 26:41.760
That was supposed to happen.

26:41.760 --> 26:42.600
It's on a timer.

26:45.480 --> 26:47.240
A light just turned out in the room.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.280
There's a grow light on the plants in the corner.

26:50.280 --> 26:51.720
Cause I don't get enough sun.

26:53.760 --> 26:57.160
He has the bearing of someone who is in public service

26:57.160 --> 26:58.560
who worked for the feds.

26:58.560 --> 27:00.920
Like the way that he reacted was something

27:00.920 --> 27:03.040
that someone with military experience.

27:03.040 --> 27:06.440
Like he's got big claws and fur all over him.

27:06.440 --> 27:07.960
What did I say?

27:07.960 --> 27:08.800
He said.

27:08.800 --> 27:09.640
He has the bearing.

27:09.640 --> 27:11.480
Oh my God.

27:11.480 --> 27:13.760
I was like, I know it was.

27:13.760 --> 27:15.600
I didn't think it was actually going to be relevant.

27:15.600 --> 27:20.320
I thought it was a real big reach.

27:20.320 --> 27:21.160
Like a bear might have.

27:21.160 --> 27:22.000
Like a bear has.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.600
Like a bear has.

27:24.600 --> 27:27.040
Thomas is forgetting his background.

27:27.040 --> 27:29.440
He was not in any kind of law enforcement or.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.520
All that you know about Alexander Duchene

27:31.520 --> 27:35.680
is that he supposedly played baseball when he was younger.

27:35.680 --> 27:38.120
And you like don't know if that was.

27:38.120 --> 27:40.400
I mean, he said he wasn't very good at it,

27:40.400 --> 27:42.400
but that's all you really got about him.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.920
You don't know a lot about him.

27:43.920 --> 27:46.320
He's old enough to have been retired though.

27:46.320 --> 27:48.480
And landlord is the retirement thing.

27:48.480 --> 27:49.800
Oh, a hundred percent.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.360
He's 79 years old.

27:51.360 --> 27:52.480
Yeah.

27:52.480 --> 27:56.360
Which like, you know, for me, I'll still be working.

27:56.360 --> 27:57.200
That's right.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.040
That's because.

27:58.040 --> 28:01.280
Yeah, everyone listening here will be working

28:01.280 --> 28:04.920
in the water mines until.

28:04.920 --> 28:07.560
But here in 2016, a 79 year old is still

28:07.560 --> 28:08.840
pulling social security.

28:08.840 --> 28:09.760
Right.

28:09.760 --> 28:12.080
Not working for Bezos H2O.

28:12.080 --> 28:14.680
When you say that, does he look like a 79 year old man

28:14.680 --> 28:15.760
who has that background?

28:15.760 --> 28:19.560
Or does this look like Arvin Chilton in the body

28:19.560 --> 28:22.880
or like something controlling his body in an unnatural way?

28:22.880 --> 28:27.080
Go ahead and roll sanity agent Sparrow.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.560
Pass 58 on a current 80.

28:29.560 --> 28:32.080
Yeah, this is just learning something new

28:32.080 --> 28:32.920
about Alexander D. Shane.

28:32.920 --> 28:36.160
Damn it, this is when I should have failed sanity, right?

28:36.160 --> 28:37.920
This is just learning something new

28:37.920 --> 28:39.600
about Alexander D. Shane.

28:39.600 --> 28:42.840
This is an interesting moment of conflict for Thomas.

28:42.840 --> 28:43.680
Yeah, of course.

28:43.680 --> 28:44.720
Because I have a lot of suspicions

28:44.720 --> 28:45.540
about what's going on here.

28:45.540 --> 28:46.380
Why wouldn't you?

28:46.380 --> 28:48.840
However, the main thing is that agent Sparrow

28:48.840 --> 28:51.640
doesn't know she's in a scenario called control copy.

28:51.640 --> 28:52.480
Sure.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.400
I don't know why you keep saying that

28:53.400 --> 28:54.960
because I don't know what that means.

28:54.960 --> 28:58.360
Shut the fuck up.

29:00.360 --> 29:01.360
Don't gaslight me.

29:01.360 --> 29:05.100
I don't know anything about computers.

29:05.100 --> 29:06.920
No, it's your job, but.

29:06.920 --> 29:09.040
It's my job to gaslight you.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.620
That's what a DM does.

29:12.560 --> 29:15.880
In Delta Green, yeah, like half the time for sure.

29:15.880 --> 29:16.720
Yeah.

29:16.720 --> 29:19.480
So without metagaming, what do you do next?

29:20.840 --> 29:22.680
Like my only possible actions

29:22.680 --> 29:24.300
lead me towards a terrible fate.

29:24.500 --> 29:25.580
Right, yeah.

29:25.580 --> 29:27.500
But I guess that's the game we play, so.

29:27.500 --> 29:28.340
It is.

29:28.340 --> 29:30.940
She, passing that sanity test,

29:30.940 --> 29:33.420
she all of a sudden thinks he might be

29:33.420 --> 29:35.980
a little more capable than she estimated.

29:35.980 --> 29:36.820
Sure.

29:36.820 --> 29:40.420
So she says to the uniformed PD,

29:40.420 --> 29:42.860
you stay on him, you protect him.

29:42.860 --> 29:44.420
I'm going upstairs.

29:44.420 --> 29:46.340
Luke, what is Kevin Gelato doing?

29:46.340 --> 29:49.800
He looks up at where the vibration is coming from

29:49.800 --> 29:51.740
and looks down at his hand.

29:51.740 --> 29:53.140
Which is balled up into a fist.

29:53.140 --> 29:53.980
Right.

29:54.500 --> 29:57.060
Sorry, let me say that again without vaping my mouth.

29:57.060 --> 29:59.440
He looks down at his hand, which is balled up into a fist,

29:59.440 --> 30:03.460
but then he sees Sparrow start heading towards the door

30:03.460 --> 30:05.580
and decides to follow her.

30:05.580 --> 30:06.580
I'll go first.

30:06.580 --> 30:08.260
And he heads up the stairs.

30:08.260 --> 30:09.260
No, no, wait.

30:09.260 --> 30:10.500
He waits.

30:10.500 --> 30:11.860
Let me in first.

30:11.860 --> 30:13.980
He lets her in front of him.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.900
Okay, are you approaching the stairs stealthily

30:16.900 --> 30:18.700
or are you gonna run up them?

30:18.700 --> 30:20.900
Stealthily, but quickly.

30:20.900 --> 30:22.060
Which one of the two of you

30:22.060 --> 30:24.480
has the worst stealth of the two?

30:25.700 --> 30:26.540
I don't have any.

30:26.540 --> 30:27.360
I have 10%.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.200
Yeah, same.

30:28.200 --> 30:29.540
Okay, so either one of you can roll.

30:31.840 --> 30:32.680
You should roll.

30:34.680 --> 30:35.780
I got a 91.

30:36.740 --> 30:38.820
She's like running up like FBI.

30:38.820 --> 30:41.100
She's not saying it, but she runs up the stairs,

30:41.100 --> 30:41.940
drawn gone.

30:41.940 --> 30:45.220
And behind her, I mean, behind her, you hear.

30:45.220 --> 30:47.820
Dump, dump, dump.

30:47.820 --> 30:48.640
Wha-choo!

30:48.640 --> 30:52.800
Bless you, but be quiet.

30:52.800 --> 30:54.340
And the door is closed.

30:54.340 --> 30:55.580
Locked?

30:55.580 --> 30:57.120
No, she opens it.

30:57.120 --> 30:59.680
So just like in Silence of the Lambs,

30:59.680 --> 31:00.980
which we watched yesterday,

31:00.980 --> 31:03.240
remember at her Quantico training,

31:03.240 --> 31:04.560
where she gets capped.

31:04.560 --> 31:05.960
Oh, yeah.

31:05.960 --> 31:07.120
From behind the door, she missed the corner.

31:07.120 --> 31:08.440
She didn't check her corners.

31:08.440 --> 31:10.960
She carefully opens the doors, checking her corners.

31:10.960 --> 31:13.160
I love trade craft.

31:13.160 --> 31:15.800
Feels so good when it's well used in a game.

31:15.800 --> 31:17.180
Man, that's excellent.

31:17.180 --> 31:19.780
Okay, so because you checked the corners,

31:19.780 --> 31:22.200
you get to see the same thing you would have seen

31:22.200 --> 31:26.620
if you hadn't, which is absolutely nothing different

31:26.620 --> 31:29.940
in this room except for there is a phone

31:29.940 --> 31:32.940
sitting on the kitchen countertop.

31:32.940 --> 31:34.720
Can we clock that it definitely wasn't there

31:34.720 --> 31:36.260
the last time we were in the apartment?

31:36.260 --> 31:39.780
100% it wasn't, but question for Elwood Boyd.

31:39.780 --> 31:42.180
Are you now upstairs or are you hanging out downstairs?

31:42.180 --> 31:45.180
I am standing behind Kevin like he's a human shield.

31:45.180 --> 31:46.020
Okay, perfect.

31:46.060 --> 31:48.260
Literally peeking out from behind it from time to time.

31:48.260 --> 31:50.260
Yes, and your hands went up to prove it.

31:51.900 --> 31:55.380
Are there any security cameras on the property?

31:55.380 --> 31:57.140
No, none that you're aware of.

31:57.140 --> 32:01.320
What if I rolled electrician to see if there is one?

32:01.320 --> 32:02.920
Yeah, okay, go ahead and roll.

32:02.920 --> 32:03.780
It's my craft.

32:03.780 --> 32:04.900
Okay, fantastic.

32:04.900 --> 32:06.280
I love a craft.

32:06.280 --> 32:09.220
Just four young witches learning how to.

32:09.220 --> 32:11.300
There's not any security cameras.

32:11.300 --> 32:12.140
Thomas showed me the craft.

32:12.140 --> 32:14.020
I'd never seen it until Thomas showed me that movie.

32:14.020 --> 32:14.980
A couple of Halloween's ago.

32:15.020 --> 32:15.860
No, yeah, I remember it,

32:15.860 --> 32:17.300
but I think that was the first time I watched it too.

32:17.300 --> 32:18.740
Oh, nice, it was rad.

32:18.740 --> 32:19.580
What's up?

32:19.580 --> 32:24.580
What about a dating show with witches

32:24.760 --> 32:27.200
called Craft American Singles?

32:29.020 --> 32:29.860
Yeah.

32:33.060 --> 32:34.820
The Craft American Singles, but yeah.

32:34.820 --> 32:38.780
It's always good when a show has sponsorship built into it.

32:38.780 --> 32:40.460
Oh yeah, it's paid for already.

32:40.460 --> 32:42.100
Yeah, wait, forget the witches.

32:42.100 --> 32:43.900
Can this just be a cheese dater show?

32:45.100 --> 32:46.660
What kind of cheese do you like?

32:46.660 --> 32:48.040
I only eat craft.

32:50.260 --> 32:51.900
I failed, so there's not any security cameras.

32:51.900 --> 32:53.740
Oh, you failed, okay, sounds good.

32:53.740 --> 32:57.460
No security cameras around to speak of that you know of.

32:57.460 --> 32:59.560
Everything seems to be in the exact same place

32:59.560 --> 33:00.400
where it was left.

33:00.400 --> 33:01.220
No footprints or anything.

33:01.220 --> 33:03.060
Like bloody footprints obviously right there.

33:03.060 --> 33:05.540
No obvious bloody footprints, no.

33:05.540 --> 33:07.300
Can I get this room and ocular pad down?

33:07.300 --> 33:09.780
Absolutely, roll forensics for me.

33:09.780 --> 33:10.620
Eight.

33:10.620 --> 33:13.740
An eight on a forensics check shows that yes,

33:13.740 --> 33:16.380
someone has absolutely been in this apartment.

33:16.380 --> 33:18.060
You can tell because there's now a phone

33:18.060 --> 33:20.100
in the middle of the table.

33:20.100 --> 33:25.100
There's a path of dirt in between the front door

33:27.060 --> 33:29.100
and the kitchen where the phone is.

33:29.100 --> 33:31.380
If I forensic that and get a critical success,

33:31.380 --> 33:32.380
can I Sherlock it?

33:32.380 --> 33:35.460
You would absolutely Sherlock the entire fucking thing.

33:35.460 --> 33:36.300
This is from.

33:41.100 --> 33:42.300
So yeah, I failed.

33:42.300 --> 33:44.820
She leans down and like picks up some of the dirt

33:44.820 --> 33:47.040
and rubs it between her fingers and smells it.

33:47.040 --> 33:48.980
And this person had stepped in dog shit

33:48.980 --> 33:50.180
and she got some dog shit.

33:50.180 --> 33:51.340
Yeah, a hundred percent.

33:51.340 --> 33:53.500
But you know that that dog shit was fresh.

33:53.500 --> 33:56.660
So like this clearly happened in between the time

33:56.660 --> 33:59.740
where you were here earlier and now.

33:59.740 --> 34:02.260
Kevin sees her doing that and is like,

34:02.260 --> 34:03.900
oh, that's maybe I should do that too.

34:03.900 --> 34:05.300
Maybe I should smell the dog shit.

34:05.300 --> 34:08.420
And he like eats a little bit of it.

34:08.420 --> 34:09.260
Yeah.

34:09.260 --> 34:10.080
He's like.

34:10.080 --> 34:10.920
No, no, yeah.

34:10.920 --> 34:11.760
He just nods his head.

34:12.160 --> 34:13.000
No, I hate this.

34:13.000 --> 34:13.840
Yes, keep doing it.

34:13.840 --> 34:17.400
He nods his head in his mind.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.360
He's like, that's definitely dog shit.

34:19.360 --> 34:20.520
I've had that before.

34:20.520 --> 34:21.360
Sure.

34:22.520 --> 34:25.040
But he just nods his head having no idea

34:25.040 --> 34:25.960
what she's thinking.

34:25.960 --> 34:28.440
She gives him the saddest look.

34:29.680 --> 34:31.900
He thinks she's sad because she can't figure out

34:31.900 --> 34:33.400
where the dog shit came from.

34:33.400 --> 34:34.240
Oh.

34:40.720 --> 34:42.200
Four rolls.

34:42.200 --> 34:43.040
What's up guys?

34:43.040 --> 34:46.300
Zach rolled the dice four times and then didn't say anything.

34:46.300 --> 34:50.200
If Elwood feels like the room is empty, do I?

34:50.200 --> 34:51.040
Yep.

34:51.040 --> 34:52.160
I want to go in and go to the phone.

34:52.160 --> 34:54.260
I want to grab the phone and I want to look through it.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.440
Is this a studio?

34:55.440 --> 34:56.280
Yeah.

34:56.280 --> 34:57.120
Okay.

34:57.120 --> 34:57.940
We're in the only room.

34:57.940 --> 34:58.780
You are in the only room.

34:58.780 --> 35:00.960
The only other thing is the bathroom.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.760
There's two doors, closet and bathroom.

35:02.960 --> 35:04.120
Does that dirt trail lead to the bathroom?

35:04.120 --> 35:04.960
Nope.

35:04.960 --> 35:06.080
Does that dirt trail lead to the closet?

35:06.080 --> 35:07.240
Nope.

35:07.240 --> 35:08.540
Does that dirt trail lead to the phone

35:08.540 --> 35:09.380
and then back out the door?

35:09.380 --> 35:10.220
Yep.

35:10.220 --> 35:11.040
Okay.

35:11.040 --> 35:13.100
This dirt trail leads out the floor.

35:15.880 --> 35:18.280
This dirt trail leads to the door and out and...

35:20.520 --> 35:22.360
This dirt trail leads to the door after it leads

35:22.360 --> 35:26.320
to the phone, which it led to from the door.

35:26.320 --> 35:28.880
It's actually dog shit, not dirt.

35:30.320 --> 35:31.160
I know.

35:32.160 --> 35:33.000
Me too.

35:33.880 --> 35:34.720
Yeah, I know too.

35:34.720 --> 35:35.880
I saw, yeah.

35:35.880 --> 35:37.200
Maybe he has a...

35:37.200 --> 35:38.040
Does that...

35:38.040 --> 35:38.880
Alvin?

35:38.880 --> 35:40.480
What's his fucking name?

35:40.480 --> 35:41.320
Arvin.

35:41.320 --> 35:42.140
Arvin.

35:42.140 --> 35:42.980
Arvin.

35:42.980 --> 35:44.800
But I thought his name was Alvin last episode too.

35:44.800 --> 35:45.640
Arvin!

35:48.480 --> 35:50.200
Does Arvin have a dog?

35:50.200 --> 35:53.240
I have a feeling it's probably just an environmental hazard.

35:53.240 --> 35:54.080
Okay.

35:54.080 --> 35:55.680
Have you ever stepped in dog shit?

35:55.680 --> 35:57.320
No.

35:57.320 --> 35:58.160
Well, I have.

35:58.160 --> 35:59.240
I was never trying to.

35:59.240 --> 36:03.440
Whoa, what a weird way to answer that question.

36:03.440 --> 36:04.280
I just assumed.

36:04.280 --> 36:05.200
He didn't want to be embarrassed.

36:05.200 --> 36:08.000
Yeah, she's like, who steps in dog shit?

36:08.000 --> 36:10.360
I don't step in dog shit.

36:10.360 --> 36:12.240
It's okay, everybody steps in it sometimes.

36:12.240 --> 36:13.080
You don't know.

36:13.080 --> 36:13.900
A lot.

36:13.900 --> 36:14.740
Some people even say it's good luck.

36:14.740 --> 36:15.760
A lot, I'm lucky.

36:15.760 --> 36:17.640
Yeah, because after you stepped in dog shit,

36:17.640 --> 36:19.520
what's the worst thing that could happen to you that day?

36:19.520 --> 36:21.000
You get it in your mouth.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.700
Yeah, you did that.

36:22.700 --> 36:24.120
You did that.

36:24.120 --> 36:25.140
But that happened before.

36:25.140 --> 36:26.720
You haven't stepped in any of it yet.

36:26.720 --> 36:27.560
No.

36:27.560 --> 36:28.480
So there you go.

36:28.560 --> 36:29.960
Once you've stepped in it,

36:29.960 --> 36:31.680
probably nothing worse will happen

36:31.680 --> 36:34.000
than putting that shit in your mouth.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.300
What kind of phone is it?

36:35.300 --> 36:36.140
Good talk.

36:36.140 --> 36:37.560
I watched a trailer today.

36:37.560 --> 36:38.960
Quick trailer alert.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.280
Trailer alert!

36:40.280 --> 36:42.000
You guys know how we do trailer alerts?

36:42.000 --> 36:44.080
Yeah, classic trailer alert.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.360
Stop trying to make trailer alerts a thing.

36:45.360 --> 36:46.520
Trailer alert!

36:47.800 --> 36:51.320
We watched a trailer for a Netflix Christmas movie today

36:51.320 --> 36:53.620
with the guy from Crazy Rich Asians

36:53.620 --> 36:56.840
and the blonde girl from Game of Thrones.

36:56.840 --> 36:57.680
And-

36:58.080 --> 37:02.200
They, she, a bird shits in her eye.

37:02.200 --> 37:03.040
Nice.

37:03.040 --> 37:03.880
And she fucking dies.

37:03.880 --> 37:06.220
And he tells her it's good luck.

37:06.220 --> 37:08.680
And she's like, what?

37:08.680 --> 37:09.520
That's-

37:09.520 --> 37:10.740
And he's like, do you want to go out with me?

37:10.740 --> 37:11.740
And she's like, no.

37:13.440 --> 37:14.280
Yeah.

37:15.200 --> 37:16.240
Dog shit I get.

37:16.240 --> 37:17.080
If a bird shits in your eye-

37:17.080 --> 37:20.040
A bird shit in her eye and they show it in the trailer

37:20.040 --> 37:24.240
of like the goop hitting, which now, uh oh, side story.

37:24.240 --> 37:27.200
I saw Kings of Leon perform after the-

37:28.200 --> 37:29.040
In a bird shit in your eye?

37:29.040 --> 37:30.480
I think you told this on the pod already.

37:30.480 --> 37:31.320
Have I?

37:31.320 --> 37:32.640
Oh, okay, then I won't tell it again.

37:32.640 --> 37:33.960
But when I saw Kings of Leon,

37:33.960 --> 37:38.440
they played outside in a bird shit in the bassist's mouth.

37:38.440 --> 37:42.580
And they shut down the show after three songs.

37:42.580 --> 37:43.640
I remember that was in the news

37:43.640 --> 37:44.860
when it happened because of that.

37:44.860 --> 37:46.880
Okay, they opened with Closer,

37:46.880 --> 37:49.200
which is the first song off Only By The Night.

37:49.200 --> 37:52.520
And then they played the next song off Only By The Night,

37:52.520 --> 37:55.360
which is Crawl, which is a fucking jam.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.620
And then they played Taper Jean Girl,

37:57.620 --> 38:00.200
which was fucking rad.

38:00.200 --> 38:03.560
And so I heard the only three songs I like

38:03.560 --> 38:08.200
by Kings of Leon and during the third one, a bird strip.

38:08.200 --> 38:11.960
I watched the shit fall down from the rafters

38:11.960 --> 38:14.840
and the bassist looked up at just the wrong time

38:14.840 --> 38:17.240
and it landed directly in his mouth.

38:17.240 --> 38:21.920
He ripped his bass off of himself and walked off stage.

38:22.160 --> 38:24.600
And then they finished the song and left.

38:24.600 --> 38:26.020
That's so lame.

38:26.020 --> 38:27.880
Listen, I don't know how much shit

38:27.880 --> 38:29.400
went how far down his throat.

38:29.400 --> 38:33.800
I can imagine a scenario in which I need to stop the show.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.360
But I think in most scenarios,

38:35.360 --> 38:37.040
if a bird shit in your mouth,

38:37.040 --> 38:38.920
you fucking wash that shit out.

38:38.920 --> 38:39.760
You take a minute.

38:39.760 --> 38:40.600
You take a minute and you go to bed.

38:40.600 --> 38:42.880
You take a minute and then you go play a kick ass rock show.

38:42.880 --> 38:45.280
It was made exponentially better

38:45.280 --> 38:49.760
because Justin Bieber broke his leg on stage

38:49.760 --> 38:51.120
and finished the show.

38:51.160 --> 38:53.840
Justin Bieber just out rockstar'd you.

38:53.840 --> 38:55.920
Yeah, and they're like.

38:55.920 --> 38:56.760
He's a pop star.

38:56.760 --> 38:59.880
They're like, we're southern whiskey drinking boys.

38:59.880 --> 39:00.840
Is that their deal?

39:00.840 --> 39:01.660
Yeah.

39:01.660 --> 39:02.500
I thought that the deal was

39:02.500 --> 39:03.340
that they were vaguely Christian.

39:03.340 --> 39:06.000
Their dad was like a tent preacher or something.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.240
We should get back to the episode.

39:07.240 --> 39:12.240
So there is a phone sitting on the kitchen countertop.

39:12.840 --> 39:14.040
I wanna pick it up and look through it.

39:14.040 --> 39:14.860
Yeah, of course.

39:14.860 --> 39:18.280
It matches all the incoming and outgoing phone calls

39:18.320 --> 39:20.200
that you would recognize from the log

39:20.200 --> 39:23.000
that you got from the FBI.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.720
I wanna check text messages.

39:24.720 --> 39:26.420
Yeah, when you go into text messages,

39:26.420 --> 39:29.240
there are very few and far between.

39:29.240 --> 39:32.460
It seems that Chilton was not much of a texter.

39:32.460 --> 39:34.840
Can I look for correspondence with his ex-wife

39:34.840 --> 39:36.720
before that phone call that she received

39:36.720 --> 39:37.960
a few days before she died?

39:37.960 --> 39:41.960
It had been a long time since he had called her, yeah.

39:41.960 --> 39:42.920
Is there a role I can do

39:42.920 --> 39:44.880
to make sure I'm not missing anything in this phone?

39:44.880 --> 39:46.020
What do you wanna roll for that?

39:46.020 --> 39:47.120
I'll do it too.

39:47.120 --> 39:48.480
That's an eight on SIGINT.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.100
Oh dude, hell yeah.

39:50.100 --> 39:53.560
So, cause you rolled SIGINT and I love that skill

39:53.560 --> 39:55.720
and we never use it,

39:55.720 --> 39:57.920
if you go through the photos

39:57.920 --> 40:00.840
and you start scrolling through,

40:00.840 --> 40:05.840
you're gonna realize that each panel of like nine photos,

40:07.080 --> 40:12.080
the top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right,

40:12.160 --> 40:16.720
remind you strangely of like the points

40:16.720 --> 40:18.680
of that weird pentagram thing.

40:18.680 --> 40:19.520
The flesh pentagram.

40:19.520 --> 40:20.360
The Vitruvian man pentagram.

40:20.360 --> 40:22.480
Yeah, that you saw earlier.

40:22.480 --> 40:23.600
And all the nudes remind us

40:23.600 --> 40:26.120
of the testament of the nude flesh.

40:26.120 --> 40:26.960
Pfft.

40:26.960 --> 40:27.800
Mm-hmm.

40:27.800 --> 40:28.840
Mm-hmm.

40:28.840 --> 40:30.000
That really got me.

40:30.000 --> 40:30.840
It did.

40:30.840 --> 40:33.080
I felt like I stole something.

40:33.080 --> 40:34.680
Like that wasn't that good.

40:34.680 --> 40:35.520
Mm-hmm.

40:37.200 --> 40:40.400
Arvin Chilton, or whoever was using this phone,

40:40.400 --> 40:44.280
is clearly involved with

40:44.280 --> 40:45.960
the testament of the nude flesh.

40:45.960 --> 40:46.800
Thank you.

40:46.800 --> 40:51.400
Maybe we, you should Google the new flesh

40:51.400 --> 40:55.560
and see if we can join in quotation words.

40:55.560 --> 40:56.480
While I'm holding this phone,

40:56.480 --> 40:58.920
can I just Google that, the testament of the new flesh?

40:58.920 --> 41:01.960
When you go to Google the testament of the new flesh

41:01.960 --> 41:03.800
and it autofills.

41:03.800 --> 41:04.640
Autofills, sure.

41:06.520 --> 41:09.080
Autofilled, he's been looking it up himself.

41:09.080 --> 41:10.400
Have you seen these pictures here?

41:10.400 --> 41:13.320
He's even like doing the diagram in his photos.

41:13.320 --> 41:14.560
He knows something.

41:14.560 --> 41:17.040
He's part of this group, I think.

41:17.040 --> 41:19.880
Seeing that pattern that they've seen in the photos,

41:19.880 --> 41:22.960
she asks Elwood, if you go to the call logs,

41:22.960 --> 41:26.480
are there any numbers, new numbers that start appearing

41:26.480 --> 41:29.640
around the same time as that photo pattern?

41:29.640 --> 41:31.040
Let me see here.

41:31.040 --> 41:34.040
It looks like there's, yeah, there's one here

41:34.040 --> 41:37.560
that he hadn't called before, the 20th.

41:37.560 --> 41:39.440
Yeah, it's a new one to him.

41:39.440 --> 41:40.920
When did he last call it?

41:40.920 --> 41:41.960
I wonder when he last called it.

41:41.960 --> 41:42.800
23rd.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.880
Click on the info and it says the 23rd.

41:44.880 --> 41:48.240
That was the day, three days after the deaths?

41:48.240 --> 41:49.080
Two days after the deaths.

41:49.080 --> 41:50.400
Two days after the initial deaths,

41:50.400 --> 41:52.720
but the same day as the gas station death.

41:52.720 --> 41:54.440
Yeah, what time is the call

41:54.440 --> 41:55.840
in relation to the gas station death?

41:55.840 --> 41:56.840
Earlier.

41:56.840 --> 41:58.020
Okay.

41:58.020 --> 42:01.240
And the date of the first phone call?

42:01.240 --> 42:02.320
The day before.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.960
So the day after the McCarty's were murdered

42:05.000 --> 42:08.520
and then the day that the gas station attendant,

42:08.520 --> 42:10.240
Quentin Harris was murdered.

42:10.240 --> 42:12.240
But before the murder occurred.

42:12.240 --> 42:14.120
But before that Quentin Harris murder.

42:14.120 --> 42:17.480
And this is just like a phone number, not a saved contact.

42:17.480 --> 42:18.320
It doesn't say like.

42:18.320 --> 42:19.160
Not a saved contact.

42:19.160 --> 42:20.160
Cool cult number.

42:20.160 --> 42:22.080
It does not say cool cult number.

42:22.080 --> 42:24.640
Is the area code the same like Ocean City?

42:24.640 --> 42:25.480
Great question.

42:25.480 --> 42:29.800
It is, it is not an Ocean City number.

42:29.800 --> 42:31.600
Is it like a New York City number?

42:31.600 --> 42:33.360
It's Newark, baby.

42:33.360 --> 42:34.200
Newark.

42:34.280 --> 42:35.480
No, sorry, shit.

42:36.480 --> 42:37.400
Am I dumb?

42:37.400 --> 42:39.540
Do you not know your nation's area codes?

42:41.280 --> 42:43.280
It's 417 and Zach made the call.

42:43.280 --> 42:45.080
No, I'm sorry, it's Newark.

42:45.080 --> 42:46.920
And is there a duration listed

42:46.920 --> 42:48.440
for how long these calls lasted?

42:48.440 --> 42:52.560
The first one is two and a half minutes

42:52.560 --> 42:54.740
and the second one is 30 seconds.

42:58.080 --> 42:59.480
Oh, okay.

42:59.720 --> 43:00.560
Oh.

43:03.480 --> 43:04.800
Zach's rolling and laughing.

43:04.800 --> 43:05.640
Four times.

43:06.520 --> 43:07.360
Oh my God.

43:07.360 --> 43:09.320
Again for the second time.

43:09.320 --> 43:10.700
Everybody roll alertness.

43:12.760 --> 43:13.600
94.

43:15.360 --> 43:16.200
Four.

43:16.200 --> 43:17.480
I pass with a 14.

43:17.480 --> 43:21.740
It is raining outside.

43:21.740 --> 43:23.480
The highest success was a 14?

43:23.480 --> 43:24.880
Yeah, it's raining outside.

43:29.480 --> 43:34.160
It's like I'm on the last bend of the deep end

43:34.160 --> 43:38.000
but the drowning's been just fine.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.320
And when my ears pop and the shell shock

43:42.320 --> 43:46.280
of this pit stop frees my mind.

43:46.280 --> 43:48.360
I'll be all right.

43:48.360 --> 43:53.360
I can go there now that I stare death in the face.

43:54.440 --> 43:56.520
I'll be all right.

43:56.520 --> 44:01.520
I can go there now that I stare death in the face.

44:18.840 --> 44:23.840
Doesn't it always seem like the parts that made us laugh

44:24.480 --> 44:25.800
now make us cry?

44:27.040 --> 44:30.840
Doesn't it always seem like the villain

44:30.840 --> 44:34.240
pulling the strings is a regular guy?

44:35.440 --> 44:40.440
You and me have gone bad in a good way, I promise.

44:43.480 --> 44:48.480
Kerosene wipes clean what we couldn't bear to tarnish.

44:48.480 --> 44:49.480
I'll be all right.

44:49.480 --> 44:54.480
I can go there now that I stare death in the face.

44:55.480 --> 44:57.480
I'll be all right.

44:57.480 --> 45:02.480
I can go there now that I stare death in the face.

45:18.480 --> 45:23.480
I can go there now that I stare death in the face.

45:40.480 --> 45:45.480
There's a conundrum in the wisdom of my spirit.

45:46.480 --> 45:50.480
White washed hymns and the deadliest sins

45:50.480 --> 45:52.480
push me to my limit.

45:54.480 --> 45:57.480
But when you deconstruct

45:57.480 --> 46:01.480
you're shit out of luck for a minute.

46:02.480 --> 46:09.480
After the last bend you can break it all down to rebuild it.

46:15.480 --> 46:35.480
You and me have gone bad in a good way, I promise.

46:37.480 --> 46:43.480
You and me have gone bad in a good way, I promise.

46:45.480 --> 46:47.480
I'll be all right.

46:47.480 --> 46:53.480
I can go there now that I stare death in the face.

46:53.480 --> 46:55.480
I'll be all right.

46:55.480 --> 47:01.480
I can go there now that I stare death in the face.
