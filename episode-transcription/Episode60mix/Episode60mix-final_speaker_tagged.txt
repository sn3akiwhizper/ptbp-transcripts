0.00 218.32 speaker0  what's up my babies it's your stepdad's stepson wolf wolf the dog's dog taking over the airwaves here on 694.2 PTBP due to a frankly terrifying display of holiday cheer aka wolf the dog gargled down more steaming mollusks swapped than the rest of family combined in our semi-annual chowder challenge oh wolf is in the dumpster and he's breathing but it's real high-pitched now it is something to do called howling with wolf so how does the man who drives the snow plow get real help my fake dad out talk about app pretending part on the internet and give them money on patreon sometimes people write five star reviews on the apple podcast app and he gets so happy because he feels validated and understood and that means a lot to dogs like wolf now put down the booze and listen for clues it's time for the news last time Leon told Clark that he would become the overseer go back in time and start the circle of knowledge Leon split the party tried to shoot Clark with a dart gun got fucked by Joel's uncanny ability to quit and then Leon Clark came to an understanding fulfilling their original plan the two headed over to the administration building where they heard numbers coming from a voice at the end of a dark hallway Keith and John went to Harriet Mox's dorm John last touched again and focused on the Bruce Robin numbers while Keith scoured Harriet's room for clues turns out Harriet's roommate Amelia thinks the suicide story is fishy and Harriet was on search for two things the most corrupt corporation in the city and the overseer and now to the middle of a party timed holiday themed storyline even when Clark is being a dick it's a track that makes my ball drop welcome to 2020 motherfuckers it's kazoo with no back
209.68 308.88 speaker1  come up on them you see that one is very short and very slight in stature and also slender and the small one is uh jumping up and poking at the other figure who is played by Justin he's just like oh come on please hit me god please just hit me in the face i'm gonna i'm gonna need one of the walls nearby and just starts like slamming his head into the wall oh jesus and
301.12 336.56 speaker2  looking freshman in college and i look to be in my early 20s let's say let's say and then it's true
328.72 426.64 speaker1  like hanging over uh these windows looking into the office and the banner says at the end of the 10th day my true love had given me blank gifts and it's uh capital g i f f s and leon looks up at it and he's like oh the administration office it's right there is the banner handwritten no no is this door i'm just gonna check and walks over and the administration office is unlocked so leon just like opens the door and turns back and he's like oh come on come on please just like one good
421.20 510.24 speaker2  friend acting so it's crazy like that i just stare back at the sign again completely ignoring
503.60 524.40 speaker3  me did you know him before just i have no idea who this person was well all right but i thank you from the bottom of my heart for striking him multiple times you're not thinking of
519.20 636.48 speaker1  of numbers at all and you guys look down and you see like leon had flipped on the lights in the office when the lights come on you see that the walls of the hallway and the office are just covered in numbers oh shit the entire inner workings of this building have just been like chalk sharpie pen blood semen everything just like yeah semen and then everything have been used to write numbers all over these walls and the floor and the ceiling i don't remember huh and then he like literally looks to the bottom right of the banner and there
629.52 725.60 speaker2  at that banner that's just uh that's just the number plus them all so if it's the 10th day it's 10 gifts and the day before that they would have gotten nine just add them all up i think it's have a you have a pleasant pleasant day sir can you tell me what that number was again i've hi if leon's correct the number would be a lot higher and i don't have the time to do the math right now on it which seems like an outrageous number of presence and i thought the first number
719.20 833.52 speaker1  and he walks into the office uh with the lights on you see that the everything in this office is covered in numbers uh the desks the chairs like anything that people could possibly write on are covered in these numbers and he walks over to a computer weirdly enough there's just one main computer in this office space and there is a monitor and keyboard normal computer stuff leon looks at it and is like all right well i guess let's boot it up and there's a passcode you see that there are pictures sitting at this desk of a woman she seems to be in her early donovan west haven and you see that the pictures are with trophies from scavenger hunt championships with this person holding trophies up and you see the name engraved on the trophies r a ever and they're all holding up a sign that says third floor gifts house which is g i f f s
828.64 906.08 speaker2  it does not work i'm gonna try amelia it does not work i'm gonna try amelia lock
900.24 958.40 speaker1  outside with donovan in the hallway from the vantage of inside the office you see that there's actually some stuff printed on the back of the banner is a map of campus and the four dorm have their names listed and the dorms are called maymay house tinder's house redight house and
952.96 1113.04 speaker2  the gifs the gifs house that's if you want to find amelia i think there's a red spot are we gonna we're gonna solve this uh scavenger hunt then okay calm down clark you just see important mean i think mine's correct but if you think that she's giving all those presents every day let's go
1105.84 1144.80 speaker1  to gifts house unobstructed and when you get in there you see there's a little secretary desk on the right and the sitting area on the left with a baby grand piano and then ahead of you there is a
1138.48 1214.16 speaker2  leon hey leon you want to check on that and clark is going to go like to is there a staircase in that's beautiful i i failed also not a crit though perfect well uh as you're just like
1208.40 1273.60 speaker1  bigger hallway that leads to the stairwell and the light comes on you see that the walls on either side of you are just covered in these numbers and like there's some sigils posted up now and it's just some sigils sigils yeah and it's all written in the same just like varying materials as soon as the lights come on you just hear from a door in this hallway there are three
1268.72 1307.84 speaker2  back this way this let's stay away from that uh that area there real fast i think that's a good something real bad here and those numbers might be infectious so if you hear numbers you might close your ears or maybe don't look at them i'm not sure how it works hey leon you know how this
1300.64 1366.40 speaker1  he points at the computer screen and he's pulled up the room number for amelia lock amelia lock she lives in 328 gifts house and her roommate is harriet marks ah it's all coming together uh the glint of the uh computer screen kind of shines over there enough for you to make out a pool table in that room you assume it's some sort of entertainment or games room there's probably i'm already fucked well that's why we're here right to fix what happened to you i mean i feel
1362.96 1385.52 speaker2  here maybe maybe since i've already done the numbers thing and you snapped me out of it you
1379.84 1417.68 speaker3  shouting numbers at me constantly it's really annoying actually i don't do you have blackouts
1413.04 1441.36 speaker2  dehumanize you because you might be an antidote of some sort that we need your blood or oh my god
1434.72 1485.04 speaker3  staring at his phone like swiping through whatever social media exists in this universe completely
1478.08 1849.76 speaker1  into the stairwell it's also pitch black and it is lit up a little red with the exit sign right thomas i have good news and bad news just give me the good news then okay the good news is it's years releasing for a year and we've made it all the way from december 1st to december 6th what a tell you the bad news okay john lee pettimore is gaining a new mania and it is going to completely engross him oh he didn't reach his breaking point i know he didn't but it's a part of a mechanic for this arc that this mania will absolutely dominate every other mania that you've had before and every so you're going to roll three d 100s and we'll look at the list and see what you got 99 whoa jesus all right so 94 is theomania belief that he or she is a god something older than me older than john lee pettymore himself the end of december and the beginning of january or mostly the in between therefore of the two situations with which we call calendar months within a year into the next one but i was words i say justin i'm sorry zack when i was a kid we used to listen to a song uh when we were hanging out the ornaments on the tree we'd always listen to christmas music and one of our favorites was a muppet christmas carol soundtrack to that movie it was great but my personal favorite growing up was a song by john denver this isn't a joke this is just true and now every time i hear it i can only so when i when i heard the song as a child i could always immediately visualize john denver's face wherever he was in the world but now i just see his rotting listening to that song you just think of this instead luke is just handed oh my god dude stop
1844.40 1922.96 speaker2  other than the normal like christmas morning stuff that i absolutely love we have a weird tradition in the family that christmas eve we do a frozen pizza and oyster soup that is interesting like not wanting to cook the night before christmas okay and then i think my dad maybe fancy oyster soup that my dad makes and it's great great great and it's really weird to have them suppers with a bunch of people that i've done since i was a voice changer when you said that
1917.60 1954.88 speaker3  who immigrated from argentina in argentina it's like a ton of italian food so they just uh
1952.80 2006.40 speaker4  oh and then we drink mimosas yeah it's a lot of fun that's awesome we get sloshed and we eat cinnamon rolls and eggs benedict
1997.20 2087.20 speaker1  you guys are all standing in different places so clark bishop and donovan westerfuck are walking down the hallway of the third floor of the gifts building gifts house as you're walking down that hallway you see that the light is on in one of the rooms down the hallway and looking at the numbers you would see like oh that that might actually be the one that we're looking for the
2086.72 2116.56 speaker4  immense
2110.40 2129.44 speaker1  notice that they are with a third person so keith vigna and john lee pennymore you are seeing
2123.60 2199.52 speaker3  six foot one six foot two somewhere in between those two inches dark nice hair done up really nice and he has like a let's see he's like a button-up buttoned all the way up tucked in
2195.12 2263.04 speaker2  that he might be immune to the the infection of the numbers he said he's been having people had another fellow with him who was asking to be punched in the face and then he started saying
2258.08 2273.52 speaker1  covered in these numbers as was the hallway on the way down the floor the ceiling all over the desk
2268.32 2302.00 speaker2  the uh method of infection but he puts on headphones every now and then just to maybe
2297.20 2322.80 speaker4  there and i point to amelia's desk take a look at those trophies i do you would see that they
2316.64 2456.64 speaker2  these trophies here um there was also a clue back at those offices i assume maybe the first leg he has to stand on is that she does say on the fifth day christmas my true love
2449.28 2489.92 speaker1  up a sheet and on the back of the sheet is all the math of like one plus three plus you know essentially uh fibonacci sequence but not right for this thing and it leads to 330 which is the room across the hall which keith vigno would then say i found this in there
2481.04 2516.48 speaker4  of paper that has a picture like in cartoon form a picture of seven eggs a golf ball a cat a demon we found out it's a like a staging dorm room that nobody lives in it's just to show prospective students what a dorm room looks like i found this in there and there's a casio keyboard in there
2511.52 2591.76 speaker1  anything to me either but i can tell you whoever made this riddle seems very cool small enough to be sent in text form though does that make it an emoji no man oh okay then no
2587.04 2622.64 speaker4  to probably go check that room out but uh in harriet's desk she has a to-do list number one research the most unethical corporation in the city and number two i found and basically says she didn't think that harriet would have committed suicide and that
2617.20 2728.32 speaker2  we were thinking that maybe it was a uh a leaping disease that went from one person to the next and he wrote down their names and yada yada if harriet killed herself first then amelia would have maybe gotten it or gotten it in investigating her death that could be have whatever m is next what about her last name just lock can't find it anywhere okay yeah i'm just not sure if our if our theory is wrong or something else happened in the sequence of
2718.48 2967.68 speaker1  the hall into 330 you would find this dorm room set up to be the pinnacle of what all dorm rooms much like this dorm room that is very well equipped with lots of blankets and pillows and athleisure which is what the college kids wearing these days bad commercial for csu but uh you would hard to make out the sequences just like everywhere else however in the middle of this room there is just a casio keyboard sitting there it's turned on and there's a music stand that is now empty i'd like to play the keyboard cat riff oh you do it can you do it that keyboard does not have an outboard audio on it but we could pause and go to the piano real quick i'd like to hear it let's take a pause and go to the upright piano real quick hands all together just doing it like the cat did on the keyboard as you play the jingle bells tune gifts house you see the bell tower on the csu campus lit up in all its holiday festive glory are there wreaths dude you have no idea how many wreaths there are you can't count them are there come on down and join us for your next semester of fun and fall festivities that can take you all the way from the jingle ball to a new hall of your new office which is where you work now because you've got a college degree and it's america which is all you need to work in the streaming
