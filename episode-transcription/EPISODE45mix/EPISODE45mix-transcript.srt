00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
Hello to all my friends, my enemies, people in extra dimensional beards who feel neutral

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,800
about my existence, yall know everyone feels nothing but intense love for wolf the dog

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:24,120
which is my name, PTBP which is my radio station, and 694.2 which is my favorite grouping of

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,880
numbers to broadcast on, I'm here to love you as you have loved me and bring you some

5
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,880
tasty, tasty information.

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,680
But first, this week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Mia who tagged that pretending

7
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,820
pod on one of them there tweets, thanks for sharing the show with your friends Mia, she

8
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,820
writes

9
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:51,400
Greetings, the ladies sewing and seance circle would like to remind everyone that our annual

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,920
bake sale and dumpster dive are still on for next Friday, the time and location will

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,120
be on your bathroom Mia when you get out of the shower tomorrow, thanks for passing that

12
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,320
on Mr. the dog, thanks Mia.

13
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:12,340
It's good to know the LSSC is still running real strong and generally somehow managing

14
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:18,040
to both creep everyone out and bore them to death simultaneously, but the trick is on

15
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:24,120
y'all I don't have a mirror or a bathroom unless you count the streets of the city that

16
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,120
is.

17
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,720
Remember, if you want to write up something for your wolf to howl, tag at pretending pod

18
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,920
on Instagram or Twitter, tag pretended to be people on Facebook, or write a 5 star review

19
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,800
on iTunes and email us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.

20
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,640
If more of your friends listen to the show, you'll have even more stuff to talk about

21
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:50,680
that completely alienates y'all from the normals and here at 694.2, well we think that's

22
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,280
just swell.

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:59,160
Also the contest happening over on the subreddit ends at 11.59pm central time on September

24
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:05,640
23rd, if you are listening to this on September 23rd that means it's all over tonight baby,

25
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,440
get cracka lacking my pups.

26
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,680
All entries have a shot at winning a D&D 5 edition starter set and the winner will receive

27
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,100
a hardback slip case set of Delta Green the Role Playing Game.

28
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,480
The winners will be announced next week on episode 46.

29
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,120
Speaking of pretending to be people, it's time for the news.

30
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,840
Last time, a whole lot of plot developed just in time for the main event.

31
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,520
Get ready y'all, for real, cause this shit, this shit is popping off like beef stroking

32
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
off.

33
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,880
Going strong like Dijon, other food references.

34
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,160
Are you ready?

35
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,800
Because taking us now to the scrap pit is kudzu baby with no back bone.

36
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:20,640
Y'all ready for this?

37
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,000
Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, and Oz Mayhem Wolf walk up the stairs and into the lights and

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,280
sounds of the arena.

39
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,720
This colossal room is circular and funnels downward at least 10 stories.

40
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,480
There are thousands of seats surrounding a massive covered cage.

41
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,440
Think the Octagon from UFC but it's 50 yards across and has a bubble looking rounded top

42
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,880
on it that is entirely made of a crystal clear material.

43
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:58,980
Aggressively loud dubstep is blaring, strobe lights are making the entire experience otherworldly

44
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,360
as green and red and blue lasers swing wildly around the room.

45
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,940
This place feels like futuristic Las Vegas filled with the spirit of all of Vin Diesel's

46
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,360
films if they were tarred and feathered, but the tar is replaced by Red Bull and the feathers

47
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,400
are replaced by cocaine.

48
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:23,720
There's an enormous logo in the center of the arena floor that says in all caps, the

49
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,660
scrap pit.

50
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:32,680
And all around the scrap pit in a massive circle are the repeated words, planet juggernaut,

51
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:39,240
hanging above the bubble is a gigantic circular jumbotron showing a countdown timer blinking

52
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:47,340
away and flashing the words, Oz Mayhem Wolf and Friends vs Planet Juggernaut.

53
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:54,280
The music lowers just a bit and a voice says, welcome one and all to a night you will never

54
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:01,320
forget a fight that'll make you lose your shit alright because nothing is ever left

55
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,640
in the scrap pit.

56
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:09,840
I am your host and emcee for the evening, Nick Nichols, and as always, I am joined by

57
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,840
my brother.

58
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,240
Hey everybody, it's me, Nick Nichols, here with my brother, Nick Nichols.

59
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,800
I'm Nick Nichols, joined by my brother, Nick.

60
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,020
Welcome to the scrap pit, we've got a hell of a show for you this evening.

61
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,100
What do you think, Nick?

62
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,520
It is an honor and a pleasure to see such bloodsport on a beautiful sunny day in the

63
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,520
city.

64
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,740
A vast circle in the floor in the arena opens up and from below, planet juggernaut slowly

65
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,600
raises into the scrap pit.

66
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,900
Thomas raises his hands in the air.

67
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,640
The amphitheater explodes with noise, cheers, boos, fucked up people just screaming their

68
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:54,520
lungs out and this thing is a shiny metal sphere 20 feet tall with two metallic arms

69
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,280
extending from either side and Thomas just slammed his fist together which is what he

70
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,980
described doing when he went into the machine but here's the catch, Thomas, you've never

71
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:11,640
been a planet juggernaut before and I want to give Justin a reason to roll some dice.

72
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:20,200
So, Justin is going to roll a D100 and in order for you to control your body that you're

73
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,240
now in, you have to roll under whatever he rolls.

74
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,240
Now you don't have to do this every round, you just have to do this until you succeed

75
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,900
and then you're fully in control but it might take a couple rounds for you to get used to

76
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,800
this new body or you might be a notch.

77
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,840
You might be a notch-ral.

78
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,120
You might, you might be a prodigy.

79
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,960
Alright, roll me bitch.

80
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,420
Justin, go ahead and roll, let's see what Thomas has to roll underneath to slam his

81
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,420
arms together.

82
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,420
That's a 50.

83
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,440
We got a straight up 50-50 shot here.

84
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
64.

85
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:00,240
In Planet Juggernaut, his arms are like outstretched in a very awkward way and one of them goes

86
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,800
to swing at the other one to pound its fist into the hand and misses completely, therefore

87
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
hugging itself.

88
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,440
Clark Bishop, regardless of whether or not you think this robot should be hugging itself

89
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:20,120
or slamming its fist together, you are in a Colosseum dome fighting pit against a 20-foot

90
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
tall robot.

91
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,720
I need you to roll a sanity.

92
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,440
Keith Vigna, you are already gonzo beans.

93
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,640
I am gonzo beans, baby.

94
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,040
I fail and above my power.

95
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,880
Alright, that is really handy.

96
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,000
I need you to roll a d6.

97
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
A 1.

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You lose one sanity.

99
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I hit my breaking point.

100
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,960
You hit your breaking point.

101
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,960
So fun thing for a breaking point, this late in the game we're going to give you another

102
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,400
mania from the sample mania's table in the Call of Cthulhu 7th edition rulebook.

103
00:07:53,400 --> 00:08:02,000
So I'm going to have you roll three times and we will choose which mania you will take.

104
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,160
A 93, a 19, and an 8.

105
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:16,960
Alright, 93 is Thanatomania, which is a belief that one is cursed by death magic.

106
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,640
That belief does not seem irrational.

107
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:27,800
19 is Bibliomania, the obsession with books and or reading.

108
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Also extremely fitting, but perhaps not in this current state.

109
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:40,700
And number 8 is spelled A-I-L-U-R-O mania, so I'm going to go with aileromania, which

110
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,880
is the abnormal fondness for cats.

111
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,720
Gosh, I wish I would have got that one earlier.

112
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,160
Old Doug Jacobs would have had a field day.

113
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,560
I'm going to go with the cursed death magic.

114
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:06,120
I just pictured you and Doug Jacobs doing a three-legged race, or doing one of the hop

115
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,000
like when you wear a potato sack.

116
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What's that called?

117
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
A three-legged race.

118
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,560
That's a potato sack race.

119
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,880
Yeah, three-legged race is where you tie your middle two legs together.

120
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,760
They were really on the nose with those names when they came up with those, so you chose

121
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,400
which one?

122
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,920
That he thinks he's cursed by death magic.

123
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,920
Yeah, of course.

124
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,240
That absolutely makes sense.

125
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:31,360
So you are now, believe yourself to A, be god, A god, B, be cursed by death magic, which

126
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,800
has got to be a rough thing for a god to feel, and 3, you rolled over your power.

127
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:47,000
And my guess is you are a lot closer to Keith Vigna and Oz Mayhem Wolf than you are to Planet

128
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Juggernaut.

129
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,800
As the round begins, round one, it is your turn.

130
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,080
This fight's going to end without Thomas rolling a die.

131
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,280
I just murder all the people around me.

132
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:04,880
Yeah, because of the sanity thing, I'm going to have to dive at whichever one's closest.

133
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,280
Let's roll a 50-50 shot here.

134
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,480
I'll roll a D100 and I'll be under 50.

135
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
Perfect.

136
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,640
84, so I'm going after Oz.

137
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,240
So Clark is dressed from the room.

138
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:25,000
He picked up a bomb squad suit, the suits that are really heavily padded with a helmet

139
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
and everything.

140
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He's wearing that.

141
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,040
But he also picked up these pneumatic gloves.

142
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,800
So think Batman, I think, in one of the Dark Knights had them.

143
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,800
Absolutely.

144
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,880
He's going against his forearm strength and finger grip strength, and he's just going

145
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,720
to lunge straight at Oz, and he's going to try and maybe rip his head off.

146
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:50,020
Okay, Oz is going to roll Awareness to see if he's ready for this attack, and he's not.

147
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,520
So he's not going to roll against you.

148
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,080
You just get to roll an attack on Oz Mayhem Wolf.

149
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,240
So go ahead and roll, what would you call that, unarmed combat?

150
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,640
That was the plan when I decided on one of those gloves, yeah.

151
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,200
I'm guessing you have a higher unarmed combat than you do have a melee, is that correct?

152
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Correct to my name.

153
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Alright, well.

154
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,880
Let's see what that roll is.

155
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,600
That's a zero zero three.

156
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,480
Holy shit, that's a success?

157
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:23,280
Yeah, so theoretically if I'm lunging at him, I'm trying to maybe snap his neck.

158
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,080
Theoretically trying to snap his neck.

159
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,600
Which is a real bummer for Joe, but Clark is going to love it.

160
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Okay.

161
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,040
What do you think, D8?

162
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,240
Do you know what a normal unarmed combat roll damage is?

163
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,800
Probably like a D6 or a D4.

164
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,240
Then like a D8 or a D12 would be what I'm thinking.

165
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,480
Rules knowledge is why people listen to Pretending to be People.

166
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
I'm rolling a D8.

167
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,840
I just think it's funny that you're like, a punch, I don't know, probably.

168
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
The most baseline thing.

169
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,800
Standard unarmed, you could say.

170
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,280
I rolled a five.

171
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,560
Alright, Oz Mayhem Wolf.

172
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,720
He's wearing some padding, so he's not going to take all of that damage, but you come up

173
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,760
and do you want to describe what you try to do to him here?

174
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,720
Because you're not snapping his neck, but you are going to put him in a compromising

175
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
position.

176
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
Physically.

177
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,320
I'll get him in a headlock, and because Clark hasn't snapped many necks in his life, he's

178
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,280
trying to turn in a certain way, and maybe I'm just giving him real bad neck strain.

179
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,280
Real bad Charlie Wars.

180
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,240
Real bad Charlie Wars.

181
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,920
There's a skin burn all around his neck there, and with that, it's Planet Juggernaut's turn.

182
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
Thomas?

183
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,520
First, I want to look around at the crowd.

184
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,560
Is Marvin Glass, or is the Emperor in his box anywhere?

185
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,560
Interesting.

186
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,160
You actually see a box that looks like it would be the suite where Marvin Glass would

187
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,640
be, and it is currently curtained off.

188
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
Okay.

189
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:59,080
A tiny helicopter blade pops out of the top of Planet Juggernaut's head, and it rises

190
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:05,960
about three feet off the ground, and it's kind of like...

191
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,720
Let's see if we can actually get that going.

192
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,280
Justin, go ahead and roll a D100.

193
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,280
That's just him turning on.

194
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,060
That's not what I want to do.

195
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,580
It'll still play.

196
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,440
He rolled a 36, Thomas, so you're going to need to roll under a 36.

197
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,840
Yeah, no, this is a great mechanic.

198
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
64.

199
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:32,520
When I'm 36 and your blade, helicopter chopper blade comes up, and it starts going, but it's

200
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,280
going very conkily and slowly.

201
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,440
Wait, I thought I had to roll over 36.

202
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,440
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,960
I would have rolled differently.

204
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,560
I had the wrong intent in these dice.

205
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,720
But that's not the completion of your turn, so go ahead and...

206
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,360
I'm just saying, I could have Reiki'd these dudes into...

207
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,360
All right.

208
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,520
Do you have warm hands right now?

209
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,520
I do.

210
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,600
Then roll heat, baby.

211
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,040
Before Justin rolls, tell me what you're trying to finish with this turn here.

212
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,120
You're not going to lift off the ground.

213
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,120
I just wanted to activate.

214
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
Gotcha.

215
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,760
Then you failed miserably, and it is Keith's turn.

216
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
Okay.

217
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,400
No, no, no.

218
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
Tell me...

219
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,120
He said it popped out, and it's just flying janky, so you can mess with that idea.

220
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,120
All right.

221
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,720
I want to shoot him with my laser eyes.

222
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,120
Oh, fuck.

223
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,840
Who are you aiming at?

224
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,280
I'm aiming at you, Luke.

225
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
Okay.

226
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,280
I figured.

227
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,280
Right at Keith, Vigna.

228
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,640
Go ahead and roll Justin first.

229
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,280
Let's see if this'll...

230
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,280
19.

231
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,800
Can he roll under a 19, Thomas?

232
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
Five.

233
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
Hell yeah, dude.

234
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
Baby.

235
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
All right.

236
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,400
So you've got laser eyes.

237
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,840
What's that look like on your big, metal, shiny, boar body?

238
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,840
Well, it looks like that villain from Sonic.

239
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,840
What is that dude's name?

240
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,840
Dr. Eggman.

241
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,840
Dr. Eggman.

242
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
So imagine like that.

243
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,840
Dr. Robotnik, if you're nasty.

244
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
Oh, Robotnik.

245
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
Yeah.

246
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:10,440
Just imagine those eyes just like glowing and then shooting lasers out of them at Keith,

247
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,440
Vigna.

248
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
Absolutely.

249
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,080
40% that we talked about.

250
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
40%.

251
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,080
40%.

252
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,840
Keith, are you going to try to react with a offensive action or are you going to try

253
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,480
to dodge in some way?

254
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,920
Yeah, I'm going to try to jump out of the way.

255
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:31,920
I have, in addition to the same bomb squad gear that Clark has on, I have these...

256
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,080
I wrote down gump leg braces, but they're super jump slash super run braces on my legs.

257
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,080
All right.

258
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,920
So I'm going to try to just jump out of the way.

259
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,960
So what is your dodge skill?

260
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,960
Base is 30.

261
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:53,600
So we'll give you a plus 40 for your cool jumping stuff.

262
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
I got a three.

263
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
You rolled a three, Thomas.

264
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
You're going to roll against...

265
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,760
I just have to roll over that?

266
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,240
Over it and under 40.

267
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
Yeah.

268
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,240
84.

269
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,240
Oof.

270
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,240
So...

271
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,240
So I jump out of the way.

272
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,640
As lasers shoot out of the eyes of Planet Jugger and I...

273
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,480
What kind of surface is on the, like, what's on the ground here?

274
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,040
I think like a sterile, shiny metal surface.

275
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,040
Okay.

276
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,600
So it, like, scorches.

277
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Yeah.

278
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Yeah.

279
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
And it makes, like, cool little metalworking.

280
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Star Wars sparks.

281
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
It's got little...

282
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,000
It's got the Planet Juggernaut logo.

283
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Like...

284
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Ooh.

285
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yeah.

286
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That's why...

287
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,200
That's why it never hits, because it's really more for effect.

288
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
It's much cool.

289
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,200
Can you describe...

290
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Much cool.

291
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
Much cool.

292
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,300
Can you describe, I guess, Planet Juggernaut himself, but especially when you say it shoots

293
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,300
out of its eyes.

294
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,020
Where did we see those lasers come from?

295
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,020
The head part, you would be like, oh, that's...

296
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,020
That's the head.

297
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,020
Like, toward the top?

298
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,020
Towards the top.

299
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,020
Yeah.

300
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,020
If it's a big circle, it's where the eyes might be.

301
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,020
Yeah.

302
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,020
Which from...

303
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,020
If it's a big circle, it could be in the middle.

304
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,020
Not like a smiley face.

305
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,020
More like a Pac-Man.

306
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,020
Got it.

307
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,020
But with now a giant mouth.

308
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,020
Just tiny laser eyes.

309
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,020
Nice.

310
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,020
Yeah.

311
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,020
Oh, actually, I want a giant Pac-Man mouth.

312
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,980
That can open up later, baby.

313
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:09,220
Keith Vigna, it is your turn after dodging out of the way with your cool jumping boots.

314
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,700
I am flying through the air.

315
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,780
So mid-air, I want to pull out...

316
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:19,740
I've got a saw launcher that has diamond-bladed saws that shoot out of it, and I want to aim

317
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:28,000
that over at Planet Juggernaut, and I want to just mid-mass shoot a saw at him.

318
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Like a buzzsaw?

319
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Like a circular saw?

320
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Like a circular saw, yeah.

321
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Okay, gotcha.

322
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,940
So go ahead and roll firearms for me.

323
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,940
Planet Juggernaut.

324
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,460
That's a 42 on a 70.

325
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,420
You can try to make a dodge maneuver here, but you'll have to critically succeed in order

326
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,900
to dodge.

327
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,180
Okay.

328
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,420
No.

329
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:51,400
Keith, describe what this looks like as you're flying through the air.

330
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,300
You pull out a saw shooting through.

331
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:58,100
I see the lasers start to form in his eyes, and I can see that they're aimed mostly at

332
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,100
me.

333
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:04,460
So I jump out of the way, and I'm about 10 feet up in the air, going over to the side

334
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:13,060
away from Oz and Clark, and I pull out, kind of looks like a giant crossbow, and it has

335
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:18,500
a giant circular saw on it, and you can tell that the edges are shiny.

336
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:27,220
And I aim it, shoot it, and it flies circular, just shooting right at Planet Juggernaut,

337
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,220
and it whacks.

338
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,220
All right.

339
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,780
Call that 1d8 plus 3.

340
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,260
Put that down.

341
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,820
That's 8 plus 3.

342
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,380
Oh, smacks.

343
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:45,340
So this blade fully embeds itself into one of the eyes, or where the laser came out of

344
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,340
Planet Juggernaut.

345
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,660
He said midsection.

346
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:53,700
The midsection of a face is where the eyes are.

347
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,620
The nose is the face's belly button.

348
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,620
Take away my laser eyes.

349
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,620
No, no, no.

350
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,620
It doesn't take him away.

351
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:05,180
It is going to take down the damage a little bit, and it embeds itself fully in there as

352
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,860
you take 11 damage.

353
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,860
Nice.

354
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:15,020
It is Oz Mayhem Wolf's turn, and he is confused.

355
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:23,380
He is going to run, and as he runs, he's going to try to jump at Planet Juggernaut.

356
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,500
So he is going to roll.

357
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:35,100
If you want to dodge, you can oppose this roll with a dodge roll, Thomas.

358
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,340
I crit failed.

359
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:45,860
So basically, he has these boots on that, as he's running toward you, as he's about

360
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:53,420
to take off, he clicks a button and a little thing in his hand, much like one would click

361
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,140
the ignition of a bomb or something like that.

362
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:01,060
And as soon as he does so, he gets prepared and ready to jump.

363
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,500
He barely makes it out one inch off the ground.

364
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:10,820
He comes out of his shoes, and his boots are stuck to the ground underneath him, and he

365
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:17,500
falls on his face in front of him, halfway in between the group and Planet Juggernaut.

366
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,260
And the crowd goes wild.

367
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,740
And the crowd goes wild after that crazy first round, Mick.

368
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,220
What did we see out there?

369
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,820
We saw Planet Juggernaut really struggling.

370
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,020
Yeah, you know, Mick.

371
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,020
Wait.

372
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,860
I'm Mick, you're Mick, we're all Mick for Nichols.

373
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:44,820
You know, Planet Juggernaut had a 97% murder rate in the first 45 seconds before this match.

374
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,820
Has he lost it, folks?

375
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,820
I don't know.

376
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,420
Well, we're only six seconds in, so we will find out shortly, but we have an interesting

377
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:57,900
thing happen with seemingly one of Oz Mayhem Wolf's friends turning on him in the very

378
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,260
first moments of the fight.

379
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:03,900
Let's see if that interbreeding continues throughout this contest.

380
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,300
Who knows?

381
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,700
You know what's crazy is we thought Planet Juggernaut lacked humanity, but I'm just not

382
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:17,820
seeing it from these three out here today.

383
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,180
And with that, let's go ahead and look at the board as we take a quick second to go

384
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,060
to our kiss cam here in the scrap pit.

385
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:32,220
Looking up, you see on the jumbotron, they're showing just these two dudes in the audience

386
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,500
who are both cheering and one looks a lot like Luke and the other one looks a lot like

387
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Joe.

388
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,740
And the camera zooms in on you guys.

389
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,740
They look at each other tentatively.

390
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,940
Oh, that's a long one.

391
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,340
Looks like there's a lot of passion in that bedroom.

392
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,340
All right.

393
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:55,940
Let's get back to the action and see what happens in round two.

394
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:02,140
Clark Bishop, you begin the action in round two.

395
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,380
So I'm feeling better now after I got that aggression out of me and I want to yell to

396
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,380
Oz.

397
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,380
I'm sorry.

398
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,380
I didn't know we were on the same side.

399
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,380
I get it now.

400
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,380
I got it.

401
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,380
We're good.

402
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,380
We're good.

403
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,980
It was like extremely rude of you to come at me like that.

404
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,860
I didn't appreciate it one bit.

405
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,860
It's my fault.

406
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,860
Didn't understand.

407
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,860
I got it now.

408
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,860
All right.

409
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,420
And I pull out my rocket launcher that I have strapped to my back and I'm not aiming at

410
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,420
the body.

411
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,780
I'm aiming at one of the arms.

412
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,340
Ooh, interesting.

413
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:33,420
So that'll be a called shot and I need you to roll a firearms check for me.

414
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,020
What does the cold shot do to me?

415
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,200
Negative 40.

416
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,620
That's negative 40 for a head shot, but it says negative 20.

417
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,700
I don't have a head, so I think it should be negative 40.

418
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,700
That makes sense.

419
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,000
Up to you as far as, is that equivalent?

420
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,880
Let's call it negative 40.

421
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,880
Cool.

422
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:53,520
Thomas, what do you, what is planet juggernaut doing to oppose this before we hear that role?

423
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,280
Planet juggernaut puts like one of his arms up in front of his like laser eyes and like

424
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,680
tries to swat at the missile no matter what like happens.

425
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,680
Love it.

426
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,680
We'll see.

427
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,640
All right, let's hear that role.

428
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,120
It's a fail because of the minus 40.

429
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
It's a 74.

430
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,280
So he, he just like nimbly just like flicks it and it goes like tumbling into part of

431
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,280
the crowd.

432
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:21,640
It goes tumbling up into part of the dome that's up there and when it hits the dome,

433
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:27,480
it actually, the entire like floor that you're on and the dome itself rattles and it like

434
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,600
sends reverberations all the way through and you hear just this massive roar from the crowd

435
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,240
as they get fucking amped.

436
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,240
It's like seeing a wreck, but nobody got hurt yet because it's going to happen later.

437
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,840
Probably the hurt, the hurt will happen later.

438
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,840
I would imagine.

439
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,440
And with that it is a planet juggernaut's turn.

440
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,440
Okay.

441
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,600
He, he putters out with his little helicopter directly over Oz mayhem wolf and then turns

442
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,600
off the helicopter.

443
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:01,620
All right, so I, you don't have to do anything in order to succeed at that and I will simply

444
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,580
roll a dodge out here in front of you.

445
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:13,140
He's going to turn on a defensive mask on his helmet that basically clogs your sensors

446
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,500
that show you where people are on the field of battle.

447
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:24,540
And so if he can roll under a 40% actually because you did it, I'll give him a 20% so

448
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:30,580
he's only got a 20% chance to dodge and he fails with a 60.

449
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:37,760
A red goo just comes out from, so that will, that will happen.

450
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,260
We will not see the effects of that yet.

451
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:45,560
Um, because Oz mayhem wolf is out of sight, but not out of my mind.

452
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,860
I feel something.

453
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:52,500
It's like a leg or something caught in some of my gears feels weird.

454
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:59,920
For my second attack action, I want to punch Joe going to punch the old Clark Bishop who

455
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,900
just shot a rocket launcher in your direction.

456
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,900
Clark you've already attacked, so you can roll a dodge if you would like to oppose.

457
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,460
I would like to.

458
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:14,700
If you have any sort of a thing on you that can help you mechanically, holler that out

459
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,700
now.

460
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,160
Well, I did write down that I've got the same kind of pneumatic legs as Keith and give yourself

461
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,280
a plus 40 on that Dodge, which takes your Dodge up to 90.

462
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,280
Holy shit.

463
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:29,160
Thomas playing at juggernaut is rolling a 60%.

464
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,160
I believe.

465
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,160
Is that right?

466
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,160
Uh, yeah.

467
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,160
All right.

468
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,820
So is this, what is this contested on?

469
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:39,540
The punching is just your standard fighting skill for punching.

470
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,940
Right.

471
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,580
So I passed that, but how am I ever going to pass a 90%?

472
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,580
It's a contest.

473
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:49,060
So you just did cause I rolled a nine.

474
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,660
I passed, but I was lower than him.

475
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,660
Oh, I see how that works.

476
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,660
Okay.

477
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,660
How will he ever beat that?

478
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,860
I get it.

479
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:00,600
So describe your action as a Clark Bishop tries to jump out of the way.

480
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,440
So this all kind of happens in one move.

481
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:09,900
Like he's puttering over towards Oz and he like flicks the rocket as he's coming down

482
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,040
onto him.

483
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,880
And then he kind of like Springs up back towards Clark.

484
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,740
You see the little helicopter blade where again, he's just had his hand up from where

485
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:22,440
he flipped the thing and he just brings it straight down at Clark.

486
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
Oh, okay.

487
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,440
Roll 66 for damage.

488
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,860
Oh no, wait, does my body armor help me?

489
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,860
Yeah.

490
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,860
Okay.

491
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,780
You'll get five DR damage resistance.

492
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,780
Still fucked.

493
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:48,660
16 to Malort for math, quick math, 10, 16, 18, 21, 23.

494
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:53,420
What is your, so 23 minus five, 18, 18.

495
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,960
And what is, what was your health at before?

496
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,960
Uh, 26.

497
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,960
So I'm now at eight.

498
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,120
Do you want to spend luck to reduce some of that damage?

499
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,120
Yeah.

500
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,120
You've gotten a lot of luck.

501
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,120
Don't you?

502
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
Yeah.

503
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,720
It's 10 whole points to reduce it by one D six, which isn't that big a deal if you're

504
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,840
rolling 12 of them at a time.

505
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,840
Six of them.

506
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,820
Six, six D six, not 12, but that's literally one sixth.

507
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,080
I'll use 10 luck to mitigate it by a D six.

508
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,080
All right.

509
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,080
Roll that D six.

510
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,380
I got three back.

511
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,380
All right.

512
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:28,340
So I'm at 11 and I'm at 50 luck.

513
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,340
Jesus.

514
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:36,900
Motherfucker sitting at like 60 luck and it's like, I'm going to spend 10 Keith Vigna.

515
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,300
It is your turn.

516
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,300
Okay.

517
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:45,740
I'm going to jump up kind of closer to planet juggernaut and I want to use my suction gloves

518
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:51,140
that I have on to suction on to the wall, maybe like 10 feet above him.

519
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:57,360
And then I want to pull out my nitro thrower and aim it at him and try to freeze his propeller.

520
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,800
Fucking dope.

521
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
Very good.

522
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Okay.

523
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:10,040
Uh, so you can roll a firearms check in order to try to attain that goal.

524
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,240
Thomas, do you want to combat it in a Dodge movement?

525
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
Yes.

526
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,240
Fair.

527
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
I got a 65 on a 70.

528
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,340
Oh shit.

529
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,340
All right.

530
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:27,700
So describe what happens is you basically, so I go from where I landed after shooting

531
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:34,740
that saw, I jump up over about 10 feet above juggernaut and about five or 10 feet away

532
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,420
from him as well.

533
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:42,900
I use one hand with a suction glove to suction on to the dome.

534
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:50,220
I pull out the nitro thrower and I just let it unload all over the top of planet juggernaut.

535
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,200
Yeah.

536
00:28:52,200 --> 00:29:04,880
And as you shower planet juggernaut with your nitro, you render his ability to hover

537
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,880
useless.

538
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,880
Yeah.

539
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
Nice.

540
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:15,120
You see another little propeller pop up, but it takes a second to whir around.

541
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:22,180
You guys look over, uh, you saw planet juggernaut bounce essentially off of Oz mayhem Wolf and

542
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:30,360
looking in the dent planet juggernaut left in the floor, you see crawling out from the

543
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:40,860
dent is Oz mayhem Wolf and he looks fucking rough and he crawls and he sits cross-legged

544
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,340
and tries to put his boots back on.

545
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,960
And that's the end of round two.

546
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,080
Nick Nichols, we have seen some stuff today.

547
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,760
First we have Clark Bishop shooting a rocket launcher that gets flicked right out of the

548
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,760
way.

549
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,760
What'd you think about that one, Nick?

550
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,520
You know, that scrappy fellow really is impressing me today with his inability to do much of

551
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,880
anything useful at all for his team.

552
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,560
Planet juggernaut smashed that scrappy fellow like a plastic bag filled with warm ground

553
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,560
up pork.

554
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,240
I don't know about you, but I am positively starving.

555
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,680
I am absolutely hungry now.

556
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,020
Thank you for that delicious analogy.

557
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:20,860
And then planet juggernaut just sits right on top of Oz mayhem Wolf before bouncing off

558
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,380
to slap Clark Bishop right on top of the head.

559
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:29,860
I have never seen a man completely disappear under planet juggernaut like that before and

560
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,860
emerge alive.

561
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,900
It truly was a sight to see.

562
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:40,240
Oz mayhem Wolf is a regular here in the scrap pan and has been ever since his brother got

563
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,980
fucked over by Marvin Glass.

564
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:48,820
And then with that one, we saw Keith Vigna, former police officer from contention and

565
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:53,700
a cadet from the city do some very cool movements.

566
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,580
What did you think about the stuff that he did?

567
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,700
I've heard nothing but horrible things about Keith Vigna.

568
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,780
Quite frankly, I am super impressed with his performance today.

569
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:09,420
It has been one dope thing after another from that weird looking dude.

570
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:15,200
Down in the field, we have our correspondent.

571
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,840
What's our correspondent's name tonight, Nick Nichols?

572
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,840
Who's down there?

573
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,840
Who do we got?

574
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,200
What kind of correspondent is he?

575
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,960
Oh, he's doing the trivia contest today.

576
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,440
Jeremiah Jones, I think.

577
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,360
Jeremiah Jones is down there and he's got three contestants from the audience and he

578
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,720
is ready to interview them now and ask some questions.

579
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,000
Let's take it down to Jeremiah.

580
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:46,540
Hi, hey everybody, it's Jeremiah Jones and I'm here with three people who are here to

581
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:52,260
watch the Scrap Pit fight and we're going to try to win some prizes today.

582
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,340
If you want to introduce yourselves, what is your name, sir?

583
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,340
Woo!

584
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,860
I'm David from Akron.

585
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:04,300
We drove 350 miles to be here tonight in the Scrap Pit.

586
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,720
I'm rooting for Planet Juggernaut.

587
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,720
Woo!

588
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,680
Okay, David, thanks for being here and who's next to you here?

589
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,960
I'm little Davey.

590
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,520
I'm David's son.

591
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,280
Speak up, little Davey.

592
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,880
He made me drive the whole way here because he was drinking.

593
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,880
Woo!

594
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,880
Woo!

595
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,560
And you, sir, there on the end.

596
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,720
Hello there.

597
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,200
I'm a fan of Oz.

598
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,000
I came to see everybody he's in.

599
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,520
I love him so.

600
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,860
Okay, so we've got some pretty cool prizes for you guys.

601
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:41,180
If you could answer these questions, then you might win a t-shirt.

602
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,140
It's got Planet Juggernaut on it.

603
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,580
Would you like that tonight, guys?

604
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,580
Woo!

605
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,300
Yeah, I'll give it to my dad if I win.

606
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:55,500
If I win, I'll give it to his dad as well.

607
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,940
I don't see any way I can lose tonight.

608
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,940
Okay, David.

609
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,460
Everything's coming up, Dave.

610
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,600
Dave, it seems like you've got a really good chance of winning a t-shirt here.

611
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:19,120
First question, on which day of the week are Americans most likely to get blackout drunk?

612
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,080
Any day that ends in Y, brother.

613
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,920
But seriously, Friday?

614
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,460
Yeah, yep.

615
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,460
It's Friday.

616
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,560
It is Friday and you win a t-shirt with Planet Juggernaut on it.

617
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,620
David, close your ears.

618
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,540
I honestly don't remember more Fridays than I do, if you know what I mean.

619
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,540
I personally don't know what you mean.

620
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,540
I remember everything.

621
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:46,140
I slap him really hard on the back.

622
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,700
Woo!

623
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,620
I remember my childbirth.

624
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,100
David Jr., it's your turn.

625
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,060
We've got a trivia question.

626
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,060
It's little Davey.

627
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,420
Oh, little Davey.

628
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,560
I've got a question for you here.

629
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,200
What color is a bird?

630
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,760
Um, uh, blue.

631
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,760
That's right.

632
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,760
That's right.

633
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,760
You get a t-shirt.

634
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,760
There are blue birds.

635
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,760
Hey, yeah.

636
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,140
Way to go, little dude.

637
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:22,000
Little Davey gives it to his dad and then kind of cowers away.

638
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Dave wipes a tear from his eye.

639
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,720
A single tear.

640
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,320
I love you, dad.

641
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,740
I love you, little Davey.

642
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,740
That's right, Ning Nickels.

643
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:35,100
We had to make some of the questions a bit easier because people were not sober enough

644
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,500
to answer proper trivia questions.

645
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,020
Let's go back down to that third question.

646
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,180
What do you think about all that, Nick?

647
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,780
I just want to hear Jeremiah Johnson say more things.

648
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:51,140
Jeremiah Johnson here, and I'm reporting to ask this question of this man who is here

649
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,740
to support his friend from the Motherland.

650
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,740
May Oz Wolf.

651
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,740
Hey, Mayhem.

652
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,160
Oh, I'm so sorry.

653
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,160
What's your name?

654
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,160
It's, uh, Farsi.

655
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,560
Yeah, Farsi, thanks for coming down.

656
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,760
I don't, I don't know Oz.

657
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,000
I just, I just identify with him.

658
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:18,640
So the fan of Oz, Mayhem, Wolf, and, um, the, the question that we have tonight is, are

659
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,480
you having a good time?

660
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:26,340
I, I, I was, and then, uh, the juggernaut, he landed on Oz, and I'm, uh, so worried.

661
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,340
That's right.

662
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,340
That's right.

663
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,340
You are worried.

664
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,480
I can tell from my senses of your body.

665
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,480
You won a t-shirt.

666
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,260
All right, thank you, Jeremiah Johnson.

667
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:43,100
Nick Nickels, what did we think about all this trivia we're having around here today?

668
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:48,520
You know, you love seeing a father and a son bond so much, and you love seeing a superfan.

669
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,700
You see them like on camera, like Dave and little Davey.

670
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,000
Little Davey is on his Dave's shoulders.

671
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,700
When I'm like, I'm like, give him a woo, little Davey, give him a woo.

672
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,700
Wow.

673
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,220
True parental greatness.

674
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,720
You see me like giving him my beer, like up on my shoulders.

675
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,940
It's really heartwarming to see a father who knows how to take care of a young boy in this

676
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,940
country.

677
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,940
All right.

678
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:20,400
The action here in round three of the Scrap It.

679
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,520
And starting off round three, we've got Clark Bishop.

680
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,660
Clark Bishop starts round three.

681
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,760
So I'm kind of under the hand of the thing now.

682
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:37,360
I want to try and wriggle out and use a magnetic trap that I brought with me.

683
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,960
I figure I'll set it under where I am right now, hopefully trapping his arm there.

684
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
Awesome.

685
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,180
I was hoping I could use a survival skill for that as far as setting traps go.

686
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,180
Sweet.

687
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:52,620
Thomas, does Planet of Juggernaut want to try to dodge out of the way here as this is

688
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,620
happening?

689
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:58,460
Well, I didn't imagine that after I punched you, I just left my hand there, but.

690
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:03,760
Close enough for horseshoes, hand grenades, and magnets.

691
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,020
Fucking God.

692
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,020
I would.

693
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,020
I crit fail.

694
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:15,600
You could also say, fuck me, in Clark's, uh, as Clark's character.

695
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,120
It's that goddamn death magic curse at me again.

696
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,120
Me damn it.

697
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:25,360
Clark Bishop, as you go to set this, what do you have on you?

698
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:31,720
Let's go ahead and say that as you set this trap and start to scuttle backwards, the trap

699
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,760
sets earlier than you thought it was going to and your rocket launcher flies out of your

700
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:42,140
hands and sticks to the ground ahead of you, out of your grasp.

701
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,500
That makes sense.

702
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,680
Planet Juggernaut, Europe.

703
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,380
Planet Juggernaut seems eerily still.

704
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,380
Oh no.

705
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,380
Oh no.

706
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,380
Hell yeah.

707
00:37:51,380 --> 00:38:02,380
You see, you see like a faint light coming out of like some seams in him and some vents

708
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,200
are opening up and like letting some steam out.

709
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,440
Uh, and you hear, you hear this like worrying.

710
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:22,200
It's just kind of charging up Keith Vigner, I'm going to unsuction from the dome and kick

711
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:30,040
off the dome to get, try to get to the far end, as far away as I can from a planet juggernaut.

712
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:39,700
And I want to set up a mounted 50 cal machine gun with armor piercing bullets and let go.

713
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:45,060
So first things first, I need you to roll a dexterity because when you put your feet

714
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:53,300
on the dome, your feet feel an adhesive and you are stuck to the dome.

715
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,080
Yeah, I failed my dexterity roll.

716
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,260
And you cannot release from this position.

717
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:02,040
You are now hanging by your feet on the side of the dome.

718
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,680
Can I still use an attack or is that?

719
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,440
You will be at a negative 40 percent.

720
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,440
Okay.

721
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,520
I'll launch another saw at him.

722
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,880
Go ahead and roll that firearms check for me.

723
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,560
Is it at a negative 40?

724
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,560
It is indeed.

725
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,560
So what's that make your firearms?

726
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,200
30, but I rolled a 13.

727
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,440
Oh, planet juggernaut is currently unable to dodge.

728
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,860
So you will roll a success there.

729
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,740
What did I have you write down there for damage?

730
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,740
G8 plus three.

731
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,460
Roll that D8 for me, Lukey boy.

732
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,140
That is a four total.

733
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,140
Four total?

734
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,140
Yeah, one plus three.

735
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,580
Well, that explains it.

736
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:46,180
You are hanging upside down, shooting backwards at your target like a sloth with a gun.

737
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:50,260
It kind of like arcs through the air and then kind of like skids off him flying.

738
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,220
The armor piercing round does not quite pierce the armor.

739
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,220
Well, no, this was the saw blade.

740
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,360
Whatever dude.

741
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,360
So it leaves a big catch.

742
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,360
Yeah, it chops off a little bit of him, but not much.

743
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,360
Shing!

744
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,360
Shoo!

745
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,360
Foo!

746
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:16,840
And with that, it is Oz Mayhem Wolf's turn and he is getting his shoes back on and as

747
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:24,160
he gets his boots back on, he stands up, clicks a button in his left hand and begins running

748
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:30,500
toward Planet Juggernaut once again, hopefully this time in a successful manner.

749
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:37,640
However, as he runs, a panel on the ground lifts up and flings him.

750
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,400
So let's see if he can avoid this.

751
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,860
He fails his roll.

752
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,780
So he gets flung out of the air.

753
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:52,780
He's just running and you see a panel on the floor just launch him and he flies into the

754
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,800
dome and gets stuck like a spider in a web.

755
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,960
No, spiders don't get stuck on webs.

756
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,400
Like a fly in a web.

757
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,400
Like not a spider on a web.

758
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,400
Like a man in his house.

759
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,280
Wait.

760
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:15,560
Stuck to one position where he can only look out into the audience and as he's looking

761
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:23,340
out into the audience, he sees moving past a crowd of allured, yelling, drunk assholes.

762
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:29,180
He sees a very short young woman and a very tall old man, both wearing black suits, white

763
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:35,660
shirts, black ties, black sunglasses, and ill-fitting windbreakers moving through this

764
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,580
crowd of nonsensical monsters.

765
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,420
You hear a faint, woo, somewhere in the crowd.

766
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:49,640
Many, many, many faint woos as the crowd is going nuts because shit is getting crazy.

767
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,720
And that is our third round here in the scrap pit.

768
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,720
Boy howdy.

769
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:02,760
Right around we have Clark Bishop, ex-contention police officer, current monster and god thinker

770
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,000
of himself.

771
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,100
He just cannot get anything off today.

772
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,320
His rocket launcher flew right off his back.

773
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,320
You know what I have to think?

774
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,760
What do you have to think, Nick?

775
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,500
I wonder, and you know I truly do wonder, is he cursed by death magic?

776
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:22,660
I think it's 100% possible that this Clark Bishop could indeed be cursed by death magic.

777
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:27,960
And Planet Juggernaut is doing something, ooh, boy howdy, he's got something up his

778
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,700
proverbial arms.

779
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,900
You know, I'm wondering if he's planning for the big one.

780
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:38,000
Oh, he just might be, and if we get to see him pull this off, boy howdy, would this fight

781
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,980
not last much longer.

782
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:45,560
I truly do hope that he hasn't lost his will to murder and he's just hanging out.

783
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,640
That would be a sight to see.

784
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:52,180
Any time we can get some humanity out of the robots in this world, I think we should go

785
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,120
for it and praise them.

786
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,360
And what do you think about that Keith Vigna fella?

787
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,800
Well, on this turn, he finally fucked up.

788
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:04,640
We heard that's what he's wanting to do, and he finally got his feet all stucky sticky

789
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,620
on the side of the dome.

790
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:11,640
You know, if he's trying to hit Planet Juggernaut, and Planet Juggernaut is indeed resting like

791
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:17,080
some of us think he might be, that would be a really classy move by a really classy guy.

792
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:22,480
Yeah, we got OsmayHipWolf who's trying to make an attack with boots finally on his feet.

793
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,440
He just gets flung right into the wall where he gets stuck like a spider on a web.

794
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:33,120
You know, that's crazy, he has been off his game all day today and he is surely disappointing

795
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,740
his greatest fan today.

796
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:38,060
Let's go ahead and take a quick moment of silence.

797
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:45,680
Everyone here in the scrap pit remembers our dear brothers, Rich and Richard, right?

798
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,360
Dick and Rich Nichols.

799
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,880
One of those two works.

800
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:55,640
And they were absolutely proponents of this ring and big security advisors for the making

801
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,440
of this massive dome room.

802
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:04,820
And we lost them earlier this week, so we would like to take a quick 30 second moment

803
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,140
of silence in their honor.

804
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,440
Whoo!

805
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,440
Both in silence!

806
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,440
Shut the fuck up!

807
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,440
Oh my god!

808
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,440
No, no!

809
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,440
That was 30 seconds!

810
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,440
Happy you lost all your humanity's time!

811
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:51,940
That was 30 seconds for your creepy ass brothers, whoo!

812
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:55,120
That man must have known our brothers, they were creepy assholes.

813
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,120
Let's get back to the action here in Route 4.

814
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,120
What do you say, Dick?

815
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:12,500
Yeah, the crowd is really wanting to see some blood here today and I, you know, I also do.

816
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,180
Back to the top of Route 4.

817
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,740
Clark Bishop, it's your turn.

818
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:20,380
That trap that shot up and flung Oz, can I see, is it still up?

819
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:23,580
No, the ground immediately went back to where it was.

820
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:29,000
I want to run over to it and knowing that it's there, try to use its angle and momentum

821
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,240
to launch me onto Planet Juggernaut.

822
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,240
Roll an athletics check.

823
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:39,540
Can I do decks?

824
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,040
Roll a dexterity check there, whoo!

825
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,400
Oh my god, Dex Shepard would be a pretty good name for a roleplaying deck.

826
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:50,360
I pass a 17 and that would pass both athletics and decks.

827
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,360
Alright.

828
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:56,900
Planet Juggernaut is still warming himself, so you will be able to do this real quick.

829
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:03,420
Just want to say, Dex Shepard, be like a, like a, like a thief.

830
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,620
Yeah, like a rogue.

831
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,380
Yeah, like a rogue who's like a wheelman.

832
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,380
What's a wheelman?

833
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,780
Like the guy who drives cars.

834
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,180
A wheelman!

835
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:17,100
You know, like, some dudes are into legs and some are into butts.

836
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,100
He's a real wheelman.

837
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,100
He's a wheelman.

838
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,100
He's a wheelman.

839
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,220
You know that guy, he's a real wheelman.

840
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,220
He's the opposite of Pinocchio.

841
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,520
I'm saying he fucks cars.

842
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,520
He's a wheelman.

843
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,520
Look at the muffler on that one.

844
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,800
Oh my goodness gracious.

845
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,960
So Joe, describe Clark's jump.

846
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,960
He's rushing over to that trap and he's got those pneumatic legs on and the pneumatic

847
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,720
gloves on and he knows where he's going to land so he kind of jumps onto that trap and

848
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:49,920
it springs up and he flings himself straight at Planet Juggernaut hoping to land kind of

849
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,920
on the top of him.

850
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:56,100
And when he does, he's using those pneumatic gloves to kind of like punch inward and try

851
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:59,100
and stabilize himself on the top of it.

852
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,100
Oh, cool.

853
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,180
Roll strength here.

854
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:09,420
That's a pass, a 35 on a 65.

855
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:14,580
Okay, so describe this exactly how you want it to look.

856
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,780
You know when a bodybuilder is like flexing their muscles, he's coming all the way up

857
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:23,180
to the top and then half moons around the side and bam, right into the top dome area

858
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,180
there.

859
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,120
And I don't know what's inside it so explain to me what my hands pierce maybe.

860
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:33,340
So it would be like a thin metal material that would completely wrap around your fists

861
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:36,000
as you moved them in there.

862
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,560
With the purpose of being stabilized on top of it, so I'm holding it kind of like maybe

863
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,540
you would hold the horn on the saddle maybe?

864
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:47,640
Stable you are like a horse rider of a horse, Planet Juggernaut.

865
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,440
You have taken your time and you are ready to go.

866
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:56,880
Clark Bishop isn't on top of Planet Juggernaut for very long because he starts to feel Planet

867
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:03,720
Juggernaut moving underneath him and he sees the secondary helicopter blade pop out and

868
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,440
Planet Juggernaut rises off the ground and then it's weird.

869
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,280
It's like the outside surface is spinning around something on the inside, but all of

870
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:19,840
a sudden you're latched on and you're going down a roller coaster and it's spinning slow

871
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:25,560
but then it starts going very fast and then Planet Juggernaut drops to the ground and

872
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,280
takes off.

873
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,960
You are going to roll, what did we say for this one?

874
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,440
3d6 for every one I hit.

875
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,280
Did I give you a percentage?

876
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,280
The 60 I think.

877
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,080
I don't know, actually we didn't do a percentage, I figured maybe people would just try to dodge.

878
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,680
I think it's just a dodge, so everybody is going to roll dodge.

879
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:47,760
If you fail your dodge then you take 3d6 of damage.

880
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,760
Do I have a dodge?

881
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,440
You do indeed and we'll start with you.

882
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,280
Or would you try to just disengage?

883
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:55,600
I mean I think if I succeed this dodge that would do it.

884
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,600
Exactly.

885
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:02,960
Looks like a failure.

886
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,800
It's a crit fail.

887
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:10,920
He can't get his hands out.

888
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,000
That's not going to be good.

889
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,920
This is karma for all the amazing rolls I've had this whole time.

890
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,240
This whole campaign.

891
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,920
Joe is going to take 8 points of damage.

892
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,120
Shit, what's that put you at now?

893
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,720
That puts me at 3 hit points.

894
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,560
Alright do you want to use a 10 more luck here or are you going to?

895
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,440
Yeah I'll use 10 more for one d6.

896
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,560
Alright roll that d6.

897
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,560
4.

898
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,560
Nice.

899
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,560
Alright.

900
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,320
So I'm at 7 hit points.

901
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,120
Keith Vigna roll that dodge for me baby.

902
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,400
So do I just do what my normal dodge is?

903
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,960
I don't get any bonus from those legs since I'm stuck probably.

904
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,200
You are actually stuck up.

905
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,720
So you are out.

906
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,760
You're so stuck up.

907
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,760
I will actually.

908
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,760
I'm going to give you.

909
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,640
Finally someone says it.

910
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:58,800
I'm going to give you a plus 40% for being so far out of the way.

911
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,800
Yeah.

912
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,200
It's 5.

913
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,520
Alright so on that success basically Planet Juggernaut like as he's rolling toward you

914
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:12,800
realizes that he can't hit you with how high you are and so bails and goes after Oz Mayhem

915
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,080
Wolf who rolls an 83 failing.

916
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,880
So roll 3d6 for me Thomas.

917
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,600
12.

918
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,920
Ouch.

919
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,320
Oh wow okay.

920
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:32,960
The ball starts rolling and Clark Bishop can't get his hands out from underneath it and it

921
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:40,520
rolls over him and with the critical fail it continues to roll toward Oz Mayhem Wolf

922
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:46,100
and as it rolls over Oz it splatters him.

923
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:53,920
You actually see just viscera of guts and insides and this black ichor all just kind

924
00:50:53,920 --> 00:51:01,680
of like splurt out on either side and there is now a Nickelodeon style splat of dark red

925
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:07,680
on Planet Juggernaut but because of the crit fail as he's continuing to roll Clark Bishop

926
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,640
gets rolled over a second time.

927
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,880
So I need you to roll 3d6 again.

928
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:14,880
6.

929
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,120
6 points of damage and you were at what?

930
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:21,120
7 so I can survive that with one hit point.

931
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,840
Spend 10 more luck.

932
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,600
I would do that.

933
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,560
Yeah what are you saving the luck for?

934
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,800
The mechanics.

935
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,640
Yeah I mean like.

936
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:34,960
So you can either spend 10 luck to get a d6 more or you can roll a constitution check

937
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,380
to see if you stay conscious or unconscious.

938
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:41,600
If you fail the constitution check to stay conscious then you'll have to spend luck to

939
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,240
stay conscious.

940
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,240
Did that all make sense?

941
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:49,440
It did yeah I am yeah I'm gonna use the d6.

942
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,800
10 more luck spent puts you at what?

943
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,800
30.

944
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,600
He's unable to save himself.

945
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,880
3 so I have 4 hit points total.

946
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,480
Okay then you don't need to roll a constitution check here.

947
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,480
Oh.

948
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:14,480
Right before Osmayhimwolf dies you hear him go no my brother Elby my cousin V.

949
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:20,400
It was a plot point it's a me Osmayhimwolf.

950
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,280
All that's cut out.

951
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:29,000
You just hear from the crowd oh.

952
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,160
You also hear a very emphatic woo.

953
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,560
Keith Vigna it's your turn.

954
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:39,480
Okay I'm gonna try to so where is Juggernaut right now?

955
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,480
Rolling around baby.

956
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,800
Doing a couple victory laps.

957
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:49,500
Okay I'm going to reposition my feet on this dome to where I'm aimed in towards the inside

958
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,740
of the dome so what do I roll to do that dexterity?

959
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,120
I wasn't paying attention I'm sorry.

960
00:52:54,120 --> 00:53:00,600
I want to get to where I'm like standing on the dome but I want to like jump up farther

961
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:05,440
to where I'm like kind of overlooking the dome from above yeah yeah what do I need to

962
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:13,020
roll for that dexterity for me that is a fail all right you are still stuck feet stuck on

963
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,020
this dome.

964
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:20,780
Okay I want to shoot another saw at him.

965
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:27,340
You know it works go ahead and roll firearms.

966
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:30,740
That's a crit success 22 on a 70.

967
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:31,740
Nice.

968
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:36,300
Okay you're like technically already dodging because you're rolling around so go ahead

969
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,620
and roll if you can critically succeed what was your crit success?

970
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:40,620
22.

971
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:44,940
And it's impossible for you to win but go ahead and roll anyway.

972
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:48,300
No okay I think you should roll.

973
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:52,020
I know I did roll.

974
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:57,960
Your no was a sign of failure not a refusal to roll I hear you loud and clear.

975
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,120
That is an 8 plus 3 that's 11.

976
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:06,840
Okay with a critical success yeah dude you're gonna roll that 8 again 11 plus 11 plus 3

977
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:07,840
so 14.

978
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:14,500
Right 14 total and describe what this buzz saw does to the as I shoot it it's kind of

979
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:20,200
where I'm positioned juggernaut is rolling coming at me so the force of the launcher

980
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:26,160
and the force of him coming at me meet and the saw goes inside of juggernaut.

981
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:33,760
Woo love it and that is with the death of osmahan wolf that is the end of round four.

982
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:39,160
Okay boy howdy with the end of round four we've seen a lot of interesting developments

983
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:44,780
here we have clark bishop he goes ahead and just jumps and makes a big ol punch with hulk

984
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:49,320
fists right down into planet juggernaut what do we think about that?

985
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:58,120
What do we think about that?

986
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:03,320
You know it seems to me he got his hand stuck in the worst cookie jar of all time.

987
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:07,760
Planet juggernaut's horrible metal body.

988
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:14,640
Who put their hands inside planet juggernaut clark puts his hands inside oh right no one

989
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:19,940
left so I'm moving on planet juggernaut guys it was good I was just imagining if like a

990
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:25,480
sportscaster actually did that fucking terrible it would be.

991
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:30,760
Planet juggernaut you know he took his time last round to really save up something special

992
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,040
for us this time.

993
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:36,860
Yeah he uh coiled up like a big murderous roly poly and delivered quite a blistering

994
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:44,440
attack rolling over clark bishop twice and completely obliterating osmahan wolf into

995
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:50,320
a pit of pit you don't like the inside of a nectarine that's basically what it looked

996
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:56,780
like out there with osmahan wolf he is round and wrinkly on the inside his organs are disgusting.

997
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:00,680
You know the crowd sure is getting aroused by the blood and I can't say that I'm not

998
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:05,480
feeling a little something too how about you mick I can smell the iron and wine in

999
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:15,160
the air baby and much like a shepherd dog keith vigno is a one trick pony once again

1000
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:22,840
using the saw blade shooter at his vast disposal while stuck on the side of the dome shepherd

1001
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:29,960
dogs can famously learn many tricks you know I have to wonder why is he not moving is he

1002
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:36,300
too stupid or is he secretly a genius he seems to be landing the most hits at all these

1003
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:42,280
chunks and avoiding the damage at the same time you know I have a fun fact about planet

1004
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:48,640

1005
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,760
about planet juggernaut is that he keeps all the leftover teeth from all the matches and

1006
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:58,880
sleeps on a big pile of them that's what I hear it's important to have a legend behind

1007
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,560
any great villain at that moment you do see like a little hoover like coming out of the

1008

body of planet juggernaut and like sucking out the teeth that are stuck to him from oz
