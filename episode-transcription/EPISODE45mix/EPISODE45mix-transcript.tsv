0	7600	Hello to all my friends, my enemies, people in extra dimensional beards who feel neutral
7600	14800	about my existence, yall know everyone feels nothing but intense love for wolf the dog
14800	24120	which is my name, PTBP which is my radio station, and 694.2 which is my favorite grouping of
24120	29880	numbers to broadcast on, I'm here to love you as you have loved me and bring you some
29880	32880	tasty, tasty information.
32880	38680	But first, this week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Mia who tagged that pretending
38680	43820	pod on one of them there tweets, thanks for sharing the show with your friends Mia, she
43820	44820	writes
44820	51400	Greetings, the ladies sewing and seance circle would like to remind everyone that our annual
51400	56920	bake sale and dumpster dive are still on for next Friday, the time and location will
56920	62120	be on your bathroom Mia when you get out of the shower tomorrow, thanks for passing that
62120	65320	on Mr. the dog, thanks Mia.
65320	72340	It's good to know the LSSC is still running real strong and generally somehow managing
72340	78040	to both creep everyone out and bore them to death simultaneously, but the trick is on
78040	84120	y'all I don't have a mirror or a bathroom unless you count the streets of the city that
84120	85120	is.
85120	89720	Remember, if you want to write up something for your wolf to howl, tag at pretending pod
89720	94920	on Instagram or Twitter, tag pretended to be people on Facebook, or write a 5 star review
94920	99800	on iTunes and email us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.
99800	103640	If more of your friends listen to the show, you'll have even more stuff to talk about
103640	110680	that completely alienates y'all from the normals and here at 694.2, well we think that's
110680	112280	just swell.
112280	119160	Also the contest happening over on the subreddit ends at 11.59pm central time on September
119160	125640	23rd, if you are listening to this on September 23rd that means it's all over tonight baby,
125640	127440	get cracka lacking my pups.
127440	132680	All entries have a shot at winning a D&D 5 edition starter set and the winner will receive
132720	137100	a hardback slip case set of Delta Green the Role Playing Game.
137100	141480	The winners will be announced next week on episode 46.
141480	146120	Speaking of pretending to be people, it's time for the news.
146120	152840	Last time, a whole lot of plot developed just in time for the main event.
152840	158520	Get ready y'all, for real, cause this shit, this shit is popping off like beef stroking
158520	159520	off.
159520	164880	Going strong like Dijon, other food references.
164880	166160	Are you ready?
166160	172800	Because taking us now to the scrap pit is kudzu baby with no back bone.
189520	200640	Y'all ready for this?
200640	207000	Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, and Oz Mayhem Wolf walk up the stairs and into the lights and
207000	209280	sounds of the arena.
209280	215720	This colossal room is circular and funnels downward at least 10 stories.
215760	221480	There are thousands of seats surrounding a massive covered cage.
221480	227440	Think the Octagon from UFC but it's 50 yards across and has a bubble looking rounded top
227440	231880	on it that is entirely made of a crystal clear material.
231880	238980	Aggressively loud dubstep is blaring, strobe lights are making the entire experience otherworldly
238980	244360	as green and red and blue lasers swing wildly around the room.
244360	249940	This place feels like futuristic Las Vegas filled with the spirit of all of Vin Diesel's
249940	254360	films if they were tarred and feathered, but the tar is replaced by Red Bull and the feathers
254360	256400	are replaced by cocaine.
256400	263720	There's an enormous logo in the center of the arena floor that says in all caps, the
263720	265660	scrap pit.
265660	272680	And all around the scrap pit in a massive circle are the repeated words, planet juggernaut,
272680	279240	hanging above the bubble is a gigantic circular jumbotron showing a countdown timer blinking
279240	287340	away and flashing the words, Oz Mayhem Wolf and Friends vs Planet Juggernaut.
287340	294280	The music lowers just a bit and a voice says, welcome one and all to a night you will never
294280	301320	forget a fight that'll make you lose your shit alright because nothing is ever left
301320	303640	in the scrap pit.
303640	309840	I am your host and emcee for the evening, Nick Nichols, and as always, I am joined by
309840	310840	my brother.
310840	315240	Hey everybody, it's me, Nick Nichols, here with my brother, Nick Nichols.
315240	318800	I'm Nick Nichols, joined by my brother, Nick.
318800	323020	Welcome to the scrap pit, we've got a hell of a show for you this evening.
323020	324100	What do you think, Nick?
324100	328520	It is an honor and a pleasure to see such bloodsport on a beautiful sunny day in the
328520	329520	city.
329520	335740	A vast circle in the floor in the arena opens up and from below, planet juggernaut slowly
335740	338600	raises into the scrap pit.
338600	340900	Thomas raises his hands in the air.
340900	346640	The amphitheater explodes with noise, cheers, boos, fucked up people just screaming their
346640	354520	lungs out and this thing is a shiny metal sphere 20 feet tall with two metallic arms
354520	359280	extending from either side and Thomas just slammed his fist together which is what he
359280	364980	described doing when he went into the machine but here's the catch, Thomas, you've never
364980	371640	been a planet juggernaut before and I want to give Justin a reason to roll some dice.
371640	380200	So, Justin is going to roll a D100 and in order for you to control your body that you're
380200	384240	now in, you have to roll under whatever he rolls.
384240	388240	Now you don't have to do this every round, you just have to do this until you succeed
388240	392900	and then you're fully in control but it might take a couple rounds for you to get used to
392900	396800	this new body or you might be a notch.
396800	398840	You might be a notch-ral.
398840	401120	You might, you might be a prodigy.
401120	402960	Alright, roll me bitch.
402960	407420	Justin, go ahead and roll, let's see what Thomas has to roll underneath to slam his
407420	408420	arms together.
408420	409420	That's a 50.
409420	411440	We got a straight up 50-50 shot here.
411440	412440	64.
412880	420240	In Planet Juggernaut, his arms are like outstretched in a very awkward way and one of them goes
420240	425800	to swing at the other one to pound its fist into the hand and misses completely, therefore
425800	427800	hugging itself.
427800	432440	Clark Bishop, regardless of whether or not you think this robot should be hugging itself
432440	440120	or slamming its fist together, you are in a Colosseum dome fighting pit against a 20-foot
440120	441120	tall robot.
441120	442720	I need you to roll a sanity.
442720	445440	Keith Vigna, you are already gonzo beans.
445440	449640	I am gonzo beans, baby.
449640	452040	I fail and above my power.
452040	453880	Alright, that is really handy.
453880	457000	I need you to roll a d6.
457000	458000	A 1.
458000	459000	You lose one sanity.
459000	460000	I hit my breaking point.
460000	461960	You hit your breaking point.
461960	467960	So fun thing for a breaking point, this late in the game we're going to give you another
467960	473400	mania from the sample mania's table in the Call of Cthulhu 7th edition rulebook.
473400	482000	So I'm going to have you roll three times and we will choose which mania you will take.
482000	489160	A 93, a 19, and an 8.
489160	496960	Alright, 93 is Thanatomania, which is a belief that one is cursed by death magic.
496960	499640	That belief does not seem irrational.
499640	507800	19 is Bibliomania, the obsession with books and or reading.
507800	511800	Also extremely fitting, but perhaps not in this current state.
511800	520700	And number 8 is spelled A-I-L-U-R-O mania, so I'm going to go with aileromania, which
520700	523880	is the abnormal fondness for cats.
523880	529720	Gosh, I wish I would have got that one earlier.
529720	534160	Old Doug Jacobs would have had a field day.
534160	537560	I'm going to go with the cursed death magic.
537560	546120	I just pictured you and Doug Jacobs doing a three-legged race, or doing one of the hop
546120	548000	like when you wear a potato sack.
548000	549000	What's that called?
549000	550000	A three-legged race.
550000	551560	That's a potato sack race.
551560	554880	Yeah, three-legged race is where you tie your middle two legs together.
554880	558760	They were really on the nose with those names when they came up with those, so you chose
558760	560400	which one?
560400	561920	That he thinks he's cursed by death magic.
561920	562920	Yeah, of course.
562920	564240	That absolutely makes sense.
564240	571360	So you are now, believe yourself to A, be god, A god, B, be cursed by death magic, which
571360	578800	has got to be a rough thing for a god to feel, and 3, you rolled over your power.
578800	587000	And my guess is you are a lot closer to Keith Vigna and Oz Mayhem Wolf than you are to Planet
587000	588000	Juggernaut.
588000	592800	As the round begins, round one, it is your turn.
592800	595080	This fight's going to end without Thomas rolling a die.
595080	598280	I just murder all the people around me.
598280	604880	Yeah, because of the sanity thing, I'm going to have to dive at whichever one's closest.
604880	607280	Let's roll a 50-50 shot here.
607280	610480	I'll roll a D100 and I'll be under 50.
610480	611480	Perfect.
611480	616640	84, so I'm going after Oz.
616640	619240	So Clark is dressed from the room.
619240	625000	He picked up a bomb squad suit, the suits that are really heavily padded with a helmet
625000	626000	and everything.
626000	627000	He's wearing that.
627000	630040	But he also picked up these pneumatic gloves.
630040	633800	So think Batman, I think, in one of the Dark Knights had them.
633800	634800	Absolutely.
634800	638880	He's going against his forearm strength and finger grip strength, and he's just going
638880	643720	to lunge straight at Oz, and he's going to try and maybe rip his head off.
643720	650020	Okay, Oz is going to roll Awareness to see if he's ready for this attack, and he's not.
650020	652520	So he's not going to roll against you.
652520	655080	You just get to roll an attack on Oz Mayhem Wolf.
655080	658240	So go ahead and roll, what would you call that, unarmed combat?
658240	663640	That was the plan when I decided on one of those gloves, yeah.
663640	668200	I'm guessing you have a higher unarmed combat than you do have a melee, is that correct?
668200	669200	Correct to my name.
669200	670200	Alright, well.
670200	672880	Let's see what that roll is.
672880	674600	That's a zero zero three.
674600	676480	Holy shit, that's a success?
676480	683280	Yeah, so theoretically if I'm lunging at him, I'm trying to maybe snap his neck.
683280	686080	Theoretically trying to snap his neck.
686080	689600	Which is a real bummer for Joe, but Clark is going to love it.
689600	690600	Okay.
690600	692040	What do you think, D8?
692040	696240	Do you know what a normal unarmed combat roll damage is?
696240	698800	Probably like a D6 or a D4.
698800	702240	Then like a D8 or a D12 would be what I'm thinking.
702240	706480	Rules knowledge is why people listen to Pretending to be People.
706480	707480	I'm rolling a D8.
707480	711840	I just think it's funny that you're like, a punch, I don't know, probably.
711840	712840	The most baseline thing.
712840	715800	Standard unarmed, you could say.
715800	717280	I rolled a five.
717280	719560	Alright, Oz Mayhem Wolf.
719560	724720	He's wearing some padding, so he's not going to take all of that damage, but you come up
724720	728760	and do you want to describe what you try to do to him here?
728760	732720	Because you're not snapping his neck, but you are going to put him in a compromising
732720	733720	position.
733720	734720	Physically.
734720	739320	I'll get him in a headlock, and because Clark hasn't snapped many necks in his life, he's
739320	743280	trying to turn in a certain way, and maybe I'm just giving him real bad neck strain.
743280	744280	Real bad Charlie Wars.
744280	746240	Real bad Charlie Wars.
746240	752920	There's a skin burn all around his neck there, and with that, it's Planet Juggernaut's turn.
752920	753920	Thomas?
753920	757520	First, I want to look around at the crowd.
757520	761560	Is Marvin Glass, or is the Emperor in his box anywhere?
761560	762560	Interesting.
762560	768160	You actually see a box that looks like it would be the suite where Marvin Glass would
768160	771640	be, and it is currently curtained off.
771640	772640	Okay.
772920	779080	A tiny helicopter blade pops out of the top of Planet Juggernaut's head, and it rises
779080	785960	about three feet off the ground, and it's kind of like...
785960	787720	Let's see if we can actually get that going.
787720	790280	Justin, go ahead and roll a D100.
790280	791280	That's just him turning on.
791280	793060	That's not what I want to do.
793060	795580	It'll still play.
795580	799440	He rolled a 36, Thomas, so you're going to need to roll under a 36.
799440	801840	Yeah, no, this is a great mechanic.
801840	802840	64.
802840	812520	When I'm 36 and your blade, helicopter chopper blade comes up, and it starts going, but it's
812520	815280	going very conkily and slowly.
815280	817440	Wait, I thought I had to roll over 36.
817440	818440	I'm sorry.
818440	822960	I would have rolled differently.
822960	824560	I had the wrong intent in these dice.
824560	827720	But that's not the completion of your turn, so go ahead and...
828240	831360	I'm just saying, I could have Reiki'd these dudes into...
831360	836360	All right.
836360	837520	Do you have warm hands right now?
837520	838520	I do.
838520	839600	Then roll heat, baby.
839600	843040	Before Justin rolls, tell me what you're trying to finish with this turn here.
843040	844120	You're not going to lift off the ground.
844120	846120	I just wanted to activate.
846120	847120	Gotcha.
847120	849760	Then you failed miserably, and it is Keith's turn.
849760	850760	Okay.
850760	852400	No, no, no.
852400	853400	Tell me...
853840	858120	He said it popped out, and it's just flying janky, so you can mess with that idea.
858120	860120	All right.
860120	862720	I want to shoot him with my laser eyes.
862720	865120	Oh, fuck.
865120	869840	Who are you aiming at?
869840	871280	I'm aiming at you, Luke.
871280	872280	Okay.
872280	873280	I figured.
873280	874280	Right at Keith, Vigna.
874280	875640	Go ahead and roll Justin first.
875640	877280	Let's see if this'll...
877280	878280	19.
878280	882800	Can he roll under a 19, Thomas?
883800	884800	Five.
884800	886800	Hell yeah, dude.
886800	887800	Baby.
887800	888800	All right.
888800	891400	So you've got laser eyes.
891400	894840	What's that look like on your big, metal, shiny, boar body?
894840	897840	Well, it looks like that villain from Sonic.
897840	898840	What is that dude's name?
898840	899840	Dr. Eggman.
899840	900840	Dr. Eggman.
900840	901840	So imagine like that.
901840	902840	Dr. Robotnik, if you're nasty.
902840	903840	Oh, Robotnik.
903840	904840	Yeah.
904840	910440	Just imagine those eyes just like glowing and then shooting lasers out of them at Keith,
910440	911440	Vigna.
911440	912440	Absolutely.
913080	914080	40% that we talked about.
914080	915080	40%.
915080	916080	40%.
916080	920840	Keith, are you going to try to react with a offensive action or are you going to try
920840	922480	to dodge in some way?
922480	924920	Yeah, I'm going to try to jump out of the way.
924920	931920	I have, in addition to the same bomb squad gear that Clark has on, I have these...
931920	938080	I wrote down gump leg braces, but they're super jump slash super run braces on my legs.
938080	939080	All right.
939080	940920	So I'm going to try to just jump out of the way.
940920	943960	So what is your dodge skill?
943960	944960	Base is 30.
944960	953600	So we'll give you a plus 40 for your cool jumping stuff.
953600	954600	I got a three.
954600	955600	You rolled a three, Thomas.
955600	956600	You're going to roll against...
956600	958760	I just have to roll over that?
958760	960240	Over it and under 40.
960240	961240	Yeah.
961240	962240	84.
962240	963240	Oof.
963240	964240	So...
964240	965240	So I jump out of the way.
965240	967640	As lasers shoot out of the eyes of Planet Jugger and I...
967640	970480	What kind of surface is on the, like, what's on the ground here?
970480	974040	I think like a sterile, shiny metal surface.
974040	975040	Okay.
975040	976600	So it, like, scorches.
976600	977600	Yeah.
977600	978600	Yeah.
978600	979600	And it makes, like, cool little metalworking.
979600	980600	Star Wars sparks.
980600	981600	It's got little...
981600	983000	It's got the Planet Juggernaut logo.
983000	984000	Like...
984000	985000	Ooh.
985000	986000	Yeah.
986000	987000	That's why...
987000	989200	That's why it never hits, because it's really more for effect.
989200	990200	It's much cool.
990200	991200	Can you describe...
991200	992200	Much cool.
992200	993200	Much cool.
993200	998300	Can you describe, I guess, Planet Juggernaut himself, but especially when you say it shoots
998300	999300	out of its eyes.
999300	1001020	Where did we see those lasers come from?
1001020	1003020	The head part, you would be like, oh, that's...
1003020	1004020	That's the head.
1004020	1005020	Like, toward the top?
1005020	1006020	Towards the top.
1006020	1007020	Yeah.
1007020	1008020	If it's a big circle, it's where the eyes might be.
1008020	1009020	Yeah.
1009020	1010020	Which from...
1010020	1011020	If it's a big circle, it could be in the middle.
1011020	1012020	Not like a smiley face.
1012020	1013020	More like a Pac-Man.
1013020	1014020	Got it.
1014020	1015020	But with now a giant mouth.
1015020	1016020	Just tiny laser eyes.
1016020	1017020	Nice.
1017020	1018020	Yeah.
1018020	1019020	Oh, actually, I want a giant Pac-Man mouth.
1019020	1023980	That can open up later, baby.
1023980	1029220	Keith Vigna, it is your turn after dodging out of the way with your cool jumping boots.
1029220	1031700	I am flying through the air.
1031700	1033780	So mid-air, I want to pull out...
1033780	1039740	I've got a saw launcher that has diamond-bladed saws that shoot out of it, and I want to aim
1039740	1048000	that over at Planet Juggernaut, and I want to just mid-mass shoot a saw at him.
1048000	1049000	Like a buzzsaw?
1049000	1050000	Like a circular saw?
1050000	1051000	Like a circular saw, yeah.
1051000	1052000	Okay, gotcha.
1052000	1054940	So go ahead and roll firearms for me.
1054940	1055940	Planet Juggernaut.
1055940	1057460	That's a 42 on a 70.
1057460	1062420	You can try to make a dodge maneuver here, but you'll have to critically succeed in order
1062420	1063900	to dodge.
1063900	1065180	Okay.
1065180	1066420	No.
1066420	1071400	Keith, describe what this looks like as you're flying through the air.
1071400	1073300	You pull out a saw shooting through.
1073300	1078100	I see the lasers start to form in his eyes, and I can see that they're aimed mostly at
1078100	1079100	me.
1079100	1084460	So I jump out of the way, and I'm about 10 feet up in the air, going over to the side
1084460	1093060	away from Oz and Clark, and I pull out, kind of looks like a giant crossbow, and it has
1093060	1098500	a giant circular saw on it, and you can tell that the edges are shiny.
1098500	1107220	And I aim it, shoot it, and it flies circular, just shooting right at Planet Juggernaut,
1107220	1108220	and it whacks.
1108220	1109220	All right.
1109220	1112780	Call that 1d8 plus 3.
1112780	1115260	Put that down.
1115260	1116820	That's 8 plus 3.
1116820	1118380	Oh, smacks.
1118380	1125340	So this blade fully embeds itself into one of the eyes, or where the laser came out of
1125340	1126340	Planet Juggernaut.
1126340	1127660	He said midsection.
1127660	1133700	The midsection of a face is where the eyes are.
1133700	1135620	The nose is the face's belly button.
1135620	1136620	Take away my laser eyes.
1136620	1137620	No, no, no.
1137620	1138620	It doesn't take him away.
1138620	1145180	It is going to take down the damage a little bit, and it embeds itself fully in there as
1145180	1146860	you take 11 damage.
1146860	1147860	Nice.
1147860	1155020	It is Oz Mayhem Wolf's turn, and he is confused.
1155020	1163380	He is going to run, and as he runs, he's going to try to jump at Planet Juggernaut.
1163380	1167500	So he is going to roll.
1167500	1175100	If you want to dodge, you can oppose this roll with a dodge roll, Thomas.
1175100	1179340	I crit failed.
1179340	1185860	So basically, he has these boots on that, as he's running toward you, as he's about
1185860	1193420	to take off, he clicks a button and a little thing in his hand, much like one would click
1193420	1196140	the ignition of a bomb or something like that.
1196140	1201060	And as soon as he does so, he gets prepared and ready to jump.
1201060	1204500	He barely makes it out one inch off the ground.
1204500	1210820	He comes out of his shoes, and his boots are stuck to the ground underneath him, and he
1210820	1217500	falls on his face in front of him, halfway in between the group and Planet Juggernaut.
1217500	1222260	And the crowd goes wild.
1222260	1226740	And the crowd goes wild after that crazy first round, Mick.
1226740	1228220	What did we see out there?
1228220	1230820	We saw Planet Juggernaut really struggling.
1230820	1233020	Yeah, you know, Mick.
1233020	1234020	Wait.
1234020	1238860	I'm Mick, you're Mick, we're all Mick for Nichols.
1238860	1244820	You know, Planet Juggernaut had a 97% murder rate in the first 45 seconds before this match.
1244820	1245820	Has he lost it, folks?
1245820	1246820	I don't know.
1246820	1251420	Well, we're only six seconds in, so we will find out shortly, but we have an interesting
1251420	1257900	thing happen with seemingly one of Oz Mayhem Wolf's friends turning on him in the very
1257900	1259260	first moments of the fight.
1259260	1263900	Let's see if that interbreeding continues throughout this contest.
1263900	1265300	Who knows?
1265300	1269700	You know what's crazy is we thought Planet Juggernaut lacked humanity, but I'm just not
1269700	1277820	seeing it from these three out here today.
1277820	1282180	And with that, let's go ahead and look at the board as we take a quick second to go
1282180	1286060	to our kiss cam here in the scrap pit.
1286060	1292220	Looking up, you see on the jumbotron, they're showing just these two dudes in the audience
1292220	1296500	who are both cheering and one looks a lot like Luke and the other one looks a lot like
1296500	1297500	Joe.
1297500	1300740	And the camera zooms in on you guys.
1300740	1302740	They look at each other tentatively.
1302740	1306940	Oh, that's a long one.
1306940	1309340	Looks like there's a lot of passion in that bedroom.
1309340	1310340	All right.
1310340	1315940	Let's get back to the action and see what happens in round two.
1315940	1322140	Clark Bishop, you begin the action in round two.
1322140	1326380	So I'm feeling better now after I got that aggression out of me and I want to yell to
1326380	1327380	Oz.
1327380	1328380	I'm sorry.
1328380	1329380	I didn't know we were on the same side.
1329380	1330380	I get it now.
1330380	1331380	I got it.
1331380	1332380	We're good.
1332380	1333380	We're good.
1333380	1334980	It was like extremely rude of you to come at me like that.
1334980	1336860	I didn't appreciate it one bit.
1336860	1337860	It's my fault.
1337860	1338860	Didn't understand.
1338860	1339860	I got it now.
1339860	1340860	All right.
1340860	1344420	And I pull out my rocket launcher that I have strapped to my back and I'm not aiming at
1344420	1345420	the body.
1345420	1346780	I'm aiming at one of the arms.
1346780	1348340	Ooh, interesting.
1348340	1353420	So that'll be a called shot and I need you to roll a firearms check for me.
1353420	1355020	What does the cold shot do to me?
1355020	1356200	Negative 40.
1356200	1358620	That's negative 40 for a head shot, but it says negative 20.
1358620	1361700	I don't have a head, so I think it should be negative 40.
1361700	1362700	That makes sense.
1362700	1365000	Up to you as far as, is that equivalent?
1365000	1366880	Let's call it negative 40.
1366880	1367880	Cool.
1367880	1373520	Thomas, what do you, what is planet juggernaut doing to oppose this before we hear that role?
1373520	1378280	Planet juggernaut puts like one of his arms up in front of his like laser eyes and like
1378280	1381680	tries to swat at the missile no matter what like happens.
1381680	1382680	Love it.
1382680	1383680	We'll see.
1383680	1385640	All right, let's hear that role.
1385640	1388120	It's a fail because of the minus 40.
1388120	1389120	It's a 74.
1389120	1394280	So he, he just like nimbly just like flicks it and it goes like tumbling into part of
1394280	1395280	the crowd.
1395280	1401640	It goes tumbling up into part of the dome that's up there and when it hits the dome,
1401640	1407480	it actually, the entire like floor that you're on and the dome itself rattles and it like
1407480	1413600	sends reverberations all the way through and you hear just this massive roar from the crowd
1413600	1416240	as they get fucking amped.
1416240	1421240	It's like seeing a wreck, but nobody got hurt yet because it's going to happen later.
1421240	1422840	Probably the hurt, the hurt will happen later.
1422840	1423840	I would imagine.
1423840	1426440	And with that it is a planet juggernaut's turn.
1426440	1427440	Okay.
1427440	1432600	He, he putters out with his little helicopter directly over Oz mayhem wolf and then turns
1432600	1434600	off the helicopter.
1434600	1441620	All right, so I, you don't have to do anything in order to succeed at that and I will simply
1441620	1444580	roll a dodge out here in front of you.
1444580	1453140	He's going to turn on a defensive mask on his helmet that basically clogs your sensors
1453140	1457500	that show you where people are on the field of battle.
1457500	1464540	And so if he can roll under a 40% actually because you did it, I'll give him a 20% so
1464540	1470580	he's only got a 20% chance to dodge and he fails with a 60.
1470580	1477760	A red goo just comes out from, so that will, that will happen.
1477760	1481260	We will not see the effects of that yet.
1481260	1485560	Um, because Oz mayhem wolf is out of sight, but not out of my mind.
1485560	1486860	I feel something.
1486860	1492500	It's like a leg or something caught in some of my gears feels weird.
1492500	1499920	For my second attack action, I want to punch Joe going to punch the old Clark Bishop who
1499920	1503900	just shot a rocket launcher in your direction.
1503900	1507900	Clark you've already attacked, so you can roll a dodge if you would like to oppose.
1507900	1509460	I would like to.
1509460	1514700	If you have any sort of a thing on you that can help you mechanically, holler that out
1514700	1515700	now.
1515700	1520160	Well, I did write down that I've got the same kind of pneumatic legs as Keith and give yourself
1520160	1524280	a plus 40 on that Dodge, which takes your Dodge up to 90.
1524280	1525280	Holy shit.
1525660	1529160	Thomas playing at juggernaut is rolling a 60%.
1529160	1530160	I believe.
1530160	1531160	Is that right?
1531160	1532160	Uh, yeah.
1532160	1533160	All right.
1533160	1534820	So is this, what is this contested on?
1534820	1539540	The punching is just your standard fighting skill for punching.
1539540	1540940	Right.
1540940	1544580	So I passed that, but how am I ever going to pass a 90%?
1544580	1545580	It's a contest.
1545580	1549060	So you just did cause I rolled a nine.
1549060	1550660	I passed, but I was lower than him.
1550660	1551660	Oh, I see how that works.
1551660	1552660	Okay.
1552660	1554660	How will he ever beat that?
1554660	1555860	I get it.
1555860	1560600	So describe your action as a Clark Bishop tries to jump out of the way.
1560600	1562440	So this all kind of happens in one move.
1562440	1569900	Like he's puttering over towards Oz and he like flicks the rocket as he's coming down
1569900	1571040	onto him.
1571040	1573880	And then he kind of like Springs up back towards Clark.
1573880	1578740	You see the little helicopter blade where again, he's just had his hand up from where
1578740	1582440	he flipped the thing and he just brings it straight down at Clark.
1582440	1583440	Oh, okay.
1583440	1585440	Roll 66 for damage.
1585440	1590860	Oh no, wait, does my body armor help me?
1590860	1591860	Yeah.
1591860	1592860	Okay.
1592860	1594780	You'll get five DR damage resistance.
1594780	1596780	Still fucked.
1596780	1608660	16 to Malort for math, quick math, 10, 16, 18, 21, 23.
1608660	1613420	What is your, so 23 minus five, 18, 18.
1613420	1615960	And what is, what was your health at before?
1615960	1616960	Uh, 26.
1616960	1619960	So I'm now at eight.
1619960	1623120	Do you want to spend luck to reduce some of that damage?
1623120	1624120	Yeah.
1624120	1625120	You've gotten a lot of luck.
1625120	1626120	Don't you?
1626120	1627120	Yeah.
1627120	1630720	It's 10 whole points to reduce it by one D six, which isn't that big a deal if you're
1630720	1632840	rolling 12 of them at a time.
1632840	1633840	Six of them.
1633840	1637820	Six, six D six, not 12, but that's literally one sixth.
1637820	1640080	I'll use 10 luck to mitigate it by a D six.
1640080	1641080	All right.
1641080	1642080	Roll that D six.
1642080	1643380	I got three back.
1643380	1644380	All right.
1644380	1648340	So I'm at 11 and I'm at 50 luck.
1648340	1649340	Jesus.
1649340	1656900	Motherfucker sitting at like 60 luck and it's like, I'm going to spend 10 Keith Vigna.
1656900	1658300	It is your turn.
1658300	1659300	Okay.
1659300	1665740	I'm going to jump up kind of closer to planet juggernaut and I want to use my suction gloves
1665740	1671140	that I have on to suction on to the wall, maybe like 10 feet above him.
1671280	1677360	And then I want to pull out my nitro thrower and aim it at him and try to freeze his propeller.
1677360	1679800	Fucking dope.
1679800	1680800	Very good.
1680800	1681800	Okay.
1681800	1690040	Uh, so you can roll a firearms check in order to try to attain that goal.
1690040	1693240	Thomas, do you want to combat it in a Dodge movement?
1693240	1694240	Yes.
1697240	1698240	Fair.
1698240	1700240	I got a 65 on a 70.
1700340	1701340	Oh shit.
1701340	1702340	All right.
1702340	1707700	So describe what happens is you basically, so I go from where I landed after shooting
1707700	1714740	that saw, I jump up over about 10 feet above juggernaut and about five or 10 feet away
1714740	1716420	from him as well.
1716420	1722900	I use one hand with a suction glove to suction on to the dome.
1722900	1730220	I pull out the nitro thrower and I just let it unload all over the top of planet juggernaut.
1731200	1732200	Yeah.
1732200	1744880	And as you shower planet juggernaut with your nitro, you render his ability to hover
1744880	1745880	useless.
1745880	1746880	Yeah.
1746880	1747880	Nice.
1747880	1755120	You see another little propeller pop up, but it takes a second to whir around.
1755140	1762180	You guys look over, uh, you saw planet juggernaut bounce essentially off of Oz mayhem Wolf and
1762180	1770360	looking in the dent planet juggernaut left in the floor, you see crawling out from the
1770360	1780860	dent is Oz mayhem Wolf and he looks fucking rough and he crawls and he sits cross-legged
1780860	1783340	and tries to put his boots back on.
1783560	1786960	And that's the end of round two.
1786960	1790080	Nick Nichols, we have seen some stuff today.
1790080	1794760	First we have Clark Bishop shooting a rocket launcher that gets flicked right out of the
1794760	1795760	way.
1795760	1796760	What'd you think about that one, Nick?
1796760	1800520	You know, that scrappy fellow really is impressing me today with his inability to do much of
1800520	1802880	anything useful at all for his team.
1802880	1806560	Planet juggernaut smashed that scrappy fellow like a plastic bag filled with warm ground
1806560	1807560	up pork.
1807560	1810240	I don't know about you, but I am positively starving.
1810240	1812680	I am absolutely hungry now.
1812900	1815020	Thank you for that delicious analogy.
1815020	1820860	And then planet juggernaut just sits right on top of Oz mayhem Wolf before bouncing off
1820860	1824380	to slap Clark Bishop right on top of the head.
1824380	1829860	I have never seen a man completely disappear under planet juggernaut like that before and
1829860	1830860	emerge alive.
1830860	1833900	It truly was a sight to see.
1833900	1840240	Oz mayhem Wolf is a regular here in the scrap pan and has been ever since his brother got
1840240	1842980	fucked over by Marvin Glass.
1842980	1848820	And then with that one, we saw Keith Vigna, former police officer from contention and
1848820	1853700	a cadet from the city do some very cool movements.
1853700	1856580	What did you think about the stuff that he did?
1856580	1859700	I've heard nothing but horrible things about Keith Vigna.
1859700	1863780	Quite frankly, I am super impressed with his performance today.
1863780	1869420	It has been one dope thing after another from that weird looking dude.
1869420	1875200	Down in the field, we have our correspondent.
1875200	1877840	What's our correspondent's name tonight, Nick Nichols?
1877840	1878840	Who's down there?
1878840	1879840	Who do we got?
1879840	1881200	What kind of correspondent is he?
1881200	1883960	Oh, he's doing the trivia contest today.
1883960	1885440	Jeremiah Jones, I think.
1885440	1891360	Jeremiah Jones is down there and he's got three contestants from the audience and he
1891360	1894720	is ready to interview them now and ask some questions.
1894720	1897000	Let's take it down to Jeremiah.
1897000	1906540	Hi, hey everybody, it's Jeremiah Jones and I'm here with three people who are here to
1906540	1912260	watch the Scrap Pit fight and we're going to try to win some prizes today.
1912260	1916340	If you want to introduce yourselves, what is your name, sir?
1916340	1917340	Woo!
1917340	1920860	I'm David from Akron.
1920860	1924300	We drove 350 miles to be here tonight in the Scrap Pit.
1924300	1926720	I'm rooting for Planet Juggernaut.
1926720	1927720	Woo!
1927720	1931680	Okay, David, thanks for being here and who's next to you here?
1931680	1932960	I'm little Davey.
1932960	1934520	I'm David's son.
1934520	1938280	Speak up, little Davey.
1938280	1941880	He made me drive the whole way here because he was drinking.
1941880	1942880	Woo!
1942880	1943880	Woo!
1943880	1946560	And you, sir, there on the end.
1946560	1947720	Hello there.
1947720	1949200	I'm a fan of Oz.
1949200	1951000	I came to see everybody he's in.
1951000	1952520	I love him so.
1952740	1955860	Okay, so we've got some pretty cool prizes for you guys.
1955860	1961180	If you could answer these questions, then you might win a t-shirt.
1961180	1963140	It's got Planet Juggernaut on it.
1963140	1965580	Would you like that tonight, guys?
1965580	1966580	Woo!
1966580	1970300	Yeah, I'll give it to my dad if I win.
1970300	1975500	If I win, I'll give it to his dad as well.
1975500	1978940	I don't see any way I can lose tonight.
1978940	1979940	Okay, David.
1979940	1982460	Everything's coming up, Dave.
1982480	1987600	Dave, it seems like you've got a really good chance of winning a t-shirt here.
1987600	1999120	First question, on which day of the week are Americans most likely to get blackout drunk?
1999120	2003080	Any day that ends in Y, brother.
2003080	2004920	But seriously, Friday?
2004920	2006460	Yeah, yep.
2006460	2007460	It's Friday.
2007460	2011560	It is Friday and you win a t-shirt with Planet Juggernaut on it.
2011700	2015620	David, close your ears.
2015620	2019540	I honestly don't remember more Fridays than I do, if you know what I mean.
2019540	2021540	I personally don't know what you mean.
2021540	2022540	I remember everything.
2022540	2026140	I slap him really hard on the back.
2026140	2027700	Woo!
2027700	2031620	I remember my childbirth.
2031620	2033100	David Jr., it's your turn.
2033100	2035060	We've got a trivia question.
2035060	2036060	It's little Davey.
2036060	2038420	Oh, little Davey.
2038440	2042560	I've got a question for you here.
2042560	2046200	What color is a bird?
2046200	2050760	Um, uh, blue.
2050760	2051760	That's right.
2051760	2052760	That's right.
2052760	2053760	You get a t-shirt.
2053760	2054760	There are blue birds.
2054760	2055760	Hey, yeah.
2055760	2057140	Way to go, little dude.
2057140	2062000	Little Davey gives it to his dad and then kind of cowers away.
2062000	2064000	Dave wipes a tear from his eye.
2064000	2065720	A single tear.
2065720	2067320	I love you, dad.
2067320	2068740	I love you, little Davey.
2068740	2069740	That's right, Ning Nickels.
2069740	2075100	We had to make some of the questions a bit easier because people were not sober enough
2075100	2077500	to answer proper trivia questions.
2077500	2079020	Let's go back down to that third question.
2079020	2080180	What do you think about all that, Nick?
2080180	2083780	I just want to hear Jeremiah Johnson say more things.
2083780	2091140	Jeremiah Johnson here, and I'm reporting to ask this question of this man who is here
2091140	2094740	to support his friend from the Motherland.
2094740	2095740	May Oz Wolf.
2095740	2096740	Hey, Mayhem.
2096740	2098160	Oh, I'm so sorry.
2098160	2099160	What's your name?
2099160	2101160	It's, uh, Farsi.
2101160	2105560	Yeah, Farsi, thanks for coming down.
2105560	2107760	I don't, I don't know Oz.
2107760	2110000	I just, I just identify with him.
2110000	2118640	So the fan of Oz, Mayhem, Wolf, and, um, the, the question that we have tonight is, are
2118640	2120480	you having a good time?
2120820	2126340	I, I, I was, and then, uh, the juggernaut, he landed on Oz, and I'm, uh, so worried.
2126340	2127340	That's right.
2127340	2128340	That's right.
2128340	2129340	You are worried.
2129340	2133480	I can tell from my senses of your body.
2133480	2134480	You won a t-shirt.
2134480	2139260	All right, thank you, Jeremiah Johnson.
2139260	2143100	Nick Nickels, what did we think about all this trivia we're having around here today?
2143100	2148520	You know, you love seeing a father and a son bond so much, and you love seeing a superfan.
2148520	2151700	You see them like on camera, like Dave and little Davey.
2151700	2154000	Little Davey is on his Dave's shoulders.
2154000	2159700	When I'm like, I'm like, give him a woo, little Davey, give him a woo.
2159700	2160700	Wow.
2160700	2163220	True parental greatness.
2163220	2166720	You see me like giving him my beer, like up on my shoulders.
2166720	2171940	It's really heartwarming to see a father who knows how to take care of a young boy in this
2171940	2172940	country.
2172940	2173940	All right.
2173940	2180400	The action here in round three of the Scrap It.
2180400	2185520	And starting off round three, we've got Clark Bishop.
2185520	2187660	Clark Bishop starts round three.
2187660	2190760	So I'm kind of under the hand of the thing now.
2190760	2197360	I want to try and wriggle out and use a magnetic trap that I brought with me.
2197360	2201960	I figure I'll set it under where I am right now, hopefully trapping his arm there.
2201960	2202960	Awesome.
2202980	2207180	I was hoping I could use a survival skill for that as far as setting traps go.
2207180	2208180	Sweet.
2208180	2212620	Thomas, does Planet of Juggernaut want to try to dodge out of the way here as this is
2212620	2213620	happening?
2213620	2218460	Well, I didn't imagine that after I punched you, I just left my hand there, but.
2218460	2223760	Close enough for horseshoes, hand grenades, and magnets.
2223760	2225020	Fucking God.
2225020	2226020	I would.
2226020	2228020	I crit fail.
2228880	2235600	You could also say, fuck me, in Clark's, uh, as Clark's character.
2235600	2240120	It's that goddamn death magic curse at me again.
2240120	2241120	Me damn it.
2241120	2245360	Clark Bishop, as you go to set this, what do you have on you?
2245360	2251720	Let's go ahead and say that as you set this trap and start to scuttle backwards, the trap
2251720	2256760	sets earlier than you thought it was going to and your rocket launcher flies out of your
2256780	2262140	hands and sticks to the ground ahead of you, out of your grasp.
2262140	2263500	That makes sense.
2263500	2265680	Planet Juggernaut, Europe.
2265680	2268380	Planet Juggernaut seems eerily still.
2268380	2269380	Oh no.
2269380	2270380	Oh no.
2270380	2271380	Hell yeah.
2271380	2282380	You see, you see like a faint light coming out of like some seams in him and some vents
2282440	2286200	are opening up and like letting some steam out.
2286200	2290440	Uh, and you hear, you hear this like worrying.
2290440	2302200	It's just kind of charging up Keith Vigner, I'm going to unsuction from the dome and kick
2302200	2310040	off the dome to get, try to get to the far end, as far away as I can from a planet juggernaut.
2310060	2319700	And I want to set up a mounted 50 cal machine gun with armor piercing bullets and let go.
2319700	2325060	So first things first, I need you to roll a dexterity because when you put your feet
2325060	2333300	on the dome, your feet feel an adhesive and you are stuck to the dome.
2333300	2335080	Yeah, I failed my dexterity roll.
2335080	2338260	And you cannot release from this position.
2338260	2342040	You are now hanging by your feet on the side of the dome.
2342040	2344680	Can I still use an attack or is that?
2344680	2347440	You will be at a negative 40 percent.
2347440	2348440	Okay.
2348440	2351520	I'll launch another saw at him.
2351520	2355880	Go ahead and roll that firearms check for me.
2355880	2357560	Is it at a negative 40?
2357560	2358560	It is indeed.
2358560	2359560	So what's that make your firearms?
2359560	2362200	30, but I rolled a 13.
2362200	2366440	Oh, planet juggernaut is currently unable to dodge.
2366440	2368860	So you will roll a success there.
2368860	2370740	What did I have you write down there for damage?
2370740	2371740	G8 plus three.
2371740	2374460	Roll that D8 for me, Lukey boy.
2374460	2376140	That is a four total.
2376140	2377140	Four total?
2377140	2378140	Yeah, one plus three.
2378140	2379580	Well, that explains it.
2379580	2386180	You are hanging upside down, shooting backwards at your target like a sloth with a gun.
2386180	2390260	It kind of like arcs through the air and then kind of like skids off him flying.
2390260	2393220	The armor piercing round does not quite pierce the armor.
2393220	2395220	Well, no, this was the saw blade.
2395360	2396360	Whatever dude.
2396360	2397360	So it leaves a big catch.
2397360	2401360	Yeah, it chops off a little bit of him, but not much.
2401360	2402360	Shing!
2402360	2403360	Shoo!
2403360	2404360	Foo!
2404360	2416840	And with that, it is Oz Mayhem Wolf's turn and he is getting his shoes back on and as
2416840	2424160	he gets his boots back on, he stands up, clicks a button in his left hand and begins running
2424180	2430500	toward Planet Juggernaut once again, hopefully this time in a successful manner.
2430500	2437640	However, as he runs, a panel on the ground lifts up and flings him.
2437640	2441400	So let's see if he can avoid this.
2441400	2442860	He fails his roll.
2442860	2446780	So he gets flung out of the air.
2446780	2452780	He's just running and you see a panel on the floor just launch him and he flies into the
2452800	2456800	dome and gets stuck like a spider in a web.
2456800	2458960	No, spiders don't get stuck on webs.
2458960	2463400	Like a fly in a web.
2463400	2465400	Like not a spider on a web.
2465400	2468400	Like a man in his house.
2468400	2470280	Wait.
2470280	2475560	Stuck to one position where he can only look out into the audience and as he's looking
2475560	2483340	out into the audience, he sees moving past a crowd of allured, yelling, drunk assholes.
2483340	2489180	He sees a very short young woman and a very tall old man, both wearing black suits, white
2489180	2495660	shirts, black ties, black sunglasses, and ill-fitting windbreakers moving through this
2495660	2498580	crowd of nonsensical monsters.
2498580	2502420	You hear a faint, woo, somewhere in the crowd.
2503320	2509640	Many, many, many faint woos as the crowd is going nuts because shit is getting crazy.
2509640	2513720	And that is our third round here in the scrap pit.
2513720	2514720	Boy howdy.
2514720	2522760	Right around we have Clark Bishop, ex-contention police officer, current monster and god thinker
2522760	2524000	of himself.
2524000	2527100	He just cannot get anything off today.
2527100	2529320	His rocket launcher flew right off his back.
2529320	2530320	You know what I have to think?
2530320	2531760	What do you have to think, Nick?
2531760	2536500	I wonder, and you know I truly do wonder, is he cursed by death magic?
2536500	2542660	I think it's 100% possible that this Clark Bishop could indeed be cursed by death magic.
2542660	2547960	And Planet Juggernaut is doing something, ooh, boy howdy, he's got something up his
2547960	2549700	proverbial arms.
2549700	2552900	You know, I'm wondering if he's planning for the big one.
2552900	2558000	Oh, he just might be, and if we get to see him pull this off, boy howdy, would this fight
2558000	2559980	not last much longer.
2559980	2565560	I truly do hope that he hasn't lost his will to murder and he's just hanging out.
2565560	2567640	That would be a sight to see.
2567640	2572180	Any time we can get some humanity out of the robots in this world, I think we should go
2572180	2574120	for it and praise them.
2574120	2576360	And what do you think about that Keith Vigna fella?
2576360	2579800	Well, on this turn, he finally fucked up.
2579800	2584640	We heard that's what he's wanting to do, and he finally got his feet all stucky sticky
2584640	2586620	on the side of the dome.
2586620	2591640	You know, if he's trying to hit Planet Juggernaut, and Planet Juggernaut is indeed resting like
2591640	2597080	some of us think he might be, that would be a really classy move by a really classy guy.
2597080	2602480	Yeah, we got OsmayHipWolf who's trying to make an attack with boots finally on his feet.
2602480	2607440	He just gets flung right into the wall where he gets stuck like a spider on a web.
2607440	2613120	You know, that's crazy, he has been off his game all day today and he is surely disappointing
2613120	2614740	his greatest fan today.
2614740	2618060	Let's go ahead and take a quick moment of silence.
2618060	2625680	Everyone here in the scrap pit remembers our dear brothers, Rich and Richard, right?
2625680	2627360	Dick and Rich Nichols.
2627360	2628880	One of those two works.
2628880	2635640	And they were absolutely proponents of this ring and big security advisors for the making
2635640	2638440	of this massive dome room.
2638440	2644820	And we lost them earlier this week, so we would like to take a quick 30 second moment
2644820	2647140	of silence in their honor.
2668440	2669440	Whoo!
2669440	2670440	Both in silence!
2670440	2671440	Shut the fuck up!
2671440	2672440	Oh my god!
2672440	2673440	No, no!
2673440	2674440	That was 30 seconds!
2674440	2675440	Happy you lost all your humanity's time!
2675440	2691940	That was 30 seconds for your creepy ass brothers, whoo!
2691940	2695120	That man must have known our brothers, they were creepy assholes.
2695120	2698120	Let's get back to the action here in Route 4.
2698120	2699120	What do you say, Dick?
2699120	2712500	Yeah, the crowd is really wanting to see some blood here today and I, you know, I also do.
2712500	2714180	Back to the top of Route 4.
2714180	2715740	Clark Bishop, it's your turn.
2715740	2720380	That trap that shot up and flung Oz, can I see, is it still up?
2720380	2723580	No, the ground immediately went back to where it was.
2723580	2729000	I want to run over to it and knowing that it's there, try to use its angle and momentum
2729000	2732240	to launch me onto Planet Juggernaut.
2732240	2734240	Roll an athletics check.
2734240	2739540	Can I do decks?
2739540	2741040	Roll a dexterity check there, whoo!
2741040	2745400	Oh my god, Dex Shepard would be a pretty good name for a roleplaying deck.
2745400	2750360	I pass a 17 and that would pass both athletics and decks.
2750360	2751360	Alright.
2751360	2756900	Planet Juggernaut is still warming himself, so you will be able to do this real quick.
2756900	2763420	Just want to say, Dex Shepard, be like a, like a, like a thief.
2763420	2764620	Yeah, like a rogue.
2764620	2767380	Yeah, like a rogue who's like a wheelman.
2767380	2768380	What's a wheelman?
2768380	2769780	Like the guy who drives cars.
2769780	2771180	A wheelman!
2771180	2777100	You know, like, some dudes are into legs and some are into butts.
2777100	2778100	He's a real wheelman.
2778100	2779100	He's a wheelman.
2779100	2780100	He's a wheelman.
2780100	2782220	You know that guy, he's a real wheelman.
2782220	2783220	He's the opposite of Pinocchio.
2783220	2785520	I'm saying he fucks cars.
2785520	2786520	He's a wheelman.
2786520	2788520	Look at the muffler on that one.
2788520	2791800	Oh my goodness gracious.
2791800	2794960	So Joe, describe Clark's jump.
2794960	2799960	He's rushing over to that trap and he's got those pneumatic legs on and the pneumatic
2799960	2803720	gloves on and he knows where he's going to land so he kind of jumps onto that trap and
2803720	2809920	it springs up and he flings himself straight at Planet Juggernaut hoping to land kind of
2809920	2810920	on the top of him.
2810920	2816100	And when he does, he's using those pneumatic gloves to kind of like punch inward and try
2816100	2819100	and stabilize himself on the top of it.
2819100	2820100	Oh, cool.
2820100	2823180	Roll strength here.
2823180	2829420	That's a pass, a 35 on a 65.
2829420	2834580	Okay, so describe this exactly how you want it to look.
2834580	2837780	You know when a bodybuilder is like flexing their muscles, he's coming all the way up
2837780	2843180	to the top and then half moons around the side and bam, right into the top dome area
2843180	2844180	there.
2844180	2847120	And I don't know what's inside it so explain to me what my hands pierce maybe.
2847120	2853340	So it would be like a thin metal material that would completely wrap around your fists
2853340	2856000	as you moved them in there.
2856000	2859560	With the purpose of being stabilized on top of it, so I'm holding it kind of like maybe
2859560	2861540	you would hold the horn on the saddle maybe?
2861540	2867640	Stable you are like a horse rider of a horse, Planet Juggernaut.
2867640	2870440	You have taken your time and you are ready to go.
2870440	2876880	Clark Bishop isn't on top of Planet Juggernaut for very long because he starts to feel Planet
2876880	2883720	Juggernaut moving underneath him and he sees the secondary helicopter blade pop out and
2883720	2887440	Planet Juggernaut rises off the ground and then it's weird.
2887440	2891280	It's like the outside surface is spinning around something on the inside, but all of
2891280	2899840	a sudden you're latched on and you're going down a roller coaster and it's spinning slow
2899840	2905560	but then it starts going very fast and then Planet Juggernaut drops to the ground and
2905560	2907280	takes off.
2907280	2909960	You are going to roll, what did we say for this one?
2909960	2911440	3d6 for every one I hit.
2911440	2913280	Did I give you a percentage?
2913280	2915280	The 60 I think.
2915280	2919080	I don't know, actually we didn't do a percentage, I figured maybe people would just try to dodge.
2919080	2922680	I think it's just a dodge, so everybody is going to roll dodge.
2922680	2927760	If you fail your dodge then you take 3d6 of damage.
2927760	2928760	Do I have a dodge?
2928760	2930440	You do indeed and we'll start with you.
2930440	2932280	Or would you try to just disengage?
2932280	2935600	I mean I think if I succeed this dodge that would do it.
2935600	2936600	Exactly.
2941900	2942960	Looks like a failure.
2942960	2945800	It's a crit fail.
2945800	2950920	He can't get his hands out.
2950920	2952000	That's not going to be good.
2952000	2954920	This is karma for all the amazing rolls I've had this whole time.
2954920	2958240	This whole campaign.
2958240	2959920	Joe is going to take 8 points of damage.
2959920	2961120	Shit, what's that put you at now?
2961120	2962720	That puts me at 3 hit points.
2962720	2966560	Alright do you want to use a 10 more luck here or are you going to?
2966560	2968440	Yeah I'll use 10 more for one d6.
2968440	2970560	Alright roll that d6.
2970560	2971560	4.
2971560	2972560	Nice.
2972560	2973560	Alright.
2973560	2975320	So I'm at 7 hit points.
2975320	2977120	Keith Vigna roll that dodge for me baby.
2977120	2979400	So do I just do what my normal dodge is?
2979400	2982960	I don't get any bonus from those legs since I'm stuck probably.
2982960	2985200	You are actually stuck up.
2985200	2986720	So you are out.
2986720	2988760	You're so stuck up.
2988760	2989760	I will actually.
2989760	2990760	I'm going to give you.
2990760	2992640	Finally someone says it.
2992640	2998800	I'm going to give you a plus 40% for being so far out of the way.
2998800	2999800	Yeah.
2999800	3002200	It's 5.
3002200	3006520	Alright so on that success basically Planet Juggernaut like as he's rolling toward you
3006520	3012800	realizes that he can't hit you with how high you are and so bails and goes after Oz Mayhem
3012800	3016080	Wolf who rolls an 83 failing.
3016080	3019880	So roll 3d6 for me Thomas.
3019880	3021600	12.
3021600	3022920	Ouch.
3022920	3026320	Oh wow okay.
3026360	3032960	The ball starts rolling and Clark Bishop can't get his hands out from underneath it and it
3032960	3040520	rolls over him and with the critical fail it continues to roll toward Oz Mayhem Wolf
3040520	3046100	and as it rolls over Oz it splatters him.
3046100	3053920	You actually see just viscera of guts and insides and this black ichor all just kind
3053920	3061680	of like splurt out on either side and there is now a Nickelodeon style splat of dark red
3061680	3067680	on Planet Juggernaut but because of the crit fail as he's continuing to roll Clark Bishop
3067680	3070640	gets rolled over a second time.
3070640	3073880	So I need you to roll 3d6 again.
3073880	3074880	6.
3074880	3077120	6 points of damage and you were at what?
3077120	3081120	7 so I can survive that with one hit point.
3081120	3082840	Spend 10 more luck.
3082840	3084600	I would do that.
3084600	3086560	Yeah what are you saving the luck for?
3086560	3087800	The mechanics.
3087800	3090640	Yeah I mean like.
3090640	3094960	So you can either spend 10 luck to get a d6 more or you can roll a constitution check
3094960	3097380	to see if you stay conscious or unconscious.
3097380	3101600	If you fail the constitution check to stay conscious then you'll have to spend luck to
3101600	3104240	stay conscious.
3104240	3105240	Did that all make sense?
3105240	3109440	It did yeah I am yeah I'm gonna use the d6.
3109440	3111800	10 more luck spent puts you at what?
3111800	3112800	30.
3112800	3114600	He's unable to save himself.
3114600	3117880	3 so I have 4 hit points total.
3117880	3120480	Okay then you don't need to roll a constitution check here.
3120480	3121480	Oh.
3121480	3134480	Right before Osmayhimwolf dies you hear him go no my brother Elby my cousin V.
3134480	3140400	It was a plot point it's a me Osmayhimwolf.
3140400	3143280	All that's cut out.
3143280	3149000	You just hear from the crowd oh.
3149000	3153160	You also hear a very emphatic woo.
3153160	3154560	Keith Vigna it's your turn.
3154560	3159480	Okay I'm gonna try to so where is Juggernaut right now?
3159480	3160480	Rolling around baby.
3160480	3161800	Doing a couple victory laps.
3161800	3169500	Okay I'm going to reposition my feet on this dome to where I'm aimed in towards the inside
3169500	3172740	of the dome so what do I roll to do that dexterity?
3172740	3174120	I wasn't paying attention I'm sorry.
3174120	3180600	I want to get to where I'm like standing on the dome but I want to like jump up farther
3180600	3185440	to where I'm like kind of overlooking the dome from above yeah yeah what do I need to
3185440	3193020	roll for that dexterity for me that is a fail all right you are still stuck feet stuck on
3193020	3194020	this dome.
3194020	3200780	Okay I want to shoot another saw at him.
3200780	3207340	You know it works go ahead and roll firearms.
3207340	3210740	That's a crit success 22 on a 70.
3210740	3211740	Nice.
3211740	3216300	Okay you're like technically already dodging because you're rolling around so go ahead
3216300	3219620	and roll if you can critically succeed what was your crit success?
3219620	3220620	22.
3220620	3224940	And it's impossible for you to win but go ahead and roll anyway.
3224940	3228300	No okay I think you should roll.
3228300	3232020	I know I did roll.
3232020	3237960	Your no was a sign of failure not a refusal to roll I hear you loud and clear.
3237960	3240120	That is an 8 plus 3 that's 11.
3240120	3246840	Okay with a critical success yeah dude you're gonna roll that 8 again 11 plus 11 plus 3
3246840	3247840	so 14.
3248040	3254500	Right 14 total and describe what this buzz saw does to the as I shoot it it's kind of
3254500	3260200	where I'm positioned juggernaut is rolling coming at me so the force of the launcher
3260200	3266160	and the force of him coming at me meet and the saw goes inside of juggernaut.
3266160	3273760	Woo love it and that is with the death of osmahan wolf that is the end of round four.
3273760	3279160	Okay boy howdy with the end of round four we've seen a lot of interesting developments
3279160	3284780	here we have clark bishop he goes ahead and just jumps and makes a big ol punch with hulk
3284780	3289320	fists right down into planet juggernaut what do we think about that?
3289320	3298120	What do we think about that?
3298120	3303320	You know it seems to me he got his hand stuck in the worst cookie jar of all time.
3303320	3307760	Planet juggernaut's horrible metal body.
3307760	3314640	Who put their hands inside planet juggernaut clark puts his hands inside oh right no one
3314640	3319940	left so I'm moving on planet juggernaut guys it was good I was just imagining if like a
3319940	3325480	sportscaster actually did that fucking terrible it would be.
3325480	3330760	Planet juggernaut you know he took his time last round to really save up something special
3330760	3332040	for us this time.
3332040	3336860	Yeah he uh coiled up like a big murderous roly poly and delivered quite a blistering
3336860	3344440	attack rolling over clark bishop twice and completely obliterating osmahan wolf into
3344440	3350320	a pit of pit you don't like the inside of a nectarine that's basically what it looked
3350320	3356780	like out there with osmahan wolf he is round and wrinkly on the inside his organs are disgusting.
3356780	3360680	You know the crowd sure is getting aroused by the blood and I can't say that I'm not
3360680	3365480	feeling a little something too how about you mick I can smell the iron and wine in
3365480	3375160	the air baby and much like a shepherd dog keith vigno is a one trick pony once again
3375160	3382840	using the saw blade shooter at his vast disposal while stuck on the side of the dome shepherd
3382840	3389960	dogs can famously learn many tricks you know I have to wonder why is he not moving is he
3389960	3396300	too stupid or is he secretly a genius he seems to be landing the most hits at all these
3396300	3402280	chunks and avoiding the damage at the same time you know I have a fun fact about planet
3402280	3408640	juggernaut please tell us your fun fact about planet juggernaut nick mackles my fun fact
3408640	3412760	about planet juggernaut is that he keeps all the leftover teeth from all the matches and
3412760	3418880	sleeps on a big pile of them that's what I hear it's important to have a legend behind
3418880	3423560	any great villain at that moment you do see like a little hoover like coming out of the
3423560	3427920	body of planet juggernaut and like sucking out the teeth that are stuck to him from oz
3427920	3436760	mayhem just like plugging them out of the uh out of the goo and real quick let's head
