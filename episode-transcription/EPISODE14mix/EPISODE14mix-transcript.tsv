0	1600	Good morning, y'all.
1600	3480	How are y'all doing out there?
3480	6000	It is December 4th here in contention,
6000	8080	and it's been a jam-packed week here,
8080	10020	so I think it's good to remind y'all
10020	12360	what time it is every now and then.
12360	14760	Speaking of y'all, y'all done wrote me something
14760	17680	to read on the air again against my will.
17680	20520	Here is today's Howlin' with Wolf.
20520	21360	Up.
21360	22180	Ow!
23360	27120	Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
27120	27960	Ah.
27960	28800	Ah.
28800	29640	Ah.
29640	30460	Ah.
30460	31300	Ow.
31300	32120	Ow.
32120	32960	Ow.
32960	54220	Ow.
54520	56120	Are you provides?
56120	56940	Ha ha.
59460	61620	Tess said that all you wolf pups out there
61620	64620	would know what that means.
64620	67640	To some of our Canine listeners, y'all already
67640	71380	know the drill to all other species,
71380	74500	I apologize for that small outburst.
74500	77700	Thanks Tess, for making me lose my shit on air.
77700	81940	Now for some mole shit, it's the news.
81940	84180	Officer Bishop learned that the chief's car
84180	86820	had been at the mill on the other side of the city
86820	89740	since the night of December 1st.
89740	92860	The county coroner reports that during the investigation
92860	95360	of an active crime scene, Officer John Lee
95360	97980	Pettymore of contention slipped and shoved
97980	100060	a possible murder weapon into the eye
100060	102380	socket of the deceased Maggie Cook,
102380	104980	fumbling and digging around atrociously
104980	107400	as the charred bones themselves began
107400	111180	to crumble to no longer be a part of the situation.
111180	115020	Also, anyone out there having some fucked up dreams?
115020	117260	Shit, I know I have.
117260	120900	Last night, I was eating cereal in my basement,
120900	124660	but it wasn't like my basement, but it was.
124660	128900	When I looked down, my spoon was made of wet tuna
128900	132740	and the Count Chocula had turned into forgotten memories.
132740	137740	Then I saw my dog, Wolf, and he had my face on his face.
138740	140940	What the fuck is up with that shit?
141860	144300	Well, you know what they say.
147340	150100	Now I'm gonna need y'all to wave your hands in the air
150100	153420	like you just don't care, because in contention,
153420	157820	nihilism reigns supreme and the points don't matter.
157820	160060	It's kudzu with no backbone.
160060	160900	Ah!
167740	168580	Ah!
176580	177660	Hey guys, howdy.
177660	178500	Ah.
178500	180620	Oh, this is my new character voice.
180620	181900	John's phone rings.
182780	186780	Real quick, roll a constitution check for me.
189980	190920	Pass.
190920	191760	Pass.
191760	192580	Fail.
192580	196140	Okay, so John, you will get one hit point back
196140	201140	and the other two of you will get a D4.
201860	204080	I was gonna say two D6 would be great.
205580	207300	I rolled a three, I get three back.
207300	208480	Good work, Clark.
208480	210460	That brings me almost to perfect health.
210460	214220	One back, I still am 21 out of 25.
214220	216780	I've got 25 out of 26 hit points.
216780	218260	Well, you guys have insane.
218260	219100	What are you at?
219100	222860	I'm 18 of 20, but 20's my max.
222860	224620	My willpower is at two.
227140	230340	Which means I need a little help from my friend.
230340	231740	Your willpower is at two.
231740	234220	You guys put a lot into con.
234220	236820	I went middle of the road, baby, 50.
237940	241060	John, your phone rings as you're getting ready.
241060	242740	It's Keith Vigna.
242740	243660	I don't answer.
243660	244940	Okay.
244940	246320	I send John a text.
247540	251540	Hey dude, can you bring a little bit of stimulants for me?
251540	254740	I'm having a real off day today.
254780	257660	I text him, I have no idea what the fuck
257660	260280	you're talking about and I put the Shrug Guy emoji in there.
260280	263980	I put two snowflakes and a winky face emoji.
263980	266380	I send back all caps,
266380	269020	I don't know what you're talking about, angry face.
269020	271780	I send back, bring me something
271780	274660	where I will explicitly text it to you.
274660	275500	I don't reply.
275500	276700	God dammit.
276700	279140	Okay, I drive to John's house then.
279140	280700	Oh, oh god.
280700	282540	Damn, I'm already on the way to work.
283020	286340	I mean, you can resolve it if you want.
286340	287500	What's the timeline?
287500	289220	Does he come to my house or?
289220	291020	Keith, do you leave early enough to like?
291020	291860	Yeah, I do.
291860	293740	I get up and I put my clothes on
293740	296880	and I drive out there and I'm pissed.
296880	298060	I just woke up mad.
298060	300860	Okay, I'm gonna have you roll luck at a negative 20
300860	303140	to see if John is still there.
303140	303980	He's not.
305060	307240	I'm gonna break into his house though.
308240	309080	It.
312400	313680	I'm desperate.
313680	316780	So instead of getting some five hour energy.
316780	317620	That's not gonna.
317620	320200	You're gonna break into your coworker's house
320200	322200	and steal cocaine.
322200	324720	Yeah, because that's my only option right now.
324720	326200	He told me that that's.
326200	328400	I did not say that cocaine was your only option.
328400	331240	Yeah, but you said coffee wouldn't work, so I assumed.
334040	335760	Just jump all the way to cocaine.
335760	339240	It's literally like the most readily available option
339240	340180	we have here.
340180	342760	I thought this was gonna be a quick one and done.
342760	345640	That's why you're all in the room right now.
348480	351000	Okay, I get to his house and he's not there, I guess.
351000	351820	Yep.
351820	352660	Okay.
352660	354920	Definitely break in if you wanna like
356400	358040	really upset John later.
358040	359560	Yeah, I mean, I'm already upset.
359560	361200	So yeah, I'm fighting mad.
361200	362580	So I.
362580	365220	Because John, do you wanna describe your house?
365960	367320	It's the first time we've seen it.
367320	369960	Yeah, so it's a nice.
369960	371400	Poopy trap till I get it home alone.
371400	375280	I slip on some marbles and fall down the stairs.
375280	377120	It's a nice little property north of town.
377120	379600	You come down like a quarter mile
379600	381480	of secluded gravel driveway
381480	383840	and you come into this little clearing
383840	386460	and there's a nice fucking, you know, older
386460	389000	but single story smallish home.
389000	392280	There are some, like there's a random truck
392280	395440	and a trailer around, you know.
395960	400320	And it really looks just peaceful and beautiful
400320	403120	and there's like rabbits and deers jumping around and shit
403120	406840	and you're about to, you know, disturb that harmony, so.
406840	409560	So I pull up and I have lock picking
409560	411400	so I'm gonna try to do that first.
412440	413540	Is that cool?
413540	415180	At his front door?
415180	416020	Yes.
416020	416840	Okay.
417840	419840	With a minus 20, that's a pass.
419840	420680	Okay.
420680	423900	26 on a 30, which I have 50, so.
423900	425120	Sounds good.
425680	430680	And then like struggling, just like get out of your car,
431000	432880	get up there and start work.
432880	433720	Just sweating.
433720	435360	Yeah, just work your way into the house.
435360	439000	I go inside and I look around for wherever it would be.
439000	441180	Okay, roll a search for me.
444960	446280	It's a crit fail.
447720	450920	Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh.
450920	452640	John, what does he find?
452640	457640	He knocks over all my Smokey and the Bandit DVDs.
458040	459200	Ooh, doggy.
459200	462560	And almost tips over like the Dukes of Hazzard DVDs
462560	464220	right next to him.
464220	467460	Oh wait, hold up, Smokey and the Bandit is not a TV show,
467460	468300	it's a movie.
468300	470160	You had a bunch of copies of it.
470160	472560	Special edition.
472560	475380	Yeah, so every director's cut, yeah.
475380	477100	International releases.
478820	481440	And anything remotely related to the Smokeyverse.
481440	484920	Okay, well, I'm not leaving until I get what I need,
484920	488040	so I'll just go from room to room,
488040	491500	searching violently through everything till I find it.
491500	493660	Okay, is that how a crit fail search role works?
493660	495120	Yeah.
495120	498980	You violently turn over the house of John Lee Pettymore,
498980	501520	unable to find the cocaine that you know
501520	503700	is on the premises somewhere.
503700	506360	Wow, so this is what you want,
506360	508800	just our characters to get in an actual fight.
508800	513120	I mean, I'd be, I'm already pretty useless as a cop,
513120	516080	I literally could not do our job today without this.
519600	521520	So I don't find anything? Nope.
521520	522920	I text him one more time, I'm like,
522920	525280	dude, tell me where it is.
525280	528980	Tell you where what is, why, what are you talking about,
528980	531600	I've got, I brought some stuff for you,
531600	532800	it's at the station.
533640	535320	Oh, cool, thanks, see you there.
535320	540320	I try to put the DVDs back a little bit,
541320	543320	but then I just go, I give up and go to my car,
543320	544680	drive back to the station.
544680	545520	Okay.
546580	548920	I didn't want to do any of that.
548920	549920	You didn't?
549920	551680	No, but I had to.
551680	554200	I don't know if you know what those words mean.
555240	557680	All right, well, the three of you arrive
557680	559760	at the police station, rearing to go
559760	564760	on the morning of December 4th, you arrive at 9 a.m.
564760	567340	I sit at my desk and just put my head down.
568400	572360	Okay, you know that the FBI will be here in an hour
572360	576900	to meet with you, and as you are milling about the office,
576900	579480	as the day is beginning, you hear a news story
579480	583600	come over Drew's speakers at his desk,
583600	585640	and you hear the news story say,
585640	589280	10 people have died in a brutal fire at the city hospital.
589280	591640	46 more are in critical condition.
591640	593640	The fire started early this morning,
593640	595780	and the building has just now been cleared
595780	597880	after hours of fighting back the fire
597880	601900	and sweeping the premises for survivors after the evacuation.
601900	605040	We do not have any word yet on how the fire started,
605040	606520	but we will deliver updates
606520	608640	as they roll in here to the studio.
608640	610840	Hold your loved ones close today
610840	612520	as we send thoughts and prayers
612520	614640	to those who lost friends and family.
614640	616340	Stick around for our next segment,
616340	618900	experts say we're all showering too much.
618900	621560	With your morning update, I'm Yolanda Squat Pump.
621560	626560	And immediately following, Drew turns it down
626840	630120	to let you guys know that two children
630120	632840	were reported missing late last night
632840	634360	from a home in the suburbs.
634360	637480	Their names are Aiden and Alice Little.
637480	638760	Repeat those names, Drew.
638760	641680	Aiden and Alice Little.
641680	643620	Okay, we'll get right on that.
643620	646020	Okay, good, their parents are very worried.
646020	647640	I can only imagine.
647640	649740	I can only imagine.
649740	650920	Wait, where was that fire at?
650920	651940	I missed the first part.
651940	652960	The hospital.
652960	653800	Oh yeah.
653800	654620	The city hospital.
654620	656340	All right, what do you guys wanna do around the office?
656340	657180	I don't know.
657180	659040	I bet we have a lot of paperwork to do.
660020	660860	I bet you do.
660860	661700	Is there anything that you want to-
661700	663420	Good thing the chief's not here.
664640	666780	Is there anything you wanna take care of?
666780	668060	Oh, the chief's dead.
668060	668900	We should-
668900	669720	Yeah.
670720	672460	I didn't even, it's a new face.
674460	676460	Good thing the chief's not here.
676460	678140	Ugh, rip.
678140	678980	Hey, John.
679100	680940	Good thing the chief's not here.
680940	682180	John.
682180	683020	Yeah, Vigna.
683020	687080	Dude, can I, did you bring me any medicine?
687080	689020	Yeah, hey, you're smart enough to know
689020	692300	not to be texting about that shit on the open lines.
692300	693300	I just-
693300	695300	All right, I have some for you,
695300	697420	and I dangle a little baggy,
697420	700480	but I'm gonna need you to clean out
700480	701860	the cat man's cage first,
701860	706680	because he left a number of human-sized dudes in the corner,
706680	708140	and I'm not touching that.
708300	709140	Okay.
711580	712980	I'll get right on it.
712980	716500	Do you want a little bump first to help on these?
716500	717580	Okay.
717580	718700	I take a bump.
718700	720140	Roll a D6 for me.
721380	722200	Three.
722200	724100	All right, it is 9 a.m. currently,
724100	724940	and you are gonna-
724940	727300	So for the next 45 minutes, he'll have three.
729100	730440	For three hours, is that right?
730440	734100	For three hours, you will not be at a negative 20%.
734100	734940	Hell yeah.
734940	736860	Have the makers of this game ever done cocaine?
737740	738660	Yeah.
738660	740700	Yeah, you just roll a D6.
740700	742060	That's how it works.
742060	743580	Dictates the hype.
743580	747800	I happily go clean the shit out of the cell.
749860	751380	You missed a spot.
751380	752220	Is that true?
754100	757380	Dr. Jacobs says as you clean the cell
757380	759260	that she shares with her-
759260	763340	Hey, what charges are we holding her on again?
763340	764860	How long can we keep her here?
764860	766180	We looked it up at the time.
766340	768980	I think 24 hours, maybe 48.
768980	772820	It's because we wanted to investigate her.
772820	773660	Yeah, exactly.
773660	775340	And you know what, everything's in disarray.
775340	776740	Our chief is dead.
776740	777580	Oh, you know-
777580	778420	Our chief is dead.
778420	779240	And-
779240	780080	We got the FBI coming.
780080	780920	Is that what you're getting at
780920	782760	when they shouldn't have a Catboy in there?
782760	784780	No, if anything, I think that helps us.
784780	788180	That anything that can confuse and distract the FBI.
788180	790580	I'm just thinking further on down the road
790580	794500	when she brings a civil rights lawsuit against us.
794500	795340	Sure.
795340	797060	We'll call some imprisonment or whatever.
797060	799840	I think we're still within our rights for today.
799840	801500	Oh, that's what we'll tell the FBI.
802860	804520	Cool.
804520	807180	Before you ask, we're well within our rights today.
808340	809900	I cleaned the spot that I messed up
809900	813000	and I said, I would even eat off this floor,
813000	814120	but I'm not hungry.
815600	817220	Thanks for the input, Keith.
817220	818460	And then I come back up to John,
818460	819980	I'm like, can I please have that?
819980	821340	Yeah, I give him the baggie.
821340	824100	I stick it in my pocket and then I'm ready
824100	825180	to talk to these feds.
826140	829380	Fellas, we should maybe talk about our story here.
829380	832100	Do we want to tell them everything?
832100	832940	Tell them nothing?
832940	837060	No, I was thinking they're getting here in what, an hour?
837060	839340	I'll just roll out, I'll go get some,
839340	841300	you guys want me to pick you up some breakfast or something?
841300	842140	Have you guys eaten yet?
842140	843000	Oh yeah.
843000	845440	I go grab some food for us,
845440	848040	get back like right as they're getting here
848040	851540	and then act like, hey, I got our breakfast.
851540	853540	Also, anybody recognize this?
853540	854540	I don't know where it came from.
854580	856100	I found it in the trunk of my car.
856100	857060	That's the plan.
857060	857880	I like it.
857880	860060	And then I'll somehow remember that it's from John's house.
860060	862620	So when they were talking to me last night,
862620	864320	they seem to know a lot about a lot of stuff.
864320	866100	So if they start asking us about stuff,
866100	867620	are we gonna lie to them or?
867620	868540	I'm playing dumb.
869400	872120	I don't think we should let them know more than,
872120	874420	we're already giving them the one thing they wanted.
874420	875780	But what if they can help us?
875780	878180	Well, let's see how they, let's see how they,
878180	879020	let's read them.
879020	879860	Exactly.
879860	881300	Is that a skill?
881300	882540	Humant.
882540	884140	I got 80 humant, so.
885100	886800	And now I'm not at a negative 20.
886800	888100	So hell yeah.
888100	891260	Keith Vigna is fully aware of how much people despise him.
891260	892100	Yeah.
895540	897560	Also, John.
897560	898740	Yeah.
898740	902900	Later tonight, we'll have to have a personal talk.
902900	903740	What about?
903740	907740	In which I profusely apologize for what I did this morning.
907740	909540	Don't, we'll talk about it after the FBI.
909540	910420	I don't wanna worry you.
910420	913700	You don't have to apologize that much for those texts, man.
913740	914580	Okay, yeah.
914580	915420	Well, that makes me feel better.
915420	916580	I just wanted to.
916580	917420	Yeah, it's.
917420	918240	Yeah.
918240	919080	Okay, well.
919080	920140	Just try to maintain, you know,
920140	921940	discipline when texting about drugs.
921940	923940	Like, absolutely heard from now on.
923940	924980	Yeah.
924980	926920	What do you guys want for breakfast?
926920	929660	I want a supersonic breakfast burrito.
929660	931220	Okay.
931220	933020	Don't we, what's the local,
933020	934380	did we make a breakfast place?
934380	935420	Beans on Beans.
935420	937340	Yeah, let's go to Beans on Beans.
937340	938900	Because it's Bean Street, right?
938900	939900	Mm-hmm.
939900	942860	Yeah, I'm gonna head over to Beans on Beans.
942860	944800	Let me get that Big Bean special.
944800	946060	The Big Bean special?
946060	947940	You want the Big Bean Sonic burrito
947940	950260	that they import from the City Sonic?
950260	952740	I mean, Sonic's right around the corner.
952740	953940	If you could just stop at Sonic.
953940	954780	I'll swing by there.
954780	955600	That'd be great.
955600	956820	That'll kill me some time.
956820	958820	So you want the Big Bean breakfast?
958820	959660	Yeah.
959660	960980	Do you want, what kinda,
960980	962240	you want black or pinto?
964160	965000	Black eyed.
965000	965820	Black eyed?
965820	966660	Yeah.
966660	967500	Okay, extra bacon?
967500	968320	Extra bacon.
968320	969160	I know you.
969160	970900	One piece soggy and one piece crispy.
970900	971740	Okay, I can do that.
971740	972580	Just tell them it's Clark's.
972580	973400	Order them now.
973400	977460	Oh, the Beans, Bishop's Beans breakfast.
977460	978300	That's it.
978300	979120	Gotcha.
979120	979960	Bishop's Beans breakfast.
979960	980920	They told me they were gonna add it
980920	982180	to the menu at some point.
982180	983020	I think it might be.
983020	984580	I haven't been there in a minute, so I'll check it out.
984580	985420	Okay, cool.
985420	986980	Clark, frankly, I find it disgusting,
986980	990340	and I'm not in a habit to comment on a man's breakfast,
990340	993220	but I find it disgusting that you let them
993220	996060	dangle one strip of bacon in the bean water
996060	997060	and leave the other strip.
997060	998020	Have you tried it?
999000	999840	No.
999840	1000900	It's so good, buddy.
1000900	1001740	Haven't tried it.
1001740	1002740	All right, fuck it.
1002740	1003980	Screw it, make it two.
1003980	1005420	Two, okay, well.
1005420	1006840	I'll try it.
1006840	1009260	I'll be back in about,
1009260	1011060	let me know when they get here,
1011060	1011940	and then I'll be back then.
1011940	1013580	Just, they're getting here in an hour.
1013580	1015100	When you see their car pull in.
1015100	1016720	Heard, okay.
1016720	1021100	Keith, how do you feel about the street name Beans,
1021100	1022700	Beans on Beans?
1022700	1025460	I really try not to think about it too much.
1025460	1026900	You don't associate the two?
1026900	1029140	I do, but it makes me kinda sick of my stomach
1029140	1029960	the more I think about it,
1029960	1031680	so I don't wanna think about it.
1031680	1032520	Fair enough.
1032520	1033340	Why?
1035400	1039860	Keith's actual last name is Beans.
1039860	1044380	I forgot all about that, Beans.
1046040	1048320	I changed my name to avoid embarrassment
1048320	1050520	when I came back to town.
1050520	1052200	No offense to anyone named Vigna,
1052200	1054200	but kinda picked a dumb name.
1054200	1055960	I mean, Beans is a dumb name, but.
1055960	1057000	I think we're gonna.
1057000	1058200	Has that come out in character?
1058200	1060340	Well, I think you did mention something about.
1060340	1061840	Did you tell it to us, or just the?
1061840	1062680	I can't remember.
1062680	1063520	Yeah, it might have been out of character.
1063520	1065000	It was his dog.
1065000	1065840	His dog's name is Beans.
1065840	1066920	His dog's name is Bean.
1066920	1068300	Yeah.
1068300	1070300	That's weird if you're trying to escape it.
1070300	1071320	Yep.
1071320	1074640	I like to think that the dog has been around.
1074640	1076260	Before I was Keith Vigna.
1077360	1082360	Okay, so I go to my namesake street and breakfast joint.
1083480	1086200	It's technically your ancestor's namesake.
1086200	1090440	Okay, and the two of you are hanging around the office
1090440	1092020	waiting for the FBI.
1092020	1095400	Yeah, I actually, I need to talk to Drew for a minute.
1095400	1096240	Okay.
1104400	1106480	Hey, Drew, can I talk to you for a minute?
1106480	1107840	Yeah, sure.
1107840	1111440	Hey, so what time did Clark come by the station last night?
1111440	1113680	It was like 1 a.m.
1114680	1118840	That is about when we were meeting
1118840	1121400	with the people next door, right?
1121400	1122320	Yes.
1122320	1124320	Well, see, that's pretty strange, Drew,
1124320	1127120	because I was with Clark at 1 a.m.
1127120	1128760	Did you notice anything, besides the limp,
1128760	1130120	did you notice anything funny about him?
1130120	1132840	I mean, he looks kind of messed up,
1132840	1134800	like he'd been through some shit.
1134800	1137320	His uniform and everything seemed right.
1137320	1139120	Well, he wasn't wearing his uniform.
1139120	1142280	He had just come in earlier to change
1142400	1143800	into civilian clothes.
1143800	1146600	I guess he changed again into some other civilian clothes,
1146600	1149200	but yeah, no, he looked kind of messed up,
1149200	1151640	but he was wearing normal clothes.
1151640	1153840	And he warned you not to go to the Chief's house,
1153840	1156220	and this was before or after you were contacted
1156220	1157240	by the reporter?
1158320	1160000	This was before.
1161320	1162160	Jesus.
1163240	1165100	Okay, all right.
1165100	1166500	So from now on?
1166500	1167340	Yeah.
1167340	1170000	If you see one of us without any of the other of us,
1171000	1172240	that makes any sense?
1172240	1173520	Sure.
1173520	1175480	If I see any of you individually.
1175480	1176320	Yeah.
1176320	1179480	Just keep an eye out, because maybe it's not us.
1179480	1182640	What, what do you mean?
1182640	1184220	I don't rightly know,
1184220	1186980	but you know how we got that cat man in there?
1186980	1187820	Yeah.
1187820	1189660	Because he got Freaky Fried Ed with his cat?
1189660	1193400	Yeah, you guys keep saying that, but what do you mean?
1193400	1194560	What?
1194560	1196820	I mean, I get it that he wants to be a cat,
1196820	1198880	and he thinks he's a cat and stuff, but like-
1198920	1201400	Oh, shit, have we not put you in on this loop?
1201400	1203340	Maybe this is a bigger conversation.
1203340	1205000	Honestly, I'd like, yeah.
1206000	1207360	Once Clark gets out of the bathroom,
1207360	1208560	I think he should know about this too,
1208560	1210640	but I just wanted to go over it real quick.
1210640	1212400	Oh, yeah, well, while we're here,
1214280	1216880	you guys moved all the cocaine?
1216880	1217720	Oh, yeah.
1217720	1218980	Oh, shit, did we not tell?
1218980	1221760	Also, the FBI is gonna be here in about 20 minutes.
1221760	1222720	What?
1222720	1224640	Yeah, so we had to get the coke out of here.
1224640	1226240	Okay, yeah, good thinking.
1226240	1228440	It's all on my property.
1228920	1230360	Oh, that's amazing.
1230360	1232440	That's even better than it being here.
1232440	1235660	Yeah, oh, yeah, it's buried in a secure vault.
1236600	1237440	Perfect.
1238440	1239280	Okay.
1239280	1240920	Hey, that cake is safe, buddy.
1240920	1243920	Oh, yeah, it autocorrect messed up this morning.
1243920	1246880	Oh, I thought you were just being discreet, unlike Vigna.
1246880	1247700	What?
1247700	1249320	Oh, Vigna was texting me for some coke
1249320	1251200	because he knew it was at my house.
1251200	1253060	He's very tired and an idiot.
1254120	1256000	He is certainly that.
1256000	1257880	But hey, you know what, from now on,
1258160	1260920	why don't you call it cake or just anything besides coke
1260920	1261760	if we're texting?
1261760	1262600	I really like that.
1262600	1263880	We'll call it cake.
1263880	1267080	You know, I don't know how well that's gonna stand up
1267080	1268280	in a court of law, you know,
1268280	1269600	if they were viewing those texts.
1269600	1271100	Like, I think that's kind of one-to-one,
1271100	1273000	so we might wanna circle back and think of some.
1273000	1273920	But for right now...
1273920	1276600	If we're talking about kilograms of cake.
1276600	1278240	Yeah, that's gonna tip him off.
1279920	1280760	Man, this is a lot.
1280760	1283700	Honestly, I am in this.
1283700	1285700	I'm like, let's make some money,
1285740	1288460	but goddamn, this is a lot on top of all this
1288460	1292200	goo monster nonsense and the chief dyin'
1292200	1295840	and all the other things we haven't followed up on.
1295840	1296840	I'm gonna miss her.
1298220	1299800	Yeah.
1299800	1300860	Yeah, me too, buddy.
1308820	1310900	Clark comes back from the bathroom
1310900	1315060	and Drew and John Lee Pettymore are at Drew's desk talking.
1315900	1317500	Hey, Clark, could you come here a minute?
1317500	1318820	Yeah, what's up?
1318820	1321320	Hey, so I got a text from Drew this morning.
1322600	1326740	It seems while you and I were at the donut shop,
1326740	1330940	another you was at the station talking to Drew here.
1332300	1333520	What do you mean another me?
1333520	1334980	You heard that right.
1334980	1336300	Another you.
1338220	1340920	Like, somebody who said they were me?
1340920	1344380	No, so I saw you...
1345380	1349940	You came to the station last night at 1 a.m.
1349940	1354300	and you told me not to go to the chief's house.
1354300	1356120	And you were limpin'.
1356120	1359880	I'm really sorry that I went.
1360720	1363820	Now, I wish I would've listened to you,
1363820	1366060	but was that not you?
1366060	1368140	I mean, you must've been confused.
1368140	1371600	It was somebody that, it looked like me, maybe.
1373020	1374100	He said he was you.
1375100	1378380	Well, Drew, I was up at the donut the whole last night.
1378380	1380420	That was one o'clock, wasn't it, wasn't it, John?
1380420	1381260	Oh, yeah. We were there.
1381260	1383620	I was with, that's why I brought you in.
1383620	1384780	That's why I'm telling him, Drew,
1384780	1386260	because I was with the man.
1386260	1387580	So you must be mistaken.
1387580	1388500	It wasn't me.
1388500	1390980	Drew rolls a sanity test.
1390980	1391820	All right.
1391820	1393660	Nah, I don't...
1393660	1394500	Should we roll it?
1394500	1395860	Yeah, what's Drew's sanity?
1395860	1396820	He crit fails.
1396820	1399300	He's dead. Drew explodes.
1399300	1401380	Drew has a 100 power.
1401380	1402580	No.
1402580	1403900	I can see it.
1404540	1405700	It's like Kenneth from 30 Rock.
1405700	1406780	Yeah, exactly.
1406780	1408220	He rolls an i8.
1408220	1409060	Wow.
1409060	1410100	So he's sane as hell.
1410100	1411420	My boy's sane as hell.
1411420	1412260	Don't be telling him
1412260	1413940	that he's not seeing what he sees.
1413940	1414780	Clark.
1414780	1416100	Yeah, for the sake of the argument,
1416100	1417420	what else do I say?
1417420	1419500	You just came in, you were limping,
1419500	1422020	you were acting really weird, and you...
1422020	1422860	Acting weird how?
1422860	1424020	Was I mumbling?
1424020	1425140	Was I falling over?
1425140	1427940	You were kinda talking to yourself as you came in,
1427940	1430220	and you were wearing different clothes
1430220	1433460	than you were when you left with your CVs on,
1433460	1436380	and you were wearing normal clothes,
1436380	1437940	but you came in, you were limping,
1437940	1439340	you looked really haggard,
1439340	1441780	and you'd been through some stuff,
1441780	1445660	and you exasperatedly told me
1445660	1448020	not to go to the chief's house,
1448020	1450140	and I asked you why,
1450140	1452260	and then you were mumbling something,
1452260	1455300	and you walked away, and you just left.
1455300	1458780	And I was busy here, so I didn't worry about it.
1458780	1461020	I figured I wouldn't go to the chief's house.
1461100	1463620	I didn't understand why you didn't want me to go there,
1463620	1468500	but later when Mr. Dorsey came by,
1468500	1472180	when Harold stopped by and he wanted to go there,
1472180	1474460	he wasn't gonna take no for an answer,
1474460	1475620	and so I...
1478260	1480100	I went with him, I wanted to let him,
1480100	1482580	I didn't wanna just give him the chief's keys,
1482580	1483900	but he wasn't gonna leave,
1483900	1485740	and I was just trying to be nice.
1485740	1486660	Drew, you did good.
1486660	1488620	You did good there, don't worry about that.
1488620	1491180	Did you, I walked out the door,
1491180	1493740	but did you see if I got in a car and left, or?
1493740	1495060	I just stayed inside.
1495060	1496220	How about we check the tapes?
1496220	1498400	Can I see myself walking in, maybe?
1499300	1501620	That's a great idea. That's a great idea.
1501620	1503100	Forgot we had the...
1504340	1508460	Okay, so you guys go over to the security tapes,
1508460	1510860	and as you are watching them,
1510860	1514220	you see a figure limping,
1514220	1519220	wearing a hoodie and jeans,
1519260	1522380	limping their way into the police station
1522380	1524220	just from around the corner on foot,
1524220	1527460	then not even a minute later,
1527460	1531300	the same figure leaves around the same corner on foot.
1531300	1534380	We've probably got cameras inside the station, right?
1534380	1536660	Real world, probably, a police station would.
1536660	1538940	They would have cameras inside, yeah, sure.
1538940	1540840	Yeah, you got cameras inside.
1540840	1542700	Let's check that tape next.
1542700	1546340	Okay, so then you would see Clark Bishop
1546340	1550300	walk in to limp into the police station,
1550300	1552920	wearing the same clothes you saw the figure wearing outside,
1552920	1554860	say something to Drew,
1554860	1556580	Drew doesn't get up from his desk,
1556580	1558580	and then Clark leaves.
1558580	1561200	If you could both roll me a sanity check.
1563180	1564220	Fail.
1564220	1566840	I crit pass with an 11.
1566840	1568900	Okay, that is not you.
1568900	1569980	No way.
1569980	1572140	Not a chance that that's you.
1572580	1573420	Fail.
1573420	1575060	Would a crit pass?
1575060	1575900	I don't know.
1575900	1578860	Shouldn't he be like, that's me and I know it.
1578860	1580280	That's me and I know it.
1580280	1582240	That's an interesting perspective.
1582240	1583500	From my point of view,
1583500	1585920	the reason that I said there's no way that's used
1585920	1588080	normally when we do sanity loss,
1588080	1590340	the losing of a sanity.
1590340	1591820	Is from seeing the unnatural.
1591820	1593020	Yeah, so.
1593020	1594660	If I saw this and didn't lose sanity,
1594660	1596140	it probably didn't seem unnatural to me.
1596140	1597980	Exactly, yeah, if you lose no sanity,
1597980	1601760	you would deny its existence as being unnatural,
1602280	1604240	whereas you are wholly convinced
1604240	1607340	that that is Clark Bishop and you lose a D4 of sanity.
1607340	1608660	What do you think about, I mean.
1608660	1609920	That's in line with how we've been playing.
1609920	1611040	There was that guy who called me
1611040	1614100	and told me that the body was older on the inside
1614100	1615180	than it was on the outside,
1615180	1617440	and I crit passed a sanity check on that,
1617440	1620240	and so I just chalked it up to bad test results.
1620240	1621600	Yeah, that doesn't make sense.
1621600	1624280	It just seems like it's a little,
1624280	1628680	you wanna maintain your sanity for game reasons, right?
1628680	1629560	And then.
1629560	1631520	You wanna push the plot forward.
1632240	1635480	And understand more by passing rules,
1635480	1639140	but I actually like the discord between the two,
1639140	1644060	where not losing the sanity is good mechanically,
1644060	1646960	but not understanding the truth
1646960	1650720	is also technically good for your character,
1650720	1654920	even though we all know that learning more
1654920	1658200	about the unnatural causes the game to move forward.
1658200	1659040	Does that make sense?
1659040	1660440	But learning more about the unnatural
1660440	1663160	causes you to lose sanity, yeah.
1664040	1664880	One.
1664880	1666120	All right, so you only lose one?
1666120	1668640	You could also say, I know it's not me
1668640	1671440	in a more literal sense that I'm like so,
1671440	1673880	there's some tell that I'm so sure
1673880	1676320	that that's an imposter or something like that.
1676320	1677680	What do you think that would be?
1677680	1680720	I don't mumble, but I do mumble a lot.
1680720	1682480	You don't have a limp?
1682480	1683880	Yeah, right.
1683880	1685000	You don't own a hoodie?
1685000	1687920	Obviously it's not me, because I ain't limping.
1687920	1689720	Well, I think you're arguing past each other.
1689720	1691840	I'm not suggesting it is you, Clark,
1691840	1695320	but that's someone with your face.
1695320	1697720	Can I tell from the tape maybe what gave me my limp?
1697720	1699080	Are the pants ripped or any blood,
1699080	1700760	anything on them or anything?
1700760	1701600	Nope.
1701600	1702940	Maybe this is asking too much,
1702940	1706760	but given that this has been three or four days
1706760	1711600	of game time and this has been four months of game play,
1711600	1715020	have we in the past week encountered anybody limping
1716020	1717360	or heard about anybody?
1717360	1718200	Just Keith.
1720720	1722240	What the fuck?
1722240	1723080	Yeah.
1725800	1727680	John and Clark slowly look at each other,
1727680	1730780	realization passing between their eyes.
1730780	1731620	It's fucking Keith.
1731620	1732460	It's Keith.
1732460	1733280	He's a shapeshifter.
1734720	1737960	I'm a face taker.
1737960	1739400	Drew is looking at you.
1739400	1740860	Guys, I'm really scared.
1740860	1743960	I tell Drew, I put a hand on his shoulder
1743960	1747280	and I say, Drew, all I can tell you is that that wasn't me,
1747280	1748460	but maybe from here on out,
1748460	1751520	if you are talking to one of us, you might text us also.
1751520	1753440	I told him the same thing.
1753440	1755620	Yeah, that way we can be sure.
1755620	1758320	That way we'll know where you are?
1758320	1760960	Yeah, if it's not me, I'll text you back.
1760960	1762960	I'm not at the station, for example,
1762960	1765760	and then you should grab that person in front of you
1765760	1766720	and hold them.
1766720	1767560	Okay.
1767560	1770480	Unless somehow the imposter gets a hold
1770480	1774280	of one of our cell phones and knows about this arrangement
1774280	1776860	and then orchestrates a double switch.
1778040	1779000	That's unlikely.
1779000	1780960	Yeah, what if they get your cell phone?
1780960	1782880	No, it's the best plan we have,
1782880	1785440	but I'm just saying, be aware for anybody who comes up
1785440	1787000	asking to look at your phone or anything.
1787000	1788760	We can make a covert.
1788760	1791240	What if we handcuffed our phones to our hands?
1792120	1793320	No, that's stupid.
1793320	1794800	Drew, every time I see you,
1794800	1796940	I'm gonna say bubblegum tree.
1796940	1798840	Okay, yeah, I love that.
1798840	1801900	And I'm gonna say lollipop bush.
1801900	1804740	Okay, and I'm gonna say bubblegum bush.
1805620	1807700	Well, see, you should have your own thing.
1807700	1809400	You just kind of took our things.
1809400	1812420	Yeah, but I took the two that made it alliteration.
1812420	1813260	I like it.
1813260	1814800	Okay, hey, yeah, you do you, buddy.
1814800	1815640	What was it again?
1815640	1816860	Bubblegum bush.
1817900	1818720	I'm not gonna remember that.
1818720	1823380	And yours is lollipop bush and his is bubble tree.
1823380	1824200	Bubblegum tree?
1824200	1825300	We got it, we nailed it.
1825300	1826140	We definitely have this.
1826140	1827940	What if we all just say bubblegum tree?
1827940	1829300	Oh, that would make more sense.
1829300	1830140	Okay.
1830140	1831140	We all have the same word.
1831220	1832540	That sounds good.
1832540	1835180	Flash, thunder.
1835180	1837040	That's from D-Day.
1837040	1837880	Bubblegum tree.
1837880	1838980	Okay, so it's you.
1838980	1840020	Yeah, bubblegum tree.
1840020	1841060	Okay, so it's you.
1841060	1842300	Yeah, you got it.
1842300	1843120	Nailed it, buddy.
1843120	1843960	Bubblegum tree.
1843960	1844800	Hey, Drew.
1844800	1845620	Hey, Drew.
1845620	1846460	All right, cool, hey.
1848500	1849700	Okay, well.
1849700	1852100	Hey, do you mind texting the entirety
1852100	1853600	of that conversation to Clark?
1855920	1857240	Could you do that for us, buddy?
1857240	1858660	I mean, Keith, I'm sorry.
1858660	1859980	Oh, yeah, absolutely.
1859980	1860900	I'll let him know.
1861620	1863180	It's probably about time for us
1863180	1864380	to get him back here, right?
1864380	1866360	It's 11, 15, or what time is it?
1866360	1867200	It's like?
1867200	1868020	9, 15.
1868020	1868860	Did you mean Keith?
1868860	1869700	Yes.
1869700	1870520	Okay.
1870520	1871540	I thought you were saying Drew texts Clark
1871540	1873220	because we don't know if this Clark is the Clark.
1873220	1875060	I was also confused by that.
1876500	1880160	Oh, fuck, what if we just gave the password
1880160	1881060	to the fake Clark?
1882380	1885160	You're just gonna have to think that, I guess.
1886020	1887660	My eyes narrow and I just.
1887660	1890440	Hey, Drew, is there, can you think at any time
1890840	1892280	that maybe one of us came in here
1892280	1893200	and said something to you
1893200	1895280	and then never talked about it ever again?
1897120	1898560	Could this have happened before?
1898560	1902260	I mean, Clark, that happens literally all the time.
1902260	1903800	You guys talk about a lot of stuff
1903800	1906420	that you never follow up on again.
1906420	1907260	Fuck off, Drew.
1907260	1909640	There's only so many hours in a day, Drew.
1909640	1910480	God damn it.
1910480	1911840	Drew, I didn't ask your professional opinion
1911840	1913960	on our prowess in the copping world.
1913960	1914800	Did you get at the fucking,
1914800	1917720	God damn it, yeah, what are you, Detective Drew now?
1917720	1919560	You think you could do our job?
1919800	1921480	I hand Drew my gun and my badge
1921480	1924640	and I'm like, be me, motherfucker.
1924640	1926320	Walk a mile in these boots.
1926320	1928800	He gets a very serious look on his face
1928800	1931240	and he reaches out slowly for your gun.
1931240	1933200	I slapped his hand away.
1933200	1934780	God damn it, Drew.
1934780	1936760	Oh, okay, it was a joke.
1936760	1939800	I text both guys in a group message,
1939800	1941920	hey, it's cheaper to get this with an egg.
1941920	1943520	How do you want your egg cooked?
1946200	1947700	I text back, scrambled.
1947700	1950580	I didn't see the, I don't respond to the group text.
1950580	1952160	Okay.
1952160	1954180	I met beans on beans.
1954180	1957300	I ordered all three of the same thing with scrambled eggs
1957300	1959880	and I'm on my way back.
1959880	1964880	Oh, Joe is asking, did Clark recognize the clothing
1964880	1966060	that the other Clark was wearing?
1966060	1967540	Is it stuff that I knew that I owned?
1967540	1970420	It is not stuff that you own.
1970420	1971240	Okay, cool.
1971240	1973600	And that is one of the reasons
1973600	1975540	you found it hard to believe that that was you.
1975540	1977900	So I pull up to the police station
1977900	1979700	and I wait to see the FBI.
1979700	1984700	There is a large black SUV that pulls up next to you.
1985380	1987660	The windows are completely blacked out
1987660	1990720	and Agent Kennedy and Agent McKinley
1990720	1995720	make their way out of the shotgun and backseat of the SUV.
1996420	1997820	So they got a driver.
1997820	2001940	Or it's a self-driving Tesla FBI van.
2001940	2003400	Okay, I wait for them to go inside
2003400	2005520	and then I wait like 30 seconds
2005520	2008580	and I go around to the back of my trunk,
2008580	2012240	get that bag out and bring in my three bags of beans
2012240	2014820	and the black Nike bag.
2014820	2015820	Okay, sounds good.
2024240	2026100	Three, two.
2028040	2028880	Okay, so.
2028880	2030280	You didn't say one.
2030280	2031640	Son of a bitch.
2031640	2036000	So Clark and Drew and John are all standing around
2036000	2038700	Drew's desk right at the entrance of the police department
2038700	2042200	when Agent Kennedy and Agent McKinley walk in.
2042200	2044300	Clark, you are the only one out of the three of you
2044300	2045900	who has seen these two before.
2045900	2047040	So I'll describe them again.
2047040	2049640	Agent Kennedy is a short, young woman
2049640	2053080	and Agent McKinley is a tall, old, gruff man.
2053080	2057880	She has a bit of a spark in her step, glint in her eye
2057880	2061140	and he has very slow steps
2061580	2062740	and very dead eyes.
2062740	2066280	And they walk into the police department.
2066280	2069000	Agent Kennedy says,
2069000	2071860	well, hello there, Agent Kennedy FBI.
2071860	2072820	Good to see you both.
2072820	2073740	Hi, how are you?
2073740	2077240	And immediately upon looking at you guys,
2077240	2082220	Agent McKinley scans you and freaks out.
2082220	2085280	This is the tall, old, gruff man.
2085280	2088740	And his eyes get enormous
2088740	2090900	and he looks at Agent Kennedy
2091500	2092320	and he goes,
2092320	2096900	and then he sprints out.
2096900	2098580	He turns and he dips.
2098580	2100540	He runs straight out of the police department.
2100540	2103220	So Keith Vigna, you will actually see
2103220	2105500	as you're walking in with this stuff,
2105500	2107620	Agent McKinley running out,
2107620	2112620	going and gets back into the SUV
2113420	2114740	and slams the door shut.
2115600	2117920	When you say he scans us,
2117920	2120620	or would it take that he's some kind of robot?
2121200	2122040	No, I don't think so.
2122040	2123060	I just use that word.
2123900	2124740	So he's for sure a siren.
2124740	2125580	He's a robot.
2125580	2127020	He's a robot, 100%.
2127020	2128520	Cool, cool, robot.
2128520	2132060	It's an octo, octo, octo, octo?
2132060	2132900	Ocular.
2132900	2133720	Ocular.
2133720	2134560	Ocular pat down.
2134560	2135400	Ocular pat down.
2135400	2137240	I'm gonna get the word out sooner when it helps.
2137240	2138780	That was incredible.
2138780	2141420	Some kind of obstacle pat up.
2141420	2144980	Optic, but octo, octo, octo.
2144980	2146820	Optical.
2146820	2150140	So Agent Kennedy immediately starts apologizing
2150140	2152020	and she's like, oh yeah, no, oof,
2152020	2153900	I am so sorry about that.
2153900	2155880	I mean, he is just off his,
2155880	2158460	our last mission went very poorly
2158460	2161500	and he's just all over the place these days.
2161500	2163460	So did you?
2163460	2164280	Never mind him.
2164280	2166020	Where the hell are you from, lady?
2166020	2168920	Oh, I'm from Minnesota.
2168920	2170540	Minnesota, Ireland?
2170540	2172020	No, just Minnesota.
2172020	2175900	It's in the United States of America.
2175900	2180380	So you're from the Netherlands.
2180380	2181700	Is that what I'm getting?
2181700	2183100	No, it's in the US.
2183100	2185020	I am from up north.
2185020	2186240	This is how we sound up there.
2186240	2187560	I guess you haven't been.
2189500	2190500	I guess not.
2190500	2194200	So I walk in and I'm like, what's that dude's deal?
2194200	2197220	Oh, he's just had a real rough go of it the past few days.
2198420	2200180	Hey guys, I got your breakfast.
2200180	2201020	Oh, thank you.
2201020	2204140	I toss each of them the bag of breakfast.
2204140	2206980	Ms. Kennedy, this here's a, this is a officer.
2206980	2208300	Agent Kennedy.
2208300	2209900	Agent Kennedy, sorry about that.
2209900	2210720	Agent Kennedy.
2210720	2212580	This here's Keith Vigna.
2212580	2213700	He's an officer here with us.
2213700	2217160	Agent like Mr. Anderson.
2217160	2218580	I watched that movie the other day.
2218580	2220820	Keith, Keith, no, it's a, this is a,
2220820	2222100	This is a real live FBI agent.
2222100	2223180	It's a real agent.
2223180	2224860	Oh, you're real, you're real.
2224860	2226140	Yeah, she's not from The Matrix.
2226140	2227100	She's from.
2227100	2230220	Oh, oh yeah, you told me that she's gonna,
2230220	2231620	I forgot to get you breakfast.
2231620	2233500	Do you want some of mine?
2233780	2235180	No, I am good on the breakfast.
2235180	2237580	You don't like black eyed peas and bacon?
2237580	2239540	One soggy, one crispy.
2239540	2240380	That sounds.
2240380	2241220	Some scrambled eggs.
2241220	2243900	That just sounds deeply unappealing on all levels.
2243900	2245060	That's what I'm saying, lady.
2245060	2245880	Have you tried it though?
2245880	2246720	No one's.
2246720	2247560	No?
2247560	2248380	No one's tried it, Clark.
2248380	2249220	It's good.
2249220	2250860	Hey guys, also, I can't remember if one,
2250860	2253420	like if you guys, if this belonged to either of you guys,
2253420	2254940	I found it in the trunk of my car.
2254940	2257140	I was cleaning all the shit out of my trunk and.
2257140	2259580	Here, let me take a look at that there, Keith.
2259580	2262460	Well heck, this is a, this is a black Nike bag.
2262460	2263660	Isn't that what you were looking for?
2263660	2267180	I comically slap like hands on both cheeks
2267180	2271340	and I'm like, oh my God, what a coincidence.
2271340	2272700	What do you mean?
2272700	2274140	She is elated.
2274140	2277380	She is like clapping her hands together very quickly
2277380	2279220	and jumping up and down and.
2279220	2281300	We fooled her guys, we fooled her.
2281300	2283660	And she's like, oh my goodness,
2283660	2285840	I've been looking just all over for this.
2285840	2287780	Oh my, you have no idea.
2287780	2290520	I got bad news for you, Agent Kennedy.
2290520	2291360	It's empty.
2293180	2294180	Perfect.
2294180	2297340	And she will reach her arm out to grab it.
2301660	2304140	Hold on, hold on, just for the listeners.
2307020	2311660	Luke was nodding his head very intensely up and down
2311660	2314820	and Thomas was vehemently shaking his head no.
2317500	2319460	I hesitantly, go ahead and hand it to her.
2319460	2321020	Hold on, I put my hand out.
2321060	2323820	Hey now, what did you, what's this bag worth to you?
2323820	2324940	I go ahead and start pulling it back.
2324940	2329380	She stops clapping, stops jumping up and down
2329380	2332680	and gets a very serious look in her eye.
2334500	2336740	I don't think you'll want to be doing that.
2336740	2337940	That's all I need.
2337940	2340860	We just want a little information is all
2340860	2342220	we're really aiming for here.
2342220	2345620	A little quid pro quo between quid pro quo
2345620	2348000	between fellow officers of the law.
2348000	2350500	Okay, if you're looking for information,
2350500	2352060	how about this?
2352060	2357060	Let me use that bag and then I will give you information.
2357060	2358300	What are you going to do with that bag?
2358300	2360000	I just need to put something in it.
2360000	2362900	All right, this might sound like a strange question,
2364020	2367100	but it gets to the heart of what we're after here.
2367100	2369260	Do you want to put something strange in it?
2372180	2373060	Oh, sorry.
2373060	2374340	I'm pretty hungry.
2374340	2376400	I'm just going to go ahead and,
2376400	2378100	go ahead and start eating on this.
2378100	2383100	I sit down at my desk and start eating my beans
2386060	2387580	while I watch this unfold.
2387580	2390660	I suppose yes, officer petty more.
2390660	2393540	It would be something quite strange.
2393540	2395060	What sort of strange.
2395060	2398560	She reaches into her back pocket and pulls out
2398560	2403560	a small lock box that is two inches by two inches
2404460	2406980	and it has a combination lock on it.
2406980	2409860	And she starts messing with the numbers.
2409860	2414020	Now I'm not going to open this until I can drop
2414020	2416300	what's in here directly into that bag.
2416300	2419940	All right, can you open it up for me officer Bishop?
2419940	2423420	Sure, I go and I reach out and I hold it open underneath.
2423420	2426900	She clicks the numbers into position
2426900	2430740	and then holds this lock box right above the bag.
2431620	2436620	And then she opens it and there inside is
2437260	2442260	a small metal sphere about an inch in diameter
2443340	2445540	and she immediately just tilts it
2445540	2450420	and it drops right into the black Nike bag.
2450420	2454140	And she closes up her packet and puts it in her back pocket
2454140	2457500	and breathes the deepest sigh of relief
2457500	2460320	you've seen someone breathe in some time.
2462760	2464660	With the bag still being held open by me,
2464660	2466500	I pull up to where I can see into it.
2466900	2468180	Do I see the ball at the bottom of the bag?
2468180	2469020	No.
2469020	2469940	That's a heck of a trick lady.
2469940	2470780	Thank you.
2470780	2474460	Now I appreciate you finding that for us
2474460	2476220	but I'm going to have to take it
2476220	2478860	and we're going to leave you to it here.
2478860	2483680	Real quick, that little ball, what was that?
2485920	2490920	That was why Agent McKinley is so unintelligible these days.
2491280	2494600	That little ball caused us so much trouble.
2494600	2497680	Huh, I'm good to finally be rid of it.
2497680	2499800	What kind of trouble did it cause you?
2499800	2503280	Officer Bishop, we can't really get into that.
2503280	2507280	You see, we have you a bit over the barrel here
2507280	2511320	with all the goings on and I happen to hear
2511320	2514080	that your chief's home blew up last night.
2514080	2516760	Now, we're not sure what kind of a situation
2516760	2518760	that that puts you in here but I'm not sure
2518760	2521000	of a situation that that puts you in here
2521000	2525920	but with all the strange happenings here in contention,
2525920	2528160	I would think that you have far more important things
2528160	2529280	to be worrying about.
2529280	2531440	I think actually, you're right
2531440	2536100	and we're in agreement there but where we might not see
2536100	2538380	eye to eye is that I'm not so sure
2538380	2540300	this ain't both of our problems.
2541300	2543320	Eye with a mouth full of beans, I've.
2543320	2547160	What, what was that, Keith?
2548040	2549520	Get over here, I gotta ask you something.
2549520	2551740	Oh, all right, I'll hook over.
2553000	2558000	Should I tell her about that silver ball that we found?
2558400	2560600	I was just gonna see if we could keep the bag
2560600	2561480	in case we need it.
2561480	2564480	Yeah, okay, I was gonna say something
2564480	2566640	but I thought you guys might get mad if I did
2566640	2567840	so I'm not going to.
2567840	2569440	That was a good instinct.
2569440	2571600	I was more than the bag.
2571600	2574920	I was gonna see if we could keep this FBI agent
2574920	2577080	in case we need it, you know what I mean?
2577840	2579840	Get her to help us out.
2579840	2582520	She seems to know about strange shit.
2582520	2585480	What are y'all talking about over there?
2585480	2587720	You're the next part of my plan.
2587720	2589280	Holler, just keep your voice down.
2589280	2590600	You're not needed yet.
2590600	2592040	Just shut up in there.
2592040	2595520	Stop your husband from pissing so much if you wanna.
2595520	2596360	It's her cat.
2598200	2600780	That's, it's like we said, it's confusing
2600780	2602200	as to what that is.
2602200	2604200	That's her husband's body, pissing like a cat
2604200	2606140	all over our goddamn prison walls.
2606140	2609540	But if it was her husband, it wouldn't be him pissing.
2609540	2610980	He wouldn't piss in there.
2610980	2613580	The cat is what pissed in the cell.
2613580	2614940	I got you, I understand.
2614940	2615780	I know what you meant.
2615780	2617500	I was just making sure we remembered what happened.
2617500	2619180	Yeah, yeah.
2619180	2620020	It's thorny.
2621220	2622700	Signing blame in this scenario.
2622700	2626500	Hey, anyway, Agent, are you staying in contention
2626500	2627340	for a while?
2627340	2630340	We could show you around the night life.
2630340	2632020	What she just told us is that she's not.
2632020	2632860	So we gotta work through it.
2632860	2634860	Oh, see, I was too busy thinking about
2634860	2635700	balls and beans. You got a mouth?
2636260	2637600	You got a mouth full of beans.
2639300	2641340	Just balls and beans.
2641340	2643140	It's all it ever is with you, Keith.
2644600	2646860	Why don't we, we should call you beans.
2646860	2648100	No, we shouldn't.
2648100	2649940	Keith beans is what we should call you.
2649940	2650780	No, don't call me that.
2650780	2651620	He does love him so much.
2651620	2652440	Don't call me that.
2652440	2654020	You love beans so much, we're gonna call you
2654020	2655940	Keith beans. Let's talk about something else.
2655940	2656940	Okay, beans.
2658280	2662700	Hey, Agent, FBI person.
2662700	2663540	My Lord.
2664100	2664940	My Lord.
2668020	2669060	Yeah, hey, you.
2669060	2672680	Yeah, come over, take a look at our cell real quick.
2672680	2675660	She begins walking over where you are.
2675660	2679020	So I was imagining Keith's desk is way back
2679020	2679860	in the bullpen.
2679860	2681440	You guys definitely stuck him in the back
2681440	2682660	of the department.
2682660	2686300	And so he is the closest one back to the cells.
2686300	2689420	So she begins walking across the station
2689420	2691120	and makes it to where you guys are
2691120	2693380	and peeks her head in and looks at the cells.
2694080	2696020	Hey, you see that man pissing in the corner like a cat?
2696020	2701020	She looks over and she sees the body of Doug Jacobs
2701740	2706580	on all fours, but with one paw just like up on the wall
2706580	2711580	of the cell and he is pissing kind of back behind him
2713500	2718500	and then he starts to kick up his feet onto the like nothing
2719020	2723740	to cover the urine that is on the cell floor.
2723740	2725500	Hey, hey, Dr. Jacobs.
2725500	2726380	Yes?
2726380	2729660	Could you tell our guest here exactly what happened
2729660	2731220	to your husband?
2731220	2733940	My husband believes he is a cat.
2733940	2735940	What the fuck, lady?
2735940	2739020	All right, no, your husband was turned into a cat by radio.
2739020	2744020	Ma'am, these men keep telling me these crazy stories
2744420	2747660	and they've locked me up in here with no proof
2747700	2748940	that I belong.
2748940	2751940	They did not read me my Miranda rights properly
2751940	2753300	when I was arrested.
2754820	2758200	Yeah, you got no proof of that and we did, by the way.
2759420	2762100	I'm almost positive we always do that.
2762100	2764060	We do that every time.
2764060	2766700	So just don't stop your hearsay.
2766700	2769860	Are you a federal agent of the law?
2769860	2773660	And Agent Kennedy is just kind of staring
2773660	2775220	at this whole situation.
2775220	2776540	She looks at you guys.
2777740	2779980	All right, she's being uncooperative.
2779980	2781660	Obviously anybody would be pissed off
2781660	2784100	about being stuck in a jail cell with their cat husband
2784100	2786860	for however long we've kept her in there.
2786860	2791860	But hey, that is a cat man and a radio did it to him.
2792580	2794500	A weird radio and there's a weird gun
2794500	2796120	and there's a weird camera
2796120	2799220	and there's all this oil all over the place
2799220	2802800	and this shit is frankly scaring the hell out of me
2802800	2805740	and I don't know what's going on and I need you to help.
2805740	2808880	I'm standing next to John and hearing him say it all,
2808880	2810900	like that is kind of a relief for me
2810900	2813520	and I'm kind of like nodding earnestly.
2813520	2817620	And that is a fucking cat man and what do we do?
2817620	2820420	Agent Kennedy looks at you all
2820420	2825420	with a deep knowing sadness in her eyes
2827680	2829000	and she says,
2829920	2834920	Well, I guess that means that
2836740	2838260	you guys are in.
2841840	2843020	I'll be right back.
2843920	2848920	And she walks out the door of the police station
2850520	2855040	and walking back in is Agent Kennedy
2855040	2860040	along with a young bald fit man with sunken intense eyes
2861820	2864680	wearing a black t-shirt and jeans
2864680	2868700	and you would all recognize him as Billy Harrison,
2868700	2870680	the man that was tied up in the back
2870680	2873300	of Charles Donovan's car.
2873300	2876560	Oh shit, Keith, it's that guy who made a fool of you.
2876560	2878480	I don't think I rush him,
2878480	2880940	but I am like hand toward the gun.
2880940	2882220	That's a wanted fugitive.
2882220	2883060	Yeah, same.
2883060	2884680	Hey, hey, you stop right there.
2884680	2889680	So as he walks in, he is carrying Keith's uniform
2890640	2894920	pressed and folded in a pile in one of his hands
2894920	2898980	with Keith's service revolver sitting on top of it.
2898980	2901400	I look down at my uniform that I have on
2901400	2903240	and there's black beans just spilled,
2903240	2905560	or black eyed peas just spilled all over it
2905560	2907840	and I'm like, okay, I could use that.
2908760	2911720	I get up and I stink eye him and I walk up
2911720	2914120	and I grab my clothes out of his hand
2914120	2917420	and I am red faced with embarrassment and anger
2917420	2919480	and I walk back to my desk.
2921060	2926060	As you walk away from him, he says to you,
2926820	2929420	I sure hope that you're feeling better.
2929420	2931420	Yeah, I mean, no thanks to you.
2931420	2932260	I did everything.
2932260	2933700	What the hell was that?
2933700	2938700	I did everything that you asked me to do, Officer Vigna.
2940100	2942260	Keith, what the hell did you ask him to do?
2944740	2946900	I just didn't ask him to attack me.
2947740	2948740	That's what he did.
2949780	2952900	John and Clark's heads are turning back and forth
2952900	2954260	between each person.
2954260	2955340	Yeah.
2955340	2957620	This man looks incredulous
2957620	2961580	and he looks over at Agent Kennedy.
2961580	2965780	He's like, I don't know what you're talking about,
2965780	2969820	Officer Vigna, if you wanna keep what happened
2969820	2972880	between you and I private, that's one thing,
2972880	2974980	but don't go spreading rumors about me.
2975980	2978500	Keith, Keith, what happened in that hospital?
2978500	2980740	I told you what happened already.
2980740	2981980	He told us.
2981980	2984180	Hey, he may look as dumb as he is,
2984180	2986640	but he's our friend, kinda, so.
2986640	2990420	Well, your friend made me at gunpoint
2990420	2992540	change into his clothes
2992540	2995800	and then handcuff him to a hospital bed
2995800	2998040	and then prance around the room
2999180	3001740	yelling about some Keith beans
3001740	3005260	and he wanted me to smack him in the face repeatedly,
3005260	3007340	but very lightly.
3007340	3012020	It was deeply uncomfortable for me and I.
3012020	3013500	Stop, just stop right there.
3013500	3015620	I don't know what the hell you're talking about or how.
3015620	3018700	No, no, that all scans.
3018700	3022500	If it's some Dom sub thing that you're into, that's fine,
3022500	3026460	but I didn't like being dragged into it personally.
3026460	3027300	Yeah, Keith, you gotta keep that.
3027300	3028940	I don't know who the hell you think you are, but.
3028940	3029780	Hey, buddy, that is,
3029780	3031740	you gotta keep that person alive personally,
3031740	3033100	you know, not on the job.
3033100	3034060	I just. Let you free.
3034060	3034900	Hey, you know.
3034900	3037460	I just go sit down and eat the rest of my beans,
3037460	3038780	fuming, angry.
3038780	3040340	That's why we call them beans.
3041620	3046620	Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.
3048620	3050860	Hey, okay, so who the hell are you people?
3050860	3051900	What's going on here?
3051900	3053960	Yeah, what'd you mean by we're in?
3053960	3054800	I knew it.
3054800	3056540	You're a goddamn X-man.
3056540	3059540	Agent Kennedy looks at Billy Harrison and says,
3060540	3063580	they've seen a lot of shit,
3063580	3067540	so I say we just let him keep the bag,
3067540	3069180	give him the number and bail.
3069180	3070300	You wanna get home, right?
3070300	3072820	And he's like, I need to get home.
3072820	3074420	Does she noticeably lose that accent?
3074420	3076180	Oh yeah, it's gone.
3076180	3077540	Okay.
3077540	3080060	I pull my gun out and point it at Billy Harrison and say,
3080060	3082260	if you leave right now without telling us what's happened,
3082260	3083300	I will kill you.
3083300	3085540	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
3085540	3088100	Keith, Keith, Keith, that conversation we had about guns.
3088100	3089040	I don't care right now.
3089080	3091640	He is, I don't know who this guy is, but I don't like him.
3091640	3092480	Hey, hey, Keith.
3092480	3093960	All right, keep your gun on him,
3093960	3095540	but also come over here for a second.
3095540	3097840	I stand exactly where I am, I'm fighting Matt,
3097840	3098960	I'm furious, looking right at him.
3098960	3100120	I'm gonna come over there.
3100120	3101560	I'm gonna whisper here, okay?
3101560	3102400	Okay.
3102400	3103640	All right, hey, guess what?
3103640	3106680	Like I won't tell Clark, but it is what he's saying, Drew.
3106680	3107520	No.
3107520	3108340	Are you sure?
3108340	3109180	I swear to God.
3109180	3110020	Are you sure, buddy?
3110020	3110860	That's why I wanna shoot him.
3110860	3111680	I wanna shoot him right now.
3111680	3114040	Okay, well think about if maybe you haven't done
3114040	3115760	anything today that somebody wouldn't get
3115760	3117160	shooting Matt at you for,
3117160	3120440	and if anybody needs to die, you know what I mean?
3120440	3122520	While you guys are having this conversation,
3122520	3124600	he speaks up and he says,
3124600	3129600	and I would like my gun and my ID back, please.
3129760	3131520	We do, I think we have those, right?
3131520	3132620	Yeah, go ahead and go.
3132620	3133460	Pick it out and evidence.
3133460	3134880	Go get it out of the evidence bags, yeah.
3134880	3136600	Don't give him his gun back again.
3137880	3141200	So when you, Clark, when you walk back into the room,
3141200	3145740	Keith has his gun trained on Billy Harrison,
3145740	3150740	and John is whispering sweet nothings into Keith's ear,
3150820	3153460	and Billy is just standing there looking at you
3153460	3154820	as is Agent Kennedy.
3154820	3158300	I'm gonna kinda edge my way if I can in front of that gun.
3158300	3163140	I do the, I put my hand way over and aim it over him.
3163140	3167900	I'm doing exaggerated fake yawn, and put my hand up.
3167900	3170040	You can't, don't leave here without,
3170040	3171220	I don't know who you are,
3171220	3173900	how you know what you know about me or us,
3173900	3176820	but just tell us something before you go.
3176820	3180660	I take, I'm taking the badge and I have his gun, right?
3180660	3182540	You have, yeah, his ID and his gun.
3182540	3183380	I'm gonna just.
3183380	3186180	Well, wait, Clark, before you give him that gun,
3186180	3187460	let's have a little pow wow.
3187460	3189740	No, I still, I go walk up to him,
3189740	3192520	and I have the clip out of the gun,
3192520	3196220	and I hand him the ID and just the clip,
3196220	3198260	and I'm holding onto the gun, and I'm saying,
3198260	3199500	I'm not gonna let him shoot you,
3199500	3202860	but the sentiment does ring true.
3202860	3204860	We wanna know what's going on around here.
3206060	3211060	Okay, well, what is going on around here?
3211580	3214580	She kicks in and she's like, you're fucked.
3216260	3218660	Each and every one of you are completely fucked.
3219700	3222240	Guys, the world does not work in the way
3222240	3225540	that we all grew up knowing it to be,
3225540	3230540	and you are now charged with understanding that.
3231140	3235860	That understanding of the world will cause your life
3235860	3237980	to crumble before your eyes,
3237980	3242260	but the thing that keeps us going is that daily,
3242260	3245520	we are saving the human race
3245520	3248200	from getting wiped out of existence.
3249340	3253180	We're going to give you the same information newcomers get,
3253180	3257260	which is a phone number, and he reaches in his pocket,
3257260	3260340	and he pulls out a card, and it's got a phone number on it,
3260980	3263220	and she says, now you give them a call
3263220	3266220	if things get completely out of hand,
3266220	3268900	or they will call in 48 hours if you don't.
3268900	3273900	I hate to do it like this, but this is your problem now.
3273980	3275940	I'm gonna leave this bag here with you.
3275940	3280260	Anything you put in it disappears.
3281980	3284860	This bag, we do not know what it does
3284860	3287720	or what it is capable of outside of that,
3287720	3291120	but we do know that it seems to make things
3291120	3295940	that we need to not be on this world anymore.
3295940	3297740	It makes them gone.
3297740	3300600	Very few have heard of it, even fewer believe it,
3300600	3303840	but we've all seen today, all of us for the first time,
3303840	3307800	that Agent Victor's Nike bag is legit.
3307800	3309460	I'm going to leave it with you all,
3309460	3311400	and you can drop it at a secure location
3311400	3314300	when the job is done, and he says,
3314300	3316880	and I'd like my gun back, please.
3318200	3320080	I turn and look back at Keith.
3320080	3321480	The whole time she was talking,
3321480	3325440	I was just slowly lowering my gun and jaw dropping.
3325440	3328220	I'm kind of slowly realizing what's been going on
3328220	3329800	the past few days and putting it together,
3329800	3333720	and gun is holstered, and I'm kind of just staring off.
3333720	3336840	I turn back and go ahead and hand him his gun.
3336840	3339160	Good luck, and they walk out.
3342160	3344120	Guys, we're fucking X-Files now.
3344120	3349120	["How Am I the Only One Trying to Pull Over"]
3360400	3365400	How am I the only one trying to pull over?
3368040	3373040	How can you have enough drowning out
3374320	3378920	of the noise?
3378920	3383000	There's no one more home.
3383000	3387600	No one more home.
3387600	3391000	No one more home.
3391000	3394080	Fly, fly, to the stream.
