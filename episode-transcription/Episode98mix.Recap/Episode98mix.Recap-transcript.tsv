0	3740	Beep bop, beep boop, beep bop boop.
3740	7100	It's Wolf the Robot here to give y'all the scoop.
7100	12100	PTBP 694.2, y'all know the drill
12580	15780	and y'all definitely know what time it is.
15780	19420	But wait, do y'all actually know what time it is?
19420	23300	Cause I have never once looked at a clock.
23300	25820	I hope we broadcast at a decent time
25820	29180	where people can tune in in mass droves.
29200	33400	Today's Howlin' with Wolf comes from at SexyBaconStrip,
33400	37140	who tweeted about the show and tagged at PretendingPod,
37140	40620	a delicious, smoky, and salty thing to do
40620	42700	if I do say so myself.
42700	43620	They right.
43620	45640	Howdy, Wolf, just a heads up.
45640	47220	Ever since all that weird stuff
47220	48780	started here in contention,
48780	52260	the dumpster behind Al's Tires and Tiger Sanctuary
52260	56600	has turned into some Grade A quality eats.
56600	59960	Much like this podcast, it's got all the goo and slime
59960	62200	in all the right places.
62200	64120	Really though, this podcast has become
64120	66460	one of the main things I look forward to.
66460	69680	It's so great I even got my own slip case for Delta Green
69680	72380	and I can't wait to put my players through hell.
72380	75360	Thank y'all and fuck Jeff Bezos.
75360	77960	Thank you for writing SexyBaconStrip.
77960	79800	I ain't never met a bacon strip
79800	82720	that I didn't find at least somewhat erotic.
82720	85600	I appreciate you saying those positive things,
85600	87860	but the way that none of those positive things
87860	89840	were directed at y'alls truly
89840	92880	specifically has me feeling some kind of way.
92880	95800	Time to hit up Al's Tires and Tiger Sanctuary
95800	97720	for some delicious rubber
97720	100920	and possibly endangered mystery meat.
100920	104680	Remember to tag us in some nice things on the social things
104680	107800	if you want us to probably read a thing that you said.
107800	110100	Spread the love, spread the goo,
110100	113020	and remember to spread the word of wolf too.
113020	115580	Now prepare a warm spot on the floor
115580	119460	to vore even more of this hardcore lore with Gorgolore
119460	121700	and I'll roar and roar for an encore
121700	124140	from the troubadours that I adore.
124140	126140	It's kudzu with no backbone.
156140	158860	In a high school classroom,
158860	162140	the analog clock on the wall said 3.30
162140	165140	and the chalkboard said detention.
165140	167820	Sat at the only occupied desk in the room
167820	170020	was a boy of 13 or 14.
170020	174100	Jeremy Pettymore wore a denim cutoff jacket,
174100	177660	a raggedy thin Western shirt, wrangler jeans,
177660	181700	some punky boots, and a perpetual scowl.
181700	182940	There was a knock on the door
182940	186700	and two more boys of a similar age entered the room.
186700	189100	The first was Ken Krenkelhoff,
189100	192680	wearing a letterman jacket bought for him by his dad.
192680	195180	Ken was tall, fit, had great hair,
195180	198280	and walked with his head held high.
198280	200120	The teacher greeted Ken warmly,
200120	203660	then happily acknowledged the second boy, Ash Hornbeam,
203660	206520	with his black, messy hair, white t-shirt,
206520	209260	cheetah print vest, acid-washed jeans,
209260	211280	and scuffed tennis shoes.
211280	213240	The teacher administering detention
213240	216760	was confident the new arrivals didn't belong,
216760	217920	but Ken said they wanted
217920	219960	to keep their friend Jeremy company.
219960	221320	The teacher was reluctant, but said,
221320	224180	"'These two boys are allowed to do whatever they want.'"
224180	227240	Jeremy said his schoolwork necessitated his friends,
227240	230240	so if he was supposed to get anything done,
230240	231680	he had to go with them.
231680	234600	The teacher was relieved to have an excuse to end detention,
234600	237160	and Jeremy flipped him off on the way out.
237160	238880	The young Pettymore asked the other two
238920	241320	if they were ready for the woods that night,
241320	243440	and Ash opened his jacket
243440	246400	and revealed a bunch of water dynamite.
246400	248920	Ken seemed a bit reluctant, but agreed to go,
248920	252200	since this year was their last hurrah.
252200	254320	Ken would have to meet them in the woods, though,
254320	257940	since his mom would still wanna drive him there herself.
257940	259340	As they walked through the hall,
259340	262080	an upperclassman asked them what they were up to that night.
262080	263740	Jeremy said they were going to the woods,
263740	264580	that's their thing.
264580	266080	Once a year, they go into the woods
266080	270640	to look for some folktale legend called Ol' Madge.
270640	272520	They left Silas Cole K through 12,
272520	275200	slapping the banner sporting their mascot,
275200	277060	a minor, on the way out.
279900	282560	That evening, Ash drove Jeremy to the woods
282560	284020	in his older brother's car.
284020	288720	A 1991 Firebird painted a weird, ugly gold.
288720	290560	They turned onto a dirt road,
290560	293160	and a squirrel ran into the path of the car.
293160	296320	Ash was able to quickly swerve and miss it.
296320	298140	They pulled into the gravel parking lot
298140	300000	for the contention woods,
300000	302300	and there were two cars in the lot already.
302300	304680	One had a boot on the back left wheel,
304680	307840	and the other had a notice taped on the driver's side window
307840	310840	that threatened to boot if it wasn't moved.
310840	313720	There was also a Ford Bronco with a lift kit on it
313720	316840	over next to the small, usually unoccupied,
316840	320480	park ranger shack at the entrance to the woods.
320480	322780	Ash left a note under his windshield wiper
323260	326860	that said, please don't boot my car, signed Ash Hornbeam.
326860	329260	They checked if the two cars were unlocked, both were.
329260	331380	In the first car, there was almost nothing,
331380	333820	as if it had already been cleaned out.
333820	336580	In the second car, there was a bunch of camping equipment
336580	338060	and a title for the vehicle,
338060	341420	which listed a Stuart Feldman as its owner,
341420	343580	registered in the city.
343580	345820	Jeremy found some liquor and a pistol.
345820	347660	Ash grabbed some of the camping equipment
347660	351540	and headed over to the shack where he saw an elderly man
351540	354580	wearing a state issued uniform sitting on a stool,
354580	356860	just waking up as Ash approached.
356860	360060	The boys realized this wasn't the normal forest ranger
360060	363060	of contention, he introduced himself as Woodrow
363060	364980	or Buzz for short.
364980	368060	In addition to the normal ranger paraphernalia,
368060	371520	there was a big thing, a hand sanitizer and a board
371520	373460	behind Buzz covered in pictures
373460	375900	and pieces of paper thumbtack to it.
375900	378720	Buzz took out a Polaroid camera, took their pictures,
378760	381720	took down their information, citing a recent string
381720	384440	of disappearances in the woods as his reason
384440	388320	and placed the pictures and information up onto the board.
388320	390920	Ash asked if they could borrow the first aid kit
390920	392720	and Buzz gave it to them.
392720	395920	Ash shot an M80 into the distance with his slingshot
395920	397840	and Buzz about shat his pants.
397840	400600	So he went to the bathroom and Jeremy seized the opportunity
400600	403520	to grab a fire extinguisher, two machetes,
403520	406160	three flashlights and hand sanitizer
406160	408960	and they shoved it all into their bags.
408960	410920	They looked over the missing persons board,
410920	412840	there were 18 missing people,
412840	415280	several of whom the boys recognized.
415280	417280	They saw Stuart Feldman on the board,
417280	420560	he was an older bald British man in incredible shape
420560	422440	with a thick jawline.
422440	426020	He had claimed to be in the woods on business.
426020	428680	Jeremy also saw the keys to both the Bronco
428680	431260	and the shack itself and snagged them.
431260	434200	Buzz returned and the boys asked if they could take a picture
434200	436080	of the missing persons board so they could have
436960	439560	a reference if they ran into any of the people in the woods.
439560	441880	Buzz agreed and gave them a Polaroid picture
441880	444480	of the board of Polaroid pictures, woof.
444480	447280	The two boys gathered their things and headed off
447280	450520	to their usual camping spot on foot.
450520	452920	As they hiked, Jeremy noticed tracks.
452920	455640	It looked like a car and a smaller vehicle,
455640	458840	like a four-wheeler had driven down the trail.
458840	460160	When they arrived at their spot,
460160	463680	there was unusually no firewood waiting for them.
463680	465680	Ash went to chop at a big log
466160	467160	and Jeremy started looking around,
467160	470160	frustrated at the lack of logs.
470160	473960	Ash heard a rustling nearby and saw a man's head pop up
473960	476000	from behind some bushes.
476000	478320	The man made dead eye contact with Ash
478320	481000	and popped back down into the thicket.
481840	485080	Ken Krinklehoff's mom, Krista Krinklehoff,
485080	486720	drove him to the woods in her minivan
486720	488640	and explained she didn't like the tradition
488640	490800	he and his friends had of going to the woods once a year
490800	492120	for their silly game.
492120	493200	Ken said not to worry,
493240	495960	but a baby fox jumped out trying to cross the road.
495960	499920	Ken's mom hid it and crushed the fox without remorse.
499920	501320	They pulled into the parking lot
501320	503760	and saw the same cars Ash and Jeremy saw
503760	506520	plus the 91 Firebird Ash had borrowed.
506520	508400	Ken's mom mentioned how multiple people
508400	510840	who had gone into the woods recently were missing
510840	512440	and she especially wasn't happy
512440	515640	he was going into the woods with Ash and Jeremy.
515640	517560	Ken grabbed his gear, said goodbye,
517560	519280	and headed to the ranger shack.
519280	521640	Buzz introduced himself, took Ken's picture,
521640	525040	asked for his information, and posted it on the board.
525040	527440	After talking about the missing people for a few minutes,
527440	529560	Ken headed off into the woods.
530680	532920	A group of three high school girls
532920	536040	walked into the contention public library.
536040	538840	Judy Krinklehoff, a senior at Silas Cole,
538840	541280	and the older sister of Ken Krinklehoff
541280	544440	still wore the same clothes she bought for freshman year.
544440	546920	She was very anxious, never said the right thing,
546920	548800	and wanted to be in a relationship
548800	550680	with the coolest girl at school,
550680	555440	a rebel who bullied Judy named Elizabeth Liz Lonklin.
555440	558240	Liz wore a leather jacket and Doc Martens,
558240	559640	she smoked cigarettes,
559640	562920	and she was a self-described bitch.
562920	565960	The final girl, Sharon Shadow Berryman,
565960	568120	formerly a popular cheerleader,
568120	571160	was now obsessed with going to graveyards,
571160	573040	funerals, and hospitals
573040	577280	to engage with all forms and stages of death.
577280	580000	Shadow asked Steven Page for the location
580040	582240	of occult books related to voodoo,
582240	584360	and he led them to a small room in the back
584360	587040	with a small sign that read occult.
587040	590040	Inside, they found a book titled Voodoo.
590040	592520	Shadow said they would find what they were looking for
592520	597520	on page 419, and Liz revealed she wanted to torture
598160	601960	someone named Brittany for sleeping with her boyfriend,
601960	605280	all while Judy went on about how beautiful Liz was.
605280	609140	Page 419 described a ritual that must be performed
609140	612380	while surrounded by trees at night.
612380	615660	There were a few ingredients necessary for performing it.
615660	617740	The left pinky toe of a dead squirrel,
617740	619020	dirt scraped from the earth
619020	622100	after it had been stepped on by a menstruating calf,
622100	624660	the blood from a former cheerleader gone goth
624660	629060	who goes to Silas Colquet through 12, and bird pee.
629060	631780	Smash cut to the group leaving the library with the book.
631780	633920	Smash cut to them on the side of the road,
633920	636660	bent over a dead squirrel cutting off its pinky toe.
636660	638420	Smash cut to them in a field,
638420	641460	scooping up dirt under a cow bleeding from its lady butt.
641460	643820	Smash cut to them standing in a parking lot
643820	646220	waiting for a bird to pee slash poo on them.
646220	648740	Smash cut to Shadow scratching herself
648740	650100	with the dead squirrel toe
650100	652340	and dripping her blood into a vial.
652340	655220	Smash cut to two days ago when Shadow told Liz
655220	657180	her boyfriend was cheating on her with Brittany
657180	659060	from Spinkbonk High in the city,
659060	661060	and Shadow and Judy agreed to help Liz
661060	662440	get back at her boyfriend.
662440	664700	Smash cut back to the present,
664700	667020	and the girls were on their way to the woods
667020	670140	with all the necessary ingredients.
670140	671940	Shadow turned onto a gravel road
671940	674020	and a possum walked out in front of the car.
674020	678060	Shadow drove straight for it and crushed it under the car.
678060	679420	She was happy for the possum
679420	681460	since it was in a different place now,
681460	684780	but Judy worried it wasn't going to heaven.
684780	686480	They buried the possum real quick
686480	689180	and then arrived at the contention woods parking lot.
689180	691460	Already in the parking lot were five cars,
691460	695420	the four we expected, plus Krista Krinklehoff's minivan.
695420	696580	Judy freaked out a little
696580	698140	because she saw her mom's minivan
698140	700680	and she was out past her curfew.
700680	703700	Liz and Shadow promised to shove Judy into a ditch
703700	705320	if they saw Krista Krinklehoff,
705320	708380	which assuaged Judy's worries.
708380	711780	An old man wearing a state forest ranger uniform
711780	713580	jumped out and scared the girls.
713580	717180	He introduced himself as Woodrow or Buzz for short
717180	720180	and asked them to fill out some forms in the shack.
720180	725180	Shadow whispered to the rest to not use their real names.
725300	728180	Ash Hornbeam walked over to investigate the bush
728180	731420	after seeing the man's face disappear back behind it,
731420	733140	his ax in hand.
733140	735320	He heard rustling and a chattering sound,
735320	737500	so he ran back to find Jeremy Pettymore,
737500	739140	who was standing at their campsite,
739140	742260	still frustrated at the lack of pre-prepared firewood.
742260	744660	Ash sprinted back and squawked about a man in a bush
744660	746980	by a log making animal noises.
746980	749040	Jeremy readied the gun he found
749040	751180	and Ash led him to the bush.
751180	752900	It was still rustling with movement
752940	755920	and the animal-like noises were still audible.
757180	760980	Ash picked up a long stick and poked at the bush.
760980	763780	Stepping back from the bush was a naked human man
763780	765460	covered in scratches and cuts,
765460	767180	some of which were still bleeding.
767180	771380	He looked at the boys with huge eyes and froze.
771380	773740	Jeremy took out the Polaroid of the Polaroids.
773740	775460	They could tell this was one of the people
775460	776580	who'd gone missing,
776580	778920	though they couldn't quite read his name.
778920	780000	The boys called out to him,
780000	782280	suggested he put on pants and offered to help
782520	783680	with a first aid kit.
783680	785800	The man scampered up to them hastily.
785800	788580	Jeremy pointed the gun at him to no effect.
788580	790520	The man pushed his fingers together,
790520	793840	made sad puppy dog eyes and mewled.
793840	796500	Ash and Jeremy discussed what to do with the animal man
796500	799880	as he sniffed the air and headed to their campsite.
799880	801580	The boys tried to Red Rover him,
801580	804080	but the situation finally sunk into Ash.
804080	807060	He freaked out, backed away and tripped backwards on a log.
807060	809620	Jeremy tried to stop the man alone but wasn't able to.
809620	811760	Both boys had the realization though
812080	815640	that this man did not act or run like a normal human man.
815640	816840	He was too fast.
816840	821360	He was crouched and he used his front legs or arms
821360	824440	to aid his movement toward their campsite.
824440	825980	The boys ran back to their spot,
825980	827760	still holding their weapons.
827760	828600	When they returned,
828600	831240	they saw the man hunched over their bag with food,
831240	833600	going to town on the snacks they brought.
833600	836160	Jeremy cried out for his little Smokies.
836160	839000	After a small tussle between the boys and the naked man,
839000	841120	Ash kicked away the can of Smokies,
841120	843560	kneed him in the face and full nelsoned him
843560	846280	down into the mud, immobilizing him.
846280	848800	Jeremy took a rope, tied him to a tree
848800	852480	and tried to calm him down with more Smokies.
852480	854320	Ash used some hand sanitizer
854320	857600	and headed back down the trail to get buzz.
857600	859500	As Ash headed back to the shack,
859500	861760	the trees around him began to warp.
861760	864300	The trail became nearly non-existent
864300	866800	and he was suddenly looking at a thicket of woods
866800	869240	instead of the trail in front of him.
869240	871040	The sun was going down
871920	873220	and Ash was all by himself
873220	876600	and he had no fucking clue where he was.
878140	879920	Ken Krenkelhoff walked down the trail
879920	881680	and made it to the usual campsite.
881680	884440	When he arrived, he saw Jeremy waving little Smokies
884440	887480	in front of the face of a naked, bloody man
887480	888760	tied up to a tree.
888760	890520	Ken shouted as he entered the clearing,
890520	892780	startling Jeremy Pettymore.
892780	894600	Ken asked if the man could hear him
894600	895560	and if he was all right
895560	898040	and the man made some more chattering noises.
898040	900080	Jeremy indicated this was one of the people
900120	901880	who had gone missing in the woods.
901880	905440	Ash was on his way back to the ranger station to get buzz.
905440	908540	In the meantime, Jeremy was trying to tame the animal man
908540	910680	with tiny meat fellows.
910680	913560	Ken realized that if Ash was going from the campsite
913560	918120	to the ranger shack, they should have crossed paths,
918120	920040	but they didn't.
920040	921960	Ken called out for Ash but stopped
921960	925360	when he looked back at the man and no longer saw humanity.
925360	928140	Only animalistic intent behind the eyes
928140	931500	of this bloody, muddy, tied up naked human body.
931500	933300	Ken freaked out and backed away,
933300	935260	claiming the man wasn't a person.
935260	938460	Jeremy tried to convince him the man was still a man,
938460	940180	but Ken wasn't convinced.
940180	943340	He went back to calling out for Ash's panic rising.
943340	945900	Jeremy wasn't sure why Ken was scared of this man,
945900	948120	whom he had named Rusty.
949720	952860	Shadow, Liz, and Judy were in the contention woods
952860	954780	parking lot talking to Buzz.
954780	956360	Judy worried about her mom
956360	958740	and wondered if she'd also gone missing.
958740	961240	Shadow and Liz calmed her down by suggesting
961240	963200	that perhaps Chris's car was stolen
963200	966600	and so it wasn't actually her that drove it to the woods.
966600	969160	Now back in the shack, Buzz asked the young ladies
969160	971160	to come over and take care of business
971160	972560	so they can be on their way.
972560	974620	They wondered if they should trust the man,
974620	977020	but decided to have their pictures taken anyway.
977020	978160	Glancing around the shack,
978160	979920	they saw various ranger equipment
979920	981720	and the bulletin board of missing people,
981720	985600	as well as a massive jug of hand sanitizer on the windowsill.
985600	988840	Judy furiously pumped hand sanitizer into her hand,
988840	992320	so much so that it overflowed onto the floor.
992320	994520	Liz looked at Judy appalled
994520	996520	and asked Buzz if they could have a machete
996520	999240	to protect themselves from something killing people,
999240	1001040	like maybe Judy's mom.
1001040	1003880	Judy freaked out and started licking the hand sanitizer
1003880	1004880	from her hands.
1004880	1007720	Buzz offered the hand sanitizer to the other two girls.
1007720	1010160	Shadow refused, but Liz put her hand out
1010160	1012840	and as Buzz started to pump out the hand sanitizer,
1012840	1014260	she tried to pull her hand away,
1014260	1016060	but plenty still landed on her,
1016060	1018420	so she unhappily rubbed it in.
1018420	1021120	As Buzz pinned all their information and pictures
1021120	1023200	on the not missing side of the board,
1023200	1026220	the girls noticed a slight trickle of blood
1026220	1030340	going down the back of his neck, staining his uniform.
1033900	1036740	Ash looked around at the ever darkening tree
1036740	1040940	surrounding him as the sun went down.
1040940	1043500	He heard a noise and saw a tree
1043500	1046860	emitting a bright light from a hollow point.
1046860	1048500	He looked around suspiciously,
1048500	1050860	saw a trip wire between him and the tree
1050860	1052780	and carefully avoided it
1052780	1055880	as he walked up to the light emanating knot.
1055880	1058360	It was so bright, Ash couldn't see what was inside,
1058360	1061020	but he knew something was deep in there.
1061020	1064340	Ash pushed his arm into the arm shaped hole
1064340	1068720	up to his elbow, felt around, found nothing,
1068720	1072060	pushed in deeper and when he attempted to pull his arm out,
1072100	1075200	he felt a great pain on his skin,
1075200	1077860	like he was noodling a razor sharp catfish
1077860	1080500	all the way from elbow to fingertip.
1080500	1082460	Ash pulled out about a centimeter
1082460	1087000	and the bit of arm revealed only raw muscle and tendons.
1087000	1090220	It lacked skin completely.
1090220	1091760	He realized he was trapped
1091760	1094480	and for the first time in his life,
1094480	1097980	Ash Hornbeam had no idea what to do.
1098980	1102340	Shadow told Buzz he was bleeding from his head.
1102340	1104740	She offered to trade her first aid kit for his machete
1104740	1106420	and he gladly accepted.
1106420	1108680	She grabbed the kit in a vial and patched him up
1108680	1111740	while discreetly taking a sample of his blood.
1111740	1113760	The group then took stock of their possessions
1113760	1116020	and headed to their designated camping spot
1116020	1118020	to perform the ritual.
1118020	1119740	Upon arrival, there were no rocks
1119740	1121380	around the designated fire pit
1121380	1123380	in order to keep the fire contained.
1123380	1125620	This was very concerning to Judy.
1125620	1126900	Liz went to find some rocks
1126900	1130540	and Shadow swayed in the wind to attune with nature.
1130540	1132180	Judy, worried about her mom
1132180	1134740	and the pond water she just used to brush her teeth,
1134740	1136460	suffered a bout of insanity.
1136460	1138220	She saw reality warp.
1138220	1142560	Shadow blended into the trees and the ground became the sky.
1142560	1146240	Judy promptly ran into the woods in her footy pajamas.
1146240	1149300	Shadow sighed and followed with her machete,
1149300	1151500	leaping and dancing as she went.
1152940	1155180	Liz's reality glitched
1155180	1157140	and she suddenly found herself lost
1157140	1159760	in an unrecognizable part of the woods.
1159760	1162300	Behind some rocks, she saw a fit looking bald man
1162300	1165540	in his forties walking in circles, waving his hands
1165540	1167060	and talking to himself.
1167060	1170900	All on the other side of a thick line of white powder.
1170900	1175700	A branch like sigil was carved into every tree in sight.
1175700	1178780	Liz tried to get away quietly, but she stepped on a stick
1178780	1180980	and he beckoned her over to his little camp
1180980	1182900	with some semi-intelligible,
1182900	1185780	mostly English accented instructions.
1185780	1188660	She went over partly because she found him attractive.
1188660	1192320	He was concerned about two things, the sky turning
1192320	1196220	and keeping the lady in the wood away.
1196220	1200100	A tattoo of a stylized H was slightly hidden
1200100	1201700	on the back of his neck.
1201700	1203180	After a little more discussion,
1203180	1205540	Liz decided she was too worried by the situation
1205540	1206820	and didn't trust him.
1206820	1208740	She ran away as he shouted,
1208740	1211680	she was definitely going to get go.
1212660	1217620	Lost in the woods, Liz Lonklin stumbled upon Ash Hornbeam
1217620	1221740	stuck in a tree with tears streaming down his face.
1221740	1224460	They were understandably surprised to see each other.
1224460	1227140	Ash warned her about the trip wire just in time,
1227140	1229500	but the helpless situation caused him to lose it
1229500	1232360	and pull his arm out a little bit more.
1232360	1235020	The loss of skin was staggering.
1235020	1236820	He threw up at a sheer panic.
1236820	1238660	Liz dipped out, shouting for help.
1239540	1241340	She was leaving Ash alone with the tree once again,
1241340	1245580	staring at his lacerated, dripping arm.
1245580	1247700	Judy ran haphazardly through the woods,
1247700	1249860	but thankfully stopped just before
1249860	1252700	a suspicious looking pile of leaves.
1252700	1256260	Shadow almost danced directly into the dubious detritus,
1256260	1257780	but Judy pulled her out of the way,
1257780	1261460	revealing the 10 foot deep pit underneath the leaf pile.
1261460	1263060	Shaken, but not yet broken,
1263060	1264940	the two headed back to their campsite.
1264940	1267220	They didn't see Liz, but they did see a raccoon
1267220	1270460	sitting there eating just like a person would.
1270460	1273220	The little trash panda indicated that hand sanitizer
1273220	1275920	should not be used, might be deadly.
1275920	1277860	Judy looked into the raccoon's eyes,
1277860	1281220	saw the soul of a human and decided to trust it.
1281220	1284120	Shadow tottered along with T-Rex arms,
1284120	1287620	imitating the raccoon as the trio headed back
1287620	1289860	to the entrance of the woods.
1290800	1292780	After searching through the woods
1292780	1296500	in the dwindling twilight, Liz finally found the trail
1296500	1298820	along with Jeremy Pettymore and Ken Krinkelhoff
1298820	1300060	at their campsite.
1300060	1302620	She saw them talking to a feral man,
1302620	1304420	feeding him little winkies.
1304420	1306660	She told them Ash was in trouble with a tree
1306660	1309180	while Jeremy fed Rusty more smokes.
1309180	1311540	They debated whether or not to take Rusty along
1311540	1312380	for the search.
1312380	1316960	Ken finally agreed to it and Liz Lonklin led the party.
1316960	1319560	Shadow, Judy and the raccoon made their way
1319560	1321620	back to the parking lot and were confronted
1321620	1324960	by Judy's mom's voice coming out of the shack.
1324960	1328040	Judy instinctively ran to get more hand sanitizer
1328040	1330080	from her mom and succeeded in doing so
1330080	1333340	despite the raccoon physically trying to stop her.
1333340	1335480	Krista told the girls that Buzz had asked her
1335480	1339360	to watch the shack while he went to investigate an argument.
1339360	1342320	The raccoon indicated they should get the fuck out of Dodge
1342320	1344720	but Shadow wanted to go back and get Liz.
1344720	1347840	She persuaded Krista to help her find Liz.
1347840	1350320	Judy could stay in the shack with the raccoon.
1350320	1353600	When Shadow and Krista skipped into the forest together,
1353600	1355480	Judy hit the restroom.
1355480	1360480	There she saw the limp, neatly folded body
1360760	1364040	of Ranger Buzz on the floor.
1365920	1370160	Ken Krinklehoff, Jeremy Pettymore, Liz Lonklin and Rusty
1370160	1372980	walked through the woods looking for Ash Hornbeam
1372980	1375520	whose arm was stuck in a tree.
1375520	1379800	The sun had now gone down and they were in total darkness.
1379800	1382880	Too far off the trail, the group began to realize
1382880	1384960	none of them knew where they were.
1384960	1386780	They walked deeper into the woods
1386780	1389600	and eventually saw through the moonlight
1389600	1393000	a picture frame hanging on a tree.
1394320	1398400	Flashback to Ken Krinklehoff a couple years ago.
1398400	1400160	He and his friends were out in the woods
1400160	1403320	on their annual outing to look for Ol' Madge.
1403320	1405100	He popped away to pee behind a tree
1405100	1407520	and as he looked up from his stream of urine,
1407520	1410880	he saw a frame like of a painting
1410920	1413000	hanging there in the woods.
1413000	1415620	It looked like nothing was in the frame.
1415620	1418680	Ken approached and noticed that somewhere along
1418680	1422220	the edge of this frame, something didn't line up
1422220	1425680	as if what was behind the frame wasn't the same
1425680	1427880	as what he could see through it.
1427880	1429560	He strafed to the side to get a better look
1429560	1432320	and saw that beyond the frame was a cabin.
1432320	1435640	Ken walked up to this frame to put his hand through it
1435640	1438200	but at the last second noticed a trip wire
1438200	1440160	he was about to step on.
1440200	1442240	Ken jumped back, grabbed a rock
1442240	1443960	and threw it at the trip wire.
1443960	1447400	A giant wooden spear came flying through the canvas
1447400	1450720	of the painting and stabbed directly into a tree
1450720	1452440	just missing Ken.
1452440	1455800	He rushed back to the camp while convincing himself
1455800	1457320	it wasn't real.
1457320	1460880	Flashback forward to Jeremy, Liz, Ken and Rusty
1460880	1463600	standing in the clearing looking at the weird frame.
1463600	1467280	Ken yelled out for everyone to stop and not go any closer.
1467320	1470360	He pointed at the ground and next to the frame
1470360	1471880	there was a trip wire.
1471880	1474240	He tossed a small log onto the trip wire
1474240	1476720	and a massive spear shot through the frame
1476720	1479400	directly into a nearby tree.
1479400	1481680	Ken shared his memory with the rest of the party
1481680	1484400	and as they all looked at this frame
1484400	1486480	they could see a cabin in the woods
1486480	1488300	through the spear made hole.
1488300	1492120	Ken snapped, grabbed the spear and raced toward the cabin.
1492120	1493760	As Jeremy yelled at him to stop,
1493760	1496960	Ken stepped on a pile of leaves covering a hole
1497520	1499480	and disappeared into the ground.
1500960	1504400	Ash Hornbeam stood in the woods terrified.
1504400	1508240	His arm stuck halfway into the hollow of a tree.
1508240	1510520	Part of his arm that he could see had been stripped
1510520	1513160	of every layer of flesh.
1513160	1516440	The sun finished going down and Ash stood alone
1516440	1518320	in the moonlight.
1518320	1520600	He heard the snap of a branch nearby
1520600	1523180	and out of the trees approached a man
1523180	1526360	in a black suit, white shirt and bolo tie.
1526400	1529400	He was a fit man in his late 20s or early 30s
1529400	1531920	with a glorious mustache and pants
1531920	1533840	that were a bit too tight.
1533840	1536720	He flashed an FBI badge and introduced himself
1536720	1538360	as Agent Kevin.
1538360	1540760	He asked Ash why he was out in the woods.
1540760	1542880	Ash said he and some friends come out to the woods
1542880	1545140	every year to camp and look for old Madge,
1545140	1547800	a woman in the woods from local legend.
1547800	1551640	Kevin cursed, thanked him and with a trembling hand
1551640	1554940	pressed a gun to the back of Ash's head.
1554940	1557860	Acting on pure instinct, Ash reached into his pocket,
1557860	1560460	pulled out a lighter and some firecrackers,
1560460	1564740	lit them with one hand and held them against Kevin's head.
1564740	1566800	Kevin lowered his gun, grabbed the fireworks
1566800	1568540	and threw them away.
1568540	1572340	On closer inspection, Kevin recognized Ash as a local kid
1572340	1574100	who was celebrated in the community
1574100	1577380	after he defended his home from a couple burglars.
1577380	1578860	Flashback!
1578860	1582000	To a younger Ash Hornbeam sitting on his front porch
1582000	1583800	wrapped in a crisis blanket,
1583800	1586880	talking to a contention police officer.
1586880	1589520	Ash had heard noises in his basement
1589520	1591700	and it sounded like two men's voices,
1591700	1595320	one tall and skinny, the other short and fat.
1595320	1598440	Ash thought they were after his dad's coin collection.
1598440	1599560	Flashback!
1599560	1604380	To a few hours before this to Ash home alone watching TV.
1604380	1606900	On the screen is a commercial for a CD player
1606900	1609840	Ash desperately wanted but couldn't afford.
1609840	1611760	So he hatched a plan to steal
1611760	1614880	some of his dad's rare coin collection.
1614880	1618100	He tried typing in birthdays into the lock box
1618100	1621920	that contained the coins and his birthday worked.
1621920	1626360	Ash took a handful, roughly $600 worth of coins.
1626360	1627720	Flashback forward!
1627720	1631080	To the officer asking Ash about the paint cans
1631080	1633000	hanging from strings.
1633000	1635260	Ash said he set up traps and tripwires
1635260	1638880	and told an epic story of utilizing these common objects
1638880	1642240	to hassle the robbers until they gave up and left.
1642240	1644080	Flash a bit more forward!
1644080	1647800	To Ash carrying his new CD player with him
1647800	1649760	everywhere he went.
1649760	1651720	Flash fully back forward!
1651720	1656080	To Kevin returning to the trapped Ash
1656080	1658640	along with a woman wearing a black suit,
1658640	1661040	white shirt and a black tie.
1661040	1663440	She held a machete and she chanted
1663440	1666600	while she rubbed a hand on the blade.
1666600	1669580	The woman smiled a cold, vacant smile
1669580	1673500	behind asymmetrical bangs covering one of her eyes.
1673500	1677400	Agent Kevin introduced her as Agent Karen
1677400	1680440	and she immediately lifted the machete above her head
1680440	1683440	and brought it down through Ash's elbow.
1683440	1685840	Out of shock, Ash stepped back, looked down
1685840	1689000	and saw his arm had been cut off.
1689000	1692040	The end of it was completely cauterized
1692040	1695400	and the skin around the stump began to grow back
1695400	1697040	as he watched.
1697040	1699840	Agent Karen said nothing, just smiled,
1699840	1702520	turned around and walked away.
1702520	1704360	Agent Kevin put his arm around Ash
1704360	1708540	and led him to a black sedan sitting next to a four wheeler
1708540	1711000	in the middle of the woods.
1711000	1715760	Through some brush and trees, they could see a cabin.
1717560	1721080	Shadow and Krista Krinklehoff walked down the trail
1721080	1724380	and Shadow sang a song about death.
1724380	1727260	The sun finished setting and they continued to walk
1727260	1729420	lit only by a flashlight.
1729420	1732420	Krista said she saw Liz and shot off with the flashlight
1732420	1736260	into the woods followed by a giggling Shadow.
1736260	1739360	But then Shadow watched the flashlight go completely dark
1739360	1741940	and felt a rope tighten around her ankle.
1741940	1744320	She was hoisted into the air upside down
1744320	1745960	hanging by one foot.
1745960	1749700	Krista turned on the flashlight under her chin
1749700	1753280	like it was spooky story time.
1753280	1758280	She said, my darling, it is certifiably unfortunate
1759800	1762520	that your demise is seemingly necessary
1762520	1765600	despite my finding your demeanor so appropriate
1765600	1766840	for your kind.
1768240	1772640	From your personal hymns, I can assume and do hope
1772640	1775980	that a lack of existence is your preference?
1776920	1780720	Shadow whispered to herself, finally.
1781720	1786720	And she watched a long silver tendril grow from the back
1787200	1790880	of Krista Krinklehoff's neck and then another
1790880	1793280	and another and another.
1793280	1796920	The limbs extended towards Shadow's pinoted body
1796920	1801200	and the camera panned down to show the long shadows
1801200	1803760	play out the grizzly scene.
1803760	1807840	One of the shiny tentacles sliced into the soft tissue
1807880	1809240	on the back of her neck.
1809240	1812920	Another snapped her head forward and a third reached in
1812920	1817360	and gripped her spinal cord and ripped it out of her body
1817360	1822180	delivering Shadow to her finish line, her goal,
1822180	1827180	her lack of a destination and finally she felt nothing.
1829400	1832520	The sun had set and as it began to rain outside
1832520	1835920	Judy Krinklehoff stood at the doorway to the bathroom
1836000	1841000	and stared at the lifeless folded crumpled body of Buzz.
1841440	1844720	She could tell by looking around there'd been a tussle
1844720	1848080	and she found a stick of her mom's favorite brand
1848080	1850920	of chapstick behind the toilet.
1850920	1853280	The raccoons stood in the doorway motioning
1853280	1855160	to get the fuck out of there.
1855160	1858880	Judy followed the raccoon into the rain into the darkness
1858880	1862100	and a lightning bolt flashed in the distance.
1862100	1867100	It was just bright enough to illuminate a blood covered
1867620	1872620	Krista Krinklehoff walking directly toward her.
1872640	1875420	The raccoon at Judy's side shivered
1875420	1878300	and tried to communicate tugging at Judy's arm
1878300	1882940	but eventually ran away when Judy went to help her mother.
1882940	1885480	Judy guided her back to the shack to clean up
1885480	1889260	her blood drenched mother but when she closed the door
1889260	1892380	Judy felt a pinch on the back of her neck.
1892380	1897060	She turned and saw her mom's body had crumpled to the ground
1897060	1900500	and standing in front of her was a small one inch
1900500	1904460	silver sphere with metallic arms grounding itself
1904460	1907060	in the walls and ceiling of the shack.
1907060	1910900	Shiny tendrils reached out, snapped Judy's neck forward
1910900	1914320	and ripped out her spine shoving itself
1914320	1917140	into her spinal column.
1917140	1921720	Judy Krinklehoff was no longer Judy Krinklehoff.
1921720	1924960	She was an objective based entity
1924960	1928400	and its current objective was to collect
1928400	1931540	as many bodies as possible.
1932460	1935660	After falling into the hidden hole under the pile of leaves
1935660	1940100	Ken Krinklehoff slid on his back down an earthy viscous slide
1940100	1943180	for some time until he finally landed in a pit
1943180	1945980	of cold dirt and perfect darkness.
1945980	1949220	He was in a small crawl space with what looked like
1949220	1952860	floor supports though they were translucent tubes
1952860	1956500	filled with a squamous black ooze that traveled down
1956500	1960140	from the cabin into the ground below.
1960140	1963460	Ken also saw a door above him and he cautiously listened
1963460	1965800	for any sound on the other side.
1966660	1970060	Ash Hornbeam followed agents Kevin and Karen
1970060	1973580	to the black sedan and four wheeler hidden in the brush.
1973580	1975580	There was another agent in the backseat wearing
1976020	1977580	the same black suit with a white shirt.
1977580	1981660	The man in his early 30s had buzzed blonde hair
1981660	1984820	and introduced himself as Agent Kyle.
1984820	1987700	As Ash looked out ahead of him he saw the cabin
1987700	1989380	in a small clearing.
1989380	1992020	Next to the cabin sat a small shipping container
1992020	1994460	and a large yellow excavator.
1994460	1997140	A moat surrounded the clearing.
1997140	1999680	Ash saw movement just outside the moat.
1999680	2002980	Liz, Jeremy and Ken stopped to talk.
2002980	2005380	Ken picked up a small log, threw it
2006220	2008460	and a long wooden spear flew in their direction
2008460	2009580	and hit a tree.
2009580	2012300	Ken grabbed the spear, took off running, fell into the
2012300	2014600	ground and disappeared.
2014600	2017560	Kevin turned back to Ash and broke his mind
2017560	2019760	with two sentences.
2019760	2023340	The woods are full of traps and Ol' Madge,
2023340	2028000	the local legend the boys searched for annually was real.
2028000	2029940	Ash couldn't handle it, something snapped,
2029940	2032520	he bailed out of the car, ran and disappeared
2032520	2033540	into the night.
2034380	2037480	Jeremy and Liz stood in the dark of the woods
2037480	2040620	when they saw Ken disappear into the ground
2040620	2042100	and it began to rain.
2042100	2044600	They looked forward, the cabin lights turned on
2044600	2047620	and they noticed a storage container and a big yellow
2047620	2051620	excavator next to the cabin all encircled by a moat.
2051620	2053500	The pair moved forward to investigate the cabin
2053500	2056300	and found the moat was about five feet across.
2056300	2058980	Jeremy threw some smokies onto the other side
2058980	2062820	and held Rusty's feet as he lunged across to grab
2062820	2064960	the small sausage boys.
2064960	2067700	Liz crossed Rusty's back without issue but Jeremy
2067700	2070720	and Rusty fell into the fish filled moat.
2070720	2073780	They crawled out near Liz, a wet mess.
2073780	2076740	The trio approached the cabin slowly.
2076740	2079720	Liz stumbled up the stairs to look through the window
2079720	2083640	and she saw strange lab equipment and translucent tubes
2083640	2086880	that ran down into the floorboards filled with a
2086880	2090400	squamous black viscous goo.
2090400	2093240	Papers were scattered across tables and a desk
2093240	2097560	and in the corner sat a large wooden trunk.
2097560	2101080	Jeremy edged toward the storage unit, opened the door
2101080	2105320	and saw on one side a closet full of clothes
2105320	2107960	and on the other side lined up against the wall
2107960	2112960	the bodies of roughly 15 people hung limply on hooks
2113000	2115880	from a pole in the back of each neck.
2115880	2119040	Jeremy turned and screamed at Liz they needed to get
2119040	2122880	the fuck out of there and the pair bolted across the moat.
2122880	2126300	As they ran Liz heard a click under her foot.
2126300	2129840	She tried to stop in time but a giant metal cloth
2129840	2134240	swung down from the branch above and removed her head
2134240	2136240	from her shoulders.
2136240	2140680	Jeremy knew she was dead, he kept running.
2140680	2144720	Ash Hornbeam also ran through the dark rainy night.
2144720	2147080	He found the trail and in the distance he saw
2147080	2149600	Judy Krinklehoff walking toward him.
2149600	2152460	Ash grabbed her arm and kept running, pulling her with him.
2152460	2154360	They arrived at his usual campsite.
2154360	2157840	Ash fell to his knees, gasped for air and told Judy
2157840	2161200	her brother disappeared into a hole in the ground.
2161200	2165360	Judy seemed unworried by this news and suggested finding
2165360	2167140	some large rocks.
2167140	2170040	Ash continued to panic and freak out and Judy went to go
2170040	2171560	find some rocks.
2171560	2174960	Ash considered his options but decided to stay with Judy
2174960	2178000	for now since he did have a crush on her.
2178000	2183000	Judy found a huge rock, walked up behind Ash and crushed
2183500	2185520	his head in.
2185520	2189220	Ken Krinklehoff crouched in the crawl space under the cabin
2189220	2191840	lit only by his flashlight.
2191840	2194840	He gently put his ear to the door above him and heard
2194840	2197160	a muffled yell in the distance.
2197160	2201960	It was Jeremy screaming for Liz to get the fuck out of here.
2201960	2204160	Ken poked his head up through the door.
2204200	2207140	This was not a cabin, it was a lab.
2207140	2211040	The same translucent tubes full of black ooze were all
2211040	2214840	around the room going into the floor and Ken saw the tubes
2214840	2219040	were coming from small coffin shaped boxes.
2219040	2222160	There was a desk littered with papers, a bulletin board
2222160	2224580	and a large wooden trunk.
2224580	2227620	Ken heard a guttural scream cut short and looked out the
2227620	2231360	window at the exact moment Liz Lonklin was stopped dead
2231360	2236360	in her tracks by the decapitation from a massive metal claw.
2237880	2241140	Having convinced himself that what he just saw could not
2241140	2244200	have been real, Ken turned back around and investigated
2244200	2245400	the scene.
2245400	2249880	He found articles of organization for a new business called
2249880	2254880	Cole's Orphanage, New School Under Modern Etiquette.
2255720	2259720	All the other papers were blueprints for an odd looking gun
2259720	2263040	which seemed to have been recently completed.
2263040	2267160	There were also plans for small metal spheres one inch
2267160	2272160	in diameter which were being placed into small human bodies.
2272400	2275760	Ken took a wary glance at the little coffins.
2275760	2279200	He opened one and a black viscous goo began pouring out of it
2279200	2281000	onto the table and floor.
2281000	2284960	Inside the coffin there sat the body of a two year old
2284960	2289200	that was not quite fully human looking as if it was being
2289720	2293720	3D printed and was not yet finished like a face with a
2293720	2295560	plastic bag over it.
2295560	2299760	Ken freaked the fuck out and ran for the front door
2299760	2300720	of the cabin.
2301880	2304480	Jeremy Pettymore ran desperately through the woods
2304480	2307720	and eventually found Judy Krinkelhoff walking toward him.
2307720	2310200	Judy said she didn't know what to do since the other girls
2310200	2311840	had left her alone.
2311840	2314480	The two decided to head back to the ranger shack.
2314480	2316040	Jeremy took the lead.
2316040	2319240	Judy pulled out the machete she was hiding and lunged
2319240	2322600	at the Pettymore boy but she slipped on the muddy rocks
2322600	2327600	below, fell face first onto the machete and split her skull
2327600	2332600	wide open enough for Jeremy to see a small one inch
2332800	2337160	in diameter silver sphere in the middle of her head.
2337160	2342160	Black ooze began to leak onto the trail and Jeremy ran.
2343160	2347040	Ken stumbled out of the cabin and saw three figures
2347040	2348200	approaching.
2348200	2351040	Through the rain and darkness a lightning strike in the
2351040	2353440	distance revealed the trio.
2353440	2356560	All wearing black suits with white shirts, two with black
2356560	2359440	ties and one with a bolo tie.
2359440	2362520	The tall one had buzz blonde hair, the man with the bolo
2362520	2366160	tie was shorter, sported tight pants and a thick mustache
2366160	2370800	and the last was a woman smiling a cold, vacant smile
2370840	2375480	behind asymmetrical bangs covering one of her eyes.
2375480	2379040	They saw Ken and the woman began chanting.
2379040	2382920	Ken turned to rush back into the cabin, his arm reached out
2382920	2387920	for the door and his hand phased into and through the wood.
2388200	2392040	He felt an aberrant push in the back and his body too
2392040	2394960	was forced into the door.
2394960	2399960	Ken Krinklehoff was trapped halfway in and halfway out
2400080	2402880	the entrance and exit of this cabin.
2402880	2406600	His mind worked just long enough to watch the suits
2406600	2408520	ransack the lab.
2408520	2412200	One grabbed a bucket of water filled with fish to splash
2412200	2413640	and repel the ooze.
2413640	2418200	The other two took some papers in the trunk and they left
2418200	2422080	but not before the woman chanted once more and ignited
2422080	2425720	the cabin in unnatural flames.
2425720	2429560	Ken Krinklehoff died burning part of the cabin
2430080	2431280	in the contention woods.
2433360	2438360	Jeremy Pettymore now all alone ran back to the ranger shack
2438520	2440160	in the parking lot.
2440160	2443040	He got to the Bronco with the keys he had nabbed earlier
2443040	2444600	but the car wouldn't start.
2444600	2447720	He got out and then the heavy rain and darkness of night
2447720	2451060	he ran down the road toward town.
2451060	2455160	Behind Jeremy, the black sedan drove furiously into view
2455160	2457240	and behind it the four wheeler.
2457240	2460720	As they approached, the four wheeler overtook the sedan
2460720	2464760	and pulled up next to Jeremy as he desperately sprinted.
2464760	2467880	Jeremy looked over and the man who drove this ATV
2467880	2471120	was pretty fit for his early 40s and he wore a black suit
2471120	2473880	with a white shirt and a bolo tie below a face
2473880	2476120	with a badass mustache.
2476120	2480000	He recognized the man as John Lee Pettymore III,
2480000	2481840	his second cousin.
2481840	2486240	The two came to a stop and Jeremy waved and tried to hop
2486280	2487640	on the four wheeler.
2487640	2491040	John, John, Uncle John, Uncle John.
2491040	2495920	John stopped, saw Jeremy and his heart sank.
2495920	2498780	Uncle John, thank God you're here.
2498780	2500100	What's wrong, Uncle John?
2500100	2503980	John Lee Pettymore III lifted a pistol
2503980	2507040	and put it to his second cousin's head.
2507040	2511440	Jeremy Pettymore, 14 years old, closed his eyes tight,
2511440	2515880	shaking, he felt the gun against his head trembling.
2517040	2519440	And then there was nothing.
2521200	2523800	Now, back to the contention boys.
2523800	2526920	Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna and John Lee Pettymore IV
2526920	2529560	and the body of John Lee Pettymore III
2529560	2533360	woke up, bodies fully in shock, ears ringing,
2533360	2538360	bellies weirdly satisfied and an uncomfortably savory smell
2539200	2543300	in their nostrils as their eyes adjusted to see
2543300	2547580	the inside of a mausoleum splattered in blood.
2547580	2550560	They remembered everything that had happened to them before
2550560	2553280	but they seemed to be back in the same physical
2553280	2556280	and mental state they were in just after meeting
2556280	2559640	the chanting cloaked old Clark.
2559640	2563280	According to Clark's watch, it was the day of the funeral
2563280	2566160	at 1 p.m. again.
2567040	2570280	Keith ripped his shirt off and found the word Marvin
2570280	2574000	that had been burned into his chest had been crossed out.
2574000	2576560	The other names, Tildy on their dominant palms,
2576560	2579520	Drew on their backs and Maggie on the bottom
2579520	2581920	of their left feet were still branded
2581920	2585040	on each of their bodies the same as before.
2585040	2587960	They wondered whether Marvin would still be dead
2587960	2590440	and theorized that they'd have to work their way
2590440	2592040	through the other names as well.
2592040	2595520	Would they have to kill Maggie and Drew?
2595560	2597960	And how would they find Tildy?
2597960	2600680	John called Rosemary, she picked up
2600680	2602820	and he immediately hung up.
2602820	2605780	John recalled the vision he'd had the last time
2605780	2607640	they were at the cemetery.
2607640	2610360	Keith told the others about the visions he had
2610360	2612740	while wearing his father's watch.
2612740	2615360	Clark suggested calling Maggie and reporting
2615360	2618500	that he'd successfully killed Stan Manstein
2618500	2622920	but first he tried to summon old Clark.
2622920	2626920	He only succeeded in driving himself into a rage
2626920	2629080	and he charged John.
2629080	2631160	When they finally sorted themselves out,
2631160	2635440	the CPD-3 exited the mausoleum and again
2635440	2638960	encountered the old lady who freaked out.
2638960	2641640	She'd already seen them leave the tomb earlier.
2641640	2644880	The gang of risen ex-cops scared her off
2644880	2647940	and discussed the implications of this news.
2647940	2649720	They considered just waiting around
2649720	2652460	for their next iterations to come out of the mausoleum
2652860	2655680	but decided instead to call Maggie.
2657540	2661180	The vision Clark received when he tried to summon himself
2661180	2664260	became instantly clear in his mind.
2664260	2668180	A candlelit stone room contained a hooded figure
2668180	2673180	scribbling furiously into an ornately decorated book
2673600	2677300	made of strange leather.
2677300	2682220	This figure was an elderly decrepit Clark Bishop.
2682220	2684940	There was a knock on the door and a voice called,
2684940	2689940	my Lord, my Lord, as the door opened up.
2690220	2694500	Cut to a silver accord flying down the highway
2694500	2697340	driven by a frantic Maggie Cook.
2697340	2700880	He saw her call him on her phone.
2700880	2704460	Clark blinked away this unnatural vision
2704460	2709420	and suddenly the phone in his pocket began to buzz.
2709420	2711420	Clark answered and Maggie told him
2711460	2714700	to get to the parking lot immediately to meet her.
2714700	2717060	John and Keith joined even though they disagreed
2717060	2719100	with Clark about trusting her.
2719100	2722620	Maggie sped into the parking lot and pulled up next to them.
2722620	2727620	She tasked them with taking out a man named Bruce Robin
2728620	2731100	as he had gone fully insane
2731100	2735180	and was a danger to the world at large.
2735180	2739460	She was shook by the appearance of John Lee Pettymore III
2739460	2742820	and they quickly explained that whole situation.
2742820	2747180	She did not take it well and they had to calm her down.
2747180	2749700	Clark grabbed the burner phone from his car
2749700	2752220	and saw a text that read,
2752220	2756720	your parents owned an artifact of immense power,
2756720	2760300	too much power for them to be trusted with.
2760300	2762920	He responded, what artifact?
2763980	2768340	Maggie asked her former coworkers to murder Bruce Robin,
2768340	2771500	owner of Bar Corp and former business partner
2771500	2774700	of Keith's brother, Ferguson Beans.
2774700	2778560	John began to question Maggie on how she was still alive,
2778560	2782740	but the ringing of her cell phone cut off Maggie's reply.
2782740	2784180	As Clark rejoined the group,
2784180	2787280	he noted a second cell phone vibrating
2787280	2789420	from within the chief's car.
2789420	2792420	On the call, Maggie berated Leon,
2792420	2794820	told him to do his fucking job.
2794820	2797220	He needed to knock the dust off his knuckles
2797220	2800660	because he knew what needed to be done.
2800660	2802660	She hung up and explained,
2802660	2805020	she never died, just had to disappear.
2805020	2806760	She implied the body they'd found
2806760	2809400	in the remains of her house was a decoy.
2809400	2812300	Maggie tossed the officers a manila envelope,
2812300	2816740	reminded them she was counting on this and drove away.
2816740	2819680	The manila envelope had a manila folder inside
2819680	2823620	labeled Operation Hole Puncher, Bar Corp.
2823620	2825960	It contained information on Bar Corp,
2825960	2830400	including its three subsidiaries, Jesus Christ Ministries,
2830400	2833040	Health and Rehabilitation Unlimited,
2833040	2835220	and The Learning Center.
2835220	2838480	It also showed finances for the last five years
2838480	2841680	and profits had been steadily rising.
2841680	2845800	The previous year, they made over $850 million
2845800	2848400	and paid zero in taxes,
2848400	2852080	and they were projected to make over $2 billion
2852080	2853540	in the current year.
2853540	2857420	It was also noted that after being declared deceased,
2857420	2860960	Ferguson Beans' majority share was split
2860960	2864740	between his wife Stacy, daughter Frances,
2864740	2868140	and the mill on the other side of the city,
2868140	2872620	which secured Bruce Robin as the majority owner.
2872620	2875580	John mentioned he recently sold that cocaine
2875580	2877420	they'd found in the storage units
2877420	2880140	to Jesus Christ Ministries,
2880140	2883060	a church camp just outside the city.
2883060	2888060	Clark told John they saw Marvin Glass split his body in half
2888100	2891700	to reveal a silver ball inside his head.
2891700	2893500	John explained his working theory
2893500	2896820	was that all the officers might be bald.
2896820	2900060	He explained that upon the death of his original body,
2900060	2903860	he burst out and went into John Lee Kevinmore's body.
2903860	2905180	He believed this was possible
2905180	2908660	because he was just a little silver ball.
2908660	2911260	Clark described the actions of Rosemary
2911260	2915300	in her final moments inside the flooded Glass office.
2915300	2917340	John asserted her turn on Marvin
2917340	2919700	may have been due to her infatuation
2919700	2922420	with Marvin's son, Jermaine Glass,
2922420	2927420	the man who disappeared when he used the odd-looking gun.
2928260	2930820	After a quick confession from Keith
2930820	2934340	detailing the murder of his own brother by proxy
2934340	2938120	as well as the firsthand murder of Bruce Robin's mother,
2938120	2940140	the former contention police officers
2940140	2943660	traveled to Robin's home address downtown in the city,
2943660	2948660	hoping to find personal files and or Bruce Robin himself.
2949740	2950900	However, when they arrived,
2950900	2952980	they found police tape across the door
2952980	2954820	of Robin's brownstone.
2954820	2956340	The residence was wrecked
2956340	2959220	and human excrement was strewn throughout.
2959220	2961940	The stench was overwhelming.
2961940	2963780	Spray paint covered the walls.
2963780	2968020	It repeated the same number pattern over and over.
2968020	2973020	8118189520131181119.
2975100	2976780	John checked upstairs.
2976780	2981780	His hair stood on end with the feeling of a heavy presence.
2982220	2984820	In a room deemed to be a former office,
2984820	2988740	the same set of numbers was carved into the walls
2988740	2993740	again and again and again on every surface in the room.
2993780	2995380	Clark investigated what he thought
2995380	2998260	might once have been the master bedroom
2998260	3001140	and found various sleeping pallets.
3001140	3003660	It was clear as many as 20 people
3003660	3006460	had been sleeping in this room at one time.
3006460	3008820	John called the city PD
3008820	3012860	under the cover of having tracked a drifter to this home.
3012860	3016340	He requested any information they'd uncovered at the scene.
3016340	3017860	The city officer shared
3017860	3020820	that Bruce Robin went missing two days ago.
3020820	3024700	His neighbors spoke about how crazy Bruce had been recently.
3024820	3027340	He'd had all kinds of people coming in and out
3027340	3029300	at all times of the day and night.
3029300	3032340	The steep decline of Bruce Robin
3032340	3035580	had been a rapid transformation.
3035580	3036980	On their way out to the car,
3036980	3039660	they noted again the sickly green hue
3039660	3041900	of the city around them.
3041900	3045220	The putrid smell, the oppressive grays,
3045220	3049380	the bloated and lifeless faces of the people on the streets.
3049380	3051380	And in contrast to all this,
3051380	3054980	the beautiful blooming flowers on every corner
3054980	3057580	and from every crack in the sidewalk.
3057580	3062220	John asked a passerby why he was so pallid and corpse-like.
3062220	3064140	The man explained that work at Bar Corp
3064140	3065580	had been hard as of late,
3065580	3069260	though they'd just been given some days off.
3069260	3071620	He felt the color was actually probably better now
3071620	3073060	than it had been recently.
3073060	3076860	Bar Corp was surprisingly paying all employees
3076860	3079420	time and a half to take two weeks off.
3079420	3081420	John asked why a big corporation like that
3081420	3084060	would pay its staff to take time off.
3084060	3084980	The man wasn't sure,
3084980	3088420	but it might have to do with the new CEO.
3088420	3092860	Bruce Robin announced he would renovate every building
3092860	3096020	and provide everyone a livable wage,
3096020	3099060	benefits and better working hours.
3099060	3101500	Clark asked what exactly Bar Corp does.
3101500	3102940	Do they sell something?
3102940	3106260	The man asked Clark to pull anything out of his pockets.
3106260	3108020	Clark produced a pin
3108020	3109700	and the man said Bar Corp made it.
3109700	3114100	Sure enough, the pin read Bar Corp there along the side.
3114100	3115660	The party hatched a plan.
3115660	3118180	Keith would call Bruce Robin directly
3118180	3120100	under the guise of commiseration
3120100	3122740	over the death of Ferguson Beans.
3122740	3124900	But a woman named Winifred Worth
3124900	3127180	answered for Bruce Robin's office.
3127180	3129540	Keith explained Ferguson Beans was his brother
3129540	3132340	to which Winifred expressed condolences.
3132340	3134420	Keith requested to speak to Bruce
3134420	3136500	to ask him some questions.
3136500	3139620	Winifred promised she would pass along the questions
3139620	3141500	to Bruce for him.
3141500	3142420	Keith pressed her.
3142420	3143980	He'd hoped to have a conversation
3143980	3146100	with his late brother's business partner.
3146100	3147340	She insisted.
3147340	3149780	While Bruce was currently in the office,
3149780	3152460	he was currently unavailable.
3152460	3154180	Keith found out Bruce's office
3154180	3156860	was on the 17th floor and hung up.
3156860	3159380	He then called the number for Ferguson's office,
3159380	3162620	but he was greeted again by Winifred.
3162620	3166460	Keith tried to disguise his identity as Ferguson,
3166460	3169380	but Keith, caught in the act, just hung up.
3169380	3172540	The group decided since they knew where Bruce Robin was,
3172540	3174540	they would head that way and barge in
3174540	3177380	as officers of the law to question him.
3178300	3179500	On the way to Bar Corp,
3179500	3184060	the fellas noticed both flowers and sickness everywhere.
3184060	3187020	After a diversion to acquire blue windbreakers,
3187020	3189100	coveralls, and fancy hats,
3189100	3192020	they pulled up to the 17-story building
3192020	3194380	and walked through the revolving doors
3194420	3198300	into a massive foyer with marble columns.
3198300	3200220	A security guard and a receptionist
3200220	3203100	stood at a large marble desk,
3203100	3206060	behind which hung a giant mural
3206060	3209060	of Washington crossing the Delaware,
3209060	3213580	but all the guns were replaced by flowers.
3213580	3218140	The building directory showed only 12 of the 17 floors.
3218140	3220220	John fast-talked the security guard
3220220	3222900	and the group found their way into the only elevator
3222900	3226860	that actually went all the way to the 17th floor.
3226860	3228940	On 17, they were met straight away
3228940	3232980	by a small older woman with a shock of white hair.
3232980	3236460	Winifred Worth wore a white satin blouse
3236460	3239660	with black vertical stripes on the left-hand side,
3239660	3242420	high-waisted pants with horizontal stripes
3242420	3244180	on the right-hand side,
3244180	3247580	white platform shoes with studded soles,
3247580	3252300	and interconnected silver rings across her right hand.
3252340	3255020	She knew they were the disgraced police officers
3255020	3258900	from contention and she demanded to know their business.
3258900	3260620	John attempted to persuade her
3260620	3263260	to let them into Bruce Robin's office.
3263260	3264900	She was not convinced.
3264900	3268460	John's solution was to push this 71-year-old lady
3268460	3271980	to the ground and holler for the others to run past.
3271980	3273940	John called an ambulance for her
3273940	3277300	and gave Keith's name as the caller.
3277300	3280460	Keith picked the lock to get into Bruce's office,
3280460	3283500	which was in a state of disarray.
3283500	3286100	A large bookcase had been ransacked.
3286100	3288900	A conference table was absolutely covered
3288900	3291380	in binders, files, and papers.
3291380	3294300	Behind an equally cluttered desk,
3294300	3297420	a panicked Bruce Robin paced back and forth
3297420	3300140	and muttered numbers to himself.
3300140	3303260	He wore a disheveled but well-tailored suit
3303260	3305820	and his hair was a disaster.
3305820	3307020	Bruce greeted them
3307020	3309860	and the officers asked him about the numbers.
3309900	3311860	He denied he was even saying numbers
3311860	3314380	and became aggravated when pushed.
3314380	3316780	They asked if he knew who Keith was.
3316780	3318100	While Bruce considered this,
3318100	3320460	they noticed his bleeding knuckles
3320460	3323700	and the silver ring with a flat blank top
3323700	3325220	on his middle finger,
3325220	3328900	exactly like the one they found at Jim Cook's house.
3328900	3332060	Keith revealed the ring he had tied around his neck
3332060	3335860	with a shoestring and Bruce's eyes went wide
3335860	3338540	with fear and excitement.
3338540	3341380	He asked if they were with Myriad.
3341380	3345100	Keith said yes and put the ring on.
3346140	3348860	Bruce stared off above their heads
3348860	3352140	through a curtain of unwashed hair
3352140	3354220	and began chanting,
3354220	3356820	Tawil Alakol.
3356820	3360100	Clark leapt across the desk, tackle punched him,
3360100	3362660	and knocked a hidden pistol out of his hand,
3362660	3364820	but Bruce kept chanting.
3364820	3367500	Keith tried to stomp on his arm to take the ring,
3367500	3370940	but Robin used the momentum to pull Keith to the ground.
3370940	3373740	John tried and failed to gag the chanting man
3373740	3375940	with his own tie.
3375940	3377540	Bruce threw Clark off of him
3377540	3380620	and reached the fallen gun chanting the whole time.
3380620	3384180	Keith instinctively shot the once again armed CEO
3384180	3387820	to protect Clark, but it only wounded the businessman.
3387820	3390140	John demanded Bruce stop chanting
3390140	3392780	and went to check on Winifred.
3392780	3395740	However, Bruce Robin completed the chant
3395740	3399860	and promptly shot himself in the head.
3399860	3403340	Keith took the ring off Bruce's limp finger.
3403340	3404380	When he stood back up,
3404380	3409380	he noticed John was writing numbers on the desk in blood.
3409420	3412140	Clark stopped him, but John strangely wasn't aware
3412140	3414220	he'd been writing any numbers.
3414220	3417700	Suddenly, the doors to the office burst open
3417700	3420180	and the trio realized they no longer stood
3420180	3423500	in the places they'd had just been standing.
3423500	3426020	They were stark naked and drenched
3426020	3428300	in Bruce Robin's blood.
3428300	3433300	The numbers 218213518152914 were scrawled
3435140	3440140	in dark red fluid on every surface of the office
3440580	3445580	and the gang had no recollection of their actions.
3447340	3449660	When the doors to the office busted open,
3449660	3451860	three police officers barged in
3451860	3454540	as John, Clark, and Keith became aware
3454540	3457860	of their abruptly changed surroundings.
3457860	3460180	Clark recognized the officer at the back,
3460180	3465180	an attractive older man with gray hair as Leon Simpson.
3465300	3468260	Leon dropped two duffel bags on the ground
3468260	3472580	and expeditiously executed the other two officers
3472580	3473580	from behind.
3473580	3476700	He then marched back out into the hallway
3476700	3480900	and fired a single additional shot.
3480900	3483060	Clark told the other two this newcomer
3483060	3486100	was from the circle of knowledge.
3486100	3488980	Leon came back, donned headphones and gloves,
3488980	3493940	turned up some outlaw country and began to clean the scene.
3493940	3495460	Inside one of the duffel bags,
3495460	3497500	Clark found cleaning supplies
3497500	3500900	and three clean city PD uniforms.
3500900	3504620	Clark, John, and Keith cleaned themselves and suited up.
3504620	3507500	Leon pulled papers from Bruce's desk
3507500	3511860	and stamped them with a copy of Bruce's signature.
3511860	3515460	These papers signed Bruce's share of bar corp
3515460	3519180	over to the mill on the other side of the city.
3519180	3522380	Among Bruce's things, John found a note.
3522380	3526820	It read, she broke me open and all new things
3526820	3530740	have the power to escort change in the future of good
3530740	3534020	in order to break the cycle and find fulfillment
3534020	3536060	in an unquestioning goodness
3536100	3538140	that breaks the relentless tether
3538140	3542500	holding this lie of a world withstanding itself.
3542500	3544540	I can smell my past.
3544540	3546420	I can hear my future.
3546420	3547980	I am joy.
3547980	3549780	I am destruction.
3549780	3551540	I am pure.
3551540	3554300	Death to Myriad.
3554300	3556300	811-818-9520-131181119.
3562020	3564380	They recognized the number from Bruce's house
3564380	3566980	and finally broke the cipher.
3566980	3570460	They found the numbers spelled Harriet Marks,
3570460	3573340	a name they hadn't come across.
3573340	3576740	Clark received a text on the mysterious burner phone
3576740	3580220	that read, the book your parents died for
3580220	3584980	is still hidden in an undisclosed location.
3584980	3587540	He texted back, what book?
3587540	3588620	Where?
3588620	3591060	A quick search for Harriet Marks revealed
3591060	3593500	she was a pro-union activist
3593500	3596380	studying at City State University
3596380	3598500	who committed suicide in her dorm room
3598500	3601980	just four days before on December 2nd.
3601980	3604340	Leon said they would go investigate her
3604340	3605980	after they cleaned up.
3605980	3609740	The group heard sirens and made a run for Leon's car.
3609740	3613380	After a destructive chase and a lethal getaway,
3613380	3616700	Keith noticed Clark and John zoning out
3616700	3619140	muttering the number sequence.
3619140	3621100	Keith described to Leon what happened
3621100	3622380	in Bruce Robin's office
3622380	3624980	and what they'd worked out about the cipher.
3624980	3628220	Leon showed Keith a picture of the inside
3628220	3630420	of Harriet Marks's dorm room.
3630420	3634540	Spray painted all over the walls was a third sequence.
3634540	3639540	1522518195518, the code for overseer.
3642500	3644820	Leon evangelized.
3644820	3647500	Clark is more than a man.
3647500	3649020	He's a God.
3649860	3651740	He's the savior.
3651740	3655740	A prophecy maintains Clark will go back in time
3655740	3659180	and found the circle of knowledge.
3659180	3662860	John and Clark came to in a parking lot on CSU campus
3662860	3665700	with Leon and Keith staring at them.
3665700	3668500	Keith informed them they had just been chanting
3668500	3670300	Bruce Robin's numbers.
3670300	3673620	Then he handed them the folder Leon had given him.
3673620	3677060	Inside were pictures of a crime scene in a dorm room.
3677060	3680180	Numbers were spray painted on every surface.
3680180	3683860	In the cipher, it read overseer.
3683860	3686660	Clark bluntly asked Leon if he believed
3686660	3689060	Clark was the overseer and was met
3689060	3691380	with an equally blunt yes.
3691380	3692900	Leon went on.
3692900	3696620	He believed Clark would eventually go back in time
3696620	3699500	and found the circle of knowledge.
3699500	3701820	The contention officers informed Leon
3701820	3705260	that an old Clark had been poking and prodding
3705260	3706820	at their lives recently.
3706820	3711060	Leon seemed curious and asked them to explain further.
3711060	3714260	They recalled the time old Clark warned Drew
3714260	3715700	something terrible would happen
3715700	3717980	before the chief's house exploded
3717980	3720620	and how old Clark had branded names
3720620	3723460	into their skin with magic.
3723460	3725660	Leon proposed the group split up.
3725660	3727820	John and Keith could head to the dorm room.
3727820	3730860	He and Clark would go to the administration building.
3730860	3734340	Leon explained while they're not sure what it is,
3734380	3737780	it seemed to transfer from person to person.
3737780	3740740	Bruce Robin got it from Harriet Marks
3740740	3744300	and Harriet Marks got it from the overseer
3744300	3746460	based on the numbers in her dorm room.
3746460	3749500	They needed to know why Clark had done this.
3749500	3751300	Clark reminded them it's not him
3751300	3752660	they're talking about exactly,
3752660	3755140	so maybe they could call old Clark Clarkold
3755140	3756980	to avoid confusion.
3756980	3760100	With that, the groups split off.
3760100	3763620	Leon began to drive away with Clark in the back seat
3763660	3766220	and Clark noticed Leon reached for a gun
3766220	3767900	that looked like the tranquilizer gun
3767900	3770980	he'd given Clark to coerce agent Trent Chad.
3770980	3773940	Before Leon could fire, Clark kicked the back of his seat
3773940	3777260	and a tranq dart stuck in the ceiling of the car.
3777260	3778600	After a short struggle,
3778600	3781260	Clark wrestled the gun away from Leon.
3781260	3786100	He held the gun to the back of Leon's head with a strong,
3786100	3788620	what the fuck?
3788620	3791580	Leon explained he had hoped to knock Clark out.
3791580	3793480	He was terrified something would happen to Clark
3794300	3795140	like a stray bullet.
3795140	3799480	If Clark died, that could mean the world ends.
3799480	3802960	Leon felt he needed to protect Clark at all costs,
3802960	3806520	but Clark argued if he really was the overseer
3806520	3809600	and he did go back to found the circle of knowledge,
3809600	3811560	then this must all work out.
3811560	3814200	In fact, he might be bulletproof now.
3814200	3816640	In a pretty threatening tone,
3816640	3820080	Clark reminded Leon he might be the one needing protection
3820120	3823240	as he didn't recall an old Leon
3823240	3826600	running around as Clark Old's right-hand man.
3826600	3828740	Leon replied with a sigh.
3828740	3830460	He said it was time.
3830460	3833900	They really needed to go to calm, comfy campground,
3833900	3836720	but Leon had been coerced.
3836720	3839860	First, they could put Clark's invincibility theory
3839860	3843600	to the test and finish out the investigation at CSU.
3843600	3846460	So Leon Simpson swung the car back around
3846460	3848580	and headed to the administration building
3848580	3850500	they'd first set out for
3850500	3853860	before the failed kidnapping attempt.
3853860	3856620	John and Keith walked through the holiday decoration
3856620	3861620	riddled CSU campus to gifts house, Harriet Marks dormitory.
3862140	3864860	The lobby was dark and vacant.
3864860	3867380	John hopped on the computer behind the front desk
3867380	3870320	and the desktop background was a promotional flyer
3870320	3873940	for the Jingle Ball scheduled for that evening,
3873940	3876500	December 6th at CSU.
3876540	3879500	The poster read, follow the scavenger hunt
3879500	3882980	to make your way to the Jingle Ball.
3882980	3885300	On the computer, John found the directory
3885300	3889300	and discovered Harriet Marks and her roommate, Amelia Locke
3889300	3893660	lived in 328 across the hall from a show dorm
3893660	3896600	for tours to prospective students.
3896600	3898340	They called the elevator and the light
3898340	3901060	that emanated from the open doors
3901060	3904140	revealed countless unique number sequences
3904140	3908300	scribbled all over the walls and floor of this building
3908300	3913300	in materials ranging from spray paint to bodily fluids.
3913500	3918140	And inside the elevator, the limp corpse of a student
3918140	3920380	was slumped over itself.
3920380	3925020	Her face was amorphous, smashed repeatedly
3925020	3927800	until she was unrecognizable.
3929100	3930780	Back in the administration building
3930780	3933500	the campus seemed absolutely empty.
3933500	3935940	It looked like Christmas itself had thrown up
3935940	3939460	the decorations that adorned everything in sight.
3939460	3941980	The lights of the administration building were off
3941980	3945380	but down the hall stood two figures.
3945380	3949140	One mumbled a sequence of letters and numbers interrupted
3949140	3953780	by desperate appeals requesting physical violence.
3953780	3957060	In their city PD uniforms, the pair approached
3957060	3960840	under the guise of officers looking for the records office.
3961720	3965320	In the elevator, John Lee Pettymore began to mumble
3965320	3967560	and pulled a Sharpie from his pocket.
3967560	3969720	He put the marker to the elevator wall
3969720	3973440	and wrote the familiar cipher of Bruce Robin.
3973440	3977000	The third floor was similarly dark and silent
3977000	3980280	and the doors to both 328 gifts house
3980280	3983840	and the show dorm room across the hall were open.
3983840	3986660	The show dorm room was covered in numbers
3986660	3989360	like every other surface in this building.
3989440	3992360	And there was an out of place Casio keyboard
3992360	3994900	in the middle of the room with a sheet of music
3994900	3995940	on the stand.
3995940	3998040	However, instead of notes on the staff
3998040	4001240	the sheet music is made of little cartoon pictures,
4001240	4006000	seven eggs, a golf ball, a cat, a demon and another egg.
4006000	4007960	Keith pushed on a few of the keys
4007960	4009800	and the electronic piano was set
4009800	4012520	to make the sound of jingle bells.
4012520	4015160	Keith put the silly sheet music in his pocket
4015160	4018320	and continued investigating the display dorm.
4018320	4022520	A window looked out on the overly festive campus.
4022520	4027080	In the middle of the quad was a large old bell tower.
4027080	4030760	Keith ignored that and found a flyer for the jingle ball
4030760	4033320	and written on the back was a math equation.
4033320	4037040	The solution to this problem was 330,
4037040	4039040	the number of the room in which he stood.
4039040	4041380	Keith ignored that and headed across the hall
4041380	4045040	to Harriet Marks's room with the mumbling John in tow.
4045040	4048520	In 328 Gift's house, Keith found trophies
4048520	4053240	for riddle solving competitions on the desk of Amelia Locke,
4053240	4057320	a desk which clearly lacked a laptop.
4057320	4060440	The charging cord and various USB accoutrement
4060440	4065440	wreathed a rectangular negative space on its surface.
4065480	4069640	On scrap paper, Keith found a handwritten note from Amelia
4069640	4073420	that outlined her views on the suicide of her roommate.
4073420	4076860	She clearly did not believe Harriet was suicidal
4076860	4079180	and she wrote she had a plan to figure out
4079180	4080820	what actually happened.
4080820	4082580	Keith went through Harriet's things
4082580	4085700	and found a tucked away sticky note
4085700	4088440	with a two point to do list.
4088440	4093440	The first, research most unethical corporation in the city.
4094580	4098580	The second, who is the overseer?
4099440	4101620	Clark and Leon approached the two figures
4101620	4103860	in the hall outside the admin office.
4103860	4105780	A short and slight freshman jumped up
4105780	4108940	and poked a tall, well-dressed student with perfect hair.
4108940	4111420	The little one begged to be hit
4111420	4113980	and the tall one calmly declined.
4113980	4116620	Defeated, the short dude ran to a wall,
4116620	4119180	slammed his head against it and yelled
4119180	4122860	that doing it himself just wasn't the same.
4122860	4124880	Clark and Leon approached and the tall student
4124880	4127980	calmly asked for a moment as he stared up
4127980	4131580	at a banner above the office window that read,
4132420	4134380	at the end of the 10th day,
4134380	4138740	my true love had given me blank gifts.
4138740	4140600	Leon ignored the scene entirely
4140600	4143260	and entered the unlocked administration office.
4143260	4147820	The crazed, small student requested pain from Clark
4147820	4150420	who asked why the kid would wanna be hit so badly.
4150420	4152620	The student said he would love it
4152620	4156420	and then suddenly started to spout some numbers off.
4156420	4158120	Clark asked about the numbers.
4158120	4162000	The student didn't recall saying any numbers.
4162000	4165680	Clark hit him and he crumpled the floor in delight
4165680	4169120	before scampering off into the darkness.
4169120	4171320	Clark asked if the tall, calm student
4171320	4173920	was thinking of numbers at all.
4173920	4174840	He said no.
4174840	4178120	Leon reiterated the question and flipped on the lights
4178120	4180440	which revealed countless numbers
4180440	4183220	covering the walls of the hall.
4183220	4185800	The tall student affirmed he didn't even know
4185800	4187240	the numbers were there
4187240	4191860	and he introduced himself as Donovan West Haven.
4191860	4193760	Donovan West something explained
4193760	4196680	he was just trying to work out the riddle on the banner.
4196680	4199280	After some debate about how to solve
4199280	4200920	the gift counting riddle,
4200920	4205140	Clark and Leon agreed to investigate the office instead.
4205140	4208180	The single computer was password protected.
4208180	4211880	On the desk sat pictures of a woman in her early 20s
4211880	4214440	holding trophies for scavenger hunts.
4214440	4217760	The name on the trophies, Amelia Locke.
4217760	4220560	There was also a photo of a group of students
4220560	4225480	holding up a banner that said Best R.A. Gifts House.
4225480	4227600	Clark suggested their best bet
4227600	4229820	would be to head to Locke's dorm.
4229820	4231540	Donovan asked if he could tag along.
4231540	4235560	He would, after all, need help solving the other riddles.
4235560	4236720	On the way to Gifts House,
4236720	4239840	they could hear strange whoops and hollers
4239840	4243400	from unseen people all over campus.
4243400	4246280	Inside Gifts House, the lights were out.
4246280	4248520	Clark motioned for Leon to investigate
4248520	4250000	the receptionist's computer
4250000	4254920	while Clark hollered a hello down the empty hall.
4254920	4257400	Donovan wandered into a smaller hallway
4257400	4259560	and lights suddenly came on.
4259560	4262880	Numbers covered everything and from behind a door
4262880	4266880	at the end of this hall came a desperate no, no, no,
4268460	4271800	followed by a sequence of numbers.
4271800	4274520	The door cracked slightly
4274520	4278480	and a voice very creepily reached out.
4278480	4282840	Please turn out the lights.
4282840	4286920	Donovan obliged and slowly backed out of the hallway
4286920	4291920	and a genuine thank you oozed from the room.
4293800	4296760	Clark warned Donovan that if he heard numbers like that,
4296760	4299360	he might want to close his ears.
4299360	4301360	But Clark still wasn't sure how exactly
4301880	4303800	this thing spread so he went to ask Leon,
4303800	4306220	who'd already put on noise canceling headphones.
4306220	4307880	Clark tapped him on the shoulder
4307880	4309840	and Leon tapped the computer screen
4309840	4312760	that showed the room number of Amelia Locke
4312760	4316380	and her roommate, Harriet Marks.
4316380	4318800	When asked, Donovan said people
4318800	4321880	had been shouting numbers at him constantly.
4321880	4324220	Clark wondered if he'd had any blackouts
4324220	4326840	or gabs in his memory but Donovan replied no,
4326840	4328800	he felt pretty good actually.
4328800	4331120	Clark pondered aloud whether Donovan
4331120	4334120	might be the thing they were looking for.
4334120	4337760	It seemed like he could be immune.
4337760	4340960	The trio headed up to Amelia and Harriet's room
4340960	4342800	on the third floor.
4342800	4347200	Clark Bishop, Leon Simpson and Donovan Westerfuck
4347200	4349240	approached 328 Giff's house
4349240	4351260	and found John and Keith already there.
4351260	4353320	John snapped out of a haze as they entered
4353320	4357880	and mumbled something about being able to do anything.
4357880	4360800	Keith explained they'd come across a dead body
4360800	4362740	in the elevator when John went blank
4362740	4365400	and started writing the Bruce Robin numbers.
4365400	4367780	Clark asked John if he remembered writing the numbers
4367780	4372780	and John asked Clark if he had ever felt quote, immense.
4373240	4375440	Clark introduced Donovan to John and Keith
4375440	4378060	and revealed there was a chance Donovan was the key
4378060	4381800	to all this, that he might be immune to the numbers.
4381800	4383960	John walked directly into a wall
4384000	4388400	and confessed he was still working out the kinks.
4388400	4390980	The reconvened team put their heads together
4390980	4395400	on the riddle from the banner and came up with 330.
4395400	4397960	The room across the hall where Keith already found
4397960	4400840	a piece of paper that depicted illustrations
4400840	4404360	of seven eggs, a golf ball, a cat, a demon
4404360	4407680	and another egg set upon a music staff
4407680	4409800	atop a Casio keyboard.
4409840	4414000	Keith then presented the to-do list from Harriet's desk.
4414000	4418160	One, research the most unethical corporation in the city.
4418160	4421040	Two, who is the overseer?
4421040	4423760	He also had a note from Amelia's desk
4423760	4425640	where she wrote she didn't believe Harriet
4425640	4428400	would commit suicide and she was going to get
4428400	4430080	to the bottom of it.
4430080	4433160	They hit the first letters of each cartoon
4433160	4435900	as notes on the Casio keyboard.
4435900	4438120	It's the melody of Jingle Bells
4438120	4441520	and out the window of 330 Gift's house
4441520	4444320	they watched the bell tower in the center
4444320	4449320	of the CSU campus light up in all its holiday glory.
4451680	4454160	This not so subtle clue led the party
4454160	4456500	to a pleasant stroll through campus,
4456500	4461040	admiring the crisp white snow, festive decorations
4461040	4463560	and constant screaming on their way
4463560	4466160	to the lit old bell tower.
4466160	4469760	They climbed the spiral staircase behind Keith
4469760	4472000	who warned them to close their eyes
4472000	4476260	to not look at the corpse of an almost retired security guard
4476260	4477900	some of them listened.
4477900	4480540	The interior of the bell tower and the corpse
4480540	4482900	were also covered in numbers.
4482900	4485800	At the top of the tower they met an attractive young woman
4485800	4489260	named ShamWow Chameleon who recited the numbers
4489260	4492840	for Harriet Marks as she desperately tried
4492840	4495480	to get onto the roof of the tower.
4495480	4499400	Keith saw a sleigh lit up across the way
4499400	4501520	which indicated the Jingle Ball
4501520	4504800	was in the Accord Student Center.
4504800	4506840	John accidentally let slip to Leon
4506840	4511320	that at least some of them might possibly also be ball.
4511320	4514440	Keith and John helped ShamWow out of the bell tower
4514440	4518280	and onto the roof and the group headed off across campus
4518280	4520920	to go to the Jingle Ball.
4520920	4524800	On the journey a path of colorful string lights
4524800	4529240	led to a sitting area which contained a ripe corpse
4529240	4533800	and a frantic dancer who pointed to the student union.
4533800	4536000	They entered the Accord Student Center
4536000	4539320	on the middle floor of a three story atrium
4539320	4541880	filled with the pure chaos
4541880	4545440	of wholly obsessive students and faculty.
4545440	4549880	On their level a girl shaved a team of live reindeer
4549880	4554520	with a blunt knife and glued the fur to herself.
4555080	4558200	On the floor below a pair of muscular young men
4558200	4561480	in Santa outfits diligently wrapped a student
4561480	4565320	in wrapping paper with duct tape and force.
4565320	4568200	Above an older woman in a bathrobe
4568200	4572560	and an aviator hat climbed a garland to the top floor.
4572560	4575480	A huge disco ball and a Santa hat
4575480	4578440	hung from the middle of the domed ceiling.
4578440	4581440	On the lower level a naked man used a mop
4581440	4585080	and bucket full of paint to write out numbers.
4585080	4589480	An ice skating rink contained three people dressed as elves.
4589480	4592440	They placed carrots in various locations
4592440	4596760	on a life size snowman model and laughed hysterically.
4596760	4600600	A young woman in a t-shirt that identified her
4600600	4605240	as a gifts house RA threw a laptop in the air
4605240	4608680	over and over again while spinning around.
4608680	4612200	A man doing squats on top of Santa's throne
4612200	4614280	suddenly stopped.
4614280	4617800	He looked out, wild eyed and screamed,
4617800	4622000	Tawil alagool, Tawil alagool.
4622000	4624920	John with the power in his mind
4624920	4627680	commanded the chanting man to stop.
4627680	4629680	Unfortunately to no avail.
4629680	4631600	Keith shot the guy and he collapsed
4631600	4633240	into the Santa Claus throne.
4633240	4636760	However, he was not dead and continued to chant.
4636760	4639360	The gunshot grabbed the attention of the assembly
4639360	4643000	in the atrium and they changed their behaviors.
4643000	4646840	The woman with the fur sharpened the reindeer's antlers.
4646840	4649040	The Santa twins wrapped each other
4649040	4650800	instead of the other students.
4650800	4653200	The ascending woman climbed faster.
4653200	4655360	The elves took off their skates
4655360	4657560	and the girl with the laptop threw it
4657560	4659800	even higher than before.
4659800	4662520	John accidentally shot two reindeer.
4662520	4665040	Clark ran toward the laptop girl.
4665040	4668440	Keith shot one of the Santa twins to death.
4668440	4672760	Leon gave Donovan a gun and escorted him to a safe spot.
4672760	4676840	Suddenly, the frenzied throng froze
4676840	4679320	and began the chants.
4679320	4681960	The man in Santa's chair jumped
4681960	4686080	and impaled himself on the post of the throne.
4686080	4690240	The laptop landed on the side of the spinning woman's head
4690240	4692200	and knocked her out cold.
4692200	4693640	Clark grabbed the laptop
4693640	4697160	and checked the unconscious RA's vitals.
4697160	4701040	As the rest of the deranged chanting party
4701040	4705840	executed their elaborate and festive suicides,
4705840	4710840	Emilia Locke took her last breath in Clark's arms.
4712120	4714800	The atrium of the Accord Student Center
4714800	4718960	was a suddenly still disgusting mess.
4718960	4722480	The PA crossfaded out of the classic mashup
4722480	4726040	of Wonderful Christmastime by Sir Paul McCartney
4726040	4728520	and Grown Up by Danny Brown,
4728520	4732400	replaced by a horrifying rendition of Santa Baby
4732400	4734480	by Tyler the Creator.
4734480	4738520	John and Clark fell back into their unnatural malaise
4738520	4741360	and scrawled the numbers for Bruce Robin
4741360	4744720	all over whatever mess they sat in.
4744720	4747040	Leon Simpson, for the first time,
4747080	4750760	fell to the ground to write out a sequence of numbers.
4750760	4752800	Donovan was still conscious and present,
4752800	4754800	but absolutely shook.
4754800	4758240	Keith solved Leon Simpson's new cipher,
4758240	4760520	the solve Ben Smith,
4760520	4763840	who Keith recognized after a quick Google search
4763840	4766560	happened to be the corpse nearest,
4766560	4770960	the now dazed member of the circle of knowledge.
4770960	4773120	Still the only team member up in Adam,
4773120	4775600	Keith opened Emilia Locke's laptop.
4775680	4777120	He found screenshots
4777120	4780400	from the CSU Biology Department Twitter account.
4780400	4781920	The first read,
4781920	4784080	a few of us who are not infected
4784080	4785760	are quarantined in the lab.
4785760	4787520	Please call 911.
4787520	4789760	Our calls are not going through.
4789760	4791880	The second was in all caps.
4791880	4795680	Call 911, CSU campus infected with a virus.
4795680	4797320	Please help, we are trapped.
4797320	4799520	Call 911.
4799520	4802080	And the final tweet pleaded.
4802080	4804720	We're still quarantined in the lab.
4804720	4808760	If you are the person or entity scrubbing this page,
4808760	4810480	please have a heart.
4810480	4813240	We are running low on supplies.
4813240	4814920	There were also two videos
4814920	4817720	and small windows open on the desktop.
4817720	4821360	One showed Harriet Marks sitting in her dorm room.
4821360	4824600	The other was a dark and distorted picture
4824600	4828480	with only a lit candle in frame.
4828480	4830920	Clark and John snapped back to reality,
4830920	4832920	but Leon Simpson began dancing
4832920	4835200	like his life depended on it.
4835200	4837000	Keith showed Clark the laptop,
4837000	4838800	but Clark was far more interested
4838800	4841000	in the glow than the content.
4841000	4844040	Leon's phone went off and he continued to boogie down
4844040	4846280	with no concern for his surroundings.
4846280	4847240	Due to his groove,
4847240	4850600	the buzzing flip phone popped out of Simpson's trousers.
4850600	4852400	Clark grabbed it for the glow,
4852400	4854720	but noticed 25 missed calls
4854720	4857240	and an interesting text thread.
4857240	4859840	Responding to, how's it going?
4859840	4863360	Leon sent, the secretary is stubborn,
4863360	4865760	looking for another option.
4865760	4868080	That was the last outgoing message,
4868080	4871560	but there was a barrage of words from the other side.
4871560	4875840	In short stabs, they wrote, I don't want excuses, pick up.
4875840	4877280	Okay, I sent them.
4877280	4880200	T.O. will be ready for extraction.
4880200	4883440	Don't forget to get the signatures.
4883440	4888440	E.T.A., question mark, Jesus Christ, what is going on?
4889200	4891320	Question mark, question mark, question mark,
4891320	4894080	before the longer final message.
4894080	4898240	If he doesn't get here in time, this is all over.
4898240	4901800	Everything we've worked for, everything that exists,
4901800	4903880	just gone, for what?
4903880	4905840	Your fucking conscience?
4905840	4909440	Morality won't save us.
4909440	4912400	They all assumed it was Maggie on the other end,
4912400	4916320	so Clark responded, hey, it's Clark.
4916320	4918720	Donovan led the group to Glass Hall,
4918720	4920960	which housed the biology lab.
4920960	4924600	Clark received a text on his mysterious burner.
4924600	4926840	He had asked, what book, where?
4926840	4929800	And this message read, your book.
4929800	4932280	Calm, comfy campground.
4932280	4934960	Leon's phone also received a text.
4934960	4938000	It said, fuck, what did you do?
4938000	4941040	From both phones, Clark Bishop sent the question,
4941040	4942560	who is this?
4942560	4946680	And on both phones, he got the same response.
4946680	4948160	Destiny.
4948160	4950440	The walk across campus was soundtracked
4950440	4953000	by a cacophony of guttural moans,
4953000	4956480	which danced on the cold December winds.
4956480	4959440	In the quad, they saw ShamWow Chameleon
4959440	4963440	as she steadied herself on the sanctified minion blow up
4963440	4968240	atop the bell tower and screamed about getting even higher.
4968240	4971680	In the far distance, the chopping of helicopter blades
4971680	4975360	slowly but surely grew louder and louder.
4975360	4978360	Given the option between a longer lit path
4978360	4980360	and a shorter one in darkness,
4980360	4983320	Clark persuaded the group to stay in the light.
4983320	4987040	Around a well-lit corner, an old man moaned
4987040	4990560	and took a citrus peeler to his frail fingers.
4990560	4993760	Keith saw this horror and lost it again.
4993760	4995360	The group, sans vigna,
4995360	4997880	deciphered this old man's number sequence
4997880	5000720	and learned the name belonged to a coworker
5000720	5004840	who hanged himself in front of this bloody mad old-timer.
5004840	5007960	They continued on to Glass Hall Keith came to
5007960	5012960	and they found a child meticulously sticking syringes
5013800	5018560	into a somehow unmoving student's eyeballs.
5018560	5020080	With that, John and Keith
5020080	5022440	were lost in their numbers once again.
5022440	5025760	Inside Glass Hall, the sounds of a few deranged folk
5025760	5028200	bounced and echoed through the halls.
5028200	5032040	A trail of blood slowly dripped down the stairwell
5032040	5035600	which had a few bloody screwdrivers scattered about.
5035600	5039680	On their way down the wet, sticky stairs to the biology lab,
5039680	5041840	Keith Vigna tripped, fell,
5041840	5044720	and knocked something loose in his head.
5044720	5046440	He popped up ecstatic
5046440	5049720	and grabbed what he thought were handfuls of cash
5049720	5054320	but were, in reality, handfuls of bloody screwdrivers.
5054320	5056880	He stuffed them into all of his pockets
5056920	5060120	and, for good measure, pulled a few out of a woman's corpse
5060120	5063880	while he smiled and yelled they were rich.
5063880	5067800	Keith Vigna then crammed his finger deep into his nose
5067800	5070960	and sniffed with all of his lungs.
5073480	5077960	Eyes wide, he shoved his finger into Clark Bishop's nose
5077960	5082960	who did not expect a heaping bump of pure cocaine.
5082960	5085360	Clark immediately went blank,
5085360	5088720	but instead of numbers, he chanted,
5088720	5091360	Ta will alico.
5091360	5093640	In the basement of Glass Hall,
5093640	5097720	the team stood just outside of the biology lab.
5097720	5100440	Keith Vigna collected bloody screwdrivers
5100440	5102400	he thought were cash.
5102400	5105320	John Lee Pettymore talked down to everyone
5105320	5107280	like a god might.
5107280	5110360	Donovan Wester-something-or-other panicked.
5110360	5115240	Leon Simpson boogied and Clark Bishop chanted.
5115240	5118840	The lights went out and the red emergency lights activated.
5118840	5121600	An ominous glow illuminated the party
5121600	5125240	as the entrance of Glass Hall burst open.
5125240	5126600	Orders were shouted.
5126600	5128960	Crazed voices were silenced.
5128960	5133080	Clark grabbed one of Keith's dripping screwdrivers.
5133080	5136480	A small canister was tossed down the stairs
5136480	5140320	and a thick gas came pouring out of it.
5140320	5143440	Clark sharpened his screwdriver.
5143440	5145680	Keith and Donovan rushed into the lab.
5145680	5147240	Leon danced.
5147240	5151200	Down the stairs stormed a squad in tactical gear.
5151200	5154240	They shouted and tossed more gas canisters.
5154240	5158360	Clark jammed the sharpened screwdriver into his eye
5158360	5162320	until the handle was flush with his socket.
5162320	5165240	Blood dripped down his face
5165240	5169120	and Clark Bishop crumpled to the ground,
5169160	5171400	limp and lifeless.
5173280	5177080	John stared at the scene, began chanting
5177080	5179560	and ran into the lab.
5180640	5183400	Inside, a man and a woman in lab coats
5183400	5186000	sat turned away at a desk.
5186000	5187840	The woman greeted the group and asked
5187840	5190360	if they knew how to fix the situation.
5190360	5192800	Back in the hallway, Leon started chanting
5192800	5196600	and fell to the ground, surrounded by the tactical squad.
5196600	5199240	John aimed his gun at the door
5199240	5201760	and waited for the incursion.
5201760	5203960	Barbara, the woman in the lab coat,
5203960	5207160	insisted that she and Phillip were just fine,
5207160	5209560	much like Donovan Whateverhaven.
5209560	5214480	She asked Phillip to explain, but he didn't move.
5214480	5217640	Donovan, worried he might be the only sane person
5217640	5220920	left on Earth, looked to John for help,
5220920	5224880	but John was turning his firearm on himself.
5224880	5227920	So, Jonathan fired at John to try to disable him
5227920	5230120	from committing suicide, but he missed
5230120	5234800	and sent a bullet right into the CSU biology department's
5234800	5238920	prized anti-virus machine.
5238920	5241360	Barbara turned Phillip's chair around
5241360	5243640	so he could see this madness,
5243640	5248280	but Phillip held his own eyeballs in his hands
5248280	5252200	and dried blood covered his face below
5252200	5254800	his empty eye sockets.
5254800	5257480	The raid from the tactical squad began.
5257480	5258960	Smoke filled the lab.
5258960	5261800	John looked around the room and smiled.
5261800	5265440	Finally at peace, John Lee Pettymore the third
5265440	5267680	shot himself in the head.
5267680	5271320	Keith prepared for a showdown and Donovan went to his knees,
5271320	5273360	submitted and asked for help.
5273360	5275480	One of the infiltrating squad members
5275480	5277800	placed an oxygen mask on Donovan
5277800	5279840	and he immediately fell asleep,
5279840	5283160	but high on disillusion and cocaine,
5283200	5285960	Keith Vigna murdered two of the troops
5285960	5288080	with bloody screwdrivers
5288080	5291600	before they eventually ended his life.
5293760	5297160	Through the haze and red emergency lights,
5297160	5301960	we see the two casualties of Keith's screwdrivers,
5301960	5305360	lifeless in pools of their own blood.
5305360	5307240	The camera leaves the lab,
5307240	5311360	passes the elderly pile of a corpse in the hallway,
5311360	5314440	moves up the stairs and out of glass hall.
5314440	5317600	The CSU campus is humming.
5317600	5319480	Sirens are constant.
5319480	5323600	Limp bodies are being transported by teams of two
5323600	5325480	in full tactical gear
5325480	5329720	and dragged into prison transport buses.
5329720	5334040	The sky is littered with unmarked black helicopters.
5334040	5338320	We see one hovering above the minion atop the bell tower,
5338320	5343320	a rope ladder allowing ShamWow Chameleon to get even higher.
5343360	5345440	As we leave the CSU campus,
5345440	5348400	we see a confluence of black SUVs
5348400	5350800	heading toward one of the taller buildings
5350800	5352520	of the city skyline,
5352520	5355720	a building that is being climbed
5355720	5360040	by something massive and spherical.
5360040	5362440	We continue past the business district
5362440	5365320	and swoop down into the back of a van
5365320	5367480	heading out toward the pier.
5367480	5372480	The broken and upgraded and dead and metal corpses
5372840	5375480	of John Lee Pettymore and Keith Vigna
5375480	5379040	are jostling around the posterior of this van
5379040	5382760	that pulls up to a grand old edifice,
5382760	5385320	alone on the edge of the water
5385320	5388520	with a well-lit sign outside that reads,
5388520	5390720	The City Asylum.
5390720	5393840	Inside the front doors are two familiar guards,
5393840	5396440	tall and overweight and all black
5396440	5399120	with prominent facial scarring.
5399120	5401360	After we move down through the floor,
5401360	5403760	we are immediately looking through
5403760	5407400	a long line of the bottoms of feet.
5407400	5410320	Body after body has been laid out in a row
5410320	5413400	covered in sheets, feet sticking out.
5413400	5416920	We stop on the final four soles.
5416920	5418880	Both right feet are blank.
5418880	5421480	Both left feet have dead skin
5421480	5423960	in the shape of the circle of knowledge,
5423960	5427520	but one left foot has the name Maggie
5427520	5430920	burned on top of the seven circles.
5430920	5434040	Our vision moves up through the ceiling
5434040	5437360	and into a small dark room.
5437360	5442160	Donovan Westhaven wakes up to the sounds of beeps
5442160	5447160	and bloops of a machine that you feel yourself connected to
5448480	5452160	and you're laying in a hospital bed
5452200	5456000	in a room that is completely dark
5456000	5459120	except for the lights coming from the machine
5459120	5461200	on either side of you.
5461200	5464080	You see that your blood is being drawn
5464080	5466880	and there is an IV in your other arm
5466880	5469160	and then a screen turns on,
5469160	5472560	a freeze frame of like a webcam video
5472560	5477560	and it's Harriet Marks and she is mid-chant.
5477880	5482800	Allacle, towel, allacle, towel, allacle, towel, allacle.
5482800	5487800	Towel, allacle, towel, allacle, towel, allacle.
5488920	5493920	Towel, allacle, towel, allacle, towel, allacle, towel.
5496000	5499040	And then you see at the bottom of the screen,
5499040	5504040	the barrel of a gun comes up and she squeezes the trigger
5505040	5509000	and then she with a splatter of blood behind her
5509000	5511760	falls back and out of frame of the camera
5511760	5513960	and you're just looking at her dorm room
5513960	5516880	with a paint of blood behind her
5516880	5520680	on the wall and on the ceiling and then the video stops.
5521680	5524360	And a man comes out of the darkness
5524360	5526280	in the back corner of the room
5526280	5529680	and you can see that he's lit by your machines
5529680	5533160	and he's wearing a black suit with a black tie
5533480	5534440	and a white shirt.
5535560	5539680	I need you to tell me everything that happened.
5544160	5545280	Okay.
5545280	5550280	What's up everybody?
5560760	5562360	I just wanna drop in here real quick
5562360	5565760	to shout out two absolutely indispensable folks
5565760	5569640	from over on the Discord who have made this tiresome task
5569640	5572560	about 10 times less interminable feeling.
5572560	5574320	First, I Shot Marvin.
5574320	5578400	I Shot Marvin wrote up recaps for six episodes.
5578400	5580800	They have earned a shirt.
5580800	5582880	And second, Here Be Tigers.
5582880	5585080	Here Be Tigers got a name check last time
5585080	5587680	because they not only wrote four recaps
5587680	5590640	but their recaps were super well done.
5590640	5593920	Well, they added five more episodes this time around
5593920	5597480	bringing their total to nine fucking recaps.
5597480	5600560	Thank you so, so, so much.
5600560	5603480	You have so clearly and obviously earned yourself
5603480	5606320	an elusive PTBP T-shirt.

5676200	5678960	I'm so stupid stoked.
5678960	5682400	We are dumb grateful for all of you sharing
5682400	5684360	in our absurd story.
5684360	5689120	In the delicious words of John Raymond Ray Arnold,
5689120	5692040	chief engineer of Jurassic Park,
5692040	5693520	hold on to your butts.
5693520	5716840	How am I the only one trying to pull off
5716840	5723080	how can you have enough drowning out
5723080	5727840	of all who knows?
5727840	5731840	There's no one home.
5731840	5735840	No one home.
5735840	5739840	No one home.
5739840	5744200	Fly, fly, to the stream you know.
