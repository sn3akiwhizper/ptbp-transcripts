1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Hello, my little weirdos.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,920
It's your giant father, Wolf the Dog.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,680
And I'm here to embrace you freaky little dudes.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:15,440
Society may reject you, but your great mother wolf never shall.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,120
You provide your ears, your minds, your energies.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,240
And I provide you with the greatest radio show this side of the Polaris.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,840
And I am shipping out auditory waves live from 694.2 PTBP.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,720
The only radio station that lets little weirdos like you

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,360
write in things that I am contractually obligated to read.

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,240
Speaking of, this edition of Howlin' with Wolf comes from Liddy in the City,

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,160
who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,000
The third best thing you can do with them thumbs.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,160
Liddy in the City writes,

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,680
Hey Wolf, thanks for all the rippin' songs.

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,840
Altagirl is keepin' my grip strong as I move along.

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,240
Swiftly through this shitty city.

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,320
But I long to be strong.

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,680
To no longer be a pawn who keeps calm.

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,600
I want the full throttle.

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,960
No doddle logical like Aristotle.

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,040
Light the rag in this bottle.

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,400
Fuck Fred Godel.

23
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,760
Well, thanks, Liddy in the City.

24
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,840
There was an awful lot of rhymin' in this Howlin' with Wolf.

25
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,800
Is this that slam poetry I've heard so much about?

26
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,680
Now you did a good job, Liddy in the City.

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,960
I would snap my fingers in appreciation.

28
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:48,240
But unfortunately, the grease prevents any friction between any of my body parts.

29
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,080
If you want to write up something for your loving wolf to howl,

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,280
tag at Pretending Pod on your social media accounts

31
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,120
and let your friends know that you're an absolute weirdo.

32
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,880
If they're your friends, they're probably pretty strange too.

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,240
And if you want to have that sort of conversation in public,

34
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,400
go to PretendingPod.shop

35
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,440
and grab a hat that says PTBP

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,080
or a super rad fanny pack

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,360
with a four-panel cartoon of What Went Down at Splashylvania on it.

38
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,520
You'll have a new group of freaks to hang out with in no time.

39
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,640
Don't go out?

40
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,000
You can take this game to a high score situation

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,880
by posting pics of your hot new PTBP merch online

42
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,040
from the comfort and safety of your mobile device.

43
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,040
The options are endless.

44
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,000
And the links are in the show notes.

45
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,800
S-E-G-U-E

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,720
S-E-G-U-E

47
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,480
S-E-G-U-E

48
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,640
And yes, this is a segue.

49
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,320
It's time for the news.

50
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,520
Last time,

51
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,160
Julius ran back into Grover's Gorge

52
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,800
to get away from the wet energy

53
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,920
that erupted out of Chuck Bidwell's body

54
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,800
when it landed in the unnatural chasm,

55
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,240
exploded through the stained glass of the church

56
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,760
that stuck upside down in the smooth crevasse,

57
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,960
and everyone else was knocked unconscious.

58
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,360
The conscious can field producer found Fox Gottel

59
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,280
and brought him back to the rest of the can crew with a plan.

60
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,640
As they came to, Julius asked Stevie,

61
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,280
as the eldest Gottel in the area,

62
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,040
to declare Fox the new mayor of Grover's Gorge.

63
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,440
No one expected it to work,

64
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,880
but that sloppy god came bursting back out

65
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,040
through the colorful church windows

66
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,160
and launched Fox Gottel into the air like a video game KO.

67
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,360
Let's have a toon take us to the action.

68
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,840
Here's an oldie, but a goodie.

69
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,520
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

70
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:34,560
High School Musical.

71
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:34,800
Yeah.

72
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,560
High School Musical 2.

73
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,640
Is there a second one?

74
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,480
Oh, aren't there like five or six?

75
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,920
What would the second one be called?

76
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,960
College Musical.

77
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,280
College.

78
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,000
And the third one?

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,120
30-Year-Old Musical.

80
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,160
Internship Musical.

81
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,640
And they're now making a fourth one.

82
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,600
I think that's the only series that happens in high school.

83
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,400
Yeah.

84
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,120
If I said Pleasantville was the scene.

85
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,080
Orgasm.

86
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,680
Yeah.

87
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,960
I haven't seen Pleasantville since...

88
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,960
Maybe ever.

89
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,760
Since I was a kid.

90
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,320
That scene?

91
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,760
Yeah.

92
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,840
Is that the one where things become color?

93
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,160
Yeah.

94
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,360
Nice.

95
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,880
Sinful.

96
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,680
Because of it.

97
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,880
Because of cum-een.

98
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,160
The scene where they drive into the park

99
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,560
and the cherry blossoms are floating over the car

100
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,880
and Edda James, at last, is playing is like...

101
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,240
I didn't jerk off to that one.

102
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,800
Cinema bliss.

103
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,200
You were saying though, it's...

104
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,120
It's a good scene.

105
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,120
There's also...

106
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,160
He's describing what the world outside of Pleasantville is like

107
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,240
and Dave Brubeck's Take 5

108
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,800
starts just kind of slowly coming in in the background.

109
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,760
It's such a cool scene.

110
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,800
Y'all watching Andor?

111
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,320
You watch that Andor?

112
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,480
I'm not caught up, but I've seen...

113
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,080
I think I'm just like one behind.

114
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,640
Cool.

115
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,560
If you're out there and you can hear my voice

116
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,960
and you have Disney Plus.

117
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,760
Or a friend you can rope in to giving you their login.

118
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,080
Yep.

119
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,200
Just rope them.

120
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,720
Just rope them right on up to their homestead.

121
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,840
Just rope them.

122
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,800
Lasso them and don't let them go until they tell you that Disney logo.

123
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,000
Hoe time.

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,760
And then watch Andor.

125
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,240
Yeah.

126
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,640
It's so good.

127
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,240
It's so good.

128
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,200
It's real good.

129
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,760
It's good.

130
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,400
It's good.

131
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Like watch it.

132
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,560
If you're listening, watch it.

133
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,160
Because I want more of it.

134
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,600
Me too.

135
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,560
But I've tried to have this conversation a few times in real life.

136
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,760
Oh, well don't do that.

137
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,280
Just say it where people can't talk back.

138
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,200
No, no, no.

139
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,880
Nobody ever talks back.

140
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,840
It's just that they're like,

141
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,960
Oh, yeah, that sounds nice for you.

142
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,560
No one ever talks back.

143
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,200
Exactly.

144
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,360
I'm glad, nerd.

145
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,200
Good for you.

146
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,440
You have a gritty Star Wars.

147
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:41,760
Wow.

148
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,120
Now a gritty Star Wars.

149
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,920
I'd be interested.

150
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,240
It's set on Kashyyyk.

151
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,880
Yes.

152
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,160
Philadelphia Kashyyyk.

153
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,360
Oh, my God.

154
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,400
I don't know.

155
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,840
Watch the shit out of that.

156
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,960
The day it came out.

157
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,480
Gritty is probably the kind of thing that might get old for other people,

158
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,560
but I will enjoy until the day I die.

159
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,280
I think it's just the right time for me to grow old and always be delighted for it.

160
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,160
And my kids will be like,

161
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,120
Yeah, everything's a gritty.

162
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,120
Like there's mascots that kill each other now and say the F word.

163
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,440
Gritty fucking sucks.

164
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,960
And I'm like, nah, gritty is delightful.

165
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,400
Everything's a gritty is incredible.

166
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,760
I like when he wiggles his tummy.

167
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,200
It's pretty good.

168
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,320
Speaking of gritty, we all look a little grittier now, don't we, boys?

169
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,640
Do you mean the can crew?

170
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,240
No, I mean, well, the king crew definitely fucking works pretty gritty.

171
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,840
Or do you mean us after two and a half years of a pandemic?

172
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,520
What else did we do that might make us like different women?

173
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,120
We were all gritty for Halloween.

174
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,680
That's right.

175
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,200
We were all gritty for Halloween.

176
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,640
No, but we should have done that.

177
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,440
Gritty gang.

178
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,960
Oh, oh, yeah.

179
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,360
Aren't we a little bit more gritty guys?

180
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,080
You're right.

181
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,280
We got tat week.

182
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,800
We all got sick tats.

183
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,680
Sick tats.

184
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,160
Dude, we got sick tats.

185
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,880
I was sick tat like best ever.

186
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,840
Hey, can you believe it?

187
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,480
Four white guys got a tattoo to commemorate their podcast.

188
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,600
Four guys who like would have never had skulls tattooed on them.

189
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,480
Likely.

190
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,000
No, no.

191
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,960
That was kind of the beauty for me is that I think I would have gotten a skull.

192
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,560
It just happened to be our podcast logo.

193
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,440
Oh, hell yeah.

194
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,640
I might get more skulls of different styles.

195
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,080
Not in like a crazy.

196
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,800
You should just get the same skull all over.

197
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,400
I should know.

198
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,840
I'm just, yeah, Luke's right.

199
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,600
I'm just going to get the PTPB skull.

200
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,760
One for every man you've killed.

201
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah.

202
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,880
Perhaps.

203
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,120
Three.

204
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,600
Said that really quick.

205
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,800
He said that really quick.

206
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,760
You don't forget them.

207
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,640
Well, I never do.

208
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,280
It's good.

209
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,440
I think if you don't, I guess.

210
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,320
Is that better?

211
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,960
What do you think?

212
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,360
Is it better to remember those that you've murdered?

213
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,400
You gotta leave the past behind.

214
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh, well, I would like to get into this episode by asking you guys how you feel.

215
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,320
We're on episode 16 of season two.

216
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,280
We're like getting into the weeds of this thing.

217
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,280
Shit is popping off.

218
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,120
Shit is popping off.

219
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,880
What is going through your mind?

220
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,480
What were we doing in episode 16 of season one?

221
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,600
That's a good question.

222
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,400
Just for some, like, you know, some sort of reference.

223
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:34,240
Episode 16 of season one was titled like father, like surrogate son.

224
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,920
So it was the second of three flashback episodes.

225
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,480
Oh yeah.

226
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,440
This is the one where John Lee Pettymore's racing past and injury is explored.

227
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,600
The episode notes say John Lee Pettymore's past is explored.

228
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,000
Rules are ignored.

229
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,680
The officers check out the house of the Lord.

230
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,280
So we go to the church and you eat their pasta salad or whatever it was?

231
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,080
Yeah, no, I eat some of it and then I put it back.

232
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,280
It's so weird.

233
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,120
The time dilation that makes me think that that was so much later in the season and it's

234
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,400
only episode 16.

235
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,800
See, so now do you, how do you feel about being in episode 16 of season two?

236
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,320
I think we can do this one faster.

237
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,680
It feels like it's moving faster to me, but I don't know how it feels to you guys.

238
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,720
Yeah, I think so.

239
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,600
Listening back to the first season, I guess I know everything, but it's like...

240
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,680
Let's try to go into spoilers on season one.

241
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,280
I know we talked about eating food and that's pretty intense, but...

242
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:31,920
You're right.

243
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,600
So without any spoilers, without any spoilers, I'm just like...

244
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,480
With no incident.

245
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,440
I was just like, oh, we should have, we should have figured out some more of this.

246
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,960
This time around, how do you feel?

247
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,080
Do you feel like you're getting the information, the lore?

248
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,720
Do you feel like you have an understanding of what's going on?

249
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,160
We nailed that God total shit.

250
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,400
Yeah, we're all over this.

251
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,720
So you're saying there's no need to theorize?

252
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,320
No, I know exactly what's happening.

253
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,720
We can skip to the end and summarize the mystery if you want us to.

254
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,320
It's real easy.

255
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,720
There was a God turtle and through the decades, it became Godel.

256
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,880
And it wants to...

257
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,680
Turn everyone into a church.

258
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,840
So like we said, Zach, we're all over it.

259
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,220
Perfect.

260
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,360
Well, then I think it's time to hop on in and we're going to start with Thomas.

261
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,400
Dive on in.

262
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,000
You, I believe, broke yourself.

263
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,320
Sorry, I am doing a season one re-listen.

264
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,920
We're also, we just played.

265
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,800
Oh yeah, we just played.

266
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,200
The last thing we played was our character, our season one character.

267
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,440
Yeah.

268
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,560
And by the time you hear this episode, you can go to patreon.com slash pretending pod

269
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,480
and check out.

270
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,120
Well, maybe by the time you listen to this episode,

271
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,880
It's not this Friday, but next Friday.

272
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,240
During this month, the month that this episode comes out, you'll be able to hear John Lee

273
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,440
Pettymore, Clark Bishop, and Keith Vigna.

274
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,360
Oh, I'm so sorry.

275
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,160
Doing what?

276
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,280
We trick or treated.

277
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,680
We smell my feet.

278
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,360
We got us something good to eat it.

279
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,320
Perfect.

280
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,640
So you can go to patreon.com slash pretending.

281
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,400
And listen to it's the butter finger bandit, Keith beans.

282
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,200
But for now I need Mr. Jotaro.

283
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,560
Mation motion picture.

284
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,280
Dr. Luke Kinteman, please remove your headphones.

285
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,120
I brought my Bluetooth headphones like Thomas did last episode.

286
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,600
Now I don't have to wiggle my fingers in my ears.

287
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,540
Thomas.

288
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,000
This season, season two, we are choosing our own, so it's kind of up to us to decide

289
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,320
whatever your mania phobia weird character hiccup is.

290
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,360
So what was it that happened when you broke?

291
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,400
What did you see?

292
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,520
Well, that's the deal, Zach.

293
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,320
I don't really know.

294
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,760
You told me it was an Olympic pool sized fluid amount of wet energy.

295
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,320
Yeah.

296
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,120
Wet energy.

297
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,520
Big wet energy or a little wet energy?

298
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,440
I clearly yeah.

299
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,080
Olympic.

300
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,400
Okay.

301
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,600
So are you afraid of people who look like they might be Olympians?

302
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,560
Yeah.

303
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,400
My only, the only way this affects me is that I have a distaste from Michael Phelps.

304
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,360
You're really, you want to become a swimmer more than anything in the world.

305
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,400
That's quite a coincidence.

306
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,440
You would notice, of course, the cow is pretty fit for his age.

307
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,000
And one of the ways he keeps that up, what?

308
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,880
I saw that dance.

309
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,440
Oh, right.

310
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,080
Exactly.

311
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,880
So he couldn't run anymore because of his bad left knee, but he took up swimming and

312
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,120
every year for the past 20 years, he has done, um, whatever, whatever a healthy amount of

313
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,520
laps.

314
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,680
I don't know what a good amount of laps across an Olympic swimming pool is.

315
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,320
I would say like for me, one, one and a half, if I could get to the second side, that'd

316
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,080
be best for living.

317
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,720
Yeah.

318
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,320
You don't want to stop halfway through.

319
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:00,800
Nope.

320
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,080
Unless you're close to the edge.

321
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,640
That's right.

322
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,000
Cal Colorado does a more than healthy amount of laps for a man of his age for a man of

323
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,200
10 or 15 years younger.

324
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,040
Perhaps.

325
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,800
And he may not realize it standing here right now looking at this thing.

326
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,600
Well, it's already like past and in Fox Godel who is like splayed out on the ground over

327
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,080
by the plant wall, seemingly wet.

328
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,800
He doesn't like it that he doesn't like it at all.

329
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,760
And the next time he might, who knows if he stops himself as he walks out the door, go

330
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,160
into the pool or if he gets to the edge and reaches in and like starts to dive in.

331
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,720
Sure.

332
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,800
So we're going to say that it's specifically because you noticed that it was the size of

333
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,720
the pool and I think it's, I think it's going to be large bodies, large bodies of water.

334
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,520
And maybe, maybe some, maybe some water in general, but mostly large masses.

335
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,320
Whatever you do, man.

336
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,520
All right, let's bird them boys.

337
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,400
The last thing you guys saw, the last thing I saw was God.

338
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,640
So the end of the last episode, it's hairy as far as what we can listen to, but I think

339
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,680
I'm frozen in shock at my moment in time.

340
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:12,560
Absolutely frozen in shock as you're looking down, which means that you see first

341
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:22,640
this energy, this enormous wet energy that you've seen before, almost pouring out of

342
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,560
this church building that you see in the bottom of this unnatural chasm in this valley.

343
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:35,680
It is filling it up in the bottom and then it is flying up out toward you over the cliff.

344
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:42,480
Luke, Julia Summers sees the same sort of wet energy you've noticed before fling itself

345
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,480
and the two of you see this time exactly like last time, just crashes.

346
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:58,720
This time into Fox Godel, throwing her backwards, flying out towards the plant wall and he lands

347
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,760
with a thud.

348
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:06,560
The wet that has been surrounding and around and just pushes itself in and around him almost

349
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:13,920
seems to dissipate into nothingness as you see a soaking wet Fox Godel laying unconscious

350
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,280
on the ground.

351
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,400
I need Beck Wilder and Julia Summers to roll grip.

352
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,400
Thomas, you rolled last time.

353
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,080
At the end of the last episode.

354
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,640
I pass.

355
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,600
I don't.

356
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:34,480
When you pass, you're still going to lose one grip due to the enormity of this situation

357
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,400
and because you've seen it before, this kind of impacts your opinion of the last time you

358
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,920
saw this happen, right?

359
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,440
You almost expected it halfway through, but then it's all of a sudden over.

360
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,160
You slightly see the same result and Julia Summers, I need you to roll a d4 and add one.

361
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,360
That's a three plus one, which gets me to my breaking point.

362
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,560
Oh, second breaking point of season two.

363
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,560
Julia Summers, where are you at grip wise?

364
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,440
I'm at 36.

365
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,360
What did you start with?

366
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,120
What's your power power?

367
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,680
60.

368
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,160
Dang.

369
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,600
You're almost halfway through the grip that you had the tethered to the world in which

370
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,840
you lived is almost halfway gone.

371
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,600
That's not great.

372
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,880
You roll with what you get and you roll what you get.

373
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,240
In that case, let's hit you with this breaking point right now.

374
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
Joe Thomas, headphones babies.

375
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,760
I'm going back to Katy Perry.

376
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,360
Is that what you're guitar soloing to?

377
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,320
Was my last one that I don't like running water?

378
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,120
Yeah, that's right.

379
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,640
So what are we going to do this time?

380
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,560
We have a similar situation that brought you to this point, but you've seen a lot.

381
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,400
You've had a lot happen to you.

382
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:53,600
You're currently like face half broken, barely like the bones barely holding themselves

383
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,240
together.

384
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:00,240
Every time you like move quickly, you kind of feel the ajarness within the skeleton of

385
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,960
your face.

386
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,680
Owie.

387
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,720
Owie, owie, dude.

388
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,560
That is not good.

389
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,840
I'm trying to think what would make sense here.

390
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,160
Okay.

391
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,120
So we've got heights as a situation here.

392
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:19,040
We have the cane that hit your face repeatedly that brought you to this point.

393
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,080
It's the most physical pain you've ever been in your life, I would assume.

394
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,320
Yeah.

395
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,480
Closest he's ever been to dying for sure.

396
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,040
Yeah.

397
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,040
So I think maybe doing something with your face is a fine idea.

398
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,040
Doing something with heights is a fine idea.

399
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,440
Doing something else with water is a fine idea.

400
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,800
What if because of this injury, I don't recognize my face?

401
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,300
Whoa.

402
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,560
But it's like, not feel somehow trapped in a body that is not my own.

403
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,520
Fascinating.

404
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,520
Do you feel comfortable playing that?

405
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,000
Sure.

406
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,640
Fuck yeah.

407
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,520
That's scary.

408
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:51,840
Right.

409
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,120
I think not until he sees his reflection.

410
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,680
That's right.

411
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,320
That's right.

412
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:56,720
Okay.

413
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,760
Sounds good, man.

414
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,320
All right, cool.

415
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,280
Let's burn him back.

416
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,160
Okay, cool.

417
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,600
Thomas, what were you listening to?

418
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,720
The new Beths album.

419
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,800
Ooh, love them.

420
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,440
Me too.

421
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,320
The new Beths.

422
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,200
Frozen solid.

423
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,880
Beck Wilder cannot even move his face.

424
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,760
You just hear the thrust and out of the corner of your eye, you see Fox Gottel flying out

425
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,880
of eye shot.

426
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,360
Nailed it.

427
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,440
What?

428
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,120
Why?

429
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,720
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

430
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,880
And Stevie is trying to hold back the vomit that seems to be coming.

431
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,400
Oh, and she cannot hold.

432
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,880
She starts blowing.

433
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,480
Oh no, you're going to make me throw up now.

434
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:58,320
I swallowed it.

435
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:05,120
Falls to her hands and knees and Fox Gottel laying on his back completely unconscious,

436
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:11,600
wearing a monochromatic gray scale jumpsuit leisure wear with green accents like he's

437
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:18,240
been dancing in the AR goggles have literally landed in the place where he was just standing

438
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,960
at least, god, I don't even know, like 36.8 feet away.

439
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,400
He's just like vanished?

440
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,320
No, he is on the ground over by the plant wall on his back, unconscious and wet.

441
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,480
And you see him wearing those clothes.

442
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,400
I want to, I guess, pick up the goggles.

443
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,200
Yeah, when you pick them up, you see that he's been kicking Julius Summers' ass

444
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,880
in a ring collecting game.

445
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,120
Julius, what have you been engaging in leisurely video games on working hours?

446
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:57,280
Julius is like just with his goggles still on, just staring down at his feet and like

447
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,040
finally just pulls the headset off and you can see he's been like sobbing.

448
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,360
Well, I was going to joke about you losing, but now

449
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,160
the headset just kind of falls to the ground and he's like,

450
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,040
when you look at it on the ground, what do you see?

451
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:14,560
Julius sees his own reflection in the visor, the visor goggles.

452
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:20,000
And he just starts kind of like looking and like squeezing his face and like scratching his face.

453
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,920
When the two of you see him scratching in his face and feeling it away,

454
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:30,720
like you see some of the cartilage is like pushing out of his skin as he's playing with it.

455
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,080
Cow Colorado vomits.

456
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,580
Gross.

457
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,760
Oh, Thomas, you're going to make me.

458
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,260
Oh no.

459
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,320
People are going to complain that they actually vomited.

460
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,200
I was going to say that is a trigger for some people pretty hard.

461
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,960
Am I jumping out of freeze mode?

462
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,680
Yeah. Where do you want to?

463
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,720
Not yet.

464
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,360
The two of you look over and see Beck Wilder has not moved a muscle.

465
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,840
Stevie has run over at this point and crawled over on her hands and knees.

466
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,040
And they're just like over their brother's body, touching the face, holding the head up.

467
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,240
Fox, Fox.

468
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,880
Stevie, what the hell was that?

469
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,720
I guess it worked.

470
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,600
It worked.

471
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,360
She's just nodding to Julius.

472
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,720
What, what happened?

473
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:21,920
Well, we've Fox, uh, became the mayor and now he holds God.

474
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:27,040
We it let's try to maintain some journalistic, uh, standards here.

475
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,760
We cannot confirm or deny that that is God.

476
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,360
Well, the, the turtle spirit isn't right.

477
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,720
Let's hope Beck got that.

478
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:41,520
You look over and you see the camera is pointed directly at the opening in the stained glass.

479
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,160
Of this church upside down in Godel's feet.

480
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,840
Canyon crevasse.

481
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,680
As, as we walk over Cal and maybe a rare moment of like opportunistic solidarity with Julius

482
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,400
is like, it looks like you might've got a pretty good angle with that.

483
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,560
I sure hope so.

484
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,200
Fingers crossed.

485
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,600
Right.

486
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,040
And we get over there and I'm,

487
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:07,200
I want to get an alertness check real quick from both Julius Summers and Cal Colorado.

488
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,280
Pass 32 on a 40.

489
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,360
Pass nine on whatever.

490
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,440
11.

491
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,600
It's not the sound of dogs.

492
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:18,960
Oh, good.

493
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:35,440
You know, from the door, but it is the sound of doors opening large doors, not ones that

494
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,120
need to be dogged, but not dog doors.

495
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,280
Undog doors are opening train doors.

496
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,240
Large large creaking doors.

497
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,760
Church doors.

498
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,040
Oh, that's a church door.

499
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,280
That is the creepiest kind of door you can open.

500
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:58,080
And the sound echoes through this area plant wall on either side.

501
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,440
It's the sound just kind of bounces back and forth.

502
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,000
You all see figures exiting the church going up.

503
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:13,120
Seemingly that fog that rose and formed the penetrable wall previously has dissipated.

504
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:19,920
There must be like steps coming up from the church because these bobbing people is this

505
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:26,080
massive folk that you see just very, very tiny off in the distance are making their

506
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,360
way up the unnaturally smooth wall.

507
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,640
Somehow maybe steps, maybe some sort of pathway.

508
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,160
Must be steps or a pathway.

509
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,440
Are they on our side?

510
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:42,960
They're climbing up your side out of the deep alien crevasse and toward the shelf that

511
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,400
you all stand on.

512
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,520
Uh, back back, back.

513
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,960
Are you seeing, are you seeing this buddy?

514
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,920
We got a frozen.

515
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,960
The camera won't move.

516
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,000
Cal is alarm.

517
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,760
He starts shaking you, but like by the shoulder back back, snap out of it.

518
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,120
Cal, Cal.

519
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,240
He slaps you.

520
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:10,720
Sorry.

521
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,920
Delayed reaction.

522
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,560
My dad.

523
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:18,960
Oh God.

524
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,720
Oh, Cal dude.

525
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,920
I saw it.

526
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,240
It's I saw it.

527
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,960
Who, who, who, who are they?

528
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,120
And I'm pointing at the figures.

529
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,520
I mean, when Beck sees figures, he points the camera at figures.

530
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:42,480
And as he zooms in on this roving gang heading up, you see how many figures are we talking

531
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:42,800
here?

532
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,640
We are talking nine figures.

533
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,040
Okay.

534
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,000
Oh, 10 figures.

535
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,800
One is just nope to 11, but two are just closer to the ground.

536
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,640
Seemingly a billion.

537
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,040
And as you zoom in, you see a gaggle.

538
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,080
That's 10 figures.

539
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,640
Nice.

540
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,040
Don't worry.

541
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,160
They're just geese.

542
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,280
They're school children.

543
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,880
Do they look ghosty or like, are they like ethereal?

544
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,360
No, they're wearing school uniforms.

545
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:13,120
And as you guys are looking into the viewfinder of Beck's camera to watch and see these people

546
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,800
head up in the back of the group, you see the last school child wearing the same uniform

547
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:26,560
is like on all fours, like on their knuckles and their toes.

548
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,440
The next boy, he is just a normal kid.

549
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,040
Let's see if that's even stranger for some reason.

550
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,680
I don't like that one.

551
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,360
He gives me the creeps in particular.

552
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,480
There's like seemingly six normal looking ones.

553
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,000
It's still quite from a distance.

554
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,560
You can't zoom in that far, but they seem to be wearing school uniforms.

555
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,160
However, in the back you see, it's like they've got red.

556
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,400
Yeah.

557
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,840
There's like a bit too much red around on all of them as they come closer to the top.

558
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,640
Stevie, what do you think of this?

559
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,680
Toward your shelf.

560
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,720
Red just around them?

561
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:00,880
Yeah.

562
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,040
You're not just going to keep talking about it while they keep climbing.

563
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,280
On their clothes.

564
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,200
We get to do something about this.

565
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,680
And as they all freeze, I'll continue to describe the rest of them.

566
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:19,760
No one makes a step, but in the back you see this human body with a face of a pug dog.

567
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:25,200
As you look down, it's got sharpened claws that are holding onto a leash.

568
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,920
And this human body is wearing a school uniform.

569
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,280
And on the leash, there is just a jaguar.

570
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:31,920
Cool.

571
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,400
The cat.

572
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,000
The cat.

573
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:43,280
And in the back is a kangaroo walking up on its hind legs with a very human gait to its walk.

574
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:49,440
It is wearing the school uniform as it follows up the rear as they make it closer to the top.

575
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,880
And you zoom in.

576
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,720
You see that they have blood on their hands, on their faces, and on their uniforms.

577
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,200
Jesus.

578
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,800
Stevie, are these the 20s?

579
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,880
I need you all to roll grip.

580
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,280
Damn.

581
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,800
Glad I had that in my notes.

582
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,800
I do not pass.

583
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,920
I do not pass.

584
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,680
I do pass with a 14.

585
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,160
In order to decide whether you lose zero grip or one grip, I want you to explain this to me.

586
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,080
Why I don't lose sanity?

587
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,320
Yeah.

588
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,120
I got nothing.

589
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,360
I don't...

590
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,240
Okay.

591
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:22,880
Lose one grip.

592
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,600
I'll lose one, yeah.

593
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,240
How much if you fail?

594
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,320
The frame wobbles just a minute as it loses a little composure and gets it right back.

595
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,320
Let's hit it with a D4 plus one for the two of you.

596
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,000
That is four more for me.

597
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,240
Oh, shit.

598
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:46,240
Four grip down for Julius, and you are now halfway between your starting power and zero grip.

599
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,120
Not quite.

600
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,680
Oh, no?

601
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,240
32.

602
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,720
Oh, damn.

603
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,200
My bad.

604
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,840
That is five more for Cal Colorado.

605
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,280
Whoa.

606
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:53,780
Damn.

607
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,360
God damn.

608
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,600
Is that a flight, flight or freeze?

609
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,720
That's a flying, flying ring.

610
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,520
You guys are acting like you've never seen animal children before.

611
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,840
It's like Kangaroo Jack.

612
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,360
Beck, I don't know what's going on with me, but I'd ask you to shut the fuck up.

613
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:18,960
Stevie also failed the grip, and they're freaking out, but not because of what you see.

614
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:26,000
You just hear sobs and wailing from behind you as kind of the realization of what this

615
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,760
all means sets in.

616
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,640
Stevie's sobs?

617
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,720
Stevie is sobbing from behind you.

618
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,320
Their brother probably basically isn't really real anymore.

619
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,760
Yeah, I don't know what to make of that.

620
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,120
Is he still unconscious?

621
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,760
He is, yeah.

622
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,320
If you can look back for even half a second and take your eyes off the situation at hand,

623
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,000
you would see that he's still on the ground.

624
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,280
Julius, he sees the animals and stuff and is just like, nope.

625
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,960
And he just goes over and just is like looking at Fox.

626
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,120
He's like, I got to look at something that's not going to be that.

627
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,400
No, it's just not fair.

628
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,800
It's just not fair.

629
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,920
Julius bends down and ties Fox's shoes together and then looks at Stevie in case he tries

630
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,920
to walk off the ledge like Chuck.

631
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,720
As she's just sobbing and nods.

632
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,360
Thomas, let's go to you.

633
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,240
Cal just lost five grip and so he had to roll for fight, flight, or freeze.

634
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,040
Nice.

635
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,440
I chose a fight as the least likely.

636
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,640
It doesn't even make sense in this situation.

637
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,960
I would be that horrified.

638
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:44,160
Followed by flight, followed by freeze, and I rolled flight.

639
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:50,240
So Cal also just turns his back on this and he's like, you're filming this, you got this.

640
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,360
Looks like you got a good frame there.

641
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:01,600
I'm going to go see how Julius and the others are doing.

642
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,440
Just shout if you need anything.

643
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,560
You've already been way far away from me at this point.

644
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,800
He's slowly walking and talking.

645
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:18,480
Beck, you see in the background, the single simple steel train car and the single simple

646
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,760
steel train car sized simple steel car train station.

647
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,080
Say that five times fast.

648
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,800
And you see Fox got on the ground and Stevie hands and knees over him and Julius standing

649
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,680
kind of hunched over next to Stevie and Cal backing up toward them.

650
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:43,120
I want to zoom in on a face or two of these animal people walking up the stairs.

651
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,480
What are they focused on?

652
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,760
Are they looking at us?

653
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,840
Are they maybe zombie-like?

654
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,120
They are not zombie-like.

655
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,480
And they're not walking up stairs.

656
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,480
What do you think is happening, Thomas?

657
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,960
Oh, I thought they were just like climbing the wall, right?

658
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,240
I thought it was like ghost stairs that they were walking up.

659
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,920
I thought, yeah, I don't know.

660
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,280
I think it's ghost stairs because you said the kangaroo had a human walk.

661
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,720
It did have a gate, yeah.

662
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,640
As it goes straight up the wall.

663
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,160
So what do they seem to be focused on?

664
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,540
You.

665
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:24,800
Dudes, I don't know like the protocol with like meeting a new species and like how we're

666
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:29,040
supposed to like do that from like a scientific perspective, but they've got blood on their

667
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,600
hands and I think we got to get the fuck out of here, dudes.

668
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,100
Zoinks.

669
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:37,780
Um, hearing Beck freak out, but then also describe basically what he's seeing.

670
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:41,460
Julius snaps back in and he knows that we have to get this on film.

671
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,620
I mean, that's the one thing that's being handled.

672
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,780
Julius whips around and just goes, Beck, don't stop filming.

673
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,380
Oh yeah, I'm filming, dude.

674
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,860
We got to, we got to talk to him.

675
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,660
No, no, no, no.

676
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,940
I agree with Beck.

677
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,660
We need to get back to our mystery machine immediately.

678
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,340
And I think we need to take Stevie and God.

679
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,300
Let's fucking go.

680
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:08,580
Yeah.

681
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,900
Stevie, we got to take your God brother in our van with us.

682
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,300
Fine.

683
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,100
Let's go.

684
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:12,660
Into the train.

685
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,460
Into the train, dudes.

686
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:18,740
Uh, I, Julius helps Stevie, I guess just carry Fox into the train.

687
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:26,340
Your hands as the, uh, as you grab on to the, uh, the legs of Fox Godel.

688
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,540
And I need you to roll grip.

689
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:28,740
Is it like.

690
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,140
It's wet enough to where water runs.

691
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,460
But I'm not like squishing into his body.

692
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,460
You're not squishing into his body like Jell-O.

693
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:41,380
No, but the water that is coming out of his clothing squishes and rolls over your hands.

694
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:50,340
And as you don't pass, you drop Fox Godel as you lose one grip and you cannot pick him back up.

695
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,180
That makes a pretty good sound.

696
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,260
Oh, yeah.

697
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:58,980
Julius catches a glimpse of himself and some of the water that's like reflecting

698
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,420
up and just starts picking at his face again and runs to the train.

699
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,140
Boom.

700
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,500
First one in.

701
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,700
Julius Summers.

702
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:10,580
Cal Cal looks at what he must now do, which is pick up this wet Fox.

703
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,900
And he is terrified.

704
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,940
He, he kind of like, he looks at the wet pant leg.

705
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,340
He looks back at the twenties.

706
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,620
He looks back at the pant leg and he completely shutters.

707
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,340
And he goes, and he picks it.

708
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:30,980
He picks the leg up or tries to go ahead and roll.

709
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,700
I pass seven.

710
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,380
It takes a huge sigh and like, let's go out.

711
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,220
He feels the water running out.

712
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,180
He knows where it's from.

713
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:48,260
And he just, he sighs and closes his eyes and he's like, Stevie, if you could just lead the way,

714
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:52,100
I'm going to look over to the side here and just let's walk straight.

715
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,740
Walk straight.

716
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,060
Okay.

717
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,860
Quickly, quickly.

718
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,100
All right.

719
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:54,500
Yes.

720
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,220
Yes.

721
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:55,620
Beck.

722
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,420
Come on Beckworth.

723
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,260
The news mate waits for no one.

724
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:02,740
Beck is trying to keep the camera focused on the animal creature.

725
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:06,500
People coming up the stairs, but he is backing it into the train.

726
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:13,140
As you back up into the train, you see them crest over the shelf, over this cliff side.

727
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:17,460
And they are on the same plane as the can crew.

728
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:23,300
And they are staring barrel down, eyes straight into the camera.

729
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,460
All of them as they begin running.

730
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,900
Oh no, fast zombies.

731
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,420
I was going to give them a friendly way of hoping,

732
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,100
hoping maybe they would just kind of give me a nice wave back.

733
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,620
What do you do as you're halfway,

734
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:42,100
like halfway into a friendly wave as they start sprinting towards you?

735
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,700
Yeah, his arm is up about to give like a very hardy,

736
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,620
hello there kind of wave.

737
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,540
And when he sees them start sprinting,

738
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:54,900
he uses the wave to grab the top doorframe of the train car

739
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,220
and throw himself backwards into the train car

740
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,060
and hope that the door closes behind him.

741
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,860
Good job Beck.

742
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,660
Keep filming.

743
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,100
Julius says as he's looking out the window, but also at his reflection.

744
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,540
Beck is yelling,

745
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,980
Train, train, go.

746
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,420
Make train, make train move.

747
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,260
Move train, train, train move.

748
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:14,980
Oh, oh, oh.

749
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,780
Cal throws the last of the lasagna out of his pocket.

750
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,020
Oh, those animals are going to love that.

751
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,100
Yeah, hopefully.

752
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:24,600
Yes.

753
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,140
Hopefully one's a cat.

754
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,700
The TV screens mounted on both the front and the rear of this train car,

755
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,580
these modern flat screens flicker to life.

756
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,940
You see a blank white soundstage with a white stool

757
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:42,340
and a man walks into frame, sits on the stool and smiles at you all, the viewers.

758
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,260
Hello, I'm Fred Gaudel.

759
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:49,140
He's a soft looking man in his later 60s with a loose plumpness and glasses

760
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,220
that consistently look like they're about to fall off his nose.

761
00:36:53,220 --> 00:37:01,220
And the group of bloody school children with animal compatriots runs closer to you all.

762
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,980
Has the door closed?

763
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,460
Nope.

764
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,420
Beck runs up to the screen, is trying to tap the edge like it's a touch screen.

765
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,100
Fast forward, fast forward, fast forward, fast forward.

766
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:08,420
We got it.

767
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:08,660
We got it.

768
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:08,980
Hi, Fred.

769
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,460
Hey, Fred.

770
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,020
We're going.

771
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,980
We're finally Fred.

772
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,940
Can we do anything here?

773
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:18,420
Let's go ahead and get a roll for like electronics from Beck Wilder.

774
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,020
Do you have some sort of...

775
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,220
I think I got some.

776
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,860
I got computer science.

777
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,500
Yeah, there we go.

778
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,180
The look you just gave me.

779
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:28,740
What is it?

780
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,860
You want to see what I rolled?

781
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,260
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

782
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,700
That's a critical fail.

783
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,540
Are you fucking kidding me?

784
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,100
99.

785
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,780
That's a 99.

786
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:40,660
Hey, Beck, what do you do to the TV, man?

787
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,940
I guess I'd smash it.

788
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:50,500
In my frantic tappings, tappings turn to fist pounding, fist pounding turns to all outrage

789
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,060
to try and get this fucking train going.

790
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,660
Like David Ortiz at a telephone.

791
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:00,980
Can any of you come up with a reason why I should get this train going?

792
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,580
No, but I'm hoping you can.

793
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:16,100
Stevie, what do we do?

794
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,380
We have to get out and we have to run across the tracks, I guess.

795
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,420
Some of us might not make it and we might not be able to get Fox across.

796
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,660
That's going to be our most important task, okay?

797
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,660
Thank God I'm not afraid of heights.

798
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:43,060
Yes, we have to make sure that Fox doesn't fall to his death because that'll unleash

799
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,380
it again and we have to get him across.

800
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:50,100
But I guess this thing isn't going to start, so we need to get the fuck over across right

801
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,260
now.

802
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,740
What happens if you just try to like pull the door shut?

803
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,780
I guess try to pull the door shut and we'll see what happens here.

804
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,500
Do you have some sort of mechanical engineering?

805
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,780
Anyone with mechanical engineering?

806
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,740
Strength?

807
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,340
I mean, yeah, I was just going to use strength.

808
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,260
I don't have anything.

809
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,500
Okay, I could persuade the doors to close.

810
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:09,860
It could work.

811
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:13,060
It's a smart train kind of past 21 on a 50.

812
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:22,100
Okay, you pull these doors and as you pull them, you're able to get both sides shut.

813
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:27,620
Now we're going to have to roll a very important luck check here to see if that actually gets

814
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,740
the train moving.

815
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,820
Can I spend my luck on a luck roll?

816
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,180
I guess if you lose it.

817
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,580
If you need to on this luck roll.

818
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,220
I don't.

819
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:37,780
40.

820
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,460
Oh, you don't need to spend it.

821
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,940
Ah, that is a much better situation.

822
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:48,020
Should we cut out the part where I came up with a super cool idea to run across the train

823
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,340
tracks?

824
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,860
Maybe because Beck was going to say they got a fucking jaguar with him.

825
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,780
We're not going to outrun these animals.

826
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,580
There was no way.

827
00:39:54,900 --> 00:40:01,460
That's another full episode of us being picked off one by one by monsters.

828
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:07,300
One by one survival horror across train tracks above a massive 80 story gulch.

829
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:11,220
Yeah, that sounds like a good concept for the board game maybe.

830
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:19,140
As the doors shut, Julius wants to address the train as if it is Frank Godel.

831
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,540
Wait, is that their dad or grandpa?

832
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,820
I rolled luck and succeeded.

833
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:27,300
Yeah, but you know, he's talking to the train while you're getting it to work.

834
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:27,540
Right.

835
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,460
Gotcha.

836
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,860
Is this their grandpa or their dad talking?

837
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,300
The TV is Fred.

838
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:33,780
Fred.

839
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,060
Which is their dad.

840
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:35,700
That is correct.

841
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,460
And Frank is the grandpa?

842
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,340
Also correct.

843
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,620
And was there only one TV?

844
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,180
There's one in the front and one in the back.

845
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,060
So yeah, the other one continues to play.

846
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,500
He's a soft looking man.

847
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:52,500
His guy says, thank you for coming and experiencing my pride and joy.

848
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,700
Grover's gorge.

849
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,660
I'm thrilled that you came and joined me on a tour of the future.

850
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:02,260
While you leave, please think very seriously about if you'd like the outside world to mirror

851
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,740
this gorge, this little town.

852
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:09,860
Julius looks at the TV and just says, Fred, your children are on board.

853
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,420
Please go.

854
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,940
Do you want to roll to feel good about this?

855
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,700
Can I say no?

856
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,500
I got a 99.

857
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:27,960
What?

858
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,340
You said roll to feel good about this.

859
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,660
So all that happens is that he rolls.

860
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,300
Thankfully, either way, it doesn't do anything, you know?

861
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,780
I got a 96, but yeah.

862
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,460
Don't try to reason with the machine.

863
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:43,540
Fred Godel points his finger into the air and a green light comes on.

864
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:50,100
This one means I'm really looking forward to shaping the world and making it a much

865
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,140
better place.

866
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:56,500
And the single simple steel train car begins moving.

867
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,580
Hey Julius, are you filming?

868
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:03,700
And Kal, like as those things like start slapping like against the wall while we're slowly

869
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,900
pulling away, Kal starts doing the TikTok dance like in their faces.

870
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:11,140
I mean, of course Julius pulls his phone out and films that.

871
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:18,820
As soon as you start filming, the bottom of a jaguar slams onto the side of the window.

872
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:25,460
You see the bottom of its legs scraping as it suddenly disappears and it is on top of

873
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,180
this simple single steel train car.

874
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,660
We are in dexterity order.

875
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,020
Luke, what does Julius Summers do?

876
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,140
He continues to film.

877
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:40,820
You hear purring coming from above you and the footsteps traipsing across.

878
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:46,500
And as you get further away from the shore, you can look and see the group waiting on

879
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,900
the other side, standing on the shore.

880
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,260
The shore of the cliff.

881
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,100
Nailed it.

882
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,780
Wait, on the other side?

883
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,780
The side we just left?

884
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,300
Yeah, the side that you just left.

885
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,100
I'm with you, Thomas.

886
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:05,860
I thought maybe there was like another group that we were heading towards.

887
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:08,660
Well, I thought there was maybe a spatial switcheroo.

888
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,860
There's no spatial switcheroo.

889
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,060
Everything is the same on both sides.

890
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,140
There's just a leopard on top.

891
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:16,020
Okay, there's just a jaguar on top.

892
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,140
Or is it a leopard?

893
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,940
Roll biology to know if you can tell the difference.

894
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,380
Oh, that's not one of our skills.

895
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:25,940
Science.

896
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:26,420
Bitch.

897
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,860
Intelligence at a negative 20.

898
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,180
Critical success.

899
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:32,500
Oh!

900
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:34,660
Fail.

901
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,620
Julius, Julius, are you getting that jaguar?

902
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,940
I'm not going to roll because Julius would have no...

903
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:45,460
He definitely wouldn't be able to distinguish between these two things.

904
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,580
Yeah, it's really difficult.

905
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:52,180
However, Cal Colorado confidently says that into your camera.

906
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:56,900
I'm still filming him dance until the TikTok's over.

907
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:01,220
It starts playing that same animation and the voiceover is coming over

908
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:04,500
as Dexterity Order hits Beck Wilder, you're up.

909
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,500
Beck is now like a horror movie just filming the ceiling of the train car

910
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:13,620
as he follows the sound of the steps of the paws of the claws of the jaguar.

911
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:16,420
It's seemingly just prowling on top.

912
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,380
Back and forth.

913
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,180
Back and forth.

914
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,740
Dudes, like, when the train stops, we gotta like hold the door closed.

915
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,580
Hold on, that gives me an idea.

916
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,180
And Cal thinks with all his might,

917
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:30,500
oh, I want to use that critical success biology rule about jaguars

918
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,220
to interpret some feline behavior here.

919
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,900
Now we're role-playing, baby.

920
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,380
Let's interpret some feline behavior.

921
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,140
Do these windows open at all?

922
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:39,540
Yes.

923
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,900
Quick, everyone, anything shiny you have, gather it all up.

924
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,500
I mean, you guys have a ton of equipment,

925
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,820
so there's got to be something shiny in that bag.

926
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:50,100
Got the keys to the van, and Beck probably has a huge key ring of bullshit.

927
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,140
The keys to the van.

928
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:54,260
Well, I mean, like, we save the key to the van and throw the other key.

929
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:58,020
We don't have a lot of that stuff because we left it in the lockers when we came here.

930
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:58,580
Oh, fuck.

931
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,980
But it's where we're going to.

932
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:05,300
I'll use like a lens of a lens I'm not using on my camera,

933
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,380
and it can probably reflect some.

934
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,420
Yes, that's brilliant.

935
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,100
We'll use it as a giant laser pointer.

936
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,580
Oh, yeah, dude, I could focus the light through the sun.

937
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,500
Through this, and I could point it.

938
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,060
Where do you want me to open it?

939
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,740
We don't even need to open a window to do that.

940
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,060
Just point it near the tracks and see if it jumps off.

941
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:19,540
I do that.

942
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,260
I kind of aim it.

943
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,740
I'm going to aim it like where we're headed.

944
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,260
In front of it, and then, yeah.

945
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:25,780
To see if it'll run it over.

946
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,100
Beck is saying, here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

947
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:41,620
Okay, and I'd like you to roll your, like, I think you're using the same skill that you use

948
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,580
to film.

949
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,300
Yeah, I agree.

950
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,140
I thought you might.

951
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,140
That's a pass.

952
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,940
That's a six on a 80.

953
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:50,500
I failed.

954
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,220
Is it critical?

955
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,300
It is not critical, but it is a failure.

956
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,020
Catacle?

957
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,220
That cat loves this.

958
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,340
Wait, is that a 96?

959
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,300
No, it's a 36.

960
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:57,860
Oh.

961
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:58,740
Cat's not very smart.

962
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,940
And loves lasers.

963
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:06,980
And loves lasers at a massive negative percent here because of the lasers.

964
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:14,500
This jaguar jumps in front of the single simple steel train car that you are riding in.

965
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:20,980
And as the single simple steel train car continues on the tracks away from the single

966
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:24,900
simple steel train car, walking nimbly across the tracks.

967
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,420
And as it tries to make it.

968
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,540
This is not going to be good for the cat.

969
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:32,180
I'll tell you that.

970
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,140
What was it?

971
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:36,500
An 88.

972
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:44,020
As it just like crosses right in front of our path, Cal's like, I suddenly feel very

973
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:44,820
bad about this.

974
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:52,740
Julius looks at both of them and is like, I mean, that was probably a human at one point.

975
00:46:52,740 --> 00:47:00,100
As you say that, this jaguar makes a jump as it's nimbly walking across the train tracks

976
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,420
with you all approaching it.

977
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:05,540
It sees, it must make the leap now.

978
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,460
You're coming up right behind it.

979
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:13,700
It jumps for the edge knowing about how far a cliff side might be away from it.

980
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:20,900
However, its claws can normally sink in much easier to maybe a normal cliff or typical

981
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:21,780
mountain side.

982
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:27,700
However, this is an unnaturally smooth cliff side Mufasa.

983
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,900
I was about to say Mufasa.

984
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:41,300
And the single simple steeled train car lands on the other seed.

985
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:50,340
Um, I kind of wish we hadn't Mufasa'd that guy, but good, good work, Beck.

986
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,220
Well pointed.

987
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,180
It was us or him.

988
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,940
Maybe he just wanted to talk.

989
00:47:53,940 --> 00:48:04,420
The screen, the screen quickly cuts back to for Donald sitting in his green shirt and

990
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:09,220
the Godel company has continued that practice into these modern times.

991
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:16,340
So thank you for opening your eyes, opening your heart and opening your mind to a future

992
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,420
without hunger, without pain.

993
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,340
Thank you for visiting Grover's gorge.

994
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:24,900
And the doors try to open.

995
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:31,700
You hear this like noise and then they kind of stopped trying to open.

996
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:35,380
And you all remember that they've been like jammed shut.

997
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:35,860
Currently.

998
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:41,940
Are you trying to move quickly?

999
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:45,220
Like what's the, what is the feel within this train car right now?

1000
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,860
So are those people walking across the bridge or running across it?

1001
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,540
Or are they just standing on the other platform?

1002
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,380
Yeah, that's a, what do we see behind us?

1003
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:57,940
So you have windows on either side, but there's just a TV screen on the short sides.

1004
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:00,100
So then I think we're probably moving quickly.

1005
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:00,340
Yeah.

1006
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:03,620
Cause you can't see, you can't see, you could lean your head out the window and you see

1007
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:06,660
they're not, they're not trying to walk across the train tracks.

1008
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:09,380
They're uh, guys, they're just kind of standing there.

1009
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,260
It's pretty creepy.

1010
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:11,540
Actually, Beck, get a shot of this.

1011
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:14,500
I stick the camera out the window to get a good angle on it.

1012
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:21,140
They are all just staring at you standing in a line wearing their school uniforms.

1013
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,020
Bloodied.

1014
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:25,700
We're sorry about your friend, the Jaguar guy.

1015
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:26,660
He slipped.

1016
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,580
Julius is going to try to open the doors.

1017
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:30,980
Yeah, real strength.

1018
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:32,340
I'll help him out.

1019
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:34,660
I need help.

1020
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:36,420
Okay.

1021
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:39,860
Everybody Beck, you keep filming, but uh, Stevie, if you could give us a hand here.

1022
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,340
Oh, pass for me.

1023
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:42,740
Pass.

1024
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:43,060
Easy.

1025
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,620
And you're open back up to this other side.

1026
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:48,660
You see the big sign.

1027
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,740
Welcome to Godel's gate to Grover's gorge.

1028
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:56,420
You see the lockers and looking across at the other side, you see this group continuing

1029
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:58,980
to just stand and stare.

1030
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:02,500
If they're not coming for us, we should probably film a little pickup here.

1031
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,460
Julius also flips them off as he's going at the locker.

1032
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:13,860
Beck sets up the tripod and has Cal in frame with them in the background on the other side.

1033
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,780
Can you get the Godel's gorge sign in there too?

1034
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,180
Can I?

1035
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:16,580
Yeah.

1036
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:22,340
And Stevie is dragging Fox Godel from the underarms through the shot and then out of

1037
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:27,620
frame coming up on your like stage left on as you're looking out at this picturesque

1038
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:28,820
is not the right word, huh?

1039
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,820
Indelible site.

1040
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:33,460
Something you'll probably have a hard time forgetting.

1041
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:39,620
I give the five, four, and then a sign that three, two, one.

1042
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,380
Terror in our own backyards.

1043
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:46,900
A news crew kidnapped, brutalized, and the story of our fantastic escape.

1044
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,460
Tonight on city action news.

1045
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,940
I'm Cal Colorado signing off.

1046
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:53,780
Julius.

1047
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:56,660
Julius screams in just joy.

1048
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:58,660
Yes!

1049
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:17,620
Let's dog those doors.

1050
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:18,820
Let's dog those doors.

1051
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,300
Julius, uh, texts his uncle, we're on the way.

1052
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,700
As we're like loading up the van.

1053
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:28,980
I'm like, Julius, could you, uh, could you show me how to use TikTok?

1054
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:33,060
Julius just smiles and like motions for Cal's phone.

1055
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:36,900
Cal hands it over with a big grin.

1056
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:39,620
He shows you the background.

1057
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,260
That's my daughter.

1058
00:51:41,380 --> 00:52:03,860
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.
