0.00 274.80 speaker0  Hello, my little weirdos. It's your giant father, Wolf the Dog. And I'm here to embrace you freaky little dudes. Society may reject you, but your great mother wolf never shall. You provide your ears, your minds, your energies. And I am shipping out auditory waves live from 694.2 PTBP. The only radio station that lets little weirdos like you write in things that I am contractually obligated to read. Speaking of, this edition of Howlin' with Wolf comes from Liddy in the City, who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod. The third best thing you can do with them thumbs. Altagirl is keepin' my grip strong as I move along. Swiftly through this shitty city. But I long to be strong. To no longer be a pawn who keeps calm. I want the full throttle. No doddle logical like Aristotle. Light the rag in this bottle. Fuck Fred Godel. There was an awful lot of rhymin' in this Howlin' with Wolf. Is this that slam poetry I've heard so much about? Now you did a good job, Liddy in the City. I would snap my fingers in appreciation. But unfortunately, the grease prevents any friction between any of my body parts. tag at Pretending Pod on your social media accounts and let your friends know that you're an absolute weirdo. If they're your friends, they're probably pretty strange too. And if you want to have that sort of conversation in public, go to PretendingPod.shop and grab a hat that says PTBP or a super rad fanny pack with a four-panel cartoon of What Went Down at Splashylvania on it. You'll have a new group of freaks to hang out with in no time. Don't go out? You can take this game to a high score situation by posting pics of your hot new PTBP merch online from the comfort and safety of your mobile device. The options are endless. And the links are in the show notes. S-E-G-U-E S-E-G-U-E S-E-G-U-E And yes, this is a segue. It's time for the news. Last time, Julius ran back into Grover's Gorge to get away from the wet energy that erupted out of Chuck Bidwell's body when it landed in the unnatural chasm, exploded through the stained glass of the church that stuck upside down in the smooth crevasse, and everyone else was knocked unconscious. The conscious can field producer found Fox Gottel and brought him back to the rest of the can crew with a plan. As they came to, Julius asked Stevie, as the eldest Gottel in the area, to declare Fox the new mayor of Grover's Gorge. No one expected it to work, but that sloppy god came bursting back out through the colorful church windows and launched Fox Gottel into the air like a video game KO. Let's have a toon take us to the action. Here's an oldie, but a goodie. It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.
274.56 278.64 speaker2  Yeah. High School Musical 2.

305.76 318.56 speaker2  Is that the one where things become color? Yeah. Nice. Sinful. Because of it. Because of cum-een.
316.16 344.32 speaker3  and the cherry blossoms are floating over the car and Edda James, at last, is playing is like... I didn't jerk off to that one. Cinema bliss. It's a good scene. There's also... He's describing what the world outside of Pleasantville is like and Dave Brubeck's Take 5 It's such a cool scene.
343.36 346.48 speaker1  You watch that Andor?
344.32 352.96 speaker3  I'm not caught up, but I've seen... I think I'm just like one behind. Cool.

375.20 385.76 speaker3  Like watch it. If you're listening, watch it. Because I want more of it.
384.56 387.28 speaker2  Oh, well don't do that.
385.76 389.20 speaker3  Just say it where people can't talk back.
388.56 414.24 speaker2  No, no, no. Nobody ever talks back. It's just that they're like, No one ever talks back. Exactly. I'm glad, nerd. Good for you. You have a gritty Star Wars. Wow. Now a gritty Star Wars. I'd be interested.
412.72 420.40 speaker1  It's set on Kashyyyk.
419.92 422.96 speaker2  I don't know. Watch the shit out of that.
421.84 428.56 speaker3  The day it came out.
426.48 453.20 speaker2  but I will enjoy until the day I die. And my kids will be like, Yeah, everything's a gritty. Everything's a gritty is incredible.
452.48 458.32 speaker3  It's pretty good.
454.72 464.24 speaker2  Speaking of gritty, we all look a little grittier now, don't we, boys? Do you mean the can crew?
460.64 465.84 speaker3  No, I mean, well, the king crew definitely fucking works pretty gritty.
464.24 471.12 speaker2  Or do you mean us after two and a half years of a pandemic?
469.52 481.28 speaker3  We were all gritty for Halloween. That's right. We were all gritty for Halloween. No, but we should have done that. Gritty gang. Aren't we a little bit more gritty guys? You're right.
480.08 483.68 speaker2  We got tat week.
482.80 496.48 speaker3  Sick tats. Dude, we got sick tats.
493.84 504.48 speaker2  Four white guys got a tattoo to commemorate their podcast.
503.60 511.44 speaker3  Likely. No, no. It just happened to be our podcast logo.
510.56 536.32 speaker2  Oh, hell yeah. I might get more skulls of different styles. You should just get the same skull all over. I should know. I'm just going to get the PTPB skull. One for every man you've killed. Yeah. Well, I never do. It's good. I think if you don't, I guess.
535.44 564.48 speaker3  Is that better? We're on episode 16 of season two. We're like getting into the weeds of this thing. Shit is popping off. Shit is popping off. What is going through your mind?
560.88 577.92 speaker2  What were we doing in episode 16 of season one? Just for some, like, you know, some sort of reference.
574.32 593.68 speaker3  So it was the second of three flashback episodes. Oh yeah.
590.00 606.40 speaker2  The officers check out the house of the Lord. So we go to the church and you eat their pasta salad or whatever it was?
605.12 614.32 speaker3  only episode 16.
611.76 627.68 speaker2  I think we can do this one faster.
625.60 641.44 speaker3  Let's try to go into spoilers on season one. I know we talked about eating food and that's pretty intense, but... You're right. With no incident.
638.48 648.08 speaker2  I was just like, oh, we should have, we should have figured out some more of this.
644.96 656.40 speaker3  Do you feel like you're getting the information, the lore? Do you feel like you have an understanding of what's going on? We nailed that God total shit.
655.20 664.32 speaker2  Yeah, we're all over this.
663.52 677.68 speaker3  It's real easy. There was a God turtle and through the decades, it became Godel.
674.88 694.40 speaker2  Turn everyone into a church. Perfect.
693.36 704.32 speaker3  Dive on in. You, I believe, broke yourself.
702.00 714.56 speaker2  Sorry, I am doing a season one re-listen. We're also, we just played. Yeah.
709.44 731.36 speaker3  And by the time you hear this episode, you can go to patreon.com slash pretending pod and check out. Well, maybe by the time you listen to this episode, Pettymore, Clark Bishop, and Keith Vigna.
730.08 742.64 speaker2  Oh, I'm so sorry. Doing what? We trick or treated. We smell my feet. We got us something good to eat it. Perfect.
740.32 782.32 speaker3  So you can go to patreon.com slash pretending. Mation motion picture. Now I don't have to wiggle my fingers in my ears. Thomas. This season, season two, we are choosing our own, so it's kind of up to us to decide whatever your mania phobia weird character hiccup is. So what was it that happened when you broke? What did you see?
781.52 797.60 speaker2  I don't really know. You told me it was an Olympic pool sized fluid amount of wet energy. Big wet energy or a little wet energy? I clearly yeah. Olympic. Okay.
794.40 802.40 speaker3  So are you afraid of people who look like they might be Olympians?
798.56 808.40 speaker2  My only, the only way this affects me is that I have a distaste from Michael Phelps.
807.36 814.00 speaker3  That's quite a coincidence.
811.44 815.44 speaker2  And one of the ways he keeps that up, what? I saw that dance.
814.88 831.68 speaker3  Oh, right. Exactly. laps.
828.48 838.08 speaker2  I don't know what a good amount of laps across an Olympic swimming pool is.
836.32 840.32 speaker3  be best for living.
838.72 862.08 speaker2  You don't want to stop halfway through. Nope. 10 or 15 years younger. Perhaps. And he may not realize it standing here right now looking at this thing.
859.60 864.80 speaker3  by the plant wall, seemingly wet.
862.08 882.72 speaker2  He doesn't like it that he doesn't like it at all. And the next time he might, who knows if he stops himself as he walks out the door, go into the pool or if he gets to the edge and reaches in and like starts to dive in. Sure.
878.80 887.52 speaker3  the pool and I think it's, I think it's going to be large bodies, large bodies of water.
883.44 888.32 speaker2  And maybe, maybe some, maybe some water in general, but mostly large masses.
887.52 984.64 speaker3  Whatever you do, man. So the end of the last episode, it's hairy as far as what we can listen to, but I think I'm frozen in shock at my moment in time. Absolutely frozen in shock as you're looking down, which means that you see first this church building that you see in the bottom of this unnatural chasm in this valley. It is filling it up in the bottom and then it is flying up out toward you over the cliff. with a thud. The wet that has been surrounding and around and just pushes itself in and around him almost seems to dissipate into nothingness as you see a soaking wet Fox Godel laying unconscious on the ground. I need Beck Wilder and Julia Summers to roll grip. Thomas, you rolled last time.
984.08 1000.40 speaker1  I pass.
994.48 1017.36 speaker3  and because you've seen it before, this kind of impacts your opinion of the last time you saw this happen, right? You almost expected it halfway through, but then it's all of a sudden over. You slightly see the same result and Julia Summers, I need you to roll a d4 and add one.
1013.28 1024.56 speaker2  That's a three plus one, which gets me to my breaking point.
1022.56 1059.12 speaker3  Julia Summers, where are you at grip wise? What did you start with? What's your power power? 60. Dang. You're almost halfway through the grip that you had the tethered to the world in which you lived is almost halfway gone. In that case, let's hit you with this breaking point right now. Joe Thomas, headphones babies.
1058.32 1066.40 speaker2  Yeah, that's right.
1064.56 1082.72 speaker3  You've had a lot happen to you. You're currently like face half broken, barely like the bones barely holding themselves together. Every time you like move quickly, you kind of feel the ajarness within the skeleton of your face.
1081.68 1086.56 speaker1  Owie, owie, dude.
1085.20 1090.16 speaker3  That is not good.
1089.84 1099.04 speaker2  Okay.
1093.12 1119.30 speaker3  We have the cane that hit your face repeatedly that brought you to this point. It's the most physical pain you've ever been in your life, I would assume. Yeah. Closest he's ever been to dying for sure. Yeah. So I think maybe doing something with your face is a fine idea. Doing something with heights is a fine idea. Doing something else with water is a fine idea.
1118.80 1129.52 speaker2  Whoa. But it's like, not feel somehow trapped in a body that is not my own. Fascinating.
1127.52 1135.12 speaker3  Do you feel comfortable playing that? Sure. Fuck yeah. That's scary. Right.
1132.48 1138.32 speaker2  I think not until he sees his reflection. That's right. That's right. Okay. Sounds good, man.
1137.76 1145.44 speaker3  All right, cool. Let's burn him back. Okay, cool. Thomas, what were you listening to? The new Beths album. Ooh, love them.
1144.80 1152.88 speaker2  Me too. The new Beths.
1149.20 1166.72 speaker3  Beck Wilder cannot even move his face. You just hear the thrust and out of the corner of your eye, you see Fox Gottel flying out of eye shot. Nailed it. Why?
1165.12 1172.88 speaker1  Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
1167.68 1226.40 speaker3  And Stevie is trying to hold back the vomit that seems to be coming. Oh, and she cannot hold. She starts blowing. wearing a monochromatic gray scale jumpsuit leisure wear with green accents like he's been dancing in the AR goggles have literally landed in the place where he was just standing at least, god, I don't even know, like 36.8 feet away.
1224.96 1234.48 speaker2  He's just like vanished?
1232.32 1261.04 speaker3  And you see him wearing those clothes. I want to, I guess, pick up the goggles. in a ring collecting game.
1257.28 1290.72 speaker2  finally just pulls the headset off and you can see he's been like sobbing. Julius sees his own reflection in the visor, the visor goggles. And he just starts kind of like looking and like squeezing his face and like scratching his face.
1283.92 1297.76 speaker3  like you see some of the cartilage is like pushing out of his skin as he's playing with it.
1295.68 1310.72 speaker1  Oh, Thomas, you're going to make me. Oh no. Am I jumping out of freeze mode?
1310.24 1319.84 speaker2  Not yet.
1315.36 1331.60 speaker3  Stevie has run over at this point and crawled over on her hands and knees. And they're just like over their brother's body, touching the face, holding the head up.
1330.72 1366.16 speaker2  It worked. We it let's try to maintain some journalistic, uh, standards here. We cannot confirm or deny that that is God. Well, the, the turtle spirit isn't right. Let's hope Beck got that.
1362.08 1378.56 speaker3  Of this church upside down in Godel's feet. Canyon crevasse.
1377.20 1398.96 speaker2  I sure hope so. Fingers crossed. Right. And we get over there and I'm, Pass nine on whatever.
1398.48 1425.76 speaker3  Oh, good.
1424.24 1441.44 speaker2  Church doors. Oh, that's a church door. That is the creepiest kind of door you can open.
1438.64 1490.96 speaker3  It's the sound just kind of bounces back and forth. You all see figures exiting the church going up. Seemingly that fog that rose and formed the penetrable wall previously has dissipated. There must be like steps coming up from the church because these bobbing people is this Somehow maybe steps, maybe some sort of pathway. Must be steps or a pathway. you all stand on.
1489.52 1512.56 speaker2  Are you seeing, are you seeing this buddy? We got a frozen. The camera won't move. He starts shaking you, but like by the shoulder back back, snap out of it. Sorry. Delayed reaction.
1511.92 1542.48 speaker1  My dad. Oh God. Oh, Cal dude. I saw it. It's I saw it. Who, who, who, who are they?
1535.52 1558.08 speaker3  And as he zooms in on this roving gang heading up, you see how many figures are we talking here? We are talking nine figures. Seemingly a billion. And as you zoom in, you see a gaggle.
1557.04 1560.16 speaker1  That's 10 figures. Nice.
1559.04 1597.68 speaker3  They're just geese. They're school children. No, they're wearing school uniforms. And as you guys are looking into the viewfinder of Beck's camera to watch and see these people head up in the back of the group, you see the last school child wearing the same uniform is like on all fours, like on their knuckles and their toes. The next boy, he is just a normal kid.
1596.56 1608.56 speaker2  I don't like that one.
1604.00 1618.64 speaker3  You can't zoom in that far, but they seem to be wearing school uniforms. However, in the back you see, it's like they've got red. Yeah. There's like a bit too much red around on all of them as they come closer to the top.
1617.84 1645.20 speaker2  Stevie, what do you think of this? Toward your shelf. Red just around them? Yeah. You're not just going to keep talking about it while they keep climbing. On their clothes. We get to do something about this.
1639.76 1680.88 speaker3  As you look down, it's got sharpened claws that are holding onto a leash. And this human body is wearing a school uniform. And on the leash, there is just a jaguar. Cool. The cat. It is wearing the school uniform as it follows up the rear as they make it closer to the top. And you zoom in. You see that they have blood on their hands, on their faces, and on their uniforms.
1678.80 1698.08 speaker2  I need you all to roll grip. Damn. Glad I had that in my notes.
1696.96 1710.32 speaker1  Why I don't lose sanity? Yeah. I got nothing. I don't... Okay. Lose one grip. I'll lose one, yeah.
1706.24 1716.00 speaker2  The frame wobbles just a minute as it loses a little composure and gets it right back.
1714.32 1718.24 speaker3  That is four more for me.
1717.20 1727.12 speaker1  Oh, shit.
1726.24 1733.28 speaker3  Not quite. Oh, no? 32. Oh, damn. My bad.
1731.84 1733.78 speaker2  Whoa.
1733.28 1737.60 speaker1  Damn. God damn.
1735.36 1766.00 speaker2  Is that a flight, flight or freeze? It's like Kangaroo Jack. Beck, I don't know what's going on with me, but I'd ask you to shut the fuck up.
1759.20 1779.12 speaker3  You just hear sobs and wailing from behind you as kind of the realization of what this all means sets in. Stevie's sobs? Stevie is sobbing from behind you.
1777.76 1786.00 speaker1  Is he still unconscious?
1784.32 1796.96 speaker3  you would see that he's still on the ground.
1791.28 1806.80 speaker2  And he just goes over and just is like looking at Fox. He's like, I got to look at something that's not going to be that.
1805.36 1815.92 speaker1  It's just not fair.
1813.92 1883.76 speaker2  to walk off the ledge like Chuck. Nice. I chose a fight as the least likely. It doesn't even make sense in this situation. I would be that horrified. So Cal also just turns his back on this and he's like, you're filming this, you got this. Looks like you got a good frame there.
1878.48 1904.48 speaker3  steel train car sized simple steel car train station. And you see Fox got on the ground and Stevie hands and knees over him and Julius standing kind of hunched over next to Stevie and Cal backing up toward them.
1903.12 1910.48 speaker1  What are they focused on? Are they looking at us? Are they maybe zombie-like?
1909.12 1923.92 speaker3  And they're not walking up stairs. Oh, I thought they were just like climbing the wall, right?
1922.24 1930.64 speaker1  I thought, yeah, I don't know. I think it's ghost stairs because you said the kangaroo had a human walk. It did have a gate, yeah.
1928.72 1934.16 speaker2  As it goes straight up the wall.
1931.68 1961.46 speaker1  So what do they seem to be focused on? supposed to like do that from like a scientific perspective, but they've got blood on their Zoinks.
1957.78 1975.38 speaker2  Julius snaps back in and he knows that we have to get this on film. Julius whips around and just goes, Beck, don't stop filming.
1973.94 1978.66 speaker1  Oh yeah, I'm filming, dude. We got to, we got to talk to him.
1977.86 1992.10 speaker2  No, no, no, no. I agree with Beck. We need to get back to our mystery machine immediately. And I think we need to take Stevie and God. Let's fucking go. Yeah. Stevie, we got to take your God brother in our van with us. Fine.
1991.30 1993.46 speaker3  Let's go.
1992.66 2007.54 speaker1  Into the train, dudes.
2006.34 2008.74 speaker3  And I need you to roll grip.
2008.18 2015.46 speaker2  Is it like.
2013.46 2038.98 speaker3  You're not squishing into his body like Jell-O. And as you don't pass, you drop Fox Godel as you lose one grip and you cannot pick him back up. That makes a pretty good sound.
2034.26 2043.14 speaker2  Julius catches a glimpse of himself and some of the water that's like reflecting
2042.42 2044.50 speaker1  Boom.
2043.14 2098.26 speaker2  First one in. Julius Summers. And he is terrified. He looks back at the twenties. He looks back at the pant leg and he completely shutters. It takes a huge sigh and like, let's go out. He feels the water running out. He knows where it's from. I'm going to look over to the side here and just let's walk straight. Walk straight. Okay. Quickly, quickly. All right. Yes. Yes. Beck. Come on Beckworth.
2096.42 2106.50 speaker3  The news mate waits for no one.
2102.74 2117.46 speaker1  People coming up the stairs, but he is backing it into the train.
2113.22 2136.10 speaker3  And they are on the same plane as the can crew. And they are staring barrel down, eyes straight into the camera. All of them as they begin running.
2134.42 2160.66 speaker1  hoping maybe they would just kind of give me a nice wave back. What do you do as you're halfway, hello there kind of wave. And when he sees them start sprinting, he uses the wave to grab the top doorframe of the train car and throw himself backwards into the train car and hope that the door closes behind him.
2159.86 2174.26 speaker2  Keep filming. Julius says as he's looking out the window, but also at his reflection.
2172.42 2177.78 speaker1  Move train, train, train move. Oh, oh, oh.
2174.98 2194.58 speaker2  Cal throws the last of the lasagna out of his pocket. Yes.
2191.70 2228.42 speaker3  these modern flat screens flicker to life. You see a blank white soundstage with a white stool and a man walks into frame, sits on the stool and smiles at you all, the viewers. that consistently look like they're about to fall off his nose. And the group of bloody school children with animal compatriots runs closer to you all.
2228.10 2228.98 speaker0  We got it.
2228.66 2248.74 speaker3  Hi, Fred. Hey, Fred. We're going. We're finally Fred. Do you have some sort of... I think I got some.
2248.18 2252.26 speaker1  What is it? You want to see what I rolled?
2251.14 2255.54 speaker2  Yep, yep, yep, yep.
2253.70 2256.10 speaker1  Are you fucking kidding me?
2255.54 2257.78 speaker2  99.
2256.10 2308.42 speaker1  That's a 99. to try and get this fucking train going.
2305.38 2346.26 speaker3  Some of us might not make it and we might not be able to get Fox across. That's going to be our most important task, okay? Thank God I'm not afraid of heights. it again and we have to get him across. But I guess this thing isn't going to start, so we need to get the fuck over across right now. Do you have some sort of mechanical engineering? Anyone with mechanical engineering? Strength?
2344.90 2349.86 speaker2  I don't have anything.
2349.30 2353.06 speaker3  It could work.
2349.86 2368.74 speaker2  It's a smart train kind of past 21 on a 50.
2367.62 2401.46 speaker3  the train moving. Should we cut out the part where I came up with a super cool idea to run across the train tracks?
2394.90 2427.54 speaker2  That's another full episode of us being picked off one by one by monsters. As the doors shut, Julius wants to address the train as if it is Frank Godel. Wait, is that their dad or grandpa? I rolled luck and succeeded.
2427.30 2429.46 speaker3  Right.
2428.58 2435.70 speaker2  Gotcha. Is this their grandpa or their dad talking?
2435.06 2445.06 speaker1  That is correct. And Frank is the grandpa? Also correct.
2442.18 2469.86 speaker3  So yeah, the other one continues to play. He's a soft looking man. His guy says, thank you for coming and experiencing my pride and joy. Grover's gorge. I'm thrilled that you came and joined me on a tour of the future. While you leave, please think very seriously about if you'd like the outside world to mirror this gorge, this little town.
2464.74 2495.30 speaker2  Julius looks at the TV and just says, Fred, your children are on board. Please go. I got a 99. What? You said roll to feel good about this. So all that happens is that he rolls.
2492.66 2499.46 speaker3  Thankfully, either way, it doesn't do anything, you know?
2497.78 2511.14 speaker2  Don't try to reason with the machine.
2510.10 2523.70 speaker3  better place. And the single simple steel train car begins moving.
2518.58 2545.46 speaker2  And Kal, like as those things like start slapping like against the wall while we're slowly pulling away, Kal starts doing the TikTok dance like in their faces.
2538.82 2577.78 speaker3  You see the bottom of its legs scraping as it suddenly disappears and it is on top of this simple single steel train car. We are in dexterity order. Luke, what does Julius Summers do? the other side, standing on the shore. The shore of the cliff. Nailed it.
2576.50 2585.86 speaker2  The side we just left?
2580.10 2589.86 speaker1  I thought maybe there was like another group that we were heading towards.
2588.66 2593.14 speaker2  There's no spatial switcheroo. Everything is the same on both sides.
2591.06 2606.42 speaker3  There's just a leopard on top. Or is it a leopard?
2605.94 2614.66 speaker2  Bitch. Oh!
2614.42 2619.94 speaker1  Fail.
2617.62 2632.18 speaker2  I'm not going to roll because Julius would have no...
2626.58 2653.62 speaker3  However, Cal Colorado confidently says that into your camera. It starts playing that same animation and the voiceover is coming over as Dexterity Order hits Beck Wilder, you're up.
2648.50 2657.38 speaker1  as he follows the sound of the steps of the paws of the claws of the jaguar.
2656.42 2662.74 speaker3  Back and forth. Back and forth.
2658.74 2666.18 speaker1  Dudes, like, when the train stops, we gotta like hold the door closed.
2664.58 2677.38 speaker2  And Cal thinks with all his might, oh, I want to use that critical success biology rule about jaguars to interpret some feline behavior here.
2674.90 2682.90 speaker3  Let's interpret some feline behavior. Yes.
2679.54 2686.82 speaker2  Quick, everyone, anything shiny you have, gather it all up.
2684.50 2698.02 speaker3  so there's got to be something shiny in that bag.
2694.26 2700.98 speaker1  We don't have a lot of that stuff because we left it in the lockers when we came here. Oh, fuck.
2699.14 2705.30 speaker2  But it's where we're going to.
2700.98 2708.42 speaker1  I'll use like a lens of a lens I'm not using on my camera, and it can probably reflect some.
2707.38 2714.50 speaker2  Yes, that's brilliant. We'll use it as a giant laser pointer.
2712.58 2720.26 speaker1  Through this, and I could point it. Where do you want me to open it?
2719.54 2725.78 speaker2  I kind of aim it.
2724.26 2742.58 speaker1  To see if it'll run it over.
2741.62 2747.14 speaker3  to film. Yeah, I agree. I thought you might.
2746.26 2754.02 speaker1  That's a pass. That's a six on a 80. I failed. Is it critical?
2753.30 2757.86 speaker3  Catacle?
2757.30 2774.50 speaker2  Oh.
2766.98 2792.18 speaker3  This jaguar jumps in front of the single simple steel train car that you are riding in. And as the single simple steel train car continues on the tracks away from the single simple steel train car, walking nimbly across the tracks. And as it tries to make it.
2791.54 2796.50 speaker2  I'll tell you that.
2795.78 2804.82 speaker1  An 88.
2804.02 2822.42 speaker2  bad about this.
2820.10 2871.22 speaker3  with you all approaching it. It sees, it must make the leap now. You're coming up right behind it. It jumps for the edge knowing about how far a cliff side might be away from it. However, its claws can normally sink in much easier to maybe a normal cliff or typical mountain side. However, this is an unnaturally smooth cliff side Mufasa.
2870.34 2889.22 speaker2  Well pointed. It was us or him. Maybe he just wanted to talk.
2884.42 2929.54 speaker3  the Godel company has continued that practice into these modern times. So thank you for opening your eyes, opening your heart and opening your mind to a future And the doors try to open. And you all remember that they've been like jammed shut. Currently. Like what's the, what is the feel within this train car right now?
2927.86 2931.38 speaker2  Or are they just standing on the other platform?
2929.54 2940.34 speaker1  Yeah, that's a, what do we see behind us?
2940.10 2943.62 speaker2  Yeah.
2940.34 2950.26 speaker3  Cause you can't see, you can't see, you could lean your head out the window and you see they're not, they're not trying to walk across the train tracks.
2949.38 2982.34 speaker2  It's pretty creepy. Actually, Beck, get a shot of this. He slipped. I'll help him out. I need help. Okay. Everybody Beck, you keep filming, but uh, Stevie, if you could give us a hand here.
2981.38 2988.66 speaker1  Oh, pass for me.
2987.62 3015.78 speaker3  You see the big sign. Welcome to Godel's gate to Grover's gorge. You see the lockers and looking across at the other side, you see this group continuing to just stand and stare.
3013.86 3027.62 speaker1  Can you get the Godel's gorge sign in there too?
3022.34 3046.90 speaker3  frame coming up on your like stage left on as you're looking out at this picturesque is not the right word, huh? Indelible site. Something you'll probably have a hard time forgetting.
3041.38 3058.66 speaker2  A news crew kidnapped, brutalized, and the story of our fantastic escape. Tonight on city action news. I'm Cal Colorado signing off.
3058.18 3078.82 speaker1  Yes!
3077.62 3100.26 speaker2  Let's dog those doors. Julius, uh, texts his uncle, we're on the way. Julius just smiles and like motions for Cal's phone. That's my daughter. Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.
