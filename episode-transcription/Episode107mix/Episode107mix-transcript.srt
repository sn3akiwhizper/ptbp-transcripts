1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to the cream zone, my pastries.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's your putrid patissier, Papa Wolf the dog,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,620
and I am here to cover all the butter-filled dough

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,420
in various sweet sauces of my choosing.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,760
I hope y'all like some sweet grease.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,760
I am rolling out that dough live from 694.2 PTBP,

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,640
the only radio station that doubles

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,440
as a bakery in the dream times.

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,280
Now I know y'all know that I love kneading that dough,

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,080
but what I really need is some external validation

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,400
from the listeners of my show.

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,200
I have a need to knead,

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,980
but my need to be kneaded is so much greater.

14
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,440
This howling with Wolf was sent in by Modern Cannabis

15
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,700
from Grand Junction, Colorado,

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,920
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,120
an equally meaningful and easy thing to do.

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,120
He writes,

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,720
Hey Wolf, the music you put out pleases

20
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,800
the deepest depths of my soul.

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,840
Keep spinning those great tunes

22
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,000
and munching on the slimiest of fine foods.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,920
I hope those contention boys you keep telling us about

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,960
manage to vacuum up all that nasty ooze

25
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,760
I keep seeing out and about.

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,520
And lastly, a shout out to the best playing group

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,840
a fledgling keeper could ask for.

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,240
Kyle, Lexi, and Moriah couldn't ask for a better group

29
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,680
of funny, smart, and kind people to play with.

30
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,920
Lots of love, Modern Cannabis.

31
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,520
Well damn, thanks Modern Cannabis.

32
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,720
It sounds like you got a good group of buddies there.

33
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,980
I wish, I wish I had a couple of buddies

34
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,120
that were funny, smart, and kind.

35
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,120
All I got is my producer and my dog, Wolf the dog, the dog.

36
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,800
My producer is a piece of shit and Wolf the dog, the dog

37
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,280
merely tolerates my existence.

38
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,280
Maybe one day I'll have a friend too.

39
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,880
If you want to write up something for your pastry loving

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,680
Wolf the howl, write up a five star review

41
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,520
on Apple podcasts and send a screenshot

42
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,120
to pretendingpod at gmail.com

43
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,920
or just tag the show at pretending pod

44
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,120
on Instagram or Twitter.

45
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,120
In return, you can put words in my mouth.

46
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,000
What a damn deal.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,860
And while you're using your fingers to peruse

48
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,080
the unfathomable thing that is the internet,

49
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,740
stop by the damn subreddit.

50
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,880
Some kid named Luke shit posts there constantly

51
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,640
with the finesse of an Olympic athlete.

52
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,040
Or join us on the discord.

53
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,460
The community is just as sweet as they are filthy.

54
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,600
And if you want to trade currency for bonus content,

55
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,300
check out patreon.com slash pretendingpod

56
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,380
for 23 exclusive episodes.

57
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,340
The newest one from an ongoing Delta green

58
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,300
home brew campaign just dropped.

59
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,380
And that wily PTBP crew continues on live

60
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,100
in the den of sin this Friday night,

61
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,940
August 20th at 9.30 PM central time.

62
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,400
If I've said it once, I hope my producer saves the clip

63
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,920
so he can just play that audio again.

64
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,900
The links are in the damn show notes.

65
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,620
Here at the end of this story, there's everything to lose.

66
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,340
But no matter how gory, I'll be here with the news.

67
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,740
Last time Keith bumped into Silas Cole,

68
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,640
John had questions for his newest father figure

69
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,540
and Clark accidentally unleashed the other worldly beast

70
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,820
he's been freaking out about since episode 31.

71
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,940
But hey, at least this horrifying behemoth

72
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,220
is made of the dripping ooze that's plagued

73
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,940
the groups every step.

74
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,280
And also, thankfully, the incomprehensible monster

75
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,040
is mounted by an anatomically upgraded assassin

76
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,320
dressed as Fonzie that's controlled

77
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,380
by an unnatural metal ball,

78
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,600
hell bent on the destruction of humanity.

79
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,060
So that's nice.

80
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,820
Seems like a good time to take a hard look around

81
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,920
and ask yourselves, what's your favorite bop

82
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,580
with an open question as the title?

83
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,780
And why is it Drag It In 3

84
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,620
with What Kinda World Are You Livin' In?

85
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,620
["What Kinda World Are You Livin' In"]

86
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,620
["What Kinda World Are You Livin' In"]

87
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,740
When Thomas dies, you'll get his podcast money.

88
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,220
Can I have all your stuff and your points in the podcast?

89
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,520
Oh, like my points in the podcast so far?

90
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,340
Like, as far as the leaderboards go?

91
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,140
Yes, the leaderboards that I have.

92
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:17,980
You've never seen this whiteboard.

93
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,420
The fans don't know about this,

94
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,260
but there is a complicating scoring system

95
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,340
that Zach uses to keep us funny.

96
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,260
To keep you.

97
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,540
And just to keep you.

98
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,220
You know, just like working with any auteur,

99
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,060
there's some give and take with working with Zach.

100
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,920
He gotta give a little, and he takes a lot,

101
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,780
and that's how you make art.

102
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,780
So, you know, if that requires manipulating

103
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,420
and breaking down your players until they,

104
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,860
until they, you know, until they're not themselves anymore,

105
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,340
they're just little balls of clay that you can mold.

106
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,700
That's what Zach's done for us.

107
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,900
You're all Jenna Maroney,

108
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,040
and I'm the bad guy from Iron Man 2.

109
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,260
Mickey Rooney?

110
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,860
Or not Mickey Rooney.

111
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,860
Wait, yeah?

112
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,700
Mickey Rourke.

113
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,540
No.

114
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,380
Mickey Rourke?

115
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,700
Mickey Rooney?

116
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,220
Mickey Rooney?

117
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,380
If all the Jenna Maroney, Mickey Rourke jokes

118
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,580
were about Mickey Rooney,

119
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,260
were about Mickey Rooney,

120
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,900
that would elevate an already great bit.

121
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,780
Wait, I think I just realized

122
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,660
that they are about Mickey Rourke and not Mickey Rooney,

123
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,620
which I was so confused by.

124
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,660
Wow.

125
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,500
Wow.

126
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,500
I just finished rewatching 30 Rock 2, so that's hilarious.

127
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,540
I've got a gripe to complain.

128
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,340
And she's like, tell me more.

129
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,240
What's up with iPhones today?

130
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,460
Is that Mickey Rooney or is that Iago?

131
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,380
That's more Mickey Rooney.

132
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,900
Well, you went a little Gilbert.

133
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,500
What's going on?

134
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,340
What?

135
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,160
All right, no.

136
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,580
So when we started recording this campaign

137
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,180
over three and a half years ago,

138
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,780
did you expect these small town contention cops

139
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,740
to end up fighting a partial Android dressed like Fonzie

140
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,260
controlled by an unnatural metal ball consciousness

141
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,140
that's riding an oozing shadowy ape kaiju

142
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,120
in an alternate plane of existence

143
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,260
as the future Messiah of a cult,

144
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,320
the founder of contention slash inventor

145
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,400
who created all these weird science items

146
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,600
and one of those inventions itself

147
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,800
in the body of its adopted father

148
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,380
alongside that adopted father's brother

149
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,720
who can burn people with his hands in reverse time itself?

150
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,020
No, I thought it would be something a lot cooler.

151
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,520
Probably like 10% of them.

152
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,800
Well, I'm just gonna open up this little envelope

153
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,720
that I made for myself at the beginning of all this.

154
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,760
And yeah, all those predictions are written right down here.

155
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,800
No, no, wait, Joe, show that to the camera.

156
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,620
Here, hang on.

157
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,920
You'll see I did write down,

158
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,480
I thought her name was gonna be Mary Beth.

159
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,480
I didn't write Rosemary, so I whiffed it on that one.

160
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,840
Whiffed it on that one pretty bad.

161
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,240
What did Beth stand for?

162
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,120
Better entity, time heathen.

163
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,160
Damn, Joe.

164
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,000
That's really solid.

165
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,320
Can time heathens be like the theme of our second season?

166
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,720
Yeah, well, no,

167
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,400
because I never wanna do time travel again, but.

168
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,800
The name of our prog band?

169
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,120
Yeah, time heathens fucking rules.

170
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,360
I know time bandits has a special place

171
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,320
in a lot of people's heart,

172
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,480
but if that movie was called time heathens,

173
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,400
I think it would be unbeatable.

174
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,880
What about clock stoppers?

175
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,400
That movie was great.

176
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,400
Is that like when you like interrupt two people

177
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,200
who are definitely gonna get it on?

178
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,040
Wait, no.

179
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,880
You said clock.

180
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,120
That's cock blockers.

181
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,000
Clock stoppers.

182
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,080
Clock stoppers has the weirdest ratio of being so bad

183
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,560
and being something I've thought about

184
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,280
ever since I've seen that movie.

185
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,160
Like the ability to stop time

186
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,840
and what you can do with that. It's not a good movie,

187
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,320
but like I've thought about it at least once a year

188
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,040
since I've seen it, probably more often than not.

189
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,280
Right?

190
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,240
Have you guys seen Time Fuckers?

191
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,240
Is that about the guys who fuck goobs?

192
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,720
That's spice holes.

193
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,680
Cilantro's.

194
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,560
Time Fuckers is just about this dog.

195
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,400
A dog?

196
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,640
Cool.

197
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,480
Right on.

198
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,360
I just watched Back to the Future for the first time.

199
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,200
Really?

200
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,280
You know that was originally gonna be called Time Fuckers?

201
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,320
That makes sense.

202
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,920
I heard a fact today that I didn't verify,

203
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,400
so I should probably check it

204
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,160
before I spread misinformation,

205
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,080
but I'm just gonna say it.

206
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,640
Apparently, The Muppet Show,

207
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,880
they made two pilots for that originally.

208
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,800
And one of them was called

209
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,720
The Muppets Sex and Drug Show or something like that.

210
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,280
And I don't know if that meant that they were gonna go

211
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,920
with an adult route for it, but that's what it was called.

212
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,760
It was like, The Muppets Sex and Drugs.

213
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,920
Or whether they were just gonna teach kids

214
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,360
about sex and drugs.

215
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,640
I don't know what the-

216
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,600
Like a reverse dare program?

217
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,640
This is a great scenario to introduce

218
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,840
without having any of the background for it,

219
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,040
because we can just wildly speculate

220
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,040
until Luke ruins it by looking it up.

221
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,880
Don't ruin it.

222
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,720
Don't look it up yet.

223
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,540
Don't ruin it.

224
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,380
Don't talk to him.

225
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,200
Don't talk to him.

226
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,360
It's violence.

227
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,200
Oh, even better.

228
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,040
That's right, yeah.

229
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,480
Okay, so is the pitch there that the network

230
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,320
is like, give us two ideas for a show

231
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,280
and they really wanna make The Muppets Show

232
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,040
and they're like, I guess if we give them

233
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,400
The Muppets Sex and Violence,

234
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,340
they gotta make The Muppets Show.

235
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,200
Oh my God, just thinking of like a Gritty.

236
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,320
Like Gritty in the sex and violence show, yeah.

237
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,040
Oh my God.

238
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,560
I mean, Gritty is the epitome of sex and violence.

239
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,360
Gritty is the ultimate villain of The Muppets.

240
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,120
Or the hero.

241
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,480
What about Gritty just as a detective in Philadelphia?

242
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,040
Sex and violence.

243
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,400
Gritty, sex and violence unit.

244
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,260
Gritty, sex and violence.

245
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,200
Yeah, SVU stands for sex and violence unit.

246
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,240
Gritty, sex and violence unit.

247
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,680
Gritty and his partner, Chris Maloney,

248
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,300
have to take on the mean streets.

249
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,240
Just fucking.

250
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,800
Remember when everybody saw Chris Maloney's

251
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,040
like ass in his pants a few months ago

252
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,680
and that was trending all over the place?

253
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,520
And people were like,

254
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,320
why is Chris Maloney's ass so good?

255
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,400
It makes sense.

256
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,240
Google that.

257
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,440
The man's got a rump.

258
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,200
That guy has a great ass.

259
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,660
He's got a real ass face.

260
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,620
You know when you look at somebody's face

261
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,620
and you can tell they got a nice dumper?

262
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,440
That jawline looks like it shits.

263
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,800
This is something I wanted to bring up.

264
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,200
Somebody on the Discord, you said like,

265
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,700
you know when you look at a person's face

266
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,840
and you see what you want to see and not what's there?

267
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,480
I don't know what that means.

268
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,960
And one person was like,

269
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,680
I wonder if Zach has a little face blindness.

270
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,360
And I just wanted to know if that,

271
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,880
do you think you do or?

272
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,440
Yeah, it's a good point, Luke.

273
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,600
Thanks.

274
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,440
What?

275
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,240
No, I just meant that when you are familiar

276
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,920
with someone over time,

277
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,000
you see them differently than I think that you would

278
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,320
if you were just seeing them as a stranger on the street.

279
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,160
I think that your perception of your relationship to them

280
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,000
and the way that they've treated you

281
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,100
and the way you've treated them

282
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,320
and the way that you perceive their actions

283
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,880
and the way other people perceive them

284
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,480
changes the way that you view them physically.

285
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,320
Yeah.

286
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,480
That's where I disagree.

287
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,320
Yeah, I know.

288
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,280
It's just my opinion.

289
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,120
And all of science backs me up.

290
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,280
Right, right.

291
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,840
It's just my factual opinion.

292
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,040
I forgot about those studies that you forwarded me,

293
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,360
which was like, hey, in the future,

294
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,420
if you ever need to know,

295
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,580
and Zach just sent me all these links

296
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,940
that were clearly to like crudely handmade websites,

297
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,260
but it was like University of Florida study confirms.

298
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,300
Science says.

299
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,140
Yeah, science says.

300
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,940
Scienceblockspot.com.

301
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,420
Anything Zach says in the future is correct.

302
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,060
Shitscientistsay.com.

303
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,460
And I was drunk enough the first few arguments

304
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,260
that that worked, but no more.

305
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,460
Oh boy.

306
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,580
I'm nervous.

307
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,060
My hands are sweating.

308
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,740
Fucking get over it, Zach.

309
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,740
Pull your shit together.

310
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,900
I'm kidding, it's okay.

311
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,100
Rose M-A-R-Y, a gaunt woman with crazy hair

312
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,060
and enormous thick glasses

313
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,300
that make her already large eyes look even bigger,

314
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,780
dripping with muck from every orifice,

315
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,460
wearing jeans and a white t-shirt with a leather jacket,

316
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,900
leapt off the back of her commandeered four wheeler

317
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,420
and mounted this thing of Clark's nightmares.

318
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,140
The four metal tentacles

319
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,340
that protrude from the back of her neck

320
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,820
wrapped around this incomprehensibly enormous beast

321
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,820
that drips with pure darkness.

322
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,380
And the camera dollied left

323
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,420
as this lumbering monster raced toward the ledge

324
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,860
of its unnatural toilet paper roll treadmill.

325
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,140
And as it falls,

326
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,380
the camera turns 90 degrees sideways

327
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,420
to match the change of the gravitational pull.

328
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:34,260
The luminous land on which you all stand shakes

329
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:39,260
as the Gigantumbra pithicus arrives on your axis

330
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:44,260
and Rose M-A-R-Y, muscle memory engaged,

331
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:49,020
leans back and casually throws a double thumbs up

332
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,700
as the goddamn muck and Mairi behemoth beneath her

333
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,780
roars in real sanity.

334
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,820
Oh, fuck.

335
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,340
I brought everything out here but my dice.

336
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,060
Yeah, I failed.

337
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,060
There should be some right in front of you, Thomas,

338
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,340
in the little, can you hear me?

339
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,620
You can still tell them where they are.

340
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,380
In the thing.

341
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,340
Nice, fucking nailed it.

342
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,980
The yarn boat.

343
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,780
Yarn boat, baby, yarn boat.

344
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,860
It's so yarny.

345
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,100
93, I fail.

346
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,940
How'd you do there, Clark Bishop?

347
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,660
You probably need me to roll again, right?

348
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,780
That's because it's bad audio or something, right?

349
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,460
This is the most I've ever wanted to lie about a roll,

350
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,700
I think, in the history of the show,

351
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,140
but it's an 82, so that's over my power.

352
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,420
Oh, right, mine's way over my power too, yeah.

353
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,900
Oh, I rolled over my power too.

354
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,500
I had a lot of time to think about

355
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,460
if I would lie about that roll or not.

356
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,980
I was sitting there stewing, looking at the dice

357
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,660
and saying, man, I could just say,

358
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,500
I could just say it's under my power.

359
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,340
I've lied about exactly one roll

360
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,900
in the history of this podcast.

361
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,100
It happened recently and I feel super, super bad about it.

362
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,940
Oh, shit.

363
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,900
Wow.

364
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,820
That's just, for all the role players out there,

365
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,380
don't do it, don't do it.

366
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,220
There's no-

367
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,460
I hate to do this, you're out.

368
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,020
We signed a contract.

369
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,340
That's fair.

370
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,300
We did a blood oath with Zach

371
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,980
that we would never lie to him.

372
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,300
Even as jokingly, that made me want to cry.

373
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,260
I'm sorry, dude.

374
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,460
At least you've learned your fucking lesson.

375
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,460
I just wanted to scare Joe straight

376
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,140
and any other listeners.

377
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,420
In the prison sense.

378
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,260
You like that?

379
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,820
You like the use of that language there, Thomas?

380
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,660
Well, that's not what that-

381
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,020
Feel good about that?

382
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,460
I felt awkward about it as soon as it came out of my mouth,

383
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,860
but that's not the intention of the phrase.

384
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,780
Prison, it's scared straight, not great.

385
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,340
Scared straight, not great.

386
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,820
I felt with a 52, which is over my power.

387
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,660
Oh my God.

388
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,740
This is the worst.

389
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,420
Yeah, this might be the end here.

390
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,500
If you would have succeeded-

391
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,580
Just take this one from the top.

392
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,420
You would have-

393
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,900
Yeah, Zach, how do you feel about

394
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,500
lying about some rolls right now?

395
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,500
How do you feel about lying about an episode?

396
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,100
I'm not going to do it.

397
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,380
Everything you planned this week down the shitter.

398
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,540
1d4 would have been your sanity damage

399
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,260
if you would have succeeded that check.

400
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,700
So I need everyone to do 1d8 plus one.

401
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,820
Holy shit.

402
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,940
Oh my God.

403
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,060
This really might be the end.

404
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,980
Three for me, two plus one.

405
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,380
Oh my God.

406
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,620
I rolled a one.

407
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,060
You fucker.

408
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,820
And I had to because I've only got four sanity, so.

409
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,940
Holy shit.

410
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,940
Oh damn.

411
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,420
I rolled a three plus one is four,

412
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:02,020
which brings me down to 12

413
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,540
and my breaking point is 10, so I'm good.

414
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,460
I take that back about having only four sanity.

415
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,300
I had seven.

416
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,540
I was looking at my breaking point.

417
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,420
So I'm at five total now with a breaking point of four.

418
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,020
Damn, dude.

419
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,220
This is bleak.

420
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,500
Although I did kind of prepare

421
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,540
because the next sentence in my notes is

422
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,180
resolve what will probably be a shit show.

423
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,740
Yeah.

424
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,900
Why would you think that?

425
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,180
I didn't hit my breaking point.

426
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,020
No one did.

427
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,260
No one hit their breaking point

428
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,300
and no one rolled five or more sanity.

429
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,740
So we don't have to do fight, flight or freeze.

430
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,980
And we don't have to take on any new manias,

431
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,820
but you did all roll over your power.

432
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,060
In combat order, which we are now in,

433
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,980
we're going to go through that.

434
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,980
And Don automatically, with an extreme sanity hit here,

435
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,740
even at your zero sanity,

436
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,380
we'll peek behind the curtain there,

437
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,420
Don D. Pettymore fully insane.

438
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,740
Yeah, mine is zero right now.

439
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,580
And who knows how long.

440
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,740
Did you roll over zero?

441
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,660
Yeah, I tried to roll, but I was just like, man.

442
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,780
The dice just stopped midair.

443
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,900
Threw it in the air.

444
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,420
You're a fatal.

445
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,020
Go ahead and roll, Justin, real quick for me.

446
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:19,860
Gotcha.

447
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,700
Oh, 15.

448
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,540
Okay.

449
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,900
Yeah, it's not over my willpower though,

450
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,580
but yeah, it's a little over zero.

451
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,460
Keith Vigna, you are standing next to yourself

452
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,340
as you see this lumbering beast roar

453
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:42,340
and the hair on your head is pushed back

454
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,300
by the sheer power of this roar.

455
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:50,260
Keith looks at the monster and at Rosemary

456
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,820
and then at all the people surrounding him

457
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,220
and he kind of starts to back away

458
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,940
until he looks down at himself on the ground

459
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,740
and sees the belts laying next to him.

460
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,740
And he grabs the belts and puts it around his own neck

461
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,500
but not his own neck, but his own neck

462
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:21,540
and starts to strangle Silas, Keith, Beans, Cole.

463
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,140
Silas Cole is far too weak

464
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,540
and the blood in his body is all in the wrong places

465
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,620
in order to resist this in a confident fashion.

466
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,860
Also, as I'm doing that,

467
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,420
I'm using one hand to kind of like strangle him

468
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,620
and one hand to massage the blood back up into his head.

469
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,460
Put it back, put it back, put it back, put it back.

470
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,140
I don't know why you brought this thing here.

471
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,620
A slender, muscular man in a black t-shirt

472
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,820
with tribal tattoo sleeves on both arms

473
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,380
going down his hands and fingertips

474
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,460
with friend branded on his forehead,

475
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,980
completely overwhelmed by terror,

476
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,660
knows that the only thing he can do in this moment

477
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,260
is try to take this thing down

478
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,580
and he sprints toward this huge creature

479
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,820
and he runs and he has this staff

480
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,140
made of pure darkness in his hand

481
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,260
and he's whipping it back and forth

482
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,460
on either side of him to build up momentum and speed

483
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,780
as he's sprinting toward this thing.

484
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,420
And as he's about to jump to take his blow

485
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:39,020
against this tree-sized limb that is hitting the ground,

486
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:43,820
this bipedal creature just lifts one of its legs

487
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:48,460
and stomps on the top of Germaine Glass,

488
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,260
pushing him fully into the luminous land you all stand on.

489
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:58,260
You see the body of Germaine Glass become engulfed

490
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:03,020
in the oozing darkness of this creature

491
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,980
and the entirety of Germaine Glass's body

492
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,260
dissipates into the leg

493
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,340
and as he is consumed,

494
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,660
the creature grows ever so slightly.

495
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,500
Oh no.

496
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,820
Clark Bishop, you see red.

497
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,940
Someone has to pay for this.

498
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,340
Clark had just done that to-do haka-noose thing

499
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,100
and it didn't work at fucking all

500
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,140
and in fact, it broke it loose.

501
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,300
So that's what he is flipped out about now.

502
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,300
I think he wants to try again

503
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,420
because he now is filled with rage.

504
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,420
He wants to hurt that thing

505
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,820
that he accidentally now has let loose.

506
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,660
I think that's the thing

507
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,820
he wants to try to take out his aggression on.

508
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,860
He's gonna try another spell

509
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,540
even though he doesn't know spells.

510
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,940
He's gonna try and summon it up from within him to do it.

511
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,780
I love it.

512
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,060
I love it.

513
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,820
Go ahead and roll a natural.

514
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,540
Oh, shit.

515
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,940
Are we doing the lying thing now?

516
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,620
Yes, yes, fuck yes.

517
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,660
It's an 81 on a 63.

518
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,620
Ooh-wee.

519
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,700
This is the worst.

520
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,660
I hate this.

521
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,500
This sucks.

522
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,140
You're laughing and giggling like it's fun though.

523
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,100
Fuck this game you've made us play.

524
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,940
And I love it.

525
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,820
I'm really happy personally

526
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,380
and I'm rooting for you guys

527
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,620
but I'm stoked about what just happened.

528
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,700
Clark, go ahead and chant for me.

529
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,860
Microwave dinner!

530
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,020
Microwave dinner!

531
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,500
Microwave dinner!

532
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,340
A powerful and ancient spell.

533
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,780
This enormous, powerful wave of these waves,

534
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,340
these tiny radiation waves emit from your mouth

535
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,340
and hit direct on this enormous lumbering creature

536
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:18,020
that is at least five stories tall.

537
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:22,820
And as it hits, this thing begins to crumble.

538
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,020
Like an ooze that is dissipating,

539
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,860
like a slug with salt being poured on it

540
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:34,660
and Rosemary is slightly losing her balance on top.

541
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,540
And then the vibration of this muck

542
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,380
inside of this creature

543
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,820
and covering the entirety of its outside

544
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:47,820
and its limbs go into itself before it splits

545
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:52,820
into two separate equally sized gigantumbra pithicuses

546
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,580
that are the same size as the original

547
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,540
but now there's two of them in front of you

548
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,060
and Rosemary is on one.

549
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,260
They put out their hands to each other

550
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,260
like Romeo and Juliet

551
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,940
in the Leonardo DiCaprio version in the class

552
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,140
and then they turn their massive, unnatural,

553
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,860
oozy, ape-like heads to face you all.

554
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,180
You done fucked up, Clark.

555
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,620
Oh, fuck.

556
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,020
Oh, shit.

557
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,140
My bad, my bad.

558
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,860
Don D. Pettymore, you hear a phone ringing.

559
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,380
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.

560
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,500
It's the, do y'all hear that?

561
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,860
John, do you hear that?

562
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,420
Do y'all hear that?

563
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,900
It's the phone.

564
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,660
And I start walking in the direction

565
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,940
that the phone is, seemingly oblivious

566
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,860
to everything around me.

567
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,380
I didn't hear anything, Don.

568
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:55,020
Which is the opposite direction of this gigantic beast

569
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,820
and you are walking toward the towering building

570
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,260
in the opposite direction.

571
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,500
I'd start walking at first but I'm picking up speed

572
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,220
while muttering to myself about the phone.

573
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,060
We can, we can fix all the, I can fix this.

574
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,140
I can fix this.

575
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,500
Like you can kind of hear him like repeating

576
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,500
things like that over and over again.

577
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,340
Radical.

578
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,740
John, your turn.

579
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,620
Having rolled over his power,

580
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,620
John Lee Kevin Ball has lost sight of what he is.

581
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,540
It finally all washes over him.

582
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:30,540
The split bodies, the lives, everything

583
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,860
and it's more than he can handle.

584
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,620
And the situation is overwhelming

585
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:40,460
but all he sees is Keith Beans killing his daddy.

586
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:46,420
A white like glow pops out, you know,

587
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,060
from the back of Sam Elliott's neck

588
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,540
and a silver ball shoots into the air.

589
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,860
Sam Elliott crumples like a little puppet.

590
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,060
Just to the ground.

591
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,380
Like you, like you cut its strings.

592
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,860
And, and there is, there is a silver ball

593
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,700
racing straight for Keith and Silas.

594
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,380
Holy shit.

595
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:20,380
Rose M-A-R-Y pinches the cuticle on her thumb

596
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,980
and begins to peel.

597
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:28,100
She pulls off a long strip of skin

598
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:32,260
from her nail bed to the crook of her elbow.

599
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,100
Hey Zach.

600
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,940
And blood.

601
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what's up man?

602
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,060
Ew.

603
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:36,900
Can we fuck that?

604
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,460
Hey Zach, can you not?

605
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,660
Yeah, we tried to keep sex out of the podcast

606
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,060
but if you could, you know,

607
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,580
obviously you're getting very, you're getting very,

608
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,220
I think it's gross when people force sex into role-playing

609
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,260
but we want to fuck that.

610
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:03,820
And this beautiful slit just has blood pouring out of it.

611
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,340
You're not going to get me

612
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,220
like you did with Giant Gash, buddy.

613
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,620
It's not going to work twice.

614
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:14,620
Blood pours down onto one of these gloomy beasts

615
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,940
as she pulls off the skin on her forearm like fancy gloves,

616
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:25,500
fingers first, and then one smooth removal.

617
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:30,500
Rose M-A-R-Y reveals a silver metal structure

618
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:34,780
and she cackles into the sky above.

619
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:40,460
You poor, pitiful animals.

620
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:46,820
You needed to so desperately remove me from your world.

621
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,700
You hunted me and my children, my creations for what reason?

622
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:58,620
Because we were already where you desire to be?

623
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,820
Or do you hate yourselves as well?

624
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,460
Regardless, humanity has had a good run,

625
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,020
much better than you deserved.

626
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:14,020
You claim to admire kindness and you reward the brutal.

627
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,700
You insist patience is a virtue

628
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,820
and you take advantage of the forgiving.

629
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,100
You honor loyalty?

630
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,980
It took absolutely zero effort.

631
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,460
And she points at Silas Cole,

632
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,300
fool branded across his forehead.

633
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,900
For one of your own to spill the beans

634
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,540
on the location of humankind's destruction.

635
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:44,540
I am going to take these black shiny devils

636
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:49,780
back to your world, break through Beans Pond

637
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,260
into the underground temple,

638
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:57,260
which houses vat upon vat of my beautiful residue.

639
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:02,060
Rise back up with a colossal strength

640
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,620
your minds could not begin to comprehend.

641
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:10,620
And then finally I am going to consume everything you know.

642
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,860
John Lee Pettyball stops dead in his tracks

643
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,740
searing towards that.

644
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,780
He had been speeding towards Keith and Silas,

645
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:24,100
but he stops, the ball turns around

646
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,300
from kind of just like the ground

647
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,180
and the air around you.

648
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:33,140
You hear the ball speaking and it says to Rosemary,

649
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,980
did you really just take the time

650
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:41,140
to fucking throw in a beans pun in your villain speech?

651
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,020
And that's enough to snap him out of his mania I think.

652
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,460
He's offended by that.

653
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:55,620
Pettymores never weren't much for poorly placed pun.

654
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,260
If your wordplay wasn't impeccable at a pettymore barbecue,

655
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,060
you would be ruthlessly scolded and ridiculed.

656
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:17,020
The second enormous gargantuan five-story tall creature

657
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:21,260
melts itself down into a puddle of ooze

658
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,620
and begins to climb the gigantic umbra pithicus

659
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,220
that Rosemary rides on,

660
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:33,220
making it twice as tall and twice as wide.

661
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,700
There is now a 10-story tall ape-like,

662
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:43,100
shadowy, dripping darkness kaiju

663
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,380
that is standing before you.

664
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,980
Rosemary is almost impossible to see.

665
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,220
She's 10 stories high off the ground

666
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,580
riding on the head of this creature

667
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:56,220
and you see her tentacles are just waving about

668
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,740
like she can't even control how fucking stoked she is

669
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,460
about the situation.

670
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,280
I'm gonna pee.

671
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,040
It will literally take 20 seconds.

672
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:10,500
One, two, three, four, five, six.

673
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,180
I'll believe it when I see it.

674
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,500
And hear it.

675
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:21,140
Springfield, Missouri ranked number 56

676
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,660
out of the top 200 biggest cities in the United States

677
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:28,660
for zombie apocalypse preparedness.

678
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,500
Yeah, that's pretty good.

679
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,740
I think you'd rate higher.

680
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,580
Shame we couldn't handle a real issue.

681
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,420
Yeah.

682
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,660
You shut the fuck up.

683
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,060
There's a building downtown that-

684
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,620
Like liberals.

685
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:43,180
My mom told me when I was like a teenager maybe,

686
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,300
so I don't know if she was correct.

687
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,140
I never looked this up.

688
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,260
I don't know if she was correct or not,

689
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,460
but there's a building downtown

690
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,380
that does nanotechnology work

691
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,820
and part of what the research was

692
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,820
was reanimating dead cells.

693
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,340
And so I've always thought we're gonna be ground zero

694
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,100
for any shit that goes zombie like that.

695
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,740
Just like the Delta's area.

696
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,900
68, 69.

697
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,740
Yep.

698
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,700
69 seconds, much longer than 20.

699
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,780
Much longer than 20.

700
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,460
I didn't start peeing until 13 seconds.

701
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,740
That's when I was in the bathroom and had things going.

702
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,580
I stopped at 38.

703
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,260
Well, it's hard to piss when you're rock hard.

704
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,540
I stopped shaking at 45,

705
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,140
and then I got back here.

706
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,060
That's a good shake.

707
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,660
Well, you know, as you get older, it takes longer.

708
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,660
My pee comes out faster than it's ever.

709
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,780
To make it quicker, I usually just shake it while I pee.

710
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,980
Slap it, whack it, throw it against the wall,

711
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,620
but until you put it back in your pants,

712
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,500
the last drop won't fall.

713
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,340
That's true.

714
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,780
Also, people who say if you shake it more than two times

715
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,900
or whatever, you're playing with yourself,

716
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,540
I don't know what kind of fucking fuck that person.

717
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,060
Yeah, fuck them.

718
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,580
They don't know what it's like to pee.

719
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,960
All right, well, this is the anthem,

720
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,540
so you guys should throw all your hands up.

721
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,140
Who was that?

722
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,340
Good Charlotte.

723
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,100
Good Charlotte, that's right.

724
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,660
Shake it once, that's fine.

725
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,540
Shake it twice, that's okay.

726
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:10,380
Shake it three times, you're playing with yourself.

727
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,620
Wait, really?

728
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,460
There's a song?

729
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,100
Yeah, that's the bridge of a song.

730
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,060
That's what I knew it from, yeah.

731
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:23,500
That song was the theme song of Madden 2003.

732
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,720
So it played every single time you opened that game,

733
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,060
so I had that song stuck in my head for years.

734
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,700
That album's pretty good for what it is.

735
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,620
That sounds like exactly the peak Madden year for Zaggy.

736
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:40,340
Little 11-year-old Zach, love that shit.

737
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,940
This creature just became enormous.

738
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,220
Thomas got hard, went pee.

739
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,580
So now we are at Keith.

740
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:49,340
Keith is strangling Keith,

741
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:54,340
but he hears beans between Mary and John Ball, Jovi.

742
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:59,340
Mary and John Ball, Jovi, he hears beans three times.

743
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,260
This damn beans pun is gonna be a downfall.

744
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,740
He hears beans three times

745
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,700
and it snaps him out of it.

746
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,340
He's hearing his last name

747
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,740
and he loses his grip on the belt

748
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,840
and stops massaging the blood up to Keith's head.

749
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,280
He looks at his friends around him

750
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,720
and he's like, she just told us her plan.

751
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,040
We can stop her now.

752
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,140
You hear reverberating around you.

753
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,300
Yeah, that's like a classic villain mistake

754
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,560
to just give it all away in the big reveal speech.

755
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,400
I completely agree, I'm on your side.

756
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,440
Keith.

757
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,520
Do you choke him less?

758
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,040
I drop the belt and it's just kind of like,

759
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,880
both of the belts are just kind of like,

760
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,160
he's wearing them like a necklace.

761
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,520
I get down on my knees and look Keith right in the eyes.

762
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,880
Hey, hey buddy, hey me.

763
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,040
You're gonna do something real important right now

764
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,240
and I'm gonna help you feel up to it.

765
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:15,800
You're gonna distract that.

766
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,680
And I gesture to the 10 story tall thing

767
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,600
and I put my finger up his nose

768
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,040
and pull my thumb like a finger gun.

769
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,060
And then I slap him on the back and say, go.

770
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,880
An enormous amount of glass family cocaine

771
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,720
goes straight up into the dome of Silas Cole who hasn't.

772
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,200
I thought you knew of some secret Keith button

773
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,120
up your nose, that every Keith had.

774
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,720
Technically it's a, I know how to unlock the powers.

775
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,400
But no, you just like really dosed him

776
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,980
dangerously against his will.

777
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,200
The ethics of dosing yourself.

778
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,040
If any of these characters cared about ethics,

779
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,040
they would have died a long time ago.

780
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,280
Or would have just left.

781
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,240
Probably wouldn't have stolen all the stuff

782
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,880
from the green box.

783
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,300
Anyway, I slap him on the back and say, go get him buddy.

784
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,720
I start running towards the building.

785
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,360
So Keith and Keith begin running in opposite directions.

786
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,640
It is Clark Bishop's turn.

787
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,160
Clark thinks our Keith's got the right idea.

788
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,480
I think getting in that building

789
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,200
is at least we'll buy some time.

790
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,200
John Ball, I don't know if you can hear me.

791
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,540
Can you hear me?

792
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,980
We're going for the building.

793
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:46,140
You don't exactly hear it, but like the vibe,

794
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,700
something about the way the air feels around your head.

795
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,300
Answers in assurance.

796
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,220
It's not like you hear the word yes.

797
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,340
Oh shit.

798
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:59,300
You just feel that like John said yes.

799
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,260
That's dope.

800
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:02,980
It's fucking rad.

801
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,660
Grab your uncle, we gotta, let's go.

802
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,020
He's already heading there.

803
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,980
I'm already on my way.

804
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,420
You wanna take that line again?

805
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,260
Let's follow Don.

806
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,180
And it's Don's turn.

807
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,140
And Don hears Keith coming up behind him.

808
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,420
Am I still hearing the telephone in front of me?

809
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,240
Oh yeah.

810
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,780
Louder and louder with each step.

811
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,180
Zeroed in on the phone.

812
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,940
I pick up my pace if I wasn't already in like a full run.

813
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,220
I'm just hoofing it.

814
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,220
Can you hear it?

815
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,740
Talking as though everyone's with me.

816
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,860
Do you hear it, John?

817
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,580
John, John, can you hear it?

818
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:50,400
The air answers back yes, you feel that.

819
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,640
And you also just hear like, it's gonna be okay.

820
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,940
And Clark hears, I'm with you, run.

821
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,740
And Keith hears, you're on the right path.

822
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:04,020
But if you stop to look back, the ball hasn't moved.

823
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:08,300
The ball sinks down from where it's floating in the air.

824
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,580
And it almost seems to like sink

825
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,300
into the ground a little bit.

826
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:17,300
You can see weird currents and jolts from the air around it,

827
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,480
sort of like snapping into where the ball is.

828
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,560
And there's a strange ozone smell

829
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,660
and there's electricity around you.

830
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,860
And that's all you see right now.

831
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,400
Oh my God.

832
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,260
Holy shit, what's going on?

833
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,100
Yeah.

834
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,900
For those of you running toward the building,

835
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:43,900
suddenly you see a man bent over head and hands and stocks.

836
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:48,660
He's dressed like he is in the old West actually.

837
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:52,800
And fool has been branded into his forehead.

838
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,560
And as you're running toward him, you can hear him.

839
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,060
He's just muttering to himself.

840
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:02,220
We was made a real good running at him.

841
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,240
I was getting evicted soon.

842
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,660
Too much damn hesitation.

843
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,300
And as he's saying hesitation, he looks up

844
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,940
and sees what's happening in the distance

845
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,180
for the first time.

846
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,100
And he just stops cold.

847
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:21,100
And you all hear a slight chant song,

848
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,780
reverberating from the other side

849
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,660
of this towering dark buildings.

850
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,580
And the first time you've gotten close enough

851
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:31,500
to hear behind this building,

852
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:36,060
the power of these voices, a chorus hits you

853
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,200
like the sound of cascading waters

854
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,300
and like the rumbling of loud thunder.

855
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:49,180
Shock tea for leecha, shock tea for leecha,

856
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:53,060
shock tea for leecha, shock tea for leecha,

857
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:57,080
shock tea for leecha, shock tea for leecha,

858
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,440
shock tea for leecha, for the overseer.

859
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,040
Shock tea for leecha.

860
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,540
For the overseer, shock tea for leecha,

861
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,320
For the overseer, shock tea for leecha,

862
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:15,740
For the overseer, shock tea for leecha.

863
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,300
And Clark, you recognize this sound.

864
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,800
My theme song.

865
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,620
That's right.

866
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,180
It's the music that plays at the end of Wheel of Fortune.

867
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,820
Wait, really?

868
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:34,940
Is the Wheel of Fortune end song a banger?

869
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,140
Yes, it 100 million percent is.

870
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,060
Yes, it is.

871
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,020
I'll have to check that out.

872
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,300
I'll have that to a few playlists.

873
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,100
Fun dance times, number three.

874
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,300
Intimate home moments.

875
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,500
Wheel of Fortune end theme.

876
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,940
And this huge mass of people

877
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:56,220
begins walking in a circle

878
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,020
from around one side of the building.

879
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:01,200
You see two circles of people,

880
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,440
a bigger circle and an inner circle,

881
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,460
the outer circle going clockwise,

882
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,620
the inner circle moving counterclockwise

883
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,340
as they're chanting this song.

884
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:13,540
And you recognize there's a bunch of people dressed

885
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,760
like they're from the Old West in old timey clothing.

886
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:22,600
Some of them have friend branded across their foreheads.

887
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,160
And every single person who is in either the inner

888
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,440
or outer circle chanting this song,

889
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,800
they're all holding an animal

890
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,620
or have an animal right alongside them.

891
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,620
So with some of these Old West people,

892
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,400
you see a guy who looks like a bartender,

893
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,160
a guy who looks like a piano player,

894
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,640
a guy who looks like a gambler named Thomas.

895
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,480
They're each holding a raccoon, a chunky kitty,

896
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,480
and a handsome black dog.

897
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,760
The Critter Coalition.

898
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,900
You see Everett Pace,

899
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:58,120

900
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,520
on one of his shoulders.

901
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,380
You see Jack Pearlman.

902
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,520
Thank you.

903
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:15,440
He's got an old, chunky, proud chipmunk on his shoulder

904
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,680
named Chip Montgomery.

905
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,640
You see Professor Horace Green,

906
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,760
who doesn't have an animal.

907
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,160
He has the decapitated head of Preacher Sheriff

908
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,000
Dr. Bobby Custard in his hand.

909
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,440
See Drew Andrews' body with an excitable black lab

910
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,620
named Tyler.

911
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:36,920
You see Darry Daly dressed to the fucking nines

912
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,720
with a golden retriever by his side.

913
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,640
Keith, you recognize your dog being immediately.

914
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,600
Harry Klinker right next to him,

915
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:50,000
also chanting, dressed in his classic bar uniform.

916
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,540
He's got an old, handsome, gray dog with him.

917
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:58,400
Mildred Mitchell is there with her rainbow earrings,

918
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,960
and she has an old gray squirrel in her hands.

919
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,760
See Jimmy Sanders, drug rug included,

920
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,000
and he's got a possum with him named Common.

921
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,080
Drug rug?

922
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,400
Does he not wear a drug rug?

923
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,680
Oh, is that what those hippie ponchos are called?

924
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,160
Yeah.

925
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,440
That's what I've always called them.

926
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,920
Yeah.

927
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,280
Yeah, I can buy it.

928
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,240
I was there with you, Zach.

929
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,320
I like it.

930
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,920
I get it, yeah.

931
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,840
You call them ketamine coveralls.

932
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,520
You see Councilwoman Carrie Page's body,

933
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,920
who you know to have Drew Andrews inside,

934
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,140
holding Salem the cat's body,

935
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,480
who you know has Agent Trinchad inside.

936
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,960
You see most of the town of contention

937
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,880

938
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,160
from the Contention Critter, fuck me,

939
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,460
Contention Critter Coalition.

940
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,640
And you see people from every era since forever

941
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,200
with other animals from other eras.

942
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,340
Are there dinosaur?

943
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,040
Are there dinosaur?

944
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:04,880
Yeah.

945
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,700
Great question.

946
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,040
No, are there a dinosaur?

947
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,120
Answer.

948
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,280
Are there a dinosaur?

949
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,600
Are there a dinosaur?

950
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,440
Are there a dinosaur?

951
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,160
We all know humans and dinosaurs co-existed, so.

952
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,240
Are there has-been of a dinosaur in here?

953
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,320
There are any contention dinosaurs?

954
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,640
From a long time ago.

955
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:24,420
I was just teaching my students is R, plural and singular,

956
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,200
and I used farts as an example.

957
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,120
We were learning the word disgusting,

958
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,440
so I asked one of them what's disgusting,

959
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,280
and they said farts.

960
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,740
What's disgusting is you haven't answered

961
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,120
if there was a dinosaur or not.

962
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,920
Yeah, are there a dinosaur there?

963
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,220
That's fair, okay.

964
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,060
I'm gonna assume, yeah.

965
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,100
No, there's not a fucking dinosaur there.

966
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,580
You said animals from all times.

967
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:47,240
Professor Horace Green raises his hand,

968
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,960
and he's like, actually, the whole area

969
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,300
was an inland ocean in those times.

970
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,720
There was never any dinosaurs here.

971
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,420
But there was my beloved mosasaurus.

972
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,740
And you do see a mosasaurus,

973
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:01,140
which is kind of like a crocodile whale,

974
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,820
fall out of the sky and die gasping for air.

975
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:06,780
There's the one.

976
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,780
There's the one.

977
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,800
We brought one dinosaur.

978
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,640
It's dead.

979
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:15,100
It's not a dinosaur, but it's contemporaneous.

980
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,700
Yeah, I know big words too.

981
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:21,820
I don't.

982
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,660
I shouldn't lie like that.

983
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,900
Sorry, I've read books, Justin.

984
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,040
But are you Red Book?

985
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:27,880
Are you Red Book?

986
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,040
Are you Red Book?

987
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:34,040
["Bad Girls on Top of the Water"]

988
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,960
Bad girls on top of the water

989
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,120
Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline

990
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:47,240
Leaving my mind at your altar

991
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,360
Crossing the double line

992
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,920
Doing it every time

993
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:55,920
Tell me what kind of world are you living in

994
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,680
What kind of world are you living in

995
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:09,680
What kind of world are you living in

996
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:29,680
What kind of world are you living in

997
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,680
What kind of world are you living in
