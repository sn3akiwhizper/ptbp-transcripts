{"text": " what's up my babies it's your stepdad's stepson wolf wolf the dog's dog taking over the airwaves here on 694.2 PTBP due to a frankly terrifying display of holiday cheer aka wolf the dog gargled down more steaming mollusks swapped than the rest of family combined in our semi-annual chowder challenge oh wolf is in the dumpster and he's breathing but it's real high-pitched now it is something to do called howling with wolf so how does the man who drives the snow plow get to work in the morning next is a non-sequitur transition into fucking Mark Zuckerberg but for real help my fake dad out talk about app pretending part on the internet and give them money on patreon sometimes people write five star reviews on the apple podcast app and he gets so happy because he feels validated and understood and that means a lot to dogs like wolf now put down the booze and listen for clues it's time for the news last time Leon told Clark that he would become the overseer go back in time and start the circle of knowledge Leon split the party tried to shoot Clark with a dart gun got fucked by Joel's uncanny ability to quit and then Leon Clark came to an understanding fulfilling their original plan the two headed over to the administration building where they heard numbers coming from a voice at the end of a dark hallway Keith and John went to Harriet Mox's dorm John last touched again and focused on the Bruce Robin numbers while Keith scoured Harriet's room for clues turns out Harriet's roommate Amelia thinks the suicide story is fishy and Harriet was on search for two things the most corrupt corporation in the city and the overseer and now to the middle of a party timed holiday themed storyline even when Clark is being a dick it's a track that makes my ball drop welcome to 2020 motherfuckers it's kazoo with no back boom girth knife baby girth knife she's so girthy girth knife baby girth no she's so girthy girthy so joe clark bishop is walking down this hallway i actually decided to go the other way yep that makes a lot of sense so when you turn back the other way you find Cthulhu ah dang it i'll go the other way okay yeah that makes sense so as you're walking down toward the office you see these two figures in the distance and as you come up on them you see that one is very short and very slight in stature and also slender and the small one is uh jumping up and poking at the other figure who is played by Justin hi yeah what is he what does your character look like Justin six one six two kind of tall dark nice hair he's a he you can tell he takes care of his appearance he's dressed up quite nicely all right and this little fella is just like jumping up and poking you in the chest over and over and he's just like oh come on please hit me god please just hit me in the face i'm gonna i'm gonna need you to stop right now please oh gosh i would love to four if you just any mumble some other words and is like please just hit me hit me hit me oh god if you don't i'll have to do it to myself i i grab him and i shake him and i go i'm not yeah just like that no yeah i'm not gonna touch your skin with my skin you're doing it right now no okay oh and then he like uh he runs over to one of the walls nearby and just starts like slamming his head into the wall oh jesus and he starts hollering he's like it's not the same it's not the same when i do it and clark bishop and uh leon simpson walk up into that can i get a uh sense of age from of these two people are they students can i tell yeah they seem to be students uh the shorter ones looks to be a young looking freshman in college and i look to be in my early 20s let's say let's say and then it's true once you say that's how role-playing works yeah i walk up to you the well-dressed one who's not slamming his head against the wall it's not as good sir can you what what's happening hold on give me one moment sir and he's looking up at this banner outside the administration office and it's like hanging over uh these windows looking into the office and the banner says at the end of the 10th day my true love had given me blank gifts and it's uh capital g i f f s and leon looks up at it and he's like oh the administration office it's right there is the banner handwritten no no it is well made and it is in a very uh festive font it's uh is it uh it's not the same when i do it myself oh hi there sir and he this little guy walks up to you and he's like will you please hit me oh god just please just like punch me punch me punch me punch me punch me i don't i don't want to do that to you what about you and he looks at leon leon's like i don't do you know is this door i'm just gonna check and walks over and the administration office is unlocked so leon just like opens the door and turns back and he's like oh come on come on please just like one good punch why do you want me to hit you god love it but why with my with my body like every single inch of me just wants and needs you to hit me please four three oh god just hit me please why are you saying those those numbers numbers i punch him hey yay as this kid falls to the ground he's just like yeah thank you thank you for that i can get back to these puzzles i'm trying to solve why was your friend acting so it's crazy like that i just stare back at the sign again completely ignoring i look up at the sign it was received tim gifts at the end of the 10th day my true love had given me blank gifts oh um i can i can do that oh shit i can't do that because i don't remember how high it goes 13 is it 13 days of christmas sir will you please that one was really good but if you could just send me right over the top leon looks at you and is like ah should i he was saying numbers that's why yeah i'll punch him too and just like fucking slams him in the face and the kid falls to the ground is like yeah oh yeah oh thank you sir and just like scrambles off and dips into the darkness of the corridor and runs away oh shit how did he look after the both of those hits do we like bloody him ecstatic and also yeah bloody yeah yeah a trail of uh this little boy's 18 year old boy's blood is that bad we established college age everyone's 18 on this podcast from here on out leaves a trail of his boy blood i look i look back at the well-dressed one like what the hell why did he want us to hit him i honestly have no idea he would not stop asking me did you know him before just i have no idea who this person was well all right but i thank you from the bottom of my heart for striking him multiple times you're not thinking of numbers right now are you what are you talking about okay just just checking you're not thinking of numbers at all and you guys look down and you see like leon had flipped on the lights in the office when the lights come on you see that the walls of the hallway and the office are just covered in numbers oh shit the entire inner workings of this building have just been like chalk sharpie pen blood semen everything just like yeah semen and then everything have been used to write numbers all over these walls and the floor and the ceiling i uh look a little scared at the well-dressed guy you didn't write any of these did you i didn't even know these were here until that guy flipped the lights on what are you doing here son what's your name what are you doing here my name is donovan west haven oh hey donovan i'm leon nice to meet you what are you doing here oh i'm trying to uh i'm trying to solve this riddle you can see it up on this uh banner up here why it's the christmas i don't remember it's the christmas i don't remember huh and then he like literally looks to the bottom right of the banner and there is a logo for the jingle ball hosted by csu the jingle ball it's a holiday episode at pretending to be people where the tinkling music comes in justin it's whatever i'll figure whatever our normal logo is now has christmas lights hanging off of each letter oh that's adorable and all the scary music is now um it all has like nice little bells and yes honestly just only sleigh bells that's the only difference just got this constant jingling in the background which might be more horrifying we're trading out carpenter for williams the jingling never stops clark looks up at that banner that's just uh that's just the number plus them all so if it's the 10th day it's 10 gifts and the day before that they would have gotten nine just add them all up i think it's carry the one is 55 i think i think it's 55 i don't know yeah you have to do what now you're the first day your lover gave you a partridge in a pear tree sure second day gave you two something two french hens two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree what is this from oh does she give you the all the gifts again and then on the third day it's three something or others and then two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree right am i singing the song right you're singing the song right i just figured that each day she was given the extra new gift she wasn't repeating the previous day's gifts every time if that's the case the math's a lot higher i mean i it could be higher i i don't know i'm i'm more should we go in the office yeah i just i think that's the answer to the question on the banner yeah let's go in the office i turned to the well-dressed guy uh you have a you have a pleasant pleasant day sir can you tell me what that number was again i've forgotten already i think it's 55 but if leon's right this is leon by the way hi leon hey donovan hi if leon's correct the number would be a lot higher and i don't have the time to do the math right now on it which seems like an outrageous number of presence and i thought the first number was an outrageous number that lady loves that guy clark you're not doing christmas right and he walks into the office uh with the lights on you see that the everything in this office is covered in numbers uh the desks the chairs like anything that people could possibly write on are covered in these numbers and he walks over to a computer weirdly enough there's just one main computer in this office space and there is a monitor and keyboard normal computer stuff leon looks at it and is like all right well i guess let's boot it up and there's a passcode to get in any ideas leon i mean and he starts rifling through the desk looking around the area you see that there are pictures sitting at this desk of a woman she seems to be in her early 20s same as donovan what was that last name donovan west haven all right similar age of donovan west haven and you see that the pictures are with trophies from scavenger hunt championships with this person holding trophies up and you see the name engraved on the trophies is amelia lock l o c k e with an e and then there's also a group photo of a lot of girls who seem to be 18 19 years old as well as this nice and uh the frame on this picture says best r a ever and they're all holding up a sign that says third floor gifts house which is g i f f s space house let me let me try something here leon and i'm gonna try lock l o c k e as a password it does not work i'm gonna try amelia it does not work i'm gonna try amelia lock it does not work okay well we've exhausted all of our options yep we're done here so clark i think what we we might need to just find this amelia lock and then convince her to unlock this computer no no no we're gonna we're just gonna sit here and guess until we get it okay sounds good what's your next guess uh zero zero zero one okay that one didn't work zero zero zero two i tried that one as well zero zero zero three okay i think we're on to something you're locked out for the next uh hour ah shit should have should have thought of that oh we didn't even try password oh we definitely should have tried password it was password it was either password or guest admin you really fucked up admin one two three go ahead and roll alertness for me okay i pass a 21 on a 70 you notice that on the opposite side from where you were standing outside with donovan in the hallway from the vantage of inside the office you see that there's actually some stuff printed on the back of the banner is a map of campus and the four dorm have their names listed and the dorms are called maymay house tinder's house redight house and gifs house uh will you go ahead and just spell those for my own sanity yeah maymay is m-a-y-m-a-y tinder's is t-y-n-e-d-e-r-s redight is r-e-e-d-i-g-h-t and gifs is g-i-f-f-s those are hella some names yeah those are some hells of some names uh hey uh leon this uh this this picture here with amelia it looks like it's the the gifs the gifs house that's if you want to find amelia i think there's a red spot are we sure there aren't any paper records in here though i mean we might just be able to thumb through the files yeah we absolutely could and you look and see that all of the file cabinets have locks on them well i know dag nab i mean we could like blow them up or i don't know like we shoot the locks on them or how pressed for time do you feel we are leon do you want to go on a scavenger hunt like amelia here likes and find amelia or should we donna our business here oh yeah yeah how hard are these scavenger hunts usually i mean for me extremely hard but i uh i don't know everyone else seems to be a genius at this university i don't know do you want to go to the jingle ball any any help i could get to do this i need i need this win guys i need it i mean yeah we can uh we can go on a scavenger hunt i guess you know people's lives are in the balance here right leon i mean that's people's lives are always in the balance clark sometimes you just got to do a scavenger hunt for a holiday episode if i don't solve if if i don't solve this scavenger hunt i will literally die emotionally not physically oh donovan the stakes you just raised them to the right level for old clark to get involved i'm gonna need you to take it down a notch clark i'm sorry i'm sorry i just got excited that you needed help and i'm here to help you and we're gonna we're gonna solve this uh scavenger hunt then okay calm down clark you just see important leon's eyes are big and he looks at you and he's like look at you saving people sometimes it feels like it's what i was meant to do all right well let's go to either 55 or 330 gifts house yeah i mean i think mine's correct but if you think that she's giving all those presents every day let's go to yours so when you guys walking across campus it is again a ghost campus there's nobody out and about you hear some like just like for you know just like normal noises from across campus just like some creepy noises not to dissuade your foley work because that was wonderful thank you but was it all obviously emitted by a human or is there some of those that are actual animal noises at least one of those was an owl okay it wasn't the one that sounded like an owl that was a person and you guys make it over to gifts house unobstructed and when you get in there you see there's a little secretary desk on the right and the sitting area on the left with a baby grand piano and then ahead of you there is a glass wall with a door there and all the lights are out by the way nobody's sitting at that nobody is sitting at the receptionist desk the uh the lonely glow of the computer there is shining onto an empty chair behind it clark is just going to point at the computer and i'm motioning for leon hey leon you want to check on that and clark is going to go like to is there a staircase in here so when you walk forward past the desk you would see there's hallways on either side of you and there are doors with like the little stairwell markings on both sides right or left well i just kind of clark just wants to yell down if there's nobody around hello anybody anybody here roll an alertness for me justin you want to roll some dice yeah roll an alertness for me i bet you have like a 60 in an alertness uh yeah i rolled two d-10s they aren't he doesn't even know which dice to roll hey joe hey joe shut your fucking mouth it's so dark in here i failed failed oh wait wait wait is a double a uh crit fail that's beautiful i i failed also not a crit though perfect well uh as you're just like stumbling around in the darkness donovan walks over into a hallway that is an offshoot from the bigger hallway that leads to the stairwell and the light comes on you see that the walls on either side of you are just covered in these numbers and like there's some sigils posted up now and it's just some sigils sigils yeah and it's all written in the same just like varying materials as soon as the lights come on you just hear from a door in this hallway there are three doors in this hallway and from inside one of them you hear no no no five six four five five five six no no the door cracks open and you just hear please turn out the lights oh my god donovan slowly shuts the lights backs away thank you and the door shuts real quick there's silence you're you're welcome hey donovan come back this way this let's stay away from that uh that area there real fast i think that's a good idea donovan i i know you didn't ask for this but there's a chance that we're wrapped up in something real bad here and those numbers might be infectious so if you hear numbers you might close your ears or maybe don't look at them i'm not sure how it works hey leon you know how this thing transfers he doesn't respond and when you look over at him he's actually wearing his noise canceling headphones ah fuck i tap him on the shoulder oh he startled looks over at you and he points at the computer screen and he's pulled up the room number for amelia lock amelia lock she lives in 328 gifts house and her roommate is harriet marks ah it's all coming together you notice when you turn back around the glass panel of windows looking into a separate room uh the glint of the uh computer screen kind of shines over there enough for you to make out a pool table in that room you assume it's some sort of entertainment or games room there's probably nothing fucked up in there hey leon leon he takes the headphones off and he's like yeah i'm just trying to you know protection from the numbers right yeah you got a couple extra pairs of those well you seem already fucked and this one's a dumb dumb so should be fine you think i'm already fucked well that's why we're here right to fix what happened to you i mean i feel like we snapped out of it didn't we we're not we're i'm not saying numbers now am i you're not right now we'll see about that i don't know maybe i've been inoculated maybe that's what happened here maybe maybe since i've already done the numbers thing and you snapped me out of it you snapped all of us out of it maybe i don't have numbers in me anymore i hope that that's true all right boy it seems like you don't know as much as i thought you might have known about all this donovan how many numbers have you been privy to yeah there's been uh people keep uh shouting numbers at me constantly it's really annoying actually i don't do you have blackouts or gaps in your memory in the last few days or no no feeling pretty good actually a little hungry peckish i look at leon i mean maybe he's the thing we're looking for he's sounds like you might be immune to it or something i don't i'm a man not a thing joe clark joe clark i'm sorry donnie i uh i accept your apology this time just don't do it again i did mean to dehumanize you because you might be an antidote of some sort that we need your blood or oh my god yes that's that's fucking brilliant what's happening nothing uh you'll just want to stay with us we have to protect him sure i was already doing that were you not oh shit leon i just mean like it's a priority now gotcha yeah i sure i definitely was protecting him before donovan is staring at his phone like swiping through whatever social media exists in this universe completely oblivious to you talking about him right next to him what's going on dude yeah i think we're gonna we're gonna go up to amelia's room now i think is the yeah that works for me yeah stairs yeah whatever will get me to the prize i own the prize that's right donny you got a real tiger spirit i'm gonna need you to not call me donny again mr westworth yeah no yeah no you can call me donovan that's what everyone calls me even my mom all right donovan thank you did he sound like your mom when he said that let's go and he uh he starts walking towards the stairs when you get into the stairwell it's also pitch black and it is lit up a little red with the exit sign right across from you as you walk in there's an there's a door outside from here as well and when you walk into the third floor we'll find out what you see later oh shit this is where we where we stop being here and boys do other things other where we'll see what happens other where other where's the things are about to happen you guys don't exist to me anymore blip out yeah you do you do you do everyone exists thomas i have good news and bad news just give me the good news then okay the good news is it's almost christmas yeah i'm looking forward to um i mean it's it's always nice this time of year when the podcast gets around to the gameplay sure and i'm really looking forward to three or four years from now when we get to december 25th in an actual game world yeah so we've been recording for two years releasing for a year and we've made it all the way from december 1st to december 6th what a week and way back in the past and then way back in the future past yeah i bet we'll make it by the end of tonight all the way to christmas to christmas all the way to christmas spoilers hey i have to tell you the bad news okay john lee pettimore is gaining a new mania and it is going to completely engross him oh he didn't reach his breaking point i know he didn't but it's a part of a mechanic for this arc that this mania will absolutely dominate every other mania that you've had before and every role-playing decision that you make so it's going to be kind of important and i hope you roll well so you're going to roll three d 100s and we'll look at the list and see what you got 94 okay keep rolling 89 oh that's a good one i bet sounds like it yeah it's high 99 whoa jesus all right so 94 is theomania belief that he or she is a god i think maybe we've got a winner right off the bat yeah if you can get me back in a room with joe oh we've got another really good one 89 is scribbleomania an obsession with scribbling or doodling interesting that's really really appropriate and then 99 is xenomania which is an obsession with foreign things i'm gonna choose theo philia or thea what was it theomania you love god i love god what was it theomania theomania belief that he or she is a god there's two gods in this role-playing game now and that's not counting any of the elders uh something older than me older than john lee pettymore himself as far as we know i'm ageless i came out of a spine as a little ball i can do anything i am planet juggernaut and i am your god hell yeah it's important in delta green to really give people a sense of hero worship over their own character yeah let's get into it so i know we're past christmas but we still have a lot of holiday traditions that take place around the end of december and the beginning of january or mostly the in between therefore of the two situations with which we call calendar months within a year into the next one but i was wondering what your guys's favorite family traditions are from the holiday season no i don't want to tell you you're gonna make it something scary i'm gonna make it something so scary yeah i don't trust like that justin i've always said that you should trust more yeah i just don't though and that hurts how can zack manipulate you it's really fucking hard to gaslight you when you don't trust the words i say justin i'm sorry zack when i was a kid we used to listen to a song uh when we were hanging out the ornaments on the tree we'd always listen to christmas music and one of our favorites was a muppet christmas carol soundtrack to that movie it was great but my personal favorite growing up was a song by john denver this isn't a joke this is just true it he has a song called merry christmas little zachary oh that's you and it made my heart warm did you know he died yes yeah he's dead we made it scary for you and now every time i hear it i can only so when i when i heard the song as a child i could always immediately visualize john denver's face wherever he was in the world but now i just see his rotting corpse which is cool and festive but it's not you know what i'm looking for so i had to stop listening to that song you just think of this instead luke is just handed oh my god dude stop it it's a it's a picture of john denver's plane crash that's not his it's just a plane crash it's wildly inappropriate merry christmas everybody other than the normal like christmas morning stuff that i absolutely love we have a weird tradition in the family that christmas eve we do a frozen pizza and oyster soup that is interesting very weird so the frozen pizzas i think comes from my mom and they've just chalked it up as like not wanting to cook the night before christmas okay and then i think my dad maybe brought the oysters no that might have been hers also but the oyster soup is like a really great fancy oyster soup that my dad makes and it's great great great and it's really weird to have them together and i love it yeah it doesn't sound good it's weird and it's i don't know if i could recommend it but i it's a christmas memory yeah what do you guys do while you're having this like weird dichotomous meal it's with family friends instead of family it's the it i i i do sunday suppers with a bunch of people that i've done since i was a voice changer when you said that because it's so wholesome and sweet he's a little he's a little child and it's that group i get together with that group for that christmas eve that's fun yeah i like that justin what's your family do on uh my family is weird because we don't do jack shit on christmas we do everything on christmas eve and we do an all like homemade italian meal oh hell yeah this is my grandparents who immigrated from argentina in argentina it's like a ton of italian food so they just uh we just wonder why that is because there's a lot of italian stuff luke do you need anything for christmas uh we uh christmas lunch and it's like a bunch of appetizers like little smokies and meatballs oh nice yeah and also so uh my family for christmas um my stepmom will always make uh fresh cinnamon rolls oh and then we drink mimosas yeah it's justin hasn't been on mike in a while you know you learned to not sneeze oh god have you seen that video of trump getting pissed off with the guy who sneezes anyway we don't need to talk about monsters on this show it's it's christmas it's time to think about pleasant things not real horror yeah um and then uh my step sister who like uh is a chef she went to culinary school and everything oh credentials she makes us these dope eggs benedict damn hell yeah it's a lot of fun that's awesome we get sloshed and we eat cinnamon rolls and eggs benedict dude that's how this wins that's incredible we're all coming over okay done all right so you guys are all standing in different places so clark bishop and donovan westerfuck are walking down the hallway of the third floor of the gifts building gifts house as you're walking down that hallway you see that the light is on in one of the rooms down the hallway and looking at the numbers you would see like oh that that might actually be the one that we're looking for the 328 number and when you arrive there you find keith vigna and john lee pettymore standing in room 328 of diff's house uh is leon with us oh yeah i'm here for sure always been here never not clark just knocks on the door jam fell fellas oh hey uh hey clark john like turns with a start and sees you and sees where he is and he's like it is true i can anything i want i'm right there what hello hey i'm glad you snapped out of it snap snapped out of it what more like snapped into it uh did you guys take the elevator up here uh i believe we took the stairs didn't we uh well there's a dead body in the elevator and he saw it and he started uh he just kind of blanked out and started writing uh bruce robbins the the code for bruce robbins numbers again yeah maybe that's what it seemed like i dragged him along with me corporeal form dead but yeah well john were you writing were you writing numbers did you ever feel did you ever feel immense period period question mark immense i mean i've been working out some but you are looking a little camille right now topical weeks from now of course you wouldn't understand um welcome to the to the room everyone you guys i think i brought you all here you guys would notice that they are with a third person so keith vigna and john lee pennymore you are seeing donovan for the first time and he looks like what justin's about to say donovan west haven is about six foot one six foot two somewhere in between those two inches dark nice hair done up really nice and he has like a let's see he's like a button-up buttoned all the way up tucked in he's a handsome boy who are you an adult boy just to be make sure we all know that he's an adult who's this clark guys this is this is donovan donovan this is the fellas that's john over there and that's uh keith there i shake your hand i'm like donovan i've known you all your life donovan doesn't shake he nods at you and's like hi what's up we ran into this guy like nod and smile over in the uh the administration building me and leon think there's a chance he's immune to these numbers he's been here on campus in the middle of what you're saying john lee pettymore walks straight into a wall like slams into it yeah john john no i'm still working up the kinks don't worry i've got it all in my hands oh god okay keith what were you saying though sorry has he been like this for a while i mean he was no longer than you know he was normal until we saw that body then he started writing on the walls and now i don't know what the fuck he's doing do you do you keith have any missing time in your no okay who's this guy his name's donovan we ran into him we think that he might be immune to the the infection of the numbers he said he's been having people yelling at him numbers all for the last few days a few days yeah and he seems to have no ill effects he doesn't he doesn't affect other people i mean it affected us have any other do you know any other students it's been affecting oh like um all of them except me okay we actually ran into him he had another fellow with him who was asking to be punched in the face and then he started saying numbers so i obliged well we found a we found a body in the elevator uh dead um i didn't investigate too much on it but uh nearly moved on to the next phase i kind of look at john and eyebrows high john smiles benevolently at you i didn't investigate it too much but uh it could have been self-inflicted i'm not really sure were there were there numbers on or around the body i mean there's numbers all in this you look around the room and the room itself is also covered in these numbers as was the hallway on the way down the floor the ceiling all over the desk the chair all over the place in here from what i'm gathering from leon here he's not even 100 sure the uh method of infection but he puts on headphones every now and then just to maybe combat the that's not not a bad idea so the only thing i've found obviously you know we're in harriet's room uh we found out her her roommate's name is amelia amelia lock amelia lock yeah have you seen this and i hold up the flyer for the ball yeah do you uh do you know about the scavenger hunt yeah but i haven't really found anything out about it but uh if you look over there and i point to amelia's desk take a look at those trophies i do you would see that they are trophies for being an elite riddle master and a scavenger hunt champion oh yeah so we we found i found her desk at the administration's office oh yeah and uh i saw some pictures of her holding these trophies here um there was also a clue back at those offices i assume maybe the first clue what was it it uh basically asked how many presents does a person get on the 10th day of christmas and me and leon have differing opinions on that number but either way it's just a number i don't know if it well well i would say 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 and 1 thank you thank you keith thank you john exactly leon uh i'm just saying i just can take my answer on this is fairly authoritative i don't understand are you really good at math amongst other things you there what was his name donovan what was his last name west haven west fucker west mr wet fucker why do you think mr wet fucker you there child your voice got weird mr char mr west fucker are you do you hear yeah what's up why do you think the numbers had no effect on you i couldn't tell you honestly i don't know tell me i'm just maybe you know it just like i know it tell me maybe i'm maybe i'm special after all ah yes i can see it in you you are special you are very special more than you know child is john speaking with an accent have you noticed i don't know i mean he wasn't acting like this before your friends are weird and they're freaking me out so leon here thinks that every day she's repeating the presents from the previous day i don't no i don't think that i think it'd be 110 the only the only leg he has to stand on is that she does say on the fifth day christmas my true love hey out of character think about who made this puzzle and then and then who do you think has the right but i also i agree with that you get all the presents each day right you get all the presents the true love is a real true love well if that's the case then look at this also 330 is the room right next to us it's the room right across the hall and keith vigno holds up a sheet and on the back of the sheet is all the math of like one plus three plus you know essentially uh fibonacci sequence but not right for this thing and it leads to 330 which is the room across the hall which keith vigno would then say i found this in there and i hold up another piece of paper you guys fucking nailed it we got there i hold up a piece of paper that has a picture like in cartoon form a picture of seven eggs a golf ball a cat a demon and another egg yep uh yeah there was nothing in there beside it was just a normal it's like we found out it's a like a staging dorm room that nobody lives in it's just to show prospective students what a dorm room looks like i found this in there and there's a casio keyboard in there too does that mean anything to you casio keyboard it doesn't mean anything no no it doesn't mean anything to me either but i can tell you whoever made this riddle seems very cool you a puzzle fan leon oh huge puzzle fan i'm glad you're here with us then do these look like emojis from the movie yeah exactly are these emojis from the emoji movie i don't know if there are yeah essentially they're this of similar ilk in style but they're not emojis i don't think so right no i'm not there i just mean like they're not like it's not made out of emojis they're like cartoons they're like cartoons they're uh illustrations cool like pictogram they could be small enough to be sent in text form though does that make it an emoji no man oh okay then no definitively no it was seven eggs a golf ball a cat i saw seven eggs a demon and an egg when you say demon can you describe that demon is it like the demon emoji yeah it looks like the demon like is it horns is that what it has yep okay purple with horns baby and a little toothy smile that one's an emoji uh just a couple other things before i don't know if i mean we ought to probably go check that room out but uh in harriet's desk she has a to-do list number one research the most unethical corporation in the city and number two just said who is the overseer and then uh in in uh i know amelia's desk uh she had a little note i found and basically says she didn't think that harriet would have committed suicide and that she's going to try to get to the bottom of it and that's what i found in here so far so previously we were thinking that maybe it was a uh a leaping disease that went from one person to the next and he wrote down their names and yada yada if harriet killed herself first then amelia would have maybe gotten it or gotten it in investigating her death that could be have we seen amelia's name written anywhere in these numbers and i do a quick look around at the actual numbers and see if i can find her name in the numbers nice roll search i pass an eight 20 you find a couple numbers that start with one but none of them move to whatever m is next what about her last name just lock can't find it anywhere okay yeah i'm just not sure if our if our theory is wrong or something else happened in the sequence of events here but donovan what do you think i gotta get that jingle ball i need it you mean you have to get to the jingle ball yeah whatever i just want to win whatever donovan do they give out an actual jingle ball at the jingle ball if you make it there last maybe that was really rude of you yeah sick burn leon yeah what what the hell he's not children children i look at both of you like with a right smile but like paternal love i am unsettled as long as you're quiet young man holy shit and quiet he is jesus you see john lee pettymore is beaming at you with fraternal pride do you think we ought to go back into 330 see if you guys might find something i didn't so yeah i'd like to so beautiful put my eyes on that room for sure i'll head across the hall so when you guys go across the hall into 330 you would find this dorm room set up to be the pinnacle of what all dorm rooms could look like here at csu come on down become one of the fighting plant things can't remember it what's it called fly trap and well what if it was the fighting for cithias oh i like that a lot feed me see more and there's a lot of things that we can offer you here at csu much like this dorm room that is very well equipped with lots of blankets and pillows and athleisure which is what the college kids wearing these days bad commercial for csu but uh you would see that all over this room there are numbers thickly written i mean to the point where it's hard to make out the sequences just like everywhere else however in the middle of this room there is just a casio keyboard sitting there it's turned on and there's a music stand that is now empty i'd like to play the keyboard cat riff oh you do it can you do it it just kind of goes on right john does it though does the pictogram symbols do they end with a single egg yes i picked this up off that music stand and the symbols are on a staff on a music staff yes oh is it in the form of e g c d e it's written just across the music staff it's no up or down okay but we might assume one might assume a guess might be it's the guess that was clearly being made there i want to hit those notes that are the first letters of the words of the pictures e justin can you take that live for us wow she is majestic wait does that keyboard that keyboard does not have an outboard audio on it but we could pause and go to the piano real quick i'd like to hear it let's take a pause and go to the upright piano real quick joe hammered down those notes that he got and keep in mind my dad is a professional piano player so it only took us about 45 minutes to practice one it's four in the morning we're all dying but assuming the first letter of egg golf ball cat demon and egg represents musical notes it might sound a little bit something like this and as g vigna or clark bishop are all of you with your hands all together just doing it like the cat did on the keyboard as you play the jingle bells tune you all the camera like pans through you none of us thought to not do this and no it's nice you look through the window and you see right out the window of 330 gifts house you see the bell tower on the csu campus lit up in all its holiday festive glory are there wreaths dude you have no idea how many wreaths there are you can't count them are there lights because you can only see two sides of it and there are so many lights but you don't know how many lights is there a minion inflatable there's a minion inflatable right on top it's actually using it like a butt plug and trees and trees cool we got it all baby here at csu come on down and join us for your next semester of fun and fall festivities that can take you all the way from the jingle ball to a new hall of your new office which is where you work now because you've got a college degree and it's america which is all you need to work in the system that is in place to keep you down csu come on down get kept down
