00:00.000 --> 00:02.160
Welcome, my brood.

00:02.160 --> 00:06.400
It is I, Wolf the Dog, DJ of the Year,

00:06.400 --> 00:10.320
and I set upon many eggs to birth all of you

00:10.320 --> 00:14.840
so that you may be my lifelong loyal listeners.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.220
I think, maybe that was a dream.

00:17.220 --> 00:20.560
Ever since I started eating grease too close to Betty

00:20.560 --> 00:25.200
by time, I've been dreaming up all kinds of crazy shit.

00:25.200 --> 00:28.920
And oh yeah, I'm the host of this here radio show.

00:28.920 --> 00:33.920
Y'all find yourselves tuned into 694.2 PTBP.

00:35.440 --> 00:39.560
All I ask from my hatchlings is for a little love,

00:39.560 --> 00:43.960
maybe a little forehead kiss, or some fan mail.

00:43.960 --> 00:48.080
And hey, would you look at what we got here, y'all?

00:48.080 --> 00:51.160
This episode's Howlin' with Wolf is from Eric

00:51.160 --> 00:53.680
in Jersey City, New Jersey,

00:53.680 --> 00:56.840
who tagged at Pretending Pod on the internet.

00:56.880 --> 00:59.640
Well done, my good and faithful Eric

00:59.640 --> 01:03.120
in Jersey City, New Jersey, Eric writes.

01:03.120 --> 01:06.560
Looking for a little more spookiness in your life?

01:06.560 --> 01:09.720
Check out The Nature of My Game podcast,

01:09.720 --> 01:13.400
a story-focused actual play of investigation,

01:13.400 --> 01:15.600
strangeness, and fear.

01:15.600 --> 01:20.600
Each season of the show features a new horror-themed RPG,

01:20.920 --> 01:24.020
a new cast, and a new story.

01:24.020 --> 01:29.020
And soon, we'll be kicking off a Yellow King RPG campaign,

01:29.140 --> 01:32.540
playing the yet-to-be-released Casilda song

01:32.540 --> 01:34.560
from Pelgrain Press.

01:34.560 --> 01:36.860
Listen to The Nature of My Game

01:36.860 --> 01:39.380
wherever you get your podcasts,

01:39.380 --> 01:44.180
and a huge thanks to PTBP for the inspiration.

01:44.180 --> 01:48.540
Well, New Jersey Eric, I'm glad that my radio show

01:48.540 --> 01:51.180
could be of inspiration to ya,

01:51.180 --> 01:54.700
although I'm not too sure what a RPG is

01:54.700 --> 01:57.500
or what an actual play is.

01:57.500 --> 02:00.480
Are there theoretical play podcasts?

02:00.480 --> 02:02.820
Damn, metaphysical ones.

02:02.820 --> 02:06.240
I gotta start listening to these damn things someday.

02:06.240 --> 02:09.540
If you wanna write up something for your wolf to howl,

02:09.540 --> 02:12.860
just tag at Pretending Pod on the internet

02:12.860 --> 02:16.620
or write up a five-star review and make sure I seize it.

02:16.620 --> 02:18.900
Heck, if you write up a five-star review

02:18.900 --> 02:21.660
and you title that bad boy howling with wolf

02:21.660 --> 02:23.420
or something to that effect,

02:23.420 --> 02:27.260
I might even just read your review right here on air.

02:27.260 --> 02:29.580
And speaking of airwaves,

02:29.580 --> 02:33.940
we have a privileged, confidential RSS feed

02:33.940 --> 02:35.500
that you can get access to

02:35.500 --> 02:38.040
by supporting this show financially

02:38.040 --> 02:41.480
at patreon.com slash Pretending Pod.

02:41.480 --> 02:44.800
It's basically like having a tin can on a string

02:44.800 --> 02:47.260
coming into the window of your bedroom,

02:47.260 --> 02:50.780
and that string is strung all the way over to me

02:50.780 --> 02:53.400
here in my current studio,

02:53.400 --> 02:56.500
and it's not attached to a tin can on my end.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.340
Ha ha ha, no way.

02:58.340 --> 03:00.300
It's attached to my soul,

03:00.300 --> 03:03.060
and my greedy soul needs feeding,

03:03.060 --> 03:07.120
so heed my reprieve and hop on that secret feed,

03:07.120 --> 03:09.500
and you will receive, I kid you not,

03:09.500 --> 03:13.660
47 bonus episodes for just five bucks.

03:13.660 --> 03:18.020
That's like less than a dime and a penny per bonus episode,

03:18.020 --> 03:19.680
and the most recent ones

03:19.680 --> 03:23.060
are a side-splittingly goofy two-parter

03:23.060 --> 03:27.100
of the boys playing a mad gab-style party RPG

03:27.100 --> 03:29.140
called The People and Patrick,

03:29.140 --> 03:31.900
wherein they played little alien guys

03:31.900 --> 03:36.740
inside a human Jaeger just trying to fit into society.

03:36.740 --> 03:38.740
And not only do you get access

03:38.740 --> 03:42.500
to that thick bonus feed of 47 episodes

03:42.500 --> 03:43.860
you ain't heard yet,

03:43.860 --> 03:46.500
you also get the satisfaction of knowing

03:46.500 --> 03:49.620
that you support the dudes who make this show happen,

03:49.620 --> 03:53.060
like me, Wolf the Dog, and my producer,

03:53.060 --> 03:58.060
and some guys named Tim, John, Luis, and Zarch,

03:58.460 --> 03:59.860
and that's pretty neat.

03:59.860 --> 04:02.060
Oh, you don't have to type out

04:02.060 --> 04:05.380
HTTPS semicolon slash slash

04:05.380 --> 04:09.940
www.patreon.com slash pretending pod.

04:09.940 --> 04:13.740
That's fine, because the links are in the show notes.

04:13.740 --> 04:16.900
I gave up measuring time in SI.

04:16.900 --> 04:19.140
That's a non-sec-quitter,

04:19.140 --> 04:22.780
but that don't mean it ain't time for the news.

04:22.780 --> 04:26.660
Last time, the can crew had a difficult conversation

04:26.660 --> 04:29.860
with Kaylee Silver, difficult due to the presence

04:29.860 --> 04:32.700
of the bagged waxy substance they carried,

04:32.700 --> 04:36.820
but Kaylee did tell them her best friend, Kaylee Gold,

04:36.820 --> 04:39.060
had gotten partially inside her

04:39.060 --> 04:42.180
after Silver took a swig of a new beer

04:42.180 --> 04:45.860
she had brewed with yeasts from the Godel Company,

04:45.860 --> 04:50.340
and that wasn't even the wildest part of last episode.

04:50.340 --> 04:53.300
Julius kicked off a jailbreak attempt

04:53.300 --> 04:55.780
by breaking his dad's shackles

04:55.780 --> 05:00.540
with Dr. Brock Hargrave's unnaturally sharp shovel,

05:00.540 --> 05:03.540
and after Burl took down some guards,

05:03.540 --> 05:06.260
Julius followed in hot pursuit,

05:06.260 --> 05:10.060
taking us now to the moment between Cal Colorado,

05:10.060 --> 05:12.380
Stevie, and Beck Wilder,

05:12.380 --> 05:15.780
where they decide if they want to follow the summers

05:15.780 --> 05:18.340
or bail with their friends in the air.

05:18.340 --> 05:21.420
It's Alter Girl with My Life Is Great

05:21.420 --> 05:23.980
and It Is All My Fault.

05:23.980 --> 05:26.980
My life is all my fault

05:26.980 --> 05:31.980
Cause my life is great

05:31.980 --> 05:33.980
And it's all mine

05:41.980 --> 05:45.980
Cause my life is great

05:45.980 --> 05:48.980
And it's all my fault

05:53.980 --> 05:59.980
Episode 36, Let's Go

05:59.980 --> 06:04.980
Okay Beck, here we are, standing at the precipice.

06:04.980 --> 06:06.980
We either follow the green line back,

06:06.980 --> 06:08.980
or we follow the bodies.

06:08.980 --> 06:11.980
I mean, I think we should follow the bodies.

06:11.980 --> 06:15.980
I don't want to be caught

06:15.980 --> 06:17.980
without the guys who know what they're doing.

06:17.980 --> 06:19.980
Like, this is weird fucking shit,

06:19.980 --> 06:21.980
and I think that we should follow the bodies.

06:21.980 --> 06:22.980
This is weird fucking shit,

06:22.980 --> 06:24.980
and I think that we should follow the guys

06:24.980 --> 06:26.980
who know how to handle weird fucking shit.

06:26.980 --> 06:27.980
Cal thinks about that,

06:27.980 --> 06:29.980
and he doesn't even bring up the news.

06:29.980 --> 06:33.980
He realizes, like, you're right, this is real shit.

06:33.980 --> 06:36.980
He doesn't have to play act about it.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.980
We need to get the fuck out of here.

06:38.980 --> 06:41.980
Do keep rolling though, but yes, yeah, you're right.

06:41.980 --> 06:42.980
I'm kidding at all.

06:42.980 --> 06:43.980
We should get moving.

06:43.980 --> 06:44.980
We do. We hustle.

06:44.980 --> 06:45.980
Let's go.

06:45.980 --> 06:46.980
Let's go, yeah.

06:46.980 --> 06:48.980
Oh yeah, did you want any input, Stevie?

06:48.980 --> 06:49.980
Nope, absolutely not.

06:49.980 --> 06:50.980
I'm down for whatever.

06:50.980 --> 06:51.980
We got this.

06:51.980 --> 06:52.980
We're not going to take his clothes.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.980
That would be making the news.

06:54.980 --> 06:55.980
We're not going to do that.

06:55.980 --> 06:56.980
We're just running.

06:56.980 --> 06:57.980
Yeah, yeah, let's go.

06:57.980 --> 06:59.980
And running we shall.

07:03.980 --> 07:05.980
Yeah, so you're already at the end of this hallway,

07:05.980 --> 07:07.980
so you bust through the next door.

07:07.980 --> 07:09.980
Bust through.

07:09.980 --> 07:11.980
You probably gently open this next door.

07:11.980 --> 07:13.980
Stevie goes and-

07:13.980 --> 07:14.980
Use the shovel on that door!

07:14.980 --> 07:16.980
Creeps around.

07:17.980 --> 07:18.980
They turn.

07:18.980 --> 07:19.980
They're like, what?

07:19.980 --> 07:22.980
And the shovel goes through the door.

07:22.980 --> 07:26.980
Stevie creeps out through the door and opens it gently

07:26.980 --> 07:30.980
and sticks her head around the corner and turns back to you,

07:30.980 --> 07:35.980
holding one fist in the air and then turning it into two fingers

07:35.980 --> 07:37.980
and jutting them forward like, let's go.

07:37.980 --> 07:38.980
I look at Gal.

07:38.980 --> 07:41.980
Dude, it's like Navy Seal shit.

07:41.980 --> 07:42.980
Navy Seal shit.

07:42.980 --> 07:43.980
Yeah, that was cool.

07:43.980 --> 07:48.980
They keep moving and coming up there is an intersection of the hallway.

07:48.980 --> 07:51.980
So you are in a corridor that continues on straight

07:51.980 --> 07:53.980
and then tees off at the end,

07:53.980 --> 07:58.980
but then there's a hallway that runs through this hallway left and right.

07:58.980 --> 08:04.980
And right as you open the door, you all see Julius and Burl Summers.

08:04.980 --> 08:07.980
And Burl seemed to be counting.

08:07.980 --> 08:11.980
And then you just see Burl grab Julius' shirt collar

08:11.980 --> 08:15.980
and then they run together around the corner to the left,

08:15.980 --> 08:16.980
15 yards away from you.

08:16.980 --> 08:18.980
And sirens are going wild.

08:18.980 --> 08:21.980
What did you mean by seems to be counting?

08:21.980 --> 08:23.980
Is he using his fingers or is he looking at something?

08:23.980 --> 08:28.980
Yeah, using his fingers and counting out loud.

08:28.980 --> 08:29.980
Oh, gotcha.

08:29.980 --> 08:31.980
Do you think he's got the numbers in him?

08:31.980 --> 08:33.980
Oh, Beck, roll grip.

08:36.980 --> 08:37.980
Fuck.

08:37.980 --> 08:38.980
52.

08:38.980 --> 08:40.980
I've rolled a bunch of 50, so I'm retiring these days.

08:40.980 --> 08:43.980
Because I said that or because he saw that?

08:43.980 --> 08:44.980
Because he saw that.

08:44.980 --> 08:45.980
Okay.

08:45.980 --> 08:48.980
Beck, you lose one grip and you are almost positive.

08:48.980 --> 08:51.980
Then I saw an eight and a three and a C.

08:51.980 --> 08:54.980
He held up four fingers on one hand, four fingers on another hand.

08:54.980 --> 08:56.980
Then he held up three fingers on one hand,

08:56.980 --> 08:59.980
and then he held five fingers on one hand and one finger on the other hand.

08:59.980 --> 09:02.980
And you also think maybe he mouthed.

09:02.980 --> 09:04.980
And he said, eight, three, six.

09:06.980 --> 09:07.980
Okay, okay.

09:07.980 --> 09:09.980
I like the first one.

09:09.980 --> 09:11.980
That's not super weird.

09:11.980 --> 09:13.980
I mean, it's the fucking weirdest.

09:13.980 --> 09:15.980
But no, it is weird.

09:15.980 --> 09:16.980
Thank you.

09:16.980 --> 09:17.980
I'm not.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.980
All the eight, three, six stuff is weird.

09:24.980 --> 09:26.980
It's not weird that he was saying it necessarily

09:26.980 --> 09:29.980
because he's the guy who takes care of weird stuff.

09:29.980 --> 09:31.980
And so Julius told him about it.

09:31.980 --> 09:34.980
And so he's, you know, making sure he got it right.

09:34.980 --> 09:35.980
Did I hear you right, son?

09:35.980 --> 09:36.980
Eight, three, six.

09:36.980 --> 09:37.980
Eight, three, six?

09:37.980 --> 09:38.980
Eight, three, six.

09:38.980 --> 09:42.980
Yeah, so, you know, if you want to learn more about it,

09:42.980 --> 09:44.980
we could just follow that guy.

09:44.980 --> 09:46.980
I think we should go and ask him.

09:48.980 --> 09:49.980
Perfect.

09:49.980 --> 09:51.980
Carrot is donkey.

09:56.980 --> 09:59.980
The three of you run forward and turn the corner left.

09:59.980 --> 10:03.980
And as you turn the corner left, you all kind of check your right,

10:03.980 --> 10:07.980
like you're looking both ways before you cross the street almost.

10:07.980 --> 10:11.980
You see no one down either end of the corridor.

10:12.980 --> 10:15.980
And ahead of you, you see Burl and Julius.

10:15.980 --> 10:17.980
And I think we can get Luke in the room.

10:34.980 --> 10:35.980
Which one worked?

10:35.980 --> 10:36.980
I don't know.

10:37.980 --> 10:38.980
Woo!

10:40.980 --> 10:41.980
So...

10:42.980 --> 10:46.980
Julius, Burl counts, lands on the number, grabs you,

10:46.980 --> 10:51.980
turns the corner left, and you all begin making your way down this hallway.

10:52.980 --> 10:55.980
Suddenly, Julius hollers.

10:55.980 --> 10:57.980
What does it mean?

10:57.980 --> 11:03.980
And as Julius hollers that, the blinds on the windows of the rooms

11:03.980 --> 11:06.980
on either side of this corridor flick open.

11:06.980 --> 11:10.980
And he also sees down the end of the hallway, back the way you came,

11:10.980 --> 11:16.980
turning the corner that you just turned, Cal Colorado, Beck Wilder, and Stevie.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.980
Julius, dude! Wait up!

11:18.980 --> 11:23.980
Julius gets super calm all of a sudden and just looks at his dad.

11:23.980 --> 11:24.980
There's your shovel.

11:24.980 --> 11:28.980
The camera does a crazy anime zoom-in on the shovel

11:28.980 --> 11:32.980
tucked underneath Stevie's arm on top of one of the bags.

11:33.980 --> 11:34.980
Come on, guys!

11:36.980 --> 11:38.980
Beck wants to come running up and saying,

11:38.980 --> 11:40.980
What does it mean? Were you asking him about the numbers?

11:40.980 --> 11:42.980
Because I saw him counting numbers!

11:42.980 --> 11:43.980
Was it the 836?

11:43.980 --> 11:45.980
Julius just shrugs, yep.

11:45.980 --> 11:47.980
Fucking what does it mean, he says to Burl.

11:47.980 --> 11:51.980
You weren't supposed to start yelling. They weren't supposed to see us.

11:51.980 --> 11:57.980
And Burl turns and kicks open the door behind him in this hallway.

11:57.980 --> 12:01.980
Julius watches him do it, and what Julius sees is his dad

12:01.980 --> 12:06.980
holding a Nerf gun, just kind of jokingly kicking open the door.

12:06.980 --> 12:08.980
And he looks down and he's got a Nerf gun too.

12:10.980 --> 12:15.980
And he follows his dad, waving the other guys to follow him.

12:15.980 --> 12:21.980
Cal, Beck, and Stevie see officers on either side,

12:21.980 --> 12:27.980
one in each room with the blinds open, one on the left, one on the right.

12:27.980 --> 12:31.980
And they're making their way toward the door into this corridor.

12:31.980 --> 12:33.980
We're going in dexterity order.

12:33.980 --> 12:34.980
Oh, fuck.

12:34.980 --> 12:35.980
Who's up?

12:35.980 --> 12:36.980
I've got a 70.

12:36.980 --> 12:37.980
I've got a 50.

12:37.980 --> 12:38.980
45.

12:38.980 --> 12:42.980
So we started with Julius, who went through the door following his dad.

12:42.980 --> 12:43.980
Correct.

12:43.980 --> 12:44.980
Burl Summers.

12:44.980 --> 12:49.980
And then we have Stevie, who immediately dips, does the same,

12:49.980 --> 12:53.980
and follows, runs with the bag out the door behind Julius.

12:53.980 --> 12:55.980
I would like to do that too.

12:55.980 --> 12:57.980
As well would I.

12:57.980 --> 13:02.980
Okay, so we've got two officers coming in hot pursuit of you all

13:02.980 --> 13:05.980
as you run through this door.

13:05.980 --> 13:07.980
We've got a long hallway.

13:07.980 --> 13:10.980
This next one, we've got a long hallway,

13:10.980 --> 13:17.980
and it has just windows on the left side into the outdoor area

13:17.980 --> 13:21.980
where you see inmates in the hot July sun,

13:21.980 --> 13:25.980
playing basketball, lifting weights, hanging out, playing hacky sack.

13:25.980 --> 13:30.980
There seems to be a group at a table with some, like,

13:30.980 --> 13:34.980
sticks and leaves splayed out in different areas on the table,

13:34.980 --> 13:37.980
and you all are sprinting down this hallway.

13:37.980 --> 13:40.980
I need everyone to roll athletics.

13:45.980 --> 13:46.980
Pass.

13:47.980 --> 13:48.980
Fail.

13:48.980 --> 13:49.980
Critical fail.

13:49.980 --> 13:50.980
88.

13:51.980 --> 13:53.980
Cal trips on his old ass.

13:56.980 --> 13:57.980
Oh, fuck Cal.

13:57.980 --> 13:59.980
Ouchie, ouchie.

13:59.980 --> 14:00.980
My ankle.

14:03.980 --> 14:04.980
Roll a D4.

14:05.980 --> 14:06.980
Ooh, ooh.

14:06.980 --> 14:07.980
Ouchie, ouchie.

14:07.980 --> 14:08.980
Two ouchies.

14:10.980 --> 14:11.980
Carry me back.

14:13.980 --> 14:18.980
I do like a sports carry, you know, getting his arm around my shoulders,

14:18.980 --> 14:21.980
and now we're three-legged racing down the hall.

14:22.980 --> 14:23.980
Okay.

14:23.980 --> 14:25.980
Burl, and did you succeed?

14:25.980 --> 14:26.980
I did.

14:26.980 --> 14:30.980
Burl, Stevie, and Julius all make it to the next door.

14:30.980 --> 14:33.980
Burl blasts through this next door.

14:33.980 --> 14:34.980
Julius?

14:34.980 --> 14:35.980
Following his dad.

14:35.980 --> 14:36.980
Following his dad.

14:36.980 --> 14:40.980
And Stevie stops and looks back.

14:44.980 --> 14:45.980
It's okay, Stevie.

14:45.980 --> 14:47.980
You can go on ahead if you have to.

14:47.980 --> 14:52.980
And Stevie runs toward you, back down this long hallway,

14:52.980 --> 14:57.980
and then past you, and they grab the shovel out from under their arm

14:57.980 --> 15:03.980
and levy it forward as the door opens, and two officers come through it.

15:03.980 --> 15:04.980
Stevie, no!

15:05.980 --> 15:09.980
They miss, and the shovel goes right into the door

15:09.980 --> 15:14.980
and just sinks itself right into the door, and as they pull back,

15:14.980 --> 15:19.980
they pull a massive chunk of the door out with them,

15:19.980 --> 15:23.980
and these two officers are just staring in disbelief,

15:23.980 --> 15:29.980
one of them completely frozen, unable to handle what they just saw.

15:29.980 --> 15:33.980
The shovel went through a door like it was Play-Doh.

15:33.980 --> 15:37.980
The other one loosens their neck and lunges forward,

15:37.980 --> 15:42.980
grabs at the shovel, Stevie pulls it back, and they are locked.

15:42.980 --> 15:47.980
They both have two hands on the shovel, and they're just tugging back and forth.

15:47.980 --> 15:48.980
What do you do, Joe?

15:48.980 --> 15:51.980
Beck wants to pull something out of his pockets

15:51.980 --> 15:55.980
to throw at the feet of the tussle to try and...

15:55.980 --> 15:57.980
He wants it to be in favor of Stevie,

15:57.980 --> 15:59.980
but it's really just they're going to be thrown off balance,

15:59.980 --> 16:01.980
and somebody's going to win that struggle.

16:01.980 --> 16:03.980
Interesting. Okay.

16:03.980 --> 16:05.980
So throwing off their footing?

16:05.980 --> 16:06.980
Yeah.

16:06.980 --> 16:07.980
Okay.

16:08.980 --> 16:13.980
All right, go ahead and roll to see what you end up finding.

16:13.980 --> 16:15.980
I think you can roll a search here,

16:15.980 --> 16:21.980
or you can roll your news skill for going through your camera bag, I guess.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.980
I pass my videographer skill.

16:23.980 --> 16:24.980
Okay, that'll do.

16:24.980 --> 16:26.980
A bunch of mic clips.

16:26.980 --> 16:27.980
Okay, yeah.

16:27.980 --> 16:30.980
Yeah, just little odd-shaped mic clips.

16:30.980 --> 16:33.980
I throw them back there like caltrops.

16:34.980 --> 16:38.980
Good name for a TikTok segment.

16:40.980 --> 16:45.980
Fail for Stevie, crit fail for the officer.

16:45.980 --> 16:47.980
So kind of maybe worked?

16:47.980 --> 16:49.980
Like perfectly worked.

16:49.980 --> 16:56.980
The officer who is gripping with two hands on this shovel

16:56.980 --> 16:59.980
loses their footing as one of these mic clips

16:59.980 --> 17:01.980
just slips right underneath their heel

17:01.980 --> 17:03.980
that they were going to put all their pressure on,

17:03.980 --> 17:06.980
and it slips out from underneath them.

17:06.980 --> 17:08.980
They start falling backwards.

17:08.980 --> 17:10.980
Stevie can't hold on.

17:10.980 --> 17:14.980
Neither can the officer as they land right on their tailbone,

17:14.980 --> 17:19.980
and the shovel falls to the ground next to them.

17:19.980 --> 17:24.980
The officer that is kind of dazed is slowly kind of coming out of it,

17:24.980 --> 17:26.980
but it's Cal Colorado's turn.

17:26.980 --> 17:30.980
Cal wants to try to hobble over there as quickly as he can.

17:30.980 --> 17:33.980
Can I try a persuade roll on combat?

17:33.980 --> 17:34.980
Yeah, absolutely.

17:34.980 --> 17:36.980
He just shouts,

17:36.980 --> 17:40.980
Wait, wait, this is a huge misunderstanding.

17:40.980 --> 17:43.980
This was just a reenactment for the news.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.980
Awesome.

17:45.980 --> 17:48.980
Roll persuade.

17:48.980 --> 17:55.980
70 on a 80.

17:55.980 --> 17:58.980
Fuck yeah.

17:58.980 --> 18:01.980
The officer succeeds, but at a lower rate,

18:01.980 --> 18:05.980
and they're already blown away by the shovel,

18:05.980 --> 18:07.980
and so they connect the dots.

18:07.980 --> 18:09.980
This is a prop door.

18:09.980 --> 18:11.980
It's a special effect.

18:11.980 --> 18:15.980
It's all movie magic, as they say.

18:15.980 --> 18:19.980
And he's like, Oh, oh.

18:19.980 --> 18:22.980
We're at the city news, so we have pretty a big budget.

18:22.980 --> 18:24.980
No, of course, of course.

18:24.980 --> 18:26.980
That makes all the sense in the world.

18:26.980 --> 18:30.980
Yeah, so sorry about the mic clip thing.

18:30.980 --> 18:32.980
You could call the network.

18:32.980 --> 18:34.980
Oh, it looks like there's a hole in my pocket.

18:34.980 --> 18:35.980
Dang it.

18:35.980 --> 18:37.980
They must have all spilled out of there.

18:37.980 --> 18:39.980
Probably caught on one of those prison doors, so.

18:39.980 --> 18:41.980
Get on up here, Batralamude.

18:41.980 --> 18:42.980
Come on.

18:42.980 --> 18:44.980
And he helps the other guy up.

18:44.980 --> 18:45.980
Batralamude?

18:45.980 --> 18:47.980
That's an amazing name.

18:47.980 --> 18:49.980
Oh, you know, he doesn't like to talk about it too much.

18:49.980 --> 18:53.980
No, I don't.

18:53.980 --> 18:55.980
Are we going to be in the news?

18:55.980 --> 18:57.980
Batralamude, I wasn't really set up for that shot,

18:57.980 --> 18:59.980
but yeah, if you want to go back through that door

18:59.980 --> 19:00.980
and wait for your cue.

19:00.980 --> 19:01.980
Okay.

19:01.980 --> 19:03.980
We'll shout at you when you need to come through.

19:03.980 --> 19:04.980
Okay, sounds good.

19:04.980 --> 19:06.980
Do we need to reset this door?

19:06.980 --> 19:07.980
Reset the door.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.980
And if you could also radio ahead to,

19:09.980 --> 19:11.980
I think some of your other colleagues

19:11.980 --> 19:13.980
might have taken this a little too seriously.

19:13.980 --> 19:16.980
Oh, are these alarms like part of your...

19:16.980 --> 19:17.980
It's all fake.

19:17.980 --> 19:19.980
Well, these are the real alarms.

19:19.980 --> 19:22.980
All right, well, yes, but it's a fake scenario, you see.

19:22.980 --> 19:23.980
Yeah, okay.

19:23.980 --> 19:24.980
For the noose.

19:24.980 --> 19:26.980
Hmm, wow.

19:26.980 --> 19:28.980
You could just get the word out to not resist.

19:28.980 --> 19:31.980
Beck just kind of says into the air,

19:31.980 --> 19:33.980
all right, we're going to reset to one.

19:33.980 --> 19:35.980
Resetting everybody, resetting everybody.

19:35.980 --> 19:37.980
Batralamude, you've been great.

19:37.980 --> 19:38.980
Thank you.

19:38.980 --> 19:39.980
What was your name, sir?

19:39.980 --> 19:40.980
Nah, Jerram.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.980
Jerram.

19:42.980 --> 19:44.980
Jerram and Batralamude.

19:44.980 --> 19:50.980
You two are just for Zach, huh?

19:50.980 --> 19:53.980
Didn't know we were going to have so much talking to do.

19:53.980 --> 19:58.980
Zach's like, names, names.

19:58.980 --> 20:04.980
Jared, big cat, Batralamude.

20:04.980 --> 20:06.980
What are they really?

20:06.980 --> 20:07.980
What?

20:07.980 --> 20:08.980
What are, who are those?

20:08.980 --> 20:09.980
What do you mean?

20:09.980 --> 20:10.980
In the Bible.

20:10.980 --> 20:11.980
Oh.

20:11.980 --> 20:13.980
No, I don't think either one of those are...

20:13.980 --> 20:14.980
Oh, I assumed.

20:14.980 --> 20:15.980
Nope.

20:15.980 --> 20:16.980
Okay.

20:16.980 --> 20:17.980
Nope.

20:17.980 --> 20:19.980
Cool, waste of time.

20:20.980 --> 20:24.980
That was the question he was, so.

20:24.980 --> 20:27.980
I mean, should I have answered?

20:27.980 --> 20:29.980
Yes, and.

20:29.980 --> 20:31.980
Nah, I don't do that shit.

20:31.980 --> 20:34.980
If the plan is working, they're going back through the door.

20:34.980 --> 20:35.980
And we're going.

20:35.980 --> 20:36.980
Running away.

20:36.980 --> 20:37.980
Yeah, we're leaving.

20:37.980 --> 20:43.980
As you run away, Jerram looks through the hole in the door and he's like,

20:43.980 --> 20:47.980
I thought you said you were going to reset the door to the...

20:47.980 --> 20:49.980
Props department will be here in a minute.

20:49.980 --> 20:51.980
We've got to go to makeup.

20:51.980 --> 20:57.980
And the three of you run through the next door.

20:57.980 --> 21:01.980
And on the other side, you see that.

21:01.980 --> 21:06.980
It's so great that this worked.

21:06.980 --> 21:12.980
I thought we were going to die.

21:12.980 --> 21:13.980
I've had dreams like this.

21:13.980 --> 21:17.980
I didn't realize I could just tell them it was for the news.

21:17.980 --> 21:19.980
It's for the news.

21:19.980 --> 21:20.980
Hey, buddy.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.980
Calm down.

21:23.980 --> 21:33.980
When the door opens, Julius is pleading with Burl Summers as they stand at the precipice of another corner.

21:33.980 --> 21:36.980
And once again, Burl is counting.

21:36.980 --> 21:38.980
He looks at Beck.

21:38.980 --> 21:39.980
He's doing it again.

21:39.980 --> 21:43.980
735, 736, 737.

21:43.980 --> 21:45.980
He hasn't said the numbers yet, but it's okay.

21:45.980 --> 21:47.980
He's going to say the numbers.

21:47.980 --> 21:48.980
We've got to get to him.

21:48.980 --> 21:49.980
We've got to get to him.

21:49.980 --> 21:50.980
There's still like 100.

21:50.980 --> 21:53.980
Yeah, there's a lot of numbers before he gets to the one that I'm scared of.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.980
We can knock him over or something.

21:55.980 --> 21:56.980
I don't know.

21:56.980 --> 21:59.980
I think he's counting to make sure that we go at the right time.

21:59.980 --> 22:00.980
He's got the plan.

22:00.980 --> 22:01.980
Oh.

22:01.980 --> 22:02.980
Oh.

22:02.980 --> 22:07.980
And that took me a while to say, so he's probably at a much higher number.

22:07.980 --> 22:08.980
812.

22:08.980 --> 22:09.980
813.

22:09.980 --> 22:11.980
So we're just following the numbers?

22:11.980 --> 22:12.980
Did we let him do it?

22:12.980 --> 22:15.980
I mean, which way are we going?

22:15.980 --> 22:16.980
Point.

22:16.980 --> 22:23.980
He points, but then he gives you the don't go hand motion and then holds up a finger.

22:23.980 --> 22:29.980
You're about to fucking say 836, and that's going to mean something to you, and I want it to mean something to me.

22:29.980 --> 22:32.980
834, 835, 836.

22:32.980 --> 22:33.980
Let's go.

22:33.980 --> 22:34.980
Fucking told you.

22:34.980 --> 22:35.980
And then he dips around the corner.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.980
Julius starts running.

22:37.980 --> 22:41.980
Beck doesn't immediately go and turns to Stevie and Cal.

22:41.980 --> 22:43.980
It's the fucking numbers, but maybe they're a good thing.

22:43.980 --> 22:44.980
We gotta go.

22:44.980 --> 22:45.980
We gotta go.

22:45.980 --> 22:46.980
Let's go.

22:46.980 --> 22:47.980
Let's go.

22:47.980 --> 22:48.980
Let's go.

22:48.980 --> 22:59.980
And at the exact moment that you all turn this corner and start running out, you see a door in the lobby close, and you are now in the lobby, the foyer of this jail.

22:59.980 --> 23:09.980
But the way that this escape has been timed out, there's only one person in the area, and it's Officer-

23:09.980 --> 23:10.980
Peeler!

23:10.980 --> 23:11.980
Peeler!

23:11.980 --> 23:12.980
Peeler, open the door!

23:12.980 --> 23:13.980
We got it for the shot.

23:13.980 --> 23:16.980
Peeler, have you heard about the reenactment for the news?

23:16.980 --> 23:20.980
Well, yeah, somebody sent through on the radio about the-

23:20.980 --> 23:23.980
We need you to buzz the door open so we don't lose our shot.

23:23.980 --> 23:24.980
Hurry!

23:24.980 --> 23:25.980
Golden hour, Peeler!

23:25.980 --> 23:26.980
Golden hour!

23:26.980 --> 23:29.980
And then Julius starts running towards the door, hoping it is gonna open.

23:29.980 --> 23:30.980
Awesome.

23:30.980 --> 23:34.980
Roll, persuade, probably Cal.

23:34.980 --> 23:36.980
75 on an 80.

23:36.980 --> 23:38.980
Yes!

23:38.980 --> 23:40.980
He succeeds with a 62.

23:40.980 --> 23:41.980
Ooh!

23:41.980 --> 23:44.980
That would've been scary.

23:44.980 --> 23:53.980
As Julius makes it to the door, the red light goes green, and Julius's massive thighs slam into the metal bar that open.

23:53.980 --> 23:54.980
Ka-junk!

23:54.980 --> 23:58.980
Peeler, out of the lobby and into the world.

23:58.980 --> 23:59.980
Woohoo!

23:59.980 --> 24:00.980
That was fun!

24:00.980 --> 24:03.980
Oh my god, we're gonna get to keep doing this!

24:03.980 --> 24:05.980
And he's like looking at his dad, stoked.

24:05.980 --> 24:09.980
Beck grabs Burl by the collar and pulls him in.

24:09.980 --> 24:20.980
On the front steps of this beautiful city jail with this oppressive architecture, big concrete columns, big concrete stairs.

24:20.980 --> 24:29.980
And at the top, where a rocky-like figure might feel victory, Beck feels what?

24:29.980 --> 24:34.980
From the outside it would look like anger, but inside it's pleading help.

24:34.980 --> 24:39.980
What do they fucking mean?

24:39.980 --> 24:45.980
Burl smiles a stringy smile.

24:45.980 --> 24:48.980
What is a stringy smile?

24:48.980 --> 24:51.980
Oh, it's like, yeah.

24:51.980 --> 24:52.980
Saliva-y.

24:52.980 --> 24:57.980
His teeth become floss in it.

24:57.980 --> 24:59.980
Flossy.

24:59.980 --> 25:02.980
Ew, flossy teeth.

25:02.980 --> 25:05.980
Somebody just leaves fucking strands trailing.

25:05.980 --> 25:08.980
Oh, I call it my baleens.

25:08.980 --> 25:10.980
That one over my head.

25:10.980 --> 25:13.980
It's the plates that whales use to trap plankton.

25:13.980 --> 25:14.980
Oh, nice.

25:14.980 --> 25:15.980
Nerd.

25:15.980 --> 25:18.980
It's whale teeth.

25:18.980 --> 25:22.980
Uh, more people than just nerds watch fucking planet Earth, Luke.

25:22.980 --> 25:26.980
Oh, never mind.

25:26.980 --> 25:28.980
What, you think just stoners and nerds are watching?

25:28.980 --> 25:29.980
There it is.

25:29.980 --> 25:32.980
Yeah, no, you're right.

25:32.980 --> 25:35.980
Julius is looking at his dad like he wants to know too.

25:35.980 --> 25:37.980
I don't know. I'm sorry.

25:37.980 --> 25:39.980
Then why say it?

25:39.980 --> 25:41.980
It works.

25:41.980 --> 25:43.980
It fucking works.

25:43.980 --> 25:44.980
We need to go.

25:44.980 --> 25:47.980
And he dips down the stairs.

25:47.980 --> 25:48.980
Where's your ride?

25:48.980 --> 25:50.980
Did we just park in front?

25:50.980 --> 25:51.980
Yeah.

25:51.980 --> 25:52.980
I think so.

25:52.980 --> 25:53.980
I did, yeah.

25:53.980 --> 25:55.980
I'll drive if you want.

25:55.980 --> 25:58.980
And he kind of just does a little jog down the steps.

25:58.980 --> 26:01.980
Like that all didn't just happen.

26:01.980 --> 26:05.980
Beep, beep.

26:05.980 --> 26:07.980
Can we let them use...

26:07.980 --> 26:10.980
What if we just called you guys an Uber or something?

26:10.980 --> 26:11.980
That's a betting.

26:11.980 --> 26:13.980
That's still a betting.

26:13.980 --> 26:15.980
We already abetted.

26:15.980 --> 26:17.980
We did the ruse.

26:17.980 --> 26:18.980
We abetted.

26:18.980 --> 26:19.980
We did do a ruse.

26:19.980 --> 26:20.980
We abetted.

26:20.980 --> 26:24.980
You're saying in the can van as you're driving away from the crime.

26:24.980 --> 26:26.980
The full blown crime.

26:26.980 --> 26:27.980
We are a betting.

26:27.980 --> 26:28.980
We are a betting.

26:28.980 --> 26:30.980
Julius is driving away and just being like,

26:30.980 --> 26:32.980
yeah, you guys are in now.

26:32.980 --> 26:36.980
I told you.

26:36.980 --> 26:39.980
Holy shit.

26:39.980 --> 26:41.980
Beck, we're going to have to...

26:41.980 --> 26:42.980
We're going to have to...

26:42.980 --> 26:43.980
Are you guys hungry?

26:43.980 --> 26:44.980
Destroy that footage.

26:44.980 --> 26:46.980
I mean, or...

26:46.980 --> 26:47.980
Oh, you're right.

26:47.980 --> 26:49.980
The honorable thing to do is to send it to the police ourselves.

26:49.980 --> 26:52.980
Yeah, but like later.

26:52.980 --> 26:55.980
Does Burl have anything to say about that?

26:55.980 --> 26:59.980
Burl is just giving you big eyes with a knowing look.

26:59.980 --> 27:01.980
He's giving him a little fist bump.

27:01.980 --> 27:02.980
Thanks for getting me out.

27:02.980 --> 27:05.980
Yeah, I mean, I figured you'd maybe use the shovel,

27:05.980 --> 27:07.980
but that was interesting too.

27:07.980 --> 27:08.980
Abet, here we are.

27:08.980 --> 27:10.980
Well, you use the shovel.

27:10.980 --> 27:11.980
True.

27:11.980 --> 27:12.980
Anything for you.

27:12.980 --> 27:13.980
Are you guys hungry?

27:13.980 --> 27:14.980
You're probably hungry.

27:14.980 --> 27:15.980
What do you want?

27:15.980 --> 27:18.980
Oh, you know what I could really go for is tacos.

27:18.980 --> 27:22.980
And Julius is just going to aimlessly drive until he sees tacos.

27:22.980 --> 27:25.980
Julius, dude, are you okay, dude?

27:25.980 --> 27:26.980
Yeah.

27:26.980 --> 27:27.980
My dad's here.

27:27.980 --> 27:31.980
You seem really unaffected by the fact that we just broke your dad out of jail

27:31.980 --> 27:34.980
and like almost got in jail ourselves.

27:34.980 --> 27:37.980
Julius is kind of like, what are you talking about?

27:38.980 --> 27:40.980
Whatever, Beck.

27:40.980 --> 27:41.980
We got my dad's ear.

27:41.980 --> 27:43.980
Going to get tacos.

27:43.980 --> 27:45.980
I give a worried glance to Cal.

27:45.980 --> 27:48.980
Hey, Mr. Summers.

27:48.980 --> 27:49.980
Yeah.

27:49.980 --> 27:53.980
Can we have a talk about your parenting style?

27:53.980 --> 27:56.980
What can you learn?

27:56.980 --> 28:01.980
I was very confident.

28:01.980 --> 28:04.980
What's going on here between you and your boy?

28:04.980 --> 28:10.980
I've raised Julius to take care of the actual world,

28:10.980 --> 28:13.980
the underlying reality that exists,

28:13.980 --> 28:18.980
that we hide away from those who would otherwise be affected.

28:18.980 --> 28:19.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:19.980 --> 28:20.980
We know all about that.

28:20.980 --> 28:22.980
I live in the shadows.

28:22.980 --> 28:25.980
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

28:25.980 --> 28:28.980
Dad, I forgot to tell you, you're going to be stoked.

28:28.980 --> 28:29.980
Typh?

28:29.980 --> 28:31.980
No.

28:31.980 --> 28:32.980
Really?

28:32.980 --> 28:33.980
Yeah.

28:33.980 --> 28:34.980
What happened?

28:34.980 --> 28:35.980
I killed him.

28:35.980 --> 28:36.980
Wait, you killed him?

28:36.980 --> 28:37.980
I killed him.

28:37.980 --> 28:38.980
That's what he tells us.

28:38.980 --> 28:41.980
I thought we were compartmentalizing that.

28:44.980 --> 28:46.980
This is what I want to talk about.

28:46.980 --> 28:49.980
You have a strange effect on this boy,

28:49.980 --> 28:51.980
and I don't think it's entirely natural.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.980
Speaking of the dark weirdness of the world or whatnot.

28:54.980 --> 28:58.980
Something about hearing Cal and his tone of voice

28:58.980 --> 29:02.980
kind of snaps Julius back a little bit.

29:02.980 --> 29:04.980
As he's driving, he starts to just sweat.

29:04.980 --> 29:05.980
There.

29:05.980 --> 29:06.980
See?

29:06.980 --> 29:07.980
Julius.

29:07.980 --> 29:10.980
Julius, are you in there, boy?

29:10.980 --> 29:13.980
And he's like shaking, and he has to pull the van over.

29:13.980 --> 29:15.980
What are you doing?

29:15.980 --> 29:16.980
His heart is like racing.

29:16.980 --> 29:17.980
He needs a medic.

29:17.980 --> 29:18.980
Can you tell?

29:18.980 --> 29:19.980
We have to keep going.

29:19.980 --> 29:20.980
What the fuck?

29:20.980 --> 29:23.980
We did not go in there to do that.

29:23.980 --> 29:27.980
No, I mean, I didn't know that you were even coming today.

29:27.980 --> 29:29.980
I didn't know that this was happening either.

29:29.980 --> 29:30.980
Oh my fucking God.

29:30.980 --> 29:31.980
We have to destroy that tape.

29:31.980 --> 29:32.980
Why were you filming?

29:32.980 --> 29:33.980
We do have to destroy that tape.

29:33.980 --> 29:36.980
Guys, what if it's the thing that proves we were right all along?

29:36.980 --> 29:38.980
In what way?

29:38.980 --> 29:39.980
I don't know.

29:39.980 --> 29:40.980
The numbers are a thing.

29:40.980 --> 29:45.980
Hold on.

29:45.980 --> 29:49.980
Julius starts driving again, maybe towards tacos,

29:49.980 --> 29:51.980
probably just aimlessly.

29:51.980 --> 29:53.980
I think we got to tell him.

29:53.980 --> 29:57.980
Like, we got to fill him in.

29:57.980 --> 29:58.980
And then they fill him in.

29:59.980 --> 30:04.980
Isn't that fucking crazy?

30:04.980 --> 30:06.980
I mean, are you guys cool with that?

30:06.980 --> 30:09.980
We're filling Burl in on all of our escapades.

30:09.980 --> 30:10.980
Yeah.

30:10.980 --> 30:14.980
Beck is fine with it because he is using that as part of the argument to not destroy the footage.

30:14.980 --> 30:15.980
It's all linked.

30:15.980 --> 30:16.980
See?

30:16.980 --> 30:19.980
At the end of the day, we're going to have this body of evidence.

30:19.980 --> 30:20.980
It's going to be irrefutable.

30:20.980 --> 30:21.980
Bodies.

30:21.980 --> 30:24.980
Yeah, there's been a lot of bodies.

30:24.980 --> 30:26.980
Is it for the greater good?

30:26.980 --> 30:27.980
Is it?

30:27.980 --> 30:30.980
This might be one of those things where the ends justify the means?

30:30.980 --> 30:31.980
Oh, yeah.

30:31.980 --> 30:32.980
Definitely.

30:32.980 --> 30:33.980
Obviously.

30:33.980 --> 30:36.980
I mean, think about what we're doing.

30:36.980 --> 30:37.980
What are we doing?

30:37.980 --> 30:38.980
What are you doing?

30:38.980 --> 30:43.980
We're learning about the world and how it works and we work in the shadows.

30:43.980 --> 30:48.980
And we keep the world safe from that which they cannot know.

30:48.980 --> 30:53.980
You know, I kicked the ass of a creep a lot like you just a few hours ago.

30:53.980 --> 30:55.980
Julius is so offended.

30:56.980 --> 30:58.980
Don't talk to daddy like that.

30:58.980 --> 30:59.980
I knew it.

30:59.980 --> 31:00.980
I knew there was some weird thing.

31:00.980 --> 31:03.980
You went to him so quickly with his whole daddy bed.

31:03.980 --> 31:05.980
I was just looking for somebody.

31:05.980 --> 31:07.980
And now I've got two.

31:07.980 --> 31:09.980
I have to be everybody's fucking dad?

31:11.980 --> 31:12.980
No.

31:12.980 --> 31:13.980
You don't.

31:13.980 --> 31:14.980
He has a dad.

31:14.980 --> 31:15.980
But look at you.

31:15.980 --> 31:16.980
Come on, look at me.

31:16.980 --> 31:17.980
Look at you.

31:17.980 --> 31:18.980
You're three weird strands.

31:18.980 --> 31:19.980
We just broke you out of jail.

31:19.980 --> 31:21.980
You hypnotized your son into breaking you out of jail.

31:21.980 --> 31:22.980
I mean, he-

31:22.980 --> 31:24.980
Who would call that good parenting?

31:24.980 --> 31:25.980
Hmm?

31:25.980 --> 31:27.980
I'd call it good sunning for sure.

31:27.980 --> 31:28.980
Thanks.

31:28.980 --> 31:29.980
Good job, son.

31:29.980 --> 31:32.980
Dad, maybe tell him about the rat guy.

31:34.980 --> 31:35.980
Tell me about the rat guy.

31:35.980 --> 31:37.980
You want to know about Matthew?

31:45.980 --> 31:47.980
Oh my God.

31:47.980 --> 31:49.980
Beck, are you filming?

31:51.980 --> 31:52.980
Keep driving, Julius.

31:52.980 --> 31:53.980
Yes, sir.

31:53.980 --> 31:54.980
Toward tacos.

31:54.980 --> 31:58.980
Julius types in, best tacos near me.

31:58.980 --> 32:03.980
And he spends a little too much time actually reading the reviews of every place.

32:03.980 --> 32:04.980
I want birria tacos.

32:04.980 --> 32:05.980
Oh, okay.

32:05.980 --> 32:09.980
Julius finds one with birria tacos and heads there.

32:09.980 --> 32:13.980
And the place is called Beer E A Taco.

32:13.980 --> 32:15.980
Like beer and one taco?

32:15.980 --> 32:19.980
Beer and a taco in English and Spanish.

32:19.980 --> 32:21.980
Beer E A Taco.

32:22.980 --> 32:26.980
While we're heading to Beer E A Taco, Mr. Summers.

32:26.980 --> 32:27.980
Yeah.

32:27.980 --> 32:29.980
Why don't you tell me about Matthew?

32:29.980 --> 32:32.980
Matthew was kind.

32:32.980 --> 32:34.980
He was good.

32:34.980 --> 32:44.980
He was, well, I assume Julius already explained his physical abnormalities, but Matthew could feel.

32:44.980 --> 32:46.980
Matthew could kind of talk.

32:46.980 --> 32:57.980
He could communicate after a while in his own way through, you know, bits of squeaks, but seemingly had a human vocal cord set on him.

32:57.980 --> 33:07.980
So the squeaks were varied enough to where, you know, I could make out kind of the situation and we would talk for hours.

33:08.980 --> 33:10.980
They fucking took him.

33:13.980 --> 33:14.980
The firm?

33:14.980 --> 33:15.980
The firm.

33:15.980 --> 33:16.980
The seventh.

33:17.980 --> 33:19.980
Whatever you want to call them.

33:19.980 --> 33:20.980
The government.

33:20.980 --> 33:22.980
The United States of America.

33:22.980 --> 33:26.980
Dad, we found a place where there's a lot of Matthews.

33:26.980 --> 33:27.980
Hey, what do you mean?

33:27.980 --> 33:30.980
The whole Godel thing we were talking about?

33:30.980 --> 33:32.980
How it's big and it's bad?

33:32.980 --> 33:34.980
There are animal people there, sure.

33:34.980 --> 33:35.980
I don't know if they're Matthews.

33:35.980 --> 33:37.980
Yeah, it seems like maybe some of these could talk.

33:37.980 --> 33:39.980
Like really just talk talk.

33:39.980 --> 33:45.980
We had discussed these being separate, whole separate deals and perhaps leading an army of the rat men to defeat these other animal people.

33:45.980 --> 33:48.980
You never saw another rat man like Matthew?

33:48.980 --> 33:58.980
No, I wish I wish I could have. I wish I would have made friends with the whole army, but no, just Matthew.

33:59.980 --> 34:00.980
Oh.

34:02.980 --> 34:03.980
I hope he's okay.

34:03.980 --> 34:06.980
Did you ever find out like where he came from?

34:07.980 --> 34:26.980
He used to draw this, you know, I tried different ways of communicating with him and anytime that he could get his hands on something to, you know, make a design with or draw something out, it was the same design over and over and he grabs a notebook and starts sketching and

34:26.980 --> 34:30.980
Beck is rewinding through his footage to get to the it pit.

34:30.980 --> 34:45.980
And he holds up a sketch right as you arrive at the footage of the it pit and there is a singular difference actually between the design that he is sketched.

34:45.980 --> 34:49.980
It does not have an upside down cross.

34:50.980 --> 34:52.980
All the other symbols are present.

34:52.980 --> 34:54.980
It didn't have an upside down cross.

34:54.980 --> 34:57.980
I see the upside down church when I smell God.

34:57.980 --> 35:03.980
We were in Godel Gorge and this was scrawled on the walls of a really fucking terrible place, dude.

35:03.980 --> 35:05.980
Oh, we've been in the it pit, baby.

35:05.980 --> 35:07.980
I think it's where they kept the animal people.

35:07.980 --> 35:09.980
Yeah, and that's what he's, yeah.

35:10.980 --> 35:12.980
How long have they been doing this?

35:12.980 --> 35:13.980
Oh my God.

35:13.980 --> 35:14.980
Since before you were alive.

35:14.980 --> 35:16.980
I think we gotta go back.

35:17.980 --> 35:19.980
Dad, they have like jumpy, bouncy sidewalks?

35:19.980 --> 35:29.980
I mean, we know for sure now Matthew has some connection to Godel's Gorge.

35:29.980 --> 35:30.980
It would appear that way.

35:30.980 --> 35:38.980
And Kaylee got her yeast that makes her want to eat people or they go in her stomach or something and that's from Godel.

35:38.980 --> 35:40.980
It made her go crazy.

35:40.980 --> 35:43.980
The same happened to Dr. Brock apparently.

35:43.980 --> 35:45.980
Who knows who else?

35:45.980 --> 35:51.980
And every time I've smelled that yeast, yeasts, I see the upside down church.

35:51.980 --> 35:55.980
Yeast, you've smelled what's in the bag, but we think they put what's in the bag in the yeasts.

35:55.980 --> 36:02.980
Well, either way, it's the same trigger and it makes me see the upside down church with blood and bodies and I smell God.

36:02.980 --> 36:07.980
I see like visions of like things happened and things that are happening.

36:07.980 --> 36:09.980
I haven't seen the church myself yet.

36:09.980 --> 36:10.980
And Fred's not dead?

36:10.980 --> 36:12.980
Oh yeah, what's that about?

36:12.980 --> 36:14.980
Why does he want to pretend that he's dead?

36:14.980 --> 36:20.980
Maybe to, uh, hell, I don't know. I just cover the news.

36:20.980 --> 36:24.980
I don't want to make sense of it.

36:24.980 --> 36:28.980
That's for the historians.

36:28.980 --> 36:33.980
Julius turns off his maps and is going to start driving towards the bridge.

36:33.980 --> 36:40.980
Uh, Julius, seems you turned away from beer-y-ah tacos.

36:40.980 --> 36:43.980
Yeah. Um, are we not going to the taco?

36:43.980 --> 36:46.980
I think we gotta go. I think, I think we gotta go.

36:46.980 --> 36:47.980
To?

36:47.980 --> 36:48.980
To the hole.

36:48.980 --> 37:02.980
Oh, no, I'd rather not. I've got to meet, uh, a mysterious caller at a jazz den tonight.

37:02.980 --> 37:06.980
Julius is just going to kind of blankly stare ahead and keep driving.

37:06.980 --> 37:10.980
Are you, you're thinking about jumping into the hole? Is that what your plan is here?

37:10.980 --> 37:11.980
I don't know, maybe.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.980
Uh, Burl, can you speak to your boy here?

37:13.980 --> 37:20.980
Well, I mean, if he wants to go down the hole, we're going to need, what, some sort of scuba gear?

37:20.980 --> 37:23.980
And like backup, like a lot of backup.

37:23.980 --> 37:26.980
We've talked about this. It's, it's really dumb to go there right now.

37:26.980 --> 37:34.980
We should bring, if not an army of rat men, I don't know, some, uh,

37:34.980 --> 37:37.980
do you have any mean friends?

37:37.980 --> 37:43.980
Julius immediately starts thinking of all the people he's met through Delta Green.

37:43.980 --> 37:45.980
Oh, do you remember any numbers?

37:45.980 --> 37:46.980
Uh, yeah.

37:46.980 --> 37:49.980
Three, six.

37:49.980 --> 37:51.980
Do you remember anyone's numbers?

37:51.980 --> 37:52.980
Yeah.

37:52.980 --> 37:54.980
He starts heading back to Buri, uh, taco.

37:54.980 --> 37:57.980
Should we like rally your guys' troops?

37:57.980 --> 38:02.980
Oh, this could be fun. Get the old crew back together. Well, not the last old crew, but-

38:02.980 --> 38:04.980
No, they got caught. No offense.

38:04.980 --> 38:06.980
Oh, maybe the bog job? Bog job crew?

38:06.980 --> 38:08.980
Yeah, bog job crew.

38:08.980 --> 38:09.980
Yeah.

38:09.980 --> 38:11.980
Should we tell Diggory?

38:11.980 --> 38:14.980
No, I think we should absolutely not tell Diggory.

38:14.980 --> 38:18.980
Okay. Maybe we should bring that doctor with us.

38:18.980 --> 38:20.980
And he looks at Cal and Beck.

38:20.980 --> 38:21.980
Are you kidnapping us?

38:21.980 --> 38:22.980
No, we're-

38:22.980 --> 38:29.980
I mean, I'm not fucking going either. We're going to hang back, I think, and they're going to go down the hole with the crew.

38:29.980 --> 38:31.980
Wait, Stevie, you don't- I mean like-

38:31.980 --> 38:33.980
No, I'm not fucking going down there. Are you kidding me?

38:33.980 --> 38:39.980
I don't exactly want to either, but like, we've been working on this for a while now. We need to see it through to the end, don't you?

38:39.980 --> 38:45.980
You saw what that was down there. I'm with Cal. We're not going down there unless we have an army of Ant-Man coming in behind us.

38:45.980 --> 38:46.980
This doesn't- yeah.

38:46.980 --> 38:51.980
Right. I'm not saying we go now. I'm saying we call up our guys. We go get some tacos.

38:51.980 --> 38:54.980
But who needs the bog job guys when you've got the US Marines?

38:54.980 --> 38:55.980
I don't know if-

38:55.980 --> 38:59.980
I mean, the bog job guys are kind of more up for this sort of challenge.

38:59.980 --> 39:01.980
And the Marines might-

39:01.980 --> 39:04.980
What's the world sees what's going on there in our news story?

39:04.980 --> 39:07.980
Do you think the Godels and the Marines don't work together?

39:07.980 --> 39:09.980
The boys got a point.

39:10.980 --> 39:12.980
The Navy then.

39:25.980 --> 39:27.980
And it's all mine

39:34.980 --> 39:39.980
Cause my life is great

39:39.980 --> 39:54.980
So out of character, in my head, I was like, oh shit, if Julius and his dad want to go down with a couple of dudes from the bog job, you guys could create characters that are the bog job crew.

39:54.980 --> 39:59.980
That would be fun. And then we could send that crew in together into the hole.

39:59.980 --> 40:00.980
Yeah. I like that.

40:00.980 --> 40:01.980
That would be cool.

40:01.980 --> 40:02.980
That sounds fun.

40:02.980 --> 40:03.980
Totally.

40:03.980 --> 40:04.980
And then Cal and Beck don't die.

40:04.980 --> 40:05.980
Exactly.

40:06.980 --> 40:10.980
We could just strap GoPros to our heads. That way it's documented.

40:10.980 --> 40:13.980
Perfect. That's what I'm talking about right there.

40:13.980 --> 40:17.980
And Burl Summers is now going to be my Pat Jack Nicholson impression.

40:17.980 --> 40:21.980
She went, Jack, it's a good choice for your whole creepy, weird, evil vibe.

40:21.980 --> 40:23.980
Yeah. I was just going higher.

40:23.980 --> 40:25.980
It's more sinister that way.

40:25.980 --> 40:26.980
Yeah.

40:27.980 --> 40:40.980
Well, maybe, uh, I mean, if you guys, you know, I, I understand you don't want to come like my dad and I we've been fighting this shit for years, but I mean, you can talk your way out of stuff, but I don't know about in Godel's Gorge really.

40:40.980 --> 40:43.980
What if you just flew a drone down with us?

40:45.980 --> 40:48.980
No, no, no.

40:49.980 --> 40:51.980
No, Cal, let's think about that.

40:51.980 --> 40:53.980
Let's not think about that.

40:53.980 --> 40:57.980
We would get the footage we need and no harm would be coming our way.

40:57.980 --> 41:01.980
No harm? No harm? From those robot freaks? No harm?

41:03.980 --> 41:05.980
I would be in complete control, Cal.

41:05.980 --> 41:07.980
I don't trust drones.

41:07.980 --> 41:08.980
Why?

41:11.980 --> 41:12.980
It's not...

41:12.980 --> 41:13.980
Okay, I'm sorry.

41:13.980 --> 41:14.980
I pull Stevia's eye.

41:14.980 --> 41:15.980
Cal, yeah.

41:15.980 --> 41:16.980
They scare him.

41:16.980 --> 41:17.980
Yeah, clearly.

41:17.980 --> 41:22.980
No, Cal, I would be in total control of it. There wouldn't even be any kind of AI sentience on board.

41:22.980 --> 41:24.980
What about a flying camera instead?

41:24.980 --> 41:35.980
We got the job done just well enough in my day without flying cameras or, or, or the G-spot or, or any of this newfangled nonsense.

41:40.980 --> 41:42.980
The news was serviceable and accurate.

41:43.980 --> 41:47.980
Julius looks at it back and just kind of shrugs and winks like, yeah, sure, we won't.

41:47.980 --> 41:48.980
Yeah, we just won't.

41:48.980 --> 41:51.980
You can watch, you can watch our GoPro head, head footage.

41:51.980 --> 41:53.980
Perfect. Okay, just the GoPros.

41:54.980 --> 41:57.980
I think I've got some of their numbers still and Julius starts going through his phone.

41:57.980 --> 42:04.980
He searches bog and it's like, it's like J-bog, Q-bog.

42:06.980 --> 42:08.980
All right, who's J and who's Q?

42:09.980 --> 42:10.980
My name's Joe.

42:11.980 --> 42:12.980
Perfect.

42:12.980 --> 42:14.980
That won't be confusing at all.

42:15.980 --> 42:18.980
I mean, it'd be less confusing if, like, if I was Joe.

42:35.980 --> 42:38.980
Oh shit, what the fuck? Is this thing on?

42:38.980 --> 42:47.980
Ah, hey, it's Wolf and I'm here with a brand new track that'll make you smack your dad for not introducing it to you sooner.

42:47.980 --> 42:50.980
It's Time Walk with War.

43:08.980 --> 43:24.980
Destroy

43:24.980 --> 43:31.980
Vacuus

43:31.980 --> 43:35.980
Conquer

43:35.980 --> 43:42.980
War

43:42.980 --> 43:48.980
Welcome, everyone, to somewhere in the middle of episode 36 of season two of Pretending to be People.

43:48.980 --> 43:56.980
And we are blessed, we are honored, we are humbled and fucking stoked to have a guest joining us this evening.

43:56.980 --> 43:59.980
You may know her from season three of the Glass Cannon Network's Get in the Trunk.

43:59.980 --> 44:07.980
You may know her from Time for Chaos, the GCN's playthrough of Massenar Lethetepe, or their live shows, or their upcoming show Gatewalkers.

44:07.980 --> 44:11.980
You may know her as the queen of new game whodis.

44:11.980 --> 44:14.980
It's Kate Stamets!

44:19.980 --> 44:21.980
I forgot I did all those things. I was like, season three of what?

44:24.980 --> 44:27.980
How was that? How was playing Delta Green with, uh, with Glass Cannon?

44:27.980 --> 44:32.980
That was fun. I think that was the one season that Grant ran, so, like, it was just fun.

44:32.980 --> 44:38.980
I like, like, usually Troy's the one who, like, runs us through things, so it's always fun having someone else run me through something.

44:38.980 --> 44:46.980
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Any time I can convince one of these other folks to take the, take the reins, uh, I enjoy it thoroughly.

44:46.980 --> 44:52.980
He really likes, um, getting to inflict revenge as a player for all the plans of his we've messed up.

44:52.980 --> 44:53.980
Sounds right.

44:53.980 --> 44:57.980
I'm running a game on Tuesday, and I think you're gonna die, probably.

44:57.980 --> 44:58.980
Oh, hell yeah.

44:58.980 --> 45:04.980
It's best to just sideline his character as quickly as possible to make things, make things go a lot smoothly.

45:04.980 --> 45:10.980
Well, Kate, for those of our listeners who aren't familiar with all that rad shit that you've been up to, how'd you, uh-

45:10.980 --> 45:12.980
Did you say rat shit or rad shit?

45:12.980 --> 45:13.980
All that rat-

45:13.980 --> 45:14.980
Same thing.

45:14.980 --> 45:16.980
Rat shit that you've been up to?

45:16.980 --> 45:25.980
How'd you, how'd you dive into, uh, role-playing? What got you started in this hobby?

45:25.980 --> 45:29.980
Well, so, like, my husband and I, like, we had, like, this itch we needed to scratch.

45:29.980 --> 45:31.980
That sounds weird when I say my husband.

45:31.980 --> 45:33.980
It sounds like the start of a great delta gaming scenario.

45:33.980 --> 45:35.980
It's hard to play games like this when you're older.

45:35.980 --> 45:42.980
Like, it's hard to find a group to play with, someone to run you through it, so we played with, like, um, at, like, a local shop near us in Brooklyn.

45:42.980 --> 45:50.980
It's like you paid, I don't remember how much it was, and someone there runs you and other people that are local through, like, an encounter. It was D&D 5E.

45:50.980 --> 45:58.980
For those of you who can't see Kate, she seems to be in her 70s or 80s, so it's hard to find, you know, people your age to, to play with. That's not true.

45:58.980 --> 46:00.980
You just said you were older, and I was like, wait, what?

46:00.980 --> 46:08.980
No, no, I mean, like, it's hard to find, like, other people who are gonna make the same amount of commitment, like, they want, like, I wanna play all the time, and-

46:08.980 --> 46:09.980
Yes.

46:09.980 --> 46:22.980
Like, finding someone who wants to GM, it's, like, hard, so we did that, and that helped for a minute, but we were playing with strangers, and then I kinda accidentally started playing with Glass Cannon, so, like, I'm, I'm good now, my itch is scratched.

46:22.980 --> 46:23.980
Hell yeah.

46:23.980 --> 46:24.980
Just like saying.

46:24.980 --> 46:25.980
Trying to find a way out of it.

46:25.980 --> 46:27.980
You're like, how do I get on this fucking train?

46:27.980 --> 46:30.980
I think we're gonna get real itchy tonight.

46:30.980 --> 46:31.980
Real itchy tonight?

46:31.980 --> 46:32.980
Yeah.

46:32.980 --> 46:33.980
Yeah, well-

46:33.980 --> 46:34.980
In the bog.

46:34.980 --> 47:02.980
There's a lot to get through, I realized, as I was, uh, writing for this arc, because it starts on Tuesday, April 18th, 2017, and the text at the bottom of the screen in your mind types out the date as we set our scene here in the past, over five years before this absurd jailbreak that just took place in the present day of Thursday, July 7th, 2022.

47:02.980 --> 47:14.980
But, back here in the spring of 2017, we see a team of six making their way through soppingly saturated soil in thick, dense woods.

47:14.980 --> 47:19.980
Now, let's get a brief rundown of who's who on this job before we dive in.

47:19.980 --> 47:23.980
First off, we already know Burl and Julius Summers are here.

47:23.980 --> 47:25.980
Burl looks almost the exact same.

47:25.980 --> 47:34.980
He's a sinewy, middle-aged dude with long, black, stringy hair and three long whiskers on his chin.

47:34.980 --> 47:38.980
Luke, what's Julius' vibe five years ago, 2017? Any different? Same?

47:38.980 --> 47:43.980
He, uh, would be, let's see, math is so hard.

47:43.980 --> 47:44.980
Nuts.

47:44.980 --> 47:45.980
24 years old.

47:45.980 --> 47:46.980
That's 29 minus 5.

47:46.980 --> 47:53.980
That is. I mean, he's basically the same Julius, just younger, huge thighs, just hanging out with his dad.

47:53.980 --> 47:58.980
Hanging out with his dad. So, huge thighs. What are you wearing in this boggy sort of environment?

47:58.980 --> 48:02.980
I assume everyone has, like, big rubber boots on to kind of trudge their way through this situation.

48:02.980 --> 48:19.980
He's looking very Duck Dynasty. He's got, like, a camo thermal sweater on, camo cargo pants, big rubber duck boots, and, uh, yeah.

48:19.980 --> 48:20.980
Rat.

48:20.980 --> 48:21.980
Rat.

48:21.980 --> 48:34.980
And, uh, then we see, leading the group, there's a local guide with this team, kind of taking the front of the pack, making their way through this boggy terrain.

48:34.980 --> 48:39.980
And that is going to be Mr. Judt Harry.

48:39.980 --> 48:46.980
Yeah, that's me. That's, uh, that's Norman Sumter. People who know him call him Stump.

48:47.980 --> 48:55.980
Uh, he's got this, he's got long, long, long gray hair that he keeps in a real nice tight ponytail that runs down his back.

48:55.980 --> 49:01.980
And he's got equally gray and straight and thin and long gray beard down the front.

49:01.980 --> 49:07.980
He's wearing, uh, these aviator glasses that he can flip up, have shades as a flip up there.

49:07.980 --> 49:16.980
And, uh, his teeth are kind of bad and he's kind of, he's kind of thin and scraggly all over, but he's also a little bit like live on his feet.

49:16.980 --> 49:23.980
And he looks like there's kind of a, an intensity to him. And, uh, yeah, he's kind of leading this group right now.

49:23.980 --> 49:28.980
And he's, uh, he, he, it looks like he is Legolas-ing his way through these woods.

49:28.980 --> 49:34.980
He's seeing things that you guys aren't seeing and he's pointing at things and he's doing maneuvers with his hands that you guys kind of understand.

49:35.980 --> 49:37.980
And he's not saying a goddamn word to Frodo.

49:39.980 --> 49:41.980
What kind of music does he like?

49:41.980 --> 49:42.980
Good question.

49:43.980 --> 49:47.980
Oh, he's, uh, CCR for sure. REO Speedwagon.

49:47.980 --> 49:50.980
Just touring the county fairs of America.

49:50.980 --> 49:51.980
Uh-huh. Styx.

49:52.980 --> 49:54.980
Hell yeah, dude. Come sail away.

49:54.980 --> 50:00.980
Midway through the group, we've got a, uh, a young woman compared to Stump.

50:00.980 --> 50:03.980
Caitlin Stamets. Who, who do we see here?

50:03.980 --> 50:12.980
You see a 35 year old, like light blonde sugar, sort of length hair, brown eyes. Her name's Phoebe, Phoebe Richards.

50:12.980 --> 50:19.980
She's a millennial in tech, but then she also has like a woo woo side, which I think is what the kids are calling that these days.

50:19.980 --> 50:28.980
Um, so like she's really smart and gifted. She's a computer scientist, but she also like, you know, always has a clear quartz in her bra.

50:28.980 --> 50:37.980
Um, she, she wears sock martens. She's like mildly alt. She might have an iced coffee as she like rolls up to you and she's like swishing it.

50:42.980 --> 50:49.980
And then, uh, another, is it an old man, Thomas? Are you playing an old man? Just a middle aged man? When I, when I read your character.

50:49.980 --> 50:50.980
There's an age.

50:50.980 --> 50:54.980
There's an age. Well, I'm going to stop talking about your character. Just tell me about him.

50:54.980 --> 51:00.980
There's a young man at this point, five years younger than when you'll see him later. Uh, he's about 25 at this point.

51:00.980 --> 51:07.980
Um, I don't think anybody would call him a stud, uh, unless they confused him for like a, a plank of wood.

51:07.980 --> 51:19.980
He is, he's live, but real bony, just in all the wrong ways. He's covered in more grit and dirt than it seems like he could have accrued in the time they've been out here.

51:19.980 --> 51:30.980
So it must've been on him from the start. He's wearing like tan overalls and a t-shirt that was probably white at one point, but it's just covered in mysterious, like black powders and things.

51:30.980 --> 51:40.980
And you can't really see his face because he's just got this mass of messy, like thick hair and these giant Coke bottle glasses that are kind of peeking out through it.

51:40.980 --> 51:43.980
He looks like a weird straw robot almost.

51:43.980 --> 51:47.980
Amazing. Oh, I love that. And what was his name?

51:47.980 --> 51:51.980
Mo Gibson. Mo Gibson. Mo Gibson.

51:51.980 --> 51:59.980
The sixth person you see in this crew, right? One, two, three, four, five, six. Yeah, the sixth person is Agent Lee.

51:59.980 --> 52:19.980
Agent Lee is a fresh faced gentleman from Langley and he is, unfortunately for him, wearing his like suit and dress shoes in this bog, tied, tied tight all the way up to the top, top button, buttoned.

52:19.980 --> 52:27.980
And he is just constantly complaining about his dress shoes getting wet.

52:27.980 --> 52:40.980
And he's talking about how he's going to have blisters later, but this team, your team is trudging through the isolated wetlands that are the Southern Appalachian mountain bogs of North Carolina.

52:40.980 --> 52:56.980
You were sent here under the guise of official government business to find out why construction has been repeatedly halted on a refined oil pipeline being installed through this almost entirely uninhabited landscape, uninhabited landscape.

52:56.980 --> 53:14.980
And when you finally made it to the job site with the necessary help of your local guide, Stump, you found it abandoned. Mobile trailers, big yellow machines for excavation, stacks and stacks of pipe segments all sat silently undisturbed, stagnant.

53:14.980 --> 53:22.980
And after exploring the base of operations further, no paperwork has been touched nor checklists marked off in three days.

53:22.980 --> 53:27.980
And that's when you heard the voice of your local guide holler out that he'd found something strange.

53:27.980 --> 53:31.980
Found something strange!

53:31.980 --> 53:40.980
Didn't even put anything in my little notes here. I was hoping that would happen.

53:40.980 --> 53:44.980
Look at how weird this is folks. Come here.

53:44.980 --> 53:52.980
And the weird thing that Norman Sumter, aka Stump, is kind of like poking at, maybe like even lifting it out like of the mud with a multi-tool.

53:52.980 --> 53:59.980
He's found a thick braided rope covered in the mud of the bog like it had been buried.

53:59.980 --> 54:10.980
And a couple crews worth of footsteps on either side leading away, lead away from the job site, deeper into the wooded and wet bog lands.

54:10.980 --> 54:16.980
And giving this rope a solid tug, it was clearly anchored at the unknown end.

54:16.980 --> 54:25.980
And after some back and forth, your group decided that a single agent would follow the dirty rope as the rest of the squad, still led by Stump,

54:25.980 --> 54:32.980
would follow within sight and off to the side a bit as to not all walk the same path as the missing crewman.

54:32.980 --> 54:33.980
It's a rope!

54:33.980 --> 54:36.980
Wait, follow the dirty rope into the bog?

54:36.980 --> 54:37.980
That's right.

54:37.980 --> 54:38.980
Oh wow.

54:38.980 --> 54:45.980
And your guys' team drew straws. Basically what we're doing here, you guys are going to play your characters in a second,

54:45.980 --> 54:55.980
but we're doing a flashback and so I'm doing a lot of like explaining what happened leading up to where we're going to kick off and then we'll dive in.

54:55.980 --> 54:57.980
Oh no man, I'm all about the rope talk.

54:57.980 --> 55:00.980
Yeah. Can you describe it even more?

55:00.980 --> 55:07.980
Now this here is natural. A lot of people think that rope does just pop up and ball from time to time. This is not natural. This is an unknown rope.

55:07.980 --> 55:11.980
It's strangely fibrous. Does anyone have biology?

55:11.980 --> 55:19.980
How could a rope be strangely fibrous? They're so fibrous.

55:19.980 --> 55:27.980
It's strangely fibrous if anyone is adept with, if anyone has a knowledge of rope.

55:27.980 --> 55:29.980
I actually have that written down here.

55:29.980 --> 55:30.980
Or any sort of biology.

55:30.980 --> 55:35.980
I gave myself craft improvised contraptions. Does this appear to be an improvised contraption?

55:35.980 --> 55:38.980
Hey, I'll answer that since you took it. It does not.

55:38.980 --> 55:39.980
Perfect.

55:39.980 --> 55:46.980
This entire group is making their way through kind of watching as Agent Lee drew the short straw.

55:46.980 --> 55:53.980
And he's the one who has to follow the rope through the bog as the rest of you are kind of behind off to the side following through.

55:53.980 --> 55:59.980
And it wasn't long before the job site behind you was completely obscured by the landscape.

55:59.980 --> 56:07.980
And it wasn't much longer until the path ahead of you all opened up and you found the missing construction workers.

56:07.980 --> 56:11.980
There must have been at least 40 of them.

56:11.980 --> 56:12.980
There must be at least 40 of them.

56:12.980 --> 56:14.980
Half buried upside down.

56:14.980 --> 56:16.980
Was 40 of them.

56:16.980 --> 56:19.980
In the soppingly saturated soil.

56:19.980 --> 56:21.980
Hey, Stump, is this normal?

56:21.980 --> 56:23.980
Strangely, in rows.

56:23.980 --> 56:26.980
Mud covered rubber boots pointing to heaven.

56:26.980 --> 56:27.980
Jeans below.

56:27.980 --> 56:30.980
Highlighter work vests just visible.

56:30.980 --> 56:35.980
The majority of their torsos fully down in the muck.

56:35.980 --> 56:41.980
Their arms and heads making up the root systems of these human beings planted like crops in a field.

56:41.980 --> 56:43.980
Silent.

56:43.980 --> 56:44.980
Undisturbed.

56:44.980 --> 56:46.980
Stagnant.

56:46.980 --> 56:50.980
And you smell something other than the dampened decay of the bog.

56:50.980 --> 56:53.980
Unsettling due to its lack of congruency with its setting.

56:53.980 --> 56:56.980
It's a delicate floral fragrance.

56:56.980 --> 56:59.980
And that's when Agent Lee screams.

56:59.980 --> 57:03.980
The rope in his hands is now emanating a bioluminescent glow.

57:03.980 --> 57:07.980
And he succeeds his role.

57:07.980 --> 57:11.980
So he is struggling as he's trying to keep this radiant potential gar-

57:11.980 --> 57:12.980
Garret?

57:12.980 --> 57:13.980
Garot?

57:13.980 --> 57:14.980
Garote?

57:14.980 --> 57:15.980
Garot?

57:15.980 --> 57:19.980
The rope that goes around your neck a noose of some sort from looping itself around his neck.

57:19.980 --> 57:26.980
And now we're going to jump in, in turn-based action, starting with whoever has the highest dexterity.

57:26.980 --> 57:29.980
Call him out! Who's got dexterity?

57:29.980 --> 57:30.980
I have 70.

57:30.980 --> 57:31.980
I have 60.

57:31.980 --> 57:32.980
60.

57:32.980 --> 57:33.980
Uh, 65.

57:33.980 --> 57:35.980
65. Stunt.

57:35.980 --> 57:36.980
55.

57:36.980 --> 57:38.980
55.

57:38.980 --> 57:45.980
Julius Summers, you are kicking things off. Remind us what you look like and how you react to this situation.

57:45.980 --> 57:56.980
Julius is, yeah, wearing full camo, got the rubber boots on, and he- this is pretty- this isn't, like, one of the worst things he's ever seen.

57:56.980 --> 58:06.980
But, uh, it's still not great, so he's gonna go and, like, just pick up one of the boots and just, like, see if there's anything in it.

58:06.980 --> 58:09.980
There's a foot in it. Who had 65 dexterity?

58:09.980 --> 58:10.980
Me.

58:10.980 --> 58:11.980
You're up.

58:12.980 --> 58:17.980
Mo Mo vomits all over the swamp.

58:17.980 --> 58:20.980
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. That's gross.

58:20.980 --> 58:21.980
Yeah.

58:21.980 --> 58:24.980
It's nasty. There was a foot in that boot. Who had- who had 60 dex?

58:24.980 --> 58:26.980
There's a foot in my boot.

58:26.980 --> 58:29.980
So the rope is attacking Agent Lee.

58:29.980 --> 58:44.980
Who's about, maybe, 20 feet away from you, and you've opened up yourselves, like, you've walked out into this sort of open, boggy field, uh, that this rope is coming out of, and this is the field in which all these humans are planted upside down, boots to heaven.

58:44.980 --> 58:47.980
How do we feel about Agent Lee? Do we like him?

58:47.980 --> 58:48.980
Do I care?

58:48.980 --> 58:52.980
He didn't have the sense to not dress like a man in black in the fucking bog.

58:52.980 --> 58:53.980
Seems uptight.

58:53.980 --> 59:00.980
So, like, I guess what she would be wondering is, is this rope coming out the ground, like, where we are?

59:00.980 --> 59:11.980
Yeah, so, as you, uh, you can roll, um, a search, um, in order to see if, uh, if you can make out where it's, where it's coming from.

59:11.980 --> 59:13.980
Yeah, get those dice, we're gonna roll them!

59:13.980 --> 59:19.980
Okay, search, okay, not that bad. Uh, okay, D100s. Got it, got it, okay.

59:20.980 --> 59:22.980
Oh, that's a 9 under 40!

59:22.980 --> 59:24.980
Yay! Starting off good.

59:25.980 --> 59:32.980
Phoebe, you see this rope, and you see, you notice that the bioluminescence is, uh, is, is kind of, like, uh, following it,

59:32.980 --> 59:38.980
and, and the rope that's tying itself around his neck is kind of heading into the middle of where all these people are buried,

59:38.980 --> 59:47.980
and you see a slight glow kind of underneath the muck and the bog, and you can make out exactly where it's emanating from,

59:47.980 --> 59:51.980
and it's only about ten feet in front of you.

59:51.980 --> 59:55.980
I wish I had, like, a knife on me, because then I'd just try to chop the rope.

59:55.980 --> 59:57.980
Whoa, what's that in your back pocket?

59:57.980 --> 59:58.980
I feel like I'd have one.

59:58.980 --> 01:00:00.980
Why wouldn't you? It'd be nuts!

01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:03.980
I'd definitely have a sharp crystal in my bra, at least.

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:11.980
Um, I want to try to, I feel like the, by default move, I'd want to go up and try to chop the rope, yeah.

01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:13.980
Go ahead and roll a melee weapons attack.

01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:20.980
Oh, no. Well, that's not the worst, either. But that's a bad roll. That's a 96 over 30.

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.980
That's a critical failure.

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:23.980
So, here's the thing-

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:25.980
My iced coffee's still in my hand.

01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:31.980
Here's the thing, Kate. Um, we're children, and-

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:33.980
No, we're very, very clever men.

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:39.980
And so, 69 is the most critical success you can roll, and therefore-

01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:41.980
No, no, no, no, no, it's a 96. It was a 96.

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:43.980
I know, therefore-

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:44.980
But therefore-

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:45.980
Oh, no!

01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:46.980
Yeah.

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:49.980
No, no, I think that's what, uh, Glass Cannon does, also.

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.980
Oh, no, it's 86 is the worst one, not 96.

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:52.980
Oh, that's funny.

01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:53.980
That's funny.

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:54.980
I think.

01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:55.980
I like that.

01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:56.980
Yeah.

01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:57.980
Kitchen humor.

01:00:57.980 --> 01:00:58.980
We were just like, the opposite.

01:00:58.980 --> 01:00:59.980
Yeah.

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:04.980
We're like, not doing that.

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:05.980
The worst.

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:15.980
Alright, so, as you drop your iced coffee directly into the bog, a significant amount of bog water starts combining itself

01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:24.980
inside the open top of your iced coffee, and there is very little chance that you're gonna want to drink any of that.

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:25.980
That is-

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:28.980
That is the worst thing that could ever happen to me. Thank you for-

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:31.980
I mean, don't- Wow, that was the worst.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:32.980
And as you trip forward-

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:36.980
That's one of the most upsetting things I've heard described in our horror podcast.

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:37.980
That was $7!

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:41.980
Yeah, like, I had such a visceral reaction to that being ruined.

01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:44.980
I'm gonna be tired later.

01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:52.980
As you try to dive forward with your knife, the knife slips out of your hand and disappears into the bog.

01:01:52.980 --> 01:02:02.980
You are on your hands and knees, about six inches deep in this thing, and kind of facing exactly where this bioluminescence is,

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:08.980
and you might be the only one who can see that it is heading directly for you.

01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:11.980
Ooh, I yell, guys, look!

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:12.980
Guys, look!

01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:17.980
Burl Summers is up next, and he heeds your advice, but he rolls a fail as well,

01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:23.980
and he jumps down with a machete in his hand and just kind of slaps it into the water,

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:26.980
hacking at absolutely nothing in his attempt.

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:32.980
His three whiskers coming off of his chin, blowing in the wind, and after him goes,

01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:34.980
Stumpy, Mr. Stumpman.

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:35.980
Save us, Stump!

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:39.980
Stump is pulling a heftier looking knife off of his belt.

01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:44.980
It was sheathed. He had it hanging on a sheath on the edge of his belt, and he pulls that out,

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:50.980
and he wants to lunge, but he's gonna lunge for kind of that center point that it was heading towards.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:54.980
He wants to just dive and slam it down into there.

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:56.980
He's trying to cause damage more than he's trying to cut.

01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:00.980
Okay, awesome. Go ahead and roll melee.

01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:06.980
Because Phoebe called out where it is, you don't have to take a negative, and his fingers are raised.

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:07.980
What is happening?

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:10.980
What do those raised fingers look like?

01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:11.980
The Twin Towers.

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:14.980
An 11. That's a critical success.

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:15.980
Take it all from the top.

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:17.980
It was an 11! Whoa!

01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:19.980
That's a critical success!

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:27.980
Oh shit, dude. Okay, as you dive in, your body dumps down.

01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:29.980
Basically, you've been standing on this bog, right?

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:35.980
It's not that deep. Your feet only go so far into it, especially you floating atop of it like you have been.

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:46.980
But as you dump, as you dump, as you stump in to the water, horizontally, knife out, just stabbing down,

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:56.980
you plant it directly into something, and your body is actually completely underground as well.

01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:57.980
Underground meaning under the water.

01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:04.980
And as everyone sees your body kind of dip under the water, it's that idea of like,

01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:07.980
holy shit, there is a deeper part of the bog right there.

01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:17.980
And then suddenly, from out of the water, rising weightless is this figure, humanoid in tattered clothes,

01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:26.980
and you see that her hair was the rope that is heading off and still trying to take down Agent Lee.

01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:31.980
And your knife is buried directly in the top of her head.

01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:41.980
And she is singing, crying, laughing, all at the same time, and I need everyone to roll con to avoid.

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:44.980
18, I pass.

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:49.980
18 as well, I also pass.

01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:50.980
What?

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:51.980
Hell yeah.

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:52.980
Oh, it's real.

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:53.980
Just under 68.

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:54.980
Nice.

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:55.980
Under 70.

01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:58.980
Well done. Okay, and stump, how'd you do?

01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:04.980
Stump's highest score is his constitution, and it's a 75, and he rolled an 89.

01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:05.980
That's not good.

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:10.980
But it kind of makes sense, because he just kind of rodeoed this thing in the head and is hanging on.

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:21.980
So the rest of you kind of see this, and Joe, Stump has his knife buried into the top of this creature's head,

01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:27.980
and it is laughing or crying or singing directly in your face,

01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:34.980
and the mud and muck across its face is slowly just starting to fall away,

01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:44.980
and you see the skin underneath is so thin and withered away that the bones are almost creaking through and out.

01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:50.980
It's been in the water for so long that it's disintegrating into nothingness,

01:05:50.980 --> 01:06:00.980
and as you hear this noise in your head, these memories are unlocked, and we go immediately back to Stump back in the war.

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:02.980
Please describe the worst thing you've ever done.

01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:06.980
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:07.980
Joe Terry.

01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:15.980
Stump was a sniper spotter in the war, and he got his nickname Stump because he would sit there for sometimes hours,

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:23.980
stock still, just trying to line up a shot, and he'd been there for a while, and his sniper guy was getting restless.

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:27.980
He was like, come on, Stump, you don't have to live up to your name all the time.

01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:33.980
And finally, it got to Stump, and he said, all right, firing line is six degrees north by northwest,

01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:39.980
line up the shot, give it a wind speed of 35, and go.

01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:42.980
And Stump knew that wasn't the right call.

01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:47.980
He wanted to wait a little bit longer, but he felt pressured, and yeah, it hit civilians.

01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:52.980
This bullet ripped through a bunch of people who were standing next to the thing he wanted to hit.

01:06:52.980 --> 01:07:01.980
And as soon as you are replaying that in your mind, you see this entity, this creature that you're face to face with now,

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:07.980
has supplanted itself inside of your memory, and it's watching you do this,

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:17.980
and you are feeling its history of its land just being overtaken repeatedly, and repeatedly, and moved,

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:24.980
and shuffled off to a different location, and its land being burned, and its family being exiled or murdered,

01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:33.980
and you feel the weight of what has been done to this creature in some semblance of a past life on your shoulders

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:39.980
as you know that you did that to people overseas.

01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:49.980
And then the crying stops, and you fall back into the muck, make a splash as these tattered robes,

01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:59.980
these muddy sort of amorphous cloth and textiles kind of dissipates into mud and muck and bog.

01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:11.980
The thick braided hair that you can see loses its bioluminescent glow, and Burl Summers comes up and reaches out his hand to you.

01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:16.980
Son, I think I have a job for you.

01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:32.980
War!

01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:51.980
Destroy!

01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:55.980
Vacuous!

01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:58.980
Conquer!

01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:02.980
War!

01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:11.980
War!

01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:19.980
War!

01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:26.980
War!

01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:31.980
War!

01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:43.980
And then the camera shifts, and we see a little restaurant called Beer Eat A Taco.

01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:49.980
And the text across the bottom of the screen says, July 7th, 2022.

01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:51.980
Joke is just a linguistic mess.

01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:56.980
I think it might be the funniest one we've ever done.
