10320	14840	so that you may be my lifelong loyal listeners.
14840	17220	I think, maybe that was a dream.
17220	20560	Ever since I started eating grease too close to Betty
20560	25200	by time, I've been dreaming up all kinds of crazy shit.
25200	28920	And oh yeah, I'm the host of this here radio show.
28920	33920	Y'all find yourselves tuned into 694.2 PTBP.
35440	39560	All I ask from my hatchlings is for a little love,
39560	43960	maybe a little forehead kiss, or some fan mail.
43960	48080	And hey, would you look at what we got here, y'all?
48080	51160	This episode's Howlin' with Wolf is from Eric
51160	53680	in Jersey City, New Jersey,
53680	56840	who tagged at Pretending Pod on the internet.
56880	59640	Well done, my good and faithful Eric
59640	63120	in Jersey City, New Jersey, Eric writes.

80920	84020	a new cast, and a new story.
84020	89020	And soon, we'll be kicking off a Yellow King RPG campaign,
89140	92540	playing the yet-to-be-released Casilda song
92540	94560	from Pelgrain Press.

104180	108540	Well, New Jersey Eric, I'm glad that my radio show
108540	111180	could be of inspiration to ya,
111180	114700	although I'm not too sure what a RPG is
114700	117500	or what an actual play is.
117500	120480	Are there theoretical play podcasts?
120480	122820	Damn, metaphysical ones.
122820	126240	I gotta start listening to these damn things someday.
126240	129540	If you wanna write up something for your wolf to howl,
129540	132860	just tag at Pretending Pod on the internet
132860	136620	or write up a five-star review and make sure I seize it.
136620	138900	Heck, if you write up a five-star review
138900	141660	and you title that bad boy howling with wolf
141660	143420	or something to that effect,
143420	147260	I might even just read your review right here on air.
147260	149580	And speaking of airwaves,

161480	164800	It's basically like having a tin can on a string
164800	167260	coming into the window of your bedroom,
167260	170780	and that string is strung all the way over to me
170780	173400	here in my current studio,
173400	176500	and it's not attached to a tin can on my end.
176500	178340	Ha ha ha, no way.
178340	180300	It's attached to my soul,
180300	183060	and my greedy soul needs feeding,
183060	187120	so heed my reprieve and hop on that secret feed,

199680	203060	are a side-splittingly goofy two-parter
203060	207100	of the boys playing a mad gab-style party RPG
207100	209140	called The People and Patrick,
209140	211900	wherein they played little alien guys
211900	216740	inside a human Jaeger just trying to fit into society.
216740	218740	And not only do you get access
218740	222500	to that thick bonus feed of 47 episodes
222500	223860	you ain't heard yet,
223860	226500	you also get the satisfaction of knowing

233060	238060	and some guys named Tim, John, Luis, and Zarch,
238460	239860	and that's pretty neat.
239860	242060	Oh, you don't have to type out
242060	245380	HTTPS semicolon slash slash
245380	249940	www.patreon.com slash pretending pod.
249940	253740	That's fine, because the links are in the show notes.
253740	256900	I gave up measuring time in SI.
256900	259140	That's a non-sec-quitter,
259140	262780	but that don't mean it ain't time for the news.
262780	266660	Last time, the can crew had a difficult conversation
266660	269860	with Kaylee Silver, difficult due to the presence
269860	272700	of the bagged waxy substance they carried,
272700	276820	but Kaylee did tell them her best friend, Kaylee Gold,
276820	279060	had gotten partially inside her
279060	282180	after Silver took a swig of a new beer
282180	285860	she had brewed with yeasts from the Godel Company,
285860	290340	and that wasn't even the wildest part of last episode.
290340	293300	Julius kicked off a jailbreak attempt
293300	295780	by breaking his dad's shackles
295780	300540	with Dr. Brock Hargrave's unnaturally sharp shovel,
300540	303540	and after Burl took down some guards,
303540	306260	Julius followed in hot pursuit,
306260	310060	taking us now to the moment between Cal Colorado,
310060	312380	Stevie, and Beck Wilder,
312380	315780	where they decide if they want to follow the summers
315780	318340	or bail with their friends in the air.
318340	321420	It's Alter Girl with My Life Is Great
321420	323980	and It Is All My Fault.
323980	326980	My life is all my fault
326980	331980	Cause my life is great
331980	333980	And it's all mine
341980	345980	Cause my life is great
345980	348980	And it's all my fault
353980	359980	Episode 36, Let's Go
359980	364980	Okay Beck, here we are, standing at the precipice.
364980	366980	We either follow the green line back,
366980	368980	or we follow the bodies.
368980	371980	I mean, I think we should follow the bodies.
371980	375980	I don't want to be caught
375980	377980	without the guys who know what they're doing.
377980	379980	Like, this is weird fucking shit,
379980	381980	and I think that we should follow the bodies.
381980	382980	This is weird fucking shit,
382980	384980	and I think that we should follow the guys
384980	386980	who know how to handle weird fucking shit.
386980	387980	Cal thinks about that,
387980	389980	and he doesn't even bring up the news.
389980	393980	He realizes, like, you're right, this is real shit.
393980	396980	He doesn't have to play act about it.
396980	398980	We need to get the fuck out of here.
398980	401980	Do keep rolling though, but yes, yeah, you're right.
401980	402980	I'm kidding at all.
402980	403980	We should get moving.
403980	404980	We do. We hustle.
404980	405980	Let's go.
405980	406980	Let's go, yeah.
406980	408980	Oh yeah, did you want any input, Stevie?
408980	409980	Nope, absolutely not.
409980	410980	I'm down for whatever.
410980	411980	We got this.
411980	412980	We're not going to take his clothes.
412980	414980	That would be making the news.
414980	415980	We're not going to do that.
415980	416980	We're just running.
416980	417980	Yeah, yeah, let's go.
417980	419980	And running we shall.
423980	425980	Yeah, so you're already at the end of this hallway,
425980	427980	so you bust through the next door.
427980	429980	Bust through.
429980	431980	You probably gently open this next door.
431980	433980	Stevie goes and-
433980	434980	Use the shovel on that door!
434980	436980	Creeps around.
437980	438980	They turn.
438980	439980	They're like, what?
439980	442980	And the shovel goes through the door.
442980	446980	Stevie creeps out through the door and opens it gently
446980	450980	and sticks her head around the corner and turns back to you,
450980	455980	holding one fist in the air and then turning it into two fingers
455980	457980	and jutting them forward like, let's go.
457980	458980	I look at Gal.
458980	461980	Dude, it's like Navy Seal shit.
461980	462980	Navy Seal shit.
462980	463980	Yeah, that was cool.
463980	468980	They keep moving and coming up there is an intersection of the hallway.
468980	471980	So you are in a corridor that continues on straight
471980	473980	and then tees off at the end,
473980	478980	but then there's a hallway that runs through this hallway left and right.
478980	484980	And right as you open the door, you all see Julius and Burl Summers.
484980	487980	And Burl seemed to be counting.
487980	491980	And then you just see Burl grab Julius' shirt collar
491980	495980	and then they run together around the corner to the left,
495980	496980	15 yards away from you.
496980	498980	And sirens are going wild.
498980	501980	What did you mean by seems to be counting?
501980	503980	Is he using his fingers or is he looking at something?
503980	508980	Yeah, using his fingers and counting out loud.
508980	509980	Oh, gotcha.
509980	511980	Do you think he's got the numbers in him?
511980	513980	Oh, Beck, roll grip.
516980	517980	Fuck.
517980	518980	52.
518980	520980	I've rolled a bunch of 50, so I'm retiring these days.
520980	523980	Because I said that or because he saw that?
523980	524980	Because he saw that.
524980	525980	Okay.
525980	528980	Beck, you lose one grip and you are almost positive.
528980	531980	Then I saw an eight and a three and a C.
531980	534980	He held up four fingers on one hand, four fingers on another hand.
534980	536980	Then he held up three fingers on one hand,
536980	539980	and then he held five fingers on one hand and one finger on the other hand.
539980	542980	And you also think maybe he mouthed.
542980	544980	And he said, eight, three, six.
546980	547980	Okay, okay.
547980	549980	I like the first one.
549980	551980	That's not super weird.
551980	553980	I mean, it's the fucking weirdest.
553980	555980	But no, it is weird.
555980	556980	Thank you.
556980	557980	I'm not.
562980	564980	All the eight, three, six stuff is weird.
564980	566980	It's not weird that he was saying it necessarily
566980	569980	because he's the guy who takes care of weird stuff.
569980	571980	And so Julius told him about it.
571980	574980	And so he's, you know, making sure he got it right.
574980	575980	Did I hear you right, son?
575980	576980	Eight, three, six.
576980	577980	Eight, three, six?
577980	578980	Eight, three, six.
578980	582980	Yeah, so, you know, if you want to learn more about it,
582980	584980	we could just follow that guy.
584980	586980	I think we should go and ask him.
588980	589980	Perfect.
589980	591980	Carrot is donkey.
596980	599980	The three of you run forward and turn the corner left.
599980	603980	And as you turn the corner left, you all kind of check your right,
603980	607980	like you're looking both ways before you cross the street almost.
607980	611980	You see no one down either end of the corridor.
612980	615980	And ahead of you, you see Burl and Julius.
615980	617980	And I think we can get Luke in the room.
634980	635980	Which one worked?
635980	636980	I don't know.
637980	638980	Woo!
640980	641980	So...
642980	646980	Julius, Burl counts, lands on the number, grabs you,
646980	651980	turns the corner left, and you all begin making your way down this hallway.
652980	655980	Suddenly, Julius hollers.
655980	657980	What does it mean?
657980	663980	And as Julius hollers that, the blinds on the windows of the rooms
663980	666980	on either side of this corridor flick open.
666980	670980	And he also sees down the end of the hallway, back the way you came,
670980	676980	turning the corner that you just turned, Cal Colorado, Beck Wilder, and Stevie.
676980	678980	Julius, dude! Wait up!
678980	683980	Julius gets super calm all of a sudden and just looks at his dad.
683980	684980	There's your shovel.
684980	688980	The camera does a crazy anime zoom-in on the shovel
688980	692980	tucked underneath Stevie's arm on top of one of the bags.
693980	694980	Come on, guys!
696980	698980	Beck wants to come running up and saying,
698980	700980	What does it mean? Were you asking him about the numbers?
700980	702980	Because I saw him counting numbers!
702980	703980	Was it the 836?
703980	705980	Julius just shrugs, yep.
705980	707980	Fucking what does it mean, he says to Burl.
707980	711980	You weren't supposed to start yelling. They weren't supposed to see us.
711980	717980	And Burl turns and kicks open the door behind him in this hallway.
717980	721980	Julius watches him do it, and what Julius sees is his dad
721980	726980	holding a Nerf gun, just kind of jokingly kicking open the door.
726980	728980	And he looks down and he's got a Nerf gun too.
730980	735980	And he follows his dad, waving the other guys to follow him.
735980	741980	Cal, Beck, and Stevie see officers on either side,
741980	747980	one in each room with the blinds open, one on the left, one on the right.
747980	751980	And they're making their way toward the door into this corridor.
751980	753980	We're going in dexterity order.
753980	754980	Oh, fuck.
754980	755980	Who's up?
755980	756980	I've got a 70.
756980	757980	I've got a 50.
757980	758980	45.
758980	762980	So we started with Julius, who went through the door following his dad.
762980	763980	Correct.
763980	764980	Burl Summers.
764980	769980	And then we have Stevie, who immediately dips, does the same,
769980	773980	and follows, runs with the bag out the door behind Julius.
773980	775980	I would like to do that too.
775980	777980	As well would I.
777980	782980	Okay, so we've got two officers coming in hot pursuit of you all
782980	785980	as you run through this door.
785980	787980	We've got a long hallway.
787980	790980	This next one, we've got a long hallway,
790980	797980	and it has just windows on the left side into the outdoor area
797980	801980	where you see inmates in the hot July sun,
801980	805980	playing basketball, lifting weights, hanging out, playing hacky sack.
805980	810980	There seems to be a group at a table with some, like,
810980	814980	sticks and leaves splayed out in different areas on the table,
814980	817980	and you all are sprinting down this hallway.
817980	820980	I need everyone to roll athletics.
825980	826980	Pass.
827980	828980	Fail.
828980	829980	Critical fail.
829980	830980	88.
831980	833980	Cal trips on his old ass.
836980	837980	Oh, fuck Cal.
837980	839980	Ouchie, ouchie.
839980	840980	My ankle.
843980	844980	Roll a D4.
845980	846980	Ooh, ooh.
846980	847980	Ouchie, ouchie.
847980	848980	Two ouchies.
850980	851980	Carry me back.
853980	858980	I do like a sports carry, you know, getting his arm around my shoulders,
858980	861980	and now we're three-legged racing down the hall.
862980	863980	Okay.
863980	865980	Burl, and did you succeed?
865980	866980	I did.
866980	870980	Burl, Stevie, and Julius all make it to the next door.
870980	873980	Burl blasts through this next door.
873980	874980	Julius?
874980	875980	Following his dad.
875980	876980	Following his dad.
876980	880980	And Stevie stops and looks back.
884980	885980	It's okay, Stevie.
885980	887980	You can go on ahead if you have to.
887980	892980	And Stevie runs toward you, back down this long hallway,
892980	897980	and then past you, and they grab the shovel out from under their arm
897980	903980	and levy it forward as the door opens, and two officers come through it.
903980	904980	Stevie, no!
905980	909980	They miss, and the shovel goes right into the door
909980	914980	and just sinks itself right into the door, and as they pull back,
914980	919980	they pull a massive chunk of the door out with them,
919980	923980	and these two officers are just staring in disbelief,
923980	929980	one of them completely frozen, unable to handle what they just saw.
929980	933980	The shovel went through a door like it was Play-Doh.
933980	937980	The other one loosens their neck and lunges forward,
937980	942980	grabs at the shovel, Stevie pulls it back, and they are locked.
942980	947980	They both have two hands on the shovel, and they're just tugging back and forth.
947980	948980	What do you do, Joe?
948980	951980	Beck wants to pull something out of his pockets
951980	955980	to throw at the feet of the tussle to try and...
955980	957980	He wants it to be in favor of Stevie,
957980	959980	but it's really just they're going to be thrown off balance,
959980	961980	and somebody's going to win that struggle.
961980	963980	Interesting. Okay.
963980	965980	So throwing off their footing?
965980	966980	Yeah.
966980	967980	Okay.
968980	973980	All right, go ahead and roll to see what you end up finding.
973980	975980	I think you can roll a search here,
975980	981980	or you can roll your news skill for going through your camera bag, I guess.
981980	983980	I pass my videographer skill.
983980	984980	Okay, that'll do.
984980	986980	A bunch of mic clips.
986980	987980	Okay, yeah.
987980	990980	Yeah, just little odd-shaped mic clips.
990980	993980	I throw them back there like caltrops.
994980	998980	Good name for a TikTok segment.
1000980	1005980	Fail for Stevie, crit fail for the officer.
1005980	1007980	So kind of maybe worked?
1007980	1009980	Like perfectly worked.
1009980	1016980	The officer who is gripping with two hands on this shovel
1016980	1019980	loses their footing as one of these mic clips
1019980	1021980	just slips right underneath their heel
1021980	1023980	that they were going to put all their pressure on,
1023980	1026980	and it slips out from underneath them.
1026980	1028980	They start falling backwards.
1028980	1030980	Stevie can't hold on.
1030980	1034980	Neither can the officer as they land right on their tailbone,
1034980	1039980	and the shovel falls to the ground next to them.
1039980	1044980	The officer that is kind of dazed is slowly kind of coming out of it,
1044980	1046980	but it's Cal Colorado's turn.
1046980	1050980	Cal wants to try to hobble over there as quickly as he can.
1050980	1053980	Can I try a persuade roll on combat?
1053980	1054980	Yeah, absolutely.
1054980	1056980	He just shouts,
1056980	1060980	Wait, wait, this is a huge misunderstanding.
1060980	1063980	This was just a reenactment for the news.
1063980	1065980	Awesome.
1065980	1068980	Roll persuade.
1068980	1075980	70 on a 80.
1075980	1078980	Fuck yeah.
1078980	1081980	The officer succeeds, but at a lower rate,
1081980	1085980	and they're already blown away by the shovel,
1085980	1087980	and so they connect the dots.
1087980	1089980	This is a prop door.
1089980	1091980	It's a special effect.
1091980	1095980	It's all movie magic, as they say.
1095980	1099980	And he's like, Oh, oh.
1099980	1102980	We're at the city news, so we have pretty a big budget.
1102980	1104980	No, of course, of course.
1104980	1106980	That makes all the sense in the world.
1106980	1110980	Yeah, so sorry about the mic clip thing.
1110980	1112980	You could call the network.
1112980	1114980	Oh, it looks like there's a hole in my pocket.
1114980	1115980	Dang it.
1115980	1117980	They must have all spilled out of there.
1117980	1119980	Probably caught on one of those prison doors, so.
1119980	1121980	Get on up here, Batralamude.
1121980	1122980	Come on.
1122980	1124980	And he helps the other guy up.
1124980	1125980	Batralamude?
1125980	1127980	That's an amazing name.
1127980	1129980	Oh, you know, he doesn't like to talk about it too much.
1129980	1133980	No, I don't.
1133980	1135980	Are we going to be in the news?
1135980	1137980	Batralamude, I wasn't really set up for that shot,
1137980	1139980	but yeah, if you want to go back through that door
1139980	1140980	and wait for your cue.
1140980	1141980	Okay.
1141980	1143980	We'll shout at you when you need to come through.
1143980	1144980	Okay, sounds good.
1144980	1146980	Do we need to reset this door?
1146980	1147980	Reset the door.
1147980	1149980	And if you could also radio ahead to,
1149980	1151980	I think some of your other colleagues
1151980	1153980	might have taken this a little too seriously.
1153980	1156980	Oh, are these alarms like part of your...
1156980	1157980	It's all fake.
1157980	1159980	Well, these are the real alarms.
1159980	1162980	All right, well, yes, but it's a fake scenario, you see.
1162980	1163980	Yeah, okay.
1163980	1164980	For the noose.
1164980	1166980	Hmm, wow.
1166980	1168980	You could just get the word out to not resist.
1168980	1171980	Beck just kind of says into the air,
1171980	1173980	all right, we're going to reset to one.
1173980	1175980	Resetting everybody, resetting everybody.
1175980	1177980	Batralamude, you've been great.
1177980	1178980	Thank you.
1178980	1179980	What was your name, sir?
1179980	1180980	Nah, Jerram.
1180980	1182980	Jerram.
1182980	1184980	Jerram and Batralamude.
1184980	1190980	You two are just for Zach, huh?
1190980	1193980	Didn't know we were going to have so much talking to do.
1193980	1198980	Zach's like, names, names.
1198980	1204980	Jared, big cat, Batralamude.
1204980	1206980	What are they really?
1206980	1207980	What?
1207980	1208980	What are, who are those?
1208980	1209980	What do you mean?
1209980	1210980	In the Bible.
1210980	1211980	Oh.
1211980	1213980	No, I don't think either one of those are...
1213980	1214980	Oh, I assumed.
1214980	1215980	Nope.
1215980	1216980	Okay.
1216980	1217980	Nope.
1217980	1219980	Cool, waste of time.
1220980	1224980	That was the question he was, so.
1224980	1227980	I mean, should I have answered?
1227980	1229980	Yes, and.
1229980	1231980	Nah, I don't do that shit.
1231980	1234980	If the plan is working, they're going back through the door.
1234980	1235980	And we're going.
1235980	1236980	Running away.
1236980	1237980	Yeah, we're leaving.
1237980	1243980	As you run away, Jerram looks through the hole in the door and he's like,
1243980	1247980	I thought you said you were going to reset the door to the...
1247980	1249980	Props department will be here in a minute.
1249980	1251980	We've got to go to makeup.
1251980	1257980	And the three of you run through the next door.
1257980	1261980	And on the other side, you see that.
1261980	1266980	It's so great that this worked.
1266980	1272980	I thought we were going to die.
1272980	1273980	I've had dreams like this.
1273980	1277980	I didn't realize I could just tell them it was for the news.
1277980	1279980	It's for the news.
1279980	1280980	Hey, buddy.
1280980	1283980	Calm down.
1283980	1293980	When the door opens, Julius is pleading with Burl Summers as they stand at the precipice of another corner.
1293980	1296980	And once again, Burl is counting.
1296980	1298980	He looks at Beck.
1298980	1299980	He's doing it again.
1299980	1303980	735, 736, 737.
1303980	1305980	He hasn't said the numbers yet, but it's okay.
1305980	1307980	He's going to say the numbers.
1307980	1308980	We've got to get to him.
1308980	1309980	We've got to get to him.
1309980	1310980	There's still like 100.
1310980	1313980	Yeah, there's a lot of numbers before he gets to the one that I'm scared of.
1313980	1315980	We can knock him over or something.
1315980	1316980	I don't know.
1316980	1319980	I think he's counting to make sure that we go at the right time.
1319980	1320980	He's got the plan.
1320980	1321980	Oh.
1321980	1322980	Oh.
1322980	1327980	And that took me a while to say, so he's probably at a much higher number.
1327980	1328980	812.
1328980	1329980	813.
1329980	1331980	So we're just following the numbers?
1331980	1332980	Did we let him do it?
1332980	1335980	I mean, which way are we going?
1335980	1336980	Point.
1336980	1343980	He points, but then he gives you the don't go hand motion and then holds up a finger.
1343980	1349980	You're about to fucking say 836, and that's going to mean something to you, and I want it to mean something to me.
1349980	1352980	834, 835, 836.
1352980	1353980	Let's go.
1353980	1354980	Fucking told you.
1354980	1355980	And then he dips around the corner.
1355980	1357980	Julius starts running.
1357980	1361980	Beck doesn't immediately go and turns to Stevie and Cal.
1361980	1363980	It's the fucking numbers, but maybe they're a good thing.
1363980	1364980	We gotta go.
1364980	1365980	We gotta go.
1365980	1366980	Let's go.
1366980	1367980	Let's go.
1367980	1368980	Let's go.
1368980	1379980	And at the exact moment that you all turn this corner and start running out, you see a door in the lobby close, and you are now in the lobby, the foyer of this jail.
1379980	1389980	But the way that this escape has been timed out, there's only one person in the area, and it's Officer-
1389980	1390980	Peeler!
1390980	1391980	Peeler!
1391980	1392980	Peeler, open the door!
1392980	1393980	We got it for the shot.
1393980	1396980	Peeler, have you heard about the reenactment for the news?
1396980	1400980	Well, yeah, somebody sent through on the radio about the-
1400980	1403980	We need you to buzz the door open so we don't lose our shot.
1403980	1404980	Hurry!
1404980	1405980	Golden hour, Peeler!
1405980	1406980	Golden hour!
1406980	1409980	And then Julius starts running towards the door, hoping it is gonna open.
1409980	1410980	Awesome.
1410980	1414980	Roll, persuade, probably Cal.
1414980	1416980	75 on an 80.
1416980	1418980	Yes!
1418980	1420980	He succeeds with a 62.
1420980	1421980	Ooh!
1421980	1424980	That would've been scary.
1424980	1433980	As Julius makes it to the door, the red light goes green, and Julius's massive thighs slam into the metal bar that open.
1433980	1434980	Ka-junk!
1434980	1438980	Peeler, out of the lobby and into the world.
1438980	1439980	Woohoo!
1439980	1440980	That was fun!
1440980	1443980	Oh my god, we're gonna get to keep doing this!
1443980	1445980	And he's like looking at his dad, stoked.
1445980	1449980	Beck grabs Burl by the collar and pulls him in.
1449980	1460980	On the front steps of this beautiful city jail with this oppressive architecture, big concrete columns, big concrete stairs.
1460980	1469980	And at the top, where a rocky-like figure might feel victory, Beck feels what?
1469980	1474980	From the outside it would look like anger, but inside it's pleading help.
1474980	1479980	What do they fucking mean?
1479980	1485980	Burl smiles a stringy smile.
1485980	1488980	What is a stringy smile?
1488980	1491980	Oh, it's like, yeah.
1491980	1492980	Saliva-y.
1492980	1497980	His teeth become floss in it.
1497980	1499980	Flossy.
1499980	1502980	Ew, flossy teeth.
1502980	1505980	Somebody just leaves fucking strands trailing.
1505980	1508980	Oh, I call it my baleens.
1508980	1510980	That one over my head.
1510980	1513980	It's the plates that whales use to trap plankton.
1513980	1514980	Oh, nice.
1514980	1515980	Nerd.
1515980	1518980	It's whale teeth.
1518980	1522980	Uh, more people than just nerds watch fucking planet Earth, Luke.
1522980	1526980	Oh, never mind.
1526980	1528980	What, you think just stoners and nerds are watching?
1528980	1529980	There it is.
1529980	1532980	Yeah, no, you're right.
1532980	1535980	Julius is looking at his dad like he wants to know too.
1535980	1537980	I don't know. I'm sorry.
1537980	1539980	Then why say it?
1539980	1541980	It works.
1541980	1543980	It fucking works.
1543980	1544980	We need to go.
1544980	1547980	And he dips down the stairs.
1547980	1548980	Where's your ride?
1548980	1550980	Did we just park in front?
1550980	1551980	Yeah.
1551980	1552980	I think so.
1552980	1553980	I did, yeah.
1553980	1555980	I'll drive if you want.
1555980	1558980	And he kind of just does a little jog down the steps.
1558980	1561980	Like that all didn't just happen.
1561980	1565980	Beep, beep.
1565980	1567980	Can we let them use...
1567980	1570980	What if we just called you guys an Uber or something?
1570980	1571980	That's a betting.
1571980	1573980	That's still a betting.
1573980	1575980	We already abetted.
1575980	1577980	We did the ruse.
1577980	1578980	We abetted.
1578980	1579980	We did do a ruse.
1579980	1580980	We abetted.
1580980	1584980	You're saying in the can van as you're driving away from the crime.
1584980	1586980	The full blown crime.
1586980	1587980	We are a betting.
1587980	1588980	We are a betting.
1588980	1590980	Julius is driving away and just being like,
1590980	1592980	yeah, you guys are in now.
1592980	1596980	I told you.
1596980	1599980	Holy shit.
1599980	1601980	Beck, we're going to have to...
1601980	1602980	We're going to have to...
1602980	1603980	Are you guys hungry?
1603980	1604980	Destroy that footage.
1604980	1606980	I mean, or...
1606980	1607980	Oh, you're right.
1607980	1609980	The honorable thing to do is to send it to the police ourselves.
1609980	1612980	Yeah, but like later.
1612980	1615980	Does Burl have anything to say about that?
1615980	1619980	Burl is just giving you big eyes with a knowing look.
1619980	1621980	He's giving him a little fist bump.
1621980	1622980	Thanks for getting me out.
1622980	1625980	Yeah, I mean, I figured you'd maybe use the shovel,
1625980	1627980	but that was interesting too.
1627980	1628980	Abet, here we are.
1628980	1630980	Well, you use the shovel.
1630980	1631980	True.
1631980	1632980	Anything for you.
1632980	1633980	Are you guys hungry?
1633980	1634980	You're probably hungry.
1634980	1635980	What do you want?
1635980	1638980	Oh, you know what I could really go for is tacos.
1638980	1642980	And Julius is just going to aimlessly drive until he sees tacos.
1642980	1645980	Julius, dude, are you okay, dude?
1645980	1646980	Yeah.
1646980	1647980	My dad's here.
1647980	1651980	You seem really unaffected by the fact that we just broke your dad out of jail
1651980	1654980	and like almost got in jail ourselves.
1654980	1657980	Julius is kind of like, what are you talking about?
1658980	1660980	Whatever, Beck.
1660980	1661980	We got my dad's ear.
1661980	1663980	Going to get tacos.
1663980	1665980	I give a worried glance to Cal.
1665980	1668980	Hey, Mr. Summers.
1668980	1669980	Yeah.
1669980	1673980	Can we have a talk about your parenting style?
1673980	1676980	What can you learn?
1676980	1681980	I was very confident.
1681980	1684980	What's going on here between you and your boy?
1684980	1690980	I've raised Julius to take care of the actual world,
1690980	1693980	the underlying reality that exists,
1693980	1698980	that we hide away from those who would otherwise be affected.
1698980	1699980	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1699980	1700980	We know all about that.
1700980	1702980	I live in the shadows.
1702980	1705980	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
1705980	1708980	Dad, I forgot to tell you, you're going to be stoked.
1708980	1709980	Typh?
1709980	1711980	No.
1711980	1712980	Really?
1712980	1713980	Yeah.
1713980	1714980	What happened?
1714980	1715980	I killed him.
1715980	1716980	Wait, you killed him?
1716980	1717980	I killed him.
1717980	1718980	That's what he tells us.
1718980	1721980	I thought we were compartmentalizing that.
1724980	1726980	This is what I want to talk about.
1726980	1729980	You have a strange effect on this boy,
1729980	1731980	and I don't think it's entirely natural.
1731980	1734980	Speaking of the dark weirdness of the world or whatnot.
1734980	1738980	Something about hearing Cal and his tone of voice
1738980	1742980	kind of snaps Julius back a little bit.
1742980	1744980	As he's driving, he starts to just sweat.
1744980	1745980	There.
1745980	1746980	See?
1746980	1747980	Julius.
1747980	1750980	Julius, are you in there, boy?
1750980	1753980	And he's like shaking, and he has to pull the van over.
1753980	1755980	What are you doing?
1755980	1756980	His heart is like racing.
1756980	1757980	He needs a medic.
1757980	1758980	Can you tell?
1758980	1759980	We have to keep going.
1759980	1760980	What the fuck?
1760980	1763980	We did not go in there to do that.
1763980	1767980	No, I mean, I didn't know that you were even coming today.
1767980	1769980	I didn't know that this was happening either.
1769980	1770980	Oh my fucking God.
1770980	1771980	We have to destroy that tape.
1771980	1772980	Why were you filming?
1772980	1773980	We do have to destroy that tape.
1773980	1776980	Guys, what if it's the thing that proves we were right all along?
1776980	1778980	In what way?
1778980	1779980	I don't know.
1779980	1780980	The numbers are a thing.
1780980	1785980	Hold on.
1785980	1789980	Julius starts driving again, maybe towards tacos,
1789980	1791980	probably just aimlessly.
1791980	1793980	I think we got to tell him.
1793980	1797980	Like, we got to fill him in.
1797980	1798980	And then they fill him in.
1799980	1804980	Isn't that fucking crazy?
1804980	1806980	I mean, are you guys cool with that?
1806980	1809980	We're filling Burl in on all of our escapades.
1809980	1810980	Yeah.
1810980	1814980	Beck is fine with it because he is using that as part of the argument to not destroy the footage.
1814980	1815980	It's all linked.
1815980	1816980	See?
1816980	1819980	At the end of the day, we're going to have this body of evidence.
1819980	1820980	It's going to be irrefutable.
1820980	1821980	Bodies.
1821980	1824980	Yeah, there's been a lot of bodies.
1824980	1826980	Is it for the greater good?
1826980	1827980	Is it?
1827980	1830980	This might be one of those things where the ends justify the means?
1830980	1831980	Oh, yeah.
1831980	1832980	Definitely.
1832980	1833980	Obviously.
1833980	1836980	I mean, think about what we're doing.
1836980	1837980	What are we doing?
1837980	1838980	What are you doing?
1838980	1843980	We're learning about the world and how it works and we work in the shadows.
1843980	1848980	And we keep the world safe from that which they cannot know.
1848980	1853980	You know, I kicked the ass of a creep a lot like you just a few hours ago.
1853980	1855980	Julius is so offended.
1856980	1858980	Don't talk to daddy like that.
1858980	1859980	I knew it.
1859980	1860980	I knew there was some weird thing.
1860980	1863980	You went to him so quickly with his whole daddy bed.
1863980	1865980	I was just looking for somebody.
1865980	1867980	And now I've got two.
1867980	1869980	I have to be everybody's fucking dad?
1871980	1872980	No.
1872980	1873980	You don't.
1873980	1874980	He has a dad.
1874980	1875980	But look at you.
1875980	1876980	Come on, look at me.
1876980	1877980	Look at you.
1877980	1878980	You're three weird strands.
1878980	1879980	We just broke you out of jail.
1879980	1881980	You hypnotized your son into breaking you out of jail.
1881980	1882980	I mean, he-
1882980	1884980	Who would call that good parenting?
1884980	1885980	Hmm?
1885980	1887980	I'd call it good sunning for sure.
1887980	1888980	Thanks.
1888980	1889980	Good job, son.
1889980	1892980	Dad, maybe tell him about the rat guy.
1894980	1895980	Tell me about the rat guy.
1895980	1897980	You want to know about Matthew?
1905980	1907980	Oh my God.
1907980	1909980	Beck, are you filming?
1911980	1912980	Keep driving, Julius.
1912980	1913980	Yes, sir.
1913980	1914980	Toward tacos.
1914980	1918980	Julius types in, best tacos near me.
1918980	1923980	And he spends a little too much time actually reading the reviews of every place.
1923980	1924980	I want birria tacos.
1924980	1925980	Oh, okay.
1925980	1929980	Julius finds one with birria tacos and heads there.
1929980	1933980	And the place is called Beer E A Taco.
1933980	1935980	Like beer and one taco?
1935980	1939980	Beer and a taco in English and Spanish.
1939980	1941980	Beer E A Taco.
1942980	1946980	While we're heading to Beer E A Taco, Mr. Summers.
1946980	1947980	Yeah.
1947980	1949980	Why don't you tell me about Matthew?
1949980	1952980	Matthew was kind.
1952980	1954980	He was good.
1954980	1964980	He was, well, I assume Julius already explained his physical abnormalities, but Matthew could feel.
1964980	1966980	Matthew could kind of talk.
1966980	1977980	He could communicate after a while in his own way through, you know, bits of squeaks, but seemingly had a human vocal cord set on him.
1977980	1987980	So the squeaks were varied enough to where, you know, I could make out kind of the situation and we would talk for hours.
1988980	1990980	They fucking took him.
1993980	1994980	The firm?
1994980	1995980	The firm.
1995980	1996980	The seventh.
1997980	1999980	Whatever you want to call them.
1999980	2000980	The government.
2000980	2002980	The United States of America.
2002980	2006980	Dad, we found a place where there's a lot of Matthews.
2006980	2007980	Hey, what do you mean?
2007980	2010980	The whole Godel thing we were talking about?
2010980	2012980	How it's big and it's bad?
2012980	2014980	There are animal people there, sure.
2014980	2015980	I don't know if they're Matthews.
2015980	2017980	Yeah, it seems like maybe some of these could talk.
2017980	2019980	Like really just talk talk.
2019980	2025980	We had discussed these being separate, whole separate deals and perhaps leading an army of the rat men to defeat these other animal people.
2025980	2028980	You never saw another rat man like Matthew?
2028980	2038980	No, I wish I wish I could have. I wish I would have made friends with the whole army, but no, just Matthew.
2039980	2040980	Oh.
2042980	2043980	I hope he's okay.
2043980	2046980	Did you ever find out like where he came from?
2047980	2066980	He used to draw this, you know, I tried different ways of communicating with him and anytime that he could get his hands on something to, you know, make a design with or draw something out, it was the same design over and over and he grabs a notebook and starts sketching and
2066980	2070980	Beck is rewinding through his footage to get to the it pit.
2070980	2085980	And he holds up a sketch right as you arrive at the footage of the it pit and there is a singular difference actually between the design that he is sketched.
2085980	2089980	It does not have an upside down cross.
2090980	2092980	All the other symbols are present.
2092980	2094980	It didn't have an upside down cross.
2094980	2097980	I see the upside down church when I smell God.
2097980	2103980	We were in Godel Gorge and this was scrawled on the walls of a really fucking terrible place, dude.
2103980	2105980	Oh, we've been in the it pit, baby.
2105980	2107980	I think it's where they kept the animal people.
2107980	2109980	Yeah, and that's what he's, yeah.
2110980	2112980	How long have they been doing this?
2112980	2113980	Oh my God.
2113980	2114980	Since before you were alive.
2114980	2116980	I think we gotta go back.
2117980	2119980	Dad, they have like jumpy, bouncy sidewalks?
2119980	2129980	I mean, we know for sure now Matthew has some connection to Godel's Gorge.
2129980	2130980	It would appear that way.
2130980	2138980	And Kaylee got her yeast that makes her want to eat people or they go in her stomach or something and that's from Godel.
2138980	2140980	It made her go crazy.
2140980	2143980	The same happened to Dr. Brock apparently.
2143980	2145980	Who knows who else?
2145980	2151980	And every time I've smelled that yeast, yeasts, I see the upside down church.
2151980	2155980	Yeast, you've smelled what's in the bag, but we think they put what's in the bag in the yeasts.
2155980	2162980	Well, either way, it's the same trigger and it makes me see the upside down church with blood and bodies and I smell God.
2162980	2167980	I see like visions of like things happened and things that are happening.
2167980	2169980	I haven't seen the church myself yet.
2169980	2170980	And Fred's not dead?
2170980	2172980	Oh yeah, what's that about?
2172980	2174980	Why does he want to pretend that he's dead?
2174980	2180980	Maybe to, uh, hell, I don't know. I just cover the news.
2180980	2184980	I don't want to make sense of it.
2184980	2188980	That's for the historians.
2188980	2193980	Julius turns off his maps and is going to start driving towards the bridge.
2193980	2200980	Uh, Julius, seems you turned away from beer-y-ah tacos.
2200980	2203980	Yeah. Um, are we not going to the taco?
2203980	2206980	I think we gotta go. I think, I think we gotta go.
2206980	2207980	To?
2207980	2208980	To the hole.
2208980	2222980	Oh, no, I'd rather not. I've got to meet, uh, a mysterious caller at a jazz den tonight.
2222980	2226980	Julius is just going to kind of blankly stare ahead and keep driving.
2226980	2230980	Are you, you're thinking about jumping into the hole? Is that what your plan is here?
2230980	2231980	I don't know, maybe.
2231980	2233980	Uh, Burl, can you speak to your boy here?
2233980	2240980	Well, I mean, if he wants to go down the hole, we're going to need, what, some sort of scuba gear?
2240980	2243980	And like backup, like a lot of backup.
2243980	2246980	We've talked about this. It's, it's really dumb to go there right now.
2246980	2254980	We should bring, if not an army of rat men, I don't know, some, uh,
2254980	2257980	do you have any mean friends?
2257980	2263980	Julius immediately starts thinking of all the people he's met through Delta Green.
2263980	2265980	Oh, do you remember any numbers?
2265980	2266980	Uh, yeah.
2266980	2269980	Three, six.
2269980	2271980	Do you remember anyone's numbers?
2271980	2272980	Yeah.
2272980	2274980	He starts heading back to Buri, uh, taco.
2274980	2277980	Should we like rally your guys' troops?
2277980	2282980	Oh, this could be fun. Get the old crew back together. Well, not the last old crew, but-
2282980	2284980	No, they got caught. No offense.
2284980	2286980	Oh, maybe the bog job? Bog job crew?
2286980	2288980	Yeah, bog job crew.
2288980	2289980	Yeah.
2289980	2291980	Should we tell Diggory?
2291980	2294980	No, I think we should absolutely not tell Diggory.
2294980	2298980	Okay. Maybe we should bring that doctor with us.
2298980	2300980	And he looks at Cal and Beck.
2300980	2301980	Are you kidnapping us?
2301980	2302980	No, we're-
2302980	2309980	I mean, I'm not fucking going either. We're going to hang back, I think, and they're going to go down the hole with the crew.
2309980	2311980	Wait, Stevie, you don't- I mean like-
2311980	2313980	No, I'm not fucking going down there. Are you kidding me?
2313980	2319980	I don't exactly want to either, but like, we've been working on this for a while now. We need to see it through to the end, don't you?
2319980	2325980	You saw what that was down there. I'm with Cal. We're not going down there unless we have an army of Ant-Man coming in behind us.
2325980	2326980	This doesn't- yeah.
2326980	2331980	Right. I'm not saying we go now. I'm saying we call up our guys. We go get some tacos.
2331980	2334980	But who needs the bog job guys when you've got the US Marines?
2334980	2335980	I don't know if-
2335980	2339980	I mean, the bog job guys are kind of more up for this sort of challenge.
2339980	2341980	And the Marines might-
2341980	2344980	What's the world sees what's going on there in our news story?
2344980	2347980	Do you think the Godels and the Marines don't work together?
2347980	2349980	The boys got a point.
2350980	2352980	The Navy then.
2365980	2367980	And it's all mine
2374980	2379980	Cause my life is great
2379980	2394980	So out of character, in my head, I was like, oh shit, if Julius and his dad want to go down with a couple of dudes from the bog job, you guys could create characters that are the bog job crew.
2394980	2399980	That would be fun. And then we could send that crew in together into the hole.
2399980	2400980	Yeah. I like that.
2400980	2401980	That would be cool.
2401980	2402980	That sounds fun.
2402980	2403980	Totally.
2403980	2404980	And then Cal and Beck don't die.
2404980	2405980	Exactly.
2406980	2410980	We could just strap GoPros to our heads. That way it's documented.
2410980	2413980	Perfect. That's what I'm talking about right there.
2413980	2417980	And Burl Summers is now going to be my Pat Jack Nicholson impression.
2417980	2421980	She went, Jack, it's a good choice for your whole creepy, weird, evil vibe.
2421980	2423980	Yeah. I was just going higher.
2423980	2425980	It's more sinister that way.
2425980	2426980	Yeah.
2427980	2440980	Well, maybe, uh, I mean, if you guys, you know, I, I understand you don't want to come like my dad and I we've been fighting this shit for years, but I mean, you can talk your way out of stuff, but I don't know about in Godel's Gorge really.
2440980	2443980	What if you just flew a drone down with us?
2445980	2448980	No, no, no.
2449980	2451980	No, Cal, let's think about that.
2451980	2453980	Let's not think about that.
2453980	2457980	We would get the footage we need and no harm would be coming our way.
2457980	2461980	No harm? No harm? From those robot freaks? No harm?
2463980	2465980	I would be in complete control, Cal.
2465980	2467980	I don't trust drones.
2467980	2468980	Why?
2471980	2472980	It's not...
2472980	2473980	Okay, I'm sorry.
2473980	2474980	I pull Stevia's eye.
2474980	2475980	Cal, yeah.
2475980	2476980	They scare him.
2476980	2477980	Yeah, clearly.
2477980	2482980	No, Cal, I would be in total control of it. There wouldn't even be any kind of AI sentience on board.
2482980	2484980	What about a flying camera instead?
2484980	2495980	We got the job done just well enough in my day without flying cameras or, or, or the G-spot or, or any of this newfangled nonsense.
2500980	2502980	The news was serviceable and accurate.
2503980	2507980	Julius looks at it back and just kind of shrugs and winks like, yeah, sure, we won't.
2507980	2508980	Yeah, we just won't.
2508980	2511980	You can watch, you can watch our GoPro head, head footage.
2511980	2513980	Perfect. Okay, just the GoPros.
2514980	2517980	I think I've got some of their numbers still and Julius starts going through his phone.
2517980	2524980	He searches bog and it's like, it's like J-bog, Q-bog.
2526980	2528980	All right, who's J and who's Q?
2529980	2530980	My name's Joe.
2531980	2532980	Perfect.
2532980	2534980	That won't be confusing at all.
2535980	2538980	I mean, it'd be less confusing if, like, if I was Joe.
2555980	2558980	Oh shit, what the fuck? Is this thing on?
2558980	2567980	Ah, hey, it's Wolf and I'm here with a brand new track that'll make you smack your dad for not introducing it to you sooner.
2567980	2570980	It's Time Walk with War.
2588980	2604980	Destroy
2604980	2611980	Vacuus
2611980	2615980	Conquer
2615980	2622980	War
2622980	2628980	Welcome, everyone, to somewhere in the middle of episode 36 of season two of Pretending to be People.
2628980	2636980	And we are blessed, we are honored, we are humbled and fucking stoked to have a guest joining us this evening.
2636980	2639980	You may know her from season three of the Glass Cannon Network's Get in the Trunk.
2639980	2647980	You may know her from Time for Chaos, the GCN's playthrough of Massenar Lethetepe, or their live shows, or their upcoming show Gatewalkers.
2647980	2651980	You may know her as the queen of new game whodis.
2651980	2654980	It's Kate Stamets!
2659980	2661980	I forgot I did all those things. I was like, season three of what?
2664980	2667980	How was that? How was playing Delta Green with, uh, with Glass Cannon?
2667980	2672980	That was fun. I think that was the one season that Grant ran, so, like, it was just fun.
2672980	2678980	I like, like, usually Troy's the one who, like, runs us through things, so it's always fun having someone else run me through something.
2678980	2686980	Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Any time I can convince one of these other folks to take the, take the reins, uh, I enjoy it thoroughly.
2686980	2692980	He really likes, um, getting to inflict revenge as a player for all the plans of his we've messed up.
2692980	2693980	Sounds right.
2693980	2697980	I'm running a game on Tuesday, and I think you're gonna die, probably.
2697980	2698980	Oh, hell yeah.
2698980	2704980	It's best to just sideline his character as quickly as possible to make things, make things go a lot smoothly.
2704980	2710980	Well, Kate, for those of our listeners who aren't familiar with all that rad shit that you've been up to, how'd you, uh-
2710980	2712980	Did you say rat shit or rad shit?
2712980	2713980	All that rat-
2713980	2714980	Same thing.
2714980	2716980	Rat shit that you've been up to?
2716980	2725980	How'd you, how'd you dive into, uh, role-playing? What got you started in this hobby?
2725980	2729980	Well, so, like, my husband and I, like, we had, like, this itch we needed to scratch.
2729980	2731980	That sounds weird when I say my husband.
2731980	2733980	It sounds like the start of a great delta gaming scenario.
2733980	2735980	It's hard to play games like this when you're older.
2735980	2742980	Like, it's hard to find a group to play with, someone to run you through it, so we played with, like, um, at, like, a local shop near us in Brooklyn.
2742980	2750980	It's like you paid, I don't remember how much it was, and someone there runs you and other people that are local through, like, an encounter. It was D&D 5E.
2750980	2758980	For those of you who can't see Kate, she seems to be in her 70s or 80s, so it's hard to find, you know, people your age to, to play with. That's not true.
2758980	2760980	You just said you were older, and I was like, wait, what?
2760980	2768980	No, no, I mean, like, it's hard to find, like, other people who are gonna make the same amount of commitment, like, they want, like, I wanna play all the time, and-
2768980	2769980	Yes.
2769980	2782980	Like, finding someone who wants to GM, it's, like, hard, so we did that, and that helped for a minute, but we were playing with strangers, and then I kinda accidentally started playing with Glass Cannon, so, like, I'm, I'm good now, my itch is scratched.
2782980	2783980	Hell yeah.
2783980	2784980	Just like saying.
2784980	2785980	Trying to find a way out of it.
2785980	2787980	You're like, how do I get on this fucking train?
2787980	2790980	I think we're gonna get real itchy tonight.
2790980	2791980	Real itchy tonight?
2791980	2792980	Yeah.
2792980	2793980	Yeah, well-
2793980	2794980	In the bog.
2794980	2822980	There's a lot to get through, I realized, as I was, uh, writing for this arc, because it starts on Tuesday, April 18th, 2017, and the text at the bottom of the screen in your mind types out the date as we set our scene here in the past, over five years before this absurd jailbreak that just took place in the present day of Thursday, July 7th, 2022.
2822980	2834980	But, back here in the spring of 2017, we see a team of six making their way through soppingly saturated soil in thick, dense woods.
2834980	2839980	Now, let's get a brief rundown of who's who on this job before we dive in.
2839980	2843980	First off, we already know Burl and Julius Summers are here.
2843980	2845980	Burl looks almost the exact same.
2845980	2854980	He's a sinewy, middle-aged dude with long, black, stringy hair and three long whiskers on his chin.
2854980	2858980	Luke, what's Julius' vibe five years ago, 2017? Any different? Same?
2858980	2863980	He, uh, would be, let's see, math is so hard.
2863980	2864980	Nuts.
2864980	2865980	24 years old.
2865980	2866980	That's 29 minus 5.
2866980	2873980	That is. I mean, he's basically the same Julius, just younger, huge thighs, just hanging out with his dad.
2873980	2878980	Hanging out with his dad. So, huge thighs. What are you wearing in this boggy sort of environment?
2878980	2882980	I assume everyone has, like, big rubber boots on to kind of trudge their way through this situation.
2882980	2899980	He's looking very Duck Dynasty. He's got, like, a camo thermal sweater on, camo cargo pants, big rubber duck boots, and, uh, yeah.
2899980	2900980	Rat.
2900980	2901980	Rat.
2901980	2914980	And, uh, then we see, leading the group, there's a local guide with this team, kind of taking the front of the pack, making their way through this boggy terrain.
2914980	2919980	And that is going to be Mr. Judt Harry.
2919980	2926980	Yeah, that's me. That's, uh, that's Norman Sumter. People who know him call him Stump.
2927980	2935980	Uh, he's got this, he's got long, long, long gray hair that he keeps in a real nice tight ponytail that runs down his back.
2935980	2941980	And he's got equally gray and straight and thin and long gray beard down the front.
2941980	2947980	He's wearing, uh, these aviator glasses that he can flip up, have shades as a flip up there.
2947980	2956980	And, uh, his teeth are kind of bad and he's kind of, he's kind of thin and scraggly all over, but he's also a little bit like live on his feet.
2956980	2963980	And he looks like there's kind of a, an intensity to him. And, uh, yeah, he's kind of leading this group right now.
2963980	2968980	And he's, uh, he, he, it looks like he is Legolas-ing his way through these woods.
2968980	2974980	He's seeing things that you guys aren't seeing and he's pointing at things and he's doing maneuvers with his hands that you guys kind of understand.
2975980	2977980	And he's not saying a goddamn word to Frodo.
2979980	2981980	What kind of music does he like?
2981980	2982980	Good question.
2983980	2987980	Oh, he's, uh, CCR for sure. REO Speedwagon.
2987980	2990980	Just touring the county fairs of America.
2990980	2991980	Uh-huh. Styx.
2992980	2994980	Hell yeah, dude. Come sail away.
2994980	3000980	Midway through the group, we've got a, uh, a young woman compared to Stump.
3000980	3003980	Caitlin Stamets. Who, who do we see here?
3003980	3012980	You see a 35 year old, like light blonde sugar, sort of length hair, brown eyes. Her name's Phoebe, Phoebe Richards.
3012980	3019980	She's a millennial in tech, but then she also has like a woo woo side, which I think is what the kids are calling that these days.
3019980	3028980	Um, so like she's really smart and gifted. She's a computer scientist, but she also like, you know, always has a clear quartz in her bra.
3028980	3037980	Um, she, she wears sock martens. She's like mildly alt. She might have an iced coffee as she like rolls up to you and she's like swishing it.
3042980	3049980	And then, uh, another, is it an old man, Thomas? Are you playing an old man? Just a middle aged man? When I, when I read your character.
3049980	3050980	There's an age.
3050980	3054980	There's an age. Well, I'm going to stop talking about your character. Just tell me about him.
3054980	3060980	There's a young man at this point, five years younger than when you'll see him later. Uh, he's about 25 at this point.
3060980	3067980	Um, I don't think anybody would call him a stud, uh, unless they confused him for like a, a plank of wood.
3067980	3079980	He is, he's live, but real bony, just in all the wrong ways. He's covered in more grit and dirt than it seems like he could have accrued in the time they've been out here.
3079980	3090980	So it must've been on him from the start. He's wearing like tan overalls and a t-shirt that was probably white at one point, but it's just covered in mysterious, like black powders and things.
3090980	3100980	And you can't really see his face because he's just got this mass of messy, like thick hair and these giant Coke bottle glasses that are kind of peeking out through it.
3100980	3103980	He looks like a weird straw robot almost.
3103980	3107980	Amazing. Oh, I love that. And what was his name?
3107980	3111980	Mo Gibson. Mo Gibson. Mo Gibson.
3111980	3119980	The sixth person you see in this crew, right? One, two, three, four, five, six. Yeah, the sixth person is Agent Lee.
3119980	3139980	Agent Lee is a fresh faced gentleman from Langley and he is, unfortunately for him, wearing his like suit and dress shoes in this bog, tied, tied tight all the way up to the top, top button, buttoned.
3139980	3147980	And he is just constantly complaining about his dress shoes getting wet.
3147980	3160980	And he's talking about how he's going to have blisters later, but this team, your team is trudging through the isolated wetlands that are the Southern Appalachian mountain bogs of North Carolina.
3160980	3176980	You were sent here under the guise of official government business to find out why construction has been repeatedly halted on a refined oil pipeline being installed through this almost entirely uninhabited landscape, uninhabited landscape.
3176980	3194980	And when you finally made it to the job site with the necessary help of your local guide, Stump, you found it abandoned. Mobile trailers, big yellow machines for excavation, stacks and stacks of pipe segments all sat silently undisturbed, stagnant.
3194980	3202980	And after exploring the base of operations further, no paperwork has been touched nor checklists marked off in three days.
3202980	3207980	And that's when you heard the voice of your local guide holler out that he'd found something strange.
3207980	3211980	Found something strange!
3211980	3220980	Didn't even put anything in my little notes here. I was hoping that would happen.
3220980	3224980	Look at how weird this is folks. Come here.
3224980	3232980	And the weird thing that Norman Sumter, aka Stump, is kind of like poking at, maybe like even lifting it out like of the mud with a multi-tool.
3232980	3239980	He's found a thick braided rope covered in the mud of the bog like it had been buried.
3239980	3250980	And a couple crews worth of footsteps on either side leading away, lead away from the job site, deeper into the wooded and wet bog lands.
3250980	3256980	And giving this rope a solid tug, it was clearly anchored at the unknown end.
3256980	3265980	And after some back and forth, your group decided that a single agent would follow the dirty rope as the rest of the squad, still led by Stump,
3265980	3272980	would follow within sight and off to the side a bit as to not all walk the same path as the missing crewman.
3272980	3273980	It's a rope!
3273980	3276980	Wait, follow the dirty rope into the bog?
3276980	3277980	That's right.
3277980	3278980	Oh wow.
3278980	3285980	And your guys' team drew straws. Basically what we're doing here, you guys are going to play your characters in a second,
3285980	3295980	but we're doing a flashback and so I'm doing a lot of like explaining what happened leading up to where we're going to kick off and then we'll dive in.
3295980	3297980	Oh no man, I'm all about the rope talk.
3297980	3300980	Yeah. Can you describe it even more?
3300980	3307980	Now this here is natural. A lot of people think that rope does just pop up and ball from time to time. This is not natural. This is an unknown rope.
3307980	3311980	It's strangely fibrous. Does anyone have biology?
3311980	3319980	How could a rope be strangely fibrous? They're so fibrous.
3319980	3327980	It's strangely fibrous if anyone is adept with, if anyone has a knowledge of rope.
3327980	3329980	I actually have that written down here.
3329980	3330980	Or any sort of biology.
3330980	3335980	I gave myself craft improvised contraptions. Does this appear to be an improvised contraption?
3335980	3338980	Hey, I'll answer that since you took it. It does not.
3338980	3339980	Perfect.
3339980	3346980	This entire group is making their way through kind of watching as Agent Lee drew the short straw.
3346980	3353980	And he's the one who has to follow the rope through the bog as the rest of you are kind of behind off to the side following through.
3353980	3359980	And it wasn't long before the job site behind you was completely obscured by the landscape.
3359980	3367980	And it wasn't much longer until the path ahead of you all opened up and you found the missing construction workers.
3367980	3371980	There must have been at least 40 of them.
3371980	3372980	There must be at least 40 of them.
3372980	3374980	Half buried upside down.
3374980	3376980	Was 40 of them.
3376980	3379980	In the soppingly saturated soil.
3379980	3381980	Hey, Stump, is this normal?
3381980	3383980	Strangely, in rows.
3383980	3386980	Mud covered rubber boots pointing to heaven.
3386980	3387980	Jeans below.
3387980	3390980	Highlighter work vests just visible.
3390980	3395980	The majority of their torsos fully down in the muck.
3395980	3401980	Their arms and heads making up the root systems of these human beings planted like crops in a field.
3401980	3403980	Silent.
3403980	3404980	Undisturbed.
3404980	3406980	Stagnant.
3406980	3410980	And you smell something other than the dampened decay of the bog.
3410980	3413980	Unsettling due to its lack of congruency with its setting.
3413980	3416980	It's a delicate floral fragrance.
3416980	3419980	And that's when Agent Lee screams.
3419980	3423980	The rope in his hands is now emanating a bioluminescent glow.
3423980	3427980	And he succeeds his role.
3427980	3431980	So he is struggling as he's trying to keep this radiant potential gar-
3431980	3432980	Garret?
3432980	3433980	Garot?
3433980	3434980	Garote?
3434980	3435980	Garot?
3435980	3439980	The rope that goes around your neck a noose of some sort from looping itself around his neck.
3439980	3446980	And now we're going to jump in, in turn-based action, starting with whoever has the highest dexterity.
3446980	3449980	Call him out! Who's got dexterity?
3449980	3450980	I have 70.
3450980	3451980	I have 60.
3451980	3452980	60.
3452980	3453980	Uh, 65.
3453980	3455980	65. Stunt.
3455980	3456980	55.
3456980	3458980	55.
3458980	3465980	Julius Summers, you are kicking things off. Remind us what you look like and how you react to this situation.
3465980	3476980	Julius is, yeah, wearing full camo, got the rubber boots on, and he- this is pretty- this isn't, like, one of the worst things he's ever seen.
3476980	3486980	But, uh, it's still not great, so he's gonna go and, like, just pick up one of the boots and just, like, see if there's anything in it.
3486980	3489980	There's a foot in it. Who had 65 dexterity?
3489980	3490980	Me.
3490980	3491980	You're up.
3492980	3497980	Mo Mo vomits all over the swamp.
3497980	3500980	Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. That's gross.
3500980	3501980	Yeah.
3501980	3504980	It's nasty. There was a foot in that boot. Who had- who had 60 dex?
3504980	3506980	There's a foot in my boot.
3506980	3509980	So the rope is attacking Agent Lee.
3509980	3524980	Who's about, maybe, 20 feet away from you, and you've opened up yourselves, like, you've walked out into this sort of open, boggy field, uh, that this rope is coming out of, and this is the field in which all these humans are planted upside down, boots to heaven.
3524980	3527980	How do we feel about Agent Lee? Do we like him?
3527980	3528980	Do I care?
3528980	3532980	He didn't have the sense to not dress like a man in black in the fucking bog.
3532980	3533980	Seems uptight.
3533980	3540980	So, like, I guess what she would be wondering is, is this rope coming out the ground, like, where we are?
3540980	3551980	Yeah, so, as you, uh, you can roll, um, a search, um, in order to see if, uh, if you can make out where it's, where it's coming from.
3551980	3553980	Yeah, get those dice, we're gonna roll them!
3553980	3559980	Okay, search, okay, not that bad. Uh, okay, D100s. Got it, got it, okay.
3560980	3562980	Oh, that's a 9 under 40!
3562980	3564980	Yay! Starting off good.
3565980	3572980	Phoebe, you see this rope, and you see, you notice that the bioluminescence is, uh, is, is kind of, like, uh, following it,
3572980	3578980	and, and the rope that's tying itself around his neck is kind of heading into the middle of where all these people are buried,
3578980	3587980	and you see a slight glow kind of underneath the muck and the bog, and you can make out exactly where it's emanating from,
3587980	3591980	and it's only about ten feet in front of you.
3591980	3595980	I wish I had, like, a knife on me, because then I'd just try to chop the rope.
3595980	3597980	Whoa, what's that in your back pocket?
3597980	3598980	I feel like I'd have one.
3598980	3600980	Why wouldn't you? It'd be nuts!
3600980	3603980	I'd definitely have a sharp crystal in my bra, at least.
3603980	3611980	Um, I want to try to, I feel like the, by default move, I'd want to go up and try to chop the rope, yeah.
3611980	3613980	Go ahead and roll a melee weapons attack.
3613980	3620980	Oh, no. Well, that's not the worst, either. But that's a bad roll. That's a 96 over 30.
3620980	3622980	That's a critical failure.
3622980	3623980	So, here's the thing-
3623980	3625980	My iced coffee's still in my hand.
3625980	3631980	Here's the thing, Kate. Um, we're children, and-
3631980	3633980	No, we're very, very clever men.
3633980	3639980	And so, 69 is the most critical success you can roll, and therefore-
3639980	3641980	No, no, no, no, no, it's a 96. It was a 96.
3641980	3643980	I know, therefore-
3643980	3644980	But therefore-
3644980	3645980	Oh, no!
3645980	3646980	Yeah.
3646980	3649980	No, no, I think that's what, uh, Glass Cannon does, also.
3649980	3651980	Oh, no, it's 86 is the worst one, not 96.
3651980	3652980	Oh, that's funny.
3652980	3653980	That's funny.
3653980	3654980	I think.
3654980	3655980	I like that.
3655980	3656980	Yeah.
3656980	3657980	Kitchen humor.
3657980	3658980	We were just like, the opposite.
3658980	3659980	Yeah.
3659980	3664980	We're like, not doing that.
3664980	3665980	The worst.
3665980	3675980	Alright, so, as you drop your iced coffee directly into the bog, a significant amount of bog water starts combining itself
3675980	3684980	inside the open top of your iced coffee, and there is very little chance that you're gonna want to drink any of that.
3684980	3685980	That is-
3685980	3688980	That is the worst thing that could ever happen to me. Thank you for-
3688980	3691980	I mean, don't- Wow, that was the worst.
3691980	3692980	And as you trip forward-
3692980	3696980	That's one of the most upsetting things I've heard described in our horror podcast.
3696980	3697980	That was $7!
3697980	3701980	Yeah, like, I had such a visceral reaction to that being ruined.
3701980	3704980	I'm gonna be tired later.
3704980	3712980	As you try to dive forward with your knife, the knife slips out of your hand and disappears into the bog.
3712980	3722980	You are on your hands and knees, about six inches deep in this thing, and kind of facing exactly where this bioluminescence is,
3722980	3728980	and you might be the only one who can see that it is heading directly for you.
3728980	3731980	Ooh, I yell, guys, look!
3731980	3732980	Guys, look!
3732980	3737980	Burl Summers is up next, and he heeds your advice, but he rolls a fail as well,
3737980	3743980	and he jumps down with a machete in his hand and just kind of slaps it into the water,
3743980	3746980	hacking at absolutely nothing in his attempt.
3746980	3752980	His three whiskers coming off of his chin, blowing in the wind, and after him goes,
3752980	3754980	Stumpy, Mr. Stumpman.
3754980	3755980	Save us, Stump!
3755980	3759980	Stump is pulling a heftier looking knife off of his belt.
3759980	3764980	It was sheathed. He had it hanging on a sheath on the edge of his belt, and he pulls that out,
3764980	3770980	and he wants to lunge, but he's gonna lunge for kind of that center point that it was heading towards.
3770980	3774980	He wants to just dive and slam it down into there.
3774980	3776980	He's trying to cause damage more than he's trying to cut.
3776980	3780980	Okay, awesome. Go ahead and roll melee.
3780980	3786980	Because Phoebe called out where it is, you don't have to take a negative, and his fingers are raised.
3786980	3787980	What is happening?
3787980	3790980	What do those raised fingers look like?
3790980	3791980	The Twin Towers.
3791980	3794980	An 11. That's a critical success.
3794980	3795980	Take it all from the top.
3795980	3797980	It was an 11! Whoa!
3797980	3799980	That's a critical success!
3801980	3807980	Oh shit, dude. Okay, as you dive in, your body dumps down.
3807980	3809980	Basically, you've been standing on this bog, right?
3809980	3815980	It's not that deep. Your feet only go so far into it, especially you floating atop of it like you have been.
3815980	3826980	But as you dump, as you dump, as you stump in to the water, horizontally, knife out, just stabbing down,
3826980	3836980	you plant it directly into something, and your body is actually completely underground as well.
3836980	3837980	Underground meaning under the water.
3837980	3844980	And as everyone sees your body kind of dip under the water, it's that idea of like,
3844980	3847980	holy shit, there is a deeper part of the bog right there.
3847980	3857980	And then suddenly, from out of the water, rising weightless is this figure, humanoid in tattered clothes,
3857980	3866980	and you see that her hair was the rope that is heading off and still trying to take down Agent Lee.
3866980	3871980	And your knife is buried directly in the top of her head.
3871980	3881980	And she is singing, crying, laughing, all at the same time, and I need everyone to roll con to avoid.
3881980	3884980	18, I pass.
3884980	3889980	18 as well, I also pass.
3889980	3890980	What?
3890980	3891980	Hell yeah.
3891980	3892980	Oh, it's real.
3892980	3893980	Just under 68.
3893980	3894980	Nice.
3894980	3895980	Under 70.
3895980	3898980	Well done. Okay, and stump, how'd you do?
3898980	3904980	Stump's highest score is his constitution, and it's a 75, and he rolled an 89.
3904980	3905980	That's not good.
3905980	3910980	But it kind of makes sense, because he just kind of rodeoed this thing in the head and is hanging on.
3910980	3921980	So the rest of you kind of see this, and Joe, Stump has his knife buried into the top of this creature's head,
3921980	3927980	and it is laughing or crying or singing directly in your face,
3927980	3934980	and the mud and muck across its face is slowly just starting to fall away,
3934980	3944980	and you see the skin underneath is so thin and withered away that the bones are almost creaking through and out.
3944980	3950980	It's been in the water for so long that it's disintegrating into nothingness,
3950980	3960980	and as you hear this noise in your head, these memories are unlocked, and we go immediately back to Stump back in the war.
3960980	3962980	Please describe the worst thing you've ever done.
3962980	3966980	Oh, Jesus Christ.
3966980	3967980	Joe Terry.
3967980	3975980	Stump was a sniper spotter in the war, and he got his nickname Stump because he would sit there for sometimes hours,
3975980	3983980	stock still, just trying to line up a shot, and he'd been there for a while, and his sniper guy was getting restless.
3983980	3987980	He was like, come on, Stump, you don't have to live up to your name all the time.
3987980	3993980	And finally, it got to Stump, and he said, all right, firing line is six degrees north by northwest,
3993980	3999980	line up the shot, give it a wind speed of 35, and go.
3999980	4002980	And Stump knew that wasn't the right call.
4002980	4007980	He wanted to wait a little bit longer, but he felt pressured, and yeah, it hit civilians.
4007980	4012980	This bullet ripped through a bunch of people who were standing next to the thing he wanted to hit.
4012980	4021980	And as soon as you are replaying that in your mind, you see this entity, this creature that you're face to face with now,
4021980	4027980	has supplanted itself inside of your memory, and it's watching you do this,
4027980	4037980	and you are feeling its history of its land just being overtaken repeatedly, and repeatedly, and moved,
4037980	4044980	and shuffled off to a different location, and its land being burned, and its family being exiled or murdered,
4044980	4053980	and you feel the weight of what has been done to this creature in some semblance of a past life on your shoulders
4053980	4059980	as you know that you did that to people overseas.
4059980	4069980	And then the crying stops, and you fall back into the muck, make a splash as these tattered robes,
4069980	4079980	these muddy sort of amorphous cloth and textiles kind of dissipates into mud and muck and bog.
4079980	4091980	The thick braided hair that you can see loses its bioluminescent glow, and Burl Summers comes up and reaches out his hand to you.
4091980	4096980	Son, I think I have a job for you.
4110980	4112980	War!
4129980	4131980	Destroy!
4132980	4135980	Vacuous!
4136980	4138980	Conquer!
4140980	4142980	War!
4149980	4151980	War!
4157980	4159980	War!
4164980	4166980	War!
4169980	4171980	War!
4174980	4183980	And then the camera shifts, and we see a little restaurant called Beer Eat A Taco.
4183980	4189980	And the text across the bottom of the screen says, July 7th, 2022.
4189980	4191980	Joke is just a linguistic mess.
4193980	4196980	I think it might be the funniest one we've ever done.
