1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Welcome, my brood.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,400
It is I, Wolf the Dog, DJ of the Year,

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,320
and I set upon many eggs to birth all of you

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,840
so that you may be my lifelong loyal listeners.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,220
I think, maybe that was a dream.

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,560
Ever since I started eating grease too close to Betty

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,200
by time, I've been dreaming up all kinds of crazy shit.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,920
And oh yeah, I'm the host of this here radio show.

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,920
Y'all find yourselves tuned into 694.2 PTBP.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,560
All I ask from my hatchlings is for a little love,

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,960
maybe a little forehead kiss, or some fan mail.

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,080
And hey, would you look at what we got here, y'all?

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,160
This episode's Howlin' with Wolf is from Eric

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,680
in Jersey City, New Jersey,

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,840
who tagged at Pretending Pod on the internet.

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,640
Well done, my good and faithful Eric

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,120
in Jersey City, New Jersey, Eric writes.

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,560
Looking for a little more spookiness in your life?

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,720
Check out The Nature of My Game podcast,

20
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,400
a story-focused actual play of investigation,

21
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,600
strangeness, and fear.

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,600
Each season of the show features a new horror-themed RPG,

23
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,020
a new cast, and a new story.

24
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,020
And soon, we'll be kicking off a Yellow King RPG campaign,

25
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,540
playing the yet-to-be-released Casilda song

26
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,560
from Pelgrain Press.

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,860
Listen to The Nature of My Game

28
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,380
wherever you get your podcasts,

29
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:44,180
and a huge thanks to PTBP for the inspiration.

30
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:48,540
Well, New Jersey Eric, I'm glad that my radio show

31
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,180
could be of inspiration to ya,

32
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,700
although I'm not too sure what a RPG is

33
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,500
or what an actual play is.

34
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,480
Are there theoretical play podcasts?

35
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,820
Damn, metaphysical ones.

36
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,240
I gotta start listening to these damn things someday.

37
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,540
If you wanna write up something for your wolf to howl,

38
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,860
just tag at Pretending Pod on the internet

39
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,620
or write up a five-star review and make sure I seize it.

40
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,900
Heck, if you write up a five-star review

41
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,660
and you title that bad boy howling with wolf

42
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,420
or something to that effect,

43
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,260
I might even just read your review right here on air.

44
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,580
And speaking of airwaves,

45
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,940
we have a privileged, confidential RSS feed

46
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,500
that you can get access to

47
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,040
by supporting this show financially

48
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,480
at patreon.com slash Pretending Pod.

49
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,800
It's basically like having a tin can on a string

50
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,260
coming into the window of your bedroom,

51
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,780
and that string is strung all the way over to me

52
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,400
here in my current studio,

53
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,500
and it's not attached to a tin can on my end.

54
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,340
Ha ha ha, no way.

55
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,300
It's attached to my soul,

56
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,060
and my greedy soul needs feeding,

57
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,120
so heed my reprieve and hop on that secret feed,

58
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,500
and you will receive, I kid you not,

59
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,660
47 bonus episodes for just five bucks.

60
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,020
That's like less than a dime and a penny per bonus episode,

61
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,680
and the most recent ones

62
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,060
are a side-splittingly goofy two-parter

63
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,100
of the boys playing a mad gab-style party RPG

64
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,140
called The People and Patrick,

65
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,900
wherein they played little alien guys

66
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,740
inside a human Jaeger just trying to fit into society.

67
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,740
And not only do you get access

68
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,500
to that thick bonus feed of 47 episodes

69
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,860
you ain't heard yet,

70
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,500
you also get the satisfaction of knowing

71
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,620
that you support the dudes who make this show happen,

72
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,060
like me, Wolf the Dog, and my producer,

73
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,060
and some guys named Tim, John, Luis, and Zarch,

74
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,860
and that's pretty neat.

75
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,060
Oh, you don't have to type out

76
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,380
HTTPS semicolon slash slash

77
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,940
www.patreon.com slash pretending pod.

78
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,740
That's fine, because the links are in the show notes.

79
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,900
I gave up measuring time in SI.

80
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,140
That's a non-sec-quitter,

81
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,780
but that don't mean it ain't time for the news.

82
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,660
Last time, the can crew had a difficult conversation

83
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,860
with Kaylee Silver, difficult due to the presence

84
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,700
of the bagged waxy substance they carried,

85
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,820
but Kaylee did tell them her best friend, Kaylee Gold,

86
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,060
had gotten partially inside her

87
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,180
after Silver took a swig of a new beer

88
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,860
she had brewed with yeasts from the Godel Company,

89
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,340
and that wasn't even the wildest part of last episode.

90
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,300
Julius kicked off a jailbreak attempt

91
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,780
by breaking his dad's shackles

92
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,540
with Dr. Brock Hargrave's unnaturally sharp shovel,

93
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,540
and after Burl took down some guards,

94
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,260
Julius followed in hot pursuit,

95
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,060
taking us now to the moment between Cal Colorado,

96
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,380
Stevie, and Beck Wilder,

97
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,780
where they decide if they want to follow the summers

98
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,340
or bail with their friends in the air.

99
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,420
It's Alter Girl with My Life Is Great

100
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,980
and It Is All My Fault.

101
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,980
My life is all my fault

102
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,980
Cause my life is great

103
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,980
And it's all mine

104
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,980
Cause my life is great

105
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,980
And it's all my fault

106
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:59,980
Episode 36, Let's Go

107
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,980
Okay Beck, here we are, standing at the precipice.

108
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,980
We either follow the green line back,

109
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,980
or we follow the bodies.

110
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,980
I mean, I think we should follow the bodies.

111
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,980
I don't want to be caught

112
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,980
without the guys who know what they're doing.

113
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,980
Like, this is weird fucking shit,

114
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,980
and I think that we should follow the bodies.

115
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,980
This is weird fucking shit,

116
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,980
and I think that we should follow the guys

117
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,980
who know how to handle weird fucking shit.

118
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,980
Cal thinks about that,

119
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,980
and he doesn't even bring up the news.

120
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,980
He realizes, like, you're right, this is real shit.

121
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,980
He doesn't have to play act about it.

122
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,980
We need to get the fuck out of here.

123
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,980
Do keep rolling though, but yes, yeah, you're right.

124
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,980
I'm kidding at all.

125
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,980
We should get moving.

126
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,980
We do. We hustle.

127
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,980
Let's go.

128
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,980
Let's go, yeah.

129
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,980
Oh yeah, did you want any input, Stevie?

130
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,980
Nope, absolutely not.

131
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,980
I'm down for whatever.

132
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,980
We got this.

133
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,980
We're not going to take his clothes.

134
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,980
That would be making the news.

135
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,980
We're not going to do that.

136
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,980
We're just running.

137
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,980
Yeah, yeah, let's go.

138
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,980
And running we shall.

139
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,980
Yeah, so you're already at the end of this hallway,

140
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,980
so you bust through the next door.

141
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,980
Bust through.

142
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,980
You probably gently open this next door.

143
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,980
Stevie goes and-

144
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,980
Use the shovel on that door!

145
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,980
Creeps around.

146
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,980
They turn.

147
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,980
They're like, what?

148
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,980
And the shovel goes through the door.

149
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,980
Stevie creeps out through the door and opens it gently

150
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,980
and sticks her head around the corner and turns back to you,

151
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,980
holding one fist in the air and then turning it into two fingers

152
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,980
and jutting them forward like, let's go.

153
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,980
I look at Gal.

154
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,980
Dude, it's like Navy Seal shit.

155
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,980
Navy Seal shit.

156
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,980
Yeah, that was cool.

157
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,980
They keep moving and coming up there is an intersection of the hallway.

158
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,980
So you are in a corridor that continues on straight

159
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,980
and then tees off at the end,

160
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:58,980
but then there's a hallway that runs through this hallway left and right.

161
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:04,980
And right as you open the door, you all see Julius and Burl Summers.

162
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,980
And Burl seemed to be counting.

163
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,980
And then you just see Burl grab Julius' shirt collar

164
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,980
and then they run together around the corner to the left,

165
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,980
15 yards away from you.

166
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,980
And sirens are going wild.

167
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,980
What did you mean by seems to be counting?

168
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,980
Is he using his fingers or is he looking at something?

169
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,980
Yeah, using his fingers and counting out loud.

170
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,980
Oh, gotcha.

171
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,980
Do you think he's got the numbers in him?

172
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,980
Oh, Beck, roll grip.

173
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,980
Fuck.

174
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,980
52.

175
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,980
I've rolled a bunch of 50, so I'm retiring these days.

176
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,980
Because I said that or because he saw that?

177
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,980
Because he saw that.

178
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,980
Okay.

179
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,980
Beck, you lose one grip and you are almost positive.

180
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,980
Then I saw an eight and a three and a C.

181
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,980
He held up four fingers on one hand, four fingers on another hand.

182
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,980
Then he held up three fingers on one hand,

183
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,980
and then he held five fingers on one hand and one finger on the other hand.

184
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,980
And you also think maybe he mouthed.

185
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,980
And he said, eight, three, six.

186
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,980
Okay, okay.

187
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,980
I like the first one.

188
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,980
That's not super weird.

189
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,980
I mean, it's the fucking weirdest.

190
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,980
But no, it is weird.

191
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,980
Thank you.

192
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,980
I'm not.

193
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,980
All the eight, three, six stuff is weird.

194
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,980
It's not weird that he was saying it necessarily

195
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,980
because he's the guy who takes care of weird stuff.

196
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,980
And so Julius told him about it.

197
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,980
And so he's, you know, making sure he got it right.

198
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,980
Did I hear you right, son?

199
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,980
Eight, three, six.

200
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,980
Eight, three, six?

201
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,980
Eight, three, six.

202
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,980
Yeah, so, you know, if you want to learn more about it,

203
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,980
we could just follow that guy.

204
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,980
I think we should go and ask him.

205
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,980
Perfect.

206
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,980
Carrot is donkey.

207
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,980
The three of you run forward and turn the corner left.

208
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,980
And as you turn the corner left, you all kind of check your right,

209
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,980
like you're looking both ways before you cross the street almost.

210
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,980
You see no one down either end of the corridor.

211
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,980
And ahead of you, you see Burl and Julius.

212
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,980
And I think we can get Luke in the room.

213
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,980
Which one worked?

214
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,980
I don't know.

215
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,980
Woo!

216
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,980
So...

217
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,980
Julius, Burl counts, lands on the number, grabs you,

218
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,980
turns the corner left, and you all begin making your way down this hallway.

219
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,980
Suddenly, Julius hollers.

220
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,980
What does it mean?

221
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:03,980
And as Julius hollers that, the blinds on the windows of the rooms

222
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,980
on either side of this corridor flick open.

223
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,980
And he also sees down the end of the hallway, back the way you came,

224
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:16,980
turning the corner that you just turned, Cal Colorado, Beck Wilder, and Stevie.

225
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,980
Julius, dude! Wait up!

226
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,980
Julius gets super calm all of a sudden and just looks at his dad.

227
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,980
There's your shovel.

228
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,980
The camera does a crazy anime zoom-in on the shovel

229
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,980
tucked underneath Stevie's arm on top of one of the bags.

230
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,980
Come on, guys!

231
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,980
Beck wants to come running up and saying,

232
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,980
What does it mean? Were you asking him about the numbers?

233
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,980
Because I saw him counting numbers!

234
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,980
Was it the 836?

235
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,980
Julius just shrugs, yep.

236
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,980
Fucking what does it mean, he says to Burl.

237
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,980
You weren't supposed to start yelling. They weren't supposed to see us.

238
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:57,980
And Burl turns and kicks open the door behind him in this hallway.

239
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,980
Julius watches him do it, and what Julius sees is his dad

240
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,980
holding a Nerf gun, just kind of jokingly kicking open the door.

241
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,980
And he looks down and he's got a Nerf gun too.

242
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,980
And he follows his dad, waving the other guys to follow him.

243
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:21,980
Cal, Beck, and Stevie see officers on either side,

244
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:27,980
one in each room with the blinds open, one on the left, one on the right.

245
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,980
And they're making their way toward the door into this corridor.

246
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,980
We're going in dexterity order.

247
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,980
Oh, fuck.

248
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,980
Who's up?

249
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,980
I've got a 70.

250
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,980
I've got a 50.

251
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,980
45.

252
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,980
So we started with Julius, who went through the door following his dad.

253
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,980
Correct.

254
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,980
Burl Summers.

255
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,980
And then we have Stevie, who immediately dips, does the same,

256
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,980
and follows, runs with the bag out the door behind Julius.

257
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,980
I would like to do that too.

258
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,980
As well would I.

259
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:02,980
Okay, so we've got two officers coming in hot pursuit of you all

260
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,980
as you run through this door.

261
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,980
We've got a long hallway.

262
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,980
This next one, we've got a long hallway,

263
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:17,980
and it has just windows on the left side into the outdoor area

264
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,980
where you see inmates in the hot July sun,

265
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,980
playing basketball, lifting weights, hanging out, playing hacky sack.

266
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,980
There seems to be a group at a table with some, like,

267
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,980
sticks and leaves splayed out in different areas on the table,

268
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,980
and you all are sprinting down this hallway.

269
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,980
I need everyone to roll athletics.

270
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,980
Pass.

271
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,980
Fail.

272
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,980
Critical fail.

273
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,980
88.

274
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,980
Cal trips on his old ass.

275
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,980
Oh, fuck Cal.

276
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,980
Ouchie, ouchie.

277
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,980
My ankle.

278
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,980
Roll a D4.

279
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,980
Ooh, ooh.

280
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,980
Ouchie, ouchie.

281
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,980
Two ouchies.

282
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,980
Carry me back.

283
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,980
I do like a sports carry, you know, getting his arm around my shoulders,

284
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,980
and now we're three-legged racing down the hall.

285
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,980
Okay.

286
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,980
Burl, and did you succeed?

287
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,980
I did.

288
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,980
Burl, Stevie, and Julius all make it to the next door.

289
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,980
Burl blasts through this next door.

290
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,980
Julius?

291
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,980
Following his dad.

292
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,980
Following his dad.

293
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,980
And Stevie stops and looks back.

294
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,980
It's okay, Stevie.

295
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,980
You can go on ahead if you have to.

296
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,980
And Stevie runs toward you, back down this long hallway,

297
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,980
and then past you, and they grab the shovel out from under their arm

298
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:03,980
and levy it forward as the door opens, and two officers come through it.

299
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,980
Stevie, no!

300
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,980
They miss, and the shovel goes right into the door

301
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,980
and just sinks itself right into the door, and as they pull back,

302
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,980
they pull a massive chunk of the door out with them,

303
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,980
and these two officers are just staring in disbelief,

304
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:29,980
one of them completely frozen, unable to handle what they just saw.

305
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,980
The shovel went through a door like it was Play-Doh.

306
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,980
The other one loosens their neck and lunges forward,

307
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,980
grabs at the shovel, Stevie pulls it back, and they are locked.

308
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,980
They both have two hands on the shovel, and they're just tugging back and forth.

309
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,980
What do you do, Joe?

310
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,980
Beck wants to pull something out of his pockets

311
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,980
to throw at the feet of the tussle to try and...

312
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,980
He wants it to be in favor of Stevie,

313
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,980
but it's really just they're going to be thrown off balance,

314
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,980
and somebody's going to win that struggle.

315
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,980
Interesting. Okay.

316
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,980
So throwing off their footing?

317
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,980
Yeah.

318
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,980
Okay.

319
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,980
All right, go ahead and roll to see what you end up finding.

320
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,980
I think you can roll a search here,

321
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:21,980
or you can roll your news skill for going through your camera bag, I guess.

322
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,980
I pass my videographer skill.

323
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,980
Okay, that'll do.

324
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,980
A bunch of mic clips.

325
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,980
Okay, yeah.

326
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,980
Yeah, just little odd-shaped mic clips.

327
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,980
I throw them back there like caltrops.

328
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,980
Good name for a TikTok segment.

329
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,980
Fail for Stevie, crit fail for the officer.

330
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,980
So kind of maybe worked?

331
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,980
Like perfectly worked.

332
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:56,980
The officer who is gripping with two hands on this shovel

333
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,980
loses their footing as one of these mic clips

334
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,980
just slips right underneath their heel

335
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,980
that they were going to put all their pressure on,

336
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,980
and it slips out from underneath them.

337
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,980
They start falling backwards.

338
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,980
Stevie can't hold on.

339
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,980
Neither can the officer as they land right on their tailbone,

340
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,980
and the shovel falls to the ground next to them.

341
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,980
The officer that is kind of dazed is slowly kind of coming out of it,

342
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,980
but it's Cal Colorado's turn.

343
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,980
Cal wants to try to hobble over there as quickly as he can.

344
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,980
Can I try a persuade roll on combat?

345
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,980
Yeah, absolutely.

346
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,980
He just shouts,

347
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,980
Wait, wait, this is a huge misunderstanding.

348
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,980
This was just a reenactment for the news.

349
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,980
Awesome.

350
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,980
Roll persuade.

351
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:55,980
70 on a 80.

352
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,980
Fuck yeah.

353
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,980
The officer succeeds, but at a lower rate,

354
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,980
and they're already blown away by the shovel,

355
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,980
and so they connect the dots.

356
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,980
This is a prop door.

357
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,980
It's a special effect.

358
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,980
It's all movie magic, as they say.

359
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,980
And he's like, Oh, oh.

360
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,980
We're at the city news, so we have pretty a big budget.

361
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,980
No, of course, of course.

362
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,980
That makes all the sense in the world.

363
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,980
Yeah, so sorry about the mic clip thing.

364
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,980
You could call the network.

365
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,980
Oh, it looks like there's a hole in my pocket.

366
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,980
Dang it.

367
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,980
They must have all spilled out of there.

368
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,980
Probably caught on one of those prison doors, so.

369
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,980
Get on up here, Batralamude.

370
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,980
Come on.

371
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,980
And he helps the other guy up.

372
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,980
Batralamude?

373
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,980
That's an amazing name.

374
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,980
Oh, you know, he doesn't like to talk about it too much.

375
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,980
No, I don't.

376
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,980
Are we going to be in the news?

377
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,980
Batralamude, I wasn't really set up for that shot,

378
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,980
but yeah, if you want to go back through that door

379
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,980
and wait for your cue.

380
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,980
Okay.

381
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,980
We'll shout at you when you need to come through.

382
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,980
Okay, sounds good.

383
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,980
Do we need to reset this door?

384
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,980
Reset the door.

385
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,980
And if you could also radio ahead to,

386
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,980
I think some of your other colleagues

387
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,980
might have taken this a little too seriously.

388
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,980
Oh, are these alarms like part of your...

389
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,980
It's all fake.

390
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,980
Well, these are the real alarms.

391
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,980
All right, well, yes, but it's a fake scenario, you see.

392
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,980
Yeah, okay.

393
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,980
For the noose.

394
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,980
Hmm, wow.

395
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,980
You could just get the word out to not resist.

396
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,980
Beck just kind of says into the air,

397
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,980
all right, we're going to reset to one.

398
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,980
Resetting everybody, resetting everybody.

399
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,980
Batralamude, you've been great.

400
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,980
Thank you.

401
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,980
What was your name, sir?

402
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,980
Nah, Jerram.

403
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,980
Jerram.

404
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,980
Jerram and Batralamude.

405
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:50,980
You two are just for Zach, huh?

406
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,980
Didn't know we were going to have so much talking to do.

407
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,980
Zach's like, names, names.

408
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:04,980
Jared, big cat, Batralamude.

409
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,980
What are they really?

410
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,980
What?

411
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,980
What are, who are those?

412
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,980
What do you mean?

413
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,980
In the Bible.

414
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,980
Oh.

415
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,980
No, I don't think either one of those are...

416
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,980
Oh, I assumed.

417
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,980
Nope.

418
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,980
Okay.

419
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,980
Nope.

420
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,980
Cool, waste of time.

421
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,980
That was the question he was, so.

422
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,980
I mean, should I have answered?

423
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,980
Yes, and.

424
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,980
Nah, I don't do that shit.

425
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,980
If the plan is working, they're going back through the door.

426
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,980
And we're going.

427
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,980
Running away.

428
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,980
Yeah, we're leaving.

429
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:43,980
As you run away, Jerram looks through the hole in the door and he's like,

430
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,980
I thought you said you were going to reset the door to the...

431
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,980
Props department will be here in a minute.

432
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,980
We've got to go to makeup.

433
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:57,980
And the three of you run through the next door.

434
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,980
And on the other side, you see that.

435
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,980
It's so great that this worked.

436
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:12,980
I thought we were going to die.

437
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,980
I've had dreams like this.

438
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,980
I didn't realize I could just tell them it was for the news.

439
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,980
It's for the news.

440
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,980
Hey, buddy.

441
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,980
Calm down.

442
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:33,980
When the door opens, Julius is pleading with Burl Summers as they stand at the precipice of another corner.

443
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,980
And once again, Burl is counting.

444
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,980
He looks at Beck.

445
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,980
He's doing it again.

446
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,980
735, 736, 737.

447
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,980
He hasn't said the numbers yet, but it's okay.

448
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,980
He's going to say the numbers.

449
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,980
We've got to get to him.

450
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,980
We've got to get to him.

451
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,980
There's still like 100.

452
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,980
Yeah, there's a lot of numbers before he gets to the one that I'm scared of.

453
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,980
We can knock him over or something.

454
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,980
I don't know.

455
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,980
I think he's counting to make sure that we go at the right time.

456
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,980
He's got the plan.

457
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,980
Oh.

458
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,980
Oh.

459
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:07,980
And that took me a while to say, so he's probably at a much higher number.

460
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,980
812.

461
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,980
813.

462
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,980
So we're just following the numbers?

463
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,980
Did we let him do it?

464
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,980
I mean, which way are we going?

465
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,980
Point.

466
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:23,980
He points, but then he gives you the don't go hand motion and then holds up a finger.

467
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:29,980
You're about to fucking say 836, and that's going to mean something to you, and I want it to mean something to me.

468
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,980
834, 835, 836.

469
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,980
Let's go.

470
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,980
Fucking told you.

471
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,980
And then he dips around the corner.

472
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,980
Julius starts running.

473
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,980
Beck doesn't immediately go and turns to Stevie and Cal.

474
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,980
It's the fucking numbers, but maybe they're a good thing.

475
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,980
We gotta go.

476
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,980
We gotta go.

477
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,980
Let's go.

478
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,980
Let's go.

479
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,980
Let's go.

480
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:59,980
And at the exact moment that you all turn this corner and start running out, you see a door in the lobby close, and you are now in the lobby, the foyer of this jail.

481
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:09,980
But the way that this escape has been timed out, there's only one person in the area, and it's Officer-

482
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,980
Peeler!

483
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,980
Peeler!

484
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,980
Peeler, open the door!

485
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,980
We got it for the shot.

486
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,980
Peeler, have you heard about the reenactment for the news?

487
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,980
Well, yeah, somebody sent through on the radio about the-

488
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,980
We need you to buzz the door open so we don't lose our shot.

489
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,980
Hurry!

490
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,980
Golden hour, Peeler!

491
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,980
Golden hour!

492
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,980
And then Julius starts running towards the door, hoping it is gonna open.

493
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,980
Awesome.

494
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,980
Roll, persuade, probably Cal.

495
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,980
75 on an 80.

496
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,980
Yes!

497
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,980
He succeeds with a 62.

498
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,980
Ooh!

499
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,980
That would've been scary.

500
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:53,980
As Julius makes it to the door, the red light goes green, and Julius's massive thighs slam into the metal bar that open.

501
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,980
Ka-junk!

502
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,980
Peeler, out of the lobby and into the world.

503
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,980
Woohoo!

504
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,980
That was fun!

505
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,980
Oh my god, we're gonna get to keep doing this!

506
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,980
And he's like looking at his dad, stoked.

507
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,980
Beck grabs Burl by the collar and pulls him in.

508
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:20,980
On the front steps of this beautiful city jail with this oppressive architecture, big concrete columns, big concrete stairs.

509
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:29,980
And at the top, where a rocky-like figure might feel victory, Beck feels what?

510
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,980
From the outside it would look like anger, but inside it's pleading help.

511
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,980
What do they fucking mean?

512
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:45,980
Burl smiles a stringy smile.

513
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,980
What is a stringy smile?

514
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,980
Oh, it's like, yeah.

515
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,980
Saliva-y.

516
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:57,980
His teeth become floss in it.

517
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,980
Flossy.

518
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,980
Ew, flossy teeth.

519
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,980
Somebody just leaves fucking strands trailing.

520
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,980
Oh, I call it my baleens.

521
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,980
That one over my head.

522
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,980
It's the plates that whales use to trap plankton.

523
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,980
Oh, nice.

524
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,980
Nerd.

525
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,980
It's whale teeth.

526
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,980
Uh, more people than just nerds watch fucking planet Earth, Luke.

527
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,980
Oh, never mind.

528
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,980
What, you think just stoners and nerds are watching?

529
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,980
There it is.

530
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,980
Yeah, no, you're right.

531
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,980
Julius is looking at his dad like he wants to know too.

532
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,980
I don't know. I'm sorry.

533
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,980
Then why say it?

534
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,980
It works.

535
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,980
It fucking works.

536
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,980
We need to go.

537
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,980
And he dips down the stairs.

538
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,980
Where's your ride?

539
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,980
Did we just park in front?

540
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,980
Yeah.

541
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,980
I think so.

542
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,980
I did, yeah.

543
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,980
I'll drive if you want.

544
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,980
And he kind of just does a little jog down the steps.

545
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,980
Like that all didn't just happen.

546
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,980
Beep, beep.

547
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,980
Can we let them use...

548
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,980
What if we just called you guys an Uber or something?

549
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,980
That's a betting.

550
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,980
That's still a betting.

551
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,980
We already abetted.

552
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,980
We did the ruse.

553
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,980
We abetted.

554
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,980
We did do a ruse.

555
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,980
We abetted.

556
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,980
You're saying in the can van as you're driving away from the crime.

557
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,980
The full blown crime.

558
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,980
We are a betting.

559
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,980
We are a betting.

560
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,980
Julius is driving away and just being like,

561
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,980
yeah, you guys are in now.

562
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,980
I told you.

563
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,980
Holy shit.

564
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,980
Beck, we're going to have to...

565
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,980
We're going to have to...

566
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,980
Are you guys hungry?

567
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,980
Destroy that footage.

568
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,980
I mean, or...

569
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,980
Oh, you're right.

570
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,980
The honorable thing to do is to send it to the police ourselves.

571
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,980
Yeah, but like later.

572
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,980
Does Burl have anything to say about that?

573
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,980
Burl is just giving you big eyes with a knowing look.

574
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,980
He's giving him a little fist bump.

575
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,980
Thanks for getting me out.

576
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,980
Yeah, I mean, I figured you'd maybe use the shovel,

577
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,980
but that was interesting too.

578
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,980
Abet, here we are.

579
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,980
Well, you use the shovel.

580
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,980
True.

581
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,980
Anything for you.

582
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,980
Are you guys hungry?

583
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,980
You're probably hungry.

584
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,980
What do you want?

585
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,980
Oh, you know what I could really go for is tacos.

586
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,980
And Julius is just going to aimlessly drive until he sees tacos.

587
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,980
Julius, dude, are you okay, dude?

588
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,980
Yeah.

589
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,980
My dad's here.

590
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,980
You seem really unaffected by the fact that we just broke your dad out of jail

591
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,980
and like almost got in jail ourselves.

592
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,980
Julius is kind of like, what are you talking about?

593
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,980
Whatever, Beck.

594
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,980
We got my dad's ear.

595
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,980
Going to get tacos.

596
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,980
I give a worried glance to Cal.

597
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,980
Hey, Mr. Summers.

598
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,980
Yeah.

599
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,980
Can we have a talk about your parenting style?

600
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,980
What can you learn?

601
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,980
I was very confident.

602
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,980
What's going on here between you and your boy?

603
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:10,980
I've raised Julius to take care of the actual world,

604
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,980
the underlying reality that exists,

605
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,980
that we hide away from those who would otherwise be affected.

606
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

607
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,980
We know all about that.

608
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,980
I live in the shadows.

609
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,980
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

610
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,980
Dad, I forgot to tell you, you're going to be stoked.

611
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,980
Typh?

612
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,980
No.

613
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,980
Really?

614
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,980
Yeah.

615
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,980
What happened?

616
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,980
I killed him.

617
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,980
Wait, you killed him?

618
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,980
I killed him.

619
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,980
That's what he tells us.

620
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,980
I thought we were compartmentalizing that.

621
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,980
This is what I want to talk about.

622
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,980
You have a strange effect on this boy,

623
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,980
and I don't think it's entirely natural.

624
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,980
Speaking of the dark weirdness of the world or whatnot.

625
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,980
Something about hearing Cal and his tone of voice

626
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,980
kind of snaps Julius back a little bit.

627
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,980
As he's driving, he starts to just sweat.

628
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,980
There.

629
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,980
See?

630
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,980
Julius.

631
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,980
Julius, are you in there, boy?

632
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,980
And he's like shaking, and he has to pull the van over.

633
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,980
What are you doing?

634
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,980
His heart is like racing.

635
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,980
He needs a medic.

636
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,980
Can you tell?

637
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,980
We have to keep going.

638
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,980
What the fuck?

639
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,980
We did not go in there to do that.

640
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,980
No, I mean, I didn't know that you were even coming today.

641
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,980
I didn't know that this was happening either.

642
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,980
Oh my fucking God.

643
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,980
We have to destroy that tape.

644
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,980
Why were you filming?

645
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,980
We do have to destroy that tape.

646
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,980
Guys, what if it's the thing that proves we were right all along?

647
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,980
In what way?

648
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,980
I don't know.

649
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,980
The numbers are a thing.

650
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,980
Hold on.

651
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:49,980
Julius starts driving again, maybe towards tacos,

652
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,980
probably just aimlessly.

653
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,980
I think we got to tell him.

654
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,980
Like, we got to fill him in.

655
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,980
And then they fill him in.

656
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:04,980
Isn't that fucking crazy?

657
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,980
I mean, are you guys cool with that?

658
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,980
We're filling Burl in on all of our escapades.

659
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,980
Yeah.

660
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,980
Beck is fine with it because he is using that as part of the argument to not destroy the footage.

661
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,980
It's all linked.

662
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,980
See?

663
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,980
At the end of the day, we're going to have this body of evidence.

664
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,980
It's going to be irrefutable.

665
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,980
Bodies.

666
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,980
Yeah, there's been a lot of bodies.

667
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,980
Is it for the greater good?

668
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,980
Is it?

669
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,980
This might be one of those things where the ends justify the means?

670
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,980
Oh, yeah.

671
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,980
Definitely.

672
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,980
Obviously.

673
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,980
I mean, think about what we're doing.

674
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,980
What are we doing?

675
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,980
What are you doing?

676
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:43,980
We're learning about the world and how it works and we work in the shadows.

677
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:48,980
And we keep the world safe from that which they cannot know.

678
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:53,980
You know, I kicked the ass of a creep a lot like you just a few hours ago.

679
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,980
Julius is so offended.

680
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,980
Don't talk to daddy like that.

681
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,980
I knew it.

682
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,980
I knew there was some weird thing.

683
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,980
You went to him so quickly with his whole daddy bed.

684
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,980
I was just looking for somebody.

685
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,980
And now I've got two.

686
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,980
I have to be everybody's fucking dad?

687
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,980
No.

688
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,980
You don't.

689
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,980
He has a dad.

690
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,980
But look at you.

691
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,980
Come on, look at me.

692
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,980
Look at you.

693
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,980
You're three weird strands.

694
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,980
We just broke you out of jail.

695
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,980
You hypnotized your son into breaking you out of jail.

696
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,980
I mean, he-

697
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,980
Who would call that good parenting?

698
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,980
Hmm?

699
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,980
I'd call it good sunning for sure.

700
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,980
Thanks.

701
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,980
Good job, son.

702
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,980
Dad, maybe tell him about the rat guy.

703
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,980
Tell me about the rat guy.

704
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,980
You want to know about Matthew?

705
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,980
Oh my God.

706
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,980
Beck, are you filming?

707
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,980
Keep driving, Julius.

708
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,980
Yes, sir.

709
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,980
Toward tacos.

710
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,980
Julius types in, best tacos near me.

711
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:03,980
And he spends a little too much time actually reading the reviews of every place.

712
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,980
I want birria tacos.

713
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,980
Oh, okay.

714
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:09,980
Julius finds one with birria tacos and heads there.

715
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,980
And the place is called Beer E A Taco.

716
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,980
Like beer and one taco?

717
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,980
Beer and a taco in English and Spanish.

718
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,980
Beer E A Taco.

719
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,980
While we're heading to Beer E A Taco, Mr. Summers.

720
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,980
Yeah.

721
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,980
Why don't you tell me about Matthew?

722
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,980
Matthew was kind.

723
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,980
He was good.

724
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:44,980
He was, well, I assume Julius already explained his physical abnormalities, but Matthew could feel.

725
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,980
Matthew could kind of talk.

726
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:57,980
He could communicate after a while in his own way through, you know, bits of squeaks, but seemingly had a human vocal cord set on him.

727
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:07,980
So the squeaks were varied enough to where, you know, I could make out kind of the situation and we would talk for hours.

728
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,980
They fucking took him.

729
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,980
The firm?

730
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,980
The firm.

731
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,980
The seventh.

732
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,980
Whatever you want to call them.

733
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,980
The government.

734
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,980
The United States of America.

735
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,980
Dad, we found a place where there's a lot of Matthews.

736
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,980
Hey, what do you mean?

737
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,980
The whole Godel thing we were talking about?

738
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,980
How it's big and it's bad?

739
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,980
There are animal people there, sure.

740
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,980
I don't know if they're Matthews.

741
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,980
Yeah, it seems like maybe some of these could talk.

742
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,980
Like really just talk talk.

743
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:45,980
We had discussed these being separate, whole separate deals and perhaps leading an army of the rat men to defeat these other animal people.

744
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,980
You never saw another rat man like Matthew?

745
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:58,980
No, I wish I wish I could have. I wish I would have made friends with the whole army, but no, just Matthew.

746
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,980
Oh.

747
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,980
I hope he's okay.

748
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,980
Did you ever find out like where he came from?

749
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:26,980
He used to draw this, you know, I tried different ways of communicating with him and anytime that he could get his hands on something to, you know, make a design with or draw something out, it was the same design over and over and he grabs a notebook and starts sketching and

750
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:30,980
Beck is rewinding through his footage to get to the it pit.

751
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:45,980
And he holds up a sketch right as you arrive at the footage of the it pit and there is a singular difference actually between the design that he is sketched.

752
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:49,980
It does not have an upside down cross.

753
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,980
All the other symbols are present.

754
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,980
It didn't have an upside down cross.

755
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,980
I see the upside down church when I smell God.

756
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:03,980
We were in Godel Gorge and this was scrawled on the walls of a really fucking terrible place, dude.

757
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,980
Oh, we've been in the it pit, baby.

758
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,980
I think it's where they kept the animal people.

759
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,980
Yeah, and that's what he's, yeah.

760
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,980
How long have they been doing this?

761
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,980
Oh my God.

762
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,980
Since before you were alive.

763
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,980
I think we gotta go back.

764
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,980
Dad, they have like jumpy, bouncy sidewalks?

765
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:29,980
I mean, we know for sure now Matthew has some connection to Godel's Gorge.

766
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,980
It would appear that way.

767
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:38,980
And Kaylee got her yeast that makes her want to eat people or they go in her stomach or something and that's from Godel.

768
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,980
It made her go crazy.

769
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,980
The same happened to Dr. Brock apparently.

770
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,980
Who knows who else?

771
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:51,980
And every time I've smelled that yeast, yeasts, I see the upside down church.

772
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,980
Yeast, you've smelled what's in the bag, but we think they put what's in the bag in the yeasts.

773
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:02,980
Well, either way, it's the same trigger and it makes me see the upside down church with blood and bodies and I smell God.

774
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:07,980
I see like visions of like things happened and things that are happening.

775
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,980
I haven't seen the church myself yet.

776
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,980
And Fred's not dead?

777
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,980
Oh yeah, what's that about?

778
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,980
Why does he want to pretend that he's dead?

779
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:20,980
Maybe to, uh, hell, I don't know. I just cover the news.

780
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,980
I don't want to make sense of it.

781
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,980
That's for the historians.

782
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,980
Julius turns off his maps and is going to start driving towards the bridge.

783
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:40,980
Uh, Julius, seems you turned away from beer-y-ah tacos.

784
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,980
Yeah. Um, are we not going to the taco?

785
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,980
I think we gotta go. I think, I think we gotta go.

786
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,980
To?

787
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,980
To the hole.

788
00:36:48,980 --> 00:37:02,980
Oh, no, I'd rather not. I've got to meet, uh, a mysterious caller at a jazz den tonight.

789
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:06,980
Julius is just going to kind of blankly stare ahead and keep driving.

790
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:10,980
Are you, you're thinking about jumping into the hole? Is that what your plan is here?

791
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,980
I don't know, maybe.

792
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,980
Uh, Burl, can you speak to your boy here?

793
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:20,980
Well, I mean, if he wants to go down the hole, we're going to need, what, some sort of scuba gear?

794
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,980
And like backup, like a lot of backup.

795
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,980
We've talked about this. It's, it's really dumb to go there right now.

796
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:34,980
We should bring, if not an army of rat men, I don't know, some, uh,

797
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,980
do you have any mean friends?

798
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:43,980
Julius immediately starts thinking of all the people he's met through Delta Green.

799
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,980
Oh, do you remember any numbers?

800
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,980
Uh, yeah.

801
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,980
Three, six.

802
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,980
Do you remember anyone's numbers?

803
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,980
Yeah.

804
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,980
He starts heading back to Buri, uh, taco.

805
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,980
Should we like rally your guys' troops?

806
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:02,980
Oh, this could be fun. Get the old crew back together. Well, not the last old crew, but-

807
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,980
No, they got caught. No offense.

808
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,980
Oh, maybe the bog job? Bog job crew?

809
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,980
Yeah, bog job crew.

810
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,980
Yeah.

811
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,980
Should we tell Diggory?

812
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,980
No, I think we should absolutely not tell Diggory.

813
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:18,980
Okay. Maybe we should bring that doctor with us.

814
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,980
And he looks at Cal and Beck.

815
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,980
Are you kidnapping us?

816
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,980
No, we're-

817
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:29,980
I mean, I'm not fucking going either. We're going to hang back, I think, and they're going to go down the hole with the crew.

818
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,980
Wait, Stevie, you don't- I mean like-

819
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,980
No, I'm not fucking going down there. Are you kidding me?

820
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:39,980
I don't exactly want to either, but like, we've been working on this for a while now. We need to see it through to the end, don't you?

821
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:45,980
You saw what that was down there. I'm with Cal. We're not going down there unless we have an army of Ant-Man coming in behind us.

822
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,980
This doesn't- yeah.

823
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:51,980
Right. I'm not saying we go now. I'm saying we call up our guys. We go get some tacos.

824
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,980
But who needs the bog job guys when you've got the US Marines?

825
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,980
I don't know if-

826
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,980
I mean, the bog job guys are kind of more up for this sort of challenge.

827
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,980
And the Marines might-

828
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,980
What's the world sees what's going on there in our news story?

829
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,980
Do you think the Godels and the Marines don't work together?

830
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,980
The boys got a point.

831
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,980
The Navy then.

832
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,980
And it's all mine

833
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:39,980
Cause my life is great

834
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:54,980
So out of character, in my head, I was like, oh shit, if Julius and his dad want to go down with a couple of dudes from the bog job, you guys could create characters that are the bog job crew.

835
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:59,980
That would be fun. And then we could send that crew in together into the hole.

836
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,980
Yeah. I like that.

837
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,980
That would be cool.

838
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:02,980
That sounds fun.

839
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,980
Totally.

840
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,980
And then Cal and Beck don't die.

841
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,980
Exactly.

842
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,980
We could just strap GoPros to our heads. That way it's documented.

843
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,980
Perfect. That's what I'm talking about right there.

844
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:17,980
And Burl Summers is now going to be my Pat Jack Nicholson impression.

845
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:21,980
She went, Jack, it's a good choice for your whole creepy, weird, evil vibe.

846
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,980
Yeah. I was just going higher.

847
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,980
It's more sinister that way.

848
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:26,980
Yeah.

849
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:40,980
Well, maybe, uh, I mean, if you guys, you know, I, I understand you don't want to come like my dad and I we've been fighting this shit for years, but I mean, you can talk your way out of stuff, but I don't know about in Godel's Gorge really.

850
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,980
What if you just flew a drone down with us?

851
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,980
No, no, no.

852
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,980
No, Cal, let's think about that.

853
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,980
Let's not think about that.

854
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:57,980
We would get the footage we need and no harm would be coming our way.

855
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,980
No harm? No harm? From those robot freaks? No harm?

856
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,980
I would be in complete control, Cal.

857
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,980
I don't trust drones.

858
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,980
Why?

859
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,980
It's not...

860
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,980
Okay, I'm sorry.

861
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,980
I pull Stevia's eye.

862
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,980
Cal, yeah.

863
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,980
They scare him.

864
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,980
Yeah, clearly.

865
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:22,980
No, Cal, I would be in total control of it. There wouldn't even be any kind of AI sentience on board.

866
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,980
What about a flying camera instead?

867
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:35,980
We got the job done just well enough in my day without flying cameras or, or, or the G-spot or, or any of this newfangled nonsense.

868
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,980
The news was serviceable and accurate.

869
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:47,980
Julius looks at it back and just kind of shrugs and winks like, yeah, sure, we won't.

870
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,980
Yeah, we just won't.

871
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,980
You can watch, you can watch our GoPro head, head footage.

872
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,980
Perfect. Okay, just the GoPros.

873
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,980
I think I've got some of their numbers still and Julius starts going through his phone.

874
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:04,980
He searches bog and it's like, it's like J-bog, Q-bog.

875
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,980
All right, who's J and who's Q?

876
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,980
My name's Joe.

877
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,980
Perfect.

878
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,980
That won't be confusing at all.

879
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,980
I mean, it'd be less confusing if, like, if I was Joe.

880
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,980
Oh shit, what the fuck? Is this thing on?

881
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:47,980
Ah, hey, it's Wolf and I'm here with a brand new track that'll make you smack your dad for not introducing it to you sooner.

882
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,980
It's Time Walk with War.

883
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:24,980
Destroy

884
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:31,980
Vacuus

885
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:35,980
Conquer

886
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:42,980
War

887
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:48,980
Welcome, everyone, to somewhere in the middle of episode 36 of season two of Pretending to be People.

888
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:56,980
And we are blessed, we are honored, we are humbled and fucking stoked to have a guest joining us this evening.

889
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,980
You may know her from season three of the Glass Cannon Network's Get in the Trunk.

890
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:07,980
You may know her from Time for Chaos, the GCN's playthrough of Massenar Lethetepe, or their live shows, or their upcoming show Gatewalkers.

891
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:11,980
You may know her as the queen of new game whodis.

892
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:14,980
It's Kate Stamets!

893
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,980
I forgot I did all those things. I was like, season three of what?

894
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,980
How was that? How was playing Delta Green with, uh, with Glass Cannon?

895
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:32,980
That was fun. I think that was the one season that Grant ran, so, like, it was just fun.

896
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:38,980
I like, like, usually Troy's the one who, like, runs us through things, so it's always fun having someone else run me through something.

897
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:46,980
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Any time I can convince one of these other folks to take the, take the reins, uh, I enjoy it thoroughly.

898
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:52,980
He really likes, um, getting to inflict revenge as a player for all the plans of his we've messed up.

899
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,980
Sounds right.

900
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:57,980
I'm running a game on Tuesday, and I think you're gonna die, probably.

901
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:58,980
Oh, hell yeah.

902
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:04,980
It's best to just sideline his character as quickly as possible to make things, make things go a lot smoothly.

903
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:10,980
Well, Kate, for those of our listeners who aren't familiar with all that rad shit that you've been up to, how'd you, uh-

904
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,980
Did you say rat shit or rad shit?

905
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:13,980
All that rat-

906
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:14,980
Same thing.

907
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,980
Rat shit that you've been up to?

908
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:25,980
How'd you, how'd you dive into, uh, role-playing? What got you started in this hobby?

909
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:29,980
Well, so, like, my husband and I, like, we had, like, this itch we needed to scratch.

910
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,980
That sounds weird when I say my husband.

911
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,980
It sounds like the start of a great delta gaming scenario.

912
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,980
It's hard to play games like this when you're older.

913
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:42,980
Like, it's hard to find a group to play with, someone to run you through it, so we played with, like, um, at, like, a local shop near us in Brooklyn.

914
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:50,980
It's like you paid, I don't remember how much it was, and someone there runs you and other people that are local through, like, an encounter. It was D&D 5E.

915
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:58,980
For those of you who can't see Kate, she seems to be in her 70s or 80s, so it's hard to find, you know, people your age to, to play with. That's not true.

916
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,980
You just said you were older, and I was like, wait, what?

917
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:08,980
No, no, I mean, like, it's hard to find, like, other people who are gonna make the same amount of commitment, like, they want, like, I wanna play all the time, and-

918
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:09,980
Yes.

919
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:22,980
Like, finding someone who wants to GM, it's, like, hard, so we did that, and that helped for a minute, but we were playing with strangers, and then I kinda accidentally started playing with Glass Cannon, so, like, I'm, I'm good now, my itch is scratched.

920
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:23,980
Hell yeah.

921
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,980
Just like saying.

922
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:25,980
Trying to find a way out of it.

923
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,980
You're like, how do I get on this fucking train?

924
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,980
I think we're gonna get real itchy tonight.

925
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:31,980
Real itchy tonight?

926
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:32,980
Yeah.

927
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:33,980
Yeah, well-

928
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:34,980
In the bog.

929
00:46:34,980 --> 00:47:02,980
There's a lot to get through, I realized, as I was, uh, writing for this arc, because it starts on Tuesday, April 18th, 2017, and the text at the bottom of the screen in your mind types out the date as we set our scene here in the past, over five years before this absurd jailbreak that just took place in the present day of Thursday, July 7th, 2022.

930
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:14,980
But, back here in the spring of 2017, we see a team of six making their way through soppingly saturated soil in thick, dense woods.

931
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:19,980
Now, let's get a brief rundown of who's who on this job before we dive in.

932
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:23,980
First off, we already know Burl and Julius Summers are here.

933
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,980
Burl looks almost the exact same.

934
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:34,980
He's a sinewy, middle-aged dude with long, black, stringy hair and three long whiskers on his chin.

935
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,980
Luke, what's Julius' vibe five years ago, 2017? Any different? Same?

936
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:43,980
He, uh, would be, let's see, math is so hard.

937
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:44,980
Nuts.

938
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:45,980
24 years old.

939
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:46,980
That's 29 minus 5.

940
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:53,980
That is. I mean, he's basically the same Julius, just younger, huge thighs, just hanging out with his dad.

941
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:58,980
Hanging out with his dad. So, huge thighs. What are you wearing in this boggy sort of environment?

942
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:02,980
I assume everyone has, like, big rubber boots on to kind of trudge their way through this situation.

943
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:19,980
He's looking very Duck Dynasty. He's got, like, a camo thermal sweater on, camo cargo pants, big rubber duck boots, and, uh, yeah.

944
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:20,980
Rat.

945
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:21,980
Rat.

946
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:34,980
And, uh, then we see, leading the group, there's a local guide with this team, kind of taking the front of the pack, making their way through this boggy terrain.

947
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:39,980
And that is going to be Mr. Judt Harry.

948
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:46,980
Yeah, that's me. That's, uh, that's Norman Sumter. People who know him call him Stump.

949
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:55,980
Uh, he's got this, he's got long, long, long gray hair that he keeps in a real nice tight ponytail that runs down his back.

950
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:01,980
And he's got equally gray and straight and thin and long gray beard down the front.

951
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:07,980
He's wearing, uh, these aviator glasses that he can flip up, have shades as a flip up there.

952
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:16,980
And, uh, his teeth are kind of bad and he's kind of, he's kind of thin and scraggly all over, but he's also a little bit like live on his feet.

953
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:23,980
And he looks like there's kind of a, an intensity to him. And, uh, yeah, he's kind of leading this group right now.

954
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:28,980
And he's, uh, he, he, it looks like he is Legolas-ing his way through these woods.

955
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:34,980
He's seeing things that you guys aren't seeing and he's pointing at things and he's doing maneuvers with his hands that you guys kind of understand.

956
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,980
And he's not saying a goddamn word to Frodo.

957
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,980
What kind of music does he like?

958
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:42,980
Good question.

959
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,980
Oh, he's, uh, CCR for sure. REO Speedwagon.

960
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,980
Just touring the county fairs of America.

961
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:51,980
Uh-huh. Styx.

962
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,980
Hell yeah, dude. Come sail away.

963
00:49:54,980 --> 00:50:00,980
Midway through the group, we've got a, uh, a young woman compared to Stump.

964
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:03,980
Caitlin Stamets. Who, who do we see here?

965
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:12,980
You see a 35 year old, like light blonde sugar, sort of length hair, brown eyes. Her name's Phoebe, Phoebe Richards.

966
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:19,980
She's a millennial in tech, but then she also has like a woo woo side, which I think is what the kids are calling that these days.

967
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:28,980
Um, so like she's really smart and gifted. She's a computer scientist, but she also like, you know, always has a clear quartz in her bra.

968
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:37,980
Um, she, she wears sock martens. She's like mildly alt. She might have an iced coffee as she like rolls up to you and she's like swishing it.

969
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:49,980
And then, uh, another, is it an old man, Thomas? Are you playing an old man? Just a middle aged man? When I, when I read your character.

970
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:50,980
There's an age.

971
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:54,980
There's an age. Well, I'm going to stop talking about your character. Just tell me about him.

972
00:50:54,980 --> 00:51:00,980
There's a young man at this point, five years younger than when you'll see him later. Uh, he's about 25 at this point.

973
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:07,980
Um, I don't think anybody would call him a stud, uh, unless they confused him for like a, a plank of wood.

974
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:19,980
He is, he's live, but real bony, just in all the wrong ways. He's covered in more grit and dirt than it seems like he could have accrued in the time they've been out here.

975
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:30,980
So it must've been on him from the start. He's wearing like tan overalls and a t-shirt that was probably white at one point, but it's just covered in mysterious, like black powders and things.

976
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:40,980
And you can't really see his face because he's just got this mass of messy, like thick hair and these giant Coke bottle glasses that are kind of peeking out through it.

977
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,980
He looks like a weird straw robot almost.

978
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:47,980
Amazing. Oh, I love that. And what was his name?

979
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,980
Mo Gibson. Mo Gibson. Mo Gibson.

980
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:59,980
The sixth person you see in this crew, right? One, two, three, four, five, six. Yeah, the sixth person is Agent Lee.

981
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:19,980
Agent Lee is a fresh faced gentleman from Langley and he is, unfortunately for him, wearing his like suit and dress shoes in this bog, tied, tied tight all the way up to the top, top button, buttoned.

982
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:27,980
And he is just constantly complaining about his dress shoes getting wet.

983
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:40,980
And he's talking about how he's going to have blisters later, but this team, your team is trudging through the isolated wetlands that are the Southern Appalachian mountain bogs of North Carolina.

984
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:56,980
You were sent here under the guise of official government business to find out why construction has been repeatedly halted on a refined oil pipeline being installed through this almost entirely uninhabited landscape, uninhabited landscape.

985
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:14,980
And when you finally made it to the job site with the necessary help of your local guide, Stump, you found it abandoned. Mobile trailers, big yellow machines for excavation, stacks and stacks of pipe segments all sat silently undisturbed, stagnant.

986
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:22,980
And after exploring the base of operations further, no paperwork has been touched nor checklists marked off in three days.

987
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:27,980
And that's when you heard the voice of your local guide holler out that he'd found something strange.

988
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:31,980
Found something strange!

989
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:40,980
Didn't even put anything in my little notes here. I was hoping that would happen.

990
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,980
Look at how weird this is folks. Come here.

991
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:52,980
And the weird thing that Norman Sumter, aka Stump, is kind of like poking at, maybe like even lifting it out like of the mud with a multi-tool.

992
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:59,980
He's found a thick braided rope covered in the mud of the bog like it had been buried.

993
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:10,980
And a couple crews worth of footsteps on either side leading away, lead away from the job site, deeper into the wooded and wet bog lands.

994
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:16,980
And giving this rope a solid tug, it was clearly anchored at the unknown end.

995
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:25,980
And after some back and forth, your group decided that a single agent would follow the dirty rope as the rest of the squad, still led by Stump,

996
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:32,980
would follow within sight and off to the side a bit as to not all walk the same path as the missing crewman.

997
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:33,980
It's a rope!

998
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,980
Wait, follow the dirty rope into the bog?

999
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:37,980
That's right.

1000
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:38,980
Oh wow.

1001
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:45,980
And your guys' team drew straws. Basically what we're doing here, you guys are going to play your characters in a second,

1002
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:55,980
but we're doing a flashback and so I'm doing a lot of like explaining what happened leading up to where we're going to kick off and then we'll dive in.

1003
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,980
Oh no man, I'm all about the rope talk.

1004
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:00,980
Yeah. Can you describe it even more?

1005
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:07,980
Now this here is natural. A lot of people think that rope does just pop up and ball from time to time. This is not natural. This is an unknown rope.

1006
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:11,980
It's strangely fibrous. Does anyone have biology?

1007
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:19,980
How could a rope be strangely fibrous? They're so fibrous.

1008
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:27,980
It's strangely fibrous if anyone is adept with, if anyone has a knowledge of rope.

1009
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,980
I actually have that written down here.

1010
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:30,980
Or any sort of biology.

1011
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:35,980
I gave myself craft improvised contraptions. Does this appear to be an improvised contraption?

1012
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:38,980
Hey, I'll answer that since you took it. It does not.

1013
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:39,980
Perfect.

1014
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:46,980
This entire group is making their way through kind of watching as Agent Lee drew the short straw.

1015
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:53,980
And he's the one who has to follow the rope through the bog as the rest of you are kind of behind off to the side following through.

1016
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:59,980
And it wasn't long before the job site behind you was completely obscured by the landscape.

1017
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:07,980
And it wasn't much longer until the path ahead of you all opened up and you found the missing construction workers.

1018
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:11,980
There must have been at least 40 of them.

1019
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:12,980
There must be at least 40 of them.

1020
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:14,980
Half buried upside down.

1021
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,980
Was 40 of them.

1022
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,980
In the soppingly saturated soil.

1023
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,980
Hey, Stump, is this normal?

1024
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,980
Strangely, in rows.

1025
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,980
Mud covered rubber boots pointing to heaven.

1026
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:27,980
Jeans below.

1027
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:30,980
Highlighter work vests just visible.

1028
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:35,980
The majority of their torsos fully down in the muck.

1029
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:41,980
Their arms and heads making up the root systems of these human beings planted like crops in a field.

1030
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,980
Silent.

1031
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:44,980
Undisturbed.

1032
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:46,980
Stagnant.

1033
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:50,980
And you smell something other than the dampened decay of the bog.

1034
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:53,980
Unsettling due to its lack of congruency with its setting.

1035
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:56,980
It's a delicate floral fragrance.

1036
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,980
And that's when Agent Lee screams.

1037
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:03,980
The rope in his hands is now emanating a bioluminescent glow.

1038
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:07,980
And he succeeds his role.

1039
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:11,980
So he is struggling as he's trying to keep this radiant potential gar-

1040
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:12,980
Garret?

1041
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:13,980
Garot?

1042
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:14,980
Garote?

1043
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:15,980
Garot?

1044
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:19,980
The rope that goes around your neck a noose of some sort from looping itself around his neck.

1045
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:26,980
And now we're going to jump in, in turn-based action, starting with whoever has the highest dexterity.

1046
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,980
Call him out! Who's got dexterity?

1047
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:30,980
I have 70.

1048
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:31,980
I have 60.

1049
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:32,980
60.

1050
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:33,980
Uh, 65.

1051
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:35,980
65. Stunt.

1052
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:36,980
55.

1053
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,980
55.

1054
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:45,980
Julius Summers, you are kicking things off. Remind us what you look like and how you react to this situation.

1055
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:56,980
Julius is, yeah, wearing full camo, got the rubber boots on, and he- this is pretty- this isn't, like, one of the worst things he's ever seen.

1056
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:06,980
But, uh, it's still not great, so he's gonna go and, like, just pick up one of the boots and just, like, see if there's anything in it.

1057
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:09,980
There's a foot in it. Who had 65 dexterity?

1058
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:10,980
Me.

1059
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:11,980
You're up.

1060
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:17,980
Mo Mo vomits all over the swamp.

1061
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:20,980
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. That's gross.

1062
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:21,980
Yeah.

1063
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,980
It's nasty. There was a foot in that boot. Who had- who had 60 dex?

1064
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:26,980
There's a foot in my boot.

1065
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:29,980
So the rope is attacking Agent Lee.

1066
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:44,980
Who's about, maybe, 20 feet away from you, and you've opened up yourselves, like, you've walked out into this sort of open, boggy field, uh, that this rope is coming out of, and this is the field in which all these humans are planted upside down, boots to heaven.

1067
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,980
How do we feel about Agent Lee? Do we like him?

1068
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:48,980
Do I care?

1069
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:52,980
He didn't have the sense to not dress like a man in black in the fucking bog.

1070
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:53,980
Seems uptight.

1071
00:58:53,980 --> 00:59:00,980
So, like, I guess what she would be wondering is, is this rope coming out the ground, like, where we are?

1072
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:11,980
Yeah, so, as you, uh, you can roll, um, a search, um, in order to see if, uh, if you can make out where it's, where it's coming from.

1073
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:13,980
Yeah, get those dice, we're gonna roll them!

1074
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:19,980
Okay, search, okay, not that bad. Uh, okay, D100s. Got it, got it, okay.

1075
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:22,980
Oh, that's a 9 under 40!

1076
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,980
Yay! Starting off good.

1077
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:32,980
Phoebe, you see this rope, and you see, you notice that the bioluminescence is, uh, is, is kind of, like, uh, following it,

1078
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:38,980
and, and the rope that's tying itself around his neck is kind of heading into the middle of where all these people are buried,

1079
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:47,980
and you see a slight glow kind of underneath the muck and the bog, and you can make out exactly where it's emanating from,

1080
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:51,980
and it's only about ten feet in front of you.

1081
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:55,980
I wish I had, like, a knife on me, because then I'd just try to chop the rope.

1082
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:57,980
Whoa, what's that in your back pocket?

1083
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:58,980
I feel like I'd have one.

1084
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:00,980
Why wouldn't you? It'd be nuts!

1085
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:03,980
I'd definitely have a sharp crystal in my bra, at least.

1086
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:11,980
Um, I want to try to, I feel like the, by default move, I'd want to go up and try to chop the rope, yeah.

1087
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,980
Go ahead and roll a melee weapons attack.

1088
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:20,980
Oh, no. Well, that's not the worst, either. But that's a bad roll. That's a 96 over 30.

1089
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,980
That's a critical failure.

1090
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:23,980
So, here's the thing-

1091
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:25,980
My iced coffee's still in my hand.

1092
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:31,980
Here's the thing, Kate. Um, we're children, and-

1093
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:33,980
No, we're very, very clever men.

1094
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:39,980
And so, 69 is the most critical success you can roll, and therefore-

1095
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:41,980
No, no, no, no, no, it's a 96. It was a 96.

1096
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,980
I know, therefore-

1097
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:44,980
But therefore-

1098
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:45,980
Oh, no!

1099
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:46,980
Yeah.

1100
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,980
No, no, I think that's what, uh, Glass Cannon does, also.

1101
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,980
Oh, no, it's 86 is the worst one, not 96.

1102
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:52,980
Oh, that's funny.

1103
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:53,980
That's funny.

1104
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:54,980
I think.

1105
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:55,980
I like that.

1106
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:56,980
Yeah.

1107
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:57,980
Kitchen humor.

1108
01:00:57,980 --> 01:00:58,980
We were just like, the opposite.

1109
01:00:58,980 --> 01:00:59,980
Yeah.

1110
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:04,980
We're like, not doing that.

1111
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:05,980
The worst.

1112
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:15,980
Alright, so, as you drop your iced coffee directly into the bog, a significant amount of bog water starts combining itself

1113
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:24,980
inside the open top of your iced coffee, and there is very little chance that you're gonna want to drink any of that.

1114
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:25,980
That is-

1115
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:28,980
That is the worst thing that could ever happen to me. Thank you for-

1116
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:31,980
I mean, don't- Wow, that was the worst.

1117
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:32,980
And as you trip forward-

1118
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:36,980
That's one of the most upsetting things I've heard described in our horror podcast.

1119
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:37,980
That was $7!

1120
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:41,980
Yeah, like, I had such a visceral reaction to that being ruined.

1121
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:44,980
I'm gonna be tired later.

1122
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:52,980
As you try to dive forward with your knife, the knife slips out of your hand and disappears into the bog.

1123
01:01:52,980 --> 01:02:02,980
You are on your hands and knees, about six inches deep in this thing, and kind of facing exactly where this bioluminescence is,

1124
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:08,980
and you might be the only one who can see that it is heading directly for you.

1125
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:11,980
Ooh, I yell, guys, look!

1126
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:12,980
Guys, look!

1127
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:17,980
Burl Summers is up next, and he heeds your advice, but he rolls a fail as well,

1128
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:23,980
and he jumps down with a machete in his hand and just kind of slaps it into the water,

1129
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:26,980
hacking at absolutely nothing in his attempt.

1130
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:32,980
His three whiskers coming off of his chin, blowing in the wind, and after him goes,

1131
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:34,980
Stumpy, Mr. Stumpman.

1132
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:35,980
Save us, Stump!

1133
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:39,980
Stump is pulling a heftier looking knife off of his belt.

1134
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:44,980
It was sheathed. He had it hanging on a sheath on the edge of his belt, and he pulls that out,

1135
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:50,980
and he wants to lunge, but he's gonna lunge for kind of that center point that it was heading towards.

1136
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:54,980
He wants to just dive and slam it down into there.

1137
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,980
He's trying to cause damage more than he's trying to cut.

1138
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:00,980
Okay, awesome. Go ahead and roll melee.

1139
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:06,980
Because Phoebe called out where it is, you don't have to take a negative, and his fingers are raised.

1140
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:07,980
What is happening?

1141
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:10,980
What do those raised fingers look like?

1142
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:11,980
The Twin Towers.

1143
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:14,980
An 11. That's a critical success.

1144
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:15,980
Take it all from the top.

1145
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:17,980
It was an 11! Whoa!

1146
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:19,980
That's a critical success!

1147
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:27,980
Oh shit, dude. Okay, as you dive in, your body dumps down.

1148
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:29,980
Basically, you've been standing on this bog, right?

1149
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:35,980
It's not that deep. Your feet only go so far into it, especially you floating atop of it like you have been.

1150
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:46,980
But as you dump, as you dump, as you stump in to the water, horizontally, knife out, just stabbing down,

1151
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:56,980
you plant it directly into something, and your body is actually completely underground as well.

1152
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:57,980
Underground meaning under the water.

1153
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:04,980
And as everyone sees your body kind of dip under the water, it's that idea of like,

1154
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:07,980
holy shit, there is a deeper part of the bog right there.

1155
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:17,980
And then suddenly, from out of the water, rising weightless is this figure, humanoid in tattered clothes,

1156
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:26,980
and you see that her hair was the rope that is heading off and still trying to take down Agent Lee.

1157
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:31,980
And your knife is buried directly in the top of her head.

1158
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:41,980
And she is singing, crying, laughing, all at the same time, and I need everyone to roll con to avoid.

1159
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:44,980
18, I pass.

1160
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:49,980
18 as well, I also pass.

1161
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:50,980
What?

1162
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:51,980
Hell yeah.

1163
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:52,980
Oh, it's real.

1164
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:53,980
Just under 68.

1165
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:54,980
Nice.

1166
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:55,980
Under 70.

1167
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:58,980
Well done. Okay, and stump, how'd you do?

1168
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:04,980
Stump's highest score is his constitution, and it's a 75, and he rolled an 89.

1169
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:05,980
That's not good.

1170
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:10,980
But it kind of makes sense, because he just kind of rodeoed this thing in the head and is hanging on.

1171
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:21,980
So the rest of you kind of see this, and Joe, Stump has his knife buried into the top of this creature's head,

1172
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:27,980
and it is laughing or crying or singing directly in your face,

1173
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:34,980
and the mud and muck across its face is slowly just starting to fall away,

1174
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:44,980
and you see the skin underneath is so thin and withered away that the bones are almost creaking through and out.

1175
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:50,980
It's been in the water for so long that it's disintegrating into nothingness,

1176
01:05:50,980 --> 01:06:00,980
and as you hear this noise in your head, these memories are unlocked, and we go immediately back to Stump back in the war.

1177
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,980
Please describe the worst thing you've ever done.

1178
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:06,980
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1179
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:07,980
Joe Terry.

1180
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:15,980
Stump was a sniper spotter in the war, and he got his nickname Stump because he would sit there for sometimes hours,

1181
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:23,980
stock still, just trying to line up a shot, and he'd been there for a while, and his sniper guy was getting restless.

1182
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,980
He was like, come on, Stump, you don't have to live up to your name all the time.

1183
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:33,980
And finally, it got to Stump, and he said, all right, firing line is six degrees north by northwest,

1184
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:39,980
line up the shot, give it a wind speed of 35, and go.

1185
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:42,980
And Stump knew that wasn't the right call.

1186
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:47,980
He wanted to wait a little bit longer, but he felt pressured, and yeah, it hit civilians.

1187
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:52,980
This bullet ripped through a bunch of people who were standing next to the thing he wanted to hit.

1188
01:06:52,980 --> 01:07:01,980
And as soon as you are replaying that in your mind, you see this entity, this creature that you're face to face with now,

1189
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:07,980
has supplanted itself inside of your memory, and it's watching you do this,

1190
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:17,980
and you are feeling its history of its land just being overtaken repeatedly, and repeatedly, and moved,

1191
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:24,980
and shuffled off to a different location, and its land being burned, and its family being exiled or murdered,

1192
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:33,980
and you feel the weight of what has been done to this creature in some semblance of a past life on your shoulders

1193
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:39,980
as you know that you did that to people overseas.

1194
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:49,980
And then the crying stops, and you fall back into the muck, make a splash as these tattered robes,

1195
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:59,980
these muddy sort of amorphous cloth and textiles kind of dissipates into mud and muck and bog.

1196
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:11,980
The thick braided hair that you can see loses its bioluminescent glow, and Burl Summers comes up and reaches out his hand to you.

1197
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:16,980
Son, I think I have a job for you.

1198
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:32,980
War!

1199
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:51,980
Destroy!

1200
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:55,980
Vacuous!

1201
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:58,980
Conquer!

1202
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:02,980
War!

1203
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,980
War!

1204
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:19,980
War!

1205
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:26,980
War!

1206
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:31,980
War!

1207
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:43,980
And then the camera shifts, and we see a little restaurant called Beer Eat A Taco.

1208
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:49,980
And the text across the bottom of the screen says, July 7th, 2022.

1209
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:51,980
Joke is just a linguistic mess.

1210
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:56,980
I think it might be the funniest one we've ever done.
