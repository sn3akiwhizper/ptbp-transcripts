0	6000	Salutations and hellos. It's your radio goddess, Wolf the Dog.
6000	15000	I host this little old show y'all may enjoy at the radio station known as 694.2 PTBP.
15000	21000	What do those numbers and letters stand for? I honestly have no idea.
21000	25000	I used a random number and letter generator to make it.
25000	31000	But what is not random is the intentional love y'all have sent our way.
31000	38000	This howlin' with Wolf is from Silvestri who tweeted about the show and tagged at PretendingPod on Twitter.
38000	46000	Which, don't even get old Wolfy started on that. I'll X a thread so fast you'll zuck your musk.
46000	49000	Anyway, tag us on the internet please.
49000	51000	Silvestri writes
80000	83000	to listen to all the bonus episodes.
83000	87000	Now who is this Zach people keep speaking of?
87000	90000	And why does he spell his name like that?
90000	93000	What's so special about him?
93000	97000	I don't know. Maybe one day I'll get to meet this Zach.
97000	99000	Probably not though, I'm uh, I'm pretty busy.
99000	102000	Anyway, thanks for writing in.
102000	107000	Next time if you could talk a little less about a Zach and a little more about a Wolf
107000	109000	that would be pretty nice of ya.
109000	112000	If you want to write up something for your wolf to how,
112000	116000	tag at PretendingPod on Instagram threads or Twitter.
116000	119000	Tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook.
119000	122000	Tag users slash PretendingToBePeople on Reddit.
122000	127000	Or write up a five star review on the podcast app of your choice.
127000	130000	And get it in front of these here eyes of mine.
130000	133000	Oh, my favorite podcast app?
133000	138000	For reviews, it's definitely the Apple Podcast app.
138000	144000	Writing out a five star review on Apple Podcast does wonders for us here at PTBP,
144000	152000	which hopefully will allow us to continue broadcasting these wondrously terrible stories from 694.2,
152000	156000	the city's oldest and only radio station.
156000	158000	Whoa, what's that?
159000	167000	You want to support the show financially in exchange for a wild amount of really dope fully edited bonus episodes?
167000	170000	The Patreon link is in the show notes.
170000	174000	You want a shirt or a hat or a fanny pack or a beach towel?
174000	177000	That's so fun, I love that for you.
177000	180000	The merch store link is in the show notes.
180000	186000	You want to see all the links I tirelessly typed up to all of our shit?
186000	190000	Fucking bet, babies, the links are in the show notes.
190000	196000	There, there, I know change is hard, but it's already time for the news.
196000	201000	Last time, on episode 33, that's not Brock,
201000	209000	Daddy ran away with the drone footage of the old timey gymnasium with the bloody throne under the basketball hoop.
209000	216000	So they decided to head to the foundry, both for a drink and to hopefully meet up with Dr. Brock Hargrave.
216000	225000	In the foundry's parking lot, Beck showed the team a clip of the Jaguar that jumped on the train over Godel's Gate to Grover's Gorge,
225000	230000	seemingly speaking as it slid down the side of the strange smooth chasm.
230000	238000	Inside the foundry, the can crew was approached by a ghastly gaunt woman who called herself Elijah.
238000	246000	It muttered about 836 under her breath while she openly discussed Dr. Hargrave and Dr. Murray
246000	251000	and her status as a cowboy before she attempted to smoke meth at the table.
251000	260000	Taking us now to the foundry where Stevie is feeding this Elijah woman Adderall so she doesn't smoke methamphetamine in public,
260000	263000	it just feels so right.
263000	268000	It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.
293000	295000	All my fault.
313000	315000	What's he building in there?
315000	317000	You know that song?
317000	319000	Chocolate of course.
320000	326000	It's like chocolate of course. Of course.
328000	330000	I'll buy us IMAX tickets for that one.
330000	334000	Oh gosh. Look how big the chocolate is.
338000	341000	I thought he was going to redo Chocolat.
341000	342000	That'd be better.
342000	343000	Timothy Chocolat.
343000	346000	What other Johnny Depp movies could he do?
347000	350000	If Timothée Chalamet played...
350000	351000	Rango?
355000	356000	That'd be crazy.
356000	359000	What was that movie? It was a book I think.
359000	360000	The Rum Diaries?
360000	362000	Fearing Loathing in Las Vegas.
362000	364000	Fearing Loathing in Las Vegas?
364000	367000	Dude, but Timothée Chalamet in Leaving Las Vegas?
367000	369000	Do you think he could do it?
369000	370000	Do you think he could do it?
370000	371000	He could do a pretty good job at it.
371000	374000	After seeing the trailer to Wonka, you think that he could do it?
374000	379000	Yeah, I think it's not him being bad as the movie is bad.
379000	383000	You know what? No shit. He would be a great What's Eating Gilbert Grape.
383000	385000	Yeah. The mom.
388000	389000	Or the grape.
389000	390000	The grape.
390000	392000	Being grape of course.
392000	394000	Tell us what you're doing over there.
396000	401000	From now on, when I think Timothée Chalamet, it'll be verbing of course.
401000	403000	Peabody Award.
408000	410000	I think that's kind of how you say it.
410000	411000	Peabody?
411000	412000	Peabody.
412000	413000	Nah, say it in a British accent.
413000	414000	Peabody Award.
414000	416000	The Peabody Award.
417000	418000	Sorry dude.
418000	419000	Were you just saying it in a British accent?
419000	423000	You guys are saying body so hard which is not how anybody says it.
423000	424000	Peabody.
424000	425000	Peabody.
425000	426000	Peabody.
426000	427000	Peabody.
427000	428000	Peabody. I think it's Peabody.
428000	429000	Peabody.
429000	430000	Peabody.
430000	431000	Peabody Award.
431000	432000	Peabody.
432000	433000	Peabody Award.
433000	434000	This is the Peabody.
434000	436000	The first annual Peabody's.
436000	443000	For highest score on the turfs, has Cal won a Peabody Award?
443000	444000	Yeah, for sure.
444000	445000	A what?
445000	447000	A Peabody Award?
447000	448000	Peabody?
448000	449000	Peabody?
449000	450000	Peabody?
450000	451000	Peabody.
451000	457000	There were a couple websites that awarded him a Peabody Award but he wasn't really aware
457000	458000	of that.
458000	459000	Was he deserving?
460000	464000	I think it was more of a wish, like a wish that like buddies we'd like to pee with.
464000	465000	Oh, okay.
465000	466000	Yeah.
466000	467000	A hundred percent.
467000	468000	But he's also won a Peabody.
468000	469000	Yeah.
469000	473000	It's like comedians in cars but it's journalists in bathrooms.
473000	478000	We're gonna go check out this restaurant and spend a whole lot of time in their bathroom.
478000	481000	And it's carpool karaoke so they sing in there too.
481000	484000	A stall to stall interview.
484000	485000	Yeah, interview.
485000	488000	You know what Julius has been talking to us about in the van?
488000	489000	Pitching.
491000	495000	But like the thing is, you know, like on Hot Ones, they have to eat the wings.
495000	497000	You have to take a shit during the interview.
500000	504000	If you can't take a shit, they send a camera up there and find out what's going on.
504000	508000	And like everyone in the comments like makes fun of you for like not taking and picking
508000	509000	up shit.
509000	512000	Dude, it's like we call it talking shit.
512000	513000	Shit talking.
513000	514000	Shit talking.
515000	516000	Taking the piss.
516000	518000	Lord took a shit like nobody else, dude.
521000	524000	Who would the best shitter be, do you think?
524000	527000	What a weird joke.
527000	531000	That's somebody who's watched a lot of Hot Ones.
531000	536000	I think there would be different groups of fans who would want to see different kinds
536000	537000	of shit.
537000	539000	Because like best shit is pretty subjective.
539000	541000	Does it show the shit after they did it?
541000	546000	Oh yeah, there's a camera down there watching the shit go in.
546000	550000	And so you're like, yeah, no ass, just shit.
550000	552000	It's a perpendicular.
552000	553000	Yeah.
554000	555000	Did you see?
555000	556000	It's tasteful, okay?
556000	557000	It's tasteful.
557000	563000	But some people like, I think if it's a more spectacular splash, that might do it for some
563000	564000	people.
564000	567000	But you'll see a lot of people in the comment going like, eat fiber scrub.
568000	574000	I personally would be more impressed by how much of a solid log can you get out before
574000	575000	it has to get pinched off?
575000	580000	Like how much of just a smoothie assembly line are you?
580000	583000	Because at that point you're showing off your sphincter.
583000	584000	Yeah.
584000	585000	No, no, no, no, no.
585000	586000	It's only a poop cam.
586000	587000	No ass cam.
587000	588000	No, no, no, no.
588000	592000	I didn't mean, you're saying the power thereof to not cut it off.
593000	594000	Right.
594000	595000	Yeah.
595000	596000	Full relaxation.
596000	601000	Do you think we've lost some listeners?
601000	602000	Yeah.
602000	604000	Did you see Obama went on talking shit?
604000	606000	They're getting big names, dude.
606000	607000	Oh my God.
607000	608000	So smooth.
608000	611000	I would choose George Bush though for that conversation.
611000	612000	H.W. or W?
612000	613000	W.
613000	614000	W.
614000	616000	I paint little Iraqi children.
616000	618000	Oh, that's the Onion article.
618000	623000	He's shitting and painting and interviewing and it's honestly, it's pretty cool.
623000	628000	He talks about how he did 9-11.
628000	631000	He's so, he's so plain and fast and loose in there.
631000	635000	The scoops they get on talking shit.
635000	636000	Yeah.
636000	638000	I wasn't like totally, I didn't totally know about it.
638000	642000	I just, you know, I knew it was happening.
642000	646000	If we decide that talking shit doesn't work for the intro, what could we pivot to here
646000	647000	roughly?
647000	650000	I think it's pretty good shit.
650000	651000	Yeah.
651000	657000	And we're finished with it now and now we're starting episode 34 pretending to be people.
657000	658000	Welcome.
658000	663000	The island of Dr. Insano.
663000	669000	We have been learning some things and we are at the foundry and we are around a table.
669000	672000	I feel like we've got a bunch more about to be learned.
672000	677000	It shows, it's like you just unpaused it and it's Julius saying rock.
677000	678000	I tell you what.
678000	679000	Okay.
679000	680000	All right.
680000	681000	Calm down.
681000	682000	Calm down.
682000	684000	So it was Elijah, right?
684000	685000	Can I call you Elijah?
685000	686000	That's right.
686000	688000	You can call me Ruth for sure.
688000	689000	Or wait, sorry.
689000	690000	What?
690000	691000	Ruth.
691000	692000	Okay.
692000	693000	I'll call you Ruth.
693000	694000	Whatever you want.
694000	695000	Yes.
695000	696000	What made you want to meet with us?
696000	697000	I forgot to ask you.
697000	699000	I was going to ask you what you thought of Dr. Murray.
699000	701000	You must've gotten a, how do you know?
701000	702000	She's good.
702000	703000	She's a doctor.
703000	705000	They're all kind of like that.
705000	710000	But like personality wise, what do you, what do you think about her?
710000	711000	Well, it doesn't really matter.
711000	713000	We're talking about one doctor, you know?
713000	718000	No, just like whether or not she's a disciplined and good person.
718000	721000	I mean, she helped us.
721000	725000	Do you think you're a disciplined and good person?
725000	728000	She growls as she looks across the table.
728000	730000	You were about to go smoke meth.
730000	731000	Smoke meth.
731000	734000	I do what needs to be done for this country.
734000	736000	Are you willing to do the same?
739000	740000	Meth?
750000	752000	Just, I just have to stop it.
752000	753000	He got caught.
753000	754000	He got caught.
754000	755000	He got caught.
755000	756000	He got caught.
757000	759000	It's just, it's going to get everyone, you know?
759000	766000	Cause we're all just considered as sheep to be slaughtered at this point, you know?
766000	768000	So it is, it's fine.
768000	770000	He got caught by the 836.
770000	771000	He got caught by the 836.
771000	772000	What does that mean?
772000	773000	What is the 836?
773000	779000	I don't, I don't know exactly, but I did know that if water is measured in cubic feet and
779000	783000	it's built in units of a hundred cubic feet, okay?
783000	787000	A hundred cubic feet, HCF, HCF, 836.
787000	789000	It's, it's holy cow farms.
789000	793000	It's, it's the eighth letter of the alphabet, the third letter of the alphabet, and the
793000	795000	sixth letter of the alphabet, HCF.
795000	796000	The milk place?
796000	803000	Which is equal, yes, to 748 gallons of water or milk, thank you.
803000	806000	And if you start at eight, 748 gallons, right?
806000	810600	So if you start at eight, go backwards and you have a four minus one is three and a seven
810600	816800	minus one is six, uh, 836 and if you take both of those negative ones together and the
816800	822100	minus cancel out and then you get plus 11, which if you do that eight times to the original
822100	832340	number of 748, you get Butter Cook.
832340	836040	Say it with me, 836.
836040	837040	That's right.
837040	838600	She points at Julius again.
838600	840600	Wait, 11 times 748?
840600	842600	Yeah, that last part I don't think had to have come.
842600	843600	That didn't work.
843600	846600	No, you multiply the 11 times 8 and add it.
846600	847600	What's your name?
847600	848600	Julius.
848600	850600	Julius knows what I'm talking about.
850600	851600	Okay.
851600	852600	She's making a lot of sense.
852600	853600	Yeah.
853600	855600	It sounds like you've got this all figured out.
855600	859600	I mean, you were talking earlier about something wild.
859600	862600	I mean, it sounds like you saw something wild too.
862600	866600	I just saw a dead man, a pair of legs of a man named Jimmy Corrigan.
866600	869600	Like that stupid comic book?
869600	871600	I don't know nothing about it.
871600	873600	My daughter, she made me read it.
873600	874600	It's very sad.
874600	877600	So who, do you guys know who Jimmy Corrigan is?
877600	878600	No.
878600	879600	What?
879600	882600	He's an American patriot who lost his top half.
882600	884600	At the same time as Brock?
884600	885600	Yes, lost his life.
885600	887600	How did Brock know him?
887600	893600	I may have sent Jimmy to go looking for...
893600	902600	And at that moment you see all the TVs in the foundry all cut to CNN for breaking news.
902600	907600	Pan News Network.
907600	912600	9-11-2.
912600	919600	Finally you see all the TVs flashing breaking news across the bottom of each of the screens
919600	924600	and your eyes inadvertently go to the screen showing can.
924600	928600	Julius is saying, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.
928600	935600	And a seemingly rushed Isabella Caya is kind of getting herself together as the camera
935600	941600	goes live on her and she says, yeah, yeah, yes, yes, yes, yes, hello.
941600	951600	To everyone in the city, I do have some heartbreaking news for you.
951600	957600	American tycoon, Fred Godel is dead.
957600	959600	Cal looks over at Stevie.
959600	969600	Stevie is stunned, shocked, mouth slightly ajar with like amazement, astonishment, confusion.
969600	975600	Maybe, maybe some of your brother still is in there.
975600	983600	My, my, it's like their ears are just like ringing and they're just looking down and
983600	990600	they started kind of stumbling up from their chair and walk across the foundry to the bathroom.
990600	992600	Do you think it got old?
992600	994600	Hey, Maggie, can you turn that up?
994600	1002600	We are, um, just now getting word that Godel company has put out a statement about the
1002600	1009600	passing of Fred Godel Monday night.
1009600	1011600	That's counting on his fingers.
1011600	1012600	Just told his notes.
1012600	1014600	They're going to find out how many days this was.
1014600	1020600	Yesterday was Thursday, Monday, July 4th, 2022.
1020600	1031600	And at that moment, each of you starts thinking to yourself, Oh my God, did I miss the 4th of July?
1031600	1035600	You saw Fred Godel after that.
1035600	1039600	He was at a gas station on the road as we were departing Godel's gorge.
1039600	1041600	Shit.
1041600	1043600	Wait, who realizes it?
1043600	1045600	All of us at the same time.
1045600	1046600	Wait a minute.
1046600	1049600	Are you guys thinking what I'm thinking?
1049600	1051600	Say it all together now.
1051600	1059600	We saw Fred Godel after he left.
1059600	1061600	After he's supposed to have died.
1061600	1063600	So he couldn't be dead.
1063600	1064600	He's not dead?
1064600	1065600	He's not dead, Stevie.
1065600	1066600	Wait.
1066600	1067600	No, that's Elijah.
1067600	1068600	I'm not Stevie.
1068600	1070600	You guys, dude, he sounds kind of similar.
1070600	1072600	I thought Stevie had come back.
1072600	1073600	I do go by many names.
1073600	1075600	Julius, yell at Stevie again.
1075600	1076600	Stevie!
1076600	1078600	Stevie, Stevie, come back.
1078600	1079600	He's not dead.
1079600	1081600	We probably have to kill him.
1081600	1085600	Or at least capture him.
1085600	1086600	Contain.
1086600	1087600	Maim.
1087600	1090600	It's like good news, bad news sort of for everything in general for you.
1090600	1095600	Yeah, I know they probably felt a lot of complicated feelings when you heard about the death of
1095600	1096600	your father.
1096600	1099600	I know I sure did, but he's not really dead.
1099600	1101600	You still have to kill him.
1101600	1102600	Your mission is not finished.
1102600	1107600	You don't need to process stuff now, but later you will for sure.
1107600	1109600	This is like a good practice for that.
1109600	1114600	Hey, Ruth, cover your ears.
1114600	1116600	No.
1116600	1118600	Fuck.
1118600	1123600	I don't have any money.
1123600	1128600	As he reaches out to me.
1128600	1130600	She goes, do you have a vape on you?
1130600	1132600	Do we need anything else from her?
1132600	1133600	I mean, I feel like we need a lot of stuff.
1133600	1135600	What is your deal, dude?
1136600	1138600	Are you here to get to the bottom of this?
1138600	1139600	Yes.
1139600	1140600	We want to find out the truth.
1140600	1141600	We're the news.
1141600	1142600	Ruth.
1142600	1143600	Oh, nice.
1143600	1144600	Cal, good one.
1144600	1145600	Thank you.
1145600	1146600	You can't deny the dog.
1146600	1147600	You can't deny the dog.
1147600	1148600	Not as good.
1148600	1149600	There.
1149600	1150600	You can't deny the rhyme.
1150600	1156600	She's looking at you, Cal, with one eye and the other one is searching your chin, your
1156600	1157600	mouth.
1158600	1164600	Yeah, he's got the same sort of facial situation as you.
1164600	1166600	Who's that, then?
1166600	1171600	Does this person literally have independent motion of eyes?
1171600	1174600	Or is that just a fun way to describe the way Googly-
1174600	1176600	It's just a fun way to describe her disability.
1176600	1177600	You're not fucking sure.
1177600	1179600	I nudge Julius.
1179600	1182600	Julius, remember that joke about being a chameleon?
1182600	1184600	Look at those eyes.
1184600	1186600	We're talking about animal people and shit.
1186600	1188600	What do chameleons like to eat?
1188600	1190600	Oh, like flies, right?
1190600	1191600	Bugs.
1191600	1192600	Yeah.
1192600	1193600	There sure are a lot of bugs in here.
1193600	1194600	Have you noticed that?
1194600	1195600	A lot of bar flies.
1195600	1197600	A lot of bar flies.
1197600	1198600	Guys, shut up.
1198600	1199600	What do you think about the bugs in here?
1199600	1204600	Okay, let me just step away from the game real quick and ask you a question about how
1204600	1206600	you want season two to go.
1210600	1211600	Yeah.
1211600	1213600	We wanted to be a chameleon lady.
1217600	1218600	Duh.
1219600	1221600	We want chameleon, of course.
1225600	1226600	The whole time.
1230600	1231600	In both arcs.
1231600	1238600	All I'm saying is that my house address is 8 Oak Avenue.
1238600	1245600	8 is the first number, and Oak is three letters, and Avenue is also three letters, or six letters.
1245600	1246600	So that's 836.
1246600	1249600	And also, them, what are they calling them?
1249600	1250600	Lightning tornadoes?
1250600	1252600	They're leaving those smooth holes in the ground everywhere?
1252600	1253600	Yeah, what about them?
1253600	1258600	They're occurring at the exact opposite side of the world every four hours and 18 minutes
1258600	1259600	from when they hit.
1259600	1261600	And what's the circumference of one of those circles?
1261600	1262600	Hitting another random location.
1262600	1265600	Actually, I think that might be it.
1265600	1271600	Two minutes and nine seconds later, or maybe those seconds add up to some sort of time
1271600	1272600	unit that's 836.
1272600	1273600	836.
1273600	1276600	I wrote it down for a reason, but it's another one of my 836.
1276600	1277600	836.
1277600	1278600	Is that your house?
1278600	1279600	836.
1279600	1280600	Yeah, 836.
1280600	1281600	What?
1281600	1282600	Is that your house?
1282600	1283600	It's just 836.
1283600	1284600	What?
1284600	1285600	This is at your house?
1285600	1286600	836.
1286600	1287600	What?
1287600	1288600	You wrote this down.
1288600	1289600	Yeah.
1289600	1290600	That's at your house.
1290600	1291600	836.
1291600	1292600	What?
1292600	1293600	Do you have it in an email or something?
1293600	1294600	Could you just forward that to us?
1294600	1295600	Do you fax?
1295600	1296600	I love to fax.
1297600	1299600	Thomas' eyes lit up.
1299600	1301600	Oh my God.
1301600	1303600	He's so happy.
1303600	1307600	Thomas is so in character.
1307600	1310600	Count like four.
1310600	1312600	It starts to write down the...
1312600	1313600	What do you think?
1313600	1314600	Oh, yeah.
1314600	1317600	Let me give you the can, the fax number, okay?
1317600	1318600	Okay.
1318600	1319600	It's 836.
1319600	1321600	Son of a bitch.
1321600	1322600	Look at that.
1322600	1323600	It's everywhere.
1323600	1324600	Look at that.
1324600	1325600	Look at that.
1325600	1326600	It's everywhere.
1326600	1327600	Look at that.
1327600	1328600	Look at that.
1328600	1330600	So it's the area code for the city.
1330600	1331600	That's all it is?
1331600	1333600	All our phone numbers start with 836.
1333600	1335600	Yeah, but is it more?
1335600	1336600	Hey, Maggie.
1336600	1339600	How much is old fashioned with tax?
1339600	1340600	Why do you want to know?
1340600	1342600	It's like seven something maybe.
1342600	1343600	Fuck.
1343600	1344600	Oh, close.
1344600	1345600	It was close.
1345600	1346600	And then she punches it in.
1346600	1348600	After tax, it's 836.
1348600	1350600	Holy shit.
1350600	1351600	What is this?
1351600	1353600	The fucking Truman Show?
1353600	1355600	We do always have a camera on us.
1355600	1358600	Everybody roll grip.
1364600	1365600	Yeah, that's a failure.
1365600	1366600	I fail.
1366600	1367600	I fail as well.
1367600	1368600	Well, perfect.
1368600	1371600	Then we get a little group madness here.
1371600	1377600	Why don't you tell us exactly what the fuck is going on here, chameleon lady?
1377600	1379600	She never answered the fly question.
1379600	1382600	You eat flies, don't you?
1382600	1384600	And Stevie walks out of the bathroom.
1384600	1385600	He's not dead.
1385600	1386600	Your dad's not dead.
1386600	1387600	You still have to kill him.
1387600	1391600	This woman's a fucking chameleon.
1391600	1393600	She stands up and backs away.
1393600	1395600	And she's like, I'm not a chameleon.
1395600	1397600	I'm not a chameleon.
1397600	1403600	My mouth is dry from the amphetamines or whatever I was given by your friend.
1403600	1408600	And I'm not a chameleon.
1408600	1410600	Okay, Stevie.
1410600	1412600	She may or may not be a chameleon.
1412600	1413600	Yeah?
1413600	1415600	Wait, did you say my dad's not dead?
1415600	1416600	Your dad's not dead, Stevie.
1416600	1417600	We saw him.
1417600	1419600	We saw him after he was supposed to have died.
1419600	1420600	On the way back from the gorge.
1420600	1421600	At the gas station.
1421600	1422600	At the gas station.
1422600	1423600	Wait, when did they say he died?
1423600	1424600	That doesn't mean-
1424600	1425600	July 4th.
1425600	1426600	Okay.
1426600	1428600	8 minus 3 is 6.
1441600	1452600	Okay, just because they said that he died on a different day doesn't mean he's not dead.
1452600	1454600	But that is good, I guess.
1454600	1455600	What's his birthday?
1455600	1457600	I think we already did this bit.
1457600	1460600	Because I said August 36th.
1460600	1461600	Perfect.
1461600	1462600	Fuck.
1464600	1465600	It's coming up everywhere.
1465600	1468600	Zach, I need to know how much sand I lost.
1468600	1469600	Yeah.
1469600	1471600	By the way, you all just lose one grip for that.
1471600	1472600	That's what, yeah.
1472600	1473600	I'm sorry.
1473600	1474600	How dare you apologize.
1474600	1476600	That hits me right smack onto my breaking point.
1476600	1478600	Do you break then?
1478600	1481600	Oh, that's fortuitous.
1481600	1484600	I mean, Luke and Thomas can leave the room if they want, but I think we all know what
1484600	1485600	your mania's gonna be.
1485600	1486600	Oh, yeah.
1486600	1491600	He's got the numbers in him.
1491600	1493600	Life is a circle.
1493600	1496600	Becky's got the numbers in him.
1496600	1498600	Oh, boy.
1498600	1501600	Is it so it's not a phobia, it's a mania?
1501600	1503600	Oh, I guess that's up to you.
1503600	1506600	You can do whichever one you want and you don't have to tell any of us.
1506600	1507600	You can just do it.
1507600	1508600	Okay.
1508600	1509600	I bet we'll figure it out real quick.
1509600	1510600	Real quick.
1510600	1512600	It's either ah or ooh.
1512600	1516600	What do you guys think it's gonna be?
1516600	1518600	Oh, I think it's gonna be ooh.
1518600	1520600	I think it's gonna be ooh.
1520600	1521600	Interesting.
1521600	1522600	Maggie, Maggie.
1522600	1524600	Are you just fucking with us?
1524600	1525600	About what?
1525600	1526600	The price.
1526600	1527600	Yeah.
1528600	1532600	Well, at least that didn't do any serious mental damage.
1536600	1539600	And a joke that does no harm is all good.
1539600	1541600	All on fun, right, Beck?
1541600	1547600	Yeah, I mean, if it was actually fucking with us, it could have been 836.
1547600	1550600	In fact, I bet it fucking was 836.
1550600	1552600	That's what I'm talking about.
1552600	1553600	Yeah, right there.
1553600	1554600	That fire.
1554600	1555600	You ready to join up?
1555600	1556600	You ready to do this?
1559600	1560600	Octopus.
1560600	1561600	Tripod.
1561600	1562600	Spider.
1562600	1563600	Yes.
1563600	1564600	Holy shit!
1564600	1565600	Yep.
1565600	1566600	Holy shit!
1566600	1567600	Yep.
1567600	1568600	What's it mean?
1568600	1569600	That's exactly right.
1569600	1570600	Spiders have...
1570600	1571600	I'm talking like you now.
1571600	1573600	It's hard not to hear.
1573600	1574600	It's a fun voice.
1574600	1575600	Spiders have eight legs.
1575600	1576600	Oh, phew.
1576600	1577600	That's 838.
1577600	1578600	Okay.
1578600	1580600	But most insects have six legs.
1580600	1581600	Oh shit!
1581600	1582600	Ah!
1584600	1585600	Holy shit!
1585600	1586600	Almost any bug.
1586600	1588600	Anything you'd consider a bug, really.
1588600	1589600	It's everywhere.
1589600	1590600	It's all around us.
1590600	1598600	Julius is going to text X, do we know Ruth slash Elijah, and like snap a pic.
1598600	1600600	Like kind of like just above the table.
1600600	1603600	It flashes and like...
1603600	1606600	Yeah, roll stealth.
1606600	1609600	Ooh, 42 and a 40.
1609600	1610600	What was that?
1610600	1611600	Why'd you do that?
1611600	1612600	Oops.
1612600	1613600	And he hits it.
1614600	1615600	Oops.
1615600	1616600	Give me that phone.
1616600	1617600	No way.
1617600	1618600	Give me that.
1618600	1619600	Give me that.
1619600	1627600	Yeah, he's going to defend himself harder than he needs to.
1627600	1631600	Okay, 54 on a 60.
1631600	1636600	No, 79 on a 70.
1636600	1639600	She rips away your phone from you and...
1639600	1642600	He pulls his gun out and points it at her.
1642600	1643600	All right, everybody.
1643600	1644600	Calm down.
1644600	1645600	Uh oh.
1645600	1646600	Uh oh.
1646600	1647600	Hey.
1647600	1648600	Give me back my phone or I'll fucking kill you.
1648600	1650600	Uh, Beck is kind of looking around.
1650600	1652600	We're just doing a play.
1652600	1653600	We're just acting out a play.
1653600	1659600	Maggie rings the bell and says, hey, put that fucking gun down.
1659600	1662600	Yeah, Julius, don't pull a gun in Maggie's bar and hey, you know, if you want our friend
1662600	1667600	Stevie to give you some more of their Adderall, maybe you should give Julius his phone back.
1667600	1672600	He like slowly starts to lower the gun but is like reaching his hand out, like expecting
1672600	1674600	her to meet with the phone.
1674600	1678600	What is the number for X listed in your phone?
1678600	1683600	It's under Diggory, not X because no one actually calls her X.
1683600	1686600	That is the X-Files, right?
1686600	1688600	Right.
1688600	1691600	She scolded her.
1691600	1692600	Barely knew her.
1692600	1696600	Um, it's under Diggory because that's how he was introduced.
1696600	1701600	As she hands the phone back to you, she like turns it facing herself.
1701600	1703600	So she's like looking at the text.
1703600	1706600	Julius grabs it as quick as he can out of her hand.
1706600	1708600	Huh.
1708600	1711600	She's got one eye on you and the other eye on you.
1711600	1712600	Guys, we need to go.
1712600	1714600	Julius starts heading towards the door.
1714600	1715600	But it's our news bar.
1715600	1716600	She should go.
1716600	1718600	As Julius is walking away.
1718600	1721600	Julius is also texting X, uh, she knows.
1721600	1730600	She's hollering at him and she says, uh, it's a big world, Julius.
1730600	1731600	Fuck.
1731600	1733600	Which side are you on?
1733600	1735600	Julius leaves the foundry.
1735600	1740600	As Beck is leaving, he wants to say, and uh, you got Cal's fax number.
1740600	1743600	I'd love to see some of that information on the 836 you've gathered.
1743600	1753600	Yes, we are the sheep, but if we all are aware of the machine that is doing the slaughtering,
1753600	1756600	can we not rise?
1756600	1758600	Can you?
1758600	1761600	Maybe.
1761600	1762600	Hmm.
1762600	1763600	You want to be the sheep.
1763600	1765600	I'm confused.
1765600	1766600	We can rise.
1766600	1767600	Can sheep go upstairs?
1767600	1769600	How many more than cows?
1769600	1770600	I think they can't look up.
1770600	1771600	Is that right?
1771600	1773600	Texas dogs can't look up.
1773600	1777600	How many, uh, how many more of them pills you got there?
1777600	1782600	Stevie Cal gets between Stevie and uh, and Ruth.
1782600	1784600	Now we're just going to back away.
1784600	1791600	Stevie's going to lay down one more 10 milligram instant release Adderall right there, right there on the floor.
1791600	1793600	And we're all just going to back away.
1793600	1796600	And you're going to pick that up and you're going to leave Maggie's bar.
1796600	1798600	We're going to leave it too.
1798600	1802600	And then you can have your little X-Files war or whatever. I don't know.
1802600	1811600	And as you slowly start backing away, she reaches down slowly, keeping eye on you.
1811600	1814600	Both picks up the pill.
1814600	1821600	And as you leave, I think you guys are probably at the parking lot and you see her leave.
1821600	1822600	Bye, Ruth.
1822600	1823600	Like in her car?
1823600	1824600	No, leave the bar.
1824600	1827600	Oh.
1827600	1831600	She waves.
1831600	1833600	Guys, it's Ruth.
1833600	1837600	Julius is like pacing back and forth and like just looking at his phone waiting for a response.
1837600	1839600	She has some really good ideas about things.
1839600	1843600	Julius, can you tell us what the fuck is going on with your little cowboy club or whatever?
1843600	1848600	Yeah, I'll tell you in a little bit, but it's imperative that she does not know where we're going.
1848600	1853600	We didn't tell her about the footage that we have. She cannot know about that.
1853600	1854600	They don't want it out.
1854600	1855600	Who's, who's?
1855600	1857600	She's the bad guys. I'm the good guys.
1857600	1860600	Who's in charge and who's rebelling?
1860600	1865600	There's a lot of details. I know what Diggory tells me and what-
1865600	1866600	You don't-
1866600	1867600	Diggory?
1867600	1870600	You don't know, you don't know who's, you don't know who's anything.
1870600	1876600	I know that it exists and I know that you just, you follow orders and that's, that's what I know.
1876600	1878600	It's what I've known for years.
1878600	1881600	Do you know who those cowboys she mentioned are?
1881600	1883600	He does two thumbs to himself.
1883600	1884600	Oh, you're a cowboy?
1884600	1885600	Yeehaw.
1885600	1888600	But she thinks they're the cowboys. You're all cowboys?
1888600	1891600	She thinks that Dr. Murray is no longer a cowboy, right?
1891600	1896600	He doesn't do two thumbs to himself. He does two fingers over to Ruth.
1903600	1905600	And you're Diggory?
1905600	1906600	X.
1906600	1907600	X.
1907600	1910600	Here's what I know. I take orders from her now.
1910600	1916600	Before that, I took orders from someone else since I was a teen.
1916600	1920600	That's all I've done and I never questioned it. I never needed to.
1920600	1924600	I just knew you do what they tell you and you're going to be okay.
1924600	1928600	And you get to find out so much.
1928600	1931600	You get to find out so much.
1931600	1934600	Cow like puts his hands on your shoulders and he says,
1934600	1937600	Yeah, but you see, you're a can man now.
1937600	1943600	You take your orders from me. We're the ones who find out so much.
1943600	1946600	You've got to admit, we've been finding out a lot.
1946600	1950600	Julius just about loses his mind, like...
1950600	1953600	Come with us, son. We'll tell you what to do.
1953600	1957600	Okay, I've got to tell you everything just so that like...
1957600	1958600	We're all on the same page.
1958600	1965600	Yeah, because if I just go with you guys, it's not going to be safe for any of us.
1965600	1968600	Okay, why don't you tell us what you know?
1968600	1975600	Well, when, you know, when I was 16, I got taken into the firm and...
1975600	1977600	By that scary guy, right? That you told us about?
1977600	1979600	Oh shit, she's still here. Oh, sorry, Stevie.
1979600	1984600	No, yeah, it's me. I have a much gravelier and like upper register voice.
1984600	1987600	I thought it was Ruth, too.
1987600	1991600	Whereas the other ones, less gravelly and lower and a little southern.
1991600	1994600	But I'll try to change them even more in the future.
1994600	1995600	What did they say?
1995600	1998600	No, they're distinct. It's just...
1998600	2001600	You were taken by the firm when you were 16?
2001600	2007600	Yeah, I got... Well, initially I got taken, but yeah, I like joined up with them and...
2007600	2013600	I mean, literally since I was 16, I've been doing this like 13 years. I've fallen the orders.
2013600	2015600	Wait, what's the wildest thing you've ever done?
2015600	2018600	Yeah, what's the wackiest thing you've done for these guys?
2018600	2020600	Well, I'll tell you wacky.
2020600	2022600	Wild, too. And then Beck, what do you want to...
2022600	2027600	Scary. Just like real quick, you know, just like super easy.
2027600	2030600	Come up with three really complicated things for us.
2030600	2031600	Well, like...
2031600	2032600	Whole new stories.
2032600	2041600	My old handler and I, we had to like dig up a whole graveyard of people to like inspect them to make sure...
2041600	2044600	So that's the wacky one.
2044600	2051600	Well, and then like the cops came because someone saw us digging up every single body we dug up.
2051600	2055600	Well, scariest was when the cops showed up and there was like 10 of them.
2055600	2060600	And then I guess like the worst thing was after me and my handler killed all 10 of them.
2060600	2067600	And then we had to bury all the bodies plus 10 more back after we looked at all the dead bodies.
2067600	2072600	And we didn't even find what we were looking for. So it sucked, too. So that's your answer.
2072600	2074600	Whoa. Knocked out all three in one.
2074600	2076600	Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
2076600	2081600	Although after that, like it was not hard to kill any more people. It was not hard at all.
2081600	2083600	I imagine it wasn't.
2083600	2085600	It was kind of fun sometimes.
2085600	2086600	Oh, no.
2086600	2088600	Okay. Yeah.
2088600	2089600	You got to...
2089600	2090600	Not every time.
2090600	2097600	When you share a newsman with a van, you need to know his deepest secrets and now you do.
2097600	2101600	You share a newsman with a van?
2102600	2103600	Luke, do you have luck?
2103600	2104600	No.
2104600	2105600	Yeah, you do.
2105600	2106600	Oh, hell yeah.
2106600	2107600	Good job.
2107600	2108600	Nice.
2108600	2109600	Yeah, that was awesome.
2109600	2116600	All of that to like say, I know that the shit that I got told to do was almost always dangerous.
2116600	2124600	Someone almost always got hurt. And the people above the person above me, there's a person above them.
2124600	2127600	And it just gets worse the higher up you go.
2127600	2135600	And if we piss them off, it's not going to be good. And we're already, we don't agree on how to run things or they don't.
2135600	2139600	And so they're going to be dangerous now.
2139600	2141600	Which side has more power, yours or theirs?
2141600	2143600	I mean, it's hard to say, but theirs.
2143600	2147600	No, it's hard to say. It's hard to say, but ours.
2149600	2151600	That seems harder.
2151600	2153600	Like the non-messed out ones?
2153600	2155600	Well, they're not all met well.
2157600	2159600	And he thinks, yeah.
2161600	2162600	Wow.
2162600	2163600	Son of a bitch.
2163600	2171600	But here's the deal, like the footage that we have, my team, we want to show it. We need to get it out there. Their team?
2171600	2173600	Wants to put the kibosh on it.
2173600	2174600	Exactly.
2174600	2175600	So we're leaning your team.
2176600	2183600	Right. Um, yeah. So what I'm saying is like, we got to stick with our guys. If, if we got to break off from them, we should wait.
2183600	2190600	And then we got to be prepared. If we, if they tell us to do something that we don't want to do, it's gonna, they're going to know quick.
2190600	2191600	They're everywhere.
2191600	2194600	Stevie puts their hand on Julius's shoulder.
2194600	2203600	Hey man, uh, I know that it's, uh, it's hard to kind of break away from something that you've always known, but I think you're making the right call.
2203600	2211600	Well, thank you. Well, I mean, you made a good point and you guys are like the only people I've loved since my last handler.
2211600	2217600	And like, uh, I don't think I have any of that love left at where I am.
2217600	2224600	We do. We do love you, Julius. We're a family here at Cannes, but you're going to protect that family.
2224600	2229600	Yeah, it's going to be dangerous though. But is Ruth, where's Ruth at, at this point?
2229600	2238600	I mean, you guys got into the can van and just kind of watched Ruth walk around, do some circles.
2238600	2241600	There's not like a car that she went to or anything.
2241600	2246600	No, uh, she just walked down the street and then kind of disappears in the distance.
2246600	2248600	Peeking behind a trash can, waiting for us to come out.
2248600	2257600	Cal, run her over. Or, or let me. Or I could just shoot her. But then they'll, fuck, I wish X would text me back.
2257600	2259600	Don't, don't, don't run her over. Just let her be.
2259600	2261600	What if we brought her to X?
2261600	2264600	Julius is going to call X.
2264600	2265600	Speak your phone?
2265600	2266600	Yep.
2266600	2268600	Bring, bring, bring, bring.
2268600	2269600	Yes, Julius.
2269600	2278600	First off, they know, they know the whole thing. And second off, Ruth, she knows that we're here. She saw your name on my phone.
2278600	2279600	Okay.
2279600	2280600	What do we do with her? I see her right now.
2280600	2282600	You have eyes on the target?
2282600	2286600	Yeah. And she might have eyes on us from what I saw.
2286600	2287600	Her eyes are crazy.
2287600	2291600	Hey, X. Hi, Cal, Colorado here. Also, uh, Beck has the numbers in him.
2291600	2298600	No, I, I just, it's like normal that you see 836 everywhere. Everybody, everybody sees it everywhere.
2298600	2305600	Well, that's, that's nothing that a bit of therapy can't fix. Mr. Colorado, I'm sure of it.
2305600	2306600	Good. You hear that, Beck?
2306600	2308600	Probably costs 836 bucks.
2309600	2313600	X, Cal, Colorado. How much does it cost?
2313600	2318600	Oh, I'm with your insurance. I, I've really, I have no idea.
2318600	2320600	If you had to guess.
2320600	2325600	I don't know. Maybe $80 for a session. Is that normal?
2325600	2326600	How many cents?
2326600	2328600	How many cents? What is that question?
2328600	2330600	How many cents?
2330600	2333600	I don't know how many cents. It would be whatever the...
2333600	2337600	Okay, well, so 80 bucks. That's, see, you just encountered some numbers that weren't the numbers.
2337600	2340600	Probably like a convenience charge for the card.
2340600	2343600	It's probably like $83 and 60 cents.
2343600	2345600	Maggie said she was messing with you.
2345600	2349600	I'm going to need you to like 836 that out of your brain, dude.
2349600	2350600	Shit.
2350600	2351600	What the fuck?
2351600	2353600	Has it always been like that?
2353600	2354600	836.
2354600	2355600	God damn it.
2355600	2356600	Yeah, 836.
2356600	2358600	Son of a bitch.
2360600	2361600	What do we do with her?
2362600	2366600	Lure her into the van with Adderall and then tie her up.
2366600	2369600	We could bring her to you. We could kill her. She knows.
2369600	2372600	Actually, though, Julius, like, we were pretty good in there.
2372600	2377600	Like, she just knows that we know about Brock, but we don't even really know about Brock.
2377600	2380600	And we kind of alluded to the fact that we don't know about Brock.
2380600	2382600	But she knows that we're not cowboys.
2382600	2386600	And she looked at me with both her eyes and looked at me bad.
2386600	2389600	She looked at me with both her eyes once. It wasn't...
2389600	2390600	How is she...
2390600	2391600	Into both my eyes.
2391600	2393600	How is she doing?
2393600	2394600	Not bad.
2394600	2395600	Not bad?
2395600	2397600	No. Yes, bad.
2397600	2398600	Yeah.
2398600	2401600	She tried to smoke meth in front of us at the bar. Inside.
2401600	2403600	Were there witnesses?
2404600	2405600	No.
2405600	2409600	Sort of. Like, you could call them witnesses, but at the Foundry, nobody's ever a witness.
2409600	2411600	Oh, you were at the Foundry.
2411600	2413600	Maggie, yeah. Maggie keeps her mouth shut.
2413600	2415600	But also, you know, she's...
2415600	2417600	It's a rough part of town. All sorts wander in.
2417600	2420600	I don't think Maggie took Ruth as anything particularly odd.
2420600	2424600	Okay. Well, what do you think we should do, Julius?
2426600	2428600	I don't know. I don't know.
2428600	2430600	I've got, uh, like, a vote.
2430600	2433600	I know I'm not, like, part of, like, your guys' club.
2433600	2435600	Well, you're in it now.
2435600	2439600	Let's just, like, let her twist in the wind for a while, and maybe she'll lead us to something that we can use.
2439600	2440600	I love it.
2440600	2443600	X, Cal, Colorado. What do we think about that?
2443600	2450600	I think it's time that Julius had a bit more agency, and so if he thinks that's a good idea, what do you think, Julius?
2450600	2452600	I like it. Beck, I got a question.
2452600	2455600	Do you have an air tag on any of your equipment in here?
2455600	2456600	Yeah.
2456600	2457600	I need one.
2457600	2458600	Sure. Give me a sec.
2458600	2460600	And he goes and grabs a spare air tag.
2460600	2461600	Okay. Give me an Adderall.
2461600	2462600	That's a Stevie prop.
2462600	2463600	Stevie, give me an Adderall.
2463600	2465600	Yeah, yeah. I see what you're doing.
2465600	2469600	He takes the air tag and the Adderall.
2469600	2470600	That's brilliant.
2470600	2482600	I drive over to Ruth, and Julius hops out, and he offers her an Adderall, and while she's looking at it, he just shoves the air tag down into her purse.
2482600	2485600	Oh, I thought you were going to tape the air tag to the Adderall.
2485600	2489600	Or swallow it.
2489600	2491600	They're noticeably bigger than an Adderall.
2491600	2492600	I know. That's why it's funny.
2492600	2497600	This is an extra large Adderall.
2497600	2506600	I hear Cal say that in the background, and he doesn't drop the air tag in, slaps it on, and swallow this right now.
2506600	2511600	Rubs it down her throat like a dog.
2511600	2518600	He does all that, so she's seen the Adderall without it, and he slaps it on, and makes it better.
2518600	2519600	It makes it better.
2519600	2522600	The kid told us, I don't know anything about it. She said it's what they're all doing.
2522600	2527600	Go persuade.
2527600	2528600	Forty on a sixty.
2528600	2530600	I'll do it.
2530600	2536600	Quick, you're running out of time.
2536600	2539600	Cowboy, and he does little finger guns at her.
2539600	2541600	Whoa, that was cool.
2541600	2543600	The kids call that a cow patty.
2543600	2549600	Throws it in her mouth, and is like, all right, thank you.
2549600	2551600	See ya, you know, around.
2551600	2558600	Beck, in the background, in the van, is doing finger guns in the air. Like a yee-haw, cowboy.
2558600	2565600	I don't condone the use of modern technologies to pursue journalism, but this was well done, boys. Very well done.
2565600	2571600	As he's about to get back in the van, he looks at her and goes, my name's Jim. Just Jim.
2571600	2579600	Remember, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
2579600	2584600	He's hoping that she'll focus on that and forget his real name, and he hops back in the van.
2584600	2589600	She laughs like I did and throws her hands over her mouth and is like, all right, bye.
2589600	2590600	What's my name?
2590600	2591600	Jim.
2591600	2594600	Yeah, bye. And he hops in the van and he's like, let's get the fuck out of here.
2594600	2595600	Let's go.
2595600	2598600	Beck, is it showing up on your phone? Is she tagged?
2598600	2599600	I've got a blip.
2599600	2602600	Holy fuck yeah.
2602600	2608600	We should have her for the next, I don't know, twelve to twenty-four hours.
2608600	2614600	I don't know. It might get stuck up in there. She's probably on some opioids too, so she, I don't know that she.
2614600	2616600	I didn't get a downers vibe from her.
2616600	2618600	They like to mix it sometimes, I don't know.
2618600	2624600	Even though your whole crew is, you're all kind of downers.
2624600	2629600	Well, I guess Brock's dead, so what do we do now?
2629600	2630600	We were going to meet.
2630600	2631600	Let's go see Kaylee.
2631600	2635600	We were going to meet up with Kaylee, but to ask her about what the residue does?
2635600	2642600	No, we just have the lead that Dr. Murray said that somebody at the Brock Hargrave site saw people trying to climb into somebody else.
2642600	2646600	And we know that Kaylee tried to do that, tried to climb into the other Kaylee.
2646600	2654600	Yeah, let's go see Kaylee. Like, she might, I don't know what kind of shit Hargrave had going on, but obviously it was something crazy.
2654600	2659600	Actually, Cal, to your point, yeah, we would probably ask her if she saw that residue since we found the residue at the Brock site.
2659600	2662600	Maybe that's the connection? We can find that out.
2662600	2667600	Or maybe she knew Hargrave and knows something else about it. Lived to tell the tale.
2667600	2670600	She came into contact with the stuff somehow, so.
2670600	2672600	I think we gotta go talk to her.
2672600	2674600	The stuff being the craziness, right?
2674600	2675600	She got the goggle in her.
2675600	2679600	I resent that, maybe. I don't know, fuck that name, whatever.
2679600	2680600	And then we'll find your dad.
2680600	2682600	Yeah, and you can kill your dad, Stevie.
2682600	2683600	I don't, still.
2683600	2686600	Come on, Stevie, everybody wants to kill their dad.
2686600	2689600	I don't know if I want to.
2689600	2690600	We'll kill him for you.
2690600	2692600	Oh, boy.
2692600	2697600	I think it's important that Stevie do this themselves.
2697600	2699600	You're right, you're right.
2699600	2702600	That's the full house ending.
2702600	2704600	Oh, boy.
2704600	2709600	Oh, boy.
2709600	2716600	Julius is gonna, like, look around in the van for, like, press passes and give the prison a call.
2716600	2718600	But he's not gonna do it on speakerphone.
2718600	2723600	And he's gonna whisper in the corner of the van while he does it.
2723600	2725600	Are you implying that you want us to leave?
2725600	2728600	I would, if it could be a private conversation.
2728600	2729600	You're calling the prison?
2729600	2730600	Yes.
2730600	2731600	To talk to Kaylee?
2731600	2736600	No, to tell them, like, heads up, we're coming in and want to talk to this prisoner.
2736600	2738600	Oh, okay.
2738600	2739600	What if it's not?
2739600	2740600	Yeah, why do you want to do that privately?
2740600	2743600	There's definitely a reason I want to do it privately.
2743600	2745600	But we'd still hear what you were saying.
2745600	2748600	Not if I'm in the corner super quiet.
2748600	2749600	Okay.
2749600	2750600	Real stealth.
2750600	2752600	And then you guys are all alertness.
2752600	2758600	And if you beat him, then you get to stay in the room.
2758600	2760600	How'd you do on stealth?
2760600	2764600	I failed a 41 on a 40 for my alertness.
2764600	2765600	I failed as well, though.
2765600	2767600	I got a six on alertness.
2767600	2772600	Okay, so Thomas gets to stay in the room.
2772600	2773600	That sucks.
2773600	2776600	I needed to pee.
2776600	2779600	Hey, can you guys put your headphones in?
2779600	2780600	What?
2780600	2782600	Yeah, dude, sure, no problem.
2782600	2785600	Yeah, Stevie immediately throws on headphones as well.
2785600	2787600	Yeah, sure, sure.
2787600	2788600	Headphones.
2788600	2789600	Boing, boing.
2789600	2790600	Boing, boing.
2790600	2792600	This is Officer Peeler.
2792600	2795600	Ooh, that's gonna be rough.
2795600	2798600	This is Officer Peeler.
2798600	2801600	This is at the city jail.
2801600	2802600	Yeah, I'm calling with Can News.
2802600	2806600	We need to schedule a couple interviews.
2806600	2807600	Yeah, okay.
2807600	2808600	Can News.
2808600	2818600	Shout out to Sindre from Norway for Officer Stu Peeler, who is red-faced and intense and
2818600	2824600	talks like he has to force every word out through his throat or like he's taking a shit.
2824600	2826600	Nailed it, Zach.
2826600	2827600	Thanks.
2827600	2828600	Thanks, Sindre.
2828600	2829600	S-I-N-D-R-E?
2829600	2830600	Sindre.
2830600	2831600	Sindre.
2831600	2832600	Sindre.
2832600	2833600	Sindre.
2833600	2836600	Which of the, um, which of the...
2836600	2837600	One from each.
2837600	2838600	What are their names?
2838600	2840600	Kaylee Silver and...
2840600	2842600	Uh, Burl Summers.
2842600	2844600	What was that?
2844600	2845600	Burl Summers.
2845600	2847600	Yeah, when will you be here?
2847600	2848600	Forty-five minutes.
2848600	2849600	Okay.
2849600	2850600	Get them ready for you.
2850600	2852600	May have to wait a little bit.
2852600	2854600	Maybe at the front.
2854600	2855600	I'm ready.
2855600	2856600	Thank you.
2856600	2857600	Thanks.
2857600	2858600	Hey, Julius.
2858600	2859600	Yeah?
2859600	2861600	Who's Burl Summers?
2861600	2862600	Claire.
2862600	2863600	He is.
2868600	2870600	That did not work out well for you there, Luke.
2870600	2871600	Uh-uh.
2871600	2874600	You shouldn't have done personal business on cam time.
2874600	2878600	On cam time!
2878600	2883600	There's no secrets in the van, Julius.
2883600	2890600	As Cal hollers something out from the front of the can van, Stevie and Beck both are kind
2890600	2892600	of, like, startled and take off their headphones.
2892600	2893600	Sorry, guys.
2893600	2897600	I asked Julius, who's Burl Summers?
2897600	2899600	Well, fuck.
2899600	2901600	I just...
2901600	2905600	I figured we're going to the prison and I got a family member in there that I figured
2905600	2909600	I'd say hi to because I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to go back to the prison
2909600	2915600	This seems dangerous and I might not ever get to see him again, so I just wanted to
2915600	2917600	say hi while we talked to Kaylee.
2917600	2920600	And he's, like, not looking at anybody, just kind of looking down.
2920600	2922600	I don't understand, Julius.
2922600	2925600	Is that, like, what's his relation to you?
2925600	2928600	Well, it's my dad.
2928600	2930600	Have you seen him since you've been kidnapped?
2930600	2938600	Well, I mean, I guess I told you all about the firm and everything, so fuck it.
2939600	2945600	And then you guys pull up to the city jail and prison.
2945600	2953600	It is a complex here with a nice big visitor's office in the front with big concrete stairs
2953600	2959600	that lead up to a couple different segments of double glass doors in the front.
2959600	2964600	And there's just big concrete pillars on either side.
2965600	2968600	We're here, but Julius, you weren't quite done with what you were saying.
2968600	2974600	As Julius is getting ready to tell you, it flashes back to Julius getting abducted in
2974600	2982600	the woods by the man with, like, one stringy long hair on his chin and crazy hair.
2982600	2989600	And it cuts to that guy dragging Julius into the woods and then opening a bunker door and
2989600	2994600	dragging him down and telling him that he's got to go get supplies and information.
2994600	2996600	And then he locks the door behind him and leaves.
2996600	3001600	So Julius is looking all around this, like, underground bunker for a way to get out.
3001600	3006600	And he can't find a way out, but he finds this, like, library room that's filled with,
3006600	3012600	like, monster books and, like, occult shit and just wild crazy shit.
3012600	3018600	And he's, like, reading through some of it and he's, like, I've been abducted by a fucking maniac.
3018600	3022600	And he, like, keeps looking around in the room and he moves a painting.
3022600	3027600	And behind the painting is, like, a hollowed out area with two VHS tapes in it.
3027600	3031600	So he finds the VCR and he shoves the first tape in.
3031600	3040600	And it's, like, POV, like, handheld camera footage of a guy running through the woods
3040600	3044600	holding this camera chasing, like, a big rat.
3044600	3046600	And it's that for, like, 30 seconds.
3046600	3054600	And then it immediately cuts to, like, a giant rat in a dog kennel and its face is, like, human.
3054600	3056600	And it has big rat teeth.
3056600	3062600	And the guy behind the camera is whispering it to it, like, can you talk?
3062600	3064600	Hey, buddy, can you talk?
3064600	3065600	Say something.
3065600	3066600	Say something.
3066600	3072600	And it goes on for a couple minutes and Julius at 16 years old is, like, freaking out
3072600	3076600	and ejects the tape and puts the second tape in.
3076600	3080600	And it's the same quality camera, still handheld.
3080600	3084600	And the guy is, like, looks like it's kind of same pants and shoes and stuff.
3084600	3087600	But this time it's in a hospital hallway.
3087600	3091600	And Julius is watching and finally he's, like, running down the hallway
3091600	3095600	and he gets into a room and he sees, like, a woman who is giving birth.
3095600	3103600	And once the camera, like, kind of stops shaking, he sees that it's Julius' much younger mother.
3103600	3109600	And the man behind the camera is, like, hey, honey, I just made it in time.
3109600	3113600	And it's the same voice as the voice that was in the first VHS tape.
3113600	3115600	Holy shit.
3115600	3118600	And it cuts back to real life in Julius.
3118600	3122600	That's absolutely wild.
3122600	3123600	Yeah.
3123600	3124600	What?
3124600	3126600	So that happens for the audience.
3126600	3133600	And then, yeah, Julius just goes, well, when I got kidnapped I had never met my father.
3133600	3137600	He's the one that kidnapped me.
3137600	3139600	Yeah.
3139600	3144600	Yeah, so I'd never met my dad before I got taken in.
3144600	3147600	And he's, yeah, he's the one that took me in.
3147600	3157600	He'd been part of the firm since he found some kind of monster, like a rat, human, hybrid thing.
3157600	3158600	A rat boy.
3158600	3163600	They contacted him and he, I was, like, a year old when they made him leave.
3163600	3169600	And he came back to get me and they offered me a spot and I took it, you know.
3169600	3175600	I didn't see my mom a lot and I never knew my dad so I figured it'd be a good chance to get to know him.
3175600	3180600	And we worked together basically my whole adult life and, yeah.
3180600	3182600	What landed him here?
3182600	3184600	Oh, a fucking job gone wrong.
3184600	3191600	We were, we saw some crazy shit and we killed it and we had to, well, it was in a building and we burnt the building down.
3191600	3194600	And cop Scott called and I got away and he didn't.
3194600	3195600	He was a fall guy.
3195600	3197600	Yeah, I guess.
3197600	3198600	I haven't seen him since.
3198600	3201600	How long ago was that rat man hybrid thing?
3202600	3205600	I mean, shit, 28 years ago.
3205600	3207600	The math checks out.
3207600	3209600	What's going on with the rat man today?
3209600	3211600	I mean, he never really got into it.
3211600	3221600	It was just, he saw that out in the woods and he caught it and then he kind of fucking lost it and just was into conspiracy stuff and researching occult stuff.
3221600	3231600	And I guess he must have found something because that's when the firm contacted him and said, you know, it's either work for us or, or nothing.
3231600	3234600	Would you like to talk to him while we talk to Kaylee?
3234600	3236600	I wanted to go see Kaylee.
3236600	3243600	I was just going to tell him hi and speak my mind to him, you know, tell him what I've been thinking about him.
3243600	3247600	And then I, you know, and then tell him I'll probably never see him again.
3247600	3250600	We all know what we're getting into when we get into this.
3250600	3252600	So it's just a nice little thing.
3252600	3254600	I never thought I'd get to do it.
3254600	3255600	Julius, that is nice.
3255600	3258600	And I'm glad you don't want to kill your dad.
3258600	3259600	No.
3259600	3263600	You know, Hey, yeah, you're probably going to die, right?
3263600	3268600	You're probably going to die, but, uh, if you don't, you'll almost certainly go to jail.
3268600	3275600	Well, I mean, you might see your dad again, but, but also think about this, Julius, think about this.
3275600	3281600	What if we sick thousands of rat men onto the creatures of Godel Gorge?
3281600	3283600	I think please follow up with him about the rat man.
3283600	3290600	I'll ask him, but I'm pretty sure that the rat man, I mean, he, they took the rat man away from him and just assigned him to go do other.
3290600	3293600	Just ask if he, if he, if he ever learned anything more.
3293600	3294600	I'll ask him, I'll see.
3294600	3299600	Text X too. Rat men? Question mark?
3299600	3302600	I mean, it sounds like the stuff we've already been working with, right?
3302600	3304600	It's a, it's an animal man.
3304600	3306600	Yeah. I mean, I'll, I'll ask him and see.
3306600	3308600	But if this was like one of the first cases.
3308600	3313600	It could have been the thing where I made up the backstory and didn't even put the two together.
3313600	3320600	I thought it was, no, it sounded like a distinct type of man animal hybrid.
3320600	3324600	I liked it. I think we could, we could mobilize the rat man.
3324600	3326600	Yeah. We could easily find a way to tie this all in.
3326600	3331600	Okay. So cut that last part out that I said.
3331600	3342600	Yeah. I'll, I'll, I'll ask him about it. I, you know, I want to get in and learn with Kaylee Silver, but I'll, I'll just talk to him, you know, as soon as, unless they're both out there at the same time, you know.
3342600	3344600	We'll definitely talk to him if there's time.
3344600	3345600	Okay.
3345600	3354600	And, and Julius, like, okay, let's go in. Let's go talk to Kaylee.
3354600	3357600	Outside the steps. I'm like, back, back, get this one, get this one. Okay.
3357600	3358600	Beck sets up.
3358600	3374600	Cal kind of has his hands crossed out in front of them. Like they're about to be cuffed and he's like, I'm Cal, Colorado, and today I'm going to jail.
3374600	3375600	Hell yeah.
3375600	3376600	Nice.
3388600	3399600	Also, let me plug in my computer.
3399600	3400600	Plug it in, plug it in.
3400600	3404600	Let me plug in real quick to my lungs.
3404600	3405600	Whoa, sorry.
3405600	3406600	You're good.
3406600	3407600	Oh no.
3407600	3412600	No, dude, these things, you can run them over, dude.
3412600	3413600	And I do.
3413600	3417600	I got to squeeze every last drop of juice out of those pods.
3417600	3421600	Running over with your car like a toothpaste.
3421600	3422600	Yeah.
3422600	3427600	Here, don't let me run over your head, but tell me when it's coming out.
3427600	3430600	Just give a good hard tap on the fender there.
3430600	3433600	What about this? Puff it in, puff it in.
3433600	3434600	That sounds good.
3434600	3436600	Was that air fresh or what?
3436600	3437600	Glade.
3437600	3438600	Glade.
3438600	3443600	What if it was, instead of Glade, it was vape and then it was puff it in, puff it in.
3443600	3445600	You could do that in the same font for sure.
3445600	3446600	Oh yeah, for sure.
3446600	3448600	Oh, you could do that in the same font for sure.
3448600	3449600	Oh yeah, for sure, dude.
3449600	3451600	No doubt you could put that in the same font for sure.
3451600	3453600	If you're buying a candle, what flavor are you buying?
3453600	3454600	Fur.
3454600	3455600	Ooh, yeah.
3455600	3456600	For sure.
3456600	3457600	Any tree scent.
3457600	3458600	Sandalwood.
3458600	3459600	Burning fur.
3459600	3460600	Burning hair.
3460600	3462600	I think if I see sandalwood.
3462600	3463600	F-I-R.
3463600	3464600	E, fire.
3465600	3467600	Plus E or in parentheses.
3467600	3469600	Minus eight.
3469600	3472600	And if you divide that by the smell, then you get?
3472600	3473600	Eight through six.
3473600	3474600	Oh, shit.
3474600	3475600	Yeah, roll.
3475600	3476600	Roll back.
3476600	3477600	Roll back.
3477600	3480600	And it's all my fault.
3495600	3498600	He shit his pants.
3498600	3499600	I shit my pants.
3499600	3500600	Zach shit his pants for real.
3500600	3501600	Method acting.
3501600	3503600	We're gonna have to spray down the pod room.
3503600	3504600	It's all over the walls.
3504600	3506600	It's gonna be tough to clean that out.
3506600	3508600	You can tell your wife that you shit yourself on your podcast.
3508600	3509600	For money.
3509600	3511600	If you actually shit yourself, Zach looks crazy.
3511600	3513600	If you actually shit yourself, I'm sorry.
3513600	3514600	I've never shit myself before.
3514600	3515600	Did you?
3515600	3516600	I hope including now.
3516600	3519600	Is your blood back in your head or out of it?
3519600	3520600	Whatever happened?
3520600	3522600	Taylor Zach shit himself.
