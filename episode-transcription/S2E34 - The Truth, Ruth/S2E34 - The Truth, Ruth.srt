1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Salutations and hellos. It's your radio goddess, Wolf the Dog.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I host this little old show y'all may enjoy at the radio station known as 694.2 PTBP.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What do those numbers and letters stand for? I honestly have no idea.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I used a random number and letter generator to make it.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But what is not random is the intentional love y'all have sent our way.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This howlin' with Wolf is from Silvestri who tweeted about the show and tagged at PretendingPod on Twitter.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Which, don't even get old Wolfy started on that. I'll X a thread so fast you'll zuck your musk.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Anyway, tag us on the internet please.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Silvestri writes

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
to listen to all the bonus episodes.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now who is this Zach people keep speaking of?

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And why does he spell his name like that?

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What's so special about him?

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't know. Maybe one day I'll get to meet this Zach.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Probably not though, I'm uh, I'm pretty busy.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Anyway, thanks for writing in.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Next time if you could talk a little less about a Zach and a little more about a Wolf

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
that would be pretty nice of ya.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If you want to write up something for your wolf to how,

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
tag at PretendingPod on Instagram threads or Twitter.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Tag users slash PretendingToBePeople on Reddit.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Or write up a five star review on the podcast app of your choice.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And get it in front of these here eyes of mine.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh, my favorite podcast app?

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
For reviews, it's definitely the Apple Podcast app.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Writing out a five star review on Apple Podcast does wonders for us here at PTBP,

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
which hopefully will allow us to continue broadcasting these wondrously terrible stories from 694.2,

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
the city's oldest and only radio station.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Whoa, what's that?

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You want to support the show financially in exchange for a wild amount of really dope fully edited bonus episodes?

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The Patreon link is in the show notes.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You want a shirt or a hat or a fanny pack or a beach towel?

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's so fun, I love that for you.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The merch store link is in the show notes.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You want to see all the links I tirelessly typed up to all of our shit?

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Fucking bet, babies, the links are in the show notes.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
There, there, I know change is hard, but it's already time for the news.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Last time, on episode 33, that's not Brock,

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Daddy ran away with the drone footage of the old timey gymnasium with the bloody throne under the basketball hoop.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So they decided to head to the foundry, both for a drink and to hopefully meet up with Dr. Brock Hargrave.

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:45,000
In the foundry's parking lot, Beck showed the team a clip of the Jaguar that jumped on the train over Godel's Gate to Grover's Gorge,

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
seemingly speaking as it slid down the side of the strange smooth chasm.

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Inside the foundry, the can crew was approached by a ghastly gaunt woman who called herself Elijah.

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It muttered about 836 under her breath while she openly discussed Dr. Hargrave and Dr. Murray

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and her status as a cowboy before she attempted to smoke meth at the table.

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Taking us now to the foundry where Stevie is feeding this Elijah woman Adderall so she doesn't smoke methamphetamine in public,

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
it just feels so right.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
All my fault.

51
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What's he building in there?

52
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You know that song?

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Chocolate of course.

54
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's like chocolate of course. Of course.

55
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll buy us IMAX tickets for that one.

56
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh gosh. Look how big the chocolate is.

57
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I thought he was going to redo Chocolat.

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That'd be better.

59
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Timothy Chocolat.

60
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What other Johnny Depp movies could he do?

61
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If Timothée Chalamet played...

62
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Rango?

63
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That'd be crazy.

64
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What was that movie? It was a book I think.

65
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The Rum Diaries?

66
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Fearing Loathing in Las Vegas.

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Fearing Loathing in Las Vegas?

68
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Dude, but Timothée Chalamet in Leaving Las Vegas?

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Do you think he could do it?

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Do you think he could do it?

71
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He could do a pretty good job at it.

72
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
After seeing the trailer to Wonka, you think that he could do it?

73
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah, I think it's not him being bad as the movie is bad.

74
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You know what? No shit. He would be a great What's Eating Gilbert Grape.

75
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah. The mom.

76
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Or the grape.

77
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The grape.

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Being grape of course.

79
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Tell us what you're doing over there.

80
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
From now on, when I think Timothée Chalamet, it'll be verbing of course.

81
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Peabody Award.

82
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I think that's kind of how you say it.

83
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Peabody?

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Peabody.

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Nah, say it in a British accent.

86
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Peabody Award.

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The Peabody Award.

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Sorry dude.

89
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Were you just saying it in a British accent?

90
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You guys are saying body so hard which is not how anybody says it.

91
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Peabody.

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Peabody.

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Peabody.

94
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Peabody.

95
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Peabody. I think it's Peabody.

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Peabody.

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Peabody.

98
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Peabody Award.

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Peabody.

100
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Peabody Award.

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This is the Peabody.

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The first annual Peabody's.

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
For highest score on the turfs, has Cal won a Peabody Award?

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yeah, for sure.

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
A what?

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
A Peabody Award?

107
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Peabody?

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Peabody?

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Peabody?

110
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Peabody.

111
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
There were a couple websites that awarded him a Peabody Award but he wasn't really aware

112
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
of that.

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Was he deserving?

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I think it was more of a wish, like a wish that like buddies we'd like to pee with.

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh, okay.

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah.

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
A hundred percent.

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But he's also won a Peabody.

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah.

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's like comedians in cars but it's journalists in bathrooms.

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We're gonna go check out this restaurant and spend a whole lot of time in their bathroom.

122
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And it's carpool karaoke so they sing in there too.

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
A stall to stall interview.

124
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah, interview.

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You know what Julius has been talking to us about in the van?

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Pitching.

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But like the thing is, you know, like on Hot Ones, they have to eat the wings.

128
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You have to take a shit during the interview.

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If you can't take a shit, they send a camera up there and find out what's going on.

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And like everyone in the comments like makes fun of you for like not taking and picking

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
up shit.

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Dude, it's like we call it talking shit.

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Shit talking.

134
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Shit talking.

135
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Taking the piss.

136
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Lord took a shit like nobody else, dude.

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Who would the best shitter be, do you think?

138
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What a weird joke.

139
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's somebody who's watched a lot of Hot Ones.

140
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I think there would be different groups of fans who would want to see different kinds

141
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
of shit.

142
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Because like best shit is pretty subjective.

143
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Does it show the shit after they did it?

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Oh yeah, there's a camera down there watching the shit go in.

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And so you're like, yeah, no ass, just shit.

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's a perpendicular.

147
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah.

148
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Did you see?

149
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's tasteful, okay?

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's tasteful.

151
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But some people like, I think if it's a more spectacular splash, that might do it for some

152
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
people.

153
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But you'll see a lot of people in the comment going like, eat fiber scrub.

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I personally would be more impressed by how much of a solid log can you get out before

155
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
it has to get pinched off?

156
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Like how much of just a smoothie assembly line are you?

157
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Because at that point you're showing off your sphincter.

158
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah.

159
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
No, no, no, no, no.

160
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's only a poop cam.

161
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
No ass cam.

162
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
No, no, no, no.

163
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I didn't mean, you're saying the power thereof to not cut it off.

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Right.

165
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah.

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Full relaxation.

167
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Do you think we've lost some listeners?

168
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah.

169
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Did you see Obama went on talking shit?

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
They're getting big names, dude.

171
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Oh my God.

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So smooth.

173
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I would choose George Bush though for that conversation.

174
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
H.W. or W?

175
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
W.

176
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
W.

177
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I paint little Iraqi children.

178
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Oh, that's the Onion article.

179
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He's shitting and painting and interviewing and it's honestly, it's pretty cool.

180
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
He talks about how he did 9-11.

181
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He's so, he's so plain and fast and loose in there.

182
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The scoops they get on talking shit.

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yeah.

184
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I wasn't like totally, I didn't totally know about it.

185
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I just, you know, I knew it was happening.

186
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
If we decide that talking shit doesn't work for the intro, what could we pivot to here

187
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
roughly?

188
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I think it's pretty good shit.

189
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah.

190
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And we're finished with it now and now we're starting episode 34 pretending to be people.

191
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Welcome.

192
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The island of Dr. Insano.

193
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We have been learning some things and we are at the foundry and we are around a table.

194
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I feel like we've got a bunch more about to be learned.

195
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It shows, it's like you just unpaused it and it's Julius saying rock.

196
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I tell you what.

197
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Okay.

198
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
All right.

199
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Calm down.

200
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Calm down.

201
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So it was Elijah, right?

202
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Can I call you Elijah?

203
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That's right.

204
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You can call me Ruth for sure.

205
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Or wait, sorry.

206
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What?

207
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Ruth.

208
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Okay.

209
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll call you Ruth.

210
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Whatever you want.

211
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes.

212
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What made you want to meet with us?

213
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I forgot to ask you.

214
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I was going to ask you what you thought of Dr. Murray.

215
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You must've gotten a, how do you know?

216
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
She's good.

217
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
She's a doctor.

218
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
They're all kind of like that.

219
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But like personality wise, what do you, what do you think about her?

220
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Well, it doesn't really matter.

221
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
We're talking about one doctor, you know?

222
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
No, just like whether or not she's a disciplined and good person.

223
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I mean, she helped us.

224
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Do you think you're a disciplined and good person?

225
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
She growls as she looks across the table.

226
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You were about to go smoke meth.

227
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Smoke meth.

228
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I do what needs to be done for this country.

229
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Are you willing to do the same?

230
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Meth?

231
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Just, I just have to stop it.

232
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He got caught.

233
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
He got caught.

234
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
He got caught.

235
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
He got caught.

236
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's just, it's going to get everyone, you know?

237
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Cause we're all just considered as sheep to be slaughtered at this point, you know?

238
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So it is, it's fine.

239
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
He got caught by the 836.

240
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
He got caught by the 836.

241
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What does that mean?

242
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
What is the 836?

243
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't, I don't know exactly, but I did know that if water is measured in cubic feet and

244
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
it's built in units of a hundred cubic feet, okay?

245
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
A hundred cubic feet, HCF, HCF, 836.

246
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's, it's holy cow farms.

247
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's, it's the eighth letter of the alphabet, the third letter of the alphabet, and the

248
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
sixth letter of the alphabet, HCF.

249
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
The milk place?

250
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Which is equal, yes, to 748 gallons of water or milk, thank you.

251
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And if you start at eight, 748 gallons, right?

252
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,600
So if you start at eight, go backwards and you have a four minus one is three and a seven

253
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,800
minus one is six, uh, 836 and if you take both of those negative ones together and the

254
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,100
minus cancel out and then you get plus 11, which if you do that eight times to the original

255
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:52,340
number of 748, you get Butter Cook.

256
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,040
Say it with me, 836.

257
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
That's right.

258
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,600
She points at Julius again.

259
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,600
Wait, 11 times 748?

260
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Yeah, that last part I don't think had to have come.

261
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
That didn't work.

262
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,600
No, you multiply the 11 times 8 and add it.

263
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
What's your name?

264
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Julius.

265
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Julius knows what I'm talking about.

266
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
Okay.

267
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
She's making a lot of sense.

268
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
Yeah.

269
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
It sounds like you've got this all figured out.

270
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,600
I mean, you were talking earlier about something wild.

271
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,600
I mean, it sounds like you saw something wild too.

272
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,600
I just saw a dead man, a pair of legs of a man named Jimmy Corrigan.

273
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Like that stupid comic book?

274
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
I don't know nothing about it.

275
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
My daughter, she made me read it.

276
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
It's very sad.

277
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,600
So who, do you guys know who Jimmy Corrigan is?

278
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
No.

279
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
What?

280
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,600
He's an American patriot who lost his top half.

281
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,600
At the same time as Brock?

282
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
Yes, lost his life.

283
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
How did Brock know him?

284
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,600
I may have sent Jimmy to go looking for...

285
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:02,600
And at that moment you see all the TVs in the foundry all cut to CNN for breaking news.

286
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Pan News Network.

287
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,600
9-11-2.

288
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Finally you see all the TVs flashing breaking news across the bottom of each of the screens

289
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,600
and your eyes inadvertently go to the screen showing can.

290
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,600
Julius is saying, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.

291
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:35,600
And a seemingly rushed Isabella Caya is kind of getting herself together as the camera

292
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,600
goes live on her and she says, yeah, yeah, yes, yes, yes, yes, hello.

293
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:51,600
To everyone in the city, I do have some heartbreaking news for you.

294
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,600
American tycoon, Fred Godel is dead.

295
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Cal looks over at Stevie.

296
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Stevie is stunned, shocked, mouth slightly ajar with like amazement, astonishment, confusion.

297
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,600
Maybe, maybe some of your brother still is in there.

298
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:23,600
My, my, it's like their ears are just like ringing and they're just looking down and

299
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,600
they started kind of stumbling up from their chair and walk across the foundry to the bathroom.

300
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Do you think it got old?

301
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Hey, Maggie, can you turn that up?

302
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:42,600
We are, um, just now getting word that Godel company has put out a statement about the

303
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:49,600
passing of Fred Godel Monday night.

304
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
That's counting on his fingers.

305
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Just told his notes.

306
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
They're going to find out how many days this was.

307
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Yesterday was Thursday, Monday, July 4th, 2022.

308
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:11,600
And at that moment, each of you starts thinking to yourself, Oh my God, did I miss the 4th of July?

309
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,600
You saw Fred Godel after that.

310
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,600
He was at a gas station on the road as we were departing Godel's gorge.

311
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Shit.

312
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Wait, who realizes it?

313
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
All of us at the same time.

314
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
Wait a minute.

315
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,600
Are you guys thinking what I'm thinking?

316
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
Say it all together now.

317
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:39,600
We saw Fred Godel after he left.

318
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
After he's supposed to have died.

319
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
So he couldn't be dead.

320
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
He's not dead?

321
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
He's not dead, Stevie.

322
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
Wait.

323
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
No, that's Elijah.

324
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
I'm not Stevie.

325
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
You guys, dude, he sounds kind of similar.

326
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,600
I thought Stevie had come back.

327
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
I do go by many names.

328
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Julius, yell at Stevie again.

329
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Stevie!

330
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Stevie, Stevie, come back.

331
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
He's not dead.

332
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
We probably have to kill him.

333
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Or at least capture him.

334
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Contain.

335
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Maim.

336
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,600
It's like good news, bad news sort of for everything in general for you.

337
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,600
Yeah, I know they probably felt a lot of complicated feelings when you heard about the death of

338
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
your father.

339
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,600
I know I sure did, but he's not really dead.

340
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
You still have to kill him.

341
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Your mission is not finished.

342
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,600
You don't need to process stuff now, but later you will for sure.

343
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
This is like a good practice for that.

344
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,600
Hey, Ruth, cover your ears.

345
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
No.

346
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,600
Fuck.

347
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,600
I don't have any money.

348
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,600
As he reaches out to me.

349
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
She goes, do you have a vape on you?

350
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Do we need anything else from her?

351
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
I mean, I feel like we need a lot of stuff.

352
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
What is your deal, dude?

353
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,600
Are you here to get to the bottom of this?

354
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Yes.

355
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,600
We want to find out the truth.

356
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
We're the news.

357
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Ruth.

358
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Oh, nice.

359
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Cal, good one.

360
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Thank you.

361
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
You can't deny the dog.

362
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,600
You can't deny the dog.

363
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Not as good.

364
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
There.

365
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
You can't deny the rhyme.

366
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:16,600
She's looking at you, Cal, with one eye and the other one is searching your chin, your

367
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
mouth.

368
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Yeah, he's got the same sort of facial situation as you.

369
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Who's that, then?

370
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Does this person literally have independent motion of eyes?

371
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Or is that just a fun way to describe the way Googly-

372
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
It's just a fun way to describe her disability.

373
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,600
You're not fucking sure.

374
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
I nudge Julius.

375
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Julius, remember that joke about being a chameleon?

376
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,600
Look at those eyes.

377
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,600
We're talking about animal people and shit.

378
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
What do chameleons like to eat?

379
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,600
Oh, like flies, right?

380
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Bugs.

381
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Yeah.

382
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
There sure are a lot of bugs in here.

383
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Have you noticed that?

384
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
A lot of bar flies.

385
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
A lot of bar flies.

386
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Guys, shut up.

387
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
What do you think about the bugs in here?

388
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Okay, let me just step away from the game real quick and ask you a question about how

389
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,600
you want season two to go.

390
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Yeah.

391
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
We wanted to be a chameleon lady.

392
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,600
Duh.

393
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
We want chameleon, of course.

394
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,600
The whole time.

395
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
In both arcs.

396
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,600
All I'm saying is that my house address is 8 Oak Avenue.

397
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:45,600
8 is the first number, and Oak is three letters, and Avenue is also three letters, or six letters.

398
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
So that's 836.

399
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,600
And also, them, what are they calling them?

400
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Lightning tornadoes?

401
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,600
They're leaving those smooth holes in the ground everywhere?

402
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
Yeah, what about them?

403
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,600
They're occurring at the exact opposite side of the world every four hours and 18 minutes

404
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,600
from when they hit.

405
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
And what's the circumference of one of those circles?

406
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
Hitting another random location.

407
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Actually, I think that might be it.

408
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,600
Two minutes and nine seconds later, or maybe those seconds add up to some sort of time

409
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
unit that's 836.

410
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
836.

411
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,600
I wrote it down for a reason, but it's another one of my 836.

412
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
836.

413
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
Is that your house?

414
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
836.

415
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,600
Yeah, 836.

416
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,600
What?

417
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
Is that your house?

418
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
It's just 836.

419
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
What?

420
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,600
This is at your house?

421
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
836.

422
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
What?

423
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
You wrote this down.

424
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Yeah.

425
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,600
That's at your house.

426
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
836.

427
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
What?

428
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
Do you have it in an email or something?

429
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
Could you just forward that to us?

430
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Do you fax?

431
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
I love to fax.

432
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
Thomas' eyes lit up.

433
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Oh my God.

434
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,600
He's so happy.

435
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,600
Thomas is so in character.

436
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,600
Count like four.

437
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
It starts to write down the...

438
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
What do you think?

439
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Oh, yeah.

440
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,600
Let me give you the can, the fax number, okay?

441
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
Okay.

442
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
It's 836.

443
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Son of a bitch.

444
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
Look at that.

445
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,600
It's everywhere.

446
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,600
Look at that.

447
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
Look at that.

448
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,600
It's everywhere.

449
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,600
Look at that.

450
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,600
Look at that.

451
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
So it's the area code for the city.

452
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
That's all it is?

453
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
All our phone numbers start with 836.

454
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
Yeah, but is it more?

455
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
Hey, Maggie.

456
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,600
How much is old fashioned with tax?

457
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,600
Why do you want to know?

458
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
It's like seven something maybe.

459
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
Fuck.

460
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
Oh, close.

461
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
It was close.

462
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,600
And then she punches it in.

463
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,600
After tax, it's 836.

464
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Holy shit.

465
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
What is this?

466
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,600
The fucking Truman Show?

467
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
We do always have a camera on us.

468
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,600
Everybody roll grip.

469
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
Yeah, that's a failure.

470
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,600
I fail.

471
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
I fail as well.

472
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Well, perfect.

473
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,600
Then we get a little group madness here.

474
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,600
Why don't you tell us exactly what the fuck is going on here, chameleon lady?

475
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
She never answered the fly question.

476
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,600
You eat flies, don't you?

477
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,600
And Stevie walks out of the bathroom.

478
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,600
He's not dead.

479
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Your dad's not dead.

480
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
You still have to kill him.

481
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,600
This woman's a fucking chameleon.

482
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,600
She stands up and backs away.

483
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,600
And she's like, I'm not a chameleon.

484
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
I'm not a chameleon.

485
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,600
My mouth is dry from the amphetamines or whatever I was given by your friend.

486
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,600
And I'm not a chameleon.

487
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,600
Okay, Stevie.

488
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,600
She may or may not be a chameleon.

489
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,600
Yeah?

490
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Wait, did you say my dad's not dead?

491
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,600
Your dad's not dead, Stevie.

492
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
We saw him.

493
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,600
We saw him after he was supposed to have died.

494
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
On the way back from the gorge.

495
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
At the gas station.

496
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
At the gas station.

497
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Wait, when did they say he died?

498
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
That doesn't mean-

499
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
July 4th.

500
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
Okay.

501
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,600
8 minus 3 is 6.

502
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:12,600
Okay, just because they said that he died on a different day doesn't mean he's not dead.

503
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600
But that is good, I guess.

504
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
What's his birthday?

505
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
I think we already did this bit.

506
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,600
Because I said August 36th.

507
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,600
Perfect.

508
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,600
Fuck.

509
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,600
It's coming up everywhere.

510
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,600
Zach, I need to know how much sand I lost.

511
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,600
Yeah.

512
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
By the way, you all just lose one grip for that.

513
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
That's what, yeah.

514
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,600
I'm sorry.

515
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
How dare you apologize.

516
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,600
That hits me right smack onto my breaking point.

517
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,600
Do you break then?

518
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,600
Oh, that's fortuitous.

519
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,600
I mean, Luke and Thomas can leave the room if they want, but I think we all know what

520
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
your mania's gonna be.

521
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
Oh, yeah.

522
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,600
He's got the numbers in him.

523
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
Life is a circle.

524
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,600
Becky's got the numbers in him.

525
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,600
Oh, boy.

526
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,600
Is it so it's not a phobia, it's a mania?

527
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
Oh, I guess that's up to you.

528
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,600
You can do whichever one you want and you don't have to tell any of us.

529
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
You can just do it.

530
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
Okay.

531
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,600
I bet we'll figure it out real quick.

532
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
Real quick.

533
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
It's either ah or ooh.

534
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,600
What do you guys think it's gonna be?

535
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,600
Oh, I think it's gonna be ooh.

536
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,600
I think it's gonna be ooh.

537
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
Interesting.

538
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
Maggie, Maggie.

539
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,600
Are you just fucking with us?

540
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,600
About what?

541
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
The price.

542
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Yeah.

543
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,600
Well, at least that didn't do any serious mental damage.

544
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,600
And a joke that does no harm is all good.

545
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
All on fun, right, Beck?

546
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,600
Yeah, I mean, if it was actually fucking with us, it could have been 836.

547
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,600
In fact, I bet it fucking was 836.

548
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
That's what I'm talking about.

549
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Yeah, right there.

550
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
That fire.

551
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
You ready to join up?

552
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
You ready to do this?

553
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,600
Octopus.

554
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,600
Tripod.

555
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
Spider.

556
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Yes.

557
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,600
Holy shit!

558
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
Yep.

559
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
Holy shit!

560
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,600
Yep.

561
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,600
What's it mean?

562
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
That's exactly right.

563
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
Spiders have...

564
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,600
I'm talking like you now.

565
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,600
It's hard not to hear.

566
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
It's a fun voice.

567
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
Spiders have eight legs.

568
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
Oh, phew.

569
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
That's 838.

570
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Okay.

571
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,600
But most insects have six legs.

572
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
Oh shit!

573
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Ah!

574
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
Holy shit!

575
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,600
Almost any bug.

576
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,600
Anything you'd consider a bug, really.

577
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,600
It's everywhere.

578
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,600
It's all around us.

579
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:38,600
Julius is going to text X, do we know Ruth slash Elijah, and like snap a pic.

580
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Like kind of like just above the table.

581
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,600
It flashes and like...

582
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Yeah, roll stealth.

583
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,600
Ooh, 42 and a 40.

584
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,600
What was that?

585
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Why'd you do that?

586
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
Oops.

587
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,600
And he hits it.

588
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
Oops.

589
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
Give me that phone.

590
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,600
No way.

591
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
Give me that.

592
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
Give me that.

593
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:07,600
Yeah, he's going to defend himself harder than he needs to.

594
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,600
Okay, 54 on a 60.

595
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,600
No, 79 on a 70.

596
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,600
She rips away your phone from you and...

597
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,600
He pulls his gun out and points it at her.

598
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,600
All right, everybody.

599
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,600
Calm down.

600
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,600
Uh oh.

601
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,600
Uh oh.

602
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
Hey.

603
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
Give me back my phone or I'll fucking kill you.

604
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Uh, Beck is kind of looking around.

605
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,600
We're just doing a play.

606
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
We're just acting out a play.

607
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,600
Maggie rings the bell and says, hey, put that fucking gun down.

608
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,600
Yeah, Julius, don't pull a gun in Maggie's bar and hey, you know, if you want our friend

609
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:47,600
Stevie to give you some more of their Adderall, maybe you should give Julius his phone back.

610
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,600
He like slowly starts to lower the gun but is like reaching his hand out, like expecting

611
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,600
her to meet with the phone.

612
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,600
What is the number for X listed in your phone?

613
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,600
It's under Diggory, not X because no one actually calls her X.

614
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,600
That is the X-Files, right?

615
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Right.

616
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,600
She scolded her.

617
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,600
Barely knew her.

618
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,600
Um, it's under Diggory because that's how he was introduced.

619
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,600
As she hands the phone back to you, she like turns it facing herself.

620
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
So she's like looking at the text.

621
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Julius grabs it as quick as he can out of her hand.

622
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,600
Huh.

623
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,600
She's got one eye on you and the other eye on you.

624
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,600
Guys, we need to go.

625
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,600
Julius starts heading towards the door.

626
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
But it's our news bar.

627
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
She should go.

628
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
As Julius is walking away.

629
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,600
Julius is also texting X, uh, she knows.

630
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:50,600
She's hollering at him and she says, uh, it's a big world, Julius.

631
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,600
Fuck.

632
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Which side are you on?

633
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
Julius leaves the foundry.

634
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,600
As Beck is leaving, he wants to say, and uh, you got Cal's fax number.

635
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,600
I'd love to see some of that information on the 836 you've gathered.

636
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:13,600
Yes, we are the sheep, but if we all are aware of the machine that is doing the slaughtering,

637
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,600
can we not rise?

638
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,600
Can you?

639
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,600
Maybe.

640
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Hmm.

641
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
You want to be the sheep.

642
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
I'm confused.

643
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,600
We can rise.

644
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,600
Can sheep go upstairs?

645
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
How many more than cows?

646
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
I think they can't look up.

647
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
Is that right?

648
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,600
Texas dogs can't look up.

649
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,600
How many, uh, how many more of them pills you got there?

650
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,600
Stevie Cal gets between Stevie and uh, and Ruth.

651
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,600
Now we're just going to back away.

652
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:51,600
Stevie's going to lay down one more 10 milligram instant release Adderall right there, right there on the floor.

653
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,600
And we're all just going to back away.

654
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,600
And you're going to pick that up and you're going to leave Maggie's bar.

655
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,600
We're going to leave it too.

656
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,600
And then you can have your little X-Files war or whatever. I don't know.

657
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:11,600
And as you slowly start backing away, she reaches down slowly, keeping eye on you.

658
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,600
Both picks up the pill.

659
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:21,600
And as you leave, I think you guys are probably at the parking lot and you see her leave.

660
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,600
Bye, Ruth.

661
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,600
Like in her car?

662
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
No, leave the bar.

663
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,600
Oh.

664
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,600
She waves.

665
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,600
Guys, it's Ruth.

666
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,600
Julius is like pacing back and forth and like just looking at his phone waiting for a response.

667
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,600
She has some really good ideas about things.

668
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,600
Julius, can you tell us what the fuck is going on with your little cowboy club or whatever?

669
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,600
Yeah, I'll tell you in a little bit, but it's imperative that she does not know where we're going.

670
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,600
We didn't tell her about the footage that we have. She cannot know about that.

671
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
They don't want it out.

672
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
Who's, who's?

673
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
She's the bad guys. I'm the good guys.

674
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,600
Who's in charge and who's rebelling?

675
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,600
There's a lot of details. I know what Diggory tells me and what-

676
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
You don't-

677
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
Diggory?

678
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,600
You don't know, you don't know who's, you don't know who's anything.

679
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:16,600
I know that it exists and I know that you just, you follow orders and that's, that's what I know.

680
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,600
It's what I've known for years.

681
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,600
Do you know who those cowboys she mentioned are?

682
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,600
He does two thumbs to himself.

683
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Oh, you're a cowboy?

684
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Yeehaw.

685
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,600
But she thinks they're the cowboys. You're all cowboys?

686
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,600
She thinks that Dr. Murray is no longer a cowboy, right?

687
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,600
He doesn't do two thumbs to himself. He does two fingers over to Ruth.

688
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
And you're Diggory?

689
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,600
X.

690
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,600
X.

691
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,600
Here's what I know. I take orders from her now.

692
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:56,600
Before that, I took orders from someone else since I was a teen.

693
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,600
That's all I've done and I never questioned it. I never needed to.

694
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,600
I just knew you do what they tell you and you're going to be okay.

695
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,600
And you get to find out so much.

696
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,600
You get to find out so much.

697
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,600
Cow like puts his hands on your shoulders and he says,

698
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,600
Yeah, but you see, you're a can man now.

699
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,600
You take your orders from me. We're the ones who find out so much.

700
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,600
You've got to admit, we've been finding out a lot.

701
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,600
Julius just about loses his mind, like...

702
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,600
Come with us, son. We'll tell you what to do.

703
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,600
Okay, I've got to tell you everything just so that like...

704
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,600
We're all on the same page.

705
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:45,600
Yeah, because if I just go with you guys, it's not going to be safe for any of us.

706
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,600
Okay, why don't you tell us what you know?

707
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:55,600
Well, when, you know, when I was 16, I got taken into the firm and...

708
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,600
By that scary guy, right? That you told us about?

709
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,600
Oh shit, she's still here. Oh, sorry, Stevie.

710
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,600
No, yeah, it's me. I have a much gravelier and like upper register voice.

711
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,600
I thought it was Ruth, too.

712
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Whereas the other ones, less gravelly and lower and a little southern.

713
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,600
But I'll try to change them even more in the future.

714
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,600
What did they say?

715
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,600
No, they're distinct. It's just...

716
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,600
You were taken by the firm when you were 16?

717
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:27,600
Yeah, I got... Well, initially I got taken, but yeah, I like joined up with them and...

718
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:33,600
I mean, literally since I was 16, I've been doing this like 13 years. I've fallen the orders.

719
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
Wait, what's the wildest thing you've ever done?

720
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,600
Yeah, what's the wackiest thing you've done for these guys?

721
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
Well, I'll tell you wacky.

722
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,600
Wild, too. And then Beck, what do you want to...

723
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,600
Scary. Just like real quick, you know, just like super easy.

724
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,600
Come up with three really complicated things for us.

725
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Well, like...

726
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,600
Whole new stories.

727
00:33:52,600 --> 00:34:01,600
My old handler and I, we had to like dig up a whole graveyard of people to like inspect them to make sure...

728
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,600
So that's the wacky one.

729
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:11,600
Well, and then like the cops came because someone saw us digging up every single body we dug up.

730
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,600
Well, scariest was when the cops showed up and there was like 10 of them.

731
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,600
And then I guess like the worst thing was after me and my handler killed all 10 of them.

732
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:27,600
And then we had to bury all the bodies plus 10 more back after we looked at all the dead bodies.

733
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:32,600
And we didn't even find what we were looking for. So it sucked, too. So that's your answer.

734
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,600
Whoa. Knocked out all three in one.

735
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,600
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

736
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:41,600
Although after that, like it was not hard to kill any more people. It was not hard at all.

737
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
I imagine it wasn't.

738
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,600
It was kind of fun sometimes.

739
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,600
Oh, no.

740
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,600
Okay. Yeah.

741
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,600
You got to...

742
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,600
Not every time.

743
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:57,600
When you share a newsman with a van, you need to know his deepest secrets and now you do.

744
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,600
You share a newsman with a van?

745
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
Luke, do you have luck?

746
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
No.

747
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,600
Yeah, you do.

748
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
Oh, hell yeah.

749
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
Good job.

750
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
Nice.

751
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
Yeah, that was awesome.

752
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:16,600
All of that to like say, I know that the shit that I got told to do was almost always dangerous.

753
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:24,600
Someone almost always got hurt. And the people above the person above me, there's a person above them.

754
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,600
And it just gets worse the higher up you go.

755
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:35,600
And if we piss them off, it's not going to be good. And we're already, we don't agree on how to run things or they don't.

756
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,600
And so they're going to be dangerous now.

757
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,600
Which side has more power, yours or theirs?

758
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,600
I mean, it's hard to say, but theirs.

759
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,600
No, it's hard to say. It's hard to say, but ours.

760
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
That seems harder.

761
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,600
Like the non-messed out ones?

762
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,600
Well, they're not all met well.

763
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,600
And he thinks, yeah.

764
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,600
Wow.

765
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,600
Son of a bitch.

766
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:11,600
But here's the deal, like the footage that we have, my team, we want to show it. We need to get it out there. Their team?

767
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,600
Wants to put the kibosh on it.

768
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,600
Exactly.

769
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,600
So we're leaning your team.

770
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:23,600
Right. Um, yeah. So what I'm saying is like, we got to stick with our guys. If, if we got to break off from them, we should wait.

771
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:30,600
And then we got to be prepared. If we, if they tell us to do something that we don't want to do, it's gonna, they're going to know quick.

772
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,600
They're everywhere.

773
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,600
Stevie puts their hand on Julius's shoulder.

774
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:43,600
Hey man, uh, I know that it's, uh, it's hard to kind of break away from something that you've always known, but I think you're making the right call.

775
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:51,600
Well, thank you. Well, I mean, you made a good point and you guys are like the only people I've loved since my last handler.

776
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:57,600
And like, uh, I don't think I have any of that love left at where I am.

777
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:04,600
We do. We do love you, Julius. We're a family here at Cannes, but you're going to protect that family.

778
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:09,600
Yeah, it's going to be dangerous though. But is Ruth, where's Ruth at, at this point?

779
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:18,600
I mean, you guys got into the can van and just kind of watched Ruth walk around, do some circles.

780
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,600
There's not like a car that she went to or anything.

781
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:26,600
No, uh, she just walked down the street and then kind of disappears in the distance.

782
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,600
Peeking behind a trash can, waiting for us to come out.

783
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:37,600
Cal, run her over. Or, or let me. Or I could just shoot her. But then they'll, fuck, I wish X would text me back.

784
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,600
Don't, don't, don't run her over. Just let her be.

785
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
What if we brought her to X?

786
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,600
Julius is going to call X.

787
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
Speak your phone?

788
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
Yep.

789
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,600
Bring, bring, bring, bring.

790
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,600
Yes, Julius.

791
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:58,600
First off, they know, they know the whole thing. And second off, Ruth, she knows that we're here. She saw your name on my phone.

792
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,600
Okay.

793
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,600
What do we do with her? I see her right now.

794
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,600
You have eyes on the target?

795
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,600
Yeah. And she might have eyes on us from what I saw.

796
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,600
Her eyes are crazy.

797
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,600
Hey, X. Hi, Cal, Colorado here. Also, uh, Beck has the numbers in him.

798
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:18,600
No, I, I just, it's like normal that you see 836 everywhere. Everybody, everybody sees it everywhere.

799
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:25,600
Well, that's, that's nothing that a bit of therapy can't fix. Mr. Colorado, I'm sure of it.

800
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
Good. You hear that, Beck?

801
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,600
Probably costs 836 bucks.

802
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,600
X, Cal, Colorado. How much does it cost?

803
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,600
Oh, I'm with your insurance. I, I've really, I have no idea.

804
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,600
If you had to guess.

805
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:45,600
I don't know. Maybe $80 for a session. Is that normal?

806
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,600
How many cents?

807
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,600
How many cents? What is that question?

808
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,600
How many cents?

809
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,600
I don't know how many cents. It would be whatever the...

810
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,600
Okay, well, so 80 bucks. That's, see, you just encountered some numbers that weren't the numbers.

811
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,600
Probably like a convenience charge for the card.

812
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,600
It's probably like $83 and 60 cents.

813
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,600
Maggie said she was messing with you.

814
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,600
I'm going to need you to like 836 that out of your brain, dude.

815
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
Shit.

816
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,600
What the fuck?

817
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,600
Has it always been like that?

818
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,600
836.

819
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,600
God damn it.

820
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
Yeah, 836.

821
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,600
Son of a bitch.

822
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
What do we do with her?

823
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,600
Lure her into the van with Adderall and then tie her up.

824
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,600
We could bring her to you. We could kill her. She knows.

825
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,600
Actually, though, Julius, like, we were pretty good in there.

826
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:37,600
Like, she just knows that we know about Brock, but we don't even really know about Brock.

827
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,600
And we kind of alluded to the fact that we don't know about Brock.

828
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,600
But she knows that we're not cowboys.

829
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,600
And she looked at me with both her eyes and looked at me bad.

830
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,600
She looked at me with both her eyes once. It wasn't...

831
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
How is she...

832
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,600
Into both my eyes.

833
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,600
How is she doing?

834
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,600
Not bad.

835
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,600
Not bad?

836
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,600
No. Yes, bad.

837
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
Yeah.

838
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,600
She tried to smoke meth in front of us at the bar. Inside.

839
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,600
Were there witnesses?

840
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,600
No.

841
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,600
Sort of. Like, you could call them witnesses, but at the Foundry, nobody's ever a witness.

842
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,600
Oh, you were at the Foundry.

843
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,600
Maggie, yeah. Maggie keeps her mouth shut.

844
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,600
But also, you know, she's...

845
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,600
It's a rough part of town. All sorts wander in.

846
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,600
I don't think Maggie took Ruth as anything particularly odd.

847
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,600
Okay. Well, what do you think we should do, Julius?

848
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,600
I don't know. I don't know.

849
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,600
I've got, uh, like, a vote.

850
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,600
I know I'm not, like, part of, like, your guys' club.

851
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,600
Well, you're in it now.

852
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,600
Let's just, like, let her twist in the wind for a while, and maybe she'll lead us to something that we can use.

853
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,600
I love it.

854
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,600
X, Cal, Colorado. What do we think about that?

855
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:50,600
I think it's time that Julius had a bit more agency, and so if he thinks that's a good idea, what do you think, Julius?

856
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,600
I like it. Beck, I got a question.

857
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,600
Do you have an air tag on any of your equipment in here?

858
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,600
Yeah.

859
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,600
I need one.

860
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,600
Sure. Give me a sec.

861
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,600
And he goes and grabs a spare air tag.

862
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,600
Okay. Give me an Adderall.

863
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,600
That's a Stevie prop.

864
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
Stevie, give me an Adderall.

865
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,600
Yeah, yeah. I see what you're doing.

866
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,600
He takes the air tag and the Adderall.

867
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,600
That's brilliant.

868
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:22,600
I drive over to Ruth, and Julius hops out, and he offers her an Adderall, and while she's looking at it, he just shoves the air tag down into her purse.

869
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,600
Oh, I thought you were going to tape the air tag to the Adderall.

870
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,600
Or swallow it.

871
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,600
They're noticeably bigger than an Adderall.

872
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,600
I know. That's why it's funny.

873
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:37,600
This is an extra large Adderall.

874
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:46,600
I hear Cal say that in the background, and he doesn't drop the air tag in, slaps it on, and swallow this right now.

875
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:51,600
Rubs it down her throat like a dog.

876
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:58,600
He does all that, so she's seen the Adderall without it, and he slaps it on, and makes it better.

877
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,600
It makes it better.

878
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,600
The kid told us, I don't know anything about it. She said it's what they're all doing.

879
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:07,600
Go persuade.

880
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,600
Forty on a sixty.

881
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,600
I'll do it.

882
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:16,600
Quick, you're running out of time.

883
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,600
Cowboy, and he does little finger guns at her.

884
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,600
Whoa, that was cool.

885
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,600
The kids call that a cow patty.

886
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:29,600
Throws it in her mouth, and is like, all right, thank you.

887
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,600
See ya, you know, around.

888
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:38,600
Beck, in the background, in the van, is doing finger guns in the air. Like a yee-haw, cowboy.

889
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:45,600
I don't condone the use of modern technologies to pursue journalism, but this was well done, boys. Very well done.

890
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:51,600
As he's about to get back in the van, he looks at her and goes, my name's Jim. Just Jim.

891
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:59,600
Remember, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

892
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:04,600
He's hoping that she'll focus on that and forget his real name, and he hops back in the van.

893
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:09,600
She laughs like I did and throws her hands over her mouth and is like, all right, bye.

894
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,600
What's my name?

895
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,600
Jim.

896
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,600
Yeah, bye. And he hops in the van and he's like, let's get the fuck out of here.

897
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,600
Let's go.

898
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,600
Beck, is it showing up on your phone? Is she tagged?

899
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,600
I've got a blip.

900
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,600
Holy fuck yeah.

901
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:28,600
We should have her for the next, I don't know, twelve to twenty-four hours.

902
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:34,600
I don't know. It might get stuck up in there. She's probably on some opioids too, so she, I don't know that she.

903
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,600
I didn't get a downers vibe from her.

904
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,600
They like to mix it sometimes, I don't know.

905
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:44,600
Even though your whole crew is, you're all kind of downers.

906
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:49,600
Well, I guess Brock's dead, so what do we do now?

907
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,600
We were going to meet.

908
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,600
Let's go see Kaylee.

909
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,600
We were going to meet up with Kaylee, but to ask her about what the residue does?

910
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:02,600
No, we just have the lead that Dr. Murray said that somebody at the Brock Hargrave site saw people trying to climb into somebody else.

911
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,600
And we know that Kaylee tried to do that, tried to climb into the other Kaylee.

912
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:14,600
Yeah, let's go see Kaylee. Like, she might, I don't know what kind of shit Hargrave had going on, but obviously it was something crazy.

913
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:19,600
Actually, Cal, to your point, yeah, we would probably ask her if she saw that residue since we found the residue at the Brock site.

914
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,600
Maybe that's the connection? We can find that out.

915
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:27,600
Or maybe she knew Hargrave and knows something else about it. Lived to tell the tale.

916
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,600
She came into contact with the stuff somehow, so.

917
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,600
I think we gotta go talk to her.

918
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,600
The stuff being the craziness, right?

919
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,600
She got the goggle in her.

920
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,600
I resent that, maybe. I don't know, fuck that name, whatever.

921
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,600
And then we'll find your dad.

922
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,600
Yeah, and you can kill your dad, Stevie.

923
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,600
I don't, still.

924
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,600
Come on, Stevie, everybody wants to kill their dad.

925
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,600
I don't know if I want to.

926
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,600
We'll kill him for you.

927
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,600
Oh, boy.

928
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:57,600
I think it's important that Stevie do this themselves.

929
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,600
You're right, you're right.

930
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,600
That's the full house ending.

931
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,600
Oh, boy.

932
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:09,600
Oh, boy.

933
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:16,600
Julius is gonna, like, look around in the van for, like, press passes and give the prison a call.

934
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,600
But he's not gonna do it on speakerphone.

935
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:23,600
And he's gonna whisper in the corner of the van while he does it.

936
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,600
Are you implying that you want us to leave?

937
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,600
I would, if it could be a private conversation.

938
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,600
You're calling the prison?

939
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,600
Yes.

940
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,600
To talk to Kaylee?

941
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:36,600
No, to tell them, like, heads up, we're coming in and want to talk to this prisoner.

942
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,600
Oh, okay.

943
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,600
What if it's not?

944
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,600
Yeah, why do you want to do that privately?

945
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,600
There's definitely a reason I want to do it privately.

946
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,600
But we'd still hear what you were saying.

947
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,600
Not if I'm in the corner super quiet.

948
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,600
Okay.

949
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,600
Real stealth.

950
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,600
And then you guys are all alertness.

951
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:58,600
And if you beat him, then you get to stay in the room.

952
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,600
How'd you do on stealth?

953
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:04,600
I failed a 41 on a 40 for my alertness.

954
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,600
I failed as well, though.

955
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,600
I got a six on alertness.

956
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:12,600
Okay, so Thomas gets to stay in the room.

957
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,600
That sucks.

958
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,600
I needed to pee.

959
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,600
Hey, can you guys put your headphones in?

960
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,600
What?

961
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,600
Yeah, dude, sure, no problem.

962
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,600
Yeah, Stevie immediately throws on headphones as well.

963
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,600
Yeah, sure, sure.

964
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,600
Headphones.

965
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,600
Boing, boing.

966
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,600
Boing, boing.

967
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,600
This is Officer Peeler.

968
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,600
Ooh, that's gonna be rough.

969
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,600
This is Officer Peeler.

970
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,600
This is at the city jail.

971
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,600
Yeah, I'm calling with Can News.

972
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:46,600
We need to schedule a couple interviews.

973
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,600
Yeah, okay.

974
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,600
Can News.

975
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:58,600
Shout out to Sindre from Norway for Officer Stu Peeler, who is red-faced and intense and

976
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:04,600
talks like he has to force every word out through his throat or like he's taking a shit.

977
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,600
Nailed it, Zach.

978
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,600
Thanks.

979
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,600
Thanks, Sindre.

980
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,600
S-I-N-D-R-E?

981
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,600
Sindre.

982
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,600
Sindre.

983
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,600
Sindre.

984
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,600
Sindre.

985
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,600
Which of the, um, which of the...

986
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,600
One from each.

987
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,600
What are their names?

988
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,600
Kaylee Silver and...

989
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,600
Uh, Burl Summers.

990
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,600
What was that?

991
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,600
Burl Summers.

992
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,600
Yeah, when will you be here?

993
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,600
Forty-five minutes.

994
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,600
Okay.

995
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,600
Get them ready for you.

996
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,600
May have to wait a little bit.

997
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,600
Maybe at the front.

998
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,600
I'm ready.

999
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,600
Thank you.

1000
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,600
Thanks.

1001
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,600
Hey, Julius.

1002
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,600
Yeah?

1003
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,600
Who's Burl Summers?

1004
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,600
Claire.

1005
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,600
He is.

1006
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,600
That did not work out well for you there, Luke.

1007
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,600
Uh-uh.

1008
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,600
You shouldn't have done personal business on cam time.

1009
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,600
On cam time!

1010
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:03,600
There's no secrets in the van, Julius.

1011
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:10,600
As Cal hollers something out from the front of the can van, Stevie and Beck both are kind

1012
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,600
of, like, startled and take off their headphones.

1013
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,600
Sorry, guys.

1014
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:17,600
I asked Julius, who's Burl Summers?

1015
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,600
Well, fuck.

1016
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,600
I just...

1017
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,600
I figured we're going to the prison and I got a family member in there that I figured

1018
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:29,600
I'd say hi to because I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to go back to the prison

1019
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:35,600
This seems dangerous and I might not ever get to see him again, so I just wanted to

1020
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,600
say hi while we talked to Kaylee.

1021
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,600
And he's, like, not looking at anybody, just kind of looking down.

1022
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,600
I don't understand, Julius.

1023
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,600
Is that, like, what's his relation to you?

1024
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,600
Well, it's my dad.

1025
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,600
Have you seen him since you've been kidnapped?

1026
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:58,600
Well, I mean, I guess I told you all about the firm and everything, so fuck it.

1027
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:05,600
And then you guys pull up to the city jail and prison.

1028
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:13,600
It is a complex here with a nice big visitor's office in the front with big concrete stairs

1029
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:19,600
that lead up to a couple different segments of double glass doors in the front.

1030
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:24,600
And there's just big concrete pillars on either side.

1031
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,600
We're here, but Julius, you weren't quite done with what you were saying.

1032
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:34,600
As Julius is getting ready to tell you, it flashes back to Julius getting abducted in

1033
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:42,600
the woods by the man with, like, one stringy long hair on his chin and crazy hair.

1034
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:49,600
And it cuts to that guy dragging Julius into the woods and then opening a bunker door and

1035
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:54,600
dragging him down and telling him that he's got to go get supplies and information.

1036
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,600
And then he locks the door behind him and leaves.

1037
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:01,600
So Julius is looking all around this, like, underground bunker for a way to get out.

1038
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:06,600
And he can't find a way out, but he finds this, like, library room that's filled with,

1039
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:12,600
like, monster books and, like, occult shit and just wild crazy shit.

1040
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:18,600
And he's, like, reading through some of it and he's, like, I've been abducted by a fucking maniac.

1041
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,600
And he, like, keeps looking around in the room and he moves a painting.

1042
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:27,600
And behind the painting is, like, a hollowed out area with two VHS tapes in it.

1043
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,600
So he finds the VCR and he shoves the first tape in.

1044
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:40,600
And it's, like, POV, like, handheld camera footage of a guy running through the woods

1045
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:44,600
holding this camera chasing, like, a big rat.

1046
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,600
And it's that for, like, 30 seconds.

1047
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:54,600
And then it immediately cuts to, like, a giant rat in a dog kennel and its face is, like, human.

1048
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,600
And it has big rat teeth.

1049
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:02,600
And the guy behind the camera is whispering it to it, like, can you talk?

1050
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,600
Hey, buddy, can you talk?

1051
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,600
Say something.

1052
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,600
Say something.

1053
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:12,600
And it goes on for a couple minutes and Julius at 16 years old is, like, freaking out

1054
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:16,600
and ejects the tape and puts the second tape in.

1055
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:20,600
And it's the same quality camera, still handheld.

1056
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,600
And the guy is, like, looks like it's kind of same pants and shoes and stuff.

1057
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,600
But this time it's in a hospital hallway.

1058
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:31,600
And Julius is watching and finally he's, like, running down the hallway

1059
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:35,600
and he gets into a room and he sees, like, a woman who is giving birth.

1060
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:43,600
And once the camera, like, kind of stops shaking, he sees that it's Julius' much younger mother.

1061
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:49,600
And the man behind the camera is, like, hey, honey, I just made it in time.

1062
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:53,600
And it's the same voice as the voice that was in the first VHS tape.

1063
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,600
Holy shit.

1064
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,600
And it cuts back to real life in Julius.

1065
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:02,600
That's absolutely wild.

1066
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,600
Yeah.

1067
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,600
What?

1068
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,600
So that happens for the audience.

1069
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:13,600
And then, yeah, Julius just goes, well, when I got kidnapped I had never met my father.

1070
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:17,600
He's the one that kidnapped me.

1071
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,600
Yeah.

1072
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:24,600
Yeah, so I'd never met my dad before I got taken in.

1073
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,600
And he's, yeah, he's the one that took me in.

1074
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:37,600
He'd been part of the firm since he found some kind of monster, like a rat, human, hybrid thing.

1075
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,600
A rat boy.

1076
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:43,600
They contacted him and he, I was, like, a year old when they made him leave.

1077
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:49,600
And he came back to get me and they offered me a spot and I took it, you know.

1078
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:55,600
I didn't see my mom a lot and I never knew my dad so I figured it'd be a good chance to get to know him.

1079
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:00,600
And we worked together basically my whole adult life and, yeah.

1080
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,600
What landed him here?

1081
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,600
Oh, a fucking job gone wrong.

1082
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:11,600
We were, we saw some crazy shit and we killed it and we had to, well, it was in a building and we burnt the building down.

1083
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,600
And cop Scott called and I got away and he didn't.

1084
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,600
He was a fall guy.

1085
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,600
Yeah, I guess.

1086
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,600
I haven't seen him since.

1087
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,600
How long ago was that rat man hybrid thing?

1088
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,600
I mean, shit, 28 years ago.

1089
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,600
The math checks out.

1090
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,600
What's going on with the rat man today?

1091
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,600
I mean, he never really got into it.

1092
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:41,600
It was just, he saw that out in the woods and he caught it and then he kind of fucking lost it and just was into conspiracy stuff and researching occult stuff.

1093
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:51,600
And I guess he must have found something because that's when the firm contacted him and said, you know, it's either work for us or, or nothing.

1094
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,600
Would you like to talk to him while we talk to Kaylee?

1095
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,600
I wanted to go see Kaylee.

1096
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:03,600
I was just going to tell him hi and speak my mind to him, you know, tell him what I've been thinking about him.

1097
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,600
And then I, you know, and then tell him I'll probably never see him again.

1098
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,600
We all know what we're getting into when we get into this.

1099
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,600
So it's just a nice little thing.

1100
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,600
I never thought I'd get to do it.

1101
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,600
Julius, that is nice.

1102
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,600
And I'm glad you don't want to kill your dad.

1103
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,600
No.

1104
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:23,600
You know, Hey, yeah, you're probably going to die, right?

1105
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:28,600
You're probably going to die, but, uh, if you don't, you'll almost certainly go to jail.

1106
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:35,600
Well, I mean, you might see your dad again, but, but also think about this, Julius, think about this.

1107
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:41,600
What if we sick thousands of rat men onto the creatures of Godel Gorge?

1108
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,600
I think please follow up with him about the rat man.

1109
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:50,600
I'll ask him, but I'm pretty sure that the rat man, I mean, he, they took the rat man away from him and just assigned him to go do other.

1110
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,600
Just ask if he, if he, if he ever learned anything more.

1111
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,600
I'll ask him, I'll see.

1112
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:59,600
Text X too. Rat men? Question mark?

1113
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,600
I mean, it sounds like the stuff we've already been working with, right?

1114
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,600
It's a, it's an animal man.

1115
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,600
Yeah. I mean, I'll, I'll ask him and see.

1116
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,600
But if this was like one of the first cases.

1117
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:13,600
It could have been the thing where I made up the backstory and didn't even put the two together.

1118
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:20,600
I thought it was, no, it sounded like a distinct type of man animal hybrid.

1119
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:24,600
I liked it. I think we could, we could mobilize the rat man.

1120
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,600
Yeah. We could easily find a way to tie this all in.

1121
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:31,600
Okay. So cut that last part out that I said.

1122
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:42,600
Yeah. I'll, I'll, I'll ask him about it. I, you know, I want to get in and learn with Kaylee Silver, but I'll, I'll just talk to him, you know, as soon as, unless they're both out there at the same time, you know.

1123
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,600
We'll definitely talk to him if there's time.

1124
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,600
Okay.

1125
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:54,600
And, and Julius, like, okay, let's go in. Let's go talk to Kaylee.

1126
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,600
Outside the steps. I'm like, back, back, get this one, get this one. Okay.

1127
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,600
Beck sets up.

1128
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:14,600
Cal kind of has his hands crossed out in front of them. Like they're about to be cuffed and he's like, I'm Cal, Colorado, and today I'm going to jail.

1129
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,600
Hell yeah.

1130
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,600
Nice.

1131
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:39,600
Also, let me plug in my computer.

1132
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,600
Plug it in, plug it in.

1133
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:44,600
Let me plug in real quick to my lungs.

1134
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,600
Whoa, sorry.

1135
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,600
You're good.

1136
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,600
Oh no.

1137
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:52,600
No, dude, these things, you can run them over, dude.

1138
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,600
And I do.

1139
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,600
I got to squeeze every last drop of juice out of those pods.

1140
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:01,600
Running over with your car like a toothpaste.

1141
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,600
Yeah.

1142
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:07,600
Here, don't let me run over your head, but tell me when it's coming out.

1143
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,600
Just give a good hard tap on the fender there.

1144
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,600
What about this? Puff it in, puff it in.

1145
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,600
That sounds good.

1146
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,600
Was that air fresh or what?

1147
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,600
Glade.

1148
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,600
Glade.

1149
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:23,600
What if it was, instead of Glade, it was vape and then it was puff it in, puff it in.

1150
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,600
You could do that in the same font for sure.

1151
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,600
Oh yeah, for sure.

1152
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,600
Oh, you could do that in the same font for sure.

1153
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,600
Oh yeah, for sure, dude.

1154
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,600
No doubt you could put that in the same font for sure.

1155
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,600
If you're buying a candle, what flavor are you buying?

1156
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,600
Fur.

1157
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,600
Ooh, yeah.

1158
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:36,600
For sure.

1159
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,600
Any tree scent.

1160
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,600
Sandalwood.

1161
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,600
Burning fur.

1162
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,600
Burning hair.

1163
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,600
I think if I see sandalwood.

1164
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,600
F-I-R.

1165
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,600
E, fire.

1166
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,600
Plus E or in parentheses.

1167
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,600
Minus eight.

1168
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,600
And if you divide that by the smell, then you get?

1169
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,600
Eight through six.

1170
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,600
Oh, shit.

1171
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,600
Yeah, roll.

1172
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,600
Roll back.

1173
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,600
Roll back.

1174
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,600
And it's all my fault.

1175
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,600
He shit his pants.

1176
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,600
I shit my pants.

1177
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,600
Zach shit his pants for real.

1178
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,600
Method acting.

1179
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,600
We're gonna have to spray down the pod room.

1180
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,600
It's all over the walls.

1181
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,600
It's gonna be tough to clean that out.

1182
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,600
You can tell your wife that you shit yourself on your podcast.

1183
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,600
For money.

1184
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,600
If you actually shit yourself, Zach looks crazy.

1185
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,600
If you actually shit yourself, I'm sorry.

1186
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,600
I've never shit myself before.

1187
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,600
Did you?

1188
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,600
I hope including now.

1189
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,600
Is your blood back in your head or out of it?

1190
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,600
Whatever happened?

1191
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,600
Taylor Zach shit himself.
