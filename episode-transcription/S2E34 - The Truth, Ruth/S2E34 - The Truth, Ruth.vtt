00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Salutations and hellos. It's your radio goddess, Wolf the Dog.

00:06.000 --> 00:15.000
I host this little old show y'all may enjoy at the radio station known as 694.2 PTBP.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
What do those numbers and letters stand for? I honestly have no idea.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
I used a random number and letter generator to make it.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
But what is not random is the intentional love y'all have sent our way.

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
This howlin' with Wolf is from Silvestri who tweeted about the show and tagged at PretendingPod on Twitter.

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
Which, don't even get old Wolfy started on that. I'll X a thread so fast you'll zuck your musk.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Anyway, tag us on the internet please.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Silvestri writes

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
to listen to all the bonus episodes.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
Now who is this Zach people keep speaking of?

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
And why does he spell his name like that?

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
What's so special about him?

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
I don't know. Maybe one day I'll get to meet this Zach.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Probably not though, I'm uh, I'm pretty busy.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Anyway, thanks for writing in.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
Next time if you could talk a little less about a Zach and a little more about a Wolf

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
that would be pretty nice of ya.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
If you want to write up something for your wolf to how,

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
tag at PretendingPod on Instagram threads or Twitter.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Tag users slash PretendingToBePeople on Reddit.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
Or write up a five star review on the podcast app of your choice.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
And get it in front of these here eyes of mine.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Oh, my favorite podcast app?

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
For reviews, it's definitely the Apple Podcast app.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
Writing out a five star review on Apple Podcast does wonders for us here at PTBP,

02:24.000 --> 02:32.000
which hopefully will allow us to continue broadcasting these wondrously terrible stories from 694.2,

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
the city's oldest and only radio station.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Whoa, what's that?

02:39.000 --> 02:47.000
You want to support the show financially in exchange for a wild amount of really dope fully edited bonus episodes?

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
The Patreon link is in the show notes.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
You want a shirt or a hat or a fanny pack or a beach towel?

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
That's so fun, I love that for you.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
The merch store link is in the show notes.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
You want to see all the links I tirelessly typed up to all of our shit?

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
Fucking bet, babies, the links are in the show notes.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
There, there, I know change is hard, but it's already time for the news.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
Last time, on episode 33, that's not Brock,

03:21.000 --> 03:29.000
Daddy ran away with the drone footage of the old timey gymnasium with the bloody throne under the basketball hoop.

03:29.000 --> 03:36.000
So they decided to head to the foundry, both for a drink and to hopefully meet up with Dr. Brock Hargrave.

03:36.000 --> 03:45.000
In the foundry's parking lot, Beck showed the team a clip of the Jaguar that jumped on the train over Godel's Gate to Grover's Gorge,

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
seemingly speaking as it slid down the side of the strange smooth chasm.

03:50.000 --> 03:58.000
Inside the foundry, the can crew was approached by a ghastly gaunt woman who called herself Elijah.

03:58.000 --> 04:06.000
It muttered about 836 under her breath while she openly discussed Dr. Hargrave and Dr. Murray

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
and her status as a cowboy before she attempted to smoke meth at the table.

04:11.000 --> 04:20.000
Taking us now to the foundry where Stevie is feeding this Elijah woman Adderall so she doesn't smoke methamphetamine in public,

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
it just feels so right.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
All my fault.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
What's he building in there?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
You know that song?

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Chocolate of course.

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
It's like chocolate of course. Of course.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I'll buy us IMAX tickets for that one.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
Oh gosh. Look how big the chocolate is.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
I thought he was going to redo Chocolat.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
That'd be better.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Timothy Chocolat.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
What other Johnny Depp movies could he do?

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
If Timothée Chalamet played...

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Rango?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
That'd be crazy.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
What was that movie? It was a book I think.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
The Rum Diaries?

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Fearing Loathing in Las Vegas.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Fearing Loathing in Las Vegas?

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Dude, but Timothée Chalamet in Leaving Las Vegas?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Do you think he could do it?

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Do you think he could do it?

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
He could do a pretty good job at it.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
After seeing the trailer to Wonka, you think that he could do it?

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
Yeah, I think it's not him being bad as the movie is bad.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
You know what? No shit. He would be a great What's Eating Gilbert Grape.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Yeah. The mom.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Or the grape.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
The grape.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Being grape of course.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Tell us what you're doing over there.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
From now on, when I think Timothée Chalamet, it'll be verbing of course.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Peabody Award.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
I think that's kind of how you say it.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Peabody?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Peabody.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Nah, say it in a British accent.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Peabody Award.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
The Peabody Award.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Sorry dude.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Were you just saying it in a British accent?

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
You guys are saying body so hard which is not how anybody says it.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Peabody.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Peabody.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Peabody.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Peabody.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Peabody. I think it's Peabody.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Peabody.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Peabody.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Peabody Award.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Peabody.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Peabody Award.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
This is the Peabody.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
The first annual Peabody's.

07:16.000 --> 07:23.000
For highest score on the turfs, has Cal won a Peabody Award?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Yeah, for sure.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
A what?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
A Peabody Award?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Peabody?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Peabody?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Peabody?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Peabody.

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
There were a couple websites that awarded him a Peabody Award but he wasn't really aware

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
of that.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Was he deserving?

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
I think it was more of a wish, like a wish that like buddies we'd like to pee with.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Oh, okay.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Yeah.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
A hundred percent.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
But he's also won a Peabody.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Yeah.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
It's like comedians in cars but it's journalists in bathrooms.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
We're gonna go check out this restaurant and spend a whole lot of time in their bathroom.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
And it's carpool karaoke so they sing in there too.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
A stall to stall interview.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Yeah, interview.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
You know what Julius has been talking to us about in the van?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Pitching.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
But like the thing is, you know, like on Hot Ones, they have to eat the wings.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
You have to take a shit during the interview.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
If you can't take a shit, they send a camera up there and find out what's going on.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
And like everyone in the comments like makes fun of you for like not taking and picking

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
up shit.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Dude, it's like we call it talking shit.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Shit talking.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Shit talking.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Taking the piss.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Lord took a shit like nobody else, dude.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
Who would the best shitter be, do you think?

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
What a weird joke.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
That's somebody who's watched a lot of Hot Ones.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
I think there would be different groups of fans who would want to see different kinds

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
of shit.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Because like best shit is pretty subjective.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Does it show the shit after they did it?

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
Oh yeah, there's a camera down there watching the shit go in.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
And so you're like, yeah, no ass, just shit.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
It's a perpendicular.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Yeah.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Did you see?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
It's tasteful, okay?

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
It's tasteful.

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
But some people like, I think if it's a more spectacular splash, that might do it for some

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
people.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
But you'll see a lot of people in the comment going like, eat fiber scrub.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
I personally would be more impressed by how much of a solid log can you get out before

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
it has to get pinched off?

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
Like how much of just a smoothie assembly line are you?

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
Because at that point you're showing off your sphincter.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Yeah.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
No, no, no, no, no.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
It's only a poop cam.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
No ass cam.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
No, no, no, no.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
I didn't mean, you're saying the power thereof to not cut it off.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Right.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Yeah.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Full relaxation.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
Do you think we've lost some listeners?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Yeah.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Did you see Obama went on talking shit?

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
They're getting big names, dude.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Oh my God.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
So smooth.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
I would choose George Bush though for that conversation.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
H.W. or W?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
W.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
W.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
I paint little Iraqi children.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Oh, that's the Onion article.

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
He's shitting and painting and interviewing and it's honestly, it's pretty cool.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
He talks about how he did 9-11.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
He's so, he's so plain and fast and loose in there.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
The scoops they get on talking shit.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Yeah.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
I wasn't like totally, I didn't totally know about it.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
I just, you know, I knew it was happening.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
If we decide that talking shit doesn't work for the intro, what could we pivot to here

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
roughly?

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
I think it's pretty good shit.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Yeah.

10:51.000 --> 10:57.000
And we're finished with it now and now we're starting episode 34 pretending to be people.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Welcome.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
The island of Dr. Insano.

11:03.000 --> 11:09.000
We have been learning some things and we are at the foundry and we are around a table.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
I feel like we've got a bunch more about to be learned.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
It shows, it's like you just unpaused it and it's Julius saying rock.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
I tell you what.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Okay.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
All right.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Calm down.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Calm down.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
So it was Elijah, right?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Can I call you Elijah?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
That's right.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
You can call me Ruth for sure.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Or wait, sorry.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
What?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Ruth.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Okay.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
I'll call you Ruth.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Whatever you want.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Yes.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
What made you want to meet with us?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
I forgot to ask you.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
I was going to ask you what you thought of Dr. Murray.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
You must've gotten a, how do you know?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
She's good.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
She's a doctor.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
They're all kind of like that.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
But like personality wise, what do you, what do you think about her?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Well, it doesn't really matter.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
We're talking about one doctor, you know?

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
No, just like whether or not she's a disciplined and good person.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
I mean, she helped us.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
Do you think you're a disciplined and good person?

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
She growls as she looks across the table.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
You were about to go smoke meth.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Smoke meth.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
I do what needs to be done for this country.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Are you willing to do the same?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Meth?

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Just, I just have to stop it.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
He got caught.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
He got caught.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
He got caught.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
He got caught.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
It's just, it's going to get everyone, you know?

12:39.000 --> 12:46.000
Cause we're all just considered as sheep to be slaughtered at this point, you know?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
So it is, it's fine.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
He got caught by the 836.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
He got caught by the 836.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
What does that mean?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
What is the 836?

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000
I don't, I don't know exactly, but I did know that if water is measured in cubic feet and

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
it's built in units of a hundred cubic feet, okay?

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
A hundred cubic feet, HCF, HCF, 836.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
It's, it's holy cow farms.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
It's, it's the eighth letter of the alphabet, the third letter of the alphabet, and the

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
sixth letter of the alphabet, HCF.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
The milk place?

13:16.000 --> 13:23.000
Which is equal, yes, to 748 gallons of water or milk, thank you.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
And if you start at eight, 748 gallons, right?

13:26.000 --> 13:30.600
So if you start at eight, go backwards and you have a four minus one is three and a seven

13:30.600 --> 13:36.800
minus one is six, uh, 836 and if you take both of those negative ones together and the

13:36.800 --> 13:42.100
minus cancel out and then you get plus 11, which if you do that eight times to the original

13:42.100 --> 13:52.340
number of 748, you get Butter Cook.

13:52.340 --> 13:56.040
Say it with me, 836.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.040
That's right.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.600
She points at Julius again.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.600
Wait, 11 times 748?

14:00.600 --> 14:02.600
Yeah, that last part I don't think had to have come.

14:02.600 --> 14:03.600
That didn't work.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.600
No, you multiply the 11 times 8 and add it.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.600
What's your name?

14:07.600 --> 14:08.600
Julius.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.600
Julius knows what I'm talking about.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.600
Okay.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.600
She's making a lot of sense.

14:12.600 --> 14:13.600
Yeah.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.600
It sounds like you've got this all figured out.

14:15.600 --> 14:19.600
I mean, you were talking earlier about something wild.

14:19.600 --> 14:22.600
I mean, it sounds like you saw something wild too.

14:22.600 --> 14:26.600
I just saw a dead man, a pair of legs of a man named Jimmy Corrigan.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.600
Like that stupid comic book?

14:29.600 --> 14:31.600
I don't know nothing about it.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.600
My daughter, she made me read it.

14:33.600 --> 14:34.600
It's very sad.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.600
So who, do you guys know who Jimmy Corrigan is?

14:37.600 --> 14:38.600
No.

14:38.600 --> 14:39.600
What?

14:39.600 --> 14:42.600
He's an American patriot who lost his top half.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.600
At the same time as Brock?

14:44.600 --> 14:45.600
Yes, lost his life.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.600
How did Brock know him?

14:47.600 --> 14:53.600
I may have sent Jimmy to go looking for...

14:53.600 --> 15:02.600
And at that moment you see all the TVs in the foundry all cut to CNN for breaking news.

15:02.600 --> 15:07.600
Pan News Network.

15:07.600 --> 15:12.600
9-11-2.

15:12.600 --> 15:19.600
Finally you see all the TVs flashing breaking news across the bottom of each of the screens

15:19.600 --> 15:24.600
and your eyes inadvertently go to the screen showing can.

15:24.600 --> 15:28.600
Julius is saying, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.

15:28.600 --> 15:35.600
And a seemingly rushed Isabella Caya is kind of getting herself together as the camera

15:35.600 --> 15:41.600
goes live on her and she says, yeah, yeah, yes, yes, yes, yes, hello.

15:41.600 --> 15:51.600
To everyone in the city, I do have some heartbreaking news for you.

15:51.600 --> 15:57.600
American tycoon, Fred Godel is dead.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.600
Cal looks over at Stevie.

15:59.600 --> 16:09.600
Stevie is stunned, shocked, mouth slightly ajar with like amazement, astonishment, confusion.

16:09.600 --> 16:15.600
Maybe, maybe some of your brother still is in there.

16:15.600 --> 16:23.600
My, my, it's like their ears are just like ringing and they're just looking down and

16:23.600 --> 16:30.600
they started kind of stumbling up from their chair and walk across the foundry to the bathroom.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.600
Do you think it got old?

16:32.600 --> 16:34.600
Hey, Maggie, can you turn that up?

16:34.600 --> 16:42.600
We are, um, just now getting word that Godel company has put out a statement about the

16:42.600 --> 16:49.600
passing of Fred Godel Monday night.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.600
That's counting on his fingers.

16:51.600 --> 16:52.600
Just told his notes.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.600
They're going to find out how many days this was.

16:54.600 --> 17:00.600
Yesterday was Thursday, Monday, July 4th, 2022.

17:00.600 --> 17:11.600
And at that moment, each of you starts thinking to yourself, Oh my God, did I miss the 4th of July?

17:11.600 --> 17:15.600
You saw Fred Godel after that.

17:15.600 --> 17:19.600
He was at a gas station on the road as we were departing Godel's gorge.

17:19.600 --> 17:21.600
Shit.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.600
Wait, who realizes it?

17:23.600 --> 17:25.600
All of us at the same time.

17:25.600 --> 17:26.600
Wait a minute.

17:26.600 --> 17:29.600
Are you guys thinking what I'm thinking?

17:29.600 --> 17:31.600
Say it all together now.

17:31.600 --> 17:39.600
We saw Fred Godel after he left.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.600
After he's supposed to have died.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.600
So he couldn't be dead.

17:43.600 --> 17:44.600
He's not dead?

17:44.600 --> 17:45.600
He's not dead, Stevie.

17:45.600 --> 17:46.600
Wait.

17:46.600 --> 17:47.600
No, that's Elijah.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.600
I'm not Stevie.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.600
You guys, dude, he sounds kind of similar.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.600
I thought Stevie had come back.

17:52.600 --> 17:53.600
I do go by many names.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.600
Julius, yell at Stevie again.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.600
Stevie!

17:56.600 --> 17:58.600
Stevie, Stevie, come back.

17:58.600 --> 17:59.600
He's not dead.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.600
We probably have to kill him.

18:01.600 --> 18:05.600
Or at least capture him.

18:05.600 --> 18:06.600
Contain.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.600
Maim.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.600
It's like good news, bad news sort of for everything in general for you.

18:10.600 --> 18:15.600
Yeah, I know they probably felt a lot of complicated feelings when you heard about the death of

18:15.600 --> 18:16.600
your father.

18:16.600 --> 18:19.600
I know I sure did, but he's not really dead.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.600
You still have to kill him.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.600
Your mission is not finished.

18:22.600 --> 18:27.600
You don't need to process stuff now, but later you will for sure.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.600
This is like a good practice for that.

18:29.600 --> 18:34.600
Hey, Ruth, cover your ears.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.600
No.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.600
Fuck.

18:38.600 --> 18:43.600
I don't have any money.

18:43.600 --> 18:48.600
As he reaches out to me.

18:48.600 --> 18:50.600
She goes, do you have a vape on you?

18:50.600 --> 18:52.600
Do we need anything else from her?

18:52.600 --> 18:53.600
I mean, I feel like we need a lot of stuff.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.600
What is your deal, dude?

18:56.600 --> 18:58.600
Are you here to get to the bottom of this?

18:58.600 --> 18:59.600
Yes.

18:59.600 --> 19:00.600
We want to find out the truth.

19:00.600 --> 19:01.600
We're the news.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.600
Ruth.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.600
Oh, nice.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.600
Cal, good one.

19:04.600 --> 19:05.600
Thank you.

19:05.600 --> 19:06.600
You can't deny the dog.

19:06.600 --> 19:07.600
You can't deny the dog.

19:07.600 --> 19:08.600
Not as good.

19:08.600 --> 19:09.600
There.

19:09.600 --> 19:10.600
You can't deny the rhyme.

19:10.600 --> 19:16.600
She's looking at you, Cal, with one eye and the other one is searching your chin, your

19:16.600 --> 19:17.600
mouth.

19:18.600 --> 19:24.600
Yeah, he's got the same sort of facial situation as you.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.600
Who's that, then?

19:26.600 --> 19:31.600
Does this person literally have independent motion of eyes?

19:31.600 --> 19:34.600
Or is that just a fun way to describe the way Googly-

19:34.600 --> 19:36.600
It's just a fun way to describe her disability.

19:36.600 --> 19:37.600
You're not fucking sure.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.600
I nudge Julius.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.600
Julius, remember that joke about being a chameleon?

19:42.600 --> 19:44.600
Look at those eyes.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.600
We're talking about animal people and shit.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.600
What do chameleons like to eat?

19:48.600 --> 19:50.600
Oh, like flies, right?

19:50.600 --> 19:51.600
Bugs.

19:51.600 --> 19:52.600
Yeah.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.600
There sure are a lot of bugs in here.

19:53.600 --> 19:54.600
Have you noticed that?

19:54.600 --> 19:55.600
A lot of bar flies.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.600
A lot of bar flies.

19:57.600 --> 19:58.600
Guys, shut up.

19:58.600 --> 19:59.600
What do you think about the bugs in here?

19:59.600 --> 20:04.600
Okay, let me just step away from the game real quick and ask you a question about how

20:04.600 --> 20:06.600
you want season two to go.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.600
Yeah.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.600
We wanted to be a chameleon lady.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.600
Duh.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.600
We want chameleon, of course.

20:25.600 --> 20:26.600
The whole time.

20:30.600 --> 20:31.600
In both arcs.

20:31.600 --> 20:38.600
All I'm saying is that my house address is 8 Oak Avenue.

20:38.600 --> 20:45.600
8 is the first number, and Oak is three letters, and Avenue is also three letters, or six letters.

20:45.600 --> 20:46.600
So that's 836.

20:46.600 --> 20:49.600
And also, them, what are they calling them?

20:49.600 --> 20:50.600
Lightning tornadoes?

20:50.600 --> 20:52.600
They're leaving those smooth holes in the ground everywhere?

20:52.600 --> 20:53.600
Yeah, what about them?

20:53.600 --> 20:58.600
They're occurring at the exact opposite side of the world every four hours and 18 minutes

20:58.600 --> 20:59.600
from when they hit.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.600
And what's the circumference of one of those circles?

21:01.600 --> 21:02.600
Hitting another random location.

21:02.600 --> 21:05.600
Actually, I think that might be it.

21:05.600 --> 21:11.600
Two minutes and nine seconds later, or maybe those seconds add up to some sort of time

21:11.600 --> 21:12.600
unit that's 836.

21:12.600 --> 21:13.600
836.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.600
I wrote it down for a reason, but it's another one of my 836.

21:16.600 --> 21:17.600
836.

21:17.600 --> 21:18.600
Is that your house?

21:18.600 --> 21:19.600
836.

21:19.600 --> 21:20.600
Yeah, 836.

21:20.600 --> 21:21.600
What?

21:21.600 --> 21:22.600
Is that your house?

21:22.600 --> 21:23.600
It's just 836.

21:23.600 --> 21:24.600
What?

21:24.600 --> 21:25.600
This is at your house?

21:25.600 --> 21:26.600
836.

21:26.600 --> 21:27.600
What?

21:27.600 --> 21:28.600
You wrote this down.

21:28.600 --> 21:29.600
Yeah.

21:29.600 --> 21:30.600
That's at your house.

21:30.600 --> 21:31.600
836.

21:31.600 --> 21:32.600
What?

21:32.600 --> 21:33.600
Do you have it in an email or something?

21:33.600 --> 21:34.600
Could you just forward that to us?

21:34.600 --> 21:35.600
Do you fax?

21:35.600 --> 21:36.600
I love to fax.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.600
Thomas' eyes lit up.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.600
Oh my God.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.600
He's so happy.

21:43.600 --> 21:47.600
Thomas is so in character.

21:47.600 --> 21:50.600
Count like four.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.600
It starts to write down the...

21:52.600 --> 21:53.600
What do you think?

21:53.600 --> 21:54.600
Oh, yeah.

21:54.600 --> 21:57.600
Let me give you the can, the fax number, okay?

21:57.600 --> 21:58.600
Okay.

21:58.600 --> 21:59.600
It's 836.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.600
Son of a bitch.

22:01.600 --> 22:02.600
Look at that.

22:02.600 --> 22:03.600
It's everywhere.

22:03.600 --> 22:04.600
Look at that.

22:04.600 --> 22:05.600
Look at that.

22:05.600 --> 22:06.600
It's everywhere.

22:06.600 --> 22:07.600
Look at that.

22:07.600 --> 22:08.600
Look at that.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.600
So it's the area code for the city.

22:10.600 --> 22:11.600
That's all it is?

22:11.600 --> 22:13.600
All our phone numbers start with 836.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.600
Yeah, but is it more?

22:15.600 --> 22:16.600
Hey, Maggie.

22:16.600 --> 22:19.600
How much is old fashioned with tax?

22:19.600 --> 22:20.600
Why do you want to know?

22:20.600 --> 22:22.600
It's like seven something maybe.

22:22.600 --> 22:23.600
Fuck.

22:23.600 --> 22:24.600
Oh, close.

22:24.600 --> 22:25.600
It was close.

22:25.600 --> 22:26.600
And then she punches it in.

22:26.600 --> 22:28.600
After tax, it's 836.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.600
Holy shit.

22:30.600 --> 22:31.600
What is this?

22:31.600 --> 22:33.600
The fucking Truman Show?

22:33.600 --> 22:35.600
We do always have a camera on us.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.600
Everybody roll grip.

22:44.600 --> 22:45.600
Yeah, that's a failure.

22:45.600 --> 22:46.600
I fail.

22:46.600 --> 22:47.600
I fail as well.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.600
Well, perfect.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.600
Then we get a little group madness here.

22:51.600 --> 22:57.600
Why don't you tell us exactly what the fuck is going on here, chameleon lady?

22:57.600 --> 22:59.600
She never answered the fly question.

22:59.600 --> 23:02.600
You eat flies, don't you?

23:02.600 --> 23:04.600
And Stevie walks out of the bathroom.

23:04.600 --> 23:05.600
He's not dead.

23:05.600 --> 23:06.600
Your dad's not dead.

23:06.600 --> 23:07.600
You still have to kill him.

23:07.600 --> 23:11.600
This woman's a fucking chameleon.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.600
She stands up and backs away.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.600
And she's like, I'm not a chameleon.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.600
I'm not a chameleon.

23:17.600 --> 23:23.600
My mouth is dry from the amphetamines or whatever I was given by your friend.

23:23.600 --> 23:28.600
And I'm not a chameleon.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.600
Okay, Stevie.

23:30.600 --> 23:32.600
She may or may not be a chameleon.

23:32.600 --> 23:33.600
Yeah?

23:33.600 --> 23:35.600
Wait, did you say my dad's not dead?

23:35.600 --> 23:36.600
Your dad's not dead, Stevie.

23:36.600 --> 23:37.600
We saw him.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.600
We saw him after he was supposed to have died.

23:39.600 --> 23:40.600
On the way back from the gorge.

23:40.600 --> 23:41.600
At the gas station.

23:41.600 --> 23:42.600
At the gas station.

23:42.600 --> 23:43.600
Wait, when did they say he died?

23:43.600 --> 23:44.600
That doesn't mean-

23:44.600 --> 23:45.600
July 4th.

23:45.600 --> 23:46.600
Okay.

23:46.600 --> 23:48.600
8 minus 3 is 6.

24:01.600 --> 24:12.600
Okay, just because they said that he died on a different day doesn't mean he's not dead.

24:12.600 --> 24:14.600
But that is good, I guess.

24:14.600 --> 24:15.600
What's his birthday?

24:15.600 --> 24:17.600
I think we already did this bit.

24:17.600 --> 24:20.600
Because I said August 36th.

24:20.600 --> 24:21.600
Perfect.

24:21.600 --> 24:22.600
Fuck.

24:24.600 --> 24:25.600
It's coming up everywhere.

24:25.600 --> 24:28.600
Zach, I need to know how much sand I lost.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.600
Yeah.

24:29.600 --> 24:31.600
By the way, you all just lose one grip for that.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.600
That's what, yeah.

24:32.600 --> 24:33.600
I'm sorry.

24:33.600 --> 24:34.600
How dare you apologize.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.600
That hits me right smack onto my breaking point.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.600
Do you break then?

24:38.600 --> 24:41.600
Oh, that's fortuitous.

24:41.600 --> 24:44.600
I mean, Luke and Thomas can leave the room if they want, but I think we all know what

24:44.600 --> 24:45.600
your mania's gonna be.

24:45.600 --> 24:46.600
Oh, yeah.

24:46.600 --> 24:51.600
He's got the numbers in him.

24:51.600 --> 24:53.600
Life is a circle.

24:53.600 --> 24:56.600
Becky's got the numbers in him.

24:56.600 --> 24:58.600
Oh, boy.

24:58.600 --> 25:01.600
Is it so it's not a phobia, it's a mania?

25:01.600 --> 25:03.600
Oh, I guess that's up to you.

25:03.600 --> 25:06.600
You can do whichever one you want and you don't have to tell any of us.

25:06.600 --> 25:07.600
You can just do it.

25:07.600 --> 25:08.600
Okay.

25:08.600 --> 25:09.600
I bet we'll figure it out real quick.

25:09.600 --> 25:10.600
Real quick.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.600
It's either ah or ooh.

25:12.600 --> 25:16.600
What do you guys think it's gonna be?

25:16.600 --> 25:18.600
Oh, I think it's gonna be ooh.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.600
I think it's gonna be ooh.

25:20.600 --> 25:21.600
Interesting.

25:21.600 --> 25:22.600
Maggie, Maggie.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.600
Are you just fucking with us?

25:24.600 --> 25:25.600
About what?

25:25.600 --> 25:26.600
The price.

25:26.600 --> 25:27.600
Yeah.

25:28.600 --> 25:32.600
Well, at least that didn't do any serious mental damage.

25:36.600 --> 25:39.600
And a joke that does no harm is all good.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.600
All on fun, right, Beck?

25:41.600 --> 25:47.600
Yeah, I mean, if it was actually fucking with us, it could have been 836.

25:47.600 --> 25:50.600
In fact, I bet it fucking was 836.

25:50.600 --> 25:52.600
That's what I'm talking about.

25:52.600 --> 25:53.600
Yeah, right there.

25:53.600 --> 25:54.600
That fire.

25:54.600 --> 25:55.600
You ready to join up?

25:55.600 --> 25:56.600
You ready to do this?

25:59.600 --> 26:00.600
Octopus.

26:00.600 --> 26:01.600
Tripod.

26:01.600 --> 26:02.600
Spider.

26:02.600 --> 26:03.600
Yes.

26:03.600 --> 26:04.600
Holy shit!

26:04.600 --> 26:05.600
Yep.

26:05.600 --> 26:06.600
Holy shit!

26:06.600 --> 26:07.600
Yep.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.600
What's it mean?

26:08.600 --> 26:09.600
That's exactly right.

26:09.600 --> 26:10.600
Spiders have...

26:10.600 --> 26:11.600
I'm talking like you now.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.600
It's hard not to hear.

26:13.600 --> 26:14.600
It's a fun voice.

26:14.600 --> 26:15.600
Spiders have eight legs.

26:15.600 --> 26:16.600
Oh, phew.

26:16.600 --> 26:17.600
That's 838.

26:17.600 --> 26:18.600
Okay.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.600
But most insects have six legs.

26:20.600 --> 26:21.600
Oh shit!

26:21.600 --> 26:22.600
Ah!

26:24.600 --> 26:25.600
Holy shit!

26:25.600 --> 26:26.600
Almost any bug.

26:26.600 --> 26:28.600
Anything you'd consider a bug, really.

26:28.600 --> 26:29.600
It's everywhere.

26:29.600 --> 26:30.600
It's all around us.

26:30.600 --> 26:38.600
Julius is going to text X, do we know Ruth slash Elijah, and like snap a pic.

26:38.600 --> 26:40.600
Like kind of like just above the table.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.600
It flashes and like...

26:43.600 --> 26:46.600
Yeah, roll stealth.

26:46.600 --> 26:49.600
Ooh, 42 and a 40.

26:49.600 --> 26:50.600
What was that?

26:50.600 --> 26:51.600
Why'd you do that?

26:51.600 --> 26:52.600
Oops.

26:52.600 --> 26:53.600
And he hits it.

26:54.600 --> 26:55.600
Oops.

26:55.600 --> 26:56.600
Give me that phone.

26:56.600 --> 26:57.600
No way.

26:57.600 --> 26:58.600
Give me that.

26:58.600 --> 26:59.600
Give me that.

26:59.600 --> 27:07.600
Yeah, he's going to defend himself harder than he needs to.

27:07.600 --> 27:11.600
Okay, 54 on a 60.

27:11.600 --> 27:16.600
No, 79 on a 70.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.600
She rips away your phone from you and...

27:19.600 --> 27:22.600
He pulls his gun out and points it at her.

27:22.600 --> 27:23.600
All right, everybody.

27:23.600 --> 27:24.600
Calm down.

27:24.600 --> 27:25.600
Uh oh.

27:25.600 --> 27:26.600
Uh oh.

27:26.600 --> 27:27.600
Hey.

27:27.600 --> 27:28.600
Give me back my phone or I'll fucking kill you.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.600
Uh, Beck is kind of looking around.

27:30.600 --> 27:32.600
We're just doing a play.

27:32.600 --> 27:33.600
We're just acting out a play.

27:33.600 --> 27:39.600
Maggie rings the bell and says, hey, put that fucking gun down.

27:39.600 --> 27:42.600
Yeah, Julius, don't pull a gun in Maggie's bar and hey, you know, if you want our friend

27:42.600 --> 27:47.600
Stevie to give you some more of their Adderall, maybe you should give Julius his phone back.

27:47.600 --> 27:52.600
He like slowly starts to lower the gun but is like reaching his hand out, like expecting

27:52.600 --> 27:54.600
her to meet with the phone.

27:54.600 --> 27:58.600
What is the number for X listed in your phone?

27:58.600 --> 28:03.600
It's under Diggory, not X because no one actually calls her X.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.600
That is the X-Files, right?

28:06.600 --> 28:08.600
Right.

28:08.600 --> 28:11.600
She scolded her.

28:11.600 --> 28:12.600
Barely knew her.

28:12.600 --> 28:16.600
Um, it's under Diggory because that's how he was introduced.

28:16.600 --> 28:21.600
As she hands the phone back to you, she like turns it facing herself.

28:21.600 --> 28:23.600
So she's like looking at the text.

28:23.600 --> 28:26.600
Julius grabs it as quick as he can out of her hand.

28:26.600 --> 28:28.600
Huh.

28:28.600 --> 28:31.600
She's got one eye on you and the other eye on you.

28:31.600 --> 28:32.600
Guys, we need to go.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.600
Julius starts heading towards the door.

28:34.600 --> 28:35.600
But it's our news bar.

28:35.600 --> 28:36.600
She should go.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.600
As Julius is walking away.

28:38.600 --> 28:41.600
Julius is also texting X, uh, she knows.

28:41.600 --> 28:50.600
She's hollering at him and she says, uh, it's a big world, Julius.

28:50.600 --> 28:51.600
Fuck.

28:51.600 --> 28:53.600
Which side are you on?

28:53.600 --> 28:55.600
Julius leaves the foundry.

28:55.600 --> 29:00.600
As Beck is leaving, he wants to say, and uh, you got Cal's fax number.

29:00.600 --> 29:03.600
I'd love to see some of that information on the 836 you've gathered.

29:03.600 --> 29:13.600
Yes, we are the sheep, but if we all are aware of the machine that is doing the slaughtering,

29:13.600 --> 29:16.600
can we not rise?

29:16.600 --> 29:18.600
Can you?

29:18.600 --> 29:21.600
Maybe.

29:21.600 --> 29:22.600
Hmm.

29:22.600 --> 29:23.600
You want to be the sheep.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.600
I'm confused.

29:25.600 --> 29:26.600
We can rise.

29:26.600 --> 29:27.600
Can sheep go upstairs?

29:27.600 --> 29:29.600
How many more than cows?

29:29.600 --> 29:30.600
I think they can't look up.

29:30.600 --> 29:31.600
Is that right?

29:31.600 --> 29:33.600
Texas dogs can't look up.

29:33.600 --> 29:37.600
How many, uh, how many more of them pills you got there?

29:37.600 --> 29:42.600
Stevie Cal gets between Stevie and uh, and Ruth.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.600
Now we're just going to back away.

29:44.600 --> 29:51.600
Stevie's going to lay down one more 10 milligram instant release Adderall right there, right there on the floor.

29:51.600 --> 29:53.600
And we're all just going to back away.

29:53.600 --> 29:56.600
And you're going to pick that up and you're going to leave Maggie's bar.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.600
We're going to leave it too.

29:58.600 --> 30:02.600
And then you can have your little X-Files war or whatever. I don't know.

30:02.600 --> 30:11.600
And as you slowly start backing away, she reaches down slowly, keeping eye on you.

30:11.600 --> 30:14.600
Both picks up the pill.

30:14.600 --> 30:21.600
And as you leave, I think you guys are probably at the parking lot and you see her leave.

30:21.600 --> 30:22.600
Bye, Ruth.

30:22.600 --> 30:23.600
Like in her car?

30:23.600 --> 30:24.600
No, leave the bar.

30:24.600 --> 30:27.600
Oh.

30:27.600 --> 30:31.600
She waves.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.600
Guys, it's Ruth.

30:33.600 --> 30:37.600
Julius is like pacing back and forth and like just looking at his phone waiting for a response.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.600
She has some really good ideas about things.

30:39.600 --> 30:43.600
Julius, can you tell us what the fuck is going on with your little cowboy club or whatever?

30:43.600 --> 30:48.600
Yeah, I'll tell you in a little bit, but it's imperative that she does not know where we're going.

30:48.600 --> 30:53.600
We didn't tell her about the footage that we have. She cannot know about that.

30:53.600 --> 30:54.600
They don't want it out.

30:54.600 --> 30:55.600
Who's, who's?

30:55.600 --> 30:57.600
She's the bad guys. I'm the good guys.

30:57.600 --> 31:00.600
Who's in charge and who's rebelling?

31:00.600 --> 31:05.600
There's a lot of details. I know what Diggory tells me and what-

31:05.600 --> 31:06.600
You don't-

31:06.600 --> 31:07.600
Diggory?

31:07.600 --> 31:10.600
You don't know, you don't know who's, you don't know who's anything.

31:10.600 --> 31:16.600
I know that it exists and I know that you just, you follow orders and that's, that's what I know.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.600
It's what I've known for years.

31:18.600 --> 31:21.600
Do you know who those cowboys she mentioned are?

31:21.600 --> 31:23.600
He does two thumbs to himself.

31:23.600 --> 31:24.600
Oh, you're a cowboy?

31:24.600 --> 31:25.600
Yeehaw.

31:25.600 --> 31:28.600
But she thinks they're the cowboys. You're all cowboys?

31:28.600 --> 31:31.600
She thinks that Dr. Murray is no longer a cowboy, right?

31:31.600 --> 31:36.600
He doesn't do two thumbs to himself. He does two fingers over to Ruth.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.600
And you're Diggory?

31:45.600 --> 31:46.600
X.

31:46.600 --> 31:47.600
X.

31:47.600 --> 31:50.600
Here's what I know. I take orders from her now.

31:50.600 --> 31:56.600
Before that, I took orders from someone else since I was a teen.

31:56.600 --> 32:00.600
That's all I've done and I never questioned it. I never needed to.

32:00.600 --> 32:04.600
I just knew you do what they tell you and you're going to be okay.

32:04.600 --> 32:08.600
And you get to find out so much.

32:08.600 --> 32:11.600
You get to find out so much.

32:11.600 --> 32:14.600
Cow like puts his hands on your shoulders and he says,

32:14.600 --> 32:17.600
Yeah, but you see, you're a can man now.

32:17.600 --> 32:23.600
You take your orders from me. We're the ones who find out so much.

32:23.600 --> 32:26.600
You've got to admit, we've been finding out a lot.

32:26.600 --> 32:30.600
Julius just about loses his mind, like...

32:30.600 --> 32:33.600
Come with us, son. We'll tell you what to do.

32:33.600 --> 32:37.600
Okay, I've got to tell you everything just so that like...

32:37.600 --> 32:38.600
We're all on the same page.

32:38.600 --> 32:45.600
Yeah, because if I just go with you guys, it's not going to be safe for any of us.

32:45.600 --> 32:48.600
Okay, why don't you tell us what you know?

32:48.600 --> 32:55.600
Well, when, you know, when I was 16, I got taken into the firm and...

32:55.600 --> 32:57.600
By that scary guy, right? That you told us about?

32:57.600 --> 32:59.600
Oh shit, she's still here. Oh, sorry, Stevie.

32:59.600 --> 33:04.600
No, yeah, it's me. I have a much gravelier and like upper register voice.

33:04.600 --> 33:07.600
I thought it was Ruth, too.

33:07.600 --> 33:11.600
Whereas the other ones, less gravelly and lower and a little southern.

33:11.600 --> 33:14.600
But I'll try to change them even more in the future.

33:14.600 --> 33:15.600
What did they say?

33:15.600 --> 33:18.600
No, they're distinct. It's just...

33:18.600 --> 33:21.600
You were taken by the firm when you were 16?

33:21.600 --> 33:27.600
Yeah, I got... Well, initially I got taken, but yeah, I like joined up with them and...

33:27.600 --> 33:33.600
I mean, literally since I was 16, I've been doing this like 13 years. I've fallen the orders.

33:33.600 --> 33:35.600
Wait, what's the wildest thing you've ever done?

33:35.600 --> 33:38.600
Yeah, what's the wackiest thing you've done for these guys?

33:38.600 --> 33:40.600
Well, I'll tell you wacky.

33:40.600 --> 33:42.600
Wild, too. And then Beck, what do you want to...

33:42.600 --> 33:47.600
Scary. Just like real quick, you know, just like super easy.

33:47.600 --> 33:50.600
Come up with three really complicated things for us.

33:50.600 --> 33:51.600
Well, like...

33:51.600 --> 33:52.600
Whole new stories.

33:52.600 --> 34:01.600
My old handler and I, we had to like dig up a whole graveyard of people to like inspect them to make sure...

34:01.600 --> 34:04.600
So that's the wacky one.

34:04.600 --> 34:11.600
Well, and then like the cops came because someone saw us digging up every single body we dug up.

34:11.600 --> 34:15.600
Well, scariest was when the cops showed up and there was like 10 of them.

34:15.600 --> 34:20.600
And then I guess like the worst thing was after me and my handler killed all 10 of them.

34:20.600 --> 34:27.600
And then we had to bury all the bodies plus 10 more back after we looked at all the dead bodies.

34:27.600 --> 34:32.600
And we didn't even find what we were looking for. So it sucked, too. So that's your answer.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.600
Whoa. Knocked out all three in one.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.600
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

34:36.600 --> 34:41.600
Although after that, like it was not hard to kill any more people. It was not hard at all.

34:41.600 --> 34:43.600
I imagine it wasn't.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.600
It was kind of fun sometimes.

34:45.600 --> 34:46.600
Oh, no.

34:46.600 --> 34:48.600
Okay. Yeah.

34:48.600 --> 34:49.600
You got to...

34:49.600 --> 34:50.600
Not every time.

34:50.600 --> 34:57.600
When you share a newsman with a van, you need to know his deepest secrets and now you do.

34:57.600 --> 35:01.600
You share a newsman with a van?

35:02.600 --> 35:03.600
Luke, do you have luck?

35:03.600 --> 35:04.600
No.

35:04.600 --> 35:05.600
Yeah, you do.

35:05.600 --> 35:06.600
Oh, hell yeah.

35:06.600 --> 35:07.600
Good job.

35:07.600 --> 35:08.600
Nice.

35:08.600 --> 35:09.600
Yeah, that was awesome.

35:09.600 --> 35:16.600
All of that to like say, I know that the shit that I got told to do was almost always dangerous.

35:16.600 --> 35:24.600
Someone almost always got hurt. And the people above the person above me, there's a person above them.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.600
And it just gets worse the higher up you go.

35:27.600 --> 35:35.600
And if we piss them off, it's not going to be good. And we're already, we don't agree on how to run things or they don't.

35:35.600 --> 35:39.600
And so they're going to be dangerous now.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.600
Which side has more power, yours or theirs?

35:41.600 --> 35:43.600
I mean, it's hard to say, but theirs.

35:43.600 --> 35:47.600
No, it's hard to say. It's hard to say, but ours.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.600
That seems harder.

35:51.600 --> 35:53.600
Like the non-messed out ones?

35:53.600 --> 35:55.600
Well, they're not all met well.

35:57.600 --> 35:59.600
And he thinks, yeah.

36:01.600 --> 36:02.600
Wow.

36:02.600 --> 36:03.600
Son of a bitch.

36:03.600 --> 36:11.600
But here's the deal, like the footage that we have, my team, we want to show it. We need to get it out there. Their team?

36:11.600 --> 36:13.600
Wants to put the kibosh on it.

36:13.600 --> 36:14.600
Exactly.

36:14.600 --> 36:15.600
So we're leaning your team.

36:16.600 --> 36:23.600
Right. Um, yeah. So what I'm saying is like, we got to stick with our guys. If, if we got to break off from them, we should wait.

36:23.600 --> 36:30.600
And then we got to be prepared. If we, if they tell us to do something that we don't want to do, it's gonna, they're going to know quick.

36:30.600 --> 36:31.600
They're everywhere.

36:31.600 --> 36:34.600
Stevie puts their hand on Julius's shoulder.

36:34.600 --> 36:43.600
Hey man, uh, I know that it's, uh, it's hard to kind of break away from something that you've always known, but I think you're making the right call.

36:43.600 --> 36:51.600
Well, thank you. Well, I mean, you made a good point and you guys are like the only people I've loved since my last handler.

36:51.600 --> 36:57.600
And like, uh, I don't think I have any of that love left at where I am.

36:57.600 --> 37:04.600
We do. We do love you, Julius. We're a family here at Cannes, but you're going to protect that family.

37:04.600 --> 37:09.600
Yeah, it's going to be dangerous though. But is Ruth, where's Ruth at, at this point?

37:09.600 --> 37:18.600
I mean, you guys got into the can van and just kind of watched Ruth walk around, do some circles.

37:18.600 --> 37:21.600
There's not like a car that she went to or anything.

37:21.600 --> 37:26.600
No, uh, she just walked down the street and then kind of disappears in the distance.

37:26.600 --> 37:28.600
Peeking behind a trash can, waiting for us to come out.

37:28.600 --> 37:37.600
Cal, run her over. Or, or let me. Or I could just shoot her. But then they'll, fuck, I wish X would text me back.

37:37.600 --> 37:39.600
Don't, don't, don't run her over. Just let her be.

37:39.600 --> 37:41.600
What if we brought her to X?

37:41.600 --> 37:44.600
Julius is going to call X.

37:44.600 --> 37:45.600
Speak your phone?

37:45.600 --> 37:46.600
Yep.

37:46.600 --> 37:48.600
Bring, bring, bring, bring.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.600
Yes, Julius.

37:49.600 --> 37:58.600
First off, they know, they know the whole thing. And second off, Ruth, she knows that we're here. She saw your name on my phone.

37:58.600 --> 37:59.600
Okay.

37:59.600 --> 38:00.600
What do we do with her? I see her right now.

38:00.600 --> 38:02.600
You have eyes on the target?

38:02.600 --> 38:06.600
Yeah. And she might have eyes on us from what I saw.

38:06.600 --> 38:07.600
Her eyes are crazy.

38:07.600 --> 38:11.600
Hey, X. Hi, Cal, Colorado here. Also, uh, Beck has the numbers in him.

38:11.600 --> 38:18.600
No, I, I just, it's like normal that you see 836 everywhere. Everybody, everybody sees it everywhere.

38:18.600 --> 38:25.600
Well, that's, that's nothing that a bit of therapy can't fix. Mr. Colorado, I'm sure of it.

38:25.600 --> 38:26.600
Good. You hear that, Beck?

38:26.600 --> 38:28.600
Probably costs 836 bucks.

38:29.600 --> 38:33.600
X, Cal, Colorado. How much does it cost?

38:33.600 --> 38:38.600
Oh, I'm with your insurance. I, I've really, I have no idea.

38:38.600 --> 38:40.600
If you had to guess.

38:40.600 --> 38:45.600
I don't know. Maybe $80 for a session. Is that normal?

38:45.600 --> 38:46.600
How many cents?

38:46.600 --> 38:48.600
How many cents? What is that question?

38:48.600 --> 38:50.600
How many cents?

38:50.600 --> 38:53.600
I don't know how many cents. It would be whatever the...

38:53.600 --> 38:57.600
Okay, well, so 80 bucks. That's, see, you just encountered some numbers that weren't the numbers.

38:57.600 --> 39:00.600
Probably like a convenience charge for the card.

39:00.600 --> 39:03.600
It's probably like $83 and 60 cents.

39:03.600 --> 39:05.600
Maggie said she was messing with you.

39:05.600 --> 39:09.600
I'm going to need you to like 836 that out of your brain, dude.

39:09.600 --> 39:10.600
Shit.

39:10.600 --> 39:11.600
What the fuck?

39:11.600 --> 39:13.600
Has it always been like that?

39:13.600 --> 39:14.600
836.

39:14.600 --> 39:15.600
God damn it.

39:15.600 --> 39:16.600
Yeah, 836.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.600
Son of a bitch.

39:20.600 --> 39:21.600
What do we do with her?

39:22.600 --> 39:26.600
Lure her into the van with Adderall and then tie her up.

39:26.600 --> 39:29.600
We could bring her to you. We could kill her. She knows.

39:29.600 --> 39:32.600
Actually, though, Julius, like, we were pretty good in there.

39:32.600 --> 39:37.600
Like, she just knows that we know about Brock, but we don't even really know about Brock.

39:37.600 --> 39:40.600
And we kind of alluded to the fact that we don't know about Brock.

39:40.600 --> 39:42.600
But she knows that we're not cowboys.

39:42.600 --> 39:46.600
And she looked at me with both her eyes and looked at me bad.

39:46.600 --> 39:49.600
She looked at me with both her eyes once. It wasn't...

39:49.600 --> 39:50.600
How is she...

39:50.600 --> 39:51.600
Into both my eyes.

39:51.600 --> 39:53.600
How is she doing?

39:53.600 --> 39:54.600
Not bad.

39:54.600 --> 39:55.600
Not bad?

39:55.600 --> 39:57.600
No. Yes, bad.

39:57.600 --> 39:58.600
Yeah.

39:58.600 --> 40:01.600
She tried to smoke meth in front of us at the bar. Inside.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.600
Were there witnesses?

40:04.600 --> 40:05.600
No.

40:05.600 --> 40:09.600
Sort of. Like, you could call them witnesses, but at the Foundry, nobody's ever a witness.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.600
Oh, you were at the Foundry.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.600
Maggie, yeah. Maggie keeps her mouth shut.

40:13.600 --> 40:15.600
But also, you know, she's...

40:15.600 --> 40:17.600
It's a rough part of town. All sorts wander in.

40:17.600 --> 40:20.600
I don't think Maggie took Ruth as anything particularly odd.

40:20.600 --> 40:24.600
Okay. Well, what do you think we should do, Julius?

40:26.600 --> 40:28.600
I don't know. I don't know.

40:28.600 --> 40:30.600
I've got, uh, like, a vote.

40:30.600 --> 40:33.600
I know I'm not, like, part of, like, your guys' club.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.600
Well, you're in it now.

40:35.600 --> 40:39.600
Let's just, like, let her twist in the wind for a while, and maybe she'll lead us to something that we can use.

40:39.600 --> 40:40.600
I love it.

40:40.600 --> 40:43.600
X, Cal, Colorado. What do we think about that?

40:43.600 --> 40:50.600
I think it's time that Julius had a bit more agency, and so if he thinks that's a good idea, what do you think, Julius?

40:50.600 --> 40:52.600
I like it. Beck, I got a question.

40:52.600 --> 40:55.600
Do you have an air tag on any of your equipment in here?

40:55.600 --> 40:56.600
Yeah.

40:56.600 --> 40:57.600
I need one.

40:57.600 --> 40:58.600
Sure. Give me a sec.

40:58.600 --> 41:00.600
And he goes and grabs a spare air tag.

41:00.600 --> 41:01.600
Okay. Give me an Adderall.

41:01.600 --> 41:02.600
That's a Stevie prop.

41:02.600 --> 41:03.600
Stevie, give me an Adderall.

41:03.600 --> 41:05.600
Yeah, yeah. I see what you're doing.

41:05.600 --> 41:09.600
He takes the air tag and the Adderall.

41:09.600 --> 41:10.600
That's brilliant.

41:10.600 --> 41:22.600
I drive over to Ruth, and Julius hops out, and he offers her an Adderall, and while she's looking at it, he just shoves the air tag down into her purse.

41:22.600 --> 41:25.600
Oh, I thought you were going to tape the air tag to the Adderall.

41:25.600 --> 41:29.600
Or swallow it.

41:29.600 --> 41:31.600
They're noticeably bigger than an Adderall.

41:31.600 --> 41:32.600
I know. That's why it's funny.

41:32.600 --> 41:37.600
This is an extra large Adderall.

41:37.600 --> 41:46.600
I hear Cal say that in the background, and he doesn't drop the air tag in, slaps it on, and swallow this right now.

41:46.600 --> 41:51.600
Rubs it down her throat like a dog.

41:51.600 --> 41:58.600
He does all that, so she's seen the Adderall without it, and he slaps it on, and makes it better.

41:58.600 --> 41:59.600
It makes it better.

41:59.600 --> 42:02.600
The kid told us, I don't know anything about it. She said it's what they're all doing.

42:02.600 --> 42:07.600
Go persuade.

42:07.600 --> 42:08.600
Forty on a sixty.

42:08.600 --> 42:10.600
I'll do it.

42:10.600 --> 42:16.600
Quick, you're running out of time.

42:16.600 --> 42:19.600
Cowboy, and he does little finger guns at her.

42:19.600 --> 42:21.600
Whoa, that was cool.

42:21.600 --> 42:23.600
The kids call that a cow patty.

42:23.600 --> 42:29.600
Throws it in her mouth, and is like, all right, thank you.

42:29.600 --> 42:31.600
See ya, you know, around.

42:31.600 --> 42:38.600
Beck, in the background, in the van, is doing finger guns in the air. Like a yee-haw, cowboy.

42:38.600 --> 42:45.600
I don't condone the use of modern technologies to pursue journalism, but this was well done, boys. Very well done.

42:45.600 --> 42:51.600
As he's about to get back in the van, he looks at her and goes, my name's Jim. Just Jim.

42:51.600 --> 42:59.600
Remember, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

42:59.600 --> 43:04.600
He's hoping that she'll focus on that and forget his real name, and he hops back in the van.

43:04.600 --> 43:09.600
She laughs like I did and throws her hands over her mouth and is like, all right, bye.

43:09.600 --> 43:10.600
What's my name?

43:10.600 --> 43:11.600
Jim.

43:11.600 --> 43:14.600
Yeah, bye. And he hops in the van and he's like, let's get the fuck out of here.

43:14.600 --> 43:15.600
Let's go.

43:15.600 --> 43:18.600
Beck, is it showing up on your phone? Is she tagged?

43:18.600 --> 43:19.600
I've got a blip.

43:19.600 --> 43:22.600
Holy fuck yeah.

43:22.600 --> 43:28.600
We should have her for the next, I don't know, twelve to twenty-four hours.

43:28.600 --> 43:34.600
I don't know. It might get stuck up in there. She's probably on some opioids too, so she, I don't know that she.

43:34.600 --> 43:36.600
I didn't get a downers vibe from her.

43:36.600 --> 43:38.600
They like to mix it sometimes, I don't know.

43:38.600 --> 43:44.600
Even though your whole crew is, you're all kind of downers.

43:44.600 --> 43:49.600
Well, I guess Brock's dead, so what do we do now?

43:49.600 --> 43:50.600
We were going to meet.

43:50.600 --> 43:51.600
Let's go see Kaylee.

43:51.600 --> 43:55.600
We were going to meet up with Kaylee, but to ask her about what the residue does?

43:55.600 --> 44:02.600
No, we just have the lead that Dr. Murray said that somebody at the Brock Hargrave site saw people trying to climb into somebody else.

44:02.600 --> 44:06.600
And we know that Kaylee tried to do that, tried to climb into the other Kaylee.

44:06.600 --> 44:14.600
Yeah, let's go see Kaylee. Like, she might, I don't know what kind of shit Hargrave had going on, but obviously it was something crazy.

44:14.600 --> 44:19.600
Actually, Cal, to your point, yeah, we would probably ask her if she saw that residue since we found the residue at the Brock site.

44:19.600 --> 44:22.600
Maybe that's the connection? We can find that out.

44:22.600 --> 44:27.600
Or maybe she knew Hargrave and knows something else about it. Lived to tell the tale.

44:27.600 --> 44:30.600
She came into contact with the stuff somehow, so.

44:30.600 --> 44:32.600
I think we gotta go talk to her.

44:32.600 --> 44:34.600
The stuff being the craziness, right?

44:34.600 --> 44:35.600
She got the goggle in her.

44:35.600 --> 44:39.600
I resent that, maybe. I don't know, fuck that name, whatever.

44:39.600 --> 44:40.600
And then we'll find your dad.

44:40.600 --> 44:42.600
Yeah, and you can kill your dad, Stevie.

44:42.600 --> 44:43.600
I don't, still.

44:43.600 --> 44:46.600
Come on, Stevie, everybody wants to kill their dad.

44:46.600 --> 44:49.600
I don't know if I want to.

44:49.600 --> 44:50.600
We'll kill him for you.

44:50.600 --> 44:52.600
Oh, boy.

44:52.600 --> 44:57.600
I think it's important that Stevie do this themselves.

44:57.600 --> 44:59.600
You're right, you're right.

44:59.600 --> 45:02.600
That's the full house ending.

45:02.600 --> 45:04.600
Oh, boy.

45:04.600 --> 45:09.600
Oh, boy.

45:09.600 --> 45:16.600
Julius is gonna, like, look around in the van for, like, press passes and give the prison a call.

45:16.600 --> 45:18.600
But he's not gonna do it on speakerphone.

45:18.600 --> 45:23.600
And he's gonna whisper in the corner of the van while he does it.

45:23.600 --> 45:25.600
Are you implying that you want us to leave?

45:25.600 --> 45:28.600
I would, if it could be a private conversation.

45:28.600 --> 45:29.600
You're calling the prison?

45:29.600 --> 45:30.600
Yes.

45:30.600 --> 45:31.600
To talk to Kaylee?

45:31.600 --> 45:36.600
No, to tell them, like, heads up, we're coming in and want to talk to this prisoner.

45:36.600 --> 45:38.600
Oh, okay.

45:38.600 --> 45:39.600
What if it's not?

45:39.600 --> 45:40.600
Yeah, why do you want to do that privately?

45:40.600 --> 45:43.600
There's definitely a reason I want to do it privately.

45:43.600 --> 45:45.600
But we'd still hear what you were saying.

45:45.600 --> 45:48.600
Not if I'm in the corner super quiet.

45:48.600 --> 45:49.600
Okay.

45:49.600 --> 45:50.600
Real stealth.

45:50.600 --> 45:52.600
And then you guys are all alertness.

45:52.600 --> 45:58.600
And if you beat him, then you get to stay in the room.

45:58.600 --> 46:00.600
How'd you do on stealth?

46:00.600 --> 46:04.600
I failed a 41 on a 40 for my alertness.

46:04.600 --> 46:05.600
I failed as well, though.

46:05.600 --> 46:07.600
I got a six on alertness.

46:07.600 --> 46:12.600
Okay, so Thomas gets to stay in the room.

46:12.600 --> 46:13.600
That sucks.

46:13.600 --> 46:16.600
I needed to pee.

46:16.600 --> 46:19.600
Hey, can you guys put your headphones in?

46:19.600 --> 46:20.600
What?

46:20.600 --> 46:22.600
Yeah, dude, sure, no problem.

46:22.600 --> 46:25.600
Yeah, Stevie immediately throws on headphones as well.

46:25.600 --> 46:27.600
Yeah, sure, sure.

46:27.600 --> 46:28.600
Headphones.

46:28.600 --> 46:29.600
Boing, boing.

46:29.600 --> 46:30.600
Boing, boing.

46:30.600 --> 46:32.600
This is Officer Peeler.

46:32.600 --> 46:35.600
Ooh, that's gonna be rough.

46:35.600 --> 46:38.600
This is Officer Peeler.

46:38.600 --> 46:41.600
This is at the city jail.

46:41.600 --> 46:42.600
Yeah, I'm calling with Can News.

46:42.600 --> 46:46.600
We need to schedule a couple interviews.

46:46.600 --> 46:47.600
Yeah, okay.

46:47.600 --> 46:48.600
Can News.

46:48.600 --> 46:58.600
Shout out to Sindre from Norway for Officer Stu Peeler, who is red-faced and intense and

46:58.600 --> 47:04.600
talks like he has to force every word out through his throat or like he's taking a shit.

47:04.600 --> 47:06.600
Nailed it, Zach.

47:06.600 --> 47:07.600
Thanks.

47:07.600 --> 47:08.600
Thanks, Sindre.

47:08.600 --> 47:09.600
S-I-N-D-R-E?

47:09.600 --> 47:10.600
Sindre.

47:10.600 --> 47:11.600
Sindre.

47:11.600 --> 47:12.600
Sindre.

47:12.600 --> 47:13.600
Sindre.

47:13.600 --> 47:16.600
Which of the, um, which of the...

47:16.600 --> 47:17.600
One from each.

47:17.600 --> 47:18.600
What are their names?

47:18.600 --> 47:20.600
Kaylee Silver and...

47:20.600 --> 47:22.600
Uh, Burl Summers.

47:22.600 --> 47:24.600
What was that?

47:24.600 --> 47:25.600
Burl Summers.

47:25.600 --> 47:27.600
Yeah, when will you be here?

47:27.600 --> 47:28.600
Forty-five minutes.

47:28.600 --> 47:29.600
Okay.

47:29.600 --> 47:30.600
Get them ready for you.

47:30.600 --> 47:32.600
May have to wait a little bit.

47:32.600 --> 47:34.600
Maybe at the front.

47:34.600 --> 47:35.600
I'm ready.

47:35.600 --> 47:36.600
Thank you.

47:36.600 --> 47:37.600
Thanks.

47:37.600 --> 47:38.600
Hey, Julius.

47:38.600 --> 47:39.600
Yeah?

47:39.600 --> 47:41.600
Who's Burl Summers?

47:41.600 --> 47:42.600
Claire.

47:42.600 --> 47:43.600
He is.

47:48.600 --> 47:50.600
That did not work out well for you there, Luke.

47:50.600 --> 47:51.600
Uh-uh.

47:51.600 --> 47:54.600
You shouldn't have done personal business on cam time.

47:54.600 --> 47:58.600
On cam time!

47:58.600 --> 48:03.600
There's no secrets in the van, Julius.

48:03.600 --> 48:10.600
As Cal hollers something out from the front of the can van, Stevie and Beck both are kind

48:10.600 --> 48:12.600
of, like, startled and take off their headphones.

48:12.600 --> 48:13.600
Sorry, guys.

48:13.600 --> 48:17.600
I asked Julius, who's Burl Summers?

48:17.600 --> 48:19.600
Well, fuck.

48:19.600 --> 48:21.600
I just...

48:21.600 --> 48:25.600
I figured we're going to the prison and I got a family member in there that I figured

48:25.600 --> 48:29.600
I'd say hi to because I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to go back to the prison

48:29.600 --> 48:35.600
This seems dangerous and I might not ever get to see him again, so I just wanted to

48:35.600 --> 48:37.600
say hi while we talked to Kaylee.

48:37.600 --> 48:40.600
And he's, like, not looking at anybody, just kind of looking down.

48:40.600 --> 48:42.600
I don't understand, Julius.

48:42.600 --> 48:45.600
Is that, like, what's his relation to you?

48:45.600 --> 48:48.600
Well, it's my dad.

48:48.600 --> 48:50.600
Have you seen him since you've been kidnapped?

48:50.600 --> 48:58.600
Well, I mean, I guess I told you all about the firm and everything, so fuck it.

48:59.600 --> 49:05.600
And then you guys pull up to the city jail and prison.

49:05.600 --> 49:13.600
It is a complex here with a nice big visitor's office in the front with big concrete stairs

49:13.600 --> 49:19.600
that lead up to a couple different segments of double glass doors in the front.

49:19.600 --> 49:24.600
And there's just big concrete pillars on either side.

49:25.600 --> 49:28.600
We're here, but Julius, you weren't quite done with what you were saying.

49:28.600 --> 49:34.600
As Julius is getting ready to tell you, it flashes back to Julius getting abducted in

49:34.600 --> 49:42.600
the woods by the man with, like, one stringy long hair on his chin and crazy hair.

49:42.600 --> 49:49.600
And it cuts to that guy dragging Julius into the woods and then opening a bunker door and

49:49.600 --> 49:54.600
dragging him down and telling him that he's got to go get supplies and information.

49:54.600 --> 49:56.600
And then he locks the door behind him and leaves.

49:56.600 --> 50:01.600
So Julius is looking all around this, like, underground bunker for a way to get out.

50:01.600 --> 50:06.600
And he can't find a way out, but he finds this, like, library room that's filled with,

50:06.600 --> 50:12.600
like, monster books and, like, occult shit and just wild crazy shit.

50:12.600 --> 50:18.600
And he's, like, reading through some of it and he's, like, I've been abducted by a fucking maniac.

50:18.600 --> 50:22.600
And he, like, keeps looking around in the room and he moves a painting.

50:22.600 --> 50:27.600
And behind the painting is, like, a hollowed out area with two VHS tapes in it.

50:27.600 --> 50:31.600
So he finds the VCR and he shoves the first tape in.

50:31.600 --> 50:40.600
And it's, like, POV, like, handheld camera footage of a guy running through the woods

50:40.600 --> 50:44.600
holding this camera chasing, like, a big rat.

50:44.600 --> 50:46.600
And it's that for, like, 30 seconds.

50:46.600 --> 50:54.600
And then it immediately cuts to, like, a giant rat in a dog kennel and its face is, like, human.

50:54.600 --> 50:56.600
And it has big rat teeth.

50:56.600 --> 51:02.600
And the guy behind the camera is whispering it to it, like, can you talk?

51:02.600 --> 51:04.600
Hey, buddy, can you talk?

51:04.600 --> 51:05.600
Say something.

51:05.600 --> 51:06.600
Say something.

51:06.600 --> 51:12.600
And it goes on for a couple minutes and Julius at 16 years old is, like, freaking out

51:12.600 --> 51:16.600
and ejects the tape and puts the second tape in.

51:16.600 --> 51:20.600
And it's the same quality camera, still handheld.

51:20.600 --> 51:24.600
And the guy is, like, looks like it's kind of same pants and shoes and stuff.

51:24.600 --> 51:27.600
But this time it's in a hospital hallway.

51:27.600 --> 51:31.600
And Julius is watching and finally he's, like, running down the hallway

51:31.600 --> 51:35.600
and he gets into a room and he sees, like, a woman who is giving birth.

51:35.600 --> 51:43.600
And once the camera, like, kind of stops shaking, he sees that it's Julius' much younger mother.

51:43.600 --> 51:49.600
And the man behind the camera is, like, hey, honey, I just made it in time.

51:49.600 --> 51:53.600
And it's the same voice as the voice that was in the first VHS tape.

51:53.600 --> 51:55.600
Holy shit.

51:55.600 --> 51:58.600
And it cuts back to real life in Julius.

51:58.600 --> 52:02.600
That's absolutely wild.

52:02.600 --> 52:03.600
Yeah.

52:03.600 --> 52:04.600
What?

52:04.600 --> 52:06.600
So that happens for the audience.

52:06.600 --> 52:13.600
And then, yeah, Julius just goes, well, when I got kidnapped I had never met my father.

52:13.600 --> 52:17.600
He's the one that kidnapped me.

52:17.600 --> 52:19.600
Yeah.

52:19.600 --> 52:24.600
Yeah, so I'd never met my dad before I got taken in.

52:24.600 --> 52:27.600
And he's, yeah, he's the one that took me in.

52:27.600 --> 52:37.600
He'd been part of the firm since he found some kind of monster, like a rat, human, hybrid thing.

52:37.600 --> 52:38.600
A rat boy.

52:38.600 --> 52:43.600
They contacted him and he, I was, like, a year old when they made him leave.

52:43.600 --> 52:49.600
And he came back to get me and they offered me a spot and I took it, you know.

52:49.600 --> 52:55.600
I didn't see my mom a lot and I never knew my dad so I figured it'd be a good chance to get to know him.

52:55.600 --> 53:00.600
And we worked together basically my whole adult life and, yeah.

53:00.600 --> 53:02.600
What landed him here?

53:02.600 --> 53:04.600
Oh, a fucking job gone wrong.

53:04.600 --> 53:11.600
We were, we saw some crazy shit and we killed it and we had to, well, it was in a building and we burnt the building down.

53:11.600 --> 53:14.600
And cop Scott called and I got away and he didn't.

53:14.600 --> 53:15.600
He was a fall guy.

53:15.600 --> 53:17.600
Yeah, I guess.

53:17.600 --> 53:18.600
I haven't seen him since.

53:18.600 --> 53:21.600
How long ago was that rat man hybrid thing?

53:22.600 --> 53:25.600
I mean, shit, 28 years ago.

53:25.600 --> 53:27.600
The math checks out.

53:27.600 --> 53:29.600
What's going on with the rat man today?

53:29.600 --> 53:31.600
I mean, he never really got into it.

53:31.600 --> 53:41.600
It was just, he saw that out in the woods and he caught it and then he kind of fucking lost it and just was into conspiracy stuff and researching occult stuff.

53:41.600 --> 53:51.600
And I guess he must have found something because that's when the firm contacted him and said, you know, it's either work for us or, or nothing.

53:51.600 --> 53:54.600
Would you like to talk to him while we talk to Kaylee?

53:54.600 --> 53:56.600
I wanted to go see Kaylee.

53:56.600 --> 54:03.600
I was just going to tell him hi and speak my mind to him, you know, tell him what I've been thinking about him.

54:03.600 --> 54:07.600
And then I, you know, and then tell him I'll probably never see him again.

54:07.600 --> 54:10.600
We all know what we're getting into when we get into this.

54:10.600 --> 54:12.600
So it's just a nice little thing.

54:12.600 --> 54:14.600
I never thought I'd get to do it.

54:14.600 --> 54:15.600
Julius, that is nice.

54:15.600 --> 54:18.600
And I'm glad you don't want to kill your dad.

54:18.600 --> 54:19.600
No.

54:19.600 --> 54:23.600
You know, Hey, yeah, you're probably going to die, right?

54:23.600 --> 54:28.600
You're probably going to die, but, uh, if you don't, you'll almost certainly go to jail.

54:28.600 --> 54:35.600
Well, I mean, you might see your dad again, but, but also think about this, Julius, think about this.

54:35.600 --> 54:41.600
What if we sick thousands of rat men onto the creatures of Godel Gorge?

54:41.600 --> 54:43.600
I think please follow up with him about the rat man.

54:43.600 --> 54:50.600
I'll ask him, but I'm pretty sure that the rat man, I mean, he, they took the rat man away from him and just assigned him to go do other.

54:50.600 --> 54:53.600
Just ask if he, if he, if he ever learned anything more.

54:53.600 --> 54:54.600
I'll ask him, I'll see.

54:54.600 --> 54:59.600
Text X too. Rat men? Question mark?

54:59.600 --> 55:02.600
I mean, it sounds like the stuff we've already been working with, right?

55:02.600 --> 55:04.600
It's a, it's an animal man.

55:04.600 --> 55:06.600
Yeah. I mean, I'll, I'll ask him and see.

55:06.600 --> 55:08.600
But if this was like one of the first cases.

55:08.600 --> 55:13.600
It could have been the thing where I made up the backstory and didn't even put the two together.

55:13.600 --> 55:20.600
I thought it was, no, it sounded like a distinct type of man animal hybrid.

55:20.600 --> 55:24.600
I liked it. I think we could, we could mobilize the rat man.

55:24.600 --> 55:26.600
Yeah. We could easily find a way to tie this all in.

55:26.600 --> 55:31.600
Okay. So cut that last part out that I said.

55:31.600 --> 55:42.600
Yeah. I'll, I'll, I'll ask him about it. I, you know, I want to get in and learn with Kaylee Silver, but I'll, I'll just talk to him, you know, as soon as, unless they're both out there at the same time, you know.

55:42.600 --> 55:44.600
We'll definitely talk to him if there's time.

55:44.600 --> 55:45.600
Okay.

55:45.600 --> 55:54.600
And, and Julius, like, okay, let's go in. Let's go talk to Kaylee.

55:54.600 --> 55:57.600
Outside the steps. I'm like, back, back, get this one, get this one. Okay.

55:57.600 --> 55:58.600
Beck sets up.

55:58.600 --> 56:14.600
Cal kind of has his hands crossed out in front of them. Like they're about to be cuffed and he's like, I'm Cal, Colorado, and today I'm going to jail.

56:14.600 --> 56:15.600
Hell yeah.

56:15.600 --> 56:16.600
Nice.

56:28.600 --> 56:39.600
Also, let me plug in my computer.

56:39.600 --> 56:40.600
Plug it in, plug it in.

56:40.600 --> 56:44.600
Let me plug in real quick to my lungs.

56:44.600 --> 56:45.600
Whoa, sorry.

56:45.600 --> 56:46.600
You're good.

56:46.600 --> 56:47.600
Oh no.

56:47.600 --> 56:52.600
No, dude, these things, you can run them over, dude.

56:52.600 --> 56:53.600
And I do.

56:53.600 --> 56:57.600
I got to squeeze every last drop of juice out of those pods.

56:57.600 --> 57:01.600
Running over with your car like a toothpaste.

57:01.600 --> 57:02.600
Yeah.

57:02.600 --> 57:07.600
Here, don't let me run over your head, but tell me when it's coming out.

57:07.600 --> 57:10.600
Just give a good hard tap on the fender there.

57:10.600 --> 57:13.600
What about this? Puff it in, puff it in.

57:13.600 --> 57:14.600
That sounds good.

57:14.600 --> 57:16.600
Was that air fresh or what?

57:16.600 --> 57:17.600
Glade.

57:17.600 --> 57:18.600
Glade.

57:18.600 --> 57:23.600
What if it was, instead of Glade, it was vape and then it was puff it in, puff it in.

57:23.600 --> 57:25.600
You could do that in the same font for sure.

57:25.600 --> 57:26.600
Oh yeah, for sure.

57:26.600 --> 57:28.600
Oh, you could do that in the same font for sure.

57:28.600 --> 57:29.600
Oh yeah, for sure, dude.

57:29.600 --> 57:31.600
No doubt you could put that in the same font for sure.

57:31.600 --> 57:33.600
If you're buying a candle, what flavor are you buying?

57:33.600 --> 57:34.600
Fur.

57:34.600 --> 57:35.600
Ooh, yeah.

57:35.600 --> 57:36.600
For sure.

57:36.600 --> 57:37.600
Any tree scent.

57:37.600 --> 57:38.600
Sandalwood.

57:38.600 --> 57:39.600
Burning fur.

57:39.600 --> 57:40.600
Burning hair.

57:40.600 --> 57:42.600
I think if I see sandalwood.

57:42.600 --> 57:43.600
F-I-R.

57:43.600 --> 57:44.600
E, fire.

57:45.600 --> 57:47.600
Plus E or in parentheses.

57:47.600 --> 57:49.600
Minus eight.

57:49.600 --> 57:52.600
And if you divide that by the smell, then you get?

57:52.600 --> 57:53.600
Eight through six.

57:53.600 --> 57:54.600
Oh, shit.

57:54.600 --> 57:55.600
Yeah, roll.

57:55.600 --> 57:56.600
Roll back.

57:56.600 --> 57:57.600
Roll back.

57:57.600 --> 58:00.600
And it's all my fault.

58:15.600 --> 58:18.600
He shit his pants.

58:18.600 --> 58:19.600
I shit my pants.

58:19.600 --> 58:20.600
Zach shit his pants for real.

58:20.600 --> 58:21.600
Method acting.

58:21.600 --> 58:23.600
We're gonna have to spray down the pod room.

58:23.600 --> 58:24.600
It's all over the walls.

58:24.600 --> 58:26.600
It's gonna be tough to clean that out.

58:26.600 --> 58:28.600
You can tell your wife that you shit yourself on your podcast.

58:28.600 --> 58:29.600
For money.

58:29.600 --> 58:31.600
If you actually shit yourself, Zach looks crazy.

58:31.600 --> 58:33.600
If you actually shit yourself, I'm sorry.

58:33.600 --> 58:34.600
I've never shit myself before.

58:34.600 --> 58:35.600
Did you?

58:35.600 --> 58:36.600
I hope including now.

58:36.600 --> 58:39.600
Is your blood back in your head or out of it?

58:39.600 --> 58:40.600
Whatever happened?

58:40.600 --> 58:42.600
Taylor Zach shit himself.
