0	7480	Come tidings to all of our listeners here on KITI City Radio, where the only thing softer than the vibe is the K in our name.
7480	12720	I'm your host, Steve Innsmouth, filling in for Barry Nasti for the foreseeable future.
12800	19140	Let us slide right into what is, personally, to me, my favorite segment, in my opinion, within the show.
19260	20580	It's time for,
20580	27400	Hey There Steve, where listeners here in the city can send thoughts and opinions to be read by me, your host, now and forever,
28080	32740	Steve Innsmouth, your host. This listener wants to remain anonymous,
32740	37920	but I think we all know there is no hiding when you open your stupid fucking mouth and try to speak truth to power.
38000	39040	They write,
39040	42760	Hey there, Steve. Big fan. Love the new direction for the show.
43200	49960	Anywho, wowee, are things getting out of control here in the city. When the hospital caught fire and killed all those innocent children,
49960	53280	we all said, wowee, it can't get worse than this.
53640	60680	But Goobers Gracious did it. With the death of Ferguson Beans following Bruce Robin to sell off Raw Beans Industries to an overseas
60920	66080	conglomerate, the unemployment rate has skyrocketed. We need someone to step up and do something about it.
66520	71640	Wow, yes, and that's not to mention the catastrophic news of the evacuation of our neighboring town,
71800	74920	Contention, due to a chemical spill from what was once Perdition,
74920	80160	but is now unincorporated land west of the soon-to-also-be unincorporated town of Contention.
80200	87120	Well, if there's one thing we here at KITI City Radio know, the only thing most people do in the face of abject horror and
87120	93280	conscious destruction is to chill the fuck out and listen to House Fire by Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin.
110160	112160	Oh
114560	116560	I distinctly remember where we left off.
117600	119320	Are we all sounding good?
119320	127120	Checka one two penis in the poo. Checka da chiney the Chinese chicken. Okay, so this morning I woke up at eight and
127920	132020	Taylor is normally gone for work by
133200	137600	seven. What time does school start? I don't know. I think she has to be there like
138360	143920	720 or 730 or something like that and they're really not sure when it starts, but I woke up at eight and
144920	149920	My phone is over by my bathroom. So I immediately went and had my morning
150920	152920	constitutional and
153040	155180	During said poop. I
155900	159020	Heard footsteps in the living room that walked
159720	163160	very carefully into the guest bathroom and
163680	166800	Then closed the door and then it was silent
167720	170440	And my heart was beating
171360	175120	So fast like out of my chest and my contacts weren't in and I was pooping
175560	180040	So I like and you're also like super small and cannot defend yourself
183880	185880	Exactly so I
186320	189100	silently wiped and then like
189440	194980	got up and like tiptoed across my room in my underwear and put in my contacts and then
195300	198840	Got my phone and dialed 911 and like had my
199420	203820	thumb like ready to call it and I like creeped down the hallway and
204620	210260	The door is closed to the guest bathroom and I couldn't hear anything coming from inside
210380	216380	and so I tiptoed past to the kitchen and I grabbed my chef's knife and
217380	219860	Then in my boxer briefs
220860	228300	Holding my cell phone with 911 ready to go and a chef's knife in my other hand busted into our guest bathroom and
229020	231020	She she was home sick
233500	239140	Busted in on my sick tired early morning wife with with a knife
240420	244000	That's hilarious. How was that? We were both horrified
244000	246000	Damn
246720	248720	Dude
248840	255580	So anyway the winner that's hilarious though the winner of this bloody beating stumbles to his feet
255960	259240	Exhausted and panicked. Hold on. I want to hit that one more time
262160	265800	You gotta give it a little contact every little heads up
265800	275000	The winner of this bloody beating stumbles to his feet
275480	279560	Exhausted and panicked he begins to run back to his personal cage
279960	284420	Open and locked into place on the side of the hanging plexiglass room
284600	289940	But he slips on the blood from the young boy beaten and prostrate. He looks terrified
290660	295740	You realize why when the ceiling begins to lower it is slow
295780	301220	But ceaseless the weekend champion boy scrapes and crawls just quickly enough
301420	309300	To slide into his cube of metal bars as the ersatz ceiling closes in on the perforated floor
310140	313380	eliciting a guttural moan from the now deceased
314140	315460	crushed
315460	317460	juiced boy
317820	325620	The blood rains down onto the gaudy and deranged crowd below many holding their mouths open and tongues out
325940	329100	Like an innocent child trying to taste snowflake
329340	335940	The cages attached at either end of this hanging chamber one holding the tired winner and the other vacant
336580	344420	Unlock and detach moving along the ceiling mounted conveyor belt and through a dark exit in the far corner away from you
345100	347780	John Lee Pettymore Keith Vigna Clark Bishop
348100	354900	you sit smushed into cages alongside Doug Jacobs and FBI agent Trent Chad's body a
355100	362100	Man, so massive his muscles are bulging against the metal bars and a boy who looks so underfed and sickly
362240	366280	He could likely slip right out of the cage. I want to fight the boy
368500	370500	Man this is
371220	374100	This won't be good it sounds good to be rich
374580	381340	Dude, I would love to watch someone get smushed through tiny holes and then try to drink their blood. Yeah, who we
382580	384580	You're juiced
385900	388380	Juiced okay. Tell us what happens next
389960	392160	Like the world's most elaborate ninja
393700	395700	That's a juicer, right
396420	398420	What
398940	403320	Yeah, okay and then just like a blender like a smoothie blender, oh
404140	407100	Wow, Oh blender would be cool for another like
407740	414260	That for later blender would be a great name for a bisexual dating app. Yep. I was gonna say like grinder blender
414260	418640	It's extremely good. Yeah, it probably is. Yeah likely anyway
419700	426000	Bloodsport. Is there anything on my person? No, I've got my underwear and I've got a gun and you can feel
426560	432560	You can feel your tiny powerful gun in your underwear Keith throbbing in my pants. I
433640	438360	Watch all of this in horror. Oh, yeah, everyone roll sanity
440040	442040	Whoops oh
444440	448360	Shit I rolled it too and then knocked my microphone over as I
449200	455800	Can I use some celebration but I got it too. Hell yeah the last time I'll probably pass sanity for a while
456640	458320	I
458320	460960	Passed I got a 15 in class buddies. I
462200	465360	Did not pass. Okay, Keith you lose one sanity
465360	471760	How did I I think Clark and John are likely confident that they can win in a fistfight?
473520	475520	Well Keith just saw himself
476520	478520	Did get juiced?
479520	481720	In his own mind so
482240	489040	We're in cages like all along the walls of this cube basically, so I'm picturing it as the cube is
490200	498360	Like an elongated room in the middle hanging above and then separately on the walls like all along the ceiling are
498360	503120	Different conveyor belt lines and they can move the cages all around the room. Gotcha
503120	507120	Okay, and you guys are on one side of them up against the wall
507120	511320	Yeah, the six cages how soon does it look like we're gonna be up on the conveyor?
511320	514520	Well, there are only six cages and you're three people
514520	520200	So it's the boy the guy the huge guy us three and Doug
521640	527160	Yeah, Chad in agent Chad's body. Hey, hey Doug
528280	530280	Yeah
530320	532320	Calm down buddy. It's alright
533840	537080	Do you still feel like you need to do everything we say
538480	540240	Just do you want me to
540240	546160	What do you mean? Don't worry about it. I yell over it. I am not worried about it anymore. I yell over Doug
546160	552400	I'm like also, yeah, if if you fight one of us and you lose your nightmare is over and you'll wake back up
555120	557840	Yeah, does anybody have anything on them
557840	559640	I don't know who's listening right now
559640	565320	So I kind of like look at both of you and I kind of like make like the shooty gun
565680	569920	hand and then point to my underwear and I'm like
571160	577960	Trying to give a sign like do you know you've got visibly shaking? He said no, like I don't want that my man
577960	579760	Okay, I don't want to say it out loud
579760	584880	So I don't I like kind of like do some kind of motion to try to get you guys to know
585360	589700	But I'm not gonna be like, yeah, I have a gun in my pants Keith
589700	594640	Just whisper what you're trying to say in my ear and then do the same for I'm in a cage
594640	599120	Are we that close? Oh, I thought we were all in one. You're extremely close, but you're in separate cages
599360	605280	Yeah, so that's why I was doing that. So I was picturing. Yeah, I do not I do not say
605880	607400	That I have it out loud
607400	611240	Can I swing my cage back and forth the cages connected on?
611560	615480	Some kind of sturdy rod at least like two points gotcha
615480	619900	So you could probably shake a little back and forth, but it's not gonna move very much
620440	626840	Doing so however elicits no response from the crowd below as they are far too concerned. Just
627360	629360	Raging like they're drinking
630080	637080	Okay, so if we if I look around hold on let's I want to pee on them
638200	640200	Yeah, okay
640360	647940	How powerful is John Lee Pettymore stream solid you just make him do a p-roll. Okay. Yeah, that's right. Can you roll?
648600	650600	Constitution
651560	653560	At a negative 20
654760	656760	Sure
661560	669120	99 a crit fail involving my penis. Yep. That's absolutely correct. I
671080	672920	John Lee Pettymore
672920	674920	struggles to remove
675760	677000	his
677000	681560	penis from his underwear to urinate on the crowd below
682200	685360	He slips within the cage and falls
686120	689960	dick first onto the bottom of the cage and
690740	694920	you fall right on the bottom of your shaft and
695840	698680	as you begin to urinate it is
699320	707000	Red as it comes out and a couple people who are closest to where you're at who are part of the crowd
707480	709040	notice and
709040	710360	begin to
710360	712240	bathe in your
712240	714680	Bloody your urine. Yeah, I thought they might
719360	721360	You lose one hit point
722280	726160	Okay, I want to scan the faces of the crowd right now know anybody yes
726200	731880	You would notice I think especially Clark Bishop wouldn't would know the faces of these people
732120	738840	The mayor the DA and the chief of police are all in attendance of the city of the city
738840	743640	Oh, okay. I want to look around the crowd and see if I can see if there's like
744480	746880	Someone in a position that looks like they are
747600	754000	Controlling this event like a MC or like the host of the game that's going on
754000	760840	so there is a bar on one far side of the room with one bartender and
761640	765240	Sitting at the bar is a lone figure who is
765920	769400	Dressed in all black. He is of
770060	774480	Average build he's about six feet tall. He has light brown hair and a mustache
775200	782000	He is wearing tight black pants and he has a dead stare with scars on his forehead and neck
782600	785120	Do they look like wounds or like ritual?
786440	790440	ritualistic scars they look medical from
792120	794800	You can see very well from what you're at
795920	797920	Luke the room is
798040	800040	Laid out pretty bare
800360	805440	Really? There's just this bar on one side. They're seating all around not in the splash zone
806560	813040	that some people are in but the majority of the crowd is in this middle section with couches and
813600	817960	recliners and pallets of pillows and and papa songs in which I had
822600	825020	Yes, absolutely papa songs from Pier one
825740	827020	I
827020	833460	Thought you'd made a fancy word for beanbag chair. Probably not from Pier one at a party. That's fancy. No, it's gone now here
835220	838960	They blew their budget on the blood dome, yeah
840620	845500	It must have been pretty expensive so so when I look down at the bar and I see that guy do I
845740	850160	Does he stand out as somebody whom he's the only guy at the bar, right? Yeah, okay
850160	855000	He seems like he's just watching over everyone and not partaking of anything
855600	860500	Necessarily and most people aren't in the blood pit. Most people are Oh are okay
860500	864860	Most people are there's just a few sitting about and even they might be, you know a bit splattered
865120	870920	But they have since walked away to regain their composure. Okay, but everybody looks like they're taking part
870920	875960	There's no people like sitting out except for bar a bar guy. Okay bartender
875960	882960	Can I do a quick estimate in my head about how blood drenched all the people are and how many fights they've seen
883080	891600	These people were pretty clean. Okay up until this this recent and about how many people are we talking 25 30? Okay
892480	900200	Slightly intimate blood Bowl exactly. So how far away from each other? Are we in our cages two feet? Okay. Hey
901720	903720	John Clark
903880	905880	Like try to get their attention
905960	910760	Yeah, are we gonna wait until we fight or or like do you have a plan to get out?
910760	912760	I have no idea what to do right now
914240	915240	Oh
915240	922600	I thought you were talking about your dick falling off which mine just kind of did know that looked very painful, but
923680	926580	What the fuck are we what are we gonna do right now?
927600	929800	Clark is purposefully remaining silent
929800	933920	but Keith just kind of sent him into a panic realizing that there is no plan and
934080	937880	He wants to start like shaking at the tops of the cage the sides of the cage
937880	943960	see if you can get anything to give way as you begin doing so you feel the conveyor belt begin to move and
944660	949680	Clark Bishop's cage begins moving no, no, no, no, no boys boys. No
950400	955160	I try to reach my hand out through the bars to like grab his hand
955160	959240	I reach out to grab and as your hands embrace
960040	962440	they just as quickly release as
963440	965080	Clark begins
965080	972480	moving inside of his cage toward the plexiglass room hanging above and one other cage also
972760	979320	begins moving to the other side of the plexiglass cage and in it resides a
980400	981720	sickly
981720	983360	sad
983360	984880	tired looking
984880	991040	boy, the cages make their way to either side of the plexiglass room and
991520	994400	Lock into place before the doors
995440	997440	Open and a buzzer
997760	1000200	Sounds the crowd goes wild
1002160	1004160	John shouts kick his ass Clark
1005640	1012680	What's the kid how's the kid look what's he doing the kid is sitting in his cage and as his door opens he slowly
1013400	1019760	crawls out and stands as tall as he can and then begins hitting his chest as
1020480	1025420	Hard as he can and he begins screaming at his feet just
1026920	1029120	And this is a 12 year old boy
1035800	1039680	Clark is yelling down through the holes in the ground
1040720	1044320	So somebody stop this. I'm not gonna kill a kid
1045160	1050640	Are you still in your cage, I'm gonna say no, I've already said I was screaming down through those holes. Oh, right
1052000	1055480	Okay, nothing happens. Well, he's down there
1055680	1060600	Can I like look at my cage and see like obviously one end opens up into the plexiglass?
1061120	1063120	what I'm trying to do is
1063760	1071500	Find which edge that is and see if there's any way to like get it open before it hits the plexiglass
1071980	1079620	Got you I have 50 lock picking you do I do but you don't under craft lock picking tools with you
1079620	1085200	I know that you have the skill of locking but you don't have the tools with you and there's no lock on your cage
1085620	1089920	So, but he knows stuff things. So I but he knows how things open and close, right?
1090020	1094100	So I am able to identify which side of the cage opens up
1094300	1100200	Yeah, and I'll let you roll that Oh when you want to attempt to try to open that door, okay
1100200	1101900	It's not gonna be right now, but for sure
1101900	1109140	Clark is pounding on the plexiglass trying to see if there's any person giving more attention than anybody else roll alertness
1113000	1115000	Fail okay
1118160	1125080	Clark you feel a tiny foot run straight into the side of your head as this boy is
1125280	1133000	Flung himself through the air at you and you did not see him coming you take one point of damage as he rolls across you and
1133640	1135240	You hit the ground
1135240	1141720	The fight has begun. What would you like to do that kick in the head sent me into a rage
1143440	1150400	And I yell and I turn and I I want to pummel the kid I roll on armed combat I
1155080	1157080	Hit my number exactly exactly
1157760	1163800	That's the best thing you can roll without hurting. I've got a negative now, don't I you have a negative 20, dude
1163800	1165440	We all do. Yep
1165440	1171920	Yeah, oh, we're all gonna suck it come bad if we I didn't set it up. Did you guys on our combat?
1171920	1175800	I know I've got 40 a horse. I have a 70 in it. Oh shit
1176360	1178360	You're the only one I had a hope
1178640	1182280	Okay, both rolling. Yeah, I failed. So did the boy in his
1183000	1186320	In his attempt tiny orphan legs shattered
1187440	1193920	and the two of you begin grappling it is his turn and he is going to try to
1195160	1197160	Pin you to the ground
1200600	1202800	Pass I rolled a crit fail
1202800	1209880	So I would like you to describe as this kid tries to grapple you what you do with his body
1209880	1214760	I picture that I was he was starting to get me down on the ground and I use that momentum
1215760	1221880	Because he's a small little boy and I'm a big man and I use that momentum to flip around and I'm now on top of him
1221880	1225880	So I've reversed that attempted grapple. Absolutely a roll alertness for me
1228400	1232920	Pass you see his eyes begin to widen as he looks up and
1233560	1236960	you hear the creaking of the ceiling begin to
1237960	1243760	Make its way toward you. You still have the upper hand. What do you do? I clobber him in his face
1243920	1247680	All right, go ahead and roll that. I'm gonna roll to try to defend myself
1251560	1257560	Pass and he fails once again, so you can roll a d4 for damage. Oh
1259560	1261560	You getting hit with a four my boy
1261560	1263560	So
1263560	1270840	You just like grab the front of his hair and begin smashing his head into the plexiglass in my mind
1270840	1275600	I'm doing it just enough to get him unconscious. I don't want to kill him. All right, okay as you're doing this
1275600	1281500	He's gonna try to grab your hands your arms your forearms to push you away from him
1281880	1285180	So roll one more time for me an arm. Yes, sir
1286180	1293660	Pass I rolled another crit fail. Are you crit failing all of them? Really? I rolled I've rolled 88 twice. Holy shit
1293660	1295660	Those are good die
1297940	1304820	How do you make this kid unconscious as the ceiling begins to close in on you guys I'm doing the head slamming thing
1305420	1309560	Into the ground and then when I feel like I've got him like within an inch of his life
1309560	1312140	I'm doing a my hardest right hook to the face
1312980	1318140	By trying to knock him out purposefully as your fist connects with the young
1319460	1326020	It's the kid from mid-90s. It's the kid from it's the baby child from mid-90s and
1327220	1329580	The kid with the list from stranger things
1335940	1337940	Into the ground
1339300	1341300	He's like, I'm sorry sir, I didn't
1342140	1344140	so
1346340	1353260	With one last right hook your fist connects and moves through his baby fragile chin and
1354140	1357960	His neck kind of goes limp as he hits the ground
1357960	1363940	It is up to you what you do next as it's not this boy's turn because this boy
1365120	1366340	Dustin
1366340	1371620	Is unconscious I stand over him breathing heavy and I'm yelling to the crowd
1372140	1379100	He kicked me first. He kicked me first. God damn it. They are laughing their asses off. They're
1379740	1381940	uproariously giggling all of them
1383580	1385500	The ceiling is
1385500	1389220	Closing in on you is my cage door open your cage door is open
1389300	1395140	I'm gonna try and drag the kid into the cage with me. Awesome. First. I need you to roll Constitution
1396180	1400300	Is that does that get a negative with the willpower stuff? Yes, okay
1403100	1405100	I rolled an eight
1405260	1406500	helipass
1406500	1412160	Congratulations, so you feel a tinge of pain in your chest
1412820	1417080	Where you felt that tightness this morning when you woke up in a cab?
1417500	1424860	but you push through the pain and grab this boy and begin to drag him across and toward your cage and
1425180	1430240	When you get there, do you throw him into the cage first or do you get in?
1430320	1436360	I'm dragging him in my mind and I'm backing my end of the cage first myself and trying to pull him in exactly with me
1436360	1441900	As soon as you get in everything works out and you are free to go. Everything's great
1443200	1448620	confetti pours from the ceiling and a big banner falls down that says I
1449400	1454160	Happy we love you. Happy birthday promotion Clark and it's it's
1455840	1457840	It's that Michael
1458480	1462340	Michael Douglas Michael W Smith the game. Who's that?
1462340	1467200	Michael Michael that oh, no, the game is Neil Strauss
1467280	1474400	No, the main actor in the movie the game. I don't know the game. Anyway, I hate that. I know who wrote the game
1474840	1478820	Is that the game the shitty red pill thing?
1479000	1479520	Yeah
1479520	1480800	definitely Clark
1480800	1487620	When you drag this boy into the cage with you as soon as his body enters the cage alongside yours the entire
1487840	1489840	cage becomes
1490120	1492120	electromagnetic and you feel an
1492440	1498040	Intense burning shock going through all of the skin that's touching the bars of your cage
1498640	1500740	Stand on the kid. I need you
1501480	1503360	actually
1503360	1507560	It does for damage. Holy shit to you as you smell
1508080	1515960	What is that delicious smell Thomas? Is it the skin of Clark Bishop? It is your skin smells pretty good Clark
1517840	1519600	Oh
1519600	1521280	Where's the kid's body right now?
1521280	1527280	It's like kind of on you like a half in and half out of the cage as you continue to get
1527720	1530720	Burned up by the bars. I don't want to let his body go
1530720	1535720	But I want to push it toward the put into the plexiglass room so that it's not in the cage at all
1535720	1539000	Oh as you do that the burning sensation stops
1542200	1544640	All right, I'm just staying like that for a little while
1544760	1547800	Okay, the ceiling comes down and
1549040	1552640	the ceiling touches the boy's head and then it's
1553400	1557080	lower and lower and Clark shoves the boys
1557800	1559800	lifeless limp body
1560560	1565920	onto the floor of the plexiglass room as the ceiling comes down and
1566760	1567920	smashes
1567920	1572360	completely leveling this boy's skin and bones
1573200	1576600	Into this weird pulp this dark
1577720	1579960	oily pulp that begins
1580840	1588040	Raining down on the crowd below who are losing their fucking minds. They are
1588680	1590680	loving it
1591200	1595880	Your cage door closes and you begin to move your conveyor belt moves
1596200	1601580	Along the line and it's heading toward the dark exit that the other boy had gone through
1601740	1606340	But at the very last second it stops and you have full sight of the room
1607060	1612380	It's for a plot reason and not so that you can just stay in the room
1614460	1618820	From my vantage point am I how far away like what's my new position in the room?
1619140	1624380	You are 20 yards away from the plexiglass which leads you to be
1625620	1627620	50 yards away from
1627700	1628780	your
1628780	1636120	Fellow police officers ass fucking room Clark is just gonna look wild-eyed at my officer friends and maybe shaking his head
1636120	1638120	No, so I need to do sanity
1638720	1641940	Clark can you roll sanity for me? Obviously? What's
1642860	1650180	Holy shit, I does sanity get a negative if sanity got a negative. I would have a negative. Yeah, let's say no sanity's just
1651700	1653660	Yeah, let's let's say no, okay
1653660	1654780	Let's I know cuz in fact
1654780	1662140	I I would even venture to say that being because like exhausted and not quite in touch with reality would make it
1663620	1669220	Yeah, I'm gonna give you a plus 20 while you take no, no, I'm not kidding while you take a negative 20 on everything else
1669220	1674300	Let's do a plus 20 on sanity. Actually, that's kind of fucking dope. Okay, that's a that's a fine trade for me
1674300	1680100	Yeah, yeah, I like that. I will gladly take a plus 20 to sanity. So you pass I pass either way
1680180	1684020	Okay, so John and Keith you are in cages
1684820	1686340	alongside a
1686340	1690400	Doug in the FBI body as well as a extremely large
1691020	1693020	bulgus man and
1693060	1697020	You notice both of us. No, I said bulgus. Okay
1697880	1701680	Which means like a bulger bulgarious exactly
1703460	1704540	And
1704540	1705540	So
1705540	1711820	You would notice this guy actually has a massive tattoo on his back. That says mayhem, which is pretty cool
1711820	1716540	I show him my matching tattoo and a wink just Clark see that from across the room
1716540	1721500	Yeah, you might be able to see that. Am I two feet away from this guy as well? Yeah. Hey, dude, what's your name?
1723260	1729380	Ozzie yes Ozzie. What are you what? How did you wind up in this predicament? Well
1730900	1732900	You see I am cage fighter
1733820	1739220	Can I do this voice? Yeah, we're not with them anymore. So
1740760	1742920	He I am cage fighter and
1743580	1745580	What's your stage name?
1745820	1752860	well, I am Oz mayhem as you may see from my tattoo on my back and my last name is wolf and
1753980	1758740	my brother Elby, he he owed the glass family lots of money and
1759460	1764260	I went to fight in the scrap pit for him to try to earn this money and
1765140	1769060	You know, I was quite good. I was quite good at it
1769060	1775900	I still am and I was winning all of this money and my lifestyle became more and more
1776340	1781740	Extravagant until I couldn't afford the lifestyle. I wanted to live any longer and
1782500	1785780	So as it goes I currently own
1786380	1788700	Marvin glass a lot of money and
1789020	1795280	So he has me fighting in here as a way to get through this scrap pit is Marvin glass in this room
1795300	1800900	No, I do not think so. He'd like looks around and he's like no I do not see him
1800980	1807540	Do you know who that guy is and I point down to the guy at the bar? Oh, yes, that's Marvin security
1807580	1812380	His name is Kevin. What if I could get Marvin glass a large sum of money?
1812860	1819180	Would he let us out of these cages out of these cages no if he has you in here it is clearly for sport
1819340	1825300	Okay, how many times have you won this? Have you been in this predicament? Yes, but this is easy
1825300	1830260	They mostly throw children at you and that is fine. It is nothing to kill a child
1830900	1835820	It is much easier than beating down say a planet juggernaut. I
1836380	1839260	look down at my hands and I
1839900	1846240	Think about the possibility of me having to fight this guy and I start silently sobbing to myself
1846940	1848100	and
1848100	1855460	Then I look up at the part of the cage that I had found opens and I try my damnedest to open it up
1855460	1861660	All right, as you begin to fiddle with it your cage begins moving toward the plexiglass
1862300	1868720	Chamber, I mean one other I want to yeah, who's the other cage as you look behind you you see?
1869380	1871420	John Lee Pettymore's cage is
1872220	1878380	Also moving and the two of you begin to travel. Okay. Can I try the fucking bastard?
1880060	1884340	And I need you to roll your lot picking at 50 at a negative 20
1889580	1891580	99
1894580	1897420	Guys these dice have been rolling it real low for me tonight
1899260	1901260	You
1901340	1904580	Don't want our us to get our 99 filth on your desk
1905820	1908500	Keith as you fiddle with your cage
1909100	1914040	You almost get it unlocked and as the cage door
1914340	1921240	Begins to unhinge and move out of place you feel the most intense burning sensation
1921460	1926520	All over your skin that is touching these metal bars and you take
1927520	1931760	For damage putting your hit points at what for
1934280	1940520	And your cage attaches and locks into place across from John Lee Pettymore's cage
1940600	1942720	Which also locks into place in?
1943600	1947680	between you is a bloody pulpy pool and
1948640	1950560	your cage doors
1950560	1952560	open I
1952760	1954760	Look over John
1956840	1959560	And get my gun out and I just start shooting
1960080	1965400	Down at the bottom of the plexiglass to see if I can break a hole into it
1965400	1967080	I start jumping up and down
1967080	1971880	I run out of my cage and jump up and down on the spots where he's shot and try to smash through
1975200	1980960	Yes, yeah fuck yeah, yeah hell yeah that absolutely works they don't think you have a gun
1981800	1988900	Especially an extremely powerful gun that's super small for some reason exactly. I brought probably the best one with me
1989760	1991280	so
1991280	1993280	Do I need to roll anything for that?
1993280	1993600	No
1993600	1997800	You're just shooting a gun into the ground as long as you don't hit yourself actually go ahead and roll
1998160	2004620	Roll me dice and if the if the pair it's at 99 again, you know, that won't we do
2004620	2007760	Well immediately ricochets under your brain
2008680	2012800	53 yeah, yeah sure. Okay. So what do you what do you want to happen here?
2012800	2018040	I guess we never really talked about this gun. How many rounds do I hold in this gun?
2018040	2024560	It has as many rounds as until I find plot interesting enough and you current failing enough for you
2024920	2026320	okay, so I
2026320	2028320	Petty more and I lock eyes. I
2028840	2036240	Pull out the gun and I just start in a circle shooting and I see as each bullet hits
2036240	2040720	The plexiglass cracks a little more and petty more sees the cracks
2040720	2046500	I start jumping up and down and I'm I'm expecting if we go like I'm looking at the motherfucker
2046500	2050340	I'm trying to land on like so as I fall through I do a
2050960	2058560	Six shots in a circle. He's jumping and I start jumping after that and I am also aiming at a big
2059000	2064000	Fat ugly motherfucker in a papasan right below me as I'm jumping
2064000	2065480	I
2065480	2070640	Clark in his cage is losing his mind cheering. This is the best thing he's ever seen
2070640	2074080	I want you to know the crowd is also
2074600	2078400	Freaking out and super into this like they are so excited right now
2078880	2083440	Except for like half of them who kind of understand what's happening
2083440	2087940	Were any of them hit by stray rounds going through the if you're really paying that close of attention
2088000	2093720	Yeah, absolutely a couple went straight through some noggins and how does the crowd react to that?
2093840	2100040	They begin lapping up the blood. Yeah. Yeah as the two of you jump up and down
2100040	2102040	I think three times
2102600	2109160	on that third jump the plexiglass breaks and the two of you on a
2109680	2111680	circular plexiglass
2112080	2113440	punctuated
2113440	2115440	perforated platform land
2115920	2121520	Square on top of the fattest ugliest motherfucker you've ever seen sit in a papasan chair
2122160	2128760	He completely out. Oh, I see you've heard of body flattened before
2134160	2136160	Watch bodies flat
2136520	2138520	our slash
2138740	2140740	plexiglass
2140740	2143040	That's a fat guy's in a papasan guinea
2144540	2146580	Oh, so you've been to top post yeah
2146580	2147140	Yeah
2147140	2153220	So top all time as this happens the crowd begins to go wild and you are now
2153820	2156480	Amidst this crowd who does not know
2157300	2163020	whether or not to continue to soak up the blood of those who have fallen or
2163400	2170420	To run away in terror. The first thing I do upon landing is aim my gun at Kevin
2170740	2175780	And fire a single shot hoping to hit his chest roll firearms. I
2176660	2184500	Do not pass you shoot right over his shoulder and nailed the bartender who flies back into the mirror on the back of the bar
2184500	2192380	And is crunched up against the bar. Can I take one one more shot? No, John. What do you do? Ah,
2192980	2198260	Okay, give me a second. No, so okay. Well, then I have an answer. I
2199140	2202860	Just wanted to think of a better one, but John just runs into the crowd
2205580	2211900	John without even taking a look around just like runs at this first motherfucker in front of them and tackles him
2211900	2217180	It's a dude with like an extremely curly mustache and he has a massive
2217580	2224220	Ascot flowing out from underneath one of his vests and you just lay him the fuck out
2224220	2228300	Yeah, I just want to go GTA on as many people in this room as I can until
2228900	2232300	Consequences catch up with me Clark. What are you doing? I want to be spitting them
2236980	2238980	Be careful
2241560	2244180	Can you roll a spitting check now, oh
2244780	2251600	Wait, wait, I have an I have a line to add to what I said as he's beating people. He's just like you broke my dick
2251600	2259360	Good, let's take it from the top. Yes. It is a unseasonably warm. I
2260880	2264880	Want to be Keith this time. Oh, I'll be the goo
2266480	2274640	Okay, as John Lee Pettymore is laying into just any person around him he's just screaming you bastards broke
2274640	2276640	my dick
2277640	2280040	Clark who you spitting on everyone
2280720	2284600	Everyone that's below me. I'm really hawking as hard as I can. I'm doing it out of spite
2284600	2288680	Maybe maybe I'll get somebody to look up and I'm really trying to spit on them
2298560	2300560	Wing Jeff
2300560	2302560	Do you
2303480	2306520	There's some pretty hard spits too because you're pretty dehydrated
2307880	2312240	Can I go again or is it everyone else's turn that what happens right now?
2312240	2316720	It's everyone else's turn and the crowd begins to dissipate
2317080	2322200	There are about five people who are so enthralled with the entire
2323080	2327520	Situation that they are just lapping up the blood on the floor
2328160	2332980	Snorting it licking at it everything they can do to get others blood in their body
2333480	2341440	Standing at the bar is Kevin who has not moved Keith. What do you do? I run up to the bar and
2342240	2348920	Try to tackle Kevin. Okay roll unarmed combat at a negative 20. Oh, I think it was gonna be strength, but okay
2349840	2354560	I've been having some damn bad rolls his luck a thing still
2355120	2357120	Yeah, I want to spend some
2359280	2363000	Yeah, dope, okay, so I rolled a 93 woof
2363360	2366760	So dick, what do I need to do to use some luck here?
2366760	2372600	What is your unarmed combat at a negative 20 20 so you would have to spend 73 luck to get a success?
2372600	2376760	I don't have that. So just is there anything else I can do? No, okay
2376760	2383800	Well, I mean if you're that desperate, what did you point out determine outcome you use all your points that would take desperation
2383800	2385800	Yes, okay. I use all of my point
2387760	2389760	I was just pointing it out. Okay, I don't
2391000	2393680	Don't do it. I okay. I'll be the devil now
2393680	2399160	I run I run up to I run up to the bar and I see Kevin and I just run at him
2399160	2404620	And I jump off my feet into the air and trying to just like grab on to him
2404620	2406620	so he rolled a success and
2407060	2414620	He is gonna use all of that momentum against you as he he reaches forward and also ducks out of the way and
2415060	2419240	slams your head directly into the bar and you take
2420980	2422980	Six damage, okay
2423580	2430100	Four. Yeah, you're dead. So I am gonna use 30 luck points to avoid death. Hell yeah. Hell yeah
2430100	2435280	First big luck spin to the game. So that puts me at 35 and avoid death
2435400	2441280	But tell me how that works. So basically what happens is you move toward Kevin and
2441840	2448600	Kevin slams your head directly into the bar and you go blank completely unconscious and
2449400	2452040	You are bleeding out onto the ground
2452040	2459040	He looks down at you and then with completely cold dead eyes just walks away. You're dead
2459080	2461320	He's just gonna move on. Okay, I
2461320	2463000	I
2463000	2465440	Mean you're not dead cuz you spent the light but
2466760	2472400	Essentially, I'm out for the time being you are dead. So what's your look at now? 35
2473040	2478080	Clark, what do you do? How's the spittin going? Oh, man, you'd like you've hit one out of every ten spits
2478080	2483760	Which is good. It's really good. It's a far distance to spit. You know, you gotta at least get ten yards
2483760	2487640	You also did just see me get destroyed. So maybe
2488480	2490480	Maybe you're mad and you do something
2491320	2497680	I do want to try and start shaking my cage and see if I can break the motherfucker off the track
2497680	2500520	I shake so hard. I shake so hard. I
2501400	2503400	Vibrate so hard within the cage
2505840	2510960	No, I want to take both hands on each side of the cage and just throwing my weight back and forth
2510960	2512960	Do you wait back and forth?
2513800	2516800	roll constitution first with a negative 20 I
2518440	2520120	Pass a
2520120	2522520	13 on a 45 nice
2522680	2530200	So now roll strength because your chest is feeling that tight tight pain that it felt earlier
2530200	2533360	But you're able to continue and fight through it. I
2535800	2541000	Rolled a 13 again with different dice. I swear to God watching it happen. Everybody can see it's insane
2541360	2546000	You roll better than anyone I've ever met in my entire life. They're all lying
2546000	2547680	I
2547680	2550360	Rolled a 73 on the same pair of dice
2551080	2558280	Yeah, I passed it's also at a 45 with the mate with the minus. Okay, you you begin rocking back and forth John
2558280	2560280	what do you do I
2560320	2563120	Stop dead in my tracks when I see what happened to Keith
2564240	2571460	And I want to run over to check on him and also get his gun you run over and grab the gun out of Keith's
2571860	2579060	Hand as you do so you look up and you see Kevin who's standing at the bar Kevin can wait
2585180	2587180	We
2587220	2589220	Zach wrote that entire
2596260	2598260	You look in Kevin's eyes and
2598660	2601780	You get this weird feeling
2602500	2604020	because
2604020	2608620	You you feel like you know him. It's almost like you recognize him
2609140	2612620	But you don't you've never seen this this guy before
2613740	2617500	And his cold dead stare straight at you
2618940	2622820	for just a second flickers and
2623700	2627100	His eyes change and they look at you
2627700	2629700	with this
2629700	2631220	remembering and
2631220	2633980	Then it is immediately back to these cold eyes
2634060	2639180	I want to try to take the moment that he was off guard to shoot him in the face. Go for it
2640180	2642180	At a negative 20. Yeah
2642460	2645340	52 on a 60 so you fire a couple rounds
2645860	2651500	completely shaken not able to even hold this gun steady at all you miss and
2651740	2652580	And
2652580	2658420	He stares at you and then he just runs out of the room as fast as he can
2659580	2665420	John I'm standing you're standing Asian in confusion penis nursing your penis at the bar
2665420	2670940	Can I see what my other cage mates are doing like agent Doug Chad and his mayhem still in his?
2670940	2676260	Yeah, they're both in theirs. They're freaking out there. I mean, they're trying to pay attention. They're looking all around the room
2676260	2680260	Can I yell to Doug Chad? Yeah, sure break out of your cage, man. I
2681140	2685400	Thought about just asking him to do that earlier like Doug get out
2688020	2690020	It could work
2690680	2694240	Let's see Doug flips the obvious like lever
2702420	2707380	All right, now what it pulls another lever and it just lowers gently to the floor
2708340	2710940	Keith you're laying lifeless on the ground
2712140	2715640	Clark is rocking back and forth in this cage
2716220	2721900	hanging next to an empty dark void leading to another room and
2723020	2725020	John is standing at the bar
2725900	2728260	all the people in this room are
2728900	2730780	freaking out and
2730940	2737860	Running here and there and the last few of them trail out of the room as you hear a
2739540	2747480	Snap and Clark's cage falls to the ground and breaks open upon impact Clark you take
2750180	2753060	Eight damage from the fall that puts me out
2753060	2759840	I I too will use 30 points of luck to avoid death. What were you at? Oh seven
2760780	2766100	So now I'm at 45. Look god damn god damn had I not just on a whim
2767540	2773180	Put that gun in my pants. I don't know how oh we would have figured we would have figured it out
2773180	2777300	But I just don't know what it would have been. I would like beating you to death with your forehead
2777300	2783140	I mean you you would you would have killed me because you would have been turned to a goo and then you would have spent
2783140	2785140	30 luck to come back
2785980	2787980	How would could we have done that?
2790780	2792780	What we could
2795980	2797980	Save this house
2800900	2803380	But it burns because it's wood
2813900	2817080	Name I smoked all day
2820780	2822780	You sleep in it all day
