1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,480
Come tidings to all of our listeners here on KITI City Radio, where the only thing softer than the vibe is the K in our name.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,720
I'm your host, Steve Innsmouth, filling in for Barry Nasti for the foreseeable future.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,140
Let us slide right into what is, personally, to me, my favorite segment, in my opinion, within the show.

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,580
It's time for,

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:27,400
Hey There Steve, where listeners here in the city can send thoughts and opinions to be read by me, your host, now and forever,

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,740
Steve Innsmouth, your host. This listener wants to remain anonymous,

7
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,920
but I think we all know there is no hiding when you open your stupid fucking mouth and try to speak truth to power.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,040
They write,

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,760
Hey there, Steve. Big fan. Love the new direction for the show.

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,960
Anywho, wowee, are things getting out of control here in the city. When the hospital caught fire and killed all those innocent children,

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,280
we all said, wowee, it can't get worse than this.

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,680
But Goobers Gracious did it. With the death of Ferguson Beans following Bruce Robin to sell off Raw Beans Industries to an overseas

13
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,080
conglomerate, the unemployment rate has skyrocketed. We need someone to step up and do something about it.

14
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,640
Wow, yes, and that's not to mention the catastrophic news of the evacuation of our neighboring town,

15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,920
Contention, due to a chemical spill from what was once Perdition,

16
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,160
but is now unincorporated land west of the soon-to-also-be unincorporated town of Contention.

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:27,120
Well, if there's one thing we here at KITI City Radio know, the only thing most people do in the face of abject horror and

18
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:33,280
conscious destruction is to chill the fuck out and listen to House Fire by Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin.

19
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,160
Oh

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,560
I distinctly remember where we left off.

21
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,320
Are we all sounding good?

22
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:07,120
Checka one two penis in the poo. Checka da chiney the Chinese chicken. Okay, so this morning I woke up at eight and

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,020
Taylor is normally gone for work by

24
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,600
seven. What time does school start? I don't know. I think she has to be there like

25
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,920
720 or 730 or something like that and they're really not sure when it starts, but I woke up at eight and

26
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,920
My phone is over by my bathroom. So I immediately went and had my morning

27
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,920
constitutional and

28
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,180
During said poop. I

29
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,020
Heard footsteps in the living room that walked

30
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,160
very carefully into the guest bathroom and

31
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,800
Then closed the door and then it was silent

32
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,440
And my heart was beating

33
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,120
So fast like out of my chest and my contacts weren't in and I was pooping

34
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,040
So I like and you're also like super small and cannot defend yourself

35
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,880
Exactly so I

36
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,100
silently wiped and then like

37
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,980
got up and like tiptoed across my room in my underwear and put in my contacts and then

38
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,840
Got my phone and dialed 911 and like had my

39
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,820
thumb like ready to call it and I like creeped down the hallway and

40
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:30,260
The door is closed to the guest bathroom and I couldn't hear anything coming from inside

41
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:36,380
and so I tiptoed past to the kitchen and I grabbed my chef's knife and

42
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,860
Then in my boxer briefs

43
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:48,300
Holding my cell phone with 911 ready to go and a chef's knife in my other hand busted into our guest bathroom and

44
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,020
She she was home sick

45
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,140
Busted in on my sick tired early morning wife with with a knife

46
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,000
That's hilarious. How was that? We were both horrified

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Damn

48
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,720
Dude

49
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:15,580
So anyway the winner that's hilarious though the winner of this bloody beating stumbles to his feet

50
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,240
Exhausted and panicked. Hold on. I want to hit that one more time

51
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,800
You gotta give it a little contact every little heads up

52
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:35,000
The winner of this bloody beating stumbles to his feet

53
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,560
Exhausted and panicked he begins to run back to his personal cage

54
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,420
Open and locked into place on the side of the hanging plexiglass room

55
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,940
But he slips on the blood from the young boy beaten and prostrate. He looks terrified

56
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,740
You realize why when the ceiling begins to lower it is slow

57
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:01,220
But ceaseless the weekend champion boy scrapes and crawls just quickly enough

58
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:09,300
To slide into his cube of metal bars as the ersatz ceiling closes in on the perforated floor

59
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,380
eliciting a guttural moan from the now deceased

60
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,460
crushed

61
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,460
juiced boy

62
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:25,620
The blood rains down onto the gaudy and deranged crowd below many holding their mouths open and tongues out

63
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,100
Like an innocent child trying to taste snowflake

64
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:35,940
The cages attached at either end of this hanging chamber one holding the tired winner and the other vacant

65
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:44,420
Unlock and detach moving along the ceiling mounted conveyor belt and through a dark exit in the far corner away from you

66
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,780
John Lee Pettymore Keith Vigna Clark Bishop

67
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:54,900
you sit smushed into cages alongside Doug Jacobs and FBI agent Trent Chad's body a

68
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:02,100
Man, so massive his muscles are bulging against the metal bars and a boy who looks so underfed and sickly

69
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,280
He could likely slip right out of the cage. I want to fight the boy

70
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Man this is

71
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,100
This won't be good it sounds good to be rich

72
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:21,340
Dude, I would love to watch someone get smushed through tiny holes and then try to drink their blood. Yeah, who we

73
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,580
You're juiced

74
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,380
Juiced okay. Tell us what happens next

75
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,160
Like the world's most elaborate ninja

76
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,700
That's a juicer, right

77
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,420
What

78
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,320
Yeah, okay and then just like a blender like a smoothie blender, oh

79
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,100
Wow, Oh blender would be cool for another like

80
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:54,260
That for later blender would be a great name for a bisexual dating app. Yep. I was gonna say like grinder blender

81
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,640
It's extremely good. Yeah, it probably is. Yeah likely anyway

82
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:06,000
Bloodsport. Is there anything on my person? No, I've got my underwear and I've got a gun and you can feel

83
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,560
You can feel your tiny powerful gun in your underwear Keith throbbing in my pants. I

84
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,360
Watch all of this in horror. Oh, yeah, everyone roll sanity

85
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Whoops oh

86
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,360
Shit I rolled it too and then knocked my microphone over as I

87
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:35,800
Can I use some celebration but I got it too. Hell yeah the last time I'll probably pass sanity for a while

88
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,320
I

89
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,960
Passed I got a 15 in class buddies. I

90
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,360
Did not pass. Okay, Keith you lose one sanity

91
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,760
How did I I think Clark and John are likely confident that they can win in a fistfight?

92
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,520
Well Keith just saw himself

93
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,520
Did get juiced?

94
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,720
In his own mind so

95
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:09,040
We're in cages like all along the walls of this cube basically, so I'm picturing it as the cube is

96
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:18,360
Like an elongated room in the middle hanging above and then separately on the walls like all along the ceiling are

97
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,120
Different conveyor belt lines and they can move the cages all around the room. Gotcha

98
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,120
Okay, and you guys are on one side of them up against the wall

99
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,320
Yeah, the six cages how soon does it look like we're gonna be up on the conveyor?

100
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,520
Well, there are only six cages and you're three people

101
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:40,200
So it's the boy the guy the huge guy us three and Doug

102
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,160
Yeah, Chad in agent Chad's body. Hey, hey Doug

103
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,280
Yeah

104
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
Calm down buddy. It's alright

105
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,080
Do you still feel like you need to do everything we say

106
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,240
Just do you want me to

107
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,160
What do you mean? Don't worry about it. I yell over it. I am not worried about it anymore. I yell over Doug

108
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,400
I'm like also, yeah, if if you fight one of us and you lose your nightmare is over and you'll wake back up

109
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,840
Yeah, does anybody have anything on them

110
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,640
I don't know who's listening right now

111
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:25,320
So I kind of like look at both of you and I kind of like make like the shooty gun

112
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,920
hand and then point to my underwear and I'm like

113
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:37,960
Trying to give a sign like do you know you've got visibly shaking? He said no, like I don't want that my man

114
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,760
Okay, I don't want to say it out loud

115
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,880
So I don't I like kind of like do some kind of motion to try to get you guys to know

116
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,700
But I'm not gonna be like, yeah, I have a gun in my pants Keith

117
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,640
Just whisper what you're trying to say in my ear and then do the same for I'm in a cage

118
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,120
Are we that close? Oh, I thought we were all in one. You're extremely close, but you're in separate cages

119
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,280
Yeah, so that's why I was doing that. So I was picturing. Yeah, I do not I do not say

120
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,400
That I have it out loud

121
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,240
Can I swing my cage back and forth the cages connected on?

122
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,480
Some kind of sturdy rod at least like two points gotcha

123
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,900
So you could probably shake a little back and forth, but it's not gonna move very much

124
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,840
Doing so however elicits no response from the crowd below as they are far too concerned. Just

125
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
Raging like they're drinking

126
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:37,080
Okay, so if we if I look around hold on let's I want to pee on them

127
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,200
Yeah, okay

128
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:47,940
How powerful is John Lee Pettymore stream solid you just make him do a p-roll. Okay. Yeah, that's right. Can you roll?

129
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Constitution

130
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,560
At a negative 20

131
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,760
Sure

132
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:09,120
99 a crit fail involving my penis. Yep. That's absolutely correct. I

133
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,920
John Lee Pettymore

134
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,920
struggles to remove

135
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,000
his

136
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,560
penis from his underwear to urinate on the crowd below

137
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,360
He slips within the cage and falls

138
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,960
dick first onto the bottom of the cage and

139
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,920
you fall right on the bottom of your shaft and

140
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,680
as you begin to urinate it is

141
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:47,000
Red as it comes out and a couple people who are closest to where you're at who are part of the crowd

142
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,040
notice and

143
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,360
begin to

144
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,240
bathe in your

145
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,680
Bloody your urine. Yeah, I thought they might

146
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,360
You lose one hit point

147
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,160
Okay, I want to scan the faces of the crowd right now know anybody yes

148
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,880
You would notice I think especially Clark Bishop wouldn't would know the faces of these people

149
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:18,840
The mayor the DA and the chief of police are all in attendance of the city of the city

150
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,640
Oh, okay. I want to look around the crowd and see if I can see if there's like

151
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,880
Someone in a position that looks like they are

152
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,000
Controlling this event like a MC or like the host of the game that's going on

153
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,840
so there is a bar on one far side of the room with one bartender and

154
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,240
Sitting at the bar is a lone figure who is

155
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,400
Dressed in all black. He is of

156
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,480
Average build he's about six feet tall. He has light brown hair and a mustache

157
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:02,000
He is wearing tight black pants and he has a dead stare with scars on his forehead and neck

158
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,120
Do they look like wounds or like ritual?

159
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,440
ritualistic scars they look medical from

160
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,800
You can see very well from what you're at

161
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,920
Luke the room is

162
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,040
Laid out pretty bare

163
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,440
Really? There's just this bar on one side. They're seating all around not in the splash zone

164
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:33,040
that some people are in but the majority of the crowd is in this middle section with couches and

165
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,960
recliners and pallets of pillows and and papa songs in which I had

166
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,020
Yes, absolutely papa songs from Pier one

167
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,020
I

168
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:53,460
Thought you'd made a fancy word for beanbag chair. Probably not from Pier one at a party. That's fancy. No, it's gone now here

169
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,960
They blew their budget on the blood dome, yeah

170
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,500
It must have been pretty expensive so so when I look down at the bar and I see that guy do I

171
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,160
Does he stand out as somebody whom he's the only guy at the bar, right? Yeah, okay

172
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,000
He seems like he's just watching over everyone and not partaking of anything

173
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,500
Necessarily and most people aren't in the blood pit. Most people are Oh are okay

174
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,860
Most people are there's just a few sitting about and even they might be, you know a bit splattered

175
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,920
But they have since walked away to regain their composure. Okay, but everybody looks like they're taking part

176
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,960
There's no people like sitting out except for bar a bar guy. Okay bartender

177
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:42,960
Can I do a quick estimate in my head about how blood drenched all the people are and how many fights they've seen

178
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:51,600
These people were pretty clean. Okay up until this this recent and about how many people are we talking 25 30? Okay

179
00:14:52,480 --> 00:15:00,200
Slightly intimate blood Bowl exactly. So how far away from each other? Are we in our cages two feet? Okay. Hey

180
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,720
John Clark

181
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,880
Like try to get their attention

182
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,760
Yeah, are we gonna wait until we fight or or like do you have a plan to get out?

183
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,760
I have no idea what to do right now

184
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,240
Oh

185
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:22,600
I thought you were talking about your dick falling off which mine just kind of did know that looked very painful, but

186
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,580
What the fuck are we what are we gonna do right now?

187
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,800
Clark is purposefully remaining silent

188
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,920
but Keith just kind of sent him into a panic realizing that there is no plan and

189
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,880
He wants to start like shaking at the tops of the cage the sides of the cage

190
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:43,960
see if you can get anything to give way as you begin doing so you feel the conveyor belt begin to move and

191
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,680
Clark Bishop's cage begins moving no, no, no, no, no boys boys. No

192
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,160
I try to reach my hand out through the bars to like grab his hand

193
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,240
I reach out to grab and as your hands embrace

194
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,440
they just as quickly release as

195
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,080
Clark begins

196
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:12,480
moving inside of his cage toward the plexiglass room hanging above and one other cage also

197
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:19,320
begins moving to the other side of the plexiglass cage and in it resides a

198
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,720
sickly

199
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,360
sad

200
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,880
tired looking

201
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,040
boy, the cages make their way to either side of the plexiglass room and

202
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,400
Lock into place before the doors

203
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Open and a buzzer

204
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,200
Sounds the crowd goes wild

205
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
John shouts kick his ass Clark

206
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:52,680
What's the kid how's the kid look what's he doing the kid is sitting in his cage and as his door opens he slowly

207
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:59,760
crawls out and stands as tall as he can and then begins hitting his chest as

208
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,420
Hard as he can and he begins screaming at his feet just

209
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,120
And this is a 12 year old boy

210
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,680
Clark is yelling down through the holes in the ground

211
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,320
So somebody stop this. I'm not gonna kill a kid

212
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:30,640
Are you still in your cage, I'm gonna say no, I've already said I was screaming down through those holes. Oh, right

213
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,480
Okay, nothing happens. Well, he's down there

214
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,600
Can I like look at my cage and see like obviously one end opens up into the plexiglass?

215
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,120
what I'm trying to do is

216
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:51,500
Find which edge that is and see if there's any way to like get it open before it hits the plexiglass

217
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:59,620
Got you I have 50 lock picking you do I do but you don't under craft lock picking tools with you

218
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:05,200
I know that you have the skill of locking but you don't have the tools with you and there's no lock on your cage

219
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:09,920
So, but he knows stuff things. So I but he knows how things open and close, right?

220
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,100
So I am able to identify which side of the cage opens up

221
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:20,200
Yeah, and I'll let you roll that Oh when you want to attempt to try to open that door, okay

222
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,900
It's not gonna be right now, but for sure

223
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:29,140
Clark is pounding on the plexiglass trying to see if there's any person giving more attention than anybody else roll alertness

224
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Fail okay

225
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:45,080
Clark you feel a tiny foot run straight into the side of your head as this boy is

226
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:53,000
Flung himself through the air at you and you did not see him coming you take one point of damage as he rolls across you and

227
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,240
You hit the ground

228
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:01,720
The fight has begun. What would you like to do that kick in the head sent me into a rage

229
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:10,400
And I yell and I turn and I I want to pummel the kid I roll on armed combat I

230
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,080
Hit my number exactly exactly

231
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,800
That's the best thing you can roll without hurting. I've got a negative now, don't I you have a negative 20, dude

232
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,440
We all do. Yep

233
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,920
Yeah, oh, we're all gonna suck it come bad if we I didn't set it up. Did you guys on our combat?

234
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,800
I know I've got 40 a horse. I have a 70 in it. Oh shit

235
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,360
You're the only one I had a hope

236
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,280
Okay, both rolling. Yeah, I failed. So did the boy in his

237
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,320
In his attempt tiny orphan legs shattered

238
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,920
and the two of you begin grappling it is his turn and he is going to try to

239
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,160
Pin you to the ground

240
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,800
Pass I rolled a crit fail

241
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:09,880
So I would like you to describe as this kid tries to grapple you what you do with his body

242
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,760
I picture that I was he was starting to get me down on the ground and I use that momentum

243
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,880
Because he's a small little boy and I'm a big man and I use that momentum to flip around and I'm now on top of him

244
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,880
So I've reversed that attempted grapple. Absolutely a roll alertness for me

245
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,920
Pass you see his eyes begin to widen as he looks up and

246
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,960
you hear the creaking of the ceiling begin to

247
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,760
Make its way toward you. You still have the upper hand. What do you do? I clobber him in his face

248
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,680
All right, go ahead and roll that. I'm gonna roll to try to defend myself

249
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:57,560
Pass and he fails once again, so you can roll a d4 for damage. Oh

250
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,560
You getting hit with a four my boy

251
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,560
So

252
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:10,840
You just like grab the front of his hair and begin smashing his head into the plexiglass in my mind

253
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,600
I'm doing it just enough to get him unconscious. I don't want to kill him. All right, okay as you're doing this

254
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,500
He's gonna try to grab your hands your arms your forearms to push you away from him

255
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,180
So roll one more time for me an arm. Yes, sir

256
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:33,660
Pass I rolled another crit fail. Are you crit failing all of them? Really? I rolled I've rolled 88 twice. Holy shit

257
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,660
Those are good die

258
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:44,820
How do you make this kid unconscious as the ceiling begins to close in on you guys I'm doing the head slamming thing

259
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,560
Into the ground and then when I feel like I've got him like within an inch of his life

260
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,140
I'm doing a my hardest right hook to the face

261
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:58,140
By trying to knock him out purposefully as your fist connects with the young

262
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:06,020
It's the kid from mid-90s. It's the kid from it's the baby child from mid-90s and

263
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,580
The kid with the list from stranger things

264
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,940
Into the ground

265
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,300
He's like, I'm sorry sir, I didn't

266
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,140
so

267
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:33,260
With one last right hook your fist connects and moves through his baby fragile chin and

268
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,960
His neck kind of goes limp as he hits the ground

269
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:43,940
It is up to you what you do next as it's not this boy's turn because this boy

270
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,340
Dustin

271
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:51,620
Is unconscious I stand over him breathing heavy and I'm yelling to the crowd

272
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:59,100
He kicked me first. He kicked me first. God damn it. They are laughing their asses off. They're

273
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,940
uproariously giggling all of them

274
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,500
The ceiling is

275
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,220
Closing in on you is my cage door open your cage door is open

276
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:15,140
I'm gonna try and drag the kid into the cage with me. Awesome. First. I need you to roll Constitution

277
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:20,300
Is that does that get a negative with the willpower stuff? Yes, okay

278
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,100
I rolled an eight

279
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,500
helipass

280
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:32,160
Congratulations, so you feel a tinge of pain in your chest

281
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:37,080
Where you felt that tightness this morning when you woke up in a cab?

282
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:44,860
but you push through the pain and grab this boy and begin to drag him across and toward your cage and

283
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:50,240
When you get there, do you throw him into the cage first or do you get in?

284
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,360
I'm dragging him in my mind and I'm backing my end of the cage first myself and trying to pull him in exactly with me

285
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,900
As soon as you get in everything works out and you are free to go. Everything's great

286
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,620
confetti pours from the ceiling and a big banner falls down that says I

287
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,160
Happy we love you. Happy birthday promotion Clark and it's it's

288
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
It's that Michael

289
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,340
Michael Douglas Michael W Smith the game. Who's that?

290
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:27,200
Michael Michael that oh, no, the game is Neil Strauss

291
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:34,400
No, the main actor in the movie the game. I don't know the game. Anyway, I hate that. I know who wrote the game

292
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,820
Is that the game the shitty red pill thing?

293
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,520
Yeah

294
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,800
definitely Clark

295
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:47,620
When you drag this boy into the cage with you as soon as his body enters the cage alongside yours the entire

296
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,840
cage becomes

297
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,120
electromagnetic and you feel an

298
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:58,040
Intense burning shock going through all of the skin that's touching the bars of your cage

299
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,740
Stand on the kid. I need you

300
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,360
actually

301
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,560
It does for damage. Holy shit to you as you smell

302
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:15,960
What is that delicious smell Thomas? Is it the skin of Clark Bishop? It is your skin smells pretty good Clark

303
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,600
Oh

304
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,280
Where's the kid's body right now?

305
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:27,280
It's like kind of on you like a half in and half out of the cage as you continue to get

306
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,720
Burned up by the bars. I don't want to let his body go

307
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,720
But I want to push it toward the put into the plexiglass room so that it's not in the cage at all

308
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,000
Oh as you do that the burning sensation stops

309
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,640
All right, I'm just staying like that for a little while

310
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,800
Okay, the ceiling comes down and

311
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,640
the ceiling touches the boy's head and then it's

312
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,080
lower and lower and Clark shoves the boys

313
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,800
lifeless limp body

314
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,920
onto the floor of the plexiglass room as the ceiling comes down and

315
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,920
smashes

316
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,360
completely leveling this boy's skin and bones

317
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,600
Into this weird pulp this dark

318
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,960
oily pulp that begins

319
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:28,040
Raining down on the crowd below who are losing their fucking minds. They are

320
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,680
loving it

321
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,880
Your cage door closes and you begin to move your conveyor belt moves

322
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,580
Along the line and it's heading toward the dark exit that the other boy had gone through

323
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:46,340
But at the very last second it stops and you have full sight of the room

324
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:52,380
It's for a plot reason and not so that you can just stay in the room

325
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:58,820
From my vantage point am I how far away like what's my new position in the room?

326
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:04,380
You are 20 yards away from the plexiglass which leads you to be

327
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,620
50 yards away from

328
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,780
your

329
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:16,120
Fellow police officers ass fucking room Clark is just gonna look wild-eyed at my officer friends and maybe shaking his head

330
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,120
No, so I need to do sanity

331
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,940
Clark can you roll sanity for me? Obviously? What's

332
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:30,180
Holy shit, I does sanity get a negative if sanity got a negative. I would have a negative. Yeah, let's say no sanity's just

333
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,660
Yeah, let's let's say no, okay

334
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,780
Let's I know cuz in fact

335
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:42,140
I I would even venture to say that being because like exhausted and not quite in touch with reality would make it

336
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:49,220
Yeah, I'm gonna give you a plus 20 while you take no, no, I'm not kidding while you take a negative 20 on everything else

337
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:54,300
Let's do a plus 20 on sanity. Actually, that's kind of fucking dope. Okay, that's a that's a fine trade for me

338
00:27:54,300 --> 00:28:00,100
Yeah, yeah, I like that. I will gladly take a plus 20 to sanity. So you pass I pass either way

339
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:04,020
Okay, so John and Keith you are in cages

340
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,340
alongside a

341
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:10,400
Doug in the FBI body as well as a extremely large

342
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,020
bulgus man and

343
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:17,020
You notice both of us. No, I said bulgus. Okay

344
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,680
Which means like a bulger bulgarious exactly

345
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,540
And

346
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,540
So

347
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:31,820
You would notice this guy actually has a massive tattoo on his back. That says mayhem, which is pretty cool

348
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:36,540
I show him my matching tattoo and a wink just Clark see that from across the room

349
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:41,500
Yeah, you might be able to see that. Am I two feet away from this guy as well? Yeah. Hey, dude, what's your name?

350
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:49,380
Ozzie yes Ozzie. What are you what? How did you wind up in this predicament? Well

351
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,900
You see I am cage fighter

352
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:59,220
Can I do this voice? Yeah, we're not with them anymore. So

353
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,920
He I am cage fighter and

354
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,580
What's your stage name?

355
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:12,860
well, I am Oz mayhem as you may see from my tattoo on my back and my last name is wolf and

356
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,740
my brother Elby, he he owed the glass family lots of money and

357
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:24,260
I went to fight in the scrap pit for him to try to earn this money and

358
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,060
You know, I was quite good. I was quite good at it

359
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:35,900
I still am and I was winning all of this money and my lifestyle became more and more

360
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:41,740
Extravagant until I couldn't afford the lifestyle. I wanted to live any longer and

361
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,780
So as it goes I currently own

362
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,700
Marvin glass a lot of money and

363
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:55,280
So he has me fighting in here as a way to get through this scrap pit is Marvin glass in this room

364
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:00,900
No, I do not think so. He'd like looks around and he's like no I do not see him

365
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:07,540
Do you know who that guy is and I point down to the guy at the bar? Oh, yes, that's Marvin security

366
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:12,380
His name is Kevin. What if I could get Marvin glass a large sum of money?

367
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:19,180
Would he let us out of these cages out of these cages no if he has you in here it is clearly for sport

368
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:25,300
Okay, how many times have you won this? Have you been in this predicament? Yes, but this is easy

369
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:30,260
They mostly throw children at you and that is fine. It is nothing to kill a child

370
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,820
It is much easier than beating down say a planet juggernaut. I

371
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,260
look down at my hands and I

372
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:46,240
Think about the possibility of me having to fight this guy and I start silently sobbing to myself

373
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,100
and

374
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:55,460
Then I look up at the part of the cage that I had found opens and I try my damnedest to open it up

375
00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:01,660
All right, as you begin to fiddle with it your cage begins moving toward the plexiglass

376
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:08,720
Chamber, I mean one other I want to yeah, who's the other cage as you look behind you you see?

377
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,420
John Lee Pettymore's cage is

378
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:18,380
Also moving and the two of you begin to travel. Okay. Can I try the fucking bastard?

379
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:24,340
And I need you to roll your lot picking at 50 at a negative 20

380
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,580
99

381
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,420
Guys these dice have been rolling it real low for me tonight

382
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,260
You

383
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,580
Don't want our us to get our 99 filth on your desk

384
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,500
Keith as you fiddle with your cage

385
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:54,040
You almost get it unlocked and as the cage door

386
00:31:54,340 --> 00:32:01,240
Begins to unhinge and move out of place you feel the most intense burning sensation

387
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:06,520
All over your skin that is touching these metal bars and you take

388
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,760
For damage putting your hit points at what for

389
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:20,520
And your cage attaches and locks into place across from John Lee Pettymore's cage

390
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,720
Which also locks into place in?

391
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,680
between you is a bloody pulpy pool and

392
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,560
your cage doors

393
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,560
open I

394
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,760
Look over John

395
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,560
And get my gun out and I just start shooting

396
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,400
Down at the bottom of the plexiglass to see if I can break a hole into it

397
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,080
I start jumping up and down

398
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,880
I run out of my cage and jump up and down on the spots where he's shot and try to smash through

399
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,960
Yes, yeah fuck yeah, yeah hell yeah that absolutely works they don't think you have a gun

400
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:08,900
Especially an extremely powerful gun that's super small for some reason exactly. I brought probably the best one with me

401
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,280
so

402
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,280
Do I need to roll anything for that?

403
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:13,600
No

404
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,800
You're just shooting a gun into the ground as long as you don't hit yourself actually go ahead and roll

405
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:24,620
Roll me dice and if the if the pair it's at 99 again, you know, that won't we do

406
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,760
Well immediately ricochets under your brain

407
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,800
53 yeah, yeah sure. Okay. So what do you what do you want to happen here?

408
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:38,040
I guess we never really talked about this gun. How many rounds do I hold in this gun?

409
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:44,560
It has as many rounds as until I find plot interesting enough and you current failing enough for you

410
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,320
okay, so I

411
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,320
Petty more and I lock eyes. I

412
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:56,240
Pull out the gun and I just start in a circle shooting and I see as each bullet hits

413
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,720
The plexiglass cracks a little more and petty more sees the cracks

414
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,500
I start jumping up and down and I'm I'm expecting if we go like I'm looking at the motherfucker

415
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,340
I'm trying to land on like so as I fall through I do a

416
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:18,560
Six shots in a circle. He's jumping and I start jumping after that and I am also aiming at a big

417
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Fat ugly motherfucker in a papasan right below me as I'm jumping

418
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,480
I

419
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:30,640
Clark in his cage is losing his mind cheering. This is the best thing he's ever seen

420
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,080
I want you to know the crowd is also

421
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,400
Freaking out and super into this like they are so excited right now

422
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:43,440
Except for like half of them who kind of understand what's happening

423
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,940
Were any of them hit by stray rounds going through the if you're really paying that close of attention

424
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,720
Yeah, absolutely a couple went straight through some noggins and how does the crowd react to that?

425
00:34:53,840 --> 00:35:00,040
They begin lapping up the blood. Yeah. Yeah as the two of you jump up and down

426
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,040
I think three times

427
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:09,160
on that third jump the plexiglass breaks and the two of you on a

428
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,680
circular plexiglass

429
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,440
punctuated

430
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,440
perforated platform land

431
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:21,520
Square on top of the fattest ugliest motherfucker you've ever seen sit in a papasan chair

432
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:28,760
He completely out. Oh, I see you've heard of body flattened before

433
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,160
Watch bodies flat

434
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,520
our slash

435
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,740
plexiglass

436
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,040
That's a fat guy's in a papasan guinea

437
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,580
Oh, so you've been to top post yeah

438
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,140
Yeah

439
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:53,220
So top all time as this happens the crowd begins to go wild and you are now

440
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,480
Amidst this crowd who does not know

441
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:03,020
whether or not to continue to soak up the blood of those who have fallen or

442
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:10,420
To run away in terror. The first thing I do upon landing is aim my gun at Kevin

443
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:15,780
And fire a single shot hoping to hit his chest roll firearms. I

444
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:24,500
Do not pass you shoot right over his shoulder and nailed the bartender who flies back into the mirror on the back of the bar

445
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:32,380
And is crunched up against the bar. Can I take one one more shot? No, John. What do you do? Ah,

446
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:38,260
Okay, give me a second. No, so okay. Well, then I have an answer. I

447
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,860
Just wanted to think of a better one, but John just runs into the crowd

448
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:51,900
John without even taking a look around just like runs at this first motherfucker in front of them and tackles him

449
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:57,180
It's a dude with like an extremely curly mustache and he has a massive

450
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:04,220
Ascot flowing out from underneath one of his vests and you just lay him the fuck out

451
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:08,300
Yeah, I just want to go GTA on as many people in this room as I can until

452
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:12,300
Consequences catch up with me Clark. What are you doing? I want to be spitting them

453
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,980
Be careful

454
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,180
Can you roll a spitting check now, oh

455
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:31,600
Wait, wait, I have an I have a line to add to what I said as he's beating people. He's just like you broke my dick

456
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:39,360
Good, let's take it from the top. Yes. It is a unseasonably warm. I

457
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,880
Want to be Keith this time. Oh, I'll be the goo

458
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:54,640
Okay, as John Lee Pettymore is laying into just any person around him he's just screaming you bastards broke

459
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,640
my dick

460
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,040
Clark who you spitting on everyone

461
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,600
Everyone that's below me. I'm really hawking as hard as I can. I'm doing it out of spite

462
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,680
Maybe maybe I'll get somebody to look up and I'm really trying to spit on them

463
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,560
Wing Jeff

464
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,560
Do you

465
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,520
There's some pretty hard spits too because you're pretty dehydrated

466
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,240
Can I go again or is it everyone else's turn that what happens right now?

467
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,720
It's everyone else's turn and the crowd begins to dissipate

468
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:42,200
There are about five people who are so enthralled with the entire

469
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:47,520
Situation that they are just lapping up the blood on the floor

470
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,980
Snorting it licking at it everything they can do to get others blood in their body

471
00:38:53,480 --> 00:39:01,440
Standing at the bar is Kevin who has not moved Keith. What do you do? I run up to the bar and

472
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:08,920
Try to tackle Kevin. Okay roll unarmed combat at a negative 20. Oh, I think it was gonna be strength, but okay

473
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,560
I've been having some damn bad rolls his luck a thing still

474
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,120
Yeah, I want to spend some

475
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,000
Yeah, dope, okay, so I rolled a 93 woof

476
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,760
So dick, what do I need to do to use some luck here?

477
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:32,600
What is your unarmed combat at a negative 20 20 so you would have to spend 73 luck to get a success?

478
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,760
I don't have that. So just is there anything else I can do? No, okay

479
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:43,800
Well, I mean if you're that desperate, what did you point out determine outcome you use all your points that would take desperation

480
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,800
Yes, okay. I use all of my point

481
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,760
I was just pointing it out. Okay, I don't

482
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,680
Don't do it. I okay. I'll be the devil now

483
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:59,160
I run I run up to I run up to the bar and I see Kevin and I just run at him

484
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,620
And I jump off my feet into the air and trying to just like grab on to him

485
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,620
so he rolled a success and

486
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:14,620
He is gonna use all of that momentum against you as he he reaches forward and also ducks out of the way and

487
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:19,240
slams your head directly into the bar and you take

488
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,980
Six damage, okay

489
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:30,100
Four. Yeah, you're dead. So I am gonna use 30 luck points to avoid death. Hell yeah. Hell yeah

490
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:35,280
First big luck spin to the game. So that puts me at 35 and avoid death

491
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:41,280
But tell me how that works. So basically what happens is you move toward Kevin and

492
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:48,600
Kevin slams your head directly into the bar and you go blank completely unconscious and

493
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,040
You are bleeding out onto the ground

494
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:59,040
He looks down at you and then with completely cold dead eyes just walks away. You're dead

495
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,320
He's just gonna move on. Okay, I

496
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,000
I

497
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,440
Mean you're not dead cuz you spent the light but

498
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:12,400
Essentially, I'm out for the time being you are dead. So what's your look at now? 35

499
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,080
Clark, what do you do? How's the spittin going? Oh, man, you'd like you've hit one out of every ten spits

500
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:23,760
Which is good. It's really good. It's a far distance to spit. You know, you gotta at least get ten yards

501
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,640
You also did just see me get destroyed. So maybe

502
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,480
Maybe you're mad and you do something

503
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:37,680
I do want to try and start shaking my cage and see if I can break the motherfucker off the track

504
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,520
I shake so hard. I shake so hard. I

505
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,400
Vibrate so hard within the cage

506
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,960
No, I want to take both hands on each side of the cage and just throwing my weight back and forth

507
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,960
Do you wait back and forth?

508
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,800
roll constitution first with a negative 20 I

509
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,120
Pass a

510
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,520
13 on a 45 nice

511
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:10,200
So now roll strength because your chest is feeling that tight tight pain that it felt earlier

512
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,360
But you're able to continue and fight through it. I

513
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:21,000
Rolled a 13 again with different dice. I swear to God watching it happen. Everybody can see it's insane

514
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:26,000
You roll better than anyone I've ever met in my entire life. They're all lying

515
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,680
I

516
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,360
Rolled a 73 on the same pair of dice

517
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:38,280
Yeah, I passed it's also at a 45 with the mate with the minus. Okay, you you begin rocking back and forth John

518
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,280
what do you do I

519
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,120
Stop dead in my tracks when I see what happened to Keith

520
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:51,460
And I want to run over to check on him and also get his gun you run over and grab the gun out of Keith's

521
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:59,060
Hand as you do so you look up and you see Kevin who's standing at the bar Kevin can wait

522
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,180
We

523
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,220
Zach wrote that entire

524
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,260
You look in Kevin's eyes and

525
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,780
You get this weird feeling

526
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,020
because

527
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:28,620
You you feel like you know him. It's almost like you recognize him

528
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,620
But you don't you've never seen this this guy before

529
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:37,500
And his cold dead stare straight at you

530
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,820
for just a second flickers and

531
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,100
His eyes change and they look at you

532
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,700
with this

533
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,220
remembering and

534
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,980
Then it is immediately back to these cold eyes

535
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:59,180
I want to try to take the moment that he was off guard to shoot him in the face. Go for it

536
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,180
At a negative 20. Yeah

537
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,340
52 on a 60 so you fire a couple rounds

538
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:11,500
completely shaken not able to even hold this gun steady at all you miss and

539
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:12,580
And

540
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:18,420
He stares at you and then he just runs out of the room as fast as he can

541
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:25,420
John I'm standing you're standing Asian in confusion penis nursing your penis at the bar

542
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:30,940
Can I see what my other cage mates are doing like agent Doug Chad and his mayhem still in his?

543
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:36,260
Yeah, they're both in theirs. They're freaking out there. I mean, they're trying to pay attention. They're looking all around the room

544
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:40,260
Can I yell to Doug Chad? Yeah, sure break out of your cage, man. I

545
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:45,400
Thought about just asking him to do that earlier like Doug get out

546
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,020
It could work

547
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,240
Let's see Doug flips the obvious like lever

548
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:07,380
All right, now what it pulls another lever and it just lowers gently to the floor

549
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,940
Keith you're laying lifeless on the ground

550
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:15,640
Clark is rocking back and forth in this cage

551
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:21,900
hanging next to an empty dark void leading to another room and

552
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,020
John is standing at the bar

553
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:28,260
all the people in this room are

554
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,780
freaking out and

555
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:37,860
Running here and there and the last few of them trail out of the room as you hear a

556
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:47,480
Snap and Clark's cage falls to the ground and breaks open upon impact Clark you take

557
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,060
Eight damage from the fall that puts me out

558
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:59,840
I I too will use 30 points of luck to avoid death. What were you at? Oh seven

559
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:06,100
So now I'm at 45. Look god damn god damn had I not just on a whim

560
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:13,180
Put that gun in my pants. I don't know how oh we would have figured we would have figured it out

561
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:17,300
But I just don't know what it would have been. I would like beating you to death with your forehead

562
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:23,140
I mean you you would you would have killed me because you would have been turned to a goo and then you would have spent

563
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,140
30 luck to come back

564
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,980
How would could we have done that?

565
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,780
What we could

566
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,980
Save this house

567
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,380
But it burns because it's wood

568
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:57,080
Name I smoked all day

569
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,780
You sleep in it all day
