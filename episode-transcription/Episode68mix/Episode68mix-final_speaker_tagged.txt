349.12 399.96 speaker1  it's got to be ivory god damn it that and the smell of the cooking vegetables but he's trying to just focus on breathe just breathe Martin breathe in and out just focus on your breathing ivory would be revolutionary and after he eats the meal he's going to take out a biography of Hannibal Barca the general across the he's gonna kind of look around and see if it doesn't look like things have quieted down outside and if they have he's gonna make his way down to the
395.08 415.64 speaker2  walking around the cottage you come down the stairs after doing a little bit of reading and as you're making your way out to the front door you step on this wood panel beneath you and it is extremely loose to the point to where it
410.24 429.60 speaker1  almost slides out completely god damn I almost slipped on this slidey and loose
424.76 547.44 speaker2  a gym bag there's a gym bag hidden underneath this panel you have to grab another panel and move it to the side in order to get the bag up out of there I get the bag up out of there when you get the bag up out of there you open it up and inside it is filled with cash money there's also a passport there are many cassette tapes and there is a map it's a map of the calm comfy campground with Lake calm and then all of the wilderness around it and the map leads to a spot there's also bottled water snacks and a syringe that is filled with a clear fuzzy cheeks fluffy bags mmm full eyes clear heart of the eyes can't lose looks number 533 Jack Russell 534 Jack Russell 535 was there a stereo a cassette
542.76 552.08 speaker1  take the passport to have leverage he doesn't care about the money he just
547.44 633.60 speaker2  covers that back up there's also the bottled water snacks and syringe filled you cannot for the life of you remember getting here you can like vaguely remember being in your car but then like you don't even remember taking a boat to get on the island you were just standing there at six o'clock not the time the
626.76 645.04 speaker1  position and you don't have any memory of coming to this island if I say gaze
638.48 694.24 speaker2  interesting role some sort of science or survival or anything that you can think you also haven't been up to Jack Russell's apartment and you haven't been in the rest of the main house hmm I think I need to go find that Metallica
690.20 736.48 speaker1  out I keep the tapes in the map but I put everything else back in the hiding spot okay I go and unlock my luggage and lock the tapes back up inside it and good he's still like he's like this place is weird but I've really got a focus for the launch of cube so I'm sorry for the what the launch of cube
730.68 773.84 speaker2  unmolested I'm gonna say something else you do not see anyone on your way out and about and you get to the boathouse and it seems that Jack Russell is up in his apartment and these six canoes are all looking you dead in the face I look I go out on a canoe and you just hear this echo and your back of your head
770.28 882.04 speaker1  he was like very specifically just thinking about like how it did not apply swimmer he grew up in California and did did some nature things he really grew up with an appreciation of California's natural spaces and so yeah you know he now is row out there's not necessarily a middle of this ring like lake but I'm canoe and meditate on cube do you come up with anything I'm starting to second
874.04 896.76 speaker2  inky black water of Lake calm and you see ripples slowly moving toward you he
892.48 933.76 speaker1  feasible because he's only like five foot seven so yeah it doesn't move it around too much when he stands up there but he's yeah any I'd like to have you
929.48 960.56 speaker2  get back there and it's still quiet on all fronts so you can put everything

986.36 1018.28 speaker2  place should look like and you see that the trail that was pointed out to you earlier by Jack Russell if you took that trail you would only need to dip off about halfway through the trail to go off trail to get to where it is marked
1013.84 1103.72 speaker1  that player so true yeah yeah you do have a walk with yeah but not the kind I want he gets really annoyed at other people for not being early enough mystery I guess I do have to find the Metallica kid but but not tonight and some some really nice pajamas oh hell yeah it's a little incongruous with what he's been wearing the rest of the day sure but this is this is some good
1099.12 1296.04 speaker2  of cottage number nine you've got the key in your hand with the little keychain hanging down that says number nine right on it and you're staring at this beautiful little cozy little cottage it's in its own little clearing so there's trees all over but yeah there there's an opening for this cottage to be and you've got a front door and a window in the front seems to be a two-story with loft as the second story from what you can tell outside you said a chimney brick chimney and when you go in it's equally as like rustic and charming and modern as the main big house was and you see that there is a living room there's a study and there's a kitchen and then when you go up the little hungry and you notice that as she's moving around the kitchen she seems to know where everything is she's just like opening up drawers and from upstairs and looking around the bedroom it's just nicely decorated everything is there for you there's I was gonna say there's phone chargers

1612.80 1635.24 speaker2  of literature in this study and you can find really maybe anything that you're
1631.84 1694.52 speaker3  haven't been able to tell by my actions so far he wasn't exactly the one who decided to go on this trip but now that he's here and he really wants to work on this with his wife he's gonna start to embrace this forestry lifestyle like wants to pull down like a local flora and fauna like textbook you can start
1690.48 1764.52 speaker2  the book just kind of slumping onto your belly as you're sitting in this nice is standing outside of cottage number three with his father Alan Grimes who is standing right behind you and the two of you are in this clearing where your cottage is surrounded by all this lush forest green and yeah Alan grabs the key up out of his pocket and is like okay let's go on in and probably call it a night walking in you see a living room there's a study on this floor and there's a kitchen and then there's stairs that go up to a lofted bedroom
1759.08 1790.48 speaker1  fully stocked as I open the refrigerator I look at Alan and I go father would you
1787.36 1819.64 speaker2  gonna go into the other room and you hear him flick on the TV and start
1814.16 1838.00 speaker1  of my body not puke but like just sent back into my mouth and I spit it out and
1834.16 1852.44 speaker2  are flipping from channel to channel to channel to channel at a rapid pace at
1845.76 1870.48 speaker1  no letters on the board and I immediately guess beer battered rock
1865.72 1988.78 speaker2  another channel and when it flips to the next channel the picture is a square instead of a rectangle like is the shape of the TV and the square picture is in black and white and it is the living room entryway of a cottage that looks way into frame and seems to step on something on his way to the front door so in the entryway in between the stairs in the front door Bradley Cooper steps on something and immediately looks down and then you see him get down on his knees and he pulls a wooden plank off of the floor looks into it and then he grabs another wood plank and moves it and then he grabs a black duffel bag out of the floorboards and when he opens it you can't quite see what is inside but then he pulls out this piece of paper that is folded up that he kind of looks at for a second refolds it and puts it back and then he grabs four seven whole shit okay roll a d10 for okay so add four to that skill so take the time right now to explain to the listeners what the deal is with Walter Grimes I gave Walter Grimes 30 skill points on almost everything almost every
1982.82 1996.34 speaker1  skill except everything except like unnatural firearms and unarmed combat
1992.50 2002.48 speaker2  got 30% and everything and I've told you that every time you roll whether you
1996.34 2061.84 speaker1  succeed or fail you learn something and you gain a d10 so right now I've got 30 like I have the same hit hips that I was made yeah you definitely made and Joe
2055.80 2145.40 speaker2  TV screen and somehow the picture clears up enough and where you're looking for you to see that the map that he pulled out is of calm comfy campground and he you just see a name on all of them and then a number afterward and it says Jack Russell number three hundred and and then something now all four of them are we should look around to see if there's cameras like that and and this in this
2140.80 2166.40 speaker1  floorboards aren't completely touching each other and I shove my entire hand down into it some of my silicone skin rips a bit and blood comes out but then
2161.88 2210.00 speaker2  down there you see absolutely nothing and Alan comes up behind you and he's throws it on you and then it's like okay enough of all this nonsense I'm going to bed for the night you did a great job today Walter and I think that you'll do even better moving forward I think we're definitely I think you've convinced them so far and if you can make it through this thing we're on to the next step do
2200.28 2222.24 speaker1  bed and I very mechanically like tuck him in to bed and I place my hand on his forehead good night father I will discontinue soon good night Walter you
2215.52 2234.72 speaker2  can just say you're going to sleep I will go to sleep soon and he is out like
2228.04 2291.56 speaker1  sleep he walks out of the bedroom he takes up the floorboard that he had ripped out earlier places it back where it came from kind of like stomps on it
2287.64 2361.64 speaker2  he's got the key in hand with the nice little keychain rubber with the number cute it's got a little brick chimney and a front door with a window right next to find a living room and that's in the entryway and then back there's a study and there's also a kitchen on the main floor and then up the stairs there's a
2356.72 2661.36 speaker0  about just how how he got here he's wondering if this is all a mistake he's not used to opening up to anybody he's thinking about his past relationship and how she would have enjoyed being at this kind of outdoorsy place and how he being from the city does not particularly enjoy it although he's trying his best sometimes you waking dream where a spider is coming down onto your face I he fucking hate spiders I have that where I literally will have like a right before I wake up it looks like a spider is like from its web like coming down onto my face and I will spring out of my bed and throw my covers off the bed holy grabs it relieved that it is not yeah a little creepy person or something yeah anyway nice and lays back down but he's like staring fucking just dead eyes yeah I'm just gonna leave it on for a while at least until nothing happens and you did not whenever I was okay I assumed I didn't and did I see her with a walkie-talkie earlier which we did not sing with okay say I might I would I would assume that this is that I also take my notebook out of the night drawer absolutely take a couple notes of some spooks and then put that back in lay back down even though I'm like kind of adrenal adrenal eyes adrenaline filled your spooky stuff you're right and then just got fucking scared bro and while would I would lay back down kind of just wondering to myself what the fuck was restless get out of bed look out the window oh and try and look out see if he
2655.48 2682.04 speaker2  search role you'll learn everything you keep searching you get fucking tuckered out staring out this window there's something about the deadness of the night is just wearing you thin and that coffee is not enough to keep you
2675.96 2708.00 speaker0  like laying staring directly up back sleeper what the fuck what the fuck Oh you
