167860	173100	met with James the executive director of calm comfy campground during
173100	178300	orientation a game of two truths and a lie got a little out of hand the group
178300	183500	was then led to the boathouse to meet Jack Russell the boatman he was an odd
183500	188820	guy who warned the group to never go out alone in a canoe on the brackish water
188820	194200	of Lake calm the past doesn't seem nearly as fucked as the present I bet it
194200	199560	definitely stays that way no way things get weirder and weirder and spin out of
199560	207640	control nope so stay calm friends stay comfy turn yourselves down but turn up
207640	213880	that radio it's dream girl with pretty sexual
224200	226200	Oh
244600	251440	hey Thomas Isaac so Bradley Cooper is standing with a key in hand it's just us
251440	255480	you can call him Martin Cooper you're so right Martin Cupertino is standing
255480	259960	key in hand to cottage number five and you're standing right in front of this
259960	264880	beautiful little cottage you've walked down those same kind of a cobblestone
264880	271480	path to get to your cottage and it is by itself secluded by all these trees and
271480	276320	bushes and stuff and it's in a little opening space it's quite lovely and
276320	280840	there's a front door with a window to the side and you are home for the
280840	287840	weekend he eyes it all up and kind of huffs and says cozy and goes in yeah and
287840	294480	when you walk in it is equally cozy inside there is a fireplace and it's
294480	301600	fully decorated in a sort of like not quite lake house kind of decorations a
301600	308600	little bit higher level but it's still rust yeah yeah and so your bags are up
308680	314960	in your room which is on the second level and it's a loft by itself up a
314960	318480	staircase and there's a bathroom attached and then downstairs there's
318480	322600	like a living room there's a little study and there's a kitchen I prepare a
322600	327640	small meal of fresh fruits and vegetables that I bought at a local
327640	332680	market before I came here and while those are simmering I'm meditating on
332680	337000	the floor but not very well because I'm paying attention to the cooking
337000	341080	vegetables what is your mind keep wandering to when you're trying to
341080	349120	meditate I told him I told him it had to be white but I think it should be ivory
349120	355080	it's got to be ivory god damn it that and the smell of the cooking vegetables
355080	361080	but he's trying to just focus on breathe just breathe Martin breathe in and out
361320	370920	just focus on your breathing ivory would be revolutionary and after he eats the
370920	377100	meal he's going to take out a biography of Hannibal Barca the general across the
377100	382480	Alps to invade Rome and he's gonna read that for a while and after some time
382480	386240	he's gonna kind of look around and see if it doesn't look like things have
386240	390520	quieted down outside and if they have he's gonna make his way down to the
390520	395080	boathouse and take a canoe out to the middle of the lake cool so as you're
395080	399960	walking around the cottage you come down the stairs after doing a little bit of
399960	405160	reading and as you're making your way out to the front door you step on this
405160	410240	wood panel beneath you and it is extremely loose to the point to where it
410240	415640	almost slides out completely god damn I almost slipped on this slidey and loose
415640	421240	panel I could sue anyway I guess I'll take a look at it though what's
421240	424760	underneath the panel what's underneath the panel who knows but it is definitely
424760	429600	a gym bag there's a gym bag hidden underneath this panel you have to grab
429600	434440	another panel and move it to the side in order to get the bag up out of there I
434440	438440	get the bag up out of there when you get the bag up out of there you open it up
438440	447320	and inside it is filled with cash money there's also a passport there are many
447320	453720	cassette tapes and there is a map it's a map of the calm comfy campground with
453720	458640	Lake calm and then all of the wilderness around it and the map leads to a spot
458640	465560	far away from here in the wilderness and it is circled and it says the door
465560	472720	there's also bottled water snacks and a syringe that is filled with a clear
472720	478160	substance I am going to pocket the map and with a quick visual estimation how
478160	481760	much money do I think is in here at least 10 grand okay I look at the
481760	489880	passport the passport is for a man named Jack Russell and you'd recognize the
489880	497160	picture as the man who is the boat man I'd recognize those fuzzy cheeks anyway
497160	505080	fuzzy cheeks fluffy bags mmm full eyes clear heart of the eyes can't lose looks
505080	508920	like Jack was ready to get out of here in a hurry do the tapes the cassettes
508920	513640	have any kind of markings on them any like side a of Jack explains the
513640	522640	mystery they're all labeled with like Jack Russell number 532 Jack Russell
522640	530860	number 533 Jack Russell 534 Jack Russell 535 was there a stereo a cassette
530860	535520	player in my room there's not hmm how many tapes are there how many did I just
535520	542560	say it's 64 for four okay pocketable amount yeah I pocket them okay I guess I
542760	547440	take the passport to have leverage he doesn't care about the money he just
547440	552080	covers that back up there's also the bottled water snacks and syringe filled
552080	561040	with a clear substance what kind of snacks rollos combos bugles and a bunch
561040	566280	of nuts and some hard meat okay he takes the nuts and starts snacking on them as
566280	572520	he considers his next move yeah they're pistachios without the shell it's kind
572520	578000	of thing that's gonna make our country lazy Zach loves pistachios without the
578000	583360	show it hurts my hands X lazy Zach's the kind of thing that's gonna make our
583360	590680	country is that is accurate is there an employee parking lot you've seen no cars
590680	601160	how did I get here roll sanity uh-huh I figured it was something like that 51
601160	608520	huck on a 50 god damn it oh okay yeah so go ahead and lose one sanity okay as
608520	616000	you cannot for the life of you remember getting here you can like vaguely
616160	621720	remember being in your car but then like you don't even remember taking a boat to
621720	626760	get on the island you were just standing there at six o'clock not the time the
626760	633600	position and you don't have any memory of coming to this island if I say gaze
633600	638480	out at the far shore of the lake say it this is maybe look like we're moving oh
638480	645040	interesting role some sort of science or survival or anything that you can think
645080	650080	of that would be helpful to produce this just intelligence yeah you can roll
650080	658840	intelligence okay 31 on a 70 the island does not seem to be moving okay okay
658840	664320	there was I didn't notice any stereo or anything at the boathouse no and you
664320	667800	didn't see anything when you're in the lobby or in the meeting room either but
667800	671200	you also haven't been up to Jack Russell's apartment and you haven't been
671200	675560	in the rest of the main house hmm I think I need to go find that Metallica
675560	681560	kid maybe he had a Walkman hell yeah do you remember where he was staying no
681560	686480	absolutely not no he got his room assignment and left went straight there
686480	690200	okay what would you like to do I put everything back well I take the tapes
690200	694240	out I keep the tapes in the map but I put everything else back in the hiding
694240	700680	spot okay I go and unlock my luggage and lock the tapes back up inside it and
700680	706200	then he's gonna go back down to the boathouse and take his canoe okay sounds
706200	710720	good he's still like he's like this place is weird but I've really got a
710720	715280	focus for the launch of cube so I'm sorry for the what the launch of cube
715280	722560	voice in my head cube cube cube it's gonna be huge I've got a launch cube
722560	730560	cube Martin Cupertino as you make your way out to the boathouse you are
730680	736480	unmolested I'm gonna say something else you do not see anyone on your way out
736480	742080	and about and you get to the boathouse and it seems that Jack Russell is up in
742080	747200	his apartment and these six canoes are all looking you dead in the face I look
747200	751880	I'm dead back what are you looking at and I grab a life vest and a paddle and
751880	757680	I go out on a canoe and you just hear this echo and your back of your head
757800	763240	that's why we always sticked it to you in a canoe he actually doesn't hear that
763240	770280	echo the the listener might but as soon as he actually heard that the first time
770280	773840	he was like very specifically just thinking about like how it did not apply
773840	779840	to him are you comfortable on the water he is actually he was a high school
779840	786480	swimmer he grew up in California and did did some nature things he really grew up
786480	791000	with an appreciation of California's natural spaces and so yeah you know he
791000	794760	knows his way around a canoe all right sounds good so you go out on the water
794760	801720	oh god I should have asked for a joint from that girl anyway all I want to do
801720	808000	now is row out there's not necessarily a middle of this ring like lake but I'm
808000	812080	gonna go it's a lifesaver it's a lifesaver donut I'm gonna go to the
812080	817520	middle part of the ring okay you know the thick of the lifesaver yeah as far
817520	825400	from either shore as I can get and I'm gonna paddle out there lean back in my
825400	831320	canoe and meditate on cube do you come up with anything I'm starting to second
831320	841440	guess the whole ivory thing I don't know well I'm coming back to cream bone is
841440	847280	also an option but that's really close to ivory roll alertness for me yes okay
847280	857160	that's not that's a d20 36 39 on a I think I gave myself a little bit here
857160	864240	45 oh nice so when you're out there you decide on cream and at that exact moment
864640	874040	you hear and looking over you see the tail end of something dip down into the
874040	882040	inky black water of Lake calm and you see ripples slowly moving toward you he
882040	892480	assumes a karate stance he stands up in the boat which is it's it's kind of
892480	896760	feasible because he's only like five foot seven so yeah it doesn't move it
896760	901080	around too much when he stands up there but he's yeah any I'd like to have you
901080	905640	rolling athletics yeah honestly it looks like he knows what he's doing what is
905640	909700	your athletics I think it's pretty if it's good enough you don't after all 65
909700	915200	oh yeah then you are good okay he gets into like an Elvis karate pose and he's
915200	920160	like what is this industrial espionage and the lake does not reply he keeps an
920160	929480	eye out for a while and then anything nothing cream won't do any respect you
929480	933760	get back there and it's still quiet on all fronts so you can put everything
933760	940600	back in peace and he does do I see a light on in any of the other cabin we
940600	949480	can't really I was like you don't see anyone I hope
950240	957160	well and if I leave right after this I hope no one sees me go ahead and roll
957160	960560	stealth for me if you're trying to be sneaky that way I have it for oh he's
960560	968040	not honestly he's not no no no he's paying a lot to be here that is yes and
968040	973040	it's a goddamn lake trip and he is very confident it's gonna use the lake he
973040	978960	knows how to canoe he knows karate he's fine yeah he's gonna go back to the
978960	982880	cabin and I'm gonna study that map a little bit does it look like what I
982880	986360	think this place should look like it looks exactly like what you think this
986360	991680	place should look like and you see that the trail that was pointed out to you
991680	996240	earlier by Jack Russell if you took that trail you would only need to dip off
996240	1001600	about halfway through the trail to go off trail to get to where it is marked
1001600	1008520	the door okay what are the odds that I brought a Walkman I want to say zero
1008760	1013840	so I'm gonna okay you have a CD player but you don't have any you know that's
1013840	1018280	that player so true yeah yeah you do have a walk with yeah but not the kind I
1018280	1023880	want he gets really annoyed at other people for not being early enough
1023880	1032760	adapters it's 26 years ago give up the times that was a terrible laugh I'd
1032760	1040200	liked it I was really scared fine I'm kind of getting invested in this
1040200	1046640	mystery I guess I do have to find the Metallica kid but but not tonight and
1046640	1053320	right as he says that a little beeper goes off on his on his watch on a
1053320	1060800	digital watch and he's like ooh bedtime and to sleep you go yep he gets into
1060960	1066640	some some really nice pajamas oh hell yeah it's a little incongruous with what
1066640	1070640	he's been wearing the rest of the day sure but this is this is some good
1070640	1075520	sleepwear high thread count mm-hmm hell yeah
1078400	1084720	hello Joe hello Zach what's up man what's up man what's up dude what's up
1084720	1092840	dude how you live how you live in large as hell large as hell all right so fuck
1092840	1099120	I can't do that you got me Roger and Angela Fairfield are standing in front
1099120	1103720	of cottage number nine you've got the key in your hand with the little keychain
1103720	1106720	hanging down that says number nine right on it and you're staring at this
1106720	1111040	beautiful little cozy little cottage it's in its own little clearing so
1111040	1115080	there's trees all over but yeah there there's an opening for this cottage to
1115080	1119840	be and you've got a front door and a window in the front seems to be a
1119840	1124880	two-story with loft as the second story from what you can tell outside you said
1124880	1129120	just a window it's not like a nice glass or anything like that it's a nice glass
1129120	1133400	little bay window sure okay I got you I'm getting a picture yeah yeah it's got
1133400	1138800	a chimney brick chimney and when you go in it's equally as like rustic and
1138800	1145240	charming and modern as the main big house was and you see that there is a
1145240	1149680	living room there's a study and there's a kitchen and then when you go up the
1149680	1155120	stairs there's the lofted bedroom with a bathroom attached is the kitchen a fully
1155120	1159600	fully equipped kitchen it is fully stocked and as you guys are in there
1159600	1164880	actually Angela starts cooking like immediately she's like I'm just like a
1165040	1171760	little hungry and you notice that as she's moving around the kitchen she
1171760	1175240	seems to know where everything is she's just like opening up drawers and
1175240	1178920	grabbing what she needs honey have you ever have you ever stayed here before
1178920	1183880	have you been to the common comfy campground without me no you seem to know
1183880	1188320	your way around that kitchen pretty dang well oh yeah well it's like this kitchen
1188320	1193120	is set up so intuitively it's like everything is where you expect it to be
1193120	1198880	that's that's handy yeah yeah it's wild what do you want what do they got well
1198880	1204600	I'm making just like an omelet with some bacon and I figured maybe maybe some
1204600	1210080	biscuits make it too all right we'll do I'm gonna go and put on my pajamas and
1210080	1214560	you head off and she continues cooking you can hear kind of humming to herself

1224240	1229640	like ready to go but that's silly I was like what's the nicest amenity I can

1242200	1246360	attached Roger is changing into some really nice silk pajamas oh hell yeah

1262000	1266080	omelet like I said I was going to even though like they kind of split like

1598800	1604080	fucking boom dear but I do want to go downstairs and see if they like you said
1604080	1606880	there was a study right there's a study what kind of what kind of literature
1606880	1612800	that they have in on the bookshelves there's a vast array of different styles
1612800	1619720	of literature in this study and you can find really maybe anything that you're
1619720	1625240	looking for if it's vague enough I would like the history of the calm comfy
1625240	1631840	campground that's for sure not there yeah no no so Roger audience if you
1631840	1635240	haven't been able to tell by my actions so far he wasn't exactly the one who
1635240	1638960	decided to go on this trip but now that he's here and he really wants to work on
1638960	1643600	this with his wife he's gonna start to embrace this forestry lifestyle like
1643600	1649760	half of it is self-help well right well yeah I was gonna say that he gets he
1649760	1654120	wants to pull down like a local flora and fauna like textbook you can start
1654120	1659200	reading about the trees and the plants all around this neck of the woods and
1659200	1665400	he's he's kind of settling into an armchair and trying to put himself in
1665400	1669760	the mindset of a guy who's at a campground and he's reading about trees
1669760	1677960	and you're 15 pages in before you fucking falls there's a chance Roger
1678080	1690480	would be really into it he gets 30 pages in and then with that you nod off with
1690480	1694520	the book just kind of slumping onto your belly as you're sitting in this nice
1694520	1698160	comfy chair I like it
1698160	1708680	hey Luke Kingson oh god thank you that's what yeah I'm sure yes so Walter Grimes
1708680	1714640	is standing outside of cottage number three with his father Alan Grimes who is
1714640	1719200	standing right behind you and the two of you are in this clearing where your
1719200	1726640	cottage is surrounded by all this lush forest green and yeah Alan grabs the key
1726640	1731440	up out of his pocket and is like okay let's go on in and probably call it a
1731440	1736120	night walking in you see a living room there's a study on this floor and
1736120	1740480	there's a kitchen and then there's stairs that go up to a lofted bedroom
1740480	1746720	that has two queen-size beds and a bathroom attached but where does Alan
1746720	1753320	go Alan immediately heads to the kitchen and just grabs some tea and puts on a
1753320	1759080	kettle I walk over to the refrigerator and I open it up is there anything it is
1759080	1764520	fully stocked as I open the refrigerator I look at Alan and I go father would you
1764520	1770520	like me to prepare you any food that would be fantastic what would you like
1770520	1777120	there's pretty much everything you could ask for in here breakfast eggs and bacon
1777120	1781680	yeah sounds good to me so I pull out three eggs some bacon
1781760	1787360	pour them a glass of milk make an omelet and cook up some bacon yeah and he's
1787360	1790480	gonna go into the other room and you hear him flick on the TV and start
1790480	1795800	changing channels with his tea while you do that curiously I break off a little
1795800	1801720	piece of the bacon very crisp by the way I was curious yeah I break off a little
1801720	1808440	piece of the bacon and I put it in my mouth and I chew it I masticate yuck and
1808440	1814160	I attempt to swallow sure and when I swallow it is immediately rejected out
1814160	1819640	of my body not puke but like just sent back into my mouth and I spit it out and
1819640	1826720	in my mind I I think I wish that I could enjoy this like he does and then I bring
1826720	1834160	him his breakfast for dinner as you walk into the room you see that the channels
1834160	1838000	are flipping from channel to channel to channel to channel at a rapid pace at
1838040	1845760	one point Wheel of Fortune comes up sure I see the clue is just things and there's
1845760	1852440	no letters on the board and I immediately guess beer battered rock
1852440	1859640	shrimp and then they spin the wheel and they guess B oh my oh my god that was
1859640	1865680	incredible I wish that this was fun for me as well here you go and he flips to
1865720	1870480	another channel and when it flips to the next channel the picture is a square
1870480	1875920	instead of a rectangle like is the shape of the TV and the square picture is in
1875920	1881600	black and white and it is the living room entryway of a cottage that looks
1881600	1887280	identical to the cottage that you are in so it looks like like video like
1887280	1893320	surveillance surveillance videos what what what is going on I stand there and
1893320	1898800	I just continue looking at the video you see that Bradley Cooper makes his
1898800	1904480	way into frame and seems to step on something on his way to the front door
1904480	1909640	so in the entryway in between the stairs in the front door Bradley Cooper steps
1909640	1914320	on something and immediately looks down and then you see him get down on his
1914320	1919780	knees and he pulls a wooden plank off of the floor looks into it and then he
1919780	1923980	grabs another wood plank and moves it and then he grabs a black duffel bag
1923980	1930340	out of the floorboards and when he opens it you can't quite see what is inside
1930340	1935940	but then he pulls out this piece of paper that is folded up that he kind of
1935940	1939540	looks at for a second refolds it and puts it back and then he grabs four
1939540	1945580	cassette tapes while he does that make me roll something for this but I zoom
1945580	1954400	and enhance with my eyeballs well you get my eyeballs in quotation marks my
1954400	1960340	cameras okay go ahead and roll search
1960340	1967780	seven whole shit okay roll a d10 for okay so add four to that skill so take
1967780	1974220	the time right now to explain to the listeners what the deal is with Walter
1974220	1982820	Grimes I gave Walter Grimes 30 skill points on almost everything almost every
1982820	1988780	skill except everything except like unnatural firearms and unarmed combat
1988780	1992500	yeah and like heavy artillery and shit like that the yeah but besides that has
1992500	1996340	got 30% and everything and I've told you that every time you roll whether you
1996340	2002480	succeed or fail you learn something and you gain a d10 so right now I've got 30
2002480	2012160	on everything except search I now have 34 and surgery I have a 33 fantastic
2012160	2017360	surgery of all things I think when I was like oh I've got a 30 in surgery they
2017360	2020880	were like yeah Thomas was looking at your character she like what the fuck
2020880	2025400	and then I think he saw that you have 30 on everything yeah that's not right
2025400	2031120	because I don't want to give away I'm a freaking robot I leaned into it a little
2031120	2036840	bit but I'm hoping that they haven't I did say something along the lines of
2036840	2043560	like I have the same hit hips that I was made yeah you definitely made and Joe
2043560	2049200	gave me a look of like God like kind of like oh interest and I was like damn it
2049200	2055800	well we'll see if you wrote it down yeah so you zoom in with your eyes onto this
2055800	2061840	TV screen and somehow the picture clears up enough and where you're looking for
2061840	2068320	you to see that the map that he pulled out is of calm comfy campground and he
2068320	2073660	kind of ran his face the island over the island and the the greenery around the
2073660	2078280	island of the lake and he kind of pointed at a point at the top there can
2078280	2082520	I make a mental note for my character of where he pointed to yeah sure it's in
2082520	2089640	the northeast quadrant of the map you also see him pull out four cassettes and
2089640	2096120	you just see a name on all of them and then a number afterward and it says Jack
2096120	2102040	Russell number three hundred and and then something now all four of them are
2102040	2106800	three hundred and something Alan looks at you and he's like we got up I guess
2106800	2111640	we should look around to see if there's cameras like that and and this in this
2111640	2119640	cottage I think you might need to look for cameras and I'm going to look
2119640	2124680	underneath the floorboards by the entrance smart so go ahead and roll
2124680	2132680	search 16 oh you pry up some of the floorboards they're not easy to get up
2132680	2140760	but you well I shove my fingers there's like I find one little spot that the
2140800	2145400	floorboards aren't completely touching each other and I shove my entire hand
2145400	2154760	down into it some of my silicone skin rips a bit and blood comes out but then
2154760	2161880	I have enough grip underneath the floorboard and I pull it up and looking
2161880	2166400	down there you see absolutely nothing and Alan comes up behind you and he's
2166400	2172160	like okay thankfully there are no cameras in this cottage it must just be
2172160	2177320	in that one band-aid oh god oh yes of course and he goes and grabs a band-aid
2177320	2180960	throws it on you and then it's like okay enough of all this nonsense I'm going to
2180960	2185960	bed for the night you did a great job today Walter and I think that you'll do
2185960	2189560	even better moving forward I think we're definitely I think you've convinced them
2189560	2193320	so far and if you can make it through this thing we're on to the next step do
2193360	2200280	you need me to tuck you in yes please I follow Alan to the bedroom he lays in
2200280	2210000	bed and I very mechanically like tuck him in to bed and I place my hand on his
2210000	2215520	forehead good night father I will discontinue soon good night Walter you
2215520	2222240	can just say you're going to sleep I will go to sleep soon and he is out like
2222240	2228040	a light pretty quick Walter stands there watching him until he goes to
2228040	2234720	sleep he walks out of the bedroom he takes up the floorboard that he had
2234720	2240440	ripped out earlier places it back where it came from kind of like stomps on it
2240440	2246520	to like put it in place yeah and then does a little tour of the house just
2246520	2253960	walking around looking at every little piece of each room he goes next to the
2253960	2261400	door where Alan is sleeping he looks down at his shoes he reaches behind his
2261400	2268560	head and presses on a pressure point shirt on his head the matrix spot and
2268560	2277800	his piercing blue eyes turn to completely black and he's out perfect
2281280	2287640	hey Justin hello so Charles Digby is standing outside of cottage number seven
2287640	2291560	he's got the key in hand with the nice little keychain rubber with the number
2291560	2297040	seven on it says calm comfy campground and looking at this cottage it's quaint
2297080	2302280	cute it's got a little brick chimney and a front door with a window right next to
2302280	2306280	it and the front door is painted red because that's nice how calm is it oh
2306280	2311480	dude it's calm as shit you can't hear anything the only thing that you hear is
2311480	2315720	the wind and looking up you see the beautiful stars above you mildly
2315720	2320160	off-putting there's no sounds out here pretty weird to be honest can you hear
2320160	2326800	crickets no you cannot unsettled so when you go into the cottage you are going to
2326800	2331360	find a living room and that's in the entryway and then back there's a study
2331360	2335240	and there's also a kitchen on the main floor and then up the stairs there's a
2335240	2339440	lofted bedroom with a bathroom attached I'm gonna go to the kitchen and make
2339440	2344720	myself a little cup of coffee for sure anything in it no just black absolutely
2344720	2351400	sad coffee sad coffee my favorite kind personally sad coffee for a sad boy
2351400	2356720	what's Charles thinking about as he's going through here Charles is thinking
2356720	2361640	about just how how he got here he's wondering if this is all a mistake he's
2361640	2366000	not used to opening up to anybody he's thinking about his past relationship and
2366000	2370840	how she would have enjoyed being at this kind of outdoorsy place and how he being
2370840	2375240	from the city does not particularly enjoy it although he's trying his best
2375240	2379560	with your cup of coffee are you going straight to bed are you the type to take
2379560	2384480	caffeine right before sleep yes this is this is like kind of his nightly ritual
2384480	2389240	gotcha he does the whole like slug down some coffee and then lay down and try to
2389240	2394560	fall asleep let your brain just go yeah it's weird so as you're laying there
2394560	2400400	staring up at the ceiling ceiling fan going around and round and round five
2400400	2405800	blades on the ceiling fan you kind of like focus your eye on one of them as it
2405800	2416680	goes and then you hear from underneath the bed hello is it like someone the
2416680	2420360	floor below me it does not sound like it's on the floor below you it sounds
2420360	2424840	like it is under the bed I like immediately like like I just like get
2424840	2429420	out of bed like freak out cover like fling covers off like like you know how
2429420	2432720	sometimes you waking dream where a spider is coming down onto your face I
2432720	2436040	don't know if I'm the only person who has this all the time you could ask Joe
2436040	2440080	he fucking hate spiders I have that where I literally will have like a right
2440080	2444080	before I wake up it looks like a spider is like from its web like coming down
2444080	2449280	onto my face and I will spring out of my bed and throw my covers off the bed holy
2449280	2454320	shit I've literally never sprung out of bed it's bad sometimes I get sprung in
2454320	2464880	bed just like like a knee-jerk reaction of like what the fuck and like look
2464880	2467760	under under look under the bed immediately yeah under the bed there is
2467760	2475760	a little walkie-talkie down there and it goes hello oh fuck okay and then he
2475760	2481400	grabs it relieved that it is not yeah a little creepy person or something yeah
2481400	2488120	that would be worse activates it and like hi oh oh hello sir who is this oh
2488120	2495640	you know is this Charles Digby this is he who are you oh I just wanted to know
2495640	2500600	if you figured it out yet what what am I supposed to be figuring out the reason

2536120	2541240	staring at it just waiting kind of you don't turn it off you leave it on yes
2541240	2545240	yeah I'm just gonna leave it on for a while at least until nothing happens and
2545240	2549960	then maybe I'll turn it off to try and get some sleepies eventually but he's
2549960	2557440	very perturbed yeah seemingly was this a young girl's voice maybe it was a young
