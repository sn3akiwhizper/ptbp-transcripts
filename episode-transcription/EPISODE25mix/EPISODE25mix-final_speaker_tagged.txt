0.00 203.00 speaker0  Hello my hungry babies, it's your chef Wolf the dog, and I'm here to serve you up some real tasty news grub cooked up right here in contention. Now don't let the local health inspector know that I cook all my grub with a microwave here at 694.2 PTBP. A microwave is the only way to get that real good flavor from the rats I catch down here in the basement. This week Wolf is here to reiterate to y'all that we are going to have a special presentation in a few weeks here on 694.2 PTBP, contention's newest and only radio station. We're going to broadcast a recap episode with listener Q&A from a podcast called Pretending to be People. If you have questions for any of the fine people on that show, act quickly, deadline is May 7th at noon Central Time y'all. Or go all out, record that audio of you asking your question and send that so they can use it in the episode my babies. But enough with that which is fictional, it is time for the news. The officers met back at the contention police station early in the morning of December 5th along with Drew and their new partner in crime Rosemary, an actual member of the Glass crime family. In the station, an FBI agent named Trent Chad was sorting through contention's paperwork, Clark shot him with a dart and agent Trent Chad became very very impressionable. With agent Trent Chad's newfound pliability, the officers worked out ways in order to convince the public as well as the feds that the local authorities have everything under control in contention. But of course y'all, nothing could be further from the truth. The officers found the cells holding Dr. Marie Jacobs and her cat man to be empty. Upon checking the security footage, they confirmed the black ooze slammed the two jailbirds into the ground of their cells before disappearing entirely. Keith blurted out that the camera will be ready to use at 1pm. They checked the evidence room and saw a single green light beaming from the old glass tube covered radio. Seems like a pretty shitty radio to me. Wolf the dog always has the green light and it's always go go go with kudzu's no backbone.
202.00 210.00 speaker1  I said you're fat. Oh, because she was pregnant.
205.00 216.00 speaker2  Because she was pregnant. It was an attempted twist on the thing and it didn't work.
212.00 221.00 speaker1  You looked like you wanted to be anywhere else in the world.
216.00 230.00 speaker2  I still remember the look of just like as your face fell and her face fell.
228.00 235.00 speaker1  I can hear it coming out also.
230.00 238.00 speaker2  It was so funny because I used to bet it didn't work.
236.00 252.00 speaker1  It didn't work because I used to **** with her. What's her name?
249.00 262.00 speaker2  What? I just don't speak in public anymore.
260.00 270.00 speaker1  Okay, let's play this game.
268.00 304.00 speaker2  It's December 5th. So what we're going to do is we're going to roll constitution for more hit points. Cool. You guys have been fucked up by a lot of different stuff, but mostly that fight with a big robot man. Yeah, so I've failed.
303.00 314.00 speaker1  Okay. I did not do current. Yeah, I got a nine, so yeah.
312.00 317.00 speaker2  Why is your constitution different now than- It's not. Your con should never-
316.00 325.00 speaker1  Oh, yeah, it doesn't change. I was looking at current hit points. It doesn't change. Right, right.
324.00 336.00 speaker2  Yeah. Can I go to the doctor or something? So John gets one hit point back. Keith gets one D4. So you want to roll a D4 if you pass. Clark, pass or fail?
335.00 338.00 speaker1  He passed.
337.00 341.00 speaker2  So you guys both get a D4 hit points. Fuck.
340.00 344.00 speaker1  And I rolled a D4. Clark gets one.
342.00 351.00 speaker2  And Keith gets- Two.
349.00 352.00 speaker1  My current is 12.
351.00 363.00 speaker2  Oh, word. You were worse than me. I'm at eight. Shit. I thought I was doing that at 12. Now I'm at 13. Yeah, because somebody fell on my face.
361.00 376.00 speaker1  Well, some idiot hadn't been lying in the road.
369.00 384.00 speaker2  And when you don't get a full night's sleep, you automatically get reduced to two willpower points. To two. So all of you are now at two willpower.
383.00 387.00 speaker1  I was at five.
386.00 430.00 speaker2  Do I go up to two? So with you- What the fuck? addicted to cocaine now. Oh, yeah. Mostly, Keith. So you're all at two willpower. Keith, I'm going to go ahead and give you two willpower. So I'm at two total. So how this works is you are all- Sleepy. Sleepy and completely having basically an emotional breakdown, physical as well. So you're all going to take a negative 20% to all roles until you either fix your willpower or do an upper.
427.00 435.00 speaker1  How long do we have to sleep to fix our willpower?
431.00 445.00 speaker2  Not even a cat nap or whatever won't bump it up a few points. That does make sense because when I'm feeling down and I get even an hour, I do feel better.
443.00 447.00 speaker1  You get two or three more hours after that. Cool.
446.00 462.00 speaker2  Let's take a nap. I don't understand. No. So basically you roll at minus 20% on all roles when you either have one or two willpower. Oh, cool. Okay. So if you gain any willpower, you won't be at that negative anymore. Cool.
461.00 467.00 speaker1  Okay. How's that sound? Are you sleeping in drugs to gain willpower back? Different drugs?
466.00 469.00 speaker2  Different drugs? No.
468.00 480.00 speaker1  Yeah. Well, okay. So I'm going to do some cocaine.
474.00 530.44 speaker2  So it is 6 a.m. on December 5th and all three of you are reeling from the events of last night. The dreams you cannot quite understand and the revelations of the morning. You all stand in the evidence locker looking at the camera, gun, radio, and helmet all with strange glass tubes making them look like they came from a weird old-timey steampunk laboratory. The camera, gun, and helmet each has a glowing red light giving this small room an eerie tent. thigh climbing and then you hear a meow and notice Doug, the cat previously called Salem, has walked into the room and is pawing at you. Oh my God.
529.44 548.82 speaker1  How did we communicate with him? One meow for yes. Two for no. Yeah. What should we ask him? That was me. Oh. It looks like he wants to talk to Keith. Hey. Meow? Meow. Shit.
547.82 551.82 speaker2  It's yes or no questions. How you doing? Meow.
550.82 562.82 speaker1  Meow. Help me out here, guys. The cat jumps up onto- Okay. Me.
561.82 574.82 speaker2  You go. Shut up, Thomas. Shut up, Thomas. Stupid piece of shit.
573.82 576.82 speaker1  Oh, dude.
575.82 578.82 speaker0  Clark is running out of the room.
577.82 584.82 speaker2  You're going to switch a body. Clark, when you run out, you see Agent Tramp. He's like, what? What's going on?
583.82 600.22 speaker1  What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? What's going on?
591.82 615.94 speaker2  You see Agent Trent Chad still mopping up his Red Bull spill and Drew is sorting through all these different files and Rosemary, whose name you now know, the Fonzie lady, she is just standing in the middle with her arms crossed and tapping her foot.
614.94 619.10 speaker1  You do so.
615.94 646.42 speaker2  Doug, are you trying to body swap with us? When the cat looks at you and you're holding it, I need you to roll a dexterity real quick because Doug freaks the fuck out when you grab him. Oh, I pass. Eight. Okay, then you can describe as he is looking at you and meowing and losing it.
642.64 652.66 speaker1  out blind and just grabs him and brings him out and then the same thing happens again and then finally I just press him tight to my chest and I look him dead in his little cat eyes. He looks horrified.
651.66 660.62 speaker2  What do you say?
658.78 706.78 speaker1  can't be trying to steal ours. Maybe Chad's later, but not right now. We kind of need you to just, well, actually maybe right now. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. I was thinking Rosemary, but she has knowledge that we need. We need Rosemary, yeah. Yeah. Let's do it with FBI guy. All right. Do you want to be in a presumably hunky FBI agent's body, Doug? I don't want to be in that room when that radio goes off. that radio? All in favor, say aye. Clark is out of the evidence.
705.06 709.78 speaker2  Clark is out of the evidence room right now. That's true.
708.78 723.18 speaker1  Let's just do it. Let's just do it. Okay. I walk out into... Keith, is it, is it you? It's me. I'm not, I am me. We've got a plan though. Bubblegum tree. I'm going to walk out too.
722.18 726.18 speaker2  Bubblegum tree. Wait.
725.18 753.26 speaker1  So you didn't switch bodies with him? No, but we got a plan. Is John? No, John is still John. He's Bubblegum tree. But here, come here. We're going to switch Chad's body with Doug's body. We're going to put Chad in the cat. Don't, don't tell him though. Okay. I mean, does Doug, is Doug okay with that? He meowed. He meowed. He meowed for yes.
752.26 765.82 speaker3  What is? Okay. I really, I really liked the idea, but he, Doug doesn't know the FBI. Like we have to have somebody tell the FBI not to come back here. Uh, we'll just text it from his phone.
764.82 799.64 speaker1  Yeah. Says, Hey, listen, I'm not, I'm heading up to the city for the afternoon to do a little sightseeing and I'll be back tomorrow. Cause the contention situation is locked down and we can keep them distracted for a little while because we can just tell Doug what to say cause he'll have Chad's voice. Oh shit. Yeah. We just use Doug. Hey, can we fight Chad right now? I don't think we need to. No, no, no.
798.12 810.28 speaker2  Agent Chad looks up.
809.28 821.92 speaker1  big and sign. Uh, maybe later, Chad, you just go close your little eyes. Now you just take a little nap immediately.
816.12 831.56 speaker2  Chad, while mopping up his red bull spill, which he's been doing for like 10 minutes now, he just closes his eyes and lays down on the ground. All right, let's drag him into the room.
830.56 835.56 speaker3  Sure. I helped. I helped the dragon.
834.56 847.86 speaker1  Yeah.
840.38 850.86 speaker2  like squeezing his eyes closed to make sure that he like is staying consistent with your hopes and dreams. Yeah.
849.86 859.54 speaker1  Hell yeah.
853.82 864.34 speaker2  This cat is just like walking back and forth meowing just like Doug, we're going to leave
862.62 869.26 speaker1  We'll be back in a moment. I'm yeah.
865.34 876.36 speaker3  As soon as I'm like across the threshold with the body as far into the door as I can, I'm stepping over it and out of the door. Yep. Say, Hey guys, real quick.
872.58 891.46 speaker1  Do you think that, well, I guess it would only be beneficial to us if Doug was still Yeah. I was going to think that could be a hindrance, but it'd actually be a great on hindrance for sure.
890.46 908.98 speaker3  that stuff. Yeah. I put my ear to the door.
906.98 918.94 speaker1  What do we hear?
914.98 985.98 speaker2  One last time. You hear police department of contention. And then you hear the song start to change and you overhear audio that does not make any sense to you that gets louder until it becomes a jumble and there is a high pitched noise just screeching in all of your ears. As you hear a massive, massive noise and a light flashes brightly from all crevices of the door. And you hear from inside the evidence locker
984.98 998.74 speaker4  All right. Oh, all right. Whoa. Oh shit. Oh fuck.
997.74 999.74 speaker3  Oh man.
998.74 1020.46 speaker4  Oh man. Oh, Doug.
1018.82 1047.02 speaker2  open up the door for me? Also inside is a cat laying on the ground. Is the cat alive? The cat wakes up, seemingly opens its eyes, looks around, looks at itself, starts freaking out and makes a run for the door. I'm going to try to do a decks check.
1046.02 1059.10 speaker1  Close the door. And also who's got the best decks. I have 60, 65, 60. cat patrol. All right.
1058.10 1064.38 speaker2  Go ahead and roll first. Keith to give, uh, to give John a plus 20.
1063.02 1074.14 speaker1  I got a 33. All right.
1072.28 1078.86 speaker2  the door slamming from inside.
1077.64 1080.86 speaker4  You want it?
1079.86 1082.86 speaker2  And Oh God.
1081.86 1125.22 speaker4  Oh fuck. Yeah. Okay.
1121.38 1129.92 speaker1  sure there's no way anybody's living here until we want them to, Hey, Hey, what's going on in there?
1128.92 1136.58 speaker2  In a minute. We're dealing with some others.
1135.58 1138.58 speaker1  What do you need?
1137.58 1154.10 speaker2  Okay.
1153.10 1168.50 speaker4  Yeah. No, no, no.
1162.90 1172.86 speaker2  his keys and turns around and runs out of the police station. Cool.
1170.50 1239.06 speaker1  I locked the door behind him. Let's get Doug in here. Where's the gun, John Rosemary, you give us one fucking minute. We're dealing with some body switching shit here. More crazy. The kind of stuff your boss is interested in, but like right now you're not necessarily our number one priority. It's the guy who just switched bodies with the cat. Okay. Well, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. goddamn horses here. Open the door up and let's Rosemary, you can see all this. You're about to. Yeah, you'll see it. You're like a mob enforcer. We're just letting hang out in our police station. She doesn't have a car here. She also doesn't have a gun.
1238.06 1241.74 speaker3  Yeah.
1240.06 1255.30 speaker1  Doug, Rick, we might have to deal with something real quick. Uh, just to double check. Do you feel compelled to acquiesce to our desires? Is that what you would like me to do? Cool, cool, cool. Hold on to that cat. We'll be right back. And I run out after Rosemary.
1253.34 1262.42 speaker2  What are the two of you doing, Clark and Keith?
1261.42 1264.42 speaker3  Yeah. I'll follow John out.
1263.42 1279.22 speaker1  Okay. Rosemary. Rosemary, wait.
1275.46 1283.78 speaker2  Rosemary is standing behind, banging on the trunk.
1281.82 1293.20 speaker1  I pull my gun and point it at her.
1291.78 1317.50 speaker4  come right back inside. It's all fine. Okay. Everything's fine. I'm going to come right back inside. Just open up the trunk, Drew.
1311.54 1338.54 speaker2  She reaches in and pulls out a briefcase, closes the door, hits the back of the trunk And then starts walking back toward you guys. And she's just holding a metal briefcase and walking toward you.
1337.30 1355.82 speaker4  It's not yours. It is now. No, thank you.
1353.94 1373.14 speaker3  I've got no fucking clue what's going on.
1368.74 1401.98 speaker1  by American rules. Is she our new chief?
1400.10 1407.62 speaker2  Oh man, we can finally get that. We can buy the Nat soundboard.
1406.62 1427.34 speaker1  We can hire... Nice. Nice. Nice. We just have professional voice actors that we dictate everything we speak of. What we've been doing is a rough draft. It's a rough script. Yeah, we're going to have...
1425.54 1443.30 speaker3  It's the pilot season.
1441.26 1462.50 speaker1  John also goes back inside.
1456.42 1479.86 speaker2  and he looks at his hands and he's like, wow, everything is very weird.
1477.78 1488.62 speaker4  God, oh my God.
1484.58 1491.62 speaker2  moving and just dodging and trying to run away. There's the ooze.
1490.62 1509.20 speaker4  The ooze is here, guys. The fucking ooze. Water, water, water.
1504.30 1525.66 speaker3  I grab the biggest container I can find, probably a bowl, but if not a cup, fill it with water and I'm throwing it over my shoulders close to Doug as I can.
1524.66 1528.66 speaker4  It's right there. Don't let it touch you.
1527.66 1539.34 speaker1  Where's he pointing to? Are we getting close? Am I hitting it with water?
1538.34 1557.58 speaker3  Uh, I'm sorry. Cause there's no way I would know. Am I hitting them where he's pointing with water? the, the side of the half of a room.
1556.58 1581.18 speaker1  No real separation. You know what I can picture? That. Cool. Open the cabinet doors up and break the pipe off. Yeah.
1579.20 1646.22 speaker2  police department. Doug is still freaking out and sprinting about and Drew does not know or Drew's not there. Rosemary has absolutely no idea what's going on. style holding the briefcase. It's called crisscross applesauce now. I am so sorry. Fuck. Doug get, get to the water. He runs over and joins you and stays calm. The water is not stopping it. And he sprints around the outside of the room and heads for the front door of the police
1641.58 1661.50 speaker1  Doug, if you head outside, please just remain right there and wait for further instruction. I think I run after him. I think I do too. Like out of scare.
1655.82 1670.62 speaker2  So you're going to try to find your little vacuum and Keith and Clark are running after
1669.62 1679.58 speaker1  Following the same path that he took. Same. Yeah.
1673.62 1687.14 speaker2  As you get to the front door, you see him standing in the parking lot and I need whoever has the worst luck to roll luck right now for me.
1686.14 1690.14 speaker1  45. 65.
1689.14 1692.14 speaker3  Did you mean of all of us?
1691.14 1697.74 speaker2  I know what you meant. I didn't hear you say oh.
1696.74 1715.22 speaker1  Motherfucker. 33. That's two 33s tonight. Yeah, that is.
1712.02 1738.10 speaker2  the middle of the parking lot of the police and contention. The fuck.
1736.10 1748.38 speaker4  I don't see anything.
1746.58 1751.94 speaker3  We need you to tell us if it's here.
1749.38 1768.62 speaker4  I can't see anything. I don't know what's going on anymore. It's just real.
1765.78 1779.10 speaker2  Snot is just pouring out of his nose. He's like kind of spitting on the ground and he's like, I just don't know. The Cruiser is indeed.
1778.10 1787.90 speaker3  Okay. Hey Keith, let's get him up into your car, man.
1786.90 1796.90 speaker1  Let's put him in the back.
1793.74 1807.62 speaker3  I want to know for sure what he sees.
1805.54 1815.58 speaker2  He's weeping as you get him to the police cruiser. I would like to persuade him not to weep. I'm kidding. I'm not even in. Let's cut back to John in the police department. You find a vacuum.
1814.58 1850.78 speaker1  What are you doing with it? Well, so not being able to see anything, I'm just like dancing from side to side, like jumping back and forth and just like stabbing out in the air with this little dust devil.
1843.18 1861.38 speaker4  chuckling shut up, Rosemary, John, you look stupid. Damn it.
1858.54 1874.14 speaker2  a head into hands and he's breaking down.
1873.14 1884.30 speaker3  He does so. Okay. I wanted to make sure he was still under the influence. Okay.
1880.50 1899.88 speaker1  He's a man who became a cat who became a different man.
1898.62 1925.26 speaker3  I start petting him on the back. Get it out bud. Get it out.
1922.98 1943.26 speaker2  And I was so cold.
1942.26 1954.16 speaker1  That's not true. I think we have a pretty good idea where she is. The upside down. He looks up at you guys.
1952.46 1985.34 speaker4  Why is this happening?
1975.36 2006.98 speaker2  in this radio is that radio, that fucking radio and she turned it on and I, I don't know. Then it's just flashes. I was cold. I was in the water. I mean, I was running away from this. It felt like a dream. I think I was dreaming and then he, uh, he looks up and he, he catches a glimpse of himself
2005.86 2009.98 speaker4  This is a dream. This is a dream.
2008.98 2021.58 speaker2  I'm going to dream. You're in a dream. Everything's fine. I'm just going to wake up and everything's going to be fine. You're fine. It's fine. Everything's going to be fine.
2020.58 2096.46 speaker3  I look at Keith. Hey Doug, you're right. This is, this is just a crazy dream and as soon as it's run its course, you'll wake up next to Marie and everything's going to be all right. But for now, why not give us as much help as you can? What's the worst that could happen? It's just a dream. When we, when you were in that cat body, you seemed real confident when we asked you if you knew how to use the radio to switch bodies back. She just turned it on. So you, you, is there a chance we, you could have switched bodies with any of us as far as you know, or did you know that you were going to go into the detective's body somehow? The detective? I'm sorry. Uh, the body that you're in right now. So you didn't like think real hard about wanting to be that body on the floor or anything
2095.22 2098.46 speaker4  what's that even mean?
2097.46 2151.02 speaker2  Sure. Cutting back to in the police department, John, you're, you're vacuuming around and seen before ever in the police department. And it has a little plaque on it, placard that just says, uh, agent Chad on it. And as you're going about your business, uh, you notice that on one of the desks.
2147.02 2216.34 speaker1  Does a goo monster eat me roll now? You're good. Okay. I take a breath. I'm standing there for maybe like 15, 20 seconds. And then I go over to the, once I'm sure the coast is clear, I go over to the case. Uh, why'd you stop dancing? I think that might've been some kind of illusory goo monster, but I'm not really sure. Oh yeah, totally. We're dealing with a man who had his brain transferred into a cat. Yeah, that all adds up. More like his consciousness. Sure. You're such a dick, Rosemary. No, it's not locked. What has Chad been up to?
2215.34 2264.82 speaker2  Four specifically. But the first thing is a bunch of signs. Rosemary, I think it's a sign. It's a bunch of these signs. and it is turned on. It's strawberry. Cutting back into the parking lot.
2263.82 2271.42 speaker1  Okay.
2269.02 2294.26 speaker2  He's crying a bit. He's crying a bit, but you guys get him in. What do you see, Doug? Got a wet floor though, seemingly. And then he kind of walks over to where you guys just were in the mirror above the sink and he just stares in it and he starts feeling his face.
2292.66 2300.26 speaker3  What you looking at there?
2295.30 2346.86 speaker1  So, Agent Chad had some weird stuff in his briefcase. You should probably take a look at this. I was just going to say we might be careful though in case he had some like, since the animals seem to have been able to see the goo and maybe he just had some residuals from being a cat, that goo might still be in here.
2341.58 2358.38 speaker2  It's, uh, I don't know if you were aware of this, but you're in my dream right now, where I'm another person, which is nuts, uh, so, you know.
2353.66 2368.90 speaker1  No, I don't think I've ever had a dream where I wasn't myself, but, uh, here is a little dust devil in case you get the wheelies again and then you can scoop, you can scoop it up. You can scoop up the, with the dust devil?
2367.90 2380.74 speaker2  All right. And then he grabs it. All right. He just kind of rubs it, keeps looking in the mirror. He's, he's really, you know, as one might be when in a different body, he is fascinated by his reflection.
2379.74 2410.74 speaker1  Yeah. As you guys probably saw, Chad had this, these signs to put up all over town, uh, saying attention a chemical spill from the unincorporated land. Once the town perdition just west of contention is heading this way, please evacuate immediately. Don't forget your pets. There's this list of all the places he was going to post the signage at. It's all, it's all the main hotspots in town here.
2408.78 2432.70 speaker3  Everybody gets to read a little something. Uh, yeah, he's also, uh, got this map here. It's it's color coded showing all the missing persons and the days that they all left.
2428.22 2445.18 speaker1  There's a couple of dots on December 1st, three on the second and then an explosion on the third. That's correct. Yeah. So if you get a chance to study that list, is there anything out of the ordinary?
2444.18 2456.74 speaker2  Okay.
2454.58 2466.74 speaker4  Probably didn't have a chance yet to go to any of them.
2465.74 2483.82 speaker1  Rosemary. Clearly he hadn't put the signs up yet. and there are no checkmarks.
2482.82 2485.82 speaker3  I'm sorry. I cut you off.
2484.82 2491.18 speaker1  I said what I needed to say.
2489.90 2494.46 speaker3  We all got that pretty quick. Yeah.
2492.18 2507.34 speaker4  It's just been a while since I talked to him.
2505.94 2518.98 speaker1  Mama's love us all. What do we do now guys? Well, I would still like to talk to the, uh, the big guy in the city with Rosemary here. Well, what should we do with Doug? Well, Doug is a very useful tool.
2517.98 2523.94 speaker3  Yeah. We want him to stick with us for as long as possible at this point.
2521.58 2617.50 speaker1  Also seems like we could probably get more information out of them. of seems safer than being in a town with a goo monster, but Clark or Clark. Hey Clark. crime family. He sent his two boys down there, Marvin glass, sent his two boys to go collect that money after Peters had already come in to possession of the artifacts and some magic fuckery happened. One of the boys disappeared, Jermaine Jermaine. The other one is a babbling idiot just talking about that gun now, Alfred, gun boy. So that's really all Rosemary knows is that she's supposed to come down here and get this gun gun and take it back to, uh, the Marvin glass boss. Yeah. And after we got to talking, I was thinking that, you know, perhaps we could recruit this Marvin glass and his army of games to help us out down here in exchange for maybe getting his boy back from the upside down.
2616.50 2637.26 speaker3  bargaining chip, right? I mean, that's what we're bluffing, right? We don't know where the gun works.
2634.78 2661.42 speaker1  my whole pitch to Mr. Glass. It's like, Hey man, there's some weird supernatural shit happening. And uh, if you want your boy back, we could really use any operational assistance your organization could provide that comes without the pesky oversight of say the FBI. So I thought maybe he could pitch in and would have a strong motivation to do so. I E it's child.
2660.42 2672.86 speaker3  I don't know. It sounds risky, but if you think you can do it, the manpower would be helpful.
2671.86 2682.86 speaker1  goo. It's already taken so many people.
2681.86 2693.26 speaker2  Yeah. Okay.
2691.42 2723.64 speaker1  Was this talk of the chemical spill? That's probably just a cover up. Is it a cover up or is there some truth to it? Something happened in Perdition. I also think maybe it's not a bad idea to just go ahead and post those around town to save more people. Yeah, for sure.
2722.48 2724.64 speaker3  just now gotten?
2723.64 2727.52 speaker1  That would not be a bad idea. We could have Doug do that right now.
2726.52 2751.84 speaker3  Hopefully. Yeah. Hey Doug. Yeah. Come over here for a second. Sure. Can you, uh, here, let me, let me just write it down and I write down exactly what I want him to say. Okay. Would you mind reading this into this recorder here for us and just, just read it as naturally as you can. But hit me with it. I don't know what it's going to say.
2748.32 2755.88 speaker1  just west of contention is heading this way, please evacuate immediately. Do not forget your bets.
2754.12 2760.60 speaker2  Let me give that a go.
2759.60 2776.56 speaker3  Once again. Yeah.
2771.02 2801.52 speaker2  contention is heading this way, please evacuate immediately. Don't forget your pets. And say the boys in blue are here for you. You know, Doug, you, you went a little off script at the end, but you really got the
2800.52 2831.38 speaker1  like Chad. That's awesome.
2825.92 2880.78 speaker2  So a couple, I was going to say a couple of things are going to happen. Okay. So you have Doug record that message and pretty immediately you see Rosemary is getting a
2878.14 2893.06 speaker1  and I think we're going to move things towards getting you that gun. Can you hold on real quick while I confer five minutes? All right. Yeah, me too. That would not have been enough for minutes. Oh, you don't know what a minute is. You're real dumb.
2892.06 2894.14 speaker4  Three minutes.
2893.06 2918.48 speaker1  Oh no. Why did Marvin glass and trust you with this last few minutes?
2917.48 2920.48 speaker3  Now I get it. Yeah.
2919.48 2970.84 speaker1  Yeah. to go to. Would we know, would you be able to swing by the unincorporated land quite easily on your way to the city from contention? Couldn't be more in the opposite direction. Guys, that couldn't be more in the opposite direction. That well, yeah, but I mean, I think Tom is of the essence. She's not going to like kill us. And if she does, she'll only kill one of us. You can't hear this Rosemary. We're talking. Out of your shot. She just overheard laughter.
2969.06 2973.92 speaker2  She just follows shit posters. She's watching puppy cuts.
2972.92 2982.38 speaker1  What do you think? Well, I'd like to go. You boys don't have to come with me, but, uh, it might be more convenient for recording purposes.
2981.38 3016.98 speaker3  Yeah. Uh, Joe's at a pickle there. I don't think Clark would go at all. He'd be afraid of the mob and feel like we have to take care of shit here, but I also don't want to be away from them for a long time. It could be if you guys go to the city and all that shit. Hey John, how about can we, can we, can we ask Rosemary to give us the morning to put up these signs and get in touch with dog and get the radio broadcast out and then maybe we could run up there and run up to city.
3014.90 3034.72 speaker1  bargaining position here. Right. Cause it's three men in this office with guns. So and we have the one thing that she wants. Yeah, that's exactly right.
3033.72 3060.08 speaker3  Joe didn't think of that. Clark probably would have cause that's a very good idea. There's no reason that we need to do that personally. What did we forget?
3059.08 3064.86 speaker1  The minus 20.
3063.86 3068.10 speaker2  So that's true. Oh man.
3065.86 3074.90 speaker1  I need to be a better handler. Also my, like it wouldn't have affected, I think I've done two roles because it rolled
3073.90 3086.70 speaker2  Okay.
3084.70 3090.88 speaker4  Get on out.
3089.50 3108.20 speaker3  She didn't walk over to us. I just pulled John in a little closer. I think she can hear us.
3107.20 3116.32 speaker4  No. All right.
3115.32 3154.80 speaker1  Yeah. Rosemary, we need an hour in contention before we can leave. Is that all right? Keep in mind we all have pistols and the one thing you want in the world and the one thing your boss wants in the world. Your boss is a pretty scary dude. So consider this hour your entire fucking life. Yeah. I mean you've got $5 million in your hand. I don't know. John deal. No, no deal. Why would that be a deal?
3149.60 3169.80 speaker2  And she gets up and has a briefcase and she walks toward the front door of the police What do you want to do?
3168.40 3172.80 speaker1  Are we going to bring her with us?
3171.80 3179.46 speaker4  One hour. That's fine. One hour.
3177.34 3180.46 speaker3  Is Drew, is Drew going to put up the signs for us?
3179.46 3189.82 speaker1  Yeah. Shit. That's it.
3188.82 3192.82 speaker2  We're going to go put the signs.
3191.82 3213.12 speaker1  One hour away. Damn it. She's stupid. She doesn't know how long an hour is.
3212.12 3220.76 speaker2  What?
3219.76 3224.08 speaker3  Yeah. That'll make Clark feel better.
3223.08 3227.56 speaker1  Yeah. And if we need to, we can stop here on the way back.
3226.56 3260.40 speaker3  Let's do it. I want to call Drew and tell him, Drew, forget the cat carrier. Would you come on back to the office? Don't forget the cat carrier. Perfect. Don't worry. Then let's bring that on in. When you get into the office on your desk, there's going to be a pile of flyers and a list next to it. And I want you to go and put a flyer at every place on that list. Just tape it to the door. Don't even, if somebody tries to stop you, just say the police are in control, turn on your radio and listen to the message from dog.
3258.58 3295.88 speaker4  There's like nobody here. Like there's just nobody around. Like I've been driving around. I went to the, I went to the store and there's like no shoppers. There's no cars driving around. This is crazy. I just like came in and grabbed the cat grabber. What was it that I have? Yeah. That's what I grabbed. I'm still waiting.
3294.40 3300.04 speaker3  Don't worry about putting cash down. We'll, we'll get, we'll settle up with them later.
3298.76 3304.04 speaker4  I'll just leave cash though.
3303.04 3321.66 speaker3  And don't worry.
3318.72 3329.24 speaker1  Do we need to leave Drew around if there's nobody here?
3322.66 3366.90 speaker2  You guys hear a car pull up in the parking lot of the police department and, uh, there's a knock at the door. Uh, she's an older woman with a big glasses, bigger hair. She's knocking on the door. Do I recognize her? Uh, this is Jan Manstein, Jan Manstein. She is Ari's mother. Ari is a, your co-worker, yeah, yeah, yeah. Who works in the police department and does a lot of stuff around town for you guys. And this is her mom, Jan.
3365.90 3368.90 speaker3  Hey, Jan.
3367.90 3394.38 speaker4  What's going on? Oh, hi. Yeah. Um, yeah, no, uh, I'm just here to, uh, I mean, I'm here to pick up. Maybe. I don't know, but probably I should probably get it. She'll need it.
3393.38 3406.42 speaker1  So have a seat.
3400.14 3418.62 speaker4  I, I just, I thought that, you know, uh, she would want me to, to have her, which desk
3417.62 3429.22 speaker1  What fire?
3428.22 3439.34 speaker3  What's Clark doing right now? Oh, that's a good point.
3434.78 3444.90 speaker2  confused and then you have a flood of memories with Ari.
3443.90 3455.50 speaker1  Woof.
3453.26 3476.46 speaker2  shot hotel, hotel, right, right, right, right. You sent Ari to keep an eye or Florence or Ray or Tim to keep an eye on Rosemary. That's weird. We forgot about that until just now. And Clark, do you show her where Ari's desk was and so she begins collecting the belongings of her daughter.
3475.46 3499.38 speaker3  I'm very somber. Jana, I'm, I can't tell you how sorry I am.
3492.18 3508.42 speaker4  you always think, you know, the, maybe everything will be all right, but maybe it won't, I, it's just, it's hard, but, uh, I'm sure you'll all, you'll all be there tomorrow, right?
3507.42 3515.18 speaker2  Of course.
3512.26 3526.70 speaker4  I think it's, we're doing at 11, 10 30. It's a 10 30. No, no, no, no. I decided on 11. Yeah, no, it's 11. It's all right.
3525.02 3535.10 speaker1  That's what I'm asking her.
3533.42 3540.42 speaker2  Are you going to give me the gun now?
3538.34 3577.14 speaker1  It's going directly into Marvin Glass's hands. If it goes anywhere, you can escort it with us, but I'm not giving you the gun. We clear on that. officers? No. Rosemary. Come on. No. Rosemary. Yeah. Yeah. Mobsters get hurt all the time. They put me in.
3576.14 3581.46 speaker4  They put me in handcuffs. I don't like handcuffs. Well, you shot it, please.
3580.14 3609.42 speaker1  You tried to stab Keith. He tried to fucking shoot me. Cause you were trying to stab Rosemary. 40 other people.
3608.42 3611.54 speaker4  Yeah.
3609.42 3628.62 speaker1  I didn't put that together, but she's out there right now.
3625.58 3636.34 speaker4  gonna, he's, he's gonna fall apart. I just don't know. I don't know what to tell him. I, maybe I should, maybe I shouldn't. Should I tell him? What do you think?
3635.34 3639.34 speaker1  Should I? Would you like one of us to tell him?
3638.34 3642.34 speaker4  Yes.
3641.34 3644.34 speaker2  Yes.
3643.34 3647.34 speaker4  Yes. Yeah. Yes.
3646.34 3653.14 speaker1  Please. And then real quick, remind me where he lives and his exact relation to you so there's no
3652.14 3664.58 speaker4  No.
3662.70 3670.48 speaker1  So that might be pretty convenient.
3668.06 3676.48 speaker4  No, I should be the one to tell, no, you do it. You do it. No, I should be the one. Okay. Bye.
3675.48 3692.86 speaker1  Okay. Before you go. green lights.
3691.86 3694.86 speaker4  Yeah.
3693.86 3700.56 speaker2  Animals.
3699.34 3708.38 speaker3  for you? Maybe like the last time you talked to Ari, maybe something she said then, do you remember
3707.38 3725.58 speaker4  Yeah. It was, uh, it was just the other night. What did she say? She said, uh, her last words were, I'm going to bed now. No, they were, I love you. No, it was just that she'd just eaten Mac and cheese. No, no, no. She said, I love you. And I said, I love you. I can't.
3723.86 3739.98 speaker3  We'll tell Stan that she, she said, I love you.
3738.98 3751.38 speaker4  Um, okay. I'll go. Uh, I'll see you tomorrow. It's in the city. It's at the city cemetery. She's going to be buried with her family.
3749.02 3758.42 speaker2  And she collects the things and leaves.
3757.42 3764.58 speaker1  Yeah. This is the first fucking time I've heard of Ari, but I feel like I've known her for
3763.58 3793.74 speaker3  Clark gets a chill. I just got a chill. Holy shit.
3791.74 3844.84 speaker2  keep them separated. They're all starting to combine into this strange amalgamation of this person that now you can't remember any of what their faces look like. You vaguely remember some names, some stories, but you never necessarily got close to this person, but you remember their last name was Manstein. Yeah. Losers.
3843.84 3846.84 speaker3  city. Was that the last thing we settled on?
3845.84 3910.68 speaker1  Yeah, I think so. Oh yeah. Okay. She's not letting go of that. So, uh, I take her into the back. I'm like, Hey Rosemary. Can we talk for a second real quick? Yeah. So, uh, out at your shot of the boys. You're there. Um, and I slam her against the fucking wall and put a gun on her head. She starts laughing. Okay. Well I cocked the trigger and I said, let go of the fucking briefcase and give drew You're nothing to me. You want to get your job done and live to see the end of this day and give me that fucking money. Yeah.
3902.40 3941.00 speaker2  And she drops the briefcase on to your hand and then she turns like she slowly turns. You've got it pressed against her temple. And then she just walks away back into the room without the briefcase.
3938.52 3952.72 speaker1  John lets out a huge breath. So yeah, John picks up the briefcase and I guess dashes it somewhere secure in the station because I don't want the boys to see me with it.
3950.28 3968.00 speaker2  There's got to be a like a random evidence locker. Okay.
3957.64 3973.92 speaker1  It's evidence.
3972.92 3986.36 speaker2  dog. It says the PSA is about to play.
3978.72 3990.36 speaker4  I'll do it in post but just so you guys fucking know. Okay.
3989.36 4001.36 speaker1  Wrong station. Yeah. No. We sure ain't.
4000.36 4002.36 speaker3  I'm sorry.
4001.36 4006.36 speaker0  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
4005.36 4025.28 speaker3  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
4021.48 4053.96 speaker0  It's both the dog hitting you with the weather on December 5th. Now y'all know what's been really nice outside, but prepare for a cold freeze tonight. Keep those sinks a dripping for your old buddy Wolf. And Wolf got some breaking news for y'all today. Straight from the mouth of the FBI.
4051.52 4083.88 speaker2  contention is heading this way. Please evacuate immediately. Don't forget your pets. The boys in blue are here for you. That's right. The contention PD is your BFD, which stands for best friends and dependable.
4079.04 4112.28 speaker0  Ferguson beans and Joan Robin, the mother of Ferguson's business partner were found dead in beans home early this morning. But inside sources say Joan shot Ferguson multiple times with his own firearm before turning the gun on herself.
4111.28 4117.30 speaker3  You told it. Didn't you tell us one time you're part of the bean family? Those bean boys.
4116.30 4123.34 speaker1  You haven't told us yet, right?
4119.30 4156.78 speaker2  And based on the way that we've been playing it, it's kind of this well known, it's an open secret and you guys don't bring it up because you have to work with him and he clearly fucking hates it. That's why he changed his name to avoid it. You've brought it up like once or twice and then he's ignored it and it's kind of gone And so it is an open secret. So you do know that he is related to the beans, but you've never really discussed it.
4154.78 4169.66 speaker3  So I just want to look at him. What do I see on his face?
4165.46 4178.62 speaker1  Keith, we know you're a bean. Yeah. I knew you knew. Who were they to you? That was my brother. God damn.
4177.62 4181.82 speaker3  I'm so, I'm so sorry. Keith.
4180.82 4233.58 speaker1  A long time. But yeah, that was my brother. Huh? Well, it's, we're heading to the city. We can take a look by the crime scene. I mean, maybe. Yeah. Ask the local PD what they know. Yeah. Let's do first things first though. Let's there's goo. There's goo to do. There's goo to do. If one beans died, I don't need to die from goo. We got to figure out that after, after all this. And again, just real sorry your brother got murdered, suicided. Yeah. I wish I could have, I don't know. pull over How can you know I'm the only one trying to pull over
