0	11000	Hello my hungry babies, it's your chef Wolf the dog, and I'm here to serve you up some real tasty news grub cooked up right here in contention.
11000	20000	Now don't let the local health inspector know that I cook all my grub with a microwave here at 694.2 PTBP.
20000	28000	A microwave is the only way to get that real good flavor from the rats I catch down here in the basement.
28000	43000	This week Wolf is here to reiterate to y'all that we are going to have a special presentation in a few weeks here on 694.2 PTBP, contention's newest and only radio station.
43000	53000	We're going to broadcast a recap episode with listener Q&A from a podcast called Pretending to be People.
53000	62000	If you have questions for any of the fine people on that show, act quickly, deadline is May 7th at noon Central Time y'all.
62000	74000	And send them to at PretendingPod on Twitter or Instagram, or post them on our Facebook page or the subreddit, or email them to pretendingpod at gmail dot com.
74000	82000	Or go all out, record that audio of you asking your question and send that so they can use it in the episode my babies.
82000	88000	But enough with that which is fictional, it is time for the news.
88000	102000	The officers met back at the contention police station early in the morning of December 5th along with Drew and their new partner in crime Rosemary, an actual member of the Glass crime family.
103000	116000	In the station, an FBI agent named Trent Chad was sorting through contention's paperwork, Clark shot him with a dart and agent Trent Chad became very very impressionable.
116000	128000	With agent Trent Chad's newfound pliability, the officers worked out ways in order to convince the public as well as the feds that the local authorities have everything under control in contention.
128000	132000	But of course y'all, nothing could be further from the truth.
132000	138000	The officers found the cells holding Dr. Marie Jacobs and her cat man to be empty.
138000	149000	Upon checking the security footage, they confirmed the black ooze slammed the two jailbirds into the ground of their cells before disappearing entirely.
149000	153000	Keith blurted out that the camera will be ready to use at 1pm.
154000	160000	They checked the evidence room and saw a single green light beaming from the old glass tube covered radio.
160000	163000	Seems like a pretty shitty radio to me.
163000	171000	Wolf the dog always has the green light and it's always go go go with kudzu's no backbone.
184000	197000	Luke, do you remember the time that me you and Thomas were at **** and he told our server?
197000	200000	There was a logic behind it.
200000	202000	What did you say? I don't remember.
202000	203000	I said you're fat.
203000	205000	Oh, because she was pregnant.
205000	210000	Because she was pregnant. It was an attempted twist on the thing and it didn't work.
210000	212000	Yeah, I immediately felt very weird.
212000	216000	You looked like you wanted to be anywhere else in the world.
216000	221000	I still remember the look of just like as your face fell and her face fell.
221000	223000	And I was just like, oh, fuck.
223000	225000	Oh, God, that was horrible.
225000	228000	In your defense, I can see the train of thought.
228000	230000	I can hear it coming out also.
230000	235000	It was so funny because I used to bet it didn't work.
235000	236000	Yeah, right.
236000	238000	It didn't work because I used to **** with her.
238000	239000	What's her name?
239000	241000	I don't know her name. Thank God.
241000	249000	I would come in there all the time and then I was just like, I just wanted to be like, I am so sorry.
249000	252000	What?
252000	256000	Anyway, just remembering one of my favorite moments.
256000	258000	I just don't speak in public anymore.
258000	260000	That was hilarious, dude.
260000	262000	Okay, let's play this game.
262000	263000	Let's play this game.
263000	268000	Okay, so what we're going to do is because it is, I wrote December 4th.
268000	270000	It's December 5th.
270000	272000	Baby shark.
272000	281000	So because it's a new day, I have personally forgotten many of the rules set up for this campaign when it comes to hit points and willpower.
281000	286000	So what we're going to do is we're going to roll constitution for more hit points.
286000	287000	Cool.
287000	290000	So you guys all get to roll con right now.
290000	293000	Oh, yeah, I'm way low on hit points.
294000	301000	You guys have been fucked up by a lot of different stuff, but mostly that fight with a big robot man.
301000	303000	Yeah, so I've failed.
303000	304000	Okay.
304000	305000	I passed.
305000	306000	Okay.
306000	307000	Do I have to do it for my max or for my current?
307000	308000	Current con.
308000	309000	Oh, sorry.
309000	310000	I did not do current.
310000	312000	Yeah, I got a nine, so yeah.
312000	314000	Why is your constitution different now than-
314000	315000	It's not.
315000	316000	Your con should never-
316000	317000	Oh, yeah, it doesn't change.
317000	318000	I was looking at current hit points.
318000	319000	It doesn't change.
319000	320000	Right, right.
320000	322000	But no, I got a nine on a 70, so.
322000	323000	Okay.
323000	324000	And Thomas failed.
324000	325000	Yeah.
325000	327000	Can I go to the doctor or something?
327000	329000	So John gets one hit point back.
329000	331000	Keith gets one D4.
331000	334000	So you want to roll a D4 if you pass.
334000	335000	Clark, pass or fail?
335000	336000	He passed.
336000	337000	All right.
337000	338000	So you guys both get a D4 hit points.
338000	339000	Fuck.
339000	340000	I just got one.
340000	341000	And I rolled a D4.
341000	342000	Clark gets one.
342000	344000	And Keith gets-
344000	345000	Two.
345000	347000	What's your max, Joe?
347000	349000	Max hit points is 26.
349000	351000	My current is 12.
351000	352000	Oh, word.
352000	353000	You were worse than me.
353000	354000	I'm at eight.
354000	355000	Shit.
355000	356000	I thought I was doing that at 12.
356000	357000	Now I'm at 13.
357000	358000	Yeah, because somebody fell on my face.
358000	360000	I'm the tank now.
360000	361000	Someone fell on my face.
361000	363000	Well, some idiot hadn't been lying in the road.
363000	365000	That's true.
365000	369000	You guys also all had a really rough night.
369000	376000	And when you don't get a full night's sleep, you automatically get reduced to two willpower
376000	377000	points.
377000	378000	Are you kidding me?
378000	379000	Two, two or by two?
379000	380000	To two.
380000	382000	So all of you are now at two willpower.
382000	383000	That's actually not that big a deal for me.
383000	384000	I was at five.
384000	386000	What if my current is one?
386000	387000	Do I go up to two?
387000	388000	So with you-
388000	391000	What the fuck?
391000	398000	We've been playing fast and loose with these willpower points because you're all fucking
398000	400000	addicted to cocaine now.
400000	401000	Oh, yeah.
401000	402000	Mostly, Keith.
402000	404000	But after this morning, me too.
404000	406000	So you're all at two willpower.
406000	408000	Keith, I'm going to go ahead and give you two willpower.
408000	409000	So I'm at two total.
409000	411000	So how this works is you are all-
411000	412000	Sleepy.
412000	418000	Sleepy and completely having basically an emotional breakdown, physical as well.
418000	425000	So you're all going to take a negative 20% to all roles until you either fix your willpower
425000	427000	or do an upper.
427000	430000	How long do we have to sleep to fix our willpower?
430000	431000	Full night's rest.
431000	435000	Not even a cat nap or whatever won't bump it up a few points.
436000	443000	That does make sense because when I'm feeling down and I get even an hour, I do feel better.
443000	445000	You get two or three more hours after that.
445000	446000	Cool.
446000	447000	Let's take a nap.
447000	449000	Would we still be rolling minus 20%?
449000	450000	I don't understand.
450000	451000	No.
451000	456000	So basically you roll at minus 20% on all roles when you either have one or two willpower.
456000	457000	Oh, cool.
457000	458000	Okay.
458000	460000	So if you gain any willpower, you won't be at that negative anymore.
460000	461000	Cool.
461000	462000	Okay.
462000	463000	How's that sound?
463000	465000	Are you sleeping in drugs to gain willpower back?
465000	466000	Different drugs?
466000	467000	Different drugs?
467000	468000	No.
468000	469000	Yeah.
469000	470000	I don't think so.
470000	471000	Okay.
471000	472000	Well, okay.
472000	473000	So I'm going to do some cocaine.
473000	474000	Yeah.
474000	480000	So it is 6 a.m. on December 5th and all three of you are reeling from the events of last night.
480000	485000	The dreams you cannot quite understand and the revelations of the morning.
485000	491000	You all stand in the evidence locker looking at the camera, gun, radio, and helmet all
491000	496520	with strange glass tubes making them look like they came from a weird old-timey steampunk
496520	497520	laboratory.
497520	504120	The camera, gun, and helmet each has a glowing red light giving this small room an eerie
504120	505300	tent.
505300	508800	The radio's green light is lit.
508800	514560	Keith, you feel something press against the back of your leg and then the back of your
514560	522160	thigh climbing and then you hear a meow and notice Doug, the cat previously called Salem,
522160	524800	has walked into the room and is pawing at you.
524800	525800	Oh my God.
525800	528440	This poor dude is fucking trapped in a cat's body.
528440	529440	What was it?
529440	530440	How did we communicate with him?
530440	531440	One meow for yes.
531440	532440	Two for no.
532440	533440	Yeah.
533440	534440	What should we ask him?
534440	537820	It looks like he wants to talk to Clark.
537820	538820	Was it me?
538820	539820	That was me.
539820	540820	Oh.
540820	541820	It looks like he wants to talk to Keith.
541820	542820	Hey.
542820	543820	Meow?
543820	544820	Meow.
544820	545820	I am there.
545820	546820	Hey, what?
546820	547820	Shit.
547820	548820	It's yes or no questions.
548820	549820	How you doing?
549820	550820	Meow.
550820	551820	Meow.
551820	552820	Help me out here, guys.
552820	553820	The cat jumps up onto-
553820	554820	Wait.
554820	555820	I've got to.
555820	556820	Okay.
556820	557820	Wait.
557820	558820	Not wait.
558820	559820	I mean, wait.
559820	560820	Me.
560820	561820	Stop talking, Thomas.
561820	562820	You go.
563820	564820	Shut up, Thomas.
564820	565820	Shut up, Thomas.
565820	566820	Stupid piece of shit.
566820	573820	The cat jumps up onto the shelf and immediately starts rubbing against the radio.
573820	574820	Oh, dude.
574820	575820	I'm running out of the room.
575820	576820	Clark is running out of the room.
576820	577820	Get out of there, boys.
577820	578820	You're going to switch a body.
578820	581820	Clark, when you run out, you see Agent Tramp.
581820	582820	He's like, what?
582820	583820	What's going on?
583820	584820	What's going on?
584820	585820	What's going on?
585820	586820	What's going on?
586820	587820	What's going on?
587820	588820	What's going on?
588820	589820	What's going on?
589820	590820	What's going on?
590820	591820	What's going on?
591820	600220	You see Agent Trent Chad still mopping up his Red Bull spill and Drew is sorting through
600220	606660	all these different files and Rosemary, whose name you now know, the Fonzie lady, she is
606660	611980	just standing in the middle with her arms crossed and tapping her foot.
611980	614940	I want to grab the cat by the scruff and get it away from the radio.
614940	615940	You do so.
615940	619100	Doug, are you trying to body swap with us?
619100	626700	When the cat looks at you and you're holding it, I need you to roll a dexterity real quick
626700	630300	because Doug freaks the fuck out when you grab him.
630300	631300	Oh, I pass.
631300	632300	Eight.
632300	637580	Okay, then you can describe as he is looking at you and meowing and losing it.
637580	642640	Yeah, there's just an intricate cat juggle as he tries to get away and then an arm reaches
642640	646420	out blind and just grabs him and brings him out and then the same thing happens again
646420	650660	and then finally I just press him tight to my chest and I look him dead in his little cat eyes.
650660	651660	He looks horrified.
651660	652660	What do you say?
652660	658780	I say, Doug, we're going to do everything we can to get you back to your body, but you
658780	660620	can't be trying to steal ours.
660620	664520	Maybe Chad's later, but not right now.
664520	667900	We kind of need you to just, well, actually maybe right now.
667900	668900	I don't know.
668900	674940	We could get a lot out of you, but hey guys, let's, let's do you want to swap with, yes,
674940	675940	with Chad and Doug?
676460	677460	Yeah, yeah.
677460	679460	I was thinking Rosemary, but she has knowledge that we need.
679460	680460	We need Rosemary, yeah.
680460	681460	Yeah.
681460	682460	Let's do it with FBI guy.
682460	683460	Okay.
683460	684460	All right.
684460	686460	Do you want to be in a presumably hunky FBI agent's body, Doug?
686460	689580	How are we going to do this though?
689580	691940	I don't want to be in that room when that radio goes off.
691940	698500	Doug, if we put a incapacitated Chad in that room with you, could you swap bodies using
698500	699500	that radio?
699500	700500	Meow.
700500	703060	Let's do it, boys.
703060	704060	All in favor, say aye.
704060	705060	Clark is out of the evidence.
705060	706780	Clark is out of the evidence room right now.
706780	707780	That's true.
707780	708780	Okay.
708780	709780	Let's just do it.
709780	710780	Let's just do it.
710780	711780	I'll go grab Chad.
711780	712780	Okay.
712780	713780	I walk out into...
713780	716700	Keith, is it, is it you?
716700	717700	It's me.
717700	719180	I'm not, I am me.
719180	720180	We've got a plan though.
720180	721180	Bubblegum tree.
721180	722180	I'm going to walk out too.
722180	723180	Bubblegum tree.
723180	724180	Wait.
724180	725180	Yeah.
725180	726180	So you didn't switch bodies with him?
726180	727300	No, but we got a plan.
727300	728300	Is John?
728300	729300	No, John is still John.
729300	730300	He's Bubblegum tree.
730300	731300	But here, come here.
731300	733300	I got to whisper something to you.
733300	734300	Okay.
734540	738540	We're going to switch Chad's body with Doug's body.
738540	741540	We're going to put Chad in the cat.
741540	745540	Don't, don't tell him though.
745540	746540	Okay.
746540	749260	I mean, does Doug, is Doug okay with that?
749260	750260	He meowed.
750260	751260	He meowed.
751260	752260	He meowed for yes.
752260	753260	What is?
753260	754260	Okay.
754260	757880	I really, I really liked the idea, but he, Doug doesn't know the FBI.
757880	761060	Like we have to have somebody tell the FBI not to come back here.
761060	764060	Uh, we'll just text it from his phone.
764820	765820	Yeah.
765820	766980	That's not too bad, fellas.
766980	769340	So he texts the main office, right?
769340	773700	Says, Hey, listen, I'm not, I'm heading up to the city for the afternoon to do a little
773700	775740	sightseeing and I'll be back tomorrow.
775740	779580	Cause the contention situation is locked down and we can keep them distracted for a little
779580	783340	while because we can just tell Doug what to say cause he'll have Chad's voice.
783340	784340	Oh shit.
784340	785340	Yeah.
785340	786340	We just use Doug.
786340	788840	Hey, can we fight Chad right now?
788840	789840	I don't think we need to.
789840	790840	No, no, no.
790960	797120	Do you think we could take Chad just in case Doug really goes, uh, loose cannon on us?
797120	798120	Oh, that's agent.
798120	799640	Agent Chad looks up.
799640	803160	Would you guys like to fight?
803160	809280	Maybe maybe ladder Chad, buddy, uh, ladder, maybe ladder, mama, ladder, mama, ladder,
809280	810280	big and sign.
810280	813160	Uh, maybe later, Chad, you just go close your little eyes.
813160	816000	Now you just take a little nap immediately.
816120	821920	Chad, while mopping up his red bull spill, which he's been doing for like 10 minutes
821920	825720	now, he just closes his eyes and lays down on the ground.
825720	827320	All right, let's drag him into the room.
827320	828660	He's a better cat than Doug.
828660	830560	We could just, I mean, we can drag him.
830560	831560	Sure.
831560	832560	I helped.
832560	833560	I helped the dragon.
833560	834560	I mean, we could have just asked him to walk in there with the cat.
834560	835560	Yeah.
835560	840380	But if he's, we drag him into the room with the radio as you drag him in, you notice he's
840380	847860	like squeezing his eyes closed to make sure that he like is staying consistent with your
847860	848860	hopes and dreams.
848860	849860	Yeah.
849860	850860	Hell yeah.
850860	853820	We probably just have Chad press the button then immediately Doug.
853820	859540	This cat is just like walking back and forth meowing just like Doug, we're going to leave
859540	862620	you in the room, do your thing.
862620	864340	We'll be back in a moment.
864340	865340	I'm yeah.
865340	869260	As soon as I'm like across the threshold with the body as far into the door as I can, I'm
869260	870580	stepping over it and out of the door.
870580	871580	Yep.
871580	872580	Say, Hey guys, real quick.
872580	876360	Do you think that, well, I guess it would only be beneficial to us if Doug was still
876360	880460	under the influence of the, Oh, cause it's still in his body.
880460	881460	Yeah.
881460	885460	I was going to think that could be a hindrance, but it'd actually be a great on hindrance
885460	886460	for sure.
886460	890460	We could, we could, uh, we could ask him whatever we need to about how he got that way and all
890460	891460	that stuff.
891460	892460	Yeah.
892460	893460	Okay.
893460	897220	Uh, I, you know, all the boys out, the door shuts.
897220	899140	I put my ear to the door.
899140	902220	I'm looking like under the door for like a flash of light or something.
902220	906980	Clarkie, what do you see, what do you hear?
906980	908980	What do we hear?
908980	914980	You hear some pong about as Doug enjoys his cat body.
914980	918940	One last time.
918940	919940	You hear
919940	928420	he turned on the radio boys.
928420	934660	And then you hear a click, a song start to play from inside the evidence locker of the
934660	937800	police department of contention.
937800	946780	And then you hear the song start to change and you overhear audio that does not make
946780	954460	any sense to you that gets louder until it becomes a jumble and there is a high pitched
954460	958140	noise just screeching in all of your ears.
958140	967820	As you hear a massive, massive noise and a light flashes brightly from all crevices of
967820	968820	the door.
968820	974900	And then there is silence.
974900	977300	And you hear from inside the evidence locker
977300	984980	Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh.
984980	985980	All right.
985980	988180	Oh, all right.
988180	989180	Whoa.
989180	990740	Oh shit.
990740	991740	I knock on the door.
991740	992740	Oh fuck.
992740	995740	Doug, is that you?
995740	996740	Yeah.
996740	997740	Yeah.
997740	998740	Oh man.
998740	999740	Oh man.
999740	1000740	Oh, Doug.
1000740	1009220	Why don't you get up and get on out here?
1009220	1014620	Whoa, guys, do you know what, can you open up the door?
1014620	1018820	You hear like, uh, the, the, the handle is moving and he says, can you, can you guys
1018820	1020460	open up the door for me?
1020460	1027300	I opened the door for him standing before you is the body of agent Trent Chad.
1027300	1030280	Also inside is a cat laying on the ground.
1030280	1031580	Is the cat alive?
1031580	1040420	The cat wakes up, seemingly opens its eyes, looks around, looks at itself, starts freaking
1040420	1043020	out and makes a run for the door.
1043020	1044020	Close the door.
1044020	1045020	I'm going to try to do a decks check.
1045020	1046020	Well, yeah.
1046020	1047020	Close the door.
1047020	1048020	And also who's got the best decks.
1048020	1050020	I have 60, 65, 60.
1050020	1051020	All right.
1051020	1055100	What do you, what can we do a twofer where he tries to close the door and a cat duty
1055100	1056100	cat patrol.
1056100	1057100	All right.
1057100	1058100	Uh, yeah.
1058100	1059100	Go ahead and roll first.
1059100	1063020	Keith to give, uh, to give John a plus 20.
1063020	1064380	I got a 33.
1064380	1065540	All right.
1065540	1066540	That's a Chris success.
1066540	1072280	You automatically, you guys automatically slam the door in Doug's face immediately upon
1072280	1074140	the door slamming from inside.
1074140	1077640	You hear a, Oh, is that what you guys want?
1077640	1078860	You want it?
1078860	1079860	Should I be in here?
1079860	1080860	And Oh God.
1080860	1081860	Oh no.
1081860	1082860	Oh fuck.
1082860	1102620	Why is this not a visual medium?
1102620	1104620	Your face was amazing.
1104620	1105620	Yeah.
1105620	1107620	That was awesome.
1107620	1112260	Doug subdue the cat.
1112660	1113660	I've got it.
1113660	1114660	Okay.
1114660	1121380	I'm, I'm going to go to the front door of the police department and walk it and make
1121380	1125220	sure there's no way anybody's living here until we want them to, Hey, Hey, what's going
1125220	1126220	on in there?
1126220	1128920	Hey, uh, can I get the gun now please?
1128920	1129920	In a minute.
1129920	1130920	Rosemary.
1130920	1131920	Yeah.
1131920	1132920	We're dealing with some others.
1132920	1135580	Hey drew, can you run to the store across the way?
1135580	1136580	What do you need?
1136580	1137580	We need a cat carrier.
1137580	1138580	Okay.
1138580	1140780	Um, ASAP cat carrier.
1140780	1148020	Uh, I can go pick one of those up, uh, uh, ASAP Doug, as soon as fucking possible.
1148020	1152100	Oh, drew, it's been a long night.
1152100	1153100	My dude.
1153100	1154100	Yeah.
1154100	1155100	No, no, no.
1155100	1162900	I, it's been a long night and uh, drew, uh, drew kind of looks at everyone and looks at
1162900	1168500	his keys and turns around and runs out of the police station.
1168500	1169500	Cool.
1169500	1170500	Oh.
1170500	1172860	I locked the door behind him.
1172860	1173980	Let's get Doug in here.
1173980	1178380	Where's the gun, John Rosemary, you give us one fucking minute.
1178380	1181220	We're dealing with some body switching shit here.
1181220	1182220	More crazy.
1182220	1186260	The kind of stuff your boss is interested in, but like right now you're not necessarily
1186260	1187620	our number one priority.
1187620	1189580	It's the guy who just switched bodies with the cat.
1189580	1190580	Okay.
1190580	1191860	Well, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
1191860	1192860	Well, it's related.
1192860	1196180	You're going to know more later if you just have some fucking patients and hold those
1196180	1197700	goddamn horses here.
1197700	1200940	Open the door up and let's Rosemary, you can see all this.
1200940	1201940	You're about to.
1201940	1203020	Yeah, you'll see it.
1203020	1204220	You're like a mob enforcer.
1204220	1206580	We're just letting hang out in our police station.
1206580	1219260	So could you just like chill, chill, uh, go ahead and roll, uh, persuade.
1219260	1220260	No.
1220260	1221260	Okay.
1221260	1226060	And just, uh, walked, unlocked the door of the police station and walks out.
1226060	1228900	That's probably good for us in the long run.
1228900	1230420	I mean, where's she going to go?
1230420	1231720	She doesn't have a car here.
1231720	1233340	She also doesn't have a gun.
1233340	1234340	Yeah.
1234340	1236480	Let's deal with Doug real quick.
1236480	1238060	Or should we try to stop her?
1238060	1239060	Yeah.
1239060	1240060	I don't know.
1240060	1241740	Doug, Rick, we might have to deal with something real quick.
1241740	1243260	Uh, just to double check.
1243260	1246220	Do you feel compelled to acquiesce to our desires?
1246220	1248020	Is that what you would like me to do?
1248020	1249020	Cool, cool, cool.
1249020	1250020	Hold on to that cat.
1250020	1251020	We'll be right back.
1251020	1252340	And I run out after Rosemary.
1252340	1253340	Okay.
1253340	1255300	What are the two of you doing, Clark and Keith?
1255300	1259540	I'm going to stand by inside the police department just to make sure he stays in here.
1259540	1261420	I'm back in full uniform, right?
1261420	1262420	Yeah.
1262420	1263420	I'll follow John out.
1263420	1264420	Okay.
1264420	1265420	Rosemary.
1265420	1266420	Rosemary, wait.
1266420	1275460	When you run outside, you actually see Drew is in his car and he's about to back up and
1275460	1279220	Rosemary is standing behind, banging on the trunk.
1279220	1281820	Rosemary, that's a very nice...
1281820	1283780	I pull my gun and point it at her.
1283780	1284780	All right.
1284780	1287100	Rosemary, hold on, hold on.
1287100	1291780	Get your man to open up the trunk door and then he can go get your cat carrier and I'll
1291780	1293200	come right back inside.
1293200	1294200	It's all fine.
1294200	1295200	Okay.
1295200	1296200	Everything's fine.
1296200	1299100	I'm going to come right back inside.
1299100	1300820	Just open up the trunk, Drew.
1300820	1302220	I drew all my gun too.
1302220	1303860	What's what's in the trunk, Rosemary?
1303860	1305860	I'm going to roll a...
1305860	1306860	All right.
1306860	1311540	Drew pops open the trunk and she says, thank you.
1311540	1317500	She reaches in and pulls out a briefcase, closes the door, hits the back of the trunk
1317500	1319340	and says, all right, Drew, you can go.
1319340	1321460	And then starts walking back toward you guys.
1321460	1323900	The gun lowered a little bit, but still out.
1323900	1324900	Same.
1324900	1328980	And she's just holding a metal briefcase and walking toward you.
1328980	1331180	Rosemary, what's in the briefcase there?
1331180	1333180	Five million dollars.
1333180	1334740	Interesting.
1334740	1337300	Why?
1337300	1338540	It's not yours.
1338540	1339540	Is it yours?
1339540	1340540	It is now.
1340540	1343860	Want to go have these?
1343860	1344860	No, thank you.
1344860	1350260	And she walks past you and heads to the door of the police station.
1350260	1353940	I turned to John, do you have any idea what the...
1353940	1355820	I've got no fucking clue what's going on.
1355820	1357580	Five million is?
1357580	1359700	She opens up the door and walks into the police station.
1359700	1362580	I guess she's back where we wanted her.
1362580	1368700	I assume so, though much wealthier than all of us, which I think means she's our boss
1368740	1373140	by American rules.
1373140	1374420	Is she our new chief?
1374420	1379060	There's only one rule here in America.
1379060	1382380	The almighty dollar.
1382380	1385580	Whoever has the most money is the chief of police.
1385580	1389260	Yeah, that's kind of how it works.
1389260	1393860	Dude, if either one of us win the Mega Millions tonight, we're going to have the best podcast
1393860	1397900	of all time.
1398100	1400100	Welcome to Pretend to Be People.
1400100	1401980	Oh man, we can finally get that.
1401980	1403820	We can buy the Nat soundboard.
1403820	1406620	That Thomas soundboard we've all been wanting.
1406620	1407620	We can hire...
1407620	1408620	Nice.
1408620	1409620	Nice.
1409620	1410620	No, no, no, no, no.
1410620	1411620	Nice.
1411620	1414820	We just have professional voice actors that we dictate everything we speak of.
1414820	1419100	I mean, yeah, that's the plan for this actual podcast, right?
1419100	1420340	That's where we're headed.
1420340	1421340	Yeah, this is...
1421340	1422820	What we've been doing is a rough draft.
1422820	1423820	It's a rough script.
1423820	1425540	Yeah, we're going to have...
1425540	1427340	It's the pilot season.
1427780	1433420	Sam Rockwell and Jake as Keith Vigna on a podcast for whatever reason.
1433420	1436780	Idris Elba is playing Maggie Cook.
1436780	1437780	Nice.
1437780	1439620	Makes lots of sense.
1439620	1441260	Clark goes back inside.
1441260	1443300	John also goes back inside.
1443300	1449340	I see them come back inside and I open up the door and I let Doug in to the main room.
1449340	1456420	He kind of throws the cat back into the evidence room as you shut the door and he walks out
1456420	1462500	and he looks at his hands and he's like, wow, everything is very weird.
1462500	1465860	Doug, do you remember who you are?
1465860	1477780	Yeah, I remember that and then he looks past you and his eyes widen and he says, oh my
1477780	1479860	God, oh my God.
1479860	1484580	And he starts freaking out and he backs up back against the wall and then he just starts
1484580	1488620	moving and just dodging and trying to run away.
1488620	1489620	There's the ooze.
1489620	1490620	Get it back.
1490620	1491620	The ooze is here, guys.
1491620	1492620	The fucking ooze.
1492620	1493620	Water, water, water.
1493620	1500140	I run into the sink that's in the police department.
1500140	1502300	You run into the sink.
1502300	1503300	Is it there?
1503300	1504300	You actually bump into it.
1504300	1509200	I grab the biggest container I can find, probably a bowl, but if not a cup, fill it with water
1509200	1513140	and I'm throwing it over my shoulders close to Doug as I can.
1513140	1520340	I go to the other sink and I just smash the faucet off so water is spraying everywhere.
1520340	1522780	I asked, Doug, can you see the ooze right now?
1522780	1524660	Yes, it's right there.
1524660	1525660	It's right there.
1525660	1526660	Don't let it touch you.
1526660	1527660	Don't let it touch you.
1527660	1528660	Where's he pointing to?
1528660	1531500	He's just pointing on the ground in the middle of the room.
1531500	1535340	So is water spraying, is water spraying everywhere?
1535340	1536340	Are we getting close?
1536340	1537340	Am I hitting it with water?
1537340	1538340	Am I?
1538340	1539340	Uh, I'm sorry.
1539340	1540340	Cause there's no way I would know.
1540340	1541860	Am I hitting them where he's pointing with water?
1541860	1546340	So in your mind, where is the sink in the police station?
1546340	1551340	I was picturing in my head just now like a firehouse kitchen to where it's like just
1551340	1553580	the, the side of the half of a room.
1553580	1554580	Sure.
1554580	1555580	Yeah.
1555580	1556580	Like that's kind of what I was like.
1556580	1557580	No real separation.
1557580	1558580	Yeah.
1558580	1559580	Just like a break room.
1559580	1560580	Microwave sink.
1560580	1561580	Right.
1561580	1562580	Toaster.
1562580	1563580	You know what I can picture?
1563580	1564580	That.
1564580	1565580	Cool.
1565580	1566580	So I smashed a bathroom.
1566580	1567580	I smashed a bathroom fixture.
1568060	1570860	Open the cabinet doors up and break the pipe off.
1570860	1571860	Yeah.
1571860	1579200	So you've got water flowing out from that side of the very open floor plan of the contention
1579200	1581180	police department.
1581180	1587860	Doug is still freaking out and sprinting about and Drew does not know or Drew's not there.
1587860	1590940	Rosemary has absolutely no idea what's going on.
1590940	1596980	She has walked over to Drew's desk and is like sitting up on top of the desk, just Indian
1596980	1598700	style holding the briefcase.
1598700	1600180	It's called crisscross applesauce now.
1600180	1602180	I am so sorry.
1602180	1604180	Sitting crisscross applesauce.
1604180	1605180	Fuck.
1605180	1608180	We got him.
1608180	1609740	Boom.
1609740	1614220	I guess I run over to where the water's flowing out and stand there just to be safe.
1614220	1615220	Yeah.
1615220	1616220	Doug get, get to the water.
1616220	1619100	He runs over and joins you and stays calm.
1619100	1622780	Doug, how big is the Zeus?
1622780	1627920	And his eyes get bigger than they were even a second ago.
1627920	1634060	The water is not stopping it.
1634060	1640580	And he sprints around the outside of the room and heads for the front door of the police
1640580	1641580	station.
1641580	1646220	Doug, if you head outside, please just remain right there and wait for further instruction.
1646220	1647900	I think I run after him.
1647900	1648900	I think I do too.
1648900	1649900	Like out of scare.
1649900	1650900	Yeah.
1650900	1654820	I'm going to try to find a vacuum, like a little dust devil, like handheld.
1654820	1655820	Okay.
1655820	1661500	So you're going to try to find your little vacuum and Keith and Clark are running after
1661500	1662500	Doug.
1662500	1668620	I abandoned my fireman's bucket line of water over my shoulder and yeah, it's hightailing
1668620	1669620	it.
1669620	1670620	Following the same path that he took.
1670620	1671620	Same.
1671620	1672620	Yeah.
1672620	1673620	Following the same path.
1673620	1679580	As you get to the front door, you see him standing in the parking lot and I need whoever
1679580	1683140	has the worst luck to roll luck right now for me.
1683140	1685140	What do you guys have?
1685140	1686140	75.
1686140	1687140	45.
1687140	1688140	65.
1688140	1689140	They're the ones outside though.
1689140	1690140	Did you mean of all of us?
1690140	1691140	I said what I meant.
1691140	1692140	I know what you meant.
1692140	1694740	I didn't hear you say oh.
1694740	1695740	I pass.
1695740	1696740	Crit pass.
1696740	1697740	Motherfucker.
1697740	1698740	33.
1698740	1699740	33 baby.
1699740	1700740	That's two 33s tonight.
1700740	1701740	Yeah, that is.
1701740	1704260	I hope that's on my mega millions ticket.
1704260	1712020	Clark, Keith, you run out the front door of the police station and see Doug standing in
1712020	1715220	the middle of the parking lot of the police and contention.
1715220	1716220	The fuck.
1716220	1725460	You see him standing in the middle of the parking lot and he is on his hands and knees
1725460	1727420	and he is weeping.
1727420	1729700	I yell at Doug.
1729700	1730980	You still see it.
1730980	1732660	Doug, come on buddy.
1732660	1733660	Come on.
1733660	1736100	I don't know what I see.
1736100	1738100	I don't see anything.
1738100	1745380	I go up to him and I slap him in the face and I say snap out of it, man.
1745380	1746580	Doug, we can't see it.
1746580	1748380	We need you to tell us if it's here.
1748380	1749380	I can't.
1749380	1751940	I can't see anything.
1751940	1754660	I don't know what's going on anymore.
1754660	1756660	It's just real.
1757660	1765780	And he just throws up onto the parking lot and he's now, I mean, completely bent over.
1765780	1768620	Snot is just pouring out of his nose.
1768620	1773060	He's like kind of spitting on the ground and he's like, I just don't know.
1773060	1776100	Is Keith's car in the lot with us?
1776100	1777100	The Cruiser is indeed.
1777100	1778100	Yes.
1778100	1779100	Okay.
1779100	1781380	Hey Keith, let's get him up into your car, man.
1781380	1785020	I put an arm under his arm.
1785020	1786020	I'll take the other?
1786900	1787900	Let's put him in the back.
1787900	1793740	I'm trying to give reassuring words, but I'm also, Clark needs him to shape up.
1793740	1796900	I want to know for sure what he sees.
1796900	1802900	I cast zone of truth.
1802900	1805540	Mage Hand.
1805540	1807620	He's weeping as you get him to the police cruiser.
1807620	1809500	I would like to persuade him not to weep.
1809500	1810500	I'm kidding.
1810500	1811500	I'm not even in.
1811500	1813580	Let's cut back to John in the police department.
1813580	1814580	You find a vacuum.
1814580	1815580	What are you doing with it?
1815660	1820940	Well, so not being able to see anything, I'm just like dancing from side to side, like
1820940	1826700	jumping back and forth and just like stabbing out in the air with this little dust devil.
1826700	1831700	What do you think, music wise, what's set to this?
1831700	1832940	I think it's totally silent.
1832940	1843180	I think you just hear his foot falls in wet wet squeaky feet and like Rosemary faintly
1843180	1850780	chuckling shut up, Rosemary, John, you look stupid.
1850780	1851780	Damn it.
1851780	1858540	I know cutting back, you get him into the police cruiser and he immediately just folds
1858540	1861380	a head into hands and he's breaking down.
1861380	1865260	When he looks at you guys, you see a ghost of a man.
1865260	1872660	I want to say, Hey, Hey, Hey Doug, will you, will you wipe your brow with your right hand?
1873140	1874140	He does so.
1874140	1875140	Okay.
1875140	1877460	I wanted to make sure he was still under the influence.
1877460	1878460	Okay.
1878460	1880500	That's, this is all understandable.
1880500	1884300	He's a man who became a cat who became a different man.
1884300	1886620	Very hard to process.
1886620	1898620	I uh, he starts coughing.
1898620	1899880	I start petting him on the back.
1899880	1900880	Get it out bud.
1900880	1901880	Get it out.
1903660	1907940	And no fur comes up cause he's in a human body now that didn't eat any hair.
1907940	1913060	Uh, but he just throws up a little bile onto the floor of the police cruiser.
1913060	1914060	Old habits die hard.
1914060	1917660	I know, but how long were you in that body?
1917660	1918660	I don't know.
1918660	1922980	Time, time isn't, isn't real.
1922980	1925260	And I was so cold.
1925260	1930460	Hey, if it makes you feel any better, we don't have any idea where your wife is.
1930460	1942260	Just kidding.
1942260	1943260	That's not true.
1943260	1946980	I think we have a pretty good idea where she is.
1946980	1949400	The upside down.
1949400	1951100	He looks up at you guys.
1951100	1952460	What's happening?
1952460	1954160	Why is this happening?
1954160	1959620	Do you remember anything before you change, changed bodies with that cat?
1959620	1962540	Yeah, I, what led up to that happening?
1962540	1975360	I was, uh, I was sick and uh, Marie was, uh, taking care of me and she brought, she brought
1975360	1985340	in this radio is that radio, that fucking radio and she turned it on and I, I don't
1985340	1986340	know.
1986340	1987340	Then it's just flashes.
1987340	1988460	I was cold.
1988460	1989460	I was in the water.
1990300	1992180	I mean, I was running away from this.
1992180	1993340	It felt like a dream.
1993340	1999940	I think I was dreaming and then he, uh, he looks up and he, he catches a glimpse of himself
1999940	2005860	in the rear view mirror of the cruiser and he's like, this is a dream.
2005860	2006980	This is a dream.
2006980	2007980	This is a dream.
2007980	2008980	This is a dream.
2008980	2009980	I'm going to dream.
2009980	2010980	You're in a dream.
2010980	2014040	You're in my dream and uh, we're all in this dream and it's fine.
2014040	2015040	Everything's fine.
2015040	2016580	I'm just going to wake up and everything's going to be fine.
2016580	2017580	You're fine.
2017580	2018580	It's fine.
2018580	2019580	Everything's going to be fine.
2019580	2020580	You're not dreaming, Doug.
2020580	2021580	I look at Keith.
2021580	2022580	I mean, sure.
2022580	2024460	Hey Doug, you're right.
2024460	2030860	This is, this is just a crazy dream and as soon as it's run its course, you'll wake up
2030860	2034540	next to Marie and everything's going to be all right.
2034540	2038700	But for now, why not give us as much help as you can?
2038700	2039700	What's the worst that could happen?
2039700	2040700	It's just a dream.
2040700	2041700	No Dougie, no cry.
2041700	2042700	All right.
2042700	2043700	What do we do?
2044420	2045420	What do we do?
2045420	2048700	Well, I got, I got, I got a question for you, Doug.
2048700	2052300	When we, when you were in that cat body, you seemed real confident when we asked you if
2052300	2056020	you knew how to use the radio to switch bodies back.
2056020	2058660	How did you know how to do it so well?
2058660	2059980	She just turned it on.
2059980	2064300	So you, you, is there a chance we, you could have switched bodies with any of us as far
2064300	2068460	as you know, or did you know that you were going to go into the detective's body somehow?
2068460	2069460	The detective?
2069460	2070460	I'm sorry.
2070460	2071740	Uh, the body that you're in right now.
2071780	2077700	I just knew that I, there was a great chance that I wasn't going to be a cat anymore.
2077700	2078700	Okay.
2078700	2083540	So you didn't like think real hard about wanting to be that body on the floor or anything
2083540	2084540	like that?
2084540	2088980	No, I was just thinking about being, I mean, when I was in there, sure.
2088980	2095220	I was just thinking like, be a human, be a human, be a human, but like, you know, like,
2095220	2096460	what's that even mean?
2096460	2097460	You know?
2097460	2098460	Sure.
2098940	2100740	It's a dream.
2100740	2110860	Doesn't have to make any sense over his head at Keith and roll my eyes.
2110860	2116220	Cutting back to in the police department, John, you're, you're vacuuming around and
2116220	2120820	just like sprinting all over the place, leaping from side to side.
2120820	2127300	As you do, you see there is a briefcase that is like a leather briefcase that you haven't
2127340	2131140	seen before ever in the police department.
2131140	2138060	And it has a little plaque on it, placard that just says, uh, agent Chad on it.
2138060	2142480	And as you're going about your business, uh, you notice that on one of the desks.
2142480	2147020	So I'm going to stop in my tracks for just a moment.
2147020	2151020	Does a goo monster eat me roll now?
2151020	2152020	You're good.
2152020	2153020	Okay.
2153020	2155580	I take a breath.
2155580	2159620	I'm standing there for maybe like 15, 20 seconds.
2159620	2163260	And then I go over to the, once I'm sure the coast is clear, I go over to the case.
2163260	2165940	Uh, why'd you stop dancing?
2165940	2170100	I think that might've been some kind of illusory goo monster, but I'm not really sure.
2170100	2171460	Oh yeah, totally.
2171460	2176300	We're dealing with a man who had his brain transferred into a cat.
2176300	2177300	Yeah, that all adds up.
2177300	2178300	More like his consciousness.
2178300	2179300	Sure.
2179300	2181020	You're such a dick, Rosemary.
2181020	2184500	Well, you're a fucking idiot and you're talking nonsense.
2185500	2191020	Smarter than you says under his breath.
2191020	2192780	That is actually true for the listeners.
2192780	2198260	Uh, John has a 75 intelligence and Rosemary has a 45.
2198260	2202140	I'm way smarter than you.
2202140	2205380	So I go over to the case and see if I can, is it locked or anything?
2205380	2206760	No, it's not locked.
2206760	2208740	What has Chad been up to?
2208740	2212740	When you open it, you notice there are a lot of things inside this briefcase.
2212980	2215340	There's a lot of things inside this briefcase.
2215340	2216340	Four specifically.
2216340	2219660	Well, I mean, several.
2219660	2222220	But the first thing is a bunch of signs.
2222220	2224420	Rosemary, I think it's a sign.
2224420	2226940	It's a bunch of these signs.
2226940	2235620	There is also a list that is right here and there is also a map that is right here and
2235620	2241580	there's also a little device in there that you would recognize as a cell phone jammer
2241580	2243540	and it is turned on.
2243540	2244540	It's strawberry.
2244540	2246900	Cutting back into the parking lot.
2246900	2249660	Oh shit, Keith, John.
2249660	2254060	Oh, Doug, we need you to come tell us if you see any of that goo.
2254060	2256780	I don't know.
2256780	2260340	You know, honestly, I'm pretty sure I was just seeing that stuff.
2260340	2263820	Well, why don't you just come in with us and just double check.
2263820	2264820	Okay.
2264820	2269020	And so he gets out and he's, you know, he's still trying to get it together.
2269020	2271420	He's crying a bit.
2271420	2273980	He's crying a bit, but you guys get him in.
2273980	2275180	What do you see, Doug?
2275180	2276180	Looks around.
2276180	2278180	It must be gone now.
2278180	2279780	No goo.
2279780	2281660	Got a wet floor though, seemingly.
2281660	2285820	And then he kind of walks over to where you guys just were in the mirror above the sink
2285820	2290620	and he just stares in it and he starts feeling his face.
2290620	2292660	I walk over to John.
2292660	2294260	What you looking at there?
2294260	2295260	Hey guys.
2295300	2300260	So, Agent Chad had some weird stuff in his briefcase.
2300260	2303220	You should probably take a look at this.
2303220	2307740	I was just going to say we might be careful though in case he had some like, since the
2307740	2313120	animals seem to have been able to see the goo and maybe he just had some residuals from
2313120	2315380	being a cat, that goo might still be in here.
2315380	2317780	Hey Doug, you think the goo is still in here?
2317780	2324180	I don't, honestly, I just, um, I don't know what you're talking about.
2325180	2328300	You think the scary thing, the thing that scared you?
2328300	2334820	Yeah, I, you know, I've been through a lot and I just, um, you know, I think I just freaked
2334820	2341580	out but everything seems to be fine, uh, now, you know, I don't, I think my head is clear.
2341580	2346860	It's, uh, I don't know if you were aware of this, but you're in my dream right now, where
2346860	2351500	I'm another person, which is nuts, uh, so, you know.
2351500	2353660	That seems like pretty standard dream stuff for me.
2353660	2358380	No, I don't think I've ever had a dream where I wasn't myself, but, uh, here is a little
2358380	2363740	dust devil in case you get the wheelies again and then you can scoop, you can scoop it up.
2363740	2365900	You can scoop up the, with the dust devil?
2365900	2366900	Yeah.
2366900	2367900	Yeah.
2367900	2368900	All right.
2368900	2369900	And then he grabs it.
2369900	2370900	All right.
2370900	2371900	He just kind of rubs it, keeps looking in the mirror.
2371900	2377740	He's, he's really, you know, as one might be when in a different body, he is fascinated
2377740	2378740	by his reflection.
2378740	2379740	Sure.
2379740	2380740	Yeah.
2380820	2385900	As you guys probably saw, Chad had this, these signs to put up all over town, uh, saying
2385900	2389660	attention a chemical spill from the unincorporated land.
2389660	2396100	Once the town perdition just west of contention is heading this way, please evacuate immediately.
2396100	2397580	Don't forget your pets.
2397580	2401140	There's this list of all the places he was going to post the signage at.
2401140	2404420	It's all, it's all the main hotspots in town here.
2404420	2408780	You talk, talk about that one for an equal opportunity podcast.
2408780	2410740	Everybody gets to read a little something.
2410740	2414180	Uh, yeah, he's also, uh, got this map here.
2414180	2418900	It's it's color coded showing all the missing persons and the days that they all left.
2418900	2422020	And it would have been nice to have had drew tell us about that.
2422020	2424240	It would have been, he had a lot on his mind.
2424240	2428220	It's over the dates of December 1st, December 2nd and December 3rd.
2428220	2432700	There's a couple of dots on December 1st, three on the second and then an explosion
2432700	2433700	on the third.
2433700	2434700	That's correct.
2434700	2435700	Dots all over the town.
2435700	2436700	Okay.
2436700	2437700	Yeah.
2437700	2440580	So if you get a chance to study that list, is there anything out of the ordinary?
2440580	2444180	That list is just a list of the places that exist in contention.
2444180	2445180	Okay.
2445180	2446180	Okay.
2446180	2447180	Yeah.
2447180	2448980	I don't think there's anything further to examine in that list.
2448980	2453580	Rosemary says, well, didn't he, uh, didn't he get there this morning before any place
2453580	2454580	opened?
2454580	2456740	Probably didn't have a chance yet to go to any of them.
2456740	2460900	That's why there's so many posters in the whatever you guys are.
2460900	2461900	Yeah.
2461900	2465740	I mean, what are you Rosemary?
2465740	2466740	Rosemary.
2466780	2469020	Clearly he hadn't put the signs up yet.
2469020	2472580	I don't know what you're trying to tell us yet.
2472580	2474980	He didn't put the signs up yet.
2474980	2477260	That's why they're in the briefcase.
2477260	2481820	And it looks like there's a little squares for him to make a check mark where he went
2481820	2482820	and there are no checkmarks.
2482820	2483820	I'm sorry.
2483820	2484820	I cut you off.
2484820	2485820	I said what I needed to say.
2485820	2489900	Rosemary, do you think you're telling us something new?
2489900	2491180	We all got that pretty quick.
2491180	2492180	Yeah.
2492180	2494460	It's just been a while since I talked to him.
2494460	2497580	I just want to remind you that my intelligence is 45.
2497580	2499380	All right.
2499380	2504940	What a weird way to quantify your own intelligence, but, uh, out of 50 in my mom's eyes.
2504940	2505940	Yeah.
2505940	2507340	Mama's love us all.
2507340	2508340	What do we do now guys?
2508340	2514500	Well, I would still like to talk to the, uh, the big guy in the city with Rosemary here.
2514500	2516020	Well, what should we do with Doug?
2516020	2517980	Well, Doug is a very useful tool.
2517980	2518980	Yeah.
2518980	2521580	We want him to stick with us for as long as possible at this point.
2521580	2523940	Also seems like we could probably get more information out of them.
2523940	2528060	Well, I think if you want to go by yourself, you want to come with, I mean, you are going
2528060	2534360	to go talk to a mob boss, so maybe it's not the safest for one police officer to go kind
2534360	2538300	of seems safer than being in a town with a goo monster, but Clark or Clark.
2538300	2539300	Hey Clark.
2539300	2540300	Yes.
2540300	2541300	Joe.
2541300	2547980	Oh, it's fun to watch someone break mentally in person.
2547980	2552980	Hey John, can you remind me why did the, the Bob want the gun?
2553020	2562860	All right, so John Peters owed money, gambling debts, we assume to the mob, uh, to the glass
2562860	2564780	crime family.
2564780	2569620	He sent his two boys down there, Marvin glass, sent his two boys to go collect that money
2569620	2577580	after Peters had already come in to possession of the artifacts and some magic fuckery happened.
2577580	2581420	One of the boys disappeared, Jermaine Jermaine.
2581460	2586580	The other one is a babbling idiot just talking about that gun now, Alfred, gun boy.
2586580	2590740	So that's really all Rosemary knows is that she's supposed to come down here and get this
2590740	2595180	gun gun and take it back to, uh, the Marvin glass boss.
2595180	2596180	Yeah.
2596180	2599980	And after we got to talking, I was thinking that, you know, perhaps we could recruit this
2599980	2606620	Marvin glass and his army of games to help us out down here in exchange for maybe getting
2606620	2610540	his boy back from the upside down.
2610540	2616500	So you're hoping that this gun means that much to him, but that's your big, that's your
2616500	2617500	bargaining chip, right?
2617500	2622180	I'm hoping, well, I'm hoping his bullet means that much to him, but yeah, the gun is the
2622180	2623660	bridge to the boy.
2623660	2626260	I pulled John far away from Rosemary.
2626260	2628000	I mean, that's what we're bluffing, right?
2628000	2630020	We don't know where the gun works.
2630020	2634780	I don't know fucking shit about how the gun works, but we fucking like, that's kind of
2634780	2637260	my whole pitch to Mr. Glass.
2637260	2641380	It's like, Hey man, there's some weird supernatural shit happening.
2641380	2646940	And uh, if you want your boy back, we could really use any operational assistance your
2646940	2654080	organization could provide that comes without the pesky oversight of say the FBI.
2654080	2657860	So I thought maybe he could pitch in and would have a strong motivation to do so.
2657860	2659420	I E it's child.
2659420	2660420	Yeah.
2660420	2661420	I don't know.
2661420	2666020	It sounds risky, but if you think you can do it, the manpower would be helpful.
2666060	2667060	Yeah.
2667060	2671860	And just, you know, more minds on this thing, crime boys thinking crime ways, it's a criminal
2671860	2672860	goo.
2672860	2674100	It's already taken so many people.
2674100	2681860	So it's a criminal goo.
2681860	2682860	Yeah.
2682860	2683860	Okay.
2683860	2691420	Well, so one thing I think we should definitely do is, is there any truth to this?
2691420	2693260	Was this talk of the chemical spill?
2693260	2694760	That's probably just a cover up.
2694760	2697000	Is it a cover up or is there some truth to it?
2697000	2698000	Yeah.
2698000	2699000	Something happened in Perdition.
2699000	2702640	That could be that they think that there's something moving this way either way.
2702640	2703640	Exactly.
2703640	2707280	I also think maybe it's not a bad idea to just go ahead and post those around town to
2707280	2708640	save more people.
2708640	2709640	I'm with you.
2709640	2710640	Yeah.
2710640	2712000	Uh, but maybe we go check out Perdition.
2712000	2714840	Also get some of these protesters out of our hair.
2714840	2716000	Yeah, for sure.
2716000	2722480	Do we, do we need to edit our radio message to adhere to the attention signs that we've
2722480	2723640	just now gotten?
2723640	2724640	That would not be a bad idea.
2724640	2726520	We could have Doug do that right now.
2726520	2727520	Hopefully.
2727520	2728520	Yeah.
2728520	2729520	Hey Doug.
2729520	2730520	Yeah.
2730520	2731520	Come over here for a second.
2731520	2732520	Sure.
2732520	2734520	Can you, uh, here, let me, let me just write it down and I write down exactly what I want
2734520	2735520	him to say.
2735520	2736520	Okay.
2736520	2740240	Would you mind reading this into this recorder here for us and just, just read it as naturally
2740240	2741240	as you can.
2741240	2742240	But hit me with it.
2742240	2743240	I don't know what it's going to say.
2743240	2748320	It says, attention, a chemical spill from the unincorporated land once the town Perdition
2748320	2751840	just west of contention is heading this way, please evacuate immediately.
2751840	2753120	Do not forget your bets.
2753120	2754120	Okay.
2754120	2755880	Let me give that a go.
2755880	2759600	And the contention PD are on your side.
2759600	2760600	Once again.
2760600	2761600	Yeah.
2761600	2771020	Uh, tension, a chemical spill from the unincorporated land once the town Perdition just west of
2771020	2776560	contention is heading this way, please evacuate immediately.
2776560	2778480	Don't forget your pets.
2778480	2779760	And say the boys in blue are here for you.
2779760	2783200	The boys in blue are here for you.
2783200	2784200	That's right.
2784200	2793920	The contention PD is your B F D, which stands for best friends and dependable.
2793920	2796840	You know, Doug, you, you went a little off script at the end, but you really got the
2796840	2800520	message across and I think that was, it was good at lip and it's great how much you sound
2800520	2801520	like Chad.
2801520	2802520	That's awesome.
2802520	2803520	Thank you.
2803520	2808200	Voices come from the body, not the person.
2808200	2813120	I didn't think you were, it doesn't make sense to me either.
2813120	2814120	This does make sense.
2814120	2815120	Yeah.
2815120	2821320	It's just very convenient that we can still have Chad's body as well.
2821320	2825920	Uh, okay.
2825920	2831380	So a couple, I was going to say a couple of things are going to happen.
2831380	2836560	That's not our podcast.
2836560	2847120	There are other role playing podcasts.
2847120	2848620	Have you met anyone?
2848620	2852160	They also have a role playing podcast.
2852160	2853160	I hate everyone.
2853160	2854160	Yeah.
2854160	2855160	Okay.
2855160	2863120	So you have Doug record that message and pretty immediately you see Rosemary is getting a
2863120	2872260	pretty tired of this shit and she's a stood up now, John gun now, or I'm going to go find
2872260	2873260	your briefcase.
2873260	2878140	I don't know what that means, but well, listen, let me talk with the boys for just a second
2878140	2880780	and I think we're going to move things towards getting you that gun.
2880780	2883140	Can you hold on real quick while I confer five minutes?
2883140	2884140	All right.
2884140	2886140	Oh, I thought she was going to start counting.
2886140	2887140	Yeah, me too.
2887140	2889020	That would not have been enough for minutes.
2889020	2891060	Oh, you don't know what a minute is.
2891060	2892060	You're real dumb.
2892060	2893060	Three minutes.
2893060	2894140	Oh no.
2894140	2898160	Why did Marvin glass and trust you with this last few minutes?
2898160	2900640	Let's go start back at 60 then you're good.
2900640	2902360	All right boys.
2902360	2906080	John Stossel.
2906080	2908360	I'm not aware of the reference.
2908360	2911720	He's on 60 minutes.
2911720	2917480	Good one Rosemary.
2917480	2918480	Now I get it.
2918480	2919480	Yeah.
2919480	2920480	Yeah.
2920900	2924300	Boys, she's getting pretty antsy about this gun and getting back to the city.
2924300	2926740	I don't know that we have any other leads other than this.
2926740	2930740	Well, we've got unincorporated land in perdition, but that might be a pretty dangerous place
2930740	2931740	to go to.
2931740	2935340	Also, it could just be a thing that the FBI said.
2935340	2939920	Would we know, would you be able to swing by the unincorporated land quite easily on
2939920	2942020	your way to the city from contention?
2942020	2944180	Couldn't be more in the opposite direction.
2944180	2946260	Guys, that couldn't be more in the opposite direction.
2946260	2948020	I mean, contingent is not that big.
2948020	2950600	That's not going to add more than an hour or so, I don't think.
2950600	2953240	That well, yeah, but I mean, I think Tom is of the essence.
2953240	2956240	What is she going to do if we like, we'll get there eventually.
2956240	2957960	She's not going to like kill us.
2957960	2960920	And if she does, she'll only kill one of us.
2960920	2961920	You can't hear this Rosemary.
2961920	2962920	We're talking.
2962920	2963920	Out of your shot.
2963920	2965160	She just overheard laughter.
2965160	2969060	She's on Instagram.
2969060	2970840	She just follows shit posters.
2970840	2971920	She's watching puppy cuts.
2971920	2972920	Yeah.
2972920	2973920	What do you think?
2973920	2974920	Well, I'd like to go.
2975180	2979380	You boys don't have to come with me, but, uh, it might be more convenient for recording
2979380	2980380	purposes.
2980380	2981380	Yeah.
2981380	2982380	Yeah.
2982380	2983620	Uh, Joe's at a pickle there.
2983620	2985300	I don't think Clark would go at all.
2985300	2988940	He'd be afraid of the mob and feel like we have to take care of shit here, but I also
2988940	2991100	don't want to be away from them for a long time.
2991100	2995100	It could be if you guys go to the city and all that shit.
2995100	2996100	I don't know.
2996100	3001520	Hey John, how about can we, can we, can we ask Rosemary to give us the morning to put
3001520	3007120	up these signs and get in touch with dog and get the radio broadcast out and then maybe
3007120	3009620	we could run up there and run up to city.
3009620	3014900	We can leave Ray in charge for, she's testy, but I don't know if she has a real strong
3014900	3016980	bargaining position here.
3016980	3017980	Right.
3017980	3020900	Cause it's three men in this office with guns.
3020900	3023780	So and we have the one thing that she wants.
3023780	3025300	Yeah, that's exactly right.
3025300	3030300	And we can stop by here first or no, maybe we'll decide on the way.
3030320	3032720	We could always just have Drew do the signs.
3032720	3033720	Oh fuck.
3033720	3034720	Joe didn't think of that.
3034720	3036880	Clark probably would have cause that's a very good idea.
3036880	3038520	There's no reason that we need to do that personally.
3038520	3039520	Grunt work.
3039520	3040520	Who has the best alertness?
3040520	3041520	Got a 70.
3041520	3046400	Do you want to roll alertness Clark?
3046400	3053720	I helipass a three on a, it would be a 50 since a minus 20% but yeah, three.
3053720	3055320	Which we forgot about all podcasts.
3055320	3057080	I don't think anybody's rolled.
3057080	3058080	What did we forget?
3058080	3059080	Sorry.
3059080	3060080	The minus 20.
3060860	3061860	But you guys crit.
3061860	3062860	Yeah.
3062860	3063860	Succeeded.
3063860	3064860	So that's true.
3064860	3065860	Oh man.
3065860	3068100	I need to be a better handler.
3068100	3071860	Also my, like it wouldn't have affected, I think I've done two roles because it rolled
3071860	3073900	like super low on all your roles.
3073900	3074900	Okay.
3074900	3075900	That makes me feel better.
3075900	3081580	So you pass, you notice very clearly Rosemary is listening in on the conversation.
3081580	3084700	Hey, get out of here.
3084700	3086700	Get on out.
3086700	3089500	Cause she's just still sitting where she is, right?
3089500	3090880	She didn't walk over to us.
3090880	3097320	If you are in the same room still, yeah, no, she's just intently listening to your conversation.
3097320	3098920	I just pulled John in a little closer.
3098920	3100960	I think she can hear us.
3100960	3103800	It's not ideal, but she's also not the brightest bulb.
3103800	3107200	Rosemary, did you hear any of that?
3107200	3108200	No.
3108200	3109200	All right.
3109200	3114200	She heard.
3114200	3115320	Did you like any of it?
3115320	3116320	Yeah.
3116320	3118800	Rosemary, we need an hour in contention before we can leave.
3118800	3121340	Is that all right?
3121340	3125260	Keep in mind we all have pistols and the one thing you want in the world and the one thing
3125260	3127340	your boss wants in the world.
3127340	3129020	Your boss is a pretty scary dude.
3129020	3132700	So consider this hour your entire fucking life.
3132700	3140020	Like I'll give you an hour for a hundred thousand dollars.
3140020	3141020	We'll get it to you later.
3141020	3142020	Yeah.
3142020	3143780	I mean you've got $5 million in your hand.
3143780	3144780	I don't know.
3144780	3145780	John deal.
3145780	3147260	No, no deal.
3147260	3148600	Why would that be a deal?
3148600	3149600	Okay.
3149600	3154800	And she gets up and has a briefcase and she walks toward the front door of the police
3154800	3155800	station.
3155800	3156880	I've moved a blocker.
3156880	3157880	What do you want to do?
3157880	3162880	I want you to wait a fucking hour while we take care of some shit and then get that gun
3162880	3167400	for your boss.
3167400	3168400	Quick question.
3168400	3169800	Are we going to bring her with us?
3169800	3170800	Yeah.
3170800	3171800	Yeah.
3171800	3172800	One hour.
3172800	3173800	That's fine.
3173800	3174800	One hour.
3174800	3175800	All right.
3175800	3176800	God damn it.
3177340	3179460	Is Drew, is Drew going to put up the signs for us?
3179460	3180460	Yeah.
3180460	3184580	Are we going to go here or are we going to, oh, yeah, we might not need that hour.
3184580	3185820	What are we doing with her hour?
3185820	3186820	So fucked.
3186820	3187820	Shit.
3187820	3188820	That's it.
3188820	3189820	We're going to go put the signs.
3189820	3190820	How far away is Perdition?
3190820	3191820	Hour.
3191820	3192820	One hour away.
3192820	3194320	Damn it.
3194320	3195320	She's stupid.
3195320	3196320	She doesn't know how long an hour is.
3196320	3197320	Well, that's what I'm saying.
3197320	3202040	Once we're in the car, like we can just drive somewhere and then she's still captive with
3202040	3203040	us.
3203280	3210200	Did you hear that Rosemary?
3210200	3212120	She looks up from her phone.
3212120	3213120	What?
3213120	3217160	I mean, our two options are either go to the city or go here.
3217160	3219760	I think we should have Drew put up the signs.
3219760	3220760	Yeah.
3220760	3221760	That'll make Clark feel better.
3221760	3223080	And then I think we should just go to the city.
3223080	3224080	Yeah.
3224080	3225560	And if we need to, we can stop here on the way back.
3225560	3226560	Okay.
3226560	3227560	Let's do it.
3227560	3230660	I want to call Drew and tell him, Drew, forget the cat carrier.
3230660	3232460	Would you come on back to the office?
3232460	3233460	Don't forget the cat carrier.
3233460	3234460	I've already got it.
3234460	3235460	Perfect.
3235460	3236460	Don't worry.
3236460	3237460	Then let's bring that on in.
3237460	3242820	When you get into the office on your desk, there's going to be a pile of flyers and a
3242820	3243820	list next to it.
3243820	3246780	And I want you to go and put a flyer at every place on that list.
3246780	3247780	Oh, okay.
3247780	3248780	Just tape it to the door.
3248780	3253700	Don't even, if somebody tries to stop you, just say the police are in control, turn on
3253700	3255860	your radio and listen to the message from dog.
3255860	3256860	Yeah.
3256860	3258580	Clark, I don't think anyone's going to stop me.
3258580	3260400	There's like nobody here.
3260400	3262360	This place is a ghost town.
3262360	3263360	What?
3263360	3265360	Like there's just nobody around.
3265360	3266360	Like I've been driving around.
3266360	3271360	I went to the, I went to the store and there's like no shoppers.
3271360	3272520	There's no cars driving around.
3272520	3273520	This is crazy.
3273520	3277280	I just like came in and grabbed the cat grabber.
3277280	3278280	What was it that I have?
3278280	3279280	Cat carrier.
3279280	3280280	A cat carrier.
3280280	3281280	Yeah.
3281280	3282280	That's what I grabbed.
3282280	3287320	And yeah, I just, uh, I waited at the checkout for a while, but, uh, nobody's, uh, you stole
3287320	3288320	it, Drew.
3288320	3289320	No, I didn't steal it.
3289320	3290320	I'm still waiting.
3291240	3294400	Oh, I give you permission to come on and come on back to the office.
3294400	3295880	Don't worry about putting cash down.
3295880	3297760	We'll, we'll get, we'll settle up with them later.
3297760	3298760	Oh, okay.
3298760	3300040	I'll just leave cash though.
3300040	3301040	Okay.
3301040	3302040	If it makes you feel better.
3302040	3303040	Okay.
3303040	3304040	And don't worry.
3304040	3306040	We're on it.
3306040	3307040	Yeah.
3307040	3308040	Same.
3308040	3309040	Cool.
3309040	3313840	We're all on it.
3313840	3314840	Shit.
3314840	3318720	The entire town disappearing does add a wrench to our plans.
3318720	3321660	Do we need to leave Drew around if there's nobody here?
3321660	3322660	Should he come with us?
3322660	3329240	You guys hear a car pull up in the parking lot of the police department and, uh, there's
3329240	3330240	a knock at the door.
3330240	3333960	You guys are standing kind of in the entryway and you look over and you see a woman.
3333960	3338440	Uh, she's an older woman with a big glasses, bigger hair.
3338440	3339440	She's knocking on the door.
3339440	3340960	Do I recognize her?
3340960	3342520	Yeah, I think you would.
3342520	3346860	Uh, this is Jan Manstein, Jan Manstein.
3346860	3349620	She is Ari's mother.
3349620	3354580	Ari is a, your co-worker, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3354580	3355580	Woman.
3355580	3356580	Fuck.
3356580	3362180	Who works in the police department and does a lot of stuff around town for you guys.
3362180	3363880	And this is her mom, Jan.
3363880	3365900	I wave at her through the glass.
3365900	3366900	Hey, Jan.
3366900	3367900	Hey, Jan.
3367900	3368900	What's going on?
3368900	3369900	Oh, hi.
3369900	3370900	Yeah.
3370900	3376820	Um, yeah, no, uh, I'm just here to, uh, I mean, I'm here to pick up.
3376820	3381600	Her things, uh, you know, she, she, she would have wanted that.
3381600	3385220	Maybe she wouldn't have, I don't know, but I got to get the stuff.
3385220	3386220	Maybe.
3386220	3388700	I don't know, but probably I should probably get it.
3388700	3389700	She'll need it.
3389700	3393380	So, uh, I just need to come inside, come inside.
3393380	3394380	So have a seat.
3394380	3395380	Yeah.
3395380	3400140	She walks in and she's like just completely scattered and she's like, Oh gosh, you know,
3400140	3406420	I, I just, I thought that, you know, uh, she would want me to, to have her, which desk
3406420	3408180	was, was Ari's.
3408180	3414940	What do you mean was, what do you mean was the fire in the city?
3414940	3417620	Ari's dead.
3417620	3418620	What fire?
3418620	3420300	The hospital fire?
3420300	3421460	Yes.
3421460	3424660	Is Clark saying who's Ari or is Clark totally aware who Ari is?
3424660	3425660	Ari's Ray.
3425660	3428220	I know we outside know that.
3428220	3429220	What's Clark doing right now?
3429220	3430460	Oh, that's a good point.
3430460	3434780	What are we doing every time we hear that Ray has a different name, you're immediately
3434780	3439340	confused and then you have a flood of memories with Ari.
3439340	3440340	Perfect.
3440340	3441340	Okay.
3441340	3442900	Did we send Ray to the hospital?
3442900	3443900	Yes.
3443900	3444900	Woof.
3444900	3453260	You sent Florence to the hospital in the ambulance with Rosemary after the skirmish, after we
3453260	3455500	shot hotel, hotel, right, right, right, right.
3455500	3464060	You sent Ari to keep an eye or Florence or Ray or Tim to keep an eye on Rosemary.
3464060	3465060	That's weird.
3465060	3466540	We forgot about that until just now.
3466540	3468660	Rosemary, can I talk to you for a minute?
3468660	3469660	Yeah.
3469660	3474460	And Clark, do you show her where Ari's desk was and so she begins collecting the belongings
3474460	3475460	of her daughter.
3475460	3476460	I'm very somber.
3476460	3479980	Jana, I'm, I can't tell you how sorry I am.
3479980	3485900	You know, you sign up for this life and you know, she, she always, she always knew that,
3485900	3492180	you know, go, gosh, maybe there would, you know, but you know, as a mother, you know,
3492180	3499380	you always think, you know, the, maybe everything will be all right, but maybe it won't, I,
3499380	3505740	it's just, it's hard, but, uh, I'm sure you'll all, you'll all be there tomorrow, right?
3505740	3507420	For the funeral, obviously.
3507420	3508420	Of course.
3508420	3509420	What, what time is that?
3509420	3512260	Uh, it's at, uh, it's, it's at 11 or 10.
3512260	3515180	I think it's, we're doing at 11, 10 30.
3515180	3516180	It's a 10 30.
3516180	3517180	No, no, no, no.
3517180	3518180	I decided on 11.
3518180	3519620	Yeah, no, it's 11.
3519620	3520620	It's all right.
3520620	3521620	We'll sign up for sure.
3521620	3522620	And we'll be there.
3522620	3525020	Did Rosemary burn down the hospital?
3525020	3526700	That's what I'm asking her.
3526700	3533420	Cut to John and Rosemary in the back room and she eyes the evidence locker door.
3533420	3535100	Are you going to give me the gun now?
3535100	3538340	Hey, first of all, Rosemary, you're never fucking getting that gun.
3538340	3540420	It's going directly into Marvin Glass's hands.
3540420	3545420	If it goes anywhere, you can escort it with us, but I'm not giving you the gun.
3545420	3546780	We clear on that.
3546780	3551220	First of all, uh, did you fucking burn down the hospital in the city and kill one of our
3551220	3552220	officers?
3552220	3553220	No.
3553220	3554220	Rosemary.
3554220	3555220	Come on.
3555220	3556220	No.
3556220	3557220	Rosemary.
3557220	3558220	Yeah.
3558220	3566220	Did you burn down the hospital?
3566220	3567220	Yeah.
3567220	3568220	Rosemary.
3568220	3570260	You know, mobsters go to the hospital.
3570260	3571260	The city needs a hospital.
3571260	3573740	Mobsters get hurt all the time.
3573740	3574740	They put me in.
3574740	3576140	I don't like handcuffs.
3576140	3577140	They put me in handcuffs.
3577140	3578140	I don't like handcuffs.
3578140	3579140	Well, you shot it, please.
3579140	3580140	Or, well, I guess we shot it.
3580140	3581460	You tried to stab Keith.
3581460	3583020	He tried to fucking shoot me.
3583020	3584980	Cause you were trying to stab Rosemary.
3584980	3586980	He came at me with a knife.
3586980	3587980	Okay.
3587980	3591380	Well, listen, that's not ideal.
3591380	3592820	That's not really cool.
3592820	3595140	Fully fucking aware, John.
3595140	3597020	All right.
3597020	3603940	Well, uh, can you just play it cool for like five fucking minutes because the mother of
3603940	3607420	the fucking cop you burned to death along with, what was it?
3607420	3608420	40 other people.
3608420	3609420	Yeah.
3609420	3611540	I didn't put that together, but she's out there right now.
3611540	3613400	I'm always cool, John.
3613400	3614900	That is literally never true.
3614900	3618340	So you guys walk back out into the station.
3618340	3625580	Jan is, uh, finishing packing up everything and oh gosh, I just, you know, I, Stan is
3625580	3628620	gonna, he's, he's gonna fall apart.
3628620	3629620	I just don't know.
3629620	3631420	I don't know what to tell him.
3631420	3633340	I, maybe I should, maybe I shouldn't.
3633340	3634340	Should I tell him?
3634340	3635340	What do you think?
3635340	3636340	Should I?
3636340	3637340	Would you like one of us to tell him?
3637340	3638340	Yes.
3638340	3639340	Yes.
3639340	3641340	No, no, no, no.
3641340	3642340	Yes.
3642340	3643340	Yes.
3643340	3644340	Yes.
3644340	3645340	Yeah.
3645340	3646340	Yes.
3646340	3647340	Please.
3647340	3650140	And then real quick, remind me where he lives and his exact relation to you so there's no
3650140	3651140	faux pas.
3651140	3652140	Oh yeah.
3652140	3653140	No.
3653140	3659140	Stan is, uh, my ex husband, Ari's father, uh, he's been in the city asylum for 28 years.
3659140	3662500	Oh, well as it just so happens, we're about to go up to the city.
3662700	3664580	So that might be pretty convenient.
3664580	3668060	If you could let him know, that would be, no, no, you shouldn't.
3668060	3670480	No, I should be the one to tell, no, you do it.
3670480	3671480	You do it.
3671480	3672480	No, I should be the one.
3672480	3673480	Okay.
3673480	3674480	Bye.
3674480	3675480	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
3675480	3676480	Okay.
3676480	3677480	Before you go.
3677480	3678620	Hey, do you see anybody else out in town when you came over here?
3678620	3680860	Well, contention is a small town, right?
3680860	3686420	I am never around here, but traffic on the roads, any people walking about, a bunch of
3686420	3687420	green lights.
3687420	3691860	I, well, I think I ran into one red maybe on the way in perhaps.
3691860	3692860	Yeah.
3692860	3693860	Um, have a good day.
3693860	3694860	Animals.
3694860	3699340	Wait, wait, wait, Jan, when we, when we talked to Stan, do you want us to tell him anything
3699340	3700560	for you?
3700560	3704980	Maybe like the last time you talked to Ari, maybe something she said then, do you remember
3704980	3706380	the last time you talked to her?
3706380	3707380	Yes.
3707380	3708380	Yeah.
3708380	3709380	It was, uh, it was just the other night.
3709380	3710380	What did she say?
3710380	3714620	She said, uh, her last words were, I'm going to bed now.
3714620	3715780	No, they were, I love you.
3715780	3718540	No, it was just that she'd just eaten Mac and cheese.
3718540	3719540	No, no, no.
3719860	3720860	She said, I love you.
3720860	3721860	And I said, I love you.
3721860	3722860	I can't.
3722860	3723860	That's fine.
3723860	3725580	We'll tell Stan that she, she said, I love you.
3725580	3727580	And then one last thing.
3727580	3730980	Does the name Ray mean anything to you?
3730980	3731980	No.
3731980	3732980	Florence?
3732980	3733980	No.
3733980	3734980	Okay.
3734980	3735980	Are those Ari's friends?
3735980	3737980	Yeah, those were Ari's friends.
3737980	3738980	Okay.
3738980	3739980	Um, okay.
3739980	3740980	I'll go.
3740980	3741980	Uh, I'll see you tomorrow.
3741980	3742980	It's in the city.
3742980	3744940	It's at the city cemetery.
3744940	3746500	She's going to be buried with her family.
3746500	3749020	So yeah, we'll definitely be there.
3749020	3751380	And she collects the things and leaves.
3751380	3756420	I turned to John, do you, you remember array and a Florence?
3756420	3757420	Yeah, man.
3757420	3758420	Yeah.
3758420	3761580	This is the first fucking time I've heard of Ari, but I feel like I've known her for
3761580	3763580	years.
3763580	3764580	Clark gets a chill.
3764580	3765700	I just got a chill.
3765700	3776700	Can you guys roll sanity, uh, fail, fail, say one on a 27.
3776700	3777700	Holy shit.
3777700	3781900	65 on an 18, 78 on a 27.
3781900	3782900	Wow.
3782900	3785740	You guys all lose one sanity.
3785740	3791740	All these different iterations of your coworkers start flooding into your brain and you can't
3791740	3793740	keep them separated.
3793740	3799940	They're all starting to combine into this strange amalgamation of this person that now
3799940	3803880	you can't remember any of what their faces look like.
3803880	3811160	You vaguely remember some names, some stories, but you never necessarily got close to this
3811160	3815560	person, but you remember their last name was Manstein.
3815560	3816560	Yeah.
3816560	3817560	Losers.
3817560	3818560	All of them.
3818560	3822560	I mean, they didn't really stick in your mind, but they were all Manstein.
3822560	3823560	Yeah.
3823560	3824560	Whoa.
3824560	3833800	Is that what close as he stumbles back?
3833800	3837440	Yeah.
3837440	3843840	And then you guys decide to, we're going to have drew put up those flyers and go to the
3843840	3844840	city.
3844840	3845840	Was that the last thing we settled on?
3845840	3846840	Yeah, I think so.
3846840	3850560	I would like a moment alone with Rosemary.
3850560	3851560	John and Rose.
3851560	3853680	Do you want to describe it?
3853680	3857600	Uh, well, first of all, um, does she still have the briefcase on her?
3857600	3858600	Oh yeah.
3858600	3859600	Okay.
3859600	3860600	She's not letting go of that.
3860600	3861600	Yeah.
3861600	3862600	So, uh, I take her into the back.
3862600	3863600	I'm like, Hey Rosemary.
3864400	3865400	Can we talk for a second real quick?
3865400	3866400	Yeah.
3866400	3867400	Okay.
3867400	3868400	Uh, just let's go into this room here.
3868400	3871360	So, uh, out at your shot of the boys.
3871360	3872360	You're there.
3872360	3875280	Um, and I slam her against the fucking wall and put a gun on her head.
3875280	3876280	She starts laughing.
3876280	3877280	Okay.
3877280	3881800	Well I cocked the trigger and I said, let go of the fucking briefcase and give drew
3881800	3886680	his money back right fucking now or what or I'll fucking kill you and talk to Marvin
3886680	3887680	Glass myself.
3887680	3890800	You think I care about some dumb ass like soldier.
3890800	3892000	You're nothing to me.
3892000	3896120	You want to get your job done and live to see the end of this day and give me that fucking
3896120	3897120	money.
3897120	3898120	Yeah.
3898120	3902400	All right, John.
3902400	3910680	And she drops the briefcase on to your hand and then she turns like she slowly turns.
3910680	3912000	You've got it pressed against her temple.
3912000	3919680	I'm guessing she slowly turns and puts it with the barrel right in between her eyes.
3919680	3930720	It's hilarious that you think that you can kill me.
3930720	3936360	And then she just walks away back into the room without the briefcase.
3936360	3938520	Okay.
3938520	3941000	John lets out a huge breath.
3941000	3947440	So yeah, John picks up the briefcase and I guess dashes it somewhere secure in the station
3947440	3949280	because I don't want the boys to see me with it.
3949280	3950280	For sure.
3950280	3952720	There's got to be a like a random evidence locker.
3952720	3954120	Like I just put it in a locker.
3954120	3955120	Okay.
3955120	3956600	You go into the evidence locker and put it in.
3956600	3957640	That's a good cover anyway.
3957640	3968000	It's evidence.
3968000	3972920	You hear a ding from the computer at the secretary's desk and there's a fresh email from both the
3972920	3973920	dog.
3973920	3975160	It says the PSA is about to play.
3975160	3978720	So this is what plays on the radio.
3978720	3986360	I'll do it in post but just so you guys fucking know.
3986360	3987360	Okay.
3987360	3989360	Not that.
3989360	3990360	Wrong station.
3990360	3991360	Yeah.
3991360	3992360	I click over.
3992360	3996360	And we're not using a spooky radio are we?
3996360	3997360	No.
3997360	3998360	We sure ain't.
3998360	3999360	Oh shit.
3999360	4000360	I'm sorry.
4000360	4001360	I'm sorry.
4001360	4002360	I'm sorry.
4002360	4003360	I'm sorry.
4003360	4004360	I'm sorry.
4004360	4005360	I'm sorry.
4005360	4006360	I'm sorry.
4006360	4007360	I'm sorry.
4007360	4008360	I'm sorry.
4008360	4012040	You're all flying through a vortex and your faces are melting and contorting and going
4012040	4017000	into one game over.
4017000	4021480	Hey, my babies.
4021480	4025280	It's both the dog hitting you with the weather on December 5th.
4025280	4031640	Now y'all know what's been really nice outside, but prepare for a cold freeze tonight.
4031640	4035000	Keep those sinks a dripping for your old buddy Wolf.
4035000	4037900	And Wolf got some breaking news for y'all today.
4037900	4040680	Straight from the mouth of the FBI.
4040680	4051520	Tension, a chemical spill from the unincorporated land, once the town Perdition, just west of
4051520	4053960	contention is heading this way.
4053960	4057080	Please evacuate immediately.
4057080	4060240	Don't forget your pets.
4060240	4063700	The boys in blue are here for you.
4063700	4064700	That's right.
4064700	4073960	The contention PD is your BFD, which stands for best friends and dependable.
4073960	4079040	Now Wolf the dog got some serious news on the wire from the city.
4079040	4083880	Ferguson beans and Joan Robin, the mother of Ferguson's business partner were found
4083880	4086660	dead in beans home early this morning.
4086660	4088400	Nothing confirmed.
4088400	4094040	But inside sources say Joan shot Ferguson multiple times with his own firearm before
4094040	4097280	turning the gun on herself.
4097280	4109920	Holy shit.
4109920	4111280	Look at Keith.
4111280	4112280	You told it.
4112280	4115300	Didn't you tell us one time you're part of the bean family?
4115300	4116300	Those bean boys.
4116300	4117300	You haven't told us yet, right?
4117300	4118300	That you're a bean?
4118300	4119300	Yeah.
4119300	4123340	And based on the way that we've been playing it, it's kind of this well known, it's an
4123340	4127760	open secret and you guys don't bring it up because you have to work with him and he clearly
4127760	4129620	fucking hates it.
4129620	4131940	That's why he changed his name to avoid it.
4131940	4138380	You've brought it up like once or twice and then he's ignored it and it's kind of gone
4138380	4146140	over, especially when you're ordering beans from beans on beans, your family's business.
4146140	4147980	And so it is an open secret.
4147980	4153780	So you do know that he is related to the beans, but you've never really discussed it.
4153780	4154780	Okay.
4154780	4156780	So I just want to look at him.
4156780	4158620	What do I see on his face?
4158620	4165460	I hear that news and I just, I am just looking down at the ground like blank expression.
4165460	4169660	Keith, we know you're a bean.
4169660	4170660	Yeah.
4170660	4172660	I knew you knew.
4172660	4174620	Who were they to you?
4174620	4175620	That was my brother.
4175620	4176620	God damn.
4176620	4177620	Keith.
4177620	4178620	I'm so, I'm so sorry.
4178620	4179620	Keith.
4179620	4180820	I haven't seen him in a while.
4180820	4181820	A long time.
4181820	4188060	We never really got along that well, but would you say it's been a while?
4188060	4195340	Oh no.
4195340	4198780	I kicked John.
4198780	4200740	I wouldn't have wished that upon him though.
4200740	4202620	But yeah, that was my brother.
4202620	4203620	Huh?
4203620	4205820	Well, it's, we're heading to the city.
4205820	4207780	We can take a look by the crime scene.
4207780	4208780	I mean, maybe.
4208780	4209780	Yeah.
4209780	4211420	Ask the local PD what they know.
4211420	4212420	Yeah.
4212420	4215740	I'd like to find out what they know and we'll do that.
4215740	4216740	Yeah.
4216740	4217740	Okay.
4217740	4218740	Let's do first things first though.
4218740	4220460	Let's there's goo.
4220460	4221460	There's goo to do.
4221460	4222460	There's goo to do.
4222460	4224700	If one beans died, I don't need to die from goo.
4224700	4227820	We got to figure out that after, after all this.
4227820	4228820	Yeah.
4228820	4230700	And again, just real sorry your brother got murdered, suicided.
4230700	4231700	Yeah.
4231700	4233580	I wish I could have, I don't know.
4233580	4234580	Been there.
4234580	4235580	The boys in the air.
4235580	4264580	How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you know I'm the only one trying to
4264580	4292580	pull over How can you know I'm the only one trying to pull over
