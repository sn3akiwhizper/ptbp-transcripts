180120	182860	with pretty sexual
210120	227620	the tops of trees thick enough to obscure any view of what is below and covered in a
227620	234220	layer of kudzu seem to go on endlessly up and down over hills and valleys mountains
234220	241720	and gorges there is nothing but dense verdant forest a circular calm lake finds itself somewhere
241720	247560	in the midst of this lush wilderness and in the middle of that lake a small island with
247560	253060	less than a quarter mile from shore to shore a long wooden dock on the north side of the
253060	259400	island leads to a charming two-story boat house with six well-kept cedar canoes tied
259400	265500	up below the second story apartment if the island is the face of a clock that dock is
265500	271660	at high noon there are six cute cozy little cottages evenly dispersed along the shore
271660	277920	of the island at one o'clock three o'clock five o'clock seven o'clock nine o'clock and
277920	284240	eleven o'clock five of the six cottages are in pristine condition the eleven o'clock place
284240	289840	might be too but it looks doubtful since the entire building is covered in a massive blue
289840	296480	tarp surrounding each of these cottages is truly master craft landscaping stunningly
296480	302140	gorgeous flowers in every shade and shape fill varied gardens and planters that somehow
302140	308760	both overrun the terrain and complement it perfectly each cottage has a cobblestone walkway
308760	313700	lined on either side by these lovely flower beds and the walkways all make their way to
313740	319100	the center of the island where a large equally cute and cozy hexagonal building sits
319100	330700	break y'all there is a small welcome sign on the south side of this building right at six
330700	340780	o'clock welcome to calm comfy campgrounds and then we go into this main building this main
340780	348020	large hexagonal building and inside we find a room that is circular the wall never ceasing
348020	354020	and never creasing at any point even where the wall meets the ceiling and the floor the angles
354020	361220	are rounded off there are six chairs in a half circle facing a single chair in front of them
361220	366420	each chair has a bottle of water next to it and standing around this room or sitting in
366420	371820	these chairs are the four of you along with two others let's go ahead and go around and
371820	378980	describe these characters who wants to start I'll start my guy is in a really nice white
378980	387420	seersucker suit a nice head of hair on him he's a he's it's slick back and nicely quaffed he's
387420	394940	got big thick rim glasses on and he's handsome and he looks like he takes care of himself and
394940	404580	on his arm is his wife Angela who is a lively young woman with a thick mane of curly hair in
404580	412060	a floral sundress with strappy leather sandals that go up above her ankles and the two of them
412060	423540	are in a corner of the room standing and talking yeah well hey there Joe hey there's that are you
423540	434900	ready for this yeah okay so we see Roger Fairfield and Angela Fairfield a nice young married couple
434900	442940	right standing at six o'clock on this large island surround island surrounded by Lake calm and you
442940	449860	guys are walking up a cobblestone pathway up to a large hexagonal building ahead of you you see
449860	456620	everything the flowers just verdant gardens all around bushes and trees make up much of this place
456620	462060	and through some of them on either side you can see these small cute little cottages tucked away
462060	467580	in their own little areas but ahead of you is this large hexagonal building and you said we were
467580	474740	walking up from six o'clock yes so we started at the south side of yes and Angela looks at you
474740	481540	and she's kind of like bouncing back and forth between from cobblestone to cobblestone and she's
481540	489500	like Raj I just think this is gonna be such a solid experience for you Roger kind of stretches
489500	498260	out he's in a nice white seersucker suit that's his leisure wear yeah yeah of course and he does
498260	505900	a big stretch take in that sweet lake air and that that's that's real nice in it it's beautiful
505900	512100	I'm so glad that we could just get away and really focus on like finding our emotions and really
512100	518540	being able to communicate right Raj I don't know about all that but I'm happy to go along with
518540	524340	whatever you think is gonna help us I think it's gonna be great and she like twirls out and spins
524340	530860	and it's really taking in the Sun is beating right down on you guys and it is a gorgeous day
530860	539820	here at calm comfy campgrounds but as she's spinning her arms wide stretched taking in all
539820	552060	the vitamin D she can get Jesus I'm the worst you notice that on her arm on the inside of one of her
552060	560340	arms track marks that you have not noticed before and she stops spinning kind of like crumbles into
560340	565820	herself and looks at you she's kind of lurches toward you and throws her arms around your neck
565820	573740	and it's like this is gonna be a perfect weekend to start our marriage off on the right foot kind
573740	582500	of hesitantly but mindfully avoiding asking about those marks yes if you think it's gonna
582500	588980	help us I I'll do what I can turning around you see the sign for calm comfy campgrounds and you
588980	596660	walk up on to this large hexagonal building it's like made of wood almost like like a rustic
596660	604100	hunting house however it seems more modern than that it has certain amenities and you would know
604100	617180	calm comfy campground is a luxury so this is not just a cabin in the woods it's not it's different
617180	624980	than that it's on a island that's on a lake that's in the woods it's completely different gotcha a
624980	632500	cabin on the lake in the woods at the bottom of the ocean the main building this hexagonal
632500	640620	building is similarly bestroon with delightful flowers made of many shades and shapes and as
640620	647940	you guys walk in the inside is equally rustic and elegant and modern and there's a massive wooden
647940	654620	chandelier hanging over the foyer on the desk to your right is a bell with a sign that says please
654780	661900	boop for assistance and a vase with a single red rose there's a little area back there with a chair
661900	667380	but it's currently empty and then you notice on your left there's a table with a coffee pot and a
667380	673740	water cooler on either side of a bowl of fruit Roger's gonna walk over to that Bell and see that
673740	680500	sign huh don't mind if I do and it says boop as he rings says boop as your answer of course you
680500	690740	have to go ahead and roll alertness oh boy first roll or since you're listening for someone coming
690740	701540	roll search okay damn it I failed an 86 on a 60 oh damn I still fail there's just silence and you
701540	707220	don't hear anything but then now that taking up your oral connection in your brain is a slight
707220	714860	little you turn back around there she is Angela with a flask in her hand just like taking a quick
714860	721380	pull and she like puts it down and wipes her mouth she's like some coffee and water over here I mean
721380	727460	that's fine I assume they would have a bar but it's kind of early to be starting in it and Angela
727460	732180	I don't I don't know if we should be drinking before we start are we not on vacation oh you're
732180	737180	right I guess the work is something we can focus on at a sober time that's fine that's fine that's
737180	741460	makes sense and then she puts it back in her little clutch that she was carrying you guys
741460	746260	would have had luggage with you I was just about to ask have we been to our cottage yet no you have
746260	753020	not okay so are you carrying yeah suitcases yeah okay once we once we get checked in then maybe we
753020	757020	can break out the flask I just think that we should focus you know make sure our heads are
757020	761580	clear when they give us instructions and things like that she walks up to you slowly puts her
761580	768820	hand on your chest I just knew that once we got here you would be receptive and you'll make the
768820	777660	best go of this possible I love you look love you too Angie that goes without saying well that was
777660	785540	weird yeah we're gonna get real weird together Oh Joe maybe Oh babe
792580	800220	Thomas my character is off on his own it's the circular room there's no corners but it looks
800220	805540	like he's somehow managed to like squeeze himself into a corner kind of space you don't know how
805540	811420	he's done it but how is he done it he's he's created like he is just projecting this air of
811420	818680	like impenetrable personal space around him and he is he has a pager in one hand and he's looking
818680	823840	down at it and he's talking on a big old-fashioned cell phone in the other hand kind of quietly he's
823840	831080	wearing a nondescript CSU gray hoodie jeans and sneakers and a baseball cap and sunglasses
831080	837000	indoors and you are having a difficult time hearing the person at the other end of your
837000	846240	phone call as the service keeps cutting in and out what did you say and what I I'm having a
846240	853380	difficult time hearing you as the service keeps cutting in and out so good so good wow that was
853380	869120	realistic Thomas Zach you ready yeah Bradley Cooper is standing at six o'clock on the bottom
869120	878640	of this island the listeners can know right yes okay how about this be Bradley Cooper aka other
878640	888240	way around Bradley Cooper okay Martin Cooper are you not also known as so Martin Cupertino
888240	893120	I'll use your real name yeah I mean like if we're solo just call me Martin okay yeah and then
893120	898720	anytime I have to interact with somebody I'll lie okay sounds good I will too and I'll be really good
898720	905760	at it I'm sure I'll never slip up so Martin you're standing at six o'clock on this island and in
905760	912800	front of you is a long cobblestone pathway leading to a large hexagonal building this is the main
912800	921040	main Lodge for the calm comfy campground on either side of this cobblestone pathway or flower beds
921040	927720	just filled with these beautiful flowers of all different shape and shade and on either side of
927840	936440	you are just tons of bushes and trees and greenery it would be decently thick to have to walk through
936440	942840	but you can kind of see through on either side these beautiful little cozy cottages that are
942840	949920	lined out evenly across the island on the shore of this circular island standing there kind of
949920	956880	looking around you notice that kind of behind you off to the side a little bit there's a man
956880	964600	short stout man in his later years older guy he's got a thick white beard he's wearing a dark
964600	972960	navy beanie and a wool plaid shirt under olive corduroy overalls and he is just staring out at
973040	979680	the water Martin takes a deep breath and does it smell does it smell good it smells strange it's
979680	986120	it's it's not a smell that you've smelled before but with the Sun shining down from directly above
986120	994120	on you and this beautiful scenery it makes the smell seem nice is there at least also a smell
994120	1000320	of nature around oh yeah absolutely okay he's he takes a deep breath and he's he inhales and he's
1000320	1006600	not dissatisfied and he notes the guy behind him he also he doesn't take the time to stop and smell
1006600	1014360	the flowers but he does make an interested note of them but he just walks straight on to the to
1014360	1018600	the main cabin absolutely and when you get up there there is a sign in front of the building
1018600	1025400	that says welcome to calm comfy campground and when you walk the main building that you're
1025480	1031320	walking into is similarly bestroon with all these delightful flowers of many shades and shapes and
1031320	1037800	when you walk in the inside is similarly rustic and elegant there's a massive wooden chandelier
1037800	1045120	hanging over the foyer and you see that there is a couple standing right in front of you a young
1045120	1052720	couple the woman in a sundress and the man in a white seersucker suit and they are holding each
1052720	1061840	other and an embrace I lower my baseball cap down I just yeah I kind of shrink into my hoodie make
1061840	1067360	sure my sunglasses aren't real well and I walk by them and I'm trying to find a check-in or something
1067360	1073040	looking for a check-in immediately to your right you notice that there's a desk with a bell and a
1073040	1079760	sign that says please boop for assistance also on top of the desk is a vase with a single red rose
1079760	1085280	in it Martin is pretty pleased because his expedience has brought him a moment where he
1085280	1092360	can stop and smell this rose he says to himself the shark who stops moving dies but if he gets to
1092360	1098360	where he's going he might get to smell some blood he boops the bell and and waits
1098360	1111520	Joe hey Roger here's the ding of the bell over at the desk pulling away from the embrace that

1570600	1577680	trees and lush bushes and on either side of the cobblestone walkway there are flower beds filled

1630840	1635960	something that came about through nurture Walter walks up to the sign and just kind of runs his

1645640	1651320	let's go check in and he takes your both of your suitcases in his hands and he's walking up the
1651320	1660040	steps and he opens up the door into a very both like rustic and elegant foyer there's a large
1660040	1669760	wood for you for yet I wish that I could burp father one day one day we'll go up and as you

1682720	1689640	or candles lights everything in here is super rustic and like old-looking but modern also very
1689640	1699280	modern and looks like it was quite a penny pretty pretty pretty pretty penny was spent no a penny
1699280	1707200	pretty was yes yes and there's a desk with a little bell on it and next to the bell there's
1707200	1712600	a sign that says please boop for assistance and there's a vase with a red rose in it and
1712600	1720240	to your left there is a table with a coffee pot and a water cooler and in between there's a bowl
1720240	1727280	of fruit Walter looks at his dad and approaches the desk looking into his dad's eyes places his
1727280	1734160	hand over the bell and looks for some sort of acknowledgement Alan raises his eyebrows ding
1734160	1740560	ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding and Alan smiles when you first ring the bell but
1740560	1748800	as you continue to ring the bell his smile starts to fade and he's like what Walter Walter yes that's

1755560	1761200	Walter yes father I think we're good on the bell if they didn't hear that then I don't think they're
1761240	1769160	close enough to hear it oh that's okay what should I do now I think we just wait and he
1769160	1776040	grabs a cup and starts pouring himself some coffee I stand at the desk I put my head down
1776040	1785800	like this and I like what audio medium I put my head down chin on chest standing there completely
1786040	1791400	still and ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding
1796400	1803640	who's up next Charles Digby is also in his own kind of corner of the room so he can keep an
1803640	1809760	eye on everybody kind of observe the situation Charles Digby is like six feet tall little above
1809800	1816040	average average weight brown kind of like a little shaggy a little unkempt hair but still
1816040	1822120	kind of combed over just nice enough to not attract any attention to himself brown eyes
1822120	1829920	kind of scruffy facial hair he likes to keep it average as a like a button-up shirt kind of little
1829920	1837160	messy undid not tucked in jeans some nice leather shoes and yeah he's just kind of a what would you
1837160	1844040	call surveying the room kind of trying to get a feel for everybody there love it
1850760	1858560	hey Justin hi what's up man nothing how about you I am very very excited for our session tonight and
1858560	1865320	I'm also very very excited to have you on the show with an actual with an actual character
1865320	1874840	you gotta have an actual character otherwise it not less fun so I'll definitely remember your last
1874840	1883280	name Digby this time yeah can you remember the first name nope and so Charles Digby is standing
1883280	1889320	at six o'clock on this island if the island was a clock face you were at six o'clock and leading
1889320	1896480	in front of you is a cobblestone pathway up to a large hexagonal building that is both rustic and
1896480	1902040	modern it's made mostly wood but there's big glass windows all over it and on either side of the
1902040	1908480	cobblestone leading up to this building are these large flower beds filled with these gorgeous
1908480	1914120	flowers that take over most of this island however on either side of the fire beds you see a bunch of
1914120	1928920	trees and bushes and a very active earth bio things fauna yeah fauna and flora hell yeah there's
1928920	1935640	so much flora no flauna you can see there's no desert there's no custardy desert there's not
1935640	1942280	unfortunately maybe inside maybe inside so as you're walking up you see in the distance through
1942280	1948160	these trees there's these cottages laid out at one o'clock three o'clock five o'clock seven
1948160	1953880	o'clock nine o'clock and eleven o'clock on this island and through all this dense tree line and
1953880	1958520	stuff you can still see these cottages they're tucked away and you notice with your keen
1958520	1967360	investigative eyes so this is an automatic success because your alertness and your search I'm
1967360	1978400	guessing are super fucking high yes confirmation and so on top of cottage three which is immediately
1978400	1983240	to your right as you're walking up to this large building you see down this long cobblestone
1983240	1990000	pathway this cottage and on top of the roof of that cottage just far in the distance but with
1990000	2000320	your eagle eyes you see a young girl with pigtails on top and she's messing with some wiring hmm can
2000320	2005960	I get a little closer take a look at that yeah sure my investigative nature would be like I
2005960	2010960	gotta see what's going on yeah you'll have to get off the trail the path and go through some of the
2010960	2016400	trees unless you want to go into this building and then around the side yeah let's do that yeah
2016400	2025520	as you're walking through the brush you notice that she pulls out binoculars oh I'm familiar
2025520	2032840	with these items and they are pointed directly at you you're not so used to being on this side
2032840	2040800	of binoculars yeah I think I would uh awkwardly wave to like acknowledge like hi can I can see
2040800	2046600	you seeing me just like like a kind of an awkward like raise of the hand immediately she dips back
2046600	2054720	behind this like roof area and is out of sight okay I think I think I'd maybe still keep walking
2054720	2059360	towards that way or would this be weird what I would I know not to you wouldn't know anything
2059360	2066720	okay yeah I'll just I will investigate that's what that's what I do baby yeah as you're walking
2066760	2073920	closer and closer you see this little girl take off running from behind cottage three and she's
2073920	2080200	running along the shoreline of the lake toward cottage number one I will kind of like hurriedly
2080200	2086680	follow hey hey what are you doing like trying to get her attention see if she responds at all she
2086680	2092760	does not turn back and she continues to run toward the cottage and you see she goes around the back
2092760	2099680	of the cottage and disappears I'm gonna with a hurried a little pep in my step hurry towards
2099680	2105800	it just to be like what's what's going on here yeah so moving through all these trees and branches
2105800	2111680	and brambles you make your way into a small clearing where this cottage is and it's really
2111680	2119000	cute and there's a nice little front door and a window in front and windows on the sides and you
2119000	2125040	see some movement through one of the side windows and you think it's basically the rough outline of
2125040	2131480	a small person can I look through the windows without it being like creepy that is entirely
2131480	2138640	up to the people who watch you creep them yeah I'm gonna try and do a little like like how I would
2138640	2143840	do like some kind of like stealthy search maneuvers creep up to the window and be able to
2143840	2150080	like peek roll alert actually first roll stealth sorry I haven't rolled with a character and so
2150080	2157120	so very long yeah this is is this the first one and the one shot for the patreon oh yeah but yeah
2157120	2165600	this is the first like this character isn't just hastily Justin party time party time for Justin
2165600	2177280	with pretending people couldn't remember the name of the show I pass 65 on a 70 okay so looking
2177280	2182960	through this window you see that there is this young girl with pigtails and she is wearing
2182960	2190800	overalls with a little striped shirt underneath overalls and she is sitting at the kitchen counter
2190800	2198280	and eating a sandwich and then walking in from the other room is an average build man he looks
2198280	2205480	to be in his late 30s but his eyes have aged and his hair his grade like someone who is in the war
2205480	2212000	or went through some sort of traumatic experience he's wearing a white dress shirt gray slacks and
2212000	2220120	black shoes and he walks over pours a glass of milk and slides it over to the girl who then
2220120	2228000	drinks it okay I feel like a fucking creep I feel like a creep number one but I feel like I would
2228000	2234720	like try to dip out at this point because it looks like that's probably her dad or something yeah I
2234720	2242200	think at this point I'd be like oh I shouldn't be doing this like oh stealth it again nope it'll
2242200	2246840	count so you are enrolled a successful stealth we get up to that spot so you know exactly how
2246840	2253240	to get out of this spot yeah I will duck out to be like okay time to stop being a creep so now
2253240	2258240	the question you're at one o'clock do you want to enter the main building from that side of the
2258240	2262680	island or do you want to go all the way back around is there a reason we were going to the
2262680	2267800	there was just that was where you were and there was a sign on that side of the building that said
2267800	2274160	welcome to calm comfy campground and you see no such sign from this side okay yeah I'll go to the
2274200	2281520	main building okay so you walk back through all this brush and all these trees and bushes and I
2281520	2290400	need you to roll an alertness check for me crit success 22 on a 70 crit success yeah that's
2290400	2300160	fucking awesome so my first ever as you're walking your foot your toe cap hits a wire
2300160	2308760	and it lifts up off the ground as you step and immediately your eyes follow this wire to a tree
2308760	2317960	and then looking about 12 feet up the tree you see the small lens of a camera that's poking out
2317960	2324560	from a knot in this tree what the fuck can I investigate it yeah what do you want to do how
2324560	2329200	high up did you say it was 12 feet I'm gonna try and like clamber up it a little bit yeah
2329200	2335960	roll survival or athletics to climb up this tree because sometimes climbing a tree is for your
2335960	2342000	survival I'll do athletics because I ain't got no survival I'm from the city man what's your
2342000	2352840	athletics 50 all right roll it up hard fail okay so trying to get up this tree you realize that
2352840	2357520	there aren't any branches low enough and there's no like grips on this tree that are in the direct
2357640	2362720	area to begin a climb so you can't even get off the ground I think I'll just leave it alone for
2362720	2367560	now because I'm I would assume it's for some kind of security or something and I don't want to like
2367560	2373080	knock it out with a rock or anything so I would I'm just gonna be like okay that's weird maybe
2373080	2379520	I'll come back here later sounds good yeah so when you walk back around to the front of this
2379520	2384640	large building you see that sign and there are two double doors on a porch a couple steps up to
2384640	2390400	a porch and then the double doors going in I go ahead and enter upon entrance you see this
2390400	2397480	beautiful rustic and elegant lobby with a large wooden chandelier hanging above you to your right
2397480	2406080	there is a young boy and to your left there is an old man and I'll bring Luke into the building
2406080	2412520	which one do you think he is the young boy yeah God for the voices sake I hope it's a young boy
2412520	2427240	not as creepy old man voice is it anything like people puby so at that exact moment the recording
2427240	2435760	cut out and we ran out of space on that hard drive perfectly timed because Luke and Justin
2435760	2445120	went on with that voice for a while well I got just enough time to really get into it and now
2445120	2457720	I'm changing my voice Jesus so Charles Digby you walk into this foyer look up see everything that
2457720	2465080	you saw you see this kid on your right who is just incessantly ringing a bell that is on the
2465080	2474040	desk yeah this older man is like Walter and then they both turn back and look at you keep

2638280	2644840	and you realize that oh shit I was I was gonna try to check in but at that moment the back door
2644840	2652680	right behind the desk opens and a young man wearing cowboy boots blue jeans a plaid pearlsnap button

2747560	2758680	I'm following kind of behind a little bit though and then we go into this main building this main
2758680	2766160	large hexagonal building and inside we find a room that is circular the wall never ceasing and
2766160	2772240	never creasing at any point even where the wall meets the ceiling and the floor the angles are
2772240	2779120	rounded off there are six chairs and a half circle facing a single chair in front of them
