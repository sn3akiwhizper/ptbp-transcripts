0.00 198.44 speaker0  Long time no see, my pack of pups, it's friend of all canines, Wolf the dog, howling at y'all from 694.2 PTBP, voted contention's number one radio show that you leave on so your dogs won't feel lonely while you're at work. Now y'all know we got some words from our listeners who have taken the time to shout us out on social media. It's time for Howlin' with Wolf. Wolf, I'd like to shout out to the lovely police force that we have here in contention. I appreciate the stellar job they doin' in keeping us, the citizens, safe. Why, if they weren't such good officers we might have things like busloads of transients or people dying of blunt force trauma, hell yeah, or even dangerous men on the streets disguised as police. I sure am glad that we don't have to worry about anything like that here in contention because of the work those fine officers put in. From Kennedy. Thanks Kennedy for believin' in our local police heroes without even the slightest awareness of your own surroundings. Now quick, turn the radio off now before you learn a thing or two, it's time for the news. The officers implemented an actually decent plan for a sting operation but the FBI was watching and steppin' in on the whole thing. Agents Kennedy and McKinley are in town lookin' for a black Nike bag with nothin' in it. The federal agents have agreed to meet the contention squad tomorrow mornin' December 4th at the police department. When the party met up at the station to figure out what to do with their illegal seizures, Drew was uncommonly not at his desk, replaced instead by a note telling them that he went to the chief's house. Officers Bishop and Bettymore hauled off the undocumented loot to their individual residences while Keith went to the chief's house to check on ol' Drew. Officers Bishop and Bettymore were soon called to the chief's house after it had exploded leaving the unconscious officer Vigna and Drew Andrews in the cold yard. That explosion also left behind the burnt bodies of Harold Dorsey, Chief Maggie Cook and an unkempt man with a bullet hole in his head and his face in a pile of foot meat. Foot meat, good feet, could eat, would eat. Sorry my dearest, I just done broke but puttin' me back together is kudzu with no backbone.
197.44 229.28 speaker2  Drew? I wanted to talk to like one of the firefighters, was anybody in there, did anybody in there make it? No! That's what I figured. Keith who was in there besides the chief? So I knocked on the door and the door just kinda opened up by itself and it wasn't on fire at this point? No but I walked in and it smelled like gasoline and the gas from like a stove. So I walked in and I immediately saw Drew and some guy, whatever that, whoever's ID
227.52 234.64 speaker1  That fake newsman from the city.
229.92 330.20 speaker2  And then I looked over and I walked in a little more and I saw Maggie just, her face was all slashed up and her left foot was missing and I walked in because I could smell the gas so I walked into the kitchen to turn the burners off before there was an explosion or anything but as soon as I turned the corner I saw another guy slumped over on the kitchen table with a fork in his hand and his left foot was missing too and all four burners were on the stove and there were two feet in a skillet and all the meat had been picked off of them and as soon as I went off, went over to turn them off I just felt dizzy and I threw up and I kind of, I like had to fall down and I hit something with my hand and as soon as I hit something with my hand, something ticked at the front of the house and a flame just started coming from the line of gasoline and I grabbed the fire extinguisher and I tried to put it out as best I could but I slipped and fell in my own vomit. of had to jump over the bodies to keep spraying the fire and I realized that I didn't know how much of use that was so I turned around and I knew I couldn't get both the guys so I grabbed Drew and I just hauled out of there and I think as soon as we got out of the front the door had exploded and just threw us back and then I was unconscious after that. Yeah, when I fell down I hit something with my hand like a wire or a trap or something to start the fire. Well, Clock, we know we didn't start the fire. It was there before us.
329.20 340.20 speaker1  It was always burning. What the fuck? Well this is horrific.
336.16 348.68 speaker2  I didn't see anybody eat the feet but they were cooked and the meat was picked off of the feet.
343.86 355.00 speaker1  I think we need to, someone, maybe you should pick through Drew's poop for the next two days and make sure they don't find their toenails.
350.00 364.82 speaker2  It did smell like poop when I walked in there and I don't know if anybody asked Drew if
362.08 367.00 speaker1  The guy at the table slumped over with the fork.
366.00 389.92 speaker2  Nothing about him? Luckily I didn't.
387.48 390.92 speaker1  But there's some that I don't.
389.92 407.46 speaker2  Damn. Was this for something that you told me or was this for something that I would have known if I got...
406.46 410.46 speaker1  you during this.
409.46 411.46 speaker2  Just tell me.
410.46 418.10 speaker1  Yeah, no. Yeah.
417.10 420.10 speaker0  Yeah, that's me.
419.10 423.74 speaker2  John Peters. God dammit.
421.10 430.78 speaker1  John Lee Pettymore, uh, Contention PD. Hey John. Hey. I've met many times working in a small town. Of course. I'm fireman chief.
429.78 442.18 speaker2  Yeah.
437.50 485.86 speaker1  year to the, uh, fireman policemen volleyball tournament. Uh, you got any idea where this fire started or how it started? the thing that really started the fire. The gasoline definitely helped keep the fire going and made it very difficult for us to do our jobs. It's interesting you say both those things because I was unclear while others were telling the story whether they meant, at first it seemed like they were smelling gasoline and then they, the burners were on. the entire place and also just sitting around.
484.86 489.90 speaker2  Did you get that?
488.90 515.62 speaker1  I didn't get it. Yeah. Yeah. You just keep working on that man. Meet me down here. Down. Meet me down here. Down. Meet me down here. Down.
512.34 526.68 speaker2  I don't know who that other guy in there was. How badly are, is the bones burnt?
525.68 536.58 speaker1  I look at the bones. Three bodies in the house. Oh, okay. I was thinking the other guy got out or something.
535.58 568.70 speaker2  I didn't think. No, there was, there was the reporter. Drew, Maggie, and the guy with the fork with the missing foot and Maggie and the guy that I don't know were the only two with their feet cut off. I assume that Maggie and her foot cut off and the guy that she was with foot cut off his own foot and Maggie's foot. Gross.
567.70 605.14 speaker1  Awesome. Someone should be able to match their dental records. Hey, can't, hey man, you know, I know it's your dream and everything. We lost our chief tonight. There's two more dead. Can you be real with me, Carl? Fucking just talk to me like, like Carl we all went to high school with.
601.58 606.14 speaker2  Who's the only dentist in contention?
605.14 608.14 speaker1  You mean for the dental records? Dr. Teeth?
607.14 609.14 speaker2  Yeah, for the dental records.
608.14 616.14 speaker1  Is that how that works? Well, actually, probably. Yeah, it probably is. You have to get him from a dentist.
615.14 620.14 speaker0  You've got to find him at the dentist.
619.14 628.82 speaker2  We're good cops. Dr. Millare.
627.82 636.30 speaker1  Yeah, Dr. Millare. Chief's Cruiser wasn't here.
634.82 651.30 speaker2  That's what I was going to get at. Was the Chief's Cruiser even here? No, no, no. She wasn't. Good call. And I'm going to go through Drew's car, even though he's standing right over there.
650.30 661.14 speaker1  Cool. Okay, so there was a bullet hole in his head.
659.18 671.26 speaker2  He was slumped over a plate of meat. Foot meat? Looking back now on it, I assume foot meat and both feet were in the skillet with meat picked off of them.
667.66 678.66 speaker1  Do you remember seeing a bunch of blood in like the kitchen or anything? Like were the floors covered in blood?
673.26 683.90 speaker2  From like the stab wounds, all over Maggie's face was blood and then from leaking out of their feet.
680.26 689.58 speaker1  Because if you had cooking feet and then also a foot miss and I just wondered if he was going back and forth or not.
685.22 699.46 speaker2  Yeah, well from what I could see, like what I slipped on was my own vomit and a bunch of puke. I mean a bunch of blood. And a bunch of puke. And your own puke. And my own puke. Oh god.
696.94 726.54 speaker1  There's a lot of bodily fluids in this scene. This is the first time since we've been roleplaying where I'm actually like legitimately grossed out and horrified. Yeah.
725.54 727.54 speaker2  Gross.
726.54 733.74 speaker1  Clean it up. Yeah, let's do that.
732.74 739.62 speaker2  We could play too. That'd be fine. Same difference.
738.62 748.14 speaker1  What if we alternate? That doesn't work. Let's pair off. I call Luke. No, no, no.
747.14 755.78 speaker2  I'm sitting by Luke. Guys. Okay. We were talking about the firefighter and then what? Oh, the dental records.
753.58 764.90 speaker1  Yeah, we were talking about how. maybe. Dr. Millar.
763.90 767.06 speaker2  Dr. Millar.
766.06 768.06 speaker1  Real talk though.
767.06 774.06 speaker2  We got to go to bed. I was, I was trying to. Yeah.
773.06 779.62 speaker1  Also the doctor is not going to be, he's going to be asleep right now. I don't know about you guys, but I'm fine.
776.06 789.38 speaker2  So we should probably go to sleep and then we can talk to Dr. Millar after we deal with the FBI.
785.74 800.78 speaker1  I didn't even think about that. you up in real life.
797.14 820.98 speaker2  I'm not really, I didn't take any damage or anything that I got out of there. I was just kind of in shock for a minute. Maybe I don't have eyebrows anymore. I don't have eyebrows anymore. False eyebrows. Strong character choice. As Keith Vigna, I would love to go to my bed and fall asleep.
819.98 822.98 speaker1  Yeah. It seems good.
821.98 828.34 speaker2  Same.
824.86 860.50 speaker1  Do a search on the charred remains of the chief's house. And also were you, you tried to get into her car. You couldn't. Yep. Good one. Good. Boom. Clark, you go and check the chief's cruiser and it is clean. There is nothing inside of it. Not even a steering wheel or seats. Not even a steering wheel or seats. There is however, no detritus or any other information. Can I look in the glove box? You look in the glove box. It is empty. Weirdly enough.
859.00 881.86 speaker2  Does she have a dash cam?
879.82 901.82 speaker1  Where was this car earlier today? Examining records. It was at the mill on the other side of the city. This car was at the mill on the other side of the city. Is that right? Three days.
899.18 911.02 speaker2  I mean, it's like the evening of December.
908.86 938.54 speaker1  Is what the computer says back to you. Cop net. Thank you cop net. Officer Bishop.
937.34 957.02 speaker2  I'm going home to go to sleep.
955.82 982.10 speaker1  Clark, what are you talking? I think you need some rest. You know, cop net. In fact, I think it's where she went after she left the station after I gave her her
981.10 986.10 speaker2  What's at the mill. I don't know. I think that's something we need to investigate tomorrow. Tomorrow.
985.10 992.02 speaker1  Some grist.
989.82 1008.02 speaker2  I shut it and I drive home.
1007.02 1011.02 speaker1  99. 95.
1010.02 1013.02 speaker2  That's a bad roll.
1012.02 1141.42 speaker1  Hey, I'd like to search that house. Cool. of evidence bags and then carrying them toward the burning embers of this house to collect evidence in these bags. Do you? That's what I'm picturing currently. I'm always picturing more just a stroll through the house, you know, through the wreckage to try to find anything of significance. Sure. Mostly. The explosion took out a lot of the brick from the back of the house where the explosion seems to have come from and the roof has been blown off and the insides are completely melted and charred, but the structure itself still slightly stands. The structure itself still slightly stands. One thing for sure. This was a house. Nailed it. Go ahead and roll that search roll for me. All right. Awesome. So as you go through, you can collect the burnt remains of three bodies. Seems like a medical examiner. I don't know if they'd just let me, even as a cop, if they'd just let me be here on my own poking around like bagging up bodies. Her name is Sheila. Is she Australian? She got called at like two in the morning. Hey, come to contention, this town that you have to drive like 45 minutes to. Oh, she's from the city? Yeah.
1140.42 1152.46 speaker2  Yeah.
1144.98 1179.86 speaker1  She's weary eyed and upset and helping you collect the evidence of these three charred remains of bodies. Sheila, in your... Sorry. In your medical opinion, how would you say these folks died? Burned. I don't want to be inappropriate like with you, but the Australian accent is truly beautiful. Your husband must be a lucky man. You want to help me pick up these bones? She begins collecting bones. Okay. All right. Simply breathtaking.
1178.86 1183.70 speaker0  There's more over here.
1180.86 1195.22 speaker1  I think you got that then there Sheila. I don't think you're really Australian. You can actually find the pistol that was in the hand of the man in the kitchen.
1194.22 1199.98 speaker2  Okay.
1196.22 1230.46 speaker1  And you can find the knife that was in the hand of Chief Maggie Cook. The knife was in her hand. She had a large chef's knife in her left hand. Okay. And you can also find lots of gas cans, metal gas cans are strewn. There are probably seven of them. Okay. The knife, well, roll forensics for me.
1229.46 1232.46 speaker2  For now.
1231.46 1237.58 speaker1  Yep. That's hold it up to the holes. To the holes in the skull.
1236.26 1256.78 speaker2  That's a, wow. That's a crit fail.
1250.54 1323.98 speaker1  rifle around and a lot of her face and skull disintegrate onto itself. Oh shit. So you might not be able to get super accurate results back from that. I can make whatever- we? That was funny, but can we wreck on that? I'll take every crit failure as strongly as I possibly can. While poking through all this stuff and then severely fucking up the corpse of your former boss.
1322.98 1330.62 speaker2  Okay, awesome.
1329.62 1440.74 speaker1  Yes. Couldn't agree more. On a 100. So congratulations. No, it's on a 16. Your search check was for inside the house, which you succeeded on, so you got everything inside the house, but the alertness check was for something that's totally fair. Wish I hadn't destroyed the Chief's face. I bet it'll be fine. That image is going to stay with me. Just digging around in there as it completely falls apart. ready to take back in the morning. That should help get you to sleep. So you're not going to be able to fall asleep for too long tonight. In fact, I'm going to have you roll power in order to get even a decent night's rest. So roll against your POW. Crit success. Nice. Then you're going to be able to force your cocaine-addled mind right to sleep. The Pennymores are famously clear of mind. Your eyes close. Zach, I'm right here. Zach, no, no, no. I'm right here. Not for the podcast, that's for us. That was a dumb joke. You're trying to do something serious instead of mood. And I was just like, so anyway.
1439.74 1441.74 speaker2  You come to...
1440.74 1519.76 speaker1  Edit point. You come to and the sky is dark, but the ground begins to give light to the world. You see a man in the distance with his head and hands in stocks that sit on an inky black stage. As you walk toward this man, the ground becomes wider and wider like a screen's brightness level being gradually turned up. You hear a holler from behind you and when you turn around, you see your mother. She looks like she did when she was about your age and she is crying. You don't have to do this. We can leave. We can run. The door floats up into the sky and sitting behind it is that trunk. You locked up in the police department with the woman's split head atop the black putrid hacked up anatomy. You turn around and you are face to face with the man in the stocks, John Peters, his forehead burned and peeling with the word fool desperate.
1513.40 1526.80 speaker0  His eyes widen and he whispers, please, it's coming. They cannot stop it.
1524.62 1639.14 speaker1  You have to save everyone. That's a two hello world. And uh, you're heading to the station to meet up with, um, your partners as well as the Joe Clark makes it back to his home where he is almost finished unloading all the stuff into his house and upon finishing it, I assume you're going to skip the wheel of fortune So as you fall asleep in bed, you're walking through a parking lot and you look down and you see you are carrying a piece of old parchment that is rolled up with a neat little string You like this guy. He's trying to scan the role, but it's not beeping. He looks at you as he chuckles up, this is going to cost you greatly. As you walk out of the grocery store, you step into the sanctuary of a church during a funeral, a young boy with an enormous forehead and the darkest eyes you've seen is walking up to you and tears are streaming down his face as he stares into your eyes. hands.
1638.14 1641.14 speaker2  Yeah. Can I unroll the parchment?
1640.14 1787.84 speaker1  Yeah. As you unroll it, the young boy looks up and he reaches for it and you begin to hear cries throughout the sanctuary you are standing in and as you look around, the congregation is trying to run away, but they are melting into the floor. You look down and you too are melting into the floor. When you look up, the boy has been replaced by Tildy B. Mitchell, who looks down at you with her finger pointed at you like a gun. She disappears and reappears over and over again as you slowly sink into the floor. This is when we would do our dealings with the disorder that you have picked up. So each day, basically we're going to look back at the past day and say, Thomas, did John Lee Pettymore actively choose to avoid any threats or chances to save people? So you don't take any willpower damage. Each day that you do avoid one of those things, the next day you'll take a D6 hit to your willpower when you wake up. And for each day that you continually do that, it doubles or sorry, it doesn't double. It just adds a D6 every time. What does that say? Clark came by last night when no one is at the station. He warned me not to go to the chief's house. He was limping, but he wasn't limping later. What is going on? And where is all the cake? I text him back. I ask him where he is right now. Was he injured at chief's house? No. Okay. I ask him where he is now and I tell him that the cake is safe.
1786.84 1813.60 speaker2  Sounds good. Don't worry about it.
1812.60 1846.44 speaker1  He's super nice. Yeah. I guess. I don't know. He has Coke contacts. So I text him. Yeah. That, that the cake is safe and where is he? Okay. Yeah. Doesn't matter. Six. Nope. It's eight. Yeah. Okay. Seven 30. It's eight o'clock. Doesn't matter.
1845.44 1848.44 speaker2  You ready?
1847.44 1849.44 speaker1  You know, like what time is it?
1848.44 1851.44 speaker2  Is it seven 45?
1850.44 1916.28 speaker1  How stressed should I be? A lot goes into my role play decisions. It's definitely a lot of planning and uh, I like to inhabit a character, you know, not just fly by the cuff of my like a cuff of my seat, the seat of my, okay. The seat of your tight pants. All right, Luke. So your disorder is that you have to actively lie about things to make you sound better. Yes. You didn't do that yesterday. I haven't been doing that. that you continue to not lie to make yourself sound better, it's going to be an extra D six daily. Okay. Do I have to lie?
1915.28 1924.08 speaker2  Okay. That's five. Five willpower. Starting at two.
1923.08 1927.08 speaker1  Yeah.
1926.08 1940.68 speaker2  I die. I lose the will to live.
1935.48 1956.58 speaker1  and that is going to cause a negative 20% to all of your roles for the day. Uh, and I take control whenever I want of your character.
1954.18 1966.58 speaker2  How can I gain willpower back other than sleeping?
1960.08 1994.18 speaker1  And for each upper that you take, it will negate the negative 20% to your roles for one D six hours. a negative 20% without their use. Is there a way to get over that addiction? Yeah. Okay.
1993.18 2005.74 speaker2  Sounds good. Shit. Looks like I'm going to break into the stash today.
2003.94 2009.74 speaker1  but you've wake up feeling like shit. Yeah.
2008.74 2021.74 speaker2  No. I didn't think so. Um, yeah, I probably am going to have to, I'm going to do the only stimulant that I
2016.04 2034.00 speaker1  know is easily available to Keith, which is the cocaine, the mounds of cocaine that we
2030.56 2036.56 speaker2  So I wake up, I guess I'm going to give John a ring. What time is it right now?
2035.00 2038.56 speaker1  Oh, it's like eight in the morning.
2037.56 2049.56 speaker2  Yeah. I want to give John a ring or a text or whatever and say, Hey, can you bring some stimulants
2048.56 2069.76 speaker1  Sounds good. Cool. So yesterday you did actively hurt a few people. Yeah.
2068.76 2074.20 speaker2  times. A lot.
2070.76 2104.24 speaker1  Um, the woman at the hotel motel. And that means that you, when you wake up this morning, don't have to take any willpower damage to begin the day because your disorder is in control of you. So you only actively lose willpower when you wake up. If you are refraining from giving into the power of your disorder. Yep. Right. Okay. So when you wake up, you, uh, I think you are actually at 10 out of 12 willpower points. So you're feeling pretty all right.
2103.24 2105.24 speaker2  I indeed slept.
2104.24 2108.96 speaker1  All right. So, uh, when you get up, didn't sleep all right.
