0	6160	Long time no see, my pack of pups, it's friend of all canines, Wolf the dog, howling at y'all
6160	13720	from 694.2 PTBP, voted contention's number one radio show that you leave on so your dogs
13720	16920	won't feel lonely while you're at work.
16920	21200	Now y'all know we got some words from our listeners who have taken the time to shout
21200	23560	us out on social media.
23560	26960	It's time for Howlin' with Wolf.
26960	33160	Wolf, I'd like to shout out to the lovely police force that we have here in contention.
33160	37920	I appreciate the stellar job they doin' in keeping us, the citizens, safe.
37920	43600	Why, if they weren't such good officers we might have things like busloads of transients
43600	49440	or people dying of blunt force trauma, hell yeah, or even dangerous men on the streets
49440	51520	disguised as police.
51520	56280	I sure am glad that we don't have to worry about anything like that here in contention
56280	59720	because of the work those fine officers put in.
59720	62480	From Kennedy.
62480	68160	Thanks Kennedy for believin' in our local police heroes without even the slightest awareness
68160	69920	of your own surroundings.
69920	76440	Now quick, turn the radio off now before you learn a thing or two, it's time for the news.
76440	82600	The officers implemented an actually decent plan for a sting operation but the FBI was
82600	85800	watching and steppin' in on the whole thing.
85800	92080	Agents Kennedy and McKinley are in town lookin' for a black Nike bag with nothin' in it.
92080	96880	The federal agents have agreed to meet the contention squad tomorrow mornin' December
96880	100120	4th at the police department.
100120	104920	When the party met up at the station to figure out what to do with their illegal seizures,
104920	110360	Drew was uncommonly not at his desk, replaced instead by a note telling them that he went
110360	113440	to the chief's house.
113440	117400	Officers Bishop and Bettymore hauled off the undocumented loot to their individual
117400	123080	residences while Keith went to the chief's house to check on ol' Drew.
123080	128240	Officers Bishop and Bettymore were soon called to the chief's house after it had exploded
128240	134720	leaving the unconscious officer Vigna and Drew Andrews in the cold yard.
134720	140520	That explosion also left behind the burnt bodies of Harold Dorsey, Chief Maggie Cook
140520	147720	and an unkempt man with a bullet hole in his head and his face in a pile of foot meat.
147720	152920	Foot meat, good feet, could eat, would eat.
152920	159560	Sorry my dearest, I just done broke but puttin' me back together is kudzu with no backbone.
170520	197440	I get my hot cocoa and I walk over to my fellow officers, okay guys, can we walk away from
197440	198440	Drew?
198440	199440	Yeah I think we should.
200360	204080	I wanted to talk to like one of the firefighters, was anybody in there, did anybody in there
204080	205080	make it?
205080	206080	No!
206080	207080	That's what I figured.
207080	208440	Keith who was in there besides the chief?
208440	212840	So I knocked on the door and the door just kinda opened up by itself and it wasn't on
212840	213840	fire at this point?
213840	219320	No but I walked in and it smelled like gasoline and the gas from like a stove.
219320	224920	So I walked in and I immediately saw Drew and some guy, whatever that, whoever's ID
224920	227520	I showed you, they were just laying on the ground.
227520	229280	That fake newsman from the city.
229920	234640	And then I looked over and I walked in a little more and I saw Maggie just, her face was all
234640	240880	slashed up and her left foot was missing and I walked in because I could smell the gas
240880	244840	so I walked into the kitchen to turn the burners off before there was an explosion or anything
244840	249360	but as soon as I turned the corner I saw another guy slumped over on the kitchen table with
249360	255040	a fork in his hand and his left foot was missing too and all four burners were on the stove
255120	260800	and there were two feet in a skillet and all the meat had been picked off of them and as
260800	264960	soon as I went off, went over to turn them off I just felt dizzy and I threw up and I
264960	270440	kind of, I like had to fall down and I hit something with my hand and as soon as I hit
270440	275440	something with my hand, something ticked at the front of the house and a flame just started
275440	280480	coming from the line of gasoline and I grabbed the fire extinguisher and I tried to put it
280480	284160	out as best I could but I slipped and fell in my own vomit.
286000	289120	I'm sorry to laugh, it's a difficult time.
289120	295440	I fell in my own vomit and I got up and I was spraying the fire extinguisher and I kind
295440	300680	of had to jump over the bodies to keep spraying the fire and I realized that I didn't know
300680	304600	how much of use that was so I turned around and I knew I couldn't get both the guys so
304600	311120	I grabbed Drew and I just hauled out of there and I think as soon as we got out of the front
311120	316280	the door had exploded and just threw us back and then I was unconscious after that.
316280	319200	When you said you heard a click and then there was fire?
319200	324280	Yeah, when I fell down I hit something with my hand like a wire or a trap or something
324280	325480	to start the fire.
325480	328200	Well, Clock, we know we didn't start the fire.
328200	329200	It was there before us.
329200	330200	It was always burning.
330200	331200	What the fuck?
331200	332200	Well this is horrific.
332200	336160	Eating their feet you said, eating their feet you said.
336160	340200	I didn't see anybody eat the feet but they were cooked and the meat was picked off of
340200	341200	the feet.
341200	343860	Alright, we're going to have to monitor and you don't know what they say.
343860	348680	I think we need to, someone, maybe you should pick through Drew's poop for the next two
348680	350000	days and make sure they don't find their toenails.
350000	355000	It did smell like poop when I walked in there and I don't know if anybody asked Drew if
355000	358720	he pooped himself.
358720	362080	I figured it could have been from that or it could have been, I don't know.
362080	364820	The guy at the table slumped over with the fork.
364820	366000	I didn't get a good look at him.
366000	367000	Nothing about him?
367000	371720	My first instinct was to turn the gas off and turn the fire off before I got exploded.
371720	373720	Luckily I didn't.
373720	374920	Yeah, just in time.
374920	381200	Keith Vigna, roll an intelligence check for me to see if you remember some information.
381200	382200	I don't.
382200	385140	You don't remember some information.
385140	387480	But he does remember other information.
387480	389920	But there's some that I don't.
389920	390920	Damn.
390920	392600	Is the house currently on fire?
392600	396060	No, it's more like embers.
396060	400300	Was this for something that you told me or was this for something that I would have known
400300	401300	if I got...
401300	406460	That was for something that you would have remembered, but not something that I told
406460	407460	you during this.
407460	409460	Cause I was going to be like, maybe I shouldn't have.
409460	410460	Just tell me.
410460	411460	Yeah, no.
411460	415100	I'd like to go talk to the, the chief firefighter here.
415100	416100	Yeah.
416100	417100	Am I speaking to him now?
417100	418100	Yeah, that's me.
418100	419100	Hey, uh, John.
419100	420100	John Peters.
420100	421100	God dammit.
421100	423740	John Lee Pettymore, uh, Contention PD.
423740	424740	Hey John.
424740	425740	Hey.
426420	427780	I've met many times working in a small town.
427780	428780	Of course.
428780	429780	I'm fireman chief.
429780	430780	Yeah.
430780	432380	We, you're fireman chief.
432380	437500	We all respect the hell out of you and the game that, you know, you boys bring, uh, every
437500	442180	year to the, uh, fireman policemen volleyball tournament.
442180	445500	It's always a fierce game of volleyball, but that's why we love it.
445500	446500	Yeah.
446500	447500	So, hey, you got any leads?
447500	450540	Uh, you got any idea where this fire started or how it started?
450540	455660	Well, it looks like there was a lot of gasoline in the house and I think a natural gas was
455660	457800	the thing that really started the fire.
457800	463620	The gasoline definitely helped keep the fire going and made it very difficult for us to
463620	464620	do our jobs.
464620	468740	It's interesting you say both those things because I was unclear while others were telling
468740	472740	the story whether they meant, at first it seemed like they were smelling gasoline and
472740	474380	then they, the burners were on.
474380	480500	So the burners were probably all on as well as many cans of actual gasoline poured over
480500	483860	the entire place and also just sitting around.
483860	484860	Hey man.
484860	485860	Did you get that?
485860	488900	I mean, I know you've been going out for them VO auditions.
488900	489900	I didn't get it.
489900	490900	Yeah.
490900	492820	Oh, they said that I need to be deeper.
492820	493820	Yeah.
493820	494820	You just keep working on that man.
494820	498340	I can try, but I can only go so deep.
498340	499340	Go down.
499340	500340	Meet me down here.
500340	501340	Down.
501340	502340	Meet me down here.
502340	503340	Down.
503340	504340	Meet me down here.
504340	505340	Down.
505340	510160	I walk up and I'm like, what are you guys singing?
510160	512340	I was wondering if we're trying to sing a tune of justice.
512340	515620	I don't know who that other guy in there was.
515620	518300	How badly are, is the bones burnt?
518300	519920	Oh, they're very burnt.
519920	523480	But there's a way to get some DNA out of those bones, huh?
523480	525680	That's more our, just that's our department.
525680	526680	I look at the bones.
526680	528940	I say, we can get some DNA out of those bones.
528940	530580	Do we have three bodies in there?
530580	531580	Yes.
531580	532580	Three bodies in the house.
532580	533580	Oh, okay.
533580	535580	I was thinking the other guy got out or something.
535580	536580	I didn't think.
536580	537580	No, there was, there was the reporter.
537580	543860	Drew, Maggie, and the guy with the fork with the missing foot and Maggie and the guy that
543860	546460	I don't know were the only two with their feet cut off.
546460	549380	One foot cut off.
549380	551580	Dorsey was just unconscious.
551580	555800	I assume that Maggie and her foot cut off and the guy that she was with foot cut off
555800	560940	were there when they walked in, but that guy did have a fork so he could have been eating
560940	564140	his own foot and Maggie's foot.
564140	565140	Gross.
565140	567700	We should be able to match their dental records.
567700	568700	Awesome.
568700	571860	Really led the fire department's forensics.
571860	576140	You guys should be able to match their dental records.
576140	578580	Someone should be able to match their dental records.
578580	582500	Hey, can't, hey man, you know, I know it's your dream and everything.
582500	584620	Can you talk to us like a person?
584620	585940	We lost our chief tonight.
585940	587420	There's two more dead.
587420	589580	Can you be real with me, Carl?
589580	593860	Fucking just talk to me like, like Carl we all went to high school with.
593900	596980	I am sorry for your loss.
596980	597980	Oh, God damn it.
597980	601580	Who's the best dentist in contention?
601580	605140	Who's the only dentist in contention?
605140	606140	You mean for the dental records?
606140	607140	Dr. Teeth?
607140	608140	Yeah, for the dental records.
608140	609140	Is that how that works?
609140	610140	I don't think it is.
610140	611140	No.
611140	612140	Well, actually, probably.
612140	613140	Yeah, it probably is.
613140	614140	You have to get him from a dentist.
614140	615140	He's lying.
615140	616140	You've got to find him at the dentist.
616140	619140	Yeah, I mean, but for real though, how else would we do it in a small town like this?
619140	620140	We're good cops.
620140	621140	I'm a cop.
621140	623020	Who is the dentist in contention?
623020	624820	It would be, what's a good dentist name?
624820	625820	Dr. Millare.
625820	626820	Yeah, that's it.
626820	627820	Dr. Millare.
627820	628820	Yeah, Dr. Millare.
628820	633820	When we came by here yesterday, I don't remember.
633820	634820	Chief's Cruiser wasn't here.
634820	636300	That's what I was going to get at.
636300	637660	Was the Chief's Cruiser even here?
637660	638660	No, no, no.
638660	639660	She wasn't.
639660	640660	Can I go through her cruiser?
640660	641660	Good call.
641660	644980	And I'm going to go through Drew's car, even though he's standing right over there.
644980	648300	Yeah, give me just a second.
648300	650300	I have to go pee.
650300	651300	Cool.
651300	657860	Okay, so there was a bullet hole in his head.
657860	659180	Yeah, I missed that part.
659180	661140	He was slumped over a plate of meat.
661140	662140	Foot meat?
662140	666660	Looking back now on it, I assume foot meat and both feet were in the skillet with meat
666660	667660	picked off of them.
667660	671260	Do you remember seeing a bunch of blood in like the kitchen or anything?
671260	673260	Like were the floors covered in blood?
673260	678660	From like the stab wounds, all over Maggie's face was blood and then from leaking out of
678660	679660	their feet.
680260	683900	Because if you had cooking feet and then also a foot miss and I just wondered if he was
683900	685220	going back and forth or not.
685220	689580	Yeah, well from what I could see, like what I slipped on was my own vomit and a bunch
689580	690660	of puke.
690660	692940	I mean a bunch of blood.
692940	693940	And a bunch of puke.
693940	694940	And your own puke.
694940	695940	And my own puke.
695940	696940	Oh god.
696940	699460	There's a lot of bodily fluids in this scene.
699460	701220	Hey Zach, congratulations.
701220	706220	This is the first time since we've been roleplaying where I'm actually like legitimately grossed
706220	707220	out and horrified.
707220	708220	Yay!
708740	713140	Right when we walked up and you said it was eating their feet, I was like, oh fuck no.
713140	714140	Yeah.
714140	720300	Dude, also this scene reminds me of that John Mulaney joke where he talks about, ew, gross,
720300	723300	clean it up.
723300	725540	There's hair, blood, and semen everywhere.
725540	726540	Gross.
726540	727540	Clean it up.
727540	731420	Do you guys want to just jerk each other off for the next 20 minutes?
731420	732740	Yeah, let's do that.
732740	733740	We could play too.
733740	734740	That'd be fine.
734740	735740	Same difference.
735740	736740	I can do one thing.
736740	738620	Do we go clockwise or counterclockwise?
738620	739620	What if we alternate?
739620	741140	Like a couple pumps here.
741140	742140	Dude.
742140	743140	That doesn't work.
743140	744140	Yeah, he gets.
744140	745140	Let's pair off.
745140	746140	I call Luke.
746140	747140	No, no, no.
747140	748140	I'm sitting by Luke.
748140	749140	Guys.
749140	750140	Okay.
750140	752340	We were talking about the firefighter and then what?
752340	753580	Oh, the dental records.
753580	755780	Yeah, we were talking about how.
755780	759900	You guys need to go to a vintage, you guys realize you need to go talk to the dentist
759900	760900	maybe.
760900	761900	Dr. Millar.
761900	762900	Dr. Millar.
762900	763900	Dr. Millar.
763900	764900	Dr. Millar.
764900	765900	Dr. Millar.
766060	767060	Real talk though.
767060	768060	We got to go to bed.
768060	769060	Like it's.
769060	770060	Yeah.
770060	771060	Yeah.
771060	772060	I was, I was trying to.
772060	773060	Yeah.
773060	774060	Also the doctor is not going to be, he's going to be asleep right now.
774060	775060	I don't know about you guys, but I'm fine.
775060	776060	Yeah.
776060	779620	So we should probably go to sleep and then we can talk to Dr. Millar after we deal with
779620	780620	the FBI.
780620	785740	I really wanted to role play a guy in cocaine, but the situation was simply too somber.
785740	789380	I didn't even think about that.
789380	794100	But like also like it instantly, like just hearing about it made me so bummed like sober
794100	795900	you up in real life.
795900	797140	I've been treated.
797140	800780	I'm not really, I didn't take any damage or anything that I got out of there.
800780	802420	I was just kind of in shock for a minute.
802420	806040	So yeah, maybe the like, uh, your eyebrows smell weird.
806040	810260	Maybe I don't have eyebrows anymore.
810260	812460	I don't have eyebrows anymore.
812460	813460	False eyebrows.
813460	815180	Strong character choice.
815180	819980	As Keith Vigna, I would love to go to my bed and fall asleep.
819980	820980	Yeah.
820980	821980	It seems good.
821980	822980	Same.
822980	823980	I'm going to go home.
824860	828340	Do a search on the charred remains of the chief's house.
828340	830740	And also were you, you tried to get into her car.
830740	831740	You couldn't.
831740	832740	Oh, that's where we left off.
832740	833740	Yep.
833740	834740	Good one.
834740	835740	Good.
835740	836740	Boom.
836740	840500	Clark, you go and check the chief's cruiser and it is clean.
840500	842420	There is nothing inside of it.
842420	844460	Not even a steering wheel or seats.
844460	846820	Not even a steering wheel or seats.
846820	848420	No, there are those things.
848420	854020	There is however, no detritus or any other information.
854020	855440	Can I look in the glove box?
855440	857000	You look in the glove box.
857000	858000	It is empty.
858000	859000	Weirdly enough.
859000	860500	Does she have a dash cam?
860500	864780	She has a dash cam on the cruiser and it has been unhooked.
864780	868940	I want to open up the computer that all cop cars have.
868940	870740	Yes, you do that.
870740	876820	Can I get any information from that voice comes over the computer.
876820	877820	Hello computer.
878820	879820	State your query.
879820	881860	Where was this car earlier today?
881860	883740	Examining records.
883740	886820	It was at the mill on the other side of the city.
886820	889580	This car was at the mill on the other side of the city.
889580	891260	How long was it there cop computer?
891260	893420	Since the evening of December 1st.
893420	896180	Three days since the evening of December 1st.
896180	897180	Is that right?
897180	898180	Three days.
898180	899180	That's right.
899180	901820	I mean, it's like the evening of December.
901820	906020	It's like two, two and a bit, two days and a couple hours.
906020	908860	You know, like two and a few.
908860	911020	Is what the computer says back to you.
911020	912020	Excellent.
912020	913020	Thank you cop computer.
913020	914020	Cop net.
914020	915020	Cop net.
915020	916020	Thank you cop net.
916020	919020	You're welcome officer Bishop.
919020	924260	Okay.
924260	925260	What is love?
925260	926260	Officer Bishop.
926260	929260	I close it.
929260	933060	Clark doesn't know.
933060	936340	Clark starts to weep.
936340	937340	I go back to you guys.
937340	938540	I'm going home to go to sleep.
938540	953060	I just, I just talked to the cop net and, uh, what, what is cop net?
953060	955820	You know, the, uh, the computer we talked to in our cars.
955820	957020	Clark, what are you talking?
957020	959740	Wait, we have a computer in our cars, buddy.
959740	960740	I think you need some rest.
960740	962620	I'm just so sleepy.
963180	964180	You know, cop net.
964180	965180	No, I don't.
965180	967700	He said he sounds like this cop, cop net.
967700	971460	Turns out that Maggie's car has been up at the mill for the last couple of days.
971460	976100	In fact, I think it's where she went after she left the station after I gave her her
976100	977100	present.
977100	978100	Yeah.
978100	979100	This was all your fault.
979100	980100	Hmm.
980100	981100	Forget about that.
981100	982100	What's at the mill.
982100	983100	I don't know.
983100	984100	I think that's something we need to investigate tomorrow.
984100	985100	Tomorrow.
985100	986100	Some grist.
986100	989820	I opened my computer up, look at it and I'm like, wow, I guess I do have computer in here.
989820	992020	I shut it and I drive home.
992020	993020	I'm driving home too.
993020	994020	Okay.
994020	995020	If you guys could both leave.
1005020	1007020	Oh, glad I got that one out of the way.
1007020	1008020	99.
1008020	1009020	95.
1009020	1010020	Woo.
1010020	1011020	That's a bad roll.
1011020	1012020	It's a bad roll.
1012020	1013020	Hey, I'd like to search that house.
1013020	1014020	Cool.
1014020	1016060	And you are super hopped up currently.
1016100	1025540	So you decide to grab, I see John going to the back of his car and pulling out a bunch
1025540	1033700	of evidence bags and then carrying them toward the burning embers of this house to collect
1033700	1035540	evidence in these bags.
1035540	1037260	Do you?
1037260	1039260	That's what I'm picturing currently.
1039260	1040260	Okay.
1040260	1041260	What do you picture?
1041460	1045700	I'm always picturing more just a stroll through the house, you know, through the wreckage
1045700	1048380	to try to find anything of significance.
1048380	1053820	This was a brick home and the exterior walls are still in place.
1053820	1054820	Sure.
1054820	1055820	Mostly.
1055820	1062100	The explosion took out a lot of the brick from the back of the house where the explosion
1062100	1069860	seems to have come from and the roof has been blown off and the insides are completely melted
1069860	1074820	and charred, but the structure itself still slightly stands.
1074820	1078480	The structure itself still slightly stands.
1078480	1079480	One thing for sure.
1079480	1080480	This was a house.
1080480	1081480	Nailed it.
1081480	1083380	You can never know if this house was a home.
1083380	1087340	What kind of evidence are you wanting to acquire?
1087340	1090400	I was mostly just hoping to do a search roll.
1090400	1092980	Go ahead and roll that search roll for me.
1092980	1093980	Eight.
1093980	1094980	Zero eight?
1094980	1095980	Yep.
1095980	1096980	All right.
1096980	1097980	Awesome.
1097980	1098980	All right.
1098980	1099980	Awesome.
1099980	1106460	So as you go through, you can collect the burnt remains of three bodies.
1106460	1109700	I bet we'd have some coroners for that.
1109700	1113020	Seems like a medical examiner.
1113020	1116740	I don't know if they'd just let me, even as a cop, if they'd just let me be here on my
1116740	1119660	own poking around like bagging up bodies.
1119660	1124720	The county coroner is walking with you as you go through it all.
1124720	1126060	What is their name?
1126060	1127060	Her name is Sheila.
1127140	1128140	Is she Australian?
1128140	1129140	Yeah.
1129140	1131060	I mean, she hates this.
1131060	1132060	She's not happy.
1132060	1134260	She got called at like two in the morning.
1134260	1138420	Hey, come to contention, this town that you have to drive like 45 minutes to.
1138420	1139420	Oh, she's from the city?
1139420	1140420	Yeah.
1140420	1141420	Yeah.
1141420	1142420	That makes sense.
1142420	1144980	She booked her way over here and she's dreary.
1144980	1152460	She's weary eyed and upset and helping you collect the evidence of these three charred
1152460	1154020	remains of bodies.
1154020	1155500	Sheila, in your...
1155500	1156500	Sorry.
1156940	1160020	In your medical opinion, how would you say these folks died?
1160020	1161020	Burned.
1161020	1166340	I don't want to be inappropriate like with you, but the Australian accent is truly beautiful.
1166340	1167780	Your husband must be a lucky man.
1167780	1168780	He is.
1168780	1169780	All right.
1169780	1170780	You want to help me pick up these bones?
1170780	1173140	Yes.
1173140	1174860	She begins collecting bones.
1174860	1175860	Okay.
1175860	1176860	All right.
1176860	1177860	Simply breathtaking.
1177860	1178860	Help.
1178860	1179860	There's more over here.
1179860	1180860	Okay.
1180860	1183700	I think you got that then there Sheila.
1183700	1187180	I don't think you're really Australian.
1187180	1194220	You can actually find the pistol that was in the hand of the man in the kitchen.
1194220	1195220	Okay.
1195220	1196220	I bagged that up.
1196220	1199980	And you can find the knife that was in the hand of Chief Maggie Cook.
1199980	1201380	The knife was in her hand.
1201380	1204780	She had a large chef's knife in her left hand.
1204780	1205780	Okay.
1205780	1210660	Well, basically I want to see if that matches the stab wounds on her face.
1210660	1211660	Okay.
1211660	1220100	And you can also find lots of gas cans, metal gas cans are strewn.
1220100	1221700	There are probably seven of them.
1221700	1222700	Okay.
1222700	1225900	The knife, well, roll forensics for me.
1225900	1229460	I mean, I would like to, I guess, send that off, but I can, I'll do it.
1229460	1230460	For now.
1230460	1231460	I'll just hold it up to the-
1231460	1232460	Yep.
1232460	1233460	That's hold it up to the holes.
1233460	1236260	To the holes in the skull.
1236260	1237580	That's a, wow.
1237580	1238580	That's a crit fail.
1238580	1239580	All right.
1239580	1242100	What does a crit fail on a forensics test look like?
1242100	1250540	You slip and you shove the knife into the burnt skull of Chief Maggie Cook and you accidentally
1250540	1256780	rifle around and a lot of her face and skull disintegrate onto itself.
1256780	1257780	Oh shit.
1257780	1263700	So you might not be able to get super accurate results back from that.
1263700	1268700	And Sheila says, what are you doing over there?
1268700	1272180	I didn't want to do that.
1272180	1280740	Now you know how Keith fucks up all the rolls, I just have you one on one.
1280740	1281740	I can make whatever-
1281740	1285420	The other thing though is that I did not want to wiggle the knife around in her skull, can
1285420	1286420	we?
1286420	1290660	Like, that's not what I'm trying to do here.
1290660	1292740	That was funny, but can we wreck on that?
1292740	1296980	I'll take every crit failure as strongly as I possibly can.
1296980	1305140	I know that, but it just seems disrespectful to destroy the Chief's face.
1305140	1307780	That's not what I was about.
1307780	1308980	Go ahead and roll sanity for me.
1308980	1311740	Is this a knife?
1311740	1316100	While poking through all this stuff and then severely fucking up the corpse of your former
1316100	1317100	boss.
1317100	1321980	Oh, God damn it, that's a 99.
1321980	1322980	That's a crit fail.
1322980	1323980	Okay, awesome.
1323980	1329620	Go ahead and lose three sanity automatically, which puts you at 40.
1329620	1330620	Yes.
1330620	1333340	Is there anything else that you wanted to do?
1333340	1335220	No, I think I've done enough here.
1335220	1336220	Couldn't agree more.
1336220	1339020	So go ahead and roll alertness for me real quick.
1339020	1340020	95.
1340020	1341620	On a 100.
1341620	1342620	So congratulations.
1342620	1344340	No, it's on a 16.
1344340	1348540	Okay, you don't notice the thing that you would have noticed?
1348540	1351860	Your search check was for inside the house, which you succeeded on, so you got everything
1351860	1357380	inside the house, but the alertness check was for something that's totally fair.
1357380	1358380	Very different.
1358380	1359380	Okay.
1359380	1362500	Wish I hadn't destroyed the Chief's face.
1362500	1364940	I bet it'll be fine.
1364940	1366620	That image is going to stay with me.
1366620	1370780	Just digging around in there as it completely falls apart.
1370780	1373060	Okay, so I don't know.
1373060	1376100	I mean, yeah, I'll go home and put that stuff away.
1376340	1382500	Okay, so you finish putting everything into the house and get the trailer that you used
1382500	1384900	ready to take back in the morning.
1384900	1386820	And then you go inside and...
1386820	1392220	Yeah, I'm going to jack off and, I don't know, maybe throw on some ancient aliens.
1392220	1394940	That should help get you to sleep.
1394940	1397420	So you're not going to be able to fall asleep for too long tonight.
1397420	1402960	In fact, I'm going to have you roll power in order to get even a decent night's rest.
1402960	1404860	So roll against your POW.
1405420	1406420	Crit success.
1406420	1407420	Nice.
1407420	1412100	Then you're going to be able to force your cocaine-addled mind right to sleep.
1412100	1414420	The Pennymores are famously clear of mind.
1423460	1425460	You're laying in bed.
1427100	1428100	Your eyes close.
1428100	1429100	Zach, I'm right here.
1429100	1430100	Zach, no, no, no.
1430100	1431100	I'm right here.
1431100	1432100	Wake up, buddy.
1432100	1433100	I'm right here.
1433340	1434860	Not for the podcast, that's for us.
1434860	1435860	That was a dumb joke.
1435860	1437860	You're trying to do something serious instead of mood.
1437860	1439740	And I was just like, so anyway.
1439740	1440740	You come to...
1440740	1441740	Edit point.
1444100	1450020	You come to and the sky is dark, but the ground begins to give light to the world.
1450020	1456900	You see a man in the distance with his head and hands in stocks that sit on an inky black
1456900	1458520	stage.
1458520	1463340	As you walk toward this man, the ground becomes wider and wider like a screen's brightness
1463340	1466620	level being gradually turned up.
1466620	1472080	You hear a holler from behind you and when you turn around, you see your mother.
1472080	1477040	She looks like she did when she was about your age and she is crying.
1477040	1485320	She looks past you and a door appears in between you, but you can hear her say, I'm so sorry.
1485320	1486760	He's just so beautiful.
1486760	1488140	You don't have to do this.
1488140	1489260	We can leave.
1489260	1490860	We can run.
1490860	1496700	The door floats up into the sky and sitting behind it is that trunk.
1496700	1501300	You locked up in the police department with the woman's split head atop the black putrid
1501300	1502980	hacked up anatomy.
1502980	1508700	You turn around and you are face to face with the man in the stocks, John Peters, his forehead
1508700	1513400	burned and peeling with the word fool desperate.
1513400	1519760	His eyes widen and he whispers, please, it's coming.
1519760	1521920	They cannot stop it.
1521920	1524620	They are playing the roles of greater men.
1524620	1526800	You have to save everyone.
1526800	1529640	It is coming.
1529640	1531600	What's coming, John, what's coming?
1531600	1536000	You hear a rumble in the distance as you wake up in bed.
1536000	1538880	Oh, another good night's sleep.
1538880	1541340	You know, I never, I never remember my dreams.
1541340	1544540	You actually get a D four back on willpower.
1544540	1548460	That's a two hello world.
1548460	1553620	And uh, you're heading to the station to meet up with, um, your partners as well as the
1553620	1562940	FBI.
1562940	1570520	Joe Clark makes it back to his home where he is almost finished unloading all the stuff
1570520	1575540	into his house and upon finishing it, I assume you're going to skip the wheel of fortune
1575540	1577280	tonight and go straight to bed.
1577280	1579160	Probably no, no dinner even.
1579160	1587120	So as you fall asleep in bed, you're walking through a parking lot and you look down and
1587120	1593220	you see you are carrying a piece of old parchment that is rolled up with a neat little string
1593220	1595160	tied tightly around it.
1595160	1600060	Looking up, you hand it to the cashier of your local grocery store.
1600060	1601220	You like this guy.
1601220	1604380	He's trying to scan the role, but it's not beeping.
1604380	1608900	He looks at you as he chuckles up, this is going to cost you greatly.
1608900	1613180	As you walk out of the grocery store, you step into the sanctuary of a church during
1613180	1621020	a funeral, a young boy with an enormous forehead and the darkest eyes you've seen is walking
1621020	1627740	up to you and tears are streaming down his face as he stares into your eyes.
1627740	1636140	You hear a small voice inside you that says, please, sir, as the crying boy holds out his
1636140	1637140	hands.
1637140	1638140	Do I still have the parchment?
1638140	1639140	Yeah.
1639140	1640140	Can I unroll the parchment?
1640140	1641140	Yeah.
1641140	1646180	As you unroll it, the young boy looks up and he reaches for it and you begin to hear cries
1646180	1651200	throughout the sanctuary you are standing in and as you look around, the congregation
1651200	1655980	is trying to run away, but they are melting into the floor.
1655980	1659780	You look down and you too are melting into the floor.
1659780	1665300	When you look up, the boy has been replaced by Tildy B. Mitchell, who looks down at you
1665300	1668420	with her finger pointed at you like a gun.
1668420	1676260	She disappears and reappears over and over again as you slowly sink into the floor.
1676260	1684080	As your eyes look to the ceiling of the chapel, you hear a voice inside you say, let go.
1684080	1687320	As you wake up in bed.
1687320	1690840	In the dream, I never got a good look at the parchment as I was unrolling it.
1690840	1691840	Okay.
1691840	1692840	Okay.
1692840	1705620	So John, when you wake up, I'm going to have you normally on each day.
1705620	1713080	This is when we would do our dealings with the disorder that you have picked up.
1713080	1720520	So each day, basically we're going to look back at the past day and say, Thomas, did
1720520	1726880	John Lee Pettymore actively choose to avoid any threats or chances to save people?
1726880	1727880	And you didn't.
1727880	1730320	So you don't take any willpower damage.
1730320	1736200	Each day that you do avoid one of those things, the next day you'll take a D6 hit to your
1736200	1738080	willpower when you wake up.
1738080	1742600	And for each day that you continually do that, it doubles or sorry, it doesn't double.
1742600	1744880	It just adds a D6 every time.
1744880	1752140	So as long as you continue to not avoid threats or chances to save people, you'll be fine.
1752140	1759080	When John wakes up, however, he has a text from Drew.
1759080	1760700	What does that say?
1760700	1763440	Text from Drew.
1763440	1765900	Clark came by last night when no one is at the station.
1765900	1768040	He warned me not to go to the chief's house.
1768040	1770240	He was limping, but he wasn't limping later.
1770240	1771360	What is going on?
1771360	1773800	And where is all the cake?
1773800	1775640	I text him back.
1775640	1777720	I ask him where he is right now.
1777720	1779780	Did he go to the hospital after?
1779780	1781480	Was he injured at chief's house?
1781480	1782480	No.
1782480	1783480	Okay.
1783480	1785840	I ask him where he is now and I tell him that the cake is safe.
1785840	1786840	All right.
1786840	1787840	Sounds good.
1787840	1792740	He'll send you a text back as you're getting ready and say, I'm already at the station.
1792740	1798840	If we were really organizing like a multimillion dollar drug deal, like Drew is the sweet,
1798840	1803320	like what a sweet way to address that at the end of a text, like, Hey, by the way,
1803320	1805160	where's all the drugs?
1805160	1809400	No, Hey, don't, I, you know, I know you got a lot on your plate.
1809400	1810400	Don't worry about it.
1810400	1812600	But by the way, uh, where's all the cake?
1812600	1813600	He's super nice.
1813600	1814600	He is.
1814600	1815600	Yeah.
1815600	1816600	I guess.
1816600	1817600	I don't know.
1817600	1818600	He has Coke contacts.
1818600	1819600	He can't.
1819600	1820600	Maybe.
1820600	1821840	Maybe.
1821840	1822840	So I text him.
1822840	1823840	Yeah.
1823840	1826680	That, that the cake is safe and where is he?
1826680	1827680	Okay.
1827680	1828680	Yeah.
1828680	1831440	He'll, he'll respond and tell you that he's already at the station.
1831440	1832440	What time is it?
1832440	1833440	Eight.
1833440	1834440	Sure.
1834440	1835440	Seven.
1835440	1836440	Doesn't matter.
1836440	1837440	Six.
1837440	1838440	Nope.
1838440	1839440	It's eight.
1839440	1840440	Yeah.
1840440	1841440	Okay.
1841440	1842440	Seven 30.
1842440	1843440	It's eight o'clock.
1843440	1844440	Okay.
1844440	1845440	Doesn't matter.
1845440	1846440	You ready?
1846440	1847440	It's just a, it's really essential for me to get into that head space.
1847440	1848440	You know, like what time is it?
1848440	1849440	Is it seven 45?
1849440	1850440	Is it eight, eight 15?
1850440	1851440	How stressed should I be?
1851440	1854440	I got to think about the light, how it's acting up.
1854440	1856480	A lot goes into my role play decisions.
1856480	1857480	I appreciate that.
1858280	1860280	Oh, absolutely.
1860280	1867880	It's definitely a lot of planning and uh, I like to inhabit a character, you know, not
1867880	1872480	just fly by the cuff of my like a cuff of my seat, the seat of my, okay.
1872480	1874480	The seat of your tight pants.
1874480	1875480	Yeah.
1875480	1878480	Let's not include any of this.
1888480	1889480	All right, Luke.
1889480	1897080	So your disorder is that you have to actively lie about things to make you sound better.
1897080	1898080	Yes.
1898080	1899080	You didn't do that yesterday.
1899080	1900080	I haven't been doing that.
1900080	1906580	Uh, so you're going to start off today with one D six willpower damage and for each day
1906580	1911280	that you continue to not lie to make yourself sound better, it's going to be an extra D
1911280	1912280	six daily.
1912280	1913280	Okay.
1913280	1914280	Do I have to lie?
1914280	1915280	Yeah.
1915280	1916280	Okay.
1917080	1918080	That's five.
1918080	1919080	Five willpower.
1919080	1920080	Okay.
1920080	1921080	So that brings me down.
1921080	1923080	Starting at two.
1923080	1924080	Yeah.
1924080	1926080	What happens if I go to zero?
1926080	1927080	I die.
1927080	1928880	I lose the will to live.
1928880	1935480	So at one or two willpower, we're going to learn now you are having an emotional breakdown
1935480	1940680	and that is going to cause a negative 20% to all of your roles for the day.
1940680	1941680	Yeah.
1941680	1944980	Oh, that's just what Keith needs.
1944980	1948780	When you hit zero, uh, no tests can succeed.
1948780	1953180	Uh, and I take control whenever I want of your character.
1953180	1954180	Okay.
1954180	1956580	How can I gain willpower back other than sleeping?
1956580	1960080	You can do stimulants to focus.
1960080	1966580	And for each upper that you take, it will negate the negative 20% to your roles for
1966580	1968320	one D six hours.
1968320	1971980	And what's the negative consequences of that?
1971980	1978580	Well, if you use stimulants too often, they become addictive and your body will be at
1978580	1980980	a negative 20% without their use.
1980980	1983580	Is there a way to get over that addiction?
1983580	1984580	Yeah.
1984580	1985580	Rehab.
1985580	1989280	How long in game is that?
1989280	1992180	We will get there if we get there.
1992180	1993180	Okay.
1993180	1994180	Sounds good.
1994180	1995180	Shit.
1995180	1998740	Looks like I'm going to break into the stash today.
1998740	2003940	So do you want to, uh, I mean, do you want to try to find anything to make yourself feel,
2003940	2005740	but you've wake up feeling like shit.
2005740	2006740	Yeah.
2006740	2008740	I mean, would coffee count?
2008740	2009740	No.
2009740	2011740	I didn't think so.
2011740	2016040	Um, yeah, I probably am going to have to, I'm going to do the only stimulant that I
2016040	2021740	know is easily available to Keith, which is the cocaine, the mounds of cocaine that we
2021740	2022740	have.
2022740	2023740	Yes.
2023740	2025540	And it is all out at, uh, John's house.
2025540	2027960	It is all out at John's house.
2027960	2029560	He might have some on him.
2029560	2030560	Who knows?
2030560	2034000	So I wake up, I guess I'm going to give John a ring.
2034000	2035000	What time is it right now?
2035000	2036560	Oh, it's like eight in the morning.
2036560	2037560	Okay.
2037560	2038560	Yeah.
2038560	2044560	I want to give John a ring or a text or whatever and say, Hey, can you bring some stimulants
2044560	2046560	with you?
2046560	2047560	Okay.
2047560	2048560	Okay.
2048560	2049560	Sounds good.
2049560	2057560	Cool.
2057560	2063160	So yesterday you did actively hurt a few people.
2063160	2064160	Yeah.
2064160	2068760	I believe you shot the woman in the, in the hand at least once and then in her chest multiple
2068760	2069760	times.
2069760	2070760	A lot.
2070760	2074200	Um, the woman at the hotel motel.
2074200	2078960	And that means that you, when you wake up this morning, don't have to take any willpower
2078960	2084760	damage to begin the day because your disorder is in control of you.
2084760	2089160	So you only actively lose willpower when you wake up.
2089160	2093240	If you are refraining from giving into the power of your disorder.
2093240	2094240	Yep.
2094240	2095240	Right.
2095240	2096240	Okay.
2096240	2101360	So when you wake up, you, uh, I think you are actually at 10 out of 12 willpower points.
2101360	2103240	So you're feeling pretty all right.
2103240	2104240	I indeed slept.
2104240	2105240	All right.
2105240	2108960	So, uh, when you get up, didn't sleep all right.
2144760	2145760	Yeah.
2145760	2145760
