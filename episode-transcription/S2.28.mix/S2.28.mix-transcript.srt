1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Shhh, listen, do y'all hear that?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,880
The skittering of many greasy limbs?

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:16,180
It's almost like dozens of giant fingers gently slipping around on a bowling lane, and yet

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,180
so fast.

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:24,640
I'm sure it's nothing, but listen here, what ain't nothing is me saying howdy and hello

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,380
and welcome to 694.2 PTBP.

7
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:38,120
It is I, the one, the only, probably, DJ Wolf the dog, and if this many-limbed being doesn't

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,620
snatch me up, I think we got a banger of a show for y'all.

9
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:50,740
I howl, you howl, we all howl for howlin' with Wolf, and this particular howlin' with

10
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:57,740
Wolf is from Sneaky Whisper, and they have requested their location to be broadcast as

11
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,240
the internet.

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:05,740
Sneaky Whisper from the internet tweeted about the show and tagged at pretending pod, a thing

13
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,440
that internet folks should do.

14
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,400
Are you on the internet, dear listener?

15
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,960
You could also tweet about the show, whoa.

16
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,440
Sneaky Whisper writes, Dear Wolf, I was able to break through the interdimensional firewall

17
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,680
to get you this limited character message.

18
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,560
I've been stuck in this dimension they call cyberspace and heard your dimension may be

19
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,000
having a similar polymorphic virus problem as mine.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Whatever you do, do not feed them the 0x dead beef, and for the rest of your radio listeners,

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,920
the cow has red spots, the cat broke the fiddle, and the spoon did not go willingly with the

22
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,920
dish.

23
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,720
Be excellent to each other out there in meatspace, meatspace you say?

24
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:06,440
Now I've been all over the place exploring different space time things or whatever, but

25
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,200
I ain't never been to a meatspace.

26
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,300
Damn, I need to book me a space B&B in this meatspace dimension.

27
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,480
If you want to write up something for your vigilant Wolf to howl, tag at pretending pod

28
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,520
on the Instagram or the Twitter, or tag pretending to be people on the Facebook.

29
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,760
Or you can do us a favor and write up a five star review on the podcast app of your choice

30
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,280
and holler at me about it so I know.

31
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,480
And by the by, fuck Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg too.

32
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,600
Now for some links.

33
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,920
Bonus content on Patreon, merch at the merch store.

34
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:56,220
Picks of the boys on Instagram, retweets of Luke's Twitter on Twitter, harsh criticisms

35
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:04,880
of early 2000s collectible memorabilia on Facebook, horny shipping on Discord, lost

36
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:14,340
Redditors on the subreddit, tracks from the PTBPOST on YouTube, and places to jam and

37
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,480
support Alter Girl.

38
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,520
Do you know where all these links are?

39
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,560
You do?

40
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,680
Then fucking get in there and get clicky with it.

41
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:31,000
Then pull a switch and come on down to the Wicky Wicky Wild Wild West and slap a rock

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,560
Big Willy style and I don't know man.

43
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,180
This run isn't super fresh, but fuck Will Smith and keep my wife's links in your motherfucking

44
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:47,680
show notes.

45
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,180
Bienvenidos a venus.

46
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,600
Last time, Julius Summers told Cal and Beck everything.

47
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,660
He gave them the full rundown including a flashback to his high school days.

48
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,100
And then he realized Stevie and Jeremy were there too.

49
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,060
Also Joe made an incredible DMX joke.

50
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,860
Taking us now to the first day of the rest of the can crew's lives.

51
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,620
Now that they know what they know and it's not what they thought.

52
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:24,740
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

53
00:04:39,060 --> 00:05:02,940
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.

54
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,060
What kind of world are we living in?

55
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,780
What kind of world are we living in?

56
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,780
Us or you?

57
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,780
You.

58
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,780
Got em.

59
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,780
Dude.

60
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,940
Your reality is not the same as my reality.

61
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,060
I reject your reality and substitute my own.

62
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,900
I watched a skater darkly last night.

63
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,940
So.

64
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:31,380
I watched the Mario movie last night and dude it opened my eyes.

65
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,420
Okay, what's the deal with the Mario movie being unwoke?

66
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,420
Or like anti-woke?

67
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,420
What?

68
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:42,540
I just heard it was actually funny.

69
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:48,300
Same thing right?

70
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,300
I don't know.

71
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,940
I just watched it yesterday and there's nothing that sticks out.

72
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,820
Did you look it up on Focus on the Family?

73
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,940
No I did not.

74
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,940
What does it get?

75
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,940
Do you know what that means?

76
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,940
Yes.

77
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,940
Do you remember that?

78
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,940
Did you guys have that?

79
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,980
I never had it but it's occasionally an internet stir every now and then.

80
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:12,500
I mean it was every movie that came out my mom would look up on that website.

81
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,900
Is it the one that listed every single, it would be an R-rated movie and the list would

82
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:25,540
be a hundred things and it's like they said the F word, they said damn, they showed someone's

83
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,540
midriff.

84
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:32,180
Sometimes they would get into really, I don't know who's writing some of these, but really

85
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:38,660
hot and heavy descriptions of what went down in the film and your boy would just get going

86
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,660
off the line, you know?

87
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,660
Oh no, little Zach can't see this, oh my.

88
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,640
I read Super- Nothing gets me going like stuff that my son

89
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,640
shouldn't see.

90
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,300
Hey you said what kind of world are you living in?

91
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,700
Is there anything else you wanted to say about that Luke?

92
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,780
Well if you have listened to this podcast you might be familiar with the band Dragon

93
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,500
in 3 and Zach was just giving us a little sample.

94
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:11,660
They got new music, depending on when this comes out their new music is out or their

95
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:20,420
new music is so close to coming out, so go on Spotify or whatever streaming app that

96
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,500
you use, go to band camp and buy the new Dragon in 3 album.

97
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,140
They have two singles out right now and they're very good.

98
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,540
I just got the new shirt, it rips, it just came in the mail, it's really rad.

99
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,540
Oh that's a bummer.

100
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,540
It rips.

101
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,540
It rips.

102
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,540
It rips.

103
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,540
Yeah, it's a shitty shirt.

104
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,860
It's a bad shirt, but all the best shirts are bad shirts.

105
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:44,980
Go listen to that and buy their stuff and then there's the other bands too.

106
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,980
Go buy so much stuff.

107
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,980
There's other bands.

108
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,980
There are other bands.

109
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,700
Yeah, support what you like or don't.

110
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,760
Yeah, there's local music around you.

111
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,260
Don't support musicians, support podcasters.

112
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,220
I've heard that it's like, there's loco music around me dude.

113
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:04,980
There's loco music out there and they don't put out music but like once a year and we're

114
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,340
giving you content every other week here pretending to be people.

115
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,740
Patreon.com slash pretending pod.

116
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,740
We do it.

117
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,740
Albums worth of work.

118
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,740
Every month.

119
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:20,380
Do not buy another album until you're a Patreon subscriber.

120
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,380
In fact, don't even listen to music.

121
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,380
Don't listen to any music.

122
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:29,420
Cancel your Spotify subscription.

123
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,340
Every time you think you should listen to music, like you're about to be intimate with

124
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,340
your partner.

125
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,340
Throw on season one again.

126
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,340
Yeah.

127
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,340
Just do another re-listen.

128
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,340
Oh my God.

129
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,140
Luke talks about us all being covered in honey at the very beginning.

130
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,260
It's a very sexy podcast.

131
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:50,900
We're very sexy boys.

132
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,140
I've got a story I've been meaning to tell you guys for two and a half months.

133
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,140
Whoa.

134
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,380
Part of the problem is that we mostly hang out on the pod now.

135
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,380
Unfortunately.

136
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,380
Unfortunately.

137
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,500
Part of the problem is that the times we have hung out, I've been saving this story for

138
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
the pod.

139
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,960
And I kept forgetting.

140
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,040
So when we were at the batting cages, you were like, I just want to tell them about

141
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,800
when we were the other day.

142
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,040
See we fucking hang out.

143
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,400
Let's bleep that out so people can't stalk us in our imaginary town.

144
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,080
We only go to two places.

145
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,160
What was I going to say?

146
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
Oh no.

147
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,160
We forgot the story.

148
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
All right.

149
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
Let's get into the app.

150
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
It has been two months.

151
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,160
Okay.

152
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,520
My name is, my name is Thomas Cox and I am in a Cox family group chat with my family

153
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,280
and I'm glad this wasn't a confession.

154
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,880
No, it's an anecdote.

155
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:52,600
Um, the group chat is talking about the time we killed that guy.

156
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,980
I'm like, so yeah, all kinds of things.

157
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:01,240
Whatever we have to talk about when we killed that guy, succession style on a plane.

158
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:08,740
This chat gets made in WhatsApp and I realize from day one that you can make the icon anything

159
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,260
you want.

160
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:16,360
And I think about that for months until I finally pulled the trigger and made it an

161
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,240
eggplant emoji.

162
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,440
Yeah, it's very fitting.

163
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,160
Two mixed, two positive reactions in the group.

164
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,380
Some people thought it was funny.

165
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,380
Some people didn't get it.

166
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:35,760
One person who really didn't think it was funny was no, in the, in the group chat, one

167
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,000
person who really didn't think it was funny was my dad who got angrier than I've ever

168
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,800
seen him about anything fascinating.

169
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,760
I would have not expected that at all.

170
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,260
I got a text.

171
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:55,420
He was like, change it back immediately in a text message to me.

172
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:03,280
And I was, and he was like, people are talking and I go and I go to the group chat and that's

173
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:12,920
like literally true, but not in the way that is text implied.

174
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,160
They're sending memes.

175
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,560
They're asking about each other's weekends.

176
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,840
And it's at this point I'm still like, I don't realize how upset he is and I'm just like,

177
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,880
I mean, anybody can change it.

178
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,420
You can change it back.

179
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,660
And he's like, I don't know how do it.

180
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,860
Do it now.

181
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,660
For those listening, this is uncharacteristic of his father.

182
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,820
It's pornographic.

183
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,940
No wow.

184
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:46,500
And I started like after one of his first texts, I started to pull like the chat.

185
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,820
I was like, should we keep it?

186
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,820
Get rid of it.

187
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,820
I don't get it.

188
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:57,400
That got like about straight evens, like all down.

189
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
So what is it now?

190
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:11,520
Oh, I changed it to a rooster welcome to episode 28 of pretending to be people we've been waiting

191
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,880
two and a half months unwittingly to hear that incredible story.

192
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:26,300
I'm glad that it got sold though.

193
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,300
God damn.

194
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,660
We told you it was a sexy podcast.

195
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,660
You knew it.

196
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,660
You knew it when you see it.

197
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,660
He knows it.

198
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,660
Yeah.

199
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,020
He knew it cause he saw it.

200
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,900
So we left off with the ex.

201
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,380
My step mom didn't get it.

202
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,980
And then when it got explained to her, she said, all I can say is rude.

203
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,980
Wow.

204
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:56,800
And then having to get it explained to you though, you're like, that is very vulgar.

205
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
It's a wiener joke.

206
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
I think my mom would laugh.

207
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
Oh, well Mike.

208
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
Okay.

209
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,320
My aunt, my cool aunt, she was like, yeah, when I first started at a law firm, uh, this

210
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,420
is like in the late seventies or early eighties, she's like, they put me in the only other

211
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,080
woman together and her last name was Peters.

212
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,140
So their name tag said Cox and Peters.

213
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,140
Nice.

214
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,140
Incredible.

215
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,140
Holy shit.

216
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,020
They should have renamed the firm.

217
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,700
Did they make them partners immediately?

218
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,860
No, this was when they're a very junior.

219
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,380
It was just outside their like office store.

220
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,140
Can we have two characters named butts and craps?

221
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,760
Why?

222
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,020
Two funny words, you know?

223
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,080
Ask an answer.

224
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:46,100
We left last episode with Beck making an ex going to give it to you, Joe.

225
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:54,740
Seemingly, but then we realized we hadn't recorded nearly long enough.

226
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,380
We had to come back after we recorded the first time.

227
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,140
It's like, it's not going to do it.

228
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,580
No, we had had a big revelation from your side of the table.

229
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,580
Yeah.

230
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,880
For this episode, a new revelation for everyone.

231
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:18,400
Luke is actually going to be your handler for this episode and I am going to be playing

232
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
Julia Summers.

233
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
Stevie.

234
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
Joe, do you consent to that?

235
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,000
I don't know if I consent to that.

236
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Please don't.

237
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
How prepped are you?

238
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Yeah.

239
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Don't consent.

240
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Please don't.

241
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,780
Now, so you guys are in the Mercedes C class.

242
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:41,220
You're on a FaceTime with Julia Summers as he wraps up this story about his childhood

243
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:51,060
and then his future involvement, very vaguely, with a governmental entity of some sort that

244
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:58,740
exchanges money for jobs with Julia Summers.

245
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,740
An employer?

246
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,740
An employer.

247
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,240
Do you pay taxes?

248
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
It's the government.

249
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,240
They take it out already.

250
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,720
Julius, what kind of house do you pull up to?

251
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:19,640
We're out in one of the suburbs just outside the city and it is like every single house

252
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:27,640
looks the same, just four colors that change every time and it's like robin egg blue, like

253
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:34,780
the really light, creamy yellow pink, which it sucks if you got to get the pink one.

254
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,780
Why?

255
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,780
Yeah.

256
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,780
Why?

257
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,780
What kind of pink?

258
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,780
It's hot pink.

259
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,780
It's hot pink.

260
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,780
The others are a nice pastel.

261
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,780
That sounds rad.

262
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,780
Yeah.

263
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:49,960
And then the fourth one is all those colors stripes.

264
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,400
That's the prized one.

265
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,460
And you pull up in- The Harlequin house.

266
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,620
You pull up to a striped house.

267
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,620
Oh shit.

268
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,620
Nice.

269
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:04,100
And Julius shuts the FaceTime off and gets out of the car and he's like, sorry, it's

270
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,000
the one they had.

271
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,440
Two car garage, two story house, nothing special about it.

272
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,720
Except it's striped.

273
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,280
Except it's striped, which is yeah, special.

274
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,640
And yeah, you walk in and it's just like white carpet.

275
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,520
Hey Julius, can I bother you for a towel and maybe like some soapy water or something?

276
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,260
I got double sicked on.

277
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,260
Yeah.

278
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,260
Sorry.

279
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,220
Sorry for my role in that, Beck.

280
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,220
It's understandable.

281
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,220
I just want to rinse off.

282
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,660
You threw up on him too?

283
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,660
Damn dude.

284
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:43,160
And there's like right next to the entrance is like a little half bathroom and he grabs

285
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,620
a towel and some soap.

286
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,220
I go in there and just kind of clean up a little.

287
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:54,140
Cal is looking at just the bloody footprints that Julius has left on the white carpet.

288
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,520
And when he comes back in, he's like, maybe you should clean up as well.

289
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:03,440
And I think I got some, I got some of my vomit on me too when I, when I found out you were

290
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,960
actually an ex file and that faced me as an inescapable truth.

291
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,480
My body revolted all over Beck.

292
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,120
If you want to clean up, I think there's another bathroom upstairs and you look around and

293
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:22,040
there's like furniture, but there's nothing on the walls that's like not decorated at

294
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,040
all.

295
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,040
It hardly looks lived in.

296
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,300
Do you have a change of clothes here, buddy?

297
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,300
Yeah, plenty.

298
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,660
Um, you try to fit.

299
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,580
Oh no, Cal's like, no, no, no.

300
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,940
I have several spare suits in my trunk.

301
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,060
I just, Julius, he's like, you meant me.

302
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,060
Okay.

303
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,380
Um, are you, are you good?

304
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,820
I'm going to go change.

305
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,820
I'm good.

306
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,140
You should definitely go clean up.

307
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:49,020
Julius runs upstairs to his closet filled with monochromatic suits and he puts on a blue

308
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,260
one and runs back downstairs.

309
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,580
What is Cal Colorado up to?

310
00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:01,500
Cal is Ask Jeevesing, uh, X-Files.

311
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:08,320
Cal is Ask Jeevesing, X-Files.

312
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,520
If that was the one that won, would you say Ask Jeevesing or Asking Jeeves?

313
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
Ask Jeevesing.

314
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:27,840
That's what I thought too.

315
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,840
What does he see?

316
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,840
Ask Jeeves.

317
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:37,200
Um, he gets taken to an IMDB page, but, uh, instantly accepts the prompt to like download

318
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,560
the app and he's waiting on that to happen.

319
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,560
Okay.

320
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,040
So are you heading outside to grab an extra suit to change into?

321
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,040
I know.

322
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,320
I think he's just at the kitchen sink, like kind of brushing himself off.

323
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,420
He just thought he might have to give one to Julius and was preparing himself for that,

324
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,420
that reality.

325
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,420
And back.

326
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,420
What are you up to?

327
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,440
Uh, he has dampened a towel and is just wiping his clothes down.

328
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,860
So he's got wet spots all over his shorts and shirt, but it's a, it's as clean as it's

329
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,480
going to get without being laundered.

330
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
Okey dokey.

331
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:15,680
Uh, I'm going to need Joe and Luke to leave the room for a moment.

332
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,760
Don't go.

333
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,040
Don't leave me here with him.

334
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Good luck.

335
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,040
You're in the kitchen.

336
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,040
Yeah.

337
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,040
Which I assume.

338
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,040
I, okay.

339
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,240
So I was assuming is this like a small living room, kitchen open kind of thing?

340
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,240
Yeah.

341
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,240
Yeah.

342
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:35,320
And you hear, uh, someone coming down the stairs and assume it's probably Julius as

343
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,360
he was the one who went up there and Julius, that was fast.

344
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:47,960
And as you look over your shoulder, you turn and see a woman in a black suit, the white

345
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:55,720
shirt, and you recognize her immediately by the tattoo that is running out of her sleeve

346
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:03,280
down her hand of a tail of some sort, like a scaly tail.

347
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:10,480
And you flash back to a moment the other night on the bridge, the city bridge, when you ran

348
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:19,080
into a very powerful woman who told you that you needed to get off the bridge and get back

349
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,360
where I once belonged.

350
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,320
Where you once belonged.

351
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:33,400
But you remember the feeling of being smitten and it is mixed with surprise.

352
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,680
Oh, hello.

353
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,680
Hello there.

354
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,040
I, I thought you were Julius.

355
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,600
No, I am very much not.

356
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,680
Oh, hello.

357
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,480
Um, you may not remember me.

358
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,800
I'm Cal Colorado.

359
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
We met on the bridge.

360
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,560
Yes, of course, Mr. Colorado.

361
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,080
I know exactly who you are.

362
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,520
Um, yeah.

363
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,720
I don't think I caught your name.

364
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,800
No, you didn't.

365
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:09,880
And she turns and she walks to the bar next to you and swiftly makes a Manhattan.

366
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,380
What time is it?

367
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,160
It's night tool time.

368
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,160
Cool.

369
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,640
Famous mugshot.

370
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,840
Are you, are you X?

371
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,480
I am Santa Claus.

372
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,880
I'm X.

373
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,920
I'm I am who you say I am.

374
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,860
Cal kind of gets over his initial like shock and confusion and, um, remembers what they're

375
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,860
there for.

376
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,640
And he's like, do you have the footage?

377
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,640
Yes.

378
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,640
That's wonderful.

379
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,640
I'll take that.

380
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,680
Yes, you will.

381
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,440
After a bit of a conversation.

382
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:54,520
And at that moment you hear back coming out of the bathroom and joyous popping downstairs.

383
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,680
Oh boys, lover boy.

384
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:06,480
And if he still doesn't answer, it was easier to bird him.

385
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,480
Dude.

386
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,480
It's so scary.

387
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,480
He didn't find that at red racks.

388
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,480
He made that for you.

389
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:18,040
I actually just woke up and it was like, and I can just tell you, it was like, it was like,

390
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,720
and I can just hear the words in my mind.

391
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,840
Give me this.

392
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,600
We're going to post a picture of the president.

393
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:31,880
Luke got me for my birthday on the social media, which is at pretending pod on Instagram

394
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,080
and Twitter and pretending to be people on Facebook.

395
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,080
Wow.

396
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,760
I couldn't have said that less emotion.

397
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
Thank you.

398
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
Tell me.

399
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:45,080
Well, it's because you're actively having your soul sucked out of you while you stare

400
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,760
at this crazy rabbit.

401
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:54,960
You got me a rabbit and the longer you look at it, the broader it's smile becomes growing

402
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,960
more power.

403
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,960
Oh God.

404
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:04,080
You didn't tell me you already have one of those.

405
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,080
So it's a rabbit.

406
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,840
It's standing up right on two legs.

407
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,040
It's very humanoid.

408
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:16,080
But it does not, it has three toe pot pot toes and it's got three paw fingers, but it

409
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,920
is wearing pants and an overcoat and a scarf and it's sinister.

410
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,400
Is it sinister looking?

411
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:30,760
Let me see the scarf as an untied tie, like wide and 30 style, but it may be a scarf.

412
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,020
They're both very creepy.

413
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,100
Also he moves head.

414
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,520
He moves a little bit.

415
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,520
That's not okay.

416
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,600
Do it back and forth.

417
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,880
He's pretty bendy back and forth.

418
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:47,480
He can do anything.

419
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,480
Wait, hold on.

420
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,480
Does that mean he can do?

421
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,480
Oh, okay.

422
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,480
Wow.

423
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,240
He was behind the laptop, so I thought you were making him type and then I looked.

424
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,240
He wasn't making him type.

425
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,520
Nope, but apparently he's Zach's type.

426
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,960
What's his name?

427
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,960
Jack.

428
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,360
Jack.

429
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,540
His name is Jack.

430
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:14,040
For sure his name is Jack based on literally everything about him.

431
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,880
That's the Jackalope that Beck fell on.

432
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,880
His horns came off.

433
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,880
I'm having flashbacks.

434
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,960
Just looking into his eyes.

435
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,320
He is looking right at us.

436
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:28,560
Flashing back into the home of Julius Summers and his roommate.

437
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,920
Beck, you're popping out of the bathroom, a little refreshed.

438
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,920
Half bath refreshed.

439
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,320
It's a specific type of refreshment.

440
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,880
Julius is coming down in equal parts time.

441
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,520
And half bath?

442
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,800
I think you meant without a toilet, right?

443
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:53,960
That is without a toilet, yes, just a shower.

444
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
You walk in.

445
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
There's a four-

446
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,560
Oh yeah, go wash off in the tub room.

447
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,040
There's a four foot tub.

448
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,960
The whole room is a shower, but there's also a bathtub and a sink in there.

449
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,020
It's wild, man.

450
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,900
When my grandma was like 93, she was like, yeah, I've been taking a lot of airplane showers.

451
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,900
Do you know what that is?

452
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,900
And I was like, no.

453
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,860
And she goes, just wings and tail section.

454
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,140
That's awful.

455
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,100
It's also pretty practical.

456
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,740
Oh no.

457
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:26,600
Yeah, Julius is, you see him coming down the stairs, fresh clean suit, still covered in

458
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,060
blood on his skin.

459
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,320
Why?

460
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,980
He did not wash his face off.

461
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,740
Beck, when you pop out of the bathroom, Joyce is coming down the stairs at the exact same

462
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,740
time.

463
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,740
Please roll grip.

464
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,500
It's a fail.

465
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:50,700
I believe that you are just going to lose one grip here, as this has happened before

466
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,820
and you have found a way to deal with it.

467
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,700
You've learned, but it's still going to grab you for a moment.

468
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,220
I come around the corner and kind of almost bump into you.

469
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,220
Oh, Julius.

470
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,220
Hey.

471
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,100
And Beck is suddenly kind of looking down at his feet.

472
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,900
Hey man, uh, why don't we go like no coats today?

473
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,740
Like that'd be like, uh, like it's nice out.

474
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,020
Would that be, that'd be cool?

475
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,020
Sure.

476
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,020
Yeah.

477
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:23,020
I, uh, he takes his jacket off and he's wearing like a, just a short sleeve t-shirt under

478
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,020
that.

479
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,940
And he sees blood all over him and he's like, oh yeah, sorry, I'm going to go wash up.

480
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,940
Cool, cool, cool.

481
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,940
Right on man.

482
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,940
Right on.

483
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,980
Into the half bath and turns the water on.

484
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,540
Luke, leave the room.

485
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,540
This is hilarious.

486
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:48,220
It's a cleaning episode.

487
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:53,860
We couldn't just cut to the next fucking scene because the way we've always role played.

488
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:58,940
Not enough role playing podcasts place proper emphasis on hygiene.

489
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,540
We shit on this podcast.

490
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,140
We eat on this podcast.

491
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,860
We love on this podcast.

492
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,860
God damn it.

493
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:11,700
Um, uh, uh, Beck, uh, this is, this is X.

494
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,020
Oh hello.

495
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:20,780
And you see a woman, uh, in a black suit and white shirt and you recognize the tattoo running

496
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,300
out of her sleeve.

497
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,300
Oh shit.

498
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,940
You might remember her from the bridge.

499
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,940
Oh yeah.

500
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,260
You were, you were at the hole.

501
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,260
Yes.

502
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,260
That was.

503
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,260
You remember us?

504
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,260
We were there too.

505
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,260
Shh.

506
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,260
Did you see it?

507
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,260
Incredible.

508
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,260
Wow.

509
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:42,540
It was, it was, um, well you kind of ran us out of there before we got to see much.

510
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,580
What did you see?

511
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,060
Did you see the whole thing?

512
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,060
No pun intended.

513
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,140
It was a good one though.

514
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,140
She smiles.

515
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,140
Yeah.

516
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,140
We saw.

517
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,140
Hmm.

518
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,140
Did you see how smooth it was?

519
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,140
Yeah.

520
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,180
It was, it was pretty smooth where it was weird.

521
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,180
Yeah.

522
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,700
It was very weird.

523
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,140
Have you been in this line of work a long time?

524
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,140
Yes.

525
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,900
Yes I have.

526
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,940
Did you become Julius's mom after you guys abducted him?

527
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,940
No.

528
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,880
How would you like describe your relationship with him?

529
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,880
Are you like his boss?

530
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,880
Yeah.

531
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
Are you like his boss?

532
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,100
That's the exact question I wanted to ask because can you talk to him about like the

533
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,100
blood thing?

534
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,100
Oh yes.

535
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:29,020
Well it seemed like he was going to go clean off so hopefully he does.

536
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:32,140
What do you make of the fact that he didn't?

537
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:40,860
In our line of work people often end up in situations where they don't enjoy certain

538
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,060
things.

539
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,060
Normal activities.

540
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:50,220
For instance, I don't know if you noticed but when your camera man here was walking

541
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:57,260
up he got super fucking weird about Mr. Summers wearing a coat.

542
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,260
Is that right?

543
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,580
No, he got weird because he was covered in blood.

544
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,980
And he was wearing a coat too.

545
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,700
He's always had the coat thing as long as I've known back he's had that coat thing

546
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,700
I think.

547
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,660
So I'm just saying that's- Wait you don't think he's taking a bath in

548
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,660
there do you?

549
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,660
I hope not.

550
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,320
Me too.

551
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,300
So you kind of did avoid our question though.

552
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,300
Are you his boss?

553
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,840
Or like his partner maybe?

554
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,460
Like what is your like hierarchy?

555
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,820
Uh yeah boss sure.

556
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,020
Did you put him on cam?

557
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,020
Yeah.

558
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:33,340
Well that that was why we utilized Agent Summers yeah.

559
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,980
Did you mean to get us involved or was that like an accident?

560
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,620
Oh total accident.

561
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:44,020
I did not know that things were going to progress so quickly and she looks over her shoulder

562
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:51,740
and the very very quiet quiet the very very quiet Stevie and Jeremy who are sitting on

563
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:57,660
the couch over in the living room and she kind of pees at them and she's like yes I

564
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:05,660
didn't know that certain people would be involved and I didn't know that more people

565
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,660
would be involved.

566
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:11,140
Yeah no I had no idea that things would things would get out of hand this fast.

567
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,940
Did you send us the pin that told us where to go?

568
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,940
Real quick.

569
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,940
Roll human for me.

570
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,300
Twenty four on a seventy.

571
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,240
Eighty six on a forty.

572
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,460
Joe go la la.

573
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,380
Thomas she's smiling super fucking big when she says that things got out of hand really

574
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,860
fast like this is exactly what she wants.

575
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,860
You're back Joe.

576
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,860
Hello.

577
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,860
Hello.

578
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,340
I uh I lean over and whisper in Bec's ear.

579
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,340
Nice.

580
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,340
Watch your back with this one.

581
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:47,140
I don't know if she's a friend of journalism.

582
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,340
Okay okay.

583
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,900
So what's the plan?

584
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,100
How do we roll it out?

585
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,980
Well uh you said you would give us the footage.

586
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,740
Sure but we need a game plan.

587
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:05,400
Are you going to put it all out there at once or are we going to slowly kind of you know

588
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:10,620
divvy it out to the people that way we can kind of move you up uh I heard that there

589
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:17,380
have been some openings at City Action News we can probably get you wherever you need

590
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:22,820
to be to make sure this story is out there in the open and getting the traction it deserves.

591
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:27,140
I turned down a very similar offer from a dead man not hours ago.

592
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:36,820
Was the offer to tell the story that you want to tell or was it to cover the ass of the

593
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,820
Godel company?

594
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:45,780
So here's how I see it a three-night event Cal Colorado trapped in the it bit.

595
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,340
Bec is nodding vigorously.

596
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,340
She's loving it.

597
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,740
And then I think you know like well obviously type's position is open and uh in the dead

598
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:57,200
ball days back in the 20s and such it wasn't uncommon for there to be a player manager

599
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:03,400
of sorts so I could I could I could steer the direction of canoes towards towards the

600
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,340
truth towards telling people what's really good.

601
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:11,380
Not lead perhaps I think I'd still do my uh little Cal stories I kind of like these.

602
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,100
Oh growth.

603
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:18,260
We had an incident with our editor where like they kind of like went a little crazy after

604
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,140
seeing the footage so we all kind of talked about that we would kind of drip feed the

605
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,980
footage a little slowly.

606
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,900
Yes we have uh nab terror.

607
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,900
You've pardon?

608
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,900
Yes.

609
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:40,860
Like uh in a pp or in a bb bb okay as in boy boy yeah um that one's still pretty concerning

610
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,860
though.

611
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:47,140
Great yeah yeah obviously if I step into this kind of position I will be sort of you know

612
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:52,340
I'm all I would need to report these sort of things to HR and I have a therapy consult

613
00:32:52,340 --> 00:33:05,140
with someone who understands human role six which is of course easily contested yeah no

614
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:11,420
you're on board she's she's telling the truth why wouldn't they want to get someone that

615
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:16,780
understands and that they can keep the secret yeah we just need them to like get it out

616
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:21,660
right they blurt it out and then uh they've told someone they feel good about it and then

617
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:26,520
they can go back to their lives and kind of we help set them straight so they can go back

618
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:33,780
to their lives this isn't like a you're not sending them off to Siberia no no not Siberia

619
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,780
no.

620
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:41,700
Hold on though I mean after the story gets out the full story on day three everybody

621
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:50,580
will know yes absolutely so what's the point that's my question yes so we agree uh no no

622
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:55,460
I don't think we do what's the point of uh until we get this thing out there do you want

623
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:02,100
her to just be grieving this loss of reality she should be speaking to someone and getting

624
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,700
the treatment that she needs I guess we do need to keep a lid on her until the story

625
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,860
fully breaks but once it fully breaks like everybody's gonna be able to talk to each

626
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:16,900
other about it like it's not right so then they'll be able to go on 72 hours of pain

627
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:24,660
is that not mean anything to you yeah yeah that sounds pretty fucking significant from

628
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:31,140
a story perspective I would like to human that and see how significantly uh Cal takes

629
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:36,820
it I mean or whatever she's talking about Vivica like being in pain for 72 hours before

630
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:43,500
the story breaks oh I thought you meant inflicting 72 hours of like psychic torture on the people

631
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:50,900
of the world with this new story you have you have this whole thing so wrong well Julius'

632
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:55,980
story was pretty disturbing of how he came into your organization oh well that was the

633
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:02,300
fucking 90s or whatever right like how old is he not that old oh right he's only like

634
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:10,080
29 so that was like the oh that was the tens that was those were worse than the 90s everyone

635
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:15,240
was listening to arcade fire I'll have to take your word for it have you heard the blues

636
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:20,260
brothers soundtracks I feel like I should go check on Julius he's been out there for

637
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:31,260
a while yeah let's all weird that he's doing check on them I just got really into it it

638
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:37,620

639
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:52,940

640
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:58,460

641
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:08,620
he said God I was like what happened back loss is fucking mine see you so soon oh I won't forget

642
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:15,060
this time I promise sorry Luke I totally forgot about what you I was just in the roleplay and I

643
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:21,660
feel yeah you were cleaning yourself for a good long while I wonder why it took so long roll grip

644
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:31,420
roll grip motherfucker all eight I pass oh shit so he turns on the water you you look at it and

645
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:41,100
as you look at it you start smelling sailing can you almost start hearing this is that a voice in

646
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:48,660
your head and then it just what do you think about to just like push this away clean up clean up

647
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:54,100
everybody do you share clean up and he starts washing his hands and like washing the blood

648
00:36:54,100 --> 00:37:01,540
off his arms and face eyes closed yeah and he Luke is currently at washing his body washing

649
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:07,380
his face washing everywhere where blood got on it and then he wipes his eyes and looks at himself

650
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:20,940
in the mirror and that does not pass that's a 60 on a 23 for those of you who are averse to bodily

651
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:34,740
mutilation I would advise skip a little bit skip for it a little bit here as Julius looks into the

652
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:42,900
mirror the scent of sailing has just kind of passed and he looks and the blood's gone but

653
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:53,180
that's not your face that's not Julius no what face is it not Julius is okay so Julius sees

654
00:37:53,180 --> 00:38:00,380
Julius but like to him it's just off it's not really not him it's like if you saw like a really

655
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:10,340
good wax figure of yourself oh fuck that no and so he's like trends like and he's like kind of

656
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:15,460
wiping at his face you know that you're feeling like this but you're looking at yourself in the

657
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:22,340
mirror and you are smiling back at yourself at Julius wipes harder and harder and harder and

658
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:28,300
nothing's coming off and he smiles getting bigger he looks underneath the sink that he's using and

659
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:38,900
he opens it up and he grabs out like a bristle brush for cleaning and he just keeps scrubbing

660
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:43,860
and scrubbing all over and he's he throws it down and he's trying to like get his fingernail

661
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:49,540
underneath the skin on his jaw and just trying to get under there and start peeling and at that

662
00:38:49,540 --> 00:39:00,540
moment you hear and Julius starts scrubbing behind the ears and then he puts the brush

663
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:12,260
down and just leaves the bathroom damn dude that was intense how fucked up is he so fucked up man

664
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:18,980
like literally I mean imagine that you took did that yeah dude those bristles like it's not a big

665
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:26,220
thing but if you rub hard skin over and over and over for minutes like for your face skin pretty

666
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:34,780
deep scratches yeah it looks like you got clawed by one of those like light up toys that they give

667
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:42,180
kids at amusement parks that has like all of those long strands that come together at the end it's

668
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:49,660
just like one of those came alive was very angry and fucked you up or a toilet brush or toilet

669
00:39:49,660 --> 00:40:10,100
brush bird bird bird bird you holler something about the ears you get behind the ears water still

670
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:18,940
running shuts off and then turning the corner you see Julius Summers with scratches all over

671
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:27,380
one side of his face oh shit how deep well you see in his hand like scrubby brush that uses a clean

672
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:34,380
like the sink or you know similar to a toilet brush but it's not the toilet brush and there's

673
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:42,420
bloody oh you really did get like really hard behind the ears man Beck wants to grab a towel

674
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:47,540
and maybe are they bleeding are you bleeding actively bleeding from just a little bit maybe

675
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:52,380
just like a little trickles here and there yeah beating up but there's scratches all over a tiny

676
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:58,420
little scratches out like takes the scrubby from your hand if you're like if you're just holding it

677
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:04,820
oh yeah sorry Cal whips around at X and he's like this isn't just the fucking jacket thing oh

678
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:12,140
hey he sees X isn't you know this isn't like if I saw you know this isn't this isn't just some

679
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:21,040
little deal he's hurting himself she turns around and grabs a glass off the counter and turns on the

680
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,580
faucet to pour herself a glass of water I'm cool with that it's just a little glass it's not like

681
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:34,420
the tub or anything oh good 20 he's fine it's just a little glass she turns around takes a big

682
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:49,740
oh 65 not not a pass and Julius just is frozen staring off into space lose one Beck you're

683
00:41:49,740 --> 00:42:01,020
noticing as Cal is in this confrontation with this suited woman she takes a big gulp we all do

684
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:10,260
what we do in the service of making this world a better place by shining a light of truth out into

685
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:15,460
the world is that not correct mr. Colorado that's what I do I don't know what the hell this is

686
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:23,660
unfortunately for everyone there are things in this world that do not act according to the

687
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:30,660
nature that we were once taught they are happening more frequently and they are affecting our world

688
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:38,660
at large I need you to understand this before we move forward I need you to understand this

689
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:51,180
now she's a cat lady my experience those things are mostly people you seem like one of them I am

690
00:42:51,180 --> 00:43:07,620
on your side we are on your side human pass for cow not pass for Beck 67 on a 40 yeah I mean it's

691
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:16,300
pretty straightforward here she is absolutely lying to you however for this project this

692
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:27,180
situation my current objective is to out the truth on the Godel company to show the world that things

693
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:38,180
unnatural to our world are happening at their behest I want that to be known do you want that

694
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:43,500
to be known as well for the first time Cal is questioning that when he hears the way she's

695
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:58,180
talking about it okay so give us our footage and we'll take our friend and we'll get out of here

696
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:05,940
and run the story I also want that to happen and good that's great so let's just do that it's going

697
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:16,540
to take a day or two to get things in order as far as she looks at Julius she looks back at the

698
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:23,700
two of you you know the murder oh are you gonna nab him no no no no no oh right you killed type

699
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:36,980
and two other people not people just cops that's right oh all cops are gaskards after we're done

700
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:46,060
here can we talk about the promotion absolutely two of them two of them the footage is right there

701
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:51,900
she points to the couch and you do see like on the other side of the couch there's a duffel bag

702
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:58,460
that goes over to get it and grabs it yep the footage is inside it seems to all be there is

703
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:04,180
it the stuff I mean it looks like it is it my hard drive is it the one that was stolen from my

704
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:11,380
pocket or did is it copied no no it is yours yeah it's my it's my hard drive at least I have to plug

705
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:20,540
it in see if it's there my drives hard hot damn back when you look down at your hand with the

706
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:27,980
phone drive in it there's blood on your hand from where you grab the bag when you unzipped it oh

707
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:36,140
gross this is he's holding up the hand this is this is one of the cops I assume real grip

708
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:49,660
that's a hot one I looked I'm like is that 60 I can't tell if this is a one but it is a one

709
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:58,380
dude I gained one grip how have your objectives changed in the world getting the footage back

710
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:04,300
probably it feels probably really good to back like this was that's I mean that's his footage

711
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:10,980
that's always been a thing now that we've got some it seems like backup in this whole thing with X I

712
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:18,140
think that he feels like we're untouchable we're doing we're back on the right track when Beck is

713
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:27,860
holding up his bloody hand this is like at any cost right Beck Beck cautiously nods yeah I mean

714
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:34,300
yeah you gotta break a few eggs to make omelet right cow just kind of looks down at the ground

715
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:43,180
yeah back and I think we can agree we got some bad eggs in the city yeah yeah bad eggs she reaches

716
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:55,500
her hand out to Cal Colorado agent Diggory Cal Colorado go make some news mr. Colorado in 48

717
00:46:55,500 --> 00:47:02,660
hours okay yeah the producer job will be yours just walk on in as if it is that you mean mine

718
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:11,820
and he's the anchor Oh Julius type said I could have it oh yeah I'm really sorry Julius but your

719
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:18,300
boss here just promised it to me you could be you could be anchor I was just gonna do kind of

720
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:23,620
a you want me to be the anchor whatever no no probably I don't actually since I'll be producer

721
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:29,780
I've never heard you talk about wanting to be a producer before well I could direct the network

722
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:35,620
to a more just and and and truthful vision of the world I could I could put what's really important

723
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:47,020
on there okay Julius remembers that he's only cared about this literally for like a week

724
00:47:47,020 --> 00:48:08,620
then it settled we avoided potentially months of in real time Julius thinks about like about

725
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:15,220
arguing and then things about killing goffs and how it was pretty sick to do that and he's like

726
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:23,300
priorities but could we could we talk a minute just just you and me yeah what you got by the way

727
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:28,900
congrats on the promotion well you know nothing's final yet I guess we'll know in 48 hours but it

728
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:33,140
feels good right yeah I mean well it actually kind of feels real bad it's kind of a bummer

729
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:40,500
that that's kind of what I want to talk well we just had a little scare yeah we thought we lost

730
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:50,940
that whole episode which was we were the ones experiencing the horror podcast I lost so much

731
00:48:50,940 --> 00:49:00,540
grip my face turned white then we went into our handy friend the internet and the first thing we

732
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:07,140
heard from a man on YouTube was this is why when and then he said the exact thing that happened to

733
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:22,100
us happens I don't freak out and it made us all feel and then Thomas embraced yeah with fervor

734
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:28,380
which was good because my girlfriend has been telling me I need to hug my friends because I

735
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:36,220
want like you want too much yeah well you can squeeze me baby I need you need squeezes I'm

736
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:45,300
gonna squeeze you all tonight I need Thomas so you were just pulling a sorry Cal Colorado

737
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:52,100
was just pulling back wilder aside so we had Luke leave the room yeah congrats on the promotion

738
00:49:52,100 --> 00:50:00,740
dude it doesn't actually I was gonna start at a different spot okay that's kind of what I wanted

739
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:06,420
to talk to you about so it doesn't really feel great like does it it's kind of it's bittersweet

740
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:14,980
like you don't really film producers very often I don't know if we're gonna be like oh Beck you'll

741
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:21,340
don't worry about that listen we have a lot of time to talk about where you'll be in this

742
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:26,220
organization but doesn't it kind of seem weird what's going on here like does it seem like

743
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:32,020
doesn't seem like me like it's kind of scary when she talks about how much she wants this stuff to

744
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:35,740
happen and it doesn't really feel like it feels like maybe this is some sort of splinter group

745
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:41,700
from the other group that abducted him is maybe the vibe I'm getting like I think she's rogue oh

746
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:48,460
dude I did not even think about that I she is cold that's for sure but at the end of the day

747
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:52,820
she wants to show the footage right and that's what we want what if it's what if it's too powerful

748
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:59,660
I mean yeah for sure we I think we kind of did this conversation back with Vivica we just we

749
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:04,300
were gonna try and do it slower this time you thinking we shouldn't do it at all dude we've

750
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:12,420
got the footage now we can protect it we've got 48 hours to decide and and see what Julius and his

751
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:19,500
people want from it if we can yeah we're investigative journalists let's investigate we play

752
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:24,340
it close to the chest I'm good with that it's best but no it's like you hold your cards up

753
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:29,220
really close to your chest so nobody can see Oh Beck people tell me I should correct less

754
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:44,620
anyway yeah I think we're on the same page take it slow we'll take it slow that was fucking

755
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:56,900
masterful yeah that was I'm really glad you dropped that holy shit okay let's play it cool

756
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:05,220
and they I like Cal turns around and awkwardly winks at Julius whose face is just like dripping

757
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:18,700
with blood next let's get him back on Ian hello hello is it me you're looking for no I've peed

758
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:31,780
now several times I do not have to pee anymore tonight Julius Julius has been just looking off

759
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:39,780
kind of not paying attention for a minute suddenly Cal Colorado turns back and looks at you and you

760
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:48,900
kind of notice and then he gives you a wink yeah and Julius winks back Cal turns back he's like oh

761
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:54,320
I think I think he thinks I'm flirting with him yeah it was kind of weird to return the

762
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:07,240
yeah I kind of that's the vibe I got Julius hi no Julius says that to Cal oh yeah okay um I have

763
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:20,800
a powerful natural charisma they can be mistaken anyway I'm just saying don't worry Julius it

764
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:27,960
happens all the time I've seen it dozens of times what are we gonna do to until we can put it on the

765
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:32,840
news there's the question well that's that's the good thing Julius now that we've secured the
