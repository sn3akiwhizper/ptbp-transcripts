408.64 451.54 speaker3  Hey you said what kind of world are you living in? Well if you have listened to this podcast you might be familiar with the band Dragon in 3 and Zach was just giving us a little sample. They have two singles out right now and they're very good. I just got the new shirt, it rips, it just came in the mail, it's really rad.
450.54 454.54 speaker2  Oh that's a bummer. It rips. It rips.

489.34 492.74 speaker3  Patreon.com slash pretending pod.
491.74 518.34 speaker2  Albums worth of work. Every month. In fact, don't even listen to music. Every time you think you should listen to music, like you're about to be intimate with your partner. Throw on season one again. Yeah.
517.34 519.34 speaker3  Just do another re-listen.
518.34 525.26 speaker2  Oh my God. Luke talks about us all being covered in honey at the very beginning.
522.54 539.38 speaker3  It's a very sexy podcast.
536.14 541.38 speaker2  Part of the problem is that we mostly hang out on the pod now. Unfortunately.
540.38 554.04 speaker3  Unfortunately. the pod.
549.96 556.80 speaker2  So when we were at the batting cages, you were like, I just want to tell them about
554.04 565.08 speaker3  when we were the other day.
563.40 569.16 speaker2  We only go to two places.
568.16 572.16 speaker3  Oh no. We forgot the story.
571.16 575.16 speaker2  All right. Let's get into the app.
574.16 621.44 speaker3  Okay. I'm like, so yeah, all kinds of things. Whatever we have to talk about when we killed that guy, succession style on a plane. you want. And I think about that for months until I finally pulled the trigger and made it an eggplant emoji.
618.24 629.38 speaker2  Yeah, it's very fitting.
627.38 676.56 speaker3  Some people didn't get it. I got a text. He was like, change it back immediately in a text message to me.
674.16 682.84 speaker2  They're asking about each other's weekends.
676.56 696.66 speaker3  And it's at this point I'm still like, I don't realize how upset he is and I'm just like, I mean, anybody can change it. You can change it back. And he's like, I don't know how do it.
691.86 706.50 speaker2  For those listening, this is uncharacteristic of his father. It's pornographic. No wow.
700.94 753.66 speaker3  And I started like after one of his first texts, I started to pull like the chat. I don't get it.
752.66 755.66 speaker2  You knew it when you see it.
754.66 777.80 speaker3  Yeah. So we left off with the ex. My step mom didn't get it.
776.80 780.80 speaker2  It's a wiener joke.
779.80 803.70 speaker3  Okay. My aunt, my cool aunt, she was like, yeah, when I first started at a law firm, uh, this is like in the late seventies or early eighties, she's like, they put me in the only other woman together and her last name was Peters. Nice. Incredible. Holy shit.
802.02 808.38 speaker2  Did they make them partners immediately?
805.86 849.88 speaker3  It was just outside their like office store. Can we have two characters named butts and craps? Why? We left last episode with Beck making an ex going to give it to you, Joe. We had to come back after we recorded the first time.
844.64 859.40 speaker2  For this episode, a new revelation for everyone. Luke is actually going to be your handler for this episode and I am going to be playing
858.40 867.00 speaker3  Julia Summers. Stevie. Joe, do you consent to that? Please don't.
866.00 906.24 speaker2  Yeah. Don't consent. You're on a FaceTime with Julia Summers as he wraps up this story about his childhood An employer? An employer.
905.24 935.78 speaker3  It's the government. They take it out already. We're out in one of the suburbs just outside the city and it is like every single house looks the same, just four colors that change every time and it's like robin egg blue, like
934.78 942.78 speaker2  Why? Yeah. Why? What kind of pink? It's hot pink. It's hot pink. The others are a nice pastel.
941.78 988.26 speaker3  That sounds rad. Yeah. And then the fourth one is all those colors stripes. You pull up to a striped house. Oh shit. Nice. And Julius shuts the FaceTime off and gets out of the car and he's like, sorry, it's the one they had. Two car garage, two story house, nothing special about it. And yeah, you walk in and it's just like white carpet.
984.52 994.22 speaker1  I got double sicked on. Yeah.
993.22 998.66 speaker2  It's understandable. I just want to rinse off.
997.66 1005.62 speaker3  Damn dude. And there's like right next to the entrance is like a little half bathroom and he grabs
1003.16 1017.52 speaker2  a towel and some soap.
1014.14 1052.94 speaker3  And when he comes back in, he's like, maybe you should clean up as well. actually an ex file and that faced me as an inescapable truth. there's like furniture, but there's nothing on the walls that's like not decorated at all. It hardly looks lived in. Um, you try to fit.
1050.58 1057.06 speaker2  I have several spare suits in my trunk.
1052.94 1071.26 speaker3  I just, Julius, he's like, you meant me. Okay. Um, are you, are you good? I'm going to go change. I'm good. You should definitely go clean up. Julius runs upstairs to his closet filled with monochromatic suits and he puts on a blue
1069.02 1093.52 speaker2  one and runs back downstairs. What is Cal Colorado up to?
1088.32 1094.52 speaker3  If that was the one that won, would you say Ask Jeevesing or Asking Jeeves?
1093.52 1108.84 speaker2  Ask Jeevesing.
1107.84 1121.56 speaker3  What does he see? Ask Jeeves.
1120.56 1129.32 speaker2  Okay. So are you heading outside to grab an extra suit to change into?
1126.04 1146.48 speaker3  I think he's just at the kitchen sink, like kind of brushing himself off. He just thought he might have to give one to Julius and was preparing himself for that, that reality.
1144.86 1155.68 speaker1  going to get without being laundered.
1147.48 1162.04 speaker2  Uh, I'm going to need Joe and Luke to leave the room for a moment.
1161.04 1168.24 speaker3  Which I assume. I, okay. So I was assuming is this like a small living room, kitchen open kind of thing?
1167.24 1240.04 speaker2  Yeah. Yeah. And you hear, uh, someone coming down the stairs and assume it's probably Julius as And as you look over your shoulder, you turn and see a woman in a black suit, the white shirt, and you recognize her immediately by the tattoo that is running out of her sleeve down her hand of a tail of some sort, like a scaly tail. And you flash back to a moment the other night on the bridge, the city bridge, when you ran into a very powerful woman who told you that you needed to get off the bridge and get back where I once belonged. But you remember the feeling of being smitten and it is mixed with surprise.
1237.68 1255.08 speaker3  I, I thought you were Julius. Um, you may not remember me. I'm Cal Colorado. We met on the bridge.
1252.56 1258.72 speaker2  I know exactly who you are. Um, yeah.
1256.52 1269.88 speaker3  I don't think I caught your name.
1260.80 1297.86 speaker2  And she turns and she walks to the bar next to you and swiftly makes a Manhattan. What time is it? Are you, are you X? I'm X. I'm I am who you say I am.
1296.86 1328.48 speaker3  there for. And he's like, do you have the footage? Yes. That's wonderful. I'll take that.
1327.48 1339.72 speaker2  It's so scary.
1338.04 1354.08 speaker3  and I can just hear the words in my mind.
1351.88 1365.08 speaker2  and Twitter and pretending to be people on Facebook. Wow. I couldn't have said that less emotion. Thank you. Tell me.
1359.76 1367.76 speaker3  Well, it's because you're actively having your soul sucked out of you while you stare
1365.08 1410.76 speaker2  at this crazy rabbit. more power. Oh God. So it's a rabbit. It's standing up right on two legs. It's very humanoid. But it does not, it has three toe pot pot toes and it's got three paw fingers, but it is wearing pants and an overcoat and a scarf and it's sinister. Is it sinister looking?
1403.40 1418.60 speaker3  Let me see the scarf as an untied tie, like wide and 30 style, but it may be a scarf. They're both very creepy.
1417.52 1431.48 speaker2  Do it back and forth. Wait, hold on. Does that mean he can do?
1430.48 1454.04 speaker3  Wow. He wasn't making him type. Nope, but apparently he's Zach's type.
1449.54 1457.88 speaker2  For sure his name is Jack based on literally everything about him. That's the Jackalope that Beck fell on.
1456.88 1473.92 speaker3  His horns came off.
1468.56 1485.80 speaker2  Beck, you're popping out of the bathroom, a little refreshed. Half bath refreshed. It's a specific type of refreshment. Julius is coming down in equal parts time.
1483.52 1495.96 speaker3  I think you meant without a toilet, right?
1494.96 1499.04 speaker0  There's a four-
1497.56 1504.02 speaker2  There's a four foot tub.
1502.96 1539.74 speaker3  It's wild, man. Do you know what that is? And I was like, no. blood on his skin. He did not wash his face off.
1538.74 1561.22 speaker2  time. Please roll grip. and you have found a way to deal with it. You've learned, but it's still going to grab you for a moment.
1560.22 1577.02 speaker1  Oh, Julius. Hey. And Beck is suddenly kind of looking down at his feet.
1576.02 1622.14 speaker3  Yeah. I, uh, he takes his jacket off and he's wearing like a, just a short sleeve t-shirt under that. And he sees blood all over him and he's like, oh yeah, sorry, I'm going to go wash up. Right on.
1620.54 1625.86 speaker2  We eat on this podcast.
1623.86 1640.78 speaker3  God damn it.
1633.02 1655.26 speaker2  And you see a woman, uh, in a black suit and white shirt and you recognize the tattoo running out of her sleeve. Oh yeah. We were there too. Shh.
1654.26 1663.58 speaker1  Incredible.
1662.54 1669.14 speaker3  What did you see? Did you see the whole thing? No pun intended.
1668.14 1676.14 speaker2  She smiles. Yeah. We saw. Hmm.
1675.14 1695.88 speaker3  Yeah. It was, it was pretty smooth where it was weird. Yeah. Have you been in this line of work a long time?
1694.88 1696.88 speaker1  Are you like his boss?
1695.88 1730.22 speaker3  Yeah. Are you like his boss? That's the exact question I wanted to ask because can you talk to him about like the blood thing? Oh yes. What do you make of the fact that he didn't? things.
1724.06 1738.26 speaker2  For instance, I don't know if you noticed but when your camera man here was walking up he got super fucking weird about Mr. Summers wearing a coat.
1737.26 1773.34 speaker3  Is that right? No, he got weird because he was covered in blood. there do you? I hope not. Me too. Are you his boss? Yeah.
1768.78 1841.34 speaker2  Well that that was why we utilized Agent Summers yeah. I did not know that things were going to progress so quickly and she looks over her shoulder and the very very quiet quiet the very very quiet Stevie and Jeremy who are sitting on didn't know that certain people would be involved and I didn't know that more people would be involved. Thomas she's smiling super fucking big when she says that things got out of hand really
1838.86 1865.40 speaker3  I uh I lean over and whisper in Bec's ear. Nice. Watch your back with this one. Well uh you said you would give us the footage.
1860.74 1907.34 speaker2  Are you going to put it all out there at once or are we going to slowly kind of you know divvy it out to the people that way we can kind of move you up uh I heard that there have been some openings at City Action News we can probably get you wherever you need to be to make sure this story is out there in the open and getting the traction it deserves. Godel company?
1905.78 1941.14 speaker3  Bec is nodding vigorously. And then I think you know like well obviously type's position is open and uh in the dead ball days back in the 20s and such it wasn't uncommon for there to be a player manager
1938.26 1961.86 speaker1  seeing the footage so we all kind of talked about that we would kind of drip feed the footage a little slowly.
1960.86 2014.78 speaker3  though.
2013.78 2021.70 speaker2  no.
2015.14 2042.10 speaker3  Hold on though I mean after the story gets out the full story on day three everybody
2035.46 2046.70 speaker2  her to just be grieving this loss of reality she should be speaking to someone and getting
2042.10 2447.54 speaker3  the treatment that she needs I guess we do need to keep a lid on her until the story a story perspective I would like to human that and see how significantly uh Cal takes everybody do you share clean up and he starts washing his hands and like washing the blood his face washing everywhere where blood got on it and then he wipes his eyes and looks at himself and scrubbing all over and he's he throws it down and he's trying to like get his fingernail underneath the skin on his jaw and just trying to get under there and start peeling and at that
2442.42 2530.26 speaker1  and maybe are they bleeding are you bleeding actively bleeding from just a little bit maybe
2521.02 2711.38 speaker2  what we do in the service of making this world a better place by shining a light of truth out into nature that we were once taught they are happening more frequently and they are affecting our world at large I need you to understand this before we move forward I need you to understand this
2704.18 2727.98 speaker1  pocket or did is it copied no no it is yours yeah it's my it's my hard drive at least I have to plug

2940.54 3035.74 speaker2  heard from a man on YouTube was this is why when and then he said the exact thing that happened to
3032.02 3064.30 speaker3  happen and it doesn't really feel like it feels like maybe this is some sort of splinter group from the other group that abducted him is maybe the vibe I'm getting like I think she's rogue oh
3059.66 3125.22 speaker1  were gonna try and do it slower this time you thinking we shouldn't do it at all dude we've
3116.90 3312.64 speaker3  and they I like Cal turns around and awkwardly winks at Julius whose face is just like dripping footage you can come with us to the hospital and nobody has to split up we'll stay right there with pretty amazing what Stevie managed to do with a target first-aid kit and some old fast-food napkins but I think a doctor should look at that gunshot wound yeah and he like kind of touched it
