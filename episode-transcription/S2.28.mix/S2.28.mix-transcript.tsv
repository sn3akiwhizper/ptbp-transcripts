0	4000	Shhh, listen, do y'all hear that?
4000	7880	The skittering of many greasy limbs?
7880	16180	It's almost like dozens of giant fingers gently slipping around on a bowling lane, and yet
16180	18180	so fast.
18180	24640	I'm sure it's nothing, but listen here, what ain't nothing is me saying howdy and hello
24640	29380	and welcome to 694.2 PTBP.
29380	38120	It is I, the one, the only, probably, DJ Wolf the dog, and if this many-limbed being doesn't
38120	42620	snatch me up, I think we got a banger of a show for y'all.
42620	50740	I howl, you howl, we all howl for howlin' with Wolf, and this particular howlin' with
50740	57740	Wolf is from Sneaky Whisper, and they have requested their location to be broadcast as
57740	59240	the internet.
59240	65740	Sneaky Whisper from the internet tweeted about the show and tagged at pretending pod, a thing
65740	68440	that internet folks should do.
68440	71400	Are you on the internet, dear listener?
71400	75960	You could also tweet about the show, whoa.
75960	82440	Sneaky Whisper writes, Dear Wolf, I was able to break through the interdimensional firewall
82440	85680	to get you this limited character message.
85680	91560	I've been stuck in this dimension they call cyberspace and heard your dimension may be
91560	96000	having a similar polymorphic virus problem as mine.
96000	104000	Whatever you do, do not feed them the 0x dead beef, and for the rest of your radio listeners,
104000	110920	the cow has red spots, the cat broke the fiddle, and the spoon did not go willingly with the
110920	111920	dish.
111920	118720	Be excellent to each other out there in meatspace, meatspace you say?
118720	126440	Now I've been all over the place exploring different space time things or whatever, but
126440	129200	I ain't never been to a meatspace.
129200	135300	Damn, I need to book me a space B&B in this meatspace dimension.
135300	140480	If you want to write up something for your vigilant Wolf to howl, tag at pretending pod
140480	146520	on the Instagram or the Twitter, or tag pretending to be people on the Facebook.
146520	151760	Or you can do us a favor and write up a five star review on the podcast app of your choice
151760	155280	and holler at me about it so I know.
155280	161480	And by the by, fuck Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg too.
161480	163600	Now for some links.
163600	168920	Bonus content on Patreon, merch at the merch store.
168920	176220	Picks of the boys on Instagram, retweets of Luke's Twitter on Twitter, harsh criticisms
176220	184880	of early 2000s collectible memorabilia on Facebook, horny shipping on Discord, lost
184880	194340	Redditors on the subreddit, tracks from the PTBPOST on YouTube, and places to jam and
194340	196480	support Alter Girl.
196480	199520	Do you know where all these links are?
199520	200560	You do?
200560	204680	Then fucking get in there and get clicky with it.
204680	211000	Then pull a switch and come on down to the Wicky Wicky Wild Wild West and slap a rock
211000	214560	Big Willy style and I don't know man.
214560	221180	This run isn't super fresh, but fuck Will Smith and keep my wife's links in your motherfucking
221180	227680	show notes.
227680	231180	Bienvenidos a venus.
231180	235600	Last time, Julius Summers told Cal and Beck everything.
235600	240660	He gave them the full rundown including a flashback to his high school days.
240660	245100	And then he realized Stevie and Jeremy were there too.
245100	249060	Also Joe made an incredible DMX joke.
249060	253860	Taking us now to the first day of the rest of the can crew's lives.
253860	258620	Now that they know what they know and it's not what they thought.
258620	264740	It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.
279060	302940	Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.
302940	305060	What kind of world are we living in?
305060	309780	What kind of world are we living in?
309780	310780	Us or you?
310780	311780	You.
311780	312780	Got em.
312780	313780	Dude.
313780	314940	Your reality is not the same as my reality.
314940	318060	I reject your reality and substitute my own.
318060	322900	I watched a skater darkly last night.
322900	324940	So.
324940	331380	I watched the Mario movie last night and dude it opened my eyes.
331380	335420	Okay, what's the deal with the Mario movie being unwoke?
335420	336420	Or like anti-woke?
336420	337420	What?
337420	342540	I just heard it was actually funny.
342540	348300	Same thing right?
348300	349300	I don't know.
349300	352940	I just watched it yesterday and there's nothing that sticks out.
352940	354820	Did you look it up on Focus on the Family?
354820	355940	No I did not.
355940	356940	What does it get?
356940	357940	Do you know what that means?
357940	358940	Yes.
358940	359940	Do you remember that?
359940	360940	Did you guys have that?
361500	367980	I never had it but it's occasionally an internet stir every now and then.
367980	372500	I mean it was every movie that came out my mom would look up on that website.
372500	377900	Is it the one that listed every single, it would be an R-rated movie and the list would
377900	385540	be a hundred things and it's like they said the F word, they said damn, they showed someone's
385540	386540	midriff.
387140	392180	Sometimes they would get into really, I don't know who's writing some of these, but really
392180	398660	hot and heavy descriptions of what went down in the film and your boy would just get going
398660	400660	off the line, you know?
400660	404660	Oh no, little Zach can't see this, oh my.
404660	407640	I read Super- Nothing gets me going like stuff that my son
407640	408640	shouldn't see.
408640	412300	Hey you said what kind of world are you living in?
412300	414700	Is there anything else you wanted to say about that Luke?
414860	419780	Well if you have listened to this podcast you might be familiar with the band Dragon
419780	423500	in 3 and Zach was just giving us a little sample.
423500	431660	They got new music, depending on when this comes out their new music is out or their
431660	440420	new music is so close to coming out, so go on Spotify or whatever streaming app that
440420	445500	you use, go to band camp and buy the new Dragon in 3 album.
445500	447140	They have two singles out right now and they're very good.
447140	450540	I just got the new shirt, it rips, it just came in the mail, it's really rad.
450540	451540	Oh that's a bummer.
451540	452540	It rips.
452540	453540	It rips.
453540	454540	It rips.
454540	455540	Yeah, it's a shitty shirt.
455540	459860	It's a bad shirt, but all the best shirts are bad shirts.
459860	464980	Go listen to that and buy their stuff and then there's the other bands too.
464980	465980	Go buy so much stuff.
465980	466980	There's other bands.
466980	467980	There are other bands.
467980	470700	Yeah, support what you like or don't.
470700	472760	Yeah, there's local music around you.
472760	474260	Don't support musicians, support podcasters.
474260	478220	I've heard that it's like, there's loco music around me dude.
478220	484980	There's loco music out there and they don't put out music but like once a year and we're
484980	489340	giving you content every other week here pretending to be people.
489340	490740	Patreon.com slash pretending pod.

500380	502380	In fact, don't even listen to music.
502380	504380	Don't listen to any music.
504380	509420	Cancel your Spotify subscription.
509420	514340	Every time you think you should listen to music, like you're about to be intimate with
514340	515340	your partner.

516340	517340	Yeah.
517340	518340	Just do another re-listen.
518340	519340	Oh my God.
519340	522140	Luke talks about us all being covered in honey at the very beginning.
522540	525260	It's a very sexy podcast.
525260	530900	We're very sexy boys.
530900	535140	I've got a story I've been meaning to tell you guys for two and a half months.
535140	536140	Whoa.
536140	539380	Part of the problem is that we mostly hang out on the pod now.
539380	540380	Unfortunately.
540380	541380	Unfortunately.
541380	544500	Part of the problem is that the times we have hung out, I've been saving this story for
544500	546500	the pod.
546500	549960	And I kept forgetting.
549960	554040	So when we were at the batting cages, you were like, I just want to tell them about
554040	556800	when we were the other day.
556800	558040	See we fucking hang out.
558040	563400	Let's bleep that out so people can't stalk us in our imaginary town.
563400	565080	We only go to two places.
565080	568160	What was I going to say?
568160	569160	Oh no.
569160	571160	We forgot the story.
571160	572160	All right.
572160	573160	Let's get into the app.
573160	574160	It has been two months.
574160	575160	Okay.
575400	580520	My name is, my name is Thomas Cox and I am in a Cox family group chat with my family
580520	583280	and I'm glad this wasn't a confession.
583280	585880	No, it's an anecdote.
585880	592600	Um, the group chat is talking about the time we killed that guy.
592600	594980	I'm like, so yeah, all kinds of things.
594980	601240	Whatever we have to talk about when we killed that guy, succession style on a plane.
601240	608740	This chat gets made in WhatsApp and I realize from day one that you can make the icon anything
608740	610260	you want.
610260	616360	And I think about that for months until I finally pulled the trigger and made it an
616360	618240	eggplant emoji.
618240	621440	Yeah, it's very fitting.
621440	626160	Two mixed, two positive reactions in the group.
626160	627380	Some people thought it was funny.
627380	629380	Some people didn't get it.
629380	635760	One person who really didn't think it was funny was no, in the, in the group chat, one
635760	642000	person who really didn't think it was funny was my dad who got angrier than I've ever
642000	645800	seen him about anything fascinating.
645800	648760	I would have not expected that at all.
648760	650260	I got a text.
650260	655420	He was like, change it back immediately in a text message to me.
655420	663280	And I was, and he was like, people are talking and I go and I go to the group chat and that's
663280	672920	like literally true, but not in the way that is text implied.
672920	674160	They're sending memes.
674160	676560	They're asking about each other's weekends.
676560	682840	And it's at this point I'm still like, I don't realize how upset he is and I'm just like,
682840	684880	I mean, anybody can change it.
684880	686420	You can change it back.
686420	689660	And he's like, I don't know how do it.
689660	691860	Do it now.
691860	696660	For those listening, this is uncharacteristic of his father.
696660	698820	It's pornographic.
698820	700940	No wow.
700940	706500	And I started like after one of his first texts, I started to pull like the chat.
706500	709820	I was like, should we keep it?
709820	710820	Get rid of it.
710820	711820	I don't get it.
711820	717400	That got like about straight evens, like all down.
717400	718400	So what is it now?
718400	731520	Oh, I changed it to a rooster welcome to episode 28 of pretending to be people we've been waiting
731520	736880	two and a half months unwittingly to hear that incredible story.
736880	746300	I'm glad that it got sold though.
746300	747300	God damn.
747300	751660	We told you it was a sexy podcast.
751660	752660	You knew it.
752660	753660	You knew it when you see it.
753660	754660	He knows it.
754660	755660	Yeah.
755660	758020	He knew it cause he saw it.
758020	759900	So we left off with the ex.
759900	761380	My step mom didn't get it.
761380	765980	And then when it got explained to her, she said, all I can say is rude.
765980	766980	Wow.
766980	776800	And then having to get it explained to you though, you're like, that is very vulgar.
776800	777800	It's a wiener joke.
777800	778800	I think my mom would laugh.
778800	779800	Oh, well Mike.
779800	780800	Okay.
780800	785320	My aunt, my cool aunt, she was like, yeah, when I first started at a law firm, uh, this
785320	789420	is like in the late seventies or early eighties, she's like, they put me in the only other
789420	793080	woman together and her last name was Peters.
793580	796140	So their name tag said Cox and Peters.
796140	797140	Nice.
797140	798140	Incredible.
798140	799140	Holy shit.
799140	802020	They should have renamed the firm.
802020	803700	Did they make them partners immediately?
803700	805860	No, this was when they're a very junior.
805860	808380	It was just outside their like office store.
808380	812140	Can we have two characters named butts and craps?
812140	813760	Why?
813760	818020	Two funny words, you know?
818020	819080	Ask an answer.
819080	826100	We left last episode with Beck making an ex going to give it to you, Joe.
826100	834740	Seemingly, but then we realized we hadn't recorded nearly long enough.
834740	837380	We had to come back after we recorded the first time.
837380	840140	It's like, it's not going to do it.
840140	843580	No, we had had a big revelation from your side of the table.
843580	844580	Yeah.
844640	849880	For this episode, a new revelation for everyone.
849880	858400	Luke is actually going to be your handler for this episode and I am going to be playing
858400	859400	Julia Summers.
859400	860400	Stevie.
860400	862400	Joe, do you consent to that?
862400	864000	I don't know if I consent to that.
864000	865000	Please don't.
865000	866000	How prepped are you?
866000	867000	Yeah.
867000	868000	Don't consent.
868000	869000	Please don't.
869420	873780	Now, so you guys are in the Mercedes C class.
873780	881220	You're on a FaceTime with Julia Summers as he wraps up this story about his childhood
881220	891060	and then his future involvement, very vaguely, with a governmental entity of some sort that
891060	898740	exchanges money for jobs with Julia Summers.
898740	899740	An employer?
899740	900740	An employer.
900740	905240	Do you pay taxes?
905240	906240	It's the government.
906240	908240	They take it out already.
908240	911720	Julius, what kind of house do you pull up to?
911720	919640	We're out in one of the suburbs just outside the city and it is like every single house
919640	927640	looks the same, just four colors that change every time and it's like robin egg blue, like
927780	934780	the really light, creamy yellow pink, which it sucks if you got to get the pink one.
934780	935780	Why?
935780	936780	Yeah.
936780	937780	Why?
937780	938780	What kind of pink?
938780	939780	It's hot pink.
939780	940780	It's hot pink.
940780	941780	The others are a nice pastel.
941780	942780	That sounds rad.
942780	943780	Yeah.
943780	949960	And then the fourth one is all those colors stripes.
949960	951400	That's the prized one.
951400	954460	And you pull up in- The Harlequin house.
954460	956620	You pull up to a striped house.
956620	957620	Oh shit.
957620	958620	Nice.
958620	964100	And Julius shuts the FaceTime off and gets out of the car and he's like, sorry, it's
964100	967000	the one they had.
967000	972440	Two car garage, two story house, nothing special about it.
972440	973720	Except it's striped.
973720	977280	Except it's striped, which is yeah, special.
977280	979640	And yeah, you walk in and it's just like white carpet.
979640	984520	Hey Julius, can I bother you for a towel and maybe like some soapy water or something?
984520	988260	I got double sicked on.
988260	989260	Yeah.
989260	990260	Sorry.
990260	993220	Sorry for my role in that, Beck.
993220	994220	It's understandable.
994220	995220	I just want to rinse off.
995220	997660	You threw up on him too?
997660	998660	Damn dude.
998660	1003160	And there's like right next to the entrance is like a little half bathroom and he grabs
1003160	1005620	a towel and some soap.
1005620	1008220	I go in there and just kind of clean up a little.
1008220	1014140	Cal is looking at just the bloody footprints that Julius has left on the white carpet.
1014140	1017520	And when he comes back in, he's like, maybe you should clean up as well.
1017520	1023440	And I think I got some, I got some of my vomit on me too when I, when I found out you were
1023440	1027960	actually an ex file and that faced me as an inescapable truth.
1027960	1031480	My body revolted all over Beck.
1031480	1036120	If you want to clean up, I think there's another bathroom upstairs and you look around and
1036120	1042040	there's like furniture, but there's nothing on the walls that's like not decorated at
1042040	1043040	all.
1043040	1044040	It hardly looks lived in.
1044040	1046300	Do you have a change of clothes here, buddy?
1046300	1047300	Yeah, plenty.
1047300	1048660	Um, you try to fit.
1048660	1050580	Oh no, Cal's like, no, no, no.
1050580	1052940	I have several spare suits in my trunk.
1052940	1057060	I just, Julius, he's like, you meant me.
1057060	1058060	Okay.
1058060	1059380	Um, are you, are you good?
1059380	1060820	I'm going to go change.
1060820	1061820	I'm good.
1061820	1063140	You should definitely go clean up.
1063140	1069020	Julius runs upstairs to his closet filled with monochromatic suits and he puts on a blue
1069020	1071260	one and runs back downstairs.
1071260	1074580	What is Cal Colorado up to?
1074580	1081500	Cal is Ask Jeevesing, uh, X-Files.
1081500	1088320	Cal is Ask Jeevesing, X-Files.
1088320	1093520	If that was the one that won, would you say Ask Jeevesing or Asking Jeeves?
1093520	1094520	Ask Jeevesing.
1094520	1107840	That's what I thought too.
1107840	1108840	What does he see?
1108840	1109840	Ask Jeeves.
1109840	1117200	Um, he gets taken to an IMDB page, but, uh, instantly accepts the prompt to like download
1117200	1120560	the app and he's waiting on that to happen.
1120560	1121560	Okay.
1121560	1125040	So are you heading outside to grab an extra suit to change into?
1125040	1126040	I know.
1126040	1129320	I think he's just at the kitchen sink, like kind of brushing himself off.
1129320	1133420	He just thought he might have to give one to Julius and was preparing himself for that,
1133420	1134420	that reality.
1134420	1135420	And back.
1135420	1136420	What are you up to?
1136420	1139440	Uh, he has dampened a towel and is just wiping his clothes down.
1139440	1144860	So he's got wet spots all over his shorts and shirt, but it's a, it's as clean as it's
1144860	1146480	going to get without being laundered.
1146480	1147480	Okey dokey.
1147480	1155680	Uh, I'm going to need Joe and Luke to leave the room for a moment.
1155680	1156760	Don't go.
1156760	1158040	Don't leave me here with him.
1158040	1159040	Good luck.
1159040	1160040	You're in the kitchen.
1160040	1161040	Yeah.
1161040	1162040	Which I assume.
1162040	1163040	I, okay.
1163040	1167240	So I was assuming is this like a small living room, kitchen open kind of thing?
1167240	1168240	Yeah.
1168240	1169240	Yeah.
1169240	1175320	And you hear, uh, someone coming down the stairs and assume it's probably Julius as
1175320	1179360	he was the one who went up there and Julius, that was fast.
1179360	1187960	And as you look over your shoulder, you turn and see a woman in a black suit, the white
1187960	1195720	shirt, and you recognize her immediately by the tattoo that is running out of her sleeve
1195720	1203280	down her hand of a tail of some sort, like a scaly tail.
1203280	1210480	And you flash back to a moment the other night on the bridge, the city bridge, when you ran
1210480	1219080	into a very powerful woman who told you that you needed to get off the bridge and get back
1219080	1220360	where I once belonged.
1220360	1225320	Where you once belonged.
1225320	1233400	But you remember the feeling of being smitten and it is mixed with surprise.
1233400	1236680	Oh, hello.
1236680	1237680	Hello there.
1237680	1240040	I, I thought you were Julius.
1240040	1243600	No, I am very much not.
1243600	1245680	Oh, hello.
1245680	1247480	Um, you may not remember me.
1247480	1248800	I'm Cal Colorado.
1248800	1249800	We met on the bridge.
1249800	1252560	Yes, of course, Mr. Colorado.
1252560	1255080	I know exactly who you are.
1255080	1256520	Um, yeah.
1256520	1258720	I don't think I caught your name.
1258720	1260800	No, you didn't.
1260800	1269880	And she turns and she walks to the bar next to you and swiftly makes a Manhattan.
1269880	1271380	What time is it?
1271380	1274160	It's night tool time.
1274160	1277160	Cool.
1277160	1281640	Famous mugshot.
1281640	1283840	Are you, are you X?
1283880	1286480	I am Santa Claus.
1286480	1287880	I'm X.
1287880	1291920	I'm I am who you say I am.
1291920	1296860	Cal kind of gets over his initial like shock and confusion and, um, remembers what they're
1296860	1297860	there for.
1297860	1299640	And he's like, do you have the footage?
1299640	1300640	Yes.
1300640	1301640	That's wonderful.
1301640	1302640	I'll take that.
1302640	1305680	Yes, you will.
1305680	1308440	After a bit of a conversation.
1308440	1314520	And at that moment you hear back coming out of the bathroom and joyous popping downstairs.
1314520	1319680	Oh boys, lover boy.
1319680	1326480	And if he still doesn't answer, it was easier to bird him.
1326480	1327480	Dude.
1327480	1328480	It's so scary.
1328480	1329480	He didn't find that at red racks.
1329480	1330480	He made that for you.
1330480	1338040	I actually just woke up and it was like, and I can just tell you, it was like, it was like,
1338040	1339720	and I can just hear the words in my mind.
1339720	1340840	Give me this.
1340840	1344600	We're going to post a picture of the president.
1344600	1351880	Luke got me for my birthday on the social media, which is at pretending pod on Instagram
1351880	1354080	and Twitter and pretending to be people on Facebook.
1354080	1355080	Wow.
1355080	1357760	I couldn't have said that less emotion.
1357760	1358760	Thank you.
1358760	1359760	Tell me.
1359760	1365080	Well, it's because you're actively having your soul sucked out of you while you stare
1365080	1367760	at this crazy rabbit.
1367760	1374960	You got me a rabbit and the longer you look at it, the broader it's smile becomes growing
1374960	1375960	more power.
1375960	1376960	Oh God.
1376960	1384080	You didn't tell me you already have one of those.
1384080	1385080	So it's a rabbit.
1385080	1386840	It's standing up right on two legs.
1386840	1389040	It's very humanoid.
1389040	1396080	But it does not, it has three toe pot pot toes and it's got three paw fingers, but it
1396080	1401920	is wearing pants and an overcoat and a scarf and it's sinister.
1401920	1403400	Is it sinister looking?
1403400	1410760	Let me see the scarf as an untied tie, like wide and 30 style, but it may be a scarf.
1410760	1412020	They're both very creepy.
1412020	1414100	Also he moves head.
1414100	1416520	He moves a little bit.
1416520	1417520	That's not okay.
1417520	1418600	Do it back and forth.
1418600	1421880	He's pretty bendy back and forth.
1421880	1427480	He can do anything.
1427480	1428480	Wait, hold on.
1428480	1429480	Does that mean he can do?
1429480	1430480	Oh, okay.
1430480	1431480	Wow.
1431480	1437240	He was behind the laptop, so I thought you were making him type and then I looked.
1437240	1439240	He wasn't making him type.
1439240	1442520	Nope, but apparently he's Zach's type.
1442520	1444960	What's his name?
1444960	1445960	Jack.
1446360	1447360	Jack.
1447360	1449540	His name is Jack.
1449540	1454040	For sure his name is Jack based on literally everything about him.
1454040	1456880	That's the Jackalope that Beck fell on.
1456880	1457880	His horns came off.
1457880	1458880	I'm having flashbacks.
1458880	1460960	Just looking into his eyes.
1460960	1462320	He is looking right at us.
1462320	1468560	Flashing back into the home of Julius Summers and his roommate.
1468560	1473920	Beck, you're popping out of the bathroom, a little refreshed.
1473920	1474920	Half bath refreshed.
1475920	1478320	It's a specific type of refreshment.
1478320	1481880	Julius is coming down in equal parts time.
1481880	1483520	And half bath?
1483520	1485800	I think you meant without a toilet, right?
1485800	1493960	That is without a toilet, yes, just a shower.
1493960	1494960	You walk in.
1494960	1495960	There's a four-
1495960	1497560	Oh yeah, go wash off in the tub room.
1497560	1499040	There's a four foot tub.
1499040	1502960	The whole room is a shower, but there's also a bathtub and a sink in there.
1502960	1504020	It's wild, man.
1504120	1507900	When my grandma was like 93, she was like, yeah, I've been taking a lot of airplane showers.
1507900	1508900	Do you know what that is?
1508900	1509900	And I was like, no.
1509900	1514860	And she goes, just wings and tail section.
1514860	1516140	That's awful.
1516140	1518100	It's also pretty practical.
1518100	1519740	Oh no.
1519740	1526600	Yeah, Julius is, you see him coming down the stairs, fresh clean suit, still covered in
1526600	1529060	blood on his skin.
1529060	1530320	Why?
1530320	1532980	He did not wash his face off.
1533980	1538740	Beck, when you pop out of the bathroom, Joyce is coming down the stairs at the exact same
1538740	1539740	time.
1539740	1540740	Please roll grip.
1543100	1544500	It's a fail.
1544500	1550700	I believe that you are just going to lose one grip here, as this has happened before
1550700	1553820	and you have found a way to deal with it.
1553820	1556700	You've learned, but it's still going to grab you for a moment.
1556700	1560220	I come around the corner and kind of almost bump into you.
1560220	1561220	Oh, Julius.
1561220	1562220	Hey.
1562460	1566100	And Beck is suddenly kind of looking down at his feet.
1566100	1569900	Hey man, uh, why don't we go like no coats today?
1569900	1572740	Like that'd be like, uh, like it's nice out.
1572740	1575020	Would that be, that'd be cool?
1575020	1576020	Sure.
1576020	1577020	Yeah.
1577020	1583020	I, uh, he takes his jacket off and he's wearing like a, just a short sleeve t-shirt under
1583020	1584020	that.
1584020	1587940	And he sees blood all over him and he's like, oh yeah, sorry, I'm going to go wash up.
1587940	1588940	Cool, cool, cool.
1588940	1589940	Right on man.
1589940	1590940	Right on.
1590980	1595980	Into the half bath and turns the water on.
1595980	1600540	Luke, leave the room.
1600540	1603540	This is hilarious.
1603540	1608220	It's a cleaning episode.
1608220	1613860	We couldn't just cut to the next fucking scene because the way we've always role played.
1613860	1618940	Not enough role playing podcasts place proper emphasis on hygiene.
1618940	1620540	We shit on this podcast.
1620540	1622140	We eat on this podcast.
1622140	1623860	We love on this podcast.
1623860	1625860	God damn it.
1625860	1631700	Um, uh, uh, Beck, uh, this is, this is X.
1631700	1633020	Oh hello.
1633020	1640780	And you see a woman, uh, in a black suit and white shirt and you recognize the tattoo running
1640780	1642300	out of her sleeve.
1642300	1643300	Oh shit.
1643300	1644940	You might remember her from the bridge.
1644940	1645940	Oh yeah.
1645940	1648260	You were, you were at the hole.
1648260	1649260	Yes.
1649260	1650260	That was.
1650260	1651260	You remember us?
1651260	1652260	We were there too.
1652260	1653260	Shh.
1653260	1654260	Did you see it?
1654260	1655260	Incredible.
1655260	1656260	Wow.
1656260	1662540	It was, it was, um, well you kind of ran us out of there before we got to see much.
1662540	1663580	What did you see?
1663580	1666060	Did you see the whole thing?
1666060	1667060	No pun intended.
1667060	1668140	It was a good one though.
1668140	1669140	She smiles.
1669140	1670140	Yeah.
1670140	1671140	We saw.
1671140	1672140	Hmm.
1672140	1675140	Did you see how smooth it was?
1675140	1676140	Yeah.
1676140	1679180	It was, it was pretty smooth where it was weird.
1679180	1680180	Yeah.
1680180	1682700	It was very weird.
1682700	1685140	Have you been in this line of work a long time?
1685140	1686140	Yes.
1686140	1687900	Yes I have.
1687900	1691940	Did you become Julius's mom after you guys abducted him?
1691940	1692940	No.
1692940	1694880	How would you like describe your relationship with him?
1694880	1695880	Are you like his boss?
1695880	1696880	Yeah.
1696880	1697880	Are you like his boss?
1697880	1702100	That's the exact question I wanted to ask because can you talk to him about like the
1702100	1703100	blood thing?
1703100	1704100	Oh yes.
1704100	1709020	Well it seemed like he was going to go clean off so hopefully he does.
1709020	1712140	What do you make of the fact that he didn't?
1712140	1720860	In our line of work people often end up in situations where they don't enjoy certain
1720860	1722060	things.
1722060	1724060	Normal activities.
1724060	1730220	For instance, I don't know if you noticed but when your camera man here was walking
1730220	1737260	up he got super fucking weird about Mr. Summers wearing a coat.
1737260	1738260	Is that right?
1738500	1740580	No, he got weird because he was covered in blood.
1740580	1741980	And he was wearing a coat too.
1741980	1745700	He's always had the coat thing as long as I've known back he's had that coat thing
1745700	1746700	I think.
1746700	1750660	So I'm just saying that's- Wait you don't think he's taking a bath in
1750660	1751660	there do you?
1751660	1753660	I hope not.
1753660	1756320	Me too.
1756320	1758300	So you kind of did avoid our question though.
1758300	1759300	Are you his boss?
1759300	1760840	Or like his partner maybe?
1760840	1762460	Like what is your like hierarchy?
1762460	1764820	Uh yeah boss sure.
1764820	1767020	Did you put him on cam?
1767020	1768020	Yeah.
1768780	1773340	Well that that was why we utilized Agent Summers yeah.
1773340	1775980	Did you mean to get us involved or was that like an accident?
1775980	1777620	Oh total accident.
1777620	1784020	I did not know that things were going to progress so quickly and she looks over her shoulder
1784020	1791740	and the very very quiet quiet the very very quiet Stevie and Jeremy who are sitting on
1791740	1797660	the couch over in the living room and she kind of pees at them and she's like yes I
1797660	1805660	didn't know that certain people would be involved and I didn't know that more people
1805660	1806660	would be involved.
1806660	1811140	Yeah no I had no idea that things would things would get out of hand this fast.
1811140	1813940	Did you send us the pin that told us where to go?
1813940	1814940	Real quick.
1814940	1817940	Roll human for me.
1817940	1821300	Twenty four on a seventy.
1821300	1824240	Eighty six on a forty.
1824240	1827460	Joe go la la.
1827460	1831380	Thomas she's smiling super fucking big when she says that things got out of hand really
1831380	1835860	fast like this is exactly what she wants.
1835860	1836860	You're back Joe.
1836860	1837860	Hello.
1837860	1838860	Hello.
1838860	1841340	I uh I lean over and whisper in Bec's ear.
1841340	1842340	Nice.
1842340	1843340	Watch your back with this one.
1843340	1847140	I don't know if she's a friend of journalism.
1847140	1849340	Okay okay.
1849340	1851900	So what's the plan?
1851900	1854100	How do we roll it out?
1854100	1858980	Well uh you said you would give us the footage.
1858980	1860740	Sure but we need a game plan.
1860740	1865400	Are you going to put it all out there at once or are we going to slowly kind of you know
1865400	1870620	divvy it out to the people that way we can kind of move you up uh I heard that there
1870620	1877380	have been some openings at City Action News we can probably get you wherever you need
1877380	1882820	to be to make sure this story is out there in the open and getting the traction it deserves.
1882820	1887140	I turned down a very similar offer from a dead man not hours ago.
1887140	1896820	Was the offer to tell the story that you want to tell or was it to cover the ass of the
1896820	1897820	Godel company?
1897820	1905780	So here's how I see it a three-night event Cal Colorado trapped in the it bit.
1905780	1907340	Bec is nodding vigorously.
1907340	1908340	She's loving it.
1908340	1912740	And then I think you know like well obviously type's position is open and uh in the dead
1912740	1917200	ball days back in the 20s and such it wasn't uncommon for there to be a player manager
1917200	1923400	of sorts so I could I could I could steer the direction of canoes towards towards the
1923400	1926340	truth towards telling people what's really good.
1926340	1931380	Not lead perhaps I think I'd still do my uh little Cal stories I kind of like these.
1931380	1933100	Oh growth.
1933100	1938260	We had an incident with our editor where like they kind of like went a little crazy after
1938260	1941140	seeing the footage so we all kind of talked about that we would kind of drip feed the
1941140	1943980	footage a little slowly.
1943980	1946900	Yes we have uh nab terror.
1946900	1947900	You've pardon?
1947900	1948900	Yes.
1948900	1960860	Like uh in a pp or in a bb bb okay as in boy boy yeah um that one's still pretty concerning
1960860	1961860	though.
1961860	1967140	Great yeah yeah obviously if I step into this kind of position I will be sort of you know
1967140	1972340	I'm all I would need to report these sort of things to HR and I have a therapy consult
1972340	1985140	with someone who understands human role six which is of course easily contested yeah no
1985140	1991420	you're on board she's she's telling the truth why wouldn't they want to get someone that
1991420	1996780	understands and that they can keep the secret yeah we just need them to like get it out
1996780	2001660	right they blurt it out and then uh they've told someone they feel good about it and then
2001660	2006520	they can go back to their lives and kind of we help set them straight so they can go back
2006520	2013780	to their lives this isn't like a you're not sending them off to Siberia no no not Siberia
2013780	2014780	no.
2015140	2021700	Hold on though I mean after the story gets out the full story on day three everybody
2021700	2030580	will know yes absolutely so what's the point that's my question yes so we agree uh no no
2030580	2035460	I don't think we do what's the point of uh until we get this thing out there do you want
2035460	2042100	her to just be grieving this loss of reality she should be speaking to someone and getting
2042100	2046700	the treatment that she needs I guess we do need to keep a lid on her until the story
2046700	2050860	fully breaks but once it fully breaks like everybody's gonna be able to talk to each
2050860	2056900	other about it like it's not right so then they'll be able to go on 72 hours of pain
2056900	2064660	is that not mean anything to you yeah yeah that sounds pretty fucking significant from
2064660	2071140	a story perspective I would like to human that and see how significantly uh Cal takes
2071140	2076820	it I mean or whatever she's talking about Vivica like being in pain for 72 hours before
2076820	2083500	the story breaks oh I thought you meant inflicting 72 hours of like psychic torture on the people
2083500	2090900	of the world with this new story you have you have this whole thing so wrong well Julius'
2090900	2095980	story was pretty disturbing of how he came into your organization oh well that was the
2095980	2102300	fucking 90s or whatever right like how old is he not that old oh right he's only like
2102300	2110080	29 so that was like the oh that was the tens that was those were worse than the 90s everyone
2110080	2115240	was listening to arcade fire I'll have to take your word for it have you heard the blues
2115240	2120260	brothers soundtracks I feel like I should go check on Julius he's been out there for
2120260	2131260	a while yeah let's all weird that he's doing check on them I just got really into it it
2131260	2137620	was yeah it was fun it's getting weird it's getting weird you guys are paranoid well this
2137620	2152940	lady is scary you hear me knock on the bathroom door you get behind the ears bud yeah Luke let
2152940	2158460	me get a quick five to ten with Luke what did you say get behind the ears bud oh but I thought
2158460	2168620	he said God I was like what happened back loss is fucking mine see you so soon oh I won't forget
2168620	2175060	this time I promise sorry Luke I totally forgot about what you I was just in the roleplay and I
2175060	2181660	feel yeah you were cleaning yourself for a good long while I wonder why it took so long roll grip
2181660	2191420	roll grip motherfucker all eight I pass oh shit so he turns on the water you you look at it and
2191420	2201100	as you look at it you start smelling sailing can you almost start hearing this is that a voice in
2201100	2208660	your head and then it just what do you think about to just like push this away clean up clean up
2208700	2214100	everybody do you share clean up and he starts washing his hands and like washing the blood
2214100	2221540	off his arms and face eyes closed yeah and he Luke is currently at washing his body washing
2221540	2227380	his face washing everywhere where blood got on it and then he wipes his eyes and looks at himself
2227580	2240940	in the mirror and that does not pass that's a 60 on a 23 for those of you who are averse to bodily
2240940	2254740	mutilation I would advise skip a little bit skip for it a little bit here as Julius looks into the
2254740	2262900	mirror the scent of sailing has just kind of passed and he looks and the blood's gone but
2262900	2273180	that's not your face that's not Julius no what face is it not Julius is okay so Julius sees
2273180	2280380	Julius but like to him it's just off it's not really not him it's like if you saw like a really
2280380	2290340	good wax figure of yourself oh fuck that no and so he's like trends like and he's like kind of
2290340	2295460	wiping at his face you know that you're feeling like this but you're looking at yourself in the
2295460	2302340	mirror and you are smiling back at yourself at Julius wipes harder and harder and harder and
2302340	2308300	nothing's coming off and he smiles getting bigger he looks underneath the sink that he's using and
2308300	2318900	he opens it up and he grabs out like a bristle brush for cleaning and he just keeps scrubbing
2318900	2323860	and scrubbing all over and he's he throws it down and he's trying to like get his fingernail
2323860	2329540	underneath the skin on his jaw and just trying to get under there and start peeling and at that
2329540	2340540	moment you hear and Julius starts scrubbing behind the ears and then he puts the brush
2340540	2352260	down and just leaves the bathroom damn dude that was intense how fucked up is he so fucked up man
2352260	2358980	like literally I mean imagine that you took did that yeah dude those bristles like it's not a big
2358980	2366220	thing but if you rub hard skin over and over and over for minutes like for your face skin pretty
2366220	2374780	deep scratches yeah it looks like you got clawed by one of those like light up toys that they give
2374780	2382180	kids at amusement parks that has like all of those long strands that come together at the end it's
2382180	2389660	just like one of those came alive was very angry and fucked you up or a toilet brush or toilet
2389660	2410100	brush bird bird bird bird you holler something about the ears you get behind the ears water still
2410300	2418940	running shuts off and then turning the corner you see Julius Summers with scratches all over
2418940	2427380	one side of his face oh shit how deep well you see in his hand like scrubby brush that uses a clean
2427380	2434380	like the sink or you know similar to a toilet brush but it's not the toilet brush and there's
2434940	2442420	bloody oh you really did get like really hard behind the ears man Beck wants to grab a towel
2442420	2447540	and maybe are they bleeding are you bleeding actively bleeding from just a little bit maybe
2447540	2452380	just like a little trickles here and there yeah beating up but there's scratches all over a tiny
2452380	2458420	little scratches out like takes the scrubby from your hand if you're like if you're just holding it
2458420	2464820	oh yeah sorry Cal whips around at X and he's like this isn't just the fucking jacket thing oh
2464820	2472140	hey he sees X isn't you know this isn't like if I saw you know this isn't this isn't just some
2472140	2481040	little deal he's hurting himself she turns around and grabs a glass off the counter and turns on the
2481040	2486580	faucet to pour herself a glass of water I'm cool with that it's just a little glass it's not like
2486580	2494420	the tub or anything oh good 20 he's fine it's just a little glass she turns around takes a big
2494420	2509740	oh 65 not not a pass and Julius just is frozen staring off into space lose one Beck you're
2509740	2521020	noticing as Cal is in this confrontation with this suited woman she takes a big gulp we all do
2521020	2530260	what we do in the service of making this world a better place by shining a light of truth out into
2530260	2535460	the world is that not correct mr. Colorado that's what I do I don't know what the hell this is
2535660	2543660	unfortunately for everyone there are things in this world that do not act according to the
2543660	2550660	nature that we were once taught they are happening more frequently and they are affecting our world
2550660	2558660	at large I need you to understand this before we move forward I need you to understand this
2558660	2571180	now she's a cat lady my experience those things are mostly people you seem like one of them I am
2571180	2587620	on your side we are on your side human pass for cow not pass for Beck 67 on a 40 yeah I mean it's
2587620	2596300	pretty straightforward here she is absolutely lying to you however for this project this
2596300	2607180	situation my current objective is to out the truth on the Godel company to show the world that things
2607180	2618180	unnatural to our world are happening at their behest I want that to be known do you want that
2618180	2623500	to be known as well for the first time Cal is questioning that when he hears the way she's
2623500	2638180	talking about it okay so give us our footage and we'll take our friend and we'll get out of here
2638180	2645940	and run the story I also want that to happen and good that's great so let's just do that it's going
2645940	2656540	to take a day or two to get things in order as far as she looks at Julius she looks back at the
2656540	2663700	two of you you know the murder oh are you gonna nab him no no no no no oh right you killed type
2663700	2676980	and two other people not people just cops that's right oh all cops are gaskards after we're done
2676980	2686060	here can we talk about the promotion absolutely two of them two of them the footage is right there
2686060	2691900	she points to the couch and you do see like on the other side of the couch there's a duffel bag
2691900	2698460	that goes over to get it and grabs it yep the footage is inside it seems to all be there is
2698460	2704180	it the stuff I mean it looks like it is it my hard drive is it the one that was stolen from my
2704180	2711380	pocket or did is it copied no no it is yours yeah it's my it's my hard drive at least I have to plug
2711380	2720540	it in see if it's there my drives hard hot damn back when you look down at your hand with the
2720580	2727980	phone drive in it there's blood on your hand from where you grab the bag when you unzipped it oh
2727980	2736140	gross this is he's holding up the hand this is this is one of the cops I assume real grip
2736140	2749660	that's a hot one I looked I'm like is that 60 I can't tell if this is a one but it is a one
2749980	2758380	dude I gained one grip how have your objectives changed in the world getting the footage back
2758380	2764300	probably it feels probably really good to back like this was that's I mean that's his footage
2764300	2770980	that's always been a thing now that we've got some it seems like backup in this whole thing with X I
2770980	2778140	think that he feels like we're untouchable we're doing we're back on the right track when Beck is
2778140	2787860	holding up his bloody hand this is like at any cost right Beck Beck cautiously nods yeah I mean
2787860	2794300	yeah you gotta break a few eggs to make omelet right cow just kind of looks down at the ground
2794300	2803180	yeah back and I think we can agree we got some bad eggs in the city yeah yeah bad eggs she reaches
2803180	2815500	her hand out to Cal Colorado agent Diggory Cal Colorado go make some news mr. Colorado in 48
2815500	2822660	hours okay yeah the producer job will be yours just walk on in as if it is that you mean mine
2822660	2831820	and he's the anchor Oh Julius type said I could have it oh yeah I'm really sorry Julius but your
2831820	2838300	boss here just promised it to me you could be you could be anchor I was just gonna do kind of
2838300	2843620	a you want me to be the anchor whatever no no probably I don't actually since I'll be producer
2843620	2849780	I've never heard you talk about wanting to be a producer before well I could direct the network
2849780	2855620	to a more just and and and truthful vision of the world I could I could put what's really important
2855620	2867020	on there okay Julius remembers that he's only cared about this literally for like a week
2867020	2888620	then it settled we avoided potentially months of in real time Julius thinks about like about
2888620	2895220	arguing and then things about killing goffs and how it was pretty sick to do that and he's like
2895580	2903300	priorities but could we could we talk a minute just just you and me yeah what you got by the way
2903300	2908900	congrats on the promotion well you know nothing's final yet I guess we'll know in 48 hours but it
2908900	2913140	feels good right yeah I mean well it actually kind of feels real bad it's kind of a bummer
2913140	2920500	that that's kind of what I want to talk well we just had a little scare yeah we thought we lost
2920500	2930940	that whole episode which was we were the ones experiencing the horror podcast I lost so much
2930940	2940540	grip my face turned white then we went into our handy friend the internet and the first thing we
2940540	2947140	heard from a man on YouTube was this is why when and then he said the exact thing that happened to
2947140	2962100	us happens I don't freak out and it made us all feel and then Thomas embraced yeah with fervor
2962100	2968380	which was good because my girlfriend has been telling me I need to hug my friends because I
2968380	2976220	want like you want too much yeah well you can squeeze me baby I need you need squeezes I'm
2976220	2985300	gonna squeeze you all tonight I need Thomas so you were just pulling a sorry Cal Colorado
2985300	2992100	was just pulling back wilder aside so we had Luke leave the room yeah congrats on the promotion
2992100	3000740	dude it doesn't actually I was gonna start at a different spot okay that's kind of what I wanted
3000740	3006420	to talk to you about so it doesn't really feel great like does it it's kind of it's bittersweet
3006420	3014980	like you don't really film producers very often I don't know if we're gonna be like oh Beck you'll
3014980	3021340	don't worry about that listen we have a lot of time to talk about where you'll be in this
3021340	3026220	organization but doesn't it kind of seem weird what's going on here like does it seem like
3026980	3032020	doesn't seem like me like it's kind of scary when she talks about how much she wants this stuff to
3032020	3035740	happen and it doesn't really feel like it feels like maybe this is some sort of splinter group
3035740	3041700	from the other group that abducted him is maybe the vibe I'm getting like I think she's rogue oh
3041700	3048460	dude I did not even think about that I she is cold that's for sure but at the end of the day
3048460	3052820	she wants to show the footage right and that's what we want what if it's what if it's too powerful
3053140	3059660	I mean yeah for sure we I think we kind of did this conversation back with Vivica we just we
3059660	3064300	were gonna try and do it slower this time you thinking we shouldn't do it at all dude we've
3064300	3072420	got the footage now we can protect it we've got 48 hours to decide and and see what Julius and his
3072420	3079500	people want from it if we can yeah we're investigative journalists let's investigate we play
3079500	3084340	it close to the chest I'm good with that it's best but no it's like you hold your cards up
3084340	3089220	really close to your chest so nobody can see Oh Beck people tell me I should correct less
3089220	3104620	anyway yeah I think we're on the same page take it slow we'll take it slow that was fucking
3104620	3116900	masterful yeah that was I'm really glad you dropped that holy shit okay let's play it cool
3116900	3125220	and they I like Cal turns around and awkwardly winks at Julius whose face is just like dripping
3125220	3138700	with blood next let's get him back on Ian hello hello is it me you're looking for no I've peed
3138700	3151780	now several times I do not have to pee anymore tonight Julius Julius has been just looking off
3151780	3159780	kind of not paying attention for a minute suddenly Cal Colorado turns back and looks at you and you
3159780	3168900	kind of notice and then he gives you a wink yeah and Julius winks back Cal turns back he's like oh
3168900	3174320	I think I think he thinks I'm flirting with him yeah it was kind of weird to return the
3174960	3187240	yeah I kind of that's the vibe I got Julius hi no Julius says that to Cal oh yeah okay um I have
3187240	3200800	a powerful natural charisma they can be mistaken anyway I'm just saying don't worry Julius it
3200800	3207960	happens all the time I've seen it dozens of times what are we gonna do to until we can put it on the
3207960	3212840	news there's the question well that's that's the good thing Julius now that we've secured the
3212840	3218240	footage you can come with us to the hospital and nobody has to split up we'll stay right there with
3218240	3225760	you in the room yeah I guess I mean I don't really don't really want to go back but two days in a
3225760	3231160	hospital it's one night for your own good dude yeah you're kind of beat up right now it was
3231160	3237880	pretty amazing what Stevie managed to do with a target first-aid kit and some old fast-food
3237880	3244840	napkins but I think a doctor should look at that gunshot wound yeah and he like kind of touched it
3244840	3253960	and it hurts yeah we can talk about how we want to edit it yeah we can talk about that I'm sleepy
3253960	3265280	Zach just made a lot of rolls do you guys hear that it sounds like God's trying to make a
3265280	3275720	decision now he's just rolling the psychos out I need everyone to roll alertness pass I pass
3276120	3283480	without cow fails what do you pass with 15 52 Luke not a big deal you just see Stevie
3283480	3292320	got a little walking out of the house nope and Julius pulls out a gun and aims it Adam
3292320	3298640	and they hold their hands just like straight up in the air and they're like what do you think I'm
3298640	3304680	gonna let a god will get away in the middle of all this okay Cal jumps in front of Stevie it's
3304680	3312640	fucking hot I was trying you I was gonna smoke it's like too much this is all like this is a
3312640	3318240	lot I was gonna smoke does anyone want to smoke with me outside Cal turns his back to Julius
3318240	3325840	Thomas and I are both holding our hands and it's facing Stevie and he's like he looks really hard
3325840	3333320	into her eyes it's like remember what we talked about Stevie it's up to you you don't have to
3333320	3341680	be a bad God I don't know what you're trying to do sneaking away you should stick with us
3341680	3352960	roll persuade with a plus 20 46 something kind of shifts in their eyes I don't know how to say
3352960	3370320	this I've never trusted anyone before that makes sense and I do now yeah I'm in Beck nods Adam
3370320	3376520	kind of off to the side cow bursts into tears
3400320	3423600	my life is great and it makes me think my whole body is gonna go over with it yeah what was that
