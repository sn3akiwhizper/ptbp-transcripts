00:00.000 --> 00:02.340
Slip in some slop, y'all.

00:02.340 --> 00:14.080
It's Wolf the Dog, the DJ Supreme from the radio station formerly and currently known as 694.2 PTBP.

00:14.080 --> 00:21.540
And I am here to give your ears a little butterfly kiss, but with my vocal cords.

00:21.540 --> 00:28.360
And speaking of things that are right, this Howlin' with Wolf is from Harley in Southampton, England,

00:28.360 --> 00:31.800
who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod,

00:31.800 --> 00:39.720
a worthwhile thing you can do, too, regardless of if you have a cool name and or are from a cool port city.

00:39.720 --> 00:44.680
You can still share the new promo video and tag at Pretending Pod.

00:44.680 --> 00:47.640
Harley from Southampton, England writes,

00:58.360 --> 01:07.720
And scrubbing Luz seems a bit less daunting while I have Keith Beans being an absolute mess in my headphones.

01:07.720 --> 01:15.800
Sometimes I do get strange looks when I start laughing out loud in the middle of a shift, but it's a small price to pay.

01:15.800 --> 01:19.480
Keep it up, guys. You make a lot of people really happy.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.880
And Wolf, keep on howlin'.

01:21.880 --> 01:26.600
I look forward to your dulcet tones at the start of every episode.

01:26.600 --> 01:36.120
Oh, and a look out for my upcoming post-apocalyptic gamebook, I guess, with Savage Realms gamebooks?

01:36.120 --> 01:41.400
Love, Harley from Southampton, England, xxx.

01:41.400 --> 01:46.200
Now, Harley, did you give ol' Wolfy an owoo?

01:46.200 --> 01:49.960
Owooooo!

01:49.960 --> 01:55.400
My lord, do I love a good howl with me, Wolf.

01:55.400 --> 02:00.760
Thanks for the kind words, especially the ones that are about yours truly.

02:00.760 --> 02:08.840
If you want to write up something for your slippy, sloppy wolf to howl, just tag at Pretending Pod on Twitter or Instagram,

02:08.840 --> 02:15.160
tag Pretending To Be People on Facebook, and tag user slash Pretending To Be People on Reddit.

02:15.160 --> 02:23.960
Or write a five-star review on the podcast app of your choice and get that delicious evidence before my sloppy wet eyes.

02:23.960 --> 02:27.560
And it's never been easier to share something around,

02:27.560 --> 02:35.400
because Pretending To Be People collabed with a wildly talented film production team called Mood Ring Films.

02:35.400 --> 02:44.600
And together, they created a promo video that turned out well beyond the PTBP crew's most auspicious dreams.

02:44.600 --> 02:49.560
So just, uh, share that, and tag at Pretending Pod, and you're good to go.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.760
You can, uh, you can do that now. Go on, I'll wait.

02:52.760 --> 02:57.240
Oh, you need the link. That's what you're telling me. Well, guess where the link is.

02:57.240 --> 03:01.720
That's right, the links are in the show notes.

03:01.720 --> 03:05.400
Pretty cool news about that promo video, huh?

03:05.400 --> 03:08.600
And that weren't even the news.

03:08.600 --> 03:17.240
Last time, Cal Colorado smelled a smeared waxy substance left behind at the scene at the Zeitgeist.

03:17.240 --> 03:22.200
And he determined that it smelled like some moron's earwax,

03:22.280 --> 03:28.600
which was an enormous letdown, given that Julius and Stevie said they smelled God.

03:28.600 --> 03:34.520
And Beck claimed he saw visions of the wet energy and the lightning tornado.

03:34.520 --> 03:40.920
After another round of sniffs, Beck witnessed even more unnatural activity.

03:40.920 --> 03:47.480
Julius saw a blood moat above train tracks in the upside-down church in Grover's Gorge.

03:47.480 --> 03:50.600
And Cal smelled earwax again.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.200
Oh, what? Hold on there.

03:52.200 --> 03:56.600
Being handed a note by my producer, which is frankly horrible.

03:56.600 --> 04:00.520
Terrible smell, cold hand. Five stars.

04:00.520 --> 04:08.360
The note says that Thomas just released the finale of his Oops All Pettymores campaign over on the Patreon.

04:08.360 --> 04:13.560
That's right, all six parts of The Lost Treasure of John Lee Pettymore,

04:13.560 --> 04:20.120
including the two-part finale, part six, part one, and part six, part two,

04:20.200 --> 04:28.200
are now available in edited audio format at patreon.com slash pretending pod.

04:28.200 --> 04:32.120
And these were edited by the Thomas himself.

04:32.120 --> 04:36.120
And let me just say, pretty solid work there, Thomas.

04:36.120 --> 04:37.720
Well done, boy.

04:39.160 --> 04:45.000
So if you want to listen to the six part seven episode scenario that Thomas ran,

04:45.000 --> 04:49.880
which is a wild continuation of a region of contention story,

04:49.880 --> 04:54.520
you can get access for five bucks, five US dollars.

04:54.520 --> 04:59.640
And you can watch the very strange, sometimes partially cosplayed,

04:59.640 --> 05:07.560
VOD BTS streams of the Patreon recording process for fifteen dollars.

05:07.560 --> 05:12.840
Which just so happens to be the cost of a nice lunch sometimes, which is nice.

05:12.840 --> 05:19.480
But this is like hours upon hours of nasty streams from these dudes at their weirdest.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.320
Anyway, check it on out.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.720
It's a solid little horrible story.

05:24.280 --> 05:27.480
Now you know I'm not gonna say where the links are.

05:27.480 --> 05:31.160
You're gonna say it in your head in this moment of silence.

05:32.920 --> 05:39.240
The word segue looks like you should say it seg, which is the singular of sex.

05:39.240 --> 05:44.200
Last thing, if you want to submit your interpretation of the wet energy,

05:44.200 --> 05:49.080
or the lightning tornado, or the blood moat in the upside down church,

05:49.080 --> 05:55.640
in the ongoing fan art contest slash drawing, you have until July 14th to enter.

05:55.640 --> 06:02.840
We got some incredible work so far from illustrations, to fanfic, to an original song,

06:02.840 --> 06:04.920
to even embroidery.

06:04.920 --> 06:07.400
And we're just beside ourselves.

06:07.400 --> 06:11.960
And if you need some more ideas, no one has sent in cosplay,

06:11.960 --> 06:16.920
or a recreation of the sitting while walking dance from the calzone.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.920
And I sure would like to laugh at that.

06:20.600 --> 06:21.800
Just the idea.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.320
Damn, that's silly.

06:23.320 --> 06:29.160
But really, it's time for a hot new ditty that'll make you huff and puff, daddy.

06:29.160 --> 06:34.760
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

06:46.920 --> 07:00.760
Because my life is great and it's all my fault.

07:13.800 --> 07:14.440
Good energy.

07:16.920 --> 07:20.200
What else we got?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.200
What else we got?

07:26.920 --> 07:28.280
How about them cardinals?

07:28.280 --> 07:29.640
Man, pretty mixed bag.

07:30.760 --> 07:34.360
I just opened up an orange filled with tiny products.

07:35.000 --> 07:35.800
That was fun.

07:35.800 --> 07:36.440
Wait, what?

07:36.440 --> 07:37.560
There was an orange.

07:37.560 --> 07:41.880
Your wife said open this orange and I opened it and there's tiny products inside.

07:43.240 --> 07:46.760
They said open this orange right in front of Thomas and don't offer him a chance to open

07:46.760 --> 07:51.080
any of the five slices, even though there's ten total between the two of us.

07:51.080 --> 07:53.640
And we're going to do this and we're going to laugh at his pain.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.600
Had Thomas...

07:54.600 --> 07:55.720
I just thought that was weird.

07:55.720 --> 07:58.200
Had Thomas not been staring at a puzzle and said like,

07:58.200 --> 07:59.480
Oh, can I open one?

07:59.480 --> 08:01.640
Then you would open more than one, probably.

08:02.760 --> 08:04.120
I shouldn't have to ask.

08:04.120 --> 08:04.840
That's...

08:04.840 --> 08:05.800
Oh, wow.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.880
I shouldn't have to assume what you want to do.

08:09.000 --> 08:09.960
No, you should.

08:09.960 --> 08:10.600
At all times.

08:10.600 --> 08:16.760
Why aren't you thinking about Thomas all the time?

08:16.760 --> 08:18.360
No, this is not...

08:18.360 --> 08:20.520
I was like, I could be offered an orange.

08:20.520 --> 08:22.680
I wasn't actually mad, but I thought it was fun to do.

08:24.280 --> 08:28.120
But you started thinking about it early in the orange filling process.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.400
Ten little orange slices.

08:30.040 --> 08:30.760
That is true.

08:30.760 --> 08:31.960
There's ten chances.

08:31.960 --> 08:34.040
He's starting to count on his fingers.

08:34.040 --> 08:35.240
And then looking at the ceiling.

08:36.440 --> 08:37.720
Oh, yeah.

08:37.720 --> 08:38.680
Almond breeze, huh?

08:38.680 --> 08:39.640
What if I open one?

08:39.640 --> 08:40.520
Maybe it would be cool.

08:42.200 --> 08:47.960
I guess if they stop now and offer me one, I could still even it out and get three in.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.240
I just wanted one.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.560
Thomas, you want to open one?

08:51.560 --> 08:53.320
We didn't know, unfortunately.

08:53.880 --> 08:55.800
I don't think it crossed either one of our minds.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.240
That's my whole point, clearly.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.880
But let me tell you, we did get some Oscar Mayer wieners.

09:04.760 --> 09:07.960
We got some oven roasted turkey breasts.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.000
All tiny, huh?

09:09.000 --> 09:09.640
So tiny.

09:09.640 --> 09:10.680
How small are we talking?

09:10.680 --> 09:12.120
We're talking not big.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.840
We're not even talking normal size.

09:15.800 --> 09:21.000
If you took a product and you shrunk it down like Honey, I Shrunk Your Products, it's that.

09:21.560 --> 09:22.920
Maybe it is all leading up to...

09:23.560 --> 09:25.480
It's all promotion for a movie.

09:25.480 --> 09:26.440
Everything's promotion.

09:26.440 --> 09:27.880
God, it sounds so much fun to open one of those.

09:29.800 --> 09:30.840
Actually, hold on.

09:30.840 --> 09:32.200
Joe and I are upset, too.

09:33.080 --> 09:34.200
That you didn't get oranges?

09:34.200 --> 09:34.840
Yeah.

09:34.840 --> 09:35.720
It's your wife.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.920
We weren't even aware of the phone we were missing.

09:38.920 --> 09:39.640
Bring it up.

09:39.640 --> 09:40.520
Here's how it happened.

09:40.520 --> 09:42.520
Which is worse if you think about it.

09:42.520 --> 09:43.000
I left.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.920
There's five people in this house right now, so that could have been two for everybody.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.760
Yeah, that would have been an even number.

09:48.760 --> 09:54.440
I emerged from the bathroom and I started looking through the tiny things and she said,

09:54.440 --> 09:55.720
oh, look what I have.

09:55.720 --> 09:59.560
And she went and got two packages of tiny things and said, do you want to open this with me?

09:59.560 --> 10:00.600
Stop defending that woman.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.000
I'm not.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.280
I'm putting blame on her.

10:02.280 --> 10:04.040
She was the one that went to get them.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.480
She could have came in, knocked down here.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.880
I think we're all in agreement that this is Taylor's fault.

10:07.880 --> 10:14.040
Guys, do you want to stop recording and open up two slices of oranges each?

10:14.040 --> 10:18.200
Can you imagine if we were in the middle of recording and she did come in?

10:18.200 --> 10:21.000
Could have been an all-time great episode moment.

10:23.880 --> 10:26.520
She took something from thousands of listeners, too.

10:26.520 --> 10:27.080
Damn, dude.

10:30.680 --> 10:33.240
That would have been our dragons are spooky of season two.

10:34.840 --> 10:37.080
Oh, sorry for the season one call back.

10:37.080 --> 10:40.840
Those of you who haven't made it back there, but if you are listening to this and you haven't

10:40.840 --> 10:42.920
listened to season one, what are you doing?

10:42.920 --> 10:44.760
Come on, check it out.

10:45.320 --> 10:50.520
I will say highlight of my week so far, um, opening up five slices.

10:58.520 --> 11:03.400
Oh man, let's dive into the deep sleepy slumber.

11:03.400 --> 11:06.200
Let's get into this boring shit so I can go buy some more.

11:09.880 --> 11:14.760
It is the morning of Thursday, July 7th.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.040
Right now, can you put in the music?

11:18.040 --> 11:23.320
That's like like the morning music, the morning music.

11:24.360 --> 11:29.480
It's like birds are chirping on the show and they play that same song for every show ever.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.400
Do you know what I'm talking about?

11:31.400 --> 11:31.800
I do.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.480
Is it like the Vivaldi?

11:33.480 --> 11:34.920
Is it trying to remember what it was?

11:34.920 --> 11:39.000
Cause I used to know it's, I think it's called like dawn, something morning, morning,

11:39.000 --> 11:40.120
dawn or something like that.

11:40.120 --> 11:42.760
It's a classical piece that ended up being used.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.360
Oh, it's a classical piece.

11:44.360 --> 11:45.720
Is it bittersweet symphony?

11:46.520 --> 11:47.400
Yeah, that's it.

11:47.400 --> 11:47.880
That's it.

11:57.000 --> 11:57.480
No shit.

11:57.480 --> 11:58.840
I think it's called morning wood.

11:59.480 --> 12:03.000
No, that's what it.

12:08.040 --> 12:09.640
That's what it feels like to have morning wood.

12:12.520 --> 12:14.040
I know it's morning.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.280
And a bird comes in and perches on it.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.680
Horror podcast, horror podcast, horror podcast.

12:22.680 --> 12:24.680
What if a woodpecker pecked your pecker?

12:24.680 --> 12:29.640
But no one wakes up to a woodpecker pecking at their pecker.

12:30.360 --> 12:32.600
Julius wakes up in his mind.

12:32.600 --> 12:35.400
Morningwood is playing and then he's like, uh oh.

12:38.840 --> 12:41.000
And Beck Wilder wakes up.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.200
I think probably still covered in equipment.

12:44.920 --> 12:47.160
Yeah, definitely.

12:47.720 --> 12:52.280
His headphones have kind of slacked off on his head, kind of around his face and eyes.

12:53.240 --> 12:56.520
And he's got his cameras resting on his chest.

12:57.160 --> 13:01.080
And he looks disheveled like he'd had a fiffle night's sleep.

13:01.080 --> 13:04.280
And Cal Colorado wakes up in his own bedroom.

13:04.280 --> 13:09.000
No, he wakes up on the couch in his den and he's not spilled the glass of scotch,

13:09.560 --> 13:14.600
but it is set like far closer to the edge of the table than he would normally countenance.

13:14.600 --> 13:21.880
And he kind of snorts and the Bible is still open in his hand and he's

13:21.960 --> 13:24.040
underlined, thou shalt not kill.

13:25.240 --> 13:28.840
And he's thinking about that.

13:28.840 --> 13:31.480
As he walks downstairs, probably a couple of hours before

13:32.040 --> 13:37.560
either of your wake up scenes happens to start cooking everybody waffles and eggs.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.960
Probably with a vegan option for Stevie.

13:39.960 --> 13:41.320
Oh, that's very kind.

13:41.320 --> 13:45.720
And this is how you know that we've got real role playing going on,

13:45.720 --> 13:50.360
because I know that Thomas makes damn good pancakes.

13:50.440 --> 13:51.480
So for you to go with waffles...

13:51.480 --> 13:52.520
I'm a pancake man.

13:52.520 --> 13:53.400
I'm a pancake man.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.760
Cal is a waffle man.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.720
And I stick to the character, folks.

13:57.720 --> 13:58.840
Character choice.

13:58.840 --> 13:59.340
That's right.

14:02.040 --> 14:06.440
After I dropped off that weirdo, I went to fucking Waffle House and got the All-Star Special.

14:06.440 --> 14:06.840
Oh, wow.

14:06.840 --> 14:07.640
It was good.

14:07.640 --> 14:08.520
Yeah, hell yeah.

14:08.520 --> 14:10.280
The weirdo paid me to get waffles.

14:10.280 --> 14:10.600
Nice.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.000
Nice.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.360
Some things even out.

14:12.360 --> 14:15.400
Imagine if they served pancakes there though, you know?

14:15.400 --> 14:16.760
They get so mad if you ask.

14:18.680 --> 14:20.120
This is a waffle house!

14:21.240 --> 14:23.080
Where are your manners?

14:25.640 --> 14:27.000
That's the Grumpet Palace.

14:33.480 --> 14:33.960
So yeah.

14:34.600 --> 14:39.640
Beck follows his nose like a cartoon character floating out of the couch and into the kitchen.

14:39.640 --> 14:40.760
Whoa, Cal.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.440
You doing your famous waffles?

14:42.440 --> 14:43.720
I mean, I almost said pancakes.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.160
You're not a pancake guy.

14:45.160 --> 14:47.960
Oh, I mean, I can make a mean cake when I have to, but...

14:48.840 --> 14:51.320
No, Emeril taught me how to make these waffles.

14:51.320 --> 14:51.880
Oh, bam!

14:58.680 --> 15:04.600
Beck kind of takes a plate and sidles up next to the waffle maker, just like ready to be

15:04.600 --> 15:05.800
served a hot one.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.400
Hey, did you sleep okay?

15:07.400 --> 15:08.600
I slept pretty fine.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.360
You know, a good three and a half hours.

15:10.360 --> 15:11.000
Pretty typical.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.040
Pretty typical.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.400
Three and a half, dude.

15:13.400 --> 15:14.840
I don't know how you do it.

15:14.840 --> 15:16.280
I think most people are like this.

15:16.920 --> 15:17.800
Not me, man.

15:18.520 --> 15:23.080
You know, I tend to find, you know, sure, people at work may grumble every now and then,

15:23.080 --> 15:27.000
but you know, all of us kind of love when we just really get together and push through

15:27.000 --> 15:28.280
working through the night and everything.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.040
Don't you feel that way?

15:30.040 --> 15:30.600
I mean, there is...

15:30.600 --> 15:32.120
Don't you feel energized by that?

15:32.120 --> 15:36.440
There's some camaraderie that I like there for sure, but no, I don't like it.

15:37.320 --> 15:44.440
As this just then Julius comes like lunging into the room, like doing lunging.

15:46.280 --> 15:53.000
Bec, Cal looks confused and a little hurt and he goes, Julius, would you like the first

15:53.000 --> 15:53.400
waffle?

15:58.120 --> 15:59.080
Oh, hell yeah.

16:00.120 --> 16:01.480
Oh, I mean, I was okay.

16:01.480 --> 16:03.160
Oh yeah, that'll be a couple minutes, Bec.

16:06.760 --> 16:08.520
Julius gobbled it down.

16:08.520 --> 16:09.240
He's hungry.

16:09.240 --> 16:12.280
Does Cal Keurig or make a pot of coffee?

16:12.280 --> 16:18.440
He's got an old shitty coffee maker from the nineties that he used like in his office that

16:18.440 --> 16:21.800
he still like, it's his old reliable and there's a pot of that for sure.

16:22.440 --> 16:27.640
And there's probably like three other very expensive devices for making any kind of

16:28.520 --> 16:31.480
little espresso or Chemex pour over.

16:31.480 --> 16:31.980
Yeah.

16:33.640 --> 16:35.400
Aeropress tubes and shit.

16:36.920 --> 16:38.440
He's got a Slayer in his kitchen.

16:39.080 --> 16:40.920
Shout out to all my coffee freaks out there.

16:42.440 --> 16:44.200
Can I, can I grab an energy drink?

16:45.080 --> 16:48.360
Last time I was here, you said you kept them stocked just in case we wanted one.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.560
In case Beck wanted one.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.160
If you, yeah.

16:54.120 --> 16:59.160
Yeah, I mean, I mean, he opens it up and there's like 23 and he's like, yeah, there should

16:59.160 --> 16:59.640
be enough.

17:00.680 --> 17:04.680
I figured, you know, I was first waffle boy, so I felt like maybe I'd ask.

17:05.640 --> 17:08.360
I was first waffle boy.

17:08.440 --> 17:15.320
Beck is pouring himself a cup of coffee and he is grabbing a energy also and is cracking

17:15.320 --> 17:18.360
it and he's double fisting his wake up juice.

17:18.360 --> 17:20.520
Beck, will you give me, toss me one of those.

17:20.520 --> 17:22.280
Julius, do you, do you like to work late?

17:22.280 --> 17:23.320
Well, it depends.

17:23.320 --> 17:28.280
Uh, you know, usually throughout my life, there's no like real hours on what I do.

17:28.280 --> 17:33.560
So, uh, it's not really a question of whether I like doing it, but I do, I do it.

17:33.560 --> 17:33.800
Okay.

17:33.800 --> 17:36.920
But you've enjoyed your time at city action news, right?

17:36.920 --> 17:37.960
Grinding for?

17:38.200 --> 17:38.760
The truth?

17:39.320 --> 17:39.640
Yeah.

17:39.640 --> 17:42.120
I mean, for the week or so that I've been here, it's been great.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.720
I wouldn't want to do it all the time though.

17:43.720 --> 17:45.560
I don't think he kind of narrows his eyes.

17:45.560 --> 17:46.200
Two weeks.

17:46.200 --> 17:49.240
He narrows his eyes, but he doesn't yank the waffle from here.

17:51.640 --> 17:56.360
I mean, if we're going to can is like everything we've been doing for the last two weeks.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.520
Yeah, no, I would never want to stop it.

17:58.520 --> 17:59.240
Okay.

17:59.240 --> 17:59.560
Yeah.

17:59.560 --> 18:00.120
Yeah.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.160
It's important work.

18:01.160 --> 18:02.200
Glad you feel that way.

18:02.200 --> 18:02.920
Eat up.

18:02.920 --> 18:04.120
You'll need the energy.

18:04.120 --> 18:04.840
Yum, yum, yum.

18:05.560 --> 18:07.400
Beck, I've got a hot, fresh one right here for you.

18:07.800 --> 18:08.200
Yeah.

18:08.200 --> 18:10.120
Has anybody seen Stevie yet this morning?

18:10.120 --> 18:12.520
Door was closed when you walked down the hallway.

18:12.520 --> 18:16.360
Cow like walks straight down there and knocks too loud.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.520
Not like mean, but just oblivious.

18:19.800 --> 18:20.760
Hey, sweetie.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.120
Uh, I mean, sorry, Stevie.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.720
Breakfast is ready.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.400
Um, so just come on out.

18:28.360 --> 18:29.480
Rest of the cruise.

18:29.480 --> 18:29.960
Yeah.

18:29.960 --> 18:33.240
Hot, hot, fresh waffles, uh, vegan options.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.480
I think I remember that you were maybe that.

18:35.480 --> 18:35.880
Thank you.

18:38.200 --> 18:38.440
Yeah.

18:38.440 --> 18:42.600
You can hear them laughing, uh, as they wake up and come to.

18:42.600 --> 18:43.480
Yeah, be there.

18:43.480 --> 18:44.600
Be there in a minute.

18:44.600 --> 18:49.480
Cow like stops and sniffs and he's like, Stevie, could you, you know, vape out the window?

18:49.480 --> 18:52.680
I guess it's been a weird, all right.

18:52.680 --> 18:53.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:53.320 --> 18:53.640
Sorry.

18:53.640 --> 18:54.040
Sorry.

18:54.040 --> 18:54.840
Thank you.

18:54.840 --> 19:00.840
Uh, when you get back to the kitchen, uh, Beck's plate is like a swimming pool with

19:00.840 --> 19:02.680
some waffle in it of syrup.

19:02.680 --> 19:03.880
That's how you do it, dude.

19:04.680 --> 19:08.680
Are you guys ready for, you know, D day?

19:09.720 --> 19:10.520
Daddy day.

19:10.520 --> 19:11.240
K day.

19:11.240 --> 19:11.800
Kurt day.

19:12.840 --> 19:13.720
Stop guys.

19:13.720 --> 19:14.120
Come on.

19:18.120 --> 19:20.840
Well, I guess, are you guys ready to go down the K hole?

19:23.800 --> 19:27.080
Cal, Cal like winces, but he's like, I'll meet you halfway with that one.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.240
We're going to go down the K hole.

19:30.440 --> 19:31.480
He might even like that.

19:31.480 --> 19:33.640
Maybe he can, maybe we can get him to stop the whole daddy.

19:34.280 --> 19:35.960
Do you know that voice is not real, right?

19:37.160 --> 19:38.520
That's not his real voice.

19:38.520 --> 19:44.280
I had no reason to assume that he would have a fake voice, but he sounds twice as old as

19:44.280 --> 19:44.760
he looks.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.560
Have you heard his real voice?

19:47.560 --> 19:48.360
What's it sound like?

19:49.400 --> 19:53.400
It's just like a normal, normal kind of a little, you know, shyer.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.320
I don't know that it's not his real voice.

19:55.320 --> 19:58.040
I just assume you're right though.

19:58.040 --> 19:59.960
It does seem like it's putting it on for sure.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.880
He's definitely putting it on a little bit, right?

20:02.200 --> 20:02.680
Yeah.

20:02.680 --> 20:06.040
Stevie's behind you and they say shyer.

20:06.040 --> 20:07.720
Like he sounds like a hobbit.

20:10.040 --> 20:10.840
Have a waffle.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.000
Good morning.

20:13.000 --> 20:13.880
Good morning, Stevie.

20:13.880 --> 20:14.600
Have a waffle.

20:15.240 --> 20:16.440
Not a morning person.

20:16.440 --> 20:17.640
Yeah, me too, dude.

20:17.640 --> 20:18.120
Yeah.

20:18.120 --> 20:19.640
Energy drink helps.

20:19.640 --> 20:21.160
Oh, uh, thanks.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.520
I'll do a coffee.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.440
You know, as you get older, that'll, that'll change.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.440
I used to sleep until seven or eight sometimes.

20:27.640 --> 20:28.680
And I was your hitch.

20:29.480 --> 20:31.800
I heard you guys, you guys talking.

20:31.800 --> 20:34.360
What's the, what's the game plan?

20:34.360 --> 20:36.040
There's a lot going on today.

20:36.040 --> 20:43.480
Well, first off we got to, uh, we're meeting, uh, Kurt, Kurt at his K hole at the K hole.

20:43.480 --> 20:43.720
Okay.

20:43.720 --> 20:44.440
That's what you were.

20:44.440 --> 20:46.440
So I guess we're going to go do that.

20:46.440 --> 20:51.320
And then after that, what we could, we, we could go to the church at Godel.

20:51.320 --> 20:55.080
We could go to, we could go to the prison to talk to Kaylee silver.

20:55.080 --> 20:57.880
We could, those two sound like other good options.

20:57.880 --> 21:00.280
And then we have that meeting at the foundry.

21:00.280 --> 21:02.680
The underground jazz abode.

21:02.680 --> 21:04.680
Well, and the foundry for lunch.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.240
Right.

21:05.240 --> 21:05.640
Oh yeah.

21:05.640 --> 21:07.000
You guys were going to meet.

21:07.000 --> 21:07.720
What was his name?

21:07.720 --> 21:09.320
Rock Brock Hargrave.

21:09.320 --> 21:09.880
Right.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.000
There's a rock guy.

21:11.000 --> 21:11.320
Yeah.

21:11.320 --> 21:13.560
And everyone's looking at Cal.

21:13.560 --> 21:15.320
Didn't you know like,

21:15.320 --> 21:16.360
Oh yeah, yeah, hold on.

21:16.360 --> 21:20.920
And he like, he disappears down the hallway and he comes back a second later and he's

21:20.920 --> 21:21.720
like here.

21:21.720 --> 21:27.240
And it's a big picture of him and dr Brock, uh, in like 1999 at a new year's Eve party

21:27.240 --> 21:28.040
in the city.

21:28.040 --> 21:30.920
And he has a shirt on that says new year's Brock and Eve.

21:33.080 --> 21:33.800
Very good.

21:35.000 --> 21:35.480
Yeah.

21:35.480 --> 21:44.920
So standing next to a younger Cal Colorado, you see dr Brock Hargrave, who is a tall wiry

21:44.920 --> 21:49.800
man with a short beard and his hands are stained with dirt.

21:50.360 --> 21:56.760
Even at this party, uh, he's wearing a flannel shirt, cargo pants, rugged boots.

21:57.240 --> 22:04.600
A well worn backpack and a faded gray brown cowboy hat sits top his head.

22:05.240 --> 22:09.000
And you see that he is holding the top of a shovel.

22:09.560 --> 22:13.080
And Cal, you remember him always having that shovel with him.

22:13.080 --> 22:15.080
I remember he always had that shovel with him.

22:15.080 --> 22:15.720
Is that?

22:15.720 --> 22:20.840
And then the camera whip pans over to the shovel that's sitting in the corner of the

22:20.840 --> 22:23.560
breakfast nook in Cal Colorado's home.

22:23.560 --> 22:28.760
Cal's eyes dart from the photo in his hand to the, uh, the shovel sitting over in the

22:28.760 --> 22:31.480
nook back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.

22:31.480 --> 22:34.280
And it's like, son of a bitch, that's Brock shovel.

22:35.240 --> 22:36.440
We can give it to him at lunch.

22:38.120 --> 22:44.040
Do you think that maybe, maybe one of those pairs of legs was Brock?

22:44.040 --> 22:47.560
It does seem weird that he would leave such a prized possession behind like that.

22:47.560 --> 22:58.120
Uh, uh, uh, oh, no.

22:59.960 --> 23:01.960
Well, but yes.

23:09.320 --> 23:12.840
Joe Thomas, I need you to leave the room real quick.

23:13.000 --> 23:22.200
I just wanted to check in and make sure that you remember Julius's interaction with Dr.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.400
Brock Hargrave.

23:23.400 --> 23:24.120
Oh shit.

23:24.120 --> 23:24.360
No.

23:27.400 --> 23:31.800
So in this moment, it was him with the water features.

23:31.800 --> 23:32.520
Exactly.

23:32.520 --> 23:32.920
Fuck.

23:32.920 --> 23:33.720
Okay.

23:33.720 --> 23:36.680
Was that before the haves happened?

23:36.680 --> 23:38.600
That was yesterday before.

23:38.600 --> 23:39.000
Yeah.

23:39.000 --> 23:39.640
Wait.

23:39.640 --> 23:42.760
That happened when I was delivering a package to him.

23:42.760 --> 23:43.000
Right.

23:43.000 --> 23:43.240
Yeah.

23:43.240 --> 23:44.200
A couple of weeks ago.

23:44.200 --> 23:44.840
Okay.

23:44.840 --> 23:45.240
Yes.

23:45.240 --> 23:47.160
I hadn't, I hadn't remembered that.

23:47.160 --> 23:48.120
So cool.

23:48.120 --> 23:48.760
Nice.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.440
I will have a sudden realization.

23:52.440 --> 23:52.760
Yeah.

23:52.760 --> 23:54.520
Cause the picture sparked your memory.

23:54.520 --> 23:55.480
Absolutely.

23:55.480 --> 23:57.240
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

23:57.240 --> 23:58.040
Squaaaaa.

24:00.920 --> 24:03.080
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

24:04.520 --> 24:05.160
No movement.

24:05.720 --> 24:07.880
Maybe they're listening to bird noises on their phone.

24:09.640 --> 24:13.800
I could not hear your birdies.

24:14.440 --> 24:17.400
They were just listening in through the door and they're like, okay, we got to give it

24:17.400 --> 24:23.800
a minute to act like we too long.

24:23.800 --> 24:31.480
And we're zoomed in on Cal Colorado's face as he processes one of many scenarios.

24:31.480 --> 24:32.280
Hold on, Cal.

24:32.280 --> 24:34.680
Can I, can I get a better look at that picture?

24:35.320 --> 24:36.040
Yeah.

24:36.040 --> 24:41.880
I I've met him before I met him like a couple of weeks ago.

24:43.800 --> 24:44.440
Okay.

24:44.440 --> 24:52.440
At his house, I, I delivered a package to him and he gave me a bag.

24:52.440 --> 24:55.560
Was this for your, your X files?

24:55.560 --> 24:55.880
Yeah.

24:55.880 --> 25:01.320
I, well, the last time I was at the zeitgeist, I met with X and, and she gave me a package

25:01.320 --> 25:06.040
to deliver to him and I, you know, I didn't ask any questions.

25:06.040 --> 25:10.440
I just gave it to him and he gave me a bag and I, I looked at what was in the bag and

25:10.440 --> 25:18.120
it was like a rubbing of, of like, I don't know, some like old language or like weird

25:18.120 --> 25:18.440
symbols.

25:18.440 --> 25:22.920
I couldn't really tell what it was and I didn't, you know, I didn't really mess with

25:22.920 --> 25:23.320
it.

25:23.320 --> 25:25.480
I just took that back to my house.

25:26.120 --> 25:29.160
Was there like any information with it or was it like just that?

25:29.160 --> 25:30.280
I didn't really look through.

25:30.280 --> 25:33.160
I didn't want to like make it seem like I had looked through it.

25:33.160 --> 25:38.280
I didn't open up the package that, that I gave him either, but maybe X knows something

25:38.280 --> 25:39.000
about it.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.600
I'm worried that Dr.

25:40.600 --> 25:43.400
Brock's not going to make his lunch date with us.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.000
That's kind of what I'm thinking too.

25:45.720 --> 25:47.000
Seeming more and more likely.

25:47.640 --> 25:48.760
Well, clean your plates.

25:48.760 --> 25:50.280
There's starving children in contention.

25:55.080 --> 25:55.720
Thanks, Mr.

25:55.720 --> 25:56.440
Colorado.

25:56.440 --> 25:57.320
You're welcome, Stevie.

25:57.320 --> 26:01.000
Yeah, thanks.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.280
Yeah, they look at everyone else.

26:04.120 --> 26:08.200
Cal, these are the best you've ever done and that is saying something.

26:08.200 --> 26:08.760
Thank you, Beck.

26:09.800 --> 26:13.320
Working with you every day is like the best work I've ever done.

26:14.840 --> 26:15.880
Thanks, man.

26:15.880 --> 26:16.520
You too.

26:16.520 --> 26:17.960
Let's go shoot some holes.

26:17.960 --> 26:20.200
Let's go shoot that fucking kale.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.200
Hands in.

26:22.200 --> 26:23.400
Mighty ducks on three.

26:23.480 --> 26:27.000
One, two, three.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.840
Maybe next time.

26:40.840 --> 26:46.280
City action news on N C A N.

26:46.280 --> 26:47.800
City action news.

26:48.440 --> 26:48.680
Cool.

26:49.400 --> 26:49.960
Hell yeah.

26:49.960 --> 26:51.560
I always wanted to do that.

26:51.560 --> 26:52.760
Now you have shotgun.

26:53.960 --> 27:05.720
We're here.

27:06.360 --> 27:08.440
That was, yes, that was beautiful.

27:08.440 --> 27:15.320
We saw the map from overhead with the fun sound effects and a little animated van.

27:16.840 --> 27:19.880
Yeah, the Mercedes van.

27:19.880 --> 27:20.360
Yeah.

27:20.360 --> 27:21.160
Fuck yeah.

27:21.160 --> 27:23.240
It does a little loop de loop on accident.

27:24.840 --> 27:32.120
And we get to the bridge, which, um, has now been completely shut off from traffic.

27:32.120 --> 27:35.720
There's a big pylons in the road.

27:35.720 --> 27:39.160
The big, like heavy orange guys.

27:39.160 --> 27:41.320
They do not need to construct more pylons here.

27:44.680 --> 27:45.480
I don't get that.

27:46.600 --> 27:47.320
I don't get that.

27:52.120 --> 27:54.280
I felt that in my soul.

27:55.320 --> 27:56.280
Julius Chuckles.

27:57.080 --> 27:57.800
It's nothing.

27:57.800 --> 27:58.920
No, it was a good one, Julius.

27:58.920 --> 27:59.640
It was really good.

27:59.640 --> 28:00.600
That was super funny.

28:01.560 --> 28:01.880
What?

28:01.880 --> 28:02.920
What's so funny?

28:02.920 --> 28:03.320
Stevie.

28:03.320 --> 28:04.200
What's funny?

28:04.200 --> 28:05.400
He's just really fun.

28:05.400 --> 28:06.200
Tell him, Stevie.

28:06.200 --> 28:06.600
Tell him.

28:06.600 --> 28:06.840
Yeah.

28:06.840 --> 28:07.560
Describe it.

28:07.560 --> 28:08.600
What does, what does that mean?

28:09.480 --> 28:13.000
I mean, have you played Minecraft?

28:13.720 --> 28:14.040
Yes.

28:15.000 --> 28:15.480
Close.

28:16.680 --> 28:17.320
Yeah, it is.

28:18.280 --> 28:22.680
You got, you got subtract 20 years from that.

28:23.240 --> 28:25.160
Well, subtract one word and add another.

28:26.920 --> 28:28.520
Instead of down up.

28:28.520 --> 28:29.880
Oh man.

28:29.880 --> 28:31.080
I'm so confused.

28:33.480 --> 28:38.040
Not down in a mine, but up amongst the clouds.

28:40.280 --> 28:41.880
Cloudcraft would be dope.

28:41.880 --> 28:42.520
That's cool.

28:42.520 --> 28:44.200
Sounds like a cool game.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.400
I've been playing tears of the kingdom.

28:45.400 --> 28:47.000
It's that's okay.

28:48.280 --> 28:49.280
Gotcha.

28:49.280 --> 28:50.760
Up more up.

28:50.760 --> 28:51.640
What?

28:51.640 --> 28:52.840
Upper than the sky.

28:52.840 --> 28:53.880
Above the sky.

28:53.880 --> 28:56.040
Space craft.

28:56.040 --> 28:57.560
Star craft.

28:57.560 --> 28:58.440
There you go.

28:58.440 --> 28:59.080
Oh yeah.

28:59.080 --> 28:59.400
Okay.

28:59.400 --> 29:04.920
So there's this game that a bunch of people played for like hours on end.

29:06.440 --> 29:07.400
There's pot.

29:07.400 --> 29:08.680
Julius gets out of the car.

29:11.320 --> 29:12.920
Stevie, I think I see Kurt.

29:12.920 --> 29:14.520
So why don't you tell me about it later?

29:18.120 --> 29:21.560
I roll to know about star.

29:25.080 --> 29:26.200
Oh God.

29:26.200 --> 29:33.560
And Kurt is waiting for you all in an alleyway and he's on the bridge.

29:33.560 --> 29:33.960
Oh no.

29:33.960 --> 29:36.760
An alleyway, like near the bridge and he's locked up.

29:36.760 --> 29:38.200
He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:38.200 --> 29:39.800
There's a bunch of blocks.

29:39.800 --> 29:43.240
So you can only get like a block away from the bridge at this point.

29:43.240 --> 29:46.200
And so you can see it from here, but there's no one.

29:47.160 --> 29:47.800
Watching it.

29:47.800 --> 29:50.600
We've got the credentials, even if they were so.

29:50.600 --> 29:51.080
Yeah.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.600
We're the news we're allowed to be anywhere.

29:54.520 --> 29:58.440
Beck is putting on his lanyard that has his press pass in it.

29:58.440 --> 30:02.840
As you lift the lanyard above your head, looking through the hole,

30:02.840 --> 30:09.800
you see Kurt kind of waving you over like hurriedly and worriedly.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.240
Hey guys, there's Kurt over there.

30:11.240 --> 30:12.040
We go talk to him.

30:12.040 --> 30:12.920
He's in his thirties.

30:12.920 --> 30:13.800
He looks older.

30:13.800 --> 30:19.800
His eyes are sunken in and he's wearing a disheveled can windbreaker.

30:19.800 --> 30:24.840
He's got big curly hair atop his kind of tiny head.

30:25.560 --> 30:31.720
Oh, he's got a old TC and polo on underneath the can windbreaker.

30:31.720 --> 30:36.200
And as you notice that Cal, he kind of zips up the windbreaker and is like,

30:37.640 --> 30:40.280
Hey, are you wearing, I've got the drone.

30:41.080 --> 30:42.760
Are you wearing your can colors?

30:43.400 --> 30:45.640
In addition to the city news colors.

30:45.640 --> 30:47.800
No, no, it's not like that.

30:47.800 --> 30:50.760
You cannot solely the can colors like that.

30:50.760 --> 30:51.800
No, no.

30:51.800 --> 30:53.400
At least you zipped up.

30:53.400 --> 30:54.680
I didn't do it.

30:54.680 --> 30:55.960
I just saw you.

30:55.960 --> 30:58.760
And he just stares at you with these sunken in eyes.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.160
Beck, were you filming that?

31:01.160 --> 31:01.720
I got it.

31:01.720 --> 31:02.040
Okay.

31:02.040 --> 31:02.540
Yeah.

31:03.320 --> 31:03.820
Fuck.

31:04.520 --> 31:05.000
Drone.

31:05.000 --> 31:05.720
Let's drone.

31:05.720 --> 31:06.200
Let's do it.

31:06.200 --> 31:06.680
Come on.

31:06.680 --> 31:07.560
Okay.

31:07.560 --> 31:10.280
He reaches down into a bowling bag.

31:10.280 --> 31:10.760
Nice.

31:10.760 --> 31:11.160
Cool.

31:11.480 --> 31:13.160
Pulls out a drone.

31:14.360 --> 31:17.000
It's like, let's do this.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.120
Let's go.

31:18.120 --> 31:21.720
How did I, it was, it was older.

31:21.720 --> 31:25.480
It was like more like this and just a little sexual undertone.

31:26.760 --> 31:27.960
Do you need to listen to it again?

31:27.960 --> 31:31.800
No, please do.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.160
I'm excited about this.

31:35.160 --> 31:38.360
The last time we had a drone experience, it went well.

31:38.840 --> 31:45.080
And the last time, the last time Zach listened to this guy's voice, it, uh, it got used.

31:45.080 --> 31:47.720
So maybe this time a drone will hit him in the fucking throat.

31:48.440 --> 31:52.120
I was doing the city news voice.

31:54.440 --> 31:56.440
So you it's, so it's a, it's a voice.

31:56.440 --> 31:57.320
You admit it's a voice.

31:57.320 --> 31:58.360
I didn't do it.

31:58.360 --> 32:00.920
Cal, Cal, you called it.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.200
That's putting the cows.

32:02.200 --> 32:02.520
Nope.

32:02.520 --> 32:03.080
You got it.

32:03.080 --> 32:03.640
I told you.

32:03.640 --> 32:06.200
You didn't skip out from a mile away.

32:06.200 --> 32:07.960
None of you know what's true.

32:08.040 --> 32:09.880
Just talk, just talk normal.

32:09.880 --> 32:10.680
All right.

32:10.680 --> 32:11.000
All right.

32:11.000 --> 32:11.320
All right.

32:11.320 --> 32:11.720
All right.

32:11.720 --> 32:17.880
And he is going to drone it up and succeeds.

32:18.440 --> 32:27.160
And he flies the drone up and up and up along the buildings on either side of you in this

32:27.160 --> 32:33.240
alleyway, old brick architecture with arches over the windows.

32:33.960 --> 32:36.520
And then the drone flies out.

32:37.400 --> 32:44.440
In the distance, you see the bridge, you see the city river flowing through wide and vast

32:44.440 --> 32:52.920
and dark and strong, and you see the drone follow the path of the road over to the bridge.

32:53.800 --> 32:58.440
And then it hovers above the gaping hole.

32:59.880 --> 33:00.840
It's smooth.

33:01.160 --> 33:07.640
You've seen it before, but through this lens from the top down, getting the full circumference

33:07.640 --> 33:17.560
as the drone continues down, a light turns on the sun still kind of in the corner of

33:17.560 --> 33:18.200
the sky.

33:18.200 --> 33:25.400
Hasn't quite lit this far down inside the hole, but the light from the drone shines

33:25.800 --> 33:32.440
shines bright below and illuminates crashing waves.

33:34.840 --> 33:36.520
Uh, okay.

33:36.520 --> 33:38.040
Kurt, can it, can it swim?

33:39.880 --> 33:40.120
Yeah.

33:41.080 --> 33:42.200
Go, go down there.

33:42.200 --> 33:42.840
Oh, that's cool.

33:43.560 --> 33:44.760
Descend on my dude.

33:44.760 --> 33:45.400
Yeah.

33:45.400 --> 33:46.360
Submerge.

33:46.360 --> 33:47.480
Don't hit the tugboat.

33:47.480 --> 33:47.960
Stop it.

33:47.960 --> 33:48.920
I was doing it.

33:50.040 --> 33:50.360
Okay.

33:50.360 --> 33:50.760
Okay.

33:50.760 --> 33:51.320
Okay.

33:51.320 --> 33:51.560
Okay.

33:55.880 --> 33:58.840
That goes to grab the controls and I get slapped back.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.360
Julius kind of looks at Kalin back.

34:02.360 --> 34:04.440
He's like, let daddy do his work.

34:05.000 --> 34:05.800
Thank you.

34:06.520 --> 34:09.640
Oh, I can relax my shoulders.

34:11.960 --> 34:20.280
And it plunges and the drone is wet and the light kind of flashes, flickers, brushing

34:20.280 --> 34:26.440
bubbles, and then you get deeper and the current kind of fades off.

34:27.480 --> 34:37.000
And at the bottom of the city river, you see a tugboat that is like moving back and forth

34:37.000 --> 34:43.320
just a little bit, almost like something on the other side is like doing exactly what

34:43.320 --> 34:47.720
Thomas is doing with his hand, which is like wiggling it back and forth.

34:48.280 --> 34:49.880
And it's just rocking.

34:51.000 --> 34:58.120
You can only see half of it as the drone descends down one side and makes its way.

34:58.120 --> 35:03.160
You see a very sharp circle along the ground.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.360
It's tugboats stuck in a hole.

35:07.240 --> 35:13.400
Can you like navigate the drone into the tugboat and then down past the hole and then out

35:13.400 --> 35:15.480
a window of the tugboat beneath the hole?

35:15.480 --> 35:15.640
Yeah.

35:15.640 --> 35:17.160
Can you get further into the hole?

35:17.160 --> 35:20.680
That is the coolest thing that you've ever said.

35:20.680 --> 35:21.400
Wow.

35:21.400 --> 35:25.640
My man, first you call me daddy, then you have a cool thought like that.

35:25.640 --> 35:29.960
I mean, you boys could learn a thing or two from this young gentleman.

35:29.960 --> 35:33.080
Julius is like fake smiling and nodding his head.

35:33.960 --> 35:36.520
Yes, we all have a lot to learn from young Julius.

35:36.520 --> 35:39.320
He's a shining bright star at Cannes.

35:40.600 --> 35:46.600
His career and, you know, workplace behavior is something we might all strive to emulate,

35:46.600 --> 35:46.840
Kurt.

35:49.880 --> 35:55.080
Julius's smile gets more fake.

35:58.920 --> 35:59.480
I'm sorry.

35:59.480 --> 36:05.400
I didn't mean to, you know, I'm not talking about, you know, uh, the stuff, but you know

36:05.400 --> 36:05.880
what, nevermind.

36:05.880 --> 36:08.040
Just can you just send that drone down that fucking hole?

36:08.040 --> 36:12.040
In Julius's mind, he thinks Cal is talking about the fact that he's not going to be the

36:12.040 --> 36:13.480
like lead producer.

36:13.480 --> 36:14.600
That's like what's.

36:14.600 --> 36:19.400
Yeah, because you've, you've wrapped your uncle in a wall of thighs.

36:19.960 --> 36:20.200
Yes.

36:24.200 --> 36:24.520
Wow.

36:26.920 --> 36:34.920
A beautiful, beautiful sentiment as the camera heads into the tugboat, as Zach watches a

36:34.920 --> 36:38.840
tugboat tour on YouTube.

36:38.840 --> 36:39.960
I can just come out the butt.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.240
I think we all assumed it would come out the butthole.

36:43.240 --> 36:43.740
Yeah.

36:44.440 --> 36:47.000
This guy's really showing me a lot of knobs.

36:47.800 --> 36:48.920
Not interested.

36:48.920 --> 36:49.960
Yeah, it's all in the front.

36:49.960 --> 36:51.080
It's knobs on the front.

36:52.200 --> 36:53.800
Got the bottle on the back.

36:53.800 --> 36:54.920
Aft as they say.

36:55.720 --> 36:58.600
And the drone, you learn a lot from those videos.

37:00.440 --> 37:01.720
Through the sea of knobs.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.920
Delicately avoiding each.

37:04.920 --> 37:05.800
There's so many.

37:06.040 --> 37:07.000
Step here, boy.

37:09.800 --> 37:13.400
That's what Kurt is saying to the camera that he's directing.

37:15.400 --> 37:21.000
And looks up and is like, oh, I mean, I mean, oh yeah, the knobs get on through there.

37:21.000 --> 37:25.400
My guy, I was like, no, I kind of thought the pirate thing was a little cool, better

37:25.400 --> 37:29.240
than your usual stick, you know, sex monster or whatever.

37:32.120 --> 37:33.000
Let him focus.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.520
The drone continues.

37:40.520 --> 37:46.920
Oh, the drone continues on down into the tugboat and then through the back.

37:46.920 --> 37:47.640
Oh my God.

37:47.640 --> 37:48.760
So many knobs.

37:48.760 --> 37:50.360
And out the other side.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.360
We're through the butt, gentlemen.

37:54.760 --> 37:57.880
The screen that you're watching flickers.

37:57.880 --> 38:05.000
And as it flickers, it's like the scene changes completely.

38:07.880 --> 38:09.080
Who changed the channel?

38:11.080 --> 38:13.160
This is a pretty important role.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.120
What are we rolling?

38:17.160 --> 38:18.600
One of you should do it.

38:19.320 --> 38:23.480
No, you're going to roll a specific die for me.

38:23.480 --> 38:25.080
And I'm going to tell you which one.

38:25.080 --> 38:28.120
One momentarily.

38:28.120 --> 38:28.920
Okay.

38:28.920 --> 38:33.400
After I find a tugboat butthole chart.

38:33.400 --> 38:33.720
Yeah.

38:33.720 --> 38:35.240
I can't find the butthole.

38:35.240 --> 38:37.720
It's the it's right under the poop deck.

38:43.160 --> 38:44.280
I think I got it.

38:45.000 --> 38:45.720
Six.

38:45.720 --> 38:47.640
You can go ahead and roll a D six for me.

38:47.640 --> 38:48.920
Everybody or one person.

38:48.920 --> 38:49.880
Just one person.

38:49.880 --> 38:51.240
Roll them skull boys, Joe.

38:51.240 --> 38:51.740
Yeah.

38:52.360 --> 38:53.480
I hope it's good.

38:53.480 --> 38:54.360
I hope it's a six.

38:55.080 --> 38:58.280
It's a three, which is either the middle right in the middle.

38:58.280 --> 38:59.800
Oh my God.

38:59.800 --> 39:01.000
Very cool.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.840
You see three more tugboats.

39:04.600 --> 39:13.960
The camera is no longer submerged in water and it is no longer being lit by the light

39:13.960 --> 39:21.400
that is shining from off the drone because there is sunlight coming in from the windows

39:21.400 --> 39:25.320
at the top of a gymnasium.

39:27.320 --> 39:30.200
An old timey school gymnasium.

39:31.640 --> 39:39.800
You see dust falling in the sun rays that make their way down onto the basketball court.

39:41.960 --> 39:48.040
And on the far side, underneath one of the basketball hoops.

39:48.040 --> 39:56.440
There's a throne and it's bloody.

39:58.840 --> 40:05.400
Double doors open on the right side of this room, opposite from where the sun is coming

40:05.400 --> 40:16.440
in and the light hits a young creature, small creature, humanoid, not quite human.

40:16.440 --> 40:20.040
Ears are too high on its head, too round.

40:20.040 --> 40:27.960
And it's wearing a school uniform suddenly is sprinting on all fours directly toward

40:27.960 --> 40:28.520
the drone.

40:29.160 --> 40:36.200
As it gets closer, you see blood on its face and hands and on the uniform itself.

40:37.320 --> 40:39.480
And I am in a call for a roll.

40:40.520 --> 40:44.360
One of you guys should roll for the drone operation here.

40:44.360 --> 40:44.860
Okay.

40:45.660 --> 40:48.540
Thomas, go ahead and roll for the drone operation.

40:48.540 --> 40:50.940
Kurt is pretty good.

40:50.940 --> 40:52.060
65.

40:52.060 --> 40:52.780
Fuck yeah.

40:52.780 --> 40:53.500
65.

40:55.340 --> 40:56.300
43.

40:56.300 --> 40:57.820
He nimbly fucking.

40:57.820 --> 40:59.660
Oh, maybe it's 21.

40:59.660 --> 41:00.620
Oh, hell yeah.

41:00.620 --> 41:01.180
Yes.

41:01.180 --> 41:02.220
Nimbly.

41:02.220 --> 41:06.220
This thing is coming directly toward you.

41:07.260 --> 41:08.940
Oh, yes.

41:08.940 --> 41:10.700
I've got it.

41:10.700 --> 41:18.140
And it goes straight up in the air and this thing launches itself off its hind legs to

41:18.140 --> 41:22.460
try to grab onto the drone and just barely taps it.

41:22.460 --> 41:24.940
And you get the little wiggle on the camera.

41:25.980 --> 41:31.340
The camera is looking down at this thing as it sort of begins to circle and prowl and

41:31.340 --> 41:32.460
looking up.

41:32.460 --> 41:35.740
Just a quick aside, Zach, you know, you control this whole world.

41:35.740 --> 41:40.460
Why wasn't the throne and the weird boy covered in, say, chocolate instead of blood?

41:40.700 --> 41:41.200
True.

41:42.460 --> 41:43.580
You have these choices.

41:43.580 --> 41:44.300
That reminds me.

41:44.300 --> 41:44.780
Roll grip.

41:47.580 --> 41:49.980
Oh, not a good one for Cal Colorado.

41:49.980 --> 41:53.900
It's a fail for me, Julius.

41:53.900 --> 41:55.180
Beck fails also.

41:55.180 --> 41:56.540
All righty.

41:57.180 --> 42:00.140
Well, I think this is going to be a decently fat one, even though...

42:00.140 --> 42:03.020
And fat grip chair.

42:03.020 --> 42:12.460
So I think let's go with a D4 and another D4.

42:12.460 --> 42:13.260
Oh, my.

42:15.260 --> 42:18.140
A two and a four.

42:18.700 --> 42:21.660
That's a three and a four.

42:23.340 --> 42:25.740
A three and a four.

42:27.340 --> 42:30.380
I lost seven and that puts me at my breaking point.

42:30.380 --> 42:33.660
I also lost seven and that is a breaking point for Cal.

42:33.660 --> 42:37.420
I lost six and it puts me one above my breaking point.

42:37.420 --> 42:38.620
I'm close, but haven't broken.

42:41.420 --> 42:42.300
Oh, my God.

42:42.300 --> 42:43.820
You have 12 grip?

42:43.820 --> 42:44.320
Yes.

42:48.300 --> 42:49.980
Yeah, that actually makes a ton of sense.

42:51.820 --> 42:55.020
And funny enough, my next breaking point is at zero.

42:55.020 --> 42:55.520
I don't have...

42:57.100 --> 42:57.740
Last one.

42:58.540 --> 42:59.260
Last one.

42:59.260 --> 42:59.580
All right.

42:59.660 --> 43:07.900
Well, so let's get Joe and Luke to leave the room and we'll start with Thomas here.

43:08.940 --> 43:10.220
Well, well, well.

43:10.220 --> 43:11.660
Hey, Zach, that was really cool.

43:11.660 --> 43:13.340
I like coming down into a gym.

43:13.340 --> 43:15.580
That was not expected and very fucking cool.

43:15.580 --> 43:16.080
Hey, thanks.

43:16.700 --> 43:17.820
And I'm scared of the gym.

43:18.220 --> 43:31.980
Hey, dude, what do you want to lose your shit about?

43:32.860 --> 43:33.360
I don't know.

43:33.900 --> 43:36.300
When I fail my grip, does that mean I know it's real?

43:36.300 --> 43:38.380
Yeah, I think you do.

43:38.380 --> 43:39.740
I think you know it's real.

43:39.740 --> 43:40.240
Okay.

43:40.620 --> 43:42.620
What's Cal's grip at currently?

43:42.620 --> 43:43.260
35.

43:43.820 --> 43:44.700
Gotten pretty low.

43:44.700 --> 43:45.260
Yeah, that's...

43:45.260 --> 43:48.380
His last fear was about big bodies of water.

43:49.260 --> 43:52.620
So I think we can maybe even just like add on to that.

43:52.620 --> 43:58.060
Where now it's like a fear of going down that hole or being sucked down.

43:58.940 --> 44:00.940
A fear of being sucked down holes.

44:01.580 --> 44:02.300
Yeah.

44:02.300 --> 44:07.100
Yeah, and like absolutely not getting in water because you'll get sucked down a hole.

44:07.100 --> 44:07.580
I don't know.

44:07.580 --> 44:11.580
That seems simple, which isn't bad necessarily.

44:12.460 --> 44:14.460
There are lots of holes in all sorts of stuff.

44:15.900 --> 44:17.100
Yeah, I think it's the holes.

44:17.100 --> 44:18.380
I think that's...

44:18.380 --> 44:21.020
Anything that's a perfectly round hole, you're just like...

44:21.020 --> 44:22.300
It's got to be pretty massive.

44:22.300 --> 44:25.820
I don't think you're gonna be able to throw any old hole at him,

44:25.820 --> 44:29.500
but unnaturally large and unnaturally smooth holes.

44:29.500 --> 44:31.740
I mean, those are already terrifying, right?

44:32.300 --> 44:32.940
Maybe for you.

44:34.620 --> 44:35.900
I don't know what that means.

44:38.700 --> 44:40.220
For me, that's a walk in the park.

44:40.220 --> 44:41.180
Big holes.

44:41.180 --> 44:42.060
Big holes?

44:42.060 --> 44:43.340
Come on, that's Tuesday.

44:46.140 --> 44:51.500
He could be afraid of the power of new media.

44:53.500 --> 44:54.060
Drones.

44:55.020 --> 44:55.980
Anti-drone.

44:55.980 --> 44:56.860
Anti-drone.

44:56.860 --> 44:59.820
It could be anti-Jim, anti-cat boy.

45:00.620 --> 45:01.340
Certainly.

45:01.340 --> 45:03.820
Again, probably just normal.

45:05.340 --> 45:09.820
Yeah, I think going anti-new tech would be good.

45:09.820 --> 45:10.320
Yeah.

45:10.700 --> 45:12.620
He already doesn't understand a lot of technology.

45:13.580 --> 45:15.500
Now he fears and hates it.

45:15.500 --> 45:18.300
Oh, that sucks.

45:18.300 --> 45:20.700
Now we're getting to the sad part of Cal-Colorado.

45:20.700 --> 45:21.260
That's...

45:21.260 --> 45:23.340
Yes, that's what I don't want to...

45:23.340 --> 45:24.860
Well, that's the end.

45:24.860 --> 45:26.620
I mean, this is where we're going.

45:26.620 --> 45:27.900
He'll find a way out.

45:28.620 --> 45:29.580
Man, he won't...

45:29.580 --> 45:31.100
Maybe through his daughter.

45:31.100 --> 45:31.820
Maybe.

45:31.820 --> 45:32.860
That'd be cool.

45:32.860 --> 45:34.780
The strength of love, Zach.

45:34.780 --> 45:35.100
Man...

45:35.900 --> 45:40.540
Do you have the courage to DM a Delta Green game where love conquers all?

45:42.700 --> 45:44.220
Or are you a pussy?

45:44.220 --> 45:46.060
Or are you a fucking little bitch?

45:50.460 --> 45:51.500
All right, so yeah.

45:51.500 --> 45:52.540
That sounds good.

45:52.540 --> 45:55.260
He's gonna really want to do things the old way.

45:55.260 --> 45:55.740
Okay.

45:55.740 --> 45:56.380
He's gonna...

45:56.380 --> 45:57.580
That's perfect for this.

45:57.580 --> 45:59.340
I mean, where we're going, that's...

45:59.340 --> 45:59.840
Boom.

46:00.620 --> 46:01.980
Send in a boy.

46:01.980 --> 46:04.140
Preferably, I think, Luke.

46:04.140 --> 46:05.420
Because Joe doesn't have...

46:05.420 --> 46:05.900
Oh, wait.

46:05.900 --> 46:06.860
No, sit down.

46:06.860 --> 46:07.260
Sit down.

46:07.260 --> 46:07.820
Sit back down.

46:08.860 --> 46:11.740
Fight, flight, or freeze.

46:13.500 --> 46:16.700
Fight, freeze, flight.

46:17.260 --> 46:17.740
Okay.

46:17.740 --> 46:18.780
And that's a D6?

46:18.780 --> 46:19.260
Yes, sir.

46:20.780 --> 46:21.980
Five, so fight.

46:21.980 --> 46:23.420
He punches Kurt in the face.

46:27.340 --> 46:27.820
Thank you.

46:30.460 --> 46:32.940
Get that drone fucking bullshit out of here.

46:34.460 --> 46:36.140
We don't need to see this shit, Kurt.

46:42.700 --> 46:43.580
I'm in trouble.

46:47.260 --> 46:49.260
I hope you've been thinking about what you've done.

46:50.220 --> 46:51.100
I'm in danger.

46:52.700 --> 46:54.220
Well, you lost...

46:54.220 --> 46:54.860
Seven.

46:54.860 --> 46:56.220
And that took you to...

46:56.220 --> 46:57.100
Twelve.

46:57.100 --> 46:57.980
Which is a...

46:57.980 --> 46:58.940
Breaking point.

46:58.940 --> 46:59.440
So...

47:04.060 --> 47:05.180
Yeah, let's start with...

47:05.180 --> 47:07.020
You know, I just thought of it.

47:07.020 --> 47:08.860
It's life-ruining and it's perfect.

47:08.860 --> 47:09.580
Oh, great.

47:09.580 --> 47:11.580
Julius is afraid of working out.

47:11.580 --> 47:12.620
He's afraid of the gym.

47:12.620 --> 47:13.660
Oh, no.

47:13.660 --> 47:15.900
That's so sad, dude.

47:15.900 --> 47:18.860
He's close to being just completely lost.

47:18.860 --> 47:20.060
Yeah, you're right.

47:20.060 --> 47:20.780
This is the end.

47:20.780 --> 47:21.660
Do you think that's a good one?

47:21.660 --> 47:23.420
Yeah, it's perfect because it's your last one.

47:23.420 --> 47:24.620
Yeah, it's absolutely perfect.

47:24.620 --> 47:25.340
It sucks.

47:25.340 --> 47:25.980
It's perfect.

47:25.980 --> 47:29.260
It's absolutely character-ruining, which is brutal and sad.

47:29.260 --> 47:29.980
I love it.

47:29.980 --> 47:32.460
Yes, that's so funny that you say that.

47:33.420 --> 47:33.920
I love you.

47:37.180 --> 47:39.340
Let's go ahead and fight.

47:39.340 --> 47:40.380
Record it for real.

47:40.380 --> 47:43.180
Fight, flight, or fight, fight, or freeze.

47:43.180 --> 47:44.460
Fight, flight, or freeze.

47:45.340 --> 47:46.620
What am I doing?

47:46.620 --> 47:49.980
You are about to roll a d4 and two d10s.

47:50.780 --> 47:51.660
Really good stuff.

47:52.540 --> 47:53.100
D6, right?

47:53.100 --> 47:56.460
We're pulling a long one here at PTBP tonight.

47:56.460 --> 47:57.580
It's not that bad.

47:57.580 --> 47:57.900
It's not.

47:59.020 --> 48:00.300
You didn't put them in order.

48:00.300 --> 48:01.100
Okay, I'll reroll.

48:03.020 --> 48:03.500
Let's see.

48:03.500 --> 48:04.460
In the situation...

48:05.100 --> 48:07.180
Because I'm not in the situation.

48:07.180 --> 48:08.220
I'm observing it.

48:08.860 --> 48:13.740
Most likely would be freeze, and then flight, and then fight.

48:13.740 --> 48:14.620
Okay, sounds good.

48:15.340 --> 48:16.140
Roll a d6.

48:17.500 --> 48:18.220
One.

48:18.220 --> 48:18.620
Okay.

48:18.620 --> 48:19.340
So fight.

48:19.340 --> 48:19.660
Fight.

48:20.460 --> 48:20.860
Damn.

48:20.860 --> 48:21.660
Who do you attack?

48:22.460 --> 48:22.860
Daddy.

48:25.500 --> 48:27.420
Yep, what do you say as you attack him?

48:27.420 --> 48:33.500
Yeah, so Julius is watching this all happen, and he kind of jumps when the thing jumps at the drone.

48:33.500 --> 48:37.100
And then that physical reaction makes him think,

48:37.100 --> 48:38.780
what the fuck am I looking at?

48:38.780 --> 48:39.420
This is real.

48:40.460 --> 48:43.340
And he doesn't want to see it anymore, so he's gonna just try to

48:43.900 --> 48:49.020
probably violently knock the controller out of Kurt's hand.

48:51.580 --> 48:52.860
That's fucking funny, man.

48:54.140 --> 48:54.860
Thank you.

48:54.860 --> 48:57.660
Yeah, it's all about, you know, making it fun.

48:59.900 --> 49:01.180
Is it good for the story?

49:01.580 --> 49:02.080
Kaka!

49:03.420 --> 49:08.700
Probably hinders what we're able to do, but hey, it's what Julius would do.

49:08.700 --> 49:09.580
It's the moment.

49:09.580 --> 49:10.700
It's what happens.

49:10.700 --> 49:12.460
This is classic what happens.

49:12.460 --> 49:18.140
Yeah, and then definitely he doesn't want to work out anymore.

49:21.020 --> 49:22.300
He's gonna be a sad sack.

49:23.420 --> 49:24.220
A sad sack?

49:26.540 --> 49:27.740
Welcome on back.

49:27.740 --> 49:28.380
Welcome on back.

49:28.380 --> 49:30.220
Oh yeah, you didn't hit yours.

49:30.220 --> 49:30.540
Gotcha.

49:33.660 --> 49:38.380
Joe, you lost more than five grip.

49:39.180 --> 49:43.660
So I would need you to rank fight, flight, and freeze.

49:43.660 --> 49:45.100
Freeze is his most likely.

49:46.060 --> 49:47.980
Flee is his second likely.

49:47.980 --> 49:50.220
And fight is least likely.

49:50.220 --> 49:51.500
Absolutely.

49:51.500 --> 49:53.420
Runaways two or three.

49:53.420 --> 49:54.700
What's the good one?

49:54.700 --> 49:55.580
Four, five, or six.

49:56.940 --> 49:57.260
Six.

49:57.260 --> 49:58.300
It's a sixer.

49:58.300 --> 50:03.900
All right, so you get to freeze while the other two please roll.

50:06.300 --> 50:07.340
Unarmed combat.

50:10.860 --> 50:11.580
I gotta fail.

50:12.140 --> 50:13.020
I gotta fail.

50:13.020 --> 50:15.180
Cal passes, so what he said earlier happens.

50:16.460 --> 50:17.580
Punches Kurt in the face.

50:18.700 --> 50:26.380
Which literally knocks him so far out of the way that when Julius goes to knock the drone

50:26.380 --> 50:31.580
out of his hands, you've already taken him way down.

50:31.580 --> 50:32.620
Like he was hunched.

50:33.180 --> 50:35.100
He was like sitting on his feet kind of.

50:35.100 --> 50:37.500
Oh yeah, this is a sucker punch.

50:38.140 --> 50:38.780
Complete.

50:39.900 --> 50:40.620
Super rude.

50:41.900 --> 50:43.020
Top notch rude.

50:43.020 --> 50:44.860
If you could roll a D4.

50:45.500 --> 50:46.460
It's so funny.

50:47.100 --> 50:47.600
Four?

50:49.020 --> 50:49.820
Oh my god.

50:50.540 --> 50:57.580
It's so funny that Kurt is just like controlling the drone and is now getting pummeled.

50:59.980 --> 51:03.020
He did so little of anything.

51:05.340 --> 51:07.820
We saw something so scary we had to punch you.

51:13.820 --> 51:14.940
Oh my god.

51:14.940 --> 51:19.420
And so Stevie's screaming like, what are you doing?

51:19.500 --> 51:20.300
What was that?

51:20.300 --> 51:20.940
What are you doing?

51:20.940 --> 51:21.740
It's these fucking drones.

51:21.740 --> 51:23.900
They're gonna take all our fucking jobs.

51:23.900 --> 51:25.420
And nobody needs to see that shit.

51:32.140 --> 51:33.260
Technology, technology.

51:33.260 --> 51:35.580
Beck, you and I just used to go out with our fucking cameras.

51:35.580 --> 51:36.080
Hold on.

51:39.420 --> 51:40.540
It would just be you and me.

51:42.460 --> 51:44.220
That's all we needed to break a story, right?

51:45.020 --> 51:50.940
Beck is staring down into the screen and making maybe some back of the throat noises.

51:52.380 --> 51:54.700
Turn that fucking camera off.

51:54.700 --> 52:00.140
As you scream that you're looking at this screen and the drone went all herky jerky

52:00.140 --> 52:03.340
when your boy daddy got knocked to the ground.

52:03.340 --> 52:10.860
And so the last thing this camera sees before you're turning it off is this creature

52:11.820 --> 52:12.940
which you see now.

52:13.500 --> 52:19.660
It's a person but its eyes are like too high on its face and kind of

52:19.660 --> 52:24.140
a little bit further out and its ears are on the top of its head.

52:24.140 --> 52:25.660
It's a fucking koala bear.

52:26.780 --> 52:28.940
And its nose is like dark.

52:31.100 --> 52:35.020
Cal kicks that like screen like the monitor into the river.

52:35.020 --> 52:40.620
It's looking curiously into the camera and like that image twitches on the screen.

52:41.100 --> 52:44.860
You all see as it flies slow-mo through the air.

52:46.060 --> 52:47.660
A block away into the river.

52:47.660 --> 52:49.980
Yeah, he's an ex-football star.

52:50.860 --> 52:52.140
Or the trash or whatever the fuck.

52:52.700 --> 52:54.140
Oh yeah, directly in the trash.

52:54.140 --> 52:54.700
Whatever.

52:54.700 --> 52:57.340
That's a big pile of garbage on the city streets.

52:58.140 --> 52:59.900
Beck's eyes don't follow it.

52:59.900 --> 53:03.740
They remain staring now at the ground where that screen used to be.

53:03.740 --> 53:06.060
Cal kind of composes himself.

53:06.060 --> 53:09.420
He shudders and like his whole body shakes.

53:09.500 --> 53:09.980
And he says,

53:10.700 --> 53:11.200
Kurt,

53:12.700 --> 53:13.200
Daddy,

53:14.380 --> 53:15.420
I'm really sorry.

53:16.060 --> 53:17.500
Don't tell anybody about this.

53:20.620 --> 53:23.660
Why, why did you do, why did you do that, man?

53:24.540 --> 53:28.300
Why, why would you do that, man?

53:30.380 --> 53:33.260
You're a creepy asshole but that didn't justify what I did to you.

53:33.980 --> 53:36.220
My friend, Dr. Brock Hargrave.

53:37.420 --> 53:37.740
Yeah?

53:37.740 --> 53:38.540
Yeah, it was good.

53:38.540 --> 53:39.040
Okay.

53:41.100 --> 53:43.260
My friend, Dr. Bark, Brock Hargrave.

53:46.540 --> 53:55.180
My friend, Dr. Bark Hargrave is missing his shovel and possibly both limbs if he's even alive.

53:55.820 --> 53:58.220
I'm going to go to the foundry and have a fucking drink.

53:59.020 --> 54:02.860
You guys are walking back to the van and Beck is still staring down at the ground.

54:03.580 --> 54:04.080
Beck.

54:04.940 --> 54:05.440
Come on.

54:07.020 --> 54:07.740
Oh yeah.

54:07.740 --> 54:09.180
And he jumps along behind him.

54:09.180 --> 54:10.380
And Julius looks at him.

54:10.940 --> 54:12.540
Did you get that on camera?

54:13.740 --> 54:14.300
Oh shit.

54:27.020 --> 54:31.340
Cal like throws $200 from his wallet down on top of Kurt.

54:32.220 --> 54:34.700
It says, get a new one, drone boy.

54:37.740 --> 54:43.580
He can cut that and play it at the end or whatever.

54:47.980 --> 54:50.220
No, I'm doing like six endings on that.

54:52.460 --> 54:56.620
Julius is like, damn, does an underwater drone only cost $200?

54:59.420 --> 55:00.940
Cal sniffs the bag.

55:07.740 --> 55:18.940
Four.

55:24.460 --> 55:28.940
Cause my life is great.

55:37.740 --> 55:46.220
C A N City Action News.
