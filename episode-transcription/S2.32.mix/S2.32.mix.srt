1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
Slip in some slop, y'all.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:14,080
It's Wolf the Dog, the DJ Supreme from the radio station formerly and currently known as 694.2 PTBP.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:21,540
And I am here to give your ears a little butterfly kiss, but with my vocal cords.

4
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:28,360
And speaking of things that are right, this Howlin' with Wolf is from Harley in Southampton, England,

5
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,800
who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod,

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:39,720
a worthwhile thing you can do, too, regardless of if you have a cool name and or are from a cool port city.

7
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,680
You can still share the new promo video and tag at Pretending Pod.

8
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,640
Harley from Southampton, England writes,

9
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:07,720
And scrubbing Luz seems a bit less daunting while I have Keith Beans being an absolute mess in my headphones.

10
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:15,800
Sometimes I do get strange looks when I start laughing out loud in the middle of a shift, but it's a small price to pay.

11
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,480
Keep it up, guys. You make a lot of people really happy.

12
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,880
And Wolf, keep on howlin'.

13
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,600
I look forward to your dulcet tones at the start of every episode.

14
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:36,120
Oh, and a look out for my upcoming post-apocalyptic gamebook, I guess, with Savage Realms gamebooks?

15
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,400
Love, Harley from Southampton, England, xxx.

16
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,200
Now, Harley, did you give ol' Wolfy an owoo?

17
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,960
Owooooo!

18
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,400
My lord, do I love a good howl with me, Wolf.

19
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,760
Thanks for the kind words, especially the ones that are about yours truly.

20
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:08,840
If you want to write up something for your slippy, sloppy wolf to howl, just tag at Pretending Pod on Twitter or Instagram,

21
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,160
tag Pretending To Be People on Facebook, and tag user slash Pretending To Be People on Reddit.

22
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:23,960
Or write a five-star review on the podcast app of your choice and get that delicious evidence before my sloppy wet eyes.

23
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,560
And it's never been easier to share something around,

24
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:35,400
because Pretending To Be People collabed with a wildly talented film production team called Mood Ring Films.

25
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:44,600
And together, they created a promo video that turned out well beyond the PTBP crew's most auspicious dreams.

26
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,560
So just, uh, share that, and tag at Pretending Pod, and you're good to go.

27
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,760
You can, uh, you can do that now. Go on, I'll wait.

28
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,240
Oh, you need the link. That's what you're telling me. Well, guess where the link is.

29
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,720
That's right, the links are in the show notes.

30
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,400
Pretty cool news about that promo video, huh?

31
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,600
And that weren't even the news.

32
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:17,240
Last time, Cal Colorado smelled a smeared waxy substance left behind at the scene at the Zeitgeist.

33
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,200
And he determined that it smelled like some moron's earwax,

34
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,600
which was an enormous letdown, given that Julius and Stevie said they smelled God.

35
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:34,520
And Beck claimed he saw visions of the wet energy and the lightning tornado.

36
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:40,920
After another round of sniffs, Beck witnessed even more unnatural activity.

37
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:47,480
Julius saw a blood moat above train tracks in the upside-down church in Grover's Gorge.

38
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,600
And Cal smelled earwax again.

39
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,200
Oh, what? Hold on there.

40
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,600
Being handed a note by my producer, which is frankly horrible.

41
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,520
Terrible smell, cold hand. Five stars.

42
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:08,360
The note says that Thomas just released the finale of his Oops All Pettymores campaign over on the Patreon.

43
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,560
That's right, all six parts of The Lost Treasure of John Lee Pettymore,

44
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:20,120
including the two-part finale, part six, part one, and part six, part two,

45
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:28,200
are now available in edited audio format at patreon.com slash pretending pod.

46
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,120
And these were edited by the Thomas himself.

47
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,120
And let me just say, pretty solid work there, Thomas.

48
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,720
Well done, boy.

49
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:45,000
So if you want to listen to the six part seven episode scenario that Thomas ran,

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,880
which is a wild continuation of a region of contention story,

51
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,520
you can get access for five bucks, five US dollars.

52
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,640
And you can watch the very strange, sometimes partially cosplayed,

53
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:07,560
VOD BTS streams of the Patreon recording process for fifteen dollars.

54
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,840
Which just so happens to be the cost of a nice lunch sometimes, which is nice.

55
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:19,480
But this is like hours upon hours of nasty streams from these dudes at their weirdest.

56
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,320
Anyway, check it on out.

57
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,720
It's a solid little horrible story.

58
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,480
Now you know I'm not gonna say where the links are.

59
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,160
You're gonna say it in your head in this moment of silence.

60
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:39,240
The word segue looks like you should say it seg, which is the singular of sex.

61
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,200
Last thing, if you want to submit your interpretation of the wet energy,

62
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,080
or the lightning tornado, or the blood moat in the upside down church,

63
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:55,640
in the ongoing fan art contest slash drawing, you have until July 14th to enter.

64
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:02,840
We got some incredible work so far from illustrations, to fanfic, to an original song,

65
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,920
to even embroidery.

66
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,400
And we're just beside ourselves.

67
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,960
And if you need some more ideas, no one has sent in cosplay,

68
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,920
or a recreation of the sitting while walking dance from the calzone.

69
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,920
And I sure would like to laugh at that.

70
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,800
Just the idea.

71
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,320
Damn, that's silly.

72
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:29,160
But really, it's time for a hot new ditty that'll make you huff and puff, daddy.

73
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,760
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

74
00:06:46,920 --> 00:07:00,760
Because my life is great and it's all my fault.

75
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,440
Good energy.

76
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,200
What else we got?

77
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,200
What else we got?

78
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,280
How about them cardinals?

79
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,640
Man, pretty mixed bag.

80
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,360
I just opened up an orange filled with tiny products.

81
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,800
That was fun.

82
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,440
Wait, what?

83
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,560
There was an orange.

84
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,880
Your wife said open this orange and I opened it and there's tiny products inside.

85
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,760
They said open this orange right in front of Thomas and don't offer him a chance to open

86
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,080
any of the five slices, even though there's ten total between the two of us.

87
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,640
And we're going to do this and we're going to laugh at his pain.

88
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,600
Had Thomas...

89
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,720
I just thought that was weird.

90
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,200
Had Thomas not been staring at a puzzle and said like,

91
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,480
Oh, can I open one?

92
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,640
Then you would open more than one, probably.

93
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,120
I shouldn't have to ask.

94
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,840
That's...

95
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,800
Oh, wow.

96
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,880
I shouldn't have to assume what you want to do.

97
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,960
No, you should.

98
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,600
At all times.

99
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:16,760
Why aren't you thinking about Thomas all the time?

100
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,360
No, this is not...

101
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,520
I was like, I could be offered an orange.

102
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,680
I wasn't actually mad, but I thought it was fun to do.

103
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,120
But you started thinking about it early in the orange filling process.

104
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,400
Ten little orange slices.

105
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,760
That is true.

106
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,960
There's ten chances.

107
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,040
He's starting to count on his fingers.

108
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,240
And then looking at the ceiling.

109
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,720
Oh, yeah.

110
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,680
Almond breeze, huh?

111
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,640
What if I open one?

112
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,520
Maybe it would be cool.

113
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,960
I guess if they stop now and offer me one, I could still even it out and get three in.

114
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,240
I just wanted one.

115
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,560
Thomas, you want to open one?

116
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,320
We didn't know, unfortunately.

117
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,800
I don't think it crossed either one of our minds.

118
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,240
That's my whole point, clearly.

119
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,880
But let me tell you, we did get some Oscar Mayer wieners.

120
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,960
We got some oven roasted turkey breasts.

121
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,000
All tiny, huh?

122
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,640
So tiny.

123
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,680
How small are we talking?

124
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,120
We're talking not big.

125
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,840
We're not even talking normal size.

126
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,000
If you took a product and you shrunk it down like Honey, I Shrunk Your Products, it's that.

127
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,920
Maybe it is all leading up to...

128
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,480
It's all promotion for a movie.

129
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,440
Everything's promotion.

130
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,880
God, it sounds so much fun to open one of those.

131
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,840
Actually, hold on.

132
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,200
Joe and I are upset, too.

133
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,200
That you didn't get oranges?

134
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,840
Yeah.

135
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,720
It's your wife.

136
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,920
We weren't even aware of the phone we were missing.

137
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,640
Bring it up.

138
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,520
Here's how it happened.

139
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,520
Which is worse if you think about it.

140
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,000
I left.

141
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,920
There's five people in this house right now, so that could have been two for everybody.

142
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,760
Yeah, that would have been an even number.

143
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:54,440
I emerged from the bathroom and I started looking through the tiny things and she said,

144
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,720
oh, look what I have.

145
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,560
And she went and got two packages of tiny things and said, do you want to open this with me?

146
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,600
Stop defending that woman.

147
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm not.

148
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,280
I'm putting blame on her.

149
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,040
She was the one that went to get them.

150
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,480
She could have came in, knocked down here.

151
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,880
I think we're all in agreement that this is Taylor's fault.

152
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:14,040
Guys, do you want to stop recording and open up two slices of oranges each?

153
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,200
Can you imagine if we were in the middle of recording and she did come in?

154
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,000
Could have been an all-time great episode moment.

155
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,520
She took something from thousands of listeners, too.

156
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,080
Damn, dude.

157
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,240
That would have been our dragons are spooky of season two.

158
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,080
Oh, sorry for the season one call back.

159
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,840
Those of you who haven't made it back there, but if you are listening to this and you haven't

160
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,920
listened to season one, what are you doing?

161
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,760
Come on, check it out.

162
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,520
I will say highlight of my week so far, um, opening up five slices.

163
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,400
Oh man, let's dive into the deep sleepy slumber.

164
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,200
Let's get into this boring shit so I can go buy some more.

165
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,760
It is the morning of Thursday, July 7th.

166
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,040
Right now, can you put in the music?

167
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:23,320
That's like like the morning music, the morning music.

168
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,480
It's like birds are chirping on the show and they play that same song for every show ever.

169
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,400
Do you know what I'm talking about?

170
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:31,800
I do.

171
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,480
Is it like the Vivaldi?

172
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,920
Is it trying to remember what it was?

173
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,000
Cause I used to know it's, I think it's called like dawn, something morning, morning,

174
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,120
dawn or something like that.

175
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,760
It's a classical piece that ended up being used.

176
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,360
Oh, it's a classical piece.

177
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,720
Is it bittersweet symphony?

178
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,400
Yeah, that's it.

179
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:47,880
That's it.

180
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,480
No shit.

181
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,840
I think it's called morning wood.

182
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,000
No, that's what it.

183
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,640
That's what it feels like to have morning wood.

184
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,040
I know it's morning.

185
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,280
And a bird comes in and perches on it.

186
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,680
Horror podcast, horror podcast, horror podcast.

187
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,680
What if a woodpecker pecked your pecker?

188
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,640
But no one wakes up to a woodpecker pecking at their pecker.

189
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,600
Julius wakes up in his mind.

190
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,400
Morningwood is playing and then he's like, uh oh.

191
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,000
And Beck Wilder wakes up.

192
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,200
I think probably still covered in equipment.

193
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,160
Yeah, definitely.

194
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,280
His headphones have kind of slacked off on his head, kind of around his face and eyes.

195
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,520
And he's got his cameras resting on his chest.

196
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,080
And he looks disheveled like he'd had a fiffle night's sleep.

197
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,280
And Cal Colorado wakes up in his own bedroom.

198
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,000
No, he wakes up on the couch in his den and he's not spilled the glass of scotch,

199
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,600
but it is set like far closer to the edge of the table than he would normally countenance.

200
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:21,880
And he kind of snorts and the Bible is still open in his hand and he's

201
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,040
underlined, thou shalt not kill.

202
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,840
And he's thinking about that.

203
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,480
As he walks downstairs, probably a couple of hours before

204
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,560
either of your wake up scenes happens to start cooking everybody waffles and eggs.

205
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,960
Probably with a vegan option for Stevie.

206
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,320
Oh, that's very kind.

207
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,720
And this is how you know that we've got real role playing going on,

208
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,360
because I know that Thomas makes damn good pancakes.

209
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,480
So for you to go with waffles...

210
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,520
I'm a pancake man.

211
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,400
I'm a pancake man.

212
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,760
Cal is a waffle man.

213
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,720
And I stick to the character, folks.

214
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,840
Character choice.

215
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,340
That's right.

216
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,440
After I dropped off that weirdo, I went to fucking Waffle House and got the All-Star Special.

217
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:06,840
Oh, wow.

218
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,640
It was good.

219
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,520
Yeah, hell yeah.

220
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,280
The weirdo paid me to get waffles.

221
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:10,600
Nice.

222
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,000
Nice.

223
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,360
Some things even out.

224
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,400
Imagine if they served pancakes there though, you know?

225
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,760
They get so mad if you ask.

226
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,120
This is a waffle house!

227
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,080
Where are your manners?

228
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,000
That's the Grumpet Palace.

229
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:33,960
So yeah.

230
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,640
Beck follows his nose like a cartoon character floating out of the couch and into the kitchen.

231
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,760
Whoa, Cal.

232
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,440
You doing your famous waffles?

233
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,720
I mean, I almost said pancakes.

234
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,160
You're not a pancake guy.

235
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,960
Oh, I mean, I can make a mean cake when I have to, but...

236
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,320
No, Emeril taught me how to make these waffles.

237
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:51,880
Oh, bam!

238
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:04,600
Beck kind of takes a plate and sidles up next to the waffle maker, just like ready to be

239
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,800
served a hot one.

240
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,400
Hey, did you sleep okay?

241
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,600
I slept pretty fine.

242
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,360
You know, a good three and a half hours.

243
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,000
Pretty typical.

244
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,040
Pretty typical.

245
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,400
Three and a half, dude.

246
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,840
I don't know how you do it.

247
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,280
I think most people are like this.

248
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,800
Not me, man.

249
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:23,080
You know, I tend to find, you know, sure, people at work may grumble every now and then,

250
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,000
but you know, all of us kind of love when we just really get together and push through

251
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,280
working through the night and everything.

252
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,040
Don't you feel that way?

253
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,600
I mean, there is...

254
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,120
Don't you feel energized by that?

255
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,440
There's some camaraderie that I like there for sure, but no, I don't like it.

256
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:44,440
As this just then Julius comes like lunging into the room, like doing lunging.

257
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:53,000
Bec, Cal looks confused and a little hurt and he goes, Julius, would you like the first

258
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,400
waffle?

259
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,080
Oh, hell yeah.

260
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,480
Oh, I mean, I was okay.

261
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,160
Oh yeah, that'll be a couple minutes, Bec.

262
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,520
Julius gobbled it down.

263
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,240
He's hungry.

264
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,280
Does Cal Keurig or make a pot of coffee?

265
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:18,440
He's got an old shitty coffee maker from the nineties that he used like in his office that

266
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,800
he still like, it's his old reliable and there's a pot of that for sure.

267
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,640
And there's probably like three other very expensive devices for making any kind of

268
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,480
little espresso or Chemex pour over.

269
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:31,980
Yeah.

270
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,400
Aeropress tubes and shit.

271
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,440
He's got a Slayer in his kitchen.

272
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,920
Shout out to all my coffee freaks out there.

273
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,200
Can I, can I grab an energy drink?

274
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,360
Last time I was here, you said you kept them stocked just in case we wanted one.

275
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,560
In case Beck wanted one.

276
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,160
If you, yeah.

277
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,160
Yeah, I mean, I mean, he opens it up and there's like 23 and he's like, yeah, there should

278
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,640
be enough.

279
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,680
I figured, you know, I was first waffle boy, so I felt like maybe I'd ask.

280
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,360
I was first waffle boy.

281
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:15,320
Beck is pouring himself a cup of coffee and he is grabbing a energy also and is cracking

282
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,360
it and he's double fisting his wake up juice.

283
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,520
Beck, will you give me, toss me one of those.

284
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,280
Julius, do you, do you like to work late?

285
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,320
Well, it depends.

286
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:28,280
Uh, you know, usually throughout my life, there's no like real hours on what I do.

287
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,560
So, uh, it's not really a question of whether I like doing it, but I do, I do it.

288
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:33,800
Okay.

289
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,920
But you've enjoyed your time at city action news, right?

290
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,960
Grinding for?

291
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,760
The truth?

292
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:39,640
Yeah.

293
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,120
I mean, for the week or so that I've been here, it's been great.

294
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,720
I wouldn't want to do it all the time though.

295
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,560
I don't think he kind of narrows his eyes.

296
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,200
Two weeks.

297
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,240
He narrows his eyes, but he doesn't yank the waffle from here.

298
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,360
I mean, if we're going to can is like everything we've been doing for the last two weeks.

299
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,520
Yeah, no, I would never want to stop it.

300
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,240
Okay.

301
00:17:59,240 --> 00:17:59,560
Yeah.

302
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,120
Yeah.

303
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,160
It's important work.

304
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,200
Glad you feel that way.

305
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,920
Eat up.

306
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,120
You'll need the energy.

307
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,840
Yum, yum, yum.

308
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,400
Beck, I've got a hot, fresh one right here for you.

309
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,200
Yeah.

310
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,120
Has anybody seen Stevie yet this morning?

311
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,520
Door was closed when you walked down the hallway.

312
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,360
Cow like walks straight down there and knocks too loud.

313
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,520
Not like mean, but just oblivious.

314
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,760
Hey, sweetie.

315
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,120
Uh, I mean, sorry, Stevie.

316
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,720
Breakfast is ready.

317
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,400
Um, so just come on out.

318
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,480
Rest of the cruise.

319
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:29,960
Yeah.

320
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,240
Hot, hot, fresh waffles, uh, vegan options.

321
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,480
I think I remember that you were maybe that.

322
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:35,880
Thank you.

323
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,440
Yeah.

324
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,600
You can hear them laughing, uh, as they wake up and come to.

325
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,480
Yeah, be there.

326
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,600
Be there in a minute.

327
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,480
Cow like stops and sniffs and he's like, Stevie, could you, you know, vape out the window?

328
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,680
I guess it's been a weird, all right.

329
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

330
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:53,640
Sorry.

331
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,040
Sorry.

332
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,840
Thank you.

333
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,840
Uh, when you get back to the kitchen, uh, Beck's plate is like a swimming pool with

334
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,680
some waffle in it of syrup.

335
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,880
That's how you do it, dude.

336
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,680
Are you guys ready for, you know, D day?

337
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,520
Daddy day.

338
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,240
K day.

339
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,800
Kurt day.

340
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,720
Stop guys.

341
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,120
Come on.

342
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,840
Well, I guess, are you guys ready to go down the K hole?

343
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,080
Cal, Cal like winces, but he's like, I'll meet you halfway with that one.

344
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,240
We're going to go down the K hole.

345
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,480
He might even like that.

346
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,640
Maybe he can, maybe we can get him to stop the whole daddy.

347
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,960
Do you know that voice is not real, right?

348
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,520
That's not his real voice.

349
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:44,280
I had no reason to assume that he would have a fake voice, but he sounds twice as old as

350
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:44,760
he looks.

351
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,560
Have you heard his real voice?

352
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,360
What's it sound like?

353
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,400
It's just like a normal, normal kind of a little, you know, shyer.

354
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,320
I don't know that it's not his real voice.

355
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,040
I just assume you're right though.

356
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,960
It does seem like it's putting it on for sure.

357
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,880
He's definitely putting it on a little bit, right?

358
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,680
Yeah.

359
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,040
Stevie's behind you and they say shyer.

360
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,720
Like he sounds like a hobbit.

361
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,840
Have a waffle.

362
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,000
Good morning.

363
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,880
Good morning, Stevie.

364
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,600
Have a waffle.

365
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,440
Not a morning person.

366
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,640
Yeah, me too, dude.

367
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,120
Yeah.

368
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,640
Energy drink helps.

369
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,160
Oh, uh, thanks.

370
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,520
I'll do a coffee.

371
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,440
You know, as you get older, that'll, that'll change.

372
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,440
I used to sleep until seven or eight sometimes.

373
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,680
And I was your hitch.

374
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,800
I heard you guys, you guys talking.

375
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,360
What's the, what's the game plan?

376
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,040
There's a lot going on today.

377
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:43,480
Well, first off we got to, uh, we're meeting, uh, Kurt, Kurt at his K hole at the K hole.

378
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:43,720
Okay.

379
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,440
That's what you were.

380
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,440
So I guess we're going to go do that.

381
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,320
And then after that, what we could, we, we could go to the church at Godel.

382
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,080
We could go to, we could go to the prison to talk to Kaylee silver.

383
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,880
We could, those two sound like other good options.

384
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,280
And then we have that meeting at the foundry.

385
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,680
The underground jazz abode.

386
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,680
Well, and the foundry for lunch.

387
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,240
Right.

388
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,640
Oh yeah.

389
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,000
You guys were going to meet.

390
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,720
What was his name?

391
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,320
Rock Brock Hargrave.

392
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:09,880
Right.

393
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,000
There's a rock guy.

394
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,320
Yeah.

395
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,560
And everyone's looking at Cal.

396
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,320
Didn't you know like,

397
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,360
Oh yeah, yeah, hold on.

398
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,920
And he like, he disappears down the hallway and he comes back a second later and he's

399
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,720
like here.

400
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:27,240
And it's a big picture of him and dr Brock, uh, in like 1999 at a new year's Eve party

401
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,040
in the city.

402
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,920
And he has a shirt on that says new year's Brock and Eve.

403
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,800
Very good.

404
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,480
Yeah.

405
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:44,920
So standing next to a younger Cal Colorado, you see dr Brock Hargrave, who is a tall wiry

406
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,800
man with a short beard and his hands are stained with dirt.

407
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:56,760
Even at this party, uh, he's wearing a flannel shirt, cargo pants, rugged boots.

408
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:04,600
A well worn backpack and a faded gray brown cowboy hat sits top his head.

409
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,000
And you see that he is holding the top of a shovel.

410
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,080
And Cal, you remember him always having that shovel with him.

411
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,080
I remember he always had that shovel with him.

412
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,720
Is that?

413
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,840
And then the camera whip pans over to the shovel that's sitting in the corner of the

414
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,560
breakfast nook in Cal Colorado's home.

415
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:28,760
Cal's eyes dart from the photo in his hand to the, uh, the shovel sitting over in the

416
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,480
nook back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.

417
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,280
And it's like, son of a bitch, that's Brock shovel.

418
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,440
We can give it to him at lunch.

419
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:44,040
Do you think that maybe, maybe one of those pairs of legs was Brock?

420
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,560
It does seem weird that he would leave such a prized possession behind like that.

421
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:58,120
Uh, uh, uh, oh, no.

422
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,960
Well, but yes.

423
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,840
Joe Thomas, I need you to leave the room real quick.

424
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:22,200
I just wanted to check in and make sure that you remember Julius's interaction with Dr.

425
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,400
Brock Hargrave.

426
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,120
Oh shit.

427
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:24,360
No.

428
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,800
So in this moment, it was him with the water features.

429
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,520
Exactly.

430
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:32,920
Fuck.

431
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,720
Okay.

432
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,680
Was that before the haves happened?

433
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,600
That was yesterday before.

434
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,000
Yeah.

435
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,640
Wait.

436
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,760
That happened when I was delivering a package to him.

437
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,000
Right.

438
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,240
Yeah.

439
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,200
A couple of weeks ago.

440
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:44,840
Okay.

441
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,240
Yes.

442
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,160
I hadn't, I hadn't remembered that.

443
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,120
So cool.

444
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,760
Nice.

445
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,440
I will have a sudden realization.

446
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:52,760
Yeah.

447
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,520
Cause the picture sparked your memory.

448
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,480
Absolutely.

449
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,240
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

450
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,040
Squaaaaa.

451
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,080
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

452
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,160
No movement.

453
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,880
Maybe they're listening to bird noises on their phone.

454
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,800
I could not hear your birdies.

455
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,400
They were just listening in through the door and they're like, okay, we got to give it

456
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,800
a minute to act like we too long.

457
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:31,480
And we're zoomed in on Cal Colorado's face as he processes one of many scenarios.

458
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,280
Hold on, Cal.

459
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,680
Can I, can I get a better look at that picture?

460
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,040
Yeah.

461
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:41,880
I I've met him before I met him like a couple of weeks ago.

462
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,440
Okay.

463
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:52,440
At his house, I, I delivered a package to him and he gave me a bag.

464
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,560
Was this for your, your X files?

465
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:55,880
Yeah.

466
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:01,320
I, well, the last time I was at the zeitgeist, I met with X and, and she gave me a package

467
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:06,040
to deliver to him and I, you know, I didn't ask any questions.

468
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,440
I just gave it to him and he gave me a bag and I, I looked at what was in the bag and

469
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:18,120
it was like a rubbing of, of like, I don't know, some like old language or like weird

470
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,440
symbols.

471
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,920
I couldn't really tell what it was and I didn't, you know, I didn't really mess with

472
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,320
it.

473
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,480
I just took that back to my house.

474
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,160
Was there like any information with it or was it like just that?

475
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,280
I didn't really look through.

476
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,160
I didn't want to like make it seem like I had looked through it.

477
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:38,280
I didn't open up the package that, that I gave him either, but maybe X knows something

478
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,000
about it.

479
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,600
I'm worried that Dr.

480
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,400
Brock's not going to make his lunch date with us.

481
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,000
That's kind of what I'm thinking too.

482
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,000
Seeming more and more likely.

483
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,760
Well, clean your plates.

484
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,280
There's starving children in contention.

485
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,720
Thanks, Mr.

486
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,440
Colorado.

487
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,320
You're welcome, Stevie.

488
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,000
Yeah, thanks.

489
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,280
Yeah, they look at everyone else.

490
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,200
Cal, these are the best you've ever done and that is saying something.

491
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,760
Thank you, Beck.

492
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,320
Working with you every day is like the best work I've ever done.

493
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,880
Thanks, man.

494
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,520
You too.

495
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,960
Let's go shoot some holes.

496
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,200
Let's go shoot that fucking kale.

497
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,200
Hands in.

498
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,400
Mighty ducks on three.

499
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,000
One, two, three.

500
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,840
Maybe next time.

501
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,280
City action news on N C A N.

502
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,800
City action news.

503
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:48,680
Cool.

504
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:49,960
Hell yeah.

505
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,560
I always wanted to do that.

506
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,760
Now you have shotgun.

507
00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:05,720
We're here.

508
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,440
That was, yes, that was beautiful.

509
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:15,320
We saw the map from overhead with the fun sound effects and a little animated van.

510
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,880
Yeah, the Mercedes van.

511
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,360
Yeah.

512
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,160
Fuck yeah.

513
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,240
It does a little loop de loop on accident.

514
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:32,120
And we get to the bridge, which, um, has now been completely shut off from traffic.

515
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,720
There's a big pylons in the road.

516
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,160
The big, like heavy orange guys.

517
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,320
They do not need to construct more pylons here.

518
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,480
I don't get that.

519
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,320
I don't get that.

520
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,280
I felt that in my soul.

521
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,280
Julius Chuckles.

522
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,800
It's nothing.

523
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,920
No, it was a good one, Julius.

524
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,640
It was really good.

525
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,600
That was super funny.

526
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:01,880
What?

527
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,920
What's so funny?

528
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,320
Stevie.

529
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,200
What's funny?

530
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,400
He's just really fun.

531
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,200
Tell him, Stevie.

532
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:06,600
Tell him.

533
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:06,840
Yeah.

534
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,560
Describe it.

535
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,600
What does, what does that mean?

536
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,000
I mean, have you played Minecraft?

537
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,040
Yes.

538
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,480
Close.

539
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,320
Yeah, it is.

540
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,680
You got, you got subtract 20 years from that.

541
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,160
Well, subtract one word and add another.

542
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,520
Instead of down up.

543
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,880
Oh man.

544
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,080
I'm so confused.

545
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,040
Not down in a mine, but up amongst the clouds.

546
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,880
Cloudcraft would be dope.

547
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,520
That's cool.

548
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,200
Sounds like a cool game.

549
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,400
I've been playing tears of the kingdom.

550
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,000
It's that's okay.

551
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,280
Gotcha.

552
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,760
Up more up.

553
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,640
What?

554
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,840
Upper than the sky.

555
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,880
Above the sky.

556
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,040
Space craft.

557
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,560
Star craft.

558
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,440
There you go.

559
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,080
Oh yeah.

560
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,400
Okay.

561
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,920
So there's this game that a bunch of people played for like hours on end.

562
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,400
There's pot.

563
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,680
Julius gets out of the car.

564
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,920
Stevie, I think I see Kurt.

565
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,520
So why don't you tell me about it later?

566
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,560
I roll to know about star.

567
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,200
Oh God.

568
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:33,560
And Kurt is waiting for you all in an alleyway and he's on the bridge.

569
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:33,960
Oh no.

570
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,760
An alleyway, like near the bridge and he's locked up.

571
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,200
He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

572
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,800
There's a bunch of blocks.

573
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,240
So you can only get like a block away from the bridge at this point.

574
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,200
And so you can see it from here, but there's no one.

575
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,800
Watching it.

576
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,600
We've got the credentials, even if they were so.

577
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,080
Yeah.

578
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,600
We're the news we're allowed to be anywhere.

579
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,440
Beck is putting on his lanyard that has his press pass in it.

580
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,840
As you lift the lanyard above your head, looking through the hole,

581
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:09,800
you see Kurt kind of waving you over like hurriedly and worriedly.

582
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,240
Hey guys, there's Kurt over there.

583
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,040
We go talk to him.

584
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,920
He's in his thirties.

585
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,800
He looks older.

586
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:19,800
His eyes are sunken in and he's wearing a disheveled can windbreaker.

587
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,840
He's got big curly hair atop his kind of tiny head.

588
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:31,720
Oh, he's got a old TC and polo on underneath the can windbreaker.

589
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,200
And as you notice that Cal, he kind of zips up the windbreaker and is like,

590
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,280
Hey, are you wearing, I've got the drone.

591
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,760
Are you wearing your can colors?

592
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,640
In addition to the city news colors.

593
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,800
No, no, it's not like that.

594
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,760
You cannot solely the can colors like that.

595
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,800
No, no.

596
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,400
At least you zipped up.

597
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,680
I didn't do it.

598
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,960
I just saw you.

599
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,760
And he just stares at you with these sunken in eyes.

600
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,160
Beck, were you filming that?

601
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,720
I got it.

602
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,040
Okay.

603
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,540
Yeah.

604
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:03,820
Fuck.

605
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,000
Drone.

606
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,720
Let's drone.

607
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,200
Let's do it.

608
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,680
Come on.

609
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,560
Okay.

610
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,280
He reaches down into a bowling bag.

611
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:10,760
Nice.

612
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,160
Cool.

613
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,160
Pulls out a drone.

614
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,000
It's like, let's do this.

615
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,120
Let's go.

616
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,720
How did I, it was, it was older.

617
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,480
It was like more like this and just a little sexual undertone.

618
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,960
Do you need to listen to it again?

619
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,800
No, please do.

620
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,160
I'm excited about this.

621
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,360
The last time we had a drone experience, it went well.

622
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:45,080
And the last time, the last time Zach listened to this guy's voice, it, uh, it got used.

623
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,720
So maybe this time a drone will hit him in the fucking throat.

624
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,120
I was doing the city news voice.

625
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,440
So you it's, so it's a, it's a voice.

626
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,320
You admit it's a voice.

627
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,360
I didn't do it.

628
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,920
Cal, Cal, you called it.

629
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,200
That's putting the cows.

630
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,520
Nope.

631
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,080
You got it.

632
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,640
I told you.

633
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,200
You didn't skip out from a mile away.

634
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,960
None of you know what's true.

635
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,880
Just talk, just talk normal.

636
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,680
All right.

637
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,000
All right.

638
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,320
All right.

639
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:11,720
All right.

640
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:17,880
And he is going to drone it up and succeeds.

641
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:27,160
And he flies the drone up and up and up along the buildings on either side of you in this

642
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:33,240
alleyway, old brick architecture with arches over the windows.

643
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,520
And then the drone flies out.

644
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:44,440
In the distance, you see the bridge, you see the city river flowing through wide and vast

645
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:52,920
and dark and strong, and you see the drone follow the path of the road over to the bridge.

646
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:58,440
And then it hovers above the gaping hole.

647
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,840
It's smooth.

648
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:07,640
You've seen it before, but through this lens from the top down, getting the full circumference

649
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:17,560
as the drone continues down, a light turns on the sun still kind of in the corner of

650
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,200
the sky.

651
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:25,400
Hasn't quite lit this far down inside the hole, but the light from the drone shines

652
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:32,440
shines bright below and illuminates crashing waves.

653
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,520
Uh, okay.

654
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,040
Kurt, can it, can it swim?

655
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,120
Yeah.

656
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,200
Go, go down there.

657
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,840
Oh, that's cool.

658
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,760
Descend on my dude.

659
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,400
Yeah.

660
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,360
Submerge.

661
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,480
Don't hit the tugboat.

662
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:47,960
Stop it.

663
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,920
I was doing it.

664
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,360
Okay.

665
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:50,760
Okay.

666
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,320
Okay.

667
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:51,560
Okay.

668
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,840
That goes to grab the controls and I get slapped back.

669
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,360
Julius kind of looks at Kalin back.

670
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,440
He's like, let daddy do his work.

671
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,800
Thank you.

672
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,640
Oh, I can relax my shoulders.

673
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:20,280
And it plunges and the drone is wet and the light kind of flashes, flickers, brushing

674
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:26,440
bubbles, and then you get deeper and the current kind of fades off.

675
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:37,000
And at the bottom of the city river, you see a tugboat that is like moving back and forth

676
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,320
just a little bit, almost like something on the other side is like doing exactly what

677
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,720
Thomas is doing with his hand, which is like wiggling it back and forth.

678
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,880
And it's just rocking.

679
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:58,120
You can only see half of it as the drone descends down one side and makes its way.

680
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:03,160
You see a very sharp circle along the ground.

681
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,360
It's tugboats stuck in a hole.

682
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:13,400
Can you like navigate the drone into the tugboat and then down past the hole and then out

683
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,480
a window of the tugboat beneath the hole?

684
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:15,640
Yeah.

685
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,160
Can you get further into the hole?

686
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,680
That is the coolest thing that you've ever said.

687
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,400
Wow.

688
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,640
My man, first you call me daddy, then you have a cool thought like that.

689
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,960
I mean, you boys could learn a thing or two from this young gentleman.

690
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,080
Julius is like fake smiling and nodding his head.

691
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,520
Yes, we all have a lot to learn from young Julius.

692
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,320
He's a shining bright star at Cannes.

693
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:46,600
His career and, you know, workplace behavior is something we might all strive to emulate,

694
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:46,840
Kurt.

695
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:55,080
Julius's smile gets more fake.

696
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,480
I'm sorry.

697
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:05,400
I didn't mean to, you know, I'm not talking about, you know, uh, the stuff, but you know

698
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:05,880
what, nevermind.

699
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,040
Just can you just send that drone down that fucking hole?

700
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,040
In Julius's mind, he thinks Cal is talking about the fact that he's not going to be the

701
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,480
like lead producer.

702
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,600
That's like what's.

703
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,400
Yeah, because you've, you've wrapped your uncle in a wall of thighs.

704
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,200
Yes.

705
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:24,520
Wow.

706
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:34,920
A beautiful, beautiful sentiment as the camera heads into the tugboat, as Zach watches a

707
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,840
tugboat tour on YouTube.

708
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,960
I can just come out the butt.

709
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,240
I think we all assumed it would come out the butthole.

710
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,740
Yeah.

711
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,000
This guy's really showing me a lot of knobs.

712
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,920
Not interested.

713
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,960
Yeah, it's all in the front.

714
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,080
It's knobs on the front.

715
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,800
Got the bottle on the back.

716
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,920
Aft as they say.

717
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,600
And the drone, you learn a lot from those videos.

718
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,720
Through the sea of knobs.

719
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,920
Delicately avoiding each.

720
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,800
There's so many.

721
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,000
Step here, boy.

722
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,400
That's what Kurt is saying to the camera that he's directing.

723
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:21,000
And looks up and is like, oh, I mean, I mean, oh yeah, the knobs get on through there.

724
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,400
My guy, I was like, no, I kind of thought the pirate thing was a little cool, better

725
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,240
than your usual stick, you know, sex monster or whatever.

726
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,000
Let him focus.

727
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,520
The drone continues.

728
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:46,920
Oh, the drone continues on down into the tugboat and then through the back.

729
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,640
Oh my God.

730
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,760
So many knobs.

731
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,360
And out the other side.

732
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,360
We're through the butt, gentlemen.

733
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,880
The screen that you're watching flickers.

734
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:05,000
And as it flickers, it's like the scene changes completely.

735
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,080
Who changed the channel?

736
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,160
This is a pretty important role.

737
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,120
What are we rolling?

738
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,600
One of you should do it.

739
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,480
No, you're going to roll a specific die for me.

740
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,080
And I'm going to tell you which one.

741
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,120
One momentarily.

742
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:28,920
Okay.

743
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,400
After I find a tugboat butthole chart.

744
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:33,720
Yeah.

745
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,240
I can't find the butthole.

746
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,720
It's the it's right under the poop deck.

747
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,280
I think I got it.

748
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,720
Six.

749
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,640
You can go ahead and roll a D six for me.

750
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,920
Everybody or one person.

751
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,880
Just one person.

752
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,240
Roll them skull boys, Joe.

753
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:51,740
Yeah.

754
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,480
I hope it's good.

755
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,360
I hope it's a six.

756
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,280
It's a three, which is either the middle right in the middle.

757
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,800
Oh my God.

758
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,000
Very cool.

759
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,840
You see three more tugboats.

760
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:13,960
The camera is no longer submerged in water and it is no longer being lit by the light

761
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:21,400
that is shining from off the drone because there is sunlight coming in from the windows

762
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,320
at the top of a gymnasium.

763
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,200
An old timey school gymnasium.

764
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:39,800
You see dust falling in the sun rays that make their way down onto the basketball court.

765
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:48,040
And on the far side, underneath one of the basketball hoops.

766
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:56,440
There's a throne and it's bloody.

767
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:05,400
Double doors open on the right side of this room, opposite from where the sun is coming

768
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:16,440
in and the light hits a young creature, small creature, humanoid, not quite human.

769
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,040
Ears are too high on its head, too round.

770
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:27,960
And it's wearing a school uniform suddenly is sprinting on all fours directly toward

771
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,520
the drone.

772
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:36,200
As it gets closer, you see blood on its face and hands and on the uniform itself.

773
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,480
And I am in a call for a roll.

774
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:44,360
One of you guys should roll for the drone operation here.

775
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:44,860
Okay.

776
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,540
Thomas, go ahead and roll for the drone operation.

777
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,940
Kurt is pretty good.

778
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,060
65.

779
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:52,780
Fuck yeah.

780
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,500
65.

781
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,300
43.

782
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,820
He nimbly fucking.

783
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,660
Oh, maybe it's 21.

784
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,620
Oh, hell yeah.

785
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,180
Yes.

786
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,220
Nimbly.

787
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:06,220
This thing is coming directly toward you.

788
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,940
Oh, yes.

789
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,700
I've got it.

790
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:18,140
And it goes straight up in the air and this thing launches itself off its hind legs to

791
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:22,460
try to grab onto the drone and just barely taps it.

792
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,940
And you get the little wiggle on the camera.

793
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:31,340
The camera is looking down at this thing as it sort of begins to circle and prowl and

794
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,460
looking up.

795
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,740
Just a quick aside, Zach, you know, you control this whole world.

796
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:40,460
Why wasn't the throne and the weird boy covered in, say, chocolate instead of blood?

797
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,200
True.

798
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,580
You have these choices.

799
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,300
That reminds me.

800
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:44,780
Roll grip.

801
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,980
Oh, not a good one for Cal Colorado.

802
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,900
It's a fail for me, Julius.

803
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,180
Beck fails also.

804
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,540
All righty.

805
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,140
Well, I think this is going to be a decently fat one, even though...

806
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,020
And fat grip chair.

807
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:12,460
So I think let's go with a D4 and another D4.

808
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,260
Oh, my.

809
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,140
A two and a four.

810
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,660
That's a three and a four.

811
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,740
A three and a four.

812
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:30,380
I lost seven and that puts me at my breaking point.

813
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,660
I also lost seven and that is a breaking point for Cal.

814
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:37,420
I lost six and it puts me one above my breaking point.

815
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,620
I'm close, but haven't broken.

816
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,300
Oh, my God.

817
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,820
You have 12 grip?

818
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,320
Yes.

819
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,980
Yeah, that actually makes a ton of sense.

820
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:55,020
And funny enough, my next breaking point is at zero.

821
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:55,520
I don't have...

822
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:57,740
Last one.

823
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,260
Last one.

824
00:42:59,260 --> 00:42:59,580
All right.

825
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:07,900
Well, so let's get Joe and Luke to leave the room and we'll start with Thomas here.

826
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,220
Well, well, well.

827
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,660
Hey, Zach, that was really cool.

828
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,340
I like coming down into a gym.

829
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,580
That was not expected and very fucking cool.

830
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:16,080
Hey, thanks.

831
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,820
And I'm scared of the gym.

832
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:31,980
Hey, dude, what do you want to lose your shit about?

833
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,360
I don't know.

834
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,300
When I fail my grip, does that mean I know it's real?

835
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,380
Yeah, I think you do.

836
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,740
I think you know it's real.

837
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,240
Okay.

838
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,620
What's Cal's grip at currently?

839
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,260
35.

840
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,700
Gotten pretty low.

841
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,260
Yeah, that's...

842
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,380
His last fear was about big bodies of water.

843
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,620
So I think we can maybe even just like add on to that.

844
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:58,060
Where now it's like a fear of going down that hole or being sucked down.

845
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,940
A fear of being sucked down holes.

846
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,300
Yeah.

847
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:07,100
Yeah, and like absolutely not getting in water because you'll get sucked down a hole.

848
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:07,580
I don't know.

849
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:11,580
That seems simple, which isn't bad necessarily.

850
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,460
There are lots of holes in all sorts of stuff.

851
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,100
Yeah, I think it's the holes.

852
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,380
I think that's...

853
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:21,020
Anything that's a perfectly round hole, you're just like...

854
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,300
It's got to be pretty massive.

855
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,820
I don't think you're gonna be able to throw any old hole at him,

856
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,500
but unnaturally large and unnaturally smooth holes.

857
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,740
I mean, those are already terrifying, right?

858
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:32,940
Maybe for you.

859
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,900
I don't know what that means.

860
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,220
For me, that's a walk in the park.

861
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,180
Big holes.

862
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,060
Big holes?

863
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,340
Come on, that's Tuesday.

864
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:51,500
He could be afraid of the power of new media.

865
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,060
Drones.

866
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:55,980
Anti-drone.

867
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:56,860
Anti-drone.

868
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,820
It could be anti-Jim, anti-cat boy.

869
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,340
Certainly.

870
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,820
Again, probably just normal.

871
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:09,820
Yeah, I think going anti-new tech would be good.

872
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:10,320
Yeah.

873
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,620
He already doesn't understand a lot of technology.

874
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,500
Now he fears and hates it.

875
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,300
Oh, that sucks.

876
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,700
Now we're getting to the sad part of Cal-Colorado.

877
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,260
That's...

878
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,340
Yes, that's what I don't want to...

879
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,860
Well, that's the end.

880
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,620
I mean, this is where we're going.

881
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,900
He'll find a way out.

882
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,580
Man, he won't...

883
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,100
Maybe through his daughter.

884
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:31,820
Maybe.

885
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:32,860
That'd be cool.

886
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,780
The strength of love, Zach.

887
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:35,100
Man...

888
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:40,540
Do you have the courage to DM a Delta Green game where love conquers all?

889
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,220
Or are you a pussy?

890
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,060
Or are you a fucking little bitch?

891
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,500
All right, so yeah.

892
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,540
That sounds good.

893
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:55,260
He's gonna really want to do things the old way.

894
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:55,740
Okay.

895
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:56,380
He's gonna...

896
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,580
That's perfect for this.

897
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,340
I mean, where we're going, that's...

898
00:45:59,340 --> 00:45:59,840
Boom.

899
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:01,980
Send in a boy.

900
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,140
Preferably, I think, Luke.

901
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,420
Because Joe doesn't have...

902
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:05,900
Oh, wait.

903
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:06,860
No, sit down.

904
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,260
Sit down.

905
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:07,820
Sit back down.

906
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:11,740
Fight, flight, or freeze.

907
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,700
Fight, freeze, flight.

908
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:17,740
Okay.

909
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:18,780
And that's a D6?

910
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:19,260
Yes, sir.

911
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:21,980
Five, so fight.

912
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,420
He punches Kurt in the face.

913
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:27,820
Thank you.

914
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:32,940
Get that drone fucking bullshit out of here.

915
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,140
We don't need to see this shit, Kurt.

916
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:43,580
I'm in trouble.

917
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,260
I hope you've been thinking about what you've done.

918
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,100
I'm in danger.

919
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,220
Well, you lost...

920
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:54,860
Seven.

921
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,220
And that took you to...

922
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,100
Twelve.

923
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:57,980
Which is a...

924
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:58,940
Breaking point.

925
00:46:58,940 --> 00:46:59,440
So...

926
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:05,180
Yeah, let's start with...

927
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,020
You know, I just thought of it.

928
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,860
It's life-ruining and it's perfect.

929
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:09,580
Oh, great.

930
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,580
Julius is afraid of working out.

931
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:12,620
He's afraid of the gym.

932
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:13,660
Oh, no.

933
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,900
That's so sad, dude.

934
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,860
He's close to being just completely lost.

935
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,060
Yeah, you're right.

936
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:20,780
This is the end.

937
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:21,660
Do you think that's a good one?

938
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,420
Yeah, it's perfect because it's your last one.

939
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,620
Yeah, it's absolutely perfect.

940
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:25,340
It sucks.

941
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:25,980
It's perfect.

942
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:29,260
It's absolutely character-ruining, which is brutal and sad.

943
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:29,980
I love it.

944
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,460
Yes, that's so funny that you say that.

945
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:33,920
I love you.

946
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,340
Let's go ahead and fight.

947
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,380
Record it for real.

948
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,180
Fight, flight, or fight, fight, or freeze.

949
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:44,460
Fight, flight, or freeze.

950
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,620
What am I doing?

951
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,980
You are about to roll a d4 and two d10s.

952
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:51,660
Really good stuff.

953
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,100
D6, right?

954
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,460
We're pulling a long one here at PTBP tonight.

955
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,580
It's not that bad.

956
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:57,900
It's not.

957
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:00,300
You didn't put them in order.

958
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,100
Okay, I'll reroll.

959
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:03,500
Let's see.

960
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,460
In the situation...

961
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,180
Because I'm not in the situation.

962
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,220
I'm observing it.

963
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:13,740
Most likely would be freeze, and then flight, and then fight.

964
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:14,620
Okay, sounds good.

965
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,140
Roll a d6.

966
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,220
One.

967
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:18,620
Okay.

968
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:19,340
So fight.

969
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:19,660
Fight.

970
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:20,860
Damn.

971
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:21,660
Who do you attack?

972
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:22,860
Daddy.

973
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,420
Yep, what do you say as you attack him?

974
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:33,500
Yeah, so Julius is watching this all happen, and he kind of jumps when the thing jumps at the drone.

975
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:37,100
And then that physical reaction makes him think,

976
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,780
what the fuck am I looking at?

977
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:39,420
This is real.

978
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:43,340
And he doesn't want to see it anymore, so he's gonna just try to

979
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:49,020
probably violently knock the controller out of Kurt's hand.

980
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,860
That's fucking funny, man.

981
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:54,860
Thank you.

982
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:57,660
Yeah, it's all about, you know, making it fun.

983
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,180
Is it good for the story?

984
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:02,080
Kaka!

985
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:08,700
Probably hinders what we're able to do, but hey, it's what Julius would do.

986
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,580
It's the moment.

987
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,700
It's what happens.

988
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,460
This is classic what happens.

989
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:18,140
Yeah, and then definitely he doesn't want to work out anymore.

990
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,300
He's gonna be a sad sack.

991
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:24,220
A sad sack?

992
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,740
Welcome on back.

993
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:28,380
Welcome on back.

994
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,220
Oh yeah, you didn't hit yours.

995
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:30,540
Gotcha.

996
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:38,380
Joe, you lost more than five grip.

997
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:43,660
So I would need you to rank fight, flight, and freeze.

998
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:45,100
Freeze is his most likely.

999
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,980
Flee is his second likely.

1000
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,220
And fight is least likely.

1001
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,500
Absolutely.

1002
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,420
Runaways two or three.

1003
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,700
What's the good one?

1004
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,580
Four, five, or six.

1005
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:57,260
Six.

1006
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,300
It's a sixer.

1007
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:03,900
All right, so you get to freeze while the other two please roll.

1008
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,340
Unarmed combat.

1009
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:11,580
I gotta fail.

1010
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,020
I gotta fail.

1011
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,180
Cal passes, so what he said earlier happens.

1012
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:17,580
Punches Kurt in the face.

1013
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:26,380
Which literally knocks him so far out of the way that when Julius goes to knock the drone

1014
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:31,580
out of his hands, you've already taken him way down.

1015
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:32,620
Like he was hunched.

1016
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,100
He was like sitting on his feet kind of.

1017
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,500
Oh yeah, this is a sucker punch.

1018
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:38,780
Complete.

1019
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:40,620
Super rude.

1020
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,020
Top notch rude.

1021
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,860
If you could roll a D4.

1022
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,460
It's so funny.

1023
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:47,600
Four?

1024
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:49,820
Oh my god.

1025
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:57,580
It's so funny that Kurt is just like controlling the drone and is now getting pummeled.

1026
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:03,020
He did so little of anything.

1027
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,820
We saw something so scary we had to punch you.

1028
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:14,940
Oh my god.

1029
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:19,420
And so Stevie's screaming like, what are you doing?

1030
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,300
What was that?

1031
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:20,940
What are you doing?

1032
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:21,740
It's these fucking drones.

1033
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,900
They're gonna take all our fucking jobs.

1034
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,420
And nobody needs to see that shit.

1035
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,260
Technology, technology.

1036
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,580
Beck, you and I just used to go out with our fucking cameras.

1037
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:36,080
Hold on.

1038
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:40,540
It would just be you and me.

1039
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,220
That's all we needed to break a story, right?

1040
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:50,940
Beck is staring down into the screen and making maybe some back of the throat noises.

1041
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,700
Turn that fucking camera off.

1042
00:51:54,700 --> 00:52:00,140
As you scream that you're looking at this screen and the drone went all herky jerky

1043
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:03,340
when your boy daddy got knocked to the ground.

1044
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:10,860
And so the last thing this camera sees before you're turning it off is this creature

1045
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:12,940
which you see now.

1046
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:19,660
It's a person but its eyes are like too high on its face and kind of

1047
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:24,140
a little bit further out and its ears are on the top of its head.

1048
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,660
It's a fucking koala bear.

1049
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,940
And its nose is like dark.

1050
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:35,020
Cal kicks that like screen like the monitor into the river.

1051
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:40,620
It's looking curiously into the camera and like that image twitches on the screen.

1052
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:44,860
You all see as it flies slow-mo through the air.

1053
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:47,660
A block away into the river.

1054
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,980
Yeah, he's an ex-football star.

1055
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:52,140
Or the trash or whatever the fuck.

1056
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,140
Oh yeah, directly in the trash.

1057
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:54,700
Whatever.

1058
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,340
That's a big pile of garbage on the city streets.

1059
00:52:58,140 --> 00:52:59,900
Beck's eyes don't follow it.

1060
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:03,740
They remain staring now at the ground where that screen used to be.

1061
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:06,060
Cal kind of composes himself.

1062
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:09,420
He shudders and like his whole body shakes.

1063
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:09,980
And he says,

1064
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:11,200
Kurt,

1065
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:13,200
Daddy,

1066
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:15,420
I'm really sorry.

1067
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,500
Don't tell anybody about this.

1068
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:23,660
Why, why did you do, why did you do that, man?

1069
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:28,300
Why, why would you do that, man?

1070
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:33,260
You're a creepy asshole but that didn't justify what I did to you.

1071
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:36,220
My friend, Dr. Brock Hargrave.

1072
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:37,740
Yeah?

1073
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:38,540
Yeah, it was good.

1074
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:39,040
Okay.

1075
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,260
My friend, Dr. Bark, Brock Hargrave.

1076
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:55,180
My friend, Dr. Bark Hargrave is missing his shovel and possibly both limbs if he's even alive.

1077
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:58,220
I'm going to go to the foundry and have a fucking drink.

1078
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:02,860
You guys are walking back to the van and Beck is still staring down at the ground.

1079
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:04,080
Beck.

1080
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:05,440
Come on.

1081
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:07,740
Oh yeah.

1082
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,180
And he jumps along behind him.

1083
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:10,380
And Julius looks at him.

1084
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,540
Did you get that on camera?

1085
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:14,300
Oh shit.

1086
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:31,340
Cal like throws $200 from his wallet down on top of Kurt.

1087
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,700
It says, get a new one, drone boy.

1088
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:43,580
He can cut that and play it at the end or whatever.

1089
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:50,220
No, I'm doing like six endings on that.

1090
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:56,620
Julius is like, damn, does an underwater drone only cost $200?

1091
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,940
Cal sniffs the bag.

1092
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:18,940
Four.

1093
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:28,940
Cause my life is great.

1094
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:46,220
