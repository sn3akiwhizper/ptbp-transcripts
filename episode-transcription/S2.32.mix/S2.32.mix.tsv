0	2340	Slip in some slop, y'all.
2340	14080	It's Wolf the Dog, the DJ Supreme from the radio station formerly and currently known as 694.2 PTBP.
14080	21540	And I am here to give your ears a little butterfly kiss, but with my vocal cords.
21540	28360	And speaking of things that are right, this Howlin' with Wolf is from Harley in Southampton, England,
28360	31800	who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod,
31800	39720	a worthwhile thing you can do, too, regardless of if you have a cool name and or are from a cool port city.
39720	44680	You can still share the new promo video and tag at Pretending Pod.
44680	47640	Harley from Southampton, England writes,
58360	67720	And scrubbing Luz seems a bit less daunting while I have Keith Beans being an absolute mess in my headphones.
67720	75800	Sometimes I do get strange looks when I start laughing out loud in the middle of a shift, but it's a small price to pay.
75800	79480	Keep it up, guys. You make a lot of people really happy.
79480	81880	And Wolf, keep on howlin'.
81880	86600	I look forward to your dulcet tones at the start of every episode.
86600	96120	Oh, and a look out for my upcoming post-apocalyptic gamebook, I guess, with Savage Realms gamebooks?
96120	101400	Love, Harley from Southampton, England, xxx.
101400	106200	Now, Harley, did you give ol' Wolfy an owoo?
106200	109960	Owooooo!
109960	115400	My lord, do I love a good howl with me, Wolf.
115400	120760	Thanks for the kind words, especially the ones that are about yours truly.
120760	128840	If you want to write up something for your slippy, sloppy wolf to howl, just tag at Pretending Pod on Twitter or Instagram,
128840	135160	tag Pretending To Be People on Facebook, and tag user slash Pretending To Be People on Reddit.
135160	143960	Or write a five-star review on the podcast app of your choice and get that delicious evidence before my sloppy wet eyes.
143960	147560	And it's never been easier to share something around,
147560	155400	because Pretending To Be People collabed with a wildly talented film production team called Mood Ring Films.
155400	164600	And together, they created a promo video that turned out well beyond the PTBP crew's most auspicious dreams.
164600	169560	So just, uh, share that, and tag at Pretending Pod, and you're good to go.
169560	172760	You can, uh, you can do that now. Go on, I'll wait.
172760	177240	Oh, you need the link. That's what you're telling me. Well, guess where the link is.
177240	181720	That's right, the links are in the show notes.
181720	185400	Pretty cool news about that promo video, huh?
185400	188600	And that weren't even the news.
188600	197240	Last time, Cal Colorado smelled a smeared waxy substance left behind at the scene at the Zeitgeist.
197240	202200	And he determined that it smelled like some moron's earwax,
202280	208600	which was an enormous letdown, given that Julius and Stevie said they smelled God.
208600	214520	And Beck claimed he saw visions of the wet energy and the lightning tornado.
214520	220920	After another round of sniffs, Beck witnessed even more unnatural activity.
220920	227480	Julius saw a blood moat above train tracks in the upside-down church in Grover's Gorge.
227480	230600	And Cal smelled earwax again.
230600	232200	Oh, what? Hold on there.
232200	236600	Being handed a note by my producer, which is frankly horrible.
236600	240520	Terrible smell, cold hand. Five stars.
240520	248360	The note says that Thomas just released the finale of his Oops All Pettymores campaign over on the Patreon.
248360	253560	That's right, all six parts of The Lost Treasure of John Lee Pettymore,
253560	260120	including the two-part finale, part six, part one, and part six, part two,
260200	268200	are now available in edited audio format at patreon.com slash pretending pod.
268200	272120	And these were edited by the Thomas himself.
272120	276120	And let me just say, pretty solid work there, Thomas.
276120	277720	Well done, boy.
279160	285000	So if you want to listen to the six part seven episode scenario that Thomas ran,
285000	289880	which is a wild continuation of a region of contention story,
289880	294520	you can get access for five bucks, five US dollars.
294520	299640	And you can watch the very strange, sometimes partially cosplayed,
299640	307560	VOD BTS streams of the Patreon recording process for fifteen dollars.
307560	312840	Which just so happens to be the cost of a nice lunch sometimes, which is nice.
312840	319480	But this is like hours upon hours of nasty streams from these dudes at their weirdest.
319640	321320	Anyway, check it on out.
321320	323720	It's a solid little horrible story.
324280	327480	Now you know I'm not gonna say where the links are.
327480	331160	You're gonna say it in your head in this moment of silence.
332920	339240	The word segue looks like you should say it seg, which is the singular of sex.
339240	344200	Last thing, if you want to submit your interpretation of the wet energy,
344200	349080	or the lightning tornado, or the blood moat in the upside down church,
349080	355640	in the ongoing fan art contest slash drawing, you have until July 14th to enter.
355640	362840	We got some incredible work so far from illustrations, to fanfic, to an original song,
362840	364920	to even embroidery.
364920	367400	And we're just beside ourselves.
367400	371960	And if you need some more ideas, no one has sent in cosplay,
371960	376920	or a recreation of the sitting while walking dance from the calzone.
376920	378920	And I sure would like to laugh at that.
380600	381800	Just the idea.
381800	383320	Damn, that's silly.
383320	389160	But really, it's time for a hot new ditty that'll make you huff and puff, daddy.
389160	394760	It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.
406920	420760	Because my life is great and it's all my fault.
433800	434440	Good energy.
436920	440200	What else we got?
443000	444200	What else we got?
446920	448280	How about them cardinals?
448280	449640	Man, pretty mixed bag.
450760	454360	I just opened up an orange filled with tiny products.
455000	455800	That was fun.
455800	456440	Wait, what?
456440	457560	There was an orange.
457560	461880	Your wife said open this orange and I opened it and there's tiny products inside.
463240	466760	They said open this orange right in front of Thomas and don't offer him a chance to open
466760	471080	any of the five slices, even though there's ten total between the two of us.
471080	473640	And we're going to do this and we're going to laugh at his pain.
473640	474600	Had Thomas...
474600	475720	I just thought that was weird.
475720	478200	Had Thomas not been staring at a puzzle and said like,
478200	479480	Oh, can I open one?
479480	481640	Then you would open more than one, probably.
482760	484120	I shouldn't have to ask.
484120	484840	That's...
484840	485800	Oh, wow.
485800	487880	I shouldn't have to assume what you want to do.
489000	489960	No, you should.
489960	490600	At all times.
490600	496760	Why aren't you thinking about Thomas all the time?
496760	498360	No, this is not...
498360	500520	I was like, I could be offered an orange.
500520	502680	I wasn't actually mad, but I thought it was fun to do.
504280	508120	But you started thinking about it early in the orange filling process.
508120	509400	Ten little orange slices.
510040	510760	That is true.
510760	511960	There's ten chances.
511960	514040	He's starting to count on his fingers.
514040	515240	And then looking at the ceiling.
516440	517720	Oh, yeah.
517720	518680	Almond breeze, huh?
518680	519640	What if I open one?
519640	520520	Maybe it would be cool.
522200	527960	I guess if they stop now and offer me one, I could still even it out and get three in.
527960	529240	I just wanted one.
530120	531560	Thomas, you want to open one?
531560	533320	We didn't know, unfortunately.
533880	535800	I don't think it crossed either one of our minds.
535800	537240	That's my whole point, clearly.
541240	543880	But let me tell you, we did get some Oscar Mayer wieners.
544760	547960	We got some oven roasted turkey breasts.
548040	549000	All tiny, huh?
549000	549640	So tiny.
549640	550680	How small are we talking?
550680	552120	We're talking not big.
552920	554840	We're not even talking normal size.
555800	561000	If you took a product and you shrunk it down like Honey, I Shrunk Your Products, it's that.
561560	562920	Maybe it is all leading up to...
563560	565480	It's all promotion for a movie.
565480	566440	Everything's promotion.
566440	567880	God, it sounds so much fun to open one of those.
569800	570840	Actually, hold on.
570840	572200	Joe and I are upset, too.
573080	574200	That you didn't get oranges?
574200	574840	Yeah.
574840	575720	It's your wife.
576120	578920	We weren't even aware of the phone we were missing.
578920	579640	Bring it up.
579640	580520	Here's how it happened.
580520	582520	Which is worse if you think about it.
582520	583000	I left.
583800	586920	There's five people in this house right now, so that could have been two for everybody.
586920	588760	Yeah, that would have been an even number.
588760	594440	I emerged from the bathroom and I started looking through the tiny things and she said,
594440	595720	oh, look what I have.
595720	599560	And she went and got two packages of tiny things and said, do you want to open this with me?
599560	600600	Stop defending that woman.
600600	601000	I'm not.
601000	602280	I'm putting blame on her.
602280	604040	She was the one that went to get them.
604040	605480	She could have came in, knocked down here.
605480	607880	I think we're all in agreement that this is Taylor's fault.
607880	614040	Guys, do you want to stop recording and open up two slices of oranges each?
614040	618200	Can you imagine if we were in the middle of recording and she did come in?
618200	621000	Could have been an all-time great episode moment.
623880	626520	She took something from thousands of listeners, too.
626520	627080	Damn, dude.
630680	633240	That would have been our dragons are spooky of season two.
634840	637080	Oh, sorry for the season one call back.
637080	640840	Those of you who haven't made it back there, but if you are listening to this and you haven't
640840	642920	listened to season one, what are you doing?
642920	644760	Come on, check it out.
645320	650520	I will say highlight of my week so far, um, opening up five slices.
658520	663400	Oh man, let's dive into the deep sleepy slumber.
663400	666200	Let's get into this boring shit so I can go buy some more.
669880	674760	It is the morning of Thursday, July 7th.
676440	678040	Right now, can you put in the music?
678040	683320	That's like like the morning music, the morning music.
684360	689480	It's like birds are chirping on the show and they play that same song for every show ever.
690440	691400	Do you know what I'm talking about?
691400	691800	I do.
691800	693480	Is it like the Vivaldi?
693480	694920	Is it trying to remember what it was?
694920	699000	Cause I used to know it's, I think it's called like dawn, something morning, morning,
699000	700120	dawn or something like that.
700120	702760	It's a classical piece that ended up being used.
702760	704360	Oh, it's a classical piece.
704360	705720	Is it bittersweet symphony?
706520	707400	Yeah, that's it.
707400	707880	That's it.
717000	717480	No shit.
717480	718840	I think it's called morning wood.
719480	723000	No, that's what it.
728040	729640	That's what it feels like to have morning wood.
732520	734040	I know it's morning.
734040	736280	And a bird comes in and perches on it.
740040	742680	Horror podcast, horror podcast, horror podcast.
742680	744680	What if a woodpecker pecked your pecker?
744680	749640	But no one wakes up to a woodpecker pecking at their pecker.
750360	752600	Julius wakes up in his mind.
752600	755400	Morningwood is playing and then he's like, uh oh.
758840	761000	And Beck Wilder wakes up.
761000	764200	I think probably still covered in equipment.
764920	767160	Yeah, definitely.
767720	772280	His headphones have kind of slacked off on his head, kind of around his face and eyes.
773240	776520	And he's got his cameras resting on his chest.
777160	781080	And he looks disheveled like he'd had a fiffle night's sleep.
781080	784280	And Cal Colorado wakes up in his own bedroom.
784280	789000	No, he wakes up on the couch in his den and he's not spilled the glass of scotch,
789560	794600	but it is set like far closer to the edge of the table than he would normally countenance.
794600	801880	And he kind of snorts and the Bible is still open in his hand and he's
801960	804040	underlined, thou shalt not kill.
805240	808840	And he's thinking about that.
808840	811480	As he walks downstairs, probably a couple of hours before
812040	817560	either of your wake up scenes happens to start cooking everybody waffles and eggs.
817560	819960	Probably with a vegan option for Stevie.
819960	821320	Oh, that's very kind.
821320	825720	And this is how you know that we've got real role playing going on,
825720	830360	because I know that Thomas makes damn good pancakes.
830440	831480	So for you to go with waffles...
831480	832520	I'm a pancake man.
832520	833400	I'm a pancake man.
833400	834760	Cal is a waffle man.
835400	837720	And I stick to the character, folks.
837720	838840	Character choice.
838840	839340	That's right.
842040	846440	After I dropped off that weirdo, I went to fucking Waffle House and got the All-Star Special.
846440	846840	Oh, wow.
846840	847640	It was good.
847640	848520	Yeah, hell yeah.
848520	850280	The weirdo paid me to get waffles.
850280	850600	Nice.
850600	851000	Nice.
851000	852360	Some things even out.
852360	855400	Imagine if they served pancakes there though, you know?
855400	856760	They get so mad if you ask.
858680	860120	This is a waffle house!
861240	863080	Where are your manners?
865640	867000	That's the Grumpet Palace.
873480	873960	So yeah.
874600	879640	Beck follows his nose like a cartoon character floating out of the couch and into the kitchen.
879640	880760	Whoa, Cal.
880760	882440	You doing your famous waffles?
882440	883720	I mean, I almost said pancakes.
883720	885160	You're not a pancake guy.
885160	887960	Oh, I mean, I can make a mean cake when I have to, but...
888840	891320	No, Emeril taught me how to make these waffles.
891320	891880	Oh, bam!
898680	904600	Beck kind of takes a plate and sidles up next to the waffle maker, just like ready to be
904600	905800	served a hot one.
905800	907400	Hey, did you sleep okay?
907400	908600	I slept pretty fine.
908600	910360	You know, a good three and a half hours.
910360	911000	Pretty typical.
911000	912040	Pretty typical.
912040	913400	Three and a half, dude.
913400	914840	I don't know how you do it.
914840	916280	I think most people are like this.
916920	917800	Not me, man.
918520	923080	You know, I tend to find, you know, sure, people at work may grumble every now and then,
923080	927000	but you know, all of us kind of love when we just really get together and push through
927000	928280	working through the night and everything.
928840	930040	Don't you feel that way?
930040	930600	I mean, there is...
930600	932120	Don't you feel energized by that?
932120	936440	There's some camaraderie that I like there for sure, but no, I don't like it.
937320	944440	As this just then Julius comes like lunging into the room, like doing lunging.
946280	953000	Bec, Cal looks confused and a little hurt and he goes, Julius, would you like the first
953000	953400	waffle?
958120	959080	Oh, hell yeah.
960120	961480	Oh, I mean, I was okay.
961480	963160	Oh yeah, that'll be a couple minutes, Bec.
966760	968520	Julius gobbled it down.
968520	969240	He's hungry.
969240	972280	Does Cal Keurig or make a pot of coffee?
972280	978440	He's got an old shitty coffee maker from the nineties that he used like in his office that
978440	981800	he still like, it's his old reliable and there's a pot of that for sure.
982440	987640	And there's probably like three other very expensive devices for making any kind of
988520	991480	little espresso or Chemex pour over.
991480	991980	Yeah.
993640	995400	Aeropress tubes and shit.
996920	998440	He's got a Slayer in his kitchen.
999080	1000920	Shout out to all my coffee freaks out there.
1002440	1004200	Can I, can I grab an energy drink?
1005080	1008360	Last time I was here, you said you kept them stocked just in case we wanted one.
1010120	1011560	In case Beck wanted one.
1011560	1013160	If you, yeah.
1014120	1019160	Yeah, I mean, I mean, he opens it up and there's like 23 and he's like, yeah, there should
1019160	1019640	be enough.
1020680	1024680	I figured, you know, I was first waffle boy, so I felt like maybe I'd ask.
1025640	1028360	I was first waffle boy.
1028440	1035320	Beck is pouring himself a cup of coffee and he is grabbing a energy also and is cracking
1035320	1038360	it and he's double fisting his wake up juice.
1038360	1040520	Beck, will you give me, toss me one of those.
1040520	1042280	Julius, do you, do you like to work late?
1042280	1043320	Well, it depends.
1043320	1048280	Uh, you know, usually throughout my life, there's no like real hours on what I do.
1048280	1053560	So, uh, it's not really a question of whether I like doing it, but I do, I do it.
1053560	1053800	Okay.
1053800	1056920	But you've enjoyed your time at city action news, right?
1056920	1057960	Grinding for?
1058200	1058760	The truth?
1059320	1059640	Yeah.
1059640	1062120	I mean, for the week or so that I've been here, it's been great.
1062120	1063720	I wouldn't want to do it all the time though.
1063720	1065560	I don't think he kind of narrows his eyes.
1065560	1066200	Two weeks.
1066200	1069240	He narrows his eyes, but he doesn't yank the waffle from here.
1071640	1076360	I mean, if we're going to can is like everything we've been doing for the last two weeks.
1076360	1078520	Yeah, no, I would never want to stop it.
1078520	1079240	Okay.
1079240	1079560	Yeah.
1079560	1080120	Yeah.
1080120	1081160	It's important work.
1081160	1082200	Glad you feel that way.
1082200	1082920	Eat up.
1082920	1084120	You'll need the energy.
1084120	1084840	Yum, yum, yum.

1087800	1088200	Yeah.
1088200	1090120	Has anybody seen Stevie yet this morning?
1090120	1092520	Door was closed when you walked down the hallway.
1092520	1096360	Cow like walks straight down there and knocks too loud.
1096360	1098520	Not like mean, but just oblivious.
1099800	1100760	Hey, sweetie.
1100760	1102120	Uh, I mean, sorry, Stevie.
1104520	1105720	Breakfast is ready.
1105720	1107400	Um, so just come on out.
1108360	1109480	Rest of the cruise.
1109480	1109960	Yeah.
1109960	1113240	Hot, hot, fresh waffles, uh, vegan options.
1113240	1115480	I think I remember that you were maybe that.
1115480	1115880	Thank you.
1118200	1118440	Yeah.
1118440	1122600	You can hear them laughing, uh, as they wake up and come to.
1122600	1123480	Yeah, be there.
1123480	1124600	Be there in a minute.
1124600	1129480	Cow like stops and sniffs and he's like, Stevie, could you, you know, vape out the window?
1129480	1132680	I guess it's been a weird, all right.
1132680	1133320	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1133320	1133640	Sorry.
1133640	1134040	Sorry.
1134040	1134840	Thank you.
1134840	1140840	Uh, when you get back to the kitchen, uh, Beck's plate is like a swimming pool with
1140840	1142680	some waffle in it of syrup.
1142680	1143880	That's how you do it, dude.
1144680	1148680	Are you guys ready for, you know, D day?
1149720	1150520	Daddy day.
1150520	1151240	K day.
1151240	1151800	Kurt day.
1152840	1153720	Stop guys.
1153720	1154120	Come on.
1158120	1160840	Well, I guess, are you guys ready to go down the K hole?
1163800	1167080	Cal, Cal like winces, but he's like, I'll meet you halfway with that one.
1167800	1169240	We're going to go down the K hole.
1170440	1171480	He might even like that.
1171480	1173640	Maybe he can, maybe we can get him to stop the whole daddy.
1174280	1175960	Do you know that voice is not real, right?
1177160	1178520	That's not his real voice.
1178520	1184280	I had no reason to assume that he would have a fake voice, but he sounds twice as old as
1184280	1184760	he looks.
1186360	1187560	Have you heard his real voice?
1187560	1188360	What's it sound like?
1189400	1193400	It's just like a normal, normal kind of a little, you know, shyer.
1193400	1195320	I don't know that it's not his real voice.
1195320	1198040	I just assume you're right though.
1198040	1199960	It does seem like it's putting it on for sure.
1199960	1201880	He's definitely putting it on a little bit, right?
1202200	1202680	Yeah.
1202680	1206040	Stevie's behind you and they say shyer.
1206040	1207720	Like he sounds like a hobbit.
1210040	1210840	Have a waffle.
1211960	1213000	Good morning.
1213000	1213880	Good morning, Stevie.
1213880	1214600	Have a waffle.
1215240	1216440	Not a morning person.
1216440	1217640	Yeah, me too, dude.
1217640	1218120	Yeah.
1218120	1219640	Energy drink helps.
1219640	1221160	Oh, uh, thanks.
1221160	1222520	I'll do a coffee.
1222520	1224440	You know, as you get older, that'll, that'll change.
1224440	1226440	I used to sleep until seven or eight sometimes.
1227640	1228680	And I was your hitch.
1229480	1231800	I heard you guys, you guys talking.
1231800	1234360	What's the, what's the game plan?
1234360	1236040	There's a lot going on today.
1236040	1243480	Well, first off we got to, uh, we're meeting, uh, Kurt, Kurt at his K hole at the K hole.
1243480	1243720	Okay.
1243720	1244440	That's what you were.
1244440	1246440	So I guess we're going to go do that.
1246440	1251320	And then after that, what we could, we, we could go to the church at Godel.
1251320	1255080	We could go to, we could go to the prison to talk to Kaylee silver.
1255080	1257880	We could, those two sound like other good options.
1257880	1260280	And then we have that meeting at the foundry.
1260280	1262680	The underground jazz abode.
1262680	1264680	Well, and the foundry for lunch.
1264680	1265240	Right.
1265240	1265640	Oh yeah.
1265640	1267000	You guys were going to meet.
1267000	1267720	What was his name?
1267720	1269320	Rock Brock Hargrave.
1269320	1269880	Right.
1269880	1271000	There's a rock guy.
1271000	1271320	Yeah.
1271320	1273560	And everyone's looking at Cal.
1273560	1275320	Didn't you know like,
1275320	1276360	Oh yeah, yeah, hold on.
1276360	1280920	And he like, he disappears down the hallway and he comes back a second later and he's
1280920	1281720	like here.
1281720	1287240	And it's a big picture of him and dr Brock, uh, in like 1999 at a new year's Eve party
1287240	1288040	in the city.
1288040	1290920	And he has a shirt on that says new year's Brock and Eve.
1293080	1293800	Very good.
1295000	1295480	Yeah.
1295480	1304920	So standing next to a younger Cal Colorado, you see dr Brock Hargrave, who is a tall wiry
1304920	1309800	man with a short beard and his hands are stained with dirt.
1310360	1316760	Even at this party, uh, he's wearing a flannel shirt, cargo pants, rugged boots.
1317240	1324600	A well worn backpack and a faded gray brown cowboy hat sits top his head.
1325240	1329000	And you see that he is holding the top of a shovel.
1329560	1333080	And Cal, you remember him always having that shovel with him.
1333080	1335080	I remember he always had that shovel with him.
1335080	1335720	Is that?
1335720	1340840	And then the camera whip pans over to the shovel that's sitting in the corner of the
1340840	1343560	breakfast nook in Cal Colorado's home.
1343560	1348760	Cal's eyes dart from the photo in his hand to the, uh, the shovel sitting over in the
1348760	1351480	nook back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.
1351480	1354280	And it's like, son of a bitch, that's Brock shovel.
1355240	1356440	We can give it to him at lunch.
1358120	1364040	Do you think that maybe, maybe one of those pairs of legs was Brock?
1364040	1367560	It does seem weird that he would leave such a prized possession behind like that.
1367560	1378120	Uh, uh, uh, oh, no.
1379960	1381960	Well, but yes.
1389320	1392840	Joe Thomas, I need you to leave the room real quick.
1393000	1402200	I just wanted to check in and make sure that you remember Julius's interaction with Dr.
1402200	1403400	Brock Hargrave.
1403400	1404120	Oh shit.
1404120	1404360	No.
1407400	1411800	So in this moment, it was him with the water features.
1411800	1412520	Exactly.
1412520	1412920	Fuck.
1412920	1413720	Okay.
1413720	1416680	Was that before the haves happened?
1416680	1418600	That was yesterday before.
1418600	1419000	Yeah.
1419000	1419640	Wait.
1419640	1422760	That happened when I was delivering a package to him.
1422760	1423000	Right.
1423000	1423240	Yeah.
1423240	1424200	A couple of weeks ago.
1424200	1424840	Okay.
1424840	1425240	Yes.
1425240	1427160	I hadn't, I hadn't remembered that.
1427160	1428120	So cool.
1428120	1428760	Nice.
1428760	1430440	I will have a sudden realization.
1432440	1432760	Yeah.
1432760	1434520	Cause the picture sparked your memory.
1434520	1435480	Absolutely.
1435480	1437240	Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
1437240	1438040	Squaaaaa.
1440920	1443080	Mine, mine, mine, mine.
1444520	1445160	No movement.
1445720	1447880	Maybe they're listening to bird noises on their phone.
1449640	1453800	I could not hear your birdies.
1454440	1457400	They were just listening in through the door and they're like, okay, we got to give it
1457400	1463800	a minute to act like we too long.
1463800	1471480	And we're zoomed in on Cal Colorado's face as he processes one of many scenarios.
1471480	1472280	Hold on, Cal.
1472280	1474680	Can I, can I get a better look at that picture?
1475320	1476040	Yeah.
1476040	1481880	I I've met him before I met him like a couple of weeks ago.
1483800	1484440	Okay.
1484440	1492440	At his house, I, I delivered a package to him and he gave me a bag.
1492440	1495560	Was this for your, your X files?
1495560	1495880	Yeah.
1495880	1501320	I, well, the last time I was at the zeitgeist, I met with X and, and she gave me a package
1501320	1506040	to deliver to him and I, you know, I didn't ask any questions.
1506040	1510440	I just gave it to him and he gave me a bag and I, I looked at what was in the bag and
1510440	1518120	it was like a rubbing of, of like, I don't know, some like old language or like weird
1518120	1518440	symbols.
1518440	1522920	I couldn't really tell what it was and I didn't, you know, I didn't really mess with
1522920	1523320	it.
1523320	1525480	I just took that back to my house.
1526120	1529160	Was there like any information with it or was it like just that?
1529160	1530280	I didn't really look through.
1530280	1533160	I didn't want to like make it seem like I had looked through it.
1533160	1538280	I didn't open up the package that, that I gave him either, but maybe X knows something
1538280	1539000	about it.
1539000	1540600	I'm worried that Dr.
1540600	1543400	Brock's not going to make his lunch date with us.
1543400	1545000	That's kind of what I'm thinking too.
1545720	1547000	Seeming more and more likely.
1547640	1548760	Well, clean your plates.
1548760	1550280	There's starving children in contention.
1555080	1555720	Thanks, Mr.
1555720	1556440	Colorado.
1556440	1557320	You're welcome, Stevie.
1557320	1561000	Yeah, thanks.
1561000	1562280	Yeah, they look at everyone else.
1564120	1568200	Cal, these are the best you've ever done and that is saying something.
1568200	1568760	Thank you, Beck.
1569800	1573320	Working with you every day is like the best work I've ever done.
1574840	1575880	Thanks, man.
1575880	1576520	You too.
1576520	1577960	Let's go shoot some holes.
1577960	1580200	Let's go shoot that fucking kale.
1581080	1582200	Hands in.
1582200	1583400	Mighty ducks on three.
1583480	1587000	One, two, three.
1599640	1600840	Maybe next time.
1600840	1606280	City action news on N C A N.
1606280	1607800	City action news.
1608440	1608680	Cool.
1609400	1609960	Hell yeah.
1609960	1611560	I always wanted to do that.
1611560	1612760	Now you have shotgun.
1613960	1625720	We're here.
1626360	1628440	That was, yes, that was beautiful.
1628440	1635320	We saw the map from overhead with the fun sound effects and a little animated van.
1636840	1639880	Yeah, the Mercedes van.
1639880	1640360	Yeah.
1640360	1641160	Fuck yeah.
1641160	1643240	It does a little loop de loop on accident.
1644840	1652120	And we get to the bridge, which, um, has now been completely shut off from traffic.
1652120	1655720	There's a big pylons in the road.
1655720	1659160	The big, like heavy orange guys.
1659160	1661320	They do not need to construct more pylons here.
1664680	1665480	I don't get that.
1666600	1667320	I don't get that.
1672120	1674280	I felt that in my soul.
1675320	1676280	Julius Chuckles.
1677080	1677800	It's nothing.
1677800	1678920	No, it was a good one, Julius.
1678920	1679640	It was really good.
1679640	1680600	That was super funny.
1681560	1681880	What?
1681880	1682920	What's so funny?
1682920	1683320	Stevie.
1683320	1684200	What's funny?
1684200	1685400	He's just really fun.
1685400	1686200	Tell him, Stevie.
1686200	1686600	Tell him.
1686600	1686840	Yeah.
1686840	1687560	Describe it.
1687560	1688600	What does, what does that mean?
1689480	1693000	I mean, have you played Minecraft?
1693720	1694040	Yes.
1695000	1695480	Close.
1696680	1697320	Yeah, it is.
1698280	1702680	You got, you got subtract 20 years from that.
1703240	1705160	Well, subtract one word and add another.
1706920	1708520	Instead of down up.
1708520	1709880	Oh man.
1709880	1711080	I'm so confused.
1713480	1718040	Not down in a mine, but up amongst the clouds.
1720280	1721880	Cloudcraft would be dope.
1721880	1722520	That's cool.
1722520	1724200	Sounds like a cool game.
1724200	1725400	I've been playing tears of the kingdom.
1725400	1727000	It's that's okay.
1728280	1729280	Gotcha.
1729280	1730760	Up more up.
1730760	1731640	What?
1731640	1732840	Upper than the sky.
1732840	1733880	Above the sky.
1733880	1736040	Space craft.
1736040	1737560	Star craft.
1737560	1738440	There you go.
1738440	1739080	Oh yeah.
1739080	1739400	Okay.
1739400	1744920	So there's this game that a bunch of people played for like hours on end.
1746440	1747400	There's pot.
1747400	1748680	Julius gets out of the car.
1751320	1752920	Stevie, I think I see Kurt.
1752920	1754520	So why don't you tell me about it later?
1758120	1761560	I roll to know about star.
1765080	1766200	Oh God.
1766200	1773560	And Kurt is waiting for you all in an alleyway and he's on the bridge.
1773560	1773960	Oh no.
1773960	1776760	An alleyway, like near the bridge and he's locked up.
1776760	1778200	He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1778200	1779800	There's a bunch of blocks.
1779800	1783240	So you can only get like a block away from the bridge at this point.
1783240	1786200	And so you can see it from here, but there's no one.
1787160	1787800	Watching it.
1787800	1790600	We've got the credentials, even if they were so.
1790600	1791080	Yeah.
1791080	1792600	We're the news we're allowed to be anywhere.
1794520	1798440	Beck is putting on his lanyard that has his press pass in it.
1798440	1802840	As you lift the lanyard above your head, looking through the hole,
1802840	1809800	you see Kurt kind of waving you over like hurriedly and worriedly.
1809800	1811240	Hey guys, there's Kurt over there.
1811240	1812040	We go talk to him.
1812040	1812920	He's in his thirties.
1812920	1813800	He looks older.
1813800	1819800	His eyes are sunken in and he's wearing a disheveled can windbreaker.
1819800	1824840	He's got big curly hair atop his kind of tiny head.
1825560	1831720	Oh, he's got a old TC and polo on underneath the can windbreaker.
1831720	1836200	And as you notice that Cal, he kind of zips up the windbreaker and is like,
1837640	1840280	Hey, are you wearing, I've got the drone.
1841080	1842760	Are you wearing your can colors?
1843400	1845640	In addition to the city news colors.
1845640	1847800	No, no, it's not like that.
1847800	1850760	You cannot solely the can colors like that.
1850760	1851800	No, no.
1851800	1853400	At least you zipped up.
1853400	1854680	I didn't do it.
1854680	1855960	I just saw you.
1855960	1858760	And he just stares at you with these sunken in eyes.
1860120	1861160	Beck, were you filming that?
1861160	1861720	I got it.
1861720	1862040	Okay.
1862040	1862540	Yeah.
1863320	1863820	Fuck.
1864520	1865000	Drone.
1865000	1865720	Let's drone.
1865720	1866200	Let's do it.
1866200	1866680	Come on.
1866680	1867560	Okay.
1867560	1870280	He reaches down into a bowling bag.
1870280	1870760	Nice.
1870760	1871160	Cool.
1871480	1873160	Pulls out a drone.
1874360	1877000	It's like, let's do this.
1877000	1878120	Let's go.
1878120	1881720	How did I, it was, it was older.
1881720	1885480	It was like more like this and just a little sexual undertone.
1886760	1887960	Do you need to listen to it again?
1887960	1891800	No, please do.
1893960	1895160	I'm excited about this.
1895160	1898360	The last time we had a drone experience, it went well.
1898840	1905080	And the last time, the last time Zach listened to this guy's voice, it, uh, it got used.
1905080	1907720	So maybe this time a drone will hit him in the fucking throat.
1908440	1912120	I was doing the city news voice.
1914440	1916440	So you it's, so it's a, it's a voice.
1916440	1917320	You admit it's a voice.
1917320	1918360	I didn't do it.
1918360	1920920	Cal, Cal, you called it.
1920920	1922200	That's putting the cows.
1922200	1922520	Nope.
1922520	1923080	You got it.
1923080	1923640	I told you.
1923640	1926200	You didn't skip out from a mile away.
1926200	1927960	None of you know what's true.
1928040	1929880	Just talk, just talk normal.
1929880	1930680	All right.
1930680	1931000	All right.
1931000	1931320	All right.
1931320	1931720	All right.
1931720	1937880	And he is going to drone it up and succeeds.
1938440	1947160	And he flies the drone up and up and up along the buildings on either side of you in this
1947160	1953240	alleyway, old brick architecture with arches over the windows.
1953960	1956520	And then the drone flies out.
1957400	1964440	In the distance, you see the bridge, you see the city river flowing through wide and vast
1964440	1972920	and dark and strong, and you see the drone follow the path of the road over to the bridge.
1973800	1978440	And then it hovers above the gaping hole.
1979880	1980840	It's smooth.
1981160	1987640	You've seen it before, but through this lens from the top down, getting the full circumference
1987640	1997560	as the drone continues down, a light turns on the sun still kind of in the corner of
1997560	1998200	the sky.
1998200	2005400	Hasn't quite lit this far down inside the hole, but the light from the drone shines
2005800	2012440	shines bright below and illuminates crashing waves.
2014840	2016520	Uh, okay.
2016520	2018040	Kurt, can it, can it swim?
2019880	2020120	Yeah.
2021080	2022200	Go, go down there.
2022200	2022840	Oh, that's cool.
2023560	2024760	Descend on my dude.
2024760	2025400	Yeah.
2025400	2026360	Submerge.
2026360	2027480	Don't hit the tugboat.
2027480	2027960	Stop it.
2027960	2028920	I was doing it.
2030040	2030360	Okay.
2030360	2030760	Okay.
2030760	2031320	Okay.
2031320	2031560	Okay.
2035880	2038840	That goes to grab the controls and I get slapped back.
2040600	2042360	Julius kind of looks at Kalin back.
2042360	2044440	He's like, let daddy do his work.
2045000	2045800	Thank you.
2046520	2049640	Oh, I can relax my shoulders.
2051960	2060280	And it plunges and the drone is wet and the light kind of flashes, flickers, brushing
2060280	2066440	bubbles, and then you get deeper and the current kind of fades off.
2067480	2077000	And at the bottom of the city river, you see a tugboat that is like moving back and forth
2077000	2083320	just a little bit, almost like something on the other side is like doing exactly what
2083320	2087720	Thomas is doing with his hand, which is like wiggling it back and forth.
2088280	2089880	And it's just rocking.
2091000	2098120	You can only see half of it as the drone descends down one side and makes its way.
2098120	2103160	You see a very sharp circle along the ground.
2104840	2106360	It's tugboats stuck in a hole.
2107240	2113400	Can you like navigate the drone into the tugboat and then down past the hole and then out
2113400	2115480	a window of the tugboat beneath the hole?
2115480	2115640	Yeah.
2115640	2117160	Can you get further into the hole?
2117160	2120680	That is the coolest thing that you've ever said.
2120680	2121400	Wow.
2121400	2125640	My man, first you call me daddy, then you have a cool thought like that.
2125640	2129960	I mean, you boys could learn a thing or two from this young gentleman.
2129960	2133080	Julius is like fake smiling and nodding his head.
2133960	2136520	Yes, we all have a lot to learn from young Julius.
2136520	2139320	He's a shining bright star at Cannes.
2140600	2146600	His career and, you know, workplace behavior is something we might all strive to emulate,
2146600	2146840	Kurt.
2149880	2155080	Julius's smile gets more fake.
2158920	2159480	I'm sorry.
2159480	2165400	I didn't mean to, you know, I'm not talking about, you know, uh, the stuff, but you know
2165400	2165880	what, nevermind.
2165880	2168040	Just can you just send that drone down that fucking hole?
2168040	2172040	In Julius's mind, he thinks Cal is talking about the fact that he's not going to be the
2172040	2173480	like lead producer.
2173480	2174600	That's like what's.
2174600	2179400	Yeah, because you've, you've wrapped your uncle in a wall of thighs.
2179960	2180200	Yes.
2184200	2184520	Wow.
2186920	2194920	A beautiful, beautiful sentiment as the camera heads into the tugboat, as Zach watches a
2194920	2198840	tugboat tour on YouTube.
2198840	2199960	I can just come out the butt.
2201000	2203240	I think we all assumed it would come out the butthole.
2203240	2203740	Yeah.
2204440	2207000	This guy's really showing me a lot of knobs.
2207800	2208920	Not interested.
2208920	2209960	Yeah, it's all in the front.
2209960	2211080	It's knobs on the front.
2212200	2213800	Got the bottle on the back.
2213800	2214920	Aft as they say.
2215720	2218600	And the drone, you learn a lot from those videos.
2220440	2221720	Through the sea of knobs.
2222840	2224920	Delicately avoiding each.
2224920	2225800	There's so many.
2226040	2227000	Step here, boy.
2229800	2233400	That's what Kurt is saying to the camera that he's directing.
2235400	2241000	And looks up and is like, oh, I mean, I mean, oh yeah, the knobs get on through there.
2241000	2245400	My guy, I was like, no, I kind of thought the pirate thing was a little cool, better
2245400	2249240	than your usual stick, you know, sex monster or whatever.
2252120	2253000	Let him focus.
2253000	2254520	The drone continues.
2260520	2266920	Oh, the drone continues on down into the tugboat and then through the back.
2266920	2267640	Oh my God.
2267640	2268760	So many knobs.
2268760	2270360	And out the other side.
2271000	2272360	We're through the butt, gentlemen.
2274760	2277880	The screen that you're watching flickers.
2277880	2285000	And as it flickers, it's like the scene changes completely.
2287880	2289080	Who changed the channel?
2291080	2293160	This is a pretty important role.
2295160	2296120	What are we rolling?
2297160	2298600	One of you should do it.
2299320	2303480	No, you're going to roll a specific die for me.
2303480	2305080	And I'm going to tell you which one.
2305080	2308120	One momentarily.
2308120	2308920	Okay.
2308920	2313400	After I find a tugboat butthole chart.
2313400	2313720	Yeah.
2313720	2315240	I can't find the butthole.
2315240	2317720	It's the it's right under the poop deck.
2323160	2324280	I think I got it.
2325000	2325720	Six.
2325720	2327640	You can go ahead and roll a D six for me.
2327640	2328920	Everybody or one person.
2328920	2329880	Just one person.
2329880	2331240	Roll them skull boys, Joe.
2331240	2331740	Yeah.
2332360	2333480	I hope it's good.
2333480	2334360	I hope it's a six.
2335080	2338280	It's a three, which is either the middle right in the middle.
2338280	2339800	Oh my God.
2339800	2341000	Very cool.
2341000	2342840	You see three more tugboats.
2344600	2353960	The camera is no longer submerged in water and it is no longer being lit by the light
2353960	2361400	that is shining from off the drone because there is sunlight coming in from the windows
2361400	2365320	at the top of a gymnasium.
2367320	2370200	An old timey school gymnasium.
2371640	2379800	You see dust falling in the sun rays that make their way down onto the basketball court.
2381960	2388040	And on the far side, underneath one of the basketball hoops.
2388040	2396440	There's a throne and it's bloody.
2398840	2405400	Double doors open on the right side of this room, opposite from where the sun is coming
2405400	2416440	in and the light hits a young creature, small creature, humanoid, not quite human.
2416440	2420040	Ears are too high on its head, too round.
2420040	2427960	And it's wearing a school uniform suddenly is sprinting on all fours directly toward
2427960	2428520	the drone.
2429160	2436200	As it gets closer, you see blood on its face and hands and on the uniform itself.
2437320	2439480	And I am in a call for a roll.
2440520	2444360	One of you guys should roll for the drone operation here.
2444360	2444860	Okay.
2445660	2448540	Thomas, go ahead and roll for the drone operation.
2448540	2450940	Kurt is pretty good.
2450940	2452060	65.
2452060	2452780	Fuck yeah.
2452780	2453500	65.
2455340	2456300	43.
2456300	2457820	He nimbly fucking.
2457820	2459660	Oh, maybe it's 21.
2459660	2460620	Oh, hell yeah.
2460620	2461180	Yes.
2461180	2462220	Nimbly.
2462220	2466220	This thing is coming directly toward you.
2467260	2468940	Oh, yes.
2468940	2470700	I've got it.
2470700	2478140	And it goes straight up in the air and this thing launches itself off its hind legs to
2478140	2482460	try to grab onto the drone and just barely taps it.
2482460	2484940	And you get the little wiggle on the camera.
2485980	2491340	The camera is looking down at this thing as it sort of begins to circle and prowl and
2491340	2492460	looking up.
2492460	2495740	Just a quick aside, Zach, you know, you control this whole world.
2495740	2500460	Why wasn't the throne and the weird boy covered in, say, chocolate instead of blood?
2500700	2501200	True.
2502460	2503580	You have these choices.
2503580	2504300	That reminds me.
2504300	2504780	Roll grip.
2507580	2509980	Oh, not a good one for Cal Colorado.
2509980	2513900	It's a fail for me, Julius.
2513900	2515180	Beck fails also.
2515180	2516540	All righty.
2517180	2520140	Well, I think this is going to be a decently fat one, even though...
2520140	2523020	And fat grip chair.
2523020	2532460	So I think let's go with a D4 and another D4.
2532460	2533260	Oh, my.
2535260	2538140	A two and a four.
2538700	2541660	That's a three and a four.
2543340	2545740	A three and a four.
2547340	2550380	I lost seven and that puts me at my breaking point.
2550380	2553660	I also lost seven and that is a breaking point for Cal.
2553660	2557420	I lost six and it puts me one above my breaking point.
2557420	2558620	I'm close, but haven't broken.
2561420	2562300	Oh, my God.
2562300	2563820	You have 12 grip?
2563820	2564320	Yes.
2568300	2569980	Yeah, that actually makes a ton of sense.
2571820	2575020	And funny enough, my next breaking point is at zero.
2575020	2575520	I don't have...
2577100	2577740	Last one.
2578540	2579260	Last one.
2579260	2579580	All right.
2579660	2587900	Well, so let's get Joe and Luke to leave the room and we'll start with Thomas here.
2588940	2590220	Well, well, well.
2590220	2591660	Hey, Zach, that was really cool.
2591660	2593340	I like coming down into a gym.
2593340	2595580	That was not expected and very fucking cool.
2595580	2596080	Hey, thanks.
2596700	2597820	And I'm scared of the gym.
2598220	2611980	Hey, dude, what do you want to lose your shit about?
2612860	2613360	I don't know.
2613900	2616300	When I fail my grip, does that mean I know it's real?
2616300	2618380	Yeah, I think you do.
2618380	2619740	I think you know it's real.
2619740	2620240	Okay.
2620620	2622620	What's Cal's grip at currently?
2622620	2623260	35.
2623820	2624700	Gotten pretty low.
2624700	2625260	Yeah, that's...
2625260	2628380	His last fear was about big bodies of water.
2629260	2632620	So I think we can maybe even just like add on to that.
2632620	2638060	Where now it's like a fear of going down that hole or being sucked down.
2638940	2640940	A fear of being sucked down holes.
2641580	2642300	Yeah.
2642300	2647100	Yeah, and like absolutely not getting in water because you'll get sucked down a hole.
2647100	2647580	I don't know.
2647580	2651580	That seems simple, which isn't bad necessarily.
2652460	2654460	There are lots of holes in all sorts of stuff.
2655900	2657100	Yeah, I think it's the holes.
2657100	2658380	I think that's...
2658380	2661020	Anything that's a perfectly round hole, you're just like...
2661020	2662300	It's got to be pretty massive.
2662300	2665820	I don't think you're gonna be able to throw any old hole at him,
2665820	2669500	but unnaturally large and unnaturally smooth holes.
2669500	2671740	I mean, those are already terrifying, right?
2672300	2672940	Maybe for you.
2674620	2675900	I don't know what that means.
2678700	2680220	For me, that's a walk in the park.
2680220	2681180	Big holes.
2681180	2682060	Big holes?
2682060	2683340	Come on, that's Tuesday.
2686140	2691500	He could be afraid of the power of new media.
2693500	2694060	Drones.
2695020	2695980	Anti-drone.
2695980	2696860	Anti-drone.
2696860	2699820	It could be anti-Jim, anti-cat boy.
2700620	2701340	Certainly.
2701340	2703820	Again, probably just normal.
2705340	2709820	Yeah, I think going anti-new tech would be good.
2709820	2710320	Yeah.
2710700	2712620	He already doesn't understand a lot of technology.
2713580	2715500	Now he fears and hates it.
2715500	2718300	Oh, that sucks.
2718300	2720700	Now we're getting to the sad part of Cal-Colorado.
2720700	2721260	That's...
2721260	2723340	Yes, that's what I don't want to...
2723340	2724860	Well, that's the end.
2724860	2726620	I mean, this is where we're going.
2726620	2727900	He'll find a way out.
2728620	2729580	Man, he won't...
2729580	2731100	Maybe through his daughter.
2731100	2731820	Maybe.
2731820	2732860	That'd be cool.
2732860	2734780	The strength of love, Zach.
2734780	2735100	Man...
2735900	2740540	Do you have the courage to DM a Delta Green game where love conquers all?
2742700	2744220	Or are you a pussy?
2744220	2746060	Or are you a fucking little bitch?
2750460	2751500	All right, so yeah.
2751500	2752540	That sounds good.
2752540	2755260	He's gonna really want to do things the old way.
2755260	2755740	Okay.
2755740	2756380	He's gonna...
2756380	2757580	That's perfect for this.
2757580	2759340	I mean, where we're going, that's...
2759340	2759840	Boom.
2760620	2761980	Send in a boy.
2761980	2764140	Preferably, I think, Luke.
2764140	2765420	Because Joe doesn't have...
2765420	2765900	Oh, wait.
2765900	2766860	No, sit down.
2766860	2767260	Sit down.
2767260	2767820	Sit back down.
2768860	2771740	Fight, flight, or freeze.
2773500	2776700	Fight, freeze, flight.
2777260	2777740	Okay.
2777740	2778780	And that's a D6?
2778780	2779260	Yes, sir.
2780780	2781980	Five, so fight.
2781980	2783420	He punches Kurt in the face.
2787340	2787820	Thank you.
2790460	2792940	Get that drone fucking bullshit out of here.
2794460	2796140	We don't need to see this shit, Kurt.
2802700	2803580	I'm in trouble.
2807260	2809260	I hope you've been thinking about what you've done.
2810220	2811100	I'm in danger.
2812700	2814220	Well, you lost...
2814220	2814860	Seven.
2814860	2816220	And that took you to...
2816220	2817100	Twelve.
2817100	2817980	Which is a...
2817980	2818940	Breaking point.
2818940	2819440	So...
2824060	2825180	Yeah, let's start with...
2825180	2827020	You know, I just thought of it.
2827020	2828860	It's life-ruining and it's perfect.
2828860	2829580	Oh, great.
2829580	2831580	Julius is afraid of working out.
2831580	2832620	He's afraid of the gym.
2832620	2833660	Oh, no.
2833660	2835900	That's so sad, dude.
2835900	2838860	He's close to being just completely lost.
2838860	2840060	Yeah, you're right.
2840060	2840780	This is the end.
2840780	2841660	Do you think that's a good one?
2841660	2843420	Yeah, it's perfect because it's your last one.
2843420	2844620	Yeah, it's absolutely perfect.
2844620	2845340	It sucks.
2845340	2845980	It's perfect.
2845980	2849260	It's absolutely character-ruining, which is brutal and sad.
2849260	2849980	I love it.
2849980	2852460	Yes, that's so funny that you say that.
2853420	2853920	I love you.
2857180	2859340	Let's go ahead and fight.
2859340	2860380	Record it for real.
2860380	2863180	Fight, flight, or fight, fight, or freeze.
2863180	2864460	Fight, flight, or freeze.
2865340	2866620	What am I doing?
2866620	2869980	You are about to roll a d4 and two d10s.
2870780	2871660	Really good stuff.
2872540	2873100	D6, right?
2873100	2876460	We're pulling a long one here at PTBP tonight.
2876460	2877580	It's not that bad.
2877580	2877900	It's not.
2879020	2880300	You didn't put them in order.
2880300	2881100	Okay, I'll reroll.
2883020	2883500	Let's see.
2883500	2884460	In the situation...
2885100	2887180	Because I'm not in the situation.
2887180	2888220	I'm observing it.
2888860	2893740	Most likely would be freeze, and then flight, and then fight.
2893740	2894620	Okay, sounds good.
2895340	2896140	Roll a d6.
2897500	2898220	One.
2898220	2898620	Okay.
2898620	2899340	So fight.
2899340	2899660	Fight.
2900460	2900860	Damn.
2900860	2901660	Who do you attack?
2902460	2902860	Daddy.
2905500	2907420	Yep, what do you say as you attack him?
2907420	2913500	Yeah, so Julius is watching this all happen, and he kind of jumps when the thing jumps at the drone.
2913500	2917100	And then that physical reaction makes him think,
2917100	2918780	what the fuck am I looking at?
2918780	2919420	This is real.
2920460	2923340	And he doesn't want to see it anymore, so he's gonna just try to
2923900	2929020	probably violently knock the controller out of Kurt's hand.
2931580	2932860	That's fucking funny, man.
2934140	2934860	Thank you.
2934860	2937660	Yeah, it's all about, you know, making it fun.
2939900	2941180	Is it good for the story?
2941580	2942080	Kaka!
2943420	2948700	Probably hinders what we're able to do, but hey, it's what Julius would do.
2948700	2949580	It's the moment.
2949580	2950700	It's what happens.
2950700	2952460	This is classic what happens.
2952460	2958140	Yeah, and then definitely he doesn't want to work out anymore.
2961020	2962300	He's gonna be a sad sack.
2963420	2964220	A sad sack?
2966540	2967740	Welcome on back.
2967740	2968380	Welcome on back.
2968380	2970220	Oh yeah, you didn't hit yours.
2970220	2970540	Gotcha.
2973660	2978380	Joe, you lost more than five grip.
2979180	2983660	So I would need you to rank fight, flight, and freeze.
2983660	2985100	Freeze is his most likely.
2986060	2987980	Flee is his second likely.
2987980	2990220	And fight is least likely.
2990220	2991500	Absolutely.
2991500	2993420	Runaways two or three.
2993420	2994700	What's the good one?
2994700	2995580	Four, five, or six.
2996940	2997260	Six.
2997260	2998300	It's a sixer.
2998300	3003900	All right, so you get to freeze while the other two please roll.
3006300	3007340	Unarmed combat.
3010860	3011580	I gotta fail.
3012140	3013020	I gotta fail.
3013020	3015180	Cal passes, so what he said earlier happens.
3016460	3017580	Punches Kurt in the face.
3018700	3026380	Which literally knocks him so far out of the way that when Julius goes to knock the drone
3026380	3031580	out of his hands, you've already taken him way down.
3031580	3032620	Like he was hunched.
3033180	3035100	He was like sitting on his feet kind of.
3035100	3037500	Oh yeah, this is a sucker punch.
3038140	3038780	Complete.
3039900	3040620	Super rude.
3041900	3043020	Top notch rude.
3043020	3044860	If you could roll a D4.
3045500	3046460	It's so funny.
3047100	3047600	Four?
3049020	3049820	Oh my god.
3050540	3057580	It's so funny that Kurt is just like controlling the drone and is now getting pummeled.
3059980	3063020	He did so little of anything.
3065340	3067820	We saw something so scary we had to punch you.
3073820	3074940	Oh my god.
3074940	3079420	And so Stevie's screaming like, what are you doing?
3079500	3080300	What was that?
3080300	3080940	What are you doing?
3080940	3081740	It's these fucking drones.
3081740	3083900	They're gonna take all our fucking jobs.
3083900	3085420	And nobody needs to see that shit.
3092140	3093260	Technology, technology.
3093260	3095580	Beck, you and I just used to go out with our fucking cameras.
3095580	3096080	Hold on.
3099420	3100540	It would just be you and me.
3102460	3104220	That's all we needed to break a story, right?
3105020	3110940	Beck is staring down into the screen and making maybe some back of the throat noises.
3112380	3114700	Turn that fucking camera off.
3114700	3120140	As you scream that you're looking at this screen and the drone went all herky jerky
3120140	3123340	when your boy daddy got knocked to the ground.
3123340	3130860	And so the last thing this camera sees before you're turning it off is this creature
3131820	3132940	which you see now.
3133500	3139660	It's a person but its eyes are like too high on its face and kind of
3139660	3144140	a little bit further out and its ears are on the top of its head.
3144140	3145660	It's a fucking koala bear.
3146780	3148940	And its nose is like dark.
3151100	3155020	Cal kicks that like screen like the monitor into the river.
3155020	3160620	It's looking curiously into the camera and like that image twitches on the screen.
3161100	3164860	You all see as it flies slow-mo through the air.
3166060	3167660	A block away into the river.
3167660	3169980	Yeah, he's an ex-football star.
3170860	3172140	Or the trash or whatever the fuck.
3172700	3174140	Oh yeah, directly in the trash.
3174140	3174700	Whatever.
3174700	3177340	That's a big pile of garbage on the city streets.
3178140	3179900	Beck's eyes don't follow it.
3179900	3183740	They remain staring now at the ground where that screen used to be.
3183740	3186060	Cal kind of composes himself.
3186060	3189420	He shudders and like his whole body shakes.
3189500	3189980	And he says,
3190700	3191200	Kurt,
3192700	3193200	Daddy,
3194380	3195420	I'm really sorry.
3196060	3197500	Don't tell anybody about this.
3200620	3203660	Why, why did you do, why did you do that, man?
3204540	3208300	Why, why would you do that, man?
3210380	3213260	You're a creepy asshole but that didn't justify what I did to you.
3213980	3216220	My friend, Dr. Brock Hargrave.
3217420	3217740	Yeah?
3217740	3218540	Yeah, it was good.
3218540	3219040	Okay.
3221100	3223260	My friend, Dr. Bark, Brock Hargrave.
3226540	3235180	My friend, Dr. Bark Hargrave is missing his shovel and possibly both limbs if he's even alive.
3235820	3238220	I'm going to go to the foundry and have a fucking drink.
3239020	3242860	You guys are walking back to the van and Beck is still staring down at the ground.
3243580	3244080	Beck.
3244940	3245440	Come on.
3247020	3247740	Oh yeah.
3247740	3249180	And he jumps along behind him.
3249180	3250380	And Julius looks at him.
3250940	3252540	Did you get that on camera?
3253740	3254300	Oh shit.
3267020	3271340	Cal like throws $200 from his wallet down on top of Kurt.
3272220	3274700	It says, get a new one, drone boy.
3277740	3283580	He can cut that and play it at the end or whatever.
3287980	3290220	No, I'm doing like six endings on that.
3292460	3296620	Julius is like, damn, does an underwater drone only cost $200?
3299420	3300940	Cal sniffs the bag.
3307740	3318940	Four.
3324460	3328940	Cause my life is great.
