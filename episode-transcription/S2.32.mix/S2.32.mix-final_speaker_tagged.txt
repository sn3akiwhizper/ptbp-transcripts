0.00 319.48 speaker0  Slip in some slop, y'all. It's Wolf the Dog, the DJ Supreme from the radio station formerly and currently known as 694.2 PTBP. And I am here to give your ears a little butterfly kiss, but with my vocal cords. And speaking of things that are right, this Howlin' with Wolf is from Harley in Southampton, England, who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod, a worthwhile thing you can do, too, regardless of if you have a cool name and or are from a cool port city. You can still share the new promo video and tag at Pretending Pod. Harley from Southampton, England writes, And scrubbing Luz seems a bit less daunting while I have Keith Beans being an absolute mess in my headphones. Sometimes I do get strange looks when I start laughing out loud in the middle of a shift, but it's a small price to pay. Keep it up, guys. You make a lot of people really happy. And Wolf, keep on howlin'. I look forward to your dulcet tones at the start of every episode. Oh, and a look out for my upcoming post-apocalyptic gamebook, I guess, with Savage Realms gamebooks? Love, Harley from Southampton, England, xxx. Now, Harley, did you give ol' Wolfy an owoo? Owooooo! My lord, do I love a good howl with me, Wolf. Thanks for the kind words, especially the ones that are about yours truly. If you want to write up something for your slippy, sloppy wolf to howl, just tag at Pretending Pod on Twitter or Instagram, tag Pretending To Be People on Facebook, and tag user slash Pretending To Be People on Reddit. because Pretending To Be People collabed with a wildly talented film production team called Mood Ring Films. And together, they created a promo video that turned out well beyond the PTBP crew's most auspicious dreams. So just, uh, share that, and tag at Pretending Pod, and you're good to go. You can, uh, you can do that now. Go on, I'll wait. Oh, you need the link. That's what you're telling me. Well, guess where the link is. That's right, the links are in the show notes. Pretty cool news about that promo video, huh? And that weren't even the news. And he determined that it smelled like some moron's earwax, After another round of sniffs, Beck witnessed even more unnatural activity. Julius saw a blood moat above train tracks in the upside-down church in Grover's Gorge. And Cal smelled earwax again. Being handed a note by my producer, which is frankly horrible. Terrible smell, cold hand. Five stars. The note says that Thomas just released the finale of his Oops All Pettymores campaign over on the Patreon. That's right, all six parts of The Lost Treasure of John Lee Pettymore, including the two-part finale, part six, part one, and part six, part two, are now available in edited audio format at patreon.com slash pretending pod. And these were edited by the Thomas himself. you can get access for five bucks, five US dollars. And you can watch the very strange, sometimes partially cosplayed, VOD BTS streams of the Patreon recording process for fifteen dollars.
312.84 349.08 speaker1  But this is like hours upon hours of nasty streams from these dudes at their weirdest. Anyway, check it on out. It's a solid little horrible story. You're gonna say it in your head in this moment of silence.
344.20 434.44 speaker0  or the lightning tornado, or the blood moat in the upside down church, in the ongoing fan art contest slash drawing, you have until July 14th to enter. to even embroidery. or a recreation of the sitting while walking dance from the calzone.
433.80 479.48 speaker2  Good energy. What else we got? That was fun. Wait, what? There was an orange. Your wife said open this orange and I opened it and there's tiny products inside. any of the five slices, even though there's ten total between the two of us. Had Thomas not been staring at a puzzle and said like,
478.20 484.84 speaker0  Oh, can I open one?
484.12 517.72 speaker2  That's... Oh, wow. I shouldn't have to assume what you want to do. No, you should. At all times. I was like, I could be offered an orange. I wasn't actually mad, but I thought it was fun to do. Ten little orange slices. And then looking at the ceiling.
516.44 531.56 speaker3  Oh, yeah. Almond breeze, huh? What if I open one? Maybe it would be cool. I guess if they stop now and offer me one, I could still even it out and get three in.
530.12 543.88 speaker2  Thomas, you want to open one? That's my whole point, clearly.
541.24 562.92 speaker3  But let me tell you, we did get some Oscar Mayer wieners. We got some oven roasted turkey breasts. All tiny, huh? So tiny. How small are we talking? We're talking not big. We're not even talking normal size.
561.56 565.48 speaker2  Maybe it is all leading up to...
563.56 574.20 speaker3  It's all promotion for a movie. Everything's promotion.
573.08 583.00 speaker2  That you didn't get oranges? Yeah.
582.52 586.92 speaker3  I left.
583.80 595.72 speaker2  There's five people in this house right now, so that could have been two for everybody.
594.44 601.00 speaker3  oh, look what I have. And she went and got two packages of tiny things and said, do you want to open this with me? Stop defending that woman.
600.60 602.28 speaker2  I'm not.
601.00 618.20 speaker3  I'm putting blame on her. She was the one that went to get them. She could have came in, knocked down here.
614.04 644.76 speaker2  Can you imagine if we were in the middle of recording and she did come in? Could have been an all-time great episode moment. Oh, sorry for the season one call back. Those of you who haven't made it back there, but if you are listening to this and you haven't
642.92 694.92 speaker3  Come on, check it out. It's like birds are chirping on the show and they play that same song for every show ever. Do you know what I'm talking about? I do. Is it like the Vivaldi?
693.48 707.88 speaker2  Is it trying to remember what it was? Cause I used to know it's, I think it's called like dawn, something morning, morning, dawn or something like that. It's a classical piece that ended up being used. Oh, it's a classical piece. Is it bittersweet symphony?
707.40 736.28 speaker3  That's it. I think it's called morning wood.
734.04 755.40 speaker2  And a bird comes in and perches on it.
752.60 764.20 speaker3  Morningwood is playing and then he's like, uh oh.
761.00 821.32 speaker2  I think probably still covered in equipment. And he's got his cameras resting on his chest. And he looks disheveled like he'd had a fiffle night's sleep. And Cal Colorado wakes up in his own bedroom. but it is set like far closer to the edge of the table than he would normally countenance. And he kind of snorts and the Bible is still open in his hand and he's underlined, thou shalt not kill. As he walks downstairs, probably a couple of hours before Probably with a vegan option for Stevie.
819.96 831.48 speaker3  Oh, that's very kind.
830.44 852.36 speaker2  So for you to go with waffles... I'm a pancake man. I'm a pancake man. Character choice. That's right. Oh, wow. It was good. Yeah, hell yeah. The weirdo paid me to get waffles. Nice. Nice.
851.00 860.12 speaker3  Some things even out. They get so mad if you ask.
858.68 863.08 speaker2  This is a waffle house!
861.24 867.00 speaker1  Where are your manners?
865.64 885.16 speaker2  That's the Grumpet Palace. So yeah.
883.72 891.32 speaker0  You're not a pancake guy.
888.84 959.08 speaker2  No, Emeril taught me how to make these waffles. Hey, did you sleep okay? I slept pretty fine. Pretty typical. Pretty typical. working through the night and everything. Don't you feel that way? I mean, there is... waffle?
958.12 978.44 speaker3  Oh, hell yeah. He's hungry.
972.28 1004.20 speaker2  He's got an old shitty coffee maker from the nineties that he used like in his office that he still like, it's his old reliable and there's a pot of that for sure. And there's probably like three other very expensive devices for making any kind of little espresso or Chemex pour over. Yeah. Aeropress tubes and shit. He's got a Slayer in his kitchen. Shout out to all my coffee freaks out there.
1002.44 1013.16 speaker3  Can I, can I grab an energy drink?
1011.56 1024.68 speaker2  If you, yeah. be enough.
1020.68 1038.36 speaker3  I figured, you know, I was first waffle boy, so I felt like maybe I'd ask.
1035.32 1043.32 speaker2  it and he's double fisting his wake up juice.
1042.28 1057.96 speaker3  Well, it depends. So, uh, it's not really a question of whether I like doing it, but I do, I do it. Okay.
1056.92 1062.12 speaker2  Grinding for? The truth? Yeah.
1059.64 1069.24 speaker3  I mean, for the week or so that I've been here, it's been great. I wouldn't want to do it all the time though. I don't think he kind of narrows his eyes. Two weeks.
1066.20 1078.52 speaker2  He narrows his eyes, but he doesn't yank the waffle from here.
1076.36 1079.56 speaker3  Yeah, no, I would never want to stop it. Okay.
1079.24 1080.12 speaker2  Yeah.
1079.56 1082.92 speaker3  Yeah.
1082.20 1102.12 speaker2  Eat up. You'll need the energy. Yum, yum, yum. Beck, I've got a hot, fresh one right here for you. Yeah. Door was closed when you walked down the hallway. Cow like walks straight down there and knocks too loud. Not like mean, but just oblivious.
1100.76 1105.72 speaker3  Uh, I mean, sorry, Stevie.
1104.52 1124.60 speaker2  Breakfast is ready. Um, so just come on out. Rest of the cruise. Yeah. Hot, hot, fresh waffles, uh, vegan options. I think I remember that you were maybe that. Thank you. Yeah. You can hear them laughing, uh, as they wake up and come to.
1123.48 1133.32 speaker3  Be there in a minute.
1132.68 1150.52 speaker2  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Sorry. Thank you. Uh, when you get back to the kitchen, uh, Beck's plate is like a swimming pool with some waffle in it of syrup. That's how you do it, dude.
1149.72 1169.24 speaker3  Daddy day. K day. Kurt day. Come on.
1167.80 1184.76 speaker2  We're going to go down the K hole. He might even like that. Maybe he can, maybe we can get him to stop the whole daddy. Do you know that voice is not real, right? That's not his real voice.
1184.28 1193.40 speaker3  he looks. Have you heard his real voice?
1189.40 1199.96 speaker2  It's just like a normal, normal kind of a little, you know, shyer. I don't know that it's not his real voice.
1198.04 1202.68 speaker3  It does seem like it's putting it on for sure.
1202.20 1206.04 speaker2  Yeah.
1202.68 1214.60 speaker3  Stevie's behind you and they say shyer. Like he sounds like a hobbit.
1213.88 1217.64 speaker2  Have a waffle.
1216.44 1226.44 speaker3  Yeah, me too, dude. Yeah. Energy drink helps. Oh, uh, thanks. I'll do a coffee.
1224.44 1243.72 speaker2  I used to sleep until seven or eight sometimes. And I was your hitch. I heard you guys, you guys talking. What's the, what's the game plan?
1243.48 1265.24 speaker3  Okay. And then after that, what we could, we, we could go to the church at Godel. We could go to, we could go to the prison to talk to Kaylee silver. We could, those two sound like other good options. And then we have that meeting at the foundry. The underground jazz abode.
1264.68 1271.32 speaker2  Right. Oh yeah. Right.
1271.00 1280.92 speaker3  Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, hold on.
1276.36 1293.80 speaker2  And he like, he disappears down the hallway and he comes back a second later and he's like here. And it's a big picture of him and dr Brock, uh, in like 1999 at a new year's Eve party
1293.08 1304.92 speaker3  Very good. Yeah.
1295.48 1404.36 speaker2  So standing next to a younger Cal Colorado, you see dr Brock Hargrave, who is a tall wiry man with a short beard and his hands are stained with dirt. Even at this party, uh, he's wearing a flannel shirt, cargo pants, rugged boots. A well worn backpack and a faded gray brown cowboy hat sits top his head. And you see that he is holding the top of a shovel. And Cal, you remember him always having that shovel with him. Is that? And then the camera whip pans over to the shovel that's sitting in the corner of the breakfast nook in Cal Colorado's home. nook back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. We can give it to him at lunch. Brock Hargrave.
1404.12 1419.00 speaker3  No. Exactly. Fuck. Okay.
1418.60 1422.76 speaker2  Yeah.
1419.64 1425.24 speaker3  That happened when I was delivering a package to him. Right. Yeah. Okay.
1424.84 1437.24 speaker2  Yes. Absolutely.
1435.48 1495.88 speaker3  Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp. They were just listening in through the door and they're like, okay, we got to give it Can I, can I get a better look at that picture? Okay.
1495.56 1506.04 speaker2  Yeah.
1501.32 1539.00 speaker3  to deliver to him and I, you know, I didn't ask any questions. I just gave it to him and he gave me a bag and I, I looked at what was in the bag and it was like a rubbing of, of like, I don't know, some like old language or like weird symbols. I couldn't really tell what it was and I didn't, you know, I didn't really mess with it. I just took that back to my house. I didn't want to like make it seem like I had looked through it.
1538.28 1545.00 speaker2  about it. I'm worried that Dr. Brock's not going to make his lunch date with us.
1543.40 1561.00 speaker3  That's kind of what I'm thinking too. Thanks, Mr. Colorado.
1557.32 1568.76 speaker2  Yeah, thanks. Yeah, they look at everyone else.
1568.20 1576.52 speaker1  Thank you, Beck.
1575.88 1583.40 speaker3  You too. Let's go shoot some holes.
1582.20 1607.80 speaker2  Mighty ducks on three. City action news on N C A N.
1606.28 1635.32 speaker1  City action news. Cool.
1628.44 1640.36 speaker2  We saw the map from overhead with the fun sound effects and a little animated van.
1639.88 1655.72 speaker3  Yeah. Fuck yeah.
1652.12 1677.80 speaker2  There's a big pylons in the road. The big, like heavy orange guys. I don't get that.
1677.08 1679.64 speaker3  It's nothing.
1678.92 1681.88 speaker2  It was really good. That was super funny.
1681.56 1683.32 speaker3  What?
1682.92 1711.08 speaker2  Stevie. What's funny? He's just really fun. Tell him, Stevie. Tell him. Yeah. Describe it. I mean, have you played Minecraft? Close. Yeah, it is. Well, subtract one word and add another.
1709.88 1722.52 speaker1  I'm so confused.
1721.88 1729.28 speaker2  That's cool. Sounds like a cool game. I've been playing tears of the kingdom. It's that's okay.
1728.28 1732.84 speaker1  Gotcha.
1731.64 1739.40 speaker2  Upper than the sky. Above the sky. Space craft. Star craft.
1739.08 1747.40 speaker1  Okay.
1746.44 1773.56 speaker2  There's pot. So why don't you tell me about it later? Oh God.
1766.20 1773.96 speaker3  And Kurt is waiting for you all in an alleyway and he's on the bridge.
1773.56 1790.60 speaker2  Oh no. An alleyway, like near the bridge and he's locked up. He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a bunch of blocks. So you can only get like a block away from the bridge at this point. And so you can see it from here, but there's no one. Watching it.
1787.80 1813.80 speaker3  We've got the credentials, even if they were so. We go talk to him.
1812.92 1887.96 speaker2  He looks older. His eyes are sunken in and he's wearing a disheveled can windbreaker. Oh, he's got a old TC and polo on underneath the can windbreaker. And as you notice that Cal, he kind of zips up the windbreaker and is like, Are you wearing your can colors? In addition to the city news colors. I didn't do it. I just saw you. And he just stares at you with these sunken in eyes. Beck, were you filming that? I got it. Okay. Yeah. Fuck. Drone. Let's do it. Come on. Okay. He reaches down into a bowling bag. Nice. Cool. Pulls out a drone.
1886.76 1905.08 speaker3  Do you need to listen to it again? The last time we had a drone experience, it went well.
1898.84 1920.92 speaker2  And the last time, the last time Zach listened to this guy's voice, it, uh, it got used. So maybe this time a drone will hit him in the fucking throat. So you it's, so it's a, it's a voice. You admit it's a voice. I didn't do it.
1918.36 1922.20 speaker1  Cal, Cal, you called it.
1920.92 1931.00 speaker2  That's putting the cows. Nope. You got it. I told you. You didn't skip out from a mile away.
1930.68 1931.72 speaker1  All right. All right.
1931.32 2020.12 speaker2  All right. And he is going to drone it up and succeeds. alleyway, old brick architecture with arches over the windows. And then the drone flies out. And then it hovers above the gaping hole. It's smooth. You've seen it before, but through this lens from the top down, getting the full circumference as the drone continues down, a light turns on the sun still kind of in the corner of the sky. Hasn't quite lit this far down inside the hole, but the light from the drone shines shines bright below and illuminates crashing waves.
2019.88 2030.36 speaker3  Yeah. Go, go down there. Yeah. Stop it. I was doing it.
2030.04 2031.32 speaker1  Okay. Okay.
2030.76 2031.56 speaker3  Okay.
2031.32 2044.44 speaker2  Okay.
2042.36 2077.00 speaker3  He's like, let daddy do his work.
2067.48 2115.48 speaker2  And at the bottom of the city river, you see a tugboat that is like moving back and forth Thomas is doing with his hand, which is like wiggling it back and forth. And it's just rocking. You can only see half of it as the drone descends down one side and makes its way. You see a very sharp circle along the ground. It's tugboats stuck in a hole.
2113.40 2121.40 speaker3  a window of the tugboat beneath the hole? Yeah. Can you get further into the hole?
2120.68 2139.32 speaker1  Wow. My man, first you call me daddy, then you have a cool thought like that. I mean, you boys could learn a thing or two from this young gentleman.
2136.52 2159.48 speaker2  He's a shining bright star at Cannes. His career and, you know, workplace behavior is something we might all strive to emulate, Kurt.
2158.92 2165.88 speaker3  I'm sorry.
2165.40 2173.48 speaker2  what, nevermind.
2172.04 2184.52 speaker3  like lead producer. That's like what's. Yes.
2184.20 2199.96 speaker1  Wow.
2198.84 2225.80 speaker2  I can just come out the butt. I think we all assumed it would come out the butthole. Yeah. Got the bottle on the back.
2224.92 2241.00 speaker3  There's so many. Step here, boy.
2235.40 2270.36 speaker1  And looks up and is like, oh, I mean, I mean, oh yeah, the knobs get on through there.
2268.76 2313.72 speaker2  And out the other side. We're through the butt, gentlemen. The screen that you're watching flickers. And as it flickers, it's like the scene changes completely. One of you should do it. No, you're going to roll a specific die for me. And I'm going to tell you which one. One momentarily.
2313.40 2329.88 speaker1  Yeah.
2328.92 2331.24 speaker3  Just one person.
2329.88 2333.48 speaker2  Roll them skull boys, Joe.
2332.36 2342.84 speaker3  I hope it's good. I hope it's a six.
2341.00 2452.78 speaker2  You see three more tugboats. that is shining from off the drone because there is sunlight coming in from the windows at the top of a gymnasium. An old timey school gymnasium. You see dust falling in the sun rays that make their way down onto the basketball court. And on the far side, underneath one of the basketball hoops. There's a throne and it's bloody. Double doors open on the right side of this room, opposite from where the sun is coming in and the light hits a young creature, small creature, humanoid, not quite human. And it's wearing a school uniform suddenly is sprinting on all fours directly toward the drone. As it gets closer, you see blood on its face and hands and on the uniform itself. And I am in a call for a roll. One of you guys should roll for the drone operation here. Okay. Thomas, go ahead and roll for the drone operation. Kurt is pretty good.
2452.06 2453.50 speaker1  Fuck yeah.
2452.78 2460.62 speaker2  65. 43. He nimbly fucking.
2459.66 2461.18 speaker3  Oh, hell yeah.
2460.62 2468.94 speaker2  Yes. Nimbly.
2467.26 2482.46 speaker1  Oh, yes.
2478.14 2558.62 speaker2  try to grab onto the drone and just barely taps it. The camera is looking down at this thing as it sort of begins to circle and prowl and looking up. True. You have these choices. That reminds me. Roll grip. Beck fails also. All righty. Well, I think this is going to be a decently fat one, even though... Oh, my.
2557.42 2563.82 speaker1  I'm close, but haven't broken.
2562.30 2575.52 speaker2  You have 12 grip? Yes.
2575.02 2623.26 speaker3  I don't have... Last one. All right. When I fail my grip, does that mean I know it's real?
2622.62 2681.18 speaker2  35. Gotten pretty low. Yeah, that's... His last fear was about big bodies of water. So I think we can maybe even just like add on to that. Where now it's like a fear of going down that hole or being sucked down. A fear of being sucked down holes. There are lots of holes in all sorts of stuff. but unnaturally large and unnaturally smooth holes. Maybe for you. I don't know what that means. For me, that's a walk in the park.
2680.22 2694.06 speaker1  Big holes. Big holes?
2693.50 2724.86 speaker2  Drones. Anti-drone. Certainly. Again, probably just normal. Yeah, I think going anti-new tech would be good. Yeah. Now he fears and hates it. Oh, that sucks. Now we're getting to the sad part of Cal-Colorado. That's...
2723.34 2727.90 speaker3  Well, that's the end.
2726.62 2734.78 speaker2  He'll find a way out. Maybe through his daughter. Maybe. That'd be cool.
2732.86 2746.06 speaker3  The strength of love, Zach. Man...
2744.22 2751.50 speaker1  Or are you a fucking little bitch?
2750.46 2767.26 speaker2  All right, so yeah. Okay. He's gonna... That's perfect for this. Because Joe doesn't have...
2766.86 2771.74 speaker1  Sit down. Sit back down.
2768.86 2811.10 speaker2  Fight, flight, or freeze. Okay. Five, so fight. He punches Kurt in the face. Thank you.
2810.22 2817.98 speaker3  I'm in danger.
2817.10 2828.86 speaker2  Which is a... Yeah, let's start with...
2827.02 2840.78 speaker3  It's life-ruining and it's perfect.
2840.06 2845.34 speaker2  This is the end. Do you think that's a good one? Yeah, it's perfect because it's your last one. Yeah, it's absolutely perfect.
2844.62 2849.98 speaker3  It sucks. It's perfect.
2849.26 2877.90 speaker2  I love it. I love you. Let's go ahead and fight. Record it for real. Fight, flight, or freeze. Really good stuff. D6, right? We're pulling a long one here at PTBP tonight.
2877.58 2898.62 speaker3  It's not. You didn't put them in order. Okay, I'll reroll. Let's see. In the situation... Because I'm not in the situation. I'm observing it. Most likely would be freeze, and then flight, and then fight. Okay, sounds good. Roll a d6.
2898.22 2917.10 speaker2  Okay. Daddy.
2913.50 2934.86 speaker3  And then that physical reaction makes him think, what the fuck am I looking at? This is real. And he doesn't want to see it anymore, so he's gonna just try to probably violently knock the controller out of Kurt's hand.
2934.14 2941.18 speaker2  Thank you.
2939.90 2949.58 speaker3  Is it good for the story?
2948.70 2968.38 speaker2  It's the moment. It's what happens. This is classic what happens.
2967.74 2970.54 speaker1  Welcome on back.
2970.22 2987.98 speaker2  Gotcha.
2986.06 2997.26 speaker1  Flee is his second likely. And fight is least likely. Absolutely.
2996.94 3007.34 speaker3  Six. It's a sixer.
3006.30 3047.60 speaker2  Unarmed combat. I gotta fail. Cal passes, so what he said earlier happens. Punches Kurt in the face. Which literally knocks him so far out of the way that when Julius goes to knock the drone Like he was hunched. He was like sitting on his feet kind of. Complete. Super rude. If you could roll a D4.
3047.10 3074.94 speaker1  Four? We saw something so scary we had to punch you.
3073.82 3080.30 speaker2  Oh my god.
3079.50 3120.14 speaker1  What was that? What are you doing? It's these fucking drones. They're gonna take all our fucking jobs. And nobody needs to see that shit. Hold on. It would just be you and me.
3114.70 3183.74 speaker2  As you scream that you're looking at this screen and the drone went all herky jerky when your boy daddy got knocked to the ground. And so the last thing this camera sees before you're turning it off is this creature which you see now. It's a person but its eyes are like too high on its face and kind of a little bit further out and its ears are on the top of its head. It's a fucking koala bear. And its nose is like dark. You all see as it flies slow-mo through the air. A block away into the river. Oh yeah, directly in the trash. Whatever. That's a big pile of garbage on the city streets.
3179.90 3189.42 speaker1  They remain staring now at the ground where that screen used to be.
3186.06 3208.30 speaker2  He shudders and like his whole body shakes. And he says, Kurt, Daddy, I'm really sorry. Don't tell anybody about this.
3204.54 3216.22 speaker1  Why, why would you do that, man?
3213.98 3219.04 speaker2  My friend, Dr. Brock Hargrave.
3218.54 3223.26 speaker1  Okay.
3221.10 3252.54 speaker2  My friend, Dr. Bark, Brock Hargrave. I'm going to go to the foundry and have a fucking drink.
3250.94 3274.70 speaker3  Did you get that on camera? Oh shit.
