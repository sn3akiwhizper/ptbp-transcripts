00:00.000 --> 00:06.420
Greetings my disciples, it is your leader in prayer and song, Wolf the Dog, and I am

00:06.420 --> 00:11.540
here to preach the good word about all the happenings in this silly thing we call life.

00:11.540 --> 00:17.760
I'm also here to tell y'all about how to attain true salvation and get y'all into dumps to

00:17.760 --> 00:18.760
meet heaven.

00:18.760 --> 00:22.240
The one true secret to life and happiness is...

00:22.240 --> 00:26.920
Oh wait, before that we got a show to run here y'all, apologies.

00:26.920 --> 00:31.300
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Doug Blake, who recommended pretending to be people

00:31.300 --> 00:32.300
on Facebook.

00:32.300 --> 00:39.900
I mean, this week's Howlin' with Wolf is an Ari Manstein event review by ZomBenny2099.

00:39.900 --> 00:44.680
The location for this event could not have been better, set among the classically themed

00:44.680 --> 00:48.640
mausoleum littered venue that is the city cemetery.

00:48.640 --> 00:54.260
The Samba Stone family plots lent a sense of reverence that most crawfish boils sadly

00:54.260 --> 00:56.100
lack these days.

00:56.100 --> 01:01.400
Upon my arrival I was instantly hit with sweet and savory smells that reaffirmed my hopes

01:01.400 --> 01:03.960
that this would be a boil to remember.

01:03.960 --> 01:08.220
But alas, the only thing I will remember is my disappointment.

01:08.220 --> 01:14.320
First and foremost the service was terrible, there weren't even any eating utensils provided.

01:14.320 --> 01:20.080
I actually witnessed a hip, well dressed young man, obviously from the city, resort to eatin'

01:20.080 --> 01:23.660
straight from the pot as no one came to serve him.

01:23.720 --> 01:27.440
Needless to say, I never actually got to taste any crawfish.

01:27.440 --> 01:31.800
Equally as disappointing, the music was nonsensical.

01:31.800 --> 01:37.000
I'm as down with new age music as the next city dweller, but this was just weird gibberish

01:37.000 --> 01:41.560
that seemed to last forever and yet was over as soon as it began.

01:41.560 --> 01:46.580
I was not alone in thinking this as several frustrated diners shot the DJ.

01:46.580 --> 01:51.880
It was around this time that I took my leave, disappointed and hungry.

01:51.900 --> 01:57.740
Still, all things considered, not the worst crawfish boil I've been to, two and a half

01:57.740 --> 01:59.820
stars out of five.

01:59.820 --> 02:04.980
You know, Wolf ain't never been to a crawfish boil that didn't have some kinda crazy shit

02:04.980 --> 02:06.420
go down.

02:06.420 --> 02:11.740
But all that crazy shit always leads to a massive reward at the end of the night when

02:11.740 --> 02:18.820
they dump out all them shells into the trash, a treasure trove of candy red exoskeletons

02:18.820 --> 02:25.040
discarded by the masses, all so your old little old wolf can take a Scrooge McDuck

02:25.040 --> 02:31.280
dive into them, swimmin' around gettin' my fill with my mouth wide open.

02:31.280 --> 02:35.620
That is the kinda spicy bug I like to eat.

02:35.620 --> 02:40.480
So anyway, you need to remember, if you wanna write up somethin' for your wolf to how, tag

02:40.480 --> 02:46.100
at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter, tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook, or write

02:46.100 --> 02:51.160
a five-star review and email us at PretendingPod at Gmail.com.

02:51.160 --> 02:57.960
You are due to get bruised and lose your shoes if you choose to snooze on the news, baby.

02:57.960 --> 03:01.840
Keith Vigna was shoved into a secret room in Jim Cook's house.

03:01.840 --> 03:07.400
Clark Bishop found a well-worn VHS tape of his parents playing Wheel of Fortune and winning

03:07.400 --> 03:09.080
a honeymoon.

03:09.080 --> 03:14.400
John Lee Pettymore found an envelope with a letter from Jim Cook alongside three folders

03:14.400 --> 03:17.700
outlining three different operations.

03:17.700 --> 03:23.640
The group recovered at a walk-in clinic before toolin' up and enterin' Marvin Glass's playground

03:23.640 --> 03:26.940
through a trap door like great in an alleyway.

03:26.940 --> 03:33.940
Speaking of playgrounds, I hear those PretendingToBePeople boys are gonna be playin' around and loitering

03:33.940 --> 03:35.820
on Twitch this Friday.

03:35.820 --> 03:43.060
They can be found at twitch.tv slash pretendingpodstreams.

03:43.080 --> 03:47.240
I hear one of those boys might sound a lot like me.

03:47.240 --> 03:50.000
Yeah, right, that'd be crazy, y'all.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.320
Aw, hell yeah, the thought of those boys streamin' has Wolf's face beamin'.

03:55.320 --> 04:01.200
But until then, I'll keep dreamin' and dreamin' of incessant screamin'.

04:01.200 --> 04:07.280
It's Kudzu with no backbone.

04:13.060 --> 04:40.800
Let it pop, pop, pop, pop, in your butthole pop.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.840
Put all the poppers in your butthole now.

04:42.840 --> 04:44.620
Put them up there and lick them real good.

04:44.620 --> 04:45.620
Let me get that popper.

04:45.620 --> 04:47.440
Make it a spicy butthole.

04:47.440 --> 04:49.600
Spicy butthole in my pants.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.480
Spicy butthole does my dance.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.920
I like dancing with my butt.

04:53.920 --> 04:56.080
You will like me when I strut.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.080
Strut.

04:57.080 --> 04:58.080
Oh!

04:58.080 --> 05:00.080
Luke, what'd you do for your birthday?

05:00.080 --> 05:06.640
I literally woke up, sat on my couch, smoked weed all day, and watched Twitch.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.640
Nice.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.020
What'd you watch on Twitch?

05:09.020 --> 05:17.700
I watched, well, at 8 p.m. is when Lord Caboon plays Grand Theft Auto roleplay.

05:17.700 --> 05:21.500
So I watched that from about 8 p.m. until 3 in the morning.

05:21.500 --> 05:22.500
That's Mr. Chang.

05:22.500 --> 05:23.580
That's Mr. Chang.

05:23.580 --> 05:24.580
He's my favorite.

05:24.580 --> 05:28.740
The voice is a fun character.

05:28.740 --> 05:35.300
Anyway, he's also, I think, the most watched Grand Theft Auto roleplayer on Twitch.

05:35.300 --> 05:36.300
He's a lot of fun.

05:36.300 --> 05:37.780
Anyway, I did that, and I also watched.

05:37.780 --> 05:38.780
It is a lot of fun.

05:39.780 --> 05:41.940
I watched a movie called About Time.

05:41.940 --> 05:46.060
Oh yeah, with Donal Gleason.

05:46.060 --> 05:47.060
Is that his name?

05:47.060 --> 05:48.060
That's Brendan Gleason's son.

05:48.060 --> 05:49.060
No way.

05:49.060 --> 05:50.060
Yeah, Matt I. Moody's son.

05:50.060 --> 05:51.060
Which I didn't know for a long time.

05:51.060 --> 05:54.500
Oh yeah, because he's also in a couple, or maybe one Black Mirror episode.

05:54.500 --> 05:55.500
The fucking fairytale.

05:55.500 --> 05:56.500
Yeah.

05:56.500 --> 06:00.260
But no, it was an enjoyable movie, cheesy at times, but I also love Rachel McAdams.

06:00.260 --> 06:01.260
Oh yeah.

06:01.260 --> 06:04.380
And I forgot, well, didn't forget, but Margot Robbie was in it as well.

06:04.380 --> 06:05.500
Oh, I didn't remember that.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.260
Isn't Bill Nye the dad in that?

06:07.260 --> 06:08.260
Is that how you say his name?

06:08.740 --> 06:09.740
Wait.

06:09.740 --> 06:10.740
I think it's Nye.

06:10.740 --> 06:11.740
Nye.

06:11.740 --> 06:12.740
Oh, I thought you said Bill Nye.

06:12.740 --> 06:13.740
I'm like, no.

06:13.740 --> 06:14.740
Bill Nye, the British guy.

06:14.740 --> 06:15.740
Yeah, no.

06:15.740 --> 06:16.740
I very much enjoyed it.

06:16.740 --> 06:17.740
Bill Nye.

06:17.740 --> 06:18.740
And before I watched About Time, I watched.

06:18.740 --> 06:19.740
Peach, Bill Nye.

06:19.740 --> 06:27.700
I watched some Chef's Table, and I watched a guy play this survival game, I don't remember,

06:27.700 --> 06:28.820
something dark.

06:28.820 --> 06:29.940
Long Winter or something like that?

06:29.940 --> 06:31.380
The Long Dark is what it was called.

06:31.380 --> 06:32.380
The Long Dark.

06:32.380 --> 06:33.380
Nice.

06:33.380 --> 06:36.180
But yeah, I ordered Postmates slash Uber Eats twice.

06:36.180 --> 06:37.180
Oh wow.

06:37.180 --> 06:38.180
Yeah.

06:39.100 --> 06:40.100
Fucking birthday baby.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.100
Yeah, you really hit it up.

06:41.100 --> 06:44.300
And I was thinking about going to Cherry Picker later in the night, and I was like, you know

06:44.300 --> 06:45.300
what?

06:45.300 --> 06:46.300
Fuck it.

06:46.300 --> 06:47.300
I'm literally not going to change out of my pajamas.

06:47.300 --> 06:48.780
I had a great time.

06:48.780 --> 06:49.780
Hell yeah.

06:49.780 --> 06:50.780
Well, heck yeah.

06:50.780 --> 06:51.780
And you can finally vote.

06:51.780 --> 06:52.780
I can finally vote now.

06:52.780 --> 06:55.780
Yeah, listeners, Luke is legal.

06:55.780 --> 07:00.780
You can vote at 16 in Missouri.

07:00.780 --> 07:01.780
Yeah.

07:01.780 --> 07:07.900
We've been trotting out this jail bait for you, but Lukey boys are all grown up.

07:07.900 --> 07:12.860
When I was younger, I leaned very much to the left, but you know, my parents, a lot

07:12.860 --> 07:16.580
of older people say like, once you get older, you'll be more conservative.

07:16.580 --> 07:21.460
And yesterday I woke up and I was like, damn, I kind of want to vote for Donald Trump today.

07:21.460 --> 07:23.500
Oh my God.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.380
Well that's legitimately horrifying.

07:25.380 --> 07:26.380
Happy birthday.

07:26.380 --> 07:27.380
Yeah, thank you very much.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.980
No, that'll never happen.

07:28.980 --> 07:31.120
Listeners, I'm kidding.

07:31.120 --> 07:32.120
Happy birthday.

07:32.120 --> 07:35.460
Unless you like Donald Trump, then give us more of your money.

07:35.460 --> 07:36.460
Yeah.

07:36.460 --> 07:37.460
Pledge to us, not him.

07:37.460 --> 07:43.740
So, uh, Joe, when Joe got into the home today, he opened up the fridge to grab one of the

07:43.740 --> 07:44.800
beers that he brought.

07:44.800 --> 07:47.380
And then he just started giggling like a madman.

07:47.380 --> 07:49.380
I bought myself some long neck Coronas.

07:49.380 --> 07:54.100
It turns out they weren't all long.

07:54.100 --> 07:59.260
I had somehow bought the seven ounce Corona bottles that for some reason look like long

07:59.260 --> 08:04.780
necks coming out of the top of the six pack, but they just got little stubby bottle bottoms.

08:04.780 --> 08:06.580
Why did they make those?

08:06.580 --> 08:07.580
For the light drinker?

08:07.580 --> 08:08.580
I guess.

08:08.580 --> 08:09.580
I don't know.

08:09.580 --> 08:10.580
Well, wow.

08:10.580 --> 08:11.580
It's for kids.

08:11.580 --> 08:14.620
Well, I mean, what is the drinking age in Mexico?

08:14.620 --> 08:15.620
21.

08:15.620 --> 08:20.460
No, it's, I drank when I was like 14 there.

08:20.460 --> 08:21.460
That's so cool.

08:21.460 --> 08:22.460
Like two years ago.

08:22.460 --> 08:23.460
Yeah.

08:23.460 --> 08:27.660
I went to the swim up bar and I was like, I like, whatever that drink is, it looks good.

08:27.660 --> 08:30.020
And it was like a, like a mudslide or a white Russian or something.

08:30.020 --> 08:32.420
And I drink and I was like, tastes good, but kind of bad.

08:32.420 --> 08:34.540
And then my dad was like, what the fuck are you like?

08:34.540 --> 08:39.420
I didn't do it on purpose, but she didn't get a boner in the pool and that's why you

08:39.420 --> 08:40.420
don't like big mouth.

08:40.420 --> 08:41.420
All right.

08:41.420 --> 08:43.900
So I forgot about that.

08:43.900 --> 08:47.980
I mean, I don't hate it, but I mean, I've only, I've only seen like, all right, so let's

08:47.980 --> 08:51.180
get into this episode 39.

08:51.180 --> 08:52.180
That's a big number.

08:52.180 --> 08:56.620
We're almost to a, almost a 30, 30 more to go.

08:56.620 --> 09:00.940
We're almost at, if you listen to us, you could have worked an entire work week, but

09:00.940 --> 09:04.780
instead you enjoyed it with us.

09:04.780 --> 09:06.460
So let's kick it off the bat.

09:06.460 --> 09:12.460
You guys were, I believe, falling through the, the grate in front of the dirty dog grooming.

09:12.460 --> 09:13.460
Is that correct?

09:13.460 --> 09:19.020
The giant building downtown that, you know, is the glass compound or some cool flowers

09:19.020 --> 09:20.020
around.

09:20.020 --> 09:21.020
Absolutely.

09:21.020 --> 09:24.900
Maybe the last time you'll ever see flowers, you know, as you guys are falling, let's go

09:24.900 --> 09:25.900
ahead.

09:25.900 --> 09:30.660
And as you head into the den of sin, as you've been calling it, let's do it.

09:30.660 --> 09:31.660
You called it that.

09:31.660 --> 09:32.660
Yeah.

09:32.660 --> 09:33.660
I certainly did.

09:33.660 --> 09:38.980
As you guys have been calling it, we called it that because you learned it from watching

09:38.980 --> 09:41.520
you.

09:41.520 --> 09:43.980
And as you guys are falling, let's, let's do an equipment check.

09:43.980 --> 09:45.700
Let's see what you guys have on you.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.540
Who wants to start last episode?

09:47.540 --> 09:50.100
I just bought, or I bought three pistols altogether.

09:50.100 --> 09:53.700
I've got two in the waistband and one in my boot.

09:53.700 --> 09:58.720
And then a John Lee Pettymore bought us all a couple of flash grenades, a couple of regular

09:58.720 --> 10:00.480
grenades and a couple of smoke grenades.

10:00.480 --> 10:01.480
Cool.

10:01.480 --> 10:05.880
And you're also wearing an old school contention, police officers uniform.

10:05.880 --> 10:06.880
Correct.

10:06.880 --> 10:07.880
Anything else on you?

10:07.880 --> 10:08.880
I might have one more pistol.

10:08.880 --> 10:12.280
I guess I would still have the one that Maggie gave me to take out, you can have four on

10:12.280 --> 10:13.280
you if you want.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.280
It's a lot of pistols.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.280
Yeah, sure.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.280
All right.

10:16.280 --> 10:20.640
Tell me if it's too meta, but I have giant pockets in my giant shorts.

10:20.640 --> 10:21.640
I don't know.

10:21.640 --> 10:24.760
Maybe I should be carrying your guns at first now.

10:24.760 --> 10:25.760
That's fine.

10:25.760 --> 10:26.760
I hate it.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.040
If I would've thought about it last episode, I would have said it.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.320
He throws it to you while you're falling midair.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.320
Okay.

10:31.320 --> 10:33.280
So what do you have on you Luke?

10:33.280 --> 10:40.560
I have my small but powerful pistol, two frag grenades, two flash grenades, two smoke grenades.

10:40.560 --> 10:46.000
And then on my back I have the giant fully auto machine gun.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.240
Two ARs welded together.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.240
Basically.

10:49.240 --> 10:50.240
Cold fusion gun.

10:50.240 --> 10:53.680
It's like a double neck guitar, but a gun.

10:53.680 --> 10:54.800
That's fucking awesome.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.800
What a great description.

10:56.800 --> 10:57.800
It's balling.

10:57.800 --> 11:02.320
And then, well, I'll ask this later.

11:02.320 --> 11:03.320
And Thomas, what do you have on you?

11:03.320 --> 11:05.840
What does John Lee, Kevin Pettimore have on you?

11:05.840 --> 11:09.500
He's got his robot body.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.760
He's got body armor on top of that.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.740
All the grenades, same as the others.

11:13.740 --> 11:19.760
He's got a powerful pistol with a large magazine and a semi-automatic shotgun.

11:19.760 --> 11:20.760
Absolutely.

11:20.760 --> 11:22.080
Armed to the veritable teeth.

11:22.080 --> 11:25.360
To the veritable teeth indeed, my good sir.

11:25.360 --> 11:26.720
Joe and I were talking.

11:26.720 --> 11:31.240
I think maybe we should say what our health points are before we start, just so the listener

11:31.240 --> 11:32.240
knows.

11:32.240 --> 11:33.240
I think that's really smart.

11:33.240 --> 11:34.840
Let's get a rundown of your health and your sanity.

11:34.840 --> 11:37.320
I am currently at 16 hit points.

11:37.320 --> 11:43.280
I had a maximum of 26 and my current sanity is at 18 with a breaking point at six.

11:43.280 --> 11:51.400
I have 25 out of 25 hit points and my sanity is at 11 with a breaking point of eight.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.400
All right.

11:52.440 --> 11:56.960
That's 19 of 20 hit points and my sanity is at 18.

11:56.960 --> 11:57.960
Good.

11:57.960 --> 11:58.960
Pretty good sanity.

11:58.960 --> 11:59.960
Yeah.

11:59.960 --> 12:00.960
All right.

12:00.960 --> 12:03.680
Does anyone have any final words?

12:03.680 --> 12:08.800
We're here to eat ass and kill bubblegum and we're all out of bubblegum.

12:08.800 --> 12:11.640
You know how that trap door opened at the last episode?

12:11.640 --> 12:14.160
Clark clings to the edge, pulls himself up and leaves.

12:14.160 --> 12:20.400
He just goes back to his house, watches Wheel of Fortune until he dies, until the end of

12:20.400 --> 12:21.400
the world.

12:21.400 --> 12:29.320
It starts out with all of us going, three Wilhelm screams.

12:29.320 --> 12:38.200
Also while we were spot on, I forgot to add while we were at a, unbeknownst to pretty

12:38.200 --> 12:44.260
much anybody at the gun shop, I had filled some of one of the cargo pants.

12:44.260 --> 12:48.740
I went over to the bait shop of the, of the gun store and filled one of my pockets up

12:48.740 --> 12:50.620
with a catfish food.

12:50.620 --> 12:52.900
Oh, very small.

12:52.900 --> 12:53.900
Why catfish?

12:53.900 --> 12:55.100
Have you ever seen catfish food?

12:55.100 --> 12:57.340
It's like real mushy and super stinky.

12:57.340 --> 12:58.980
Is that what you cover your arm with?

12:58.980 --> 12:59.980
Yeah.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.860
Have you ever gone noodling?

13:01.860 --> 13:05.560
I think I might have told this story once, but I went with my dad or my uncle.

13:05.560 --> 13:08.940
We went gigging and noodling one day.

13:08.940 --> 13:09.940
Giggings fun.

13:09.940 --> 13:11.260
You get to eat some frog legs.

13:11.260 --> 13:16.060
Noodling sucks because a catfish bites your fucking arm and that's how you catch it.

13:16.060 --> 13:18.460
So yeah, that sounds like garbage.

13:18.460 --> 13:20.420
Yeah, I'll definitely allow that.

13:20.420 --> 13:21.740
You're supposed to use your dick.

13:21.740 --> 13:23.420
Oh, mine's not big enough.

13:23.420 --> 13:24.420
It's recreation.

13:24.420 --> 13:25.420
Boom.

13:25.420 --> 13:30.820
I can only fold it in half once.

13:30.820 --> 13:31.820
Call back.

13:31.820 --> 13:34.180
Eight times if you really tried.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.820
Uh, anyway, yeah, so I do have that.

13:36.820 --> 13:42.680
As you fall downward into darkness, you almost immediately feel your body's slow and begin

13:42.680 --> 13:48.420
to float gently like you're just hanging weightless in vast nothingness.

13:48.420 --> 13:54.240
And then abruptly a bright light covers your entire field of vision and huge words appear

13:54.240 --> 14:00.520
in front of you in a spray painted font as a rumbling voice reads the massive tag that

14:00.520 --> 14:05.520
says, welcome to the scrap it.

14:05.520 --> 14:10.840
What you can only assume is the biggest Omnimax screen of all time fades to black and a video

14:10.840 --> 14:12.480
begins to play.

14:12.480 --> 14:16.880
It looks to be the inside of an enormous arena made of glass.

14:16.880 --> 14:22.880
In the background, hundreds of screaming spectators in the foreground, a hole begins to form in

14:22.880 --> 14:26.080
the floor and a shadowy form begins to emerge.

14:26.080 --> 14:32.160
But before this person can even hit the lights of the arena, a giant metal tentacle erupts

14:32.160 --> 14:36.620
into view, gripping the humanoid being and ripping it out of frame.

14:36.620 --> 14:41.860
The screen fades to black and you feel your feet touch the ground, your weight coming

14:41.860 --> 14:45.540
back down into your bodies.

14:45.540 --> 14:52.520
You all are standing in a cube of a room 20 feet across, made almost entirely of the oily

14:52.520 --> 14:56.000
obsidian you have previously seen in this building.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.940
It is disorienting.

14:57.940 --> 15:04.420
Across the room is a mouth of a concrete cave with the logo for the scrap pit spray painted

15:04.420 --> 15:06.060
above its entrance.

15:06.060 --> 15:12.160
To your left are two guards standing in front of a red, deep buttoned plush door.

15:12.160 --> 15:14.500
The guards are in full brown jumpsuits.

15:14.500 --> 15:17.720
They each have a large scythe strapped to their backs and the blade of each scythe is

15:17.720 --> 15:19.760
shaped like an enormous fish hook.

15:19.760 --> 15:24.640
A closer look reveals these men have unnatural matching faces.

15:24.640 --> 15:28.360
Their eyes are far apart, almost on either side of their face.

15:28.360 --> 15:33.560
Their noses do not jut out but are rather two slits above their two wide thick lipped

15:33.560 --> 15:37.480
mouths and they have a few flaps on either side of their necks.

15:37.480 --> 15:43.980
They turn and upon seeing you, press a button that lights up green and they move out of

15:43.980 --> 15:47.700
the way to either side of the gaudy door.

15:47.700 --> 15:48.700
What do you do?

15:48.700 --> 15:49.780
Noodle them, Keith.

15:49.780 --> 15:59.780
I think we just go, I think, I think, uh, I think we just go right through that door.

15:59.780 --> 16:14.040
We do a little noodle and nod over at them and then we go right past.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.280
Clark wants to look up.

16:15.280 --> 16:19.600
Can I see where we came from or is it, is it a closed space that we fell from?

16:19.600 --> 16:22.280
It is just darkness above you.

16:22.280 --> 16:23.660
What do we see through the doors?

16:23.660 --> 16:30.200
Through the doors is a, another smaller room made completely out of the same oily black

16:30.200 --> 16:31.200
material.

16:31.200 --> 16:34.280
I just feel like we're going to walk into another Marvin Glass stadium.

16:34.280 --> 16:37.340
I mean, I don't really have any other options at this point.

16:37.340 --> 16:41.200
I think we go through the gaudy doors and I mean they hit the green button.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.820
Gotta be better than a hypothetical red button.

16:43.820 --> 16:46.000
Can I see what you guys are picturing?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.680
How are you arranged right now?

16:47.680 --> 16:49.600
Are you two backing him already?

16:49.600 --> 16:53.340
Do you have, he's in the middle and we're escorting them and I on either side.

16:53.340 --> 16:59.760
He's got a gun wound that we literally gave him and I think we're just maybe have your

16:59.760 --> 17:02.780
hands behind your back, but not like cuffed or anything.

17:02.780 --> 17:07.600
And we're like, and we glued dog fur all over him, so he looks real Chewbacca.

17:07.600 --> 17:12.120
But I think we just, we look like he's our prisoner and we're walking him.

17:12.120 --> 17:15.480
I'll keep maybe a sullen head down kind of look on me the whole time.

17:15.480 --> 17:17.480
I like you best when you look like that.

17:17.480 --> 17:23.120
All right, so you guys march him into the, I might emphasize my limp even like look real

17:23.120 --> 17:26.940
wounded and I'm non-threatening, but they've got me handily.

17:26.940 --> 17:31.660
These total fish men absolutely pay attention to your hobble.

17:31.660 --> 17:38.340
You guys march Clark Bishop into this room and the room's interior walls, floor and ceiling

17:38.340 --> 17:44.220
are the same beautiful like onyx obsidian reflector and the door closes behind you.

17:44.220 --> 17:47.900
There's nothing, just the shimmering black mirror on all six sides.

17:47.900 --> 17:51.700
And then you feel the room begin to move.

17:51.700 --> 17:54.760
Who has the lowest luck?

17:54.760 --> 17:55.760
I have 35.

17:55.760 --> 17:56.760
I got 60.

17:56.760 --> 17:57.760
I've got 20.

17:57.760 --> 17:58.760
All righty.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.680
Thomas, go ahead and roll luck for me.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.680
All right.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.600
I'm going to use these dice that Joe got me for the first time.

18:04.600 --> 18:05.600
Nice.

18:05.600 --> 18:06.600
Hope they serve you well.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.600
I'm going to open mine up too.

18:07.600 --> 18:08.600
Oh, okay.

18:08.600 --> 18:09.600
93.

18:09.600 --> 18:10.600
All right.

18:10.600 --> 18:11.600
That's my fault.

18:11.600 --> 18:12.600
I'm so sorry.

18:12.600 --> 18:13.600
Son of a bitch.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.600
I loaded you up.

18:14.600 --> 18:15.600
I'm so sorry.

18:15.600 --> 18:16.600
That's my fault.

18:16.600 --> 18:17.600
I'm so sorry.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.600
Son of a bitch.

18:19.600 --> 18:23.820
I loaded your guys' dice.

18:23.820 --> 18:25.820
I'm the only one getting out of here alive.

18:25.820 --> 18:27.820
I'm going to win.

18:27.820 --> 18:32.100
I'm not going to win.

18:32.100 --> 18:35.100
It's a me, Joe-io.

18:35.100 --> 18:39.260
Wildy Joe.

18:39.260 --> 18:47.760
One of the walls opens, and you are looking into this dark room lit by two lanterns on

18:47.760 --> 18:53.640
either side of the room that have open flames coming from them.

18:53.640 --> 18:59.240
Right in front of you, there are six individuals passed out all in their underwear.

18:59.240 --> 19:06.640
Most are pretty rough-looking young children, and one is Oz, Mayhem, Wolf.

19:06.640 --> 19:14.100
They are all unconscious as a group of what I can only describe as grandmothers.

19:14.100 --> 19:15.940
They are older women.

19:15.940 --> 19:23.780
They are all dressed in long skirts and cardigans, and they have their hair up in tight little

19:23.780 --> 19:27.580
buns like Aunt B. How about that?

19:27.580 --> 19:35.160
They are all humming and walking in a strange pattern around this room, pouring a strange

19:35.160 --> 19:41.600
liquid into the mouths of these six passed out individuals.

19:41.600 --> 19:44.900
Real quick, I just need all of you to roll Sanity for me.

19:44.900 --> 19:45.900
Fail.

19:45.900 --> 19:46.900
38.

19:46.900 --> 19:52.820
Oh my god, I passed 14 on an 18.

19:52.820 --> 19:53.820
Fuck.

19:53.820 --> 19:55.580
I rolled a 33.

19:55.580 --> 19:56.580
Crit fail.

19:56.580 --> 19:57.580
Yeah.

19:57.580 --> 20:04.100
Keith Vigna and Thomas John Lee Pettymore both lose one Sanity, and for this, Joe, I'm

20:04.100 --> 20:08.440
going to have you just take your headphones off and plug your ear holes.

20:08.440 --> 20:09.440
Okay.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.040
And don't read our lips.

20:11.040 --> 20:15.320
This is the first time we've mentioned Joe's embarrassing ear holes instead of ears.

20:15.320 --> 20:18.520
He just has these weird, like a Voldemort-like sucky-

20:18.520 --> 20:23.360
I'm nervous about all the laughter I'm seeing around the room.

20:23.360 --> 20:25.360
He really plugged them.

20:25.360 --> 20:27.360
His mom is a rhino.

20:27.360 --> 20:31.040
Yeah, they are rhino ears.

20:31.040 --> 20:40.660
So as you guys are looking into this room, the two of you see two ethereal spirits that

20:40.660 --> 20:46.740
are hanging above these grandmothers, and one is a black dog and the other is a red

20:46.740 --> 20:53.660
lion, and they are weaving in and out of these grandmothers as they're walking and pouring

20:53.660 --> 20:59.940
this liquid into the mouths of the passed out individuals, and these spirits are diving

20:59.940 --> 21:03.160
in and out of the bodies that are lying in front of you.

21:03.160 --> 21:07.080
Does there seem to be any connection between their movements or who they're diving into

21:07.080 --> 21:09.680
and who the grandmas are giving what it is?

21:09.680 --> 21:10.680
Absolutely.

21:10.680 --> 21:11.680
Okay.

21:11.680 --> 21:14.320
Joe, you can come back now.

21:14.320 --> 21:18.480
I saw some hand gestures coming from Zach over there, and I turned away real quick just

21:18.480 --> 21:22.160
to make sure I wouldn't glean anything from the beautiful sign language you're providing.

21:22.160 --> 21:28.500
Well, they say that you can put mute on a good story and still know what's happening,

21:28.500 --> 21:30.840
but I don't know if that would work for this medium.

21:30.840 --> 21:31.840
Not for this medium.

21:31.840 --> 21:32.840
I don't know, listeners.

21:32.840 --> 21:33.840
Give it a shot.

21:33.840 --> 21:40.240
I am disturbed, and I look at Kevin John, who's like wide-eyed.

21:40.240 --> 21:42.240
What the fuck was that?

21:42.240 --> 21:43.240
I don't know, man.

21:43.240 --> 21:49.020
As you guys are staring at each other, one of the elderly women just walks into the room

21:49.020 --> 21:55.520
with you, and the door shuts behind her, and she just turns to face the door and stands

21:55.520 --> 21:57.520
there.

21:57.540 --> 21:59.540
Blergeith.

22:03.340 --> 22:04.340
I don't say anything.

22:04.340 --> 22:08.060
I just stand there hoping that this elevator goes to someone we can talk to.

22:08.060 --> 22:11.660
It continues moving, and she turns around to the two of you.

22:11.660 --> 22:13.620
Oh, do you have a prisoner?

22:13.620 --> 22:14.620
We do.

22:14.620 --> 22:15.620
Yes.

22:15.620 --> 22:16.620
What did he do?

22:16.620 --> 22:17.940
He betrayed Marvin Glass.

22:17.940 --> 22:23.420
Well, that is not a good idea, young sir, she says to Clark Bishop.

22:23.420 --> 22:24.420
That's why we brought him here.

22:24.420 --> 22:26.180
He needs to be punished.

22:26.200 --> 22:29.640
Well, we'll certainly make sure that he's punished, won't we?

22:29.640 --> 22:30.640
I hope so.

22:30.640 --> 22:31.640
You better.

22:31.640 --> 22:34.600
But we'd like, yeah, we'd like to tell- We need him for a while first, though.

22:34.600 --> 22:40.080
We need to tell somebody higher up, well, I was, I don't know who you are, but if you

22:40.080 --> 22:43.120
could get us to somebody, I was tasked with a major-

22:43.120 --> 22:44.120
He's new.

22:44.120 --> 22:49.840
I was tasked with something major for Marvin, and he got in my way and made that task impossible.

22:49.840 --> 22:51.880
Oh, I'm sure you were, honey.

22:51.880 --> 22:54.080
This is Keith Vigna.

22:54.100 --> 22:57.460
He's going to be around working for us for a while, why don't you go ahead and introduce

22:57.460 --> 22:58.460
yourself?

22:58.460 --> 22:59.460
Oh, hi Keith.

22:59.460 --> 23:05.140
Kevin, thank you for making me aware of not introducing myself, I'm so sorry, that's such

23:05.140 --> 23:07.540
rude manners of mine.

23:07.540 --> 23:13.220
Keith Vigna, my name is Ursula, it's very nice to meet you, Ursula Oscythe, it's very

23:13.220 --> 23:14.220
nice to meet you.

23:14.220 --> 23:18.060
It's nice to meet you as well, I can't look, or I am looking forward to working with you

23:18.060 --> 23:19.060
in the future.

23:19.060 --> 23:23.160
Ursula, you could say it better than me, why don't you tell Keith a little bit about what

23:23.160 --> 23:25.140
you and the others like you do here?

23:25.140 --> 23:27.220
Oh, well of course, yeah, welcome.

23:27.220 --> 23:34.980
So basically what we do is we carry on a very old tradition of making sure that the sacrifices

23:34.980 --> 23:37.700
are ready to be useful.

23:37.700 --> 23:38.920
And how do you go about that?

23:38.920 --> 23:45.920
As you well know, it's a long drawn out process of lots of ingredients and lots of words and

23:46.100 --> 23:53.100
lots of specific directions and maths, but after some time we're able to put together

23:53.460 --> 24:00.460
a nice sort of change of blood for those that we bathe in our fun time juice.

24:01.460 --> 24:07.900
Oh, I think I've heard of, Kevin's been telling me about, it sounds like a fun time, you know,

24:07.900 --> 24:08.900
all around.

24:08.900 --> 24:09.900
It is, it absolutely is.

24:09.900 --> 24:15.420
And I know that you seem to be looking for someone to speak to, Keith Vigna, is that

24:15.420 --> 24:16.420
right?

24:16.420 --> 24:25.180
Well, I had spoken with Marvin just earlier today and I was supposed to do something for

24:25.180 --> 24:30.560
him and I need to talk with him and let him know what happened and ask him what I can

24:30.560 --> 24:31.560
do next.

24:31.560 --> 24:37.200
The door begins to open and she says, well, I'm sure you're going exactly where you need

24:37.200 --> 24:38.200
to.

24:38.200 --> 24:39.200
Nice to meet you.

24:39.200 --> 24:41.600
And then motions for you to get off the elevator.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.560
Have a good one, Ursula.

24:43.560 --> 24:46.340
Good to see you, Kevin.

24:46.340 --> 24:51.900
And then I think in my head, we're probably supposed to get off here.

24:51.900 --> 24:52.900
Yeah, Keith.

24:52.900 --> 24:53.900
Yeah.

24:53.900 --> 24:54.900
Yeah, you get out.

24:54.900 --> 24:55.900
Let's do it.

24:55.900 --> 24:56.900
Let's do that.

24:56.900 --> 24:57.900
Get the fuck out of the elevator.

24:57.900 --> 24:59.460
I didn't say it out loud.

24:59.460 --> 25:01.140
This is my elevator now.

25:01.140 --> 25:03.740
She was totally hitting on me, right?

25:03.740 --> 25:07.100
Dude, did you see the way she looked at you?

25:07.100 --> 25:08.100
That was weird.

25:08.100 --> 25:09.100
Wow.

25:09.100 --> 25:10.940
She's kind of old, but she's not that bad looking.

25:10.940 --> 25:13.120
Ursula, it's not maybe the name I would pick.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.120
All that torturing kept her fit.

25:15.120 --> 25:16.120
Okay.

25:16.120 --> 25:18.120
We walk off the elevator.

25:18.120 --> 25:22.640
You guys are still having this conversation and the camera zooms out and you are in a

25:22.640 --> 25:24.200
massive room.

25:24.200 --> 25:31.180
The door is already shut behind you and this room is dark and it is damp and you smell,

25:31.180 --> 25:37.580
you know that like that kind of YMCA kind of aquarium kind of smell going on?

25:37.580 --> 25:38.800
Nasty chlorine.

25:38.800 --> 25:39.800
Yes.

25:39.800 --> 25:46.060
It is endless and it smells fucking terrible and also extremely fishy.

25:46.060 --> 25:50.020
If there was a place to do noodling, it would be here.

25:50.020 --> 25:51.260
Get your arm ready.

25:51.260 --> 25:57.580
Looking out, you see that there is a grid of catwalks that are absolutely infinite going

25:57.580 --> 25:59.020
away from you.

25:59.020 --> 26:09.020
Above them is a light fog and this is all hanging over dark greenish murky water below.

26:09.020 --> 26:10.200
It's open water below us.

26:10.200 --> 26:16.160
It is open water below you and in the squares of the grid in the opening where the catwalks

26:16.160 --> 26:24.600
are not covering, hanging from the foggy darkness above are rusty moss covered chains.

26:24.600 --> 26:30.200
Now some of the chains are just hanging like 10 feet out of the water and some of the chains

26:30.200 --> 26:33.520
go all the way in the water.

26:33.520 --> 26:39.780
In the distance, you see that a handful of these have people hanging from them.

26:39.780 --> 26:43.140
Are they alive or are they corpses?

26:43.140 --> 26:45.780
They are small in your view.

26:45.780 --> 26:46.780
They're far away.

26:46.780 --> 26:48.220
No, they're small.

26:48.220 --> 26:49.220
They're just tiny people.

26:49.220 --> 26:50.220
I mean, I've seen one of those.

26:50.220 --> 26:52.820
They're hanging at the bottom of the chains.

26:52.820 --> 26:53.820
Still above the water.

26:53.820 --> 26:54.820
Above the water.

26:54.820 --> 26:55.820
Still well above the water.

26:55.820 --> 26:56.820
Gotcha.

26:56.820 --> 26:57.820
Yes.

26:57.820 --> 26:58.820
This is spooky.

26:58.820 --> 26:59.820
Let's keep moving.

26:59.820 --> 27:01.460
Dude, that's a really cool image.

27:01.460 --> 27:06.800
I just picture that so well in my brain and it's creepy and kind of beautiful in a weird

27:06.800 --> 27:07.800
way.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.800
Green fog, like on a swampy.

27:09.800 --> 27:13.640
I mean, you said they're far away, but can we see movement from any of them that are

27:13.640 --> 27:14.640
hanging?

27:14.640 --> 27:15.640
Yeah.

27:15.640 --> 27:19.680
And let's go ahead and roll alertness for me or search depending.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.280
You can each roll on this one.

27:21.280 --> 27:24.280
I'll give it to you.

27:24.280 --> 27:27.760
Sixteen on a 60 for alertness.

27:27.760 --> 27:29.760
Forty one on a 70 for alertness.

27:29.760 --> 27:32.180
I got a 38 on 60 for alertness.

27:32.180 --> 27:33.180
All right.

27:33.180 --> 27:34.180
Did we all pass?

27:34.180 --> 27:35.180
Mm-hmm.

27:35.180 --> 27:36.180
Nice.

27:36.180 --> 27:37.180
Group success.

27:37.180 --> 27:38.180
We're alert as fuck.

27:38.180 --> 27:39.180
You guys get to see everything.

27:39.180 --> 27:43.500
Oh, you guys get to see everything.

27:43.500 --> 27:47.060
Is that still Ursula talking?

27:47.060 --> 27:48.620
Only for Kevin.

27:48.620 --> 27:56.520
So you see there is only one guard in sight and it is one of these unnatural looking fish

27:56.520 --> 27:58.500
men wearing a brown jumpsuit.

27:58.520 --> 28:06.200
You also hear three voices in the unseen darkness across the enormous chamber.

28:06.200 --> 28:12.640
And because you guys rolled so well, you're going to recognize the voices that you hear.

28:12.640 --> 28:15.520
Keith, one of them is Francis Beans.

28:15.520 --> 28:16.520
My niece.

28:16.520 --> 28:17.520
Your niece.

28:17.520 --> 28:21.240
The other two are voices that you guys haven't heard in a while.

28:21.240 --> 28:24.920
It is Kathy and George Piston.

28:24.920 --> 28:25.920
Oh.

28:25.920 --> 28:26.920
Wow.

28:26.940 --> 28:28.940
It's been a while.

28:28.940 --> 28:29.940
Days even.

28:29.940 --> 28:35.700
Now, if you'll remember Kathy and George Piston, George is Leo's brother, Leo Piston, and they

28:35.700 --> 28:39.420
run the Piston Pig Farm and the Piston Junkyard.

28:39.420 --> 28:40.780
Keith spent some time out there.

28:40.780 --> 28:42.700
I believe Kathy shot him in the foot.

28:42.700 --> 28:43.700
She did.

28:43.700 --> 28:46.100
I got to take a little trip on her school bus.

28:46.100 --> 28:49.260
Yeah, which was full of about a hundred homeless people.

28:49.260 --> 28:50.260
Yeah.

28:50.260 --> 28:54.080
It was also that junkyard that kind of started us on this entire path where there was a body

28:54.080 --> 28:55.080
that showed up there.

28:55.080 --> 28:56.080
Absolutely.

28:56.140 --> 28:57.140
Where'd your pencil go?

28:57.140 --> 29:00.140
I just dropped it right down there.

29:00.140 --> 29:02.100
Real fast, Keith, what was your brother's name?

29:02.100 --> 29:03.420
Yeah, real fast, Keith.

29:03.420 --> 29:04.800
What was your brother's name?

29:04.800 --> 29:05.800
Was it not Francis?

29:05.800 --> 29:08.300
No, Francis was my niece.

29:08.300 --> 29:13.540
Fucking what was that?

29:13.540 --> 29:14.540
Some knew him.

29:14.540 --> 29:15.540
It has something to do with beans.

29:15.540 --> 29:16.540
Oh, I know what it is.

29:16.540 --> 29:17.540
I know what it is.

29:17.540 --> 29:18.540
It's Fergie.

29:18.540 --> 29:19.540
Fergie.

29:19.540 --> 29:20.540
I was thinking it was Francis.

29:20.640 --> 29:24.520
Go back and look at all the beans names.

29:24.520 --> 29:29.020
There's a pattern there.

29:29.020 --> 29:30.020
So yeah, Fergie makes sense.

29:30.020 --> 29:31.020
Sorry.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.020
Can we hear what they're saying?

29:32.020 --> 29:37.120
You are a little bit too far away from them right now to actually hear what they're saying,

29:37.120 --> 29:40.480
but you just recognize the tenor of their voices.

29:40.480 --> 29:41.680
So we don't have eyes on them?

29:41.680 --> 29:45.360
You can kind of see outlines that would help you realize who they were.

29:45.360 --> 29:47.480
They are like 200 yards away from you.

29:47.480 --> 29:50.060
There is some sort of light source in here.

29:50.060 --> 29:51.360
It's not pitch black at all.

29:51.360 --> 29:52.360
It is not.

29:52.360 --> 29:54.420
No, there is some unseen light source.

29:54.420 --> 29:56.480
Are they like in front of us or do they come from?

29:56.480 --> 29:57.720
Yeah, they're in front of you.

29:57.720 --> 30:02.000
As far as we can tell from here, are they just standing on a random catwalk or is there

30:02.000 --> 30:04.680
something near them that they're maybe congregated near?

30:04.680 --> 30:13.600
Well, it seems like based on those great roles that Francis Beans is standing on a catwalk.

30:13.600 --> 30:16.280
Kathy and George Piston are both hanging.

30:16.280 --> 30:17.280
Gotcha.

30:17.280 --> 30:18.280
Oh wow.

30:18.280 --> 30:19.280
Oh.

30:19.500 --> 30:22.620
This is fucking cool.

30:22.620 --> 30:28.620
I like whispered, do you guys want to, I mean, want to just approach them?

30:28.620 --> 30:31.940
Is it just in front of us that we can walk or can we take other paths?

30:31.940 --> 30:33.620
It's a big old grid, baby.

30:33.620 --> 30:36.460
John, do you know where we are if you've been in here before?

30:36.460 --> 30:38.140
No, unfortunately not.

30:38.140 --> 30:41.820
Do you guys want to go straight at Francis?

30:41.820 --> 30:43.660
We can just like push her over the rail.

30:43.660 --> 30:45.340
I mean, yeah, we could.

30:45.340 --> 30:46.340
One down.

30:46.340 --> 30:47.780
Let her sleep with the fishmen.

30:47.800 --> 30:51.800
We try to get around her, but I don't want to get lost in this place.

30:51.800 --> 30:54.160
We might go talk to Francis, see if she can lead us.

30:54.160 --> 30:55.160
That's true.

30:55.160 --> 30:59.640
We could, if she starts to get violent, we can just three versus one.

30:59.640 --> 31:00.880
She's a little girl.

31:00.880 --> 31:01.880
Just throwing it out there.

31:01.880 --> 31:05.640
We could also wait for her to leave and follow her.

31:05.640 --> 31:10.280
Follow and also maybe rescue Kathy and George and have another, have an army with us.

31:10.280 --> 31:11.480
I don't know.

31:11.480 --> 31:13.080
But maybe also fuck these pistons.

31:13.080 --> 31:14.080
Yeah.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.080
That's also true.

31:15.080 --> 31:18.420
I don't know what it would be to go talk to her, but we can also wait until she leaves

31:18.420 --> 31:20.300
and try to follow her where she's going.

31:20.300 --> 31:22.300
What do you guys think?

31:22.300 --> 31:23.620
I'll do whatever you guys want.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.660
I'm the prisoner right now.

31:25.660 --> 31:29.060
But not in real life.

31:29.060 --> 31:30.820
You can't have that mindset.

31:30.820 --> 31:36.340
Oh man, we've already lost.

31:36.340 --> 31:40.980
It's like when you were a kid and you were trying to get out of school, so you acted

31:40.980 --> 31:44.100
sick, but acting sick made you feel bad.

31:44.120 --> 31:45.800
And then you just wasted a day.

31:45.800 --> 31:50.200
I just mean you guys captured me fair and square and I don't know.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.440
I'm your prisoner, dammit.

31:52.440 --> 31:54.920
I think we should just go, let's go talk to her.

31:54.920 --> 31:55.920
Let's go talk to her.

31:55.920 --> 31:59.760
Worst case scenario, we push her into one of these feed and fish tanks.

31:59.760 --> 32:01.880
Just say, Hey, uh, Hey Frankie.

32:01.880 --> 32:04.440
Uh, well let's, let's walk up and get closer to her.

32:04.440 --> 32:05.440
I say that.

32:05.440 --> 32:07.440
I say, Hey Frankie.

32:07.440 --> 32:13.240
As you guys are walking down the catwalk, you would see you're getting into a section

32:13.260 --> 32:16.100
where there are more people hanging.

32:16.100 --> 32:23.180
Most of them are unconscious and they are all hanging from a fish hook that is going

32:23.180 --> 32:26.780
through their crossed forearms.

32:26.780 --> 32:31.600
So their arms are crossed and through the spot where they are crossing, there is a fish

32:31.600 --> 32:34.500
hook going in both forearms.

32:34.500 --> 32:41.340
I kind of awkwardly nod and wave as the people, as we pass, excuse me, sorry, passing through.

32:42.080 --> 32:48.660
Just one of them sees Kevin and he's like, fuck you, you devil.

32:48.660 --> 32:53.320
Every single mess you've ever made in your life is one more thing that's taken you closer

32:53.320 --> 32:55.440
to hell fire and brimstone.

32:55.440 --> 32:58.440
You absolute piece of devil witch garbage.

32:58.440 --> 33:04.840
I get right up in his face and I say, yeah, I'm going to hell and I'll see you there.

33:04.840 --> 33:06.360
And then I'd poke him in the eye.

33:06.360 --> 33:11.280
Ow, ow, fuck, ow, shit, do you have any eye drops?

33:12.260 --> 33:15.060
As you guys continue, you do see that one of the...

33:15.060 --> 33:16.560
Can I scan other faces?

33:16.560 --> 33:18.940
Is there anybody else here that I recognize or no?

33:18.940 --> 33:26.540
Yeah, as you scan the rest of the faces, you do recognize the body of agent Trent Chad

33:26.540 --> 33:33.300
also hanging from one of these fish hooks and his eyes rise up to meet yours and he

33:33.300 --> 33:36.260
freaks the fuck out.

33:36.260 --> 33:37.260
What?

33:37.280 --> 33:38.280
What?

33:38.280 --> 33:45.600
You guys were, you're dead, you're fucking dead.

33:45.600 --> 33:52.800
He looks at Keith Vigna and Clark Bishop and he's like, what the absolute fuck happened?

33:52.800 --> 33:58.080
The last time I saw you, you, you, you, and, and now you're...

33:58.080 --> 34:03.520
And he kind of notices that Keith is walking a prisoner, Clark Bishop with Kevin.

34:03.520 --> 34:07.120
He's like, you're working with these fucking assholes now?

34:07.140 --> 34:08.300
What is wrong with you?

34:08.300 --> 34:22.020
I stick my tongue out at him and go, wow, have fun DM.

34:22.020 --> 34:28.180
I have absolutely no words for the wretch that you have become.

34:28.180 --> 34:30.980
I say sayonara bitch and then we keep walking.

34:30.980 --> 34:32.260
I want to shoot him a wink.

34:32.260 --> 34:33.260
You can definitely wink at him.

34:33.260 --> 34:34.260
I shoot him a wink.

34:34.260 --> 34:35.920
Does he react at all?

34:35.920 --> 34:37.660
He spits it, Keith.

34:37.660 --> 34:39.060
I keep looking forward.

34:39.060 --> 34:40.060
All right.

34:40.060 --> 34:42.980
As you guys are going, you can hear Francis beans.

34:42.980 --> 34:43.980
All right.

34:43.980 --> 34:50.020
So like, seriously, I'm only going to ask you like one more time.

34:50.020 --> 34:53.980
Who started the fucking outbreak in contention?

34:53.980 --> 34:55.160
Who did it?

34:55.160 --> 34:57.420
Kathy piston spits.

34:57.420 --> 35:02.380
I told you, I don't know what that means.

35:02.380 --> 35:04.100
I don't know what that means.

35:04.100 --> 35:05.100
Where?

35:05.100 --> 35:08.560
Okay, like where is the residue collecting then?

35:08.560 --> 35:10.320
Like you've been in contention this whole time.

35:10.320 --> 35:14.840
So like, just fucking tell me, is the residue collecting in any specific spot?

35:14.840 --> 35:21.560
Kathy is shaking her head and she's like, I, I, and you see that Francis beans has a

35:21.560 --> 35:27.720
lever and she is slowly lowering George piston toward this water.

35:27.720 --> 35:33.920
George begins actually whimpering as he's lowered towards this water and Kathy looks

35:33.940 --> 35:35.940
over at him and she's like, no, for real.

35:35.940 --> 35:38.940
I don't know what residue you're talking about.

35:38.940 --> 35:41.220
I don't know where it would be collecting.

35:41.220 --> 35:46.700
I, I just, I don't think I have any of the answers that you're, and she gets cut off

35:46.700 --> 35:47.700
by Francis again.

35:47.700 --> 35:48.700
Who's like, yeah.

35:48.700 --> 35:49.700
Okay.

35:49.700 --> 35:53.260
Like seriously though, what is the circle of knowledge use the people for?

35:53.260 --> 35:55.060
You of all people should fucking know that.

35:55.060 --> 36:03.780
And Kathy just spits at her client confidentiality and then Francis says, all right, well, or

36:04.760 --> 36:05.880
she's making fun of her.

36:05.880 --> 36:06.880
Yeah.

36:06.880 --> 36:07.880
She's mocking her.

36:07.880 --> 36:09.720
She's mocking her whale.

36:09.720 --> 36:12.920
Have you seen any of them silver spares?

36:12.920 --> 36:17.820
Francis says, were they, uh, like, you know, at the circle or were they in contention?

36:17.820 --> 36:20.480
Have you ever seen any of these things?

36:20.480 --> 36:24.040
And Kathy's just lowers her head.

36:24.040 --> 36:30.000
I'm not gonna George, George, I love you.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.320
I love you.

36:31.320 --> 36:37.300
And George is being dipped slowly into the water and as his feet touch, he starts moaning

36:37.300 --> 36:38.300
out.

36:38.300 --> 36:44.100
He's like, no Lord, please God, if you're out there, I would be willing if you did me

36:44.100 --> 36:47.300
a service right now and just let me.

36:47.300 --> 36:51.620
And Francis is laughing maniacally as she's slowly lowering it.

36:51.620 --> 36:54.700
And if you guys are still walking, you're approaching right now.

36:54.700 --> 36:55.700
Wow.

36:55.700 --> 36:58.500
Yeah, you do.

36:58.500 --> 37:03.240
I don't do anything yet, but there's still part of my brain that was a police officer

37:03.240 --> 37:06.320
that makes me just want to fucking stop this immediately.

37:06.320 --> 37:10.120
I'm trying to get her attention and Francis turns around and the lever stops.

37:10.120 --> 37:12.600
So George is feeder in the water.

37:12.600 --> 37:16.440
She turns around and she's like, Kevin, Oh, God damn it.

37:16.440 --> 37:17.440
Nope.

37:17.440 --> 37:18.440
What?

37:18.440 --> 37:19.440
Just talk like you normally do.

37:19.440 --> 37:20.440
Yeah.

37:20.440 --> 37:21.440
You know what your normal voice.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.440
Here's act with.

37:22.440 --> 37:29.540
Keith fucking Figna, if it isn't you and your new best friend, Kevin, and I see we have

37:29.540 --> 37:33.180
company finally, wait, what the fuck is he doing here?

37:33.180 --> 37:37.460
You were in the room when Marvin told me to, uh, bring Stan Manstein back, right?

37:37.460 --> 37:38.460
Yeah.

37:38.460 --> 37:39.460
He killed Stan Manstein.

37:39.460 --> 37:40.720
What the fuck?

37:40.720 --> 37:44.120
So we're bringing him to Marvin to have a little conversation, try to figure out what

37:44.120 --> 37:47.480
we can do if we can, you know, I just, I didn't want to come back empty handed.

37:47.480 --> 37:48.480
So I brought you something.

37:48.480 --> 37:49.480
All right.

37:49.480 --> 37:51.700
Well, like you were sent down here, weren't you?

37:51.700 --> 37:52.700
Yeah.

37:52.700 --> 37:53.700
Okay.

37:53.700 --> 37:56.080
Then like, I guess hang him up and we'll talk to him now.

37:56.080 --> 37:57.080
Give me a second.

37:57.080 --> 38:01.920
I'm trying to get something good out of these fucking contentioners.

38:01.920 --> 38:02.920
God damn it.

38:02.920 --> 38:03.920
Francis.

38:03.920 --> 38:07.340
Marvin told me he needs to see you upstairs when that's a loose end.

38:07.340 --> 38:09.920
I'm sorry.

38:09.920 --> 38:12.120
Go about your business.

38:12.120 --> 38:16.120
Wait, like what's the loose end?

38:16.120 --> 38:18.300
Like when did he tell you that leaving?

38:18.300 --> 38:19.300
I'm sorry.

38:19.300 --> 38:24.180
I'm a little confused the past few days, but uh, the loose end I was talking about was

38:24.180 --> 38:26.760
you leaving him here dangling, not tortured.

38:26.760 --> 38:29.100
You should torture him a little more.

38:29.100 --> 38:40.640
Roll persuade for me there, Thomas 37 on a 60 very nice.

38:40.640 --> 38:41.660
I think you're right.

38:41.660 --> 38:46.880
I think we should hang him up right now and fucking torture him until he starts talking.

38:46.880 --> 38:49.920
So like, uh, just hold on.

38:49.920 --> 38:50.920
Just hold on right there.

38:50.920 --> 38:54.520
I'm seriously, I'm deadly in the middle of something right now.

38:54.520 --> 38:56.360
And she begins lowering George.

38:56.360 --> 39:01.840
I use my metal hand to whack her in the back of the head and try to knock her out.

39:01.840 --> 39:02.840
Ooh, doggy.

39:02.840 --> 39:03.840
All right.

39:03.840 --> 39:07.800
Uh, you're going to roll unarmed combat against her unarmed combat.

39:07.800 --> 39:10.600
Can I get a plus for my heavy metal hand?

39:10.600 --> 39:13.800
I'll give you a plus to damage for the heavy metal hand.

39:13.800 --> 39:16.000
So I'm rolling a unarmed.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Yep.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.920
It's clearly armed though.

39:20.920 --> 39:21.920
What did she roll?

39:21.920 --> 39:22.920
She rolled a 10.

39:22.920 --> 39:23.920
God damn it.

39:23.920 --> 39:26.040
I rolled an 82 and a 40.

39:26.040 --> 39:29.480
Keith, I'm going to have you roll dexterity.

39:29.480 --> 39:32.320
It's going to be a pretty fucking important dexterity check.

39:32.320 --> 39:34.320
What's your dexterity?

39:34.320 --> 39:36.240
60.

39:36.240 --> 39:37.480
And that's a 90.

39:37.480 --> 39:38.480
Doesn't matter.

39:38.480 --> 39:39.480
It's one 91.

39:39.960 --> 39:47.160
Keith, as you go to whack your niece with your big old metal club hand, she uses your

39:47.160 --> 39:51.440
momentum against you and throws you directly into the water.

39:51.440 --> 39:52.440
God damn it.

39:52.440 --> 39:57.520
Do I, can I do some sort of saving chance to cling onto the side?

39:57.520 --> 40:01.120
That would have been the dexterity that you just rolled and failed.

40:01.120 --> 40:07.080
So as you splash into the water, I need you to roll a sanity check.

40:07.080 --> 40:09.120
Oh, just him?

40:09.120 --> 40:10.120
Just him.

40:10.120 --> 40:11.880
I've failed, but not over my power.

40:11.880 --> 40:12.880
Okay.

40:12.880 --> 40:13.880
26 on him.

40:13.880 --> 40:16.600
Take one sanity damage.

40:16.600 --> 40:17.600
Psychic water.

40:17.600 --> 40:22.880
As you begin fucking panicking at the thought of what is underneath you right now.

40:22.880 --> 40:28.880
Now with that sanity loss, what that reminds you of, do you remember what happened to your

40:28.880 --> 40:32.080
little fish boyfriend, Peter Dieter?

40:32.080 --> 40:33.080
Yes.

40:33.080 --> 40:37.440
You realized that that was an extremely large tank of water.

40:37.440 --> 40:39.040
Just like the one I'm in right now.

40:39.040 --> 40:44.640
Yeah, which is crazy because that means that you are now swimming around with the thing

40:44.640 --> 40:46.680
that you saw inside there.

40:46.680 --> 40:48.640
Are these multiple tanks or one giant tank?

40:48.640 --> 40:52.200
This is one giant tank, baby.

40:52.200 --> 40:56.160
I want to start swimming over to the glass edge of this tank.

40:56.160 --> 40:58.720
Oh, it is not even close.

40:58.720 --> 40:59.960
You can't even see the edge.

40:59.960 --> 41:03.320
I mean, how far above is the catwalk from where I am?

41:03.320 --> 41:04.320
Five feet.

41:04.320 --> 41:05.320
Help me.

41:05.600 --> 41:09.360
Can I, in the confusion of his assail, heaven helps those who help themselves.

41:09.360 --> 41:11.080
Yeah, so we are going to move on.

41:11.080 --> 41:12.820
So Clark actually does get first action.

41:12.820 --> 41:15.320
I would like to finish what Keith tried to do.

41:15.320 --> 41:17.840
I want to try and knock her out.

41:17.840 --> 41:18.840
Okay.

41:18.840 --> 41:19.840
I'm rolling unarmed.

41:19.840 --> 41:20.840
Hell yeah.

41:20.840 --> 41:24.240
I rolled a six on a 70.

41:24.240 --> 41:25.400
Describe what you would like to do.

41:25.400 --> 41:30.440
Well, when Keith went for her and swung wide or whatever happened there, I just seized

41:30.440 --> 41:34.780
that opportunity because she wouldn't have been looking at the prisoner and I just walk

41:34.780 --> 41:37.460
up and wallop her.

41:37.460 --> 41:40.540
It's just a straight punch to the side of her head.

41:40.540 --> 41:41.540
Alrighty.

41:41.540 --> 41:45.820
Go ahead and roll a D6 for damage here.

41:45.820 --> 41:46.820
It's a two.

41:46.820 --> 41:47.820
Alrighty.

41:47.820 --> 41:49.060
You punch her in the head.

41:49.060 --> 41:50.060
Jon, what are you doing?

41:50.060 --> 41:56.260
I would like to use law to try and handcuff her.

41:56.260 --> 41:57.260
Love it.

41:57.260 --> 41:58.260
So you go to handcuff her.

41:58.260 --> 41:59.620
Roll that law check for me.

41:59.620 --> 42:00.620
Fuck.

42:00.620 --> 42:02.620
94 on a 50.

42:02.620 --> 42:03.620
So you go to hand.

42:03.620 --> 42:04.620
Okay.

42:05.460 --> 42:06.460
You guys curse dice.

42:06.460 --> 42:12.980
So you guys are all standing there and Keith goes to swing at her.

42:12.980 --> 42:18.260
She uses his momentum against him and throws him into the water below.

42:18.260 --> 42:23.540
Clark goes swings, punches her, makes a connection as Jon goes around the back and tries to get

42:23.540 --> 42:25.040
her hands in handcuffs.

42:25.040 --> 42:31.660
She wriggles out of his grasp and she kind of backs away and she goes to take off running.

42:31.660 --> 42:34.260
She's going to run toward where you guys came from.

42:34.900 --> 42:35.900
And it is Keith's turn.

42:35.900 --> 42:36.900
What are you doing?

42:36.900 --> 42:43.940
I pull the big, huge gun off my back and I try to use the magazine clips to reach up

42:43.940 --> 42:48.380
to the catwalk and, you know, kind of hike it in there and pull myself up out of the

42:48.380 --> 42:49.380
water.

42:49.380 --> 42:50.380
That's super cool.

42:50.380 --> 42:51.380
That's very smart.

42:51.380 --> 42:57.420
So I'm going to have you roll athletics in order to kick your legs hard enough to lift

42:57.420 --> 42:59.220
your body out of the water enough.

42:59.220 --> 43:00.220
Fucking shit.

43:00.220 --> 43:01.220
Oh boy.

43:01.220 --> 43:02.620
It's a crit fail.

43:02.620 --> 43:03.620
55 on a 50.

43:04.620 --> 43:06.100
Oh damn.

43:06.100 --> 43:07.100
Right there.

43:07.100 --> 43:08.780
I'm going to use different dice.

43:08.780 --> 43:18.500
Keith, as you move your gun into position, the clip lodges itself into the catwalk and

43:18.500 --> 43:24.520
you accidentally click, I'm guessing, a button on a gun that makes a clip pop out and then

43:24.520 --> 43:28.940
the gun slips out of your hands and falls into the water out of your...

43:28.940 --> 43:30.940
It's strapped on my back though.

43:30.940 --> 43:31.940
You rolled a crit fail.

43:32.260 --> 43:35.220
And you took it off your back too.

43:35.220 --> 43:39.060
I like where your head's at, but you done fucked up and you lost your gun.

43:39.060 --> 43:44.720
It's in the water and it is floating down into the darkness past where you can see.

43:44.720 --> 43:48.580
You can barely see your feet in this murky, dark green water.

43:48.580 --> 43:51.700
And above you, this clip is lodged into the catwalk.

43:51.700 --> 43:53.300
Clark, it is your turn.

43:53.300 --> 43:55.260
I'm going to rush her again.

43:55.260 --> 43:56.260
Okay.

43:56.260 --> 43:57.260
She is running away from you currently.

43:57.260 --> 43:58.260
Oh, that's right.

43:58.260 --> 43:59.260
I forgot she was running away.

43:59.260 --> 44:00.260
Do you want to chase after her?

44:00.260 --> 44:01.260
Yeah.

44:01.580 --> 44:02.820
What kind of role would I need for that?

44:02.820 --> 44:04.900
Do I have a run skill?

44:04.900 --> 44:08.780
You would be, well, just tell me what you're going to do and then we'll figure it out from

44:08.780 --> 44:09.780
there.

44:09.780 --> 44:10.780
Well, okay.

44:10.780 --> 44:11.780
The problem is that...

44:11.780 --> 44:12.780
What would Clark do?

44:12.780 --> 44:15.700
You can look at your athletics to know how well you'd hold up in a race.

44:15.700 --> 44:20.980
I've got an idea of what Jon would do that wouldn't take any time or action away from

44:20.980 --> 44:21.980
his turn.

44:21.980 --> 44:22.980
I just want to shout at her.

44:22.980 --> 44:23.980
Know what I'm going to do?

44:23.980 --> 44:25.380
I'm going to turn and help Keith out of the pool.

44:25.380 --> 44:26.380
Yeah.

44:26.380 --> 44:27.980
Take that free action and go ahead and holler.

44:27.980 --> 44:28.980
Francis!

44:28.980 --> 44:29.980
Francis!

44:29.980 --> 44:31.260
The blood just got riled up.

44:31.260 --> 44:32.260
You know, family.

44:32.260 --> 44:34.620
And he's just, you know, he was just trying to wrestle around.

44:34.620 --> 44:35.620
Get back here.

44:35.620 --> 44:37.220
You've got torturing to do.

44:37.220 --> 44:39.060
All right.

44:39.060 --> 44:40.660
So let's get that roll.

44:40.660 --> 44:43.220
How are you helping Keith out of the pool?

44:43.220 --> 44:47.020
I'll lay belly on the catwalk and reach my hands down toward him.

44:47.020 --> 44:48.020
All right.

44:48.020 --> 44:52.420
Keith, I'm going to have you roll luck for a timing situation here.

44:52.420 --> 44:53.420
Nope.

44:53.420 --> 44:54.900
54 and a 35.

44:54.900 --> 44:55.900
Amazing.

44:55.900 --> 44:58.400
And Thomas, do you want to do anything else with your turn here?

44:58.400 --> 45:01.120
Can I do a persuade roll on yelling at her?

45:01.120 --> 45:02.120
Yeah, absolutely.

45:02.120 --> 45:03.120
Yeah.

45:03.120 --> 45:04.120
51 on a 60.

45:04.120 --> 45:05.120
All righty.

45:05.120 --> 45:08.440
And she rolled a 98 to try to fight your persuade.

45:08.440 --> 45:11.560
And so she stops and she turns around.

45:11.560 --> 45:16.440
She's like, crushed her in my mind vice.

45:16.440 --> 45:23.520
She's like, God damn it, Kevin, you know how much I like really like torturing.

45:23.520 --> 45:24.520
Yeah.

45:24.520 --> 45:25.800
And you know Keith's an idiot.

45:25.800 --> 45:28.320
Why don't you come, you know, look, he's in this water.

45:28.320 --> 45:31.000
Come get him, help get him out and then you can torture.

45:31.000 --> 45:36.400
As she's running back toward you, she's yelling at you and she's like, get your prisoner,

45:36.400 --> 45:37.600
handcuff him.

45:37.600 --> 45:43.160
And so you, your attempt to handcuff her was so piss poor that she didn't even realize

45:43.160 --> 45:45.440
you were trying to handcuff her.

45:45.440 --> 45:49.560
And so she's now telling you to get ahold of the prisoner that you had.

45:49.560 --> 45:50.560
Right.

45:50.560 --> 45:52.720
The person I just tried to handcuff.

45:52.720 --> 45:53.720
Exactly.

45:53.720 --> 45:56.560
What a persuade roll you had and two in a row.

45:56.560 --> 45:58.240
I'll definitely count all that.

45:58.240 --> 46:03.960
So Keith, I swim over to the chain that George is hanging from.

46:03.960 --> 46:04.960
So smart.

46:04.960 --> 46:10.160
And I try to crawl up him and up onto the chain in order to at least one, get out of

46:10.160 --> 46:12.620
the water, two to try to get to the catwalk.

46:12.620 --> 46:20.100
And with that absolutely dog shit luck roll that you had earlier, that was for the timing

46:20.100 --> 46:22.320
of the whole situation.

46:22.320 --> 46:33.720
And looking down as you hold on to the body of George piston, you feel this movement from

46:33.720 --> 46:41.940
underneath you and you can hear water moving at a rapid pace and looking down, you actually

46:41.940 --> 46:45.480
see the creature.

46:45.480 --> 46:51.440
It is moving so quickly toward you that all of the grime in the water that is in between

46:51.440 --> 46:54.860
you and it is starting to dissipate as it's coming toward you.

46:54.860 --> 47:00.300
And you see a clear picture of one of these mutated fish men.

47:00.300 --> 47:06.140
But like the one that you saw earlier, it looks exactly like the ones in the Brown jumpsuits,

47:06.140 --> 47:09.780
but it is four times larger.

47:09.780 --> 47:16.360
And both of its legs are kind of like welded together like this one giant fin.

47:16.360 --> 47:21.720
It opens its maw and swims up right at you.

47:21.720 --> 47:22.720
Clark it's your turn.

47:22.720 --> 47:23.720
What are you doing?

47:23.720 --> 47:26.660
You're hanging over the side, but Keith swim away from you.

47:26.660 --> 47:31.240
Fuck, I guess I'm standing up.

47:31.240 --> 47:33.740
I heard the exchange about the cuff thing.

47:33.740 --> 47:34.980
And so I'm going to try and play it cool.

47:34.980 --> 47:38.140
I'm just going to stand back up and that's it.

47:38.140 --> 47:39.260
I mean, yeah.

47:39.260 --> 47:41.940
I yell at Francis, he shot in the leg.

47:41.940 --> 47:42.940
He can't get away.

47:42.940 --> 47:44.300
Help me get Keith now.

47:44.300 --> 47:51.540
She begins running up toward you and Kathy Piston is crying.

47:51.540 --> 47:55.960
George Piston is hollering to his God.

47:55.960 --> 48:01.900
Keith Vigna is crawling up the body of George Piston.

48:01.900 --> 48:07.420
Clark Bishop is standing on the catwalk with his hands behind his back.

48:07.420 --> 48:11.920
And Francis beans is running toward Kevin in her eyes.

48:11.920 --> 48:21.260
John Lee Pettymore to try to grab Keith when all of a sudden this giant fish mouth comes

48:21.260 --> 48:30.300
up from in between the catwalk grid and grabs wholly on to George Piston's body, closes

48:30.300 --> 48:34.880
its mouth and dips back into the water.

48:34.880 --> 48:41.480
The fish hook is just hanging right above the water covered in blood.

48:41.480 --> 48:46.580
And there's a giant splash in the water hits all of your feet.

48:46.580 --> 48:54.200
And the four of you stand there in the wake of the disappearance of Keith Vigna and George

48:54.200 --> 48:55.200
Piston.

48:55.200 --> 48:56.200
Oh no.

48:56.200 --> 49:13.680
I bet I could have helped hear more.

49:26.200 --> 49:55.880
How am I the only one trying to fool over How can you have enough trying to get me to

49:55.880 --> 49:56.880
the end?

49:56.880 --> 49:56.880
