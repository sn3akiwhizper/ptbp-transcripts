00:00.000 --> 00:06.720
Welcome one and all to Contentions most exciting local news radio show, ran by yours truly,

00:06.720 --> 00:08.520
Wolf the Dog.

00:08.520 --> 00:11.120
Now let's jump right into some news.

00:11.120 --> 00:15.300
Now I heard the officers went to Chief Maggie Cook's house, and boy wouldn't you know it,

00:15.300 --> 00:16.300
she wasn't there.

00:16.300 --> 00:20.680
And then they went on over to everybody's favorite bar, Klinker's.

00:20.680 --> 00:25.560
You know, the one with the daycare in the back, serving up all the gourmet treats such

00:25.560 --> 00:31.000
as hot dogs on white bread, ya boy Wolf's favorite meal.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.480
Julie Maxwell had a restraining order put out against Leo Piston back 15 years ago for

00:35.480 --> 00:37.000
killing her sister Ashley.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.360
Now that is some messed up shit.

00:39.360 --> 00:43.720
And John found the Chief's blue notebook, but where was the red and yellow notebooks?

00:43.720 --> 00:48.800
And wouldn't you know it that some idiot at City Hospital fucked up and put Julie Maxwell

00:48.800 --> 00:49.920
in the morgue.

00:49.920 --> 00:53.600
She woke up from a coma and started bloody screaming.

00:53.600 --> 00:59.520
Remember to tell your friends to tune in to 694.2 PTBP for all the hard hitting news

00:59.520 --> 01:02.520
and best variety of music in Contention.

01:02.520 --> 01:09.360
And we got a world premiere of a new song for y'all today, it's Kudzu with no backbone.

01:23.600 --> 01:27.960
County called back about the junkyard body.

01:27.960 --> 01:33.880
Drew looks nervous as he hands you the note, and the note says that body had been dead

01:33.880 --> 01:35.440
for years.

01:35.440 --> 01:44.000
The internal organs seem to have not functioned in roughly two centuries, but the skin and

01:44.000 --> 01:47.700
hair looks to have died on December 1st.

01:47.700 --> 01:52.520
They've never seen anything like this down at County, so go ahead and roll sand for me.

01:52.520 --> 01:53.520
Wowza.

01:53.520 --> 01:54.520
10.

01:54.520 --> 01:55.520
Oh nice.

01:55.520 --> 01:56.520
60.

01:56.520 --> 02:00.520
I mean I assume you have far more than 10 sanity.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.280
I'm feeling real good about hearing that crazy shit.

02:03.280 --> 02:04.280
Yeah.

02:04.280 --> 02:08.560
You immediately play that off in your mind, you rationalize it as either they don't know

02:08.560 --> 02:09.560
what they're doing.

02:09.560 --> 02:10.560
They messed something up.

02:10.560 --> 02:11.560
They messed something up clearly.

02:11.560 --> 02:14.320
You got some time to kill before the Piston Brothers come out.

02:14.320 --> 02:20.280
Clark definitely wants to look at the file on the Ashley case when she was hit by the

02:20.280 --> 02:21.280
car.

02:21.280 --> 02:22.280
Oh the Ashley Maxwell.

02:22.280 --> 02:23.280
Yeah.

02:23.280 --> 02:28.480
Okay, so diving into the old file on the death of Ashley Maxwell, you'd find out that she

02:28.480 --> 02:34.540
was on her way to Splashylvania, the town's weird vampire themed water park to meet up

02:34.540 --> 02:35.540
with some friends.

02:35.540 --> 02:41.920
Clark would remember that Splashylvania used to bring in snow machines in the winter months

02:41.920 --> 02:47.360
and let the townspeople sled down the water slides that use sleds and go down.

02:47.360 --> 02:52.700
This was very obviously a fucking awesome but terrible idea.

02:52.700 --> 02:57.180
And after more than a few broken bones, the water park has only been open in the summer

02:57.180 --> 02:59.360
months for the past decade or so.

02:59.360 --> 03:04.760
So Ashley never showed up to the winterized water park that day on December 1st, so long

03:04.760 --> 03:05.760
ago.

03:05.760 --> 03:08.000
So her sister Julie went looking for her.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.160
Julie found Ashley's body face down in a watery ditch on the side of the road.

03:14.160 --> 03:20.360
She also saw the beat up truck that her former classmate Leo Piston drove around town.

03:20.360 --> 03:22.880
It was heading toward the Piston pig farm.

03:22.880 --> 03:30.280
The autopsy showed that Ashley had a severe concussion but actually died from drowning.

03:30.280 --> 03:36.780
Leo Piston eventually broke down in a testimony and admitted that he had gotten out of his

03:36.780 --> 03:42.660
truck to ask Ashley a question and he must have scared her because she sprayed him with

03:42.660 --> 03:48.860
pepper spray and in his flailing about he accidentally hit her in the head and he immediately

03:48.860 --> 03:51.620
drove home to get water on his eyes.

03:51.620 --> 03:57.940
The Maxwell family, Ashley's family, was fervent in their disbelief of this story but the judge

03:57.940 --> 04:02.480
was easy and gave him one year of juvenile detention.

04:02.480 --> 04:05.860
So that's basically what you would learn from that file.

04:05.860 --> 04:07.440
And what time of day was all that?

04:07.440 --> 04:11.660
Right after school, basically on December 1st, so her and her friends and her sister

04:11.660 --> 04:17.540
and her friends, they were all meeting up to go do the like sledding at Splashylvania.

04:17.540 --> 04:18.540
But she never made it.

04:18.540 --> 04:19.540
Sad.

04:19.540 --> 04:22.960
Who was the officer or detective on that case?

04:22.960 --> 04:28.300
I think the chief would have taken lead for sure on the, yeah, dead teenager.

04:28.300 --> 04:29.300
I dig it.

04:29.300 --> 04:33.780
So that one, that probably took you a while to go through, find all that info.

04:33.780 --> 04:36.300
And yeah, Clark was just doing that to refresh himself.

04:36.300 --> 04:37.300
For sure.

04:37.300 --> 04:38.300
Yeah.

04:38.300 --> 04:39.300
For sure.

04:39.300 --> 04:44.620
This is the first block when an awkwardly tall, skinny man with gin blossoms and bad

04:44.620 --> 04:48.500
teeth walks into the police station and he is visibly distraught.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.860
This is not George Piston.

04:50.860 --> 04:55.140
He walks right past Drew and stumbles a bit into your desk.

04:55.140 --> 05:01.100
You can smell the alcohol in his breath as he mumbles, my friend is gone and you haven't

05:01.100 --> 05:02.500
done anything about it.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.740
Where is this missing person's whatever?

05:04.740 --> 05:06.820
Why aren't you looking for him right now?

05:06.820 --> 05:07.820
Do I recognize him?

05:07.820 --> 05:09.060
You've never seen this guy before.

05:09.060 --> 05:10.060
Whoa, buddy.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.340
Hey, what are you doing?

05:12.340 --> 05:13.340
What's going on here?

05:13.340 --> 05:16.740
My friend is gone and you're not doing anything about it.

05:16.740 --> 05:20.020
I'm standing up and trying to get him to sit down in my chair.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.900
Just he just seems wobbly.

05:21.900 --> 05:24.100
And so, yeah, you can, you can get him down.

05:24.100 --> 05:25.100
Yeah.

05:25.100 --> 05:26.820
Hey, uh, but what's, what's going on?

05:26.820 --> 05:27.940
You're you're, you're talking gibberish.

05:27.940 --> 05:28.940
Yeah, you're fine.

05:28.940 --> 05:33.500
He stands up and he comes around to your side of the desk and starts like messing through

05:33.500 --> 05:34.500
your papers.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.500
Hey, whoa, sir.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.260
Hey, I need you to sit down.

05:37.260 --> 05:39.220
You got to do your fucking job, man.

05:39.220 --> 05:40.220
All right.

05:40.220 --> 05:41.980
I'll listen to you, but you got to sit down first.

05:41.980 --> 05:42.980
All right.

05:42.980 --> 05:43.980
All right.

05:43.980 --> 05:44.980
All right.

05:44.980 --> 05:45.980
What's your name?

05:45.980 --> 05:46.980
Officer Bishop.

05:46.980 --> 05:47.980
Officer.

05:47.980 --> 05:54.140
I just, my friend John Peters is gone and I went by his house earlier and the lock was

05:54.140 --> 06:01.020
busted and there was a mess inside and he hasn't been online in like a couple of days

06:01.020 --> 06:02.540
and that's not like John.

06:02.540 --> 06:10.420
And so I need to, I need to know why you're just sitting here when he's fucking gone.

06:10.420 --> 06:13.020
We, we, uh, we've actually been alerted to that case.

06:13.020 --> 06:14.300
We've, we've been working on it.

06:14.300 --> 06:15.740
Uh, when was the last time you saw him?

06:15.740 --> 06:19.220
I haven't seen him in like forever, honestly.

06:19.220 --> 06:27.440
We just like, you know, he's just an old friend from the days and we used to know each other.

06:27.440 --> 06:39.940
So I, I just, I, he like starts crying and then he like stands up and just walks to the

06:39.940 --> 06:42.840
back of the police station basically.

06:42.840 --> 06:46.120
And he just is like looking around at different stuff.

06:46.120 --> 06:49.020
Hey, hey bud, come up, come back over here.

06:49.020 --> 06:50.280
What's your name?

06:50.280 --> 06:51.280
Your name?

06:51.280 --> 06:53.040
Your, your officer Bishop.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.040
Yep.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.040
You got that right.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.040
Now what's, what's yours?

06:56.040 --> 06:57.040
I'm Charles.

06:57.640 --> 06:59.600
Hey Charles, come, come on back here.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.360
That's let's get to the bottom of this right now.

07:02.360 --> 07:11.040
That's someone, someone fucking, I took my friend I think, and you need to find him.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.320
Why do you think somebody took him?

07:12.320 --> 07:16.520
Because his shit is broke and somebody clearly busted into shit.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.520
Yeah.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.440
Do you have a reason to think that somebody would want to do that?

07:19.440 --> 07:25.360
Well, his fucking keys are gone and his shit was broke and so his car's fucking gone and

07:25.360 --> 07:29.160
like I know John and he wouldn't do that.

07:29.160 --> 07:34.040
So do you know anybody who would want to do that to him with somebody who fucking know

07:34.040 --> 07:36.040
I, John's a chilled ass dude.

07:36.040 --> 07:40.960
I, there's no reason that anybody would want to be taking him.

07:40.960 --> 07:41.960
All right.

07:41.960 --> 07:42.960
We came to that conclusion as well.

07:42.960 --> 07:43.960
Do you have this stuff?

07:43.960 --> 07:44.960
What did you find?

07:44.960 --> 07:45.960
We didn't find a whole lot there.

07:45.960 --> 07:48.880
We are under the assumption at this point that he left in a hurry.

07:48.880 --> 07:57.440
But fucking, yeah, I, someone left in a hurry probably with him cause he wouldn't do that.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.480
Do you have his, do you have his keys?

07:59.480 --> 08:00.480
Yeah.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.480
Yeah.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.480
But we, we, we've got his keys.

08:02.480 --> 08:05.840
Let me see his fucking keys.

08:05.840 --> 08:07.000
Why do you want to see his keys?

08:07.000 --> 08:13.640
Cause I don't, I don't necessarily trust you if you're like yanking me around.

08:13.640 --> 08:17.080
I mean I'm an officer of the law, you can trust me, but just to get this over with,

08:17.080 --> 08:18.080
sure.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.280
Okay.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.280
Cool.

08:20.280 --> 08:23.880
I pull them out of my desk and I'm holding them way far away from him and literally showing

08:23.880 --> 08:24.880
him.

08:24.880 --> 08:25.880
Okay.

08:25.880 --> 08:31.360
He like puts both of his hands like on the desk and leans in and boy howdy does his breath

08:31.360 --> 08:38.560
just reek of booze and he is staring very intently.

08:38.560 --> 08:42.800
He holds his hand out and he gets kind of sad and he's like, can I see him?

08:42.800 --> 08:44.120
Oh no, you can, you can see him.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.120
You can't touch him.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.440
Can I see him with my, with my hand?

08:47.800 --> 08:48.800
I'm sorry, sir.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.320
Uh, have you had something to drink tonight?

08:50.320 --> 08:51.320
Yeah.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.520
How'd you get here?

08:52.520 --> 08:54.120
I got a car.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.120
Did you drive here?

08:55.120 --> 08:56.120
Nah.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.480
If I went outside, would I see a car that wasn't here earlier?

08:58.480 --> 09:13.160
No, I'm, I mean, I, I walked and he leans back, I, uh, I'm putting the keys back in

09:13.160 --> 09:19.480
the desk while that exchange is occurring and just, just give it to me straight officer.

09:23.480 --> 09:27.760
Sir, we, uh, we don't know where your friend is right now, but I can promise you that we

09:27.760 --> 09:34.240
hear a sound from the parking lot of the police station, like abrupt thunder or a small explosion.

09:34.240 --> 09:40.240
Charles, the guy standing in front of you immediately pulls a gun and runs outside.

09:40.240 --> 09:41.240
What do you do?

09:41.240 --> 09:42.240
Holy shit.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.320
Sir, wait, no.

09:43.320 --> 09:44.320
He's fucking.

09:44.320 --> 09:45.320
Stop.

09:45.320 --> 09:46.320
Okay.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.320
If he's already outside, I'm running after him.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.320
Okay.

09:49.320 --> 09:53.800
As you, as you run out the door of the police station, you see the older piston brothers

09:53.800 --> 09:57.640
truck has been T-boned on its driver's side.

09:57.640 --> 10:03.600
A large black SUV is reversing onto the street and begins to drive east.

10:03.600 --> 10:04.600
Roll alertness.

10:04.600 --> 10:05.600
Holy shit.

10:05.600 --> 10:09.600
Uh, 95 on a 70.

10:09.600 --> 10:10.600
Okay.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.960
I didn't see any of that.

10:12.960 --> 10:21.240
You see Leo piston in the driver's seat of this black SUV and you fail to note the license

10:21.240 --> 10:24.040
plate as it begins to drive away.

10:24.040 --> 10:30.000
Charles runs to a car that is parked in the parking lot and gets behind the wheel.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
What do you do?

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
I'm yelling.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
No stop.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Gun is probably drawn.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Yeah.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Gun is drawn on him.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Okay.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Stop.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.840
I'm probably getting around to his driver's side if he's already getting in the car.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.080
Oh yeah.

10:41.080 --> 10:42.080
He's getting in.

10:42.080 --> 10:44.800
Uh, go ahead and roll athletics to get.

10:44.800 --> 10:45.800
So real fast.

10:45.800 --> 10:46.800
Yeah.

10:46.800 --> 10:52.080
The black SUV t-bone t-bone what car George pistons truck, which was sitting in the parking

10:52.080 --> 10:53.080
lot.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.080
Any sign of George?

10:54.080 --> 10:55.080
Yeah.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.080
George is in his truck.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.080
He's been smashed.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.080
You can kind of see him.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.880
He's behind the wheel of his own truck.

10:59.880 --> 11:05.760
So Leo, his brother smashed him in the black SUV driving in the black SUV.

11:05.760 --> 11:06.760
Uh, okay.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.960
So you wanted me to draw a, do athletics.

11:08.960 --> 11:09.960
Yes.

11:09.960 --> 11:13.280
Uh, 61 on a 30.

11:13.280 --> 11:14.280
Okay.

11:14.280 --> 11:20.480
So as you run up to the car that this new fella Charles is in, he backs up and he's

11:20.480 --> 11:25.200
got enough time to get onto the road before you can really get to him.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.200
What do you do?

11:26.200 --> 11:27.600
He's, he's on the road in his car.

11:27.600 --> 11:31.920
He is pulling out of the police station parking lot onto the road.

11:31.920 --> 11:32.920
Fuck.

11:32.920 --> 11:37.000
I am running over to my cruiser and getting on the radio.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.560
We got a situation down here guys.

11:38.560 --> 11:39.560
Come on.

11:39.560 --> 11:40.560
Uh, Oh shit.

11:40.560 --> 11:41.560
Uh, fuck.

11:41.560 --> 11:43.440
Uh, we got a, we got a, uh, a wreck in the parking lot.

11:43.440 --> 11:46.600
There's a, uh, a guy's just taken off gun in hand.

11:46.600 --> 11:47.880
Leo's in a, in a black SUV.

11:47.880 --> 11:49.600
I didn't catch the damn plate.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.880
I need, I need some help down here guys.

11:51.880 --> 11:52.880
Perfect.

11:52.880 --> 11:58.840
Ooh, it's going down.

11:58.840 --> 11:59.840
Everything's happening.

11:59.840 --> 12:00.840
It's all happening.

12:00.840 --> 12:01.840
Nice.

12:01.840 --> 12:02.840
Cool.

12:02.840 --> 12:03.840
Okay.

12:03.840 --> 12:10.440
So if you'll remember, Keith was at the piston pig farm and you had just climbed over the

12:10.440 --> 12:11.440
fence.

12:11.440 --> 12:18.480
Keith, as you walk up on the massive piston pig farm, you see a large farmhouse, a small

12:18.480 --> 12:24.600
farmhouse, a barn, a warehouse, and acres and acres of land.

12:24.600 --> 12:31.880
Leo's old rusty farm truck sits next to the small farmhouse and there is a large SUV next

12:31.880 --> 12:33.920
to the large farmhouse.

12:33.920 --> 12:39.760
Sitting next to the large warehouse is a line of old school buses, most of which are broken

12:39.760 --> 12:44.760
down and have plants and tall grasses growing up in and around them.

12:44.760 --> 12:49.000
Go ahead and roll luck for me.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.880
That's a 19 on a 60, 19 on a 60.

12:53.880 --> 12:54.880
That's a pass.

12:54.880 --> 12:55.880
All right, cool.

12:55.880 --> 13:01.660
So as you approach, as you're walking up to the pig farm, you feel warmth running under

13:01.660 --> 13:03.260
your left foot.

13:03.260 --> 13:09.540
As you realize you hear the sound of a gunshot, you look down and see some blood pooling underneath

13:09.540 --> 13:10.540
your shoe.

13:10.540 --> 13:13.980
Take one point of damage and roll sand.

13:13.980 --> 13:15.620
I failed my sanity check.

13:15.620 --> 13:19.520
Okay, so go ahead and lose one sanity as well as one hit point.

13:19.520 --> 13:20.520
What do you do?

13:20.520 --> 13:21.520
So I'm bleeding.

13:21.520 --> 13:24.540
I want to see where exactly did I get hit?

13:24.540 --> 13:25.540
Right in the foot.

13:25.540 --> 13:26.540
Right in the foot.

13:26.540 --> 13:27.660
Do I know where the gunshot came from?

13:27.660 --> 13:28.980
Like which direction?

13:28.980 --> 13:33.060
Go ahead and roll search.

13:33.060 --> 13:34.060
Don't pass.

13:34.060 --> 13:35.060
Okay.

13:35.060 --> 13:40.100
You're looking around and you hear, you're doing a trespassing there, sir.

13:40.100 --> 13:41.780
I didn't mean to hit you.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.500
Just meant to scare you a bit.

13:43.500 --> 13:46.020
And it's coming from the large farmhouse.

13:46.020 --> 13:52.160
And as you look up to see where this voice is coming from, you see a woman in the window

13:52.160 --> 13:55.540
of the large farmhouse and she's like holding a rifle.

13:55.540 --> 13:58.900
I'm going to like hold my badge up and hold my gun up.

13:58.920 --> 14:02.220
Officer Vigna, I need you to put your weapon down right now.

14:02.220 --> 14:03.220
Oh shit.

14:03.220 --> 14:05.560
Keith, is that you?

14:05.560 --> 14:06.560
It's me.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.460
Little Keith Vigna.

14:08.460 --> 14:09.460
Holy shit.

14:09.460 --> 14:10.460
Yeah.

14:10.460 --> 14:11.580
Do you have a first aid kit in there?

14:11.580 --> 14:12.780
You shot me in the foot.

14:12.780 --> 14:13.780
I am.

14:13.780 --> 14:14.780
God damn it.

14:14.780 --> 14:19.540
She comes running out and she's holding a, she's holding a first aid kit.

14:19.540 --> 14:23.080
And as she runs up to you, she's like, Oh fuck officer.

14:23.080 --> 14:25.220
I am so fucking sorry.

14:25.220 --> 14:26.900
Get that shoe off for me real quick.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.500
I kicked that shoe off.

14:28.500 --> 14:29.500
Okay.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.260
And so also can we do this inside?

14:31.260 --> 14:33.540
Oh yeah, absolutely.

14:33.540 --> 14:38.660
So she'll take you like you can put your arm around her and she'll walk you into the large

14:38.660 --> 14:39.660
farmhouse.

14:39.660 --> 14:40.660
Okay, great.

14:40.660 --> 14:46.920
So she sits you down on a, on an old chair, slides an ottoman over and as you're in here,

14:46.920 --> 14:49.820
you would see this place is, yeah, I want to do like a quick look around.

14:49.820 --> 14:51.740
It's actually kind of nice in here.

14:51.740 --> 14:53.420
It's not too dirty.

14:53.420 --> 14:58.460
There's some stuff about, it's not super tidy, but it's not like overly messy.

14:58.460 --> 15:01.860
And it's not overly gross in any sort of way.

15:01.860 --> 15:06.700
So she'll get your foot up on that ottoman and begin wrapping it.

15:06.700 --> 15:12.140
And she says, seriously, officer, I shit, I did not mean to actually hit you.

15:12.140 --> 15:15.940
I was just, I didn't even recognize you and I didn't see the uniform.

15:15.940 --> 15:17.300
I was just really worried.

15:17.300 --> 15:21.100
I, you know, with all, I don't, I don't know, you know, you got to protect your property

15:21.100 --> 15:22.100
and whatnot.

15:22.100 --> 15:28.600
I understand, but I need you to understand what you did is a high crime here.

15:28.600 --> 15:29.600
High crime?

15:29.600 --> 15:30.600
High crime.

15:30.600 --> 15:31.600
High crime?

15:31.600 --> 15:32.600
Oh Jesus.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.780
But you know, I, I came without warning.

15:34.780 --> 15:37.660
So you know, I think I get what I get at this point.

15:37.660 --> 15:41.700
The Maggie, Maggie cook sent me to look or have a look around here.

15:41.700 --> 15:43.580
Oh, why is that officer?

15:43.580 --> 15:47.900
Oh, you know, just, it's part of a part of the investigation.

15:47.900 --> 15:51.100
You're not in trouble or anything, but this has to do with the body at the junkyard.

15:51.100 --> 15:55.820
I didn't say that, but well, I mean, George, George is headed out with Leo down to the

15:55.820 --> 15:56.820
police station.

15:56.820 --> 16:01.980
So I would assume that you stayed behind to what now?

16:01.980 --> 16:09.780
Well, just to make sure nothing, there was no trouble you trying to live up to that family

16:09.780 --> 16:10.780
name of yours.

16:10.780 --> 16:15.700
I guess I knew that I didn't think anyone was home, so I was just going to do a quick

16:15.700 --> 16:18.860
search of the perimeter, make sure nothing was up and I was going to get, get back to

16:18.860 --> 16:19.860
the station.

16:19.860 --> 16:22.340
Did you have a, did you have a warrant for that?

16:22.340 --> 16:28.460
Yeah, but, uh, I've dropped it as soon as you shot me cause it scared me so bad.

16:28.460 --> 16:36.420
Uh, you're going to roll persuade against her human.

16:36.420 --> 16:38.620
That's a 50 on a 70 for me.

16:38.620 --> 16:39.620
Okay.

16:39.620 --> 16:40.620
And she failed.

16:40.620 --> 16:46.880
So, uh, and for the listeners, human is human intelligence and it would be like deciphering

16:46.880 --> 16:50.360
human emotions through action and voice.

16:50.360 --> 16:51.960
She uh, she buys it.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.360
Oh, oh shoot.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.360
Okay.

16:54.360 --> 16:55.360
Uh, well fuck.

16:55.360 --> 16:56.360
I am.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.360
Oh boy.

16:57.360 --> 16:58.360
Okay.

16:58.360 --> 17:05.680
Well, you know, Keith, I knew your parents and you know, I, I, I'd really appreciate

17:05.680 --> 17:07.120
you letting this one slide.

17:07.120 --> 17:09.720
I think, I think we, I think we're on the same page here.

17:09.720 --> 17:13.480
You know, I think if you just, if you put on a cup of coffee for me and let me just

17:13.480 --> 17:16.200
take a look around, we'll forget that this ever happened.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.200
Sounds good.

17:17.200 --> 17:22.520
Uh, so she goes back and as she's walking back to the kitchen to put on a pot of coffee,

17:22.520 --> 17:24.880
her phone starts doing the alarm.

17:24.880 --> 17:33.520
That's like the, that, that annoying alarm from the atomic meltdown.

17:33.520 --> 17:38.240
And she hollers from the other room, Hey, um, I've, I've actually got some, some coffee

17:38.240 --> 17:39.240
back here.

17:39.240 --> 17:40.240
That's ready to go.

17:40.240 --> 17:41.240
Do you like iced coffee?

17:41.240 --> 17:42.880
Not really, but I'll drink it.

17:42.880 --> 17:43.880
I guess.

17:43.880 --> 17:44.880
Okay.

17:44.880 --> 17:45.880
That's, that's perfect.

17:46.560 --> 17:50.280
I'll be back fairly quick with a plastic cup with iced coffee in it.

17:50.280 --> 17:54.320
That's so you can take it to go and kind of looked at you.

17:54.320 --> 17:58.840
Well, uh, that's awful nice of you, but I will be sticking around for a minute, uh,

17:58.840 --> 18:00.280
to take, take a little peek around.

18:00.280 --> 18:04.520
If you got something to do, feel free to go do that and I'll lock up behind you, but I'll

18:04.520 --> 18:06.520
be here for a minute.

18:06.520 --> 18:07.640
Oh, okay.

18:07.640 --> 18:11.040
And I glanced down at my foot and then glanced back.

18:11.040 --> 18:12.040
Yeah.

18:12.080 --> 18:17.320
And she's like, uh, okay, uh, I'm, I'm gonna be right back then.

18:17.320 --> 18:18.320
Okay.

18:18.320 --> 18:19.320
Take your time.

18:19.320 --> 18:20.320
She, uh, pops out the back door.

18:20.320 --> 18:21.320
Okay.

18:21.320 --> 18:22.320
Fuck yeah.

18:22.320 --> 18:23.320
Free range.

18:23.320 --> 18:26.320
I think I'm going to just do some snooping in this main house real quick.

18:26.320 --> 18:27.320
Okay.

18:27.320 --> 18:28.320
What are you looking for?

18:28.320 --> 18:29.320
I don't know.

18:29.320 --> 18:34.880
Particularly like anything that just doesn't seem like the pistons would have like, I know

18:34.880 --> 18:37.580
in my mind who these people probably are, right.

18:37.580 --> 18:42.300
Anything that pops out, out of the ordinary, I'm going to be digging through, not digging

18:42.300 --> 18:45.620
through drawers, but open drawers up, looking through that and just kind of searching this

18:45.620 --> 18:47.260
main house at first.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.260
Gotcha.

18:48.260 --> 18:49.260
Okay.

18:49.260 --> 18:51.300
So this main house is like I said before, it's, it's fairly well kept.

18:51.300 --> 18:55.100
It's pretty clear after snooping around for a while that this is where Kathy and George

18:55.100 --> 18:56.100
live.

18:56.100 --> 18:58.220
And they have an extra bedroom.

18:58.220 --> 19:02.440
That's a guest bedroom that is completely neat and unused.

19:02.440 --> 19:08.560
There's another room in the farmhouse as well that it is filled with Mary Kay stuff.

19:08.560 --> 19:09.560
Okay.

19:09.560 --> 19:10.560
Yeah.

19:10.560 --> 19:13.640
And you would know Kathy, which is this woman, Kathy Piston.

19:13.640 --> 19:14.640
She's a Mary Kay.

19:14.640 --> 19:15.640
That's her side hustle.

19:15.640 --> 19:16.640
Yeah, absolutely.

19:16.640 --> 19:23.920
And she's like very into it and wears kind of an absurd amount of makeup for a pig farmer.

19:23.920 --> 19:24.920
Right.

19:24.920 --> 19:25.920
Okay.

19:25.920 --> 19:30.480
So if I don't find anything of interest in there, I'm going to go over to the small farmhouse,

19:30.480 --> 19:31.800
which I assume is Leo's.

19:31.800 --> 19:32.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:32.840 --> 19:38.400
It's where his, uh, his old beat up truck is parked as you, uh, go ahead and roll alertness

19:38.400 --> 19:43.120
for me 92 on a 60 nice.

19:43.120 --> 19:53.440
As you are going to the small farmhouse, you see the door on the big warehouse shut.

19:53.440 --> 19:58.200
There's no one standing around there and you just see the door shut and you walk into the

19:58.200 --> 19:59.900
small farmhouse.

19:59.900 --> 20:03.380
This is Leo's place and it is quite different.

20:03.380 --> 20:05.140
It is a shithole.

20:05.140 --> 20:06.140
Filthy.

20:06.140 --> 20:07.140
It's gross.

20:07.140 --> 20:13.340
He works with the pigs all day and he does not take off his shoes when he gets home.

20:13.340 --> 20:14.340
Gotcha.

20:14.340 --> 20:18.300
So there's pig shit inside this place like casually look around.

20:18.300 --> 20:21.100
I'm not going to investigate too bad in here cause I don't want to be in here.

20:21.100 --> 20:22.100
Yeah.

20:22.100 --> 20:23.100
It smells fucking awful.

20:23.100 --> 20:25.060
There's like rancid food in the kitchen.

20:25.060 --> 20:26.380
Is it just one story?

20:26.380 --> 20:28.100
It is one bedroom.

20:28.100 --> 20:30.620
The bathroom and the kitchen are like one thing together.

20:30.620 --> 20:34.820
I'm going to glance around real quick and see if I find anything.

20:34.820 --> 20:36.180
Go ahead and roll search for me.

20:36.180 --> 20:37.180
Nope.

20:37.180 --> 20:38.380
46 on a 40.

20:38.380 --> 20:39.380
Pig shit.

20:39.380 --> 20:40.380
Pig shit for days.

20:40.380 --> 20:42.140
I get out of there like ASAP and then I want to go.

20:42.140 --> 20:50.120
You said there's the warehouse and then a, like a shed or, uh, there's a barn and a warehouse.

20:50.120 --> 20:51.120
That's it.

20:51.120 --> 20:52.120
Yeah.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.120
Yeah.

20:53.120 --> 20:54.900
Um, since I saw the warehouse door closed, I'm going to go to the barn first and leave

20:54.900 --> 20:56.900
the warehouse to be my last place.

20:56.900 --> 20:57.900
Okay.

20:58.100 --> 21:02.980
So you would go and open up the barn door.

21:02.980 --> 21:05.880
It's two big swinging doors right in front of it.

21:05.880 --> 21:11.100
And inside is just bales of hay, a couple of horses.

21:11.100 --> 21:12.100
This is like the stables basically.

21:12.100 --> 21:14.100
I'm going to go pet one of the horses.

21:14.100 --> 21:15.100
Cool.

21:15.100 --> 21:16.100
It's chill.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.100
Cool.

21:17.100 --> 21:19.380
Uh, I want to glance around, kind of poke around a little bit.

21:19.380 --> 21:22.460
See if there's any, this seems like a good place to hide something.

21:22.460 --> 21:23.460
So sure.

21:23.460 --> 21:24.460
Sure.

21:24.460 --> 21:25.460
Sure.

21:25.460 --> 21:26.460
Go ahead and roll search for me again.

21:26.460 --> 21:27.460
Shit.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.520
75 on 40.

21:30.520 --> 21:31.520
Killing it.

21:31.520 --> 21:32.980
I'm doing some Vigna style police work.

21:32.980 --> 21:35.800
This is some Vigna police work.

21:35.800 --> 21:39.500
You look around and there seems to be nothing out of place.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.940
This is a normal barn.

21:40.940 --> 21:44.700
Wait, did you say the warehouse has the, the buses by it?

21:44.700 --> 21:45.700
Yes.

21:45.700 --> 21:50.180
I want to go sneak into one of the buses and post up and see if I see anybody coming out

21:50.180 --> 21:51.180
of the warehouse.

21:51.180 --> 21:53.180
Okay, cool.

21:53.180 --> 21:54.180
Okay.

21:54.220 --> 21:58.300
Where are you going in inside this bus and which bus are you going to?

21:58.300 --> 22:02.460
I'm going to the bus that's closest to the door that I saw close.

22:02.460 --> 22:03.460
Okay.

22:03.460 --> 22:06.700
And I'm going to just get in there to where like I can just pop down if I see somebody

22:06.700 --> 22:07.700
and hide.

22:07.700 --> 22:08.700
Okay.

22:08.700 --> 22:09.700
Sounds good.

22:09.700 --> 22:14.540
You're kind of looking out the window, uh, in one of the back seats of the bus and you're

22:14.540 --> 22:20.060
looking at that door and the door opens and Kathy pops her head out and is scanning.

22:20.060 --> 22:21.060
You roll luck.

22:21.060 --> 22:22.060
Oh.

22:22.940 --> 22:24.940
49 on a 60.

22:24.940 --> 22:25.940
Okay.

22:25.940 --> 22:30.740
So she kind of scans over to where you're at and you pop your head down just in time.

22:30.740 --> 22:38.660
And then as you pop your head back up, she comes out the door with a line of people.

22:38.660 --> 22:46.660
So many fucking people start piling out of this warehouse and she gets on the bus.

22:46.660 --> 22:47.660
My bus?

22:47.660 --> 22:49.460
The bus that you're in the back of.

22:49.460 --> 22:51.400
And she sits in the driver's seat.

22:51.840 --> 22:55.040
And I'm immediately, I'm popping down behind that back seat.

22:55.040 --> 23:01.060
The bus begins filling up with people and you hear voices and it's all muffled and they're

23:01.060 --> 23:03.280
all chitter chattering together.

23:03.280 --> 23:07.540
And it starts to smell really bad on this bus.

23:07.540 --> 23:10.880
And it's not that pig smell from Leo's farmhouse.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.360
It's a different kind of smell.

23:12.360 --> 23:20.360
It's the, it's the odor of the homeless population who is now residing on this school bus.

23:20.360 --> 23:26.600
There are as many people as can fit on a normal sized yellow school bus plus some.

23:26.600 --> 23:29.600
Are you looking up how many people can fit on a school bus?

23:29.600 --> 23:31.800
God, how many rows are there in a school bus?

23:31.800 --> 23:32.800
Okay.

23:32.800 --> 23:33.800
How many people does a school bus?

23:33.800 --> 23:34.800
It's 72 passengers.

23:34.800 --> 23:35.800
Okay.

23:35.800 --> 23:41.520
So there are a hundred people on this school bus and they are not paying any attention

23:41.520 --> 23:44.600
to you, but they are so close to you.

23:44.600 --> 23:48.640
You're like crouched behind this back seat and they are smashed.

23:48.640 --> 23:55.240
Three people per bench and then everyone like standing throughout the entire row and

23:55.240 --> 23:56.720
the bus begins to move.

23:56.720 --> 23:57.720
What do you do?

23:57.720 --> 23:58.720
Fuck.

23:58.720 --> 24:04.160
I'm so fucking glad this is happening.

24:04.160 --> 24:12.040
I, um, well shit, I'm going to open up the back door and I hope to God the alarm doesn't

24:12.040 --> 24:13.040
go off.

24:13.040 --> 24:14.600
The emergency door in the back.

24:14.600 --> 24:15.600
Fuck yeah.

24:15.600 --> 24:16.600
Okay.

24:16.840 --> 24:27.160
Roll luck for me cause we're just going to see, so yeah, so you, okay, here's what happens.

24:27.160 --> 24:34.120
You reach over and you grab the, the handle of the door in the back and as you open it,

24:34.120 --> 24:38.160
the door immediately opens and alarm starts sounding.

24:38.160 --> 24:43.760
It's going and you fall out the back of the door.

24:43.760 --> 24:48.320
Go ahead and roll athletics to see how well you take this fall.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.520
I got a fucking 99.

24:51.520 --> 24:56.200
Hell yeah dude.

24:56.200 --> 24:59.520
Um, okay.

24:59.520 --> 25:00.520
Okay.

25:00.520 --> 25:02.520
A critical fail.

25:02.520 --> 25:03.520
It's a critical fail.

25:03.520 --> 25:09.640
Uh, so you're going to roll a, we're going to double a d four cause I was going to make

25:09.640 --> 25:11.360
it a d four for falling out.

25:11.360 --> 25:16.400
Double a d four, two, like one times two, one times two.

25:16.400 --> 25:22.240
Uh, you take two damage, you fall and you fall on the exact same foot that got shot

25:22.240 --> 25:24.660
earlier and your ankle rolls.

25:24.660 --> 25:29.840
And so now it is like almost impossible to use that foot and put weight on it.

25:29.840 --> 25:36.120
But as you fall out, the door slams back closed and you hear the alarm stop ringing as it

25:36.120 --> 25:43.100
slams shut and the bus peels out on the County road and drives away, leaving you sitting

25:43.100 --> 25:49.480
in the middle of the road, which is not actually the main drive that you were on earlier.

25:49.480 --> 25:52.560
It's this back way that you didn't even notice before.

25:52.560 --> 25:57.480
So you were actually probably half a mile from the warehouse, which is on the far south

25:57.480 --> 25:58.920
part of the property.

25:58.920 --> 26:00.920
What's my movement speed at this point.

26:00.920 --> 26:05.040
If I wanted to go back to that warehouse, you can hop on one foot.

26:05.960 --> 26:10.880
Well, I mean, I'm on the opposite side of where my car is anyway, so I'm gonna hop back

26:10.880 --> 26:12.280
to that warehouse.

26:12.280 --> 26:13.280
Okay.

26:13.280 --> 26:20.400
You hop and you're not like the most elegant man on earth.

26:20.400 --> 26:27.000
And so you multiple times fall over on your way there, but you make it to the warehouse.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
What do you want to do?

26:28.000 --> 26:29.480
I want to see what's in this.

26:29.480 --> 26:31.080
Oh God.

26:31.080 --> 26:33.280
So you open up the door and

26:33.320 --> 26:34.320
Flashlight on.

26:34.320 --> 26:35.320
Flashlight on.

26:35.320 --> 26:41.040
It's dark in there, but there's a lot of windows on the top of the building and probably some

26:41.040 --> 26:42.360
like sunroofing.

26:42.360 --> 26:43.700
This is where all the pigs are.

26:43.700 --> 26:45.320
It's an indoor operation.

26:45.320 --> 26:49.800
And so inside the warehouse is this massive pig farming operation.

26:49.800 --> 26:53.880
There are hundreds of pigs separated into different sections of the warehouse and what

26:53.880 --> 26:58.780
looks to be an irrigation system running just above the head of an average man that sprays

26:58.780 --> 27:02.080
cool water down into the pins every once in a while.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.080
Only pigs in here, right?

27:03.080 --> 27:04.080
Yeah.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.480
There's just a bunch of pigs and it smells like pig shit.

27:06.480 --> 27:10.000
Are there any sleeping bags or anything like that or were these people, do I think these

27:10.000 --> 27:14.320
homeless people were there just like for a short amount of time or do you have absolutely

27:14.320 --> 27:19.440
no idea how that many people fit in here with all these pigs?

27:19.440 --> 27:23.400
Because the rows in between the pig pins are very thin.

27:23.400 --> 27:26.920
Well, not very thin, but like one person, right?

27:26.920 --> 27:29.200
Two people, not, you know?

27:29.200 --> 27:30.200
Yeah.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.200
Okay.

27:31.320 --> 27:35.200
They would have had to just been standing there for that many people to be in there.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.360
I want to do a search roll just to see if I...

27:37.360 --> 27:38.800
Go ahead and roll a search.

27:38.800 --> 27:39.800
No.

27:39.800 --> 27:40.800
80.

27:40.800 --> 27:41.800
80?

27:41.800 --> 27:42.800
Okay.

27:42.800 --> 27:43.800
So you hop around.

27:43.800 --> 27:46.480
You can use the pins at this point to get around easier.

27:46.480 --> 27:47.480
You don't find anything.

27:47.480 --> 27:48.480
Okay.

27:48.480 --> 27:49.480
I'm going to hop back to...

27:49.480 --> 27:50.480
Oh, hey.

27:50.480 --> 27:55.040
Quick reminder, you can burn luck to make any of these rolls a success.

27:55.040 --> 28:00.400
We haven't done that yet in this campaign so far because we've never actually used this

28:00.400 --> 28:03.200
luck mechanic in our home games before.

28:03.200 --> 28:06.720
And so we all keep forgetting about it, but yeah, you can always spend luck.

28:06.720 --> 28:09.520
Wish I would have known about that five minutes ago.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.520
When a lot of bad stuff happened.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.200
Yeah, I forgot about it too.

28:13.200 --> 28:16.160
Well, I guess I'm going to hop back.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.760
I want to hop back to the house real quick.

28:18.760 --> 28:19.760
Okay.

28:19.760 --> 28:25.320
As you're hopping back to the house, you get a call on your radio, which is attached to

28:25.320 --> 28:27.060
you on your person.

28:27.060 --> 28:28.600
And it is Clark.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.160
We got a situation down here, guys.

28:30.920 --> 28:31.920
Oh, shit.

28:31.920 --> 28:32.920
Fuck.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.080
We got a wreck in the parking lot.

28:35.080 --> 28:38.120
There's a guy who's just taken off gun in hand.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.480
Leo's in a black SUV.

28:39.480 --> 28:41.160
I didn't catch the damn plate.

28:41.160 --> 28:43.160
I need some help down here, guys.

28:50.160 --> 28:54.240
Okay, so you are heading to the hospital in the city to meet Julie Maxwell?

28:54.240 --> 28:55.240
Yes.

28:55.240 --> 28:59.520
John Lee Pettymore arrives at the hospital in the city, and as you are walking through

28:59.560 --> 29:04.680
the parking lot to the entrance of the large building, a man jumps out at you from in between

29:04.680 --> 29:05.680
two parked cars.

29:05.680 --> 29:07.680
I immediately draw him again and fire.

29:15.680 --> 29:16.680
Roll firearms.

29:16.680 --> 29:18.680
Oh, we're doing this.

29:20.680 --> 29:22.680
No, he's not involved in this.

29:22.680 --> 29:25.680
I don't want to do the paperwork.

29:25.840 --> 29:29.840
Okay, but you would probably get a hand on the gun real quick.

29:29.840 --> 29:32.840
Yeah, I reached for the handle of my pistol.

29:32.840 --> 29:38.840
He's this like weird hunched dude wearing an old tattered robe with a hood that's covering

29:38.840 --> 29:42.840
his face, and he says, Oogie boogie there, my friend.

29:42.840 --> 29:45.680
I know what you are.

29:45.680 --> 29:48.960
I know where you're from.

29:48.960 --> 29:54.320
He cackles and he whispers, Say hello to me, would ya?

29:54.960 --> 30:00.960
As he hands you a folded up piece of paper, and he runs away into the darkness.

30:03.960 --> 30:05.960
Oh, there's a lot on this paper.

30:08.960 --> 30:10.960
Oh, shit.

30:10.960 --> 30:14.960
I immediately radio into the station that we're dealing with some kind of robot.

30:14.960 --> 30:23.960
The note he handed me is just a bunch of binary, looks to be maybe 20 or 30 words, all in binary,

30:24.600 --> 30:27.600
and then just in English.

30:29.600 --> 30:34.600
You know, as if my day wasn't already busy enough, I'm going to radio this in.

30:34.600 --> 30:40.600
I'm going to take a picture of this with my phone, send it to Randy and Andy.

30:40.600 --> 30:41.600
Drew.

30:41.600 --> 30:42.600
To Drew.

30:42.600 --> 30:47.600
And ask one of them to try to get a translation on that, and while I'm calling them, I also,

30:47.600 --> 30:53.600
I don't know if anybody else has done this yet, but those keys we found marked with G10

30:54.240 --> 30:56.240
through 12 or whatever it was.

30:56.240 --> 31:01.240
I want to get one of them just so we're doing the legwork of checking out local mini storages.

31:01.240 --> 31:05.240
Right, so those keys are in Clark Bishop's desk.

31:05.240 --> 31:11.240
Vigna threw them to him earlier when you guys were in the station, and Clark has them in

31:11.240 --> 31:12.240
his desk.

31:12.240 --> 31:14.240
Yeah, you can send that message on to Drew.

31:14.240 --> 31:17.600
Literally, I just need somebody doing the groundwork of like, hey, where is the storage

31:17.600 --> 31:20.600
within nearby that has G units?

31:20.600 --> 31:22.600
You could ask Tim to do it.

31:22.600 --> 31:23.600
G unit.

31:23.600 --> 31:24.600
Yeah.

31:24.600 --> 31:25.600
I'd do that.

31:25.600 --> 31:26.600
Okay, cool.

31:26.600 --> 31:27.600
So.

31:27.600 --> 31:28.600
Real quick.

31:28.600 --> 31:29.600
Who's Tim?

31:29.600 --> 31:35.600
Oh, Tim, the guy who works at the police station who does like everything.

31:35.600 --> 31:36.600
Ray?

31:36.600 --> 31:37.600
No.

31:37.600 --> 31:40.600
I just called him Randy, but I definitely thought we went with Ray.

31:40.600 --> 31:44.600
It's weird because you think his name is Ray, but.

31:44.600 --> 31:47.600
No, you're pretty sure it's Tim.

31:47.600 --> 31:49.600
I always liked Tim.

31:49.600 --> 31:50.600
I asked him to do that.

31:50.600 --> 31:51.600
Yeah, sounds good.

31:51.600 --> 31:57.240
Okay, so as you walk into the large hospital, you see a desk with a woman sitting behind

31:57.240 --> 32:01.200
it next to a large Christmas tree and a life-size nativity scene.

32:01.200 --> 32:02.200
What do you want to do?

32:02.200 --> 32:04.200
I'd like to see Julie Maxwell, please.

32:04.200 --> 32:07.600
Yeah, she lets you know that Julie Maxwell is in room 1030.

32:07.600 --> 32:12.600
I take the stairs because, you know, you don't want to be a lard ass.

32:12.600 --> 32:20.480
All right, so John Lee Pettymore, as you walk into room 1030, you see two beds, and one

32:20.480 --> 32:25.080
is an old man with mutton chops and large, thick eyebrows.

32:25.080 --> 32:28.480
I immediately hold out my hand and say, hello, Julie.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.160
Oh, what?

32:30.160 --> 32:32.080
The other bed is empty.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.960
My name's Doug.

32:33.960 --> 32:34.960
My apologies, sir.

32:34.960 --> 32:37.080
Have you seen a young woman?

32:37.080 --> 32:40.280
No, there was a- Any woman?

32:40.280 --> 32:43.440
There's like a middle-aged- Yeah, that sounds about right, giving her

32:43.440 --> 32:44.720
past and backstory.

32:44.720 --> 32:45.960
She was crazy.

32:45.960 --> 32:46.960
She was in here.

32:46.960 --> 32:48.400
I didn't like her one bit.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.600
I'm glad she's gone.

32:49.600 --> 32:50.600
Where is she now?

32:50.600 --> 32:54.200
She just got up, I don't know, about half an hour ago and left.

32:54.200 --> 32:55.440
Thank you for your time, Doug.

32:55.440 --> 33:03.200
I immediately head to security or wherever this place keeps their cameras and ask them

33:03.200 --> 33:05.080
to find out where Julie went.

33:05.080 --> 33:09.280
This would take a little time, but you would find out after looking through the cameras,

33:09.280 --> 33:16.320
you would see that she walked out the front door half an hour ago, gown open, just heading

33:16.320 --> 33:17.640
out into the world.

33:17.680 --> 33:28.040
Okay, I call the city PD and ask if anybody has brought in a gown-wearing crazy woman

33:28.040 --> 33:29.720
matching her description.

33:29.720 --> 33:32.280
Not today.

33:32.280 --> 33:35.360
The city's pretty rough and tumble.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.600
It's no place to raise a family.

33:37.600 --> 33:38.600
Absolutely not.

33:38.600 --> 33:43.320
I kind of explained what's going on and the pretty serious ... This is not just some random

33:43.320 --> 33:47.200
... This is a very important suspect in a murder case.

33:47.840 --> 33:54.840
So if I explain that, do I get any assistance or offers for a squad car to go look for or

33:54.840 --> 33:55.840
something?

33:55.840 --> 33:56.840
They're busy.

33:56.840 --> 33:57.840
You're a small-town cop.

33:57.840 --> 33:58.840
They don't give a fuck.

33:58.840 --> 34:02.640
If it's a murder case and we get a hold of her, then we'll let you know.

34:02.640 --> 34:03.640
Okay.

34:03.640 --> 34:04.640
Well, you have been no help.

34:04.640 --> 34:05.640
Thank you very much.

34:05.640 --> 34:06.640
Perfect.

34:06.640 --> 34:07.640
I hope no one else dies.

34:07.640 --> 34:17.120
How'd you feel if your whole family's faces were smashed or ripped?

34:18.040 --> 34:22.160
Okay, so I'm going to take off in my cruiser in the direction that she left and try to

34:22.160 --> 34:25.360
look for her, but I also have some other things I want to do while I'm in the city.

34:25.360 --> 34:31.840
I'd like to see how close I am to a camera store and how close I am to a dirty dog grooming.

34:31.840 --> 34:39.540
You're pretty close to a dirty dog grooming and there are five dirty dog grooming salons

34:39.540 --> 34:45.360
in the city and you are also probably pretty near a camera shop.

34:45.880 --> 34:50.640
Does John Peter's dirty dog loyalty card mention a specific location?

34:50.640 --> 34:51.640
No.

34:51.640 --> 34:53.520
Okay, so I'm going to head to the camera shop.

34:53.520 --> 34:55.800
You get a call.

34:55.800 --> 34:59.440
It is someone from the city police station.

34:59.440 --> 35:04.440
Yeah, I think we actually clocked your suspect in a gown.

35:04.440 --> 35:10.040
She seems to have just stolen a black SUV and is heading west on the highway.

35:10.040 --> 35:11.040
All right.

35:11.400 --> 35:15.200
Immediately, I think him and I kick my cruiser, like throw on my lights.

35:15.200 --> 35:18.200
I don't give a shit about jurisdiction.

35:18.200 --> 35:20.200
Hell yeah.

35:20.200 --> 35:23.400
I'm going to chase her.

35:23.400 --> 35:24.560
Yeah, I'm going to chase her down.

35:24.560 --> 35:25.560
Sounds good.

35:25.560 --> 35:26.560
She's heading for contention.

35:26.560 --> 35:31.960
She's heading for contention, the officer says.

35:31.960 --> 35:33.960
I know.

35:33.960 --> 35:36.760
I'm from there.

35:36.760 --> 35:39.960
You are going to roll drive for me.

35:40.880 --> 35:46.880
36 on a more than that, on a 50, no, 70.

35:46.880 --> 35:47.880
Okay, nice.

35:47.880 --> 35:53.200
So you speed back into town and you don't catch up with her on the highway because it

35:53.200 --> 35:55.360
seems she got a pretty good head start on you.

35:55.360 --> 36:01.040
Blind with anger and a thirst for justice and answers.

36:01.040 --> 36:02.680
The truth, really.

36:02.680 --> 36:09.920
John Lee Pettymore completely spaces the fourth, completely spaces that he should, he should

36:09.920 --> 36:13.360
definitely tell the town that this lady is coming.

36:13.360 --> 36:18.320
You were just eyes red, just fucking flying down the highway.

36:18.320 --> 36:19.800
You roll into contention.

36:19.800 --> 36:24.440
You drive straight down the main road, right down to the police station.

36:24.440 --> 36:32.200
And as you get there, I need you to roll me an alertness check.

36:32.200 --> 36:34.200
My luckier dice.

36:38.200 --> 36:39.200
14.

36:39.480 --> 36:41.080
Hell yeah.

36:41.080 --> 36:47.720
As you're driving down this main drag and pulling up to the police department, you see,

36:47.720 --> 36:51.720
well first your radio goes off and it's Clark Bishop.

36:51.720 --> 36:53.280
We got a situation down here guys.

36:53.280 --> 36:54.280
Come on.

36:54.280 --> 36:55.280
Uh, oh shit.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.280
Uh, fuck.

36:56.280 --> 36:58.160
Uh, we got a, we got a, uh, a wreck in the parking lot.

36:58.160 --> 37:01.240
There's a, uh, a guy's just taken off gun in hand.

37:01.240 --> 37:02.520
Leo's in a, in a black SUV.

37:02.520 --> 37:04.320
I didn't catch the damn plate.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.320
I need, I need some help down here guys.

37:06.320 --> 37:12.040
You actually see this black SUV driving east from the police station.

37:12.040 --> 37:19.080
You see Leo piston in the driver's seat of this SUV with a horrified look on his face.

37:19.080 --> 37:24.240
And you see the barrel of a pistol pressed firmly against the back of Leo piston's head.

37:24.240 --> 37:26.240
Go ahead and roll sanity for me.

37:26.240 --> 37:27.240
Okay.

37:27.240 --> 37:29.440
I passed 54 and a 59.

37:29.440 --> 37:30.440
Okay.

37:30.440 --> 37:31.440
So you lose no sanity.

37:31.440 --> 37:33.200
You were like ready to go.

37:33.200 --> 37:35.200
I'd peel out after him.

37:35.200 --> 37:36.200
Fuck yeah.

37:36.200 --> 37:53.080
I'm the only one trying to fool.

37:53.080 --> 38:16.960
How can you have enough drowning out all the notes.
