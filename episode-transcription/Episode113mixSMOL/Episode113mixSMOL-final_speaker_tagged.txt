0.00 67.04 speaker0  What's up everybody? It's Zach. I am Zach and I want to pop in here real quick before this, the finale of season one with a few announcements. First, this is the last episode.

155.84 188.56 speaker0  the Circle of Knowledge Shirt Club or a higher tier in the month of October,
183.20 202.00 speaker1  and I brought back some snacks from Korea for the boys to try, so join us for a super relaxed hang
194.08 226.08 speaker0  and a link to the playback will be available to all patrons. So, make it happen. And as Wolf says, all the links are in the show notes. Now, back to you, Wolfie. Wolfie, Wolfie.
217.52 459.44 speaker1  Join me in the barrel. Take a load off. Uh, wait, no, don't. Get hyped. Because you are tuned into the biggest, baddest radio station on this dimensions block. 694.2 PTBP. who did the most damnedest, gosh darn dirtiest, delicious, dutiful thing you can do. She wrote us a five-star review on Apple Podcasts. Hell yeah, dude. She writes, I would like to shout out my D&D group, who I hope will soon dive into the world of Delta Green with me. Shout out to my two amazing DMs, Zach and Nick. To my fellow player, Will, and to the love of my life, who I'm honored to roleplay in more than one way with Lucas. It's, uh, me is who. And my producer, somewhat, I guess. And now I want to let it be known, I have never been invited to a D&D group. Not a single time. And I still don't really know what the hell y'all are doing in these groups. And honestly, it freaks me the freak out. So I never ask. Y'all, when Instagram went down, a part of me rejoiced because finally all of y'all were living in Wolfie's world. The other part of me that is bound by my producer's contract is here to tell you to follow along and tag the show at pretending pod. There's even a handy link in the show notes news. Last time, Keith turned into Keith's and eliminated the threat of the wormy ceiling. Leaving my mind at your altar. Crossing the double line, doing it every time. Tell me what
456.80 498.80 speaker2  Because I was like, I don't know. In the only 30 seconds.
495.92 514.24 speaker0  Just one day out of the year really needed room noise.
508.96 569.36 speaker2  are being recorded. If any of you little fuckers have a problem with that, you speak up now. Yeah. Burns mustache. Almost a beard. I don't know. I would call it a beard.
566.24 582.96 speaker0  I disagree. You don't have a beard right now. It's a variety of beard. I like it though. This internet website claims that that style of facial hair is called Friendly Mutton Chops.
578.88 616.88 speaker2  Oh, I don't like that name at all. I do. I feel like mutton chops, once you've got chops, that's a beard, not just sideburns.
612.00 617.76 speaker0  Gentlemen, lamb chops. We'll have to take a group picture with the TV.
616.96 690.00 speaker2  Yes. That'll be fun. Oh, goodness. That's not... It's a little bit... It's more staccato though. There's bigger breaks. Did we nail it? That was great. like compilation of it. And then I saw that and I was like, oh yeah, that's fucking weird. But this is that. This is that episode.
688.96 692.08 speaker0  Is this 113?
690.00 703.68 speaker2  I bet we can drag this out for two or three more.
702.88 725.84 speaker0  For one season. I think I told you guys in the forties, mid forties. We've done a lot of stuff. It's also been a running thing that you would often say to us,
721.28 742.24 speaker2  That's also a running thing from our very first role-playing games together, where you're like, I think this will take an evening. And then it took a month. Oh yeah. but listening to it where it was like, yeah, this whole time, five days.
741.60 746.80 speaker0  Which thing? We did go back in time a couple times. That's true.
745.44 750.96 speaker2  It's more like a few hundred years.
747.52 754.24 speaker0  This one in particular makes sense for as far as five days ago.
752.32 772.08 speaker2  We relived that one afternoon. A lot. like we made Zach listen to one time at our home session.
768.08 785.54 speaker0  and before you even dove into the scenario at hall, you were like, our characters are probably hungry. And I wanted pancakes.
785.04 801.44 speaker2  No.
794.72 814.64 speaker0  And then we went through a full round of ordering breakfast foods and drinks where I just played your server. Did you like that?
812.24 843.76 speaker2  and I'm pretty pissed Luke said he didn't want to get it after this. because it's like right down the street from my work, and I'm sad every time I do. Are you getting dope waffles and eggs, No, I get breakfast food every time. Breakfast food. Breakfast food.
842.72 856.40 speaker1  Breakfast food?
855.12 886.24 speaker2  I'm a little bit sad. You get the blue mood. you got sweaty blood. Okay. I know, give me the fucking hash browns.
885.84 887.92 speaker0  Luke?
886.24 891.52 speaker2  Smothered, covered, capped. Smothered, covered. Scattered, covered, smothered. What, scattered?
891.04 900.80 speaker0  Crispy. Where it's all crispy, yeah. So I think that's a holdover, because you can ask for ring also.
898.80 909.44 speaker2  No, it specifically says scattered like crispy.
905.92 918.24 speaker0  I like the crisp on top and I like that little mushy underneath.
915.20 935.76 speaker2  Justin, do you have a Waffle House hash brown order? because I'm a monster. and get all that yolk up in the hash browns. There's your problem, dude.
933.60 938.40 speaker0  You're not getting them scrambled cheesy eggs.
935.76 943.92 speaker2  I'm a big mix all your food together type of guy. Hard saying.
939.44 953.84 speaker0  Yeah, my eggs go right on top of those hash browns as soon as it arrives. Flop them. Flop them on top.
950.72 1012.16 speaker2  I ordered a half pound Larry Burger, which is- That's the one to get. It was packed in there. I had to like sit at the bar at a- Well, I was sitting right next to the touch tunes thing, which is super fucking annoying, because there was a bunch of drunk people in there at- This is lunch? This is 1230. Oh, it's W.F. Cody's. Yeah. so that they could play their touch tunes next. Anyway, she brings out the full pound burger and I'm like, I didn't order that. And she's like, oh, sorry. I just rang it in wrong. Did you want to eat all this meat? And she's like, just eat it. I ate the whole fucking thing and I felt like shit all the rest of the day. Yeah, dude. Half a pound is like too big. Half a pound is a lot, man. I ate a whole one pound burger and most of the fries that came with it.
1010.40 1016.16 speaker0  Well, I guess it's a double quarter pounder.
1013.76 1029.04 speaker2  I ate a quadruple quarter pounder. Yeah.
1025.84 1039.92 speaker0  At 1230 in the afternoon. We went in and like, they just sang me happy birthday and we did the whole thing and they brought shots out for us. Well, you just said you were 21.
1038.40 1043.92 speaker2  We could probably go do that now.
1043.52 1048.48 speaker0  You? Sure. Yeah. Whatever. As long as you're singing happy birthday.
1046.72 1052.48 speaker2  I mean, if anybody's turning 21, it's me. Yeah, it would be Lukey.
1049.60 1055.36 speaker0  And I would say just give me a full one pound burger.
1053.84 1060.80 speaker2  I'm down to eat two pounds of meat today. Two pounds of burger today.
1056.72 1067.84 speaker0  Okay, so we've got you guys in this realm that you've been in. I think that was good for an episode. Okay, yeah, let's wrap it here. Let's 113.
1066.08 1071.84 speaker2  It'll be a couple of weeks before 114.
1070.96 1083.20 speaker0  That sounds good.
1080.72 1087.52 speaker2  And then we'll do the finale. The actual finale. Well, no, no, no.
1084.64 1100.88 speaker3  What I think we should do is this should just be the finale. Oh, that's fun.
1099.76 1122.72 speaker2  That's a lot of fun.
1121.52 1131.92 speaker0  I feel God. In this waffle house.
1127.60 1136.32 speaker2  I'm going to be an asshole and say, I got to, let me just piss before we actually
1135.76 1218.96 speaker0  It's been hot. but there was so much going on, so much stress, so much noise, so many threats challenging what the rest of your lives, your existence will be. Not only your existence, but the existence of everyone you've ever known. And not only the individuals that you've come into contact with, but every version of those individuals and every version of yourselves. That's all been at risk until now. The voices of the Keiths ring out almost infinitely. Okay. Now it brought the Oreo McFlurry in the first place. these creatures?
1213.04 1260.32 speaker2  As a myriad was popping in, they were popping in in the form of Keith. Keith, who was in the body of the myriad that he had switched into within seconds, minutes, had switched forms. Right. Oh, no. Yeah. Yes. The only Keith without a McFlurry is myriad Keith, and Keiths are keeping an eye on it.
1257.12 1274.48 speaker0  As he was copping about trying to get used to his body, Keith in the body of myriad just slides by and lifts the McFlurry out of his hand. Oh, yeah.
1267.84 1283.44 speaker2  Well, as soon as myriad Keiths took the McFlurry out of Keith, then every myriad Keith had a McFlurry in there.
1282.16 1288.32 speaker0  What are the Keiths wearing?
1287.44 1289.20 speaker2  I just did.
1288.32 1291.60 speaker0  Police uniform. Pants are too big. Big old bridges.
1290.72 1388.56 speaker2  Big old bridges. Well, most of them are wearing that. Some of them are wearing too tight polo with way too big cargo shorts. Some are wearing the other things that Keith has worn throughout. Some of the Keiths look at some of the new ones popping in and they're like, that's a really complicated shirt. And literally by the second, there's 10, 20, 40, 1,000, 10,000 Keiths popping in. But the one Keith without the McFlurry is copping around. And main Keith sits him down on the ground. And Keith is like pointing his two fingers at his eyes. Yeah.
1383.60 1402.88 speaker0  with overclocking this Clark Bishop that has become the overseer. And you also see Clark Bishop standing nearby. You see Planet Juggernaut who is being topped by... That's not what I meant.
1401.36 1421.84 speaker3  Did you mean perhaps mounted? Mounted. Yeah, ridden hard by...
1418.88 1434.80 speaker0  and just wondrous collection of colors. Some of which the human eye, your specific human eyes have never been able to comprehend before are twisted in. You know what?
1434.00 1439.94 speaker2  Oh, I love that.
1439.44 1467.76 speaker0  Yeah. Topping his head. The only people who are here who are not chanting, the bodies of both Drew Pages... Fuck me. Drew Pages and Carrie... Drew Andrews and Carrie Pages.
1465.68 1488.40 speaker2  because he's seeing lots of different kinds of Keiths. He's seeing fancy Keiths, expensive shirt Keiths. He's seeing big pants Keiths. And he's like, sits down, closes his eyes. All of a sudden there's only one Keith. Cool. Nice.
1485.52 1490.56 speaker0  Well, so the John sacrificed itself.
1490.08 1497.76 speaker3  Yeah. So that ball is torched. I think you're released. Yeah.
1493.36 1506.40 speaker0  Don is his own man now, once again.
1505.04 1513.20 speaker3  Has that happened before?
1511.20 1519.44 speaker0  Like a bad marshmallow.
1517.84 1520.16 speaker2  That's what the whole deal looks like.
1520.00 1570.96 speaker3  Yeah. That's what I was imagining because as the huge legs, I was wondering if it just like... Yeah. Yes. Don is like absolutely exhausted and kind of like on his hands and knees on the ground after using all of his, as much magic as he's ever used in that short amount of time in his entire life. Just emotionally overwhelmed by everything. I think he's kind of taken a breather in this second after just the complete,
1570.08 1579.52 speaker2  There's something.
1576.64 1583.28 speaker0  If you want a wand, you get your magic John wand.
1581.20 1595.12 speaker3  but it doesn't mean it's just like always good when we sing.
1589.84 1610.24 speaker0  If you had a John ever magic John one, if you want to John have your magic John one.
1608.00 1626.48 speaker2  He's hearing the magic John one song. Amongst every other song that we've ever sang. Yeah, key that up now Zach. Fuck you.
1621.44 1653.60 speaker3  Can Don in fact feel like the presence of John in this? Nailed it. I think Don clutches it close to his chest kind of as he's like crumpled over a little bit with like the little embers still burning a little bit from the wand. Drew!
1652.40 1667.84 speaker2  Can't you just look at him? He's not grown accustomed to. It's been literally seconds or minutes since he's been in this.
1664.72 1682.40 speaker0  The body of Kerry pages runs up to you and is like, hello. Hello, sir. Oh my God. It is so good to see. And they'll shut up.
1679.12 1690.16 speaker2  different planes of reality and it's really fucking him up. And he points at the radio.
1689.52 1692.80 speaker1  Get Kerry.
1691.04 1706.08 speaker0  Councilwoman Kerry pages here. And if you are willing to make. Shut up.
1703.52 1710.88 speaker2  Pushes the two together and flips the switch. How are you powering it?
1709.28 1772.40 speaker0  So it needs some ooze inside. But they put the ooze just in enough to where the light flips. Turns green. Green light lit on this radio. A bright flash lights up and you see shadows of each of you in the endless horizon. And because there's nothing to stop the light really for an almost indeterminate amount of space away from you, your shadows all light up and look enormous. Surrounding this place. It's me and I'm inside me.
1770.96 1778.16 speaker3  And he's smiling big.
1777.52 1789.76 speaker0  We did it.
1788.64 1794.80 speaker2  I know, bud. Look at you.
1793.12 1842.08 speaker0  Oh, you did so good. Oh my God. Drew Thulu. Thank you so much. Officer Bishop, you have, and she's crying and you hear through this darkness, these licks, these. Oh Tyler. You're so good. Oh my goodness. I put a hand on her shoulder.
1840.56 1848.72 speaker3  I told you I'd find him. Oh, thank you.
1848.40 1878.48 speaker0  Okay. So if we're here, are we here forever? Do we set up? What's first a post office?
1876.72 1886.56 speaker2  Like looks like he's in pain.
1883.20 1895.54 speaker3  and I think he can probably navigate better than I can. I think we can set things right at this point.
1895.04 1897.28 speaker0  Yeah.
1896.80 1905.84 speaker3  Close enough. Close enough, Drew.
1904.64 1909.20 speaker0  No, that was actually great. Because of the beans.
1908.16 1911.04 speaker3  You like that one? That's really good.
1909.84 1939.52 speaker0  Those are the only two I have. God, it's good to see you again. And Overseer gives him a hug. His face is just poking through and between their shoulders and looking up to this muck John. Who slips a tentacle of who's in there and like pats his back.
1936.24 1947.84 speaker3  You ended up going to Maggie's and he looks angry for a second. Yeah. And then he smiles. It brought us here though, I guess.
1946.64 1983.84 speaker0  All's well that ends well. A lot of responsibility. The meetings.
1983.52 1986.16 speaker3  Why? Why?
1985.12 1999.28 speaker0  This can be our home.
1996.88 2032.80 speaker2  I just don't want to hear all of this anymore.
2032.48 2034.80 speaker3  Wow.
2034.00 2044.80 speaker0  You're really laying them down.
2043.84 2060.72 speaker2  Where do we want to go? We can do anything. We being me, but also we being us.
2059.28 2130.48 speaker3  we, we want. And he turns to younger Clark. I'm, uh, I'm not, I'm not sure that you can, I think, uh, I think you need to do the things that I did because that's how I ended up here. Somebody, somebody has to be the overseer when this all happens. It's, uh, it's not, uh, it's not ideal, but, uh, as he's saying all this to Clark, there's not a single thing in his face that gives away anything. He is smiling broad and big. I, I, I, I'm the, I, I win. I'm the, I'm the savior. I'm the, I'm the guy who does everything. I, it's, I become you and then you work with me in the future and cool. Send me where you need me to. Just, just shoot me away. I'm good. I'm I've got plans. I know I need to run and to tell Drew something sometime. I'll, I'll write them down. I'll write down all the notes. I got it. I got it. Just shoot me on.
2129.04 2150.40 speaker1  I'm ready to go.
2149.20 2190.56 speaker3  It looks good on you though. It's a, it's a long, long, long road, but I got you set up over in that tower over there. You should be, you should be, have all the things you need there. That's kind of your home base. That's where I set up. It's a, it's up to you now. Cool. Right on. I'll, I'll, uh, you guys, uh, Hey, it was great working with you guys. Uh, I'm glad, I'm, I'm glad it ended up the way it did. Uh, Keith, uh, congratulations on your new found powers and John. And it's been the ride of a lifetime or several.
2189.52 2191.28 speaker2  Is this it Clark?
2190.56 2233.60 speaker3  That's it. Yeah. Afraid so. I mean, I'll see you guys a lot coming up. Uh, there's a lot of, a lot of looping and resetting and I, I kind of, I kind of twiddle my fingers in there. You guys remember, but I guess you won't know that it's me then. It's it's all right. I'm, I'm sure I'll get used to it.
2228.48 2280.96 speaker2  tear running down their face and Keith reaches his hand out to Clark. Two or three other Keith's come in and hug him too. little more like John. It's less the goo, the goo world, John, and he kind of manifests the John you knew on Right. But it's still mostly a goo body. But it looks like John Lee Pettymore the third.
2279.68 2283.52 speaker3  I haven't seen that face in a while. That's a, that's a good, that's a good.
2283.28 2362.88 speaker2  Yeah. Well, shut up, baby. I know. He hugs back, but he's just like heaving. You can't hear him crying, but he's just convulsing. are you gonna do? I'm of this world. lead. Will we, uh, will we see you again? Keith, you're, you're God. You'll see all of us whenever you want. Is there, is there anything I can do for you guys before I go? Is there anything you want?
2360.08 2373.60 speaker3  I think I might be in for a reward of some sort. Is that, can I ask you to, you kind of control reality now, right?
2373.36 2378.88 speaker2  Yeah.
2374.24 2412.72 speaker3  I think, I think you can, uh, you can, can you, can you slot me in somewhere where I'm a, I'm like a, like a detective from like those books or movies. I want to be a noir style detective somewhere. Sure.
2406.64 2423.12 speaker2  And Keith reaches out his hand to the overseer and three up and down handshake. And then he motions them to like, just like stand right beside it.
2418.88 2440.48 speaker3  And, uh, the overseer is going to do a, uh, something he's going to do a spell or something to send the liturgy. Uh, he wants to drop them doing their chance and send them back to where they are from.
2430.56 2443.60 speaker0  So as soon as the liturgy breaks and the chanting whispers have dissipated.
2442.96 2451.52 speaker3  Good show. Oh my God.
2450.80 2467.84 speaker0  Endlessly.
2467.28 2469.92 speaker2  bit.
2468.96 2498.24 speaker0  I can't do it. and gets real fistfuls of cloth, you know, on either side and just buries his face into your chest.
2496.88 2508.24 speaker3  Next name was Harry. I'm, I'm sorry. It's been, it's been a century since I've seen him. I'm sorry about that.
2505.12 2519.28 speaker0  He's mine and I can't do it without him. And he, uh, he looks up into your eyes with just plea.
2517.60 2541.28 speaker3  We, uh, I look over at Keith. Yeah, we can, we can, we can do that. That's, that's something I can do and he can do it together. We can make sure that for sure happens. He's easy.
2535.84 2560.96 speaker2  Hey, look, Keith reaches out with his hand and in his hand is a little tiny figurine
2559.20 2579.12 speaker3  just do that, right? Isn't that right?
2578.64 2593.52 speaker2  Yeah.
2587.44 2686.16 speaker0  lady arms around your neck from the back and she's trying to choke you out. in this dim, dim light of this world. It's just fucking key. Yeah. with her granddaughter till DB Mitchell. Keith looks at him.
2685.04 2707.70 speaker2  Same as the overseer. Same as anybody else here that doesn't want to go back to their, their plane.
2707.20 2737.28 speaker0  Jack. Jack Pearlman, Everett pace. Look at each other and also see Greer Hilfintop Kermunker now and a bartender and a piano player and a gambler named Thomas. They're all from the same time period and contention. They all recognize each other.
2734.56 2742.24 speaker1  Don't have to be back where I came from.
2739.20 2772.26 speaker3  I think, I think we can get you, get you set up any way you want. big old ranch with a big old herd of horses that need tendon to that I can take care of surrounded by beautiful nature, lakes, a seller full of good whiskey, couple of dogs to keep Keith speaks up.
2771.76 2779.52 speaker2  Jack.
2778.00 2811.04 speaker3  Everett comes toddling up. You think maybe I could have a, have a little shack out there on the edge of your property? I just want my shack.
2808.16 2820.24 speaker0  and squash the watermelons with my thighs. My name is Greer.
2817.76 2844.80 speaker2  Yeah, he just promised you watermelons, man.
2841.20 2850.56 speaker3  You're, you're, you're, you're part of our career as far as I'm concerned.
2850.16 2888.80 speaker0  set up. Sir, what's your name? Oh, my name's Sparkin. Sparkin? What do you want? I just love having a, having a bar to slide glass down, you know? it'll be a piano there for me to tickle the fun, tickle the, tickle the operates?
2887.20 2919.06 speaker2  Keith steps up on his back. Anything you want, I can give to you. If you come with me, gesture over to Clark. So, uh, make your decision. I guess I won't be mad. He won't be mad.
2918.56 2969.92 speaker0  Yeah. And in this case, we've got a raccoon, a chunk kitty, a distinguished gray dog and old chunky proud chipmunk. We've got Tyler, the excitable black lab, a friendly woodpecker, an old gray squirrel, a golden retriever. Bean is there as well. Salem, the cat's body has been mewing constantly at the radio, just pawing at the radio and mewing over and over Archie and taco joined the group as well. And that whole mess of fun time, content your contention, create a career coalition animals all swarm toward Keith Clark.
2969.12 2971.36 speaker2  on there.
2969.92 2990.24 speaker3  Please call me, call me overseer. I'm no, I'm no longer Clark.
2987.52 2994.10 speaker2  uh, overseer say what you must.
2993.60 3001.28 speaker3  Yeah. Everybody ready?
2999.36 3013.04 speaker0  The only two that I haven't mentioned yet. Also go and join the group that is standing over by the Keith's who's in a Clark slash
3009.60 3023.78 speaker3  I don't, I don't picture us dividing like that. Do you?
3023.28 3025.76 speaker0  Okay.
3024.56 3030.72 speaker2  Yeah, they're all this fucking eyes.
3026.24 3053.52 speaker0  I guess they all, I guess they went with God. Wait, what is that from? Everyone's coming to party in my house.
3050.24 3067.36 speaker2  I was thinking like, if you want to go back to your old life, go with him. If you want to follow a, uh, have you heard of Jesus, a Jesus like character? Come with me.
3063.44 3076.16 speaker3  Overseer has been in concert with you because I think that the deal is that the overseer is going to be able to help like create portals, but you're the one who's going to be able to create realities. Yeah.
3073.28 3077.92 speaker2  The Clark is staying here to wait his time in the tower.
3076.96 3092.40 speaker0  What's John doing?
3088.16 3118.88 speaker2  me and I plan on bringing some law to it. You want to ride the juggernaut across these cosmic planes with me?
3118.40 3146.64 speaker3  Hell yeah. he's like, let's bring some law to this lawless land. Yeah, fuck yeah.
3140.00 3163.92 speaker2  whose nephew like flings you up on top next to him and together you top planet juggernaut into the sunset. Yes.
3162.32 3169.76 speaker0  out into the sunset forever?
3169.28 3175.12 speaker3  to it. Oh my God.
3170.40 3242.56 speaker0  Well, before he quite leaves, let's go ahead and get our question in. They keep calling him Keith. What do you think about this fellow so far? us here of this very last treasurable time in our lives. What do you think about getting them here? The wildest versions of them that are- Oh, Dick Nichols. Is that you?
3240.96 3245.84 speaker1  Oh, yes.
3244.88 3253.20 speaker0  Poking out of skin?
3251.44 3255.04 speaker2  So you're like two-headed.
3253.20 3271.92 speaker0  Should we nuzzle our- Yes. Oh, nuzzle with me, brother.
3268.64 3292.08 speaker2  or something, you know, like all the classic movie villains. But then I realized they were actually queer coded, like all the classic movie villains.
3290.72 3312.64 speaker0  Oh, my goodness. Well, I personally think it's really nice to have the nickel nickels. There's all the four nickels, quad nickels, all together here, coming up right now. We're all walking up here, all playing and jogging on. Oh, my goodness.
3310.40 3334.80 speaker3  He's a round bound of something, I tell you. I want to work. Should we ask him if we could come with him? Hold on. He holds both his microphones out and walks directly towards them. Nick walks out.
3332.56 3345.52 speaker0  Mr. Juggernaut.
3341.04 3362.96 speaker2  And they stopped their dramatic mosey into the sunset. And John looks down. And he sees the nickels far below him. And there's this little Planet Juggernaut tendril right next to him in the shape of a hand with its finger out, given the just a minute hand gesture. What do you need, boys?
3362.32 3383.84 speaker1  Ask him, Nick. I bet you can do it. Oh, we believe you must do it.
3382.64 3396.16 speaker3  Ellie, talk about it.
3392.56 3423.44 speaker2  And the microphones are ripped out of your hands.
3417.44 3454.56 speaker0  assertively out toward Planet Juggernaut and Jon to say one final farewell. Jon sees it. He doesn't need... Oh, nay. Hold on, Planet Juggernaut.
3453.04 3457.52 speaker2  I never thought of it that way. Horses are rad.
3456.16 3468.16 speaker0  Horses are freaks, yeah. I know.
3467.28 3494.72 speaker2  So there is, like... But you just have a perfect just, like, cowboy saddle made out of the shifting, starry,
3493.52 3500.64 speaker0  Well, that was wonderful.
3498.72 3517.28 speaker2  He's sitting on the saddle, but there are no reins. He and Planet Juggernaut are pretty much as one. They're both ball. You can't see the tendril going from...
3516.32 3579.92 speaker0  But you're the horse. Nope. So Drew Andrews joins you on the plane. And also, some of those lessons were, like, But I think that you're, like, a really... I think you are always trying your best. And I really... I think that's cool.
3579.28 3604.00 speaker2  Adios.
3598.16 3645.12 speaker0  Yeah, I think that I have more to learn because I didn't know when you just said that. I don't know. You're gonna have to tell me again as we go. And Agent Trent Catt, the beautiful black cat that was once called Salem, but now is embodied by the spirit of Agent Trent Chad, is running around the ankles and rubbing against the ankles of Drew Andrews. And so Drew picks up this black cat and throws the cat up on his shoulders. And the cat kind of wraps himself around Drew's shoulders.
3644.64 3646.56 speaker2  Oh, okay. I'm kidding.
3645.92 3656.56 speaker0  Oh, okay.
3652.16 3661.44 speaker2  And I just can't, like, you know, they go out for a cheers with a beer bottle What?
3660.32 3664.16 speaker0  It makes you go out the top?
3664.16 3670.88 speaker2 
3670.40 3677.92 speaker0  Okay.
3677.44 3683.92 speaker3  Hold on.
3683.12 3703.44 speaker0  All right, great. Moving on. Oh, yeah.
3702.08 3717.36 speaker3  Some may ride with that boy.
3712.88 3742.56 speaker2  Keith pops the sun up so that they can ride into the sunset. And as they do, Keith takes special note of Planet Juggernaut's shape. Are you gonna be okay? Is there anything you need or want from me?
3740.72 3770.24 speaker3  He's had a grin on this entire time. This is his own personal wish fulfillment. He's serving this purpose that he's always wanted to. I'm good, guys. I thank you all for your help and I'm gonna thank you 10 times over because I know how this all ends now, but it's good to know at least. I'm happy. I'm good.
3764.64 3805.76 speaker2  And then Keith puts his hand on Clark's shoulder and there's like a sudden, almost like a sound wave or something. Something kind of pushes coming from the tower that you're going to be residing in.
3804.32 3849.04 speaker3  It's a horror game.
3848.32 3855.12 speaker2  I'll feel it. You, you, you, you gotta, but I mean, I'm going to need a lot from you eventually,
3854.08 3866.16 speaker3  So it's all, we're all good. Thank you.
3865.04 3874.40 speaker0  so many last looks.
3873.12 3940.24 speaker2  It's a big moment, Keith. you guys. And then they blip out of this existence and they blip into contention, which at this point has been just completely destroyed by, can you Zach, can you give us a quick rundown of why and how contention has been destroyed? Looking over top at the town of contention.
3934.24 3946.40 speaker0  A snow flurry can be seen under the street lights on an empty country road.
3944.88 3953.92 speaker2  important that it's snowing. Wouldn't it be perfect if it's unseasonably warm?
3953.04 3966.88 speaker0  I like it. Yeah, now it's like I described snow on like half the shit in this. That's me talking about snow.
3965.84 3968.18 speaker3  Yeah, what if you didn't?
3967.68 3970.00 speaker2  Okay.
3969.60 3970.80 speaker3  You know what?
3970.00 3976.88 speaker0  Hey, how about this? Let's try it out. I'm gonna, I'm gonna say what I prepared.
3974.88 3985.92 speaker2  We'll plug in no snow. No, I'm gonna, I'm gonna-
3985.68 4201.36 speaker0  Okay? Are you ready? Yeah. I'll play along. This story ends on an unseasonably Jack Pearlman. A snow flurry- No snow. Can be seen under the street lights on an empty country road. He said the thing. Ahead, there's a blockade made of splintered church pews obstructing the exit and the sign from Subtropolis has been torn down and spray-painted with instructions. Says detour, please keep right. In the quiet parking lot of Hotel Motel, an empty dunking booth sits alone. The door to Keith's room is open and the door to Keith's safe is open as well, around the base of a billboard for a wild business called Owls, Tires, and Tigers. But the word tiger and the picture of the tiger have both turned to ash, making the business look far more mundane. Out north of town, John Lee Pettymore's house sits abandoned. Two sizable holes had been dug deep into the property. Inside, the house is still a mess. There wasn't much time to clean after Keith turned it inside out, looking for cocaine that was buried. Across town is a small vacant baseball diamond. Little bits of snow fall and melt on the metal bleachers, which are lit by a concession hut neon sign for the contention trucks. Trucks bring it. Trucks bring it! Light flickers out the open front door in a way which shows the television is still on. At the twice-forsaken vampire-themed water park, Splashylvania, the spiraling duet of slides that are the two-fanged plunge have been stained brown with the blood of Leo Piston and Julie Maxwell. seems to be missing seven letters from its list of happy hour bottle specials. Corona is missing an N, so Coroa. Bush Lite is missing an L, so Bushite. Past Blue Ribbon, which is missing S-T-U-E-N. Pab- Pable Ribbo. Pable Ribbo.
4198.48 4205.28 speaker2  Is it perhaps R-S-T-L-N-E? It is not.
4201.92 4368.56 speaker0  It is N-L-S-T-U-E-N. The contention woods are silent. There are no people. There are no animals. There's only a slight chilly breeze pushing on the trees gently No snow. Looking through the busted front window of James the Millworker's house treats the viewer into an empty grand piano. Not a string to be hit with a hammer to be found. However, scratches on the tile leading out the front door show that something heavy and metal was pulled up from a hiding spot under the kitchen floor and dragged out of the house. Over at A Plus Storage, three storage units, G10, G11, and G12 sit unlocked, open, and completely empty. The halls of the First Church of Contention are flooded by two feet of water and countless fish swim contentedly from the Sunday School classrooms to the chapel to the baptism tank, which is still filled with water. Alternatively, Chief Maggie Cook's home burned to the ground is just a plot of carbon debris that looks out on a sloppily refilled beans pond next to which lays the lifeless body of Anne Love dressed to die in an emerald green suit with a black silk bow tie. behind icy asymmetrical bangs covering one of her eyes and a big chonky fluffer of a snowflake floats down and lands directly on Agent Karen's exposed blood-red eyeball. The delicate solid slowly dissolves, fills the convex reservoir, and a single crimson drop pushes over the edge of the eye-skin basin and runs down the face of the woman who killed Clark Bishop's parents. As we zoom out, we see the knife he plunged well through the top of her shattered skull. And we continue to zoom out over the quiet town of Contention
4364.00 4399.28 speaker2  and they all show up in the pretty much decimated Contention. Keith pops back into hundreds of Keiths and shouts
4396.56 4447.84 speaker3  We can all agree on that. Whatever he's doing, it looks good. Does he have like a little tiny broom with a dust pan? He's actually really focused on like one little patch of dirt that he can handle himself.
4445.20 4466.64 speaker2  Rinse and repeat for six more days and then... Exactly. Fucking great.
4465.76 4478.96 speaker0  Keith Vermeer. Already? Well, first off, Gary Daley is going to approach Keith with enormous eyes and a sort of reverence. He almost bows as he holds up.
4477.92 4496.96 speaker2  Don't be silly.
4491.28 4513.92 speaker0  Harry'd be real good at working alongside us and getting Keith tension all up and ready to go. If you could, if you could do me that favor.
4513.20 4518.24 speaker1  Can I have one?
4517.76 4530.00 speaker2  Yeah, no.
4525.92 4539.92 speaker0  that I lived in where all this stuff went nutty, but then like at the last minute, maybe he's like Oh, that'd be good. One where I'm dead.
4536.88 4544.80 speaker2  But it's just the first one that opens up. He gets that, gets that one. Okay.
4544.40 4572.24 speaker0  Yeah. Okay. Like I roll under a certain thing.
4571.92 4575.78 speaker3  Okay.
4575.28 4617.84 speaker2  Okay. So shitty. The world that opens up. This is what it feels like to be a player. And I hate it. The world that opens up. Nothing bad has really happened in their lives until one day. Okay.
4617.12 4621.84 speaker1  Oh shit.
4621.20 4628.00 speaker0  11. Chris success.
4626.16 4629.20 speaker1  God, God, that's you.
4628.40 4637.68 speaker0  You can call me Keith.
4635.92 4641.92 speaker1  What kind of sick world you bring me into? I like this a whole lot. Hey, Hey.
4641.28 4642.64 speaker3  Oh my God.
4641.92 4654.26 speaker1  You rolled bad. I wrote good. Hey, I love that. Can we open up clinkers here? That way we can get a good time rolling.
4653.76 4673.68 speaker2  Fuck.
4667.92 4681.44 speaker0  This Tildy B is now wearing a pair of big bull britches.
4680.80 4690.96 speaker1  How?
4688.00 4704.08 speaker2  I can get you your Tildy.
4697.92 4712.40 speaker0  Let's go of this fucking Keith, pushes her away, falls to her knees and starts crying onto the ground.
4711.60 4718.64 speaker2  I'll show you. And he, uh, gets her Tildy.
4717.52 4720.16 speaker1  Oh my God.
4719.44 4724.00 speaker3  All right.
4723.36 4755.68 speaker2  Oh no. less.
4754.88 4786.72 speaker0  into view. Her nail beds are empty, bruises and lesions cover her body and with pure hatred in her eyes, Tildy B. Mitchell shrieks.
4781.92 4818.08 speaker2  And he like kind of reaches his hand out and as you reach your hand out, go ahead and roll. That's a thorny vine. Yeah, that's a success. Her hair quickly grows out. It's almost too long now.
4817.52 4829.76 speaker1  You're doing great.
4819.60 4841.52 speaker2  Her scream turns into like a little girl's cry and everything else is better.
4835.60 4876.98 speaker0  The two of them run off in a warm embrace, crying and speaking to each other like they haven't in days.
4876.48 4881.68 speaker3  God.
4878.88 4891.76 speaker0  We're all like sitting here like, is he going to fucking say? I'm blue.
4887.84 4928.40 speaker3  You see Jack Pearlman riding on his horse past the little shack. He looks very content. Shun. And he's like morning Everett and Everett's out there on, on his, his parcel in the yard there in his long John's. in. And, uh, the, uh, the top of the long John's is hanging off and he's all skin and hunched over bones. tub. Thanks again for this plot of land here. This is, this is, this is what this is all I ever dreamed of.
4927.28 4937.12 speaker1  Anytime.
4933.36 4950.66 speaker3  and, uh, go and check the stock down in his, uh, his root cellar there.
4950.16 4978.98 speaker1  Nice.
4972.18 4983.56 speaker2  glass with various depictions of Keith, his dog beans, some other characters. Oh yeah.
4983.32 4986.78 speaker0  Yeah.
4986.28 5039.56 speaker2  Yeah. And yeah, the camera. back to contention and a lot of people that kind of look like Keith. There were a bunch of people from the city too. Uh, you guys have any questions for me?
5037.72 5058.04 speaker0  welcome to Keith tension. Are you ready for the loose threads montage? Hold on, hold on, hold on.
5056.36 5084.44 speaker2  We didn't have any loose threads, did we?
5082.60 5094.52 speaker0  Oh wait, it's threads we never even touched?
5091.96 5132.28 speaker2  met senators, you fucking morons. while you're moving. And if you interact with them, that's what happens. But otherwise they're still following their own agendas. We just didn't know it included the fucking president.
5125.80 5147.40 speaker0  of gaunt, tall men in white lab coats over black suits work with unnatural efficiency. And one said to the other, so that's what I've been trying to convey to you. I'm not saying you have to vote yes on the bill.
5146.28 5153.56 speaker1  and your husband.
5152.60 5390.36 speaker0  head smashed in. That's what William and Lena beans got for having spines. So now, and he kept talking as all these translucent skinned lab coated creatures, one by one, began popping and morphing into myriad types of Keiths. And just as suddenly they each blipped out of existence entirely. We zoom into the back wall of this now empty lab and focus in on the myriad logo, four And the M logo fades and reveals an ink M formed by a typewriter that has also finished the name that follows, which is Marvin. We're in a dark smoky room and a shaky pair of hands has just placed a transparency of this file on the glass family crime boss on a dusty old overhead projector. A grumbling man says, Marvin Glass is dead. of Keith's genius niece, Francis beans. face of the Francis beans you all left to drown face down in Marvin Glass's fish tank. But the long wobbly fingers of a strangely shaped woman and wonky goggles slowly tap against this corpse currently dead face. With her other hand of equally long wobbly fingers, this mad scientist types out a to do list in her phone's notes, which is like a notebook, but on your phone. Agent McKinley, the old man with dead eyes, is secured to a chair by his straight jacket in the middle of a small padded room. The door opens and agents Kennedy and Harrison on either side make way for Donovan Westhaven in a new black suit. Donovan walks up to the room's threshold, raises his pistol, fires, and the three agents walk away down a hall and into a spacious, well decorated office. She has shoulder length, curly hair, and a mouth that not only takes up half of her face, it is showing an amount of unbridled pleasure you can barely comprehend. So go ahead and choose between Agent Taylor or Agent Garfield. Okie dokie! Yay! funeral, Stan Manstein.
5389.56 5412.92 speaker2  Yes. That's in a cage. Yes. Forced to answer that phone.
5411.24 5438.60 speaker0  and it answers the phone. It writes down notes into a notebook, rips off the page, and hands it, pokes it through What does he look like?
5435.56 5467.72 speaker3  He's wearing it because that's what he did when he designed it. I don't know what that means. It's a long trench coat with a fedora and just a button-down shirt with a tie that's already haphazardly tied around his neck. He's got stubble. Yeah, this is the overseer as a noir style detective.
5466.84 5468.84 speaker0  We're all here for it.
5467.72 5476.04 speaker3  This is his reward.
5470.52 5490.28 speaker0  He takes the piece of paper out of this myriad's hand that's still in the form of Keith for some fucking reason and in this cage. No one will ever see him anyway, it doesn't matter. Blips out to solve his case in a blink of blinding light.
5487.88 5499.40 speaker2  Everybody is having a great time. Seemingly happy, yeah. I've granted wishes to anyone that asked them of me to the best of my ability.
5496.20 5509.32 speaker0  Everybody's having a great time in this weird
5501.40 5648.36 speaker2  Every time the overseer gets back from one of his cases, he describes it to Keith, who is doing a true crime podcast. Oh my God. of a Keith-topia, really. outside the church and there's a big dark something in the sky and everybody's like- and so now everybody can enjoy the darkness. Oh my God. Over the centuries, this town develops no eyeballs, but they can, you know- No more of that, no more of that. You'll not date a dome girl.
5646.52 5671.16 speaker3  I'll hear no more of this.
5667.08 5693.40 speaker1  Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline. Leaving my mind at your altar, crossing the double line, doing it every time.
5687.72 5702.76 speaker3  What kind of world are you living in?
5696.84 5846.04 speaker0  thick enough to obscure any view of what is below and covered in a layer of kudzu. They seem to go on endlessly. there is nothing but dense, verdant forest. A circular, calm lake finds itself somewhere in the midst of this lush wilderness, and in the middle of that lake, a small island with less than a quarter mile from shore to shore. that somehow both overrun the terrain and complement it perfectly. There's a small welcome sign that reads, welcome to calm, comfy campground. At the edge of the water, Maggie Cook sits on top of a bulky metal box. Based on the path left in the wake of this thing, it took some real elbow grease to drag this hefty container all the way out here. But Maggie doesn't look tired from hoofing this thing out to the lake. She looks mentally exhausted, emotionally brutalized. She looks done. Her dad is dead, Fergie is dead, Leon is dead, Anne is dead, and Clark isn't coming. She failed everyone, she failed herself. Maggie Cook stands up and walks toward the large, equally cute and cozy, hexagonal building in the middle of this island. Inside, she finds a thick manila envelope, and her own handwriting is scrawled, New Maggie in black marker. into a room completely filled with stunningly gorgeous flowers in every shade and shape. Maggie Cook takes a deep breath, and shuts the door behind her.
5840.60 5996.20 speaker1  Looks like it's about time for me to leave this newfangled contention. One Keith was too much for me, much too much. But more than that, I can smell that I might be needed elsewhere in some dimension. Me and my dog, Wolf the dog, will always be there when you need us. Just look for us to be, uh, grabbin' a bite at your local diner's dumpster. Remember, y'all, this ain't goodbye, it's smell ya later, my babies. My children, my most trusted confidants, my mortal enemies. But before I go, I do have a brand new song here hot off the presses. Too hot to handle, ouchie ouchie. It's time to premiere this fresh track, this tasty, toasty sonata of a new release. You never heard this song before. It's kudzu with no back bone. With no back bone, no back bone, no back bone. Fight, fight, street me down, takes me back to where you're from. Don't stop, a dime of devotion to only one. Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up, don't give up.
