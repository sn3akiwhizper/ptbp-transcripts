0	5760	What's up everybody? It's Zach. I am Zach and I want to pop in here real quick before this,
5760	12720	the finale of season one with a few announcements. First, this is the last episode. I worked really
12720	18480	hard on it. We've had a stupid amount of fun making this show and we are super proud of what
18480	24560	we've created together this season. Thank you each and every one of you for listening, telling your
24560	30320	friends, posting about the show, creating art based on these characters. I really truly didn't
30320	37280	expect it. This community absolutely rules. Next, we're going to do a couple Q&A episodes here on
37280	45120	the main feed. So please comment your questions in the stickied post on the subreddit or you can tag
45120	54400	at pretending pod on Twitter and use the hashtag PTBPQ. That is hashtag PTBPQ in order to give you
54400	60080	time to ponder what questions to fling at us and in order to give me some time to catch up on some
60080	67040	things. Those Q&A episodes should come out October 22nd and October 29th. So if you have any
67040	73120	questions, comments, or compliments, find that post in the subreddit or tag us on Twitter at pretending
73120	82480	pod with the hashtag PTBPQ. Hashtag PTBPQ. Finally, we are changing one of our Patreon tiers.
82480	89680	A Splashylvania Fastpass is still only $5. You still get access to all 24 of our bonus episodes
89680	97680	and it's still only $6.66 if you want the same stuff but also you're rad. The cover charge at
97680	104240	the Den of Sin is still $15 if you dare join us behind the scenes as we record our Patreon bonus
104240	109040	episodes and we finish out those streams by hanging out with the chat and playing some Jackbox.
109040	117760	But there's a new tier in town. For $25, you can join the Circle of Knowledge Shirt Club.
117760	123120	Once you're in the Circle of Knowledge Shirt Club, you can choose and receive a Patreon exclusive
123120	129680	shirt from a rotating pool of designs like the Splashylvania Vampire on a Surfboard shirt,
129680	137040	the four items from the Trunk shirt, and the Den of Sin Juice Box shirt. These pieces were created
137040	144400	respectively by Sean McFarland at slide.whistle and Andy Corbett. Check him out on Instagram,
144400	150000	Twitter, Facebook, or Patreon and then follow these dope artists and support them too.
150000	155840	And here's a sweet little deal for those of you listening as this is being released. If you join
155840	159840	the Circle of Knowledge Shirt Club or a higher tier in the month of October,
159840	167360	we'll count this month as your second month in that tier. A whole month closer to that sweet,
167360	175520	sweet t-shirt. And extra finally, we are going to do a live stream for all our patrons over at
175520	183200	patreon.com slash pretending pod this upcoming Tuesday, October 12th at 9pm central time. Taylor
183200	188560	and I brought back some snacks from Korea for the boys to try, so join us for a super relaxed hang
188560	194080	for a couple hours. We'll try some snacks, shoot the shit, and answer some questions. That stream
194080	202000	and a link to the playback will be available to all patrons. So, make it happen. And as Wolf says,
202000	208400	all the links are in the show notes. Now, back to you, Wolfie. Wolfie, Wolfie.
208400	217520	Well, well, well. Look who finally showed up to the grease pit. It's you, my beautiful child.
217520	226080	Join me in the barrel. Take a load off. Uh, wait, no, don't. Get hyped. Because you are
226160	235040	tuned into the biggest, baddest radio station on this dimensions block. 694.2 PTBP.
236640	243520	We got a new Howlin' with Wolf this week, and it comes from someone named Curtain Plastic,
243520	249360	who did the most damnedest, gosh darn dirtiest, delicious, dutiful thing you can do.
250240	257520	She wrote us a five-star review on Apple Podcasts. Hell yeah, dude. She writes,
257520	263200	I would like to shout out my D&D group, who I hope will soon dive into the world of Delta
263200	273120	Green with me. Shout out to my two amazing DMs, Zach and Nick. To my fellow player, Will,
273120	280960	and to the love of my life, who I'm honored to roleplay in more than one way with Lucas.
280960	287520	Also, shout out to Zach, Luke, Joe, Thomas, and Justin for all the hard work and time
287520	295360	y'all have put into this. Y'all are fucking killing it. Well, thanks, Curtain Plastic.
295360	302960	But I, uh, can't help but notice that you didn't include little old Wolfie in your shout out list.
303520	310000	I'm gonna assume it's because, uh, we all just know who really makes the show so great.
310000	317200	It's, uh, me is who. And my producer, somewhat, I guess. And now I want to let it be known,
317200	325200	I have never been invited to a D&D group. Not a single time. And I still don't really know
325200	332160	what the hell y'all are doing in these groups. And honestly, it freaks me the freak out. So I never
332160	339200	ask. Y'all, when Instagram went down, a part of me rejoiced because finally all of y'all were living
339200	345600	in Wolfie's world. The other part of me that is bound by my producer's contract is here to tell
345600	352560	you to follow along and tag the show at pretending pod. There's even a handy link in the show notes
352560	364640	for now. Because the internet, Gambino Nice, might go down again. Ooh, spooky.
365920	373920	We're proud to have a new sponsor here at 694.2 PTBP. I think this sponsor is very good and
373920	381680	necessary. So this week's news segment is brought to you by Fuck Mark Zuckerberg. It's time for the
381680	389600	news. Last time, Keith turned into Keith's and eliminated the threat of the wormy ceiling.
389600	397040	Pretty straightforward stuff, I'd say. And now for the last time, an absolute banger.
397040	401200	It's Dragon in Three with What Kind of World Are You Living In?
401200	415600	Bad girls on top of the water. Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline.
415600	424320	Leaving my mind at your altar. Crossing the double line, doing it every time. Tell me what
424320	437440	kind of world are you living in? What kind of world are you living in?
443120	446880	Was that your fingers? That's like definitely 30 seconds.
446880	448640	I didn't think it was going to be that loud.
448640	454800	Dude, why would you do anything that made sound?
456800	459440	Because I was like, I don't know. In the only 30 seconds.
461360	468000	This will be an excellent time to pop my nuts. Honestly, that's the thought that went through
468000	471280	my mind. I'm like, I'm going to do it right now. It's nice and quiet now.
472960	476160	It's going to be so loud. I think maybe subconsciously I was like,
476800	480080	let's see how loud it is. When you were a kid at school and
480080	485120	they made you do 30 seconds of silence at school, did you pop your knuckles during that?
485120	491440	No, I was a super follow the rules kind of kid. Before they recorded your glasses?
492240	495040	What the fuck are you talking about? Well, you got to get room noise.
495920	498800	Just one day out of the year really needed room noise.
498800	503840	I'm recording you all. Class, as you know, it's September 11th today and we need to get room
503840	508960	noise. Class, as you know, this is a two-party consent state, so I am informing you that you
508960	514240	are being recorded. If any of you little fuckers have a problem with that, you speak up now.
514240	519920	And then they read Where the Redfern Grows audiobook. They're recording the audiobook.
519920	522000	Yeah. Damn it.
525360	527680	All right, you guys ready to start? No.
527680	529520	Am I on a big TV again? Yeah.
529520	531760	Yeah. Am I full screen?
532320	536560	You are. You're like almost life-sized. You're like three-quarter Justin.
536560	542000	Your beard mustache looks incredible. There's not really a beard anymore, right?
542000	544800	Well, it's like chops. Chops mustache.
544800	546000	Yeah. Burns mustache.
546000	549920	When this is gone, is a beard a beard if there is no chin in the hair?
549920	553280	You don't have a beard. No, you have long side burns into a mustache with a little dopey.
553280	557120	Dude, your mustache connects to your burns. I think you've got a beard.
557120	560560	I don't think you have a beard. Oh, is that the differentiator?
560560	563440	I would call what you have right now. I wouldn't call it a beard.
563440	566240	Almost a beard. I don't know. I would call it a beard.
566240	569360	I disagree. You don't have a beard right now. It's a variety of beard.
570640	573200	I like it though. This internet website
573200	578880	claims that that style of facial hair is called Friendly Mutton Chops.
578880	582960	Oh, I don't like that name at all. I do.
582960	587920	I feel like mutton chops, once you've got chops, that's a beard, not just sideburns.
588000	597040	I feel like mutton chops are not grown down. If your hair was longer, you know what I mean?
598640	603120	If you think of a dude with a mutton chop thing. I'm thinking Red Dead style mutton chops.
603120	606160	We'll have to take a group picture. If you take the mutton chops down to a two,
606160	609840	then you've got what he's got. Those are lamb chops.
609840	612000	You've got lamb chops. I like lamb chops.
612000	616880	Gentlemen, lamb chops. We'll have to take a group picture with the TV.
616960	617760	Yes. That'll be fun.
619520	620240	Oh, goodness.
621680	626880	Oh, it just froze on Zach whenever you went, like when you started laughing and it faded.
626880	627920	It went like... You went like...
632960	634320	Get a good Jimmy Carr laugh in there.
640720	642080	That's not... It's a little bit...
642080	648080	It starts... He's hawking from the beginning.
652160	654400	It's more staccato though. There's bigger breaks.
660240	661840	It sounds so fake.
661840	664640	Not knowing what Jimmy Carr's laugh sounds like.
664640	665200	Did we nail it?
665200	666160	That was great.
666160	670480	It's a weird thing, but I didn't even notice that was a thing until I saw that video,
670480	671600	like compilation of it.
672160	675680	I was like, he's got a hearty laugh. He's a jovial man.
675680	677920	And then I saw that and I was like, oh yeah, that's fucking weird.
679680	680960	We've come to the end, guys.
681760	683760	I mean, we're not there yet. We have an episode to go.
685360	686320	But this is that.
686320	687360	This is that episode.
688960	690000	Is this 113?
690000	692080	I bet we can drag this out for two or three more.
694880	695920	I don't think so, man.
695920	701680	When we started, I don't know what number I had in my head, but I don't think it was this many.
702880	703680	For one season.
703680	708320	I think I told you guys in the forties, mid forties.
708320	710320	I'm glad it's been this long, though.
710320	711360	We've done a lot of stuff.
711360	714960	It's also been a running thing that you would often say to us,
714960	717360	okay, this next part's going to take an episode.
717360	719520	And then that next part would be five episodes.
721280	725840	That's also a running thing from our very first role-playing games together,
725840	727600	where you're like, I think this will take an evening.
727600	729040	And then it took a month.
729040	730160	Exactly, yep.
730160	730960	Oh yeah.
730960	734720	Yeah, I forget if it was like a couple episodes ago or whatever,
734720	738960	but listening to it where it was like, yeah, this whole time, five days.
738960	741600	Five days, yeah, right.
741600	742240	Which thing?
742240	744080	We did go back in time a couple times.
744960	745440	That's true.
745440	746800	It's more like a few hundred years.
746800	747520	We had to offshoot.
747520	750960	This one in particular makes sense for as far as five days ago.
752320	754240	We relived that one afternoon.
754240	754740	A lot.
756080	760560	At least we never went to a Waffle House and made our orders in character,
760720	765200	like we made Zach listen to one time at our home session.
765200	768080	It was like the first campaign that we were running,
768080	772080	and before you even dove into the scenario at hall,
772080	774080	you were like, our characters are probably hungry.
774880	777360	It was when we thought about sleeping and eating food.
777360	780960	So I was like, okay, let's go to this Waffle House.
780960	782800	And I wanted pancakes.
782800	785040	You guys want to go to Waffle House after this?
785040	785540	No.
785920	789360	Luke wanted pancakes, so then they had to go across the street.
789360	792400	I think it was the pancake palace, I'm pretty sure.
792400	794720	Yeah, it wasn't a Waffle House, it was a pancake palace.
794720	801440	And then we went through a full round of ordering breakfast foods and drinks
801440	802960	where I just played your server.
804240	805680	Did you like that?
805680	808960	Yes, it's my favorite role-playing moment of all time.
810480	812240	I wish I was at Waffle House right now,
812240	814640	and I'm pretty pissed Luke said he didn't want to get it after this.
814640	820880	You didn't want to celebrate the end of recording season one with a trip to Waffle House?
823840	825760	That is so incomprehensible to me.
827200	829040	I eat Waffle House for lunch sometimes,
829040	831040	because it's like right down the street from my work,
831680	833200	and I'm sad every time I do.
834080	836640	Are you getting dope waffles and eggs,
836640	838960	or are you getting a sensible lunch meal?
838960	840640	No, I get breakfast food every time.
840640	841600	Breakfast food.
841600	842720	Breakfast food.
842720	843760	Breakfast food?
844400	846960	If you don't like their eggs, hash browns, and waffles...
846960	849120	Hey, I'm not saying I don't like it.
849120	855120	I'm saying when I go there by myself at 12 30 on a Tuesday,
855120	856400	I'm a little bit sad.
856400	856960	You get the blue mood.
856960	859680	Yeah, but is that like a pre-existing condition or...
859680	863840	I get the blue mood and the waitress comes up she's like,
863840	864960	you got sweaty blood.
866720	867040	Okay.
867040	868960	I know, give me the fucking hash browns.
868960	872080	You're telling me you still have the blue mood after the waitress calls you hun.
872640	875680	Yeah, I say I want the hash browns chopped and screwed.
881200	883760	What is your Waffle House hash brown order, Joe?
883760	885840	Smothered, covered, diced, I think is what I do.
885840	886240	Luke?
886240	887920	Smothered, covered, capped.
887920	888720	Smothered, covered.
888720	889760	Scattered, covered, smothered.
889760	890320	What, scattered?
891040	891520	Crispy.
891520	893440	Where it's all crispy, yeah.
893440	896800	So I think that's a holdover, because you can ask for ring also.
896800	898800	I think you get scattered if you don't ask for ring.
898800	900800	No, it specifically says scattered like crispy.
901600	905920	Because they make it thinner so that it all gets the even coating.
905920	909440	I like the crisp on top and I like that little mushy underneath.
910080	911680	I like a little mush to it.
911680	915200	I like almost like a cake, like a latke.
915200	918240	Justin, do you have a Waffle House hash brown order?
918240	922160	I just get them extra crispy and then I throw salt and pepper and ketchup on them,
922160	923120	because I'm a monster.
923120	924960	I throw a Tabasco sauce on there.
924960	926080	Tabasco, that's right.
926080	927600	A little hot sauce too, yeah.
927600	931200	I generally like to mix them up with my over-easy eggs
931200	932640	and get all that yolk up in the hash browns.
932640	933600	There's your problem, dude.
933600	935760	You're not getting them scrambled cheesy eggs.
935760	938400	I'm a big mix all your food together type of guy.
938400	938880	Hard saying.
939440	943920	Yeah, my eggs go right on top of those hash browns as soon as it arrives.
943920	944720	Flop them.
944720	945600	Flop them on top.
946160	949680	Dude, I went to W.F. Cody's for lunch today.
949680	950720	Love W.F. Cody's.
950720	953840	I ordered a half pound Larry Burger, which is-
953840	954720	That's the one to get.
954720	957200	Yeah, with American cheese, fried egg.
957680	958960	It was packed in there.
958960	961200	I had to like sit at the bar at a-
961200	963520	You found this tiny chair that was just sitting in the corner.
963520	966480	Well, I was sitting right next to the touch tunes thing,
966480	968080	which is super fucking annoying,
968080	970800	because there was a bunch of drunk people in there at-
970800	971600	This is lunch?
971600	972640	This is 1230.
972640	973920	Oh, it's W.F. Cody's.
973920	974420	Yeah.
976880	980240	Bunch of drunk people playing pool like trying to like shove me out of the way
980240	982160	so that they could play their touch tunes next.
982160	985360	Anyway, she brings out the full pound burger and I'm like,
985360	986880	I didn't order that.
986880	988160	And she's like, oh, sorry.
988160	989760	I just rang it in wrong.
990400	992240	Did you want to eat all this meat?
992240	997600	I'm like, I eat it, but I don't want to pay seven extra dollars for it.
997600	999520	And she's like, just eat it.
999520	1003120	I ate the whole fucking thing and I felt like shit all the rest of the day.
1003120	1003760	Yeah, dude.
1003760	1005120	Half a pound is like too big.
1005120	1006080	Half a pound is a lot, man.
1006080	1010400	I ate a whole one pound burger and most of the fries that came with it.
1010400	1012160	Well, I guess it's a double quarter pounder.
1012160	1013120	Hungry boy.
1013760	1016160	I ate a quadruple quarter pounder.
1016160	1016660	Yeah.
1018640	1025040	I actually celebrated my 21st birthday at W.F. Cody's when I was 18 years old.
1025840	1029040	At 1230 in the afternoon.
1029680	1034640	We went in and like, they just sang me happy birthday and we did the whole thing
1034640	1036640	and they brought shots out for us.
1036640	1038400	Well, you just said you were 21.
1038400	1039920	We could probably go do that now.
1039920	1043520	Who's turning 21?
1043520	1043920	You?
1043920	1044320	Sure.
1044320	1044560	Yeah.
1044560	1045120	Whatever.
1045120	1046720	As long as you're singing happy birthday.
1046720	1048480	I mean, if anybody's turning 21, it's me.
1048480	1049600	Yeah, it would be Lukey.
1049600	1052480	And I would say just give me a full one pound burger.
1053840	1055360	I'm down to eat two pounds of meat today.
1055360	1056720	Two pounds of burger today.
1056720	1060800	Okay, so we've got you guys in this realm that you've been in.
1060800	1061920	I think that was good for an episode.
1061920	1063760	Okay, yeah, let's wrap it here.
1063760	1064960	Let's 113.
1064960	1066080	We'll see you all.
1066080	1067840	It'll be a couple of weeks before 114.
1068800	1070960	Actually, I think finale 120.
1070960	1071840	That sounds good.
1071840	1077680	I think finale 120 and the next, what, six episodes recap of the whole thing.
1080720	1083200	And then we'll do the finale.
1083200	1083760	The actual finale.
1083760	1084640	Well, no, no, no.
1084640	1087520	What I think we should do is this should just be the finale.
1091200	1092160	We'll see how that goes.
1092160	1096720	We'll put that out and be like episode 113 is the finale and then never release an episode.
1097920	1099760	Oh, that's fun.
1099760	1100880	That's a lot of fun.
1100880	1108000	That would really fuck with some people disappear and become like insurance salesman and
1111680	1114400	bankers, bankers, bankers.
1114400	1120480	It's so, so, so dark in this waffle house.
1121520	1122720	I feel God.
1123440	1124880	In this waffle house.
1127600	1131920	I'm going to be an asshole and say, I got to, let me just piss before we actually
1131920	1135760	get into the, we're in a good, like we're rolling here.
1135760	1136320	It's been hot.
1138640	1150400	It is so dark here and you feel so content and so strange this whole time you felt this way,
1150400	1158640	but there was so much going on, so much stress, so much noise, so many threats challenging
1158640	1162400	what the rest of your lives, your existence will be.
1162400	1166480	Not only your existence, but the existence of everyone you've ever known.
1166480	1171120	And not only the individuals that you've come into contact with, but every version
1172160	1175840	of those individuals and every version of yourselves.
1176560	1179600	That's all been at risk until now.
1181040	1186880	The voices of the Keiths ring out almost infinitely.
1191440	1192720	It's just one of them eating it.
1193840	1198000	They've somehow manifested it into all of their hands.
1198640	1198880	Okay.
1198880	1201280	Now it brought the Oreo McFlurry in the first place.
1201280	1204800	You think myriad can't get itself an Oreo fucking McFlurry.
1204800	1210240	So Keith, as myriad, have you changed the physical appearance of
1210320	1211040	these creatures?
1213040	1218960	As a myriad was popping in, they were popping in in the form of Keith.
1219920	1229120	Keith, who was in the body of the myriad that he had switched into within seconds, minutes,
1229120	1230880	had switched forms.
1231520	1240240	Every myriad is Keith, but Keith's body, inhabited by myriad, is also still Keith.
1240800	1241040	Right.
1241040	1245600	So do you know where that is, or has he wandered off into the crowd of Keiths?
1245600	1246400	Oh, no.
1246400	1248320	He's the only one without a McFlurry.
1248320	1248560	Yeah.
1249200	1249920	Yes.
1249920	1257120	The only Keith without a McFlurry is myriad Keith, and Keiths are keeping an eye on it.
1257120	1260320	As he was copping about trying to get used to his body,
1261120	1266240	Keith in the body of myriad just slides by and lifts the McFlurry out of his hand.
1266960	1267840	Oh, yeah.
1267840	1274480	Well, as soon as myriad Keiths took the McFlurry out of Keith,
1278080	1280560	then every myriad Keith had a McFlurry in there.
1280560	1282160	Had a McFlurry, of course.
1282160	1283440	What are the Keiths wearing?
1284240	1287440	Refer back to episode one of pretending to be people.
1287440	1288320	I just did.
1288320	1289200	Police uniform.
1289200	1290080	Pants are too big.
1290080	1290720	Big old bridges.
1290720	1291600	Big old bridges.
1291600	1293280	Well, most of them are wearing that.
1293280	1299120	Some of them are wearing too tight polo with way too big cargo shorts.
1299120	1304320	Some are wearing the other things that Keith has worn throughout.
1305120	1307200	Are there any other classic Keith outfits?
1307200	1311920	Well, are there any Dan Flashes Keiths as a little wink to Keith's creator, Luke?
1311920	1315120	Some of the Keiths look at some of the new ones popping in and they're like,
1315120	1317040	that's a really complicated shirt.
1317040	1322320	As Keith gets more confident in manifesting the myriads, he's getting fancier and fancier.
1323520	1326320	They're becoming more like the true vision that Keith has of himself.
1327280	1334240	And literally by the second, there's 10, 20, 40, 1,000, 10,000 Keiths popping in.
1335120	1338640	But the one Keith without the McFlurry is copping around.
1339280	1342480	And main Keith sits him down on the ground.
1353120	1355360	And Keith is like pointing his two fingers at his eyes.
1356320	1356820	Yeah.
1364240	1364740	Okay.
1368640	1383600	And when you look around at the boys, you see a chanting luminous land liturgy still keeping up
1383600	1388560	with overclocking this Clark Bishop that has become the overseer.
1388560	1391680	And you also see Clark Bishop standing nearby.
1392320	1395600	You see Planet Juggernaut who is being topped by...
1396560	1401360	That's not what I meant.
1401360	1402880	Did you mean perhaps mounted?
1402880	1403380	Mounted.
1404240	1406720	Yeah, ridden hard by...
1406720	1409120	A word with no connotation whatsoever.
1409120	1418880	Mounted by this John that has been created out of himself, out of this muck that is dark
1418880	1421840	and just wondrous collection of colors.
1421840	1426160	Some of which the human eye, your specific human eyes have never been able to comprehend
1426160	1427840	before are twisted in.
1427840	1428400	You know what?
1428400	1434000	As much as it sparkles and flashes, there's two little extra bright spots for his eyes.
1434000	1434800	Oh, I love that.
1435440	1438800	And he's got a cowboy hat mounting his head.
1439440	1439940	Yeah.
1440560	1441360	Topping his head.
1444480	1445760	That is the group that you see.
1446560	1453200	The only people who are here who are not chanting, the bodies of both Drew Pages...
1453840	1454400	Fuck me.
1455040	1457760	Drew Pages and Carrie...
1457760	1460000	Drew Andrews and Carrie Pages.
1460000	1465680	Keith is looking around for people that aren't Keith and he's getting pretty fucking confused
1465680	1467760	because he's seeing lots of different kinds of Keiths.
1467760	1471520	He's seeing fancy Keiths, expensive shirt Keiths.
1471520	1472960	He's seeing big pants Keiths.
1474240	1476960	And he's like, sits down, closes his eyes.
1477600	1480160	All of a sudden there's only one Keith.
1480800	1481360	Cool.
1481360	1481920	Nice.
1481920	1485520	Don, you have just, I mean...
1485520	1488400	Well, so the John sacrificed itself.
1488400	1490080	So I think that was the ball.
1490080	1490560	Yeah.
1490560	1491600	So that ball is torched.
1491600	1492960	I think you're released.
1492960	1493360	Yeah.
1493360	1497760	Don is his own man now, once again.
1497760	1500640	Yeah, as you see that skeleton of your brother or nephew.
1502160	1505040	What does it look like when a, when a ball burns out?
1505040	1506400	Has that happened before?
1506400	1511200	No, it's just this charred one inch in diameter sphere.
1511200	1513200	Like a bad marshmallow.
1513200	1517840	I'm thinking of like, you know, when you burn one of those snake fireworks.
1517840	1519440	That's what the whole deal looks like.
1520000	1520160	Yeah.
1520160	1523360	That's what I was imagining because as the huge legs, I was wondering if it just like...
1524480	1524640	Yeah.
1524640	1526240	It's all been kind of floating above you.
1526240	1528640	And then it just, it just collapses to the ground.
1528640	1532400	All made out of that snake firework material.
1532400	1532880	Yes.
1532880	1533600	Pure carbon.
1535600	1540720	Don is like absolutely exhausted and kind of like on his hands and knees on the ground
1540720	1545920	after using all of his, as much magic as he's ever used in that short amount of time
1545920	1547120	in his entire life.
1547760	1549840	Just emotionally overwhelmed by everything.
1549840	1555920	I think he's kind of taken a breather in this second after just the complete,
1555920	1558160	completely overwhelmed by everything.
1558160	1562880	The wand is still in his hand and he feels a fiery glow from it for a moment.
1563600	1566000	And then that fiery glow.
1566800	1568000	No, he's alive in that one.
1569440	1570080	Not alive.
1570080	1570960	There's something.
1570960	1572400	He's got a special magic wand now.
1573360	1576640	Special John, a magic John wand.
1576640	1579520	If you want a wand, you get your magic John wand.
1579520	1581200	I know the discord said they liked when we sing,
1581200	1583280	but it doesn't mean it's just like always good when we sing.
1585040	1585600	Wow.
1585840	1589840	Magic John, if you want to John have your magic John one.
1589840	1595120	If you had a John ever magic John one, if you want to John have your magic John one.
1596800	1597300	Wow.
1597840	1598720	That was impressive.
1598720	1604320	Keith is sitting there like he's hearing this from some like alternative plane.
1604320	1607280	He's like, what the fuck is going on here?
1608000	1610240	He's hearing the magic John one song.
1610240	1617120	Amongst every other song that we've ever sang.
1617120	1618880	Yeah, key that up now Zach.
1618880	1619380	Fuck you.
1621440	1626480	Can Don in fact feel like the presence of John in this?
1626480	1627840	Yeah, you can feel John in this wand.
1627840	1631120	I feel God in this waffle house.
1632080	1632560	Nailed it.
1632560	1635600	I think it's just, you feel, you know, you've got like a magic sword.
1635600	1641520	I think Don clutches it close to his chest kind of as he's like crumpled over a little bit
1641520	1645840	with like the little embers still burning a little bit from the wand.
1646400	1646900	Drew!
1648560	1649060	Drew!
1651440	1652400	Don't you know everything?
1652400	1653600	Can't you just look at him?
1656800	1657440	Keith is not.
1658000	1659200	He's not grown accustomed to.
1659200	1664640	It's been literally seconds or minutes since he's been in this.
1664720	1667840	The body of Kerry pages runs up to you and is like, hello.
1667840	1668640	Hello, sir.
1668640	1669280	Oh my God.
1669920	1670640	Oh my God.
1670640	1671840	It is so good to see.
1671840	1672720	And they'll shut up.
1674160	1679120	And Keith is just like rubbing his head because in Keith's mind he's just hearing things from
1679120	1682400	different planes of reality and it's really fucking him up.
1685760	1687040	And he points at the radio.
1688320	1688960	Get Kerry.
1689520	1690160	Get Kerry.
1691040	1692800	Councilwoman Kerry pages here.
1692800	1695440	And if you are willing to make.
1695440	1695940	Shut up.
1696800	1702320	And Keith pops up and just hands the radio to Drew.
1703520	1706080	Pushes the two together and flips the switch.
1706080	1707200	How are you powering it?
1707840	1709280	It's still broken technically.
1709280	1710880	So it needs some ooze inside.
1710880	1714320	Three or four Keith's pop up handfuls of ooze.
1717760	1721680	They slam some ooze into this glass chamber that's shattered.
1721680	1726000	But they put the ooze just in enough to where the light flips.
1726000	1726800	Turns green.
1726800	1728720	Green light lit on this radio.
1729840	1737440	A bright flash lights up and you see shadows of each of you in the endless horizon.
1737440	1744560	And because there's nothing to stop the light really for an almost indeterminate amount
1744560	1751280	of space away from you, your shadows all light up and look enormous.
1752480	1754160	Surrounding this place.
1754160	1754720	That's cool.
1755520	1756640	And in the darkness.
1760160	1760660	Fellas.
1762080	1763520	Oh my God, it's me.
1763520	1764960	It's me and I'm inside me.
1766880	1770960	The younger of the Clarks goes running up to him and grabbing him by the shoulders.
1770960	1772400	And he's smiling big.
1772400	1773280	Drew, Drew.
1773280	1774320	Bubblegum tree.
1774320	1775520	Bubblegum tree.
1775520	1776240	But we did it.
1776240	1777520	It gives you a huge hug.
1777520	1778160	We did it.
1778800	1783360	Muck John descends down in front of him and tips his cowboy hat and says, welcome back.
1784640	1788080	John, John, you're, you're amazing.
1788640	1789760	I know, bud.
1789760	1790480	Look at you.
1791440	1793120	Oh, look at all of you.
1793120	1794800	Oh, you did so good.
1796160	1796960	Oh my God.
1797520	1799920	And then he starts transforming before your eyes.
1799920	1805120	And his tentacles come out of his head.
1805120	1806240	Drew Thulu.
1808160	1816560	A million keys come out and just suffocate.
1820320	1820880	Thank you.
1820880	1822160	Thank you so much.
1822160	1829280	Officer Bishop, you have, and she's crying and you hear through this darkness, these
1829280	1830160	licks, these.
1834160	1835920	Oh, Oh Tyler.
1835920	1836560	Oh Tyler.
1836560	1837440	You're so good.
1837440	1838240	Oh my goodness.
1838240	1839600	I put a hand on her shoulder.
1840560	1842080	I told you I'd find him.
1842080	1842880	Oh, thank you.
1843600	1845520	You've saved my contention.
1848400	1848720	Okay.
1848720	1851280	So if we're here, are we here forever?
1851280	1852240	Do we set up?
1852240	1853680	What's first a post office?
1856720	1858000	Overseer starts walking over.
1858640	1864240	Well, I, I guess, I guess it's up to us at this point, what happens now.
1864240	1871200	But, uh, I think with the help of Mir, Mir, Miria, Keith here, Keith, Keith Reed,
1871200	1876720	Keith, Keith is like sitting cross-legged on the ground, like rubbing his temples.
1876720	1878480	Like looks like he's in pain.
1878480	1883200	I think with, uh, with his help here, I think, I think I can, I can handle some, some rebuilding
1883200	1886560	and I think he can probably navigate better than I can.
1886560	1889440	I think we can set things right at this point.
1889440	1893600	Because Keith beans is, is now a Heinz mind.
1895040	1895540	Yeah.
1895760	1896260	Yeah.
1896800	1897280	Close enough.
1897280	1898080	Close enough, Drew.
1898800	1904640	Or maybe he's, when there's a bunch of them, he's the creatures of the black legume.
1904640	1905840	No, that was actually great.
1905840	1906880	Because of the beans.
1906880	1908160	That's a good, that's a really good one.
1908160	1909200	You like that one?
1909200	1909840	That's really good.
1909840	1911040	Those are the only two I have.
1911040	1912240	God, it's good to see you again.
1912240	1913600	And Overseer gives him a hug.
1915280	1921520	Oh, and Drew is just like, oh man, in this like triangle hug between the two Clark Bishops.
1924240	1928880	His face is just poking through and between their shoulders and looking up to this muck
1928880	1929520	John.
1929520	1932240	Who slips a tentacle of who's in there and like pats his back.
1933360	1936240	You know, you, uh, you didn't do what I told you to do.
1936240	1939520	You ended up going to Maggie's and he looks angry for a second.
1939520	1940240	Yeah.
1940240	1941440	And then he smiles.
1941440	1943120	It brought us here though, I guess.
1943120	1945760	Uh, I'm sorry.
1946640	1947840	All's well that ends well.
1949840	1950800	I was really scared.
1951760	1954320	I've been scared for so long.
1957200	1957760	Five days.
1958960	1962240	It's a long time when you're trapped inside a council woman.
1962240	1963520	A lot of responsibility.
1963520	1964480	Oh my goodness.
1964480	1965280	The meetings.
1967120	1973600	As, as everybody's talking, Keith is like starting to turn pale and like sweating.
1973600	1979520	And the whole area is starting to kind of rumble a little bit.
1979600	1981600	Keith, you, uh, you okay over there?
1981600	1982640	We got to get out of here.
1983520	1983840	Why?
1983840	1984080	Why?
1985120	1986160	This can be our home.
1986720	1989520	This, I mean, it's not much to look at.
1989520	1996880	I can hear so many things from everywhere and I think we just need to get back.
1996880	1999280	I just don't want to hear all of this anymore.
1999280	2002240	It's your old Keith almighty situation.
2002240	2004000	I hope it's Bruce and not Evan.
2004000	2010400	I mean, yeah, I guess you, you're kind of are the sequel to myriad though.
2010400	2014880	So you might be Evan.
2017280	2018800	I myself, John Lee Pennymore.
2018800	2019440	I liked them.
2019440	2023440	Keith's eyes open up wide and he's like, we have to get out of here.
2024080	2026160	I will not be Evan almighty.
2028080	2031920	All right, well let's Steve corral everyone up and then let's get out of here.
2032480	2032800	Wow.
2034000	2034800	You're really laying them down.
2035920	2038320	You're positively giddy to be back in your body.
2038320	2042000	Boys, boys, boys, boys, what do we want to do?
2043840	2044800	Where do we want to go?
2046400	2047360	We can do anything.
2048400	2052720	We being me, but also we being us.
2052720	2059280	Overseer saying, well, yeah, uh, we, we, we can, we can do, we can do whatever, whatever
2059280	2060720	we, we want.
2060720	2062880	And he turns to younger Clark.
2063920	2072720	I'm, uh, I'm not, I'm not sure that you can, I think, uh, I think you need to do the things
2072720	2076560	that I did because that's how I ended up here.
2076560	2079600	Somebody, somebody has to be the overseer when this all happens.
2081360	2085680	When it happened, it's, it's the short end of the stick.
2086160	2092000	It's, uh, it's not, uh, it's not ideal, but, uh, as he's saying all this to Clark, there's
2092000	2095520	not a single thing in his face that gives away anything.
2095520	2097840	He is smiling broad and big.
2098800	2100800	And he goes, yeah, dude, no, of course.
2100800	2105200	Uh, that's, uh, I had already thought about that and I'm, I'm looking forward to it.
2105200	2107680	I, I, I, I'm the, I, I win.
2107680	2108720	I'm the, I'm the savior.
2108720	2110240	I'm the, I'm the guy who does everything.
2110240	2116400	I, it's, I become you and then you work with me in the future and cool.
2116400	2117520	Send me where you need me to.
2117520	2118720	Just, just shoot me away.
2118720	2119120	I'm good.
2119120	2120720	I'm I've got plans.
2120720	2123840	I know I need to run and to tell Drew something sometime.
2123840	2124720	I'll, I'll write them down.
2124720	2125760	I'll write down all the notes.
2125760	2126240	I got it.
2126240	2127440	I got it.
2127440	2128240	Just shoot me on.
2129040	2130480	I'm ready to go.
2130480	2136160	As soon as he says that, a, a Keith pops up behind him with like this, uh, kind of almost
2136160	2141760	like golden robe with a very long hood and just, you know, the one you've been seeing
2141760	2146080	the overseer wear this whole time and places it over.
2146080	2148400	Clark said, well, that's, that's an upgrade.
2149200	2150400	It looks good on you though.
2150400	2152240	The Keith pops out of existence.
2153760	2157120	Clark, that just, uh, just take it easy out there.
2157120	2164160	It's a, it's a long, long, long road, but I got you set up over in that tower over there.
2164160	2165920	You should be, you should be, have all the things you need there.
2165920	2167200	That's kind of your home base.
2167200	2168240	That's where I set up.
2169200	2170400	It's a, it's up to you now.
2171040	2171360	Cool.
2171360	2171680	Right on.
2171680	2174960	I'll, I'll, uh, you guys, uh, Hey, it was great working with you guys.
2175920	2179360	Uh, I'm glad, I'm, I'm glad it ended up the way it did.
2179360	2184480	Uh, Keith, uh, congratulations on your new found powers and John.
2184480	2188240	And it's been the ride of a lifetime or several.
2189520	2190560	Is this it Clark?
2190560	2191280	That's it.
2191280	2191840	Yeah.
2191840	2192720	Afraid so.
2192720	2196080	I mean, I'll see you guys a lot coming up.
2196080	2200800	Uh, there's a lot of, a lot of looping and resetting and I, I kind of, I kind of twiddle
2200800	2201440	my fingers in there.
2201440	2205280	You guys remember, but I guess you won't know that it's me then.
2205840	2206800	It's it's all right.
2206800	2208880	I'm, I'm sure I'll get used to it.
2208880	2216320	Keith stands up and feeling pretty emotional thinking that he might not see Clark for maybe
2216320	2221840	not ever again, but maybe not for a little while and kind of loses control of his emotions
2221840	2228480	and hundreds of thousands of Keith's appear behind him and they all, you know, our little
2228480	2233600	tear running down their face and Keith reaches his hand out to Clark.
2233600	2237120	Clark slaps it away and brings him in for a big old Clark bear hug.
2237760	2240800	And Keith just hugs him as tight as he can.
2240800	2243680	Two or three other Keith's come in and hug him too.
2243680	2244640	It's a dog pile.
2247680	2250640	John, John, get on in here.
2252240	2259120	Like iridescent tears are streaming down his face and, um, he, he makes himself look a
2259120	2260160	little more like John.
2260160	2266720	It's less the goo, the goo world, John, and he kind of manifests the John you knew on
2266720	2270800	the first day of all this, at least, you know, in the bust.
2270800	2271520	Right.
2271520	2273280	But it's still mostly a goo body.
2274080	2276960	But it looks like John Lee Pettymore the third.
2276960	2279680	Oh, it's, uh, it's good to see.
2279680	2280960	I haven't seen that face in a while.
2280960	2283280	That's a, that's a good, that's a good.
2283280	2283520	Yeah.
2283520	2284400	Well, shut up, baby.
2284400	2284720	I know.
2287200	2291840	A fifth, a fifth Keith comes in behind John and pushes him into the group hug.
2293520	2294800	John breaks down.
2294800	2297600	He hugs back, but he's just like heaving.
2297600	2300000	You can't hear him crying, but he's just convulsing.
2300000	2300320	Yeah.
2300320	2306800	Uh, the extra Keith's fade away and it's just the three, the three of us group hugging.
2306800	2313200	And then Keith steps back and, well, if you're gonna, if you're gonna stay here, John, what
2313200	2313840	are you gonna do?
2314400	2315440	I'm of this world.
2316880	2321600	I think I might try to go back through one of those doors and see where the next ones
2321600	2321840	lead.
2322400	2327200	Will we, uh, will we see you again?
2328720	2330640	Keith, you're, you're God.
2331760	2333520	You'll see all of us whenever you want.
2334240	2339040	Well, I know what I'm going to do and I'm going to stay where I go.
2340000	2343680	I don't plan on visiting other worlds or other planes.
2346080	2349920	Is there, is there anything I can do for you guys before I go?
2351520	2352800	Is there anything you want?
2352800	2354640	Uh, the overseer steps up.
2354640	2360080	Well, um, if you're, uh, if you're offering, I feel like my job's kind of done.
2360080	2362880	I think I might be in for a reward of some sort.
2363520	2368080	Is that, can I ask you to, you kind of control reality now, right?
2368080	2373360	As far as I understand it in the past 45 seconds to two minutes.
2373360	2373600	Yeah.
2374240	2378880	I think, I think you can, uh, you can, can you, can you slot me in somewhere where I'm
2378880	2383680	a, I'm like a, like a detective from like those books or movies.
2384320	2386720	I want to be a noir style detective somewhere.
2387280	2394000	I don't know if this sounds, uh, I don't know if this sounds up your alley, but, uh, I've
2394000	2394800	got an idea.
2395920	2396640	Do you trust me?
2398160	2398640	Sure.
2398640	2400000	Of course we did.
2400000	2400960	We did it together.
2400960	2401520	Yeah.
2401520	2405360	Come with me and, uh, we'll be happy.
2406320	2406640	All right.
2406640	2412720	And Keith reaches out his hand to the overseer and three up and down handshake.
2412720	2417280	And then he motions them to like, just like stand right beside it.
2417280	2418880	Wait real fast before we go.
2418880	2423120	And, uh, the overseer is going to do a, uh, something he's going to do a spell or something
2423120	2424720	to send the liturgy.
2424720	2429600	Uh, he wants to drop them doing their chance and send them back to where they are from.
2430240	2430560	Okay.
2430560	2440480	So as soon as the liturgy breaks and the chanting whispers have dissipated.
2441200	2442480	Thanks for all your help, everyone.
2442960	2443600	Good show.
2443600	2444800	Clark Bishop.
2444800	2445600	Oh my God.
2446160	2447040	Oh my God.
2447040	2450800	Gary Daley falls to his knees and just begins weeping.
2450800	2451520	Endlessly.
2455280	2455840	Harry.
2463200	2467280	A Keith pops up behind him and starts like just kind of rubbing his shoulders a little
2467280	2467840	bit.
2467840	2468960	I can't go on.
2468960	2469920	I can't do it.
2470800	2471200	Gary.
2471200	2474880	I'm, I'm, I'm terribly sorry that we can, we can save Henry.
2474880	2476720	That's a Harry.
2476720	2477440	Oh fuck.
2479200	2486160	And he grabs, he grabs, uh, he grabs onto your uniform, the shoulders on both sides
2486160	2493280	and gets real fistfuls of cloth, you know, on either side and just buries his face into
2493280	2494000	your chest.
2494000	2496880	It was like that old turkey.
2496880	2498240	Next name was Harry.
2499200	2500000	I'm, I'm sorry.
2500000	2502800	It's been, it's been a century since I've seen him.
2502800	2503680	I'm sorry about that.
2505120	2508240	He's mine and I can't do it without him.
2508240	2512320	And he, uh, he looks up into your eyes with just plea.
2513120	2516560	If you're going to take me somewhere, can you take me where he's there?
2516560	2517600	Yeah, yeah.
2517600	2519280	We, uh, I look over at Keith.
2519280	2521360	Yeah, we can, we can, we can do that.
2521360	2523920	That's, that's something I can do and he can do it together.
2523920	2525600	We can make sure that for sure happens.
2525600	2526560	He's easy.
2527360	2531280	If I go there and he's there, would I also be there?
2532880	2534720	And Keith puts his hand on his shoulder.
2535840	2541280	Hey, look, Keith reaches out with his hand and in his hand is a little tiny figurine
2541280	2546480	of Harry with a big bowl of pho in his hands.
2547120	2549040	We're all going to a good place.
2549040	2551520	As soon as we get done here, we're going to a good place.
2551520	2553200	Overseer turns to the crowd.
2553680	2559200	As a matter of fact, if anybody, if any, if anybody wants to go anywhere, that's, we can
2559200	2560960	just do that, right?
2560960	2561600	Isn't that right?
2561600	2565120	I think we can, I think we can just send you back to a better place.
2565120	2566560	Keith roll unarmed combat.
2566560	2568560	Oh, what?
2572960	2573520	64.
2576480	2577680	Pretty sure that's a fail.
2578640	2579120	Yeah.
2579120	2587440	Mildred Mitchell catches you with a sneak attack from behind puts her tiny frail old
2587440	2593520	lady arms around your neck from the back and she's trying to choke you out.
2593520	2605920	10 Keith's pop out and gently remove her.
2610160	2620160	And then until the bee pops up in front of her and they just run to each other and embrace
2620160	2623200	in this dim, dim light of this world.
2623200	2627360	And the till they be like looks around at all the other case and does a shrug.
2633440	2635040	Wait, so it's just, it's just key.
2635040	2636320	It's just fucking key.
2636320	2636820	Yeah.
2641200	2641520	Okay.
2641520	2649280	So Mildred starts hugging her and is like, are you, are you okay?
2649280	2653600	Um, I'm super okay.
2655360	2658880	Grandma role persuade weirdo.
2662080	2676560	That's a success or the 57 on a 60 and Mildred is so happy and relieved to finally be reunited
2677040	2679440	with her granddaughter till DB Mitchell.
2679440	2680560	Keith looks at him.
2680560	2685040	Hey, you guys have got a place in, uh, at my place.
2685040	2686160	Same as the overseer.
2686160	2691440	Same as anybody else here that doesn't want to go back to their, their plane.
2691440	2694320	I'm going to let that persuade roll over.
2694320	2697840	Yes, we can be together.
2697840	2699680	We can be a family again.
2701840	2702640	Jack Pearlman.
2707200	2707700	Jack.
2712080	2715120	Jack Pearlman, Everett pace.
2715920	2723120	Look at each other and also see Greer Hilfintop Kermunker now and a bartender and a piano
2723120	2725120	player and a gambler named Thomas.
2725120	2728240	They're all from the same time period and contention.
2728240	2729680	They all recognize each other.
2730720	2734560	You're saying I can go anywhere that I want.
2734560	2737280	Don't have to be back where I came from.
2737280	2739200	Yeah, I think that's what we're saying.
2739200	2742240	I think, I think we can get you, get you set up any way you want.
2742880	2749680	I used to have a ranch with the, with all these horses and I just love, love just a
2749680	2754960	big old ranch with a big old herd of horses that need tendon to that I can take care of
2754960	2761440	surrounded by beautiful nature, lakes, a seller full of good whiskey, couple of dogs to keep
2761440	2764640	me company, a room devoted to all kinds of good books.
2764640	2767040	I think that's a life I could love.
2767040	2768400	Keith speaks up.
2768960	2770000	What was your name again?
2770640	2771760	Jack Pearlman.
2771760	2772260	Jack.
2773840	2777360	Jack, if you come with me, I can give you, I can give you everything you want.
2778000	2779520	Everett comes toddling up.
2779520	2784320	Hey, uh, Jack, uh, that sounds pretty nice.
2784320	2788080	You think maybe I could have a, have a little shack out there on the edge of your property?
2788080	2789840	I think that'd do just fine Everett.
2789840	2793600	Hey Everett, have you ever wanted more than a shack?
2793600	2794400	Oh, hell no.
2794400	2795600	I just want my shack.
2795600	2796560	Duly nobody.
2796560	2798560	It's what I contend to is what I like.
2801120	2808160	Oh yes, and I would very much like, uh, some sort of building where I could do my workouts
2808160	2811040	and squash the watermelons with my thighs.
2811040	2812080	Come with me.
2812080	2813200	My name is Greer.
2814240	2817120	I don't, I didn't ask what your name was, but, uh.
2817760	2820240	Yeah, he just promised you watermelons, man.
2820240	2821440	He didn't ask the fuck you were.
2821440	2826800	Hint up your monger now, and I will, if you are willing to, to furnish watermelons for
2826800	2827300	me.
2828240	2832480	As I said, Jack over here, if you come with me, I can give you whatever you want.
2832480	2833200	Okay.
2833200	2838080	Everett turns around to the Thomas the gambler and the bartender and piano player.
2839280	2841200	You guys are welcome to come with us.
2841200	2844800	You're, you're, you're, you're part of our career as far as I'm concerned.
2844880	2850160	Oh yeah, I sure, I sure would like to come with y'all if we could get some sort of tavern
2850160	2850560	set up.
2850560	2851520	Sir, what's your name?
2851520	2853200	Oh, my name's Sparkin.
2853200	2853920	Sparkin?
2855360	2856000	What do you want?
2856880	2857920	Oh, you know me?
2857920	2861440	I just love having a, having a bar to slide glass down, you know?
2865600	2868960	If you come with me, you can slide glass all day and all night.
2868960	2870160	Oh, I like the sound of that.
2870160	2874720	And he slaps the piano player on the back and is like, Hey, does that mean that I, that
2875680	2878480	it'll be a piano there for me to tickle the fun, tickle the, tickle the operates?
2880880	2887200	Keith has a, another Keith pop up in front of him and like get down on all fours and
2887200	2888800	Keith steps up on his back.
2890240	2894480	Anybody here that wants to come with me, you'll have a place.
2896240	2898800	Anything you want, I can give to you.
2898800	2902080	If you come with me, gesture over to Clark.
2902800	2906000	So, uh, make your decision.
2906000	2907520	I guess I won't be mad.
2907520	2908400	He won't be mad.
2909040	2915600	This is that scene in every dog movie where the bad guy and the main characters stand
2915600	2918560	on opposite sides and like call the dog for them.
2918560	2919060	Yeah.
2919600	2926400	And in this case, we've got a raccoon, a chunk kitty, a distinguished gray dog and old chunky
2926400	2927600	proud chipmunk.
2928400	2934880	We've got Tyler, the excitable black lab, a friendly woodpecker, an old gray squirrel,
2934880	2936080	a golden retriever.
2936080	2937600	Bean is there as well.
2938160	2945840	Salem, the cat's body has been mewing constantly at the radio, just pawing at the radio and
2945840	2949600	mewing over and over Archie and taco joined the group as well.
2949600	2956080	And that whole mess of fun time, content your contention, create a career coalition
2957200	2961840	animals all swarm toward Keith Clark.
2961840	2969120	I stepped down from the Keith that's bent over and motion you toward to like step up
2969120	2969920	on there.
2969920	2971360	Please call me, call me overseer.
2972560	2974000	I'm no, I'm no longer Clark.
2974880	2975380	Over.
2979040	2987520	Keith, uh, rolls his eyes a little bit, but he's like, uh, well, I've, I've said my piece,
2987520	2990240	uh, overseer say what you must.
2991760	2993600	I'm going to need your help here, Keith.
2993600	2994100	Yeah.
2994480	2995680	Everybody ready?
2995680	2999280	We're going to send you Clara Blankenship and Casey Kristoff.
2999360	3001280	The only two that I haven't mentioned yet.
3001280	3007840	Also go and join the group that is standing over by the Keith's who's in a Clark slash
3007840	3009600	overseers group.
3009600	3013040	I don't, I don't picture us dividing like that.
3013040	3013600	Do you?
3013600	3018960	Uh, no, but that's, what's funny is that Keith is seeing as, as a competition and everyone
3018960	3022560	goes to Keith side and he just looks at you at this smug face.
3023280	3023780	Okay.
3024560	3025760	Yeah, they're all this fucking eyes.
3026240	3030720	I guess they all, I guess they went with God.
3032160	3035040	Your wife kissed me on the cheek earlier tonight.
3035040	3036400	Wait, what is that from?
3036400	3038800	I think you should leave and look at you now.
3039840	3042400	Everyone's coming to party in my house.
3046880	3050240	I will say, uh, I was not picturing it like that at all.
3050240	3053520	I was thinking like, if you want to go back to your old life, go with him.
3054160	3059040	If you want to follow a, uh, have you heard of Jesus, a Jesus like character?
3059040	3059600	Come with me.
3063440	3067360	Overseer has been in concert with you because I think that the deal is that the overseer
3067360	3070640	is going to be able to help like create portals, but you're the one who's going to be able
3070640	3072080	to create realities.
3072080	3072580	Yeah.
3073280	3076160	The Clark is staying here to wait his time in the tower.
3076160	3076960	What's Don doing?
3076960	3077920	What's John doing?
3077920	3082640	He's rolling off almost into the sunset on planet juggernaut, but he looks down at
3082640	3088160	Don as he passes and he says, uncle Don, you've been in this world a lot longer than
3088160	3092400	me and I plan on bringing some law to it.
3093280	3097360	You want to ride the juggernaut across these cosmic planes with me?
3097360	3101680	Don like formally crumpled over hugging the thing.
3101680	3107440	Did not know that you were John because he thought the John he was with was the John.
3108240	3110240	Oh, Hey, there were three of us, bud.
3110240	3114000	Hearing the voice because he's heard it so many times come from the spheres.
3114000	3118400	Now he's like, you're a hell yeah boy.
3118400	3118880	Hell yeah.
3118880	3121200	And he's like, starts like getting super pumped.
3121200	3127360	He puts the wand into his pants pocket and like runs up to the planet juggernaut and
3127360	3130000	he's like, let's bring some law to this lawless land.
3130640	3131520	Yeah, fuck yeah.
3131520	3140000	And whose arm shoots down from like high atop planet juggernaut and your nephew, your
3140000	3146640	whose nephew like flings you up on top next to him and together you top planet juggernaut
3147520	3148640	into the sunset.
3148640	3149140	Yes.
3150720	3153520	Oh, I want to read that comic.
3153520	3162320	Oh my God, brother Nick Nichols is that planet juggernaut about to head the fuck out of here
3162320	3163920	out into the sunset forever?
3163920	3169280	My brother, it does appear he's heading off into a sort of sunset if I had to put a word
3169280	3169760	to it.
3169760	3170400	Oh my God.
3170400	3175120	Well, before he quite leaves, let's go ahead and get our question in.
3175120	3176320	They keep calling him Keith.
3176320	3178000	What do you think about this fellow so far?
3178000	3181280	Now, is this the Keith that we like or is this another Keith?
3181280	3186160	I would say that we definitely like this one because he seems to be granting people's
3186160	3188640	wishes and my wish to this Keith.
3188640	3189840	Are you listening Keith?
3189840	3190800	Hundreds of voices.
3194640	3202160	I don't know about you Nick, but for me personally, I would love for Richard Dick Nichols to join
3202160	3206880	us here of this very last treasurable time in our lives.
3206880	3208480	What do you think about getting them here?
3208560	3210880	The wildest versions of them that are-
3210880	3216640	I'd love to get all of the family back together.
3217520	3223600	As you're talking and looking at each other, you can see on either of your necks, something
3223600	3227200	start to like kind of start poking out.
3227200	3229120	Oh my goodness.
3229120	3230720	Oh, heavens.
3230720	3232160	Oh, Dick Nichols.
3232160	3232880	Is that you?
3233680	3235280	I believe it is, brother.
3235280	3238240	Haven't seen you in forever, my dear.
3238240	3240960	Oh, clasp hands with me, brother.
3240960	3242560	Oh, yes.
3242560	3244880	And our hands are tiny little hands that are what?
3244880	3245840	Poking out of skin?
3245840	3251440	No, your heads just grow like on your neck and shoulder.
3251440	3253200	So you're like two-headed.
3253200	3255040	Should we nuzzle our-
3255040	3255540	Yes.
3256480	3258240	Oh, nuzzle with me, brother.
3258240	3260800	Yes, our nipples will touch forever.
3261760	3267840	You know, when I first heard those characters, I thought they were just, you know, like British
3268640	3271920	or something, you know, like all the classic movie villains.
3271920	3275920	But then I realized they were actually queer coded, like all the classic movie villains.
3276480	3280640	So aren't you the classic movie villains, Zack and Justin?
3280640	3283920	I would say that we're the heroes of this story, my dear.
3283920	3286160	Oh, everyone thinks different.
3286160	3288080	They don't know what they're talking about.
3288160	3290720	Oh, this simpleton talking to us.
3290720	3292080	Oh, my goodness.
3292080	3293600	He knows none of what he speaks.
3294160	3298000	Well, I personally think it's really nice to have the nickel nickels.
3298000	3303600	There's all the four nickels, quad nickels, all together here, coming up right now.
3303600	3305760	We're all walking up here, all playing and jogging on.
3305760	3307120	Oh, my goodness.
3307120	3307920	Oh, look at him.
3307920	3308960	He's round.
3308960	3310400	He's round, brother.
3310400	3312640	He's a round bound of something, I tell you.
3313680	3314320	I want to work.
3315440	3317120	Wait, what do you want to do?
3318080	3322160	Well, what are we going to do now?
3322160	3324800	Should we ask him if we could come with him?
3324800	3325440	Hold on.
3325440	3328960	He holds both his microphones out and walks directly towards them.
3329600	3330560	Nick walks out.
3330560	3331200	Ting, ting, ting.
3332560	3334800	Mr. Juggernaut.
3334800	3337280	So Goo John feels like a tug at his shoulder.
3337840	3340400	And it's this little tendril from Planet Juggernaut.
3341040	3345520	And they stopped their dramatic mosey into the sunset.
3346480	3347680	And John looks down.
3347760	3349840	And he sees the nickels far below him.
3350720	3354880	And there's this little Planet Juggernaut tendril right next to him in the shape of
3354880	3358960	a hand with its finger out, given the just a minute hand gesture.
3360000	3361600	What do you need, boys?
3362320	3362960	Ask him, Nick.
3363920	3365520	I don't know if I can, Nick.
3365520	3366320	Oh, come on.
3366320	3367760	I bet you can do it.
3367760	3369920	Oh, we believe you must do it.
3371280	3371780	Okay.
3373040	3374160	Do you think we could...
3374160	3377280	I'm holding both the microphones up, and I'm pressing them against him.
3378640	3382640	Can we follow you and, like, you do stuff and we say stuff in the microphone?
3382640	3383840	Ellie, talk about it.
3385040	3387520	Follow me, boys.
3388160	3391680	And then a little, like, vacuum hose comes out.
3392560	3396160	And the microphones are ripped out of your hands.
3396160	3399520	And almost the skin is nearly ripped off your hands.
3400240	3402480	And then you are sucked into Planet Juggernaut.
3407840	3410480	Okay, Jon, we can go.
3410480	3416800	But before you really can go, this whole time, Drew Andrews has been making his way
3417440	3423440	assertively out toward Planet Juggernaut and Jon to say one final farewell.
3424080	3424800	Jon sees it.
3424800	3425840	He doesn't need...
3425840	3428800	He sees Drew strutting out towards him.
3428800	3429600	Oh, nay.
3431280	3431680	Whoa.
3438400	3439440	Horse things.
3440320	3442000	Hold on, Planet Juggernaut.
3442560	3447040	Do you have any cool BDSM stuff on Planet Juggernaut to, like, hold on?
3448000	3448800	Like horses have?
3449920	3453040	Horses do have cool BDSM stuff on, don't they?
3453040	3454560	I never thought of it that way.
3454560	3455360	Horses are rad.
3456160	3457520	Horses are freaks, yeah.
3462880	3463380	No.
3464400	3465360	Asked and answered.
3466240	3466740	I know.
3467280	3468160	So there is, like...
3468880	3470800	It doesn't look like it's even attached.
3470800	3477200	It's the right size, but it looks so comically small on the top of Planet Juggernaut.
3477200	3483280	But you just have a perfect just, like, cowboy saddle made out of the shifting, starry,
3483280	3488000	ethereal, incandescent, iridescent star, like, muck.
3488000	3488560	Beautiful.
3489840	3490640	It is beautiful.
3490640	3491760	From inside you here.
3493520	3494720	Well, that was wonderful.
3494720	3498720	So, yeah, he pulls on some, like, imaginary reins.
3498720	3500640	He's sitting on the saddle, but there are no reins.
3500640	3503840	He and Planet Juggernaut are pretty much as one.
3503840	3505040	They're both ball.
3505040	3507200	You can't see the tendril going from...
3508160	3508880	Oh, God.
3509920	3510800	Butthole to butthole.
3513760	3515440	Like a merry-go-round horse.
3516320	3517280	But you're the horse.
3518320	3518820	Um...
3519360	3520080	Do you like that?
3520080	3520320	Nope.
3520320	3522240	No, I was thinking more like some kind of...
3525120	3527920	So Drew Andrews joins you on the plane.
3531760	3536080	John, I just wanted to say thank you before you go.
3536960	3537680	For what, Drew?
3538560	3540960	Thank you for always being there for us.
3541680	3542720	You taught me a lot.
3542720	3548560	You taught me how to shoot a gun and how to be a man.
3549440	3553200	And also, some of those lessons were, like,
3553840	3557360	those kinds of lessons where you learn from one another not to do stuff.
3557360	3560240	But I think that you're, like, a really...
3560240	3562320	I think you are always trying your best.
3562320	3563280	And I really...
3563280	3564240	I think that's cool.
3564800	3566560	Hey, I think you're pretty cool too, man.
3569040	3570880	Just remember what I taught you, though.
3573120	3574880	You remember where the clitoris is, right?
3579280	3579920	Adios.
3584000	3586640	Jesus Christ.
3586640	3589120	A beautiful moment and pretending to be me.
3595120	3598160	Unless, Drew, would you want to come with me?
3598160	3604000	Yeah, I think that I have more to learn because I didn't know when you just said that.
3605280	3605920	I don't know.
3606880	3611360	You're gonna have to tell me again as we go.
3612000	3617440	And Agent Trent Catt, the beautiful black cat that was once called Salem,
3617440	3622880	but now is embodied by the spirit of Agent Trent Chad,
3622880	3629600	is running around the ankles and rubbing against the ankles of Drew Andrews.
3629600	3634800	And so Drew picks up this black cat and throws the cat up on his shoulders.
3634800	3638960	And the cat kind of wraps himself around Drew's shoulders.
3639600	3642720	And he's like, what do you say, Agent Trent Catt?
3643840	3644640	No, he can't come.
3644640	3645120	Oh, okay.
3645120	3645920	I'm kidding.
3645920	3646560	Oh, okay.
3647760	3649440	Oh, every time with this guy.
3649440	3652160	Yeah, I mean, like, my brothers used to do stuff like that a lot to me.
3652160	3656560	And I just can't, like, you know, they go out for a cheers with a beer bottle
3656560	3659840	and they whack the top of real hearts so it flows out the top, you know.
3659840	3660320	What?
3660320	3661440	It makes you go out the top?
3662160	3664160	Well, that's yeah.
3664160	3664160	
3665600	3667040	Will you do that to me soon?
3670400	3670880	Okay.
3673760	3674400	It's sad.
3675280	3676560	It's sad how we write.
3677440	3677920	Hold on.
3678560	3679760	I think that was perfect.
3683120	3683920	All right, great.
3683920	3684480	Moving on.
3685360	3687680	That's a series wrap on Drew Andrews, everybody.
3687680	3689360	Oh, yeah.
3689360	3693760	Wow, really good job, Drew.
3693760	3696480	As Planet Juggernaut and friends write off...
3696480	3699360	Get as far away from Jesus, Keith, as they can.
3702080	3703440	Some may ride with that boy.
3704160	3708400	Yeah, I don't trust this messianic message of his.
3708400	3712880	As they write off into the mostly pure darkness,
3712880	3717360	Keith pops the sun up so that they can ride into the sunset.
3717440	3719200	Oh, fuck yeah.
3720160	3726240	And as they do, Keith takes special note of Planet Juggernaut's shape.
3727200	3727760	I like it.
3728320	3728800	Ominous.
3730160	3734080	Well, Clark, I think we're about to get out of here.
3734080	3736960	Are you gonna be okay?
3736960	3739840	Is there anything you need or want from me?
3740720	3742560	He's had a grin on this entire time.
3742560	3746000	This is his own personal wish fulfillment.
3746000	3748960	He's serving this purpose that he's always wanted to.
3750560	3751440	I'm good, guys.
3752640	3756400	I thank you all for your help and I'm gonna thank you 10 times over
3756400	3760640	because I know how this all ends now, but it's good to know at least.
3761840	3762560	I'm happy.
3762560	3763280	I'm good.
3763280	3764640	Well, I'm happy to hear that.
3764640	3770240	And then Keith puts his hand on Clark's shoulder and there's like a sudden,
3770880	3772560	almost like a sound wave or something.
3772880	3777920	Something kind of pushes coming from the tower that you're going to be residing in.
3779280	3787680	And Clark won't know it, but every single cabinet drawer filled with microwave dinners.
3792240	3792640	Yes.
3797920	3799440	But no microwave.
3799440	3801760	Or freezer.
3801760	3803120	So they melt immediately.
3804320	3805760	It's a horror game.
3808400	3809840	Hell in the rotten tower.
3816080	3822240	Keith takes his hand off Clark and gives him, you know, one of those kind of last looks
3822240	3825680	where we both know, like, it might be a while.
3825680	3826720	Solid nod shared.
3827200	3833040	Keith is content knowing Clark's going to find a way to heat these microwave dinners up.
3835040	3838800	Hey, Clark, if you ever need anything from me, like,
3838800	3843520	you ever get hungry and need to eat in 30 seconds, let me know.
3845680	3848320	Clark, if you ever need anything from me, just think it.
3848320	3849040	I'll feel it.
3849040	3852400	You, you, you, you gotta, but I mean, I'm going to need a lot from you eventually,
3852400	3854080	but it's in the past and you've already done it.
3854080	3855120	So it's all, we're all good.
3855120	3855920	Thank you.
3856560	3862960	Keith gives that one last look to Clark and he kind of turns around and looks at the
3865040	3866160	so many last looks.
3869120	3871600	Well, I mean, you know, it's a big moment.
3871600	3873120	It is a, it is a big moment.
3873120	3874400	It's a big moment, Keith.
3874400	3879440	I mean, on the horizon, uh, John, Don and Planet Juggernaut take a last look back at
3879440	3880000	you guys.
3880000	3881840	And John raises his ooze hat.
3886240	3889760	And then Keith Keith's returns to his congregation.
3895280	3896240	Y'all ready?
3896240	3906240	And then they blip out of this existence and they blip into contention, which at this
3906240	3912320	point has been just completely destroyed by, can you Zach, can you give us a quick rundown
3912320	3915280	of why and how contention has been destroyed?
3915280	3918960	Looking over top at the town of contention.
3918960	3920160	We're topping contention.
3922960	3925120	Contention's such a power bottom, guys.
3926800	3934240	This story ends on an unseasonably cold December 6th in a small town called Contention.
3934240	3940240	A snow flurry can be seen under the street lights on an empty country road.
3941440	3944880	I don't want to, I don't want to tell you how to do your job unless it's like super
3944880	3946400	important that it's snowing.
3946400	3948880	Wouldn't it be perfect if it's unseasonably warm?
3949840	3951440	No, I already wrote it all like this.
3953040	3953920	I like it.
3953920	3956560	Was it unseasonably warm when we started playing?
3956560	3960880	Yeah, now it's like I described snow on like half the shit in this.
3962160	3963760	That's me talking about snow.
3963760	3965840	Let's just take out the snow stuff though.
3965840	3966880	Yeah, what if you didn't?
3966880	3967680	What if it was-
3967680	3968180	Okay.
3968640	3969600	Can you rewrite it really quick?
3969600	3970000	You know what?
3970000	3970800	Hey, how about this?
3970800	3971520	Let's try it out.
3971520	3974480	I'm gonna, I'm gonna say what I prepared.
3974880	3976880	We'll plug in no snow.
3976880	3977760	No, I'm gonna, I'm gonna-
3980240	3985680	Every time I say something about snow, you guys all say no snow.
3985680	3985920	Okay?
3986880	3987520	Are you ready?
3987520	3987760	Yeah.
3987760	3989680	That's not, that's not ruin what you've written.
3990480	3992960	Yeah, I want to hear it in its, in its wholeness.
3992960	3994640	Well, you guys aren't playing along.
3994640	3995360	Thomas will fucking do it.
3995360	3995920	I'll play along.
3999360	4003040	This story ends on an unseasonably Jack Pearlman.
4005680	4014560	This story ends on an unseasonably cold December 6th in a small town called the Contention.
4014560	4015520	A snow flurry-
4015520	4016080	No snow.
4016080	4020720	Can be seen under the street lights on an empty country road.
4021520	4027520	A snow flurry is a light snowfall that results in little or no snow accumulation.
4027520	4028400	He said the thing.
4028400	4034320	Ahead, there's a blockade made of splintered church pews obstructing the exit
4034320	4039280	and the sign from Subtropolis has been torn down and spray-painted with instructions.
4039920	4042640	Says detour, please keep right.
4043360	4049200	In the quiet parking lot of Hotel Motel, an empty dunking booth sits alone.
4049200	4054080	The door to Keith's room is open and the door to Keith's safe is open as well,
4054080	4061280	revealing the empty place where he kept the watch he stole from his brother's cold wrist.
4062240	4068320	At the corner of a desolate intersection, the burned-out husk of a truck is wrapped
4068320	4075920	around the base of a billboard for a wild business called Owls, Tires, and Tigers.
4075920	4080720	But the word tiger and the picture of the tiger have both turned to ash,
4080720	4083680	making the business look far more mundane.
4084320	4088240	Out north of town, John Lee Pettymore's house sits abandoned.
4088320	4092640	Two sizable holes had been dug deep into the property.
4092640	4095040	Inside, the house is still a mess.
4095040	4098800	There wasn't much time to clean after Keith turned it inside out,
4098800	4101120	looking for cocaine that was buried.
4101120	4110720	And Thomas, what does any Pettymore who knows anything know about what John left here?
4110720	4113600	Well, John left his millions of dollars.
4114320	4116080	Fives of millions of dollars.
4116880	4120320	Five million dollars hidden somewhere on this property.
4120320	4124000	Across town is a small vacant baseball diamond.
4124000	4127760	Little bits of snow fall and melt on the metal bleachers,
4128400	4133360	which are lit by a concession hut neon sign for the contention trucks.
4133360	4134480	Trucks bring it.
4134480	4135360	Trucks bring it!
4137360	4138480	Trucks bring it!
4138480	4139440	Trucks bring it!
4139440	4146400	Clark Bishop's parents' house exists, barren as ever.
4147280	4154400	Light flickers out the open front door in a way which shows the television is still on.
4154960	4159040	At the twice-forsaken vampire-themed water park, Splashylvania,
4159040	4164160	the spiraling duet of slides that are the two-fanged plunge
4164720	4170480	have been stained brown with the blood of Leo Piston and Julie Maxwell.
4171680	4176480	Curiously, the sign for Klinker's local drinking hole and unrivaled daycare
4176480	4181120	seems to be missing seven letters from its list of happy hour bottle specials.
4181680	4184880	Corona is missing an N, so Coroa.
4185680	4189200	Bush Lite is missing an L, so Bushite.
4189200	4192560	Past Blue Ribbon, which is missing S-T-U-E-N.
4193360	4195360	Pab- Pable Ribbo.
4195360	4196080	Pable Ribbo.
4197280	4198480	I have one, Pable Ribbo.
4198480	4201360	Is it perhaps R-S-T-L-N-E?
4201360	4201920	It is not.
4201920	4205280	It is N-L-S-T-U-E-N.
4206400	4209120	The contention woods are silent.
4209680	4210640	There are no people.
4211360	4212480	There are no animals.
4213120	4217120	There's only a slight chilly breeze pushing on the trees gently
4217680	4221280	as the flurry of snow falls at an angle.
4222240	4222880	No snow.
4225120	4226560	Back in the suburbs.
4226560	4230400	Looking through the busted front window of James the Millworker's house
4230400	4234400	treats the viewer into an empty grand piano.
4234400	4237440	Not a string to be hit with a hammer to be found.
4238080	4242720	However, scratches on the tile leading out the front door
4242720	4248640	show that something heavy and metal was pulled up from a hiding spot
4248640	4253040	under the kitchen floor and dragged out of the house.
4253680	4258560	Over at A Plus Storage, three storage units, G10, G11, and G12
4258560	4263120	sit unlocked, open, and completely empty.
4263120	4269440	The halls of the First Church of Contention are flooded by two feet of water
4269440	4273920	and countless fish swim contentedly from the Sunday School classrooms
4273920	4278080	to the chapel to the baptism tank, which is still filled with water.
4278160	4282160	Alternatively, Chief Maggie Cook's home burned to the ground
4282160	4288720	is just a plot of carbon debris that looks out on a sloppily refilled beans pond
4288720	4292800	next to which lays the lifeless body of Anne Love
4293360	4299120	dressed to die in an emerald green suit with a black silk bow tie.
4299760	4304880	Her face is frozen in a cold, vacant smile
4304880	4309920	behind icy asymmetrical bangs covering one of her eyes
4309920	4315040	and a big chonky fluffer of a snowflake floats down
4315840	4321920	and lands directly on Agent Karen's exposed blood-red eyeball.
4322800	4328720	The delicate solid slowly dissolves, fills the convex reservoir,
4329200	4335200	and a single crimson drop pushes over the edge of the eye-skin basin
4335920	4340800	and runs down the face of the woman who killed Clark Bishop's parents.
4342240	4350000	As we zoom out, we see the knife he plunged well through the top of her shattered skull.
4351040	4355200	And we continue to zoom out over the quiet town of Contention
4355200	4362800	until Keith, he gets everybody that's coming with and just snaps his fingers
4364000	4368560	and they all show up in the pretty much decimated Contention.
4369120	4374160	Keith pops back into hundreds of Keiths and shouts
4375840	4379600	Clean up, clean up, everybody do you share?
4379600	4383360	A montage of... Hell yes!
4384560	4389520	Cleaning montage. How does Jack Pearlman clean, Justin?
4390800	4392800	I mean, handsomely.
4396560	4399280	We can all agree on that. Whatever he's doing, it looks good.
4399280	4404240	I picture Everett Pace like fully hunched over but going like a million miles an hour.
4406080	4409200	Does he have like a little tiny broom with a dust pan?
4410000	4413040	No, yeah, I was gonna say he's not going 100 miles an hour.
4413040	4418240	He's actually really focused on like one little patch of dirt that he can handle himself.
4419600	4421680	Get this right in here, alright?
4421680	4428480	You literally get one little like intersection median just looking fucking excellent.
4428480	4429600	You could eat off of this here.
4430560	4433120	It's grass and dirt and like flowers and shit.
4433760	4437440	As the sun goes down, Keith pops back into one Keith and
4438000	4444560	Okay, it's probably about six more days of this and then we'll be set in Keith tension.
4445200	4447840	Rinse and repeat for six more days and then...
4447840	4455120	Okay, so during this time a few people have heard tell that you are giving away things.
4456160	4458640	Your reward, yeah, you're giving away wishes, of course.
4458640	4460880	Thank you for rebuilding Keith tension.
4460880	4462640	Exactly. Fucking great.
4462640	4465680	You've got like a campaign slogan, there's signs up.
4465760	4466640	Keith Vermeer.
4467600	4468400	Already?
4468400	4474560	Well, first off, Gary Daley is going to approach Keith with enormous eyes and a sort of reverence.
4475280	4477920	He almost bows as he holds up.
4477920	4478960	Don't be silly.
4478960	4484160	He holds up this figurine of Harry Klinker that you gave him.
4485040	4491280	I've been working real hard for the past four days and we only got two more to go and I know
4491280	4496960	Harry'd be real good at working alongside us and getting Keith tension all up and ready to go.
4496960	4499600	If you could, if you could do me that favor.
4499600	4500800	You want me to bring him back?
4501360	4503040	Well, I want one.
4504160	4505600	I know that's bad.
4505600	4513200	I know that that means that I'm taking him from one of me, but I'm me and I want, I want one.
4513200	4513920	Can I have one?
4515920	4517760	I don't see how anything could go wrong.
4517760	4518240	Yeah, no.
4519120	4519620	Okay.
4520000	4521680	Keith thinks real hard.
4521680	4525920	Oh wait, can you give me one that was like really close to like the same kind of world
4525920	4530000	that I lived in where all this stuff went nutty, but then like at the last minute, maybe he's like
4530720	4533760	saved and different or maybe one where I'm dead.
4533760	4534640	Oh, that'd be good.
4534640	4535520	One where I'm dead.
4535520	4536880	Keith's like, yeah, sure.
4536880	4539920	But it's just the first one that opens up.
4539920	4541680	He gets that, gets that one.
4541680	4542080	Okay.
4542080	4544400	So do you want to roll for me?
4544400	4544800	Yeah.
4544800	4545120	Okay.
4545120	4550320	So what is, what would be good for me and what would be numbers?
4550320	4553200	A one out of 100 shot that this is a good.
4553200	4554480	You tell me numbers.
4554480	4556800	Any number or like a range of numbers?
4556800	4561040	I would say any number will do, but that would mean the range.
4561040	4562640	Like I roll under a certain thing.
4562640	4569280	Oh, under 49, under 50 or over 50.
4571920	4572240	Okay.
4572240	4574400	So under 50 is good.
4574400	4575280	Under 50 is good.
4575280	4575780	Okay.
4577760	4578260	Fuck.
4578720	4579280	92.
4579920	4580160	Okay.
4580160	4581120	So shitty.
4581120	4582160	The world that opens up.
4582160	4583520	This is what it feels like to be a player.
4583520	4584080	And I hate it.
4584080	4585120	The world that opens up.
4586000	4586880	Welcome to hell.
4586880	4591040	They, they are super close with each other.
4591920	4597600	Nothing bad has really happened in their lives until one day.
4597600	4598000	Okay.
4603280	4609840	Keith just shows up, grabs him off the sofa, blips back and it puts him in key tension.
4610800	4612400	Harry, Harry.
4612400	4613520	I miss you so much.
4614080	4616480	What the oh, oh no.
4617120	4617840	Oh shit.
4618640	4619680	I rolled sanity.
4621200	4621840	11.
4621840	4622800	Chris success.
4622800	4625680	Harry clinker completely understands the situation.
4626160	4628000	God, God, that's you.
4628000	4628400	Keith.
4628400	4629200	You can call me Keith.
4629200	4629760	Oh my God.
4629760	4630960	Little hot dog boy.
4630960	4632640	What little hot dog became God.
4635920	4637680	What kind of sick world you bring me into?
4637680	4638880	I like this a whole lot.
4638880	4639920	Hey, Hey.
4639920	4641280	This worked out so well.
4641280	4641920	Oh my God.
4641920	4642640	You rolled bad.
4642640	4643200	I wrote good.
4643200	4645920	Hey, I love that.
4645920	4647280	Can we open up clinkers here?
4647280	4648800	That way we can get a good time rolling.
4648800	4653760	I've snapped my fingers in a hundred Keith's instantly rebuild clinker.
4653760	4654260	Fuck.
4656640	4657760	Daycare's open.
4662160	4667920	Mildred Mitchell comes in hot, dragging her Tildy B Mitchell by the ear.
4667920	4673680	This Tildy B is now wearing a pair of big bull britches.
4674720	4680800	And Mildred looks at this Keith and is like, you're going to make this right?
4680800	4681440	How?
4681440	4681920	I can.
4683840	4685440	This is you, right?
4685520	4686640	I can get you.
4688000	4690960	I can get you your Tildy.
4690960	4692480	You did what to my daughter?
4692480	4693760	And then you do this?
4693760	4695280	Do you know what happened to your daughter?
4695840	4697920	She starts crying immediately.
4697920	4704080	Let's go of this fucking Keith, pushes her away, falls to her knees and starts crying
4704080	4704880	onto the ground.
4704880	4710080	I saw what happened, what you did to her.
4710080	4710720	She's okay.
4711600	4712400	I'll show you.
4713040	4716240	And he, uh, gets her Tildy.
4716240	4717520	You fucking piece of shit.
4717520	4718640	Oh my God.
4719440	4720160	All right.
4720160	4723360	Ask and ye shall receive, Mildred.
4723360	4724000	Oh no.
4725360	4730240	I love when given the chance to be a good person with godlike powers, Keith is still
4730240	4735280	like, what could I possibly do to make this person be happier?
4735280	4736880	I don't understand emotion.
4736880	4744720	It makes a lot of sense to me that once there were infinite keys, he understood so much
4744720	4745040	less.
4747440	4754880	Walking through this portal is a skeletal creature with skin so thin, her bones protrude
4754880	4755680	into view.
4755680	4764320	Her nail beds are empty, bruises and lesions cover her body and with pure hatred in her
4764320	4768560	eyes, Tildy B. Mitchell shrieks.
4776640	4779920	Okay, I'm gonna try some magic on her.
4781920	4786720	And he like kind of reaches his hand out and as you reach your hand out, go ahead and roll.
4787680	4788960	That's a thorny vine.
4790640	4791680	Yeah, that's a success.
4791680	4796640	So what happens to her skin and body to make her look normal again?
4796640	4798960	Fingernails grow back immediately.
4798960	4799680	It's a great start.
4802080	4806640	Her skin plumps up, gets some color to it.
4807200	4809520	Her hair quickly grows out.
4809520	4811360	It's almost too long now.
4816640	4817520	You're doing great.
4817520	4818080	You're doing great.
4818080	4819200	What else happened to her?
4819600	4829760	Her scream turns into like a little girl's cry and everything else is better.
4835600	4841520	The two of them run off in a warm embrace, crying and speaking to each other like they
4841520	4842560	haven't in days.
4842560	4843440	You're welcome.
4844320	4849920	The old west folk get their saloon.
4849920	4856560	Everett Pace gets his little shack at the edge of a vast tract of land owned and roamed
4856560	4858640	by one Jack Pearlman.
4861360	4866800	The sun is hitting the dew on the long grass of this pasture and you see a couple horses
4867440	4874000	and you see, you see, uh, Oh my God, my brain doesn't work right now.
4874000	4875840	Are you trying to say Jack Pearlman?
4875840	4876480	Jack Pearlman.
4876480	4876980	God.
4878880	4881680	We're all like sitting here like, is he going to fucking say?
4883680	4884180	I'm blue.
4885120	4885920	Teasing you guys.
4887840	4891760	You see Jack Pearlman riding on his horse past the little shack.
4891760	4893520	He looks very content.
4893520	4894320	Shun.
4894320	4900720	And he's like morning Everett and Everett's out there on, on his, his parcel in the yard
4900720	4902720	there in his long John's.
4902720	4907760	And, uh, he's, he, he had just gotten out of a tub of water that he had been bathing
4907760	4908260	in.
4909040	4913680	And, uh, the, uh, the top of the long John's is hanging off and he's all skin and hunched
4913680	4914480	over bones.
4914480	4919200	And, Oh, Hey, Hey Jackie, you just, you just caught me in the, I was getting out of the
4919200	4919700	tub.
4920320	4922480	Thanks again for this plot of land here.
4923200	4925920	This is, this is, this is what this is all I ever dreamed of.
4925920	4927280	Anytime Everett.
4927280	4928400	Anytime.
4928400	4933360	He gets back to buttoning up his, uh, long John's and he's, he's going to go back inside
4933360	4937120	and, uh, go and check the stock down in his, uh, his root cellar there.
4937120	4939040	He's living a simple life out there.
4939040	4940240	Investing in stocks.
4941040	4941540	Yeah.
4943360	4945200	S T A L K S
4950160	4950660	Nice.
4951060	4955700	And finally, Luke, tell me what Keith has been up to.
4955700	4963060	Um, he stands at the, is it pulpit pulpit, pulpit, pulpit.
4963060	4972180	He's got a choir of Keith's off to the side, kind of singing like that behind him is stained
4972180	4978980	glass with various depictions of Keith, his dog beans, some other characters.
4978980	4979480	Oh yeah.
4979480	4983320	You know, so many other story of Keith in stained glass.
4983320	4983560	Yeah.
4983560	4986280	But everybody kind of looks like Keith a little bit.
4986280	4986780	Yeah.
4987480	4996920	Even beans kind of looks like a man face dog, man face dog.
4996920	4998520	That's the villain of the next season.
4999480	5000600	And yeah, the camera.
5000600	5012920	Pans, pans, pans, the camera pans to the pews and it's filled with everybody that came
5012920	5016040	back to contention and a lot of people that kind of look like Keith.
5016600	5018200	There were a bunch of people from the city too.
5018200	5021960	So they would all be here from the city and Keith's up there like, yeah.
5021960	5026520	So that's basically how, um, how this all happened.
5026520	5029800	Uh, you guys have any questions for me?
5030600	5037080	Then we pan up and out of the first church of contention and we see the sign that says
5037720	5039560	welcome to Keith tension.
5040520	5045320	I've got right here something I'm calling the loose threads montage.
5047160	5049160	Are you ready for the loose threads montage?
5049160	5050680	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
5050680	5052920	You could have called it a cop out.
5056360	5058040	We didn't have any loose threads, did we?
5060600	5063960	It's going to be a short segment.
5068200	5069800	Loose threads montage!
5069800	5073000	Loose threads in the world's tightest RPG podcast.
5076760	5082600	Two United States senators stood arms crossed behind a thick pane of glass.
5082600	5084440	Oh wait, it's threads we never even touched?
5084440	5091960	This is acts like, Hey idiots, here's the parts of the game you never, you could have
5091960	5094520	met senators, you fucking morons.
5094520	5097080	But like, Nope.
5097080	5101560	He did say every time, you know, he's like, I've got these characters and they're moving
5101560	5102440	while you're moving.
5102440	5104840	And if you interact with them, that's what happens.
5104840	5107640	But otherwise they're still following their own agendas.
5107640	5109960	We just didn't know it included the fucking president.
5109960	5111720	Two United States senators.
5111720	5113480	We could have called the president.
5115320	5125800	They stood arms crossed behind a thick pane of glass as they watched an entire lab full
5125800	5132280	of gaunt, tall men in white lab coats over black suits work with unnatural efficiency.
5133000	5137880	And one said to the other, so that's what I've been trying to convey to you.
5137880	5140840	I'm not saying you have to vote yes on the bill.
5141480	5146280	These things are telling you that you have to vote yes on the bill or they'll kill you
5146280	5147400	and your husband.
5147400	5152600	You remember that couple, that bar corp guy's parents, they were found at home with their
5152600	5153560	head smashed in.
5153560	5157720	That's what William and Lena beans got for having spines.
5157720	5163640	So now, and he kept talking as all these translucent skinned lab coated creatures, one by one,
5163640	5167960	began popping and morphing into myriad types of Keiths.
5167960	5172520	And just as suddenly they each blipped out of existence entirely.
5173800	5180760	We zoom into the back wall of this now empty lab and focus in on the myriad logo, four
5180760	5186040	double helices forming a capital M as in myriad.
5186040	5194280	And the M logo fades and reveals an ink M formed by a typewriter that has also finished
5194280	5196760	the name that follows, which is Marvin.
5196760	5203480	We're in a dark smoky room and a shaky pair of hands has just placed a transparency of
5203480	5210760	this file on the glass family crime boss on a dusty old overhead projector.
5210760	5214760	A grumbling man says, Marvin Glass is dead.
5215480	5220760	The other voices in the room, rhubarb, peas and carrots, and someone says, who will take
5220760	5221560	over the business?
5222120	5230120	And the same shaky hands replace Marvin Glass's overhead sheet with one that shows a picture
5230680	5235320	of Keith's genius niece, Francis beans.
5235320	5241960	This picture of Francis on the wall of this murky room morphs into the bloated lifeless
5241960	5249880	face of the Francis beans you all left to drown face down in Marvin Glass's fish tank.
5249880	5257480	But the long wobbly fingers of a strangely shaped woman and wonky goggles slowly tap
5258200	5261320	against this corpse currently dead face.
5262040	5270200	With her other hand of equally long wobbly fingers, this mad scientist types out a to
5270200	5276920	do list in her phone's notes, which is like a notebook, but on your phone.
5277880	5288440	And she types to do kill Kennedy, kill Harrison, kill McKinley.
5289720	5291800	Triangle shape screen wipe!
5291800	5297480	Agent McKinley, the old man with dead eyes, is secured to a chair by his straight jacket
5297480	5299960	in the middle of a small padded room.
5300040	5308120	The door opens and agents Kennedy and Harrison on either side make way for Donovan Westhaven
5308120	5311000	in a new black suit.
5311000	5318120	Donovan walks up to the room's threshold, raises his pistol, fires, and the three agents
5318120	5324600	walk away down a hall and into a spacious, well decorated office.
5326840	5329320	A woman welcomes you into her office.
5329320	5335640	She has shoulder length, curly hair, and a mouth that not only takes up half of her face,
5335640	5341080	it is showing an amount of unbridled pleasure you can barely comprehend.
5341880	5343240	Donovan!
5343240	5345800	We're almost out of these code names.
5345800	5352680	So go ahead and choose between Agent Taylor or Agent Garfield.
5352680	5353960	I guess I'll be Taylor.
5353960	5355880	Agent Taylor it is!
5355880	5356920	Okie dokie!
5357320	5359480	Okie dokie, yeah.
5359480	5363800	Your next mission is to retrieve a missing person!
5363800	5364300	Yay!
5365160	5371560	And she opens up a folder to reveal a picture of the man who disappeared at his daughter's
5371560	5374840	funeral, Stan Manstein.
5375560	5382200	Cut to Stan Manstein as he picks up the receiver of a phone and begins talking into it.
5382200	5385880	Cut to whatever is on the other end of that phone.
5386120	5389560	That would be the Myriad in Keith's body.
5389560	5390360	Yes.
5390360	5391560	That's in a cage.
5391560	5391960	Yes.
5391960	5393560	Forced to answer that phone.
5393560	5394200	Where?
5394200	5396520	In the contention police department.
5396520	5397640	The Keith tension?
5397640	5400600	The Keith tension keith department.
5404600	5411240	That Myriad that's trapped in Keith's body is in a cage in the Keith tension police department
5411240	5412920	and it answers the phone.
5412920	5420120	It writes down notes into a notebook, rips off the page, and hands it, pokes it through
5420760	5428280	one of the small holes of its cage to the noir overseer here in Keith tension.
5432040	5433160	What does he look like?
5433800	5435560	I mean, picture a noir detective.
5435560	5438600	He's wearing it because that's what he did when he designed it.
5438600	5439640	I don't know what that means.
5440200	5445320	That's exactly how he did it when he put together this costume.
5446680	5452120	It's a long trench coat with a fedora and just a button-down shirt with a tie that's already
5452840	5455480	haphazardly tied around his neck.
5456440	5458280	He's already had a day, it looks like.
5458920	5459880	He's got stubble.
5461160	5465320	Yeah, this is the overseer as a noir style detective.
5465320	5466360	Yep, I love it.
5466360	5466840	You love it.
5466840	5467720	We're all here for it.
5467720	5468840	This is his reward.
5470520	5476040	He takes the piece of paper out of this myriad's hand that's still in the form of Keith for
5476040	5477960	some fucking reason and in this cage.
5477960	5479960	No one will ever see him anyway, it doesn't matter.
5479960	5484360	Blips out to solve his case in a blink of blinding light.
5485160	5487880	Okay, yeah, so contention is rebuilt.
5487880	5490280	Everybody is having a great time.
5490280	5491320	Seemingly happy, yeah.
5491320	5496200	I've granted wishes to anyone that asked them of me to the best of my ability.
5496200	5499400	Everybody's having a great time in this weird
5500440	5500440	
5501400	5509320	Every time the overseer gets back from one of his cases, he describes it to Keith, who
5509320	5511560	is doing a true crime podcast.
5511560	5515400	Do you do the podcast live every Sunday from the pulpit?
5515400	5518920	Yes, yes, it's recorded and mandatory.
5522120	5527720	In order to be a citizen of Keith Tension, you have to go to story time on Sunday night.
5527720	5529080	Oh my God.
5529720	5534440	Um, and after, you know, a few weeks of this, everybody's getting settled in and it's kind
5534440	5535960	of a Keith-topia, really.
5540920	5543240	Well, literally, if you know what that means-
5543240	5545160	Shut up, Thomas!
5551240	5551960	Appropriate.
5551960	5562840	Fucking, anyway, yeah, one day Keith is finishing his Sunday morning service and everybody goes
5562840	5568600	outside the church and there's a big dark something in the sky and everybody's like-
5568600	5572040	It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a Keith.
5572040	5579240	As it gets closer, you can tell it's like thousands of Keiths carrying a giant iron
5579240	5582920	dome and Keith is like waving them in, like they can-
5582920	5583960	Oh my God.
5583960	5591000	Yeah, and he gets- make sure it gets centered and they put it over the town of Keith Tension
5591720	5593960	and so now everybody can enjoy the darkness.
5595720	5597400	Oh my God.
5597400	5602520	Luke, that's literally what Mr. Burns did to Springfield in the Simpsons.
5603960	5605160	And we're from Springfield.
5605160	5607080	Yeah, but it's an iron dome.
5607800	5610600	The Simpsons- I'm just saying, the Simpsons predicted-
5616600	5617560	Oh shit.
5617560	5623080	Over the centuries, this town develops no eyeballs, but they can, you know-
5623080	5624680	No more of that, no more of that.
5624680	5627080	The cave people who keep tension.
5628840	5632520	I don't want to think of the mole people who love contention.
5633400	5634920	You don't go to the dome.
5637480	5639560	You'll not date a dome girl.
5641240	5642520	She has no eyes.
5644920	5646520	But father, I love her.
5646520	5648360	I'll hear no more of this.
5648360	5651160	She sees more than any other girl I know.
5651160	5654360	She sees more than you, you blind old fool.
5667080	5671160	Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline.
5671160	5678920	Leaving my mind at your altar, crossing the double line, doing it every time.
5678920	5684360	Tell me what kind of world are you living in?
5687720	5693400	What kind of world are you living in?
5693400	5696840	And the channel changes, and we see the tops of trees,
5696840	5702760	thick enough to obscure any view of what is below and covered in a layer of kudzu.
5702760	5705080	They seem to go on endlessly.
5705640	5709400	Up and down, over hills and valleys, mountains and gorges,
5709400	5713240	there is nothing but dense, verdant forest.
5713240	5719400	A circular, calm lake finds itself somewhere in the midst of this lush wilderness,
5719400	5726040	and in the middle of that lake, a small island with less than a quarter mile from shore to shore.
5726840	5733400	Stunningly gorgeous flowers in every shade and shape fill varied gardens and planters
5733400	5737960	that somehow both overrun the terrain and complement it perfectly.
5738680	5745560	There's a small welcome sign that reads, welcome to calm, comfy campground.
5746120	5752840	At the edge of the water, Maggie Cook sits on top of a bulky metal box.
5753560	5756840	Based on the path left in the wake of this thing,
5756840	5761640	it took some real elbow grease to drag this hefty container all the way out here.
5762200	5766520	But Maggie doesn't look tired from hoofing this thing out to the lake.
5767240	5772120	She looks mentally exhausted, emotionally brutalized.
5772680	5773720	She looks done.
5774600	5784280	Her dad is dead, Fergie is dead, Leon is dead, Anne is dead, and Clark isn't coming.
5785240	5788760	She failed everyone, she failed herself.
5789800	5796600	Maggie Cook stands up and walks toward the large, equally cute and cozy,
5796600	5799400	hexagonal building in the middle of this island.
5800360	5807800	Inside, she finds a thick manila envelope, and her own handwriting is scrawled,
5808680	5811880	New Maggie in black marker.
5813240	5819880	She picks up this envelope, holds her new life against her chest, and opens a door
5819880	5827160	into a room completely filled with stunningly gorgeous flowers in every shade and shape.
5827240	5832360	Maggie Cook takes a deep breath, and shuts the door behind her.
5836760	5837260	Welp.
5840600	5846040	Looks like it's about time for me to leave this newfangled contention.
5846040	5849960	One Keith was too much for me, much too much.
5849960	5855800	But more than that, I can smell that I might be needed elsewhere in some dimension.
5857720	5863480	I've sopped up all the grease a growin' boy like me can round these parts.
5863480	5866920	It's time to move on to greasier pastures.
5867480	5873240	Me and my dog, Wolf the dog, will always be there when you need us.
5873240	5878600	Just look for us to be, uh, grabbin' a bite at your local diner's dumpster.
5879160	5885400	Remember, y'all, this ain't goodbye, it's smell ya later, my babies.
5886120	5892200	My children, my most trusted confidants, my mortal enemies.
5892920	5898840	But before I go, I do have a brand new song here hot off the presses.
5898840	5901800	Too hot to handle, ouchie ouchie.
5902360	5910680	It's time to premiere this fresh track, this tasty, toasty sonata of a new release.
5910680	5913480	You never heard this song before.
5913480	5927400	It's kudzu with no back bone.
5930920	5941400	Hot dog.
5943480	5954920	How am I the only one tryin' to pull over?
5954920	5963400	How can ya have enough drownin' out of the noise?
5963400	5977960	With no back bone, no back bone, no back bone.
5977960	5985160	Fight, fight, street me down, takes me back to where you're from.
5985720	5996200	Don't stop, a dime of devotion to only one.
5996200	6015240	With no back bone, no back bone, no back bone, no back bone.
6026200	6053240	Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up, don't give up.
6053240	6080280	Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up, don't give up.
6083240	6090280	Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up, don't give up.
