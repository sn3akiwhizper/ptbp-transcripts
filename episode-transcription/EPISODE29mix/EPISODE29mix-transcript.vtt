00:00.000 --> 00:04.380
Peace and blessings to all of our listeners here on KITI City Radio, where the only thing

00:04.380 --> 00:08.100
softer than my chin is the K in our name.

00:08.100 --> 00:13.300
I'm your host, Steve N. Smith, filling in for Gary Fazier for the foreseeable future.

00:13.300 --> 00:19.340
Let us slide right into what is, personally, to me, my favorite segment, in my opinion,

00:19.340 --> 00:20.500
within the show.

00:20.500 --> 00:25.180
It's time for, Hey There Steve, where listeners here in the city can send in thoughts and

00:25.180 --> 00:30.540
opinions to be read by me, your host, now and forever, Steve N. Smith.

00:30.540 --> 00:32.520
Steve N. Smith, your host.

00:32.520 --> 00:36.380
This listener has been all over the internet advocating for pretending to be people, a

00:36.380 --> 00:38.700
show that is near and dear to my heart.

00:38.700 --> 00:42.140

ship of itunes or tell a friend about the show or self pretend to cow the snow.

02:28.120 --> 02:30.100
More bells attend than bow and go.

02:30.100 --> 02:35.520
I am pleased as punch and I have a hunch you will stop, drop, and roll for House Fire by

02:35.520 --> 02:37.740
Someone Still Loves You, Boris Yeltsin.

02:48.780 --> 03:18.660
Hi, my little friend is full of

03:18.660 --> 03:21.840
peanuts and jelly.

03:21.840 --> 03:35.140
They always are making good snack taste period.

03:35.140 --> 03:36.140
I think we nailed it.

03:36.140 --> 03:37.140
Question mark?

03:37.140 --> 03:40.140
All right, welcome to pretending to be people.

03:40.140 --> 03:43.780
I feel bad now.

03:43.780 --> 03:46.900
Yeah, well, that's Justin.

03:46.900 --> 03:47.900
Hi.

03:47.900 --> 03:51.180
Yeah, Justin's here for this episode.

03:51.180 --> 03:53.180
We've got Thomas here as well.

03:53.180 --> 03:54.180
Hi.

03:54.180 --> 04:00.820
And things are a bit off the rails here, part of this show, so we're going to see what happens.

04:00.820 --> 04:04.800
Okay, so should we talk about the fact that this is the first time we've recorded an actual

04:04.800 --> 04:07.620
playing session in nearly six months?

04:07.620 --> 04:09.180
I guess we should.

04:09.180 --> 04:14.020
It's been nearly six months since we've recorded an actual session of us playing.

04:14.020 --> 04:19.460
Yeah, the last thing that happened to us was the events of episode 28, I think, or

04:19.460 --> 04:20.460
27?

04:20.460 --> 04:22.260
27, 28 was the Q&A.

04:22.260 --> 04:23.780
Gotcha, yeah.

04:23.780 --> 04:29.020
So we haven't recorded anything since late last year, so we're getting back into it.

04:29.020 --> 04:30.500
We're getting back in the swing of things.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.660
This is the first time you'll hear an episode that we recorded recently.

04:33.660 --> 04:34.660
Yeah, so hopefully our-

04:34.660 --> 04:37.460
It's all the Red Dead Redemption talk in the last episode.

04:37.460 --> 04:41.220
Yeah, hopefully our references are more up to date from here on out.

04:41.220 --> 04:42.540
But we're excited to be back.

04:42.540 --> 04:45.920
The response to the podcast so far has been overwhelming and flattering.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.340
It's made our knees weak.

04:47.340 --> 04:48.340
Yeah.

04:48.340 --> 04:49.940
Justin, has it made your knees weak?

04:49.940 --> 04:50.940
Maybe.

04:50.940 --> 04:51.940
Maybe.

04:51.940 --> 04:53.500
Well, it's made my knees weak, Zach.

04:53.500 --> 04:56.820
No ifs, ands, or maybes about it.

04:56.820 --> 05:00.380
Maybe and, all right.

05:00.380 --> 05:01.380
No but.

05:01.380 --> 05:02.980
I think we should hop right in.

05:02.980 --> 05:10.500
I think we're at a pretty intense situation right now, so let's dive into it.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.340
John Lee Pettymore IV.

05:12.340 --> 05:17.820
This massive room reeks of blood and piss and other bodily fluids.

05:17.820 --> 05:22.780
The pervasive music as well as the thunderous jeering and overall debaucherous crowd noises

05:22.780 --> 05:27.200
have died off, leaving only silence in this cavernous chamber.

05:27.200 --> 05:30.740
Looking down, you see the limp, lifeless body of Keith Vigna.

05:30.740 --> 05:36.540
His jaw is broken off and hanging loosely below a shattered cheekbone that has allowed

05:36.540 --> 05:42.900
one of his eyes to dangle gently off the side of his expressionless face, almost reaching

05:42.900 --> 05:45.780
the blood-soaked concrete floor.

05:45.780 --> 05:54.780
Yeah, so Pettymore stifles some vomit when he sees that, and he takes a moment and he

05:54.780 --> 06:01.660
says, Keith, I know we had our differences, but you didn't deserve to have your jaw ripped

06:01.660 --> 06:06.900
off in your eye, took out, no matter what you did to my smokies.

06:06.900 --> 06:12.020
And I close his remaining eye and move on.

06:12.020 --> 06:17.740
Across the room, you see an inert Clark Bishop slumped halfway out of his broken metal cage.

06:17.740 --> 06:23.380
One of the bars seems to have snapped off into Clark's sternum, and it's a real chest-specific

06:23.380 --> 06:28.400
Phineas Gage situation, what with the bar going in one side and clear out the other.

06:28.400 --> 06:33.400
The bar is kind of propping up Clark's corpse, which is staring across the room at you, cold

06:33.400 --> 06:34.400
and unblinking.

06:34.400 --> 06:39.760
Oh Clark, you were the only one of us worth a damn.

06:39.760 --> 06:41.800
I'm sorry, friend.

06:41.800 --> 06:46.320
The crowd that filled this room moments before has rushed out the only exit, the double doors

06:46.320 --> 06:52.500
on the same wall as the bar, but you see the last two bloodthirsty patrons trying to stealthily

06:52.500 --> 06:56.480
exit the room by creeping together along the wall.

06:56.480 --> 07:00.000
Justin, what does your fellow look like?

07:00.000 --> 07:07.000
In my mind, I have weird, slightly overweight, but just the belly, maybe has a little vest,

07:07.000 --> 07:09.320
like the penguin suit kind of thing going on.

07:09.320 --> 07:10.320
Absolutely.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.760
And what did you say, like an ascot?

07:12.760 --> 07:14.120
Is that like the necktie thing?

07:14.120 --> 07:15.120
Ascot seems good, yeah.

07:15.120 --> 07:19.840
Yeah, like an ascot and a really ill-fitting suit that's like, everything's just a little

07:19.840 --> 07:20.840
too tight.

07:20.840 --> 07:21.840
It looks very uncomfortable.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.320
Does it fit poorly or does it fit ill?

07:24.320 --> 07:25.320
Both.

07:26.160 --> 07:29.000
He, yeah, like too tight of pants.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.360
Oh, that's an ill-fitting suit, dude.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.360
Bro.

07:32.360 --> 07:33.360
Sick.

07:33.360 --> 07:35.360
Fucking sick ass penguin suit.

07:35.360 --> 07:39.840
That's too tight.

07:39.840 --> 07:47.140
And next to that guy is a man dressed very, very similarly who looks very similar, but

07:47.140 --> 07:50.520
the colors that he's wearing are inverted of yours.

07:50.520 --> 07:51.520
That's the way to do it.

07:51.520 --> 07:52.520
That's how twins do it.

07:52.520 --> 07:53.520
That's how twins do it.

07:53.600 --> 07:58.960
And we both have blood just pouring down our mouths onto our cheeks.

07:58.960 --> 07:59.960
Delicious.

07:59.960 --> 08:05.000
We're like looking at it as we're like sliding around the wall, like trying to get away,

08:05.000 --> 08:08.320
trying to just sneak past this one standing person.

08:08.320 --> 08:11.920
John Lee Pettymore points at them and he says, you hold it right there, you blood-eating

08:11.920 --> 08:12.920
sons of bitches.

08:12.920 --> 08:16.720
Oh, and you've got Keith's tiny but powerful gun in your hands.

08:16.720 --> 08:19.360
Pointed right, the noise of cricket pointed right at him.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.360
I mean, I'm scared.

08:20.360 --> 08:23.120
I'm horrified, always horrified.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.160
Even without the gun, I would have been...

08:25.160 --> 08:26.160
Oh my.

08:26.160 --> 08:30.960
I want to approach him and conk their heads together cartoonishly.

08:30.960 --> 08:39.560
Upon doing so, the two sit cross-legged staring up at you.

08:39.560 --> 08:42.120
My good sir, what do you want from us?

08:42.120 --> 08:43.800
We're just trying to leave.

08:43.800 --> 08:44.800
Leave what?

08:44.800 --> 08:45.940
What the hell is going on here?

08:45.940 --> 08:49.540
The greatest party that you've ever seen, have you not?

08:49.540 --> 08:51.560
It wasn't so great from the cages.

08:51.560 --> 08:57.480
Now, one good cop and one other man is dead.

08:57.480 --> 08:58.880
And I want some fucking answers.

08:58.880 --> 09:00.040
Why are we here?

09:00.040 --> 09:01.460
Why were you drinking our blood?

09:01.460 --> 09:02.460
What is this?

09:02.460 --> 09:06.520
Oh, how could you not be partaking in this delicious juice?

09:06.520 --> 09:08.560
Yes, do you want some?

09:08.560 --> 09:09.560
Come right down.

09:09.560 --> 09:11.120
There's plenty on the floor for all.

09:11.120 --> 09:16.080
I conk their heads together again.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.700
I don't want none of your damn people juice.

09:18.700 --> 09:20.080
I want answers.

09:20.080 --> 09:21.560
You best start talking immediately.

09:21.560 --> 09:27.680
Well, I mean obviously you're in Marvin Glass's den of sin.

09:27.680 --> 09:31.680
Yeah, why do you drink the blood?

09:31.680 --> 09:32.680
Why wouldn't you?

09:32.680 --> 09:36.740
It's delightful life-giving powers.

09:36.740 --> 09:41.040
It tastes good and it makes us feel better on the inside.

09:41.040 --> 09:44.240
I don't know why you're kink-shaming me here.

09:44.240 --> 09:48.080
I'm just wanting to drink some boy juice.

09:48.080 --> 09:56.720
Now listen, John Lee Pettymore is a sexually awake creature and he understands that the

09:56.720 --> 10:00.720
spectrum of human pleasure is broad.

10:00.720 --> 10:06.880
But the second it becomes a problem is when you, without consent, start drinking, minding

10:06.880 --> 10:07.880
my partner's blood.

10:07.880 --> 10:11.000
Well, you guys seem to be useless people.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.840
You definitely whipped your dick out and tried to piss on me.

10:14.840 --> 10:15.840
Yes.

10:15.840 --> 10:16.840
It seemed like you were a willing participant.

10:17.600 --> 10:18.600
Now who's kink-shaming?

10:18.600 --> 10:20.520
If you would like to do that again, please.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.760
Yes, we would quite enjoy it.

10:22.760 --> 10:26.240
I would actually like to pee all over E2 right now, but my dick is broken.

10:26.240 --> 10:28.240
I don't think I could pee.

10:28.240 --> 10:29.240
Yeah.

10:29.240 --> 10:34.320
Okay, conk.

10:34.320 --> 10:38.320
How are you so blissfully unaware of everything that's happening here in the city?

10:38.320 --> 10:43.520
Well, I come from a town where some pretty fucked up shit has been going on.

10:43.520 --> 10:45.240
Oh, you're not from here.

10:45.640 --> 10:46.960
Oh, he's not from here.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.160
No, I'm not from here.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.400
Rich, did you hear that?

10:49.400 --> 10:50.960
He's not from here.

10:50.960 --> 10:51.960
Rich.

10:51.960 --> 10:53.960
It sounds like y'all want me to ask you what your names are.

10:53.960 --> 10:58.200
Well, it's awfully rude of you to clonk our heads so many times without asking us what

10:58.200 --> 10:59.200
our names are.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.200
All right, what are your names?

11:00.200 --> 11:01.960
Well, I am Rich.

11:01.960 --> 11:05.160
And I'm Richard Nichols.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.240
Dick Nichols.

11:06.240 --> 11:09.040
Dick Nichols and Rich Nichols at your service.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.560
I conk their heads together.

11:10.560 --> 11:13.360
All right, now that we've been properly introduced.

11:13.360 --> 11:14.820
What's your name?

11:14.820 --> 11:16.860
My name is none of your goddamn business.

11:16.860 --> 11:21.700
Where do you hail from, stranger that pisses on other strangers?

11:21.700 --> 11:22.700
Contention.

11:22.700 --> 11:23.700
That's a-

11:23.700 --> 11:29.140
Why do you- what's that evil laugh for?

11:29.140 --> 11:32.460
Well, we don't hear stories of contention.

11:32.460 --> 11:34.300
What have you heard?

11:34.300 --> 11:41.140
No, just that the police force there might be the most inept in all of the land.

11:41.140 --> 11:42.540
That part might be true.

11:42.540 --> 11:45.140
Not really.

11:45.140 --> 11:48.540
Why does Marvin Glass hate you so much?

11:48.540 --> 11:54.020
That part, well, because he took a bunch of his money and drugs.

11:54.020 --> 11:56.500
Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.220
No, that's a rude thing to do.

11:58.220 --> 11:59.220
We didn't know.

11:59.220 --> 12:00.220
Marvin-

12:00.220 --> 12:03.060
Well, okay, so I've- I mean, like, I found the drugs, right?

12:03.060 --> 12:05.320
I just found them sitting there, so I sold them.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.460
That's Finders Keepers.

12:06.460 --> 12:08.340
I don't know why he can be so mad about that.

12:08.340 --> 12:09.340
I don't know.

12:09.340 --> 12:10.340
Are they his drugs?

12:10.340 --> 12:12.420
No, because somebody had stolen them from him.

12:12.420 --> 12:13.420
I don't follow.

12:13.420 --> 12:16.660
Well, so, like, there were two steps removed from Marvin.

12:16.660 --> 12:18.140
Also, it's drugs, man.

12:18.140 --> 12:19.140
Like-

12:19.140 --> 12:21.060
Rich, does that seem enough steps removed for you?

12:21.060 --> 12:28.340
I'm very curious about this Finders Keepers rule you bring up.

12:28.340 --> 12:33.580
I tend to be a Keepers Keepers sort of man myself.

12:33.580 --> 12:35.760
I think Rich is agreeing with you.

12:35.760 --> 12:37.540
If you keep it, it's yours.

12:37.540 --> 12:38.540
I didn't.

12:38.540 --> 12:39.540
I sold it.

12:39.540 --> 12:40.540
That's why Marvin's so mad.

12:40.540 --> 12:43.700
Keith, my dead friend, see the eyeball dude over there?

12:43.700 --> 12:45.260
Oh, it's delectable.

12:45.260 --> 12:46.260
Oh my.

12:46.260 --> 12:47.260
Erotic.

12:47.260 --> 12:48.260
Yes, it was.

12:48.260 --> 12:49.260
Okay, I conk him.

12:49.260 --> 12:52.260
Can we go now, please?

12:52.260 --> 12:53.260
No.

12:53.260 --> 12:58.580
You've got- you've got many conkings ahead of you yet, weird little fuckers.

12:58.580 --> 13:06.860
Okay, I see- I can see you like that, so- listen, what the- what do you two do in the

13:06.860 --> 13:07.860
city?

13:07.860 --> 13:08.860
Oh, we're security advisors.

13:08.860 --> 13:09.860
In fact-

13:09.860 --> 13:11.380
We're the best of the best, I would say, brother.

13:11.380 --> 13:12.940
We are the best of the best.

13:12.940 --> 13:13.940
The best of the best.

13:13.940 --> 13:20.420
So much that the greatest man in the city, Marvin Glass, hired us to create the security

13:20.420 --> 13:22.820
for this entire denizen.

13:22.820 --> 13:29.820
Since all the denizens of this palace of horror and sin have fled and terror, many are dead,

13:29.820 --> 13:34.540
and the prisoners, me, have escaped, it doesn't seem like you are the best of the best.

13:34.540 --> 13:37.100
Also, you're being held at gunpoint right now.

13:37.100 --> 13:38.500
Yeah, that's a fair point.

13:38.540 --> 13:39.540
That's a good point.

13:39.540 --> 13:40.540
He makes a good point.

13:40.540 --> 13:41.740
How secure is this place?

13:41.740 --> 13:43.420
I guess not very secure.

13:43.420 --> 13:44.900
Can you protect us?

13:44.900 --> 13:45.900
Maybe.

13:45.900 --> 13:46.900
Please?

13:46.900 --> 13:47.900
Listen.

13:47.900 --> 13:51.380
Oh, pretty please, stranger.

13:51.380 --> 13:57.020
We know how to use the security system in this place, and we could get you out of here.

13:57.020 --> 14:03.060
And we may love watching death, but we are, how do you say, not into dying.

14:03.060 --> 14:06.340
Alright, well, first of all, it's gonna cost you.

14:06.340 --> 14:07.340
How much?

14:07.340 --> 14:08.340
Five million dollars.

14:08.340 --> 14:09.340
What?

14:09.340 --> 14:13.180
That's such a large number.

14:13.180 --> 14:15.260
Rich, do we have that much money?

14:15.260 --> 14:18.020
I don't think so, brother.

14:18.020 --> 14:19.700
But I do wish so.

14:19.700 --> 14:21.220
Tell you what, if we-

14:21.220 --> 14:23.940
Wait, wait, hold on.

14:23.940 --> 14:31.460
You guys got the contract to install security throughout this entire supervillain's lair.

14:31.460 --> 14:36.260
You're dressed like millionaires with a bunch of other rich people literally lapping up

14:36.260 --> 14:39.180
the blood of commoners.

14:39.180 --> 14:41.020
And you're telling me you don't have money?

14:41.020 --> 14:43.100
No, we have money.

14:43.100 --> 14:45.820
It's tied up, it's not liquid.

14:45.820 --> 14:48.660
You wouldn't understand.

14:48.660 --> 14:51.060
I happen to be a man of means myself.

14:51.060 --> 14:53.420
I might understand more than you think.

14:53.420 --> 14:54.420
Interesting.

14:54.420 --> 15:02.780
So you propose that you kill us, and then you die here, or we help you escape, and you

15:02.780 --> 15:05.420
pay us lots of money?

15:05.420 --> 15:06.420
No.

15:06.420 --> 15:07.420
Hmmmm.

15:07.420 --> 15:11.100
No, that's not, that's not, you're not listening.

15:11.100 --> 15:12.100
I propose-

15:12.100 --> 15:13.900
I think we know exactly what's going on here.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.340
I propose that you pay me-

15:15.340 --> 15:16.340
For what?

15:16.340 --> 15:17.340
To not kill you.

15:17.340 --> 15:18.340
Oh.

15:18.340 --> 15:19.340
Oh.

15:19.340 --> 15:20.340
No, go ahead.

15:20.340 --> 15:21.340
I don't care.

15:21.340 --> 15:22.340
Do you want to get out of here alive?

15:22.340 --> 15:23.860
We have the ability to make that happen.

15:23.860 --> 15:28.900
It's not a strong negotiating tactic to give up what you want, so I think I don't care

15:28.900 --> 15:29.900
either.

15:29.900 --> 15:30.900
Okay.

15:30.900 --> 15:34.300
I'm gonna shoot you in the knee now.

15:34.300 --> 15:35.300
And then I shoot you in the knee.

15:35.300 --> 15:36.300
Oh no, brother!

15:36.300 --> 15:40.300
Oh my, can you see it?

15:40.300 --> 15:41.300
Conk.

15:41.300 --> 15:42.700
He's like licking at his knee.

15:42.700 --> 15:45.660
I conk you so you can't lick your own blood.

15:45.660 --> 15:49.060
Oh, let me get in there, brother.

15:49.060 --> 15:53.020
Please, get that tongue inside me.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.020
Let's move on.

15:54.020 --> 15:55.020
Yeah, I don't know-

15:55.020 --> 16:04.820
My knee hurts, god damn.

16:04.820 --> 16:09.500
But we still can help you out of here if you're willing to part with some of your apparent

16:09.500 --> 16:10.500
money.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.820
No, I mean, I can probably get out.

16:12.820 --> 16:16.100
I'd help you guys not die though, if you pay me.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.100
That's pretty much my offer.

16:17.100 --> 16:18.100
Okay, sounds good.

16:18.100 --> 16:19.500
We'll give it to you later.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.740
Yes, we pinkies will.

16:22.740 --> 16:24.700
Do you hold out your pinkies, eh?

16:24.700 --> 16:25.700
No.

16:25.700 --> 16:26.700
Butt.

16:26.700 --> 16:29.300
I hold out my butt.

16:29.300 --> 16:31.980
We put our pinkies in your butt.

16:31.980 --> 16:32.980
All right.

16:32.980 --> 16:33.980
It's a deal.

16:33.980 --> 16:34.980
Gentlemen's cake.

16:34.980 --> 16:38.140
Now we've sworn the old-fashioned way.

16:38.140 --> 16:42.060
All right, five million dollars.

16:42.060 --> 16:48.340
That's what that stinky finger promises.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.580
Good lord, man.

16:50.580 --> 16:56.500
Hearing a voice near Clark Bishop's shish-kabobed corpse, you look over and see a hunched man

16:56.500 --> 17:00.840
wearing an old tattered robe with a hood that covers his face.

17:00.840 --> 17:09.620
The voice is crackly and muttering something ancient and jaunty.

17:09.620 --> 17:15.720
A bright light begins to form under the hood that is obfuscating this being's face.

17:15.720 --> 17:21.200
As it reaches its hands into the light, the hood is drawn back, and this old man rips

17:21.200 --> 17:25.840
an unnaturally bright light out of his familiar face.

17:25.840 --> 17:32.660
A much older Clark Bishop takes his beaming hands and reaches deep into the chest of the

17:32.660 --> 17:39.080
Clark Bishop you've known before yanking out the bar and throwing his younger self's body

17:39.080 --> 17:42.520
over his shoulder.

17:42.520 --> 17:56.840
Before you can act, in a flash the length of a blink, both Clark Bishops are gone.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.160
Roll sanity.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.160
93.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.160
Whoo!

18:00.160 --> 18:03.960
Go ahead and lose one.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.440
What's that put you at?

18:05.440 --> 18:06.440
23.

18:06.440 --> 18:07.440
Whoo!

18:07.440 --> 18:08.440
You are going down.

18:08.440 --> 18:10.240
Okay, and my breaking point is 20.

18:10.240 --> 18:14.800
Oh my god, brother, that was so interesting.

18:14.800 --> 18:20.920
That was one of the stranger things I've ever seen.

18:20.920 --> 18:27.860
Was that your, what, did your, your man friend just disappear with another man?

18:27.860 --> 18:35.200
He's not my man friend, he's my friend man, and again, I think that an old man and a dead

18:35.200 --> 18:37.920
man can just both sneak out of here.

18:37.920 --> 18:38.920
That they did.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.840
Dog shit at your jobs, guys.

18:40.840 --> 18:41.840
The security here is non-existent.

18:41.840 --> 18:46.960
We've agreed that maybe we could have done a little bit more.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.160
Maybe we would have made more money.

18:49.160 --> 18:57.360
That's true, delicious money.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.600
Did you mention that you were from Contention?

18:59.600 --> 19:01.520
I did.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.000
What you been hearing about Contention?

19:03.000 --> 19:06.480
Well we do know one man from Contention, I heard tell.

19:06.480 --> 19:13.200
He was a, god, he was such a lush, he came in, he was trying to get into the VIP section

19:13.200 --> 19:14.200
here one night.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.960
They just don't let anyone in there.

19:16.960 --> 19:20.240
No, and he was this dumb, small looking man.

19:20.240 --> 19:26.960
I mean, he was like balding and round and I believe, Kevin, what was his name?

19:26.960 --> 19:27.960
I can't remember.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.760
Anyway, he said that he worked for the government.

19:30.760 --> 19:34.800
I was here, I was pretty lit, weren't we, Rich?

19:34.800 --> 19:36.880
That is always my dear brother.

19:36.880 --> 19:41.960
And we were, I mean, just on the verge of it, right?

19:41.960 --> 19:47.600
And he starts talking about how he's been in a coma, whoop-de-doo for him.

19:47.600 --> 19:51.440
And we were like, why does that mean that you should be in the VIP section?

19:51.440 --> 19:55.600
And he said that he was having visions while he was in this coma.

19:55.600 --> 20:00.600
And we said, yes, we have visions all the time.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.520
What's your favorite vision that you've had?

20:02.560 --> 20:07.000
Oh, I couldn't say, brother, not in front of a stranger.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
No, tell me.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Completely agreed.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.680
They're too personal.

20:10.680 --> 20:17.680
And this man, I mean, he had the audacity to post about his visions online, online.

20:17.680 --> 20:21.360
It's like sharing your mind diary with the public.

20:21.360 --> 20:22.360
It's so absurd.

20:22.360 --> 20:26.840
And the government got a hold of it and they sent some man named, oh, what was the name

20:26.840 --> 20:28.000
he kept saying?

20:28.000 --> 20:30.360
Agent Victor, I believe?

20:30.360 --> 20:31.880
Victor, I think it was.

20:31.880 --> 20:33.440
It was so odd.

20:33.440 --> 20:37.920
He said that this Agent Victor paid him a visit and he was the one who told him about

20:37.920 --> 20:43.240
the mind probing device that apparently ISIS is using now to give people vision.

20:43.240 --> 20:46.280
So he said, claimed he was now like in the know.

20:46.280 --> 20:47.280
Hold on.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.280
ISIS?

20:48.280 --> 20:49.280
Yeah, ISIS.

20:49.280 --> 20:50.280
Like ISIL?

20:50.280 --> 20:51.280
Like Daesh?

20:51.280 --> 20:52.280
Sure.

20:52.280 --> 20:53.280
Whatever.

20:53.280 --> 20:55.280
I'm not much for current events.

20:55.280 --> 20:57.480
ISIS has mind control technology.

20:57.480 --> 20:59.800
Isn't that the worst news you've heard today?

20:59.800 --> 21:00.920
I just don't believe it.

21:00.960 --> 21:01.960
I don't know.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.360
I understand why you didn't let John Peters in your place.

21:04.360 --> 21:06.880
He seems like a raging lunatic.

21:06.880 --> 21:07.880
Yeah.

21:07.880 --> 21:09.360
Everyone from contention is.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.360
Okay.

21:10.360 --> 21:12.560
Well, I shoot him in the other knee.

21:12.560 --> 21:16.380
Can we go now, please?

21:16.380 --> 21:19.160
My brother's leg is so hurt.

21:19.160 --> 21:21.320
I am in such deep pain.

21:21.320 --> 21:24.920
I'd love to take care of it for him outside of here.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.960
I love the pain.

21:26.960 --> 21:30.400
That's a conkin.

21:30.400 --> 21:31.400
That's a conkin.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.400
That's a conkin.

21:32.400 --> 21:33.400
Oh, that?

21:33.400 --> 21:34.400
That's a conkin.

21:34.400 --> 21:37.480
That's his dang conkin, boy.

21:37.480 --> 21:45.920
Richard Nichols stands up and with the help of his brother, he says, sir, we, we must,

21:45.920 --> 21:47.320
we must go now.

21:47.320 --> 21:51.400
Otherwise I, the security will be here any moment and we need to go through these double

21:51.400 --> 21:52.400
doors.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.400
It's the only way out.

21:53.400 --> 21:54.680
Are you going to pay me not to kill you?

21:54.680 --> 21:58.920
We are absolutely going to pay you.

21:58.920 --> 22:04.920
All right, well, I feel like you're not, but I don't want to get killed either.

22:04.920 --> 22:07.960
So you can get me past the security here.

22:07.960 --> 22:12.440
Uh, let's, let's get moving, but I want to find some place, some things out about this

22:12.440 --> 22:13.440
place first.

22:13.440 --> 22:20.400
So you guys walk up through the double doors and into a long wide hallway with tall ceilings.

22:20.400 --> 22:26.280
The floor, ceiling and walls are made out of black marble, making depth perception difficult.

22:26.280 --> 22:31.080
Your eyes take a second to adjust and you see at the end of the hallway is an elevator

22:31.080 --> 22:32.080
door.

22:32.080 --> 22:36.960
There are also two doors about 10 yards away from you, one on each side of the hallway

22:36.960 --> 22:42.640
above the elevator is a dial that is slowly moving from the left to the right side.

22:42.640 --> 22:43.640
Oh no.

22:43.640 --> 22:44.640
Oh my.

22:44.640 --> 22:45.640
Oh God.

22:45.640 --> 22:46.640
The elevator.

22:46.640 --> 22:47.640
It's coming down here.

22:47.640 --> 22:48.640
It's coming down here.

22:48.640 --> 22:49.740
Someone's on their way.

22:49.740 --> 22:51.460
This can't be good, brother.

22:51.460 --> 22:53.420
Oh no, no, no, no.

22:53.420 --> 22:54.420
Okay.

22:54.420 --> 22:55.420
Okay.

22:55.420 --> 22:56.420
Let's um, you're, you're Richard, right?

22:56.420 --> 22:57.420
I'm Richard.

22:57.420 --> 22:58.420
And you're Dick.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.420
Yes.

22:59.420 --> 23:00.420
But rich.

23:00.420 --> 23:01.420
Yes.

23:01.420 --> 23:04.980
No, I'm Dick and Richard and I'm also rich and Dick.

23:04.980 --> 23:05.980
Dickard.

23:05.980 --> 23:06.980
Okay.

23:06.980 --> 23:07.980
Dick.

23:07.980 --> 23:10.700
Why don't, why don't you look away real quick?

23:10.700 --> 23:11.700
Okay.

23:11.700 --> 23:12.700
I execute.

23:12.700 --> 23:18.900
Dick, I'm sorry, but your brother's a creep and a liability.

23:18.900 --> 23:22.700
And uh, unfortunately I shot him in the knee to prove a point, but that just slowed him

23:22.700 --> 23:23.700
down.

23:23.700 --> 23:26.780
Uh, so that's why I had to shoot him just now.

23:26.780 --> 23:30.880
If you'd like to take a moment and lap up his blood before you run through one of these

23:30.880 --> 23:41.940
doors with me, I'd understand brother, I need it now.

23:41.940 --> 23:43.820
I start lapping that bad boy up.

23:43.820 --> 23:44.820
Okay.

23:44.820 --> 23:45.820
Okay.

23:45.820 --> 23:46.820
All right.

23:46.820 --> 23:47.820
That's while sobbing uncontrollably.

23:47.820 --> 23:48.820
That's enough.

23:49.740 --> 23:50.740
Go.

23:50.740 --> 23:51.740
We got to go.

23:51.740 --> 23:53.740
A little bit more of my brother's blood, please.

23:53.740 --> 23:58.260
I squirt a little bit from his knee into, I just, I just squeeze.

23:58.260 --> 23:59.260
Oh boy.

23:59.260 --> 24:00.260
All right.

24:00.260 --> 24:01.260
Okay.

24:01.260 --> 24:02.260
Dick.

24:02.260 --> 24:03.260
Are you ready?

24:03.260 --> 24:04.260
Like a blood fountain?

24:04.260 --> 24:05.260
Like you squeeze it up into?

24:05.260 --> 24:06.260
Yeah.

24:06.260 --> 24:07.260
Like a blood Capri Sun.

24:07.260 --> 24:10.420
Or like a hose when you like spurred it so it'll go into your mouth.

24:10.420 --> 24:11.420
Exactly.

24:11.420 --> 24:13.740
Is that, Hey, is that enough of your brother's blood?

24:13.740 --> 24:18.380
I raise my blood soaked face up and I go, I think that has to do for now.

24:18.940 --> 24:19.940
All right.

24:19.940 --> 24:23.940
So I'm going to take the price down to 2.5 fair is fair and uh, let's get the fuck out

24:23.940 --> 24:24.940
of here.

24:24.940 --> 24:27.820
Oh, I guess that will have to do.

24:27.820 --> 24:32.780
I'm still holding like the blood up to like the little spurt up to my mouth a little bit.

24:32.780 --> 24:38.140
I conk him against his brother's corpse head and I'm like, we do not have time.

24:38.140 --> 24:39.140
It hurts.

24:39.140 --> 24:40.620
Let's go, Dick.

24:40.620 --> 24:41.620
You guys don't have time.

24:41.620 --> 24:42.980
Do you go left or right?

24:42.980 --> 24:43.980
Left.

24:43.980 --> 24:44.980
All right.

24:44.980 --> 24:45.980
Wait, no, I mean he, where do we go?

24:45.980 --> 24:46.980
Sorry.

24:46.980 --> 24:51.500
I'm not super familiar with the map, but I'd say left is probably good.

24:51.500 --> 24:52.500
Oh, left then.

24:52.500 --> 24:53.500
God damn it.

24:53.500 --> 24:55.620
Did I kill the wrong brother?

24:55.620 --> 24:58.180
You very well may have my friend.

24:58.180 --> 24:59.180
All right.

24:59.180 --> 25:01.060
Get us through the door.

25:01.060 --> 25:02.060
Let's go.

25:02.060 --> 25:08.340
There's a touch screen next to the door and Rich begins fumbling with it and let's see

25:08.340 --> 25:09.340
here.

25:09.340 --> 25:10.340
I don't remember properly.

25:10.340 --> 25:15.220
It was something like, and the door opens inside this door.

25:15.220 --> 25:22.340
You walk into a small empty foyer that leads to four more doors and the door closes behind

25:22.340 --> 25:23.660
you.

25:23.660 --> 25:27.780
You've got one door on your left, two ahead of you, and one on your right.

25:27.780 --> 25:34.620
They are labeled Kevin, Francis, Charles, Rosemary.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.740
Oh my God.

25:36.740 --> 25:40.660
What a potentially informative set of doors.

25:40.660 --> 25:43.060
I would like to go into Rosemary's door.

25:43.060 --> 25:44.460
I can help with that.

25:44.460 --> 25:50.620
If I remember correctly, it was something like this, but my dear brother always used

25:50.620 --> 25:54.380
to do this door, but I'm doing this in his honor.

25:54.380 --> 25:56.720
And the door opens.

25:56.720 --> 26:03.580
This room contains three things, a bed, a popcorn machine, and a television screen the

26:03.580 --> 26:08.580
size of an entire wall that is currently playing an episode of Happy Days.

26:08.580 --> 26:09.580
That figures.

26:09.580 --> 26:12.100
The popcorn machine is an oddly whimsical touch for Rosemary.

26:12.100 --> 26:14.580
I'll take a moment to reflect on that.

26:14.580 --> 26:17.980
Is there any way to tell where Rosemary is in the building right now?

26:17.980 --> 26:19.340
I don't think so.

26:19.340 --> 26:25.500
We usually don't track people so much as capture them and, you know.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.140
Make them fight for bloodsport.

26:27.140 --> 26:28.140
Yes.

26:28.140 --> 26:29.940
All right.

26:29.940 --> 26:31.300
These guys seem to be really into blood.

26:31.300 --> 26:32.900
Could I drink some blood for willpower?

26:32.900 --> 26:36.540
I've never- They're really talking up it's healing benefits.

26:36.540 --> 26:40.580
They really are talking up it's healing powers.

26:40.580 --> 26:42.380
I did leave the- Do you drink some blood?

26:42.380 --> 26:45.860
Well, we left the source in the hallway with a guard.

26:45.860 --> 26:46.860
Oh, yeah.

26:46.860 --> 26:52.340
I lick Rich's face.

26:52.340 --> 26:55.100
I know you were going to like it, Rich.

26:55.100 --> 26:56.100
I know.

26:56.100 --> 26:57.100
Just let me- You were correct, Seth.

26:57.100 --> 27:00.180
Stop wiggling so much and let me get some of this blood.

27:00.180 --> 27:06.860
And as he's wiggling, he moves the pillow on the bed and under it, there's a picture.

27:06.860 --> 27:07.860
Yeah.

27:07.860 --> 27:08.860
I think I know who it is.

27:08.860 --> 27:09.860
Oh, really?

27:09.860 --> 27:10.860
Yeah.

27:10.860 --> 27:11.860
Is it Marvin Glass's boy?

27:11.860 --> 27:12.860
It is.

27:12.860 --> 27:13.860
Mm-hmm.

27:13.860 --> 27:14.860
It absolutely is.

27:14.860 --> 27:15.860
Yeah.

27:15.860 --> 27:16.860
I had some suspicions about Rosemary's motivations.

27:16.860 --> 27:23.500
Rosemary has a picture of a slender, muscular man in a black t-shirt and black tactical

27:23.500 --> 27:24.500
pants.

27:24.500 --> 27:29.620
He has tribal tattoo sleeves on both arms going down his hands and fingertips.

27:29.620 --> 27:31.500
This guy seems cool.

27:31.500 --> 27:37.340
There's a sharpied heart around this man's face, which is stoic, almost blank.

27:37.340 --> 27:42.900
And she has written Rosemary Glass all over it.

27:42.900 --> 27:44.900
Rosemary.

27:44.900 --> 27:46.060
Yeah.

27:46.060 --> 27:49.460
If we all get out of this, I do hope you find the love you seek someday, Rosemary.

27:49.460 --> 27:52.260
I'm going to give you 10 luck for calling that.

27:52.260 --> 27:53.260
Oh, thank you.

27:53.260 --> 27:54.260
That puts me to 55.

27:54.260 --> 27:55.260
Congratulations.

27:55.260 --> 27:59.540
And we talked about how we haven't recorded since September.

27:59.540 --> 28:04.420
I've been thinking about that for the next ... I'm like, oh shit, I think I know why

28:04.420 --> 28:07.000
she sent us for the gun.

28:07.000 --> 28:13.480
In the background, as soon as you get that luck, you hear Fonzie go, aye.

28:13.480 --> 28:14.480
Thank you.

28:14.480 --> 28:15.480
Thank you, Fonz.

28:15.480 --> 28:16.480
Seemed right.

28:16.480 --> 28:17.760
At the exact right time.

28:17.760 --> 28:18.760
Exactly.

28:18.760 --> 28:23.440
Rich, have you watched Barry on HBO with Henry Winkler?

28:23.440 --> 28:26.680
I can't say I watch TV very often.

28:26.680 --> 28:27.680
It's excellent.

28:27.680 --> 28:28.680
You should check it out.

28:28.680 --> 28:32.920
He does a great job as Gene Cusinow, the head of the acting theater.

28:32.920 --> 28:36.480
John Lee Pettymore IV endorses Barry on HBO.

28:36.480 --> 28:38.000
Go check it out.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Timely references.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Exactly.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.200
The season's on right now, y'all.

28:42.200 --> 28:46.060
Actually, it won't be by the time this goes to air.

28:46.060 --> 28:47.060
Always behind.

28:47.060 --> 28:48.060
Always.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.060
All right.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.280
I want to go into Kevin's room now.

28:50.280 --> 28:51.400
Did y'all hire Kevin?

28:51.400 --> 28:53.000
Do you know much about Kevin?

28:53.000 --> 28:57.720
Rich, I think Kevin would have been around for as long as you've been there.

28:57.720 --> 29:00.560
He's always been Marvin Glass's number two security.

29:00.560 --> 29:01.560
Okay.

29:01.560 --> 29:04.480
Kevin Glass is number two security, not head of security for the building.

29:04.480 --> 29:05.480
I guess both.

29:05.480 --> 29:06.480
Yeah.

29:06.480 --> 29:07.480
He's like his right-hand man basically.

29:07.480 --> 29:08.480
Okay.

29:08.480 --> 29:11.080
Oh, I've known Kevin for quite a while.

29:11.080 --> 29:13.840
He was always Marvin's number two.

29:13.840 --> 29:15.160
Interesting.

29:15.160 --> 29:22.840
You didn't happen to have any involvement in, say, making people like Rosemary unkillable

29:22.840 --> 29:23.840
in any way?

29:23.840 --> 29:29.320
Or, well, I guess it was Keith's brother who might have raised all those mutant children.

29:29.320 --> 29:31.320
Anyway, did you make Rosemary immortal?

29:31.320 --> 29:32.800
Or do you know that she might be?

29:32.800 --> 29:35.080
I can't say we had any part in that.

29:35.080 --> 29:41.840
We mostly stuck to the doors and whatnot.

29:41.840 --> 29:51.120
When you go into Kevin's room, you guys leave and go into Kevin's room, it is the epitome

29:51.120 --> 29:52.360
of minimalism.

29:52.360 --> 29:55.680
There is a full-sized bed neatly made in the corner.

29:55.680 --> 29:58.080
There's a chest of drawers against the wall.

29:58.080 --> 30:00.640
And the only other thing in the room is a desk with a chair.

30:00.640 --> 30:03.200
I'm not in great shape.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.200
No, you're not.

30:04.200 --> 30:06.640
You're just stumbling around.

30:06.640 --> 30:07.640
What's in here?

30:07.640 --> 30:08.640
You've got blood.

30:08.640 --> 30:09.880
It's just smearing.

30:09.880 --> 30:13.880
Also, you're still in your underwear from the fighting that took place.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.860
You got your underwear in the cages.

30:16.860 --> 30:19.120
You're welcome, listeners.

30:19.120 --> 30:24.640
And then you were in the cage with Keith, and then you fell out, and you've been fighting,

30:24.640 --> 30:25.640
and there's blood everywhere.

30:25.640 --> 30:28.720
I've got the goo of the guy that I landed on probably.

30:28.720 --> 30:29.720
Oh, just all over you.

30:29.800 --> 30:30.800
You've got toenails.

30:30.800 --> 30:31.800
Yeah.

30:31.800 --> 30:38.760
So you're slip-sliding around all over this place, and when you check the desk, you grab

30:38.760 --> 30:44.360
onto it, and you do notice that there is a different texture underneath the desk than

30:44.360 --> 30:45.560
there is on top of it.

30:45.560 --> 30:47.400
I'd like to feel around under the desk.

30:47.400 --> 30:53.200
When you feel around, the texture is, it seems like someone's carved into the bottom of the

30:53.200 --> 30:54.200
desk.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.520
Rich, get under there.

30:56.520 --> 30:57.520
Tell me what this desk says.

30:57.520 --> 31:01.080
That's what I love doing is getting under things.

31:01.080 --> 31:06.840
And as you get under it, you see that the phrase, not Kevin, has been carved into the

31:06.840 --> 31:13.840
bottom of the desk over and over and over and on top of itself repeatedly.

31:13.840 --> 31:17.720
Not Kevin.

31:17.720 --> 31:18.720
That's weird.

31:18.720 --> 31:21.080
You sure that's what it says?

31:21.080 --> 31:22.080
Check again.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.080
I'm looking at it.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.080
It's very unsettling.

31:24.640 --> 31:29.040
Rich, go ahead and roll Sanity for me.

31:29.040 --> 31:32.040
I always fail.

31:32.040 --> 31:35.840
Do you want to look at anything else in this room?

31:35.840 --> 31:37.760
Yeah, I want to look under the bed.

31:37.760 --> 31:39.000
I'd like to pop under the bed.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Rich, look under the bed.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
As you wish.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.760
That's why you're here, Rich.

31:43.760 --> 31:45.720
Well, I'm just leaning against the wall.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.200
Bending hurts right now, so.

31:47.200 --> 31:48.200
That makes sense.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.200
Oh, yeah.

31:49.200 --> 31:53.000
Oh, my broken dick.

31:53.000 --> 31:57.080
Rich, under the bed, you find a notepad.

31:57.080 --> 31:59.840
Seems to be some kind of notepad under here.

31:59.840 --> 32:00.840
Pass that here, Richard.

32:00.840 --> 32:02.000
I slides it.

32:02.000 --> 32:08.600
On every page, it says, quote, I had the same dream again last night.

32:08.600 --> 32:11.640
She just says, I'm so sorry.

32:11.640 --> 32:13.380
He's just so beautiful.

32:13.380 --> 32:15.160
You don't have to do this.

32:15.160 --> 32:16.360
We can leave.

32:16.360 --> 32:19.300
We can run.

32:19.300 --> 32:23.740
On every page of the notepad.

32:23.740 --> 32:27.780
I've heard that, but I don't know if John Lee Peddingmore's heard that or if I've heard

32:27.780 --> 32:28.780
that.

32:28.780 --> 32:29.780
John Lee Peddingmore.

32:29.780 --> 32:30.780
Okay, where did he hear that?

32:30.780 --> 32:31.780
It was in your dream.

32:31.780 --> 32:32.780
Oh, right.

32:32.780 --> 32:33.780
And I recognized him.

32:33.780 --> 32:34.780
Okay.

32:34.780 --> 32:40.280
So John Lee Peddingmore recognizes the words on the page from his dream, and a chill runs

32:40.280 --> 32:41.500
down his spine.

32:41.500 --> 32:44.940
Just a sickening recognition, but it shouldn't be there.

32:44.940 --> 32:53.580
As Rich gets up from crawling under the bed, he bonks his head on one of the chested drawers,

32:53.580 --> 32:58.640
and he's like, ooh.

32:58.640 --> 33:04.540
And he sees that there's carving underneath this drawer as well.

33:04.540 --> 33:06.220
Rich, what's it say?

33:06.220 --> 33:12.220
It says, Mary in the woods, over and over and over.

33:12.220 --> 33:14.220
Mary in the woods.

33:14.500 --> 33:16.700
Kevin's a real focused guy, you know?

33:16.700 --> 33:17.700
Yeah, he seems to write.

33:17.700 --> 33:18.700
He gets on one thing.

33:18.700 --> 33:23.980
Yes, I was going to say lots of repeated phrases and such.

33:23.980 --> 33:24.980
It's interesting.

33:24.980 --> 33:25.980
It's a style.

33:25.980 --> 33:26.980
You know, it's a choice.

33:26.980 --> 33:31.420
I wouldn't make it, but you gotta, you know, you gotta explore your own artistic avenues.

33:31.420 --> 33:34.620
Can I see what, like, I want to check all the drawers on this desk now and see.

33:34.620 --> 33:39.940
Every single drawer in the chested drawers says Mary in the woods carved over and over

33:39.940 --> 33:41.380
and over again.

33:41.380 --> 33:43.820
Mary in the woods.

33:43.820 --> 33:46.780
To the point to where, like, the wood is thin.

33:46.780 --> 33:48.620
And Kevin's an intense dude.

33:48.620 --> 33:54.680
Yes, I've known Kevin a while, and I would say intense is one of the few adjectives I

33:54.680 --> 33:59.100
know about him.

33:59.100 --> 34:03.420
You're handling the death of your brother pretty well.

34:03.420 --> 34:05.900
Well, he'll always be with me.

34:05.900 --> 34:18.860
We went right back to being a little freak right away, so I appreciate that.

34:18.860 --> 34:24.020
Alright, let's go through these other rooms here.

34:24.020 --> 34:25.940
As you wish, sir.

34:25.940 --> 34:28.100
Let's go into Charles' room.

34:28.100 --> 34:29.580
As you wish, sir.

34:29.580 --> 34:33.820
This room looks like it was a set used on Mad Men.

34:33.820 --> 34:38.780
Everything is beautiful, but it smells like someone spilled a vat of Everclear in here.

34:38.780 --> 34:44.040
There is a well-stocked bar, and the closet is full of different uniforms and disguises.

34:44.040 --> 34:47.340
There is a computer, and there are a shitload of tabs open.

34:47.340 --> 34:53.500
They are all about the town of contention, different businesses, and maps to Hotel Motel,

34:53.500 --> 34:56.260
John Peters' house, and the Piston Pig Farm.

34:56.260 --> 34:57.260
The pig farm.

34:57.260 --> 34:58.260
The homeless.

34:58.260 --> 35:00.660
Damn it, what does it all mean?

35:00.660 --> 35:03.140
There's an email open as well in one of the tabs.

35:03.140 --> 35:06.540
If only I could read.

35:06.540 --> 35:08.660
I read the email.

35:08.660 --> 35:14.460
So there's actually nothing in his inbox, but there is one email still in the drafts

35:14.460 --> 35:15.460
folder.

35:15.460 --> 35:24.940
The email details that Rosemary and I, Charles, found the gun that turned Alfred mad in the

35:24.940 --> 35:26.620
possession of a young girl.

35:26.620 --> 35:29.740
A chase ensued, and she got away.

35:29.740 --> 35:33.940
He also adds that there are more strange items that are in contention, and he thinks that

35:33.940 --> 35:35.860
they should try to collect them all.

35:35.860 --> 35:36.860
Interesting.

35:36.860 --> 35:41.980
So poor Tilde B had a run-in with Charles before she met us.

35:41.980 --> 35:44.460
No wonder she didn't trust us.

35:44.460 --> 35:46.580
Plus, fuck the police.

35:46.580 --> 35:47.580
Yes.

35:47.580 --> 35:49.540
Yeah, he knows what I'm saying.

35:49.540 --> 35:53.180
I guess that explains why she was so nervous when she saw us.

35:53.180 --> 35:57.140
Okay, on to the last room, Richard.

35:57.140 --> 35:58.140
Richie.

35:58.140 --> 35:59.140
Dick.

36:00.140 --> 36:01.140
Wouldn't you like to know?

36:01.140 --> 36:04.780
Yes, that's why I just asked.

36:04.780 --> 36:09.140
The last room is Francis, and this room is a fucking disaster.

36:09.140 --> 36:13.640
Clothes have been tossed onto every surface, the bed, the floor, the armoire, everywhere.

36:13.640 --> 36:18.740
The walls are made out of whiteboard that is filled with equations.

36:18.740 --> 36:23.040
There's a single drawing of a sphere, one inch in diameter.

36:23.040 --> 36:24.300
This person seems smart.

36:24.300 --> 36:27.780
I bet they're not related to Keith.

36:27.780 --> 36:29.500
Do you know anything about these equations?

36:29.500 --> 36:30.900
I can't say that I do.

36:30.900 --> 36:34.500
I've never been much of a math man myself.

36:34.500 --> 36:37.860
I'd like to do an intelligence roll and see if I can decipher what any of this is about.

36:37.860 --> 36:38.860
Okay.

36:38.860 --> 36:42.500
I mean, I didn't typically apply myself in school, but I did have a head for figures,

36:42.500 --> 36:45.140
and I was an AP Calculus.

36:45.140 --> 36:49.580
This is...

36:49.580 --> 36:50.580
Last name.

36:50.580 --> 36:53.220
Really inspired me.

36:53.220 --> 36:54.220
You know, I was a pretty rough...

36:54.220 --> 36:55.220
You know what?

36:55.220 --> 36:56.220
You don't care about this, but...

36:56.660 --> 36:58.660
I'm always interested to hear a good story.

36:58.660 --> 37:00.780
All right, well, picture this.

37:00.780 --> 37:04.500
We were both butt naked, naked on the bathroom floor.

37:04.500 --> 37:05.500
I did.

37:05.500 --> 37:08.660
Yeah, that's unfortunately why Mrs. Lastname got fired.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.980
All right, I'm rolling...

37:10.980 --> 37:13.180
Oh, an intelligence roll to see if I can figure out...

37:13.180 --> 37:14.180
Add a negative 20.

37:14.180 --> 37:15.180
The negative 20.

37:15.180 --> 37:16.180
32.

37:16.180 --> 37:17.180
I passed.

37:17.180 --> 37:21.580
My intelligence is 75, so I'm rolling on a 55.

37:21.580 --> 37:29.740
These equations are built to perform some sort of mathematics that do not exist in this

37:29.740 --> 37:31.080
world.

37:31.080 --> 37:36.860
She is coming up with solutions that do not make sense with the math that you know to

37:36.860 --> 37:38.340
be absolutely true.

37:38.340 --> 37:40.340
Go ahead and roll sanity for me.

37:40.340 --> 37:41.340
Three.

37:41.340 --> 37:42.340
I passed.

37:42.340 --> 37:43.340
Fuck.

37:43.340 --> 37:47.060
No, honestly, like, I kind of...

37:47.060 --> 37:48.060
I don't know.

37:48.060 --> 37:49.060
So this makes sense to you.

37:49.060 --> 37:52.500
You were looking at math that doesn't make sense, and you were starting to realize with

37:52.500 --> 37:56.620
everything that you've seen in this world that the math that you grew up with is not

37:56.620 --> 38:00.540
the math that actually exists in this reality.

38:00.540 --> 38:01.540
Richard, this...

38:01.540 --> 38:02.540
Hold on.

38:02.540 --> 38:06.380
Okay, I'd like to do a search roll in this room.

38:06.380 --> 38:07.380
Okay.

38:07.380 --> 38:08.380
Five.

38:08.380 --> 38:09.540
Oh, shit.

38:09.540 --> 38:12.240
These dice are all over the place.

38:12.240 --> 38:14.500
That means they're working.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.500
So when you...

38:15.500 --> 38:18.340
What did you do to my dice, you piece of shit?

38:18.340 --> 38:19.980
When you...

38:19.980 --> 38:25.260
Looking through the room, you start moving some of the clothes out of the way, and underneath

38:25.260 --> 38:28.100
a shirt or something, there's a picture.

38:28.100 --> 38:32.420
There's a picture of Frances with a man and a woman who are older than her.

38:32.420 --> 38:37.380
It looks like a family picture, like it's her parents, and her father, the Duke, has

38:37.380 --> 38:40.660
his eyes crossed out with X's from a Sharpie.

38:40.660 --> 38:41.660
Teen angst.

38:41.660 --> 38:42.660
We've all been there.

38:42.660 --> 38:43.660
We have.

38:43.660 --> 38:45.520
Until Mrs. Lastname got ahold of me.

38:45.520 --> 38:48.260
Really turned me around.

38:48.260 --> 38:49.860
More ways than one.

38:49.860 --> 38:50.860
Hot.

38:50.860 --> 38:51.860
Yeah.

38:51.860 --> 38:52.860
Uh-huh.

38:52.860 --> 38:59.620
All right, well, this room of this precocious teen mind seems to have revealed all it can

38:59.620 --> 39:00.620
to me.

39:00.620 --> 39:02.180
Let's keep moving, Richard.

39:02.180 --> 39:03.180
Yes.

39:03.180 --> 39:05.900
You've now gone into all four rooms in this quadrant.

39:05.900 --> 39:07.900
The only door is back into the hallway.

39:07.900 --> 39:08.900
All right, Richard.

39:08.900 --> 39:09.900
Follow me.

39:09.900 --> 39:10.900
Peek your head out there.

39:10.900 --> 39:12.020
Make sure the coast is clear.

39:12.020 --> 39:19.420
When you peek your head out, you see there are four men dragging this limp body behind

39:19.420 --> 39:27.980
them, and each of them are wearing full brown jumpsuits, and they have a large scythe strapped

39:27.980 --> 39:34.100
to their backs, and the blade of each scythe is shaped like an enormous fishhook.

39:34.100 --> 39:35.260
How bloody is it?

39:35.260 --> 39:38.820
None of the fishhooks have any blood on them.

39:38.820 --> 39:40.580
Mm, disappointed.

39:40.700 --> 39:42.540
You might want to take a look at this, friend.

39:42.540 --> 39:43.820
I peek my head out.

39:43.820 --> 39:47.460
When you peek your head out, you notice that the body that they are dragging behind them

39:47.460 --> 39:53.340
is the body of Keith Vigna, and they walk into the elevator, and the elevator door closes

39:53.340 --> 39:54.460
behind them.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.140
Where all does the elevator go?

39:56.140 --> 39:58.700
Anywhere your heart desires.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.300
Hmm.

40:00.300 --> 40:02.540
Like, really, though?

40:02.540 --> 40:05.340
Could I just think about a person I want to see in this building?

40:05.340 --> 40:08.540
I meant within the building's bounds.

40:08.540 --> 40:09.540
Okay.

40:09.540 --> 40:13.420
Do you think we could find Rosemary?

40:13.420 --> 40:14.420
Mayhaps.

40:14.420 --> 40:15.420
Where would she be?

40:15.420 --> 40:16.660
Where's, like, security control?

40:16.660 --> 40:18.820
I believe I could take you there.

40:18.820 --> 40:20.060
It's across the hall.

40:20.060 --> 40:21.060
Let's go.

40:21.060 --> 40:26.380
When you guys go across the hall, there's also a touchscreen, yeah, Scooby-Doo shot

40:26.380 --> 40:31.220
of you guys running across the hall to the other door that looks the exact same, using

40:31.220 --> 40:34.340
the same, what are those called in cartoons?

40:34.340 --> 40:35.860
Frames of animation.

40:35.860 --> 40:36.860
Sure.

40:36.860 --> 40:37.860
Yeah.

40:37.860 --> 40:41.700
It's, like, on a loop of us walking, and...

40:41.700 --> 40:48.700
And you guys do the same thing, where you, like, hack into the keypad, and the door opens,

40:48.700 --> 40:55.340
and inside this door, you walk into a small, empty foyer that leads to two doors, one on

40:55.340 --> 40:57.260
your left and one on your right.

40:57.260 --> 40:58.780
Neither one has a label.

40:58.780 --> 40:59.780
Oh, good.

40:59.780 --> 41:00.780
I don't...

41:00.780 --> 41:02.140
I think labels are generally harmful.

41:02.140 --> 41:03.700
Me as well, friend.

41:03.700 --> 41:04.700
Where...

41:04.700 --> 41:05.700
You guys have so much in common.

41:05.700 --> 41:06.700
Alright, let's not.

41:06.700 --> 41:07.700
I don't...

41:07.740 --> 41:09.740
I'm becoming quick friends with you.

41:09.740 --> 41:10.980
Rich, no.

41:10.980 --> 41:11.980
That's not what's happening.

41:11.980 --> 41:13.660
You know, you took my brother.

41:13.660 --> 41:16.140
You could fill in a little bit here for...

41:16.140 --> 41:17.140
Oh, yeah, sorry.

41:17.140 --> 41:21.940
When you guys walked out into the hallway, they saw you, and...

41:21.940 --> 41:22.940
No, Richard...

41:22.940 --> 41:24.940
And they killed both of you.

41:24.940 --> 41:29.140
Richard's body was still, you know, just limp on the floor.

41:29.140 --> 41:31.300
Just figured I'd remind you of what you've done.

41:31.300 --> 41:35.580
Thank you for making me relive these delicious and horrible memories.

41:36.100 --> 41:38.780
Do you want to go in the left door or the right door?

41:38.780 --> 41:39.780
Left door.

41:39.780 --> 41:42.940
You walk into a room that is long and narrow.

41:42.940 --> 41:47.580
Each wall is made entirely of deep, tall file cabinets.

41:47.580 --> 41:50.940
Above you is only fluorescent lighting.

41:50.940 --> 41:53.260
On the far end of the room is a table.

41:53.260 --> 41:58.660
It looks like a desk but is four feet off the ground and has no accompanying chair.

41:58.660 --> 42:02.660
There is a file open on the standing desk or super wide podium or whatever.

42:02.660 --> 42:03.660
I go to read it.

42:03.740 --> 42:07.660
It's a file that says John Lee Pettymore the Fourth on it.

42:07.660 --> 42:13.660
It shows you as a cocaine supplier, number one, and a contention police officer, number

42:13.660 --> 42:15.100
two.

42:15.100 --> 42:19.740
There's a lot of stuff about the Pettymore family.

42:19.740 --> 42:24.900
Different troubles that cousins and uncles and aunts have all gotten into.

42:24.900 --> 42:27.500
And then there's a manila envelope.

42:27.500 --> 42:32.060
When you open the manila envelope, it's adoption papers.

42:32.060 --> 42:39.700
From Cole's Orphanage, New School Under Modern Etiquette, and the name of the adopted child

42:39.700 --> 42:42.460
is John Lee Pettymore the Fourth.

42:42.460 --> 42:45.180
What?

42:45.180 --> 42:46.900
I pour over the paper.

42:46.900 --> 42:49.220
Does it show my birth parents or anything?

42:49.220 --> 42:50.780
It has your adopted parent's name.

42:50.780 --> 42:52.660
It doesn't have your birth parent's name.

42:52.660 --> 42:55.040
So that's pretty stunning.

42:55.040 --> 42:56.040
How old was Kevin?

42:56.040 --> 42:59.420
He was probably mid-50s, mid-60s.

42:59.420 --> 43:00.420
That's my daddy.

43:01.140 --> 43:03.820
I want to take a look and see if I can find a file for Kevin.

43:03.820 --> 43:12.140
Actually, right underneath the file for John Lee Pettymore, there's a file labeled K-Cell.

43:12.140 --> 43:18.660
Three members of an unknown organization who go by Kyle, Karen, and Kevin.

43:18.660 --> 43:21.260
Kyle is listed as unknown.

43:21.260 --> 43:23.700
There's a blurry picture attached of a man.

43:23.700 --> 43:26.180
The picture is from a security camera.

43:26.180 --> 43:30.400
Karen is listed as Anne Love.

43:30.400 --> 43:36.480
There is a mug shot of a woman smiling a cold, vacant smile behind asymmetrical bangs

43:36.480 --> 43:39.040
covering one of her eyes.

43:39.040 --> 43:42.480
Kevin is listed as unknown.

43:42.480 --> 43:44.080
There is a picture attached.

43:44.080 --> 43:49.240
He's missing the surgical scars and is so much younger and happier than Kevin, the man

43:49.240 --> 43:55.080
you saw earlier, who is now only a hollow shell of the man in this picture, the man

43:55.080 --> 43:59.280
you immediately recognize as your father, John Lee Pettymore the Third.

44:00.720 --> 44:08.600
Okay, so Copperhead Road starts playing by Steve Earle and John Lee Pettymore gets, he's

44:08.600 --> 44:18.160
stunned and he's kind of, the paper is shaking in his hands and he's like, daddy, daddy,

44:18.160 --> 44:20.040
you ain't dead.

44:20.040 --> 44:22.800
The G-Men didn't kill you.

44:22.800 --> 44:23.800
You're alive, daddy.

44:31.400 --> 44:41.920
Also, in this file, there is a miniature tape player with a cassette loaded into it.

44:41.920 --> 44:44.680
I nervously press play.

44:44.680 --> 44:51.680
The cassette begins playing and you hear that whirring of an old recording and you hear

44:51.680 --> 44:58.720
a voice that you just recently met and you recognize as Marvin Glass.

44:58.720 --> 45:07.720
I do not typically reward my adversaries with the honor of joining my family, but if

45:07.720 --> 45:16.880
either of you are willing to give up any information on your associate who stole my property, I

45:16.880 --> 45:21.360
would be willing to let you live.

45:21.360 --> 45:23.240
Fuck you, you goddamn monster.

45:23.240 --> 45:25.040
You and your kind can eat my ass.

45:25.040 --> 45:27.480
No, no, no, please.

45:27.480 --> 45:28.840
How are you doing this?

45:28.840 --> 45:30.720
Kyle, I swear I'm not doing this.

45:30.720 --> 45:33.200
He's controlling my- BANG!

45:33.200 --> 45:42.280
The sound of a gun firing is followed by silence.

45:42.280 --> 45:43.840
What are you?

45:43.840 --> 45:52.200
Tell me how this little ball works and I'll tell you what I am.

45:52.200 --> 45:54.440
The recording ends.

45:55.440 --> 45:58.440
Little ball.

45:58.440 --> 46:00.440
Goddamn.

46:00.440 --> 46:06.440
I guess this mystery is a lot older than December 3rd.

46:06.440 --> 46:10.440
Hey, Rich, did you hear any of that?

46:10.440 --> 46:11.440
Mm-hmm.

46:11.440 --> 46:12.440
What is this?

46:12.440 --> 46:13.440
Yeah.

46:13.440 --> 46:14.440
Sorry, man.

46:14.440 --> 46:24.000
I just heard like some life shit, like my daddy, who I found out is my adopted daddy,

46:24.000 --> 46:27.280
who I thought had died and abandoned me.

46:27.280 --> 46:29.400
He's alive.

46:29.400 --> 46:31.400
He's Kevin.

46:31.400 --> 46:34.800
Oh, interesting.

46:34.800 --> 46:38.520
Were you around- did you work for Mr. Glass at this time period?

46:38.520 --> 46:39.520
Did you know anything?

46:39.520 --> 46:44.000
No, I can't say I was around whenever this was.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.960
Like is this- does it seem- is it like A through Z or whatever?

46:46.960 --> 46:47.960
It's not.

46:47.960 --> 46:48.960
It's all over the place.

46:48.960 --> 46:50.320
Do you want to go ahead and roll a search for me, though?

46:50.320 --> 46:51.320
Yeah.

46:51.320 --> 46:52.920
I've got one thing for you if you roll.

46:53.320 --> 46:55.920
Sorry, it's a zero and a two.

46:55.920 --> 46:57.160
Fuck yeah.

46:57.160 --> 47:01.800
You quickly just rifling through trying to find anything interesting.

47:01.800 --> 47:08.360
There's a bunch of files that are itemized by like number and letter coding, stuff that

47:08.360 --> 47:11.720
doesn't make any sense, but there's one that's just called Satan.

47:11.720 --> 47:14.040
I'd like to read this file called Satan.

47:14.040 --> 47:16.400
Yeah, there's one thing in it.

47:16.400 --> 47:22.320
It's just a picture and it's of a woman with shoulder length curly hair and a mouth that

47:22.320 --> 47:28.840
not only takes up half of her face, but it's showing an amount of unbridled pleasure you

47:28.840 --> 47:36.480
can barely comprehend, and you feel like it might be important later.

47:36.480 --> 47:39.160
This is a deeply unsettling photograph.

47:39.160 --> 47:44.320
It is, and I would like you to roll sanity.

47:44.320 --> 47:45.640
Thirty-one, fail.

47:45.640 --> 47:48.000
Alright, lose one sanity.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Twenty-two?

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
Yes.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.200
I'd like you to roll an alertness check for me, John.

47:52.200 --> 47:53.680
The same age as Taylor Swift.

47:53.680 --> 47:58.560
At least he has a song called Twenty-Two.

47:58.560 --> 48:00.840
Thirty-four on a sixty.

48:00.840 --> 48:02.760
Fuck, I just missed it.

48:02.760 --> 48:03.760
No, no, I passed.

48:03.760 --> 48:04.760
You passed.

48:04.760 --> 48:05.760
Yeah, you passed.

48:05.760 --> 48:06.760
Hell yeah.

48:06.760 --> 48:08.720
You hear the elevator door ding.

48:08.720 --> 48:16.360
I grab Richard Rich, whichever you prefer, Dickie, and throw him behind the table with

48:16.360 --> 48:17.360
me.

48:17.360 --> 48:18.360
I'm like, get down.

48:18.360 --> 48:19.360
Okay.

48:19.720 --> 48:26.040
As you hide, you hear footsteps, and then you hear the door to the foyer that you're

48:26.040 --> 48:33.200
in open, and then you hear someone right on the other side of the door of this room that

48:33.200 --> 48:42.400
you are now in, and the door opens, and Kevin is standing there, dressed in all black, average

48:42.400 --> 48:48.080
build, six feet tall, light brown hair, mustache with a dead stare and scars on his forehead

48:48.080 --> 48:49.600
and neck.

48:49.600 --> 48:57.800
The scars look medical in nature, and he is all gussied up with an assault rifle, a shotgun,

48:57.800 --> 48:58.800
a pistol.

48:58.800 --> 49:01.000
He's wearing body armor.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.760
Body armor that you recognize.

49:03.760 --> 49:05.680
We came in with our body armor.

49:05.680 --> 49:10.960
Yep, and he's holding the assault rifle that you specifically chose to bring to the city

49:10.960 --> 49:12.680
with you.

49:12.680 --> 49:16.400
Nature versus nursery right there, you know what I'm saying?

49:16.400 --> 49:17.400
Woo!

49:17.400 --> 49:23.920
And he starts shooting, and he fires this assault rifle.

49:23.920 --> 49:27.320
We're behind a big solid four foot wide thing, right?

49:27.320 --> 49:33.960
I just motion to Rich, don't make a fucking move, and I'm just hoping he's just firing

49:33.960 --> 49:34.960
blindly.

49:34.960 --> 49:35.960
I don't want to make a move right now.

49:35.960 --> 49:41.280
So he keeps firing and firing, clip empties, you hear it hit the ground.

49:41.280 --> 49:45.840
He loads in another clip, and he starts firing again.

49:45.840 --> 49:48.520
Woo!

49:48.520 --> 49:54.600
And as he's firing, you start feeling this podium chip away.

49:54.600 --> 50:00.720
A few bullets actually whiz through near your heads right in between the two of you.

50:00.720 --> 50:01.720
Okay.

50:01.720 --> 50:07.440
I want to wait until I hear him go through another clip, and as soon as I hear him reloading,

50:07.440 --> 50:11.640
I'm going to kick Richard out into the open.

50:11.640 --> 50:14.080
Fair, fair.

50:15.080 --> 50:17.360
A clip hits the ground.

50:17.360 --> 50:20.240
I kick Richard rolling out behind the podium.

50:20.240 --> 50:26.440
I'm in the fetal position, so I literally roly poly out into the fetal position.

50:26.440 --> 50:30.800
And I'm not saying anything, I'm just hoping maybe he just recognizes one of the guests

50:30.800 --> 50:31.800
and will...

50:31.800 --> 50:40.160
John, you turn to your right and you see the body of Rich Nichols turn into cheese, basically.

50:40.160 --> 50:44.240
It's shredded through with lead flying all the way through it.

50:44.240 --> 50:51.480
I would say roughly 18 shots go through the body of Rich Nichols, and he is flopping about

50:51.480 --> 50:52.940
on the ground.

50:52.940 --> 50:57.940
He shits his pants, he starts throwing up everywhere and gurgling blood.

50:57.940 --> 51:03.400
And as he's gurgling blood, you are my new best friend.

51:03.400 --> 51:08.240
Live, Dammit, live.

51:08.240 --> 51:11.080
Earn this.

51:11.080 --> 51:20.240
All right, so while he's focused on just lighting up Rich, I want to roll around the other end

51:20.240 --> 51:23.140
and take some shots with the noisy cricket.

51:23.140 --> 51:24.680
Roll firearms.

51:24.680 --> 51:26.800
25.

51:26.800 --> 51:27.800
What's your firearms?

51:27.800 --> 51:33.200
My firearms is a 60, that would make it a 40, so I'm good.

51:33.200 --> 51:34.960
Roll 2d10 for damage.

51:34.960 --> 51:36.960
Oh, fuck.

51:36.960 --> 51:40.240
Oh, fuck indeed, that's a noisy cricket, my dude.

51:40.240 --> 51:41.240
Add up the numbers?

51:41.240 --> 51:42.240
Yes, please.

51:42.240 --> 51:43.240
17.

51:43.240 --> 51:44.240
No, wait, no.

51:44.240 --> 51:46.680
Yeah, no, because a 10 is a 10, right?

51:46.680 --> 51:47.680
A zero is a 10.

51:47.680 --> 51:50.280
Oh, a zero is a 10, so eight.

51:50.280 --> 51:51.280
Wait, what?

51:51.280 --> 51:52.280
I rolled a 10.

51:52.280 --> 51:53.280
Oh, yeah, that's a one.

51:53.280 --> 51:54.280
Right.

51:54.280 --> 51:55.280
That's what I'm...

51:55.280 --> 51:56.280
Yeah.

51:56.280 --> 51:57.280
All right.

51:57.280 --> 51:58.280
Or a 71.

51:58.280 --> 52:01.680
710 points of damage.

52:01.680 --> 52:09.640
Eight damage, so you fire at Kevin and he takes it in the shoulder and part of his shoulder

52:09.640 --> 52:16.840
rips away and underneath it you see some sort of, it's not bone, it's some sort of shiny

52:16.840 --> 52:24.600
material underneath his shoulder and he stands firm and begins firing at you as you are firing

52:24.600 --> 52:25.600
at him.

52:25.600 --> 52:26.600
I take my shots.

52:26.600 --> 52:29.940
They turn my daddy into a goddamn mechanical man.

52:29.940 --> 52:37.580
And as you say that, he turns the assault rifle onto you and begins firing, landing

52:37.580 --> 52:40.260
11 points of damage.

52:40.260 --> 52:42.140
That takes me down to one hit point.

52:42.140 --> 52:45.940
At one hit point, the body of John Lee Pettymore hits the ground.

52:45.940 --> 52:49.660
I need you to roll a constitution check to stay conscious.

52:49.660 --> 52:56.500
32 on a 50, so does Khan go down with willpower?

52:56.500 --> 52:57.500
Yes.

52:57.500 --> 52:58.500
Okay, so I fail.

52:58.500 --> 52:59.500
You fail.

53:00.060 --> 53:03.940
Kevin turns a sort of sickly black for you.

53:03.940 --> 53:11.620
The camera pans out and sees Kevin walk over to the body of John Lee Pettymore.

53:11.620 --> 53:21.100
There is no remembering in his eyes and he fires his assault rifle into your chest for

53:21.100 --> 53:29.340
a full clip and the body of John Lee Pettymore is just gyrating on the ground.

53:29.380 --> 53:38.740
The blood is spattering everywhere and Kevin is standing above you with a cold, dead face

53:38.740 --> 53:45.420
with no remorse and no understanding of what he was doing.

53:45.420 --> 53:47.600
That still seems like I couldn't come back.

53:47.600 --> 53:49.260
You said you're going to spend the luck.

53:49.260 --> 53:50.260
Yeah.

53:50.260 --> 53:58.040
The world is dark, but you still feel very much alive.

53:58.040 --> 54:01.800
You actually feel something very specific.

54:01.800 --> 54:09.280
You're moving like go-gurt busting out of a plastic tube by pressure alone.

54:09.280 --> 54:17.720
You feel yourself squeezed out of a dark constricting space onto the cold, hard floor and rolling.

54:17.720 --> 54:23.920
Then your limbs extend from your form and slam into the file cabinet walls on either

54:23.920 --> 54:25.020
side of you.

54:25.020 --> 54:32.020
It gives you the leverage you need to fling your silver, round frame at your target.

54:32.020 --> 54:38.580
As you land, one of your appendages slices into the soft tissue on the back of your dad's

54:38.580 --> 54:39.580
neck.

54:39.580 --> 54:45.660
Another snaps his head forward and you feel the fracture as a third reaches in, gripping

54:45.660 --> 54:52.100
the top of the spine where it meets the head, or the C1 vertebrae, and you rip the entire

54:52.100 --> 54:59.620
spinal cord out of his body in one swift motion, promptly forcing yourself into the

54:59.620 --> 55:06.620
now-vacant spinal column of John Lee Pettymore the Third.

55:06.620 --> 55:08.780
Cool.

55:29.620 --> 55:53.700
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the

55:53.700 --> 55:54.700
walls?

55:54.700 --> 55:55.700
There's no fire at all.

55:55.700 --> 55:56.700
No fire at all.

55:56.700 --> 55:57.700
Fight, fight, street me down Takes me back to where you're from

55:57.700 --> 55:58.700
Don't stop a dying love Don't push on to your own

55:58.700 --> 55:59.700
Don't stop a dying love Don't push on to your own

55:59.700 --> 56:00.700
Don't stop a dying love Don't push on to your own

56:00.700 --> 56:24.700
Don't stop a dying love Don't push on to your own

56:24.700 --> 56:52.700
Don't stop a dying love Don't push on to your own

56:52.700 --> 57:20.700
Don't stop a dying love Don't push on to your own

57:20.700 --> 57:48.700
Don't stop a dying love Don't push on to your own

57:48.700 --> 58:00.700
Don't stop a dying love Don't stop a dying love
