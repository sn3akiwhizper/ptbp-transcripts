0	2000	What is up, my babies?
2000	7000	It is your trustworthy radio DJ father figure and confidant, Wolf the Dog,
7000	13000	and I am here to deliver you the newest of news on the newest and only radio station here in contention.
13000	18000	That is right. You are tuned into 694.2. PTBP.
18000	24000	And I am wet. My love of trash is strong. And I am covered in grease.
24000	27000	You love that, listener. You love it.
27000	31000	And I love this community. A community so trusting and smart,
31000	36000	we decided to build a delta green scenario through prompt-based writing contests.
36000	41000	I, Wolf the Dog, am now announcing the winner of the first writing contest.
41000	44000	Drumroll, please. The winner is...
48000	50000	Congratulations, you.
50000	55000	In the second writing prompt, we will be creating the setting for this scenario.
55000	59000	Join us over at reddit.com slash pretending pod.
59000	61000	Thank you, trusted listeners and friends.
61000	63000	Fuck Mark Zuckerberg.
63000	65000	Fuck Mark Zuckerberg.
65000	67000	Fuck Mark Zuckerberg.
67000	68000	It is the news.
68000	74000	Silas Cole is the best thing that has ever happened to the small, unfortunate town of contention.
74000	77000	You all should give him the respect he deserves.
77000	79000	And do not question his decisions.
79000	82000	The townsfolk who are going missing are not missed.
82000	84000	Maybe they even deserved it.
84000	86000	Trust in Silas Cole.
86000	87000	He gave you lights.
87000	91000	And he is now moving your hair around in a pleasant fashion.
91000	93000	Why would you not trust a man like that?
93000	101000	And now, vocal and instrumental sounds combined in such a way as to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion.
101000	105000	It is the creek rocks with canteen you hear them wolves they howl in.
114000	128000	Can't you hear them wolves howling all around my poor little darling.
128000	133000	All around my poor little darling I'm afraid they'll get my darling.
133000	147000	Can't you hear them wolves howling all around my poor little darling.
147000	152000	All around my poor little darling I'm afraid they'll get my darling.
152000	157000	Can't you hear them wolves howling all around my poor little darling.
157000	164000	All around my poor little darling I'm afraid they'll get my darling.
171000	178000	I was doing some research on hand washing during the old western times.
178000	180000	And just like throughout history in general.
180000	184000	And there's a sentence that I want to read to you guys that stuck out to me.
185000	193000	Though perhaps lesser known, an important pioneer of hand washing was the Vienna based Hungarian obstetrician Ignaz Semmelweis.
193000	196000	Who was alive from 1818 to 1865.
196000	206000	Who realized that laboring women caught perpetual fever from doctors who went straight from the morgue to the delivery room.
206000	208000	Oh no.
208000	210000	No.
210000	211000	Is that real?
211000	213000	They had some crazy fetishes.
213000	218000	It's a good observation Ignaz.
218000	221000	Yeah good job that he was the one that picked up on that.
221000	223000	Oh no I don't think anyone believed him.
223000	227000	They probably stoned him to death outside somewhere.
227000	232000	You mean I gotta wash him after I touch the body? Why?
232000	235000	Then all the juice will be gone.
235000	240000	The dead guy juice is good for the baby's immuno-system.
240000	242000	Immuno-systems.
242000	244000	Yeah. Life ends and life begins.
244000	248000	Well you want to smear a little bit of wisdom on the baby's head.
248000	250000	And say Simba.
252000	256000	You can't breathe water. What if I wash my hands and then touch my face and drown?
259000	269000	Listen. There's probably another study that proves that babies who weren't touched by the hands of a man who had been groping a corpse aren't as successful in life.
269000	271000	So...
271000	273000	I've read those studies.
273000	276000	Yeah I've made them and I've read them.
276000	280000	I wrote the studies and I read them all the time.
280000	281000	For what?
281000	283000	For fun.
283000	284000	For funsies?
284000	285000	For funsies.
285000	288000	For funsies my medical journal that I write.
288000	291000	Which is called For Funsies.
291000	294000	If you had to be a doctor what kind of doctor would you be?
294000	296000	Pussy.
300000	302000	Oh my god.
303000	305000	Is that the medical term?
305000	306000	Yeah.
306000	308000	I don't know. I'm not a...
308000	310000	I'm not a pussy doctor.
310000	312000	I'm not a pussy doctor.
312000	314000	Thomas Cox PD.
317000	319000	Don't you mean PhD?
319000	320000	No.
320000	322000	No? What?
322000	324000	I'd go Cox South.
324000	325000	Cox South.
325000	326000	Ball doctor.
326000	327000	Ball doctor.
327000	329000	Urologist probably.
329000	330000	A pee-pee doctor.
330000	332000	You don't pee out your balls Luke.
332000	333000	Yeah but it's close.
333000	335000	That's where it's stored though.
337000	339000	We're all very good at science.
339000	341000	Zack even a first grader knows that.
343000	344000	That's your pee Zack.
344000	346000	I'm a doctor Zack.
346000	347000	Pee-pee.
347000	349000	And I am here since.
349000	351000	Excuse me what did you say?
351000	352000	Pee-pee.
352000	353000	Pee-pee.
353000	355000	That's what I studied in medical school.
357000	359000	I'm a physical penologist.
359000	361000	A penologist.
361000	363000	I'm a penologist.
363000	366000	I can tune pianos and I can look at your pee-pee.
366000	368000	Well I think I'm a piano doctor.
372000	375000	What is it? You have to have 10,000 hours to be a master?
375000	376000	Yeah.
376000	378000	Yeah you have all kinds.
378000	380000	I'm a 30 times master.
380000	382000	You can be a man in what? A week?
383000	385000	How many hours are in a week?
385000	387000	Five hundred twenty-five thousand.
387000	389000	Five thousand six hundred.
390000	394000	Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred hours.
396000	400000	That's how long it takes to get good at pee-pee doctoring.
400000	402000	You can take that out.
403000	405000	I'm not gonna now.
405000	406000	But he won't now.
406000	410000	You never do it Thomas so I know you won't do it for anyone else.
410000	413000	Is Dr. Pimple Popper, is she a dermatologist?
413000	415000	That's what I would be.
415000	417000	Wait do you like that shit?
417000	419000	Dude I love that shit.
419000	421000	You wanna like fuck with cysts and shits?
421000	423000	Yeah cut them out.
423000	425000	Do you do it to other people? Like are you into that?
425000	428000	Yeah I have. I like doing them on myself.
428000	431000	I admit I like popping my own pimples and stuff like that.
431000	433000	But I don't like seeing it on somebody else.
433000	436000	I don't like pimple popping videos.
436000	437000	Yeah me either.
437000	440000	I'm a proud subscriber of the popping subreddit.
440000	442000	But that's about something else right?
442000	443000	Nope.
443000	446000	We should compare each other's subreddits sometimes.
446000	448000	Mine's extremely boring.
448000	449000	Yeah mine's super boring.
449000	452000	Mine's probably pretty boring too but I bet there would be interesting things we'd find.
452000	454000	Like subreddits we didn't know about.
454000	456000	We got 13 or 30.
456000	458000	Wait what?
458000	462000	13 or 30 it's pictures of people that could be 13 or 30.
462000	464000	I follow that one yeah.
464000	466000	Abrupt Chaos is a pretty good one.
466000	468000	Aged Like Milk is a pretty good one.
468000	469000	I like that one too.
470000	472000	Are yours just like being mean to weird people?
472000	473000	Yeah.
473000	475000	Do you have any like not?
475000	479000	Yeah how many like science, arts, and culture subreddits do you follow?
479000	483000	I follow Animals Being Derps.
483000	486000	Ate the Onion is always a good one.
486000	487000	That one's too depressing for me.
487000	489000	I only follow two subreddits.
489000	492000	Awful Taste but Great Execution and Male Fashion.
492000	494000	Those are the only two.
494000	497000	That's all you need really. It balances you out.
498000	500000	Sometimes I can't tell the difference.
500000	503000	What was it? Awful Taste but Great Execution?
503000	508000	Oh I remember is that where you sent us the weird like McDonald's shoes or whatever?
508000	510000	Oh yeah those were actually dope though.
510000	514000	Yeah the best part is like people arguing about whether or not the thing is actually awesome.
514000	520000	I follow the Pretending to be People subreddit where I issue fan theories.
521000	523000	Will not be silenced.
524000	530000	I follow the Kanye subreddit and the top post right now is
530000	533000	That's Enough Mr. West Please No More Today.
533000	536000	Posted right after that Harriet Tubman shit.
536000	537000	Did you see that?
537000	538000	Oh no.
538000	539000	Yeah.
539000	540000	That was bad.
540000	544000	It's a sad story of mental illness that is a true bummer.
544000	547000	But you know when he gets real bad that he's got an album coming out soon.
547000	550000	Yeah but he hasn't put out good music since Yeezus.
550000	551000	Alright so.
551000	554000	That's not true. Life of Pablo was fucking dope.
554000	556000	Oh I thought.
557000	559000	Don't Refute the Gym Luke.
559000	560000	Yeah.
560000	562000	Well I love Kanye West.
562000	564000	His word is law.
564000	566000	It's the Wild West there aren't anyone else.
566000	568000	It sounded like you called him Kanye West.
568000	569000	Kanye West.
570000	572000	Is that not how you say it?
573000	578000	It's just like a 65 year old white woman doing karaoke to Kanye.
578000	579000	Yeah.
580000	581000	I'd watch that.
581000	583000	I'm trying to think of like the funniest.
583000	588000	The funniest lines of Kanye West that the old white woman could do.
588000	591000	Yeah you probably shouldn't say those so let's dig in here.
591000	598000	Let's gold dig in here to the Old West.
598000	599000	Yeehaw.
599000	600000	Yeehaw.
600000	602000	I'm trying to say that once per episode.
602000	603000	Root and toot and shootin.
603000	604000	Yeehaw.
604000	605000	Hold on before we start.
605000	608000	Cause we haven't gone long enough before we started.
608000	610000	Yeah people love this.
610000	614000	How many times do you think people actually said Yeehaw back in the day?
614000	616000	Well let's find out.
616000	617000	I'm googling.
617000	622000	Two million five hundred and forty thousand three hundred and eighty.
622000	623000	It meant hello and goodbye.
623000	624000	Oh.
624000	626000	So yeah all the time.
628000	630000	Yeehaw means family.
632000	636000	God I want a tattoo that says Yeehaw means family on my back.
637000	640000	And it's stitched with a cowboy hat and boots.
645000	646000	Just now?
646000	647000	Oh no.
647000	648000	Should we all stop?
648000	652000	One two three five six seven.
653000	656000	That was cool we kind of had like a clip clap.
656000	664000	Like horses hooves on the ground right outside of the church here in the 1880 somethings in contention.
664000	665000	Who's on a horse?
665000	667000	You know Jack Pearlman's on a horse come on.
667000	668000	I'm on a horse.
670000	671000	Come on hey mister.
671000	673000	Everett did not bring his horse into town.
673000	674000	He walked in.
674000	679000	I'd like to think that Everett has a very small donkey he rides on.
679000	682000	Can we make that happen?
685000	688000	I'm not going to play unless it's a talking raccoon.
691000	692000	Jesus.
695000	698000	That's a throwback for just the group.
699000	701000	Inside jokes are great for podcasts.
704000	707000	But that did actually happen we had a player say that.
708000	709000	Yeah and Delta Green.
709000	712000	So she was a talking raccoon.
712000	716000	So how do we get out of this?
717000	719000	What kind of horse are you riding Jack?
719000	721000	That is the good question.
721000	727000	I think we established between me and Zach it's a big old brown good solid like work horse.
727000	733000	Not like an agile like racing horse like this one can like carry a wagon around.
733000	741000	Very sturdy beautiful horse named Jeremiah whom I love and I think Jack also loves.
741000	748000	Ephraim has a big brown and white Clydesdale named hey mister.
748000	750000	H-A-Y mister.
751000	752000	Love it.
752000	753000	Love it.
753000	757000	I think that's the horse maybe I have too is the Clydesdale the weird like.
757000	758000	Budweiser horse.
758000	764000	Yeah the Clydesdale is the one you can use in Red Dead but that you would absolutely never ever ride in real life.
764000	765000	Right.
765000	766000	Oh.
766000	767000	They're too majestic.
767000	772000	But mine I'm such a big guy that I've got to have a big old horse.
772000	775000	Okay I don't have that guy I just got a big fun horse.
775000	776000	I'll write that down.
776000	779000	Can you write that down so we don't forget.
779000	780000	Big fun horse.
780000	781000	Big fun horse Jeremiah.
781000	784000	Professor Horace Green did you ride in town?
784000	790000	Yeah he rents a horse from the local livery stable.
790000	791000	Horcery.
791000	792000	Uh huh.
792000	796000	Yeah he's got whatever horse they gave him today.
796000	801000	I'm seated on my horse and I look over at Horace.
801000	803000	Is that animal sick?
803000	806000	It sounds a little hoarse.
806000	809000	Gosh.
809000	812000	And Ephraim slaps his knee and laughs to himself.
812000	814000	God damn it Ephraim.
814000	819000	It's just no it's just a standard American quarter horse and I think it's in fine health.
819000	820000	It was a joke.
820000	821000	I don't follow.
821000	823000	It sounds hoarse.
823000	824000	It's a horse.
824000	825000	Yeah yeah.
825000	834000	Well uh we had a plan to do something right?
834000	836000	Yeah I reckon we were gonna head over there.
836000	840000	And I point to the midpoint between the cemetery and my place.
840000	844000	We were thinking we were gonna see if she dropped off those bodies somewhere.
844000	846000	Are you uh you just walking?
846000	849000	I mean I'll be way behind you guys if I do a walk.
849000	855000	Perhaps you should perhaps you should hop on the back of this man's gigantic Clydesdale
855000	856000	here.
856000	858000	Bobby Custard speaks up and is like.
858000	863000	Would you be okay with with Everett hopping on the back of yours if not you know Everett
863000	867000	Everett there's a good place right here on the back of old Bucky.
867000	872000	Bucky looks like a good place for you to ride and Bucky is a gorgeous black horse.
872000	875000	If you're offering space on Bucky there I'll take it.
875000	879000	And as Everett Pace hops up onto Bucky.
879000	881000	It's it's kind of a slow arduous process.
881000	886000	His old rickety bones getting up there.
886000	890000	I used to be able to ride all over this countryside but now it's hard to get up on.
890000	891000	That's why I keep the donkey at my place.
891000	892000	It's easier to get up on.
892000	894000	It's a little shorter you know.
894000	900000	And a sheepish young girl is approaching as Everett Pace is trying to get up and you all
900000	901000	would know her.
901000	903000	Her name is Elizabeth Connor.
903000	910000	She lives in contention and Judge Cortland you would remember her as a friend of your
910000	912000	deceased daughter.
912000	913000	What's sheepish about her?
913000	915000	Is she like furry?
915000	916000	Woolly.
916000	921000	No when she opens her mouth she's just like.
921000	923000	She has a Serta mattress.
923000	928000	Yeah one of the Serta sheep comes bouncing up to you.
928000	933000	And I won't play if I can't be that Serta sheep.
933000	935000	How close is she to us?
935000	939000	She's approaching right now and she is walking up behind Everett.
939000	942000	Hi there folks.
942000	944000	Hey Lizzie.
944000	947000	Oh hi there Judge Cortland.
947000	949000	It's good to see you.
949000	953000	I don't reckon I didn't mean to cause nothing but.
953000	955000	Speak up.
955000	959000	And she walks right over to Cortland and is.
959000	966000	Yeah I didn't want to say anything with Mr. Cole around.
966000	974000	But this morning I overheard Mr. and Mrs. Cole there arguing something loud and fiery.
974000	979000	And I did hear they were screaming about copper wire.
979000	982000	I heard them talking about it.
982000	988000	Yeah he had some copper wire for those fans but I think it's got something to do with
988000	989000	my copper wire.
989000	996000	Well I heard him yell and he was real angry that she took some.
996000	997000	She took some?
997000	999000	Why did she take some?
999000	1003000	I reckon I don't have any sort of idea.
1003000	1010000	I was just fetching some water and happened over here and when you came in Judge screaming
1010000	1014000	and hollering about how your copper wire had been done taking.
1014000	1016000	I thought maybe.
1016000	1019000	I mean I would hate to think that of the Coles.
1019000	1020000	I don't know.
1020000	1022000	I don't trust any of them.
1022000	1024000	He's always seemed a little off to me.
1025000	1030000	We don't agree about much but on this we definitely do.
1030000	1031000	Creepy little fella.
1031000	1034000	I don't trust a man with pants that big.
1034000	1036000	Never can never should.
1036000	1038000	And Elizabeth's father hollers for her.
1038000	1040000	I better be long now.
1040000	1042000	I just wanted to pass that on to you.
1042000	1044000	Do with it what you will I suppose.
1044000	1046000	Thanks for the heads up Lizzie.
1046000	1052000	And with that she's gone and during that entire conversation Everett Pace was just.
1052000	1062000	Now we got you.
1062000	1064000	Okay now you're back on here.
1064000	1067000	Okay and just don't hold on too tight there.
1067000	1068000	Yep.
1068000	1069000	Okay.
1069000	1072000	Now I think maybe and the crowd is leaving.
1072000	1078000	They kind of do that thing that big crowds do where they're congregating like a congregation
1078000	1079000	in front of the church.
1079000	1083000	So they're all like saying their goodbyes but it's taking them a while to leave and
1083000	1084000	Custard.
1084000	1086000	Alright yeah maybe let's just take a.
1086000	1087000	What?
1087000	1088000	Hey.
1088000	1094000	That's what horses are.
1094000	1100000	Custard delete this if it turns out I asked you about this last time but do you know anything
1100000	1103000	about a local gambler named Thomas?
1103000	1108000	Oh yes actually Thomas was the one in there that disappeared back.
1108000	1110000	Oh six days ago?
1110000	1115000	Well that's right Judge the young lady who just spoke to us mentioned that she overheard
1115000	1120000	the woman she was referring to having having an argument with Miss with Mr. Cole.
1120000	1128000	I also I overheard some of the minors mentioning that Thomas had had gotten in a terrible conflagration
1128000	1133000	with Mr. Cole that they had argued fiercely shortly before his disappearance.
1133000	1137000	I don't know if that's any help to the mystery but there it is.
1137000	1138000	Luke can you hear Thomas?
1138000	1140000	It was very roboty.
1140000	1141000	Shit really?
1141000	1144000	Yeah I was having trouble understanding some of it.
1144000	1147000	I could hear I could like understand what you're saying but.
1147000	1153000	It sounds like you're talking into a big fan with how roboty it is.
1153000	1155000	Still?
1155000	1157000	Yeah.
1157000	1162000	Maybe leave the Zoom call and hop on back in.
1162000	1165000	Yeah that whole time he was talking I was like well I can kind of get it I don't know
1165000	1168000	if we're gonna interrupt and say anything but.
1168000	1170000	I was having trouble following.
1170000	1171000	Hello?
1171000	1172000	Hey.
1172000	1173000	How is it?
1173000	1174000	Still roboty?
1174000	1175000	Still bad.
1175000	1180000	Damn it I was saving that burp for when I talk next time but I'll get another one.
1180000	1182000	Rick and Morty style.
1182000	1184000	Save up all the burps for when you speak.
1184000	1185000	Yeah.
1185000	1187000	Hey Zach what's that shirt you got on?
1187000	1189000	I've never seen it before.
1189000	1193000	I only have like four shirts that I like.
1193000	1194000	Same.
1194000	1198000	I ain't clear this some bitchin' closet on out.
1198000	1202000	Get me some proper western attire so I can get in character.
1202000	1206000	I show up in like a full cowboy garb for the next episode.
1206000	1208000	That would have been fun.
1208000	1212000	We should start doing costumes for the Patreon.
1212000	1213000	Hell yeah.
1213000	1217000	Me and Joe can just wear our weird luchador masks.
1217000	1221000	We play luchadors in every single one shot from here on out.
1221000	1223000	It's the only silly mask I have.
1223000	1228000	There is a worldwide wrestling RPG that looks fucking hilarious.
1228000	1230000	I could be George W. Bush.
1230000	1234000	I have a mask of that.
1234000	1238000	Oh man you should have just been GW for this one.
1238000	1240000	Okay so am I still a robot?
1240000	1241000	Yeah.
1241000	1242000	Yeah.
1242000	1244000	How about now?
1244000	1247000	Still fan.
1247000	1249000	Very roboty.
1249000	1251000	Okay I'm gonna restart.
1251000	1259000	I think it's worse if that helps you at all.
1259000	1261000	I'm stopping my audacity track.
1261000	1262000	Okay.
1262000	1263000	Pause.
1263000	1273000	Yeah let's all just pause it.
1273000	1279000	Five, six, seven.
1279000	1287000	So that's all I know about Thomas.
1287000	1288000	Does anybody know?
1288000	1290000	Go ahead and run it back.
1290000	1292000	I think we got a pretty good one.
1292000	1294000	Oh I'm sure we did but they didn't hear you.
1294000	1295000	They didn't understand you.
1295000	1300000	Oh all that gotcha.
1300000	1307000	Yes well the gist of it is that I overheard some of the miners talking about Thomas and
1307000	1313000	Mr. Cole getting in a terrible argument shortly before his disappearance.
1313000	1317000	And apparently he'd made some kind of great discovery down there.
1317000	1319000	I'm not sure what it was.
1319000	1321000	Thomas had made the discovery or Cole had?
1321000	1323000	Cole makes discoveries every day.
1323000	1326000	Thomas found something in Mr. Cole's mine.
1326000	1327000	What was it?
1327000	1329000	A goo.
1329000	1330000	Like oil?
1330000	1332000	Do you strike oil?
1332000	1334000	Living oil.
1334000	1337000	That sounds like a bit crazy if you ask me.
1337000	1341000	I'm a man of science and I have seen many things.
1341000	1347000	You think maybe they hit like a gas leak or something down there making him feel a little
1347000	1348000	wacky?
1348000	1352000	Judge with all due respect, is there a gas leak in your own home?
1352000	1354000	Why do you do the things you do?
1354000	1358000	He's just got his mouth open unsure how to respond.
1358000	1367000	I like this science guy a lot.
1367000	1374000	Now I don't know much about science and about living goo but I know that you did just roast
1374000	1378000	this man's beans and for that I do applaud you.
1378000	1385000	Now maybe we should be off instead of talking about hypotheticals of living slime and whatnot.
1386000	1388000	Sounds too goofy to me.
1388000	1394000	Yes, I completely agree unless there's anything else that people aren't telling each other
1394000	1398000	that might help us solve this case on the way there.
1398000	1404000	I know this is of limited interest to the rest of you but I would like it to be established
1404000	1410000	scientifically and for all posterity from now in the 1880s that this is a goo.
1410000	1417000	It's called a goo.
1417000	1419000	I reckon I like that a whole lot.
1419000	1421000	We'll name it after young Thomas.
1421000	1422000	Thomas goo?
1422000	1424000	You want to call it the Thomas goo, huh?
1424000	1425000	Thomas goo.
1425000	1426000	No, no, no, no.
1426000	1427000	Bottle that up.
1427000	1428000	Thomas's goo?
1428000	1434000	Of course it will have a name in Latin that will roughly translate to Thomas's goo.
1434000	1436000	Does anyone here know Latin?
1436000	1440000	I actually do, but it would be above you.
1440000	1442000	You wouldn't understand it.
1442000	1444000	You say I just hear static.
1444000	1445000	I'm just sure of it.
1445000	1446000	What's static?
1446000	1453000	Oh, uh, well see Silas Cole found out about electricity and sometimes it makes a weird
1453000	1456000	zzzz noise.
1456000	1458000	Ah, I know some Latin.
1458000	1460000	I know habeas corpus.
1460000	1462000	I don't, I don't think you do.
1462000	1467000	Tell me, go ahead and tell the class what habeas corpus means, Ephraim.
1467000	1473000	Well, speaking of habeas corpus, don't we got some corpuses to find?
1473000	1475000	Let's go.
1475000	1479000	General natural world for those of you who have natural world.
1479000	1483000	Oh shit, I got to find my character sheet.
1483000	1486000	18 on a 40.
1486000	1487000	It's a one.
1487000	1488000	I passed with a one.
1488000	1489000	Hell yeah.
1489000	1490000	Oh, holy shit.
1490000	1491000	Nice.
1491000	1494000	Where are the, I have my character sheet pulled up and I can't find it.
1494000	1495000	There's too many fucking.
1495000	1496000	Oh no, I restarted.
1496000	1497000	God damn it.
1497000	1498000	Oh, thank God.
1498000	1499000	I still have it.
1499000	1500000	Let's get all these things back up.
1500000	1501000	Apologies.
1501000	1502000	Apologies.
1502000	1503000	Y'all need not roll.
1503000	1504000	Okay.
1504000	1507000	We got a one Everett pace.
1507000	1515000	Looking up into the sky, you see three vultures circling about a half mile down the road and
1515000	1517000	right down there, there's a row of homes.
1517000	1525000	Uh, just a little, uh, early idea of a suburb happening down here on the west side of contention.
1525000	1532000	You can just hear these vultures.
1532000	1534000	The vultures are barking?
1534000	1535000	Yeah, a little bit.
1535000	1541000	To seemingly no one, Horace Green pipes up and says, actually, the concept of the suburb
1541000	1543000	dates to the Roman times.
1543000	1548000	Uh, meaning it comes from suburbus, meaning beyond the city.
1548000	1549000	Oh, is that Latin?
1549000	1550000	What?
1550000	1551000	I'm sorry.
1551000	1552000	I was just thinking out loud.
1552000	1555000	And Everett, you would know that that is the sound vultures make.
1555000	1560000	Uh, you just, just like in general, I looked it up.
1560000	1563000	Hey, listen here fellas, them vultures, there's three of them up there.
1563000	1564000	They're barking.
1564000	1566000	I've had vultures follow me around before.
1566000	1571000	Uh, usually take a shower, bath after that, but I've heard them bark.
1571000	1575000	Don't you figure for, uh, if we're looking for bodies, there's a good chance that, uh,
1575000	1576000	they're circling a body.
1576000	1578000	I mean, might as well check there.
1578000	1580000	I think that's a wonderful observation Everett.
1580000	1582000	That's a good start Everett.
1582000	1583000	Thanks everyone.
1583000	1584000	You're welcome.
1584000	1588000	We all love you and cherish you.
1588000	1594000	Which is exactly what Joe had in mind with this character.
1594000	1600000	Horace Green has never heard another man speak that way to a man, much less heard a
1600000	1605000	man get that kind of positive affirmation in his life at this point in the 1880s.
1605000	1607000	So sad.
1607000	1612000	He doesn't know what to do with it, but he feels, he feels all of a sudden like something's
1612000	1614000	missing that he didn't know about before.
1614000	1616000	Oh no.
1616000	1620000	Maybe it'll help him grow to become a better man.
1620000	1624000	He mutters, does the patriarchy hurt men too?
1624000	1628000	Jesus Christ.
1628000	1634000	As we approach and get closer, I want to pull my gun out and try to shoot one of the buzzers.
1634000	1635000	Okay.
1635000	1641000	Everyone roll animal handling except for the judge who does this so often that his horse
1641000	1643000	is used to it.
1643000	1644000	Totally used to it.
1644000	1645000	I don't think I passed.
1645000	1647000	I think you got to roll it for me.
1647000	1649000	I'm not, I'm not controlling this bad boy.
1649000	1651000	How about you roll it for me?
1651000	1652000	Oh.
1652000	1654000	Could I roll ride?
1654000	1656000	Either way, I failed hard.
1656000	1657000	Yeah, same.
1657000	1658000	I rolled a 92.
1658000	1659000	I failed.
1659000	1660000	I failed hard as well.
1660000	1661000	Oh no.
1661000	1662000	What?
1662000	1669000	I put all my points into drive wagon thinking I could just drive us around in a wagon.
1669000	1671000	Your sick party wagon.
1671000	1672000	I should have.
1672000	1673000	Science party wagon.
1673000	1679000	Well, I figured he went out to his dinosaurs bones every day with a little, with a little
1679000	1680000	wagon.
1680000	1686000	So horse green is leading you guys in this wagon that you're all sitting in the back
1686000	1687000	of.
1687000	1690000	Look over there vultures.
1690000	1692000	Thankfully Everett sitting right up front.
1692000	1698000	He notices he's um, no, this, this sucks.
1698000	1703000	Uh, so as soon as, uh, firearms.
1703000	1704000	Oh yes.
1704000	1705000	Absolutely.
1705000	1708000	Oh, please don't quit failure.
1708000	1712000	Firearms are all that you didn't have to roll a second.
1712000	1713000	15 on a 50.
1713000	1714000	Ooh, that's a dead bird.
1714000	1717000	Do you want to describe it as we're riding up?
1717000	1726000	I pull my gun out and ate all my bacon last night and pop, shoot a, shoot a vulture and
1726000	1730000	the vulture, uh, shrieks except for they don't shrink.
1730000	1731000	They bark.
1731000	1738120	It's just like, and it turns over and immediately begins falling to the ground and the other
1738120	1741960	two begin circling just a little bit lower.
1741960	1742960	The horses.
1742960	1743960	Let's see.
1743960	1744960	We got Bucky.
1744960	1745960	We got Jeremiah.
1745960	1746960	Thank you.
1746960	1747960	Yeah, we got Bucky.
1747960	1754000	We got Jeremiah and then the rental, his name's hurts.
1754000	1760400	So you guys can push this role if you would like, uh, on either ride or animal handling
1760400	1770760	in order to try to basically at the apex of this horse trying to knock you off, you can
1770760	1777000	push the role to try something a little bit different to hold on tight and regain control.
1777000	1780600	However, if you fail that role, it'll be a crit fail.
1780600	1782200	The screen doesn't have time to push.
1782200	1787120	He just gets bucked straight off the back of the horse and is suddenly on his backside.
1787120	1793680	Jack Pearlman tries to, to emotionally and mentally connect with his best friend, Jeremiah,
1793680	1798760	the horse, and like hugs really tightly to its neck and tries to whisper into its ear
1798760	1800960	to calm down Jeremiah.
1800960	1801960	It's just me now.
1801960	1802960	Okay.
1802960	1805160	Did you put points into horse whispering?
1805160	1808280	Hell yeah.
1808600	1811600	Natural world, baby.
1811600	1813680	I pa- uh, 58 on a 70.
1813680	1814680	So I pass.
1814680	1815680	All right.
1815680	1818800	And the Everett Pace, uh, we're both kind of hanging on by a thread here.
1818800	1820640	What are you going to do?
1820640	1825200	So I'm really scared to push because if you fail a push, it's a crit fail, right?
1825200	1826200	That is correct.
1826200	1827200	Yeah.
1827200	1828760	Uh, I'm not going to push.
1828760	1829760	Okay.
1829760	1836960	Everett Pace, you fall off and the preacher, preacher, sheriff, Bobby Custard, I forgot
1836960	1837960	his name completely.
1837960	1843240	I dare you forget everyone's favorite character, Bobby Custard.
1843240	1847080	And uh, preacher, sheriff, Bobby Custard falls directly on you.
1847080	1849720	You're going to lose one hit point.
1849720	1855480	And professor horse green, you fall off as well, losing a single hit point and the horses
1855480	1866160	just stay near, thankfully, uh, they kind of trot in circles and Jack Pearlman, you
1866160	1873600	grab on tight and you pull yourself forward, your legs dangling like you're Superman riding
1873600	1874600	this horse.
1874600	1877120	Like I'm doing a sick plank almost on my horse.
1877120	1878120	Exactly.
1878120	1879760	What do you whisper in its ear?
1879760	1882240	None of this loss in translation bullshit.
1882240	1884800	All right, Jeremiah, it's just me and you now.
1884800	1886160	We got this.
1886160	1889140	Come on now, Jeremiah, come on now.
1889140	1893700	And I'm like petting it's under, under its neck like you do with a weird doggy or with
1893700	1894700	your fat cat.
1894700	1902380	And Jeremiah sits down on its butt to where you're standing on the ground and then slowly
1902380	1907260	rises from the back so that you just kind of slide back up on.
1907260	1912740	As a good horse, Jeremiah, I have a sugar cube that I feed Jeremiah.
1912740	1916660	Can you, can you, can you role play that for me please?
1916660	1917660	Yeah.
1917660	1920220	Here, watch what I do.
1920220	1921220	Watch what I do.
1921220	1923040	Hold on Zach, let me get it on back of you real quick.
1924040	1925560	Ooh, I like that.
1925560	1926560	I like it.
1926560	1927560	I certainly don't.
1927560	1928560	I certainly do not.
1928560	1933640	Well, some of us don't like real role-playing Joe and some of us love real role-playing.
1935640	1936640	Oh God.
1936640	1937640	Yeah, that's good.
1937640	1938640	Oh God.
1938640	1939640	Oh God.
1939640	1940640	Are you okay?
1940640	1943800	Did you hurt yourself role-playing as Jeremiah?
1943800	1945560	Did you feel like a horse for a second?
1945560	1948000	Was it hard to take yourself back out of being a horse?
1948000	1949000	Okay, you're Zach.
1949000	1950000	You're Zach.
1950000	1952000	You're Preacher Sheriff Bobby Custard.
1954000	1956000	Everett's laying on the ground.
1956000	1959000	Hold on, while Zach was a horse, he shit all over the place.
1961000	1962000	Let's see it.
1962000	1964000	We'll let him pick that up.
1964000	1966000	Role-play it now.
1966000	1969000	Good thing he ate grass today.
1969000	1970000	Do it.
1970000	1971000	Do it.
1971000	1972000	Shit.
1972000	1973000	Show us your poo.
1978000	1981000	Everett, are you, are you, are you okay?
1981960	1982960	God damn it, Judge.
1982960	1983960	What the?
1983960	1984960	God damn it.
1984960	1987960	I'm holding out a hand for the Sheriff.
1987960	1990960	Looks like you've fallen and you can't giddy up.
1993960	1995960	That was pretty good.
1999960	2005960	I don't got time for this and I ride my horse over to where the bird fell.
2006920	2010920	Everett, you know, there's room on the back of this saddle for another if you'd rather
2010920	2012920	be with someone a little more experienced.
2012920	2014920	Well, that wasn't Bobby's fault.
2014920	2018920	God damn Judge shooting a gun out of nowhere and pissed off all those horses.
2018920	2020920	He should have known better.
2020920	2021920	God damn it.
2021920	2026920	I completely agree and I will say that Jack is a better rider than I am, that's for damn
2026920	2027920	sure.
2027920	2033920	However, not my fault, Judge Cortland, but you know, he kind of does what he does.
2033920	2034920	We can't all agree.
2035880	2040880	Professor Green is watching his horse just run off back to the stable in town, just over
2040880	2041880	the hill.
2043880	2045880	Completely all the way home.
2045880	2046880	Yeah.
2046880	2052880	He's like, uh, well, I, I, I think I need a ride, uh, from, from whoever's, from whichever
2052880	2056880	horse is behind that Mr. Pace does not occupy.
2056880	2057880	All right.
2057880	2058880	It's the bachelor time.
2058880	2060880	Just hand out your rose, Everett.
2065880	2067880	Wait, what?
2067880	2070880	You gotta pick a horse to get on.
2070880	2073880	I thought that, that we were helping each other back onto the horses.
2073880	2075880	Yeah, you're probably right.
2077880	2079880	I'm already, I'm already riding up there with Bobby.
2079880	2083880	I was just giving you another shot if you wanted to get on my horse.
2086880	2089880	Uh, Horace, you can go on, you can go on and get up here.
2090840	2095840	I know you probably don't want to get on Ephraim's and I reached my arm out to like, heave him
2095840	2096840	up with me.
2096840	2097840	Thank you, Mr. Bowman.
2097840	2098840	You're welcome.
2098840	2104840	As you guys are click clacking down this dusty old ass pathway in between some of these houses,
2104840	2110840	large plots of land, but houses closer, maybe a hundred yards apart, give them some space,
2110840	2116840	but not nearly as much as being out a little bit outside of town lends you a lot more room
2117800	2119800	like Pace or Perlman's places.
2119800	2126800	And as you guys are heading on down here, you see that there is a modest wooden cabin
2126800	2130800	with a covered wraparound front porch.
2130800	2133800	There is a watermelon patch out front.
2133800	2138800	To the side, there's a herd of cows nearby on the side of the house.
2138800	2141800	And you guys would know this place is called the Brick House.
2141800	2142800	Ow!
2142800	2145800	B-R-I-C-K-H-A-U-S.
2146760	2147760	Is it mighty mighty?
2147760	2148760	It's mighty mighty.
2148760	2150760	It's the kind you don't take home to mother.
2150760	2152760	That's a super freak.
2152760	2153760	I know.
2153760	2155760	That's my favorite mashup.
2155760	2158760	She's a brick house.
2158760	2160760	The kind you don't take home to mother.
2160760	2164760	And also mashed up are all of these watermelons.
2164760	2171760	You see as you're approaching, every single watermelon in this watermelon patch has been
2171760	2172760	destroyed.
2173720	2179720	And on the front porch, there's a very tall, very buff woman who is crying.
2179720	2181720	She's weeping very openly.
2181720	2186720	And you know that this is Greer Hilfintop Kamonkarno.
2186720	2195720	Big ol' shout out to M from Michigan, a citizen of contention and a $10 level backer tier
2195720	2199720	backer patreon.com slash pretending pod.
2200680	2208680	Thank you M from Michigan for both Greer Hilfintop Kamonkarno as well as the Brick House gym.
2208680	2214680	Before anybody can say anything, Horace Green has never seen this person and he just says,
2214680	2218680	Hello ma'am, have you seen any interesting bones on your property?
2218680	2220680	I...
2220680	2223680	Perhaps now is not the time.
2223680	2225680	What happened to your vegetables?
2225680	2226680	Their fruits.
2226680	2227680	Melons.
2227680	2229680	My melons?
2230640	2232640	They are...
2232640	2234640	They have been completely destroyed.
2234640	2236640	And I...
2239640	2241640	I woke up in the night...
2245640	2248640	Please tie up your horses and come here.
2248640	2251640	The church is perfect.
2251640	2253640	Preach your sheriff.
2253640	2255640	Come here.
2255640	2257640	Hear my story.
2258600	2260600	Where are you from?
2260600	2262600	Contention!
2262600	2264600	Ephraim's already on the ground.
2264600	2270600	He bends over to get the buzzard he shot and he shoves it in a bag on his horse and leads
2270600	2276600	his horse over to the porch and ties the horse up and just kind of looks at her.
2276600	2278600	It was an excellent shot.
2278600	2286600	It has been circling ever since last night when one of my cows, my beautiful, beautiful
2287560	2289560	is completely eviscerated.
2289560	2291560	Like...
2291560	2293560	Like wolves or...
2293560	2295560	They must have been wolves.
2295560	2298560	Can you show me the way to this here cow?
2298560	2301560	Horace, I'm going to need you with me on this one.
2301560	2304560	Well of course, I've always happened to lead my biological expertise.
2304560	2306560	Do I know this woman?
2306560	2308560	Yeah, and she just started...
2308560	2314560	The brick house is a place where people can come work out.
2314560	2316560	Where they can work out?
2317520	2324520	She's a fitness person and she teaches people of all ages and credos here in contention
2324520	2331520	how to do that cool thing where you destroy a watermelon with your thighs.
2333520	2334520	Nice.
2334520	2336520	Oh that sounds fun, I'd like to learn.
2336520	2342520	If only you could because I am all out of watermelons.
2343480	2347480	Since this was supposed to last me through next year, are we just harvest?
2347480	2352480	I'm going to look down at the watermelon patch and search through it to see if there's any...
2352480	2358480	I want to see if there's anything in there that's not just like dirt or leaves or watermelon pulp.
2358480	2361480	Yeah, go ahead and roll.
2361480	2363480	Spot hidden maybe?
2363480	2365480	You could roll spot hidden.
2365480	2367480	You could roll...
2367480	2369480	Archaeology.
2369480	2371480	I'll do spot hidden.
2372440	2374440	50 on a...
2374440	2376440	45, that's a fail.
2376440	2379440	So you're looking around and you see footprints all over this place.
2379440	2381440	Two different sets.
2381440	2382440	How big?
2382440	2386440	Neither large, they're medium to small as far as feet go in the world.
2386440	2390440	Hey, are these your footprints down here, ma'am?
2390440	2392440	No, I have not stepped foot.
2392440	2396440	I looked from the porch but all of them, they have been gone.
2396440	2400440	Boy, it looks like there's been two perps smashing melons.
2401400	2403400	Yeah, there was a fight.
2403400	2405400	A fight?
2405400	2407400	A melon fight.
2407400	2409400	It's two women.
2409400	2411400	You saw them?
2411400	2416400	Yes, it evoked me from my slumber and I got up and I looked and I watched them.
2416400	2419400	They were destroying everything in the melon patch.
2419400	2425400	They were stepping all over it and they had no regard for my watermelons.
2425400	2429400	So you don't think they were here just to smash your property?
2430360	2436360	No, one was catching the other but I cannot believe with how.
2436360	2438360	How?
2438360	2440360	She's shaking her head and she's crying and she's like...
2440360	2442360	I...
2442360	2446360	My distress must have caused me to see things.
2446360	2449360	What did your distress cause you to see?
2449360	2454360	Well, I could have promised at the time.
2454360	2456360	Now looking back I do not know.
2456360	2458360	You know how the mind plays tricks on you.
2458360	2467360	You can create false memories in oneself but it looked to be that woman from the saloon who had gone missing.
2467360	2468360	Kitty?
2468360	2470360	Yes, that is the one.
2470360	2474360	And then there was another girl that she was capturing.
2474360	2476360	She was dressed strange.
2476360	2477360	Like how?
2477360	2483360	Just odd, vibrant colors, shoes made of different material.
2483360	2485360	How old was she?
2485360	2489360	She must have been a teenager of some sort.
2489360	2496360	But this lasso that Miss Kitty was using to catch her, it was magic.
2496360	2498360	What kind of magic are you talking about here?
2498360	2503360	We all know that magic ain't real.
2503360	2507360	I already hung the witches that were hanging around here.
2507360	2509360	I disagreed with that decision personally.
2509360	2514360	Not that I don't respect you, it's just that it didn't seem that they were actually witches.
2514360	2523360	Anyway, I think that this lasso somehow, you know the lights in town, yes?
2523360	2524360	Yeah.
2524360	2530360	This power that moves through them seems to be moving through this lasso.
2530360	2534360	Like some kind of electric lasso of some kind.
2534360	2541360	Yes, it was filed to see and it burned her enough to make quite a smell.
2541360	2547360	Horace, you think someone could handle an electric lasso that weren't hooked up to some big ol' power line?
2547360	2553360	Glad to know Tildy B's doing okay here in the past.
2553360	2554360	Yep.
2554360	2557360	Horace Green, what are you doing during this time?
2557360	2560360	It was Courtland's turn last time, what are you looking at?
2560360	2565360	Horace is looking at a bug that has wandered into his frame of vision.
2565360	2566360	What's it look like?
2566360	2570360	It's a rather remarkable little beetle.
2571360	2572360	Do you really want to know?
2572360	2573360	I do, yeah.
2573360	2575360	No, you don't.
2579360	2581360	Alright, good turn. Jack Pearlman.
2581360	2585360	I was taking Horace with me to go check out the cow.
2585360	2589360	Yeah, and when you get over there you see that there is...
2589360	2591360	You remember last night?
2591360	2594360	Yeah, that's what I was assuming.
2594360	2596360	I'd say it looks a whole lot like that.
2596360	2601360	Jack Pearlman's eyes widen and he looks back at Horace.
2601360	2605360	You ever seen something make marks like this on an animal before?
2605360	2609360	There's a fucking hole in this cow, the size of a bowling ball.
2609360	2613360	Around it there seems to be bite marks.
2613360	2615360	Go ahead and roll biology if you got it.
2615360	2617360	That is not an Old West skill.
2617360	2620360	Go ahead and roll natural world I guess if you got it.
2620360	2622360	Using that one a lot!
2622360	2623360	Is there science?
2623360	2624360	Five.
2624360	2625360	Oh, there's science.
2625360	2628360	Oh, either way you succeed on that roll
2628360	2631360	as you see that these are bite marks
2631360	2633360	roughly the size of a human jaw
2633360	2636360	and roughly in the shape of a human mouth.
2636360	2638360	Horace, I didn't want to...
2638360	2640360	I didn't want to frighten nobody.
2640360	2644360	Well, I hate to frighten you, Mr. Pearlman,
2644360	2647360	but a man did this.
2647360	2651360	Now both of you are all saying it again.
2651360	2653360	Yeah, fail.
2653360	2655360	Horace passes.
2655360	2657360	Jack Pearlman, you just lose one sanity.
2657360	2660360	This sinks in a little harder
2660360	2663360	because this has already happened.
2663360	2667360	Specifically, you've already seen these exact markings.
2667360	2671360	Seeing it for a second time confirms what you saw last night.
2671360	2675360	Horace, I didn't want to shock nobody at the town hall,
2675360	2679360	but this, before I looked at it myself,
2679360	2683360	but something similar to this happened to one of my horses last night
2683360	2685360	and by God, Dandelion,
2685360	2688360	it looked like she just got murdered and ate up
2688360	2691360	by some kind of creature that in the distance,
2691360	2694360	I thought my eyes was playing tricks on me,
2694360	2698360	but you're telling me it's some kind of man that does this?
2698360	2701360	Well, something with a jaw very much like that of a man.
2701360	2703360	What kind of creature did you see?
2703360	2706360	It was so far,
2706360	2709360	it almost looked like some kind of person,
2709360	2714360	but they were so far and they were moving ungodly fast, I'd say.
2714360	2717360	I couldn't even catch up with them before they got into the woods
2717360	2719360	and I was on horseback.
2719360	2721360	And the wounds looked like this?
2721360	2723360	Do you still have the body? I'd very much like to see it.
2723360	2726360	Yeah, she's still on the barn.
2726360	2730360	I put some dirt on her to keep her from the other horses, but...
2730360	2732360	I'm sorry, she's on the barn?
2732360	2734360	She's on top of the barn.
2734360	2736360	How did you get her up there?
2736360	2737360	Trebuchet.
2737360	2738360	Jack Perlman is very strong.
2738360	2740360	My God, what a specimen.
2740360	2742360	Oh, thank you.
2742360	2744360	Strong as a horse. Not that horse.
2744360	2746360	You're an absolute mountain of a man.
2746360	2750360	You make that sludge, Ephraim, look like a sludge.
2750360	2751360	Oh.
2751360	2752360	Got him.
2752360	2755360	Certainly not a noble goo.
2755360	2757360	But yeah, if you need to go take another look,
2757360	2761360	but I'm telling you, it looks an awful lot exactly like this,
2761360	2764360	and I'm assuming this happened to her last night also.
2764360	2769360	Is there any other things I can perceive from this?
2769360	2771360	Is there any tracks nearby?
2771360	2773360	You could roll a tracking or...
2773360	2774360	Is there a spot hidden?
2774360	2776360	I think natural world would still work weirdly.
2776360	2779360	I spot hidden in natural world.
2779360	2781360	You gotta roll as well.
2781360	2783360	I pass, 35 on a 40.
2783360	2787360	You see footprints that are dug in right here on the ground,
2787360	2791360	dug in hard, and they've left a mark.
2791360	2793360	It's weird because shoes don't,
2793360	2797360	typically the tread doesn't have a design on the bottom,
2797360	2801360	but these have a three leaf design.
2801360	2803360	It's like three leaves,
2803360	2809360	and it's got three lines through the bottom of this trefoil,
2809360	2814360	and under it, it says EST 1949.
2814360	2817360	Go ahead and roll the sanity check.
2817360	2821360	This is from the future.
2821360	2823360	God damn it, I failed again.
2823360	2824360	Would anybody make that assumption?
2824360	2826360	It depends on if he fails the sanity check.
2826360	2827360	I failed it.
2827360	2830360	It's from the future.
2830360	2832360	Go ahead and lose one sanity.
2832360	2835360	Horace, do you see these here tracks?
2835360	2837360	Let me just look at them.
2837360	2838360	You're looking at them.
2838360	2843360	Why do you think it says established in 1949,
2843360	2847360	a year that does not exist as far as we know?
2847360	2850360	Probably just the bottom part of the other eight wore off,
2850360	2853360	and it's from 1849.
2853360	2855360	Yeah, maybe you're right.
2855360	2856360	Maybe.
2856360	2859360	And Jack looks a little unsure of himself at this point.
2859360	2862360	Jack, it's perfectly silly to assume otherwise.
2862360	2865360	Yeah, you're probably right.
2865360	2870360	I didn't sleep good last night after Dandelion's passing, but yeah.
2870360	2872360	Yes, the body of your beloved horse.
2872360	2873360	When can I see that?
2873360	2875360	Cutting right back to Everett Pace.
2875360	2876360	What are you up to?
2876360	2881360	He's surveying the watermelon still and talking up to Greer.
2881360	2889360	Miss Hilfentob-Germunkenau, you know that this isn't here a total loss.
2889360	2891360	You can make a fine jelly out of any of this here.
2891360	2893360	I can show you a little.
2893360	2895360	Gathered up here.
2895360	2898360	I mean, you can't be popping them with thighs no more, I guess,
2898360	2900360	but it's still usable.
2900360	2903360	I thought you were talking about the cow.
2903360	2906360	Oh, God.
2906360	2909360	You can make a fine jelly.
2909360	2911360	Beef jelly.
2911360	2913360	Well, that is, I mean, you melt down hooves.
2913360	2918360	That is very kind of you to say.
2918360	2924360	Go ahead and roll either psychology or persuade or charisma.
2924360	2928360	I mean, I'll try to persuade us, I guess.
2928360	2931360	It's just a 10.
2931360	2934360	76, close.
2934360	2935360	Yeah.
2935360	2942360	Everett Pace, you are just as uncaring and otherworldly
2942360	2946360	as they say that you are in town.
2946360	2948360	I must be going now.
2948360	2952360	And she goes into her home and slams the door shut.
2952360	2954360	Well, if you're not going to use it, then I'm kind of.
2954360	2958360	And he starts putting some watermelon in his pockets.
2958360	2965360	Just goo-ing up his pockets with watermelon.
2965360	2969360	And then he'll join the cow inspectors.
2969360	2973360	As he is shoving watermelon goo into his pockets,
2973360	2978360	Ephraim looks at him doing it and bends down and scoops up a little crushed up watermelon
2978360	2980360	and eats it and kind of makes a funny face.
2980360	2984360	And then he pulls his flask out and takes a couple gulps of it
2984360	2987360	and then starts to pee on the side of the house.
2987360	2993360	And after he's done, he follows Everett back to the cow.
2993360	2996360	I hope you die a terrible, terrible death.
2996360	2999360	Yeah, Horace Green walks up behind him and shoots him in the fucking head.
3005360	3008360	It wasn't like a malicious pee, it was just he had to go
3008360	3011360	and this was what was there.
3011360	3014360	It wasn't a malicious pee.
3014360	3016360	Wasn't malicious.
3016360	3020360	Are you saying that Courtland has in his past?
3020360	3021360	Yes.
3021360	3023360	Oh, shit. Oh yeah, right?
3023360	3025360	Delicious pees.
3025360	3029360	I would imagine that like 60% of his pisses are malicious.
3033360	3037360	Malicious and delicious because you know this guy's got diabetes for sure.
3037360	3039360	That sweet pee.
3039360	3042360	Sweet human oil.
3044360	3049360	Does yours come out as oil and float on the top of your toilet water?
3049360	3053360	Sign of a healthy kidney.
3053360	3055360	Sometimes.
3055360	3057360	It's like extra virgin olive oil.
3061360	3065360	I've got to shake the toilet bowl up for it to be a uniform yellow.
3065360	3067360	I regret.
3070360	3075360	Yeah, Ephraim takes his sweet piss on the lady's house and walks back.
3075360	3076360	Oh boy.
3076360	3078360	What a foul man.
3078360	3080360	As Everett's walking up on you guys.
3080360	3083360	Boy, it sure sounds like Miss Kenny had herself a night.
3083360	3086360	She was up here and then she was at the cemetery, she was up at my place.
3086360	3088360	She's been running all around.
3088360	3094360	And she dragged a woman with bizarre clothes around with an electric lasso.
3094360	3097360	Sounds to me like we got two people stringing up now.
3097360	3106360	Hey Everett, did you have anything that was living eviscerated on your property at all?
3106360	3108360	Like this here cow.
3108360	3114360	If you want to look at it, I wouldn't recommend it personally because it hurt my brain when I did.
3114360	3120360	But you could look at it if you wanted to, but you could just trust me that it looks real bad.
3120360	3122360	No, I don't reckon I did.
3122360	3124360	I saw her out there and I run her off.
3124360	3128360	Mr. Pace, you're absolutely sure you saw nothing last night?
3128360	3133360	100%, I mean I saw Miss Kitty trying to dig up my wife, but no, nothing other than that.
3133360	3139360	Okay, because I had one of my horses get real messed up, similar to this,
3139360	3144360	and I just needed to know if it happened to you two, we could put something together maybe.
3144360	3146360	Figure out what's going on.
3146360	3149360	Ah, nothing. I think I just got there in time.
3149360	3151360	Jack, which horse was it?
3151360	3153360	It was Dandelion.
3153360	3154360	Oh god damn.
3154360	3156360	Beautiful, beautiful god damn horse.
3156360	3159360	I always wanted Hamister and her to get something we could sell.
3159360	3162360	That wasn't going to happen, but she was a beautiful horse.
3162360	3164360	I miss Dandelion already.
3164360	3166360	What do you think happened here?
3166360	3174360	Horace told me that, Horace, why don't you tell them what your science tells you about what could have possibly happened here.
3174360	3186360	Well, by the distance between the upper and lower parts of the bite, the dentation, the depth of the wound, all signs point to a human jaw.
3186360	3189360	You think Miss Kitty did this?
3189360	3190360	I don't know.
3190360	3194360	Now it sounds like Miss Kitty was with someone else.
3194360	3201360	Now do we know that maybe this someone or something else is the cause of all this?
3201360	3210360	I mean, when she was over there digging up the grave over by my place, she was in a tizzy. She had a frenzy to her.
3210360	3217360	Maybe she got bit. Maybe she got bit by a snake or something and rattled her up in there.
3217360	3219360	Made her eat a cow?
3219360	3221360	I've seen it do worse to worse.
3221360	3223360	What?
3223360	3226360	You've seen it do worse to worse?
3227360	3240360	Horace, you ever heard of something like that? Some kind of disease that makes you go wild and be able to murder a horse and a cow in one evening and outrun another horse?
3240360	3246360	Well, why certainly. All sorts of maladies affect man's mind and can drive them insane.
3246360	3251360	Yeah, but I'm talking like speed and such and viciousness of the jaws.
3251360	3261360	When the body becomes hyper excited, it has the power to ignore pains that might otherwise hobble it.
3261360	3270360	And so under immense strengths, a man is capable of great feats of strength and speed.
3270360	3274360	But I'm talking outrunning a goddamn horse here.
3274360	3280360	Not like outrunning another person. I'm talking grade A, beautiful horses that I raised.
3280360	3287360	Mr. Perlman, science would suggest that the most obvious answer is a slow horse.
3287360	3292360	You talking about Jeremiah like that? Look at Jeremiah and you tell what you think about him.
3292360	3299360	And when you look over at Jeremiah where he's tied up at the post at the entrance to the brick house,
3299360	3306360	you see Preacher Sheriff Bobby Custard is across the road in between a couple houses
3306360	3315360	and he's looking off at a trail that leads in the southeasterly direction out of town.
3315360	3320360	And he comes walking back with his head slunk down.
3320360	3324360	None of y'all had tracking, is that right? None of y'all is getting good at tracking?
3324360	3328360	I think it was established that you are quite the trackster.
3328360	3335360	Yep, so I went ahead and took care of it for you and turns out it seems like one person
3335360	3343360	dragged some body, I guess, through this way, threw him on top of a horse
3343360	3347360	and the horse, it just trotted on right off.
3347360	3352360	Going about, you know, pretty quick pace, quick clip, heading on down this path here
3352360	3355360	and this path only leads to one place.
3355360	3356360	Yeah, that's handy.
3356360	3365360	And you all know that it leads to the southeast part of town, which is where the new mine resides
3365360	3373360	and it also happens to be the property on which Silas and Mary Cole live.
3373360	3377360	I haven't been here long, but if I'm not mistaken, it leads straight to the coal land.
3377360	3380360	It does indeed, over there by the mine. That's right.
3380360	3382360	I'm sure he had something to do with this.
3382360	3391360	Yeah, I've always felt uneasy about him and this is making me feel uneasy, so he's probably up to something, right?
3391360	3398360	Custer, can we get on in there? It's legal, right, for sheriffs to do that if there's things to look at and such?
3398360	3404360	Well, we can certainly go just ask him questions. We just need to follow these railroad tracks here straight to the mine.
3404360	3409360	We could go under the pretense of me asking about my copper wire.
3409360	3412360	I mean, you are a judge. You can sign a warrant.
3412360	3420360	If there's two people in this town that could walk into any property here in contention, I'd say they're sitting on these fine horses right here.
3420360	3425360	It's the judge and the sheriff and, you know, also the priest is here as well.
3425360	3427360	I'm also the doctor.
3427360	3428360	Oh, no.
3430360	3432360	Is he good at any of them?
3432360	3433360	Nope.
3436360	3438360	I bet he gives a decent service.
3438360	3439360	Forty percent.
3441360	3442360	In preaching.
3468360	3469360	Get my daughter.
3478360	3486360	Can't you hear the wolves howling all around my poor little darling, all around my poor little darling?
3486360	3488360	I'm afraid they'll get my darling.
3488360	3496360	Can't you hear the wolves howling all around my poor little darling, all around my poor little darling?
3496360	3499360	I'm afraid they'll get my darling.
