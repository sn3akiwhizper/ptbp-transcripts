0	8000	Welcome one and all to Contentions best radio station that is currently hijacking the radio waves of the city.
8000	14000	And now I am hearing that we are also the city's best radio station as well.
14000	16500	Well would you look at that y'all.
16500	20500	This is your radio pirate ship captain Wolf the dog.
20500	28000	And I'm here to steer all y'all's doubloons so I can buy myself a mini fridge for my new apartment here in the city.
28000	32000	This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from NZO.

50000	53000	Hey Mr. Dog, how you doin'?
53000	55000	I feel like nobody asks you that.
55000	60000	I would like to send a shout out to my lovely second half, Ryanna.
60000	67000	She really isn't big into tabletop games, but the moment she heard this gem of a show, she was all ears.
67000	70000	And she thinks everyone is doing a terrific job.
70000	77000	Just wanted to tell her thanks for being my number one, even when I can be a real number two.
77000	79000	I guess that's really it.
79000	83000	So I will re-ask my initial question. How you doin'?
83000	86000	You know, I've been alright, can't complain.
86000	92000	Rent here in the city is a little nuts compared to the old basement back in contention.
92000	95000	But otherwise, everything has been okay, I guess.
95000	99000	I do miss the rats back in the basement sometimes.
99000	105000	Those tasty, delicious little morsels of meat.
105000	107000	Mmmm.
107000	115000	Anyway, as I've been getting settled into my new place here in the city, I have fallen behind on the latest happenings.
115000	119000	So here is an exceptionally intimate version of the news.
119000	123000	The other day, I was walking my dog, Wolf.
123000	130000	And we ran into a little old homeless lady pup getting a nice little snack at a dumpster that I frequent.
130000	135000	Now this little old lady dog took a liking to my dog, Wolf.
135000	140000	And y'all, it looks like my little old boy has fallen for a city girl.
140000	147000	Or it could have been the fact that she was covered in ranch dressin' that was getting my boy all riled up for love.
147000	148000	Who can say?
148000	153000	Please remember, my friends, we got ourselves a Patreon now.
153000	155000	The link is in the show notes.
155000	160000	And if you can't support us financially, please tell a friend about the show.

168000	174000	But no matter who you are, turn up the volume and clap on the three and four.
174000	179000	It's kudzu with no backbone.
194000	208000	Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
208000	209000	It's been a while.
209000	210000	It's been a while.
210000	211000	Been a while.
211000	214000	But it has been a while since I've said sorry.
214000	215000	I'm realizing now.
215000	217000	You can say it to me now if you want.
217000	218000	Okay.
218000	219000	Clark.
219000	220000	Oh, fuck.
220000	221000	I mean, Joe.
221000	223000	See, I'm already here.
223000	224000	I'm already ready to go.
224000	225000	Already there.
225000	227000	I'm already rearing to go, baby.
227000	229000	In situ.
229000	234000	We have another special guest with us this week, and it is Taylor.
234000	235000	Hi.
235000	236000	You've met me.
236000	237000	I'm Taylor.
237000	239000	Taylor, are you having a summer?
239000	241000	Oh, you know I'm having a summer.
241000	245000	If you haven't seen that video, go watch Have a Summer by...
245000	247000	Howard Kramer.
247000	249000	Do he and Kulop still do that one podcast they did?
249000	250000	He still does it.
250000	252000	I think it's called Who Charted.
252000	253000	Yeah, that's it.
253000	254000	But she's not on it anymore.
254000	255000	Gotcha.
255000	256000	She got busy.
256000	258000	She started writing and producing and all that.
258000	259000	Yeah.
259000	260000	Taylor, do you have anything to plug this week?
260000	263000	I'd like to plug my career.
263000	266000	Go be a teacher and mold young minds.
266000	267000	Do the teach.
267000	268000	It's the only way we move forward.
268000	272000	Do you like the smell of pubic hair and having your eyes rolled?
272000	275000	Wait, what?
275000	279000	The smell of pubic hair?
279000	280000	Yeah.
281000	282000	Wait, what?
282000	283000	Armpit hair.
283000	288000	She is currently lifting up her arm and pointing at her armpit.
288000	289000	Your pubic hair.
289000	292000	I can't wait for this to be cut later.
292000	294000	There's not a chance this will be cut.
294000	295000	No, I don't.
295000	297000	This is absolutely staying in.
297000	300000	I think there's a rule against me talking about my students' pubic hair.
300000	303000	Yeah, I was about to say, we might be in legal territory at that point.
303000	305000	I really like my job.
305000	307000	Well, at least you've been armpit hair.
307000	308000	Let's jump.
308000	309000	I love that.
309000	310000	You should be a teacher.
310000	313000	If you like the smell of pubic hair, you should be a teacher.
313000	314000	And don't we all?
314000	316000	Take a look deep within yourselves.
316000	318000	That's cool, yeah.
318000	319000	You could also become a priest.
319000	324000	All right, so let's dive into the episode this week.
324000	325000	Clark.
325000	329000	A thick fog obfuscates your vision.
329000	330000	It's heavy.
330000	333000	The air, like gravity, is somehow stronger than usual.
333000	339000	A whisper in your ear sends shivers down inside your spine.
339000	341000	The voice is familiar.
341000	344000	A stainless steel door appears in front of you,
344000	347000	opening so near your nose you feel a drop in temperature
347000	349000	as the cold metal swings by.
349000	354000	A woman begins screaming behind you.
354000	357000	And when you turn around, you see the face of Tildi B. Mitchell
357000	359000	on a television screen.
359000	362000	She begins repeating herself over and over.
362000	371000	Bonus round, bonus round, bonus, bonus round, bonus round, bonus round.
371000	373000	And then you are running down the street.
373000	374000	You recognize this street.
374000	376000	You live up here on the left.
376000	379000	A familiar boy is about to walk into the house.
379000	384000	You begin to scream, and you are surrounded by this thick fog.
384000	391000	Your screams begin to echo infinitely into the sheer endlessness engulfing you.
391000	400000	And then you hear a voice, and you look up, and you see,
400000	404000	well, Taylor, why don't you tell us what Clark sees?
404000	410000	Clark is about to see his one life mentor, a one Gerald Fingerson,
410000	412000	in front of him.
412000	415000	And how is he looking these days?
415000	416000	Handsome as ever, I say.
416000	417000	Handsome as ever.
417000	418000	Reiterated.
418000	419000	What's he wearing?
419000	426000	Well, I wanted that experience to be just between me and Clark.
426000	428000	Gerald and Clark.
428000	429000	What he's wearing?
429000	430000	Mm-hmm.
430000	434000	Okay, so the listeners aren't allowed to know?
434000	438000	He's a little bit older, as is Clark.
438000	444000	But Gerald, he's one who ages so gracefully that it almost looks like he's younger.
444000	453000	He has lost a little bit of his hair, but he's like the most handsome, balding, old librarian you've ever seen.
453000	455000	Does he still have those tats?
455000	457000	He never talked about tats, did he?
457000	459000	Yeah, he had tats all down his arm.
459000	460000	I think he was wearing a-
460000	461000	Secret tats?
461000	462000	He was wearing a sweater vest.
462000	463000	He was wearing a sweater vest with-
463000	464000	Oh, did we make some-
464000	465000	Mm-hmm.
465000	468000	He was wearing a sweater vest with no shirt underneath.
468000	469000	Yeah.
469000	472000	And I foisted upon you that he had tattoos beneath.
472000	473000	Mr. Rogers.
473000	474000	Anyway, he's looking good.
474000	476000	Mr. Finkerson ain't looking tight.
476000	478000	That's how you speak now?
478000	480000	That's Clark's new character voice.
480000	482000	Gerald is very disappointed.
482000	488000	And Taylor, on this crisp December morning, Clark Bishop is wearing his underwear.
488000	491000	What kind of underwear does Clark wear?
491000	492000	Tighty-whities.
492000	493000	Yeah, yeah, non-stop.
493000	498000	And he is also wearing a t-shirt from a gas station called Pump and Dump.
498000	499000	Good.
499000	500000	Woo-hoo.
500000	508000	Now, Clark, when you look down and see that, you realize that you are also not wearing any shoes or socks.
508000	513000	And it's like December 6th, and it is quite cold outside.
513000	517000	It's strange because you feel absolutely incredible.
517000	522000	The past few days have been exhausting and non-stop.
522000	525000	But you feel better than you felt in a very long time.
525000	531000	So I'm going to need you to take your hit points and willpower all the way back up to full.
531000	533000	Holy shit.
533000	534000	Which takes you to what?
534000	536000	My hit points go up to 26.
536000	537000	That's my max.
537000	539000	And willpower, you said?
539000	540000	Willpower as well.
540000	542000	That brings me up to 12 is my max.
542000	543000	Congratulations.
543000	546000	You feel unstoppable.
546000	547000	Woo.
547000	549000	Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.
549000	558000	And Clark, around your wrist is a string that's attached to a bag of ice with a metal rod sticking out of the top.
558000	566000	And this bag of ice is leaking red down the driveway the two of you are standing on.
566000	574000	The suburban home this driveway belongs to looks exactly like all the other homes on this street with one key distinction.
574000	578000	The mailbox says Jim Cook.
578000	579000	Oh shit.
579000	580000	So you're standing there.
580000	583000	You've got this string around your wrist, bag of ice connected to it.
583000	589000	Bag of ice is leaking red down the driveway, metal rod kind of sticking up out.
589000	594000	And you notice that there's also like a little, there's something else in the bag of ice.
594000	597000	Where's Mr. Fingersen situated in the world?
597000	599000	He's just sitting.
599000	600000	He's holding your hand.
600000	603000	Yeah, he's holding your hand.
603000	605000	Mr. Fingersen?
605000	609000	My dear boy, you look a little different than I saw you last.
609000	613000	Where are we? How'd I get here?
613000	617000	Boy, we've been here for 40 years.
617000	619000	I'm only 37, Mr. Fingersen.
619000	622000	I know. I like to joke with you, my boy.
622000	624000	I thought that was our little banter.
624000	627000	We walked here from the park. Don't you remember?
627000	628000	I don't, Mr. Fingersen.
628000	630000	What do you remember, my boy?
630000	636000	I remember a room and there were cages and I fought, I fought, I fought, I fought a kid.
636000	642000	And then I saw my partners and they were, they were shooting and fell in the crowd and they were...
642000	645000	And did you save them, boy?
645000	648000	I don't, I don't know. I don't know.
648000	650000	What do you suppose we shall do now?
650000	657000	I pull the ice bag toward myself. Can I open it without, without losing any contents?
657000	658000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
658000	659000	I peek in. What do I see?
659000	667000	Peeking in, you see this metal rod goes down into the bottom of the ice bag and it is surrounded by ice.
667000	670000	So you just got the top of the rod, just the tip.
670000	676000	Up against like the side of the bag on the inside, up against some ice, there is a small canvas bag.
676000	680000	So is the metal rod just a metal rod? Is there any markings on it or anything?
680000	685000	It doesn't look like it. Go ahead and roll intelligence for me real quick.
685000	689000	Oh boy, it's a roll. It's the first roll in a while.
689000	699000	Now for the listeners, I, I failed to call for rolls quite often in these last two little mini sessions with the other two boys.
699000	704000	And by mini sessions, I mean full episodes as how they turned out. And...
704000	709000	So he's going to give me a lot of rolls with a lot of chances of failure.
709000	712000	Setting Clark up for failure is what I do best.
712000	715000	That one I passed on though. I got a 10 on a 55.
715000	721000	Congratulations, Sue. When you look at this rod, you flash back to being in that cage.
721000	729000	And you recognize this metal rod that's shoved inside this bag of ice is from the cage that you were in.
729000	732000	It was one of the bars that was on the cage.
732000	735000	And I'm, and I'm tied to the bag?
735000	739000	You just have a string around your wrist. It's just, it's not tied to you necessarily,
739000	742000	but you know, the string at the top of a bag of ice, like a little rope thing.
742000	743000	Got it, got it, got it.
743000	745000	Your hand is just kind of through it.
745000	746000	Like the drawstring?
746000	747000	Yeah, exactly.
747000	749000	You said it's dripping red, like presumably blood?
749000	750000	Presumably.
750000	753000	Mr. Fingersen, does this, does this look like blood to you?
753000	758000	My boy, I've only seen blood once in my life, but it does appear that way.
758000	762000	I lift up my shirt and I'm looking for scars on myself and I'm turning around and it's like,
762000	764000	Mr. Fingersen, is there anything on my back? Am I hurt?
764000	765000	You look amazing.
765000	769000	As you lift your shirt up, you lift it right above your chest.
769000	776000	You see right, almost in the middle of your chest, but just a little bit off stage left,
776000	782000	there is a gaping hole that goes all the way through you.
782000	784000	Do you see anything, Mr. Fingersen?
784000	787000	Nothing too out of the ordinary.
787000	793000	Perhaps that donut hole in the middle of you could have be filled in with some cluck.
794000	796000	Go ahead and roll sanity for me real quick.
796000	798000	It hurts right here.
798000	802000	Not so much here, not so much here, but right here.
802000	807000	A 51 on, you said sanity roll, currently is 26.
807000	808000	That's a failure.
808000	809000	All right.
809000	813000	Yeah, I would say a hole running through your body.
813000	818000	You feel fine, but you're going to take half a D6 of sanity loss on that.
818000	819000	Oh, shit.
819000	822000	You know, because there's a hole through your body.
822000	823000	I rolled a five.
823000	824000	Okay, that's three.
824000	827000	You lose three sanity taking you down to?
827000	828000	23.
828000	829000	Woo!
829000	830000	My breaking point is 18.
830000	837000	So as you look at your chest, you see that the skin actually moves from each side of
837000	847000	the hole down into your body and creates this gelatinous cartilage walled tunnel that runs
847000	848000	through you.
848000	855000	And you can actually put your fingers in and as you press in to the skin that is technically
855000	858000	inside of you, but is not because it's a tunnel.
858000	860000	So it's outside of you still somehow.
860000	864000	It just feels like an ear, you know, or like a nose.
864000	869000	It's just that that cartilage kind of hard lumpy.
869000	870000	That skin covering it all?
870000	871000	Skin's covering it all.
871000	873000	Cluck, are you in pain?
873000	874000	It doesn't hurt.
874000	877000	It's like my body got a gauge, you know, like in your ears.
877000	878000	Yes.
878000	881000	It seems you've become quite a badass.
881000	883000	It's pretty cool.
883000	885000	You want to touch it?
885000	886000	Not particularly.
886000	889000	I try to not touch anymore.
889000	890000	That's probably good life advice.
890000	892000	Perhaps we should go inside.
892000	895000	I was actually just on my way to go see my dear friend Jim.
895000	898000	We have cashew chicken on Sundays together.
898000	899000	Jim.
899000	900000	Jim Cook.
900000	901000	Yes, of course.
901000	902000	Why are you here?
903000	904000	Mr. Fingers.
904000	912000	And I don't know why I'm here, but we found out earlier in the week that Jim Jim's dead.
912000	914000	Well, that can't be.
914000	917000	Jim is my dearest friend.
917000	922000	Once you stopped visiting me at the library is the only one I had left.
922000	925000	I'm sorry to be the one to tell you, Mr.
925000	926000	Fingers.
926000	931000	But we get it on good authority that he was found dead in an alley.
932000	933000	Okay, well.
933000	939000	At precisely this moment you notice that there is a man walking swiftly toward you.
939000	947000	And he is wearing one of those full windbreaker outfits that's like purple and green and black and white.
947000	950000	And like straight out of the 80s.
950000	958000	And he is walking quite briskly and he's got these little goggles on that seem to make him more wind resistant.
958000	964000	And as he approaches you he flips the goggles up onto his forehead.
964000	965000	Hey fella.
965000	966000	Hey.
966000	967000	Hey.
967000	968000	Hey fella.
968000	970000	What can we do you for here?
970000	974000	You seem to be maybe a bit out of place.
974000	975000	What's going on here?
975000	977000	Do I recognize this person at all?
977000	978000	Not even a little bit.
978000	980000	I like your aesthetic.
980000	983000	I certainly do appreciate you saying that sir.
983000	988000	But I'm far more concerned about what you're maybe doing out here on this property.
988000	989000	Oh god.
989000	994000	And he looks down and he sees the red going down the driveway and he's like, what?
994000	995000	Oh god.
995000	996000	What happened there?
996000	997000	That's no good.
997000	1002000	It's a jello experiment is what Mr. Fingerson told me.
1002000	1003000	Oh a jello.
1003000	1004000	Who's Mr. Fingerson?
1004000	1005000	This year Mr. Fingerson.
1005000	1006000	Oh that's me young man.
1006000	1007000	And you are sir?
1007000	1008000	Oh I'm Ken.
1008000	1009000	It's good to meet you Ken.
1009000	1010000	It's good to meet you as well.
1010000	1012000	And your name was?
1012000	1014000	Clark Bishop.
1014000	1015000	Clark Bishop.
1015000	1021000	And he pulls out his phone and he types and he says Clark Bishop.
1021000	1023000	Okay that is, you know what?
1023000	1025000	That is good information.
1025000	1034000	So basically what we have here is you Clark Bishop not necessarily belonging in this neighborhood.
1034000	1036000	Would Clark know where Jim's house is?
1036000	1037000	Jim Cook's house is?
1037000	1039000	Just from his, are we in contention?
1040000	1044000	Oh no you would know that Jim Cook lives in the city.
1044000	1045000	Gotcha.
1045000	1046000	Suburbs.
1046000	1048000	Now sir you will not talk to my son that way.
1048000	1052000	Now we will be on our way and you can go do some more briskie boys.
1052000	1057000	The man Ken, his eyes get real wide and he backs up.
1057000	1059000	Okay you know what?
1059000	1062000	I think I better just go then.
1062000	1066000	I guess have a good day.
1066000	1068000	Alright okay then.
1068000	1074000	And he puts his goggles, he flips them right back down onto his eyes and he bails.
1074000	1076000	He briskly walks.
1076000	1077000	That was exhilarating.
1077000	1080000	I've never talked to someone so harshly before.
1080000	1082000	You were on your toes though Mr. Fingers and thanks.
1082000	1085000	You know I've been doing extra wrist curls recently.
1085000	1087000	It must have shown in my muscles.
1087000	1089000	He was intimidated I'm sure.
1089000	1090000	Yes.
1090000	1094000	Now I have had a hard time processing what you've said about Jim but you know what I
1094000	1096000	always say about a good researcher.
1096000	1099000	If you don't see something first hand how could you possibly believe?
1099000	1100000	Let's go inside.
1100000	1103000	I think getting off the street either way is a good idea.
1103000	1105000	Let's see if the door is open.
1105000	1107000	Mr. Fingerson?
1107000	1111000	Mr. Fingerson did you just happen upon me here in the driveway?
1111000	1113000	How'd you find me?
1113000	1115000	It seems like me a coincidence.
1115000	1117000	I don't know why you're here boy.
1117000	1125000	So let's go ahead and as we watch Clark Bishop and Gerald Fingerson walk toward the house
1125000	1129000	let's go ahead and talk about the changes in Clark Bishop as a character.
1129000	1130000	Yeah.
1130000	1131000	So you died.
1131000	1132000	I died.
1132000	1134000	I had a great fall.
1134000	1136000	And you spent 30 luck?
1136000	1138000	Yeah I spent 30 luck to avoid death.
1138000	1140000	So how much luck are you at now?
1140000	1143000	That puts me at 45 according to my sheet here.
1143000	1144000	45 luck.
1144000	1145000	Alright.
1145000	1152000	Basically as I explained in the last episode I have given each of these boys two talents
1152000	1157000	from the Pulp Cthulhu rulebook and Clark chose...
1157000	1160000	I chose one of them called Endurance.
1160000	1164000	Oh yeah so that's a Constitution bump so...
1164000	1165000	I'm heartier.
1165000	1172000	Much heartier at a time such as this and actually how we're going to do that in this game is
1172000	1175000	I'm going to give you a plus 40 on your Constitution.
1175000	1177000	So what was your Constitution before?
1177000	1179000	My Constitution was 65.
1179000	1181000	So now it is 105.
1181000	1182000	Nice.
1182000	1189000	So on a Constitution check you will still be able to crit fail on a 100.
1189000	1193000	Past that it's going to be all successes unless you're disadvantaged in some way.
1193000	1194000	Super cool.
1194000	1195000	Super duper cool.
1195000	1198000	And then you chose another one as well.
1198000	1204000	I chose Quickdraw which essentially makes it so that I am faster to a fight.
1204000	1207000	In jargon it gives me a higher initiative roll.
1207000	1213000	Yeah so typically I think in Pulp Cthulhu it boosts your initiative roll but here in
1213000	1219000	Delta Green we don't actually roll initiative unless it seems like a fun thing for me to
1219000	1220000	do at the time.
1220000	1226000	So what we are going to do for Quickdraw is put Clark at the top of the order in every
1226000	1234000	combat scenario and I'm going to let you spend 10 luck to act twice at the top if you would
1234000	1235000	like to.
1235000	1236000	Oh wow.
1236000	1243000	Now I believe yesterday in world Clark Bishop hit a breaking point and the last breaking
1243000	1249000	point that you hit we had discussed Clark Bishop needing to express his anger through
1249000	1254000	violence on a daily basis otherwise he would wake up the next day with a reduced amount
1254000	1255000	of willpower.
1255000	1260000	We are going to go ahead and take that idea and push it to excess.
1260000	1265000	So what's going to happen is every time you roll a sanity and you fail but that roll would
1265000	1272000	also fail power so if I ask for a sanity roll if you fail that roll but you also fail
1272000	1273000	power which what's your power at?
1273000	1274000	60.
1274000	1279000	60 so if you roll over 60 on a sanity check not only are you going to lose that sanity
1279000	1283000	but you're also going to immediately lash out physically.
1283000	1285000	Ooh that's awesome.
1285000	1287000	So glad I'm the only one around here.
1287000	1291000	Yeah and that he said he was going to make me roll a bunch.
1291000	1292000	Exchange.
1293000	1295000	Get your things in order Gerald Fingersen.
1295000	1298000	I'm always ready.
1298000	1299000	For the grave.
1299000	1300000	That's rude.
1300000	1302000	Just cause I'm old doesn't mean I'm near the grave.
1302000	1306000	I'm a sprightly 67 now I'm probably like 80.
1306000	1309000	I think you said you were 19 in the last one.
1309000	1312000	I'm funny.
1312000	1317000	I wrote sanity over 60 equals bad on the side of my character sheet.
1317000	1321000	So that's going to be something that I think would be fun if we didn't talk about at the
1321000	1324000	table and you just do as a character.
1324000	1325000	Okay.
1325000	1331000	I will say like and Joe did that sanity roll also fail on power and if so then I'm not
1331000	1334000	going to say okay then I'll take control of your character or anything like that.
1334000	1335000	I'll just do it.
1335000	1336000	Yeah just go for it.
1336000	1337000	Okay.
1337000	1338000	And get weird with it.
1338000	1339000	I love it.
1339000	1340000	Love it love it.
1340000	1344000	Do I have to inflict harm or can I lash out in other ways?
1344000	1349000	I would say lashing out at a being of some sort would be unnecessary.
1349000	1350000	Okay.
1350000	1353000	Sorry this sounded maybe like I said unnecessary.
1353000	1355000	I'm physically to a being necessary.
1355000	1357000	Oh he can't just like verbally berate me.
1357000	1359000	He has to hit my face.
1359000	1361000	Yeah that makes sense.
1361000	1363000	I don't know.
1363000	1364000	I'm a librarian.
1364000	1367000	The power of words is more powerful than the power of fists.
1367000	1369000	Yeah I mean yeah you can think that.
1369000	1371000	You've been doing those wrist curls though you'll be alright.
1371000	1372000	You're right.
1372000	1373000	You're right.
1373000	1374000	I'm ready.
1374000	1378000	Come at me young boy.
1378000	1385000	Checking the front door of Jim Cook's house Clark feels the knob just open right up and
1385000	1386000	the door swings open.
1386000	1387000	Let's go in my boy.
1387000	1395000	As you walk into this house the house smells kind of old but in a calming familiar way
1395000	1398000	and there's an upright piano in the entryway.
1398000	1404000	The living room has papers and binders strewn all over the coffee table, couch, chairs,
1404000	1405000	the floor.
1405000	1409000	Really everywhere in the living room there's just papers and binders and papers and binders
1409000	1415000	and the sun still low in the sky because it's early morning is shining in through the window
1415000	1420000	illuminating a fair amount of stagnant dust that is just hanging there.
1420000	1427000	I was thinking about a way that we could investigate this house in a fun way and came up with a
1428000	1435000	kind of new idea that we've never done before so I'm going to have Taylor and Joe fill out
1435000	1442000	a quick form off mic and it's going to be of the mad gab style.
1442000	1443000	Persuasion.
1444000	1445000	What's mad gab again?
1445000	1447000	Is that the fill in the adjective, the noun?
1447000	1448000	Yeah.
1448000	1449000	Okay cool.
1449000	1450000	Stoked.
1450000	1451000	We'll be right back.
1451000	1452000	Holy shit cool.
1458000	1460000	Well it seems like Jim's dead.
1460000	1463000	Would you like to hear me play Mary Had a Little Lamb?
1463000	1465000	It was his favorite song.
1465000	1469000	Yeah sure sure sure Mr. Fingers.
1469000	1473000	Ding dong ding dong ding ding dong.
1473000	1479000	I make my way toward where I think a bedroom might be and want to find some pants.
1479000	1483000	You immediately find some pants that are sitting out on the bed.
1483000	1485000	Are they anywhere close to my size?
1485000	1486000	Go ahead and roll luck for me.
1487000	1489000	Uh oh.
1489000	1491000	That's a critical fail.
1491000	1493000	A 55 on a 45.
1493000	1494000	Oh.
1494000	1495000	Geralt hides in the closet.
1495000	1497000	What could we put in Clark's...
1497000	1498000	No no no.
1498000	1500000	Not a sainted hero.
1500000	1501000	Oh right right.
1501000	1504000	So Geralt hides in the closet.
1504000	1505000	Geralt goes home.
1507000	1515000	Looking at these pants they're actually, they are quite tight as you put them on and as
1515000	1523000	you pull them on they grab onto your leg hairs and pull up and they are basically capris
1523000	1524000	on you.
1524000	1525000	Yeah totally.
1525000	1530000	So now you are wearing capris, no shoes, no socks, and a shirt from...
1530000	1531000	Pump and Dump.
1531000	1534000	That is correct yes the Pump and Dump.
1534000	1536000	Yeah I'm looking real swell.
1536000	1537000	Yeah just nailing it.
1537000	1544000	So as we said before I wanted to do the investigation of this house very odd and quick moving.
1545000	1551000	To basically lay out the information for you and let you do with it what you will.
1551000	1558000	Basically all of these solo episodes are meant to get the three boys back where they might
1558000	1559000	need to be.
1559000	1561000	The boys are back in contention.
1561000	1563000	The boys are back in contention.
1563000	1564000	Exactly.
1564000	1570000	So Clark you begin looking floppily around the house.
1570000	1573000	And on the fridge you see a picture that catches your attention.
1573000	1575000	It's a picture of your parents.
1575000	1581000	They are posing with silly hats and another man who is begrudgingly smiling.
1581000	1582000	Have I seen the picture before in my life?
1582000	1585000	You've never seen this picture before in your life.
1585000	1588000	Do I know who that third man is or the third person?
1588000	1589000	Jim.
1589000	1593000	You would recognize him from some of the other pictures you've seen in this house.
1593000	1594000	It is Jim Cook.
1594000	1597000	It's old Jimmy boy.
1597000	1602000	In my little notebook I was writing Jimmy boy.
1602000	1605000	It's good to take thorough notes.
1605000	1613000	Serendipitously scouring for more information you see a chest cavity of drawers.
1613000	1615000	The cavity was a joke to you.
1615000	1616000	You could have just said chest of drawers.
1616000	1618000	Chest of drawers and open it.
1618000	1623000	Inside is a ziplock bag containing two small items.
1623000	1624000	A single tarot card.
1624000	1628000	It's the devil with several bullet holes in it.
1628000	1629000	Wow.
1629000	1632000	And a taxidermied baby squirrel.
1632000	1633000	Baby squirrel.
1633000	1635000	Is there anything with the squirrel?
1635000	1637000	There is nothing with the squirrel.
1637000	1639000	Can I look at the bottom of its base?
1639000	1641000	Does it have any signature?
1641000	1645000	Do taxidermists put a signature on their taxidermied?
1645000	1647000	Of course Zach.
1647000	1649000	Of course they do Zach.
1649000	1652000	You know that Joe is from a long lineage of taxidermists.
1652000	1654000	Taxidermists.
1654000	1656000	It's in his blood.
1656000	1658000	I would say probably not.
1658000	1660000	But maybe there's one there.
1660000	1662000	All of that is in a ziplock bag?
1662000	1664000	The tarot card alongside the squirrel?
1664000	1665000	Yeah.
1665000	1667000	It's a taxidermied baby squirrel.
1667000	1669000	It's a sandwich size bag.
1669000	1671000	So the baby squirrel.
1671000	1674000	The squirrel baby is the devil.
1674000	1677000	Canonically Clark is a fan of taxidermy?
1677000	1678000	I believe he is.
1678000	1680000	Can he tell the craftsmanship?
1680000	1682000	Is it Julie Maxwell's craftsmanship?
1682000	1685000	Go ahead and roll intelligence for me.
1686000	1688000	That is a pass.
1688000	1690000	Oh shit.
1690000	1691000	Fuck.
1691000	1692000	It's not a pass.
1692000	1693000	Don't lie.
1693000	1694000	It's a 56 on a 55.
1694000	1696000	He can't see you.
1697000	1698000	Never lie to me.
1698000	1699000	I will know.
1699000	1701000	I lie to Zach all the time.
1702000	1703000	It's our special little game.
1703000	1706000	It's what keeps our marriage healthy is secrets.
1706000	1707000	That's a good foundation.
1707000	1709000	Summer secrets.
1709000	1711000	Oh you know I'm having a summer.
1712000	1717000	You cannot tell the origin of this taxidermied squirrel.
1717000	1720000	However, as you continue to blindly search for more,
1720000	1723000	you look behind the couch and hiding behind there,
1723000	1726000	you can see a leather holster for a firearm.
1726000	1729000	There isn't a gun, but there is a small bit of text
1729000	1731000	tooled into the leather.
1731000	1733000	Tooled into the leather.
1734000	1736000	Tooled into the leather.
1736000	1737000	Tooled into the leather?
1737000	1739000	Tooled into the leather.
1739000	1753000	It says Scientia Mors Est, which is S-C-I-E-N-T-I-A space M-O-R-S space E-S-T space.
1753000	1758000	And then underneath it, it has a dash and then the letter uppercase K.
1758000	1760000	And that's in the leather on the holster.
1760000	1761000	It is indeed.
1761000	1767000	And this one really made me happy with the way that the mad gab worked out.
1767000	1775000	Stupidly going through his bathroom, you find a ring in a pile of abandoned pubic hair.
1777000	1778000	Thank you Taylor.
1778000	1782000	It is smooth and silver with a little plateau on top.
1782000	1786000	It is completely smooth with no markings on it whatsoever.
1786000	1791000	When you say a plateau on top, it's presumably like the base of where something would sit maybe?
1791000	1794000	It doesn't look like it. It looks like it's just rounded right up to the top
1794000	1800000	and then where it would be on the top of your finger, it is just a flat plateau.
1800000	1808000	Moving throughout the rest of the house, you see that in the living room with all the papers and binders and stuff all over the place,
1808000	1811000	you see two notebooks that are sitting out.
1811000	1818000	One is leather and thick and it has a symbol on the front you have come to recognize.
1818000	1823000	It has a big circle surrounded by six smaller circles.
1823000	1828000	The other notebook is thin and red and it looks familiar.
1828000	1829000	Oh.
1829000	1831000	Go ahead and roll Luck for me.
1832000	1834000	That's a pass. That's a 35 on a 45.
1834000	1835000	Alright.
1835000	1842000	Walking over, you take a look at this thick leather book and it has this girthy wooden bookmark.
1844000	1845000	Girthy.
1845000	1846000	Girthy wooden bookmark.
1846000	1847000	Girthy.
1847000	1860000	And as you open it, it takes you to nearly the back of the book and written over and over on this ancient parchment is the phrase,
1860000	1870000	it is only through death that he may rise again and death is capitalized and he is capitalized.
1871000	1876000	Can I flip forward in the book some and see is it all handwritten or is some of it printed?
1876000	1877000	It's actually weird.
1877000	1884000	So before you can flip the book at all, drawn over this obsessive scroll,
1884000	1891000	like drawn over it is a picture of a hooded figure with a brilliant light shining from its maw.
1891000	1900000	So all the text is in the background and in the foreground is this hooded figure with this big light where its mouth is.
1900000	1903000	It's drawn though. It's not an actual light emitting from the book, is it?
1903000	1904000	It's not, no.
1904000	1909000	But as you try to flip the book toward the front, go ahead and roll luck for me.
1910000	1914000	That's a critical success. 33 on a 45.
1914000	1918000	Oh my God. That is incredible.
1921000	1924000	All the secrets of the universe are revealed to you in an instant.
1925000	1931000	So as you flip this, as you flip this, yeah, I wasn't planning on giving you this.
1932000	1939000	As you flip the book back through, you see there's a note stuck in it in between these two pages
1939000	1944000	and it kind of flits out as you go through the book and the book closes immediately.
1944000	1949000	It almost unnaturally, so you can't get to any of the other pages,
1949000	1959000	but this little piece of paper flips out this envelope and inside the envelope is a letter, a handwritten letter.
1959000	1962000	You can see very clearly at the bottom it's signed by Jim Cook.
1963000	1970000	In this letter, Jim Cook refutes, quote, the revelation of the overseer,
1970000	1975000	calling it the, quote, scratches of a broken man.
1975000	1980000	The letter then goes on to outline new guidelines,
1980000	1987000	including the immediate reassignment of all members of the disposal unit.
1988000	1993000	So A is the envelope addressed and B is the, is there a greeting to anybody at the top?
1993000	1998000	So at the top of this letter, it actually has the logo, the logo,
1998000	2003000	the symbol with the circle surrounded by the six circles and it says,
2003000	2007000	faith through knowledge is just called knowledge.
2007000	2008000	Nice.
2008000	2010000	I need you to roll luck for me.
2013000	2015000	A fail. 75 on a 45.
2015000	2020000	And with that, you hear the hammer of a gun click.
2020000	2028000	Oh no. I got my hands up, but still, I guess, carrying the bag with the rod.
2029000	2035000	Hands up, wearing your capris and your shirt from a gas station,
2035000	2041000	hands up, holding up this bag of ice that is still dripping faster and faster red,
2041000	2044000	just all over this house, just red everywhere.
2044000	2046000	We should investigate that.
2046000	2048000	Yeah, I should look into that bag a little more.
2050000	2055000	Capri pants, first priority, second priority, blood bag.
2056000	2063000	Clark, what the fuck are you doing in my daddy's house?
2068000	2070000	And it is chief Maggie Cook.
2070000	2071000	Oh my God.
2072000	2076000	Margaret, do not talk to my adopted son that way.
2076000	2078000	He's the only thing in my life.
2080000	2082000	Maggie, is it you?
2082000	2085000	Clark is, he might be crying.
2085000	2089000	He might have a tear running down his eye right now and his hands are lowering.
2089000	2090000	Is her gun lowering?
2090000	2092000	Her gun is lowering as your hands lower.
2092000	2098000	Gerald is half standing in front of him because he doesn't actually want to die,
2098000	2101000	but he wants to show allegiance towards Gerald in this situation.
2101000	2104000	I mean, I'm sorry, towards Clark in this situation.
2104000	2105000	Absolutely.
2105000	2106000	Well, in himself.
2106000	2108000	Actually, that was an accurate statement both ways.
2110000	2112000	Maggie, I don't, I'm sorry, chief.
2112000	2113000	You can just call me Maggie now.
2113000	2117000	Clark starts to compose himself a little more, stands up a little straighter,
2117000	2119000	but still is so slack-jawed.
2120000	2123000	Maggie, I thought you died.
2123000	2124000	I thought you were dead, Maggie.
2124000	2127000	Yeah, I'm pretty confused here as well.
2127000	2129000	I start walking toward her and I'm trying to hug her.
2129000	2130000	Okay.
2130000	2134000	Gerald continues to like put himself in between the two,
2134000	2137000	so he's sort of like shuffle-stepping forward.
2137000	2143000	She awkwardly walks toward you and engages in one of the more awkward hugs
2143000	2145000	that's existed on this show.
2145000	2146000	Sandwich hug.
2146000	2150000	And Gerald has never felt so much warmth and love in his life.
2150000	2152000	You've got one arm in between us.
2153000	2158000	No, I mean, half my frail body is in there, too.
2158000	2160000	It's the size of one arm, though.
2160000	2161000	I pull away from the embrace.
2161000	2165000	Maggie, I swear to God, Joe doesn't remember.
2165000	2166000	Did I see her body?
2166000	2167000	Did I ever see her body?
2167000	2171000	Maybe you would have seen the charred remains.
2171000	2172000	Let's say I did.
2172000	2174000	Maggie, I saw your body.
2174000	2178000	You were dead, and saying that out loud freaks Clark out a little bit,
2178000	2181000	so he recoils and gets a little further away from her.
2181000	2185000	This is just like an Edgar Allen Poe poem.
2186000	2187000	Chief Maggie Cook.
2187000	2189000	Well, just Maggie Cook.
2189000	2191000	She's not wearing her uniform,
2191000	2195000	and this is maybe the first time you've seen her not in uniform in years.
2195000	2196000	Yeah.
2196000	2199000	And now you only saw, I mean, you saw her five days ago.
2199000	2202000	You were celebrating her birthday, but since then you've already mourned her.
2202000	2206000	But she's just wearing like black jeans and a hoodie,
2206000	2211000	and she kind of walks toward you and walks kind of past you a little bit
2211000	2214000	and grabs the red notebook that was sitting out.
2214000	2216000	She kind of thumps it on one of her hands.
2216000	2219000	Clark, have you been looking around here?
2219000	2221000	What did you come here for?
2221000	2223000	Do I remember what color Drew gave her?
2223000	2225000	Drew gave her a yellow one, I believe.
2226000	2229000	Maggie, I'll be honest.
2229000	2231000	I'm missing, I've got some gaps.
2231000	2234000	I actually don't know how I ended up here at this moment.
2234000	2235000	Mm-hmm.
2235000	2236000	Mm-hmm.
2236000	2239000	And she pulls her finger out, and she kind of reaches towards you,
2239000	2243000	and she pokes at your chest and feels it give.
2243000	2245000	Hmm, what happened there?
2245000	2248000	I don't, I don't, I don't know, Maggie.
2248000	2249000	I lift up my shirt and show her.
2249000	2250000	She steps back.
2253000	2254000	Okay.
2256000	2257000	All right.
2257000	2261000	Clark, I've been waiting a long time for this.
2262000	2264000	I've been waiting a real long time for this.
2264000	2266000	You need to come with me immediately.
2266000	2267000	What's her demeanor?
2267000	2268000	Excited.
2268000	2269000	Happy or afraid?
2269000	2270000	Both.
2270000	2272000	Has she acknowledged Mr. Fingersen at all?
2272000	2273000	No.
2273000	2275000	Which I find very rude.
2275000	2276000	Uh, fuck.
2276000	2278000	Where, uh, okay, where is she motioning toward?
2278000	2280000	Like, when she said come with me?
2280000	2282000	Was she walking out of the house or somewhere else into the house?
2282000	2283000	No, she was just standing.
2283000	2288000	Uh, Maggie, uh, I mean, where, where do you, where have you been, Maggie?
2288000	2289000	Clark.
2289000	2290000	Clark.
2290000	2291000	Now wait just one second.
2291000	2293000	You won't tell us what to do.
2293000	2295000	Clark, what should we do?
2295000	2297000	Clark, is everything okay?
2297000	2299000	Oh, shit.
2299000	2302000	You know Maggie always was a bitch.
2304000	2305000	She's ignoring me right now.
2305000	2307000	Don't listen to her.
2307000	2308000	Mr. Fingersen.
2308000	2309000	Yes?
2309000	2310000	Stop for a second.
2310000	2311000	Clark.
2311000	2312000	I don't know about this, Maggie.
2312000	2314000	I don't trust her.
2314000	2315000	Listen to me.
2315000	2316000	I point at Mr. Fingersen.
2316000	2318000	I'm talking to Mr. Fingersen, Maggie.
2318000	2320000	And she takes a couple more steps back.
2320000	2321000	Okay, Clark.
2321000	2327000	I think she's ignoring me just because one time I charged her extra for a late book.
2327000	2332000	She wouldn't acknowledge that she didn't turn back in because of Winn-Dixie.
2332000	2337000	I am staring very scared at Mr. Fingersen right now, and I turn back to Maggie.
2337000	2338000	Clark.
2338000	2339000	Yeah, Maggie.
2339000	2340000	He knows what's at the mill.
2340000	2345000	You keep looking at Geralt every time he's talking, and she keeps saying, what, what
2345000	2348000	in the world do you keep looking over there for?
2348000	2352000	And she's looking over there too and just in bewilderment, and she's very confused.
2352000	2358000	Clark, don't you remember all our good times together at the library when I tried to teach
2358000	2360000	you how to read at a first grade level?
2360000	2364000	I start walking toward Mr. Fingersen, and I hold out my hand.
2364000	2365000	Can I touch him?
2365000	2371000	As you walk toward Mr. Fingersen, I think he probably backs up, and then you continue.
2371000	2374000	You have that dead wrong narrator.
2374000	2378000	I want nothing more than to hold hands with Clark.
2378000	2387000	As Geralt Fingersen holds out his hand to grab yours, you reach out and grasp onto nothing.
2387000	2389000	Fuck.
2389000	2392000	Clark.
2392000	2393000	Clark has freaked the fuck out.
2393000	2395000	I need you to roll sanity.
2395000	2398000	My sweet baby boy.
2398000	2399000	Stay with me.
2399000	2400000	Hold on.
2400000	2401000	I pass.
2401000	2402000	An 18 on a 23.
2402000	2405000	And with that, Geralt Fingersen dissipates.
2405000	2408000	Oh, shit.
2408000	2413000	I think that freaks Clark out in and of itself too, that he's now lost the thing that was
2413000	2414000	kind of helping him at this moment.
2414000	2417000	What about cashew chicken sundae?
2417000	2418000	Okay, I'm done.
2418000	2420000	What about cashew chicken sundae?
2420000	2421000	Yeah.
2421000	2425000	As he floats, he just turns into dust.
2425000	2429000	Actually, no, as Mr. Fingersen is disappearing, Clark is going, no, no, no, no.
2429000	2431000	And he's gone.
2431000	2434000	Clark, are you with me?
2434000	2435000	Are you here?
2435000	2438000	I turn very solemnly to Maggie.
2438000	2440000	Yeah, I'm here.
2440000	2441000	I'm here.
2441000	2442000	All right.
2442000	2443000	Get your head straight.
2443000	2444000	We got a lot of work to do.
2444000	2446000	Maggie, I'm leaking pretty bad here.
2446000	2449000	I'm going to get some ice and fill up this bag just to be safe.
2449000	2450000	Yeah, okay.
2450000	2451000	What's in there?
2451000	2454000	I don't know exactly, but it looks like blood coming out of it.
2454000	2457000	If there's ice around it, I assume they were trying to preserve it in some way.
2457000	2460000	Frankly, I'm afraid that it's the hole in me, Maggie.
2460000	2461000	Oh my God.
2461000	2462000	Oh my.
2462000	2465000	And she begins to move some of the ice around.
2465000	2467000	She wants to see what's in there.
2467000	2468000	I let her.
2468000	2475000	Okay, so she starts moving the ice back away and moving down around this metal rod that's
2475000	2476000	in there.
2476000	2478000	It's a hollow metal rod that's in there.
2478000	2484000	She moves enough ice out of the way that you both look down and you see a heart.
2484000	2486000	Yeah, I was afraid of that.
2486000	2490000	That has been impaled by this rod straight through the heart.
2490000	2494000	And when she sees that, she goes, that explains quite a bit.
2494000	2496000	She goes, all right, we're on a time crunch.
2496000	2497000	I'll be in the car.
2497000	2502000	I go to the freezer and I crack all the ice trays that I can.
2502000	2503000	He's probably only got a couple.
2503000	2504000	He's just got two.
2504000	2506000	He's a normal American.
2506000	2508000	He's got two ice trays.
2508000	2510000	I throw those in the bag.
2510000	2512000	I crack them up and dump them in the bag.
2512000	2517000	Okay, so you go outside and Maggie Cook's car is out there.
2517000	2519000	What would Maggie Cook be driving now?
2519000	2523000	I'm nervous that we've said before what she drives off duty.
2523000	2524000	I think we said a Bronco maybe.
2524000	2529000	I think she had a truck, but that truck is still wherever it would have been.
2529000	2531000	She's in new wheels now.
2531000	2539000	So I'm going to put her in a silver Camry, just a real common car.
2539000	2544000	And as you guys are driving out of the suburbs of the city
2544000	2549000	and what you would know as toward the mill outside on the other side of the city,
2549000	2553000	you guys are in the car just sitting in complete silence.
2553000	2557000	Clark wants to look in the little canvas bag that's inside the ice bag.
2557000	2561000	I guess next to my heart, next to a heart that I think is my heart.
2561000	2564000	Next to a heart that you could reasonably.
2564000	2567000	Hey, that looks like my heart.
2567000	2570000	I recognize this heart. It's familiar.
2570000	2572000	I feel like it's been inside me.
2572000	2579000	When you grab this canvas bag that is cold and wet and it's got a little blood on it, this is it.
2579000	2584000	Oh, he just handed me a small canvas bag in real life. Oh my God.
2584000	2586000	I'm opening it.
2586000	2593000	It looks like little tiny puzzle pieces maybe, little pieces of cardboard.
2593000	2597000	Little pieces. Oh, there's letters on the backs.
2597000	2600000	Okay. It's going to spell a word, I believe.
2600000	2607000	I guess I can just tell you as I see them, S-T-L-E-N-R and a symbol.
2607000	2611000	The symbol is a square with a circle in the square.
2611000	2613000	It's a stlearner.
2613000	2616000	I figured it out, Zach. It's stlearner.
2616000	2620000	You get a hundred luck. You nailed it.
2620000	2630000	Yeah, in the car you pull this bag out and you look at what's inside and it is these cut pieces of this material
2630000	2636000	with a coloration on one side and letters on the other with a symbol.
2636000	2638000	Joe knows what these are and I think Clark does too.
2638000	2639000	Hit me with it.
2639000	2643000	They're the letters they give you in the final round of Wheel of Fortune.
2643000	2646000	It's missing the I though and the I might be the symbol.
2646000	2648000	Are you sure about that, Joe?
2648000	2657000	Clark is making that too. Clark is like, these are those letters that they always give you at the end of Wheel of Fortune.
2657000	2662000	I'm going to give you ten luck for getting that so fast.
2662000	2664000	Fuck yeah.
2664000	2665000	So what's that put your luck up to?
2665000	2667000	I got 55.
2667000	2672000	And you guys are in the car just sitting in complete silence.
2672000	2681000	Maggie, can you tell me why are you alive?
2681000	2686000	I saw you were kind of standing by my dad's old book.
2686000	2689000	Yeah, that leather book.
2689000	2696000	It's got some real importance for me and people like me and soon to be people like you.
2696000	2700000	There's a prophecy in there, Clark.
2700000	2706000	And that prophecy is the revelation of the overseer.
2706000	2715000	And what it says is that it is only through death that he may rise again.
2715000	2725000	We believe the overseer is coming and he's going to set an order in the world and I've been preparing his way.
2725000	2729000	That's what we do at the Circle of Knowledge.
2729000	2737000	Well, not only that, we're also fighting on the forefront to keep this world safe from the unnatural that's on the other side.
2737000	2747000	And Clark, I was against it at first and she kind of breaks a little bit and she's much more comfortable now talking with you.
2747000	2755000	And she's like, I didn't I didn't believe in the way things were going and I didn't understand.
2755000	2760000	But now I'm I'm starting to understand a little bit more about how the world works.
2760000	2764000	You know, it's fire that keeps this world going.
2764000	2769000	You know, it's it's fear. People can't handle that knowledge, Clark.
2769000	2777000	Most people. But you can. I can. We can. People like us. People in the Circle of Knowledge.
2777000	2785000	And we've been tasked with this responsibility and it's a big one. We keep the world moving.
2785000	2790000	What was your question?
2790000	2793000	I'm at Leon. I'm at Leon Simpson.
2793000	2795000	Yeah, that's right. Leon's a cool guy.
2795000	2799000	Maggie, we've been dealing with some stuff for the last five days or so.
2799000	2804000	And it sounds like the crazy knowledge, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2804000	2808000	You were just spouting out at me and you were not there.
2808000	2811000	I couldn't be there, Clark, but I knew that you guys could handle it.
2811000	2815000	We couldn't, Maggie. We couldn't handle it.
2815000	2816000	Well, where are we at?
2816000	2820000	I just want to know why you weren't around.
2820000	2827000	Clark, does the ant question when it is being moved by a boot?
2827000	2831000	The things that you have been dealing with, they may seem large.
2831000	2836000	I guarantee you, you haven't seen anything yet.
2836000	2842000	After driving about 10 miles past the city, you take the country road that leads out to the mill.
2842000	2849000	Trees on either side of the road have grown to meet above, making a verdant tunnel that encases you.
2849000	2856000	A few miles down this road you see a small sign next to a gravel path that leads into the thick woods.
2856000	2861000	The sign says, the mill, on our grind and crushing it.
2861000	2868000	That gravel path leads to an opening where just enough trees have been removed to open up space for a parking lot
2868000	2876000	and a massive brick building with two enormous smokestacks reaching up into the canopy of trees encircling this property.
2876000	2878000	It makes you feel small.
2878000	2881000	The trees must be at least 12 stories tall.
2881000	2884000	And you pull into the mill.
2884000	2886000	Oh, shit.
2886000	2892000	And you guys park and she walks you into the mill and you go through a couple doors, corridors.
2892000	2897000	There's people all over the place working. They're not paying any attention to you whatsoever.
2897000	2899000	Even though I'm stylin'.
2899000	2901000	Even though you look...
2901000	2905000	Oh, you are such a wreck!
2905000	2907000	Do you still have this bag of ice?
2907000	2908000	Yeah, totally.
2908000	2910000	You're just carrying it with you.
2910000	2913000	As far as I'm concerned, that's my heart in that bag. I'm not gonna let it out of my sight.
2913000	2915000	Yeah, absolutely. That makes sense.
2915000	2923000	So even though you look like a fucking lunatic, no one pays you any mind as you follow Maggie Cook.
2923000	2927000	Real fast, has Clark ever been to the mill in his life?
2927000	2928000	No.
2928000	2930000	Other than what's happened in the last few days?
2930000	2934000	And then also, do I recognize anybody in the halls? Is there any familiar faces?
2934000	2936000	You recognize no one in the halls.
2936000	2942000	As you're going through these halls, you go through doorway after doorway that leads you to stairs and then other stairs.
2942000	2946000	And then finally, this one corridor of stairs that's blocked off.
2946000	2952000	She walks up to it and there's a scanner on one side of the door and she clicks a button.
2952000	2957000	And this little thing pops up and she sticks her armpit over it.
2957000	2961000	And then it beeps and it goes back into the wall and the door opens.
2961000	2963000	And you guys walk down these stairs.
2963000	2969000	Did that take your temperature, Maggie? Is that what that was? That's how you take a kid's temperature.
2969000	2973000	Oh yeah, no. You get into all these doors with your pubic hair.
2979000	2982000	Oh, of course. That makes sense. That's how you do it.
2982000	2992000	So you walk down and at this point, when the door opens, everything on the other side is completely different building structure than what you've been walking through before.
2992000	3000000	Everything past here is cold stone and it is a spiral staircase that leads down, down, down.
3000000	3006000	And it is quite dark, but you are led by a flickering light that is coming from the bottom.
3006000	3012000	And when you make it down to the bottom of the stairs, you are standing in a room that you have been in before.
3012000	3019000	And it is this circular domed room that is concrete all the way through.
3019000	3026000	And these familiar slabs are set up where there's one in the middle and there's six surrounding it.
3026000	3031000	As you walk in there, there are already two bodies on each slab.
3031000	3048000	And attached to each of these bodies is a xenonema toad, which is one of those crazy looking, just like this oily, squamous material that is actually this creature that you've seen the mouth of before.
3048000	3051000	And you've seen the razor sharp teeth with the teeth inside of it.
3051000	3055000	How are they attached to the bodies? Everybody has a different place?
3055000	3063000	Everybody has it in a different place and all of these people, they are covered in open sores from other placements.
3063000	3072000	And their skin is rotting and gross looking. Are any of them conscious? No one is conscious. Everyone's eyes are closed.
3072000	3075000	Maggie walks you into this room.
3076000	3081000	Alright, Clark. Well, this is the fun part.
3081000	3087000	To get inducted into the circle of knowledge, I'm going to need you to have a quick lie down on this table here.
3087000	3092000	And she points to the slab in the middle of the circle.
3092000	3098000	Whoa. Leon said he wasn't going to make me have to put one of those things. He said I didn't have to sacrifice flesh or limb.
3098000	3104000	Well, you're not going to have to sacrifice limb and you're only going to have to sacrifice a little flesh.
3104000	3108000	But the game has changed, Clark. And you're being inducted.
3108000	3112000	Real fast, does Clark, can Clark do a comparison between now and the last time he was here?
3112000	3115000	Is it the same number of people roughly in the room? Is it more or less?
3115000	3119000	I think it's the same number. I could be wrong. I think it's the exact same number.
3119000	3125000	The only difference is that the other two people, Leon Simpson and the woman who was here last time,
3125000	3131000	neither one of them are in this room. Leon! Leon! I sent them out.
3131000	3135000	Leon said I wasn't going to have to do this. Those things freak me out, Maggie.
3135000	3142000	She grabs your shoulders. Clark, faith through knowledge is just called knowledge.
3142000	3147000	I don't need you to have faith. I need you to have knowledge.
3147000	3153000	And she slowly kind of pushes your chest. I let it happen.
3153000	3160000	And then she moves down to your left foot. You haven't gotten shoes or socks yet, so she doesn't have to take off anything.
3160000	3168000	And she walks over to the side of the slab and there's this handle in the ground.
3168000	3180000	And she reaches down and she twists this circular handle, pulls up this big cartridge the size of a...what the fuck?
3180000	3186000	A parking pylon. Is it that big? Yep. Yep. A parking pylon.
3186000	3197000	Inside you see one of these creatures. And she, in one swift motion, pulls out the xenonimatode and attaches it to the bottom of your left foot.
3197000	3203000	And you feel it bite in and your vision immediately goes dark.
3203000	3211000	Ooh, boy. What's about to fucking happen?
3211000	3220000	The ground you're standing on is made of light. It is a soft glow that illuminates this new world from below.
3220000	3233000	You feel strange, content, satiated in every physical way. It is extremely relaxing, but also weirdly involuntary.
3233000	3243000	Above you is only darkness. In every direction surrounding you, where what could be called the sky meets what could be called the ground,
3243000	3253000	is blacker than black opaque darkness, except for the 12 figures in the distance and the giant black mass.
3253000	3262000	They are all dimly lit from below. You would think they would cast a shadow on the sky above if it was anything more than all-consuming darkness.
3262000	3269000	These 12 figures seem to be following some massive being as they travel away from you.
3269000	3278000	As you move closer, you hear the chanting. It's soft at first and muffled, but these 12 figures are chanting from deep in their lungs.
3278000	3287000	And ahead of them, seemingly made from the darkness that surrounds everything in this place, is a towering, lumbering beast.
3287000	3296000	It walks on two massive legs the size of trees. Its broad shoulders are at least 25 feet from the ground.
3296000	3304000	As you stare, its image seems to form and reform over and over like incomprehensible little glitches.
3304000	3312000	And then it roars. Every muscle in your body tenses up at the same time. All air leaves your lungs.
3312000	3319000	And you begin weeping uncontrollably before you can even hit the ground.
3326000	3337000	Your eyes open and you come to and you are laying on this table. Maggie Cook is putting this horrible creature back into the ground next to you.
3337000	3340000	And she looks up at you and she says,
3340000	3343000	Clark, that thing's coming.
3343000	3345000	And we keep it from coming here.
3345000	3349000	What was that, Maggie? What was it?
3349000	3350000	I need you to roll sanity.
3350000	3355000	The chanting, was it discernible? Was it words? Okay.
3355000	3356000	Would you have me roll sanity?
3356000	3357000	Yes, sir.
3357000	3360000	Fail. It's a 37 on a 23.
3360000	3369000	Oof. Okay. So I'm going to have you half a D6 again for that pretty horrifying and astounding situation that you've just been through.
3369000	3370000	Half a 3.
3370000	3371000	Alright.
3371000	3372000	Make it a 2.
3372000	3373000	Yes, sir. How many did you have?
3373000	3374000	I had 23.
3374000	3377000	Alright. Down to 21. What's your breaking point?
3377000	3378000	18.
3378000	3380000	And you didn't roll above your power, did you?
3380000	3381000	No.
3381000	3386000	I got a 60 power. I'll be alright for a while, I think.
3386000	3390000	I say that it's just a matter of a single roll that makes it not...
3390000	3394000	Yeah, it's a 40% chance that you freaked out on somebody.
3394000	3399000	Oh my God, if that had just happened just now, Al, that actually would have been cool.
3399000	3401000	That would have been tight.
3401000	3409000	I'm going to do it anyway. I punch a pumpkin.
3409000	3414000	Maggie, is there anything you can do about this? And I hold up the bag with my heart in it.
3414000	3419000	She reaches and grabs the rod and she pulls it out of the bag.
3419000	3420000	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
3420000	3423000	If you're Clark, trust me here, you're alive without it. Let me look at it.
3423000	3424000	Okay.
3424000	3429000	She grabs the rod. She pulls slowly. She goes, I know, I know.
3429000	3438000	She lifts it up and then she grabs your heart with one hand and she removes it from the rod like a shish kebab.
3438000	3441000	And it starts sputtering blood.
3441000	3442000	Oh, Maggie, Maggie.
3442000	3443000	And it's going all over the place.
3443000	3447000	I'm trying to get my hand over her hand to stop that sputtering.
3447000	3452000	And it's sputtering through your fingers like you've plugged a hose or something.
3452000	3454000	Do I have any physical sensation when doing that?
3454000	3455000	None at all.
3455000	3456000	Okay, cool.
3456000	3459000	None at all. She goes, you're fine. You're fine. Look at you. You're staying. You're fine. Alright?
3459000	3461000	Now, I want you to see something.
3461000	3468000	She grabs a small stick from a box in the corner of the room.
3468000	3476000	She comes back and she slowly puts it into the hollow metal rod and she begins pushing it all the way through.
3476000	3483000	And then she cups her hand at the end of the other side and through pops two little pieces of metal.
3484000	3489000	You remember our backup plan for if you didn't come back and finish your last job?
3489000	3492000	You didn't come back in time.
3492000	3493000	Oh.
3493000	3497000	I've tried to take your heart already, Clark. I think you're going to be fine.
3497000	3502000	I don't have a heart, Maggie. What?
3502000	3507000	Clark, a lot of things in this world move a lot stranger than we thought they might have.
3507000	3512000	Yeah. I mean, yeah. I'm seeing that now. That's for sure.
3512000	3518000	Clark, you're one of us now. And I hate to do this to you right away, but I've got a job for you.
3518000	3522000	You asked where Leon was. He's on a job. I'm going to send you out on one as well.
3522000	3525000	What does that mean, Maggie?
3525000	3531000	I have a lot of responsibility, Clark. I have my eyes on a lot of pies. Alright?
3531000	3538000	I send you out. You complete the job. You come back. Most of the time, that's all you need to know. Okay?
3538000	3542000	Now, I got kind of a rough one for you right off the top.
3542000	3548000	But where it's taking place, you are already supposed to be.
3548000	3554000	I need you to go to the funeral today. It starts in, she holds up her watch, starts in an hour.
3554000	3562000	It's at the city cemetery. I heard about, you know, Ari dying in the fire.
3562000	3569000	I was pretty shook up about that. But this does give us quite the opportunity.
3569000	3576000	You see her dad, Stan Manstein, he's going to be out of the city asylum for the first time in a long time.
3576000	3585000	He doesn't go out much. And we need to take this opportunity. Clark, I need you to take him out.
3585000	3593000	You want me to kill Ari's dad at Ari's fucking funeral?
3593000	3598000	It's actually more of an assassination attempt, but yeah.
3598000	3607000	Okay. Okay, Maggie. That thing I just saw in that vision, whatever the fuck it was,
3607000	3611000	scares me more than anything that I've ever experienced in my life before.
3611000	3619000	If you're telling me, if you're telling me killing Ari's dad is going to stop that thing, fuck it. Sure.
3619000	3621000	Hand me a gun.
3641000	3643000	How are you doing?
