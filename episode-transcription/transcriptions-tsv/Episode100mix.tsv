0	6280	What's good my spawn? It's your mom Wolf the dog, and I am here to provide
6840	11400	Sustenance in the form of a radio show. Will it nurture your organs?
12520	19800	Maybe. Will it feed your brain? It better. Will it deliver you all unto the great void?
20680	22680	I actually do not know
22680	24680	I
29320	31480	Hello one hello all
32160	37000	Hello, y'all. It's your best friend with the trash-eating problem wolf the dog
37000	41160	It is December 6th, and the time is five o'clock y'all
41800	45620	Sounds like it's about garbage been o'clock for your wolfy boy
45620	49580	Now speaking of trash earlier
49580	55760	I took my dog wolf the dog to go find him something to fill his big old belly up with
55980	62980	But upon venturing outside the sky suddenly darkened all around us for a little bit y'all ever seen an eclipse
63180	65180	it was like that but uh
65820	71240	Different it was real spooky y'all wolf nearly shit his big-ass britches
71360	77320	Which wolf did that I'll let y'all figure that one out when I came back down to the studio
77320	81520	I found a note attached with a thumb tacked to the inside of my door
81560	86880	It is emblazoned with a solid green triangle and says for wolf at the top
86880	93800	I guess it's this week's howlin with wolf it comes from user chuckling boy over on the subreddit
93800	95040	He's an Android user
95040	102200	But logged on to iTunes on his computer to leave a review this boy sure knows how to make old wolfy blush
102760	108260	Chuckling boy writes the cowboy years introduced a turn of phrase for dealing with a shitstorm
108600	113760	We called it a night at the Opera you boys have taken care of a few off-screen
113760	117740	But damned if your debut isn't like the Mets own debut Faust
118480	123900	Somewhat fitting isn't that and remember the mission is over when the world ends
124140	128620	For all of you out there listening be sure to stop by the subreddit
128620	136000	We are starting to see more discussion around the greater Delta green cannon as well as game running tips and general show
136000	138000	stuff see y'all there
138260	140340	Wolf bless you chuckling boy
140340	146140	I think you're smooth like butter like a criminal undercover hot like summer
146380	151420	y'all make me sweat like that when you tag us on Instagram or Twitter at
151900	157080	Pretending pod all right a five-star review on Apple podcast that's good, too
157420	162500	Fuck a whole lot of people, but especially those with influence who propagate
163180	168660	Anti-science rhetoric it's time for the news a tall gaunt
169220	171220	humanoid figure
174140	177620	Where an older version of himself just stood
178260	182780	None of that made a lick of sense to me, but that doesn't mean I'm not hungry
183660	188100	Filling me up always is kudzu with no backbone
207620	209620	You
217100	221020	All see yourselves existing in this infinite
221620	229420	Darkness and you feel eyes on you all over you and out of your own bodies floating in this vast
230060	232060	nothingness in this endless void
232620	234420	You see a hand
234420	241780	stretching out of darkness and in the palm of this hand a small metal sphere a ball
242380	247300	Suddenly long and wiry metal tendrils begin shooting from this round
247660	255100	Shape the wires wrap their way around this hand holding the silver object and begin tightening the grasp
256100	261140	Constricting until the skin on this hand peels open at each strip of wire
261760	264860	Bleeding out into the nothing and this hand
265460	268860	unable to hold the ball any longer falls and
269580	275780	disappears and with no platform no support the silver sphere to begins falling a
276220	279780	line of bodies forms in its downward
280260	287060	Trajectory hoping to slow its descent the bodies are human men women children and their fashion
287420	295220	Follows a distinct pattern the first bodies are dressed like pioneers in the Old West you recognize one as
295500	297540	the founder of contentions wife
298020	299340	Mary Cole
299340	307020	the next looks to be from the turn of the century then the roaring 20s the Great Depression then looks from the
307220	311060	Mid-century and eventually you see modern clothing as you know
311060	315980	It far down at the end of this line and this small metal sphere this ball
316380	321300	Cannot be held for long on top of each of these bodies before its wire arms
321520	325900	Decimate the skin until there's no more blood left to drain from this
326220	332020	Biological shell or the round object simply blasts its way through its short-lived host
332660	336740	Either way the blood from previous bodies above
337460	339460	trickles at the start
339700	347240	Eventually pouring down onto those below before the subject of this story even makes it to them and finally
347700	349700	the lowest body a
350080	351980	young girl
351980	354660	Receives this hellish gift
355540	363460	The ball buries itself into her forehead and the vast nothingness is blown away by a new
363580	367380	Setting this girl is running through the woods. It's raining
367380	369740	She seems to be chasing a teenage boy
369740	377240	The girl lifts a machete that flickers in the glint of the moonlight and the boy turns around just in time to watch as
377240	379240	She brings the sharp blade down
379540	381540	over her head
381540	382900	But
382900	389540	She trips and she drops the machete which plunges perfectly into a crack between two stones
389640	393460	Blade facing up and this young girl falls face first
394060	396060	splitting open her skull
396300	400380	revealing a small metal sphere sitting inside
401220	408140	The scene changes again and the only image that remains is the cleft head of this young girl
408300	413940	Now sitting in a storage tub atop a folded bloody suit
413940	419560	But time has not treated this head. Well, it has been removed from her body
420380	422380	the skin decayed and
423420	426460	slumping over the bones in her face completely
428060	435100	Unrecognizable and we see John Lee Pettymore the fourth who's plucked the silver ball out of this corpses dome
435540	437540	And he pops it in his pocket
438260	440420	And your vision fills with water
441140	449080	Sitting on top of all this water is a desk and sitting on top of this desk is the small metal sphere as well
449080	456380	As an odd-looking old-timey revolver with glass tubes on the cylinder and a green light lit in front of the desk
457260	461800	Rosemary dives for the gun and snatches it behind the desk
462020	466520	Marvin Glass reaches out one of his spindly arms and with the flick of his
467040	470140	Translucent hand he flings the ball at her
470640	477060	Suddenly multiple shiny limbs extend from the small metal sphere and slam into the body of its target
478060	484000	Rosemary one of its appendages slices into the soft tissue on the back of Rosemary's neck
484120	490200	Another snaps her head forward and you hear the fracture as a third metal tendril reaches in
490560	496000	Gripping the top of Rosemary's spine where it meets her head and it rips her entire
496400	502560	Spinal cord out of her body in one swift motion promptly forcing itself into the now
502980	505940	vacant spinal column of this human being
506800	514660	The new Rosemary standing before you has a crazed look in her eyes as she blows her nose
515560	517160	into her hand
517160	520440	Slams the mucus black shiny
521240	528040	Fiscus into the empty chamber and squeezes the trigger on this odd-looking revolver
528600	535640	There's an almost blinding flash of light that illuminates your entire field of vision and then
536120	540400	Covering the spot where Rosemary just stood this black
541040	542360	shiny
542360	544360	Fiscus sludge
545360	547080	Oozes and
547080	553560	Seemingly inside this muck is the placid body of Rosemary
554400	557160	she is lying peacefully as
558240	561840	Her limbs seem to fold into this ooze
562960	567640	becoming one with the sentient mass of goop and
568480	570200	then
570200	571880	You all
571880	573880	Wake up
574360	581040	You've felt this feeling before the shock your stomach feels weird and content your ears are
582000	584120	Ringing it's dark. It's cold
585160	592640	And it smells like burned flesh which immediately brings you back as your eyes begin to adjust
593880	599560	there's a pool of blood on the floor and next to it is a coffin on the ground an
600200	604480	Ari Manstein's mausoleum where you've woken up before you look at each other
604520	610480	there's blood splatter speckled on each of you John Lee Kevin Lee Pettymore the thirth and
611240	619200	All-black tactical gear Keith Vigna in his brightly colored polo and boat shoes Clark Bishop and an old
619640	623520	contention PD uniform currently holding a thick
624080	627920	Black cloak and the shock begins to wear off
628760	634280	You feel the searing pain on your chest on your back
634800	636960	on the bottom of your left foot and
637520	640040	inside your dominant palm
642320	648160	Welcome back to contingent boys or rather the city cemetery
649360	651360	Holy shit
652000	654000	I'm getting sick of this shit
654880	656880	Uh
657720	665160	Clark is looking bewildered at everybody. Are we back? What's the last thing you guys remember?
666600	668600	John and I know we
670360	673640	We found we found my parents old book you
674640	681400	Where it was right under my nose the whole time. Is it it's in my house. Well, what's in it? I
682400	684400	Mean I
686480	688480	Power I guess
690080	692080	It lets you it lets you do things it's
692720	695680	What's what's your last memory Keith? What happened when you?
696280	700040	Crossed through the door. Oh my god. I I have vivid
700840	702840	vivid memory of
703200	705200	falling through the door
705280	707740	landed on the pastor I went
708340	713260	through some of those doors down there and went down an elevator and I
715140	717540	Got to our room doors in an elevator
718180	722860	Opened a few doors and what I got I got into a room and found
724100	726100	Well, I found
726820	735040	Some papers and I found the gun and I saw Tilly B, but she was
735040	737040	Very
737080	739080	Much worse for wear
739080	740560	how so
740560	743280	well, she just her hair was falling out and her
744000	748560	skin looked thin and almost translucent and just
749280	751800	she didn't have any fingernails and oh
752720	754720	man, I I
754760	756440	found a
756440	758080	spell on
758080	763920	One of those papers and I I said it and my my fingernails popped off
765080	772200	And I checked my hand real quick and you have fingernails. Thank God. Wait was was Tilly be alive. She was alive
772200	774200	She was acting like a monster
774240	775680	or
775680	777560	like a caged-up
777560	779480	animal she was
779480	785680	Behind a door like a blast door, but I didn't open it up. She was screaming and making crazy noises and
786680	788680	after I cast that first spell I
789560	791560	figured it worked and
791680	799380	Figured you know magic works. So I I cast this cast a spell that that Mildred Mitchell had on her and
800600	802600	my god my I
803240	805240	Feel I want to feel my arm
805640	807640	You can feel the metal
807800	811200	underneath where muscle should be when I cast that
812360	820040	My arm and chest and face ripped open and all the metal that was in me popped out and I pre grew my bones
821040	823040	They just popped back in
824120	829240	At that point I kind of lost it and I pulled the trigger on that gun and
832040	835040	Guys I was Silas Cole. I
836600	842320	I found it contention. I own them. I own the mine and I
845320	847920	I'm made I made Mary
847920	852740	Mary's a ball you made Mary Cole
854040	860120	Mary I think it gets real fuzzy after I pull that trigger, but I
861840	864040	Don't know if there is a Mary Cole
865040	869560	Mary is is ma are why she's a ball
870480	872480	She's one of those silver balls
873060	875920	Why did you what do you ma are? Why what I?
876680	878680	Well, I
879240	884500	It's fuzzy and it's not at the same time when before I pulled that trigger. I found paper
886000	888000	with the
888960	893840	It had a through X of what looked like failed attempts of making something and
895020	897020	the last one was
897320	901600	looked like a success and it was M a are why
901600	903600	Like
904320	910920	You ain't got no alibi you're Mary what what you're Mary I
912840	914840	Had to off the dog make that same
917680	920480	Really yep, damn it I
923680	929060	Made him do it. I made him. I made him make Justin
929940	933420	Every once in a while put in a joke that I'm like hi you motherfucker
934380	941880	Hey Luke, are you using your internet from your house or your hotspot my hotspot? Is it bad? Yeah, maybe use the other one
942020	947460	Okay, I will until your robot voicing hard which made that agonizing and wonderful
950780	952580	Okay
952580	955160	I'm on regular internet now, so
955920	961280	Fingers crossed it stays on so did you get most of that or should I go over it?
962000	964320	Just with you guys I got the gist of it
964320	966020	There was one thing that you cut out for that
966020	970240	I was here Oh your but did you say your your metal popped out and something about your bones?
970440	976040	My bones grew back grew back. Oh shit. I thought you said everything popped out
978180	980280	Metal and bones but your grunts, okay
980280	984960	It feels like I'm still got metal in me now, so there might be there might be a way back
987000	989000	Yeah, I mean to what we were
989600	995120	Yeah, I wouldn't I don't know if I'd recommend going through that again, but let me see that watch you son of a bitch
995560	1000320	Thankfully, he doesn't wake up with the watch you had to go get it in contention. Thank God
1003560	1006700	But yeah after I pull that trigger I have vague memories of
1007380	1010060	Starting the town and having the mine and
1010980	1013900	making stuff that helps people and you know
1014720	1021860	Wow, you didn't go all evil anything. Did you I don't know it just gets up to a certain point and then it's nothing
1021860	1027220	I can't remember probably not you probably just did good. How do you know how to make stuff? You know how to make stuff?
1027860	1033020	Now yeah, like I said, I've been secretly competent this whole time like I said the
1033540	1037600	Once I've pulled that trigger it all gets super fuzzy. I just
1038300	1042660	Make us all right now. It's almost like I wasn't doing it. It's like I have the memory of
1043740	1046420	Like somebody else, but I know it was me
1047100	1049140	Cuz I felt going back in time
1049140	1055340	I've felt it but are you sorry saying that you didn't have the capability to to change anything. I
1056020	1058940	Don't know what apparently not I've you know
1058940	1063500	I was feeling a little crazy when I pulled that trigger
1064380	1068860	Like if I had a meter of sanity, there was nothing else to lose in it
1070380	1076420	Almost as if my decisions were not my own but a higher beings. I know that feeling sure sure. Yeah
1081060	1085740	You're talking about the the gun with the tubes on it, is that what you're saying that was the one yeah
1086140	1089900	But at the same one, I don't know if it it's either the same one or
1090580	1097100	Or it's gotta be it's gotta be a replica. But I mean, I think that room I was in down there. It was some sort of like
1098420	1102420	Science lab for Silas Cole, which was me
1103140	1106940	But I didn't know it until I became Silas Cole
1107540	1115300	but then I must have remembered the diagrams and made them from what I remembered again and then
1115740	1117740	It's a made more of them
1119740	1123180	Is one of them dang old bootstrap paradoxes it sounds like
1125420	1127420	It does sound like that Keith
1129500	1131580	Shit I haven't gone by Keith in a while
1132420	1134100	That's weird
1134100	1136300	and he just looks off into the distance like
1137140	1138940	way deep in thought
1138940	1142340	So do you reckon that Adams Cain Adam Cain's?
1142340	1144340	I
1146900	1153420	Reckon Adams Cain got him through all this. Yeah, I was thinking Adams Cain like there's multiple of them and that's what you say
1155540	1157540	Like courts martial
1159580	1165060	You you reckon then that Adam Cain's whole plan would it would have been destined to fail if
1165560	1168360	He wouldn't have been able to change anything in the past. It sounds like
1169080	1172940	You guys think that that was a viable option maybe everything is
1174120	1176120	Predetermined I thought of
1176960	1182760	Science experiments and stuff not philosophy. So the gun is behind the door
1183280	1185800	that's right, and I think that watch opened it up because
1186440	1193360	Right when I got down there the other door open when my watch was close to it and I told you John and Adam Cain
1193360	1197840	Has the radio and the helmet right now? I guess he does
1197840	1201920	He's probably I bet he did that earlier than just right now
1202520	1206560	Seemed like by the time we got back there. He'd been consolidating all this shit for a few days
1206560	1209960	He really yeah made hay while we were away, you know
1209960	1215600	Once you time travel this much it's real hard just to determine where you are when you are
1215880	1222040	Speaking of and I look at my watch. What time is it in the mausoleum now 5 p.m. Yeah. Sorry
1222080	1226960	Do you want to guess 5 p.m. I bet it's about 5 p.m. Oh my god. Yep. That's it
1227040	1232320	So in the past we've woken up at 3 and 1 and 11. Yeah. Yeah as a number 4, baby
1232360	1234360	So it's 5 o'clock
1234400	1238200	What do you reckon? We're doing right now like not us but
1239080	1242940	Us God are there are there three other us is running around?
1243840	1250000	As we speak that's kind of been our operating theory so far. Yeah, maybe we're the ones who just let ball
1250000	1252240	Take care of everything. Look at your body. Look at your body
1252240	1256220	Do we have anything crossed out this time and I'm looking at all the yeah names
1256600	1263420	Before you had seen that Marvin on each of your chests were crossed out and you confirm that
1264340	1269240	You saw that Maggie on the bottom of your left feet were crossed out
1269400	1276360	Which you also confirm and Clark you again see the eaten away logo for the circle of knowledge
1277280	1280100	On your back was drew
1280780	1284680	Which you all see is crossed out when you check each other's backs
1285500	1290380	Check for ticks too and inside the dominant palm of each of your hands
1291220	1294580	It says Tildy and that is also
1295220	1298340	Crossed out. Oh shit. That last one was a twofer
1301060	1305300	Well, this this it kind of seems like we got a freebie boys to just tie this all up
1305300	1310340	Well, so Drew's crossed out what what ended up happening with Drew? Oh, yeah
1310340	1313260	You don't even know what happened after you went down in the hole. No
1314340	1318340	The pastor might yeah. Well, that's in the future past
1322480	1328760	Wait, what about the pastor's future past? Well, I left him down there with two bullet holes in his feet, but I propped him up
1331860	1333860	You kind of glossed over that
1334820	1338660	Remember you said to shoot him so he didn't follow me and I did and then you said
1340340	1341700	Literally, yeah
1341700	1346420	Yeah, was he ever he was he was still knocked out unconscious the last time you saw him
1346420	1353460	Yeah, and I reckon if I went back in time and all that probably nobody else got there that got down there to him. So
1354820	1356820	oops
1357020	1359020	But yeah withdrew what happened withdrew
1359300	1365640	What happened what happened with everything after I went down there when when's last you saw drew was he still under gunpoint?
1366020	1367740	well, he was
1367740	1369380	drew
1369380	1372700	Carries or what? However, we're saying he was good
1372700	1379140	I'm the last thing I remember pretty much was him in her body and not really much else had happened
1380220	1385980	Well, I took a shot at Adam as you guys were heading down into that hole and that prompted
1386980	1390420	Kristoff fuck. What was his name? Yeah, the janitor. Yeah
1391420	1395600	We thought we thought drew was a goner because we heard a gunshot ring out right then
1396220	1403980	Turned out we had a little Savior in the in our midst. Yeah, who shot Kristoff's hand off. It was a
1405260	1409060	Her name's and loved you. Do you know her? No
1409060	1410980	She
1410980	1415740	Killed my parents. She killed your parents and love killed my parents
1416620	1423220	To have you always known that or I mean, I've known it as much as I've known things since these things started. Oh
1424220	1429100	What she killed your parents? Why is she trying to get you and mister?
1429500	1435700	Here's the thing is that and I've known this for a while and that's been eating me up. She she works for the circle
1435700	1437700	She's a circle of knowledge member
1438020	1443500	She was also in case L with Kevin with dad you and
1447420	1453340	Daddy me. Yeah. Well, what was she doing there? Well, I thought she was working for the circle here
1453340	1458540	Here's the mind blower. You ready for this get you might sit down. Are you seated? Well, you know it can't yeah
1458580	1464100	sure, Jim Cook was her handler in some kind of covert operation to
1465060	1467060	Do stuff
1467420	1469420	Secret
1470860	1472860	Interest can you believe that?
1482220	1484220	You know what Keith
1485140	1487140	Thanks, something's up
1487300	1489700	Got a firm grasp on how all this works
1491580	1493740	Jim was her hands. So you're telling me
1494740	1498340	Jim cook was an loves handler to do something secret
1498380	1506060	So they were he was the handler of case L it turned out but then he had some kind of some kind of a splintering
1506420	1512100	So you remember we saw those notes about how Maggie heard that Jim Cook was worried about Maggie and all that
1512100	1516620	there was some kind of yeah some kind of strife within the circle itself and
1517540	1518540	And
1518540	1523980	Was was working for Jim in particular. So that's why she killed my parents Jim sent her off to get a book
1524580	1530940	You remember that book we found in Jim's house. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, that's one. He like homemade so it didn't work too. Well
1531780	1535840	Okay, so you got the real book at your house turns out
1536460	1539300	John can actually fill you in on how we figure that now. I
1539940	1541940	Had a vision. Oh
1542180	1547880	Without the watch yes, but that though that's my own thing god damn it. Oh, okay. I believe you
1547900	1549900	Everybody's doing their part to save the world
1552860	1554860	I was Silas Cole guy
1559620	1562660	Tell me what happened what about it? What about the book?
1562900	1566340	It's a grimoire and wanted us to get it real bad
1566340	1569100	And then we were gonna go over to calm comfy campground
1569100	1572340	But then she did some shit that we didn't take too kindly to
1573060	1575060	namely killing John I
1575260	1577820	Thought John she killed you well nearly
1578660	1584940	Stabbed a knife through his head good ass. I got I got pretty lucky though without provocation or I
1586180	1588180	wouldn't exactly say
1590180	1592180	Without provocation, but
1592300	1597220	while we were talking to Ann John let it slip that he was a ball and
1598100	1604500	Turns out that's kind of Ann's whole thing is to get rid of them balls. She's trying to get rid of all my kind
1605140	1608100	okay, so that makes a little more sense why I should do that, so
1609100	1614340	Did you guys save drew though? Oh, yeah, I forgot. That's what you asked about. He's fine. He went back to the tunnels
1614340	1621220	We told him to you said get on down there just scamper be safe, and then did you kill Ann yeah, I?
1622060	1624060	Got real mad at her and I killed her
1624220	1628820	And then I still was kind of curious about what the book would do now that we knew where it was cuz she was so
1628820	1630820	Hyped up on it right
1630860	1632860	went and got the book and
1635140	1637140	That's I
1637540	1639540	Yeah, they kill you
1640500	1647600	Use it no not it. It certainly didn't kill me in fact. It. Maybe did the opposite, but I it all gets fuzzy after that
1648220	1650220	huh, huh
1650880	1652880	What happened with your head wound oh
1653660	1654940	well
1654940	1656940	And magic some of it away
1657660	1659780	enough for me to help out and killing her I
1660540	1667140	Also, I gave a I gave a shot at doing the same thing. I'd just seen an do which was
1667860	1669820	Just a little just a little blood magic
1669820	1674260	She just did like a like a little magic spell with that used that used blood
1674700	1679540	like like John said that a while ago would have really freaked me out, but
1680260	1681220	It freaked me out, too
1681220	1686860	I tell you what I believe in magic it freaked me out so much that I decided to try it myself in a young girl's
1686860	1688060	heart
1688060	1690060	You believe in magic
1690580	1696140	It worked when I did it well, and what did it do held him up held him up a whole lot if I remember right?
1696940	1699380	Sorry, that's I don't know yeah, it felt real nice
1700140	1705140	So I was really filled with purpose at that point and decided to go and get the book and that's the last thing I remember
1706060	1708060	It yeah
1708300	1710700	You got I got it. I got to
1712060	1713620	you
1713620	1716260	Keith you can relate you know sometimes at the end of the day
1716980	1721620	You're crazy, and I didn't really know what I was nothing left in you yeah
1724180	1725740	You guys remember
1725740	1733340	Jim cook right remember Jim when we found out he died in a yeah in an alley right I did that
1734340	1737660	You did you did that I did that when
1738980	1743060	what I touched the book and I said a spell and I
1744420	1746300	Was suddenly in the alley with Jim
1746300	1752540	and I knew that he'd sent and loved to kill my parents and it it just got the better of me and I I
1754260	1756260	Killed him I strangled him and I killed him oh
1757500	1759820	Whoa whoa whoa whoa Clark Clark?
1761260	1763260	You're under arrest
1764340	1766340	I'm just kidding
1770860	1778480	So is that the last thing you remember is killing him in all honesty. Yeah that I got the feeling that
1779540	1785220	I'd found purpose in my life, but when did that happen that was just a couple days ago
1786660	1788860	That was five days ago five days ago
1789740	1791740	So we potentially could have
1792820	1798260	Have a few of you running around along with us a murdering one
1798260	1800980	You know the last thing I remember is watching wheel of fortune
1805460	1813180	Well boys with the fell asleep on the couch and woke up here really damn yeah, you get me right
1813180	1820020	Roll intelligence fucking one
1822820	1830020	Keith I swear to God I got him all right every one of them. Well damn what a worthless fucking one
1830020	1832020	I
1838380	1844220	Don't know what the hell we do now. I mean going to watch wheel of fortune sounds just good as anything
1844220	1847500	Hey, I John Lee petty more roll a d10 for me
1848860	1852180	Seven gain seven sanity nice I
1853060	1859540	Can't tell what's real in this world, but wheel of fortune. That's it. There is something so calming about that experience
1860060	1864140	after everything that you've been through of just sitting on the couch and
1865020	1870740	Crushing wheel of fortune boys. I'd highly recommend it. I'm right there with you. I wish I could it I
1872260	1874980	Mean what do you what what do we do now?
1874980	1881580	I mean, I've got a couple couple ideas personally it kind of depends. Oh, that's one thing Keith
1881580	1887580	I should tell you and love put a name to that creature that I saw she called it a gigantic
1888100	1894020	Permanente kiss I nailed it. Don't ask me more and she clarified and she
1896540	1901780	She she she said that that that whole thing's real that whole thing is something that the circle is is
1901980	1904300	Trying to keep out of the world Freeman Donna
1904980	1906980	That's it
1908780	1912260	That's right, that's what she said right John. Yeah, no something like that
1912980	1916980	Real hold up real quick. I gotta I gotta rewrite the end of this campaign real quick
1918580	1920580	Yeah
1921780	1924980	Yeah, so and and was telling us that the the giant
1926140	1927180	Penta kid
1927180	1933420	Perminta kiss was a was a real bad thing and that was still the goal of the circle and that's always kind of been
1933420	1941060	The thing here's here's one kind of scary thing Keith that and mentioned to us is that Maggie had some designs on the circle of knowledge
1941060	1943060	That would then
1943140	1946060	Lay in a new world order or something like that
1946380	1950460	But Ann was pretty much on our side as far as she didn't care about that
1950460	1953400	She just wanted to make sure that the creature didn't happen
1954100	1959460	Well, the is the creature related to the ball in any way, you know hell
1959460	1964020	I haven't been able to make that connection quite if I made ball then probably not
1965140	1969720	Probably not where you may. Yeah, I made ball. I
1970580	1972580	made Mary
1973140	1975140	Daddy
1976420	1981500	I'm you're my real daddy. I guess so. Holy shit
1989540	1991540	Runs out of the mausoleum
1991660	1994200	and he stumbles over one of the
1994900	1998980	broken androids who's crushed and falling on the ground and
1999860	2004920	Sitting in this dirt and this cold cold December 6th. You're looking up
2004920	2009340	The fire is almost completely out on this crawfish boil
2010340	2011780	smell
2011780	2013780	souring hits your nose
2013820	2018840	As he runs out I look at Clark and kind of like give him an elbow and go
2019380	2022540	Hey son, where are you going and then laugh to myself?
2022540	2024540	We
2026300	2028300	Probably ought to follow him out though
2028460	2033860	I'd be careful about person this one Keith. That's that's why I said it in here
2036620	2039460	Yeah, I'll start following John out just to make sure
2039980	2045380	John John don't don't get too far. We get it. We got to figure something out now. John is running
2045380	2047380	He's gonna disappear if you don't catch him
2047380	2049380	So
2050540	2053700	You just take off I look at Clark I
2054500	2056340	guess
2056340	2059780	John and I just take off after him. Oh, hey. Oh hell
2060820	2062820	Clark's gonna run to
2063220	2066260	John John come back. We're gonna need your help
2068300	2070300	Okay, yeah
2070860	2076100	For the last time you just run right by those androids don't look at them at all Clark take your headphones off
2077380	2079380	Take your headphones off as well
2081300	2084360	Joe not Clark, whatever you have one name
2091740	2093800	Thomas dr. Bradley aim
2103700	2105700	Say it
2106300	2108300	Dr. Bradley anus
2112180	2114700	We got to name ourselves in the zoom chat
2116980	2120180	Tell me petty more the third is sprinting through
2121100	2124860	Mausoleum, I need you to roll an alertness check for me
2126980	2128260	17
2128260	2133260	There are clearly the lights and sounds of an ambulance
2133820	2138700	Pulled up at the entrance of the city cemetery, which is now
2139500	2143540	Close enough that you can tell what is happening up there
2144460	2147040	Remembering back from the last time that you were here
2147300	2154220	There's a woman sitting in a wheelchair at the entrance the city cemetery who passed away
2154980	2156980	likely an hour ago
2156980	2160700	That's probably what this is. I I crossed myself and
2161700	2163700	Pay my respects to
2166540	2171300	You know this woman who we have really come to think of as a friend
2174980	2177180	And then I'm booking it for the
2178900	2183180	Marmal glasses place. Okay. I'm looking at for planet juggernaut fair enough
2183180	2185180	As
2187020	2190660	Clark Bishop and Keith vigna take off running through these above-ground
2191340	2196780	Mausoleums here in the city cemetery. I need you to roll alertness checks for me
2198220	2204900	61 on a 60. Oh shit. I thought I'd rolled a 11, but it's a 17 on a 70
2205900	2207900	Thank God
2208940	2212940	Sometimes is a handler you really really want
2214700	2216700	Certain roles to get made. Oh
2218460	2220460	That was nerve-wracking
2220500	2223700	as you're running through you hear sirens and
2224220	2226780	You see lights from an ambulance
2227700	2230180	at the entrance the semi-se
2230860	2232540	Semi-semitary
2232540	2234540	the semi-semitary
2234580	2240020	The semester and as soon as you recognize that you actually hear
2240900	2247540	The running of a slightly heavier than human man taking off in a perpendicular
2248220	2255740	Direction to the entrance of the city cemetery and that man is running toward the glass compound
2256580	2261500	Is a John do we know it's John we would have just been running after him. Yeah. Yeah, it's John, okay
2261500	2266300	I wasn't sure if it was one of the robot guys that were protecting Stan Manstein got back up
2266300	2269460	That's what I was. No, you didn't hear me make fun of you for not looking at them. I
2271540	2274580	Mean I just remembered them I brought him up every time
2278620	2284660	Well, so since I filled my alertness check I'm gonna keep running till till he alerts me
2285860	2288340	Keith he's heading that way. There's a there's there's a there's a
2289020	2293540	Ambulance up there at the front gate. He's good. He's going the other way. He's heading toward the glass compound. Let's
2294300	2296300	Go get him
2298100	2300460	Silas Cole completely forgot what Keith Vigna's
2304180	2309180	Yeah, I'm like, um, it's legitimately weird for me to be Keith again
2309820	2311820	Right now. Yeah, I
2312100	2314100	am in pursuit of
2314780	2316500	John I
2316500	2323140	Am too do I see him? Can I see him? Am I that close roll both of you real athletics for me? I
2324220	2326220	Got an 8 on a 50
2326380	2331460	Fuck I got a 31 on the baseline 30. I was super fucking close. Wow
2332460	2334460	Let's get Thomas in here to roll for us
2344100	2346100	It was a bit
2346940	2348940	It seemed like a bit
2349260	2350980	What's up?
2350980	2354580	We were waving at you looked up and then just look down at your phone
2356420	2363860	Like right when we started burning it right when we started doing it. Hey Thomas real quick roll athletics for me. Oh
2366980	2369620	Nope 70 on a 50 so as you're
2370420	2376580	Approaching the edge of the city cemetery about to make your way onto a
2377100	2379740	Main street here in the city
2380380	2387940	Keith Vigna catches up to you and you can see Clark Bishop trailing at least eight mausoleums behind
2389300	2395940	Standard measurement when I catch up I want to just like grab his shoulder like what are you doing? Just come on slow down
2395940	2400940	We got a we got a talk. Where are you going? It's far away from you as I can get
2400940	2407900	I never asked to be born. Don't worry about that right now. I'm not even totally sure what any of it means. Oh
2408700	2412700	Great real comforting dad, please. Don't call me that
2414220	2416220	Dad
2417220	2419420	Clark Bishop hears as he approaches
2420980	2425240	Where are you running off to I'm going to be with planet juggernaut John
2425940	2430220	I'm gonna ride him into the sky. No, it's what I want to do
2432820	2439020	John just just cuz there's a chance that Keith in the body of Silas Cole invented you doesn't mean he's your dad
2439380	2441860	You had a dad. It was Kevin. You're in his body now
2441860	2443860	Oh
2455420	2457420	Full identity crisis
2462740	2469860	Well, he wasn't here to raise me when I was a young one and neither were you Keith so planet juggernaut is the strongest male
2469900	2475040	Influence I've ever had in my life. You're older than me. I don't know how I could have raised you
2475740	2477740	Then what you should have thought of that
2478180	2480180	Before you had me
2481620	2482940	Well
2482940	2484940	Shit, I'm out of breath
2485660	2493460	Actually, uh, John Lee Pettymore cannon is 26 years old and Keith Vigna is 29 years old
2494380	2498560	We never talked about birthdays. Yeah, John never asked Keith
2500380	2501660	a
2501660	2503660	John assumed the same
2507660	2512820	Clark help me talk some sense into him. We I don't even know where we need to be going John
2512820	2515980	I'll tell you I don't I don't think the glass compounds where we need to go
2515980	2518980	First of all that his name is crossed off our chests
2518980	2524260	That seems like a clear sign that that's all taken care of over there at the end of the day
2524260	2528780	We're gonna need you with that vision thing you got going on these days. That's that's a powerful skill you got
2528780	2531540	That's something you can hang your hat on. That's all I am to you
2531540	2533300	I mean you've been you've been with us from the beginning
2533300	2536320	We didn't we never treated a different after we found out you were ball
2536980	2541820	You were still one of our friend. It's cuz we need you around you're you're you you help us
2543420	2545420	Y'all always did treat me like a friend
2546900	2549700	All right, what do you want to do Clark you got any
2550540	2553540	Yeah, any ideas? I got I got one
2553780	2559400	Yeah now that we know where the book is and these days I'm feeling like I have my wits about me a little more
2560420	2565220	Why don't we go get the book and head over to calm comfy campground? See what see what we can do?
2565420	2567420	Maybe save the world there
2568260	2575660	Okay, you know what that that one song said I'll follow you into the dark Clark
2575660	2577660	I
2580340	2584680	Don't step on Superman's cape I'm no Superman
2588460	2593060	You don't follow Clark into the dark and you don't mess around with Jim
2593060	2597780	I see you guys think that ambulance is here to pick up our mess back there. Oh, most certainly
2597780	2600420	Yeah, I think we ought to let him see that
2601020	2601940	Hey, all right
2602060	2605460	You know what a good place to start might be checking out the bodies of these androids
2606020	2608380	Moving them into the mausoleum, so they're not so obvious
2608860	2616660	Yeah, I don't think I don't think this to have an EMTs see robots. It's gonna be help our case any let's get on it
2616900	2620300	John they were at the front gate when we busted out of the mausoleum after you there
2620300	2625960	I think they're they're pretty close. We got a hurry. We got to move fast. So so we are dragging the
2626660	2629740	Androids back into the mausoleum, but also giving them a thorough
2630260	2637580	Investigation Zach as we do so especially their penises you guys are so good at role-playing. It's wild. Thanks
2638860	2641580	you know these ideas just come to us second I
2643380	2647620	Mean you did say every time we left the mausoleum that they were there so
2648980	2654460	It's not like we would have forgotten that yeah. Well was also just like yeah, we killed him
2657020	2659020	Dealt with what's next
2659820	2662160	There's nothing interesting about them. Fuck you
2665980	2667460	Okay, so
2667460	2673880	So the three of you make your way back to where you just were deep in the heart of the city
2674140	2676700	Cemetery as you're dragging these androids
2677620	2679620	into Ari Manstein's
2679980	2681460	tomb
2681460	2687460	You're giving him a good once over so I will need each of you to roll search
2688140	2691700	Because you each have one of these androids
2692700	2699940	30-40 didn't hear either one of you because you're both standing go Luke 31 on a 40 48 on a 50
2700660	2704120	64 on a 20 Clark. Come on, man. Clark's useless
2706740	2708740	This guy's totally lame rat dead
2709820	2711820	John the androids are dead
2712220	2719780	What else did you want to know Keith Vigna as you are dragging yours and you're kind of looking over it you remember
2719980	2726520	Fighting one of these things at James the mill workers house and you remember how strong?
2727060	2729060	the metal was and
2729140	2734140	how the wrists popped off and had wiring inside and
2734580	2738940	There were there were all sorts of gadgets kind of an inspector gadget style
2739740	2746620	Dave Bautista thing going on here and I followed the first part where it is. Yeah Bautista come in
2746620	2750900	Yeah, it's as if Dave Bautista was playing inspect your gadget. Yeah
2752860	2756900	Cool that would be that's a fun casting I would fucking love
2763100	2765100	All right podcast over
2768940	2770940	a
2771220	2773220	Friendship with podcast is ended
2780940	2783740	I mean, he's he's he's hitting like
2784580	2787800	65% right now. He's nailing it for blockbusters
2787800	2793620	So it might be more like 40 after some of those bombs so we could probably sneak in there. That's what we want
2794060	2797900	Stuber. Yeah, he did. He did. He did blow a stuber. That was a bummer
2798940	2800940	Hey Dave, we've got just
2806060	2808060	Everybody loves a reboot
2808300	2810620	Also movies are huge right now
2811740	2817960	No, it would be oh, oh my god it had Dave Bautista inspector gadget series on Disney Plus
2820660	2823020	Can we use that Mandalorian screen
2824500	2826500	That thing is fancy
2826860	2830220	I'm editing all of this out so we can actually make this happen
2830460	2835080	It's got a better chance of happening if we put it out in the world, baby. That's the secret
2835820	2839040	Did you read that didn't have to that's the secret?
2841420	2848780	Keith I forgot what I was gonna tell you. I don't know but they already have an inspector gadget in the works for Disney Plus
2850740	2855960	Who called it baby, but who's starring I haven't gotten to those starring the writers are Mikey day
2856160	2861240	What has been on SNL? He's gonna nail that and Streeter Seidel
2861920	2863920	Streeter they got Streeter Seidel
2867800	2875360	Yeah, they're also behind the Home Alone reboot for Disney Plus, I would love to see Home Alone, but Dave Bautista is the kid
2875360	2888200	Keith Vigna as you drag this thing into the mausoleum you notice that this
2889200	2891200	robot seems to have
2891240	2896680	none of the advanced features that were previously part of
2897060	2904080	The Android that you fought at the behest of you now know Maggie Cook and myriad
2904320	2908440	They're at James the mill workers house and dr. Bradley anus fuck
2911000	2914820	Do you really rely on it that much I'll change it and John Lee petty
2915720	2917200	I
2917200	2919440	Was like it was he a part of me
2922680	2924960	Dr. Bradley anus is behind it all
2927280	2929280	That asshole
2929280	2931280	It
2932040	2937720	Was there and you took it easy low-hanging fruit John Lee Kevin Moore the third as you're
2939120	2942680	Dragging this thing in by the ankles of its pants
2944080	2947940	Pants begin to fall down and instead of a Ken doll
2949200	2951600	Right there where the smooth part is
2953360	2956080	We're finally checking out these robot dogs
2956080	2958080	You
2958120	2961720	See a stamp that says property of
2962600	2967280	The city asylum well god damn this one's hands don't pop off
2969200	2972480	That's fascinating you find anything on yours
2974600	2977200	Yeah, it belongs it belonged to the city asylum
2978080	2981000	Holy shit are there any cavities to search?
2981600	2983600	Cuz just call me dr. Anus
2984440	2985840	I
2985840	2987680	Will never again
2987680	2991360	Keith I don't know if we if we told you and and filled us in a little bit
2991360	2997580	There's this other group this opposing group called the city asylum, and that's who we think McKinley and
2998540	3001640	Harrison Harrison Harrison Harrison was one of them
3001640	3008640	But then the other guy the the woman who else got dead and as a president McKinley Canada and Kennedy
3009040	3013280	Agent Kennedy we think that that's who they were working for and we told and
3013440	3016360	They kind of helped us out in the end and and was like yeah
3016440	3022520	Everybody's kind of moving around toward the same goal so so the city asylum isn't like an asylum
3022520	3030000	It's a group it seems kind of like the opposite of the circle of knowledge or maybe you're huh, so we got some of these
3030720	3034720	Robots are from them and some of these robots are from myriad
3034760	3042300	And they just got these robot if you'll excuse the metaphor inspector gadget Bautista's running around out there
3043640	3049360	Just wreaking havoc on the public doing their whims. I don't I don't stand for that
3049360	3053820	I think these people started out trying to save the world and now now it's just gotten out of hand
3053820	3060880	I mean we know Maggie's trying to take over the damn thing a small-town police chief just seems like a really unlikely and
3061360	3066640	Poor starting position to be taken over the world from but somehow she did it, so that's I
3067320	3070560	Will give her kudos there. That's some real Putin shit
3074800	3079760	Quick question do we as characters know anything about the robots being tied to
3080640	3083780	Any of the project stuff so that's the big thing
3083780	3089160	I'm blanking on is that and clarified a little bit of those connections, and I'm blanking on how it all worked out
3089160	3096600	Yeah, I thought we knew myriad had made them originally or yeah, you guys know that myriad makes these things so myriad
3096600	3100160	That's why myriad has the newer model cuz these are old, but then also
3100840	3105880	myriad decided that they were gonna start selling them to private companies and
3106560	3108560	Jim Cook's operation
3109480	3111560	operation stapler was
3112280	3114280	his respect
3114560	3117020	operation to cut down on cost
3118020	3123940	For selling to private companies so the first one we fought was like og
3124900	3126680	these are
3126680	3128680	cheaper and not
3129060	3131060	myriads
3131140	3134100	Hmm I think out loud as Keith Vigna
3134820	3142160	Boy, it was a good thing. We thought to check these bodies. Yeah, and John like takes the job one of them, and he's like
3147020	3149020	Oh
3151740	3153740	That's pretty silly don't you think was
3161900	3168040	Where we going Clark I vote I vote hit I vote heading to get my book and then heading to calm comfy camper
3168060	3170300	Okay, let's do it. I'm down
3170300	3176100	How are you guys getting to contention I start running on all fours like a horse
3176100	3178920	And I say I feel like I knew somebody that did this
3182180	3185340	It's kind of fuzzy quit Clark hop on Keith I
3187460	3194800	Don't know isn't I guess somebody's cars got to be here. Yeah, I guess drew got occupied last time so
3195180	3198280	Okay, well. I think we should take over the ambulance
3199060	3202440	Cops can do that right do we have any badges I?
3202960	3208200	Got my badge on looks real old. They're gonna know looks like you're like in a
3208840	3213440	Costume for a movie these are these are these are medical professionals
3213440	3217620	They're they're around cops all the time what we need to do is go up to a civilian
3217960	3221520	And steal their car under the guise of you being a cop. Yeah, I
3222240	3226520	Don't really mind how we get a car. Let's just go. Oh, you know what also. We're grown-ass men
3226520	3232720	Do we have wallets on us? Are you saying buy a car? I'm saying rent one. I kind of like the idea of stealing one
3234200	3238240	We could just hail a cab yeah, we could just take an uber there as
3239040	3242880	Somebody gets their phone out to order an uber. I'm like. I don't know we could steal that pretty easy
3246120	3250680	Imagine how easy it'll be to steal once we're inside the uber if we want to go with now
3250680	3254420	That's genius once we're in the vehicle. We can steal an uber well
3254420	3257900	Yeah, and also let him drive us around a little bit and see if you know is this a car
3257900	3262660	We want to steal you don't just go with the first uber. Yeah, I don't have a very good uber rating
3262660	3265420	So I'll call him Keith. What'd you do? Oh?
3266420	3272920	I've only ridden a couple times, and it's been on official police business, so they'd you know what let's not get into it
3273780	3276540	Keith has like a 2.4. He just
3278260	3280260	Why I wonder
3285100	3287100	Right, but I don't know
3291940	3298460	Excuse me dear listener, but I have to drop in here real quick with some unfortunate news
3298520	3303360	See we had to record the rest of this episode on a different day and on that day
3303540	3309620	We had issues two of them in fact the first is fine Luke. Just didn't have his newer microphone
3309620	3313860	So he's at a slightly lower quality than he will be moving forward
3313860	3321140	But the second sucks shit my laptop couldn't handle my recording and Google Docs and discord and my manatee
3321340	3326740	Masturbation meditation videos all at the same time so my voice is pretty choppy
3326780	3332980	I've been trying and trying tirelessly to figure out a way to repair this issue to no avail however
3332980	3339540	I do think the rest of this episode rules hard enough to pull the focus away from the problem in fact
3339540	3345640	You know what I actually did it on purpose to make your muscles tense while listening to this fairly
3346140	3351680	Unnerving part of the story so when you feel your jaw finally relax at the end of the episode
3351980	3354760	You'll know it worked hugs and kisses
3361300	3364060	It doesn't get you down to a 2.4
3364580	3366580	stars from just one
3366860	3370540	Incident so I think we should all describe a single
3370900	3376860	Incident that got teeth while on duty a low uber score. I will start one word at a time
3378540	3383700	Yeah, we'll go around Keith really shit
3389620	3391900	His mama
3396580	3398580	My
3401660	3406100	Okay, we do need we need to take improv lessons if we want this to be
3409260	3415020	Well hold on let me improv this one word at a time for everybody Keith really shit what his mama gave him
3415500	3423660	And forgot his police cruiser, so he called a wacky uber to drive him to the crime scene
3423660	3427220	That was really cool how we all work together
3429500	3435560	We all do a really good Thomas we should just make the one episode where all it is is a mad lib
3435740	3441620	We should do like four episodes in a row where it's just one of us talking. It doesn't sound like it would be very popular
3444320	3451260	Okay, so I like to think that Keith was out on a call and he needed to arrest someone so he handcuffs a perp
3451260	3457340	And then as he takes him back to the police cruiser you realize he locked his keys in his cruiser with the car running
3457340	3459340	so then he has to
3465180	3469100	Explains to the uber driver like this is a wanted criminal
3475100	3477100	Pop the trunk
3481260	3483260	I
3484020	3488300	Throws him in the trunk and then Keith gets in the shotgun seat of course and
3488940	3493860	Instead of going straight to the police station Keith is like I'm gonna shit with my mama gave me
3496940	3500180	He shits his pants, and then still makes the guy go through a drive-through
3503900	3505900	I shit my pants
3511860	3513860	Away, there's no trouble afterwards
3517140	3520760	Actually I was wrong that one experience might take you all the way down to
3524700	3526700	He's only been on three uber rides
3529020	3536220	Goodness so Keith pulls out his phone and orders an uber and it's you see on the app that there is a vintage
3536220	3538380	I guess it wouldn't say vintage, huh?
3538380	3541300	I wouldn't say what year the car is no
3541300	3545740	It might say what year the car is it says what year the car is once somebody agrees to pick you up
3545740	3552420	It does tell you what what the car is so one unfortunate soul does agree to pick the three of you up
3552420	3555620	I guess he doesn't know that there's three of you, and you don't know it's a he
3555620	3560460	But it does does it say his name. It's been a while since I've used you. Yeah. What's his name?
3560980	3563780	Lewis his name is Lewis, and he's driving a
3564780	3566780	1966 Toyota Prius oh
3567900	3571260	His name is Reginald, and he's driving hey
3573500	3575500	1966
3576020	3581980	Volkswagen van like a bus or like a mini. Yeah, it's like a bus. It's like a van bus
3583220	3586100	Two different things are just the same name for the same thing
3586940	3589660	Was the van this vintage teal?
3590540	3594380	Volkswagen van rolls up on the outskirts of
3594940	3601180	The city cemetery and it is driven by a man as like long hair
3601700	3603580	He looks pretty
3603580	3610100	Pretty lanky and his eyes are darting all over the place. He's kind of flinching a little bit and
3610900	3618140	You see that his shirt seems to be made from random pieces of fabric that were like patched together quilted together
3618980	3620980	Hey guys
3623700	3631060	Are you what what's your name Spud, but I'll miss but it was Lewis or Reginald
3631060	3634900	Oh, no my mom tried to name me Lewis, but my dad
3635260	3637740	He he really liked the name Reginald
3637740	3644460	And he grabs a can of whipped cream from the floorboard under his feet, and he just goes
3645460	3647460	Into his mouth
3648660	3653620	But but I'm gonna sidebar with my compatriots real quick
3653620	3659780	Is he eating the whipped cream or is he like inhaling the the gas from the can?
3659780	3660060	Yeah
3660060	3665980	Is he popping a rule search for me to see if there's a any any actual cream on that any cream?
3665980	3668460	And I'm gonna search for cream in his mouth

3681420	3683940	Dude there is a little there's a little bit of cream
3683940	3688180	There's like a little bit of cream on his lip and it seems to like at least sputtered
3688180	3693860	You know there's some he keeps his lips tight around that white
3695340	3697340	But
3697780	3699740	So you can't see it all but like yeah
3699900	3706580	So we are John leads these guys into a sidebar real quick, and it's like hey

3710060	3713500	You know can only make so many variations of his own creations
3713700	3721260	But but doesn't doesn't this guy sound a lot like that that weird creature that was looking for the overseer
3724260	3727020	I'd have to hear him. I'd have to hear him talk one more time
3727700	3730080	Do you think maybe those creatures are doing poppers, too
3731740	3733740	That's not what poppers are I
3735100	3740340	Did them one time in a hot tub at a bastard you're thinking of you're thinking of whippets Joe whippets
3740340	3745860	That's something yeah, I've never done whippets, but I did do poppers in a hot tub with a bunch of hot dudes
3745860	3748660	You know what happened to your accent Keith?
3751060	3753660	Yeah, that was Keith saying that he forgot who he was
3753660	3761660	Being Silas Cole for so long made him forget who he was yeah, I'm having like flashbacks. I'm like I'm not okay, okay
3762340	3768180	Zach you gave me like dirty looks and flipped me off, so I was asking a legitimate game strategic question
3768180	3771260	No, I I appreciate that he turns and he's like

3776500	3780540	Hey, hey, I had some I had something in my
3784260	3790480	This sidebar was a false alarm. This is just an average country feller. Just like you or me or Keith even

3807680	3810720	Yeah, if you see some freaky shit. It's cuz you're high Clark
3810720	3816080	I don't want to alarm you, but every time you've been in a cruiser with Keith, or I we have been at least
3816400	3818400	His level or beyond on
3819000	3823920	Inhalants or some other substance he hears you guys talking, and he's like nice. Hey

3834340	3836340	Oh
3836380	3844220	Sure, that's sick. Yeah, man. You're born naked and the rest is just drag dude. The rest is just ha ha and he like
3844780	3848860	grabs on his shoulder like the shirt of his shoulder the shoulder of his shirt and
3849380	3853260	He's like the rest is just rags my dude

3877620	3883040	I'm really glad that I got that thing out of my throat. I feel much more comfortable like this
3884300	3888020	I'm glad to man. I'm glad you can be comfortable. I'm glad you can just drive us
3888060	3893100	Guys doing in contention really have to say anything at all to us. No, I figure we talk
3893100	3898020	I'm one of those uber drivers who likes to talk to everybody the whole time. What are you guys doing in contention?
3898020	3902620	Huh? Do you find that people like that? I know I know dude. It's just like I get so lonely
3903420	3909340	Sometimes, you know, yeah one cool thing that an uber driver can do is just put on some some pretty
3910420	3913980	You know some pretty well-liked music radios busted man
3914060	3919220	Pretty me some music that like everybody can kind of get you know anything from the 70s basically off
3919220	3921380	I wish I could do the worst
3921940	3926960	Worst thing they could do besides talking is like put on Imagine Dragons, but they do that a lot
3926960	3932260	Would we recognize this guy from like around contention? Nah, man. I'm from the city. What are you guys?
3932260	3935620	Are you guys from contention or what born and raised here? What?
3936060	3940980	Yeah, you're from contention. That's sick, dude. I heard the cops. They're like
3941540	3947340	Bad I heard there's some crazy boys. Yeah. Yeah. What else have you heard about him? Oh, dude
3947340	3954140	I just have some friends down there who like get litty like my homie. He's the manager at this sandwich place and
3954740	3958980	Like you I mean he grows his own shit. It's fucking cool. Yeah, that's my cousin
3960420	3964980	No shit what yeah, he's a good guy. His stuff is pretty good. Oh
3966100	3969620	Dude, and he like as he's driving he turns fully around
3971780	3975740	Look you in the eyes and hands and puts on his fist to give you nuts
3975740	3979240	I quickly return his knucks and point towards the road
3980100	3982100	nice
3982180	3984180	And it's quiet for the first time
3985420	3990380	Hey, could you put something on like even Imagine Dragons at this point? Oh, like I said before
3991020	3994380	We're kind of both standing up at the same time. It's pretty crazy
3995380	3998700	But like so I couldn't hear you or you can hear me
3998700	4005320	But like radio is fucking busted I could I could sing some Imagine Dragons for you if you want. Yes, please do that
4005580	4008880	Yeah, that's for sure that that sounds great to me. Thank you
4008880	4010880	Oh
4024280	4029080	Well, maybe I need to give them boys a second chance cuz that's the best Imagine Dragons song I've ever heard I
4030080	4032080	Mean just fucking imagine them though, right?
4033080	4040080	It is evocative as hell I'm picturing them all Game of Thrones, you know one time after I think it's like smile
4040080	4044920	I read all those books in my early 20s. That's one thing. You don't know about John Lee Pettymore. Oh nice
4044920	4046920	John Lee Pettymore is your name? That's long
4048520	4050960	Yeah, it's three it's three of them
4052680	4054680	All together they're
4054880	4057880	Mean my name's spud pass bud spud
4058040	4064520	Yes, but like the beer dog like it like a tater like a tater nice and he turns fully around
4071040	4077120	Back back turn around and as you turn around you both you all see two things in the distance both are
4077320	4083960	Roughly 30 feet in the air the Sun slowly beginning its descent behind them one is
4084480	4091660	Expected it's the billboard for the contingent trucks your hometown baseball team trucks. Bring it
4092280	4097680	Trucks bring it. The other is less expected. It's a floating
4098400	4100240	four-wheeler this
4100240	4106720	Familiar all-terrain vehicle adds another terrain to its already impressive resume
4106720	4108720	As it seems
4109000	4112800	As it seems to surf on some sort of
4113440	4121620	Invisible wave roll sanity. Is this a four-wheeler occupied or just on its own up in the it's occupied as hell
4121920	4123920	It's pretty far away
4124120	4131080	Can I can I reroll my sanity? No, that's great though. If you failed it's fun. I did
4131080	4133980	I am at 18. Oh and so
4134700	4137540	Do you think 44 is a good roll
4141500	4147260	Yes, I do think 44 is a good roll Joe you put a thumbs down meaning you pass
4150260	4156580	It was luckily under my power, okay under your power and then Thomas what did you roll I failed
4157100	4161300	Okay, so it says if you pass you don't lose any sanity
4162180	4164180	Congratulations to no one
4164580	4165860	if you
4165860	4173420	Joe and Thomas both roll a d4 as Luke takes one d4 of sanity damage or I mean, sorry
4173700	4175700	Luke you take all four
4176020	4180660	That's what I figured Joe and Thomas roll a d4 as Luke rolls a d4
4183260	4186420	You guys are rolling a d4 for fun, he's actually losing the same
4187420	4191760	I didn't want to feel I didn't want you to feel left out of this interactive process
4193660	4197460	Zach I got bad news for you or good news. I hit my breaking point. Hey
4200260	4204460	This already but every time I wake up in the mausoleum, I'm one point away from my breaking point
4208580	4214020	It's fucking great and Thomas, what'd you roll? I lost to sanity okey-dokey and Luke lost four
4214020	4220060	I mean Keith Vigna lost four which puts me at fourteen. There's one thing on my notes here
4220060	4223640	It says if they pass read this I won't read that
4224220	4231300	Okay fast approaching is a massive black shiny wave the size of a tsunami
4231660	4236980	formed from the indelible viscous sludge that infiltrated your town and
4237540	4243060	Disrupted your lives inside this thrashing swell of my I wrote this already
4243100	4246900	So it's like but it disrupted your lives and now I'm thinking like what lives
4247700	4249700	We don't really sad
4250540	4254740	Jesus Christ inside this thrashing swell of muck
4255820	4262620	Thrashing bodies. Yeah, read your copy and add like any commentary or like embellishments later. Don't fucking
4264020	4266120	Hold your applause for the end, dude
4266820	4271020	If you want to add some parentheses, like what lives these miserable fucks
4271100	4273980	Okay, do that you don't know you got it I mean
4274660	4280740	Bust out of character just to throw shade. It's it's it's fine. I'm a tree birch. So
4281620	4287060	inside this thrashing swell of muck are the thrashing bodies of
4287820	4293820	councilwoman Carrie pages and Salem the cats their hands and paws
4294300	4298220	Stretch out trying to breach this inescapable tide
4298500	4305740	But their struggle does not last long their limbs fold into this ooze becoming one with a sentient
4305900	4310380	Massive goop that is about to crash down upon you
4311580	4313020	What do you do?
4313020	4319620	How fast is this wave moving? Like do we have much time? Nope, and as it collapses over you
4319620	4321620	You
4323540	4330740	It's just enough time for you to also realize that the driver is seeing what you're saying as he just goes
4331700	4333700	dude
4334380	4338220	But the dude is pretty much cut off by the wave
4338420	4343940	like the swell of like, you know when you get hit by a wave in the ocean and just kind of holds you down and
4343940	4345980	for like a moment you think it's
4346700	4348700	over
4349800	4357580	Okay, so like GAC was Nickelodeon's version of flarp or slime a toy for children made by mixing water
4357580	4365020	With borax and with my wife. I'm sorry. It's I GAC slime. Yes. What was the other thing? You said flarp?
4365660	4367660	flarp flarp flarp
4368020	4374100	FL AR I think I that's what we called it. Hang on. Wait. Wait one second. Oh shit
4374620	4381060	Does he have some floor just walked away he just like ran away with a giddy child like smile I have
4381900	4384620	It's not in the thing, but I've got the case for it. No
4387420	4389420	I don't know where
4389420	4392620	Buddy oh no, it got out noise putty. So it's the stuff
4394780	4400060	You can put your finger into it and it makes really easy fart sense. Gotcha. Yeah, okay
4400140	4405260	Or if you can't afford a pocket pussy almost as if like the the sound is that's where it went
4406140	4410460	Or if you can't afford a fuck barrel the flarp barrel. Oh, that's a patreon joke
4411860	4413860	Yeah, nobody
4418380	4424780	It's it's so good right now, I cannot wait until you make a fuck barrel the fuck barrels are gonna come out sooner than the t-shirts
4430300	4432300	Fucking hurts
4433380	4439860	The the stuff we created in our kitchen with like borax and water and liquid glue is a lot like wetter and runnier
4440460	4447300	Than the GAC like the name-brand stuff and it felt cold and wet but sort of heavy at the same time
4447300	4454580	And when the stuff moved around it peeled away like it had to like make an effort to release from your skin
4454980	4460540	What is that called where it's like when you hit it it's a solid but I was just thinking about that too
4460540	4464220	I think it's a Newtonian substance or a yeah
4465620	4472580	Newtonian yeah non-newtonian with like cornstarch or something. Is that how you used to make it? Yeah cornstarch and and like come
4473060	4476020	Oobleck oobleck. Yeah black ooh
4477380	4480420	Flarp ooh black. Okay now imagine
4480420	4482420	Dragons
4482740	4484620	Imagine the stages
4484620	4488340	the way that your thoughts change throughout this
4489180	4490420	vorish
4490420	4493100	Process as you are consumed
4493100	4499380	Oh the reason that I talked about GAC for so long is imagine that it's like literally covering your entire body at first it
4499540	4506100	Feels like jumping into a pool with your clothes on like a little strange little awkward like in the van. Yes
4506100	4510060	Oh completely. You can't see anything anymore except for darkness and
4510700	4517820	As the ooze pushes in around you it becomes increasingly difficult to move your limbs
4518380	4520380	this cold wet sludge
4520900	4529340	relentlessly fills every orifice in your body and you struggle to maintain a sense of optimism as you are
4529660	4532420	completely enveloped in this suffocating
4532980	4534700	goo
4534700	4540820	John Lee Pettymore who rolled over his power has just unbuckled his seatbelt like while he could still move
4541260	4547780	He rolled up into as much of a ball as he could, you know, this form is not really my own. I
4548380	4552220	Will survive the goo onslaught. I hope my friends will be as lucky
4552220	4557900	If not, perhaps I might rip their spines out and take their corpses if this one is ruined by the goo
4558580	4559840	Keith
4559840	4566620	After having just lost four sanity, he isn't really computing like he knows what's going on
4567080	4572240	But he's just decided it's not actually happening to him. And so he's just sitting there
4573240	4575240	Breathing in as normal. I
4575800	4578000	Think Clark tries to scream and gurgles
4579480	4581480	This isn't how it was supposed to go
4590480	4594840	So look directly into the camera right now Joe look directly into the camera right now
4601840	4606600	Dear listener, I have such mixed emotions right now
4607760	4614000	An oozing substance has just made its way into my studio and it is heading directly
4614480	4618140	Towards me on one hand. I feel like I am
4619100	4620140	Unfortunately
4620140	4623840	Staring down the empty pudding cup of my existence
4624020	4631580	But on the other hand, it kind of looks like rotting putrid slop like I said, I'm hungry
4637940	4639940	What the fuck
4648140	4650140	Oh
4678140	4680140	You
4708140	4710140	You
