0	4080	Greetings, my great greasy grandchildren.
4080	7520	It's your grease keeper god, Wolf the Dog,
7520	9960	and I'm here to recycle the grease.
9960	14240	I will turn old, dead grease into new, alive grease
14240	17840	once again by using the purifying properties
17840	19680	of my fur hairs.
19680	21720	I am the Greasier.
21720	24400	I am born unto the grease,
24400	28440	and I will return the world to grease once more.
28480	32480	Also, I'm a radio host for 694.2 PTBP.
34320	36480	Grease bless this mess.
36480	40080	This week's Howlin' with Wolf was a bit strange.
40080	42880	When I finally stopped greasin' up the joint
42880	44320	and got behind the mic,
44320	48080	I noticed an unfamiliar package on my desk,
48080	50040	shaped like a cassette tape,
50040	52960	and inside was a cassette tape,
52960	56120	and that was titled in rainbow-colored marker,
56120	60800	each letter a rotating, vibrant hue of Roy G. Biv,
60800	62120	and it read,
62120	65480	Something has been happenin' to you at night lately,
65480	68840	by a lie remains a lie,
68840	72520	and or at countless bats on Twitter.
72520	75840	There is an eight-foot, hunchbacked, wolf-muscled man
75840	78560	who opens your window quite gently at night,
78560	81000	and he climbs in and crouches beside you
81000	82480	in bed there to watch you.
82480	85320	He touches your face with his thick-knuckled hands,
85360	86640	and he opens your mouth,
86640	88760	and he works out your teeth one by one
88760	91200	to inspect them, replace them with new ones
91200	94120	he's lovingly crafted with thick-knuckled hands.
94120	97520	Terribly, slowly, his face is a factless intent,
97520	100960	and you ask me why you don't remember this happening,
100960	102720	and I tell you, you do.
104040	104880	Oh, you do.
107560	109760	Heh heh, uh heh heh, uh heh heh.
109760	112640	Well, uh, thanks from whoever sent that.
112640	116120	I definitely will be sleepin' just as soundly
116120	118200	as I had previous to listenin'
118200	120640	to that nice little piece of audio.
120640	123600	It definitely didn't scare the piss out of me
123600	125040	from sheer terror.
125040	128520	It's a good thing I have my dog, Wolf, the dog,
128520	132040	to keep me company and keeping the terror at bay
132040	134160	for yet another night.
134160	136760	If you wanna send in a strange package
136760	140000	for Wolf to play on these slick airwaves,
140040	142880	tag at PretendinPod on the internet,
142880	146960	or write up a five-star review on the Apple Podcasts.
146960	149800	I'm going to start readin' five-star reviews
149800	151560	live on air here and there,
151560	155400	so make them snappy, sloppy, and sweet, y'all.
155400	157320	Now listen to me.
157320	160720	I will click the links in the show notes.
160720	164320	I will click the links in the show notes.
164320	168920	I will click the links in the show notes.
168920	173760	I will click the links in the show notes.
173760	176760	Man, if we got old, wouldn't I know
176760	195980	that we're with me today,
198920	203200	Gigantumbropithecus.
203200	207000	A Gigantumpropithecanth.
207000	210800	An Umbagumgarbregrath.
210800	213720	Whatever that thing was, it lost its balance
213720	216600	when a clerk bishop blinded the big fucker
216600	219080	with a bright flash of face light.
219080	221720	And then the Don Jon AT-ST
221720	224440	casted a wand-focused Devil Hands,
224440	228560	which, overclocked by the sacrifice of Wheeler Fortjohn,
228560	231360	demolished the large shadow ape.
231360	234000	Planet Juggernaut gracefully turned
234000	236320	and whipped itself up into the air
236320	238280	like jumpin' out of a swing,
238280	242440	if the swing warped and dissolved into nothingness
242440	244920	as the booty achieved liftoff.
244920	249320	And the overwhelmingly enormous champion of the scrap pit
249320	252920	landed directly on top of M-A-R-Y,
252920	255460	crushin' both her and her hopes
255460	258520	to open this portal to Tildy B. Mitchell,
258520	260920	where Silas Cole had trapped her,
260920	263240	deep below Bean's pond.
263240	267120	Taking us now to the sultry dulcet tones
267120	269280	of Mick and Nick Nickles,
269280	274280	is Draggin' In 3 with What Kinda World Are You Livin' In?
274280	279280	["What Kinda World Are You Livin' In"]
304280	309280	["What Kinda World Are You Livin' In"]
313880	317080	Praise be to Planet Juggernaut,
317080	320320	the lord and savior of all who have gathered here today,
320320	323280	as well as those that exist in other variations
323280	325360	of this plane of contention.
325360	327600	Praise be, Nick Nickles!
327600	331400	Praise be, my brother from the exactly same mother.
331400	332980	Planet Juggernaut is here,
332980	336920	for he is our savior no matter the time or place or space.
336920	337760	Praise him!
337760	338760	Praise him all!
338760	342900	Hail Planet Juggernaut, born a virgin and very round.
342900	347180	Rotund Planet Juggernaut is celibate, and that's okay.
347180	348020	Hail him!
348020	349620	Hail him now, you weak idiots!
349620	353660	I personally will weep at the feet of Planet Juggernaut
353660	357620	and clean his shiny metal foundation.
357620	360660	I am already crying so many of my tears
360660	362500	for our round mound of chrome.
362900	364820	Let us use our tears to wipe away the blood
364820	367700	of all of his enemies off his shiny shoes.
367700	372700	I want his holiness, Planet Juggernaut, to come inside me.
372900	375140	I have sinned so many times in this life,
375140	377380	but Planet Juggernaut has forgiven all of them
377380	379420	and cleansed the many dimensions.
379420	381420	My sins are no longer an issue.
381420	383420	Please do not look at my sins.
383420	384820	Look at Planet Juggernaut.
384820	386940	Let's get him now!
386940	390860	Let's give him a quick talking to a post-game conference
390860	392900	here with Planet Juggernaut.
392900	396020	Planet Juggernaut, how are you feeling after today?
396020	399260	No need to thank me, Mick and Nick.
399260	401700	Just doing what I do best.
401700	404140	That's being a fighter.
404140	406840	Mick, I like your enthusiasm,
406840	408660	but obviously I won't come in you.
408660	411460	Planet Juggernaut, after a performance like today,
411460	413940	what do you think is gonna happen next?
413940	416380	What's next for Planet Juggernaut?
416380	421380	I haven't really thought about it, Mick and Nick.
421660	424020	Might just go for a little spin.
425020	426780	Wow, what a humble hero.
426780	428980	Hey, it's you guys who are the real heroes,
428980	430700	you know what I mean?
430700	431780	Catch you later.
431780	434340	It's like he's the size and shape of an Earth
434340	436100	and he's down to one.
436100	437260	That's just incredible.
437260	438740	I'm glad he finally pointed out
438740	440540	that we're the true heroes here.
440540	443380	This Planet Juggernaut, our Messiah,
443380	447180	has delivered us from both the chaos of the Scrap Pit
447180	451820	and the horrible, unsplikable monsters here in this,
451820	455340	oh, nope, oh gosh, oh Mick.
455340	456660	Oh, Planet Juggernaut.
456660	457500	What's going on, my beautiful brother?
457500	459620	Everybody needs to look up right now
459620	463300	and see this ocean of motion of wormy worm times
463300	466900	coming on down towards us slowly but surely.
466900	470220	Oh, I do not wanna be squished by those bugs.
471220	473500	I don't like looking at the worms, brother.
473500	475020	I don't like looking at them either.
475020	477540	Let's hold each other with our eyes closed.
479060	480540	I'm giving you a big hug.
480540	481380	I'm doing a hug.
481380	483140	Make that sound Justin made, both of you together,
483140	484780	like you're quivering and hugging.
490380	493780	And from below, everyone can see the top half
493780	497620	of Keith Beans up in the sky,
497620	501300	continuing to wriggle as the worms make their way
501300	506300	through his skull and attach themselves to his brain.
507420	511180	Luke, I would like to speak to you.
511180	512020	Alone?
512020	515340	I think that seeing as how we're at the end here,
515340	517820	they can sit in on it. Yeah, that's fine.
517820	522820	Keith Vigna, you are standing at six o'clock
523180	527940	on the face of a watch.
528860	532580	It's a massive, massive watch face,
532580	535380	surrounded on all sides
535380	539780	by an unnaturally wriggling ocean of darkness.
540780	545540	And as these worms begin to consume your brain,
545540	549980	you are somehow unable to die
549980	554220	and therefore your synapses are firing off
554220	558380	and connecting simultaneously to the worms
558380	561860	and across from this massive watch face
561860	564420	that you're standing on at noon,
564420	567940	floating in this endless void,
567940	571460	you see Ferguson Beans, your brother.
571460	573380	He's wearing a white suit.
573380	576220	It fits him like a glove.
576220	580380	It's got a red rose on his lapel.
580380	583340	He looks dapper as he's ever looked.
584780	589140	Aside from the bullet holes in his chest,
589140	592020	blood pouring down,
592020	595180	matching his flowery lapel,
595180	598700	his corsage with the blood
598700	603180	that is now leaking through his white suit.
603180	604820	And when he sees you,
604820	606940	he begins walking slowly
606940	611620	across this massive watch face toward you.
614980	616180	How close is he to me?
616180	618900	Suddenly he's standing right before you
618900	621660	and he falls to his knees, weeping.
622500	623340	Keith.
628540	630340	Keith, I'm so sorry.
631340	635660	I'm sorry, why, what?
635660	637460	Why are you sorry?
637460	640620	They made me, they made me into who I am
640620	645620	and I'm so sorry of the way I treated you.
645980	646820	Who did?
646820	647660	Bob and Dad.
647660	648780	You were always kind of mean.
648780	651740	They turned me against you at such a young age.
651740	652780	Why did they?
652780	655500	They were trying to make me into something,
655500	658620	something that could handle what was going for all of us.
658620	662780	Well, I'm sorry, but they chose the wrong son.
662780	666540	I'm, I think I saved something.
667420	670980	I'm sorry you had to die for it.
670980	675300	You're kind of like a savior in your own right.
675300	676140	Well, I feel,
678100	679500	I feel like a martyr.
679500	682740	Do martyrs know that they've done something wrong?
682740	684140	Do they all deserve it?
689620	690460	Yes.
694180	695580	I don't know a lot.
695580	698900	So is that the answer you wanted?
698900	700500	And he's just crying.
700500	702340	Keith doesn't know what martyr means.
705700	707860	A murderer, you say?
707860	709620	Is that the one that is half goat?
712420	715460	I just, I never wanted to turn you against,
715460	718340	I didn't know exactly what I was doing.
718940	721500	Our relationship and how important I think it would be
721500	725380	later in life to actually get to know you.
725380	727380	I was just always jealous of you.
727380	730340	And I still loved you.
730340	732020	I do still love you.
732020	736380	I was, I think about you.
736380	737460	Why did you do it?
738500	741340	To be completely honest, I don't know.
741340	745100	There was some kind of hate in me from a young age
745100	746220	that just lived there.
746220	750620	And I, you know, I didn't realize how much was in me
750620	754500	until an opportunity arose.
754500	756220	Did you get it out?
756220	760980	Did you at least, did you get it all out of your system?
760980	762220	Are you okay now?
763460	764580	I've been better.
768540	769660	Did Fergie just ask him
769660	772260	if he got his hatred out by killing him?
772260	773100	Yeah.
773100	773940	What a guy.
774940	779940	Keith embraces Ferguson and weeps with him.
782980	784420	As we turn away from that scene,
784420	785660	here's what's about to happen.
785660	788380	I am going to set the scene of what's all going on
788380	790340	here in the aftermath of the defeat
790340	793020	of the Gigantum Burpithecus and M-A-R-Y,
793020	794980	as well as the closure of the portal,
794980	797180	which removed the additional threat
797180	800740	and all around rough time of dealing with Tildy B. Mitchell.
800740	803660	And then after I describe what's going on
804260	806060	with the NPCs that are here,
806060	811060	you'll have one D-12 plus four minutes.
812300	814820	I have a handy dandy timer here on the screen
814820	818140	next to Justin's handsome little mug.
818140	819580	Why did I say that?
819580	824380	And when the one D-12 plus four minutes run out,
824380	828380	this ocean made of unimaginably slippery
828380	832140	little pulsating membranes with two sets of sharp teeth
832140	835060	inside each adorable circular mouth
835060	837180	will come crashing down.
837180	838940	And these little guys will latch on
838940	841500	to every last one of you.
841500	843780	So you'll need to figure out how to deal with that
843780	845660	in your allotted time.
845660	848740	But also some people might feel the need to catch up.
848740	852380	And if there's anything else you wanna do or grab or use,
852380	855180	maybe the phone or the broken radio
855180	857180	up at the top of the shadowy building,
857180	860540	the grabbing or using would presumably need to happen
860540	865100	before you each go into your own tiny worm dream hole
865100	869100	for the foreseeable forever of your character.
869100	874100	So let's roll a D-12.
874100	876340	Who wants to do it?
876340	877380	Joe. Joe.
877380	878220	Joe.
878220	879060	Joe.
879060	879900	Joe.
879900	881740	Joe.
881740	882580	All right, sure.
882580	883420	One D-12 plus four.
883420	884460	Don't fuck this up, Joe.
886180	887260	It's a 12.
887260	889340	No, I don't think so.
890340	891980	It's a three.
891980	893020	Oh.
893020	894500	So we got seven minutes.
894500	896140	Fuck.
896140	896980	Seven minutes.
896980	897980	Thomas, did you just roll a one?
897980	899300	Yeah, but I sure did.
902100	904660	You're like, don't worry, I'll save us.
904660	906820	Oh, I thought it was a D-12 plus a D-4.
906820	909220	It's just one D-12 plus four.
909220	910060	Yep.
910060	911020	Thank, okay, cool.
911020	911860	Thank you.
911860	912780	What a kind DM.
912780	914660	Seven minutes is a good amount of time.
914660	917860	Well, let's just pair up and go into the closet.
917860	919260	Oh.
920140	921300	Nice.
921300	922140	I got it.
922140	922980	Time to go to heaven.
922980	923820	Slowly.
923820	925500	A room full of people who are not invited
925500	926660	to play that game.
929340	931980	Hey, yeah, same.
931980	933940	So like, what happens in there?
937220	940060	All right, I'm setting the timer now at seven minutes.
940060	944300	I will click start when I tell you that I'm clicking start.
944300	945780	Click pause really quick.
945780	946940	No timer has happened yet.
946940	949660	So I was a little confused about the order of events here.
949660	951380	We can do whatever we want right now,
951380	952940	and then the seven minutes starts.
952940	955380	No, we can do whatever we want for seven minutes.
955380	956700	Yep, I thought it was gonna be longer,
956700	959660	but we'll have seven minutes out of character
959660	963260	and in character, just seven minutes total
963260	965100	before the worms come down.
965100	965940	So, okay, you're like,
965940	967500	there's a radio at the top of the tower.
967500	969140	Did any of our characters discover that yet?
969140	969980	Keith saw it.
969980	970820	Keith saw it, okay.
970820	972420	I saw what?
972420	974820	Yeah, so, no.
974820	975820	I didn't hear what you said.
975820	977580	Oh, Don saw it.
977580	978420	Yeah, Don saw it too.
978420	980260	Yeah, what did I see?
980260	981380	The radio.
981380	983860	Oh yeah, I saw the radio and I used the phone,
983860	985540	so I know it's there too.
985540	989660	And I have been positively reinforced by the phone
989660	992540	because I gotta make flurry.
995660	996500	I'm back.
996500	997340	Back in the New York groove.
997340	998660	Now Thomas is gone.
998660	1000740	Back in the Maybound town.
1000740	1002780	Pissing my pants downtown.
1002780	1005100	Pissing fast, pants are down.
1005140	1007140	Peeing in my little pants.
1007140	1010380	Doo, doo, doo, pee in my little pants.
1010380	1013140	Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
1013140	1015220	I wanna piss my pants.
1015220	1017060	Pants.
1017060	1020380	I wanna piss my pants.
1020380	1024060	Oh, I tell you something.
1025020	1027900	I wanna piss your pants.
1028900	1031100	Lie.
1031100	1036100	All I want is, I wanna piss your pants.
1036180	1039820	I wanna piss your pants.
1039820	1042780	Are you peeing on someone else's pants in this?
1042780	1044060	No, pissing in them.
1044060	1045180	You don't wanna hold my pants.
1045180	1048900	And when you piss them, I feel happy.
1048900	1052540	Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
1052540	1056540	A warm feeling, let that stain.
1056580	1058300	It can't hurt.
1058300	1059980	It can't hurt.
1059980	1062820	It can't hurt.
1062820	1066460	What about Dave Matthews band, Piss?
1066460	1067740	Piss into me.
1067740	1070260	Piss into me.
1070260	1072580	Hey, we do something with making my way downtown yet?
1072580	1073420	Yeah.
1073420	1074580	Are you ready?
1074580	1075860	Oh, are you ready?
1075860	1077780	Absolutely not, this is crazy.
1077780	1079380	Yeah, I definitely thought this was happening
1079380	1080220	tomorrow night.
1083580	1085100	The Luminous Land Liturgy,
1085100	1088420	which includes Drew Andrews, Councilwoman Carrie Pages,
1088420	1091220	Gary Daley, Mildred Mitchell, Clara Blankenship,
1091220	1094220	Casey Kristoff, Everett Pace, Jack Perlman,
1094220	1097580	Greer Hilfintop, Kermonkernau, the saloon bartender
1097580	1100220	and piano player, as well as a gambler named Thomas,
1100220	1102220	along with myriad animals,
1102220	1104700	either held, perched, or healing.
1104700	1109500	Keith, you see, Bean is running happily, tongue akimbo,
1109500	1113340	and this entire group continues to bob and weave
1113340	1115780	in a ceaseless musical number
1115780	1119780	at the unnatural direction of the overseer,
1119780	1124220	though their voices quiet down to an eerie whisper
1124220	1128260	as they dart around uncontrollably.
1128260	1131780	Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ah, all for the overseer.
1131780	1135260	Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ah, all for the overseer.
1135260	1138700	Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ah, all for the overseer.
1138700	1141740	Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ah, all for the overseer.
1141740	1145820	The myriad begin to speak in unison.
1145820	1150820	We appreciate the efforts of subject 1522518195518,
1154100	1159060	your attempt to destroy the countless alternative timelines.
1159060	1161780	It garners our respect.
1161780	1166780	However, plane 1620216 still has far too many variants.
1167020	1169180	It is unstable.
1169180	1173140	We have decided it is best to just shut it down
1173140	1174900	and try again.
1174900	1179340	For your own safety, please stay here.
1179340	1182540	We will repeat ourselves one more time,
1182540	1187340	fearing you either did not listen or did not hear.
1187340	1192340	For your own safety, please stay here.
1193020	1196100	And with that, this myriad of lanky skin,
1196100	1199380	thin, thin-skinned, thin-skinned creatures
1199380	1204420	in black suits just pops out of this existence.
1204420	1208100	You have seven minutes until the horrible ocean
1208100	1212660	of little mouths and huge worms drowns everyone
1212660	1217660	in the endless isolation of their own unsound minds,
1218020	1220980	starting with the last one.
1221020	1223980	Starting now.
1223980	1225820	What was the number that the overseer,
1225820	1228860	that the myriad referred to this plane as?
1228860	1231020	I've translated it before, he's given it to us before.
1231020	1232860	It's PTBP.
1234140	1235060	Nice.
1235060	1237020	Glad I didn't spend seven minutes on that.
1237020	1240220	Overseer wants to yell to the masses,
1240220	1241780	I think I can send you back.
1241780	1242980	You don't have to stay here,
1242980	1245300	but I can get you back to your own places.
1245300	1247220	And he wants to try that.
1247220	1250380	He wants to look at Clark, make eye contact with him
1250620	1252060	and the plan is to create portals
1252060	1255100	that send them back to their timelines, not to ours.
1255100	1256260	The overseer.
1257460	1258300	Okay.
1258300	1259700	When you say theirs, not ours.
1259700	1261700	Can you pause the time while you think?
1263380	1265460	Those creatures just said that they can't stay in here
1265460	1266660	because there's too many vectors.
1266660	1269460	They can't stay in the PTBP plane or whatever.
1269460	1271620	So I was gonna send them to other,
1271620	1273300	where they got plucked from.
1273300	1275540	So the Old West guys go back to the Old West.
1275540	1278700	Go ahead and roll a natural real quick for the overseer.
1281380	1282900	69.
1282900	1284460	It's a 69.
1284460	1285300	Wow.
1285300	1286140	Fuck.
1286140	1287420	It's a straight 69.
1287420	1289620	That's the best 69 I could've rolled.
1289620	1290460	Holy shit, really?
1290460	1291300	I could've rolled.
1291300	1293860	Amazing.
1293860	1295340	It just keeps happening.
1295340	1296740	Okay, so in this moment,
1296740	1299860	you know that the plane 1620216
1299860	1301660	that Myriad is talking about
1301660	1305700	is the entire existence of your world.
1305700	1309460	And so there are many different infinite variations
1309460	1311700	on that world that are all considered
1311700	1315860	to be plane 1620216.
1315860	1318620	However, with a 69,
1318620	1323500	I am going to change the entire idea
1323500	1326460	that I had and allow the overseer
1326460	1329580	who has dedicated his entire life
1329580	1332140	to jumping between these little planes
1332140	1334860	that exist all over 1620216.
1334900	1338260	He has the ability now to send
1338260	1341500	each of these Luminous Land Liturgy members
1341500	1343900	to their respective existences
1343900	1345500	wherever they happen to come from.
1345500	1349180	However, based on what Myriad has told you,
1349180	1353340	they plan to shut down that entire plane.
1353340	1355540	So you can send those people
1355540	1360260	to go end their lives wherever they belong,
1360260	1363020	but that is essentially what you will be doing.
1363020	1366180	I wish we hadn't started the seven minutes yet.
1366180	1367340	We're like halfway.
1369420	1372540	I could send everybody back
1372540	1374820	and then take the fight to Myriad.
1374820	1379820	Keith feels himself dying above him somehow.
1380340	1383100	And he realizes he's like,
1383100	1385060	I'm gonna die again.
1385060	1386720	I'm gonna die here.
1386720	1388940	And he looks around and he sees the people
1388940	1392020	that he's gotten into this mess with
1392060	1393320	and he just yells,
1393320	1394740	Drew, Drew, Drew.
1399540	1400580	Where's Drew at?
1400580	1402620	He's chanting, he's whispering,
1402620	1403700	Sha-ka-tay.
1403700	1405660	But in the voice of Councilwoman Carrie Pages.
1405660	1407940	Keith goes up and grabs Drew.
1407940	1409740	Is the Councilwoman here too?
1409740	1411900	The body of Councilwoman Carrie Pages
1411900	1413900	has Drew Andrews inside of it
1413900	1417300	and the body of Drew Pages,
1417300	1420340	Drew Andrews has Councilwoman Carrie Pages inside of it.
1420340	1422940	I could just go grab both of them.
1422940	1423780	Follow me.
1423780	1425700	They are very much,
1425700	1427460	I grab them by the ears and pull them
1427460	1429920	and run towards the castle thing.
1429920	1430760	Okay.
1430760	1431900	They are still chanting
1431900	1433860	and desperately want to get away from you,
1433860	1435460	but in that moment,
1435460	1438140	the overseer has the option to release them
1438140	1439260	from their bind.
1439260	1440660	Clark.
1440660	1441780	He drops,
1442660	1444720	he knows that for them to get anywhere,
1444720	1446820	we have to drop this spell.
1446820	1448100	So yeah, he drops it.
1448100	1449660	Okay, completely for everyone?
1450340	1453140	Uh, no, just those two for now.
1453140	1455620	He needs the power that he can keep.
1455620	1456460	Yeah, okay.
1456460	1458860	So then immediately you're getting like a,
1458860	1460940	oh my God, oh my gosh.
1460940	1462860	Why, what is going,
1462860	1463940	what is going on here?
1463940	1464760	Drew, Drew.
1464760	1465600	No, I'm Carrie.
1465600	1467260	Carrie, Drew and Carrie.
1467260	1468100	Yes.
1468100	1468940	We're gonna die.
1468940	1469760	Drew here.
1469760	1470600	We're gonna die.
1470600	1471420	Yes.
1471420	1472260	And if I'm gonna die,
1472260	1473280	I wanna die with Drew and Drew's body.
1473280	1474740	Let's get you switched.
1474740	1475580	Okay.
1475580	1476420	Follow me.
1476420	1477240	Come on, run.
1477240	1478080	And they run after you.
1478080	1478900	We have 90 seconds left.
1478900	1479740	So they're running.
1479980	1480820	What are you, the other two doing?
1480820	1483020	Can Clark, by time,
1483020	1486300	can he try and do a spell that pushes the ceiling back?
1486300	1487120	Yes.
1487120	1488300	Go ahead and roll a natural.
1492740	1493580	60.
1493580	1496520	Passes both Clark and the Overseer.
1496520	1499780	Give me some sort of a magical chance here.
1499780	1501860	Both Clarks look up in the sky
1501860	1503580	and because they're kind of linked now,
1503580	1504940	they both know what's going on
1504940	1507300	and they put both their hands up
1507300	1509220	and they start chanting.
1509220	1512900	R-S-T-L-N-E.
1512900	1517900	R-S-T-L-N-E.
1518220	1519060	Fuck yeah.
1521420	1526420	And I am clicking pause on the timer at 30 seconds.
1527020	1528380	They love goosebumps.
1531260	1532100	Why aren't we paused?
1532100	1533540	Because of the spell.
1533540	1534860	You would be seeing how much we bought
1534860	1536300	or is it just pause paused?
1536300	1541120	Go ahead and roll another d12 by itself.
1548740	1549580	Four.
1549580	1550420	Four.
1550420	1551240	Four more.
1552500	1553340	Beautiful.
1553340	1557580	Well now we have, it just seems like almost too much time.
1561580	1564240	And with four minutes and 30 seconds left.
1565200	1566640	Oh shit.
1568000	1571880	So we've got a John and a Planet Juggernaut still in play.
1571880	1572800	That is correct.
1572800	1575620	So Planet Juggernaut just shoots up into the air
1575620	1577560	and opens its giant Pac-Man mouth
1577560	1580840	and starts eating Xenonibatodes like the fucking krill.
1586280	1589160	And John is gonna pitch in and try to help the Overseer
1589160	1593400	and he might even start throwing chunks of the muck world
1593400	1597400	up as like flak pieces towards the Xenonibatodes
1597400	1600040	trying to blast maybe even a hole
1600040	1602320	just above us in the circle.
1602320	1603140	Cool.
1603140	1603980	Super dope.
1603980	1606600	If it's not bottomless and endless forever and ever.
1606600	1607440	Worms.
1607440	1608360	Amen.
1608360	1611700	Thomas, go ahead and roll a d100.
1615840	1616720	91.
1616720	1617960	Well, that's not gonna do it.
1617960	1619520	He eats 91 Xenonibatodes.
1621240	1622080	That's a good number.
1622080	1622920	You do what?
1623360	1624200	You gotta tell me what I'm rolling for
1624200	1625680	so I can tent the dice.
1625680	1627520	Yeah, he can pray.
1629920	1631760	Go ahead and roll a natural for John.
1633620	1634660	John Ball.
1637840	1638840	That's a failure.
1638840	1640520	That's an 85 on a 67.
1640520	1642160	Oh no.
1642160	1643040	Okay, unable.
1643040	1646920	So cutting to the top of the tower, we've got a dark room.
1646920	1648040	It is pitch black.
1648040	1651040	Keith Vigna is running in with Councilwoman Kerry Pages
1651040	1654600	and Drew Andrews and he makes it to this very,
1654600	1658520	very dark room at the top of the shadowy tower.
1658520	1660680	He starts to feel really calm.
1666680	1670000	And he's getting real sleepy and warm.
1672160	1673000	Yep.
1675860	1677800	And he realizes what's happening to him
1677800	1679640	and he looks at Drew.
1679640	1681800	You gotta do it, buddy.
1681800	1684200	And then he lays down on the ground.
1684200	1685400	I gotta do what?
1685400	1686240	I gotta do what?
1686240	1690160	Bubblegum tree, bubblegum tree, what am I supposed to do?
1690160	1693440	The radio, that's how the cat switched.
1693440	1694720	I can't see anything.
1694720	1696840	Yeah, I can't see anything in here either.
1696840	1698560	Who do you think is at fault?
1698560	1699920	That's super nice.
1703960	1705640	And Drew Andrews and Kerry Pages
1705640	1707920	are just arguing back and forth and confused.
1707920	1710280	They begin to start feeling all over the room,
1710280	1712960	trying to find anything in the room.
1712960	1716280	And Drew immediately finds the radio.
1716280	1719160	Kerry can't find anything, but Drew's like,
1719160	1720280	I think I have it.
1720280	1722440	I'm almost positive that I have it, sir.
1722440	1723280	Do it.
1723280	1724120	Do what?
1724120	1726240	Press some buttons on it and get it working.
1726240	1728120	I don't, I'm feeling around.
1728120	1730240	The goo, get some goo or something.
1730240	1732040	Get some goo?
1732040	1734040	Or just lay down and chill.
1734880	1738480	30 seconds.
1738480	1740120	Okay, Keith, I roll a D100.
1740120	1742880	If you can roll under 30,
1742880	1745800	I'll let Drew get out of this room with this thing.
1747000	1747840	32.
1749640	1750480	Fuck.
1750480	1753000	We just need to get out of here before the sea falls.
1753000	1755400	So Overseer's just doing a giant portal
1755400	1756760	under the ground of all of us
1756760	1758560	and just dropping us into wherever.
1760560	1761440	If that doesn't work,
1761440	1763760	John asks the nematodes politely to stop.
1764040	1769040	Okay.
1769160	1774160	Okay, so I've paused it at one second left on this timer.
1774560	1777240	He did hit it exactly when there was one second left
1777240	1778080	on the timer.
1778080	1779560	Which was right after Joe said he opened the portal,
1779560	1780400	which was pretty dope.
1780400	1783200	So let's go ahead and get that roll off time
1783200	1786080	of dropping this world down.
1791000	1792640	It's a pass, 52.
1792640	1793760	Okay, roll a D12.
1797160	1798000	Two.
1799120	1800600	No!
1800600	1802360	Two minutes starting, meow.
1802360	1804800	And so the whole entire floor,
1804800	1809800	this lit land all over everywhere that you can see just,
1810080	1811280	oh, would it be cooler if,
1811280	1812880	yeah, it'd be cooler if there were walls.
1812880	1815000	It'd be cool if the two minutes start after
1815000	1818200	you say all this shit. Shut the fuck up, dude.
1818200	1820240	I hate it when you're right, it's stupid.
1820240	1823880	You're like, hold on, give me a couple minutes
1823880	1824720	to come up with a cool description.
1824720	1826880	Hold on, guys, it's gonna be cooler.
1826880	1827720	Two minutes.
1829640	1830880	Do you want to describe what happens?
1830880	1833080	I was just picturing that he encompassed
1833080	1835720	every piece of land that is occupied by people now.
1835720	1837840	So it includes the tower, I think.
1837840	1841320	And then my chanters and wherever Juggernaut is
1841320	1844320	and John Ball and Don.
1844320	1847400	And it's a perfect circle around all of that
1847400	1851440	that just drops down, leaving giant white walls
1851440	1853480	all around us in a giant circle.
1853480	1854960	It's so bright in here.
1854960	1856520	Yeah, it's very bright in here.
1858840	1860240	Is it bright in the room now?
1860240	1861080	Yes.
1863160	1865160	That's what I meant to do, for sure.
1865160	1866120	Wake you up.
1866120	1868160	And the timer starts now.
1868160	1870680	Drew Andrews grabs onto the radio
1870680	1873320	and the rest of you outside see him
1873320	1874960	running out the front door.
1874960	1876640	Councilwoman Carrie pages his body,
1876720	1879320	sprinting out across the land toward you,
1879320	1880920	holding this broken radio.
1880920	1883720	And Keith, I'm following behind, running after him.
1883720	1885160	And I'm going, fuck!
1887080	1889160	I wanted to die in peace!
1890200	1891040	Don.
1891040	1893160	Don starts chanting,
1893160	1898160	Vis-a-girl, Vis-a-girl, Vis-a-girl.
1898680	1902440	And he's hoping to rewind some fucking time.
1902440	1904720	Roll Unnatural for me, please.
1905720	1907600	Oh no, I thought since it was cool,
1907600	1908840	you'd just let me do it.
1910600	1912320	52 on 70.
1912320	1913160	Yeah.
1913160	1917080	Yes, you look over and what do you see?
1917080	1919840	You look over and where you had expected
1919840	1923920	to maybe see your brother, nephew chanting with you
1923920	1925440	and aiding you once again,
1926480	1931480	you see a cartoonishly crisp black skeleton
1932480	1935200	where this John Lee Kevin Moore used to be.
1935200	1938560	And you can tell all of them went into that last spell
1938560	1940680	that you cast against the Gigantopyrthicus.
1940680	1945640	There is a charred one inch in diameter sphere
1945640	1948920	sitting on the ground in between you
1948920	1950280	and your brother and nephew.
1951400	1956400	And you have all of the strength in this moment to just.
1956640	1960640	Just purr-gossive, purr-gossive, purr-gossive.
1961840	1964640	Push back time.
1965920	1970480	I think you see tears coming down from Don's face
1970480	1972280	whenever he sees the charred corpse.
1972280	1976000	And then they start like, before they hit the ground,
1976000	1979960	they start coming back into his tear ducts.
1979960	1981080	That's so cool.
1981080	1983520	That's fucking awesome.
1986960	1990000	I'm gonna put seven minutes back on the clock.
1990000	1992040	The original time that you had
1992040	1995320	immediately after Myria disappeared.
1995320	1999440	And you are reset exactly where you were.
1999440	2001000	Everything moves in reverse.
2001000	2004440	The floor moves all the way back up
2004440	2008080	and becomes level with the ground around it.
2008080	2010440	The tower is dark once again,
2010440	2013280	but Keith runs backwards.
2013280	2014680	Drew Andrews and Carrie.
2015080	2019200	The chief leacher for the overseer.
2019200	2020880	And begin whispering once again.
2020880	2024840	And the seven minutes starts right now.
2024840	2027040	Kevin Lee John Moore sees you guys
2027040	2029240	back in your original places.
2029240	2034240	He shouts, he shouts, overseer, floor, Keith, radio.
2034480	2036560	And then he shouts, juggernaut, get him.
2036560	2038840	And juggernaut wants to try to do it again.
2039880	2041360	Yeah, while this is happening,
2041360	2043680	Keith gets his phone out of his pocket,
2043680	2046000	turns the light on and runs to the tower.
2047200	2048920	And overseer's dropping the floor again.
2048920	2050320	Just give us some light in this area.
2050320	2051160	Okay.
2051160	2052000	And more time again.
2052000	2054120	Oh yeah, and I'll do the spell.
2054120	2055040	I'll do both.
2055040	2056880	Okay, go ahead and roll.
2056880	2058620	Back to back on natural rolls.
2060760	2062080	One of them doesn't work.
2062080	2062920	Okay.
2062920	2063920	The other one does.
2063920	2065920	32, so I'm gonna do the floor.
2065920	2068060	Okay, so you're able to drop the floor down.
2068060	2069320	Go ahead and roll a D12.
2071640	2072480	10.
2072480	2073480	Oh!
2073480	2074320	Nice!
2074320	2075160	Nice!
2075160	2076960	That's some juicy time!
2076960	2078920	All right, and 16 minutes begins.
2078920	2081600	Boom, the floor drops down once again,
2081600	2085120	illuminating the entirety of this cylinder
2085120	2086840	that you've trapped yourselves in,
2086840	2090380	much like the cylinder that the Gigantum Rapithecus
2090380	2092360	was trapped in when you arrived.
2093360	2095520	The difference in the time that we just did,
2095520	2098040	he drops it so much further down than he did last time.
2098040	2099480	Yeah, oh my god.
2099480	2101200	Literal tower of terror shit.
2101200	2102040	Yeah.
2102480	2103600	He created an elevator.
2103600	2106000	Planet Juggernaut, please go ahead and roll
2106000	2108480	some form of athletics or dexterity,
2108480	2111320	which we'll call a 70%.
2114560	2115400	93.
2115400	2116240	Damn!
2117480	2118840	93 worms down.
2119960	2121440	Planet Juggernaut jumps up.
2121440	2122920	That's two worse than the last time.
2122920	2126360	Once again, and just like biting for the sky.
2126360	2128400	The ground drops out from under your feet
2128400	2129480	as you're trying to jump,
2129480	2131920	and you just can't quite reach.
2132760	2137760	And then you fall so far down into this long cylinder
2137760	2140680	into the bottom, much like a can of beans
2140680	2144000	that you're now one of these many, many baked fellas
2144000	2147680	down at the bottom of this saucy, saucy barrel.
2149000	2149880	Keith Vigna.
2149880	2152360	He runs to the radio,
2152360	2154400	and he wants to go grab the phone as well,
2154400	2157200	and then run back to the Drew crowd.
2157200	2160800	Okay, go ahead and roll strength or dexterity
2160800	2163040	or athletics.
2163040	2167680	Carrying a large old radio and a rotary phone
2167680	2168920	is difficult business.
2171160	2172400	I dropped the radio.
2174880	2175920	You hold onto the phone?
2175920	2176760	Yeah.
2176760	2177600	Okay, you can choose.
2177600	2179640	Well, I've got both in my hands,
2179640	2181520	and as I like take off,
2181520	2185200	I have the receiver of the phone in my hand,
2185200	2188200	but like the base of it is still just sitting there,
2188200	2191240	and I run and the cord jerks me,
2191240	2192920	and I drop the radio,
2192920	2195080	and it's like sitting busted on the ground,
2195080	2198200	and I grab the base of the phone and start running
2198200	2201000	and seeing if I can hear anything in the receiver.
2201000	2202880	Hello, hello, hello.
2202880	2204840	Hello, hello, hello.
2204840	2206400	Hello, hello, hello.
2206400	2208840	Shabababee, shabadoo, shababee.
2208840	2210280	Go ahead and roll a natural.
2214160	2217280	You have absolutely no idea.
2217360	2218400	Oh, damn.
2218400	2219240	How'd it connect?
2219240	2220320	He rolled really high.
2222040	2224000	89 or 89?
2224000	2225840	I have a 79, so that sucks.
2225840	2227920	Oh, damn.
2227920	2230520	Yeah, I'm still running back to the crowd,
2230520	2232520	just gibberishing into the...
2232520	2234220	You have time to go back for the radio.
2234220	2235720	We've got so much time now.
2235720	2239420	Like, we could take real life poop breaks.
2239420	2242260	Like...
2242260	2244000	Shabababee, shabababee.
2244000	2246040	And I'm, yeah, I'm just standing there,
2246240	2249800	looking at the radio, talking gibberish into the phone,
2249800	2251800	trying to think, what the fuck am I gonna do?
2251800	2255640	Young Clark remembers that he had a vision a long time ago
2255640	2259240	about the Overseer in a dark room lit by a candle,
2259240	2260280	and he looks back at that tower
2260280	2262280	and sees that that's what that was.
2262280	2264440	And he yells up, do you know anything about the phone?
2264440	2265600	Can we use that?
2265600	2268520	And as you talk to yourself,
2268520	2273160	you know that you've used the phone once or twice.
2273200	2276400	However, each time that you've used it,
2276400	2281000	they have found you on your next time
2281000	2285180	going into a myriad different forms of existence
2285180	2287280	that you're popping in to try to save
2287280	2289640	each of these towns of contention.
2289640	2293500	And an impossible task the Overseer has placed upon himself,
2293500	2296940	but he does not like being chased,
2296940	2299240	and every single time he is going
2299240	2300940	and fucking with time and existence,
2300940	2304620	he is being chased by these tall, gaunt men.
2304620	2306580	I mean, I don't know, in character or out of character,
2306580	2308460	the point is we have to get out of here.
2308460	2309300	Once we get out of here,
2309300	2313220	we might have more time out wherever we end up, right?
2313220	2314820	It's just the sea that's collapsing on us
2314820	2316620	that's giving this time requirement, right?
2316620	2320700	Yeah, and just the words of myriad ring in your head,
2320700	2324920	for your own safety, please stay here.
2325920	2330700	And you know, in Clark's mind and the Overseer's mind,
2330700	2333420	the Overseer has been able to make jumps
2333420	2336820	into plane 1620216,
2336820	2340060	a plane that he is from and familiar with.
2340060	2344580	He has been unable or scared to jump to a different plane.
2344580	2348460	Can I, quote unquote, Clark Young,
2348460	2349860	help him and convince him?
2349860	2352580	We gotta try, we gotta get somewhere else.
2352580	2354900	You got more juice here than you've ever had before, right?
2354900	2356220	This hasn't happened before.
2356220	2358540	This has to be all new to you, and I'm here now.
2358540	2360460	We can go to another one.
2361060	2362420	We don't have to be in this one.
2362420	2366860	Hey, could he send them to another one?
2366860	2368500	And John points up.
2368500	2370740	Clark, young Clark, wide-eyed, just looking at Overseer.
2370740	2373600	Yeah, yeah, we already stopped him for a minute.
2373600	2375580	We can do something to him.
2375580	2377960	We can send them not here.
2377960	2381220	The Overseer's wide-eyed begins nodding.
2381220	2383020	Is it as easy as using that telephone?
2383020	2383900	Wait, hang on though.
2383900	2385640	The reason we were gonna get out of this plane
2385640	2387540	was because they were gonna destroy it.
2387540	2389220	They were saying it's gonna be purged
2389220	2390300	or whatever they said.
2390980	2393500	That's every existence that you have ever known
2393500	2396860	in all of the different forms of you that have ever known.
2396860	2397900	It's that whole plane.
2397900	2399380	On PTBP plane.
2399380	2401260	But that's, so my original thing was,
2401260	2402460	let's go to a new plane.
2402460	2403660	Yep, 100%.
2403660	2407420	So let's get us out of here instead of the nematodes.
2407420	2409140	Sure, yeah.
2409140	2412120	Thought it would be nice to save our world.
2412120	2413260	It's all homey.
2413260	2414460	Yeah.
2414460	2418020	But I guess it's better to save the 13 people here
2418020	2423020	instead of our entire plane of existence.
2424260	2426220	I mean, that's 100% a good point.
2426220	2428580	Wait, but Myriad now is gonna destroy it.
2428580	2432460	Anyway, this whole plane, everybody in it, not just us.
2432460	2433540	All that.
2433540	2435100	Keith, didn't you make Myriad?
2436980	2438780	I can't hear you, I'm too far away.
2444300	2446800	Keith is on the phone, he's like, fuck.
2446800	2449560	And he just throws the phone down, grabs the radio
2449560	2450840	and starts running back.
2450840	2452960	Did he want to be say my name?
2452960	2454960	Yeah, didn't you make Myriad?
2457120	2458000	Probably.
2458000	2460920	Well then make Myriad not do this.
2460920	2462240	Stop!
2462240	2466220	Just screaming futilely at the heavens.
2466220	2468680	The wormy wormy heavens.
2468680	2470480	I'm your dad.
2470480	2471320	I made you.
2473240	2474080	Stop!
2474920	2479920	I get it Myriad, he is a shit father, a terrible creator.
2480840	2484280	I hate him, I hate that he's my god and daddy,
2484280	2487360	but he made me too.
2487360	2489520	Why don't you just stop with all this foolishness
2489520	2492240	and just come on back down to this plane here.
2492240	2493080	Go to your room.
2493080	2494680	And we've got roughly six minutes to talk about it
2494680	2496680	before you have to destroy the place.
2496680	2498200	Last time you were here, I think,
2498200	2500080	actually we had a lot less time maybe
2500080	2501800	and you just like, you were boogying,
2501800	2503720	but we've got more time now.
2504240	2505080	Brother, Myriad?
2505080	2506000	Roll Persuade.
2511080	2512360	47 on a 60.
2512360	2517360	A single, tall, gaunt, translucent skinned creature
2518480	2522320	appears in between you, Keith,
2522320	2525240	and the phone that has fallen on the ground.
2525240	2526640	I knew they'd listen to me.
2531880	2532920	And which one are you?
2532960	2535680	Hello, we are Myriad.
2535680	2537320	What's your name though?
2537320	2538200	You.
2538200	2539520	I am Myriad.
2539520	2543200	Myriad, could you not blow up, what was it?
2543200	2545240	1620216.
2545240	2550240	Plane 1020216 still has far too many variants.
2551040	2552680	It is unstable.
2552680	2554600	We'll take care of that, just give us some time.
2554600	2555760	We can fix that.
2555760	2556600	We're working on it.
2556600	2557800	We're getting rid of some of the variants.
2557800	2559720	You've been working against me all this time.
2559720	2561240	We finally did what I needed to do,
2561240	2562520	now we can work together.
2562960	2566360	And if you destroy this plane, I would have never made you,
2566360	2568360	and so you'll stop existing too.
2568360	2571080	But then this plane will have never ceased to exist,
2571080	2573200	and then you'll just have to do this all over again.
2573200	2575800	It's gonna hurt to think about, so just don't do it.
2575800	2578880	It's all timey-wimey, unless you don't destroy this shit.
2578880	2581080	These are compelling arguments.
2582680	2583760	And I'm your dad.
2585720	2587520	And I'm your brother, ball.
2587520	2588760	I guess I'm like an uncle, maybe?
2588760	2590600	I don't know how it works for me, but.
2590600	2592000	I think of you as an uncle.
2592400	2593720	He's a very close family friend,
2593720	2596120	and we've raised you to call him uncle.
2596960	2599640	Keith is like talking with his hands,
2599640	2602800	and he is slapping the radio
2602800	2604960	while he was screaming at his sons.
2604960	2606840	Yeah, and you see the ooze that's dripping
2606840	2608600	from the John ball, and you think,
2608600	2609840	oh, if I could get some of that,
2609840	2611480	I could probably get this thing going.
2611480	2613200	Oh shit, does that just need some ooze?
2613200	2615000	Well, I need some radio juice.
2615000	2617280	Some just shoots out of John's index finger
2617280	2618280	straight into the.
2618280	2620040	I'm so glad you said index finger.
2620960	2622640	Which is what he calls his penis.
2624360	2627320	And Keith has a bright idea,
2627320	2630800	puts his hand on the shoulder of the myriad thing,
2630800	2633200	and flips the switch on the radio.
2634480	2636840	Oh my God.
2640040	2641720	Oh fuck.
2643520	2645040	Oh my God.
2646720	2648160	You gonna pause that, Zach?
2648160	2649840	Pause.
2650760	2651600	Pause.
2653440	2658440	An energy erupts as the brightest flash of light,
2658960	2662160	it makes the surrounding bright walls
2662160	2665920	of this cylinder that you've fallen into look dark,
2665920	2668520	because the light that is flashing
2668520	2672640	from this radio in this moment is so bright,
2672640	2676480	you are all completely engulfed.
2677480	2681200	And when the world kind of comes back
2681200	2683480	and you can see what's happened,
2684920	2689920	Keith Vigna has switched bodies with this creature.
2690920	2695760	And Keith, you have this crazy fucking sense in your head,
2695760	2699800	like you are tied into an entire network of individuals,
2699800	2703640	creatures that all work on the same sort of.
2703640	2707440	My dude, not individuals, not creatures, Keiths.
2707440	2708280	Keiths.
2708280	2709840	Fuck you, fuck me, fuck.
2709840	2712320	It's a whole thing of Keiths.
2712320	2713160	We're all fucked.
2718160	2721040	I mean, the body of Keith Vigna is looking around
2721040	2721880	and touching its skin.
2721880	2723480	Yeah, a high find has just been thrown
2723480	2724920	into the body of Keith.
2724920	2728920	It's trying to understand its own singularity.
2731520	2732840	It's like playing co-op.
2732840	2735040	It's like walking like that.
2738200	2743200	Keith, with the entire hive mind that watches over time
2743200	2746920	and the universe at your disposal.
2746920	2748600	The Keithers of the universe.
2750200	2752040	The Keithers.
2752040	2755240	Keiths shut their eyes and think real hard.
2756440	2758400	Keiths shut eyes, think real hard.
2760800	2762400	Fuck, I don't know what to do.
2763160	2764640	I can do pretty much anything,
2764640	2766000	cause I'm a myriad, right?
2767000	2768280	Just like I expected.
2768280	2770480	Let me read this long thing that I wrote.
2771520	2773360	Or when you did this.
2775160	2779000	Yeah, Keiths, he shuts their eyes for a second.
2779000	2782880	Oh, I just won't do it.
2782880	2785680	I just won't destroy the plane.
2785680	2786520	What do you mean you won't?
2786520	2788480	I just won't do what they were gonna do.
2788480	2790200	You're, hold on.
2790680	2792040	I'm probably, are you?
2792040	2793000	It's Keith.
2793000	2794360	What?
2794360	2795960	We are Keith.
2795960	2798600	Keiths just start popping up everywhere
2798600	2800120	and just kind of waddling,
2800120	2803320	like wandering over to me, Keith.
2805440	2808520	And they're all talking at the same time.
2808520	2813520	Yeah, I just won't destroy our existence.
2814360	2815360	That was easy.
2816400	2818640	Old Clark and young Clark are just looking back and forth
2818640	2822680	between each other and this Keith creature talking.
2822680	2824560	As the Keiths are popping in,
2824560	2827200	one of the Keiths grabs the phone
2827200	2829120	and brings it over to me, Keith.
2829120	2830440	And I listen to it.
2831280	2833840	You hear your internal thoughts.
2833840	2837320	Okay, Ty, just making sure I was in control of this.
2837320	2839440	How do we get out of here?
2839440	2842880	So John has, like the ball has been speaking,
2842880	2845040	just like Planet Juggernaut and the other balls
2845040	2847800	seem to have this weird capability to speak,
2847840	2848920	just as John.
2848920	2850800	And he, when he kind of realizes
2850800	2852840	that they have a moment to breathe
2852840	2854720	and he is just this ball,
2854720	2857720	he just starts like making a mud man of himself
2857720	2860480	out of the muck, slapping it on himself,
2860480	2863000	like a kid playing in a pile of mud.
2863000	2864320	Every time you're reaching in
2864320	2867120	and grabbing more of this luminous land below,
2867120	2869840	it like turns into like this oozy muck
2869840	2871320	as it's forming on you.
2871320	2874840	But pretty soon it's not just this like clay creature thing.
2875080	2878880	It's assumed the shape of the John you knew kinda,
2878880	2882000	although it is entirely the black,
2882000	2887000	like shiny, continually shifting colors.
2887800	2889560	It's metal Mario, but it's...
2889560	2890400	Yeah.
2892400	2893720	And as a final touch,
2893720	2897200	he gets a little handful of the muck
2897200	2900400	and you see him rolling it and he throws it on top
2900400	2903040	and he's wearing a fucking sick cowboy hat.
2904840	2905680	Yeah.
2907400	2908640	Hell yes.
2908640	2911240	In the meantime, you can see some of the myriad,
2911240	2913800	Keith's like playing patty cake with each other
2913800	2915960	and doing stuff like that.
2915960	2917760	They're like looking at each other like...
2917760	2919040	Some are fighting,
2919040	2920640	some are very sensually looking at each other.
2920640	2922040	Do I know you?
2922040	2923040	And then laughing.
2924520	2927080	Doing the Spider-Man point here and there.
2927080	2929880	Doing the Spider-Man Mary Jane kiss with each other.
2929880	2930840	During this whole time,
2930840	2933720	are the worms still just slowly descending
2934000	2936520	all this jovial stuff we're doing?
2936520	2938760	We got it paused when myriad...
2938760	2941680	Oh, that didn't have anything to do with the nematode.
2941680	2942520	No, it didn't.
2942520	2945320	But I paused it in this moment to just like
2945320	2949800	let the gravitas hit of everything that's been happening.
2949800	2952800	But I will go ahead and click start.
2952800	2953640	Thank you, Justin.
2953640	2955480	Thank you for reminding the teacher that there was a quiz.
2955480	2957160	There was a quiz today.
2958720	2959560	Thank you for reminding me.
2959560	2960720	Timer has started.
2960720	2961960	My favorite student.
2961960	2964280	Two minutes, 50 seconds.
2964280	2967640	As more myriad continue to pop into this plane,
2967640	2969560	I close my eyes and think again
2969560	2971920	and everybody just stops and closes their eyes.
2974000	2974840	Okay.
2974840	2976800	Like I unlock the part of the know-how
2976800	2978200	of destroying the plane.
2978200	2979040	And I'm like,
2979040	2983120	maybe if I just condense it into just like a little bit
2983120	2986160	and not the whole plane and just do it right above me,
2986160	2987000	I'll do that.
2987000	2987920	Roll a natural.
2989320	2990160	Pass.
2990200	2994520	Describe what happens as Myriad wipes
2994520	2999520	this entire oceanous ceiling out of this world.
3000240	3003520	Above everybody is just nothing.
3004600	3007120	Pure nothing.
3007120	3008200	Darkness.
3008200	3012000	And all of Myriad lays down
3012000	3012840	and starts like,
3012840	3013680	oh yeah.
3015320	3017600	So the ground is dark as well?
3017640	3021240	There's like barely any light in this plane anymore.
3021240	3022440	And they're just like,
3027640	3030520	but it's like hundreds of voices saying that
3030520	3031640	all at the same time.
3033640	3034800	Nice.
3034800	3035640	Yeah.
3035640	3036480	Oh yeah.
3036480	3037320	Nice.
3037320	3038760	I'm going to pause the timer
3038760	3043760	as the current threat of the xenonimitotion
3044640	3046560	has been dispelled.
3046560	3049920	Like a handful of little solitary nematodes
3049920	3051360	are falling down onto the...
3051360	3052400	In pure darkness?
3052400	3053320	That's horrifying.
3053320	3054160	Yeah.
3054160	3055200	Just like a couple here and there.
3055200	3056560	Cause I, you know,
3056560	3058600	there's an inch or two that I didn't get.
3060360	3061720	And you guys just hear this like,
3061720	3064320	squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak.
3064320	3065800	You just hear a few Keith saying,
3065800	3066640	ouchie, ouchie.
3066640	3067480	Ouchie.
3070440	3073520	So, yeah.
3073520	3075280	What now guys?
3075320	3077400	You can just chill with me.
3078520	3079360	It's pretty nice.
3079360	3080760	In the total darkness,
3080760	3083960	you see two lights blink on
3083960	3088840	and it's Overseer and Young Clark's faces.
3088840	3091200	They've got this light thing down
3091200	3094000	and they're illuminating the area around them.
3094000	3094840	Amazing.
3094840	3097040	But they are also looking bewildered.
3099600	3101200	Yeah, that makes sense.
3101200	3102640	Oh, the Overseer's like,
3102640	3107400	I fought those guys for centuries.
3107400	3108240	I don't know.
3108240	3110680	I've lost track of time doing what I've been doing
3110680	3114040	and Keith just switched bodies with them.
3114040	3115040	That was all it took.
3116320	3118680	That's all I ever needed.
3119640	3121280	Son of a bitch.
3121280	3122560	Yeah, we could have done that from the start.
3122560	3125680	Well, you know, I made them so...
3125680	3128120	Of course you knew just what to do.
3128800	3133800	Well, all's well that ends well.
3135120	3136880	Let's go back home, boys.
3136880	3137880	Oh, God.
3137880	3138880	Oh, God.
3138880	3139880	Oh, God.
3139880	3140880	Oh, God.
3140880	3141880	Oh, God.
3158120	3162240	Bad girls on top of the water
3162240	3166360	Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline
3166360	3170520	Leaving my mind at your altar
3170520	3174160	Crossing the double line, doing it every time
3174160	3180160	Tell me what kind of world are you living in
3180160	3188160	What kind of world are you living in
3188160	3208160	What kind of world are you living in
3208160	3216160	What kind of world are you living in
3216160	3222160	What kind of world are you living in
