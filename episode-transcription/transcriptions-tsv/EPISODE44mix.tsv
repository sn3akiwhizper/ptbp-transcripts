0	6720	What is up my dumpster dwelling hot dogs, it's your new home wolf the dog and I am here
6720	13520	to slather y'all in various sauces while giving you the pleasure to hear my soothing voice
13520	17980	before being digested into the endless void that is wolf's tummy.
17980	26420	Oh and also we are hitting your eardrums live from 694.2 PTBP.
26420	32120	This week's howlin with wolf comes from Mr. Sean Bailey who tagged at pretending pod on
32120	33120	twitter.
33120	37500	You should do that too my hot dogs, they write.
37500	44100	Greetings and salutations wolf, long time listener, first time shout out her.
44100	50580	I need to give props to my former ninja partner Carol R. Without her I would not have blessed
50580	57300	my ears with the sweet sounds of 694.2 and the boys of the contention PD.
57300	61700	So thanks for that, anywho keep on howlin my dog.
61700	69100	Well Mr. Sean I'm happy to hear you've been enjoying the show but please wolf is no person's
69100	75420	dog and I don't howl on command for any person who just tells me to.
75420	79700	Not unless there's a dumpster full of sweet meat in it for me baby.
79700	84040	Remember if you want to write up something for your wolf to howl, tag at pretending pod
84040	89280	on instagram or twitter, tag pretending to be people on facebook, or write a 5 star review
89280	93340	and email us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.
93340	99120	Those iTunes reviews are apparently an absurdly effective way to get our nasty noises into
99120	101960	more strange ear canals.
101960	108700	Also the contest happening over on the subreddit ends at 11.59 PM central time on September
109700	110700	23rd.
110700	115380	All entries have a shot at winning a D&D 5th edition starter set and the winner will receive
115380	120220	a hardback slip case set of delta green the role playing game.
120220	126260	Check out all the hideously delightful entries on the thread at the subreddit r slash pretending
126260	128260	to be people.
128260	132860	Speaking of the subreddit, a few people there seem to have been paying close attention to
132860	135040	the news.
135040	140960	Last time, Clark unexpectedly shattered the aquarium in an attempt to save John Lee Pettymore
140960	146040	who was trapped underwater by the unnatural forces of Marvin Glass.
146040	150880	The two opened the door to Glass' office, unleashing a relentless surge of water that
150880	156400	caught Keith up in its current before he was lifted out of the drink by Marvin Glass.
156400	161660	The two of them, Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna, stood face to face with the head of the Glass
161660	167300	crime family and he showed them a polaroid picture from the odd camera that depicts the
167300	174140	two of them with Kevin in a world where everything is made out of darkness except the ground
174140	176180	which is made of light.
176180	178620	This is spinning out of control, y'all.
178620	185620	The only thing keeping me steady is the repetition, baby, it is kudzu with no backbone.
191660	204660	I don't want to talk too much up top on this episode.
204660	206500	Yeah, I want to get right into it.
206500	210140	But Thomas isn't here so I figured I'd share something he just said when we were in the
210140	211140	kitchen.
211140	212140	Okay.
212140	217500	We were talking about Ed Kemper and Luke said, how tall was he?
217500	218500	Six foot nine.
218500	219500	And he had an IQ?
219500	220500	Of 145.
220500	223460	And then you said that'd make him a really...
223460	227860	He could have been a really good basketball player and probably taught at MIT.
227860	233180	Yeah, and then Thomas said instead he became the world's greatest skull fucker.
233180	236020	Oh, goodness.
236020	240100	Which is monstrous.
240100	244740	And unfortunately factual.
244740	247860	He should have just sacked up and kill fucked his mom earlier.
247860	248860	Jesus Christ.
248860	252140	That would have saved the lives of a lot of people.
252140	260180	So let's dive into, dive into is an interesting word, is you're all standing on water.
260180	268020	Luke, I don't think I described it to you, but your feet are standing on solid ground.
268020	269640	So you're standing on water.
269640	276420	So that description, I thought maybe there was just like a tiny puddle or no?
276420	281140	No, you were standing on what you think you, what you started trying to swim through when
281140	283420	all that water rushed into the hallway.
283420	284420	Yeah.
284420	291820	You probably got dragged by Marvin Glass, like physically, like up, up, like 40 meters
291820	298420	up on top of the water and now you're standing there and he's just asked you what you know
298420	302740	about this picture.
302740	309260	After I would say a solid 10 to 20 seconds of just complete silence from Keith mouth
309260	310260	agape.
310260	311260	Okay.
311260	312540	Actually, hold up.
312540	314140	Some stuff happened before this.
314140	320300	So Clark, Marvin pulled you down like the way that you moved last time.
320300	327500	As soon as you made it to your final destination there, whip snapping into position, he immediately
327500	333340	snapped and you just went unconscious and during that time when your eyes are open,
333340	339140	you're just standing there, but nothing, nothing is seen from your end from behind your eyes
339140	347220	and Marvin and Rosemary continued to discuss this picture and he's holding it up and he's
347220	355740	looking at it and I just look at him.
355740	361140	It's not, there's something I, you got to send me over there.
361140	369020	You got to send me, I, I don't know how, but we got to figure out something, something
369020	375100	we got to, they continue having this discussion that you're not quite privy to the information
375100	384220	of all of a sudden Marvin perks up something in his lack of facial emotions, still twitches
384220	390140	and he turns and looks up into the corner of the room up to where the elevator in the
390140	399020	room next to his office, far above and far beyond the scale of this room, he sees the
399020	408220	elevator door moving and he immediately holds out his hand and there's a, there's a confused
408220	416740	look on his face when this creature arrives in his palm, his long fingers wrapping around
416740	423420	a softball sized fish head with a human body attached to it that is the size of like a
423420	424420	Barbie doll.
424420	425420	Oh my God.
425420	427420	And it was like, Hey, Hey there, sir.
427420	428420	Hey.
428420	429420	Oh gosh.
429420	430420	I'm just so sorry.
430420	435780	I don't know what happened last time that made, made you sure want to do that, but I,
435780	440700	you know, it was a real interesting place that you sent me to there and, uh, I, I've
440700	445540	never seen anything like it of this short and there was some, uh, feelings inside.
445540	456420	I will say that you survive in that environment this whole time.
456420	458180	And yes, yes, yes, of course.
458180	463420	Well, you know, I, I just, you know, going to go on and go on and find whatever's next,
463420	468220	you know, the next great adventure for old me, you know, now that I'm, uh, finally out
468220	474300	there, you know, you know, got friends now and I've, I've, here I am talking to like
474300	481700	the, I mean, I can't even imagine, you know, it feels like to be, to be me right now.
481700	483220	It's just very nice.
483220	491660	And um, as this conversation is happening, you see, uh, Rosemary just staring down, bearing
491660	502460	down on this strange little fish fella and Harvin says, you know, I, I am looking.
502460	508620	And he kind of looks over at Rosemary and looks back at Peter and he says, I am in need
508620	511420	of a new number two.
511420	515860	And Peter's like, Oh my gosh, a number two.
515860	520740	Is that like, I can't even imagine doing anything of that short of nature.
520740	522300	It's absolutely incredible.
522300	524100	Thank you so much for this opportunity.
524100	531540	I mean, and he looks over at Rosemary, who's just arms crossed, but Marvin's face once
531540	537580	again takes a different shape and it's like he smells or feels some sort of sensation
537580	547340	and immediately his hands move and out from the water come Keith Vigna and this scientist
547340	554940	lady with the, uh, the white, you know, soaking wet lab coat and the, the hair maniacally
554940	558620	going on on top of her head and the goggles.
558620	564700	And as soon as she sees Peter Dieter, she's extremely, extremely happy to see him.
564700	570260	And Keith, you looking around this room, you're not standing on this water, like I said, and
570260	572460	you see these odd people.
572460	574780	I mean, the situation is very strange.
574780	576540	You've got Rosemary in this room.
576540	580020	You've got Marvin Glass next to her behind his desk.
580020	586220	You're next to Clark Bishop who is just now seeing you and opening like his eyes to the
586220	588260	world.
588260	594300	And you also see in like Marvin Glass's hand or maybe on the desk now is Peter Dieter sitting
594300	595300	down there.
595300	598380	And I said, Peter, I'm glad you're all right.
598380	601620	I am glad that you're all right too.
601620	607100	After the last time in our meeting, I thought, oh gosh, there's absolutely no way that he's
607100	609420	going to make it much more than one episode.
609420	615740	Like no doubt about it, what's your language?
615740	620540	And Marvin reaches out and shuts down Peter Dieter.
620540	627340	Peter Dieter just stares these wide eyes, these wide fish eyes and this tight lipped
627340	628660	human mouth.
628700	631940	And I need the both of you to roll a power check for me.
631940	632940	Hmm.
632940	637020	A fail, 60 on a 50.
637020	642420	I also fail a 79 on a 60.
642420	649100	I rolled a 42, which is a success against you and therefore when Marvin Glass asks you
649100	657900	a second time what you know about this picture, you have to tell him like a compulsion inside
657900	658900	of you.
658900	664940	You must tell him, okay, Joe doesn't quite remember to tell me what I would know about
664940	665940	it.
665940	670340	I mean, it's, it reminds me of the place that I was with Maggie, correct?
670340	671340	Totally.
671340	672340	Okay.
672340	673340	Other than that, I don't know.
673340	674860	It also reminds you of the other picture, right?
674860	675860	Right.
675860	676860	That's what I was going to say.
676860	677860	Oh sure.
677860	678860	That we know where these come from.
678860	679860	Yeah.
679860	680860	Gotcha.
680860	681860	Okay.
681860	682860	Yeah.
682860	683860	I'll tell him, Oh, they're there.
683860	684860	Um, it's that camera there.
684860	686700	And I point at it cause it's sitting on the desk.
687100	690220	You take a photo and it shows you things that aren't there.
690220	692580	And uh, I don't, I don't know.
692580	694040	I don't know anymore.
694040	699860	We thought they were maybe from a different dimension or from the past or something.
699860	703100	How many pictures did you take?
703100	708500	I turned to Keith, two or three.
708500	714680	There was one with all the people with the torches and the old timey, uh, clothing in
714680	717360	front of blackness, like a black building.
717360	727200	And then there was another one of, uh, like a cowboy, like with his hand up to the camera
727200	730520	and a guy with tribal tattoos kneeling in front of him or something like that.
730520	732120	Say that again.
732120	734360	A man with tribal tattoos?
734360	737320	I believe I recollect that.
737320	744480	And a man dressed as a cowboy or with a cowboy hat looking almost as if he's trying to block
744920	746600	his face from the camera.
746600	750360	You also said the name John Peters.
750360	752720	We saw there was one with him in stocks, wasn't there?
752720	756000	Yeah, that was, I think that was the first one, one of the first ones we took.
756000	760960	And did, did he have fool branded on his forehead?
760960	761960	I think it was in that picture.
761960	762960	Yeah.
762960	768200	And in all of them, that's, it's just like a black inky background.
768200	773440	As you guys are having this conversation there, when, when you guys say that one of them has
773440	782600	tribal tattoos, Rosemary perks up and you notice, and as you're finishing this conversation,
782600	788080	you see she is eyeing the gun so hard.
788080	790120	The tube gun on the desk?
790120	791120	On the desk.
791120	793560	And I like handouts a lot.
793560	799040	I think I've given you guys a lot of handouts over, uh, over the years that we've been playing,
799040	803240	but this is an audio format and handouts don't always work.
803240	808880	And the way I typically use handouts is I hold them until you guys do something that
808880	811240	would unlock the handout, right?
811240	814480	In this instance, you have unlocked a cut scene.
814480	815480	Okay.
815480	816480	Whoa.
816480	821080	I don't play video games, but this is a, uh, I didn't mean to sound so assholeish when
821080	822480	I said that.
822480	827960	I don't play video games, I live them.
827960	836220	I don't waste time on frivolity, like desperately wish I had time for video games, but I work
836220	839020	and go to school and produce this podcast.
839020	841140	Fuck me.
841140	844680	One day I'll play video games, but anyway, this is an audio cut scene of what happens
844680	845680	next.
845680	846680	Ooh, nice.
846680	856120	Rosemary dives for the gun and as she grabs it, Marvin reaches down and flings the sphere
856120	859360	off of the desk at her.
859360	864880	Multiple shiny limbs extend from this small metal sphere and slam into the desk and the
864880	872440	water below, giving it the leverage it needs to fling its silver round frame at its target,
872440	874240	Rosemary.
874240	880320	One of its appendages slices into the soft tissue on the back of Rosemary's neck.
880320	886520	Mother snaps her head forward and you hear the fracture as a third metal tendril reaches
886520	894520	in gripping the top of Rosemary's spine where it meets her head and it rips her entire spinal
894520	902560	cord out of her body in one swift motion, promptly forcing itself into the now vacant
902560	906120	spinal column of this human being.
906120	913540	The new Rosemary standing before you has a crazed look in her eyes as she blows her
913540	921560	nose into her hand, slams the mucus into the empty chamber of this weird gun, and squeezes
921560	925080	the trigger on the odd looking revolver.
925080	930440	There is an almost blinding flash of light that illuminates your entire field of vision
930440	938000	and then, as if she had never been, the body of Rosemary is gone.
938000	940480	I need you both to roll sanity for me.
940480	944560	What the absolute fuck, Zach?
944560	945560	I don't want to play anymore.
945560	946560	I don't want to play anymore.
946560	947560	I quit.
947560	948560	I'm going home.
948560	949560	Oh no.
949560	950560	Oh no.
950560	955560	I was stoked and then I wasn't.
955560	957560	I rolled a hundred.
957560	958560	Yes!
958560	961800	I rolled all the zeros.
961800	963120	I rolled an eighty-two.
963120	964120	What was this on?
964120	965120	A sanity check?
965120	966120	A sanity check.
966120	967120	I rolled over my power with an eighty-two.
967120	968240	All right.
968240	970720	This is very fun, guys.
970720	972160	This is very fun indeed.
972160	976000	So basically, I have this set up in scenarios that you write.
976000	977000	Oh yeah, hit me with it.
977000	978000	Real fast.
978000	979000	She shot the gun.
979000	980720	Was she aiming at anything?
980720	981720	Nope.
981720	984000	So like where was the muzzle pointed when it went off?
984000	985840	As soon as she grabbed it.
985840	986840	So it just like...
986840	987840	Just pulled the trigger.
988120	991800	Yeah, it was just like aiming at the back of the room or whatever.
991800	997040	So when you write a scenario for Delta Green you write in these things that can happen
997040	1003000	and when the PCs come across them or see them you write like roll sanity and then you write
1003000	1007980	how many sanity you take and a lot of them are zero slash one which means if you pass
1007980	1011800	you take zero sanity damage, if you fail you take one sanity damage, right?
1011800	1016100	But then other ones are like one slash one d6 or you know whatever.
1016100	1020500	This one is one d3 slash one d3 plus four.
1020500	1021500	Oh my god.
1021500	1022500	Oh no.
1022500	1030740	So, Joe, you're gonna roll a d6 and halve it and then add four to it instead of just
1030740	1031740	a d3.
1031740	1032740	Do you have a d3?
1032740	1033740	No, you're right.
1033740	1034740	I was about to roll a d4.
1034740	1035740	Oh wait, yeah.
1035740	1036740	I was thinking a d4, yeah.
1036740	1037740	You can roll a d4 if you want.
1037740	1038740	It's like triangle, three.
1038740	1040540	You can roll a d4.
1040540	1041540	So I rolled a four.
1041540	1045340	Okay, so that's two plus four is six so you lose six sanity.
1045780	1047420	What am I gonna do?
1047420	1051400	You automatically take the highest amount of sanity damage so you're gonna take seven
1051400	1052400	sanity loss.
1052400	1055740	Okay, that puts me at negative one.
1055740	1061820	Okay, Joe, where's that put Clark?
1061820	1064260	That puts Clark at sanity seven.
1064260	1066540	He still has a breaking point at six.
1066540	1067540	Oh shit.
1067540	1073580	So I'm fine, I'm just crazier.
1073580	1074860	Oh my god.
1075380	1081300	So, Luke, at negative one sanity, you really can't go negative, it's just zero.
1081300	1085860	So typically in Delta Green you would lose complete control of your character, however
1085860	1092360	I trust in you to be able to play a fully insane PC that I'm gonna let you hold onto
1092360	1100460	that character and do whatever you want with him as he completely loses his fucking mind.
1100460	1106040	Because we're in the endgame here, there's no point in having you bring in a new character
1106040	1108940	when we can just make this one fucking nuts.
1108940	1111760	Okay, I can do that.
1111760	1116660	So you're going to always be in your most negative state.
1116660	1123080	So you're gonna roll a negative 20 on everything and you are going to automatically fail sanity
1123080	1129860	checks and you are going to always- Or automatically succeed them all.
1129860	1133900	Yeah, basically, because everything is real, everything is good to you, whatever.
1133900	1139460	And you also have that thing that happens when you roll sanity over your power.
1139460	1140460	Yeah.
1140460	1142340	You're gonna be that all the time.
1142340	1143340	Okay.
1143340	1144340	Yeah.
1144340	1145340	So here we are in this room.
1145340	1146340	Give me one moment.
1146340	1147340	Sure.
1147340	1148340	I gotta look up what that is again.
1148340	1152980	Joe, just take off your headphones real quick and plug them ears.
1152980	1156380	So it's that you get extremely paranoid.
1156380	1157700	Okay, yeah.
1157700	1158700	Yeah.
1159020	1164660	Do you also want me to constantly be thinking, well, because I already think that I'm possessed
1164660	1165660	by a demon.
1165660	1166660	Oh, yeah.
1166660	1167660	You're going to constantly.
1167660	1168940	That's going to be a big part of it.
1168940	1169940	Yeah.
1169940	1170940	So that and be super paranoid?
1170940	1171940	Uh-huh.
1171940	1172940	Yeah.
1172940	1173940	Sweet.
1173940	1175940	Okay, Joe.
1175940	1177640	So here we are.
1177640	1181300	As soon as that happens, the light flashes and you-
1181300	1184040	Oh, fuck.
1184080	1192280	His Marvin Glass loses his fucking mind and then he reaches out and he holds on to everyone.
1192280	1197600	He is straining himself to do this and he is just holding you all.
1197600	1205920	You cannot move a muscle and then you feel as he kind of waggles his lack of eyebrows,
1205920	1213000	you feel your jaws begin to unclench and your tongues begin to become loose and he rolls
1213000	1222280	over his power check from earlier and says, tell me what just happened.
1225640	1234480	I saw that gun one time before and it did the flash thing.
1234480	1235480	I don't know.
1235480	1236480	I don't know.
1236480	1241720	You both failed your sanity checks and so you see the ground above the water where Rose
1241720	1248840	Mary or the body of Rose Mary just stood, all this black shiny viscous sludge that's
1248840	1255840	down there and seemingly inside all this muck is the placid body of Rose Mary.
1255840	1262680	She is lying peacefully as her limbs seem to fold into this ooze, becoming one with
1262680	1271340	the sentient mass of goop that is now sliding across the water and Marvin Glass reaches
1271340	1278660	out at one of his hands and grabs it and flings it downward into the water below and
1278660	1284120	you hear this noise that you have yet to hear.
1284120	1290460	It's basically like, you know, like there's a certain kind of kitchen top, like a stove
1290460	1295140	top kind of thing that when you turn it on, if it's like kind of broken, the noise that
1295140	1297520	it makes gets inside of your head.
1297680	1301560	You can feel it a little bit in your throat and like inside of your body.
1301560	1302940	Do you guys have that ever?
1302940	1306520	I've only had gas burners, so I'm not sure.
1306520	1310920	I know that I was thinking you were like that, right, right, right, right.
1310920	1311920	We used to have this.
1311920	1318440	We used to have this broken one in the kitchen I worked in and when it came on, it made my
1318440	1321880	throat tingle and it was just like a super high pitched noise.
1321880	1325840	It was just this frequency that would break me as a person.
1326840	1329360	You also do have the weird styrofoam thing.
1329360	1331360	Oh, fucking don't say it.
1334360	1337020	So it could be that, but I know kind of what you mean.
1337020	1338520	I can imagine that.
1338520	1343960	So that is the noise that you feel as he flings this into the water below.
1343960	1345800	I used to get that with tube TVs.
1345800	1346800	Is that what you're talking about?
1346800	1347800	Yes, absolutely.
1347800	1348800	Yeah, I feel you.
1348800	1353320	It's that old fucked up electronic system kind of thing.
1353320	1354320	You can kind of feel.
1354800	1357080	I can feel it in my throat right now as we're talking.
1357080	1358080	Makes me sick.
1358080	1360840	It sounds like it affected you a little more than it affected him.
1360840	1363880	Yeah, it makes me sick, I say.
1363880	1366400	So he threw her body down?
1366400	1368800	No, he threw the tube.
1368800	1375280	After it had already kind of become one and turned into just this massive goop, this sentient
1375280	1378560	mass that was no longer her, you know.
1378560	1379560	All right.
1379560	1384160	As that happens, he looks back up at you.
1385000	1386000	What about that?
1386000	1390160	Have you seen that before?
1390160	1403840	Keith, with just wide eyes, I've only seen that goo one time before at the water park
1403840	1408280	when it decimated two people.
1409280	1412960	I saw it once before.
1412960	1415520	It was seeping out of a picture one time.
1415520	1417000	One that came out of the camera.
1417000	1418000	One of the Polaroids.
1418000	1419000	I saw it once then.
1419000	1422080	I saw it then as well.
1422080	1427200	But at the water park, I think I was the only one of us that was able to see it.
1427200	1430080	Did you see it any other times?
1430080	1433120	Did it take people when you saw it?
1433120	1441320	Do you know how to contain it or is it running rampant through your city?
1441320	1444800	To answer your questions, yeah.
1444800	1446480	We know that it takes people.
1446480	1449840	I don't know that I've exactly seen it firsthand.
1449840	1450840	Maybe I have.
1450840	1453320	I don't remember exactly.
1453320	1459360	There was one time that me and John ran into it and there was a guy who was using a vacuum
1459360	1464120	on it and that seemed to be working until the bag of the vacuum exploded.
1464120	1466160	Who was this man?
1466160	1467160	James.
1467160	1470320	James who?
1470320	1471320	Just James.
1471320	1472880	He worked at the mill.
1472880	1478800	The orifice beneath the two slits that make up his nose kind of gapes.
1478800	1481200	So it's the mill.
1481200	1485360	What do you know about the mill?
1485360	1489040	Am I still under the influence of power?
1489040	1493440	Go ahead and roll.
1493440	1497360	Ooh, okay.
1497360	1499200	He succeeds with a 97.
1499200	1502080	Well, I crit succeed.
1502080	1503080	It's a one.
1503080	1504080	A zero zero.
1504080	1505080	Oh!
1505080	1506080	No!
1506080	1508080	Is that good?
1508080	1516080	No!
1516080	1522120	You can tell him whatever you want and he is very, very convinced that you are telling
1522120	1523120	him the truth.
1523120	1527000	We don't know anything about the mill.
1527000	1528360	We never got out there.
1528360	1529360	Okay.
1529360	1535000	Now tell me, what do you know about these spheres?
1535000	1540600	All I know is what I just saw and what I saw in those videotapes.
1540600	1541600	Go ahead and roll.
1541600	1542600	Oh, actually, just kidding.
1542600	1543600	You just tell him.
1543600	1544600	You're so fucked up right now.
1545120	1546840	Yeah, you just immediately tell him.
1546840	1551440	He says, the videotapes and what else?
1551440	1552440	I turn to Keith.
1552440	1555440	Yeah, what videotape?
1555440	1561600	With the researcher, the professor, whoever she is, I found...
1561600	1568040	Yeah, I just showed him those tapes.
1568040	1569840	He had never seen it.
1569840	1571080	There's a room.
1571080	1574280	There's a room in this building.
1574960	1582320	Anytime somebody touches one of those metal balls, it does what it just did to her and
1582320	1587240	they've got a room covered in blood and there were lots of videotapes.
1587240	1591080	I just saw one of them, but I assume that's what happens every time.
1591080	1601200	That's what she told me every time and I told her, I told her what we did with the silver
1601200	1603280	ball that we had.
1603280	1604880	Which is what?
1604880	1606820	We had a bag.
1606820	1610200	When we put it in the bag, it disappears.
1610200	1614000	What do you mean it disappeared?
1614000	1615160	It was gone.
1615160	1621400	You drop it in the bag and when you reach around in the bag, there's nothing there.
1621400	1622400	There's nothing?
1622400	1624360	Just like out of nowhere?
1624360	1626400	It was just nothing?
1626400	1629200	The little fish fella says from the desk.
1629200	1630200	Yeah, Peter.
1630200	1633080	Whoa, that's amazing.
1633080	1634560	That's so cool.
1634560	1636800	You could just make anything disappear out of nowhere.
1636800	1637800	Well, we didn't.
1637800	1641960	I don't know if we tried it with anything else, but those metal balls disappeared.
1641960	1643260	Balls?
1643260	1644260	How many?
1644260	1646540	I think we just did the one.
1646540	1649320	You've seen more than one?
1649320	1650440	Yeah.
1650440	1652280	How many have you seen?
1652280	1659200	I just think, and I look over at Clark, I just think we had two of them.
1659200	1668600	One was in that woman's head, that disgusting body's head that I think maybe, I think maybe
1668600	1671320	John Lee had that one.
1671320	1682080	He said earlier that they took one of them spears out of this lady's head and that one
1682080	1684840	of them held it in his hands.
1684840	1686480	And Marvin Glass looks up.
1686480	1687880	Is that true?
1687880	1692240	Did your fellow officer hold this spear?
1692240	1693240	Clark nods.
1693240	1694240	Yes.
1694240	1695240	Yes.
1695240	1696240	I saw it.
1696240	1697240	He held it.
1697240	1698240	Where is he now?
1698240	1699240	You don't know?
1699240	1700920	The last time I saw him.
1700920	1703100	Oh, that's right.
1703100	1704740	He died.
1704740	1708740	He was gunned down and ripped apart.
1708740	1710240	Did you know that?
1710240	1711240	Kinda.
1711240	1712240	No.
1712240	1713240	Kinda.
1713240	1714240	Kinda.
1714240	1715240	Not exactly.
1716080	1721880	Now tell me, why was Kevin in this picture with you?
1721880	1724920	You don't, you don't know?
1724920	1737040	John Lee Pettymore, the man who held the spear, he was in Kevin's body.
1737040	1739220	Marvin's eyes widen.
1739220	1741000	So does Clark's.
1741000	1745220	I thought, I thought you, I thought you had something to do with that.
1745220	1757300	You're saying that your coworker on the contention police force is inside of Kevin's body and
1757300	1761420	that he grabbed the metal sphere.
1761420	1763580	That's what you're telling me.
1763580	1768620	Clark, Clark nods again, but while he's nodding, can I look around this room and maybe down
1768620	1772540	in the water beneath us, do I see Kevin's body anywhere?
1772540	1779300	Well you do because Marvin just reaches out a hand and pulls the body of Kevin.
1779300	1787540	And all of a sudden out of nowhere, the wet dead body of Kevin is in his hand in front
1787540	1788580	of you.
1788580	1798820	And with his other hand, he grabs onto the skull of Kevin and twists it open.
1798820	1803460	In a smooth motion, like a perfect avocado.
1803460	1814020	And as he pulls the head of John Lee Kevin Moore apart, sitting inside like the pit in
1814020	1822940	a perfect avocado, you see a small metal sphere.
1822940	1829900	Holy shit, says Joe, says Joe and Clark.
1829900	1832260	Is there viscera or is it, oh yeah.
1832260	1833700	Is his brain in there?
1833700	1834780	His brain was in there.
1834780	1836980	It was like split in half as well.
1836980	1837980	Yeah.
1837980	1838980	And the sphere was like embedded.
1838980	1839980	Embedded in it.
1839980	1840980	Was there a spine?
1840980	1846420	Marvin Glass turns it over to one side so that he can hold the ball like steady with
1846420	1854000	half the skull and then he peels down and just rips the body in half completely dropping
1854000	1860580	the other half into the water and you see where a spinal cord should be, there is nothing
1860580	1861580	there.
1861580	1862580	What?
1862580	1865260	Zach, if you don't fucking stop, I'm quitting.
1865260	1867340	What the fuck?
1867340	1868340	What does that mean?
1868340	1873700	Keith is racking his brain since the cage fight.
1873700	1881300	All the interactions I'd had with Kevin, trying to think of any, I lose no sanity because
1881300	1884300	I don't have any.
1884300	1886420	I don't know.
1886420	1887420	Okay.
1887420	1893620	Well, with this new information, I have a plan for the future.
1893620	1903580	The two of you are on your way to give some heavy entertainment.
1903580	1915900	So if I could answer any questions you may have on your way below ground, meaning death,
1915900	1919620	you can ask them and I will answer.
1919620	1920620	What are those?
1920620	1921740	What are those balls?
1921740	1922740	What are they?
1922740	1923740	What, what are they?
1923740	1933140	Well, as you know, I've been doing research and I have come to very few conclusions, but
1933180	1944420	they are not of this realm and we are working to secure their destruction.
1944420	1946260	Where do you find these?
1946260	1955140	One was brought to me a long time ago by two men that I was seeking out that along with
1955140	1963660	one other person stole something from me, but I got them.
1963660	1966660	I got them all right.
1966660	1977180	And one of them stuck around as my loyal bodyguard for many years, but he brought me my first
1977180	1981060	sphere.
1981060	1984980	And I have been doing research ever since.
1984980	1988660	Was that, that was Kevin.
1988660	1990420	That was Kevin.
1990420	1994420	And he looks at the half body in front of him.
1994420	2000220	But it seems Kevin was compromised.
2000220	2001340	Who was the other man?
2001340	2003220	I do not know.
2003220	2004940	What happened to him?
2005940	2011980	He perished in my need to gain knowledge.
2011980	2020860	You see, when you break a man, oftentimes one of the easiest ways is to break down his
2020860	2024180	ability to communicate.
2024180	2033900	And when someone murders someone that they work with, they often recede into themselves
2033900	2037700	and become malleable.
2037700	2044140	If I forced his hand, I was getting what I needed to get.
2044140	2048140	We're running out of time.
2048140	2051500	You slung that silver sphere at Rosemary when she went for the gun.
2051500	2053780	So you knew it did a thing.
2053780	2058060	It tends to enter the person that it touches.
2058060	2059820	But then she still shot the gun.
2059820	2061060	It didn't work.
2061060	2062060	Is that what you're saying?
2062060	2063460	It didn't do what you thought it was gonna?
2063460	2073140	Well, I maybe did not suspect that the entity inside would do anything other than try to
2073140	2076740	kill itself as it normally does.
2076740	2084180	Do you know anyone with tribal tattoos?
2084180	2087380	That is one of my sons.
2087380	2091220	That is Jermaine Glass.
2091220	2093220	Cool.
2093220	2099020	I had a feeling.
2099020	2107940	He seems to be wherever it is that this camera and perhaps this gun are connected to.
2107940	2116380	Have you any more information about this place, this other world?
2116380	2118420	I have a little power for me.
2118420	2123420	You son of a bitch.
2123420	2125700	I pass 34 on 50.
2125700	2129180	I pass a 45 on a 60.
2129180	2137380	I pass a 72 on a 120.
2137380	2140580	So the only way to beat Marvin is with a crit?
2140580	2143940	Yeah, or you can roll over him and still succeed.
2143940	2149780	If he rolled low enough earlier, I was like, how do you roll over 120?
2149780	2152100	So I need you to answer that question.
2152100	2155420	What do you know about the world that these take place in?
2155420	2158960	What do you know about this other place?
2158960	2159960	We don't know much.
2159960	2162380	There's two other things like those.
2162380	2165800	There's a radio and there's a helmet.
2165800	2169420	The world of those photos though, it's perplexed us as well.
2169420	2174820	The inky darkness around every figure we've seen reminded us of the goo, but we didn't
2174820	2177300	know what that meant.
2177300	2181100	We had somebody take a look at that one that had a bunch of people in front of a thing
2181100	2188460	and apparently all the clothing was kind of mismatched as far as time periods go.
2188460	2189460	We don't know.
2189460	2190460	We don't know what that meant.
2190460	2199420	You've never seen another place that has the dark sky and the ground that is made of light
2199420	2201620	like in this photo?
2201620	2204620	Uh, yeah.
2204620	2207140	The old photos, we didn't see the ground of light, did we?
2207140	2209360	I think maybe no.
2209360	2210360	I think maybe no.
2210360	2211360	Yeah.
2211360	2212360	I think you've just seen it once.
2212360	2214100	It was just in this particular picture of us.
2214100	2217180	This picture and then Clark Bishop has seen it.
2217180	2219700	Right, right, right.
2220140	2222260	I've seen that place.
2222260	2223260	I've seen where we stand.
2223260	2224260	But I didn't...
2224260	2225260	Go on, boy.
2225260	2226260	Talk.
2226260	2227760	I didn't...
2227760	2231180	We weren't all there and I don't even know if I was there myself.
2231180	2234180	It just was.
2234180	2235980	I saw it.
2235980	2238580	I've seen a place that looks like that before, yes.
2238580	2245440	What were you doing when you were there?
2245440	2248700	I saw something in it.
2248700	2254020	There was a creature in that world there and there were people who were trying to keep
2254020	2260900	it at bay and it scared me so bad that I...
2260900	2261900	That's all I know.
2261900	2264980	I don't know what that place was or what I saw.
2264980	2268540	Do you have any last questions?
2268540	2270540	Why do you want to destroy these?
2270540	2275140	I thought for the longest time maybe you were trying to use them.
2275140	2277500	Use, destroy.
2277500	2282700	When it's competition you can do either one.
2282700	2285620	Who's your competition?
2285620	2296740	Power is my competition and greed is the contest and I will not stop until I have attained
2296740	2303940	control over this domain.
2303940	2304940	Last one.
2304940	2306940	That's good.
2306940	2308940	What are you?
2308940	2313460	Ding, ding, ding.
2313460	2320140	Clark Bishop, I am not from here.
2320140	2328140	I am not one of you, but rather one of many.
2328140	2334420	We are in control and we run things.
2334420	2340180	However, from the bureaucratic standpoint, I was getting bored and ready to go out on
2340180	2342020	my own.
2342020	2351340	The government has so many rules, many of which are easy to be broken, however, I do
2351340	2361740	not take orders kindly and I left them a while ago.
2361740	2368460	And I have been battling Myriad ever since.
2368460	2370900	Myriad?
2370900	2378260	Marvin Glass snaps his fingers and the two of you go unconscious.
2378260	2382620	Oh my God.
2382620	2386340	Oh my God, Zach.
2386340	2388300	Holy shit.
2388300	2392740	You guys wake up in a small, cubic room, an armory.
2392740	2399620	The metal walls on either side of you are covered in every type of weapon, armor, gadget
2399620	2401880	and contraption imaginable.
2401880	2407400	The wall in front of you has a doorway with a set of steps leading up.
2407400	2415060	The wall behind you has a square window with absolute darkness on the other side.
2415060	2416920	What?
2417440	2422680	That's all just guns, stairs, and a window to nothing.
2422680	2423680	And each other?
2423680	2424680	Are we both there?
2424680	2425680	And each other.
2425680	2426680	I check my pockets.
2426680	2429800	Do I still have my gun on me?
2429800	2433080	Well.
2433080	2440440	Here's the thing is that you are reaching for it and Clark Bishop sees this.
2440440	2441440	Do I?
2441440	2442440	I search myself.
2442440	2443440	You have it.
2443440	2444440	Okay.
2444960	2447760	Are you looking for this?
2447760	2449360	And I hold up the tiny powerful gun?
2449360	2457700	I want to knock that out of his hand and head for the closest gun on the wall next to me.
2457700	2464600	You do that and a cage appears in the square window and it's a cage that you would recognize.
2464600	2472160	It's the cage that you've been in before and inside this cage is a man so massive that
2472160	2478080	he barely fits and his muscles bulge and press against the inside of his cage and Oz
2478080	2482400	Mayhem Wolf squeezes himself out and into this room.
2482400	2483400	Hello.
2483400	2484960	I see that we are.
2484960	2485960	Oh fuck.
2485960	2487960	I was just in Marvin.
2487960	2489920	I was inside him.
2489920	2490920	Hello everyone.
2490920	2491920	Yes.
2491920	2492920	Here's where I am.
2492920	2501820	I am Oz Mayhem Wolf Oz Mayhem Wolf and I am here to I guess we are all fighting together.
2501820	2507260	He runs excitedly to go grab his stuff and he grabs a pair of boots and some shoulder
2507260	2514260	pads a football helmet and a pair of gloves and he he's all jazzed up and he's putting
2514260	2518140	on all this stuff and he heads over to the stairwell excitedly.
2518140	2523180	I call after him what what do you mean are we fighting each other or are we fighting
2523180	2524180	something else together?
2524180	2525180	I don't what's going on?
2525180	2530780	I think we are going to fight as a group but you guys better prepare because time is running
2530780	2533260	out and a timer begins counting down.
2533260	2535260	What are we what are we gonna fight though?
2535260	2542860	As the timer starts counting down water begins filling up this room from your feet up and
2542860	2544940	you need to start grabbing stuff.
2544940	2546140	I start grabbing stuff.
2546140	2551060	I want you to come up with whatever you grab in between now and our next session.
2551060	2555740	I'm going to give you a full week to decide what you're bringing with you.
2555740	2556740	Wow.
2556740	2557740	Okay.
2557740	2560700	You can have pretty much fucking anything.
2560700	2565860	You can have any sort of armor any sort of gadget any sort of weapon anything like that.
2565860	2569460	Is there any chance that Oz looks back and says what we're going to be fighting?
2569460	2576020	No of course not because that would be no fun whatsoever but I will say that a circle
2576020	2580980	opens up in the ceiling above you at the top of the stairs as you guys all grab everything
2580980	2586540	that you brought with you and head up the stairs and a disorienting amount of light
2586540	2592620	and sound pours in and you hear violently chanted by an unseen crowd.
2592620	2603580	Play Jugga Jugga Play Jugga Jugga Play Jugga Jugga Play Jugga Jugga Play Jugga Jugga Jugga
2603580	2611540	Oh my goodness I cannot wait to be brainstorming oh my god I've been waiting a year for this
2611540	2616460	holy shit dude what the fuck I'm like so stoked wait so we
2616460	2620980	when we woke up in this room did we feel anything in what way if we lost consciousness
2620980	2625740	did we wake up like it's weird you've actually been healed up to full health for some reason
2625740	2630020	well that's not what I meant but that's fucking awesome I kind of meant that I like like did
2630020	2635540	we feel like we had been like knocked out or whatever yeah like some sort of some sort
2635540	2642140	of immediate sleep like you just became in this other place you just came all over it
2642340	2646540	did we did we really get all the hit points back yes you're fully healed and ready to go
2646540	2654180	as Keith hears this the screams from the crowd I look at Clark and say planet juggernaut I
2654180	2662540	barely knew her not we got to pull the comedy tag off this
2672860	2683300	so we've been playing a closed game which means that we leave the room when the PC is not there
2683300	2688940	that way you can keep secrets from each other and stuff however the next episode is going to be
2688940	2696420	this is gonna be kind of apparent so I figured I'd let you guys be in the room for this scene
2696420	2709300	with John Lee Pettymore as we lead out of this episode so John Lee Pettymore in a dark room lit
2709300	2718180	by various electronics and machines we see a massive shiny metal sphere 20 feet tall with
2718180	2725180	silvery arms extending from either side a tube connects this gargantuan ball to a machine below
2725300	2732580	the machine begins whirring and we see a small metal sphere roughly one inch in diameter begin
2732580	2741700	moving up through the tubing into the larger armed version of itself as this happens you
2741700	2750780	John Lee Pettymore feel alive again you feel your consciousness extend itself throughout your new
2750780	2758540	body this colossal monument to destruction a vast circle opens up in the ceiling above you
2758540	2765700	and it's disorienting amount of light and sound pours into this dark room revealing text painted
2765700	2771860	on the back wall that says the same thing you hear violently chanted by an unseen crowd
2780780	2805060	I give my new hands a tentative like punch together kind of dig in what the fuck sorry
2805060	2823620	boys but looks like y'all about to get juggernaut I can't I can't wait to kill
2835060	2845180	try
2865060	2875260	you
