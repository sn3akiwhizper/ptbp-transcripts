0	6400	What is crackin' my babies? Answer, my bones. Constantly.
6400	17900	It's your bone daddy Wolf the dog, here to delight and fright as I hit you with the news both past and present from 694.2 PTBP.
17900	23900	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from at witch.hazels on Instagram,
23900	32000	who created a stellar piece of art depicting Sharon Shadow Berryman, Liz Lonklin, and Judy Krenkelhoff.
32000	35800	Seriously, go check it out. They right.
35800	39500	Hi, Mr. The Dog. Hazel and Pals here.
39500	45100	Sorry we had to send this message by Raven. They're basically rats where we're from.
45100	49100	So why not catch one and convince it to be an errand boy?
49100	53700	Just wanted to thank y'all for consistently putting out amazing content.
53700	56600	The show got me through a hard time this year.
56600	65000	Let's my group of cucks and I share endless laughs and spooks, and inspires us in our own tabletop misadventures.
65000	72300	Mini-cacophonous Howls, Hazel, Alia, Britt, Flynn, Gabby, and Liam.
72300	81000	Haha, please. My father was Mr. The Dog. You can simply call me Wolf... The Dog.
81000	86800	I have an unkindness of ravens constantly circling my general area.
86800	91100	Maybe they can smell the death on me and mine.
91100	93400	But who knows?
93400	98900	I'm glad we can put out something that can fright and excite you simultaneously, Hazel.
98900	105100	Remember, if you want to write up something for your wolf to how, tag at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter,
105100	107400	tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook,
107400	113600	or write a five-star review on iTunes and email us at PretendingPod at Gmail.com.
113600	117300	Fuck Mark Zuckerberg, that insatiable invertebrate.
117300	125100	And the dudes from PretendingToBePeople want me to remind you they are accepting questions for a third Q&A episode.
125100	133000	So, if you have questions for any of the trash bags that make that show, tag at PretendingPod on Twitter or Instagram.
133000	137200	There's also a post in the subreddit where you can comment your questions.
137200	141000	Or email them to PretendingPod at Gmail.com.
141000	148000	Or go all out, record audio of you asking your question and send that so they can use it in the episode.
148000	156200	Similar to the second Q&A episode, this one will be exclusive for our honorary police officers over on Patreon,
156200	160000	who keep this show alive five bucks a month at a time.
160000	167800	Those beautiful people who hold that dirty title currently have access to six exclusive bonus episodes,
167800	170700	and that number is growing each month.
170700	177000	Now, if you want a question answered, but you can't afford that Patreon lifestyle, fear not.
177000	184300	The PTBP crew will answer some of the questions they don't get to in the Q&A session right there on the internet.
184300	186900	Maybe your question will be one of them.
186900	192900	Or maybe you don't give two fucks about the cucks who run amok to chuck this deluxe guck.
192900	198000	In which case, you probably want me to shut the fuck up and deliver the news.
198000	205300	Last time, Judy's body got taken over, Ash freaked out and ran away from the stakeout with the feds,
205300	214100	Ken realized he's in the crawl space under the cabin, Jeremy found a closet of sorts, and Liz Longlin lost a noggin.
214100	216900	Let's get right back into the business.
216900	221100	It's Blue False Indigo with Moondance.
221100	231100	She runs.
231100	237100	Ooh.
237100	243100	The sun.
243100	248100	Is sleeping soon.
249100	254100	She knows.
254100	260100	That the time has come.
260100	282100	To dance beneath the, dance beneath the shadow of the moon.
282100	289100	Ash Hornbeam. It's completely dark outside, and it's pouring down raining.
289100	297100	You are only seeing where your feet are taking you, splashing in all this mud by the moonlight,
297100	303100	and the pretty consistent lightning flashes illuminating everything around you.
303100	308100	You make your way onto the trail and continue running.
308100	319100	And in the distance, you see Judy Krinklehoff, sister, older sister of your friend Ken Krinklehoff, walking toward you.
319100	325100	Judy!
325100	328100	Uh, hi, hi, hi.
328100	329100	What are you doing here?
329100	333100	I was just walking, uh, in the woods, uh, for a walk.
333100	337100	I assume I'm running the opposite way that she's walking.
337100	338100	Yeah.
338100	343100	I grab her by the arm, and, uh, I just hold onto her, and I bring her with me, and I'm like,
343100	345100	We have to get out of here!
345100	347100	I go with him.
347100	349100	Okay. She goes with you.
349100	355100	I start running down the trail. Is this the trail that leads to the campsite?
355100	356100	Yes.
356100	357100	I head towards the campsite.
357100	358100	You arrive at the campsite.
358100	359100	What do I see?
359100	373100	Fire was never made, so it's kind of hard to tell where it is, but you see, getting soaked by the rain are your bags and everyone's gear that was brought into the woods with you.
373100	375100	Do I see the naked man?
375100	379100	No, you do not. The rope that was tied around the tree is no longer there.
379100	387100	As soon as we get to the campsite, I just fall on my knees, and I'm on all fours, gasping for air.
387100	390100	I look at Judy.
390100	394100	Kin fell. Kin fell. Kin fell in a hole? Kin fell in a hole.
394100	397100	Uh, yeah, I can.
397100	402100	That sucks that Kin fell in the hole. That sucks that he fell in the hole.
402100	405100	But it wasn't...
405100	409100	It wasn't a real hole. He just fell through...
409100	412100	He fell through the...
412100	414100	He fell through the earth.
414100	416100	I saw it happen. He just disappeared.
416100	424100	I think that you don't know what you're talking about, and maybe we should find some big rocks to make a shelter to get rid of the rain?
424100	431100	Ash just looks down at his hands covered in dirt and mud and muck and...
431100	437100	You see there's hand sanitizer sitting on the... I don't know if you wanted to use it.
437100	438100	No.
438100	439100	Clean off your hands.
439100	442100	Ash is freaking out, and he doesn't know what to do.
442100	446100	Judy pats him on the back, and then just walks away and starts looking for rocks.
446100	447100	Okay.
447100	453100	When Judy pats Ash on the back, he throws up like a burped child.
461100	470100	As you finish throwing up like the fucking child that you are, you're bent over, just like hands on your knees.
470100	471100	Hands on the ground.
471100	477100	Hands on the ground, knees on the ground, just vomiting, and Judy finds a couple of big rocks.
477100	486100	I find some big rocks. I set them down next to you, and I am looking at them, picking them up, then I'm looking over at Ash.
486100	489100	Then I go back to look for some more rocks, and I'm like,
489100	495100	Ash, maybe you should just sit still for a little while and just try to breathe.
495100	499100	I'm really nervous about you. You seem to be acting really weird.
499100	502100	He sits down cross-legged.
502100	509100	He starts to think about just what he's seen in the past minute and a half, two minutes.
509100	521100	He is torn between going back to where he fled from to go find his friend, but also this is his crush.
521100	537100	So you don't want to leave. I don't want to leave.
537100	540100	Does Judy know you have a crush on her?
540100	541100	No.
541100	552100	So he sits cross-legged, and Ash sits there looking just at his hands, and he's freaking out, and he wants to go back to the cabin, but he waits for Judy.
552100	563100	Okay, so Judy is frantically looking for a rock, and then I walk up behind Ash, and I hit him on the head with a huge rock.
563100	564100	Luke staring at me.
564100	565100	You're trying to hurt me?
565100	566100	Yeah, absolutely.
566100	573100	This is like a gimme because he is not paying attention at all, so just roll damage for me.
573100	576100	So you're going to roll 1d6 for damage.
576100	578100	Okay. I got a six.
578100	582100	How many hit points do you have, Ash Hornbeam?
582100	586100	Two. I started with seven, so that would have basically killed me anyway.
586100	591100	Ash Hornbeam, what are you thinking about as the lights go out?
591100	608100	I'm hit in the head with a rock. I'm kind of spun around to where I fall on my back facing Judy, and the last thought before my lights go out is, every girl I've ever liked has hurt me.
608100	632100	Oh no!
632100	633100	Joe?
633100	634100	Hey.
634100	636100	It's dark, man.
636100	641100	I mean, I guess the flashlight's on now. It's not as dark.
641100	645100	My one clinging to hope. A little light.
645100	651100	And you see the door on the other side. You see these tubes.
651100	653100	I think I put my ear to the door is where we left off.
653100	656100	Joe?
656100	664100	Ken Krenkelhoff has his ear to the door leading up to the inside of this cabin, you would assume.
664100	669100	And you hear, muffled in the distance,
669100	672100	Let's run!
672100	677100	Get the fuck out of here!
677100	682100	Like, through the door, or like from back where I came? From back up the slide?
682100	685100	Just from somewhere in the distance, you can't quite tell.
685100	688100	Shit. Can I tell the voice that was yelling?
688100	690100	It was Jeremy Pettymore.
690100	693100	I figured. I'm going to try to open the door.
693100	697100	You open the door, and you poke your head up.
697100	705100	Very, very cautiously, this whole action is, I'm moving so slowly and so scared that it's imperceptible.
705100	707100	Roll stealth for me.
707100	712100	Okay. Yeah, I'm actually decent.
712100	718100	But I do not pass. A 67 on a 50.
718100	721100	This door just makes a dumb amount of noise.
721100	722100	Damn it.
722100	729100	And it doesn't seem to matter as you get your head up into the room, as the room is empty.
729100	733100	This is not the inside of a cabin.
733100	736100	This is a lab.
736100	737100	Okay.
737100	752100	All around the room, there are these same tubes that are translucent, and filling them all is this black liquid substance that is oozing through the tubes and going down into the floorboards.
752100	765100	And you would see they're coming from these like stations that are long, about like three feet long and two feet wide.
765100	769100	And there are these like coffin-shaped boxes.
769100	771100	Okay. Is the room lit in any way?
771100	777100	It is. It is completely lit by lights.
777100	785100	Just as a normal cabin would be, it's got electric to it and a lot of like white light, like laboratory lighting, right?
785100	786100	Fluorescent?
786100	794100	Yeah. And I think as you get up into the cabin and start looking around, you would also see there is a wooden trunk.
794100	797100	A large wooden trunk up against the wall.
797100	801100	And there is a desk with papers littered all over it.
801100	807100	Other than the desk with papers, is there anything written anywhere? Can I glean any...
807100	813100	Is there maybe a brand on the machines or is there signage on the walls like, wear your lab coat or anything like that?
813100	821100	No signage whatsoever. The only things that are written are really on this desk and then on this bulletin board above the desk.
821100	829100	I'm going to investigate the desk and the bulletin board and just, if I feel, if I feel sufficiently alone, I'm going to take my time.
829100	833100	Uh, okay. I think you likely...
833100	838100	I haven't heard anything since I've been up here that would make me think there's somebody else in this room or...
838100	842100	Go ahead and roll an alertness for me.
842100	845100	I pass a 21 on a 50.
845100	846100	You hear a...
846100	859100	Out the window and looking out the front window of this cabin, you see Liz Lonklin and Jeremy Pettymore on the other side of a moat that is outside this cabin.
859100	862100	Seemingly surrounding it about five feet wide.
862100	869100	And on the other side, Jeremy Pettymore and Liz Lonklin are running and you look over at the exact moment.
870100	873100	Liz Lonklin stops dead in her tracks.
873100	882100	A massive metal claw from a branch on a tree right above her swings down, decapitating her.
882100	884100	Oh no!
884100	892100	And blood just spurts and squirts. Like when you're peeing after you had sex and it just goes everywhere.
892100	893100	Uh huh.
893100	896100	That's the blood coming out of Liz Lonklin's body.
896100	900100	You know how to paint such a picture for me, Zach. Thank you. Thank you so much.
900100	902100	I do it specifically for each person.
907100	908100	Oh fuck.
908100	909100	Real sanity.
909100	912100	Yeah. No problem.
914100	918100	Oh my god, I pass a six on a 29.
918100	923100	Okay. I think you're just going to go with your usual idea, which is...
923100	924100	That didn't happen.
924100	925100	That's not real.
925100	926100	There's no way that happened.
926100	929100	This is some kind of television screen monitor here at this window.
929100	931100	Exactly. To show you a scary thing.
931100	932100	It's trying to scare me.
932100	935100	After that happens, what's Jeremy doing? Where's the last place I've seen you?
935100	938100	He's gone. He dipped. He just kept running.
938100	939100	Oh god.
939100	940100	He just kept running.
940100	941100	Oh my god.
941100	946100	Well, I don't want to go outside where the claw that decapitates people is.
946100	950100	So I'm going to turn around and look at this desk.
950100	953100	So of course, naturally after seeing that, you want to read some papers.
953100	958100	I want to do some accounting to make sure other decimal points are in the right places.
958100	966100	You see the articles of organization for a new business called Cole's Orphanage.
966100	970100	New school under modern etiquette.
970100	971100	Okay.
971100	979100	And all of the other papers are plans for a gun that is being created.
979100	980100	Oh my god.
980100	986100	And looking at the plans, it seems to have been recently completed.
986100	993100	There are also plans for small metal spheres, one inch in diameter.
993100	1002100	And looking at the plans, it seems that they are being put into small human bodies.
1002100	1005100	Yeah, I was going to say that when I see the Cole's Orphanage thing,
1005100	1009100	I take a weary glance at the three feet long coffins.
1009100	1012100	Uh-huh.
1012100	1015100	Oh no. Oh no.
1015100	1018100	Can I go through the drawers of the desk?
1018100	1019100	Sure.
1019100	1021100	I just want to see if I can find anything.
1021100	1026100	I've got my spear still, but I think I'm kind of panicky just looking for anything I can.
1026100	1028100	Okay, roll search for me.
1028100	1035100	And that'll give you a good old, a very interesting piece of information.
1035100	1036100	Fuck.
1036100	1038100	Don't pass. A 97 on a 50.
1038100	1042100	You're in no state to be reading in detail anything, really.
1042100	1046100	You're just looking over these plans in a very broad, vague sense.
1046100	1054100	Okay, going back to survey mode, is this room four walls or is there other places I can go in here?
1054100	1055100	Just four walls.
1055100	1058100	Is there only the front door out of this place?
1058100	1059100	Yes.
1059100	1061100	And it's kind of by the window that I just saw terrible things happen?
1061100	1062100	Yes.
1062100	1063100	Fuck.
1063100	1070100	When you walk over and look at that window, you see that there's also another building within the premises of this moat.
1070100	1071100	Okay.
1071100	1072100	Being surrounded by the moat.
1072100	1079100	And it is smaller than this cabin and the door is open and there's a light coming out of it.
1079100	1080100	Can I see any shadows in the light?
1080100	1083100	You see no shadows in the light.
1083100	1088100	Yeah, I want to, I don't know, I kind of want to look at a coffin.
1088100	1090100	Can I see, does it open in any way?
1090100	1092100	Oh yeah.
1092100	1094100	I want to open it.
1094100	1100100	Wait, if I can see into the coffin at all and there's black goo in the coffin itself, I don't want to open it.
1100100	1103100	But if it's opaque, I guess I'm going to open it.
1103100	1105100	It is opaque.
1105100	1106100	I'm opening it.
1106100	1108100	Go, oh fuck.
1108100	1111100	Roll dexterity.
1111100	1116100	Roll dexterity to see how quickly this happens.
1116100	1118100	I pass a 35 on a 75.
1119100	1127100	You open up this coffin and this black viscous, sludgy, oily goo starts pouring up out of it,
1127100	1131100	all over the table that it's on, and then onto the floor.
1131100	1137100	And you get out of the way just in time to not touch any of this, but it is starting to spread throughout.
1137100	1146100	And as it dissipates out of this coffin, you see that inside the coffin, there is a two-year-old body.
1146100	1148100	Oh no.
1148100	1157100	That is not quite human-looking, as if it is being 3D printed and it is not finished.
1157100	1159100	Oh my god.
1159100	1160100	Wow.
1160100	1164100	So it's like all the edges aren't sharp yet, everything's smooth.
1164100	1170100	So picture a face with a plastic bag over it, that's what this face looks like.
1170100	1172100	I can totally picture it, holy shit.
1172100	1179100	In my haste backwards, do I have time to maybe close the lid so it's not pouring out more?
1179100	1180100	Probably not.
1180100	1181100	Probably not.
1181100	1182100	Okay.
1182100	1184100	Then I am going to run out the front door.
1184100	1188100	And when I say run out the front door, I am panicking running to the front door,
1188100	1193100	but when I get to the door, I want to try and gingerly open and close it behind me.
1193100	1194100	Okay.
1202100	1213100	Jeremy Pettymore, you're running through the woods.
1213100	1220100	Rain is pouring down on you and you're splashing in puddles and mud is splashing up onto your pant legs.
1220100	1224100	And the dark night sky is being lit by the moon.
1224100	1229100	And all these lightning flashes that keep illuminating everything around you.
1229100	1236100	You've seen so much shit tonight that every single time lightning flashes, you think you see something off in the woods.
1236100	1240100	And then eventually you do see a figure walking toward you.
1240100	1245100	And it is Judy Krinklehoff, the older sister of Ken Krinklehoff.
1245100	1247100	Judy, where the fuck did you come from?
1247100	1253100	I was just walking in the woods and I saw you and you're running and your clothes are all cattywampus and I don't know what to do.
1253100	1254100	Cattywampus?
1254100	1255100	Nevermind.
1255100	1256100	Nevermind.
1256100	1260100	Anyway, wait, were you with the girls?
1260100	1262100	No, they ran away and they left me.
1262100	1265100	I was in the shackled by myself and then I had to run and find help.
1265100	1266100	What shack?
1266100	1268100	The shack up at the front by the parking lot.
1268100	1269100	The parking lot?
1269100	1271100	We should go back there.
1271100	1275100	Okay, I'm just really scared so can you just stay really close to me please?
1275100	1276100	I guess.
1276100	1280100	You're like three years older than me and at this point in our life cycles that's like,
1280100	1288100	really, honestly, I feel like you're an adult figure and I'm like, okay, but damn.
1288100	1293100	I know, but like size-wise and body-wise and like how are puberty cycles have been working?
1293100	1300100	Like you are significantly larger than me so if somebody tries to come and get us you could probably kill them first so can you please just go in front?
1300100	1309100	Jeremy has like never heard more overshuring but he's like, okay, and he runs in front of her.
1310100	1312100	And he doesn't look back.
1316100	1319100	Okay, so you're running, I guess, in front of me?
1319100	1320100	Yeah.
1320100	1329100	So I run up behind him and I pull the machete out from behind my shorts and I stab him in the back multiple times.
1329100	1334100	Well, I'd like to avoid that if I could.
1335100	1345100	Jeremy Pettymore, I'm going to need you to roll an alertness at a negative 40 because of the situation you're in to even roll dodge against her.
1345100	1348100	Right, I've got to get below a 10.
1349100	1350100	24.
1350100	1355100	You do not notice and therefore there will be no opposed check here.
1355100	1357100	So are you stabbing?
1357100	1358100	You're stabbing multiple times?
1358100	1359100	Yeah, I'm stabbing.
1359100	1362100	Okay, so we're going to roll melee.
1362100	1363100	What is your melee?
1363100	1364100	You're going to have a bonus.
1364100	1365100	I have a 40.
1365100	1367100	Plus 20.
1367100	1368100	Okay.
1370100	1371100	I got a 66.
1371100	1373100	That is a critical failure.
1373100	1374100	Oh, fuck.
1376100	1378100	I kind of wanted it for her.
1383100	1384100	What the hell?
1384100	1398100	He screams as Judy Krinklehoff goes to stab him in the back, missing desperately and falling forward, tripping on the mud and the rock underneath her and landing directly on the machete face first.
1398100	1422100	As the machete slides its back between a crevice of two rocks on the trail and her face falls directly into it, splitting her skull wide open enough for Jeremy Pettymore to see a small one inch in diameter silver sphere in the middle of her head and black ooze begins gushing and running out from underneath it.
1422100	1424100	Roll Sanity, Thomas.
1424100	1431100	Jeremy Pettymore has no idea what that is, but Thomas Cox is gaining a new understanding of the central mystery.
1433100	1434100	Fucking 19.
1434100	1436100	Jeremy Pettymore is fine.
1438100	1441100	Always has been, always will be.
1441100	1443100	Jeremy Pettymore, what are you going to do?
1443100	1444100	Run.
1446100	1447100	Let me do that when I'm not yawning.
1447100	1449100	Is this game boring?
1449100	1450100	Run.
1453100	1454100	Run.
1456100	1458100	Go fuck yourself.
1459100	1460100	It's late.
1460100	1461100	Late.
1487100	1488100	How did you know my theme song?
1488100	1489100	I never sang it for you.
1489100	1490100	That's awesome.
1490100	1493100	I read your dream journal.
1493100	1500100	Ken Krenkelhoff walks out of the cabin, out of the front door, onto the front porch.
1500100	1504100	You see three figures approaching.
1504100	1506100	It's raining.
1506100	1507100	It's dark.
1507100	1514100	The moonlight is revealing part of them, but then a lightning strike reveals three individuals.
1514100	1517100	They're all wearing black suits with white shirts.
1517100	1521100	Two of them have black ties and one is wearing a bolo tie.
1521100	1524100	Ooh, the cool one.
1524100	1525100	Obviously.
1525100	1529100	The tall one has got buzzed blonde hair.
1529100	1534100	The man with the bolo, shorter, pants pretty tight.
1534100	1536100	He's got a thick mustache.
1536100	1542100	And then the third is a woman and she is smiling.
1542100	1547100	A cold, vacant smile behind asymmetrical bangs.
1547100	1549100	Oh, you fucker.
1549100	1551100	Covering one of her eyes.
1551100	1552100	Oh my god.
1552100	1557100	And they see you and she begins chanting.
1557100	1559100	Where are they in relation to me?
1559100	1561100	Are they inside the moat perimeter?
1561100	1566100	They are just on the other side of the moat, walking toward you pretty slowly.
1566100	1568100	I want to run.
1568100	1570100	I want to get away from that.
1570100	1572100	That's creepy chanting, lady.
1572100	1573100	Roll power.
1573100	1579100	Oh, it's my second worst stat.
1579100	1581100	She rolled a 20.
1581100	1582100	I fail.
1582100	1584100	61 on a 35.
1584100	1589100	As you turn back to go into the cabin, when you reach out to open the door,
1589100	1596100	your hand phases into the door and you feel a slight push behind you.
1596100	1603100	And your body moves toward and into the door of the cabin.
1603100	1611100	Wood fills your body as the thoughts in your mind go out of existence
1611100	1623100	into the door of the cabin, killing Ken Krenkelhoff in an extremely similar way to Clark Bishop's parents.
1623100	1625100	Yep. Holy fuck.
1625100	1637100	Your mind still works for just long enough for you to watch as these three people ransack this cabin.
1638100	1644100	As soon as they come in, one of them starts yelling about the ooze that is all over the floor.
1644100	1651100	Another one grabs a bucket and runs out to the moat, comes back in with a bucket full of water,
1651100	1655100	and splashes it on the ooze, pushing it backward.
1655100	1658100	Two of them grab the trunk and they leave.
1658100	1660100	One of them comes back in.
1660100	1671100	It's the woman, and she starts chanting again, and the entire place begins to light up in flames.
1671100	1678100	Ken Krenkelhoff dies burning as part of the cabin in these contention woods.
1678100	1685100	Jesus God. Oh, that's awful.
1685100	1688100	He was conscious for some of that.
1688100	1690100	Oh, no.
1704100	1706100	Thomas Jeremy Pettymore is fucking running.
1706100	1707100	Yeah, he is.
1707100	1714100	Are you going to stop by your campsite before you bail to grab your bag of things?
1715100	1720100	No, I assume he has the pistol on him, and otherwise he is just fucking booking it.
1720100	1727100	He's seen Ken disappear, Ash is apparently stuck in a tree somewhere that no one could find,
1727100	1732100	so he is just fucking booking it back to the ranger station.
1732100	1737100	Okay, when you make it back to the ranger station, you see there's one light that is shining down,
1737100	1741100	like a streetlight on the parking lot. It's flickering.
1741100	1745100	Rain is torrential downpour at this point. You are completely soaked.
1745100	1752100	You've got some blood on your shoes from where Judy Krenkelhoff fell on that machete,
1752100	1760100	and it splattered out onto you, and it's probably washed off with the mud and the wet at this point,
1760100	1768100	but you see from the moonlight shining down a reflection on all this water that's pouring from the sky,
1768100	1773100	and the lightning strikes are illuminating everything around you.
1773100	1781100	You're all alone in the parking lot, and you see there's the car, the notice on the driver's side window.
1781100	1783100	He's running for the Bronco with the Bronco keys.
1783100	1788100	I forgot you had those. You run to the Bronco, you slam the keys into the ignition,
1788100	1790100	and when you go to turn it over...
1790100	1793100	Give me a roll. You're going to say it doesn't start, right?
1793100	1794100	Yeah.
1794100	1795100	Give me a roll.
1795100	1796100	I'll give you a roll.
1796100	1797100	Okay. I don't know what that should be, but...
1797100	1799100	Oh, driving.
1805100	1809100	Okay, I didn't put anything to drive because I'm a 14-year-old.
1809100	1810100	Yeah.
1810100	1813100	But naturally, on your page, you have a 20% drive.
1813100	1814100	And you rolled?
1814100	1815100	A 27.
1815100	1817100	Oh. Forks.
1817100	1818100	Yeah.
1818100	1819100	Fucks.
1819100	1820100	Spoons.
1820100	1821100	Fucks.
1821100	1822100	So he doesn't know how to start a car.
1822100	1823100	When you go to...
1823100	1824100	It's just dead.
1824100	1826100	There's a point to where something is wrong.
1826100	1831100	Either the battery's dead, like literally no lights are coming on when you turn the car over.
1831100	1834100	I get out of it and I start running down the road towards town.
1834100	1842100	As you're running down the road toward town, trees are on either side of you lining this country road.
1842100	1843100	I'm going to get ashed.
1843100	1848100	They're going over the top of you creating a sort of canopy.
1848100	1852100	And the camera is down low, like on the ground.
1852100	1856100	As you're running off into the distance.
1856100	1865100	And then we see a black sedan driving incredibly furiously come over the top of the camera.
1865100	1868100	And behind it, a four-wheeler.
1868100	1876100	And as they approach, the four-wheeler overtakes the black sedan and rolls up next to you as you're running.
1876100	1881100	And you look over, and riding this four-wheeler is a man.
1881100	1882100	Pretty fit.
1882100	1883100	Early 40s.
1883100	1887100	He's wearing a black suit with a white shirt and a bolo tie.
1887100	1891100	And he has a fucking badass mustache.
1891100	1895100	And you recognize it as John Lee Pettymore the Third.
1895100	1897100	Your second cousin.
1897100	1899100	I wave.
1899100	1901100	I want to hop on the four-wheeler.
1901100	1902100	John!
1902100	1903100	John!
1903100	1904100	Uncle John!
1904100	1905100	Uncle John!
1905100	1907100	He stops the four-wheeler.
1907100	1908100	And he sees you.
1908100	1909100	And his heart sinks.
1909100	1911100	And you can see it in his eyes.
1911100	1912100	Uncle John!
1912100	1914100	Thank God you're here.
1914100	1916100	What's wrong, Uncle John?
1916100	1918100	And he lifts up a pistol.
1918100	1919100	Okay.
1919100	1921100	Puts it to your head.
1921100	1928100	Jeremy Pettymore, 14 years old, closes his eyes tight and is shaking.
1928100	1932100	You feel the gun trembling on the other side as well.
1932100	1934100	And then there's nothing.
1963100	1964100	She knows.
1964100	1965100	She knows.
1965100	1966100	She knows.
1966100	1982100	She knows that the time has come to dance beneath the, dance beneath the shadow of the moon.
1992100	2012100	She moves with the howling wind.
2012100	2024100	The sun, the sun, the sun has come again, come again.
2024100	2035100	Her eyes, her eyes have seen it all.
2035100	2047100	The wonders of, the wonders of the shadow of the moon.
2065100	2076100	Alright, thanks everybody for listening to the Woods of Contention mini-arc of Pretending
2076100	2077100	to Be People.
2077100	2078100	Zach, what's wrong with your voice?
2078100	2081100	Way to crush that mood that they just came out of.
2081100	2086100	They're back in the scrap pit.
2086100	2091100	Justin's not here, but we figured we'd pop on in at the end of this episode.
2091100	2099100	And we recently just said that we would take Q&As for a new Patreon episode that's coming out next month.
2099100	2107100	And we figured we'd pop in here and answer a couple of the quickly asked answers on the subreddit.
2107100	2110100	And we're going to take down a couple of them right now.
2110100	2117100	So, Sky Spore, or Sky's por, or Sky's po ar asks,
2117100	2120100	What do you all do when you're told to leave the room?
2120100	2127100	We kick and scream and say, no Zach, no, no, no, I'm not gonna, I don't wanna.
2127100	2129100	I go and hide in the corner.
2129100	2130100	I don't know what happens.
2130100	2131100	They don't notice me every time.
2131100	2133100	I don't know what happens.
2133100	2137100	I have to grab Thomas by the ankles, but I just have to find Joe.
2137100	2141100	As soon as he's found, he like hangs his head.
2141100	2144100	And it's actually just Joe with his hands over his eyes.
2144100	2146100	Sitting in his chair still.
2146100	2147100	He thinks that's how it works.
2147100	2152100	And in all the commotion, Luke just sits in his chair and nobody really notices.
2152100	2156100	I usually go sit in the kitchen and smell whatever Taylor's cooking.
2156100	2157100	Yeah.
2157100	2159100	Tonight's her meal prep night.
2159100	2161100	It's Zach's wife's meal prep night.
2161100	2164100	So she's always making like dope smells in the kitchen.
2164100	2166100	It currently smells delicious right now.
2166100	2168100	Every time we open the door, it walks in.
2168100	2169100	Some awesome fucking barbecue chicken.
2169100	2174100	She had like barbecue chicken, beets and sweet potato.
2174100	2177100	As opposed to the smells she normally makes.
2177100	2178100	Ew!
2178100	2181100	Yeah, her disgusting farts.
2181100	2188100	She's prepping those right now.
2188100	2191100	That's the bitch I own for.
2191100	2195100	It's pretty annoying because when the weather is nice, I think you guys can go outside,
2195100	2197100	but it's fucking terrible out now.
2197100	2199100	Yeah, it snowed and iced yesterday.
2199100	2202100	Yeah, so the answer is we hang out with Taylor.
2202100	2205100	Just kind of shit amongst ourselves.
2205100	2208100	If there's multiple people back there, we will talk.
2208100	2212100	Beyond being podcast superstars, we're all good friends.
2212100	2216100	So we shoot the shit and hang out because we see each other once a week this way.
2216100	2220100	We don't have to fucking keep up the act on these Q&As.
2220100	2222100	You signed the contract.
2222100	2224100	I don't care.
2224100	2225100	I don't fucking care.
2225100	2228100	There's an ADA that says that you have to like us.
2228100	2229100	Right.
2229100	2232100	Also, we pet the cats, Ramona and Ropo.
2232100	2233100	Oh yeah.
2233100	2234100	Two cats.
2234100	2235100	Nice sweet kitties.
2235100	2237100	Tell them about your not so fat cat now.
2237100	2238100	Well, yeah.
2238100	2239100	How big was she?
2239100	2242100	Ropo was 35 pounds when we got her.
2242100	2245100	So fucking insane.
2245100	2246100	And she's short too.
2246100	2247100	She's really short.
2247100	2248100	She's not a long cat.
2248100	2252100	There are so many breeds of dog where that would be like a problematic weight.
2252100	2256100	Oh, it was extremely problematic.
2256100	2257100	And she was so cute.
2257100	2260100	We had to get her, but I didn't want a diabetic cat.
2260100	2264100	So we've been working out with her every day.
2264100	2266100	She's really toning up her core.
2266100	2271100	We just moved an elliptical machine into a room that Ropo is going to be good at.
2271100	2275100	Honestly, mostly Ramona just chases her around and doesn't let her eat.
2275100	2277100	So that's the diet that she's on.
2277100	2278100	It's really worked.
2278100	2279100	Yeah.
2279100	2280100	What is she now?
2280100	2282100	She is down to 16 pounds.
2282100	2283100	Oh, shit.
2283100	2284100	Really?
2284100	2285100	Wow.
2285100	2286100	Yeah.
2286100	2287100	It's super impressive.
2287100	2292100	However, now she has this flap of skin that just drags the ground everywhere she goes.
2292100	2294100	And she was never pregnant, I don't think.
2294100	2295100	But fun story about Ropo.
2295100	2299100	Her name was Roly Poly when we got her, and they shortened it to Ropo.
2299100	2304100	But she was owned by a woman who took in lots of shelter animals.
2304100	2306100	And when the woman died-
2307100	2310100	And fattened them up to eat them?
2310100	2312100	Fucking clearly.
2312100	2315100	But before she could eat Ropo, she passed away.
2315100	2322100	And when they went into the house, they found I think she had eight cats and 13 dogs or something.
2322100	2326100	And Ropo was hiding in the cabinet under the sink.
2326100	2327100	Aw.
2327100	2330100	Full of old lady face.
2330100	2331100	100%.
2331100	2337100	They had to use special tools to cut the cabinet off to get Ropo out of it.
2342100	2344100	Your cat is so fat.
2344100	2346100	How fat is she?
2346100	2347100	The jaws of life.
2347100	2355100	I did like the first night that we had Ropo, I woke up to her just like chewing on my cheek.
2355100	2358100	And like, I'm not dead yet.
2358100	2364100	We got another question from Room Service Nachos.
2364100	2367100	It says, why is Luke so handsome?
2367100	2373100	As a child, I had to have facial reconstructive surgery because I was too ugly for my parents to love me.
2373100	2376100	But now, look at me.
2376100	2379100	Asked by Luke and answered by Luke.
2379100	2380100	There you go.
2380100	2382100	Don't dox my Reddit account.
2382100	2385100	You doxed your own Reddit account.
2386100	2390100	We've got another question here from, I believe it's Malidori.
2390100	2392100	M-A-L-I-D-O-R-I.
2392100	2395100	It says, howdy everyone. Fellow Missourian here.
2395100	2396100	What up, what up.
2396100	2400100	I hope you're all staying nice and warm with the winter incoming fast.
2400100	2402100	It is coming all over us.
2402100	2407100	Speaking of staying warm, one, what is your all beverages of choice?
2407100	2410100	They've been into Kraken Spiced Rum recently.
2410100	2411100	Fall beverage of choice?
2411100	2414100	I think it's not specifically fall, but...
2414100	2416100	Y'all's beverage of choice.
2416100	2418100	Y'all's fall beverage of choice?
2418100	2421100	Me and Thomas went through the Kraken phase. We used to bring that to parties all the time.
2421100	2422100	I used to buy the little...
2422100	2425100	Yeah, before we were 21.
2425100	2430100	I'm picturing the tiny little shooters with the Kraken on it.
2430100	2433100	We would get the big bottle.
2433100	2441100	Also, that is exactly the viscosity level that I'm thinking when I talk about the ooze in this campaign.
2441100	2443100	Oh, really?
2443100	2450100	Kraken is brutal, and it'll take your life from you.
2450100	2454100	I like hot tea.
2454100	2461100	I've been buying a shitload of that memory lane chocolate milk.
2461100	2463100	That shit is fucking awesome.
2463100	2470100	You buy the gallon of it, and it lasts me three days.
2470100	2471100	Oh, Jesus.
2471100	2472100	Yeah, I drink way too much milk.
2472100	2481100	We actually tried to record last week, but Luke came in, and his mouth was so filmy with chocolate milk that he couldn't talk.
2481100	2485100	I threw up on the table, and we spent the time cleaning it off instead of recording.
2485100	2488100	Whoever sits in that spot just pukes every single time.
2488100	2490100	Oh, yeah, this was Taylor's fault.
2490100	2496100	Dude, that's the fucking craziest thing I've ever seen in real life.
2496100	2497100	Yeah, in real life.
2497100	2502100	This is your wife puking for ten minutes after trying to make herself burp.
2502100	2508100	She thought it was super funny at the time, and then it wasn't really funny immediately.
2508100	2509100	What about you guys?
2509100	2514100	Well, you know, Kristen Schall's horse? It got funny again.
2514100	2519100	I've been trying to force myself to like those seltzer waters, the La Croix type thing.
2519100	2520100	Dude, the bubblies are way better.
2520100	2523100	Because I hate them, but I've got to stop drinking soda.
2523100	2527100	Yeah, bubbly's good and spindrift is good. I've been having good luck with those.
2527100	2531100	What's the one that you said you bought it all or something?
2531100	2532100	Spindrift.
2532100	2538100	Spindrift, yeah. I've cleaned out the grocery store that is near me because nobody else is buying the spindrift there.
2538100	2541100	I just noticed actually the other day they were restocked. So yeah.
2541100	2542100	Lucky.
2542100	2543100	I'm bumping up dim numbers.
2543100	2553100	So I actually am fully moved away from even the flavored seltzer waters to the best choice unflavored original seltzer water.
2553100	2554100	Wow.
2554100	2555100	I just can't do that.
2555100	2556100	That sucks.
2556100	2557100	You can see these two cans right next to me.
2557100	2560100	You could put lime juice in them to make them taste good.
2560100	2561100	I put lime juice and bitters in there.
2561100	2563100	Yeah, there you go. What sort of bitters? Angostura?
2563100	2565100	Angostura. I'm not a monster.
2565100	2566100	Peychaud's.
2566100	2568100	Oh, Peychaud's is dope though.
2568100	2571100	So is that so you don't drink soda and beer?
2571100	2572100	Yes.
2572100	2573100	Okay.
2573100	2574100	Yeah.
2574100	2577100	Because a thing I really like is just water.
2577100	2578100	Yeah.
2578100	2583100	At the point, a thing I don't like is unflavored sparkling water.
2583100	2586100	Oh, I'm such a fan. I also love water. I chug so much water.
2586100	2591100	I drink a lot of water too. I'm trying to replace just the soda that I would also drink.
2591100	2598100	One of my roommates has an affinity for buying tons of bottled water at a time.
2598100	2599100	Oh, that sucks.
2599100	2604100	It does suck, but it also doesn't suck because I drink way more water now and pollute the ocean.
2604100	2605100	There it is.
2605100	2607100	There's the terrible part.
2607100	2611100	I was going to say that I refill my water bottles, but my sister gets mad at me every time.
2611100	2616100	Apparently that's bad for you. I guess it's still carcinogenic or something like that to reuse the water bottles.
2616100	2620100	If you just have it sit in there for like a minute or two.
2620100	2625100	There's also this cream soda that I have been super into recently.
2625100	2626100	Lost Trail?
2626100	2632100	No, it's that shit that I brought over to your house. I don't know. It's fucking good. I'll look it up.
2632100	2637100	So those are the beverages that we like for our choices.
2637100	2640100	Was he talking alcohol though? Or were they talking alcohol though?
2640100	2643100	My go-to if I'm at a bar is High Life and a shot of Fernette.
2643100	2645100	Yeah, Fernette Baraka.
2645100	2646100	For the win.
2646100	2650100	I'm a beer guy in general, but I also always have a bottle of whiskey at the house.
2650100	2657100	I'm fully obsessed with Angostura Amaro. That's my current go-to, especially for fall drinking.
2657100	2661100	Oh man, that with a shot of espresso next to each other? Baby, baby.
2661100	2662100	Nice.
2662100	2663100	Baby, baby.
2663100	2666100	My heart will always belong to Bell's Two-Hearted Ale.
2666100	2668100	I think that's up there with me too.
2668100	2675100	I think the people who follow us on our social media accounts saw your love of Bell's Two-Hearted Ale in a picture recently.
2675100	2681100	I mean, we tag Bell's in a lot of pictures where we're drinking Two-Hearted, but the recent picture from Halloween.
2681100	2682100	Yeah.
2682100	2683100	Pretty great picture.
2683100	2684100	Nice.
2684100	2688100	If any of you have played Disco Elysium, I was a disco cop.
2688100	2690100	And it was a killer costume.
2690100	2699100	Yeah, you only see my bottom layer and the wife beater shirt that I ripped in half.
2699100	2701100	Don't worry, he was proving a point.
2701100	2704100	You did the facial hair though. That's what brought it all together.
2704100	2705100	You look great.
2705100	2710100	It's called Natural Brew Cream Soda for anybody out there liking cream soda.
2710100	2711100	Natural Brew.
2711100	2712100	Natural Brew, dog.
2712100	2725100	All right, so this type of sweet behind the scenes action is what you can expect on our upcoming Q&A episode that'll be for patrons only at our $5 and up level.
2725100	2733100	There are honorary police officers of the Pretending to Be People Patreon, and we are so fucking grateful for them.
2733100	2734100	Thank you.
2734100	2735100	Jesus.
2735100	2736100	Big time.
2736100	2737100	Thank you, babies.
2737100	2738100	Seriously.
2738100	2743100	Don't forget about that and up, by the way.
2743100	2747100	And yeah, I'll say it here, we'll have some new tiers popping up soon.
2747100	2753100	Can we maybe debut the highest level tier that we discussed the other day?
2753100	2754100	The very highest level?
2754100	2756100	Yeah, the very highest level.
2756100	2765100	If you want to support our podcast for $10,000 and buy Zach and I hair plugs, that would be immensely appreciated.
2765100	2767100	It would be super helpful for-
2767100	2768100	Really, really cool.
2768100	2769100	What is that tier called?
2769100	2772100	Buy Zach and Thomas hair plugs, please.
2772100	2775100	Please.
2775100	2780100	Hey, and we want to add a really big thank you to our guests from Basement Cats.
2780100	2781100	Basement Cats.
2781100	2782100	Straight up.
2782100	2783100	Ali and Lindsay.
2783100	2785100	And then Taylor also was there.
2785100	2786100	Your beautiful wife.
2786100	2789100	And all three of them really knocked it out of the park.
2789100	2793100	I was so stoked to have them be a part of this little adventure that we made together.
2793100	2797100	This is one of those things that Zach let us listen to, so I was able to join in-
2797100	2798100	Yeah.
2798100	2802100	It's the first time we've gotten to go back in here, kind of hear everything that went on behind our backs.
2802100	2804100	So that was a lot of fun to listen to.
2804100	2805100	Super fun.
2805100	2806100	And spooky.
2806100	2807100	Yeah.
2807100	2810100	It also just makes it way much more fun that it is closed because you get to record and
2810100	2814100	then every week you get to find out a little more of what was going on.
2814100	2815100	Yeah, right.
2815100	2816100	Exactly.
2816100	2822100	I was really nervous actually about running six PCs in one area, but I think everyone
2822100	2825100	had a pretty good time and it turned out sick.
2825100	2827100	I'm really happy with the end result.
2827100	2829100	I love listening to it.
2829100	2830100	And playing it.
2830100	2832100	And we got some cool artwork out of it too.
2832100	2833100	Oh my gosh.
2833100	2834100	Really cool artwork.
2834100	2836100	Go check out Witch Hazel.
2836100	2837100	I believe so.
2837100	2838100	Witch.hazel on Instagram.
2838100	2840100	You might check that she's okay with us saying it on air, but yeah.
2840100	2841100	Yeah.
2841100	2842100	It's witch.hazels.
2842100	2843100	I think it's plural.
2843100	2844100	Yeah.
2844100	2845100	It's dope though.
2845100	2848100	Super cool art of the girls' characters from this past story.
2848100	2850100	It's really, really well done.
2850100	2852100	And I checked out all her Instagram stuff.
2852100	2853100	It was all really cool.
2853100	2854100	Yeah.
2854100	2855100	Follow her.
2855100	2857100	Follow Basement Cats on Instagram.

2865100	2866100	Drive to Springfield.
2866100	2867100	Fly to Springfield.
2867100	2868100	We got an airport.
2868100	2869100	So.
2869100	2870100	Come drink with us.
2870100	2871100	We'll be at that show.
2871100	2872100	It'll be very fun.
2872100	2873100	Thanks for listening.
2873100	2881100	And we'll have more content for you that is part of the contention narrative coming very,
2881100	2882100	very soon.
2882100	2883100	Bye guys.
