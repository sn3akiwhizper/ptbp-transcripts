0	1920	Happy Friday, babies!
1920	5300	It's December 6th in PTBP time,
5300	8460	but it's Friday time in yo' time.
8460	10920	My producer wanted to let y'all know
10920	14220	that we are on a Friday release schedule now.
14220	16220	I'm sure it's so they can get up
16220	19220	to all sorts of debauchery on the weekends
19220	23680	without having to worry about producing this fine program,
23680	26060	or something like that.
26060	29320	I don't know, the producer never speaks to me anymore.
29340	32300	They just kind of ominously glare at me
32300	36140	while emitting white noise frequencies to frighten me.
36140	38440	Last week was regrettable.
38440	40100	I ate so much chowder
40100	43640	that I vomited continuously for a week straight.
43640	47560	I was empty, so very empty.
47560	50040	My stomach became an endless void
50040	53280	devoid of all hope and sustenance.
53280	55280	But y'all know what that means.
55280	58080	Just more room for clam gravy.
58080	61460	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Lady Betavir,
61460	64840	who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod.
64840	65960	She writes,
65960	70420	"'Dear Wolf, as my favorite time-traveling pirate radio host,
70420	72340	"'I was hoping that you could settle a debate
72340	74640	"'I've been having with some of my friends.
74640	77800	"'Recently, we got into a highly theoretical
77800	80020	"'and not at all realistic discussion
80020	81440	"'of whether it was impolite
81440	84020	"'to decline food offered to you on a visit,
84020	87280	"'particularly when your host was an elderly man
87300	90640	"'who may or may not be involved in a grisly murder,
90640	92020	"'and the food is a bladder
92020	94460	"'of incredibly questionable cold cuts,
94460	97420	"'olives, and warm baby vegetables.
97420	100200	"'My friend Ellery and I both agreed
100200	102300	"'that it was better not to eat anything
102300	105040	"'than to risk vomiting in front of your host,
105040	107160	"'but our friend Brew insisted
107160	109500	"'that it would be too rude to decline,
109500	112200	"'even if the olives seem to be looking at you
112200	114460	"'and the carrots have fingernails,
114460	116940	"'so we could just not all agree.
117480	119380	"'Now, I usually ask my handler,
119380	122680	"'er, my good fishing buddy, Lord Bonk,
122680	124360	"'about this kind of etiquette,
124360	125420	"'but when I brought it up,
125420	127440	"'he began mumbling under his breath
127440	131100	"'in some language with too many damn consonants,
131100	132620	"'like Welsh, maybe,
132620	135420	"'and rolling his eyes into the back of his head,
135420	138420	"'so I suspect he's not entirely sure either.
138420	140360	"'Do you have any insight to share
140360	143340	"'on the proper behavior for this oddly specific
143340	145640	"'and completely made-up scenario
145660	148160	"'that certainly has not happened to any of us?
148160	151760	"'Thanks from another loyal listener, Lady Bettevere.
151760	154180	"'P.S., if you ever get a hold of anyone
154180	156780	"'from the contention police department again,
156780	159200	"'please give them our kind regards.
159200	160560	"'We'd love to bring them
160560	163400	"'some completely unquestionable cookies,
163400	166660	"'but we haven't seen anyone at the station for two days,
166660	168300	"'or six months.
168300	169960	"'I'm actually not sure which it is,
169960	172160	"'but we miss them all the same.
172160	175200	"'Greetings, loyal listener Lady Bettevere.
175640	179840	"'In this house, we always eat whatever is given to us,
179840	183440	"'for the meat of man is still meat nonetheless,
183440	186040	"'and all meat is good.
186040	189400	"'And though you might vomit, worry not, children,
189400	193140	"'as that is but a sign of respect in the House of Wolf.
193140	195680	"'So I'm on Baby Brew's side,
195680	197120	"'and ask your old fishing buddy
197120	199420	"'to quit being a fucking weirdo.
199420	203820	"'Also, drop them unquestionable cookies off at my address.
203840	208000	"'Just smell around, I'm sure you'll find my abode.
208000	211820	"'To grow this show, send a memo to all that you know,
211820	215720	"'even your foe, to say hello to our fine audio.
215720	218380	"'And if you got dough, a Patreon subscription
218380	220400	"'would blow Wolf to and fro,
220400	224640	"'hitting falsetto while dancing flamenco on a rainbow.
224640	227680	"'From high in the sky to low and slow,
227680	232060	"'I'm on a booze cruise to soothe the news.
232080	234640	"'On the last episode, holiday hijinks
234640	237140	"'led Clark Bishop and Leon Simpson,
237140	240460	"'along with their new friend, Donovan something,
240460	243740	"'to the dorm room of Harriet Marks and Amelia Locke,
243740	247980	"'where Keith had information and John had changed.
247980	249760	"'In the room across the hall,
249760	252660	"'the group banged out the melody of Jingle Bells,
252660	256000	"'turned and saw the bell tower in the middle of the campus,
256000	257880	"'dressed in lights, wreaths,
257880	261000	"'and topped with a giant minion inflatable.
261020	264380	"'Just a reminder that it is December 6th here in the city,
264380	267600	"'so the whole holiday cheer thing is appropriate.
267600	269340	"'Kazoo with no backbone.'"
269340	290600	["The
292000	294860	And we're back in the groove, boys."
294860	296220	Ready to click record.
297700	300100	As you finish hammering out the tune to Jingle Bells
300100	302620	on this Casio keyboard, you hear the bell tower
302620	305820	in the center of campus ring out as well.
305820	308400	You see through the window of this dorm room,
308400	313080	the bell tower lights up in a congratulatory glow,
313080	316540	and snow begins to fall.
316540	318100	I think we need to go to there.
318100	320620	But that's just a weather thing.
321160	322000	That's just a John thing.
322000	324160	I turn away from the camera and I kind of like
325160	326800	smile and wink to myself.
328080	331620	Another camera gets it and you totally Jim the camera.
331620	334820	It's all about making moments in my line of work.
336540	340240	So is the plan to go to the Jingle Ball or,
340240	343720	I mean, we can assume that if this Alicia Locke,
343720	344560	what was her name?
344560	345400	Amelia.
345400	349080	Amelia Clark is down there,
349100	353540	then we can only assume that she's got more information
353540	355040	at least that we can talk to her.
355040	356060	So I guess we need to.
356060	358840	Yeah, I think she's probably the first one to get there.
358840	361380	So let's finish these clues and go talk to her.
361380	362760	We'll head to the bell tower.
362760	364380	Should we take the stairs or the elevator?
364380	365500	Not the elevator, it sounds like.
365500	366340	Yeah, probably not.
366340	368060	I'll just walk to not embarrass you.
368060	369160	As opposed to what?
371140	376000	He says that and John like rapidly rolls on all fours,
376000	377060	like out of the room.
377560	378880	What?
378880	379780	Rolls?
379780	381720	Yeah, he gets down and like,
383060	388060	he gets down into a ball and he rolls out of the room.
389780	392400	And then he turns around and he like winks at Donovan.
392400	394760	And he's like, roll sanity, Donovan.
397480	398520	I look at Clark and I'm like,
398520	401480	I'm thinking that body fucked him up a little bit.
401480	404280	Yeah, no shit, Keith, what the fuck?
404280	406760	But yeah, let's take the stairs to avoid
407300	408700	maybe that happening to you.
409940	410840	And away we go.
410840	413980	Walking across the campus, you see that the-
413980	415620	Walking and rolling.
415620	417020	I'm so sorry.
417020	418380	I'm walking next to you.
418380	421100	I was rolling to demonstrate how much more quickly
421100	424620	I would get places using my preferred method
424620	426220	of transportation.
426220	428220	Jesus Christ.
428220	431020	You guys are walking and not rolling,
431020	432420	rolling mentally maybe?
432420	435060	You guys are walking to the bell tower,
435080	436960	which is nearby on campus.
436960	440800	And you pass many a holiday accoutrement on your way there.
440800	445800	And the snow falling has made it a really delightful evening
445960	448680	even though it is quite quiet on this campus,
448680	453600	except for the distant noises of holiday cheer and screaming.
453600	456240	Other than that, it's quiet though.
456240	458520	Besides the cheer and the screaming.
458520	460080	Have you fellas noticed how much screaming
460080	461240	is happening around us?
462640	464280	No, not until just now.
464980	467700	When we were first entered that gifts hall,
467700	469820	that gifts house-
469820	470740	Is that a dinosaur?
470740	473400	Donovan walked into a room, flipped on the light,
473400	474880	and a real creepy little dude said,
474880	476540	turn off that light.
476540	479020	And we did and got the hell out of there.
479020	479860	What?
479860	481180	You didn't investigate it?
482300	484340	It scared us.
484340	485160	What?
485160	486700	We'll have to go back to that.
486700	487620	You remember that Donovan?
487620	490240	Yeah, I don't actually remember if it was a boy or a girl
490240	492420	so much as a shadowy entity.
492420	493940	And I just wasn't done with it.
494480	495320	I didn't really want to deal with that.
495320	496440	I just figured that all these screams
496440	499440	were coming from people in dark rooms and it scared us.
499440	501640	So we turned off the light real quick.
501640	503680	Well, that would have been nice to know,
503680	508680	but we'll get back to that, I guess.
508840	511360	And I continue walking towards the bell tower.
511360	515220	You guys make your way to an old stone bell tower
515220	520040	with a large gated entrance that is built into the rock
520060	524980	and stone formation that is forming this quite small,
524980	529980	cylindrical, phallic shape that it reaches
530260	533100	into the night December sky.
533100	536760	And the door has a gate right there.
536760	539140	There's a gate on the door, there's a door on the gate.
539140	541540	It's just a gate, it's not a door, and it's open.
541540	542420	I walk on in.
542420	543260	I follow.
543260	545260	So this is a dark stairwell.
545260	549380	It is open all the way up like a silo in the middle,
549600	554600	but there are these stone stairs that go in a spiral upward
555400	557040	to the very top.
557040	560880	Thomas is just drawing circles in his notes.
560880	562500	It's really horrifying.
564160	565000	Who's first?
565000	565840	Who's going first?
565840	566660	Keith Vigna's going first.
566660	567500	I'm going to go first.
567500	570120	And Keith Vigna, you about halfway up,
570120	574180	you see that there is a corpse on the stairwell.
574180	576960	I look back, I'm like, close your eyes, guys.
576960	578300	You're not going to want to see this.
578300	579240	Close our eyes?
580100	580940	Just trust me.
580940	581780	Looking past Keith Vigna.
581780	584500	Technically, I don't have eyes, but I'll humor you.
586300	588980	At this point, Keith is kind of like worried about Jon,
588980	591520	but also like, okay, whatever.
591520	594340	The world worries for me and I worry for the world
594340	597060	and neither of us can do a thing to help the other.
599060	601500	The corpse is wearing a security guard uniform.
604260	605280	And it's dead.
605280	608580	Guys, just close your eyes and keep going up the stairs.
608760	611720	And I stand by the corpse to kind of guide them past it.
611720	615200	I want to stop at Keith standing by the corpse.
615200	616920	I grab him by the shoulders.
616920	619200	Worry not about this vessel.
619200	621060	I'm not about you?
621060	623320	It is as much here as it ever was.
623320	624780	And it is not here.
624780	627080	Like it always wasn't.
627080	628700	Come up the stairs.
628700	629880	Let's go, Keith.
629880	632360	Same as it ever was.
632360	634780	There is water at the bottom of the ocean.
636200	637740	Keith is like just-
638200	639320	Pretty weirded out.
639320	640640	All right, Clark, come on.
640640	642200	Get past this and let's keep going.
642200	643040	I go past.
643040	643860	Okay.
643860	645200	I'm keeping my eyes open.
645200	646040	Okay.
646040	646860	Okay.
646860	647700	Nothing happens to me?
647700	648540	Nope.
648540	649360	Keith, I can look at the body, it seems like.
649360	650200	Okay, good.
650200	651040	I just didn't want-
651040	651860	It's face down.
651860	653560	You don't see any like blood or anything.
653560	654940	It's just a face down body.
654940	657500	So yeah, I mean, you could assume it's sleeping
657500	659320	if you want to rationalize it that way,
659320	662200	but you know based on the world that you've been living in
662200	665520	for the past however many, you know, whatevers.
665520	667360	It's probably dead.
667900	670580	Are there numbers and stuff all in this place too?
670580	671420	Any on the body?
671420	672700	Oh yeah, there's some on the body.
672700	674380	Anything that we've seen before?
674380	675220	Is it all-
675220	678280	Oh baby, we're in the wild west of numbers.
678280	679480	I turn back to Donovan.
679480	682140	Hey Donovan, you might, Keith's warning here,
682140	683660	you might want to shut them eyes.
683660	685860	Donovan is staring directly at the body.
688740	691020	But he's not like super phased by it
691020	693020	and he just like steps over it.
693020	695340	Oh, that was Jerry.
695340	696660	Didn't much care for him.
696720	698560	You actually see he's got a,
698560	701200	there is a notepad in Jerry's hand.
701200	702020	Who me?
702020	702860	Yeah.
702860	703700	Oh, couldn't be.
703700	704520	Do some investigating.
704520	705800	Hey, what is this?
705800	706620	Picks it up.
706620	710120	It's just a to-do list for tomorrow and it says retire.
713320	714380	Poor bastard.
716440	718700	It was wise of you to look closer.
718700	721060	I set up all kinds of jokes like these.
722100	723640	I continue up the stairs.
724140	727060	Clark, your friend's freaking me out.
727060	730320	John, you set this up?
730320	731320	Did you?
731320	732780	Keith, did he ever leave your sight?
732780	734220	He never did, no.
734220	736240	I laugh as they try to understand.
736240	737740	I don't know what's going on with him.
737740	739420	I think he might've had a break.
739420	740620	You don't say.
740620	741500	Holy shit.
741500	742620	Let's keep going.
742620	744500	As you approach the top of the tower,
744500	746700	you hear a voice that is mumbling.
746700	748540	And that's just right, I just,
748540	752980	42 can't find it, you know?
753160	755280	If we can't get higher from this perspective,
755280	757520	then we gotta figure it out later.
757520	758360	Hello?
758360	759200	Hello?
759200	760020	Oh, yes.
760020	760860	Oh my goodness.
760860	761700	Yes, peoples.
761700	762520	Yes, come on over.
762520	765240	Come on over to the top of the tower, please.
765240	766320	Can I see this person?
766320	767600	Yeah, as you approach,
767600	772240	it is an attractive girl who is in college age,
772240	773280	early twenties.
773280	777220	And she has two boobies.
779080	779920	God damn it.
779920	780760	No.
785740	789620	She has two buns on the back of her head, on her hair.
789620	791940	It's like grade A, grade A content.
791940	792780	And uh.
794420	795780	Subscribe to the Patreon.
798220	799060	Oh, thank you.
799060	801180	Luke cams on it.
801180	803180	I just want you to hear.
808280	810080	Oh, we're gonna make so much money.
810080	810920	On the Luke cam.
810920	812640	On the Luke cam.
812640	815400	Would you guys please help me get to the top of the tower?
815400	817280	And she's like got her hands on her head
817280	819880	and her eyes are wide and she's looking at all of you like,
819880	823160	oh my God, if you could just please take me to the two forts.
823160	825160	I can't take you to the top of the tower,
825160	828120	that'd be, that would just be fucking tits.
828140	831540	I look at her and I close my eyes and nod my head.
831540	833540	And is she still there when I open my eyes?
833540	834820	Everyone pull out your headphones
834820	836340	and then cover your ears real quick.
836340	841020	Hey Thomas, when John closes his eyes,
841020	845460	he just sees a mass of numbers flash before them.
845460	850220	And then he sees the visage of Clark Bishop age rapidly
850220	854420	and then age and reverse Benjamin Button style back down.
854440	858600	And then you see your own face take over for his face,
858600	862040	age in the same way and then age in reverse.
863240	865860	The beautiful topography of time.
865860	867480	As you open your eyes, she's still there.
867480	870360	And she's like, I don't think it,
870360	872780	can anyone get me to the top physically
872780	874400	with their bodies and hands and stuff?
874400	875240	What's your name?
875240	878920	Oh, my name is Sham Wow.
878920	880880	That's unfortunate.
880880	882440	No, it's Sham Wow Chameleon.
882440	883520	You didn't hear the whole thing.
883520	884520	Fucking millennials.
887620	888980	What's at the top?
888980	890140	Higher than this.
890140	892100	I'm just trying to get higher, baby.
892100	893780	Gotta take me higher.
893780	895620	Four, three, two, six.
895620	897500	Well, why do you need somebody to take you up there?
897500	899660	Well, because it's harder for me to do it
899660	900780	because I can't climb this rope.
900780	904940	And she points at the rope that the giant bell is on.
904940	907380	I'm afraid if I jump onto the bell by myself,
907380	910260	I won't be able to climb all the way and I'll fall and die.
910260	911260	I don't wanna fall and die.
911260	912620	So I wanna get to the top of the tower.
912640	913720	I wanna get higher tippy top.
913720	915640	If you had to think of any numbers in the universe,
915640	916480	what would they be?
916480	918560	Clark is getting his punching hand ready?
918560	920360	Immediately Leon Simpson puts on
920360	922400	his noise canceling headphones.
922400	925040	Are we at the top of this other than like climbing
925040	925880	up the rope to the bell?
925880	927080	Are we at the top of the tower?
927080	927920	Yes.
927920	928740	Cool.
928740	929580	There's lots of names.
929580	932700	There's numbers.
932700	933960	There's so many numbers.
933960	935040	They're inside my brain
935040	936840	and they keep coming out all over the place.
936840	940680	And you would not believe the week ahead,
940700	943700	but I guess like if I had to think about the ones
943700	944940	that speak to me most truly,
944940	949940	it would be 811-818-9520-1318-1119.
950180	952720	And all the rest of them are also in here,
952720	954340	but they're all over the place sideways
954340	955860	and on top of each other.
955860	959020	And it's just constant and it's all inside,
959020	959860	but I gotta get higher.
959860	961260	Was that Harriet?
961260	962100	Yeah.
962100	962920	I'm pretty sure it was.
962920	963760	Harriet.
963760	964580	Oh, you know Harriet.
964580	965420	Did you?
965420	966260	I know Harriet.
966260	967100	I know you.
967100	969380	I know everyone on your campus.
969380	970620	I know your mother, your father.
971440	972280	That's wild.
972280	973480	You know, the chameleons.
973480	974640	John, thanks for a minute.
974640	977120	And it's like, they're not coming to mind right now,
977120	978720	but yes, of course.
978720	979560	Wow.
979560	980380	Did you know Harriet?
980380	981220	Marks?
981220	982060	Yeah, yeah.
982060	982880	Yeah, I mean, not too many people
982880	985020	are named Harriet these days.
985020	986080	Can you get me higher?
986080	987280	What do you need up there for?
987280	988520	I just gotta get higher.
988520	989520	Number one.
989520	992800	Number one, I gotta get higher.
992800	994560	Are you working on the scavenger hunt?
994560	995940	Yes, for sure.
995940	998360	But most importantly, gotta get higher than I am here.
998360	999740	This is the highest spot I've been
999760	1001040	and the highest spot I can be,
1001040	1002600	but I could get higher with you guys' help
1002600	1003760	if you wanna help me get higher.
1003760	1005520	Do you know what would happen if you got higher?
1005520	1006720	Feel good.
1006720	1009080	I wanna look around and see if I can find like a clue
1009080	1010600	that would have led us here.
1010600	1014280	She grabs onto Donovan's like shirt
1014280	1015960	and is like, take me higher.
1015960	1018500	I don't, no, I don't wanna talk to you.
1018500	1019600	Roll search for me.
1019600	1020440	What are you looking for?
1020440	1022960	Just like another clue, like why we came up here.
1022960	1023800	Sure.
1023800	1024620	35 on a 40.
1024620	1027040	Yeah, so looking out from the bell tower,
1027060	1030500	you very clearly see across the way,
1030500	1034740	there is a sleigh that is completely lit up in lights
1034740	1037900	that is on top of a building across campus,
1037900	1042660	which Donovan, you would know is the Accord Student Center.
1042660	1044140	We drove here in an Accord.
1044140	1045200	You think there's any connection?
1045200	1046740	Donovan, what's that sleigh?
1046740	1047940	That's the Accord Student Center.
1047940	1050100	That's where a lot of people meet up.
1050100	1051620	Perhaps a ball could be there?
1051620	1054820	In the sleigh is a brightly lit sign
1054840	1057560	that points to a light up chimney.
1057560	1062560	And the sign says in all caps, the jingle ball is this way.
1063960	1066080	You guys, I think that might be where we need to go next.
1066080	1067920	Are you telling me we did a scavenger hunt
1067920	1070960	to be told that the jingle ball was at the student union?
1073120	1075500	And that we're all balls are held?
1075500	1079280	Yeah, what's the problem is a really hard rule to solve.
1079280	1081360	Hey, y'all remember how we might all be balls?
1081360	1082440	You think there's something to do that?
1082440	1084220	Jingle balls, balls.
1084760	1085820	I'm not convinced I'm ball.
1085820	1088080	Let's go back to that.
1088080	1089760	You said that you're all balls?
1089760	1091200	No, my child.
1091200	1092520	Can you take me higher?
1092520	1094360	You're all balls though?
1094360	1096200	Would you just do the top of the thing?
1096200	1099160	I'm sorry, you said that you all were balls.
1099160	1100160	You'd like to be.
1100160	1102440	I just need to get on top of this bell tower
1102440	1103280	as fast as possible.
1103280	1104600	I wouldn't listen to John right now.
1104600	1107100	You can hear how he's been talking some gibberish.
1107100	1109720	I just, he's just out of it right now.
1109720	1110560	Well, persuade.
1111100	1115620	I'd like to confess his rule.
1115620	1116460	Oh, okay.
1116460	1117300	You can roll persuade.
1118340	1120800	Profits are never appreciated in their own time.
1120800	1121660	No, they die.
1121660	1122940	I keep sending them though.
1122940	1123780	81.
1125900	1126860	Yeah, okay.
1126860	1128860	That's fair.
1128860	1131700	I guess balls.
1131700	1132700	So if you could just take me
1132700	1134100	to the very top of this bell tower,
1134100	1134940	it's just right around.
1134940	1136660	So you see how it's open right here?
1136660	1139940	I think if you two of you stand right on the edge,
1140160	1143160	you can hold my feet with your hands on your knees,
1143160	1145480	maybe thigh, maybe I could get some upper thigh
1145480	1150080	and then I could work my way up
1150080	1152960	with my sleek rock climbing abilities
1152960	1155040	to get even on top of the tower even more.
1155040	1156920	I'm kind of ignoring this person
1156920	1159240	and I look at, we don't need to help.
1159240	1161720	Well, I was thinking we might as well just help her
1161720	1162920	and then get over the ball.
1162920	1164520	Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
1164520	1165360	I'll see you there.
1165360	1166640	I have a feeling she's gonna follow us
1166640	1168440	and annoy us if we don't do this for her.
1168440	1169880	Plus I just wanna see what happens.
1169880	1173020	You guys could take me higher
1173020	1175980	and that's who I wanna be.
1175980	1179180	If you could take me to the Christmas sky,
1179180	1182060	I could feel it with all of my might.
1182060	1185740	I get down to like in the position she told us to get
1185740	1186980	and I just kind of look over.
1186980	1189300	I look over at Clark and kind of shrug my shoulders.
1189300	1191860	I just feel like we're leading this person to their death.
1191860	1193300	They're gonna fall off that rope.
1193300	1195820	I look over at Donovan and I'm pointing in front of me
1195820	1197140	and I shrug my shoulder.
1197140	1198460	I have an idea.
1198480	1200080	Clark, will you strike this woman down
1200080	1201320	as you did the others?
1204480	1205560	I'm not too bright, Clark,
1205560	1207680	but I think it would solve all our problems
1207680	1209000	if you struck this woman.
1209000	1210640	Clark cracks his knuckles.
1210640	1212400	It's like, well, that's true.
1212400	1213400	I could just knock her out.
1213400	1214640	John moves in front of her.
1214640	1215640	If you're gonna knock her out,
1215640	1217680	we might as well help her keep her dreams.
1217680	1218920	My savior, take me higher.
1218920	1221120	John holds his hands up in front of him
1221120	1222440	and he's like, Clark.
1222440	1225720	Our John is an awesome John.
1225720	1229340	He reigns from heaven above with hands.
1229340	1231420	I keep one hand pointed out to John,
1231420	1234700	but I put one hand behind me and I put it on her forehead.
1234700	1235540	Your John.
1235540	1239300	With her hand on my forehead, take me higher, Satan.
1243300	1244740	Is anybody gonna help me out here?
1244740	1247980	Honestly, I have no idea what's happening anymore.
1248980	1250860	I just feel like if we help her onto this rope,
1250860	1251700	that's a death sentence for her.
1251700	1253260	Well, you're gonna punch her, so.
1253260	1254220	It'd just knock her out though.
1254220	1255060	That wouldn't kill her.
1255200	1257680	Just so many potential complications.
1257680	1259240	We could also just leave.
1259240	1260080	We don't have to.
1260080	1262080	No, no, you don't have to leave.
1262080	1262920	Come on, God.
1264680	1267980	You're gonna make me leave with your hand upon my skin?
1267980	1269000	I will help you, my child.
1269000	1270560	And Keith Vigner, are you gonna help us out?
1270560	1271520	Yeah, I'm gonna help too.
1271520	1272360	Sick.
1272360	1274720	All right, so between the two of you,
1274720	1277440	who has the better luck?
1277440	1278840	I have 35 him.
1278840	1280000	I'll have you roll it.
1283200	1284120	A three.
1284180	1285020	Oh!
1287100	1289420	You help her out the little opening
1289420	1291440	that's looking out onto the campus,
1291440	1294020	and she is starting to climb up,
1294020	1298540	clearly misses with one of her hands and begins to fall,
1298540	1300580	but you catch her legs,
1300580	1302780	and she immediately holds on with both
1302780	1304500	and then fucking sends it,
1304500	1309220	getting a full grip of the gargantuan inflatable minion
1309220	1312400	that tops this CSU bell tower.
1312400	1316300	You hear the swooshing of final coated nylon,
1316300	1317540	and then...
1317540	1318380	I'm higher!
1319620	1322100	Ooh, yeah, eight, one, whoa, ooh, yeah,
1322100	1324220	it's fun, four, five, six, seven, eight,
1324220	1327100	kind of, you gotta get it up on the sky
1327100	1328900	with the Christmas spirit,
1328900	1332380	and my God fell into helping me aware
1332380	1337020	whose phone is ringing while we're recording a podcast.
1337020	1337860	Fucking Justin.
1337860	1340100	I'm sorry, it's all right, I'm hearing it.
1340100	1342100	Oh, there we go.
1342600	1346080	Are we good now, is that, is it over?
1346080	1348920	Yeah, I feel better, let's go to the ball.
1348920	1351060	Yeah, let's head on down.
1351060	1353400	It's time to finally get my prize I deserve.
1353400	1355520	How is she gonna get down from up there though, guys?
1355520	1357000	She got up there pretty easily, so.
1357000	1358220	With the help, okay.
1359400	1361560	The world works in mysterious ways.
1361560	1364200	I go down the stairs.
1364200	1366120	You see the security guard on your way back.
1366120	1366960	Hey, Jerry.
1366960	1368680	Same spot, but he'll hop over.
1368680	1370560	And then at the bottom of the staircase,
1370580	1375020	you guys enter the, essentially the quad of this campus,
1375020	1378340	and you head over to the Accord Student Union
1378340	1380900	that is just across the way.
1380900	1382620	And as you walk up to it,
1382620	1385060	you see that there are a couple different entrances.
1385060	1385900	There are three in front of you.
1385900	1388780	You can go left, center, or right.
1388780	1389820	Are any of them lit?
1389820	1391580	John just walked straight through the center door
1391580	1392860	without waiting for discussion.
1392860	1393700	Right on.
1393700	1394860	Follow John?
1394860	1395740	I guess.
1395740	1397980	Yeah, I'll follow John, are we all following John?
1397980	1398820	Let's head in.
1398840	1400800	He seems really confident now.
1400800	1403800	Are we following the guy who was rolling around earlier?
1403800	1405080	Yeah, yeah.
1405080	1407080	He actually does a little roll through the door.
1408680	1410680	Donovan, he's not always like this.
1410680	1412200	In fact, it's a little worrisome.
1412200	1414920	I just am trying to keep the eye on the prize right now
1414920	1417120	and figure that out later, I guess.
1417120	1418700	Yeah, seems smart.
1419880	1422960	As you guys walk in, the lights are off.
1422960	1427720	However, there is a path of colorful string lights
1427720	1432020	on the ground, like a pathway or a road.
1432020	1436460	You notice that there is a little sitting area to your left
1436460	1438780	where there are some tables and chairs set up.
1438780	1443300	And sitting in one of the chairs is a corpse
1443300	1446220	that is quite fermented.
1446220	1448980	It has been here for some time, you would guess,
1448980	1449820	by the looks of it.
1449820	1454820	And right next to that corpse is a very alive person
1455200	1457680	dancing their ass off.
1458560	1459840	Just fucking getting it.
1459840	1462480	I've seen pictures of Amelia, is this her?
1462480	1463320	Nope.
1463320	1464240	Hey, where's the ball?
1464240	1468040	The dancing fiend continues their grind
1468040	1472060	and with their hips motions in the way that you're headed.
1473720	1475280	Thank you, thank you very much.
1479400	1480240	I go that way.
1480240	1481680	I'll continue on too, yeah.
1481680	1483080	That's not Tim Fate with.
1483100	1484900	I dance with him for a little while.
1485940	1488060	It's just like a few bars,
1488060	1491140	like I am grooving to the beat and then I walk on.
1491140	1492060	Easy peasy.
1492060	1494220	You would notice that the student union is-
1494220	1495640	They have no idea.
1495640	1499180	The path of colorful lights and thumping holiday base
1499180	1500900	leads the five of you,
1500900	1504220	four imposters in city PD uniforms
1504220	1507240	and a nicely dressed fifth year college student
1507240	1509220	to a three story atrium,
1509220	1511580	kind of like a small square shopping mall.
1511600	1514560	But instead of Forever 21 and Orange Julius,
1514560	1517400	there's a CSU merch shop and a subway.
1517400	1518600	You're on the middle level,
1518600	1521720	so looking down you see the basement of this atrium
1521720	1524840	and it's decked out in jingle ball decorations.
1524840	1528160	But in drastic contrast to this festive cheer,
1528160	1532240	you are surrounded only by pure chaos,
1532240	1536600	personified by obsessive college students and faculty.
1536600	1538920	Across the atrium on your level,
1538980	1543100	there's a girl shaving the fur off a team of reindeer
1543100	1544900	in front of a photo backdrop
1544900	1549820	and she is shaking and gluing the loose fur to her own skin.
1549820	1550940	On the bottom level,
1550940	1555180	a pair of very tall and muscular men in Santa outfits
1555180	1558060	are diligently wrapping a college student
1558060	1559740	in gift wrapping paper.
1559740	1562740	They are using duct tape and force.
1562740	1564700	An older woman in a bathrobe
1564700	1567300	and one of those fur lined leather aviator hats
1567300	1570640	that cover your ears is climbing a thick garland
1570640	1572840	from this level up to the top.
1572840	1575040	The garland wraps around these columns
1575040	1577360	that encircle the opening to the atrium
1577360	1579400	every 10 yards or so
1579400	1581880	and they all meet in the center of the dome
1581880	1586640	atop this part of the Accord Student Union here at CSU.
1586640	1588640	Hanging from the middle of this dome
1588640	1593400	is a massive disco ball, 10 yards in diameter,
1593400	1596360	wearing an equally huge Santa hat.
1596380	1597700	That's college, baby.
1597700	1599180	That's college.
1599180	1601220	Three people in elf costumes
1601220	1603320	are in the corner of the lower level
1603320	1605020	in a little ice skating rink
1605020	1608300	with a life-size Frosty the Snowman figure.
1608300	1610920	They keep putting the carrot in different places
1610920	1613420	while laughing hysterically.
1613420	1617380	A naked man is using a mop and a mop bucket full of paint
1617380	1619300	to write out a sequence of numbers
1619300	1621980	at the bottom of the stairs to the lower level.
1621980	1624540	Across the room on the bottom floor,
1624540	1628480	there is a young woman throwing a laptop in the air
1628480	1631840	and trying to spin around in a circle before catching it.
1631840	1634000	She is doing this fervently
1634000	1636160	and she's wearing a shirt that says,
1636160	1641160	gifts house on the back and best RA ever on the front.
1642440	1643840	It says, if I make it this far,
1643840	1648120	a dude doing squats on top of Santa Claus's throne stops
1648120	1650680	and begins violently chanting,
1650680	1655680	Towel alico, towel alico, towel alico, towel alico.
1658780	1660080	That's college, baby.
1661620	1665140	I look at the man who's chanting and I just,
1665140	1666780	I just boom out.
1666780	1669040	I command you to stop.
1669040	1669880	Roll.
1669880	1673020	And I wave my hand, I just gotta wave a hand at him.
1673020	1674120	Roll persuade for me.
1675660	1680620	Got a 76 on a, probably not higher than that.
1681440	1682280	We're sitting in new places
1682280	1683600	and it's hard for me to see my character sheet.
1683600	1685100	No, that's a fail.
1685100	1690100	Towel alico, towel alico, towel alico.
1690120	1691680	And when he keeps going,
1691680	1693240	I kind of look at my hand in confusion.
1693240	1696280	John, who were you talking to, was that man?
1696280	1697640	Oh, you were, gotcha.
1697640	1699880	I look at Clark, I get my gun out
1699880	1702000	and I like look at him and point it at the guy
1702000	1704160	and like questioning the look in my eyes.
1704160	1705260	John's just nodding.
1706760	1707840	He must be punished.
1708100	1710780	Towel alico, whatever, what's that?
1710780	1712860	I've heard it before, but I,
1712860	1714420	It sounds like a spell, right?
1714420	1716540	That's what I'm thinking and I think we need to stop it.
1716540	1718420	Do we remember what it is?
1718420	1719900	So far, I don't know.
1719900	1721460	It could have done a number of things.
1721460	1724020	Listen, it's been a while since we played, but that is,
1724020	1724860	We've heard it a lot.
1724860	1725680	We've heard it a lot, right?
1725680	1726520	I just don't remember what it does.
1726520	1727840	I don't think it's done anything yet.
1727840	1729540	Isn't it just the phrase?
1729540	1731780	I punched your brother's partner
1731780	1733000	when you started saying it.
1733000	1734660	Yeah, so we've stopped everybody.
1734660	1735500	It's done it so far.
1735500	1737060	Yeah, maybe we have stopped it every time.
1737160	1739440	Yeah, so I'm like looking at,
1739440	1742320	Keith is looking at Clark ready to shoot this guy just,
1742320	1745280	I don't know why I'm asking for permission this time, but.
1746260	1747560	Clark shrugs.
1747560	1748400	I fire.
1749720	1750840	Roll firearms.
1753640	1754680	That's a two.
1754680	1756320	So anyway, I started blasting.
1759100	1761640	Holy shit, all right, cool, so.
1761640	1765160	Hey, maybe we should make a role-playing decision
1765180	1766940	that's not shooting up a college.
1770140	1770980	Fucking food court.
1770980	1771820	They're monsters.
1771820	1774880	Too late, so roll damage for me.
1776340	1777180	A nine.
1777180	1778000	Oh my God.
1780360	1781340	Where do you shoot him?
1781340	1782340	Right in chest.
1782340	1783180	Yep.
1784440	1788060	As two shots hit this man, center mass,
1788060	1792300	he falls back into the throne of one Santa Claus
1792320	1796080	and begins bleeding as he continues to slowly,
1796080	1797740	quietly chant,
1805240	1808540	Oh, and he succeeds on a constitution check
1808540	1810320	and stays conscious,
1810320	1813040	but fewer can hear his chant.
1813040	1815080	Does the crowd react at all?
1815080	1816080	Yes, absolutely.
1816080	1818400	The crowd a hundred percent reacts, so.
1818400	1820920	Yay, I'm the star of the show now.
1821900	1823260	Everybody look at me.
1823260	1824100	Spotlight online.
1824100	1826020	I'm the DJ now.
1826020	1827980	As soon as you fire the gun,
1827980	1832760	everyone in this room turns and looks at the five of you.
1832760	1836300	Everyone then looks at the Santa throne
1836300	1840500	where this man is bleeding all over while still chanting.
1840500	1845300	Reindeer fur girl immediately turns and begins sharpening
1845300	1849140	one of the horns on one of these live reindeer.
1849140	1850220	The Santa twins.
1850240	1851840	Wait, these are live reindeer?
1851840	1853160	Oh yeah, baby.
1853160	1854000	Oh shit.
1854000	1855000	Was not aware of that.
1855000	1856440	Yeah, I definitely thought he just
1856440	1857840	more fucked up reindeer.
1857840	1860200	Were they letting her shave them willingly
1860200	1861200	or were they struggling again?
1861200	1863360	She was cutting off their fur.
1863360	1865560	They're tied up for a photo shoot
1865560	1869080	and she's cutting off their fur with a blunt knife
1869080	1870320	that she carries with her.
1870320	1871520	Holy shit.
1872440	1873360	Should have shot her first.
1873360	1875640	Yeah, that's not cool.
1875640	1878880	So she begins sharpening one of these reindeer's horns.
1878900	1881540	The Santa twins, the two giant muscular men
1881540	1884500	dressed as Santa Claus, start wrapping each other
1884500	1887780	as opposed to this undergrad that they were wrapping before
1887780	1890700	and they're using duct tape to wrap around
1890700	1892580	the gift wrapping on each other.
1892580	1894660	I wanted to ask about that guy who's being wrapped.
1894660	1896680	Does he seem under the same spell as everyone
1896680	1898420	or was he maybe fighting against them?
1898420	1902900	He was compulsively staying as still as possible.
1902900	1903740	Gotcha.
1903740	1906960	Cousin Eddie Lady Climber starts climbing faster
1906980	1911100	and faster up this garland and is trying desperately
1911100	1913300	to end like to the point to where she's like
1913300	1916500	losing grip on the garland and still making it up.
1916500	1918060	She's in very good shape.
1918060	1920940	The three elves in the corner, they begin sitting
1920940	1924820	on the ground and unlacing their ice skates.
1924820	1929220	The naked mop man begins squeezing paint back
1929220	1933540	into his mop bucket and the girl throwing the laptop
1933540	1936200	in the air begins throwing it way higher
1936200	1938520	than she was before, so much higher.
1938520	1941760	Like she's throwing this laptop 20 feet in the air
1941760	1945680	every time and still catching it currently.
1945680	1946500	Luke, you had a question?
1946500	1949360	So there's the basement level, the middle level
1949360	1951040	that we're on and then an upper level?
1951040	1951880	Yes.
1951880	1952920	Okay, who's on the basement level?
1952920	1956560	The basement level is the man who is in the throne
1956560	1960040	of Santa Claus who is chanting and bleeding out currently.
1960040	1962880	The Santa twins are on the basement level as well
1962900	1964640	who are wrapping each other with gift wrapping
1964640	1965980	and duct tape.
1965980	1970040	The three elves in the ice skating rink are also
1970040	1973540	in the basement level as is the naked mop man
1973540	1977540	who is squeezing paint back into his mop bucket
1977540	1978980	as is the laptop girl.
1978980	1980780	Luke, ask him your real question.
1980780	1982260	What have we talked about?
1982260	1983100	Ask him what it's like to have sex.
1983100	1983940	You can ask me anything Luke.
1983940	1986080	Ask him what it's like to have sex.
1986080	1987660	That's for later, that's not on the packet.
1987660	1988740	I wanna know.
1988740	1990900	Who's on the level we're on?
1990900	1991900	I want you to show me.
1991920	1993080	Make him tell us.
1995160	1997280	On your level.
1997280	1998840	Who's on our level?
1998840	1999700	Thomas.
2002120	2005320	On your level is the reindeer fur girl
2005320	2008920	and then on the next level climbing up to the next level
2008920	2010600	is the cousin lady climber.
2010600	2012040	Gotcha, thank you.
2012040	2014400	I wanna draw my pistol if I can.
2014400	2016040	Yeah, we're in free play right now
2016040	2017960	so you can do whatever you want.
2017960	2018800	Yeah, I don't know.
2018800	2019640	Are we starting combat?
2019640	2020460	No, we are, yeah.
2020460	2021300	Okay, cool.
2021560	2023600	I draw my pistol and point it at the reindeer girl
2023600	2026800	and I say, touch not mine creatures
2026800	2029920	and then I look at my gun and I'm like,
2029920	2032120	I must use these mortal instruments
2032120	2035000	to achieve my divine means.
2035000	2035840	Fire, I aim in fire.
2035840	2038480	Okay, so she is across the atrium from you
2038480	2040000	so as you say that.
2040000	2041240	I got a 65.
2041240	2043620	You're just assuming that as you speak
2043620	2045080	that she'll be able to hear you
2045080	2047880	regardless of the volume of your voice.
2047880	2048760	I'm assuming.
2048760	2049600	Who are you talking to now, John?
2050060	2051660	Putting it out into the universe,
2052940	2053860	which is me.
2053860	2055100	Roll firearms for me.
2055100	2057100	I am the universe experience in itself.
2058220	2059940	43 on a 60.
2059940	2061840	All right, roll a D10 for damage.
2063060	2063900	Seven.
2063900	2065500	She gets hit once in the shoulder,
2065500	2067360	immediately falls to the ground
2067360	2068900	and the bullet goes through
2068900	2070340	and one of the reindeer's
2070340	2073580	and then falls over as well
2073580	2076500	and she is on the ground bleeding
2077320	2082320	as she tries to grab on to the hairless reindeer
2082440	2084820	in front of her to help herself up.
2084820	2088000	She goes limp and her head just like hits the ground.
2088000	2090200	Can I have Mercy kill that reindeer real quick?
2092280	2095720	The look on Zach's face just now is, huh.
2095720	2096560	I just threw up.
2097520	2099600	You're the one who made me shoot a fucking reindeer.
2099600	2103240	I just want to resolve that as quickly as possible.
2103240	2104880	I'm just telling the story, man.
2107440	2108840	This is just what happened.
2110200	2111040	It's not my fault.
2111040	2112160	It's not your fault.
2115200	2116040	Life is chaos.
2116040	2117540	Dude, you can't change the past.
2120120	2120960	Go for it.
2122120	2122960	97.
2122960	2123780	God damn it.
2123780	2124880	I shoot another reindeer.
2130560	2132760	That's going to be a fucked up photo shoot.
2134200	2136160	Well, she fucked it up by shaving him already.
2136980	2137820	Sorry about that.
2137820	2138660	Did you just shake your-
2141180	2143700	He just grabbed his McDonald's cup and shook it.
2144540	2145380	That was habit.
2146500	2147340	Oh boy.
2147340	2148160	Okay.
2148160	2149000	Love that.
2152340	2154060	How many drankies are left in here?
2158940	2160140	We're better than this.
2162180	2164080	Maybe, I don't know.
2164900	2165740	I am.
2165740	2166580	You're not.
2168580	2170500	I hope that's your character talking.
2172500	2173340	Hey Donovan.
2173340	2174160	Hey.
2174160	2175300	Hey, what are you thinking, man?
2175300	2176580	Mildly panicked.
2176580	2177400	Uh-huh.
2178260	2179840	Do you want to go ahead and roll sanity for me?
2179840	2180680	Yeah.
2180680	2182360	I don't know what to roll it against.
2182360	2184020	You'll roll against a,
2184020	2186100	I think based on the week that you've had,
2186100	2189400	you're going to roll it against a pretty solid 58.
2189400	2190240	Sounds right.
2190380	2194220	54.
2196220	2197060	Very well done.
2197060	2197900	Okay.
2197900	2199460	You can hold yourself together for the time being,
2199460	2201480	but just so you know,
2201480	2203380	this is the first time that Donovan,
2203380	2206260	I'm assuming has seen anyone get shot
2206260	2207980	or maybe even any animal.
2207980	2208800	Yes.
2208800	2209640	Oh, for sure.
2209640	2212860	You've never seen a reindeer get blasted in the face.
2212860	2213700	Raw vegan?
2213700	2214520	Yeah.
2214520	2215740	Only sprouts for this boy.
2217300	2218140	You know what?
2218140	2218960	That's really cool.
2218960	2219800	I really respect that.
2219800	2220640	Thank you.
2223180	2224020	Anyway.
2226020	2228140	I think Donovan, after the first gunshot,
2228140	2229220	it's like, what the fuck?
2229220	2230420	And like freaking out.
2230420	2233020	Cause it's the first time a gun has been fired
2233020	2235460	probably in his vicinity ever.
2235460	2236300	Yeah.
2236300	2237120	And it is quite frightening.
2237120	2240780	I would imagine to a fifth year college student.
2240780	2241620	It's yeah.
2241620	2243900	It's the first time he's seen a gun since high school.
2243900	2244720	Yeah.
2244720	2246060	Or violence.
2246060	2246980	Wow.
2247000	2251040	So America has an epidemic of gun violence.
2251040	2253120	So as the second gunshot rings out,
2253120	2257200	everyone begins to panic and obsess a little bit harder.
2257200	2259780	If Clark wanted to get to the girl
2259780	2262680	who was throwing the laptop, how would he do that?
2262680	2263520	He wants to do that.
2263520	2264340	Okay.
2264340	2265840	So you would have to go down the stairs
2265840	2267280	into the basement of the atrium
2267280	2272280	and then past the Santa twins and the naked mop man
2273280	2274940	before you got to the laptop girl.
2274940	2276800	I'm going to yell at the guys, cover me.
2277620	2278460	And I'm going down the stairs.
2278460	2279380	So you take off running.
2279380	2282060	If they successfully cover you,
2282060	2283980	then you'll make it there no problem.
2283980	2285980	Well, I mean, I have my own wherewithal.
2285980	2287820	If something, if something wants to stop me,
2287820	2289560	I get to, I get to fight back,
2289560	2290580	but I'm hoping that they'll.
2290580	2292700	Leon is going to be like, I'm with you.
2292700	2294660	And is joining you.
2294660	2296460	I hear him yell to cover him.
2296460	2298540	And the first person between him
2298540	2300620	and the top girl is the twins.
2300620	2301460	Yes.
2301460	2303100	I'm going to run behind with him.
2303100	2305660	But right before I start going down the stairs,
2305680	2307400	take a shot at the one on the left.
2307400	2308240	All right.
2308240	2309060	Roll firearms.
2310960	2311800	That's a one.
2315800	2316640	Okay.
2316640	2317480	I say.
2320360	2322480	Celebratory shake.
2322480	2324920	We've got our own manual drops.
2326200	2328760	As I do it, I hear Clark say, cover me.
2328760	2330240	And I'm like, hell yeah, Clark.
2330240	2334360	And then I look directly into the eyes of that twin.
2334380	2336860	And I say, I'm the bill of the ball.
2336860	2337860	Ding, ding.
2337860	2340300	And then pull the gun and shoot him
2340300	2341500	right between the eyeballs.
2341500	2342340	Yeah.
2342340	2343160	And Santa dies.
2343160	2344540	You're the new Santa Claus.
2345380	2346220	Look at me.
2346220	2347040	I'm the Santa now.
2349620	2353380	The other Santa does not miss a beat.
2353380	2357620	Grabs the duct tape out of the hand of his fellow Santa
2357620	2360500	as the man just drops to the ground.
2360500	2362500	The duct tape being the only thing left.
2362520	2367120	And he just smoothly continues wrapping himself
2367120	2368040	in this duct tape.
2368040	2368860	I would look at Clark.
2368860	2371320	I'm like, they may, they seem like they may not be
2371320	2372160	our biggest obstacles.
2372160	2374360	Yeah, they're gonna take care of themselves here, so.
2375480	2376880	And I follow suit.
2376880	2378800	Clark is running at the laptop girl.
2378800	2379640	Yeah.
2379640	2381360	The Santa guys are taking care of themselves.
2381360	2383100	No one's fucking with any more reindeer.
2383100	2385040	Are there any threats we see around us?
2385040	2388000	You've got old lady maybe potentially climbing your way
2388000	2388840	or was she above us already?
2388840	2390040	Climbing to the second floor.
2390040	2392320	Climbing from the second to the third floor.
2392980	2393820	And we're on the second floor?
2393820	2394640	Yeah.
2394640	2395480	Can I reach her?
2395480	2396700	Like if I reached over the edge, could I like grab her?
2396700	2398860	You'd have to like run around the side
2398860	2401080	and then probably get on the garland yourself
2401080	2402740	and begin climbing before you got to her.
2402740	2405700	Cause she, when those first gunshots rang out,
2405700	2408040	she really started going for it.
2408040	2410340	She's free soloing this bitch like a moat.
2410340	2411380	I just watched that.
2411380	2412540	It was so fucking good.
2412540	2414700	I mean, I know everybody said it and that's old news, but.
2414700	2415740	My hands are sweaty.
2417220	2418060	Unrelated.
2418060	2419780	Yeah, I want to shoot the old broad.
2419780	2421660	Jesus Christ.
2421720	2422560	I'm kidding.
2423760	2425760	I'm going to cover, I'm going to cover Joe.
2425760	2426960	Clark, I want to see.
2426960	2427800	Oh yeah.
2427800	2428920	Can you ready an action in Delta Green?
2428920	2430400	You can ready an action in Delta Green.
2430400	2432160	So I'm going to be on Overwatch for Clark.
2432160	2433000	Dope.
2433000	2433820	Sounds good, Justin.
2433820	2434660	What's Donovan doing?
2434660	2436360	He pulls out his grenade launcher.
2438440	2440440	Is there like a weapon nearby that like,
2440440	2442720	like even like a bat or a plant,
2442720	2444000	it's like some kind of thing I could use
2444000	2446660	as a makeshift weapon just to like arm myself.
2446660	2449560	Actually, as you're looking around for a makeshift weapon.
2449560	2451000	You see a bat flying around
2451380	2452220	and you just grab it out of the air
2452220	2453860	and chuck it at one of the Santas.
2453860	2455480	You become Batman.
2455480	2456320	Bad man?
2456320	2457140	Bad man.
2457140	2457980	So as.
2457980	2458820	Badminton?
2458820	2459660	Badminton.
2459660	2462500	So as you're shuttle cocking your way,
2462500	2465100	Leon Simpson, halfway down the stairs,
2465100	2468260	turns and goes, shit, Clark, I forgot.
2468260	2470820	And runs right back up the stairs
2470820	2473340	and throws a gun to Donovan
2473340	2475460	and then grabs you by the shoulder
2475460	2478040	and takes you like around a corner
2478100	2479540	where you both can watch,
2479540	2482300	but you're a little bit safer away from everything.
2482300	2483700	Sounds like a good plan.
2483700	2485420	I mean, you can get out there if you want,
2485420	2486980	but I would rather you didn't
2486980	2489940	based on the fact that as of now our current theory
2489940	2491140	is that you're our savior.
2491140	2494300	Oh, that's like a lot to put on me, but I, sure.
2494300	2496080	You're gonna do great things in this world
2496080	2497420	and if you don't, it's on you.
2497420	2499100	He just like gets really sad
2499100	2500500	and looks down at the ground.
2502180	2503460	Okay.
2503460	2504420	Okay, so you understand
2504420	2505980	that you should probably not die today?
2506520	2509520	That was my, that was kind of my plan was not to be dead.
2509520	2510560	I think we're good to go.
2510560	2511400	Thanks.
2511400	2512220	So.
2512220	2513460	Wait, wait, wait, how do I use this?
2513460	2515720	Oh, right, and then he shows you how to use it,
2515720	2517560	but like very quickly.
2517560	2520160	Yeah, I'll definitely remember, I'm smart.
2520160	2523000	Roll a 50-50 shot on whether or not
2523000	2524800	you know how to use this gun at all.
2524800	2526280	Do I like flip a coin?
2526280	2528600	Just roll, if you roll under 50,
2528600	2530040	you know how to do it, yeah.
2532200	2533240	Under 50.
2533300	2536020	With that, we'll give you a 30% in firearms.
2536020	2537020	Ooh.
2537020	2537860	Nice.
2537860	2539180	It feels natural.
2541100	2544220	Why have I not been using this all this time?
2544220	2546100	Your new friends certainly like doing it.
2546100	2548760	So, the Santa twin that's left,
2548760	2550900	the lady climbing up the garland,
2550900	2553500	all three elves, the naked mop man,
2553500	2556140	and the girl throwing the laptop in the air,
2556140	2558780	all stop what they're doing
2561060	2562380	and begin chanting.
2562380	2564240	Tall, we allow the call.
2564240	2566120	Tall, we allow the call.
2566120	2568000	Tall, we allow the call.
2568000	2569720	Tall, we allow the call.
2569720	2574120	The man in the throne of the Santa Claus dressing
2574120	2577080	runs and jumps onto,
2577080	2579760	so there's like a four poster chair
2579760	2582040	for the elf that sits next to him,
2582040	2586520	and he jumps on it with his neck landing directly on,
2586520	2588760	what are those called at the top of like a four poster?
2588760	2589960	Like a spinet?
2589960	2591000	We'll call it a spinet.
2591020	2592020	And if that's not a word,
2592020	2593700	that's what it means now.
2593700	2595140	Post?
2595140	2596380	At the top of a post.
2596380	2600820	What do you call that thing?
2600820	2602140	An uppy pointy,
2603340	2606340	just a straight up and downer.
2606340	2608180	So he jumps on the chair stalagmite.
2608180	2610180	It's like a line, but round.
2612060	2614140	And punctures his own throat
2614140	2616340	and immediately just like,
2616340	2617860	and begins bleeding.
2617860	2619380	Did it look purposeful or accidental?
2619400	2622040	It looked extremely purposeful
2622040	2625760	and the chants get louder from everyone else.
2625760	2626800	Clark, it's your turn.
2626800	2630400	The laptop is in the air and you have made your way there.
2630400	2631280	What do you want to do?
2631280	2632480	I've made my time to her.
2632480	2634900	Yep, she is chanting and no longer,
2636480	2639280	and no longer paying attention to the laptop
2639280	2641560	that is in the air about 20 feet in the air.
2641560	2642680	I don't know how many actions this is,
2642680	2644120	but I'd like to catch the laptop
2644120	2645240	so it doesn't hit the ground,
2645240	2646600	but knock her in the chin.
2646600	2647900	Just see if it clocks her.
2648880	2650320	Is that the way she's throwing it?
2650320	2651160	I could do that, yeah.
2651160	2654860	It'll land directly on her head if you do nothing.
2654860	2655700	Oh, I'll do nothing then.
2655700	2658600	Yeah, if it's coming down on her.
2658600	2659560	Let's see what happens.
2659560	2661560	I'll just see what happens there.
2661560	2664160	I'll let that play out and then I'll see what I do.
2667720	2668920	Oh my God.
2668920	2670780	The laptop comes down in such a way
2670780	2675240	that the most sturdy edge comes down directly on her temple
2675260	2676560	because as she's chanting,
2676560	2679600	she's turning her head to the side completely
2679600	2682540	in this weird like you just said squirrel
2682540	2684180	to a dog kind of way.
2684180	2688300	It hits her directly above the ear in the side of the head
2688300	2690860	and she goes blank, roll luck for me.
2692260	2695380	I'm using new dice that my mom got me for Christmas.
2695380	2697020	Ooh, mama dice.
2697020	2699160	They're good, 54 on a 65.
2699160	2700000	Nice.
2700000	2701340	That will come into play later.
2701340	2703100	Okay, so did it knock her out?
2703100	2704220	It knocked her out cold.
2704240	2706600	Okay, I want to grab the laptop and her
2706600	2708980	and run retreat back to the second floor.
2708980	2711840	Okay, so you can get a hold of them this round,
2711840	2713520	but you won't be able to make it all the way back.
2713520	2715000	You can start your way there.
2715000	2716840	What is Keith Vigna doing?
2716840	2720560	He sees that happen and looks at the people chanting.
2720560	2723640	Are they looking at us or just kind of out of it?
2723640	2726760	They are all staring at one of you.
2726760	2729200	I look at one of the elves and he's staring right at me.
2729200	2730040	Oh yeah.
2730040	2730860	I see down.
2730860	2734040	And he's taken off his ice skating skate.
2734860	2737380	Yeah, I see down about two feet away from me
2737380	2739860	is a candy cane, but the end is sharpened
2739860	2741580	like you're supposed to stick it in your lawn.
2741580	2742420	100%.
2742420	2744820	And I grab it and I spear it right at him.
2745980	2746820	Roll.
2746820	2747660	Roll spear.
2748660	2749820	Roll athletics for me.
2752660	2753540	83 on a 50.
2753540	2757780	You run down the stairs with this sharpened candy cane
2757780	2760720	and you launch it at your elven foe.
2764860	2768140	And it just skies and it lands directly
2768140	2770460	in the head of Frosty the snowman.
2770460	2771300	Do they laugh?
2771300	2772120	And it gets stuck there.
2772120	2773560	So there's a candy cane coming out
2773560	2776060	in between the two button eyes.
2776060	2776900	What are the eyes?
2776900	2777720	Coal.
2777720	2779460	And it goes right into the button nose
2779460	2782420	and the elves die laughing
2782420	2784820	and they're giggling their asses off as they're
2784820	2789660	Tommy Lally Cool, Tommy Lally Cool, Tommy Lally Cool,
2789660	2793620	Tommy Lally Cool, Tommy Lally Cool, wow!
2794200	2795520	Now Zach, are these really Santa's elves
2795520	2798340	or are they just people pretending to be Santa's elves?
2798340	2799180	You don't know.
2800840	2801720	Roll a cult.
2804780	2806020	38 on a 10.
2807760	2809160	Those ears look real, baby.
2811160	2812520	Give one a tug if I can.
2812520	2813900	You can give one a tug if you want
2813900	2816060	cause it's your turn, John Lee Pettymore.
2816060	2817360	What's the naked guy doing?
2817360	2818880	He has put the mop down
2818880	2823280	and he is putting the mop bucket up against the wall
2823820	2827180	and he's beginning to dip his head into the paint
2827180	2828620	that's in this mop bucket.
2828620	2829680	Like you do.
2829680	2830860	Does it bubble up?
2830860	2831700	It's creepy.
2831700	2832520	As he's chanting.
2832520	2833360	He hasn't gotten in there yet.
2833360	2834600	He's still chanting.
2834600	2837600	Twiddle, twiddle, twiddle, twiddle, twiddle, twiddle.
2837600	2840340	Twiddle, twiddle, twiddle, twiddle, twiddle.
2840340	2841400	Well done.
2841400	2842240	Yeah.
2842240	2843060	Thank you.
2843060	2844900	You brought out that big bucket of paint and everything.
2844900	2845740	Yes.
2847180	2848020	And we'll be right back.
2848020	2849500	Yeah, Zach's gonna have to clean off
2849500	2850740	for the next 30 minutes.
2852060	2853100	Just throw some dirt on me.
2853920	2854760	He's in the basement?
2854760	2855600	He is in the basement.
2855600	2856420	Like the lower level?
2856420	2857260	Yes.
2857260	2858100	Okay.
2858100	2858920	So John jumps off the balcony.
2858920	2859760	Yeah.
2859760	2860600	On to him.
2860600	2861420	Awesome.
2861420	2862260	And from the way he jumps,
2862260	2863100	it looks like he thinks he's like,
2863100	2864580	he literally just kind of like steps off.
2866640	2867480	All right.
2867480	2870100	Roll dexterity or athletics, whichever one's higher.
2872040	2874040	65 decks.
2874040	2874880	Five.
2874880	2875720	What do you do?
2875720	2877580	It looks impossible.
2877580	2879320	I don't know if you've ever seen being there.
2879320	2881120	It's very Chauncey Gardner-ish.
2881120	2882920	He literally just like steps off
2883740	2885740	and then you just see his feet moving through the air
2885740	2887100	like he's walking down steps,
2887100	2889060	but very quickly because he's just falling.
2889060	2891520	And then perfectly in his stride,
2891520	2892840	as he steps the foot forward,
2892840	2895860	it like hits, he steps on the naked man's head
2895860	2897500	and it breaks his fall.
2897500	2898740	And he just glides onto the,
2898740	2901620	like walks onto the floor like he meant to do it.
2901620	2902460	Hell yeah.
2902460	2905740	Your foot comes down on this naked man
2905740	2909500	and shoves his head into the bottom of the mop.
2909520	2913760	You stand on the other side with literally no paint on you
2913760	2917280	and turning back around, you just hear
2917280	2922200	doodle doodle doodle, doodle doodle doodle doodle doodle.
2922200	2924000	Since he's literally a fish in the bucket,
2924000	2926840	can I just put my gun up to his head and kill him?
2928200	2929040	Next round.
2930960	2933560	I just mean as a casual afterthought to this round.
2935500	2936340	Donovan.
2936340	2937160	Tell me more.
2937160	2938280	What's been going on here?
2938300	2940580	I don't know, everything started going really crazy,
2940580	2943140	but you know, I just, I try to keep to myself
2943140	2945860	and you know, I just wanna have a good time at school.
2945860	2948740	So I just, you know, just kind of been ignoring all this.
2948740	2950860	You've just been going about your normal business.
2950860	2952980	I mean, have classes been in session at all?
2952980	2956420	I don't go to classes.
2956420	2957500	Is that why you're still here?
2957500	2959780	I do a lot of online classes.
2959780	2960620	Gotcha.
2960620	2962060	But I do live on campus.
2962060	2962900	Okay.
2962900	2963720	For fun.
2963720	2964560	That's kind of sad.
2964560	2966060	But I don't really do much.
2966080	2968560	You know, I always thought I was important,
2968560	2970440	but maybe not this important.
2970440	2971980	Yeah, you weren't.
2971980	2972820	Oh.
2972820	2973980	From what I can tell.
2973980	2974820	Oh, God.
2976500	2978040	Roll for sadness.
2980400	2981240	I'm sad.
2982800	2984520	Kind of unaffected, honestly.
2984520	2985560	Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
2985560	2988720	Donovan's a very like non-emotional human being.
2988720	2989960	Well, let's see if this gets you.
2989960	2992240	So at the end of this round.
2992240	2994120	So wait, is Leon just hanging out with me right now?
2994120	2995120	Like protecting me?
2995120	2995960	Yeah.
2996740	2998380	I'm good with being done talking
2998380	3001340	if you just want to watch what's going on here.
3001340	3002940	Should we shoot at some of these elves?
3002940	3004660	Yeah, I mean, we can if we want.
3004660	3006140	Or you could take some pot shots.
3006140	3008060	Can you tell me how to aim?
3008060	3009300	Like ghost style?
3009300	3011380	Yeah, I'll show you how to aim.
3011380	3012460	Oh, no.
3012460	3014620	Go ahead and roll firearms with a plus 20
3014620	3019380	as he puts his hands on over your hands.
3019380	3020500	From behind.
3020500	3022180	And ghosts your gun.
3022180	3025780	And you just can feel him smell you.
3025780	3027840	Oh.
3027840	3029160	Stop plus 40.
3035920	3037640	Crip fail.
3037640	3038480	A 99.
3038480	3039360	It's not a Crip, but it's.
3039360	3040560	Oh, I thought it was a 66.
3040560	3041920	Oh, it's a 96.
3041920	3044280	Nevermind, just a regular fail.
3044280	3045920	Well, if 69 is a Crip success,
3045920	3047280	should 96 be a Crip fail?
3050920	3052120	Not this time,
3052120	3054400	but that would be an interesting house rule to add.
3054400	3055240	Let's add it.
3055700	3056540	96.
3056540	3058380	Fuck, I know I'm gonna be the next person to roll one
3058380	3060900	in like two months when I don't fucking remember
3060900	3061740	this at all.
3061740	3063140	Head to toe, back to back.
3063140	3065820	So Leon steps to the side and is like,
3065820	3068620	yeah, okay, that was pretty good, but more like this.
3068620	3071080	And then he just, he actually looks at you.
3071080	3074180	He makes direct eye contact with you while he fires,
3074180	3077100	takes one of the elves out and then he turns back.
3077100	3080120	No, he continues looking at you and he's like,
3080120	3080960	did I get him?
3081740	3085400	You're really scary.
3087060	3087900	You're a scary guy.
3087900	3089940	Yes, I am.
3089940	3093180	But I am impressed and that almost never happens.
3093180	3094020	I'll take it.
3094020	3099020	So the Santa Claus that is left completely wraps his head
3099080	3102900	up in duct tape and then falls to the ground.
3102900	3106880	The lady climbing up jumps for the disco ball
3106880	3108540	that's in the middle of the room.
3109540	3114320	Misses and falls face first into,
3114320	3116920	I'm gonna say, let's see, she lands.
3116920	3119920	Oh yeah, her crumpled body lands directly
3119920	3122320	on the Santa Claus's throne.
3122320	3126300	It's like her head landed in the spot where the back
3126300	3127880	of your butt is.
3127880	3130960	So it like kind of goes into the seat,
3130960	3132800	like where you lose change and stuff.
3132800	3135280	And the rest of her body just like kind of splits
3135300	3139720	and crumbles on the sides around either arm of the chair.
3140600	3143900	The three elves, two of which are dead,
3143900	3145180	the very, oh no, sorry.
3145180	3149220	The two elves that are left take off their skates completely
3149220	3153660	and slit their own throats with their ice skates.
3153660	3158660	Blood sprays onto the ice as the elves continue laughing,
3159420	3164420	each ha overpowered by the sound of the gurgling.
3165300	3170300	And the man in the mop continues to,
3176260	3179180	and Clark looking over at the girl throwing the laptop
3179180	3182100	up in the air, you see her.
3182100	3184180	She's in my arms unconscious.
3184180	3186780	You feel her breathe out
3190480	3192380	and then not breathe back in.
3192800	3196120	Oh, who's around me right now?
3196120	3197400	Bad guys, anybody?
3197400	3198640	Everyone is dead.
3198640	3200640	I don't think there's necessarily bad guys,
3200640	3203040	but the people who cause mental harm.
3203040	3205480	We shot them like they were.
3205480	3210480	I'm the only one trying to pull over.
3235480	3240480	Oh, how can you have enough drowning out all alone?
3247100	3251100	There's nobody home, no one home, no one home.
3259320	3261400	Fly to fly to the stream.
