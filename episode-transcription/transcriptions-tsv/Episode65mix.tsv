0	5600	Mike Smith here. Thank you again for joining us during our pledge drive this week.
5600	14320	You've just heard Under the Mulberry Tree with Mary Ann Kellans and we're about to get into
14320	23280	into a classic episode of our Smash It! Surprise, surprise Smash It!
24240	31620	Not everyone around here was rooting for this show but by god it's it's really
31620	41240	taken off. It's of course pretending to be people. An unlikely hit for 694.2
41240	51360	but but a hit nonetheless. I'm joined here today by Nyle Leota who...
51360	58680	Nyle Leota Oda. Nyle Leota I'm not gonna say the last that can't be your... Nyle Leota
58680	68320	Oda who who has come here and joined her. As you know me Mike Smith I've been at
68320	73680	this station for 35 years ever since I graduated from community college here in
73680	82360	contention and you know for a long time things were kind of done Mike's way but
82360	88960	Nyle has come in with with his uh you know his big city ideas. Listeners may
88960	96040	remember me from my show with my ex-wife over on KITI in the city. No one
96040	103200	listens to city radio. And I'm back here in contention under some interesting
103200	107360	circumstances but I've got a lot of great ideas to shake up the way things
107360	115760	we do here at 694.2 PTBP. Now you're from here right Nyle? I am yes. And you were you had a
115760	121640	you had a I understand a successful public radio career in the city. I did
121640	129640	indeed. Until you were... until I came back to contention to bring my fantastic pieces to
129640	135440	694.2 PTBP. You didn't you didn't have a successful marriage advice show with
135440	139800	your wife and then you got divorced. And then let's talk about how our listeners
139800	147560	can support us during this pledge drive week Mike. As as you know Nyle has
147560	153200	brought pretending to be people to our to our station and he's brought with it
153200	161120	a something called a Patreon. Patreon.com slash pretending pod. Thanks Nyle. You're
161120	169280	welcome Mike. You know Nyle public radio to me is it's responsible reporting
169280	173800	twice a day you've got your morning edition and you're all things considered
173800	180320	and then in between you know in a small town you got a lot of time for a
180400	186960	traditional Celtic music for bluegrass for jazz we didn't have a lot of you
186960	194880	know fancy gunplay cop shows going on in this town before you got here but then
194880	198120	you brought us a little something called pretending to be people and people just
198120	204760	love it. Yes Mike. Don't they Mike? I believe that grass should be green like the color of money
204760	209480	speaking of which we've got a patreon at patreon.com slash pretending pod now I
209560	214080	want to say some new things to bring to that patreon don't you I do there's
214080	219720	currently a five dollar tier there and we've got some fantastic supporters at
219720	224560	that five dollar tier currently called honorary police officers I'd like to
224560	228520	give a quick shout out to three of those honorary police officers right now
228520	235760	Sasha S Brian C and Jasmine J thank you all so much for listening and
235760	243360	contributing to making sure that we can keep making PTBP at 694.2 with
243360	248200	pretending to be people thank you very much to everyone who has supported the
248200	252080	station and will continue to support it throughout this pledge drive so the
252080	257200	changes let's get into those are right off the bat here first off that five
257200	263320	dollar tier is no longer going to be called honorary police officers at five
263360	268760	dollars you'll still get the bonus content on a monthly basis but the name
268760	275600	has changed from honorary police officers to splashylvania fastpass
275600	280920	holder so if I'm getting this right everyone who was currently an honorary
280920	287800	police officer will be a splashylvania fastpass holder isn't that fun and I'm
287840	296800	also here to introduce not only the $10 tier but also a $15 tier and a $30 tier
296800	304480	but we're not stopping there we're also adding both a 50 and even a $100 tier to
304480	309760	keep this sinking boat afloat you think people are gonna pay $100 for your shitty
309760	315460	little again this is Nile Liotta Oda at 694.2 PTBP let's go ahead and
315500	319020	introduce this first clip from an old classic episode of pretending to be
319020	324300	people as you all know during pledge drives we like to play classic episodes
324300	330640	of your favorite public radio content and then interrupt them incessantly to
330640	335380	the point where they're essentially incoherent you just get a little bit and
335380	340860	then ten minutes of two assholes talking maybe just one and now let's cut to a
340860	346220	clip from an episode the listeners voted on as their favorite episode of

589300	595540	is an hour of bluegrass we won't get each week that brings us down to
595540	600100	approximately 12 hours of bluegrass a day which I personally think is the
600100	604460	right amount of bluegrass for our listeners on all of the polls that we've
604460	609060	done yeah you haven't gone down to to Joe's coffee and ask the people there

626940	632660	fantastic contention businesses with owners like Duncan Hole do you want a
632660	638900	laugh line there Nile pretending to public radio is a damn I'm sorry folks
638900	644460	public radio is a responsibility Nile it's not cheap entertainment it's not
645100	651380	it's not cops you know it's not America's most wanted it's jazz and
651380	659180	bluegrass damn it at least it isn't in this state it's okay intern if we could
659180	664620	get some tissues in here for Mike I'm fine I'm fine why don't you tell us
664620	669900	about your patreon tears absolutely I would be very excited to do that so
669900	676860	let's wipe away some of those te ars tears and get hyped up for some new TI
676860	684860	er s tears over on patreon.com slash pretending pod just to reiterate if you
684860	691420	are currently pledged at $5 a month the only change is your name as a
691420	697300	splashylvania fast pass holder you will still have access to the exclusive
697340	703060	monthly bonus content in the form of an audio episode what happened to the title
703060	708740	of honorary police officer you ask well we thought it was a better fit for the
708740	716540	rewards offered in our brand-new $10 tier now patrons who pledged $10 a month
716540	722580	become honorary police officers and will not only have access to the exclusive
722620	729380	monthly bonus content but they will also have the opportunity to submit the name
729380	737420	and description of an NPC and a location these submissions will be drawn at
737420	742260	random and used in the show pretending to be people well now Nile normally we
742260	747720	don't agree but it makes a lot of sense for the people who get to participate to
747720	752540	be honorary police officers and for that to move to the $10 tier instead of the
752540	757140	$5 tier thank you so much for saying that Mike it's maybe the one good idea
757140	762700	you've ever had oh that brings joy to my heart and with joy I'd like to move on
762700	769660	and tell you about the $15 tier at patreon.com slash pretending pod people
769660	778740	who pledge $15 a month will join the den of sin that sounds inappropriate now
778740	784980	Nile tell me what that is people who pledge at the $15 level will have access
784980	790860	to a monthly live stream of the pretending to be people crew recording
790860	797700	their patreon bonus content and that will include a hangout after for about
797700	802140	an hour hour and a half who knows how long it could go and they'll be playing
802140	809300	games answering questions it's going to be a bonafide uncanny hootenanny a
809300	814220	binging shindig for those of you who want a behind-the-scenes look at the
814220	819020	process or who'd want to kick it with the pretending to be people crew this

1016980	1023660	the red light coming down on all of you and Oh right above your heads you see
1023660	1031220	that there is what seems to be a gauge that is a red light slowly blinking and
1031220	1036300	each time it blinks it is lowering so it's like a battery power pack or
1036300	1040740	something that is lowering and lit in the room the only thing in this room is
1040740	1048220	a pedestal with a big red button on top and the light above you with each blink
1048220	1067740	is going okay I ripped the gauge out of the year you all remember gauging I was
1067740	1072380	at a show one time and I was standing right behind this dude who had huge
1072380	1078300	gauges and this kid just walked up with a padlock and just hooked it on this
1078300	1085580	dude's ear and ran away and the guy just chased him I will fill you in on this
1085580	1093820	they're not called gauges the gauge is the size of them yeah we all fucking know
1093820	1099860	Keith Vigna pulls out his sidearm and shoots the thing that's beeping
1099860	1103980	immediately all of your ears start ringing and nothing in the room
1103980	1108740	lightwise has changed the meter is still lowering but none of you can hear

1180900	1184940	beeping well what if hey guys what if we let the button go down to the bottom and
1184940	1188860	instead of some of the bad happenings the door opens Jedidiah is at the
1188860	1195500	back door just trying to open it back up and he's like Jedidiah is this not your
1195500	1202560	trailer yeah so it is but you forgot okay well Clark is gonna go look at the
1202560	1206440	gauge more closely is it is it demarcated in any way is it is that the
1206440	1209520	right word demarcated does it have markings on it that indicate levels or
1209520	1215440	numbers or anything that's a great word Joe no it is simply just like just let
1215440	1221000	up the lights go back to the top and did you say it was coming out of the ceiling
1221000	1225320	yes it's coming out of the ceiling can I follow it to the top and see if it runs
1225320	1234120	to anything like a like a like a conduit go ahead and roll search it was
1234120	1238840	it was coming out of the ceiling but then I chased it in a rant fail 81 on a
1238840	1244480	20 as you're like trying to find some sort of connection between the two you
1244480	1249760	kind of trip backwards in the mostly darkness and press the button again
1249760	1254240	attaboy Clark that's what I was just trying to make sure want to make sure we
1254240	1256160	kept the button pressed that's all I was doing
1256160	1260360	Keith Vigna looks around is there anything in this trailer no it is
1260360	1266040	completely empty except for the big red button and five idiots Keith Keith you
1266040	1269640	know it's your first day why don't you go ahead and press the button yeah we'll
1269640	1272560	let you press this one but why don't you press that button press that button I
1272560	1278080	stand there button and I grab his hand and start edging it towards I don't want
1278080	1282180	to press the button but I do want to make a good impression on my new
1282180	1289060	co-workers yeah so I go up to the button and I have my hand about like a
1289060	1297780	couple inches away from it and I go and just press it a bunch of times each time
1297780	1301580	it beeps and each time light goes right back to the top Keith we said you could
1301580	1305540	press the button once can I see anything else in this room if I maybe go past the
1305540	1309680	button as you pass the button you're not sure if you walking over there triggered
1309680	1317720	this or if it just started but you feel your socks are wet and looking down you
1317720	1322960	can't quite tell if it's the red from the light or whether the liquid is red
1322960	1334840	that is slowly rising in this room and you're all stepping in a red viscous

1388040	1394000	Mike it's good to see ya obviously who Floyd now it's probably a little earlier
1394040	1397800	than you're used to being here I reckon there's a whole bunch of your audience
1397800	1401960	that don't even know who I am haha yeah hey you know they tend to they
1401960	1406720	tend to they tend to hit the sack early it can get pretty lonely here being here
1406720	1409720	that late I hear you guys pitter-pattering outside the door but
1409720	1413440	nobody ever comes in to say hey we're not here when you're here I've literally
1413440	1422200	never been here oh I hear you're no easy it's very anti public radio ethos the
1422400	1426560	spirit of the effort we're all putting into this but Niles only here from nine
1426560	1430480	to five well I guess it's the janitor crew or something the janitor crew I
1430480	1434960	believe we had to cut due to costs so the trash is always empty every time I'm
1434960	1438120	in here I'll just figure that's the janitor crew and the floors are all
1438120	1442020	sopping wet and oh well you can tell they're brushing their mops against the
1442020	1445720	walls there's scratches all over the walls I try and if I see him
1445720	1449880	exterminators must have been slacking on the job or something I don't what do you
1449880	1454240	mean like a creatures getting in at night or it's here all the time you're
1454240	1458640	the only creature that gets in here at night buddy from the hours of seven to
1458640	1462840	nine obviously they do call me the creature I think you should have gotten
1462840	1468080	the memo that we do no longer have trash service you are supposed to be taking
1468080	1471940	your own trash out each night I haven't I haven't been is but it's so well it's
1471940	1475760	all family here so somebody's probably picking up your slack now why don't you

1581600	1590800	of our current patrons hello there to Torin Linus B and Sam T thank you all so
1590800	1598080	much for pledging your support to PT BP 6 9 4.2 and pretending to be people yes
1598080	1605840	thank you Sam T for supporting you know this new little show that's on our our
1605840	1610360	radio station instead of every other thing we put out for you 24 hours a day
1610360	1618320	that that's got a that's got a strong sound to it I like I like that fella now
1618320	1624680	Floyd you were talking about something strange going on here in the station do
1624680	1628480	you want to elaborate on that for our listeners here well it just seems to me
1628480	1635040	we don't want Mike if you interrupt him for once do we want listeners knowing
1635040	1639560	about I think that the listeners would be very glad to know that they are every
1639560	1645600	dollar you donate to this station will go to an unhaunted radio station it's
1645600	1650560	not haunted like people are saying well we might be able to afford a janitorial
1650560	1655000	staff if we get enough money and some of these issues might be resolved you said
1655000	1658880	the floors were wet it's it's told me for a loop here that you're telling me
1658880	1663920	that the the janitors are not doing their jobs lately because they're gone
1663920	1668200	there we we had to fire them because of no money but it's not haunted but
1668200	1671840	everything is so it's like they spilled their mop buckets in some of the carpets
1671840	1677200	here and there and the floors are shiny and bright like they've been picked
1677200	1684600	clean you are a late-night DJ maybe some of your you know exuberant habits
1684600	1688320	between the hours of seven and nine
1690560	1695840	that's the tornado drill that's just the the local tornado drill sirens those
1695840	1699560	happen randomly throughout the day at all times that did not sound like a
1699920	1706680	no no no no now you see at 8 a.m. is it on top of the station they do the
1706680	1711920	tornado siren drills at Wednesdays at 8 a.m. and then also just randomly
1711920	1717000	throughout the week and now back to our classic fan favorite episode of
1717000	1721640	pretending to be people entitled can I just say before before we get back to
1721640	1727400	your nonsense it is unconscionable to suggest that the radio station is
1727400	1732240	haunted by any kind of those kinds of assumptions might be your downfall Mike
1732240	1737320	back to the episode Keith's first day
1738960	1744600	Lindsay Manstein looks down the barrel of their gun at this little green man
1744600	1750240	Ames pulls the trigger roll firearms
1750240	1756120	hell yeah that's a crit success baby no way oh shit okay roll 2d 10 for damage
1756120	1767640	the same thing you just rolled fuck off I got another another crit success 22
1767640	1774160	22 so actually we're poor damage is weirdly enough when you fire a bullet
1774200	1780560	into this tiny little green man you just obliterate him but looking out all
1780560	1787680	around the first Church of contention sanctuary you see you've got 45 more to
1787680	1794440	go exactly I look over at Keith big na big na sack up let's do this as soon as
1794440	1800600	I hear that I pull the shotgun off of my back
1801440	1808800	you fight four times yeah okay into the crowd of alien okay have Keith roll
1808800	1817920	firearms at a negative negative 40 I've got a 70 within that's a fail all right
1817920	1822720	so you just blast in and they're all like literally like jumping and four of
1822720	1827960	them that you aim at actually each time you aim at one they jump on to the top
1827960	1832120	head of the one next to them and then like the next one you aim at jumps on
1832120	1836400	top of the second one and they create this like wizard staff of small green
1836400	1841920	alien man so I had stand I hit none of them and each time they jump on top of
1841920	1846800	each other they're like and then when they're all on top they like pogo stick
1846800	1856640	away I have unloaded my shotgun and hit no one and therefore it's no longer your
1856640	1863720	turn and so yeah I take my time to put some more shotgun shells and not pay
1863720	1867360	attention to where they're going John Lee Pettymore what are you doing John
1867360	1873560	gets down on one knee oh yeah and he he takes his he takes his gun and he he
1873560	1879680	aims his service pistol at each one of those four little fucking brains on that
1879680	1885000	pogo stick and he's like die you alien scum and he pulls the trigger
1885200	1894360	firearms baby that's a crit success holy shit okay that'll take out three of
1894360	1899840	them so as they're like pogoing away from you you take out the top three and
1899840	1906400	all of their like green splatter just like falls into the baptism pool at the
1906400	1911480	top of the like sanctuary on the other side of the podium where every Sunday
1911480	1918680	pastor Adam Kane gives his sermons and with that it is all of the aliens turn
1918680	1927000	and they all start at the same time and it grows and grows and the power sends a
1927000	1931840	sound wave like a shock through all of your bodies I need everyone to roll
1931840	1942240	power I pass a 6 on a 60 oh nice I pass a 12 on a 50 well done I pass a 28 on a
1942240	1951320	65 rare I fail a 58 on a 50 medium rare you dumb dumb so in that exact moment
1951320	1958600	Lindsey Manstein you feel your brain begin to compress and like pulse you
1958600	1967600	lose let's roll of dice six damage as you feel liquid come out of your left
1967600	1974880	and right ears and you feel up there you feel up your face and there's blood just
1974880	1980920	dripping from your ears I look at Clark and I'm like Clark I don't feel so good
1980920	1985200	Clark Bishop it's your turn I want to line up a shot that takes out as many of
1985200	1990680	them in a row as I can straight through these squishy gringo I like that like
1990680	1994320	they're still stacked on top of each other not all of the room is full of
1994320	2002920	these guys yeah full of little fellas angles all right so roll intelligence to
2002920	2010520	find the right angle to shoot at first I pass a 52 on a 55 all right now roll
2010520	2019680	firearms straight up and down to take out as many of them as possible I don't
2019680	2024520	know I think it kind of added to the whole podcast
2024880	2035840	Zach that's a 22 oh my god he's not even lying about our special issue living in
2035840	2044000	some sort of weird gravity in this room like okay roll 2d 10 a 9 and a 3 holy
2044000	2049120	shit okay so 12 knock out three of them so you've got this lineup of three of
2049120	2054260	them in your sights there's like one on a pew one on the lectern and then one
2054260	2058720	hanging from a the Christian flag you know have you guys ever seen the
2058720	2064040	Christian flag I've seen the methodist flag not the Christian flag every church
2064040	2068400	that I like went to growing up had the American flag right next to the
2068400	2074840	Christian flag a very very strange choice of idols so one is hanging down
2074840	2080040	and the flag just bus and like it's almost like a like an ink package and
2080040	2085080	ink cartridge from like a money bag that you would steal a robbing and it just
2085080	2091700	banking bus this like green guck all over the flag and as soon as the flag
2091700	2097220	has been tarnished you see the stained glass at the very front of the sanctuary
2097220	2104700	just erupts into tiny tiny little particles of different colored glass all
2104700	2110580	making up some fucked up white Jesus holding a lamb and it just dissipates
2110580	2117980	into nothing as this massive version of these tiny little green men that you've
2117980	2123580	seen all over here this one stands at least two stories tall and it lowers its
2123580	2131580	head to crawl into the sanctuary of the first church of contention
