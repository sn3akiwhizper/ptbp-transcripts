465680	467040	sometimes i just edit that out
469760	473280	thomas were you on the call when i was talking about the product for the commercial shoot i
473280	479760	did today no i'm not going to say the name of it but it's a wearable hand sanitizer and lotion
479760	488080	dispenser that goes around your wrist cool and it looks like a giant cock ring awesome all of
488080	496720	those things are cool the pot it's like pods full of one is full of lotion and the other one is full
496720	503680	of hand sanitizer and they're on either side of your wrist it's a two inch long pod so your wrist
503680	512160	is now a solid what seven eight inches wide uh-huh but at any time you can just be like
512160	516960	so you could be walking through the park and somebody offers you a hot dog and you say oh

521840	530960	dog real quick it squirts out like one of those like uh gel deodorant sticks that you just kind
531040	536400	of like squeeze out through holes on the top of it that's exactly what it looks like as it squeezes
536400	542240	out so walk me through okay you you've you've pushed the pouch and it's squirted do you take
542240	547760	your other hand and rub is that how it works so the hand that you are squeezing with it just kind
547760	557760	of like stays on the product and then you rub off the lotion it was honestly one of the most batshit
557760	563040	things i've ever seen i was like this is a joke right you gotta build up your imdb
563040	567360	credits though yeah instead of getting paid i just just like can i have 10 of them
571040	574480	i should have asked for one instead of getting paid that would have been that would have been
574480	583360	fun i could put cool stuff in it mayonnaise and mustard oh my god then you could get a sandwich
583360	589520	going anytime anywhere i like where your head's at that's exactly what you'd use it for
589520	597120	that's great mine would be sriracha and uh freddy's fry salt into it gooped up in there
597120	603200	what's their it's their it's their fry and steak burger seasoning oh it's real good a season a
603200	611280	seasoning salt does that have delicious seasonings in it yes i'll throw some cheese whiz in mine

616880	619760	i would just turn mine both of them into a chia pet
621760	628720	seriously though uh home tip you can buy their fucking uh their burger and fry seasoning at the
628720	633520	at the restaurants you can probably order it online but if you're making burgers at home
634080	640000	just toss in some fucking uh freddy's seasoning with your meat and like you're gonna blast
640640	646400	everybody's burgers away nice season you're meeting then you're gonna blast is all
648960	656000	what comp is this a competition or are is all grilling a competition yes yes no see but that's

663840	666080	whoa who both live in canada
670000	678320	wow thomas is really cool over the summer but then he comes back and it's like
678320	686720	he's blasting on our burgers don't blast on my burg bro so the four of you the five of you what
686720	692880	is the name uh all all old western groups have a have a cool name right the magnificent seven
693440	698480	others i'm sure those are usually applied afterwards i think the fucking four
700480	706080	fast and the four yes well that's it there are five of us here does he
708080	714720	yeah custom i mean not that i do associate with this group yet but hypothetically if there was
714720	720800	one would would you count really i feel like i'm the leader honestly he's been with us the whole
720800	727520	time that's interesting that's i mean clearly uh clearly the judge is the alpha i think we were all
727520	733360	looking at every pace to take control of this group at any point now if if bobby's part of
733360	740320	the group we could be the fab five i don't understand the reference it just made it up
742400	749760	the fab five it is professor you're gonna have to learn to be more oh i missed the joke fuck
749760	756160	i'll hear it when i edit i just i just we're the fab we're the fab five where's the fab five
757680	759040	that's that's not a joke
761600	768160	and with that we're back into the reality is the 1880 some things with a burp from judge ephraim
768720	776320	courtland the five of you are surveying from a distance the land bobby's from missouri
776320	782800	nice i served him once yeah oh he's cool yeah preacher sheriff bobby custard not you
785120	795200	uh you see that the gay man from the future new the typically bustling new mine is a ghost town
795920	800240	normally men and women who work for coals contention mining company would be hustling
800240	806080	about up and down stairs from platform to platform hauling loads of equipment with
806080	813360	the conveyor continuously running a loud humming and the thick stench of sweat in the air today
813360	822800	however it's quiet except for those same low barking growls that you heard earlier and there
822880	831760	is a swarm i'm talking 12. is that a swarm is that enough for swarm 12 vultures
831760	836320	is a lot of vultures observe everyone a small swarm of vultures
839440	845280	you see him around here quite a bit lots of death and whatnot is it inherently weird to us that the
845280	851920	mine isn't operating today or is it it is is it a known thing always in operation maybe they're
851920	860400	installing fans in the mine that'd be awful nice of him i ain't known silas coal to be particularly
860400	866400	worried about being nice to folks that's true he did steal my copper wire i don't know he he
866400	872000	he does a lot for well even the courthouse you know got electricity before i guess it might have
872000	878480	gotten stolen but we don't exactly know by whom except for miss kitty lizzie said it was his wife
879440	886000	the little girl she said it was mary cole yeah you were right there didn't you hear i was right
886000	892800	there huh let's go get her we can find out about the smashed watermelons or whatever but i need to
892800	897440	get my wire i think we should probably stay the course to find the grave robbing miss kitty at
897440	902480	this point that's that's kind of top priority we don't want any more graves dug up yeah i think
902800	910240	your wire comes a second here afram judge why don't why don't we tie everything up uh later on
910240	915280	in the day with your wire yeah well i figured if we were heading down there i'd bring it up but
915280	922160	should we follow these horse tracks or the tracks do lead back down through the gate of the mine
922800	927840	uh into the property that the coals own i'd like to go down there and touch this goo
927840	936960	and you see that at the gate at his daily post is the mining company's security guard becker
936960	945440	piston you know becker was a co-worker of silas coal down in the mine but when silas bought the
945440	951520	mine he pulled becker up out of the ground sat him at that gate and he's been there ever since
952160	958640	becker piston lives on the grounds far on the other side of the mine from the coal residence
958640	965360	so basically one far end becker piston lives and you got the mine in the middle and then far on the
965360	971920	other side you've got the residents of the coals and over the top of the entrance of the mine
972480	979360	silas has built a three-story building with his office are we writing up to him
980320	987760	oh that's up to you guys how do you would we know if becker is uh typically a violent person
987760	992800	or anything or like unreasonable or do we just not would we not have known him in our day-to-day
992800	1001360	goings-ons going awnings is going awnings the word uh he is one of the chillest people
1001360	1007440	that has ever existed not a lot bad happens around the mine silas runs a really tight ship
1008000	1013920	and everyone gets paid on time he takes care of his employees and he takes care of the town at
1013920	1021760	large and you know becker to be a glazed over chill are the tracks that we're following are
1021760	1027120	they leading into the mine they are leading onto the property you wouldn't be able to
1027120	1034080	quite trace where they are once they where are the vultures circling they're circling over the
1034080	1039200	coal residents hey judge and uh custard we should try and get onto this here property
1039200	1044480	don't you think i think old uh old becker would uh i think he'll be cool with it
1044480	1049760	yeah he ought to be uh we got a warrant wink wink let's go
1054000	1055520	took a quick suckle of a teat
1058400	1060480	so we go to the property
1060480	1063280	i am

1106560	1115200	legal uh yeah of course we are i mean i don't know approves of it by and large at this point

1183360	1188160	and like spit a little chew down at his feet hand it over
1190240	1197440	and becker piston's eyes very large just slowly hand trembling
1198240	1207280	reaches into his vest pocket and pulls out a small little bottle uh can you not take it all
1207920	1215520	because this is i get out a uh pre-rolled cigarette and like drip the opium all over it
1216160	1219120	and then hand him and hand him the bottle back
1220880	1226240	professor green snatches it in mid pass and takes a dropper of it
1228240	1235680	every time there's drugs in the role-playing game everybody wants to do if you if you if
1235680	1242960	you'll remember it's my idea to do your drugs first you get the credit then i just wanted us
1242960	1249520	to hit all errors after i do that i light the cigarette up and take a few drags and then kind
1249520	1255360	of like hand it reach over to horace you know i don't agree with you about much but i do agree
1255360	1264000	with you about um well you know uh roughing up this old opium fiend for his stash as he's smoking
1264000	1271360	the cigarette i like take a few pulls from my flask and it's like dribbling down my chin i'm
1271360	1278320	like i declined the flask but i pass it on to the group along with the cigarette
1279760	1287120	oh interesting uh preacher sheriff bobby custard passes the cigarette oh were you not gonna give
1288000	1294640	hora sees him go for that and he's like he he remembers that all right you're in the fab five
1297040	1303280	so he starts to yank it away and then reluctantly he's like all right well he just passes the
1303280	1309680	cigarette immediately back to ever at pace and takes a drag off the flask uh ever it's gonna
1309680	1318320	take the cigarette and and look at it kind of funny huh okay i gave the stuff up a while here
1318320	1326080	here you go jack uh which wait i i'm a medical doctor more or less it will uh it will calm your
1326080	1330640	nerves i don't i don't have any nerves preacher sheriff doctor kind of ticks his head to the side
1330640	1337040	oh oh as much as you oh as much as you custard i make all my important decisions on this stuff
1337120	1339920	i don't have any nerves yeah
1342320	1350080	jack pearlman's gonna take just the the tiniest drag off the drag yeah bill clinton drag off the
1350080	1355280	the cigarette since he's been losing a little sanity he figures something to help calm his
1355280	1361040	nerves a little bit but not a lot because he's not his vices is alky hall and then he takes he
1361040	1365920	takes a big old pull off the flask though but he wipes it first because he thinks it's nasty
1365920	1372160	because it is it is it's nasty every pace go ahead and roll listen for me
1375200	1383920	i pass a 25 on a 40 okay uh everybody else take your headphones off nothing happens
1385920	1388240	you listen and listen and there's nothing
1388240	1398400	except for dumbasses doing drugs making their characters a little bit less effective
1408080	1411920	every pace you're listening well you're just you're just sitting there but well during this
1411920	1420160	whole conversation about passing the drugs and doing the drugs and everything you hear from the
1420160	1429040	home of the coals some sort of spat two voices being raised back and forth and then with that
1429040	1435040	successful listen check you hear you can just make it out it's just traveling on the wind
1435280	1442720	just enough to reach your ears are you here silas cole say yeah i said it's it's fine
1443920	1452480	i know how to handle it i know how to handle her she's out just trust me i know how to handle her
1452480	1460640	or it i know how to handle it i know how to handle her okay she's out just trust me
1460800	1465120	just trust me okay that's all
1473840	1478960	hey hey everybody quiet down quiet down let the coals they're they're fighting about something
1478960	1483200	over there's something going on over at the coal house i don't know how the listen check works if
1483200	1490320	i do if i point that out can they all hear it then can he share his with us oh we can
1490560	1497440	we just make checks or uh no however at this exact moment the door of the coal residence
1498800	1507360	opens and you see silas cole roughed up hair huge pants wearing a belt and suspenders
1508320	1518640	carrying a rug over his shoulder and he lugs it into the back of his wagon
1518640	1527280	one of his wagons here on the coal property and he begins unhinging his horses and preparing them
1527920	1538960	for a trip and i'm gonna roll to see and uh he goes about his business slowly and steady-handedly
1538960	1543440	oh shit fellas i think there might be i think there might be somebody in that rug i heard him
1543440	1549120	say i heard him say that he he had handled it and and he knew how to handle her and that she was out
1549120	1552320	and i didn't know what that meant but what if he meant that she was knocked out what if she's in
1552320	1561360	that rug i believe that that theory is plausible mr pace judge sheriff should we yeah should we
1562720	1569680	i say confront ourselves should we confront him now or i say any excuse to string that
1569680	1576800	boy but judge he is the reason that this town is what it is if we get rid of silas cole
1576800	1582880	contention is nothing you're gonna get him let him get away with murder well we get at least i mean
1583760	1588720	we could talk to him before we're done hanging by a rope well i wasn't gonna hang him before
1588720	1593360	we find out who would kill i didn't say he killed anybody i think she might just be knocked out

1650400	1655680	bringing her back into town as we speak maybe we should go ask about that in a rug i mean if
1655680	1662320	he's doing something that's okay we get to talk to him and feel him out see if he's nervous you

2179680	2186640	i aim the gun at him and he's like whoa i'm just adjusting my thing and i go sure and just right
2186640	2191840	onto his face a big like i haven't drank water only whiskey recently so it's just a thick
2192720	2202240	whiskey chewing tobacco blob just sticks to his forehead uh yeah go ahead and roll a d6
2202240	2207760	and we'll see if it's a one two or three he'll be disabled for one round if it's a four five
2207760	2218800	six he's disabled for two rounds five two rounds uh fucking thick ass glob just covers both his eyes
2220320	2227200	fill him with lead boys and can i just stumble can i jump off my horse backwards
2227760	2234560	and no fuck you no great turn you did stay on your horse i'm telling a story
2237760	2244160	he stumbles backwards and his hand comes off of his holster and he just falls through his knees
2244160	2251280	and begins collecting dirt from the ground and trying to get the the juices out of his
2251280	2259920	eyes and he's just like oh it burns preacher sheriff dr bobby custard hops off of his horse
2260720	2270240	and grabs a pair of shackles from his side bag and begins approaching silas cole and it is everett
2270240	2278000	pace's turn he's gonna he's gonna hold out his hands to bobby custard help me down help me down
2284480	2289600	the reason that preacher sheriff dr bobby custard couldn't get all the way to putting the
2290080	2299920	shackles onto silas cole is because he turned around halfway and helps everett pace off of
2299920	2307680	bucky i put you up there it would be a shame if i didn't help you down it just go quicker is all
2309040	2313520	i want to if i can move around to toward the back of the wagon toward the carpet
2313520	2317920	yeah uh you can get to the back of the carpet and when you get there
2317920	2326000	you see in the bottom of this rug that has been rolled up a pair of shoes and the tread
2326640	2333360	of these shoes is something you've never seen before first off they're like kind of white-ish
2333360	2339840	tread and that's just not a thing and there's a logo on the bottom of them which you've never seen
2339840	2353520	before a little thing that says est 1949 roll intelligence i pass a six on a 60 then that
2353520	2363440	means you get to roll sanity oh shit oh yeah i'm good at that i pass 14 on an 80 what do you
2363440	2366720	tell yourself she got weird shoes nailed it
2372480	2378400	jack promen you're up uh i'm gonna be making my way towards uh the down
2386320	2390080	i thought you were frozen i was trying to do it was perfect
2394000	2404240	no i'm going towards silas cole with gun held on like the the holding onto the pistol no actually
2404240	2407920	you know what fuck it i have the rifle out at this point but i'm not aiming it at him i'm just
2407920	2414800	holding it while walking towards him menacingly yeah yeah uh because i want to help subdue him
2414800	2421520	basically not hurt him sure horse green you're a blast sorry professor horse green thank you
2423440	2434160	horse horse gets off the horse and um draws his pistol on silas cole and like unsteadily walks up
2436080	2441840	to support everybody else but it's not he's he's not trying to get into it he barely looks like
2441840	2449840	he's held a pistol before judge uh i get down off my horse and i want to aid the sheriff in
2449840	2455280	blocking him up or shackling him or whatever he was doing okay silas cole is continuing to try to
2455280	2464400	try to get this dirt on his eyes but he is still second round of this horrible can i add something
2464400	2472240	to what how i help yeah i just want to push him down okay so preacher sheriff dr bobby custard
2472240	2480080	and judge f from courtland walk up behind silas cole and the judge six foot ten puts one of his
2480080	2488160	big ass boots on the back of silas cole and just silas hits the ground and immediately preacher
2488160	2496240	sheriff dr bobby custard is on top throw shackles on his wrists behind his back grabs the back of
2496240	2503840	his shirt and lifts him back up so he is on his knees and he is shackled pace it's evert's turn
2503840	2508560	fellas we got a body our suspicions confirmed there's a body rolled up in this carpet back here
2508560	2513120	and somebody somebody come help me pull it out is it kitty i don't know i just see i just see the

2544160	2551520	science experiments all over town just blending in
2555440	2563840	actually it looks come to think of it it's this old revolver uh it's like got wood on the sides
2563840	2566880	and this like big ass cylinder
2567120	2567600	oh
2570880	2577200	oh no nothing else strange about it just a big cylinder on this motherfucker fucking dope
2579600	2584640	ah henry points it at himself and wants to end it all who does oris
2585440	2588400	do
2591520	2594640	no it's not the end we're not there yet oh if that happened
2595360	2601840	fuck you let me take chorus to the future uh let me go p real quick also there's no
2601840	2607680	weird tubes or lights or anything on it but i'm gonna go pee also same i'm not gonna good

2626160	2630880	thomas that thought that green light was lit baby he thought there were tubes on that gun
2630880	2638160	and he was ready to leave but it also would make any sense to uh for his character to shoot himself
2639120	2641440	henry henry would never do something like that
2643200	2651040	so
2651040	2655520	the guy who i prevented from drinking his own throw up one night because he
2655520	2660960	because he's because he threw up into his water glass after drinking games and he was about to
2660960	2668240	drink and i was like no i'd like grab his cup from him it's like you're gonna die you said that
2668240	2678800	at a funeral do what what are you eating there bud hot dog
2684320	2686640	i can't wait to try to cut that into something
2690320	2693760	damn a hot dog every episode just starts with hot dog
2694640	2700320	it's like our absolute get it cut to the drums of no backbone
2709200	2714800	do you guys want me to make you one yeah please boil some dogs over and leave them on your
2714800	2721040	doorstep for me wait boil you don't like boiled dogs no you gotta put it in the microwave
2721360	2726080	oh boilings no that is all you have to do microwave with water fucking put it in
2726080	2729920	put it in the bun you don't even need water just put it in the bun and microwave it for
2729920	2734240	30 seconds and it tastes exactly like a fucking boiled dog that's true i don't like my buns
2734240	2739520	microwaved you hey man if you want to feed yourself in exactly 30 seconds that's actually
2739520	2745440	a good i never do it cannot be beat do you like a good cold hot dog no you don't know
2745440	2749760	it's different it's different when i will eat a cold hot dog i used to like cold hot
2749760	2755280	dogs and then i had one recently and it was not the thing that i remember like my taste buds had
2755280	2762000	changed or something i was not into it leaves on your teeth yeah exactly uh positive i'd say no
2762000	2768320	hot dogs are bad the type of dogs they used to use when extinct so for you the cold ones don't
2768320	2775440	taste as good now that's true i like bread pug meat yeah if i'm eating a dick sandwich it's going
2775440	2780320	to be a brat for sure controversial opinion but hot dogs are way better i like both for different
2780320	2786000	reasons but i think i like hot dogs more my dad has been making his own brats lately and they're
2786000	2797280	fucking great my daddy's brats are better than yours oh no he's back he's arrived i love my dad's
2797280	2803920	sausage so what i what i like to do that god if you boil them and you slice them dogs in half
2803920	2808720	lengthwise i think like where and then you fry them in a pan hot dog style yeah that can be good
2808720	2812480	they get a good crust on the bottom and you can throw them on a sandwich instead of eating them
2812480	2818160	on a bun because they come out to like being more of a rectangular square so you got log sandwich
2818160	2822800	yeah it's flat on the bottom and then like round on the top if that makes sense oh no i love it
2822800	2828960	the shape you cut it completely in half or do you leave a little bit so it's all one piece no i don't
2828960	2833680	do that oh you mean like yeah so they splay open right but it's still connected yeah but it's still
2833680	2838800	open like so yeah if this is your hot dog like a hoagie and then you splay it open no like
2838800	2846800	justin's mom when you split my mom in half and fryer or like that fucking dude in bone tomahawk
2846800	2853200	holy shit have you guys seen that movie bone tomahawk bone tomahawk these guys should both
2853200	2861680	watch it it's fucking brutal i watched it to like get myself set up for running this old west story
2861680	2871040	which clearly like i learned a ton about the old west and the ceiling fans horse in horse garters
2871040	2879760	or whatever what about bone tomahawk yeah he's on he's on my uh celebrity pass list
2879760	2890160	the hidden character bone tony yeah it was a dlc code on halloween if you collect 12
2890160	2896240	tapes the 13th one is of thomas and bone tomahawk when thomas is on one of his passes
2898080	2902240	thomas is waggling his eyebrows who knows if any of this will be in the actual let's hope not
2902240	2907760	all right i pray to god every day yeah we're in the we're like in the middle of a oh yeah what
2907760	2917680	were we doing we were in combat and it is now technically at an end because silas cole is done
2917680	2928640	got and so judge and preacher sheriff doctor are both behind the shackled silas cole and ever at
2928640	2936160	pace is around back of this wagon looking at this rug and the feet that are inside of it with shoes
2936160	2943680	that he does not recognize but they're just weird and pearlman and green are walking around back
2944320	2951040	and the three of them are discussing what to do oh i think jack was helping me pull out the rug
2951040	2956880	when we left off and now that green uh has disarmed cole he's gonna go help them too ever
2956880	2965440	at pace jack pearlman and professor horace green you begin moving this rug out from the back of
2965440	2975840	this wagon the sun is high in the sky and the rug casts a shadow directly beneath it as sweat drips
2975840	2985280	from each of your brows and this humid summer thick air are you gonna thunk the other side
2985280	2990960	onto the ground or are you going to like slowly place it onto the ground i figured we'd set it
2990960	2996000	down and then give it a fun yank so it all unravels horse green says that to the group
2996000	3001360	i think we should lay it gently on the ground and then give the end a fun uh a fun yank so it
3001360	3006560	unravels quickly and whatever's inside comes whoop just zipping out but i mean it's it's
3006560	3010160	it's a person they they could they could be knocked out they could they could get hurt if
3010160	3015760	we're not careful here whoever is inside sorry yeah i think we should be careful i think we
3015760	3022480	should over ever come on we can we can do this alone there's a little bit of urgency in evert's
3022480	3027040	process here i mean he thinks there's a chance that there's a knocked out unconscious person
3027040	3032560	in here maybe not just a dead body so he's gonna he's gonna try and get her to the ground and
3032560	3037360	start maybe unrolling it maybe get around to the other side so he can make sure the head is there
3037360	3044720	and that not not bashed or anything and he wants to unravel the carpet and jack helps as ever at
3044720	3049680	pace and jack pearlman are doing this kind of slowly unrolling professor horse green kind of
3049680	3057280	reaches into the middle as it's unrolling and just i got outvoted oh okay i was just gonna
3057280	3066160	help out your cause i suppose so you guys unroll it slowly but surely and ever is moving his hands
3066160	3073440	kind of into the rug and you do you feel ahead of hair on the opposite side then i want to i want to
