0	5200	Hey, what's up? It's Zach. I just want to pop in here up top to make a quick announcement.
5200	10800	It's getting really cold outside. We here at PTBP feel super grateful to not only have a
10800	16080	warm place to sleep at night, but also the means to help those who don't. So we're going to take
16080	22000	the money from all new and upgrading Patreon supporters throughout the month of November.
22000	27520	We're going to double it and we're going to buy blankets and sleeping bags for folks in
27520	33440	Springfield who need them. So one more time for the people super focused on washing dishes or
33440	40080	eating pussy or both, if you join our Patreon or upgrade your support any time in the month
40080	47040	of November, we are going to take all that new and upgraded money, we're going to double it,
47040	53760	and then we're going to use that money to purchase blankets and sleeping bags for people in our area
53760	59200	who need some help staying warm this winter. This David Winters. Whatever, here's Wolf.
59200	68160	Hello my children from times past, present, and future. I've only just now in this moment
68160	75040	realized that I happen to be stuck in a fucking cage in this godforsaken barn.
75040	83520	And despite all my rage, I somehow wound up in the 1990s. What the flippin' fuck is going on
83600	91520	around here? My producer's going to get an earful about this whenever he is. But anyways,
91520	98640	since I'm stuck here, I may as well continue the show. As I always say, the show must go on.
98640	106960	I invented that saying. Everyone else who says it is plagiarizing me. Anyway, we got a new Howlin'
106960	114720	with Wolf, and this week's is presented by Stephen Lee from Brampton, Ontario, Canada,
114720	121760	who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pog. He writes, hello PTBP crew.
121760	130160	I wanted to thank you for hours of horrifying, heroin, and hilarious content. Last October,
130160	136800	I was seeking some good spooky content to binge and scratch that delta green itch,
136800	143040	and I began to listen. Listening motivated me enough to get a one-shot started with my
143040	150320	gaming group. Keep up the great work, and I'd like to shout out my own agents, Hannah, Sarah,
150320	156800	and Scott, as they probe the limits of scientific knowledge and the edges of what's real.
157520	164800	Well, damn. Hello, Stephen Lee. I'm happy that whatever this show is inspired you to do
164800	171520	something. You only have one shot in this life, unlike me, and I'm glad you are shooting that
171520	178240	one shot to run a one-shot with a gaming group. I'm glad you're doing whatever the hell it is
178240	185440	you're doing, and I hope you're loving doing it. Ta-ta for now. Well, now, if you want to
185440	191360	write up something for your dimension hopping wolf to hell, it's really quite simple. Just
191360	198960	tag at Pretending Pod on Twitter or Instagram, or you can go above and beyond. Spend 30 seconds
198960	206160	of your time. Write a quick five-star review on Apple Podcasts, and then let us know it was you
206160	215920	with an email to pretendingpod at gmail.com. Pretending Pod. Pretending Pod. Pretending Pod.
215920	220240	If you can't support the show by telling your friends that you're a heckin' weirdo,
220240	228960	throw us some bones on Patreon in exchange for a slop trough full of 24 episodes. Like that piece
228960	236160	of shit Zack said at the top of the show, we're out here slingin' extra tent to purchase tents
236160	242720	and sleeping bags for folks who need them. It's cold out there, but Wolf's got a warm heart.
243280	251200	Now, everyone listening to this, please do me an actually important favor. Stop whatever you are
251200	259680	doing right now. Raise your snout to the sky like the animal you are, and shout these three words
259680	268320	at the top of your lungs. Fuck Mark Zuckerberg. It's time for the news. Last time, Federal
268320	279280	Marshal Harlan Nash, ATF Agent Tanner Tan, Luda Hyde, and DEA Agents Joe Dean and Cindy Woodabaga
279280	286480	were sent to Groversville, Tennessee, the bud end of regional jokes due to the reported UFO sightings
286480	294640	in the area. What brought them there, however, was neither unidentified nor flying. A recent high
294640	301200	school graduate named Billy Ray Spivey smashed a hole in his dad's chest before going on a
301200	308160	painkiller-focused burglary spree, which included punching a gas station attendant in the head so
308160	315200	hard that the victim's gore detached and flew off his shoulders. After being hit center mass with
315200	321280	four rounds, Billy went down long enough for the cops on the scene to detain and sedate the
321280	329920	unnaturally strong teen boy. With that information, Ncel badgered the apprehended and restrained Billy
329920	336480	Ray, considered cutting him open, and eventually went to his girlfriend's house in Groversville.
336480	342640	She wasn't there, but they talked to her weird mom for a weirder amount of time. Thankfully,
342640	349280	they found a business card in her room for Scott Adams, a UFO hunter with a group called Watch the
349280	358320	Skies. Watch the Skies? More like watch these guys keep interviewing this cool ass mom for the next
358320	376160	four episodes. Shit might get hairy, but at least we have Brat Pit with Miss Mary.
388320	417440	You guys know the we are farmers thing, but this time it's like
417440	427120	David Winters. David Winters is here, everyone, to run us through a game of Delta Green. Yes,
427120	434000	he decided that one episode was not enough. You didn't get the closure you were seeking, David?
434000	439120	No, I was shooting for a single episode appearance, but it seems as though I bit
439120	443040	off more than I could chew, and I am now contractually obligated to stay.
443040	448560	We are a mouthful. We did find you to a really, really brutal contract.
448560	449920	How much are we making him pay us?
453040	455200	Really should read those things before I sign them.
455200	458880	We actually have a controlling stake in the glass cannon network now.
458880	460400	He's going to have to break to those guys.
464320	469600	Well, I didn't have one in the first place. Well, it's kind of like every time you update
469600	474400	your phone's operating system, and you're just like, agree, agree, agree. How bad could this be?
474400	477840	That's what we actually slipped it into, was your latest Samsung terms of service.
479680	484160	We looked at you, and we were like, he's not an Apple guy. He's not using an iPhone.
484160	485120	He's like me.
485120	486480	He's one of the Thomases of the world.
486480	489840	Actually, I bet you are an Apple guy. Am I correct? Yes.
489840	495040	I was wrong. I walked in the store the other day. I was like, give me another one, please.
495760	502000	Not the newest one, but one that's better than mine currently that will actually open up
502000	506480	when I click an app because there for a while, David, I was clicking an app,
506480	511920	and then it would just close because my phone didn't work anymore because it was 10 years old.
511920	513840	Wow. That's impressive.
513840	514880	10 years old?
514880	515200	Yeah.
515200	516160	2011?
516160	520320	Yeah, as an iPhone original series. I had the OG iPhone.
520320	522160	Wow. That was from 2007.
522160	523440	Yep. A decade ago.
524960	525920	Never forget.
525920	527600	We already did 30 seconds of silence.
528400	531920	Yeah, but then Luke brought up 9-11, so we've got to do 30 more.
531920	532420	30 more.
533600	534880	Josh, respect.
534880	535380	Jesus.
539280	540800	I don't want to do another 30 seconds.
543760	545360	It's so uncomfortable the first time.
546560	547920	You know what was uncomfortable?
547920	550240	As as a nation, watching those people leap to their deaths.
552240	554560	Can we take 30 fucking seconds, Joe?
556400	557520	A moment of silence.
560800	562160	I don't like that at all.
564000	564480	No, sir.
567920	574560	And with that, I think let's get into this episode of this one shot that we're doing
574560	576400	here with David Winters.
576400	579280	Have you ever heard this? Winters is coming.
579280	581600	That's what he says every time he climaxes.
584320	585440	Episode two.
585440	586720	We feel like we know you.
586720	588480	We're comfortable with you, David.
588480	589600	Are you comfortable?
590720	592000	I'm so comfortable.
592000	592880	You don't even know.
594640	596080	That is actually scary.
596080	600240	All right, let's go into this 18-year-old girl's room.
601200	601700	Mm-hmm.
606400	608640	We just found a business card.
608640	610000	Yeah, and we're gonna...
610000	610800	Yes, yes, yes.
610800	615760	We need to go talk to Bradley Allen, he uses his computer.
615760	616880	We've got a lot of people we need to talk to.
616880	621040	Bradley Allen has potentially been at work missing this whole time,
621040	625040	but we do know there's an internet-capable computer at his work, so...
626320	629440	Was the town hall and the sheriff's office all kind of together?
629440	631920	Yep, yep, that's all the center of Grover'sville.
631920	633440	We're gonna kill a lot of birds.
634480	636640	He found a business card, just to recap.
636640	639840	Scott Adams, watch the skies with an email address.
639840	642000	Watch the skies at AOL.
642000	642500	Watch.
643200	643700	Yes.
644080	647280	He's probably still working through his 20 free hours
647280	651360	from his last three and a half inch floppy disk that he just received.
652400	654560	Those were fun in the early 90s.
654560	657760	All the CDs and floppy disks is where they try to get you hooked.
657760	658560	AOL mailers.
658560	662000	You're like, hey, you can get 20 hours of internet a month for $15.
664000	666480	Now, did you look more closely at the business card?
666480	668400	We didn't even get to the business card that much.
668400	669600	Did we put it under blacklight?
672160	673840	Yeah, if you have a black...
673840	678080	Someone has to have a Room Raider style blacklight flashlight
678080	679520	on their character sheet, right?
679520	682000	I think Harlan definitely would.
682800	684000	He was wearing cargo pants.
684000	687040	I think all those pockets were full of things like that.
687840	688340	That was...
689040	692000	We didn't have time to send you the list of things in Harlan's pants,
692000	694160	but I reviewed it beforehand.
694160	695280	That was one of the things.
695920	700640	If you want to check the business card for semen, you can do so.
701760	704240	Yeah, that's standard procedure in my line of work.
704240	706080	This is a pretty sexy business card.
706080	710640	We do need to think like 1992, so we should probably also check for prints.
710640	712960	So we do that because we're cops in 1992.
712960	713600	Rest in peace.
715840	716400	The show?
717520	718020	The show.
721200	722400	Yeah, that was sad.
724480	725680	30 seconds of silence.
727280	728240	What's up, everybody?
729120	730880	Further look at the business card.
730880	733200	Yeah, we are investigating the business card, right?
733200	736640	Yeah, so do you want to use forensics if any of you...
736640	738720	Yeah, I got 50 of that.
738720	739280	Hey, me too.
740080	741120	I ain't got none.
741120	741620	Go for it.
743520	744720	49!
744720	746160	I failed a 61.
747040	749600	Alright, with your forensic skill, you dust for prints,
749600	752400	but that's a weird thing to dust for on a business card.
752400	756080	However, also with your forensic skill, you flip the business card over
756080	758400	and there's also a phone number handwritten on the back.
762000	763680	Good thing you rolled a success.
763680	765040	Otherwise, you wouldn't have seen that.
766240	766960	I'm looking at it.
767920	769280	What are these numbers?
771440	776160	Alright, I swear to God, these make the same amount of digits.
777360	778800	How many is a phone number?
780000	781280	We'll have to call it.
781280	782720	I bet it's Scott Adams.
782720	784000	We'll have to get to a phone.
784000	787440	I bet there's one near the computer at Bradley's office.
787440	790320	Hey, do you think this is famed creator of Dilbert, Scott Adams?
793440	796320	That's the assumption I was operating under.
796320	796960	I bet it is.
798400	801760	Cindy Woodapega looks really serious and goes,
802480	804560	I don't read the newspaper.
804560	805840	And not even the funnies?
805840	807840	Dilbert's a slice of office life comic.
808480	811040	I've got a few of them posted up in my cubicle back at,
811840	815680	you know, our main DAA headquarters in the city that that is located in.
815680	819040	Whatever field office we're currently based out of, which is uh...
819040	819540	Memphis?
820160	821680	Yeah, Memphis.
821680	823360	Back in my cubicle in Memphis.
823360	824800	I'll show you when we get back there.
824800	826000	I look forward to it.
826000	826720	It's pretty funny.
826720	827840	Dogworth flies a plane.
827840	837920	Well, Nancy, I think I know what the answer is going to be,
837920	841600	but are you familiar with the Scott Adams fella?
841600	844400	Yes, but I haven't seen a newspaper and...
845120	845840	Oh, sorry.
845840	846880	Not the Dilbert guy.
846880	847600	No, this.
847600	849440	And I show her the business card.
850400	851120	No, I don't.
851120	852320	I don't know who that is.
852320	857760	Was your daughter into like Dilbert or UFOs or anything like that?
857840	863280	Either of those things.
864160	865680	Yeah, and stuff like it.
867680	869600	A weird Venn diagram of the two.
871600	875520	Yeah, she collected all of the alien themed Dilbert cartoons.
875520	876080	How'd you know?
876880	878880	That just a lucky guess.
878880	882320	That Venn diagram's a circle from November of 87.
882320	884240	I ran for a few weeks.
885280	886560	Dogworth flies a UFO.
888000	896640	No, I have no idea who Scott Adams is, nor do I care.
896640	900880	Nancy, this is kind of a stretch, but did your daughter ever mention,
901920	906400	you know, exploring the theoretical limits of human capability,
906960	909200	perhaps through surgical enhancements?
910720	914800	No, I thought you were going to say through seeking higher education in college,
914880	919200	and she has discussed that, but surgical enhancements less so.
920640	922080	Where did she want to go?
922080	931520	She wanted to go to the Ohio State University because the V sounds so strong.
933520	934480	Prestigious.
934480	935040	I agree.
935040	937600	That is, that's assertive.
937600	939840	Did she already have a major picked out?
939840	941120	I don't think so.
941120	941920	I don't know.
941920	942640	Illustration?
942640	947600	Yeah, cartoon literary critique.
947600	949280	It's all coming together.
949280	950480	Nancy, this is very important.
950480	952960	Did she ever correspond with any famous cartoonists?
955440	960880	She did with Scott Adams, Gary Larson, Gary Larson.
960880	961760	The far side?
961760	963600	Yes, she's a big far side fan.
963600	964400	The rapper?
964400	964960	Who isn't?
964960	968160	Oh no, I mean, I've got just as many far sides as I do Dilberts.
968800	970400	I can't wait to get you back to Memphis.
973280	978400	I can't wait to get you back to Memphis is an awesome name for a country album.
978400	978880	Yep.
978880	979520	Holy shit.
980880	986480	Well, do you guys, can you think of anything else or should we try to get on the internet?
986480	989840	I wish you the best of luck trying to find this internet you're looking for.
990720	996800	Yeah, I would say you're pretty suspicious to me, but I can't really put my finger on it.
996800	999520	That doesn't mean you're considered a suspect at this time.
999520	1000800	Person of interest.
1000800	1001680	Perhaps.
1001680	1002160	Okay.
1002160	1006000	We like letting people know being very transparent.
1006000	1007600	But a human role on her.
1007600	1009600	Tell me if she's under the influence of anything.
1009600	1010640	Can I do that?
1010640	1011440	That's good.
1011440	1013680	You can roll medicine or human.
1013680	1015200	Uh, I'm going to human.
1016640	1018080	Cause no one has medicine.
1019680	1021840	I critical fail 88.
1021840	1024480	Oh, you just yell.
1024480	1025520	She's on drugs.
1026160	1033680	She looks as though with your critical fail that she might be very high on PCP right now.
1035920	1039280	Does his critical fail preclude me from trying to human role?
1040160	1040960	You can go for it.
1041520	1048960	The side effects of PCP at higher doses include hallucinations, catatonic posturing,
1048960	1052640	increased blood pressure, rapid heart rate, raised temperature, and shallow breathing
1052640	1056080	of which is demonstrating all of them with your critical failure.
1056080	1057360	How do you know David Winters?
1060400	1061840	This is part of my prep.
1061840	1064720	I have to, I have to have a random.
1064720	1065360	Sorry, honey.
1065360	1067040	I have to live and breathe these characters.
1068240	1069680	Micro doses, PCP.
1073120	1074560	I'm like whispering to one of them.
1075920	1080400	She's, she's sweating and she's got the elevated heart rate and her shallow breathing.
1080400	1081120	You'd see it, right?
1081120	1082800	You see all those signs, right?
1083360	1089920	Yeah, we're, it is classic signs of PCP, but, uh, there does seem to just be something
1089920	1091120	strange in her eyes.
1091120	1092720	Uh, something that's not there.
1092720	1094080	Why don't I take a crack at this?
1094640	1097600	I rolled a, uh, a 38 on a 60.
1097600	1099840	She does not look to be under the influence of PCP.
1100400	1101200	Contrary.
1101200	1102400	This is classic PCP.
1103600	1104080	It's not.
1106000	1108000	I agree with Harlan.
1108000	1118320	Wait, you look, bear in mind, you do have, you do have two DEA agents and you have tattoos
1118320	1120400	of PCP on your arm.
1120400	1126480	I have so many PCP tattoos that show what PCP looks like.
1126480	1127920	Do you have any ICP tattoos?
1127920	1133520	Well, you have the cartoon of Dogbert doing PCP and demonstrating all the effects.
1133520	1134800	Yes, of course.
1134800	1137360	Well, my juggalo name is tattooed on the back of my neck.
1137760	1138320	Crystal.
1138320	1138820	Crystal.
1139520	1144880	So I wanted to roll a natural and I rolled a 91 because I was trying to see if there's
1144880	1149040	anything in her eyes that looked unnatural as I'm trying to make my determinations,
1149040	1150240	but I failed miserably.
1150240	1151200	Do you have any unnatural?
1151200	1152240	I have 10 unnatural.
1152240	1159760	I took it to explain my backstory, uh, which, oh, I'll get to it.
1162400	1163280	If you don't die first.
1164320	1164820	Fair enough.
1165780	1168740	We've seen her far in the future shitting on a toilet with her smartphone.
1170340	1171700	It was a 90 year old woman.
1171700	1176020	I've got no problem killing this person in the universe forking in two directions.
1177540	1178740	So you're on notice sec.
1180020	1181060	He's not invincible.
1182260	1183060	Damn it.
1183060	1183540	Okay.
1183540	1185060	I don't think she's on.
1185060	1187860	I can't tell that she, do you think she's on drugs?
1187860	1189460	No, I don't think she's on drugs.
1190340	1190980	Yeah.
1190980	1193620	I think she's just really fucking weird.
1193620	1193860	Yeah.
1193860	1195780	I don't really like being around her.
1195780	1197380	It makes me very uncomfortable.
1197380	1200660	I did kind of want to have this whole conversation like away from her.
1200660	1203540	We're all just staring her in the eyes while we're talking,
1203540	1205380	but honestly she's probably fine with it.
1205380	1205540	Yeah.
1205540	1210500	She's just watching you just like something's clearly wrong, but I don't think it's drugs,
1210500	1210820	ma'am.
1210820	1218500	Um, have you come under any four episodes of us just questioning this?
1220500	1223140	You guys are, you're down with Intel, right?
1224020	1226820	Absolutely.
1227540	1228020	Okay.
1228020	1231220	Um, ma'am, have you come under the influence of anything?
1232260	1234820	He kind of loves his voice and gets like a little closer.
1236260	1236740	Spooky.
1239140	1241140	Don't do me now.
1241700	1242260	Spooky.
1243540	1244820	Is the X-Files out yet?
1244820	1249380	Like dragons, aliens, Allens.
1251220	1252180	Oh, you know what?
1252180	1253140	I've been in about a year.
1253140	1257140	There's a show like an exactly this, this time next year.
1258580	1260660	You're going to be like, wowie zowie.
1260660	1260900	Wow.
1260900	1263780	I can really relate to what those guys were going through.
1263780	1265300	They should have called it the end files.
1268180	1271700	Anyway, I saw that in my partner's eyes one time.
1271700	1272340	That's how I know.
1275620	1277540	We sound crazier than she does.
1277540	1278980	So we need to get the fuck out.
1278980	1279940	Let's go talk to Bradley.
1279940	1280420	Time to leave.
1281140	1281620	Look at that.
1281700	1282500	Take care.
1282500	1282820	Cool.
1282820	1282980	Yeah.
1282980	1287220	Can we do like a little quick search of the rest of the house as we go out?
1287220	1287720	Sure.
1289300	1290340	Like just to search.
1290340	1292100	I rolled a 16 on a 70.
1294180	1294980	Pass.
1294980	1296180	48 on a 50.
1296180	1296900	I failed.
1296900	1297540	I failed too.
1297540	1298740	A 79 on a 70.
1298740	1300020	I rolled a 79.
1300660	1304260	They tumbled down the stairs, but we noticed behind a picture frame.
1305700	1306200	Yeah.
1308100	1308600	Oh shit.
1312260	1315380	Boy, well, no critical successes.
1316100	1316980	That's what I was.
1316980	1318100	I was looking for there.
1318100	1320580	Otherwise you would have found, uh, several bodies.
1322740	1324260	I just didn't look that direction.
1324900	1327620	You would have found a little alien mind controlling her behind the walls.
1329460	1331620	There's nothing out of place or out of the ordinary.
1331620	1332740	The house is pristine.
1333300	1335700	You see clearly her husband lives there as well.
1335700	1338340	Much like the daughter, their rooms are spotless.
1338340	1343540	It seems as though this lady just walks around the house, cleans all day and thinks about
1343540	1344820	Dilbert cartoons.
1344820	1345940	And that's pretty much it.
1345940	1348820	In a lot of ways, Joe Dane can relate to that.
1350340	1350580	Wow.
1350580	1352100	That's really sad, man.
1352100	1353140	He's a by the book guy.
1354980	1357060	Let's head down to this city center.
1357060	1357620	City hall.
1357620	1359140	We're doing a city hall.
1359140	1360180	Do we want to do?
1360180	1361380	It's about 10 o'clock now.
1361380	1362740	We spent two hours there.
1363700	1367140	You spent two hours, both in story and in real life.
1367140	1367700	Questioning.
1371780	1372820	I want to be very clear.
1372820	1377700	You can never spend less in game time than you spend in real life doing something.
1380340	1384980	According to her, her husband's still there, so we might as well stop by.
1384980	1386020	According to her.
1386660	1388660	And she seems super trustworthy.
1390180	1395060	Let's go see the sheriff first and we can talk about, we can ascertain what the local
1395060	1400260	fuzz knows and maybe get kind of a more bird's eye view of the town from him.
1400260	1400900	I agree with that.
1400900	1404180	We don't need to let him know that we need to use the internet to look this shit up.
1404180	1405140	To the sheriff.
1405140	1407860	You drive about the one mile back into town.
1407860	1409620	Again, center of town is the town hall.
1409620	1416260	Just to the side is the joint sheriff's office, ambulance, single ambulance stand and volunteer
1416260	1417300	fire department.
1417300	1423140	You knock on the door and conveniently the sheriff, even though it's 10 o'clock at night,
1423140	1424660	is still working.
1424660	1426020	And he greets you.
1426740	1428580	Ah, you agents.
1428580	1430100	Thank you for finally making it.
1430980	1431940	Sheriff Dan Oakley.
1432900	1433940	How goes it?
1433940	1435860	Oakley, it's nice to make your acquaintance.
1435860	1437300	And she puts out a hand.
1437300	1439140	Is she taller than him too?
1439140	1440260	No, he's pretty tall.
1440260	1446020	He's tall, but fat with gray hair, solid gray mustache hugging his upper lip.
1446020	1449460	He looks kind of like a poor man's cliff from Cheers.
1449460	1456740	As he goes to meet her for a, for a hand shake, she like dodges it and then goes for
1456740	1461860	a hug where she puts her arms around his, like right above his belt.
1463060	1464100	Whoa, whoa there, miss.
1464100	1465620	Hey, careful.
1466980	1467780	Good to meet you.
1467780	1469220	Close to my gun, if you know what I mean.
1470340	1471540	Close to your woodpecker.
1471540	1472820	I'm Cindy Woodpecker.
1474820	1475540	Nice to meet you.
1476180	1477220	Sheriff Dan Oakley.
1477220	1479140	I've got to apologize for my partner.
1479140	1482100	I'm agent Dodine and this is my partner.
1482740	1484740	Agent Cindy Woodpecker, DEA.
1485300	1487940	These are our associates on this current task force.
1487940	1488820	Harlin.
1488820	1489620	Hello.
1489620	1490660	Tan Luthad.
1490660	1491300	Hello Tan.
1491860	1492660	Nice to meet you all.
1493220	1495620	Sounds like you've got a real pickle here in town.
1495620	1495780	Yeah.
1495780	1498500	Why don't you brief us on what you know so far, Sheriff?
1498500	1503060	And she lets go of the embrace or just life in general.
1504340	1505220	I don't want to be around.
1505220	1506180	Which would you prefer?
1507540	1508100	Let it go.
1508900	1512420	No, as she lets go of the Sheriff, you see that, like,
1512420	1515700	Jodine has had a very intense grasp on like her belt,
1515700	1518180	like trying to like pull her away this whole time.
1519380	1522420	Like a dog straight on the leash, pulling her back.
1522420	1523060	Yes.
1523060	1525700	Okay, so you successfully pull her back and he's,
1527220	1529060	I'm glad you made it in here.
1529780	1531220	Welcome to my town.
1531220	1535460	Been Sheriff here for years and it's not too often we get
1535700	1538340	city folk in here.
1538340	1539380	What do you want to know?
1539380	1540580	What can I help you with?
1540580	1542820	Can you tell me how to get to Sesame Street?
1543540	1544660	Sunny days.
1544660	1545380	Ah, nice.
1545380	1546020	Okay, sick.
1546020	1547700	So you're a Grover's fan too.
1547700	1550180	All right, so we just got in.
1550180	1554340	We went to the Allen's house and that mother is under some
1554340	1555220	sort of influence.
1555220	1558820	Doesn't seem to be drugs from my personal understanding of
1558820	1561060	the situation, but she is out of it for real.
1561060	1564180	And she has not seen her daughter who was the boyfriend in
1564180	1564660	forever.
1565220	1566900	The daughter was the boyfriend?
1566900	1567860	Yeah, three weeks.
1568420	1568660	Yeah.
1568660	1573220	So has there been a, would you say, a rash of disappearances
1573220	1573780	in this town?
1574420	1575300	Not that I'm aware of.
1576420	1577620	Is that what you're investigating?
1577620	1580900	No, no, we're here investigating a super myth.
1580900	1583940	Yeah, a rare strain of super myth with the DEA.
1583940	1587380	But Sheriff, let me ask you one question real quick that
1587380	1588900	might cut to the quick here.
1590340	1593140	Has anything been going wrong in your town lately or do you
1593220	1594500	feel like things are just fine?
1594500	1599620	Are you insulting my ability to police this town?
1599620	1600100	No, sir.
1600100	1602180	That's a standard DEA question.
1602740	1604180	It's just something we have to ask.
1604180	1605140	It's part of a forum.
1605140	1608260	When drugs are involved, oftentimes things go a little haywire.
1608260	1611140	We just wanted to see if there's no drugs.
1611140	1612500	There are no drugs here.
1612500	1613780	Let's just put it that way.
1613780	1617380	I feel like I've kind of given a sort of presence to where
1617380	1619700	he's going to ignore me, which is what I was going for.
1619700	1624420	I'd like to be looking for cuts, small incisions on his skin
1625220	1628020	while he is caught off guard by being offended.
1628020	1628740	Give me a search.
1629620	1630340	22.
1633140	1634020	Hell yes.
1634020	1637220	You get a good enough look because remember it required
1637220	1639780	that last time to see those tiny little pricks.
1640980	1642420	He does not have them.
1644660	1647140	He would have had to have found a way to manage the pain.
1647540	1653300	Sheriff, were you aware that Jane Allen has been missing?
1653860	1655860	No, I wasn't.
1655860	1659140	Have any other kids gone missing that you're aware of?
1659140	1661140	Well, that Billy Ray boy, of course.
1661140	1662500	But you know all about that.
1663060	1665860	Yeah, that's kind of what sent us down here.
1665860	1667620	The super meth that he was on.
1667620	1668340	Yeah.
1668340	1671620	Which is how come he was able to punch his daddy through the chest so hard.
1671620	1674340	Yeah, it's real shame.
1674340	1675620	Yeah, real shame.
1675620	1676340	And the devil.
1677060	1678420	You know, them kids.
1678420	1681060	The combination of the two is really horrible.
1681060	1681780	DND.
1681780	1683700	It gets them all riled up.
1683700	1684500	Always at work.
1685540	1687860	Yeah, kids need church.
1687860	1689140	Spiritual war is real.
1689940	1690340	It is.
1690340	1694580	It seems you have two churches here, which seems a little light for a town of 1200.
1695700	1698100	Do you have problems with attendance?
1698100	1700340	What percentage of your population would you say attends?
1700340	1701140	It's a light flock.
1701140	1702420	Let's put it that way.
1702420	1704740	We used to have three churches.
1704740	1705300	Shame.
1705300	1706260	One went out of business.
1707780	1709060	Yeah, it's happening all over.
1709060	1710740	To the extent churches are businesses.
1710740	1713380	Of course, everything should be run like a business.
1713380	1714500	And it's America.
1714500	1714820	Yeah.
1714820	1716340	Are you looking to attend services?
1716340	1718500	Is that why you're asking these very specific church questions?
1718500	1720020	Maybe if we're in town long enough.
1720020	1724100	The next question I actually want to know is, have you seen Bradley Allen recently?
1724980	1725460	The Alder?
1725460	1727540	Yeah, he's next door.
1727540	1728980	Yeah, he works next door.
1728980	1733220	Have you seen him coming and going from work in the past few days or even weeks?
1733860	1735060	Yeah, here and there.
1735060	1737140	When was the last couple days ago?
1737140	1737860	What's he like?
1737860	1739460	What can you tell us about him?
1739460	1740100	Smart man.
1740820	1744500	He was educated in the big city.
1744500	1746740	We're lucky to have him as a leader.
1746740	1748180	Is he from around here?
1748180	1748980	Born and bred.
1757220	1758420	Let's go to the bakery.
1758420	1759700	We're getting to the butt end of this.
1761780	1764980	If I could be of any service to you all, I'd be happy to.
1765060	1767860	But I think this drug stuff is nonsense.
1767860	1769700	It would never happen under my watch.
1769700	1773700	Sheriff, you never know with folks not attending church like they once did.
1773700	1778340	I've seen good, upstanding Christian children just go astray.
1778340	1782740	And so you told me your flock was diminishing and we're with the DEA.
1782740	1785140	It gets, you wouldn't believe what we see.
1785780	1786980	Super meth for one.
1786980	1788740	But we're basically healers.
1788740	1789940	You have nothing to worry about.
1789940	1792500	We're going to come in and we're going to take care of it.
1792580	1795780	And you're going to look like a hero and it'll be great.
1795780	1797060	I want to know one thing.
1797060	1801460	And that is you're here investigating the super meth.
1801460	1803460	Why are you looking for missing people?
1803460	1806740	The, the boy, uh, Billy Ray Spivvy.
1806740	1807540	Spivvy?
1807540	1808980	How do folks say that around here?
1808980	1809780	Spivvy.
1809780	1810820	Spivvy.
1810820	1812420	Those spivvy spivvies.
1813940	1815140	And the spivvy spivvies.
1815140	1817620	You said that with perhaps a hint of disdain.
1817620	1820740	Is that a family that's, that causes some, some ruckus?
1820740	1821380	Occasionally.
1822100	1823060	Occasionally.
1823060	1826820	They've been known to get in trouble with the law.
1826820	1830420	Well, then I doubt you'd be surprised to hear that we suspect that's baby boy brought the
1830420	1834500	super meth to your town and he might've spread it around to some of his friends.
1834500	1839780	And with the drugs, a lot of the times, you know, people don't pay their, what they owe
1839780	1840980	and people go missing.
1840980	1845540	And so that's kind of the connection of, you know, every thread we can kind of pull on.
1845540	1848260	So we were just looking for his girlfriend then that Jane Allen.
1848900	1854740	And we dropped by her mama's house who said that she ain't seen her in about three weeks.
1854740	1857460	So that got us, that was just got us wondering.
1857460	1859220	I'm, I'm sure she's going to be fine.
1859220	1864980	I wouldn't, I'll fill out a report, but kids around here, very mature.
1864980	1870500	Speaking of the kids around here, I was curious if you, if you knew about the local hangouts,
1870500	1874580	where, where do they, where do those kids congregate, especially the seniors in town?
1874580	1879700	Well, the kids that can drink, they, they go to Murrells County bunker.
1879700	1883220	It's the only place in town with, with booze license.
1883220	1884500	We keep all the riffraff there.
1885220	1887780	The younger ones, I know what those kids do.
1888340	1891780	They have their siblings buy them beer at the county bunker.
1891780	1895060	And then they take it down to the reservoir and hang at the reservoir.
1895780	1899700	And how, how, how big a gathering do you sometimes find there at the reservoir?
1899700	1903700	Is it, is it five or six kids or is it 20 or 30 kids?
1903700	1904740	Ah, just a handful.
1904740	1906260	Small town, small town.
1906260	1907380	What day is today?
1907380	1908740	Yeah, is it party time?
1908740	1910820	It's a, it is a Thursday night.
1910820	1911780	Thirsty Thursday.
1911780	1912420	Thirsty Thursday.
1917380	1919220	I bet the kids are down at the reservoir.
1919220	1923060	Maybe we go down there and talk to them after we talk to Mr. Allen.
1923620	1924660	If he's, yeah.
1924660	1925700	If he's in there.
1925700	1928500	How many aldermen does this town have besides Mr. Allen?
1928500	1928820	Eight.
1929460	1930340	Name all of them.
1930980	1935540	Oh, super good.
1935540	1936580	I'd really rather not.
1938180	1940740	I'll tell you the head aldermen is Merle barn.
1940740	1941540	Oh, that makes sense.
1942260	1942500	Yeah.
1942500	1943940	Richest man in town.
1943940	1946260	Is he the booze owner and the hotel we're staying at?
1946260	1946820	Yes, sir.
1946820	1947540	Oh yeah.
1947540	1949860	And the hotel and the auto body shop.
1949860	1952100	Who owns the ice cream parlor?
1952100	1953620	Oh, that's not Merle.
1953620	1955220	It's competing business of his.
1956100	1956980	The mega deuce.
1957700	1964100	I would recommend if, uh, you, you recognize it is almost midnight and you have not had
1964100	1966420	anything to eat nor are you sleeping.
1966420	1969700	Where can we get a bite to eat at midnight around here?
1969700	1976980	Only if the mega deuce in a town like this, uh, everything shuts down at about nine o'clock
1976980	1979780	except the 24 seven mega deuce.
1979780	1980820	That's very handy.
1980820	1986420	That doesn't seem like a great business idea, but I'm glad they're open.
1987220	1988500	Should we go talk to Bradley?
1991060	1996260	Well, I mean, so sheriff is the city hall open right now.
1996260	1997380	Would anybody be there?
1997940	1998440	Probably.
1999060	1999540	Yeah.
1999540	1999780	Yeah.
1999780	2000740	Let's go check it out.
2000740	2001540	Yeah, let's go.
2001540	2006900	She opens up her purse and pulls out a few cliff bars and hands them out to the group.
2006900	2010180	Chomp these, uh, grainy boys down on the way there.
2010900	2011540	Give me some.
2011540	2012980	No, you don't want one?
2013540	2014420	And they don't exist.
2014420	2015300	Cliff bars exist.
2015940	2018900	Oh, she pulls out four bags of trail mix.
2020340	2022100	Oh, her home at her trail mix is good.
2022100	2023460	There's lots of M and M's.
2023460	2027940	What's the brand of those really, really dry nature valley nature valley.
2027940	2028500	Yeah.
2028500	2029940	I think those are boosted at the time.
2029940	2032180	Those were definitely around by the mid nineties.
2032180	2034580	Man, those things make a mess, huh?
2034580	2035780	Yeah, they're good though.
2035780	2037780	They are really tasty before we leave.
2038340	2040180	Harlan wants to ask the Sheriff.
2040180	2044980	Uh, Sheriff, are you, uh, are you aware of, uh, of a Scott Adams in town?
2046340	2048740	Scott at yes.
2049620	2050580	That troublemaker.
2050580	2050900	Yes.
2050900	2054260	I looking at a UFO nonsense.
2054260	2055460	One of those idiots.
2055460	2057860	What does he have to do with the drugs?
2057860	2058420	Oh, nothing.
2058420	2060820	We were just wondering if he was the fellow who wrote Dilbert.
2060820	2061300	Same name.
2062340	2063140	I checked.
2063140	2064660	Would you run a background check on him?
2065300	2065780	Not him.
2066740	2068020	That is disappointing.
2068020	2072020	On average, how many UFO abductions do you have around here?
2072020	2072820	We're just fans.
2074420	2076980	Wait, we don't have any.
2076980	2078100	That is nonsense.
2078740	2079780	Bunch of poppycock.
2079780	2082820	If you ask me, I just it's, it's ATF procedure.
2082820	2086580	You got to ask, have you been your, your whole life Sheriff?
2086580	2087220	Born and bred.
2088180	2089060	He said it again.
2089700	2095540	What, what to the best of your knowledge is the, the origin of these UFO conspiracies
2095540	2096900	surrounding this town.
2096900	2099780	Why are you asking so many questions about UFOs?
2100900	2103220	Wait, is that David or the Sheriff?
2103220	2105060	Uh, why are you asking?
2109940	2111620	I was like, you're gaslighting us.
2111620	2117620	If the spooky Delta green story about a UFO town doesn't like anyway.
2117620	2117860	Okay.
2118740	2124660	Well, no, it's just that, uh, well, we heard that was kind of, uh, you know, what passes
2124660	2127540	for tourist draw around here was kind of the UFO.
2127540	2127700	Yeah.
2127700	2131460	We like to get to know the history, even the alternative false histories.
2131460	2132900	We need to know the character of the town.
2132900	2133540	Sure.
2133540	2134260	Sure.
2134260	2134760	Yes.
2135620	2136100	Fine.
2136100	2139380	Uh, yes, we are the butt end of jokes all across the country.
2140100	2144420	They say those idiots in Grover's Ville, they say they're such Muppets.
2144420	2145620	They named a Muppet after him.
2145620	2146820	That's what they say about us.
2147620	2149140	I'm from Ralphsburg.
2149140	2150340	So I understand.
2150340	2150980	Oh, sorry.
2150980	2151620	Rolfsburg.
2151620	2154500	Yeah.
2154500	2155620	I'm sorry to hear that.
2155620	2156900	I'm from Elmo town.
2156900	2161620	So I also completely I'm from big birding 10 say one, Joe.
2161620	2164820	Uh, snuffle up against, uh, that's, uh, that's one of them.
2164820	2165460	Snuffle up.
2168980	2170740	What we're saying is we know your pain.
2170740	2171140	Yeah.
2171140	2172340	We don't think this is a mother.
2172340	2173140	Thank you.
2173140	2175860	Sounds like you got your head on straight about all this, but why?
2175860	2176660	What again?
2176660	2177460	Yes, sir.
2177460	2178340	What's the origin?
2178340	2179060	Why did it start?
2179140	2183540	Was there like a Roswell crash siding sort of precipitating incident or
2184260	2189300	people say they see stuff in the skies and that kind of nonsense.
2189940	2191300	Never seen it myself.
2191300	2192420	Think it's a bunch of hooey.
2192980	2193940	This town's fine.
2194660	2197940	I am a great sheriff to be clear.
2197940	2198900	I believe that.
2198900	2199540	I believe that.
2199540	2200020	Sheriff.
2200020	2200500	Yeah.
2200500	2200900	You know what?
2200900	2203620	Here's our car phone number and he scribbles it down.
2203620	2204500	You just call us.
2205140	2205640	Yeah.
2206260	2206760	Yeah.
2207320	2207820	Wow.
2209160	2213400	So you just call us anytime you got some pertinent information.
2213400	2215400	You might think of anything you think of.
2215400	2216680	You can call the DAA.
2216680	2217000	Sorry.
2217000	2219080	I just, I want to be clear here.
2219080	2221160	It's a phone in your car.
2221160	2221660	Yeah.
2222360	2222520	Yeah.
2222520	2224120	I think they've had those for about 10 years.
2224120	2225240	Isn't that cool?
2225240	2226840	That's so cool, right?
2226840	2228600	You can, uh, beat me too.
2228600	2230920	I got my beeper, my pager on me.
2230920	2235880	I'll beep you something funny sometime like eight zero zero eight.
2235960	2238360	Oh, boobs.
2238360	2238600	Yeah.
2238600	2238920	Sheriff.
2238920	2240680	Let's do try to keep things professional.
2241240	2242360	We are federal agents.
2242360	2243400	I'm sorry.
2243400	2247480	That man's beeper channel is a critical piece of national security.
2247480	2249720	Can't be filling it up with security with boobs.
2249720	2254680	Beeper number is, uh, actually, yeah, it's eight zero zero eight one three five.
2256360	2261560	Wooda Baker goes for the high five and then turns her back and starts walking next door.
2263160	2263320	Yeah.
2263320	2264360	We're done with you, Sheriff.
2266840	2268360	Wait, Joe's always got one more question.
2270200	2272920	Wait, let's go to the last question with Joe.
2272920	2274840	You're, uh, you're working here pretty late.
2274840	2276600	Is there something that's keeping you tonight?
2279320	2279640	Sorry.
2279640	2282360	Is it, uh, since when is it bad to love your job?
2282920	2283880	I'm not saying it's bad.
2283880	2287240	I'm asking if there's something on your desk that's taking a little extra time.
2287240	2291000	If loving your job is wrong, then I don't want to be right.
2291000	2292200	You know, exactly.
2292200	2293480	We believe that too.
2293480	2295000	But, uh, what are you working on tonight?
2295000	2296200	What's your job tonight?
2296200	2299160	Just general policing, waiting for calls to come in.
2299160	2299880	I have a staff.
2299880	2302360	I have a staff of 28 deputies.
2302360	2304200	Is there that much crime around here?
2304200	2307480	That's a lot of it's the whole, it's the county, the whole county.
2311320	2312760	No, they're severely understaffed.
2316840	2321240	Yes, I, I have, uh, 28 deputies for a 1200 person town.
2323320	2324760	We're very over policed.
2325000	2325960	That sounds about right.
2326760	2332200	Have all your deputies, have all your deputies been coming in and showing up to work and
2332200	2333080	everything?
2333080	2334840	I would stand for nothing less.
2334840	2335480	Okay.
2335480	2336360	Just making sure.
2337880	2338440	Bye.
2338440	2338760	Bye.
2339400	2340440	I don't trust you.
2340440	2341160	All right, let's go.
2341880	2343000	She don't trust nobody though.
2343000	2343880	That's just her way.
2343880	2345480	Hey, you have a pleasant Eden Sheriff.
2345480	2346200	Thank you Sheriff.
2346200	2347000	Thank you.
2347000	2351480	I love making Thomas play the character that cleans up my social messes.
2351480	2359400	As you leave, he calls out, uh, if you, if you go to the mega deuce, tell him the Sheriff
2359400	2360040	sent you.
2360040	2361080	Oh yeah, we'll do.
2361080	2362040	Wait, hold on now.
2364040	2364840	One more question.
2367960	2369320	You reeled him back in.
2370280	2375800	Now, now Murlsey, he, he owns the competing businesses to the, to the mega deuce.
2376520	2377000	Yeah.
2377000	2377880	Yes sir.
2377880	2381240	Why didn't you tell us to say the Sheriff sent you to Murl's?
2381640	2385880	Agent, have you ever heard of supporting small and local?
2386600	2388440	Just trying to help Mr. Cervantes out.
2388440	2389400	Can I, he meant that?
2389400	2389900	Sure.
2391240	2392360	59 on a 60.
2392360	2396040	Oh, he's not really bullshitting you.
2396040	2397720	It doesn't seem like he's misleading you.
2397720	2402600	He's suggesting you go to like a 24 hour diner and restaurant versus going to a bar with
2402600	2406200	presumably like microwave chicken fingers and stuff.
2406200	2409160	It's actually probably just good advice as far as quality food goes.
2409160	2411640	He's being nice.
2413240	2414520	This devious bastard.
2416680	2417560	Wait a minute.
2417560	2419640	Harlan, I've looked into his soul.
2421560	2425640	I've seen a kind man offering true culinary suggestions.
2425640	2429160	So I believe we should head on a, well, wait, I guess we're going to hit up the city hall
2429160	2429660	first.
2430360	2430860	Bye.
2430860	2431360	Bye.
2431360	2432360	Bye.
2432360	2432860	Bye.
2432860	2433360	Bye.
2433360	2433860	Bye.
2433860	2434360	Bye.
2434360	2434860	Bye.
2434860	2437000	Walking sounds, walking sounds, walking sounds.
2437000	2441800	You walk a whole 30 feet to like the front of city hall.
2441800	2442840	We ring the doorbell.
2445000	2446600	We're playing like a side scroller.
2450120	2451560	Three thugs attack you.
2451560	2452200	All in a line.
2452200	2453800	I move my joystick to the right.
2456040	2458120	So you go to the city hall.
2458120	2461880	It's a nicer, more regal looking building.
2461880	2464440	Clearly the nicest building in town.
2464440	2468360	It's up almost a flight of stairs outside to get kind of in the front.
2468360	2474280	And there's like a large grand foyer as you get in with a reception desk up front.
2474280	2477160	And it happens to be staffed by a young woman right now.
2477160	2481720	How long is the loading screen from when we go inside to when we can see everything?
2481720	2485640	Well, it's the early nineties, so it's probably around eight or nine minutes.
2487000	2487800	But that's good.
2487800	2489960	And you probably had to switch discs in between.
2489960	2490460	Right.
2491720	2493160	Is the young woman Jane Allen?
2494440	2496200	No.
2496200	2497000	Hey, could it be?
2497000	2497960	That would be convenient.
2497960	2498440	Could it be?
2500600	2501320	She was at work.
2501320	2501880	Hot damn.
2501880	2503000	Cracked the cakes.
2503000	2503880	Her mom was right.
2505560	2509240	Her husband and daughter were just working a lot for a really long time.
2510440	2511000	Hi ma'am.
2511000	2511560	Hello.
2511560	2512520	We're agents.
2513160	2516520	Could you point us to Mr. Bradley Allen's office?
2516520	2517480	Ah, the alderman.
2518040	2518680	Yes.
2518680	2519320	That's the one.
2520600	2521640	Let me get him for you.
2521640	2522600	He's in his office?
2522600	2524280	Yeah, he's busy right now.
2525400	2527720	I'll get him for you if you can just hang here.
2527720	2528840	Can I interest?
2528840	2531320	Real quick, we want to go back and ask the sheriff some questions.
2533480	2534200	We do?
2534200	2535480	No, I'm sorry.
2537080	2540200	Real quick, how many of the aldermen are working tonight?
2540200	2542120	Just a couple of them, I think.
2542120	2545240	Is it typical for them to, you know, burn that old midnight oil?
2545240	2546120	It's tax season.
2547240	2549480	You know, alderman and taxes.
2549480	2552200	You know, that's what they say, like peas and carrots.
2552200	2552760	And death.
2553400	2553720	And death.
2553720	2554520	Death and aldermen.
2555400	2556520	That's what they say.
2556520	2556840	Go ahead.
2556840	2557800	I'll go get him.
2557800	2561560	We'll guard the desk for you while you go get him.
2561560	2562280	Thank you.
2562280	2564680	And sorry, you said you wanted to speak to Bradley, right?
2564680	2565080	Yes.
2565080	2565800	Yes ma'am.
2565800	2567400	How many did she say were working?
2567400	2567880	Two.
2567880	2568200	Wow.
2568200	2570120	Do you want a glass of water or anything while you're waiting?
2570120	2572200	Just go get the alderman, please.
2572200	2573960	All right, there's a water cooler over there.
2573960	2575880	If you need anything, the bathroom's right behind you.
2575880	2576200	Thank you.
2576200	2579560	Because you haven't, as far as I know, gone to the bathroom yet since you've been here.
2579560	2580680	I took a shit, dude.
2580680	2582920	That's a real odd thing to say to somebody.
2583480	2586520	Dude, in real Delta Green, are you supposed to take shits?
2586520	2588120	I took a shit right before the meeting.
2588760	2590360	That pre-meeting shit.
2590360	2594360	You have to be careful because you might get disorders related to, like, pooping your pants
2594360	2595160	and stuff.
2595160	2600200	Yeah, no, Luke had that through all, like, a year and a half of our first campaign.
2600200	2601880	So we got a lot of shit jokes.
2603560	2604600	They're usually pretty good.
2604600	2607480	Well, mine was from digging through my own poop, I think.
2608760	2609260	Yeah.
2609820	2611500	There were little spider eggs in it.
2612860	2615900	You can hang out there, water cooler, restroom.
2615900	2618380	I would like to dig around in her desk.
2618380	2619420	Okay, roll me a search.
2621500	2623020	Pass 19 on a 50.
2623020	2624860	Anyone else searching or just that?
2624860	2626300	It's fine if it's just that.
2626300	2627100	I'm not pushing.
2627740	2631900	Well, I think Harlan would be not searching the desk, but peeping down hallways, just
2631900	2633820	kind of getting a lay of the building.
2633820	2636540	Okay, roll me an alertness for that.
2636540	2639260	Cindy is putting on her cardigan and cheaters.
2640940	2642620	I pass my alertness roll.
2642620	2644300	It's a 35 on a 50.
2644300	2648540	All right, alertness, all you see or hear for that matter, she goes up some stairs to
2648540	2652380	some sort of offices upstairs, looking down the longer hallways to the left or right.
2652380	2653420	They're totally dark.
2653420	2655820	There's no movement or anything else.
2655820	2658380	It's probably much busier during the day than it is right now.
2658380	2660060	In fact, the lights are largely off.
2660620	2662860	It's pretty dimly lit, actually, inside.
2662860	2665020	They're conserving those taxpayer dollars.
2665740	2671820	With that search role, you go through her desk, you find her purse, you find standard
2671820	2672460	stuff in there.
2672460	2680220	ID, lipstick, mirror, no cell phone yet, and her name is Jennifer Kahn.
2680220	2683740	You also see that on her desk, on her name tag.
2683740	2684860	K-H-A-N.
2684860	2687580	So nothing out of the ordinary in here?
2687580	2689100	Nothing out of the ordinary.
2689100	2690620	She's gone for a couple minutes.
2690620	2693500	Has she gone for long enough for us to yell after her?
2693500	2694460	Maybe her last name?
2695020	2698380	I was going to do it.
2698380	2701740	You didn't have to ask.
2701740	2708460	While they're making Star Trek jokes, Jodine goes and uses the bathroom.
2708460	2714860	Yeah, after I rifle around her desk, I also go use the bathroom.
2716060	2718220	Okay, great.
2718220	2723020	So after a couple minutes, she comes back, assuming neither of you took that long in
2723020	2726140	the bathroom, you can still be in the bathroom finishing your business if you really want
2726140	2735340	to when she comes back, but she comes back with an alder man dressed neatly in a suit
2735980	2738060	and he introduces himself.
2738060	2740380	Hello there, I'm Bradley Allen.
2740380	2742940	I reach out my hand to shake it.
2742940	2744700	Oh, freshly washed.
2744700	2746220	It's not, I didn't pee on my hand.
2748220	2751180	He did though, but he didn't say that.
2751820	2752540	He just thinks it.
2753100	2753740	Okay, good.
2754620	2755180	It's clean.
2755180	2756380	Roll me a persuade.
2758380	2760220	It's got to beat his smell roll.
2760220	2760860	I got a three.
2762460	2763740	And then against my human.
2765420	2768220	Ah, yeah, that 42 is going to beat your three opposed.
2768220	2768720	I'm sorry.
2770300	2774780	So the first thing, the first impression this guy gets of us is that he shakes his hand
2774780	2782540	and he knows it and he smells it and it smells like asparagus and he's like, oh, yeah.
2782940	2783740	That's bullshit.
2783740	2785740	You guys need to get some different soap in there.
2785740	2789020	Asparagus soap is very odd choice, very odd choice.
2789580	2794140	And then I just kind of fall back a little bit and just look down at my shoes.
2795420	2797660	He wipes it on his suit, his pant leg.
2798220	2801020	Well, what can I help the other three of you with?
2801020	2803260	We are with a special DEA task force.
2803820	2809580	We've got some questions for you regarding, well, frankly, your daughter and her friend,
2810300	2811260	Billy race baby.
2811260	2813180	Oh, would you, is there some more private?
2813180	2813740	We can talk.
2815580	2816220	Yeah, we can.
2816220	2818380	Let's grab one of these side offices right here.
2818380	2822540	I do want to assure you that at this moment, your daughter is not considered a suspect
2822540	2825180	or involved in any criminal activity.
2825180	2827020	Is she okay?
2827020	2828300	We have some questions for you, sir.
2828300	2829900	Can we, can we go into another room?
2829900	2830860	Uh, yes.
2831580	2832860	You're already in one room.
2837340	2838540	One question per room.
2840540	2841980	Let's try out a different one.
2841980	2842700	I'm sorry, sir.
2842700	2847500	The vibes in this room are just, they're kind of assaulting me right now.
2847500	2851980	Could we go to, yes, I can take you to another office if you'd like.
2851980	2855740	Is there one that looked like a nice view of the main intersection, main street?
2855740	2859340	Is there one where you could tell us when was the last time you saw your daughter?
2859340	2861100	That's ultimately what we need to know.
2861100	2862300	No, we don't have one of those rooms.
2862300	2863260	Oh shoot.
2863260	2864860	Well, could you tell us anyway?
2864860	2868780	I can take you to the room where I am pretty evasive with my answers to these questions.
2869820	2871660	Well, I appreciate your honesty.
2871660	2874780	Why don't we go to your office and we'll just, you can evade and we'll
2874780	2877500	humant and we'll see what we get.
2877500	2878300	I'd rather not.
2879020	2882220	Yeah, but we're the DEA, so why don't you show us that office, Alderman?
2882220	2885980	I'd rather go to the room where you don't humant and you just listen to me
2885980	2888300	and take everything I say on face as the truth.
2888300	2890060	Oh sure, that's what we meant by your office.
2890060	2890620	Let's go.
2890620	2891660	We all wink at each other.
2893180	2894460	Do you have something in your eyes?
2894460	2894960	Yeah.
2895660	2896460	Truth.
2896460	2898220	You don't want to look into my partner's eyes.
2899580	2902300	Are you making fun of my lazy eye?
2902300	2905180	Oh, I forgot about Harlan's weird eye.
2906220	2908300	Why don't you show us to your office, Alderman?
2908300	2909980	Yeah, this is uncomfortable now.
2909980	2910620	Mm-hmm.
2910620	2911260	Good.
2911260	2911900	I'm very busy.
2911900	2912460	I have to go.
2913580	2914460	Yeah, we'll go with you.
2915820	2916860	We just follow him.
2920540	2922700	You can just work while we ask you questions.
2922700	2924300	I'm just joshing around, guys.
2924300	2926300	It's hilarious.
2926300	2927020	Face guy.
2928460	2929420	I'm just joshing.
2929660	2930220	That's good.
2930220	2930700	I'm joshing.
2930700	2931500	That's good.
2931500	2935660	So would you say it's been more than two weeks since you saw your daughter?
2935660	2936700	Yeah, probably.
2936700	2938700	What kind of drugs is your wife on?
2939500	2941340	I assume she's just high on life.
2941340	2944060	We're God-fearing people in this town.
2944060	2944560	Okay.
2945180	2948540	We talked to your wife and it doesn't really add up.
2948540	2951100	So you haven't seen your daughter in like three weeks.
2951820	2955900	And that's not normal, but you're fine with it.
2955900	2957020	She's an independent girl.
2957580	2959020	I've been busy at work.
2959100	2960220	I don't think it's that big of a deal.
2960220	2961900	What's been keeping you so busy?
2961900	2962940	It's tax season.
2964140	2966780	Can I human Tim saying, I don't think it's that big of a deal.
2966780	2968060	Also, it's September.
2968060	2969260	It isn't taxi.
2969260	2970940	Same in our County.
2970940	2972860	It is 14 success.
2973500	2975980	62 on a 16 fail.
2975980	2976540	What are we?
2976540	2976860	Okay.
2976860	2977660	I failed mine.
2978300	2978780	Human.
2980220	2982300	Oh no, I got a 99.
2985420	2986380	That's pretty bad.
2986460	2996860	Luke's like, tell me, Luke is now actively working for him with the conspiracy guys.
2996860	2997740	Leave him alone.
2999020	3000060	It all makes sense.
3000060	3001340	Now she's an adult.
3001340	3002700	She can do what she wants.
3002700	3010060	He is not being evasive, but he also has kind of a similar level of deadness.
3010060	3015900	As far as his empathy goes similar to his wife where he is saying it doesn't bother
3015900	3016460	him.
3016460	3020620	It doesn't seem like it bothers him, but he also doesn't seem like he's some like psychopathic
3020620	3021980	serial killer either.
3021980	3024220	So it's somewhere kind of in between that golf.
3024220	3025900	There's something a little not there.
3026620	3028220	It's like Stepfordy.
3028220	3028700	Yeah.
3028700	3031180	And we didn't get that impression from the sheriff.
3031180	3032700	Not to the same extent.
3032700	3033420	No.
3033420	3033900	Okay.
3033900	3035420	This the sheriff was weird too.
3035420	3036220	But a little bit.
3036220	3036540	Yeah.
3036540	3038860	I feel like I was like, what's going on?
3038860	3042300	What does what's going on in your town bother you or is anything in your town bothering
3042300	3042780	you?
3042780	3043020	Yeah.
3043020	3045900	And he was just like, basically everything's peachy keen.
3045900	3046060	No.
3046060	3048220	Wasn't he like, are you saying I'm a bad sheriff?
3048220	3048460	Yeah.
3048460	3050460	But I feel like that was his version of it.
3050460	3056060	Like he got defensive in an attempt to cover up the fact that he doesn't truly believe
3056060	3057500	that anything is wrong.
3057500	3061980	My problem was I tried to ask a leading question instead of just doing a vibe check.
3063900	3065820	We go up to everyone else the rest of the time.
3065820	3067100	We're like, Hey, excuse me.
3067100	3068620	Can I roll vibes on this motherfucker?
3068620	3071100	Mr.
3071100	3075900	Allen, could you describe your daughter's relationship with Mr.
3075900	3076380	Spivvy?
3076940	3078140	Oh, that boy.
3078140	3079420	Boy's no good for her.
3079420	3080540	She's going places.
3081100	3082620	Boy's just dragging her down.
3082620	3084380	But that's why you people were here.
3084380	3085660	Because of him and those drugs.
3085660	3086460	That's what the sheriff said.
3086460	3086700	Yeah.
3086700	3087740	He's a brick.
3087740	3088620	He is a brick.
3088620	3091020	He's like a brick of this new super meth.
3091020	3092140	Drowning her slowly.
3092140	3092860	Yeah.
3092860	3095900	I don't think the civilian is necessarily privy to maybe all that.
3095900	3096620	Oh, you're right.
3096620	3099820	I have a hard time keeping all my information to myself.
3099820	3101020	Here's the deal, Alderman.
3101740	3105580	You say she was hanging out with a boy that you knew was trouble.
3105580	3106220	He's trouble.
3106220	3107820	You say she's going places, though.
3107820	3109980	The Ohio State University.
3109980	3110780	Ohio State University.
3110780	3112540	The Ohio State University.
3112540	3113820	I put in a good word.
3113820	3118860	Isn't it odd that Ohio State University backwards is USO?
3120620	3121980	That's pretty similar to UFO.
3121980	3124140	And that's just a little coincidence I noted.
3124140	3128860	But going on, don't you think it's odd that a boy you do not enjoy, let's put it that
3128860	3133180	way, this spivvy boy, he's been running around with your daughter.
3133180	3133980	You think he's trouble.
3134700	3135900	You say she's going places.
3135900	3136300	Yep.
3136300	3140220	And she's in fact been places unknown for the past three weeks.
3140220	3141580	What are you suggesting?
3141580	3143660	Why aren't you worried about that?
3143660	3146140	Well, that spivvy boy, he's in custody, right?
3146140	3149260	As of yesterday night or this morning, correct?
3149260	3150940	I got nothing to worry about.
3150940	3152300	He's going to stay away from my girl.
3153260	3160780	Do you know anybody that has been abducted around here by aliens or unidentified things?
3160780	3164060	Why does it always have to come back to aliens in this town?
3164060	3164620	Well, you know.
3164620	3166860	You can't just conduct a normal drug investigation.
3166860	3169820	You got to ask the nonsense alien questions, just like every reporter.
3169820	3174380	If you would have ever seen this meth, you would say it's otherworldly.
3174380	3175980	Ah, nice.
3175980	3176860	It's pretty cool meth.
3177500	3182060	Now, can I human him on his...
3182060	3183340	I guess that would be what it is.
3183340	3189180	I want to know if this anger about the UFOs, which the sheriff also demonstrated.
3189180	3192700	Is that legitimate, like hometown pride, like we're the butt of all these jokes?
3193500	3195260	Or is that defensive?
3196460	3198540	Why is everybody asking about aliens?
3201580	3202060	18.
3202060	3202860	Oh, yes.
3202860	3203100	All right.
3203180	3207340	With your 18, you know that they're definitely the butt end of the jokes
3207340	3210460	based on your interaction with the sheriff as well as him.
3210460	3215580	You know, people in authority here don't like their town being looked at as this kind of laughing stock.
3215580	3216540	That makes sense.
3216540	3222540	It's unclear if he's actively hiding anything, but he's definitely defensive about it.
3222540	3222940	Gotcha.
3222940	3224700	But it is just like the sheriff.
3224700	3227500	He's like, I fucking hate that my town is this.
3227500	3231420	And as the town leader, he seems to have a really good reason to feel that way.
3231420	3232780	As far as you know, that's it.
3233020	3235020	Because you didn't crit succeed, Thomas.
3235740	3236140	Hey, man.
3237580	3243180	Hey, just popped in my head.
3243180	3245340	Do you have any tattoos?
3246060	3249740	Or maybe you could show us your arm or your leg.
3249740	3251580	That's a very forward question.
3251580	3252940	Oh, look, I got tattoos.
3252940	3256220	This one is Japanese for diligence.
3256220	3257100	I do.
3257100	3257580	Oh, what?
3257980	3261820	I have May I please.
3263260	3267980	So he takes off his suit jacket that starts rolling up his sleeve like he's going to give blood.
3267980	3270860	And you see right on the inside of his right forearm.
3270860	3274220	He's got one of those sweet infinity sign tattoos.
3274940	3277660	Nice upon closer inspection.
3280700	3282540	Oh, yeah, let me get a closer look at that.
3282540	3284540	We're all just digging our eyes.
3284540	3287420	Woodabaga just grabs his arm and brings it up to all of our eyes.
3287420	3289100	I pass with a 40 on a seven.
3289100	3290460	I got another 99.
3290460	3292460	No, 44.
3293340	3296460	Oh, I passed with a plain old two.
3296460	3300140	You rip his arm out of his socket, but then I am able to get a good look at it.
3301340	3305740	I think you've crit success on, like, every person that you've looked at closely at this point.
3306860	3310700	So the first time on Billy Ray, you definitively saw marks.
3310700	3313580	And then it was Nancy, the mom.
3313580	3313820	Yes.
3313820	3316140	Yeah, definitively did not have it.
3316140	3318940	And he also definitively does not have it.
3318940	3319740	Same with the sheriff.
3319740	3324700	Nowhere on his exposed arms, on his neck, hands, anything that you can see exposed right now.
3324700	3329340	He definitively does not have the same kind of muscle punctures.
3329340	3332940	Sorry, it's just my partner here has tattoos.
3332940	3335660	And then we've been working on this task force with Tan here.
3335660	3338940	So they've all been just razzing me about, you know, when are you going to get yours?
3338940	3339660	When do you get yours?
3339660	3341100	And I'm like, it's 1992.
3341100	3344860	We're like 20 years away from that being really socially acceptable.
3344860	3348060	Just, you know, in a professional job, maybe even 30.
3348060	3351100	If I had to give a rust out cement, that's just what I've been saying to them.
3351100	3355260	So that's why we were really, uh, that's why we wanted to just get all up and look at your tattoo.
3355260	3356940	It's just been on our minds lately.
3356940	3357900	I hope you like it.
3357900	3358140	Yeah.
3358140	3358860	What's it mean?
3358860	3360300	It means infinity.
3360300	3361660	Oh, I thought it was eight.
3361660	3362060	Nice.
3362060	3365820	Oh, that happens sometimes, you know.
3367180	3370620	Do you ever use your computer to look up tattoo ideas?
3370620	3372780	Maybe we could go use your computer real quick.
3373660	3374460	Thank you.
3374460	3374780	Okay.
3375420	3378060	In the office that you're currently in, there is a computer.
3378620	3380540	He can crack it open for you.
3380540	3383180	There's not really such a thing as cyber security at this point.
3383180	3385260	There's not even a login really to get on.
3385820	3392540	And he fires up the 28-8 modem on that computer and you hear that sweet, sweet sound of
3392540	3409340	And, uh, Joe, I think you said you have a AOL account.
3409340	3413580	Character Joe or no, Joe's still rocking an AOL account.
3413580	3414940	Joe's like, this will be confusing.
3414940	3415900	And I was like, no, it's fine.
3416860	3417340	Yeah.
3417340	3418380	It's really confusing.
3418380	3418700	Sorry.
3419580	3423260	Player Thomas, character Joe, you said you had an AOL account?
3423900	3432300	Yeah, it's Joe, capital D-E-A, lowercase n at aol.com.
3432300	3433180	Joe Dean.
3433180	3434460	Okay, great.
3435180	3439820	You log in and then you get the, you've got mail.
3439820	3440060	Okay.
3440060	3441100	Joe Dean clicks his mail.
3441820	3442860	Who's it from?
3442860	3443580	Your AOL.
3444540	3446300	Your AOL.
3446300	3448300	Now it'll probably be from one of my bonds, right?
3448860	3450140	Sounds role-play appropriate.
3450700	3457740	So I've got my rich brother, Jim Dean, uh, and then my mom and my dad.
3457740	3463260	I think this is a really shitty chain email from Jim, especially in 1992.
3463820	3467420	He's probably the only reason I have an internet, like an AOL account right now.
3467420	3471180	Like last Thanksgiving, he was like, yeah, personal computer.
3471180	3474460	The, you know, the nerds came in, wired up my home.
3474460	3477500	I've got, uh, I've got access to the whole world right now, baby.
3478060	3479820	And it's just a shitty AOL chat room.
3479820	3483020	And he made you look like a fool at your own Thanksgiving dinner.
3483020	3488060	So that's a lifelong pattern that I've talked to you about in more vulnerable moments.
3488060	3488940	Agent would have begun.
3488940	3489740	Oh yeah, sorry.
3491980	3493020	Bring that up.
3493020	3496460	Anyway, it's literally just a shitty joke email from his brother, Jim.
3496460	3499580	Do you guys remember any, uh, nineties joke chain emails?
3499580	3500540	It's probably just the,
3500540	3502220	my mom used to fucking love those all.
3502220	3504780	This is like a little bit before that for sure.
3505420	3509180	It's not one of those emails where it's like, if you don't forward this to at least 10 people,
3509180	3510860	you're going to have bad luck kind of thing.
3510860	3511500	Exactly.
3511500	3511900	Yeah.
3511900	3512220	Yeah.
3512220	3512700	It's that.
3512700	3516700	And then it's also a lot of, uh, weird proto Clinton conspiracy jokes.
3519020	3521340	Joe Dean's like, man, I hope this doesn't, you know,
3521340	3525900	take weird route in the public consciousness so that a lot, you know, anyway, I hope this
3525900	3528300	doesn't sink a really viable candidate.
3529020	3530300	Hey Joe, here's that card.
3531900	3533580	I hand you the business card.
3533580	3535500	I hope this country doesn't hate women enough.
3536300	3537500	Watch the skies.
3537500	3538780	Orange piece of shit.
3538780	3540220	AOL.com.
3541820	3542860	I'm done with my musings.
3542860	3543580	Well, what do you do?
3543580	3545500	What do you do with that email address?
3545500	3547660	Well, Joe Dean, he's like, I got this boys.
3547660	3551180	Watch this over to like compose mail or whatever.
3552140	3555980	Types in the email address, subject line, D E.
3556060	3556300	Hey.
3562220	3569500	And he says, hello, I'm in Grover's Ville for a few days.
3570140	3572700	Curious, uh, re UFOs.
3573500	3575020	Wanted to ask you some cues.
3575580	3578620	You can get back to me here or just set a time that we meet.
3578620	3581180	Cause I don't know if we're going to get access to the email again.
3581180	3582300	That is such a good idea.
3582300	3585100	I was like, oh, I've been wondering about that the whole time.
3585100	3587100	Like this, how do we get a computer again?
3587820	3590700	This conspiracy dude is going to love it if I'm just like, yeah.
3590700	3590940	Yeah.
3590940	3593500	Meet at the mega deuce at noon tomorrow.
3593500	3596780	Sincerely, John Dean, federal agent.
3596780	3597500	Aggressive.
3597500	3599340	I want him to think I might know things.
3599340	3599900	What's that?
3599900	3601820	A with the circle around it.
3601820	3602940	That stands for at.
3603500	3604300	Asked and answered.
3605740	3607580	It's called an apostrophe.
3607580	3608860	I think I believe that's correct.
3609500	3610540	Email was sent.
3610540	3611180	Yep.
3611180	3612460	You've got mail.
3612460	3613100	Ooh.
3613100	3614060	Auto reply.
3614060	3615500	Oh, it's my fucking brother again.
3619420	3621260	Did you get two messages perhaps?
3621260	3621900	Oh, I did.
3623740	3625420	Look, the Dilbert guy messaged us back.
3626780	3627340	You.
3627340	3627820	Yes.
3627820	3630700	Did get an auto reply straight to your email.
3630700	3633900	So auto reply, uh, read D E Hey.
3633900	3641420	And in the body of the email, it says I'm out of the office for at least the next couple of weeks.
3642220	3645900	Investigating what's happening in Grover's Ville.
3645900	3648940	I will get back to you at my earliest convenience.
3648940	3653260	Signed Scott Adams, not the creator of Dilbert.
3654060	3658300	And he gives a address in Knoxville.
3658300	3660860	Is there a telephone in this office we're in?
3660860	3662620	There is in fact a telephone in this office.
3662620	3663660	Are you going to call that address?
3663660	3666140	No, I'm going to call the number that was on the back of the card.
3666140	3667580	Uh, hold on, hold on, hold on.
3668140	3669980	Is the alderman still in the office for this?
3669980	3670460	Yeah.
3670460	3673820	Sir, you're, we're going to have to commandeer your office for the next, uh,
3673820	3677100	roughly 10 minutes, uh, for an urgent federal business.
3677100	3678940	Uh, we're about to call our boss.
3678940	3679980	We need to commandeer your phone.
3679980	3681260	Could you please step outside?
3681260	3685180	Cindy will start walking out the door with him alongside Jodine.
3685180	3686220	You're escorting him out?
3686220	3686380	Yeah.
3686380	3687820	We just started escorting him out.
3687820	3688940	But yeah, it's okay.
3688940	3691420	But yeah, it's just only for a little bit.
3691420	3692060	You're all right.
3692060	3692700	It's okay.
3692700	3693420	You got busy.
3693420	3695420	Remember you said you had to get back to work, right?
3695420	3696060	Yeah.
3696060	3696540	10 minutes.
3697340	3699260	But that other alderman's wondering where you are.
3699340	3700220	Probably got to talk to him.
3701340	3701740	Okay.
3701740	3702460	I'll wait.
3702460	3706380	You know, do you need to ask me any more questions or should I just go back to work?
3706380	3707500	Now you can fuck off.
3707500	3708000	Thanks.
3708940	3709660	Great meeting you all.
3709660	3710380	But wait.
3710380	3712940	Except for she realizes she's wearing the cardigan.
3712940	3714140	She's like, Oh, wrong voice.
3714140	3714860	Ah, dammit.
3717660	3717900	Okay.
3717900	3718540	He fucks off.
3718540	3721740	He goes upstairs back doing whatever he's doing upstairs with taxes.
3721740	3724620	And you're gonna make that phone call?
3724620	3725100	Yes.
3725100	3731100	I'm dialing beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
3731100	3733260	No, I need rotary phone sounds.
3733980	3740460	Oh, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
3740460	3741180	All right.
3741180	3743900	Now I need that trademarked ring that you guys do.
3743900	3744860	Oh, so well.
3744860	3745820	We'll put it in.
3749020	3750380	I don't think I've ever actually heard this.
3750380	3751580	I'll do it in post Taylor.
3751580	3752080	Really?
3752540	3753980	Thomas doesn't listen to the show.
3753980	3755340	No, I'm not allowed to listen.
3755340	3758060	I need to do a re-listen, but sorry.
3758060	3759020	It's one of my favorite parts.
3760060	3761740	Everybody talks about it on the forums.
3761740	3764380	And it's from an episode I was not previously allowed to listen to.
3765580	3767020	It's it's good stuff.
3767020	3773980	You call it rings once or twice, and then you get that dial-up modem sound on the back end.
3775900	3778380	Sort of like when you call a fax machine or something else.
3779100	3780540	Not ringing like a normal phone.
3780540	3781180	Listen to this.
3781740	3782620	What's happening?
3782620	3785420	It's a, that sounds like a fax machine.
3786060	3789740	It looks like maybe he was expecting documents of some sort.
3789740	3790380	I hang up.
3791100	3793020	Should we fax him something?
3793020	3795020	Is there a fax machine in the alderman's office?
3795020	3795500	There is.
3795500	3797340	I write what you wrote in your email.
3797340	3797980	You send that.
3798700	3799740	It bounces back.
3799740	3800780	Fax unable to send.
3800780	3801340	It's not.
3801340	3802860	So apparently it's not a fax machine.
3802860	3804460	It's actually a modem on the receiving end.
3804460	3806220	Does that just mean he's on the internet?
3806220	3806460	Yeah.
3806460	3806620	Yeah.
3806620	3807180	Okay.
3807180	3811260	So Joe doesn't know why a person would write down an internet address,
3811260	3813100	modem address on a piece of paper.
3813100	3814940	But, uh, my character probably would.
3814940	3815740	It's a no, no, no.
3815740	3816140	He didn't.
3816140	3816620	He didn't.
3816620	3816860	He.
3816860	3819900	So remember back in the day, you couldn't use the phone if you were connected to the internet
3819900	3820780	or like, yeah.
3820780	3821740	Oh, that's what you're saying.
3821740	3823740	It's it's like we, yeah, exactly.
3823740	3824540	Gotcha.
3824540	3825180	Well, okay.
3825180	3827260	You used to get just to get a busy tone if that happened.
3827260	3830540	Oh, maybe in 1992.
3830540	3831820	I mean, who has computer science?
3831820	3832220	I do.
3832220	3834380	Who are you calling when you were three years old?
3835660	3836220	You can wait.
3836220	3837020	You can roll me some.
3837660	3839660	But you don't have to answer this, but how old are you?
3839660	3841180	I was born in the mid eighties.
3841820	3842140	All right.
3842140	3842300	Yeah.
3842860	3844140	I'm the oldest one here.
3844140	3848780	And I remember AOL at age six, uh, doing exactly this.
3848780	3851660	If you picked up the phone line in the household, that's what you heard.
3851660	3855180	But if you called into that house, it was just dial tone.
3855900	3858940	That's a fail 73 on a 50 computer science.
3858940	3860940	Well, you have a 50 anyway, you would know this.
3860940	3862460	This is one of those like base.
3862460	3864620	Hold on for Joe's information.
3864620	3870860	That means the call is coming from inside the house in this building using the internet.
3871180	3871980	Or it's just us.
3875900	3878300	I log off of AOL and we make the call again.
3880860	3881420	Oh my God.
3881420	3882780	It was a puzzle this whole time.
3882780	3886780	David, we just had to get off the internet puzzle.
3888700	3891580	You are the ones that killed all those people.
3893260	3893740	Damn.
3893740	3894460	And that's it.
3894460	3895020	We're done.
3895020	3896300	I inspect my own arm.
3897580	3898540	You're the aliens.
3898540	3900940	We're all covered in tiny little needle marks.
3901980	3904060	You call that happens.
3904060	3904380	Okay.
3904380	3906060	Maybe you're right in real life.
3906060	3908140	It would be a busy signal in this world.
3908140	3912220	The way the technology works, that means it's, it's logged in.
3912220	3914700	That's the point of that you're supposed to get.
3915500	3921020	I will give you something else just cause no one has, uh, the telecommunications,
3921020	3922940	uh, networking skill.
3922940	3929980	One thing you would notice that phone number is area code nine three one, which is not
3929980	3931980	a Knoxville phone number.
3931980	3935340	So it's a different area code than the phone number on the footer of his email.
3935340	3937980	Nine three one is the area code for this County.
3937980	3939900	So it seems to be a local number.
3939900	3943260	He might be staying at the same motel we're staying at.
3943260	3943740	Oh yeah.
3943740	3947100	Let's just go ahead and can we call Merle's the front desk?
3947900	3951740	Cause I assume there's a phone book in here or we have there is a phone book.
3951740	3956620	So, um, let's, let's call Merle's and ask if, uh, if the Scott Adams is standing there
3956620	3957740	and if he created Dilbert.
3960540	3961420	Bring, bring.
3961420	3962060	Merle's shut eye.
3962060	3963340	How can I help you?
3963340	3966860	Hey, this is one of the Sheriff's, uh, down at, uh, this is one of the deputies
3966860	3968620	down at the Sheriff's office.
3968620	3971980	Have you got a Scott Adams stand with y'all?
3972940	3974140	Uh, let me check.
3974140	3976220	And you hear some papers in the background.
3976220	3979020	Um, yeah, we got a, we got a Scott Adams here.
3979020	3983420	Um, he's been here for a hot second as the kids say.
3983420	3985340	Let me check the records.
3985340	3987020	Oh, do they say that yet?
3987020	3987660	They do here.
3987660	3990540	This is, this is actually the town it originates in, in the early nineties.
3991740	3998220	Eventually proliferate elsewhere, but give me a hot second and yes.
3998220	3999580	Oh no, he's been here.
3999580	4003980	Uh, he has been, he's been here for a couple of weeks now.
4003980	4007340	It looks like he's paid up for three more nights.
4007340	4008380	What's his room number?
4008380	4008940	I'm sorry.
4008940	4013820	Uh, who is this asking specifically about, uh, people saying at this, uh, motel that
4013820	4016940	I probably should ask that before, um, I just give away information like this
4016940	4018060	willy nilly on the phone.
4018060	4022140	Oh, deputy Clark down from the, the Groversville Ferris department.
4022140	4023740	Your deputy Clark.
4023740	4026860	Well, I'm new in case there's a deputy Clark, you know, and don't like.
4028140	4028780	Oh, okay.
4028780	4028940	Yes.
4028940	4030380	That's why they got me on the night shift.
4030380	4030700	Yeah.
4030700	4031260	That okay.
4031260	4031820	That makes sense.
4031820	4032300	Sure.
4032300	4033260	Um, yeah, no, no, no.
4033260	4033900	He's here.
4033900	4037180	Uh, he has two rooms down here at the motel.
4037180	4039180	Two rooms and all these unpaid parking tickets.
4039180	4041660	What a, which is what we're after him for.
4041660	4043260	He's paid up for three more days.
4043260	4044860	He should have paid his parking tickets.
4044860	4051820	He has one room he's staying in and, um, there is a second room, uh, for storage
4051820	4054460	of research materials, whatever that means.
4054460	4054860	Wow.
4054860	4058860	He just put all that on his book and yeah, it's all, it's all here.
4058860	4059500	And what was your name?
4059500	4060780	I'm the manager by the way.

4067820	4072220	Well, I was deputy, uh, you remember and I will, you have a pleasant night.
4072220	4074460	Hey, ask him about the UFOs.
4074460	4075660	You liked that UFO stuff?
4077340	4080300	Why is it always about the UFOs?

4112060	4114700	I thought this stuff helped anxiety.
4116380	4119580	It must be something inside of me.
4119580	4126300	Does anybody know why I can't get high?
4126300	4134140	I can't sit though I can't and I don't want to try.

4155980	4161980	Hallucinations so big time but spiders out the night.
4161980	4163980	Spiders out the night.
4163980	4171980	Breathing in, breathing out.
4171980	4179980	I've been hiding in low low places with some funny looking dudes with some fucked up faces.
4180940	4187820	And I can't help but feel it I'll always be at the bottom.
4187820	4217660	I think I'm allergic or something better gone with nothing so I won't get high.

4291500	4297500	And I can't help but feel it I'll always be at the bottom.
