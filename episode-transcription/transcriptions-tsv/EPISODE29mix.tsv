0	4380	Peace and blessings to all of our listeners here on KITI City Radio, where the only thing
4380	8100	softer than my chin is the K in our name.

13300	19340	Let us slide right into what is, personally, to me, my favorite segment, in my opinion,
19340	20500	within the show.
20500	25180	It's time for, Hey There Steve, where listeners here in the city can send in thoughts and
25180	30540	opinions to be read by me, your host, now and forever, Steve N. Smith.
30540	32520	Steve N. Smith, your host.
32520	36380	This listener has been all over the internet advocating for pretending to be people, a
36380	38700	show that is near and dear to my heart.

155520	157740	Someone Still Loves You, Boris Yeltsin.
168780	198660	Hi, my little friend is full of
198660	201840	peanuts and jelly.
201840	215140	They always are making good snack taste period.
215140	216140	I think we nailed it.
216140	217140	Question mark?
217140	220140	All right, welcome to pretending to be people.
220140	223780	I feel bad now.
223780	226900	Yeah, well, that's Justin.
226900	227900	Hi.
227900	231180	Yeah, Justin's here for this episode.
231180	233180	We've got Thomas here as well.
233180	234180	Hi.
234180	240820	And things are a bit off the rails here, part of this show, so we're going to see what happens.
240820	244800	Okay, so should we talk about the fact that this is the first time we've recorded an actual
244800	247620	playing session in nearly six months?
247620	249180	I guess we should.
249180	254020	It's been nearly six months since we've recorded an actual session of us playing.
254020	259460	Yeah, the last thing that happened to us was the events of episode 28, I think, or
259460	260460	27?
260460	262260	27, 28 was the Q&A.
262260	263780	Gotcha, yeah.
263780	269020	So we haven't recorded anything since late last year, so we're getting back into it.
269020	270500	We're getting back in the swing of things.
270500	273660	This is the first time you'll hear an episode that we recorded recently.
273660	274660	Yeah, so hopefully our-
274660	277460	It's all the Red Dead Redemption talk in the last episode.
277460	281220	Yeah, hopefully our references are more up to date from here on out.
281220	282540	But we're excited to be back.
282540	285920	The response to the podcast so far has been overwhelming and flattering.
285920	287340	It's made our knees weak.
287340	288340	Yeah.
288340	289940	Justin, has it made your knees weak?
289940	290940	Maybe.
290940	291940	Maybe.
291940	293500	Well, it's made my knees weak, Zach.
293500	296820	No ifs, ands, or maybes about it.
296820	300380	Maybe and, all right.
300380	301380	No but.
301380	302980	I think we should hop right in.
302980	310500	I think we're at a pretty intense situation right now, so let's dive into it.
310500	312340	John Lee Pettymore IV.
312340	317820	This massive room reeks of blood and piss and other bodily fluids.
317820	322780	The pervasive music as well as the thunderous jeering and overall debaucherous crowd noises
322780	327200	have died off, leaving only silence in this cavernous chamber.
327200	330740	Looking down, you see the limp, lifeless body of Keith Vigna.
330740	336540	His jaw is broken off and hanging loosely below a shattered cheekbone that has allowed
336540	342900	one of his eyes to dangle gently off the side of his expressionless face, almost reaching
342900	345780	the blood-soaked concrete floor.
345780	354780	Yeah, so Pettymore stifles some vomit when he sees that, and he takes a moment and he
354780	361660	says, Keith, I know we had our differences, but you didn't deserve to have your jaw ripped
361660	366900	off in your eye, took out, no matter what you did to my smokies.
366900	372020	And I close his remaining eye and move on.
372020	377740	Across the room, you see an inert Clark Bishop slumped halfway out of his broken metal cage.
377740	383380	One of the bars seems to have snapped off into Clark's sternum, and it's a real chest-specific
383380	388400	Phineas Gage situation, what with the bar going in one side and clear out the other.
388400	393400	The bar is kind of propping up Clark's corpse, which is staring across the room at you, cold
393400	394400	and unblinking.
394400	399760	Oh Clark, you were the only one of us worth a damn.
399760	401800	I'm sorry, friend.
401800	406320	The crowd that filled this room moments before has rushed out the only exit, the double doors
406320	412500	on the same wall as the bar, but you see the last two bloodthirsty patrons trying to stealthily
412500	416480	exit the room by creeping together along the wall.
416480	420000	Justin, what does your fellow look like?
420000	427000	In my mind, I have weird, slightly overweight, but just the belly, maybe has a little vest,
427000	429320	like the penguin suit kind of thing going on.
429320	430320	Absolutely.
430320	432760	And what did you say, like an ascot?
432760	434120	Is that like the necktie thing?
434120	435120	Ascot seems good, yeah.
435120	439840	Yeah, like an ascot and a really ill-fitting suit that's like, everything's just a little
439840	440840	too tight.
440840	441840	It looks very uncomfortable.
441840	444320	Does it fit poorly or does it fit ill?
444320	445320	Both.
446160	449000	He, yeah, like too tight of pants.
449000	451360	Oh, that's an ill-fitting suit, dude.
451360	452360	Bro.
452360	453360	Sick.
453360	455360	Fucking sick ass penguin suit.
455360	459840	That's too tight.
459840	467140	And next to that guy is a man dressed very, very similarly who looks very similar, but
467140	470520	the colors that he's wearing are inverted of yours.
470520	471520	That's the way to do it.
471520	472520	That's how twins do it.
472520	473520	That's how twins do it.
473600	478960	And we both have blood just pouring down our mouths onto our cheeks.
478960	479960	Delicious.
479960	485000	We're like looking at it as we're like sliding around the wall, like trying to get away,
485000	488320	trying to just sneak past this one standing person.
488320	491920	John Lee Pettymore points at them and he says, you hold it right there, you blood-eating
491920	492920	sons of bitches.
492920	496720	Oh, and you've got Keith's tiny but powerful gun in your hands.
496720	499360	Pointed right, the noise of cricket pointed right at him.
499360	500360	I mean, I'm scared.
500360	503120	I'm horrified, always horrified.
503120	505160	Even without the gun, I would have been...
505160	506160	Oh my.
506160	510960	I want to approach him and conk their heads together cartoonishly.
510960	519560	Upon doing so, the two sit cross-legged staring up at you.
519560	522120	My good sir, what do you want from us?
522120	523800	We're just trying to leave.
523800	524800	Leave what?
524800	525940	What the hell is going on here?
525940	529540	The greatest party that you've ever seen, have you not?
529540	531560	It wasn't so great from the cages.
531560	537480	Now, one good cop and one other man is dead.
537480	538880	And I want some fucking answers.
538880	540040	Why are we here?
540040	541460	Why were you drinking our blood?
541460	542460	What is this?
542460	546520	Oh, how could you not be partaking in this delicious juice?
546520	548560	Yes, do you want some?
548560	549560	Come right down.
549560	551120	There's plenty on the floor for all.
551120	556080	I conk their heads together again.
556080	558700	I don't want none of your damn people juice.
558700	560080	I want answers.
560080	561560	You best start talking immediately.
561560	567680	Well, I mean obviously you're in Marvin Glass's den of sin.
567680	571680	Yeah, why do you drink the blood?
571680	572680	Why wouldn't you?
572680	576740	It's delightful life-giving powers.
576740	581040	It tastes good and it makes us feel better on the inside.
581040	584240	I don't know why you're kink-shaming me here.
584240	588080	I'm just wanting to drink some boy juice.
588080	596720	Now listen, John Lee Pettymore is a sexually awake creature and he understands that the
596720	600720	spectrum of human pleasure is broad.
600720	606880	But the second it becomes a problem is when you, without consent, start drinking, minding
606880	607880	my partner's blood.
607880	611000	Well, you guys seem to be useless people.
611000	614840	You definitely whipped your dick out and tried to piss on me.
614840	615840	Yes.
615840	616840	It seemed like you were a willing participant.
617600	618600	Now who's kink-shaming?
618600	620520	If you would like to do that again, please.
620520	622760	Yes, we would quite enjoy it.
622760	626240	I would actually like to pee all over E2 right now, but my dick is broken.
626240	628240	I don't think I could pee.
628240	629240	Yeah.
629240	634320	Okay, conk.
634320	638320	How are you so blissfully unaware of everything that's happening here in the city?
638320	643520	Well, I come from a town where some pretty fucked up shit has been going on.
643520	645240	Oh, you're not from here.
645640	646960	Oh, he's not from here.
646960	648160	No, I'm not from here.
648160	649400	Rich, did you hear that?
649400	650960	He's not from here.
650960	651960	Rich.
651960	653960	It sounds like y'all want me to ask you what your names are.
653960	658200	Well, it's awfully rude of you to clonk our heads so many times without asking us what
658200	659200	our names are.
659200	660200	All right, what are your names?
660200	661960	Well, I am Rich.
661960	665160	And I'm Richard Nichols.
665160	666240	Dick Nichols.
666240	669040	Dick Nichols and Rich Nichols at your service.
669040	670560	I conk their heads together.
670560	673360	All right, now that we've been properly introduced.
673360	674820	What's your name?
674820	676860	My name is none of your goddamn business.
676860	681700	Where do you hail from, stranger that pisses on other strangers?
681700	682700	Contention.
682700	683700	That's a-
683700	689140	Why do you- what's that evil laugh for?
689140	692460	Well, we don't hear stories of contention.
692460	694300	What have you heard?
694300	701140	No, just that the police force there might be the most inept in all of the land.
701140	702540	That part might be true.
702540	705140	Not really.
705140	708540	Why does Marvin Glass hate you so much?
708540	714020	That part, well, because he took a bunch of his money and drugs.
714020	716500	Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
716500	718220	No, that's a rude thing to do.
718220	719220	We didn't know.
719220	720220	Marvin-
720220	723060	Well, okay, so I've- I mean, like, I found the drugs, right?
723060	725320	I just found them sitting there, so I sold them.
725320	726460	That's Finders Keepers.
726460	728340	I don't know why he can be so mad about that.
728340	729340	I don't know.
729340	730340	Are they his drugs?
730340	732420	No, because somebody had stolen them from him.
732420	733420	I don't follow.
733420	736660	Well, so, like, there were two steps removed from Marvin.
736660	738140	Also, it's drugs, man.
738140	739140	Like-
739140	741060	Rich, does that seem enough steps removed for you?
741060	748340	I'm very curious about this Finders Keepers rule you bring up.
748340	753580	I tend to be a Keepers Keepers sort of man myself.
753580	755760	I think Rich is agreeing with you.
755760	757540	If you keep it, it's yours.
757540	758540	I didn't.
758540	759540	I sold it.
759540	760540	That's why Marvin's so mad.
760540	763700	Keith, my dead friend, see the eyeball dude over there?
763700	765260	Oh, it's delectable.
765260	766260	Oh my.
766260	767260	Erotic.
767260	768260	Yes, it was.
768260	769260	Okay, I conk him.
769260	772260	Can we go now, please?
772260	773260	No.
773260	778580	You've got- you've got many conkings ahead of you yet, weird little fuckers.
778580	786860	Okay, I see- I can see you like that, so- listen, what the- what do you two do in the
786860	787860	city?
787860	788860	Oh, we're security advisors.
788860	789860	In fact-
789860	791380	We're the best of the best, I would say, brother.
791380	792940	We are the best of the best.
792940	793940	The best of the best.
793940	800420	So much that the greatest man in the city, Marvin Glass, hired us to create the security
800420	802820	for this entire denizen.
802820	809820	Since all the denizens of this palace of horror and sin have fled and terror, many are dead,
809820	814540	and the prisoners, me, have escaped, it doesn't seem like you are the best of the best.
814540	817100	Also, you're being held at gunpoint right now.
817100	818500	Yeah, that's a fair point.
818540	819540	That's a good point.
819540	820540	He makes a good point.
820540	821740	How secure is this place?
821740	823420	I guess not very secure.
823420	824900	Can you protect us?
824900	825900	Maybe.
825900	826900	Please?
826900	827900	Listen.
827900	831380	Oh, pretty please, stranger.
831380	837020	We know how to use the security system in this place, and we could get you out of here.
837020	843060	And we may love watching death, but we are, how do you say, not into dying.
843060	846340	Alright, well, first of all, it's gonna cost you.
846340	847340	How much?
847340	848340	Five million dollars.
848340	849340	What?
849340	853180	That's such a large number.
853180	855260	Rich, do we have that much money?
855260	858020	I don't think so, brother.
858020	859700	But I do wish so.
859700	861220	Tell you what, if we-
861220	863940	Wait, wait, hold on.
863940	871460	You guys got the contract to install security throughout this entire supervillain's lair.
871460	876260	You're dressed like millionaires with a bunch of other rich people literally lapping up
876260	879180	the blood of commoners.
879180	881020	And you're telling me you don't have money?
881020	883100	No, we have money.
883100	885820	It's tied up, it's not liquid.
885820	888660	You wouldn't understand.
888660	891060	I happen to be a man of means myself.
891060	893420	I might understand more than you think.
893420	894420	Interesting.
894420	902780	So you propose that you kill us, and then you die here, or we help you escape, and you
902780	905420	pay us lots of money?
905420	906420	No.
906420	907420	Hmmmm.
907420	911100	No, that's not, that's not, you're not listening.
911100	912100	I propose-
912100	913900	I think we know exactly what's going on here.
913900	915340	I propose that you pay me-
915340	916340	For what?
916340	917340	To not kill you.
917340	918340	Oh.
918340	919340	Oh.
919340	920340	No, go ahead.
920340	921340	I don't care.
921340	922340	Do you want to get out of here alive?
922340	923860	We have the ability to make that happen.
923860	928900	It's not a strong negotiating tactic to give up what you want, so I think I don't care
928900	929900	either.
929900	930900	Okay.
930900	934300	I'm gonna shoot you in the knee now.
934300	935300	And then I shoot you in the knee.
935300	936300	Oh no, brother!
936300	940300	Oh my, can you see it?
940300	941300	Conk.
941300	942700	He's like licking at his knee.
942700	945660	I conk you so you can't lick your own blood.
945660	949060	Oh, let me get in there, brother.
949060	953020	Please, get that tongue inside me.
953020	954020	Let's move on.
954020	955020	Yeah, I don't know-
955020	964820	My knee hurts, god damn.
964820	969500	But we still can help you out of here if you're willing to part with some of your apparent
969500	970500	money.
970500	972820	No, I mean, I can probably get out.
972820	976100	I'd help you guys not die though, if you pay me.
976100	977100	That's pretty much my offer.
977100	978100	Okay, sounds good.
978100	979500	We'll give it to you later.
979500	982740	Yes, we pinkies will.
982740	984700	Do you hold out your pinkies, eh?
984700	985700	No.
985700	986700	Butt.
986700	989300	I hold out my butt.
989300	991980	We put our pinkies in your butt.
991980	992980	All right.
992980	993980	It's a deal.
993980	994980	Gentlemen's cake.
994980	998140	Now we've sworn the old-fashioned way.
998140	1002060	All right, five million dollars.
1002060	1008340	That's what that stinky finger promises.
1008340	1010580	Good lord, man.
1010580	1016500	Hearing a voice near Clark Bishop's shish-kabobed corpse, you look over and see a hunched man
1016500	1020840	wearing an old tattered robe with a hood that covers his face.
1020840	1029620	The voice is crackly and muttering something ancient and jaunty.
1029620	1035720	A bright light begins to form under the hood that is obfuscating this being's face.
1035720	1041200	As it reaches its hands into the light, the hood is drawn back, and this old man rips
1041200	1045840	an unnaturally bright light out of his familiar face.
1045840	1052660	A much older Clark Bishop takes his beaming hands and reaches deep into the chest of the
1052660	1059080	Clark Bishop you've known before yanking out the bar and throwing his younger self's body
1059080	1062520	over his shoulder.
1062520	1076840	Before you can act, in a flash the length of a blink, both Clark Bishops are gone.
1076840	1078160	Roll sanity.
1078160	1079160	93.
1079160	1080160	Whoo!
1080160	1083960	Go ahead and lose one.
1083960	1085440	What's that put you at?
1085440	1086440	23.
1086440	1087440	Whoo!
1087440	1088440	You are going down.
1088440	1090240	Okay, and my breaking point is 20.
1090240	1094800	Oh my god, brother, that was so interesting.
1094800	1100920	That was one of the stranger things I've ever seen.
1100920	1107860	Was that your, what, did your, your man friend just disappear with another man?
1107860	1115200	He's not my man friend, he's my friend man, and again, I think that an old man and a dead
1115200	1117920	man can just both sneak out of here.
1117920	1118920	That they did.
1118920	1120840	Dog shit at your jobs, guys.
1120840	1121840	The security here is non-existent.
1121840	1126960	We've agreed that maybe we could have done a little bit more.
1126960	1129160	Maybe we would have made more money.
1129160	1137360	That's true, delicious money.
1137360	1139600	Did you mention that you were from Contention?
1139600	1141520	I did.
1141520	1143000	What you been hearing about Contention?
1143000	1146480	Well we do know one man from Contention, I heard tell.
1146480	1153200	He was a, god, he was such a lush, he came in, he was trying to get into the VIP section
1153200	1154200	here one night.
1154200	1156960	They just don't let anyone in there.
1156960	1160240	No, and he was this dumb, small looking man.
1160240	1166960	I mean, he was like balding and round and I believe, Kevin, what was his name?
1166960	1167960	I can't remember.
1167960	1170760	Anyway, he said that he worked for the government.
1170760	1174800	I was here, I was pretty lit, weren't we, Rich?
1174800	1176880	That is always my dear brother.
1176880	1181960	And we were, I mean, just on the verge of it, right?
1181960	1187600	And he starts talking about how he's been in a coma, whoop-de-doo for him.
1187600	1191440	And we were like, why does that mean that you should be in the VIP section?
1191440	1195600	And he said that he was having visions while he was in this coma.
1195600	1200600	And we said, yes, we have visions all the time.
1200600	1202520	What's your favorite vision that you've had?
1202560	1207000	Oh, I couldn't say, brother, not in front of a stranger.
1207000	1208000	No, tell me.
1208000	1209000	Completely agreed.
1209000	1210680	They're too personal.
1210680	1217680	And this man, I mean, he had the audacity to post about his visions online, online.
1217680	1221360	It's like sharing your mind diary with the public.
1221360	1222360	It's so absurd.
1222360	1226840	And the government got a hold of it and they sent some man named, oh, what was the name
1226840	1228000	he kept saying?
1228000	1230360	Agent Victor, I believe?
1230360	1231880	Victor, I think it was.
1231880	1233440	It was so odd.
1233440	1237920	He said that this Agent Victor paid him a visit and he was the one who told him about
1237920	1243240	the mind probing device that apparently ISIS is using now to give people vision.
1243240	1246280	So he said, claimed he was now like in the know.
1246280	1247280	Hold on.
1247280	1248280	ISIS?
1248280	1249280	Yeah, ISIS.
1249280	1250280	Like ISIL?
1250280	1251280	Like Daesh?
1251280	1252280	Sure.
1252280	1253280	Whatever.
1253280	1255280	I'm not much for current events.
1255280	1257480	ISIS has mind control technology.
1257480	1259800	Isn't that the worst news you've heard today?
1259800	1260920	I just don't believe it.
1260960	1261960	I don't know.
1261960	1264360	I understand why you didn't let John Peters in your place.
1264360	1266880	He seems like a raging lunatic.
1266880	1267880	Yeah.
1267880	1269360	Everyone from contention is.
1269360	1270360	Okay.
1270360	1272560	Well, I shoot him in the other knee.
1272560	1276380	Can we go now, please?
1276380	1279160	My brother's leg is so hurt.
1279160	1281320	I am in such deep pain.
1281320	1284920	I'd love to take care of it for him outside of here.
1284920	1286960	I love the pain.
1286960	1290400	That's a conkin.
1290400	1291400	That's a conkin.
1291400	1292400	That's a conkin.
1292400	1293400	Oh, that?
1293400	1294400	That's a conkin.
1294400	1297480	That's his dang conkin, boy.
1297480	1305920	Richard Nichols stands up and with the help of his brother, he says, sir, we, we must,
1305920	1307320	we must go now.
1307320	1311400	Otherwise I, the security will be here any moment and we need to go through these double
1311400	1312400	doors.
1312400	1313400	It's the only way out.
1313400	1314680	Are you going to pay me not to kill you?
1314680	1318920	We are absolutely going to pay you.
1318920	1324920	All right, well, I feel like you're not, but I don't want to get killed either.
1324920	1327960	So you can get me past the security here.
1327960	1332440	Uh, let's, let's get moving, but I want to find some place, some things out about this
1332440	1333440	place first.
1333440	1340400	So you guys walk up through the double doors and into a long wide hallway with tall ceilings.
1340400	1346280	The floor, ceiling and walls are made out of black marble, making depth perception difficult.
1346280	1351080	Your eyes take a second to adjust and you see at the end of the hallway is an elevator
1351080	1352080	door.
1352080	1356960	There are also two doors about 10 yards away from you, one on each side of the hallway
1356960	1362640	above the elevator is a dial that is slowly moving from the left to the right side.
1362640	1363640	Oh no.
1363640	1364640	Oh my.
1364640	1365640	Oh God.
1365640	1366640	The elevator.
1366640	1367640	It's coming down here.
1367640	1368640	It's coming down here.
1368640	1369740	Someone's on their way.
1369740	1371460	This can't be good, brother.
1371460	1373420	Oh no, no, no, no.
1373420	1374420	Okay.
1374420	1375420	Okay.
1375420	1376420	Let's um, you're, you're Richard, right?
1376420	1377420	I'm Richard.
1377420	1378420	And you're Dick.
1378420	1379420	Yes.
1379420	1380420	But rich.
1380420	1381420	Yes.
1381420	1384980	No, I'm Dick and Richard and I'm also rich and Dick.
1384980	1385980	Dickard.
1385980	1386980	Okay.
1386980	1387980	Dick.
1387980	1390700	Why don't, why don't you look away real quick?
1390700	1391700	Okay.
1391700	1392700	I execute.
1392700	1398900	Dick, I'm sorry, but your brother's a creep and a liability.
1398900	1402700	And uh, unfortunately I shot him in the knee to prove a point, but that just slowed him
1402700	1403700	down.
1403700	1406780	Uh, so that's why I had to shoot him just now.
1406780	1410880	If you'd like to take a moment and lap up his blood before you run through one of these
1410880	1421940	doors with me, I'd understand brother, I need it now.
1421940	1423820	I start lapping that bad boy up.
1423820	1424820	Okay.
1424820	1425820	Okay.
1425820	1426820	All right.
1426820	1427820	That's while sobbing uncontrollably.
1427820	1428820	That's enough.
1429740	1430740	Go.
1430740	1431740	We got to go.
1431740	1433740	A little bit more of my brother's blood, please.
1433740	1438260	I squirt a little bit from his knee into, I just, I just squeeze.
1438260	1439260	Oh boy.
1439260	1440260	All right.
1440260	1441260	Okay.
1441260	1442260	Dick.
1442260	1443260	Are you ready?
1443260	1444260	Like a blood fountain?
1444260	1445260	Like you squeeze it up into?
1445260	1446260	Yeah.
1446260	1447260	Like a blood Capri Sun.
1447260	1450420	Or like a hose when you like spurred it so it'll go into your mouth.
1450420	1451420	Exactly.
1451420	1453740	Is that, Hey, is that enough of your brother's blood?
1453740	1458380	I raise my blood soaked face up and I go, I think that has to do for now.
1458940	1459940	All right.
1459940	1463940	So I'm going to take the price down to 2.5 fair is fair and uh, let's get the fuck out
1463940	1464940	of here.
1464940	1467820	Oh, I guess that will have to do.
1467820	1472780	I'm still holding like the blood up to like the little spurt up to my mouth a little bit.
1472780	1478140	I conk him against his brother's corpse head and I'm like, we do not have time.
1478140	1479140	It hurts.
1479140	1480620	Let's go, Dick.
1480620	1481620	You guys don't have time.
1481620	1482980	Do you go left or right?
1482980	1483980	Left.
1483980	1484980	All right.
1484980	1485980	Wait, no, I mean he, where do we go?
1485980	1486980	Sorry.
1486980	1491500	I'm not super familiar with the map, but I'd say left is probably good.
1491500	1492500	Oh, left then.
1492500	1493500	God damn it.
1493500	1495620	Did I kill the wrong brother?
1495620	1498180	You very well may have my friend.
1498180	1499180	All right.
1499180	1501060	Get us through the door.
1501060	1502060	Let's go.
1502060	1508340	There's a touch screen next to the door and Rich begins fumbling with it and let's see
1508340	1509340	here.
1509340	1510340	I don't remember properly.
1510340	1515220	It was something like, and the door opens inside this door.
1515220	1522340	You walk into a small empty foyer that leads to four more doors and the door closes behind
1522340	1523660	you.
1523660	1527780	You've got one door on your left, two ahead of you, and one on your right.
1527780	1534620	They are labeled Kevin, Francis, Charles, Rosemary.
1534620	1536740	Oh my God.
1536740	1540660	What a potentially informative set of doors.
1540660	1543060	I would like to go into Rosemary's door.
1543060	1544460	I can help with that.
1544460	1550620	If I remember correctly, it was something like this, but my dear brother always used
1550620	1554380	to do this door, but I'm doing this in his honor.
1554380	1556720	And the door opens.
1556720	1563580	This room contains three things, a bed, a popcorn machine, and a television screen the
1563580	1568580	size of an entire wall that is currently playing an episode of Happy Days.
1568580	1569580	That figures.
1569580	1572100	The popcorn machine is an oddly whimsical touch for Rosemary.
1572100	1574580	I'll take a moment to reflect on that.
1574580	1577980	Is there any way to tell where Rosemary is in the building right now?
1577980	1579340	I don't think so.
1579340	1585500	We usually don't track people so much as capture them and, you know.
1585500	1587140	Make them fight for bloodsport.
1587140	1588140	Yes.
1588140	1589940	All right.
1589940	1591300	These guys seem to be really into blood.
1591300	1592900	Could I drink some blood for willpower?
1592900	1596540	I've never- They're really talking up it's healing benefits.
1596540	1600580	They really are talking up it's healing powers.
1600580	1602380	I did leave the- Do you drink some blood?
1602380	1605860	Well, we left the source in the hallway with a guard.
1605860	1606860	Oh, yeah.
1606860	1612340	I lick Rich's face.
1612340	1615100	I know you were going to like it, Rich.
1615100	1616100	I know.
1616100	1617100	Just let me- You were correct, Seth.
1617100	1620180	Stop wiggling so much and let me get some of this blood.
1620180	1626860	And as he's wiggling, he moves the pillow on the bed and under it, there's a picture.
1626860	1627860	Yeah.
1627860	1628860	I think I know who it is.
1628860	1629860	Oh, really?
1629860	1630860	Yeah.
1630860	1631860	Is it Marvin Glass's boy?
1631860	1632860	It is.
1632860	1633860	Mm-hmm.
1633860	1634860	It absolutely is.
1634860	1635860	Yeah.
1635860	1636860	I had some suspicions about Rosemary's motivations.
1636860	1643500	Rosemary has a picture of a slender, muscular man in a black t-shirt and black tactical
1643500	1644500	pants.
1644500	1649620	He has tribal tattoo sleeves on both arms going down his hands and fingertips.
1649620	1651500	This guy seems cool.
1651500	1657340	There's a sharpied heart around this man's face, which is stoic, almost blank.
1657340	1662900	And she has written Rosemary Glass all over it.
1662900	1664900	Rosemary.
1664900	1666060	Yeah.
1666060	1669460	If we all get out of this, I do hope you find the love you seek someday, Rosemary.
1669460	1672260	I'm going to give you 10 luck for calling that.
1672260	1673260	Oh, thank you.
1673260	1674260	That puts me to 55.
1674260	1675260	Congratulations.
1675260	1679540	And we talked about how we haven't recorded since September.
1679540	1684420	I've been thinking about that for the next ... I'm like, oh shit, I think I know why
1684420	1687000	she sent us for the gun.
1687000	1693480	In the background, as soon as you get that luck, you hear Fonzie go, aye.
1693480	1694480	Thank you.
1694480	1695480	Thank you, Fonz.
1695480	1696480	Seemed right.
1696480	1697760	At the exact right time.
1697760	1698760	Exactly.
1698760	1703440	Rich, have you watched Barry on HBO with Henry Winkler?
1703440	1706680	I can't say I watch TV very often.
1706680	1707680	It's excellent.
1707680	1708680	You should check it out.
1708680	1712920	He does a great job as Gene Cusinow, the head of the acting theater.
1712920	1716480	John Lee Pettymore IV endorses Barry on HBO.
1716480	1718000	Go check it out.
1718000	1719000	Timely references.
1719000	1720000	Exactly.
1720000	1722200	The season's on right now, y'all.
1722200	1726060	Actually, it won't be by the time this goes to air.
1726060	1727060	Always behind.
1727060	1728060	Always.
1728060	1729060	All right.
1729060	1730280	I want to go into Kevin's room now.
1730280	1731400	Did y'all hire Kevin?
1731400	1733000	Do you know much about Kevin?
1733000	1737720	Rich, I think Kevin would have been around for as long as you've been there.
1737720	1740560	He's always been Marvin Glass's number two security.
1740560	1741560	Okay.
1741560	1744480	Kevin Glass is number two security, not head of security for the building.
1744480	1745480	I guess both.
1745480	1746480	Yeah.
1746480	1747480	He's like his right-hand man basically.
1747480	1748480	Okay.
1748480	1751080	Oh, I've known Kevin for quite a while.
1751080	1753840	He was always Marvin's number two.
1753840	1755160	Interesting.
1755160	1762840	You didn't happen to have any involvement in, say, making people like Rosemary unkillable
1762840	1763840	in any way?
1763840	1769320	Or, well, I guess it was Keith's brother who might have raised all those mutant children.
1769320	1771320	Anyway, did you make Rosemary immortal?
1771320	1772800	Or do you know that she might be?
1772800	1775080	I can't say we had any part in that.
1775080	1781840	We mostly stuck to the doors and whatnot.
1781840	1791120	When you go into Kevin's room, you guys leave and go into Kevin's room, it is the epitome
1791120	1792360	of minimalism.
1792360	1795680	There is a full-sized bed neatly made in the corner.
1795680	1798080	There's a chest of drawers against the wall.
1798080	1800640	And the only other thing in the room is a desk with a chair.
1800640	1803200	I'm not in great shape.
1803200	1804200	No, you're not.
1804200	1806640	You're just stumbling around.
1806640	1807640	What's in here?
1807640	1808640	You've got blood.
1808640	1809880	It's just smearing.
1809880	1813880	Also, you're still in your underwear from the fighting that took place.
1813880	1816860	You got your underwear in the cages.
1816860	1819120	You're welcome, listeners.
1819120	1824640	And then you were in the cage with Keith, and then you fell out, and you've been fighting,
1824640	1825640	and there's blood everywhere.
1825640	1828720	I've got the goo of the guy that I landed on probably.
1828720	1829720	Oh, just all over you.
1829800	1830800	You've got toenails.
1830800	1831800	Yeah.
1831800	1838760	So you're slip-sliding around all over this place, and when you check the desk, you grab
1838760	1844360	onto it, and you do notice that there is a different texture underneath the desk than
1844360	1845560	there is on top of it.
1845560	1847400	I'd like to feel around under the desk.
1847400	1853200	When you feel around, the texture is, it seems like someone's carved into the bottom of the
1853200	1854200	desk.
1854200	1856520	Rich, get under there.
1856520	1857520	Tell me what this desk says.
1857520	1861080	That's what I love doing is getting under things.
1861080	1866840	And as you get under it, you see that the phrase, not Kevin, has been carved into the
1866840	1873840	bottom of the desk over and over and over and on top of itself repeatedly.
1873840	1877720	Not Kevin.
1877720	1878720	That's weird.
1878720	1881080	You sure that's what it says?
1881080	1882080	Check again.
1882080	1883080	I'm looking at it.
1883080	1884080	It's very unsettling.
1884640	1889040	Rich, go ahead and roll Sanity for me.
1889040	1892040	I always fail.
1892040	1895840	Do you want to look at anything else in this room?
1895840	1897760	Yeah, I want to look under the bed.
1897760	1899000	I'd like to pop under the bed.
1899000	1900000	Rich, look under the bed.
1900000	1901000	As you wish.
1901000	1903760	That's why you're here, Rich.
1903760	1905720	Well, I'm just leaning against the wall.
1905720	1907200	Bending hurts right now, so.
1907200	1908200	That makes sense.
1908200	1909200	Oh, yeah.
1909200	1913000	Oh, my broken dick.
1913000	1917080	Rich, under the bed, you find a notepad.
1917080	1919840	Seems to be some kind of notepad under here.
1919840	1920840	Pass that here, Richard.
1920840	1922000	I slides it.
1922000	1928600	On every page, it says, quote, I had the same dream again last night.
1928600	1931640	She just says, I'm so sorry.
1931640	1933380	He's just so beautiful.
1933380	1935160	You don't have to do this.
1935160	1936360	We can leave.
1936360	1939300	We can run.
1939300	1943740	On every page of the notepad.
1943740	1947780	I've heard that, but I don't know if John Lee Peddingmore's heard that or if I've heard
1947780	1948780	that.
1948780	1949780	John Lee Peddingmore.
1949780	1950780	Okay, where did he hear that?
1950780	1951780	It was in your dream.
1951780	1952780	Oh, right.
1952780	1953780	And I recognized him.
1953780	1954780	Okay.
1954780	1960280	So John Lee Peddingmore recognizes the words on the page from his dream, and a chill runs
1960280	1961500	down his spine.
1961500	1964940	Just a sickening recognition, but it shouldn't be there.
1964940	1973580	As Rich gets up from crawling under the bed, he bonks his head on one of the chested drawers,
1973580	1978640	and he's like, ooh.
1978640	1984540	And he sees that there's carving underneath this drawer as well.
1984540	1986220	Rich, what's it say?
1986220	1992220	It says, Mary in the woods, over and over and over.
1992220	1994220	Mary in the woods.
1994500	1996700	Kevin's a real focused guy, you know?
1996700	1997700	Yeah, he seems to write.
1997700	1998700	He gets on one thing.
1998700	2003980	Yes, I was going to say lots of repeated phrases and such.
2003980	2004980	It's interesting.
2004980	2005980	It's a style.
2005980	2006980	You know, it's a choice.
2006980	2011420	I wouldn't make it, but you gotta, you know, you gotta explore your own artistic avenues.
2011420	2014620	Can I see what, like, I want to check all the drawers on this desk now and see.
2014620	2019940	Every single drawer in the chested drawers says Mary in the woods carved over and over
2019940	2021380	and over again.
2021380	2023820	Mary in the woods.
2023820	2026780	To the point to where, like, the wood is thin.
2026780	2028620	And Kevin's an intense dude.
2028620	2034680	Yes, I've known Kevin a while, and I would say intense is one of the few adjectives I
2034680	2039100	know about him.
2039100	2043420	You're handling the death of your brother pretty well.
2043420	2045900	Well, he'll always be with me.
2045900	2058860	We went right back to being a little freak right away, so I appreciate that.
2058860	2064020	Alright, let's go through these other rooms here.
2064020	2065940	As you wish, sir.
2065940	2068100	Let's go into Charles' room.
2068100	2069580	As you wish, sir.
2069580	2073820	This room looks like it was a set used on Mad Men.
2073820	2078780	Everything is beautiful, but it smells like someone spilled a vat of Everclear in here.
2078780	2084040	There is a well-stocked bar, and the closet is full of different uniforms and disguises.
2084040	2087340	There is a computer, and there are a shitload of tabs open.
2087340	2093500	They are all about the town of contention, different businesses, and maps to Hotel Motel,
2093500	2096260	John Peters' house, and the Piston Pig Farm.
2096260	2097260	The pig farm.
2097260	2098260	The homeless.
2098260	2100660	Damn it, what does it all mean?
2100660	2103140	There's an email open as well in one of the tabs.
2103140	2106540	If only I could read.
2106540	2108660	I read the email.
2108660	2114460	So there's actually nothing in his inbox, but there is one email still in the drafts
2114460	2115460	folder.
2115460	2124940	The email details that Rosemary and I, Charles, found the gun that turned Alfred mad in the
2124940	2126620	possession of a young girl.
2126620	2129740	A chase ensued, and she got away.
2129740	2133940	He also adds that there are more strange items that are in contention, and he thinks that
2133940	2135860	they should try to collect them all.
2135860	2136860	Interesting.
2136860	2141980	So poor Tilde B had a run-in with Charles before she met us.
2141980	2144460	No wonder she didn't trust us.
2144460	2146580	Plus, fuck the police.
2146580	2147580	Yes.
2147580	2149540	Yeah, he knows what I'm saying.
2149540	2153180	I guess that explains why she was so nervous when she saw us.
2153180	2157140	Okay, on to the last room, Richard.
2157140	2158140	Richie.
2158140	2159140	Dick.
2160140	2161140	Wouldn't you like to know?
2161140	2164780	Yes, that's why I just asked.
2164780	2169140	The last room is Francis, and this room is a fucking disaster.
2169140	2173640	Clothes have been tossed onto every surface, the bed, the floor, the armoire, everywhere.
2173640	2178740	The walls are made out of whiteboard that is filled with equations.
2178740	2183040	There's a single drawing of a sphere, one inch in diameter.
2183040	2184300	This person seems smart.
2184300	2187780	I bet they're not related to Keith.
2187780	2189500	Do you know anything about these equations?
2189500	2190900	I can't say that I do.
2190900	2194500	I've never been much of a math man myself.
2194500	2197860	I'd like to do an intelligence roll and see if I can decipher what any of this is about.
2197860	2198860	Okay.
2198860	2202500	I mean, I didn't typically apply myself in school, but I did have a head for figures,
2202500	2205140	and I was an AP Calculus.
2205140	2209580	This is...
2209580	2210580	Last name.
2210580	2213220	Really inspired me.
2213220	2214220	You know, I was a pretty rough...
2214220	2215220	You know what?
2215220	2216220	You don't care about this, but...
2216660	2218660	I'm always interested to hear a good story.
2218660	2220780	All right, well, picture this.
2220780	2224500	We were both butt naked, naked on the bathroom floor.
2224500	2225500	I did.
2225500	2228660	Yeah, that's unfortunately why Mrs. Lastname got fired.
2228660	2230980	All right, I'm rolling...
2230980	2233180	Oh, an intelligence roll to see if I can figure out...
2233180	2234180	Add a negative 20.
2234180	2235180	The negative 20.
2235180	2236180	32.
2236180	2237180	I passed.
2237180	2241580	My intelligence is 75, so I'm rolling on a 55.
2241580	2249740	These equations are built to perform some sort of mathematics that do not exist in this
2249740	2251080	world.
2251080	2256860	She is coming up with solutions that do not make sense with the math that you know to
2256860	2258340	be absolutely true.
2258340	2260340	Go ahead and roll sanity for me.
2260340	2261340	Three.
2261340	2262340	I passed.
2262340	2263340	Fuck.
2263340	2267060	No, honestly, like, I kind of...
2267060	2268060	I don't know.
2268060	2269060	So this makes sense to you.
2269060	2272500	You were looking at math that doesn't make sense, and you were starting to realize with
2272500	2276620	everything that you've seen in this world that the math that you grew up with is not
2276620	2280540	the math that actually exists in this reality.
2280540	2281540	Richard, this...
2281540	2282540	Hold on.
2282540	2286380	Okay, I'd like to do a search roll in this room.
2286380	2287380	Okay.
2287380	2288380	Five.
2288380	2289540	Oh, shit.
2289540	2292240	These dice are all over the place.
2292240	2294500	That means they're working.
2294500	2295500	So when you...
2295500	2298340	What did you do to my dice, you piece of shit?
2298340	2299980	When you...
2299980	2305260	Looking through the room, you start moving some of the clothes out of the way, and underneath
2305260	2308100	a shirt or something, there's a picture.
2308100	2312420	There's a picture of Frances with a man and a woman who are older than her.
2312420	2317380	It looks like a family picture, like it's her parents, and her father, the Duke, has
2317380	2320660	his eyes crossed out with X's from a Sharpie.
2320660	2321660	Teen angst.
2321660	2322660	We've all been there.
2322660	2323660	We have.
2323660	2325520	Until Mrs. Lastname got ahold of me.
2325520	2328260	Really turned me around.
2328260	2329860	More ways than one.
2329860	2330860	Hot.
2330860	2331860	Yeah.
2331860	2332860	Uh-huh.
2332860	2339620	All right, well, this room of this precocious teen mind seems to have revealed all it can
2339620	2340620	to me.
2340620	2342180	Let's keep moving, Richard.
2342180	2343180	Yes.
2343180	2345900	You've now gone into all four rooms in this quadrant.
2345900	2347900	The only door is back into the hallway.
2347900	2348900	All right, Richard.
2348900	2349900	Follow me.
2349900	2350900	Peek your head out there.
2350900	2352020	Make sure the coast is clear.
2352020	2359420	When you peek your head out, you see there are four men dragging this limp body behind
2359420	2367980	them, and each of them are wearing full brown jumpsuits, and they have a large scythe strapped
2367980	2374100	to their backs, and the blade of each scythe is shaped like an enormous fishhook.
2374100	2375260	How bloody is it?
2375260	2378820	None of the fishhooks have any blood on them.
2378820	2380580	Mm, disappointed.
2380700	2382540	You might want to take a look at this, friend.
2382540	2383820	I peek my head out.
2383820	2387460	When you peek your head out, you notice that the body that they are dragging behind them
2387460	2393340	is the body of Keith Vigna, and they walk into the elevator, and the elevator door closes
2393340	2394460	behind them.
2394460	2396140	Where all does the elevator go?
2396140	2398700	Anywhere your heart desires.
2398700	2400300	Hmm.
2400300	2402540	Like, really, though?
2402540	2405340	Could I just think about a person I want to see in this building?
2405340	2408540	I meant within the building's bounds.
2408540	2409540	Okay.
2409540	2413420	Do you think we could find Rosemary?
2413420	2414420	Mayhaps.
2414420	2415420	Where would she be?
2415420	2416660	Where's, like, security control?
2416660	2418820	I believe I could take you there.
2418820	2420060	It's across the hall.
2420060	2421060	Let's go.
2421060	2426380	When you guys go across the hall, there's also a touchscreen, yeah, Scooby-Doo shot
2426380	2431220	of you guys running across the hall to the other door that looks the exact same, using
2431220	2434340	the same, what are those called in cartoons?
2434340	2435860	Frames of animation.
2435860	2436860	Sure.
2436860	2437860	Yeah.
2437860	2441700	It's, like, on a loop of us walking, and...
2441700	2448700	And you guys do the same thing, where you, like, hack into the keypad, and the door opens,
2448700	2455340	and inside this door, you walk into a small, empty foyer that leads to two doors, one on
2455340	2457260	your left and one on your right.
2457260	2458780	Neither one has a label.
2458780	2459780	Oh, good.
2459780	2460780	I don't...
2460780	2462140	I think labels are generally harmful.
2462140	2463700	Me as well, friend.
2463700	2464700	Where...
2464700	2465700	You guys have so much in common.
2465700	2466700	Alright, let's not.
2466700	2467700	I don't...
2467740	2469740	I'm becoming quick friends with you.
2469740	2470980	Rich, no.
2470980	2471980	That's not what's happening.
2471980	2473660	You know, you took my brother.
2473660	2476140	You could fill in a little bit here for...
2476140	2477140	Oh, yeah, sorry.
2477140	2481940	When you guys walked out into the hallway, they saw you, and...
2481940	2482940	No, Richard...
2482940	2484940	And they killed both of you.
2484940	2489140	Richard's body was still, you know, just limp on the floor.
2489140	2491300	Just figured I'd remind you of what you've done.
2491300	2495580	Thank you for making me relive these delicious and horrible memories.
2496100	2498780	Do you want to go in the left door or the right door?
2498780	2499780	Left door.
2499780	2502940	You walk into a room that is long and narrow.
2502940	2507580	Each wall is made entirely of deep, tall file cabinets.
2507580	2510940	Above you is only fluorescent lighting.
2510940	2513260	On the far end of the room is a table.
2513260	2518660	It looks like a desk but is four feet off the ground and has no accompanying chair.
2518660	2522660	There is a file open on the standing desk or super wide podium or whatever.
2522660	2523660	I go to read it.
2523740	2527660	It's a file that says John Lee Pettymore the Fourth on it.
2527660	2533660	It shows you as a cocaine supplier, number one, and a contention police officer, number
2533660	2535100	two.
2535100	2539740	There's a lot of stuff about the Pettymore family.
2539740	2544900	Different troubles that cousins and uncles and aunts have all gotten into.
2544900	2547500	And then there's a manila envelope.
2547500	2552060	When you open the manila envelope, it's adoption papers.
2552060	2559700	From Cole's Orphanage, New School Under Modern Etiquette, and the name of the adopted child
2559700	2562460	is John Lee Pettymore the Fourth.
2562460	2565180	What?
2565180	2566900	I pour over the paper.
2566900	2569220	Does it show my birth parents or anything?
2569220	2570780	It has your adopted parent's name.
2570780	2572660	It doesn't have your birth parent's name.
2572660	2575040	So that's pretty stunning.
2575040	2576040	How old was Kevin?
2576040	2579420	He was probably mid-50s, mid-60s.
2579420	2580420	That's my daddy.
2581140	2583820	I want to take a look and see if I can find a file for Kevin.
2583820	2592140	Actually, right underneath the file for John Lee Pettymore, there's a file labeled K-Cell.
2592140	2598660	Three members of an unknown organization who go by Kyle, Karen, and Kevin.
2598660	2601260	Kyle is listed as unknown.
2601260	2603700	There's a blurry picture attached of a man.
2603700	2606180	The picture is from a security camera.
2606180	2610400	Karen is listed as Anne Love.
2610400	2616480	There is a mug shot of a woman smiling a cold, vacant smile behind asymmetrical bangs
2616480	2619040	covering one of her eyes.
2619040	2622480	Kevin is listed as unknown.
2622480	2624080	There is a picture attached.
2624080	2629240	He's missing the surgical scars and is so much younger and happier than Kevin, the man
2629240	2635080	you saw earlier, who is now only a hollow shell of the man in this picture, the man
2635080	2639280	you immediately recognize as your father, John Lee Pettymore the Third.
2640720	2648600	Okay, so Copperhead Road starts playing by Steve Earle and John Lee Pettymore gets, he's
2648600	2658160	stunned and he's kind of, the paper is shaking in his hands and he's like, daddy, daddy,
2658160	2660040	you ain't dead.
2660040	2662800	The G-Men didn't kill you.
2662800	2663800	You're alive, daddy.
2671400	2681920	Also, in this file, there is a miniature tape player with a cassette loaded into it.
2681920	2684680	I nervously press play.
2684680	2691680	The cassette begins playing and you hear that whirring of an old recording and you hear
2691680	2698720	a voice that you just recently met and you recognize as Marvin Glass.
2698720	2707720	I do not typically reward my adversaries with the honor of joining my family, but if
2707720	2716880	either of you are willing to give up any information on your associate who stole my property, I
2716880	2721360	would be willing to let you live.
2721360	2723240	Fuck you, you goddamn monster.
2723240	2725040	You and your kind can eat my ass.
2725040	2727480	No, no, no, please.
2727480	2728840	How are you doing this?
2728840	2730720	Kyle, I swear I'm not doing this.
2730720	2733200	He's controlling my- BANG!
2733200	2742280	The sound of a gun firing is followed by silence.
2742280	2743840	What are you?
2743840	2752200	Tell me how this little ball works and I'll tell you what I am.
2752200	2754440	The recording ends.
2755440	2758440	Little ball.
2758440	2760440	Goddamn.
2760440	2766440	I guess this mystery is a lot older than December 3rd.
2766440	2770440	Hey, Rich, did you hear any of that?
2770440	2771440	Mm-hmm.
2771440	2772440	What is this?
2772440	2773440	Yeah.
2773440	2774440	Sorry, man.
2774440	2784000	I just heard like some life shit, like my daddy, who I found out is my adopted daddy,
2784000	2787280	who I thought had died and abandoned me.
2787280	2789400	He's alive.
2789400	2791400	He's Kevin.
2791400	2794800	Oh, interesting.
2794800	2798520	Were you around- did you work for Mr. Glass at this time period?
2798520	2799520	Did you know anything?
2799520	2804000	No, I can't say I was around whenever this was.
2804000	2806960	Like is this- does it seem- is it like A through Z or whatever?
2806960	2807960	It's not.
2807960	2808960	It's all over the place.
2808960	2810320	Do you want to go ahead and roll a search for me, though?
2810320	2811320	Yeah.
2811320	2812920	I've got one thing for you if you roll.
2813320	2815920	Sorry, it's a zero and a two.
2815920	2817160	Fuck yeah.
2817160	2821800	You quickly just rifling through trying to find anything interesting.
2821800	2828360	There's a bunch of files that are itemized by like number and letter coding, stuff that
2828360	2831720	doesn't make any sense, but there's one that's just called Satan.
2831720	2834040	I'd like to read this file called Satan.
2834040	2836400	Yeah, there's one thing in it.
2836400	2842320	It's just a picture and it's of a woman with shoulder length curly hair and a mouth that
2842320	2848840	not only takes up half of her face, but it's showing an amount of unbridled pleasure you
2848840	2856480	can barely comprehend, and you feel like it might be important later.
2856480	2859160	This is a deeply unsettling photograph.
2859160	2864320	It is, and I would like you to roll sanity.
2864320	2865640	Thirty-one, fail.
2865640	2868000	Alright, lose one sanity.
2868000	2869000	Twenty-two?
2869000	2870000	Yes.
2870000	2872200	I'd like you to roll an alertness check for me, John.
2872200	2873680	The same age as Taylor Swift.
2873680	2878560	At least he has a song called Twenty-Two.
2878560	2880840	Thirty-four on a sixty.
2880840	2882760	Fuck, I just missed it.
2882760	2883760	No, no, I passed.
2883760	2884760	You passed.
2884760	2885760	Yeah, you passed.
2885760	2886760	Hell yeah.
2886760	2888720	You hear the elevator door ding.
2888720	2896360	I grab Richard Rich, whichever you prefer, Dickie, and throw him behind the table with
2896360	2897360	me.
2897360	2898360	I'm like, get down.
2898360	2899360	Okay.
2899720	2906040	As you hide, you hear footsteps, and then you hear the door to the foyer that you're
2906040	2913200	in open, and then you hear someone right on the other side of the door of this room that
2913200	2922400	you are now in, and the door opens, and Kevin is standing there, dressed in all black, average
2922400	2928080	build, six feet tall, light brown hair, mustache with a dead stare and scars on his forehead
2928080	2929600	and neck.
2929600	2937800	The scars look medical in nature, and he is all gussied up with an assault rifle, a shotgun,
2937800	2938800	a pistol.
2938800	2941000	He's wearing body armor.
2941000	2943760	Body armor that you recognize.
2943760	2945680	We came in with our body armor.
2945680	2950960	Yep, and he's holding the assault rifle that you specifically chose to bring to the city
2950960	2952680	with you.
2952680	2956400	Nature versus nursery right there, you know what I'm saying?
2956400	2957400	Woo!
2957400	2963920	And he starts shooting, and he fires this assault rifle.
2963920	2967320	We're behind a big solid four foot wide thing, right?
2967320	2973960	I just motion to Rich, don't make a fucking move, and I'm just hoping he's just firing
2973960	2974960	blindly.
2974960	2975960	I don't want to make a move right now.
2975960	2981280	So he keeps firing and firing, clip empties, you hear it hit the ground.
2981280	2985840	He loads in another clip, and he starts firing again.
2985840	2988520	Woo!
2988520	2994600	And as he's firing, you start feeling this podium chip away.
2994600	3000720	A few bullets actually whiz through near your heads right in between the two of you.
3000720	3001720	Okay.
3001720	3007440	I want to wait until I hear him go through another clip, and as soon as I hear him reloading,
3007440	3011640	I'm going to kick Richard out into the open.
3011640	3014080	Fair, fair.
3015080	3017360	A clip hits the ground.
3017360	3020240	I kick Richard rolling out behind the podium.
3020240	3026440	I'm in the fetal position, so I literally roly poly out into the fetal position.
3026440	3030800	And I'm not saying anything, I'm just hoping maybe he just recognizes one of the guests
3030800	3031800	and will...
3031800	3040160	John, you turn to your right and you see the body of Rich Nichols turn into cheese, basically.
3040160	3044240	It's shredded through with lead flying all the way through it.
3044240	3051480	I would say roughly 18 shots go through the body of Rich Nichols, and he is flopping about
3051480	3052940	on the ground.
3052940	3057940	He shits his pants, he starts throwing up everywhere and gurgling blood.
3057940	3063400	And as he's gurgling blood, you are my new best friend.
3063400	3068240	Live, Dammit, live.
3068240	3071080	Earn this.
3071080	3080240	All right, so while he's focused on just lighting up Rich, I want to roll around the other end
3080240	3083140	and take some shots with the noisy cricket.
3083140	3084680	Roll firearms.
3084680	3086800	25.
3086800	3087800	What's your firearms?
3087800	3093200	My firearms is a 60, that would make it a 40, so I'm good.
3093200	3094960	Roll 2d10 for damage.
3094960	3096960	Oh, fuck.
3096960	3100240	Oh, fuck indeed, that's a noisy cricket, my dude.
3100240	3101240	Add up the numbers?
3101240	3102240	Yes, please.
3102240	3103240	17.
3103240	3104240	No, wait, no.
3104240	3106680	Yeah, no, because a 10 is a 10, right?
3106680	3107680	A zero is a 10.
3107680	3110280	Oh, a zero is a 10, so eight.
3110280	3111280	Wait, what?
3111280	3112280	I rolled a 10.
3112280	3113280	Oh, yeah, that's a one.
3113280	3114280	Right.
3114280	3115280	That's what I'm...
3115280	3116280	Yeah.
3116280	3117280	All right.
3117280	3118280	Or a 71.
3118280	3121680	710 points of damage.
3121680	3129640	Eight damage, so you fire at Kevin and he takes it in the shoulder and part of his shoulder
3129640	3136840	rips away and underneath it you see some sort of, it's not bone, it's some sort of shiny
3136840	3144600	material underneath his shoulder and he stands firm and begins firing at you as you are firing
3144600	3145600	at him.
3145600	3146600	I take my shots.
3146600	3149940	They turn my daddy into a goddamn mechanical man.
3149940	3157580	And as you say that, he turns the assault rifle onto you and begins firing, landing
3157580	3160260	11 points of damage.
3160260	3162140	That takes me down to one hit point.
3162140	3165940	At one hit point, the body of John Lee Pettymore hits the ground.
3165940	3169660	I need you to roll a constitution check to stay conscious.
3169660	3176500	32 on a 50, so does Khan go down with willpower?
3176500	3177500	Yes.
3177500	3178500	Okay, so I fail.
3178500	3179500	You fail.
3180060	3183940	Kevin turns a sort of sickly black for you.
3183940	3191620	The camera pans out and sees Kevin walk over to the body of John Lee Pettymore.
3191620	3201100	There is no remembering in his eyes and he fires his assault rifle into your chest for
3201100	3209340	a full clip and the body of John Lee Pettymore is just gyrating on the ground.
3209380	3218740	The blood is spattering everywhere and Kevin is standing above you with a cold, dead face
3218740	3225420	with no remorse and no understanding of what he was doing.
3225420	3227600	That still seems like I couldn't come back.
3227600	3229260	You said you're going to spend the luck.
3229260	3230260	Yeah.
3230260	3238040	The world is dark, but you still feel very much alive.
3238040	3241800	You actually feel something very specific.
3241800	3249280	You're moving like go-gurt busting out of a plastic tube by pressure alone.
3249280	3257720	You feel yourself squeezed out of a dark constricting space onto the cold, hard floor and rolling.
3257720	3263920	Then your limbs extend from your form and slam into the file cabinet walls on either
3263920	3265020	side of you.
3265020	3272020	It gives you the leverage you need to fling your silver, round frame at your target.
3272020	3278580	As you land, one of your appendages slices into the soft tissue on the back of your dad's
3278580	3279580	neck.
3279580	3285660	Another snaps his head forward and you feel the fracture as a third reaches in, gripping
3285660	3292100	the top of the spine where it meets the head, or the C1 vertebrae, and you rip the entire
3292100	3299620	spinal cord out of his body in one swift motion, promptly forcing yourself into the
3299620	3306620	now-vacant spinal column of John Lee Pettymore the Third.
3306620	3308780	Cool.
3329620	3353700	How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the
3353700	3354700	walls?
3354700	3355700	There's no fire at all.
3355700	3356700	No fire at all.
3356700	3357700	Fight, fight, street me down Takes me back to where you're from
3357700	3358700	Don't stop a dying love Don't push on to your own
3358700	3359700	Don't stop a dying love Don't push on to your own
3359700	3360700	Don't stop a dying love Don't push on to your own
3360700	3384700	Don't stop a dying love Don't push on to your own
3384700	3412700	Don't stop a dying love Don't push on to your own
3412700	3440700	Don't stop a dying love Don't push on to your own
3440700	3468700	Don't stop a dying love Don't push on to your own
3468700	3480700	Don't stop a dying love Don't stop a dying love
