402700	407060	But it was funny because never takes too long because I was like we were talking about the funny jokes
407060	413500	I was like like when I said piss a sippy and then he was I think I said like piss a sippy and he said
413500	418660	Yeah, that was funny when I made that joke and I was like Zach. I made that joke
419820	421820	Like I spelled out
422260	428960	Pissississippi and then you said piss a sippy and I'm like I was like we have to roll back the tape
430060	432620	Almost immediately. She was like, let's go to the tape
433220	438380	Which we didn't but because I thought Eleanor made that I thought it was Eleanor too
438660	445620	She said yeah, she started that she started the joke train talking about pissing in the Mississippi. I just made the word
447140	452420	This is the thing my my role is to serve and then you guys smash
456020	461760	Just like in high school just like in high school you serve somebody else smashes
462860	465140	Volleyball through fifth grade, so I'm really familiar with
473060	475060	Similar to your dick
477820	479820	Sorry, I
480340	481960	Eleanor thank you for apologizing
481960	487720	Well, I hate having this delay because it literally is me saying like similar to your dick and then one two three
488560	494880	And I'm like kill me which is funny cuz now it's gonna be a delay of us making the joke of the delay laughs
496040	500560	Exactly. That's exactly what I do and I want to right now, but it's fine. Oh
502000	504000	We really enjoy this too. Yes

513160	521440	Well, that's great though, I think I think you guys I'm curious to hear more about how you how you talk in bed, but
523520	529880	Real question though, but now I forgot about it. Nevermind. All right, we're now out of combat order. Oh my god
529960	531560	Let's start
531560	538720	With a quick recap of where we ended maybe just some like nice shots. I'm not gonna lie
538720	544520	I thought I just solved all the problems. Yeah, like like I thought the game is over like I fixed it
544520	549720	Well, you do have a point that you have to take the Bigfoot corpse to also
549720	553960	I wouldn't leave a boy's corpse or a Bigfoot foot or
554960	561920	Technically two civilians who know that the unnatural exists. Oh, it's just cleanup. It's cleanup. This episode is cleanup
561920	564160	Oh, that'll be so fun for everyone to listen to no
564160	570520	No, but like I think I think what was a really cool thing that that happened because Chuck like dr. Miller
570520	575960	She was fumbling like crazy, but then Chuck steps in Chuck like the most underrated character
579800	582120	Everyone thinks he's a fucking dumbass, right?
583960	585960	Hey
586000	588800	I've gotten like attack emails to me
590160	592160	associated with this monster, but
592800	599160	He stepped up and freaking saved a day and I feel like we have to play that out because dr
599160	604820	Miller, you know, she thought he was like a buffoon. Maybe I'll get a real purple heart now. Yeah
604820	608720	What do you think from who the government giving you shit?
609200	613680	The president it would be so funny if he's like this wasn't hard at all
613960	619740	You know like this this this is your job that you needed an education for, you know, and she's just like, yeah
619740	621740	He just like goes to medical school
625000	627000	Dr. Cheese, okay
629920	637600	Yeah, could I get like an honorary diploma or something to be a doctor they do that that's who are you asking the government
638360	645480	The people with the money, dr. Miller is gonna seriously, dr. Miller is gonna step up and and kneel next to him and
646400	652480	Put a hand on his shoulder to be like that was absolutely amazing Chuck or I shall call you Charles
652480	658560	Yeah, I turned completely red and have a big smile on my face. Are you jealous during look at this attention?
658560	660560	I'm getting from this other woman
661640	663840	He's not a love interest of mine
663840	668360	Yeah, but someone else is scratching behind my whippet ears and I'm liking it don't you
668840	674880	Wait, when you said that the only thing that mattered to you is your whippet. I just assumed that that relationship was
679960	681960	Yeah, it's a whippet
685320	687320	We went there, huh
688680	690680	Play with small town folk
690680	692680	You
693020	696120	Don't do that in Sweden, I don't I don't
700200	705400	It's not a bestiality what's darker than BC we have to do something
707760	709760	Okay, so you're having this moment with
710560	714920	Charles now you've called him. Yeah, but I think also but then I on the target, right?
714920	719060	So she's like we need to clean this up though, and we need to figure out what the hell is going on in there in
719060	724020	The cabin. Hey Doreen. Are you going to be okay here? Yeah, do you need anything? Do you need anything like
725820	729220	But I think I'm gonna I think I'm gonna pull through water medicine
730220	733940	Would be important. I connect my phone to the Bluetooth and play
734700	736780	tick by big homie G
739820	741820	Just cuz I think she might be bored
742440	748180	Poor Dory might be a little bored. It starts playing through the dope surround sound system in the Sprinter van
748540	754880	That's very important for a lab Doreen starts like kind of like dance in just a little bit. Yes as dr
754880	761580	Miller is getting you some some pain medication. Yeah. Oh morphine. Yeah. Hell yeah, right. You feel good
763980	768780	Zack is very familiar with morphine which also makes me a little nervous for the Zack
769780	773080	Yeah, I I like morphine
773080	775080	More
775720	779400	He was very he was very like oh, oh, yeah, you feel great
779400	785840	I'm never okay. You almost piss your pants as the warmth of a taff million thousand tiny angels
785840	792040	Just like rushes through your bloodstream and you feel better than you've ever felt about anything in your entire life
792040	794960	And I just like giggle a little bit. Yeah
795680	799480	You're not sure whether you just pissed your pants, but you don't I don't care
800480	806800	You're like little angel stop tickling me that's what she says I had surgery one time where I had to have morphine
806800	808800	Oh, I'm not like an addict
811280	814840	I fell through a plate glass window and almost died. It's no big deal. Jeez
816080	821640	Yeah, I was there I had to call his parents to let them know they were four hours away and I was literally I lost
821640	827380	a third of my blood before I made it on the operating table in which they then as they pulled out the 18 inch long piece
827380	829380	Of glass that was stuck in my butt
829460	833020	They hit another artery and I had to have a second blood transfusion
833020	838500	Doctor told me I might not be able to ever walk again, but look at me now motherfuckers not walking not walking
843620	849380	Yeah, that was like less than a year into our relationship and I had to help him pee into a bedpan
850620	856220	So anyway, I knew that we it was real love. Yeah, it's either that or traveling together
856260	864100	It's those two things like uh-huh. Yep bedpans and travel. Yes taking up dump or travel
865000	869620	Yeah, I didn't I didn't help him take a dump. I pressed the nurse button for that
869620	873620	Yeah, the nurse got to wipe me and I just remember I was so hopped up on drugs
873620	875620	but I just kept looking at the nurse and being like
876060	878060	Your job is so weird
879860	881860	She's like I know
882300	887500	Yeah, they don't pay nurses enough Allie inside of this cabin, dr
887500	891340	Rusty Hooch and Jerome Dyer finishing up wiping all
892060	893460	traces
893460	896900	electronic or physical of both the corpse and
897460	903540	The corpse so my last move I like opened up the door to look outside, right?
903540	910780	Can I see like commotion going on out there? Yeah, you you can you can see the light coming out shining down onto the
911660	916340	Freshly powdered ground behind the sprinter van as snow is falling
916380	921040	I mean for a second you thought you heard it's the most wonderful time of the year
921340	924180	but then it leans pretty hard into a
924940	926420	file and
926420	927740	rap
927740	929740	music, okay
929900	933260	So at this point cameras are wiped. I
934140	936140	Know there's not much I can do
936140	938140	I
940980	946980	Was just trying to make the situation realistic that's what you've always been doing
948820	954660	Sorry go ahead, okay cameras are wiped but someone needs to do something about the civilians
954780	959300	So I decide I'm gonna go out to the van and try to switch places with Chuck
959660	965740	Because he needs to take care of these bitches Oh agent dire you watch those two. I run out to the van
965740	970420	He literally motions as you run out. He just motions to a sleeping Carl
973060	976420	Like shrugs at the camera like fucking Jim Halpert
978580	986460	Jack Jack I hop out and then I like give a rice smile and I say notice anything different about what?
986460	989320	I noticed that you looked way uglier than last time I saw you
989920	991920	Damn dude, I
992360	996280	Take it in stride and I say girl. I know this is just your
997040	999440	Insecurity is trying to come out for a boy
1000240	1002840	Cuz you know that you want this duck
1006600	1012360	Admit it I turn around and I just like hock a loogie onto the ground because that's the most disgusting thing
1012360	1017140	I've ever slowly melts into the snow who to know you're softening towards me
1019360	1025680	And then I do like I do the thing we're like you squeeze one peck at a time and they kind of bounce oh
1026480	1028480	I become straight
1033840	1036400	Zero percent in straightness. Sorry
1039240	1042200	Chuck I don't know what the fuck is going on, but we've got two civilians inside
1042200	1044680	I've destroyed all the evidence but we've got to get rid of them
1044680	1048120	Can I can you go inside and take care of that and while while I'm talking to her?
1048120	1051080	I'm looking over and noticing that Doreen is missing a foot
1052480	1054480	And I pull a foot out of my
1056640	1062720	What no, I don't think I roll pull foot out of trench coat, nope, sorry have a zero percent and pull for
1064800	1066800	Oh y'all need a foot
1067240	1072880	Dr. Miller would like to go back into the cabin as well if Doreen is stable enough during how do you feel?
1072880	1077840	I think I can hop because I feel so good from the morphine. I think hopping is gonna be very doable
1078120	1084960	I can hop. All right, I figured it out girl. I put the foot in the deep freeze
1085840	1090440	Do not touch it unless you want to use or is it in something? It's loose
1090440	1096400	Okay, cool. You put a loose foot in the deep freeze. Wait, I didn't did did you get in contact with it?
1097100	1099100	Probably. Yeah
1099200	1104240	That bad. Dr. Miller is gonna give dr. Hooch a long meaningful look
1104240	1107240	Did I do that?
1108840	1114880	Chuck stayed stay right where you are sit on the ground. Don't move a fucking muscle is Chuck still in their hazmat suit
1114880	1119800	He's hazmat suit. Yeah, I think everybody is well, I ripped my shirt off. Oh, that's right
1119800	1124960	You must have ripped the hazmat. So you've got he's shirtless and has the hazmat tied around his waist
1126000	1131040	Great, so he's got the pants of the hazmat. I have the head part on how it's
1131520	1138920	Detaches, but let it be known when he grabbed the foot and put it in the deep freeze. He had his hazmat suit
1138920	1142120	Oh, he was wearing gloves. Yeah, we always forget about the hazmat suit
1143760	1148440	And the hazmat suit. Okay, if you didn't touch it with your bare skin, I'm not worried about it
1148440	1154420	Okay, it's in the deep freeze if we try to kill it that little alien bugs gonna come out again
1154640	1159240	So I say we just leave it there forever. I think I've got a fucking get rid of this deep freeze
1159480	1161480	Isn't there isn't there a delta green
1162160	1169080	Situation here where we can call upon them or something that to extract you literally have a point like a GPS
1169360	1175080	Location in each of your phones for a drop-off warehouse where you're going to bring this body
1175080	1178480	It would be also a great place to bring a foot. Yeah. Yes
1178480	1180480	It might also be a good place to bring
1180480	1185640	The civilians you think if you don't want to have to deal with that aspect of it
1185960	1192040	Although they might get angry at you at the warehouse if you haven't cleaned up everything before you get there. Yeah
1192040	1197840	Well, I think dr. Miller is gonna I think she's gonna suggest that that's exactly what they do of like cleaning up everything
1197920	1199920	trying to get the body into a
1200560	1207880	Secure sort of body bag and then she's gonna try to talk to Carl and Ruth as they wake up
1208720	1210720	Listen, you've been through a lot
1210800	1214360	We understand that this must be extremely traumatic. There are help
1214400	1217280	I mean and she's gonna lie because she doesn't know if there's help
1218000	1222400	She's got there's help for you waiting and we're gonna be taking care of you
1222720	1228720	I suggest that you don't tell anyone what you've seen here and what you've done here
1228840	1236120	But before you talk to your legal counsel, and she knows that there's probably nothing waiting for these people. She's lying
1237000	1239000	Because that's her job
1240000	1240760	Yeah, no
1240760	1242000	I think I think
1242000	1248400	Honestly, I'm not gonna have you roll cuz with everything that's happened so far and Jerome is is there and he's known these people for
1248400	1250400	Three years they trust him
1250880	1254840	They don't know what the fuck is going on. So they're very confused
1255640	1260460	We could have a quick montage of the cleanup of the site
1260560	1268600	You grab a body bag from the sprinter van kind of fold the tarp over the pool table over this boy's corpse
1268720	1272960	And gently lift it with all of its blood and everything dripping
1273400	1278880	Into this body bag and you can kind of get it in there seal it up and you can take that out
1279160	1283120	And get it on the stretcher in the back of this this sprinter van
1283120	1288540	I feel like typically there's a song that plays during a montage and I just want for the for the listeners out there to
1288720	1291200	Kind of have something in mind. Yeah, what do you think?
1291200	1294960	It is the only song that's popping up in my head right now is the what I want you
1299320	1302080	The candle the candle
1303760	1307680	I think yeah, it feels appropriate. Yeah
1309440	1313120	As we as we package away the dead child exactly
1314680	1321080	Dreams come true plays. Well, it's how it's how Doreen marine feels about Chuck now
1322480	1325120	it's actually only playing in her head the rest of us are like
1329080	1336000	When it's a montage from her perspective, it's that song playing and for everyone else it's like a fucking funeral dirge
1341000	1346520	Marina's just like smiling so big the whole time. Everybody's just so distraught and she's just like
1348460	1351640	Bopping to an invisible tune invisible. Yeah
1351640	1353400	Okay
1353400	1360280	Okay, so I can have Jerome I'm Jerome fuck it's been a long day
1360280	1367320	I can have Carl and in Janus if you guys want to ride with me and then I'll follow you
1367320	1370120	You said there's a place that we can go. Do you have a
1370640	1373840	Day of location. How about I ride with you Jerome? And then
1374400	1377320	Yes, we have the coordinates Chuck will drive the other car
1377320	1382620	I got it. Doreen is like so happy and she knows she drove on the way here and still has her right foot
1383760	1385360	Was it my right foot?
1385360	1392240	It was your left foot. Of course if you drive with your right foot. Yeah. Yeah, and so I like try to fight Chuck on driving
1393080	1394760	Come on
1394760	1396760	Well, that wouldn't be my voice
1396760	1398760	I
1404160	1409400	Messed with this hair. I immediately can see didn't say, okay
1414120	1419880	Amazing like I said, I'm going in the other car like tight tight tight. You got this. I trust you
1420240	1422240	Rusty who'd you letting this happen? I?
1423840	1425200	Damn
1425200	1427200	Yeah, I'm gonna let you drive bitch
1429280	1431280	Cuz I got him I gotta watch the foot
1433960	1435960	Guys pack up
1436040	1440740	Everything any evidence you've cleaned up. I need whoever who has the highest forensics
1441560	1443560	20 40
1443560	1445560	50 okay, so
1445680	1452680	You're gonna let the girl and morphine do our forensic check. You would actually have a negative 20 on this much morphine
1452680	1457740	So it's 30. So who had the 40? Okay. So yeah, and that makes sense. She's been cleaning up
1457740	1466060	Anyway, that was like her whole situation inside this this this little cabin shack thing lean to a huge lean to with the toilet
1467080	1470200	Can you can you roll forensics for me?
1471960	1473960	Just to make sure you don't miss anything
1473960	1475760	And
1475760	1483440	Do you want I am 91 you nailed it you wait what you are positive that you cleaned it this side up perfectly
1483440	1487480	And so you guys are going to head on out
1490680	1492560	It's a lovely
1492560	1494440	lovely January night
1494440	1499680	wind is whipping up the snow into a bit of a frenzy and
1500080	1506400	It is just biting your noses as you pack up everything into the sprinter van and
1507440	1512880	into one of the trucks that is on this site Jerome's truck is here and
1513720	1515720	They're gonna hop into that one. You see a
1516360	1519600	Older and like lifted and souped up
1519600	1525800	It says bush on the side of it with a bullet hole for the period after each letter
1526080	1528080	You're pretty sure that one's Carl's
1528080	1535180	Yeah, Jerome's just got a nice like f-250 or something like that with four doors. So it's got the extended
1535180	1539580	I don't know why I'm getting so into these fucking trucks. It doesn't matter you get into the trucks
1540440	1543080	You get into the truck. Dr. Miller with
1543500	1550600	Jerome driving and you've got Carl and Janice in the backseat kind of smushed together in the backseat and
1551440	1552360	And
1552360	1557280	We're gonna leave this fucking horrible mess of a site
1558120	1560200	Yeah, it's just memes guys. So
1561920	1566520	You drive down the long gravel driveway to get out
1566880	1573860	Jerome hits a like a garage door opener that opens the gate for the sprinter van that's in the lead and
1574280	1578420	Doreen puts her one good foot to the pedal
1581120	1586280	And turns onto the road following the GPS coordinates
1586800	1590320	which is much easier now that Jerome Dyer has
1590840	1596980	Kind of released the cellular grip that he had on this area. And so you all have full bars again
1597720	1600480	obviously, dr. Hooch's phone starts blowing up and
1601480	1606240	Doreen is driving. Is anyone sitting shotgun or the two of you just in the back?
1606400	1610360	I'm in the back next to the fridge. I'm next to Doreen just cuz I
1610800	1613800	I'm never gonna say no to her but I do think it's smart to
1614560	1617560	Check out the road as we go. I think that's really smart
1619520	1624280	Yes, and so everything seems to be going smoothly
1625760	1631000	Doreen and the Chuckster are getting along like fucking gangbusters
1631000	1636920	Like y'all are just like especially in Doreen's loosened lucid lucidity
1637720	1643880	especially after the release of all of these endorphins that you've just had Doreen it sort of seems like this is a
1644440	1648920	Party and then I pull out a beer and I'm like, I'm catching up and then I crack it
1650480	1654400	Cuz I want to be on her level while you're monitoring her driving, that's right
1654400	1659320	I just remember that she has refrigerated pants and I have unrefrigerated
1659520	1664120	Mentos in my pockets and I think about how much I like those nice cold Mentos and I asked I
1665000	1670140	Asked Chuck if he will store my loose Mentos in his refrigerated pockets, please
1670360	1674400	Yeah, we could do that, but it could probably get a lot pulled a lot faster in the deep freeze
1677840	1682580	Just a thought Maureen may feel really nice good, but she's not
1683240	1684880	at that
1684880	1688040	Sentence the camera pans back through to see dr
1688040	1694360	Rusty hooch just like staring at this deep freeze and we see this body bag is sitting on the stretcher
1694640	1702840	Okay, I'm in the back. I'm here Doreen and Chuck being idiots up in the front drinking on the way to the drop-off. I
1703480	1709640	Immediately realized that I don't trust them. I don't trust that they inspected this foot. So I open up the freezer
1709640	1719400	The camera pans into the freezer and out through the back of the sprinter van
1720120	1724840	onto the windshield of the truck driving behind and we see Jerome Dyer and
1725800	1729240	Dr. Miller having a conversation in the front
1730240	1736760	Though it is silent for some time. I would assume in this truck before Jerome's finally like
1737760	1742320	That was weird it always tend to be I'd almost forgotten
1745200	1748840	It's kind of it's been a nice break, right
1749880	1751480	Where are you from?
1751480	1757880	Fort Worth, how did you get in with these people? Like, you know better. I believed Carl
1758760	1766960	The camera you Jerome reaches for the rearview mirror and adjusts it to see Carl with his head like slung back
1775600	1779520	Still just knocked out cold because Ali hasn't snapped your fingers yet
1779520	1781520	I
1785080	1792120	Just trusted him I believed his story and I knew that they were onto something and I knew that I needed to be here
1793400	1795400	for when it happened and
1795960	1802400	Janice is in the backseat. Just like fuck. Are you guys talking about nothing, honey? Nothing you have to worry about
1803520	1805520	Here have one of these and she picks out
1806200	1811160	Some sort of pill that will make her probably at least try to cool her nerves
1811480	1819000	Not as strong as the whatever potion that pooch made but something that to just have her not listening on us and calm down
1819200	1821200	Okay, so after a bit longer
1821720	1823520	silence in the car
1823520	1827360	You look back Janice is like over with her head on
1828040	1829640	Carl's shoulder
1829640	1833360	Janice Ruth with the most like deviated septum of all time
1835680	1839920	And Carl Lambert's king of the loogie
1845640	1850320	Dr. Miller is gonna continue to talk to Jerome. I mean you weren't that far off
1850840	1855440	It's just that it never is, you know, it's never it's never religion behind it
1855440	1861180	It's never you know, one of these stories. It's just stories that people come up with to explain whatever it is, but
1861920	1863920	The truth is always darker. I found
1865760	1871960	Yeah, I suppose you wouldn't believe that one day you find out or hear about like a man big fat man
1871960	1877680	We're dressed in red. You wouldn't assume that it's Santa. It's always, you know some alien or some
1878200	1882760	Disgusting pedophile or whatever. I know. Okay, maybe not that but are we saying that Santa's
1885760	1887760	She's gonna be like
1888320	1890320	It's always worse
1890320	1892320	Oh
1893480	1898120	Just looks at you with a confused look and we are gonna have a
1898600	1903120	Drive check from Doreen marine. Oh at a negative 20
1904400	1906600	For being hopped up on morphine
1914040	1917340	92 wait. Yeah 92. Yeah 92
1920320	1922320	Oh
1922360	1924360	No
1926560	1931540	Fucking pigs. Hey, it's good. You're an actual. Okay, wait
1933200	1938960	It's cool. It's cool. It's cool Doreen. Do you have your FBI agent?
1941000	1948320	Doreen puts her hand in the back pocket where she usually keeps her firearms and pulls out her wallet and it's filled with loosement
1948320	1950320	And identification
1954880	1961080	She grabs a loose mentos and sticks them in Chuck's pocket or in my mouth to make me not talk
1963920	1967760	Dr. Miller you and Jerome Dyer see this as well and
1968360	1971760	This cop car is about to make a move
1972200	1976640	You're on a two-lane country road again these trees
1977040	1982500	Connecting over the top build the canopy to the moonlight to just kind of like
1982720	1985600	Hit you every once in a while as you're driving just like
1987600	1993320	Almost like the lights was you're driving through a tunnel, but it's the moonlight through this tunnel of trees. Oh
1993920	1995920	Oh
2001520	2005220	You you are the first to notice and this cop is about to
2005560	2010760	Pass you on this two-lane road to get in between you and the and the sprinter man
2011760	2015760	Shit shit shit shit shit shit. Play it cool. Play it cool
2016120	2022720	We have we have our papers in order, you know the protocol so as Jerome begins to kind of
2023320	2028480	slow down and pull over onto the side of the road the cop car just continues on past and
2029000	2033960	Is right behind the sprinter van with its lights on siren going?
2034560	2038480	Doreen pulls over we're good. We're ready Chuck. Shut the fuck up
2038480	2045360	Don't say a fucking word as you pull over you see the truck just fucking fly by you as Jerome Dyer continues past
2045640	2051800	Hey, hey Jerome, what the fuck? Well, you said be cool. I know he wasn't pulling me over. Should I pull over now?
2051800	2057960	Yeah, okay. Okay. Sorry. Sorry shit. The mission is back there. Like do you think those three dumbass is gonna be able to
2058680	2065480	So as you're saying that he's like and he pulls over so now the sprinter van is like shining its lights
2066440	2071880	You see the truck that Jerome Dyer's driving pulled over in the distance ahead of you
2072340	2074340	Cop is behind you lights on
2074520	2079000	Sprinter vans pulled over cop gets out of the car as he walks up
2079680	2081680	Around the back of the sprinter van
2082000	2090100	he gives it a weird like hand tap on the back like they always do it's like they'd have to touch your car as they
2090100	2092100	approach it and
2092640	2099400	He knocks on the window Dorian rolls down the window and she says howdy officer, how's it going tonight on his chest?
2099400	2101400	It says officer
2101720	2103400	McGovern

2120160	2122160	man from King of the Hill

2133880	2136060	Let's dive into Steven government. He is like
2137600	2139600	licensing registration
2139640	2147600	Doreen pulls out her wallet and shows license registration along with her her federal identification and card. Hmm
2150320	2152320	I'll be right back
2152640	2157920	And he goes back and sits in the cop car through my mouth of Mentos
2158080	2159080	I go
2159080	2164240	And then I give her a high-five y'all we need a plan B. I don't I don't feel right about this
2164240	2169200	I think we need to play it cool for now, but I I'm also feeling a little a little shaky about it
2169200	2173920	All right, he opens this back door. I can't promise I won't shoot him in the face. I think that's fair
2173920	2177440	I think it's fair to I don't know. I don't see another way out of here
2178080	2179680	after a while
2179680	2181840	You notice a second
2182640	2184640	Cop car pulls up behind his
2184760	2186120	Fuck
2186120	2189080	I'm actually getting a little anxious. He gets out of the car as
2190120	2191760	does the
2191760	2198700	Backup and they talk for a second the guy who is in backup mode goes and gets back in his car
2199960	2201760	Car stays put
2201760	2208800	Officer McGovern comes back up to the window. He hands you back your identification. You know anything about
2210680	2213560	Shotgun being fired woods
2214680	2220640	No, sorry officer. I don't I don't know anything about that. He shines a light in your eyes
2221360	2229680	Ma'am, I I know that you're a federal agent. But are you under the influence right now? I don't believe I understand your question, sir. I
2231720	2233720	Need you to roll law
2236600	2239620	She's also bleeding from a leg
2239620	2243660	Yeah, he can't see that yet
2252020	2254020	Lindsay have you passed a single role?
2258140	2265820	That's a 51 on a 30 51 on a 30 is not gonna do it ma'am. Will you step out car real quick?
2265820	2267820	Dorian
2269580	2276100	Turns and gives a shoots a quick look at rusty huge and
2280140	2282420	Slowly with a big smile
2285200	2288740	Opens the door and swings out
2288740	2290740	That
2291740	2293740	T-shirt tied nub
2294340	2296340	And hops down
2296900	2298380	to the ground
2298380	2305860	Jesus Christ, what the fuck happened? Did you shoot your foot off? What kind of a stupid-ass question is that?
2305860	2307860	No, I did not shoot
2308260	2312780	Here, I'm here looking for people who may have been oh
2312780	2316960	I don't know firing shotguns in the woods and here you are
2317600	2324320	Missing a foot I got attacked by a bear in the woods if you need to really know you're rusty
2324320	2326320	You want to make us a potion?
2326560	2333280	Okay, can I climb over the middle console and jump in the driver's seat and grab dr. Miller?
2333280	2339480	You are like turned around looking at this situation and you see dr.
2339480	2341480	Hooch like climbing over
2341480	2343480	The
2343600	2347320	Chuckster in the front seat after Doreen has gotten out
2347880	2352400	Would I realize that they're planning on killing the cops? I have no idea
2353400	2356100	I wouldn't have thought they were gonna kill the cop. I don't know
2357400	2364480	No, I'm not saying I'm I'm not saying I'm killing the cop. I jump in the driver's seat and grab Doreen and drive away
2364880	2366880	Yeah, she's trying
2367720	2370320	So we're escaping the cops instead
2371800	2375920	I don't know if I'm strong enough to do that, but I feel like I could that fucking rules
2376520	2379120	Let's find out what happens with dice rolling
2380960	2387040	You you dr. Hooch, yeah as you climb into the driver's seat of the sprinter van
2387400	2389680	Also, I've forgotten to close the freezer door
2393600	2395600	My anxiety
2395600	2401020	I was in a panic clearly. I need either I think athletics
2401480	2403160	or
2403160	2405160	strength in order to
2406320	2414360	Grab and hold on to Doreen as you want to like punch it out of here. Okay, I'll roll on athletics or on strength
2415360	2420920	Being the person that she's grabbing. Can I also roll to see how I don't know Lindsey. You're a your track record
2421580	2425400	Okay, you're gonna roll alertness of a negative 20 for being on morphine
2425400	2430800	But if you know if you can sense what's happening, then you're gonna give her a plus 20 nice
2432480	2434480	Thing he's crossed
2435880	2439160	God damn it. She rolled a fucking 97. I
2440040	2446120	Hate these die. So I'm just rolling on my you're just rolling on athletics or strength. Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna roll on string
2447600	2450720	Three on a 50 that's good you grab
2451200	2456800	Doreen marine and you pull her up to where she can at least get one foot on that like step
2456840	2460160	Part to get up into the sprinter van. Is it her foot or nub? Oh
2461080	2464760	It would be my foot because it's my right foot is the one I still have nice
2465040	2472220	Your foot plants on to that as she grabs on to you and you fucking punch it immediately that backup cop just
2473440	2477240	Sirens blaring again and you see officer Steve McGovern
2477720	2480880	sprints back to get into his police car and
2481600	2488760	The game is now afoot. Once again, Jerome Dyer is in the car with dr. Olivia Miller and he's like, what do I do?
2488760	2493520	What do I do? What do I do? We have to I guess we're driving we have now
2495000	2498600	Unbelievable drive just drive. All right, or actually
2499880	2504680	We could block them. We could block the cops give the other team a chance
2504680	2510800	I love that and the sprinter van drives past you on the road and Jerome just like
2511320	2512360	Sploosh
2512360	2517400	Slams on the gas the wheels start turning on this truck as the back end just whips around
2517800	2520120	grabs hold of the ditch and just
2521080	2528440	Kind of flings itself up onto right in the middle of this two-lane country road as the cops begin to drive up
2528800	2534400	he rolled a 26 on his drive against fail on the cop the cop just
2534800	2538700	Cannot get through on in time and literally just stops in the road
2538780	2541540	You are looking past Jerome Dyer and
2542340	2549320	Through the driver's side window. You can see this cop. It's headlights shining directly in on this truck
2549320	2554280	You have two asleep people in the back and his sirens are going and the other cop is
2554540	2559780	Driving down into the ditch to get around you. Dr. Miller. What do I do? What do I do? Fuck?

2592160	2593280	Reverse for sorry
2593280	2598960	I'm not used to a stick shift leaning out the side of the window as he just continues to block one
2598960	2603760	And then the other one starts to go and he blocks that one and then he goes back the other way and he's like, sorry
2604120	2606120	Sorry. Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry
2606680	2608680	Perfect. It's perfect

2626520	2633760	With a critical success, I'm not gonna have them get like super angry or like too upset there they buy the whole
2636680	2638680	They're like honest mistake
2639280	2645480	Well, honestly Jerome Jerome Dyer looks like a nerd and these two Arkansas cops are just like wow
2645880	2649560	This fucking idiot cannot drive this truck
2649800	2656960	He honestly doesn't even deserve to be driving that f-250 that thing is a nice machine and I just don't understand how

2695040	2701120	Off of the driver dr. Hooch and dr. Hooch as you're driving on these long winding country roads
2701480	2707600	You're gonna need to make a drive check to get away clean if you can pass a drive
2708000	2713120	I'm gonna say at a plus 20 because of the extreme effort of
2713720	2716960	Jerome Dyer and dr. Miller if you can pass
2717600	2722520	This then you will get away Scott free shit. All right, I'm rolling on a 40

2826000	2828000	white Christmas
2832640	2837600	Over the radio not yet. So you guys are driving to your drop-off point
2837960	2841040	It's like I gave it such a nice little bowtie at the end
2843440	2846920	You're right the sprinter van and the truck with
2847960	2851800	Jerome and dr. Miller Carl Lambert and Janice Ruth
2852800	2854400	both arrive
2854400	2859360	down in this warehouse district in a small town in Arkansas as
2860320	2866440	a huge warehouse door and the pin that is dropped on each of your clean phones
2867280	2869740	with cases on them
2870460	2874520	Allie I actually saw dr. Hooch take hers off and throw it out the window
2880140	2882540	You guys arrive at roughly the same time and
2883300	2887260	The pin is inside this one specific warehouse
2887860	2895200	It's got a normal door next to one of those like enormous like corrugated metal doors that can open up for like
2895340	2898560	You know a sprinter van to drive through it or something like that
2899480	2901360	When you guys arrive
2901360	2902480	the
2902480	2908520	Large door begins to roll up and inside you just see like bright lights
2909160	2913800	Shining out so that you can't really see into the darkness inside this warehouse
2914480	2916360	Sprinter van drives in
2916360	2918360	red truck drives in
2919160	2920760	As
2920760	2926680	The doors close you see a single police car pulling up
2928560	2933460	There are two men in this warehouse that is
2934040	2937920	Blocked off to where you can't really see what's going on in the back of the warehouse
2937920	2939920	There's some makeshift walls up front
2940280	2947760	Just kind of like dividers and they're the only two people on this side of the dividers. One of them's like ah
2948560	2952980	Man, Jim, we got cops. You wanna go take care of it
2953180	2955180	Oh
2955380	2961620	Okay, yeah, yeah for sure should I go what do you think Santa Claus or Easter Bunny
2967500	2973260	Guy comes back out like two minutes later as you know, the first guy with the high voice he comes around
2973680	2977820	He's talking to you guys. She's like, okay, what's the deal? Give me the rundown?
2978460	2983180	You start talking telling stories like you're trying to be pretty vague
2983180	2986860	But you have to let him know about this fucking foot inside the freezer
2986860	2992260	And as you're about to start describing like the actual gritty details of it
2992260	2996020	the other guy comes out literally in full Santa regalia and
2997020	3000620	he's putting a silencer on the end of a pistol and
3001420	3003420	He looks at you guys and he's like
3004420	3006420	If anybody sees and they tell
3007100	3009700	What are they gonna fucking believe Santa's out killing cops?
3010260	3014580	So he heads out the front door with the gun behind his back
3015100	3018380	Maybe if he's an alien pedophile Santa
3019500	3021500	Colbeck
3023940	3026140	Okay, so we're gonna want to get everything
3027580	3032900	There's a lot of you is this one team or two teams what's going on here? We're one big happy team
3033420	3036460	Ain't that right? What about the sleeping couple?
3037140	3041580	What's their deal? Those are civilians civilians that were on the scene
3041620	3047060	you will need to take care of them to she glances at the silencer and she's like
3047660	3053620	The perhaps not that way but yeah, I was gonna say did it do they have any evidence?
3054300	3060860	No, are they like trusted in society is like people with like they have a YouTube following what kind?
3061300	3068260	Probably like 200 people max. I don't know. Yeah, it's like I think I wrote down. It's a hundred and seventy-nine loyal followers
3069180	3073380	Well, it's like they say the first hundred followers is toughest one
3075580	3078060	But she's like I'm sure that
3078820	3086320	I'm sure that they can be convinced that you know something went down here, but they don't have any evidence and as far as I know
3087160	3093560	Yeah, if they don't if they don't know where this is and they don't have any evidence no one's gonna believe them
3093560	3095560	You said it was a fucking
3095600	3100400	Bigfoot that turned into a boy corpse. So they're gonna be fine. They're gonna go back out in the world
3100400	3104320	I'll tell you exactly what's gonna happen. They're gonna go back out in the world. They're gonna keep making their YouTube thing
3104320	3111000	they're gonna be like this guy who helped us was in on the government conspiracy and then anyone who knows anything is gonna be like
3111000	3113000	I
3113240	3118720	Was a really good heart sound I think and when she looks at the sleeping Carl
3119480	3121480	It seems to be his brother
3121780	3124480	Actually, we could also make an argument that
3125260	3127260	He killed his own brother
3128200	3134000	That's cold. Wow, that's a huge age difference between these siblings, right?
3135480	3139700	Actually, yes, let's not play that one then because his brother disappeared a long time ago
3140260	3146900	Damn oh shit. I bet he's done. He opens up the warehouse door and Santa Claus drives the cop car
3150140	3153580	All right, well I've got a clean car for you guys and
3155420	3158380	Make sure to tell Santa what you want for Christmas on your way out

3171820	3174860	Gets into one of the cars and he talks to Jerome
3174860	3181820	He's like, could you drop me off and then she says like a nondescript station where she can get out get on like a train
3181820	3187060	Or bus or something does not give her Facebook name to these people

3657320	3665200	Carl Lambert and Janice Ruth were dropped off back at Bush HQ where their trucks were parked when they went inside
3666160	3671420	Carl found a thumb drive in the pocket of a jacket. He had worn sometime before
3672440	3675000	Dr. Ann Falsom arrived
3676680	3678680	Oh
3678840	3685320	Officer Steve McGovern was reported missing sometime near the end of that shift
3686080	3690600	His GPS location was tracked to the warehouse district
3692160	3694160	Inside an empty warehouse
3694800	3700200	Sat an elegantly wrapped present in red and green gold
3700680	3707840	And after a special unit opened the gift they received just about the worst thing
3708280	3710160	could ever get a
3710160	3712160	lack of closure
3724560	3725480	However
3725480	3727360	earlier in his shift
3727360	3734400	Officer McGovern called for backup and then failed to get into a high-speed pursuit and
3735080	3739880	After he called in the plates of this fan. He had tried to pull over
3740440	3747840	He called back to get it on the record that the chase involved a sprinter van
3749040	3753200	driven by an intoxicated FBI agent named
3754280	3756280	Doreen
3757360	3759360	Oh
