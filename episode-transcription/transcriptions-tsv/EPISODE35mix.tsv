0	8000	Hey there y'all, it's your little ol' Wolfie boy again here on 694.2 PTBP
8000	15000	Now I know y'all have been missing me even though my last broadcast was only about a half hour ago
15000	19000	It is currently 11 a.m. on December the 6th
19000	27000	Today on Howlin' with Wolf we got ourselves an announcement from user totorosebangbus over on the subreddit
27000	32000	Who posted about the show and tagged at pretending pod on Instagram
32000	38000	If you want to write a message for Wolf to read on air, follow in their extremely helpful footsteps
38000	41000	Tag us on Instagram or Twitter at pretending pod
41000	48000	Or write us a 5 star review on apple podcast and email us at pretendingpod at gmail.com
48000	50000	Totorosebangbus writes
50000	57000	Hello folks, Patreon here and I just want to say that I don't understand why you keep mentioning me
57000	63000	But I would like to thank you for the influx of money that has come my way recently due to this show
63000	70000	Thanks to you all, I am one step closer to getting my mushroom restaurant shiitake on me up and going in the city
70000	75000	I'd like to offer everyone a 15% coupon off for when we do open
75000	83000	Man, I can't wait to use that 15% off coupon to get me a steaming bowl of some of that dirt fungus
83000	87000	My favorite part of the mushroom is all that nasty mud
87000	90000	I hope they don't wash them off too much
90000	93000	My producer has a note here
93000	98000	Apparently a vast and overwhelming number of wolf pups are android users
99000	107000	This makes it all the more necessary to steal the iPhones from your parents' nightstands, your co-workers' desks, your children's hands
107000	115000	And write a 5 star review for pretending to be people on Tim Cook's bondage fetish machine
115000	121000	Man, I can't stop thinking about all those delicious funky mud babies that I'm gonna get at that mushroom diner
121000	124000	The fungus that dwells as a morel
124000	129000	Give me that mushroom stew, baby, and give it some extra stank
129000	138000	Speaking of blasphemous smells like rot and greed and cirrhosis piss, it's the hemorrhoids of truth, it's the news
138000	148000	John Lee Pettymore or Kevin Lee Pettymore or whatever he's called himself now had a vision and is now convinced he has the second sight
148000	153000	Keith Vigna desperately wanted to call the number left to them by Agent Kennedy
153000	155000	Agent McKinley and Billy Harrison
155000	161000	Oh shit, Kennedy, McKinley, Billy William Harrison?
161000	164000	I definitely get it now
164000	170000	Clark Bishop was called out by a strange humanoid figure that just appeared on top of a nearby crypt
170000	176000	And taking us to that scene now, using the unnatural power to roll back time
176000	180000	It is kudzu with no backbone
183000	186000	And now
201000	205000	You hear this massive noise erupt from behind you
205000	215000	You see standing and materializing all at once on top of this crypt that is overlooking the clearing that you are standing in for the funeral of Ari Manstein
215000	223000	There is this figure, this large, like six and a half foot tall humanoid figure with translucent skin
223000	231000	It's got giant gaunt features wearing a black suit and it looks at Clark Bishop directly in the eyes and says
231000	243000	Hello subject 15225181955018 please give me the book
243000	245000	How scared am I of this thing just by appearance?
245000	248000	Go ahead and first off, everyone roll sanity for me
248000	251000	It's like a man in black kind of thing, like a grey man
252000	254000	Exactly
254000	256000	What are we doing? Sorry?
256000	258000	Everyone roll sanity for me
258000	260000	Oh hell yeah, I got a 53
260000	262000	I fail
262000	264000	I have 14 so I fail
264000	266000	I fail, 34 on a 20
266000	271000	Everyone lose one sanity and did any of you roll over your power?
271000	272000	No
272000	273000	I did
273000	274000	Yeah, I rolled a 90
274000	276000	I've rolled a 53 on a 50
276000	278000	Also I need to borrow a pencil
278000	280000	Yeah, same
280000	282000	Shit
282000	284000	Fuck
284000	288000	Why did you have to get this nice soft desk? I can't write anything on it
288000	292000	This is like a test in Men in Black
296000	299000	There's no proper surface on which to write
299000	301000	What just happened? We lost one sanity?
301000	302000	You each lost one sanity
302000	305000	And you and I both rolled over our power
305000	307000	That is correct, so keep that in mind
307000	309000	Okay, very close
309000	313000	I've got a 19 with a breaking point of 18
313000	315000	Oh boy, and Thomas?
315000	317000	A 21 with a breaking point of 20
317000	319000	Oh boy
319000	320000	Luke, where's Keith at?
320000	323000	I'm at 13 with a breaking point of 8
323000	326000	Alright, we are down to the end
333000	338000	I want it that way
339000	341000	That was tight
341000	345000	For $50 a month on our Patreon you can get the
345000	347000	The acapella
347000	351000	It's the PTBP acapella
351000	354000	Yeah, that's hard to say, Justin has to say it like every week
354000	356000	PTBP, PTBP
356000	361000	Anyway, we recorded a 45 track album
361000	364000	Covering every boy band
364000	367000	Well, we just do a lot of interpretations of Tell Me Why
367000	369000	Tell Me Why
370000	373000	We've got Dixieland, we've got hip-hop
373000	376000	It took us a lot of takes, but we put them all on there
376000	378000	There's the Bread Street Boys
378000	380000	Tell Me Why
380000	382000	Oh my goodness
382000	384000	Oh, we even have parodies
384000	387000	Well, you have to get into parodies when you do that many versions
387000	390000	Okay, so you each lose one sanity
390000	395000	And the figure, the towering gaunt figure
395000	399000	Is just staring at you and it slowly begins to hold out
399000	402000	One of its overtly long hands
402000	405000	Clark is going for his gun, but as he's doing it
405000	407000	He's yelling at the thing
407000	410000	What, what, what book, what are you?
410000	413000	And as I finish that, what are you, my gun is pointed at him
413000	415000	Okie dokie
415000	417000	Kevin John has very little left to live
417000	420000	And he just reaches out a hand
420000	422000	In greeting
422000	424000	You're about 20 yards, 20 feet away
424000	426000	You're gonna try to shake its hand
426000	428000	I mean, it's got a long arm, but I don't know if it's that long
428000	430000	How long is the arm?
430000	433000	I would say the arm itself is 5 feet long
433000	434000	Too long
434000	435000	What is Keith doing?
435000	437000	Keith runs behind a
439000	440000	Anything
440000	442000	What do you call the above ground
442000	443000	A mausoleum?
443000	444000	A mausoleum
444000	447000	I run behind the closest mausoleum, pull my gun out and hide
447000	448000	Alrighty
448000	451000	You hold out your gun pointed at it
451000	454000	I need you to roll power for me
459000	461000	I pass a 50 on a 60
461000	462000	Alright
462000	466000	You feel internal struggle within yourself
466000	470000	But overcome it in your ability to continue pointing this gun
470000	472000	And the creature says
472000	477000	Please, I would not like to ask again
477000	480000	Please give me the book
480000	484000	I don't know what book you're talking about, evil thing
486000	491000	It turns its attention to Kevin John Lee Pettymore standing next
491000	492000	And it says
492000	494000	What is your name?
494000	495000	Roll power
497000	499000	Pass, 20 on a 60
499000	503000	You have the ability to do whatever you would like to do here
503000	504000	As it asks you your name
504000	507000	Well I'm Kevin John, that's a long story
507000	509000	What's your name?
509000	514000	43629 and I am here for the book
514000	519000	Well, we don't know what book you want but
519000	524000	I can feel the book is nearby
524000	526000	Clark is looking for Keith
526000	529000	Keith is hiding behind the closest mausoleum
530000	532000	I peek around the corner
532000	534000	Aim my gun at the guy and take a shot
534000	536000	Oh shit
536000	538000	Roll firearms
539000	544000	It's a 32 on a 70
544000	550000	Alrighty, roll a 2d10 for damage as you fire your small powerful pistol at this creature
550000	555000	That is a 4 and a 2, 6
555000	556000	4 and a 2, 6
556000	560000	You fire this gun and you wing it in the arm
560000	564000	And you see as the bullet flies through
564000	570000	This arm just kind of like dissipates and then begins to slowly reform
570000	576000	And before you have even smelled the smoke off of your firearm
576000	581000	This creature is standing next to you with its hand on your throat
581000	583000	And it lifts you up against the mausoleum
583000	586000	And it says, what is your name?
586000	588000	Roll power
589000	591000	That's cocked
593000	594000	59 on a 50
594000	596000	Keeping them honest
596000	599000	You immediately respond with your name
599000	603000	Keith Vigna, what are you doing here?
603000	605000	I was here for the funeral
605000	607000	Why are you shooting?
607000	609000	I'm just scared
609000	614000	It slowly places you back down on the ground and says
614000	616000	Do not be scared
616000	618000	And you are not
618000	620000	Oh dope
620000	622000	This guy's cool
622000	624000	When it was not on the mausoleum and was then at Keith
624000	627000	Did we see it do anything or did it just blink?
627000	633000	It's as if you stood completely still while it moved there in a normal fashion
633000	635000	But it was all sped up
635000	637000	This is likely what you think
637000	639000	The other perspective was
639000	641000	Like what the audience saw
641000	643000	Super duper cool
643000	645000	I am only here for the book
645000	647000	And then I will go
647000	653000	Subject 1522518195518
653000	655000	There will be no trouble
657000	659000	Give him the book man
659000	661000	I don't
661000	663000	John I don't know what book it wants
663000	665000	I don't have a book
665000	667000	I don't have a book
667000	669000	I came here with the clothes on my back and a gun
669000	671000	I don't have a book
671000	673000	I don't have a book
673000	675000	Oh shit I'm not near you sorry
675000	677000	Keith you got a book?
677000	679000	What?
679000	681000	Give him a book
681000	683000	I don't read
683000	685000	I don't have any books
685000	687000	Clark is trying to address the thing
687000	689000	Is it looking at me when I do?
689000	691000	Immediately
691000	693000	We do not possess a book
693000	695000	A book
695000	697000	This creature walks up to you
697000	699000	And begins tilting its head
699000	701000	To the side
701000	703000	Back and forth like a dog
703000	705000	When you say squirrel
705000	707000	And it says
707000	709000	No book
715000	717000	No no book
717000	719000	What you do
719000	721000	It is here you are
721000	723000	Subject
723000	725000	And it's kind of like
725000	727000	Freaking out it's getting really upset
727000	729000	It doesn't understand
729000	731000	Why you don't have this book
731000	733000	And especially why you're not just
733000	735000	Giving it to it
735000	737000	Where are you?
737000	739000	I'm here
739000	741000	I'm at a cemetery in the city
741000	743000	The city cemetery
743000	745000	I am where the book is
745000	747000	You should be here with
747000	749000	The book
749000	751000	I walk over to
751000	753000	Ari's coffin and open it up
753000	755000	And see if there's a book in there
755000	757000	Roll search
757000	759000	84 on a 40
759000	761000	You've merely horrified her
761000	763000	Few remaining relatives
765000	767000	If anyone else is here from their funeral
767000	769000	They are fucked up
769000	771000	There's one old lady who has been sitting there
771000	773000	She can't leave
773000	775000	She's in a wheelchair and she just
775000	777000	On top of all this she sees you open her granddaddy's
777000	779000	She can barely see
779000	781000	And she's completely deaf
781000	783000	She's just like where did everybody go?
785000	787000	Clark is kind of not
787000	789000	He's holding his gun up
789000	791000	To be not threatening now
791000	793000	Can you describe
793000	795000	The book?
795000	797000	What book is it?
797000	799000	The book is necessary
799000	801000	For me to take
801000	803000	Away from you
803000	805000	You are not to be in
805000	807000	Possession of the book
807000	809000	Your time with it
809000	811000	Has come to an end
811000	813000	Now and
813000	815000	We do not want you
815000	817000	Using it any further
819000	821000	I guess good news we don't have it anymore
821000	823000	That is not good news
823000	825000	I need to bring it
825000	827000	What do you mean by
827000	829000	You're where it is but we're not where it is
829000	831000	The book is here
831000	833000	When?
833000	835000	I take another shot at this thing
835000	837000	Damn it
837000	839000	Keith
839000	841000	Roll firearms
841000	843000	10 on a 70
843000	845000	Roll damage 2d10
845000	847000	Oh no
847000	849000	18
849000	851000	2 nines
851000	853000	Ok
853000	855000	As you fire
855000	857000	Through this thing
857000	859000	Oh right
859000	861000	Sorry you mentioned earlier that it went through
861000	863000	Like dissipated so maybe you're not hurting it but anyway
863000	865000	The blasts
865000	867000	Go through its body
867000	869000	And it falls
869000	871000	Never mind
871000	873000	Every single part of its body
873000	875000	Dissipates into smoke as it hits the ground
875000	877000	Including its suit
877000	879000	And it is no longer
879000	881000	Standing or existing
881000	883000	In front of you I need all three of you
883000	885000	To roll sanity
885000	887000	58
887000	889000	Fail
889000	891000	Oh I pass
891000	893000	A fucking 14 on a 19
893000	895000	Congratulations
895000	897000	98 on a 13
897000	899000	Is that over your power?
899000	901000	You each lose one sanity
901000	903000	And Luke I need you to dive deep
903000	905000	Ok so that's my breaking point
905000	907000	The next time that you
907000	909000	Go unconscious you will wake up
909000	911000	With a new
911000	913000	Disorder
913000	915000	I run over to Clark
915000	917000	And I tackle him
917000	919000	And I want to pin him down
919000	921000	And ask him
921000	923000	What fucking book was he talking about?
923000	925000	Alright I need you both to roll
925000	927000	Unarmed combat
927000	929000	Just to see who
929000	931000	See what happens here
931000	933000	Keith
933000	935000	You're fucking fucked
935000	937000	I rolled a 40
937000	939000	On a 40
939000	941000	I rolled an 11
941000	943000	A crit success
943000	945000	But we're not contested
945000	947000	Crit beats a 40
947000	949000	Automatically
949000	951000	Crit beats a regular success
951000	953000	So as Keith comes running at Clark
953000	955000	Clark you can describe what you want to do with his body
955000	957000	As he is yelling
957000	959000	At you about the book
959000	961000	What do you want to do with his body?
961000	963000	If you're diving at me I'm just gonna try to spin you past me
963000	965000	You just whiff on me
965000	967000	Maybe I'll throw you to the ground
967000	969000	Fuck Keith
969000	971000	I'm looking up at you from the ground
971000	973000	Eyes wide
973000	975000	Probably pupils
975000	977000	Dilated and I'm
977000	979000	Shaking in like fear
979000	981000	Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
981000	983000	Keith, Keith it's alright
983000	985000	What's going on?
985000	987000	I just
987000	989000	I start to approach him hands up
989000	991000	Kind of like a calm down kind of gesture
991000	993000	I approach him from behind
993000	995000	And slap him twice on both cheeks
995000	997000	To try to calm him down
997000	999000	I've calmed down a little bit but I get up
999000	1001000	And I just start backing away from the both of you
1001000	1003000	Keith it's gone, it's gone
1003000	1005000	It looks like you got it
1005000	1007000	I don't
1007000	1009000	Did you summon that thing here?
1009000	1011000	Summon that thing?
1011000	1013000	How did you?
1013000	1015000	I don't know Keith I don't think I did
1015000	1017000	I keep walking back
1017000	1019000	And my back gets up
1019000	1021000	Into one of the mausoleums and I kind of bump into it
1021000	1023000	And I still like looking back between
1023000	1025000	The both of you and I just
1025000	1027000	I just faint
1027000	1029000	Oh shit
1029000	1031000	Keith
1031000	1033000	Keith
1033000	1035000	John he's out, he's out cold
1035000	1037000	Let me slap him
1037000	1039000	A few times to make sure
1039000	1041000	Slap, slap Keith wakes up
1041000	1043000	Let me slap him, I don't think he's quite awake
1043000	1045000	Let me slap him two more times
1045000	1047000	Slap, slap Here I'll give it a shot, slap
1047000	1049000	So I'm slapped awake and then
1049000	1051000	Slap, slap five times
1051000	1053000	While I'm awake and I
1053000	1055000	Keith you alright? I'm so sorry
1055000	1057000	Did we slap you out of it?
1057000	1059000	You know what?
1059000	1061000	Came over me
1061000	1063000	I'm sorry
1063000	1065000	I didn't
1065000	1067000	My heart is beating like a thousand miles a minute
1067000	1069000	I'm sitting down
1069000	1071000	I look up at both of them
1071000	1073000	I'm really sorry
1073000	1075000	Something in my brain just triggered
1075000	1077000	I don't
1077000	1079000	I'm really sorry I didn't mean to
1079000	1081000	Attack you or accuse you but
1081000	1083000	That thing just fucked me up
1083000	1085000	What you did?
1085000	1087000	Oh
1087000	1089000	I don't know
1089000	1091000	The alien thing yeah the
1091000	1093000	The gray man Was he gray?
1093000	1095000	Translucent He's a
1095000	1097000	He's a man in black right?
1097000	1099000	Did that
1099000	1101000	Did that thing not remind you
1101000	1103000	A little bit of marfing glass?
1103000	1105000	Translucent skin
1105000	1107000	Too big and small
1107000	1109000	At the same time Not enough lipstick
1109000	1111000	What the fuck are we dealing with?
1111000	1113000	Do you have
1113000	1115000	Any idea what book he was talking about?
1115000	1117000	Fellas I mean I don't have
1117000	1119000	Any book
1119000	1121000	I did find a bunch
1121000	1123000	Of papers and documents and books
1123000	1125000	At Jim Cook's house
1125000	1127000	Maggie's father
1127000	1129000	Maggie's father Maggie's father was part
1129000	1131000	Of the circle of knowledge Did you find anything
1131000	1133000	Books that
1133000	1135000	You think he might have been talking about
1135000	1137000	Maybe Do you have them on you? No
1137000	1139000	No they're back at his house I just
1139000	1141000	Left them there where I found them
1141000	1143000	Maggie walked in on me so
1143000	1145000	You didn't pick up any way Maggie walked in on you
1145000	1147000	That's where she found me
1147000	1149000	At Jim's house
1149000	1151000	So it turns out that
1151000	1153000	Maggie's dad was in the circle of knowledge
1153000	1155000	As I was raveling through his papers I did find a leather
1155000	1157000	Bound book that
1157000	1159000	Boy it was
1159000	1161000	It was freaky deaky Like a grimoire
1161000	1163000	Was there anything on the front of it?
1163000	1165000	It was extremely grimoire-ish
1165000	1167000	It was leather bound
1167000	1169000	It was just the circle of knowledge
1169000	1171000	You didn't think that one super weird book
1171000	1173000	You found was the book that fellow was talking about?
1173000	1175000	I mean I didn't have it he kept asking for it
1175000	1177000	I was racking my brain for books
1177000	1179000	That's the one that just now came up
1179000	1181000	Are you sure you don't have it? I don't have it
1181000	1183000	Clark I know where it is
1183000	1185000	Is it on your person right now?
1185000	1187000	No but we can go get it
1187000	1189000	Clark
1189000	1191000	Alright you got me Do you have it?
1191000	1193000	No I don't have it
1193000	1195000	Well so
1195000	1197000	After I shot this thing
1197000	1199000	Did it dissipate too? Yes
1199000	1201000	Did you flip through that book?
1201000	1203000	Did you see what was in it?
1203000	1205000	The thing was that book it was freaky deaky
1205000	1207000	I could only open it to the last page
1207000	1209000	And I mean I could only
1209000	1211000	Open it Was it like
1211000	1213000	Magnets almost?
1213000	1215000	That's what it felt like
1215000	1217000	Magnets you nailed it What did the last thing say?
1217000	1219000	The last page was
1219000	1221000	It had this drawing
1221000	1223000	This hooded figure with light
1223000	1225000	Coming out of its mouth but it wasn't actual light
1225000	1227000	It was just drawn
1227000	1229000	And written over the top of that
1229000	1231000	Over and over and over the entire page
1231000	1233000	It said
1233000	1235000	It is only through death that he may rise again
1237000	1239000	That's all I could see
1239000	1241000	So the drawing
1241000	1243000	What did it look like?
1243000	1245000	It was like black
1245000	1247000	Like if you were to draw black scribbles
1247000	1249000	In the shape of a hooded figure
1249000	1251000	And then leave the middle of it
1251000	1253000	Emanating light out of its mouth
1253000	1255000	I used an eraser there
1255000	1257000	In that part
1257000	1259000	Clark's an artist
1259000	1261000	Whoever drew this picture
1261000	1263000	Clearly had some skill
1263000	1265000	They knew how to use negative space
1265000	1267000	They had a command of negative space
1267000	1269000	That is unrivaled in contention
1273000	1275000	I saw the contention
1275000	1277000	High school art programs
1277000	1279000	Fucking yearly fucking exhibition
1279000	1281000	There's no motherfucking kids in that class
1281000	1283000	Who can do that shit?
1283000	1285000	None of them have command of negative space
1285000	1287000	Fucking balance, color palettes
1287000	1289000	Point of view
1289000	1291000	Perspective
1291000	1293000	As much as I love talking about artwork right now
1293000	1295000	I think we should get the fuck out of this cemetery
1295000	1297000	That's my whole point is that it's fucking terrible
1297000	1299000	If we take it as fact that that's the book it was looking for
1299000	1301000	I might need to tell you a little more about it
1301000	1303000	Yeah, tell us about this
1303000	1305000	I'd love to hear about it
1305000	1307000	This grimoire
1307000	1309000	It's some kind of
1309000	1311000	Word text of some sort for the circle of knowledge
1311000	1313000	And uh
1313000	1315000	It has to do with the revelation
1315000	1317000	Of the overseer
1317000	1319000	What does that mean?
1319000	1321000	Yeah, expand on that
1321000	1323000	From what I've gathered
1323000	1325000	Essentially the circle of knowledge
1325000	1327000	Is hoping to
1327000	1329000	The overseer's maybe a good guy
1329000	1331000	Who lays peace on the world
1331000	1333000	Or something like that
1333000	1335000	Anyway, it's not the big thing I saw
1335000	1337000	The big thing I saw was a scary thing
1337000	1339000	That maybe combats it or something
1339000	1341000	There's some reason they want the overseer
1341000	1343000	Is this the creature you were talking about?
1343000	1345000	It's not, that's what I mean
1345000	1347000	The overseer is maybe the good guy
1347000	1349000	And the thing I saw is the bad guy
1349000	1351000	I don't know, I'm piecing it together as I go
1351000	1353000	Well so, where is this book right now?
1353000	1355000	It's at Jim Cook's house
1355000	1357000	Can I take him there? Do I remember how to get there?
1357000	1359000	Would I remember?
1359000	1361000	I could bring you guys there if you wanted to see it
1361000	1363000	Is that in contention?
1363000	1365000	It's in the city
1365000	1369000	John, I'm remembering something about what I saw
1369000	1371000	When I was John
1371000	1375000	Keith, you got dragged off by those fish men
1375000	1377000	But
1377000	1379000	Clark
1379000	1385000	Old you looked a lot like the fellow you described in that book
1385000	1389000	Robed and with light coming out of the mouth
1389000	1391000	Oh shit
1391000	1393000	Old Clark?
1393000	1397000	Yeah, old Clark made this Clark come back to life
1397000	1399000	Wait, I've been meaning to ask you
1399000	1403000	Where did you get them old fashioned contention PD digs?
1403000	1405000	The circle had them
1405000	1409000	The circle had a beautiful rim that gave me anything I wanted
1409000	1413000	I think that was more mechanical than me
1413000	1417000	They gave you retro like off
1417000	1419000	Keith is looking at both of them
1419000	1421000	I have no fucking idea what you're talking about right now
1421000	1423000	Oh
1423000	1425000	What do you mean by old Clark?
1425000	1427000	I believe Keith Vigna was
1427000	1429000	Fingers deep into boiling water
1429000	1433000	Fishing for crawdads when you guys were discussing this one on one
1433000	1435000	I don't know what you mean by old Clark
1435000	1439000	I was trying to figure out how the hell I'm around since
1439000	1441000	Kevin seemed to know that you were around
1441000	1443000	I asked him
1443000	1445000	How am I alive?
1445000	1447000	And Kevin let me know that he thinks he saw
1447000	1449000	Old me is what he said
1449000	1451000	Old you? What does that mean?
1451000	1453000	Did you say plural?
1453000	1455000	It was an older Clark
1455000	1457000	And he was wearing them ropes
1457000	1459000	And his mouth lit up
1459000	1463000	Just like the figure he was just talking about
1463000	1465000	In the grimoire
1465000	1467000	Like a future version of Clark?
1467000	1473000	Or like a non-bubblegum tree Clark?
1473000	1475000	Old Clark
1475000	1477000	Aged
1477000	1479000	Aged Clark
1479000	1481000	Aged Clark
1481000	1483000	Clark in the future
1483000	1485000	Old Clark
1485000	1491000	I know what old Clark means but is it a future Clark or is it a
1491000	1495000	This is the first I'm hearing about this I'm super confused
1495000	1499000	I'm looking for definitive answers in the middle of this horrifying circumstance
1499000	1501000	Well it seems like both of you know
1501000	1503000	Have heard of this before
1503000	1505000	We just know
1505000	1507000	I mean I don't know about Kevin but I just know that
1507000	1509000	That apparently old Clark
1509000	1511000	Dragged me into a room or something like that
1511000	1513000	Drug me away
1513000	1515000	An older version of you drug you away?
1515000	1517000	Now what happened is
1517000	1519000	An older version of you
1519000	1521000	Showed up, that light came out of his mouth
1521000	1523000	And he reached into you
1523000	1525000	And then you both disappeared
1525000	1527000	Oh
1527000	1529000	Well that makes total sense
1529000	1531000	I get it
1531000	1533000	So we can move on
1537000	1539000	Well thank you for clarifying
1539000	1541000	That does jive
1541000	1543000	I mean if the circle of knowledge
1543000	1545000	Has something to do with the light mouth in the book
1545000	1547000	And then I woke up and then
1547000	1549000	Maggie found me and took me into the circle of knowledge
1549000	1551000	It sounds like they orchestrated it in some way
1551000	1553000	To bring me into the fold
1553000	1555000	I'll accept that for now
1555000	1557000	If you said I blipped out of existence
1557000	1559000	Maybe old me blipped into existence
1559000	1561000	Well if you blipped out of existence
1561000	1563000	Don't you think maybe
1563000	1565000	Is that something like Stan Manstein did?
1565000	1567000	Kinda similar yeah
1567000	1569000	Oh nice
1569000	1571000	Did you see them blip out?
1571000	1573000	Was it the same way that Stan Manstein blipped out?
1573000	1575000	Not quite
1575000	1577000	Did you see where old me came from?
1577000	1579000	No you was
1579000	1581000	You was just approaching
1581000	1583000	Your dead body
1583000	1585000	Old you was
1585000	1587000	And then you did the thing and then you guys were gone
1587000	1591000	Hey well you look good buddy
1591000	1593000	You're looking good yeah
1593000	1595000	Thanks John
1595000	1597000	If none of us know really
1597000	1599000	Let's turn back to the task at hand
1599000	1601000	Somebody's trying to get this book
1601000	1603000	Do you think we should try to go
1603000	1605000	Find that book?
1605000	1607000	I mean
1607000	1609000	We can drive there
1609000	1611000	We can certainly go and get it
1611000	1613000	I don't understand its significance is the only thing
1613000	1615000	It was asking for it
1615000	1617000	That's the book that it wanted
1617000	1619000	I mean we can grab it just to make sure it's in our possession
1619000	1621000	It's in the city
1621000	1623000	Let's get it and then let's go deal with Marvin Glass
1623000	1625000	We ought to drive over there get the book
1625000	1627000	On the way we can call the
1627000	1629000	Quote unquote FBI
1629000	1631000	Oh good idea
1631000	1633000	On the way over there and then we get the book and then
1633000	1635000	You think we go to Glass?
1635000	1637000	Yeah I think we settle business in the city
1637000	1639000	I think so too
1639000	1641000	So we head toward the book we call the FBI
1641000	1643000	And then after that we do the Chewbacca plan with me
1643000	1645000	We take care of business
1645000	1647000	I like it
1647000	1649000	And break
1649000	1651000	Joe roll alertness for me is
1651000	1653000	Clark has the highest
1653000	1655000	Alertness in the group
1655000	1657000	Damn
1657000	1659000	What's a DM4 but for wrecking plans
1659000	1661000	Fuck you Seth
1661000	1663000	Oh that's a hella fail
1663000	1665000	What was I rolling on?
1665000	1667000	Anyway alertness
1667000	1669000	It's a 96 on a 70
1669000	1671000	Well that is a fail indeed
1671000	1673000	Well that was fun with your plans
1673000	1675000	That will certainly happen right now
1675000	1677000	We're already out of the cemetery goodbye
1677000	1679000	So wait how did
1679000	1681000	Both of you arrive here
1681000	1683000	I drove the police car that we took
1683000	1685000	To Glass
1685000	1687000	Oh nice the circle provided me a car
1687000	1689000	Silver Honda Accord
1689000	1691000	Cool okay
1691000	1693000	I came with Rosemary
1693000	1695000	Well do you guys want to take the two cars
1695000	1697000	Or do you just want to hop in the police cruiser
1697000	1699000	Hold on real quick
1699000	1701000	I haven't checked on where Rosemary
1701000	1703000	Is this whole time
1703000	1705000	Are you with Rosemary?
1705000	1707000	I was she was on Overwatch
1707000	1709000	On one of these mausoleums
1709000	1711000	You see her anywhere? She was here
1711000	1713000	Who's got the best search between the three of you
1713000	1715000	I have 40
1715000	1717000	50 I think Clark has the best search
1717000	1719000	No I don't have the best search
1719000	1721000	It's under S
1721000	1723000	I have the baseline I have the 20%
1723000	1725000	Oh shit I have the best search
1725000	1727000	Alright Thomas go ahead and roll
1727000	1729000	Top's bad at searching
1729000	1731000	Okay you look up exactly where she
1731000	1733000	Was and you don't see her
1733000	1735000	Looking around you might even
1735000	1737000	Put your fingers on top of one of these mausoleums
1737000	1739000	And lift yourself up and looking around
1739000	1741000	I do that
1741000	1743000	You see that she's not on any of them
1743000	1745000	But what you do see
1745000	1747000	Is two city police officers
1747000	1749000	Heading straight your way
1749000	1751000	Hey boys
1751000	1753000	Rosemary's not up here but
1753000	1755000	Two city PDR
1755000	1757000	They're hoofing it our way
1757000	1759000	We might want to fucking skedaddle
1759000	1761000	Okay guys follow me back to the police cruiser
1761000	1763000	Let's get the fuck out of here
1763000	1765000	Take the same car? Yeah
1765000	1767000	I think my police cruiser is a little better than your civic
1767000	1769000	So let's get the fuck out of here
1769000	1771000	I wait for John Lee Pettymore
1771000	1773000	To get down from the mausoleum
1773000	1775000	And I start booking it towards
1775000	1777000	Where I parked the police cruiser
1777000	1779000	Okay are you guys just going out the same way you came in
1779000	1781000	Through the normal route
1781000	1783000	That one would take to get from the parking lot
1783000	1785000	To this clearing?
1785000	1787000	Taking directly the route away from the cops
1787000	1789000	Like straight away from them
1789000	1791000	Even if we have to double back
1791000	1793000	We're taking the route that will get us out of sight
1793000	1795000	Of the fuzz
1795000	1797000	Okay I'm going to go ahead and roll real quick
1801000	1803000	As you guys begin to recollect yourselves
1803000	1805000	And head out through the back way
1805000	1807000	You hear
1807000	1809000	Freeze! City PD!
1809000	1811000	We are now in combat order
1811000	1813000	Thank you
1813000	1815000	I turn around
1815000	1817000	Everything's fine fellas
1817000	1819000	I think you have a gun in your hand still?
1819000	1821000	I mean
1821000	1823000	I don't know if I would have had that still in my hand
1823000	1825000	Everything's fine here fellas
1825000	1827000	Contention PD
1827000	1829000	We're getting out of your hair
1829000	1831000	Your jurisdiction is far away from here sir
1831000	1833000	Keep your hands in the air
1833000	1835000	Where we can see them
1835000	1837000	I was gesturing to the coffin
1837000	1839000	Which is open
1839000	1841000	Because I had opened it up
1841000	1843000	We lost a good one in the contention ranks
1843000	1845000	I'm kind of frankly disappointed that you're crashing it like this
1845000	1847000	They both have their guns up
1847000	1849000	And they say
1849000	1851000	Yeah we heard there were some shots
1851000	1853000	That went off during the funeral here
1853000	1855000	I got it under control
1855000	1857000	It was the 21 gun salute you mother fuckers
1859000	1861000	I need you to roll persuade for me Clark
1863000	1865000	Oh I pass
1865000	1867000	I fucking pass a 16 on a 40
1867000	1869000	Alright the police officers
1869000	1871000	Put their guns down and they say
1871000	1873000	I'm glad to see that you got everything under control
1873000	1875000	And they look at
1875000	1877000	Keith who's wearing just these absurd
1877000	1879000	Clothes
1879000	1881000	Is he the one who did it?
1881000	1883000	Nope he's with us he's a member of the Contention PD as well
1883000	1885000	Traditional Contention PD morning clothes
1885000	1887000	I pull my
1887000	1889000	Contention police badge out and I say
1889000	1891000	When I hung out with Ari
1891000	1893000	We always like to go boating
1893000	1895000	These officers
1895000	1897000	They want to know more
1897000	1899000	They start walking up toward you guys
1899000	1901000	And they're like alright well uh
1901000	1903000	Let's get this down here
1903000	1905000	And they pull out a notepad
1905000	1907000	And they're like we need to take statements from all of you
1907000	1909000	I want to move up to intercept him
1909000	1911000	Okay you do so
1911000	1913000	Does Kevin have any kind of identifying information on him
1913000	1915000	Anything that ties him to Marvin Glass
1915000	1917000	You would probably have
1917000	1919000	Yeah you would probably have
1919000	1921000	Like a dirty dog keypad
1921000	1923000	Something like that
1923000	1925000	Okay I pull the dirty dog grooming keypad
1925000	1927000	Out of my chain and I'm like boys
1927000	1929000	I don't think we need to have this conversation
1929000	1931000	I'm with Mr. Glass
1931000	1933000	Oh and they kind of look at each other
1933000	1935000	Oh oh oh
1935000	1937000	And then they start whispering to each other
1937000	1939000	And
1943000	1945000	We are certainly sorry
1945000	1947000	Please give our deepest apologies
1947000	1949000	To Mr. Glass and
1949000	1951000	Actually they cover up their names
1951000	1953000	And badge numbers
1953000	1955000	And they turn
1955000	1957000	And they're like we are so sorry to bother you
1957000	1959000	Also Rip your fallen
1959000	1961000	Police officer sorry to hear about that
1961000	1963000	Sir again
1963000	1965000	Deepest apologies please don't say anything
1965000	1967000	To Mr. Glass we weren't even here
1967000	1969000	That's god damn right
1969000	1971000	And they turn around and they
1971000	1973000	Hoof it
1973000	1975000	Kevin I thought that would work
1975000	1977000	What's the keychain do
1977000	1979000	Oh that's a fun one so the keychain
1979000	1981000	The dirty dog grooming keychains
1981000	1983000	They like open up the door to the fucking
1983000	1985000	Den of Sin and maybe some other
1985000	1987000	Places in his things
1987000	1989000	The Den of Sin?
1989000	1991000	Oh the Den of Sin you know where we were
1991000	1993000	Held as cage fighters
1993000	1995000	I saw a whole rowdy
1995000	1997000	Bunch of degenerates
1997000	1999000	Open up a door on the floor
1999000	2001000	Just in the fucking street
2001000	2003000	Dirty dog grooming keychains
2003000	2005000	That's what John Peters had on him right
2005000	2007000	Yeah that's exactly what John Peters had on him
2007000	2009000	And John Peters we know hung out
2009000	2011000	In the Den of Sin
2011000	2013000	Well he was a dirty degenerate that couldn't
2013000	2015000	Bet for shit
2015000	2017000	Am I the only one who heard that?
2017000	2019000	The Den of Sin is a name I don't know but I do
2019000	2021000	Oh that's where we were
2021000	2023000	The Den of Sin was the name of the place we were at
2023000	2025000	Yeah
2025000	2027000	We found those bedding stubs at John Peters house
2027000	2029000	That tied him to the place
2029000	2031000	And John Peters he was telling a big story
2031000	2033000	He was saying he was all important
2033000	2035000	There wasn't really happening for him
2035000	2037000	There's more to that than I remember
2037000	2039000	Well as these police officers
2039000	2041000	Walk away I look
2041000	2043000	Back at both of my
2043000	2045000	I would say former co-workers
2045000	2047000	And now I think we're
2047000	2049000	Co-workers now again but in a different
2049000	2051000	Capacity and I say
2051000	2053000	Hey well I'm parked over here
2053000	2055000	As you guys begin leaving the
2055000	2057000	Funeral do you want to do anything
2057000	2059000	Here in the clearing before
2059000	2061000	You head out there are three
2061000	2063000	Corpses of basically androids
2063000	2065000	That are laying out
2065000	2067000	And then also the body of Ari
2067000	2069000	Manstein is in her coffin
2069000	2071000	But not in a tomb
2071000	2073000	I believe the funeral might have ended with
2073000	2075000	Placing the coffin in the tomb
2075000	2077000	I want to pay my respects to the androids
2077000	2079000	And
2079000	2081000	And then we probably
2081000	2083000	Need to get on that crank and lower Ari
2083000	2085000	Down
2085000	2087000	Keith walks over to the corral fish boil again
2087000	2089000	And grabs three four more
2089000	2091000	Lose a hit point
2093000	2095000	I think it's cooled down by this point
2097000	2099000	Whoever was manning the fire
2099000	2101000	Has been gone for a minute
2101000	2103000	These are all above ground mausoleums
2103000	2105000	Around us right? Is there one that's obviously
2105000	2107000	The one she was heading toward?
2107000	2109000	There is one with an open door
2109000	2111000	Tomb doors to the mausoleum
2111000	2113000	That is right nearby
2113000	2115000	I grab one of the things that the pallbearers hold
2115000	2117000	The bars on the side of the coffin
2117000	2119000	Let's get her rested
2119000	2121000	Go ahead and grab the other side
2121000	2123000	You pick up the coffin
2123000	2125000	Of Ari Manstein
2125000	2127000	And you begin walking her
2127000	2129000	Into her crypt
2129000	2131000	That she will stay in
2131000	2133000	For the rest of her time
2133000	2135000	Hold on, hold on, hold on
2135000	2137000	Before we take her in here
2137000	2139000	Let's look through this coffin
2139000	2141000	I think Keith
2141000	2143000	I saw Keith run over there earlier
2143000	2145000	We've done this twice already
2145000	2147000	I looked for the book
2147000	2149000	And then I also opened it up earlier
2149000	2151000	To see if she was even in there
2151000	2153000	She was? She is in there
2153000	2155000	And there is no book in there
2155000	2157000	Oh good, okay let's bury her
2157000	2159000	I grab one of the bars
2159000	2161000	And I close the coffin
2161000	2163000	And I think the three of us
2163000	2165000	Start walking into the mausoleum
2165000	2167000	The mausoleum is
2167000	2169000	Completely dark
2169000	2171000	And as you walk in
2171000	2173000	You hear a voice
2173000	2175000	Clark, it's a voice
2175000	2177000	You might recognize
2177000	2179000	Maybe a little bit quicker
2179000	2181000	Than the other two
2181000	2183000	Because it sounds
2183000	2185000	So much like you
2185000	2187000	And looking up
2187000	2189000	You see these little sparks
2189000	2191000	Of light as a voice
2191000	2193000	Rings out chanting
2193000	2195000	In the darkness
2195000	2197000	You see these flashes and sparks
2197000	2199000	Ignited seemingly by this
2199000	2201000	Steady chant
2201000	2203000	It emanates a piece of parchment
2203000	2205000	Held by an old Clark
2205000	2207000	Bishop wearing a dark cloak
2207000	2209000	That is covering almost all of his
2209000	2211000	Face as light begins
2211000	2213000	Emanating from his mouth
2213000	2215000	And the words he's chanting
2215000	2217000	Begin to ignite
2217000	2219000	And the fire lifts off the page
2219000	2221000	And begins to dance in a circle
2221000	2223000	Around you
2223000	2225000	Looking up
2225000	2227000	You all see his lifted hands
2227000	2229000	Are cut open
2229000	2231000	Pouring onto the ground
2231000	2233000	And actually go ahead and roll
2233000	2235000	Sanity for me
2235000	2237000	Fail
2237000	2239000	Over my power
2239000	2241000	Or constitution
2241000	2243000	I fail a 76 on a 19
2243000	2245000	I got a 1
2245000	2247000	Baby
2247000	2249000	Alrighty, so
2249000	2251000	Luke, Keith, he loses
2251000	2253000	No sanity whatsoever
2253000	2255000	He rolled a 1, correct?
2255000	2257000	And then Thomas, John
2257000	2259000	Loses one sanity
2259000	2261000	Clark, you also lose one sanity
2261000	2263000	So this blood is
2263000	2265000	Pooling on the ground
2265000	2267000	Clark and John, both failing their sanity
2267000	2269000	Checks, both drop their load
2269000	2271000	Of the coffin, leaving Keith
2271000	2273000	As the sole support
2273000	2275000	And the coffin hits the ground
2275000	2277000	Ari's corpse, limply plopping
2277000	2279000	Into the muddy blood puddle
2279000	2281000	In this dusty
2281000	2283000	Cold crypt
2283000	2285000	Alternatively, this
2285000	2287000	Logically sashaying fire
2287000	2289000	Surrounds you and bathes
2289000	2291000	All three of you
2291000	2293000	In a comforting, warm
2293000	2295000	Light that feels familiar
2295000	2297000	But the look on Joe's face says
2297000	2299000	Otherwise
2299000	2301000	I am diving directly at old Clark
2301000	2303000	Trying to get him to the ground
2303000	2305000	And as you do so, you grab
2305000	2307000	On to an empty cloak
2307000	2309000	And hit your face directly
2309000	2311000	On the back of this
2311000	2313000	Mausoleum
2313000	2315000	And you just hear his
2315000	2317000	Clark, that's the guy I was talking about
2343000	2345000	How can you
2345000	2347000	Have enough
2347000	2349000	Drowning out
2349000	2351000	All I know
2351000	2353000	Is
2353000	2355000	There's no
2355000	2357000	I don't know
2357000	2359000	I don't know
2359000	2361000	I don't know
2361000	2363000	I don't know
2363000	2365000	I don't know
2365000	2367000	I don't know
2367000	2369000	I don't know
