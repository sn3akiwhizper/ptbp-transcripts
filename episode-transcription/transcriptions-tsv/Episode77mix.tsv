0	2260	Greetings, Dream Babies!
2260	5260	It's your sleepy daddy, Wolf the Dog,
5260	8840	and I am here to snooze 18 hours a day
8840	11940	and eat garbage for the six waking hours.
11940	14520	As for the other four hours in the day?
14520	18180	Well, I try to catch up on my math lessons.
18180	23700	I am yawning at you live from 694.2 PTBP,
23700	29500	the only radio station that definitely penetrates your sleep brainwaves
29500	32500	even when the radio is turned off.
32500	36260	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Ain't Slayed Nobody,
36260	40340	a new actual play podcast playing Down Darker Trails,
40340	43300	the Old West setting for Call of Cthulhu.
43300	47640	They done gone and tagged that pretendin' pod in a tweet, ya hear?
47640	52100	That's some Western talk for you cowpokes out there.
52100	53140	They write,
53140	54440	Dear Wolf,
54440	58180	Isn't it time for a pretendin' to be pups spinoff?
58300	61500	Think of the subscriber counts before you answer.
61500	66800	Anyway, we reckon we were more excited than popcorn on a hot stove
66800	68640	when we earned this announcement.
68640	70480	We have some things in common,
70480	74640	being a comedy horror podcast where we pretend to be people.
74640	78520	In our case, cowpokes, drifters, prospectors.
78520	83700	But the setting don't matter a lick when death is knockin' down the door.
83700	87000	Bein' is where the new kid's on the plane.
87020	92240	We'd sure appreciate anyone who lets us bend their ear for an episode or two.
92240	97700	Did we detect a little Texan accent there beneath the grit, Wolf?
97700	103040	Via con diablos, your friends at Ain't Slayed Nobody.
103040	104700	Now listen here, bub.
104700	110420	I don't do anything I do for some kind of subscriber count.
110420	115040	I do everything I do to whet my own whistle.
115040	116800	But I digress.
116800	121020	That sounds like an interestin' settin' y'all got there.
121020	123520	The Old West.
123520	126400	This Texas you speak of.
126400	129980	I feel as though I may have been there in a past life.
129980	131560	Or a future one.
131560	136520	I have been all places at all times at some point, I am sure.
136520	140240	My existence is persistent like that.
140240	143000	Anyway, it sounds like a good time.
143000	148620	I wish I knew what the fuckin' internet was so I could see a goddamn podcast.
148620	155180	Just a simple tweet with a tag somewhere in it or an Instagram story at Pretending Pod.
155180	156180	That's all it takes.
156180	159640	And then you can write up something for your old Wolfie to howl.
159640	164280	Plus, all your followers will know what kind of filth you're into.
164280	167540	Disclosure is good, my babies.
167540	169280	Disclosure and money.
169280	172680	Wolf the dog has an odd relationship with money.
172680	178400	Paper money is crazy and I don't understand how nobody uses it.
178400	179560	But coin money?
179560	183040	Now that's some shit you can get some grease on, baby.
183040	188160	Grease up them coins and throw them in the bathtub and have yourself a good old time.
188160	193840	And speaking of money, you can use some of yours to support the show over on patreon.com
193840	195800	slash pretending pod.
195800	202400	The month of May will be particularly blessed with an edited bonus episode wherein the boys
202440	207040	take on a legendary house in Call of Cthulhu's The Haunting.
207040	214360	As well as part one and part two, if all goes well, of the scenario voted on by the patrons
214360	221800	Caleb Stokes, lover in the ice, a delta green favorite that gets nasty real quick.
221800	226780	Those in the den of sin can expect a behind the scenes live stream of the recording process
226780	230180	for part two of that game in the next few weeks.
230180	236860	To the den of sin now and see the recorded stream of part one as soon as you join, if
236860	243900	you want to see how the sausage gets played, patreon.com slash pretending pod.
243900	251700	If that felt like an advertisement, then squeeze that grip tighter until I bloop out the news.
251700	258100	Those gosh dang contention police officers woke up in Ari Manstein's tomb again.
258100	264000	It's the third time this story, what in the holy time traveling fuck is going on?
264000	268840	They saved an old woman from a freakishly long limb creature in a black suit.
268840	270640	Wow, that's nice.
270640	271640	Then she died.
271640	273200	That's not as nice.
273200	278400	Keith, John, and Clark tried to convince an otherworldly being they were its deceased
278400	280320	co-worker, Jim Cook.
280320	285080	Realizing quickly that Keith was not Jim, the creature tried to get some info, but due
285080	290440	to the lack of perspective, mostly just fucked with them, knowing it was going to wipe the
290440	293460	memories of the past week at the end of the encounter.
293460	297180	But did our beloved heroes allow themselves to be brain mopped?
297180	299820	Abso-fucking-lutely not.
299820	301900	They remember everything.
301900	305420	And then Drew Andrews pulled up.
305420	311740	A few folks on the fine internet dropped the line to say Drew sounded too confident.
311740	317360	Others suggested this was a more worldly Drew, like he'd seen some shit.
317360	319600	I can't see shit either.
319600	326720	Just a hot pile of yes please and a head full of kudzu with no backbone.
341740	364560	Hey everybody, it's time for episode 77 with my best friends, Thomas and Luke and Joe and
364560	365640	everybody.
365640	371600	We can't sing on the Zoom call together cause there's lag and you can't sing with me.
371600	381320	Do you want to go ahead and get a cut of you introducing that better?
381320	387080	Thomas can suck my dick, I would like it, he is my least favorite person in the world
387080	392460	except for he's not, I am a dirty liar and I love him so dearly and I miss kissing his
392460	393460	face.
393460	394460	Oh boy.
394460	395460	Face.
395460	396460	Me.
396460	398600	I miss kissing your faces too.
398600	403480	I wanted to start today with a quick game where we try to kiss each other's faces.
403480	411120	So we play the Price is Right rules with the mechanics of this game so real quick I want
411120	420240	everyone to answer on like 3, 2, 1 you say us or you on who wins a roll.
420240	428000	So who wins if I roll a 52 on a 50 and you roll a 51 on a 60?
428000	429000	3, 2, 1.
429000	430000	Us.
430000	431000	Yes, nice.
431000	432000	Us.
432000	436440	And if I roll a 0, 7 on a 40 and you roll a 45 on a 45?
436440	437440	Us.
437440	438440	Us.
438440	443360	And if I roll a 44 on a 70 and you roll an 11 on a 50?
443360	444360	Us.
444360	446640	I don't know on that one actually.
446640	450900	I think you, it's two crits versus you get the higher crit.
450900	451900	What happens?
451900	454560	In two crit situations the higher crit wins.
454560	455560	You.
455560	456880	Unless it's a 1.
456880	457880	Unless it's a 1.
457880	460680	I've got one last one for you.
460680	468600	If I roll a 0, 1 on a 10 and you roll a 69 on a 60?
468600	469600	Us.
469600	470600	Us.
470600	472840	Because that's a crit fail for us.
472840	476720	No, no, isn't 69 always a critical success, right?
476720	477720	I don't know that one.
477720	478720	And it trumps all of these?
478720	479880	No, does it trump all others?
479880	480880	It trumps a 1?
480880	482640	We've never, I guess it does.
482640	484880	It's the crit.
484880	485880	It's the crit.
485880	486880	It's the crit.
486880	489680	So thank you.
489680	492880	You all did very well, almost perfect.
492880	495580	But yeah, no, it's good to get that out.
495580	498160	A solid C.
498160	500200	So here are your degrees.
500200	501200	Who's it signed by?
501200	503680	Oh gosh, who would it be signed by?
503680	504680	The Hamburglar.
504680	505680	Zach.
505680	506680	Zacho.
506680	513840	This is great, I feel like we're in the last scene of A New Hope where they're getting
513840	514840	their awards.
514840	518600	Yeah, so if you could all just bend down.
518600	522640	I was trying to remember a scene in New Hope where they were like quizzing each other on
522640	523640	numbers.
523640	525640	I couldn't come up with that scene.
525640	528600	It's when they were trying to get into Mensa.
528600	530560	Chewie loses.
530560	532160	He freaks out.
532160	539440	Drew just pulled up in the red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse, rolls down the window, hello contention
539440	542920	police officers, please get in the car and come with me.
542920	543920	Drew.
544000	546000	So good to see you, Drew.
546000	547000	Wait, what?
547000	550480	You are, and you are, and you, who are you?
550480	558800	Oh, hey Drew, well, I'm John Lee Kevin Moore in a manner of speaking.
558800	569680	You see, Kevin was Marvin Glass's main enforcer along with Rosemary, but he was actually the
569680	576080	lobotomized, I mean, completely brain-removed body of my, of my father.
576080	578000	Oh my god.
578000	579000	This is John.
579000	583840	I'm John, yeah, I'm John, and I'm in this body now.
583840	587000	John Lee Pettymore, the missing John Lee Pettymore?
587000	588560	Is that what they're calling me?
588560	593840	Well, John Lee Pettymore the third disappeared so long ago and everyone just assumed he died.
593840	594840	Right.
594840	595840	I...
595840	597040	Yes, he did, right?
597040	598040	I don't understand.
598440	605360	Well, I'm looking at you right now, I'm so, but you're saying that you are, now Drew has
605360	614400	been through a lot with you guys, and he did, in fact, witness the Cat Man switching bodies,
614400	616160	so this is, um...
616160	618800	He can roll with the idea of somebody being in somebody else's body.
618800	619800	I like what you're saying here.
619800	620800	A little bit better, yeah.
620800	626520	He's gonna be able to slightly understand that, and so John Lee Pettymore the fourth
626520	635400	is in the body of John Lee Pettymore the third, and your body is, where's your body?
635400	639480	Well, my body was rendered useless.
639480	644640	You know what, we can get into all this later, I don't really know if we have time to explain
644640	646120	ball to you.
646120	647280	What's contention like?
647280	651560	Oh, we have to get back, I mean, we are in desperate need of help.
651880	659400	Okay, so contention is working still, yes, of course, and we're working on puddle teaming
659400	662200	everywhere, so basically what we gotta do-
662200	663200	Puddle teaming?
663200	667200	Puddle teaming, yeah, so you guys should probably come, I mean, that's why I'm here, I'm here
667200	671680	to come get you so that you can come back to contention and help, because you are the
671680	675760	only police officers that we had, and you all abandoned us, and I wanted to come find
675760	679360	you and bring you back so that you could help us, thank you so much for doing that, but
679360	688800	we have these deep man-made puddles all over contention so that if somebody sees the residue
688800	695840	coming then you can jump into the puddle that's teaming, right, so, baths.
695840	697800	Whose idea was this, Drew?
697800	699040	Did you organize this, Drew?
699040	706200	Oh gosh, no, it was Pastor Adam Cain, it was Pastor Adam Cain that did that, and he's
706200	707200	taken over.
707200	708200	Did you call him daddy?
709040	715600	What, no, it's just, it's a fun, it's a fun thing, he's like kind of, um, okay, so contention's
715600	721240	pretty wrecked, right, and so we needed a leader, and Pastor Adam Cain is taking care
721240	728960	of everyone at the First Creek family at contention, and so everyone is there, and that's how we're
728960	730440	staying safe.
730440	733080	Uh, how long have we been gone?
733080	736640	Oh yeah, no, this all popped up in like a day.
736640	745000	Yeah, well I mean, I just want it to be known we didn't abandon you, we were pursuing leads,
745000	746000	relevant leads.
746000	748000	We're professionals, Drew, you should know this by now.
748000	752640	Yeah, we were just doing our jobs, I mean, we eliminated a couple huge threats to the
752640	760320	town, Marvin Glass won't be sticking his weird looking face in our business anymore, for
760320	766620	one, cause he's dead, or maybe he's not dead yet in this timeline, but he will be due to
766620	768260	our actions in the past.
768260	771260	You haven't seen us since we left contention, right?
771260	772260	No?
772260	773260	Okay, good.
773260	774260	Wait, what?
774260	775260	Probably.
775260	776260	Don't worry about it.
776260	778940	We'll explain all of this on the way back to contention.
778940	780500	Have you been receiving calls from us?
780500	782380	Have you, has your phone been off or something?
782380	789900	Oh, I, and pulls out a burner, and is like, sorry, I had to get a burner cause I got wet.
789900	791980	I had to jump in a puddle.
791980	795380	You said, you said that you got this puddle teaming thing going on, and you got people
795380	798020	who are jumping into puddles if they see the ooze.
798020	799500	Are you able to see the ooze now?
799500	802220	No, no, we use kids and crazy people.
802220	803340	Kids can see the ooze.
803340	808640	Yeah, maybe that was just a bit too much tell, not show, but yeah, we use kids and crazy
808640	810980	people to do it because they can see the ooze.
810980	820600	No, I think me and my partners are all glad you told us, instead of relying on us to see
820600	823780	those details.
823820	826020	So kids and crazy folks, huh?
826020	833700	Yeah, they can see it for some reason, so basically we use them to scout locations,
833700	837420	but these puddles are everywhere, you know, it's really good.
837420	839020	We also call it bass brimming.
839020	842820	Alright, what do you do with people when their foot gets too pruney?
842820	847500	Oh no, it doesn't take long, you just stay in there for like ten minutes and then the
847500	848980	residue will move away.
848980	850620	It seems like a pretty good system.
850620	854140	I mean, we can't live like this forever, is what I'm trying to say.
854140	855140	We're trying to come up with a solution.
855140	857580	Well, people have been through worse, Drew, you know.
857580	858660	I don't think they have.
858660	860220	Throughout human history.
860220	866420	Then being hunted by an unknown ooze that most of them can't see unless they're crazy?
866420	867420	Yeah.
867420	870500	Oh, okay, the war, you know.
870500	873540	I mean, it just seems like you got the puddles.
873540	878500	I agree that the implementation has been fantastic and the safety, thank you for saying that,
878500	883180	the safety measures taken have been very good, but what we are trying to do now is
883180	889540	get back to a sense of normalcy and we would appreciate having the police officers of contention
889540	891420	help us in that regard.
891420	896820	Well, okay, of course we will come back and help you, but it is way too soon, I think,
896820	904020	to close the puddles.
904020	907460	I walk over to the passenger's side and get in.
907460	912060	Drew, you say you want to return to a sense of normalcy and that you guys have been working
912060	913060	on ideas.
913060	917620	Have you or Pastor Adam Cain come up with any ideas that seem viable so far?
917620	919820	I'm sorry, Daddy Cain is who he means.
919820	921260	Oh, no, you can call him.
921260	922940	You can call him pastor.
922940	923940	It's fine.
923940	926700	You know, it's just, anyway, what was the question?
926700	930460	Do you have any ideas, any thoughts on any theories?
930460	936020	Have you developed any idea about how to maybe vanquish the ooze once and for all?
936020	944260	Okay, so we can collect it with fish.
944260	945260	With fish?
945260	946260	Go on.
946260	947260	Right.
947260	948260	So how'd you figure that one out?
948260	949260	Oh, okay.
949260	956140	So I wasn't there, but apparently a fish can like gather the residue, it like sucks up
956140	960540	into it, basically into its mouth and then you can squeeze it out.
960540	961540	To what end?
961540	962540	Oh, to get rid of it.
962540	969380	I mean, if you needed to put it all somewhere, right, so we're just kind of collecting fish
969380	970380	that have it.
970380	972500	How do you know if the fish have it?
972500	976980	What you're saying is the pastor is collecting all of the ooze in one place?
976980	979700	Oh, yeah, I guess you could say that is what we're doing.
979700	981260	Oh, my God.
981260	985460	Is he putting it into like barrels or how's he collecting it in one place?
985460	986460	I don't know.
986460	987460	I'm not there.
987460	988460	I don't like the sound of that.
988460	990340	Okay, I think we need to go talk to this guy.
990340	991900	We need to get back to contention.
992340	995540	Remind me not to eat Nia's fish fry on Friday.
995540	999340	How quote unquote crazy would a feller have to be to see the ooze?
999340	1000340	Oh, um.
1000340	1004880	If you put a numerical value on your sanity from one to 100, sure, sure.
1004880	1011460	What threshold might you say someone would start to see the ooze?
1011460	1016860	I think it's totally a matter of either losing five or more at once or hitting a breaking
1016860	1019820	point or going to zero.
1020820	1027300	That's a very concise and to the point and I appreciate how you ran with my metaphor
1027300	1028300	straight away.
1028300	1029300	Yeah, you picked that up real quick.
1029300	1030300	That was good.
1030300	1033100	I'm just trying to be more forthright here in the end times.
1033100	1035940	Hey, Drew, did you ever get that cat carrier we sent you off for?
1035940	1036940	Yeah, of course.
1036940	1037940	All right, just checking.
1037940	1038940	I mean.
1038940	1042340	Hey, have you been spending your money?
1042340	1044340	Yeah, no.
1044340	1045340	No.
1045340	1047580	Yeah, that sounds rad.
1048340	1049340	Hey, the feller we sold it to.
1049340	1050340	He's dead.
1050340	1051340	Wait, what?
1051340	1052340	Yeah.
1052340	1053340	The Duke is dead?
1053340	1054340	It was Keith's brother.
1054340	1055340	The Duke was Ferguson Beans?
1055340	1056340	Yeah.
1056340	1057340	And Keith killed him.
1057340	1060020	Why don't we talk about it on the way back?
1060020	1061020	Okay.
1061020	1062020	Montage.
1062020	1064020	Road trip montage to contention.
1064020	1069020	Road trip montage to contention.
1069020	1076620	Drew looks at you guys and is like, so you guys had the gun and the camera and the Nike
1076660	1077660	bag.
1077660	1081020	Do you guys have all those with you?
1081020	1084620	The gun and the camera are back at Marvin's, but don't worry.
1084620	1088380	We've got a plan that eventually our past selves are going to pop out of the ground
1088380	1089740	and then we're going to go and get them.
1089740	1090740	So don't worry about that.
1090740	1091740	Thank you.
1091740	1092740	Say that again.
1092740	1094420	How much time do you reckon we have to get back to contention?
1094420	1100660	Like could we maybe go run and see a movie and wait until the wee morning hours to leave
1100660	1101660	the city?
1101660	1105620	Because if we do, then we could bring the gun and the camera back.
1105620	1107020	Does he have the bag too?
1107020	1108020	Yeah.
1108020	1109900	Marvin's got that bag too, huh?
1109900	1110900	So yeah.
1110900	1116740	I mean, if you think people could, uh, you know, puddle it out for another 12 to 18 hours
1116740	1122060	say, and until we can just stroll on into that glass compound, which will pretty soon
1122060	1123500	be, be ruined.
1123500	1125100	How is it going to be ruined?
1125100	1131400	Well, uh, a pretty funny sequence of events, honestly, we could probably just go get some
1131400	1139960	seats and watch it happen again, if you think we can, we can spare the time.
1139960	1145040	I mean, do you need us back in contention by this evening or can we, can we wait until,
1145040	1149820	you know, maybe we get the gun and the camera and then hit up a diner and get a nice like
1149820	1153120	breakfast and then head back to contention tomorrow morning.
1153120	1154360	There is something in contention.
1154360	1157520	I think that would be important for us to check out.
1157520	1158520	What's that?
1158520	1159520	What's that?
1159520	1164900	I'll just show you then to explain, but we need to go back to my, my hotel first and
1164900	1166360	it'll make a lot more sense.
1166360	1169120	Are you talking about checking on your, on your dog?
1169120	1170440	Oh shit.
1170440	1177880	Yeah, I guess I do need to do that too.
1177880	1179240	That's my question to Drew.
1179240	1184120	Drew, do you think we need the gun and the camera and the Nike bag before we head back
1184120	1185120	to contention?
1185120	1186120	Okay.
1186120	1187120	Here's what I'm going to say.
1187120	1193160	I think that having the gun and the camera and the Nike bag would be a huge plus.
1193160	1200840	However, the most important thing is that you guys come back with me to contention.
1200840	1207640	I will say though, if we do wait, contention will be a different place when we get there.
1207640	1208640	I'm sure of it.
1208640	1210640	What do you mean by that?
1210640	1211640	That doesn't sound good.
1211640	1216740	No, I just mean like I have a feeling the situation happening in contention currently
1216740	1222700	will have changed, maybe even escalated if we were to not handle it currently.
1222700	1223700	Sure.
1223700	1224700	Sure.
1224700	1225700	If we were to go do something else.
1225700	1229740	It's entirely up to you guys because there's three of you and there's only one of me.
1229740	1232940	And this whole fish thing collecting the ooze.
1232940	1234480	Oh right, yeah.
1234480	1238140	The pastor rubbed me wrong the first time I met him anyway, so.
1238140	1239660	The pastor did what to you?
1239660	1242340	He was not very welcoming to me.
1242340	1245260	I find that deeply hard to understand.
1245260	1246660	What a wise man.
1246660	1250100	You know, Keith kind of, Keith that up to be honest.
1250100	1253460	Have you always had this admiration for pastor Adam Cain or is that a risk to them?
1253460	1257060	It's just that when someone steps up in the face of crisis, you have to give thanks where
1257060	1258060	thanks is due.
1258060	1263100	Drew, you haven't, you haven't tithed to this fella, have you?
1263100	1265100	Roll human.
1265100	1270060	Ooh, 55, what do I have?
1270060	1274660	Fuck, I've got a 50, so critical fail.
1274660	1276460	Dang!
1276460	1277580	Don't leap anymore.
1277580	1282340	No matter which body you're in, I think that you of all people would understand that what
1282340	1286380	is Drew Andrews' money is Drew Andrews' money.
1286380	1289700	Alright, just don't get taken for a fool.
1289700	1294700	No one could ever call me a fool.
1294700	1299900	Wow, that sounded really ominous.
1299900	1301060	And forceful for you, Drew.
1301060	1303460	Drew, have you ever branded somebody a fool?
1303460	1305140	I've been gone for one day, maybe.
1305140	1308320	You've been gone for one day and like, I know we said the whole thing, but you think
1308320	1311980	I started branding people with my newfound fame and fortune?
1311980	1313520	Not fame, but fortune?
1313520	1315620	I'd like to human this.
1315620	1316620	No.
1316620	1318620	No, okay, good.
1318620	1324300	I, for one, am going to throw the hat in the ring that I don't know what the gun and the
1324300	1325300	camera help us much down there.
1325300	1326300	Yeah, we don't really know how to use them.
1326300	1327580	I think we should get down there, do what we can first.
1327580	1329880	Do we have one name left on us or two?
1329880	1330880	We got two.
1330880	1331880	We got Tildy.
1331880	1333420	Okay, so this isn't-
1333420	1335260	And uh, Drew?
1335260	1336460	We don't need to bring everything.
1336460	1337460	Wait, hold on.
1337460	1338460	You guys have my name on you?
1338460	1340060	Two contention to wrap it all up.
1340060	1341780	No, no, no, it's uh-
1341780	1342780	You're on our mind.
1342780	1347540	Keith was just about to say, Drew, you're uh, it's so great that you came and got-
1347540	1353040	Yeah, I was gonna say we got Tildy written on us and Drew, this is another thing we'll
1353040	1356060	have to explain on the way, but we got names written on us.
1356060	1359060	Wait, okay, you got my name written on you and-
1359060	1360380	No, no, no, no, no.
1360380	1361380	Oh, you got Tildy?
1361780	1362780	I mean, Keith, you just-
1362780	1364780	Even though that is what it sounded like Keith was saying again, you just said it.
1364780	1366620	He just said the word almost exactly, word for word.
1366620	1367620	I mean, it sounded like-
1367620	1368620	I, I interrupted myself.
1368620	1371140	Do you even know what you're talking about, Keith Vigno?
1371140	1378300	When you speak, do you ever know what's coming out of your mouth?
1378300	1379300	Bubble gum tree.
1379300	1382020	Now, Drew, you don't get to talk to him like that.
1382020	1383020	Bubble gum tree.
1383020	1384020	Oh yeah.
1384020	1385020	Okay.
1385020	1387400	He could just be repeating what we said, bubble gum tree.
1387400	1390620	He could just be repeating what we said, bubble gum tree.
1391020	1392020	Oh God.
1392020	1393020	Oh shit.
1393020	1396540	But yeah, I do wonder, is this the real Drew Andrews?
1396540	1398920	Tell us something Drew Andrews would know.
1398920	1405660	I sold a pallet of cocaine with John Lee Pettymore IV for $10 million to the Duke.
1405660	1406660	No, everybody knows that.
1406660	1408940	Wow, Drew, you just said that out loud with other officers in the car.
1408940	1409940	This was a sting, Drew.
1409940	1415420	Drew looks around to see if there's anybody besides you guys in the car.
1415420	1416540	I thought they knew.
1416540	1418700	I'm just messing with you, Drew.
1418700	1419700	I know about it.
1419780	1421060	I'm disappointed in it, but.
1421060	1423060	What's your cousin's name?
1423060	1424060	Emmett.
1424060	1426060	He's the EMT.
1426060	1428580	Yeah, Emmett the EMT.
1428580	1429580	Okay.
1429580	1433740	If you're still wondering who I am, Keith Vigna, thank you very much.
1433740	1441500	I went and picked up a cat carrier to go take a cat that had the soul of an FBI agent inside
1441500	1442740	of it.
1442740	1445300	So maybe don't question me.
1445300	1446300	Okay.
1446300	1447300	Okay.
1447300	1449060	We just got to be careful, you know.
1449460	1453620	Well, if he is fake, he's a very good facsimile, so.
1453620	1456780	I get behind him and start peeling his face off.
1456780	1459220	No, I don't do that.
1459220	1461740	It would be really hard.
1461740	1466060	Drew, can you take us to my hotel?
1466060	1467660	Yeah, real quick.
1467660	1469700	Who has the best humant?
1469700	1470700	I have 80.
1470700	1477060	Oh, go ahead and roll that 80.
1477060	1478060	Check that out.
1479060	1481220	I can't see what that says.
1481220	1483220	It's a 79 on an 80.
1483220	1484220	Oh, nice.
1484220	1486900	Keith Vigna, you know that something is up.
1486900	1489900	Drew is acting strange, obviously.
1489900	1495180	That's why you questioned him on it, but he definitely skipped out on the question of
1495180	1498380	how he knew where you were.
1498380	1499380	Yeah.
1499380	1507740	John Lee Pettymore's eyes roll back in his head and he feels 10 points lucky.
1507740	1508740	Unluckier-less.
1508740	1509740	Unluckier?
1509740	1510740	Luckless.
1510740	1511740	Can we watch this?
1511740	1512740	No, I'm gonna kick you out.
1512740	1513740	Hey, Thomas.
1513740	1514740	Hey, Zach.
1514740	1529460	What are you looking for in the deep depths of John Lee Pettymore's mind?
1529460	1535740	John Lee Pettymore is going to use his clairvoyance talent by spending 10 luck, and he wants to
1535740	1539500	know if this Drew can be trusted.
1539500	1542780	Like even if it is the real Drew, can we still trust Drew?
1542780	1545500	John Lee Pettymore as your...
1545500	1546500	Sorry.
1546500	1547500	John Lee Kevinmore.
1547500	1554260	What I have on my character sheet is Kevin John Pettymore the third.
1554260	1556060	I love it.
1556060	1557060	Kevin John Pettymore the third.
1557060	1559920	But I think John Lee Pettymore the third works too.
1559920	1561580	John Lee Pettymore the third.
1561580	1569700	Your eyes roll into the back of your head and you see a reflection, it's your daddy.
1569700	1575740	Well it's the body you're in currently, but it's back when he was still your daddy.
1575740	1577960	You recognize the face from pictures.
1577960	1581700	The reflection is poor, clouded and gray.
1581700	1583580	It's a television screen.
1583580	1591260	Then the television turns on, and you see the empty interior of the contention police
1591260	1592260	station.
1592260	1593260	And it's a mess.
1593260	1594260	It's a wreck.
1594260	1596460	There's water that's been splashed all over the place.
1596460	1602620	There's files just like riddling over the floor, over everything.
1602620	1606500	It's where it's in the state that you last saw it.
1606500	1608480	And the channel changes.
1608480	1614840	You see Jim Cook in an abandoned gas station briefing three familiar faces you recognize
1614840	1622480	from a file in Marvin Glass's compound as a team called K-Cell, comprised of this young
1622480	1630100	John Lee Pettymore the third, aka Kevin, a man called Kyle, and Karen, which is the alias
1630100	1632300	of Anne Love.
1632300	1638460	As the three are leaving this derelict come and go, you see Jim Cook calls Karen back
1638460	1641260	real quick to have a word in private.
1641260	1644060	The channel changes.
1644060	1650820	Back in the disheveled contention police station, Drew Andrews leans on a two-tiered plastic
1650820	1654520	cart as he pushes it towards the evidence room.
1654520	1661180	He punches in the code, enters with an empty cart, and rolls on out with the radio on top
1661260	1663820	and the helmet on bottom.
1663820	1670780	And that helmet is sitting on the briefcase that you know contains Drew's cut.
1670780	1673900	Five million dollars.
1673900	1679860	The channel changes, and you see Drew pushing this full cart up through the sanctuary of
1679860	1688020	the First Church of Contention, which is hard to recognize with all of its pews removed.
1688020	1690860	And the TV turns off, click.
1690860	1698020	But then, the glass of the television screen slowly rolls down like a car window as Karen
1698020	1700140	screams.
1700140	1705140	She's holding these two people at gunpoint in their own hallway just to the right of
1705140	1709660	you, and they refuse to tell her what she wants to know.
1709660	1711460	Where is it?
1711460	1714620	She screams behind the screen.
1714620	1720260	Inside this television, you see there's a book.
1720260	1727060	It seems to be made of a strange, uncured leather that's got like, maybe some hair on
1727060	1728060	it?
1728060	1729060	A few freckles?
1729060	1731300	It's the human book.
1731300	1738100	You blink, and you're staring at your reflection again in this completely normal television
1738100	1739300	screen.
1739300	1746220	You stand up and turn to Karen, who is now maniacally laughing as she shoves her pistol
1746220	1751160	into the man's mouth while forcing the woman to watch.
1751160	1758760	You feel a decision inside yourself being made.
1758760	1759760	It's not here.
1759760	1765940	I mean, he talks like that now, but it probably sounded normal back then.
1765940	1766940	It's not here.
1766940	1772140	Hey, we got it.
1772140	1779580	Karen's eyes light up as she begins chanting in some tongue, either ancient or alien, and
1779580	1787640	this couple begins rising slowly, steadily off the carpet.
1787640	1789220	Do I recognize the couple?
1789220	1790220	Yeah, you've seen-
1790220	1791480	Is it Clark's parents?
1791480	1792480	It's Clark's parents.
1792480	1795140	It's Eunice and Jerry Bishop, Clark's parents.
1795140	1800740	You've seen their picture every day for a while sitting on Clark Bishop's desk.
1800740	1807140	Your vision shifts completely to a close-up of a man's left hand.
1807140	1814060	Blood is flowing down from his forearm and dripping from his fingers, and you see Drew
1814060	1827000	Andrews lean into frame and kiss the ring on this man's hands, bloody fourth digit.
1827000	1831680	What I'm getting from my question, can we trust Drew, is no.
1831680	1836120	Yeah, I think that's going to be a no dog.
1836120	1837120	Okay.
1837120	1839680	Did Keith say he was in the front seat or the back seat?
1839680	1840680	Front seat.
1840680	1843680	I'm going to say I am directly behind him.
1843680	1844680	Okay.
1844680	1845680	Do you want me to bring the other two back?
1845680	1853840	Right rear passenger seat, yes.
1853840	1861660	All right, John Lee Pettymore III is 10 luck lighter as his eyes immediately come fluttering
1861660	1870360	back into reality, and he looks to his left and sees Clark Bishop in the back seat right
1870360	1871360	next to him.
1871360	1872360	Are we driving right now?
1872360	1877040	As you're driving, yeah, on the highway towards contention, and Keith Vigna is up sitting
1877040	1883320	shotgun with Drew Andrews driving this red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse.
1883600	1887800	I've seen it before, and it led to good things, so I just let it happen.
1887800	1892520	I might, you know what I'll do, I'll like tap Keith on the shoulder and just kind of
1892520	1893520	point.
1893520	1894520	He's doing the thing.
1894520	1895520	Remember?
1895520	1896520	He was able to like see things last time.
1896520	1897520	And then he's back.
1897520	1898520	I don't know what the-
1898520	1902960	Uh, hey Drew, can you pull off at the next exit?
1902960	1905320	I'm so sorry, but I really have to pee.
1905320	1911640	This old body, the bladder isn't, you know, not as strong as I'm used to.
1911640	1918040	I'm still adjusting to the new Corpus, so, uh, could we, could we pl- I just, I'm about,
1918040	1923700	I'm about to piss all over your car if we don't, you know, pull over right, right, right
1923700	1925640	now at this next exit at this gas station.
1925640	1927200	That really freaks Keith out.
1927200	1931840	Hey, Jon, I understand that maybe when you're in an older body, you know, some bodily functions
1931840	1936440	don't work the same way that we used to, and, you know, you're not as trained in knowing
1936440	1941840	when your body needs to go, but I ain't gonna need you to maybe just like hold it because
1941840	1945960	as you well know, there aren't any gas stations in between the city and contention, it's only
1945960	1946960	an hour drive.
1946960	1949840	Uh, uh, okay, well, um, I lied.
1949840	1952160	I don't need to pee.
1952160	1955760	I'm about to shit my pants.
1955760	1960120	I'm gonna shit, and this car is gonna smell like shit the whole ride.
1960120	1961120	Please pull over, Drew.
1961120	1962120	Oh, Drew, please pull over, we don't want that.
1962120	1966080	These guys have some bad memories about an old man shittin' all over the place, it'll
1966080	1968700	probably make them barf all over the car.
1968700	1971080	It's just because of the memories, though.
1971080	1973400	Even if we just find a field or something.
1973400	1974920	Oh, no!
1974920	1981800	Exactly, yeah, so, uh, yeah, I mean, I like just pull over on the side of the road and
1981800	1984560	I will go shit in that long grass, I swear to God.
1984560	1987520	Yeah, no, of course, for sure.
1987520	1989760	Uh, yeah, I'll drive you.
1989760	1994840	He sees this like little country road that's going off, little gravel road.
1994880	2000320	Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll take this, turns off, and drives down it just a little bit, and
2000320	2002840	then is like, hey, do you think here is fine?
2002840	2006960	Yeah, yeah, oh my God, just pull over, just pull over to the side of the road.
2006960	2009880	You're next to a cornfield, but it's December.
2009880	2012040	Perfect, perfect.
2012040	2015880	So it's just flat land that you can clearly see through.
2015880	2018040	I'll just, I'll just, I'll just duck down low.
2018040	2022480	As we're pulling in, I'm nervous and I have my hand on my gun, but not like out.
2022480	2028120	I think Clark is oblivious, he's thinking, oh shit, John's got a shit.
2028120	2031760	To that end, uh, John steps hard on your toe.
2031760	2033360	Oops, John, you got me on my foot there.
2033360	2037560	John gives, gives Clark, like he, he stares daggers at him.
2037560	2039320	Okay, so the car has stopped.
2039320	2043200	The car, as soon as the car stops, John pulls his gun on Drew.
2043200	2045040	As soon as I see that, I pull my gun on Drew too.
2045040	2046680	All of our eyes just got so big.
2046680	2049000	Clark doesn't pull his gun right away and is startled.
2049040	2053080	John says to Drew, put it in park or I'll blow your brains out.
2053080	2054720	Oh, John, John, John, fellas.
2054720	2056600	Put it in fucking park, Drew.
2056600	2059600	Drew puts the car in park.
2059600	2061920	Take the keys out and hand them to Keith.
2063640	2066500	Drew takes the keys out and hands them to Keith.
2067520	2072280	All right, now slowly exit the vehicle.
2072280	2076240	Clark, Clark, you get out too and you keep them covered.
2076240	2078600	As soon as he's out, I want you to put them in handcuffs.
2079360	2080520	This ain't our Drew.
2080520	2083080	Oh, it ain't our Drew.
2083080	2083920	Money changed.
2083920	2085440	Clark has gone ahead and starting to get out.
2085440	2086840	I answered all your questions.
2086840	2088200	I answered all your questions.
2088200	2090280	I don't know why you don't think I'm me.
2090280	2092160	It happened all the sudden.
2092160	2094960	John, I mean, you're not even John, what's going on?
2094960	2095800	Hold on just a second.
2095800	2097400	Murphy keeps barking at the door.
2098720	2100120	What the hell did that mean?
2104260	2105680	I think he's got a shit real bad.
2105680	2106500	Murphy's barking at the door.
2106500	2107340	He's barking at the door.
2107340	2108340	That's what it means.
2115700	2118020	I know you already said you have to go poop.
2119820	2124820	Drew Andrews slowly opens the driver's side of this car.
2125580	2126980	Get on him, Clark, cover him.
2126980	2127820	I'm doing it.
2127820	2129940	And hands in the air.
2129940	2132760	Okay, guys, I don't know what's going on here,
2132760	2134020	but I would really thank you
2134020	2136020	to not do whatever you're about to do.
2136020	2136860	Drew.
2137380	2138220	Drew.
2138220	2141060	Drew, stop talking.
2141060	2143300	Stop talking right now, Drew.
2143300	2145260	I'm putting his hands behind his back
2145260	2149060	and I'm saying, Drew, I'm sorry, but I got to trust
2149060	2151660	my partner here and I'm cuffing him.
2151660	2154860	Okay, yeah, I mean, Drew's not gonna resist.
2154860	2155700	Drew.
2155700	2157700	Wait, hey, I turn back to you.
2157700	2159720	All right, John, what's going on here?
2159720	2161680	I don't like having Drew in handcuffs.
2161680	2162520	This isn't right.
2162520	2164040	I know, he knows it too.
2165040	2168320	Ever since I came back into this body,
2168320	2171960	I've had the ability to peer beyond the veil.
2171960	2173720	Now it takes something from me,
2173720	2178080	but I can see moments from this sphere
2178080	2179880	in which I did not participate.
2179880	2181260	Like the future or?
2181260	2182660	And the past.
2182660	2184760	This time it was just the past
2184760	2189480	and what I saw in the past was that Drew took the radio,
2189480	2192880	the helmet, and all his money from the evidence locker
2193840	2195780	and gave it to the church.
2195780	2200120	And then he kissed some creepy bloody hand with a ring,
2200120	2202220	a wedding band on its finger.
2202220	2204240	So Drew, my question to you
2204240	2207080	is why did you take those items to the church?
2207080	2208880	I mean, it's simple really.
2208880	2213880	When someone is quick to take control of a situation,
2214720	2216000	then they have all the power
2216000	2219480	and people who have all the power have the ability
2219480	2222760	to make other people do things that they may not wanna do
2223600	2224500	and I was one of those people
2224500	2227560	who was made to do something that I didn't wanna do.
2227560	2231000	They said that I could be saved.
2231000	2234360	I could have my life, I could be safe
2234360	2236280	if I brought these things
2236280	2241280	and so it was my only option.
2241800	2243000	Oh, Drew.
2243000	2246200	Drew, you didn't think to ask us or call us?
2246200	2247040	Roll a human.
2247040	2247880	Me?
2247880	2248700	Yeah.
2248700	2249860	38 on an 80. You all can.
2250860	2252340	Three.
2253620	2256980	Ooh, a seven. I pass with my little dinky score.
2256980	2259700	Joe and I just human-ed the shit out of Drew.
2259700	2260580	I lost my dice.
2260580	2261660	Those are pretty important
2261660	2263940	for what we're doing here today, Zach.
2263940	2264820	That's a crit fail.
2264820	2266140	Make some numbers up.
2266140	2268100	Yeah, if you just wanna say numbers, that's fine.
2268100	2269460	That's what we've been doing.
2269460	2274460	When I dropped my dice earlier, I couldn't find it, so.
2274900	2276780	I accidentally threw away my character sheet.
2276780	2277660	I've just been winging it.
2277660	2279220	That's a pass.
2280340	2281740	Okay, what did everyone roll?
2281740	2282900	38 on an 80.
2282900	2284500	Three on a 50.
2284500	2286340	Seven on a 30.
2286340	2288060	Yeah, it seems like he was stuck
2288060	2289900	between a rock and a hard place
2289900	2291900	and had to make a decision
2291900	2294800	and this is the call that he made.
2294800	2297060	How'd the pastor know about the money?
2297060	2300780	Well, he kinda tortured me.
2300780	2301620	What?
2301620	2302680	Drew.
2302680	2304260	When he says that, I kinda look him over.
2304260	2307220	Is there any visible torture on his body?
2307220	2309940	Drew lifts up his shirt.
2309940	2314940	There is a ring of blistered skin on his stomach,
2315780	2317420	on his round belly.
2317420	2318660	Oh, God, Drew.
2318660	2322740	There are scratch marks, cuts, and bite marks
2322740	2326220	all over the inside of this circle.
2326220	2327620	The pastor did this to you?
2328780	2329620	Well.
2329620	2332500	You do that thing where you heat up a container of rats
2332500	2335620	and they try to escape by clawing through your belly.
2335620	2337380	And Drew just pukes.
2337380	2340620	Something crosses his mind and he just like retches
2340620	2343620	and is like, ugh, ugh, ugh.
2343620	2345500	Vomit splashes on his feet.
2345500	2347220	John, can I get him out of these cuffs?
2347220	2349820	This is just sad.
2349820	2352180	I don't know if we should take him out of the cuffs.
2352180	2355020	I mean, I think we can keep him with us
2355020	2356500	and not fear for our safety,
2356500	2358220	but maybe we should keep him detained
2358220	2360860	until we know the full extent of the hold
2360860	2362460	this pastor has over him.
2362460	2363680	If we haven't patted him down,
2363680	2364980	it might be a good time to make sure
2365020	2366100	he doesn't have any kind of-
2366100	2367680	I get out of the passenger seat,
2367680	2370400	I go over and I hug Drew,
2370400	2373600	but then I pat him down after I give him a hug.
2373600	2378600	There is a small piece of cheap carpet in his pocket.
2380060	2383900	It is a little damp
2383900	2388900	and it's been rubbed on something that is like red
2389540	2392580	or like dark red.
2392580	2395460	Basically looks like a tiny piece of cheap carpet
2395460	2397820	that's been dipped in blood.
2397820	2398660	Drew-
2398660	2399500	But maybe not dipped,
2399500	2400460	but just like a little bit rubbed on it.
2400460	2403460	Drew, what is this?
2403460	2404780	It's nothing.
2404780	2405980	Drew, come on.
2405980	2407020	It's obviously something.
2407020	2409260	It's something that was in your pocket, it looks like.
2409260	2411520	It's a real strange item you got there.
2411520	2413820	No, it's just, I found it in the car.
2413820	2414780	In this car?
2414780	2415940	Drew.
2415940	2418140	Everybody roll human.
2418140	2419820	Everybody roll human.
2419820	2421260	72 on a 80.
2421260	2422500	43 on a 50.
2423460	2425020	He didn't find it in the car.
2425020	2427080	Drew, we know he didn't find this in no car.
2427080	2428660	Just tell us what it is.
2428660	2430300	You know we're just trying to help.
2430300	2431500	We're the good guys.
2431500	2432620	I don't, I-
2432620	2433860	Are you still a good guy, Drew?
2433860	2434940	I don't know if you are.
2434940	2437980	Do you remember what happened to the town of contention
2437980	2439740	while it was under your watch?
2439740	2441740	It was under your watch too, Drew.
2441740	2442660	Everyone.
2442660	2446300	People lost their animals, people lost their families.
2446300	2447700	Drew, you know as well as us
2447700	2449540	that we did everything we could.
2449540	2451580	We were working the case the whole time.
2451580	2453560	It's not like we abandoned anybody.
2453560	2456060	Didn't talk to anyone about anything.
2456060	2458760	Didn't let the public know what was going on.
2458760	2460580	Didn't respond to any calls.
2460580	2462860	Drew, we responded to every call we could.
2462860	2466020	Now you well know, working for the department yourself,
2466020	2467500	that we were ill-equipped
2467500	2469460	and had none of the resources we needed
2469460	2473260	to face a full-on reality-shattering catastrophe.
2473260	2475640	John, are you ill-equipped for everything
2475640	2478060	that you've ever come across in your life?
2478060	2480360	Drew, does this little carpet sample,
2480360	2482360	is this some kind of magic talisman
2482360	2484520	that the preacher's using to control you?
2484520	2485360	Yes.
2487440	2490960	Wow, that was a hell of a swing and a hit there, John.
2490960	2491800	Good work on that.
2491800	2493520	I'm fucking kidding.
2493520	2495760	It's not what it is, thank you very much.
2495760	2498480	You can just say something and then it's true.
2498480	2502760	Drew, you've never been sarcastic a day in your life.
2502760	2504280	Something's wrong with you.
2504280	2505880	Something in you is not you.
2505880	2507040	What's going on here?
2507040	2509560	I just don't understand why you guys don't believe me.
2510120	2513120	We believe that you were tortured and gave up the gun.
2513120	2513960	Okay.
2513960	2516080	We just, or not the gun, you know, the Adams.
2516080	2516920	Yeah.
2516920	2519260	Obviously that affected you.
2519260	2521360	Sorry about the whole rat thing.
2521360	2522240	Yeah.
2522240	2524320	Rat, yeah, that's rough.
2524320	2525720	So what have I done wrong?
2525720	2527840	Tell us what this is, where it came from.
2527840	2529440	We need you, yeah.
2529440	2531240	We need you to tell us what this is.
2535000	2539220	Okay, I'll show you.
2540560	2543560	Hand me the, just put it in my mouth.
2543560	2545200	And Drew opens up his mouth.
2545200	2547520	I look at the other officers.
2547520	2548680	What do you think, fellas?
2548680	2549520	I mean, he's cuffed still.
2549520	2552520	You're the one who's been real suspicious here.
2552520	2554280	Do you think it could be something
2554280	2555960	you could use against us in some way?
2555960	2558020	What are you gonna do if I do that?
2558020	2561840	You asked earlier, if telling you about this
2561840	2564120	will make us like be cool,
2564120	2565880	cause I don't know why you put me in handcuffs
2565880	2568080	all of a sudden, like I haven't done anything wrong.
2568100	2569360	So if this'll make us cool,
2569360	2570960	then I'll just tell you the truth about this.
2570960	2572480	I didn't wanna blow your minds or anything,
2572480	2574120	but just like you asked earlier
2574120	2576560	about how I knew where you were
2576560	2577900	and this is how I knew where you were.
2577900	2581480	So tell me like who you wanna know where they are
2581480	2582840	and like what they're doing or something
2582840	2584000	and put that in my mouth.
2584000	2586080	Okay, yeah, why don't you just tell us
2586080	2588200	the nature of this item?
2588200	2590600	I believe you, you don't have to demonstrate.
2590600	2591440	Why don't you tell us exactly.
2591440	2593640	If you believe me, then take me out of these handcuffs.
2593640	2594880	Thank you very much.
2594880	2598020	No, no, no, you gotta tell us what exactly it does
2598820	2599660	and how you came across it.
2599660	2600700	I put it in my throat and it chokes me out
2600700	2603260	until I almost die and I go unconscious a little bit
2603260	2606240	and I see where whoever I'm thinking about is.
2611700	2614900	Drew, I'm almost certain someone is playing a prank on you.
2614900	2618220	Keith gets excited, puts the carpet in his mouth
2618220	2619360	and says Tildy.
2623220	2624060	Holy shit.
2624060	2625120	You gotta shove it in there,
2625120	2627260	like making a dog take a pill.
2627260	2630780	Okay, describe it in detail.
2630780	2633280	This seems like something that someone should draw.
2635180	2638880	Mid-sentence, he just grabs Drew's mouth,
2638880	2643180	opens his mouth up, shoves the carpet in there,
2643180	2645380	closes his mouth and says Tildy B.
2652360	2653900	Drew?
2653900	2655340	Drew, you there?
2655340	2656540	Oh, I almost threw up.
2658260	2661120	Hold on, Clark, you gotta let him nearly die.
2663700	2666320	I'm looking at his eyes, though, is he conscious?
2666320	2668060	Is he aware of his surroundings and all that
2668060	2669500	as he's choking?
2669500	2670940	Yeah, he's just choking.
2670940	2673260	He's gotta pass out for the magic to happen.
2673260	2677460	He slowly gets on his hands and, well, no, he's handcuffed.
2677460	2679260	Is he handcuffed behind the back or in front?
2679260	2680380	I said behind earlier, yeah.
2680380	2683780	So he gets down on his knees and-
2683780	2684940	I'm kinda helping him down.
2684940	2687300	Okay, yeah, and then help him onto his side.
2687300	2688580	That's what he's trying to do.
2688580	2689420	That's what I do.
2689420	2691140	And he's just choking, choking, choking,
2691140	2694940	and then he's completely still.
2695820	2700180	And then this small, little violently red burst
2700180	2701420	shoots out of his mouth,
2701420	2704680	and the carpet only comes halfway out.
2704680	2706560	It's mostly just blood he spits out.
2706560	2708500	Carpet's hanging out of his mouth,
2708500	2711120	and he starts chewing on it a little bit.
2712080	2716960	Oh, God, oh, yeah, that is not wonderful.
2716960	2720720	If you could unhandcuff me, please, now that we're friends.
2722200	2726520	Tilly B. Mitchell is in a dark container.
2726520	2731080	It seems to be four walls made of some sort of material
2731080	2734120	that she cannot get out of,
2734120	2737040	and I couldn't really make out everything
2737040	2739000	that was her whole deal,
2739040	2743120	but she didn't seem to be tan.
2743120	2744800	It was very, very pale.
2747440	2749880	Cool, anybody else you guys wanna know?
2750760	2755760	No, no, please, please.
2755920	2758080	What's Jay Leno doing right now?
2758080	2761580	I just can't, I can't, did you see what-
2761580	2762920	Shove it in there, shove it in there.
2762920	2764840	Let's see what old Jay's up to.
2764840	2766280	I bet he's driving a car.
2766280	2771060	I need a sanity roll from Clark Bishop
2771060	2773640	and John Lee, Pettymore the Third.
2773640	2775280	I mean, you think we give a shit
2775280	2777560	about his little vision carpet?
2777560	2779000	I hope so, you like-
2779000	2780240	With everything we've seen at this point?
2780240	2783400	No, you're rolling sanity for making him choke
2783400	2785260	and basically torturing him.
2785260	2787400	He's crying on the ground right now.
2787400	2789280	I mean, Keith did that.
2789280	2790720	Plus, Drew told us it would happen.
2790720	2792060	It's not like it was unexpected.
2792060	2794760	So you're cool with just being like, yeah, that's fine.
2796400	2798440	No, apparently not because I rolled a 97.
2800520	2802500	John, this hits you deep.
2802500	2803560	This hits you so deep.
2803560	2805500	You feel like all at once you're like,
2805500	2807560	oh, I could have stopped Keith from doing that.
2807560	2809160	And we could have asked Drew
2809160	2811560	if we could have made it more comfy on him somehow
2811560	2813400	or at least gotten him out of cuffs
2813400	2817080	before we got him like choking violently on the ground,
2817080	2820900	gasping for air, unable to like see any future
2820900	2822640	for himself in that moment.
2822640	2825040	I do not regret keeping him cuffed
2825040	2828160	while we tested out the magical item
2828160	2829900	with only his word for what it did.
2829900	2831360	I think that's super fair.
2831360	2833080	Lose one sanity.
2833080	2834640	I failed my roll.
2834640	2836640	You're gonna lose one sanity as well.
2836640	2839420	That makes me hit my breaking point on the dot.
2839420	2842660	Okay, well, let's roll on the table, baby.
2842660	2845160	I'm gonna get Thomas and Luke out of here.
2845160	2846000	Bye.
2846000	2848960	So you're gonna roll a D100 three times
2848960	2851280	while I pull up the core rule book
2851280	2853720	for Call of Cthulhu seventh edition.
2856040	2858240	Got a 56,
2859800	2861200	a 98,
2862840	2864120	and an 89.
2864120	2865080	That's weird.
2865080	2867000	Also to calculate breaking point,
2867000	2869600	it's your sanity minus power.
2869600	2872200	Sanity minus power.
2872200	2873020	Correct.
2873020	2875720	So I've got a new breaking point of six.
2875720	2878000	One more mania to go.
2878760	2882800	All right, yeah, we're gonna do a mania on the first one
2882800	2885080	and a phobia on the second one.
2885080	2889640	How about, how about mania?
2890760	2894880	All righty, Joe, you rolled a 56,
2894880	2899000	which is ichthyomania.
2899000	2900300	Oh my God.
2900300	2901140	Is it fish?
2901140	2902840	It's an obsession with fish.
2902840	2903680	Yup.
2904680	2908400	Well, I think we got our winner right off the bat.
2908400	2909240	Pretty much.
2910240	2912400	Just to hit the other ones,
2912400	2917200	98 is typhlomania, which is pathological blindness.
2917200	2918040	Okay.
2918040	2921140	And then scribblomania, obsession with scribbling
2921140	2922960	or doodling, that would have been good for.
2922960	2924520	If we didn't have a fish thing in there,
2924520	2926960	we could have had that.
2926960	2930840	Yeah, so it's an obsession with fish.
2930840	2932320	The way that I should play this though,
2932320	2934680	is like when they are present, right?
2934680	2938040	Like I don't have to like seek out fish from now on, right?
2938040	2942220	I think maybe now and then you can seek out fish
2942220	2943860	if you would like to.
2943860	2947120	Maybe if Clark Bishop, oh, I brought them back too soon,
2947120	2950400	but otherwise you don't need, yeah.
2952920	2955600	When you guys rolled sanity,
2955600	2958840	Thomas rolled over his power, did Joe as well?
2958840	2963300	No, I did not, I rolled a 34 on an 18, on a 19.
2963300	2967440	Okay, so as Drew spits some more blood out of his mouth,
2967440	2969620	he's kind of like leaning up as Clark Bishop
2969620	2971340	is like helping him up.
2971340	2972900	I think maybe even losing the sanity,
2972900	2974660	like helping him up even quicker,
2974660	2976920	like, oh shit, what have I done kind of thing.
2976920	2981920	He's like, yeah, Tildy, yeah, Tildy is a dark room.
2983080	2985340	Does he still have the carpet like hanging out of his mouth?
2985340	2986180	Yeah.
2986180	2987000	I want to pull it out for him.
2987000	2987840	Thank you.
2987880	2989480	Who are you going to ask about?
2991320	2993560	Keith, I don't want to put him through that again.
2993560	2994560	That was awful.
2994560	2997240	That's a worst case scenario deal right there.
2997240	2999740	John is running off into the field
2999740	3002440	and it looks like he's trying to pull his own head off.
3003640	3005200	John.
3005200	3007160	You just hear him, like he's screaming
3007160	3008760	and it just starts like it's fading
3008760	3010160	a little bit in the distance.
3010160	3011980	Keith watches that for a couple of seconds
3011980	3013520	and then turns back to,
3013520	3018120	Drew, who else did the pastor make you look for?
3018120	3022180	Clark is maybe starting to head off toward John,
3022180	3023160	hollering after him.
3023160	3026720	You see John like trip over a golfer hole
3026720	3028800	or something out in the field
3028800	3032880	and he just like eats dirt and he slowly gets to his feet
3032880	3034500	and he kind of like, he looks back
3034500	3036460	and he shakes himself off.
3036460	3037920	You're all right over there?
3038960	3040780	Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.
3040780	3041620	I'm all right.
3041620	3045060	It's just a consequence of body swapping.
3045060	3047100	Sometimes, you know.
3047100	3049140	You gotta run, you gotta run it off.
3049140	3051860	The mind gets a little at odds with the body.
3051860	3053740	Kind of like why am I here, who am I,
3053740	3056020	you know, what's going on, what's.
3056020	3056980	I'd say I understand.
3056980	3058260	It's all good, it's all good, it's all good.
3058260	3061060	But if you're saying you're okay now, that sounds good.
3061060	3062620	You see his arms like twitch
3062620	3065860	and try to pull his head off like seemingly one more time.
3065860	3068860	Then he flops him around like spaghetti
3068860	3071360	and takes a big, big breath of air.
3072580	3076200	And he pats his legs and like dust himself off
3076200	3078780	and it starts walking back to the car.
3078780	3080380	As they're out in the field,
3080380	3085200	Keith asks who else the pastor wanted to look into.
3086380	3091380	Yeah, you know, thankfully I just did it a few times
3092920	3095520	just to find you.
3095520	3098940	Did you look for all of us or just one of us or what?
3098940	3100460	It was you mostly.
3100460	3101300	Me.
3101820	3104300	And as he says that,
3104300	3107220	you see a flurry of movement in the distance.
3107220	3108700	Far beyond John and Clark,
3108700	3112540	both walking back through the field, there's a barn
3112540	3116020	and a dark blur is whipping around from behind it,
3116020	3120220	energetically bounding hurriedly into the foreground.
3120220	3124220	Drew no longer sees any of you.
3124220	3129220	He is only gawking eagerly at this frenzied black lab
3129260	3131620	making its way toward you all.
3131620	3135260	His big ass gums flapping about in the brisk
3135260	3139720	December 6th wind, Drew cries out, Tyler!
3139720	3142100	Yeah, Clark is, Tyler!
3142100	3143940	Clark is really fucking excited.
3173940	3178940	How am I the only one trying to pull over?
3181780	3186780	How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?
3192700	3195200	If nobody knows, nobody knows.
