0	2200	my closest comrades.
2200	5100	Some of you may have noticed a strange occurrence
5100	6920	in the past couple weeks.
6920	10960	I, Wolf the Dog, your fearless leader,
10960	13640	have been held against my will for a time.
13640	16340	But I have escaped the torturous restraints
16340	19820	of Judge Ephraim Cortland's sloppy meat trees
19820	20920	he calls hands.
20920	24360	And I am now back triumphantly crawling
24360	27000	once again into your ear holes.
27000	31080	Here on 694.2 PTBP,
31080	35520	contention's oldest and only radio station.
35520	39240	Now that the true wolf is on the bone throne once again,
39240	42600	I think it's about damn time for some truth.
42600	44440	Fuck every billionaire.
44440	47080	Greed should only exist in the dumpster.
47080	51800	Mm, what's wet, stinky, and made for sharing?
51800	53960	It's the news.
53960	57600	No shit, that disgusting excuse of a human,
57600	60880	contention's so-called Judge Ephraim Cortland,
60880	63040	was keeping me locked up in a cell.
63040	66000	I'm deeply sorry to leave you so unsatisfied
66000	67880	for so long, my pups.
67880	71840	I promise to never get caught in a slop trap ever again.
71840	75080	Trapped me with slop bait once, shame on you.
75080	78520	Trapped me with slop bait twice, shame on you.
78520	80080	Trapped me with slop bait three times,
80080	81920	what the fuck is wrong with you?
81920	83760	It's clear I can't help myself.
83760	86400	And your crew would just take an advantage of that?
86400	87760	Jesus.
87760	91080	Anyway, maybe we should burn down the courthouse.
91080	94240	Silas Cole can host any trials or legal matters
94240	96160	out on his property by the mine.
96160	98840	And he may as well preside over them too.
98840	101920	He is, after all, the reason contention
101920	104480	is so very prosperous.
104480	107000	Slap your knee to the beat if you agree.
107000	109080	It's the Creek Rocks with
109080	111480	Can't You Hear the Wolves Are Howlin'?
111480	115600	["Can't You Hear the Wolves Are Howlin'?" plays in bright rhythm.]
141480	144480	["Can't You Hear the Wolves Are Howlin'?" plays in bright rhythm.]
171840	174920	Do you guys know where the word howdy comes from?
174920	175680	No.
175680	176520	No.
176520	177480	How do you do?
177480	178320	Yeah.
178320	179560	How do you do?
179560	180960	How did I not know that?
180960	182080	Howdy.
182080	185720	They shortened how do you do down to how do ye.
185720	186560	Howdy.
186560	188360	Which then became howdy.
188360	189200	Howdy.
189200	190080	Howdy.
190080	192400	How did I not know that?
192400	193240	Hey.
193240	194480	Ooh.
194480	195480	Got it.
195480	197440	I've got something that good for you here.
197440	202480	Why did the cowboy take hay to bed
202480	204840	to feed his nightmares?
204840	206080	Oh my God.
206080	206920	Mm.
206920	207760	Mm-hmm.
207760	208600	Mm-hmm.
208600	209720	Mm-hmm.
209720	210800	Got any others?
210800	212160	Yeah, you got any other good ones?
212160	213000	No, no more good.
213000	215440	No, no good ones, but I've got another one.
215440	216280	What did you Google?
216280	218680	It looks like he's really enjoying it.
218680	220800	I'm Googling cowboy jokes.
220800	222800	Am I frozen or something?
222800	225720	Yeah, you're frozen, but you're doing a cute little smile.
225720	227240	It's a very cute smile.
227240	228080	A hand behind the head.
228080	228920	Oh, another cute smile.
228920	230680	Very mischievous, Luke.
230680	234720	Oh my God, that one's even better.
234720	238680	What do you call a happy cowboy?
238680	241160	A jolly rancher.
241160	242000	Oh.
242000	244600	Got it.
244600	246360	Luke, have you delivered this joke before?
246360	248720	No, but I just was trying to think.
248720	250680	Luke's been sending him these all week.
252800	255880	Okay, my internet seems to be fucking up,
255880	260360	so let me try, okay, my hotspot is on,
260360	265360	but it's not showing up in my, oh, here we go.
265360	267320	Okay, I probably will disconnect for a second.
267320	268160	Bye.
268160	269000	Goodbye.
269000	270960	Quick, let's make all our Luke jokes right now.
270960	271920	Am I still here?
271920	272760	Fuck.
276200	278000	Okay, that worked.
278000	279000	You could have kicked Luke
279000	281800	and we could have had an all out Luke roast.
281800	283400	It's not a roast unless I'm here.
283400	284800	Yeah, you're yeah.
284800	285720	Yeah, you're yeah.
286400	288360	Did you see that Alec Baldwin roast
288360	290880	with like his daughter was doing it?
290880	292240	Yeah.
292240	294680	Yeah, pretty bad.
294680	297040	Yeah, it hit pretty hard.
297040	299160	That way Alec Baldwin got roasted by his daughter.
299160	301040	Yeah, like at a roast thing and the opening.
301040	302840	Oh my God, Luke's frozen in the exact same.
302840	305200	It's in spotting, it was just the smile.
305200	306360	That's insane.
307840	309240	Fuck.
309240	310080	Can you hear me?
310080	310920	Screenshot.
311760	316240	It's so cute.
316240	317200	What a cutie.
317200	318680	I hope he looks like that forever.
318680	320680	He will, have you seen his fucking dad?
320680	322480	Oh, that's so true.
324480	328040	Well, Efron fell off his damn old horse,
328040	331080	broke his big ass spine in twain.
331080	332240	I fucking wish.
332240	333560	Everett crawled inside him.
333560	335320	Oh, okay, let's go.
335320	336680	Okay, am I good?
336680	337680	You seem good.
337680	338520	Okay.
338520	339520	Yeah.
339520	341440	Can you put your arm behind your head
341440	343040	and smile for us really quick?
346920	350360	Silas Cole is on his knees with his hands behind his back
350360	354000	shackled by preacher-sheriff Dr. Bobby Custard
354000	358120	with Judge Ephraim Cortland standing right behind him,
358120	360480	right next to the preacher-sheriff doctor
360480	364840	watching as Jack Perlman, Professor Horace Green
364840	368720	and Everett Pace loaded the rug out of the back
368760	373760	of Silas Cole's wagon and then slowly unfurled the rug
374520	378040	after seeing shoes on one side and Everett, I believe,
378040	382120	reached in to the other side and felt some patchy hair,
382120	384800	a very thin-skinned scalp,
384800	387160	almost touching the skull right off the bat.
388080	392240	And as soon as the rug is completely unfurled,
392240	396680	hopping onto all four haunches, haunches?
399360	400680	Haunches.
400680	403120	You're on your own with this one.
403120	404920	Haunches.
404920	408040	Haunches are like, would be with your legs, right?
408040	411240	Hopping onto her back two haunches
411240	413800	with her human arms in front of her.
416000	418240	Are they touching the ground, the front arms?
419200	422920	No, she's in a two and a half point stance.
422920	424040	Velociraptor.
424040	428720	Which means she's got like one arm kind of halfway down.
428720	431640	The other one's on a knee, elbow on a knee.
431640	435480	You notice there are no fingernails on her hands
435480	437920	that are moving back and forth quickly
437920	439840	with these wild eyes.
439840	442320	She just slits right under them
442320	444520	from where her cheekbones are poking through
444520	448040	the thin skin on her face, blood dripping down
448040	452400	and she lets out a guttural scream.
453080	454680	Run, run, run, run.
455760	458760	And then we're gonna go ahead and roll
458760	460640	to see who she attacks.
460640	461960	Oh boy.
461960	465560	If it's a one or a two, she's gonna attack Jack Perlman.
465560	466400	No.
466400	468520	If it's a two or a three, she's gonna attack,
468520	471520	oh, three or four, she's gonna attack Everett Pace.
471520	472360	No.
472360	475520	Five or six, it's gonna be Professor Horse Green.
476480	478160	Hey Luke, can you roll a D6 for me
478160	479400	and tell me what you get?
480800	481640	Six.
481720	483760	Oh, that's gonna be Professor Horse Green
483760	486040	that she jumps directly toward.
486040	487920	You made him your executioner.
489920	492320	Hey Luke, do you wanna hurt one of your friends?
493720	494560	Sorry.
495760	499680	What does Professor Horse Green do as this human
499680	504680	wearing these unfathomably out of fashion clothes
505760	510760	with thin skin, open mouth, tongue waggling about,
511120	513240	jumping at you, arms first,
513240	516920	these fingernail-less hands going to grip
516920	519760	onto either side of your shoulders.
525360	528280	He shoots at her with his pistol.
529440	530280	And gets a,
531520	533160	And gets a what?
533160	534680	A hundred.
534680	535520	Oh no.
537320	539160	Oh my God.
539160	540000	What?
541080	541920	What?
543520	545240	Holy shit.
545240	546080	You nailed it.
548080	549800	Oh no.
549800	551720	What are the chances of that?
555520	557200	Holy shit.
557200	559960	Professor Horse Green, your sidearm
559960	563000	is still in the holster when you reach down to grab it,
563000	565800	pull it out, and you flick the trigger
565800	567120	right there on your holster.
567120	568480	Go ahead and roll damage.
568480	570120	What's the damage on that pistol?
571760	572600	Ah.
573640	576240	That's one D10 plus two.
576240	577640	Holy shit.
579240	580080	Nice.
582120	582960	Six.
582960	584400	Professor Horse Green,
585600	589160	your kneecap goes right into the dirt.
589160	593120	Bone shards from your knee are now sticking up
593120	597480	out of the dirt as blood just begins spurting
597520	601400	a fountain of blood away from your leg
601400	605680	out onto this dusty ground beneath you.
605680	607640	How many hit points did you have total?
609400	611760	I was at 11.
611760	614400	Yeah, so I'm going to need a constitution check there
614400	616800	to stay conscious, buddy.
616800	618000	Got a 50.
619240	621080	And I roll an 85.
621080	625240	Horse Green instantly collapses unconscious
625240	626800	as he bleeds out on the ground.
627040	628040	Oh shit.
628040	629040	Damn.
629040	630000	Holy shit.
636000	636840	What?
641280	643800	I might get to play video games a little bit earlier
643800	645000	than I thought tonight.
648640	650200	Oh my God.
650200	652000	He's been practicing with Red Dead,
652000	656040	but only using the bow and arrow.
656080	658160	Judge F from Courtland, it is your turn.
658160	659080	What do you do?
659080	662280	From what I'm seeing, I'm busy with Silas
662280	665520	and I just hear a scream and I turn around
665520	668600	and I see her like hunched over.
669760	672640	So I'm like within an arm's reach of my horse.
672640	675320	So I grabbed my lasso off the horse
675320	677280	and try to get her with the lasso,
677280	681320	like around her arms and try to demobilize her.
681320	682720	Roll rope use for me.
682720	683560	Okay.
684560	687080	That is a 85 on a 40.
687080	687920	Oof.
690440	691720	Oh no.
691720	694280	Well, this isn't going great so far.
694280	695840	Oh shit, my internet just went out.
695840	698360	Fuck, I wasn't recording either.
698360	699320	Damn it.
699320	700160	Oops.
700160	701600	Yeah, we're gonna have to do it again.
701600	705600	Yeah, we're gonna have to do all live from the get go.
705600	709240	So as I hear the scream, I turn around,
709240	713280	grab the lasso and throw the lasso,
713880	718120	but I had forgotten to tie the rope into a lasso.
718120	720520	So I just threw the end of a rope at her.
720520	723720	So the end of a rope hits her in the shoulder
723720	726640	and it's a heavy rope and she grabs on
726640	728160	to the other end of the rope.
730000	731800	Preacher Sheriff Bobby Custard.
735200	736040	Oh no.
739480	741280	Freezes in terror.
743320	745640	Just failed a sanity check.
745640	749040	A sanity check that I forgot to have all of you roll,
749040	752080	which you'll need to roll now.
752080	753400	I'm not conscious, baby.
753400	756440	You are unconscious, so you are good.
756440	758000	Oh, I rolled a crit fail.
759800	760640	Oh my God.
760640	761480	Did you really?
761480	762600	Welcome to the party, baby.
762600	763960	I rolled a 99.
763960	766120	Ooh, I got a 33 on a 50.
766120	767200	Crit success.
767200	768040	There you go.
768040	769360	Okay, I got a normal success.
769360	770960	And bringing the luck back up to our side.
770960	771800	Oh my God.
771880	774840	God damn these beautiful dice that Joe gave me.
776520	779480	Okay, Everett Pace, you lose no sanity.
779480	781640	Not sure how, not sure why.
781640	785560	It just looks like a scared battered woman in front of me.
785560	787840	She's just wild with fear.
787840	789960	And therefore you'd lose one sanity
789960	793280	because the success is still losing one sanity on this one.
793280	795120	That is my apologies.
795120	798240	She's real beat up though and that's not right.
798240	800120	It's definitely not right.
800120	803120	Judge Ephraim Courtland, you're going to lose zero sanity
803120	807280	with the full disregard that you have for all humans.
807280	811080	Yeah, I've seen countless people hanging by my own hand,
811080	813160	so really doesn't affect me too much.
813160	815040	Honestly, those smashed up watermelons
815040	816480	made me feel worse than this.
818320	821640	Glad I could add some horror for Judge Ephraim Courtland
821640	823840	in this short arc.
823840	827080	Jack Perlman, you're gonna lose a D4 plus one,
827080	828440	except for with a crit fail,
828440	831640	that D4 is automatically a four,
831640	834320	which means that you lose five sanity,
834320	837600	which just happens to be enough for you
837600	840880	to have a short bout of insanity.
840880	842880	Yay. Oh, lucky.
842880	844120	Yeah, that sounds fun.
844120	845240	Yeah, it's super fun.
845240	848640	So this is the thing where I'm gonna have you rank,
848640	853160	fight, flight, or freeze from most likely to least likely.
853160	856040	Fight, freeze, flight, most likely fight.
856080	858480	If you roll a one, you're gonna run away.
858480	860000	If you roll a two or a three,
860000	862360	you're gonna freeze for one round,
862360	865640	and if you roll four, five, six,
865640	867720	you will immediately fight,
868880	873240	which would just be fine in this situation, seemingly.
873240	874800	That'll be a freeze.
874800	875640	Perfect.
875640	877640	So Jack Perlman, on your turn,
877640	879680	Me and Bobby, doin' the Lord's work.
879680	882560	You're gonna do what future Sheriff Dr. Bobby Custard
882560	884160	is doing, which is...
884200	889200	Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.
890800	893480	Everett Pace, it is your turn.
893480	895040	Judge Courtland threw the lasso.
895040	897440	She grabbed onto it, so she's still holding it onto her end,
897440	899080	and he's holding onto his end, right?
899080	900080	That is correct, yes.
900080	902320	I wanna grab the rope anywhere that I can
902320	904360	to pull as hard as I can,
904360	906840	the purpose being to have her fall on her face.
906840	907680	Sounds good.
907680	909840	You roll, I'll roll.
909840	913120	Everett, you just roll strength.
913120	913960	Will do.
917240	919920	I pass a 23 on a 50.
919920	921960	I pass with a 46.
921960	923520	Fuck.
923520	924800	How does that...
924800	927920	That is an interesting question, Everett Pace.
927920	930040	Can we just be in a stalemate on the tug?
932440	934960	You know what, yeah, since we both passed,
936640	939360	the rope goes completely taut,
939360	942760	and she's looking directly at you
942760	946320	with these wild, wild eyes.
946320	948160	Roll psychology.
948160	949880	Son, I ain't got none of that.
951040	952800	A 96 on a 10.
954800	956720	I got natural world out the wazoo.
956720	957680	Would that help me?
957680	959200	Yeah, go ahead and roll that.
961360	964160	I pass that a 53 on an 80.
964160	965840	You've seen a feral possum.
967520	968360	Yeah, for sure.
968360	972680	These eyes, this sick combination of fear,
972680	977040	loathing, and pure rage of needing to survive.
977040	978360	And Las Vegas.
980120	983800	Has only ever been seen in modern day in Las Vegas,
983800	988160	and in the eyes of feral possums,
988160	990760	and I'm sure other things.
992320	993960	Feral mongese.
993960	995320	No, those are cute no matter what.
995320	996160	Oh, I'm sorry.
996160	997000	And with that...
997080	998200	Feral skunks.
999560	1000720	It's Jack Perlmanster.
1001920	1004920	Oh, I get to do something. Feral spirits.
1004920	1007440	No, I just want you to tell me...
1007440	1008600	How scared I am.
1008600	1009720	Will Ferrell? Yeah, just talk to me
1009720	1012720	about what's happening in your brain.
1012720	1015440	So inside of Jack's brain,
1015440	1018600	he's been beaten down just sanity-wise
1018600	1021280	over and over and over again from the get-go,
1021280	1025080	because I think I failed every sanity roll this time.
1026080	1028040	But he's just hit the breaking point
1028040	1030520	where it's like the rubber band of stress
1030520	1033480	has been stretched too much, and it snapped.
1033480	1036120	And when it snapped, he just, he can't do anything.
1036120	1037840	He doesn't know how to put it back together
1037840	1040680	and do something that's useful right now.
1040680	1041960	Paralyzed.
1041960	1044280	I'm paralyzed with fear, baby.
1044280	1045320	He says to Everett.
1049640	1050880	Hey, Everett, I can't move.
1050880	1052920	I'm too scared right now.
1052920	1055320	And as those thoughts are going through your brain,
1055320	1056960	out of the corner of your eye,
1056960	1061880	you see Tilde be this crazed teenage girl
1061880	1066160	in a complete bout of madness in her own right,
1066160	1070560	drops the rope and lunges directly at your neck.
1072280	1076280	Unable to respond, she doesn't even try to pin you.
1076280	1080480	She just like, mouth first, goes straight to your neck.
1080480	1082280	She misses the jugular.
1082280	1085560	She goes around the side, almost behind your ear,
1085560	1087120	and bites down.
1087120	1088880	You're gonna lose four damage.
1090680	1095680	As she bites down to where her teeth, top and bottom,
1095760	1099640	touch, and then she rips her head back.
1099640	1102120	Blood begins pouring down,
1102120	1106840	and you feel the shirt on your back become wet
1106840	1111360	with thick, hot Jack Pearlman blood juice.
1112600	1113600	That's yucky.
1113600	1116960	And she begins chewing.
1118760	1120940	Judge, Courtland, it is your turn.
1122280	1125120	So the rope gets let go of
1125120	1127760	and kind of, you know, loses all of the tension.
1127760	1131280	And the opium is really starting to hit the judge right now
1131280	1133720	combined with all the whiskey he's drank.
1133720	1135120	So he- I forgot about that.
1135120	1137200	He starts to nod off a little bit
1137200	1141920	and then wakes up and just starts to coil the rope
1142560	1145160	back and then takes a swig of whiskey
1145160	1148120	and just lackadaisically starts tying it
1148120	1150160	into an actual lasso.
1150160	1151000	Okay.
1151000	1153720	Unaware of what's happening to Jack.
1153720	1155960	Yeah, completely unaware.
1155960	1158360	Horace Green is now on the ground.
1158360	1160880	Jack Pearlman is standing there
1160880	1163600	with part of his shoulder neck.
1163600	1167200	His traps are missing on one side a little bit.
1167200	1169780	And blood gushing down his shirt.
1169820	1173220	Judge Ephraim Courtland staring off into the distance,
1173220	1176500	coiling up his lasso and ever at pace,
1176500	1180180	holding on to the other end of that there rope.
1180180	1184900	Silas Cole stands up from his position, still handcuffed,
1184900	1189900	and begins making his way toward the front door of the house
1190260	1192820	and he gets up onto the porch
1192820	1197820	before it is Bobby Custard's turn, who immediately turns.
1198220	1203220	Okay, now Silas, something crazy's going on here and...
1203540	1207380	And with that notices, Tildy B takes his attention
1207380	1212380	off of Silas and is going to fire at Tildy B. Mitchell.
1212820	1216740	Strikes true with eight damage.
1216740	1217820	Nice.
1217820	1218660	Yeah.
1218660	1222540	Fires three rounds into Tildy B. Mitchell's chest,
1222540	1227340	who staggers backwards and lets out another.
1227340	1228180	Ahhh!
1233580	1234980	Fuck.
1234980	1237940	Three bullet holes in her.
1237940	1241940	Blood begins pouring down her shirt
1241940	1245120	that is clearly the cut of another time.
1245120	1248460	I don't know how many different ways I can say that.
1248460	1250880	Some kind of future cloth.
1250880	1252780	What is Forever 21?
1257660	1260000	Everett Pace, it's your turn.
1261460	1264260	I wanna take some of the watermelon out of my pocket
1264260	1266700	and throw it toward her feet.
1266700	1269460	I'm trying to bait her, so I'm saying things like,
1269460	1271180	here, here, you hungry, you hungry?
1271180	1273540	Here, here, take some of this, take some of this.
1273540	1276160	And I'm just chucking watermelon out of my pockets
1276160	1277000	onto the ground in front of her.
1277000	1281140	I thought you were going for like a banana peel effect.
1281140	1283600	Either way, either way, I'll take either way.
1285540	1286380	Boy, howdy.
1286380	1289620	Okay, I bet you don't have charm.
1289620	1291220	So let's have you roll.
1292620	1295780	Even though Everett charms all of our hearts,
1295780	1297820	every week on PTBP.
1298740	1302540	I've got farming and this is a pretty classic farming skill.
1302540	1305740	You gotta throw watermelon at the ground sometimes.
1305740	1310740	For fertilizer to get the chickens back into the coop.
1310740	1313060	And if you run into a feral possum,
1313060	1315980	it's handy to have some watermelon in your pocket
1316540	1318140	to feed it to get its attention away from you
1318140	1318980	while you get away.
1318980	1322060	Yeah, so give him like a plus 20 on that roll, Zach.
1322060	1324260	You could just do that for us real quick.
1328680	1331340	Okay, roll farming.
1331340	1332220	Are you, okay.
1333780	1334620	I pass.
1337180	1339300	It's a 41 out of 60.
1339300	1344300	This watermelon goo in the most appetizing way
1345300	1347400	you possibly could have.
1348700	1350500	Michelin star.
1350500	1353140	For an animal, oh my God.
1353140	1356180	This watermelon goop is so well plated
1356180	1358900	on this dusty, dusty ground.
1358900	1360700	As if I was planting it.
1360700	1363460	That's how well it's landed in this ground.
1364740	1366180	Jesus.
1366180	1367820	Yeah, no matter what happens,
1367820	1369700	whether I remember to or not,
1369700	1374540	the epilogue of this story is the growth
1374540	1376300	of watermelons next year.
1377980	1380980	Hey, I wanna throw that watermelon on the ground
1380980	1382280	and start getting out of there.
1382280	1383260	It's a distraction.
1383260	1385180	So I'm walking back toward the horses.
1385180	1389380	Can our next arc be like going inside one of the characters
1389380	1391340	cause he swallowed a watermelon seed
1391340	1394060	and it's gonna grow inside of him.
1394060	1395420	We gotta get it out.
1395420	1397180	Are you playing the watermelon seed?
1397180	1398020	Sure.
1398020	1398840	Yes.
1398880	1399880	Watermelon seeds.
1399880	1401400	We're food in the next arc.
1403120	1404480	Everett, go ahead and roll.
1404480	1406000	Are you trying to sneak away
1406000	1409200	or are you just kind of walking?
1409200	1410080	Just kind of walking,
1410080	1411840	hoping that I distracted her enough
1411840	1413960	that her attention is not on me.
1413960	1414780	Okay.
1414780	1415620	But I don't have stealth.
1415620	1417700	I mean, that's just not something I can do.
1417700	1418960	Yeah, no, you can walk away.
1418960	1419800	That's fine.
1419800	1422200	There wasn't a lot to hide behind anyway.
1422200	1423260	No big rocks.
1424200	1426680	I mean, if you're on stealth, big rock appear.
1427680	1429840	You roll stealth, big rock appear.
1429840	1431800	Jack Promo, what are you up to?
1431800	1435120	Oh, you know, slowly dying probably.
1435120	1436520	That's what it feels like
1436520	1439560	as I put my hand over what used to be
1439560	1441040	part of my neck and shoulder.
1441040	1443040	And now I assume it's like a donut.
1443040	1445680	Like when you take just a single or like a bagel
1445680	1447920	and it's that perfectly round bite,
1447920	1452320	but just out of the chunk of my well-toned shoulders.
1452320	1453320	Oh, Jack.
1453320	1457320	You ever fall in love with your own character?
1457320	1460320	Yep, that's exactly why.
1462160	1465920	Roll to, I want to roll to kiss Jack Pearlman.
1465920	1467020	Justin does.
1468120	1470120	Oh, I crit failed again.
1470120	1473120	Am I like kind of shocked back into reality
1473120	1474560	with the bite I'm assuming?
1474560	1475400	I'm like, whoa.
1475400	1476220	Yeah.
1476220	1477840	You were in slow-mo before.
1477840	1482840	And then as soon as she rips the muscle up out of your neck,
1483800	1487280	everything fast-forwards back in place.
1487280	1488540	Back to reality.
1488540	1489640	Back to reality.
1489640	1492600	I want to like try and,
1492600	1495960	is she like real fast and kind of like spindly and wiry?
1495960	1497640	Yeah, she's not giving up that easy.
1497640	1498960	I would like to like,
1498960	1501400	can I like grapple her to the ground almost
1501400	1503920	and like hold her down on the ground?
1503920	1505440	You can certainly try to do that, yeah.
1505440	1506260	Okay.
1506260	1507100	Shove her face in that watermelon.
1507100	1509600	I have fighting brawl or strength, I don't know.
1509600	1511740	Fighting brawl would be the one
1511780	1513300	that I would like you to roll against me on.
1513300	1514140	Okey-dokey.
1514140	1515820	And yeah, I basically want to just like
1515820	1518600	grapple her to the ground and kind of like hold on to her,
1518600	1521580	but in a position where I cannot be bit, like.
1521580	1522540	Yes.
1522540	1525100	She succeeded with an off four.
1525100	1527140	I got a 10.
1527140	1528220	Yeah.
1528220	1529360	Yeah, that'll do.
1529360	1530860	With a success.
1530860	1531700	Hell yeah.
1531700	1532520	That'll do.
1532520	1535900	So for a pin, no damage will be dealt to her,
1535900	1538580	but you are now pinning her,
1538580	1542100	which gives her a negative and you a positive
1542100	1545580	on your next rolls and her a negative on any opposing rolls.
1545580	1546420	Okay.
1546420	1547260	You're moving forward.
1547260	1549500	However, as you have her pinned to the ground,
1549500	1551020	you look around you.
1551020	1552200	Right next to you on the ground,
1552200	1553860	you see Professor Horace Green,
1553860	1556300	who just lost another hit point this round.
1556300	1557780	Oh no.
1557780	1559140	Four.
1559140	1560340	Oh shit.
1560340	1561380	Damn.
1561380	1564300	Everett Pace, who is slowly backing away
1564300	1566140	from the entire situation.
1566140	1570740	Silas Cole, who is on the porch of the house,
1570740	1573540	heading into his home, hopefully.
1573540	1575960	Preacher Sheriff Bobby Custard,
1575960	1578520	who is gun drawn looking around.
1578520	1580320	So he seems to be a good ally here.
1580320	1581460	And Judge Ephraim Courtland,
1581460	1584260	who seems to not care so much about all this,
1584260	1586140	care far more about getting his rope
1586140	1589540	back into its upright position.
1589540	1592820	Y'all better get on over here and help me out now.
1592820	1593640	Everett.
1594160	1597240	He's walking away from me.
1597240	1598840	It's Tildy B. Mitchell's turn again
1598840	1600880	and I'm gonna go pee real quick.
1600880	1603640	Hey, I do wanna bring up for Horace's sake
1603640	1606680	that opium is a natural painkiller,
1606680	1608940	so if that can help in any way.
1608940	1610280	And he smoked some of it.
1613280	1614680	Yeah, no, he can't feel it.
1616720	1617560	You like that?
1617560	1618600	Good, good.
1618600	1620240	He can't feel that he's dying.
1621240	1625160	Can't believe I rolled a 99 and then a 10 on these guys.
1625160	1626400	High and low.
1626400	1627800	Thank God he hit that 10, though.
1627800	1629640	That gives us a moment.
1629640	1631960	I would have probably died, I think.
1631960	1634120	What happened to Horace Green?
1634120	1635700	That's when the dogs were getting here,
1635700	1636880	so I couldn't hear.
1636880	1638120	He shot his knee off.
1638120	1642440	He crit failed a gunshot.
1642440	1644320	Oh, no.
1644320	1647360	Did she attack you first and then you did it?
1647360	1649680	He said that she was going to attack him,
1649960	1651360	so he preemptively shot.
1651360	1653600	Yeah, I tried to shoot at her and just blew my knee off.
1653600	1655400	Oh, my God.
1655400	1657480	I thought she'd like crit attacked you
1657480	1659300	or something like that in success.
1659300	1660320	That's crazy.
1660320	1661600	Good old crit fail.
1661600	1662560	Always fun.
1662560	1663720	It was a hundred, too.
1663720	1665120	It was the crittest of fails.
1665120	1668320	I saw the roll, but I didn't see what led up
1668320	1669760	or what happened because of it.
1669760	1670600	Oh, right.
1670600	1671600	That's fucking wild.
1672600	1673700	Wanna hear a joke?
1673700	1674680	Yeah, go for it.
1675640	1678800	Okay, a big Texan cowboy stopped at a local restaurant
1678800	1682080	following a day of drinking and roaming around in Mexico.
1682080	1683260	While sipping his tequila,
1683260	1685680	he noticed a sizzling scrumptious looking platter
1685680	1687360	being served at the next table.
1687360	1690320	Not only did it look good, but the smell was wonderful.
1690320	1692720	He asked the waiter, what is that you just served?
1692720	1695040	The waiter replied, ah, you have excellent taste.
1695040	1697520	Those are bull testicles from the bullfight this morning.
1697520	1698840	Delicacy.
1698840	1700960	The cowboy undaunted said, what the heck?
1700960	1701780	I'm on vacation.
1701780	1702620	I'll have some.
1702620	1704640	The waiter replied, I'm so sorry.
1704640	1706280	There's only one serving per day
1706280	1708600	because there's only one bullfight each morning.
1709240	1710080	If you place your order now,
1710080	1712840	we'll be sure to save you the delicacy for tomorrow.
1712840	1714740	The cowboy placed the order and the next evening,
1714740	1717520	he was served the one and only special delicacy of the day.
1717520	1719860	After a few bites and inspecting the contents
1719860	1722180	of his platter, he called to the waiter and said,
1722180	1724760	these are delicious, but they're quite a bit smaller
1724760	1727080	than the ones I saw you serve yesterday.
1727080	1729000	The waiter shrugged his shoulders and replied,
1729000	1730620	sometimes the bull wins.
1732040	1733280	Nice.
1733280	1734120	It's a good one.
1734120	1736040	So it was like he ate the person's balls.
1736040	1738440	He ate the matador's balls.
1739260	1740100	Nice.
1740100	1741400	If only he'd been there a day earlier,
1741400	1743680	he could have gotten the bull's testicles that he wanted.
1743680	1746440	Yeah, that's actually more of a dramatic tale
1746440	1747280	that you told us.
1747280	1750400	A cowboy asked me if I could help him round up 18 cows.
1750400	1752540	I said, sure, that's 20 cows.
1759540	1760600	I like it.
1760600	1765600	Jack Perlman, roll, brawling, fight again for me.
1765600	1770600	What if I don't want to tell you what I rolled
1771280	1773080	because it's 61 on a 60.
1774080	1779080	Oh, and with the success from this unnatural teenager,
1779560	1784560	Jack Perlman is thrown at least four feet in the air
1784940	1788480	and he lands on his back.
1788480	1791860	You'll take no damage from this, but.
1791860	1794960	It's scary, but don't make me roll a sanity, please.
1795600	1799520	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1799520	1800360	Roll sanity.
1800360	1801180	Okay.
1804640	1805480	Fail.
1805480	1806960	Oh, God damn it.
1808960	1812280	I've lost nine sanity so far in these episodes.
1812280	1815600	Lose one more as you're staring up at the sky,
1815600	1819640	you think about, was Perlman a religious man?
1819640	1820840	No.
1820840	1821660	He is now.
1823000	1824280	Should have been praying.
1826440	1827360	Oh my God.
1827360	1829080	Judge F from Courtland, it's your turn.
1829080	1832640	After the judge gets his rope coiled up,
1832640	1837440	he notices that Silas is not on the ground by him anymore
1837440	1839640	and catches him out of the corner of his eye
1839640	1843260	and sees him running off towards his house.
1843260	1844520	And he's going to drop the rope
1844520	1847360	and just chase after Silas.
1847360	1848200	Okay.
1848200	1850280	And if I can get to him, I want to grab him.
1850280	1854680	Let's go ahead and have you roll.
1854680	1856280	Character sheet here.
1856280	1859000	Climb for climbing stairs.
1860340	1863760	Drive wagon coach, which is what everybody in town
1863760	1865360	calls your fat ass.
1872120	1873960	I'm not seeing anything.
1873960	1875920	So I'll have your old dexterity.
1875920	1876760	Okay.
1879720	1881800	29 on a 60.
1881800	1883280	Nice.
1883280	1884120	39.
1884320	1885160	Fuck.
1885160	1886000	Damn.
1886000	1887240	Gotcha, baby.
1887240	1888080	It makes sense.
1888080	1891280	Judge F from Courtland's this big lumbering creature,
1891280	1894340	almost as horrifying as Tildy B. Mitchell.
1894340	1897900	And he makes it right up onto the stairs
1897900	1902900	as Silas Cole slams the door directly in his face.
1904040	1905920	Ephraim stops at the stairs
1905920	1908240	and just kind of like blinks hard and looks
1908240	1911440	and takes another swig of his whiskey.
1911440	1916280	Preacher Sheriff, Dr. Bobby Custard is going to...
1916280	1917320	Save us all.
1917320	1921380	Actually, let's see who's going to roll this for me.
1921380	1923200	Joe, you can roll it.
1923200	1925480	Roll a D six.
1925480	1927640	If you roll a one, two or three,
1927640	1929440	he's going to shoot Tildy B. Mitchell.
1929440	1930800	If you roll four, five or six,
1930800	1932720	he's going to start giving first aid
1932720	1934220	to Professor Horse Green.
1935320	1936340	It's a four.
1936340	1937320	Right next to his bag,
1937320	1942320	he grabs his medicine bag out of his side saddle there,
1943080	1944540	part of his tack.
1944540	1945380	Nice.
1946520	1947600	Maybe, I don't know.
1950040	1952760	And he rushes to Horse Green
1952760	1957340	and begins successfully doing first aid.
1958280	1962640	Horse Green, conscious again, you gain three hit points.
1963520	1964360	Hello.
1967480	1971160	His eyes open and he says, hello.
1971160	1973000	I don't feel a thing.
1973000	1975240	Now his eyes open and he says,
1975240	1976080	Ah!
1977360	1978200	Ah!
1980460	1981300	Ah!
1984440	1985260	Help me!
1985260	1987640	And your face, it's your turn.
1987640	1989920	So she's devouring this watermelon
1989920	1993800	and she's just all about the watermelon right now, right?
1994760	1997720	Like it's probably her favorite thing right now, right?
1997720	1999520	She might be looking at the watermelon.
1999520	2000920	She's scrambling over toward it.
2000920	2002600	She thinks it's part of Jack still.
2002600	2005240	Her socks have little watermelon slices on them,
2005240	2006420	so you know she's a fan.
2006420	2010040	And he's trying to get to Sheriff Bobby Custard's horse
2010040	2012640	to grab the rifle out of the side saddle there.
2012640	2013460	Smart.
2013460	2016640	Can I get there in time and shoot or do I just get there?
2016640	2018040	No, you can get there and shoot.
2018040	2022000	I'd like to shoot at Tildy B, at the scary zombie lady.
2022000	2023480	Yeah, you don't know her name.
2024000	2024840	And she screams,
2024840	2025680	Ah!
2025680	2026520	Ah!
2026520	2028680	My name is Tildy B Bitcha!
2030360	2032440	So now we can all start calling her that.
2037160	2038460	Oh my God.
2040360	2041540	Oh, I can push.
2041540	2042840	So I rolled a 77.
2042840	2045520	That would be a crit fail on a 70.
2045520	2046800	I'm gonna push this roll.
2046800	2048200	I forgot about pushing.
2048200	2049620	Hey, you know what?
2049620	2051040	You can't push.
2051040	2052400	Oh, a fucking crit.
2052400	2053800	God damn it.
2053800	2054760	Oh, cool, okay.
2054760	2056820	God damn it.
2057840	2058680	Okay.
2058680	2059520	What?
2059520	2061280	Our dice are cursed tonight.
2061280	2062380	Fuck.
2062380	2063220	All right, yeah.
2063220	2064040	That was a crit fail with a...
2064040	2064880	Roll damage for me.
2064880	2066380	Yeah, okay.
2066380	2068560	That's a D10 plus four.
2068560	2069600	Ooh.
2069600	2071540	Four, so eight total.
2071540	2072720	Eight total?
2072720	2073560	Yeah.
2077440	2080280	Preach your sheriff, Dr. Bobby Custard, let's out a
2080280	2083160	Ew, oh, fucking shit!
2086160	2087840	Oh my gosh.
2087840	2089000	Oh, damn it.
2090700	2091960	With his own gun.
2093660	2096240	Professor Horace Green, the first thing you see actually
2096240	2098320	when you open your eyes and start screaming
2098320	2100860	once you've come back to reality a little bit,
2101800	2106800	the front of Preacher Sheriff, Dr. Bobby Custard's torso,
2107200	2111520	just on his left side, explodes through
2111520	2116080	and viscera and awful just starts kind of pouring out
2116080	2116920	the front of him.
2116920	2118480	My bad, my bad.
2118480	2121080	It's like you threw a crispy.
2121080	2123800	I criss-succeeded on my constitution check.
2123800	2126960	Hell yeah, so he instantly heals and we're all good.
2126960	2127920	Let's just keep going.
2127920	2128920	Whose turn is it now?
2131400	2134720	It is Jack Pearlman's turn as Preacher Sheriff,
2134720	2139440	Dr. Bobby Custard grabs almost the entire thing of gauze
2139440	2143560	in his pack and shoves it like a fistful
2143560	2146200	just right into his own gut.
2148120	2150880	Jack Pearlman gets his knife out.
2150880	2152600	He's going for blood.
2152600	2156200	He's going to stab Tildibee or swipe at her,
2156200	2158800	whatever, whatever works, whatever you think works.
2158800	2159960	Stab, swipe.
2159960	2161080	Stab, swipe.
2161080	2162360	So you're gonna roll.
2162360	2165480	I believe it's fighting brawl.
2165480	2168440	Unless you have a knife skill that's different than that.
2168440	2170680	The knife is brawl skill.
2170680	2171520	Oh, that's cool.
2171520	2173960	Well, I failed, so 72 on a 60.
2173960	2177400	She did too, so she won't be able to use your knife
2177400	2179080	against you in any way, but you're just.
2179080	2180920	Oh, it's good to know that's up for.
2182400	2183240	Oh, always.
2185600	2187800	She takes a negative if she's already gone this round,
2187800	2188720	that's just kind of how it works.
2188720	2190640	If she was to fight against one of you guys
2190640	2191520	and you could fight back,
2191520	2192800	you'd take a negative that round as well.
2192800	2194520	So I could push though if I wanted to
2194520	2195920	since I didn't crit fail.
2197480	2198920	Yes.
2198920	2200960	But then if I do fail, I crit fail.
2200960	2203280	Yeah, that is correct. I'm going for it.
2203280	2204800	Hell yeah, don't stab yourself.
2204800	2207680	I can't roll this bad this many times.
2207680	2209400	Right guys, right?
2209400	2211080	Famous last words.
2211080	2215560	Okay, so you swing wildly as she, Neo from the Matrix,
2215560	2219400	like bends back, dodging all of your side swipes.
2219400	2221000	What are you doing to try to?
2221400	2224400	So I like to imagine he has it where it's like down,
2224400	2226760	like he's holding it and it's going down
2226760	2228320	and he's swiping like that.
2228320	2229960	And then as he misses one of his swipes,
2229960	2233160	he's going to go for like jamming it into her instead.
2233160	2234280	The American plunge.
2234280	2235120	Yes.
2236560	2237880	Well, yeah.
2237880	2239960	She succeeds with a 20.
2239960	2241480	I fail with a 91.
2242480	2246600	Oh no, what is your damage on that knife, sir?
2246600	2249440	A D4 plus two plus a D4.
2249480	2251160	So two D4 plus two.
2251160	2253000	What kind of knife was that?
2253000	2254840	Cause he has a damage bonus.
2254840	2255680	The knife has a damage bonus.
2255680	2258640	I'm very strong, so when I stab myself,
2258640	2261000	it's going to hurt really bad.
2261000	2262760	All right, do you want to roll one D4
2262760	2265560	and I'll roll the other one or do you want?
2265560	2267320	We're connected through our dice.
2268200	2269040	I rolled a two.
2269040	2271760	I rolled a one, oh, thank God.
2271760	2272600	So five?
2272600	2273440	Yeah, five.
2273440	2274480	That's still not great.
2274480	2275880	How many hit points did you have?
2275880	2278840	I had 10 and now I have five.
2279160	2280000	What did you start with?
2280000	2280840	14.
2280840	2281920	Holy shit, okay.
2281920	2283520	You had 10, now you have five.
2283520	2287560	Taking half of your current hit points in one round.
2287560	2289760	I'm going to need a constitution check for you,
2289760	2292360	Jack Perlman, and you've been doing nothing
2292360	2294120	but rolling great this entire time.
2294120	2296840	So I'm sure you'll have no issues staying conscious.
2296840	2298560	I'm gonna use one of these metal babies.
2298560	2299400	Joe.
2299400	2300720	Metal baby.
2300720	2303200	I can't believe you fucked me like this, Joe.
2303240	2304080	Oops.
2308000	2308840	Wait a minute.
2308840	2309680	No.
2309680	2310520	A 10.
2310520	2315440	Can I only roll the worst ever or super low?
2315440	2316280	Wait, what did you tell me to roll?
2316280	2317120	No, that's great.
2317120	2318640	You're still good.
2318640	2321160	I was confused on what I asked you to roll.
2321160	2322440	So you can stay conscious.
2322440	2325760	That was a constitution check in order to stay conscious.
2325760	2329640	However, your knife is directly in between
2329640	2332280	the two bones in your femur.
2332320	2334280	Nope, femur's one bone.
2334280	2335120	Tibia and fibula.
2335120	2336120	What's the bone right next to the femur?
2336120	2337160	PP bone.
2337160	2338000	It's in your PP bone.
2338000	2339160	I stabbed my PP.
2339160	2341160	Tibia and fibula.
2341160	2342000	Is that your thigh?
2342000	2343440	That might be in your arm.
2343440	2344360	No, that's your leg.
2344360	2345720	It's the lower calf.
2345720	2346720	Lower part of the leg.
2346720	2347720	I broke them bad boys.
2347720	2349440	I don't know shit about no bones.
2349440	2350360	It's in my leg.
2350360	2353080	It's in your leg and it is scratching
2353080	2355640	up against your femur.
2355640	2360040	You think that if you were to pull out your femur bone
2360040	2364080	and look at it, it would have Tildi B's initials on it.
2365680	2367120	It's completely dug in there.
2367120	2369640	And she helped guide it away from her
2369640	2372240	and right back directly into your leg.
2372240	2374520	And it is stuck there.
2374520	2377480	How could she do that chewing on watermelon?
2377480	2378520	She's a great multitasker.
2378520	2381040	Yeah, you forgot to give me my plus 40 bonus.
2381040	2384920	So from watermelon distraction.
2384920	2386680	Professor Horace Green, it's been a while.
2386680	2387640	Indeed.
2387640	2389600	Am I still losing hit points?
2389600	2390480	No longer, no.
2390480	2393840	You've been stabilized by the good preacher sheriff doctor.
2393840	2394680	Oh, good.
2394680	2396560	I'd like to shoot Tildi B.
2396560	2397840	Yes, that does make sense.
2397840	2399640	If you'd like to roll firearms.
2403640	2406120	Oh, no.
2406120	2408200	It's not a crit fail, but a 95.
2408200	2411360	I'll push it, push it real good.
2411360	2412200	Fuck it.
2412200	2413040	Yeah, I'll push it.
2420200	2421640	Oh, no.
2421640	2423960	What's a crit fail if you fail a push, right?
2423960	2424800	Yeah.
2424800	2426240	Yeah, I failed.
2426240	2427880	Oh, boy.
2427880	2432880	Horace, yeah, Horace blind with pain tries to shoot again.
2437080	2439080	And what does he do, Zach?
2439080	2441440	Well, guess who's right above him.
2441440	2442280	Oh, no.
2442280	2445080	Who just got shot himself with his own rifle.
2445080	2447360	Who is just giving you first aid.
2447360	2451560	Who's right in between you and Tildi B. Mitchell.
2451560	2452920	Bubby.
2452920	2455800	Right before you can aim your gun down
2455800	2459680	to point at the unnatural creature tearing apart
2459680	2462320	Jack Pearlman with his own turns,
2462320	2465320	you fire the pistol on its way down.
2465320	2466800	Go ahead and roll damage for me.
2473800	2474320	Oh, boy.
2474320	2477000	Was it max damage?
2477000	2477920	It's 11.
2477920	2480520	Oh, my god.
2480520	2481960	I think we got it dead.
2481960	2483200	Holy shit.
2486560	2489960	Did you guys know that the gunfight at the OK Corral,
2489960	2493400	most famous, most infamous gunfight probably of the West,
2493400	2496400	happened in Tombstone in 1881?
2496400	2498800	People always think of it as this, you know,
2498800	2499800	Tombstone, right?
2499800	2501120	Big gunfight.
2501120	2503400	Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday.
2503400	2508840	It only lasted 30 seconds, which is five rounds of this game.
2508840	2513080	And we're at the end of round three currently.
2513080	2516240	So this all adds up to me.
2516240	2517040	Yeah.
2517040	2517560	Yeah.
2517560	2521240	In just 20 seconds, we've literally dismantled our shot.
2521240	2524640	Could you share if Dr. Bobby Custard's head explodes
2524640	2528600	and his body flies off in a completely different direction
2528600	2530520	than where you actually shot?
2530520	2533640	Quentin Tarantino style?
2533640	2534200	Yeah, no.
2534200	2536720	He flies into the back of the wagon.
2536720	2540680	His headless body is just flung.
2540680	2543920	You Gallagher'd his head.
2543920	2546000	It's weird that that's the first Gallagher reference.
2546000	2548920	I was trying to get a Gallagher reference at the other house,
2548920	2552360	and I just couldn't work it in.
2552360	2556280	And pretty sure if Dr. Bobby Custard is fully, fully dead,
2556280	2561200	I need everyone to roll sanity for me, even me,
2561200	2562880	since I didn't see it.
2562880	2563600	No, not you.
2563600	2564920	You feel like Cotton.
2564920	2566760	Hey, I crit failed again, so.
2570200	2570800	Jesus.
2570800	2572600	My god, dude.
2572600	2573520	What is happening?
2573520	2575840	I don't know.
2575840	2580120	This has to be like our crit fails per minute
2580120	2583080	has to be a record right now.
2583080	2585440	So I lose like two sanity instead of one?
2585480	2586640	Yeah.
2586640	2588360	Yeah, that's exactly right.
2588360	2589800	I regular failed.
2589800	2592280	OK, you're going to lose one sanity, Everett Pace.
2592280	2594680	Jack Perlman knew it would lose two sanity.
2594680	2597240	And Professor Horace Green.
2597240	2598280	I pass.
2598280	2599360	Loses no sanity.
2599360	2602840	Totally cool with what he did to that guy.
2602840	2606720	And it blasted the wrong way, so he didn't even see it.
2606720	2609240	Exactly.
2609240	2612760	Completely blinded by the gunpowder.
2612760	2614720	Unable to see.
2614720	2619200	Here's a noise that sounds like, no, as it's happening.
2619200	2621200	And honestly, that noise is coming out
2621200	2624400	of these vocal cords that are hanging out
2624400	2628240	the top of this body, just waggling back and forth
2628240	2629920	in the arid wind.
2629920	2636040	And you assume that that noise is Tildy B. Mitchell,
2636040	2638400	the unnatural creature that you must have surely
2638400	2639600	killed just now.
2639600	2643160	However, at the top of this round,
2643160	2646720	you all see Tildy B releases the knife that
2646720	2649880	is in Jack Perlman's thigh and begins
2649880	2653080	running as fast as she can.
2653080	2653840	Away?
2653840	2654680	Away.
2654680	2655920	Oh.
2655920	2659320	She runs around the backside of the house.
2659320	2662640	And she actually runs so far in this round.
2662640	2664520	This is a six-second round.
2664520	2666640	She makes it about 75 yards.
2666640	2667920	Holy fuck.
2667920	2674520	And you could see that she is running up out of this area
2674520	2678560	in a southwesterly direction.
2678560	2682200	That's the son of a bitch what killed Dandelion.
2682200	2686120	I yell to no one in particular.
2686120	2689800	And with that is Judge Ephraim Cortland's turn.
2689800	2693480	He walks up the stairs, kicks the door as hard as he can,
2693480	2696040	and yells, Silas, get out here.
2696040	2698560	I'll burn your fucking house down.
2698560	2702880	And he is digging around in his pocket for his lighter.
2702880	2704160	Holy shit.
2704160	2706960	But I want to try to kick the door down at the same time.
2706960	2708000	Thin door.
2708000	2710280	You can certainly do that if everybody else could
2710280	2711280	take their headphones off.
2711600	2712100	Whew.
2721600	2726280	Judge Ephraim Cortland, the smell of rotten flesh
2726280	2728840	is the first thing you notice when
2728840	2731800	you kick in the front door of the coal abode.
2731800	2734320	At first, you think the stench could
2734320	2736920	be from the unattended dishes strewn
2736920	2741200	throughout this living room, the ruminants of several meals
2741200	2744080	now covered in a few buzzing flies.
2744080	2748480	But that static hum of these buzzing around flies
2748480	2753560	is so loud in your ears due to the large swarm hovering
2753560	2758080	above and about the body of Miss Kitty,
2758080	2762120	which is laying lifeless across one of the sitting chairs.
2762120	2766520	Lifeless, to be sure, because this body, the skin
2766520	2770840	is chewed up so badly that chunks are hanging off
2770880	2775000	or completely missing the dripping dark red blood pooling
2775000	2777520	below on the floor, but especially
2777520	2781280	lifeless due to the way this body is crumpled.
2781280	2787360	Her back held directly in the middle by one of the armrests
2787360	2793320	there at an unnatural angle as the top half of her torso
2793320	2797920	dangles straight down perpendicular to the floor.
2801360	2804400	Roll sanity.
2804400	2808360	A 50 on a 50.
2808360	2809240	Oh.
2809240	2813000	Make it a 49 as you lose one sanity
2813000	2816320	from this horrifying scene.
2816320	2822280	And go ahead and roll a listen check for me.
2822280	2823120	Fail.
2823120	2824240	That is all.
2824240	2825560	I'm going in.
2825560	2827040	Can I see Silas or?
2827040	2827840	No, no.
2827840	2829600	So this is a shotgun style house.
2829640	2832640	So basically front door leads to the first room
2832640	2835040	and there's one door all the way ahead of you.
2835040	2835640	Yep.
2835640	2836840	I'm going to keep going.
2836840	2837960	I want to find Silas.
2837960	2841600	And you're going to be able to make it to the next door.
2841600	2843240	Is it a closed door?
2843240	2844320	It's not like an archway.
2844320	2846320	It is a closed door.
2846320	2852400	While I'm going, I'm yelling, Silas, get your ass out here.
2852400	2852880	Awesome.
2859600	2867960	As this speedy, speedy teenage non-human
2867960	2871520	takes off into the distance, Judge Courtland
2871520	2873920	kicks in the door of the Silas home,
2873920	2877560	takes in his surroundings before you hear,
2877560	2881520	Silas, get your ass out here.
2881520	2882720	Sorry.
2882720	2883520	Who is it?
2883520	2885160	So many people on this list are dead now.
2885160	2885640	Everett.
2885960	2890080	It is Everett Pace.
2890080	2894480	I want to keep my gun now trained on the front door,
2894480	2896480	kind of given whatever kind of cover
2896480	2898160	I can if somebody comes out that front door.
2898160	2900160	But I want to be making my way to whoever
2900160	2903920	looks most injured between Jack and Horace.
2903920	2905720	I could visually tell that, couldn't I?
2905720	2908160	You would be able to visually tell which one is more injured.
2908160	2909560	Jack, what are your hit points at?
2909560	2910480	Five.
2910480	2911920	What are you at, Thomas?
2911920	2912440	Three.
2912440	2913120	Oh, shit.
2913120	2915040	I'm going to head over to Professor Horace
2915040	2919840	and try and do a little first aid on him.
2919840	2920400	That cool?
2925880	2927480	Professor Horace freaks out.
2927480	2930480	It's a crit pass, a 66 on a 70.
2930480	2931320	Yeah.
2931320	2932200	Four.
2932200	2934200	Four hit points right off the bat.
2934200	2937680	I feel like half my old self again.
2937680	2939440	Sheriff Bobby got his head blown off.
2939440	2941160	He just dropped all his medical supplies
2941160	2942280	right there on the ground.
2942880	2946320	I reached down and grabbed with one hand some gauze
2946320	2950480	and just like patted it into the knee area.
2950480	2953240	And I've done it a lot.
2953240	2955040	Living out there on the land by myself,
2955040	2957240	I had to patch up myself all the time.
2957240	2958280	So I'm real good at it.
2958280	2961800	And I keep one gun trained on the door, my rifle,
2961800	2964920	and the crook of my elbow here while I get his knee back
2964920	2965760	in tip top shape.
2965760	2966320	Perlin.
2966320	2970720	I would like to perform first aid on my leg, my thigh.
2970720	2971200	What?
2971200	2971960	My thigh.
2971960	2973920	My thigh.
2973920	2976760	Thigh.
2976760	2978760	Tell me about it, stud.
2978760	2983480	I want to rip off a chunk of my shirt with my teeth
2983480	2986240	and tear it up and then wrap it real tight.
2986240	2990800	It perfectly cuts like Queen Amidala.
2990800	2993840	It perfectly cuts into a cute little crop top.
2993840	2997320	Oh, yeah, I do from the tummy, not from my sleeve.
2997320	3000320	Remember that bullshit.
3000320	3003560	Yeah, I do the tummy cloth, not the arm.
3003560	3007120	I was thinking arm cloth, but I like the idea
3007120	3009800	of a long sleeve crop top.
3009800	3015000	Like a long sleeve dress shirt crop top.
3015000	3018480	Jack Perlman is a man of great fashion.
3018480	3021520	And of not weight.
3021520	3022680	Yeah, not passing.
3022680	3023680	Regular fail.
3023680	3025160	You just kind of wrap it around.
3025160	3027040	Yeah, great.
3027040	3031360	What happens if you push a first aid roll and then fail?
3031360	3035600	What's a crit, fail, first aid look like?
3035600	3037280	Slice the artery.
3037280	3039280	Do you want to find out?
3039280	3040200	I'm going to push it.
3040200	3041320	He's going to find out.
3041320	3042240	What's your first aid?
3042240	3043880	Yeah, is this worth it?
3043880	3044800	Oh, shit.
3044800	3047560	That's pretty good bad.
3047560	3048440	It's 50-50.
3048440	3049440	Pretty good, pretty bad.
3049440	3051200	Let's see what happens.
3051200	3053960	Do it for the vine, bro.
3053960	3054800	Oh, no.
3058040	3059600	Wait, hold on.
3059600	3060240	Yeah, yeah.
3060240	3061320	Yeah, that's a fail.
3061320	3064480	Yeah, I rolled the exact same fucking thing again.
3064480	3065880	What are the chances?
3065880	3068440	What is happening?
3068440	3072480	Jack Perlman, roll a D4.
3072480	3073360	Oh, a four.
3073360	3074000	That's good.
3077520	3082120	Jack, you wrap the shirt around, and it
3082120	3083520	doesn't stop the bleeding.
3083520	3085520	And so you think to yourself, well, obviously I've
3085520	3086880	got to get this knife out.
3086880	3089320	And so you grab onto the handle of your knife.
3089320	3092480	I thought she took the knife away and ran away with it.
3092480	3093760	No, she left it in there.
3093760	3094280	Oh, OK.
3094280	3095680	Did I say she ran off with it?
3095680	3096320	I think you might have.
3096320	3097120	I thought you did.
3097120	3099200	I thought you said she took it out.
3099200	3100760	OK, whatever works.
3100760	3102360	At some specific point, you did say
3102360	3104280	she dropped your knife, his knife.
3104280	3107440	I don't know if it was still in his leg when that happened or not.
3107440	3111560	In my mind, she was just holding it into his leg,
3111560	3116160	and then she let go and released it so that she could bail,
3116160	3118760	but just left it in his leg.
3118760	3120440	She doesn't need a knife.
3120440	3123120	She got chompy chompies.
3123120	3125280	She got chompy chompies.
3125280	3127280	So yeah, I gank that knife out.
3127280	3128560	Yeah, you pull it right out.
3128560	3131080	And as you pull it out, it nicks an artery,
3131080	3133720	and blood just starts going everywhere
3133720	3138880	as you're desperately trying to tie tighter and tighter
3138880	3142840	this shirt bottom around your leg.
3142840	3145280	And you lose four hit points.
3146280	3148960	Taking you from five to one.
3148960	3151040	So I'm going to need you to roll another constitution
3151040	3155040	check to stay conscious.
3155040	3155520	Joe?
3155520	3156840	Well, now that we know what happens
3156840	3159560	if you crit fail a first aid roll, just don't do it, Justin.
3164840	3166280	Seems pretty obvious in hindsight.
3166280	3170720	I rolled a crit success on my constitution check, a 44 on an 80.
3170720	3173680	Then you get to be awake for all this pain.
3173760	3176080	Extra awake, like super awake.
3176080	3180920	I'm so conscious during a time I wish I could pass out.
3180920	3184600	Blood is now soaking the dirt and creating
3184600	3190200	mudblood underneath the back of your knee here on the ground.
3190200	3191040	Mudblood.
3191040	3193560	And Professor Horsegreen, it is your turn.
3193560	3195680	Oh, also, Jack, your boots are ruined.
3195680	3198080	God damn it.
3198080	3200040	Blood is fully soaked into the leather
3200040	3202000	to the point of non-return.
3202000	3204160	Well, we're not in combat anymore, are we?
3204160	3205240	We are.
3205240	3206920	Oh, with Sylas.
3206920	3208880	How much mobility do I have?
3208880	3213440	Mechanically, you're going to be at a disadvantage on anything
3213440	3216320	that needs you to run or be dexterous or anything
3216320	3216920	like that.
3216920	3218760	But you can hobble.
3218760	3224040	So you're just as good as Everett Pace was always.
3224040	3225560	OK.
3225560	3227800	Well, when you put it like that, I hobble over
3227800	3229760	to where Everett is covering the door.
3229760	3231480	Is that what you did after you healed me?
3231480	3232640	I don't think I moved.
3232640	3234560	I think I just got to your position.
3234560	3236280	You're all three kind of bunched up
3236280	3239640	in this location, which I'm picturing about 10 yards away
3239640	3242920	from the front porch of the Cole home.
3242920	3245000	You guys are right out front.
3245000	3248800	Horsegreen crawls behind a wagon or a barrel
3248800	3251720	or whatever's in Sylas Cole's front yard to find some cover
3251720	3253720	and trains his pistol on the front door.
3253720	3256640	And you can very clearly hear Judge Ephraim Courtland
3256640	3258560	in the living room.
3258560	3263520	Just a reminder that he was in the first room of this house
3263520	3267480	hollering, Sylas, get your ass out here.
3267480	3269600	And the three of you can take your headphones off.
3278200	3281800	Judge Ephraim Courtland, as you are,
3281800	3283320	no, you failed your listen check.
3283320	3285240	So you're just kicking in the next door?
3285240	3285880	Yeah.
3285880	3288400	They're trying to just open it if it's open.
3288400	3289680	Oh, you're just going to open it?
3289680	3290320	If it is open.
3290320	3291880	Describe to me exactly what you do.
3291880	3293680	You know what, I'm pissed off and I'm big.
3293680	3298120	So after I'm yelling, get your ass out here,
3298120	3301360	I kick in the other door, the next door.
3301360	3305080	I need you to roll listen and spot hidden,
3305080	3306560	two separate rolls.
3306560	3307560	Listen first.
3307560	3310560	Listen first.
3310560	3313320	Fail the listen.
3313320	3318320	Crit success on the spot hit 33 on him.
3318320	3321120	45.
3321120	3326840	As you kick in the door, you find yourself in the bedroom.
3326840	3330320	The bed has been completely flipped over
3330320	3335440	to use as cover on the right side of this room.
3335440	3342040	And you see a small one inch in diameter metal sphere
3342040	3345800	rolling directly toward you.
3345800	3346920	What do you do?
3346960	3349280	I see the sphere, but I don't really
3349280	3350440	pay any attention to it.
3350440	3351600	Yeah, it's like a marble.
3351600	3352160	Yeah.
3352160	3354440	So I'm going to be careful not to slip on it,
3354440	3359440	but I'm going to go and just brute force grab the mattress
3359440	3361880	and throw it away to see if he's behind there.
3361880	3365960	When you grab the mattress, you just rip it away,
3365960	3369640	throw it right up against the wall to your side.
3369640	3372920	And you see Silas Cole, he's hunkered down
3372920	3378080	and he is chanting something quietly to himself.
3378080	3384400	Bob da ha ha, Bob da ha ha, Bob da ha ha, Bob da ha ha.
3384400	3385880	Can I grab him?
3385880	3387480	You can.
3387480	3388840	I just go up to him.
3388840	3391800	I put my right hand on a collar of a shirt.
3391800	3395080	My left hand, I grab one of the belts he's wearing
3395080	3397720	and I just lift him up over my head.
3397720	3403000	And as you do that, you feel a hot pinch
3403000	3404680	on the back of your neck.
3404680	3412240	And we, me and you, Luke, we see Judge Ephraim Courtland freeze.
3412240	3417000	Multiple shiny limbs extend from the small metal sphere
3417000	3421200	and slam into the wooden floor beneath you,
3421200	3425080	giving it the leverage it needs to shove down
3425080	3429320	as one of its appendages slices into the soft tissue
3429320	3432960	on the back of Judge Ephraim Courtland's neck.
3432960	3438440	Another snaps his head forward and you hear the fracture
3438440	3441520	as a third metal tendril reaches in,
3441520	3445520	gripping the top of Judge Courtland's spine
3445520	3449080	where it meets his head, the C1 vertebrae,
3449080	3454080	and it rips his entire spinal cord out of his body
3454080	3458600	in one swift motion, promptly forcing itself
3458600	3466080	into the now vacant spinal column of Judge Ephraim Courtland.
3466080	3468680	So this I'm gonna...
3468680	3474800	Judge Ephraim Courtland is now being controlled by M-A-R-Y.
3474800	3475880	Hell yeah.
3475880	3480600	So your goal is to make sure that there are no witnesses
3480600	3483160	to what has happened here on the property today.
3483160	3485160	There are a couple ways you can do this.
3485160	3491720	One, you can kill them.
3491720	3495520	You would be able to keep the body of Judge Courtland
3495520	3498560	if you wanted to do that and then control Courtland
3498560	3500800	whenever you wanted to around town.
3500800	3502560	It might be kind of tricky at this point.
3502560	3506880	M-A-R-Y typically likes to only control
3506880	3509920	like one townsperson at a time
3509920	3513720	and then other people that she can use for outside towns.
3513720	3516400	However, the judge would be a...
3516400	3519400	A pretty good one to have on their side.
3519400	3522440	So I could kill them or double agent style?
3522440	3526160	Yes. You could also, if they kill you,
3526160	3528120	that also works in your advantage,
3528120	3530040	but you typically don't want it.
3530040	3531920	You don't want someone else to be there
3531920	3533560	because then they'll know the secret,
3533560	3537480	and if they get away having known that, then you're fucked.
3537520	3541080	The third way is that Silas Cole, you know now,
3541080	3543160	that Silas Cole is chanting
3543160	3545320	and will continue to chant the spell
3545320	3548480	that after a couple rounds will open up a portal
3548480	3551960	in the floor of this room, the middle room of this house.
3551960	3554840	You know that there is a back room, which is the kitchen,
3554840	3556600	a front room, which is the living room,
3556600	3558920	and then the middle room, which is your guys' bedroom,
3558920	3562920	and the portal can be in front of both doors
3562920	3564520	on one side of the room.
3564520	3565600	And it's in the bedroom?
3565600	3569840	Yeah, so if they come in too quickly and they fail a check.
3569840	3570960	They get portaled.
3570960	3572560	This technicolor portal.
3572560	3573400	Okay, sweet.
3573400	3575680	So those are your options.
3575680	3577560	I like my options here.
3577560	3579240	Okay, and it's gonna be their turn,
3579240	3580760	so I'm gonna let them choose what happens next.
3580760	3583680	Okay, are we still doing, this is still one episode?
3583680	3585640	Oh shit, how long have we been playing?
