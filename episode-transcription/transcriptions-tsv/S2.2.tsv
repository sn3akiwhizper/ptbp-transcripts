0	7000	What's good, the internet. It is your web-savvy zaddy, Wolf the Dog. Net.
7000	15000	And we're coming at you live from 694.2 PTBP, the only radio station powered by Geocities.
15000	20000	Now, speaking of the World Wide Web and all of the beauty contained within,
20000	24000	this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Gary in Scarborough, England,
24000	27000	who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,
27000	30000	which is a thing you are also more than welcome to do.
30000	31000	Gary writes,
31000	32000	Howdy, Wolf.
32000	36000	It's your brother and long-time listener from across the pond.
36000	41000	I hope this finds you well and know that you should come here to Scarborough, Wolfie.
41000	45000	That's if you don't mind fighting off mutant-sized seagulls up at the castle
45000	48000	for that extra tasty grease you love oh so much.
48000	52000	I hear it will make you howl so hard you taste colors.
52000	57000	Anyway, I love the podcast that you, Zach, and the boys are providing for us folks.
57000	62000	Keep up the great work and a big shout-out to my girlfriend, Mel, and my buddy, Paul.
62000	67000	Well, hello, Brother Gary. You talkin' about castle slop?
67000	71000	And all I gotta do is beat some seagull ass to get a taste?
71000	73000	Sign me up, Brother Gary.
73000	80000	I hope I'm not being too sea-gullible here by accepting this travel invitation.
80000	84000	If you want to write up something for your Web 2.0 Wolf to Howl,

89000	92000	or write a five-star review and send us that screenshot.
92000	97000	Word of mouth through social media has been instrumental in getting this podcast to where it is today.
97000	102000	And I just want to say, from the bottom of my heart, fuck Mark Zuckerberg.
102000	108000	If you, too, have these feelings, you may find a nice community to join in our Discord or subreddit.
108000	112000	And if you want to give us money so we don't stop making this show,
112000	116000	you can do that on Patreon or our merch shop.
116000	119000	The links are in the show notes.
119000	122000	Now, it's time to catch up, but don't get confused.
122000	126000	Wolf don't work for Can, but it's time for the news.
126000	130000	Last time, we were introduced to Julius Summers,
130000	136000	the fresh-faced, thick-legged field producer who was just hired by his uncle, Typh Rayland,
136000	139000	the executive producer for the City Action News.
139000	144000	Julius picked up the former lead anchor of Can, Cal Colorado,
144000	147000	an elderly statesman of news in the city,
147000	151000	as well as their Hawaiian shirt-rocking cameraman, Beck Wilder.
151000	155000	The three put together a segment about the Godel Company,
155000	157000	top of the agricultural food chain,
157000	160000	buying up all the farmland just outside the city,
160000	163000	taking us now to that story as it unfolds.
163000	168000	It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.
193000	196000	It's All My Fault.
206000	210000	No one knows what it's like
210000	215000	behind these eyes.
215000	220000	Welcome to episode two of Pretending to Be People.
220000	224000	I had the Kelly Clarkson Hazel Eyes song stuck in my head.
224000	227000	Do you remember that Guitar Hero 2 song that was like,
227000	230000	you got radium eyes, never listened to it since.
230000	232000	No, but do you know about the radium girls?
232000	234000	No, what are the radium girls?
234000	235000	I do know about them.
235000	240000	So radium, before people really knew about how dangerous radioactive was,
240000	246000	it was kind of a craze to put radium in shit, including makeup.
246000	249000	At least the radium girls I know of, it was watches.
249000	253000	And they would lick the brushes as they put the dots on.
253000	256000	Yes, and that's why their jaws fell off.
256000	258000	They're all fine though?
258000	261000	Well, they would be dead. This happened.
261000	266000	They would be dead anyway, but they would not be fine.
266000	268000	No matter what, they would not be fine right now.
268000	271000	But they were not fine while they were still alive
271000	273000	because their fucking jaws fell off
273000	276000	because of the radium paint and the watch dials, right?
276000	280000	Yeah, it was probably the noon, three, six, and nine.
280000	286000	But they would dip the brushes in radium
286000	289000	and to get a fine point on the brush.
289000	292000	I don't know about fetishized, but they were looked up upon
292000	294000	because they kind of glowed.
294000	299000	They called the radium girls, they were like angels.
299000	302000	Talk about unachievable beauty standards, you know what I mean?
302000	303000	That radium glow?
303000	305000	Truly, truly unattainable.
305000	307000	I photoshop all my porn to be slightly for life.
307000	309000	I'm sorry, you photoshop your what?
309000	310000	My porn?
310000	311000	Yeah, you photoshop it?
311000	313000	Yeah, to have a radium glow.
313000	316000	So you put in work ahead of time or during?
316000	317000	During.
317000	319000	Oh, okay. Ask the answer.
319000	321000	That's just a filter pass, that's easy.
321000	323000	There's a book called The Radium Girls,
323000	326000	The Dark Story of America's Shining Women.
326000	328000	Is it erotica?
328000	329000	It is for me.
329000	332000	But there was also a movie that I think flopped
332000	334000	but it had an early Joey King in it.
334000	335000	Who?
335000	336000	In 2018.
336000	338000	The guy from Kingaroo Jack, I think.
341000	342000	Kingaroo Jack.
342000	344000	Let's go around and talk about these characters.
344000	348000	I want physical descriptions to remind us of who these people are
348000	351000	and what they wear on a day to day basis
351000	353000	and just like the vibe they give off.
353000	354000	Let's start with Joe.
354000	357000	Beck, he's got a closet full of Hawaiian shirts,
357000	360000	patterned shirts but mostly Hawaiian shirts.
360000	361000	Beck Wilder.
361000	362000	Beck Wilder.
363000	364000	Beck Wilder.
364000	366000	He's a little bit slovenly.
366000	369000	Sometimes buttons are mismatched on his shirts.
369000	371000	He obviously doesn't care a whole lot about his appearance.
371000	375000	He often just throws a baseball cap over his messy hair.
375000	378000	His outward appearance is almost buffoonery.
379000	381000	Oh, you had mentioned his shorts as well.
381000	382000	Oh, yeah.
382000	383000	He's got confident shorts.
383000	384000	He's got the cargoiest of shorts.
384000	386000	Yeah, he's got a craftsman's shorts.
388000	389000	We're talking loops.
389000	390000	We're talking pockets.
390000	391000	So many pockets, dude.
391000	392000	Oh, my God.
392000	393000	He's lost things in there before.
393000	397000	We're talking carabiners with all kinds of weird attachments.
397000	400000	He's thought about going full pants just to have more space for pockets,
400000	403000	but he just loves the breeze on his calves.
404000	406000	He needs to look into those zip-offs.
406000	407000	Oh, he does.
407000	408000	He should have zip-offs.
408000	412000	But he might leave the things in the zip-offed pockets somewhere by accident.
412000	413000	Wow.
413000	414000	That's the thing that Beck would definitely do.
414000	415000	That's forward thinking.
415000	418000	Know yourself, Beck Wilder.
418000	424000	Hey, Slacker, is he canonically kin to Van Wilder?
425000	426000	No.
426000	427000	I hadn't thought about that, but that's good.
428000	429000	That was a sharp no.
429000	430000	A hard no.
430000	431000	A hard no.
431000	435000	Sorry, listeners, because Joe just shut off the National Lampoon's Wilder world.
435000	436000	Write that down for us.
437000	439000	Yeah, no Van Wilder.
439000	443000	Right, but our ride, he does call Van Wilder.
443000	444000	That's what Beck calls it.
445000	448000	That's what he calls his sweet Krieger van that he has.
450000	454000	Beck, who's the person that you interact with most?
454000	458000	Who's the person that you text most, call most, the person you see most?
458000	459000	His mom.
459000	460000	Yeah.
460000	461000	And what's her name?
461000	462000	Boy.
462000	464000	Her name's Boy Wilder?
465000	466000	Yep.
466000	468000	It sure does seem like a thing I should have thought of.
468000	469000	I like Boy Wilder.
469000	470000	Not really.
470000	472000	I think Boy Wilder is your mom's name, man.
472000	476000	Zach just kind of sprung that on you after saying we wouldn't be using bonds, so.
476000	480000	I didn't mean that your characters wouldn't know people.
481000	484000	You said we are loners and don't know us little person.
484000	485000	Yeah, we're weird.
485000	486000	No bonds.
486000	487000	No friends.
487000	488000	No gods.
488000	489000	No family.
489000	490000	No kings.
490000	495000	In our former lives, we were only friends with each other, and so we haven't gotten to
495000	496000	that point yet.
496000	500000	Well, we haven't gotten to us describing our characters, but I do think for Cal, his legitimate
500000	501000	answer is Beck.
501000	502000	Ah, interesting.
502000	503000	Kim.
503000	506000	Kim Wilder is Beck's mom.
506000	507000	Cool.
507000	511000	What was wrong with Boy?
512000	513000	Just a different three-letter name.
513000	517000	Kim Wilder is your mom, and what kind of relationship do you have with Kim?
517000	518000	Pretty iffy.
518000	527000	We're close as far as we probably talk to each other every day, but it's a weird relationship.
527000	530000	He doesn't like his mom a whole lot.
530000	532000	Joe, my God.
534000	535000	Joe, my God.
535000	537000	Joe.
539000	541000	He did not silence his phone.
541000	542000	My phone was not on silent.
542000	543000	That's true.
543000	546000	You're kicked out of the Alamo draft house.
546000	547000	I got the ticket thing.
547000	549000	It's exceedingly decent here.
549000	551000	20 bucks, movie every day.
551000	552000	Oh, no.
552000	553000	That actually, that shit.
553000	554000	It's so sick.
554000	555000	It's a really good deal.
555000	559000	It's a movie pass type deal, and I hope it doesn't mean that Alamo is about to go under
559000	560000	grade.
560000	561000	It is.
561000	565000	The second they weren't making that delicious cold brew anymore, I knew that it was...
565000	568000	Man, their menu is so parsed down now.
568000	570000	Luke can't get his Italian sodas.
570000	574000	I can't get my fucking cream soda.
574000	579000	I will say, dude, past two times I've been, horrible service.
579000	580000	Oh, bummer.
580000	582000	Dude, I literally, I went and saw Top Gun.
582000	584000	It took an hour and a half to get my food.
584000	585000	Oh, shit.
585000	586000	Like almost the end of the night.
586000	587000	Oh, that sucks.
587000	588000	That's awful.
589000	590000	Cold fried cauliflower.
590000	592000	Counterpoint, I had great service the last time I went.
592000	595000	Well, they've added that button, which I feel like now I get immediate service.
595000	599000	Oh, the thing is Luke didn't press the button for an hour and a half.
599000	602000	No, I literally got there early, ordered it, and then...
602000	603000	Oh, you got there too early.
603000	606000	No, I got there, I was probably one of the last people to do that.
606000	608000	Luke, we're pretty sure this is something you did.
608000	610000	We are really trying to turn this around on you, aren't you?
610000	612000	Hey, Luke, I'm sorry that happened to you.
612000	613000	Hey, here's what I'll say.
613000	617000	It was a full, I didn't, I wasn't even that mad because it was a full theater, two servers
617000	618000	for the whole thing.
618000	619000	Oh, yeah, that's hard.
619000	620000	That is hard.
620000	623000	Well, but you're the guy I know who's been there the most, so probably you just suck
623000	624000	at going there.
626000	627000	You're probably just bad at it.
627000	628000	You don't know what you're doing.
628000	629000	I'll have to look up tips and tricks, I guess.
629000	630000	Tips and tricks.
631000	634000	Did you not Google Alamo Drafthouse tips and tricks Reddit before you went?
634000	641000	Usually I do like FAQ or like a walkthrough, so that I don't have to buy the book at Walmart.
643000	646000	Beck Wilder has an iffy relationship with his mother, Kim Wilder.
646000	648000	Let's talk a little bit about Julia Summers.
648000	649000	Wait, real quick.
649000	650000	What does your mom look like?
650000	651000	Oh, yeah.
651000	652000	Hit us with that mom look.
652000	653000	She's a...
653000	654000	Make her hot.
654000	655000	No, she's a...
655000	656000	Make her so hot.
656000	659000	She's a far side woman with the beehive and the cat eye glasses.
659000	661000	And you said you weren't going to make her hot?
661000	663000	I was going to say, I think we convinced him.
663000	665000	Does she have a fat lip?
665000	666000	Fat lip.
666000	667000	Far side.
667000	671000	When's the last time you saw a far side comic?
671000	673000	And, uh, Julia Summers.
673000	675000	Wait, what is the fat lip reference?
675000	679000	So, The Far Side, which is a rap group, hip-hop.
679000	681000	Uh, with a C-Y.
681000	685000	Yeah, The Far Side, F-P-H-A-R-C-Y-D-E.
685000	689000	Not the classic single panel cartoon by Gary Lawson.
689000	690000	Fat lip.
690000	691000	Nice.
696000	697000	Julia Summers.
697000	700000	Julia is walking into the party like his name is...
700000	701000	I don't know that.
702000	705000	Is that a far side reference?
705000	707000	No, it's a fat lip reference.
707000	708000	Some 41.
708000	709000	Plus 44?
709000	710000	No, some 41.
710000	713000	Quick rundown on Julia Summers.
713000	715000	You look at him at a glance.
715000	716000	5'6".
716000	718000	Monochromatic suit.
718000	721000	Depending on the day of the week, tan, black, grey, blue.
721000	722000	Short king.
722000	724000	Short king, big thighs.
724000	726000	How tall is he?
726000	727000	5'6".
727000	729000	Is that short?
729000	730000	Sorry.
730000	731000	That's about how tall I am.
731000	732000	It's a poor one.
732000	733000	No, you're like...
733000	734000	I'm like 5'7", maybe.
734000	735000	Short king.
737000	738000	We need to re-measure you.
738000	739000	I don't think you're that much shorter.
739000	740000	I think you're taller than me too.
740000	741000	Yeah, I think you're taller than that.
741000	743000	Yeah, guys, I'm 6'5".
748000	751000	Go back, if you're new to listening to this, go back on our social media.
751000	753000	Check at PretendingPod on Instagram.
753000	755000	You will see that I tower over these guys.
755000	758000	We post tons of pictures of us just like hanging out and doing our own shit.
758000	763000	A lot of us standing side by side so that you can compare how tall I am to these guys.
763000	766000	Yeah, see if you can figure out which one Luke is based on this conversation.
766000	771000	You should definitely check out our lineup shot if you really want to get some inside
771000	772000	of this.
772000	773000	We have all of our mug shots on there.
773000	774000	Yeah.
774000	775000	Anyway.
775000	778000	Julie Summers, monochromatic suits.
778000	782000	Lives in the suburbs outside of the city with his roommate.
782000	783000	Suburbs.
783000	785000	That's who he spends the most time with.
785000	786000	Oh, sick.
786000	787000	Who's his roommate?
787000	788000	He moved to this house.
788000	791000	He just bought this house, but he needs a roommate to afford it.
791000	794000	And it's a lady that he found on Craigslist.
794000	795000	Cool.
795000	796000	What's her name?
796000	797000	Her name?
797000	798000	He hasn't found it out yet.
798000	799000	Named her yet.
799000	800000	He just moved in.
800000	802000	Oh, or did she introduce herself and you just don't remember?
802000	805000	That is what happened.
805000	808000	Julie Summers, producer.
808000	809000	Not good with names.
809000	811000	Nephew of my uncle.
811000	815000	I'm not great with names either, and I just want to say it's fucked up that names are
815000	818000	the first thing we say instead of the last when we're meeting people.
818000	821000	I always say, I've been Joe Terry.
821000	823000	This has been Joe Terry.
823000	826000	It was a pleasure meeting me.
826000	830000	You've been enjoying the sonic sounds of Joe Terry.
830000	831000	Hey, what's your name?
831000	833000	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
833000	835000	Let me describe what I look like first.
835000	838000	Getting a little fresh here, huh?
838000	842000	Don't you want to know about my outfits and bonds?
843000	845000	Julia Summers is here because of nepotism.
845000	849000	His uncle, Tife Rayland.
849000	850000	Rayland.
850000	851000	Tife Rayland.
851000	856000	Tife Rayland is your uncle and he is the executive producer of the City Action News.
856000	858000	He is, how would you describe him?
858000	860000	I'd say darn good at his job.
860000	862000	Demanding, but rewarding.
862000	864000	You know, he is also my uncle's.
864000	866000	I don't think I can say anything bad.
866000	868000	Well, he's my whole, he's my whole uncle.
868000	871000	He asked you to do something.
871000	872000	Go to the farm.
872000	875000	And then he also asked you to do one more thing.
877000	881000	I think he said it twice and he said, you definitely need to remember to do this.
881000	885000	I don't think you ever said you definitely need to remember to do this.
885000	887000	Maybe not in those words.
887000	888000	Hold on, Zach.
888000	891000	This is not in my notes, which doesn't mean anything on its own.
891000	893000	But Joe made a face at that.
893000	896000	And it's not in his notes, which means.
896000	898000	Someone's lying.
898000	901000	Someone didn't say what they were supposed to say.
902000	906000	He changed his tone and said, no, I'm real serious this time.
906000	907000	Okay.
907000	910000	You have to make it 90 seconds.
912000	916000	That's really, I grasped onto 90 seconds and then I didn't really do that.
916000	917000	You did.
917000	922000	And but then every interaction you were like, this needs to be 90 seconds instead of just the whole segment.
924000	926000	But that's Luke trying to remember.
926000	927000	Sure.
927000	929000	Go ahead and roll an intelligence check for me there.
929000	930000	Not even Joe remembers.
930000	932000	This is so rude.
933000	934000	Yeah, I don't got it, but.
934000	935000	Here's the deal.
935000	937000	Whatever I rolled, I think.
939000	941000	This is a horror podcast.
942000	944000	Are you scared?
949000	951000	What was I rolling on?
952000	954000	I think you failed.
955000	958000	It's a 98, but you know, just making sure.
960000	963000	Julius doesn't have a 99 intelligence, does he?
965000	966000	No.
966000	969000	All right, Julius, I guess you'll find out in character.
969000	970000	Let's go to Cal, Colorado.
970000	972000	Remind me of what you look like, sir.
972000	977000	Cal, Colorado is in his late fifties, but he's tall and handsome for his age.
977000	979000	Handsome at any age.
979000	981000	That's why he's on TV.
981000	988000	He wears, um, Julius mentioned that a lot of his suits he inherited from his dad and they have nineties cuts.
988000	991000	Cal has the exact same cuts.
991000	993000	Do you guys match?
993000	994000	Wait, how tall are you?
994000	995000	I think he's like 6'3".
995000	996000	Go huge.
997000	998000	He's 6'3".
998000	1000000	I'm 6'7".
1001000	1005000	I am 9 feet tall and 400 pounds.
1005000	1007000	I lean down to interview you.
1007000	1010000	My voice shakes the glass when I speak.
1012000	1014000	All right, so just like a normal height.
1014000	1016000	Yeah, 6'3", average height.
1016000	1019000	I'm not as tall, like as short as Luke, but that hurts.
1020000	1024000	The average height is generally around 6'6".
1026000	1031000	He was reading that off of his phone for those of you listening at home.
1031000	1035000	And now he's showing me his phone from too far away to read to fact check.
1035000	1037000	Average height in the NBA.
1038000	1041000	Auto-correct, I guess.
1041000	1043000	Well, I mean, that's an important point.
1043000	1048000	Cal was great on his college basketball team, but he didn't have the stuff to go pro.
1048000	1051000	He always thought if he had three extra inches, he might have been able to do that.
1051000	1053000	But he was pretty happy with his career until now.
1053000	1055000	Did he go to City State U?
1055000	1056000	No, actually he went to the Missouri.
1056000	1059000	He went to the University of Missouri School of Journalism.
1059000	1061000	Oh, very nice.
1061000	1063000	I went to that for a year.
1063000	1064000	Really?
1065000	1066000	The journalism school?
1066000	1067000	Hell yeah.
1067000	1069000	Who is Cal Colorado's closest human contact?
1069000	1073000	So yeah, currently, as far as like most frequent contact, it's Beck.
1073000	1078000	Julius just got here, but we've been out on these segments for a few months now, I think.
1078000	1079000	Cool.
1079000	1084000	As far as the person he's closest to in life, that's his daughter, Carol Colorado.
1084000	1085000	Carol Colorado.
1085000	1089000	We talked about this a little in Session Zero, and it may manifest itself more organically,
1089000	1092000	but just to throw it out there, I think that we said that you and I get along pretty well.
1092000	1095000	Like, even though I'm kind of the opposite of everything you are.
1095000	1099000	So one thing that Cal does not have is any kind of technology skills.
1099000	1107000	He was a handsome dude on TV all through like the 80s and 90s, and he did not have to learn how to use computers.
1107000	1111000	So he really appreciates the tech guys who get shit done.
1111000	1112000	Sure.
1112000	1114000	Does he consider Beck like a magician?
1116000	1120000	Well, kind of. He's like, anything you need, I know Beck can do.
1120000	1124000	He does consider Beck a magician when he's like, hey Beck, can you fix my phone for me?
1124000	1125000	Fix my phone for me.
1127000	1129000	You had it locked in portrait mode. Here you go.
1130000	1132000	There was just a hair on your screen.
1134000	1135000	Do I have games on this?
1137000	1139000	What's your relationship like with your daughter?
1140000	1142000	It's strained, and we'll leave it at that.
1143000	1145000	Okay. Does she live in the city?
1145000	1149000	No. She lives in a city, but she lives many states away.
1149000	1150000	In a city?
1150000	1151000	Yeah.
1151000	1152000	You live in the city.
1152000	1153000	The city.
1153000	1154000	Yeah, we live in the city.
1155000	1159000	Beck lives with his mom, and he's going to hear it that he didn't say bye to her when he left this morning.
1159000	1160000	Awesome.
1162000	1164000	Does he hang dong around his mom?
1166000	1168000	Oh, yeah. Did we get a reading on Beck's dong?
1168000	1170000	Oh, it was hanging out of his pants.
1170000	1171000	Spilling. I think this is spilling.
1171000	1172000	We're tighty-whities.
1172000	1173000	You're an excellent interviewer.
1174000	1175000	Kravitsian.
1175000	1176000	Thank you.
1177000	1181000	How was Julius's dong? We said that was average, right?
1181000	1182000	No, you couldn't-
1182000	1183000	Not visible from behind.
1183000	1184000	Correct.
1184000	1185000	Oh, right.
1185000	1186000	No thigh gap.
1186000	1187000	But only because he has those crazy thighs.
1187000	1189000	Right. So, TBD.
1189000	1190000	Wait. Yeah.
1190000	1191000	Mm-hmm.
1191000	1192000	To be dick-sized.
1194000	1195000	With a hyphen.
1195000	1197000	Cal, Colorado has a huge hog.
1198000	1199000	I'm cutting all this.
1201000	1203000	Okay, then my penis is so small.
1204000	1205000	Beck doesn't have one.
1206000	1207000	That's fine.
1207000	1209000	His mom said, either put some pants on or-
1209000	1210000	I'm taking it off.
1210000	1211000	Get that thing off of it.
1211000	1213000	Well, Cal, Colorado has a huge hog.
1216000	1218000	And he wears out-of-date suits.
1222000	1226000	Zach, once we left off, we had just finished wrapping up at the farm,
1226000	1227000	and it sounded like we had what we needed.
1228000	1231000	Yeah, it sounds like it was time to turn our segment into the studio.
1232000	1234000	I think it's time to turn the segment into the studio.
1235000	1237000	It's time to turn the segment into the studio.
1237000	1239000	It's time to turn the segment into the studio.
1239000	1240000	You guys are-
1240000	1242000	It's time to turn the segment into the studio?
1244000	1245000	In character, please.
1245000	1248000	It's time to turn the segment into the studio.
1249000	1250000	Mine wasn't in character. I didn't-
1251000	1253000	Okay, one more again. In character. Joe?
1254000	1256000	It's time to turn the segment into the studio.
1258000	1261000	It's time to turn the segment into the studio.
1261000	1264000	It's time to turn the segment into the studio.
1264000	1267000	And with that, you guys pull up to City Action News.
1267000	1268000	What's a building look like?
1268000	1269000	What's a building look like?
1269000	1270000	Cool.
1270000	1272000	It's like marble and glass.
1272000	1274000	Ooh, very cool.
1274000	1276000	Marble columns, glass walls.
1276000	1277000	Yeah.
1277000	1278000	Yeah.
1278000	1279000	Marble countertops.
1279000	1280000	Literally marble and glass.
1280000	1281000	Marble floors.
1281000	1282000	Ooh.
1282000	1284000	We are hemorrhaging money.
1284000	1286000	We spent way too much money on this building.
1287000	1289000	And kind of as a tongue-in-cheek thing,
1289000	1295000	the walkway to the door is kind of like a winding thing with marbles in it.
1295000	1298000	We are currently jackhammering that out
1298000	1304000	because we've already had so many slip and falls and threats of library.
1304000	1306000	Well, they're not loose marbles.
1306000	1308000	I know, but marbles sticking out.
1308000	1309000	They're shiny.
1309000	1310000	They're round, smooth.
1310000	1311000	Yeah.
1311000	1312000	Humps.
1312000	1313000	You can slip on shiny things.
1313000	1315000	You can slip on anything.
1315000	1317000	Yeah, but especially shiny things.
1318000	1322000	Julius shakes his head and reminisces about his time.
1322000	1324000	How good it looked for him.
1324000	1328000	His time as a young boy trying to pick the marbles out of the walkway.
1333000	1338000	As one pops loose, it hits your feet as you guys are entering into the station.
1338000	1339000	Pick it up.
1339000	1342000	A sentimental tear starts to well up in his eye,
1342000	1347000	and he picks it up, and he puts it in the little pocket in his pants.
1347000	1349000	You know the little pocket?
1349000	1351000	Yo, I'm aware of the little pocket.
1351000	1354000	He flicks a marble in somebody's eye in like 40 episodes.
1355000	1356000	Sentimentally.
1356000	1358000	In parentheses.
1362000	1363000	All right, cool.
1363000	1365000	Let's dive on into...
1365000	1366000	Dive on in.
1366000	1367000	That's not a dive.
1367000	1368000	Luke, you're the producer.
1368000	1369000	You're in charge here.
1369000	1373000	You know that this segment needs to go into the editing bay,
1373000	1377000	and the executive producer, your uncle, Tyfe,
1377000	1380000	is likely in his office where he normally is,
1380000	1386000	and you would imagine that the standard CAN news crew,
1386000	1393000	which is the anchor weather person and sports segment host.
1396000	1397000	The SSH.
1397000	1402000	They're likely on set rehearsing for the show's evening news.
1402000	1404000	Hey Peck, do you have the tape?
1404000	1407000	I mean, it's not tape these days, old man, but yeah.
1407000	1409000	I got the footage.
1409000	1410000	You knew what I meant.
1410000	1411000	How old are you guys? Sorry.
1411000	1412000	I'm 29.
1413000	1415000	I was mid-30s.
1417000	1418000	Awesome.
1418000	1419000	It's not tape, boomer.
1419000	1422000	Julius says, you know what I meant,
1422000	1425000	but Julius totally was thinking of like a VHS tape.
1427000	1428000	Let's go to the bay.
1428000	1430000	Yeah, I'll get it loaded up.
1430000	1433000	And then I don't move, and I'm kind of waiting for him to like
1433000	1436000	hopefully go to where the bay is because I don't know where it is.
1437000	1441000	Beck's heading there, and this is almost a pseudo office of his.
1441000	1442000	Yeah.
1442000	1443000	He's here a lot.
1443000	1444000	Absolutely.
1444000	1448000	And yeah, you pop in, and the editor is hard at work,
1448000	1451000	pouring over multiple monitors, computer in front of her,
1451000	1455000	and she's just like overwhelmed completely with stuff,
1455000	1460000	and she's like, hey, you got the farmer segment coming in?
1460000	1461000	What's her name?
1461000	1462000	You're going to want to see this.
1462000	1464000	Her name is...
1464000	1465000	Vivica.
1465000	1466000	Her name?
1466000	1467000	Oh, her name?
1467000	1468000	Her name?
1468000	1469000	Oh, you're asking me?
1469000	1470000	Her name?
1470000	1471000	An NPC.
1471000	1473000	Vivica Johnston, obviously.
1473000	1474000	There you go.
1474000	1475000	Vivica.
1475000	1477000	Hey, Viv, got that footage for you.
1477000	1478000	Oh, thank you, thank you.
1478000	1479000	Oh, my goodness.
1479000	1480000	Okay, let's get going, let's get going.
1480000	1481000	Okay, what do we got?
1481000	1484000	Do we need to cut a bunch, or is it mostly good to go?
1484000	1486000	Beck, at this point, this is something that you probably,
1486000	1488000	you guys have seen, the audience hasn't seen,
1488000	1490000	that he kind of almost flips a switch at this point
1490000	1493000	and is almost robotic and able to relay to her
1493000	1495000	at three minutes and 33 seconds.
1495000	1498000	We've got a footage of the corn at four minutes and 56 seconds
1498000	1499000	is when the interview starts.
1499000	1501000	It ends at 593.
1501000	1504000	He's just running down a list from memory
1504000	1506000	of what he shot in a time stamp.
1506000	1508000	Here's where the star wipe should go.
1508000	1510000	Julius, don't forget the crabs.
1510000	1511000	Oh, and the crabs.
1511000	1512000	Wait, Julius?
1512000	1514000	Julius says is what I meant.
1517000	1518000	Nailed that.
1518000	1520000	Absolutely nailed it.
1521000	1524000	Like a man slipping on a floor covered in marbles.
1524000	1527000	And then landing perfectly on his feet.
1527000	1531000	Julius' mind is mostly in his pocket and in that walkway.
1531000	1533000	Oh, wow.
1533000	1536000	I mean, yeah, dude, you're probably deep in some nostalgia here.
1536000	1537000	It's weird.
1537000	1538000	I know that feeling.
1538000	1539000	The smell.
1539000	1541000	The marble floors of your youth.
1541000	1542000	Ooh.
1542000	1543000	Smell that marble.
1543000	1545000	Ooh, that smell.
1547000	1548000	Very cool.
1548000	1552000	Vivica gets going and is just at the exact pace of your notes.
1552000	1555000	It's cracking the fuck out of this edit.
1555000	1558000	She is on like seven monitors at the same time.
1558000	1561000	We do the thing from NCIS where we're both typing on the same keyboard.
1561000	1562000	Yes.
1563000	1566000	Dude, we've got some really talented professionals here at Cannes.
1566000	1567000	Oh, absolutely.
1567000	1569000	Cannes is city action news.
1569000	1572000	Julius is admiring in the very center of this room
1572000	1575000	the see-through dry erase board
1575000	1577000	that you can totally get right on both sides of.
1577000	1578000	Oh, my God.
1578000	1579000	Nice.
1579000	1582000	Traffic, sports, weather, news.
1582000	1584000	Cannes, Cannes.
1584000	1587000	And then you see in the lineup is the farmer segment
1587000	1591000	is lined up in that three-quarter slot.
1591000	1595000	It's not right at the top, but it's safely nuzzled in.
1595000	1598000	There are a couple commercial breaks from the beginning
1598000	1601000	like stay tuned for the farm thing.
1601000	1602000	Oh, yeah.
1602000	1603000	Absolutely.
1603000	1606000	Coming up, a look at the Godel farm acquisition program.
1606000	1608000	She turns back to you and she says,
1608000	1612000	okay, do we want to keep any of this passion and bleep it
1612000	1614000	or are we just cutting all that?
1614000	1616000	We're going to keep and bleep
1616000	1619000	and put obviously explicit warning before we air the segment.
1619000	1621000	Oh, that's good.
1621000	1624000	And she pulls up this like dong dong music
1624000	1627000	that's like really intense with this.
1627000	1631000	There's some image that's like blurred in the background that looks tense,
1631000	1635000	some sort of discordant scene happening behind words
1635000	1639000	that ominously say viewer discretion is advised.
1639000	1643000	Hey, make sure on the promos we need to have the crab man.
1643000	1648000	For real? Like really?
1648000	1651000	If you were watching the news and you saw a crab man,
1651000	1654000	aren't you going to stay tuned until you see what the crab man is?
1654000	1655000	Wow.
1655000	1657000	I guess that's why they hired you as the producer,
1657000	1660000	she says, is she's just like click clacking away.
1660000	1662000	I got some good footage of him at 1205.
1662000	1663000	Fucking rad.
1663000	1667000	We just put this thing together and then we are ready to go.
1667000	1671000	When you show the end result to Cal Colorado,
1671000	1675000	you call him into the room to be like, hey, we've got the 90 seconds up.
1675000	1677000	Can I make one thing?
1677000	1685000	I do want Julius to ensure that there is at least one good clip of Cal in this segment.
1685000	1686000	Cal.
1686000	1689000	Yeah, Cal comes in and he watches the segment
1689000	1692000	and he sees that shot that didn't really have to be there.
1692000	1698000	He's kind of quiet and he's just like, good work, good work, team.
1698000	1701000	I'm sorry, I need to use the restroom.
1701000	1703000	And he kind of runs out crying.
1703000	1706000	And if you look out the door, you see the rest of the news team,
1706000	1710000	the anchor and the sports person and the weather person,
1710000	1712000	all kind of laughing in a huddle.
1712000	1715000	Oh, no, man.
1715000	1719000	Julius sees all of that happen and looks over at Beck,
1719000	1723000	90% angry and 10% a little just sad.
1723000	1728000	Beck did the last segment producer typically cut out all of Cal's screen time.
1728000	1730000	Yeah, unfortunately.
1730000	1731000	Oof.
1731000	1735000	And it sucks because he's good at what he does.
1735000	1740000	Vivica is like, wow, I think you're building a strong team.
1740000	1742000	She says to the producer and holds out her hand.
1742000	1744000	She says, Vivica Johnston.
1744000	1748000	Julius shakes her hand and says, I don't plan on being sick much,
1748000	1752000	but if I'm not here, there's always a shot at Cal.
1752000	1753000	Good to know.
1753000	1754000	Thank you.
1754000	1756000	I think Beck swells with a little bit of pride to hear that.
1756000	1758000	He's happy to hear that.
1758000	1764000	And then Julius says, where's my uncle?
1764000	1767000	Isn't it nap time?
1767000	1772000	You see a PA who's like running around like a...
1772000	1773000	A chicken with its head cut off?
1773000	1776000	Man, I really didn't want to say that, huh?
1776000	1781000	Trigger warning if you're a chicken.
1781000	1785000	Trigger warning animal cruelty.
1785000	1788000	Sorry, running around like a person with their head cut off.
1788000	1789000	That's right.
1789000	1792000	There's a young man with his head cut off running around outside,
1792000	1795000	screaming, wait, how?
1795000	1799000	Out of the hole above his shoulders?
1799000	1801000	That is legitimately terrifying.
1801000	1802000	This is where the horror starts.
1802000	1804000	Such a good horror podcast.
1804000	1805000	Oops, not yet.
1806000	1812000	The blood is squirting out of his jugular and reaching the top of the building.
1812000	1814000	Beck wants to investigate the headless man?
1814000	1815000	I would too.
1815000	1822000	He can't because there's a segment producer yelling at that headless man for getting blood.
1822000	1826000	Jeremy, the window cleaners just came.
1826000	1830000	You're running around like a chicken with your head cut off.
1830000	1832000	Jeremy pops in and he's like,
1832000	1837000	Hey guys, I'm just trying to find Cal.
1837000	1838000	Type what's Cal.
1838000	1841000	And you guys too, if you want to go on up there.
1841000	1844000	He's in the restroom, dude. We'll get him there though.
1844000	1846000	Okay, yeah, he's really weighing on you guys.
1846000	1848000	So if you want to get up there fast, do you guys need anything?
1848000	1849000	Coffee's busted.
1849000	1851000	Julius is going to test this out.
1853000	1854000	Oat milk latte?
1854000	1855000	Oat milk latte?
1855000	1857000	Yeah, there's a place about four blocks down.
1857000	1858000	Sure.
1858000	1859000	Iced hot.
1859000	1861000	Okay, iced hot.
1861000	1862000	Iced hot.
1863000	1864000	Gross.
1864000	1869000	Beck wants two energy drinks, but we're going to wait until we get sponsored by one before I name one.
1870000	1871000	That's smart.
1871000	1873000	But it's two of the same energy drink.
1873000	1876000	I think we can comfortably punch in Monster now.
1877000	1879000	Man, I love energy drink.
1879000	1883000	Truly, I pop one open in the morning, bam, I'm ready to go.
1883000	1886000	Well, my favorite thing is how good and healthy for you energy drink is.
1886000	1888000	Right, the ingredients list, have you looked at it?
1888000	1892000	That's just my opinion, that claim has not been approved by the FDA.
1892000	1893000	You're a doctor.
1893000	1895000	Oh, no, I was lying to you, Zach.
1895000	1896000	Oh.
1896000	1897000	Wait.
1898000	1904000	So, yeah, listeners, Zach, Joe, Luke, I lied about my credentials to get on this podcast.
1904000	1906000	I am not a doctor.
1906000	1912000	So when you said your name is Dr. Cox and that you were a urologist, and I did, and you, that was a lie?
1912000	1915000	Yeah, wasn't it weird that I made you examine my penis?
1916000	1918000	You're a great teacher.
1925000	1926000	All right.
1926000	1927000	Where are those rails?
1927000	1928000	Let's find them.
1928000	1930000	Yeah, they're right in front of you.
1931000	1933000	I know, let's get back to them.
1935000	1939000	No, no, no, I love like walking alongside them.
1939000	1941000	It's an enjoyable.
1941000	1943000	Fair enough, let's walk alongside them.
1943000	1945000	Stand by me-ing.
1948000	1950000	I do want to see a dead body.
1951000	1953000	Well, let's get to it.
1953000	1956000	Zach's like, I've got a really spooky segment for you guys.
1957000	1961000	The bathroom is on the way to Ty's office, so Beck just kind of taps on the door.
1961000	1965000	Hey, Cal, we're being called to the big man's office.
1965000	1968000	Oh, okay, well, just give me a minute.
1969000	1972000	I got some coffee on my tie.
1972000	1976000	If you need a tissue to get the coffee out, I mean, uh, I got one.
1976000	1978000	A hand just pops out from like the door.
1978000	1982000	He does, in one of his cargo shorts, have a little travel thing of tissues.
1982000	1983000	You just hear...
1985000	1987000	as he blows his nose.
1987000	1988000	All right, see you in there, man.
1988000	1992000	Well, there's like a deep, deep sigh as he collects himself,
1992000	1997000	and then a smiling, beautiful Cal Colorado pops out,
1997000	2000000	and you might notice his eyes are a little red, but probably not.
2000000	2003000	Probably not. It looks like maybe he applied some makeup in there.
2004000	2006000	Cal, uh, heavy lunch?
2006000	2008000	Are you calling me fat?
2008000	2010000	He runs back into the bathroom.
2014000	2017000	Julius thinks, I just didn't want to call him a crybaby.
2018000	2020000	You gotta learn how to deal with the talent, man.
2021000	2026000	Julius is looking at Beck like, I mean, what do we do?
2026000	2028000	Beck is kind of giving you an open arm shrug.
2028000	2032000	He's a complicated guy. Sometimes you just gotta give him some space.
2032000	2034000	He, like, elbows Beck.
2034000	2036000	He's just, you know, so talented.
2036000	2041000	I don't know why he's, he's, uh, just, he's gotta pee so much, apparently.
2043000	2046000	And then I look at Beck, like, shaking my head, like, was that good?
2051000	2054000	Yeah, Cal hears all that and, like, flushes the toilet,
2054000	2055000	but then immediately comes out.
2055000	2058000	As soon as you pop out, Vivica Johnston, the editor,
2058000	2063000	pops her head out of the bay and looks out to you and says, Cal!
2063000	2065000	She points at Julius.
2066000	2069000	You got a really good one. He's not a Marvin, alright?
2069000	2073000	Cal's head is clearly elsewhere, but he, he kind of blinks and collects himself
2073000	2078000	and looks over at her and, like, gives her a thumbs up and, and pats Julius on the back.
2078000	2082000	Julius really appreciates that, because he's grown up knowing who Marvin is,
2082000	2087000	and he knows that as his last act, he had the marbles torn up from the walkway.
2091000	2094000	Marvin is the only person, Marvin slipped.
2094000	2097000	Yeah, he's the only person that had managed to slip on the marbles.
2097000	2102000	After, after, like, 15 years at the station, he slips on his last day.
2102000	2105000	Everybody thought it was pretty suspicious.
2105000	2110000	But Marvin is suing the studio and the network because of those fucking marbles.
2110000	2112000	Holy shit.
2112000	2116000	Hearing that I'm not like him is awesome, but Julius already knew it.
2116000	2123000	Before you can even, like, look back, Vivica is, uh, very much headphones on, back to click clacking.
2123000	2125000	Vivica is a professional.
2125000	2130000	Julius didn't know where the editing bay was, but he definitely knows where his uncle's office is,
2130000	2133000	because he's been gone there for a long time.
2133000	2135000	Awesome. Well, but also the fun thing is that now he does know.
2135000	2137000	That's true. He's learning.
2137000	2138000	He learned today.
2139000	2141000	On the job training.
2141000	2144000	So as you guys are making your way up there, uh, you do pass.
2144000	2146000	You're making our way up there.
2146000	2148000	Walking past.
2148000	2152000	Walking past the anchor weather person in the sports guy.
2152000	2155000	This is my uncle.
2155000	2156000	We're gonna talk to him.
2156000	2158000	Alright, and they're, uh, they're chilling at Crafty.
2158000	2163000	They're, uh, they're hanging out and just shooting the shit over some bagels.
2163000	2164000	At Crafty?
2164000	2165000	At the Craft Service.
2165000	2166000	Craft Services, bruh.
2166000	2167000	Yeah, I knew what he meant.
2167000	2170000	It's locks, but it's not smoked.
2170000	2173000	We're hanging out at K-Town.
2173000	2175000	Craft Services is provided by Craft.
2175000	2176000	It's sponsored by Craft.
2176000	2181000	There's a vat of macaroni and cheese.
2181000	2183000	Little smokies wrapped in singles.
2183000	2185000	Little smokies and mac and cheese.
2185000	2190000	There's one of those big wooden planks, like you would put a really nice charcuterie board on,
2190000	2193000	but it's just got a shitload of Craft singles on it.
2193000	2199000	Listen, I don't know what you guys have, you know, have planned for my next birthday.
2199000	2201000	Do you want to go to the Springfield Underground to look at the cheese?
2201000	2203000	And eat a charcuterie board of Craft?
2203000	2207000	Yes, I do.
2207000	2213000	As you, uh, are gonna pass them, they, uh, are kind of snickering and whispering.
2213000	2221000	You hear Isabella Kaya, who's the head anchor now at Cannes, who took over for Cal Colorado, and she...
2221000	2222000	We were co-anchors for...
2222000	2223000	Oh!
2223000	2224000	Two and a half years.
2224000	2225000	Nice.
2225000	2227000	I mean, bummer, but nice.
2227000	2229000	And now there's not another co-anchor.
2229000	2230000	She is just the lead.
2230000	2231000	Nope, she has got it.
2231000	2232000	And...
2232000	2233000	Fool!
2233000	2234000	Yeah.
2234000	2238000	She really reminded Cal of his daughter, Carol.
2238000	2243000	He thought he had taken her under his wing and really, like, mentored this person.
2243000	2244000	Yeah.
2244000	2250000	And it wasn't her decision to swap out the anchor spots, but Cal lost a lot.
2250000	2255000	On her first day as a solo anchor, she said, well, now over to me.
2255000	2261000	And then did the next story.
2261000	2269000	And as you guys are walking up the stairs on the way to Taif Raylan's office, she calls up after you.
2269000	2270000	Oh, Cal!
2270000	2273000	I heard you did a wonderful job on your farmer segment.
2273000	2278000	Well, not only did I do a wonderful job, but my team here did a wonderful job.
2278000	2281000	As you look at your team, you're kind of, like, beaming with pride.
2281000	2286000	As you look back, her back is turned, and she is talking with the others.
2286000	2295000	It doesn't really go with his methods or preferences, but the viewer discretion, like, stab, then...
2295000	2296000	Julius.
2296000	2297000	Julius added.
2297000	2307000	He's pretty confident that she's going to open her soda when she sees that.
2307000	2310000	Oh, she's going to open her soda, all right.
2310000	2312000	Can you cut that into something?
2312000	2314000	Should I say it all again?
2314000	2324000	He may not like the sensationalism, but he knows that Julius' crab people stab and content warning is definitely going to, like, get some eyes.
2324000	2325000	Classic crab stab.
2325000	2329000	He just says, yeah, you have a good one too, Isabella.
2329000	2333000	When Beck sees that her back is already turned, he's flipping her off.
2333000	2336000	But you made sure to wait until she was all the way turned around.
2336000	2338000	Cal is like, Beck.
2338000	2339000	Sorry, man.
2339000	2341000	But fuck her, dude.
2341000	2347000	Cal is like, I may have to go to HR after my meeting with Typh.
2347000	2350000	I think he said he wanted to butt fuck her.
2350000	2355000	That is not appropriate.
2355000	2362000	Jesus fucking Christ.
2362000	2367000	You guys head up the stairs to Typh Raylan's office.
2367000	2374000	It is double-doored and Typh's door is closed.
2374000	2384000	You knock on the thick oak doors that have glass on both sides of them so you can actually see, like, fully into his office.
2384000	2392000	But these huge wooden doors are installed so that you understand what kind of office you're about to walk into.
2392000	2395000	What was that knock?
2395000	2397000	And is that the secret family knock?
2397000	2400000	Oh, is that the Raylan knock?
2400000	2405000	Will you cut this out later and send it to me so that I can say yes and know what it is?
2405000	2409000	What is it?
2409000	2410000	Hold on.
2410000	2411000	What's happening?
2411000	2412000	That's it, yeah.
2412000	2414000	Is it State Farm?
2414000	2416000	Not quite that.
2416000	2419000	Anyway.
2419000	2424000	Yeah, it's exactly that.
2424000	2428000	You can switch it up to, we are farmers.
2428000	2432000	Oh, that's what we're thinking of.
2432000	2435000	State Farm.
2435000	2439000	We are State Farm. Liberty, Liberty, Liberty.
2439000	2444000	Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
2444000	2447000	Affleck.
2447000	2450000	Dude, Affleck doesn't cob knock.
2450000	2456000	You just start pounding on his door and screaming, insurance, insurance.
2457000	2463000	He knows the knock.
2463000	2466000	It was all of that.
2466000	2468000	It was all of that.
2468000	2469000	Oh, no.
2469000	2475000	You heard from the other side of the door him singing along.
2475000	2476000	Holy shit.
2476000	2482000	And once you heard Affleck, you hear him go, Affleck.
2482000	2484000	You may enter.
2484000	2494000	As soon as I hear him kind of respond from inside, first thing, hey, uncle, from now on, how about you'll just know it's me?
2494000	2495000	What do you mean?
2495000	2498000	Like, just maybe one of like, and then it's me?
2498000	2499000	Oh, come on.
2499000	2500000	You don't do the whole knock.
2500000	2501000	You're not a real Rayland.
2501000	2502000	That's what we say, right?
2502000	2508000	And you want to be a real Rayland and he's literally putting his fingers in your gut and like poking you.
2508000	2512000	Mr. Rayland, could I just say that your nephew here has just performed.
2512000	2513000	Yeah, come on, come on.
2513000	2514000	Sit down, sit down.
2514000	2515000	Hey, come on.
2515000	2516000	I'm so glad that you're here, Cal.
2516000	2517000	Yeah, come on.
2517000	2518000	Sit down.
2518000	2519000	Thank you.
2519000	2520000	You were saying?
2520000	2524000	I was saying that your nephew has performed admirably on his first assignment and that,
2524000	2527000	you know, honestly, the whole office is talking about this.
2527000	2533000	Since you can see us through the glass, do we need these crazy knocks?
2533000	2534000	He thinks about it.
2534000	2539000	He's beaming with pride while he's staring at Julius and he's like, do we need the crazy knocks?
2539000	2540000	I don't know.
2540000	2542000	Do I need to give my little nephew a hug?
2542000	2543000	Yes, I do.
2543000	2545000	Come here, baby.
2545000	2546000	Happily, Julius.
2546000	2547000	You did a good job.
2547000	2552000	He goes from very sad thinking about the last name situation and then gives his uncle a big ol' hug.
2552000	2555000	Wait, it's the last name situation that you don't have the same last name?
2555000	2556000	Summers.
2556000	2557000	That is correct.
2557000	2558000	Julius Summers.
2558000	2559000	I mean, you're a nephew.
2559000	2560000	Couldn't you just be his sister's son?
2560000	2562000	I am his sister's son.
2562000	2563000	Whoa.
2563000	2565000	Mystery solved.
2565000	2569000	You already used luck, so that should get a point back.
2569000	2570000	You nailed it.
2570000	2573000	Yeah, I'm sorry, but did I not just deduce the fuck out of that?
2573000	2574000	He just deduced the fuck out of that.
2574000	2576000	He forgot Luke's character's last name.
2576000	2579000	Oh, you must be his sister's son.
2579000	2582000	Yeah, it's not weird that I have a different last name.
2582000	2584000	It's just the fact that I do have a different last name.
2584000	2588000	He lifts Julius off the ground and he's like, I'm so proud of you.
2588000	2592000	On your second day, you're getting big ups from the great cow Colorado.
2592000	2594000	He gives you knocks, Beck.
2594000	2597000	Beck is kind of getting stoked just off of his stokedness.
2597000	2598000	Yeah.
2598000	2600000	He enthusiastically knuckles back.
2600000	2603000	Now, I got something, ooh, I got something weird.
2603000	2605000	I got something weird, okay?
2605000	2609000	It's not normal, yeah, it's not normal, okay, but it's for Cal.
2609000	2611000	Hmm, how do I say this?
2611000	2619000	A woman called in, yeah, and she said that she's got a hot heater of a story.
2619000	2621000	Yeah, all right, okay?
2621000	2627000	But she won't talk to anyone, no one, except Cal Colorado.
2627000	2628000	So we got to send you out.
2628000	2631000	And she said it's urgent, so we have to go right now.
2631000	2633000	Before the broadcast even starts, yeah?
2633000	2638000	Typh, I know it's been a while since I've been in the anchor chair,
2638000	2642000	but typically, these are just women looking to sexually harass me.
2642000	2647000	Hmm, so I'm sorry to hear that, but in this situation,
2647000	2650000	she really seems like she's got something.
2650000	2653000	She said she had a hot story just for Cal.
2653000	2656000	Okay, what she said was that she can't call the cops,
2656000	2660000	and that if we can get in there and get the story first, you see,
2660000	2665000	then maybe we can run it before anybody else.
2665000	2667000	What do you guys think about this?
2667000	2670000	We go, if the story's true, we get good content.
2670000	2676000	If it's false, we spin it into exposing the perverts of the city.
2676000	2681000	Ooh, my man's got a mind on him, yeah, my man's got a good brain.
2681000	2685000	I mean, we'd be kind of like using Cal as bait in that case,
2685000	2687000	but it sounds like a story to me.
2687000	2690000	I've never seen such good-looking bait in my life, look at him!
2690000	2692000	Oh, he's perfect, yeah?
2692000	2697000	If you didn't have those beautiful blue eyes, I wouldn't even suggest it.
2697000	2700000	And I look at Bag like, is it working, is it working?
2700000	2703000	Turn the thing down, put it in reverse.
2708000	2710000	Gentlemen, this is not journalism.
2711000	2713000	It's almost something more than that.
2718000	2723000	I got chills, I got chills, I got spinglies in the back of my tingle.
2723000	2726000	Cal got chills too, but in a bad way.
2726000	2730000	Oh, come on, let's go. Let's go, Cal, what do you want?
2730000	2732000	What do you want? What can I do for you?
2732000	2735000	He's looking confused at Julius and he's like,
2735000	2738000	what more is there than journalism?
2738000	2740000	It's the human condition.
2740000	2745000	Yeah, you can get a story out of anything if you're smart enough like my man here.
2745000	2746000	Is the story true?
2746000	2748000	There's only one way to find out.
2748000	2753000	And if it's not, like Julius said, that's the story.
2753000	2759000	You know, what this makes me think of is you see these and he gestures to his thighs.
2759000	2764000	Sometimes I squeeze watermelons and I squeeze them so hard
2764000	2769000	that the juice comes out of every part of that watermelon down to the last drop.
2769000	2775000	And what we need to do is be my thighs and squeeze a story out of this phone call.
2776000	2780000	I feel like the risk-reward here is pretty high.
2780000	2784000	If she does have something juicy, we need a good story.
2784000	2789000	So either she has something juicy or I'm the something juicy.
2794000	2798000	It sounded like she was in a real situation, okay?
2798000	2804000	Ty, if you told me when I switched from news desk to field reporter
2804000	2808000	that if I did things well, points would be earned.
2808000	2809000	Yeah.
2809000	2812000	Points that would maybe get me back to my desk.
2812000	2817000	Yeah, 100. This is a lot of points.
2817000	2822000	If you hold up your end of the bargain, I will do this thing for you.
2822000	2823000	He reaches out his hand.
2823000	2825000	Is he going for a fist bump or a handshake?
2825000	2828000	Oh, it's definitely a fist bump.
2828000	2831000	Cal reaches out for a handshake and then awkwardly goes for a fist bump.
2831000	2835000	As he awkwardly goes for a handshake on your fist.
2835000	2837000	And no hands are shook and no deal is actually made.
2837000	2841000	He grabs your fist and is like, yeah, now we're talking.
2841000	2842000	Okay, boys.
2842000	2843000	Bec grabs both their hands.
2843000	2845000	Get your hand in here, Julius.
2845000	2846000	Get your hand in here.
2846000	2849000	He's like texting with one hand and touching the hand.
2849000	2855000	Can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can, can.
2855000	2856000	Whoa.
2856000	2858000	Becca's jumping up and down.
2858000	2859000	Yeah, do you feel it?
2859000	2860000	Okay, let's go.
2860000	2864000	And he slams a piece of paper down on the desk which has an address on it.
2864000	2867000	Cal salutes you and says, can, can.
2867000	2868000	Skrrr.
2868000	2874000	We see the can van slide out of its parking spot in the can parking lot.
2874000	2878000	And you see we have all ran to the can van.
2879000	2883000	The, the can van peels out of the parking lot with no one in it.
2883000	2885000	As you guys chase after it.
2888000	2889000	What?
2890000	2893000	Uh, I, okay, now we've got a mystery for season two.
2893000	2894000	Yeah.
2895000	2902000	Can I ask, uh, in character, does Cal know why he was demoted to field anchor?
2902000	2903000	Yes.
2903000	2904000	Okay.
2904000	2906000	And then out of character, do you have something already?
2906000	2907000	Yes.
2907000	2908000	Cool.
2908000	2909000	And how long has it been since that?
2909000	2910000	Six months.
2910000	2911000	I didn't mean to derail us.
2911000	2914000	You were on a mission there getting us to an end place.
2914000	2915000	You're so good at that Joe.
2915000	2916000	I just was curious.
2916000	2918000	You're the one, you're always the one doing it.
2918000	2921000	It's not, it's not me or Luke.
2921000	2922000	It's you.
2922000	2923000	It's you.
2923000	2924000	It's you.
2924000	2926000	I want to have a baby with you.
2926000	2927000	I want to have a baby with you.
2927000	2929000	I want to get pregnant.
2932000	2934000	I want to get pregnant with you.
2934000	2936000	Jesus Christ.
2938000	2939000	Oh man.
2939000	2940000	All right.
2940000	2941000	Call him.
2941000	2942000	What were we talking about?
2942000	2943000	That's all it was.
2943000	2946000	Cause I wondered if there was a chance that Cal didn't even know, but he's been told that
2946000	2948000	he's done now on a good point system to get back.
2948000	2952000	I didn't know if that was something that you didn't know what you were trying to redeem
2952000	2953000	yourself for yet or not.
2953000	2955000	No, he knows what he's redeeming himself for.
2955000	2958000	I think the point system is probably pretty amorphous and fluid.
2958000	2959000	Sure.
2959000	2961000	Um, and is just a scam.
2961000	2962000	Oh, you're maybe not real.
2962000	2963000	Exactly.
2963000	2964000	Yeah.
2964000	2968000	Like would he take this unscrupulous job to get back to his dream job?
2968000	2969000	Yeah.
2969000	2974000	He's never seen any part of working at can as unscrupulous and he's not, maybe it's just
2974000	2979000	been so long since he's been in the field, but he didn't even realize how like down and
2979000	2982000	dirty, maybe typhon is his field boys were getting.
2982000	2983000	Oh yeah.
2983000	2992000	Then pulls out onto one of the perfectly gridlocked, perfectly perpendicular roads of the city.
2992000	2994000	And immediately you're stuck in traffic.
2994000	2997000	You get a text from typh.
2997000	3002000	It just says, I ain't seen no tick tock yet.
3002000	3003000	Oh fuck.
3003000	3005000	That's what it was.
3005000	3006000	That is wow.
3006000	3007000	Like, God damn it.
3007000	3009000	You totally did say that.
3009000	3011000	You said that?
3011000	3017000	Cal hasn't read that text yet, but Thomas's heart just sank.
3017000	3019000	Really good timing to bring it up.
3019000	3025000	How do you break it to Cal who is clearly playing candy crush on his phone and hasn't
3025000	3026000	seen the text?
3026000	3031000	Well, since we're stuck here in traffic, uh, we might as well do some man on the street.
3031000	3041000	Sorry that you were going to say tick tock for tick tock.
3042000	3049000	Do you hand your phone to Beck?
3049000	3050000	Yes.
3050000	3052000	It's already logged in.
3052000	3055000	I'm logged into the can talk.
3055000	3057000	I'm talking to Cal.
3057000	3062000	This, this thing that they've been trying out here, it's like to get younger viewers
3062000	3064000	engaged more or something.
3064000	3068000	Like I'm not big on it myself, but I understand it.
3068000	3071000	Have you ever like, um, popped and locked?
3071000	3072000	I'm sorry.
3072000	3075000	Are you asking me if I've committed a robbery?
3075000	3076000	No.
3076000	3081000	Um, and he turns to Julius, if he like patted his head and rubbed his belly, is that like
3081000	3082000	a challenge?
3082000	3083000	You know?
3098000	3110000	I love everything we've done so far.
3110000	3113000	This is not like any role playing we've ever done before.
3113000	3114000	I think it's good.
3114000	3115000	Um, yeah.
3115000	3116000	I like it.
3116000	3117000	Me too.
3117000	3119000	You guys are like supporting each other and shit.
3119000	3123000	It's wild.
3124000	3128000	The hardest part of waking up is deciding what to wear.
3128000	3134000	But today I woke up missing me and it's been downhill from there.
3136000	3138000	One, two, three, four!
3145000	3148000	Why don't you tell me what you think of me?
3148000	3151000	Cause I don't really think of you.
3151000	3153000	I don't recognize myself.
3153000	3157000	What you did was a stinky thing to do.
3157000	3160000	No cure for being freaking stupid.
3160000	3163000	So take it or leave it.
3163000	3169000	Cause it's not getting any better, better, better, better, better, better, better, better!
3169000	3171000	This is my coming of age.
3171000	3175000	This train don't have no brakes.
3175000	3176000	That's too bad.
3176000	3177000	That's my least favorite time.
3177000	3181000	Have a happy birthday old friend.
3181000	3188000	I hope this isn't the end but if it is, it'll be alright.
3188000	3197000	Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.
3197000	3206000	Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.
3207000	3216000	I don't need you to apologize.
3216000	3219000	I just need you to fix it.
3219000	3222000	I'm sick of waiting on someone to wait on me.
3222000	3225000	Cause last time I missed it.
3225000	3227000	If you tell me to get over it.
3227000	3230000	It's not your business.
3230000	3234000	I'll skip away into the sunset and whistle to the tune of it.
3234000	3240000	This is my coming of age.
3240000	3246000	This train don't have no brakes.
3246000	3250000	Have a happy birthday old friend.
3250000	3253000	I hope this isn't the end.
3253000	3258000	It'll finally be alright.
3258000	3267000	Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.
3267000	3281000	Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.
3281000	3290000	Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.
3303000	3306000	Today I woke up missing me.
3306000	3309000	I forgot her yesterday.
3309000	3314000	Where I left my made up enemies and this song was not a thing.
3314000	3318000	And the truth is this is 100% real.
3318000	3325000	Cause my life is wonderful and I blame it on me.
