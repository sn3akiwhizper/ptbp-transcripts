0	5760	Greetings, greetings, my fellow canines, my pups, my pack.
5760	14720	You are listening to 694.2 PTBP, Contentions best radio show hosted by Wolf the dog.
14720	15720	That's me baby.
15720	21560	I'd like to introduce a brand new segment today, and we're gonna call it Howlin' with
21560	22600	Wolf.
22600	26360	If you listeners out there would like any of your announcements read on air each week
26360	31820	by yours truly, I had to read anything these people send me.
31820	35400	Apparently yes, it can be anything.
35400	40440	Tell me your thoughts about what them boys are up to, promote your new business, tell
40440	45840	your best friend Becky that she's really been nailing it lately, or just go ahead and say
45840	48560	hi to your best pal Wolf.
48560	52960	Okay well, then you can enter up to four times by doing one of the following.
52960	57800	One, leave us a five star review on your podcast platform of choice.
57800	65800	Two, three, and four, make a post and tag us on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter.
65800	71800	You can find us on Instagram and Twitter at pretending pod or look up pretending to be
71800	74540	people on Facebook.
74540	76800	Eat my ass Mark Zuckerberg.
76800	81220	Nah, each time you do one of these we'll put your name in a bowl.
81220	85780	Each week me or one of my minions will draw a name and that person will be able to write
85780	91900	an announcement to be read by your local canine DJ Wolf the dog.
91900	96660	Now I'm just gonna let y'all know my producer told me to read all that, but what the fuck
96660	98560	is a podcast?
98560	105920	Now for a little news, says right here them boys done fucked up.
105920	109300	Now speaking of fucked up, we got a banger for y'all today.
109300	113100	It's kazoo with no backbone.
139300	167300	Oh, come on, it's all about the build up.
167300	172380	Wow, enough of that.
172380	187780	So that song plays over the drone shot of you all of us crying and then we would see
187780	196220	one police cruiser and a raggedy four wheeler come pulling back into the contention police
196220	203300	department parking lot and the three of you go inside.
203300	207100	Well we're back in the police station.
207100	212340	Can I first aid myself to see if I can set my foot back in and strap that boot back on
212340	213620	and just leave it be?
213620	215860	Let's drop you off at the hospital.
215860	217300	Let's get professional medical attention.
217300	219980	I kind of like the idea of me doing it.
219980	220980	What do you want to do Keith?
220980	225940	I want to just see if I can't set it back in where I think it might be and then wrap
225940	229540	it up and then put my boot back on and then just go from there.
229540	232700	Go ahead and roll a first aid for me.
232700	233700	That's a nine.
233700	234780	You nailed it.
234780	242100	With an actual first aid kit handy and perhaps a leather strap to bite down on, you set your
242100	245380	ankle back into place and get your boot back on.
245380	248020	I think Clark is real disturbed.
248020	250020	We would have just taken you to the hospital man.
250020	251020	We don't have time.
251020	252700	Let's get, let's do some more investigating.
252700	253700	Oh, all right.
253700	255340	I have to prove myself dude.
255340	256900	Is he losing hit points or anything?
256900	258380	I gain hit points from that probably.
258380	260980	Yeah, you do actually roll a D4 for me.
260980	261980	Oh yeah.
261980	262980	Come on baby.
262980	263980	Two.
263980	266260	Yeah, go ahead and grab two hit points.
266260	267460	What is your first aid Luke?
267460	268460	60.
268460	269640	Oh nice.
269640	270640	He said 60.
270640	273060	It's qualified.
273060	279900	And as you guys are sitting around, Drew says, oh, by the way, I meant to tell you guys,
279900	287660	I called in and checked with the city PD about the death of Jim Cook, Maggie's dad.
287660	291220	It's pretty brutal actually.
291220	297020	He was murdered in an alleyway the night of December 1st.
297020	300980	He was strangled and died of asphyxiation.
300980	303740	Didn't you say you had a dream about an alleyway?
303740	305580	As a matter of fact, I did.
305580	308780	And you had a dream about an old woman strangling people?
308780	310020	No, not an old woman.
310020	314660	She was an old timey lady throwing me through the floor.
314660	316180	Even spookier.
316180	322860	And did I see you guys pull up in that four wheeler, but did someone wreck the four wheeler?
322860	324180	Yeah, I did.
324180	326260	Yeah, I wrecked it.
326260	328340	It was bad ass though.
328340	332100	Right guys?
332100	333620	Just could you take a look at that?
333620	334620	Yeah.
334620	335620	You know mechanical stuff, right?
335620	336620	Yeah, absolutely.
336620	337620	I'll take a look at it.
337620	343220	And then now that Julie Maxwell is definitely not at her apartment, maybe we should go take
343220	344220	a look at that.
344220	345220	Do all three of you want to go?
345220	346220	Yeah, I think so.
346220	347220	Sure.
347220	355400	I think it's best we stick together because if any of us got into this kind of trouble
355400	360500	without people to help, I'm like...
360500	367300	Okay so you get the address off of her ID that John Pettymore got a hold of when she
367300	369220	was in her car accident.
369220	374900	You head there and you pull up to a quadplex in the shitty neighborhood just northwest of
374900	378980	downtown where Julie Maxwell rents a studio apartment.
378980	383820	There's a sticky note on her door and I will hand it to you now.
383820	386980	I just got a dick drawn on it.
386980	387980	That's strange.
387980	388980	What's it say?
388980	389980	You weren't here.
389980	390980	Still waiting for reply.
390980	392260	Please help me.
392260	395860	You know I've always thought it was weird that this place is called the shitty neighborhood.
395860	401280	I feel like step one to raising property values in this place is changing that name.
401280	402460	I knock on the door.
402460	408940	As you knock on the door, the door opens and an odd chemical scent wafts out the door.
408940	410580	Do I recognize this chemical?
410580	412300	It opens from the power of his knock.
412300	415620	Yeah, it was just clearly not closed very well.
415620	417260	Is it like methy in here?
417260	418260	Or like bleach?
418260	420220	Yeah, a little bleach-y.
420220	421220	Not so methy.
421220	424780	A scent that John would know pretty well I bet.
424780	431200	As you go inside, you find a bed, a desk with an old computer on it, and a large number
431200	434740	of complete and incomplete taxidermied animals.
434740	440020	Looking around further, you see an empty bottle of brandy, an old digital camera, taxidermy
440020	446700	materials like tanning chemicals, pickling agents, bactericides, oils and such, a handful
446700	452660	of pictures of Julie with her sister Ashley from before the accident, and a receipt from
452660	455580	Forgotten Treasures, a local flea market.
455580	458660	Whoever has the best search, please roll search for me.
458660	459660	I've got 50.
459660	461660	Yeah, you're the best.
461660	463080	32.
463080	468100	As you are giving the apartment a quick go around, you find a phone book.
468100	472100	It's flipped upside down underneath the bed, and flipping it over, you see the phone book
472100	479100	was opened to the Yellow Pages for private practices, and Circled is an ad for Dr. Marie
479100	482340	Jacobs, who is a family practitioner in contention.
482340	484540	Hey John, you should take a look at that computer.
484540	485540	Yeah, definitely.
485540	487860	I want to look at that camera and that receipt too.
487860	488860	Okay.
488860	490420	Roll computer science.
490420	491420	96.
491420	492420	Well.
492420	495980	My skill is 99, so I pass hand on it.
495980	496980	It's awfully handy.
496980	500540	You would see that the digital camera is broken that's sitting on the desk.
500540	501620	Damn, it's broken.
501620	507260	There are some recent Google searches on her computer for fixing broken digital cameras,
507300	510060	and then moving on to where to find a new camera.
510060	511940	She was looking into buying a new camera.
511940	518980	The receipt from Forgotten Treasures is off an old register for, I don't know, $45.
518980	521460	Let's go with $45.
521460	524260	I also, before I move on to the camera, I'm going to pocket that memory card.
524260	525260	Sounds good.
525260	529140	Is there any memory card reader or input on the computer?
529140	530140	Sure.
530140	532660	I would like to see if I can see anything on it.
532660	535220	A bunch of pictures of taxidermied animals.
535220	539660	Can I spend the next four hours here trying to complete some of these unassembled taxidermies
539660	541980	and really grind my taxidermy skill?
541980	542980	Absolutely.
542980	543980	Sweet.
543980	544980	What is the mattress memory for?
544980	547820	A little progress bar appears above my head as I just...
547820	548820	Learn.
548820	549820	Yeah, just stand.
549820	550820	Is this just a one bedroom?
550820	551820	Yeah.
551820	554580	Does Clark know anything about Dr. Marie Jacobs just from being in the town?
554580	556540	I don't think so.
556540	557860	Any pictures or anything around?
557860	558860	Oh yeah.
558860	562980	They're all of Julie with her sister Ashley, so they're all from high school.
562980	564020	Move on, you know?
564020	565020	She is now.
565020	566020	Thanks to Clark.
566020	569060	Hey Clark, how do you feel about being in the home of the woman you brutally murdered
569060	570060	yesterday?
570060	571060	I mean, she murdered first.
571060	572060	Hell yeah.
572060	573060	All right, for an eye.
573060	574060	Literally.
574060	575060	Literally.
575060	576140	Can you think of anything else to do in here?
576140	580620	Clark is real interested in the taxidermy from a fan of taxidermy standpoint.
580620	581620	Awesome.
581620	585680	Guys, look at the scenes.
585680	591100	The whole time that John and Keith are looking through stuff and trying to work on the computer,
591100	592100	you're just...
592100	593100	Admiring the craft work.
593100	594100	Wonderful.
594180	595180	Good.
595180	600860	Are there any deer heads in here that you could wear as like a funny prank or a disguise
600860	601860	in the woods?
601860	602860	Oh dude, yeah.
602860	603860	Could we disguise ourselves?
603860	607540	Is there enough deer components here for us to make deer disguises?
607540	611920	I think you could probably come up with a headdress of some sort if you really took
611920	612920	the time.
612920	613920	I take the time.
613920	614920	Yeah, actually.
614920	618420	It seems like we're dealing with some spooky shit, so we're going to spook right back.
618420	619420	Okay, perfect.
619420	622980	You guys can spend some time in here- Making three deer headdresses?
622980	626780	Yeah, I mean if that's what you want to do- Well, I want a deer, do you guys want anything
626780	627780	else?
627780	628780	Ooh, yeah.
628780	629780	Is there like a boar?
629780	630780	Yeah, there's for sure a boar in here.
630780	631780	What about a bobcat?
631780	633700	There are three bobcat heads.
633700	634700	What do you want to be, Clark?
634700	637260	I am not participating.
637260	641180	I make like a bobcat Cerberus.
641180	643660	I'm just going to go with a deer.
643660	646420	Clark, how are you reacting to them doing this?
646420	651780	I would not let it happen, but I don't know if Thomas and Luke will not let me let it
651780	652780	happen.
653580	656700	Listen, Clark.
656700	657700	We've seen some shit.
657700	658700	What the fuck?
658700	660700	You guys are putting shit on your heads.
660700	661700	I know.
661700	662700	Act like officers, boys.
662700	663700	Hey, you know what?
663700	669220	There's officers of man's law, and there's officers of spooky law.
669220	673500	I go and take it off of your head, off of Jon's head, and just put it back on the table.
673500	674500	We don't need this stuff.
674500	680140	I have ahold of the deer antlers with my mask, and I say, you're not fucking touching me,
680140	681140	Clark.
681180	684060	It's a weird call to just set mine on the table, because I just pick it back up and
684060	685420	walk out with it under my arm.
685420	688580	I roll out of the apartment with my deer mask on.
688580	693580	Clark, you are standing in the middle of the apartment of the woman you killed, and your
693580	697580	two fellow officers have walked out with taxidermy hats.
697580	699900	Sorry, one was a Cerberus.
699900	705480	Well, it was a hat, but it's a spooky three-headed bobcat mask.
705480	706480	How you feeling?
706480	707480	Not great.
707480	711440	I think madness has taken my friends.
711440	712440	Yeah.
712440	716880	I'm okay if you want to throw a sanity roll at us for that decision we just made.
716880	717880	No, you're good.
717880	718880	All right.
718880	720440	Let's take that memory card and camera with us.
720440	721440	I'll take that tray for a sweet bobcat.
721440	722440	Wait, what kind of camera?
722440	724120	What kind of camera was it?
724120	730700	Remember before we had iPhones, and we all, a bunch of people had digital cameras that
730700	732900	were about the size of an ID.
732900	734160	What are you, a grandpa?
734160	735160	It was one of those.
735160	736360	Yes, my children have children.
736360	741640	I want to take a picture of the apartment with it and see if it just takes a picture
741640	742640	of the apartment.
742640	743640	He said it's broken.
743640	744640	Oh, it's broken.
744640	745640	Well, darn.
745640	748140	Let's take it back to Drew and see if he can fix it.
748140	749440	We got the card off it.
749440	750440	Yeah, that's true.
750440	754040	Yeah, so unless you want a digital camera from 2008-
754040	755040	I don't.
755040	757440	Okay, what should we do next, boys?
757440	759440	I kind of got caught up in that bobcat mask thing.
759440	760960	What was on the SD card?
760960	763520	It was pictures of the finished taxidermy.
763520	764520	Right, okay.
764520	770280	I think you figured out earlier in this game that she is a taxidermist, and so it's her
770280	771280	Etsy page.
771280	772280	Yeah, nope.
772280	773280	Chuck Testa.
773280	774280	Sweet meme.
774280	775280	Oh, yeah, vintage.
775280	776280	Vintage memes.
776280	777280	What are you, a grandpa?
777280	778280	What?
778280	780280	Yeah, his kids have kids.
780280	781280	Pictures.
781280	783840	We got two things we could go and look at here now.
783840	789120	We can see if anybody at Forgotten Treasures remembers what she bought, and we could head
789120	792320	over to the doctor's office and see if she has any information on why-
792440	793920	Let's go to Hidden Treasures.
793920	794920	Or Forgotten Treasures.
794920	795920	Forgotten Treasures.
795920	796920	Forgotten Treasures.
796920	797920	Let's go there.
801920	805180	All right, so you guys roll up to Forgotten Treasures.
805180	812400	It is in the old neighborhood, two blocks west of, it's, no, it's, yeah, to the left.
812400	813400	It's right there.
813400	814400	Yep.
814400	816640	And it's an antique flea market.
816640	821040	For people who don't know that we have a map, it sounds like you said to the left.
821040	822040	Yep, there it is.
823040	831320	We just go out on the balcony of Julie's, and the poor looking, no, no, oh.
831320	832320	Just above that.
832320	833320	Just to the left.
833320	834320	There you go.
834320	835320	You got it.
835320	836320	You found it.
836320	837320	To the left.
837320	838320	To the left.
838320	839320	All your shit in a box in the flea market.
839320	843760	Okay, so you guys pull up, and it's almost closing time.
843760	846760	Not for cops.
846760	847760	I'm pretty much, yeah.
847760	849000	What do you guys want to do?
849000	850000	Go inside.
850000	851160	Okay, you go inside.
851160	852160	You know what?
852160	853160	That's what they're expecting.
853160	856160	No, I don't have a better point.
856160	862220	Okay, so you guys go inside Forgotten Treasures, and at the front, there seems to be a sort
862220	863640	of office to your right.
863640	867500	There's a big register area to the left where everybody checks out.
867500	873200	There's one big register sitting on it, and an old woman standing behind it.
873200	879880	And then looking forward, you just see a bunch of different rows of booths, individual booths.
879880	882680	It smells kind of weird in here.
882680	884000	Like old stuff.
884000	885000	Cool.
885000	887920	Wait, so do we have ... We have a receipt from here?
887920	888920	What was on the receipt?
888920	889920	$45.
889920	890920	It wasn't itemized.
890920	893520	Okay, let's go up and talk to this lady and see if she remembers.
893520	895480	Yeah, see if Julie came by a lot.
895480	896480	Hello, ma'am.
896480	897480	Hello?
897480	898480	Hi?
898480	901480	We're three officers of the law, and we need some information from you.
901480	902480	Oh my.
902480	903480	Okay.
903480	904480	Sure.
904480	905480	Yes?
905480	906480	Do you remember a lady named Julie Maxwell?
906480	907480	Julie Maxwell?
907480	908480	No.
908480	909480	Pull up a picture.
910080	911080	Yeah.
911080	912080	We show her a picture.
912080	913080	Oh, yes.
913080	914080	Yes.
914080	916320	She was in here, I don't know, maybe a week ago.
916320	919720	Was she a frequent customer or just the one time?
919720	920720	No.
920720	921720	Do you recall what she purchased?
921720	922720	Oh gosh.
922720	924720	Oh gosh, what was it?
924720	927720	It was an old camera.
927720	928720	What booth?
928720	929720	504?
929720	930720	I think.
930720	931720	Yeah.
931720	932720	Yeah.
932720	933720	Polaroid?
933720	934720	Seemed to be.
934720	935720	I'd never seen anything like it before.
935720	937600	It was a weird camera.
937600	939280	What kind of things do they sell in this?
939280	941320	As she's saying that, I'm going to head toward it.
941320	945440	As she opens a book and starts flipping through it.
945440	949760	That booth is owned by Mildred Mitchell?
949760	951120	That's John Peters' neighbor.
951120	952720	Clark, you're walking toward the booth.
952720	960440	When you get there, it contains some old hippie records, some tie-dye clothes, and future
960440	961440	paraphernalia.
961440	962440	Future paraphernalia?
962440	963440	Future paraphernalia?
963440	967840	Yeah, like some pipes that will- For tobacco use only.
967840	971320	For tobacco use only.
971320	975960	Are there any other items like that camera or are they all pretty straightforward, nothing
975960	976960	too unusual?
976960	977960	Yeah.
977960	978960	I don't know.
978960	986000	There has been some, I guess, not too many people around here buy stuff from Mildred,
986000	991600	but she had a few items come in pretty recently that all sold pretty quickly.
991600	992600	How recently?
992600	994080	Probably about a week ago.
994080	995960	I think she looted John Peters' house.
995960	996960	We need to go talk to her.
997080	999360	Yeah, we need to find out how she got this stuff.
999360	1001120	Do you have any other cool booths?
1001120	1003600	You might want to check out booth 420.
1003600	1005000	Man, we are officers before war.
1005000	1006720	Man, we're cops.
1006720	1010320	It's all Elvis memorabilia.
1010320	1011320	I'm a big fan.
1011320	1012320	Well.
1012320	1013320	Oh, you old hound dog.
1013320	1014320	Crying all the time.
1014320	1016280	I really want to go talk to Mildred.
1016280	1017280	Let's roll.
1017280	1021960	Let's head right to Mildred's.
1021960	1029560	You guys pull up to Mildred's house and when she opens up the door, a cloud of smoke billows
1029560	1036400	out of the door and she's like, oh, hey, uh, oh, officer, officers, uh, officers.
1036400	1037400	I, uh, oh boy.
1037400	1038400	Hey Mildred.
1038400	1039400	Hey.
1039400	1040400	You having a good time there?
1040400	1041400	Hey Johnny.
1041400	1042400	How are you doing?
1042400	1043400	Uh, yeah.
1043400	1044400	I, um.
1044400	1045400	Not as good as you, I don't think.
1045400	1048160	I'm so, I am, um, I'm sorry.
1048160	1050740	Burning a little incense in here, are we Mildred?
1050740	1053020	I just like the place to smell nice.
1053020	1054020	Of course.
1054020	1056260	Hey, do you mind if we step in and ask you a few questions?
1056260	1057260	I don't know.
1057260	1058260	By all means.
1058260	1059260	Do you want some tea?
1059260	1060940	And she, uh, starts walking back.
1060940	1062300	What kind of tea?
1062300	1069180	I've got green, chamomile, herbal, mint, peppermint, black, uh, blue, and, uh, green.
1069180	1070860	I'll take one of them peppermints, man.
1070860	1072380	I'll take the second green.
1072380	1073940	I'll take the first green.
1073940	1074940	Have some fun, Keith.
1074940	1076260	All right, let's do it.
1076260	1078980	She picks up a spliff off of her ashtray.
1078980	1079980	Mildred.
1080220	1082100	Oh, I, oh, shoot, I'm so-
1082100	1086980	She's, like, embarrassed and puts it out, uh, and then goes back and, uh, comes back
1086980	1090180	with some tea, uh, and sits down on the couch and is like-
1090180	1096100	Oh, no, uh, what, what can I, uh, oh, ew, what can I, uh, do for you, officers?
1096100	1100100	We don't want to go accusing nobody of nothing, Mildred, but, you know, when you noticed John
1100100	1105700	had been missing, did you happen to maybe stock your booth with some of his things?
1105700	1106700	My, my booth?
1106700	1108700	Down at the flea market?
1109700	1116900	I totally forgot I had a booth at the flea market.
1116900	1120940	Somebody restocked it about a week ago, Mildred, with some pretty interesting things.
1120940	1121940	What?
1121940	1125940	No, I, uh, you know, it might have been my granddaughter.
1125940	1129340	I think she might put some stuff for sale there, everyone smile.
1129340	1133860	Hey, uh, Tildy B. Tildy B, come on down here.
1133860	1137060	Uh, she gets an accident when she yells at her granddaughter.
1137420	1142340	A teenage girl, uh, comes down the stairs, and as soon as she, uh, sees three police
1142340	1147300	officers standing in her living room, she bolts back upstairs.
1147300	1148300	What do you do?
1148300	1150700	I call, hey Tildy, now, we just want to talk.
1150700	1151700	I call up the stairs.
1151700	1152700	You hear a door slam?
1152700	1155260	This one's on you, boys, I can't go upstairs.
1155260	1158300	Clark, you go head out the door, I'm gonna make sure she doesn't jump out a window or
1158300	1159300	something.
1159300	1160300	Sure.
1160300	1164460	So John runs around the side of the house and, uh, gets a visual of the windows, and
1164460	1169180	Clark heads upstairs, uh, you are now facing a door that is shut.
1169180	1173860	Hey, Tildy, uh, we're, you're not in trouble, we just, we just need to talk to you about
1173860	1178220	some stuff you might have sold at the, at the booth down at your, your mom's shop down
1178220	1179220	there.
1179220	1181180	Uh, you hear, um, some clanking?
1181180	1182180	Yeah.
1182180	1183180	Clanking.
1183180	1184180	You hear some clanking around.
1184180	1185780	I knock one more time, more forcefully.
1185780	1188300	Tildy, you gotta open up, or I'm gonna open it up.
1188300	1189300	No.
1189300	1190300	No, don't.
1190300	1191300	Alright, step away from the door.
1191300	1192700	I kick in the door.
1192740	1195180	So I'm gonna have the two of you leave.
1195180	1200260	You're gonna have to take a sanity check.
1200260	1201260	She's a deer.
1201260	1208700	She's wearing a three-handed four-hand suit.
1208700	1212940	Clark, you kick in the door, and a teenage girl is standing before you.
1212940	1218780	She has a crazed look in her eyes as she slams a large bullet into the chamber and squeezes
1218780	1223300	the trigger on a really odd-looking revolver.
1223300	1228540	There's an almost blinding flash of light that illuminates your entire field of vision,
1228540	1234420	and then, as if she had never been there, the girl is gone.
1234420	1235420	Roll sanity.
1235420	1236420	Uh, seven.
1236420	1237420	I pass.
1237420	1238420	Okay.
1238420	1241700	Roll, uh, D6 and a half it for me.
1241700	1242700	Three and a half.
1242700	1243700	Two.
1243700	1244700	Call it a two.
1244700	1245700	Alright, so Clark loses two sanity.
1245700	1248220	I am at 52 for the listener at home.
1248220	1259700	You see this odd gun fall to the floor exactly where this young girl stood, frozen in place.
1259700	1268260	You're looking at it, and it's this old revolver, and it's got some glass tubing that runs around
1268260	1269260	the outside of it.
1269260	1270260	What do you want to do?
1270260	1272340	Look in the closet, because she had to have just jumped in there.
1272340	1274020	You creep up to the closet.
1274020	1275020	Gun drawn.
1275020	1277740	The door open, and there's nothing inside.
1277740	1280020	I want to look under that damn bed.
1280020	1281020	Where'd that girl go?
1281020	1285920	You look under the bed, and there's no one underneath the bed.
1285920	1290100	You have absolutely no idea where this girl is gone.
1290100	1294820	I want to kneel down at the gun, look it over without touching it.
1294820	1295820	Pretty normal.
1295820	1301820	It's got, like, a stock, and it's got a barrel, but on the barrel it's almost like a revolver,
1301820	1305060	but instead of the ... What would that be called?
1305060	1309620	It's got a very specific name, and I can't remember.
1309620	1312600	The spinny part ... God, yeah.
1312600	1316900	If you haven't been able to tell by listening to this podcast, I know lots about guns.
1316900	1319620	And I know even more.
1319620	1321500	So instead of that-
1321500	1322500	Oh, God.
1322500	1323500	Chamber?
1323500	1324500	They're chambers.
1324500	1325500	Yeah.
1325500	1330620	So instead of the six chambers, there is one chamber that can be accessed from one side.
1330620	1333700	It's closed on the other side, and then it's got one chamber.
1333700	1336500	She slammed a large bullet into ... You saw her do that.
1336500	1341140	And then it's got those weird metal tubes all around it, and on the back of it, kind
1341140	1347500	of where the hammer would be, there are two lights, one green, one red, and the red one
1347500	1348500	is currently lit.
1348500	1349500	I pick it up.
1349500	1353340	I'm going to look out the window and see what I see out the window.
1353340	1355580	All right, let's get the other boys back in here.
1355580	1356580	Yep.
1356580	1357580	Oh!
1357580	1358580	Oh!
1358580	1359580	Oh!
1359580	1360580	Oh!
1360580	1361580	Thomas already did that.
1361580	1362580	Oh, goodness.
1362580	1363580	Oh.
1363580	1364580	You okay?
1364580	1368720	How much sanity did you lose?
1368720	1370260	Is Tildy alive?
1370260	1373340	Did she explode into black goo?
1373340	1378180	Jon, as you ran around the outside of the house, you get to a point to where you could
1378180	1383800	see the window from where you're assuming her room was, because it's a rather small
1383800	1389640	two-story house, and you see a extremely bright flash of light come from that room.
1389640	1393680	I feel like a really dark tingle of recognition and dread.
1393680	1398440	Keith, you also see a bright flash of light coming from the staircase.
1398440	1400200	Do I hear anything?
1400200	1402020	You hear a thud.
1402020	1404520	I get up out of my wheelchair and start going upstairs.
1404520	1405520	It's a miracle.
1405520	1409200	I can still walk.
1409200	1414440	As Keith is hopping up the stairs, Jon, you see Clark standing in the window.
1414440	1415660	What does he look like?
1415660	1416660	He looks horrified.
1416660	1418200	He's pale white and panicked.
1418200	1420600	I single to him from below to open up the window.
1420600	1421860	I go ahead and do that.
1421860	1424860	What the hell happened?
1424860	1429680	Uh, you didn't see her.
1429680	1430680	See who?
1430680	1431680	Where's Tildy?
1431680	1432680	She's not here.
1432680	1436920	Why don't you come on up here?
1436920	1437920	I come up.
1438240	1441040	The three of you meet at the platform at the top of the stairs.
1441040	1443460	What happened?
1443460	1449920	So I busted in the door, and she shot me.
1449920	1456200	She pointed a gun at me, and she chambered a bullet, and she shot me, and there was this
1456200	1460960	blinding white light, and then she wasn't there anymore.
1460960	1462160	Are you shot?
1462160	1464520	I don't think so.
1464520	1465520	What's the gun look like?
1465520	1466520	Be cautious, Leag.
1466520	1467520	Go look at the gun.
1468120	1474480	The gun looks like an old-timey revolver, but where the chamber is, six bullets, maybe
1474480	1475480	you know.
1475480	1476480	Do you know what that thing's called?
1476480	1477480	Cylinder.
1477480	1478480	Cylinder!
1478480	1479480	That's the name!
1479480	1480480	We could not come up with it.
1480480	1485160	So where the cylinder was, there's basically, on one side, it's completely enclosed, cased
1485160	1490040	in, and on the other side, there's a small sliding door, basically, that you can slide
1490040	1495680	open and shut, and it would fit one bullet that's the size of a cylinder.
1495680	1502060	And then there are glass tubes, one going underneath it, and then one kind of going
1502060	1507660	around the side where it's closed, and then on the back of the gun where the hammer is,
1507660	1511560	there are two lights, one red, one green, and the red one is lit.
1511560	1514000	John, it's like that goddamn camera you found.
1514000	1515000	How do you mean?
1515000	1517120	It's got glass tubing and lights.
1517120	1518400	I don't really see it.
1518400	1519400	I shake him.
1519400	1521400	Don't fuck with me, man!
1521400	1522400	Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry.
1522400	1523720	You're, it's, of course.
1523720	1525360	I want to look around the rest of the room.
1525360	1526360	She's not in the closet.
1526360	1527360	I checked there.
1527360	1528360	I mean, you saw her run in the room.
1528360	1529840	Well, I want to see if anything else like that is in here.
1529840	1531600	You sure she was in here when you opened that door?
1531600	1533360	She was frightened as all get out.
1533360	1534360	She was scared.
1534360	1535360	We looked each other in the eye.
1535360	1537160	What did the bullet look like that she chambered?
1537160	1538720	I was going to ask that as Joe.
1538720	1542780	Did I see her chamber the bullet itself, and did I see what light, if there were lights
1542780	1544720	on the gun at the time that she shot?
1544720	1547900	The lights would have been facing her, so you wouldn't have seen that.
1547900	1553160	You did see her slam a, what looked like a large bullet casing.
1553160	1554160	Did he see the tubes?
1554160	1555160	Oh yeah, they were there.
1555160	1556340	Let's see where she got the bullet from.
1556340	1558840	She already had it in hand when he kicked in the door.
1558840	1560400	Okay, we heard her fumbling around.
1560400	1563840	As soon as he kicked in the door, she slammed that bullet into place and shot.
1563840	1564840	Okay.
1564840	1565840	It was a big ass bullet.
1565840	1566840	Where'd it go?
1566840	1567840	Where'd she go?
1567840	1571200	Well, let's, let's look around the room and see if we find anything else similar to the
1571200	1572200	camera or the gun.
1572200	1573200	Clark points under the bed.
1573200	1575480	I checked there and he points at the closet.
1575480	1576480	I checked, I checked there.
1576480	1579800	I don't know where else, unless you jumped out the window, but you were out there.
1579800	1581120	Did you check under the bed?
1581120	1582120	That's, yeah, that's what I meant.
1582120	1583120	I checked under the bed.
1583120	1584120	Did you check in the bed?
1584120	1585120	Nope.
1585120	1588240	I checked in the bed.
1588240	1595380	Pulling back the covers.
1595380	1599100	There's an elaborate like fake sleeping doll that she had made to sneak out of the house
1599100	1600100	later than me.
1600100	1604760	Ferris Bueller asks, three pillows outside of contention Missouri.
1604760	1605760	Boo.
1605760	1607760	Yeah, that was bad.
1607760	1612800	I want to start looking around in some drawers and stuff.
1612800	1613800	Oh yeah.
1613800	1614800	Yeah.
1615480	1616480	Let's toss this place.
1616480	1617800	I think Clark is sitting on the edge of the bed.
1617800	1620660	I think we're all okay with that.
1620660	1626960	It's really just a completely normal teenager's room, but inside her sock drawer is a wad
1626960	1628840	of $20 bills all rolled up.
1628840	1629840	I take it.
1629840	1634400	A drug dealer's wad, like more of a wad than a teenager should have or like the kind of
1634400	1637320	scrap you might get like selling bullshit at a flea park.
1637320	1638320	Yeah, exactly.
1638320	1639320	Like 200 bucks.
1639320	1642040	So like the meanest definition of wad.
1642040	1643040	Oh yeah.
1643040	1644040	Yeah.
1644280	1649360	Also, oh my God, like if I was fucking 15 right now and had a wad of 200 bucks, I would
1649360	1650360	feel like a clean.
1650360	1651360	A what?
1651360	1658080	Also, just like right now at 28, I would really love to have $200 in my pocket.
1658080	1661360	When the gun went off and there was the flash of light, was there a sound?
1661360	1662360	No.
1662360	1663360	Okay.
1663360	1665120	I want to hop back downstairs and let Mildred know.
1665120	1668160	We all came here together, but did we take separate cars?
1668160	1669680	I want to know where the camera is basically.
1669680	1673200	I want to take a picture of this room with the camera and I want to see if her shooting
1673200	1674400	anything is like reactive.
1674400	1676240	I want to see if it's the green lights on again.
1676240	1677240	Okay.
1677240	1679040	So if I have to go back to the station or whatever and get it.
1679040	1681080	It can be in your cruiser outside.
1681080	1684440	You probably took two cruisers here because Keith is probably not driving.
1684440	1685440	Nope.
1685440	1686440	So has anything changed with the camera?
1686440	1687440	Is the green light back on?
1687440	1688440	No, it's red.
1688440	1689600	I want to take it into the room.
1689600	1692440	So you rush out the front door.
1692440	1698880	Keith and Clark, you guys come back downstairs and Mildred is sitting on her couch in a Snuggie
1698880	1702300	drinking some tea, watching TV.
1702300	1705540	As I run by, I'm like, Hey Mildred, has Tildy ever disappeared in a flash of light before?
1705540	1706540	I'll be right back.
1706540	1707540	But think on that.
1707540	1710940	She kind of looks up at the two of you as you come down the stairs.
1710940	1715540	As John comes running back inside, she's like super blazed in her eyes.
1715540	1719020	Hey Tildy, honestly, for somebody who smokes weed all the time, it seems like you cannot
1719020	1720740	handle your shit.
1720740	1722260	Just in as I'm running back to Tildy's room.
1722260	1724460	Anyway, you smoke some weak ass grass.
1724460	1725700	Hey Mildred.
1725700	1726700	Hey.
1726700	1729340	You got any of that peppermint tea still?
1729340	1730340	It's sitting right here for you.
1730380	1734380	I go over and I'm just sitting at the kitchen table or whatever it is, head in hand, drinking
1734380	1735380	it.
1735380	1736380	Did you know that she had a gun?
1736380	1737380	She?
1737380	1738380	She had a what?
1738380	1742500	She had a gun and also she's not here anymore.
1742500	1744180	What do you mean she's not here anymore?
1744180	1748940	We don't know where she is, but she ain't here.
1748940	1750380	Wasn't she upstairs?
1750380	1752380	He knows more about it than we do.
1752380	1758340	Tildy B. Tildy B.
1758340	1759620	I'm upstairs in her room.
1759620	1762060	I'm just like, no, she disappeared in light.
1762060	1763060	We told you.
1788340	1789340	Never know.
1789340	1790340	Drowning out.
1790340	1791340	All I know.
1791340	1792340	There's nobody home.
1792340	1793340	Nobody home.
1793340	1794340	There's nobody home.
1794340	1795340	Fight, fight.
1795340	1796340	Street me down.
1796340	1797340	Takes me back.
1797340	1798340	To where you're from.
1798340	1799340	Don't stop.
1799340	1800340	Don't stop.
1800340	1801340	Don't stop.
1801340	1802340	Don't stop.
1802340	1803340	Don't stop.
1803340	1803340	
1818340	1846340	Don't stop.
1846340	1875340	Don't give up.
1876340	1891340	Don't give up.
1891340	1920340	Don't give up.
1921340	1930340	Don't give up.
