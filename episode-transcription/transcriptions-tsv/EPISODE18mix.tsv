0	6880	Hello all my nephews and nieces, it is your fun uncle, Wolf the Dog, and I'm here to
6880	14120	weird y'all out from 694.2 PTBP Contention's Greatest Radio Show.
14120	20800	This episode is brought to you by Fire Lizard Games, a tabletop games company based in Springfield
20800	23480	run by just three brothers.
23480	31200	They currently have a Kickstarter launched in their first game, Base, a card PG.
31200	38680	Base is a setting agnostic storytelling game using a simple, uniquely designed system.
38680	44120	They designed the game to be appealing for everyone, whether you are a newcomer to roleplaying
44120	47520	games or a stone cold pro.
47520	52680	All you need to play the game is the rulebook, a standard deck of cards, and a few six-sided
52680	53680	dice.
53680	59560	The Kickstarter tiers start as low as $3 and it will end on April 16th, my babies.
59560	65840	Give them a follow on Facebook for your buddy Wolf, or Instagram, or Twitter, or how about
65840	70200	all three, at Fire Lizard Games for more updates.
70200	76040	And now let's get back to my favorite segment, Howlin' with Wolf, where we get to hear from
76040	80720	our caring, adoring, and intelligent listeners.
80760	86280	This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Hot Donna on Twitter, who writes,
86280	90880	After careful consideration, my request is as follows.
90880	96200	Instead of making an actual announcement, I would love for Wolf to make one incredibly
96200	99880	long and possibly melodic fart noise.
99880	105040	Ahem, I guess it might go something like,
115320	122160	Well, Hot Donna, I hope that made you happy inside, cuz, uh, yeah.
122160	127760	Anyway, it's time to remember what happened last time, it's the news.
127760	133640	Turns out, maybe Keith is a monster to be around because his dad was a dick who clearly
133640	137000	preferred his older son, Ferguson.
137000	142280	Now that's not an excuse, Officer Vigna is the worst person in contention.
142280	147560	While playing on the family's sprawling estate, Keith and Ferguson heard the sirens blaring
147560	152880	as strange, gaunt men in suits appeared to fall from the sky and were shot down by the
152880	155360	Bean's security personnel.
155360	160520	Later that night, William Beans gave Ferguson a watch and told him about a prophecy that
160520	162800	says he will save the world.
162800	168400	Back in whatever year it is now, the officers took the pastor's helmet to the police station
168400	173360	and locked it up with the other items from the booth at Forgotten Treasures.
173360	179000	The light on the camera was green, so John took a picture of Keith outside the station.
179000	184480	Unsurprisingly, the picture was not of Keith, but of two men in a strange room that lacked
184480	185720	color.
185720	190560	On the way to the mill, on the other side of the city, John saw something strange in
190560	197480	the sky, causing a fiery three car wreck on the main longitudinal drag of contention.
197480	203040	Taking us to that scene now, is Kudzu with no backbone.
227480	236840	I need everyone to roll power.
236840	240720	I fail.
240720	244840	I'm the most powerful motherfucker.
244840	248600	I fail, 96 on a 60.
248600	251440	I got an 86 on a 50.
251440	252440	Okay.
252440	256000	You have all been in a car wreck.
256000	262880	You have the choice to either stay put in the exact position that you're in or to move.
262880	268460	Now real quick, I'm going to have you all roll a D6 for hit points to see how many you
268460	270320	lost from the wreck.
270320	271320	Four.
271320	272320	One.
272320	273320	Two.
273320	277240	That puts me at 24.
277240	280240	I'm at 14.
280240	281880	Luke said he was at 19.
281880	283080	I'm at 19.
283080	284080	My name is Keith.
284080	285080	Oh yeah.
285080	286080	Oh no.
286080	287080	Oh no.
287080	288080	Keith.
288080	289080	Oh no.
289080	290080	Luke, it's you.
290080	291080	I'm at 19.
291080	296320	Guys, I was in a car wreck tonight, I don't know if I can finish the episode.
296320	303560	You all hear this vehicle that is flown off the side of the road on fire.
303560	305880	Do you move or do you stay put?
305880	306880	I move.
306880	307880	I move.
307880	309880	Is my car still operational?
309880	310880	Is it on?
310880	311880	No.
311880	312880	I move.
312880	313880	Okay.
313880	315680	I got their power check.
315680	316680	Just John.
316680	321960	John, you lose one willpower and I need the other two to roll a D4 for me.
321960	322960	One.
322960	323960	Three.
323960	326040	That was willpower?
326040	327040	It was indeed.
327040	331320	Well, Clark Bishop is at seven willpower, John Lee Pettymore is at 11 willpower.
331320	332320	I'm at one.
332320	335560	However, yes, Keith Vigna is at one willpower.
335560	337880	I thought you did all the coke to gain willpower.
337880	342560	I did the coke to not have a minus 20 to my rolls.
342560	349280	When you get down to one or two willpower, you're at a negative 20% on all rolls.
349280	354840	Now, Keith Vigna, having lost willpower at this point, you were back at a negative 20%
354840	356600	on all rolls.
356600	360600	And so your high of your cane-
360600	362220	It was so harsh, dude.
362220	364360	It was harsh as fuck.
364360	365680	You no longer have the-
365680	366680	I do more.
366680	367680	Advantages.
367920	372960	So you guys are all in the car wreck and John passed his power roll and so he's spending
372960	374720	one willpower to move.
374720	380480	Keith and Clark both failed their power rolls and so they had to roll a D4 in order to find
380480	383560	out how much willpower they were going to lose in order to move.
383560	386140	Keith is losing one willpower point to move.
386140	389740	Clark failed and is spending three willpower points to move.
389740	396400	Clark is driving one cruiser with Keith sitting shotgun and John is driving the cruiser ahead
396440	399240	that got rear ended by Clark's cruiser.
399240	403960	Now, John, I need you to roll luck for me.
403960	405600	John's luck is 55.
405600	406600	Yes.
406600	407600	98.
407600	409160	And he fails.
409160	416760	So I need you to roll a dexterity check to try to get out of your seat, which your seat
416760	420880	belt is completely jammed and you're stuck in your seat currently.
420880	421960	11.
421960	423040	Critical success.
423040	427320	You want to describe how you get out of this car in a very cool way?
427320	428320	Yeah.
428320	430300	We describe how I'm stuck again real quick.
430300	436520	You got crunched from the back and so your seat literally moved forward and your knees
436520	442400	went into the console of your cruiser, breaking through the plastic on either side of the
442400	447280	steering wheel and so your knees are like cut up and bleeding from the plastic and you
447280	452760	hit your head on the steering wheel and so you're kind of dazed and your seat has moved
452760	456120	forward in a way to where your seat belt has jammed you into position.
456120	458240	Oh, I don't know how I'm going to get out of that.
458240	459400	That sounds really bad.
459400	463920	You can do anything to get out of this because you rolled a critical success.
463920	466200	He chews his way out.
466200	467600	Like a rat in a...
467600	473280	Yeah, I think he just takes his flashlight and just bangs it against the seat belt a
473280	475360	few times and gets lucky.
475360	481520	Yeah, wiggles out the window basically while doing a somersault because it's a crit success.
481560	486400	Oh, can I trade in for doing something really cool for my crit success with noticing a little
486400	490700	bit more about the situation as I get out because what I'm really interested in is what's
490700	495160	happened to what was hit, who was hit, and what's all going on.
495160	496160	Absolutely.
496160	503460	So as you make it out of your police cruiser, you would notice not only has your police
503460	509900	cruiser caught fire, but you look over and you actually see the other vehicle that you
509900	513140	ran off the road by swerving into their lane.
513140	514540	It's a minivan.
514540	520300	It is flipped over and it is currently leaking fluid all over the ground.
520300	523300	Keith, I need you to roll luck.
523300	527100	A 70 and a 65.
527100	529060	You are pinched.
529060	534540	Your cruiser with Clark driving smashed into the back of John's cruiser.
534540	536100	Your airbag went off.
536100	538380	It knocked you back and...
538380	541220	My penis fell off.
541220	542220	I used my penis to unlock...
542220	543220	Grab it.
543220	544220	Grab it with the door.
544220	545220	I grab his penis.
545220	546220	Thanks, Clark.
546220	553580	Your side of the car got completely smashed in and so your door is unable to open.
553580	558300	So you're going to have to smash through the window to get out of this vehicle.
558300	560340	So I need you to roll strength for me.
560340	562780	10 on a 55.
562780	563780	All right.
563780	564780	So...
564780	565780	I...
565780	567660	Give me a second to think about it.
567660	573700	Oh, I take my handy dandy handgun and use the butt of it to just...
573700	576900	And I am very careful not to cut myself.
576900	579340	Fire some warning shots outside for you.
579340	586620	No, I like to conserve my ammunition for people that threaten me or people I want to threaten.
586620	587940	So yeah, I do that.
587940	589980	And then do I have a move or...
589980	597220	So you can use your turn to get out of the vehicle and as you do get out of the vehicle,
597220	602620	you would notice that this cruiser that you were in, Clark's cruiser, is also leaking
602620	605540	fluid all over the ground underneath the vehicle.
605540	608020	Clark, I need you to roll luck for me.
608020	610460	53 on a 75.
610460	611460	Okay.
611460	616460	I mean, you already spent your three willpower to make a move action this round.
616460	622220	So you can use that to get out of the car or do anything else that you want to do.
622220	623780	No, I just want to get out of the car.
623780	624780	Okay, awesome.
624820	628860	You get out of the car, you would notice as well that there is liquid underneath your
628860	633180	car and you would also see John's cruiser is catching fire.
633180	640460	You all look over and see this minivan that has swerved off the road is completely upside
640460	645780	down and dark liquid coming out all over the place.
645780	646780	Round two.
646780	649140	I need everyone to roll power in order to move.
649140	650140	Fuck.
650140	652620	No, 68 on a 60.
652620	655100	I pass with a 45 on a 60.
655100	656100	Crit failed.
656100	657820	Your other penis falls off.
657820	660180	Clark, we'll start with you this time.
660180	661180	You succeeded.
661180	662180	Mm-hmm.
662180	664260	So you're only going to lose one willpower right now?
664260	667340	Am I going to lose willpower because I have one willpower?
667340	669700	Does that mean I die?
669700	672980	Going to zero willpower doesn't mean that you die, but I will describe what happens
672980	675980	to you in just a second.
675980	681260	What's my distance from the front of John's car and what's my distance from the van?
681260	684420	You are one move action away from either.
684420	686220	Shit.
686220	690180	But is one closer?
690180	691180	They are equidistant.
691180	692180	Okay.
692180	693180	I'm going to go to the van.
693180	694180	Okay.
694180	695180	Sounds good.
695180	697020	You run up to the van.
697020	700300	Roll an alertness check for me.
700300	701300	Fuck.
701300	704300	A 90 on a 70.
704300	705300	Okay.
705300	708780	So you see two people in the front seats.
708780	714100	There's a woman driving and a young boy in the front seat.
714100	715100	Okay.
715100	717180	John, you failed your power check.
717180	718180	Yeah.
718180	720020	So I need you to roll a D4 for me.
720020	721020	What?
721020	722020	Okay.
722020	724860	So you lose one willpower in order to move this round.
724860	725860	I'm down to 10.
725860	726860	Yeah.
726860	728600	Just for the record, I'm down to six.
728600	733900	I would like to grab the fire extinguisher from my cruiser and attempt to put out the
733900	735740	fire on my engine.
735740	737900	Does it look extinguishable at this juncture?
738020	739020	Yes, absolutely.
739020	741740	So go ahead and roll law for me.
741740	744140	I got a 50-50 shot.
744140	745140	13.
745140	746780	Describe what you do.
746780	752300	Calmly and efficiently, like seeing Clark taking care of the civilians, I demonstrate
752300	755940	an excellent knowledge of law and procedure.
755940	757400	Go right to the compartment.
757400	763720	My extinguisher is locked in and calmly, but professionally and with the quickness, I put
763720	764720	the fire out.
764720	765720	Wonderful.
765720	770640	After you do that, you see Clark's cruiser begins to go up in flames.
770640	774320	The engine is smoking and you see flames licking out from underneath the hood.
774320	777400	I'm just going to Benny Hill style run between both cars.
777400	780200	So you've taken care of your cruiser.
780200	784840	Keith Vigna, you failed your power check in order to move.
784840	790120	I need you to roll a D4 for me, although it doesn't really matter.
790120	791120	One.
791120	792640	That means I'm at zero.
792640	794840	Keith has hit zero willpower.
794960	802240	Keith hops out of the side door of Clark's police cruiser and desperately looks around,
802240	808520	smelling the gas, seeing the oil, seeing the flames, seeing this minivan.
808520	812160	Your head begins spinning and you black out.
812160	818980	The two of you look over and see Officer Vigna, just eyes go blank and he falls backward onto
818980	824000	the ground right next to Clark's cruiser.
824000	825000	And three.
825000	826000	Fight!
826000	830720	I need John and Clark to roll power for me.
830720	833040	Oh, God damn it.
833040	835040	Sixty two on a sixty.
835040	836040	Thirty two on a sixty.
836040	837040	Okay.
837040	841480	Clark, you're going to lose one willpower and John, go ahead and roll a D4 for me.
841480	842480	Four.
842480	844720	John loses four willpower and Clark loses one.
844720	845720	I'm now at five.
845720	846720	I'm at six.
846720	847720	All right.
847720	851440	Clark, I need you to roll a luck check for me real quick.
851440	853080	Ah, fuck.
853080	855720	Uh, ninety on a seventy five.
855720	856720	Awesome.
856720	857720	Fuck you.
857720	863760	That will come into play in just a second.
863760	865600	So John, what do you want to do this round?
865600	870240	I get, yeah, I want to try to extinguish the fire in on the other cruiser.
870240	873720	Is there enough juice left in the container or do I need to get theirs?
873720	876640	Why would you ask that?
876640	888640	I'll go ahead and let you, uh, by the way, this is a super important role and I'm going
888640	895360	to let you finish out the rest of this canister on their car, but I need you to roll law in
895360	897720	order to put it out.
897720	899360	Okay.
899360	902000	Forty.
902000	903520	Fuck you.
903520	904520	Well done.
904520	905520	Thank you.
905520	906520	Nice.
907400	912120	Once again, like fucking calmly as shit, John Lee Pettymore, who has lost a lot of willpower
912120	915680	and HP, like bleeding all over the extinguisher.
915680	921000	I just nailed that shit and save this family, the passed out Clark's, like all the converging
921000	923480	fluids you've been sending at us.
923480	925840	So you have had all the fluid that didn't combust.
925840	933840	So you have successfully, you have successfully stopped the combustion of the fluids of your
933840	937040	police cruiser as well as Clark's police cruiser.
937040	944760	Clark, you, you are crouched down at this minivan and the flames are growing taller
944760	954080	and taller coming out of the bottom of the front of this minivan and the smell is overwhelming.
954080	955640	What would you like to do with your turn?
955640	958040	Are either of the occupants conscious?
958040	960840	Roll first aid.
961840	965560	Oh, crit fail 77 on a 30.
965560	966560	They died on impact.
966560	974600	As far as you can tell, these aren't people at all, they're bears.
974600	979400	You would have absolutely no idea, but they might be beyond saving at this point.
979400	981920	They look pretty dead.
981920	984840	Save them anyway.
984840	988920	I assume I'm on the, actually I don't assume, what, what side am I on when I, when I walked
988920	989920	up to it?
990000	991000	What side do you want to be on?
991000	993160	I guess I would prefer to be on the passenger side.
993160	994320	You are on the passenger side.
994320	995320	I break it.
995320	996320	I break in the window.
996320	997520	Go ahead and roll.
997520	1000720	You can roll strength or law.
1000720	1002720	I'm rolling strength.
1002720	1006080	Uh, four on a 65.
1006080	1007080	Okay.
1007080	1013440	Good old smash it, uh, smash in the window and it's a kid you mentioned.
1013440	1014440	Yes.
1014440	1015440	It's a young boy.
1015440	1019520	I try to get up under kind of underneath him and hit his seatbelt and kind of catch him
1019520	1022320	as he falls and then pull, drag him out.
1022320	1027160	And as far away from the cars, I feel as a safe distance, but not too far away because
1027160	1029520	I'd like to try and go back for the driver.
1029520	1030520	Absolutely.
1030520	1038360	And as you pull him away from the car, the minivan explodes and I wouldn't say mushroom
1038360	1046160	cloud, but there is one of those wily coyote, like small ones, tiny wily coyote mushroom
1046160	1050120	cloud erupts from this minivan.
1050120	1052520	And the entire thing, I mean, this is loud.
1052520	1062900	The entire thing is up in flames and you guys just hear all this and you also hear the screaming
1062900	1064640	of a young girl.
1064640	1074640	I need the two of you who are still conscious to roll sanity, uh, 16, uh, 56 on a 37 fail.
1074640	1075640	Okay.
1076120	1086200	You are hearing the sounds of rubber popping and plastic melting and your stimuli are completely
1086200	1090160	overwhelmed and you don't, it just sounds like ringing in the ears to me.
1090160	1091160	Exactly.
1091160	1101680	And Clark, you absolutely know that there's someone screaming for help inside this burning
1101680	1102680	vehicle.
1102680	1105240	I need you to lose one sanity.
1105240	1109080	That puts me at 36 with a breaking point of 31.
1109080	1113680	Oh, you've got to drink when you're a sanity hits your age.
1113680	1114680	Is that how old you are?
1114680	1115680	I missed it.
1115680	1116680	No.
1116680	1119680	Oh, you got to drink twice.
1119680	1120680	Okay.
1120680	1124840	I keep forgetting you're younger than I am in the game.
1124840	1132280	You old motherfuckers is like eight months older than you or something.
1132280	1134120	I know it's like a year and a half, right?
1134120	1135400	You're 26, right?
1135400	1136400	Yeah.
1136400	1137400	Luke is 17.
1137400	1141680	I'm almost 17.
1141680	1143080	New character voice.
1143080	1145800	I'm almost 17.
1145800	1149920	That's what Keith speaks like after the explosion.
1149920	1156600	I hit my head really hard when I passed out.
1156600	1162300	This is how Keith finds his character voice.
1162300	1163300	It's perfect.
1163300	1166660	Just a shitty Russell Brand.
1166660	1175900	I talk like, oh, from London, you talk like you're from London, from London, London, London.
1175900	1180820	I'm almost 17, I'm almost 17.
1180820	1182380	Sounds awful.
1182380	1185300	John, what do you do?
1185300	1187180	Can I do an awareness roll?
1187180	1189920	Well, I don't know how realistic that is.
1189920	1191860	Have I noticed Vigna lying there?
1191860	1192860	Yeah.
1192860	1194900	I just go over to him and try to resuscitate.
1194900	1195900	Okay.
1195900	1196900	Sounds good.
1196900	1199100	Go ahead and roll first aid for me.
1199100	1200100	Oh, wow.
1200100	1201100	This could go, yeah.
1201100	1202420	I don't have that.
1202420	1203740	What is your first aid?
1203740	1205140	The basic 10%.
1205140	1206140	Cool.
1206140	1207140	Good luck.
1207140	1210460	Which is exactly how confident I think I would feel as a real person in an emergency
1210460	1211460	situation.
1211460	1215740	There's like, okay, if I can wrap my shirt around it, then I've seen that in a movie.
1215740	1216740	Otherwise 33, crit fail.
1216740	1217740	Yeah.
1217740	1218740	I thought it was crit success.
1218740	1224140	You try to CPR me and you give me a heart attack.
1224140	1225140	Break your collarbone.
1225140	1228500	Also, what is the extent of, I'm not like cut up or anything.
1228500	1229500	I'm just-
1229500	1230500	No, you're just like unconscious, right?
1230500	1231820	Just passed out and probably hit my head.
1231820	1233820	You're probably bleeding from your face a little bit.
1233820	1236860	I'm trying to slap your face and maybe I like accidentally-
1236860	1237860	A little too hard.
1237860	1238860	Yeah.
1238860	1239860	Poke you really hard in the eye.
1239860	1240860	Yeah.
1240860	1242860	He lost the eye on the rack.
1242860	1243860	It was weird.
1243860	1250980	Jon, you run over to Keith to try to resuscitate him and as you're running over, you actually
1250980	1259460	trip and fall and your knee comes down right on Keith Vigna's nose.
1259460	1263440	Does it fall off like his penis?
1263440	1270540	You hear a crunch as your knee goes down onto his face, but you immediately catch yourself
1270540	1277620	and get up, but he is bleeding just way more profusely than he was before.
1277620	1280020	And Keith, I need you to roll, actually, you know what?
1280020	1281020	You did the damage.
1281020	1282620	Jon, go ahead and roll a-
1282620	1283620	Oh, no.
1283620	1284620	D4.
1284620	1285620	I'll really try not to.
1285620	1286620	One.
1286620	1287620	Ah.
1287620	1290620	Keith, you take one hit point of damage.
1290620	1296380	I only broke in as a little, just a little.
1296380	1298460	I am down to 18 hit points.
1298460	1299460	Clucks.
1299460	1300460	Your turn, what do you do?
1300460	1301780	I've got the kid over by the side.
1301780	1303980	Can I discern better if he's conscious or not?
1303980	1305400	Is he lucid at least?
1305400	1306980	Is he lucid or not lucid, I guess?
1306980	1308820	He is still very unconscious.
1308820	1309820	Okay.
1309820	1311780	Check for a pulse.
1311780	1313580	How engulfed is the van?
1313580	1314580	Holy.
1314580	1319540	I want to, yeah, I want to run over to the driver's side and just see if I can get close
1319540	1323140	enough to kick the window in.
1323140	1324140	Crit failure.
1324140	1327260	Kick her in the face while she's talking.
1327260	1330060	Okay, cool.
1330060	1333380	So I don't know, I don't know how to, you know, what do you guys-
1333380	1336820	Have you seen the movie Crash?
1336820	1339460	If it's, if it's, it won an Oscar, so.
1339460	1341080	So yeah, it's possible.
1341080	1343700	This episode will probably win the podcast if it won one of the Oscars.
1343700	1345700	I've seen all the best movies.
1345700	1349580	The worst episode of our podcast will win a, what does a podcast win?
1349580	1350580	A potty.
1350580	1351580	No, they have a name.
1351580	1352580	Anywho.
1352580	1353580	Blowy.
1353580	1354580	A blowy.
1354580	1357140	If you're saying it's so hot that no human could get close enough to do this, then just
1357140	1359700	say that I won't, I won't roll for it or anything.
1359700	1362420	You are more than welcome to do anything that you want.
1362420	1366060	But I just mean, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not physically there.
1366060	1370820	So if you picture it being so hot that it would deter me, I need to know that.
1370820	1373980	It will cause you damage if you go in there.
1373980	1374980	Okay.
1374980	1375980	I'm not going to do it.
1375980	1376980	I'm going to run back to the boy.
1376980	1377980	Okay.
1377980	1381300	And as a, as I'm running back to the boy, I'm going to go ahead and radio in to Drew
1381300	1383020	unless I have a direct line to paramedics.
1383020	1385300	Oh, you absolutely do.
1385300	1386940	We need emergency services up here.
1386940	1388140	We've got some hurt people.
1388140	1390260	We're just up the road from the clinic.
1390260	1391260	Send ambulances.
1391260	1392260	The clinic.
1392260	1393900	And then I want to try and first aid the kid.
1393900	1394900	Okay.
1394900	1396900	Go ahead and roll first aid for me.
1396900	1397900	Fuck.
1397900	1401540	A 72 on a 30.
1401540	1406500	He is still very unconscious and his breathing begins to slow.
1406500	1410740	I'm going to have you go ahead and roll luck for me.
1410740	1411740	Fail.
1411740	1414020	93 on a 75.
1414020	1416100	You chip over him and break his nose.
1416100	1417100	Also.
1417100	1418100	Yeah.
1418100	1421260	That's all of my fails from here on out.
1421260	1426940	You tripping fall on someone and it hurts him real bad fucking idiot fail on hacking
1426940	1429100	that computer.
1429100	1433620	You trip over it and break your nose.
1433620	1437340	A broken nose is my favorite thing to do in a role playing game.
1437340	1440620	Just in case you can get people to talk like this.
1440620	1442260	Is that how you're going to give him this character?
1442260	1449140	I was hoping that Luke might have the new broken nose character voice.
1449140	1453180	It's funny because when we started, he thought about holding his gun to do this the whole
1453180	1457460	time and I'm so glad I did not do that.
1457460	1458460	Okay.
1458460	1462860	So after that very funny exchange, you see this boy begin to die.
1462860	1468140	As the ambulances arrive on the scene, two paramedics hop out immediately.
1468140	1471340	One of them comes over, comes up to you, Clark, cause you have the boy.
1471740	1473660	Hey man, what happened here?
1473660	1475660	I don't, I don't, I don't know.
1475660	1480140	It's all I'm a, it was an accident.
1480140	1482620	They went off the road.
1482620	1484020	I don't, I don't think he's doing so good.
1484020	1485020	Okay.
1485020	1489380	So they are loading him up on the stretcher as you're, as you're telling them this and
1489380	1491000	they get the boy into the ambulance.
1491000	1497220	The fire truck arrives and firemen hop out and begin putting out the flames on this minivan.
1497220	1498220	What are you guys doing?
1498260	1504700	Well, I want to send one of a paramedic after Keith and then I want to go investigate the
1504700	1506580	body on the hood of my car.
1506580	1509780	I want to talk to a fireman or more like yell.
1509780	1511900	There was, there was somebody in the driver's seat.
1511900	1512900	They were screaming there.
1512900	1517620	I don't think they're, I think they're, I think they're dead, but if we can get in there.
1517620	1519100	Calm down officer.
1519100	1520100	We're on it.
1520100	1521100	Oh God.
1521100	1523340	You guys remember 9-11 fucking firemen?
1523340	1528140	Sorry if my voice is really weird, but I'm really hoarse from a three day bachelor party.
1528180	1531180	I'm really horny from a three day bachelor party.
1531180	1534060	I'm a horse from a three day bachelor party.
1534060	1535060	Ooh.
1535060	1536060	Naaay.
1536060	1537060	Edited that out.
1537060	1538060	Um.
1538060	1540100	Do not edit what he's saying.
1540100	1543660	I'm a horse from a three day bachelor party out.
1543660	1544940	That's so good.
1544940	1549060	So as soon as they get the young boy up into the ambulance, they pull another stretcher
1549060	1552660	out, get Keith on it, get him into an ambulance.
1552660	1553660	Amber lamps.
1553660	1558580	One, you would see them take Keith away on a stretcher as you walk over to the front
1558580	1566700	of your police cruiser, which is completely covered in fire foam or fire foam, the detritus
1566700	1568020	of a fire machine.
1568020	1569020	Oh God.
1569020	1570020	I can't.
1570020	1572020	Oh, that was so adorable.
1572020	1576260	I was trying to do a fireball, but my voice can't get up there.
1576260	1577260	Anyway.
1577260	1582580	Do it again.
1582580	1583580	Fire foam.
1584500	1592820	So as you go up, you see this body that fell from the sky like an angel on his back into
1592820	1593820	the cruiser.
1593820	1602100	And when you walk around, you see him and you kind of move some of the foam away from
1602100	1604140	his face.
1604140	1611380	And he is a short balding man with large eyes and a tiny nose.
1611380	1616300	And he has fool seared into his forehead with a brand.
1616300	1618860	I shout over to, uh, to Clark.
1618860	1621660	Hey Clark, I think we found John Peters.
1634140	1649660	Keith, you were looking at all of this chaos around you and your mind just couldn't handle
1649660	1655260	it and your body just shuts down and everything goes black.
1655260	1661940	You wake up in bed, it's Christmas morning and you hear the faint sounds of laughter
1661940	1663660	coming from downstairs.
1663660	1669540	I rub my eyes and I get out of bed and I, I look around and I realize I went to bed
1669540	1675180	early last night so that Santa Claus could come bring me some gifts.
1675180	1677560	So I immediately realized that it's Christmas day.
1677560	1685300	So I excitedly run down the stairs and I see my entire family, my mom, my dad, my brother
1685300	1688100	Ferguson, all sitting around a bunch of gifts.
1688100	1692180	Half of them are already open and they all turn their heads at me.
1692180	1699740	My mom goes, oh, I guess we forgot to wake up Keith and they all laugh.
1699740	1706220	And I, and you actually, you hear your father chortles and says, yes, that's right.
1706220	1707220	We forgot.
1707220	1714500	I pretend like I didn't hear that and I sit down, uh, directly across from my brother
1714500	1715500	Ferguson.
1715500	1717660	I say, Hey, what, what have you gotten already?
1717660	1721960	Ferguson just stares at you with a blank expression.
1721960	1726020	His eyes have looked different ever since your dad gave him that watch.
1726020	1731980	William, your father says, we got Ferguson some games that will help him train for his
1731980	1733060	path.
1733060	1734060	That's cool.
1734060	1736580	Maybe once you beat the games, I can play them.
1736580	1739940	Well, they aren't really for you.
1739940	1742260	Can I, I can watch you play them.
1742260	1743260	Perhaps.
1743260	1744260	Okay.
1744260	1746580	Well, Hey, Hey dad.
1746580	1749260	I get, where's my presence at?
1749260	1755500	Your mom, without breaking her smiling eye contact with your father, points to a box
1755500	1759740	on the other side of the room, like, okay, is it my turn to open it yet?
1759740	1765500	In unison, your parents say, no, as they push another present toward Ferguson.
1765500	1766500	Okay.
1766500	1769580	Uh, Hey Fergie, I'm excited to see what you got.
1769580	1771060	Can I help you open it?
1771060	1777740	Ferguson looks to your parents, both of them, sternly shaking their heads and his eyes begin
1777740	1781220	to tear up as he opens his present.
1781220	1784100	What did you want more than anything else for Christmas this year?
1784100	1790020	I wanted the pro players extended pack of Pokemon cards with all the holograms that
1790020	1796820	had all of the rare cards and super rare and all the shiny ones you see Fergie open up
1796820	1803260	this present and it's all these Pokemon cards that you desperately wanted and kept asking
1803260	1807820	for and dropping hints for the past couple months that this is what you wanted.
1807820	1813680	And Fergie looks up with these begging eyes as your father says, do it.
1813680	1819280	And Ferguson shuts his eyes tight, a single tear running down each cheek as he picks up
1819280	1827120	his Christmas hot cocoa and pours it all into the box filled with these cards of pocket
1827120	1828400	monsters.
1828400	1834440	I start crying immediately and then I don't, I don't even ask.
1834440	1842520	I just rip open my gift expecting to see more Pokemon cards, but I open it up and it's a
1842520	1849660	white box, one that I've recognized from years prior from Christmases past and I knew that
1849660	1853300	it contained just clothes.
1853300	1855260	It's just a clothes box.
1855260	1859600	And when you open it, it is a brand new jacket.
1859600	1863820	Something you're not accustomed to since you are typically the recipient of Ferguson's
1863820	1865020	hand-me-downs.
1865020	1870600	And it is exactly the style of jacket all the young boys are envious of at this time.
1870600	1875480	My immediate disappointment turns into pure excitement and I look at my father and my
1875480	1882240	mother and a tear is rolling out of my eye and I say, thank you so much.
1882240	1886180	And I put it on and it droops over you.
1886180	1889640	It is, the sleeves go past my hands.
1889640	1891680	It is at least two sizes too big.
1891680	1896240	And I look at him and I'm like, well we can take it back and exchange it for my size.
1896240	1900480	And your parents are staring at Ferguson.
1900480	1905280	He begins sobbing uncontrollably as he walks toward you.
1905280	1909900	Your father barks, emotion is weakness.
1909900	1911920	You need to be strong.
1911920	1913920	Take what is yours.
1913920	1917280	It's the only way to succeed.
1917280	1923360	Ferguson beans, wipes his tears away and takes the jacket from off your back, putting it
1923360	1926860	on and turning away from you.
1926860	1931540	It looks really cool on you, Ferguson.
1931540	1936900	And you wake up in the back of this ambulance, what are they called?
1936900	1937900	Ambulance people.
1937900	1938900	EMT.
1938900	1939900	The EMT.
1939900	1940900	Paramedic.
1940900	1942700	Oh, hey, you're back.
1942700	1943700	How are you feeling?
1943700	1944700	What?
1944700	1945700	What?
1945700	1946700	Ah.
1946700	1952660	And your nose is just super broken and you got blood splattered all over your chest.
1952660	1955900	Oh, hey, we can give you something for that.
1955940	1961580	He hands you a bunch of pills and you take them, I'm guessing.
1961580	1962580	Oh yeah.
1962580	1965460	Alright, so we're going to put you back up at one willpower.
1965460	1967580	So you're still at a negative twenty percent.
1967580	1973900	Go ahead and roll a D4 for me as he begins doing first aid on you.
1973900	1974900	Dose.
1974900	1975900	So you gain two hit points back.
1975900	1976900	Cool.
1976900	1978800	That puts me back up to twenty, I believe.
1978800	1980220	Do you think you can stand up?
1980220	1981700	How are you feeling?
1982020	1985780	Yeah, I think, I mean, my face just hurts.
1985780	1990860	It feels a lot better after that, thank you, but, you know, I think I just, I just took
1990860	1995380	a, I smelled some of that gas and stuff, it just kind of got to my head, but I, help me
1995380	1997020	up and let me see if I can.
1997020	1998180	Okay, for sure.
1998180	2004020	And he helps you up and he kicks over in the back of the ambulance and the scene is still
2004020	2005020	out there.
2005020	2009620	There, it's, I mean, it's not chaos anymore, but there are people running around all over
2009620	2011300	the place, taking care of business.
2011300	2015600	The fire has been put out, they're getting information, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2015600	2021700	You see John and Clark standing on the other side of John's cruiser, just ahead of you,
2021700	2023620	and you walk out of the back of the ambulance.
2023620	2024620	Cool.
2024620	2025620	What?
2025620	2026620	Whoop-de-de-scoop.
2026620	2045740	God damn it, I was, I almost put this through your eye, holding a mechanical pencil.
2045740	2047500	He's holding a mechanical pencil.
2047500	2052020	For the listeners, Thomas is holding a mechanical pencil that he threatened the life of Luke
2052020	2053020	with.
2053020	2054020	No, just the eye.
2054420	2055420	That's like my depth perception.
2055420	2056420	What's behind your eye?
2056420	2057420	Luke, you would look really cool.
2057420	2058420	Your brain.
2058420	2059420	No, I don't think I'd look cool with an eye patch.
2059420	2069120	I would have a fake eye, but I would get like an eight ball, no, a magic eight ball.
2069120	2073580	And when I like shook my head, I could, you know, answer your questions for you.
2073580	2074580	That's really good.
2074580	2081820	Okay, so John and, John and Clark are standing in front of John's police cruiser and you've
2081820	2084620	just had this revelation about who the body is.
2084620	2089940	When you guys look up and you see Keith Vigness stumbling out of the back of the ambulance.
2089940	2090940	Wow.
2090940	2091940	Hey, you guys.
2091940	2098060	You guys were in the slum room for a long time.
2098060	2102540	Just to set up that joke.
2102540	2108380	Real fast though, I did want to watch and see if the body of the driver came out of
2108380	2110860	the car before I was going to go over to John.
2110900	2112340	They haven't pulled anything out yet.
2112340	2113340	Okay.
2113340	2116860	Then yeah, I'll walk over to John and I now see that it's John Peters.
2116860	2117860	You do.
2117860	2119700	And you said fool was on his head.
2119700	2120700	Correct.
2120700	2125100	And that was from, we saw that when he was in the stock stocks in a picture that came
2125100	2126100	from the camera.
2126100	2127820	I'd like to feel for a pulse.
2127820	2129380	Roll first aid.
2129380	2130380	Fuck.
2130380	2132960	A 37 on a 30.
2132960	2134580	You feel no pulse.
2134580	2136460	Also, you killed him.
2136460	2138340	Good job, dude.
2138340	2141620	He is one with the vehicle.
2141620	2143180	He fell on his back.
2143180	2144180	He fell on his back.
2144180	2146020	Like his FAQ.
2146020	2147020	His FAQ back?
2147020	2149700	His FAQ bell in first.
2149700	2154820	So you would clearly see, well, it's not out of the ordinary for you to try to find a pulse,
2154820	2157100	but this body is extremely dead from what you can tell.
2157100	2158460	I want to look up in the sky.
2158460	2161100	Do I see any remnants of the stuff we saw earlier?
2161100	2162100	No.
2162100	2165740	Also, we were all in the room when it was being recorded, but John is the only one who
2165740	2168220	saw the body fall from the sky.
2168220	2169220	Oh really?
2169220	2171180	And all the stuff happened like around the sky.
2171180	2173380	I don't, I don't look up then.
2173380	2178220	Hopefully, John says, did you, did you see where this came from?
2178220	2184380	I mean, he must've been standing in the road when he fell from the sky.
2184380	2190620	I look up, you see a giant swirl.
2190620	2193900	Did you not see the clouds go crazy?
2193900	2194900	The clouds go crazy.
2195140	2199220	They were swirling all around and a technicolor light was coming from.
2199220	2202260	And then this motherfucker right here just fell on the head of my car.
2202260	2204780	I didn't, I didn't see any of that, John.
2204780	2205780	Can you feel my forehead?
2205780	2206780	Fuck.
2206780	2207780	I feel his forehead.
2207780	2208780	It's wet.
2208780	2209780	It's wet.
2209780	2210780	Warm, wet, or cold wet?
2210780	2211780	Warm, wet.
2211780	2212780	Warm, wet.
2212780	2213780	I'm not seeing things though, buddy.
2213780	2214780	I saw this.
2214780	2218420	I mean, I'm not, I'm not going to discount it just because of all the stuff we've seen,
2218420	2220060	but I didn't see it, my man.
2220060	2221060	Okay.
2221260	2226300	I'm just coming up and just now I'm noticing John Peter's body on the hood of your car,
2226300	2227300	in the hood of your car.
2227300	2228900	I, uh, I pat him on the shoulder.
2228900	2229900	Keith, you all right?
2229900	2230900	Oh, that hurts.
2230900	2231900	Please don't do that.
2231900	2232900	Ooh.
2232900	2233900	Ooh.
2233900	2234900	I'm very sore.
2234900	2235900	What, uh, what got you?
2235900	2241080	Oh, just a car wreck and passing out and hitting my head and, uh, I don't know how my nose
2241080	2246140	got broken, but somehow I fell on the back of my head and ended up with a broken nose.
2246140	2248180	So I assumed the airbag, right?
2248500	2250460	Oh man, so much stuff was flying around.
2250460	2251460	Who can tell really?
2251460	2252460	Oh yeah.
2252460	2253460	It's, it's weird.
2253460	2257780	I thought this would have maybe changed the way you talk or something.
2257780	2265300	I decided against doing that cause it's, it would be annoying for me to have to do.
2265300	2269100	Also I did it once and then immediately forgot to do it and I don't want to have to.
2269100	2271700	I don't want to have to go do that again.
2271700	2273020	Looking at you, are you bandaged?
2273020	2274600	Yeah, I'm bandaged up.
2274600	2280260	They gave me some medication so that I could just like stand talking and standing and walk
2280260	2281260	and stuff.
2281260	2285000	So I'm feeling beat up, but you know, definitely worse for wear.
2285000	2288620	But also I'm able to, yeah, like not feeling good.
2288620	2293400	So I go up to the body and I look down at it and I look up at both of you guys.
2293400	2297480	I'm like, wait, do you know who this is?
2297480	2299360	Who do you think it is?
2299360	2300360	Do you know who this is?
2300360	2302360	Who do you think it is?
2304600	2307800	Wait, would I not know who it is?
2307800	2310800	I would though, right?
2310800	2316840	I'm no fool, but I think this is John Peters.
2316840	2318600	And he moonwalks out of the scene.
2318600	2322920	We'll make a cop of this boy, yeah.
2322920	2325240	That's what a fool believes.
2325240	2328680	He puts his sunglasses on and you hear a scream from a distance.
2328680	2332600	I put my sunglasses on and then I take them off.
2332600	2341720	I want to get out my phone and take a picture, take a bunch of pictures even of this whole
2341720	2342720	scene.
2342720	2343720	Okay.
2343720	2347720	I need you all to roll sanity for me for this body being John Peters.
2347720	2351520	I say, hey Clark, is that for your spank bank?
2351520	2352520	I failed this.
2352520	2353520	I failed it too.
2353520	2354520	I failed it hard.
2354520	2356680	I don't even know what we're rolling for, but I definitely failed.
2356680	2357680	Sanity.
2357680	2358680	Yep.
2358680	2359680	71 on a 31.
2359680	2360680	And a 95.
2360680	2361680	63 on a 36.
2362080	2371560	For our fucking nerd listeners, who are all, for those of you who might be fucking nerds.
2371560	2374480	Likely all of you.
2374480	2375480	Roll a D4.
2375480	2377480	That's how much you each lose.
2377480	2378480	Yay.
2378480	2379480	Got that out.
2379480	2380480	One.
2380480	2381480	Fuck.
2381480	2382480	Four.
2382480	2383480	This was sanity?
2383480	2384480	Correct.
2384480	2387120	I am at sanity 32 with my breaking point at 31.
2387120	2392840	Clark lost four sanity, Keith lost four sanity, and John lost one sanity.
2392840	2394120	I don't remember if we talked about this.
2394120	2396280	I hit my breaking point last time.
2396280	2401800	Did we decide on something to go along with my other disorder?
2401800	2404960	We are going to worry about the disorders.
2404960	2408320	Once your psyche's really had time to stew on what fucked it up.
2408320	2409320	Exactly.
2409320	2410320	Gotcha.
2410320	2411320	Gotcha.
2411320	2412320	Gotcha.
2412320	2413320	Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.
2413320	2414320	What?
2414320	2415320	Got him.
2415320	2416320	Got him.
2416320	2420400	He got me pretty good.
2420400	2425720	That was a, dude, burn.
2425720	2427560	What kind of clothes is John Peters wearing?
2427560	2435240	John Peters is wearing a pair of jeans and a button down shirt.
2435240	2436240	Are they cool jeans?
2436240	2437240	No.
2437240	2439280	Am I able to get to his pockets?
2439280	2440280	Yes.
2440280	2441280	Hold on.
2441280	2450040	Luke just actually broke his nose on the mic.
2450040	2454400	Oh, this hurts really bad.
2454400	2457480	We'll get you that character voice.
2457480	2461600	If we have to break your nose for real, we'll get you that character voice.
2461600	2464480	I'm method acting for this podcast.
2464480	2466520	Luke just slammed his face into the wall.
2466520	2468920	To all 30, to all 30 listeners.
2468920	2469920	What would Leto do?
2469920	2470920	What would Leto do?
2471560	2473600	He just slammed his face.
2473600	2476000	I would like to search John Peters pockets.
2476000	2477200	Get police instincts.
2477200	2481920	They're full of cum.
2481920	2482920	You reach in.
2482920	2486920	Ew, it's cum, guys.
2486920	2490920	Oh, let me double check.
2490920	2494520	Yep, that's cum.
2494520	2495520	Give me some.
2495520	2497080	Keith, taste it.
2497080	2499800	Oh, he needs to change his diet.
2499800	2501600	There's nothing in his pockets.
2501600	2502600	Sorry.
2502600	2503600	Except cum.
2503600	2510360	He's a masochist and a skydiver.
2510360	2511840	I hope that makes it on.
2511840	2513040	It probably won't.
2513040	2517800	I crit success staying in the podcast.
2517800	2522760	You search John Peters' pockets and you don't find anything inside them.
2522760	2523760	Sorry.
2523760	2524760	Cummer.
2524760	2526160	I wish I could give you something here.
2526160	2528880	It just doesn't make any sense for him to have anything on him.
2528880	2536920	I was like, I wonder if you keep your wallet once you've transported to the goo plane.
2536920	2537920	Can I do a...
2537920	2538920	Wait, do I have forensics?
2538920	2539920	Okay, yeah.
2539920	2543200	I'm going to do a forensics roll to see how he died.
2543200	2545200	I think it was blunt trauma.
2545200	2547200	Hell yeah.
2547200	2550440	Wait, can we do that again?
2550440	2552000	Can we get a tight hell yeah on that?
2552000	2555100	This feels shitty, but yeah.
2555100	2558800	Can I do a roll to see if I can tell how he died?
2558800	2559800	Hell yeah.
2559800	2560800	All right.
2560800	2561800	Let's try to fight against...
2561800	2562800	Yeah.
2562800	2563800	He did pass his roll though.
2563800	2564800	How did he die?
2564800	2565800	Yeah, he did.
2565800	2566800	He did nail it.
2566800	2567800	It was 17 for that first roll.
2567800	2568800	Oh, was it?
2568800	2569800	Okay, cool.
2569800	2570800	Yeah, I have a zero in forensics though.
2570800	2571800	Oh, really?
2571800	2572800	Oh, fuck.
2572800	2573800	Oh, shit.
2573800	2585720	Yeah, I was just going to say that I pass it no matter what.
2585720	2587720	So an unusable bit.
2587720	2596040	Okay, so as you guys are standing around looking at the body in John's cruiser, you
2596040	2603680	see the firemen are pulling a woman's charred remains from the driver's seat of the minivan.
2603680	2604680	Is she hot?
2604680	2609460	Oh, she was.
2609460	2614280	Then you see two more firefighters and they're going into the back of the van.
2614280	2615280	Don't pull out a dog.
2615280	2617200	Pull out a kid, not a dog.
2617200	2620840	They pull out the body of a small girl.
2620840	2624440	Oh, we should have been a dog.
2624440	2626600	Go ahead and roll sanity for me.
2626600	2627600	Pass.
2627600	2628600	Fail.
2628600	2630600	42 on a 30.
2630600	2632600	The crit failed.
2632600	2634400	I rolled 100.
2634400	2635400	It was your daughter.
2635400	2638280	This is going to stack nicely with...
2638280	2641600	Hey, remember how smoothly the first half of this went?
2641600	2648360	So John, you lose one sanity, Clark, you lose two sanity, and Keith, you lose no sanity.
2648360	2650600	That makes me hit my breaking point.
2650600	2653640	32 now, I'm at 30 with a breaking point of 31.
2653640	2654640	How do I recalculate that again?
2654640	2655640	I always forget.
2655640	2659800	So you're at 30 now, and so you subtract your power, which is 12.
2659800	2661620	From that breaking point, right?
2661620	2662800	From your current sanity.
2662800	2663800	Oh, okay.
2663800	2667680	So if you go past your breaking point, it starts over from where your sanity is currently.
2667680	2668680	Gotcha, cool.
2669680	2673800	We all know is 18, and I didn't use my calculator for that.
2673800	2677920	Joe, I'm bad at math, and that one's a little sad.
2677920	2682520	The only reason I didn't lose sanity is because I am a terrible police officer, and I was
2682520	2685520	not paying attention at all.
2685520	2686520	Perfect.
2686520	2690400	You're trying to figure out how to pick your nose in a nose cast?
2690400	2695040	No, they popped my nose back into place and said, don't let your coworkers fall on you.
2695400	2698920	What if they put one of those clear masks over your face?
2698920	2702600	It's like when you have to play basketball, yeah, yeah.
2702600	2703600	Perfect.
2703600	2711200	Because I was too busy messing with the clear face mask they put over me to not break my
2711200	2712880	nose.
2712880	2716840	The cone that they put on me, dog.
2716840	2724960	What if they gave you a gun on both of his hands so that he can't scratch his face?
2724960	2729320	I'm wearing the clear face mask and cones over my nose.
2729320	2730320	No.
2730320	2732520	We're turning him into a monster.
2732520	2733520	Too funny.
2733520	2734520	Oh, man.
2734520	2735840	No, just ridiculous.
2735840	2740800	I'm guessing that you are going to need- We're going to need new cars.
2740800	2741800	New cars.
2741800	2743360	Good thing we're not out of town yet.
2743360	2746600	Thankfully, Keith's Cruiser is still at the police department.
2746600	2747600	True that.
2747600	2749720	Let's call Drew and have it bring it to us.
2749720	2750720	Grab it.
2750720	2753160	Bring it to us.
2753160	2754160	We respect you, Drew.
2754160	2757000	I put a lot of emotion into that character.
2757000	2760080	You can't just call him an it.
2760080	2761880	Have the fang bring us.
2761880	2766880	Also, the Chief's Cruiser is still feasible, so we could just steal hers.
2766880	2768360	She's not going to be using it.
2768360	2770240	Yeah, stealing's an interesting way to put it.
2770240	2771240	Well, not steal.
2771240	2772240	Utilize.
2772240	2773240	We can certainly utilize.
2773240	2776840	It's still police department property.
2776840	2781280	When we call Drew, can we also have him get a tow truck and bring in our cruisers and
2781280	2784000	maybe start working on fixing them bad boys back in shape?
2784000	2787760	Well, we could also, instead of this mill thing, we could just go to the cruiser store.
2787760	2791360	Wait, also, didn't we fix the four wheeler?
2791360	2792360	That is true.
2792360	2793840	Drew did fix the four wheeler.
2793840	2795900	I want to drive the four wheeler.
2795900	2796900	Around town?
2796900	2798120	I mean, following you guys.
2798120	2800400	We're going to be on the highway and stuff, man.
2800400	2803720	I'll attach a rope to the front of my four wheeler.
2803720	2804720	Put it in neutral.
2804720	2805720	Put it in neutral.
2805720	2806720	Have you?
2806720	2808520	No, Keith, you're going to have to ride with us.
2808520	2809520	I'm sorry.
2809520	2810520	Yeah, good, because my drive is-
2810760	2813880	Hey buddy, we'll have more four wheel adventures real soon.
2813880	2814880	Okay.
2814880	2816800	Should we do anything more with John Peters?
2816800	2819360	I feel like there's a lot more we need to do.
2819360	2820840	Autopsy, for sure.
2820840	2821840	Just get a coroner out there?
2821840	2823360	I mean, send him to the coroner.
2823360	2825240	Yeah, if we take him to the coroner.
2825240	2829000	Load him up in the tow truck.
2829000	2831040	So the coroner isn't counting.
2831040	2834160	Is that where the cruiser repair shop is too?
2834160	2839600	No, you guys, there's a place in town that Drew will have your cruisers towed to.
2839600	2844680	What if we send John Peters to the repair shop and see what they can do?
2844680	2847720	Work your magic, boys.
2847720	2850540	Bit of a special request this time.
2850540	2853480	You did say he was part of the car now.
2853480	2857280	Man, they're going to overcharge you for those.
2857280	2858540	Oh, that's true.
2858540	2859540	We are going to have to like, yeah.
2859540	2860540	Yeah, put it on our tab.
2860540	2862560	He's going to need some extraction.
2862560	2864560	It's a lot of body work.
2864560	2865560	Hey!
2865560	2866560	Hell yeah.
2866560	2873880	Podcast over.
2873880	2882880	This has been pretending to be people with Zach Thomas, Luke, and our star, Joe Terry.
2882880	2885000	Thank you.
2885000	2886920	Thank you.
2886920	2888060	Okay.
2888060	2890060	And then let's have the cruisers towed.
2890060	2892640	We can ride with the tow truck back to...
2892640	2895000	Or we could have Drew drive the cruiser to us.
2895400	2897200	And then he could ride with the tow truck back.
2897200	2898200	That's true.
2898200	2899960	Also, the tow tump...
2899960	2903600	The tow truck company is called Towed Truck and they just have a towed logo.
2903600	2904600	Oh, of course.
2904600	2905600	Love it.
2905600	2906600	I like it.
2906600	2907800	And the frog has huge toes.
2907800	2910200	Yeah, that's why it's a toad.
2910200	2914120	Anyway, so yeah, he brings the cruiser up here.
2914120	2916680	We all hop in my cruiser.
2916680	2921160	And then, well, I would say we would go to the mill, but do you want to push us in a
2921160	2923880	certain direction?
2923880	2929240	Ouch, and yes.
2929240	2934720	So Drew comes rolling up in Keith Vigna's police cruiser.
2934720	2941480	He gets out and he looks at all three of you suspiciously and he says...
2941480	2943480	It's pronounced specifically.
2943480	2946480	One, two, three.
2946480	2948480	Bubble gum tree.
2948480	2949480	Bubble gum tree.
2949480	2950480	Bubble gum tree.
2950960	2951960	Let's try that one more time.
2951960	2953160	I forgot what it actually was.
2953160	2954160	Bubble gum tree.
2954160	2957000	Okay, I think we're good.
2957000	2958000	What happened here?
2958000	2959120	I mean, you don't have to tell me now.
2959120	2963480	I'll see the paperwork later when I fill it out, but that, I mean, this looks crazy.
2963480	2968760	Well, John Peters fell out of the sky causing me to lose control of my patrol vehicle, which
2968760	2971620	careened across the highway into oncoming traffic.
2971620	2975800	And because of that, two civilians are dead and another is seriously injured and Keith's
2975800	2978760	penis fell off and he broke his nose.
2978760	2981120	For the record, my penis is still attached.
2981120	2982600	Oh, they got that back on.
2982600	2983600	I don't know.
2983600	2984600	That was a weird joke to make.
2984600	2986320	It kind of makes me mad since...
2986320	2987640	You were screaming and my penis fell off.
2987640	2988640	I don't know.
2988640	2991640	I probably have a concussion.
2991640	2992640	I don't know.
2992640	2993640	That might make sense.
2993640	2995800	Keith, is your penis okay?
2995800	2999080	I unbuckle my big britches.
2999080	3005120	I unbuckle my big britches, open them up about a foot past my stomach and I look at it and
3005120	3006760	I'm like, yep, it's on there.
3006760	3007760	Okay, thank goodness.
3007760	3014840	Okay, so guys, I hate to do this, but I just got a call from the estate salesman and he's
3014840	3023840	at James's house and he found some unsettling writing in blood and many guns after accidentally
3023840	3027520	triggering some sort of secret door-like trap.
3027520	3032560	So he's wondering if he can sell the guns in the estate sale.
3032560	3038040	I told him probably not, but that you guys would go over and check it out because it
3038040	3042560	seems like it might be a crime scene, what with the weird blood writing and such.
3042560	3044160	Who was James?
3044160	3045160	He was the waiter guy.
3045160	3046160	He said see you later guy.
3046160	3047160	That's what I thought.
3047160	3048160	Yeah.
3048160	3050800	He wasn't good enough for us.
3050800	3057560	Also, he had his foot missing in the explosion radio and he was also the guy with the vacuum.
3057560	3060540	Wait, was James the one over the table?
3060540	3063900	He was the one hunched over the table, foot missing.
3063900	3066140	Also the guy with the vacuum in the neighborhood.
3066140	3067540	And was he eating a plate of foot?
3067540	3072660	He had a plate of foot in front of him, but we don't know if he was eating it.
3072660	3073660	Oh yeah.
3073660	3076180	Have we ever had the coroners looked at if those feet matched?
3076180	3077700	Well, they blew up.
3077700	3078700	Remember?
3078700	3079700	Oh, man.
3079700	3080700	Okay.
3080700	3081700	Again, Joe fucking up.
3081700	3084980	But back at that house, you walked in and it was Maggie?
3084980	3089300	Maggie was dead, stabbed in the face to death with a foot missing.
3089340	3096340	James slumped at the table with the foot meat or whatever, shot in the head, his foot missing.
3096340	3097340	Holding a gun.
3097340	3098340	Holding a gun.
3098340	3099340	And a fork.
3099340	3105980	Drew passed out and the Harold Dorsey of what'sbehinddorsey.tumblr.com.
3105980	3108160	By the way guys, I know who did it.
3108160	3109160	Don't tell us.
3109160	3110160	We got to figure it out.
3110160	3111160	Don't tell us.
3111160	3114380	A guy with a scar over his eye and a gun.
3114380	3117960	An overweight guy wearing all black with a scar over his eye.
3117960	3119520	And we have not seen that guy since.
3119520	3120520	No.
3120520	3121520	Correct.
3121520	3122520	Okay.
3122520	3123520	That's what I was trying to remember.
3123520	3124520	Okay.
3124520	3128480	After Drew says all that, he kind of looks at John Lee Pettymore.
3128480	3130920	Hey, can we talk for a minute right now?
3130920	3132280	Yeah, it'd probably be best.
3132280	3133280	Okay, sure.
3133280	3134280	Yeah.
3134280	3135280	What's up, buddy?
3135280	3139040	And so he kind of pulls you over to the side of the road, maybe off the ditch in the side
3139040	3140040	of the road.
3140040	3141040	Do you guys want to head out?
3147960	3148960	Hey, John.
3148960	3149960	Yeah, buddy.
3149960	3150960	What's up?
3150960	3151960	Hey.
3151960	3153680	So, um, I got a message from the Duke.
3153680	3154680	Oh yeah.
3154680	3155920	What is, what's it say?
3155920	3157640	The deal is going down tonight.
3157640	3158920	Well, what time?
3158920	3160400	Uh, 2am.
3160400	3164560	Whatever, whoever sent it to me said the location will be sent later tonight.
3164560	3165560	All right.
3165560	3169840	I just wanted to give you a heads up, obviously, and not really text about it like we talked
3169840	3170840	about before.
3170840	3175520	Man, you've got great, I had to say this, consider it a lot of work, but great.
3175520	3176520	Criminal instincts.
3176520	3177520	Thank you.
3178080	3179080	I have to think I learned quickly.
3179080	3183280	You know, also, around here, this is just more general rascalism than actually criminal.
3183280	3184280	Oh.
3184280	3185280	That's the way the Pettimores look at it.
3185280	3186280	Absolutely.
3186280	3189400	No, I mean, if we didn't sell these drugs, someone else would.
3189400	3191480	All right, I need, I want you to try something.
3191480	3192480	Okay.
3192480	3195880	And if you can pull this off, I'll give you 5% of my share.
3195880	3196880	Okay.
3196880	3197880	All right.
3197880	3200880	I want you to try to negotiate with the Duke and say, hey man, we're the ones with the
3200880	3202280	drugs.
3202280	3206880	We picked the location and I wanted to come out to my farm where we got the drugs buried.
3207240	3208240	Okay.
3208240	3209240	Sounds good.
3209240	3210240	You're a good man.
3210240	3211240	That's perfect.
3211240	3213240	What should we say we were talking about?
3213240	3214240	Um.
3214240	3215240	I'll wing it.
3215240	3216240	I'll figure it out.
3216240	3217240	Okay.
3217240	3218240	Sounds good.
3223240	3229360	Keith and Clark, what are you guys talking about when John and Drew go walk off into
3229360	3230360	the ditch?
3230360	3231360	Hey, dude.
3231360	3234040	I know, like, I'm really sore.
3234040	3239640	I remember not losing consciousness in the car and my nose definitely wasn't broken.
3239640	3241200	Like how, how did that happen?
3241200	3245400	Oh, I mean, we, we slammed into the back of John's pretty fucking hard.
3245400	3249080	I remember that, but I remember crawling out of the window with my nose intact.
3249080	3250080	I don't remember that.
3250080	3251080	My man.
3251080	3252080	Can I do a human on?
3252080	3256160	Well, hey, Clark didn't actually see this, but I like that you think this is going to
3256160	3259440	somehow possibly make up at all.
3259520	3263280	Like meet me on the same level as trashing my house.
3263280	3265520	That's really exactly what I'm going for.
3265520	3266520	Yeah.
3266520	3267520	Not going to work.
3267520	3269520	He's probably going to break it again.
3269520	3275840	No, uh, Keith, I heard you smash out the window, but I was, I was occupied trying to get myself
3275840	3277320	out of my side.
3277320	3278800	I don't, I don't know what happened.
3278800	3279800	Hey.
3279800	3282000	Well also they told me that you saved that kid.
3282000	3283000	So good on you for that.
3283000	3284000	That was good.
3284000	3287920	I just, I just jumped, you know, I mean, it's a shame you couldn't save the other people,
3287920	3289360	but I don't think that's on you.
3289360	3292960	And I put my arm around Clark and I comfort him just a little bit.
3292960	3295600	I think I'll be hearing those screams for a while though.
3295600	3302700	I'm glad I was unconscious for it because that would fuck me up.
3302700	3307720	As you guys are finishing up this conversation, Drew and John walk back toward you.
3307720	3313200	So as, as I walk up, I like slap a big hand on Keith's back and I'm like, Hey man, really
3313200	3314480	sorry about the nose.
3314480	3319040	I was rushing over, trying to give you some existence and I, uh, I tripped on your big
3319040	3322040	pants and kind of need you right in the face there.
3322040	3325200	I'm really sorry about that, buddy, but you know, I, I didn't mean anything by it.
3325200	3327760	You know, just the, the, it's the thought that counts.
3327760	3332640	So I, you know, I appreciate you trying to help me cause I know I can't do anything to
3332640	3333640	hurt me.

3334640	3339040	I know that I was about to say like, you know, I'm a, I don't know if I would have done the
3339040	3340080	same thing for you.
3340080	3342840	Not out of spite, but out of pure fear.
3342840	3345080	I mean, yeah, I would have definitely helped you too.
3345080	3346080	Sorry.
3346080	3347080	Forget.

3349080	3351640	Uh, John isn't like thinking about your faux pas.
3351640	3354600	He's just like, did Keith call me brave?
3354600	3355760	Yeah.
3355760	3362240	As you guys are having this conversation, Drew says, Oh my, Oh my God, what is that?
3362240	3369400	And you guys see an extremely wet black cat running toward you from the water.
3370400	3379080	And the extremely wet black cat jumps up onto your leg, John, and it's like,
3379080	3382560	I bring him up to my face and I say, hold on, Doug, we're going to get you the help
3382560	3383560	you need.
