323440	329120	there's some sort of what is that it's it's like savory it's in the air there's a sweetness to it
329760	334320	and your eyes begin to adjust you see there's a pool of blood on the floor

397680	408960	like with his first actions as not a giant robot ball like the the just like sheer mundane humanness
408960	413600	of his own movements sends an existential depression through john lee pettymore
416160	419920	at while at the same time like eliciting a comforting nostalgia but he's like

781840	787280	we'll choose which phobia you would like to take and let's go ahead and uh do you want to make this
787280	791760	a secret and have them leave the room if you want yeah let's do that get on out of here boys we're
791840	795680	just gonna start guessing random fears and throwing them at you throughout the campaign
796240	800000	it might become depending on what it is it could be real obvious real quick
801520	812080	all right joe roll d100 for me a 45 45 is going to be herpetophobia which is the fear of reptiles
812080	818320	it's fun that would have worked out well last arc are fish people reptiles yeah i don't know
818960	827680	no uh 50 50 is iatrophobia which is the fear of doctors
829600	834320	uh for story reasons that'd be great for uh role-playing game reasons that'd be awful
835200	842960	and the third one let's see what you roll here a 46 46 i did 45 50 46 oh weird uh
843680	850160	homoclophobia which is the fear of fog fear of fog fog i mean joe would love to take that one
850160	854960	would you let me take that one yeah i don't know if it would ever come up if i mean we'll we'll see
854960	860000	it would be fun when it came up if it came up to be afraid of fog yeah let's make it happen i like
860000	864000	that yeah yeah let's go with fear of fog that's fun all right we'll get the other boys in here
864000	868240	wait am i still do i still think i'm god because that was i think what i got when i broke in the
868240	873120	mausoleum the first time what do you think well i never played it very well so i'll leave it up
873120	879040	to you do you want another shot at it oh another time that to be better at playing it sure uh
879040	882320	i mean i'll give it a shot i'm worried that i wasn't good at it because i never remembered
882320	886160	it we'll see let's yeah let's try it okay yeah i'll try and keep it into both of them all right
886160	891600	cool thinking he's god is so antithetical to the way i like created clark it's really hard to play
891600	896800	him that actually makes sense well that's i part of the whole point of this game right is to have
896800	902080	a character that just delves into madness and darkness i'll try and dig a little deeper for
902080	921200	you babe oh thank you just tap that well tap that dark viscous well and pump it out i dig it
921200	930400	so you guys are all looking at each other in the darkness you see the blood splattered on each
930400	935600	other you're having all these memories flashback and you remember everything that already happened
935600	941920	and you remember being here keith rips his shirt off to see if the same words are still branded
941920	947920	when you rip your shirt off the first thing that you see is the word marvin that was burned into
947920	955200	the flesh of your chest has a strike through it it is completely crossed out looking around at
955200	961280	the other burn marks that you remember from last time tilde is still written inside your dominant
961280	966800	palm it's not crossed out each of you kind of check each other drew is burned into the flesh
966800	970560	on your backs it's not crossed out i was planning on getting one of those anyway so
970560	980800	a drew brand yeah for the boys and maggie is burned into each of your left feet the bottom
980800	988640	of your left foot says maggie and clark as you saw last time and the other two saw as well the
988640	995280	flesh on the bottom of your left foot has been eaten away in the symbol of the circle of knowledge
995520	1000880	but her name is not crossed out that is correct what about our injuries sustained like fighting
1000880	1007120	the robot and things those injuries are not a part of your body do you do you fellas think it
1007120	1013920	think it all happened did it happen i want to go back i want to go back at the juggernaut we we we
1013920	1021600	we saw marvin die and now now his name's crossed out oh i mean we're back here we're back we're
1021600	1025600	back now i don't know i don't know what i don't know what it means i mean to really get to the
1025600	1030720	bottom of it we'd have to go figure out if he's dead right now or not what if we i think we should
1030720	1035760	just go take care of this other shit cross brands off our body we lost other people in there is
1035760	1039280	there somebody is there some way we could we don't have to figure out marvin's there now just
1039280	1043840	something we did between now and what we remember that we could check on we're at the funeral right
1043840	1050000	now right yeah there's ari's body right there you see that ari's body is inside the coffin
1050000	1054320	were the agents at that funeral did we notice them i didn't look around and see if they're
1054320	1061840	here peeking your head out you see the the sun is shining and uh it is scarce you see the bodies
1061840	1068400	of three men that you fought they're the men with the scars on their faces and necks wearing all
1068400	1074880	black and their bodies are still strewn across the makeshift stage of ari manstein's funeral
1074880	1081040	what happened rosemary yeah did we see her die first i need an intelligence check from
1081040	1085040	whoever has the highest intelligence i think it's me 75.
1087760	1094000	79 oh do you want to do you want to spend four luck in order to succeed on this check i'll spend
1094000	1104800	two luck life isn't always a highway thomas um no i'm comfortable feeling that okay
1105680	1109920	luck is a precious resource for me right now i only have 20 joe and luke the last time you
1109920	1116320	saw rosemary was when you were standing on top of water right and she reached for the gun
1117120	1122880	john lee pettymore wasn't there but clark bishop oh yeah keith vigno were then why did i roll the
1122880	1127360	chest that was it for a different piece of information gotcha do we have a way to contact
1127360	1133280	rosemary a better piece of information i don't yeah i mean i've got our number do i have kevin's
1133280	1139680	cell phone yeah like yeah but it might be weird me and uh keith saw rosemary die in glass's office
1139680	1144720	so if she answers the phone we'll know that whatever we did didn't didn't happen i don't
1144720	1147920	know i don't know i don't know how any of this works well let's just doesn't happen let's just
1147920	1155680	assume that some happen somehow he is dead and we did kill him what do we do now i mean start
1155680	1159680	crossing off more names yeah the name got crossed off that's do we need to kill maggie
1159680	1167440	and drew that seems odd are we supposed to not be crossing names off we ain't got no cause to
1167440	1174640	harm tility maybe we just happen to kill one but the other ones we just gotta make go to some
1177680	1183360	we gotta send them on a vacation away from here i'm tired of this damn game we're playing
1183600	1191760	it's like our lives are decided on the rolls of dice well we we could go we could go try to find
1191760	1196720	drew why don't all right i'm gonna call rosemary and we'll see if we've taken her out of all
1196720	1202720	existences in worlds or just the one we can also if she's still alive we'll just call her back in
1202720	1210880	an hour and see if she see if she's dead then then we can get an idea of the the causality that's
1210880	1214320	going on around us i mean we should yeah let's go ahead and do that but i'm starting to wonder if
1214320	1219040	it even matters if the name is crossed off on our chest and like we just don't we just don't mess
1219040	1230640	with marvin this time what if we just walk away from all like possible loose ends and in like
1231200	1237840	three months x like no marvin's just been building his crime empire you didn't call rosemary so he
1237840	1245040	lived uh i'm gonna call rosemary okay would you like to put it on yeah all right there it is and
1245040	1256480	then we have taylor yeah click all right we'll try that again in an hour and i text rosemary sorry
1256480	1264720	but though okay you get a call back but then it immediately goes away because she sees the time
1264720	1270880	yeah exactly happens all too often okay well i like the idea maybe maybe here in an hour or so
1271600	1276800	all that might be going down did we need anything else from marvin because if that somehow is all
1276800	1281040	going down right now we could it's a huge distraction have we asked ourselves what we
1281040	1286080	even got from marvin in the first place it feels to me we're more lost now than ever well that's
1286640	1291680	yeah so we went we went over there to see i haven't been clark in a while
1292080	1303120	oh yeah we went down to the goddamn marvin glasses scrap pittin uh we went we went up there to figure
1303120	1308320	out if uh cousin fucking good time what his plans were for contention and we were going to stop him
1308880	1312880	and i mean if his name is crossed off on her chest maybe we stopped him maybe we stopped his
1312880	1319040	evil plans he did kind of clue us in on that right what was that zack what were his plans
1319040	1324640	for contention i think he told us right i believe that clark bishop and keith vigno were in the room
1324640	1330560	and got to ask a few questions of marvin glass i don't know if we ever asked him about kevin
1330560	1336560	oh kevin asked and then they were just like you idiot like you know do you remember much about
1336560	1340160	that conversation i don't remember i remember that i remember the big one i asked him that's
1340160	1345280	the interesting thing about being alive and dying and then being alive again is it's really hard to
1345280	1351360	remember some stuff listeners that feels that feels like a lifetime ago well do we still have
1351360	1356880	the gun at this point or no i mean theoretically marvin would have it still because we there was
1356880	1361040	another thing that we were going to get right because he had it i don't think no no he wanted
1361040	1366560	us to bring the gun to him yeah oh well no we did yeah and then we got in cages and then we died the
1366560	1374800	first time man if only there was some kind of let's say app like discord where interested parties
1374800	1381520	could clue us in on what we might be missing if you have any notions on what leads we should be
1381520	1388800	pursuing just head on over to the pretended to be people discord help your boys out where is the gun
1388800	1394880	zach marvin glass as far as you know marvin glass is in possession of the gun that is what your
1394880	1401600	vision john kevin lee pettymore showed you right after the funeral of ari manstein yes earlier
1401600	1409360	today that is correct okay remind the listeners of what happened in that uh vision it was a
1409360	1415840	television screen that's all i remember did it have yours it had your uh my little
1415840	1423200	culture and what letters yeah i remembered mine john as your eyes roll backward your vision goes
1423200	1430640	dark images begin flashing through your mind just snippets moments and you try to keep up as the
1430640	1439840	speed of the sequence waxes and wanes you see a motel safe shiny black and closed you see the sign
1439840	1447120	for beans pond the little pond behind chief maggie cook's house in contention you see a television
1447120	1456320	it is blinking with different letters on it r s t l n e you see a small clearing in the woods
1456320	1464480	and the ground is scorched in a dark room lit by various electronics and machines you see a
1464480	1472160	massive shiny metal sphere 20 feet tall with silvery arms extending from either side
1472880	1480080	a tube connects this gargantuan ball to a machine below the machine begins whirring and you see a
1480080	1487120	small metal sphere roughly one inch in diameter begin moving up through the tubing into the larger
1487120	1494400	armed version of itself as this happens a vast circle opens up in the ceiling and a disorienting
1494400	1500240	amount of light and sound pours into the room revealing text painted on the back wall that
1500240	1508080	says the same thing you hear violently chanted by an unseen crowd planet juggernaut
1510080	1516160	the scene changes again and you see marvin glass standing at his desk in the grand room you
1516160	1523680	recently stood in as kevin alongside rosemary marvin is holding the odd camera with glass tubes
1523680	1530800	closely inspecting it tapping its lit red luminaire on his desk are two file folders
1531360	1540160	two file folders splayed open entitled the real files on clark bishop and keith vigna
1540160	1548560	contention police officers you can see in keith's file are various clippings about the beans family
1548560	1556080	the tragic the tragic accidental deaths of william and lena keith's parents the takeover of the
1556080	1562800	family business by ferguson in clark's file there is a newspaper article about the murderer who
1562800	1572160	killed clark bishop's parents and love there is a mugshot of a woman smiling a cold vacant smile
1572160	1578560	behind asymmetrical bangs covering one of her eyes written in sharpie underneath the mugshot
1578560	1586000	it says in all caps karen as he kind of remembers and comes out of it just like planet juggernaut
1586000	1590080	planet juggernaut is still kind of ringing in his ears and they just see like a single
1590080	1596000	tear go down his eye and like touch the the faint smile on his lips john you all right
1597600	1604480	yeah yeah man i'm fine i just miss an old friend well i've i've kind of got an idea
1605120	1610160	marvin has the gun and the camera if we think our actions might be permanent
1610160	1616080	like our old actions in this world like they'll happen here and later on in the day let's just
1616080	1621120	hang around town until afterwards slip on in after everybody's dead take that gun and camera
1621120	1626960	and then head on back to contention i'd get a burger or something in the meantime you're quite
1626960	1631120	full john lee pedemore was always down for a burger what if we somehow interfered with what
1631120	1636080	we had already done if we do that that's why we wait but we would be here now wouldn't wouldn't
1636080	1643200	we i look around i mean wouldn't we be here now if we if the motion was still going forward in time
1643200	1648720	back then well this isn't where we came back into the world i'm this isn't when we came back into
1648720	1655280	the world like look out there what happened at the funeral's already happened what's your point
1655280	1662560	i think the bottom line is that let's say let's say old clark me in the future put these brands
1662560	1669840	on us they set us into a tizzy and we went over and did stuff against marvin and then we woke up
1669840	1676400	back here where old me has put brands on us and marvin is crossed out so maybe he's trying to tell
1676400	1681680	us not to worry about marvin anymore and go after something else on our body list yeah i mean it
1681680	1687680	seems that way well one thing i was thinking in your vision you had beans pond was in it right
1687680	1694640	yeah i remember when i got that watch from my brother when i put it on i had a vision of of
1694640	1700800	digging through dirt and mud and and finding like a door or something in the ground and for some
1700800	1706160	reason i just think i just feel like i i ought to go get that watch and we maybe we should go to
1706160	1711040	beans pond and i think there's something there for us you still have that watch oh it's in it's
1711040	1718400	in my safe at my uh at my hotel room hotel motel hotel motel i mean if we want to just choose a
1718400	1723600	course and go that's that's our first most readily available i mean and i feel more comfortable
1723600	1728000	putting it back on with you guys around because it was making me go crazy you were seeing you
1728000	1733440	were seeing things keith when you put it i felt like i wasn't i was in a different dimension or
1734480	1739280	universe or timeline or something i had to take it off because it was i felt like i could have
1739280	1744160	got stuck there but with you guys watching me you'd be able to you know make sure nothing too
1744160	1749520	bad happened and i think maybe if i put it on around beans pond i might be able to remember
1749520	1753840	exactly where i was digging or it might show me something else but it's the only thing i can think
1753840	1759920	of and i don't i mean i just came from fighting planet juggernaut and dealing with marvin already
1759920	1764560	i don't really feel like doing that again let's say we do that can you think of what name on our
1764560	1769840	body that might relate to well if it's in contention it could be maggie or drew i mean
1769840	1774400	i feel like also uh we'll find out what name is connected to when we get to the pond yeah plus
1774400	1779200	it's in contention so it could be maggie or drew we see tilde waiting for us beneath the door like
1779200	1785040	holding a gun like you've discovered my brilliant plan detectives yeah you haven't heard her voice
1785040	1797120	yet but that's definitely it so i mean the last we heard from drew was that that creepy
1797120	1802080	voicemail what voicemail was that just said don't go back to contention yeah when's the last time
1802080	1809680	he listened to drew i mean we got his name printed on us and you know he's our co-worker he's our
1809680	1814640	he's our friend i feel like if he was in trouble we might as well go back and try to find him and
1815280	1820000	investigate this this watch i didn't do this last time but i could check in with maggie
1820000	1826320	my my job here was to kill stan manstein and i did that and last time she said i'd have some
1826320	1831040	downtime between here and there if i wanted to help you guys whatever but get a hold of her this
1831040	1836000	time i guess i could call her and say shit's fucked up yeah call her tell her i mean you
1836000	1840640	basically did your job you check back in with her see tell her what happened but don't tell her that
1840640	1845840	her name's on your foot but i can tell her about the future past i don't know if you trust her i
1845840	1851040	don't know i guess i could just not say just check in and tell her that stan's dead and see what she
1851040	1856400	says can you summon old clark anyway i just like thinking real hard about wheel of fortune or
1856400	1865680	clark does that and he's like i want to return to this point in the future now clark roll unnatural
1866560	1870320	set a reminder on your cell phone for 50 years from now
1874560	1879840	oh no that's a crit fail you're gonna lose six sanity
1881760	1888240	fuck see you later boys what are you down to now at the start of this next venture
1888320	1896320	clark becomes a raven lunatic i'm at nine oh shit dude okay so what's your breaking point
1896320	1903360	three oh good you're 60 away from the phone number what did you roll oh it's a crit fail
1903360	1908000	so we're gonna call that the over the power situation god damn it
1910400	1916320	are we gonna you're still in this dark space i the door to the mausoleum is open and so there's
1916320	1922240	light shining in but this tomb is you know small crowded you three are in there there's a coffin
1922240	1926480	on the ground what do you do oh this fucking sucks uh because this happened last time so it
1926480	1934320	happens again uh i charged john screaming why'd you make me call oh clark that's the stupidest
1934320	1941600	thing i ever heard keith remembers this from last time i kind of step in the way put my foot out
1941600	1946800	trying to trip him while he's running it john and i roll dodge okay perfect go ahead and roll
1946800	1957040	dexterity luke that is a fail what is your dodge thomas well it's a lot lower than 89 which is what
1957040	1962640	i rolled so and joe go ahead and roll unarmed combat for me this part didn't happen because
1962640	1970640	you shot me last time i'm glad we've reached a new level in our relationship that's shooting from the
1970640	1974640	hip to the hip isn't it it's readily available
1977360	1981680	unarmed combat so i fail my hell yeah okay the three of you all trip onto the ground
1982800	1988480	in a pile on top of each other all three of you are in a pile on top of the coffin like
1990640	1993040	i gave ari a kiss on the cheek goodbye ew
1995360	1998480	that was horrible inappropriate why'd you say that
1999040	2002480	clark's in the middle of it probably right yeah i was charging you you'd probably fall
2002480	2007680	on me and fell no i fell on the bottom i was trying to trip you up if i'm on the top i get
2007680	2011920	up and kind of i don't um that happened last time i don't i don't know what it is about being in
2011920	2016560	this mausoleum i just it gets me every time while he's disoriented i draw my gun and fire
2016560	2029520	oh no into the air to calm things down i i walk outside the mausoleum to get a breath of fresh
2029520	2036080	air so does clark after that you finally fully make your way out of ari manstein's mausoleum
2036080	2042320	and the sun is beating down on this frigid december day aside from the three android men
2042320	2048320	bodies you notice the crawfish boil still going strong and then there's that old lady in a
2048320	2053920	wheelchair who's like trying to get out of here as fast as she can it's taking a while but only
2053920	2060240	because she's super old do you want let's help her keith is doing some weird gymnastics in his
2060240	2068320	head he's like if rosemary's still alive but she's dead and we came back in time but what we did
2068320	2078640	still counted does it matter if we help this old lady yes by your own questioning emphatically yes
2079840	2087600	if what happened still happened when you guys approach this old woman she looks at you with
2087600	2097360	wide eyes what what hey lady did you by chance see us come through here earlier
2099600	2103360	what is happening ma'am you look like you've seen us before
2105200	2111120	you you came through you you walked through and then you you didn't walk back in you walked
2111120	2116800	through you didn't walk back in no no we walked back in we walked back in it's roll psychotherapy
2116800	2126720	for me what about persuade you can roll persuade yeah it's fun 97 oh and you knew it you know
2127680	2138320	you know that you've been who are you i show her the name marvin like crossed out on like the burn
2138320	2144480	and i'm like that's the last person who asked me too many questions demons demons you're all
2144480	2150640	demons and she rolls as slowly as possible away from you well we definitely didn't help this old
2150640	2155120	lady but we got some questions so what did you what did she mean she said we we went and walked
2155120	2159840	out and then she saw us come out a second time without going back in that means that means we
2159840	2165840	are already on our way good so maybe we should just fucking hang around until after we see
2165840	2171440	planet juggernaut burst out of that pit with ye boys on its back and then we just go in and
2171440	2177520	collect do you think we can just get into the audience maybe well i mean we risk getting froze
2177520	2184080	we just won't we just won't sit in that section i know which section it was the butterfly i mean
2184880	2191520	oh i have disguise i could i could dress up as a little kid since it's family night did you
2191520	2196400	just spoiler this for us you said the butterfly effect that means we weren't there the first time
2196400	2203760	haha i haven't seen it okay keith is pretty steadfast on this me dressing up as a kid
2203760	2211760	idea is there a particular reason it's family night so we could we could blend in better it's
2211760	2217040	not what i meant we escaped we all got out of there fine what if we let us take care of us do
2217040	2221600	something else i mean let them do their job but we need to find the way yeah we need to find the
2221600	2227120	camera and the gun the camera's probably in in marvin's office you think it was there when we
2227120	2233040	were there and then did rosemary use our gun at the end there was it just uh oh yeah she she used
2233040	2239040	the uh glass gun with glass tubing on it well we can't can't really steal that before we wait till
2239040	2243600	it's after all the commotion is done and we just walk in there we need to get away from this
2243600	2248400	mausoleum in case some more of ourselves come out of there let's just go all we have to do
2248400	2253520	mechanically speaking is wait for several hours and then clark's mind is blown thinking about
2253520	2260320	another group of us coming out of that mausoleum after us i can't come right none of this is making
2260320	2264800	sense hey man maybe they'll have tilde crossed off maybe they'll have maggie crossed off then
2264800	2276320	we just gotta sit here till they're all done oh shit
2276560	2285440	you got him fucking all right hey we won the campaign you win you win this has been really
2285440	2292000	fun guys honestly 53 episodes pretty solid we wrapped up every loose end yeah
2294800	2300800	i mean i know you're joking clark but do you want to try it well i mean if we came back we
2300800	2305680	got to cross one of these off i agree i think one of these is meant for us i think it'll be
2305680	2309520	the first one we happen to well what do you want to wait around and try to get those things or
2309520	2313360	just think we should try to get the items if we could let's work and bring them back to contention
2313360	2316960	do you want to literally wait or do you think we should work on something else and then we're like
2316960	2321360	oh yeah we're probably finishing up at marvin's about now then go get those well look we never
2321360	2326960	you freaked out before you called maggie call maggie real quick oh yeah do you guys want me
2326960	2335440	to call maggie yeah guys remember don't try to summon clark again oh that was the other thing
2335440	2338960	yeah you failed but you still get the knowledge don't get something from that i thought that's
2338960	2343360	what you said yeah you absolutely do you'll tell me later or he's gonna make it doesn't
2343360	2348480	remember the question there was no question you just told me to roll it oh you were trying to
2349440	2354160	like think real hard about coming back to the mausoleum as old clark's to maybe and then i
2354160	2360080	started yelling clark thomas and look if you want to leave the room okay hey man no he can't push us
2360160	2372720	around we're gonna stay
2378080	2383600	so joe but because you crit failed that check on a natural you're gonna get hit with a big wave
2383600	2392000	a crit fail on a natural is a good thing as much as a bad thing i get it yeah so
2392000	2399360	basically how this works is when you freaked out this knowledge wasn't in your head at all
2399360	2404880	you literally just broke a part of your brain just snapped apart right but then when they bring it up
2404880	2413280	you start to piece together what you had seen and what you saw was a dark room surrounded by wood
2413280	2421120	and stone and beautiful ornate candlesticks curtains it's really lush and beautiful in
2421120	2429120	this room it's very clearly not this time period by candlelight you see huddled over a desk is a
2429120	2439040	figure wearing a black cloak scribbling furiously into a book the book itself is extremely ornate
2439040	2445200	seems to be made of some sort of leather that you don't recognize almost uncured and bleeding
2446640	2454160	and as the camera pans around you see lit by this candle is the face of a very old
2454160	2456560	very decrepit clark bishop
2460240	2465680	you hear a knock at the door and this giant wooden door opens up
2466480	2474080	lord my lord and then you're immediately taken to a car and it is flying down the highway and
2474080	2481280	behind the steering wheel is maggie cook it's a silver accord and she grabs her phone and starts
2481280	2487760	dialing furiously at it can i see what she's dialing she's dialing the number for clark bishop
2487760	2491840	my number the number that i know is mine the number that you know is yours and she looked
2492480	2498800	frantic she looked extremely frantic okay you had all those memories flash through but they were
2498800	2503920	more full last time but your mind couldn't even comprehend them enough these are the traces of
2503920	2508720	information that you could pull out that you're remembering now and as you're remembering it and
2508720	2516960	you're staring at them in this moment the phone in your pocket starts to buzz fucking dope oh my god
2516960	2528080	okay
2532240	2536480	went to whatever town he was from and got me a pin that i still have that says uh
2536480	2542080	i lost my heart to alfred packer
2542240	2547680	the the university where they went was in that town and they're like sardonically in the 60s
2547680	2555680	the students named the the meal hall like alfred packer that's great that's so good we need to have
2555680	2559600	more cannibalism on this show you know there's there was some early on i got a feeling it's
2559600	2567440	coming up oh yeah there was there was an awful awful one early on so as you guys are questioning
2567520	2572880	clark bishop about oh yeah yeah as you guys are questioning clark bishop about this information
2572880	2578320	you see him reach for his pocket reach for this and i just in once with motion it comes out of my
2578320	2583920	pocket to my ear maggie yeah yeah hey hey i'm on my way to the city cemetery right now i need to

2688000	2694240	past the old woman in the wheelchair good luck you make your way through these above ground tombs of
2694240	2700720	the city cemetery and head back into the parking lot and there you see that the only car in the
2700720	2707360	lot is clark bishop's silver honda accord on loan from the circle of knowledge i trailed behind a
2707360	2711440	little bit because i uh when they were out at earshot i told the old lady that she might as
2711440	2718080	well just stay here because how slow she's going she's gonna be back pretty soon and then i laugh
2718080	2723200	and then i run back to the parking lot that old lady rolls sanity she passed she's good
2724080	2729920	yeah you think you can fucking disturb her with shit like that she's like son i fucking know like

2748960	2753760	guess we'll find out do we happen to hear the whine of a motor open absolutely i think that
2753760	2757280	might be her fellas clark roll alertness for me
2759360	2769040	what's the wheel of fortune song i fail wheel of fortune are you going to be the one who wins
2769040	2778000	wheel of fortune a fortune can you be the one who crushes the wheel that's it tight all right so
2778560	2786240	you guys are standing around and a silver honda accord comes flying down it matches the one that's
2786240	2793520	sitting in front of you and driving is maggie cook john lee pettymore and keith vigna have not seen
2793520	2799120	her in the flesh but you've been told that she's alive so i'm not gonna have your old sanity but
2799120	2806400	she pulls up right next to you guys rolls down her window and she's got big ass sunglasses on
2806400	2813440	and she looks at clark clark we got a mission we got a this is okay so i sent out everybody else
2813440	2818800	and i you you three might be the only one who can handle this right now because if he sees me
2818800	2825280	he will lose his marbles but you know bruce robin and then she looks at keith vigna specifically and
2825280	2833520	keith you would know that bruce robin is ferguson's business partner okay and he is now the full owner
2833520	2841360	of bar corp do you get it bruce robin like batman and robin yes yeah yeah like a hundred percent

2860080	2870160	again right back to back but i think he might need to be taken out physically with death do you think
2870160	2877360	round trip that could take us less than three or four hours absolutely i mean he i would imagine
2877360	2882240	he's at one of the businesses right now which can't be more than an hour away so well hey we
2882240	2886560	we were looking for something to do to kill the time before we get those things maggie is this
