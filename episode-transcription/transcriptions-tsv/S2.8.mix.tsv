0	1840	Greetings.
1840	3600	Introduction.
3600	5760	Transition.
5760	9320	694.2 PTBP.
9320	10920	The good numbers.
10920	14160	The radio station is... somewhere.
14160	16840	Wolf the dog is... here.
16840	19320	There is nothing to fear.
19320	20440	Maybe.
20440	21920	We have fans.
21920	24760	They shouted us from the void.
24760	28520	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Bundad Elliot,
28560	32400	who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.
32400	34280	Which you should also do.
34280	36760	Bundad Elliot writes,
36760	39000	Wolf, I need your help.
39000	42720	You travel through myriad realms and unknown plains
42720	45920	and maybe you know how I might escape.
45920	48880	The bunnies that were once my pets
48880	52120	now hold me within a liminal space.
52120	55960	Doors folding in upon themselves.
55960	59080	The eldritch forms of these furry fiends
59080	61200	have been revealed to me.
61200	63640	They keep me fed and clothed,
63640	66520	but I am captive nonetheless.
66520	70200	All because I wouldn't give them banana chips.
70200	74240	I have slipped this message through a crack in the wall.
74240	76120	I hope you find it.
76120	79480	P.S. Please send banana chips.
80720	83520	Oh damn, you met those guys?
83520	87480	Tell those fun buns ol' Wolfie says hello.
87480	89560	Enjoy your stay.
89560	93520	I'm sure they won't be keeping you there for too long.
93520	97720	Humans live what, a couple hundred years or so?
97720	100400	Ah, you'll be fine.
100400	103400	I will not be sending you banana chips
103400	106320	because I do not believe in them.
106320	111080	I will not conform and I shall not obey.
111080	113360	If you wanna write up something for your wolf
114120	117880	tag at pretending pod on Instagram fuck Mark Zuckerberg
117880	121240	at pretending pod on Twitter fuck Jack Dorsey
121240	125240	fuck Elon Musk or pretending to be people on Facebook.
125240	127800	Another fuck Mark Zuckerberg.
127800	130320	And if you wanna be the very best,
130320	133120	like no one ever was,
133120	135680	go ahead and write up a five star review
135680	138240	on the podcast app of your choice
138240	140080	and let us know.
140080	142400	We love that shit.
142400	147120	But if you're keeping your love of 694.2 PTBP
147120	151640	a dirty little secret from your online friends and family,
151640	155200	you don't wanna post about how much you love this show.
155200	160200	You don't wanna wear our six shirts, hats, and fanny packs.
161200	165000	You don't wanna dry off with a towel from Splashylvania.
165000	166880	Well, that's all fine.
166880	170240	You can confidentially support us
170240	174480	at patreon.com slash pretending pod
174480	177880	and for even $5 per month,
177880	182240	you'll get access to 33 bonus episodes.
182240	183080	And what's that?
183080	186560	I'm hearing there is more on the way.
186560	188760	What more can I say?
188760	192840	The links are in the show notes.
192840	195840	All right, I got through what I needed to.
195840	200320	And now it's time for me to read the news.
200320	205320	Last time Beck Wilder was impaled by a DIY Jackalope
206000	209920	with a yellow ribbon tying the mundane antlers
209920	214920	to the standard rabbit to create the mythological beast.
215480	219080	While watching Stevie witness Fox God'll twitch
219080	222440	and convulse at the side of headphones,
222480	227280	Cal realized that she was very likely Faith Godell,
227280	229880	the oldest child of Fred Godell
229880	232960	disguised as the production assistant.
232960	235600	The medical staff at Grover's Gorge
235600	238040	showed up in a bullpen car
238040	241000	to pick up the Gord camera operator.
241000	243000	And on the way to the lab,
243000	246280	the group saw another makeshift Jackalope.
246280	249920	This one with a purple ribbon, Fox Godell,
249960	253640	who Stevie says went by Greg before,
253640	257520	quickly grabbed the ribbon, popped it in his pocket
257520	262240	and promptly fucked off back to his Godell innovation zone
262240	266640	or jizz, if you'd like, and I do.
266640	269720	In the lab, the medical staff says
269720	272520	they can treat Beck's wound here in the same room
272520	274640	as the interview with the mayor.
274640	279240	The mayor, an old beat up damp box turtle
279280	281200	called Sandro.
281200	286200	Taking us now to this quirky and riveting news story.
286600	291600	It's Altagirl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.
291600	296600	My life is great and it's all my fault
296960	301960	Cause my life is great and it's all mine
311400	316400	Cause my life is great and it's all my fault
321600	326600	On the tree subreddit right now it was like,
330400	332560	I joined thinking this was actually about trees.
332560	333880	Where's the real tree sub?
333880	335480	And I knew that the one about trees
335480	338040	is called marijuana enthusiasts,
338040	340920	but I didn't, there's some other ones that I didn't know.
340920	344400	World politics is anime titties
344400	347240	and anime titties is world politics.
348240	351080	And John Cena is about potato salad
351080	352840	and potato salad is about John Cena.
352840	355040	Oh my God, nice.
355040	358640	Oh, also I knew this one, but Super Bowl
358640	360440	is actually about superb owls.
363920	365320	So I didn't know this one.
365320	367040	There's an Amish subreddit.
367040	371560	It has 175,000 members and no posts.
371560	376560	I fell on a jackalope.
377920	379760	Oh, good call dude.
382040	382880	Holy shit.
384840	386240	Whoa, look out.
386240	387880	Fell on a jackalope.
390000	392600	Damn, I remember watching those videos for the first time
392600	394760	when I was like probably in the sixth grade.
394760	396360	I have no idea what you're referencing.
396360	398640	Guy on a buffalo.
398640	399480	Whoa, look out.
399480	400320	I still have no idea what you're referencing.
400320	401960	I haven't seen Guy on a Buffalo.
401960	404160	I guess I haven't seen Guy on a Buffalo.
404160	406960	Is it one of those like two girls, one cups kind of videos?
406960	408160	Cause I haven't seen any of those.
408160	409320	The guy fucks a buffalo.
409320	410160	Yeah.
410160	411720	Like donkey man.
411720	412640	Donkey man.
413520	414720	We've already done this.
414720	416000	Mr. Hands.
416000	416840	Donkey man.
419640	421560	Let's not do this.
421560	422400	Okay.
422400	423240	Thanks.
423240	424560	We'll do it afterwards though, for sure.
424560	425400	No, we'll forget.
425400	428440	So yeah, we're talking to a turtle.
428480	429720	We were, yeah.
431520	432760	So what are we doing?
432760	433600	So we're talking to a turtle?
433600	434440	So we're talking to the turtle.
434440	436720	Can news get a big old scoop with the mayor of this town?
436720	438080	Turns out, turtle.
439720	441000	Sandro.
441000	441840	Sandro.
441840	443960	Sandro the turtle.
443960	444880	Sandro.
444880	445800	Sandro.
445800	450800	I put a microphone on the turtle's shell and...
453000	454360	Cal, pat your back and he's like,
454360	456280	way to step up for a back buddy.
456280	460760	Mr. Mayor, could you spell your first and last name?
460760	462920	The makeup artist is kind of like laughing
462920	466760	and she looks up and is like, you got him?
466760	469080	And then she kind of walks away and heads out the door.
469080	470440	Says you got him to us?
470440	472880	To Julius, who's standing there.
472880	475560	Cal leans into Stevie again.
475560	479000	So does turtle, can it talk?
480720	484120	Exhales real big, looks you dead in the eyes.
484120	485640	Kinda.
485640	487320	What do you mean kinda?
487320	490040	Beck did not expect the word kinda.
490040	492400	It's a whole thing, okay.
492400	494640	Like two taps for yes, one for no.
494640	496880	And one of the medical people kinda,
496880	498920	we're gonna be right back with the equipment that we need
498920	500040	to take care of this.
500040	501280	Should only take a couple minutes.
501280	502920	And they head out to the front door.
502920	504640	Word, no hurry.
504640	506200	And as they head out the door,
506200	509280	you see a 58 year old man standing there.
509280	513760	He's got bright blue eyes and a face lined by the sun,
513760	518160	which is topped by a flat top of salt and pepper hair.
518160	520200	He's Uncle Strong.
520200	522520	Like he could bench 250 pounds,
522520	523360	but he gets winded.
523360	524200	Oh, that's not his name.
524200	525040	I thought.
525040	527280	He's Uncle Strong.
527280	530120	I was like, okay, is he a turtle's uncle?
530120	532680	He just looks like he could bench 250 pounds,
532680	534600	but he also looks like he gets winded
534600	537400	going up a flight of stairs.
537400	538920	This is Chuck Bidwell.
538920	540520	He says, as he introduces himself.
540520	541960	Hey, how's it going there?
541960	543080	It's Chuck Bidwell.
543240	545320	It's nice to meet each and every one of you.
545320	546160	I'm the mayor.
546160	547000	Well, I'm not the mayor.
547000	547840	I'm kind of the mayor.
547840	552840	Shout out to Anthony from Bristol, UK for Chuck Bidwell.
552840	556680	Anthony is one of our $10 or up subscribers on Patreon.
556680	557520	Thanks, Anthony.
557520	558360	Or up.
558360	559200	Or up.
561040	562840	Yeah, Chuck Bidwell.
562840	565040	It's a pleasure to meet each and every one of you.
565040	568240	Oh, it looks like you've had a bit of a rough and tumble
568240	570360	goal of it so far, Mr. Camerman, sir.
570360	571640	Fell on a jackalope.
571640	574360	As he looks at you, guess what happens?
574360	576440	Oh, wait, wait, wait, Zach, Zach.
576440	577440	I think I can guess.
580440	583360	He's wearing a green dry fit polo
583360	586640	tucked in kind of over his belly.
587760	588600	Hog?
589600	590720	Yes.
590720	594960	And he kind of zones out for a moment
594960	599960	and you see into Chuck Bidwell's deepest, saddest soul
600960	605640	of a face and then with just a half a second,
605640	606920	he's right back to normal.
606920	607760	Hey, how's it going?
607760	609040	Chuck Bidwell, yeah.
609040	609880	What's your name?
609880	610720	What's your name?
610720	612120	Julius Summers.
612120	613480	Julius, Mr. Summers.
613480	614320	Nice to meet you.
614320	615160	And you, sir?
615160	617200	Hey, Beck, it's Beck Wilder.
617200	619120	Beck Wilder, what happened to you, son?
619120	622560	I fell on a jackalope.
622560	626920	I fell on a jackalope and I don't think I survived.
626920	629240	Oh, oh, he pats you on the shoulder
629480	631680	and he's like, he looks at the other two.
631680	632840	Did he kill it?
632840	634960	No, no, I'm sure it's fine.
634960	636240	And what is your name, sir?
636240	637240	Chuck Bidwell here.
637240	639560	Cal Colorado, City Action News.
639560	641080	Pleased to meet you, Mr. Bidwell.
641080	643160	Oh, right, you're the Cal Colorado
643160	645640	who has come to do all the wonderful interviews
645640	648200	and show off Grover's Gorge for the beautiful town
648200	649520	that it is, that's right, okay.
649520	652480	Well, we've got you set up over here, of course.
652480	655680	You know, with the mayor, Sandro, if you met Sandro,
655680	659160	I'm not the mayor, I happened to lose.
660040	661320	I lost the election there.
661320	666320	Oh, so Sandro was able to participate in an election?
666800	671160	Well, yeah, but he does get elected every time.
671160	672960	How long has he been the mayor?
672960	676000	He's been the mayor since almost the beginning, yeah,
676000	678360	since the founding of Grover's Gorge.
678360	679920	And he'll always be the mayor?
679920	682600	Well, seemingly, seemingly for sure.
682600	685240	I mean, I lost by 836 votes.
685240	686600	What is the voting age here?
686600	688400	Voting age is 18, like everyone else.
688400	689600	We're in America, aren't we?
689600	691840	Well, that's an interesting question.
691840	693360	You were the mayor, perhaps?
693360	695880	Well, I'm not the mayor, I wish I was the mayor.
695880	697520	I mean, the only two votes I even got
697520	700000	were from me and my wife, Barbara,
700000	702280	kind of honestly, if I'm being completely honest,
702280	704200	she pushed me into running.
704200	705960	I'm being totally straight with you.
707160	708520	Yes, you're not the mayor in title,
708520	711200	and yet you have all the responsibilities of the mayor.
711200	712040	Is that correct?
712040	714000	Yeah, speaking of those responsibilities,
714000	716600	them responsibilities is why I was so late.
716640	719280	I'm so sorry that I didn't greet you at the gate.
719280	722360	That is my deepest and searest apologies.
722360	723440	I'm so sorry.
723440	727280	Isn't it funny that a turtle is running for mayor?
729360	731680	Oh, I like this kid, you don't have him on camera yet.
731680	734720	Oh, you writing the jokes for this old man over here?
734720	737400	That is very funny, I'm going to say that.
739400	741000	It's all yours, Cal.
742600	744800	The turtle is a turtle.
744800	745640	Right.
745640	747400	At this point, you've walked away from the turtle.
747400	749240	No, I think we're standing right by it.
749240	751640	I've got my eye on it, it's not really going anywhere.
751640	752960	Okay, we're all kind of bunched up
752960	755120	in the same area then right up the front.
755120	757560	The medical staff comes in and starts treating Beck
757560	759800	while you guys are having this conversation.
759800	762200	Hey there, whoa, precious cargo now.
762200	764080	They have some sort of machinery
764080	766640	that you haven't seen in a hospital before,
766640	771040	and they begin attaching it to Beck's backside
771040	771960	and upper thigh.
771960	774560	I instinctively say, Beck, get a shot of that.
774560	775600	But then I realized.
777520	778920	But Beck is trying to,
778920	780400	whatever weird positions they put him in,
780400	781480	he's holding the camera,
781480	783200	trying to get footage of this new machine.
783200	784320	You still have the camera?
784320	785160	Yeah.
786840	790560	When he does that, Julius, yeah, grabs the camera,
790560	792240	trying to still keep the shot.
792240	793340	You feel some resistance.
793340	795840	Everybody roll alertness for me real quick.
799600	802200	I'm going to burn my dice, if that's cool with you.
803200	804840	I got a 27, I pass.
804840	806280	And you're at a negative 20, Cal.
806280	808600	Yeah, doesn't matter, 73 fail.
808600	810200	Got an 87 fail.
810200	811920	Julius, as you've walked away,
811920	814760	you actually notice that similarly to the way
814760	818400	that the glass kind of rose from the grass below
818400	820640	on the first floor, letting you through the entrance
820640	825000	into this building, the glass on this room, the window,
825000	827000	opens in a similar fashion.
827000	829440	Chuck sees that you notice and you look down
829440	832120	and see that he's got a little clicker in his hand.
832120	833480	Oh, I thought it'd be nice that way
833480	834920	there's no glass behind the shot.
834920	837560	We get a beautiful, perfect view
837560	839140	of the city park right behind.
839140	840360	Oh, like a remote.
840360	841680	I thought you meant like he's clicking
841680	844320	to see how many times I noticed things.
846320	848160	I'm like, what the fuck, man?
848160	850440	I was like, I'm taking that away from him.
850440	851280	You're like, what's the count?
851280	852780	I see.
852780	855440	Chuck, that's, thank you, incredible.
855440	857920	I wouldn't have even thought to ask.
857920	858760	Yeah.
858760	860280	Can you do it to, I mean, you don't need to,
860320	862840	but can you do that to all the windows in this building?
862840	864360	Yeah, isn't that amazing?
864360	867840	It's an absolutely incredible laboratory that we have here.
867840	868680	It's beautiful.
868680	870640	And that controls all the doors as well.
870640	872480	Yeah, I mean, the door is the window,
872480	874280	the window is the door, am I right?
875160	876680	You'll see here, and he points behind him
876680	878680	that there aren't really any doors inside here.
878680	880960	There's just kind of open doorways.
880960	883440	Julius is going to bookmark that information
883440	886520	and definitely gonna try to steal that at some point.
886520	888480	How's the machine, what's it doing to me now?
888480	891620	They've got a machine that kind of wraps around.
891620	894980	It's almost like a heating pad, but on the inside of it,
894980	897340	there is some sort of technology
897340	898740	that you haven't seen before.
898740	901320	It kind of looks like a light almost,
901320	905080	but they can fold this piece of machinery around you.
905080	908640	It's easily foldable around the back of your leg.
908640	913320	And when it's on, you just kind of feel this sort of heat,
913320	916480	a nice vibration, you get hard.
919400	921960	You guys gotta try this.
921960	923800	Beckworth, you're at work.
923800	926400	Do you remember those old school machine things
926400	928520	that would do this for weight loss?
928520	931560	Oh yeah, just kind of like pulsate your muscles.
931560	932400	It was a band around.
932400	934380	No, it was like a band that just went like,
934380	935220	okay, it's wrapped around you.
935220	936800	Like just putting his hand at the side
936800	938480	and then waving them wildly.
939760	941880	I know, in my mind, this makes sense.
942880	943720	Anyway.
943720	946040	I'm kind of talking to a medic person near me.
946040	948280	I've never seen this before.
949040	954040	Is this like some like new medical issue thing?
955040	959600	You tell me and they pull it off and you look behind you
959600	964040	and you basically don't have wounds anymore.
965560	966760	Beck is making wide,
966760	968800	like he's looking at where the wounds were
968800	971320	and then looking at Cal and then looking at Julius
971320	973640	and then looking down at the leg that is now healed.
973640	977420	Yeah, and you feel like there's some slight cuts, right?
977860	981300	Where the holes were not even sutured back together,
981300	982580	but where they came back together,
982580	984220	they're not completely healed.
984220	986500	One of them goes, oh, it didn't actually,
986500	988380	didn't work all the way, but that's okay.
988380	989920	It should heal up naturally from here
989920	990960	and you should be able to walk
990960	993680	and they kind of hold your hand and lift you up out
993680	995620	and you do, you feel much better
995620	997180	as you gain back two hit points.
997180	999320	You're only one away from full health
999320	1001700	and you can walk on this leg pretty easily now.
1001700	1006060	Doctors, is that gaudal technology?
1006060	1008540	So with everyone paying attention
1008540	1011380	to the gaudal technology here.
1011380	1012980	Yeah, the turtle's dead or something, right?
1012980	1013860	Yeah, for sure.
1013860	1016680	They help Beck up out of the bed.
1016680	1017520	Oh no.
1023260	1025780	Well, it's okay, they can just put him in the thing.
1025780	1029860	Go ahead and roll alertness at a negative 40.
1029860	1031860	The turtle's gonna fall out the window.
1032700	1036580	Yeah, I've failed miserably.
1036580	1038420	I mean, I have 40 alertness, so I'd-
1038420	1039780	Oh yeah, ouchy, ouchy.
1039780	1041700	Cal is still looking at his in astonishment
1041700	1042540	at the healed wounds.
1042540	1045340	The camera looks behind this group
1045340	1048300	staring at this incredible technology
1048300	1053300	as this turtle is swaying back and forth on its stool.
1053980	1055260	I just wanna say right now,
1055260	1057940	we did not put that turtle on that fucking stool.
1057940	1061380	This is a gaudal company mistake.
1063140	1068140	Teeter, totter, teeter, whoop, teeter totter turtle die.
1074820	1079320	Chuck Bidwell looks up and goes, oh my God.
1079320	1082300	And you see the turtle going over the side
1082300	1086420	along with the stool, boom, off the side of this building.
1086540	1088380	The open window door thing.
1088380	1089580	Oh, fuck.
1089580	1091640	None of this is on us.
1091640	1093200	From the quick glimpse we got,
1093200	1096220	did it look like the turtle was doing that on purpose?
1096220	1099020	Because you weren't able to get a quick glimpse,
1099020	1102100	you're completely unable to roll.
1102100	1105340	Human, animal, turtle-ant?
1105340	1106180	Turd-ant.
1106180	1107800	Turd-ant.
1107800	1110900	Yeah, we just hear the cries of the onlookers.
1110900	1114860	Literally, suddenly you hear a squoosh.
1116540	1119620	From your second tier in the lab.
1119620	1122380	And then you just hear this, oh my God.
1122380	1124800	Oh no, holy shit, oh my God.
1126800	1128300	Sandro, no, Sandro.
1130300	1132220	Sandro, where's Sandro?
1134460	1136380	Our town is leaderless.
1140260	1142900	Why do animals keep dying around me?
1142900	1143980	Everyone roll.
1144300	1147100	Beck, you were much farther away from this turtle.
1150460	1152980	I'm not even joking, I'm not using these dice anymore.
1152980	1153800	That's an 88.
1153800	1154640	Again.
1154640	1157300	Oh my God, dude.
1157300	1158660	Have you rolled an 88 or did?
1158660	1160740	Yeah, I rolled an 88 earlier.
1160740	1162900	I don't think I've rolled under a 70 something all night.
1162900	1164300	Wow, that would be great
1164300	1166820	if we were playing some different game.
1166820	1167860	I got a 21.
1170060	1172840	Beck, you know what, it's a critical fail,
1172880	1176280	so you're gonna lose four grip, the full D4.
1176280	1177120	Oof-da.
1177120	1179440	What are you at and what's your breaking point?
1179440	1182840	I'm at 68 with a breaking point of 60.
1182840	1186400	Luckily, grip was what Beck was good at, so.
1186400	1187240	Nice.
1187240	1188360	He's taking a lot of hits though.
1188360	1189200	Yeah.
1189200	1192660	This is not a normal day for him.
1192660	1195640	You've said that a couple times now, I think.
1195640	1197480	This is not a normal day.
1199240	1200240	I don't know if it's a human roller
1200240	1201400	just looking at their faces,
1201400	1204640	but Howard's like, I assume Chuck has his own reasons
1204640	1206160	for whatever his reaction is,
1206160	1208340	but just a normal medical staff,
1208340	1212680	seeing the mayor throw themselves off the thing.
1212680	1214480	Why are you entertaining this?
1214480	1219480	They placed a turtle on a stool
1220020	1221920	in front of an open fucking window.
1223680	1225160	But I mean, are they like in tears
1225160	1226840	like their great leader has died
1226840	1228760	or are they just like, oh shit.
1228760	1231640	No, they're mostly super, super confused
1231640	1236320	and they are at a loss for what to do now.
1237680	1239540	I need you all to roll grip.
1239540	1240380	Failed.
1240380	1241200	Pass.
1241200	1243200	This might be why you said to do this,
1243200	1246920	but Julius for sure was still had that clicker in mind
1246920	1248960	and was like, oh fuck, he did this.
1250620	1251880	Interesting.
1251880	1252720	Joe.
1252720	1255040	97 baby with brand new dice, sir.
1255040	1256760	Joe's rolling bad tonight.
1259040	1261840	Thomas, go ahead and remove your headphones real quick.
1265360	1270360	I need you both to roll a D8 and add one.
1274640	1276440	An eight plus one is nine.
1276440	1278640	Holy shit, dude.
1279480	1281160	That's a four, so a five.
1281160	1282400	So you're gonna lose five.
1282400	1283620	Holy shit.
1283620	1284520	Beck wild there.
1284520	1287740	Julius Summers, you lose nine grip.
1287740	1289740	And that puts me past my breaking point.
1289740	1294740	As you both see a wet energy erupt from the spot
1295260	1299040	where the turtle just teeter tottered to its doom
1299040	1303160	and this wet energy flings itself
1303160	1305780	into the body of Chuck Bidwell,
1305780	1309520	throwing him back through the wall
1309520	1311720	on the far side of this room.
1311720	1315300	And it is a glass wall and it shatters.
1315300	1316880	Holy shit.
1317820	1319180	Holy shit, Zach.
1321660	1322520	Now, if you don't mind,
1322520	1326500	if I could talk to you each one at a time, Luke first.
1326500	1331500	This wet energy that you see just for a glimpse,
1331500	1335660	you just catch enough of it to get some semblance
1335660	1339760	of like what it looks like, what it moves like,
1339760	1341320	how it reacts to things around it.
1341320	1345520	Like very short split second as this thing flies past you.
1345560	1350560	So I'm gonna let you ask three yes or no questions
1351040	1354740	to kind of try to decipher what this thing is like.
1354740	1356720	Okay, everything has a shape,
1356720	1361440	but did it have like a, not like human shape,
1361440	1364680	but like what, there's a word I'm looking for here.
1364680	1365520	Humanoid?
1365520	1366840	Humanoid, sure.
1366840	1369520	Yes, it has a humanoid shape.
1370880	1372280	Did it make a sound?
1372280	1373920	Yes.
1373920	1375680	Question two, part A.
1375680	1378280	Like a buzzing sound or like what?
1378280	1379340	It was weird.
1379340	1384340	It's like you could hear a man's voice,
1385600	1386440	but it was not.
1386440	1388440	But like not actual words or anything?
1388440	1393440	Er-yem-hoth-floo-hah-maw-hah-maw.
1395440	1400440	Er-yem-hoth-floo-hah-maw-hah-maw.
1400440	1405440	Er-yem-hoth-floo-hah-maw-hah-maw.
1409220	1412320	But it's just like whispering through,
1412320	1414720	almost like it's this enormous noise
1414720	1416960	that's billowing from out of this thing,
1416960	1419640	but almost distant with inside of it.
1419640	1420480	Gotcha.
1422440	1423280	Whoa.
1424280	1425560	Okay, third question.
1425560	1426720	Maybe you only get two.
1427600	1429880	What did it taste like?
1430200	1431400	We got away from yes, no questions,
1431400	1433000	and that's fine, because this is more fun.
1433000	1434440	And as it kind of went by you,
1434440	1439200	you get this like just saltiness in your nose
1439200	1441640	and on your tongue, like as it whips by you.
1442840	1443800	Okay.
1443800	1444840	Very scary.
1444840	1446340	Hey, thanks.
1446340	1447380	I rubbed my ear so much,
1447380	1449160	I think I gave myself dizziness.
1449160	1450660	I was kind of sick.
1450660	1451680	I'm sorry.
1451680	1453560	Let's make you sicker.
1453560	1457080	This wet energy, you kind of get a glimpse of it
1457080	1459680	as it just flies past you.
1460320	1463000	To the body of Chuck Bidwell, throwing him back.
1463000	1465400	So I'm going to let you ask three questions.
1465400	1468980	And I think the first two have to be yes or no questions.
1468980	1471620	And then the last one doesn't have to be a yes or no question
1471620	1473960	based on what I did with Luke,
1473960	1477360	in order to get an idea of like what it looks like,
1477360	1479800	what it seems like, what it's doing, like how it moves,
1479800	1481040	like anything you want to ask
1481040	1483760	about what you might be able to perceive.
1483760	1484680	Okay.
1484680	1487880	My first question is, you said wet.
1487880	1490880	Did it splash against Chuck Bidwell
1490880	1492920	or did it get absorbed by Chuck Bidwell?
1494200	1496000	Yes to the second one.
1496000	1497360	Okay. That's what I hoped.
1499760	1501800	Is there a reason that I saw it?
1501800	1502640	No, wait.
1502640	1503640	Yes or no questions. Sorry.
1503640	1504640	Is there a reason?
1504640	1506120	Is a yes or no?
1509080	1510540	Doesn't help me though.
1510540	1512540	I did elaborate when Luke asked his second
1512540	1514400	yes or no question, so we can do this.
1514400	1516920	Well, I just wanted to clarify,
1516960	1518600	was it just because I happened to be looking
1518600	1520000	in the right direction?
1520000	1524600	Or did it seem, I don't know how to ask this.
1524600	1526200	Yeah, no, it's a good question.
1526200	1527100	You think that like,
1527100	1529360	no matter what was going through your head,
1529360	1531720	because you were looking in the right direction,
1531720	1533040	you fucking saw this thing.
1533040	1534400	Because I was looking in the right direction,
1534400	1535980	I saw this thing. Okay.
1535980	1539960	For my third question then, you've said wet energy.
1539960	1541400	How fast was it?
1541400	1543520	Fucking wildly fast.
1543520	1544780	Like lightning strike fast
1544780	1548380	or like somebody's shooting a super soaker out of the air.
1548380	1550020	Super soaker. Okay.
1550020	1550860	Good question.
1554860	1556780	Tommy, Tommy come play.
1557940	1559500	We're bringing Thomas back with the bird here.
1559500	1561740	Oh wow, what the fuck?
1561740	1565860	Thomas, that reaction comes from seeing all of a sudden,
1565860	1570420	Chuck Bidwell has exploded through the far side wall
1570420	1573780	on the opposite side from the open wall.
1573780	1577580	He slams backward through glass, exploding everywhere,
1577580	1580380	10 meters from where he just stood a second ago
1580380	1581720	when you saw him.
1581720	1585060	You lose one grip as you have no idea how the fuck
1585060	1585900	that just happened.
1585900	1589140	No, it's pretty obviously that the ghost of the turtle
1589140	1591340	that Charles Bidwell tried to assassinate
1592260	1594180	or successfully assassinated,
1594180	1597340	came back and like super scienced his ass through the window
1597340	1599680	into like a last act of spiritual vengeance.
1599680	1601340	You said explodes through the glass,
1601340	1603500	but his body didn't explode, did it?
1604060	1604900	No, his body did not explode.
1604900	1605740	It's the glass around him that exploded.
1605740	1607060	The glass around him explodes, yeah.
1607060	1612060	And you hear him just like, oh, fucking shit.
1612220	1614200	Oh my God.
1616640	1621640	You hear the blabered breathing of Chuck Bidwell.
1622260	1624300	Oh, oh my God.
1626260	1630660	And then you hear nothing coming from the room
1630660	1632820	that is now part of your room.
1633740	1637460	Partition gone, glass wall down,
1637460	1640420	shattered into a million little pieces.
1641620	1645700	The footage from Beck's camera maybe had seen the,
1645700	1648180	it's shown like an empty stool tipped over
1648180	1651540	and nothingness just, you know, there, there.
1651540	1654580	And then you heard a big crash off camera
1654580	1657940	and Beck was so shocked that he is now pointed
1657940	1659700	to the ground with the camera.
1659700	1660540	Yeah, that's perfect.
1660540	1663340	And then after the thing had settled,
1664060	1667580	yeah, so it goes from like your wound healed
1667580	1670420	to an empty stool across the room
1670420	1673980	to just like chaos having already erupted.
1673980	1674820	Yeah, exactly.
1674820	1675940	Okay, very cool.
1675940	1676760	Luke.
1676760	1677600	Yeah.
1677600	1678440	Let's talk.
1678440	1680980	How, what are we doing with breaking points this season?
1680980	1682060	What do you guys want to do?
1682060	1685700	Do we want to come up with like a phobia or mania together?
1685700	1687360	Do we want to do it just one-on-one
1687360	1689860	or do we want to roll on the table like we did last time?
1689860	1691260	I would do any of the above.
1691260	1692700	I don't think we should do it together
1692700	1696860	just cause it's fun to have that as a secret or not,
1696860	1698340	you know, rolling is fun,
1698340	1701580	but I think it makes more sense to have something related
1701580	1703580	to what happened to make you break.
1703580	1705360	Here's a pitch that's half your idea
1705360	1707140	and half the opposite of your idea.
1707140	1709420	Joe and I come up with your mania related to,
1711460	1712860	related to your current situation.
1712860	1713700	That's interesting.
1713700	1714540	I don't hate it.
1714540	1715360	That's kind of fun.
1715360	1716200	And you know, vice versa all the way around.
1716200	1717040	Yeah, I like that.
1717040	1717880	Okay.
1717880	1718700	All right, cool.
1718700	1719540	I'm in.
1719540	1720820	Okay, so let's talk about it.
1721700	1722820	Well, he's never going to see a turtle
1722820	1723740	without shit in his pants.
1723740	1724580	I'll tell you that.
1724580	1727460	I was going to say, I'll listen, but I'll just not talk.
1727460	1729460	Hang on though, the bad thing about this is that
1729460	1732260	Thomas and his character don't know
1732260	1735380	what it actually was that made him lose his career.
1735380	1736420	It doesn't really work.
1736420	1737260	Yeah, okay.
1737260	1738080	That's fair.
1738080	1738920	I have no fucking clue.
1738920	1740260	Okay, Joe and Thomas,
1740260	1742100	take off your headphones real quick, please.
1742100	1743620	Do you have any ideas right off the top of your head?
1743620	1746200	So initially I was like, well, it's boring,
1746200	1747580	but like afraid of heights.
1747580	1749340	But the thing that fucked me up
1749340	1751380	wasn't the turtle falling out the window.
1751380	1755180	It was the fucking wet ghost energy thing.
1755180	1756480	Yeah, it was the wet energy.
1756480	1757980	So...
1757980	1759900	I would say let's go water.
1759900	1761140	Just hydrophobia?
1761140	1761980	Yeah, let's go.
1761980	1762820	Oh fuck, okay.
1762820	1764900	But let's say it's a specific kind where you can...
1764900	1769380	Like running water or like a stream or a faucet or a shower.
1769380	1772060	But still water is fine.
1772060	1773100	I'm not going to die.
1773100	1775160	And obviously we're not going to tell them
1775160	1776060	until it comes up.
1776060	1776880	Exactly.
1776880	1777720	Rock and roll.
1777720	1778940	Rock and roll.
1779420	1780620	Hell yeah, dude.
1780620	1781760	Welcome back, boys.
1781760	1782600	Hey.
1782600	1784220	I'm afraid of having a huge penis.
1784220	1785780	And so I start screaming.
1787220	1788060	Yeah, man.
1790220	1794120	And I look back and I remember that he has a huge penis
1794120	1795720	and it scares the shit out of me.
1796700	1799220	And I haven't seen cows yet, but I imagine it's big too.
1799220	1801300	We cannot get you around those statues.
1803540	1806660	Yeah, so Julius kind of, he comes to and...
1806660	1808860	I mean, you're in Fight, Flight or Freezer at this point.
1809820	1810900	Freeze.
1810900	1814260	Well, I'm going to go freeze.
1814260	1815740	Freeze will be four, five, six.
1815740	1817380	Fight, flight.
1817380	1820060	Okay, flight is one, fight is two or three.
1820060	1821460	Go ahead and roll a D six.
1822780	1824020	That's a three.
1824020	1826820	So you're going to fight.
1828100	1828940	Fight, yeah.
1828940	1829840	Fight.
1829840	1831980	Well, no, yeah, fight.
1831980	1834100	Fight is going to be your response here.
1834100	1838060	So I'm going to just...
1838860	1841180	Fucking attack a doctor.
1841180	1842020	Yep.
1842020	1843340	Go ahead and roll.
1843340	1846260	Are you using your hands or are you going to grab something
1846260	1848840	and utilize a weapon of some sort?
1848840	1851060	There's broken glass everywhere.
1851060	1853560	It's too far away from you to grab.
1853560	1855900	Yeah, it's 10 meters across the room.
1855900	1856900	What's close to me?
1856900	1858780	There's a whole like medical bay.
1858780	1860140	It just doesn't slide across grass floors
1860140	1861100	like it might on something.
1861100	1862380	Oh yeah.
1862380	1863420	Exactly.
1863420	1866220	There's a whole medical cart like right in front of you.
1866220	1869580	Yeah, I'm going to grab the blood pressure monitor.
1870500	1871640	Just start swinging.
1871640	1872840	Okay, awesome.
1872840	1875020	Go ahead and roll a melee weapons.
1875020	1876540	He's got a 90 in that.
1878540	1879460	I don't mind.
1879460	1881660	I got a 59 on a 50.
1881660	1884220	Oh shit, it's a higher skill than I would have guessed.
1884220	1885060	I'm athletic.
1885060	1889460	You fling your arms wildly at this medical professional
1889460	1892300	who just helped your friend and they're backing up
1892300	1895660	and they are really, really confused.
1896660	1898140	And they see the crazed look in your eye.
1898140	1899140	Okay, we're leaving.
1899140	1901500	And they grabbed the medical cart
1901500	1903860	and kind of wheel it backwards away from you.
1903860	1905020	Julius is screaming,
1905020	1908420	you fucking magicked my friend back and then the turtle,
1908420	1910860	you got the turtle energy.
1913020	1916980	The two look at each other and they look back at you
1916980	1921040	and then they look at each other and then they dip.
1921040	1922420	Probably the best solution.
1922420	1924700	Beck is looking at Julius and hearing him saying that
1924740	1929380	and he's nodding vigorously to whoever is in the room still.
1929380	1931500	It is literally just the three of you
1931500	1934340	and the body of Chuck in the other room at this point.
1934340	1937860	So Cal this whole time has been like watching everything.
1937860	1940140	He was furiously taking notes while
1942340	1945460	Julius was fighting with the doctors.
1945460	1948500	And as soon as he senses that like the audio is right,
1948500	1951220	he motions to Beck to roll and he says,
1951220	1953120	tonight, you're a little yeeted.
1954700	1959060	Turtle mayor of Godel Gulag assassinated
1959060	1960180	and the chief suspect,
1960180	1962980	his political rival is an unknown condition.
1962980	1965120	Tune in to Can Action News for more.
1966120	1969020	Stevie is standing there with eyes,
1969020	1973440	absolutely as wide as eyes can be.
1978120	1983120	Yeah, I didn't think this would happen.
1985180	1986260	Did you get that?
1986260	1988780	And then Beck is pulling down the camera
1988780	1990820	and is looking at the viewfinder
1990820	1993940	and realizes he didn't really get much
1993940	1996580	and his face kind of slacks.
1996580	1998140	Fuck.
1998140	1999660	There's no proof.
1999660	2001300	Oh shit.
2001300	2003300	How's Julius feeling at this point?
2003300	2005300	I would say absolutely enraged
2005300	2007540	and about to like punch Beck.
2007540	2009380	You like wanna break glass.
2009380	2013260	Julius stomps over to Chuck's body and is yelling,
2013300	2015780	Sandro, Sandro.
2015780	2019100	Cal kind of like cautiously walks up behind you
2019100	2021680	and he puts out an arm on your shoulder
2021680	2024260	and he just says, Julius.
2024260	2027180	Julius whips around and his like teeth gritted
2027180	2029820	and like fucking spit coming out of his mouth
2029820	2032040	and fucking hit.
2033300	2035860	Cal puts both hands on your shoulders
2035860	2039740	and he says, you're Julius Summers, City Action News
2039740	2041860	and we're here to do a job.
2041900	2044420	Beck has the camera up and is catching this.
2049100	2051140	The turtle's in him.
2051140	2051980	The turtle?
2051980	2052940	I don't know.
2052940	2053860	Sent who?
2053860	2055060	The turtle's in him.
2055060	2057020	Oh, is in who?
2057020	2059940	You look down and you see the body of Chuck Bidwell
2059940	2064700	just absolutely covered in like cuts and blood
2064700	2069420	and is covered in sweat, just like drenched clothes
2069460	2072060	and not lifeless, he's breathing.
2072060	2076380	You can tell like his dry fit green polo
2076380	2079420	is kind of bobbing slowly up and down.
2079420	2082260	Is that medical wrap still lying on the ground?
2082260	2084620	Like, no, but sure.
2086060	2087260	We're gonna take this everywhere
2087260	2089100	and heal all our wounds all the time.
2091620	2093900	Yeah, no, the medical staff took that with them.
2093900	2095320	The only thing that you guys still have
2095320	2096860	is the blood pressure monitor.
2096940	2099220	Which I slap on him to see if he's got any.
2100500	2101340	No.
2103020	2104700	Yeah, you can tell that he's breathing.
2104700	2107020	Is he like bleeding really, really bad
2107020	2109740	or just like kind of minor cuts and stuff?
2109740	2110980	It's not good.
2110980	2114420	There's a pool of blood beneath him and you see-
2114420	2116020	Nobody's ever almost died
2116020	2118940	from falling through a glass window, have they?
2121020	2123340	You can't, yeah, you can't like lose blood, right?
2123340	2124820	Yeah, no, probably not.
2124820	2128340	You definitely can't have an 18 inch long piece of glass
2128340	2131100	stuck in your upper thigh, butt area
2131100	2133260	and then lose a third of your blood
2133260	2137580	and have two blood transfusions on the operating table and-
2137580	2139400	Yeah, not never have your penis work right again.
2139400	2140460	You know, just like-
2140460	2144460	It works, it just doesn't work right.
2145900	2148860	I was describing my shotgun blast to you the other day,
2148860	2150500	right?
2150500	2151340	Yeah.
2151340	2152160	Oh, wait, yeah.
2152160	2153000	Yeah, you said-
2153000	2153840	Is that from that?
2154120	2154960	No.
2154960	2156920	No cilia in your pee hole.
2156920	2158960	That's right, there's no cilia in my pee hole.
2158960	2160560	No cilia in your pee hole,
2160560	2162960	which we all are helpful helpers.
2162960	2165960	I burnt it all out, vaping through my dick.
2168440	2170020	Oh, that sounds rad.
2172680	2175280	How is that the response?
2175280	2176520	I don't know.
2176520	2177680	Well, how did we get to this?
2177680	2182360	Oh yeah, he's cut up and you almost died.
2184840	2185680	Ding.
2186880	2188440	And you all actually see coming up
2188440	2191640	the synthetic bouncy walkway up to the second floor,
2191640	2193200	you see through the glass wall
2193200	2196400	on the east side of the room you're currently in,
2196400	2199960	this pencil-like woman with the spiky hair
2199960	2204560	you know as Barbara Bidwell, the wife of Chuck Bidwell,
2204560	2207480	is absolutely losing her mind
2207480	2211160	as she's running into this room going,
2211280	2215920	oh my God, oh my God, no, no, Chuck, Chuck,
2215920	2217480	what's this, what happened?
2217480	2219600	What happened here, what did you do?
2219600	2221000	Barbara, try to stay sharp.
2221000	2224120	No, I will not, I refuse to stay sharp.
2226120	2226960	Well done.
2229680	2231440	Your husband killed the turtle.
2231440	2232640	Wait, what?
2232640	2233460	Well-
2233460	2234600	The mayor's dead.
2234600	2235420	Yes.
2235420	2236260	And your husband might be too soon.
2236260	2237080	And for a brief moment,
2237080	2239980	I think your husband was the mayor, officially.
2239980	2241820	She's down on the ground now.
2241820	2244940	That's nice, that's if that's any consolation.
2244940	2247520	Hands and knees in glass shards.
2247520	2250420	Now her hands are bleeding, her knees are bleeding
2250420	2254540	and she's, you know, just, it's okay.
2254540	2256540	It's okay, Chucky, it'll be okay.
2256540	2258180	And she's kind of like slapping his face
2258180	2261300	and it's like, wake up, wake up, wake up.
2261300	2263460	Medical, medical!
2263460	2264340	Barbara, Barbara,
2264340	2267100	do you have one of those communicator devices?
2267100	2268420	They're on their way.
2268460	2272260	Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
2272260	2273900	I don't know that they are on their way
2273900	2277540	because they were like on their not way a minute ago.
2277540	2280100	Yes, many of them were already here
2280100	2282260	and then they fled in terror.
2282260	2284260	You might want to try to call them again.
2284260	2286260	It's like they didn't want to help.
2286260	2287460	They didn't want to help?
2287460	2289060	No, that doesn't make any sense.
2290700	2292100	Okay, and she pulls out one of the same-
2292100	2294260	Full disclosure, Julius beat some of them away
2294260	2295400	with a monitor.
2295400	2297620	As she's pulling out her radio device,
2297660	2299380	she looks at you and she's like,
2299380	2302620	well, that's probably why they left.
2302620	2304620	Medical, medical, yeah.
2304620	2306740	We need a medical up to the second floor of the lab.
2306740	2308640	Yeah, right by the entrance.
2308640	2310140	Yes, boys, come immediately.
2310140	2312500	I mean, I know this is a crisis moment for her,
2312500	2314140	but she's got a very sultry voice.
2315420	2317220	As soon as Cal says my name
2317220	2319440	and describes what I did to the doctors,
2319440	2321460	I kind of like come do more.
2321460	2323460	And I'm like, that's fucking, that's ridiculous.
2323460	2327540	So he kind of like sets the blood pressure thing down
2328420	2331820	and he looks at Beck and does the rolling signal
2331820	2334780	and then like tries without asking permission
2334780	2336740	to mic up Barbara.
2337740	2338860	We constantly do this.
2338860	2341360	We're constantly looking back to see if Beck is rolling,
2341360	2342860	even though it's completely unnecessary.
2342860	2344200	It's always, he is always.
2346200	2347460	It's just Joe nodding.
2348740	2350100	He is, he is.
2352540	2354460	What are you doing?
2354460	2356500	No, I'm not being interviewed right now.
2356500	2358540	Medical, medical.
2358540	2359860	She swats your hand away
2359860	2362420	and the medical staff tentatively, oh.
2364420	2366420	Like kind of dip toe in.
2366420	2367720	Inches towards you
2367720	2370500	and they're keeping their distance away from Julius.
2370500	2372500	Julius backs away and puts his hands up.
2372500	2375800	And they are just confusedly looking across at him
2375800	2378220	while moving to do their job,
2378220	2383220	which is to get Chuck Bidwell up onto this bulletin carriage.
2384780	2386100	Wow.
2386640	2387480	Bulletin carriage?
2387480	2388560	He means bull pin cart.
2395220	2396340	That was incredible.
2396340	2397180	Oh my God.
2398140	2400220	Okay, do you not know what bullpen means
2400220	2401420	or what bulletin means?
2403060	2404920	Because only one is Squamous.
2413220	2414940	Let's get him up on this bulletin carriage.
2414980	2416740	Let's get him on the bulletin carriage.
2419140	2421280	Holy shit, I didn't know that's what it looked like.
2421280	2422500	It's a big hat.
2422500	2423580	It's a big helmet.
2425020	2426680	It's a baseball wearing a hat.
2426680	2427520	Yeah.
2429060	2431380	They all look a little different, but the best ones.
2431380	2432700	Wow, that rips.
2432700	2435380	They were really popular in like the late 70s and 80s.
2435380	2437580	And now I'm gonna Google bulletin carriage.
2437580	2439020	Yeah, that's what I thought you were looking up.
2439020	2442380	No, that'll be the dolly image we posted.
2443340	2444700	I'll do it right now.
2446500	2447860	You guys still like that meme, right?
2447860	2448700	Yeah.
2448700	2449520	Of course you do.
2449520	2450360	Of course you do.
2450360	2452300	We're gonna do it enough that it's our meme.
2454580	2458040	Beck is kind of now saying like pass the camera
2458040	2462340	toward the belabored breathing body of Chuck.
2462340	2464060	Dude, you're gonna be fine.
2464060	2467300	Like I had holes in my legs and now I don't, dude.
2467300	2468260	You're gonna be okay.
2468260	2469860	You see a little lung come out.
2470380	2474340	Chuck, you're gonna be fine.
2474340	2477820	Or is it Sandro?
2477820	2478660	What are you doing?
2478660	2479940	He's not awake.
2479940	2481020	What are you?
2481020	2482820	And they're moving him into this cart
2482820	2486020	and they begin to kind of cart him out of this room.
2486020	2491020	The medical staff don't want to be around you three at all.
2491740	2492820	Specifically Julius.
2492820	2493860	Makes sense.
2493860	2494900	So they're trying to get him out.
2494900	2497660	And of course Barbara is just at the side
2497660	2499140	of her husband, Chuck.
2499380	2500860	As the group walks out.
2500860	2503460	So are we now being left in this room by ourselves?
2503460	2504300	Yep.
2504300	2505340	Interesting.
2505340	2508060	I want to look around for interesting things.
2508060	2510980	I would like to perhaps roll the search.
2510980	2512380	Yeah, so this is kind of the first time
2512380	2513500	you guys have looked around here.
2513500	2514900	Go ahead and roll that search.
2514900	2518980	You were previously in a conference room
2518980	2520780	that overlooked this area.
2520780	2522820	So there's a big table off to the side
2522820	2524980	where you guys kind of weren't.
2524980	2526700	Hey, I finally passed a roll.
2526700	2527540	Oh nice.
2527540	2529020	It's a 38 on a 40.
2529900	2530740	I got a 34 and a 60.
2530740	2533420	I got a 42 on a 70.
2533420	2535620	Okay, so success is all around.
2535620	2537060	Success is all around.
2537060	2538700	Wait, did you say 32?
2538700	2539540	42.
2539540	2540900	Oh, I thought you said 32
2540900	2542420	and then we all would have had 30s
2542420	2545180	and that would have been full out.
2545180	2546540	That's crazy.
2546540	2550420	So the room that Chuck busted into was an office.
2550420	2551780	It was an empty office.
2551780	2553260	No one was working in there today,
2553260	2556500	but it just has kind of a spartan desk
2556500	2558740	and anything cool on that desk.
2559340	2562420	Like a key card or secret villain plan.
2562420	2565900	Oh yeah, there's a secret villain plan for sure.
2565900	2567060	As you've seen so far,
2567060	2569860	that you might not need a key card in this whole place
2569860	2572820	as doors don't seem to be too much of an issue.
2572820	2574700	Walls might need a clicker.
2574700	2577740	Yeah, which I see and grab.
2577740	2578560	Yeah, sure.
2578560	2579400	How about that?
2579400	2580240	You grab a clicker,
2580240	2583140	which will be able to open up any doors or walls
2583140	2586220	that you come across while you were here in Grover's Gorge.
2587180	2589020	Fuck yeah, dude.
2589020	2589860	Excellent.
2589860	2591680	Congratulations.
2591680	2592820	Along with that.
2592820	2593660	I'm the mayor now.
2593660	2595500	You all hear murmuring
2596540	2599500	and it's coming from out front of the lab
2599500	2601460	kind of by the statues
2601460	2605260	and it's almost like you can hear a crowd gathering.
2605260	2607340	Is it like where the turtle is?
2607340	2610900	It would be exactly where the turtle was.
2610900	2613120	Maybe we should get out there amongst the mob
2613160	2616720	instead of being directly opposite the mob.
2616720	2620000	If we're inside it filming, getting interviews and stuff,
2620000	2622540	they're less likely to turn on us for killing their mayor.
2622540	2623380	Very true.
2623380	2626040	Also, we don't tell them.
2626040	2628640	Dude, but like, they're gonna pin it on me.
2628640	2630720	I'm already an animal killer here.
2630720	2632640	No, no, no, Beck, Beck.
2632640	2634800	There's no proof of it anymore.
2634800	2635920	He looks at his leg.
2635920	2638840	Yeah, I mean, people saw it.
2638840	2640860	If you guys don't think they're gonna turn on me,
2640860	2642280	I'll go with you, of course.
2642280	2646840	Now, Beck, I know this might seem harsh and even unpleasant,
2646840	2649000	but if they start to turn on you,
2649000	2651840	all you have to do is show them your headphones.
2651840	2653780	Good, good point, dude.
2653780	2656280	They all seem really freaked out by my headphones.
2656280	2657920	That should buy us some time.
2657920	2662920	The trauma of getting godled seems to pause the psyche.
2663560	2665680	Yeah, yeah, man, I like it.
2665680	2666520	I mean, I don't like it.
2666520	2667780	It's awful and it sounds like these people
2667780	2670780	are maybe being subjected to inhumane things,
2670780	2673780	but I like it for our purposes now.
2673780	2675900	Beck looks at Stevie at this point.
2675900	2676860	Yeah.
2676860	2679160	I mean, it seems like we could have been more prepared
2679160	2681060	to enter this scenario.
2681060	2684460	Well, I didn't want you guys to blow my cover,
2684460	2687400	so I didn't want to really give too much away,
2688420	2689260	if that makes sense.
2689260	2692180	I guess now that that's done, it doesn't matter anymore,
2692180	2694900	but I would say we're kind of all in the same
2694900	2697460	fucked situation at this point.
2697460	2699580	Stevie, I understand your reasoning,
2699580	2701460	though if you had told us your identity,
2701460	2703480	it would have allowed us to prepare
2703480	2706220	a more comprehensive infiltration.
2706220	2707520	You make a really good point,
2707520	2709960	and then next time that I do this, I'll let you know.
2709960	2711260	That's all I ask.
2711260	2712100	Okay.
2712100	2714900	When we infiltrate the secret company town
2714900	2716660	on your mom's side of the family.
2718660	2721260	Perhaps give us a couple of weeks to prepare.
2721260	2724820	She laughs and then you see genuine laughter and joy
2724820	2726940	come across her face for the first time.
2726940	2729100	She's been really nervous this whole time.
2729460	2732100	What do you think the chances of us going out there
2732100	2735940	and being apprehended and sent to, I saw the judge,
2735940	2739160	I assumed, god-old jail for killing an animal
2739160	2740700	and maybe the mayor?
2740700	2743380	Hang on, real fast, just so we're all on the same page.
2743380	2745180	We had nothing to do with the turtle,
2745180	2747020	and we're not even lying.
2747020	2748020	Yes, true.
2748020	2753020	I mean, it was quite old, and it needed a lot of makeup.
2754260	2756720	None of us were anywhere near it, right?
2756720	2757560	No.
2757560	2758880	No. No.
2759520	2760360	Can I human that?
2760360	2761320	Yeah, sure.
2761320	2762160	84.
2762160	2763760	Yeah, seems.
2766200	2769720	Let's get a shot of the crowd from above
2769720	2771600	before we join, at least.
2771600	2773620	Yeah, that kind of creeps to the edge.
2773620	2775960	He doesn't want to pull focus up to himself up there,
2775960	2777760	so he's maybe holding the camera out a little bit,
2777760	2779400	using the viewfinder at an angle.
2779400	2782720	Oh yeah, this has to be incognito and stealthy.
2782720	2785480	Otherwise, it's just the three of us standing over
2785480	2788280	at the fucking balcony where they're pointing down.
2788280	2789120	Yeah.
2790560	2792840	Can you guys do that for the shot, though?
2792840	2794320	That one is sobbing.
2794320	2795160	Film her.
2798280	2800780	Yeah, I'm gonna need the videographer roll here.
2804280	2805800	74 on an 80.
2805800	2807360	Ooh.
2807360	2808200	Very nice.
2808200	2811160	You were able to slyly put this in a position
2811160	2815080	where you know that in the ceiling above,
2816080	2818320	there's a pattern to where if most people
2818320	2821260	are looking up toward you, the camera kind of blends in
2821260	2822720	with what would be behind it.
2824200	2825320	Smart man.
2825320	2826160	Nice.
2826160	2828600	The ceiling is just a tesseract of a camera.
2831040	2833480	Yeah, it sounds like a pretty cool ceiling.
2833480	2835920	No, literally, there's just thousands of cameras
2835920	2838580	filming your every move while you're in Donald Gorge.
2838580	2840640	Hey, let me tell you something right now.
2840640	2841840	There's definitely not.
2842960	2844840	Also, to prove our innocence.
2845440	2846840	If you can fucking kill a balrog
2846840	2850120	and make a ravine in a magic town,
2850120	2852400	you probably aren't scared of shit.
2852400	2854240	Yeah, that's a good point.
2854240	2856280	Why would I have a security camera?
2856280	2857520	I killed a balrog.
2859800	2861360	I can't remember, were you saying the stuff
2861360	2863360	about blending into the crowd and character?
2863360	2864600	An excellent idea.
2864600	2867720	Yeah, I'll film interviews and we'll just look like
2867720	2869280	we were doing what we were doing,
2869280	2873520	which is just doing interviews for City Action News.
2873520	2874360	That's what we do.
2874760	2875840	Tell them the truth.
2875840	2876920	That's what we do and that's what we did
2876920	2878120	and that's all that we were doing.
2878120	2878960	Yeah.
2878960	2879800	All right.
2879800	2880960	That's all we saw and that's all we saw.
2880960	2882600	Can crew on three.
2882600	2883720	And he puts his hand up.
2883720	2887620	One, two, three, can crew.
2887620	2890800	And then we reservoir dogs like out of the building
2890800	2893640	all on a line, all very confidently like,
2893640	2895560	I got a tripod over her shoulder.
2895560	2898560	Cal just walks up right to the first crying person.
2898560	2901200	Cal Colorado here on a sad day.
2901200	2904320	Sir, where were you when you heard the mayor had died?
2905160	2910160	The crowd is all staring at you as you come out.
2910400	2915400	You walk past the dried up corpse of Sandra the turtle,
2917160	2919920	put a microphone in the first person's face
2921440	2926320	and the crowd immediately parts and standing there,
2926320	2930160	you see a rail thin man with a balding,
2930160	2931840	mostly already balded head.
2931840	2933960	Is this another pencil person?
2934480	2937520	He's wearing a tattered three piece double breasted suit.
2937520	2938560	Turtle, turtle.
2938560	2943360	But his skin that you can see is bruised and scratched
2943360	2945260	and seems to cover his entire body.
2945260	2947300	But the suit covers most of that.
2948200	2953200	And he is rabid, almost foaming at the mouth.
2954320	2959320	And he drags a long thin cane against the ground
2960200	2961700	as he approaches you.
2962720	2963560	Holy shit.
2964040	2965880	Well now then boys,
2968200	2973200	I do believe that you are under arrest
2974440	2978560	for the murder of our mayor,
2979800	2981960	Sandra the turtle.
2983000	2986840	I believe in fact, no such thing will happen.
2986840	2989040	We had no part in your mayor's death.
2989040	2990120	He was placed carelessly.
2990120	2991580	Roll dodge or fight back.
2992140	2995740	Just Cal who's talking right to him
2995740	2999260	cause he's walking right up to Cal as he drags that cane.
2999260	3001620	Well, Cal rolls a 92
3001620	3003780	and probably gets smacked in the face with it.
3003780	3007200	In the middle of you talking, you're just slapped.
3007200	3009660	Not even for damage.
3009660	3012580	It literally does no hit points of damage to you.
3012580	3015720	It is to shut you up and put you in your place.
3015720	3017660	And he says, now then.
3017660	3020020	Cal doesn't like that because he was telling the truth.
3020060	3022600	Beck just saw Cal get hit with a cane
3022600	3025540	and his reaction is not to stand out.
3025540	3026380	His friend just got hit.
3026380	3028180	Whoa, hey, bro.
3028180	3030420	You can't just go around hitting people with canes.
3030420	3032780	Immediately the tip of his cane is in your face.
3032780	3033620	A guy comes running up.
3033620	3035820	He can, he can, he can.
3035820	3040820	He did, didn't you see it?
3046180	3049720	When he sits back, it's like when Beck saw Cal get hit.
3050660	3054460	Excuse me, but this man is an employee of City Action News.
3054460	3056940	We were invited here to cover your community.
3056940	3058580	He's going to punch you in the nose.
3058580	3060400	If you want to try to dodge.
3060400	3063300	I mean, I'm going to try to like, yeah, I want to actually,
3063300	3066000	I guess if he's throwing punches, we're going to fight.
3067960	3069060	I pass with a 14.
3069060	3070820	Well, then I beat you with a 32.
3070820	3071940	Oh, absolutely you do.
3071940	3073740	So he goes to throw a punch and?
3073740	3076740	Cal catches it and then knocks it aside.
3076780	3080060	Sir, are you not interested in hearing the truth?
3080060	3080940	While he's talking,
3080940	3084620	Julius is going to try to pin a microphone on his.
3087160	3088700	He's distracted.
3088700	3090100	He was trying to fight Cal.
3092420	3094780	You know, this is one of those let it happen moments.
3094780	3096020	Cool.
3096020	3099220	You're just going up and he's literally, he loves it.
3099220	3101380	He looks down and he's like,
3101380	3105520	yes, these words need to be heard, of course.
3106440	3109040	You will know your place, good sir.
3109040	3113440	Now I'm of course, Cal, Colorado city action news.
3113440	3115600	First things first for the viewers
3115600	3118360	who we are streaming live to at this moment.
3118360	3121240	And he wants to like persuade or fluff that guy.
3122800	3124440	Could you please state your name clearly?
3124440	3125520	So go ahead and roll.
3125520	3128720	He's going to roll a human against your persuade.
3130120	3132440	He succeeds with a critical success.
3132440	3133560	Oh shit.
3133560	3135000	I also succeed.
3135360	3136200	I thought you were going to say
3136200	3138360	with a higher critical success,
3138360	3142720	I quit with a 33 and he looks at the camera
3142720	3145320	and he smirks and he looks back at you.
3145320	3147480	Oh yes, of course.
3147480	3152480	My name is the landlord Vernon Covington.
3153800	3155940	And when he says the landlord,
3156920	3161840	you can feel the chill run down the spine
3161840	3166280	of all in attendance of this crowd.
3166280	3171000	Sucks the air right out of this beautiful sunny day.
3171000	3172320	How did you say he was dressed?
3172320	3175640	In a tattered three piece double-breasted suit
3175640	3179160	that mostly covers the bruises and scratches
3179160	3180900	that are all over his body.
3182400	3185700	Beck wants to twiddle his headphones just to try,
3185700	3188640	like as though trying to tempt a dog with a treat.
3188640	3189840	And as you do so,
3189840	3193000	you see that nothing about his suit adds up.
3193000	3196520	It's not nice, which everyone's clothes here are nice.
3196520	3199680	And it's also all over the place color wise.
3199680	3201640	I mean, it probably looks like it's out of the forties,
3201640	3202480	right?
3202480	3203320	Or fifties.
3203320	3205080	Eh, it's just like old shit.
3205080	3205920	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3205920	3207120	It's not like...
3207120	3208360	I mean, style wise.
3208360	3209600	Oh, style wise, yeah.
3209600	3211840	It's just kind of like a big boxy cut.
3211840	3214040	It might even be like eighties or some shit.
3216040	3217880	I love an eighties cut.
3217880	3219040	David Byrne.
3219080	3221280	Do I see the body of the turtle laying anywhere?
3221280	3222520	Oh yeah, they left it out.
3222520	3223780	I think Luke was on the same page as me.
3223780	3226120	I thought this was the personification of the turtle.
3226120	3226960	Yeah, for sure.
3226960	3230240	So at least it's not the body thereof
3230240	3231560	and his name isn't Sandro.
3231560	3233800	So I don't know if this is the case or not.
3233800	3236980	I just thought Luke was expressing his mania
3236980	3240740	about seeing turtle bodies fly into other people.
3240740	3242400	Is that the shit you fucking saw?
3243280	3244360	You gonna talk about it in character
3244360	3245960	or you gonna talk about it out of character?
3245960	3247160	I'm asking my friend, Luke.
3247600	3250560	Will you please let us have a conversation, Zach?
3250560	3253000	No, Vernon Covington is making it very difficult
3253000	3254360	for you all to have a conversation
3254360	3257880	as he is doing his best to keep you quiet and in your place.
3257880	3259560	Yeah, this guy sucks.
3259560	3260680	Yeah.
3260680	3262600	Cal pulls out a gun and shoots him.
3262600	3263440	Yeah.
3268120	3270800	By God, if I'm going to be found guilty of murder,
3270800	3272780	I better damn well be guilty.
3272780	3277780	What authority do you have to place us under arrest?
3279100	3282340	He looks back and in the back of the crowd,
3282340	3286060	you see the judge wearing the powdered wig
3286060	3287780	and the judge's robes.
3287780	3289980	And he looks back and he says,
3289980	3294980	oh, I do believe that the authority is here with us now
3296600	3299380	in order to make a decision.
3299380	3301680	And then he's going to start prodding you
3302640	3305360	like a farmer poking cattle
3305360	3309960	to kind of get you guys to stand all together in one spot.
3309960	3312660	Cal stands right where he is and he says,
3312660	3315540	you're insinuating that the judge over there,
3315540	3318360	that's your authority, but what is their authority?
3318360	3321280	None of you are agents of the state
3321280	3322800	or the federal government.
3322800	3324600	You are vigilantes.
3324600	3327400	You have no right to put us on trial
3327400	3329060	for a crime we did not commit.
3329060	3331980	And I feel, you know, we did not commit this.
3331980	3335620	The judge walks up to the front
3335620	3338580	as you've been making your plea
3338580	3341060	and Vernon Covington looks down at you,
3341060	3344400	smiles really big and starts laughing.
3345900	3346740	Oh my.
3352740	3356300	Where are your courts?
3356340	3359980	Where are your police officers?
3359980	3362660	Where is your law now?
3362660	3365660	You perhaps misunderstand me.
3365660	3368860	I do not dispute that you could do anything
3368860	3372660	to us you might want, but you do not do it
3372660	3375700	with the grace of the law that you spit on
3375700	3377100	and they will come for you.
3377100	3379380	Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
3379380	3382440	but the name Cal Colorado means something in this town
3382440	3386720	and he will not be sacrificed for some fucking turtle.
3386720	3389780	Vernon Covington has been smiling the entire time.
3390680	3393180	He looks at Beck Wilder and Julius Summers
3393180	3397000	and he says, any squawking from the other two?
3397000	3399040	Looks over at Stevie.
3399040	3400520	And you down there?
3400520	3401880	Anything from you?
3401880	3404320	When he looks at Julius, he pokes him with his cane
3404320	3405860	and Julius wants to try to grab it
3405860	3408800	and snap it over his huge fucking thighs.
3408800	3409640	Awesome.
3409640	3410480	Awesome.
3411440	3414760	He's gotta get a bonus for the size of his thighs.
3419640	3421520	I'm gonna use my luck and that's a nine.
3421520	3422920	Wait, was that a contested roll?
3422920	3424680	I'm gonna tell you to not use your luck.
3424680	3425840	Yeah. Okay, yeah.
3425840	3427480	I'm gonna be nice and tell you,
3427480	3429760	no, I think that just seems super fair.
3429760	3431280	I rolled a 77.
3431280	3433440	Oh, so, fail I hope?
3433440	3434280	Nope.
3435120	3437400	That is a critical cane success.
3437400	3438680	Okay, I got a 90.
3438680	3440580	For Vernon Covington.
3445680	3447160	What is it? Is it a nine?
3447160	3448560	Yeah, that's a nine.
3448560	3449720	What the fuck?
3450800	3452800	How many hit points do you have right now?
3455440	3456280	10.
3457280	3458740	What?
3458740	3459580	Why does a cane-
3459580	3461340	Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
3461340	3464440	Like six shots to the face all at the exact same time.
3464440	3466460	Blood starts spurting everywhere
3466460	3469620	and you hit the ground unconscious immediately.
3469620	3470860	What the fuck?
3470860	3473060	Roll constitution to see if you can actually
3473060	3475700	stay conscious at this point in time.
3475700	3478340	As Vernon Covington stands over your body.
3478340	3480940	Cal screams, Julius, no!
3480940	3483540	But then also looks back to see if Beck is filming.
3485620	3486460	He is.
3488060	3491260	Yeah, Julius, I pass my con check.
3491260	3494120	So Julius is on the ground, face bloodied,
3494120	3495940	and also looking blood.
3496420	3498500	And also looking back to make sure he's filming.
3501500	3503780	He's like on the ground, reaching out,
3503780	3505780	and making the like little roll motion.
3506900	3507740	Oh my god.
3508940	3510420	Holy shit.
3510420	3511680	Fuck, dude.
3512740	3514860	What the fuck?
3514860	3516460	I'm almost dead.
3516460	3517540	I don't like this guy.
3517540	3520780	Vernon Covington stands over the body of Julius Summers
3520780	3523020	and looks out to the crowd and says,
3524020	3526540	are there any witnesses?
3528420	3530260	The two medical workers in the crowd
3530260	3533380	kind of raise their hand and one of them speaks up
3533380	3536580	and says, uh, yeah, that one?
3536580	3538500	And points at Julius.
3538500	3542100	That one chased us and tried to hurt us.
3542100	3545260	Vernon Covington puts his hands in the air.
3545260	3550260	Do you not see what kind of men these men are, judge?
3550260	3552620	Men are, judge.
3552620	3555340	So Cal is looking over at Stevie.
3555340	3558620	Do you really think she'll protect you?
3558620	3563620	And there's a glimmer of hope in Stevie's eyes.
3563820	3567360	But as you're staring into those hope-filled eyes,
3568300	3569600	you hear from behind.
3570540	3575540	These men deserve the proper punishment.
3575540	3580540	They should be stoned to death.
3581940	3582780	Fuck.
3585020	3586260	I'll say that one more time.
3586260	3589060	They should be stoned to death.
3589060	3590460	Hell yeah.
3590460	3595460	As soon as I said fuck, I was like, wait, no.
3595460	3600460	As soon as I said fuck, I was like, wait, no.
3625460	3626960	It's all my fault.
3639340	3642820	The sun's reflection off the ocean water amplifies
3642820	3647820	the heat and steam rises, crawling up the wooden boards
3647860	3650060	of a small ship.
3650060	3654940	And as the flag unfurls from the top of the highest mast,
3654940	3659940	the fog dissipates and reveals text that reads,
3660140	3664460	North Atlantic Ocean, Northeast of the Greater Antilles,
3664460	3668340	20th of August, 1694.
3668340	3670700	And then the credits start to come up on the screen
3670700	3673360	for like, you know, before the movie actually starts,
3673360	3676140	but the names of everyone are coming up.
3676140	3678460	And it says, Luke Gensman,
3679780	3681220	Joe Terry,
3681220	3683020	Thomas Cox,
3683900	3685620	Zach Reeves,
3685620	3688240	and Beth May.
3713020	3718020	Teeter totter turtle die.
