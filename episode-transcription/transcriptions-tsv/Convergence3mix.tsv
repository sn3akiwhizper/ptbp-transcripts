0	2000	God damn it, y'all.
2000	5740	Shit just keeps getting weirder and weirder around here.
5740	10000	It's your trap tricky trusted teacher wolf the dog,
10000	14080	and I am no longer surrounded by walls.
14080	16880	From my cage, I can see that there is a lot
16880	21000	of bizarre alien thingies all around me.
21000	25520	Bio luminescence, mushroomy thingies.
25520	28740	What the fuck is going on around here?
28740	31220	I guess the show still must go on.
31220	34540	Bullshit working conditions is what this is.
34540	36620	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from
36620	41380	At Super Nerd Jeff, who is located in Slovenia.
41380	43900	At Super Nerd Jeff tweeted about the show
43900	46460	and tagged At Pretending Pod,
46460	49960	the second coolest thing you can do in Slovenia.
49960	53660	The first, dance with the fairies on Bled Island.
53660	56560	Those little groovers really know how to cut a wool,
56560	58060	if you know what I mean.
58220	60820	And if you don't, do some damn research.
60820	63900	Wolf ain't gonna spoon feed you every morsel,
63900	65540	but I am gonna have.
65540	68220	At Super Nerd Jeff writes,
68220	71220	I hope this message reaches you safely, wolf.
71220	73480	I don't know which lines of communication
73480	74980	are safe these days.
74980	79980	You and the boys are doing God's work over at 694.2 PTBP.
81020	84700	Handlers, agents, and dogs everywhere
84700	87140	could take a leaf out of your creepy freckled
87140	88780	human skin book.
88780	91700	To my own agents, it is coming.
91700	95180	The future we have waited and worked so long for.
95180	98540	Foretold in years past, born of pestilence
98540	100820	and fermented in solitude.
100820	102700	Prepare yourselves.
102700	106360	Much love from the safe house in Slovenia.
106360	109120	Keep up the fine work, fellas.
109120	113060	Now I don't know where your safe house is, Jeff,
113060	115060	but if you ever run into the dragon
115060	117860	that kicks it under Ljubljana Castle,
117860	122100	tell him wolf says he regrets calling him a girthy drake,
122100	124820	and I miss their earthy quakes.
124820	127580	I bet all that's just for Jeff.
127580	132240	Unless a few of y'all have read a book or two on Slovenia.
132240	133780	If you wanna write up something
133780	136060	for your trapped wolf to how,
136060	139340	and then make very specific references to,
139340	141900	tag at pretending pod on Twitter,
141900	144340	tag at pretending pod on Instagram,
144340	146740	tag pretending to be people on Facebook
146740	148700	or fuck Mark Zuckerberg,
148700	151900	or you can write a five star review on Apple Podcasts
151900	155620	and holler about it to pretendingpod at gmail.com.
155620	157660	Also, money.
157660	158660	We'll take it.
158660	161840	If you wanna join the Patreon exclusive t-shirt club,
161840	166040	head on over to patreon.com slash pretending pod.
166040	168580	And remember, if you join our Patreon
168580	172260	or upgrade your tier during the month of November,
172260	173860	we're gonna take that money,
174300	175140	we're gonna match it,
175140	177060	and we're gonna buy blankets and tents
177060	179900	for folks who need them this winter.
179900	184380	You fine folks have already raised $185.
184380	187600	So with PTBP's matching contribution,
187600	192300	we have $370 so far to spend on needed supplies
192300	195080	to help our community get through this winter.
195080	197320	Only 11 days left, y'all.
197320	198780	And how about this?
198780	202260	If we hit $333 from y'all,
202260	203660	that would double on up
203660	207940	to the very cool number of $666.
207940	210340	If that happens, Wolf will give away
210340	214540	a couple fine t-shirts with the PTBP logo
214540	217220	to a couple of fine patrons.

223620	227340	and the fuzzy warm feeling of helping others.
227340	231780	Speaking of fuzzy warm feelings, it's time for the news.
231780	236780	Last time, Incel accused a cool mom of being on drugs,
236860	239460	accused the sheriff of not caring enough
239460	243380	about a missing girl, accused the father of that missing girl
243380	246540	and Alderman of Grover'sville, Tennessee
246540	249020	of being produced by inbreeding,
249020	253180	and emailed Scott Adams, who is either a UFO guy,
253180	255220	the Dilbert guy, or both.
255220	257780	Finally, they called Merle's shut eye,
257780	260500	pretended to be a Clark County deputy,
260500	263420	and learned that Scott Adams has two rooms there
263420	266180	at the same motel they're staying in.
266180	268620	Two rooms for one dude?
268620	271420	Hm, Wolfie is skeptical,
271420	274900	but now for something absolutely impeccable,
274900	277820	it's Brat Pit with Miss Mary.
278220	279940	Psy moves out,
279940	283140	but the eyes hold one throw
288220	291860	I gotta work in the morning
292980	296020	And this shit's so important
296020	298500	So I can't get high
300140	303380	No, I can't get high
305540	307200	Theinge siega die
307860	310580	I can't get high
310580	313780	There must be something inside of me
313780	316500	Does anybody know why?
317940	321140	I can't get high
321140	322820	We're here with David Winters.
322820	323780	David.
323780	324620	Hi.
324620	325620	Luke has a question for you.
325620	326460	Oh, no.
326460	329700	Yeah, so let me set the scene.
329700	331860	We're not recording this though, are we?
331860	334500	No, yeah, we're recording.
334500	337300	Wait, did you get this question from a bigger podcast?
337380	339980	No, I just like thought of it.
339980	342940	I think I was like pooping and I thought of it.
342940	343780	So, all right.
343780	346100	If you make a lie gross enough, no one questions it.
348100	350940	You're accusing me and I resent that.
350940	354080	This is from the dome.
354080	359080	David, you can pick only one movie that Tom Hanks is in
360340	362020	and keep Tom Hanks in it,
362020	365160	but then you have to replace every other movie he's in
365160	366940	with a different actor,
367420	369060	but then you have to pick who that actor is.
369060	371420	So, three part question, two part question.
371420	375660	One, what movie is Tom Hanks going to stay in his role
375660	378760	and then what actor would you replace
378760	381860	every other Tom Hanks role with?
381860	382700	Oh, that's good.
382700	383960	He's gonna stay in Forrest Gump.
383960	384800	That's what I said.
384800	386100	Yeah, he's gonna stay in Forrest Gump.
386100	387420	I know that much.
387420	391240	As far as every other movie.
391240	392740	So like, what are some highlights?
392740	394420	What movies do we need to think about?
394420	396100	Philadelphia Castaway.
397060	397900	Terminal.
397900	398900	Turner and Hooch, Terminal.
398900	399740	Sully.
399740	400560	Sully.
400560	401400	Sully.
401400	402720	Joe versus volcano.
402720	405420	You've got male, Sleepless in Seattle.
405420	407220	You're the captain now, Phillips man.
407220	409740	This is easy too then.
409740	410580	Nicolas Cage.
410580	412420	Oh, nice.
412420	414940	Perfect, perfect answer.
414940	417260	That's better than anything we ever came up with.
417260	420140	Yeah, that's the most chaotic answer you can give,
420140	421480	besides like Gary Busey.
423300	424900	Do you remember the scene in the terminal
424900	428340	where he's in the bathroom and he just starts screaming?
430020	431700	He does the scene for Mandy,
431700	433460	but in terminal. In every movie.
437460	438460	Let's kill some aliens.
438460	439860	What were your answers?
439860	441340	I heard Forrest Gump was a yes.
441340	443960	I said Forrest Gump and then Colin Hanks.
447160	448940	I was gonna keep him in Castaway
448940	451380	and maybe like Sam Rockwell.
451380	454100	Some character actor I think could do all of his oeuvre.
454140	456380	I think Sam Rockwell would be good.
456380	460500	I chose, the movie that I chose is that one
460500	464660	where he is the guy.
464660	467340	I feel like you don't know what you're gonna say yet.
469020	470340	I should have let Thomas go next.
470340	471420	Yeah, I'll give you some time.
471420	475220	I would keep him in the cinematic masterpiece, Cloud Atlas
476500	480780	and replace him and everything else with Danny DeVito.
480780	482100	There you go.
482100	484540	Danny DeVito is Forrest Gump.
486500	488760	That would be the greatest movie of all time.
491060	492940	I'm gonna keep him in That Thing You Do
492940	495300	just to keep that movie pristine as possible,
495300	496940	especially because I talked about that.
496940	499980	I don't want Vin Diesel playing that role,
499980	503460	which is who I'm gonna have play all of the other roles.
503460	505300	I do want Vin Diesel as Forrest Gump.
505300	510300	It's about family, Ginny.
510940	513380	Family is a life of box of chocolates.
514580	516900	You never know what you're gonna get.
516900	518260	Yeah, oddly enough,
518260	520900	the Chronicles of Riddick is all Tom Hanks now.
522900	524380	That would be awesome.
527680	529860	Tom Hanks goes down to Cuba and he's like,
529860	531860	that means we're family.
531860	534980	If the question is instead like whose careers would you flop?
536100	538980	Then Tom Hanks and Vin Diesel is a very fun answer.
542260	544420	And at the end of episode two.
546620	548540	We got some information from a hotel clerk
548540	552380	that Scott Adams was renting a room where we're staying
552380	555480	and there was also, he had a second room full of research.
555480	557340	The hotel clerk knew that that second room
557340	559660	was full of research, if I remember right.
559660	562260	It's amazing that that hotel employee knew.
562260	563140	Maybe he mentions it
563140	564820	at the continental breakfast every morning.
565180	566660	He's like, love this lobby coffee,
566660	568300	really helps me with my research,
568300	570300	which is what I use that second room for.
574220	577100	Did we learn the hotel clerk's name?
577100	578940	You did, it was Riker Yates.
578940	581060	That's right, strong name.
581060	582100	Riker Yates.
582100	582940	You live in New York.
582940	586120	Do you ever just go to Riker Island for fun?
587120	588460	No, not really.
589260	592980	There's better islands, including Manhattan itself.
592980	594620	But yeah, I generally avoid Rikers.
595260	598700	At least what the tourist guides say is try not to.
598700	600040	Do you ever get sent there against your will
600040	601580	for the crimes you've committed?
603180	606100	I don't have to answer that under advice from counsel.
607060	607900	Smart guy.
607900	608800	I plead the fifth.
608800	611700	Not a prereq for my appearance here.
611700	613900	You didn't read the fine print, David.
613900	616180	There's a reason why I have to record this remotely
616180	618100	and I can't fly in for the show.
618100	618940	I'm not allowed to leave the states.
618940	621020	That's the nicest sell I've ever seen.
621180	622020	Yes.
623860	625500	They let you have so many games.
626460	629380	It's true, it's true.
629380	631100	So we're at the hotel.
631100	633020	Well, not really hotel, it's a motel.
633020	634900	And I know that that's near and dear
634900	639900	to certain other detectives' hearts and another property.
640660	643580	This is Merle's shut eye is what you called,
643580	646100	or who you called, the place you called,
646100	648180	the person you called was Riker Yates.
648180	649420	You're still far away though.
649460	650580	If I recall correctly,
650580	654640	did you call on the fancy DEA Crown Victoria car phone
654640	656480	or did you call from the city hall?
656480	658580	I think we called from the office, yeah.
658580	659660	The city hall office, okay.
659660	662380	So you led away the alderman.
662380	664980	Right, I think we told him to fuck off.
664980	667340	Yes, like many of the other NPCs
667340	668620	that you've encountered so far,
668620	670860	you have thoroughly harassed them
670860	673020	asking about disappearing people
673020	676680	and you constantly bring up aliens for no apparent reason
676680	678580	even though that's a complete trigger point
678580	680240	for every resident around here.
681300	682220	Accurate, yep.
682220	683220	You've made a phone call.
683220	687940	It is what, around probably about midnight at this point
687940	690100	on thirsty Thursday night.
690100	690940	Oh yeah, that's right.
690940	692340	Oh yeah, so we could go down to the reservoir.
692340	694860	Thank you for bringing that up.
694860	696820	I had forgotten about it.
696820	698500	The question is, what do you wanna do next?
698500	699940	It's getting late, day one.
699940	702980	Do you guys, do you think we should...
702980	705460	I mean, we're gonna go back to the motel.
705460	706980	Anyway, we gotta stay there.
706980	709860	Should we go crash the kids party?
709860	711240	Go down to the reservoir?
711240	713780	I mean, we should at least drive by probably, yeah.
713780	718020	It would give us a chance to see if there's any connections
718020	723020	in the youth where all these missing kids are coming from.
724300	725540	So-called missing kids.
725540	729340	We have that raging Billy Ray just shouting in pain.
729340	731740	Who fucking knows if there's a lot of kids missing?
731740	734220	Yeah, but if Jane Allen is also missing
734220	738260	and then everyone seems to not be worried
738260	739180	about missing people.
739180	741700	I'm worried that these teens themselves
741700	743020	won't fucking be worried
743020	744580	that any of their friends are missing.
744580	745420	That's a worrying thought.
745420	748700	My theory is that we've only talked to grown adults.
748700	753420	Maybe the younger crew might actually be concerned about it
753420	754940	because it's their friends that are going.
754940	756740	Reservoir would be the place to go then.
756740	760300	What if there's like a scrappy group of role-playing nerds?
760300	761340	Then we kill them.
761340	764820	Who befriend a supernatural bald girl.
767780	770580	How many of them do you think there'd be?
770580	771980	The supernatural kind.
771980	773660	Well, just one, but her name would be Eleven.
773660	778420	Okay, all right, all right, I was just wondering.
778420	781820	Am I off-putting to you, the three of you in this room,
781820	783860	now that it was just the four of us in here,
783860	787180	do I come across as a little too fucking strong?
787180	791140	I like your tattoos, but that whole thing,
791980	793260	I'm not a fan of that.
793260	794100	Why?
794100	794940	I didn't like it.
794940	796420	Sometimes you do say things
796420	800140	that I feel put the investigation in jeopardy.
800140	802420	She's pulling on the sleeves of her cardigan
802420	804060	that she has on,
804060	807620	but she's not using her like cardigan persona currently.
807620	810500	And she kind of pulls the sleeves down over her tattoos.
810500	813700	She had them rolled up from the intensity of the phone call
813700	814980	and the email and the computer.
814980	816300	And as she rolls the sleeves down,
816300	818420	she looks at all of you and her face changes again.
818420	821260	And she's just like, okay,
821260	825940	Cindy Woodabaga is gonna be very, very nice.
825940	827580	Is that better for you?
827580	830820	Joe Dean's face falls, but he doesn't say anything,
830820	832940	but he looks like he's seen this before
832940	834660	and he's even more worried now.
837380	841580	Cindy, is this like a Bruce Banner Hulk situation?
841580	845600	Can we call on that other version of you if we need it?
846600	848800	Just rip my cardigan off
848800	852120	and I guess we'll see what comes out.
852120	854120	It's just, she's still a little flirty.
856640	860720	She runs her fingers down Harlan Nash's chest.
863560	864400	Is that okay?
867400	868640	Sure, for now.
868640	870280	It's better though than before.
870280	871120	Yeah.
871120	872600	Tan gets a little jealous.
873600	876280	How old are Harlan and Tan?
876280	878080	Tan is 38.
878080	879600	Harlan's 46.
879600	880840	I'll be good.
880840	882760	And she looks at her partner, Joe Dean
882760	884160	and her eyes get really big.
884160	885280	I'll be good.
885280	887680	And then we all hop in the car and go to the reservoir.
887680	888520	Yep.
888520	889340	Yeah.
889340	890180	Yep.
891020	891860	Okay.
894180	897360	We wanna make some prank calls on our car phone first though.
903040	904360	Bling, bling.
904360	905600	Hello, White House?
905600	908400	Yeah, let me talk to the president.
908400	909780	How did you get this number?
909780	911480	What are your thoughts on aliens?
913160	914880	We call Murrells County Bunker.
916240	918680	Yeah, grab your prop phone, David.
918680	920200	And I haven't heard the ring yet.
920200	922600	Ring, ring, ring, ring.
922600	924320	Hey y'all, it's Murrells.
925720	929400	Howdy, we're staying down at Murrell's shutout tonight
929400	932200	and we were wondering how long the bunker's open.
933200	934040	Huh?
934040	936120	Well, technically it's open till 12,
936120	940280	but if you say the password, it's open till two.
940280	941620	What's the password?
941620	943760	Big League Chew.
944760	946720	Big League Chew, that's cool.
946720	947560	Yeah.
947560	951320	Hey, ask him if Mr. Jazz is there.
951320	953400	Hey, is Mr. Jazz there?
953400	955280	Hugh Jazz.
955280	956120	Hugh Jazz?
956960	961960	Hey, we got Hugh Jazz in here, anyone?
964640	966120	Oh, hang up, hang up, hang up.
966120	967880	Hey, hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up.
967880	970000	Oh my God, it's just like the Simpsons.
970000	971280	We don't got no Hugh Jazz.
975200	977960	I can't believe it worked, hang up.
977960	978800	I hang up, yeah.
981800	983840	It's just like that animated 10 year old boy
983880	986320	that's taken the nation by storm these last couple of years.
986320	989920	I'm just waiting for, once we get in like a gunfight
989920	992800	for David to just bring a gun out as a prop.
995040	995880	It's like, yeah, I got a phone.
995880	997960	He fires in and bullets come out of our TV screen.
997960	999520	Whoa.
999520	1000340	4D.
1001680	1003200	Four dead.
1003200	1005140	All right, any more prank phone calls
1005140	1006120	before you go to the reservoir?
1006120	1006960	Sure, why not?
1006960	1008520	How many prank phone calls does it take
1008520	1009880	to get to the reservoir?
1010120	1014120	Sorry, your car phone's out of minutes.
1014120	1018200	You only have the 30 minute monthly plan.
1018200	1020240	Two things, first, are we there yet?
1020240	1023640	And second, can I change Ice Cube to my answer
1023640	1025200	for switching with Tom Hanks?
1027520	1030320	Yes and yes, Ice Cube would be good.
1030320	1033720	Is Ice Cube in Law and Order or is that Ice T?
1033720	1035560	That's Ice T, Ice T.
1035560	1036560	Which one's Ice Cube?
1036560	1037520	Ice Cube is the-
1037520	1038600	Are we there yet?
1038600	1039440	Are we there yet?
1039920	1044920	And 21 Jump Street, 22 Jump Street, Barbershop.
1045400	1047480	Man, Barbershop's a funny movie.
1047480	1048300	All right, let's go.
1048300	1049140	It'd be good.
1049140	1049980	What do we see?
1049980	1050800	Well, more importantly, what do you hear?
1050800	1053580	So in between your prank phone calls on the way there,
1053580	1056920	a bump in tune from 1990 comes on.
1056920	1061920	Vanilla Ice's Ice Ice Baby, just to get you in the mood.
1066720	1069360	All right, stop, collaborate and listen.
1069360	1071400	Ice is back with a brand new invention.
1071400	1072240	Something.
1072240	1073400	You guys are holding me tightly.
1073400	1075440	Flowing like a hot daily and nightly.
1075440	1076680	When will it ever stop, yo?
1076680	1077520	I don't know.
1077520	1080360	Turn out the lights and I'll glow to the extreme.
1080360	1081680	I rock the mic like a vandal.
1081680	1085360	Light up the stage and watch me shine like a candle dance.
1085360	1088880	Harlan, they really just had a little bonding moment there.
1088880	1091600	I think your chances with Cindy just went way down.
1091600	1093180	She knew every word.
1094120	1095580	She's good.
1095580	1098880	You go to the reservoir, you encounter,
1098880	1099720	hold on,
1102500	1107500	three teens loitering and a beat up Ford pickup truck
1107880	1110820	and pounding cans of, hold on,
1110820	1113600	I have to roll on my random beer table.
1113600	1114520	Oh, hell yeah.
1114520	1115360	Oh, that's an 11.
1115360	1117500	Is this 13 Mile Island?
1117500	1118340	Oh my God.
1118340	1119480	That's an 11.
1119480	1122320	They're drinking Milwaukee's Best Ice.
1122320	1123160	Excellent.
1124360	1125940	Six percenters getting it.
1125940	1127440	That is, they are partying.
1127440	1129680	David, is that a chart of your own devising?
1130840	1131680	Oh yeah.
1131680	1134620	Were you just going to say that no matter what you roll?
1134620	1135460	No, no, no, no.
1135460	1138000	There's other ones I can roll for you.
1138000	1140200	A two is Colt 45.
1140200	1141040	Oh my gosh.
1141040	1142740	Did you make sure all these beers were on the market
1142740	1143580	in 1990?
1145640	1148800	Anything you can buy in Tallboys in a gas station today
1148800	1150760	probably existed 20 years ago.
1150760	1152800	Like Steel Reserve, Colt 45.
1153920	1155400	Milwaukee's Best Ice.
1155400	1156860	Colt 45 definitely existed
1157220	1161260	because Lando Calrissian was effectively the spokesperson.
1161260	1163100	Yeah, I'm not saying you could have a better time.
1163100	1165540	David, what's your go-to shitty beer?
1165540	1166980	Hold on, let me roll for you.
1169260	1170300	That'd be Bud Light.
1171740	1173340	Missouri, baby.
1173340	1174480	Doody Doody.
1174480	1175540	Anheuser-Busch.
1175540	1176540	Wait, what did they say?
1176540	1177740	In Bev.
1177740	1178700	Wait, what?
1178700	1179640	Doody Doody.
1179640	1180480	Doody Doody.
1180480	1182380	No, Diddy Diddy.
1182380	1183980	Right?
1183980	1185060	Poopy Poopy.
1185060	1186420	I forget.
1186900	1187740	Dilly Dilly.
1187740	1188560	Dilly Dilly.
1188560	1189400	Dilly Dilly.
1189400	1190240	Yes, there we go.
1190240	1191460	That's what we're looking for.
1191460	1193040	Those were bad commercials.
1193040	1194540	I liked the dog ones.
1194540	1195500	Those were good.
1195500	1196340	Anyway.
1196340	1198260	Oh, where the dogs say Budweiser.
1199900	1201620	We're at the reservoir, I guess.
1201620	1202460	Milwaukee's Best.
1202460	1204300	They're crushing Milwaukee's Best Ice.
1204300	1205300	Yeah, the beast.
1205300	1207420	Tan gets out of the car,
1207420	1210180	finds the open 18-pack,
1210180	1212340	grabs one, cracks it open,
1212340	1215060	and just kind of wanders into where the kids are.
1215060	1216860	It's relatively warm.
1216860	1218200	They've been there for a little while.
1218200	1219860	It's a 30-rack.
1219860	1221140	It's about half consumed,
1221140	1223640	so there's about 15 warm cans left,
1223640	1225620	and it gives that distinct,
1225620	1228980	almost gasoline smell as you open it up.
1228980	1231240	And you walk over towards the kids.
1231240	1235620	They're averaging five units of alcohol per person,
1235620	1237780	depending on how long they've been out here.
1237780	1238620	Okay, Joe?
1238620	1240420	Yeah, and it's ice beer,
1240420	1241740	which means it's a little bit higher
1241740	1243540	than your normal three-two.
1243540	1244360	That's right.
1244500	1246120	Going with some loose sluices.
1246120	1247880	Guys, I'm actually,
1247880	1251360	this is kind of my realm,
1251360	1252440	ATF, you know?
1252440	1253800	Oh, that's right, that's right.
1253800	1256680	And he sniffs his beer.
1256680	1257680	This is a good one.
1260400	1261380	I know that is your realm.
1261380	1262760	I don't want to tell you how to do your job,
1262760	1263760	but it would be super cool
1263760	1264960	if you just walked over there
1264960	1266640	and poured it out in front of him.
1266640	1271640	No, he savors the beautiful taste of-
1272020	1273480	The beast ice.
1273480	1274760	Of the ice.
1275800	1277120	Hey, kids.
1277120	1277960	Hey.
1277960	1279920	This isn't super weird to you
1279920	1281960	that we're just here.
1281960	1284560	Well, it's the cool place to be.
1284560	1286760	We got some questions for you.
1286760	1288040	Who are you?
1288040	1290080	Hold on, these guys are clearly nerds.
1290080	1291000	Mine is-
1291000	1293420	Yeah, why are there four random adults here
1293420	1296720	at the reservoir at midnight on a thirsty Thursday?
1296720	1298480	Well, so, you know,
1298480	1300240	we haven't been out to the reservoir
1300240	1302920	for a thirsty Thursday in quite a while.
1303200	1304760	We figured we'd come down here
1304760	1307200	and we just ran into you guys.
1307200	1309840	You don't look like you're from around here.
1309840	1310680	Well, we are.
1310680	1312260	We're older than you, you know?
1312260	1313160	Do you know any- Are you sure?
1313160	1315320	Have any of your friends disappeared?
1315320	1316840	Maybe.
1316840	1318480	I guess they haven't been around.
1318480	1319320	Maybe.
1319320	1320160	Yeah, maybe.
1320160	1321320	What do you mean, maybe?
1321320	1323640	I mean, it doesn't mean they've disappeared
1323640	1324880	just because they're not around.
1324880	1326600	But some of your friends aren't around.
1326600	1328280	I don't know.
1328280	1329880	I'm only 12.
1330720	1334640	It's dark, we should have clocked that right away.
1334640	1337480	Is this kid actually only 12?
1337480	1339220	Give me alertness.
1342440	1344000	I pass, 42 on a 50.
1344000	1346040	I fail, 71 on a 70.
1346040	1347080	Jodine's like, what kid?
1347080	1349120	Which kid are we talking about?
1349120	1351600	I fail as well, 61 on a 60.
1351600	1354120	But only Cindy notices that these children,
1354120	1356760	sorry, these individuals might be children.
1356760	1357920	The rest of you are like,
1357920	1359480	yeah, they're probably adults.
1360360	1361200	It's fine.
1361200	1363800	You know Harlan, Tan doesn't know it yet.
1363800	1366040	But that alcohol, brushing through his system
1366040	1369640	is changing who he is as a person and making him worse.
1371400	1373800	You think he's a liability now?
1373800	1374640	Immediately.
1374640	1376760	Tan is standing there hearing you.
1376760	1377720	He is ATF.
1377720	1378920	It's called research.
1378920	1380400	He probably does know about alcohol.
1380400	1381560	I'm doing research.
1381560	1383240	I don't think you should be drinking right now.
1383240	1385000	I think you should pour that beer out like a hard ass.
1385000	1388940	He continues to take a sip and then says,
1388940	1391340	Jane Allen, what's that mean to you?
1391340	1392980	It's better than their faces.
1392980	1396300	She's an older girl around here.
1396300	1397580	I don't know.
1397580	1398580	You seen her in a while?
1398580	1401780	No, I don't really go to school.
1401780	1404020	Then what do you do?
1404020	1404840	Nothing.
1404840	1407300	Do you remember how you got here?
1407300	1408220	In a car?
1408220	1409180	Who drove?
1409180	1410180	Rocky did.
1410180	1411100	When was that?
1413420	1415380	30 minutes ago.
1415380	1418500	Oh shit, you pounded five fucking ices
1419060	1420420	in 30 minutes each.
1420420	1421540	And these kids are 12.
1421540	1423540	They're like, these kids are just on the ground.
1423540	1425380	Like one of them is already dead.
1427600	1429660	The one with the beard walks over.
1433460	1435100	Why are you bothering my friends?
1437660	1438860	Are you Rocky?
1438860	1439700	Yes.
1439700	1442940	Did you guys drink all of these beers in the last 30 minutes?
1442940	1443780	No.
1443780	1444600	No?
1444600	1446300	No, I'm the designated driver.
1446300	1447360	I would never.
1447360	1448920	They had seven and a half each.
1453320	1456040	Rocky, you know, it just doesn't look like
1456040	1457320	these kids have the body weight
1457320	1459880	for seven and a half Milwaukee's best ices.
1459880	1461920	They seem fine to me.
1461920	1463020	They're passing.
1463020	1463860	You're right.
1463860	1467320	They do seem rather coherent for what they've ingested.
1467320	1469220	Rocky, what do you know about aliens?
1474900	1477040	As he's frustratedly answering,
1477600	1479800	I grab his arm and look at it.
1479800	1480720	Oh my God.
1480720	1481840	Roll me a search.
1481840	1485360	Guys, I really don't think anyone who is around
1485360	1487720	is gonna have these little cuts.
1487720	1491480	Yeah, remember that came with some pretty telltale symptoms.
1491480	1494560	Yeah, I successfully passed.
1498240	1499640	Yeah, you don't see any.
1499640	1501560	The two younger kids, not Rocky,
1501560	1504440	does look like they've pounded seven and a half beers each.
1504440	1506840	However, there seemed to be no effects on them at all.
1506840	1507680	Well, that's odd.
1507680	1508640	Ooh.
1508640	1512000	Yeah, that's what I was talking, yeah.
1512000	1513400	That's fucking nuts.
1513400	1514600	All right, let's get the fuck out of here
1514600	1515760	and go on to the next place.
1515760	1517520	Could we, hey, could we get your names real quick?
1517520	1519800	I'm Rocky Collins.
1519800	1522400	The younger gentleman you were talking to over there,
1522400	1524520	Chester Wisman.
1524520	1526220	I bet you have a lot of fun with that name, huh?
1526220	1530000	Lastly, the woman over there, young lady over there,
1530000	1531760	Chastity James.
1531760	1533380	How old are you, Mr. Collins?
1537120	1540040	I'm 23.
1540040	1541840	Can we roll human on that?
1541840	1542680	Yeah.
1542680	1543520	Yes.
1545960	1547880	I pass. I pass a 60 on a 60.
1547880	1549080	I pass with a two.
1549080	1550420	39 on a 40.
1550420	1551260	Harlan fails.
1551260	1556000	He might be lying and is only 20 and he is just worried.
1556000	1557280	He just seems to be shifty
1557280	1559520	because he realizes you're adults and...
1559520	1562080	Kid, we don't really care how, you know,
1562080	1563320	that you're underage drinking.
1563320	1565480	It's not like we didn't do any of that ourselves,
1565520	1568000	but we just need to know the actual facts.
1568000	1569240	Like, how old are you, son?
1569240	1572680	I am legally obliged to arrest you,
1572680	1575560	but if you help us, I won't.
1575560	1578720	ATF agent, alcohol, tobacco, firearms.
1579720	1580780	It's just a relief.
1580780	1583040	I don't have to do that deep voice anymore now.
1585600	1587800	I'm most concerned at this point
1587800	1590580	that these are actually adults
1590580	1594640	that are now have taken over these 12 year old bodies
1594640	1596400	based on the way that he said that-
1596400	1597440	They just pound in those ices?
1597440	1602200	A, pounding ices, number one, and B, two.
1602200	1604500	He said that woman over there,
1604500	1607380	and then was like, I mean that girl, right?
1607380	1608220	So I think-
1608220	1611080	It's almost like our DM is like respectful and chill.
1612040	1613760	No, that was just bad game.
1613760	1614960	That was bad handling though.
1614960	1616360	I just, I caught myself.
1616360	1617680	Don't read into that.
1617680	1618520	Sorry.
1618520	1620760	I thought I cracked the whole thing open.
1620760	1621600	Nope.
1621600	1624880	So, Mr., what was it again?
1624880	1625840	Rocky Collins.
1625840	1626660	Mr. Collins.
1626660	1627500	Rocky Collins.
1627500	1628320	Mr. Collins.
1628320	1629160	Yeah.
1629160	1631320	So, do you know Jane Allen?
1631320	1632440	No, I don't.
1632440	1633960	We're a couple years apart.
1633960	1637160	You make it sound like she's not around, that's sure a shame.
1637160	1639200	And you don't have any friends
1639200	1642480	that just haven't been around for like three weeks?
1642480	1643720	Not three weeks, no.
1643720	1644560	Two weeks?
1644560	1645380	Any amount of time.
1645380	1646220	One week?
1646220	1647060	Any amount.
1647060	1648280	Occasionally people go places.
1648280	1649120	Where do they go?
1649120	1650200	They go to the big city.
1650200	1651640	They go to the big city.
1651640	1652920	What do they do in the city?
1652920	1655400	They go to the big city shopping.
1655400	1656300	Shopping.
1656300	1657140	That checks out.
1657140	1660120	And they're gone for days, weeks at a time?
1660120	1662400	Oh, sometimes there's some big shopping to do in the city.
1662400	1665280	You gotta get your fancy clothes at the Gap
1665280	1667660	and, you know, back to town.
1667660	1671500	Rocky, has anybody you know ever not come back to town?
1671500	1672720	Not as far as I know.
1672720	1674720	And you were 20, that was correct?
1674720	1675560	Ish.
1675560	1677600	And how old are your associates here?
1677600	1678980	Mid teens.
1678980	1682500	Cindy walks back and gets in the DEA car.
1682500	1683940	Do you want to breathalyze the kids
1683940	1685940	or anything else while you're there?
1685940	1687540	Do you want to sobriety check them?
1687540	1688900	Yeah, let's send them back to Delta Green
1688900	1690100	for testing in there.
1691860	1693160	All right, you hop back in the car?
1693160	1694000	Where to?
1694000	1694820	Murrell's.
1694820	1695940	1 a.m., night one.
1695940	1696780	Murrell's?
1696780	1698980	Wait, the hotel or the bar?
1698980	1699820	I think the bar.
1699820	1701580	The bar, county bunker.
1701580	1702420	Oh.
1702420	1704620	The late night, Harlan, you gonna stay up?
1704620	1707180	What are we going to the bar for?
1707180	1710260	We're gonna have the same conversation we just had
1710260	1713380	but with older people at a bar.
1713380	1715820	Yeah, they gave us the password, so that's cool.
1720260	1724520	As David is just nodding thoroughly and vigorously,
1725860	1728660	Cindy falls asleep in the car as you guys are going.
1729660	1732340	Okay, what if we just leave her in here?
1732580	1737580	She got real calm earlier.
1738020	1741340	Again, this is a brilliant investigative mind
1741340	1743660	but her methods are pretty unorthodox
1743660	1747720	and I've seen her get like this before it really gets odd.
1747720	1751560	Tan rings a doorbell on the bar at the bar.
1752700	1753720	Waking Cindy up.
1757020	1758660	And you go to the door.
1758660	1761260	Murrell's county bunker is literally stylized
1761260	1763500	almost as if it's some sort of bunker.
1763500	1766500	It's a windowless bar, blocky.
1766500	1771260	The front door is almost like it's for a gang hideout.
1771260	1773980	It is a heavy door with like one of those slots,
1773980	1774820	like an eye slot.
1774820	1775660	Ooh, nice.
1775660	1777060	Cop knock, ring, ring.
1781660	1783240	There's a little doorbell on it.
1783240	1784420	Big League Chew.
1784420	1787020	Door slides open, he sees you,
1787020	1791060	Big League Chew closes it, door cracks open, you walk in.
1791700	1794540	It is a half, not liquor store,
1794540	1797860	but more of like a grab and go beer place and half bar.
1797860	1800460	Again, there's no windows, it's dark.
1800460	1804580	It's stylized with those tin branded beer signs
1804580	1807140	all over the place of every which brand.
1807140	1809540	Some of these brands are even now defunct
1809540	1812300	in the early 90s, some of them are more modern.
1812300	1815500	The place smells like that solvent
1815500	1818460	that a really cheap bar has that just permeates the air
1818460	1819980	and that's all you can smell.
1819980	1822820	You can't smell food, you can't smell the beer,
1822820	1826260	it's just that kind of ambient solvent smell everywhere.
1826260	1827700	And there's only the bartender,
1827700	1829260	there's no one else in there right now.
1829260	1831280	Can you roll for some of those signs?
1831280	1832700	Oh yeah.
1834340	1835700	Steel Reserve.
1835700	1837220	Oh look, good one.
1837220	1838060	Steel Reserve.
1839420	1841260	Oh, Rolling Rock, that's fancy.
1841260	1843620	Oh, from the glass line tanks of old Latrobe.
1843620	1846060	That's what they called me in high school.
1846060	1847600	They called you Rolling Rock?
1847600	1848440	That's right.
1848440	1850240	They called me Super Dork.
1853240	1855280	And lastly, Steel Reserve.
1855280	1856980	Oh, another Steel Reserve.
1856980	1857820	This one's a little fancier.
1857820	1858660	I like this one.
1858660	1860080	Yeah, it's a limited table.
1860080	1862480	It's only a D12 table.
1862480	1864480	All right, bartender behind the bar
1864480	1866760	says, well, hello there.
1866760	1868840	Have you ever been abducted by aliens?
1874840	1877840	Every single time.
1878000	1880040	Why is it always the aliens?
1880040	1881360	Oh, sorry, we didn't know this town
1881360	1882720	had any kind of connection to that.
1882720	1885180	That's just kind of his new age pickup line
1885180	1886200	that he's been dropping out.
1886200	1890080	It sounds like you're really upset by this.
1890080	1893520	So how many times have you been abducted by aliens?
1895520	1898360	Me and my partner saw you from across the bar
1898360	1902520	and we thought that you were.
1902520	1906120	We're just the laughing stock, laughing stock of Tennessee.
1906120	1907440	Yes, we're all laughing.
1908200	1909360	I hate it.
1909360	1910200	Pointing and laughing.
1910200	1913840	I hate being the laughing stock of Tennessee.
1913840	1914680	Who hates it?
1914680	1915500	What's your name?
1915500	1918680	My name is Arthur Doyle.
1918680	1919600	Arthur C. Doyle?
1919600	1920480	Just Doyle.
1920480	1922600	But really, though, how many times?
1922600	1923520	Never.
1923520	1924600	People always ask that.
1924600	1926480	There ain't no abductions around her.
1926480	1928960	You don't know anybody that's been abducted or?
1928960	1929800	No.
1929800	1932240	Abducted from their Sherlock Holmes, maybe?
1932240	1935420	No, ain't nobody been abducted around here.
1935420	1937160	We have some Moriarty questions.
1938280	1939560	Okay.
1943640	1944480	Jesus Christ.
1945860	1949800	You Sherlock harassing the locals, I've noticed.
1949800	1952720	People have been talking about these agents
1952720	1957720	going around town, asking questions about the aliens.
1957760	1959240	And that upsets people?
1959240	1960560	Yes, sir.
1960560	1964400	Is it because you like these aliens and you don't want to?
1964400	1965680	No!
1965680	1967040	We don't like no aliens.
1967600	1968440	We just want to live in peace.
1968440	1970640	So you don't want the aliens to be here anymore?
1970640	1971840	What aliens?
1971840	1972960	The ones you don't want here.
1972960	1974200	What are you talking about?
1974200	1976140	What are you talking about?
1976140	1980240	Why do you just keep asking questions about aliens?
1980240	1981180	You tell us.
1982080	1983180	Hey!
1983180	1984900	Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
1984900	1986880	Sorry to bring up the aliens.
1986880	1987840	Can I have a water?
1987840	1989720	Do you know who killed Jane Allen?
1989720	1990560	Yes.
1990560	1992120	You do know who killed Jane Allen.
1993880	1996080	He pours each of you a water
1996080	1997960	because the nice old lady asked for one
1997960	1999920	and you've been out all day.
1999920	2001100	I chug it.
2001100	2001940	You chug it?
2001940	2002760	Okay.
2002760	2005200	And I've still got my Milwaukee's Best ice
2005200	2006440	from the reservoir.
2006440	2007400	Hey, hey!
2007400	2009760	No outside beverages.
2009760	2011400	No outside beverages.
2011400	2012740	You gotta shop parrot.
2012740	2015600	Tan chugs it and then goes back to his line of questioning.
2015600	2017600	Who gives you the right to do that?
2017600	2021600	So did you kill Jane Allen or who did it?
2021600	2026440	Why are you accusing me of killing Jane Allen?
2026440	2030240	Well, so it sounds like somebody did kill her then, right?
2030240	2031060	Based off what you just said.
2031060	2031900	I don't know.
2033160	2034600	I didn't say that.
2034600	2035640	That's what I heard.
2035640	2037800	We just tried this with him and he did not crack.
2037800	2041440	So let me guess, nothing is happening
2041440	2043940	that is strange or unusual in this town.
2043940	2044780	Correct.
2044780	2045600	Everything is fine.
2045600	2046440	Yeah.
2046440	2048800	Any of your friends been out of town for a while?
2048800	2049640	No.
2049640	2050560	Oh good, any of your friends?
2050560	2051920	Got no friends.
2051920	2053220	I work hard.
2053220	2055100	I'm always here at the county bunker.
2055100	2059440	You don't make friends with any of the regulars?
2059440	2060440	No, they're my customers.
2060440	2061280	I get that.
2061280	2062100	You gotta keep that distance.
2062100	2067100	Are you aware of a Billy Ray Spivvy, Spivvy?
2067480	2068320	Yeah, that boy.
2068320	2069300	Has he been in here?
2069300	2071080	Does he frequent this establishment?
2071080	2072080	No, sir.
2072080	2074080	I check IDs.
2074080	2075380	Thank you very much.
2075380	2077340	I see that guy over there with the ATF badge
2077340	2078840	trying to trip me up.
2078840	2079680	No, sir.
2079680	2081240	No children in this bar.
2081240	2082280	Can I humint that?
2082280	2083120	Sure.
2086000	2086840	Fail.
2086840	2088600	93 on a 60.
2088600	2090800	Everyone in the bar looks 12 now.
2092240	2096040	Does Scott Adams come in here much?
2096040	2098480	Oh, oh, that guy.
2098480	2099300	Yeah.
2099300	2101560	He's poking around just like you,
2101560	2103800	asking about them UFOs.
2103800	2105720	Told him he wasn't allowed to come back here.
2105720	2107720	Is that, oh, you kicked him out.
2107720	2109440	He was harassing my customers.
2110040	2111720	Was his line of inquiry similar to ours,
2111720	2113720	or was he asking different things?
2113720	2115600	Basically the same stuff.
2116480	2117320	This is just a person.
2117320	2118760	Do you think it was the fella from Dilbert?
2118760	2121560	I ain't seen him making no comics while he was here,
2121560	2122800	if that's what you're asking.
2122800	2124480	What have you seen him doing while he's here?
2124480	2127120	Harassing my customers.
2127120	2128640	Asked and answered, fair enough.
2128640	2130520	Thank you very much for your time.
2130520	2132380	I'm gonna have to ask you to leave now.
2132380	2133220	That is what?
2133220	2135400	You have thoroughly wasted enough time,
2135400	2136560	and now this bar has to close.
2136560	2137840	Thank you, Z.
2137840	2139560	Ushers you out the front door.
2139560	2141860	Are we like right next to the motel?
2141860	2142880	You're very close, yeah.
2142880	2144340	Both are on the outskirts of town.
2144340	2145700	They're both owned by Murrells.
2145700	2147400	They're conveniently close enough
2147400	2150460	that you could walk from the county bunker to the motel.
2150460	2152920	And what time is it, like one in the morning right now?
2152920	2153740	Two.
2153740	2154580	Bar closed at two.
2154580	2155420	Yep.
2155420	2157440	Do you think it's too late to go try to talk to him?
2157440	2158480	I'm so tired.
2158480	2160860	I'm tempted to turn in myself
2160860	2163040	and get this with fresh eyes.
2163040	2164980	I've gotta sleep and shit and piss,
2165820	2167720	and eat, apparently.
2168980	2170280	Do we each have our own room
2170280	2172060	or are we all staying in the same room?
2172060	2173380	Are you gonna check in?
2173380	2174420	Yeah, let's go check in.
2174420	2175260	Yeah.
2175260	2176420	So you walk over to the hotel,
2176420	2178860	you go to talk to Riker Yates.
2178860	2180900	However, there's a sign up saying,
2180900	2184260	the manager is not on duty, please check in at 10 a.m.
2184260	2186700	You get to sleep in your cars now
2186700	2189220	because you didn't even bother to check into the motel.
2189220	2190820	I think Harlan saw the sign
2190820	2192980	and was already walking back to the Bronco.
2195180	2198460	Wait, do we know which hotel room?
2198460	2199460	No, we haven't checked in.
2199460	2200900	No, no, Scott.
2200900	2202620	Oh, that Scott was in.
2202620	2203780	We do?
2203780	2205220	No, we didn't get room numbers.
2205220	2206860	No, you didn't get the number out of them.
2206860	2210340	Can I do a search for a book that has customers?
2210340	2212240	So you're gonna break into the...
2212240	2213820	We're still on the outside.
2213820	2215140	We haven't made it into the lobby.
2215140	2216420	Oh, we're not inside the lobby?
2216420	2217260	No.
2217260	2219420	There's no lobby, so this is, I should say,
2219420	2222540	standard motel, doors open outward,
2222540	2224220	and it's actually, you know what,
2224300	2225220	I'm just gonna give you a map.
2225220	2226060	How about that?
2226060	2227500	Ooh. Perfect.
2227500	2231860	So, 11 room motel, L-shaped.
2231860	2235780	The rooms on one side of the L are kind of double units,
2235780	2238060	two double beds plus kitchenettes.
2238060	2240100	And then there's this, on the other side of the L,
2240100	2242940	it's just standard rooms where it's some beds
2242940	2245580	and then a bathroom, and that's pretty much it.
2245580	2247860	And then in between, in like the joint of the L,
2247860	2249300	there's a manager's office.
2249300	2251300	Right, is that locked?
2251300	2253180	The office is locked, so it has that sign
2253180	2254700	saying basically, come back tomorrow.
2254700	2255540	Yeah.
2255540	2258180	I'm not gonna sleep in the car.
2258180	2259800	I don't know if Scott's a nice guy or not,
2259800	2261620	but I'm gonna go find him.
2261620	2263060	No, you're not.
2263060	2265580	I would not advise just knocking on doors
2265580	2266420	at two in the morning.
2266420	2268060	Hold on, real quick, who's in charge of this?
2268060	2269200	Oh, yeah.
2269200	2272440	Sorry, guys, you're not actually full Delta Green.
2272440	2274940	Oh, yeah, we're in charge of this task force.
2274940	2276380	You're the friendlies, we're the agents.
2276380	2278260	You're gonna sleep in your car tonight.
2278260	2279080	That's fine with me.
2279080	2281100	It's actually something I do pretty often
2281100	2282340	in my line of work.
2282500	2284140	Aw, that's sad.
2284140	2287260	It's not, it's just, we stake out places.
2287260	2288940	We have to make sure that we see the comings
2288940	2290420	and goings of people pretty often.
2290420	2291620	It's not sad they have steak.
2291620	2292980	I guess I'll do it.
2292980	2294780	Typically, when I sleep in my car,
2294780	2297620	it's cause it's like outside of the casino.
2297620	2300500	I had a bad night, so it's kinda not a great feeling
2300500	2301700	for me, but I guess I'll do it.
2301700	2302660	Well, you'll have a friend.
2302660	2304980	It's not a great feeling for anybody, bud,
2304980	2307540	but we're gonna be doing that for the next,
2307540	2309860	probably till like 6 a.m., it's only like four hours.
2309860	2311620	Yeah, he goes back to the Bronco.
2311620	2314420	Are you talking outside about all of this,
2314420	2316040	like standing outside of the office?
2316040	2317140	Defo, yep.
2317140	2318740	Okay, so as you're doing that,
2318740	2320860	eventually towards the end of the conversation,
2320860	2322940	the lights turn on on the inside.
2322940	2324660	The manager's apartment was back there,
2324660	2327300	so Riker actually lives inside the hotel,
2327300	2330220	and he overheard you talking loudly.
2330220	2332360	It's still September, he had his window open,
2332360	2334520	and eventually all the bickering about cars
2334520	2336600	and sleeping in the car and stuff woke him up.
2336600	2338980	So he comes out in his pajamas,
2338980	2343100	like a nice proper two-piece striped pajama suit,
2343100	2345860	a very handsome gentleman comes to the door,
2345860	2348180	all bleary-eyed.
2348180	2350920	Let me guess, let me guess,
2350920	2353100	you're those agents or whatever that call the hat, right?
2353100	2355740	DEA Task Force, yep, investigating Superman.
2355740	2357500	We're awfully sorry, sir.
2357500	2359940	Come on, come on, come in, come in, come in.
2359940	2362660	We appreciate you getting up out of bed for us.
2362660	2363660	Your nation thanks you.
2363660	2365360	Ah, I already, here, paperwork,
2365360	2367580	what, I just, I wanna go back to bed.
2368060	2370500	Just give us the keys, and we'll do it all tomorrow.
2370500	2371340	How about that?
2371340	2373840	All right, we got you in,
2373840	2376180	we got four different double bedrooms.
2376180	2377020	Perfect.
2377020	2379820	Yeah, you're in rooms six to nine.
2385040	2387500	I don't know why that's funny, but it got me.
2387500	2388820	I'll take the six.
2388820	2389860	I'll take the nine.
2389860	2391740	Seven's my lucky number, so.
2391740	2393540	I get the set leaves me with eight.
2393540	2396700	Oh, infinity on its side, like that man's tattoo.
2396740	2398180	Maybe it's lucky.
2404300	2405580	Does everyone go to bed?
2406620	2410060	Before we get to the rooms, I do wanna ask Riker
2411660	2412660	just a bunch of questions.
2412660	2414260	No, I just don't wanna ask him what rooms
2414260	2415660	Scott Adams is staying in.
2417660	2419260	Which rooms are the aliens in?
2419260	2420100	Yep.
2421000	2422820	Thank you for showing us to these rooms, Mr. Riker.
2422820	2424700	Now, we understand you have a guest here
2424700	2426820	staying with you, a Mr. Scott Adams.
2426820	2429020	How, how do you know that?
2429020	2430340	We heard from in town.
2430340	2432900	We're investigators, this is part of our investigation.
2432900	2433740	Oh.
2433740	2434620	Into super myth?
2434620	2436220	We're figuring it out, it'll be okay.
2436220	2437060	Super myth.
2437060	2437900	It'll be all right.
2437900	2438720	We just need to ask him some questions.
2438720	2439560	Just let us know which room he's in.
2439560	2441100	Your hotel is not in danger.
2441100	2443660	Room 10, you rented 10 and 11.
2443660	2444780	10 and 11?
2444780	2445620	Mm-hmm.
2445620	2446440	Okay.
2446440	2448940	Thank you so much for, I'm sorry to wake you up,
2448940	2452220	but I was not looking forward to sleeping in that car,
2452220	2453180	so thank you.
2453180	2454460	It's fine.
2454460	2455780	It's fine.
2455780	2458660	He turns around, goes back in, lights off.
2458660	2462860	Tan goes, goes to bed, he plays a little online poker.
2462860	2464100	No, he doesn't.
2464100	2464940	Yeah.
2466940	2468540	Thomas, get it through your head.
2468540	2472300	We don't know what existed in the 90s.
2472300	2473140	I know you're 17, but.
2473140	2475580	Oh, you're right, he doesn't.
2475580	2477340	He plays one of those little handheld machines.
2477340	2478180	Oh, yes.
2478180	2480140	It's like a double A battery.
2480140	2480980	Yeah.
2480980	2483900	Every time you like hit something that's at least
2484620	2487100	what, at least three of a kind or whatever,
2487100	2489500	it plays that we're in the money tune.
2489500	2492020	Yeah, monophonic.
2492020	2492940	Yeah.
2492940	2496260	He does that until he loses five times in a row,
2496260	2499380	and then Zs.
2499380	2501620	Anyone else doing anything before bed?
2501620	2503260	Taking a shower, doing anything else?
2503260	2507180	Harlan, he would flop on the bed fully clothed.
2507180	2508020	Okay.
2508020	2512340	Cindy puts away all of her clothes in each of the drawers
2512340	2516860	in the motel room and then goes and sets up her toiletries
2516860	2521540	at the bathroom sink and does her good night face wash,
2521540	2525100	puts on a face mask and then heads to bed
2525100	2527380	and has a full blown nightmare.
2528420	2530860	Joe slash Thomas, any special plans?
2530860	2534100	Yeah, Joe walks outside of his room and smokes a cigarette
2534100	2536900	and he wants to take a look at the outside
2536900	2538340	of rooms 10 and 11.
2538340	2541780	What is your alertness skill?
2541780	2542700	70.
2542700	2543820	Okay, well, all right.
2543820	2545940	Well, with a 70, you don't even have to roll.
2545940	2548380	The one thing you notice between the two rooms,
2548380	2550860	the room that was identified as Scott Adams' room,
2550860	2553780	so that's room 10, there's a little bit of cloth
2553780	2556260	sticking out from under the door.
2556260	2559460	It looks like a towel, like a standard hotel towel
2559460	2561220	kind of peeking out from underneath the door.
2561220	2562700	It's getting blazed in there, dude.
2562700	2564500	Like somebody had rolled one up under the door.
2564500	2566980	Yeah, and other than that, you also notice
2566980	2569100	the blinds are closed, but you can kind of see
2569140	2572220	through the blinds, nothing on the other side.
2572220	2575100	It's dark, almost as if there was a blanket put up
2575100	2578580	over the top of the closed blinds.
2578580	2580780	If I put my ear up to the door,
2580780	2583620	do I hear any sounds or activities, movements?
2583620	2586180	I'm not even gonna make you roll, you hear nothing.
2586180	2587060	Okay.
2587060	2589700	He uses the bathroom, takes a shower and goes to bed.
2589700	2590540	Okay.
2591660	2592860	Everyone sleeps through the night.
2592860	2595340	You wake up, reasonable hour.
2595340	2597940	You notice the office is back open up front.
2597940	2599500	The lights are on again.
2599500	2601020	There's a little bit of movement.
2601020	2602500	However, there's not that many other cars
2602500	2603340	in the parking lot.
2603340	2607620	There's one van, your Bronco, your Crown Vic,
2607620	2609940	and then another rental car.
2609940	2612860	It looks to be a Ford Escort.
2612860	2615580	Are either of those parked in front of 10 or 11?
2615580	2616740	The Escort is.
2616740	2618820	The van's towards the other side
2618820	2621060	where the other rooms are on the other half of the aisle.
2621060	2622500	And you said we could tell it was a rental?
2622500	2625060	Escort is definitely a rental.
2625060	2626740	It's unclear of the other one.
2626740	2630860	When Tan wakes up, he goes into the office and asks,
2630860	2634300	do you have any coffee or food
2634300	2638460	or where should I go for that kind of stuff?
2638460	2643180	I'd recommend the Mega Deuce if you want a big meal.
2643180	2647220	But if you want a small meal, I got some coffee over here.
2647220	2648740	You know, your offices are the law.
2648740	2650860	I can cut you in on some donuts.
2650860	2653060	I appreciate that, but I'm a little hungry.
2653580	2657940	Tan leaves the office and knocks on your respective doors.
2657940	2660780	Hey, you guys wanna go to the Deuce to get some breakfast?
2660780	2662900	And maybe we can ask Scott to come with us.
2662900	2666660	You hear a scream when you knock on room number six.
2666660	2668380	And she's just like, ah!
2668380	2670700	I try to open the door and get in.
2670700	2672420	Cracks the door and she's like, sorry.
2672420	2674660	And she is drenched in sweat.
2674660	2676820	I mean, just like she jumped into a pool.
2676820	2678140	And she's like, let me shower.
2678140	2679100	I'll be right out.
2679100	2680660	I'm sorry, Miss Woodabaga.
2680660	2681500	Take a shower.
2681540	2684460	I think maybe we could take Scott to breakfast.
2684460	2685700	I think that's a great idea.
2685700	2686740	Do you wake up Cindy?
2686740	2688540	You wake up the other two as well?
2688540	2690300	Yeah, I knock on their doors as well.
2690300	2692900	Harlan just splashes some water under his pits
2692900	2697020	and puts on a new black polo from his suitcase.
2697020	2698940	That's the only difference.
2698940	2702740	Tan did not really plan for an overnight stay,
2702740	2705020	even though he totally knew that it was happening.
2705020	2708620	So he's still wearing the baby blue polo shirt
2708620	2710980	that the neck has been stretched out.
2710980	2714260	But he's happy and he's stoked to go eat breakfast.
2714260	2716580	Jodine is wearing a fresh white polo.
2716580	2720980	He nods approvingly at Harlan's sharp, fresh black polo.
2720980	2724340	And he puts on some sunglasses and says,
2724340	2726340	yeah, let's get some grip.
2726340	2730540	When Cindy comes out, the four of us stand at door 10.
2732140	2734060	Bring, bring, bring, bring.
2735660	2737580	No doorbells, unfortunately.
2737580	2739980	Old fashioned knocking, no answer.
2740020	2743100	We go to 11 and do the same thing.
2743100	2746540	You go to 11 and knock and no answer.
2748020	2751660	Scott, Scott, Scott.
2753500	2754940	Mr. Adams.
2754940	2755780	Nothing.
2755780	2760140	So while you're shouting, the manager hears you.
2760140	2762860	Riker peeks his head out, looks at you,
2762860	2765140	realizes kind of what's going on,
2765140	2766900	goes back behind the counter,
2766900	2769000	grabs some keys and comes out to you.
2770260	2772380	You're looking for Scott, you said?
2772380	2773420	For Mr. Adams, yeah.
2773420	2776020	Yeah, can you open his door up?
2776020	2776940	Do you have a warrant?
2776940	2777780	Do you have a warrant?
2777780	2780220	Well, this is more of a safety check.
2780220	2782500	Yeah, we believe he might be in some danger.
2782500	2783420	Danger from what?
2783420	2785580	Well, I think he might've fallen in his bathroom
2785580	2787700	or something, but I heard a big clunk
2787700	2789460	and it sounds like we need to get in there pretty quick.
2789460	2792100	Yeah, you wouldn't want anyone to die in your motel,
2792100	2792940	would you?
2792940	2795900	No, no, no, no, that'd be really bad for business.
2795900	2797580	It sounded bad, it sounded nasty.
2797580	2799460	Goes in, unlocks the door and says,
2799460	2801340	please, please, just go ahead.
2801340	2802820	He was like, if I live, I'm gonna sue.
2802820	2806180	We're like all like showing eyes to each other,
2806180	2808020	like as soon as we get in there,
2808020	2811160	we search everything as fast as we can.
2811160	2813540	You open and the second that door cracks open,
2813540	2815820	you catch a really bad odor.
2815820	2817300	Yeah, it's that kind of bad odor.
2817300	2818460	Yeah, okay.
2818460	2820740	It's very, very dark because of that blanket
2820740	2824500	that you can see now was duct taped over the window.
2824500	2827740	Looking around, you see a couple of different things.
2827740	2831260	You see the blankets that have been pulled off the bed
2831260	2834300	and used for that, so clearly the bed is unmade.
2834300	2836540	You see two piles of clothing.
2836540	2838780	One of them is just kind of thrown in the corner.
2838780	2841260	The other one is neatly folded on the table.
2841260	2844680	You also see a Macintosh PowerBook.
2844680	2846180	Is that like a laptop?
2846180	2847100	That's a laptop.
2847100	2850140	That's what laptops looked like in the early 90s.
2850140	2853020	But you see one of those bad boys plugged into the wall.
2853060	2855500	You see a series of documents,
2855500	2857460	junk food containers on the floor,
2857460	2859240	and that's pretty much all you can see
2859240	2861180	as you walk into the room.
2861180	2862780	Cindy failed her search check,
2862780	2865660	and so with that smell, as soon as it hits her nose,
2865660	2868020	she's like, nope, nope, not for me.
2868020	2869260	Can't be around any of that,
2869260	2871060	and just walks out back outside.
2871060	2873460	Tan also failed his search role,
2874380	2879380	and he feels physically sick and joins Cindy.
2880380	2882060	I pass my search role.
2882060	2883100	It's a 68.
2883100	2884740	I passed with a 17.
2884740	2887780	So Joe Dean and Harlan both pass.
2888780	2890460	Most of this stuff is very obvious,
2890460	2892140	kind of what you're seeing.
2892140	2895620	You do see some journals sitting around
2895620	2898540	that you didn't initially see on the first pass.
2898540	2901480	Just those spiral notebooks that kids would use in school,
2901480	2903420	and scrawled on the front of one of them
2903420	2905500	is Grover'sville Notebook.
2905500	2908220	He uses wide-ruled spiral notebook,
2908220	2910620	which also makes you kind of question his sanity,
2910620	2914700	why anyone would use the wide-ruled versus college-ruled
2914700	2917500	as an adult, but you know, it happens.
2917500	2918760	I also want to be clear.
2918760	2922460	You've only checked the one bedroom area.
2922460	2925660	There is still a rotten smell to be discovered.
2925660	2927760	When Tan leaves the room,
2927760	2930040	he's like, can't deal with that smell.
2930040	2933100	Hey, hey, Cindy, maybe we go check out the other room?
2933100	2935720	Yeah, we can go check out the other room.
2935720	2938400	Let's let them keep working on this one.
2938400	2940320	But in the meantime, that's what we'll be doing.
2940320	2942880	Yeah, sure, but you know that all four of us
2942880	2944680	can't talk all at the same time.
2944680	2946120	Technically we could, but.
2946120	2946960	I don't think so.
2946960	2947780	Let's try it.
2947780	2948620	We're doing it right now.
2948620	2949460	Start talking.
2949460	2950960	No one would want to listen.
2950960	2954280	So two of you are going over to the furthest room,
2954280	2955160	the storage room.
2955160	2956860	Two of you are still searching
2956860	2959520	in the Scott Adams primary room.
2959520	2960760	You're in the bedroom.
2960760	2962200	Are you checking out the notebook then?
2962200	2963280	That's what you want to do?
2963280	2966080	Well, I mean, so is there like a closed bathroom door
2966080	2969240	staring at us or a lump under the covers?
2969240	2970840	Slightly a jar bathroom door.
2970840	2972000	There's nothing under the covers.
2972000	2973120	The bed is definitely empty.
2973120	2974880	Okay, I have picked up the notebook,
2974880	2978760	but I do want to kind of kick open lightly with my foot,
2978760	2980080	the bathroom door.
2980080	2981160	And Harlan, where are you?
2981160	2982680	So I just succeeded to search.
2982680	2984520	Well, you told us there were two journals.
2984520	2986100	What's the other journal?
2986100	2990520	The other journal is just some like random UFO nonsense
2990520	2992920	related to his watch the skies.
2993920	2995240	It's like a log book.
2995240	2996380	Those assorted documents.
2996380	2998920	Can I look at those a little closer with that search rule?
2998920	3000440	It's going to take you some time.
3000440	3003300	So I'll let you kind of go through them in a little bit,
3003300	3004880	but you're not going to be able to necessarily do it
3004880	3005720	in real time.
3005720	3007040	It's just, it's a mess.
3007040	3011920	This room's been not necessarily like ransacked,
3011920	3014540	but it's just in complete disarray.
3014540	3015380	Yeah.
3015380	3017000	Yeah, I'm sitting there looking through that stuff
3017000	3018500	and he's going to the bathroom.
3018500	3020400	So we'll kick off with Joe Dean
3020400	3021600	before we get to the other room.
3021600	3024920	So Joe Dean, you get to the bathroom
3024920	3026780	and once the door is fully ajar,
3026780	3028720	you see where the smell is coming from.
3029840	3033680	You see a heavyset man in the bathtub,
3033680	3035840	roughly 34 years old in age,
3035840	3038200	curly black hair and a bushy beard.
3038200	3041320	He's in boxer shorts and wearing a t-shirt
3041320	3044760	Knoxville Fantasy Con 1989.
3044760	3047900	He's up to his chest in water.
3047900	3049840	Clearly the stopper is in the tub.
3049840	3054040	To make matters worse, that water is deep red
3054040	3058300	because you see numerous self-inflicted slashes
3058300	3062720	all over his body, arms, legs, everywhere.
3062720	3064640	Specifically the arms and legs.
3064640	3067040	Specifically the arms and legs.
3067040	3070760	You see floating in the water, just a single razor blade.
3072560	3074440	If I look at back into the room,
3074440	3078640	are there signs of an individual maybe like increasingly
3078640	3080720	succumbing to this kind of pain?
3082040	3084320	Is that how the room looks destroyed or?
3084320	3086160	No, no pain medication.
3086160	3088480	I guess what else did Billy Ray have
3088480	3090560	that was kind of obvious?
3090560	3093320	He talked about eating a lot and being hungry.
3093320	3096820	You see some takeout containers, but nothing crazy.
3096820	3099720	Yeah, not really a heck of a lot.
3099720	3101340	Okay, well then I guess the last thing
3101340	3104000	we wanna do in here is look at his computer.
3104000	3105600	Are you gonna do anything with the body?
3105600	3108560	I close the bathroom door and try to mitigate the smell
3109440	3110280	and I kind of motioned to Harlan.
3110280	3112680	I'm like, he's in there, you can have a look.
3112680	3116140	Harlan, like even wordlessly is just like an affirmation.
3116140	3118800	Like I knew he was gonna be in there.
3118800	3119640	You should look.
3120920	3122600	You wanna see a dead body?
3122600	3124200	You wanna see a dead body?
3124200	3126760	Do you need a second opinion?
3126760	3128460	I will check, of course.
3128460	3130880	I just, from Thomas to Joe,
3130880	3133740	Harlan should see the insane way in which he died.
3133740	3135120	And then either I can describe that to you
3135120	3136740	or you can go look a look, take a look.
3136740	3140780	Yeah, I mean, I'm researching documents,
3140780	3142100	but I can go look in the bathroom.
3142100	3143060	You wanna look at the body?
3143060	3144400	I do, I guess I'll look at the body.
3144400	3147220	You hear some noises in the bathtub.
3147220	3150740	Ooh, like water sloshing or something else?
3150740	3152900	You see, yes, at the surface,
3152900	3155560	a little bit of bubbling coming up
3155560	3157340	and the water's moving slightly.
3157340	3158580	I called it, Jody.
3158580	3161540	Did you notice this and I'm just pointing at the bubbles?
3162220	3167220	Uh, Cindy, you guys wanna come take a look
3170300	3171780	at this real quick?
3171780	3175940	Cindy and Tanner are distracting Riker
3175940	3178500	outside of both of these rooms.
3178500	3181640	Yeah, we're really excited to try the Megaduce.
3181640	3182480	Yeah.
3182480	3184300	Everyone keeps telling us to go there.
3184300	3187860	Well, what would you suggest that I order?
3187860	3189900	Also don't breathe in through your nose.
3189900	3192140	Jody and Ashley, he busts out the door.
3192140	3195060	He says to Riker, strange question, maybe.
3195060	3199340	You got a fishnet, a big fishnet, small fishnet.
3199340	3200660	No, you know anybody with-
3200660	3203340	I got toilet plunger.
3208260	3211360	Can you bring me a fitted sheet?
3211360	3213580	Okay, goes and gets you a fitted sheet.
3213580	3214420	What's going on in there?
3214420	3216660	Yeah, why a fitted sheet or a big net?
3216660	3218100	Can we cut to the bathroom real quick?
3218100	3220020	Harlan's still in there and I wanna see
3220020	3222380	if the plug in the tub, is it a pull out?
3222380	3223500	You have to reach in your hand in the water
3223500	3227540	to pull it out or do you have to hit the switch on the side?
3227540	3228380	There's no switch.
3228380	3230640	So you have to press the button
3230640	3232740	to get the spring to trigger or pull it out.
3232740	3233580	It's one or the other.
3233580	3235220	But it's reaching into the water either way.
3235220	3236040	Yes.
3236040	3238320	Could I find something long like,
3238320	3239980	oh, can I pull the towel rack off?
3239980	3243020	Like just to undo that and I wanna use that
3243020	3246200	to push down on the thing to drain the tub.
3246200	3248180	What if the thing goes down the drain?
3248180	3250720	Ooh, that's why I wanted to like filter it out
3250720	3251560	with the sheet.
3251560	3253800	Yeah, I don't know.
3253800	3254640	I see.
3254640	3256680	Jodine, you looked initially at the body, right?
3256680	3257560	And you left.
3257560	3258400	Yes.
3258400	3260240	And then you came back in with Harlan?
3260240	3261080	Yes.
3261080	3262240	Give me an alertness roll.
3263960	3264940	11, a crit.
3264940	3267800	With an 11, you notice something is different
3267800	3269500	than when you were first in the room.
3269500	3272000	And what's different was it looked initially
3272000	3276240	like he had some sort of like large pimple
3276240	3279520	or growth or something on his head,
3279520	3281440	kind of right on his forehead.
3281440	3286000	No hair on it, but it was like a growth on his skull.
3286000	3288520	By the time you come back, it's gone.
3289360	3292000	Harlan, step back.
3292000	3293280	Get out of this bathroom.
3293280	3297300	Harlan is holding the towel rack about to hit the thing.
3297300	3301240	You hear from inside the pipes underneath the bathtub,
3301240	3306240	bang, bang, bang, up against the stopper,
3307020	3310040	something coming up from inside the pipes,
3310040	3314640	going up into the bathtub, bang, bang.
3314640	3315460	What do you do?
3320760	3321840	Holy shit.
3322760	3324920	If this is like fight, flight or freeze,
3324920	3326040	we all just froze.
3326800	3327640	Yeah.
3329480	3331280	As you're standing there,
3331280	3335160	eventually the clanging pushes through,
3335160	3339440	the stopper bust out in this almost metallic looking liquid
3339440	3342560	starts pouring up through the bloody water.
3342560	3345660	So it starts cascading up into the ceiling,
3345660	3347900	spraying bloody water everywhere.
3347900	3351560	And then this metallic substance starts spraying
3351560	3352640	all over the room.
3353280	3354120	Oh my God.
3355400	3359160	Those of you in the room, give me a Dodge.
3361440	3362580	It's the Terminator.
3364800	3365800	Holy shit.
3365800	3366620	A one.
3366620	3367600	I rolled a one.
3367600	3369720	And I rolled a six on a 50.
3369720	3371240	Oh, all right.
3371240	3373060	So with both of those,
3373060	3376260	you're able to just back out really quickly
3376260	3377640	out of the bathroom,
3377640	3380120	not getting wet from any of the either bloody water
3380120	3381560	or this metallic stuff,
3381600	3386360	but it sprays up as a geyser and then falls back down.
3386360	3389200	And it's kind of mixed into this bloody water
3389200	3390720	as the tub is draining.
3390720	3393800	And everything that's sprayed up onto the walls and ceiling
3393800	3396280	kind of conjoins together,
3396280	3399200	almost like, you know, mercury beating together
3399200	3400580	and starts going back,
3400580	3402320	joining the rest of the stuff in the tub
3402320	3404880	and starts swirling down the drain.
3404880	3406560	Should we try to collect some?
3406560	3407400	I don't know.
3407400	3410040	I was not prepared for anything like this.
3410040	3411180	Mr. Winners?
3412480	3414560	Mr. Winners, I know it's the end of class,
3414560	3416840	but you forgot to collect our homework.
3418040	3419100	I don't want to be that guy,
3419100	3423440	but can these guys roll a fucking sanity check?
3423440	3424440	Oh yeah, shit.
3426800	3429060	Yes, they most definitely can.
3429060	3431200	Also, I have to pee so bad.
3432880	3434320	Are we close to pee time?
3434320	3435160	Yes, we are.
3435160	3435980	That's a fail.
3435980	3437600	Fail for me.
3437600	3438960	Oh no.
3439000	3440440	Oh yes.
3440440	3442640	Oh yeah.
3442640	3444600	Take four sanity damage each.
3448560	3449400	We got it.
3449400	3452220	Sorry, I was just, I was very much in the mood.
3453160	3454320	Make them roll again.
3454320	3455760	Do it, make them do it again.
3457200	3459400	Oh, just wait till you two search room 11.
3461560	3464400	Is it five for like temporary insanity?
3464400	3465240	Yeah.
3465240	3466280	Okay.
3466280	3467100	Yep.
3467100	3468440	You should have made it five.
3469640	3474640	So a little bit of sanity damage,
3475000	3480000	but you're not wet from the metallic oozy stuff.
3480160	3481680	Yeah, I think that probably would have been a day
3481680	3482680	for you and me, Joe.
3486000	3489040	What do you do though as it's swirling down the drain?
3489040	3490080	Yeah, I don't know.
3491160	3496160	Joe Dean grabs one of like a cup from the fast food debris,
3496600	3499400	a Wendy's cup or some shit, whatever's there.
3499400	3502880	And he just tries to grab a drop that's falling down
3502880	3505400	from the ceiling and like catch it in the cup.
3505400	3506800	He catches it.
3506800	3511800	It recognizes its path almost was obstructed.
3511860	3516080	It rapidly expands from being just a couple drops in size,
3516080	3521080	outward, super flat, super wide, shattering the cup.
3521480	3524160	And then the glass and liquid falls back into the tub.
3524520	3528320	Joe Dean like drops it as it shatters in his hands,
3529440	3531640	walks out of the bathroom and closes the door.
3532600	3535920	Thomas's eyes were so big as you were describing that.
3539920	3542780	Keep Rekker out of here.
3542780	3545360	Rekker, I go outside and I'm gonna say Rekker,
3545360	3546700	this was not the right fitted sheet.
3546700	3548640	Like why don't you, can we go,
3548640	3550600	we needed something different.
3550600	3552200	Maybe I don't know what a fitted sheet is.
3552200	3553900	Could you just bring back a lot of things
3554500	3555920	from like the deepest part of your linen closet?
3555920	3557060	Oh, sure, sure.
3557060	3559380	Maybe crack open room 12 real quick.
3559380	3562180	That way we can do a safety check in there before you go.
3562180	3563780	Oh, 11, I think, but yeah.
3563780	3565340	12, if you have it.
3565340	3568240	Yeah, you can just leave us that key if that's all right.
3568240	3570480	We really do need those linens quite quickly.
3570480	3571320	I'll unlock it.
3571320	3572620	You can open it when you need it.
3572620	3573960	Okay, thank you.
3573960	3574900	He jets off.
3574900	3576240	Nice guy.
3576240	3580700	Yeah, he has one of the most prestigious jobs in town.
3580740	3583820	He's managing a 11 room motel.
3584780	3586840	Big time for Merle, the richest man in town.
3586840	3587740	Yeah.
3587740	3588740	Exactly.
3588740	3589940	By this time though,
3589940	3593400	you can reason that the entire tub is drained.
3594300	3596240	Now you have this room with a computer,
3596240	3599940	some journals, and also room 11.
3599940	3601920	Now the other thing that you can't see on the map
3601920	3603020	that I didn't mention,
3603020	3605980	there's actually a door inside of this room
3605980	3609460	conjoining room 10 and 11 as well.
3609660	3611660	You can also try to go into room 11.
3611660	3613180	There's a mech in that one closet.
3613180	3618180	Well, when Riker lets us into room 11,
3618300	3620420	Tanner and Cindy will go in there.
3620420	3621260	Yeah.
3621260	3622080	Into room 11?
3622080	3622920	Yeah.
3622920	3624500	Okay, you crack open the door,
3624500	3626940	you see a second motel room.
3626940	3628940	This one in much better condition.
3628940	3631120	However, you do see it's been lived in.
3631120	3633260	This is not in fact a room for storage.
3633260	3636460	There is clothing, a couple of suitcases,
3636460	3641460	and there is a young girl curled up in the fetal position
3642780	3647380	in the corner of the room silently up against the wall
3647380	3651340	listening to what was happening in Scott Adams's room.
3651340	3652940	Jane?
3652940	3653780	Jane?
3655100	3655940	Yeah?
3658860	3660060	Holy shit.
3660060	3661860	Thank God that you're safe.
3661860	3664420	And Cindy is gonna walk up,
3664420	3667740	pull a second cardigan out of her purse
3667740	3672320	and go to wrap it around the back of this poor girl.
3672320	3676860	And Cindy's being real soft, taking a real gentle approach.
3676860	3681780	Dear, can you tell us at all what happened?
3681780	3684160	I disappeared.
3684160	3685000	Yeah.
3685000	3689820	And, yeah, and something happened to me.
3689820	3691660	It was three weeks ago.
3691660	3692500	Okay.
3692500	3696020	And as she stands up, you look at her.
3696020	3699460	She is about six months pregnant.
3701300	3703020	Oh, shit.
3703020	3705140	Jane, Jane, how long?
3705140	3706820	You said you disappeared three weeks.
3706820	3708340	How long were you gone?
3709560	3710780	A couple of hours.
3710780	3714760	Jane, I have a really strange question to ask you.
3714760	3718700	And I want you to just be very serious.
3718700	3721940	Take it calm, okay?
3722220	3724600	How long have you been pregnant?
3726100	3727860	That's the thing.
3727860	3728700	Yeah.
3730740	3734060	Maybe a month?
3734060	3735380	Yeah.
3735380	3737020	Is it Billy's?
3737020	3737900	Yes.
3738900	3739740	Okay.
3740700	3743140	Do you remember the lights?
3743140	3743980	Yes.
3744820	3747500	Do you remember any sounds?
3747500	3748860	No, no.
3748860	3750260	Any smells?
3750260	3751560	They put things in me.
3752080	3754080	Yeah, I want to look at her arms.
3754080	3757960	Well, actually, you don't see anything on her arms.
3757960	3759160	What about her belly?
3759160	3760000	Yeah.
3760000	3762760	So you'll find those same kind of incisions
3762760	3765000	all on her lower abdomen.
3765900	3768680	She is just wearing a t-shirt inside.
3768680	3771320	Another thing you'll notice in this room,
3771320	3773600	there are food containers galore.
3773600	3775340	Compared to Scott Adams' room,
3775340	3778240	there are 10 times as many food containers.
3778240	3781080	Any prescription, I assume?
3781520	3782360	No pain meds.
3782360	3783180	Tylenol?
3783180	3784160	No.
3784160	3786860	Doesn't seem like the muscle thing happened to her.
3786860	3788480	You're one of those weak people
3788480	3792520	who relies on pain medication, aren't you, Tan?
3792520	3796040	Very odd way to phrase that, but yeah.
3796040	3797480	Will you give this girl some?
3797480	3798920	She's pregnant, I don't know if you're supposed to take that.
3798920	3800760	Just ibuprofen, I don't know.
3800760	3803320	I don't know much about pregnancy.
3803320	3805380	You can roll medicine for me.
3805380	3807160	Oh wait, none of you took medicine.
3807160	3811600	How about this, I'll roll anyway.
3811600	3813260	David's like, it's about drugs,
3813260	3816600	and we're like, none of us will have the medicine skill.
3816600	3817440	How about that?
3817440	3820180	Yeah, it's not a crit fail, just a regular fail.
3820180	3821020	Nice.
3821020	3822800	You think it's fine.
3822800	3827800	Hey, Cindy, I think we found our alien.
3828080	3830400	Yeah, I think you're right.
3830400	3833280	Jane, your mother is worried sick about you.
3833280	3834560	I don't wanna see her.
3834560	3836720	She can't see me like this.
3837240	3839280	They're gonna be so disappointed in me.
3839280	3841680	I don't know if they have the capacity for that.
3842920	3845480	I just don't wanna see them.
3845480	3848600	That's why I contacted Mr. Adams.
3848600	3852640	Yeah, tell us, what's your relationship with Mr. Adams?
3852640	3853740	Just needed help.
3853740	3855000	What kind of help were you looking for?
3855000	3856720	What could he offer you?
3856720	3860160	Something to explain what happened to me,
3860160	3862020	the lights and everything.
3863020	3868020	And he was in town and asking about aliens and stuff,
3868300	3870100	and I thought maybe that would be it.
3870100	3873740	I don't know, but he paid for this room.
3873740	3875460	He was bringing me food.
3875460	3878340	Did he help with anything else?
3878340	3880920	No, he just, he was keeping me safe.
3880920	3885780	He was gonna take me to Nashville to see a doctor.
3885780	3887620	He said, it's not safe here in town,
3887620	3889100	and I have to go elsewhere.
3889100	3891620	And when was the last time you saw him?
3891620	3892860	I talked to him.
3892860	3896060	Yesterday morning, he was supposed to bring me food,
3896060	3897900	and I'm getting so hungry.
3897900	3900060	So you didn't go next door?
3900060	3902820	No, he told me to keep a low profile.
3902820	3905700	And what did you do with him the day before that?
3905700	3907620	He just told me to stay here.
3907620	3909880	He said he was researching the town,
3909880	3912700	and once he had enough evidence,
3912700	3915340	we were gonna leave and go to Nashville.
3915340	3918260	Did you guys physically touch?
3918260	3919680	Did you shake his hand?
3919680	3921420	Did you high-five him?
3922060	3925220	He might've put his hand on my shoulder at some point,
3925220	3927620	but I think maybe that's it.
3927620	3929460	I don't know.
3929460	3931940	I'm so hungry and scared.
3931940	3933740	Well, we'll get you some food, okay?
3935260	3936400	Okay.
3936400	3938340	Now you can all roll me a sanity.
3938340	3939180	Yeah.
3939180	3943920	Having seen this young girl who is four weeks pregnant,
3943920	3947020	but showing the signs of being around six months pregnant,
3947020	3947860	seven months pregnant.
3947860	3948780	Yeah, it's a fail.
3948780	3950280	I had to fail for me as well.
3952060	3953540	Three sanity damage.
3955260	3957360	I am down to 44.
3958300	3959900	I am down to 46.
3959900	3961100	Ooh.
3961100	3962860	Breaking point, 43.
3962860	3964500	I'm at 36.
3964500	3966420	I'm at a 45.
3966420	3967740	Tanner feels sick,
3967740	3972740	and he's just like Luke is not sure what to do next.
3972820	3975100	Would we be able to say that in this time
3975100	3976140	that they've been talking to her,
3976140	3979820	that Jodine and Harlan have gone through the papers
3979860	3981900	for Harlan and the computer for Jodine?
3983040	3985140	Fact, we would be able to.
3985140	3985980	Sweet.
3985980	3987540	Let's go through the paper first.
3987540	3990340	Would there also be cool information in there
3990340	3992140	that they could learn that would be cool enough
3992140	3993420	to end an episode on?
3993420	3995000	Dude, I have to be so fast.
3995000	3995980	Yep, right here.
3995980	3996820	Sick.
3996820	3998820	Yeah, you got any real prizes in there?
3998820	3999980	It's in front of you.
3999980	4001400	Read off some of it.
4001400	4002240	Oh, shit.
4002240	4003060	Be surprised.
4003060	4003900	Gotcha.
4003900	4008380	We've got a listing of number of livestock mutilations here.
4008460	4011820	There were three cows, a goat, and 20 chickens.
4011820	4014820	There's also livestock alterations.
4014820	4017840	A cow was missing an udder, but otherwise in good health.
4019020	4022180	Spotted three more in a roadside survey.
4023040	4024740	Didn't know who the farmer was.
4024740	4027080	We've also got accounts of missing time,
4027940	4031620	chopper sightings, lights.
4031620	4034100	Everyone's seen some, it says.
4034100	4037780	Allen, Barn, Thomas, Jacobs, Cartwright, and Anderson
4037780	4039420	never go home.
4039420	4040440	Never go home.
4041460	4044080	Do we know any of those names besides Allen?
4044080	4047400	Barn is Merle.
4047400	4050140	Cartwright is the family from Bonanza.
4050140	4050980	Yep.
4050980	4051800	And also.
4051800	4053640	Those are all the aldermen.
4053640	4056380	You would have seen their names on offices.
4056380	4057540	When we were in the courthouse,
4057540	4058500	we would have seen their names.
4058500	4060980	Yeah, so Jane's dad, Merle Barn,
4060980	4063020	and then you would have seen the other names too.
4063020	4065180	Oh, this is, we did know.
4065220	4068380	That's not like some ominous, mysterious thing.
4068380	4069700	We knew he wasn't going home.
4069700	4071260	Right, but never go home.
4071260	4072100	Exactly.
4072100	4074260	But I thought it was like,
4074260	4077340	Scott Adams knows they'll never go home.
4078940	4080380	Their story ends here.
4080380	4084380	["I Gotta Work In The Morning"]
4091580	4096180	I gotta work in the morning
4096180	4099100	And this shit's so important
4099100	4103100	So I can't get high
4103100	4109100	No, I can't get high
4109140	4113420	I thought this stuff helped anxiety
4113420	4116620	It must be something inside of me
4116620	4120740	Does anybody know why?
4120740	4125740	I can't get high
4126220	4129740	I can't sit though I can
4129740	4134740	And I don't wanna try

4138740	4143500	Something more can be bought
4143500	4147500	Where do you begin?
4147500	4152500	I don't know how
4152500	4156500	Hallucination's so big-time, but
4156500	4160500	Spider's out the line
4161260	4165260	Breathing
4165260	4167260	I'm breathing
4167260	4173260	I've been hiding in low, low places
4173260	4175260	With some funny-looking dudes
4175260	4177260	With some fucked-up faces
4177260	4180260	And I can't help but feel it
4180260	4183260	I'll always be at the bottom
4191260	4195260	["I Gotta Work In The Morning"]
4202260	4207260	I think I'm allergic or something
4207260	4210260	Better go on with nothing
4210260	4214260	So I won't get high
4214260	4219260	No, I won't get high
4221260	4225260	By all means, do it if it helps
4225260	4228260	For me, it makes my brain melt
4228260	4232260	Does anybody know why?
4232260	4237260	I can't get high
