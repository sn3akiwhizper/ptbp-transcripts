0	7540	Hey all you cool dogs and puppas, it's your best friend Oh Wharf the dog, and I am here
7540	14940	to receive all the belly rubs live on 694.2 PTBP.
14940	21700	If you rub my tummy, make sure you wear some kind of gloves that you can dispose of, because
21700	29500	otherwise you will obtain a scent on you that you will never get rid of, and a stickiness
29500	30500	and ooze.
30500	35900	I've been told I have a superglue-like secretion.
35900	41280	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from at Mike Fardy, who tweeted about the show and tagged
41280	49400	that pretending pod they write, to Wolf the dog, from Mike Fardy and the Wonders and Blunders
49400	51060	podcast.
51060	56060	Dearest Wolf the dog, I can't hold back my feelings any longer.
56060	64860	Your gravely tones, your otherworldly fluting echoes, your got-dang thickness, may the light
64860	70820	of the blood moon guide you to me like I'm a dumpster full of night meat.
70820	77420	Much love from Wonders and Blunders, a fellow horror comedy actual play podcast, and good
77420	80100	luck to those contention boys.
80100	81780	End transmission.
81780	88860	Well, thanks Mike Fardy and the Wonders and Blunders podcast, but I am spoken for at the
88860	89860	moment.
89860	95980	There's a trash can named Teresa that I spend a lot of my time with these days.
95980	102100	She never asks for nothing, yet provides endless bounty for me and my loins.
102100	108820	But if me and Teresa ever break things off, which we never will, I will definitely keep
108820	111180	you in mind.
111180	113900	Maybe, but probably not.
113900	118020	There's a long list of suitors out there for little old Wolfie.
118020	122580	Remember, if you want to holla at your old wolf, use the screen you're already staring
122580	127300	at half the day and put something nasty out in the world with a tag for your dirtiest
127300	134740	dog at pretending pod, or write a review on Apple podcasts and tag us in the proof.
134740	140340	That's the goodest, and speaking of having nice things, you can find more tasty content
140340	147500	to devour in these less than delicious times over at patreon.com slash pretending pod.
147500	148820	And one more thing.
148820	155100	If you've listened this far, you very likely know about the subreddit and discord communities,
155100	160300	but I just want to say from the bottom of my stinky, greasy heart, it's a joy to watch
160300	167540	these internet nooks and crannies blossom into havens of silly and supportive solidarity.
167540	176700	Now time to get serious, because this episode is so, so very serious, seriously.
176700	182540	Now listen here you, I can't speak too loudly about this, but I heard this episode is not
182540	184140	very serious.
184140	189260	Seems like the producer was worried about becoming accustomed to remote playing before
189260	193140	jumping back into the main story.
193140	199100	Now remember to sit in those questions on the subreddit named episode 74, which it will
199100	204080	clearly not be, as this right here is episode 74.
204080	208060	Now let's get serious, my dear sweet innocent pups.
208060	213660	By the time you hear the intro to this song for the second time ever, you will know the
213660	217300	fate of the golden retriever called Bean.
217300	226100	It's kudzu with no backbow.
247300	263220	Howdy folks, I just wanted to drop in real quick to say we recorded this episode to give
263220	269540	us more time to field questions for next week's plot talk, and also to give me more time to
269540	272260	prep for this upcoming story arc.
272260	276420	Now on top of that, I figured it wouldn't hurt to get some more practice in with this
276420	282060	whole remote recording thing before we jump back into the nitty gritty good stuff, especially
282060	285300	with the mishap last week with Thomas' gain controls.
285300	288760	Well don't worry, we fucked it up again.
288760	294440	This time Luke and Thomas had their audio sent crisp and clear to the zoom call, however
294440	299460	they accidentally recorded their tracks with their laptop microphones instead.
299460	305660	I have edited this session, and I believe it is quite listenable and even, dare I say,
305660	311980	enjoyable, but it is not up to our standards for audio quality, and so we are using this
311980	318580	as a learning opportunity, and we are adding another clearly overlooked but important task
318580	322060	to our pre-recording checklists.
322060	327820	Thank you, each of you, for listening and supporting this show, it means so, so much
327820	328820	to me.
329100	332460	Boy howdy, we'll get it next week I bet.
332460	334380	Everybody clap on four and eight.
334380	341520	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, wonderful.
341520	343820	Thank you all so much for coming here today.
343820	344820	You're welcome.
344820	349700	I miss our finest of eves, here on Pretending to be People.
349700	352460	How's everybody doing out there?
352460	355100	Doing about as good as you can hope, you know?
355100	356620	I'm doing alright.
356740	362580	Luke said he was hitting negative six, so he probably needs to turn his gain down.
362580	363580	Uh, hold on.
363580	364580	Tattle.
364580	367980	If I'm talking normal, I'm hitting like around 18 to 12.
367980	371980	That's where I was last, well yeah, that's where I am now I guess.
371980	373220	Where's your gain turned to?
373220	379100	Hey, if the gain was an island, what time is your gain turned to?
379100	380100	About one o'clock.
380100	382660	If your gain was an island, which was the face of the clock.
382660	384140	I think you're probably good, man.
384140	387260	If you have a sundial.
387260	390460	If you have a sundial.
390460	394780	Now if you have a sundial, brother.
394780	396580	This is my character, by the way.
396580	397580	Oh good.
397580	403080	You might not be able to tell time on a foggy day.
403080	407580	So let's get right into this, because it's already nighttime.
407580	411220	The sun has been down for a minute at this point.
411220	415180	The premise that I sent you all.
415180	417620	I think we got it this time.
417620	418620	I hope so.
418620	419620	Maybe.
419620	424620	I'll go ahead and hit record now.
424620	425620	Is this recording?
425620	426620	Speed.
426620	427620	Fuck.
427620	435380	Um, the premise that I sent you all for tonight's recording session is as follows.
435380	439620	You all choose an animal you'd like to be.
439620	443860	Bean was a revered member of the Contention Critter Coalition.
443860	449020	The leader, a wise squirrel, is calling out to those who have survived by joining the
449020	453140	newly founded Contention Creek Critter Coalition.
453140	458100	They need the most highly trained, well-balanced strike team ever assembled to go on a near
458100	465980	suicide mission to save Bean, the most thoughtful and caring creature in the whole coalition.
465980	473260	And to pull off this rescue, you'll have to avoid the black goo and some humans too.
473260	475980	First thoughts when you read that.
475980	476980	And don't be mean.
476980	477980	Ooh, boy!
477980	481580	No, Zach, but what's the real scenario we're doing?
481580	483420	Yeah, be serious.
483420	487260	Oh, there's like dead kids or something?
487260	488260	Good.
488260	489260	That's bad.
489260	492340	Oh, their bodies are filled with maggots and shit?
492340	494340	No, no, I do want to-
494340	495340	No, actual shit.
495700	498700	I do want to say everybody's body is filled with actual shit.
498700	500620	That's where shit comes from.
500620	506020	Have you read the famous book, Everybody Shits?
506020	507260	Near suicide mission.
507260	512140	It better be a near suicide mission because like we talked about on the Q&A episode, if
512140	517860	any of these animals die, we will hold you personally responsible.
517860	521460	If my character dies, I will destroy the podcast.
521460	522800	Yeah, I quit.
522800	524660	I quit if any of these animals die.
524980	529620	On your character sheet, under equipment, does it say plot armor?
529620	530620	Yes.
530620	531620	Yeah.
531620	532940	You told us all that.
532940	536500	It says I'm a cute animal and it would fucking suck.
536500	538340	It would be bad podcast.
538340	542980	It would be bad radio if you killed a bunch of animals.
542980	543980	You can do anything to-
543980	548940	I'm going to report you to PETA right now.
548940	550940	What if you do, though, die?
550940	552940	Let's just try not to die.
553940	560780	I think as soon as you start thinking about how you're going to describe an animal dying
560780	568420	violently, you'll realize that you shouldn't be doing that on air and you will-
568420	570300	Well, we'll see.
570300	574700	We will see how my opinions of children versus animals-
574700	575700	Oh my gosh.
575700	577420	Okay, I'm changing my character.
577420	579420	It's a cat named Ramona.
583500	586340	If I were crazy, then would you still-
586340	587340	That's my kryptonite.
591580	593740	I didn't want to keep singing.
593740	594740	Thank you.
594740	599740	All right, I'm going to hit record now.
599740	603420	Went ahead and backspaced on this recording.
603420	611620	It is a brisk December 5th here in contention, made all the more bleak by the necessity
611620	613220	of the water.
613220	619540	Numbed by the frigid waters or the cutting winds, this brutally arctic reality was far
619540	622140	greater than the alternative.
622140	627260	The contention critter coalition has made their home here in Coles Creek, the survivors
627260	631340	rebranding themselves as the contention critter- fuck.
631340	634300	The contention creek critter coalition.
634300	640660	Now are these animals who spell adorably wrong with Ks because then the first name is fucked
641220	642740	No, they're Cs.
642740	644180	It's always Cs, Thomas.
644180	647300	When there's three Cs in a row, it's Cs.
647300	650580	All my Cs are hard, dude.
650580	657860	They rebranded themselves as the contention creek critter coalition for accuracy and additional
657860	659380	alliteration.
659380	663860	The contention creek critter coalition has gathered to hear an announcement from its
663860	671860	esteemed leader and wisest member, the old grey squirrel called Stallone.
673860	676900	We are in an unprecedented time.
676900	680180	Look around, look at what's left of us.
680180	684340	Tired, empty, shivering, the enemy.
684340	692100	And they point to both banks of Coles Creek where masses of writhing black ooze sloppily
692180	698660	spill back and forth, attempting to nip at any animals near to the shore, but consistently
698660	702100	careful enough to avoid falling into the water.
702100	710580	The enemy is unknown, but its effect has a lasting effect on the memory.
710580	716420	Few here have survived without witnessing at least one close companion consumed by this
716420	718100	unspeakable foe.
718100	726180	But I hold high hopeful hearsay, our admirable, admirable and astonishingly astute ally, the
726180	732980	golden retriever called Bean is still alive, though he is trapped.
733620	737940	His person has continued to leave him locked in isolation.
737940	741940	The wish should be clear to everyone now that water is life.
742900	747380	Who among you are brave enough to take on this task?
747940	754820	To liberate Bean from his prison of a pin at Hotel Motel.
755540	762180	I volunteer and you see an old dog named Rusty.
762820	769620	He's not as fast or strong as he used to be, but he's still a big, good boy.
770500	774660	And I think he's probably been something of like a community organizer in these trying
774660	775380	times.
775380	777140	I will go find Beans.
777140	778420	Who is with me?
778420	781220	Well, if he's in, then I'm gonna be in.
781220	786900	And a woodpecker comes and lands on him and raises a wing up.
788740	791620	What do people know about this woodpecker?
791620	798180	Wilson the woodpecker, just a friendly guy about the coalition, almost like a like a
798180	806580	pigeon because he can carry messages between the creators of the coalition and he can understand
806580	809220	humans so he can feed them info.
809220	814820	So right off the bat, Stallone is like, Rusty and Wilson.
814820	816740	Yes, yes, of course.
816740	818500	Two of our finest.
818500	820020	And who else?
820020	823860	Who is willing to join these two brave souls?
825140	825700	Did you say Beans?
826820	828020	It's Bean that we're going after?
828660	831140	I'm in, I'm in.
831140	832580	I know Beans.
832580	834660	He's an old friend of mine.
835460	835940	Oh boy.
839380	842260	That characterization was great, but we were getting a lot of...
844580	846820	So what do we know about this character?
846820	848660	What do the other animals know?
848660	849940	And what is this name?
850980	854820	This is Tyler, and he's a black lab.
855380	860660	And he recently escaped his master, and he's on the run.
861700	866020	I don't want to interrupt our flow, but Joe, you're breaking up like crazy.
866580	867460	At least for me.
867460	869140	I don't know what to do about that.
869140	871540	Yeah, as long as it's not recording that way.
871540	874100	Okay, so that's our second dog.
874100	875780	Thomas, what kind of dog were you?
875780	876980	I didn't catch that.
876980	878020	Rusty is a mutt.
878100	882740	He's based off a dog I used to live with.
882740	887860	One of my roommate's dogs that she had fostered and then adopted.
888500	891780	He was a sweet, big old boy named Dracula.
894420	895700	Excellent name for a dog.
896260	902580	And he was just a big gray, maybe like a shepherd lab mix.
902580	903460	A big gray.
903460	905700	A very old boy, a very sweet boy.
906340	909060	Inky bones, but a lot of heart.
911140	912980	My achy, breaky heart.
912980	915300	Tyler's a black lab, is that what you said?
915300	916500	Yep, that is correct.
917860	919700	And who is Tyler's owner?
921540	922180	I'll just say it.
922180	925060	It's Kerry pages from like our second episode.
925060	926900	Clark was tasked with finding this dog.
928500	931540	We thought it was fitting that Joe would play said dog.
932500	936660	And Justin, a coward or are you taking this for spot?
936660	940180	I'm taking this for a spot out of the shadows.
940180	941620	Yeah, I'm just like, no, I'm not playing.
941620	942900	I'm just going to hang out with you guys.
944100	944820	I'm just watching.
944820	946580	Kind of undermine Zach.
947220	951940	I just go back to Justin every 15 minutes to describe how cold the water is.
953060	956260	Yeah, he is an animal, but he just stays behind.
956260	957380	Yeah, I'm playing a character.
957380	958820	He's comfortable.
959380	960180	He's hanging out.
960660	968260	Uh, no, out of, out of the shadows steps, uh, a very small, but proud creature.
968980	970180	It's a little chipmunk.
971300	975060	Hey, I think y'all are going to need some leadership for this today.
975620	976820	I'm chip Montgomery.
976820	977620	Y'all know me.
978260	979460	Y'all know me really well.
980020	982100	Should have been president, but that's okay.
982100	984020	Some peoples ain't meant for leadership.
984660	989860	You may have gotten the majority vote, but I won in the electoral college.
990420	991060	Yeah, we know.
991060	993620	We know it's bullshit, but I'm here.
993620	998180	Cause y'all seem like you could use an old hand besides old rusty here.
998180	999220	My days are numbered.
999220	1002340	Anyway, I don't think chipmunks are long for this world.
1002340	1007700	I did assume rusty might take some sort of leadership role, but he could also be more
1007700	1012900	of a spiritual, uh, counsel, uh, chip.
1012900	1015140	Montgomery has obviously seen some shit.
1015700	1016740	He's quite fat.
1016740	1024340	Now his, uh, chipmunk for his grade over time, quite elderly, but still spry and full
1024340	1024980	of sass.
1025780	1027540	You're just rusty, but a chipmunk.
1028980	1029380	Maybe.
1033140	1039860	And as the four of you joined together, um, you try to figure out what differentiates
1039860	1047540	chip from rusty as looming in the background is this ooze that just kind of like follows
1047540	1053060	you, like mirrors your movements as, as you've grouped together up front near this, uh, this
1053060	1054580	elderly gray squirrel.
1055220	1062580	And he says to you, the first thing that you must do in front of everyone is figure out
1062580	1064260	how to get out of this Creek.
1064260	1070180	The black goo is everywhere and he watches, he watches our movements and he wants us.
1070180	1072100	Does the black goo have a smell?
1072100	1076180	Like what a dog who's, okay.
1076180	1078660	Well, I think we, we gotta get water on it, right?
1078660	1079780	How would animals do that?
1080820	1082420	Let's talk like we're animals.
1082420	1084020	You could get wet and shake it all.
1084980	1085380	Yeah.
1085380	1092660	Rusty, uh, rusty rolls around in the Creek, uh, and then stands right by the bed and gives
1092660	1097460	it a big old dog shake and just flashes water everywhere.
1097460	1099860	And does the, does the goo flee from the water?
1099860	1100660	Oh, absolutely.
1100660	1101140	It does.
1101140	1102900	Then Tyler's going to follow suit.
1102900	1104180	That looks like it works.
1104180	1109140	Chip Montgomery gets a little tiny like cap off of like a little nut and fills it with
1109140	1115460	water and tries to like fireman bucket on top of chip.
1115460	1117940	What I think you should do is hop on.
1117940	1122260	I think you shouldn't tell me what I'm supposed to be doing or not doing brother.
1123300	1128100	I, um, or at the end, I'm just, I'm just a spiritual counsel.
1128100	1133860	So this is just some sage advice, but, uh, perhaps you should hop on my back.
1133860	1141220	And because, because I'm, I'm pretty old and weak, perhaps if Tyler, who is spry and I
1141220	1142900	believe very good at jumping.
1142900	1143060	Yeah.
1143060	1143300	Yeah.
1143300	1144180	Come on, come on, get on the back.
1144180	1144660	Get on my back.
1144660	1145460	Come on, get on my back.
1145460	1147060	You can use my collar as a, as a brains.
1147060	1147460	Come on.
1147460	1148740	No, no, here's, here's what's up.
1149460	1152980	You shake, you shake and clear a path.
1152980	1157140	So these old bones can take me and me and chip.
1157140	1157780	Oh, okay.
1157780	1158180	Sure.
1158740	1160500	And then you leap over the goo.
1160500	1160980	You got it.
1160980	1161860	And I do it.
1161860	1163300	I like take off.
1163300	1168020	I got my, I got my mission and I'm, I'm soaking down, wiggling out some water.
1168020	1172660	And if I can get to a point, is there a path out of this goo or is it, does it cover the
1172660	1173060	land?
1173060	1176020	I mean, is there, is there a space that this, oh yeah.
1176020	1181700	So it's just, it is formed lines near the land just far enough, like a far apart from
1181700	1182340	each other.
1182340	1187460	Like the lines, like at the, like, if you're like heading to the paint in basketball, you
1187460	1188580	got those lines.
1188580	1189860	Did that make any sense?
1189860	1191140	Am I making any sense?
1192100	1196420	So like six feet in between chunks of black goo and then past that.
1196420	1197700	Yeah, no, it's free land.
1197700	1204020	They are clearly, they want to consume, but they cannot get into the water.
1204020	1204580	Gotcha.
1204580	1207140	But an athletic dog could definitely clear the gap.
1207700	1208740	Oh, Tyler?
1211060	1213380	Are we talking about Tyler right now?
1213380	1217940	Also, Luke's just a bird, so he kind of put the screws to your whole game, Zach.
1219060	1220420	I fly over.
1220420	1220920	Yeah.
1222260	1227220	I actually had this idea in my mind when I was coming up with this, that the birds would
1227220	1233460	be like in a different group, like in a different gang that's not affected, like the privileged.
1233540	1237460	They still could be, but like Willie's just cool enough that he transcends clicks.
1237460	1243780	Yeah, I think Willie should let me ride on him because the imagery is very cool.
1250100	1252020	What is the Wilson, the woodpecker doing?
1252020	1256260	I fly over the goo and I'm like, okay, I'll be waiting over here for you guys.
1256260	1257220	Tyler's running.
1257220	1261620	If he can, if he can clear the path with one swoop, he would just run out there, shaggy,
1261620	1264980	shaggy dog it, and then there'd be a little path there that they can follow.
1264980	1267940	Otherwise he's running back and forth, getting more water on his body,
1267940	1270740	clearing a little bit more, coming back, clearing a little bit more.
1270740	1275940	Let's see if you need to be saved while you're being the hero by having you roll here.
1275940	1282900	So basically in order to fully get out of this mess, you're going to have to roll either
1282900	1287060	one of your special skills or dexterity, probably.
1287060	1288900	I've got a special skill of jumping.
1288900	1290180	He's a really good jumper.
1290180	1291380	He can leap over fences.
1291380	1293380	That's how he got out of his last yard.
1293380	1293620	Yeah.
1293620	1299860	So real quick explanation for how we're doing mechanics for this little one shot here.
1299860	1306660	We're using the six stats from Delta Green, which are somebody else, please.
1306660	1312500	There's strength, constitution, power, intelligence, dexterity, and charisma.
1312500	1318100	And I gave them the points of 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70.
1318100	1318420	Yep.
1318420	1320980	For those six, they got to put those wherever they wanted.
1320980	1327700	And then I said you guys could have two special abilities that would both be at 75%.
1328820	1332500	And I guess we'll figure out what those are as we play the game.
1332500	1335460	One of Joe's for Tyler is jumping.
1336180	1337620	So go ahead and roll, baby.
1341460	1343620	I pass a 40 on a 75.
1343620	1346180	40 on a 75 success.
1346180	1352260	So as you fully pushed through this barricade of black goo,
1352260	1356020	you can get rusty and chip up and through.
1356020	1361540	Like if this was red Rover, you know, you would have came all over past.
1362660	1363060	Jesus.
1364980	1366260	That's how that game is played.
1369540	1371060	And you broke the barricade.
1371060	1372740	You were red rocket.
1376740	1379700	Red rocket, red rocket.
1379700	1380580	I'm coming on.
1382820	1384260	And no one can stop me.
1385860	1386820	Oh boy.
1386820	1387780	We're in the Creek now.
1390180	1394260	And bounding over you've hit the main, uh, the main roadway
1394260	1396660	and contention that leads from the highway down.
1396660	1401860	You might not know this, uh, depending on how, uh, well-versed you guys are,
1401860	1404660	but you do know where hotel motel is.
1404660	1408820	As you have hung out with being a fair few times in the parking lot,
1408820	1413060	where he hosts, uh, anyone and everyone who just wants to come and chill
1413060	1414580	and have like a great time.
1414580	1420580	As long as his person remembers to leave the door unlocked for him.
1420580	1425460	So as you guys are crossing, I need, uh, let's see, how about I roll?
1425460	1431140	Um, I'm going to roll a D4 to see, uh, which one of you this affects.
1432100	1434660	And hopefully it's not Thomas.
1435380	1436660	Uh, let's see.
1436660	1438820	We'll do one is Luke.
1438820	1439700	Two is Justin.
1439700	1440100	I'm here.
1440100	1441140	I'm just grabbing my guys.
1442180	1443860	Three is Thomas.
1443860	1445940	And four is Joe.
1445940	1447300	And this D4 says.
1449940	1454500	One Wilson, the woodpecker.
1454500	1456500	It's not a good thing as the four of you.
1459140	1460020	As the four of you.
1460020	1462820	I was deciding which one of your characters is really racist.
1466500	1468980	I would never make that kind of choice for you.
1468980	1469620	First off.
1470900	1472420	I would let you dig your own grip.
1472980	1473620	It's ironic.
1473620	1476500	And then promptly knock you straight off the podcast.
1476500	1482340	Luke, uh, you've got, uh, as Wilson, the woodpecker.
1482340	1486180	Are you flying or are you, uh, how, what is your mode of transport here?
1486180	1488020	Uh, am I in the group with them?
1488020	1489380	Like we're all together now?
1489380	1495300	Yeah, you've made it past the goo and the, uh, as you guys, as you guys rush through
1495300	1503140	this line and make it through with the intense, uh, bouts of jumping and dexterity and just
1503140	1508900	really a lot of, um, a lot of flair as you guys jump through this area.
1508900	1514580	It's almost like, uh, like a horse, uh, jumping through a hoop made of fire is
1514580	1520020	essentially what everyone else sees who is in the CCCC who's in this Creek.
1520020	1524740	And they all start cheering and chanting with lots of hurrahs and yippees.
1524740	1526580	And I knew they could do it.
1526580	1529140	Um, from the animals in the.
1529700	1532820	Essentially crowd at this point, watching you guys work your magic.
1532820	1535860	Rusty waxes down while they're doing that.
1535860	1539780	I'm on the other side of the goo and I'm eating a worm that I found on the ground.
1539780	1545380	Does the goo have sentience enough that it is chasing after us now that we've broken
1545380	1547860	its ranks or does it just chill by the Creek?
1547860	1552340	Still the goo is sticking behind, which you would know as because there's just, there's
1552340	1553620	more food there, right?
1553620	1558660	Even though the water is in between them and they can't get it there, they see, it sees
1558660	1562420	more that it can consume and therefore is distracted.
1562420	1567380	And the four of you make your way to the main drag of contention.
1567380	1573380	And you know that just on the other side of this drag is hotel motel, where the dopest
1573380	1576020	of dopes Bean resides.
1577140	1583060	As you approach this business highway, Wilson, are you in the air or are you on the ground?
1583060	1588820	In the air, but I'm like, uh, like on the ground critters level, like just like a foot
1588820	1590420	above, foot above the ground.
1590420	1597140	Up above you see, no, it, it can't be it's, I mean it is a possum, but it's not just
1597140	1597940	any possum.
1597940	1601620	It looks like it's, it's your friend.
1601620	1602740	It's common.
1602740	1605060	And he is laying on his back.
1605860	1611460	This adorable, adorable little possum that Wilson has known for years and years, just
1611460	1613300	right there on the side of the road.
1613300	1616580	I land and go over to him and like pick him.
1616580	1618820	I'm like, you do this all the time.
1618820	1619460	Come on, man.
1619460	1622260	Hey, what the fuck are you doing there, buddy?
1622260	1627540	You can't just come into me with your beak all like sharp and whatnots on me.
1627540	1629460	Why are you playing dead over here?
1629460	1634500	Well, you see, there was some of the mess coming through the area and heading on down
1634500	1636580	to y'all in the water.
1636580	1642740	And it don't find me nothing to be consuming for when I be laying on the backside.
1642740	1645300	Rusty sees a possum and starts barking.
1645300	1651380	Hey, why are you just barking when you could say words at me, friend?
1651380	1653620	Tyler starts barking because Rusty's barking.
1656900	1659060	Guys, this is, this is my friend Common.
1659060	1661300	He, uh, what are you doing here?
1661300	1668020	Well, I was making my way down to the water to hang out with you guys.
1668020	1673700	Cause I heard that you joined away from the birds, people who don't like me much no more
1673700	1675300	no way anyhow.
1675300	1681780	Well, we're on our way to, we're on our way to get bean, but, uh, you can go down to the
1681780	1683220	water if you want.
1683220	1684100	Yep, I do.
1684100	1685060	That was my plan.
1685060	1686260	And now I'm leaving.
1686260	1688420	Thanks for saying hi to all of you.
1688420	1690260	Thanks for barking at me and Chip.
1691620	1692980	I know what you did.
1692980	1693620	Wait a minute.
1694260	1696980	I don't think it's safe for him to be going down there alone.
1697540	1701460	You think a possum can clear whatever amount of slime is down there?
1701460	1709700	You think that looking out for my safety is worth repayment for what you did to my brother?
1709700	1710580	Chip, what'd you do to his brother?
1710580	1711300	What'd you do to his brother?
1711300	1712180	What'd you do to his brother?
1713060	1717300	I never liked no possum no how, and that's all I'll leave it at.
1717940	1719860	Well, first of all, possum is delicious.
1720580	1723380	Okay, now I'm really bailing on out of here.
1724420	1726500	Wilson, it's good to see you.
1726500	1728740	Weird crew you're running with these days.
1728900	1734180	Well, I heard Bean was in trouble, so I came down.
1734820	1740180	The birds are not too concerned with it, so I'm trying this group out to go get them.
1740180	1741940	You're a good man, Willie.
1741940	1745300	Could never trust no possum to be brave when it mattered none.
1746980	1749140	Ouch, that hurt my feelings.
1752500	1755060	I better go now before you seem to cry.
1755060	1760660	Back at Critter College, we called him O-Pussy.
1764820	1768260	He's a better man now that he's not in college anymore.
1769460	1770980	Well, see you later.
1772180	1776260	Bye, this has been a good encounter that definitely helped everyone a lot.
1776260	1779860	And as you guys pass over the road, you make it to the other side.
1781300	1783140	Did Colin have something to offer us?
1785060	1788420	Besides his next dope track?
1790340	1791300	No relation.
1793540	1795620	Was that my role on me?
1795620	1796180	That was it?
1797780	1801300	I mean, anything could have happened, but that's what happened.
1804020	1805780	So you guys make it over to the other side.
1805780	1807140	I'll go back and kill him if you want me to.
1810260	1812740	Rusty, yeah, I was like, I'd really love to eat that possum.
1815220	1818260	He's my friend, don't need him until he's actually dead.
1819140	1829620	In the distance, you see Hotel Motel with its dimly kind of lit sign, and the parking lot
1829620	1839380	is not full at all, and the exterior doors of this place hold as much residue as a sink
1839380	1843860	that is owned by a 19-year-old boy, or girl for that matter.
1843860	1846900	19-year-olds just don't clean their sinks very often.
1846900	1848020	Basically, they're grody.
1848020	1850980	It's grody doors all over the external of this place.
1852020	1858020	And this is Hotel Motel, where you know that Bean is in one of these motel rooms.
1858020	1859060	We've met Bean before?
1859060	1863620	Oh yeah, he's the dopest golden retriever this side of the Mississippi, baby.
1863620	1867620	All rest he can't see so well no more, but he can still hear,
1867620	1870740	and he can still smell like a son of a bitch, literally.
1871300	1877220	So he's gonna try to sniff out Bean.
1877220	1881460	Go ahead and roll for me, Rusty.
1881460	1882100	83.
1882740	1883460	There's too much.
1884660	1885380	He's confused.
1887060	1892660	He's like, I almost smell him, but there's too much in the air.
1892660	1894740	I can't get a bean on what room he's in.
1894740	1898180	You can't get a bean on him whatsoever,
1898180	1905140	but you do hear a bit of a warble in the air that's singing along the winds,
1905140	1905620	and it's like...
1910100	1912260	Does it sound like Bean to us?
1912260	1916260	It does not sound like Bean, but it does sound like a dog.
1918340	1921140	Yeah, so besides smelling, the other thing Rusty can do is hear,
1921140	1923060	so he'd like to focus in on that sound.
1924740	1927540	13.
1928740	1932260	You hear, through this distinct warble in the air,
1932260	1935300	a rich, clear voice come through that says,
1935860	1937700	Hello there to all.
1938980	1947060	My name is Murphy, and I would like someone to let me out of this room.
1949460	1952900	Zach, do not put my fucking dog in a locked hotel room.
1954740	1962500	I do love the cameo, but if you even fictitiously harm him.
1963780	1964340	Oopsie.
1967140	1968500	By the way, I'm dead.
1972500	1974020	I'm the ghost of your dog.
1976740	1982660	I sure would like a friend in these troubling times.
1982660	1983540	Fuck you.
1984420	1985860	Fellers, you know what that means.
1986580	1992420	Contention Creek Critter, coalition don't leave no dog or aminal behind.
1993940	1994580	Namaste.
1995140	1996020	Namaste, brother.
1998660	2003300	And you guys see that to the right, there is a little office
2003300	2008740	where there's a front door with an open sign that is well lit.
2009380	2010260	Well lit.
2010260	2012180	And a different door.
2012180	2020420	There is a man who is pushing a cart with cleaning supplies and fresh towels on it.
2020980	2022420	Don't make me a janitor.
2024580	2025300	Wait, what?
2026500	2028260	If Murphy's there, I assume I'm there.
2029300	2030340	Oh sure, why not?
2030340	2031060	It's Thomas.
2031060	2032260	Thomas is a janitor.
2034180	2035300	No, you're a maid.
2035300	2036660	You've got fresh towels, baby.
2036660	2039940	I'm gonna go ahead and fly into that office, see if I can't find
2040820	2043940	ol' Keith's name on that list, see where Bean is.
2043940	2049460	And I fly towards the office thinking that the window is just open space.
2053620	2055220	What do you mean see his name?
2056820	2058260	I don't know what you mean.
2058260	2059380	What do you mean, what do you mean?
2060180	2061380	What are you talking about here?
2061940	2063860	You can only hear names.
2063860	2064900	Oh, I can read.
2064900	2066180	I went to college.
2067540	2069140	What is reading?
2070580	2073460	It's like human symbols that mean words.
2074100	2075780	You are not making one lick of sense.
2075780	2078020	Yeah, I don't follow none right here.
2078020	2078820	I'll trust you again.
2078820	2080500	Rusty and Ship roll sanity?
2081940	2082660	No, I'm just kidding.
2085140	2087460	But yeah, I fly through the window.
2088420	2089220	Doonk!
2089220	2090900	But there's some sort of force field.
2092420	2093780	What's a force field, brother?
2094500	2102180	The last thought running through your mind before you were stopped out of absolutely nowhere was,
2102180	2104100	holy shit, that's a big cat.
2106100	2108580	Am I knocked out or am I able to fly away?
2109300	2111860	So go ahead and mark one on your...
2112500	2116340	So we're doing a three check box system for damage here.
2116980	2121220	And if you take a bit of damage, that's minor damage.
2121220	2122580	That's the first box.
2122580	2125140	And if you take some more damage, that's going to be major damage.
2125140	2126580	That's the second box.
2126580	2130900	And then if you take damage a third time, you're going to have severe damage,
2131700	2136100	which is going to require a constitution rule to stay conscious.
2136100	2141300	Otherwise, you're going to have to have one of your teammates help you
2141300	2144580	in order to come back and rejoin the squad.
2145220	2151220	This mechanic that I straight up took one for one from Sam running us through that really fun
2151220	2154980	one shot right before all this quarantine broke out.
2154980	2156900	Rusty sees this happen.
2157620	2159940	The damn fool bird don't know about glass.
2160820	2163380	I've seen it happen many times in my...
2164260	2170660	He tries to multiply how many summers he's been by seven, but he can't because he's a dog.
2174740	2180340	So he just says, in my many summers, I've seen quite a few birds slam against the window.
2180340	2185540	They don't know it's only good for sticking your nose up against and linking.
2185540	2188660	So I'm on the ground, very disoriented.
2188660	2190020	What the fuck just happened?
2190020	2193940	Rusty, in an attempt to revive you, sticks his nose up against you and licks you.
2193940	2194580	Hell yeah.
2194580	2196180	Describe it deeper.
2196180	2201860	Oh, he tries to put his ruffle feathers back in place.
2201860	2202500	He's just like...
2204100	2206900	Yeah, it's a very ginger, like, hey, are you all right?
2206900	2209780	Chip gets on the ground and starts shaking him violently.
2211060	2214420	Little tiny fat chipmunk is like, wake your damn ass up, bro.
2215780	2216820	We got work to do.
2217380	2222180	I get up and I stretch my wings out and flap them off to get any of the spit off.
2222180	2227300	And then I fly up and perch on the little thing next to the window and peck it.
2227940	2234820	And you wake up the giant cat that you saw that was sitting on top of the desk
2234820	2236340	right before you ran in this window.
2236340	2238260	As you peck, it kind of slowly...
2242020	2244420	Hello there, everybody.
2245460	2250100	My name's RoPo and welcome to Hotel Moto.
2250660	2253380	You know, I know you spend more time with her, but that's not RoPo's voice.
2257220	2259060	That's very funny, Tom.
2259060	2266100	I love my sister, Ramona.
2267140	2269060	Could you get Taylor in here to do it right, please?
2269620	2270020	Taylor!
2273380	2275300	Thomas wants to hear your RoPo voice.
2278500	2279300	Taylor gets on like...
2283700	2285140	It has to be better than mine.
2285620	2290580	Hi, guys, it's RoPo.
2293220	2298260	I came to tell you that I just took the biggest shot and it was so fun.
2303940	2305780	RoPo seems weirdly high energy.
2306740	2306980	Yeah.
2308340	2310340	Have you ever seen my ass?
2310340	2322180	That's what RoPo says all the time, though.
2322180	2322660	She's right.
2323460	2326900	Every time she walks up to you and she like rubs against you and meows, she's like,
2326900	2328100	have you seen my ass?
2328100	2329060	Have you seen my ass?
2330260	2333780	I can't find it because my belly's in the way.
2334500	2336580	Boys, I will be back in two shakes.
2336580	2338820	This is what we call...
2338820	2339860	Is it a pee break?
2340580	2341380	Pee break.
2341380	2342900	Everyone leave your recording going.
2342900	2344740	I'm gonna go break as well.
2344740	2347060	Question is, which voice do I come back with?
2354900	2355620	Are you sober?
2356980	2357940	I'm not smoking.
2357940	2358900	Oh, yeah.
2358900	2360340	And I'm out of edibles right now.
2360900	2361540	But I will...
2362100	2364660	I'm also intermittent fasting and...
2365940	2367140	I didn't know you were religious.
2368020	2371780	Yeah, I am really, really deeply religious.
2371780	2381380	And I don't think it's cool to personify animals because they don't have souls.
2382740	2384020	They're not going to heaven.
2384020	2384980	Oh, God.
2384980	2387460	That's for people who love Jesus.
2389300	2390900	A dog can't love Jesus.
2390900	2399620	So THC gets stored in your fat cells for a long ass time.
2399620	2401860	Are you saying and you're not fat anymore?
2401860	2404340	No, I'm still fat.
2404340	2411700	But when I intermittent fast, I definitely feel like I've taken a mild edible during
2411700	2415860	the course of the day, which is cool because my body is getting high on its own supply.
2418500	2419780	You got that slow release.
2420660	2423140	And then the only food he's eating is more edibles.
2428660	2429540	It's not the edibles.
2430900	2431620	It's my fat.
2431620	2435700	So which voice do you guys want me to do for RoPo?
2435700	2436420	Your Santa voice?
2436420	2438260	Whatever you feel comfortable with.
2438260	2442100	I like thinking of RoPo as a weird, big, jolly cat like that.
2442100	2442580	Yeah.
2442580	2444020	Santa Claus it is.
2444020	2444340	All right.
2444900	2449700	Welcome to Ho Ho Ho Ho Hotel Motel.
2450500	2452180	Tyler starts growling at the cat.
2452180	2452740	Yeah.
2452740	2456180	Rusty sees the cat and is startled and goes woof.
2456180	2456820	Hi.
2456820	2461700	RoPo's hair doesn't stand up even a little bit.
2463060	2464900	Are you guys trying to intimidate her?
2464900	2466260	Rusty, no, no, no.
2466260	2467380	It's just a reaction.
2467380	2471780	Rusty tilts his head to the side and then when he sees the cat is no threat, his tail
2471780	2472340	starts wagging.
2472420	2477700	Tyler starts doing like the growl starts to turn into a yip kinda and then like pause
2477700	2481220	down, backs up a little, pause forward, backs up a little.
2481220	2483380	Just trying to gaze what this cat's doing.
2483380	2484660	Hello, my friends.
2484660	2486260	Rusty, what you call this stuff?
2486260	2487860	This force field, what you call it?
2488820	2490900	Oh, it's a window.
2490900	2493940	Hey, RoPo, can you turn this window off?
2498420	2499860	That's a picture of me.
2499860	2501620	I would never want to get rid of it.
2503140	2507300	Would Chip know RoPo as a veteran of the 4C?
2508020	2511380	Chip, it's been a long time, hasn't it?
2511380	2515220	It's good to see you're doing well in these trying times, RoPo.
2515220	2518420	Looks like you haven't been hard up for food none lately.
2518420	2522740	Well, I see you are living lavishly as well, my good sir.
2522740	2526100	I miss our nights together every now and then.
2526100	2528500	Chip slaps his belly a few times.
2528500	2529540	He's like, yeah, brother.
2533060	2534420	That's the Chip I knew.
2535060	2536100	Hey, Cat.
2536100	2538260	Cat, don't you know there's a goo out there?
2538260	2541060	Don't you know it can get into buildings and such?
2541060	2541860	A what?
2541860	2542580	There's a goo.
2542580	2544420	There's a black goo that wants to eat everybody,
2544420	2546180	so all the critters are meeting down at the creek.
2546180	2548740	I've not seen this black goo.
2549780	2551140	Well, keep an eye out for it.
2551140	2556580	RoPo, we need your help to find someone or maybe a couple someones.
2556580	2561540	You know any animals that would be trapped or something in these parts?
2561540	2563300	Are you talking about the dogs?
2563300	2564900	Yeah, Murphy and Bean.
2564900	2565380	Bean.
2565380	2566260	Oh, you almost...
2566260	2567700	Oh, you do know their names.
2568820	2569620	Yes, of course.
2570340	2578660	Well, I'm not much for the symbols, but I believe you'll find where they are on those charts over there.
2578660	2580660	I want to look at the charts.
2580660	2581140	Can you...
2581140	2582100	Did you go to college?
2582740	2582980	Yes.
2584580	2585380	Can you enroll?
2586020	2587380	Critter Community College.
2587940	2588180	Yeah.
2589700	2590500	He's got a critter.
2590500	2591780	What is your skill for that?
2593940	2595220	Intelligence.
2595220	2595540	I thought...
2595540	2596420	Don't you have...
2596420	2598420	You said understand human, which I think means...
2598420	2602500	I could have sworn you had a special skill that meant you could understand, like...
2602500	2603140	Yeah, I can...
2603140	2603540	I have...
2603540	2606100	It's called a little birdie told me.
2607860	2608180	What?
2611220	2613780	When I told you that you could have special skills,
2613780	2620180	you wrote down somewhere that your special skill was a little birdie told me.
2620660	2624980	Yeah, which means I can understand humans and read.
2625940	2627060	I see it needs...
2627060	2628500	I think it has to be one or the other.
2630420	2632500	It's I understand human stuff.
2637620	2639780	Willie's like, have you guys watched The Wire?
2643380	2645540	Dude, I love human stuff.
2645540	2646260	Season two?
2646260	2646980	Are you kidding me?
2648500	2650260	Don't bother with season five.
2650260	2652740	This is now dictating that it's...
2652740	2655220	That you can read and understand stuff.
2655220	2655540	Okay.
2656500	2658340	So go ahead and roll those dice, baby.
2659860	2664420	But if people try to talk to you, boy, you ain't gonna know what they're saying?
2664420	2665060	60.
2665700	2666980	Oh, congratulations.
2666980	2671380	So it very clearly says, hey, Luke, do you know what room Keith Vigna is?
2671380	2673300	If we said it, it was probably seven.
2673860	2674980	I think it was.
2674980	2679300	And then we've got Murphy is on the first floor in room three.
2679380	2681780	We got to go to room seven and three.
2682340	2683940	Do you guys know what that means?
2683940	2684340	No.
2684340	2685860	What the hell are you talking about?
2685860	2691780	RoPo, can you help guide us here to whereabouts we're supposed to search for our friends?
2691780	2693060	Not even a little bit.
2693060	2696180	I believe it's the woodpecker that knows the symbols.
2698420	2701860	I don't know what your quest is or give a fuck about you.
2703620	2704820	Any more, Chip?
2706340	2707540	I dream of you.
2707540	2708660	This is a really tight...
2708660	2710180	This is a really tight game, guys.
2711940	2714740	I can read the symbols on the doors here.
2715380	2717780	This one's seven right here.
2717780	2719860	And I fly over to room seven.
2719860	2721540	Yeah, it's up on the second floor.
2721540	2723620	And you guys go to the stairs.
2723620	2727300	I go to three first then, since it's on the first floor, probably.
2727300	2729300	Is this the one that Bien is in?
2729300	2730660	Is this where Bien is?
2730660	2733940	This one right here is Murphy's, but it's closest.
2733940	2740100	Don't you think we should get beans?
2740100	2741220	He's our mission.
2741220	2742820	He might be able to help us get this other guy.
2743460	2745780	I think we should get beans.
2745780	2747700	What about the other way around?
2747700	2749300	Maybe Murphy can help us.
2749300	2751700	Yeah, and this first dog's on the first floor.
2751700	2754100	Tyler, I'm gonna need you to pull yourself together.
2754100	2756980	These old bones don't get upstairs too well.
2756980	2758580	Tyler starts chasing his tail.
2759140	2760180	He has stopped listening.
2760420	2767460	Can Chip Montgomery pick a little tiny pebble up and throw it at Tyler?
2769140	2770660	Don't throw rocks at dogs.
2770660	2774420	Like really, I'm talking, it's a chipmunk size pebble.
2774420	2778580	Wait, like a pebble for a chipmunk or a pebble that's the size of a chipmunk?
2778580	2782180	No, the pebble for a chipmunk.
2782180	2784020	Because if that's true, Chip is so strong.
2784020	2785460	Chip only has 20 strength.
2785460	2788820	He can barely, he can't lift his own body weight up.
2789620	2792900	Okay, so as this weird squabble is happening,
2792900	2798820	where the cartoon's rocks and chips are changing size rapidly back and forth,
2798820	2804980	I need you guys to roll if you have some sort of like perception ability,
2804980	2808420	special ability that is, or intelligence.
2808420	2809860	Should we all roll then?
2809860	2812260	Hearing and smelling counts as perception, right?
2812900	2814180	It absolutely does.
2814180	2818980	I failed an intelligence check.
2818980	2820020	I failed mine.
2820020	2823940	I passed an intelligence check of 12 on 50.
2824500	2829380	Yeah, fittingly, the two dogs immediately turn and look,
2830020	2836660	and you see driving by slowly is someone who is looking at you,
2836660	2842020	and in the shotgun seat, there's an old person with a cane,
2842020	2845460	and they're shaking the cane at all of you out the window,
2845460	2849620	and they're screaming something in their weird human language,
2850260	2854100	convincing the person who's on the phone to do something.
2854100	2858420	Thomas thinks they're probably calling, trying to call animal control.
2858420	2859940	So does Rusty.
2859940	2862740	Well, Rusty just knows they're up to no good.
2863780	2866740	He's like, I think we need to get a move on.
2866740	2867700	Scatter, brothers.
2868340	2871380	Tyler has been on the run for five days now,
2871380	2873940	and he knows how to avoid humans.
2873940	2879220	He's real skittish, and he's already probably running for under the stairs, maybe.
2879220	2886420	Yeah, and I think maybe even, Tyler, you've seen this caned person before.
2886420	2887540	He's my nemesis.
2888660	2889780	Yeah, exactly.
2891460	2895700	Famed Tyler nemesis, Greargin.
2895700	2896660	Greargin?
2896660	2897540	Fuck, guys, it's Greargin.
2897540	2898820	We have to get out of here.
2898820	2902020	The old contention person.
2904980	2907300	The 300-year-old founder of contention.
2909540	2910580	Nope, they're elsewhere.
2910580	2913620	He just won't die.
2913620	2914580	Wow, spoilies.
2916100	2917060	What are you guys doing?
2919140	2921380	How are you getting into room three or seven?
2921380	2925460	Is there a window on these, like a door with a window next to it?
2925460	2927140	Yeah, they all have a window next to them.
2927140	2930500	I want to peck on the glass of the room three.
2930500	2932660	Look who knows what glass is all of a sudden.
2934900	2936660	His allies taught him.
2936660	2937940	He found out the hard way.
2937940	2944340	That's honestly, that's the most character development we've had on any of the shows so far.
2947060	2947560	All right.
2948500	2954900	Is there any kind of ventilation shafts in and out of these rooms that a small rodent
2954900	2956260	could perhaps go into?
2957620	2959060	Oh, hell yeah, dude.
2959060	2959940	Of course there are.
2960660	2967780	Luke, Wilson is tapping on the glass and the curtain slowly opens with a dark chocolate.
2967780	2968980	I'm talking 92%.
2969860	2972180	Beautiful old dog.
2972180	2972900	Long hair.
2973620	2977860	And it looks at you with these gorgeous knowing eyes.
2978900	2984260	And it says, well, hello there, my good bird friend.
2985220	2987700	I sure would like to get out of this room.
2987700	2989300	Can you turn this window off?
2993940	2996820	Zach, that's, while that's not Murphy's voice, it's close.
2996820	2999300	So, oh, thanks dude.
2999300	3004740	Cut to Chip is running on hind legs through an air vent.
3006820	3008340	I'm really out of shape, my brother.
3008340	3008900	Oh God.
3009940	3011780	John McLean in it.
3011780	3013140	Chip, are you wearing shoes?
3014820	3020180	In my mind, I pictured him wearing like a weird, like fatigues for a little fat.
3021780	3022820	He's a warfatter.
3023540	3025060	He's like he's a prepper squirrel.
3029220	3031940	He's got some sick Nike's on combat.
3031940	3034180	No little combat boots for a chipmunk.
3034180	3037540	Oh man, Justin, I don't want to criticize your role-playing decisions, but you should
3037540	3038740	have been a chipmunk.
3039540	3043460	Oh, like bald on top or like Tony Shalhoub.
3043460	3044660	Oh, yes.
3053860	3054900	All right, let's start over.
3054900	3055860	I'm going to start the recording.
3057380	3062820	It is a brisk December 5th here in contention, made all the more bleak by the-
3062820	3066820	Hey, no shit, I would like, I would start over if you guys wanted to.
3067460	3067780	No.
3067780	3069620	I think we could do this a lot tighter.
3069620	3071540	I loved every second of this.
3071540	3071860	Okay.
3071860	3073060	I think this has been really good.
3073060	3075700	It hasn't been tight, but I like it loose.
3079220	3079860	You heard me.
3082260	3083140	Say what I said.
3086260	3087220	I don't like it loose.
3088100	3088580	Say it.
3089140	3090340	Zach likes it loose.
3095540	3096740	All right, good talk everybody.
3096740	3098420	Did you see my chat to the group?
3098980	3099220	Yes.
3099220	3099460	Yep.
3099780	3103860	Okay, what's Chippy doing?
3103860	3109780	Chip is sprinting as fast as his little chubby legs can take him to try and get to Murphy.
3109780	3112900	Oh yeah, you may get to the vent that's on the other side.
3112900	3116260	Is there a little, can I, is there like a little pocket I can squeeze through in the
3116260	3116980	ventilation?
3119380	3119860	What happened?
3120980	3123620	Yeah, but it's a really wide-
3123620	3124980	No, no, no, listen to me.
3125940	3126020	It's round.
3126020	3127060	It's really wide.
3127060	3132500	But it's really wide and there's some like oil that's just like dripping from it.
3132500	3133300	It's very strange.
3135060	3136420	Wait, what are we talking about?
3136420	3137540	Are we talking about your wife?
3139700	3140420	Holy shit.
3140420	3142900	That is extremely rude, Justin.
3143540	3147220	Yeah, why would you ever say that to me?
3147220	3165220	We are not lazy enough, basically.
3165220	3169060	Did Thomas just say, I'm the devil and I'll be back?
3169060	3170660	Yeah, I think that's what this meant.
3170660	3172260	Oh, Jesus Christ.
3173220	3174580	One, two, three.
3177940	3179300	All right, let's get back to it.
3179300	3183860	My earphones just said my battery is low, so I don't know how much, I don't know what
3183860	3184340	that means.
3185460	3186340	Wait, what?
3187300	3188580	I've got these wireless.
3189220	3189620	Yeah.
3189620	3192260	Can you plug them in while you're wearing them?
3192260	3195940	The cord's like this long, but it should, it should be fine.
3197300	3198420	So let's keep going.
3199060	3199780	Some-
3199780	3200260	Body.
3202260	3202760	Morns.
3203620	3204020	Yeah.
3204100	3211940	On my Animal Crossing game, I made the town theme song All Star.
3213060	3213940	That's really cute.
3214660	3221700	Okay, so you guys are on the outside of this window and the Wilson the woodpecker just
3221700	3224660	asked to turn the glass off.
3224660	3232980	The two dogs are right behind the woodpecker and Chip the chipmunk is about to bust into
3232980	3234900	a grate that is into this room.
3234900	3236660	Chip is always about to bust.
3239780	3242180	I explained that to Murphy.
3242180	3244660	I'm like, hold on there, little fella.
3245220	3248420	Help is coming in the form of a chipmunk.
3248420	3249380	Please don't eat it.
3250580	3255300	Although you might be tempted, he is on our side and he's going to help you get out of
3255300	3255860	that room.
3255860	3258500	I'm curious, do you guys have a plan, Chip?
3258500	3260660	Do you have a plan to help him get out of the room?
3260660	3264820	A real leader takes action and then thinks about it much later.
3264820	3270660	I'm assuming since we're all animals at every door in this hotel is a lever, not a knob.
3271220	3273060	This is a hotel motel for humans.
3273060	3274740	No, it's one of those things.
3274740	3275380	It's a push.
3276580	3278100	So it's just got like a push bar.
3278660	3279860	So none of the doors lock?
3280500	3281380	No, those lock.
3281380	3282980	You just have to use an Allen wrench.
3282980	3286340	I'm going to shout at Murphy from the ventilation.
3286900	3287400	Murphy.
3288180	3288740	Yeah.
3288820	3289860	Now I'm going to come on down.
3289860	3290740	Don't eat me now.
3291300	3291800	Okay.
3292900	3297620	I just really need you to promise me that there ain't going to be no eating of old chip
3297620	3298120	tonight.
3298740	3299700	Roll intelligence.
3300340	3302420	I would never even consider it.
3302420	3304100	I pass 38 on a 40.
3304100	3306420	Oh yeah, no, he would never even consider it.
3307300	3308660	All right now.
3308660	3312260	Well, to be fair, the real Murphy would absolutely consider it.
3312260	3315300	But if you explained it to him, he would know to hold off.
3316020	3317140	That's good to know.
3319380	3323700	Chip will, however he got through the other ventilation, like, I don't know, is it from
3323700	3326260	the ceiling I'm coming or below?
3326260	3326900	Oh yeah.
3326900	3327220	Yeah.
3327220	3327940	From the wall.
3327940	3331460	I have a climbing skill to, to get out safely.
3331460	3331960	Perfect.
3332660	3335780	Describe how you rappel down this hotel wall.
3335780	3341780	Well, uh, chip wants to use some of his old combat moves from the old days.
3341780	3345540	So I'd like to think he like does like a sick ass, like combat role.
3345620	3348740	Like he like slides down the wall with one hand on the wall.
3348740	3353540	So it slows him down with his little tiny, weird, creepy fingernails that rodents have.
3353540	3354820	And he goes down really slow.
3354820	3359060	And then as he lands, he does like a little combat role and like jumps up and he's like,
3359060	3360260	Oh, I love it.
3360260	3362020	Very, very flashy entrance.
3362020	3363380	He's like, now is my time.
3364820	3370980	Speaking of combat and Murphy, he has, uh, he has a hundred in all stats and he, instead
3370980	3373380	of three health boxes, he has a billion.
3373380	3376180	So, so you can't hurt him, Zach.
3377380	3378900	I think you know me better than that.
3380980	3381220	Yeah.
3381220	3381860	I think I do.
3382500	3383940	What do you think of me?
3383940	3386660	I think he would hurt my dog in a role-playing game
3392020	3395380	to elicit like a genuine emotional response from your players.
3396580	3401620	Tyler sees chip fall into the room and he goes and bumps his face into the window.
3401620	3402020	Excited.
3405140	3405640	Yeah.
3406180	3410660	Both the dogs seen the chipmunk forget it's their friend and like bark.
3412580	3417220	When Tyler bumps into the glass, uh, I'm like, Oh, that's a pretty good idea.
3417220	3419380	And I start pecking at the glass.
3420820	3423860	Oh, that's your skill.
3423860	3427700	I'm going to use my pecking skill to pack the glass.
3427700	3428660	Can you break it open?
3429860	3430360	Okay.
3431320	3435960	Luke Wilson, the woodpecker is standing on that little ledge that windows have.
3436840	3445880	And you begin slowly pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack,
3445880	3451080	pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack, pack,
3451080	3458840	and you start seeing like shards and then sparks as you're going so slowly.
3459800	3465640	So slowly through this glass, but your beak movement is so fast that these little
3465640	3468360	shards sparks of glass begin flying out.
3468360	3474760	And then finally you can smell the stale motel air on the other side.
3475400	3478120	And then the camera zooms out really fast and there's a
3479480	3482040	as a bunch of different spider web breaks on the glass.
3482040	3487240	And then it into pebbles as both dogs from the outside.
3488200	3488700	No.
3489560	3499160	As Murphy on the inside comes bounding through the glass to the outdoors being ridden by chip.
3500040	3501800	And what is chip doing on top?
3501800	3506840	He's a writing it like a Khaleesi does on the dragons where he's like holding it.
3512360	3513160	That's great.
3513160	3516920	He's up near its neck, like holding it and trying to guide it.
3517240	3520920	Rusty gives Murphy a big old lick on the face because he's a good boy.
3520920	3523160	And a lick is returned.
3523160	3524200	Tyler sniffs his ass.
3525000	3525960	Oh, how rude of me.
3528200	3529480	Rusty sniffs his ass too.
3531880	3533160	What kind of vibe do I pick up?
3535160	3538600	Would we know Murphy or is Murphy news to us?
3538600	3546920	So Murphy is just you've heard tell that there's an old wise wizard that lives in
3546920	3554520	Hotel Motel, but you've never you've never met this Murphy, but he seems to just be
3554520	3557800	here passing through or for a short time.
3557800	3563400	No one really passes through contention, but people do come and leave shortly thereafter.
3563400	3568600	Now, Murphy, we're part of something called the Contention Creek Critter Coalition,
3568600	3571400	and we're here to help all the animals we can.
3571400	3573240	And in particular one that's upstairs right now.
3574920	3575800	We got to get up there.
3576280	3580840	Murphy, have you have you smelled the other dog around here, Bean?
3580840	3581560	Oh, yes.
3582680	3585000	Up in room seven.
3586120	3587720	Can you could you guide us there?
3588280	3589800	Well, but of course.
3591000	3592920	And then you're all standing outside room seven.
3592920	3593880	Let's do it again, boys.
3593880	3594680	Come on.
3594680	3595000	Same.
3595000	3595160	Yeah.
3595160	3595960	Same game plan.
3596520	3597480	Go for it, Willy.
3597480	3598200	Holy shit.
3598200	3600120	OK, hold up.
3600120	3608760	Cut to the glass shattering as Bean, a gorgeous golden retriever, jumps through the window
3608760	3610440	with Chip on his back.
3614200	3615080	And we won.
3615080	3617080	Thanks for subscribing to the Patreon.
3619480	3620600	Is this a Patreon episode?
3621240	3621960	Oh, it's high.
3621960	3622460	Well.
3623880	3624760	Go do it anyway.
3626360	3627960	Thanks for nothing, cucks.
3627960	3629160	Subscribe to the Patreon.
3630360	3631960	Oh, boy.
3631960	3633640	We got to get you back to safety, Bean.
3634680	3636200	Wait, did that actually happen, though?
3636200	3637480	Oh, hell yeah.
3637480	3638040	Give us a.
3639480	3641000	Hey, Luke, what is Bean sound like?
3641000	3641400	Yeah.
3641400	3642600	What should I do?
3642600	3644200	Oh, he's like.
3645160	3649320	Remember, you have the opportunity to describe a voice that Zach has to do.
3649880	3650760	Do not waste.
3654760	3656840	He sounds like Captain Peanut Butter.
3656840	3658200	Mr. Peanut Butter?
3658200	3659640	No, Captain Peanut Butter.
3659640	3661640	The like Lumberjack.
3661640	3662680	Mr. Peanut Butter.
3662680	3664520	It's Mr. Peanut Butter's brother.
3664520	3665720	Mr. Peanut Butter's brother.
3665720	3666200	Gotcha.
3666200	3666680	Yeah.
3666680	3667880	BoJack Horseman, y'all.
3667880	3668200	All right.
3668200	3670360	Just do an excited Labrador voice then.
3675080	3677480	So exactly Joe's voice.
3677480	3680120	Do a different dog's voice for this dog.
3684600	3685960	Does someone fart?
3685960	3686680	What was that?
3686760	3687560	Was that Luke?
3688360	3689400	What did you fart?
3690520	3692200	I think it was my chair.
3693480	3698200	As soon as that sound happens, Luke, you coincidentally made a face like you farted
3698200	3701160	and you knew it and you're a real squeaker.
3702120	3705000	My headphones keep telling me I got low battery, so I was like.
3708120	3710040	Luke, what is Bean sound like?
3710040	3713880	Okay, he sounds like Woody from Toy Story.
3713880	3715400	He sounds like Woody the Woodpecker.
3716840	3720200	I'm Bean.
3721960	3722520	There you go.
3725000	3729000	Since Bean's dad is a cop, he's like a rebellious teenager.
3729000	3729720	Okay.
3729720	3731160	Yeah, that's good.
3731160	3732840	Thanks for saving me, guys.
3732840	3735080	But I was fine in there alone.
3735080	3736840	How long have you been in there?
3736840	3737720	How long have you been in there?
3737720	3740200	Also, keep in mind, everyone loves this guy.
3743240	3745560	I thought Bean was the smartest voice.
3746760	3748440	Most compassionate and caring.
3748440	3749720	What's up, fuck sticks?
3752760	3754600	I'm so fucking smart.
3754600	3756520	Hey, pussies, is your mom hot too?
3761640	3762440	Jesus.
3762440	3764040	Do you guys want to sniff my butt?
3764040	3766920	If you'll let us.
3767480	3768680	Yeah, hop on back here.
3770040	3771320	Got you, dude.
3771320	3772280	Ah, shit.
3773240	3773640	Rusty.
3774200	3776760	Did you guys see Rusty get a rusty eye?
3776760	3777960	Oh, shit.
3777960	3783080	Rusty is unbelievably honored that you would gift him with that extra smell.
3783080	3784040	Dude, hell yeah, man.
3784040	3785480	You got my stink on you now.
3785480	3786200	Do you love it?
3786920	3787560	I do.
3787560	3788040	That would.
3788040	3789320	Do you fucking love it?
3789320	3790360	Let's get out of here, bro.
3790360	3793400	That's one of the finest ass smells I've ever smelled.
3793400	3794360	Oh, hell yeah.
3794360	3796120	Thanks, Luke, for doing this to me.
3796120	3798360	How long have you been trapped in here?
3798360	3799080	Oh, God.
3799080	3800440	This piece of shit, man.
3800440	3801560	I don't even know.
3801560	3805640	He's my bro-lo for ro-lo, but I don't even know-lo.
3807720	3809960	How are you surviving in there all alone?
3809960	3813000	Honestly, just jacking it nonstop.
3813640	3816440	Just little red riding head lipstick in this motherfucker.
3816440	3817320	Jack links.
3817320	3818680	There's a bunch of jerky in there.
3818680	3820520	Oh, just rocking my jerky.
3822840	3824040	I hate this character.
3824040	3825080	I hate this character.
3826840	3829240	Yeah, let's put him back.
3829240	3830680	Let's not rescue this guy.
3830680	3831180	Yeah.
3833080	3835080	Hey, Luke, what does Bean sound like?
3835080	3836440	Like a little tiny girl.
3843080	3844840	Thanks for saving me, guys.
3844840	3848840	As you bust through, and the glass just pebbles down and cascades,
3848840	3854120	and you're all standing there in a line from, like, tallest in the middle,
3854120	3857880	and then, like, well-crafted shot design all the way through,
3857960	3860920	and you're all standing in a line sideways, it's beautiful,
3860920	3864280	and the glass just, like, shatters at your feet into pebbles,
3864280	3867160	and then you see, like, in the foreground,
3867160	3871560	the animal control van pulls up, and it is game time.
3871560	3872280	Oh shit, the fuzz!
3874920	3877160	The fuzz is here, but we can take him?
3877160	3882920	Chip starts punching his little tiny fist into his little tiny hand over and over again.
3882920	3885400	Make him surfer god instead of little girl.
3885480	3886920	No time to sniff butts.
3887560	3889640	We've got the man to take on.
3889640	3891160	It's time to...
3891160	3893000	To roll initiative, doggy style.
3895880	3897800	Yes, a hundred percent that.
3897800	3902920	Lettuce, tomato, roll your dice on dexterity.
3902920	3904200	It's a deck structure.
3904200	3905000	That's my worst.
3905880	3907880	I got a 47 on a 60.
3907880	3909080	I failed.
3909080	3910600	17 on a 20.
3910600	3913080	I passed with a 38 on a 70.
3913080	3921640	The animal control folk rolled a 66 on a 60.
3924040	3926120	So you will all get to go first.
3926120	3928520	So you guys can decide as a group.
3929800	3931000	Yes, absolutely.
3931000	3931720	Literally, it's...
3932760	3933800	God, who should it be?
3933800	3936360	It should be a pair of doofuses.
3936360	3940760	Well, I imagine it's just Ron and Hugo from...
3940760	3941960	Oh, that's better.
3941960	3943480	Except Rip Harris.
3944840	3946600	Yeah, it'll be an honor.
3949320	3951480	No, they're both Sewage Joe.
3951480	3952200	Who's that?
3952200	3953160	Sewage Joe?
3953160	3954120	From Parks and Rec?
3954760	3955240	Oh, yeah.
3955240	3957080	Oh, the perverted guy.
3958040	3958540	Yeah.
3959000	3964200	One of them and then the surgeon on scrubs with the do-rag.
3964200	3965080	Oh, the Todd.
3966600	3967720	The Todd.
3967720	3969080	Hell yeah, it's the Todd.
3969080	3973000	And Sewage Joe.
3976040	3977000	Fantastic.
3977000	3979720	And both in dark blue jumpsuits.
3979720	3981640	Oh yeah, I like that.
3981640	3983560	And they both have taser guns.
3983560	3985480	No, not guns, prods.
3985480	3985980	Oh no.
3986600	3988120	And they're just coming from Murphy.
3988120	3994040	No, they're just coming from Murphy.
3994040	3996200	Sacrifices themselves so that we may go...
3998920	4000440	I quit the podcast forever.
4002120	4003000	I love you, Luke.
4003000	4003800	I love you, Justin.
4003800	4004600	I love you, Joe.
4005880	4006840	Fuck you, Zach.
4008520	4010040	It's just that it's 2020.
4010040	4012040	It's gotten me all shook up.
4012040	4013320	I'm gonna go hug my dog.
4015480	4017000	Okay, it's game time.
4017000	4018600	When they pull up, I look at the other guys.
4018600	4023560	I'm like, they cut down my favorite tree just because I was pecking on it in the park.
4023640	4024600	Fuck these guys.
4025560	4027160	Yeah, these guys are bad news.
4027160	4030280	They've been looking for me for days and I've been out running them,
4030280	4032120	but I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, guys.
4032120	4032920	They're right there.
4032920	4037080	It don't take much to get old Chip all riled up for action.
4037080	4042040	First of all, Willie, you know, I don't know much about human bureaucracy,
4042040	4044200	but it seems like that must have been unrelated.
4044200	4047560	I don't know if that's within the purview of animal control.
4048760	4050440	I'm learning a lot of new words today.
4050440	4052520	Bureaucracy, window, glass.
4054200	4055400	It's a big old world.
4055400	4062040	All I know is I've got it out for these fuckers and I take off and I fly towards them
4062600	4066120	and I take a shit aiming for Todd's eye.
4067160	4069320	Yes, dive bomb.
4070600	4075720	Okay, yeah, we'll just do all of these as contested rules, I suppose.
4075720	4079080	And if you hit the same person twice in a round,
4079080	4084440	then they'll be at a disadvantage for that second and whatever role.
4084440	4086840	He's gonna try to high-five it out of the way.
4087960	4093080	You're gonna roll Dexterity or Intelligence, whichever one is higher,
4093080	4097720	unless you have a special skill that would help more in a shitty situation.
4097720	4100040	Oh shit, my headphones just died.
4101240	4104040	Well, Luke, time to find some more headphones to put on.
4104680	4108200	In the meantime, I'd be interested to see what he rolled
4108200	4114920	because I rolled a 49 on the Todd's ability to high-five.
4116680	4117480	Probably pretty high.
4118360	4121480	Okay, so I'm gonna roll Dexterity.
4121480	4122040	Is that what he said?
4122920	4125000	Yeah, or Intelligence, whichever one's higher.
4126360	4127880	I already told them what I rolled.
4127880	4130520	I got a 51 on a 60.
4131640	4132200	Nice.
4132200	4132840	What did you get?
4132840	4136360	Dude, you got a 49, you fucking...
4136840	4138360	You barely beat the contestant.
4138360	4139000	That's so good.
4139000	4144360	As the Todd goes to high-five the stream of shit, it goes right...
4144360	4150760	It literally curves around his hand like James McAvoy shooting a bullet,
4150760	4156360	and it hits the Todd square in the eye, disabling him for the entire round.
4156360	4158360	Rusty barks in approval.
4159400	4160920	Did you guys see that shit?
4160920	4161880	He sure did.
4161880	4163880	God.
4163880	4168840	I don't get it.
4169880	4176280	The rest of you can decide on an idea where you could help each other do something,
4176280	4182040	or basically you have the entire round yourselves before there's a reaction from Sewage Joe.
4183800	4184920	Listen, y'all.
4184920	4191000	We've got four dogs and a chipmunk, and they're just two stupid humans.
4191000	4194520	I think if we work together, we can herd these fuckers.
4194520	4196840	We can round them up and take care of business.
4196840	4200600	Rusty, you think you could throw me on one of them son of a bitching guys?
4201240	4202120	No, I'm a dog.
4202120	4203720	I don't have opposable thumbs.
4203720	4210280	Now I'm talking like using that big old mouth of yours, wiggling me around, tossing me up on them.
4210280	4212680	Then I can do some good work up close.
4212680	4217240	I'm afraid if I get you in my mouth, the temptation to just chomp down will be too high.
4217880	4219400	Tyler runs over and does it.
4221480	4222120	Oh shit.
4224120	4228440	He just flings you with his head real quick in one swift motion.
4229240	4233800	I want to be flipped at the guy who has shit in his eyes and face,
4233800	4237800	so that he doesn't see the beat down that's coming to him.
4237800	4242040	Yeah, so he's got disadvantage, like a lot of it.
4242040	4243400	No, he's like fully disabled.
4244280	4247640	Okay, I want to describe something terrible for you.
4249960	4250360	Do you?
4251960	4253240	I really do.
4253240	4259800	Do you want a mass walk out of your podcast when you fuck with these adorable animals?
4261240	4264440	Choose your words carefully, motherfucker.
4264440	4268120	I always try not to say um or like, but I still do sometimes.
4268120	4268680	It's okay.
4270120	4271480	Um, like is it?
4273160	4277800	As Chip is being flung at the Todd,
4277800	4284360	who has his eyes covered in the fecal matter of Wilson the woodpecker.
4284360	4287720	It's getting in his mouth because it's open because he's screaming about it
4287720	4291240	and it's dripping down into his mouth and it's all over his tongue.
4291240	4294120	Like he just licked ice cream, but it wasn't his bird shit.
4294120	4298680	And he's like, no, no, you hit him square in the jaw.
4299480	4304680	And at the exact same time, you see a masked bandit
4305320	4309960	who has snuck out of its cage in the back of the animal control truck
4310920	4315400	and is hitting the Todd on the opposite side of the head in the opposite direction
4315400	4318440	at the exact same time as you're hitting his chin.
4319000	4328600	And the two of you chip the chipmunk and Rocky the raccoon just snap the Todd's neck.
4330760	4334280	As his shoulders hit the ground, so does the back of his head.
4334680	4337320	Front of his shoulders, the back of his head.
4341320	4347960	So facing up is his back and a face that's covered in Wilson the woodpecker shit.
4348600	4349080	William.
4352280	4353400	It's Wilson.
4353400	4354120	It's Willie.
4355640	4356360	Is it Wilson?
4357160	4358200	I thought it was Willie.
4358200	4359160	You didn't call me Willie.
4359160	4359880	I have been.
4360520	4361000	It fits.
4361320	4374120	Seeing that, Rusty gets into an aggressive stance and it starts growling at Sewage Joe.
4374760	4376920	And I just want to try to intimidate him.
4377480	4380280	We just killed your motherfucking co-worker.
4381720	4384600	Why don't you step the fuck off, idiot?
4384600	4387080	We'll roll power against power.
4387720	4397960	Now I'm going to say Sewage Joe has a mental power of 30 because he's a flatter thing.
4401880	4404680	Rusty is not super physically gifted.
4405720	4409320	He's got a 20 decks and a 30 strength, but he has a 70 power.
4409320	4410760	So unless I fuck up the roll.
4413080	4413720	No, fuck.
4414520	4415880	I rolled a 75.
4415880	4416600	That's over, right?
4417080	4417960	I rolled a 13.
4419960	4421960	There was so much opportunity.
4421960	4425480	I thought that you critically failed based on your reaction.
4426600	4429400	I just thought there was like, yeah, you were going to win.
4429400	4429880	It's good.
4429880	4432200	I like that amount of commitment.
4432200	4433320	That's just my face, man.
4434760	4435640	I like your face.
4435640	4436520	Thanks, baby.
4436520	4445080	So I want you to tell me what is going through the mind of this Sewage Joe.
4445960	4448760	When he looks into the eyes of Rusty.
4448760	4456040	So as soon as Joe sees his best friend in the world, the Todd, shit on and like that
4456040	4457240	like freaks him out.
4457240	4463320	But then he sees his fucking neck get snapped by a chipmunk and a raccoon.
4464200	4469000	And then Rusty in the lead, Bean and Murphy flanking him.
4469960	4473160	Maybe Tyler's chasing his tail in the background.
4474120	4479240	But these dogs with their hackles up are like slowly advancing on him.
4479240	4481320	And you see the wolf in them.
4481320	4485960	They're a pack of predators and they're just staring him down and growling.
4485960	4488600	And he knows he needs to get the fuck out of there.
4489560	4494440	It convinces Sewage Joe to drive you all back to the creek.
4496680	4497800	Isn't it just right there?
4500360	4501720	That would take longer.
4501800	4508840	Rusty like locks eyes with him, growls and then points his snout at all the cages like
4508840	4509340	in the back.
4510040	4513960	And he intimates that he needs to free the other animals as well.
4513960	4516840	Oh, yes, no, I will be just one moment.
4516840	4517800	I will do that.
4517800	4520840	If he takes his time out here, I will head in there and I will take care of it.
4520840	4522120	And then I will be right back.
4522120	4523560	You started out French.
4524280	4525720	No, I have never been French.
4525720	4528760	I have only been what I am, which is Rocky the raccoon.
4528760	4536600	And I will easily take everyone and get them out of there if you just have him stand there
4536600	4537320	real quick.
4537320	4538360	Yes, of course.
4538360	4544360	And so he, this little raccoon runs into the back of the animal control van.
4544360	4549400	And soon there's a parade of animals, three long.
4550360	4555880	It's the raccoon that just went in there, a fox, a little red fox.
4556680	4559800	And there is a goat.
4561640	4566120	Fox and a goat and a raccoon, but that's too many character voices to do.
4566120	4569160	So we're going to get you guys back onto the Creek.
4569160	4574760	And so can I, can Wilson do something else to enact his revenge?
4575320	4577240	One bit of revenge from Wilson.
4577240	4577560	Wait.
4577560	4577720	Yeah.
4577720	4578920	Cause they cut my tree down.
4580840	4582680	Oh, well, one of them's dead.
4583080	4589080	Or yeah, you helped to kill like in terms of eye for an eye.
4589080	4591480	I want to, can I land on his head?
4591480	4594040	If you go for revenge, I will kill you.
4594040	4594280	Why?
4598840	4601640	You are one woodpecker against a grown human.
4601640	4603880	I want to pick his eyeballs.
4603880	4609800	Who just saw that woodpecker and a raccoon kill his best friend and a chipmunk.
4609800	4610840	But I'm not sewage Joe.
4610920	4612920	You're a sewage Joe.
4612920	4613640	Gloves off.
4615640	4623320	He'll try, but Rusty sees you like staring down at him and he's like, I just wanted to
4623320	4629800	reiterate that animal control has nothing to do with cutting down trees in the park.
4629800	4632040	I really think those were different people.
4633480	4639320	Maybe the utility company, or perhaps even just a local, you know, tree service.
4639960	4643080	Uh, that tree might've been rotted, might've been about to fall.
4643640	4645800	I just don't think this is the guy who cut down.
4645800	4651000	Wilson, I know your hatred for humans runs deep, but you're, you're, you're, you're taking
4651000	4652040	it too far, man.
4652040	4654040	We're, we got a mission to complete here.
4654040	4663640	We're not saying he don't deserve to die, but Wilson is blinded by rage and brushes
4663640	4664440	off the comments.
4666520	4667320	Go for it, baby.
4668040	4670600	I want to land on his head and peck his eyeballs out.
4672040	4675240	He's already in the, he's in the, he's in the van.
4675240	4677000	I swooped through the open window.
4678120	4682040	It wasn't open and you smack into it and you're a killer.
4682040	4683800	I only have one box check.
4683800	4684040	Yes.
4684680	4685080	Okay.
4685080	4689320	Take your second damage, you motherfucker, because you definitely just flew.
4691960	4694520	Wait, roll intelligence for the sake of playing.
4694520	4695240	21 on a 20.
4695240	4696520	He knows what class is now.
4697800	4700520	21 on a 20.
4700520	4702040	That makes me so happy.
4702040	4703080	That is so perfect.
4705240	4713560	You slam into the glass of the animal control van and he looks out and you guys make direct
4713560	4716520	eye contact as he's driving away.
4716520	4721000	And let me tell you something Wilson, he looks scared.
4721000	4721480	Good job.
4721480	4726680	Can I at least crack his window to make his day inconvenient other than his dead friend?
4727400	4732440	Other than his partner dying and all the animals is hanging.
4732440	4736040	His best friend died and he was bad at his job.
4736040	4738920	The only two things that exist in this man's life.
4738920	4739560	I'll take it.
4739560	4741400	Oh, my window's cracked.
4741400	4743720	This is a bigger inconvenience than my partner.
4743720	4744280	What a day.
4745560	4748840	But do please roll strength for cracking that window.
4748840	4750120	44 on a 70.
4750680	4751880	Critically succeeding.
4754760	4755320	Yep.
4755320	4756040	I'm content.
4756840	4759480	You crack it so hard that it can't roll down.
4761960	4763240	You fucking showed him, dude.
4765080	4767560	Okay, let's get back to the creek, I guess.
4767560	4771960	As the van speeds away, Tyler's gonna give chase for the tire for a second.
4772520	4776760	And then when it gets fast enough that he can't keep up, he comes back to join the group.
4778760	4783640	When you join the group, Rusty, Bean, and Murphy all sniff your butt in my group hills.
4783640	4785080	Oh, thanks.
4785880	4786680	Thanks, fellas.
4786680	4791880	I'm picturing just like a made pole dance of y'all just going around the circle,
4792920	4794440	conga line butt sniffing.
4794440	4794840	Oh, yeah.
4795960	4800280	Rusty says to the chipmunk and the woodpecker, you guys want to get in on this?
4801480	4801720	No.
4802280	4807240	Chip stands back with his arms folded, but a little wry smile goes across his face.
4810280	4812440	He's like proud of his journey, doesn't he?
4812520	4817800	I go and perch on the goats and horns and what's up, kid?
4824040	4825480	Can this goat be for hand pressure?
4827480	4829000	Well, of course.
4833080	4836200	Hey, well, we're attracted to that goat lady.
4836200	4841400	I don't think it's good.
4841400	4844200	We ought to get back to the safety of the creek.
4844200	4845560	Yeah, Beans, we got you, Beans.
4846360	4849720	The squirrel, he sent us and we're supposed to bring it back to the creek.
4849720	4855240	This actually, this seemed like a really good just like last shot of y'all celebrating in
4855240	4856040	the parking lot.
4856040	4858200	So I think let's just hang it out there.
4858200	4859000	Freeze frame.
4859000	4860840	Freeze frame, credits roll.
4860840	4866360	All right.
4866360	4867720	I think we should start recording.
4867720	4868360	Yeah.
4868360	4869720	Now that we've rehearsed it.
4869720	4871880	That was a really good dry run.
4873080	4874120	What are warmups for?
4874920	4882520	While the credits are rolling, it has a shot of Wilson, the woodpecker, and it says Wilson
4882520	4887480	found a new favorite tree and never left it because he's deathly afraid that there are
4887480	4888760	windows in the sky now.
4891720	4892600	It's really sad.
4892600	4893240	He's content.
4894280	4896600	Are we going back to the creek or is this?
4896600	4898360	No, what's your freeze frame, Justin?
4899720	4900760	Pass for now.
4900760	4901560	Not an option.
4901560	4905080	I'll do some minor characters in between your guys's big ones.
4905640	4907400	And obviously Murphy will be the last.
4908600	4910600	Murphy dies immediately.
4910600	4912040	Yes, be careful, motherfucker.
4913560	4916440	Oh, right off the bat, we've got the very first one.
4916520	4919640	We've got Stallone, the old gray squirrel.
4919640	4927000	And it says Stallone carried his torch well, but not for long as he was gotten on the very
4927000	4933320	next run, laying down his life for others on a run to get nuts.
4933320	4935000	It was Stallone, which one?
4935000	4935480	Yep.
4935480	4936760	See, that's why he was first.
4936760	4940760	He was the squirrel that was the head of the contention Creek critter coalition.
4941720	4943640	Making way for a new leader.
4943640	4945160	Just a little foreshadowing.
4945160	4946120	Chip Montgomery.
4947080	4951880	Can chip Montgomery be the leader or does his beans going to be a chipmunk?
4951880	4955560	He talks about how he wanted to be a leader, but people didn't believe in him.
4955560	4958120	And now he, after the successful mission, he's...
4958120	4958840	I'm sorry.
4958840	4962680	You're, you're questioning whether a chipmunk can be a leader after a squirrel.
4964120	4965720	Well, squirrel is one thing.
4965720	4966200	Wow.
4966200	4966920	But a chipmunk?
4966920	4968200	Thomas, do you have a good one?
4968200	4969960	Yeah, Rusty ate chocolate and died.
4970760	4973880	Oh, Jesus Christ.
4973880	4975400	God, who is the next smallest?
4975400	4976600	Oh, uh, Common.
4977800	4982200	Common died, uh, on the side of the road, dot, dot, dot.
4983240	4984360	Or did he?
4984360	4986120	You know, something of that nature.
4986120	4991960	And then, uh, the dead possum picture up on the screen winks at you with a little star
4991960	4992280	that goes...
4992280	4994440	Oh, I'm glad Common's okay.
4994440	4996120	Even though I hate him and all his family.
4996120	5004120	Uh, and then RoPo is still just, uh, sitting like the picture of her is sitting on the
5004120	5009720	desk and then it says, uh, RoPo found out what the black goo was the hard way.
5009720	5009880	No.
5013880	5018120	The freeze frame on Tyler is him kind of veering away from the group.
5019000	5024520	And, uh, he got distracted and saw a snake in the grass and started following it.
5024520	5026200	And you guys haven't heard from him since.
5026920	5027800	I don't like that.
5029800	5031960	Maybe he'll turn up at a dirty dog grooming in the city.
5031960	5038520	There's a picture of Rocky the raccoon, uh, sniffing the butt of Rusty.
5039480	5047560	Rocky made a, made a good friend and then had to tragically watch him die slowly from
5047560	5048840	chocolate poisoning.
5048840	5050040	Did Rocky give it to him?
5050760	5051560	Oh my God.
5052520	5054600	Shared it with him unknowing.
5055320	5059000	I don't think animals know what they can't eat because then they wouldn't eat it.
5059000	5060120	What is Chip's?
5060120	5066600	Chip would continue fighting to be the leader of the Contention Creek Critter Coalition
5066600	5071320	despite his age, but no one would accept him because he's an old fat asshole.
5072520	5079960	And then there's a picture of Murphy and it says Murphy was immediately elected the new
5080040	5082280	leader of the Contention.
5083960	5086520	Thomas's eyes just lit up so big.
5087640	5093960	The Contention Creek Critter Coalition and remains leader fighting off
5097880	5100120	the chipmunk to this day.
5102680	5104440	That was the end.
5105400	5106520	Did you guys like that?
5110200	5113080	I don't know if we did a good job.
5116680	5120040	I know I did a good job and that's all I care about.
5122920	5124920	That's the only thing in my control.
5124920	5129560	I mean, we can talk more later about Thomas's job.
5131320	5132440	No, it was fun.
5132440	5133400	I like you guys.
5133400	5134360	Yeah, I had fun.
5135160	5136360	You're great too, man.
5136360	5137560	I'm going to start the recording now.
5169960	5176040	The only one trying to pull over.
5176040	5184040	How can you have enough drowning out of the noise.
5184040	5190040	With nobody home.
5190040	5194040	Nobody home.
5194040	5198040	Nobody home.
