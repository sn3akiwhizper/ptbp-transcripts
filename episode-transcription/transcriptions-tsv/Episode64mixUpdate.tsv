0	8160	My producer just handed me a note, just a content warning up front on this one for my wolf pups.
8160	16000	Caution, these boys have done some fucked up shit on this show, but this is perhaps a bit more intense.
16000	24400	If you or anyone you know are dealing with suicidal thoughts, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.
24400	29200	1-800-273-8255.
29200	31520	Take care of yourself, y'all.
33760	38880	Bonjour, my beautiful, bountiful, bouncing baby babies.
38880	44800	Papa Wolf is here to cradle you to sleep with my soothing grumbles and growls.
44800	53440	As always, I am lulling y'all to your dream states live from 694.2 PTBP.
53680	59440	I just want to let y'all know, it's December 6th, and it is the night time.
59440	66320	The good numbers of 6.9 and 4.2 are here to smear me and smear.
66320	70160	That's that good cream, the sweet cream.
70160	74880	When I get all lathered up in cream, y'all know what time it is.
74880	78880	It's Howlin' with Wolf O'Clock, daddios and momios.
78880	81680	This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Dustin,
81680	85200	who tagged that pretending pod in a tweet that read,
85200	89200	A stoner, a Jedi, and a surgeon walkin' to a bar.
89760	93040	Blunt. Force. Trauma.
93040	97760	Hell yeah. Jesus Christ. Good job, Dustin.
97760	100960	Dustin writes, Salutations, Wolf.
100960	108080	Dustin the Wind here, from Toledo, Ohio, aka the armpit of the Midwest.
108080	113520	I'm new to the saga of contention, but after my first listen,
113520	116960	I'm made like Muse and plugged in baby.
116960	121440	Now I'm all cut up on the backlog and hungry for more.
121440	125760	Just like I'm hungry for the taste sensation that's sweeping the nation.
125760	129040	Food Witch, now with extra flavor.
129040	131680	What flavor? I'll never tell.
131680	133440	Try one and find out.
133440	135600	Food Witch, it's edible.
135600	137520	Brought to you by Bar Corp.
137520	140800	The only magic we make is the illusion of choice.
141600	144640	Well, hello, Mr. De Wind.
144640	152560	The only processed foods I want are the ones that have been processed by the stew of garbage juice.
152560	156480	And by processed, I mean mostly rotted.
156480	160000	Maybe add a little MSG and sugar to it.
160000	162960	But I'd be willing to try some Food Witch,
162960	166800	if you'd be willing to send me a couple of dumpsters full of them.
166800	170400	I just need that fresh from the dumpster flavor.
170400	173280	Dumpster to table cuisine, babies.
173280	174000	What's that?
174000	178400	You want the opportunity to write up a message for a Wolfie to Hal?
178400	180240	It's so easy.
180960	186000	Just write something nice about us on the internet and tag at PretendingPod.
186000	186720	What's that?
186720	189840	You don't follow us on Instagram or Twitter?
189840	190880	What the fuck?
191840	199440	We post cool shit on there like maps and fan art and pics of Zach's adorable cats Ramona and RoPo.
199440	200560	What's that?
200560	207520	You've listened to over 60 episodes of the show and you still haven't written a five-star review on Apple Podcasts?
207520	209280	That's wild, my babies.
209280	213440	I'm talking to the vast majority of you, but on the real.
213440	214880	Thanks for listening, y'all.
214880	219280	I fucking love making this show just for you.
219280	220240	And guess what?
220240	231920	All five of those pretending to be people stinkers are going to be on Twitch for a night of goofy buffoonery on Tuesday, February 11th at 7 p.m. Central Time.
231920	236240	That's twitch.tv slash pretending pod streams.
236240	239440	Find a link in these here show notes.
239440	243760	Tuesday, February 11th at 7 p.m. Central Time.
243760	246160	Who knows what they'll get up to?
246160	247920	Maybe some Jackbox?
247920	249520	There's only five of them.
249520	252480	Leave some room for y'all to hop in on the action.
252480	255040	Oh, that's going to be fun.
255040	258320	OK, y'all, I got good news and bad news.
258320	259200	Just kidding.
259200	261440	I'm all out of good news.
261440	269360	Last time, our intrepid assholes made their way across campus to Glass Hall, where the biology lab is located.
269360	280080	On the way, they saw unmarked black helicopters in the sky, as well as a couple of goners who were performing some stomach turning acts nasty.
280080	282720	And that ain't wolf the dog nasty.
282720	287360	They made it down to the basement of Glass Hall right outside the lab.
287360	289040	But they're fucking losing it.
289040	292160	And Clark Clark started chanting.
292160	296400	Let's give him something with a little rhythm to spice up that towel.
296400	322800	Well, hey there, Joe.
322800	324560	Hey, Zachariah.
324560	327280	Did anything happen at the end of last episode?
327280	328400	No, I don't think so.
328400	329360	No, nothing important?
329360	330080	Nothing I remember.
330080	331520	That makes a lot of sense.
331520	335680	What I remember is that you lost your fucking mind.
335680	341680	Zero Sand started chanting and then took a big ass finger bump out of Keith's cocaine finger.
342560	342800	Yup.
343840	345920	So what are you expecting for this evening?
345920	350320	I brought my Nintendo Switch because I think I'm going to be not in this episode much at all time.
352960	354080	What are you going to play?
354080	355920	I got Stardew Valley over there.
355920	358240	I never played it before and I've heard it's real addicting.
358240	359760	Is it like Star Wars?
359760	360480	I don't know what...
360480	361360	No, you farm.
361920	362720	You're a farmer.
362720	367040	So it's like what Star Wars would have been about if Ben Kenobi would have never shown up.
367040	367440	Exactly.
367440	368720	If Luke had just stayed on the farm.
370560	376400	Well, what we're going to do is I'm going to give you your objective for the evening.
376960	378480	And we'll start with that.
378480	383360	So first off, you are going to be chanting when we begin.
383360	386160	When everyone comes back in the room all together.
386160	386720	Okay.
386720	390480	So go ahead and just give me like a little example of what that might sound like.
390480	393360	Remember it's towel alacle.
393360	394400	Towel alacle.
394400	394720	Yeah.
394720	395360	That's what it is.
395360	395840	Yeah.
395840	396800	Towel alacle.
397520	398240	Am I doing it right?
398240	399520	Towel alacle.
399520	399840	Yeah.
399840	400000	Yeah.
403360	407200	And then you don't have to do that the whole time because that would be annoying.
407200	408400	And I can just do that in post.
408400	409040	You can lay it in.
409040	409280	Yeah.
410080	411680	So we'll get a clean take of that.
411680	413200	Actually, let's get a clean take of it now.
415840	416800	Oh, a clean take.
416800	418000	A clean take.
418000	418480	Yeah.
418480	420720	As opposed to what you were wanting to do there.
422960	424160	Towel alacle.
424160	425440	Towel alacle.
425440	426880	Towel alacle.
426880	427920	Towel alacle.
427920	428640	Perfect.
429280	432160	Oh, you make an insane person look good, Joe.
433920	434960	My dad always told me that.
436000	438000	So next I'm going to have you roll a d4.
438960	439520	Okay.
439520	442560	I got a two.
442560	442800	Okay.
443520	449360	You are going to start trying desperately to kill yourself in two rounds.
449360	450960	So let's call it the third round.
450960	456800	So you have two rounds of just chanting and like maybe moving about and kind of finding
456800	458640	what you're going to use to kill yourself.
458640	462400	And then on that third round, you're going to go ahead and really try to make that a
462400	464080	reality by going through with it.
464960	465280	Okay.
466640	467920	But I have to do it.
467920	468720	You have to do it.
468720	472400	But I mean like, what happens if I get to the third round and I haven't like prepared
472400	474640	well enough, is there a penalty or something?
474640	475440	How does that work?
475440	478800	Because theoretically the guys are going to hopefully try to stop me from doing something.
478800	479520	Exactly.
480160	481920	So just do your best.
481920	486400	And then if you can't do to them, good on them.
486400	491200	However, if you can't not do to them, I'm going to force your hand.
491200	491440	Sure.
493200	495680	Or just, you know, I'd prefer that you do it.
496960	497200	Yeah.
498720	499840	Thanks for giving me agency.
499840	500560	Exactly.
501520	508560	I'm giving you the full reign of motion, full range of motion, but you have to kill yourself.
508560	508960	Yeah.
508960	509520	No problem.
509520	513200	I've never said that to anyone before and I don't like the way it feels in my mouth.
513200	514240	No, I don't care for it.
515120	517920	They're going to use this recording in my trial.
517920	519120	I fucking know it.
519120	520320	Oh, God damn it.
521280	521680	Okay.
521680	525440	So with that all being said, are you ready?
525440	527680	I assume I need to be cagey with the fellas, right?
527680	528480	I believe so.
529360	532320	Is it possible for Clark to speak other than tell a local at this point?
532320	533040	Not at this point.
533040	533840	Okay, cool.
533840	534480	Uh, okay.
534480	535120	We'll see what happens.
535120	546320	Here we go.
553840	554560	Oh, Hey Luke.
555280	555760	That's me.
556640	557920	That's my sign.
558560	560080	Is there like a, what's it called?
560080	562480	Sign on call something.
562480	562640	Yeah.
562640	565840	It's called a sign on call or something or something.
565840	566560	What's up, man?
566560	567600	An image.
567600	570080	You did something at the end of the last episode, didn't you?
570080	570640	I did.
570640	572080	You busted something out.
572080	576880	I busted some lines like a poet.
576880	577440	Yes.
577440	578560	Like a beat.
579120	580800	Like slam poetry.
580800	586160	Cocaine in my brain until I'm insane.
587040	587680	That's pretty good.
588640	589760	Self opinion.
589760	590080	Okay.
593200	594720	So yes, I did.
594720	600480	I've been waiting for a moment to use it and I was like, fuck, this is good as any, I guess.
601520	608080	So there's going to be some positives for using that, but the negative is that you lose 10 luck.
608080	608400	Right.
608400	610000	So you had how much luck?
610000	616160	I had 35 and before you tell me that I have five points, let me say this, because I used
616160	620560	it in succession so quickly, let's call it one.
620560	621040	I agree.
621680	622240	Hell yeah.
622240	624240	So you have 25 luck still.
624240	624880	Tight, tight.
625440	629760	Also using it, I remembered when I first got it, there was a reason that I hadn't used
629760	631920	it, but I forgot what the cost was.
632880	635680	So I was just hoping that it wasn't like something terrible.
635680	637600	So the cost is that 10 luck.
637600	642720	And normally the positive that you would get is that it puts your willpower back up to
642720	643360	full.
643360	648240	However, during this arc, we haven't been using the willpower because I'm still at 10
648240	650800	out of 10 because I forgot about it.
650800	653680	Well, you're such a good GM.
653680	655840	I would, I, you haven't forgot about it.
655840	657520	You just are waiting for the right time.
657520	658400	Exactly.
658400	659920	Thank you for understanding.
660000	665920	So basically what we're going to do is with that, like kick of Coke up in the nostrils,
665920	671680	I will give you a boon later in this episode for using a bonus.
672480	672880	Okay.
672880	673360	Tight.
673360	675760	Same for me and Clark and John.
675760	676480	Absolutely.
676480	677360	Fuck you.
677360	678560	Justin's character.
678560	679920	Donovan West.
679920	681520	Why can't we remember that?
681520	683360	You don't even remember his last name, do you?
683360	688480	West view, West Haven, West Haven, something like that.
688480	688880	Sorry.
688880	689040	Sorry.
689520	690400	Sorry, Justin.
691200	693200	We'll care about your next character.
693200	702400	So just a reminder, before we get into tonight's episode, you have a pile of money in your
702400	704640	pockets and at your feet.
704640	705680	And you're very excited.
705680	707120	I'm so excited.
707120	708240	I'm giving away my drugs.
708240	708560	I'm sorry.
708560	709600	Cause I can buy more.
709600	710480	Exactly.
710480	710800	All right.
710800	713360	Let's get the other boys in here and kick this thing off.
719040	731120	What's the loudest fart you've ever heard?
731120	732000	I don't know.
732000	733120	Nothing really sticks out.
733120	733440	It does.
733440	734400	Nothing has to stick out.
735760	737040	It could just be a fart.
737040	737600	What about you?
738480	739040	I don't know.
739040	740160	That's a weird thing to remember.
740160	741280	Why would anybody remember that?
741280	742080	That's what I'm thinking.
742720	745440	Has anyone had any weird dreams recently?
745440	745920	Thomas?
747040	747200	Yeah.
747840	753520	As a matter of fact, I was just telling some close friends about this weird dream.
753520	755440	I had in our pre-interview.
758560	759360	Is that what they're called?
761760	768960	You really should start treating us like, like, so, uh, you got anything from your life?
768960	770160	Any anecdotes you want to tell?
770160	772480	If not, some of our writers can punch something up for you.
773920	775920	No, but I did have a really weird dream.
776560	781920	Probably doesn't mean anything, but I, a doctor told me to cut off my penis.
783200	783920	Here's the deal.
783920	785520	I was like, Oh, I had this dream.
785520	789280	I went into the doctor because I was having like, I was like, I think there's something
789280	790160	wrong with my penis.
790720	794560	And the doctor's like, yeah, but it's common.
794560	795920	I'm really busy.
795920	796880	Here's some snips.
797440	803040	You're going to cut off the end of your penis, the head and some of the shaft.
803040	804880	Good to use all the scientific terms.
805600	806320	He didn't.
806320	809440	He just like, this is, um, he pointed at it.
809440	811120	He actually said ding dong.
811760	814320	He said, ding dong, but he's the Latin.
815840	817200	He's like, yeah, I don't have time.
817200	822800	You've got to cut off the tip of your penis, put it in this plastic bag and, uh, carry
822800	824880	it around until your appointment tomorrow.
825680	827840	So he made me do that myself.
828640	833440	And as I was logging out the door, he's like, by the way, by the way, don't pee for 24 hours.
833520	834560	And I was like, fuck.
836480	841600	So I probably just had to pee because the rest of the dream was me managing, like just
841600	842720	running into people in life.
842720	844960	And they're like, wait, why do you have your penis in a bag?
845600	848480	And then also I just had this like open penis sore.
851600	854480	And then I really had to pee and I was like, he told me not to.
854480	856480	I was like, but I can probably get away with it.
856480	863600	So I peed and just like blood and piss came out, but there was no like pee muscles.
863600	864800	It was just an open hole.
864800	866720	So it just kind of sprayed everywhere.
868320	873200	I like when you put your thumb over a hose, I thought you were going to say when you put
873200	878000	your thumb over the tip of your penis, just to make the stream stronger.
878960	884400	Well, when you're rinsing off like some chicken grease or something, you got to really some
884480	886000	chicken grease from where?
886000	886880	You know where.
886880	891040	Speaking of taking home stuff from the hospital, Luke, have you seen anything interesting on
891040	892000	Reddit recently?
892000	893360	Well, I saw it on Facebook.
894080	896000	A friend shared it to another friend.
896000	897440	Way to turn your back on me.
898880	899200	What?
899200	901920	Just say you saw it on Reddit because that's what I asked, Luke.
901920	903280	All right, I saw it on Reddit.
904240	906720	A guy in Oklahoma got in a motorcycle crash.
906720	907840	You're a liar, Luke.
909520	912400	He crushed his foot and so they had to amputate it.
912480	918560	Then he asked if he could keep it and he did and then he fed it to his friends in the form
918560	919200	of tacos.
920560	923680	He didn't feed it to his friends.
923680	925200	He had a dinner party.
925200	927120	He had a dinner party with tacos.
927120	928480	Yeah, feet tacos.
928480	929200	Foot meat.
929200	930560	Inspired by our podcast.
931680	934080	Oh shit, I didn't even make that connection.
934720	935200	Wow.
935200	942160	So we want to shout out to our officially number one superfan out there in Oklahoma.
942400	942880	You get it.
943600	944320	He gets it.
944320	945600	Hopping around just like Keith.
946240	947200	I also had a dream.
948000	949200	Wait, no, no, no, no.
949200	953680	Far more interested in whether or not you would eat your own flesh if you had the opportunity.
953680	955600	Honestly, when else are you going to get that chance?
956240	956800	Sure.
956800	958240	I would ask you guys.
958240	961760	I wouldn't be mad if you said no, but I'd be appreciative if you did.
961760	962160	You know what?
962160	963920	I would eat me, but I would not eat you.
964800	967200	I would eat me, but I don't think I'd eat foot.
967200	970400	Like if I lost my leg, I think I'd eat some calf meat.
970400	971600	You can't really be picky.
973120	975360	That's what, no, I think cannibals can't be choosers.
975360	977520	I think I actually can in this instance.
977520	984720	I'm going to choose not to eat any part of myself unless it's the right part.
984720	989600	Honestly, you should have, instead of getting your penis tip reattached, just fed it to us.
989600	993120	Well, I woke up before the penis actually got reattached.
993120	998240	So there's a possibility that in some alternate reality where Thomas got like 30 more minutes
998240	1001680	of sleep, you all got to enjoy my dream penis.
1002480	1007600	My dream penis, which is what I call my penis in real life.
1009440	1012320	You don't have to detach it yet for us to enjoy it.
1015440	1024160	Anyway, so you should start with Luke telling his story and completely cut out the part
1024160	1029520	where I talk about the dick cutting off dream and just let them decide what that's all about.
1030880	1031440	I won't.
1031520	1034560	So you guys are all in the basement of glass hall.
1037200	1038240	Your penis?
1038240	1041440	Dude, it goes on for like three and a half minutes.
1041440	1043280	It depends on the mode of...
1043280	1046560	So you guys are all in the basement of glass hall, right outside the lab.
1046560	1052160	And you have recently walked down some stairs that were covered in blood with loose screwdrivers,
1052160	1058960	all strewn about on the stairwell leading down into the hallway that the lab is in.
1058960	1061520	The lab's just up here on your right, as Donovan might say.
1061520	1062800	Donovan, what's your last name?
1062800	1063920	I'll let you guess.
1063920	1064420	Elizabeth.
1065600	1066240	View?
1066240	1066800	West Haven.
1067360	1068560	You had it right earlier.
1068560	1069920	I said it right earlier.
1069920	1071280	And then I told him, I don't think that's it.
1071280	1072720	Have you never written it down?
1073680	1076480	It's probably written down like eight times somewhere.
1076480	1077520	Did he make it up?
1079120	1080240	Yeah, who made the character name?
1080240	1082880	Did you get to make your name up, Justin, or did he give you your name?
1082880	1084000	I didn't give him his name.
1084000	1084480	Okay.
1084480	1085840	Zach doesn't tell me to do shit.
1086640	1087440	Hey, that's right.
1087600	1091440	Zach was like, if you want to spoil all the story stuff, go for it.
1091440	1092480	That's essentially what I said.
1092480	1093920	But I can't, because I don't know what's happening.
1096000	1100800	Zach's told you at length what was going on in the campaign, but it was just too boring.
1103760	1104720	Didn't pay attention.
1104720	1105600	Cool story, Zach.
1106720	1107200	Ouch.
1107200	1110400	That was Justin saying that in the past when you told him that story.
1110400	1111760	I was like, good job, Zach.
1111760	1112640	I love you.
1112640	1115040	But he said it really sarcastically, so it hurt worse.
1115680	1118160	Than if you'd said cool story.
1118880	1120240	Good job, Zach.
1120240	1121040	I love you.
1122480	1125600	And he's just holding up his fingers crossed right in front of Zach's face.
1127920	1129120	Oh my God.
1129680	1136400	Dude, the way you held your hand annoyingly in front of a face just looks like you have
1136400	1137680	way too much practice.
1139360	1140160	I love you, mom.
1143360	1144240	I do love my mom.
1146000	1146800	I love this mom.
1147760	1148880	You guys are standing there.
1148880	1154880	Keith Vigna is shoving bloody screwdrivers into his pants pockets.
1154880	1162080	Donovan is just staring in confusion and amazement and horrifying revelation that
1162080	1167600	maybe you're not with the best people as Keith just puts his finger up the nose of Clark
1167600	1172240	Bishop and then puts his finger up the nose of John Lee Pettymore.
1172800	1173600	And then...
1173600	1176000	Joe, is this the first time Clark's done cooking?
1176000	1176960	Uh, yeah.
1176960	1179280	Unless I did it for some reason earlier in the podcast.
1179280	1179760	Definitely.
1179760	1180880	You definitely did not.
1180880	1182160	Yeah, definitely.
1182160	1183280	Before he starts chanting.
1183280	1184080	What's that like for...
1184800	1186480	So you got to one sanity, right?
1186480	1187040	Zero.
1187040	1187760	Zero.
1187760	1189280	So Clark's just gone.
1189280	1189920	Yeah.
1189920	1190240	Okay.
1192320	1192800	That's sad.
1193840	1196240	Clark still doesn't know what it's like to do cooking.
1198240	1200000	The vessel formerly known as Clark.
1202400	1203440	Towel alico.
1203440	1204720	Towel alico.
1204720	1206160	Towel alico.
1206160	1207360	Towel alico.
1207360	1210800	I guess we got to shoot them to be consistent.
1218720	1224480	The lights in glass hall all go out at the exact same time and you are left with just
1224480	1226400	the red emergency lights.
1227120	1227600	Do the thing.
1229280	1230880	The red emergency lights.
1233040	1235040	The lighting, the hallway that you're in and the lab...
1235040	1236080	You guys know what happened.
1236960	1237920	Who told you about this?
1237920	1240960	I made the room red because Thomas reminded me.
1241920	1242880	Red room.
1242880	1243440	Red room.
1244480	1248720	And you guys see you're standing in front of this lab that is completely just like a
1248720	1255200	wall of glass, like looking into this laboratory and you hear the doors that you just came
1255200	1261120	in the entrance to glass hall bust open and you hear a bunch of chatter from up there.
1261200	1262080	Go, go, go.
1265040	1271040	And you hear a voice of an older woman say, oh my God, I just got to get you as many
1271040	1272800	presents as I possibly can get.
1275760	1276320	Go, go.
1276320	1277040	We got another.
1277040	1277680	Clear, clear.
1281280	1283520	And we are in combat round.
1283520	1284960	Clark Bishop, you're up first.
1284960	1285680	You're chanting.
1285680	1287120	What do you do while you're chanting?
1287120	1291120	I think we ended with my hand out asking if I could help carry the screwdrivers.
1291120	1293120	If he was handing me one, I'm taking it.
1293120	1296480	Otherwise I'm reaching down to the body that had those screwdrivers hanging out of it and
1296480	1296960	grabbing one.
1296960	1298240	Yeah, I'm offering him one.
1298240	1299600	Then I'll grab it out of his hand.
1299600	1300720	John Lee Pettymore, you're up.
1300720	1300960	Okay.
1300960	1307200	So John Lee Pettymore, he's walking towards Clark, but you can tell that he thinks he's
1307200	1308560	floating, if that makes any sense.
1308560	1309920	He's making these little tippy taps.
1309920	1319200	And he's just going to try to like grab Clark and move him into the lab and like hide with
1319200	1319360	him.
1319360	1320720	Chris angel style.
1320720	1325360	Yeah, but our arms, like he's T posing, but doing little T tippy taps as he has his arms
1325360	1326320	like stretched out.
1326960	1329680	Clark, my child come, we must get you to safety.
1329680	1330560	Keith Vigna.
1330560	1332160	Do I see people coming down the stairs?
1332160	1337280	When you look back up the stairs, you see the small ugly child that you saw before clean.
1337280	1339840	He's wearing a backpack and cleaning the baseboards.
1340640	1342880	Ferocity with ferocity.
1342880	1344960	That's a word I made up last time.
1344960	1356480	It means, uh, with the, uh, the very intensely and good and, and, and he's like eating that.
1356480	1358400	Now I don't remember this.
1358400	1360080	I don't remember that word.
1360640	1362160	You might not have been conscious.
1362160	1362400	Yeah.
1362400	1363200	I don't remember it either.
1363200	1364080	So I might not have been.
1364080	1364880	Yeah, that makes sense.
1364880	1365120	Okay.
1365120	1367520	Um, why is there a kid at college?
1367520	1369840	I hear the yelling and stuff.
1369840	1375840	If I only just see that kid and nobody else, I'm going to keep getting screwdrivers, just
1375840	1378000	stuff in my pockets and Donovan Westhaven.
1378000	1378800	What are you doing?
1378800	1382480	Is there a, is there a combat move called panic while not moving?
1385440	1386080	Can I roll?
1386800	1390880	And Leon Simpson just keeps dancing and grinding, just moving and grooving.
1390880	1396160	Hey, Hey, you gotta get down to the flow and he's just grinding up on it.
1396160	1403680	And then you guys hear from upstairs, you hear, you hear a clink, clink, clink, and
1403680	1409520	looking up the stairs, you see a small canister and gas starts emitting out of it.
1409520	1413040	And it's right next to this kid cleaning the baseboards with that.
1413040	1416960	It's Clark Bishop's turn and you are being moved into the lab currently.
1416960	1417600	What are you doing?
1417600	1418800	John's just pushing you.
1418800	1420640	You guys can simultaneously here.
1420640	1425120	If you're just pushing me, I'm not going with the push and I'm going to the opposite
1425120	1430480	wall from the glass walls to the cinder block wall and trying to rub the screwdrivers
1430480	1432960	head really hard to kind of sharpen the tip of it.
1432960	1433360	Okay.
1433360	1436240	So if you want him to not do that, we're going to roll a strength.
1436240	1438240	No, I, I, I abandoned.
1438240	1440880	I like throw my hands up cause I'm not getting anywhere with him.
1441440	1446080	And I pick up a pile of screwdrivers from the floor and I wave them.
1446080	1449280	Look, look, look, look, shiny, shiny screwdrivers.
1449280	1452480	And I throw them like in front of the door for the lab.
1452480	1454240	Make it rain, brother.
1454240	1455280	Hell yeah.
1455280	1456000	Make it rain.
1456000	1456720	I like that.
1456720	1457920	Those were the best ones.
1457920	1458960	Those were the best ones.
1458960	1459840	They're all good.
1459840	1461520	They all worth the same amount.
1461520	1463360	There was a, there was one that was worth more.
1464320	1465520	Not what I'm seeing.
1465520	1467120	It said, it said on there.
1467120	1468880	Very good screwdriver.
1468880	1470160	Better than the rest.
1470160	1471840	I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
1471840	1472800	But, uh, fuck.
1473440	1475280	Why are you rubbing that up against the wall?
1475840	1477840	Double elical, double elical.
1477840	1480960	Uh, I see that has the, the canister has started emitting.
1480960	1481760	It's on the stairs.
1481760	1482000	Yeah.
1482000	1482880	And it's going off.
1482880	1484480	Smoke hasn't made it down here yet though.
1484480	1486080	Is the lab open?
1486080	1488960	The door is closed, but it is just a push.
1488960	1490240	It's not like a lock.
1490240	1491680	I see the gas coming out.
1491680	1499200	I take a one last, like handful of screwdrivers, shoving my pockets and I head towards the door,
1499200	1501040	try to open it up and go in that room.
1501040	1501360	Okay.
1501360	1501840	Sounds good.
1501840	1503360	You'll be in there at the start of next round.
1503360	1505200	Donovan West Haven.
1505200	1510080	I am going to follow Keith and just cause like, I'm like, it's better than staying right here.
1510080	1510800	Absolutely.
1510800	1517440	And Leon Simpson is going to continue just moving, grinding, bumping, bopping, duping,
1517440	1518800	dipin' and dopin'.
1518800	1524880	And at that moment you see legs, just legs, and then torsos.
1526240	1534240	A squad of four men dressed in black tactical gear with flashlights at the tips of their
1534240	1535600	submachine guns.
1535600	1542080	And they each have a canister in their hands and you hear, oh, we got a bunch down here.
1542080	1543360	We got a bunch down here.
1543360	1544880	Get go, get go, get go.
1545760	1547600	Ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, ting.
1547600	1551760	And four canisters roll right next to you guys in the hallway outside the lab.
1551760	1551920	And...
1556320	1559280	Joe, if you could hit that vape real hard and just blow it around here and get some
1559280	1562560	smoke in the room, really make it, really make it real for us.
1562560	1563600	Fatter, fatter.
1563600	1564720	Oh, we need those clouds.
1564720	1565520	Get that rip.
1565520	1566800	Oh shit.
1566800	1568000	That was actually really fat.
1570720	1576080	It's like I'm looking into the sky on a beautiful summer's day.
1580480	1583040	Thomas, what if you got popcorn lung just from that one hit?
1584160	1585280	I'd haunt you all.
1587280	1590000	We'd all talk like every time you were haunting us, we'd be like...
1592240	1593760	No, that's what I would do.
1593840	1595120	Every night while you tried to sleep.
1596240	1598080	Just behind your head.
1598080	1604320	Clark Bishop, it is the top of the third round and you have a sharp screwdriver in your hand.
1604320	1604820	What do you do?
1605680	1609200	He kind of looks around and gives a smile to everyone around
1610000	1615200	and jams the pick into his eye and up through the top of his head.
1616160	1623760	Clark's chanting ceases as he shoves this sharpened screwdriver into the white of his eye
1624400	1628320	and blood begins dripping down his face.
1628960	1634960	But with one last staccato motion, he shoves the handle of the screwdriver
1634960	1643360	flush with his eye socket and a stream of warm dark red blood sprays into the air as
1643360	1653600	each of his limbs go limp and the body of Clark Bishop crumbles into a pile on the floor.
1655920	1656640	So it's my turn.
1663840	1664960	It is your turn?
1664960	1666960	I'd like to load our autosave.
1671040	1672720	Wait, could I have done that, Zach?
1672720	1674480	We turned autosave off and we...
1674480	1676480	Oh, come on, we're on survival mode?
1677200	1678560	Are we going for achievements?
1678560	1683680	I think we were fighting the fishmen the last time we actually saved.
1683680	1684960	Well, listeners.
1688880	1694240	You all walk into a dank, dark room the size of a football field and you see
1695280	1696320	catwalks going...
1696320	1698000	No, I quit the podcast.
1698320	1698820	Yeah.
1700960	1703520	Joe, Clark is dead.
1705360	1706240	Long live Clark.
1706240	1707040	Long live Clark.
1708800	1710080	Get the fuck out of the room.
1710080	1710960	Good luck, fellas.
1711520	1713120	Your hair looks pretty crazy right now.
1714000	1714560	Wait, wait, wait.
1714560	1716880	Can Joe just lay down on the ground right now?
1718400	1719840	Make gurgling sounds.
1719840	1720720	Joe, be a dead...
1720720	1721840	Oh, roleplay a dead guy.
1722560	1723440	Can we eat your foot?
1728080	1728560	I'm at it.
1744160	1745760	John Lee Pettymore, it's your turn.
1745760	1750320	You just saw Clark Bishop stab himself in the eye with a screwdriver and fall limply
1750320	1751280	dead to the ground.
1751280	1755920	Yeah, and you see that affect real John just very briefly.
1755920	1758960	Like a flash in his eyes before he...
1758960	1761920	Well, that's real handy because I'm going to have you all roll sanity for me.
1766400	1768560	Oh, I passed 16 on a 19.
1768560	1769760	Oh my God.
1769760	1773440	The only reason I passed or the only reason I rolled is because it's my friend.
1775840	1778240	If it was anybody else, I'd be like, I don't give a fuck.
1779840	1781120	I got a 99.
1781920	1784480	Oh, God fuck.
1784480	1788720	Which is the crittest of fails, except for 100.
1788720	1789680	Except for 100.
1790320	1794000	Hey, Thomas, you're going to lose four sanity.
1794000	1795680	Well, that's all I got.
1795680	1798080	Yeah, no more sanity for John Lee Pettymore.
1798960	1802640	Okay, I need Donovan to roll a d4 for me.
1803840	1804480	Oh, there it is.
1806720	1807120	One.
1807120	1807620	Nice.
1808000	1812560	So as you lose one sanity, you're still going to be able to keep your wits about you for
1812560	1815520	the time being as fucked up as that seems.
1816320	1817280	Not too rattled on.
1817280	1819280	You don't really know this guy that well.
1819280	1822800	With that, though, I'm going to have Luke and Justin leave the room.
1826480	1828400	You guys could just stay here.
1828400	1830160	He's not like a cop or anything.
1831600	1832640	Can you stop me, sir?
1832640	1833680	What are you going to do about it?
1833680	1834480	Don't leave.
1834480	1846320	Wait, you listen to cops.
1850960	1853760	As soon as they come back in the room, you're going to start chanting.
1853760	1855280	Can you teach me how to chant again?
1855280	1856880	A towel.
1856880	1857840	Towel.
1857840	1858800	Alakol.
1858800	1859520	Alakol.
1859520	1860720	Towel alakol.
1860720	1860960	Yes.
1860960	1862000	Towel alakol.
1862000	1863920	And I need you to roll a d4 for me.
1864960	1865440	Three.
1865440	1872800	You are going to start working on finding a way to kill yourself over the next three
1872800	1873440	rounds.
1873440	1875120	I mean, I think I just have a gun, right?
1875120	1875680	Yep.
1875680	1879200	And on the fourth round, you have to go through with it.
1879200	1880800	Can I go through with it before that?
1880800	1881440	You cannot.
1881440	1882320	Oh, okay.
1882320	1886320	I have to give them a chance to realize what's going on like we didn't with Joe?
1886320	1887600	That is correct.
1887600	1888100	Okay.
1889920	1891360	I'll get the other boys back in here.
1894480	1907280	Okay.
1907280	1910080	John Lee Pennymore walks straight back to the corner.
1910080	1911840	He's still doing the tippy tap thing.
1911840	1917200	Like he thinks he's floating with his face to the corner of the back wall of the slab
1917200	1918320	and his arms outstretched.
1918320	1919040	He starts saying.
1919680	1920960	Towel alakol.
1920960	1922160	Towel alakol.
1922160	1923440	Towel alakol.
1923440	1924240	Towel alakol.
1924240	1929200	And you guys notice as you, as you get into this lab, you're just paying so much attention
1929200	1935200	to John as he walks away from you and starts chanting this that you barely notice the woman
1935200	1940960	and the lab coat or the man and the lab coat sitting at a desk faced away from you.
1940960	1942000	Are there two people?
1942000	1946160	Two people, one man, one woman, both wearing lab coats and the woman looks at you and it's
1946160	1947600	like, oh my goodness.
1947600	1952880	Oh, oh, thank God someone came except for he's doing the, he's doing the chanting and
1952880	1953760	he is he.
1953840	1959120	She looks at Keith Vigna and Donovan Westhaven and it's like, do you know how to fix him?
1959120	1964320	I like briefly look at her and then I look down, I get down on my knees and I start pulling
1964320	1969760	all of the stuff out of my pockets and I start counting it with a huge smile on my face.
1969760	1970720	Donovan, what are you doing?
1970720	1974160	I don't understand the, to the, the woman who's talking, what about the man?
1974160	1975840	Is he also looking at us or?
1975840	1980080	No, he's faced away from you and he's bent over a desk, kind of like slumped over.
1981040	1986560	Okay, well, I'll acknowledge the person who's acknowledged me as is Donovan's way.
1986560	1988080	I don't, I don't understand what's happening.
1988080	1992960	These, these people, they've all started going crazy and I don't know what's happening.
1992960	1994720	Everyone all over the campus is going crazy.
1994720	1998160	And they've all been committing suicide after they started going crazy.
1999280	2000960	I'm trying to count here.
2003120	2004720	Why is he counting screwdrivers?
2004720	2005600	I don't, I don't know.
2005600	2007600	He just started doing this minutes ago.
2007680	2011840	And then you guys look out and through the glass, you see into the hallway
2011840	2016720	filled with smoke and bathed in red emergency bulbs.
2016720	2023600	Through the gas, you see the beams from four flashlights attached to the barrels of this
2023600	2025680	four man squad's rifles.
2025680	2033040	The hazy gleam illuminates the screwdriver filled old woman and the body of Clark Bishop
2033040	2040640	before all four rifles are pointed at Leon Simpson, who has ceased to dance.
2040640	2055280	And you hear and then, and then he falls over without doing anything.
2056240	2057680	He's just standing there chanting.
2058240	2060800	And then he falls over clear.
2060800	2061840	We got more in the lab.
2063360	2064000	On the right.
2065120	2067680	It is John Lee Pettymore's turn.
2067680	2072320	John turns around from the wall and looks at the door and draws his gun.
2073040	2074160	And that's his turn.
2074160	2074800	Keith Vigna.
2074800	2078720	As I'm counting, I like look over my shoulder through the glass.
2078720	2080800	I see Leon fall down.
2080800	2081760	What else do I see?
2081760	2088080	These guys, they move in and they're all wearing this like full tactical gear from
2088080	2095760	combat boots all the way up to a gas mask, big goggles on the gas masks and helmets on top.
2095760	2098000	Just some straight Resident Evil motherfuckers.
2098000	2102640	I position myself to wear my pile of goodies.
2103360	2105280	Like it's me, my pile of goodies.
2105280	2110800	And then I have clear sight of the door looking at them, but also just continue counting.
2110800	2112000	What's your name, sir?
2112000	2112480	Donovan.
2112480	2113440	Donovan Westhaven.
2113440	2114160	I go here.
2114160	2116720	Are you the only one about them who's got the wits?
2116720	2117600	I think so.
2117600	2121600	I don't know why, but I haven't been infected with whatever's happening.
2121600	2122320	I'm Barbara.
2122320	2123120	This is Phillip.
2123120	2129360	And she points at the man who slumped over behind her and she's like, we are also fine.
2129360	2132240	Everyone's going crazy around us and we're just fine.
2132240	2135680	That's a relief that there's, it's not just me that's safe.
2135680	2136640	Yes, absolutely.
2136640	2139520	But I mean, you've seen it all from the beginning, ain't you?
2139520	2140240	I guess I have.
2140240	2145040	I just, I thought there was some like weird campus prank or something in the beginning.
2145040	2146400	And now it's freaky.
2146400	2151200	It's it's I don't, I don't, he doesn't know how to find the words to describe the terrors
2151200	2152560	that he is experiencing.
2152560	2154800	When he's, he's like stammering and finishes.
2154800	2156320	I look over my shoulder at him.
2156320	2160320	I'm like, I think they sent the tweets and then I continue doing what I'm doing.
2160320	2160960	Oh yes.
2160960	2162880	Yes, I did send those tweets.
2162880	2165520	Yes, me and me and Phillip both sent those tweets.
2165520	2168640	And Phillip, tell them, tell them what you told me earlier.
2170160	2170960	Dead silence.
2170960	2175840	And then she's like, Phillip, you have such a wit about you.
2176400	2177120	Fuck.
2177120	2181200	Like, he's so like, he's like, Oh God, I'm literally the only sane person right now.
2181200	2181840	I look over at her.
2181840	2183760	I'm like, did you guys leave this outside?
2184880	2186400	Did you leave all this outside?
2186400	2189280	Oh, and I, I wave, I wave one around.
2189280	2193120	Barbara looks back up to Donovan and she's like, why is he doing that?
2193120	2193760	I don't know.
2193760	2196560	I mean, I guess there's no reason for any of this anymore.
2196560	2198400	I suppose it's just more for me then.
2199360	2200080	Oh, crazy.
2201040	2204080	I think, I think we need, is John still chanting?
2208720	2212160	I think we need to, can we, can you help me restrain him?
2212160	2212480	Yes.
2212480	2213440	Yes, of course.
2213440	2215840	I'm like walking towards, do I even know John's name?
2216720	2218560	Oh God, sir.
2218560	2220080	I just know Clark and Leon.
2220080	2221120	Yeah, probably not.
2221120	2226000	So I'll let you guys roll a, uh, if, if John, uh, doesn't want to be.
2226000	2228320	John will contest it, whatever you do.
2228320	2232000	Okay, so you'll get a strength check and I'll give you, because there are two of us doing
2232000	2236640	it, even though we're probably not as strong as John Lee Pettymore is, I'll give you a
2236640	2239600	70 strength with two people working together.
2239600	2241440	So it's a blackjack rules.
2241440	2244160	So you want to roll as high as possible without going over.
2244160	2245040	Price is right rules.
2245040	2246000	John's got a 50.
2246000	2246800	What did I say?
2246800	2247760	Blackjack.
2247760	2248320	Oh yeah.
2248320	2249120	Price is right.
2249120	2249920	Makes way more sense.
2249920	2252240	Well, you always want to hit that big roll in blackjack.
2253200	2254000	Okay, come on.
2254000	2255760	Spay and neuter those pets, Justin.
2261040	2261540	Fuck.
2262240	2263040	I fucked up too.
2263040	2264160	So I got a 14.
2264160	2265280	I got a five.
2265280	2265780	Yeah.
2268240	2268740	Yes.
2269520	2269760	Okay.
2269760	2273920	So as Barbara and Donovan come toward John Lee Pettymore, what does John Lee Pettymore
2273920	2274320	do?
2274320	2277680	Oh, he just like, he very smoothly just like wiles away.
2278640	2280880	He just kind of like waves his arms and he's gone.
2280880	2281760	He's so slippery.
2282560	2289120	And it's John Lee Pettymore's turn as these four men point their flashlights into the
2289120	2293440	lab through the glass door and are clearly preparing an entrance.
2293440	2301840	John Lee Pettymore points his service revolver at his chin and he says, God is dead.
2302800	2305840	God remains dead and we have killed him.
2307280	2308720	And it's Keith Vigna's turn.
2308720	2312240	I look over my shoulder and I see them getting ready to come in.
2312240	2317520	I grab an arm full of what I've been counting, trying to get as much as I can.
2317520	2324080	And I run behind the desk, drop it on the ground and then prepare for an assault.
2324640	2330960	I'm going to take my gun out and I want to shoot John Lee Pettymore to stop him from,
2330960	2334800	I'm assuming killing himself because that's all I've seen is people kill themselves.
2334800	2336000	Where are you shooting him?
2336000	2339440	I don't know if Donovan would know better to like, not the head.
2339440	2342400	Yeah, you have a 30% on firearms we dictated.
2342400	2345440	So a called shot would give you a 10% chance.
2345440	2347280	So you're just going to go ahead and fire.
2347280	2348960	I'm just going to shoot him and hope it like
2348960	2351840	knocks him out of shooting himself and disables him.
2351840	2353360	Go ahead and roll that firearms.
2355440	2358480	But can I have a bonus power of love of Clark?
2360160	2361920	The spirit of Clark compels you.
2361920	2365440	This is for Clark, my new dad.
2366240	2366800	Oh no.
2366800	2367440	Yeah, I'm good.
2368240	2369040	Didn't.
2369040	2369680	87.
2370560	2371200	He's bad.
2371200	2372080	He's not good.
2372080	2374320	You shoot John directly in the head.
2375920	2376640	Oh God.
2376640	2377760	It wasn't a crit fail.
2377760	2383040	So you fire just past him and you're like, the camera zooms, like the camera is looking
2383040	2384560	at your gun as it fires.
2384560	2387200	And then when it zooms up to your face, you've got your eyes closed.
2388640	2389440	That checks out.
2389440	2395120	You see that there's this piece of machinery behind John Lee Pettymore where he's standing
2395920	2401280	and Barbara looks at you and she's like, that happened to be the machinery we were going
2401280	2405440	to use to try to create some sort of antivirus for whatever's happening here.
2405440	2405840	Oh God.
2405840	2407760	I'm so, I'm so sorry.
2407760	2412720	And then she turns to Phillip and she's like, Phillip, I just don't think that we're going
2412720	2414480	to be able to make it through this.
2414480	2420240	And she puts her hand on Phillip's shoulder and as she does, she kind of like pushes him
2420240	2424880	a little bit and the rolly chair that he's in rolls, like spins around.
2424880	2434080	And you see that this man has no eyes and there's blood just running down from his eye
2434080	2435120	holes.
2435120	2443440	And in each one of his hands, he is holding his own eyeballs, stringy mucus hanging off
2443440	2447440	the end of each one limply in both of his dead hands.
2447440	2448880	So you're like Pan's Labyrinth.
2449600	2450720	Yeah, exactly.
2450720	2452400	But grosser somehow.
2452400	2454080	Oh, much grosser.
2454080	2461360	And at that moment, the door gets kicked in and you hear, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
2461360	2465760	And you hear canisters hit the floor and smoke starts filling the lab.
2466720	2468080	It's John Lee Pettymore's turn.
2468800	2476720	With a look of just complete contentment, it's honestly unnerving.
2477520	2481200	But you've never seen a being more at peace with itself.
2482640	2488320	John Lee Pettymore just looks out at all of you and like smiles and then blows his brains
2488320	2489520	out through the back of his head.
2491920	2493520	I need you both to roll sanity.
2497200	2497700	Pass.
2500960	2502160	He knows we're all ball.
2503440	2504560	I fail.
2504560	2506080	Roll a d4 for me, Luke.
2506080	2511760	Three, which brings me down to 16.
2511760	2512960	Alrighty.
2512960	2519920	Thomas, go ahead and leave the room.
2529200	2532960	John Lee Pettymore falls backwards and hits the ground.
2533760	2537600	And a pool of blood starts forming around his head.
2538720	2540000	And it's Keith Vigna's turn.
2540000	2543680	Well, I hear the gunshot and I turn around to see it.
2547600	2548100	Fuck.
2549680	2555600	And I almost like, I feel like I'm going to throw up, but I keep it down and I look down
2555600	2556640	at what's in front of me.
2557520	2560640	This is all going to his funeral, if I can keep it.
2560640	2561680	And then I look at the door.
2561680	2564480	The smoke is currently coming out of the canisters on the ground in front of you.
2564480	2566640	The next thing I want to do is when they enter the room.
2566640	2567680	Okay, Donovan.
2567680	2573280	Donovan would instinctively like go into like, I'm being arrested mode because he's like,
2573280	2574560	I don't know what the fuck is happening.
2574560	2580960	And everyone he's been following has gone crazy and is either killed themselves or is
2580960	2583520	counting screwdrivers on the floor.
2583520	2586560	He just like gets on his knees and like submits.
2586560	2589760	Like does the hands behind the head, just gets on the knees.
2590400	2592080	Help, I don't know what's happening.
2592080	2592400	Help.
2592400	2597920	I hear him say that and I look over to him like, you got to help me protect this stash.
2597920	2599040	Get up and fight.
2599920	2600480	I do not.
2601760	2607840	I feel betrayed and then I am preparing, but I wait for the entrance of.
2607840	2612800	Yeah, if you're, if you're like holding your turn until something happens, these guys bust
2612800	2615600	into the room all four of them at the same time.
2615600	2618160	From that preparing, like an aim kind of thing.
2618160	2618640	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2618640	2619360	So what do you do?
2619360	2622720	I pick up the objects in front of me, a handful.
2623520	2626160	I like focus in on them.
2626160	2632160	My mind is going a thousand miles an hour from that bump of pure coke.
2632160	2633280	Glass family cocaine.
2633280	2634240	Glass family coke.
2634800	2636800	Focus in on the four guys.
2636800	2643520	And what Donovan would see is I take a screwdriver in my hand, holding it like a piece of money
2643520	2649680	paper and I like snap it, flick it like I'm throwing a card.
2649680	2650240	Right.
2650240	2655920	And I'm aiming right at the neck between the helmet and the body armor.
2655920	2656480	Sure.
2656480	2659360	And that one exposed piece of skin.
2659360	2659920	Yep.
2659920	2660240	And I.
2662560	2664240	Try to throw a bunch of screwdrivers.
2664240	2671760	Well, I am flicking in my mind, paper money at them, trying to like get it into them.
2671760	2675280	But in reality, I'm throwing screwdrivers into their necks.
2675280	2675600	Okay.
2675600	2683680	So you're going to roll athletics and I will give you a plus 40, 20 for being prepared
2683680	2689280	and 20 for being gacked out and just fully believing that this is possible.
2689280	2691680	And then negative 20 for it being a called shot.
2691680	2693200	So it's a plus 20 overall.
2695200	2696080	And not one.
2696080	2696960	No, you fucking didn't.
2696960	2698080	I fucking swear to you.
2698720	2699040	Seven.
2699600	2701600	It's a seven.
2702320	2703360	Holy shit.
2703360	2704320	God damn it.
2704320	2706880	I thought it was, but I mean, that's still pretty good.
2706880	2707120	Yeah.
2707120	2708240	It's still a pass.
2708240	2710240	So I thought for sure it was a one.
2710240	2711920	I was stoked as fuck, but nope.
2711920	2712320	Seven.
2712320	2717200	With that, I'm going to have both of you roll a constitution check.
2717200	2721520	You will be at a negative 20 for being yocked out of one mind.
2721520	2723280	23 on what would be a 50.
2724240	2725360	Pass 38.
2725360	2725760	Yes.
2726720	2727040	Okay.
2727280	2733360	So three screwdrivers hit the guy who's leading the team.
2733360	2734560	Two of them just hit him.
2734560	2736720	Like one hits him in the gas mask.
2736720	2738880	One hits him in the chest and they just bounce off.
2738880	2744640	But one of them slides through and hits him directly in the neck, right in between the
2744640	2746800	gas mask and his body armor.
2746800	2752480	And he falls to the ground and the other three are like, Oh shit, he's got screwdrivers.
2752480	2754320	He's got screwdrivers.
2754880	2757760	And they fire.
2757760	2760000	When I hear he's got screwdrivers, I laugh.
2760000	2762240	I'm like, that's what you call it.
2762240	2763520	I got screwdrivers.
2765120	2767200	Also, I am hiding behind this desk.
2768080	2769200	So I'm covered.
2769200	2773600	In order to use cover, you would have had to say, yeah, beforehand.
2773600	2776160	And then you would have taken another negative on that role.
2776160	2780480	So I think the only part exposed is your head.
2780480	2783520	My, my, my most vulnerable part of my body.
2783520	2784020	Yeah.
2784320	2784820	Okay.
2786400	2793920	All three of them passed their firearms checks and they are, they're lining you up.
2793920	2797840	Keith is going to take 22 points of damage.
2799360	2800640	I'm still alive, baby.
2801200	2802320	How much HP did you have?
2802320	2802960	25.
2802960	2803600	Holy shit.
2803600	2808480	So you're down to three because you took more than half of your full health points in one
2808480	2808640	hit.
2808640	2812960	You have to roll a constitution check in order to not take like major damage.
2812960	2814160	46 on a 70.
2814160	2814640	All right.
2814640	2819760	So not only are you still conscious, but you're not going to take like a lifelong ill effect
2819760	2821280	to those bullets.
2821280	2823840	I don't know how life, how long life is.
2824480	2826560	You're like bleeding out on the ground.
2826560	2830640	You're like laying down, but you're still conscious and you can still act.
2830640	2837520	Barbara immediately is just like hugging on to Philip, the man who is like bent over and
2837520	2838960	he's like slumping out of the chair.
2838960	2844800	And as she's trying to like cover him with her body, they both kind of fall out of the
2844800	2846080	chair together.
2846080	2851760	You see them both hit the ground and looking over, Barbara's eyes are wide open, but she
2851760	2853040	is unconscious.
2853840	2855840	Keith, it's your turn again.
2855840	2857360	I'm laying on the ground.
2857360	2865920	I put my finger into a bullet hole, pull my finger trigger, and I mainline some fucking
2865920	2867360	coke right into my bloodstream.
2869280	2869680	All right.
2869680	2875680	Lose 10 more luck and I'll let you just hop to and do whatever you want on your next turn.
2875680	2878240	Also, as Donovan is acting, you hear me go.
2883760	2885280	Did you see that?
2887120	2889440	Donovan is like, just like, what the fuck is that?
2889440	2891360	Like he's like still just on his knees.
2891360	2891520	Yeah.
2891520	2894240	I'm just like, I'm like, I'm, I'm not one of them.
2894240	2897280	Like I'm trying to like communicate with the people over.
2897280	2900080	Is it, are the gunshots happening as I'm talking or is it already?
2900080	2901680	The gunshots were already happening.
2901680	2906080	And then one of them, as you're like clearly giving up the gun, one of them runs up to
2906080	2912560	you holding like an oxygen mask kind of thing and is going to try to put it on your face.
2912560	2913600	Are you going to let him?
2913600	2914320	I let him.
2914320	2914640	Okay.
2914640	2920240	So as he puts it on your face, your eyes roll into the back of your head and you fall on
2920240	2922480	your back right to sleep.
2922480	2922640	Oh,
2922880	2923520	pleasant.
2923520	2924960	I need you to leave the room, Justin.
2924960	2925520	No, I'm good.
2925520	2925840	Okay.
2925840	2926560	Sounds good.
2926560	2927440	I'm not a cop.
2945440	2949840	Keith, another one runs up to you and is going to do the same thing, has a gas mask and yells
2950720	2953280	out to the others, like this one's a fighter.
2953280	2953920	Oh shit.
2953920	2957440	There's something, this one's really, what in the, and they're going to try to put this
2957440	2959200	gas mask over on top of your face.
2959200	2964160	This guy is looking me in the eyes and he sees my pupils are dilated.
2964160	2970560	Like I have no iris and they're dilated so much that I have very little white in my eyes.
2970560	2972560	I see him coming up doing this.
2972560	2975680	I take a screwdriver and shove it through his neck.
2975680	2976960	Opposed melee combat.
2976960	2978160	I do want to set this up.
2978160	2986640	I do that with my left hand as I have my hand on my gun in case I do pass this role, preparing
2986640	2987440	for my next.
2988240	2988640	Okay.
2988640	2989360	Sounds good.
2989360	2990320	So what am I rolling?
2990320	2991840	Opposed melee combat.
2995760	2997760	That's a 42 on a 50.
2999040	3000480	I rolled a 16.
3000480	3001760	Oh, okay.
3001760	3006800	So you shove this screwdriver up into the exact same spot that you hit the other guy.
3006800	3007760	Carotid artery.
3008320	3014160	Oh, and blood just splatters straight down all over your blood riddled body already.
3014160	3016160	I look like Nick cage and Mandy.
3017360	3020400	And this guy just like falls over to the side.
3020400	3025200	And I take, I take the screwdriver out because that's a fucking hundred dollar bill.
3025200	3030720	I shove it into my pocket and then I aim my gun at the next guy.
3031440	3034560	So there's one who's putting the gas mask on Donovan.
3034560	3036720	One who is coming around the other side of the room.
3037200	3039200	Not the gas mask on Donovan's guy.
3039200	3039600	Okay.
3039600	3040160	Sounds good.
3040160	3041840	So it is their turn.
3041840	3050480	And as they turn the corner rifle aimed at you, they see the second victim of your screwdrivers
3050480	3052080	and immediately fire.
3054400	3061600	Rolled a 17 and is going to get you for six damage.
3062160	3062960	That kills me.
3067280	3074800	As Keith Vigna is staring down the barrel of this guy in full tactical gear coming towards
3074800	3078640	him, you know, he's a trained shooter.
3079280	3081200	He's got his gun right at you.
3081200	3085600	You've taken out two of them, but you couldn't handle all four of them by yourself.
3085600	3088080	What is the last thought going through your head?
3088080	3091040	I get shot in the neck in that same spot.
3091040	3092080	I killed the other two.
3092800	3102160	I fall to the ground and in front of me, I see this giant pile of screwdrivers and I
3102160	3106000	smile to myself and I reach out and I touch one.
3106960	3114240	I hope I can take this with me.
3114240	3132720	Through the haze and red emergency lights, we see the two casualties of Keith's screwdrivers,
3133360	3136000	lifeless in pools of their own blood.
3136640	3143200	The camera leaves the lab, passes the elderly pile of a corpse in the hallway, moves up
3143200	3145280	the stairs and out of glass hall.
3146000	3148720	The CSU campus is humming.
3149280	3151120	Sirens are constant.
3151120	3159040	Limp bodies are being transported by teams of two in full tactical gear and dragged into
3159040	3161360	prison transport buses.
3161360	3165600	The sky is littered with unmarked black helicopters.
3165600	3172240	We see one hovering above the minion atop the bell tower, a rope ladder allowing ShamWow
3172240	3174880	Chameleon to get even higher.
3174880	3181760	As we leave the CSU campus, we see a confluence of black SUVs heading toward one of the taller
3181760	3189760	buildings of the city skyline, a building that is being climbed by something massive
3189760	3191040	and spherical.
3191600	3197280	We continue past the business district and swoop down into the back of a van heading
3197280	3198480	out toward the pier.
3199040	3207120	The broken and upgraded and dead and metal corpses of John Lee Pettymore and Keith Vigna
3207120	3215280	are jostling around the posterior of this van that pulls up to a grand old edifice alone
3215280	3221760	on the edge of the water with a well-lit sign outside that reads, The City Asylum.
3222320	3229040	Inside the front doors are two familiar guards, tall and overweight and all black with prominent
3229040	3230640	facial scarring.
3230640	3237040	After we move down through the floor, we are immediately looking through a long line of
3237040	3238400	the bottoms of feet.
3239040	3244960	Body after body has been laid out in a row covered in sheets, feet sticking out.
3244960	3248480	We stop on the final four soles.
3248480	3250480	Both right feet are blank.
3250480	3257040	Both left feet have dead skin in the shape of the circle of knowledge, but one left foot
3257040	3261920	has the name Maggie burned on top of the seven circles.
3262480	3268240	Our vision moves up through the ceiling and into a small dark room.
3268960	3277440	Donovan Westhaven wakes up to the sounds of beeps and bloops of a machine that you feel
3277440	3286640	yourself connected to and you're laying in a hospital bed in a room that is completely
3286640	3291680	dark except for the lights coming from the machine on either side of you.
3292720	3298800	You see that your blood is being drawn and there is an IV in your other arm and then
3298800	3304880	a screen turns on like a TV that's on one of those like roller things that they would
3304880	3307040	roll in when you're in elementary school.
3307120	3308480	To watch Magic School Bus on.
3308480	3310560	When your teacher was hungover.
3310560	3312080	Yeah, sleeping.
3314640	3322800	The screen is a freeze frame of like a webcam video and it's Harriet Marks who you would
3322800	3325520	recognize as a fellow student at CSU.
3325520	3332400	She was a political activist pro-union and you know made herself known all over campus
3332400	3333440	so you knew who she was.
3334000	3339680	She also became quite something in the news when she committed suicide in her dorm room
3340400	3343760	and the video starts and she is mid-chant.
3343760	3370400	And then you see at the bottom of the screen the barrel of a gun comes up and she squeezes
3370400	3377680	the trigger and then she with a splatter of blood behind her falls back and out of
3377680	3383520	frame of the camera and you're just looking at her dorm room with a paint of blood behind
3383520	3387520	her on the wall and on the ceiling and the video stops.
3388720	3394560	And a man comes out of the darkness in the back corner of the room and you can see that
3394560	3401120	he's lit by your machines and he's wearing a black suit with a black tie and a white
3401120	3401600	shirt.
3402640	3406560	I need you to tell me everything that happened.
3411280	3415600	Okay.
3424560	3435600	So
