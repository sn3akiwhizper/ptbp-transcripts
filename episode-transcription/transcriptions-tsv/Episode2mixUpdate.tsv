0	5520	Salutations, my babies. You are listening to 694.2 PTBP,
5520	11760	Contingent's best and only radio show. Now, Wolf got a little bit of news for y'all today.
11760	16240	Now, I heard through the grapevine that Officer Keith Vigna didn't get the chief a birthday
16240	21280	present. Now, that's some cold shit. She did, however, receive a box with a single rose,
21280	28080	a white hard hat, and a black silk bow tie before leaving town. And Julia Maxwell crashed her car
28160	32960	driving drunk and was pronounced dead at the city hospital. Now, ain't that some shit for you?
32960	37680	A body was found at the piston junkyard. The body has a brand on the back reading,
37680	43440	This is a fool. That's some spooky stuff, y'all. That's just some spooky stuff.
43440	49280	Now, we got a new jam for y'all today. It's Kudzu with No Backbone.
58080	82080	Alright, Joe, if you wouldn't mind giving me a quick description of your character,
82080	87600	Clark Bishop. Yeah, sure. Clark is a 17-year veteran on the force. He's in his late 30s,
87600	92320	balding and letting himself go. He's a hard worker and does his best, but it's often not enough.
92320	96160	He pretends to know what he's doing. Often he doesn't, though. He's gotten pretty good at
96160	102240	faking it. Clark is from contention, and he knows the town pretty dang well. He's a lonely guy who
102240	105120	gets home from work, heats up his TV dinner, and watches Wheel of Fortune.
106000	109760	And then he goes to bed and dreams about being a noir-style detective.
109760	114960	Perfect. Absolutely perfect. Okay, so you are going out to Carrie Page's home,
115600	118720	where she is called in last night that her dog is missing.
118720	125200	Councilwoman Carrie Pages. She is regarded highly in the community. You know of her,
125200	130160	you probably don't know her very well. She's got a night to play. She's in the old neighborhood.
130160	135600	It's where all these old houses are lined up. They've all been taken care of really well. These
135600	140160	houses have been passed down from family to family. They're like rarely bought and sold
140160	143440	in this neighborhood. What do you want to do when you arrive at her house?
143440	145760	I'm gonna just walk on up and knock on the door.
145760	151280	All right, cool. So she answers the door. She has a beehive bun, cat-eye glasses,
151280	153680	and is wearing a bejeweled pantsuit.
153680	154320	No shit.
154320	161280	It is lightly bejeweled, but any bejeweling of a pantsuit is immediately noticeable.
163200	166160	And she is kind of freaking out a little bit.
166160	168080	Hello, thank you so much for coming.
168080	168640	Miss Page.
168640	172240	So my dog is missing. Tyler, you know Tyler? Have you seen Tyler?
172240	172960	Tyler, do you have a...
173920	179920	Here's a picture. Here's a picture of him. And she hands you a picture. He's an old black lab.
179920	185600	Every morning he goes out and he typically just uses the restroom and comes right back inside
185600	190800	before I feed him his breakfast, before I leave for the day. But today he did not come inside.
190800	193040	And, you know, I saw some... There was something...
194080	197920	Last night in the backyard, I thought I saw something moving, but,
197920	202800	you know, there's this rash of homeless people. Are you doing anything about that?
202800	207200	There seems to be more homeless in the community these days. And I just think...
207200	211440	I'm very worried about Tyler. He's got a lot of meat on his bones.
211440	213920	And if the homeless people are looking for something...
213920	215840	But I'm not trying to say that homeless people...
215840	216720	Oh, no, man.
216720	219600	I'm not trying to say that homeless people eat dogs. But I am saying that
219600	223840	perhaps he is a good-looking eating dog. He's a good dog to eat.
223840	230640	I'm not... He is the kind of dog who would be... He's my... He's everything to me.
230640	232640	Ma'am, has Tyler ever gotten out before?
232640	236720	Tyler is a very good dog. He is always very patient with me.
236720	239280	And he goes out the backyard and he comes right back in,
239280	241200	because he loves his home and he loves his food.
241200	242960	Has he ever gotten out of the backyard before?
242960	245280	No. We have very tall fences.
245280	247760	Have you put up pictures yourself already?
247760	250880	No, that was this morning. Early this morning.
250960	253920	And I have not seen him since about 5 a.m.
253920	256880	It is 9 o'clock now and I'm late.
256880	259920	And I would really appreciate you to find my dog.
259920	262080	Would you mind if I took a look in your backyard?
262080	262640	Go for it.
262640	263920	I go in the backyard.
263920	265760	You go into her backyard. It's a nice backyard.
265760	269040	She's got a little back deck set up. She's got a little grill out there.
269040	272800	Lawn chairs and such. Big grassy area for the dog.
272800	275040	8-foot privacy fences all the way around.
275040	278880	Do I see anything out of the ordinary? Just on first glance of the yard?
278880	279360	No.
279360	283440	And then I want to just do a perimeter around the fence and see if there's any holes on the bottoms.
283440	284960	Go ahead and roll search for me.
286480	288960	Fail. 63 on a 20.
288960	293120	Okay. You see no holes in the fence. Nothing out of the ordinary as you're searching.
293120	295520	She comes outside and she's like, have you found him?
295520	296960	No, you're right. He's not here.
296960	297440	I know.
297440	300480	Do you ever take him for a ride or anything?
300480	305840	He goes out to the vet every once in a while when he is in need of a veterinary's assistance.
306320	307600	Do you ever take him for a walk?
307600	312000	I have taken him for many walks, but I'm in the car is when we go to the vet.
312000	313280	When you take him on walks.
313280	317440	Sir, I am a good dog owner. I take my dog for walks all the time.
317440	320880	I'm just trying to think of where that dog might have gone off to on its own.
320880	322320	He would come back. I know him.
323280	324960	But he hasn't yet, right?
324960	326960	You have not found my dog. Is that correct?
326960	327680	Correct.
327680	329760	Okay. I would like you to find my dog.
329760	330720	I'm working on it, ma'am.
330720	331220	Thank you.
331920	333520	Does that dog like to go anywhere?
334320	341760	I don't know what you mean. He comes inside and he eats his food every morning and now he's not
341760	345200	there eating his food. He should be in the room eating his food right now.
345200	347920	When you take him on a walk, what route do you take?
347920	349520	I go around the neighborhood.
349520	353920	All right. I'm going to take a quick lap around and I'll come back if I find anything.
354560	357200	Otherwise, here's the plan. We're going to put up some signs.
357200	358000	Thank you so much.
358720	360080	And we're going to find that dog.
360080	362800	I appreciate this. Would you like more pictures of him?
362800	363760	If you got them, sure.
363760	366560	She hands you five framed pictures of Tyler.
366560	368320	I take them.
368320	372480	And then she grabs one back and she's like, I'm going to hold on to this one.
374160	374480	Thank you.
374480	375520	You can hold on to any of these.
375520	376240	Thank you.
376240	380720	All right. And then I do what I said I was going to do. I'm going to do a lap around the
380720	384000	neighborhood and yell Tyler out the window as I go.
384000	384500	Awesome.
388160	389520	Kind of hating every moment of it.
389520	391280	For sure. For sure.
391280	392080	Tyler.
394800	398080	As you go around the neighborhood, you don't see anything out of the ordinary.
398080	401040	You also don't see any homeless people in the area.
401040	404480	You would notice as you're going around the neighborhood, the dogs in this neighborhood
404480	408160	do seem to be like the ones who are outside, which there are probably a handful.
408160	411680	They're all barking pretty loudly at different points.
411680	416960	Not constantly, but like in spurts, you'll hear a bunch of dog ruckus and then nothing.
418080	421200	Does Clark have knowledge of dog disappearances lately?
421760	426160	There've been no dog disappearances lately from any council members who would have called
426160	426960	the police about it.
426960	430560	Sure. Clark's plan, I don't know how much you want to do right now, but he would go back
430560	436400	to the office. He would literally do a missing dog poster as part of his service to the council
436400	439840	woman. He wouldn't do it for anybody else probably, but he's going ahead and doing it,
439840	440880	making copies of the photos.
440880	444640	Just begrudgingly making dog, missing dog posters.
444640	446160	And then going out and posting them.
446160	446960	Okay. Awesome.
446960	450720	Oh, and he would also check the vet. He would call the vet or the dog pounder,
450720	452880	wherever dogs would turn up if they are found.
452880	457680	Sure. Yeah. Yeah. There's a dog pound. Yeah. There's like an animal shelter, dog pound
457680	459920	combo thing going on in this town. I would assume.
459920	463600	Clark calls them up and inquires about an old black lab.
463600	464400	Yeah. Nothing.
464400	464880	Okay. Cool.
464880	465920	So yeah, that's what his day is.
468800	470160	They say lunch explorer?
470160	471760	Lunch explorers.
471760	474080	Yeah. That's my, that's my dream job.
474080	475680	I would absolutely explore many lunches.
475680	478000	That's like Anthony Bourdain, but for daytime TV.
480720	485440	All right, Thomas, if you could give me a quick, quick, a quip.
485440	486800	Does it quit equip?
488160	490480	How about those fat cats in Washington?
490480	492800	Let's take that.
494080	494640	All right.
496080	498640	All right. Do you want to give me a description of John Lee Pettymore?
498640	501760	Yeah. So John Lee Pettymore, he is the fourth of his name.
501760	504160	He is a, well, he's half contention native.
504160	509920	His, uh, his father was killed by the DAA on his drug farm when like just after John
509920	514160	was born and his, uh, his mother moved them back to contention where she was from.
514160	517200	So he comes from kind of a, a pretty rough and tumble background,
517200	520400	but he definitely wanted to turn his back on that a little bit.
520400	521600	He's about six feet tall.
521600	523280	He's got light brown hair.
523280	526960	Um, and just a fucking killer cop stash.
526960	528240	He's pretty average build.
528240	530480	Like he was very scrawny in high school.
530480	532320	So he's a little like touchy.
532320	535280	He like, he looks fine, but he thinks he's like still for sure.
535280	538880	He kind of had a, he kind of had a pretty wild teenage years.
538880	541440	He really, he got in trouble a lot.
541440	546560	He raced sprint cars for a while, but an injury kind of scared him out of those and,
546560	548160	uh, ended his career there.
548160	549840	Got him into a safer line of work.
549840	550320	Kind of. Yeah.
550320	553920	He was, yeah, Cthulhu hunting.
556960	561280	In every campaign I've ever played that line of work has worked out great for my character.
561280	562000	Absolutely.
562000	562320	Yeah.
562320	562640	Oh man.
562640	562960	Who was it?
562960	565520	Was it Archie who got ripped through the wall by the hell dogs?
565520	565920	Yeah.
565920	566640	That was tight.
567680	568000	All right.
568000	568400	Perfect.
568880	571200	Thomas, John Lee Pettymore is going out.
571200	576640	Do you want to go to the spot where he called it in or do you want to go talk to Jimmy?
576640	580080	I, uh, I want to go to the spot and I will probably call Jimmy on the way and ask him
580080	580560	to meet me there.
580560	582640	You said he's my, like a distant cousin or something.
582640	582880	Sure.
582880	584160	Yeah, that totally works.
584160	587280	You guys, uh, known each other for a long, long time.
587280	588320	So you call him up.
588320	590960	Uh, Hey, uh, John?
592720	593280	Yeah, Jim.
593280	593840	Yeah.
593840	594480	What's going on?
595760	596720	You called us, Jim.
597600	598320	What do you mean?
598320	600800	Well, you said there was an oil spill.
600800	605520	Uh, I mean, I don't know what oil spill you're talking about.
605520	610080	Listen, Jimmy, uh, Drew said you called in pretty early in the morning, 4 AM and there
610080	611040	was an oil spill.
611040	613200	I called the police station last night.
613200	614080	You sure did, Jimmy.
614080	616000	Oh, okay.
616560	618400	Um, were you tying one on buddy?
618400	619600	No, no, no.
619600	621440	You know, I don't mess with that stuff anymore.
621440	625040	Um, God, I, uh, I don't know.
625040	626320	I don't know what I know, Jimmy.
626320	629040	Uh, well, um, I don't know, man.
629040	630160	I don't know what to tell you.
630160	630480	All right.
630480	632160	Well, um, where are you at right now?
632160	633040	No, I'm at the shop.
633040	633920	I'm going to head down there.
633920	634240	All right.
634240	635360	I'll see you in a second.
635360	639680	Subtropolis is literally two blocks away from the police department.
639680	644480	Uh, I will, and we're both downtown, so I'll walk over there before I leave.
644480	646240	I want to ask Drew some details.
646240	647840	What, you got a call from Jimmy?
647840	650640	I got a call from Jimmy at a 4 AM.
650640	651120	Yeah.
651120	657040	I, he was describing to me this, uh, this, this black, uh, oil that was all over the
657040	659840	ground out on a country road out Southeast.
659840	660800	That's strange.
660800	662640	Did he, did he describe the location more?
662640	663040	Exactly.
663040	665040	Do you think you could get me to that place?
665040	666000	Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
666000	668320	You hold the Fort down, raise MIA, of course.
668320	669200	Oh yeah, for sure.
669200	669520	All right.
669520	670400	I'll be back soon.
670400	670800	Okay.
670800	672000	So yeah, I'm going to go.
672000	674640	I'm going to stroll down to, I guess actually I want to take him with me.
674640	676640	So I'm going to pop over there in my cruiser.
676640	676880	Okay.
676880	680240	So you go to Subtropolis, you know, Jimmy is the manager there.
680320	682240	He's like pretty much always stone.
682240	683440	Just slinging sandwiches.
683440	686720	Hey Jimmy, first of all, uh, can you have your, can you have your boy make me a number
686720	689280	five and then, uh, I need to talk to you for a minute.
689280	689760	All right.
689760	690880	Um, yeah.
690880	691760	Uh, what's up?
692400	695360	So you don't have any recollection of talking to, talking to Andrew last night.
696960	702480	Uh, um, uh, nope.
702480	704480	What'd you, what'd you do last night, buddy?
704480	709520	Oh, you know, I was just, uh, uh, at, out at the house, uh,
710560	711280	hanging out.
711280	712160	Where does he live?
712160	713040	Went for drive.
713040	716560	Uh, he lives, uh, he lives out kind of by the country.
717200	717920	That part of town.
717920	719360	Yeah, it's down there.
719360	721520	He's like kind of got some land out there.
721520	725040	Your, your family, like all of your distant relatives just kind of like have a plot of
725040	726240	land that they've had forever.
726880	729520	Um, so he's down in the Southeast part of town.
729520	731280	It's a little bit more farmy out there.
731280	732080	Gotcha.
732080	734000	So Jimmy, what do you recall from last night?
734000	735360	Go ahead and roll humid.
736640	737200	Should Pat.
737200	737520	Yeah.
737520	738480	24 on a 50.
738480	739920	He's going to level with you.
739920	748800	Man, uh, I, I got some pretty good mushrooms in recently and I hadn't, you know, tripped
748800	749360	in a while.
749360	754480	So I went ahead and just did some, I did some mushrooms last night, man.
754480	759040	And I don't know, I kind of went off into my own little space in my head.
759040	762160	And, uh, I mean, it was a crazy fucking trip.
762160	762640	Yeah.
762640	765920	I, uh, I definitely don't remember calling the police station.
765920	768160	I'm really sorry, but don't worry, man.
768160	769360	It's no big deal.
769360	770080	I feel bad.
770080	770720	Sorry, man.
771280	771760	Okay.
771760	777280	I mean, I'm still, I'm going to have to ask you to come down to the spot with me and take
777280	777840	a look at things.
777840	778480	Oh, just.
778480	778800	Okay.
778800	779360	Yeah.
779360	780560	Jimmy, I'm not arresting you.
780560	781360	Oh my God.
781360	782400	Jesus Christ.
782400	784160	I thought as long as you sell me some of those mushrooms.
784160	785760	I was like John Lee Powell.
785760	788800	You know, I actually, I, I've got an eighth with your name on it.
788800	789600	I love you guys.
789600	790400	Hey.
790400	795040	And so you guys drive out there and as you're driving, he's kind of telling you, uh, about
795040	795760	his trip.
795760	798000	And, uh, yeah, I'm eating that sandwich.
798000	800240	Yeah, chow down that number five.
800240	801280	It's good chip layer.
802160	802640	Of course.
803600	805600	And, uh, you guys make it out there.
805600	811200	It's the exact spot that he had told Drew that he was at when you saw the oil spill
811200	813760	and there's, uh, seems to be nothing out there on the ground.
814320	817360	Got any recollection of being out here last night, Jimmy?
817360	822720	Uh, he kind of stares off and he's like, no, man, pretty, pretty good stuff.
822720	824080	It was crazy, dude.
824080	825360	It was nuts, man.
825360	830560	I was having these crazy dreams and like, I could have sworn it was real, man.
830560	831200	There's just,
833760	837920	Jimmy, uh, you know, you normally don't black out from mushrooms.
837920	839360	I never have before.
839360	842880	Uh, it was, uh, it was a nuts night, man.
842880	844400	I mean, I was drinking.
844400	845200	I'll admit it.
845200	845840	Yeah.
845840	850000	I was drinking a bit too, uh, but I'm pretty sure I didn't come out here.
850000	850720	Maybe I did.
850720	852160	I don't fucking know, man.
852400	857520	And he like goes through his phone and he sees that he made a call to the police station
857520	860400	which is the first time he actually believes you that this happened.
860400	862640	And he's like, Oh wow.
864000	865120	Yeah, that's my bad.
866480	869840	Jimmy man, I love you, but I watched
872240	876240	a woman's face destroyed last night cause she was driving drunk.
877840	880640	So you're going to have to promise me, be a little more careful.
880720	884720	I promise John, we don't want nothing to happen to that face of yours.
884720	887520	Oh, and why would you?
887520	888480	It's a good face.
888480	889120	Pretty good face.
889120	890880	Hey, don't worry man.
890880	891840	It's just no big deal.
891840	892640	I'll take care of it.
892640	893280	It's fine.
893280	893680	It's fine.
893680	894800	And I'm sorry about the call.
894800	899440	I don't know what that was about, but shit, you know, who knows what I was seeing?
899440	901920	All right, well I'm going to poke around anyway.
901920	902400	All right.
902400	903120	All right.
903120	904240	So do you like get out?
904240	905760	Are you parking and getting out of the car?
905760	906000	All right.
906000	907440	So you park and get out of the car.
907440	908880	You're out on this country road.
908880	910240	There's like nobody out here.
910240	913040	Um, you see a few houses in the distance and stuff.
913040	913440	Yeah.
913440	917440	Nothing, uh, nothing too particular and checking the road, man.
917440	921040	There's not even like a stain on the ground.
924480	929600	Well, Jimmy, I mean, Hey, you know, even in that compromised mental state,
929600	931760	I'm glad you saw something and said something.
931760	932160	Yeah.
932160	932880	You called us.
932880	933840	That's the right thing to do.
934240	940800	Um, I am, I've got some vacation time looking up, coming up next month and I am looking
940800	942960	forward to these mushrooms, man.
942960	943440	Yeah.
943440	944640	Come on out to the farm.
944640	946080	You want to choose some shotguns?
946080	947360	Abso-fucking-lutely.
947360	947760	I do.
947760	948320	Yeah, dude.
948320	948560	Yeah.
948560	949920	It sounds like a good time.
949920	950480	Yeah.
950480	951280	Bring those sandwiches.
951280	951840	Thanks, John.
951840	953280	I really appreciate this, man.
953280	957920	I know, I know that you, you're trying to, you know, stay on, on your grind and, and
957920	962480	do your job and, you know, I should probably get back and, and, and take care of these
962480	965120	good people at contention, get them the sandwiches they need.
966080	968000	Something about this just bugs me.
968000	968880	I call Ray.
968880	974320	Listen, Ray, if you are south east of town, just keep an eye out around old County road.
975680	976240	Perfect.
976240	978000	Let me know if you see anything out of the ordinary.
978000	978400	For sure.
978400	980160	He will fucking something.
982080	982480	All right.
982480	983840	Yeah, that's perfect.
983840	988800	All right, Luke, if you wouldn't mind, could you describe Keith Vigna to me?
988800	989120	All right.
989120	992000	Keith Vigna is, uh, about five eight.
992080	996640	He's a 170 pounds, but he's down from 200 a little, he's been working out.
996640	999280	So he's slightly muscular, but he's still got a bit of a gut.
1000080	1003600	Because of his weight loss, his favorite pants are too big.
1003600	1005680	So he wears a belt and suspenders.
1007760	1012240	He's got the on purpose, messy hair look, but he doesn't pull it off very well.
1012240	1013920	So nobody can tell that it's on purpose.
1013920	1014240	Messy.
1014240	1015440	It just looks kind of messy.
1015440	1016160	Perfect.
1016160	1017200	Like dirty blonde.
1017760	1023040	Typically he's in uniform, but the uniform he wears tends to be worn quite a few times before
1023040	1023920	he washes it.
1023920	1028800	When he's off duty, he wears like cheap thrift store finds that tend to be like ratty button
1028800	1032240	up shirts as opposed to like cool vintage clothes.
1032240	1036960	He's got like a crooked smile with a slightly yellowed teeth, like one crooked tooth.
1036960	1040640	He's always got a bit of scruff on his face and he's got like bright green eyes, but they're
1040640	1044880	a little bit sunken in, uh, kind of like tired look about it.
1044880	1045600	Cool.
1045600	1046560	Cool, cool, cool.
1046560	1047360	All right, Luke.
1047360	1049920	So you are Keith Vigna.
1049920	1054800	See, Keith Vigna is going to check out this, uh, house that has the doors swinging open
1054800	1055280	or whatever.
1055280	1059040	And it was called in by Mildred Mitchell, who is the neighbor.
1059040	1062080	So would you like to go to the house or the neighbor's house first?
1062080	1063600	Uh, I'll go talk to Mildred.
1063600	1069280	As you pull into the old neighborhood where all the old nicer houses are in town that
1069280	1073680	have been well kept through generations and stuff, uh, you pull up and you see the house.
1073680	1075680	It's across the street from Mildred's house.
1075680	1080640	Mildred's house is like really well kept and the house across the street is just very
1080640	1082080	plain normal looking.
1082080	1083120	However, she is right.
1083120	1086720	The screen door is swinging back and forth and the front door is actually open.
1086720	1090560	There's mail piling up in the mailbox and the next to the mailbox.
1090560	1090800	Okay.
1090800	1093040	I'm going to Mildred.
1093040	1093520	Yep.
1093520	1093920	Okay.
1093920	1101280	So you knock and the door opens and you see a woman who has shock white hair and big rainbow
1101280	1107680	earrings and she is wearing a Snuggie and drinking tea out of a big mug.
1111120	1114160	Hey, Hey, how's it going there?
1114720	1115360	It's going good.
1115360	1118640	Did you called in about this house next door?
1118640	1120160	Yes, I believe so.
1120160	1121200	Who lives there?
1121200	1128320	I don't know the man, but he is, uh, he's lived there for some time and he, uh, years
1128320	1130560	or a couple of years for sure.
1131920	1134240	I don't, I don't, I don't talk to him very much.
1134240	1136320	He's, he's very, uh, closed off.
1136320	1140800	He, uh, he doesn't seem to be out and about much, but how old of a man are we talking?
1140800	1144240	He is, uh, probably in his like mid thirties, I'd say.
1144240	1144640	Okay.
1144640	1147280	So younger, younger guy, kind of a younger guy.
1147280	1149280	Um, when's the last time you saw him?
1149280	1154320	Uh, I saw him, uh, a couple of days ago, I guess, uh, a couple of days ago.
1154320	1155840	Was he at the house or where?
1155840	1156080	Yeah.
1156080	1156400	Yeah.
1156400	1158960	He always, you know, comes and goes, you know, he's a person.
1158960	1159440	Yeah.
1159440	1161520	How long has the mail and stuff been piling up?
1162480	1163280	What?
1163280	1165920	The, the mail over there, I see that the mailbox looks full.
1165920	1168240	Uh, how long has that been going on for?
1168240	1170560	A couple of days, probably since the last time I saw him.
1170560	1172800	Uh, yeah, no, he, um, I don't know.
1172800	1176480	Has anything weird, has he done, is he just reclusive or is he, do you think?
1176480	1178240	No, no, he's just a normal guy.
1178240	1182480	You know, we're, we're pretty friendly in this neighborhood, but, uh, he's, uh, it's
1182480	1184560	cold out, so I don't go out too much.
1184560	1184960	Right.
1184960	1185520	Yeah.
1185520	1186400	Look comfortable.
1186400	1187760	Yeah, yes, of course.
1187760	1190720	And you kind of look behind her and like, it smells like pot.
1190720	1191040	Okay.
1191040	1192880	It smells like bottle over in this house.
1192880	1196720	And, uh, she's just this kind of crazy looking hippie lady.
1196720	1197440	Yeah.
1197440	1197760	Okay.
1197760	1201520	Uh, well, you know, I'm going to go, uh, run over there and kind of check out the
1201520	1202000	scene.
1202000	1202880	I appreciate the call.
1202880	1207120	Um, I might be back over to, uh, ask a few questions, but I think for now you've been
1207120	1207440	helpful.
1207440	1208240	So beautiful.
1208240	1212080	Yeah, no, it's just, uh, I didn't, I didn't think too much of the door being open and
1212080	1214240	stuff, uh, but it hasn't shut in a while.
1214240	1216960	So I thought I'd make, give you guys a call.
1216960	1217280	Okay.
1217280	1218240	Well, we appreciate it.
1218240	1223440	I will say, um, the other night I was here at the house and I, my blinds are typically
1223440	1227680	open and I was, I was just enjoying the view of the neighborhood and there was like a weird
1227680	1229760	flash of light coming from the house.
1229760	1231120	Uh, I don't know what that was.
1231120	1232080	From inside that house?
1232080	1237520	Well, it seemed to be from that house, maybe, uh, definitely from the neighborhood in that
1237520	1238320	area, I guess.
1238320	1242960	But it was so bright, it shined into my house, uh, which is pretty rare.
1242960	1244160	I thought it was strange.
1244160	1248560	I looked to see if there was a, a car of some sort, but, uh, you know, it takes me a while
1248560	1250000	to get up sometimes.
1250000	1251680	So I must've missed it.
1251680	1253360	I don't know, but it was pretty strange.
1253360	1253680	Okay.
1253680	1257920	Well, uh, I might be back over to, to kind of finish up everything.
1257920	1260000	Uh, but for now I'll be next door.
1260000	1261360	So, okay.
1261360	1262160	Okay.
1262160	1262480	Bye.
1262480	1263520	Thank you officer.
1263520	1265520	And she like shuts the door behind you.
1265520	1266080	Okay.
1266080	1270240	Uh, I'm going to walk over to the house and, and actually I want to go check the mail and
1270240	1272320	see if I can find out this guy's name.
1272320	1273680	His name is John Peters.
1274240	1275280	John Peters.
1275280	1276400	John Peters.
1276400	1280960	There's a car and his driveway and the screen door is swinging back and forth in the wind.
1280960	1282640	The front door is wide open.
1282640	1282880	All right.
1282880	1288080	I'm going to go just right up to the front door and just kind of yell inside and see
1288080	1288800	if anyone's home.
1292000	1292480	Nothing.
1292480	1293280	Nothing.
1293280	1293680	All right.
1293680	1295120	Uh, we get my flashlight.
1295120	1296800	Are we, it's daytime right now.
1296800	1297600	It is daytime.
1297600	1298080	All right.
1298080	1299120	I'm gonna get my flashlight out.
1299120	1305680	Anyway, um, get my flashlight out and just kind of go look inside the house and see if
1305680	1307280	I can find anything.
1307280	1307600	Okay.
1307600	1309360	So it's a large wooden door.
1309360	1314480	It is open, but as you walk by, you notice that the doorknob is like fully embedded into
1314480	1316720	the drywall on the wall where it is.
1316720	1317200	Okay.
1317200	1322000	So it's like stuck open basically right in the living room, which is the room that you
1322000	1326240	see when you first walk in, there are a couple of picture frames broken on the ground and
1326240	1329280	there is a large trunk also sitting there.
1329280	1330480	It is wide open.
1330480	1334720	There is a broken lock and a pair of bolt cutters sitting in front of it.
1334720	1341280	There's a bunch of like empty cans of beer around and there's bottles all over the place.
1341280	1342960	This guy clearly liked to drink.
1342960	1343440	Okay.
1343440	1345680	But the house doesn't look like ransacked.
1345680	1347120	No, I mean this trunk.
1347120	1347440	Yeah.
1347440	1351760	I mean the, the, the picture frames that are broken on the ground, but it doesn't look
1351760	1353600	like anyone stole a bunch of stuff.
1353600	1354640	The TV is still there.
1354640	1358000	I'm going to look at the pictures and see if, what do those pictures look like?
1358000	1359280	Anything out of the ordinary?
1359280	1362080	It's just the owner and his family.
1362080	1366400	Basically there's some family pics, but it doesn't look like it's his nuclear family.
1366400	1366960	It's a bachelor pad.
1366960	1369040	Are we talking one story, two stories?
1369040	1369520	One story.
1369520	1370160	One story.
1370160	1373280	I'm going to just go search the rest of the rooms in the house.
1373280	1375120	Go to the kitchen and whatnot.
1375120	1378800	So as you go through the house, you're going to see, oh gosh, let's see.
1378800	1380560	Go ahead and roll search for me.
1381600	1383760	Oh, 33 crit success.
1383760	1385360	That is a critical success.
1385360	1385760	Well done.
1386400	1391120	So as you go through, you're going to see a key chain hanging by the door.
1391120	1397040	It has his house keys, a bottle opener, his car keys, a few small keys that say G10, G11,
1397040	1402560	G12, and a key fob for a rewards program at Dirty Dog Grooming.
1403520	1408400	And you would know from your time in the city that that is a pet salon franchise in the city.
1408400	1408880	Okay.
1408880	1414800	Also, as you're going around, you would see like when you get into his bedroom,
1414800	1418240	going through his stuff, maybe on his night table,
1418240	1423120	there are some stubs that seem to be like bedding stubs.
1423680	1424480	What?
1424480	1427120	So you know how like when you go to a horse race?
1427120	1427520	Yeah.
1427520	1429120	You've got the like bedding.
1429120	1429360	Yes.
1429360	1429920	Sorry.
1429920	1431200	Bedding stubs.
1431200	1432880	I was thinking like a mattress tag.
1432880	1434720	And these basically just have numbers on them.
1434720	1438480	There's nothing that really shows what he was bedding on or anything like that.
1438800	1443360	It's just a bunch of numbers and stuff, but you can tell with your search that they are
1443360	1445120	stubs from some sort of bedding.
1445120	1445600	Okay.
1445600	1449600	Also, as you're walking past it, you didn't notice anything inside of it,
1449600	1454720	but on your way back, you saw that there were words burned into the top of the trunk.
1454720	1455680	What did they say?
1455680	1459920	It says in all caps, do not open if you want to live.
1460720	1463120	I want to peek inside that trunk and see if there's anything left.
1463120	1465520	There is nothing in there.
1465520	1467520	There's like padding at the bottom.
1467520	1468080	Okay.
1468080	1469040	But it's empty.
1469040	1470160	It's like foam padding.
1470160	1471360	There are indentations.
1471360	1471920	I gotcha.
1471920	1472240	Yeah.
1472240	1477360	And there are four indentations, one large, two medium, and one small.
1477360	1478320	One more thing.
1478320	1482080	As you were like searching the house through on that critical success,
1482080	1485680	you would see that the deadbolt was smashed.
1485680	1491600	Like basically this door was kicked in and the wood in the frame of the door is like broken out.
1491600	1492000	Okay.
1492000	1492240	Okay.
1492240	1495440	So obviously somebody came here to get whatever was in that trunk.
1495440	1496640	I'm gonna call into the station.
1497760	1501920	Bring up a contention PD.
1501920	1502720	Hey Drew.
1503440	1504480	It's Keith.
1505280	1506400	I'm at this house.
1507360	1510320	Are you familiar with John Peters?
1510320	1511040	Do you know that name?
1514560	1514880	No.
1514880	1515440	Okay.
1515440	1520240	Could you do a quick search for that name and see if anything pops up on him?
1521200	1525840	I'm at his house and he hasn't been here in a couple of days and it looks like there's been a
1525840	1531520	break in and so I'm thinking that we might have a missing persons kind of thing.
1531520	1532560	Oh geez.
1532560	1533520	What is happening?
1533520	1534240	I know.
1534240	1534560	Okay.
1534560	1536560	So let me look him up real quick.
1536560	1538000	Go ahead and roll luck for me.
1538000	1538960	What's your luck?
1538960	1539440	60.
1540240	1541360	That is a seven.
1541360	1542880	Yeah baby.
1542880	1543600	Let's see.
1543600	1545920	What would you learn about John Peters?
1545920	1550080	He has had very little contact with the police.
1550080	1552800	Like he has never, he hasn't done anything wrong really.
1552800	1553360	Yeah.
1553360	1559360	He did find, uh, he was in the hospital for a while, like a long time.
1559360	1564480	He had a long stint in the hospital and that was like a couple years ago.
1564480	1565520	Does it say why?
1565520	1565920	No.
1565920	1566560	Okay.
1566560	1567680	Well thanks Drew.
1567680	1568560	Yeah, absolutely.
1568560	1572080	I want to go back to that trunk and try to get the fingerprints off of it.
1572080	1573200	Go ahead and roll forensics.
1573200	1573920	I have a zero.
1574560	1574880	Okay.
1576160	1576960	25.
1576960	1578960	Well it wasn't a crit fail, you just failed.
1578960	1579600	Yeah.
1579600	1580080	Okay.
1580080	1582560	You get some fingerprints off of it that you think are all right.
1583120	1583600	Probably.
1583600	1586800	You're like, I've never done this before, but uh, we'll give it a shot.
1588160	1588560	Okay.
1588560	1590400	You think you know how to do this?
1590400	1592720	Uh, you like get some scotch tape out and like...
1593600	1595280	I try my hardest.
1597120	1598160	Is there anything else you want to do?
1598720	1601600	If I've searched around the house and looked through everything, I don't know.
1601600	1604480	I guess I'll file a report just saying that it looks like a break-in.
1604480	1609200	I mean, I guess I can't file a missing persons because I have no other reason than the break-in
1609200	1611120	to suspect that, um...
1611120	1612880	Go ahead and roll an intelligence check for me.
1613680	1614880	48 on a 50.
1614880	1615600	Yeah.
1615600	1618480	On his key ring was a rewards program for...
1618480	1619600	The doggy daycare or whatever.
1619600	1620640	Yeah, the dirty dogs.
1620640	1621680	Dirty dogs.
1621680	1624560	And uh, there doesn't seem to be a dog in this house,
1624560	1627200	or any like thing that would tell you that he ever had it.
1627200	1630560	Okay, I'm gonna give a call there, see if he maybe works there.
1630560	1630960	Okay.
1630960	1631840	Uh, he doesn't.
1631840	1633440	Do they know his name?
1633440	1634800	Go ahead and roll human.
1635360	1635760	Shit.
1636320	1637200	98.
1637200	1638160	Uh, you have no idea.
1638160	1638480	Cool.
1638480	1642320	I'm gonna make a note of the daycare or the doggy thing.
1642320	1642640	Yeah.
1642640	1645200	There's no signs of any animals living here.
1645200	1645600	Nope.
1645600	1648240	Okay, I'm gonna go back over and talk to Mildred real quick.
1648240	1648740	Okay.
1653360	1653920	Hold on.
1656720	1660240	She opens the door like waving her hand in front of her face and she's like,
1660240	1661200	Sorry, what's up?
1661200	1662960	You gonna skunk, skunk in there?
1662960	1664240	Oh yeah, um...
1664240	1664740	Yeah.
1665760	1667600	I'm not worried, I'm here to help.
1667600	1670160	Let's see, do you, have you ever seen John with a dog?
1670160	1671600	Uh, John with a dog?
1671600	1671920	No?
1671920	1673200	I don't think he has a dog.
1673200	1673680	Okay.
1673680	1675280	These dogs have been going crazy.
1675280	1676160	I know.
1676160	1676480	Yeah.
1676480	1677680	Okay, that's all I needed to know.
1677680	1678080	Okay.
1678080	1679920	And something clicks in Keith's mind.
1683680	1684160	All right.
1684160	1684720	Okay.
1684720	1685520	Is that all?
1685520	1686720	That's, that's, that'll do it.
1686720	1689680	You can go back to, uh, tending to your skunk.
1689680	1690560	I'm knitting.
1690560	1691840	Yeah, go back to knitting.
1691840	1692560	Thank you.
1692560	1695120	Yeah, I'll come see what you did later.
1695600	1697040	Anyway, okay.
1697040	1697600	Have a good night.
1697600	1698880	Have a good night.
1698880	1699120	Yeah.
1700000	1700560	Um, okay.
1700560	1706400	I'm gonna go back to the station and, um, I also want to get in contact with Clark and
1706400	1708640	see what he found out about this dog.
1708640	1711360	You guys are gonna meet up for lunch probably right about now.
1711360	1711840	Cool.
1711840	1712480	All right, sounds good.
1713360	1714320	Y'all ready for this?
1714320	1717840	The three of you meet up for lunch at the police station.
1717840	1720080	This is a weird place to eat lunch.
1720080	1721440	Let's go to Klinker's.
1721520	1726160	Clark definitely has a bologna sandwich in a brown paper bag and he's, he's already probably
1726160	1727360	chomping on it at his desk.
1728240	1731680	I know you probably won't be hungry after the bologna sandwich, but, uh, I'm thinking
1731680	1732480	subtropolis.
1732480	1734320	Already ate a subtropolis today.
1734320	1737680	I'll just canonically, I'll just get a, I'll order a pizza.
1737680	1740800	I'm interested in this dog cause I've got a connection to make.
1740800	1744080	Well, maybe you can shed some light on it cause I didn't make much headway.
1744080	1746400	She's missing a black lab named Tyler.
1746400	1747840	She hadn't done anything to find it.
1747840	1751680	So I went ahead and put up some posters for her and did a lab around the block and called
1751680	1752640	the humane society.
1752640	1756960	But I did note that them dogs was barking all around that neighborhood.
1757520	1759920	So I went and checked out that abandoned house.
1759920	1762240	I talked to the neighbor Mildred Mitchell.
1762240	1767040	She is a quirky little hippie lady, but anyway, she let me know.
1767040	1768400	He's kind of a reclusive guy.
1768400	1770640	His name's John Peters that lives there.
1770640	1772560	Obviously it looks like somebody had broken in.
1772560	1773520	It was kicked open.
1773520	1778800	The dead bolt had torn off some of the wood from the door frame and door handle was sticking
1778800	1780080	into the dry wall.
1780080	1783040	He had left his key chain with like his key fob and stuff.
1783040	1788720	So it looks kind of a little suspicious that somebody broke in and he had a big trunk there.
1788720	1792560	And on the top of the trunk, it said, do not open if you want to live.
1792560	1797120	Looks like somebody had taken bolt cutters and chomped the lock on there.
1797120	1798080	Totally empty.
1798080	1799760	Like nothing else had been stolen.
1799760	1801040	The TV was still there and all that.
1801040	1805520	But I did notice on his key chain that he left, he had like a rewards, like loyalty
1805520	1809120	card for dirty dog, dirty dog grooming.
1809120	1813360	He, there was no, there was no signs of a dog living there.
1813360	1817360	And I asked, I went back and asked the neighbor and she said she'd never seen him with a dog,
1817360	1821920	which kind of makes me think, I don't know why he would have that loyalty key chain.
1821920	1823760	Definitely bizarre and dirty dogs.
1823760	1824560	It's in the city.
1825360	1830800	Not sure why he would have that, but I was thinking, I was thinking, uh, he's, he's gone.
1830800	1832240	He hasn't been seen in a couple of days.
1832240	1833360	This dog's gone.
1833360	1837280	I don't know what the connection there would be, but I, it could, it could be something
1837280	1838720	just to think about.
1838720	1840240	Isn't it as plain as day?
1840240	1841280	Man loves dog.
1841280	1842480	Dogs loves man.
1842480	1843760	They run away, run away together.
1844640	1845360	Damn.
1845360	1847840	That's why you're the best detective on the force.
1847840	1848960	What'd you find out?
1848960	1849840	What kind of oil?
1850640	1851440	Canola?
1851440	1856720	All, you know, my, my cousin, Jimmy, cousin, Jimmy oil, my cousin, Jimmy, who runs the
1856720	1859600	subtropolis, he, he was just up real late and pretty tired.
1859600	1860720	I think he was seeing things.
1861680	1863440	So there was no sign of a oil spill?
1863440	1864240	No sign.
1864240	1865040	Nothing like that.
1865040	1868640	He was, is he a drinker or a smoker or a tweaker?
1868640	1869680	No, Jimmy's all right.
1869680	1872960	He, uh, I think he's burning the candle at both ends.
1872960	1873520	You know what I mean?
1873520	1875600	He's, he's going a little too hard at subtropolis.
1876240	1877040	Okay.
1877040	1877600	Hmm.
1877600	1878560	Interesting.
1878560	1882640	But he did, what he, what he said, he described in depth what he saw to me.
1882640	1883920	Well, what did he see?
1883920	1885840	He said it was like, no, he didn't.
1885840	1886800	He didn't remember this at all.
1886800	1890000	Andrew had a little more details about what the car had said.
1890000	1895120	I said it was like a thick black oil just all across the road and the fields.
1895120	1895520	Yeah.
1895520	1897360	This was at 4am in the morning.
1897360	1897760	Yeah.
1897760	1900720	I went out there and there's no sign of it at all.
1900720	1901840	Nobody would have cleaned it up.
1901840	1903840	That would have been something that we would have known about.
1904480	1904800	Yeah.
1904800	1908480	And I'm certainly, it's probably not something revolved, like involved with any kind of elder
1908480	1909200	God death cult.
1910880	1911840	I wouldn't suspect.
1911840	1912320	Probably not.
1912320	1912960	Probably not.
1912960	1917920	Miss Paige did say that she had seen, she thought she had seen something in her backyard
1917920	1920640	not previous to the dog disappearance.
1920640	1922240	She thought it was a homeless person.
1923200	1925760	She said there's been a rash of homeless people in the neighborhood.
1925760	1929840	And she, for a moment floated the idea that the homeless men had eaten her dog.
1929840	1934800	Wait, which neighborhood, which neighborhood did the council woman live in?
1934800	1936080	She was in the old neighborhood.
1936080	1940160	Let's compare addresses to where she lives and where this abandoned house is.
1940160	1942160	Either the rose or the bow tie.
1942160	1944720	Are we talking the same, same street?
1944720	1946000	Same neighborhood for sure.
1946000	1952400	I would say that, uh, you were, sorry, uh, Keith Vigna, the house that you checked out
1952400	1958240	is on the same street, but south of the council woman's house on the same street.
1958240	1958720	Okay.
1958720	1959440	Interesting.
1959440	1960720	Um, we should have compared those.
1960720	1962000	How many blocks away?
1962000	1963120	Hold on just a second.
1964320	1964880	TNT.
1965680	1966480	We know drama.
1966480	1967360	We know drama.
1967360	1971920	Uh, you asked how many, you asked how many, uh, how many blocks away?
1972720	1973680	How many blocks away?
1975920	1977120	I'd say like a block.
1977120	1977600	Cool.
1977600	1982400	So I think John Peters is the dog and he ran away.
1983200	1985600	That makes the most sense to me.
1985600	1987280	Is this some kind of joke?
1988480	1990640	Yeah, it's a, it's a, I'm sorry.
1990640	1992480	We're talking about missing people, missing dogs.
1992480	1993520	I shouldn't be joking around.
1993520	1996480	You're not a, you're not a bad cop, but you are a bad cop.
1998320	2001920	I gotta, I gotta grow up into these britches.
2002720	2007600	In your investigation of the house, could you tell how long it had been vacant?
2008240	2013040	So Mildred told me that she, the last time she saw John Peters was two days ago.
2013040	2014960	And I checked, she didn't know his name.
2014960	2016880	I had to check his mail to see what his name was.
2016880	2021440	Mostly just junk stuff, but I don't think that he was in the house when it got broken
2021440	2025520	into because there didn't seem to be signs of any struggle or anything like that.
2025520	2028000	But as far as I know, nobody's seen him in at least two days.
2028000	2031200	You also found out one other piece of information from Drew.
2031200	2038960	The piece of information that I found out from Drew was that John had been in the hospital
2038960	2041360	for a long stint a couple of years ago.
2041360	2042000	With what?
2042000	2045200	He, uh, had trouble transforming back into the dog.
2051200	2055920	Uh, no, it, uh, they, uh, uh, it didn't, it didn't say,
2055920	2058720	it just said that he was there for a while, but I did, I don't know why.
2061360	2063600	My shape shifting abilities all fucked up.
2063600	2064720	Take a look at my dog.
2064720	2065680	I still have a tail.
2067760	2069040	Oh goodness.
2069040	2069200	Yeah.
2069200	2071360	So I don't know why, but, um, I found that out.
2071360	2074160	I told you about the key chain, the trunk.
2074160	2078240	Oh, uh, Mildred said that, sorry, was it a couple of days ago she saw that she saw like
2078240	2082080	a flashing light coming from that area or like inside of his house.
2082080	2086080	But she said that she, you know, didn't get up in time to like see exactly where the source
2086080	2089600	was, but I couldn't find anything that would have caused that coming from inside the house.
2089600	2090800	Was his car still there?
2090880	2092000	His car was still there.
2092000	2094880	His keys to the house and the car were still there as well.
2094880	2097760	Um, the only thing out of place was the trunk.
2097760	2103360	The key chain has his house keys, a bottle opener, his car keys, a few small keys that
2103360	2109120	say G 10, G 11, G 12, and a key fob for rewards program at dirty dog grooming.
2109120	2113200	What a series of bizarre and presumably unrelated.
2113200	2117600	It seems that he has a proclivity for alcohol because there's a lot of beer bottles and
2117600	2119680	beer cans just kind of strewn about the place.
2119680	2123280	The little keys that have the G numbers of those, uh, storage units.
2123840	2125840	That is a good detective work.
2130080	2131680	I've never done this before.
2134080	2138080	I've never done this before, but I also, here's, I hold up a piece of scotch tape.
2138080	2140320	I'm like, I try to get some fingerprints off the truck.
2140320	2144000	I don't know if this is how you do it, but do you want this?
2144000	2146800	That could go to police school.
2150480	2152160	I plead the fifth Clark.
2152160	2157440	When you look at the scotch tape, it's got a, it's got like, it's a paw print.
2157440	2161840	It's like, it's like literally like five fingerprints all smashed on top of each other.
2164080	2165120	Half of them are mine.
2167360	2168320	Did I do this?
2169760	2173520	Uh, no, I graduated from the police academy.
2173600	2176240	I won't tell you which one up in the city.
2176240	2177120	Yeah, I went to the city.
2177120	2178880	I'm, I'm a good cop.
2179840	2180560	I'm a good cop.
2181840	2189040	Keith, you would know that you didn't actually put any crime scene tape up or really close it.
2189040	2193280	You didn't even close the door of the house.
2193280	2194480	Not even when I went in.
2194480	2197120	Well, cause I didn't want it to preserve it.
2197120	2198960	You know, also I was a little scared.
2198960	2200240	It's a creepy old house.
2200240	2201280	You guys want to go back?
2201280	2202320	No, I mean, we're pretty busy.
2202320	2203360	We should probably have Ray.
2204000	2205600	I didn't even look in his car either.
2205600	2206160	Damn.
2206160	2207040	That could have been good.
2207040	2208880	Do you call the dog groomer?
2208880	2210240	I did call the dog groomer.
2211200	2212400	He did one thing.
2213520	2215200	I called the dog groomer.
2215200	2217280	John Peters does not work there.
2217280	2221440	And the person that I was on the phone with was not familiar with his name.
2221440	2223440	Probably because I rolled at 95.
2225360	2228720	Sometimes I just don't have any idea what the hell you're talking about.
2229360	2232480	It's a, you, you went to the police academy in town.
2232480	2234640	I went to police academy in the city.
2234640	2237760	There is no police academy in this town of 5,000 people.
2239040	2240400	I was in your class.
2243520	2244000	You know what?
2244720	2248480	I think maybe I should go check out what was in his car.
2248480	2251520	Cause people tend to keep things important to them.
2251520	2251600	Yeah.
2251600	2253440	Maybe we should all go check this house out.
2253440	2255920	It sounds like it might be a linchpin in this whole mystery.
2256720	2258560	We can double check your work.
2258560	2259600	You know what they say?
2259600	2261120	Three's better.
2261120	2262080	Three's company.
2265920	2270160	So you guys head out to go back to where John Peters lives?
2270160	2271120	On the, on the way there.
2271120	2274320	I want to call back into Drew because I, on the posters I put up,
2274320	2276240	I put the station's number on it.
2276240	2276720	Yeah.
2276720	2279520	Hey Drew, you get any calls about that dog?
2279520	2280640	No one has called yet.
2280640	2281360	All right.
2281360	2282320	Keep me posted.
2282320	2283600	I absolutely will.
2283600	2284320	That's all I wanted.
2285440	2286160	Perfect.
2286160	2288720	You take a nice little drive into the neighborhood,
2288720	2291600	go past Bean's pond on the way to the house.
2291600	2296320	As you pull up, Keith, I think you would probably notice right away that
2296320	2301040	John Peters' car is not in the driveway and the door is closed.
2301040	2303520	How did he move his car if I had the keys?
2303520	2305120	Are you asking the world?
2305120	2306320	I'm wondering out loud.
2306960	2309120	How did he move the car if I had the keys?
2309120	2311440	Are you asking how car thieves stole a car?
2311440	2312960	We don't know that it's a thief.
2312960	2314480	Is the mail still there?
2314480	2315360	Still there?
2315440	2317360	No, we're looking for the mail, John Peters.
2319680	2320000	Yikes.
2320000	2320800	The whole point is there.
2323760	2325520	Uh, the mail, the mail is gone.
2325520	2326960	The mailbox is empty.
2326960	2328080	Is the door still open?
2328080	2329280	No, it's closed.
2329280	2332160	I go ahead and take the lead and go and knock on the door.
2332160	2333840	Come and knock on our door.
2333840	2336720	So you pull up around the house, you got two cop cars in front,
2336720	2340640	maybe one in the driveway and you go up and knock on the door and you get no response.
2340640	2341120	I try it.
2341120	2343920	Oh, I mean the door has been kicked in previously.
2343920	2345840	It was basically set back into the frame.
2345840	2346560	I go and open it.
2346560	2348400	You open the door into this house.
2348400	2351760	You see there are, there's some glass on the ground.
2351760	2354960	There's a bunch of like bottles and cans out and about.
2354960	2356480	I holler in.
2356480	2358480	Hey, anybody in here?
2360800	2361360	You hear nothing.
2361360	2362800	Is the trunk still in there?
2362800	2363440	The what?
2363440	2364320	The trunk.
2364320	2365840	I don't know what you're talking about.
2365840	2366560	In the house?
2366560	2367760	There's no trunk in this house.
2367760	2368560	Fuck.
2368560	2371600	Uh, hey, where's that trunk you were talking about?
2371600	2372480	It was right there.
2372480	2374320	The one that said, do not open if you want to live.
2374320	2375600	Yeah, it was right there.
2375600	2376480	It's not there now.
2376480	2377840	Are you supposed, who are you supposed to be?
2377840	2382320	Yeah, the DM is fucking with us now.
2382320	2383600	I'm just telling you what you see.
2383600	2385600	Yeah, well it was sitting right there.
2385600	2388160	Yeah, but you said it like he had no previous knowledge.
2390240	2391280	Like gaslighting me.
2394080	2396640	I have no idea what you're talking about right now.
2396640	2400480	Look, uh, we actually, this is the first time any of us have been to the Peters' house.
2401280	2403520	Uh, am I John Peters?
2404560	2405760	We're in the wrong house.
2405760	2409040	You like quietly tuck a tail into your big britches.
2409680	2411040	Keith wrote down the address wrong.
2411040	2412880	Keith brought us to the wrong house.
2412880	2414000	Oh, we swatted this dude.
2415120	2418640	You can see, uh, as you're looking around now, there's some glass on the floor from
2418640	2422880	where the picture frames were, but they're now like all sitting on like a desk.
2423840	2428240	So it probably was John probably had a spare key, but fuck.
2428240	2431040	Why would he have moved the trunk and not like called?
2431040	2434240	Well, we're probably dealing with some shit that he didn't want to talk to the police.
2434240	2436560	Can I see an outline on the floor of where the trunk was?
2436560	2437600	Yeah, there seems to be.
2437600	2438560	All right, I believe you Keith.
2438560	2439040	Carpet.
2439600	2443280	There's like a little indentation where Keith claims the trunk was.
2443280	2444240	Believe me guys.
2444240	2446240	And you searched the, you searched the house before?
2446240	2447040	Yeah, I searched the house.
2447040	2449040	All I found, like I said, was those keys.
2449840	2451840	And you're a strange particular parlance.
2451840	2454320	Did you roll to search this house?
2454320	2455760	I crit succeeded.
2455760	2457440	I don't know what that means, but it sounds good.
2458000	2460560	I do a real good job searching this house.
2461760	2463200	Are you making fun of his accent?
2463200	2464000	The hell Vigna?
2464640	2466480	Sorry dude, it's kind of rubs off.
2466480	2467680	You also found something.
2467680	2468800	You found the betting stubs.
2469360	2470400	Oh shit, yeah.
2473360	2476160	Guys, I'm a good police officer.
2476720	2478880	I'm trying my, I want to do good.
2479760	2484640	Yeah, so I found these stubs that look like some sort of betting receipts.
2484640	2485680	What was he betting on?
2485680	2488160	That's, you should take a look at him.
2488160	2489840	What kind of money was he throwing down?
2489840	2491920	He was throwing down some heavy money.
2491920	2493600	There are dates on these as well.
2493600	2494800	Like hundreds or thousands.
2494800	2498160	Hundreds per night, but on multiple nights.
2498160	2502560	I wonder if this, if he was betting on horses or dogs.
2502560	2503760	He's betting on himself.
2506000	2513040	So basically these stubs are from the past, not this month, like not anytime in November.
2513040	2514720	These stubs are from the future.
2516560	2521760	What the hell is going on here, Jim?
2521760	2523280	They're, none of them are from November.
2523280	2524880	They're all from October and previous.
2524880	2527920	And there was a lot of money being bet and he never won.
2527920	2530160	And there is no indication what he was betting on.
2530160	2531360	Nope, none whatsoever.
2531360	2533680	Is there any commonality between the bets?
2533680	2535520	Is he always betting on the same thing?
2535520	2537440	He's always betting on it and oh yeah.
2537440	2542080	And you would also see there is a payout scale on there and he's always betting on these
2542880	2546640	crazy bets, like 30 to one, 50 to one bets.
2546640	2548160	None of these are like two to three.
2548160	2549440	None of these are good bets.
2549440	2550720	He's making bad bets.
2550720	2552720	And this seems, are we assuming, like, are there names?
2552720	2554400	Is this racing of some kind?
2554400	2555440	There's numbers.
2555440	2558960	It seems to be that the numbers are dictating what the bet is on.
2558960	2561360	And I was kind of asking, are those the same ever?
2561360	2561680	No.
2561680	2562000	Okay.
2562000	2563680	Oh, maybe sometimes.
2563680	2563920	Yeah.
2564480	2565520	Maybe sometimes.
2565520	2567040	Maybe sometimes.
2567040	2568400	And there's a knock at the door.
2568400	2571440	Hey, yeah.
2571440	2572800	It's clearly open.
2572800	2573600	Come on in.
2573600	2574480	You see a woman.
2574480	2576080	Does she have a face in the front door?
2576080	2576720	She is.
2576720	2579280	She has shock white hair and big rainbow earrings.
2579280	2584080	She's wearing a Snuggie and she has a big mug of tea.
2584080	2584960	Are you all back?
2584960	2586000	How's your knitting going?
2586000	2586960	What's going on?
2586960	2588640	Why, why are you so concerned?
2588640	2592960	Well, I just thought that there were some, you know, they came by, so I just didn't know.
2593600	2594320	Who came by?
2594320	2597120	Well, miss Mildred, the men who came by.
2597120	2598400	Have you ever seen these men before?
2598400	2602400	No, but I figured they were working with you all setting up the John one with them.
2602400	2603600	They look official at all.
2603600	2605280	I mean, they were just a couple men.
2605280	2608640	I didn't really think too much about it, but were they in suits?
2608640	2611520	One of them was wearing a suit and the other one had a big old jacket.
2611520	2616960	I mean, they both had big jackets on, you know, did the jacket say anything to see if
2616960	2617840	they were homeless or not.
2618720	2620640	Oh, eating dogs, eating dogs.
2620640	2623360	Oh, they didn't, they didn't seem to be eating any dogs.
2623360	2624960	Is that your is real quick.
2624960	2626080	Is that your Lippmann test?
2626080	2627840	Like, is he in a suit or not?
2628400	2629120	He's homeless.
2632560	2635040	Yeah, no, it was to fish for what they were wearing.
2635040	2635540	Yeah.
2636560	2638800	Did the jacket say anything on him or are they just.
2638800	2643760	No, they just pulled up and then they got in his car and one of them got in that car
2643760	2647600	and the other one took the other car and they both left after they came out into the house
2647600	2648240	and such.
2648240	2651120	And I just didn't know why you guys were back.
2651120	2653600	If it was there, I just want to make sure my neighbors.
2653600	2654480	Move the trunk.
2654880	2656320	Were they carrying anything?
2656320	2656960	The trunk?
2656960	2658320	Yeah, they carried a trunk.
2658320	2660160	They put it in John's car.
2660160	2660720	Yeah.
2660720	2662000	And they drove off with John's car.
2662560	2663060	Yeah.
2664160	2665520	They both drove away.
2665520	2666480	See which way they went.
2666480	2669440	They both, they both drove away in the same car or did they.
2669440	2670320	They were in separate.
2670320	2673280	One of them drove their car and the other one drove his car.
2673280	2676320	Do you know what kind of car that they showed up in?
2676320	2678160	It was just like a car.
2678160	2680160	It was like a white Toyota.
2680160	2682320	White Toyota, the four door.
2682320	2686960	I don't remember how many doors I had on it, son, but I appreciate you asking.
2689600	2692080	I'm glad you would value one old lady's opinion.
2693280	2694480	Are you mocking her now?
2696000	2697440	You know, this is a freeform medium.
2700400	2701680	Well, shit boys.
2702240	2705120	Keith, you, you got, you wrote down his license plate, right?
2705760	2708000	Yes, for sure not.
2709360	2711440	I do remember that it was a.
2711440	2712960	Why don't you roll to see if you did that?
2712960	2714160	What color was the car?
2718720	2720000	It was a red car.
2720000	2721920	Go ahead and roll intelligence for me there, Keith.
2722560	2724560	Oh, that's a 54 on a 50.
2724560	2727840	You have, it was a car.
2728640	2730560	It was maroon.
2731200	2733040	It was a maroon car.
2733040	2734800	Put an APB up for that.
2734800	2740080	This woman Mildred Mitchell is kind of like staring and looking around at you guys.
2740160	2741920	Watching the three Stooges routine.
2741920	2742800	Exactly.
2742800	2745520	And she's like, well, okay.
2745520	2750880	If, if you guys need any water or tea or anything, I'm right across the street.
2750880	2754720	Hey Mildred, do you remember what kind of car Mr. Peterson drove?
2754720	2755200	Who?
2755200	2757120	Your neighbor, John Peters.
2757120	2759360	Oh, he had that maroon car.
2759360	2761040	Do you know what it was?
2761040	2762480	You seem to be.
2762480	2765360	I used to drive a maroon 97 Oldsmobile Cheeto.
2765360	2766640	Was it one like that?
2766640	2767440	I don't know.
2767440	2769360	Is it a Cutlass Supreme?
2769360	2770640	A La Sabre perhaps?
2770640	2771840	What kind of car do you drive?
2771840	2774480	This is a conversation that I don't care anything about.
2775680	2776480	Well, you know what?
2776480	2778160	I mean, but I think the world cares.
2779200	2781680	This is what people want to hear.
2781680	2783200	Oh, I drive a white car.
2785600	2786400	That's real nice.
2786400	2787440	All right, go.
2787440	2788720	It's cold out here.
2788720	2790080	Go home, Mildred.
2790080	2792880	It's actually unseasonably warm if you recall.
2792880	2794400	It's a pretty nice day today.
2794400	2796080	It's cold out, Mildred.
2796080	2796720	Go home.
2797440	2800720	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
2827440	2834720	Drowning out on the nose.
2834720	2838720	With no mind at all.
2838720	2842720	No mind at all.
2842720	2846720	No mind at all.
2846720	2850720	Fly to fly to the stream.
