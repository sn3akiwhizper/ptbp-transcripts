0	720	Shit.
720	3440	God damn it, quit poking and prodding me.
3440	4840	I can't see shit.
4840	8200	Who put this fucking blindfold on me?
8200	11360	Hey, I'm talking to you, whoever, or whatever you are.
11360	13400	Cut that shit out now.
13400	15800	I got a damn show to run here.
15800	21560	Don't you know I'm broadcasting live from 694.2 PTBP,
21560	27080	the only radio station currently being run by an in-prison DJ
27080	28400	Wolf the Dog?
28440	31240	Now, we got a new Howlin' with Wolf, y'all.
31240	33480	And this week's comes from Nathan,
33480	36960	who claims he is either deep in the heart of Texas
36960	39800	or deep in the hell that is Texas.
39800	44560	He writes, shout out to Eric N for being the most badass
44560	48800	bone-digging buddy one could ask for in this dirty business.
48800	53280	And to my wife, Erin, who is so good at wrangling all those
53280	57080	werepuppies and kitties, I'm so glad you're diving
57120	59640	into a world of unseen horrors.
59640	63440	Love you, insert creepy cackling laugh.
63440	65200	Oh, shit.
68120	72400	To those hardworking cultural resource archaeologists
72400	75600	out in the field, keep on digging those holes
75600	79960	and hopefully those sinister abandoned cabins we find
79960	84960	on survey aren't the layer of any backwoods Eldritch cults.
85000	90000	Stay safe and sane, says here a creepy cackling laugh
90560	92560	again but better this time.
92560	94200	Oh, God damn it.
98680	102920	Well, Nathan, thanks for forcing me to cackle not once
102920	106920	but two times on a day where I don't especially feel
106920	108160	like cackling.
108160	111400	I forgive you this time but next time.
111400	115720	Oh, buddy, you better hope it's a cackle day or else.
115720	117880	If you wanna write up something for this
117880	121360	and caged wolf to how, click on the show notes
121360	125400	and tag us on the internet at pretending pod.
125400	128440	One of those links down there is to patreon.com
128440	130360	slash pretending pod.
130360	133840	For the whole month of November, we here at PTBP
133840	137720	are taking any new and upgraded monies,
137720	141240	doubling it and using that scratch to buy blankets
142080	145200	and sleeping bags for cold folks in Springfield, Missouri.
145200	147640	And y'all have been super duper kind.
147640	151480	So far, you've raised $375.
151480	156480	So wolf gonna double that and we can spend $750
156560	159160	on supplies for those who need them.
159160	162040	And congrats, I said I'd give away a couple
162040	167040	of PTBP logo t-shirts to a couple fine patrons on Patreon.
168040	172160	So yay and good job to Jasmine Johnson
172160	174280	and Chainsaw Unicorn.
174280	177400	Please reach out by any means necessary
177400	180160	so we can send you a damn shirt.
180160	183520	Woo hoo hoo, it's time for the news.
183520	186320	The news is wild, y'all.
186320	189000	There's a pregnant girl in this motel room
189000	192320	that we all thought was meant for storage.
192320	196600	Hmm, hmm, Scott Adams, hmm, indeed.
196680	199480	Now I'm gonna give you all what we all need.
199480	202160	It's Brat Pit with Ms. Mary.
202160	203080	Mary, yeah.
213360	217960	I gotta work in the morning
217960	220960	and this shit's so important
220960	224960	so I can't get high.
224960	230840	No, I can't get high.
230840	235120	I thought this stuff helped anxiety.
235120	238360	There must be something inside of me.
238360	242480	Does anybody know why?
242480	246360	I can't get high.
246360	249400	I think we both thought you wanted to open it.
249400	253320	No, I was saying like this, I don't really like it
253320	254560	but it's really not that bad.
254560	255400	It's not.
255400	258000	But also every time I drink it, I go through,
258000	260520	I don't like it, it's fine.
260560	261400	I don't like it.
261400	262240	And of course, we're talking about
262240	265120	the new Limoncello Naturally Essence
265120	267160	Sparkling Water from La Croix.
267160	269480	We'll like it if La Croix does podcast ads.
269480	272800	That is true, until then, fuck La Croix
272800	274600	and fuck every brand that doesn't.
274600	276280	Yeah, we will keep talking shit about you
276280	277840	until you pay us off.
277840	280040	It's like a vanilla lemon thing.
280040	281640	There's too much vanilla in it, though.
281640	283640	No, it's kinda gross.
283640	287040	We're here with David Winters!
287040	289840	Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
289840	292480	Wam, wam, wam, wam, wam.
292480	296480	Winter is coming, now is the winters of your discontent.
296480	297320	What's up, man?
297320	298760	Yeah, hi.
299920	301440	Have you been having fun with us?
301440	302280	Have you enjoyed this?
302280	303920	You got some hot energy coming in.
305080	307280	Yes, yes, I have.
307280	309640	These are like those one-word answers
309640	313280	when your parents call and you are in the middle
313280	314760	of something and you pick it up.
314760	316920	Is this like when you're at like a con
316920	319240	and people ask you questions, you're just like,
319240	321960	hey, I loved the show so much, how is it?
321960	322800	Yes.
322800	325240	So are you a lawyer in real life?
325240	326080	No.
329160	331000	Who's your favorite PTV people?
332360	333200	Yes.
336480	338120	It makes for good radio.
338120	339120	It does, yeah.
339120	339960	Who's your favorite?
339960	340800	Really short.
340800	341640	Glass cannon.
341640	343120	To the point.
343120	343960	No.
344960	349040	Okay, so if you had to pick only one Colin Hanks movie
349040	350920	and then replace him with every.
352200	354000	Can you name a third Colin Hanks movie?
354000	358840	I can name Orange County and I don't know any more than that.
358840	360120	That's the end of my list, too.
360120	362240	Oh, right, I said Dexter, that's not even a movie.
362240	366200	All right, let's dive into this shit, shall we?
366200	369880	We just learned a lot of information, so much information.
369880	372200	Well, you learned some of the information.
372240	375320	We got cut off so rudely by the end of an episode
375320	379000	right at the about halfway point of an info dump.
379000	380840	I'm willing to keep dumping
380840	382480	if you're willing to keep receiving the dump.
382480	383320	Oh, please dump on us.
383320	384160	Dump all over us.
384160	385000	Please dump on us.
385000	387560	We got a glass table right here, we'll pull out.
387560	388400	Well, that made it weird.
388400	391720	Steam and hot info.
391720	393960	Yeah, you made it into like scat or something,
393960	394800	that was weird.
394800	399360	Yeah, we just want knowledge shat all over our chests.
399360	400200	Right.
402240	406720	I love these big steamy dumps that David is taking.
406720	408520	You just cracked open his notebook
408520	412440	and got a dump of several different happenings
412440	414920	that he has seemed to have researched in the area.
414920	418640	Things like livestock mutilations, livestock alterations,
418640	421680	some missing time, some helicopters being sighted,
421680	423840	including some muzzle flashes,
423840	426760	lights being sighted in the hills, some crop circles,
426760	430400	some notes about J.A. being Jane Allen.
430440	433520	Pregnant three weeks equals six months.
433520	436560	Exactly, and the aldermen who never go home.
436560	441320	That was in the notebook, his wide ruled school notebook.
441320	442160	Freak.
442160	444960	You, again, should be questioning his sanity.
444960	448320	And you still see his Macintosh power book
448320	451800	in front of you plugged into the phone outlet
451800	454800	as you had learned earlier when you tried to dial them.
454800	456320	Is there anything you'd like to do?
456320	460040	Can I ask a kind of retroactive question?
460680	462440	When I was looking at Jane Allen,
462440	464960	when Tan was looking at Jane Allen,
464960	469960	did she seem older than she should be?
470120	472640	Nope, she's still a high school senior,
472640	474560	looks like a high school senior,
474560	477200	actually looks very similar to some of those photos
477200	480160	that you saw of her family in her house
480160	481000	when you were there, right?
481000	481840	When her mom was dressed to kill.
481840	483600	At least one of you,
483600	488120	yeah, at least one of you was looking through
488160	492200	all the family photos and she looks as you would expect.
492200	494600	So back to the computer.
494600	495440	Sure.
495440	500440	Jodine goes over and turns it on and we saw he had AOL.
500960	505960	He does, however, in typical 1990s computer fashion,
506120	510800	it does still ask for a password as you open it.
510800	515400	Does anyone have an often underused skill?
515400	519080	SIGINT, signals intelligence.
519080	520280	I don't.
520280	521120	Exactly.
521120	523380	I have a 50 in pilot.
526720	528320	Can I pilot this computer too?
528320	529920	Can we negotiate with you here?
529920	532880	Luke, we need to seriously have a conversation
532880	535920	about the fact that I took special training in parachute.
538020	540760	Yeah, I knew both of those
540760	542560	and I didn't want to connect them yet,
543000	545840	but I know what's going to happen.
547120	548460	You don't need SIGINT.
548460	550000	SIGINT is one option,
550000	552240	but fortunately there's a second one
552240	553720	which is computer science.
553720	555080	Oh, good.
555080	556960	I've got computer science at a 50.
556960	557960	Oh, good.
557960	562420	50, with a 50, given how much time and effort
562420	564060	you've invested in knowing computer science.
564060	566100	You know, in the early 1990s,
566100	569680	people don't use the most secure passwords.
569680	572440	Not realizing that information security is important.
573280	574120	Guess me a password.
574120	575640	Love, one, two, three.
577360	578320	Okay, that doesn't work.
578320	580660	Watch the sky's exclamation point.
580660	581500	Purple.
581500	583360	Watch the sky's exclamation point actually worked.
583360	584180	That's all it was.
584180	585800	Well, I didn't try that one, so.
585800	587400	Shit, I'm not there.
587400	588240	Cindy.
588240	589060	I'm sorry, Joe.
589060	589900	Oh, Cindy's not there?
589900	590720	Oh, oh, okay.
590720	591560	I'm sorry, Joe.
591560	592940	Sorry, it's not, so did purple work?
592940	596640	Yeah, Joe, guess like 15 more.
596640	599160	I try watch the sky's one.
599160	600000	No?
600000	601380	I try watch the sky's two.
602440	603500	Oh, no.
603500	604340	I accidentally.
604340	605160	Maybe I should just have you roll.
605160	606860	I accidentally hit caps lock.
609200	610200	I go back to the one,
610200	612880	because I thought I might have mis-hit that one.
612880	614300	I countermeasured triggers,
614300	616200	and the computer catches on fire
616200	620220	due to 10 failed password attempts.
620220	621060	No, I'm just kidding.
621060	621880	I'll give it to you.
621880	623800	I wasn't going to actually make you guess every password
623800	626600	until you got to football one, two, three
626600	628000	was the correct answer.
628000	629320	Hey, I was on the backtrack.
629320	632420	Go team, you were, you were.
633260	634100	It cracks open.
634100	636660	You find a document on the desktop,
636660	640820	and I am going to display it in front of you now.
640820	644220	If you check out your television, it's long.
644220	648260	This is a long multiple paragraph document
648260	653260	written in kind of first person stream of consciousness.
654300	655900	It looks like it's,
655900	659340	they're looking for evidence of extra sensory perception.
659340	661540	I am wondering about the possibility
661580	663660	that the brain translates information
663660	665500	in terms of the extra sensory.
665500	666340	He literally told us not to read this.
666340	667900	And that's why it achieves.
669580	672020	Can we shut up for like two minutes and just read it,
672020	673860	and then we can talk about what it says?
673860	676900	Is it just like a stream of thought?
676900	678500	Yeah, it gets just insane.
678500	682260	Omni parent consciousness, open network.
682260	683100	Yeah.
683100	684660	It starts out kind of coherent,
684660	686380	but it gets a little rambly.
686380	688700	Oh, we get into some Jesus stuff.
688700	691480	I thought so too, but that's not what it is.
692620	694940	Yeah, it's French, just sweetie.
694940	696540	Yeah, French Jesus.
697420	698620	So it's a long,
698620	700500	and the reason why I said not to read it all out loud
700500	702060	is it would make no sense.
702060	705440	And people would have to rewind several times and be like,
705440	707340	what the hell are these guys talking about?
707340	710020	But suffice to say, this is something presumably
710020	712220	that was written by Scott Adams on his computer
712220	713400	stream of consciousness,
713400	718180	talking about extra sensory perception and existence
718620	721420	and seeing things and consciousness
721420	725020	and all sorts of nonsense related to thought
725020	728060	and the sensory experience.
728060	729660	He should have stuck to Dilbert.
732220	733820	He's branching out, okay?
733820	735300	You have to try new things.
735300	740300	Yeah, the file title was S-Z-E comma T.
741260	743900	Of course it was, of course it was.
743900	745820	But now you have that, that's thing number two
745820	747540	from this steamy dump.
748500	752380	Thing number three, you see a file on the desktop.
752380	754380	It's simply titled message.
754380	756420	It's a wave file.
756420	760240	And I am going to need an alertness roll from everyone.
765820	767860	Fail, 73 on a 70.
767860	770300	I also fail, a 75 on a 50.
770300	773020	Succeed, 39 on a 50.
773020	775320	I got a 36 on a 50, nice.
775320	776160	All right.
776160	778760	So Zach and Luke, keep your headphones on.
778760	781000	The other two of you, please take your headphones off
781000	782760	and then we will swap.
782760	785320	Dude, Zach, we can literally say anything about these guys
785320	786160	in the beginning.
787880	789180	Fucking idiots.
789180	790800	I love them both a whole lot.
790800	792260	Me too.
792260	793640	You fire up the message
795000	797000	and this is the clip you get.
797000	800560	Dealing with, it's been a long time
800560	802400	and we have many things to do
802400	805240	and you are not sure what you are doing.
806280	809780	Stop, stop, stop.
809780	811080	That's all you get out of it.
811080	811920	Okay.
811920	815280	So someone's telling this guy to stop what he's doing
815280	817960	because he doesn't know what he's dealing with.
817960	818780	Is that right, Luke?
818780	819620	Did I do it?
819620	821200	I wrote down, not sure what you're dealing with.
821200	822040	Stop now.
822040	822860	Wow.
822860	824320	One in the same.
824320	826240	Pop, swap, swap, swap, swap.
826240	827760	Zach didn't teach you the bird.
828880	830280	When he wants to call us back in,
830280	831920	we do this on our screens.
831920	833280	Oh, really?
833280	835240	We did it when we were remote
835320	836140	because we couldn't.
836140	836980	People can fly away at home.
836980	839360	You could see on the screen if we needed them back.
839360	840200	Fair enough.
840200	841280	Well, I've got you two now
841280	843360	and now it's time for you to fire up
843360	847000	this metallic squawky voice.
847000	850600	Dealing with, it's been a long time
850600	852400	and we have many things to do
852400	855240	and you are not sure what you are doing.
856440	857280	Stop now.
858680	859720	Stop now.
859720	861960	Tone Brown, is that like the Brown note?
861960	863320	He did say duty.
863320	864560	He just said duty.
865440	867200	Can I do the bird thing into the camera?
867200	868040	Is that how it works?
868040	868860	Yeah, do that.
868860	869700	Let's see if it works.
869700	870640	No one's looking, that's the problem.
870640	872140	We often combat that, yep.
874960	876760	Oh, it worked, it worked.
876760	877920	Saw the bird.
877920	880160	So we, Joe and I like sat there
880160	882320	like rubbing our ears vigorously
882320	883160	for like a minute and a half.
883160	884120	Saw that, yeah.
884120	885600	So we couldn't hear anything
885600	888320	and you two chuckle fuckers are just like sharing memes
888320	890640	and laughing and faking.
890640	893980	Yeah, I wasn't paying attention to you at all.
893980	896260	Luke has some really funny pictures on his phone.
896260	897100	Yeah.
901540	902380	Okay.
902380	905300	Well, that seems ominous.
905300	907860	Yeah, what did you think about the,
907860	910160	do you think he's working on the Brown note,
910160	912660	the tone that makes people shit their pants?
912660	914340	The Brown, what?
914340	916980	I had not, what?
916980	917820	The Brown note.
917820	919300	He said a Brown tone.
919300	921660	No, I didn't hear any, what?
921660	923480	That's not what I heard at all.
924480	925300	What do you mean?
925300	926140	We all heard it.
927440	928380	Play it again.
928380	929220	Here's the deal.
929220	934160	I'm not sure what you're dealing with, but stop now.
934160	935000	Yeah.
935000	935840	That's what we heard.
935840	936920	Yeah, we heard a man's voice, right?
936920	937920	It was kind of garbled.
937920	939240	We missed some words.
939240	940060	Right.
940060	941360	But it mostly just said,
941360	943040	you don't know what you're dealing with.
943040	945600	Stop now, stop now, stop now.
945600	946440	What did you hear?
946440	947260	Over and over and over.
947260	950060	Well, we heard some garbled words too, but we,
950060	951640	well, I think you took it down pretty well, huh?
951640	953320	You didn't hear a name.
954040	955360	They said Billy Webb.
955360	957520	No, we heard, we didn't hear no name.
957520	958680	They said a name?
958680	959720	Billy Webb?
959720	962040	Yeah, they talked about duty and they talked about.
962040	962880	A Brown tone.
962880	965280	They said to talk now.
965280	967120	Who's Billy Webb?
967120	969040	Was he on the list of the,
969040	971440	in the notes we got of all the different events?
972480	974920	I just remember Beau Laramie.
974920	975760	Nope.
975760	976600	Doesn't look like it.
976600	977420	Nope.
977420	978880	Billy Webb.
978880	980840	Like a web of Billys.
980840	983220	I don't remember if computers had this kind of stuff
984060	985380	back then, but is there anything that we can click on
985380	988340	that shows us when the file was made, like created?
988340	991220	Yeah, the file is only about three days old.
991220	993100	As far as this audio file goes,
993100	996380	the ranty dream of consciousness file,
996380	998260	that's only about two days old.
998260	1000360	That seems to be a little bit more fresh.
1000360	1003380	And then obviously the notebook is handwritten.
1003380	1005660	So you'd have no idea exactly when stuff was written.
1005660	1007420	However, there are various dates
1007420	1009100	over the last month and a half.
1009100	1011800	It's tough to say which of those dates were reported to him
1011800	1014040	or maybe which of those bits of information
1014040	1015000	he collected himself.
1015000	1017240	There's nowhere a way to delineate between the two.
1017240	1018080	Sure.
1018080	1019760	What did you hear about Billy Webb?
1019760	1020600	That's it.
1021520	1022520	Just they said a name.
1022520	1025320	They said Billy Webb and then they kind of broke up.
1025320	1026440	And then there was a...
1026440	1028200	Did Billy Webb used to play center field
1028200	1029440	for the Ohio state?
1029440	1030840	University?
1030840	1032240	USO backwards?
1034240	1038840	Tan goes to the office and asks Riker for a phone book.
1038840	1039680	Nice.
1039680	1041640	And Riker will produce a phone book.
1042480	1046120	I go to W looking for Billiam Webb.
1046120	1049280	You can go to W and there are no webs in this town.
1050160	1052200	What a tangled web we don't weave.
1052200	1053040	Jeez.
1054720	1056120	Let's see what he did there.
1057360	1058440	So is this like one...
1058440	1059280	Okay.
1060360	1063040	Why did we play an audio file and we heard one thing
1063040	1064160	and you heard another?
1064160	1065440	Well, you misheard obviously.
1065440	1066920	Yeah, I think you guys are just wrong.
1066920	1069880	Well, if we don't know what Billy Webb is
1069880	1071440	and there's no Billy Webb here,
1071440	1074920	doesn't it probably lend itself to the belief
1074920	1076800	that we heard the correct thing?
1076800	1078280	I mean, we all heard the same thing.
1078280	1079440	You just misheard.
1079440	1081560	It's not like there are no Billy Webs ever.
1081560	1083920	It says Laurel just over and over.
1083920	1086440	Tan who is not a part of this conversation
1086440	1089520	cause he's in the office asks Riker,
1089520	1091240	do you know Billy Webb?
1091240	1093000	Is that, do you know?
1093000	1093840	No.
1093840	1094680	Okay, that's it.
1094680	1096160	Bye.
1096160	1097360	Bye.
1097360	1100160	On the computer, is that literally all we find?
1100160	1101720	Is there anything else that we should look
1101720	1102680	in this computer for?
1102680	1104520	That's really all that's relevant.
1104520	1106760	You can go through all the other notebooks and notes.
1106760	1110560	He has notebooks for various other towns all over the place.
1110560	1112360	He's based out of Tennessee.
1112360	1114560	So most of these towns are all related
1114560	1116320	to sightings in the area.
1116320	1120440	However, the Grover's Ville notebook is chock full of stuff.
1120440	1122120	It's just page after pages.
1122120	1123880	These are kind of the more recent pages,
1123880	1126200	but you go back and there are just progressively
1126240	1129840	more outrageous things that he has records of.
1129840	1132280	Little gray people walking through Main Street
1132280	1135240	and sighting of eight flying saucers.
1135240	1138120	And it goes back years actually of this Grover's Ville stuff.
1138120	1141440	It's only more recently when you're seeing specific things
1141440	1146440	about choppers or weird things about pregnant girls.
1147380	1151360	What is the oldest mention of like an alien occurrence
1151360	1153240	or sighting in Grover's Ville?
1153240	1155220	It's probably two or three years,
1155220	1157140	but it's similar to his other notebooks.
1157140	1159280	Most other places go back two or three years.
1159280	1160280	You can reason that's probably
1160280	1161860	when he kind of got in the UFO game.
1161860	1162700	Gotcha, okay.
1162700	1167000	He stopped writing comics and then got into the UFO game.
1167000	1167840	Good for him.
1167840	1171040	Tan goes back to the room and signals Cindy
1171040	1172180	to like come outside.
1172180	1173140	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1173140	1175820	So he doesn't know anything about Webb.
1176760	1177820	I got an idea though.
1177820	1179420	Well, that's because Webb wasn't a thing.
1179420	1180260	What's your idea?
1180260	1181100	Yeah, I got an idea.
1181100	1184020	Okay, you know, everybody in the town's weird.
1184020	1184880	Yeah, for sure.
1185400	1186240	Probably an alien.
1186240	1187060	Sure.
1187060	1187900	They're covering something up.
1187900	1188920	Yeah, yeah.
1188920	1193920	What if we parade Jane down Main Street,
1194100	1195600	make a big scene,
1195600	1198760	and then we see who comes out to deal with it.
1198760	1200040	Then we got our main suspect.
1200040	1202640	That seems horrible to do to this poor girl.
1202640	1205600	Hearing that through the open door at Joe is like,
1205600	1207760	yeah, I think everyone would come out
1207760	1209920	to stop you from doing that, alien or not.
1209920	1211080	Plus the aliens, their whole deal
1211080	1212640	is that they're acting like people.
1212640	1214320	Yeah, but it's gonna piss them off.
1214720	1216040	They're gonna be really,
1216040	1217520	they're gonna be blase about it
1217520	1219800	like they've been blase about everything.
1219800	1222520	What we need to do is go to who has the most money
1222520	1224360	in this town and take them out
1224360	1227120	because they are provoking, they are threatening,
1227120	1229520	they are going around dealing in stuff
1229520	1231720	that they don't want other people poking their heads in.
1231720	1233200	And what do we know, Joe,
1233200	1235840	about people who don't want people poking their heads in,
1235840	1237420	who threaten other people?
1237420	1239620	It's always about...
1239620	1240460	Money.
1240460	1241280	Money.
1241280	1242840	It's always about money.
1242840	1244680	Joe is like looking at you intently
1244680	1248480	and he kind of like holds up a cardigan and hands it to you.
1248480	1250960	She puts on a second cardigan and calms down.
1252360	1254040	I only got one more, fellers.
1254040	1255360	As she's calming down,
1255360	1260080	you hear out in the parking lot a car arrive.
1260080	1262080	We all turn and look.
1262080	1264320	Now, before we do that though,
1264320	1265760	I need to just talk to Joe.
1265760	1267880	Joe the character or Joe the human?
1267880	1272360	Sorry, Joe, that was such a bad choice, Thomas.
1272880	1275640	I think it's a good name.
1275640	1276480	It is a good name.
1276480	1279000	I don't fault you for that.
1279000	1280840	I think, look, do me a favor.
1280840	1284160	Next time you have a victim like myself
1284160	1286680	in this similar situation,
1286680	1289640	only use your four names scrambled between them.
1289640	1290800	There you go.
1290800	1291920	There you go.
1291920	1295440	Send us Troy Lavallee and we will do that to him.
1295440	1297480	Luke Zach.
1297480	1298320	Go, Thomas.
1298320	1300680	I want to talk to Joe the human being.
1300680	1301640	Real life, Joe.
1301680	1303760	Everyone else, wait for the bird signal.
1303760	1305280	It's just me and you, David.
1305280	1306480	It is just me and you.
1306480	1309840	And really, you know, I just wanted to take a break.
1309840	1310680	I'm good with you, yeah.
1310680	1311880	And really just, yeah,
1311880	1313600	just relax without those chuckleheads.
1313600	1315480	That's really kind of the main thing.
1315480	1316520	What you getting for dinner tonight?
1316520	1318360	Bad thing about saying that is at some point,
1318360	1319720	someone's going to be editing this
1319720	1322360	and I just called them a chucklehead, so, you know.
1323640	1328080	I hope it's you editing this episode and not anyone else.
1328080	1329600	However, I have news for you.
1329600	1332960	And I have news for your character.
1332960	1334560	I guess not you,
1334560	1338920	but that news is you feel a little bit different today.
1338920	1340720	You have no real change in appetite,
1340720	1343880	but for whatever reason, you're incredibly thirsty.
1343880	1346400	You just feel like you're always dehydrated.
1346400	1348400	You always need to be drinking something,
1348400	1350080	thinking about where you're getting your next drink.
1350080	1351440	Not necessarily an alcoholic beverage,
1351440	1354040	just water, coffee, anything,
1354040	1357240	but you can't quite quench that thirst.
1357280	1359960	Additionally, speaking of the dumps
1359960	1362120	we were discussing earlier,
1362120	1363480	you can still urinate,
1363480	1367200	but there's no more number two for you in your future.
1367200	1369080	Is it a constipation thing
1369080	1370480	or I just don't feel the need to?
1370480	1372080	You don't feel the need to.
1372080	1373200	Yes, I'm sorry.
1373200	1374280	I don't want to make it sound like
1374280	1377920	you have suddenly just become constipated and you need,
1377920	1380320	yeah, you need to go to a drug store and get,
1380320	1381560	no, it's not quite like that.
1381560	1383240	You have absolutely no urge to.
1383240	1384160	Okay, cool.
1384160	1385160	And that's pretty much it.
1385160	1386280	That's all you know.
1386280	1388920	Just the standard, last night was thirsty Thursday.
1388920	1389840	Today's Friday.
1389840	1390680	You know, it happens.
1390680	1393440	Some Fridays you just need to drink a lot of fluid
1393440	1396760	and you can never defecate ever again.
1396760	1397600	That's it.
1397600	1398440	You know.
1398440	1399360	All right, I'll do the bird thing.
1399360	1402080	It's working, it's working.
1402080	1403160	We got him.
1403160	1406200	A car has rolled up into the parking lot.
1406200	1411200	It is an early nineties Lincoln town car, in fact.
1411880	1414040	And it rolls up, sees you all
1414040	1418360	and a sharply dressed individual, a G man, if you will,
1418360	1422880	hops out of the car with a large duffle bag
1422880	1426320	and comes up towards the office, towards Riker's office,
1426320	1427720	kind of asks where you guys are.
1427720	1430920	Riker's in that office, points kind of down your way
1430920	1433480	towards the Scott Adams, Jane Allen room.
1433480	1437120	And he gets there and knocks on the ajar door.
1437120	1437940	Wait, hello?
1437940	1440880	He stands like in the middle of all of us,
1440880	1442600	quiet and then knocks on the door?
1442600	1443640	I thought you were inside.
1444200	1445040	You and I are outside.
1445040	1445880	Yeah, we're outside.
1445880	1446700	They're inside.
1446700	1447540	Cindy and Jane are outside.
1447540	1448380	Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
1448380	1449200	I thought everyone was inside.
1449200	1452360	So we're like waving at him as he comes towards us.
1452360	1454360	He just walks past you and ignores you.
1454360	1455200	No, just kidding.
1455200	1456480	He stops you.
1456480	1457520	Sorry.
1457520	1458760	Zach's head whipped to us.
1458760	1459600	He's like, that's fair.
1459600	1460440	What's that mean?
1460440	1461960	Okay, that's wild.
1461960	1463360	It's a clue.
1463360	1464960	He can't see you anymore.
1464960	1466480	You're now invisible.
1466480	1467960	We're the aliens.
1467960	1469280	Am I real?
1469280	1472060	Sorry, I didn't realize you were standing there.
1472060	1472900	Hello?
1472900	1474280	And he whips out a badge.
1474280	1475700	Agent Jordan Cook.
1475700	1477860	You are the agents, right?
1477860	1480660	Agent Cindy Wodabaga, DEA.
1480660	1483700	I'm Agent Tan Loothide, ATF.
1483700	1484780	Excellent, excellent.
1484780	1489580	Well, I have a delivery from your handler, if you will.
1489580	1490420	Thank you.
1490420	1491540	Yes.
1491540	1494900	Gives you an envelope and gives you a duffel bag.
1494900	1497000	Oh, sorry.
1497000	1498300	I almost forgot something.
1498300	1502060	He looks around back and forth,
1502060	1504900	makes sure Riker's not listening or anyone else.
1504900	1506220	Bubble gum tree.
1506220	1507780	Nice.
1507780	1508620	Bubble gum tree.
1508620	1510140	Bubble gum tree.
1510140	1511740	And then he turns around and just walks away.
1511740	1514300	How heavy is the duffel bag that I'm carrying?
1514300	1515460	Relatively heavy.
1515460	1517220	It's about 20 pounds.
1517220	1519180	And then you have one of those envelopes,
1519180	1521300	kind of an inner office mail sort of envelope.
1521300	1524860	One of those big yellow ones with like the string.
1524860	1526020	Manila envelope.
1526020	1527180	Vanilla envelope.
1527180	1528460	Vanilla envelope.
1528460	1530140	It smells like fresh vanilla.
1530140	1532740	It smells like a Yankee candle, kind of.
1532740	1535980	These new Limoncello La Croix envelopes
1535980	1538500	are not that good in my opinion.
1538500	1540340	I look at them and it's okay.
1540340	1542340	And then I look at it a little more and I'm like,
1542340	1543180	I don't like that.
1543180	1544020	I just don't know about it.
1544020	1546180	But I go ahead and open it up anyway.
1546180	1548940	I also unzip the duffel bag a little bit.
1548940	1551380	We like walk into the room as we do this.
1551380	1552220	Sure.
1552220	1555380	So in the envelope is a single piece of paper
1555380	1557380	with some stuff typed out on it.
1557380	1560540	And then in the bag is a bunch of liquid.
1560540	1563260	Six gallons of liquid with two spray bottles.
1563260	1564620	Almost the same kind of spray bottles
1564620	1566180	you would use to clean with.
1566180	1567700	What does the liquid look like?
1567700	1571060	The liquid is basically colorless.
1571060	1575420	It just looks to be slightly foamy and bubbly, transparent.
1575420	1577520	Does anyone else have a high pharmacy?
1577520	1578700	I have a 50.
1578700	1579680	I don't know why I'm looking.
1579680	1580660	I don't have any.
1580660	1582260	How about you just look at the piece of paper?
1582260	1583100	Yeah.
1583100	1583920	In the envelope.
1583920	1584760	Yeah, maybe we do that.
1585000	1586160	Let's do some rolls first.
1586160	1587980	Yeah, let's do some rolls first.
1587980	1589320	She starts smelling them.
1591480	1592600	All right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1592600	1593700	We read the paper.
1593700	1594540	Are you sure?
1594540	1595880	I mean, you can just mess around with the liquids
1595880	1596720	if you want.
1596720	1597540	We can also go that route.
1597540	1598380	Let's talk to the liquid for a while.
1598380	1599480	Slap these bags real quick.
1599480	1601520	Let's just start spraying each other with them.
1603160	1604000	You can.
1604000	1604840	Spray fight.
1604840	1605660	You can.
1607160	1610240	It's gonna be acid to break down a fucking body, dude.
1611320	1614500	No, as Tan is like reaching into the duffel bag
1615220	1617820	and about to touch one of the containers.
1617820	1620620	Yeah, no, go ahead and stop doing that, please.
1620620	1623140	If your stomach doesn't already hurt
1623140	1626020	from being aware of what we're about to do,
1626980	1629940	then I have the unfortunate pleasure to let you know that,
1630800	1632980	well, you can go ahead and read Harlan.
1632980	1634060	Your eyes look pretty big.
1634060	1636060	Go ahead and read that note there.
1636060	1638740	Okay, I read the note.
1638740	1640820	Yeah, I'll read the note to you
1640820	1642220	because there is no note for you to read.
1642220	1644420	How is it gonna talk to David?
1645300	1646140	Yeah, let me tell you what it says.
1646140	1649100	And it's a memo from Derringer, typed out on a typewriter.
1649100	1651420	He didn't even want this thing to hit the computer network
1651420	1652820	or be saved anywhere.
1652820	1657060	The tissue test came back on the muscle tissue
1657060	1658960	in Billy Ray's body.
1658960	1661860	And they're not really sure exactly what it is.
1661860	1666860	It's some sort of matter, extraterrestrial substance
1667480	1670140	that basically replaced his muscles.
1670140	1672020	And they're not sure exactly how it works,
1672020	1674620	but they've developed a detecting compound
1674620	1676800	that they've rushed together for you.
1676800	1678300	That's what's in the duffel bag.
1678300	1681820	You can spray it on things.
1681820	1685980	And when you spray it and it detects this matter,
1685980	1688180	things will turn purple.
1688180	1689380	Oh my God.
1689380	1692820	We're just gonna spray every folk in this town.
1692820	1696180	Yeah, Tan sprays his own arm.
1696180	1697620	Oh yeah, let's spray each other
1697620	1699140	and make sure we're all clean.
1699140	1700320	I spray everybody.
1702100	1703460	Okay.
1703460	1708460	Cindy, you did your nightly routine, right?
1708620	1709540	I did indeed.
1709540	1710380	Last night?
1710380	1711200	Yep.
1711200	1713300	Your entire face turns purple.
1713300	1716980	Harlan, you splashed water under your armpits
1716980	1718860	and threw on a fresh polo.
1718860	1720420	Your upper arms turn purple.
1724300	1728860	Anyone else that had a glass of water, I believe, up front,
1728860	1730080	your mouth, your lips,
1730080	1731940	the inside of your mouth turns purple.
1732660	1733900	Oh shit.
1733900	1735340	It's all over your hands
1735340	1737840	if you wash your hands after going to the bathroom.
1737840	1741060	Joe, I know that you stopped washing your hands
1741060	1743260	on purple hands years ago.
1745100	1746820	No, I said he used the bathroom.
1746820	1748160	I said he has a drink.
1748160	1750040	I don't know if surely he drank some water,
1750040	1752260	but we could also just have him back away in terror
1752260	1753100	from all of you.
1754200	1755760	It looks like they miscalculated.
1755760	1757320	It's just picking up sweat.
1757320	1759620	These are sweat glands, obviously.
1759620	1761940	Yeah, my face is really sweaty and purple.
1761940	1764380	Alien sweat glands, you son of a bitch.
1765260	1767900	I need two sanity rolls right now.
1767900	1772820	The first sanity roll is the fact that this stuff exists.
1774660	1776720	I had a fail and a crit fail.
1778240	1779660	The first one's a fail.
1779660	1782940	Okay, yeah, let's do the first one first.
1782940	1785760	On a fail on the first one, you're gonna take one.
1786940	1788840	I failed as well. Otherwise it's zero.
1788840	1791880	That's the unnatural though, so no check boxes for that.
1791880	1794320	The second though, realizing it's in your body
1794320	1796720	and the fact that to some extent,
1796720	1799120	you have ingested something in this town,
1799120	1800880	washed your hands in this town,
1800880	1802520	it's basically in the water supply.
1802520	1804680	You know that much so far.
1807020	1812020	Okay, that's gonna be one on a success, four on a failure.
1814560	1816380	And what about a crit fail?
1816380	1818480	I believe that is gonna be eight, no?
1819360	1820680	You can do whatever you want, dude.
1820680	1821800	I like that.
1823920	1826360	Think about, Tan, how you were sick
1826360	1830000	at the slightest sight of anything so far, right?
1830000	1832640	First, what was the, I forget the first time you puked.
1832640	1833600	Was it in?
1833600	1835480	It was at the office, the first video.
1835480	1836560	Was it the office, right?
1836560	1837400	Yeah.
1837400	1838720	Yeah, it was at the office the first video
1838720	1840600	and it got progressively worse
1840600	1843720	when you caught the smell of that dead body.
1843720	1845920	And now on your very first mission,
1845960	1850960	you recognize that it's not going particularly great for you.
1851720	1854800	So with taking eight sanity damage.
1854800	1856760	Right, I will say obvious.
1856760	1858200	Did you take one first?
1858200	1859040	Or did you pass that one?
1859040	1859880	I did, I took one.
1859880	1860700	So you took nine total?
1860700	1861540	I took nine total.
1861540	1862440	Jeez Louise.
1862440	1867440	I am at 37 and my breaking point is 43.
1867520	1868360	Yeah.
1868360	1869480	So I'm quite a bit past that.
1869480	1871560	Okay, so technically- And I'm feeling good.
1871560	1873740	Yeah, feeling good, nothing happens.
1874740	1876900	Technically losing that five in a clip,
1876900	1879180	you're gonna go temporarily insane.
1879180	1880780	You can potentially suppress that
1880780	1883660	by projecting that onto one of your bonds
1883660	1885780	if you so choose or not.
1885780	1887340	You can just go temporarily insane.
1887340	1888180	It's totally up to you.
1888180	1890940	Tan really likes his bonds, so he just takes it himself.
1890940	1893180	Okay, all right, I'm gonna roll a die.
1894500	1897820	Your temporary insanity is going to manifest
1897820	1900340	in you fleeing.
1900520	1904220	Realizing this, you're just going to run away
1904220	1907180	from the hotel without saying much
1907180	1908160	while everyone else is there
1908160	1910260	also feeling pretty bad about things.
1910260	1911920	You just start to run away.
1911920	1914980	You will kind of come to after booking it,
1914980	1917060	losing your breath and kind of turn around
1917060	1918300	and be able to walk back.
1918300	1923300	Tan, he chokes down some vomit and then just runs away
1924500	1927260	and he runs right towards the mega deuce.
1927260	1929700	You run towards the mega deuce, okay?
1929740	1932340	Harlan hit a breaking point in that sanity loss also.
1932340	1934380	So did Joe Dean.
1934380	1937060	Well, I guess we all need to reset our breaking points.
1937060	1938340	I didn't hit a breaking point,
1938340	1940740	but I did lose five sanity.
1940740	1941740	Okay. Oh, shit.
1943060	1946400	Cindy is gonna submit, curl up,
1946400	1947820	just disconnect from everyone,
1947820	1949300	maybe go back into her room.
1949300	1950140	Oh, yeah.
1950140	1952140	Flashback to some of the crazy shit
1952140	1953780	she's seen in the field.
1953780	1956740	She goes to start a bath for herself
1956740	1958760	and as she goes to touch the knob
1958760	1960120	to turn the hot water on,
1960120	1963360	she like freaks out, hits the wall behind her.
1963360	1965400	And as she hits the wall behind her
1965400	1967800	in this small motel bathroom,
1967800	1971440	she sent into a flashback of her throwing her husband
1971440	1975560	up against the wall of a small motel bathroom.
1975560	1977160	And then she shakes her head
1977160	1978800	and goes and lays down in the bed.
1978800	1983800	Everyone else is going to have some anxiety going forward
1985020	1988200	when it comes to mealtime.
1988680	1992560	The thought of putting anything in your body at this point
1992560	1996840	is going to be somewhat anxiety provoking,
1996840	1998320	at least in the immediate term
1998320	2001280	before you seek any professional help.
2001280	2003520	As Tan runs towards the Megaduce,
2003520	2006960	that hits him and he gets scared again
2006960	2009120	and runs away from the Megaduce
2009120	2010520	because there's food there.
2011720	2014480	You've realized there's some substance out there
2014480	2017760	that got injected into Billy Ray,
2018240	2020400	presumably it's elsewhere in this town.
2020400	2023800	Clearly it's in the water supply
2023800	2025640	because it's on your hands, your face,
2025640	2027960	your mouth, your armpits.
2027960	2030640	Harlan's going to make eyes with Jodine.
2030640	2032640	It's in the water supply.
2032640	2035240	That makes sense now.
2035240	2037080	That's what we saw.
2037080	2039680	Right, shooting out of the tub.
2039680	2043040	I kind of fill in Tan and Cindy.
2043040	2046080	Real quick, I think that makes this the EPA's problem.
2047760	2051000	Also, Tan is just like wandering
2051000	2052960	around the parking lot right now.
2052960	2054800	Oh right, I forgot you were gone.
2054800	2058020	But it looked like mercury.
2059120	2061720	But it seemed conscious.
2061720	2065000	It seemed like it was moving of its own accord, right?
2065000	2069000	It seemed like some kind of unstoppable force to me.
2069000	2070340	I don't know.
2070340	2071560	I don't know if what I'd saw,
2071560	2074560	I'd call consciousness as we know it.
2075400	2078240	It dodged your glass.
2078240	2081160	It flattened itself out to break it, right?
2081160	2083400	Yeah, I guess that is pretty thoughty.
2083400	2085600	Or reactive at the very least.
2085600	2088200	Yeah, yeah.
2088200	2090340	Hey, I don't want to eat anything from the diner.
2090340	2093560	Should we get just a bunch of like little Debbie's and stuff
2093560	2095640	that comes in plastic from the gas station?
2095640	2097840	I want to hit the vending machine.
2097840	2099200	I'm parched.
2099200	2102200	The idea of not being able to drink the water here,
2102200	2103040	that scares me.
2103980	2104820	I need to top up.
2104820	2105720	Well, let's get you a Coke.
2105720	2108220	Everybody knows in 1992 that it's fat that makes you fat,
2108220	2109060	not sugar.
2115420	2119520	You can get some Olestra chips out of the vending machine.
2119520	2120360	You can do that though.
2120360	2123920	There is a vending machine right near the manager's office.
2123920	2127580	Soda, little Debbie's, little Dorito bags.
2127580	2131280	Harlan buys a Coke and he cracks the top on it
2131280	2136280	and he downs the Coke without it getting away from his lips.
2136360	2139900	And he tosses it in the trash can and buys two more.
2139900	2141800	A little thirsty there?
2141800	2144560	Yeah, I'm thirsty.
2146520	2148160	I don't want to drink the water here.
2148160	2149440	We can't drink the water here.
2149440	2151880	We can't drink the water here.
2151880	2154680	Yeah, I mean, that's a reasonable conclusion.
2154680	2157700	Would some of this mealtime anxiety be alleviated
2157700	2160000	when we do have like these prepackaged foods?
2160000	2161320	Yes, yes.
2161320	2164320	You feel safe enough that eating this,
2164320	2168140	it's more any food that someone else prepared for you.
2168140	2170120	Would be very suspicious to us.
2170120	2172560	Yeah, that is not a multinational corporation
2172560	2176440	trying to jack you full of low quality calories
2176440	2178300	through advertisement and other things.
2178300	2181360	Basically, you hate small business food providers.
2181360	2182520	That's kind of what I'm getting at.
2182520	2184760	No food trucks, no diners, you know.
2184760	2186800	All right, yeah, I love little things.
2186800	2188080	That tracks, dude.
2188080	2192000	So yeah, Joe Dean gets a couple sprites for himself.
2192000	2196160	He's like, yeah, maybe I will be thirsty, like Harland.
2196160	2198600	And then I guess they go back with the others.
2198600	2200840	Tan is in the parking lot.
2200840	2203280	He ran towards the Mega Deuce
2203280	2206440	and then ran away from the Mega Deuce.
2206440	2209520	And he's still got like one of the spray bottles in his hand
2209520	2212520	and he's just like spraying cars in the parking lot.
2212520	2215160	Well, hold Tan, Tan, Tan, Tan.
2215160	2216960	We don't want to go wasting that.
2216960	2219240	He stops spraying cars in the parking lot.
2220360	2223500	As you spray cars, there's not,
2223500	2225480	nothing's really turning purple.
2225480	2228460	Cindy Woodabaga walks out of her room,
2228460	2231560	moves her hands toward her cardigan
2231560	2233940	to kind of put her hands on her hips,
2233940	2237600	which reveals the baton and pepper spray she has
2237600	2240220	on either side on her belt.
2240220	2244260	And then she says, Merle.
2245220	2248200	So Cindy, we do need to talk to him,
2248200	2251060	but you know, you were talking earlier
2251060	2253020	about just taking him out.
2253020	2255560	I don't think we're quite at that place yet, are we?
2255560	2256580	We'll find out.
2256580	2259380	So Joe Dean has brought back some snacks
2259380	2263180	and he hands a candy bar to Cindy.
2263180	2265300	Here, have a Snickers.
2265300	2267220	You're not you when you're hungry.
2267220	2270300	Hey, that's a good, they should use that.
2270300	2271140	That's good.
2271140	2272340	No, that's nothing.
2272340	2273260	That won't ever be nothing.
2273260	2274780	She takes a couple of bites
2274780	2277040	and the camera whips back up to her face,
2277040	2280540	which has little granny glasses on it all of a sudden.
2284780	2288660	Took her down a couple notches, I think.
2288660	2290820	We just left Jane in that room, right?
2290820	2291660	You did.
2291660	2292780	Let's give her some food.
2292780	2296340	And this dude, the Delta Green, the FBI guy,
2296340	2299420	he took off once he gave us the duffel bag and the...
2299420	2300380	Yep.
2300380	2301580	He just bounced.
2301580	2305620	Woodabaga will go give some little debbies to young Jane.
2305620	2307900	Young Jane takes the little debbies
2307900	2309760	and just starts pounding them.
2309760	2314700	Much in the same way that Agent Nash just pounded that soda,
2314700	2317640	she does the same thing with the little debbies,
2317640	2320740	the Doritos, the Funyuns.
2320740	2322580	Whatever you put in front of her,
2322580	2324740	she just houses all of it.
2324740	2326860	She housed those Funyuns.
2326860	2327860	Housed them.
2327860	2329980	I've never heard that, but I like it.
2329980	2330820	Housing?
2331180	2332420	There's someone even in charge of it
2332420	2333260	at a government level.
2333260	2334500	You live in a house, Luke.
2334500	2335340	What do you...
2337740	2338740	You don't know that.
2341020	2343220	I was all for going to Merle,
2343220	2345060	but now that I've had the Snickers,
2345060	2347060	I'm up for whatever you guys are up for.
2347060	2348140	Well, we should just go to Merle,
2348140	2349820	but maybe not with murderous intent.
2349820	2351780	Man, it was just a baton and pepper spray.
2351780	2353020	During Cindy's rant,
2353020	2355080	you mentioned that Merle had been harassing people.
2355080	2356340	Did we get that from somebody?
2356340	2360220	That is the giant leap that Cindy Woodabaga has drawn
2361100	2364300	from someone was harassing Scott Adams,
2364300	2367400	and she just assumes that it's the person
2367400	2371380	who has the most money at risk and at stake.
2371380	2373860	So what did we hear on that recording?
2373860	2375060	It didn't matter.
2376260	2378180	Billy Webb and something garbled,
2378180	2380900	and then What Your Duty and something garbled,
2380900	2381980	and they said, talk now.
2381980	2384180	It sounded like a command, talk now.
2384180	2387420	They also said, I'm sorry, I'm talking like Clark.
2387460	2390760	I've been John for at least an episode and a half.
2390760	2394480	And that ending, it said Tone Brown.
2394480	2395740	It wasn't actually Brown Tone.
2395740	2397220	Do your voice though, I like your voice.
2397220	2398740	It was Tone Brown.
2400340	2401740	Tone Brown and Duty.
2401740	2403340	Do you see how that means nothing?
2403340	2404380	Well, what did you hear?
2404380	2406460	We literally heard someone saying,
2406460	2409780	not sure what you're dealing with, but stop now.
2409780	2410620	Stop now.
2410620	2411440	Yeah.
2411440	2412280	Stop now.
2412280	2413120	Not sure what you're dealing.
2413120	2413940	Stop now, stop now.
2413940	2415840	You're not sure what you're dealing with, stop now.
2415840	2417600	That makes a lot more sense, doesn't it?
2417600	2418660	So it does.
2418660	2420120	Putting our notes together,
2420120	2421940	one of the things I got was talk now.
2421940	2423760	So you're hearing stop now.
2423760	2426160	Yes, we probably just heard it right.
2426160	2427080	Don't you think?
2427080	2429320	Yeah, I mean, it's almost like we failed a role
2429320	2430140	and you passed it.
2430140	2432120	And I don't wanna, obviously role-playing wise,
2432120	2432960	it'd be great if we just-
2432960	2433800	No, I know it's hard for-
2433800	2435240	I can't believe in that.
2435240	2437160	But I was wondering if we could put anything together
2437160	2438960	from it and really glean the truth.
2438960	2439800	Yeah, sure.
2439800	2440620	If you wanna try-
2440620	2441460	But we do gotta keep this moving.
2441460	2443680	Adult men can never admit that they're wrong.
2446840	2447680	Yeah, yeah.
2447680	2449120	Thank you, Cindy, you're right.
2449120	2450060	We heard it right.
2452360	2453920	I believe that's a mundane day.
2458840	2461340	So at least two of you heard it right.
2463260	2464680	Let's recap where you are now.
2464680	2467240	You've already gone and questioned
2467240	2468760	the mother of the missing girl,
2468760	2471900	who you have found and just happens to be very pregnant.
2471900	2473100	You've talked to the sheriff.
2473100	2474840	You've talked to one of the aldermen.
2474840	2478480	You've talked to the guy who runs the only bar
2478480	2480480	with a liquor license in town.
2480480	2483280	You've talked to a bunch of random kids at the reservoir.
2483280	2487400	You've talked to the manager of this hotel.
2487400	2489000	We've gotten a lot done.
2489000	2489840	You got a lot done.
2489840	2492560	You've talked to, this is only a 1200 person town
2492560	2495960	and you're starting to near the double digit percentage
2495960	2497360	of people interrogated.
2498360	2499800	We're good cops.
2499800	2500640	Yeah, we are.
2500640	2503000	Yeah, you should just line the rest up
2503000	2504680	and we just go down the line.
2505520	2508400	And we'll parade Jane Allen in front of them.
2508400	2509380	Shame.
2511000	2511960	Where do you wanna go?
2511960	2513020	It's an investigation.
2513020	2513860	Merle.
2513860	2516600	Yeah, I think that's our last big.
2516600	2518020	He's the papa.
2518020	2518860	You wanna go to Merle?
2518860	2521680	Billy is not that child's father.
2521680	2523120	Oh, you think Merle is?
2523120	2524640	No, I think it's aliens.
2524640	2526840	Yeah, I think it's aliens too.
2526840	2528880	That does bring up an interesting question.
2528880	2531940	What do we do with Jane?
2531940	2533600	We have to kill her.
2533600	2535680	That's literally not what I was thinking.
2535680	2537040	Well, that's why you guys are friendlies
2537040	2538080	and we're the agents.
2538080	2540560	Okay, I was thinking maybe.
2540560	2542920	She kinda puts her hands on Tanner's shoulder
2542920	2546480	and is like, we have to kill her.
2547760	2551000	No, we don't have to do that.
2551000	2551840	Okay.
2551840	2552680	What?
2552680	2553500	Then what is your solution?
2553500	2555960	I was thinking maybe we bring her back
2555960	2558100	to her parents' house.
2558100	2560800	And then how would you explain the pregnancy?
2560800	2563040	We let them explain it to us.
2563320	2565360	This is a real 12 Angry Men situation
2565360	2567840	and we got Harlan quick.
2567840	2571080	I'm still leaning towards parading her down Main Street
2571080	2573160	and seeing who gets pissed off about it.
2573160	2575480	Your two options are taking her back to her loving parents
2575480	2577540	or publicly humiliating her,
2577540	2579560	but never killing her and the aliens
2579560	2580660	spawn inside of her.
2580660	2581840	I don't wanna kill her,
2581840	2584480	but she's got an alien baby in her,
2584480	2586360	which basically makes her an alien.
2586360	2588340	So I don't know if she can feel human emotions.
2588340	2590660	So who cares if we parade her downtown?
2590660	2592480	I just think the optics are bad.
2592720	2593560	I don't think we can-
2593560	2595400	Yeah, use that same mindset.
2595400	2597480	But what we can say is that we're gonna do it
2597480	2598960	and then let everybody line up.
2598960	2600440	Here's the deal, the optics don't matter
2600440	2602480	because we're not supposed to even be here.
2602480	2603720	So nobody's gonna hear.
2603720	2605720	What, no, just because, no.
2605720	2608160	Agent Dean, would you like to pull rank?
2608160	2611960	All I'm saying is I suggested that you told me not to.
2611960	2614240	I have accepted that we're not gonna do that.
2614240	2617960	So what, I mean, what, we leave her in the hotel.
2617960	2620720	I say drop her with me and see.
2620720	2621560	That's what we're saying.
2621560	2623240	I say drop her with Nancy.
2624320	2628480	What if we use our car phone to call our handler
2628480	2629840	and see what he advises?
2629840	2632240	He said not to call him.
2632240	2633080	Oh, I thought he said,
2633080	2635040	do call me if you have any trouble.
2635040	2635880	Cause it wouldn't be handy-
2635880	2638200	He said they would only use a courier.
2638200	2639200	We should have talked to him.
2639200	2642240	We should have sent a message to him.
2642240	2643080	Wait!
2644080	2645280	He's like, so gone.
2646800	2649220	We hop in the Bronco and tear off after him.
2651600	2652440	No.
2655960	2659400	She was fine in there for the last day, right?
2659400	2661020	What if we threw in some snack foods
2661020	2661960	and figured this out later?
2661960	2665280	She is going to punch someone's head off.
2665280	2666400	No, I don't think she is.
2666400	2668480	She doesn't seem to have the muscle stuff going on.
2668480	2670280	She's just got the alien baby.
2670280	2675000	That thing is going to put itself in someone's head
2675000	2678640	if what you told me was true happened in that bathroom.
2678680	2681680	And then that thing is going to kill someone.
2681680	2683240	You know, I'm not going to disagree with you there.
2683240	2684440	That does seem, yeah.
2684440	2688520	We have to stamp it out at the root.
2688520	2689880	Oh, I don't like Delta Green.
2689880	2692160	I refuse to be a part of this.
2692160	2694480	I refuse to be part of this.
2694480	2696480	I'll talk to Merle all day long,
2696480	2698040	but I'm not killing,
2698040	2700420	even if it's an alien, I'm not killing the baby.
2700420	2701880	You don't have to.
2701880	2702860	That's what I'm saying.
2702860	2703700	I'm not going to.
2703700	2704920	Go home.
2704920	2706040	I'm going to go talk to Merle.
2706040	2709920	You, Tanner leaves the room
2709920	2713960	and just like sits down on the sidewalk outside the motel
2713960	2715420	and it's like fucked up.
2715420	2718280	Jodine follows him out and sits down next to him.
2718280	2721200	And he lights a cigarette and offers it to Tanner.
2721200	2725660	Tanner accepts and also pulls out his own pack of cigarettes
2725660	2726840	and lights one up.
2726840	2728000	What's your brand?
2728000	2729660	He smokes Palmalls.
2729660	2731120	Yeah, me too.
2731120	2735040	Yeah, Palmall extra, extra red long
2735040	2736720	for seven teams.
2736720	2737800	Oh my God.
2737800	2741680	So Jodine takes a real deep sigh
2741680	2743720	and then a deep drag on the cigarette.
2743720	2744560	And he says,
2745460	2748360	I've had this moment too.
2749360	2751480	Well, in what sense?
2751480	2752800	Something real similar happened
2752800	2755120	on my first time as a friendly.
2755120	2756740	I'm not having a good time.
2756740	2758160	It's not a good time.
2758160	2759200	Nobody said it would be.
2759200	2760680	Do you want to kill that girl?
2760680	2761840	Do you want to kill that baby?
2761840	2764200	I don't want to kill that baby, but we have to.
2765400	2770100	Tanner, what's inside that girl's belly
2770100	2772440	is a danger to the entire world.
2772440	2775320	Our participation in this organization
2775320	2777760	is kind of precipitated on that understanding.
2777760	2779520	Tanner is literally just like frowning
2779520	2781360	and like dry crying.
2781360	2784960	And not only does she have to die at Tanner,
2784960	2789960	but if you don't get along with that picture,
2790120	2791720	Cindy's gonna kill you too.
2791720	2792560	What?
2793480	2795220	Cindy's gonna kill me?
2796400	2798100	She's nice though.
2798100	2800100	We have tattoos together.
2800100	2801600	Cindy's not nice.
2801600	2803160	I'm not gonna do it.
2803160	2805880	I won't stop you from doing it, but I'm not gonna do it.
2805880	2807580	That's all we're saying.
2807580	2808420	Oh, actually, yeah.
2808420	2809720	You know, you are the youngest rookie.
2809720	2813140	So you do have, sorry, I forgot the Delta green haze.
2815240	2817680	You actually do have to kill this alien baby.
2817680	2819840	There are rules in place, yeah.
2819840	2821800	So when you guys look up from this conversation,
2821800	2824880	you see, hopefully, as long as it's cool with you, David,
2824880	2829700	Cindy walking this girl, Jane Allen, huddled over.
2829700	2833060	She's got a couple cardigans on this girl,
2833060	2836020	maybe even the comforter off the motel bed
2836020	2837280	wrapped around her.
2837280	2841400	And she's gonna walk her out to the Bronco.
2841400	2844240	Wait, what about,
2844240	2846720	and it goes against my Christian faith to say this,
2846720	2850320	but what about an alien abortion?
2850320	2855320	I think that it would look really cool
2856080	2859040	in one of those hardcore metal fonts
2859040	2862120	where you can't really read what it says.
2862120	2863280	Yeah, it would be.
2863280	2864760	We were talking junkie graveyard.
2864760	2866920	It's junkie graveyard, alien abortion.
2866920	2868880	These are good things.
2868880	2870360	Good name.
2870360	2875240	No, but surely there's a crooked doctor around here,
2875240	2879480	a midwife who, I mean, look, these, I had a baby.
2879480	2881680	Does that mean you know how to?
2881680	2884240	We're in some dangerous territory right here.
2884240	2886560	This doesn't feel like it was already iffy
2886560	2888920	when we were killing somebody.
2888920	2890920	Okay, hold on, hold on.
2890920	2895520	I know, but you're really like, let's just kill her
2896480	2898440	instead of trying to save her life at all.
2898440	2900600	I think that's kind of a Delta Green thing,
2900600	2901760	isn't it, to cover up?
2901760	2902840	We gotta cover it, dude.
2902840	2905680	Okay, but then you can't call the episode alien abortion.
2906680	2910960	Tan is having like a serious-
2910960	2912360	I can.
2912360	2915120	I can call the episode whatever I want, Thomas.
2917440	2920360	Tan is having like a serious like mental breakdown.
2920360	2923880	When he sees Cindy Woodabaga walking Jane out,
2923880	2928880	he's like crying and he pulls the 44 off his hip
2929320	2933480	and like looks at Joe and like aims it at Jane
2933480	2937280	and is like looking for some sort of approval.
2937280	2939880	Yeah, Joe lowers your hand.
2939880	2942680	I don't trust you not to wing Woodabaga
2942680	2944820	and then she would kill you.
2944820	2947880	Yeah, Tan breaks down once again and just starts crying.
2947880	2950880	You just seem a little shaky in your gun hand right now.
2950880	2952400	Cindy will get behind the wheel of the car.
2952400	2956640	This whole time, Harlan has been kinda solemn into himself,
2956640	2960300	but he is definitely walking toward the Bronco
2960300	2961440	with no objection.
2961440	2964640	Kid, why don't you and I go talk to Merle?
2964640	2967760	We'll take the DEA, the DEA cruiser.
2970360	2971400	Yeah.
2971400	2974200	We go out to the middle of a field,
2974200	2977300	outside of town where there's no one in sight.
2978620	2980760	And her water breaks and you have to-
2980760	2984480	You have to deliver the squid, baby.
2984480	2986720	It's minute black, it's minute black.
2988160	2989580	I'm not gonna make you roll on that.
2989580	2991260	Can we just do the thing and they do a movie
2992100	2994020	sometimes where it's now a shot at the top of trees
2994020	2996940	and there's the birds fly off, a bunch of birds fly.
2998460	2999860	Sure, yes.
2999860	3002240	Just the crack in the distance.
3002240	3006380	And then it cuts abruptly to the two of you at town hall,
3006380	3009940	rolling up in that sick DEA cruiser,
3009940	3014180	the self-driving Knight Rider DEA cruiser.
3014180	3015980	You've not been using that functionality
3015980	3016860	for whatever reason.
3016860	3020180	You have arrived at city hall.
3020180	3021020	Thank you, CopNet.
3021620	3024220	Does this have that brand new CopNet feature in it?
3024220	3026540	Yeah, I think it does, but really the main,
3026540	3029340	the shining beauty of this particular model
3029340	3031060	is the garphone.
3031060	3032140	Hey, have you eaten anything?
3032140	3032980	Are you hungry?
3032980	3034660	I was gonna go to the mecaduce,
3034660	3037540	but it scared me to even think about doing that.
3037540	3039220	I hand him a couple of moon pies.
3039220	3042340	I eat both of them very quickly.
3042340	3043160	Great.
3043160	3046140	And then I look at myself in like the mirror
3046140	3049100	and see is there like still purple around my mouth?
3049100	3050940	You could have wiped it off if you wanted to
3051820	3052660	or you can just walk around with that.
3052660	3055660	There is still purple around my mouth and I wipe it off.
3055660	3056620	And I guess theoretically,
3056620	3058660	as your tears were streaming down earlier,
3058660	3059620	as you were crying,
3059620	3063380	I've got like contact purple like streaks down my face.
3063380	3065660	A purple rain, if you will, down your face.
3066540	3068340	30 seconds of silence for Prince.
3070940	3072220	Fingerprints.
3072220	3073220	I barely knew him.
3074520	3075360	I'm surprised.
3075360	3080360	I'm surprised you didn't do any of that with Ryker yet.
3081700	3086700	Tan wipes the purple off his face and just looks over at Joe
3088340	3091420	and well, should we?
3091420	3093480	No, I kind of just wanted you to calm down.
3093480	3096260	I don't think their business is gonna take too long.
3096260	3099140	Why don't you eat another moon pie
3099140	3101540	and we'll wait for them to roll back into town.
3101540	3103660	After eating two moon pies,
3103660	3106620	he takes a third one and just like eats the marshmallow
3106620	3110460	out of the middle and then contently sits there.
3110820	3113380	You're gonna wait until they finish their business
3113380	3115260	out of town and presumably meet you there?
3115260	3118020	As soon as he eats the marshmallow out of the middle,
3118020	3121540	they hear a very distant faint gunshot.
3124020	3125660	Okay, they catch up to you.
3125660	3126980	You wait long enough,
3126980	3130220	a Ford Bronco comes speeding into town.
3130220	3134940	Cindy has dirt all over her cardigans.
3134940	3138180	Yeah, Harland's not as disheveled.
3138180	3140420	He's obviously tried to clean himself up a little bit
3140420	3141260	before getting here.
3141260	3144660	You see some really like dirty shovels in the back.
3144660	3146820	Joe takes Cindy aside.
3146820	3148620	How did Harland do?
3148620	3149560	He did great.
3149560	3152100	You eliminated Jane and the Vector.
3152100	3155500	Vector one down, 1,199 to go.
3157260	3158960	All right, well, the kid calmed down.
3158960	3160300	He's doing all right,
3160300	3162460	but we're gonna have to keep an eye on him.
3162460	3165220	All right, well, let's get going on to Merle's.
3165220	3167020	When you go back to the car,
3167020	3169560	you find Tan just like cleaning,
3169560	3172660	like taking apart and cleaning his 44.
3172660	3173900	He's prepared himself.
3173900	3176540	Should we go to his house or to his office?
3176540	3178500	Well, they said the aldermen never leave work.
3178500	3180420	Oh, he's an aldermen, that's right.
3180420	3182380	And that's where you met us.
3182380	3184060	So I get out of the car
3184060	3186100	and I go ring the doorbell of City Hall.
3187100	3192100	Where we are greeted by, what was her name?
3192120	3193020	Jennifer Kahn.
3193020	3195380	Jennifer Kahn.
3195380	3196220	Got it.
3197100	3199020	Yep, she's there at the front desk.
3199020	3199860	Just chilling.
3199860	3202140	I go pee real quick just in case, you know.
3202140	3204340	Hey, there's a bathroom right there.
3204340	3205300	Yes, just in case.
3205300	3207700	You are more than welcome to go to the bathroom.
3207700	3208540	And there's still a water.
3208540	3210420	Should I role play this out?
3210420	3211700	He walks into the bathroom.
3211700	3212980	Do you wash your hands?
3214180	3215140	He does not.
3215140	3217500	In for a penny, in for a pound.
3217500	3219780	In fairness, he didn't wash his hands
3219780	3221300	the first time you were in town hall
3221300	3224000	and then you shook hands with Bradley Allen
3224000	3227280	and it was wet and then you tried to lie.
3227280	3228560	It was horrible.
3228560	3229800	And he saw right through it.
3229800	3232100	Cindy loved that so much.
3233360	3235680	So everyone at this point is assuming
3235680	3236720	you didn't wash your hands.
3236720	3239160	So, you know, the aspect of the role play
3239160	3241400	is strictly if you want to make peace with the fact
3241400	3243560	that maybe you should start washing your hands
3243560	3245680	now that you have this stuff all over you.
3245680	3249080	He thinks about it, but then he just like
3249080	3251800	imagines purple flowing out of the sink
3251800	3253280	and he's like, no.
3253400	3254880	While you guys are waiting for him
3254880	3255800	to get back from the bathroom,
3255800	3258200	you look over and Harlan is gulping down
3258200	3259360	from the water fountain.
3263200	3264040	Harlan.
3264040	3265520	Harlan, Harlan, bud, bud, hey.
3265520	3266360	Oh, shit.
3266360	3267200	Oh, damn it.
3267200	3268560	Oh, and he starts wiping his mouth.
3268560	3270520	Sorry, I forgot.
3270520	3271360	Fuck.
3271360	3272360	Here, have another Coke.
3273480	3274320	Yeah.
3274320	3275640	Did you like Pavlov-ing him?
3277080	3279280	Gentlemen, the receptionist sees you.
3279280	3281680	Merle, Merle, we need Merle.
3281720	3283480	Let me, let me go get him.
3283480	3286160	Is there like a directory,
3286160	3289200	like a map directory thing on the wall anywhere?
3289200	3291000	All their offices are downstairs.
3291000	3292800	So you, if you remember,
3292800	3295760	you're going between the offices to see, you know,
3295760	3297680	which one had the evasive answers,
3297680	3300080	which one had the direct answers.
3300080	3301600	Those are all downstairs.
3301600	3303560	And there's actually one for each of the aldermen
3303560	3305280	that were mentioned kind of in that note.
3305280	3307800	So Merle has one, Bradley Allen.
3307800	3310160	So Jane's father had another,
3310160	3312880	that was the room you were in where he used his computer.
3312880	3314800	So that's one hallway downstairs.
3314800	3318400	Upstairs is like the conference room,
3318400	3321480	the big boardroom where all of like the aldermen
3321480	3323400	kind of bigger meetings happen.
3323400	3325480	And then kind of the other side of town hall
3325480	3328280	are the municipal things like the county court
3328280	3329400	and things like that.
3329400	3331880	Cindy pushes past Jennifer Kahn and says,
3331880	3333840	we know the way, sweetie, it's okay.
3333840	3336200	No, no, please don't.
3336200	3337200	No, no, no.
3337200	3339320	We actually like to talk to all the aldermen.
3339360	3340520	I know they're very busy.
3340520	3342680	It seems like they almost do nothing but work,
3342680	3344520	but we should have to take a moment of their time.
3344520	3347160	Do you guys wanna all flash our badges at the same time?
3347160	3348000	Yeah.
3348000	3349840	And we all flash our badges at the same time.
3349840	3350680	Flip, flip.
3350680	3351520	US Marshall.
3351520	3352360	I-T-A.
3352360	3353200	The E-A.
3353200	3356200	And what bureau are you with, remind us?
3356200	3359800	Oh, was that the, that was the county of Grover?
3359800	3362200	You're not in a bureau, that's right.
3362200	3364720	Okay, well, Cindy, lead the way.
3364720	3366600	I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
3366600	3368600	I'm gonna have to ask you to not.
3368640	3370200	All right, thank you.
3370200	3372000	Just to freak her out a little bit,
3372000	3375300	he remembers the name of the color of lipstick
3375300	3377320	that he found in her purse.
3377320	3380840	And he's like, oh, yeah.
3380840	3382720	That's so fucking creepy.
3382720	3386040	Coral reef looks real good on you.
3388560	3390240	And she just gets really, really quiet.
3390240	3391520	And we turn and walk.
3391520	3393120	And your arm too, right?
3393120	3394120	We have arms.
3394120	3395040	You're also, you're-
3395040	3395880	Two of them.
3396880	3400360	In my hand, I have my Magnum 40.
3400360	3404060	Oh my God, so much worse now.
3405000	3406080	That you demon put away
3406080	3407760	while you're going to the bathroom.
3407760	3409280	He's just kind of like,
3409280	3412880	he's like scratching his temple with like the muzzle.
3412880	3415480	And he's like, wow, Coral looks real good on you.
3415480	3417080	Oh, I hate it.
3417080	3420560	A little drip of piss falls off the barrel of the gun.
3420560	3423440	Jesus Christ.
3423440	3425640	Because you pissed in the barrel?
3426240	3427680	I was holding the gun while I pissed
3427680	3429840	and it just got a little bit on there.
3429840	3431200	Oh, we've all been there.
3432880	3435480	Plaques, go embarrass yourself before this is over.
3436680	3439360	So you sufficiently freak her out.
3439360	3441920	She stops in her tracks silently.
3441920	3444760	Why don't you lead the way, Ms. Khan?
3444760	3445600	I thought we were gonna-
3445600	3446920	I said we knew where we were going.
3446920	3448800	Yeah, we're going to Merle's office.
3448800	3450360	Cindy.
3450360	3451200	Are we going to Merle's office?
3451200	3452760	I just feel like she's kind of on his end.
3452760	3454440	They're all upstairs.
3454680	3455920	The offices are all empty.
3455920	3457160	They all seem to be upstairs.
3457160	3459600	Just like last night, if you remember.
3459600	3461840	Bradley Allen came down from that room
3461840	3463480	and based on what she said here,
3463480	3465240	she's saying like they're upstairs.
3465240	3466080	Yeah, we go upstairs.
3466080	3467440	Yeah, we go upstairs.
3467440	3468440	Okay.
3468440	3470560	You get to the conference room.
3470560	3473140	It's double doors, double wooden doors,
3473140	3476560	labeled Aldermen Conference Room.
3476560	3477720	Pretty straightforward.
3477720	3479320	Hello, Aldermans.
3479320	3480440	Should we knock?
3480440	3482360	No, the door's open, we walk in.
3483200	3485240	Okay.
3485240	3486400	You walk in and you see a couple.
3486400	3487400	And I knock anyway.
3488560	3490400	You knock as you walk in.
3490400	3491240	It's polite.
3491240	3493240	Yeah, and I ring the doorbell and ring, ring.
3493240	3496540	It is polite to call ahead, in particular,
3496540	3498600	when you're ambushing a bunch of Aldermen.
3499760	3501200	Especially in this instance,
3501200	3503380	because as you open the door,
3503380	3506000	you notice presumably what the conference table was
3506000	3508720	in the middle of the room has been hacked into pieces.
3508720	3510400	And those pieces have been put up,
3510440	3512600	basically boarding up the walls.
3512600	3515080	All the bookshelves are turned over.
3515080	3518480	The bookshelves are also used to block the windows.
3518480	3521880	There's very little light coming into this room.
3521880	3523160	And in the center of the room,
3523160	3528120	occupying almost half the floor is a big pile of goo.
3529200	3532920	And that big pile of goo has about eight bodies
3532920	3534720	extending out of it.
3534720	3538220	You see legs kind of coming out of the bottom,
3538220	3540900	some arms, a few heads.
3540900	3543580	They look like suited humans,
3543580	3546180	just stuck in this pile of goo.
3546180	3548260	And this is a metallic goo,
3548260	3552300	very similar to the stuff from the water supply.
3552300	3553680	And outside of that,
3553680	3555780	the only other thing you see in this room
3555780	3558080	is a very high-tech looking computer,
3559460	3561580	up against the wall, plugged in,
3561580	3564180	and also wired into the internet,
3564180	3567240	in a giant pile of metallic goo.
3568220	3571740	Uh, excuse me, Aldermen,
3571740	3573040	could we interrupt your meeting
3573040	3574540	to ask you a few questions?
3574540	3579540	I gotta work in the morning,
3590340	3593240	and this shit's so important,
3593240	3595840	so I can't get high.
3595840	3597300	Can't get high.
3597300	3599560	No, I can't get high.
3599560	3600900	Can't get high.
3601900	3606900	I thought this stuff helped anxiety.
3606900	3609900	It must be something inside of me.
3609900	3613900	Does anybody know why?
3613900	3617900	I can't get high.
