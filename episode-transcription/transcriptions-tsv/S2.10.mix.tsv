0	7920	Allow me to introduce myself for any new listener who happened upon our show during this new
7920	17760	series of stories, or any old listener who is confused about whom or what I am.
17760	20340	I am Wolf the Dog.
20340	23120	I am the DJ.
23120	33560	We broadcast live from 694.2 PTBP, the best radio station that ever was and shall be,
33560	39440	alongside my producer and my dog, Wolf the Dog.
39440	46780	You are my listeners, my special wolf pack, my pepperonis.
46780	49720	You listen intently whenever I speak.
49720	55540	You give me your love, your energy, your spoiled goods.
55540	58800	You gaze into the void that is my maw.
58800	60800	You feel comfort.
60800	69320	I give you an endless amount of content, a recap of whatever happened whenever I am in
69320	76580	the last little while, a new song by a new artist every week, and I sometimes read the
76580	82180	things you write towards me in our segment called Howlin' with Wolf.
82180	89680	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Mads, at Medusa, but it's spelt all funny, who proudly
89680	93140	hails from Sacramento, California.
93140	99900	They tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod, a thing you can also do if
99900	102100	you have a Twitter account.
102100	103500	Mads writes,
103620	104860	Hi, Wolf.
104860	111500	This one goes out to the Neo Scum Discord and all the nasty little freaks in there whom
111500	114100	I love more than I can put into words.
114100	119820	Heck, I got matching tattoos with a bunch of you and I think that says it all.
119820	127060	I refuse to give Cameron the satisfaction of a shout out by another scummer for getting
127060	132940	so many of us to turn the dial to 694.2 PTBP.
132940	134300	You hear that, Cam?
134300	135300	Wait, shit.
135300	136300	Wolf, cut that part.
136300	139780	I can bribe you with some primo trash juice.
139780	141500	Listen to Neo Scum.
141500	143460	Neo Scum good.
143460	145740	Anyway, here's Wonderwall.
145740	160260	Hmm, Mads, Mads, Mads, Mads, trying to bribe me of all entities with trash juice?
160260	167900	You think it's so simple to sway the emotions of a being such as I with such simple pleasures
167900	170500	as primo trash juice?
170500	173100	Well, you'd think right.
173100	178500	Send that stanky dranky over here in at least a five gallon bucket.
178500	185500	And don't you ever mention Wonderwall ever again.
185500	190380	If you want to write up something for your wolf to how, tag at pretending pod on Twitter

256220	258460	It's time for the news.
258460	265580	Last time we caught up with the crew of the death of a salesman, Wavy Adler, Mr. Edward
265580	271920	Spitz, Alabasta, Al Chernobog, and Dr. Shark.
271920	277340	Now please imagine that meme where the girl explains things.
277340	283740	So Wavy Adler is the ship's navigator, its eyes, while Mr. Spitz brings a bit of class
283740	286420	to the pirate vessel, okay?
286420	292340	Al Chernobog has a monkey and dripping open lesions all over.
292340	300020	Also Dr. Shark was the saw bones, even sawed a leg off the cabin boy, Jurgen Stick, and
300020	302780	got him fit for a peg leg.
302780	309140	That gave Jurgen half the peg legs Dr. Shark left sticking out of the quicksand that had
309140	316540	just consumed the dread pirate neck beard when he dove in head first to his single episode
316540	319280	appearance based demise.
319280	320500	Got all that?
320500	321500	Good.
321500	328860	Join us now, back to the action on this island with a big ol' statue of a humanoid alligator
328860	335780	and multiple narrow ditches filled with blood that seem to run all along the beach.
335780	340860	It's R.I. Peter with Cruisin'!
365780	395100	Oh, his feet ache, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my
425100	426100	gosh.
426100	430520	Is that like a, of course you were thinking about how much fun you would have there so
430520	431520	you laughed.
431520	433760	All of our listeners are in Hillsong, that are in Australia.
433760	434760	Really?
434760	435760	Yeah.
435760	436760	Is Hillsong the name of a town?
436760	439960	Yeah, on Patreon when it says location Australia Hillsong.
439960	440960	Damn.
440960	443320	It's the name of the country now actually.
443320	444320	The whole country is Hillsong.
444320	447060	Yeah, ever since that documentary came out and, the sound of music?
447060	448060	Yeah.
448060	451360	There were Nazis the whole time.
451360	452720	Those were Hillsongs, right?
452720	454140	Yes, they were.
454660	457420	The Hills have songs.
457420	459420	These hills have songs.
459420	462020	These hills are alive with the sound of music.
462020	464020	What did the guy say in Jason?
464020	465020	Friday the 13th?
465020	466020	It's a blood curse!
466020	467020	It's a blood curse!
467020	468020	It's a blood curse!
468020	469020	It's a blood curse!
469020	470020	It's a blood curse!
470020	472020	Shut up Ralph, you son of a bitch.
472020	475420	You stupid fucking crazy bastard.
475420	476420	Right off in the wrong way on a bike.
476420	480220	You ought to be lucky the mental asylum fucking closed down or you'd be getting beat every
480220	481780	day by Nurse Ratched.
481780	484100	What was the captain of the neck beards name?
484100	485100	Captain Neckbeard.
485100	486100	Captain Neckbeard.
486100	487100	Was that it?
487100	488100	Yes.
488100	489100	Nice.
489100	492300	Yeah, remember we're going serious this time.
492300	495580	Captain Neckbeard's dead, the rest of it's serious.
495580	501860	The peg legs finally stop moving.
501860	511500	The bubbles rising above where the dread pirate neck beard had gone under have ceased to bubble.
511500	514900	And the crew from Neckbeard's ship ties their belts together.
514900	516540	Wait, all together?
516540	519380	Like to each other?
519380	520380	Like in a circle?
520380	521380	Yeah.
521380	522380	Yep, to each other.
522380	525340	This is gonna be tough crap boys.
525340	530940	And then they hold each other's shoulders and begin walking back toward the beach.
530940	533860	Are you Neckbeard's?
533860	535860	You wait right there.
535860	536860	Okay.
536860	539740	Your captain just killed our doctor with his stupidity.
539740	542100	Yeah, I'm real sorry about that.
542100	543820	Wish YU is a doctor.
543820	550260	The three of them all look at each other and let's roll luck, 50-50 shot up and down.
550260	553780	Roll under, one of them's a doctor.
553780	554780	10.
554780	555780	10.
555780	557260	That's a success.
557260	558260	Is that a 10 or a 100?
558260	559260	It's a 10.
559260	560260	I can't see what the-
560260	561260	It's a 10.
561260	562260	No, 100 is all zeros.
562260	563260	All zeros, yeah.
563260	564260	It's a 10.
564260	565260	It's a 10!
565260	566260	Yeah!
566260	567260	And I was actually gonna say-
567260	568860	He's a fucking medical chap.
568860	570860	Yeah, I actually-
570860	573940	And the other two kind of move, try to shuffle behind him.
573940	574940	But again-
574940	577940	Yeah, they're all tied together by the belts.
577940	581260	And so one of them's like, hey, it's schooling.
581260	582260	He's lots of schooling.
582260	584340	You should take him.
584340	585340	I do sir.
585340	587620	I have lots of schooling in medicine.
587620	591380	I have 100 minus whatever you rolled is what I was gonna say.
591380	592380	What's your name?
592380	593380	I'm very, very skilled.
593380	594380	What is your name?
594380	595380	Jammin.
595380	596380	Jammin?
596420	597420	Jammin?
597420	599420	Did you say, uh, Shammin?
599420	600420	Did you say Jermaine?
600420	601420	Yeah.
601420	605660	How do you say it, sir?
605660	607540	You're asking us to tell you how to say your name?
607540	608540	Yes.
608540	609540	I'm very scared right now.
609540	610540	I think it's Jimmy.
610540	611640	All right, Jimmy.
611640	612640	He nods.
612640	614940	You're coming with us.
614940	619940	And he nods and he slowly looks down at his rope belt, which is tied to the others.
619940	625700	You're all coming with us.
625700	627020	Which one of you is the sword guy?
627020	629020	I mean, I've got swords.
629020	630020	Okay.
630020	632180	I'll swing to try and cut him free from the other two.
632180	633180	Oh, cool.
633180	634860	Which one of you would be more likely to do a cool, yeah.
634860	638940	I have like a knife that I can just cut the rope with.
638940	640220	Who would do it cool?
640220	641220	We're pirates.
641220	644380	Mine's, mine's got a octopus beak on it.
644380	645380	Can you beat that?
645380	646380	How about this?
646380	647380	How about this?
647380	648820	We're going to have to cut it twice to get him out.
648820	649820	You know?
649820	650820	Oh, he's the one in the middle.
650820	651820	Okay.
651820	652820	Yeah.
652940	653940	We'll throw at the same time.
653940	656100	We'll show off these sword tricks.
656100	660380	And if you don't do a good job, well then the doctor gets to show us how good his skills
660380	663220	are, don't we?
663220	664220	Don't pass mine.
664220	665220	Oh, I pass mine.
665220	667500	28 on a 70.
667500	672460	Wavy pulls out his sword and he forgets to get the scabbard out, get it out of the scabbard,
672460	674900	so he just hits the rope with the scabbard.
674900	678540	That's embarrassing.
678540	685500	He just reaches down and cuts the other side and looks at alabaster owl and is like, oh,
685500	689460	it made me very nervous, sir.
689460	693460	Alabaster stares at him for a second with like a questioning look and then he, he looks
693460	694980	over at Mr. Spitz.
694980	698980	Why, uh, why are we taking him again?
698980	700620	He's a fucking sawbones, ain't he?
700620	705220	Oh, is this not a deadly pirate competition fraught with danger?
705220	707180	I forgot we lost our doctor.
707220	713420	The rest of you, uh, go wade into the quicksand.
713420	715500	The other two give you like massive eyes.
715500	717780	Wait, there's only two other crew members?
717780	718780	Yeah.
718780	719780	Okay.
719780	720780	I, yeah.
720780	722700	Then I like, I'm not intimidated at all.
722700	724980	I'm like expecting them to just wade into the quicksand.
724980	725980	No.
725980	726980	Oh God.
726980	727980	No.
727980	730160	If we could actually just go back to the ship, that'd be great.
730160	732500	Just knee deep and you were here.
732500	733500	Yeah.
733500	735300	Maybe some more neck pads will come along.
735420	737180	Maybe the jungle will take you.
737180	741100	I don't think that we're gonna go anywhere without our captain.
741100	743100	We're also supposed to, your captain's dead.
743100	744100	Yes.
744100	745100	So we're gonna leave, I guess.
745100	750100	Uh, no, but you'll get back on the ship and try to fight us later cause the whole thing's
750100	751460	a fight or something.
751460	754580	So you need to get in the quicksand.
754580	759140	You don't have to go all the way neck deep or, you know, head deep as your captain did,
759140	760500	but you need to stay there.
760500	763620	So fucking walk into the quicksand now.
763620	764620	Eye roll, persuade.
764620	769140	Sometimes it sounds like you're speaking with another man's words, but it really found
769140	770140	like you found your voice there.
770140	772140	Yeah, mine are bad on all this.
772140	773140	Mine are bad.
773140	774140	I got 15% intimidate.
774140	775140	Oh my God.
775140	776140	I rolled 100.
776140	785260	Okay, they're both going to push past you physically.
785260	788540	Like they're both going to shoulder check you as they walk past.
788540	793580	And then basically as soon as they get past, they are going to run as fast as they can.
793580	794580	What do you do?
794580	796860	I throw one of my iron grenades at them.
796860	797860	Jesus Christ.
797860	800020	How many of those do you have?
800020	806180	I literally, I like make them in the base or in the basement of the ship, which is called
806180	807180	the?
807180	808180	Anybody?
808180	809180	The belly.
809180	810180	The death of a salesman.
810180	811180	Yeah, I don't know what it is either.
811180	812180	The belly of the death of a salesman.
812180	815700	Not the ship's name, but what is the basement of the ship called?
815700	816700	The under deck.
816700	817700	There's a number of different things.
817700	818700	The inside.
818700	819700	Below deck.
819700	820700	I make it below deck.
820700	822700	Yeah, basically you make it inside the ship.
823260	825220	Can I roll heavy weapons on that?
825220	826220	Yeah.
826220	827220	Tight.
827220	828220	Yeah, that's six.
828220	829220	Okay.
829220	830220	Yeah.
830220	831220	As these two run off.
831220	832220	Can I tell you what happens with a grenade?
832220	833220	Please tell me what happens with a grenade.
833220	836660	They bump into me and like shoulder check me and without even looking, I just kind of
836660	843460	like throw it behind me and it doinks one of them in the, in the head and then it lands
843460	845220	in front of them and they look down for a second.
845220	852660	They look at each other and then you see these two bodies just kind of a red mist, it dissipates
852660	859140	onto the leaves and all the foliage around as, as limbs just kind of fly around and the
859140	864020	rest of you kind of turn around and you see that Mitch has taken his rope, everybody's
864020	870580	got a rope and has been pulling out the body of Dr. Shark this whole time.
870580	876020	He kind of got it around one of the peg legs and is pulled enough to where the whole body
876020	881260	is coming out now and you see that Dr. Shark's head and specifically the ears are just completely
881260	886320	caked with this quicksand and it is just packed in around the head.
886320	890460	And then there were four or five, I don't, I'm not really clear on how many are competing
890460	891460	in this.
891460	894700	Well, we lost one doctor, but then we gained another and Jimmy so.
894700	897540	But I mean the neckbeards are, the team is gone, right?
897540	903340	Do we represent an advanced body of our crew or are they more aboard?
903340	908380	It's like the captains of a football team coming out for the coin toss.
908380	909900	We've crippled their leadership.
909940	914860	Yeah, actually guys, this works out really well for you, no spoilers.
914860	920820	He walks deeper into the forest jungle of this island and as he does, he turns around
920820	926300	one of these trees that's in the distance and seems to be grabbing at something.
926300	932700	And then as you approach, you see that he's putting on a cloak, like a black hooded cloak
932700	941260	and it goes over his entire body and covers his head or over his eyes, Jedi style, but
941260	948420	it is both short, it's short sleeved and it's, uh, it only comes up to about his thighs.
948420	950140	You started motioning with your hands.
950140	954460	No, I really thought you were going to like describe it as a crop top.
954460	957000	Oh, that's my bad.
957000	959820	It's absolutely a crop top.
959820	963940	He actually removes his shirt before he puts on this crop top robe.
963940	965260	He can be wearing it.
965260	969380	They're going to be so angry if they found out that I wasn't wearing this before.
969380	972940	So if you could just not say anything, that'd be awesome.
972940	975300	And now you look good.
975300	977460	What would you even call a garment like that?
977460	983900	Oh, it's a, it's a crude, it's, it's a crude, like the movie, the crew.
983900	984900	Yeah, it's a crudy.
984900	985900	I love that movie.
985900	990440	I saw it with my daughter that I don't have, cause it's my dream to have one.
990440	992540	I thought about this movie that could be made.
992540	993540	I like the backstory.
993540	996820	How you became a Beatle.
996820	998420	When I get, it's my dream.
998420	1002900	When I talk about my dreams, I think about me, favorite band, the world that could be
1002900	1006180	my whole band and the favorite, my whole favorite band in the world.
1006180	1007180	They sing.
1007180	1015460	When I start to imagine, what should we do with the Eleanor Rigby, throw a silver lining.
1015460	1019900	We shave a belly with a rusty razor.
1019900	1024660	I raised the sails today, oh boy.
1024660	1026660	And you guys walk further and further in.
1026660	1032700	And as you're walking, you can see that, that pillar of smoke in the distance that you're
1032700	1039400	walking toward, but you, you approach a clearing far before this, this pillar of smoke that's
1039400	1040400	in the distance.
1040400	1045340	And in this clearing, we've established that we have tied Jimmy up and are leading them
1045340	1048660	by his belt and the slashed belts of his comrades.
1048660	1049660	You have now.
1049660	1050660	Yes, absolutely.
1050660	1052780	And how are you transporting the body of Dr. Shark?
1052780	1054180	I thought Mitch was on that.
1054180	1055180	Yeah.
1055180	1056580	He's just been dragging the body.
1056580	1059820	I didn't understand why he wanted it, but I, he said it would be advantageous.
1059820	1063500	He just kind of kept the rope tied around it and just continues to drag it and he's
1063500	1070900	just like, okay guys, Hey, I just want to say, um, before we get in there, you guys
1070900	1071900	seem really cool.
1071900	1075940	So I'm really rooting for you and I hope you win.
1075940	1076940	Well, thank you, Mitch.
1076940	1077940	That means a lot.
1077940	1087740	Well, you're not going to, sorry, happy birthday, happy birthday, I didn't know it was your
1087740	1088740	birthday, Mitch.
1088740	1089900	Happy birthday.
1089900	1097380	It's one of the Beatles birthdays, dude, just be a beetle, a beetle.
1097380	1101100	You were doing the Australian, totally nailing it.
1101100	1108220	You were in the, in the flow state, listen to his happy birthday, happy, happy birthday.
1108220	1113780	I got to think about a guy that's really excited to talk about things and you're all back in
1113780	1114780	it.
1114780	1120780	I just got to be really excited about anything.
1120780	1126100	Jimmy, are you not going to be our doctor?
1126100	1128540	He's not excited about Jimmy not being a doctor.
1128540	1129540	He's sad about it.
1129980	1132900	Jimmy, are you going to be our doctor?
1132900	1139740	My character asks Jimmy if he's going to be the doctor, uh, with his blade brandished.
1139740	1145780	Jimmy smiles a wry smile that says that he's not intimidated by you at all.
1145780	1146780	It can't be trusted.
1146780	1147780	Wait, wait, wait.
1147780	1152420	The intimidation rule failed, but then he obliterated those two dudes.
1152420	1153420	You're absolutely right.
1153420	1154420	You're absolutely right.
1154420	1155420	We're still covered.
1155420	1158380	Our backs are red with their blood.
1158420	1159420	I'm so sorry.
1159420	1167300	His lips tremble as he's like, whatever doctor you need to be, sir, anything that, you know,
1167300	1168940	what's blood do?
1168940	1169940	Yeah.
1169940	1170940	What's blood?
1170940	1171940	You tell us.
1171940	1172940	I've always wondered that myself.
1172940	1173940	What does blood do, doc?
1173940	1174940	It flows.
1174940	1175940	Why does it flow?
1175940	1177860	Don't get clever with us.
1177860	1180940	The brain makes it pump through the entire body.
1180940	1182740	It's from your brain.
1182740	1186420	That's where we think all of our thoughts and it's where all of our emotions come from.
1186460	1188380	All right, then come from my belly.
1188380	1189380	I believe him.
1189380	1190980	He'll be a good doctor.
1190980	1196780	Then I cut his vocal cords so he can't talk to us anymore.
1196780	1198780	Are you intimidated now?
1198780	1207980	I thought you were going to kill him so you didn't have to play this character.
1207980	1210020	No, you should have a doctor.
1210020	1215020	Oh, I thought you were, I thought you were going to be like, so I got to leave smiling
1215020	1216020	because you failed.
1216020	1217020	You're an intimidation checker here.
1217020	1218020	Oh, okay.
1218020	1219020	I'm an idiot then.
1219020	1220020	I don't know.
1220020	1221020	Thomas was right though.
1221020	1222020	He's totally intimidated now.
1222020	1223020	Yeah.
1223020	1224020	Yeah, especially with his vocal cords cut.
1224020	1225020	Yeah.
1225020	1232860	And I realized, Alabaster realizes, wow, I can't believe I did surgery on his vocal cords.
1232860	1233860	Maybe I'm a doctor.
1233860	1234860	Let's not.
1234860	1236580	I mean, do we want to do that or not?
1236580	1237580	I don't want to.
1237580	1238580	That's too ridiculous.
1238580	1239580	Okay.
1239580	1240580	Yeah.
1240580	1241580	Yeah.
1241580	1244180	Okay guys, let's um, let's go into the tower.
1244340	1245900	Wait, is that Mitch or Jimmy?
1245900	1246900	I'm Mitch.
1246900	1252140	Jimmy talks like this sir, with his lips quivering and he always says sir at the end, sir.
1252140	1256940	I'm Mitch and uh, we're going to the tower now, are you ready?
1256940	1261020	Is the tower where the smoke's coming from or was that the thing we saw back at the beach?
1261020	1264260	No, the tower is actually neither of those things.
1264260	1265260	Oh my.
1265260	1266260	Come with me.
1266260	1268540	Should we be wearing a crude like you?
1268540	1276660	And he opens up like a, uh, Oh, like a bead curtain, but it's a leaves and vines and stuff.
1276660	1282860	And he opens it up into this clearing and you see, uh, you see another ditch immediately
1282860	1285620	as soon as you're on the other side of the clearing.
1285620	1288180	And this ditch is not filled with blood.
1288180	1292760	It's filled with a clear liquid that one might assume is water.
1292760	1297280	And that's not the only different thing about this ditch.
1297280	1304840	This one, you can actually see where it continues on either side and it goes in a large circle,
1304840	1309880	which is the circle of this clearing that exists here in the middle of this island in
1309880	1310880	the jungle.
1310880	1312600	So is it like right next to the edge of the trees and stuff?
1312600	1313600	Yes.
1313600	1314600	It's a moat on the edge of the trees.
1314600	1315600	Yeah.
1315600	1322640	And just inside of that moat, uh, you see another moat and another and another, and
1322640	1326880	they get smaller and smaller as they would as they go inside.
1326880	1328920	And some are filled with water.
1328920	1331040	Some are filled with blood.
1331040	1342520	And Mitch, uh, turns you guys in, he's like, Oh yes, be mindful of the waterways and be
1342520	1353280	mindful of, uh, the gutters and the trenches, all of these canals.
1353280	1360640	And he looks out and in the middle of all of these pools, you see, there are a few other
1360640	1364280	crudy wearing folks.
1364280	1369760	There are three mean pirate camp counselors, mean pirate.
1369760	1370760	I haven't seen this movie.
1370760	1380120	It's going to be hard to, wait, what movie pirate camp doesn't exist, but we'll make
1380120	1381120	it.
1381960	1382960	Pirate camp.
1382960	1389760	You best stop leaving in pirate summer camps, you're in one.
1389760	1390760	All right.
1390760	1392600	Blue team to ultimate frisbee.
1392600	1399560	One of them says from their crudy, no, I was so glad you said no, no, no, no.
1399560	1403080	Mitch, Mitch gets really serious and is like, come this way.
1403080	1408760	Wavy picks up what, what he's laying down and of course, master Mitch, I mean, master
1408760	1411360	mysterious man, we will follow the lead.
1411360	1414760	I've never had this guy's name ever in my life.
1414760	1422680	The three crudy wearing folks turn and you see the tallest one has this like huge, massive
1422680	1423680	jaw.
1423680	1430040	And from underneath his hood, when, when you say that about Mitch, he gets a big smile
1430040	1434880	on his face and the other two are still hidden by their crudy hoods.
1435600	1439760	Are we talking like a strong jaw or like, like a radium lipstick?
1439760	1442640	Like looks like you, you're not human kind of job.
1442640	1443640	Oh, sorry.
1443640	1444640	Human jaw.
1444640	1445640	My bad.
1445640	1446640	We're playing pulp Cthulhu.
1446640	1447640	It's a human.
1447640	1448640	I know it's human.
1448640	1452960	It's not like, like you'd look at them and be like your jaws five times the size of somebody
1452960	1458080	else's jaw, a monstrous job, alligator men.
1458080	1461600	Hey, that's a real good point.
1461600	1463720	So just like a chiseled jaw.
1464720	1465720	It's like a chiseled jaw.
1465720	1466720	Nice.
1466720	1469720	So there's a real Chad in a, uh, a chode.
1469720	1470720	What are we chud?
1470720	1472720	We've got a Chad in a chud.
1472720	1475720	It's real Chad in a chode.
1475720	1481720	Mitch is leading the three of you as well as the body of Dr. Shark and Jimmy.
1481720	1483720	The five of us.
1483720	1486720	We're going to a weekend at Bernie's, Dr. Shark.
1487720	1495720	And as you guys walk toward the center, you do see that there are five pools placed around
1495720	1496720	the circle.
1496720	1502720	The largest of these moats connects all five of these pools of water.
1502720	1511720	And you would see that currently three of these pools are unvacant.
1516720	1517720	Full.
1517720	1518720	Not empty.
1518720	1519720	Taken.
1519720	1522720	They're lacking the emptiness.
1522720	1524720	Occupied, full.
1524720	1527720	Three of these pools are wet.
1527720	1528720	Yes.
1528720	1529720	Like filled with water.
1529720	1530720	Filled with people.
1530720	1536720	Uh, there are human bodies in three of them and the other two are empty.
1536720	1543720	They are laying flat on their backs with their ears in the water, but their eyes and nose
1543720	1545720	and mouth above water.
1546720	1547720	Oh.
1547720	1551720	From the distance here, can I see if any of them are alive or are they all dead on their
1551720	1552720	backs?
1552720	1556720	Go ahead and roll a medical check for intelligence.
1556720	1558720	You're going intelligence?
1558720	1562720	It's an eight on a intelligence of 70.
1562720	1563720	Yeah, that'll do it.
1563720	1564720	These three people are breathing.
1564720	1565720	All three of them.
1565720	1566720	Oh, it's only three.
1566720	1568720	I thought each pool had a number of bodies in there.
1568720	1569720	Yeah.
1569720	1572720	I was imagining like bodies stacked on top of each other.
1572720	1573720	Oh, my bad.
1573720	1574720	Sorry.
1574720	1575720	One person per pool.
1575720	1576720	One person per pool.
1576720	1577720	Not pools full of bodies.
1577720	1578720	Nope.
1578720	1582720	These pools are only big enough for one body to lay flat, almost like a pod.
1582720	1583720	Gotcha.
1583720	1588720	So full of bodies means that there are three holes filled with three bodies.
1588720	1590720	There are three pods.
1590720	1593720	Three pods full, two pods empty.
1593720	1594720	Okay.
1594720	1595720	They can't.
1595720	1598720	Do these people in the pods look like pirates to us?
1598720	1599720	Yeah.
1599720	1601720	Edward Spitz does not cross himself for three bodies.
1601720	1602720	He spits.
1605720	1607720	Well, they all certainly seem relaxed.
1607720	1612720	Well, yeah, because he hasn't communicated that he knows that they're breathing, I take
1612720	1617720	a little bit of gunpowder out of my pocket and flick it on one of their faces to see
1617720	1619720	if it moves with their breath.
1619720	1623720	As you walk over there, the tall man in the middle says,
1623720	1627720	Hey, Cielo, could you please not?
1627720	1630720	If you could come this way, we must begin.
1630720	1631720	He might much look bad.
1631720	1633720	I keep the gunpowder in my pocket.
1634720	1636720	And then I do what he asked me to do.
1636720	1643720	We have spaced out this process between the crews in order to keep the violence offshore.
1643720	1647720	Each crew will be given an orator.
1647720	1649720	Each orator?
1649720	1653720	And as he says orator, he motions at each side of him.
1653720	1661720	Each orator will be positioned at the stern of each ship with only their barrel and their
1661720	1662720	words.
1662720	1666720	And he points and you see two barrels kind of at the edge of the jungle.
1666720	1667720	Like a wine barrel?
1667720	1669720	Yep, a full big wine barrel.
1669720	1676720	Each orator will be positioned at the stern of each ship with only their barrel and their
1676720	1677720	words.
1677720	1683720	In order to win the competition, your orator must not be interrupted.
1683720	1689720	A steady stream must come from both their mouth and their bong hole.
1689720	1698720	The first crew to sail in a complete circle around the island will win a job that will
1698720	1703720	earn so much wealth it would embarrass the queen.
1703720	1713720	But each crew must leave a deposit here to ensure the safe return of our orators.
1713720	1718720	And we just found out how you were originally going to have Beth May leave the podcast.
1718720	1727720	It's a really good thing we kidnapped a bloke.
1727720	1733720	Mitch, kind of out of the corner of his mouth is like, maybe keep your doctor and use the
1733720	1734720	body.
1734720	1736720	It's smart, we really could burn, is it?
1736720	1737720	Yeah.
1737720	1743720	I pull a pair of pretty rad sunglasses out from my coat pocket and slip it on Dr. Shark.
1743720	1745720	What are your sunglasses?
1745720	1751720	They are how you disguise a body that is dead and make it look like it's alive and having
1751720	1753720	a fun time all weekend.
1753720	1754720	Two eye patches?
1754720	1757720	Well, it's something that Alabaster was asked to make.
1757720	1759720	What year did you say this was?
1759720	1760720	I think there are sunglasses.
1760720	1765720	I think Keith Richards wears them in the pirate movie.
1765720	1773720	No, Dr. Spitz asked me, Mr. Spitz asked me to make something to block the sun and I made
1774720	1783720	out of broken brown bottles, I crafted you some Oakley looking futuristic glasses.
1783720	1791720	So I put those on me and then out of Dr. Shark's 1920s coat jacket, I pull a pair of sunglasses
1791720	1793720	and put them on Dr. Shark.
1793720	1795720	It works.
1795720	1800720	Look at this contraption I found, it'll block the eyes, you can't see the maggots coming
1800720	1802720	out of them.
1803720	1805720	This will be your orator.
1805720	1811720	He motions to one of the two crudy wearing folk and she begins to walk.
1811720	1813720	Shotgun Mitch, we shawty Mitch.
1813720	1814720	We'd like to have Mitch as our...
1814720	1815720	We want Mitch.
1815720	1816720	Mitch, Mitch, he's our man.
1816720	1817720	Mr. Mystery Men.
1817720	1819720	If they can't do it, no one can.
1819720	1822720	I'm excited so, no, I'm not excited so I'm talking like this.
1822720	1828720	Mitch and the woman who moved forward to be your orator both turn and look at the tall
1828720	1830720	man and the crudy.
1831720	1838720	Mitch, do you know the words?
1838720	1840720	Mitch, do you know the words?
1840720	1841720	Sir, I do.
1841720	1843720	I put a gun to Mitch's back.
1843720	1847720	I whisper in his ear, do you know the words, boy?
1847720	1848720	Very cool.
1848720	1853720	He turns back and he's talking to you while the large man is talking.
1853720	1856720	Mitch whispers like, yes, very quickly.
1856720	1863720	And the large man says, well, then if you would like to go with him, you may.
1863720	1864720	We'd love to have you.
1864720	1872720	Oh, that's like the words that Mitch has been wanting to hear his entire life.
1872720	1877720	He turns in like his hood bounces kind of off of his head a little bit as he turns and
1877720	1882720	flashes you just a massive smile full of warmth and joy.
1882720	1887720	And he turns back and he says, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll do it.
1887720	1889720	Sure, sure.
1889720	1891720	I can do it.
1891720	1893720	I'm proud of you, son.
1893720	1902720	While this is happening, I like discreetly in one of his hands give him one of my grenades
1902720	1903720	for later.
1903720	1907720	To kill yourself if you can't do it and the shame is too much.
1907720	1910720	No, for protection later maybe or to help us.
1910720	1911720	From the shame.
1912720	1916720	Can Waverly clock the other person?
1916720	1921720	So we've got big man, woman, clock the other person and see if I see a familiar relation
1921720	1922720	between all of them.
1922720	1923720	Cool.
1923720	1924720	Is that spot hidden?
1924720	1925720	Yeah.
1925720	1928720	It's a 38 and I got that special thing.
1928720	1929720	So let's see if I roll better.
1929720	1930720	Nope.
1930720	1931720	Did you pass?
1931720	1932720	Did you pass?
1932720	1933720	Yeah, pass.
1933720	1934720	Sorry, pass on the first one.
1934720	1935720	Rad.
1935720	1936720	Yeah.
1936720	1937720	So this is the Diggory family.
1937720	1939720	You recognize the Diggory family.
1939720	1940720	Cedric Diggory?
1940720	1941720	Holy shit.
1941720	1942720	They're wearing robes too.
1942720	1944720	I didn't even think of that.
1944720	1946720	Are we going to fight a dragon?
1946720	1950720	No, but Voldemort's going to kill you.
1950720	1954720	The Diggory family is extremely well known.
1954720	1955720	Oh shit.
1955720	1960720	Very, very wealthy and have been missing for some time.
1960720	1962720	Do we know of a Mitch Diggory?
1962720	1964720	Oh, the Diggory family.
1964720	1965720	Doc.
1965720	1967720	The person.
1967720	1969720	The Diggory family, Robinson.
1969720	1972720	The Diggory family doc is where we're parked.
1972720	1975720	Yeah, that is where we're parked.
1975720	1976720	Incredible.
1976720	1981720	I love the idea of a very wealthy family all out here in their shitty fucking crop top
1981720	1982720	hoodies.
1982720	1983720	Yep.
1983720	1984720	Like putting on pirate games.
1984720	1985720	Am I imagining this wrong?
1985720	1986720	They've got a hood, right?
1986720	1987720	Yep.
1987720	1988720	But their face is a little bit shown.
1988720	1991720	Yeah, their eyes are being covered for the most part.
1991720	1992720	Got it.
1992720	1993720	Except for-
1993720	1994720	This is hilarious.
1995720	2001720	As far as age goes, it's mother, father, and then brother and or sister.
2001720	2002720	We haven't clocked to the third one.
2002720	2004720	Yeah, the other one is a sister.
2004720	2005720	Okay.
2005720	2007720	So mother, father, son.
2007720	2012720	I know you said they were black hoodies or a black hood, but I'm just picturing Heather
2012720	2013720	Grey.
2013720	2015720	I don't know who Heather Grey is.
2015720	2016720	The color?
2016720	2017720	The color.
2017720	2018720	I'm kidding.
2018720	2019720	I was confused.
2019720	2022720	I thought that was Grey's Anatomy name or something.
2022720	2024720	That's Dr. Grey.
2024720	2028720	Yeah, but her sister is maybe Helen.
2028720	2031720	There is a tension hanging in the air right now.
2031720	2033720	Are we the last to arrive?
2033720	2034720	No, actually.
2034720	2039720	And he clocks that your doctor is from a seemingly different crew based on spatial hair.
2039720	2041720	Because he's got a neck beard.
2041720	2048720	Mitch says, Captain neck beard drowned on the way in due to some quicksand.
2048720	2050720	I'd call it more like choking.
2050720	2052720	Or like a suffocation, maybe?
2052720	2057720	Yeah, like he got the earth itself inside his lungs, and then it grabbed him and wouldn't
2057720	2058720	let go.
2058720	2060720	Then yes, you are the last.
2060720	2072720	And he looks at the wife and the daughter with a certain amount of worry and extreme
2072720	2074720	joy.
2074720	2076720	Alabaster raises his hand.
2076720	2077720	Oh, yes.
2077720	2080720	I love a well mannered sea pirate.
2080720	2083720	Would you say you're the authority around these parts?
2083720	2084720	Yes, of course.
2084720	2090720	Okay, then can we have Captain Neckbeard's ship just tag along with us and help us out?
2090720	2095720	I tell you what, if you win today, you can have everyone else's ships.
2095720	2097720	Well, I was thinking more for the competition.
2097720	2098720	Yeah.
2098720	2105720	I don't want to take credit for what your island has done, but we killed them basically.
2105720	2109720	And so we are already winning the game, I think, as far as I see it.
2109720	2112720	Yeah, we had the opportunity to help and we did nothing.
2112720	2121720	In fact, we let him drown and our doctor, nevermind, we let him drown.
2121720	2122720	Don't worry about our guys.
2122720	2126720	Yeah, we thought we should have two doctors and that would be smart.
2126720	2129720	That's why we got a fellow with the funny looking glasses.
2129720	2131720	He's like on your shoulder now.
2131720	2134720	He's between me and Mitch, I imagine.
2135720	2137720	And Edward says that.
2137720	2139720	Also, that's not a neckbeard.
2139720	2141720	He just can't grow over it.
2141720	2142720	He's not part of the crew.
2142720	2143720	He just can't.
2143720	2147720	Also, Captain Neckbeard said we could have his ship and use it for the competition as
2147720	2151720	he was suffocating or choking or drowning, whatever.
2151720	2154720	You're making quite the seafarers case, Cindy.
2154720	2162720	I honestly couldn't care less as long as the stream from the bungalow is never cut.
2162720	2167720	All right, well, if we got two ships, could we get your wife as a second orator in a second
2167720	2168720	bungalow?
2168720	2169720	Yes, of course.
2169720	2174720	And the woman walks toward you as well, solemnly, almost hesitantly.
2174720	2181720	As soon as somebody like of that social stature is anywhere near Mr. Spitz, he like very comically
2181720	2184720	bows and his shitty wig falls off.
2185720	2193720	She looks at you and she says, it's time to deposit your collateral.
2193720	2197720	She points at one of the pools on the outside of this clearing.
2197720	2201720	Yeah, Lady Diggery, as you can see, our talker is sleeping one off here.
2201720	2204720	So me and your boy Mitch are going to help him over to his hole.
2204720	2208720	Any problem, you won't hear a peep out of him this whole time, I'd imagine.
2209720	2211720	Yep, she rolled a 90.
2212720	2215720	She doesn't even listen to people like of our...
2215720	2216720	Oh God, not at all.
2216720	2222720	She's already turned around and is looking deeply into her husband's eyes and saying goodbye.
2222720	2227720	I hit play on the boombox that makes the doctor dance his way over to the pool.
2228720	2236720	Mr. Spitz and Mitch Diggery walk over with the body of Dr. Shark and place him gently
2236720	2244720	into this pool and his ears are in the water, his eyes, nose and mouth are above
2244720	2255720	and this quicksand that was all gummed up the works of his head begins kind of mixing with the water.
2255720	2258720	Yes sir, do you believe it is time to begin?
2258720	2263720	The other ships are waiting, you will see the smoke will change color
2263720	2266720	and that is how you will know to begin the race.
2266720	2273720	Remember, a perfect circle, not perfect in shape so much as complete.
2273720	2277720	One end must come to the other, do you understand?
2277720	2283720	We could send the ships two different ways, we get there twice as fast.
2283720	2288720	I don't know if we can trust them, they've not got a captain.
2288720	2292720	It is a matter of who we put on that other ship to make sure that they follow our instructions.
2292720	2293720	That's true.
2293720	2301720	It does also have to be a clean circle from one bunghole, each bunghole.
2301720	2307720	I think maybe we use their ship as a defense, like a shield from the others.
2307720	2313720	But also with the second bunghole and the other one, we've got insurance in case our bunghole,
2313720	2316720	anything happens to it, go for it Mitch.
2316720	2321720	I think if anything gets fired at us though, we have that protecting us because those men
2321720	2326720	to me didn't know about them yesterday, won't know about them tomorrow.
2326720	2327720	If they die, they die.
2327720	2328720	Oh, you mean the neckbeards?
2328720	2329720	Yes, absolutely.
2329720	2330720	Not our crew.
2330720	2331720	I agree.
2331720	2335720	Not our crew that I could name every single one of them if you asked me to.
2335720	2338720	Every, all, all of them.
2338720	2340720	I know there's a certain number but...
2340720	2343720	As any of us could, name all ninety souls aboard.
2343720	2344720	I'm not great at counting.
2344720	2346720	Well it was ninety.
2346720	2350720	And listen, I don't care about the neckbeards none either, all of them smell like cum.
2351720	2354720	I heard that mate.
2354720	2356720	No offense Dr. Jimmy.
2356720	2358720	No, none taken sir.
2358720	2361720	And he looks down at his well encrusted...
2361720	2364720	They pleasure themselves most terribly.
2364720	2368720	It's awful, it's awful what they do as he covers himself.
2368720	2370720	No strumpets will come aboard.
2370720	2374720	So should we head back to the ships and depart?
2374720	2376720	I'd say so my Australian friend.
2376720	2382720	On the way back, Alabaster, he feels pretty uncomfortable with like, just having left
2382720	2388720	the dead body of his like, Dr. Shark is taking care of him like, kept him alive and so he
2388720	2394720	just watched that whole thing go down and was like, uncomfortable but he sings this
2394720	2399720	little lullaby that Dr. Shark used to sing to him.
2399720	2404720	Hmm...
2404720	2407720	Hmm...
2407720	2412720	Dr. Shark did-did-did Dr. Shark did-did-did
2412720	2414720	Dr. Shark did-did-did-did
2414720	2415720	Dr. Sh-
2459720	2463720	Early in the mornin'
2463720	2465720	Sittin' in his belly with a rusty razor
2465720	2467720	Shave his belly with a rusty razor
2467720	2469720	Shave his belly with a rusty razor
2469720	2471720	Early in the mornin'
2471720	2473720	Hey, and up she rises
2473720	2475720	Hey, and up she rises
2475720	2477720	Hey, and up she rises
2477720	2479720	Early in the mornin'
2479720	2481720	Oh, that's the end of it
2481720	2483720	That's how we do it with the junkins
2483720	2485720	Early in the mornin'
2485720	2487720	This is like a five, uh
2487720	2489720	Five paragraph essay, like
2489720	2491720	Tell them what you're gonna tell them
2491720	2493720	Tell them, tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them
2493720	2495720	Tell them, tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them
2495720	2497720	That's what we do with the drunken sailor
