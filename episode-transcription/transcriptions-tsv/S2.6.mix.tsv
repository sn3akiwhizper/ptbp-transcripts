0	3180	Hello, my ever-present fan base.
3180	6200	It's your time jumping, dimension bumping,
6200	9480	grease pumping baby wolf the dog.
9480	14080	And I'm here to slurp up all the information of the worlds
14080	17200	and regurgitate it back into all y'all's mouths
17200	19520	like the baby birds y'all are.
19520	22660	Chirp, chirp, my hungry little chickadees.
22660	27460	Mama Wolf is bringing that good slop fresh out of her gullet.
27460	28440	Oh yeah.
28440	33440	We're also live from 694.2 PTBP or something, I guess.
34440	36740	And now speaking of sustenance,
36740	40180	this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from at Bagel Boy,
40180	43840	who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod,
43840	47360	which is the third quickest way to make wolf salivate.
48360	51240	Bagel Boy writes, howdy wolf.
51240	53820	Just wanted to send some good vibes your way
53820	55960	and to tell you to stay greasy.
55960	57480	I'm new to the big city
57520	60880	and although everything right now is new and unfamiliar,
60880	65000	I'm glad I got good old wolf to grace my hearing holes.
65000	68040	The city seems nice so far.
68040	70360	Aside from the fact that I've been mugged
70360	72560	four damn times this week,
72560	75160	I haven't seen a single damn police officer
75160	76520	since I got here.
76520	79160	Though I'll admit it does make me oddly feel
79160	83360	like I'm right back home in sleepy, quiet contention.
83360	85960	Anywho, keep up the good work over there
85960	88600	and I'll keep on tuning in over here.
88600	92360	Oh, and stay safe out here in the concrete jungle.
92360	94680	I wouldn't want to see my good friend wolf
94680	96760	on the evening news.
96760	100240	Thanks for writing into the show, boy of bagels.
100240	102960	I'm glad we got some listeners buzzing in
102960	105840	from old sleepy and quiet contention.
105840	108480	Never anything exciting or dimension altering
108480	110040	ever happened over there.
110040	111880	No sir, redo.
111880	115260	Nothing to see over there, that's for dang sure.
116280	117200	Ha, ha, ha.
121040	123920	If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl,
123920	127120	tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram,
127120	129720	tag pretending to be people on Facebook,
129720	131360	or write up a five star review
131360	133580	on the podcast app of your choice.
133580	136000	Screenshot that stunning missive
136000	138720	and get it in front of old wolfy's eye holes
138720	142100	so I can say, hey, thanks.
142100	143880	Now raise your hands in the air
143880	146760	if you support this show on Patreon.
146760	149400	Wave them around, get weird with it.
149400	153920	Fuck everybody else because you, my delicious listener,
153920	158000	are keeping the proverbial lights metaphorically on
158000	161240	in this quote unquote studio.
161240	165640	In the ephemeral words of Dame Alyssa Arnett Elliott,
165640	167440	get your freak on.
167440	169840	In the words of Cal Colorado,
169840	173320	blah, blah, whatever, something about the news.
173320	177020	Last time, the field team for the City Action News
177020	182000	began in a familiar place, the CAN Conference Room.
182000	185200	But without Ty Frailand at the head of the table,
185200	188280	lead anchor Isabel Acaya took on the role
188280	192920	of handing out assignments and sent Cal Colorado and co
192920	197120	off on a wild goose chase to a mysterious drop pen
197120	200120	for exclusive coverage of a secret town
200120	202560	run by the Godel Company.
202640	206440	They were joined by Stevie, a production assistant
206440	209880	with a wall of dark wavy hair that covered all of her face
209880	211880	except a pierced bottom lip.
211880	215840	And the four members of City Action News drove and drove
215840	218040	further and further off the grid.
218040	220840	All the road signs told them to turn back,
220840	223560	but they carried on until the CAN van
223560	226240	approached a perspective engulfing wall
226240	228780	made of tree-lined vines and kudzu,
228820	233060	taking us now to the other side of this foresty facade,
233060	237420	this biennial barrier, the dam of detritus.
237420	242420	It's Altagirl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.
242700	245700	It's all my fault
245700	250700	Cause my life is great
250700	252700	And it's all mine
259780	264780	Cause my life is great
264780	267780	And it's all my fault
277780	279780	Were you at his house that said that?
279780	281780	I didn't say it was disgusting, but I was like
281780	282780	Well, you meant it
282780	283780	You are
283780	284780	I don't think it's disgusting.
284780	288780	I think it's thoroughly emasculating
291780	293780	Do you feel emasculating when I burp you?
293780	295780	To be burped like a baby
295780	297780	Well, so I don't think about being emasculating
297780	300780	because I don't think in terms like that, you know?
300780	303780	I don't feel like a father when I do it, if that helps
303780	305780	When I think of myself, I don't really think of myself
305780	309780	Yeah, you're more like a sexually dominant, like
309780	310780	Always
310780	313780	I don't really ever think of myself as a man
314780	317780	I'm like a boy that has to shave
317780	319780	I don't have a beard
319780	320780	Do you have to shave?
320780	322780	I thought you were saying, I don't have to
322780	325780	No, I don't have a beard, but I have to shave
327780	329780	Dude, literally, I shaved this morning
329780	333780	Yesterday at Ethan's house, Jake Herron was over there
333780	334780	and he's like
334780	336780	Shout out to Jake's Vegan Burgers
336780	337780	Are we recording?
337780	338780	I had the taco meat tonight
338780	339780	Oh, nice
339780	340780	Jake was on season one of the podcast
340780	342780	and on our Patreon
342780	344780	I hung out with Jake last night
344780	347780	Go listen to the, we were fighting the devil in Hawaii
347780	348780	or something
348780	350780	Yeah, a church group fighting the devil in Hawaii
350780	354780	He was like, dude, Luke, I've never seen you with facial hair
354780	357780	and I'm like, yeah, it's a mistake
357780	359780	I don't have facial hair
359780	362780	and this is something that I don't know that I've brought up
362780	365780	with you guys before, but I follow a Reddit
365780	368780	about what I have and they say, tell your friends
368780	371780	Have you ever noticed me picking at my face?
371780	372780	No
372780	377780	I have trichotillomania, which I pull my hair out
377780	380780	and it's like, I enjoy doing that
380780	382780	but it's like, you shouldn't do that
382780	383780	Specifically your face?
383780	386780	I should probably stop pulling hair out of your face, too
386780	388780	Wait, but the subreddit says that you should
388780	391780	tell all your friends
391780	393780	It's a callback from the last episode
393780	395780	It is, that's not make damn sure, is it?
395780	397780	No, I mean, it's by taking it
397780	399780	I know it's taking back Sunday, I just don't know
399780	402780	Anyway, some people it's like on their head
402780	404780	Some people it's like random parts of the body
404780	408780	So when I grow my facial hair out, it's only here and here
408780	412780	and it's because I literally just pick all the hair out of my cheeks
412780	415780	and I'm trying really hard to stop it
415780	417780	So if you see me doing that, tell me not to
417780	419780	So is it like a support group on Reddit kind of thing?
419780	423780	Yeah, it's like a join this so that you can think about doing it
423780	424780	so you stop doing it
424780	425780	Interesting
425780	426780	Should we get a spray bottle?
426780	428780	Yeah, just spray me when I do it
428780	434780	Literally, I can grow hair on my cheeks
434780	436780	Also, if you look at my middle fingernail
436780	437780	Did you just do it?
437780	438780	It's literally like
438780	440780	Luke, don't
440780	444780	It's like worn down because I pick like that
444780	449780	My thumb and middle fingernails have like indents
449780	454780	Is there a support group for grown adults who need to be burped like babies on Reddit?
454780	458780	See, that's a thing that I don't want to give up
458780	460780	And hey, here's the thing
460780	464780	And I'm not far enough, it's not a fetish yet
464780	466780	Luke, you let me know when it is
466780	467780	Yeah
467780	468780	But
468780	469780	Dude
469780	471780	I don't know, hopefully this isn't recorded
471780	472780	Or maybe it is
472780	474780	Maybe it is and you're out there and you have trichotillomania
474780	476780	It is recorded, is that okay?
476780	480780	That's fine because literally I would love to grow a beard
480780	487780	And the only thing stopping me from doing that is me picking the hairs out of my face
487780	489780	Just so you guys know
489780	491780	Spray me, baby
491780	497780	If we hit a certain Patreon goal, we're gonna get Luke a Hannibal Lecter mask
497780	498780	So he can't touch his face
498780	503780	I think it'd be more to just like glue oven mitts on my hands for a while
503780	504780	So I can't do it
504780	505780	Glue them
505780	506780	Glue them on me
506780	507780	Why not both?
507780	509780	Fuck day
509780	512780	Glue oven mitts to my face like a Hannibal Lecter
515780	518780	And then all your hair gets ripped out when we take it off
519780	520780	Solved
520780	522780	Look how long his beard was
525780	529780	And then I was gonna make like a ripping your pubes joke out but that's a real thing
529780	531780	Yeah, ouchie, ouchie
531780	532780	Ouchie, ouchie
532780	533780	So
533780	536780	We saw some cool shit at the end of the last episode
536780	538780	It was like fucking cool, dude
540780	546780	What do you remember? What is the vision in your mind of what you saw at the end of the last episode?
546780	553780	Crazy ravine where no ravine should be behind a crazy wall where no wall should be
554780	561780	With a train where no train should be leading over a gigantic fucking bridge where no bridge should be
561780	562780	Well said
562780	571780	During our break I was just like googling Blaine the Mono which is like the scary train from the Dark Tower series
571780	572780	Okay
572780	576780	I've got three opened up here, scroll through them, but that's what I was imagining
576780	579780	Oh, duh, these look like evil trains, dudes
579780	581780	Yeah, straight up evil trains, bro
581780	583780	Train one had kind of tentacles or something underneath it
583780	584780	Well
584780	585780	No tentacles on this one
585780	591780	I didn't think there were but it seems Cthulhu-y to have tentacles
591780	592780	Cthulhu-onian
592780	593780	But also
593780	594780	Cthulhu-onian
594780	601780	If you guys haven't listened to, I say listened to the Dark Tower series because I read the first book and the last book
601780	603780	And I listened to all the rest of them
603780	607780	Listen to the Dark Tower series, it's really good
607780	609780	If you like Delta Green, holy shit, bro
609780	612780	If you like Delta Green, don't fucking listen to the Dark Tower
612780	614780	Listen to Pretending to Be People
614780	615780	Season one
615780	618780	Scary, very scary
618780	625780	Also, his name is Blaine the Mono because Blaine the Train I guess is too stupid
628780	630780	It all seems pretty stupid
632780	635780	I don't know, you do a bunch of coke and write a whole series
635780	636780	Okay
636780	638780	Challenge accepted, yeah
638780	643780	No, like the little faces on the train are so dumb
643780	645780	Like the mean eyes
645780	647780	None of those are like
647780	650780	I'm Blaine the Mono, don't call me Blaine the Train
650780	651780	I'm evil
651780	653780	That's why I'm angry
653780	657780	Everybody keeps calling me Blaine the Train
657780	661780	Um, the train I guess isn't sentient though
661780	664780	No, it's pretty simple looking
664780	665780	Aw, damn
665780	667780	Oh, I thought you meant Blaine
667780	669780	Oh, Blaine is sentient for sure, bro
669780	672780	He's definitely sentient
673780	680780	I wanted to clarify, is this bridge that is extending outward from us across the ravine, first of all?
680780	681780	Yes
681780	684780	And you said 100 meters long, does that mean we can see the other side?
684780	685780	Yes
685780	686780	Okay, what's on the other side?
686780	688780	The same thing that's on your side
688780	689780	Which is?
689780	690780	A train station and a wall
690780	692780	A train station and a wall
692780	693780	And a wall
693780	694780	Fuck that
695780	696780	That's creepy
696780	699780	And so the fog is all settled in the ravine below us
699780	701780	You said a deep foggy ravine
701780	703780	Yep, the fog is settled in the ravine below you
703780	704780	Cool
704780	710780	I need everyone to roll grip, as this is a deeply unnatural sight
711780	714780	I pass a 20 out of 75
714780	716780	If you fail, you're just going to lose one grip
716780	721780	I was going to say, I pass enough that I don't even have to look up what mine is
721780	722780	3
722780	723780	Rolled a 3
723780	725780	I rolled an 87, which is a failure
725780	726780	Which is a failure
726780	733780	So you're going to lose one grip, and with that, as you guys are looking around this area, Cal is...
733780	740780	You don't know this about me, or maybe you do, but I happen to be an avid student of local geography
740780	742780	And this ravine should not be here
742780	744780	This ravine can't be here
744780	747780	Well, I mean, we're looking right at it, dude, it's right there
747780	750780	I know it's here, but it shouldn't be
750780	752780	Are you getting this? Are you getting shots of this?
752780	753780	Beck definitely is
753780	760780	We're 87 minutes away from my home, and there could be one, I don't know
760780	766780	This ravine would be a national park, if it was natural
766780	770780	Does it look natural, or is it smooth walled or something weird?
770780	777780	Go ahead and roll if you have any sort of science, or I'll take intelligence at a negative 20
777780	779780	Any of us, or him?
779780	780780	Any of you
781780	786780	Oh my god, at a negative 20, that makes my intelligence 50?
786780	787780	I got a 51
790780	792780	Oh, I can roll on intelligence?
792780	793780	Mine is 20, yeah
793780	796780	Oh, I pass with flying freaking colors, bro
796780	799780	At a negative 20, I'm also a 50, and I rolled a 50
799780	803780	Nice, we got a success there, and we got a success from Julius Summers
803780	806780	Julius Summers is the only one who really notices
806780	809780	And I only say that because Cal Colorado is dealing with
810780	821780	Yeah, loss of grip, and on top of the loss of grip, just the itchiest face, hands, and arms that he's felt since he was a boy
821780	822780	Not to touch my face
822780	824780	Oh, you fell face forward, sir
824780	825780	Critical fail
825780	827780	I didn't realize that Cal's money maker was
827780	830780	Oh, it's gonna be a time frame situation at this point
830780	836780	With the crit fail, I think all your clothes came off real quick, you rolled around in it, and then they all flew back on
836780	837780	Yeah
837780	841780	Yeah, no, you are working on a time crunch to your face not being camera ready
841780	844780	Stevie, do you have any concealer? Do you have any
844780	848780	Yeah, and she's right on it, and she's getting into her makeup bag and coming at your face
848780	852780	Stevie, you're practically a Marvin, you don't know what that means, but
852780	857780	Julius feels deeply insulted by that comment
857780	864780	Julius is far too busy staring at the deeply unnatural sides of this rock
864780	874780	You can't quite put your finger on it, but it's nothing that you've ever seen before, this is not a natural occurrence, I need you to roll grip
874780	875780	Haha
875780	879780	And yeah, I like what Joe said earlier, let's say it's really smooth
879780	880780	Yeah
880780	881780	Cool, I like that
881780	884780	I'm unaffected with a five
884780	891780	Amazing, so you know that this is not normal, it may not have ever happened before, but
891780	894780	No, not but, but so
894780	896780	It's a kick ass
896780	908780	Julius pulls his phone out, goes to TikTok, thinks it's the perfect time for the calzone
908780	911780	Cal, could you stand next
911780	914780	It's much better Mr. Colorado now, it's much better
914780	921780	Julius points his phone at Cal and looks at his phone to see like how good he looks on his screen
921780	922780	Sure
922780	923780	Does it look good
923780	924780	Yes
924780	925780	Is he made up
925780	926780	Yeah and honestly it's
926780	927780	Maybe you slide over to a filter
927780	929780	Oh for sure, yeah
929780	937780	Well one of the things that Julius did on the way here was, because he didn't have to drive, was make a can filter
937780	940780	Specifically made for Cal, Colorado
940780	941780	A calcan?
941780	945780	The calcan, the calcam for the calzone
945780	947780	The calcam for the calzone
947780	949780	The calcam for the calzone
949780	953780	And it perfectly matches his skin tone or something
953780	958780	No, it's just like any blemishes or anything are kind of like smoothed over a little bit
958780	970780	Okay so you need to get this poison oak faced, elderly, older statesman of anchors to dance like a monkey for your TikTok
970780	972780	While he's just lost grip
972780	975780	We are not dancing for this calzone
975780	978780	Look at where we are, this is insane dude
978780	980780	I'm saying this to the DM
985780	986780	Cal
986780	987780	Julius
987780	990780	Get next to the edge and we're gonna do a calzone
990780	992780	You want me to go on right now?
992780	993780	You want me to be on?
993780	996780	Well you don't have to be on, we can practice it, it's a TikTok
996780	999780	You can practice a TikTok?
999780	1001780	We don't even have to record the first time
1001780	1006780	I've spent 30 years on air living on the razor jads of live TV
1006780	1008780	Have you ever thought about acting?
1008780	1010780	I'm mostly thinking about itching
1010780	1013780	Well they're from what I've heard one and the same
1013780	1015780	I'll make a note of that
1015780	1018780	Right now I'm acting very hard
1021780	1024780	Well then let's not make you act too hard
1024780	1030780	And he just starts recording just video that way he can upload it to TikTok later
1030780	1034780	I'm here in front of an unholy monstrosity
1034780	1039780	The god old corporation in their avarice has torn a trench into mother earth
1039780	1040780	Make it fun
1045780	1047780	It's very deep and broad
1047780	1049780	Like the dance that you're gonna do
1050780	1053780	Cal just looks at the camera and like bewilderment and confusion
1054780	1057780	Who could dance at a moment like this?
1057780	1058780	Not this reporter
1058780	1061780	Julius cuts it off right after like not this reporter
1061780	1064780	And he's like okay, perfect, I got this
1064780	1069780	And then he just starts editing the can talk together
1069780	1074780	Hey man, we have like TikTok quotas or whatever
1074780	1076780	But like maybe we wait to post that
1076780	1079780	My uncle told me to do TikToks
1080780	1082780	Yeah, for sure
1082780	1087780	I just don't know if like we like we're kind of in the middle of like figuring out what this is
1087780	1091780	Like what if it's like, you know a nuclear test site
1091780	1093780	We don't want people like rushing out here to see it
1093780	1095780	Understandable
1096780	1099780	He continues editing the TikTok
1101780	1103780	Cool man, I'm glad you heard me
1103780	1108780	Beck, anytime you want to talk to me, I'm here to listen
1108780	1110780	That means a lot dude, thanks
1110780	1113780	Yeah, and then he finishes editing the TikTok
1113780	1116780	And he doesn't post it, but he sends it to his uncle
1116780	1118780	Interesting
1118780	1124780	So looking at this simple train car in this simple train station
1124780	1126780	All seemingly made out of steel
1126780	1129780	All built for this one single car
1129780	1135780	You see that there are lockers adjacent on the exterior wall of the station
1135780	1140780	And above it the sign of course says, welcome to Grover's Gorge
1140780	1146780	Founded by Frank Godel in 1945 by necessity not choice
1147780	1152780	I know it was founded by Frank Godel, but what if it was founded by Grover from Sesame Street
1152780	1155780	Let's just all take a moment to imagine that
1155780	1157780	I actually saw that What If episode
1159780	1161780	Is What If a show?
1161780	1163780	Are you thinking of What Would You Do?
1164780	1166780	What If with John Quiñones
1166780	1168780	With John Quiñones
1169780	1171780	What?
1171780	1173780	What Would You Do with John Quiñones?
1173780	1175780	John Quiñones
1175780	1177780	Yeah, Quiñones
1177780	1178780	Quiñones
1178780	1180780	You've never seen What Would You Do?
1180780	1182780	The whole premise of the show is like
1182780	1186780	We get actors to do really shitty things in public
1186780	1189780	And then we see what the public does
1189780	1191780	What Would You Do?
1191780	1194780	What would you do if a guy beat up a little kid?
1194780	1196780	What would you do if he was at home
1196780	1198780	Sixteen seasons
1198780	1200780	February 26, 2008, the present
1200780	1202780	I've never even heard of this show
1202780	1204780	The thing that kills me, Thomas, is that you're not alone in that
1204780	1206780	There's a lot of people who haven't seen it
1206780	1207780	But for some reason
1207780	1208780	I've seen like every episode
1208780	1210780	Everybody on the show that ends up being on the show
1210780	1213780	They go, oh my god, it's John Quiñones
1213780	1216780	As if they all know him and he's a big celebrity
1217780	1219780	It was created by Chris Whipple
1219780	1220780	Which is a very fun name
1220780	1221780	That is a very fun name
1221780	1222780	Chris Whipple
1222780	1224780	Not a fun show, really, though
1224780	1225780	Zach, I don't want to harp on this ravine
1225780	1227780	But I just realized we didn't ask what was down left or right
1227780	1230780	Like, how far can we see? How far does this ravine go?
1230780	1233780	So you can actually even really see how deep the ravine is
1233780	1235780	Or how far left or right it is
1235780	1237780	Because it's so foggy
1237780	1239780	You can see to the other side
1239780	1241780	That a hundred meters across
1241780	1244780	But the fog is just filling up this ravine
1245780	1247780	And then the fog kind of
1247780	1252780	Takes over the land far down on the left and far down on the right
1252780	1255780	So you can't even see the end of these walls
1255780	1257780	Of massive plant life
1257780	1260780	If there were another bridge like the one we're looking at
1260780	1261780	Would you be able to see it?
1261780	1262780	If there was one
1262780	1264780	You would be able to see it
1264780	1267780	If it was within about a hundred meters of you on either side
1267780	1269780	Okay, and we don't see anything
1269780	1273780	Beck, could I borrow a mic clip?
1273780	1275780	Sure, of course, dude
1275780	1278780	Hey, Stevie, would you grab a mic clip out of there?
1278780	1279780	Yeah, of course, yeah
1279780	1280780	Here you go, sir
1280780	1282780	Julius grabs the mic clip
1282780	1285780	And he shows it to Beck
1285780	1288780	He's like, can you get audio from this?
1288780	1290780	Yeah, oh yeah, for sure
1290780	1291780	Hang on a second
1291780	1293780	He wires it up to the receiver
1293780	1296780	Could you do it unwired?
1296780	1297780	Do what unwired?
1297780	1300780	Bluetooth, perhaps?
1300780	1302780	What are you getting at, man?
1302780	1303780	I'm gonna throw it
1303780	1305780	Oh no, we can't afford to lose a whole mic, dude
1305780	1309780	This is your first serious error as a producer
1309780	1312780	The network will not be pleased to hear about how you wanted to use their equipment
1312780	1315780	And unfortunately, Beck and I are duty bound to report it
1315780	1317780	I will say Beck did
1317780	1321780	Beck did say we have so many of those
1321780	1323780	Yeah, it's for like, you know, miking up people
1323780	1326780	But like, we're not gonna like toss them over ravines
1326780	1329780	Sometimes you have to interview a group of school children
1329780	1330780	Or perhaps a church choir
1330780	1333780	Can I roll to see if this is Bluetooth or wired?
1333780	1335780	It's wired for sure
1335780	1337780	Wired for sound
1337780	1341780	So yeah, Julius throws the mic with the mic clip over the side
1341780	1344780	But then it just like six feet later stops
1344780	1346780	Cause it's wired in
1346780	1348780	What can you hear, Julius?
1348780	1350780	Not what I want to do
1350780	1354780	And Stevie's walking up and noticing your headphones
1354780	1357780	Beck and she's like, Mr. Wilder, those are some sweet cans
1358780	1359780	Dude, thanks!
1359780	1360780	And I knuckle, Stevie
1360780	1361780	Knuckle
1361780	1364780	Cal Colorado gets like a chill down his spine
1364780	1367780	As if he's heard that voice from someone else in a past life
1369780	1371780	Another faithful
1371780	1373780	That was smart, I am smart
1375780	1378780	Hey, Julius, like if you're trying to like get a sense of like the depth here
1378780	1380780	We could just do the old fashion way
1380780	1381780	And Beck finds a rock
1381780	1383780	Dosses it over the edge to listen for the sound
1383780	1385780	And you listen
1385780	1387780	And you listen
1387780	1389780	And you listen
1390780	1393780	As if you threw a rock off of a cliff
1393780	1396780	9.82 meters per second squared, right?
1396780	1397780	Uh huh
1397780	1399780	You're asking the right people
1399780	1403780	Down about somewhere like 836 feet
1403780	1406780	Like basically 80 stories
1406780	1408780	And then you hear just
1408780	1411780	Of a rock hitting water
1411780	1413780	It sounds like it's about 80 stories down
1413780	1415780	Uh, there's water down there
1416780	1418780	I don't even think we'd be able to hear that
1419780	1421780	No, but once I started talking
1421780	1423780	I was like, well, fuck
1423780	1424780	No, I heard it
1424780	1425780	Cause the mic
1425780	1426780	I know I heard it
1426780	1427780	The mic's hanging over the edge there
1427780	1428780	And I picked it up on my headphones
1428780	1430780	Good work, Julius
1433780	1435780	On this simple single train car
1435780	1437780	You see two steel doors
1437780	1438780	One toward the rear
1438780	1440780	One toward the front
1440780	1442780	And they both slide open
1442780	1444780	Without obstructing the large lettering
1444780	1447780	Laid out under the train car's windows
1447780	1449780	It says
1452780	1454780	My uncle didn't tell me
1454780	1456780	That this is what we would be looking at
1456780	1459780	But I think if we go in
1459780	1462780	I can impress my uncle
1462780	1463780	If I recall correctly
1463780	1465780	Your uncle didn't tell you anything
1465780	1467780	You haven't been in contact with him
1467780	1468780	Julius goes in
1468780	1470780	And acts like he doesn't hear this
1470780	1472780	Given that assignment by
1472780	1474780	Julius walks right into the train
1474780	1475780	The woman who took my job
1475780	1477780	And actively
1477780	1479780	Actively doesn't hear this
1479780	1481780	Looking out over the bridge
1481780	1483780	Is it also enveloped in fog
1483780	1485780	Or can we see, like, the center clearly
1485780	1487780	You can see the center of the bridge clearly
1487780	1489780	Is there anything distinguishing, like
1489780	1491780	This is a Thomas question, not a Cal question
1491780	1492780	Okay
1492780	1493780	This is a Zach answer
1493780	1496780	Does it look like a train is blinking out of existence
1496780	1497780	In the middle of the bridge or something
1497780	1499780	Like there's evidence of, like, cartoonish
1499780	1500780	Burn patterns or something
1500780	1502780	If Thomas is asking no
1502780	1503780	Cal's looking at the center of the bridge
1503780	1505780	It doesn't look like anything weird
1505780	1507780	Is gonna happen in the middle
1509780	1510780	I think if we get in this train
1510780	1512780	We'll just pass uneventfully
1512780	1513780	To the other station
1513780	1515780	Perhaps that's where this gate is
1515780	1517780	Julius walks into the train
1517780	1519780	And finds the snack cart
1519780	1521780	Stevie's, uh
1521780	1522780	Gathering up all the equipment
1522780	1524780	And dragging it up into the back
1524780	1526780	And the seating in this train car
1526780	1528780	Is similar to the types of train cars
1528780	1530780	That have a narrow aisle
1530780	1532780	Running down the middle of the car
1532780	1534780	With two seats on either side
1534780	1535780	Oh you mean
1535780	1537780	All trains
1537780	1539780	So with five rows
1539780	1541780	There's enough space here
1541780	1542780	For
1547780	1548780	Magic
1548780	1549780	20 passengers
1549780	1550780	Oh
1551780	1552780	Sitting
1552780	1553780	20 sitting passengers
1553780	1555780	Magical schooler
1555780	1556780	There are some cabinets
1556780	1558780	In which Julius finds
1558780	1560780	Some light refreshments
1560780	1561780	Energy drink
1561780	1562780	Energy drink
1562780	1563780	And pretzels
1563780	1565780	I like to think that energy drink
1565780	1567780	Is made by the Godel Corporation
1567780	1569780	Is just a plain, like, aluminum
1569780	1571780	Unpainted can with energy drink
1571780	1573780	Painted in the same green
1573780	1574780	That, like, the
1574780	1576780	That was on the wall outside
1576780	1577780	It's perfect
1577780	1579780	And yeah, you find some energy drinks
1579780	1580780	There
1580780	1582780	And there are large windows
1582780	1584780	On either side of this steel train car
1584780	1586780	Which kind of looks like a giant can of energy drink
1586780	1588780	Which does
1588780	1590780	And the lettering is green
1590780	1591780	So it matches
1591780	1592780	Is this the can tram?
1592780	1593780	This is the can tram
1593780	1594780	Fuck yeah
1594780	1596780	Cal steps on and says
1596780	1597780	Now it's the cal tram
1597780	1599780	And there's TV screens
1599780	1601780	Mounted in both the front and the rear
1601780	1603780	The modern flat screens
1603780	1605780	Flicker to life
1605780	1606780	As you all enter
1606780	1607780	And you see a blank
1607780	1609780	White sound stage
1609780	1610780	With a white stool
1610780	1611780	On the screens
1611780	1613780	Oh if your stool is white
1613780	1615780	You should probably get that checked out
1615780	1616780	Yeah, definitely
1616780	1617780	Like some like
1617780	1619780	Sun dried dog poop
1619780	1620780	Yeah, that's
1620780	1621780	That is not natural
1621780	1622780	You don't see much of that
1622780	1623780	You said stool
1623780	1624780	So we thought
1624780	1625780	Poop, white poop
1625780	1627780	A man walks into frame
1627780	1628780	Sits on the stool
1628780	1629780	Oh no
1629780	1631780	Stool, you said it again
1633780	1634780	And smiles
1634780	1635780	Joe, when he says stool
1635780	1637780	What do you think of?
1639780	1641780	No, I think of a seat with four legs
1641780	1642780	What are you guys?
1642780	1645780	Oh, I think a big poopy
1645780	1646780	Actually, stool
1646780	1647780	It's medical
1647780	1649780	I think of a very gross poopy
1649780	1651780	When we start calling it stool
1651780	1653780	There's a reason it's been collected
1653780	1654780	And it can't be good
1654780	1656780	A man walks into the frame
1656780	1658780	Sits on the stool
1658780	1661780	And smiles at the viewer
1661780	1662780	Well hello there
1662780	1664780	Cal says hello
1664780	1666780	I'm Fred Godel
1666780	1667780	And you see the Fred Godel
1667780	1669780	He's a soft looking man
1669780	1670780	In his later 60s
1670780	1672780	With a loose plumpness
1672780	1673780	And glasses
1673780	1675780	That consistently look like
1675780	1677780	They're about to fall off of his nose
1677780	1679780	With black pants and shoes
1679780	1680780	Fred's green shirt
1680780	1683780	Is the only pop of color in the shot
1683780	1685780	Welcome to Godel's Gate
1685780	1687780	To Grover's Gorge
1687780	1689780	I'm overjoyed that you're here to join me
1689780	1691780	On a tour of the future
1691780	1693780	Before we begin
1693780	1696780	Please leave all outside food and beverages
1696780	1698780	In the complimentary lockers
1698780	1700780	On the outside of this here
1700780	1703780	Simple steel single train car sized train station
1703780	1706780	Fred Godel points his finger into the air
1706780	1708780	And a purple light comes on
1708780	1711780	This one means there's still
1711780	1714780	Outside food or beverages in the car
1714780	1716780	He moves his hand a bit over
1716780	1718780	And a green light comes on
1718780	1720780	This one means you're good to go
1720780	1723780	So which light stays on?
1723780	1724780	Definitely the purple
1724780	1726780	With Stevie's huge bag of awesome snacks
1726780	1727780	Yeah
1727780	1730780	And Stevie kind of looks at the screen
1730780	1732780	With this like anger
1732780	1734780	As she goes down to the bag
1734780	1736780	And is like ugh
1736780	1738780	Guys I think I got to get rid of all these snacks
1738780	1740780	I'm sorry the cooler
1740780	1742780	But did you finish the coke in that energy drink
1742780	1743780	That I brought you?
1743780	1744780	Yeah but hang on a sec
1744780	1746780	And Beck is getting into her bag
1746780	1747780	And finding energy drinks
1747780	1749780	And is chugging
1749780	1751780	Like at least one if you guys want to get in on this
1751780	1752780	Julius does not
1752780	1754780	I've got a thought
1754780	1756780	Maybe leave one of those for last
1756780	1758780	And see if the light stays purple
1758780	1760780	Yeah of course Cal
1760780	1762780	Let me just get
1762780	1764780	Topped up here real quick
1764780	1765780	Hang on
1765780	1767780	Do you need to be burped?
1767780	1769780	While this is happening
1769780	1771780	Julius is going to wander up there
1771780	1773780	And see if he can't just like
1773780	1775780	Turn the light off or something
1775780	1777780	Yeah it's just kind of these like
1777780	1779780	Colored bulbs over the top
1779780	1781780	Of where the light is
1781780	1783780	And just the bulb on the outside
1783780	1785780	Is the coloration that's making it
1785780	1787780	So Julius's hand
1787780	1789780	Over the light doesn't
1789780	1791780	As Julius puts his hand
1791780	1793780	Over the purple light
1793780	1795780	His hand kind of turns
1795780	1796780	Purplish
1796780	1797780	Right like
1797780	1798780	I'm not saying that it's going to change
1798780	1800780	I'm saying like just if it's covered up
1800780	1801780	Like
1801780	1803780	There's nobody else on the train right?
1803780	1805780	They're not going to know
1805780	1807780	But the train knows Julius
1809780	1810780	Exactly
1810780	1811780	Julius
1811780	1813780	Continues to hold his hand over the light
1813780	1814780	Just to see
1814780	1815780	It's not doing anything
1815780	1816780	Still doesn't
1816780	1818780	I let Stevie go ahead and finish
1818780	1820780	Putting the bag outside the train car
1820780	1821780	Whatever she was doing
1821780	1822780	I've gotten my fill
1822780	1823780	And we are keeping one
1823780	1825780	Energy drink with us to see
1825780	1826780	Okay so
1826780	1828780	I got rid of all of the snacks and drinks
1828780	1830780	That we brought except for
1830780	1832780	And she flicks a finger
1832780	1833780	At the one in Beck's hand
1833780	1835780	And then we look to the light
1835780	1837780	And the light is still purple
1837780	1839780	We actually got rid of
1839780	1841780	All the drinks
1841780	1842780	And then he
1842780	1844780	And then he looks at the light
1847780	1850780	Are you trying to fool the light with a lie?
1850780	1852780	Julius looks at you and goes
1852780	1853780	No
1853780	1855780	As he nods his head up and down
1859780	1861780	I don't know what kind of detection system
1861780	1863780	They have for this outside food or drink
1863780	1866780	But I don't think it's based on your word
1867780	1871780	Have you ever been in an autonomous train
1871780	1874780	That knows whether you have a drink or not?
1874780	1876780	No but I've been on a roller coaster
1876780	1877780	And they just ask you there
1877780	1880780	But this light seems more insistent
1880780	1882780	Exactly
1882780	1883780	Now that you mentioned it Cal
1883780	1885780	How do they know though?
1885780	1886780	Like
1886780	1888780	And then Beck wants to see if there's a camera
1888780	1890780	Or anything in here that he can spot
1890780	1893780	Every single part of this wall is cameras and sensors
1894780	1896780	Yeah go ahead and roll search
1896780	1898780	Or you can roll computer science
1899780	1901780	I got a 48
1901780	1903780	Which is good for my computer science
1903780	1905780	So you know where to look
1905780	1907780	Which is behind this kind of like
1907780	1909780	Black sheen plastic
1909780	1910780	The top middle
1910780	1912780	The front of this train cabin
1912780	1913780	Above the TV
1913780	1914780	Sheen
1914780	1915780	Very ethical corporation
1915780	1919780	And you see if you walk real close up to it
1919780	1921780	You see that there's a
1921780	1923780	A red blinking light on it
1923780	1925780	Did anyone else succeed?
1925780	1926780	I did succeed at search
1926780	1927780	Bro
1928780	1929780	Yeah so the two of you noticed
1929780	1931780	That there are sensors of some sort
1931780	1933780	On the doors
1933780	1934780	And the entrances
1934780	1936780	On the front and back
1936780	1938780	Entrances of this train car
1938780	1939780	What do you see there Beck?
1939780	1940780	Yeah I guess like
1940780	1941780	Smile dudes
1941780	1942780	We're on candid camera
1942780	1944780	And I'm no tech wizard like you
1944780	1946780	But it appears to be
1946780	1948780	There are some sensors on this door
1948780	1949780	Food sensors
1949780	1950780	Cal
1950780	1952780	Dude
1952780	1953780	Good work
1953780	1954780	You're right man
1954780	1955780	Those are sensors
1955780	1958780	You're getting the hang of this tech stuff my man
1958780	1959780	Cal is like
1959780	1961780	Openly blushing a little bit behind the makeup
1961780	1963780	It might just be the flush of like a
1963780	1964780	Poison oaked face
1964780	1968780	But he really like
1968780	1969780	Nothing gets his old heart
1969780	1971780	Glatter than a young person saying
1971780	1974780	He did something right with technology
1974780	1977780	Julius takes his hands off the light
1977780	1979780	And he walks up to Beck
1979780	1983780	And Beck I think
1983780	1984780	If you want that
1984780	1985780	You better drink it
1985780	1987780	Dude waste not want not
1990780	1991780	Wow he drank that really fast
1991780	1993780	Beck is wired
1993780	1997780	That was the sound of Joe actually drinking an energy drink
1997780	2000780	Did Beck have his camera recording already?
2000780	2001780	Oh yeah
2001780	2002780	Oh yeah
2002780	2003780	It hasn't stopped
2003780	2005780	After his third energy drink in three minutes
2005780	2006780	He's a little wired and just like
2006780	2009780	Pointed his camera right at the camera
2009780	2010780	I see you
2010780	2013780	The watcher sees the watchman man
2014780	2015780	So
2015780	2017780	You can play that game
2017780	2018780	Train go
2018780	2021780	Well so we've now downed the can
2021780	2022780	And I guess I'll throw the can out the door
2022780	2025780	As soon as the can flies out the door
2025780	2026780	I say train go
2026780	2029780	Zach asks you all a question
2029780	2033780	In the same way that you guys ask me these kinds of questions
2033780	2037780	Did you try to sneak any additional food or bev?
2037780	2038780	We're not going to pull out like
2038780	2040780	Oh by the way I still
2040780	2044780	Actually I had peanuts in your pocket and your light's fucking dumb
2044780	2045780	Idiot
2046780	2047780	You didn't
2047780	2050780	I didn't say Simon said didn't have any food
2050780	2053780	So Simon says the light turns green
2053780	2055780	The door shuts
2055780	2057780	Hey guys I do have like six hamburgers in my pocket
2057780	2060780	Oh yeah I've got a bunch of wet lasagna
2060780	2063780	Just leaking down from my hand pockets
2063780	2065780	Dude I have to pee and poop
2065780	2069780	As the simple steel train car begins making its way down the track
2069780	2072780	It does so at a quick clip
2072780	2079780	The flat screens show an animation that follows along with a serious voiceover
2079780	2082780	In 1945
2082780	2087780	The world defeated men with evil in their hearts
2087780	2089780	Later that year
2089780	2093780	Evil itself was extinguished
2093780	2095780	Out of the windows
2096780	2100780	You see a palm sweat inducing drop
2100780	2103780	As the velocity of this train
2103780	2107780	Has whipped up enough of this fog
2107780	2110780	That it's moving up out of the ravine
2110780	2112780	And towards the clouds
2112780	2116780	And you can see deep 836 feet down
2116780	2119780	Almost 80 stories which would make this
2119780	2123780	The 21st tallest bridge in the world
2123780	2127780	The only thing that kept Frank Godel fighting those years
2127780	2130780	Was the thought of coming back home
2130780	2132780	And marrying his sweetheart
2132780	2137780	But Frank, freshly back from stamping out evil overseas
2137780	2141780	Returned only to find evil at his doorstep
2141780	2143780	Threatening his future
2143780	2146780	Looking back at the cliffside you just stood at
2146780	2152780	You can all see just how smooth and strange this wall face is
2152780	2155780	Like nothing you've ever seen before
2155780	2158780	The fight between Frank Godel and this evil
2158780	2163780	Lasted for 13 hours and 56 minutes
2163780	2169780	And the final blow to defeat evil caused this massive crevice
2169780	2173780	Frank fought the fucking ball-rog?
2173780	2175780	On the left hand side of the train
2175780	2180780	The fog in this absurdly deep canyon clears out even more
2180780	2182780	And you see a church building
2182780	2184780	Still mostly intact
2184780	2187780	But completely upside down
2187780	2192780	Awkwardly stabilized by jutting rocks from both sides
2192780	2196780	The steeple reaches out for the water below
2196780	2199780	But the house of God is well stuck
2199780	2204780	Frank Godel stood tall and victorious after this contest
2204780	2206780	You can see on your left hand side
2206780	2208780	The church did not
2208780	2213780	In its place, the Godel Company cared for Grover's Gorge
2213780	2218780	And kept its residents fed, clothed, housed and safe
2218780	2221780	The screen quickly cuts back to Fred Godel
2221780	2225780	Sitting in his green shirt on his white stool
2225780	2228780	And the Godel Company has continued that practice
2228780	2231780	Into these modern times
2231780	2234780	So open your heart, open your eyes
2234780	2236780	And open your mind
2236780	2241780	Let me show you a future without hunger, without pain
2241780	2244780	Welcome to Grover's Gorge
2250780	2253780	Holy shit dude, this is dope as fuck
2255780	2256780	Oh damn
2256780	2260780	And as the simple steel train car stops, you're on the other side
2261780	2264780	Strangely, it feels identical
2265780	2267780	That's not so strange, you look exactly the same
2267780	2272780	That's right, if everyone could roll heavy machinery, architecture, or search
2272780	2273780	Whichever you'd like
2273780	2275780	I passed search with a 14
2275780	2277780	I also passed search with a 19
2277780	2280780	Whatever it is, I passed it with a teen something
2280780	2282780	Uh, what were you rolling on?
2282780	2283780	Search
2283780	2285780	Okay, so you all rolled search, so
2285780	2287780	It was heavy machinery and what was the other one?
2287780	2289780	Heavy machinery, architecture, or search
2289780	2290780	Gotcha, yep
2290780	2292780	Which I only have one of those
2292780	2294780	So with the success there, you kind of match up
2294780	2297780	Where the door was on the original side
2297780	2300780	Like how far away it was from the station
2300780	2305780	And you can pretty quickly make your way over and find the door through the plant matter
2305780	2307780	On this side as well
2307780	2310780	And there's so much plant matter growing on the door
2310780	2315780	However, it seems to wrap itself in a way in which you can open this door
2315780	2319780	Without needing to like, cut through any of this shit
2319780	2323780	Can I, now that you mentioned the overgrowth, can I retroactively real quick mention
2323780	2328780	Looking around in the train to see its level of decrepitness
2328780	2332780	Like, was it dusty even, or was it feeling brand new in there?
2332780	2335780	How did, I mean like the whole setup really, the station, the lockers
2335780	2338780	Clean, sterile, spartan
2338780	2339780	But like, maintained?
2339780	2346780	Simply due to its cleanliness, you would assume that it is wiped down a decent amount
2346780	2347780	Yeah, okay
2347780	2350780	Used much, or?
2350780	2353780	Used much much?
2353780	2354780	Okay, let me rephrase
2354780	2358780	Without a heavy machinery roll, you're gonna be hard pressed to figure that one out
2358780	2360780	Okay, I don't have any in that, so I won't do it
2360780	2363780	But we rolled search successfully, you
2363780	2365780	Yeah, you rolled to find the door
2365780	2369780	Is there like a path that's been followed through this
2369780	2374780	Or does it seem like we might be one of the few that have used this station?
2374780	2377780	There is not a well-trod path here
2377780	2380780	I tricked him, I tricked him
2380780	2384780	I didn't have any heavy machinery, but I got him to tell me with
2384780	2388780	You used logic in a good way, I like that, good job Luke
2388780	2389780	Can I get a pointy look?
2389780	2390780	Do you have luck already?
2390780	2391780	Nah, I have luck already
2391780	2392780	Okay, nevermind
2392780	2393780	Joe, you can't have any
2393780	2394780	Damn it
2394780	2399780	God damn, I drank all those energy drinks there dude
2399780	2403780	With all that being said, I would like to open the Spongebob door
2403780	2406780	And emerge from the other side
2406780	2408780	Yeah, you guys pack up all your shit and kind of
2408780	2412780	Who lives in a church in the bottom of the ravine?
2412780	2416780	Frankie Godall
2416780	2419780	Battled evil for 13 hours did he
2419780	2423780	Frankie Godall
2423780	2426780	Were there lockers on the other side also?
2426780	2429780	Cause the lockers at the first side was to kind of leave our shit in
2429780	2431780	Yeah, that's a great fucking question
2431780	2434780	There are lockers on this side, it is exactly identical
2434780	2435780	Aw, lame
2435780	2436780	Aw, dip
2436780	2438780	We should have looked in those lockers back there and seen if they were something
2438780	2440780	I mean Stevie did, she put the food in the lockers right?
2440780	2441780	Oh yeah
2441780	2443780	Stevie, did you see anything in those lockers?
2443780	2445780	Oh, I didn't open up a bunch of them
2445780	2449780	I just kind of opened up one and she holds up a key
2449780	2454780	There was already keys in them so I just locked it and I guess this is our key
2454780	2457780	Why don't you like check if it works on one of these over here?
2457780	2462780	And then she walks over and she's holding up a key that is number 5
2462780	2467780	And she's like, oh these are alphabetical on this side it looks like
2467780	2468780	Oh cool
2468780	2470780	Try F
2470780	2471780	Wait, E
2471780	2472780	Try L7
2472780	2473780	Try E
2473780	2477780	She walks up and there are keys in all of the doors on this side
2477780	2478780	Drats
2478780	2479780	Except for
2479780	2481780	There's keys in all of the doors?
2481780	2486780	There's keys in all of the lockers so they're all ready to be used except for one
2486780	2488780	The A locker is locked
2488780	2490780	Stevie, will you try that one real quick?
2490780	2491780	Yeah I guess
2491780	2494780	And she tries to put her key into it and it just kind of jams
2494780	2495780	She's like, ah it doesn't fit
2495780	2496780	Interesting
2496780	2498780	This is so fucking cool
2498780	2499780	I want to open B
2499780	2501780	You open B, it is empty
2501780	2502780	C, D, E
2502780	2503780	Empty, empty, empty
2503780	2504780	Z
2504780	2505780	There's only 20
2505780	2507780	I put my pocket lasagna in B
2507780	2510780	You almost had me for a second
2510780	2514780	What happens as I open up the hatch
2515780	2518780	Oh okay I thought you were going to say the 20th letter of the alphabet
2518780	2520780	No that's obviously 6
2522780	2528780	You guys head on over and Stevie's kind of pack mewling all of your gear over to where this door is
2528780	2534780	And she's like, alright I've got the key here in my pocket so don't let me forget it
2534780	2537780	Stevie, don't forget the key in your pocket
2545780	2548780	Oh sorry guys, Luke just shits pants
2550780	2552780	That was Julius opening up the hatch
2552780	2556780	It opens in the exact same way, this time it opens in toward you
2556780	2562780	And on the other side of this enormous and lush impediment
2562780	2566780	Is a vast opening with plenty to unpack
2567780	2573780	You're looking at a sprawling town park straight out of the 1950's idea of the future
2573780	2579780	Perfectly manicured trees like enormous emerald cake pops
2579780	2583780	Lying a colorful synthetic walkway
2583780	2592780	This slightly bouncy comfortable sidewalk would take you all the way around this gigantic green area ahead of you
2592780	2596780	It's like a big square and the path is a big square going around it
2596780	2600780	And on the far side of this green space
2600780	2604780	Maybe about 255 meters away or so
2604780	2610780	So really far, these people are really tiny, you see tiny people in the distance
2610780	2614780	People wearing like yellow and green uniforms
2614780	2621780	And from all the way across this park, so monumental that they're clear from here
2621780	2624780	There are two statues of men
2624780	2628780	Each about 26.3 meters tall
2628780	2631780	Made of green rock
2631780	2635780	And they stand tall in front of a gorgeous building
2635780	2639780	Seemingly made of glass and grass
2639780	2642780	Or ass
2642780	2646780	There might be ass making it, nobody rides the Godel train for free
2647780	2650780	So it's a big square, you're on one side, the statues are on the other
2650780	2654780	There's a massive square park green space in the middle
2654780	2657780	The trees outline the green space
2657780	2663780	And on the side that you're on, behind you, there's just this enormous wall of plant life
2663780	2665780	You can go left or right
2665780	2666780	To follow the path
2666780	2667780	To follow the path
2667780	2673780	And you would assume that based on what you can see in the park that it would lead you in a big square around
2673780	2677780	Is there what's in the middle? Is it just green space? Literally just green space?
2677780	2685780	Yep, it's a lot of places where people are playing, people are hanging out, picnicking, throwing frisbees
2685780	2688780	Are they all wearing green or yellow uniforms?
2688780	2693780	They're all wearing some sort of green or yellow flair on their clothing
2693780	2697780	You said the pathway was synthetic, colorful, and bouncy?
2697780	2699780	Yeah, I did say that
2699780	2700780	Fuck yeah
2700780	2706780	Cal puts a foot out on it and then gives a few steps out and starts springing a little bit on it
2707780	2711780	Yeah, it looks like even Cal could go for a jog and it wouldn't hurt his knees
2711780	2713780	I haven't felt like this in years
2715780	2716780	Everyone roll grip
2716780	2722780	You are in a completely, seemingly unnatural to you location
2722780	2728780	I failed, 86, Cal starts to think, I haven't felt like this in years
2728780	2736780	As the other two pass, you're both just looking at, is that okay?
2736780	2739780	He stops bouncing on the pathway
2739780	2742780	Stevie, is anything okay?
2742780	2744780	This is weird, huh?
2744780	2748780	This is weird, huh? Beck, you're filming, right?
2748780	2754780	Beck is not only filming, but he's zooming in to try and see if there's anything on the closest uniform
2754780	2756780	If there's any kind of logos or names or anything
2756780	2760780	Yeah, so no logos, everyone seems to be wearing a name tag
2760780	2762780	Does it look like anybody's noticed us?
2762780	2767780	As you're now looking at the people who are walking, people are walking on this pathway
2767780	2773780	And they're all kind of side-eyeing you as they're passing, but no one has approached
2773780	2779780	You see that everyone is wearing nice clothes, they're like very well made
2780780	2787780	Everyone who is walking on the pathway is wearing grey-scale joggers and athleisure
2787780	2790780	But then with a flare of green or a flare of yellow
2790780	2795780	And everyone who's sitting nicely casually, having a picnic, is dressed
2795780	2799780	Everyone's sitting nicely
2799780	2803780	That's the call and response I used when I taught children in Korea
2803780	2806780	Everyone's sitting nicely
2806780	2808780	I was gonna say they're all in Oakland Acor
2808780	2809780	Green and yellow
2809780	2812780	Oh yeah, so it's either green or yellow
2812780	2816780	No one is wearing both that you've seen so far, but everyone is wearing something
2816780	2822780	The people who are sitting at like picnics, the men are wearing like nice black shorts
2822780	2825780	With a green or a yellow polo
2825780	2829780	The women are wearing like a green or a yellow sundress
2829780	2832780	The people who are playing a sport of any kind are
2832780	2836780	Everyone is wearing clothes that are specifically built for what they're doing
2836780	2841780	And everyone has like nice, what you would call like upper shelf athleisure
2841780	2843780	Uh, Cal?
2843780	2844780	Julius
2844780	2845780	You're a pro, right?
2845780	2846780	Julius, I am the pro
2846780	2850780	Beck, from what I know, you're a pro?
2850780	2851780	Yeah dude
2851780	2853780	Let's find out where we are
2853780	2857780	We're in Grover's Gorge, the secret Godel company town
2857780	2860780	Hidden behind a giant mysterious ravine
2860780	2863780	That apparently Frank Godel created in a fight with evil itself
2863780	2867780	Julius has already stopped listening and he's going to find somebody to interview
2867780	2870780	But Cal is nodding vehemently while rolling on Cal
2870780	2872780	Did you call me Ba-Cal?
2872780	2874780	Ma-Cal? What did I say?
2874780	2875780	You said Ma-Cal
2875780	2878780	Rolling on Ba-Beck, Ba-Beck, Ba-Beck
2878780	2884780	The way you were saying that sounded so perfectly angry that Beck instinctively was filming you as you said it
2884780	2885780	We're standing here
2885780	2886780	I've always just had this voice
2886780	2889780	Julius just walks up to the first person he sees and says
2889780	2891780	Uh, would you like to be on TV?
2891780	2896780	Yeah, you look up across this absolutely gorgeous, like stunning park
2896780	2902780	So just like clean and glimmering in the sunshine
2902780	2909780	And there's a woman who's mid-twenties, blonde ponytail bobbing up and down as she's jogging
2909780	2914780	Wearing her like lovely, there are no apples in sight
2914780	2916780	She's not bobbing for apples
2916780	2920780	But her ponytail is bobbing up and down as she's jogging
2920780	2921780	For apples?
2921780	2922780	Towards you
2922780	2925780	Are you glad?
2925780	2929780	Yeah, it would have been sad if he didn't do it again
2929780	2936780	And she kind of like slows her jog as she's kind of approaching you with a quizzical smile on her face
2936780	2939780	Confused, but also curious
2939780	2944780	Cal like kind of turns to face her and reaches out his hand and like puts on a big broad smile and says
2944780	2947780	Cal Colorado, City Action News
2947780	2949780	May we have a moment of your time?
2949780	2952780	Oh yes, of course, yeah, absolutely
2952780	2953780	And she puts out her hand and says
2953780	2956780	Jennifer, it's extremely nice to meet you, welcome
2956780	2959780	Welcome to Grover's Gorge, I see that you're not from here
2959780	2964780	No Jennifer, we're not, we've come here to learn more about your fine town
2964780	2967780	Well welcome, welcome all, again I'm Jennifer and she puts out her hand
2967780	2968780	Speck and Julius
2968780	2971780	Hi Beck, hi Julius, and what's your name?
2971780	2973780	And Stevie puts out their hand and
2973780	2974780	Stevie
2974780	2976780	Yeah, it's nice to meet you Stevie
2976780	2980780	I mean, is this your first time I would assume at Grover's Gorge?
2980780	2982780	Yeah, never made it out here before
2982780	2988780	Welcome, welcome, welcome, oh the Godel Company has treated us so well, woo
2988780	2990780	Go GEs
2990780	2993780	That's actually what brought us out here
2993780	2997780	Could we ask you a few questions about the Godel Company and the gorge?
2997780	3004780	Yeah, absolutely, absolutely, I mean I'm in the middle of a jog, do you mind if I run in place?
3005780	3009780	Yeah, I mean I don't, unfortunately that doesn't play on the camera
3009780	3014780	And she's running in place like, and she's doing high knees now and she's like high knees, high knees, high knees
3014780	3021780	Beck is getting into the camera bag to get out of lapel mic and he's trying to attach it to her and it's kind of difficult because she's jumping up and down in place
3021780	3026780	Uh oh, hey, could you maybe just hang on for just a sec, let me get this attached
3026780	3032780	She slows her roll a little bit, stares you straight into the eyes and is like, I'm doing calf raises
3032780	3038780	Yeah, you are, those are good calf raises, can I have you like say and spell your name for me real quick?
3038780	3043780	Yeah, it's Jennifer, J-E-N-N-I-F-E-R, Jennifer

3045780	3047780	Um, Lang
3054780	3060780	She gets kind of a quizzical look on her face and she's like, can we actually not do a last name, it's just Jennifer
3060780	3064780	Yeah, that's fine, it's just how we're going to credit you on the news, I just wanted to make sure that we get it accurate
3064780	3070780	Jennifer from Grover's Gorge, uh, Godel Company, uh, G-E, woo

3096780	3099780	Did you always hope to work for The Godel Company?

3104780	3105780	What do you mean?
3105780	3109780	Well, I was born here and raised here and everyone works for The Godel Company here in Grover's Gorge
3109780	3113780	No one grows up to leave and become a doctor or an astronaut?
3113780	3118780	Oh, I guess, yeah, if people want to leave they can, but I knew I was going to stay, I like it here
3118780	3120780	Has anyone to your knowledge ever left?

3160780	3166780	Cal is like desperately looking to Beck and Julius and he's like, is that a TikTok thing?
3166780	3169780	I mean, not that I know of, it could be new
3169780	3170780	Looks at Julius

3172780	3175780	Jennifer, is that a TikTok thing?
3175780	3177780	Oh, I don't think so
3177780	3179780	Asked and answered
3179780	3183780	Ask if there's any B-E's, bad employees
3183780	3187780	Jennifer, perhaps a difficult subject
3187780	3188780	Mmm
3188780	3189780	You are a great employee
3189780	3191780	Yeah, I am, ha
3191780	3193780	Are there any bad employees?
3193780	3196780	Oh, I see what you did there, no
3196780	3199780	None of the people who left were bad employees
3199780	3201780	Oh, no, they just left
3201780	3209780	Everyone performs adequately at their job, no one is ever fired or let go or disciplined in any way
3209780	3213780	Well, no, I don't see why they would be, no, no, no, everyone works like
3213780	3222780	We have a really good job here and a really good life here, so I don't see why anyone would not want to work well
3222780	3223780	Does that make sense?
3223780	3225780	That makes sense to Cal
3225780	3233780	And now the corner of each of your eyes, all of your eyes, each and every one of them, you all see
3233780	3236780	How did you know about all my eyes?
3236780	3240780	I read your character sheet
3240780	3243780	Goals, get rid of all these eyes
3243780	3245780	Get rid of all these fucking eyes
3245780	3248780	I didn't fill out my eye, uh
3248780	3253780	Oh, dude, if you don't put at least two, you're fucked
3253780	3254780	Too late now, baby
3254780	3256780	Out of the corner of your eyes, you
3256780	3260780	That's a compelling story, the blind television producer who can never see his own segments
3260780	3264780	But still longs to struggle in the industry, or succeed in the industry
3264780	3266780	Longs to struggle in the industry
3266780	3269780	Does struggle in the industry, longs to succeed
3269780	3272780	My taste is so good, though, that I can
3272780	3275780	Oh, yeah, you're actual
3275780	3277780	My taste is with my tongue
3277780	3281780	I thought you meant you had like Daredevil vision, but for reality television
3281780	3283780	No, I can taste anything
3283780	3289780	Your taste is great, and so is your vision, which means that you can see out of the corner of your eye
3289780	3290780	All of them?
3290780	3292780	A jackalope
3292780	3295780	Wait, is a jackalope the rabbit with antlers?
3295780	3297780	It's the mythical creature with antlers, yeah
3297780	3299780	It's a rabbit with antlers
3299780	3300780	A rabbit with antlers
3300780	3303780	And it's got a yellow ribbon tied around its head
3303780	3304780	Around its head?
3304780	3305780	Yeah, like
3305780	3306780	Around its antlers, or?
3306780	3307780	Yeah
3307780	3309780	Cal's jaw drops
3309780	3312780	Julius immediately starts filming it on his phone
3312780	3315780	Beck whips around to it and says out loud
3315780	3317780	You guys got a jackalope?
3322780	3324780	Jennifer, what is that?
3342780	3353780	Are we recording?
3353780	3355780	The people love this
3355780	3356780	They love what?
3356780	3359780	They love the roid talk
3359780	3361780	You just said what now?
3361780	3364780	I have my first Aldi hemorrhoid
3364780	3366780	No, it doesn't hurt, it's fine
3366780	3368780	It's just a firm little guy
3368780	3369780	I need 30 seconds of silence
3369780	3370780	Fun little guy
3370780	3372780	Firm
3376780	3378780	He's just a, hey, you should get to know him
3378780	3379780	He's just a fun little guy
3379780	3380780	He's just a silly little guy
3380780	3381780	He's just popping out to say hello
3381780	3383780	He's a lot like you, Zach
3384780	3386780	Bald little head poking out of your asshole
3390780	3393780	And it's all my fault
3400780	3403780	Thanks for watching!
