0	7960	This is yet another introduction to the radio show known as 694.2 PTBP,
7960	15720	the galaxy's only radio station that is technically also maybe a toxic waste site.
15720	21480	You all know me, and if you don't, my name's DJ Wolf the dog,
21480	29200	here to howl out some things at y'all before something else starts happening right after I stop talking.
29200	34360	Have I ever stuck around even one second after my segment ends?
34360	36520	Damn, you know I haven't.
36520	42840	I clock out and skitter as fast as my limbs can skitter out to the municipal dump.
42840	46200	It's all you can eat every day, baby.
46200	51400	And speaking of howling, and skittering, and me, Wolf the dog,
51400	55680	it's time to skitter on over to a new howling with Wolf.
55720	58280	Howl
58280	64480	This show's howling with Wolf is from Gwenivere in Greenville, North Carolina,
64480	68680	who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.
68680	73480	What's that? You haven't tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod?
73480	75400	That's so weird.
75400	79840	You should be more like Gwenivere in Greenville, North Carolina,
79840	83760	and tweet about the show and tag at Pretending Pod.
83800	87200	Gwenivere in Greenville, North Carolina, writes,
87200	89120	Greetings, Wolf.
89120	96000	I'm writing you from some weird liminal dimension I stumbled into while cleaning carpets in some old church.
96000	98400	Overall, it isn't too bad.
98400	103880	I just wish they had more food than these strange bits of jerky with hair on them,
103880	107400	and wine that tastes more like pennies than wine.
107400	111960	I want to give a shout out to my best friend Ash and girlfriend Kaylee,
111960	115520	as well as everyone who works on this podcast.
115520	121120	Y'all have got me through more hard times than I can count and made me laugh just as many.
121120	122120	Damn.
122120	129120	Well, I hope you can turn that liminal dimension into a liminalade dimension, you know what I'm saying?
129120	133560	And if you could, uh, email me some of them jerky bits,
133560	140760	I would be mighty delighted to partake in whatever or whoever it is.
140760	147400	Now, if you want to write up something for your wolf to howl, tag at Pretending Pod on Twitter,
147400	152000	fuck the musk, tag at Pretending Pod on Instagram, fuck the zuck,
152000	156680	or tag pretending to be people on Facebook, fuck the zuck double time.
156680	161040	Or write us up a five-star review on the podcast app of your choice,
161040	164800	and make sure it gets in front of my dang eyeballs.
164800	167800	And fuck whoever owns podcasts.
167840	172920	And if you happen to have forgotten, the links are in the show notes.
172920	173920	That's right.
173920	179480	Whether you want to give us money in exchange for bonus content on Patreon,
179480	182680	or cop some new drip at the merch store,
182680	187400	or join the listener communities on Discord and Reddit,
187400	194600	or vibe to a selection of tracks from the PTBPOST on YouTube,
194600	198240	you can find those links in the show notes.
198240	203880	And now, for our top ten shortest news segments, it's the news.
203880	207440	Last time, the gang went to the Zeitgeist,
207440	211480	the abandoned and very unimpressive city Space Needle,
211480	214240	and then Dr. Brock Hargrave,
214240	216840	no, no way, this can't be right,
216840	222240	says here, Dr. Hargrave brought a couple of sedated folks on leashes
222280	225880	up to the spot he'd been digging, smoked some meth,
225880	229840	plunged a syringe in the dude, stuck a finger in his own ear
229840	232120	and then promptly into his own mouth,
232120	235440	and then that very zonked-out dude
235440	240440	just climbed into the abdomen of Dr. Brock Hargrave
240440	242520	and disappeared?
242520	246320	Also making a disappearance for the final time,
246320	251320	it's Hudson Freeman with muscles all sprees.
282240	312040	You are now listening to the final episode
312040	315680	of our four-episode series, Fuck Me.
315680	317400	Oh, do you want to take that one again?
317400	319320	Do you want to do that?
319320	320640	What a gentleman.
320640	323920	Holy cow farms, leave it in.
323920	327960	Oh, right, no, we now know that burps are not only important
327960	330080	but life-changing to our listeners,
330080	331880	so we got to leave them in.
331880	334120	Also, we're sponsored by Aldi and those burps,
334120	338680	brought to you by Aldi Generic Sparkling Water.
338680	343520	It's Bell V Sparkling Water Tangerine by Pure Aqua.
343520	346080	Hey, Zach, I'm sorry, but you have a dozen cases of those
346080	348000	in your house and you don't know what the fuck it's called
348000	349160	without looking at the can.
349160	353160	It's because you have the koozie.
353160	355880	That's exactly right, I'm covering it up constantly.
355880	357520	24-7 koozied up.
357520	359200	And he knows how to read, for sure.
359200	360920	I just think it's weird to not use a koozie
360920	364360	and touch a cold can, like that's fucked up to me.
365760	368480	I have so many koozies in a drawer of my house
369120	371120	and I've never once used any of them.
371120	375000	Same, Zach and his wife have the same drawer
375000	377240	but they use them all the time and it's pretty great,
377240	380000	honestly, they're always like handing you one
380000	381920	when you have a cold beverage at their house.
381920	382760	It's a nice touch.
382760	384880	You're making me question my koozie behavior.
384880	386120	Yeah, I mean, you've got them.
386120	389400	Keep them in the drawer, that's where mine are.
389400	393360	You don't fuse, you're gonna lose.
393360	394480	That's exactly right.
394480	395320	That's what they always say.
395320	396400	I forgot how to say the word.
396400	398400	That's what Taylor's back tattoo says.
400400	401840	Right above Richard Nixon.
407360	408440	It was supposed to be a cover up
408440	409880	but it just looks cooler now.
411040	412920	Sweet, does your wife really have a tattoo
412920	414200	of Richard Nixon on her back?
414200	417040	No, Roger Stone does.
417040	417880	Oh, right.
417880	419120	What happened last week?
419120	421360	Wolf already told us, let's dive into this shit.
421360	422520	Oh yeah, thanks Wolf.
423360	428000	I think maybe we need to go talk to him or get him,
428000	430720	but I am not leaving here without dropping this
430720	431560	in the hole.
431560	433080	You say as you roll grip,
433080	438080	as you all see this dude disappear into the torso
439200	440640	of Dr. Brock Hargrave.
444200	445040	I pass.
445040	446560	Shelly passes also.
446560	450440	I've opened enough people to, you know.
450440	451280	Same.
451280	452840	The hook passes as well.
452840	456480	Okay, everyone is going to lose one grip still.
456480	459720	This is strange enough that it stops you all in your tracks
459720	462720	and you're left just watching.
462720	463640	Just checking.
463640	467800	Did you guys also see that guy roll up his belly
467800	471400	like it was a carpet and put another man inside?
471400	472240	We sure did.
472240	475360	How does a man fit in another man like that?
475360	476480	He just walked right in.
476480	479160	He absolutely devoured him like my career.
479160	482800	It was like he went into a tiny set of stairs,
482800	485240	like there was a vanishing point
485240	487880	and he got smaller as he walked towards the belly,
487880	490240	but it didn't make any sense.
490240	491400	It was kind of amusing.
491400	494320	We got to go save that woman before she walks
494320	495680	into his belly.
495680	498000	There's only one quick way down.
500640	501480	I made hook.
501480	502320	I know what you're thinking.
502320	504280	I think we got to ride the Bigfoot.
504280	505120	Well, okay.
506240	507640	That's not what's going to happen.
507640	509080	I'm sorry, you're going to die.
509960	511520	If you try that.
511520	512360	With a Bigfoot landing.
512360	517000	I would like to pry open the elevator doors.
517000	517840	Oh, fuck yeah.
517840	519040	And look down the shaft
519040	523720	and see if my good old buddy elevator cable is still there.
523720	525360	Go ahead and roll criminology.
526600	527440	Nope.
528720	533160	Okay, so you get these elevator doors pried open
533160	536200	and you're looking at the shaft,
536200	538280	the empty shaft ahead of you.
538320	541920	And you see that the cables that go all the way
541920	544520	down the bottom are like frayed to the point
544520	546880	to where you think if you were to like jump on
546880	551600	and try to shimmy down, it might break.
551600	555400	Dang, my usual method of going downstairs
555400	557320	is out of adequate question.
557320	558160	It's okay.
558160	560520	I'm sure we'll encounter a sewer very soon.
560520	563680	Fellas, any ideas about how to save that woman's life?
563680	565440	We got to check the toilets.
565440	566280	Maybe there's a cow toilet.
566280	567840	See if we can get flushed down.
568360	570680	Yes, maybe there's a cow toilet in the restaurant.
570680	573000	We don't know how fresh their beef was.
573000	575280	Is there a giant cow-sized toilet
575280	577040	to get flushed down on this level?
577040	578720	All right, let me roll now.
581720	583200	Meat hook in this line of work,
583200	585920	sometimes the person gets eaten.
585920	587800	You all don't even care.
587800	589520	You look so complacent.
589520	591520	Isn't this your dude, Shelly?
591520	592640	Why is he doing that?
592640	594200	It's not that we don't care.
594200	598360	It's just that stopping him is our only option here.
598360	602440	And right now we've got to find a way to stop him.
602440	605200	We also don't know that they're not perfectly fine in there.
605200	607320	We can also take this out on our children
607320	609300	or wives or whatever later.
610480	612440	Specifically for that we've written down.
612440	615560	Yeah, like subtracting from your bonds.
615560	616680	Something like that, yeah.
616680	617720	Metaphorically.
617720	621000	Is there a door to where the old observation deck
621000	623520	used to be even though I know the deck fell off?
623560	625040	That is correct, there is a door
625040	627280	and it's got tape like over it
627280	631800	trying to warn people to not go in this general area
631800	634560	as it is dangerous as the door is not there.
634560	638340	It's just the open wind, the summer wind coming through
638340	640360	and the smell of the parking lot.
640360	643280	Does it happen to be right over the holes?
643280	644560	Oh yeah, of course it is.
644560	646080	I can't get open.
646080	648760	Do something, throw something at him.
648760	651400	Hey, take this and we'll do it at the same time
651400	654000	and I give her the small Bigfoot
654000	656280	and I dangle the Bigfoot over the hole
656280	658280	which he happens to be close to, right?
658280	660480	On the count of three we're gonna clap
660480	665000	which requires both hands which will make us drop these.
665000	668080	I see exactly what you're going for and I'm in.
668080	669860	One, two, three.
671960	672840	Go ahead and roll.
672840	674020	The foot's full.
674020	675740	What are we rolling for?
676600	680680	I think you can either roll dexterity or athletics here.
680680	681520	Or Bigfoot.
681520	683920	Or Bigfoot obviously, dropping Bigfoot
683920	684760	if that's a craft skill.
684760	686760	Yeah, I got a 46, that's a pass.
686760	687720	Nice.
687720	690440	I didn't hear any of the things that you said
690440	691260	to go for. What did you roll?
691260	692100	25.
692100	694720	Oh, what is your dexterity or athletics?
694720	695560	More than that.
695560	698000	Yes it is and with that,
698000	701220	describe these two bigfoots falling please.
701220	703760	It's just like a long beard
703760	708760	and a kind of Neanderthal face with a hairy body
709760	712880	but it's got, it's like a plastic troll doll underneath
712880	716600	so it's pretty hard when it's coming at speed.
716600	717440	Oh yeah.
717440	718260	Flung.
718260	721840	It's companion, same thing, much larger
721840	723540	and I said it was stuffed, it's not.
723540	725540	It's also got the big, hard troll body.
725540	729860	And they're somersaulting through the air
729860	733760	as if they're in a beautiful ballet in the sky.
733760	735920	It's stuffed with trolls.
735920	738160	Exactly, and the truth.
738160	740160	I'm aiming for the dude.
740160	744720	I wanna distract him so that he comes after us
744720	746480	and we can save this woman's life.
746480	747320	Fantastic.
747320	748600	I'm aiming for the hole.
748600	751080	Okay, one bigfoot, large one?
751080	752640	I had the large one, yes.
752640	755840	Goes directly, perfect hit, dude perfect
755840	760160	from the top of the zeitgeist into the bottom of this hole
760160	762440	and as it hits the bottom.
762440	766280	Vincenti braces to be teleported back to non-existence.
767240	771640	It bounces and then lands softly, lifelessly
771640	775200	like a stuffed bigfoot that you might get at a carnival
775200	776900	at the bottom of a dirt pit.
776900	780400	And the other bigfoot knocks Dr. Brock Hargrave
780400	784240	right in the hand as he pulls out a syringe, shatters it.
784240	788720	I rolled combat for the woman who he was going for
788720	790380	and Luke, what did I roll?
790380	794520	You rolled what I assume is a critical success with a 22.
794520	797880	And then I rolled damage for when she grabs the shovel.
797880	801820	Right, she grabbed a shovel which I assume is a D8.
801820	804400	So he rolled a D8 and he got an eight.
804400	807720	Even up from like from up here, we can see it glistens.
807720	812720	And the sharp tip goes directly in to the soft belly.
812920	814360	That's where all the people are.
814360	816360	Of Dr. Brock Hargrave.
816360	817840	The extra soft belly.
820520	822160	He falls to his knees.
822160	825040	You see blood splattering out onto the ground.
825040	827640	I need everyone to roll grip again for violence.
828680	829880	Can Shelley celebrate?
829880	830720	18.
830720	831540	A custom.
832700	834640	I am happy at this violence.
835680	838880	Vincente goes, fucking excellent shot kid.
838880	840060	And then he throws up.
842360	843960	Lose one grip.
843960	844800	For failing?
844800	845620	For failing.
845620	846460	Shelley lost.
846460	849840	Lose one grip for failing as you also have
849840	852880	just like a stomach turning reaction.
852880	854160	That should have been me.
859160	861920	Don't worry doc, there's a lot of professional rivals
861920	863280	you might one day get to kill.
863280	865480	I believe Jimmy Corrigan is.
865480	866360	I thought he was adapted.
866360	868360	That was actually a different character.
869680	871760	So I rolled and passed which makes sense.
871760	873220	Cause he's seen a lot of death.
873220	875520	Seen a lot of death, seen a lot of blood.
875520	877680	It continues to just ooze out
877680	881400	and you see one of his intestines falls out of the hole
881400	883600	onto the ground, dripping.
883600	887800	And he's just kind of shaking violently on his knees
887800	888640	and then he falls.
888640	890280	I feel like we should go down there.
890280	893920	But if Meadhope glances around the top of this observatory
893920	896400	real quick, is there anything else of interest up here?
896400	897360	What are you looking for?
897360	901600	What about a length of rope that they used to hang aliens
901600	903840	off the side of during the parties?
904680	907640	Or perhaps a banner?
907640	909120	A banner is good.
909120	910160	Rush hour two style.
910160	912040	Okay, we've had a couple of bad experiences
912040	913720	but I think we're all getting pretty lazy.
913720	915520	I think we can handle the stairs.
920320	922000	Vincent has his eyes closed.
924000	925540	I rolled a hundred.
925540	930540	Oh, wait, I'm gonna use my, wait, what this word?
931040	931880	That's a one.
931880	933200	Ooh, he found a loophole.
933440	934800	I'm gonna use my luck.
934800	937160	He can make it a one?
937160	938000	Yeah.
938000	938820	Boom.
938820	939660	Luck spent.
939660	940480	Ooh, I like it.
940480	942280	You only have half a luck, take mine.
943360	945840	Vincent grabs half of a luck,
945840	949200	forms it with his own half luck, spins it to...
949200	952400	You almost fall head first into a closet, but then...
952400	957320	Look at this industrial strength rope with climbing gear.
957320	959600	Yeah, with a crit success,
959600	961280	you just find like a fireman's ladder
961320	964080	that's used for exactly this purpose.
964080	965240	Yeah, it's in the closet.
965240	966640	It's just in the back of the closet.
966640	967480	You move some stuff out of the way.
967480	968480	You have to clown fireman's ladder
968480	970440	so it's shoved in there, but when you get it out.
970440	972240	It goes to the ground, there's a hole in the ground.
972240	974900	Yeah, because ladders are easier to go down than stairs.
974900	976120	Everybody knows that.
977000	979360	Right, less dangerous, more stable.
979360	981280	Oh, you guys don't have to roll for a fireman's ladder.
981280	985560	He does the, he presses the extendo release button
985560	988040	on the fireman's ladder and it just shoots down
988040	989880	to the bottom and I look at Mead Hook
989880	991400	and say, get scuttling, kid.
991400	992800	I scuttle.
992800	995200	When I's told to scuttle, I scuttle.
996760	999680	A tear forms in Jimmy's eyes and he's like,
999680	1001200	he didn't say shimmy.
1003480	1006840	I need everyone shimmying down to roll.
1006840	1007960	I'm taking the stairs.
1007960	1009680	Alertness or dexterity.
1009680	1012600	And if you're taking the stairs, do the same.
1012600	1015880	Just an eight, a definite success.
1015880	1016720	Success in here.
1016720	1019440	Finally able to go up and or down.
1020440	1022360	Something fashion to do just that.
1023920	1025880	We get to use your hands and your feet on this one,
1025880	1026720	so it's easier.
1028080	1030400	I pass my scuttle.
1030400	1031600	Scuttle.
1031600	1035300	I pass my stairs, but I fail my alertness,
1035300	1037040	which makes sense because I'm the only one
1037040	1038720	going down the stairwell.
1038720	1039560	I failed.
1039560	1040400	Dead silent.
1040400	1041640	Oh, I didn't roll alertness.
1044240	1045080	Fail alert.
1045080	1045920	Not alert.
1047360	1049960	I'm focusing on safely scuttling.
1049960	1051320	I pass alertness.
1051320	1054180	Okay, as the four of you are heading down
1054180	1056620	to the base of the zeitgeist,
1056620	1060000	Jimmy Corrigan and the stairs all alone meet Hook
1060000	1062720	and Vincent D'Bori focusing deeply
1062720	1064800	on making their way down the pole.
1064800	1065800	Scuttle, scuttle, scuttle.
1065800	1070800	And Shelly St. Blythe, who is lively going down
1071440	1073880	and you notice that there's a window actually
1073920	1076320	out this side, just like a thin window
1076320	1077680	going all the way down.
1077680	1080560	So you've got a clear view as you head down
1080560	1083740	this fireman's pole for not a single fireman in sight.
1083740	1086560	And you see this woman just shaking,
1086560	1088800	her hands covered in blood,
1088800	1092160	and she kicks the body of Dr. Brock Hargrave
1092160	1095240	into one of the holes and begins covering it
1095240	1097400	with the mound of dirt that's next to it
1097400	1098800	as fast as she can.
1098800	1100520	Wait, we'll help you.
1100520	1101760	We saw everything.
1101760	1102600	What?
1102600	1103440	You're all right.
1103960	1106120	Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
1106120	1107360	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1107360	1108220	No one could have seen that.
1108220	1109060	No one could have known.
1109060	1109880	We're the good guys.
1109880	1111480	Who the fuck are you?
1111480	1112520	My name's Brandy.
1112520	1113620	You're a fine girl.
1113620	1116120	If you were worried about being incriminated,
1116120	1117880	now I got more information.
1120800	1122040	Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
1122040	1123120	Brandy, it's okay.
1123120	1125800	I'm just trying to teach you a little bit about the world
1125800	1127800	as my dads did for me.
1127800	1130440	Brandy, how'd this guy find you?
1130440	1134160	We were just, we were just at a bar.
1134160	1137680	Oh shit, shit, shit, where, where's, where's.
1137680	1139400	Which bar did he find you at?
1141120	1141960	The Iliad.
1142880	1145560	Fuck, fuck, where's Brandon?
1145560	1146480	Where's Brandon?
1146480	1148000	Jimmy sighs deeply and he's like,
1148000	1149960	your boyfriend's name is Brandon.
1151480	1152880	Oh shit, my name's Brandy.
1152880	1154920	Okay, I see, I hear it now.
1154920	1156840	You never heard it before?
1156840	1158720	Nobody ever thought that was weird?
1159720	1161280	You're just now getting this.
1161280	1164040	I didn't, no, it's not the time.
1164040	1166040	It's not the time, but I also wanna say,
1166040	1167400	Brandy, we don't know for sure
1167400	1168840	that if you hadn't gutted that man,
1168840	1171920	we couldn't have gotten Brandon safely out of there.
1171920	1172960	Out of where?
1172960	1175400	Yeah, he's in his stomach.
1175400	1176960	We might as well try.
1176960	1179880	And he brushes away some of the dirt
1179880	1182600	and tries to open the stomach.
1182600	1184280	Do you hop down into the?
1184280	1185440	No, I peer in.
1185440	1187160	Okay, so you're gonna have to like lay down
1187160	1188360	on the ground to like. Sure.
1188880	1189920	Okay, so you lay down on the ground
1189920	1193880	with your arms outstretched down to the bottom of this pit.
1193880	1197440	You're like pulling at the wound?
1197440	1201320	Yeah, at the wound, I guess, yeah.
1201320	1205160	Or like trying to, did I see him belly button pull?
1205160	1208200	I mean, now there's a gash there
1208200	1210520	where she stabbed him with the shovel.
1210520	1211880	So it's really easy to do now.
1211880	1213960	Yeah, I use that opening.
1213960	1217240	Roll grip, because that's fucking gross.
1217240	1218080	It is.
1219920	1221920	40 on a 40.
1221920	1222760	Damn.
1222760	1226160	With his success, you lose no grip on reality
1226160	1228400	as you have done this kind of shit before.
1228400	1233400	And everyone kind of notices the like steady sure hand
1233960	1238440	that Vincentibori is taking as he pulls apart the abdomen
1238440	1241760	of Dr. Brock Hargrave inside of this pit.
1241760	1243360	I worked at the old man's meat shop.
1243360	1246680	I done it a hundred times, except on like animals, but.
1246960	1248640	Intestines begin falling out.
1248640	1252320	Blood is just covering your hands now, Vincenti.
1252320	1256680	And you see there's a kidney's spleen.
1256680	1261080	It's just like all just in your hands as you're reaching in.
1261080	1264200	Yeah, there's no, there's no Brandon in here.
1264200	1265040	What?
1265040	1267880	She just throws up all over the ground.
1267880	1271640	I thought he was just there.
1271640	1272480	Starts crying.
1272480	1273320	It's okay, Brandon.
1273320	1275120	You kind of fucked this whole thing up for us, Brandy.
1275520	1277800	I'm gonna touch her hair to calm her.
1279000	1279840	It's okay.
1279840	1281480	I seen people do this.
1286120	1287960	Hey doctor, do you know anything
1287960	1289440	about what's in that syringe?
1289440	1290360	I'm almost there.
1290360	1291200	Give me a moment.
1292960	1294960	He's coming down the last few rungs.
1294960	1295800	What did I miss?
1295800	1296640	What did I miss?
1296640	1297680	Oh, doc.
1297680	1298720	Vincenti.
1298720	1300240	They're not in his intestines.
1300240	1301920	Eviscerated somebody.
1303080	1303920	I see.
1303920	1304760	It's okay though.
1304760	1306240	He went to work in his old man's meat shop.
1306240	1307200	I guess the intestines
1307200	1308160	were already out. I did.
1308160	1309920	So there was that.
1309920	1313320	And I suppose you did not find the man inside there.
1313320	1315600	No, Brandon, this is Brandy.
1315600	1316640	Hey Brandy.
1316640	1318400	And her boyfriend's name was Brandon.
1318400	1319800	Yee-hoo!
1319800	1321440	Brandy and Brandon, huh, yes.
1321440	1323520	We all saw him go in there though.
1323520	1326520	There's gotta be a trap door to this belly or something.
1326520	1328720	I do wanna pick up that syringe and take a look at it.
1328720	1330400	I've got 40 forensics.
1330400	1332080	Is that something that would cover?
1332080	1334000	It wouldn't, no.
1334000	1335520	I've also got, oh no, I don't have-
1335520	1336800	Oh, I have pharmacy.
1336800	1337640	Yeah.
1337640	1339400	Pharmacy will do it.
1339400	1340960	Hold on.
1340960	1344600	I've seen a syringe or two in my day.
1347840	1349160	Let me take a look-see.
1349160	1350880	Thank you, laughter.
1350880	1351960	That's a 17.
1351960	1352800	That'll do.
1352800	1354360	Ooh.
1354360	1355440	What does that mean?
1355440	1357160	What's in the syringe?
1357160	1360640	You kind of squirt some out the tip of the syringe
1360640	1363640	and smell it and you know that it is
1363640	1368640	some sort of a tranquilizer, like a horse tranquilizer,
1368920	1371680	some like ketamine adjacent.
1371680	1373520	So nothing supernatural.
1373520	1374360	No.
1374360	1376400	Hey, Rowan, are you still up in that tower?
1376400	1377240	Yes, I am.
1377240	1378240	Thank you for asking.
1378240	1381680	God, why are you just the worst?
1382800	1383960	So unambitious.
1383960	1386800	Do you know anything about what's happening here?
1386800	1389480	Rowan is just shaking their head vigorously,
1389480	1391400	just back and forth.
1391400	1394040	No, no, no.
1394040	1396440	We could put it in him and see what it does
1396440	1397840	and then he won't talk anymore.
1397840	1398680	No.
1398680	1403240	And you see that the face of Rowan kind of disappears
1403240	1404720	as they walk backwards.
1404720	1408080	Once you say an idea, we gotta do it.
1408080	1413080	She shoves the needle in her hand, broken or not,
1413360	1414360	into his arm.
1414360	1415760	As he slides down the pole.
1416840	1421160	Rowan walks up to the group and you shove the syringe
1421160	1424200	into their arm and they're just like completely
1424200	1425600	not ready for it.
1425600	1427120	Completely caught off guard.
1427120	1427960	It's all right.
1427960	1428800	It's all right.
1433800	1436960	I'm a raptor.
1436960	1437840	Nobody panic.
1437840	1439800	I don't think they're actually a raptor.
1439800	1441000	I feel like a raptor.
1442520	1443360	Okay.
1443360	1446560	And Rowan is just like laughing, giggling,
1446560	1450840	and then they just kind of go quiet, staring at the ground.
1450840	1452520	I think he's just regular high.
1453720	1455000	This is a Christian podcast,
1455000	1456040	so we don't know what that's like.
1456040	1459120	So you imagine you're a dinosaur, right?
1459120	1462160	No, I mean, the only time I've done ketamine, the...
1462160	1467160	You were a raptor?
1467440	1469960	One of the people in the room thought he was a raptor,
1469960	1472040	started jumping up on all the furniture
1472040	1474920	with a couple of claws out, just kind of being a goober.
1474920	1476520	That didn't have anything to do with the ketamine.
1476520	1478720	That guy was probably just a raptor.
1478720	1482400	With my arms, it's still inside Dr. Prock.
1482400	1485520	So what the fuck do we do now?
1485520	1486360	Well.
1486360	1487640	This was the guy we were looking for.
1487640	1491880	I mean, I guess we could just tell Ruth Moses Esther
1491880	1492720	that we found him.
1492720	1494800	It seems like mission accomplished, yes.
1494800	1496320	I'm gonna give her a call.
1496320	1497960	Oh, I don't have a cell phone, though.
1497960	1500640	I like, yeah, I like kind of like nod my head to-
1500640	1502520	Turn your head to the side like you just did.
1502520	1505640	Yeah, nod my head to like where my back pocket,
1505640	1506480	where my cell phone is.
1506480	1507840	That's weird.
1507840	1512840	I'm laying down on the ground with blood all over my hands.
1513680	1515040	I grab the phone.
1515040	1516600	I give her a ring.
1516600	1519400	Ring, ring, ring, ring.
1519400	1521080	Vincenzi, Vincenzi, what's going on?
1521080	1526080	Hello, it is me, Meat Hook, on the telephone.
1526680	1527520	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1527520	1528920	Great phone etiquette, kid.
1528920	1531360	Yeah, so Meat Hook, is Vincenzi okay?
1531360	1532200	Is everyone okay?
1532200	1533280	Have you figured it out?
1533280	1535160	Have you found Dr. Prock?
1535160	1536800	We found him.
1536800	1539520	Everyone is not okay.
1539520	1544520	Dr. Hargrave's guts are outside his body.
1544560	1548840	And, well, do you know anything about supernaturally
1548840	1551720	putting people inside yourself?
1551720	1555440	No, did you see anything like that occur?
1555440	1559960	Or I assume that you could get inside.
1559960	1560800	Do you know how it's done?
1560800	1561960	Do you know how it's done?
1561960	1562800	Did he tell you?
1562800	1564600	Well, we can't get any information
1564640	1567960	because he was murdered before we arrived here.
1567960	1570120	Hold on, let me check his pulse.
1570120	1574320	And I just kind of, don't move my hand for a little bit.
1574320	1576880	Is there, do I feel a pulse?
1576880	1580840	The blood has stopped like splooshing
1580840	1582680	like at a heartbeats rate.
1582680	1586400	Yeah, no, we can't ask him anything right now.
1586400	1588720	He's dead, he's dead, he's dead.
1588720	1590560	So how, did you take him out?
1590560	1592160	We met someone named Brandy.
1592160	1594480	She's wearing club wear.
1594480	1597520	And she's just, it was kind of self-defense.
1597520	1598520	Brandy, are you there?
1598520	1600360	Let me give her the phone.
1600360	1601200	Oh shit.
1603200	1605000	Cool, I enjoy talking to your own NBC.
1607400	1608240	I like that he paused.
1608240	1611040	So you wanted to rip off comedy bang bang, right?
1611040	1613240	Until, all until you.
1613240	1614280	Completely forgot.
1614280	1616200	He paused to wait for a response.
1616200	1617040	Was the deal.
1617040	1618360	I would have to answer that.
1618360	1622360	Let's see how it's done.
1624800	1627600	Did you see anything strange or out of the ordinary
1627600	1628720	throughout the process?
1632680	1634080	She's useless, take her out.
1636400	1638760	Like that's why they call it a handler.
1638760	1640160	Take her out, out.
1640160	1642800	Yeah, casualties are acceptable on this mission.
1642800	1644320	If I didn't tell you that before,
1644320	1646080	I think you should know by now.
1646120	1650120	Hey, Meat Hook, I think it's time you prove yourself.
1650120	1652080	No, I don't want to kill her.
1652080	1653440	Good, you proved yourself.
1655640	1658600	Ruth, how should we proceed?
1658600	1660480	I mean, we found the target.
1660480	1662760	I guess you bring her back here, I guess.
1662760	1666440	And did you learn what he was trying to figure out?
1666440	1667280	No.
1667280	1669480	Shelly kind of walks up.
1669480	1671960	Does lost in the fungus mean anything to you?
1671960	1673280	To the fungus.
1673280	1676400	I mean, yeah, I've heard people going missing,
1676400	1679800	people talk about people getting lost in the fungus.
1679800	1680640	Disappear.
1680640	1682000	That's just an expression?
1684400	1685880	It's common between the cowboys.
1685880	1689280	It's an old city expression, yeah.
1689280	1692640	Lazarus, you seem a bit agitated.
1692640	1693720	You seem a bit agitated.
1693720	1695520	No, everything is so clear now.
1695520	1699400	You seem a bit more manic than when we last spoke.
1699400	1700680	Manic because I'm on the right path
1700680	1701960	doing all the right things.
1702440	1705800	Is this the path that our mutual friends have set you on
1705800	1708040	or is this a path of self-discovery?
1708040	1709000	What's the difference?
1709000	1711680	You take your directions from me
1711680	1714120	because I am the handler, I'm in charge.
1714120	1716320	It's possible she's become a raptor,
1716320	1717600	if you know what I mean.
1717600	1719880	I'm getting big raptor energy here.
1720720	1722480	Hey, we never asked and we should have.
1722480	1725760	Why did your place reek of cat piss when there were no cats?
1725760	1727960	I've been trying to, I've been having to stay up,
1727960	1730920	I've been having to stay up to take care of this mission.
1730920	1732800	What does that have to do with cat piss?
1732800	1736440	Oh, you've been buying from the strummers.
1736440	1737840	Or producing.
1737840	1741880	Okay, okay, oh, oh, oh, I'm all high and mighty.
1741880	1743720	I've never done anything weird or bad
1743720	1746240	that the dare officer would disapprove of in my life.
1746240	1748600	I'm a fucking piece of shit square.
1748600	1751680	Okay, like that's, we got to do with the things
1751680	1753960	that the commission makes us have to do
1753960	1756600	because I had to stay awake and I had to find the numbers
1756600	1760200	and I had to figure it out and it's 836, 836.
1760200	1763000	It's around holy cow farms and it's, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1763000	1766320	Hey, 836, we found holes that say that.
1766320	1768840	I don't know if we should give her any more information.
1768840	1770800	Yes, I feel that she may be compromised.
1770800	1773640	That's what time we were supposed to meet.
1773640	1775160	At the Bible study.
1775160	1776000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1776000	1777320	Holy shit.
1777320	1778360	That's right, that's right.
1778360	1780240	That's some fucking good note taking.
1781600	1784760	Hey, this is something that's not come up as players ever.
1784760	1788720	What do you do when your Delta Green handler is insane?
1789240	1790080	Who do you call?
1792120	1794560	I mean, not the obvious answer to that question.
1794560	1796720	Yeah, just the cops.
1798560	1799880	The cops.
1801840	1803080	I don't know what to do.
1803080	1805160	Meat Hook, could you take her off speakerphone
1805160	1806560	for just a second?
1806560	1807400	Yeah.
1807400	1808960	Don't take me off speakerphone.
1808960	1812520	I'm sorry, Lazarus, Ruth, we need to have a sidebar.
1812520	1813840	I already hung up on her.
1813840	1817200	So I think we got to, I get up off the ground.
1819320	1821120	I stopped playing with his guts.
1821120	1822080	Wet hands.
1822080	1824120	Maybe she knows something about the numbers though.
1824120	1826360	Maybe that's a bigger clue.
1826360	1829320	Eight, three, six.
1829320	1830880	I don't know.
1830880	1832520	Do you think there's anything to be learned
1832520	1834320	at Trigate Supply?
1835280	1836880	I guess not until the morning.
1839600	1842240	Well, she wanted us to bring his body back,
1842240	1844320	but that feels very incriminating.
1844320	1846000	I mean, we didn't even kill him.
1846000	1848320	Also, you should probably get all that blood
1848360	1849600	off your hands, Vincente.
1849600	1851360	He is also already in a hole.
1851360	1853160	A whole lot of trouble.
1853160	1855600	Usually I just do what she asked me to do
1855600	1858360	and it's proven to be the best choice so far.
1858360	1861280	So, I mean, I think we just-
1861280	1863040	Vincente, you heard her.
1863040	1864360	She's not the same person
1864360	1866080	who was making those calls before.
1866080	1867400	She's gone.
1867400	1868320	She's not gone.
1868320	1869880	We can help, maybe we can help her.
1869880	1870720	Now that the mission's over.
1870720	1871640	Maybe we have to eliminate her.
1871640	1872800	Kill Ruth?
1872800	1874480	She basically said it herself.
1874480	1876960	This wasn't a mission, it's something she gave us.
1876960	1880080	But she's the handler, the guys, the lizard people,
1880080	1882040	whoever give it to her. Who handles the handler.
1882040	1884840	I never asked and I never really cared.
1884840	1886120	I think we take the body to her,
1886120	1887960	we find out she probably knows about the numbers.
1887960	1891120	What if enabling her enables something much worse?
1891120	1893760	I'm not here to discern that.
1893760	1894840	I'm here to do a job.
1894840	1898040	Then we have to rethink this whole parenthood situation.
1898040	1899400	What do you think, Shelly?
1899400	1902360	Shelly's been kinda staring down in the hole at the body
1902360	1904840	and he wants to jump down into the hole.
1904840	1905680	Can you do that?
1905680	1906520	Yeah.
1906920	1907760	Look in the ear,
1907760	1909120	cause he stuck his finger in his ear
1909120	1910000	and then into his mouth.
1910000	1912520	I wanna see if he got anything out of there.
1912520	1915520	You smell it first when you kinda get down close
1915520	1917520	to look inside.
1917520	1921840	It's like a salty, horrible earwax smell
1921840	1925680	mixed with like the ocean,
1925680	1927520	mixed with like an earthy.
1927520	1929520	Is it perhaps fungus-like?
1929520	1933160	I mean, when something earthy
1933160	1936640	is like mixed with the wet and the saline
1936640	1937480	for long enough.
1937480	1939920	Those are the conditions there, too.
1939920	1944840	It's almost as if something might be growing.
1945720	1948720	Comrades, down here please for your attention.
1948720	1953720	There seems to be a growth of sorts in Hargrave's ear.
1954200	1957440	I believe I found the aforementioned fungus
1957440	1958560	that one gets lost in.
1958560	1960120	Is it in his fucking brain?
1960120	1961280	Be very careful, doctor.
1961280	1962960	I can't tell how deep it goes,
1963640	1965600	but it does look as though it's cultivated here.
1965600	1967000	Can you get a sample?
1967000	1969160	I will attempt to do so now.
1971200	1972080	Do I need to roll?
1972080	1972920	No.
1972920	1974400	I think he pulls just a pin out of his pocket.
1974400	1975360	No, just touch it.
1976720	1978240	Yeah, just touch it, you fucking idiot.
1978240	1979560	Use the little puppet hands.
1979560	1980960	They'll fit right in there.
1982080	1983400	I whip out Craig Mile.
1984400	1987680	Craig Mile, I know this isn't your normal job.
1987680	1988680	I need you now.
1989560	1991600	You put a little lab coat and goggles on.
1993920	1996320	Tiny little rubber gloves on the ends.
1996320	1998760	And he maneuvers Craig Mile's hand in there
1998760	2001400	and makes it do a perfect scooping motion.
2004560	2006320	And pulls it out.
2006320	2009840	And then he grabs a sandwich bag that he always has on him
2009840	2010800	from after lunch.
2010800	2012280	Yeah, of course.
2012280	2014360	And scoops it into the bag.
2014360	2016840	After lunch is my favorite of the before trilogy.
2018560	2022200	Can we do a little experiment with that?
2022240	2023080	What do you think?
2023080	2023920	Hey, Rowan.
2024920	2029920	Rowan looks up at you, bags so deep under the eyes,
2030560	2033320	falling even heavier, seemingly,
2033320	2036120	as these dead eyes look at you.
2036120	2037960	It's time for a snack.
2037960	2039800	I pass the bag up to Meat Hook here.
2039800	2040640	Are you hungry?
2040640	2041460	Yeah.
2041460	2042300	There you go, Meat Hook.
2042300	2044280	I do believe it is time for science.
2044280	2045120	Okay.
2045120	2047200	Shelly's also starting to get out of the hole
2047200	2050320	and on his way out, he spits on the body of Hargrave.
2050320	2053520	He steps on his nose.
2056320	2058360	I'm gonna, when you're picking up dog poop
2058360	2060720	and you put your hand on the outside of the plastic bag,
2060720	2063440	but don't touch what's inside, but reversed.
2064760	2068720	And I'm gonna put just a little bit into his mouth.
2068720	2069560	Okay.
2072080	2072920	Hey, Becca.
2074460	2075300	Thanks.
2080680	2082280	Meat Hook is the closest
2087640	2092340	to Rowan when this happens.
2093200	2097040	And as the substance that was in the ear
2097040	2101040	of Dr. Brock Hargrave touches the mouth
2101040	2106040	and goes into the esophagus of Rowan Fitzpatrick.
2106640	2109680	Meat Hook, you are overcome with a need,
2109720	2114720	a feverish, rabid desire to get in the belly
2115880	2120240	of Rowan Fitzpatrick by any means necessary.
2120240	2124880	I need you to roll power at a negative 40
2124880	2126120	to fight against this.
2126120	2128280	Oof, get in my belly.
2128280	2133120	Yeah, I'm gonna get in that belly.
2133120	2134320	Kid, don't do it.
2134320	2135520	What are you talking about?
2135520	2136360	I'm gonna get in.
2136360	2137200	It's my creep now.
2137200	2138040	It is really.
2138040	2141080	My dads highly advise you against getting in that belly.
2141080	2144640	Okay, so I rolled a 35.
2144640	2146960	My power is a 60.
2147860	2150320	But you needed me to roll a 20 or below.
2150320	2151160	I did.
2151160	2153000	Oh, man.
2153000	2156080	So I just start digging in that belly button
2157960	2162480	to make a little spot, a little basement nest,
2162480	2164480	if you will, for a rat curl.
2164480	2166040	I can't lose another daughter.
2166040	2167840	We've got a basement nest for you here.
2168520	2169360	Basement creep now.
2169360	2172120	Remember how repulsed you were by this person earlier.
2172120	2175240	So we are going to go into combat order here,
2175240	2177700	which is in order of dexterity.
2177700	2179640	So call out your dexterity, please.
2179640	2180480	70.
2180480	2181320	50.
2181320	2182140	50.
2182140	2182980	65.
2182980	2185400	Okay, so it's gonna start with Meat Hook,
2185400	2188160	go to Vincenty, and then because we're already
2188160	2190280	going that way, we'll go Shelly and then Jimmy.
2190280	2193040	And with that, Meat Hook,
2194000	2195760	you are fighting tooth and nail
2195760	2199920	to get inside Rowan Fitzpatrick.
2199920	2201520	Hell yes, I am.
2201520	2204080	This is the answer I've been waiting for all my life.
2204080	2206200	Who would have ever thought Rowan Fitzpatrick
2206200	2207280	would hold it?
2207280	2210680	But now I need to know what's in there.
2211920	2214240	And I just try and rip it open.
2214240	2218680	Yeah, and because you did the syringe, there's no contest.
2218680	2220480	So if you succeed, you succeed.
2220480	2224760	I rolled a 77 and I needed a 50, so that's a crit fail.
2224760	2225760	Oh, shit.
2226880	2229040	So is that, that might be good for us.
2229040	2229860	I don't know.
2231360	2233120	That depends on your goal.
2233120	2235220	It definitely depends on your goal.
2235220	2239400	With a critical failure, as you are desperately
2239400	2244400	trying to crawl into the stomach area of Rowan Fitzpatrick,
2244680	2248000	you slip and one of, your hand reaches out
2248000	2250840	and just goes directly soft through,
2250840	2253960	like you're putting your hand into a bowl of jello,
2253960	2257600	just like into the middle of Rowan Fitzpatrick.
2257600	2261000	And you hold on, and I need you to roll a grip
2261000	2265780	as you hold on to this weird kind of like bouncy,
2265780	2268920	synthetic feeling substance on the other side.
2268920	2271240	Zach is in grip to me in grip.
2271240	2273120	88 would be a crit fail.
2273120	2277880	Holy shit, wow.
2279000	2281640	All right, okay.
2281640	2283600	So two crit fails in a row.
2285880	2287040	No.
2287040	2288760	Oh, that means you get slimed.
2291760	2293080	Click the button.
2293080	2294040	It's not working.
2296760	2301760	So I need you to, well, I was gonna have you roll a D8
2302640	2307080	and add one for your grip loss, but when you crit fail,
2307080	2309360	you just take the maximum.
2309360	2310560	So that's nine.
2310560	2311480	Okay.
2311480	2314280	So you lose nine grip in one fell swoop,
2314280	2318280	which means that you are on a temporary loss
2318280	2320120	of yourself from reality.
2320120	2322320	We weren't there already?
2322320	2323160	Okay.
2325200	2327840	I just start humming Mamma Mia.
2327920	2330920	And is it because you have three dads now?
2330920	2331760	Yeah, exactly.
2331760	2332680	Yes, exactly.
2336680	2337520	Genius.
2339320	2342920	You feel a hand reach out and grab your wrist.
2342920	2343760	Holy shit.
2344760	2347800	Oh, my friend, you found me.
2347800	2349640	Brandon, I'm coming.
2349640	2350480	I'm coming.
2350480	2351320	I'm coming.
2351320	2352160	I'm coming.
2352160	2353000	I'm coming.
2353000	2353840	I'm coming.
2353840	2354680	I'm coming.
2354680	2355520	I'm coming.
2355520	2356360	I'm coming.
2356520	2358440	Brandon, I'm coming.
2359920	2362920	And now it is the turn of Vincenty Bory.
2362920	2367920	You've got Meat Hook up to one elbow in Rowan Fitzpatrick,
2368440	2370200	a normal role-playing sentence.
2372920	2376080	Vincenty's thinking when Hargrave died,
2376080	2379280	his portal belly went away.
2379280	2381200	She's how far in?
2381200	2382040	Just an arm?
2382040	2383080	Elbow, yep, single elbow.
2383080	2385480	Meat Hook, I'm so fucking sorry.
2385480	2387520	And I pull my revolver out
2387520	2391120	and I want to shoot Rowan in the face.
2391120	2392120	You have good firearms?
2392120	2393320	I got good firearms.
2395040	2395880	Okay.
2395880	2396720	What?
2396720	2397560	Strong choice.
2397560	2399560	Go ahead and roll firearms.
2402560	2405080	I do not pass my firearms.
2405080	2406640	85 on a 50.
2406640	2408840	You didn't have good firearms.
2408840	2410480	50's like I went to college
2410480	2413040	and got a doctorate in firearms.
2413040	2413880	No.
2416960	2417800	According to the rules.
2417800	2419000	I think according to the rule book,
2419000	2422600	a 50 would be above a college degree in something.
2422600	2423680	It's firearms.
2423680	2426360	I forgot to load my fucking revolver
2427720	2431560	in this particular chamber.
2431560	2434400	That's an out that doesn't kill Meat Hook.
2434400	2435400	And your turn's over.
2435400	2437360	And we move on to Shelly Seamblithe.
2437360	2440200	Shelly sees that Meat Hook is going in
2440200	2442240	so he wants to grab a leg.
2442280	2443720	He's pulling back the other way.
2443720	2444560	Tug of war.
2444560	2445400	Yep, tug of war time.
2445400	2447080	That's a way more logical move.
2449280	2450680	As you roll strength.
2450680	2453120	My basement creep, you're coming with us.
2454000	2455000	I rolled an eight.
2455000	2458280	Oh, that is good if it wasn't in a contest.
2458280	2459840	Yep, hold on.
2460880	2461760	Yeah, I did that math right.
2461760	2464480	Okay, I've got an 80 firearms and an 85 strength.
2464480	2465720	So I'm going to join Shelly.
2465720	2467440	I was going to say, I just passed with a 24.
2467440	2470800	So you can add your success onto the eight
2470800	2472960	to try to beat a 24.
2472960	2473960	It's a 96.
2473960	2475000	Oh no.
2475000	2477640	Doesn't an eight beat a 24?
2477640	2478480	It's got to be.
2478480	2479480	Not in a contest.
2479480	2480480	Yeah, if it's a contest,
2480480	2483760	you have to roll higher under the score.
2483760	2485160	The worst critical thing.
2485160	2486440	Higher under?
2486440	2488120	Your rules are nutty.
2488120	2488960	It's blackjack rules.
2488960	2490240	That's what Thomas keeps saying.
2490240	2492120	Yeah, I don't like them either.
2492120	2494680	But they're not our rules.
2494680	2496200	Because you're telling the dice to roll low.
2496200	2497840	You know, you can't tell the dice two things.
2497840	2498680	I know, exactly.
2498680	2500760	You got to tell the dice to roll as high as possible
2501600	2502440	while still being a success.
2502440	2506080	But it makes sense because if you have a higher level skill,
2506080	2509760	you can roll a higher number and still win.
2509760	2511320	Yeah, but it feels weird.
2512920	2513760	You're not wrong.
2513760	2516880	I've been on Zach's side this whole time.
2516880	2519040	But holy shit, that's not good.
2519040	2521760	So yeah, Thomas did the crit-est of crit fails
2521760	2522600	in our own rules.
2522600	2524040	Yeah, I didn't roll a 69.
2524040	2527560	I rolled a 96 trying to pull you out with.
2527560	2528760	Not nice.
2528760	2530120	That's like two angry people
2530120	2531640	that don't even want to look at each other.
2531640	2533920	Yeah, they're not pleasuring each other orally.
2533920	2536720	They're farting on each other with their backs turned.
2537640	2539680	Yeah, they're sleeping in fetal positions
2539680	2540920	in opposite directions.
2540920	2541940	One's upside down.
2543600	2545640	Angry in it, opposite end of the bed.
2547240	2548720	Meat Hook is gonna-
2548720	2549680	I'm gonna turn my back to you.
2549680	2554680	Grab onto this hand that she found inside the belly.
2554920	2557040	I kind of want to try and pull the hand out,
2557080	2561120	but I'm wondering if the need to go inside the belly
2561120	2562480	has changed at all.
2562480	2565680	Or if my crit fail means I'm just jumping on it.
2565680	2568080	I love the pulling at the hand.
2568080	2569200	Yeah, that's fun.
2569200	2570640	Hold on, what's in here?
2570640	2573680	What grip did you have and what was your breaking point?
2573680	2574520	Oh.
2574520	2575340	I'm not at the breaking point yet.
2575340	2577280	That's right, but you rolled over five.
2577280	2579120	So we're gonna actually go-
2579120	2581360	I'm sorry, I completely missed that.
2581360	2582200	Basically at this point what we do-
2582200	2583840	I'll be the DM for a minute.
2583840	2584880	Thank you.
2584880	2587560	At this point, we roll a D6
2587560	2592480	and we put in order fight, flight, or freeze.
2592480	2595240	And so if you think that Meat Hook
2595240	2597240	would be most likely to fight,
2597240	2601400	you put that at the top and that would be four, five, and six.
2601400	2603840	You text flight to fight to four, five, six.
2603840	2605080	Four, two, oh, six, nine, six, nine.
2605080	2606560	And if you think it's second-
2606560	2608200	Wait, no, it only gets two numbers.
2608200	2609040	Five and six.
2609040	2611360	And then the second most likely that you think
2611360	2614280	if you roll a two or a three,
2614720	2615560	then you do that one.
2615560	2617480	And then the last one that you think is the least likely
2617480	2618320	is just a one.
2618320	2621720	You mean given my insanity what's most and least likely?
2621720	2622560	That is correct.
2622560	2625000	Okay, well flight means crawling in this belly.
2625000	2626720	So that's the most likely.
2626720	2627560	Okay.
2627560	2630920	Fight is probably her natural inclination.
2630920	2632000	So that's next.
2632000	2634640	And then freeze, yeah, that's the least likely.
2634640	2636520	Okay, that's perfect.
2636520	2638040	Oh no. It's a five.
2638040	2639840	Five is flight.
2639840	2641280	We jump on it.
2641280	2644360	I take the hand and I let the hand pull me
2644360	2646520	as I just relax my body.
2648400	2649240	Yeah.
2649240	2652840	You all see Meat Hook fully engulfed
2652840	2655880	by the midriff of Rowan Fitzpatrick.
2655880	2657520	I need you all to roll grip.
2657520	2658760	Completely inside?
2658760	2662680	As she disappears from view entirely.
2662680	2665080	You see a steel-tipped boot
2665080	2670080	with a lot of extra studs and spikes stuck out of it.
2670400	2673200	Kind of get caught on the edge of the skull buckle
2673200	2674560	and then before going in.
2676280	2681160	I am not okay with seeing our new adoptive child
2681160	2683200	sucked up into that man's belly.
2683200	2684600	This is fish face all over again.
2684600	2685440	Did I mention I'm 27?
2685440	2686400	It's okay though.
2687600	2688440	I failed.
2689720	2690960	How old were you when your parents
2690960	2693760	dropped you off at the place?
2693760	2694800	Seven.
2694800	2695640	Oh, okay.
2695640	2696880	20 years in the hole.
2696880	2699120	So that's where I'm stuck mentally, you know?
2700120	2702960	So then fish face is still very problematic.
2702960	2703800	Oh yeah.
2703800	2704640	Oh yeah.
2704640	2706000	Well, no one ever debated that.
2708800	2710280	Joe, how did Shelly St. Blythe do that?
2710280	2711360	I passed.
2711360	2713440	Okay, so the single pass here on the grip.
2713440	2717440	You only lose one with the disappearance of Meat Hook.
2717440	2721920	The other two of you, I need you to roll a D6 and add one.
2721920	2724720	So when, fuck.
2724720	2727200	That's an eight for me.
2727200	2728840	Puts me past, well past my breaking point.
2728840	2730960	How could it be A is D6 plus one?
2730960	2731960	You said plus two, I thought.
2731960	2733000	Oh, sure.
2733000	2734080	He did not.
2734080	2737160	Oh, well a seven still puts me past my breaking point.
2737160	2739360	And a temporary grip loss.
2739360	2740680	Teacher, didn't we have a quiz?
2740680	2742560	No, I never fucking said we had a quiz.
2743960	2746440	When Corrigan failed his, Extreme failed
2746440	2748980	his strength check, I think he fell backwards
2748980	2749820	and it knocked me off.
2749820	2752640	I was gonna say, yeah, we didn't ever resolve that.
2752640	2754680	Cause I was still holding on to her leg,
2754680	2756880	but we'll say that I am not now.
2756880	2758120	No, you definitely fell back.
2758600	2760760	Along with the critical failure there.
2760760	2763520	I lost four grip, but I'm still well above
2763520	2764360	my breaking point.
2764360	2766020	Okay, and with four, you don't need to fight
2766020	2768460	flight or freeze, however.
2768460	2771340	I'm going fight, fight, freeze.
2771340	2772680	You said D6 plus one?
2772680	2773500	Yes, I did.
2773500	2774340	So I lost five.
2774340	2775860	And you're gonna do the same.
2775860	2776700	Freeze.
2776700	2777520	Freeze.
2777520	2781240	Fincenzi Bori freezes in his tracks, unable to move.
2781240	2782440	Lost in thought.
2782440	2785640	Jimmy Corrigan fights, he fucking thrusts
2785640	2788640	both arms into the belly of Rowan.
2788640	2793100	And as you do so, I need you to roll a D4 minus one
2793100	2793940	for damage.
2795680	2796800	That made a cool noise.
2796800	2797640	Two.
2797640	2799140	Two minus one?
2799140	2800120	Two minus one is one?
2800120	2800960	No, no, no.
2802720	2805080	And so with a two hit point loss,
2805080	2808200	you just punch with both fists into the stomach.
2808200	2810360	The abs you feel just like, oh,
2810360	2813680	you get a slight response out of Rowan for the first time.
2813680	2818080	And then it's just, and then just continues
2818080	2820120	to just dead eyes look at the ground.
2820120	2821180	Where's that ear fungus?
2821180	2823220	Give me that fucking ear fungus.
2823220	2825800	Is the bag that had the fungus lying anywhere?
2825800	2828240	That would be on the ground.
2828240	2830040	I'll use my luck to have dropped it.
2830040	2831880	Yeah, no, I think you could have dropped it.
2831880	2833160	I like that, I like that.
2833160	2834560	We'll let it ride.
2834560	2836480	So you've dropped it on the ground there,
2836480	2841200	but I actually at this point need a roll.
2841200	2844800	I need a con roll from Meat Hook.
2844800	2845640	Oh.
2848160	2850840	Oh, pass, 49 under 50.
2850840	2854120	What wonders is she going to see in there?
2854120	2857460	You're not sure about anything that's been happening
2857460	2860720	so far, Jimmy Corrigan, but you do know that
2860720	2864400	when you punch the stomach of Rowan Fitzpatrick,
2864400	2869400	they explode like in half.
2869480	2871920	Exactly where you punch, just like right at the midriff,
2871920	2874760	exactly where Meat Hook just went in.
2874760	2878400	They just, something like as if the building
2878400	2881800	was being dropped, but all the detonation spots
2881800	2883800	were like halfway through.
2883800	2886440	It just boom, and then the top half just kind of falls
2886440	2890240	a little bit, slump, slop on slop, human inside
2890240	2891560	on human inside.
2893200	2895660	And the top half falls, and then the knees fall,
2895660	2898680	just like when you shot people in the dick in GoldenEye.
2898680	2900320	Do I need to roll a grip for that?
2900320	2901160	Yeah.
2902200	2903520	Uh, that's a fail.
2903520	2906800	I need grip checks from the other two of you as well.
2906800	2908160	Jesus.
2908160	2909220	I pass.
2909220	2911520	One grip loss with a pass.
2911520	2915120	I'm going to death of a thousand cuts, lose my mind.
2915120	2917720	Again, 1d4 plus one.
2917720	2919320	I crit failed.
2919320	2920720	That's five again.
2920720	2921560	Awesome.
2922860	2924280	I also, five.
2925640	2926480	Jesus.
2929680	2931840	Absolutely meltdown.
2931840	2934320	So what Jimmy Corrigan does is-
2934320	2936360	I hit a breaking point again.
2936360	2938960	He grabs the syringe of ketamine,
2938960	2941760	and he's going to try to inject it into the nearest person.
2941760	2944800	Okay, let's roll and see who the nearest person is.
2944800	2948360	It is just three other people standing here now.
2948360	2952960	It is Vincenzi Bori, Shelly St. Blythe, and-
2952960	2953800	Brandy.
2953800	2954620	Brandy.
2954620	2955600	Oh, Brandy's still here?
2956600	2957840	What the fuck?
2958880	2959720	Oh my God.
2960880	2962600	I thought we were going to have to kill one of the dads
2962600	2964840	to save the child, but unfortunately I-
2964840	2967000	She runs off into the woods.
2967000	2969440	I athletics, I run after her.
2969440	2972080	As you tackle her into the ground
2972080	2973440	and you're doing what now?
2973440	2975200	Injecting that ketamine.
2975200	2976020	Yep.
2976020	2979080	You do so, and she like almost immediately
2979080	2981480	just like falls unconscious.
2981480	2982320	It's okay.
2982320	2984880	Where you're going is probably a better place.
2984880	2985760	We're not going to punch you.
2985760	2987020	We're not going to make you explode,
2987020	2988520	but we got to get our daughter back.
2988520	2991240	And well, you know, sorry.
2991240	2995460	And he walks back to the ear fungus and eats a little bit.
2995460	2996300	Wait.
2996300	2997120	Well, before he does that, he-
2997120	2997960	Too late.
2997960	2998800	Oh my God.
2998800	2999620	He said it.
2999620	3000460	He just fucking said it.
3000460	3001280	He said it.
3001280	3002120	Well, wait a minute.
3002120	3004920	I mean, one of us has to eat some to get in there, right?
3004920	3005760	We can't-
3005760	3006580	No.
3006580	3007420	You think we can feed it to her?
3007420	3008780	If it goes in her mouth.
3008780	3010640	Have we seen anybody open a portal?
3010640	3011480	Oh, we did.
3011480	3012320	That's what this whole thing is.
3012320	3013400	That's what just happened.
3013400	3014740	Well, I'm insane.
3015640	3016800	I feel like once you say a thing,
3016800	3018360	the thing can't be unsaid.
3019440	3020280	He walks away from her.
3020280	3025080	He kind of eats her and then eats the whole thing himself.
3025080	3026640	I thought that's how it worked.
3026640	3029720	I mean, that is what Dr. Brock Hargrave did.
3029720	3031200	Exactly.
3031200	3033280	So if your goal is to open yourself up,
3033280	3035440	perhaps that would be the way of doing it.
3036880	3037720	Yeah.
3037720	3039440	He eats it and he says,
3039440	3041620	save our baby girl.
3041620	3042880	And he looks at you too.
3044240	3045720	That doesn't make sense, does it?
3045720	3048320	Should we just rerecord me feeding it to her?
3048320	3049280	That's why it's funny.
3049280	3050400	I think it makes sense
3050400	3052640	because you don't have all your wits about you.
3052640	3054680	Yeah, I think it absolutely makes sense
3054680	3056400	that you're walking back to them
3056400	3058360	as you put it in your mouth.
3059320	3061840	Vincenty also does not have his wits about him.
3061840	3062660	With that-
3062660	3065720	I give you the ketamine, I take the earwax.
3065720	3067640	And I need a power roll at a negative 40
3067640	3069480	from Vincenty Bory.
3069480	3072060	I've got a pretty good chance here.
3072060	3073260	A 20 on a five.
3077740	3079620	It's like a primal urge.
3079620	3082240	It's like a hunger deep within you.
3082240	3086500	You feel just like completely drawn without hesitation.
3086500	3089580	Vincenty gets in like the-
3089580	3090420	Let me be clear,
3090420	3092660	to crawl into the stomach of Jimmy Corrigan
3092660	3094260	is what you feel like doing.
3094260	3097000	Vincenty gets in position like you would
3097000	3099160	at the beginning of a track race.
3102620	3105220	And takes off sprinting
3105220	3109220	and is gonna try to just dive head first into the stomach.
3112820	3115260	Jimmy Corrigan, how are you responding to this?
3115260	3117660	I like make myself a bigger target
3117660	3120620	and I say, you go get our girl.
3120620	3122180	Holy shit.
3125060	3128180	Oh yeah, I need a con check from Jimmy Corrigan.
3128180	3129660	Like a really important one.
3133060	3134180	Pass.
3135300	3136860	That's good.
3136860	3138620	Vincenty takes off
3138620	3141200	and as his feet leave the ground
3141200	3143340	and his head is heading towards the stomach,
3143340	3145480	he just says, I'm not real anyway,
3145480	3147100	so it don't fucking matter.
3147100	3147940	I'm coming.
3149020	3151980	And through the torso of Jimmy Corrigan,
3151980	3154700	Vincenty Bory just disappears.
3154700	3159700	I'm pulling that out
3160700	3162660	and using it for all the previous ones.
3164580	3165420	You're welcome.
3166460	3170540	Jimmy Corrigan, you are completely gripless.
3170540	3171360	In Seattle.
3173100	3174260	Should I say Blythe?
3174260	3175340	We are at the Space Needle.
3175340	3176940	Go ahead and roll a grip for me.
3179260	3180420	Hey, I passed that one.
3180420	3183020	Okay, so you just lose one again.
3183100	3184820	It's all good here.
3184820	3186340	I'm just nodding enthusiastically.
3186340	3191180	I'm like, Shelley, we're gonna get our daughter back.
3198780	3200580	I need to know what the two of you
3200580	3202860	who have just left yourselves alone.
3202860	3206820	There is one dead body in a hole in the ground
3206820	3209360	that is like not covered up.
3209360	3214360	There is a exploded kid on the ground halved
3215960	3220500	and then there's an unconscious woman off to the side
3220500	3223360	down the path heading back to the parking lot
3223360	3226160	and the two of you are just looking at each other.
3226160	3227100	How does it feel?
3227100	3230440	I mean, a little jiggly, I guess.
3230440	3232520	I really thought stabbing her with ketamine
3232520	3234480	would do something else.
3234480	3235320	Oh, I could tell.
3235320	3237600	I thought maybe you got mixed up on who was who.
3237600	3239080	I got mixed up, I got mixed up.
3239680	3240960	I thought she was one of the dads.
3240960	3241880	I understand.
3241880	3243600	Luke and Joe, could you guys take off
3243600	3244640	your headphones real quick?
3244640	3245660	Yeah.
3245660	3250400	Hey, Thomas, Jimmy's never felt anything like that ever
3250400	3254600	and it was like the coolest, best feeling
3254600	3255900	that you've ever had.
3256920	3257800	Oh no.
3257800	3259200	I'm just saying.
3259200	3261540	Okay, yeah.
3261540	3262840	Should we bird him?
3262840	3264120	Yeah, they can be birded.
3264120	3264960	Love the bird.
3266040	3267700	Wait, unbird, I'm sorry.
3269800	3270640	D-bird.
3270640	3271480	D-bird, D-bird.
3271480	3272580	D-bird, D-bird, D-bird.
3272580	3276040	If I eat more, he will want to come into my belly.
3276040	3277880	Oh, you've lost enough grip now.
3277880	3280440	Yeah, you're pretty sure how this works now.
3280440	3283000	So basically when you eat the substance,
3283000	3286440	the person closest to you seemingly
3286440	3288260	wants to get in your belly.
3288260	3289320	Okay, okay, okay.
3289320	3291720	So yeah, bird, bird.
3291720	3293360	That's not the bird.
3293360	3296000	I'm doing it quickly and I have dice in my hands.
3296960	3299080	I wonder why he just went thumbs like that.
3301080	3302960	Shelley, how does it feel?
3302960	3305560	It feels fantastic to be a family.
3306860	3310840	And you notice he's starting to like nibble
3310840	3313040	a little bit more out of the plastic bag.
3313040	3315100	It's time that you joined us.
3316360	3319800	Joe, just looking at Zach like, help me.
3319800	3322400	I've never seen such a help me look ever.
3322400	3325520	I didn't know if my sanity loss makes me want to do this.
3325880	3326840	I think with the passing,
3326840	3330000	I'm going to let you keep your wits about you enough.
3330000	3332320	But I mean, obviously this is chipping away
3332320	3334480	your ability to sense reality.
3334480	3335660	Okay, I eat a little more.
3335660	3338000	No, I'm not hungry, sorry.
3338000	3340920	No, no, Shelley, you don't have to eat any.
3340920	3342520	But aren't you hungry for family?
3342520	3345300	I mean, I miss Meat Hook, of course.
3345300	3348240	And Chedi, I didn't know him terribly well,
3348240	3350040	but he seemed nice.
3350040	3353640	But no, I don't want to go inside of you to find them.
3353680	3355640	That's where our little basement troll is.
3355640	3358480	They haven't returned and I don't know if I will return.
3358480	3361040	I firmly placed my hands on his shoulders.
3361040	3362200	You want to get in there.
3362200	3365760	I don't want to get inside of you, Jimmy.
3366760	3369440	It's so cool in here, doctor.
3370800	3372360	My belly button like whistles.
3374680	3377480	But also you just hear that in your head.
3377480	3379080	She's calling for you, doc.
3379080	3380880	That's the real Bigfoot.
3380880	3383440	Basement creep, basement creep, is that you?
3383440	3384800	It's me.
3384800	3389280	They've got so many types of rocks in here.
3389280	3390400	Rocks.
3390400	3391240	There's a lot of rocks in here, doc.
3391240	3394800	Igneous, the, limestone.
3394800	3395800	Limestone.
3395800	3397480	I mean, it's your head telling you this,
3397480	3401080	so it's rattling off all the rocks that you love most.
3401080	3402520	Igneous, limestone.
3402520	3403360	The.
3406640	3409760	Stand back, cannon ball.
3409760	3414760	So, yeah.
3418520	3420520	Jimmy opens his arm wide again
3420520	3423280	and just like has a huge grin on his face.
3423280	3426040	And it's almost like he's reaching for like an embrace,
3426040	3429000	but he's just inviting you to jump in.
3429000	3431200	I get a running start and go in feet first.
3432120	3433360	Knees tucked to chest.
3437040	3439080	I don't have to roll for you.
3439240	3442240	You do have to roll a constitution.
3442240	3443520	Oh, I know that look.
3443520	3446440	That's the look of deciding whether or not he wants to lie.
3450280	3451880	It is.
3451880	3453880	It's just, I have a cool thing to do.
3453880	3455120	You better do it quick.
3456000	3457760	Would have failed, Gibby.
3457760	3462760	You, as Shelley St. Blythe dives feet first,
3469160	3471320	like he's going down a water slide
3471320	3475440	at fucking Splashylvania, two fanged plunge in there.
3475440	3477840	You look down at the ground
3477840	3482840	and see the split in half body of Rowan Fitzpatrick.
3483160	3485400	And you feel like,
3485400	3487600	hmm, what happened to Rowan
3487600	3489320	is gonna happen to you any second now.
3489320	3490200	You can feel it.
3490200	3492200	What do you do with your last thoughts?
3492200	3493280	Get inside your own stomach.
3493280	3494120	Shut up, Luke.
3494120	3494960	That's my whole deal.
3498440	3499840	I get inside my own stomach.
3506280	3508000	Knowing I'm a ticking time bomb,
3508000	3512000	I watched like the last long white hair
3512000	3513880	breezing by of Shelley get in me.
3513880	3516240	And I just try to shove my head in there after him.
3516240	3519440	As you get your head close, you feel like.
3519440	3521960	While munching on some fungus.
3523840	3526920	You shove the last little bit of it into your mouth,
3526920	3531080	shove your face and hands into your own stomach.
3531080	3533800	It just falls away.
3533800	3536920	And just so you feel this like warm wetness.
3536920	3539920	It's like, you smell saline in the air
3539920	3542200	and you hear this like weird noise
3542200	3544400	as your hands go through
3544400	3547440	and you feel the grip of friends hands,
3547440	3551000	family's hands on the other side, pulling you through.
3551000	3552840	You made it.
3552840	3554360	It's like in the labyrinth
3554360	3556680	when she goes down the tunnel.
3560680	3564520	Just as I'm ecstatic about those hands on mine,
3565600	3569200	I remember my wife and children.
3569920	3573400	We're your family now.
3573400	3577400	Yeah, my family's in me.
3580400	3583720	The four of you on the other side
3583720	3588160	of Jimmy Corrigan's unnatural stomach.
3589560	3590680	Plus Brandon.
3590680	3591520	Right?
3591520	3593000	Plus Brandon.
3593000	3593840	Oh, hey.
3593840	3596200	And the coworker.
3597880	3599320	Co-workers nowhere to be seen,
3599560	3600400	but you're all-
3600400	3602560	Further on in the territory.
3602560	3604560	Looking at a sprawling town park
3604560	3608120	straight out of the 1950s idea of the future.
3608120	3610080	Perfectly manicured trees
3610080	3612480	like enormous emerald cake pops line,
3612480	3615440	a colorful synthetic walkway
3615440	3617280	that you've been pulled up onto
3617280	3620360	in this slightly bouncy, comfortable sidewalk
3620360	3622080	would take you all the way around
3622080	3624760	this gigantic green area around you
3624760	3626880	where on the far side,
3626880	3631880	maybe, I don't know, 124.3 meters away or so,
3632600	3636840	people in yellow and green uniforms are running around
3636840	3639640	and all the way across this park.
3639640	3642040	So monumental, they are clear from here.
3642040	3644560	There are two statues of men,
3644560	3647440	each about 26.3 meters tall,
3647440	3648880	made of green rock.
3648880	3650240	Yeah, dude.
3650240	3652400	They stand in front of a gorgeous building
3652400	3655120	seemingly made of glass and grass
3655120	3657280	and a woman in judge's robes
3657280	3660440	and a powdered wig wearing electric blue heels
3660440	3661960	looks at you and says,
3661960	3665360	or very quickly we need to get you inside and hidden.
3665360	3668840	Quick, everyone, before anyone sees.
3668840	3672360	And that is the end of Holy Cow Farms.
3672360	3673320	Thank you so much.
3673320	3676240	Holy, holy shit.
3676960	3677800	Okay.
3677800	3678640	Yeah.
3678640	3679480	First you tell Becca what happened.
3679480	3681320	Oh my, I knew it.
3681320	3682160	Yeah.
3682160	3683000	Oh my gosh.
3683000	3683840	Yeah.
3683840	3685680	I just want to go to this place.
3685680	3689120	That's a place that's in another part of our podcast.
3689120	3691360	This is the easiest way to say all that.
3691360	3693240	It's very nice here.
3693240	3695680	Yeah, it seems that way, huh?
3695680	3696520	It's growing.
3696520	3697360	It's growing.
3697360	3698200	It's growing.
3698200	3699040	It's growing.
3699040	3699880	It's growing.
3699880	3700720	It's growing.
3700720	3701560	It's growing.
3701560	3702400	It's growing.
3702400	3703240	It's growing.
3703240	3704080	It's growing.
3704080	3704920	It's growing.
3704920	3705760	It's growing.
3706120	3708480	It's Grover's Gorge, which is like,
3708480	3709320	Oh!
3711960	3714080	Which is like if Walmart had a city
3714080	3715760	that all its employees lived in.
3715760	3717800	Oh yeah, actually they do have one of those
3717800	3720400	and they've got some pretty good concerts.
3720400	3721480	Yeah.
3721480	3723160	Oh shit.
3723160	3726680	Becca, Scott, thank you so much for coming on
3726680	3729760	and joining us for this four episode run
3729760	3730600	here in season two.

3731880	3733200	But also this was so much fun.
3733200	3734040	The series.
3734040	3734880	Such a blast to play with you.
3734880	3735720	Aw.
3736720	3738360	Thomas, Joe, Luke.
3738360	3739200	Nailed it.
3739200	3740040	Thank you for having me.
3740040	3741880	Oh, we're in the mind palace now.
3741880	3745240	And also the MVP was Dylan.
3745240	3746080	Absolutely.
3746080	3746920	The straight ass dude.
3746920	3747760	Do it.
3747760	3748600	Shout out to him.
3748600	3750160	Zeitgeist is so cool.
3750160	3751520	Zeitgeist, for the win.
3752520	3753360	For the win?
3753360	3754520	For the win, dude.
3755720	3756560	Epic.
3756560	3758520	I love some cosmic horror that ends up
3758520	3760760	in everybody dying and little explained.
3760760	3762840	That's my way to roll play.
3762840	3765640	So thank you so much for letting me be a part.
3766560	3767400	Yeah.
3767400	3770120	This was actually a fate worse than death, I think.
3771080	3771920	Which is fun.
3771920	3773520	Sometimes when a belly opens up,
3773520	3776840	you just need to either dive right in or cannonball.
3776840	3777680	Yeah.
3777680	3778520	Yeah.
3778520	3780080	Cannonball.
3780080	3784320	That's the only mystic advice my dad gave me about dating.
3784320	3785160	Oh yeah.
3786200	3788480	I've never used it, but I've wondered what it meant.
3788480	3789760	When I was in sixth grade,
3789760	3794120	my dad told me that you have to make the woman come first.
3794120	3795360	That was inappropriate for me.
3796360	3797200	Yeah, that's true.
3797200	3798920	Really sage advice.
3800920	3803160	But he's a Christian, so we don't listen to him.
3804760	3805600	Good job, dad.
3805600	3806440	All right.
3806440	3809560	And, Becca, do you want to give the people
3809560	3812040	like a shout out for where they can find you
3812040	3813040	on the internet?
3813040	3815040	Look into the cameras, tell the people
3815040	3816400	what you got going on.
3816400	3819360	Besides the show notes, which there will be a link
3819360	3821640	to your website and your Twitter account.
3821640	3823320	Or anything else you want.
3823320	3824320	Or whatever you want.
3824480	3826560	Look at them show notes.
3826560	3828800	There's a bunch of backlog of me running
3828800	3830760	Call of Cthulhu games on my YouTube channel,
3830760	3832200	Good Time Society.
3832200	3834440	You can find me on the internet at the Becca Scott.
3834440	3835280	So go do it.
3835280	3836120	Do it.
3836120	3837160	Absolutely do it.
3837160	3838280	I'm going to do it right now.
3838280	3839480	Go learn how to play a game
3839480	3842720	because she does the coolest tutorials on board games.
3842720	3843560	That's how I've learned how to play a game.
3843560	3845200	Thank you.
3845200	3846200	I do do that.
3846200	3849200	Joe was so fucking excited when I said Becca Scott
3849200	3850040	was going to be on.
3850040	3851000	I'm a big fan.
3851000	3853120	I'm a very big fan.
3853120	3853960	Doo doo.
3854440	3856240	Thank you so much for coming.
3856240	3858000	Yeah, and doo doo to you listeners.
3859240	3860080	Doo doo all around.
3860080	3861280	Doo doo unto you.
3861280	3862720	Oh my God.
3862720	3863560	Yeah, that was fucking tight.
3863560	3864400	Well thanks, Francis.
3864400	3865240	Thank you so much.
3865240	3866080	Thank you so much.
3866080	3866920	That was awesome.
3866920	3869560	I lost audio at 70 minutes.
3869560	3871080	No shit.
3871080	3873120	Are you for real?
3873120	3876160	How long was it supposed to be?
3876160	3879200	Oh, well I have an hour 17.
3879200	3881080	So you lost the last seven.
3881080	3882760	I think that was just some bullshit.
3882800	3886280	Yeah, and also I have a recording of us.
3886280	3887120	Through that, yeah.
3887120	3887960	Through OBS.
3887960	3888800	We'll be fine.
3888800	3890480	So we'll be fine.
3890480	3891320	Oh, thank God.
3891320	3892160	That was scary.
3892160	3893280	Did you write down?
3893280	3894880	Yeah, I wrote down everything.
3906880	3908120	I need a second.
3909640	3912200	You've got to run the calculations to see.
3912960	3914440	836.
3917200	3918920	Which Bible verse is that?
3919880	3920720	Oh, you don't know?
3920720	3921560	I know.
3921560	3924520	We're not a Christian podcast.
3924520	3928480	Thou shalt climb in the belly of your brethren
3928480	3932080	and be with him internally inside his own guts.
3932080	3933040	That sounds right, yeah.
3933040	3936360	Yeah, and also if your brother dies, you marry his wife.
3942200	3947200	If it's some consolation
3947200	3952200	It's a lie
3952200	3957200	It's a lie
3957200	3962200	It's a lie
3962200	3967200	It's a lie
3968200	3975200	If it's some consolation
3975200	3982200	I was thinking the same thing
3982200	3988200	I am now mechanization
3988200	3993200	All my muscles work like swings
3997200	4002200	All my muscles work like swings
4002200	4004200	It's like a primal urge.
4004200	4006200	It's like a hunger deep within you.
4006200	4009200	It's like a paranoia.
4009200	4010200	Looking over my back.
4010200	4012200	It's like a whirlwind.
4012200	4013200	It's Linkin Park.
4013200	4016200	And it's all my fault.
4027200	4029200	Thanks for watching!
