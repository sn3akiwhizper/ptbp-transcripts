0	15820	Hey y'all, just in case y'all forgot, it is indeed 26 years ago, and for some reason,
15820	22280	my voice can transmit to the past, from the present, and speaking of the present, y'all
22280	28600	know I am here to bestow my vocal gifts upon all of y'all, no matter the when.
28600	37440	Live from 694.2 PTBP, time traveling dogs named Wolf can be scary, but what is not scary
37440	45780	is howling with Wolf, a segment I am definitely not forced to do against my will by my amorphous
45780	52140	producer who may or may not possess ownership over my soul.
52140	58400	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from At Perfect Us Nemo, who tweeted about the show
58400	60700	and tagged at Pretending Pod.
60700	67500	They wanted to hear your boy Wolf vocalize the frustrations of the BBEG in their own
67500	68660	campaign.
68660	76660	They write, I am the ancient, I am the land, I was vain, and due to my hubris, I lost my
76660	77660	beloved.
77660	84200	When I let outsiders into my own home, I was met with trickery and recklessness, going
84200	89980	through my domain like a plague, destroying everything that was dear to me.
89980	95980	Let them rally the creatures in the valley, let them storm my castle, all they will achieve
95980	100540	is a long and painful prelude to an eternal march.
100540	105780	And I shall wait as long as it is necessary, for nothing is gone forever.
105780	110340	I will reclaim what is rightfully mine.
110340	118060	Well that was certainly very fun and light hearted and not at all super fucked up dark
118060	119060	and weird.
119060	125220	Thanks for writing in some very normal sounding stuff for your dumpster daddy to deliver.

226940	232300	Last time we met our new friends in the meeting room of calm comfy campgrounds and followed
232300	235260	along as they checked in for the weekend.
235260	242100	Walter Grimes a totally normal 16 year old boy and his father Alan are in cottage number

255860	262700	uptight newlywed is in cottage number 9 with his bohemian bride taking us back into the
262700	266740	corner free meeting room for orientation.
266740	271060	about edging it's dream girl with pretty sexual
296740	318300	stormy do you have any guns i need to shoot my friend he would definitely drive over here
318300	323660	with his pistol if i was like hey i need to shoot luke i love your dad and the thing is
323660	328980	you he would act like if you asked him to he would probably kill me oh i don't know
328980	333780	about that now he'd make me do my own dirty business yeah he would he would provide all
333780	341140	the materials son i don't want you to do this but uh the man who passes the judgment ought
341140	346480	to pull the trigger that's a good impression of your dad what was that fucking dude before
346480	352100	we start i went and saw the gentleman oh yeah how was that fantastic oh so dying i love
352100	358140	it was fucking good cool that makes me really excited who's the director is uh guy richie
358140	370340	guy richie am i here no i've been doing that i'm sorry dude it was leaving the theater
370340	375180	my parents were like yeah we thought it was going to be a stupid action movie and it was
375180	380620	but we loved it oh hell yeah that sounds right in my eyes i'm totally fan-fucking-tastic
380620	386340	a good guy richie it was yeah it was without some stinkers yeah yeah well it was not a
386340	396660	sneaker it was like like snatch i never saw snatch what that's good yeah is it unlimited
396660	404580	breath sticks what snatch is unlimited back six for sure it's my favorite rotten tomatoes
404580	412500	anyway that's all i have to say all right so this man who just walked into the circular
412500	418980	meeting room is wearing a white dress shirt gray slacks and black shoes there are six
418980	425360	chairs and a half circle all facing a single chair that this man stands in front of as
425360	431300	he introduces himself hello there folks my name is james and i am the executive director
431300	443680	here at calm comfy campground i need everyone to roll a constitution check what pass fail
443680	452380	pass solid fail okay so justin charles digby and thomas bradley cooper would both realize
452380	460980	that that's your name that this room is sort of tilted as you're walking to your seats
460980	468400	you feel an uneasiness in your balance as this room is tilted a bit toward the chair
468400	474560	that is alone on the other side and you all sit down in this half circle and he sits down
474560	478120	with you i pull the chair out for angela even though there's nothing that she's scooting
478120	482880	up to i just kind of stand behind and pull it out let her sit and push it under thank
482880	488920	you so much for really like seeing me in that moment and acknowledging that i'm here of
488920	493740	course i want to start by introducing myself and telling you a little bit about this place
493740	501040	we obviously as you know uh specialize in taking people who need to focus on something
501040	507600	and get that focus either a little bit more accurate or there at all some people need
507600	513180	to be forced all the way in so uh we're just here to help you achieve whatever desires
513180	519220	you may be heading toward we can help you with that goal and i just think the group
519220	524120	session is the best way to start any of these sort of weekend events so if everyone could
524120	529100	go around and introduce themselves i think that would be absolutely fantastic well i
529100	537100	am angela fairfield and i'm here with my husband raj hey hey there hey there folks and we're
537100	543980	here to really focus on like moving forward in our marriage and making this thing last
543980	549500	and and really like we both care so much about each other that i think that we're going to
549500	555340	be able to do it right raj we're certainly gonna gonna try of course i'll do i'm open
555340	567060	and uh i'm willing and was that walter clapping walter claps james looks around the room at
567060	574060	the others okay well uh let's uh jump in here uh i like to play two truths and a lie to
574060	579200	get things started so basically how this works is we'll go around the half circle here and
579200	587300	everyone will say three statements two of which are true and one of which is a lie and
587300	592940	after you say the three statements we'll each go around and ask a question about the three
592940	597740	statements to try to determine which one the lie is right so we'll ask a question you'll
597740	601520	have to answer it and then we can all kind of gauge who each other are and how we react
601520	606760	to each other i've got a question shoot psychologically what is the point of this game oh it's just
606760	611340	to help with these group sessions moving along we really want there to be an air of openness
611340	615600	and vulnerability and so we think the best way to do that is to have you all know each
615600	622360	other why lie in the background i ask alan what is openness it's just a willingness to
622360	627440	connect with others i believe who the fuck is alan thank you alan is the older man who
627440	632860	is the tall lead man wearing the charcoal suit who is there with the 16 year old walter
632860	637740	when he notices that they're there together i give you guys both like a strange look i
637740	642780	am still just looking at my feet taking this in i lean to the council it was like a batman
642780	648880	situation as his ward puts yeah i think it's definitely a batman type situation uh they
648880	653180	can probably explain to you their father-son dynamic more than i could but let's go ahead
653180	657500	and start with uh charles digby down there you got two treats in the life for me sir
657500	663300	yeah i got a couple for you fire away i blackmailed the mayor of the city i have an overweight
663300	664700	cat named rolo
664700	677300	she's working on it she was you guys stopped i sold one of my kidneys to buy my new car
677300	681360	oh those are some spicy ones all right let's go around the circle here and ask some questions
681360	691680	let's start with you bradley why'd you sell your kidney i mean what kind of car
691680	702060	it's a uh a new mobile lie that's the lie i agree did you show us your belly i would
702060	708480	like to ask openness i would like to show us go with his line of questioning and ask
708480	714120	to see the renal scar i don't feel comfortable enough with you guys to to do that i look
714120	718800	at uh what's your character's name bradley cooper that's not a famous person's name yeah
718800	725940	i look at bradley and i go i agree with your thought it is a lie thanks charles how much
725940	731600	is uh kidney going for these days it's about 20 000 or so did the car cost all of that
731600	736260	money or did you have some left over i had some left over what'd you spend it on got
736260	741620	a new camera what was your first lie my first lie that you ever told the first lie that
741620	746700	no the first lie of the three that you read you uh you blackmailed a mayor what was that
746700	752420	about i had some stuff on them what did you have on the mayor dad i can handle this oh
752420	757580	i'm part of the group as well and i would like to contribute so what what did you have
757580	764040	on the mayor there alan let the kids be i accept the line of questioning i'm not allowed
764040	769140	i'm not allowed to discuss it that's part of the blackmail deal did you get money for
769140	774620	it or was it some other yes you got money for it for blackmailing the mayor yes i do
774620	781640	want to reiterate that this is two truths and a lie both of these seem like lies but
781640	786080	one of them isn't one of them's fake he got money from either blackmailing the mayor or
786080	792860	selling his kidney that's how i pulled up here in a new mobile i but he wouldn't need
792860	798720	money twice no one needs no one needs more money so i i reached my things i reached my
798720	806060	hand out and poke him in like the side walter i like where where a kidney scar would be
806060	812620	walter you can't just poke people i i also go in and start it is part of this is part
812620	817280	of the game i have to win the second thing he said let's go ahead and try to not touch
817280	821340	each other during this game if that's okay with i'm pretty uncomfortable with what's
821340	827880	happening here what was the second thing he said hey do i feel a scar through my can i
827880	836840	roll that can i roll like search or something yeah roll search no roll surgery tied i got
836840	849660	30 in surgery that's a 10 oh my god okay you go ahead and roll a d10 for damage three
849660	857700	okay and so if you can i get a pencil please as you reach in uh before charles can pull
857700	869940	away charles does he feel a surgery scar there he does not oh i believe that that is the
869940	875340	lie if he touched him and there's no scar if there's no scar i bet that's the lie i
875340	884140	agree calm down i get like really fucking uncomfortable and i'm like kind of like hugging
884140	887780	myself a little bit like looking down at the ground and i'm like what was the second thing
887780	892940	he said i have an overweight cat named rolo why don't you put it on a diet or something
892940	901940	she's trying i feel like that is the truth all right let's go ahead and uh i think everyone
901940	907060	is made vocal their choices there hold on buddy so what'd you get from the mayor i'm
907060	911300	not allowed to say i want to human that okay roll human for me you said money though didn't
911300	919620	i thought he said money oh i did say money i successfully roll human and i say wait a
919620	925300	minute earlier you said it was money oh fuck how much money what was the secret
928500	933300	i i can't say all right i think he's repeated that a couple times so let's go ahead and get
933300	939300	you to come clean here which one was the line what were the truths the truths were i did in fact
939380	946020	as you guessed blackmail the mayor i also have an overweight cat one might say morbidly obese cat
946660	954580	named rolo after her favorite candy that might have something to do with it yeah what do you
954580	961140	say once she lost weight she has she hasn't lost weight all right well i think we all got to know
961140	966500	each other pretty well there through that little exercise for charles yeah we know he's a fucking
966500	972660	liar well that's part of the game there bradley i know this all right well you're up next so

1250900	1255620	trying to keep the money in his bank what does steak taste like steak oh i like the meaty
1256420	1261300	just ripping something apart questioning what's uh what what's that's a ribeye part from from

1291700	1295060	i lean over to angela that's how you figure it out pretty quick
1295860	1300180	okay you're right okay it's not my favorite show i've seen it a couple times i i like
1300180	1305460	that milburn driesdale but i i just couldn't think of anything else on the spot you got me
1305460	1313860	okay well i guess that was pretty short wind damn got it oh my god walter looks up and says
1313860	1321460	black gold oil that is uh walter if you want to go next following your father there this is going
1321460	1328340	to be very difficult for me because i do not like to lie but i will do it for the sake of community
1328340	1340900	i don't own a bed i had a total hip replacement last year and i have only owned one pair of shoes
1340900	1346820	as an adult i want to look tennis yeah i look at the shoes what do them shoes look like what
1346820	1352980	do they look like they are pristine white new balances okay i'm pretty sure i know the lie
1352980	1357780	but just to be sure i want to kick them in the hip not like hard i want to like knock them over
1357780	1363620	with my foot what i just want to see if he can stand or if his hip got replaced bradley that is
1363620	1368740	not the kind of behavior that we want to do here well but you're reacting to that as what was the
1368740	1374740	result of my behavior is he on the ground as bradley's foot comes up to my hip i grab it that'll
1374740	1381940	be a strength yeah let's see hold on strength or can i use martial arts you can use martial arts
1382820	1388900	either way i got martial arts i got an 85 unarmed combat don't roll don't roll worse than me
1389940	1400100	i got a one so fucking kill him he shatters your hip no it's contested whether or not it was
1400900	1409540	you destroy this child what do you want to do oh i just want to kind of like push him with my foot
1409540	1415940	and see if he can stand up i want to test his hip all right as his foot comes into me i try to
1415940	1423060	grab it but his foot is moving too fast he hits me in the hip and pushes me over like three inches
1423060	1428020	but then i immediately stand back up completely straight roger jumps out of his chair hey whoa
1428020	1432980	yeah that's not the kind of behavior that we want to like do in these group sessions like i said
1432980	1437380	about touching people earlier it's mostly a physical thing that i'm talking about right now
1437380	1442020	so if we want to not do that from here on moving forward otherwise i'm gonna have to
1442020	1447220	as soon as this happens i i stand straight and look down in my shoes are you all right walter
1447220	1453460	i am fine bradley is telling me that i am lying he's like in a practiced kung fu stance he's kind
1453460	1457860	of bouncing on the heels of his feet but he sits down when you sit back down walter alan kind of
1457860	1463060	pats you on the leg and he's like you did a great job just then my father has told me three strikes
1463060	1469380	and you're out that is one strike but i don't hold it against you cool

1490980	1497620	not a vampire okay i want to get this over with i feel uncomfortable telling a lie because it's
1498260	1504740	against what i believe in what do you believe in well many things but that's not the point of this
1504740	1510100	exercise to get to know one another right yeah but that's it what's at your core kid you would
1510100	1516420	have to ask my father that i did not i've not asked that question but i i think that is beside
1516420	1523700	the point of this exercise please tell me how i'm lying you should walk across the room for us

2139780	2146180	great lakey walk we like to guess this is new we like to give jack his uh his his amount of space
2146180	2151300	that you know he requires he's been here a long time and i'm sorry is his name jack russell yeah
2151300	2156500	that's his name jack russell like the dog bouncy dog that's hilarious that's actually
2163860	2169780	and you walk up to this boat house which is a like uh it's a two-story apartment and underneath
2169780	2175140	there are pillars coming down and there are spots for canoes that are floating in the water
2175140	2180740	underneath the second story apartment are there any other boats here or is it just the canoes
2180740	2188260	just six canoes and as you walk you see that a man is walking down from the apartments and
2189140	2192740	i'm in the wrong google doc you sure you're not still on the floating walkway
2193780	2200500	you mean the little lakey walk and so from the little long big wakey walk
2201780	2207620	wakey walk because you're awake and you're walking uh you see jack russell who's the boat man who's
2207620	2211860	walking down some stairs on the side of the apartment down to greet you he's a short
2211860	2217620	stout man in his later years and as you approach you see that he's got a thick white beard that
2217620	2225460	makes his round face look even rounder the bags under his eyes are large and fluffy and he's
2225460	2235940	wearing a dark fluffy fluffy okay the thick luxurious fur you started to say puffy and then
2235940	2246580	you changed to fluffy you just really want to take a nap on these bags he's wearing a dark navy beanie
2246580	2252980	and a wool plaid shirt underneath olive corduroy overalls i'm thinking about the guy that plays
2252980	2257780	trumpet in neutral milk hotel well i'm always thinking about the guy who plays trumpet in
2257780	2264660	neutral milk hotel uh yeah so everyone this is jack russell the boat man and he'll be taking
2264660	2269540	care of all your canoe needs i'm gonna head on back so after you wrap up here and get all your
2269540	2277060	information you can go back onto your cottages or feel free to roam the grounds and he takes off
2277060	2285380	back down the large flaky flock and walk a flock of lake and he walks back and he's gone roger
2285380	2290740	holds out a hand to jack jack i'm roger i'm curious what kind of not to use around here
2292900	2299220	honestly for uh for my ties you know i go with the fucking shit yeah i was doing you doing you
2299220	2303060	oh fuck oh i thought you were i was doing i thought you were doing jebediah from the
2303060	2309780	plus what kind of uh knots are using here on the stock uh i assume a clove hitch you
2309780	2314260	got anything uh special up your sleeve hey you know it's mostly clove hitch you know it's uh
2314260	2321060	do it again for ties you know i got windsor man after my heart i see and yeah so everyone here
2321060	2326740	you know come down come close you know get around here we got six canoes right and so there's enough
2326740	2331380	for everyone to take them out whenever you need them you're gonna want to go ahead and grab a life
2331380	2336420	jacket there's life jackets right over here and he points at a bin it's got a bunch of life jackets
2336420	2342260	in it you're all seemingly adults he looks at you walter he's like except for you how old are you
2343140	2350020	what is the number that you need to hear all right it seems smart enough so all of you will
2350020	2355380	be required to take out life jackets in the canoes with you and you head on out but you don't have to
2355380	2359780	wear them except for i'm guessing you if you're under 18 you might want to have that on for the
2359780	2365380	galatee reasons should i put two of them on you can put two of them on if you want but it'll be
2365380	2370580	safer if you just have one duly noted all right so you're never gonna go out without them and
2370580	2374820	you're never gonna go out by yourself in a canoe if you go out by yourself in a canoe you're gonna
2374820	2381460	have a bad time we always say stick to two in a canoe right so you gotta have two people in the
2381460	2387380	canoe what do we gotta have in a canoe to make it work that's right the canoe good job everyone
2387380	2392580	thank you for paying attention honestly this is great so many groups get into in talking and
2392580	2399700	doing different voices it's very obnoxious what do you mean i don't even know why i brought it up
2399700	2404180	that's on me that's my bad everyone i'm so sorry why did i even invite that into the realm of
2404180	2411060	possibility so that's why we always stick to two in a canoe so stuff like that doesn't happen all
2411060	2417300	right now these waters these waters out here you look at them they're very calm right but
2417300	2425140	that's tricky isn't it it is it no not so much it's very easy to can do around this lake
2428900	2434340	however some people get a big head right i'm guessing you just looking at everything about you
2434340	2439380	you're probably going to get a bit cocky out there and there's nothing that the water takes
2439380	2445860	as such a dis to its face i say dis all the time it's one of my favorite words i mean it's
2445860	2451780	perfectly acceptable 26 years ago hey we're living in the past mate i'm living in the future i mean
2451780	2456100	hypothetically and so the water right it's it's mean
2459300	2465540	right it's me but it's yeah i'm scared it's super fucking calm right but you know it can be mean
2465540	2470980	at times right because the water is the most powerful thing that exists on this realm outside
2470980	2478580	of all and he looks up into the sky and the sun has gone down now so you've got just a beautiful
2478580	2486820	sight of the countless stars up in the sky except for those right mate right the endlessness of
2486820	2494420	space isn't it if you get out there there's nothing more powerful sometimes i feel like
2494420	2500900	maybe i'm just floating and all of this is some sort of mental reaction to everything
2500900	2507860	that i'm having as i'm just losing oxygen i'm i'm sorry jack russell have you been to space
2508980	2515540	no no but sometimes i look up there and i wonder if maybe i'm not down here you know you ever get
2515540	2521940	that yes i would also posit that water would still be powerful up there in fact maybe more
2521940	2526820	so you could use it to stay alive or to push off of something if you needed to you could
2526820	2535780	shoot it out of a hose or when you were talking about this clouds are also water so technically
2535780	2543700	in the sky there is water as well so i think that just adds to what you are talking about you guys
2543700	2549540	are all really validating me at this time and i appreciate it you know it's not too many times
2549540	2555220	that we get people who are not so raw and ready at the beginning of the weekend you know some
2555220	2560340	people are a bit meft in the head so it's nice that you guys are all taking a group mentality
2560340	2565380	to try to validate each other's existences and thoughts and i really appreciate that so does
2565380	2571940	everyone have well it's just shit we are doing each other i do in the same voice oh i want brad
2571940	2580980	lincoln i'm gay and i want your job um honestly i think we're all just uh i think we feel a little
2580980	2587780	protective of you because of the the thick and fluffy patch of hair underneath your eyes it's
2587780	2594900	pretty adorable he rubs it and he's like yeah it's been on my face a long time in there is it
2594900	2601380	now i grew it over the summer it's nice though to have a bit of protection from all this wind
2601380	2605860	and you know if you happen to get into water it's nice to have it and you know not you just sort of
2605860	2612660	feel are you laughing at me this is like a if snl try to do colin farrell i am colin farrell
2613780	2619780	and i'm bradley cooper and maybe in 26 years those names will be famous but not today no
2619780	2625540	it's a fucking fairy tale here though but also isn't your name jack russell yeah my name is jack
2625540	2634740	russell what's happening hey i think we're just terrible hey jack if we do take a boat out is
2634740	2639780	there any place you recommend maybe a nice cove somewhere or something yeah you'll find no coves
2639780	2645460	around this area right so it's just circles on circles so we got a circular island with a
2645460	2652740	circular lake right around it engulfing it eating it alive from the inside you're gonna find just
2652820	2657940	roundness at all the points around i'm so sorry jack wouldn't be eating it alive from the outside
2657940	2663860	of the you know what you're right it is it's an external force this water is right pushing against
2663860	2670500	just over and over repeatedly just thrusting thrusting thrusting there's water at the bottom
2670500	2681700	of the ocean oh does anyone have any questions uh are these our boats like uh stand down one
2681700	2688580	so we got is it but specifically like is my boat that one no or or take out any of them that you
2688580	2693620	want anyone that's left here you can take out right and so to answer your question there sir
2693620	2702100	young sprightly man it's gonna be right over there and he points to this spot that the shoreline has
2702100	2707940	clearly even from this distance you can tell canoes have like entered this shoreline and left
2707940	2713060	a bunch of divots up there and he's like right there that's a good trail that's the best trail

2816100	2823140	unless anyone has any more questions about the water the canoes or how to get from here to there
2823140	2828260	on this cold water but just remember what do we remember always have a life jacket for each
