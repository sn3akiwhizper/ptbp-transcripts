0	8000	My life is great, and it's all my fault
8000	16000	Cause my life is great, and it's all mine
16000	30000	Cause my life is great, and it's all mine
40000	44000	Hey, I'm Zach and this is an announcement.
44000	50560	During this month of December, in the year of our Wolf 2022, so far, the Patreon for Pretending to
50560	59840	Be People is up $44.98. Pretty rad. Now, if the month were to end right now, we'd take that $44.98
59840	68080	and we would match it. So now we're talking $89.96. We would take that $89.96 and we would donate it
68080	73760	to a crisis cold weather shelter here in Springfield. But it's not the end of the
73760	79440	month yet, and we're going to match new and upgrading Patreon subscriptions through the entire
79440	86480	month of December. So we'll double whatever we're up for December and send it on over to a cold
86480	91840	weather shelter here in our community that takes in all genders, which unfortunately isn't common
91840	98320	in our area yet. The shelter is open on any night when the forecast in this here part of Missouri
98320	104720	is below 32 degrees, and it's hosted at Asbury UMC with three other churches joining in to help
104720	110160	this need that's not currently being met by anyone else. So let's raise some money to help people
110160	116720	doing good. Last year the Patreon shot up by like 400 bucks. We matched that 400, donated $800
116800	121760	to the crisis cold weather shelter. I'd very much like to beat that figure this year, so
122320	130080	I don't know if we can get a raffle into the mix. Our Splashylvania Fastpass starts at $5 a month,
130080	137680	and other tiers take place at multiples of five. So for every $5 you spend subscribing or upping
137680	143120	your subscription this month on Patreon, you'll get an entry into the raffle. There will be three
143120	150240	raffle winners. Two raffle winners will receive a PTBP shirt of their choosing, including the
150240	156160	designs from the website, the merch store, the Patreon exclusive designs from season one,
156160	162640	the new Patreon exclusive designs for season two, which will be announced later this month
162640	170240	and available on Patreon in January. But the third raffle winner, however, they can,
170240	177920	if they want to, play in a one-shot that I've written alongside the cast of PTBP as their
177920	184080	fellow players on a little video call. If that's not something you want, we can also just send you
184080	188800	a t-shirt, no worries. Now we did a raffle a couple years ago to support the bail fund,
188800	195840	and we put up a match cap, which was wise because y'all raised over $5,000 that time,
195840	201680	and matching that would have bankrupted me. So we'll go ahead and throw a $2,000 match cap on
201680	207440	this sucker with our hopes high that y'all go off, because we'll gladly match it to help keep folks
207440	212960	in our community warm during this cold season. And for additional sweetener in this wildly
212960	219200	saccharine pot of sugar and syrup, we just dropped our contention PD Halloween special.
219200	224800	It's the Butterfinger Bandit Keith Beans on our Patreon. The audio episode of that is now up,
224800	230160	fully edited, ready for your ear holes. The boys were playing their season one characters,
230720	237520	but like peanuts-aged kids, and they solved a mysterious theft that they witnessed at
237520	243600	Klinker's daycare during the Halloween party. We had a blast, and we were back in contention.
243600	248960	It was so much fun, and we're gonna do it again. So moving forward in the Patreon,
249200	255920	starting this Monday night at 7 37 p.m. Central Time in the Den of Sin, we're gonna be kicking
255920	264400	off our new Patreon campaign, and Thomas will be premiering his handler skills with a homebrew
264400	271840	that he's calling The Lost Treasure of John Lee Pettymore. So Joe, Luke, and I will all be playing
271840	278800	members of the Pettymore family in the wake of the events of season one, and we're so fucking
278800	286160	stoked for this. Oops, all Pettymore's adventure. The audio episode of that will be out this month,
286160	292480	and episode 18 of season two will be out next Friday, December 9th. So let's help folks in
292480	299600	our community stay warm. You'll get fun bonus content, and you'll feel good. And that is a sick
299600	314800	combination.
