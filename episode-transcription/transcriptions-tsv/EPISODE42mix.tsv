0	11160	Hello friends, strangers, bits of biological matter, and hitchhikers from all over the
11160	12160	galaxy.
12160	19120	I am your guide Wolf the Dog, here to disseminate information and tips to help better your life
19120	22080	in the vast emptiness of space.
22080	29600	Get your towels ready, cause it's gonna be a wet one here at 694.2 PTBP, the galaxy's
29600	33200	only holistic radio station.
33200	38360	I hope y'all are ready to buy some of my supplements, cause we got a new Howlin' with Wolf this
38360	39360	week.
39360	44880	This one comes from Man's Best Friend's Best Friend on Twitter, and Zach's friend Jack
44880	46440	in real life.
46440	52160	Note here says, your wedding reception this weekend made Zach real fuckin' happy.
52160	54900	You two compliment each other so beautifully.
54900	57460	He has a personal request for Wolfie.
57460	63540	He writes, at some point in the show Zach was having a drink with 1800 and some type
63540	66100	of seltzer or soda water I think.
66100	72700	Problem is, I'm too lazy to go back and find the episode slash recipe lol, so I'd like
72700	79500	to request a formalization of the drink recipe, with measurements included, read by Mr. Dog.
79500	84100	Ooh baby, Mr. Dog, I love the ring of that.
84140	89540	Well best friend, I'm in the delightful position of being able to deliver exactly what you
89540	90540	request.
90540	95940	I have here the recipe for Zach's Roleplay and Juice.
95940	103700	It is two ounces 1800 silver tequila and one ounce Grand Marnier in a rocks filled glass
103700	110340	with crushed ice, topped with grapefruit spindrift sparkling water, served with a lime wedge
110340	115380	that should be promptly squeezed and muddled into the drink with dirty fingers.
115380	120900	Enjoy the blessing and curse of being the Luis Mendoza of your roleplaying group.
120900	127020	He's the kid from D2, The Mighty Ducks, and D3, The Mighty Ducks, who could skate real
127020	129420	fast but could not stop.
129420	135620	You know, people call Wolf the Luis Mendoza of radio, I uh, I don't know what it means
135620	137620	but people keep saying it.
137620	142340	Remember, if you want to write up something for your wolf to how, tag at Pretending Pod
142340	147860	on Instagram or Twitter, tag Pretending To Be People on Facebook, or write a 5 star review

152380	158020	Also get up on the contest happening over on the subreddit, r slash pretending to be
158020	163660	people, all entries have a shot at winning a D&D 5e starter set.
163660	168060	If anything, go check out all the brilliant entries on the thread so far, including a
168060	173340	work of staggeringly beautiful non-fiction that depicts love between Joe Terry and his
173340	175220	character Clark Bishop.
175220	178660	Seriously y'all, it's there, and it's delicious.
178660	181980	Speaking of facts, it is the news.
181980	187620	Last time, Kathy Piston, Doug Jacobs, and the body of Agent Trent Chad, Keith Vigna,
187620	192820	Clark Bishop, and John Lee Kevinmore did their best to survive what seemed to be an
192820	194820	imminent demise.
194820	200580	After a lethal contest with a human man that is also somehow seemingly part fish and a
200580	206860	monstrous giant version of the same abomination, Keith Vigna fell asleep due to blood loss,
206860	211360	taking us now to the darkness inside his unconscious mind.
211360	216440	It is kudzu with no backbone.
241360	245520	Keith, yes.
245520	251120	In the darkness, you see a woman wearing old-timey clothing.
251120	256000	She looks very normal, except for the hole in the middle of her head.
256000	261940	Regardless of how she turns to look either way, you can see right through the middle
261940	265600	of her head, and she is walking toward you.
265600	271680	As she walks, her clothes change multiple times, as if she's in an unnatural fashion
271680	276600	show that is moving forward in time, decade by decade.
276600	282920	She pulls out a Zippo lighter, and as it hits the ground, you see the House of Chief Maggie
282920	285760	Cook go up in flames.
285760	290600	You saw this happen in the front yard, but this time, right now, you see it from the
290600	291800	backyard.
291800	297740	The fire spreads and explodes toward you, over you, through you, and you turn around
297740	306240	to see these flames ignite the pond, Bean's Pond, and immediately, the water evaporates.
306240	313300	Looking down into a dry basin filled with fish flopping their final flops, you see your
313300	321080	brother Ferguson Beans, crouched over a hatch in the ground, wearing a cowboy hat and spurs,
321360	324960	and the watch your father, William, gave him.
324960	328480	You look down on your wrist, and the watch is there.
328480	335400	You look up, and the pond is filled with water and animals, and Tildy B. Mitchell comes walking
335400	341320	up out of the water toward you, and darkness fills your vision once more.
351080	362160	Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna is out cold, and it is your turn to act.
362160	363160	Nice.
363160	370160	I'm going to move over there by Kathy, and I'm going to take a shot at that one nearest.
370160	373080	Go ahead and roll firearms for me.
373080	377440	This is just one of the regular old fish men.
377440	378960	Just a regular fish man.
378960	381080	I rolled 24 again.
381080	382080	Wow.
382080	384360	On different dice also.
384360	385360	That's weird.
385360	386360	So strange.
386360	387360	This room absolutely loves you.
387360	389360	Go ahead and roll damage for me.
389360	390360	1d10.
390360	392840	Oh, there we go.
392840	393840	That's a nine.
393840	394840	Nine.
394840	395840	All right.
395840	396840	Hell yeah.
396840	397900	And that one actually goes down as well.
397900	399280	You are dropping these things.
399280	400280	Fuck yeah.
400280	401280	Like flies.
401280	407100	Hook, line, and sinker.
407100	409860	And as it dies, it says, barely knew her.
409860	413860	Oh, that one was so chill.
413860	418820	Super chill fish man.
418820	419820	John Lee Pettymore.
419820	420820	It's your turn.
420820	424660	I don't know what stat this would be, and I'm hoping you would agree with the American
424660	430420	government during World War II that every American boy can throw a baseball.
430420	436460	I want to roll a flashbang just right on top of Keith Vigna basically, like in the middle
436460	440260	of the monster and the other guy who's right on top of him.
440260	443060	And there was another guy that killed him because he's a bad ass.
443060	444060	So yeah, I want to do that.
444060	445060	Okay.
445060	447220	That is going to be an athletics roll.
447220	449700	Who do I have that?
449700	450700	Kind of 50.
450700	451700	50%.
451700	453500	That's a pretty good chance.
453500	454500	Yes.
454500	455500	41.
455500	456500	Yeah.
456500	457500	Describe what happens there.
457500	460920	So yeah, I just kind of like from my position on the catwalk, pull the pin on the splash
460920	467880	bang and I just chuck it underhanded and it sails in an arc and just lands right on
467880	470280	Keith Vigna's chest.
470280	473860	He's unconscious and it explodes.
473860	475360	Would that burn his skin?
475360	476440	A little, maybe.
476440	479920	Not like two hit points worth or anything.
479920	480920	You know what?
480920	486320	It might go down to the armor, the metal beneath his skin veneer, but it's not going to do
486320	487320	any real damage.
487320	489360	He's going to look so cool after this.
489360	490360	Yeah.
490800	491800	Oh yeah, he will.
491800	492800	Oh my gosh.
492800	493800	You're welcome.
493800	497600	The scars on his shoulder and back and then it's like, kind of like a cartoonish like
497600	498600	soot.
498600	499600	Yes.
499600	500600	Explosions.
500600	501600	Explosions.
501600	502600	No eyebrows.
502600	506440	Blown his shirt off.
506440	512960	And yeah, and so this like a ball of light and sound just like emerges in the face of
512960	519040	this giant fish monster and the other fish monster.
519040	521720	And hopefully disorients him for a turn or so.
521720	525640	They both immediately dive into the water.
525640	527640	That could be good or bad.
527640	528640	nearby.
528640	530520	Doug, go see if they're around.
530520	535960	So sorry, before they do that, Kathy Piston is up next and she moves past Clark on the
535960	536960	other side.
536960	542880	Oh, actually I'm in my mind, you kind of bend over and she does a roll over your back.
542880	543880	Yeah, she does.
543880	545200	Rush hour two style.
545200	546200	Super cool.
546200	551320	And on one knee gets in position and nobody understand the words that are coming out of
551320	554320	your mouth, Kathy Piston.
554320	556920	And she fucking rolls a success again.
556920	558680	She's a goddamn assassin.
558680	560800	Kathy Piston has not rolled over 40.
560800	562520	Fucking John Wick.
562520	563960	And she rolled a nine.
563960	564960	Yeah, Kathy.
564960	566160	That a girl.
566160	576000	So she fires into the smaller of the two fishmen, the humanoid one, and it takes an absurd amount
576000	577000	of damage.
577000	581280	You can see blood and acres just like leaking out of this thing.
581280	586240	It is now its turn as well as its fish friend in the very back of the room that you can
586240	590380	see on the other side of this giant beast thing.
590380	595380	And they both dive into the water nearest them.
595380	605080	It is the giant creatures turn and it looks down where it had just had its meal ready
605160	611560	and you could tell it smelled and it knew this, this would be a meal that I've already
611560	619400	had and it was taken away from me from the inside and I must feast once more.
619400	624080	But the flashbang confused it and it swipes down into the water near it thinking that
624080	628320	it's where the catwalk is and it falls face first directly into the water.
628320	629320	What an idiot.
629320	630680	It's a stupid thing.
630680	633320	Fucking fish dick.
635120	636120	I love fish dicks.
636120	638120	I love fish dicks.
638120	641760	Clark Bishop, it's your turn.
641760	645720	And this is the, uh, who, who pressed the button?
645720	646720	Was that John?
646720	647720	John Lee Pennymore?
647720	648720	All right.
648720	649920	So when it's your turn, it'll have been one round.
649920	650920	Is that right?
650920	654680	I did that at the end of my first turn and I had the turn where I threw a flash grenade.
654680	656040	So that would have been one round.
656040	657040	Absolutely.
657040	658040	So it'll be two rounds.
658040	659040	Coming up on two full rounds.
659040	660640	Clark Bishop, it is your turn.
660640	663120	The elevator door is not moving.
663120	664240	What's the numbers above it say?
664280	667280	Oh, that's an interesting question.
667280	668280	666.
668280	669280	Why?
669280	674840	Uh, I'm going to, is that, is my distance to Keith two movements or one?
674840	677840	Looks like two to me.
677840	678840	I will.
678840	679840	I got to take it.
679840	680840	So I'm going to do it.
680840	685520	That's real scary, but I'm going to have to just be there with the plan of picking them
685520	688080	up next round.
688080	690000	You're right there.
690000	691000	John Lee Pennymore.
691000	693040	It's been two rounds since you pressed the elevator button.
693960	695480	What do you want to do this round?
695480	698480	I want to run out as far as I can towards Clark.
698480	699480	All right.
699480	707040	You run to the end of the catwalk at the point where the room begins and it is now, it would
707040	708280	be Luke's terms.
708280	710120	Oh, rip.
710120	715840	It is now the Fishman is the turn of the Fishman gotcha.
715840	719560	And the Fishman turn of the Fishman, the turn of the Fishman.
720120	724840	One of them, the one you would assume maybe that was in the back of the room pops up quite
724840	727120	nearby.
727120	733720	And the one that was nearer Keith and it's giant compatriot busts up out of the water
733720	741160	and then it's going to roll a crit success.
741160	742400	So it jumped real good.
742400	743640	I mean, who cares?
743640	748640	So the other side of Doug is at the elevator door at the elevator door time to waste that
748640	752480	on the other side in between Doug Jacobs and the elevator door.
752480	754200	And it critically succeeded.
754200	761960	Basically what it did is it hopped up out and it is swinging its scythe at Doug Jacobs
761960	762960	in the air.
762960	763960	Doug Jacobs.
763960	764960	Oh, wow.
764960	776360	Doug Jacobs was not full of health as one might say.
776360	784880	And with this critical success, while the fish person is in the air, it swings its scythe
784880	791400	all the way through the neck of Doug Jacobs and the body of agent Trent Chad and lands
791400	798520	standing in between you all and the elevator as the body and head fall separately into
798520	805680	the two opposite sides of water on either side of the catwalk.
805680	806680	He was a good boy.
806680	807680	Poor agent Doug Chad.
807680	831680	So at that exact moment that the song hits its climax, claws grab onto the catwalk just
831680	837280	on either side, just next to Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna.
837280	844720	And it starts pulling and pulling and trying to rip this catwalk down into the water.
844720	846720	Oh no.
846720	847720	He rolls an op too.
847720	848720	Of course he does.
848720	849720	It slows.
849720	850720	It's not very much.
850720	853720	Yeah, it fits contested in any way.
853720	855720	Oh yeah.
855720	859520	Clark gets pulling up against it.
859520	871560	He's like re-riveting it as it comes like popping out.
871560	877860	Clark Bishop needs to make an extremely important strength roll in order to, I assume, hold
877860	881880	on to Keith Vigna and keep the two of you on dry catwalk.
881880	890040	I'm going to have you roll that now against this ought to.
890040	891040	Oh yeah.
891040	892040	Hell yeah.
892040	894320	It's a 54 on a 65.
894320	895320	Congratulations.
895320	898240	Clark, I love that roll.
898240	900160	Do you say anything to his unconscious body?
900160	901160	To Keith's unconscious body?
901160	902280	Yeah, as you're pulling him.
902280	905680	I got you my child.
905680	906680	My baby boy.
906680	908920	Go ahead and roll sanity.
908920	909920	Fuck you too.
910920	912920	That's a fail.
912920	915920	That's a fail over my power.
915920	916920	Oh, all right.
916920	921920	Well go ahead and play that up and remember that you're God and lose one's sanity.
921920	924920	I forgot about that.
924920	929920	Luke's dead ass could make himself useful and bring us some beers.
929920	935920	It's going to depend on how you want to do this mechanically, but what Clark would do
935920	941920	now is he would throw Keith down onto the catwalk, turn around, and he wants to walk
941920	948520	up to the giant fish thing and throw a grenade down its gullet, the frag grenade.
948520	952800	Okay, so you would have to put yourself into the water to do that.
952800	958420	This thing is pulled down successfully and it is in the water now with the catwalk as
958420	960320	you are up on the catwalk.
960320	961720	He's about five feet below you.
961720	962720	I can't.
962720	963720	He can't just toss it down.
963720	964720	Oh, you want to toss a grenade?
965020	970020	I thought you wanted to place it gently inside of its mouth.
970020	972020	Do you assume we're idiots?
972020	973020	Yeah, baseline.
973020	975020	No, of course not.
975020	976020	Come on.
976020	977020	I'm sorry.
977020	978020	I didn't mean it, baby.
978020	981020	Only many times.
981020	985020	Joe, go ahead and roll an athletics check here.
985020	987020	We're going willy-nilly here.
987020	990020	Is there any kind of advantage for being right over it?
990020	991020	Yeah.
991320	995320	So you actually get, because you'll be rolling athletics, to drop it in.
995320	1001320	Maybe a nice beer pong shot this grenade into the mouth of this being.
1001320	1005320	Because it's right there next to you, I'll give you a plus 20% on your athletics.
1005320	1009320	That's really handy because I don't have any, so I got the baseline 30.
1009320	1010320	Alright.
1010320	1011320	And then you add 20.
1011320	1012320	I got a 50 on this.
1012320	1013320	50% chance here.
1013320	1016320	Here we go.
1016320	1019320	I pass a 37 on a 50.
1019320	1020320	Alright.
1020620	1021620	Roll 4d6.
1021620	1022620	Ooh, baby.
1022620	1023620	Baby, baby.
1023620	1026620	You got a couple of d6s over there?
1026620	1027620	Yes, sir.
1027620	1028620	Actually, I got some here.
1028620	1029620	Never mind.
1033620	1037620	5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
1037620	1041620	11 points of damage with that grenade down inside of its belly.
1041620	1048620	The grenade explodes and you hear the same screeching roar that you heard when the flashbang
1048620	1049620	went off.
1049920	1050920	It's like...
1054920	1056920	Sorry, I was yawning into the mic just then.
1056920	1058920	What was the sound it made?
1058920	1060920	It was actually really similar to what you just did.
1060920	1061920	Could you just...
1065920	1067920	I'm so sorry, I didn't get much sleep last night.
1067920	1068920	We can take a break if you need a Red Bull or something.
1068920	1071920	Yeah, I'm gonna run down to the gas station.
1071920	1073920	And it is John Lee Pettymore's turn.
1073920	1076920	I want to move one space forward and do the same thing.
1076920	1078920	Drop a grenade right on top of it.
1079720	1085220	Roll athletics for me with a plus 20%, putting your athletics at 70% if I'm not mistaken.
1085220	1086220	You are not mistaken.
1088220	1090220	Oh, 70!
1090220	1093220	70 on a 70.
1093220	1095220	Roll 4d6 for damage for me.
1097220	1098220	10.
1098220	1099220	10 total?
1099220	1100220	Yeah.
1100220	1101220	Or did you roll 10 on 1d6?
1101220	1108220	This thing makes the same horrifying noise, but even louder this time.
1108520	1111520	And it starts to kind of gargle.
1111520	1112520	It's like...
1115520	1117520	As it moves into the water.
1117520	1119520	Down below.
1119520	1121520	And it is Kathy Piston's turn.
1121520	1123520	That was the end of my turn.
1123520	1125520	Any change in the elevator?
1125520	1127520	Oh, go ahead and roll alertness for me.
1127520	1129520	7.
1129520	1130520	No.
1130520	1132520	Damn.
1132520	1134520	You know my alertness is 60 and not 6, right?
1138520	1140520	Yes and no.
1143520	1148520	Kathy Piston moves up at the end of the catwalk leading to the elevator door
1148520	1155520	and lines up her shot on the fish man that just took down, decapitated,
1155520	1159520	and smiled at the death of Doug Jacobs.
1159520	1161520	And she rolls another success.
1161520	1162520	Yes!
1162520	1163520	Yes, my murder queen.
1163520	1164520	This girl!
1164520	1166520	Joe, these dice you got me are great.
1166520	1167520	Hell yeah!
1167820	1170820	But she only rolls a 4 on damage.
1170820	1176820	And it doesn't look like it took very much damage at all as she shoots it
1176820	1180820	in its kind of plate amphibious lining there.
1180820	1185820	And some of the sharper parts catch some of the bullets and make it so
1185820	1191820	I don't know why I'm explaining armor on a fish creature to you, but
1191820	1192820	that's what's going on there.
1192820	1195820	The fish man will retaliate.
1196120	1203120	And the fish man that is closest to Kathy Piston rolls a 10 and succeeds
1203120	1209120	and hits her for 7 damage with the scythe and just digs the scythe
1209120	1215120	into her leg and she starts screaming out and she's gonna try to like
1215120	1219120	grab on to the end of the scythe and kind of battle back and forth
1219120	1223120	but as she's battling it's just digging in further and further and
1223420	1228420	it finally hits a nerve in her leg and she just can't take it anymore
1228420	1230420	and falls backwards.
1230420	1233420	Kathy Piston is now bleeding into the water as well.
1233420	1234420	Isn't that good?
1234420	1239420	There's also a fish man that is right next to Clark Bishop and Keith
1239420	1244420	Vigna and he is going to try to pin Clark Bishop to the ground
1244420	1248420	so we are going to roll an opposed test of unarmed combat.
1248420	1249420	Okay.
1249720	1254720	I rolled a 30 succeeding.
1254720	1258720	I rolled a 15 succeeding but lower.
1258720	1264720	So this fish man uses its scythe to pin you to the ground and it
1264720	1271720	puts the long end of the stick up against your throat and it's knee
1271720	1277720	down on the thing and as it's bearing down on you its teeth are gritted
1278020	1285020	and you see this mucusy wet slime form and it's big thick lips and
1285020	1290020	it kind of drips down directly onto your face and just splats.
1300020	1306020	The giant creature jumps out of the water and you can see that it
1306320	1311320	has not taken enough damage to be considered what one might call
1311320	1317320	bloody in a game called D&D and it's coming for you John Lee
1317320	1318320	Pettymore.
1318320	1321320	It's coming for you real fucking hard with one of its claws.
1321320	1325320	It reaches back all the way to get as much momentum as possible and
1325320	1329320	it claws at you and it misses.
1329620	1337620	Kevin Lee Pettymore ducks agilely and doesn't hit its
1337620	1343620	microphone and he flips two birds at the fish.
1343620	1345620	Oh very very very cool.
1345620	1347620	Very cool indeed Clark Bishop.
1347620	1348620	It is your turn.
1348620	1350620	You are pinned currently.
1350620	1355620	The only thing you can do unless you're more creative than I is an
1355620	1358620	unarmed contest to become unpinned.
1358920	1359920	Or unarmed combat.
1359920	1360920	Yeah, I'm going to do that.
1360920	1361920	Get creative.
1361920	1363920	Try to persuade it.
1365920	1366920	Those are the two options.
1366920	1368920	Yeah, I kiss it on the lips.
1368920	1370920	I do things your wife would never do to you.
1378920	1381920	Yeah, I'm going to use the unarmed combat to try and break free.
1385920	1387920	It rolls a 16 succeeding.
1388220	1389220	I failed.
1389220	1391220	74 on a 70.
1391220	1395220	It's actually going to take a shot at you here.
1395220	1396220	Can it do that?
1396220	1397220	It's my turn.
1397220	1398220	Oh, it is your turn.
1398220	1400220	I'll wait until it's its turn.
1400220	1401220	It keeps you pinned though.
1401220	1402220	That's for damn sure.
1402220	1404220	Thomas, it's John Lee Pettymore's turn.
1404220	1407220	Guys, if I don't move do I get two attacks?
1407220	1408220	No.
1408220	1410220	Okay, but you can move and attack?
1410220	1411220	Yeah.
1411220	1412220	Let me pitch you this.
1412220	1417220	I want to move one step backwards while tossing a grenade forward
1417520	1418520	and then shoot a shotgun.
1418520	1420520	I just got mad deja vu.
1420520	1421520	Have you done that move before?
1421520	1422520	No.
1424520	1425520	I sure like it.
1425520	1428520	So I toss my last frag grenade at it while I'm right in front of it
1428520	1429520	and stepping backwards.
1429520	1431520	Okay, I'll give you a plus 20%.
1431520	1432520	Okay.
1434520	1435520	Oh, wait.
1435520	1436520	Oh, wait.
1436520	1437520	Yes.
1437520	1438520	Okay, 61 on a 70 modified.
1438520	1439520	Nice.
1439520	1440520	Nice.
1440520	1442520	It's going to be another 46 of damage.
1442820	1447820	Listeners, we're not saying 46 like the number.
1447820	1450820	Four six-sided die.
1450820	1451820	Indeed.
1451820	1455820	Four D six.
1455820	1457820	Four dicks six.
1457820	1459820	Which is the alternative name of our podcast,
1459820	1461820	but the size is...
1461820	1463820	We found out the math didn't quite work out.
1463820	1465820	Joe throws things on.
1465820	1467820	The weight.
1468120	1470120	Dropped one of my D six and crushed my balls
1470120	1472120	trying to catch it with my legs.
1472120	1474120	The dangers of real playing.
1474120	1476120	So I'm actually going to count that one
1476120	1478120	that's a four right now on the floor.
1478120	1480120	Fucking good because I sacrificed for it.
1480120	1481120	You know what?
1481120	1483120	We've never made rules about squishing your balls
1483120	1485120	while you roll, so let's keep that four.
1485120	1487120	Okay, so four, four, two, and three,
1487120	1488120	which is...
1488120	1489120	Thirteen.
1489120	1490120	Thirteen.
1490120	1491120	Thirteen.
1491120	1492120	Thirteen.
1492120	1493120	Thirteen.
1493120	1494120	Thirteen.
1494120	1495120	Thirteen.
1495120	1496120	Thirteen.
1496420	1497420	Which is...
1497420	1498420	Thirteen.
1498420	1499420	Thirteen.
1499420	1500420	Wow.
1500420	1502420	You do thirteen damage
1502420	1505420	and you actually hear a whimper
1505420	1507420	from this giant creature in front of you.
1507420	1509420	It swallowed a kid!
1511420	1513420	It's like...
1515420	1518420	I don't know if you quite agreed to my pitch
1518420	1520420	but I do want to shoot my shotgun as I...
1520420	1522420	Oh, I did not agree to that.
1522420	1524420	You didn't disagree.
1526420	1528420	I'll let you do what you did. How about that?
1528420	1530420	Well, you would take it away from me if I pressed the point.
1533420	1535420	John Lee Pennymore's dead.
1537420	1539420	John Lee Pennymore, go home, John Lee.
1539420	1541420	John Lee Pennymore falls over heart attack.
1541420	1543420	Dead. Get out of here.
1543420	1545420	You said you trusted me. Trust me now.
1548420	1549420	Good lord.
1549420	1552420	No, I think moving and throwing a grenade seems...
1552420	1554420	seems perfectly reasonable for a turn.
1554720	1559720	And it is going to be Kathy Piston's turn
1559720	1564720	and she just got mucked up in the leg by a scythe.
1564720	1566720	You can say fuck.
1566720	1568720	We've all been doing it.
1568720	1569720	For sure.
1569720	1570720	For real?
1570720	1571720	Yeah.
1571720	1572720	You can even say crap.
1572720	1573720	No, with my mouth?
1573720	1574720	Yeah.
1574720	1575720	Alright.
1575720	1576720	But you can't say beep.
1576720	1578720	Kathy Piston just got...
1580720	1581720	I can't do it.
1581720	1582720	Mucked in the leg by a scythe
1582720	1583720	and she's bleeding all over the place
1584020	1587020	and she looks up with this determination in her eyes
1587020	1589020	and a barrel in her hand.
1589020	1592020	But the gun part, not just the barrel.
1592020	1594020	Yeah, I was like, where'd she get that barrel?
1594020	1596020	I don't know. I don't know. She's good with it.
1596020	1600020	And she is going to once again
1600020	1603020	fire at a fish man
1603020	1607020	succeeding once again on her roll.
1607020	1608020	MVP.
1608020	1610020	She cannot stop. She will not stop.
1610020	1612020	However, she just once again
1612320	1613320	does not roll enough damage
1613320	1615320	to actually damage the creature
1615320	1617320	and therefore, she's like
1617320	1619320	my leg, your leg
1619320	1621320	and she shoots it in the foot
1621320	1623320	and it starts bleeding out
1623320	1626320	and hopping up and down on one foot
1626320	1628320	while still chanting
1628320	1630320	photography, photography
1630320	1632320	photography, photography
1632320	1634320	Very cool. Very cool fish.
1634320	1636320	Very cool fish person.
1639320	1641320	However, it's now that fish person's turn.
1642320	1644320	And it doesn't like being shot in the foot.
1644320	1646320	And so, it's going to come
1646320	1648320	for Kathy Piston.
1651320	1653320	This fish creature takes its scythe out
1653320	1655320	raises it above its head
1655320	1657320	and slams down the scythe
1657320	1659320	into the top of Kathy Piston's skull.
1659320	1661320	No!
1662320	1664320	I need you both to roll sanity
1664320	1666320	for witnessing this horrible event.
1666320	1668320	For some reason that one hurts the most.
1668320	1670320	75
1670620	1672620	A fail above my power.
1672620	1675620	I fail 24 on a 17.
1675620	1677620	Alright. I need you both
1677620	1679620	to lose just one sanity.
1679620	1681620	Kathy Piston was a human
1681620	1683620	trafficking asshole.
1683620	1685620	And just because her death was gruesome
1685620	1687620	does not mean
1687620	1689620	that it may not have been deserved.
1689620	1691620	I don't know if deserved was the right word there
1691620	1693620	but she dead now.
1693620	1695620	Her tank is down.
1697620	1699620	Or no, she was DPS.
1699920	1701920	She's the glass cannon.
1701920	1703920	You hear chants from underwater.
1703920	1706920	MVP! MVP!
1706920	1708920	It's pretty unsettling but also pretty cool.
1710920	1712920	I wonder how Luke's doing.
1712920	1714920	The other fishman
1714920	1716920	is standing on top
1716920	1718920	of Clark Bishop's throat
1718920	1720920	with its scythe pressed down
1720920	1722920	and according to the rules of Delta Green
1722920	1724920	it gets a free shot.
1724920	1726920	It contested me.
1726920	1728920	I can't contest it.
1729220	1731220	Dad!
1731220	1733220	Dad!
1734220	1736220	With an automatic success.
1736220	1738220	Now we're worried
1738220	1740220	about the rules of Delta Green
1740220	1742220	and all of a sudden
1742220	1744220	all of a sudden
1744220	1746220	Zach's an expert.
1746220	1748220	I read the rules today finally.
1748220	1750220	You read a Chuckling Boy post?
1752220	1754220	Quick shout out to user ChucklingBoy
1754220	1756220	on Reddit who is doing
1756220	1758220	incredible work on the subreddit
1758520	1760520	for r slash pretending to be people
1760520	1762520	and it is so cool.
1762520	1764520	He posts these posts
1764520	1766520	on Monday and Thursday called
1766520	1768520	Mythos Monday and Technique Thursday
1768520	1770520	and they are
1770520	1772520	just phenomenal.
1772520	1774520	Awesome reference guide for running
1774520	1776520	a Delta Green game.
1776520	1778520	They are so good you should go and check them out.
1778520	1780520	It's absurd.
1780520	1782520	He has been such a huge supporter
1782520	1784520	of us and we really
1784520	1786520	can't thank him enough for all he's doing.
1786820	1788820	Thanks man.
1788820	1790820	It's really fun to read all those posts.
1790820	1792820	I don't read all of your posts because I'm worried
1792820	1794820	that I'll learn too much and I like
1794820	1796820	being the one who doesn't know a lot about the game.
1796820	1798820	Also he can't read.
1798820	1800820	I just skim him for the stuff
1800820	1802820	that looks neat.
1802820	1804820	That's a pretty letter.
1804820	1806820	Clark this thing
1806820	1808820	just headbutts you for one
1808820	1810820	damage.
1810820	1812820	Breaking your nose just a little bit.
1813620	1815620	You feel an
1815620	1817620	intense rush of pain
1817620	1819620	throughout but it doesn't
1819620	1821620	kill you that's for sure.
1821620	1823620	That puts me at 15.
1823620	1825620	It is the massive
1825620	1827620	creature's turn and it is going
1827620	1829620	to rush
1829620	1831620	John Lee Pettymore who just threw
1831620	1833620	another grenade directly
1833620	1835620	at its face
1835620	1837620	and it rolls a success
1837620	1839620	with the claw.
1839620	1841620	The claw.
1841620	1843620	Oh actually what did you do with your turn?
1843620	1845620	Tossed a grenade at it and took a step backwards.
1845620	1847620	And he pulled out his shield.
1850620	1852620	That is going to be 7 damage
1852620	1854620	and it has a chance
1854620	1856620	to grab you.
1858620	1860620	It failed the grab attempt.
1863620	1865620	But its claw just like
1865620	1867620	swipes at you scratching the
1867620	1869620	shit out of your body
1869620	1871620	in the front part of it
1871620	1873620	ripping your cool clothes that Kevin had
1873620	1875620	all the black tactical gear
1875620	1877620	less tactical now
1877620	1879620	that it's been shredded up by a
1879620	1881620	big fucking claw.
1881620	1883620	It takes me down to 6 hit points.
1883620	1885620	Oh my god.
1885620	1887620	We are fucked.
1887620	1889620	With that I have to teach you.
1889620	1891620	How's that elevator?
1891620	1893620	Roll alertness for me.
1893620	1895620	It's not that turn yet. Never mind.
1895620	1897620	Oh we didn't do it though.
1897620	1899620	It's my last turn.
1899620	1901620	So Clark at the top of this round go ahead and roll
1901620	1903620	an alertness check for me.
1905620	1907620	I fail.
1907620	1909620	An 82 on a 70.
1909620	1911620	That would make sense. I'm on the ground being
1911620	1913620	strangled by a fish man.
1913620	1915620	I wouldn't know what's going on with the elevator.
1915620	1917620	Yeah.
1917620	1919620	I first saw a thing where you just
1919620	1921620	lifted up enough.
1921620	1923620	Just to have something happen
1923620	1925620	maybe.
1925620	1927620	And it's your turn. What would you like to do?
1927620	1929620	You are still being pinned currently.
1929620	1931620	Would you allow
1931620	1933620	can I reach
1933620	1935620	into my boot to grab my other gun
1935620	1937620	and use it to fire up at the
1937620	1939620	creature? No.
1939620	1941620	Then I'm just going to unarmed back at him.
1941620	1943620	So that's the thing with being pinned.
1943620	1945620	It's supposed to completely
1945620	1947620	immobilize you.
1947620	1949620	So he just has to bust out of it with strength.
1949620	1951620	Exactly.
1951620	1953620	Which I should be able to do and I'm having trouble.
1953620	1955620	He'll get it.
1955620	1957620	I succeeded with a 12.
1957620	1959620	I succeeded with a 29.
1959620	1961620	Fuck yeah.
1961620	1963620	He punched this fish bitch in the face.
1963620	1965620	Fish fish.
1965620	1967620	I don't know how the unpinning rules
1967620	1969620	work but can I fling him so hard
1969620	1971620	that he gets away from me?
1971620	1973620	He'll be enough away from you to where you can
1973620	1975620	act naturally or however
1975620	1977620	you want on your next turn but so will he.
1977620	1979620	And or it or
1979620	1981620	whatever a fish person
1981620	1983620	that's you know. Does it do any damage
1983620	1985620	to him? It just unpicks me. No.
1985620	1987620	It just gets him off.
1989620	1991620	Crickets. Yeah it does.
1991620	1993620	Thomas. It's John Lee Pettymore's turn.
1993620	1995620	Okay. Low on health.
1995620	1997620	Yeah. Low on grenades.
1997620	1999620	High in spirit.
1999620	2001620	I'm going to walk up to the big fish creature and
2001620	2003620	blast my shotgun at it.
2003620	2005620	Cool. Point blank.
2005620	2007620	Very cool.
2007620	2009620	Did I get any
2009620	2011620	modifiers for point blank?
2011620	2013620	Right at the fish eye.
2013620	2015620	It definitely seems like you should with a shotgun
2015620	2017620	at close range. Well there's a damage
2017620	2019620	modifier. Oh gotcha.
2019620	2021620	Yeah. I'll give you a plus 20.
2021620	2023620	It's going to be hard to miss. Doesn't matter
2023620	2025620	because I rolled a 53 on a 60.
2025620	2027620	Nice. So yeah. Point blank
2027620	2029620	range. That is
2029620	2031620	3d6. It is indeed.
2031620	2033620	It would be 4 if it was a crit.
2033620	2035620	5, 3, and 2.
2035620	2037620	So 10 again. 10 again.
2037620	2039620	Just like give us a visual of what's
2039620	2041620	going on here. Well John Lee Pettymore
2041620	2043620	he looks like
2043620	2045620	Nick Cage at the end of Mandy.
2045620	2047620	He's just completely covered
2047620	2049620	in blood. You can see
2049620	2051620	this giant just like these
2051620	2053620	gashes down his chest
2053620	2055620	revealing bits of like bone and
2055620	2057620	metal and he kind of staggers
2057620	2059620	towards this thing one space
2059620	2061620	and then just brings his shotgun
2061620	2063620	up to his hip and just blast
2063620	2065620	it right into its fish face.
2065620	2067620	And doing so blows
2067620	2069620	a massive chunk
2069620	2071620	of the fish's teeth
2071620	2073620	these massive human
2073620	2075620	like teeth. This is like a mouth
2075620	2077620	that you could climb up into for
2077620	2079620	fun and it
2079620	2081620	like a quarter of this
2081620	2083620	fish's mouth just
2083620	2085620	dissipates into like blood
2085620	2087620	and dust and slime
2087620	2089620	as the creature
2089620	2091620	just moans and
2091620	2093620	spins away
2093620	2095620	from you as it takes this
2095620	2097620	massive amount of damage.
2097620	2099620	But it is still conscious and it is
2099620	2101620	still moving. I don't know if
2101620	2103620	I'll get a chance so I'd like to say something cool now
2103620	2105620	having heard it so much. So
2105620	2107620	John Lee Kevin Moore
2107620	2109620	he
2109620	2111620	kind of groans
2111620	2113620	looks like tonight McDonald's is serving
2113620	2115620	filet of you.
2117620	2119620	No but for real.
2119620	2121620	And it's so
2121620	2123620	offended and taken aback it dies.
2125620	2127620	MVP.
2127620	2129620	So good Kathy.
2129620	2131620	John one of the
2131620	2133620	other fishmen is the one that
2133620	2135620	just murdered the shit out of
2135620	2137620	Kathy Piston and really
2137620	2139620	fucked her up good comes up
2139620	2141620	behind you and is going
2141620	2143620	to swing at you
2143620	2145620	with its scythe.
2145620	2147620	He rolled a 43
2147620	2149620	on
2149620	2151620	a 25 percent.
2151620	2153620	Nice.
2153620	2155620	And it swings right
2155620	2157620	above your head and you feel
2157620	2159620	the wind brush atop.
2159620	2161620	You see little wisps of hair
2161620	2163620	get shaved right off.
2163620	2165620	Exactly. And the camera
2165620	2167620	immediately whip pans over to
2167620	2169620	one fish man standing
2169620	2171620	near Clark and Keith
2171620	2173620	and it is going to attempt
2173620	2175620	the same thing at
2175620	2177620	Clark Bishop and fucking fails.
2177620	2179620	Oh thank God. Missing wildly
2179620	2181620	after being thrown off
2181620	2183620	of Clark Bishop it doesn't know
2183620	2185620	quite what to do.
2185620	2187620	However
2187620	2189620	what does know what to do
2189620	2191620	is this giant giant beast
2191620	2193620	that is just
2193620	2195620	reeling from the attack
2195620	2197620	sent to it by John Lee
2197620	2199620	Kevin Moore. I need you to
2199620	2201620	roll an unarmed combat
2201620	2203620	contest.
2203620	2205620	18 on a 40.
2205620	2207620	19.
2207620	2209620	Oh my God.
2209620	2211620	Fuck.
2211620	2213620	With
2213620	2215620	claws akimbo on either side
2215620	2217620	of you it grabs on
2217620	2219620	to the catwalk
2219620	2221620	below it and it uses
2221620	2223620	its giant arms to
2223620	2225620	launch itself toward
2225620	2227620	John Lee Pettymore with its mouth
2227620	2229620	wide open and it swallows
2229620	2231620	you whole.
2231620	2233620	Oh.
2233620	2235620	Well
2235620	2237620	Keith got out of this and he's an idiot so
2237620	2239620	this is arguably
2239620	2241620	the safest place I could be right now.
2243620	2245620	With that
2245620	2247620	you take six damage.
2247620	2249620	Oh. Well that's uh
2249620	2251620	that puts me at zero.
2253620	2255620	That puts you at zero zero? Yeah
2255620	2257620	I had six points.
2257620	2259620	Oh shit. John Lee Pettymore
2259620	2261620	the darkness closes in on you
2261620	2263620	as the light above
2263620	2265620	you leaves
2265620	2267620	as this giant creatures mouth
2267620	2269620	closes
2269620	2271620	but you can still feel
2271620	2273620	all of this wet
2273620	2275620	gunk
2275620	2277620	inside and you can feel
2277620	2279620	water
2279620	2281620	and just. I want to spend
2281620	2283620	ten like to avoid major damage.
2283620	2285620	You still
2285620	2287620	feel this water
2287620	2289620	rushing in.
2289620	2291620	Okay we'll put that on pause.
2291620	2293620	My super cool monologuing
2293620	2295620	about the water that you feel
2295620	2297620	as you fucking die. I was
2297620	2299620	I was frantically scanning
2299620	2301620	the little luck thing.
2301620	2303620	The sheep of how to spend luck.
2303620	2305620	Yeah for ten points I can
2305620	2307620	spend uh. You know the last couple
2307620	2309620	episodes could have used some luck spins maybe.
2309620	2311620	I don't know. Anyway where are we at here?
2311620	2313620	I'm at twenty luck.
2313620	2315620	Oh shit. So I can spend ten points to
2315620	2317620	roll a d6
2317620	2319620	to reduce damage on that last attack.
2319620	2321620	Incredible.
2321620	2323620	Five. Fuck yeah. Holy shit.
2323620	2325620	Very well done.
2325620	2327620	So you're at five hit points and you feel
2327620	2329620	this water touching your skin
2329620	2331620	and all this fish guts
2331620	2333620	and blood and
2333620	2335620	viscera that is inside
2335620	2337620	of this fish and I need you to
2337620	2339620	roll an intelligence check for me.
2339620	2341620	Ooh.
2341620	2343620	He has a seventy five intelligence
2343620	2345620	and he rolls a thirty one. You remember
2345620	2347620	that the hole that Keith
2347620	2349620	blew into this giant
2349620	2351620	creature is on its
2351620	2353620	right side.
2353620	2355620	And you think by the way
2355620	2357620	that you were eaten
2357620	2359620	and then went down
2359620	2361620	Jude!
2361620	2363620	No!
2363620	2365620	That's gonna be on your
2365620	2367620	left side. That big hole
2367620	2369620	there. I pressed forward
2369620	2371620	into the fish.
2371620	2373620	And we will
2373620	2375620	make my way to that hole.
2375620	2377620	It's a badass scene in my head if you had known
2377620	2379620	that that's what was gonna happen
2379620	2381620	that you just go charging at its open mouth
2381620	2383620	and dive straight in.
2383620	2385620	That's exactly what happened listeners.
2385620	2387620	It was my plan all along.
2387620	2391620	It is the fishman's
2391620	2393620	turn. I feel like I haven't gone in a while.
2393620	2395620	Is that maybe the case?
2395620	2397620	You struggled with the uh...
2397620	2399620	By the fishman I meant Clark Bishop. It's Clark
2399620	2401620	Bishop's turn. Big Daddy just went
2401620	2403620	and swallowed John. Also his name is
2403620	2405620	Big Daddy. Big Dad!
2405620	2407620	You don't play video
2407620	2409620	games so. Oh I don't. What's that?
2409620	2411620	Bioshock. Oh cool.
2411620	2413620	You're in the aquatic realm though.
2413620	2415620	We're close. Sure.
2415620	2417620	He doesn't know it's a rip off.
2417620	2419620	I'll take it.
2419620	2421620	And so Clark Bishop
2421620	2423620	it is your turn indeed.
2423620	2425620	How does the action
2425620	2427620	economy work with picking up Keith?
2427620	2429620	Is it a whole action to do that?
2429620	2431620	We'll say yes.
2431620	2433620	But then you can still move with him.
2433620	2435620	But only one spot? Only one spot.
2435620	2437620	And the
2437620	2439620	fishman that's nearest me how's he looking
2439620	2441620	health wise? Have we touched him even?
2441620	2443620	A little bit but he looks pretty fresh.
2443620	2445620	Oh but you're free of him right? I'm free of him.
2445620	2447620	I can move now. I just worry about how fast
2447620	2449620	he can move. He can get all up
2449620	2451620	on us real quick. I'm gonna have to
2451620	2453620	I think look at the elevator.
2453620	2455620	How's it looking?
2455620	2457620	That's interesting because
2457620	2459620	the elevator
2459620	2461620	roll alertness.
2463620	2465620	I do not pass
2465620	2467620	a 72 on a 70.
2467620	2469620	You do not see anything or hear anything.
2469620	2471620	Alright I'm going to
2471620	2473620	pick up Keith and fire
2473620	2475620	the fishman. Alright. No movement.
2475620	2477620	If you're gonna pick up Keith on this one
2477620	2479620	I'm gonna give you a negative 20 on the firearms.
2479620	2481620	Okay. Alright go ahead and roll
2481620	2483620	firearms for me. So I
2483620	2485620	normally have 80 I'll be rolling on a 60.
2487620	2489620	Fuck! It's a 76
2489620	2491620	I would have passed but I don't pass.
2491620	2493620	You could roll you could spend 16
2493620	2495620	luck. I'm not gonna. I think you mean
2495620	2497620	luck.
2497620	2499620	John Lee Pettymore.
2499620	2501620	Holding his breath
2501620	2503620	and swimming downward into the
2503620	2505620	beast he John Lee Pettymore
2505620	2507620	is going to
2507620	2509620	release his remaining flash bang
2509620	2511620	and one of the smoke grenades
2511620	2513620	down into these guts as he like
2513620	2515620	swims out the hole. I'm gonna need
2515620	2517620	an athletics check in order
2517620	2519620	to properly
2519620	2521620	do this whole maneuver.
2521620	2523620	41
2523620	2525620	on a 50. Nice. Which I think is
2525620	2527620	exactly what I rolled last time on my
2527620	2529620	athletics check. You gave me
2529620	2531620	haunted dice Jeff.
2531620	2533620	We're bumping rolling doubles. It's weird.
2533620	2535620	It's real creepy I don't like it at all. Yeah I rolled
2535620	2537620	two eights in a row before the game even started
2537620	2539620	because I was rolling like a dumb ass.
2539620	2541620	Those would have come in handy Thomas.
2541620	2543620	Anyway
2543620	2545620	Anyway I passed.
2545620	2547620	Congratulations.
2547620	2549620	Thank you. You drop off
2549620	2551620	this flash and this
2551620	2553620	smoke and flash.
2553620	2555620	So the flash grenade is hopefully gonna
2555620	2557620	I mean it's a big concussive thing.
2557620	2559620	Hopefully that's gonna fuck up his
2559620	2561620	insides and while he's in
2561620	2563620	the water and then
2563620	2565620	if it doesn't
2565620	2567620	I hope the smoke grenade makes his tummy real
2567620	2569620	upset. Yeah no doubt.
2569620	2571620	Like if you swallowed a cherry bomb.
2571620	2573620	That would be so gross. I can't even
2573620	2575620	imagine what that would feel like.
2575620	2577620	Just like
2577620	2579620	like dry smoke
2579620	2581620	billowing through your soft insides.
2581620	2583620	What you have to do is implant
2583620	2585620	one into your guts and leave the fuse
2585620	2587620	sticking out of your belly button and then you can
2587620	2589620	light it. That's what the belly button is for.
2589620	2591620	That's what the pros do.
2593620	2595620	Yeah what do I do
2595620	2597620	to this fish man? Well I think you swim
2597620	2599620	out of it but you are now being
2599620	2601620	birthed out of the side
2601620	2603620	of this massive creature out of
2603620	2605620	the same hole
2605620	2607620	that Keith Vigna
2607620	2609620	came out of. Was once birthed from.
2609620	2611620	Previously and as you
2611620	2613620	as you
2613620	2615620	I think you're gonna have to get birthed from this fish thing.
2615620	2617620	To get on our
2617620	2619620	spiritual level. Otherwise
2619620	2621620	we're just gonna leave you in the dust.
2621620	2623620	Like on the astral plane.
2623620	2625620	As you
2625620	2627620	come out of it you feel this
2627620	2629620	other body follow you through
2629620	2631620	the hole and you begin to swim
2631620	2633620	out of the creature.
2633620	2635620	I hope it's just the corpse of that dude.
2635620	2637620	It doesn't sound like it's corpse. I guess it could have
2637620	2639620	just floated out.
2643620	2645620	Clark you got a fish man on you man.
2645620	2647620	Right now in this room.
2647620	2649620	There's one still
2649620	2651620	standing guard at the elevator and
2651620	2653620	the other one is standing right in front of
2653620	2655620	Clark Bishop and he is going
2655620	2657620	to attack you.
2657620	2659620	And he fucking
2659620	2661620	fails. Oh thank god. This is absurd.
2661620	2663620	This is absurd.
2663620	2665620	This is positively absurd. As soon as it
2665620	2667620	like pulls the scythe into position
2667620	2669620	to swing at you it kind of loses
2669620	2671620	grip of the thing and just kind of grabs
2671620	2673620	it on the end with one hand and then just
2673620	2675620	kind of swings it down at you and
2675620	2677620	the stick part just kind of hits you in the arm.
2677620	2679620	Yep.
2679620	2681620	That's it.
2681620	2683620	That's all that happens.
2683620	2685620	And the other one is going to
2685620	2687620	move closer
2687620	2689620	to the elevator door. With that it's
2689620	2691620	Clark Bishop's turn. Really?
2691620	2693620	Nope. I didn't
2693620	2695620	make an initiative tracker for
2695620	2697620	myself. I was like oh I can totally
2697620	2699620	do this by memory.
2699620	2701620	Nope. Thomas you
2701620	2703620	you hear a noise
2703620	2705620	as you come out of
2705620	2707620	this creature.
2707620	2709620	And as
2709620	2711620	you're swimming away
2711620	2713620	you feel something grip
2713620	2715620	one of your legs.
2715620	2717620	Nevermind Zach it was
2717620	2719620	my turn.
2731620	2733620	Thomas you're in this water
2733620	2735620	you just swam away from this
2735620	2737620	creature that you were birthed
2737620	2739620	out of and you feel
2739620	2741620	something grab your leg.
2741620	2743620	You turn around. No I
2743620	2745620	kick as hard as I can. You kick as hard
2745620	2747620	as you can. Go ahead and roll
2747620	2749620	unarmed combat.
2749620	2751620	80 on
2751620	2753620	a 40.
2753620	2755620	You kick as hard as you can and you feel
2755620	2757620	the restraint that your
2757620	2759620	leg has as if you
2759620	2761620	cannot move it at
2761620	2763620	all. I didn't sign up for no
2763620	2765620	water zombies.
2765620	2767620	Do you try to continue swimming or do
2767620	2769620	you turn and look? I turn
2769620	2771620	and look. When you turn and look
2771620	2773620	you can only see
2773620	2775620	the murky water that is
2775620	2777620	around you. You can't make out
2777620	2779620	where your leg is
2779620	2781620	in the water. The water
2781620	2783620	is too opaque
2783620	2785620	in its nastiness.
2785620	2787620	Okay so I grab back on whatever's
2787620	2789620	grabbing to me and try to pull myself
2789620	2791620	it. Okay like if it's a hand or something
2791620	2793620	I grab that wrist and yank myself
2793620	2795620	to it so I can see. Awesome.
2795620	2797620	Go ahead and roll unarmed combat again.
2799620	2801620	94.
2801620	2803620	Got another success.
2803620	2805620	You actually can use
2805620	2807620	your ankle as a steady point
2807620	2809620	a held point in this
2809620	2811620	water and you can move
2811620	2813620	your like doing a crunch
2813620	2815620	to grab at what is underneath
2815620	2817620	and you feel
2817620	2819620	nothing
2819620	2821620	on your legs, on your
2821620	2823620	feet but something unseen
2823620	2825620	is holding you in
2825620	2827620	place. I need you to roll a sanity
2827620	2829620	check.
2829620	2831620	90. Fail. You lose
2831620	2833620	and failed over my power. You lose
2833620	2835620	control of your
2835620	2837620	body and
2837620	2839620	you lose control
2839620	2841620	of your mind. You're gonna
2841620	2843620	lose one sanity and your
2843620	2845620	mind is splitting itself
2845620	2847620	away from your body. The John
2847620	2849620	Lee Pettymore part of you
2849620	2851620	and the physical Kevin
2851620	2853620	that you embody are at
2853620	2855620	odds. No this isn't right.
2855620	2857620	Where am I? What's going on
2857620	2859620	down here? That's happening in my mind.
2859620	2861620	John is starting to
2861620	2863620	wake up a little bit inside of Kevin
2863620	2865620	and he's forgotten a little bit. Yeah.
2865620	2867620	I need you to roll 4d6 for the
2867620	2869620	damage that you left
2869620	2871620	inside of this creature.
2871620	2873620	Good thing we just played tiny d6 for the Patreon.
2873620	2875620	Plenty of d6's to go around.
2875620	2877620	4 he said? 4.
2877620	2879620	3 6's
2879620	2881620	and a 2. Holy shit.
2881620	2883620	So you see this
2883620	2885620	absolute explosion.
2885620	2887620	It's like water shockwave
2887620	2889620	like wooo. Exactly.
2889620	2891620	And it actually it lights up
2891620	2893620	the murky water that you're in.
2893620	2895620	Looking down there is absolutely
2895620	2897620	nothing holding on to you but
2897620	2899620	swimming away
2899620	2901620	you do see there is a
2901620	2903620	little fish head about
2903620	2905620	the size of a softball
2905620	2907620	that is on a human
2907620	2909620	body the size of a Barbie
2909620	2911620	doll and it is
2911620	2913620	awkwardly swimming. Don't like
2913620	2915620	anything about that. I need you
2915620	2917620	to make a constitution
2917620	2919620	check because you've been in the
2919620	2921620	water for some time
2921620	2923620	and I looked up the rules
2923620	2925620	for suffocation.
2925620	2927620	Now you look up the rules.
2927620	2929620	36 on a
2929620	2931620	50. Alrighty.
2931620	2933620	So you only take 1 hit point of damage.
2933620	2935620	Okay that brings me down to 4. Oof.
2935620	2937620	Now I need you to roll a power
2937620	2939620	check.
2939620	2941620	Fail.
2941620	2943620	89 on a 60.
2943620	2945620	That hand that you felt
2945620	2947620	on your leg rips you
2947620	2949620	downward.
2949620	2951620	And you feel water just
2951620	2953620	rushing up your nose.
2953620	2955620	And I need you to roll another
2955620	2957620	constitution check.
2957620	2959620	36 pass.
2959620	2961620	Lose 1 more hit point of
2961620	2963620	damage. As we
2963620	2965620	roll for power again this
2965620	2967620	unseen force continues
2967620	2969620	to try to drag you to the bottom
2969620	2971620	of this tank. Maybe it wants to
2971620	2973620	take me someplace safe. Maybe it should just go with it.
2973620	2975620	It wants to take you someplace safe.
2975620	2977620	12 I pass.
2977620	2979620	21 I pass.
2979620	2981620	I need you to roll another
2981620	2983620	constitution check.
2983620	2985620	52 on a 60 I pass.
2985620	2987620	Lose another hit point of damage.
2987620	2989620	2.
2989620	2991620	2? Yeah that's what I meant.
2991620	2993620	Because you're down at 2 hit points we need to roll
2993620	2995620	constitution to see if you can stay
2995620	2997620	conscious.
2997620	2999620	No. 71 on
2999620	3001620	a 50. This unseen
3001620	3003620	force drags you and
3003620	3005620	drags you down to the bottom
3005620	3007620	and slams your body
3007620	3009620	up against
3009620	3011620	a hard surface.
3011620	3013620	Your eyes
3013620	3015620	open up
3015620	3017620	and in front of you on the
3017620	3019620	other side of this
3019620	3021620	glass
3021620	3023620	you see
3023620	3025620	Marvin staring
3025620	3027620	straight back at you.
3027620	3029620	You've been in his office before
3029620	3031620	and that is where he is standing.
3031620	3033620	And he
3033620	3035620	has his hand up
3035620	3037620	and the orifice on his face
3037620	3039620	tries its
3039620	3041620	hardest to make a smile
3041620	3043620	as your lungs
3043620	3045620	fill with water.
3045620	3047620	Glub.
3047620	3049620	So ends
3049620	3051620	John Lee Pettymore.
3071620	3073620	The only one
3073620	3075620	trying to
3075620	3077620	pull over
3077620	3079620	How can you
3079620	3081620	have enough
3081620	3083620	drowning out
3083620	3085620	of the noise
3087620	3089620	Cause nobody
3089620	3091620	knows
3091620	3093620	nobody
3093620	3095620	knows
3095620	3097620	nobody
3097620	3099620	knows
3099620	3101620	nobody
3101620	3103620	dies
