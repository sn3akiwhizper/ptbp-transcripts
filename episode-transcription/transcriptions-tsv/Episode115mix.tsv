0	2840	Greetings, friends.
2840	6160	It's your BFF, WTD.
6160	10160	BFF means beefy, funny friend.
10160	15160	And a WTD means wet-tongued doggy.
15480	17080	You're welcome.
17080	22080	TTYL, time to yell loudly.
22440	24640	There is a new howlin' with Wolf,
24640	29200	and that makes my nasty old heart always burst with love.
29240	32960	This howlin' with Wolf is from Distant Egg Song,
32960	36600	location, Houston, they write.
36600	40320	Thanks much to the trash slurpin' host with the most.
40320	44160	Always glad to hear your voice on the airwaves.
44160	48980	This goes out to Tamantha in St. Louis.
48980	52960	Hey, Vinnie, glad you turned me on to this podcast.
52960	55120	It made my 2020 better.
55120	59360	Regarding your question, I checked in Ma's recipe book.
59360	62280	The way to render the sacrificial,
62280	65400	purulent goo from a gamer's flesh
65400	69280	is to go low and slow for a minimum of eight hours.
69280	72080	Glad to see you and Vinnie and Galina.
72080	73920	Let's do it again soon.
73920	78080	Your brother from the Venuccia mother, Vinnie.
78080	82160	Mmm, damn, that recipe sounds
82200	87200	abso-fuckin'-lutely tasty, scrumptious, unctuous.
89440	92280	I must visit this all-mother
92280	96260	and exchange my forbidden recipes with them.
96260	97840	If you wanna write up somethin'
97840	101300	for your BFF forever, Wolf to Hal,
101300	103360	you can go fuck yourself.

131280	134640	V might be for vendetta to some folks,
134640	139640	but to me, V is for volumizing shampoo and conditioners.
140320	143600	And beginning next Friday, November 5th,
143600	146560	we will have a guest seated at the head of the table.

165040	169320	as he runs Joe, Luke, Thomas, and some idiot named Zack
169840	172240	through a classic Delta Green scenario.

175480	178200	And finally, get ready for ol' Wolfie
178200	180320	to be an absolute mess.
180320	183920	It's time to say goodbye to a brand new song.
183920	187400	This premiere will be the last time I play it here
187400	192400	on the main feed of 694.2 PTBP.
192480	195240	So if you want to hear this infant baby
195240	197400	of a banger ever again,
197400	200760	you actually have tons of options.
200760	205280	One of which is just Google cuts you with no backbone.
235880	238040	Luke, you have a question for Justin?
238040	241280	Oh yeah, did you see the article came out today
241280	244640	or just the story of Chokin'?
244640	245480	No.
245480	247060	Yeah, Chokin' on Deez Nuts.
248880	249880	Got him!
249880	250720	He didn't get him.
250720	251560	He didn't say Chokin'.
251560	252380	He didn't say it.
252380	254640	Yeah, but I did.
254640	255480	I got you.
255480	256320	Yeah, he got you.
256320	257720	He got you to say Chokin' on Deez Nuts.
257720	259680	Yeah, I got you to say it.

266040	266880	I got got.
266880	267700	Thanks, Joe.
269240	272600	Someone in the UX industry, user experience industry
272600	275280	was telling me that like a lot of people she works with
275280	277240	no longer use Photoshop.
277240	279320	They use a program called Figma.
281440	286440	And I just had to like, be like, yeah, wow, interesting.
287000	290660	Because it's not a person I could say Figma balls to.
294680	296120	You know what?
296120	300760	We fucked around pretty hard last time.
300760	305320	And then it took us a long time to get into the questions.
305320	308460	And this time took a long time for y'all to find out.
309800	311080	I have a bad story first.
311080	311920	You want to hear it?
311920	312740	I do want to hear it.
312740	313580	Let's fuck around.
313580	315800	Let's fuck around.
315800	318080	So whenever we were clapping,
318080	321160	I forgot that I had stabbed my hand with a steak knife
321160	323120	earlier this week.
323440	324640	Why did you do that?
324640	325480	Oh, wow.
325480	326540	I have a hole in my hand.
326540	327380	Shit.
327380	328200	Wait, I didn't see it.
328200	330520	So that first clap, I clapped and like almost went.
331520	334120	Yeah, show us your hand hole again, please.
334120	335240	It's hard to see.
335240	336080	Hold it over to the screen.
336080	338040	It's like, Zach doesn't know how to use Windows.
338040	339360	Yeah, oh.
339360	340180	How'd you do that?
340180	341640	It doesn't look that bad.
341640	342480	It's deep.
345720	348760	I was trying to split two hash browns apart
348760	350600	that were frozen with a steak knife.
350720	354840	And I was holding them in my hand
354840	359840	where the knife, when it pierced through, would stab me.
359880	363160	And I literally went, I shouldn't be doing this.
363160	365720	And as I said that, it's spiraling.
365720	366960	Nice.
366960	369040	Like without much pressure at all.
369040	372280	And I just like stabbed into my hand
372280	373880	and I just was like, oh man.
374760	377960	The fact that you were sober when you did this.
377960	380060	Oh, it was an afternoon, yeah.
381080	384000	So you were drinking for a few hours at that point.
384000	387960	I'd been gone for hours, you know, a Tuesday afternoon.
387960	388840	Yeah, Tuesday afternoon.
388840	390920	So this is, you woke up and this was like
390920	392680	a midnight snack, almost.
394040	396800	And yeah, and luckily I was okay,
396800	400580	but I did see some hand chicken meat, as I like to call it.
400580	404240	Cause if you've ever like sliced chicken,
404240	406080	where it like kind of the muscle kind of split,
406080	407720	I did a little bit of that,
407720	409160	which was very fun to look at.
409160	411520	And I was like, oh man, that's bad.
411520	414520	You guys make chicken different than I do.
414520	416320	You ever split your chicken meat, bro?
416320	418200	You might not have seen the inside of your hand.
418200	419120	It's chickeny.
419120	419960	Oh.
421240	423960	Have you ever seen the inside of your body?
423960	425680	Yeah, yeah.
425680	427700	Yeah, I've had some x-rays done.
427700	429880	I suppose I've seen the inside of my body.
429880	430800	Technically, yeah.
430800	431640	Yeah.
431640	434040	I go with Zach to his colonoscopy and take a gander.
434040	435860	Yeah, I do want it.
435860	437280	I'm Zach's second opinion.
437280	440040	I'm like, nah, I think there's something wrong.
440040	441880	That looks, doesn't look normal.
441880	442720	Pollip.
443920	444760	It's a pollip.
444760	447000	That's a pollip. Is that a Pokemon?
447000	447900	That's so cute.
447900	448740	Yeah.
449640	453820	Sir, it's, we try to get the patients as clean as possible,
453820	454960	but it's clearly shit.
454960	456200	You can see the corn.
457280	458360	Yeah, that's a pollip.
459320	460200	Wake him up, tell him.
460200	461040	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
461040	463440	You gotta wake him up because they put you in a daze.
463440	466240	It's a real a pollip of daisy.
466280	467120	Oh my God.
467120	468520	Pollip of daisy.
470200	471040	What?
471040	471860	Do we have any questions?
471860	472700	All of them.
474540	477240	The bollard asks, what the fuck?
477240	478200	Fuck you too.
482840	484840	I think what the fuck is an appropriate question.
484840	486760	Yeah, that was my first question to you.
486760	487680	To what we've done.
487680	490160	When you stop the recording, it's the last episode.
490160	491000	Oh yeah.
491000	491820	I think that's what I said.
491820	493840	I think that is what you said at the end of season one.
493840	495160	The fuck?
495160	497440	I mean, it's just a small town mystery.
497440	499680	Just a small town mystery.
504360	508040	They also asked, will we ever find out the backstory
508040	509800	of Wolf the dog?
509800	512080	I mean, we've had at least a-
512080	512920	There's a little bit.
512920	514240	We learned a little bit.
514240	516840	If you can, if you're, you know.
516840	517680	If you're smart.
517680	519720	Pretty clever, but yeah, you can,
519720	521160	all of Wolf the dog is in there.
521160	523160	So go back, re-listen, get those numbers up.
523200	525920	Definitely re-listen and get those numbers up.
525920	528760	Actually, at the Patreon $100 tier,
528760	531520	I will call you on Discord and tell you.
531520	533520	You have to be subscribed for two years.
535520	539360	It's patreon.com slash Justin wants money.
540480	543520	Yeah, alternatively, you can Venmo Justin $200.
545960	550960	If you listen to the 694.2 PTBP Pledge Drive episode,
550960	555960	you can see at least the story of Wolf the dog.
556840	559200	Yeah, there's some slight origin story in there.
559200	561040	That's how he comes into the studio.
561040	563320	He's a great DJ who loves eating trash
563320	565240	and I don't know why it needs to be any more than that.
565240	566080	Yup.
566960	569840	Celery Top asks, to do hakenu.
569840	572080	To do hakenu to you as well, son.
573560	575280	Nerds, cling as they cling on.
575280	577400	To do hakenu are true words of power,
577440	579680	but how did you come up with vis-a-girl
579680	581760	and shuck-a-tee-felicia?
581760	582880	Asked and answered.
582880	583720	Asked and answered.
583720	585040	We went over this one last time,
585040	587920	but hey, Celery Top, we like what you do.
587920	588760	You've done some sick art.
588760	591400	Exactly, pasted it again in the Google document.
591400	595920	I think Celery Top did the Contention Trucks artwork,
595920	599360	which is fucking rad, yeah.
599360	602360	Abadfeeling asks, question,
602360	604960	what was up with the feet eating?
604960	606160	I'm curious about that too.
606200	608800	No, I was gonna ask you, Joe, if you had an idea.
608800	610120	My only theory,
610120	611800	and I don't know if these guys know this yet,
611800	614880	that was how I was introduced to that light plane world
614880	617400	with the jibugabuntubus, and-
617400	618240	You can say it.
618240	619600	It was a jagant umbropithecus.
619600	623120	It was a xenonimatoh that they attached to my foot
623120	624280	to send me there.
624280	626200	And so I assume it's maybe covering up evidence
626200	627640	of those scars on,
627640	630200	he kept mentioning that scar on my foot.
630200	632200	I assume it was maybe covering that up in some way,
632200	635200	but I wasn't sure why they needed to consume it.
635240	636480	I didn't know what was up with that.
636480	637800	They had to do it.
637800	638640	All right.
638640	643120	And I mean, did you have a reason at the time
643120	644520	beyond it's real spooky?
644520	646680	Yes, it was simply what Joe said,
646680	648900	that it is a thing that shows
648900	650840	that you have been at the circle of knowledge.
650840	653120	And if you were a Delta Green agent
653120	654640	and you were like cleaning up
654640	656720	after like a mission or something,
656720	659160	and one of the parts of the mission
659160	662840	was that certain people had this crazy scar
662840	664600	on the bottom of their left foot,
664880	666960	then yeah, you'd cut it off and-
666960	667800	Feed it to them.
668800	669640	Like you do.
669640	672480	Okay, but Chief Maggie Cook had some serious issues
672480	674140	with James the Mill Worker specifically,
674140	675800	because James the Mill Worker
675800	678200	clearly had issues with Chief Maggie Cook
678200	679680	and his own blood,
679680	682160	if you would have tested the blood at his house
682160	684420	that spelled out stop her,
684420	685920	that was James the Mill Worker's blood
685920	688640	because he knew that Chief Maggie Cook
688640	691200	was going down this dark path.
691200	694080	Hold on, tested with the Advanced Crime Lab
694520	696820	at the contention police station?
696820	697660	Yeah.
697660	699980	Drew Andrews is a-
699980	700820	Vampire.
700820	703680	He's a vampire and you just give him a little blood.
703680	704520	I forgot about it.
704520	705440	He licks it.
705440	706280	He laps it up.
706280	707560	And then he goes,
707560	710640	and his head vibrates and shakes around
710640	712080	and then he blows blood.
712080	714600	James the Mill Worker's blood.
714600	716880	And then he tells you who's blood it was.
716880	718840	We kept forgetting to take advantage of that.
718840	720240	You guys are idiots.
720240	722560	Compliment and question from a bad feeling,
722560	725440	the various theme songs for the show's various arcs
725440	728500	strike me as something very cool this show does
728500	733500	that other TTRPG podcasts don't do.
733580	735620	Will this continue in season two?
735620	736460	Yes.
736460	737600	Any bangers picked out yet?
739120	739960	No bangers.
739960	740920	No bangers picked out.
740920	742280	Circling some?
742280	743120	We're circling.
743120	744360	We're circling.
744360	748400	How did you pick the songs and where did you find them?
748400	752060	We chose the song so far from bands
752420	755620	that either we know or have seen live.
755620	757500	Yeah, Springfield bands for the most part.
757500	760100	Springfield bands that we're into, yeah.
760100	761780	Connected to the region at the least, yeah.
761780	762700	For sure.
762700	765760	Justin and I were in a band
765760	769500	and we played with Blue False Indigo
769500	772580	and that's kind of how we met them
772580	774580	and who else was on the show?
775580	777340	We played with Dream Girl and Kudzu before too.
777340	778540	That's right, yeah.
778580	783180	And Kudzu, who you might know from a song
783180	784860	that we've used a couple of times on the show
784860	788300	called No Backbone, the lead singer of that band
788300	791060	is a very good promoter in Springfield
791060	793220	who always makes sure that bands coming through
793220	794760	are well taken care of,
794760	796340	that they have a good place to sleep
796340	797540	and that they get paid.
797540	800900	So we were happy to promote Kudzu, yeah,
800900	803200	which No Backbone's a fucking banger.
803200	804580	The rest of the songs, I mean,
804580	806420	we've got Someone Still Loves You, Boris Yeltsin,
806420	809880	who's just a fucking staple of the Springfield scene.
809880	813060	We've all seen them countless times, I would imagine.
813060	813900	More than any other band.
813900	816740	Joe and I's band have played with them a couple of times,
816740	819700	not to dunk on y'all's bands.
820980	822780	And then who else do we have?
822780	826740	Grady P. Drug, who is just an excellent musician.
826740	829500	We saw him a couple of weekends ago actually
829500	831540	and he was phenomenal.
831540	834300	A Dragon in Three, which is an offshoot
834300	836820	of Someone Still Loves You, Boris Yeltsin, yeah.
836820	839920	And they are an incredible little outfit
839920	843240	who I am always stoked to throw them on.
843240	846340	And I'm looking forward to new music from them, hopefully.
846340	848260	Creek Rocks are some friends of mine
848260	849980	and they've got a residency right now
849980	851220	down in Silver Dollar City.
851220	852540	Oh, no shit.
852540	853380	Go check them out.
853380	854860	That's super rad.
854860	855980	That's probably coming to an end soon
855980	856820	as the weather changes.
856820	859060	I think they play in an outdoor amphitheater, but yeah.
859060	861080	Creek Rocks, that song rules.
861080	862620	We've been really happy, I think,
862620	864180	with all the songs that we've been able to play.
864940	865780	Do they have any pants left?
865780	866620	To throw on the show.
867580	871380	Wow, that is a deep cut from Luke talking about...
871380	872800	There's a ride at Silver Dollar City
872800	874020	called Fire in the Hole.
874020	876100	Oh, yes, I should have got it.
876100	877140	God dang it.
877140	879500	And as you go through this ride,
879500	880820	Luke, do you want to describe?
880820	882940	Yeah, it's called, did you say what it's called?
882940	884600	It's called Fire in the Hole.
884600	887160	And you ride through and basically
887160	888860	you just see a bunch of stuff.
888860	890660	Like you see, is that the same one
890660	891860	with like a prison escape or something?
891860	892700	Oh, yeah.
892700	893740	It's a town on fire.
894620	897500	And the town is lit on fire by the...
897500	898700	Bald Knobbers. Bald Knobbers.
898700	901340	But they don't just light towns on fire, no.
901340	903900	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
903900	904740	At a certain...
904740	908740	Yeah, I just hope you don't have any pants lying around.
908740	909580	Why is that, Luke?
909580	913340	Oh, because at one point in the ride you see a home.
913340	915020	A home that is on fire.
915020	916940	That's on fire and one of the guys
916940	918580	is getting out of the home.
918580	919700	He's hanging out the window.
919700	920780	And she says...
920780	922580	And he's wearing his long underwear.
923540	924380	His nighttime clothes.
924380	926780	And she says, whatever your name is,
926780	928420	it's whatever his name is.
928420	930500	Whatever your name is, get back in here
930500	931980	and put on your pants.
931980	932820	And he goes...
932820	933640	And he says...
933640	935020	I can't put on my pants.
935020	937860	I ain't got no pants no more.
937860	940620	The dang Bald Knobbers stole them.
940620	942560	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
942560	944660	So that's just some local humor.
944660	945980	We're trying to get local work.
945980	950980	And blank a patch, shout out to blank a patch
951420	952780	from NerdPoker.
952780	957500	All right, so what was the fucking question?
957500	958500	How do you pick the songs?
958500	959340	Oh yeah, that was it.
959340	960180	We answered it, good.
960180	961060	Moving on.
961060	964380	Black Moxa asks, congratulations.
964380	965660	Oh, that's, thanks.
965660	969300	Congratulations on excellent work across two continents.
969300	970140	Thank you.
970140	970960	Thank you.
970960	972300	It was across three at one point,
972300	973540	which I was super proud of
973540	975460	when we had Scott Dorward playing with us.
975460	977540	I bragged about that to people in my life
977540	980380	that we were playing a game across three continents.
980620	981460	That was cool.
981460	982280	That was dope.
982280	983120	That was rad.
983120	984320	We're cool as fuck.
985940	988480	So were the time loops and resets
988480	990320	always part of your story?
990320	991160	We're the coolest people who do this.
991160	991980	No.
995380	996980	Or did you have to introduce them
996980	999900	after the characters got into impossible situations?
999900	1000900	Yes.
1000900	1001940	Also, how...
1001940	1003100	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
1003100	1005780	Did the characters get into impossible situations
1005780	1008780	or did little Zachy get into an impossible situation?
1008780	1010260	Yes, also yes.
1011100	1012020	Very much yes.
1012020	1015580	It was my doing that I had opened up the story
1015580	1017980	to too many avenues.
1017980	1019120	And I thought to myself,
1019120	1021960	how will I take them down these avenues?
1021960	1023060	And then I thought, well...
1023060	1025520	Time travel, the greatest cop out of them all.
1027200	1029060	And the easiest to handle.
1029060	1030780	Exactly, famously.
1030780	1035540	I have this future version of one of Joe's characters
1035540	1038780	that I can play with who might be able to do some stuff.
1038780	1040420	Yeah, fucking nightmare, honestly.
1040420	1041580	Never gonna do it again.
1041580	1045000	And also, how is the create-a-campaign
1045000	1047500	this community contributed to going?
1047500	1048580	Fantastic question.
1048580	1049500	Yeah, it's a great question.
1049500	1050920	It's going really well.
1050920	1054820	Frankie and, no, no, no, no, no, no, hang on,
1054820	1058400	have compiled everything that everyone has written
1058400	1062140	and voted on up into one document
1062140	1067140	and it is slowly being whittled down into a playable game.
1067780	1072780	And it'll be out in, oh, what, 2031.
1073180	1074020	Yeah.
1074020	1075380	It'll be playable.
1075380	1076940	Let's not put it that close.
1076940	1078540	Okay, yeah.
1078540	1081380	We were shooting for the 10th anniversary of the finale.
1081380	1084140	Yeah, let's push that right now, actually.
1084140	1085940	2053.
1085940	1088820	Yeah, no, that campaign is dope.
1088820	1092660	And if these guys have forgotten enough
1092660	1094180	of what they might've read
1094180	1096820	from what people wrote about that campaign,
1097340	1099180	I would definitely be interested
1099180	1100940	in running some form of that.
1100940	1102240	I purposely didn't read a lot of it
1102240	1104340	because I thought we played it at some point.
1104340	1107060	Hey, guys, it's really fucking scary and cool.
1107060	1110060	So I would be interested in using,
1110060	1113280	maybe even just using parts of it to create a one-shot.
1113280	1114120	What's up, Thomas?
1114120	1115420	This is the first time I've even heard of it.
1115420	1116740	Oh, right, perfect.
1116740	1117820	The modest light.
1118880	1120660	I've read as much as Thomas has.
1120660	1121820	I knew about it.
1122340	1126220	The modest light says,
1126220	1127820	thanks for doing such great work.
1127820	1128820	Hey, thanks.
1128820	1130140	Honestly, it's been great
1130140	1132100	just listening to you guys improv together.
1132100	1134500	I felt like I've learned a lot
1134500	1137540	about how to keep the jokes rolling in my own life
1138420	1142740	just by analyzing how you all do it.
1142740	1143580	Sit you on a bad path.
1143580	1144620	Dangerous ground.
1144620	1146300	Yeah, you're on thin ice, my friend.
1146300	1149620	And let me tell you,
1149660	1151500	you better walk back right now
1151500	1153960	for the sake of your relationships.
1153960	1154800	Yeah.
1154800	1155620	You don't want this.
1155620	1156460	And your career.
1156460	1157300	You don't want this.
1157300	1158580	And a future podcast editor.
1158580	1159540	We don't do this.
1159540	1160380	Right.
1160380	1161620	Yeah, all six of us have,
1161620	1163940	or there's five of us, I have no, no.
1163940	1168300	You okay?
1168300	1172300	All five of us have four friends, so maybe two of them.
1173540	1177660	My dude, I literally was answering that question.
1177660	1179740	Like, I was like, well, wait,
1179740	1181540	let's talk about what we mean by friends
1181540	1183380	because I have four friends.
1185940	1187820	I have tons of people that I like
1187820	1189180	and that I'll talk to in public.
1189180	1190980	It's the people on the pod, yeah.
1194540	1199180	How did you guys know it was a good idea to start a podcast?
1199180	1201020	And did you have any fears going in?
1201020	1203380	These are the two questions.
1203380	1205260	I was the one who brought it up, right?
1205260	1206100	Probably, for sure.
1206100	1207180	Yeah, you've been wanting to do it for a while
1207620	1209100	and I don't know if that just stemmed out of the idea
1209100	1213300	of recording the games themselves to listen back to.
1213300	1216020	But we also, we were all listening
1216020	1217820	to a bunch of role-playing podcasts.
1217820	1218660	We were.
1218660	1220180	And when I listened to a lot of music,
1220180	1221460	I thought I could play music.
1221460	1223820	And when I listened to a lot of actual play podcasts,
1223820	1225580	I thought I could do that too, so.
1225580	1227580	The thing about the actual play podcast
1227580	1229780	is that we were getting together every week
1229780	1232540	and being as funny or funnier than them.
1234780	1235940	We're like, why not record it?
1235940	1238260	At least enough that we thought we could do this.
1238260	1241380	Yeah, it was enough to where when I brought it up,
1241380	1243940	no one balked at the idea, except for Taylor,
1243940	1247100	who was like, all right, this is my cue to bail.
1247100	1248180	Yeah.
1248180	1249020	We felt good.
1249020	1249860	We all felt good playing together
1249860	1252340	and we thought it might translate.
1252340	1255180	We honestly didn't expect this.
1255180	1256340	No, not at all.
1256340	1258140	Thomas is shaking his head like I did.
1258140	1259500	I did.
1259500	1261780	He was shaking his head, no,
1261780	1263900	don't put a nod in his mouth.
1266540	1267380	Ooh.
1269820	1270660	These nuts.
1270660	1272180	Did you guys, you guys didn't have any fears?
1272180	1273860	No, I didn't.
1273860	1275220	Going in, I definitely did.
1275220	1278180	But like after the first session, I was fine.
1278180	1280580	Do you guys have any fears now?
1280580	1281940	Oh yeah, there's so much more to lose.
1281940	1282780	One fear.
1282780	1285300	Yeah, my fear, my biggest fear is success.
1287460	1291020	When we first hit record and when we slipped into it
1291020	1293020	and we finally found that we were just playing
1293020	1295180	at a table together, my fears were allayed.
1295580	1297620	I remember that we have fun doing it either way.
1297620	1298460	That's right.
1298460	1299300	Exactly.
1299300	1301140	And it helps we didn't release it for so long.
1301140	1301980	Yes.
1301980	1303220	We kind of touched a bit.
1303220	1305220	So that was on that stream the other night.
1305220	1306780	The stream the other night, yeah, yeah.
1306780	1309940	But we, yeah, because we did record so many episodes
1309940	1312980	before releasing them, it really did allow us
1312980	1317540	to just put the game we were playing on the air.
1317540	1319940	We were very comfortable with what we were doing
1319940	1322140	at that point because it was just the same thing
1322140	1323180	we'd always done, kind of.
1323180	1324020	Yeah.
1324020	1326300	I think that's a smart way to do any creative thing
1326300	1328420	like that is to build up a little bit
1328420	1331260	and then start releasing it so you're not scared
1331260	1335020	immediately from poor results after one thing.
1335020	1335860	It's like edging.
1335860	1337420	How do you feel about edging, Justin?
1337420	1338860	It's the only way.
1338860	1342220	Brenner Nunez says, what was the balloon shirt?
1347340	1351460	To quote the great Nicole Byer, I don't want to edge.
1351460	1353940	If you start fucking me, you better make me cum.
1361060	1364260	She went on Punch Up the Jam and she punched up the jam.
1364260	1366700	She was on it.
1366700	1370540	Bruno Nunez asks, what was the balloon shaped head kid
1370540	1372500	from the JLP the Third Flashback?
1372500	1376660	I mentioned a balloon shaped headed kid multiple times.
1376660	1377740	He had very dark eyes.
1377740	1378940	Who was it, Joe?
1378940	1380900	It was Pastor Adam Kane.
1380900	1383140	It was Pastor Adam Kane as a child.
1383140	1385700	When we were listening to the episodes in real time
1385700	1388700	and I got to my flashback, I had already
1388700	1391860	played at that point a scene with Pastor Adam Kane
1391860	1394820	and he described him exactly the same way.
1394820	1396900	And I texted Zach, you son of a bitch.
1396900	1400700	I know who the balloon head kid is.
1400700	1401740	Yeah, that was a fun one.
1401740	1405500	I thought you were just dunking on that poor kid.
1405500	1407380	This balloon headed mommy stuck kid.
1407380	1409860	So there's this balloon headed idiot next year.
1409860	1411180	Did you have a flashback with him
1411180	1412740	or was that just a mistake on their part?
1412740	1415580	That is from the flashback of his father,
1415580	1419260	John Lee Pettymore the Third, burning down the Kane home.
1419260	1421220	When you put on the watch.
1421220	1422780	Yeah, when John put on the watch,
1422780	1427380	he saw his dad rescue him is one way of saying it.
1427380	1430380	Steal him and burn down the house of his family
1430380	1432020	is another way of saying it.
1432020	1435020	The gherkin at Merlin's Merkin says,
1436020	1442420	he says, will sweet boy Justin be a regular for season two
1442420	1445140	or will he be banished back into the pit
1445140	1449340	from whence he came until another uncle PC is introduced?
1449340	1451180	The pit, the pit.
1451180	1452900	Zach said I can't come out of the pit.
1452900	1455660	Yeah, he's going to be, he's an uncle.
1455660	1458260	He's an uncle forever.
1458260	1461420	No, but we talked about that and it's just
1461420	1464620	my schedule is going to be so freaking wacky with grad school
1464620	1467900	crap, especially when we're going to start recording it.
1467900	1470260	He already does side characters.
1470260	1472220	He already makes all the music.
1472220	1473060	You guys asked too much from him.
1473060	1475380	And he's trying to escape from that pit.
1475380	1477780	I'm trying, please.
1477780	1479740	And Zach keeps putting, like digging,
1479740	1480940	Zach's down there with me digging it.
1480940	1482820	He keeps sending more grad school assignments down there
1482820	1485460	and he's like, ah, you want to finish, don't you?
1485460	1488700	No, but I think being a regular on top of all the extra stuff
1488700	1491980	would for me right now would be just a little bit too much.
1492020	1495140	Even though I've had a blast.
1495140	1497260	If you do all my assignments, you'll
1497260	1500180	finally earn your Zachster's degree one of these days.
1500180	1502540	What'd you say?
1502540	1507260	Alexia says, I love this format where I can just immediately
1507260	1510340	move on to something else.
1510340	1513580	Alexia says, thank you for making this amazing show.
1513580	1514620	Thanks.
1514620	1517700	It's been such a light these months.
1517700	1519140	Thanks.
1519140	1520340	You're welcome.
1520340	1524500	Question, how do you manage to find so many amazing bands
1524500	1525540	local to you?
1525540	1527700	Well, it all dates back to the Ozarks Jubilee.
1527700	1529900	You see?
1529900	1531420	That's not, that's kind of a joke.
1531420	1532100	That's also true.
1532100	1532780	It's also true.
1532780	1534380	It has a really cool musical history.
1534380	1536300	And it's just been full of musical talent.
1536300	1539100	We've had a burgeoning musical scene forever.
1539100	1541380	And exactly, it does go back to the Jubilee.
1541380	1543900	I saw this question earlier on.
1543900	1545940	And I wanted to plug, there's a documentary out there
1545940	1546420	right now.
1546420	1549060	You can find it on thecenterofnowhere.com.
1549060	1551620	And it's kind of about the history of Springfield music.
1551620	1552700	It used to be on Amazon.
1552700	1554140	But I think they had some weird thing where
1554140	1555780	they took a bunch of documentaries down.
1555780	1557300	But you can find it on that website.
1557300	1558700	They're trying to hide the truth.
1558700	1562100	They want to silence the truth of the Springfield music scene.
1562100	1563900	Well, I also think, I don't know.
1563900	1567380	Zach, did your parents also take you to a bunch of musical stuff?
1567380	1569340	Because your parents do music stuff.
1569340	1570580	And mine do.
1570580	1572740	And Joe's do also.
1572740	1573340	Yeah.
1573340	1574740	My parents tried to make it.
1574740	1576000	They put out a cassette.
1576000	1579760	And they moved to Nashville before they had kids.
1579760	1582640	And put out a Christian cassette tape.
1582640	1585200	And opened up for some notable acts.
1585200	1589080	But neither one of them have Grammys.
1589080	1591120	Switchfoot.
1591120	1591920	Oh, yeah.
1591920	1593840	Does anybody's dad here have a Grammy?
1593840	1594340	Yeah.
1601040	1602400	He's like, my dad's a good old.
1602400	1603740	I was like, you have to explain.
1603740	1605080	He's a good, good piano player.
1605080	1606440	He's a really good piano player.
1606440	1608680	He's on an album that won Grammy.
1608680	1611040	Or it was a folk album of the year, I believe it was.
1611040	1613480	We should make our dads do a battle of the pianos
1613480	1614400	against each other.
1614400	1615760	My dad would kick your dad's ass.
1615760	1616800	Yeah, I'm sorry, Justin.
1616800	1618280	But my dad's a really nice guy.
1621040	1623040	He has a degree in composition.
1623040	1623760	Music composition.
1623760	1624640	What has he composed?
1624640	1625140	Yeah.
1625140	1625720	A cassette tape?
1625720	1626220	Yeah.
1626220	1626720	Yeah.
1626720	1630960	He put out a one hit, not so much of a one-two.
1630960	1631720	Have you heard it?
1631720	1632840	He's a great dad, though.
1632840	1634560	So good on him.
1634560	1637640	Moving on, we found so many amazing local bands
1637640	1640640	because there's so many amazing local bands around.
1640640	1642600	We've got an embarrassment of riches around us.
1642600	1643200	We really do.
1643200	1645560	And also, throw yourself into the music scene
1645560	1646760	in whatever town you're in.
1646760	1648040	Because it's probably got good music.
1648040	1650200	Yeah, I'm sure you're going to find something that you like.
1650200	1651960	Also, it's really easy for people
1651960	1653520	to record music these days.
1653520	1655520	And so more people are making it.
1655520	1660320	And there's a lot of garbage out there that you can step through.
1660320	1662540	Want to go somewhere says question.
1662540	1665020	Every time the boys woke up back in the cemetery,
1665020	1667900	was there another group of them running around
1667900	1669460	in the same city?
1669460	1670180	Yes.
1670180	1672140	Or was that an alternate timeline?
1672140	1672820	Yes.
1672820	1673780	Alternate universe.
1673780	1675260	Yes kind of thing.
1675260	1678460	So A, yes, there was an alternate version of them
1678460	1679860	in that scenario.
1679860	1683540	But in, for instance, the iteration
1683540	1686260	where you guys went to the Glass Family Compound,
1686260	1689880	that world continues on and keeps doing its own thing.
1689880	1691880	The next time you come back, you're
1691880	1695120	in a different iteration of that same plane.
1695120	1698000	But you've done what you did previously before.
1698000	1698880	Does that make sense?
1698880	1702360	Yeah, I do get that sort of, so our guys are doing it?
1702360	1704280	Yeah, so in the first one that you were in,
1704280	1705320	there's only one of you.
1705320	1707040	In the second one that you woke up in,
1707040	1708520	there's two of you in that world.
1708520	1710680	In the third one you woke up in, there's three of you
1710680	1711480	in that world.
1711480	1712440	Three collective yous.
1712440	1712960	Yeah.
1712960	1714440	And then in the last one, there's
1714440	1717000	four of you in that collective universe.
1717000	1720400	Well, there's not because you died in the CSU arc.
1720400	1723360	But yeah, that was my idea with all that.
1723360	1724880	We got another question here.
1724880	1728560	What up with the names branded into their skin
1728560	1730620	when they wake up at the cemetery?
1730620	1734800	Was it an overseer hint on where they need to go next?
1734800	1735440	Yes.
1735440	1737200	Or was it something more than that?
1737200	1740520	It was also a little bit more than that, but barely.
1740520	1743900	It was simply that when you interact
1743900	1748220	with the person who is branded on your body as a whole,
1748220	1750820	your group will have that name crossed out.
1750820	1752480	The next time you wake up and you only
1752480	1755380	have until all your names are crossed out,
1755380	1757480	then you have one last time to go through it.
1757480	1759700	So first time you had one name crossed out.
1759700	1762020	Second time you had the second name crossed out.
1762020	1765580	Third time you ran into both Tildy B. Mitchell
1765580	1769020	because Keith ran into Tildy B. Mitchell, Andrew Andrews,
1769020	1770980	and therefore crossed out both of those names,
1770980	1773860	giving you only one more chance at life.
1773860	1774860	Thank goodness.
1774860	1777340	Yeah, it worked out really fucking well, actually.
1777340	1779380	So it was just the overseer saying, hey,
1779380	1780500	you need to talk to these guys.
1780500	1782100	But he was just hoping that you would figure out
1782100	1782940	what you needed from him.
1782940	1783620	Yes.
1783620	1785140	Yeah, that was his.
1785140	1788660	Again, that's what I intended for sure.
1788660	1789740	Good, good, good, good.
1789740	1790860	That's what I was hoping.
1790860	1795460	Punk-ass book jockey, that's a great name, Compliments.
1795460	1796940	I love the way, this is long.
1796940	1799180	I love the way you created horror
1799220	1802500	by constantly throwing new mysteries and problems
1802500	1804620	and gross shit into the plot.
1804620	1807860	Instead of being scary because of slowly built tension,
1807860	1811260	it was scary from being completely overwhelming,
1811260	1813020	like it was a mental breakdown.
1813020	1813860	It was.
1815660	1817340	Yeah, very cool inversion.
1817340	1819940	I love that you wrote a time travel plot
1819940	1823060	and still held characters and plot elements
1823060	1826340	so loosely and let unexpected things happen.
1826340	1828140	Yeah, that was really fucking hard.
1828380	1830220	I loved how great everyone was
1830220	1832780	at instantly bringing each new character to life.
1832780	1834740	That's just good for you guys.
1834740	1835580	Thank you.
1835580	1838100	I love the way the players play
1838100	1840980	like they are horror movie characters.
1840980	1843940	Yes, again, thank you that I agree with that.
1843940	1845820	Thank you for doing it.
1845820	1846940	I thought it was great
1846940	1849220	that no matter how tangled everything got,
1849220	1853060	it always felt like there was an explanation for everything.
1853060	1855140	If we could just understand.
1855140	1857660	That's the amazing illusion Zach creates.
1858140	1860620	I mean, your trust means everything to me.
1860620	1863620	I love that when the players were given complete freedom
1863620	1866580	in the final episodes, they kept topping,
1866580	1867500	lol, lol,
1868820	1871540	each unbelievably cool thing they did
1871540	1874220	with another unbelievably cool thing.
1874220	1875060	Thanks.
1875060	1875900	Thank you, yeah.
1875900	1877140	It felt cool at the end there, man.
1877140	1878660	We all kind of felt like our power is unlocked.
1878660	1880340	We're all just topping.
1880340	1881180	And for you guys,
1881180	1883700	what one thing do you wish you had done different?
1883700	1887220	So they're saying, having done such cool stuff,
1887620	1890060	what was the one thing you wish you had done differently
1890060	1891620	as your character?
1891620	1893060	I don't know if I would have changed this,
1893060	1894780	but I would have been super curious
1894780	1897060	how the whole thing would have gone if I'd gone with Leon.
1897060	1898740	That really was a fork in the road
1898740	1900340	that could have drastically changed
1900340	1901300	the way this whole thing went.
1901300	1903580	Yep, I have no idea what would have happened.
1903580	1905660	If I wouldn't have jumped out of the bus,
1905660	1907340	I would want to see what happened then.
1907340	1908180	Ah, yes.
1908180	1909020	Ooh, nice.
1909020	1911540	Yeah, that bus was on its way to the mill.
1911540	1912380	So you would have-
1912380	1914060	Oh, you would have been right on it.
1914420	1917820	I don't know what decisions I would make differently
1917820	1919340	with Jon, probably a lot,
1919340	1921460	but Jon does know as a character
1921460	1925020	that he should have shot Keith like a long time ago.
1925020	1927780	Oh my God.
1929020	1932860	Who was your favorite interlude character that you made?
1932860	1936340	So any of the small Mark characters?
1936340	1938140	Yeah, Martin Cupertino.
1938140	1938980	Oh, okay.
1938980	1940980	So we got one from Calm Comfy Campground there.
1940980	1942940	Everett Pace for me, I loved him.
1943140	1944180	He was really fun.
1944180	1945340	All three of those were really good.
1945340	1946780	Justin, what about you?
1946780	1949740	Like all of my beautiful children that I've created.
1949740	1954740	Yeah, you got Don, you got Jack Pearlman.
1954820	1957500	Don and Donovan, the two Donnies.
1957500	1958940	Yeah, the Donnies.
1958940	1960380	I really like Donovan because I love-
1960380	1962220	Shut the fuck up.
1962220	1963420	Who are you telling to shut the fuck up?
1963420	1964420	Shut the fuck up, Donnie.
1964420	1965260	Donnie.
1965260	1966500	Oh, oh yeah.
1966500	1968220	That old chestnut.
1968220	1969780	It's a movie.
1969780	1971780	No, I really enjoyed being Donovan
1971780	1975500	because he felt so opposite of like all the characters.
1975500	1976340	He was good.
1976340	1977180	He was really good.
1977180	1978820	And then his turn at the end, wow,
1978820	1981140	you made some really dark decisions there.
1981140	1983060	Yeah, I definitely wasn't forced upon it
1983060	1986020	by some unknown entity.
1986020	1988180	I messaged you and was like,
1988180	1989740	hey, you want to get fucking wild?
1989740	1993580	And you were like, anything to give Donovan more power
1993580	1995540	is literally what you responded with.
1995540	1997180	I would literally,
1997180	1999900	you want me to kill all those members of contention?
2000900	2002820	They also said for Zach,
2002820	2004700	what do you need from the community
2004700	2007700	to release the campaign notes in some form?
2007700	2008540	Money.
2010860	2015020	Which actions from the players did you most expect
2015020	2018300	and which was the furthest from what you expected?
2018300	2019300	Good question.
2020180	2023340	I expected some things here and there,
2023340	2025660	but most of the time I just,
2025660	2027860	honestly guys, I set up scenarios
2027860	2029820	with the hope that you will surprise me.
2030700	2032300	I don't plan the ending of any of this stuff.
2032300	2036580	And so everything, like fucking everything constantly.
2036580	2038340	Yeah, but like, I mean,
2038340	2040060	we touched on this in another question.
2040060	2041460	I think the most surprising thing
2041460	2043100	has to be the myriad Keith.
2043100	2045540	Yeah, the myriad Keith name.
2045540	2046380	I didn't plan it.
2046380	2048740	No, yeah, that was the great thing.
2048740	2051340	You could see that like by the twinkle in your eye,
2052700	2055180	you had thought of it almost as you said it.
2056700	2059300	That's the way to role play by my book.
2060220	2061940	It just says, do what you want.
2063940	2066540	What's the most squeamest thing
2066540	2069060	you've seen in real life?
2069060	2069900	Snake.
2069900	2070740	A snake probably.
2070740	2071580	A snake, yeah.
2071580	2073940	I saw a really big giant black snake in Arkansas
2073940	2074860	when I was a little kid.
2074860	2076100	It was so cool.
2076100	2076940	Oh, that's rad.
2076940	2079500	It was so big that we heard it dragging itself
2079500	2082060	across the concrete of the carport
2082060	2085260	and we thought it was a plastic bag rustling in the wind.
2085260	2086100	It's just loud.
2086100	2090140	Do you ever feel like a fat snake?
2090140	2091580	Like a fat snake.
2093100	2098100	The snap, like I saw a snap, like a-
2099140	2099980	Kimono dragon.
2099980	2101900	I saw a huge turtle one time.
2101900	2104180	I was like, that's cool.
2104180	2105020	And it was wet.
2105020	2106780	It was a big wet turtle.
2106780	2111740	Edgeworth08 asks, what was the editing process like?
2111740	2116060	How much did you cut and did it become less and easier?
2117020	2117980	As time went on.
2117980	2119300	Editing is-
2119300	2120220	Difficult.
2120220	2124940	I cut out anything that seems repetitive
2124940	2129940	or unnecessary or dead air or me saying um,
2132940	2135820	like with a long space on either side of it.
2135820	2137820	That's mostly what I edit out.
2137820	2139620	I don't edit out a lot of content.
2139620	2141660	There's not like role-playing scenes
2141660	2143780	that I have to cut ever.
2144780	2147180	And as you all know from listening,
2147180	2150220	when someone says like, hey, let's cut that out.
2150220	2155220	That's typically like a cue to leave everything in.
2155900	2160180	So you really hear pretty much everything that we do.
2160180	2162020	Those of you in the Den of Sin just know
2162020	2167020	that I edit out dead air.
2170100	2173100	Not even a lot, just enough to keep it all going.
2173300	2175180	I just want listening to this show
2175180	2178500	to be a nonstop fucking ride.
2178500	2180860	And that's kind of been my goal
2180860	2183900	is that it just pushes, pushes, pushes constantly.
2183900	2184740	For sure.
2184740	2186480	TD underscore Woogie says,
2186480	2189860	is Wolf the dog going to still be around in season two?
2189860	2191360	I hope so.
2191360	2194020	And there's a follow up from Sensory13 that says,
2194020	2196660	and or Justin as a full-time character.
2196660	2199340	Second chance to give us the right answer, Justin.
2199340	2202060	What do you think?
2202060	2204220	Yeah, you still busy?
2204220	2205540	Say it.
2205540	2206380	Fish.
2212100	2212940	I don't know, Zach.
2212940	2215820	Is Wolf the dog going to be in season two?
2215820	2220820	Find out on the first episode of season two, but also.
2221000	2221840	But maybe not.
2221840	2222680	Yes.
2224220	2225500	Oh, Justin said, maybe not.
2227300	2228800	TBD apparently.
2228800	2231180	I hope so too, TD underscore Woogie.
2231180	2234620	I hope that Wolf is still around in season two as well.
2234620	2237240	He might be busy, guys.
2239540	2241860	Like underscore Larry says,
2241860	2243540	this is a question for Zach.
2243540	2246760	Were the story arcs inspired by the intro songs at all?
2246760	2248380	Or were you able to find songs
2248380	2252380	that the lyrics oddly tied up with the story arcs?
2252380	2254940	Either way, it's very impressive.
2256120	2259420	I found songs that matched what I was doing so far
2259420	2261100	is my answer to this question.
2262060	2264860	However, No Backbone was chosen
2264860	2269480	before I decided that the balls would rip out your spine.
2269480	2270320	Yeah.
2270320	2271140	Yeah, right.
2271140	2275180	So the plot of the balls definitely came from No Backbone,
2275180	2277220	but then for the rest of the stuff,
2277220	2278660	anything that was coincidental.
2278660	2279780	Actually, you know what?
2279780	2281180	I definitely listened to the lyrics
2281180	2282980	and just like threw stuff in every once in a while.
2282980	2285220	There's a really fun thing in Pretty Sexual
2285220	2289660	that's like, I swore I knew you before this.
2289660	2290500	Yeah.
2291020	2291860	It was good.
2291860	2294060	When I like heard that lyric,
2294060	2295740	yeah, that probably definitely influenced
2295740	2298240	even though that was gonna be probably part of the plot.
2298240	2299900	Honestly, I don't know.
2299900	2300740	Moving on.
2301900	2304900	It was a lot of back and forth there, I think.
2304900	2309900	Brofos, brofos, brofos, brofos, brofos, brofos, brofos.
2310780	2312220	What about Brofose?
2312220	2313460	Brofose.
2313460	2315220	What was up with all the hand sanitizer
2315220	2317280	in the Cabin in the Woods arc?
2317320	2321240	The hand sanitizer specifically was being used
2321240	2325000	by Mary, M-A-R-Y, Ball,
2325000	2328720	who was Old Madge hanging out in the woods.
2328720	2331660	Old Madge was M-A-R-Y, the ball,
2331660	2336200	and she had concocted this gel
2336200	2340560	that could be put on human skin
2340560	2342380	and then would- And it killed bacteria.
2342380	2343220	Would.
2343220	2344060	Whoa.
2349660	2351060	It was amazing.
2351060	2352620	I hope that answers your question.
2352620	2355560	Denny Cready asks the functions
2355560	2356400	of all the different key devices.
2356400	2357740	Well, you know, I wanna know.
2361120	2365180	Basically, if you used the hand sanitizer,
2365180	2370180	it allowed me as the handler to pull you out of reality
2371020	2374860	and get you, quote, lost.
2374860	2378160	So anytime someone used hand sanitizer,
2378160	2382100	I took the initiative to anytime they were moving
2382100	2383680	from one place to another,
2383680	2387400	they got lost on the way to their destination.
2387400	2390140	So that is what the hand sanitizer did.
2390140	2393920	It allowed me to put the PCs into situations
2393920	2395460	that they were not expecting.
2395460	2397260	Cool. Yeah, that was really fun.
2397260	2399300	Denny Cready says the functions
2399300	2401620	of all the different goo devices is clear
2401620	2403220	apart from the helmet.
2403220	2406400	What exactly does the helmet do?
2406400	2407520	You say that the functions
2407520	2410060	of all the different goo devices is clear.
2410060	2413380	Oh, they also say it seems it's either illusory
2413380	2417220	or allows the user to benefit from other dimensions.
2417220	2420280	The goo devices, let's go over them real quick.
2420280	2421740	First ones, the camera.
2421740	2423180	The camera takes pictures
2423180	2427860	when it has been a certain amount of time in between uses.
2427860	2430820	It was all based on time for these devices,
2430820	2433860	or as we saw Pastor Adam Kane use,
2433860	2437460	you could slam some goo up toward the,
2437460	2439700	the goo was able to travel through glass,
2439700	2443300	and so it could move into any of these devices
2443300	2446460	and then charge them and make that green light lit.
2446460	2450140	The camera was taking pictures of the dark place,
2450140	2452400	the plane that you guys ended up in,
2452400	2454260	and that was all just random
2454260	2457040	and based on plot, how I wanted to do that.
2457080	2458800	It wasn't based on location or time
2458800	2460920	of what you guys were getting in those pictures.
2460920	2463920	The gun, okay, this is the weird one.
2463920	2468280	The gun had a bullet that was in the trunk
2468280	2471480	that John Peters pulled from the green box.
2471480	2476480	The bullet was to take the user to the Old West,
2476920	2481260	specifically made by Keith Beans as Silas Cole
2481260	2483020	to eventually get back there.
2483020	2488020	However, that bullet was used by Tildi B. Mitchell, right?
2488700	2490520	So she slams the bullet in.
2490520	2495220	The person who used the gun previous was Jermaine Glass,
2495220	2497780	who used it before the podcast started.
2497780	2500980	So what happened was John Peters pulls the trunk
2500980	2503220	out of the green box, goes home.
2503220	2506740	He owes the Glass family mob a lot of money.
2506740	2509860	The two brothers show up at John Peters' house
2509860	2510900	to get the money.
2510900	2514780	John Peters grabs the gun to try to defend himself,
2514780	2518920	pulls the trigger, and inside the barrel of this gun,
2518920	2523920	inside the chamber of this gun is, what is it?
2524060	2525940	Not the bullet from the Old West.
2525940	2530220	Therefore, the ooze goes in and fills up the chamber,
2530220	2534740	sending him to the ooze plane of existence.
2534740	2538580	The next time it's used, Tildi B. Mitchell grabs the bullet
2538580	2542000	that was with it, slams it into the cylinder,
2542000	2547000	and then fires, which sends her to the Old West.
2547260	2552260	Then the gun is used once more, finally, by Rose M-A-R-Y
2553940	2557320	after the ball takes over Rosemary's body,
2557320	2561000	but M-A-R-Y knows how to use this gun.
2561000	2566000	So she blew snot into her hand,
2566320	2569640	which would have filled her hand with ooze,
2569640	2571760	and then she loads the gun with ooze
2571760	2576520	so that she can get to that plane, and that is the gun.
2576520	2577360	Straightforward.
2577360	2578660	Very straightforward.
2579800	2582880	The radio is obvious, it switches, you know.
2582880	2586540	It's not obvious, I thought the illusory thing,
2586540	2587920	but he brought up the different dimensions.
2587920	2589560	Oh, the radio, the radio is obvious.
2589560	2590400	Radio is obvious.
2590400	2593840	The radio just switches bodies, but yes, the helmet.
2593840	2595920	You are correct, though, it is illusory.
2596760	2600240	So when the person who is wielding the helmet
2600240	2604120	passes a power contest against someone,
2604120	2608120	then they can change the reality of the person
2608120	2611220	who they are contesting with by using the helmet.
2611220	2613640	But is it an illusion, or is it actual dimensions?
2613640	2614880	It is an illusion.
2614880	2616560	Yeah, it is all illusory.
2616560	2619680	So when you guys were all seeing different stuff
2619680	2623000	at Bean's Pond, you were still interacting
2623000	2624560	with what you thought was real,
2624600	2627160	but as some of you saw,
2627160	2630720	like the repercussions of your decisions
2630720	2632080	came about in a different way.
2632080	2636560	So it wasn't an alternate plane, it was simply illusory.
2636560	2638940	Al-G-Rhythm, oh no.
2640640	2642820	I haven't even seen the new Space Jam,
2642820	2645020	and I know that that's the bad guy's name.
2651520	2654080	It's so cool to know that Don Cheadle listens.
2654880	2658080	He says, hello, I love your show.
2658080	2660400	I have a couple questions.
2660400	2662920	Originally, was the officer whose name changes
2662920	2666440	throughout the show supposed to be the gaslight that it was?
2666440	2667280	No.
2667280	2669780	Or did Zach, oh yes, or did Zach Wright forget
2669780	2671080	to write it down in his notes?
2671080	2672100	No.
2672100	2675160	Was it originally going to be memory manipulation,
2675160	2677040	or was it always time fuckery?
2677040	2679160	It was never either of those things, really,
2679160	2681240	because it was just split dimensions.
2681280	2685120	The whole thing is based off of the Mandela Effect,
2685120	2687840	the Mandela Effect, which I'm a huge fan of.
2687840	2689360	That's a concept that fascinates idiots.
2689360	2690200	Exactly.
2691200	2694020	When I heard about it in college or whatever,
2694020	2697720	I immediately called my mom and was like,
2697720	2700680	who wrote the books with the bears?
2700680	2701680	What were they?
2701680	2702880	The bears.
2702880	2705640	That's the thing that was wrong, is who wrote the books?
2705640	2706480	Who wrote the books?
2706480	2708640	I always thought it was Emily B. Bear.
2708640	2710520	It was Jan.
2712160	2717160	Anyway, so when I was finally able to have Sinbad
2718360	2723360	on the podcast, that's actually one of my crowning
2726600	2729680	and achievements in my mind.
2729680	2733240	Probably against the terms of service for-
2733240	2736680	I looked it up a few times and I didn't find anything
2736680	2738960	that said that it wasn't able to be used.
2739600	2743000	PTBP, I didn't say anything about it.
2743000	2745400	If you want to cut this, it does specifically have,
2745400	2748260	there's categories of people who are doing promotion
2748260	2750640	and not promotion, and you have to make sure that you do.
2750640	2752820	But it's not promotion, it's art, baby.
2756600	2757440	Cool.
2759440	2762180	Luke, that's the name of our Detroiters firm,
2762180	2763480	or that's our logo, at least.
2763480	2764840	It's not promotion, it's art, baby.
2764840	2765680	It's art.
2766580	2768160	Gonna give us $50.
2769000	2774000	All right, yeah, so it was just the time splitting off
2774480	2777040	into different iterations of the same world,
2777040	2779440	but infinite versions of that same world.
2779440	2781340	What a great final question.
2781340	2783240	The final question is-
2783240	2785720	Zach looked up the definition of squamous,
2785720	2788280	the ooze and the worms and all that.
2788280	2790140	Are they goopy or are they squamous?
2790140	2792680	Good question, Zach, what does squamous mean?
2792680	2793520	Scaly, and I-
2793520	2796520	Did you know that when you called the ooze squamous?
2796520	2801520	I've always pictured the ooze as being squamous.
2803400	2804300	I don't believe it.
2804300	2805300	Scaly ooze.
2805300	2807120	Like an old wet turtle.
2807120	2810880	I don't think you've seen the ooze,
2810880	2812580	this word or a turtle.
2815200	2817680	Guys, it's Delta Green.
2817680	2818840	Of course it's squamous.
2818840	2820900	Of course it's squamous.
2820900	2823600	It's a scaly, horrible ooze.
2823640	2827080	It's very goopy and very squamous.
2827080	2829760	See, it's just that those are nearly,
2829760	2830920	it's not that they're quite-
2830920	2832480	No, they're not antithetical,
2832480	2833320	but they're close. They don't quite
2833320	2835280	cancel each other out, but they almost do.
2835280	2836680	Which makes it so creepy.
2836680	2839520	Exactly, it's the conundrum that makes it so scary.
2839520	2841000	The conundrum is that you didn't-
2841000	2842400	Non-Newtonian liquid.
2842400	2845480	Thank you, so a non-Newtonian liquid
2845480	2848940	as both solid and liquid at the same time,
2848940	2853520	and in my mind, that is essentially what this ooze was,
2854320	2856960	that it's this horribly, if you look,
2856960	2858400	if this thing-
2858400	2860040	Yeah, but which part of that is scaly?
2860040	2861920	Dude, if it reached out to you,
2861920	2864080	and you looked at it, and you thought
2864080	2865880	that you would poke your finger up to it,
2865880	2869120	it would be hard, but it's still gooping
2869120	2871320	and oozing toward you at all at the same time.
2871320	2873200	But in a repeated scale pattern?
2873200	2874960	A repeated scale pattern.
2874960	2875800	Scaly?
2875800	2876800	Yeah, squamous.
2877480	2878640	Any questions?
2883640	2886480	No, Zach didn't know what that word meant.
2886480	2888440	Who would you cast as the ooze?
2889520	2890760	Andy Serkis.
2890760	2891800	Nice.
2891800	2892980	It's all that mocap.
2894040	2896520	Maybe the guy who did Jar Jar, since he's the OG.
2896520	2897360	Nice.
2897360	2899320	First one, first one in the biz to do that.
2899320	2900720	Is the ooze a Sith?
2900720	2902480	Is the ooze a Sith?
2902480	2904640	From the ooze's perspective,
2904680	2906880	contention PD is evil, so it's like.
2909200	2911960	Justin, I have a question for you.
2911960	2915000	As you've been making music for the show,
2915000	2919840	have you changed your goal or perspective
2919840	2922000	of each time you sit down to make a track?
2922000	2923300	Oh, absolutely.
2923300	2925040	Yeah, I actually have been thinking about that
2925040	2927120	revving up for season two.
2927120	2929640	I was actually messaging you,
2929640	2930480	because I was like,
2930480	2932660	here's the points I think we should hit,
2932660	2935580	because I can't just make any old random song.
2935580	2937460	I mean, I can, but then it would be like,
2937460	2942460	okay, this is only useful for one really particular moment.
2942660	2944400	So yeah, when I'm thinking about the music,
2944400	2947940	I'm thinking about how it interplays with the,
2947940	2949500	I don't know what the correct term is,
2949500	2953020	the moment to moment of the sound, yes.
2953020	2955780	I'm thinking of how the audio exists.
2955780	2958940	No, I'm thinking of how the music interacts with
2958940	2960780	the different tones.
2960780	2961620	What was that?
2961620	2962460	The feeling, the mood.
2962460	2965140	Oh yeah, the mood, the feel, the vibe, the aura.
2965140	2966580	But yeah, so I...
2966580	2968100	Aria.
2968100	2969020	God damn it.
2969020	2970500	The start of it all.
2970500	2972180	I, what do you get, oh God,
2972180	2974540	you guys keep mumbling, interrupting, I can't.
2974540	2976140	So you try to make it good now, right?
2976140	2978660	So I'm gonna hit you, I'm gonna hit you.
2978660	2979900	Aria.
2979900	2981460	Yeah, I try to make it good.
2986380	2990980	I wanna compliment you on that you do make tracks
2990980	2993540	that fit these moods, but the Western one,
2993540	2997300	the one that has that kind of tinkly guitar or piano riff,
2997300	3002300	maybe it is, that is so perfectly creepy and old timey.
3002420	3004180	It's one of my favorites, it's so good.
3004180	3005020	Thank you.
3005020	3008420	I liked the, it was fun to know ahead of time
3008420	3010100	that there was gonna be the old West arc
3010100	3012580	and be like, all right, let's do some...
3012580	3014660	Basically I took what I would have done,
3014660	3017160	like a weird arpeggiated synth thing or other,
3017160	3020400	or just nasty synth stuff and converted it over
3020840	3024600	to like Western instruments and stylings and stuff.
3024600	3025800	And so that was very fun.
3025800	3028400	The name that Justin gave the track
3028400	3032640	that Joe brought up there, The Urgent Wind.
3032640	3034280	Nice, yeah.
3034280	3036840	The Urgent Wind was the time rewind.
3036840	3039240	That one wasn't in the old Western arc, was it?
3040920	3042280	That one's called A Road,
3042280	3044480	then it just got uploaded to YouTube
3044480	3046760	cause someone on the subreddit.
3046760	3049120	A Road or A Road?
3049120	3051080	A Road.
3051080	3051920	A Rod.
3051920	3052880	A Road.
3052880	3053700	I love it.
3053700	3054540	It's a good one.
3054540	3055920	I thought you were talking about the one that's like...
3055920	3056760	Waaah.
3058240	3059560	No, I also love that one.
3059560	3060800	That's my favorite track.
3060800	3062280	The one that has the big strings.
3062280	3064760	It's just me on a microphone going waaah.
3069360	3070600	Zach never uses it,
3070600	3073740	and it's Zach's, it's Joe's fucking favorite song.
3075160	3077880	Put it in the show, coward.
3077880	3080160	It's all right, I fall asleep to it at night anyway.
3080160	3083040	Yeah, it's four hours long, so I get it.
3083040	3084380	He's like, hey.
3086180	3087720	Hey folks, thanks for listening.
3087720	3088560	You're welcome.
3088560	3091520	Wait, no, you, the listener, not me.
3091520	3095000	No, we really appreciate you listening, Justin.
3095000	3095920	Oh, yeah.
3095920	3096760	Thanks, Justin.
3096760	3097600	Thanks, Justin.
3097600	3098420	You're welcome.
3098420	3099420	Do you have any questions for us?
3099420	3100260	Yeah.
3102600	3104060	As a matter of fact.
3105240	3106480	Unfurls a scroll.
3106480	3107660	What the fuck?
3108880	3109720	Hey, Zach.
3109720	3110560	Good question.
3110560	3111920	What the fuck, bro?
3111920	3114400	Hey, Justin, I've been meaning to tell you,
3114400	3116760	our friendship means a whole bunch to me,
3116760	3119080	and I'm really proud of you,
3119080	3122200	that you're taking the shot at grad school
3122200	3124100	and really focusing on it.
3124100	3126640	And while doing that,
3126640	3130440	we've created the artistic collaboration
3130440	3133320	that I've been most proud of in my entire life.
3133320	3136600	And we've collaborated on a lot of artistic stuff together
3136600	3139640	from music to short films to this.
3139640	3142760	And this is like really fun to make.
3142760	3146120	And I'm really glad that you're on the team.
3146120	3147360	Thank you.
3147360	3148200	Thank you.
3148200	3149020	Me too.
3149020	3149860	I agree.
3149860	3151080	We weren't talking to the rest of you.
3151080	3152360	This is me and Zach's time.
3152360	3153180	Oh, sorry.
3153180	3154020	I'm sorry.
3154020	3154840	I'm sorry.
3154840	3155680	I'm sorry.
3155680	3160680	No, I love creative group collaboration is fucking rips.
3162880	3164960	Everyone should try it sometime.
3164960	3165800	Seriously.
3165840	3166680	When you first started this,
3166680	3168800	did you think our characters were gonna die
3168800	3171180	and we would make new ones or were you?
3171180	3172020	Yeah.
3172020	3172840	Yeah.
3172840	3173680	Yep.
3173680	3176240	And I thought you'd have new ones.
3176240	3178240	We're gonna do that in season two, by the way.
3178240	3181080	I'm gonna pull out the rug from some of those
3181080	3184980	Pulp Cthulhu rules that we're using.
3184980	3188640	And we're gonna go a little bit harder on Delta Green
3188640	3192400	to get some nice, satisfying character death.
3193320	3197240	Is this a regular street like feed episode?
3197240	3198320	This is.
3198320	3200560	If you want to hear me play a minion,
3201520	3203040	subscribe to the Patreon.
3203040	3203880	Nope.
3203880	3206000	That is also gonna be on the main feed.
3206000	3206840	That is?
3206840	3207660	Yeah.
3207660	3208500	Do it anyway.
3209880	3211600	He's talking about his own thing he's gonna put out.
3211600	3212440	Oh, that's right.
3212440	3213600	Yeah.
3213600	3218600	Luke, are you gonna run a RPG where we all play minions
3218620	3220380	and you play guru?
3220380	3221220	Yes.
3222220	3225380	Yes, we will be doing that before season two.
3225380	3227380	Why did you conjure that into existence?
3230500	3231460	I don't even.
3231460	3233260	I quit if you don't edit that out.
3235180	3236660	I'm writing it right now as soon as I.
3236660	3239100	Do minions say anything except banana?
3239100	3241580	Would we all just be yelling banana at Luke?
3241580	3242700	What else do they say?
3242700	3246580	Pudding and other kind of like desserts and fruits.
3246580	3247420	Pudding.
3249300	3250220	Oh my God.
3251580	3252420	Yeah.
3255140	3258100	Yeah, so thanks for listening.
3258100	3261260	We're gonna be back next week, actually.
3261260	3262900	We're gonna be back next week.
3262900	3267180	If you follow along on Instagram or Twitter or Facebook,
3267180	3269940	Reddit or Discord or any of the places
3269940	3272780	where you can find out information from us
3272780	3276160	outside of just listening to our voices speak,
3276160	3279120	then you know that on November 5th,
3279120	3284120	the first episode will be out of a short five episode run
3284520	3288280	that we're doing with a guest handler
3288280	3291200	running us through the Delta Green scenario,
3291200	3294560	Convergence that is being updated by Delta Green
3294560	3296360	and Arc Dream publishing right now
3296360	3299760	and our handler was able to get his hands on
3299760	3303280	straight from the source of Shane Ivy,
3303280	3306740	a copy of the updated version of Convergence
3306740	3308620	for the new Delta Green role playing game
3309120	3310420	to run for us.
3310420	3313140	And then after that, on the main feed,
3313140	3315940	I will be running Control Copy,
3315940	3317760	another Delta Green scenario,
3317760	3320260	this one written by Dennis Detwiller,
3320260	3324260	which the patrons voted on over on patreon.com
3324260	3325820	slash pretending pod.
3325820	3329940	They chose Control Copy for me to run for this crew
3329940	3332780	and that'll be out after Convergence.
3332780	3336260	And so that's what we've got ready now
3336260	3338340	and more on the horizon.
3338920	3342620	And we're all really, really looking forward to it.
3342620	3344920	I can't wait to play.
3344920	3347580	Yeah, we got so much good gaming ahead of us.
3347580	3349140	Oh yeah.
3349140	3352300	There's a lot of gaming left in these old bones, Joe.
3352300	3357300	So let us tickle your ear holes
