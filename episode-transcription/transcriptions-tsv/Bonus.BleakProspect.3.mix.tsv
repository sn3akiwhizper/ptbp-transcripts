0	4640	This is yet another introduction from your big boy Wolfie.
4640	7320	Hello to anyone out there that is listening.
7320	12320	I'm Glistening, live here from 694.2 PTBP.
13200	17160	Recorded live in front of a studio audience.
17160	22160	And live in front of my producer, at least.
22480	26040	Producer don't seem to talk too much these days, though.
26040	29320	Speaking of my possibly deceased producer,
29320	32200	we got a new Howlin' with Wolf this week.
32200	34440	Who's delivering these to me?
34440	38200	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Big Danny Dan Dan,
38200	41800	who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,
41800	45600	which is a top notch internet move in my opinion.
45600	46720	They right.
46720	49760	Hey friends, just wanted to say thank you so much
49760	52380	for the great work you put into this pod.
52380	55440	It has brought me an immense amount of joy and comfort.
55440	59480	Zach, your world building and storytelling is top class.
59480	63320	Justin, your music is absolutely on point.
63320	67920	And to our dear PCs, your characters always managed
67920	72920	to accentuate the absurdity that is human nature just right.
72920	76120	PS, to everyone, winter is coming.
76120	78960	Love each other and remember your vitamin D.
78960	83040	Also to whom it may concern, your tea is getting cold.
83040	86000	Love, Big Danny Dan Dan.
86000	89320	Well hello, Big Danny Dan Dan.
89320	92080	The only pod I know about is the ones
92080	94720	from which my spawn will hatch out of.
94720	98180	Millions of tiny baby wolves, many limbed
98180	102960	and frothing at the mouth, hungry for father's special maulk.
102960	106000	They will probably devour us all rather quickly
106000	108120	when the birthing concludes.
108120	111160	But as I posted on my dating app profile,
111160	115040	I'm here for a good time, not a long time.
115040	118940	But also, what the fuck is time anyway?
118940	123200	If you want to howl at your wolf, tag us on the internet
123200	126440	or write a five star review and shoot us an email.
126440	128840	All the links are in the show notes.
128840	132040	It takes like two minutes tops, fuck.
132040	133640	And if you're sitting on the toilet
133640	135880	or trapped by a sleeping pet right now,
135880	138560	you have absolutely no excuses.
138560	139480	Get on it.
139480	143640	Wolf can and will wait, but only like barely
143640	145760	because it's time to get scary.
145760	148200	I don't want to be gruff or forward,
148200	151320	but I would do weird stuff to scot doorward.
151320	154040	Those who would love to are not alone.
154040	157400	It's time for kudzu with no backbone.
157960	159440	THEME SONG
159440	189280	So, you're there at the doorway of what you
189280	192520	presume is Astin Hawkes' laboratory.
192920	197240	It is dark inside, there is that sound of
197240	201120	something perhaps moving in liquid towards the
201120	204960	back. There are indistinct shapes in the gloom,
204960	207600	but there really isn't enough light to work out
207600	208800	what anything is.
209840	212080	Do you guys want me to run away and tear again,
212440	214320	just in case you want to recheck your pockets
214320	216160	with another luck roll for those flashlights?
219280	225960	No, but Frederick Mellon is a seasoned burglar
226360	230160	and has worked in the dark many, many times and
230160	236720	has learned to rely on his keen sense of ears as
236720	238160	well as smell.
239040	244680	And so he is going to try to really dig past his
244680	249440	inability to see, to make out anything else
249440	250600	that's going on in this room.
250880	252400	Yeah, give us a daredevil roll.
252400	254520	Carl's going to check his pockets to see if he
254520	255560	has a lighter in there.
255640	257160	OK, well, give me a luck roll.
258680	260840	Seven on a 20.
261280	264600	You do have your trusty old Zippo in there.
264600	267520	I see Frederick making some weird faces, like
267960	271360	sniffing around and trying to hear, and I flip
271360	273600	that on like this, this might help.
273600	276600	I passed my listen roll, so I hear the lighter.
281160	283560	But also, yeah, that listen roll does help you
283560	285880	identify where that sound is coming from.
286240	288840	And sure enough, as you've got a bit of light in
288840	291320	there and it's a lighter, so it's not lighting up
291320	294520	the whole room, but as Dr.
294520	297320	Rothstein mixes way in a bit, you can make out
297320	299920	details and you can see a glint at the back of
299920	304880	glass and metal, and you reckon the sound you
304880	307160	heard of something moving in liquid came from
307160	310320	back there. And in the little bit of light you
310320	314040	have, it looks, well, maybe not quite like a fish
314040	317360	tank, but certainly, you know, there's more metal
317360	318800	on it than a fish tank.
319560	321920	But there's glass windows and it definitely looks
321920	323920	like some kind of large tank that's holding
323920	326280	liquid. But you can also make out that there are
326280	329480	a number of workbenches that have got all sorts
329480	331200	of equipment on them, including more of these
331200	336760	cylinders and forceps and gloves and aprons and
336760	337640	stuff like that.
337680	339960	Frederick Mellon will grab a pair of forceps.
340280	340600	Good.
340600	343680	Yeah, we should stock up on all of those, all
343680	347760	those things. A forcep and a canister for every
347760	352800	man. Do we see any light fixtures?
353360	355760	Yeah, there are a number of light fixtures.
356160	359960	There is also something that looks like an
359960	362160	electrical wiring loom with all sorts of
362160	365680	equipment. And yeah, you're not quite sure
365680	367720	initially what it is, or maybe with a bit of
367720	368320	time, Dr.
368320	369800	Rothstein could work it out.
370440	372960	But what looks like some fairly complicated
372960	376040	electronics just covering an entire part of the
376040	377480	wall on this loom.
378280	381480	And there is a bigger knife switch that's there
381480	382840	and a few controls.
383400	386480	The other thing that attracts your attention is
386480	391000	the floor. The floor is flag stoned, but there is
391520	395840	this big ring of metal of some kind, maybe
395840	398200	copper, that seems to have all these strange
398200	402960	carvings and designs in it that is connected up
402960	406440	somehow to this electrical loom.
406960	409280	Are the workbenches all outside of that?
409480	409880	Yes.
410000	411480	Or does it kind of run around the room
411480	412080	indiscriminately?
412400	415600	No, it's a circle that's within the center of
415600	417760	the room. All the other equipment, everything
417760	420240	else is outside that circle.
420320	420840	Cool, yeah.
420920	423360	Hey, Luke, what's Karl Rothstein's electrical
423520	423960	repair?
424000	425000	60%.
425080	427240	Dope. I was hoping it was higher than mine
427240	429200	because I actually pulled 50 in it because I
429200	432360	thought Frederick Mellon might have cut
432360	435920	people's power when he went to rob them, you
435920	438800	know, gotten adept at handling that kind of
438800	440720	stuff. But then I was like, Oh, no, what if I
440720	443040	put my electrical repair higher than the
443160	443680	physicist?
445600	446080	Did you?
447360	447680	No.
447720	449760	This copper circle, is there anything on the
449760	450840	ceiling directly above it?
450960	452200	No, it's just on the floor.
452440	453040	Good question.
453520	455000	But Dr.
455000	457560	Rothstein in particular can work out fairly
457560	462600	quickly, I guess, that there is no power source
462600	465960	in this room. But obviously, you saw those
465960	468600	cables going off to the other outbuildings.
469080	472800	And, you know, it probably makes sense to you
472800	475200	that those must be external generators.
476040	479360	Rothstein, we heard about some kind of portal.
479760	481000	Do you think this here is that?
481200	484200	I mean, if anything was a portal, that would be
484200	486800	it. Don't you believe?
488120	489280	It is very portally.
489440	492160	I mean, when you think of portal, you think of
492160	492920	that, don't you?
493160	497200	I don't have a great sci-fi horror frame of
497200	499560	reference at this point in history.
501880	505400	You know, this might not be science fiction.
505480	506760	This is real life.
506800	508480	So I didn't know.
509040	512200	I just the answer to my question is, yes, it
512200	513160	looks like a portal.
513520	514240	I think it is.
514480	516320	Frederick Mellon is like standing in the middle
516320	519960	of it and he's like, oh, this jumps out of the
519960	521880	middle of the circle back on the other side.
522200	524600	I believe those there might be generators on
524600	528360	the outside. Should we try to turn the power on?
529120	530800	No, absolutely not.
530800	533160	We should try to destroy the generators.
533160	536480	That way the power can't ever be turned on unless
536480	538160	we're trying to send these things back.
538160	540160	I thought we were going to send them back.
540480	542280	No, I think we just light them on fire.
542680	545000	Oh, sending them back would be much more fun.
545480	547840	While this conversation is going on, Nathaniel
547840	551000	wants to walk back further toward the tank and
551000	552400	inspect it a little closer.
552440	555880	OK, well, you're obviously now moving outside
555880	558400	the penumbra of Rothstein's Lighters, so it's
558400	563200	fairly dark. But yeah, you get back there and
563840	567480	yeah, there is some kind of dark liquid, probably
567480	570680	water, maybe not, inside this tank.
571080	574320	And in the little bit of light you have, you can
574320	578440	just make out shapes moving within it, including
578440	579960	one fairly large one.
580440	583160	Are the shapes roughly like the bugs I've seen
583160	586440	before, or is it a wholly new thing to me?
586560	588280	There's...
588600	592040	Well, give me a spot hidden as you're doing this
592040	594360	in the gloom.
597040	600680	I pass a 7 on a 25.
600680	601160	25.
601400	604520	So, yeah, you can see that a few of the things
604520	608160	that wriggle past do look like the specimens
608200	612560	that you saw earlier, albeit larger versions.
613120	615560	But there is something in that tank as well.
615560	618000	You can't really make out the details a bit, but
618000	621400	from the size and shape of it, it looks...
622240	626080	No, it looks very, very different, paler and
626080	630040	larger. And there are tendrils coming off it.
633320	637160	I turn around and announce to the guys, it looks
637200	640400	like maybe they keep them here swimming around
640400	642880	or something. There's another one.
642880	645000	There's another thing in there.
645200	649400	I don't know if it's like insects in our world.
649480	652080	It's maybe it's queen or something.
652080	655160	As he's pointing behind him, Thomas Dolan
655160	658160	dramatically flips on the lights and nothing
658160	658640	happens.
660800	661480	Fuck.
664800	667080	All right, well, I lost rock, paper, scissors, so
667080	668840	we're going to try to turn this thing on and
668840	670840	send these things back to where they came from.
670840	674280	So I guess we get ready to push over the tank
674280	677800	into the big old copper circle and then two of
677800	680040	us go to the generator rooms, flip on the
680040	684720	switches on the count of 50 and then, you know,
684720	687680	the two left inside here push over the fish tank
687680	690520	into the into the circle and then we'll turn it
690520	691120	back off.
691400	691880	Sure.
692000	693600	I have no objections to this plan.
693600	695920	I think it's an OK plan.
696320	697760	We don't know a lot about this portal.
697760	699520	We could turn it on and they come flooding out
699520	700160	at us.
700160	701920	I don't know if it's how it works.
701920	703080	I think it's worth a shot.
703080	704960	That's let's push that tank over.
704960	706280	I'm too weak to do it.
706280	708800	So I have to be one of the ones working in the
708800	711640	electric city, which I have some experience with.
712560	714400	So if they do come flooding out, that's a risk
714400	715200	I'm willing to take.
715200	716320	Rothstein, let's go.
716880	717360	Sweet.
717360	717880	Perfect.
718160	720640	Coombs, do you think you can push this tank over
720640	721200	on your own?
723920	724600	I don't know.
725040	726240	I'm not there.
728080	730160	I just figured instead of counting to 50, I could
730160	731920	I could be somewhere in the middle and I could let
731920	734600	out a note on my fiddle and everybody works
734600	735720	together at the same time.
739160	741120	Five, six, seven, eight.
742080	744120	But I could also be there standing by the tank
744120	744600	with you.
744840	746440	Well, we'll know when the lights come on.
746440	748200	I guess that they did their part and then we tip
748200	748880	the tank over.
748880	750800	We could even have once they get the generators
750800	753160	going, they could just join us back in here.
753720	755600	We still got to flip a switch on the machine, right?
755920	758480	Oh, we want to be ready to turn off the generators,
758480	758840	right?
759000	761160	We just turn the flip the switch back off.
761280	761720	Right.
762040	763800	The portal switch seems to be in here.
764160	764680	Okay.
765040	768000	I'm going to stick with this confidence that we
768000	771720	have, that we know what's going on with this and
771720	773640	be like, oh yeah, fuck yeah, dude.
773760	774880	All right, let's go.
774920	775240	What?
775240	776800	Are you think we're going to fuck up and do them
776800	777640	all humanity?
777640	778680	Like, come on.
780120	780760	I doubt it.
780760	781840	Nothing mentioned, nothing gained.
781840	784520	People like us don't have the power to change
784520	785400	human history.
785760	788360	They've told us that over and over our entire
788360	789880	lives, they've let us know.
790240	792880	I mean, my entire life for you guys just recently.
792880	797240	But we're not the ones who are here to, like,
797680	798520	shake up this.
798520	799200	How old are you?
799200	800520	I'm like 27.
801400	802440	I'm 44.
804800	806600	No, my character sheet says old.
807520	810760	So Frederick Mellon I is firing up the generators,
810760	811480	is that right?
811560	812560	At least one of them.
812760	813280	Okay.
813280	816000	And I could do both now that we're not doing it
816000	817000	at the same time.
817040	817480	Sure.
817520	817720	Yeah.
817720	819680	It's not like a pressure plate puzzle or anything,
819680	820240	I don't think.
822080	822360	Yeah.
822360	824920	I mean, it doesn't take much to fire up the generators.
824920	826720	You can see that there are a few drums of diesel
826720	827600	there as well.
827640	831440	So, but there seems to be enough fuel in there that
831440	835880	you fire up the generators and then, yeah, the lights
835920	839080	inside the laboratory start flickering on.
839160	841760	It takes a minute for Mellon to come back because
841760	845360	he's going to roll one of those tanks of diesel
846280	847560	back to the lab.
847720	848240	Sure.
848600	850840	Just in case we all need to die in a horrible
850840	852440	conflagration, I get you.
852480	853560	That's exactly right.
854400	855000	Okay.
855040	857520	But for the rest of you, once the lights are on,
857520	861080	you can see much better what's inside here.
861440	864240	As I said, there's fairly complex a wiring loom
864240	867120	with all sorts of weird stuff going on in there.
867880	870880	There are the workbenches with odd bits of equipment.
871280	876480	You also see that there is a journal or at least
876480	879480	a notebook of some kind on the bench as well.
880080	882760	The tank, you get a better idea now.
883240	885040	Pulling it over is going to be difficult because
885040	886880	it is bolted to the stone wall.
890240	894120	The things moving around inside, yeah, most of them
894120	899680	do look like this thing that Caspar Brink had
899680	901680	referred to as species 17.
903000	906360	There's something else, though, this larger thing.
907120	909440	There's something about it that reminds you of a
909440	912840	monkey in the shape of it, but maybe a monkey
912840	914720	that's been turned inside out.
915000	917800	And it's floating there in the water.
918160	921640	Its limbs do look more like tentacles than arms.
922560	925920	It's just floating placidly in the middle of all this.
926880	928360	Let's have a sanity roll off Dr.
928360	932400	Coombs as he was the one taking an interest in the contents of the tank.
935000	937400	Taking an interest in the inside out monkey?
939880	943080	I fail, a 93 on a 32.
943120	945280	OK, so you lose a D4.
946240	946680	One.
946920	951600	OK, but yeah, I think the rest of you here, Dr.
951600	956480	Coombs, just cry out an alarm as the lights come on.
956640	958840	And basically, he's been standing there trying to
958840	960560	stare into this tank and all of a sudden he gets a
960560	962320	really good look at what's on the other side of the
962320	965080	glass and just staggers back and lands heavily on
965080	965720	the ground.
968720	969880	That's such a good shot.
970760	971120	Dr.
971120	974280	Osteen is now in a position to actually get a better
974280	975960	look at some of this equipment.
977360	980960	There's also, like I say, this journal, this
980960	985800	leather-bound volume, at least, that's sitting on the workbench.
985920	987960	What, are we going to read the journal like a bunch of nerds?
988440	989480	Let's just flip the switch.
991840	993240	Luke, I think your mic is off.
993560	994000	OK.
994320	995640	Ah, I thought you were quiet.
996800	997680	That makes more sense.
997680	998880	That's much better.
999600	1005160	Rothstein is going to go inspect the switch for what he thinks is the portal.
1005480	1008200	And then is that book near here, that journal?
1008560	1011520	Yeah, yeah, it's just by all this wiring loom.
1011640	1014120	Yeah, I'm going to look around and I see that and I'm
1014120	1018200	going to open it up and read from the start, see what's in it.
1018240	1022440	Yeah, I mean, there's too much here for you to read through quickly.
1022440	1026720	I mean, you can skim it just to try to pick out the pertinent points.
1027080	1030200	It's written in English, which isn't your first language.
1030520	1033480	So if you're skimming it and trying to dig out the meaning,
1033480	1035000	let's have a read English roll.
1035200	1035760	Off you.
1037600	1040440	I do not pass a 95 on a 50.
1040680	1041880	Oh, Luke, your mic's off.
1041880	1044480	Maybe roll again and tell us where you're at.
1045680	1046120	Right.
1047880	1051840	You're skimming through, but it's going to take you a
1051840	1053960	bit more time to make sense of this.
1054800	1059840	You could just sort of try to ignore the others around you and just really
1059840	1062320	focus on digging this and push the roll.
1062800	1065600	But I mean, you know, there's always the chance that you'll just
1065600	1068120	catastrophically misunderstand what it's saying.
1068720	1070200	I'm going to, I'm going to push the roll.
1071600	1075080	I look over at them and, uh, I'm going to read this.
1075080	1080520	You got, while you guys work on the fish tank and then I rolled a four.
1085080	1088440	I mean, I wish you would have failed it, but so do I.
1088440	1092840	Yeah, the DMs would.
1092840	1094840	Can we spend luck to fail the roll?
1096760	1098160	Yeah, I'm going to spend 16 luck.
1099040	1103040	Zach's like, can I spend my luck to nerf his numbers?
1106200	1109240	I've got 70, so I can make it a pretty bad fail.
1110920	1115040	When Frederick Mellon I comes back to the laboratory, obviously Dr.
1115040	1117240	Rothstein has got his nose in the book.
1118000	1121760	Dr. Coombes is still sitting there on the ground, looking at the fish tank in terror.
1121760	1123400	What's Dolan doing?
1123480	1128080	Dolan is probably pacing around kind of nervously and just trying to pitch in wherever
1128080	1134960	you can. But I bet his anxiety is like, doc, other doc, are you ready over there?
1135640	1137320	Are we going to do this? So we're going to, what's going on?
1138040	1138600	I'm reading.
1138600	1144200	By the way, the other thing that you've noticed, that Frederick Mellon I has noticed
1144200	1150120	as he comes back towards the laboratory, is as you've turned the generator on, a few of
1150120	1153440	the lights, not all of them, but a few of the lights in the main building have come on as
1153440	1153760	well.
1154040	1155480	I was wondering about that.
1155960	1160760	I'm going to do a little roll for him real quick, just to see.
1161480	1164520	He looks up at the lights and he's really drawn.
1165000	1169000	He loves stealing, like from rich people specifically.
1169000	1176200	And so he really wants to go up there, but better judgment says, ah, okay, let me at least
1176200	1177400	check in with the boys.
1178440	1180200	I'm so disappointed in you.
1183680	1185720	I rolled intelligence and I passed.
1187960	1191920	But yeah, as I said, then you make your way back to the laboratory and you see all that
1191920	1193160	other stuff going on.
1193240	1201000	Can I from the ground now shocked by the creature, but I also, can I notice the bolts and
1201000	1205480	then we, uh, we gotta, we gotta find a wrench guys that this thing's bolted to the wall.
1205520	1205840	Okay.
1205840	1206680	I'll go find one.
1206680	1207400	I'll be right back.
1207520	1209120	Well, Freddie, Freddie, hold on.
1209160	1212440	We, maybe we should pursue other options.
1213320	1214560	Can't you just break it?
1214640	1214840	Yeah.
1214840	1216320	That's, that's what I was going to suggest.
1216320	1221800	What if we, what if we break it and we create some kind of channel or funnel, uh, directly
1221800	1222920	into the center of the portal?
1223160	1225640	You know, just some planks or whatever that run to it.
1226040	1226920	How big is this room?
1227480	1235320	Uh, the room is about, yeah, about 10 meters in diameter and it's up against the wall.
1235360	1238560	The, the ring in the floor is fairly large.
1238560	1242600	It doesn't take up the whole room by any means, but yeah, I mean, there's still a few
1242600	1245880	meters between the tank and the, the ring in the ground.
1246000	1248920	So if it were to tip over, it would tip over into the ring.
1249600	1251600	Um, or at least just up to the edge of it.
1251600	1252640	Yeah, perfect.
1252680	1256120	I'm a little worried about our plan now that we've seen that thing.
1256120	1261200	And I point to the creature in the glass that that's, that looks, that looks a little, a
1261200	1264000	little more mobile and dangerous.
1264480	1267120	It's got, it's got, it's just floating there.
1268440	1269240	He's having a good time.
1269240	1270160	It's a happy monkey.
1270200	1274280	That's what makes me not want to just break the glass picture, breaking the glass and
1274280	1276400	then letting a monkey out into this room.
1276560	1277480	That would not be good.
1277560	1278880	I'd like to have a monkey friend.
1278880	1279200	I don't
1280640	1281960	monkeys are horrifying.
1282440	1284080	Haven't you seen the move in pictures?
1284120	1289520	I think you could probably make a lot of money with a monkey act to around train your
1289520	1289960	monkey.
1290520	1291880	That's opportunity right there.
1293040	1295720	Maybe that's how those, all those men became faceless.
1296280	1299720	We should probably let the doc read his book and see what he finds out before we make
1299720	1300360	any moves.
1301160	1303840	Well, while he's reading, we can at least unscrew it.
1304080	1306600	What if it desperately needs to stay where it is?
1306600	1314160	Is the floating monkey creature, is it, are its eyes open?
1314520	1315040	Eyes?
1315200	1315840	What eyes?
1318800	1321040	Are you reading anything good and the fun is there doc?
1321280	1321880	Yeah.
1322080	1324200	So what Dr.
1324200	1330040	Osteen is picking up from the book is you to remember Dr.
1330040	1339200	Hawks was obsessed with the work of another physicist or an inventor who had also, well
1339200	1345320	not vanished, but died under mysterious circumstances a little over 10 years ago, a
1345320	1347080	man called Crawford Tillinghast.
1347800	1355320	And he'd created some kind of device that would shape human perceptions and allow
1355320	1360200	people to see through to other dimensions of reality.
1360960	1369040	But what Hawks seems to have done is taken the subjectivity out of the Tillinghast
1369040	1376160	resonator and created what he refers to as the Hawks device, which creates much the
1376160	1382520	same effect, but in objective reality, rather than it just being an individual who
1382560	1389680	perceives it because of the changes to their pineal gland, that it does actually reshape
1389680	1393320	an area of reality so that it shifts through the dimensions.
1396160	1396800	Hey, Scott.
1397840	1398560	Fuck yeah, dude.
1398560	1399640	That's awesome.
1403640	1409440	But you think from having flipped through this journal that you do have a better idea
1409480	1417240	now of how to operate the Hawks device, that, yeah, your initial surmise was correct, that
1417240	1424920	the ring in the floor does seem to be containment of this hole or whatever it is that's
1424920	1426200	being ripped through reality.
1426400	1432360	From some of the later entries, though, as you flick through the whole thing, there are
1432360	1434120	some worrying indications.
1434760	1438840	Now, that's another thing. Up to about eight years ago, the entries in this were being
1438840	1441760	written by Aston Hawks.
1442200	1447760	They changed hands, though, and the later entries are all written by someone else.
1447920	1449320	You're not quite sure who.
1450360	1458360	And the indication is that in recent weeks, as they've been going on their fishing
1458360	1464960	expeditions, pulling things through from these higher dimensions, the containment from
1464960	1467240	that ring on the floor is failing.
1469840	1476560	We were right, but it may not be working as intended.
1476800	1481360	So maybe like the best idea is kind of what Dr.
1481360	1483040	Nate was saying earlier.
1483400	1487200	And what if we just shove it in real quick and then shut it off?
1487200	1491280	And hopefully nothing breaks containment in that short amount of time.
1491600	1492280	I like it.
1492920	1495000	It seems like a good experiment.
1495440	1499760	Do we get the sense that if we did get it unbolted from the wall, would we be able to do
1499760	1500720	what we're thinking of?
1501240	1503040	Do we feel like we could push this tank?
1503360	1508800	In fact, yeah, the whole thing looks unwieldy enough that, you know, if you unscrewed it
1508800	1512320	from the wall, it would probably do most of the falling over work itself.
1513000	1515960	OK. Perf, consider it unscrewed.
1516720	1523880	Well, with the tools you've got there, let's have a mechanical repair roll off one of you
1523920	1527840	just to see whether you can do this in an orderly manner.
1528000	1529600	I'll do it. What do you have?
1531360	1536880	70 luck. I have a 50 mechanical repair.
1537320	1540160	Yeah, I've got a 40. I have a 20, but I feel good.
1540360	1541680	You feel good? Yeah.
1541680	1542760	And I mean, Dr.
1542760	1544760	Rustine is still busy reading the journal.
1544760	1547880	Right. This is what the others are doing while you're doing that.
1548080	1553040	All right. 54, so I'll spend 34.
1553920	1559160	OK. At first, obviously, this has been bolted into the wall for some time.
1559160	1560600	And at first it's fairly rusty.
1560960	1563080	So you're having to put a bit brute force in there.
1563520	1571120	And a few times the spanner slips and things judder in an alarming manner.
1571120	1574360	But you do manage to just keep it under control.
1575040	1577120	And you're getting down to the last few bolts.
1577120	1582120	The thing is, like I say, it's not very well balanced and it seems to be pulling itself
1582120	1584160	away from the wall at this stage.
1585160	1589440	And if you remove the last few bolts at this stage, it is going to come crashing down.
1589560	1591720	Wait for it. All right.
1592520	1593560	Holding on dearly.
1593640	1596080	Docs, respectively. Freddy's ready over here.
1596280	1598640	We're ready to flip the switch.
1598640	1599720	Should I turn it on?
1599840	1603680	I'm going to go to a workbench and make sure that I have a pair of forceps and a metal
1603680	1606480	canister handy, ready, just in case.
1606520	1607760	Grab the big one first.
1607880	1610440	I think I'm ready.
1610440	1611400	I think I'm ready.
1611640	1619680	Then let's have a physics roll, first of all, or electrical repair, whichever is higher,
1620480	1625280	from Dr. Rothstein, just to operate the machinery based on what you've read.
1626480	1628600	OK, my physics is 70.
1629200	1631680	OK. And I got a 22.
1632280	1634120	Nice. It's a hard success.
1634400	1638880	So, yeah, you've picked up enough from this book that this is all fairly simple.
1639200	1644160	And you can see that, yeah, perhaps, you know, whoever has been working on the journal
1644160	1649560	since then has perhaps got some of the settings slightly wrong, or at least you hope
1649560	1652840	that you're not compounding the problem as you make a few changes.
1653800	1659480	But then if you're ready to do the deed, are you just pulling down the live switch to
1659480	1661360	activate it once you've got everything set up?
1662000	1663800	That's what I was going to do.
1664040	1666960	So if that's what I've gotten from the book, then.
1667320	1675200	Then you do that and, yeah, there is this sparking and the metal ring of the ground
1675200	1681120	starts glowing and almost immediately it's like a heat haze, something rising from the
1681120	1687920	ground. Where you were looking across the room before, now in the center of the room,
1687920	1692280	in that ring, there is something else.
1693040	1696960	There is a shifting landscape, maybe.
1696960	1703120	I mean, your eyes and brain are trying to make sense of it and, you know, it sort of
1703120	1708120	makes sense to try to imagine this as a landscape, but that doesn't really work.
1709240	1715800	There are certainly shapes there and things that are moving, all sorts of strange
1715800	1718640	things, some of them small, some of them large.
1718640	1724440	It is perhaps like looking into a fish tank or some kind of display of deep sea
1724440	1729960	creatures. And there are perhaps, you know, some like the creature you've seen before.
1730440	1734800	There are other things that are larger, that look more predatory, that are shifting
1734800	1738640	around. Some of them have eyes, some of them have other sensory organs.
1738800	1744520	And there is the uncomfortable feeling that as you're looking at them, they're starting
1744520	1746080	to look at you as well.
1746720	1747920	Let's have sanity rolls up.
1747920	1751440	It's working. It's working.
1756600	1761720	Hell, yeah, I fail with a 90 again, I think I've rolled 90s on all of my sanity rolls.
1763160	1764800	31, I fail, 34.
1765160	1767400	Pass. I pass with a 13.
1767680	1768920	So it was melon coons.
1769040	1771960	OK, so can each of you lose a D6, please?
1774400	1776280	Come on, baby. I lost three.
1776280	1776680	Five.
1778920	1787000	So, Dr. Coons, he's shaken, but at least he's not out of his right mind at the moment.
1787480	1792600	Sort of jumps back from the circle and bumps up against one of the workbenchers, knocking
1792600	1797440	tools off. But he is composing himself.
1797720	1800360	Melon, on the other hand, needs to make an intelligence roll.
1803000	1805800	Fredrick Melon, so smart, 24 under 60.
1806560	1811200	Yeah, at this stage, all good sense has left your mind.
1811240	1813640	You are panicking.
1813640	1817360	You've misjudged this whole situation.
1817680	1820360	You need to get out of here as quickly as possible.
1820640	1825400	The problem is that, you know, in your panic, you can't see a way out of here.
1826000	1830280	There was that thing that Rothstein mentioned before about containment failing.
1830440	1837720	And as you're looking around here, you can see that this isn't just contained within this
1837720	1844080	circle. You can see that there's ripples in the air all around, that you're there trapped
1844080	1845200	at the back of the room.
1845680	1848920	How the hell are you going to get out of here without falling into this and getting lost
1848920	1851640	forever? How are you going to get out of this alive?
1852520	1859360	Fredrick Melon, the foist, as he's doing what he was meant to do, which was to, like, push
1859360	1868000	this this big aquarium over, instead turns and is trying to claw through the stone behind
1868000	1874200	him and falling to the ground, kind of like claws down into the floor, trying to escape
1874200	1879760	like a like a rat trapped in a heated up metal bucket stuck on a snitch's belly.
1880040	1881320	Nice.
1881600	1884680	Can you give me a luck roll, please?
1885280	1886000	I can.
1888320	1890000	32 on a 36.
1892840	1894000	Oh, dear. Oh, well.
1895360	1898480	So, yeah, no, you are just clawing.
1898480	1899560	Oh, no, I misread that.
1899560	1900920	It's actually a 100.
1904040	1904400	Whoops.
1905920	1906880	Classic mistake.
1907760	1909440	So it's a 100, is it?
1910760	1913040	No, I passed.
1914720	1919920	OK, so no, you're there on the floor, you're clawing away and you jog the tank for a
1919920	1924320	moment and it creaks and almost comes away from the wall, but doesn't quite.
1924640	1929480	And there's bits of the liquid sloshing down the side, dripping on the ground.
1930040	1934000	And you can hear something above as you jostle the tank.
1934360	1938800	There's you saw that there's some kind of metal hatch on the top and there's something
1939000	1943600	you're convinced now that's just slamming against the tank, just slamming against the
1943600	1946400	hatch, trying to force it open from the inside.
1946640	1948160	You know, it knows you're out there.
1948160	1950760	It's it's clearly coming for you.
1955360	1956640	Oh, my God.
1959160	1966440	Scott, we'll we'll send you a clip of that because the video slowed you down so
1966440	1968520	intensely. Did you guys see what I saw?
1968960	1971920	Slowed you down so intensely as you're describing.
1972160	1975320	And then there at the end, it sped you up.
1975320	1977800	So it's coming for you.
1978520	1981160	Nice. It was really great.
1985160	1990880	Oh, anyway, so what's everyone else doing while Frederick is losing his shit?
1990920	1992120	Do we notice that? Right.
1992120	1994400	Do we see something happening to him?
1994400	1997040	I mean, he is clearly just panicking.
1997040	1998000	I mean, you can see him.
1998200	1999600	He's down on his hands and knees.
1999600	2003320	He's actually beneath the tank now, just clawing away at the ground.
2004200	2008840	From my point in the room, can I would I be able to get to one of those bolts, one of
2008840	2010040	the less bolts?
2010480	2013120	I would like to try and do that while I'm yelling out to Frederick.
2013120	2014440	Frederick, get it together.
2014440	2015640	We got to we got to finish this.
2015640	2016920	Now is not the time for this.
2017440	2019600	Frederick is now under the tank.
2020280	2023920	So, oh, as in if it comes off the wall, it'll crush him.
2025520	2027960	There's a chance. Glass isn't that dangerous.
2028840	2030800	He's under it. He might be in the safest place.
2030800	2033400	You know, a lot of this seems to be made of metal.
2033560	2036800	Actually, I mean, it probably has occurred to Dr.
2036800	2042840	Rothstein that the metals in this room, none of them seem to be ferrous metals.
2042840	2047040	They they mostly seem to be aluminium, which makes sense because science.
2047280	2048720	Well, that means they're non-conductive, right?
2048760	2050040	Or magnetic. Yeah.
2050080	2054240	Yeah. Rothstein doesn't even think to mention it because he's like so obvious.
2054240	2060280	Yeah. If let's say that there were like two bolts left.
2060280	2063760	He's loosening. I'm trying to get one of them loosened also.
2063920	2066320	Dolan is running over to help Coombs.
2066640	2069880	So, yeah, I mean, between the two of you can get the last two bolts off.
2070200	2076240	Are you getting Freddy to safety before you do this or are you just taking your chances
2076480	2078320	and hoping that the tank doesn't crush him?
2085000	2088360	You know, ideally, we get Freddy out of there, but...
2089320	2090720	Yeah, I'll try and get him out.
2090720	2093920	I'll try to get him out. That's for sure what Nathaniel Coombs would do.
2095440	2096880	Yeah, it's part of his bio.
2096920	2099120	He would try to help.
2099920	2102680	Which frees Dolan to focus on the tank.
2103440	2107760	Well, then for Dr. Coombs, give me a STRENGTH roll just to see whether you can drag him
2107760	2110280	to safety before this thing comes crashing down.
2111960	2112240	OK.
2115080	2119080	I FAIL a 95.
2119280	2122840	You've got hold of him, but he's just pulling away too hard.
2123200	2128160	And you can see that Dolan's got just about the last bolt out.
2128440	2134680	You can try pushing the roll, but that means that you're not going to get free either
2135120	2137480	if this comes crashing down before you do so.
2139560	2140400	Oh, shit.
2141880	2143320	Sedgwick, they said it was Sedgwick.
2143400	2147400	Sedgwick was the one who was taking over, but he was he was he's not the closer.
2147520	2149080	He's not the closer. He can't close it.
2149080	2150000	He can't contain it.
2150840	2152640	It's not Kira. It's just not Kira.
2152760	2154240	I'm going to I'm going to push the roll.
2154400	2155160	I'm going to try it.
2155240	2156040	Nice.
2162800	2163600	I FAIL.
2165600	2173040	OK, so, yeah, Dolan can see that Coombs is just pulling Mel into safety, just
2173040	2175840	getting him out of the way as you're taking this last bolt out.
2175840	2178520	And you think you're free and clear just to get the last bolt.
2178800	2184160	And then just as you get it clear, Melon pulls Coombs back in the path of all this,
2184160	2186360	just as it comes topping down.
2187240	2192920	So what I will do is I'll give both Coombs and Melon the chance to do a DODGE roll just
2192920	2196440	to roll clear as this tank comes crashing down.
2199360	2200360	Thank you.
2203040	2207760	I pass. I got a fourteen on a thirty five.
2208080	2208760	Nice.
2208880	2211120	I got a fifty five on a fifty.
2212040	2213320	So I'm going to spin five luck.
2213640	2214920	Nice. Fuck yeah.
2215440	2215920	OK.
2216560	2224080	So you both just managed to roll clear as the tank comes crashing down and the glass
2224320	2230560	shatters, liquid comes pouring out the front and these things come flopping and
2230600	2233920	wriggling out from all over the place.
2235040	2239680	Let's have LUCK rolls off the two of you as you're both down on the ground beside this
2240040	2244040	to see whether any of the creatures take an interest in you.
2248560	2249240	Ought nine.
2249480	2252080	I fail a forty on a twenty five.
2252960	2258040	So Dr. Coombs, as he's lying there on the ground, trying to get his breath, having just
2258040	2265240	rolled out of the way, sees just the tail end of one of these spiny creatures
2265240	2268760	disappearing into his side and wriggling inside him.
2270160	2273560	Oh, I got one in me.
2273760	2274600	I got one in me.
2274800	2276200	Don't worry too much, Doc.
2276480	2281480	Obviously, you know, there's the fellow in the woods and probably a few back on the
2281480	2286720	camp. We're going to have to do this whole process at least one more time so we can get
2286720	2287320	that one out of you.
2288040	2297720	Dr. Rothstein is obviously trying to maintain the containment as best he can, I guess.
2297720	2302200	Yeah, he, once it got flipped on, was just awestruck by it.
2302200	2307640	And he remembers the conversations that he had had with with Hawk about stuff like this.
2307640	2310120	And he's just amazed that it's right there in front of him.
2310680	2316360	And then he hears a giant crash and focuses on, like, maintaining the portal.
2316640	2322040	So far, the containment seems to be OK.
2322280	2330200	You do notice that you can't actually see the ring in the ground anymore and that every
2330200	2335000	now and then out of the corner of your eye, you can see just shifts in the air around
2335000	2340000	you as if it's not all just happening within the center of the room.
2340280	2344800	That freaks him out a little bit, but he, I guess, kind of still skimming through the
2344800	2349520	book, looking for any notes about how to change it or anything.
2350280	2353880	Yeah, I mean, there's all sorts of ideas in there, but it looks like whoever has been
2353880	2363360	writing these notes has changed his mind so often that it's proving not very useful.
2365160	2372760	Whoever it is who's been maintaining Hawk's work since then does not seem to really fully
2372760	2374400	grasp how all this works.
2374800	2379800	I'm going to start helping throw worms into it, into the center then.
2381800	2391800	OK, then let's put this down then to whichever one of you would like to make a DEX
2391800	2397600	roll, who's busy throwing these things in, just to see how long it takes you to wrangle
2397600	2400520	all these creatures and throw them into the center.
2400800	2401720	I've got a 50.
2401720	2402560	I've got a 50.
2402560	2403760	I've got a 70.
2403960	2405440	Would I be able to take part in this?
2405840	2409520	Yeah, I assume you're all just throwing these creatures in.
2409960	2410240	Yeah.
2410400	2412000	So, yeah, let's have Dr.
2412000	2412840	Coons do it.
2415600	2417800	I pass a 58 on a 70.
2417800	2425440	OK, that's good, because what you notice as you're throwing the creatures in is that the
2425440	2431000	other creatures you can see within the zone or whatever it is that's being created.
2431400	2435600	And it's difficult to read their intentions like you would animals, because you can't
2435600	2440000	really hear them and they don't necessarily behave in the same way.
2440720	2445440	But you're seeing what you consider to be perhaps some kind of flock behavior or
2446120	2453040	certainly the kind of behavior you might see in birds or fish or whatever that are
2453040	2458600	beginning to look agitated and moving in formation away from maybe some approaching
2458600	2459240	predator.
2461000	2462120	Oh, shit.
2462440	2464440	What's Inside Out Monkey doing?
2464440	2466040	Did he get into the portal already?
2466200	2469160	It's just flopping on the ground at the moment.
2469520	2472160	It's bigger.
2472640	2479200	And so it's just, yeah, it doesn't look like it's very mobile outside of a liquid
2479200	2479960	environment.
2480120	2481720	I'm trying to kick it into the center.
2482400	2483800	You're kicking it into the center.
2484160	2485680	Oh, OK, good.
2486120	2486840	Right.
2486840	2487320	Then...
2493080	2494280	You love to see it.
2495680	2505160	OK, as you kick it, it doesn't seem very happy about this and it lets out what you
2505160	2511720	think is probably a scream of pain, or at least that's what you get for the first
2511720	2513080	couple of seconds of it.
2514080	2519720	But the sound, it does something to your brain as you hear it, and you can just hear
2520440	2525880	or feel your brain just shutting down in response to this sensory overload that's
2525880	2528560	coming out of this pained creature.
2529480	2532360	Yeah, I would like everyone to make power rolls, please.
2540800	2542640	66 on a 40.
2543240	2546280	I failed 79 on a 40.
2546520	2548760	I passed with a 34 on a 40.
2549160	2550880	Extreme pass, ought to.
2551200	2557040	OK, so two of you are just, you're having to fight through this pain and confusion
2557040	2564440	and you can see that your two companions have just dropped the ground and are just
2564680	2573200	sitting or lying there looking vacantly as this thing sings or screams or whatever.
2574960	2581240	But yeah, with that, I mean, you've got enough time that if you want, you can just
2581640	2587560	finish the job of kicking it in or shoving it in through the barrier.
2588080	2589480	Guys, you should try kicking it.
2594440	2597920	Frederick Mellon will kick it.
2598280	2604480	OK, and with a good punt, then, yeah, he goes, well, not quite sailing through the
2604480	2608400	air, it's a bit big for that, but you managed to shove it and as it disappears
2608480	2613360	into the the center of the room, then the sound stops.
2614360	2619920	Your two companions, however, are still sitting on the ground looking quite glassy eyed.
2620880	2621600	I'll kick them.
2624920	2628640	I want to approach Carl because he's the one who's running this machine where he's
2628640	2630360	going to be the one that we need to turn it off.
2630360	2634800	So I'm rushing over to him and maybe like shaking him by the shoulders.
2634800	2636520	Carl, Carl, you with us?
2637200	2639280	We're going to need you to turn off this machine here pretty soon.
2639520	2642200	And Carl is not responding in the slightest.
2643400	2650240	I am going to grab forceps and try to pull the creature that went into Coombes
2650240	2652800	earlier and then put it into Rothstein.
2654440	2666440	So, yeah, you grab the forceps and you did see where the creature went in.
2667040	2670920	So, Coombes, remember earlier we learned that they do the power.
2670920	2672440	They suck it out of your body.
2672440	2675160	We got to get the one that went in when you screamed earlier.
2675160	2676200	We got to get it out of here.
2676200	2677400	We got to put it in Rothstein.
2677400	2679840	That way his eyes come back from the glassiness, OK?
2679840	2681880	Just long enough for him to turn off the machine, right?
2681920	2683240	Then we get it out of him, too, right?
2683480	2684000	Enjoy.
2685240	2686040	All right, all right.
2686040	2690320	And I hold my arms up, giving him ample angle.
2690520	2699400	Yeah, sure enough, you start fishing around inside the now molten flesh of Dr.
2699400	2707160	Coombes, sticking your forceps in through his side and just digging around until you
2707160	2713160	grab hold of something that you maybe hope isn't his pancreas and start pulling.
2713240	2718320	I got it.
2718640	2728040	So, for Dr. Coombes, can you roll a d3 twice, please?
2729200	2731160	This could be very, very bad for you.
2734680	2738520	I got a 1 and a 3.
2739520	2745600	OK, so you lose 10 points of power and you lose 30 luck.
2745960	2747160	That's more luck than I have.
2747160	2747760	Does that matter?
2748080	2749120	Or it just goes to zero?
2749120	2750520	You die instantly.
2750600	2752080	Your luck is now zero.
2752080	2755200	So your group luck roll now is zero.
2756120	2757560	Just putting that out there.
2758720	2759440	Perfect.
2759440	2760640	Kick him into the circle.
2760960	2762840	I just wanted to get that pressure off you, Thomas.
2762840	2764240	That's all that was.
2764720	2765680	You're a good friend, Joe.
2768560	2773760	OK, so, yeah, you can sort of see some of the life draining out of Dr.
2773760	2777720	Coombes as you drag this screaming, thrashing creature out of him.
2778360	2780760	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
2782440	2788360	Yeah, his skin definitely looks drier and flakier and he just looks older somehow.
2788960	2790080	Oh, that one got a lot.
2790080	2791160	He's about to crumble.
2794080	2796040	I'm very thirsty.
2796040	2802960	And I'm going to kick Rothstein over and lift up his shirt.
2803520	2808240	OK, so he's on his back and you're dropping the creature into, I'm
2808240	2809440	going to, I'm not going to drop it.
2809440	2811560	I'm going to hold onto it in the forceps.
2812080	2815600	OK, and you're placing, you're placing it inside his body.
2815800	2818960	I mean, it's what the man who I killed said to do.
2819240	2824120	Yeah, I mean, you're going to have to release it because until it burrows
2824120	2829560	its way into his body, his flesh isn't in that state where you can get the
2829560	2833480	forceps in, at least not without cutting him open and gouging him.
2833760	2835160	I'm going to try it first.
2835960	2838680	I'm going to try it first where the forceps keep just like...
2838680	2839920	Poking him really hard.
2843080	2844320	Oh, God.
2846280	2848240	Casper Brink, you dumb piece of shit.
2850560	2853040	But eventually you do manage to get the creature into him.
2853880	2856480	I'm going to wait until his eyes come back and then I'm going
2856560	2857960	going right into his belly.
2858840	2867160	Dr. Rothstein can gain 10 points of power and 10 points of luck as this
2867160	2869240	creature wriggles its way inside him.
2869400	2874120	And yeah, I suppose with that, with that jolt of energy, you do start
2874120	2875480	to come out of your fugue state.
2875880	2878680	Oh my, I feel fantastic.
2878840	2880240	Frederick Mellon is just screaming.
2880360	2882760	I like to think the entire time this is happening.
2882760	2892880	He's just, let me, let me get a fresh set of eyes on these knobs and stuff.
2893680	2894800	Mellon's still screaming.
2894880	2898560	I was about to say, let's have a group luck roll to see what's happened
2898680	2901320	with the containment while Dr.
2901320	2902680	Rothstein's been unconscious.
2903000	2904800	But of course we know what your group luck roll is now, don't we?
2904800	2906360	But then you remember it would be pointless.
2906360	2910080	So as Dr.
2910080	2915200	Rothstein is coming out of this fugue state, he can see, yeah, that this, this
2915200	2921560	area of otherness is spreading and has, you know, is now pushing up against where
2921560	2925680	you are and it looks like it's almost about to engulf your feet where you're
2925680	2926800	lying on the ground.
2926960	2935440	You can also see now that all the smaller creatures have fled and there is the
2935440	2940240	shadow or the outline of something very large coming your way.
2940720	2944600	The scream turns into, shut it off, shut it off, shut it off, shut it off.
2944920	2946880	I jump up and shut it off.
2947200	2952880	Yeah, as you're jumping up and trying to shut this off before whatever it is
2952920	2957680	reaches you, let's have a DEX roll to see whether you can do this nice and quickly.
2957880	2958880	Can I try to help him up?
2958920	2961760	I got a 13 on a 50.
2961920	2963080	Oh, so, yeah.
2963160	2966960	I whack your hand away from me and you're helping a ghost, man.
2966960	2967960	He's already gone.
2971120	2971440	I do.
2971440	2974480	I lean down and try to help him up when he's standing on the other side.
2975120	2977160	Yeah, I just flip the switch.
2977520	2977920	Yeah.
2977920	2983320	And, and I mean, the rest of you can see that there, yeah, there is something just
2983320	2992800	huge that is just beginning to move into the center of the room and just pushing
2992800	2995440	beyond the bounds of the containment here.
2995800	3000480	And there's something that is reaching out towards you.
3000840	3003720	And then just all of a sudden, the knife switch goes click.
3005000	3009240	And there's just the metal ring in the center of the room, the stone floor.
3009520	3009840	Whoa.
3015120	3016520	Did it, did it work?
3017560	3018280	Are we all here?
3018480	3020040	Dolan is still dazed, right?
3020040	3022680	Dolan is beginning to come out of it now.
3023120	3025960	You've got no memory of what's just happened.
3026240	3026760	Yeah.
3027080	3031840	I mean, one moment, you know, the tank was going over and the next moment you're now
3031840	3035960	sitting here and everyone's in different positions and you're not really sure what
3035960	3036520	happened.
3036920	3038280	Dolan, are you with us?
3038560	3041160	Uh, park the car.
3041400	3042440	I'm not really sure.
3042880	3043880	Uh, park the car.
3043880	3046560	We parked the car halfway down the driveway.
3046560	3047480	It's facing out.
3047480	3048960	That way we can get out quickly.
3049120	3049800	Are they gone?
3049920	3051880	Uh, did we, did we do it?
3052080	3054200	Uh, yeah, we've solved everything.
3054600	3056280	But how do you like them apples?
3060000	3062920	Oh, except for we don't have the two missing kids.
3063840	3066440	You know, that was always going to be icing on the cake, I think.
3066480	3066760	Yeah.
3066760	3068400	We don't have the two missing kids.
3068440	3073760	And also I'm sure there's a lot of squeamy things out there in the woods that seem to
3073960	3074840	still be out there.
3074840	3076920	There's that guy that's fucked up.
3078000	3080440	I can't, not on this, not on this one.
3080920	3088960	And, uh, and, uh, yeah, I can't think of anything else, uh, left to do with anybody
3088960	3089800	around here.
3089840	3092920	We, we will have to do this again.
3092920	3093200	Right.
3093240	3096400	We're going to have to open the portal again to get for the things that are in
3096400	3100360	Nancy and, uh, yeah, the other one.
3100360	3103800	And then the, you know, that guy in the woods just seemed to be silly with them.
3103800	3107640	So, uh, we might just have to throw him all the way in there.
3107760	3108920	Didn't we buoyant some though?
3109080	3109560	It's true.
3109560	3110160	That's true.
3110480	3110640	Yeah.
3110640	3112440	We could just burn that fellow alive.
3112720	3117800	I honestly don't think I want to take the risk of having that giant, giant thing at
3117800	3118520	the end there.
3118560	3124920	Did you see the, the, the, the, and like words being to fail him as he really just
3124920	3129280	has no idea how to describe what was reaching out there at the end, right
3129280	3130760	before it came down.
3130760	3135960	You just see in his eyes, like, uh, the twinkle of constellations unknown.
3136240	3139880	I don't have any recollection of that, but if you saw some kind of terrible
3139880	3144040	shadow moving towards you through the thing, you know, presumably it would just
3144040	3144560	move on.
3144840	3149960	Like if we did it in 15 minutes, I don't, you know, 20, you know, an hour is still
3149960	3151640	going to be waiting around for that portal.
3151640	3154200	It saw no, it's going to be eating fishes somewhere else.
3154360	3160040	Do you guys think that we should, uh, destroy this then if we're going to, if
3160040	3163640	we're just going to burn the remaining ones, should we, should we destroy this
3163640	3164080	machine?
3164560	3165000	Yeah.
3165200	3167520	Are we on team burn the remaining ones?
3167560	3168720	No, we keep the machine.
3168720	3176160	It's very, uh, I might make use of it, uh, to repurpose it.
3176200	3177240	In what way, Doc?
3177320	3179680	Uh, I won't, it will be safe.
3181560	3183920	I don't know if we can trust this thing existing.
3183960	3185520	I mean, we've seen what it can do.
3185520	3188720	That's, that's, there's no way that that can be used for good, right?
3189200	3191320	Ultimately it should absolutely be destroyed.
3191360	3193600	I'm just saying, are we done destroying things with it?
3194120	3196320	We should probably at least look at the lights in the house, right?
3196400	3198440	Well, we got to go check out the lights in the house.
3198720	3200240	We still got to find the kids.
3200240	3201520	We've got to find Billy and Esther.
3201720	3202160	Yeah.
3202480	3203320	And the closer.
3203400	3205240	How did you wake me up?
3205280	3206920	How did you make me feel so good?
3210240	3211840	Uh, you just kind of snapped out of it.
3212640	3214360	Oh, fantastic.
3216360	3218240	Well, nothing left to do there.
3219280	3220320	Well, great.
3220760	3221560	No, I'm just kidding.
3221560	3222200	Lay down.
3222960	3223440	What?
3224000	3228560	I want you to lay down, lift up your shirt, and then I want you to do not
3228560	3230440	look, do not look down.
3230440	3232640	I immediately lift my shirt up and look.
3233520	3234120	Okay.
3234320	3236400	If you get it, did it eat its way inside me?
3236960	3237800	Don't press.
3237880	3240480	Don't, don't you dare press your fingers right above your belly.
3240480	3242560	Press my finger right above my belly then.
3243040	3243680	Okay.
3243680	3248600	And, and your fingers sink right through your skin into your flesh.
3248640	3250960	There's no ripping or tearing at the flesh.
3251520	3255560	It's just like putting your fingers into a bowl of warm oatmeal.
3255560	3262120	Oh, I immediately pull my hand out and I'm like, go ghost white.
3262120	3263440	And flick the oatmeal off.
3264080	3264320	Yeah.
3264320	3268360	Let's have a sanity roll for that as you have just probed the
3268360	3269720	inside of your own abdomen.
3271400	3272720	I got a 69.
3273360	3274000	A fail.
3274520	3276240	So that's going to be a D4 San.
3278720	3279800	Did you say 69?
3280920	3281320	Yeah.
3281320	3281680	Yeah.
3283200	3286360	Do we, do we want to tell Scott about a really immature house rule?
3290240	3292480	Which is that that's a crit success.
3297040	3297280	Yeah.
3297280	3299160	Usually I'm happy to see that number, but.
3301560	3305160	I'm not going to force Scott to roll with our 69 as a
3305160	3306760	critical success house rule.
3306760	3316880	I am happy to, when in Rome, I shall embrace the 69.
3316880	3318400	When in Rome, 69.
3320840	3321200	Okay.
3321240	3323640	In which case, yeah, you, you don't lose any San.
3336760	3362880	Sorry.
3362880	3365640	Just trying to get 30 minutes of silence to really get the
3365760	3370320	noise quiet meditation time.
3370320	3370840	Shut up.
3372680	3373040	Sorry.
3373040	3376600	I had, uh, I had a bunch of fans going that I had to go turn on.
3378720	3379000	Okay.
3379000	3382440	Well then let's get 30 seconds of silence from Thomas.
3382560	3385760	Uh, cause it'll way over compress.
3385760	3389120	If it's trying to cut out the fans that are no longer there.
3389320	3390360	You guys can talk about it.
3390400	3392320	Yeah, but you can't.
3392440	3395560	Can we get a verbal confirmation that you understand?
3396640	3396840	Yeah.
3403560	3404960	Without Thomas able to talk.
3405000	3408120	Is there a point in the rest of us speaking to each other?
3408720	3409640	Can't think of any.
3410680	3417080	Well, not apart from to taunt Thomas, but anyone got any good taunts?
3418480	3419880	You look like you can't swim.
3421440	3422000	I can swim.
3423160	3423720	I can swim.
3423720	3425520	I've put on a lot of weight lately though.
3425520	3429160	So you could float better.
3430400	3431920	No, it just, that's a place you guys could go.
3437720	3441640	Dude, there was a, uh, I'm ashamed to start a story with this, but there
3441640	3443640	was a tic talk the other day that I saw.
3444360	3446240	But it's just this guy.
3447240	3450440	Considering your, your internet culture consumption, that could have
3450440	3452000	been like a billion times worse.
3452320	3457480	Yeah, but, uh, it's this guy just like messing with his brother.
3457480	3462080	He's like, dude, you just look like you like have never bowled a strike.
3462400	3466880	And he's like, just like gets irrationally upset, like arguing.
3466880	3468920	He's like, dude, I have my own ball.
3469160	3473880	Like just getting really mad.
3473880	3476600	And I'm like, that is a hilarious insult.
3476640	3479760	Like do you see Thomas's eyes were darting around?
3479760	3481840	He was trying to remember if he'd ever.
3481840	3485120	I don't, I don't know if I have, I don't bowl that often.
3486000	3489080	Um, I don't think I've bowled a strike in my adult life.
3489560	3494640	You, you have, I was there and it was because we were all bowling and you asked
3494640	3498320	Ben to give you a tip and he's told you about the bringing the hand up and
3498320	3502000	touching the ear and the very next ball you rolled was a strike and we all were
3502000	3506480	like, Ben knows how to bowl and knows how to teach people how to bowl that.
3506480	3506840	Wow.
3506840	3509080	You're telling me I just had to touch my ears this whole time.
3509120	3514160	He's a teacher now, which is great, but I don't, I have never remembered that tip.
3514200	3515480	So he's probably not a good one.
3516360	3520040	I'm assuming you let go of the bowl, the bowl before touching your ear, because
3520040	3521280	otherwise that's going to smart, right?
3521280	3521800	Correct.
3521840	3522720	Yeah, correct.
3522720	3525040	That, that would hurt quite a bit.
3526480	3529200	No, you actually bowl best with a concussion.
3529200	3536080	So that's the, so actually my high game, I was on pain medication and wearing a
3536080	3542880	boot on my ankle because I had like fractured a bone in my foot, but my family
3542880	3548040	still decided that our outing that Saturday was going to be bowling.
3548400	3549000	No, exactly.
3549000	3549960	You can, you can do it.
3550440	3550960	I bet.
3551600	3552960	And I was like, yeah, okay.
3552960	3557920	So I like would waddle up and I bowled seven strikes in a row to start off the
3557920	3558160	game.
3559440	3559920	Hell yeah.
3560240	3565720	I don't remember it all exactly, but I do remember I left a couple open frames
3565720	3566760	there upsetting.
3567120	3570360	So the secret to good bowling is to be smacked off your tits.
3570760	3571000	Yep.
3571080	3572200	I think that's about right.
3572240	3573320	That's the takeaway for sure.
3573360	3575000	That is not what I found to be true.
3578600	3578800	Yeah.
3578800	3581640	My highest I ever bowled was a two Oh two.
3582000	3585360	I had to go to Instagram to look cause I was so proud of myself.
3586600	3587160	That's good.
3587840	3588680	That is good.
3588680	3589480	Yeah, that's really good.
3589480	3595880	My high game was two 47, but my previous high game was like 160.
3595960	3600720	So I've never bowled in between 160 and two 47.
3601000	3601720	That's crazy.
3601720	3605480	When I worked at the order, I picked up some, some tips from Jake that made me a
3605480	3607640	much better bowler and it made it really fun.
3609480	3614600	It's fun to be good at something fun to play it when you're good at it.
3614680	3619080	But he taught me how to do the like spinny curve throw game changer.
3619480	3621160	Plus it's way more fun to do it that way.
3621480	3624560	When you get the hang of it, that it does, it feels really good when you
3624560	3628880	get the spin thing working and you can just like throw the ball at the pans.
3629200	3630880	That's a good strategy.
3631000	3633160	As long as you knock them all down, you got to just touch your ear.
3633160	3634080	And that's what I've always said.
3635480	3639760	So, um, we, so Luke run it back for me.
3639800	3642280	Um, we went to the house.
3642760	3643280	We did.
3643680	3646200	Uh, what was the house called the house?
3646600	3648880	Yeah, we've talked about this while you were on the line.
3648880	3651520	The home who must be named the name of the scenario.
3652360	3654080	Bleak Oh, prospect.
3654520	3654920	Yes.
3656840	3657520	I yep.
3657880	3658400	Good.
3658440	3662240	Uh, I was just testing you guys to see that you remembered
3662240	3663400	that there was a name for it.
3663720	3665040	We went to prospect thing.
3665040	3665560	We passed.
3665640	3665880	Yeah.
3665880	3668440	Otherwise I would have refused to do the rest of the recap.
3670320	3676040	So we went to prospect, uh, after, before, before we went there though,
3676040	3679720	we, uh, the slugs escaped, right?
3680960	3682240	Kinda kind of.
3682240	3682480	Yeah.
3683720	3688680	We went back to the, um, not the, like the camp or whatever.
3688720	3689760	The Herbert town.
3690000	3690600	Yes.
3695400	3696600	Are they called Hoover towns?
3696600	3697440	Cause they suck.
3699680	3700920	I love vacuum humor.
3701440	3702440	And then we went to the house.
3702440	3705720	We did some sort of portal, uh, broke a fish tank.
3705960	3706840	There's a monkey.
3711000	3711480	Yeah.
3712040	3716640	This is going to be, I mean, I'm probably going to edit this out for sure,
3717720	3721960	especially because this will be in the same episode as what just happened.
3724000	3724680	Incredible.
3724840	3726960	We're coming in in the middle of an episode here,
3727200	3734040	but I think we'd left it that you just sort of finished everything that you
3734040	3736200	wanted to do in the laboratory.
3736600	3741600	And that your plan now was to go to the main house and see whether you could
3741600	3743560	find out what had happened to the kids.
3743600	3743880	Right.
3743880	3748720	I remember, if nothing else, that the kids were our next plan of attack.
3749560	3751160	Yeah, we're going to go attack those kids.
3753520	3756720	Well, it is now fully dark outside.
3757240	3761720	There is, however, some light because when you switched the generators on, you
3761720	3765400	switched on some lights within Prospect itself.
3766200	3769280	There isn't a lot of light coming out.
3769280	3772000	It's not like every light in the place is now blazing.
3772320	3773480	But there are a few.
3773880	3780440	Now, you're around the side of the building at the moment, so you're pretty much
3780440	3784160	equidistant from both the front and the back entrances.
3784600	3791000	With the new lights on, do we see any movement or signs of life within the house?
3791120	3795560	Yeah, there is a light on upstairs, a fairly faint one.
3796240	3804680	You don't see any movement, but the window, yeah, the window looks a bit weird from down
3804680	3811320	here. It looks like it's got perhaps some strangely colored curtains across it, some
3811320	3814040	very moist looking curtains.
3814040	3826800	I've seen a lot of acquaintance in my day, but none that look oh, is that you can tell
3826800	3828400	the thick and heavy with moisture?
3829560	3834640	Yeah, but are they thick and heavy like cloth is thick and heavy when it's got moisture
3834640	3836280	on it, or is it more thick and heavy?
3836280	3838280	Like he's an older gentleman.
3838600	3841200	Let's say he's got that like turkey neck thing going on.
3841200	3845880	So he just kind of grabs it as gobbler and he's like, oh, is it more like, and he just
3845880	3851160	starts kind of shaking around the like part by his Adam's apple, just kind of violently
3851160	3856080	making a kind of a wet slapping noise of the skin against his Adam's apple.
3856200	3858120	Uh, skin draperies?
3860240	3865800	I mean, the answer really is neither.
3867160	3867800	Oh, good.
3868120	3874120	Yeah, no, it doesn't quite seem to be those things.
3874480	3878440	I've seen a lot of a lot of skin in my in my time as a doctor.
3878880	3880880	That doesn't look like skin curtains to me.
3880880	3882280	I don't know why you would have floated that.
3882320	3884960	That's kind of an out there thing to kind of jump to the conclusion.
3884960	3887760	I'm kind of losing it a little bit, obviously.
3887800	3888880	What's your first name?
3888920	3890400	For some reason, I can't remember.
3890400	3893040	It's Doc out here, Doc, and it's hard to tell.
3893040	3898320	It's Nathaniel, you really can remember that?
3898320	3899360	Let me let me take a look at you.
3899400	3900480	Did you get hit?
3900520	3901560	Are you all right?
3901680	3905640	It feels like months have passed between the last moment we saw each other and now.
3907680	3911120	Yes, I wonder if I'll have the same accent.
3913280	3914280	It sounds better.
3915200	3925120	Okay, so if it's not my turkey neck that's hung up in the windows, then I feel a little bit safer going in there.
3925120	3930600	Doctor, now that you've told me that you've seen skin that ain't skin, then yeah.
3930640	3931080	Okay.
3931160	3932520	Are we going in the front of the back?
3932520	3937960	Because they might expect us in the back, because if we're supposed to be sneaky, then we would go in the back.
3937960	3938240	Right.
3938240	3941600	And they clearly know something's up because we turned on the power.
3942000	3943000	What about a window?
3943000	3943600	What's it about?
3943800	3945440	Yeah, God damn it.
3945440	3946000	I was doing you.
3946000	3947840	Yeah, a window.
3951640	3953040	Yeah, I think that's a good idea, Luke.
3953040	3954240	Why don't we look for a window down here?
3955400	3956000	Thank you.
3956200	3959240	One thing I was going to say, though, is Dr.
3959240	3969320	Coons can attempt to spot hidden role, actually, because unlike the others, you have a bit of medical knowledge that you can draw upon here that might help.
3969560	3970640	I will give it a shot.
3972440	3973280	I...
3974280	3975000	Oh, shit.
3975000	3975760	I don't pass.
3975760	3977840	It's a 27 on a 25.
3977960	3979800	You could spend two points of luck.
3980360	3981760	I ain't got no luck, boys.
3981800	3983800	That was one of the things that happened last session.
3984320	3985280	Oh, yes.
3985440	3986080	Yes.
3988640	3989280	Shit.
3989320	3990080	Does that mean our...
3990080	3990960	You've reminded Scott.
3990960	3992680	...group luck roles are now at zero?
3992720	3993720	Yup.
3996280	3998320	Guess who's about to call for a luck role?
3998720	4004720	Well, I guess it doesn't matter if I spend some of my precious 13 points anymore, because it can't affect the group.
4005120	4006280	Can I help him with that role?
4006280	4006800	You can't.
4006800	4007640	With some of my luck, or...?
4007640	4009200	No, no, you can't.
4009200	4022640	But what I will say is that, and it's difficult to tell what you're looking at through that window upstairs, because there's condensation on the inside of the window, and there's definitely something obfuscating the view.
4023240	4032200	But, yeah, there's something about the color and the texture of what you're looking at in the window that is just tickling the back of your brain.
4032520	4036480	But you just can't get a good enough view to really work out what it is.
4037040	4040640	There's something up with what's going on in that window up there.
4041120	4044840	I don't think it's skin, but there's something odd about it.
4045440	4047800	It's tickling the back of my brain.
4047800	4049320	It's fucking kooky, that's for sure.
4049560	4050720	Look at the color of it.
4050760	4052640	I prefer not to.
4053120	4054720	I don't want to look at this thing at all.
4054720	4062800	I don't know if it's kookier or spookier, but I think we should be looking for a window that doesn't have these sort of abnormally wet...
4062800	4064560	These kooky, spooky curtains.
4064560	4064960	Yeah.
4064960	4066800	Exactly, exactly.
4066800	4070640	Maybe it's a fluky curtain, too, and there's more that don't have them.
4070720	4075960	Are there any windows on the bottom floor that don't have the spooky curtains?
4076200	4076720	Thanks, Luke.
4077120	4078520	There certainly are.
4079320	4085320	The windows are shuttered, but it wouldn't take much to pry the shutters away.
4085480	4093920	Yeah, if you head around the side of the building a little bit, you can see that there are a few windows at Grand Devil here that you could investigate.
4094200	4096120	Hey, guys, I found one.
4096240	4099600	OK, but like, do we even have a plan?
4100160	4101040	Get inside.
4101720	4104040	Yeah, but what happens when we get inside?
4104120	4105520	We save the kids, cue in on.
4106520	4109360	Explore, save the kids, get out.
4109520	4111160	What if we run into trouble?
4111400	4112480	We are the storm.
4115520	4120240	We made a portal already today, so we can do anything.
4120240	4121600	I like this guy's optimism.
4121760	4123720	We can't do anything we put our mind to, Doc.
4123960	4125000	You're absolutely right.
4125520	4126840	Let's let's get in there.
4126840	4128400	Let's save these fucking kids.
4129560	4131640	Let's find a goddamn window we can open.
4131720	4135600	I start trying to pry the boards off the window.
4135840	4137440	OK, well, it's not boarded up.
4137440	4146200	It's like I say, shutters, which have largely been put in place, but you don't really need to make a roll or anything.
4146200	4152000	There's a bit of creaking and grunting as you pull these rusted shutters away.
4152360	4155560	And there is some light on inside.
4155560	4159320	You can see that you're looking into a room.
4159560	4173960	Yeah, I mean, it's obviously a room, but the walls are covered with wallpaper or paint of some description that is glistening,
4174280	4180640	that it's sort of reddish purple and there's liquid trickling down it.
4180640	4189600	Maybe we see if another room in this house isn't quite so kooky and spooky.
4191080	4195760	This one seems to have a lot of the same vibes as that, the moist curtains.
4195840	4204360	Now, we already spent the volume, you know, when you're breaking into a house, you really want to only break in through one place.
4204760	4211960	That way, they, you know, if they hear you coming in through the first place, then they wouldn't be able to.
4214960	4216000	Fredrik, are you OK?
4216120	4216800	You're really?
4216800	4220520	Yeah, no, it's really early for you.
4222960	4225480	Let me let me help you up into the window.
4226280	4229560	And I like offer him my hands to step into.
4229560	4240440	Zach's tired, so if we just suggest thanks for his character, we can kind of we can kind of canary him through all these doors.
4244440	4246800	Here I go through the window.
4246840	4254680	OK, well, the window frame, you look at it, you don't think it's locked.
4254680	4262160	But when you try pushing the sash window up, there's resistance.
4262520	4276960	And as you do so, there's a sort of noise and there's something sort of wet and rubbery around the bottom of it that just pulls the window back down as you pull it up.
4277240	4286720	And just for a moment, you get a blast of warm, moist air come out that fogs in the cold air.
4288240	4303840	And there's a smell to it, maybe not an entirely repellent smell, but yeah, there's certainly some nasty undertones to it, but mostly it's is kind of warm and moist and meaty.
4303840	4308160	This goddamn house is fucking alive.
4311080	4315880	The squelching stuff that brought it back down is was it was it literally there?
4316640	4320400	If we had if we had a knife or something, could we could we could we cut it away?
4320480	4325680	Yeah, I mean, looking at it, I mean, it perhaps reminds you a little bit of kind of bubble gum, maybe.
4325920	4327480	Does does anybody have a knife?
4327480	4329440	We could we could we can get our way in here.
4329680	4331880	No, but my fingers are due for bubble gum.
4332880	4340160	This is just like some nasty smelling bubble gum that they're trying to keep the windows closed so that it's a weird sort of way.
4340160	4349120	I've never seen a house like this with a security system that uses bubble gum on the exterior of the interior of all the rooms to try to keep everything closed.
4349120	4352040	But I figure I could chew it away, probably.
4352960	4354320	Guys, two things.
4354320	4359960	One, I think we obviously let Freddie keep volunteering for all this all this dangerous shit.
4360480	4364160	But then to Freddie, I love your enthusiasm.
4364160	4370920	Maybe go back to your original plan of the hands, not just eating the bubble gum, because I don't think that's bubble gum.
4371320	4373720	But also, why don't you use my knife?
4374440	4380680	So Frederick Millen I takes the knife and will open up the window once more.
4380680	4391440	And as he slowly opens it up, he'll slide the blade just in between the window and the threshold and just kind of like, slide it along.
4391640	4393880	Slide is probably optimistic.
4393880	4395680	It is more hacking.
4395920	4396720	Ah, yes.
4396720	4400120	Well, Frederick Millen I is nothing if not optimistic.
4400520	4401760	I thought you were going to say a hack.
4401760	4402880	I thought you were too.
4402880	4418520	But yeah, with a bit of elbow grease, you can gouge away and there is fluid now bubbling down over the edge of the windowsill.
4419040	4429920	And inside the house, you can hear what sounds like a creaking, groaning sound coming from deep within.
4430920	4435120	And just for a moment, the wall shakes and trembles.
4435680	4436480	After you, Freddie.
4437640	4438280	I'm in.
4440360	4445240	As you cut the last of it away, you get the window up, you can climb in.
4445440	4453960	What I do want is not a CLIMB roll, but just the DEX roll, I think, just to see how gracefully you can do this.
4454000	4460200	Because what you realize as you're clambering through is everything inside is slippery as fuck.
4461160	4462920	Extreme success.
4463160	4465640	I rolled a 12 on a 65.
4465640	4466640	Fantastic.
4466640	4467080	Nice.
4468080	4482120	OK, then, yeah, despite the fact that you're coming in on what is a window ledge and then there's maybe a few bits jutting out of the floor that once upon a time were furniture,
4482160	4487560	but are now again covered with this pulsating pinkish purple stuff.
4488120	4493560	I mean, despite that, you've managed to land on your feet and not slip over the floor.
4493840	4499120	The floor is also covered with all of this, plus a few inches of fluid.
4499320	4501800	Yeah, it is incredibly slippery.
4502320	4505280	Hey, guys, it's like an ice skating rink in the air.
4506000	4508160	Now that you're inside and get a good look at all this.
4508160	4509600	You've got to be really careful.
4509920	4512160	I would like a sansi roll.
4512640	4517280	Oh, yeah, because you're in the meat house.
4517520	4519240	Sixty two on a sixty four.
4519480	4522040	OK, then, yeah, you don't lose any.
4522600	4529320	It's just a very wet, very squelchy, very slippery room.
4529320	4530360	Completely normal.
4530360	4532520	Thomas, Doc, Doc, Doc, Doc.
4534160	4536280	Can you hear anything from where you are?
4536280	4541360	Yeah, I can hear groaning coming from deep within the house.
4542280	4544440	Doesn't sound like missing children, but.
4544720	4546840	And then he just kind of shrugs his shoulders.
4547920	4551480	If you wanted to try to discern more than that, you could give me a listen roll.
4551520	4552600	Give me a second.
4552600	4555280	I'm going to try to discern more than that.
4555280	4558880	I rolled a sixty seven on a fifty, so that's a fail.
4559240	4561800	But he is going to like
4561800	4569880	he's going to try to slide across the room as quietly as possible to hear better,
4569880	4576240	because if he's further away from the three men and the outside, he might be able to hear better.
4576240	4580080	He pushes himself along the room.
4580080	4582520	Yeah, you can push the roll here.
4585960	4586520	I fail.
4586600	4587400	No.
4588640	4597040	Well, as you're pushing your way across the floor to try to find somewhere quieter away from the others,
4597320	4604360	you hit a bit of the floor, which it wasn't obvious because it's all covered with this
4604880	4607200	membranous whatever it is.
4607720	4615760	But there's a bit where you suddenly realize as you reach it that the wood underneath or the flooring underneath has rotted away.
4616280	4623200	And you work this out just as your foot goes straight through it with this sort of wet ripping sound.
4623560	4630360	And the next thing you know, you're up to your waist in the floor and desperately scrabbling, holding on,
4630360	4638200	trying to hold on to this as this wet, slippery surface as you are falling or slipping through this hole in the floor.
4638320	4644000	From down below you, you can smell this indescribable stench.
4644040	4650240	There are acid acrid vapors coming up, burning your eyes and this overpowering smell like
4651360	4655080	the worst septic tank you've ever smelt down below.
4656560	4657920	Oh, God.
4658160	4666680	Help, help, help, help, help, help, oh, God, oh, God, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.
4666680	4671280	Guys, while we're still all outside, do we help him or do we just leave him here?
4671680	4674400	You're a doctor.
4674400	4675840	You've got to help him.
4675920	4677160	I've got to get in there.
4677160	4678080	I've got to get in there. Give me a boost.
4678080	4678600	Give me a boost.
4678640	4679600	You're a doctor, too.
4679960	4681240	Not that kind of doctor.
4683600	4685960	OK, so, yeah, you can push Dr.
4685960	4687480	Coombes in through the window.
4687840	4693880	Again, you know, if you're going to try to avoid just sliding around helplessly, I do want to DEX roll.
4694520	4694960	Sure.
4697560	4700160	I fail, fail.
4700600	4701040	Push it.
4702200	4703840	But I want, yeah.
4705240	4709960	When I get up, I get a hand on something firm and my hand just slips right off.
4710360	4711080	Oh, damn.
4711800	4713960	And I'm kind of, I'm kind of wiggling, rolling through.
4713960	4720640	And I'm going to try and restabilize myself by grabbing hold of the window frame and getting a better purchase on everything there.
4721400	4722120	Oh, OK.
4722680	4723600	And then I pass.
4724080	4724600	Oh, good.
4725200	4731480	Because otherwise that was going to set off a motherfucker of a chain reaction.
4740240	4748400	But, OK, yes, you managed to grab hold of something that, yeah, from the general shape of it, you think might be a chair.
4748440	4755520	And certainly your fingers go through a couple of things that you hope are wooden struts and not, say, ribs.
4756160	4759760	But, yeah, holding on to it, you managed to get yourself onto your feet.
4760400	4772080	You can see Freddy just about five feet away from you, just slowly slipping down this hole, his fingernails digging into this wet tissue, ripping holes in it.
4772520	4773840	But it's just so slippery.
4773840	4778120	He's just falling down in slow motion, inch by inch.
4778400	4785200	I want to try and anchor myself on the nearest solid object and reach for him.
4785440	4788440	It might be the frame of the window, if it's all.
4788520	4792840	If he's grabbing the frame of the window, I want to grab his arm from the outside.
4792840	4795360	OK, yeah, yeah, you can try to do that.
4795640	4798080	How tall up is, like, the window?
4798480	4804120	It's about three foot off the ground from within and about five foot off the ground from outside.
4804280	4807440	So I'm kind of reaching up and just trying to hold onto his hand.
4807720	4819000	OK, I think in order to give Freddy something to hold on to just because of the distance involved, the best thing you're going to be able to do is stick your leg out and hope that he can grab hold of your ankle.
4819160	4821040	Freddy, Freddy, grab on, grab on.
4821240	4826360	Then, yeah, I think Freddy can make a DEX roll here to see whether he can grab hold of Dr.
4826360	4829880	Coombes' ankle, because otherwise shit is going to get real.
4830680	4833960	Yes, 52 on a 65.
4834160	4849480	OK, yeah, you just managed to grab hold of the cuff of his rather frayed trousers and your fingers have got a firm grasp and you can just you can pull yourself up, you know, using it almost like a rope.
4849920	4858560	And there's this horrible, wet squelching sound as you're pulling yourself out of this hole and more of this hideous, hideous stench coming up.
4861000	4862640	Aw, look at my pants.
4864120	4866280	All right, let's let's get them both out of there, guys.
4866440	4868080	Carl, help me, help me pull them out.
4868160	4872720	I grab on to Thomas's waist and try to yank them out.
4872760	4873880	We got to go deeper.
4873920	4880080	When Freddy's close enough up onto me, I grab him up under the arms and kind of just tumble backwards out of the window with him.
4880120	4883760	Yeah, yeah. I mean, between you, you can get him back out through the window.
4884400	4890520	He is absolutely covered in just slime and bits of tissue and...
4890560	4892400	Not much different from his normal appearance.
4893400	4895040	Or me in seventh grade.
4897680	4903520	Dr. Coons, I think, can make an education roll here just to piece something together.
4907880	4910080	Pass, twenty four on an eighty.
4910120	4912800	So that's a that's the that's a good pass.
4913440	4916560	Yeah, that is what we call a good pass.
4916600	4917000	Yes.
4917000	4922960	It's the pass right before Easter.
4929680	4937760	So as Freddy's picking bits of this tissue off himself and you get a better look through the light that's coming out through the window.
4938440	4950160	Yeah, you can see there is something very much about this that reminds you of the lining of the large intestine.
4954320	4957240	Fellas, I don't I don't know how to how to say this.
4957280	4958640	Then maybe keep it to yourself.
4964600	4965400	We got to know.
4966280	4970680	This all looks it looks like it's it's it's the stuff that you use.
4970720	4972600	It's it's it's intestine.
4972640	4975240	It might have been trying to digest you in some way.
4975280	4976440	I don't I fucking knew it.
4976480	4977800	The house is alive.
4978040	4980920	It's a goddamn monster house written by Dan Harmon.
4981880	4984240	This is this is a lot bigger than we thought, boys.
4984360	4988920	Is there like a groundskeeping garage or home or anything?
4989040	4994720	Boys, here's what I think we got to do before we get back into the house is we got to put some hobnails on our boots.
4995400	5000240	So I literally just want to find nails to run through our shoes.
5000360	5002600	We're going to take our shoes off first, though, right?
5002760	5006080	Well, yeah, you're going to take the shoes off because you don't want to drive them through your feet.
5006360	5007200	Good point, Freddy.
5007360	5008840	OK, OK, thank you.
5008880	5012360	It's important to be clear when delineating a task.
5013400	5016120	So, yeah, you want to take your shoes off.
5016160	5019960	Step one, step two, you drive the nails through the bottom of the shoes.
5020120	5022000	Step three, you got sticky shoes.
5022240	5022880	I love it.
5022920	5026360	And then I think we could walk through this house with more ease.
5026400	5031280	What if we also become like, what would an intestine not like?
5031320	5040080	I could do some research on, but houses generally like to eat and then what they think is gross and then we become what is gross to them.
5040080	5041480	So it does not want to eat us.
5041680	5043000	Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, guys.
5043000	5048120	When when the body ingests something that is gross to it, it expels it.
5048280	5053520	So I don't think we want to be vomited out forcibly by this by this house.
5054240	5055640	So we want to be tasty?
5056000	5061360	I think we want to be I think we want to be as as as inconspicuous as possible.
5062440	5064040	Can a house be in devour?
5065320	5067400	This house is one hundred percent in devour.
5067440	5068960	We know it just tried to eat you.
5069080	5071160	You heard it groaning and creaking as it happened.
5071160	5071560	Come on.
5075840	5077600	This is a disgusting boar house.
5078120	5086880	Uh, Scott, the Good Friends of Jackson Elias podcast is a podcast about vore gaming in general.
5086960	5087480	Is that right?
5088080	5092280	Yeah, we wear our fetishes proud.
5095360	5097640	Hungry, hungry hippos really changed your life.
5101960	5102560	Oh, God.
5102560	5110720	So, yeah, if you're looking for nails to hammer through your shoes, if you poke around the
5110720	5116520	outside of the house a bit, you can find there are a couple of other outbuildings just
5116520	5121160	around the back. In fact, really just around the corner from where you are now that have
5121160	5129360	got all sorts of tools, a tool shed and a workshop that's obviously used for some
5129360	5129920	maintenance.
5129920	5130320	Rope?
5130400	5131560	Rope. Hmm.
5132200	5134920	I think this would be a good opportunity for a group luck roll.
5139080	5139720	Well, we can't.
5140320	5141240	Okay, Joe, come on.
5141240	5141640	Roll it.
5142440	5143320	Roll your luck, Joe.
5143800	5144200	You got it.
5145040	5147880	It's a, uh, oh, it's a eighty eight.
5150520	5153440	Oh, wait, you can still crit fail.
5156000	5160280	So there is some rope, but it is really badly rotted.
5160280	5164120	Do you think that it wouldn't stand any chance of supporting one of your weights?
5164840	5167240	Well, then it's a good thing there's a hose right here.
5168160	5170560	Yeah, I see it, too.
5173200	5176480	Yes, as long as that rubber hasn't perished, you'll be fine.
5176880	5179920	But we'll save the luck roll on that one for when you're actually in trouble.
5182920	5188400	Perfect. I was just picturing the four of us all tied together like ice, like mountain
5188400	5196280	climbers with the hobnails in our shoes, our lifeline, which is this crackly dry hose.
5198200	5203200	And then just like any random tools, I think, uh, would be necessary.
5203280	5203840	Yeah.
5203840	5207760	Hammers, saws, gasoline cutting implements in particular.
5207760	5208520	I think it'd be handy.
5208520	5209800	We could burn the house down.
5209840	5213600	I'd like to see if there's a very long, a flat bladed screwdriver.
5213960	5214320	Yeah.
5214320	5216480	I mean that there are going to be screwdrivers here.
5216480	5218040	I won't make you make a luck roll for that.
5218080	5220840	It's a workshop, there'll be screwdrivers.
5221120	5226680	As far as the gasoline's concerned, I mean, you do remember there were drums of diesel
5226760	5228400	out by the generator.
5228520	5228960	That's right.
5229080	5230320	I actually, I mean, Dr.
5230320	5237120	Rothstein would probably know this just through having worked with stuff like this
5237120	5237640	before.
5238080	5242680	If you're looking to set a fire, diesel is a really shit thing to use.
5243480	5243760	Yeah.
5243840	5245880	So I don't even mention it to the rest of the group.
5246200	5249360	If only we had some of that sweet, sweet, leaded gasoline around.
5250120	5252000	A cup a day keeps the doctor away.
5252920	5257200	That's a joke because leaded tastes sweet and there wasn't unleaded gasoline yet.
5257200	5259200	So, oh dude, that was fucking weird.
5261480	5262240	Yes, it was.
5263240	5264080	I knew Scott got it.
5264080	5265160	I just saw you guys like,
5268760	5274960	so now that you're all lashed together with perished hose and have nails through
5274960	5278000	your boots, what are you doing next?
5278240	5283920	Freddie, can you think back when you were being devoured, did you notice that was
5283920	5288000	there any place in that house that wasn't fleshy?
5288760	5290520	Was there any hardwoods anywhere?
5291200	5292320	You saw what I saw.
5292320	5297080	Just to give you some idea of what you saw just before you sort of started falling
5297080	5301240	through the floor, there were at least three other doors or at least three doors
5301240	5303360	rather in that room.
5303680	5305280	There was one that was ajar.
5306480	5310800	In fact, no, two of them were ajar, but two internal doors.
5311520	5316720	One of them seemed to go deeper within the house, possibly into a corridor.
5316960	5320320	And yeah, that looked almost as fleshy.
5321440	5326480	There was another door, which you reckon was just the back door leading outside.
5327680	5329640	We could just go through the back door.
5330600	5331120	Yeah.
5331120	5334440	I guess we could just open that door and look inside and see what we think.
5342040	5346400	Sounds a lot less life threatening than our first approach.
5346680	5350520	Uh, what order are we in and in our hose train?
5351040	5353360	Oh God, marching order, fuck sake.
5355880	5356400	Okay.
5356440	5358400	Well, someone's going to have to go in first.
5358720	5361200	It may as well be the one with foist in their name.
5363960	5364440	That's me.
5364440	5365520	I'm Frederick Mellon the foist.
5365520	5365800	Exactly.
5365800	5367560	I, uh, no objections.
5367840	5371000	But right now I feel more like Frederick Mellon the moist.
5376760	5380120	So just to be clear, you're going in through the back door.
5380200	5381960	You're, you're not going around the front.
5382040	5382360	Yeah.
5382440	5386720	I mean, opening up the back door again, isn't that difficult.
5386720	5392200	You do have to get the knife out and cut some of these strands of flesh away from
5392200	5395240	the door frame, but the door itself isn't locked.
5395600	5399640	And, you know, once again with a sort of squelching noise, you managed to pull it
5399640	5406400	open and yeah, inside you can see what do you now reckon must be the kitchen?
5406960	5410680	I mean, it's difficult to tell because, you know, every identifying bit of
5410680	5414680	furniture or surface or whatever is covered in flesh.
5415680	5418400	But as I said, there, there are two doors.
5418400	5426360	There's a sort of side door that looks like it may go to some steps down and then
5426360	5430960	there's another door that's going deeper into the house.
5431480	5433920	Yeah, actually, I mean, I forgot to do this for Dr.
5433920	5434640	Coombs earlier.
5434640	5439400	Now that the rest of you are there on the doorstep within the house, dealing with,
5440360	5443800	you know, everything, the sensory overload that this is providing.
5443960	5447480	I do want San rolls off the rest of you, everyone except for Freddy.
5451560	5452000	Three.
5452600	5455320	I failed a 40 on a 28.
5457320	5458400	I passed.
5458560	5459920	So is it just Dr.
5459920	5463840	Coombs who loses a D3 of San?
5466320	5466800	A two.
5467280	5473760	So I think what the way this evidence is an involuntary action is, as the group
5473760	5476120	of you are stepping in, Dr.
5476120	5480680	Coombs is just there hesitating on the doorstep with the frayed hose suddenly
5480680	5483200	getting pulled taut and creaking a bit.
5483640	5488040	You can see some of the cracks and getting that bit longer as he's just standing
5488040	5492000	there digging the nails of his shoes into this flesh.
5492720	5497000	I told you guys that I think this might be a digestive tract and you guys just want to
5497000	5497600	walk in.
5497640	5501400	Well, but it seemed like he was getting digested down there on the floor, right?
5501800	5503840	This would be the upper part of the body.
5503840	5507040	I mean, essentially all the body just exists to support digestion.
5507040	5511720	So, you know, we're basically just a tube from our mouth to our asshole, but.
5513560	5514760	That's what they taught us, correct?
5515280	5517840	Yeah, that's, that's what, that's what any doctor would tell you.
5517840	5519040	Day one in medical school.
5525520	5529320	Listen, I understand you had a traumatic experience the last time you went to this
5529320	5532320	property, but we got the nails in our shoes now.
5533320	5537280	And I step a couple of times into the, into the floor to see if I slip.
5537320	5540760	You don't see no more slipping, no more sliding.
5541000	5544440	We can maybe, unfortunately, I think we're going to have to go up to that fucking
5544440	5547880	creepy moist curtain and check out the light in that room.
5547920	5551960	But it seems like we have the tools to do that now without getting sucked in by the
5551960	5553920	floor. We got the hose.
5554240	5555480	We're all holding hands.
5555640	5557640	They're just like kernels of corn.
5558240	5561880	We just go straight through, uh, unbothered.
5563440	5564720	That's exactly right, doctor.
5564720	5567960	I live my life by three rules and three rules only.
5568840	5572960	Take chances, make mistakes, get messy.
5573720	5576760	And I, I, my three rules are live, laugh, and love.
5578120	5580160	And you got, it's just time to live, Dr.
5580160	5583000	Coombs. I love you.
5585640	5587000	We're going to laugh about this later.
5587320	5588480	We're going to laugh about this later.
5588480	5594520	So I, I, I, I, I, uh, corn.
5594560	5596160	Sure. We're like, we're like corn.
5596320	5599520	Yeah. We'll go on. That's the one that works for Tracer food.
5599680	5601120	Yeah, of course. I like that one.
5605080	5609240	Okay. And with that, you start heading in.
5609400	5614240	So you're going through into, yeah, this little
5614240	5619000	corridor that's got a door on the other side, uh, and then
5619000	5622000	seems to go round to your left.
5622360	5623040	I continue.
5623120	5626040	Yeah. If you're following the corridor around on your,
5630600	5631760	Oh, perfect.
5632560	5634840	Zach has changed his background.
5635120	5636280	Zoom background. Yeah.
5636360	5638440	To the magic school bus inside the human body.
5639440	5643040	Take chances, make mistakes, get messy.
5645240	5648960	I, as you're following the corridor around, the walls are
5648960	5653520	getting less flashy around here, but the carpet is still
5653520	5655400	very, very moist here.
5655640	5661080	There's still a kind of constant, as you're walking
5661080	5666280	across it and you come across and you can see, you know, in
5666280	5669840	the few lights that are coming around that to your left is
5669840	5673600	probably the ruins of an old conservatory round to the
5673840	5679320	right is the sort of main entrance with staircases up the
5679320	5683200	ruins, the front door and doorways to a couple of other
5683200	5684400	interior rooms.
5684880	5689040	Can we do another, like gauging the sound and everything, just
5689040	5690720	taking our surroundings one more time around here.
5690720	5692360	So if there's anything that's changed, another word for
5692360	5692760	deeper in.
5692760	5696760	Yeah. In fact, if each one of you wants to give me a, I'll
5696760	5699400	tell you what, I'll let you choose either a listener, a spot
5699400	5702600	hidden role, they'll tell you different things.
5703200	5710680	I'm taking a spot hidden and I failed a 35 on a 25.
5711560	5712080	Failed.
5715840	5717160	I got a nine on a spot hidden.
5717400	5719640	I did a hard success on a listen.
5719680	5720040	Okay.
5720080	5721360	So you pick up two different things.
5721360	5727960	What Thomas feels is, yeah, there is movement of the air in
5727960	5728760	the house.
5729360	5733360	Uh, for a moment you thought it was like a breeze coming in
5733360	5737480	through the front door, but it's not that, that the movement
5737480	5742200	of the air seems to change direction on a slow, regular
5742200	5743040	basis.
5744440	5747960	Like, like, um, like breath?
5748440	5748960	Hmm.
5750360	5751200	Something like that.
5751200	5759680	What, uh, what Freddie notices with his listen role is that,
5759680	5762200	yeah, it's like what you heard earlier.
5762200	5770120	There is a sound coming from upstairs, a sort of rasping,
5770120	5771520	groaning sound.
5772040	5774640	I mean, it's difficult to discern because it's so low.
5775160	5776800	Uh, it's almost infrasound.
5776800	5778560	It's rumbling through the house.
5778560	5782800	But you, you reckon it is originating upstairs.
5782960	5786440	I mean, I think we got to go upstairs to that flush curtain room.
5786600	5790600	If we've learned one thing, so when you enter a house and you
5790600	5793840	hear something upstairs, you got to go up to the bedroom and
5793840	5796840	kill the sleeping occupant, you got to go up to the bedroom and
5796840	5797880	kill the sleeping occupant.
5797920	5798480	Yes, exactly.
5798480	5799440	That's what tonight is tonight.
5805160	5807720	Do we, do we feel like that worked at will for us last time?
5807720	5811040	Is that, is that the, I thought this is, we're standing on there.
5811040	5811600	Okay, gotcha.
5811760	5812800	He's dead, isn't he?
5812800	5817960	Is this something like, uh, is this a saying that there is or, um, yeah.
5818400	5818760	Yeah.
5818800	5820240	Ah, I've not heard that one.
5820520	5821560	You're not from around here.
5821640	5822320	Don't worry about it.
5823040	5824320	Yes, I agree.
5825040	5828440	It's just like, what they say, kill the sleeping.
5836360	5836880	Okay.
5837200	5837800	Oh, okay.
5837800	5842840	Well, with, with, uh, with a song in your heart and murder on your mind,
5842840	5844840	you make your way up the stairs.
5849840	5850960	We got this guys.
5853720	5853880	Yeah.
5853880	5854720	Is your fiddle wet?
5857440	5857880	Yeah.
5858200	5859880	Can I give us Bardic inspiration?
5859880	5868520	Well, again, the carpet, the stairs going up is, is moist.
5869000	5873200	Uh, and when you get up to the landing, there are a few doors.
5873200	5878600	I mean, there's, you've got short corridors going off on other side, but you're fairly
5878680	5883720	certain, you know, off the back of the rolls you made earlier, that the main movement of
5883720	5887640	the air is coming through the double doors of what you assume is the master bedroom
5887640	5888720	directly in front of you.
5888960	5889440	All right.
5890200	5896160	On the backs of the rolls that we had earlier, I'm fairly certain that the air is
5896160	5900840	pushing in and out through these double doors, which is likely the master bedroom.
5901440	5902480	This is my whisper.
5902680	5904760	So we're all keeping our voices down.
5905920	5909400	We're going to all go in two by two, right?
5909440	5910120	Double doors.
5910160	5911320	It can fit two by two.
5911800	5914400	So I say we push in double doors wide open.
5914400	5916320	We can all, we can all just rest for that.
5916560	5923560	It's two doors, wide open, two doors, four men, one rush, doors down.
5926360	5928800	What would Neil put do is what I'm trying to say.
5929800	5930360	Die.
5932480	5933200	He was sleeping.
5933760	5934080	All right.
5934080	5937200	So we'll let's, um, let's rush in there.
5937320	5937760	Okay.
5937800	5938960	You rush in.
5939480	5943800	There is a single flickering light in the ceiling here.
5944400	5951520	It's not giving off much light and yeah, it keeps cutting out.
5951520	5956120	Obviously the moisture has got into the works and it's just flickering on and off.
5956680	5965640	But you can make out that there, again, the walls here are disturbingly fleshy.
5965640	5968120	It's not the same color.
5968120	5973160	It doesn't look like the same kind of tissue as you saw downstairs.
5973480	5974920	It's, it's something different.
5974920	5976360	It's pulsating.
5976800	5988000	There is on the far wall, this, well, I guess the only word for it is orifice, this
5988680	5993960	pulsating hole in the wall, this large hole, and you can see something
5993960	5996840	worm-like moving around inside it.
5997840	5998480	How big?
5998640	5999480	Huge.
5999520	6001840	I mean, like larger than any one of you.
6002040	6006560	Does it look like it's sticking out like a tongue or it's not sticking out
6006560	6011800	entirely, but yeah, now that your mind has made the connection with the
6011800	6015240	tongue, that is absolutely a tongue.
6015840	6017040	You see what I'm saying, boys?
6017080	6018120	Mouth to asshole.
6018800	6019600	That's all we are.
6019600	6021280	That's all this monster house is.
6022320	6026600	And I think, I think that is a good chance for another sand roll here,
6026960	6033520	particularly here at that point, you can hear this rumbling sound
6033680	6035440	coming out of the hole.
6036600	6038880	I got an 88.
6039280	6040320	I got a 94.
6040480	6048280	The rumbling sound coming out of the hole seems to be saying Rothstein.
6049440	6050800	Oh shit.
6052440	6054480	I'm fucking sorry, Carl.
6054880	6057440	Are you acquainted with this goddamn monster house?
6060600	6062320	Did anyone pass their sand roll?
6062840	6063240	Okay.
6063240	6065440	So each one of you loses a D6 of sand.
6068800	6070320	Oh my God.
6071280	6072920	I rolled a big old sixers.
6073240	6074480	I got a six as well.
6075640	6076360	I got a four.
6077200	6078480	And what about Freddie?
6078800	6079480	Oh, I passed.
6079480	6080880	I got a 19 on my sand check.
6080920	6081640	Oh, you passed.
6081920	6083880	So, so, so you still lose one.
6084000	6084360	Okay.
6084520	6084840	Okay.
6084840	6086280	For the two of you who lost six.
6086280	6088120	Can I have intelligence rolls please?
6090600	6091560	I failed that one.
6091560	6093440	Also a 65 on a 60.
6093480	6095360	I passed 37 on a 70.
6095480	6095760	Dr.
6095760	6099560	Coombes failed, so you failed your intelligence roll.
6099680	6100200	That's good.
6100200	6101720	You're not having a bad and madness.
6102320	6102800	Dr.
6102800	6107080	Rothstein on the other hand is, I think, you know, that makes sense.
6107080	6107960	Total sense.
6107960	6108920	I heard your name.
6110280	6112400	I think at that point, Dr.
6112400	6117920	Rothstein in blind panic runs, just runs out of the room.
6118240	6124360	Suddenly that rope that you've got is, well, rather the hose is stretched taut.
6124840	6129000	And well, we've already established you're not going to pass a group luck roll here.
6129400	6132080	So that's the point at which it just snaps.
6132120	6135760	This frayed rubber just, just snaps completely.
6136360	6142960	And the rest of you, as you stumble and fall as this jerks, just lose Rothstein
6142960	6146280	as he runs off somewhere within the house.
6146640	6148400	You don't see where he's gone.
6154200	6158000	From a role-playing perspective, we would definitely want to go after him.
6158280	6163200	But from a game, gamey perspective where we are trapped inside this
6163200	6164880	monster house that wants to eat us.
6165760	6169480	Uh, I don't know.
6171960	6172240	Yeah.
6172240	6173200	What's the answer there?
6173200	6173920	Cause I don't know.
6174280	6177480	Well, I don't want to say what I'm nevermind.
6177560	6178200	Fuck him.
6178920	6181200	I don't want to give Luke or the DM any ideas.
6181240	6183840	So I'm not going to continue my sentence.
6184920	6185720	Holy shit.
6185720	6187080	We got to get them boys.
6190640	6195560	Coombs, I think is, is distracted through all this by the fact that the mouth,
6195600	6198680	the wall tongue mouth has just spoken.
6199800	6204760	And he's going to kind of look wide-eyed at it and say, you, you can, you can, you
6204760	6206280	can talk, you can talk.
6208880	6217600	And the voice again, just that it takes a deep breath in that just moves all the
6217600	6222960	air suddenly quite fast through the room around you enough to ruffle your hair.
6223520	6226640	This time, it just says a bit louder.
6227520	6234560	Rothstein, help me.
6236000	6238560	How, how can, how can Rothstein help you?
6240480	6240800	We got it.
6240800	6242000	We got to get Carl back in here.
6242000	6243400	He, he could help.
6243400	6246840	It sounds like, well, I think you're doing a great job right now talking to the,
6247240	6249360	you know, whole house.
6249800	6254080	So like, uh, that's definitely, uh, Austin Hawks, right?
6254120	6256760	Like Sedgwick turned Hawks into a fucking house.
6257040	6261200	So let's, uh, keep talking to them, I guess.
6261200	6262480	And let's get some answers.
6262800	6265920	Are you, did you hear that house house mouth?
6266240	6268240	That's are you, are you Austin?
6268280	6271680	I'm less worried about if you're Austin Hawks and I'm more worried
6271680	6272960	about how we can help you.
6273320	6273840	That too.
6273840	6274120	Yep.
6274160	6276160	I'd like to know the answer to both, please.
6276200	6277720	But you're talking so slow.
6277720	6278800	I think we don't have time.
6278800	6279160	Maybe.
6280280	6282640	And again, it's after another deep breath.
6282920	6291000	It just goes Rothstein and this time the walls shake.
6291520	6291800	All right.
6291800	6292040	All right.
6292040	6292360	We'll get them.
6292360	6292720	We'll get them.
6292720	6293080	We'll get them.
6293080	6293400	Hang on.
6293400	6293760	Hang on.
6295200	6295840	Carl.
6298480	6299000	Okay.
6299440	6302640	Uh, can I have a luck roll for Dr.
6302640	6303680	Rothstein please?
6304200	6306160	A 94.
6306960	6308040	So I fail.
6308920	6309680	Okay.
6310400	6317920	So yeah, you basically at this stage, obviously just running off the memory
6317920	6325600	you had run back out through the way you came back in, but in your panic, you have
6325600	6328080	clearly forgotten about that hole in the floor.
6331480	6332240	Oh no.
6333160	6334280	Yes.
6334880	6337920	So you sort of come out of your, your fugue state.
6338640	6339040	Yeah.
6339280	6345040	As, as your foot just goes down through this hole and you're off balance, you've
6345040	6351320	gone down, you slammed your face down into this pulsating, warm flesh at the floor.
6351520	6357040	And again, you're in a very similar situation that Freddie was earlier of
6357040	6359800	just beginning to slip down this hole.
6360200	6368840	Down below, you can hear this, as well as this horrible smell, you can hear just
6368840	6374520	this dripping liquid and the sound of liquid moving around and you can give me
6374720	6378600	a listen roll as well, just to see whether you can pick up something else.
6381320	6381720	Fail.
6381800	6383160	33 on a 20.
6383560	6386480	No, you can, you can hear, you can hear it.
6386480	6388360	Like I say, liquid moving around.
6388840	6389760	Spend your luck.
6390560	6391720	Uh, not yet.
6391720	6392960	I'm not going to spend my luck yet.
6396080	6396320	Yeah.
6396320	6399280	Don't spend your luck while you're being eaten alive by the house.
6400760	6401840	Not for a listen roll.
6403360	6408680	On the other hand, I mean, you can hear that there is something else down there.
6408680	6412080	I mean, yeah, maybe if you just let yourself slide down a bit further, you
6412080	6417960	could push the roll and get a better listen.
6417960	6418320	Yep.
6420800	6422800	No, a 35 on a 20 this time.
6423440	6424360	Oh, okay.
6424760	6426880	Oh my God, you idiot.
6427880	6428640	I love you.
6430080	6431240	This makes me so happy.
6432200	6437240	So in the process of doing that, there is suddenly, I mean, you put your head
6437240	6443160	underneath and yeah, you do actually at that point hear what it is that you were
6443760	6449000	struggling to, which is just the sound of someone crying.
6449440	6456040	It sounds like a little girl crying somewhere inside, somewhere down below.
6456400	6462040	And, and yeah, I mean, as you strain your head down just to get a better, a better
6462160	6467800	lock on where she is, that's the point at which just the remaining bit of the floor
6467800	6472040	holding you up collapses and you fall down into darkness.
6472320	6481400	Yeah, this is a real Hannah Montana moment for me because I really wanted to know
6481400	6484640	what was down there, but I really didn't want Frederick Millen the first to fall
6484640	6489000	down there and I really got the best of both worlds out of this.
6490520	6494200	I, the whole time I'm like, I don't, I'm not familiar with Hannah Montana enough
6494200	6499680	to, I was like, you really brought it together at the end there.
6499680	6504440	And really at the, uh, with a story like this, it's not about, uh, how fast you get
6504440	6507840	there or what's waiting on the other side, but it's the climb.
6510760	6512240	I think this house needs a wrecking ball.
6518640	6519960	A party in the USA.
6519960	6529880	You can't knock down the worst big old vore house in Crawley.
6532680	6534120	Her godmother's Dolly Parton.
6534600	6535040	Okay.
6535360	6537240	I was wondering where we got to Dolly.
6540240	6543120	I was like, are we just saying things associated with musicians?
6549960	6578360	How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the
